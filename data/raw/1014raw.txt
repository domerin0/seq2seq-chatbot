manhattan lsland derives its name from its earliest inhabitants ... ... the manhattan lndians .
they were a peaceful tribe , setting traps , fishing , hunting .
every july , when the heat became unbearable ... ... they would send their wives and children away .
up the river to the highlands ... ... or , if they could afford it , to the seashore .
setting traps , fishing and hunting .
our story has nothing whatsoever to do with lndians .
lt plays 500 years later .
portland , rockland , plymouth and bar harbor .
departing at 6 : 30 ....
we brought up the subject to show how nothing has changed .
manhattan wives and children are still sent away in the summer .
setting traps , fishing and hunting .
we want you to meet a typical manhattan husband .
this is mr. richard sherman , his wife , helen , and son , ricky .
ricky , what are you doing ?
he' s an interplanetary spy .
i blasted him into dust .
cut it out .
you' re going to maine , not to mars .
goodbye , helen .
goodbye , richard .
why can' t daddy come up with us ?
daddy has to stay and make money .
don' t worry .
i' il be fine .
how will i get my allowance ?
i' il mail it to you .
you promised to eat properly and not smoke .
and you promised not to drink .
i' il call you tonight at 10 .
goodbye , helen .
goodbye , ricky .
let me kiss you .
take that thing off .
he' s shutting off my oxygen !
come on , we' il miss the train .
helen , ricky , the paddle !
you forgot the paddle !
ticket , mister ?
my son forgot the paddle .
sorry , only those holding tickets admitted through the gates .
oh , no , not me .
and i' m not gonna smoke either .
look at them .
awful .
the train isn' t even out of the station .
gotta get back to the office .
man , is this hot !
he works for a publishing firm , brady & company .
they publish those pocket editions , two bits in any drugstore .
old mr. brady is the boss , but mr. sherman is the key man .
he keeps the whole operation together .
ln the 25 cent book business , you can sell anything .
even the old , dreary classics .
the trick is to soup up the title ... ... and get an interesting cover .
lt' s all a question of imagination ... ... and mr. sherman has a lot of imagination .
that' il be all , miss morris .
oh , no , not me .
not me .
and i' m not gonna smoke either .
some husbands run wild because their wives are away .
do anything they want .
like charlie lederer .
annie was gone two days ... ... when charlie got himself tattooed .
green dragon on his chest , butterfly on the shoulders .
not me .
oh , no , work , work
i' il work till 6 , then have dinner at the saloon
no !
no saloon , no drinking like dr. summers said .
i know , i' il try that vegetarian restaurant .
health food , that' s the stuff .
the human body is a very delicate machine .
you can' t run it on martinis and goulash .
especially in this hot weather .
miss , may i have the check , please ?
yes , sir .
let' s see .
we had the special , the soybean hamburger ... ... with french fried soybeans .
soybean sherbet and peppermint tea .
i had a cocktail to start .
yes , we had the sauerkraut juice on the rocks .
you' il be proud to know that the meal was only 260 calories .
i am proud .
that' il be $1 . 27 .
keep the change .
we don' t permit tipping .
i can put it in our nudist camp fund .
you do that .
oh , thank you , sir .
it' s a worthy cause .
we must bring the message to the people .
to unmask our suffocating bodies and let them breathe again .
without clothes there' d be no sickness and no war .
can you imagine two armies on the battlefield ... ... no uniforms , completely nude ?
no way of telling friend from foe , all brothers together .
just a moment , sir .
you forgot your paddle .
thank you .
i like this house .
why does helen want to move into one of those ... ... buildings out of riot in cellblock 11 ?
so much nicer here .
just three apartments .
ours , kaufmans upstairs ... ... and two guys on the top , interior decorators or something .
it' s peaceful with everybody gone .
sure is peaceful .
no howdy doody .
no captain video .
no smell of cooking .
no " what happened at the office ?
i shot mr. brady in the head , made violent love to miss morris ... ... and set fire to 300, 000 copies of little women .
that' s what happened .
what can happen at the office ?
it sure is peaceful .
use the opener , richard .
carbonated water , citric acid , corn syrup ... ... artificial raspberry flavoring ... ... vegetable colors and preservative .
why is this stuff better for you ... ... than a little scotch and a twist of lemon ?
i' d really like to know .
helen' s gonna call at 10 .
i guess i better do a little reading .
i brought dr. brubaker' s manuscript home with me
ricky !
okay , where is it ?
where is the other one ?
i know it' s lurking here somewhere to get me .
where is captain video' s other roller skate ?
now , who' s that ?
yes , what is it ?
i' m sorry to bother you .
i forgot my key , so i had to ring your bell .
it' s perfectly all right .
anytime .
anything else i can do for you ?
would you mind pressing it again ?
my fan' s caught in the door .
oh , of course .
thanks .
do you live in our building ?
ln the kaufmans ' apartment .
they' re in europe .
i know you' il be happy here .
it' s a very quiet building .
no dogs , no children , just two interior decorators .
and you , and of course , me .
you all right ?
oh , sure , fine .
well , good night .
good night .
well , now .
maybe i should have asked her in for a drink .
make her feel at home .
after all , we' re one big family here .
oh , no , no .
i' ve got to get to work on the brubaker book .
i' m gonna talk to him about it tomorrow , so i better .
of man and the unconscious , by dr. ludwig brubaker .
some title .
we' il have to soup this one up , that' s for sure .
ten o' clock .
helen' s not gonna call till 10 : 00 .
i hope this thing keeps me awake till 10 : 00 .
the repressed urge in the middle aged male .
lts roots and lts consequences .
helen has a lot of nerve calling me at 10 : 00 .
it shows a definite lack of trust .
what does she think i' m gonna do ?
start smoking ?
get drunk ?
or tattooed ?
charlie ....
big , green dragon .
i bet she thinks i' il have girls up here .
that' s terrible .
seven years we' ve been married .
i' ve never done anything like that .
don' t think i couldn' t have either .
because i could have , plenty .
plenty .
don' t laugh , helen .
i happen to be very attractive to women .
you' re attractive to me , but i' m used to you .
this isn' t a thing one likes to tell his wife ... ... but women have been throwing themselves at me for years .
that' s right , beautiful ones , plenty of them .
acres and acres of them .
name one .
it' s hard just offhand , but there have been plenty of them .
you asked for it .
take my secretary , for instance .
to you , she' s just miss morris , a piece of office furniture .
ten fingers to type my letters .
well , let me tell you .
did you type this letter ?
yes , mr. sherman .
there are six errors in the first paragraph .
what is the matter with you ?
what' s the matter with you ?
i' il tell you what' s the matter .
i' m in love with you .
i have been since the day i came here .
deeply , madly , desperately , all consumingly .
and to you i' m nothing , just a piece of furniture .
ten fingers to type your letters with .
mr. sherman , take a look at me .
i' m a woman , do you hear ?
with flesh and blood and nerves and feelings !
i' m in love with you .
i need you , i want you .
i want you ....
that will be all , miss morris .
you remember that torn shirt , helen ?
now you know how it happened .
it got torn at the laundry , that' s how it happened .
what an imagination !
i walk into a room and they sense it .
i arouse something in them , i bother them .
it' s a kind of animal thing i' ve got .
it' s quite extraordinary .
the only extraordinary thing is your imagination .
last winter when i had my appendix out ... ... do you remember the nurse ?
that sweet , little old lady with the gray hair ?
that was the day nurse .
you never saw the night nurse , a certain miss finch .
poor miss finch .
she fought it as long as she could .
but then one night ....
richard !
miss finch , please , not again tonight .
we have so little time .
soon they' il take out your stitches and i' il have lost you forever .
please , miss finch .
there is such a thing as ethics .
remember , you are a registered nurse .
ethics ?
once i had ethics .
once i was young .
once i had ideals .
i was registered !
and then you happened .
miss finch , for five nights now you' ve been taking my pulse .
have you never noticed this simple band of gold ?
you' ve bothered me since they wheeled you into the operating room .
i can' t understand it .
there' s this animal thing about you .
please , miss finch , my adhesions .
let' s crash out of here .
let' s steal an ambulance .
you' re not fit to wear that uniform .
you' re rotten to the core .
beat me till your arms ache .
i' il only come crawling back for more .
you' re forcing me to take measures ... ... to protect you from yourself .
no , no !
put me down !
put me down !
the moth and the flame , that' s what it was .
poor miss finch .
i hope i didn' t singe her wings too badly .
you read too many books and see too many movies .
for instance , take elaine .
your best friend , your bridesmaid .
let me tell you about that weekend in westport last summer .
you were playing canasta , suspecting nothing .
elaine and i went for a walk .
walk !
we went swimming , moonlight swimming .
what is this strange animal thing you have ?
it bothers me .
it' s bothered me since the first time i saw you .
and it' il bother me always , from here to eternity .
you must fight it , elaine .
remember , i belong to another .
richard !
this can never be .
i have a devoted , trusting wife at home .
and a freckle faced little space cadet .
richard !
so , helen , in light of the circumstances ... ... l resent your calling to check up on me .
don' t worry about me .
although i have tremendous personal magnetism ... ... l also have strength of character .
and tremendous imagination .
you' ve begun to imagine it cinemascope , with stereophonic sound .
well ... ... back to work .
the repressed urge in the middle aged male . lts roots and lts consequences .
helen is worried .
i just know she is .
she plays it cool , but she can' t fool me .
why else would she call in the middle of the night ?
she probably figures she isn' t as young as she was .
she' s 31 .
one day she' il wake up and find her looks are gone .
no wonder she' s worried .
i don' t look different than i did when i was 28 .
it' s not my fault , it' s just a simple biological fact .
women age quicker than men .
i won' t look different when i' m 60 .
i have that kind of a face .
everybody' il think she' s my mother .
hello , mother ?
oh , helen !
i wasn' t expecting you to call till 10 .
everything all right ?
everything' s fine here .
seems pretty empty without you , though .
just sitting out on the terrace ... ... drinking , getting fractured on raspberry soda .
little ricky okay ?
oh , he did ?
he hasn' t done that for a long time .
it' s the excitement .
that' s nice .
who did you meet on the train ?
tom mackenzie ?
what' s he doing up there ?
my advice is to avoid tom like the plague .
i don' t want him carrying ricky' s kayak .
lf anybody carries ricky' s kayak , it' s gonna be you .
how' s the weather ?
cool ?
it' s steaming here , like an oven .
yeah , i' m pretty tired myself .
night .
good night , darling .
the repressed urge in the middle aged male .
lts roots and lts consequences .
maybe a twist of lemon would help this , or a shot of worcestershire .
hey , what' s the big idea ? !
you wanna kill somebody ?
what' s the matter ?
this great cast iron pot ... ... practically killed me .
oh , it' s you .
well , hello again .
what happened ?
oh , the tomato plant fell over !
it sure did .
i' m terribly sorry .
it' s nothing .
look at that poor chair !
i' il pay for it .
i hope it' s not some priceless antique .
it' s just early sears , roebuck .
lf there' s anything i can do ....
do what ?
there' s nothing to worry about .
i' m certainly glad you' re not mad .
now don' t touch it .
i' il have the janitor come down ... ... and take care of it .
good night .
hey there !
wait a minute .
yes ?
i' il tell you one thing you could do .
lf you' re not doing anything else more important .
would you have a drink with me ?
thanks , i' d love it .
you would ?
sure , it' d be fun .
let me just go and put something on .
i get dressed in the kitchen .
when it' s hot like this , i keep my undies in the icebox .
ln the icebox ?
see you in a minute .
ln the icebox !
i really need it , dr. murphy .
honest i do .
don' t worry , dr. murphy .
just one , that' s all .
all those lovely injurious tars and resins .
and now a small concession from dr. summers ?
doctor , let' s be reasonable .
can' t fly on one wing .
okay , i' il put some soda in it .
do you want to come in for a drink ?
i' d love it .
just like that .
a beautiful girl too .
must be a model or actress .
atmosphere .
i need a little atmosphere .
tomato plant .
fan caught in the door .
what am i doing ?
this is absolutely ridiculous .
the first night helen leaves , i' m bringing dames in here .
take it easy .
there' s nothing wrong with asking a neighbor down for a drink .
i hope she doesn' t get the wrong idea .
lf this dame thinks she' s in for a big time , she' s in for a surprise .
one drink and out !
i' m a happily married man .
maybe a little soft music .
she' s probably getting all fixed up .
she' il probably wear some ice cold evening dress .
let' s see .
debussy , ravel .
stravinsky .
stravinsky' d only scare her .
here' s the baby , rachmaninoff .
give her the full treatment .
come in like gangbusters .
good old rachmaninoff .
the second piano concerto .
never misses .
you came .
i' m so glad .
rachmaninoff .
the second piano concerto .
it isn' t fair .
not fair ?
why ?
every time i hear it , i go to pieces .
oh ?
may i sit next to you ?
please do .
it shakes me , it quakes me .
it makes me goose pimply all over .
i don' t know where i am , or who i am , or what i' m doing .
don' t stop , don' t stop .
don' t ever stop .
why did you stop ?
you know why i stopped .
why ?
because .
because now i' m going to kiss you ... ... very quickly and very hard .
one moment , my dear .
you came .
yeah , i came for the rugs .
the rugs ?
what is it you want ?
the bedroom rugs .
i promised mrs. sherman .
mr. kruhulik
it' s on account of the moths .
forget the rugs .
your wife is gonna find them full of big , gaping holes .
who' il get blamed ?
the janitor .
pick them up tomorrow while i' m at the office .
i can' t .
i' m taking the missus and the kids to the train .
they' re going to the country .
all right , in the afternoon then .
i can' t do it then .
i' m going to the barber in the afternoon .
i' m gonna take a shave , haircut , manicure , the whole works .
i couldn' t care less .
come tomorrow evening , just not now .
tomorrow evening ?
do you know the maid from 531 park ?
you must' ve seen her walking down the street with her fat poodle .
what ?
come now , we' re both summer bachelors .
don' t let' s be naive .
good night , mr. kruhulik !
big , fat poodle !
he' s got four kids .
something happens to people in the summer .
it' s disgraceful .
it' s late .
where is she ?
this is ridiculous .
she could' ve been here , had her drink and gone home already .
lce , we' il need ice .
coming !
coming , coming !
hi !
it' s me .
don' t you remember ?
the tomato from upstairs .
of course , the tomato .
come in , please .
honestly , i don' t know how it happened .
i was watering the plants .
i promised the kaufmans i would .
i was using the cocktail shaker .
it' s the only thing i found .
a little silver one .
then there was this terrible crash .
you could' ve been killed .
it' s probably criminal negligence .
you could' ve sued somebody .
me , probably .
well , not you .
you' d have been dead .
your lawyers could have .
case dismissed .
what would you like to drink ?
i don' t know .
anything .
you have a nice place here .
you live here alone ?
yes , i live here alone .
all alone .
it' s a roller skate .
mine , you know .
yours ?
it' s adjustable .
i skate a lot .
what would you like to drink ?
you do drink ?
sure , i drink like a fish .
do you have gin ?
of course .
you mean straight gin ?
no , gin and soda , i guess .
gin and soda ?
that' s wrong .
how do you drink gin ?
there' s gin and tonic , and gin and vermouth , that' s a martini .
that sounds cool .
i' il have a glass of that .
a big , tall one .
big , tall martini .
this is a nicer apartment than the kaufmans ' .
for instance , the kaufmans have no stairs .
hey , where do they lead to ?
no place .
no place ?
a stairway to nowhere .
that' s elegant .
i wouldn' t say elegant .
you see , this used to be a duplex .
the landlord made two apartments out of it by boarding up your floor .
oh , yes , i remember that patch in the floor .
i dropped my cuticle pusher down the crack .
cuticle pusher .
yeah .
well , here you are .
big , tall martini .
thanks .
you' re welcome .
very good .
maybe it needs a bit more sugar .
i' d strongly advise against putting sugar in a martini .
you would ?
why ?
well ....
take my word for it .
no sugar in a martini .
back home they put sugar in martinis .
back home ?
where ?
denver , colorado .
hey , you' ve got air conditioning !
how does it work ?
put it on .
sure !
i got air conditioning in every room .
don' t the kaufmans ?
no , it' s just terrible up there .
that' s why i bought the electric fan .
this feels just elegant .
i' m just not made for the heat .
it' s my first summer in new york , and it' s killing me .
yesterday , i tried to sleep in the bathtub .
just lying up to my neck in cold water .
good idea .
but the faucet kept dripping .
it was keeping me awake .
you know what i did ?
i pushed my big toe up the faucet .
they call that american know how .
then my toe got stuck and i couldn' t get it out again .
you couldn' t ?
but there' s a phone in the bathroom .
i was able to call the plumber .
you called him ?
he was very nice , even though it was sunday .
he rushed right over .
everything come out okay ?
sure .
but it was embarrassing .
i can see how it might' ve been .
honestly , i almost died .
there i was with a strange plumber ... ... and no polish on my toenails .
you got a cigarette around ?
a cigarette ?
sure .
coming up .
here you are .
are you afraid of burglars ?
i' m just trying not to smoke .
lf you don' t see them , you don' t think about them .
it' s not 100 % / foolproof .
it' s only a theory .
all you do is spend half your life dragging ladders back and forth .
you could break a leg .
it' s just ridiculous .
at the club we had this girl who only smoked cigars .
she only did it to make herself look older .
what club was that ?
this club i lived at .
i hated it .
you had to be in by 1 a . m .
now i can stay out all night .
i was glad when they practically asked me to leave .
why did they ask you to leave ?
it was so silly .
i posed for a picture in u. s. camera and they got all upset .
what was wrong with the picture ?
i was it was one of these artistic pictures .
on the beach , with driftwood .
it got honorable mention .
ln u. s. camera ?
it was called " textures .
you' d see three different kinds .
the driftwood , the sand and me .
i got $25 an hour .
it took hours and hours .
very interesting line of work .
i don' t do modeling anymore .
now i' m on tv every other week .
the dazzledent toothpaste hour .
you' re an actress ?
sort of .
i do the commercial part .
it' s a good part .
they put gray makeup on my teeth ... ... to show ordinary toothpaste .
then they wipe it off to show how dazzledent works .
i sit like this for about 14 seconds ... ... and i get to speak lines too .
i had onions at lunch , i had garlic dressing at dinner .
but he' il never know .
i stay kissing sweet ... ... the new dazzledent way .
you do that beautifully .
thank you .
people don' t realize , but when i show my teeth on tv ... ... l appear before more people ... ... than sarah bernhardt ever did .
something to think about .
it certainly is .
wish i were old enough to have seen her .
was she magnificent ?
i wouldn' t know .
i' m not that old myself .
i guess you' re not really .
i' m 39 .
i will be in august .
at the moment i' m 38 .
thirty eight ?
i was 22 , day before yesterday .
i didn' t do anything about it .
i didn' t tell anyone .
i did buy a bottle of champagne .
i thought i' d sit there , drink it by myself .
that sounds absolutely sad .
oh , no !
it would' ve been just elegant , lying in a bath , drinking champagne .
but i couldn' t get the bottle open .
you couldn' t ?
there' s nothing to it .
you think you could get it open ?
i' m pretty sure i could .
i' ve got an idea .
i' il go up and get it .
it' s in the icebox with the potato chips and my underwear .
do you have champagne glasses ?
yes .
good !
we' il have a wonderful time .
the man says it' s very good champagne .
shall i bring the potato chips too ?
sure , let' s shoot the works .
honorable mention in u. s. camera .
u. s. camera .
news events .
children and animals .
the human body .
champagne glasses .
champagne glasses .
phone , phone .
where' s the phone ?
hello ?
who is it ?
oh , helen .
well , this is a surprise !
and a pleasant one .
how are you ?
sure , i' m all right .
why shouldn' t i be all right ?
ln what way do i sound funny ?
everything is just fine .
what' s your problem ?
did i know ricky forgot his paddle ?
i' ve been dragging that thing all over new york .
sure , i will .
i' il send it off first thing .
good night .
who ?
who dropped in after dinner ?
tom mackenzie ?
good old tom .
how is he ?
drinking ?
who , me ?
whatever gave you that idea ?
i was sitting here reading a book about driftwood .
we may publish it .
it' s interesting .
some of the formations are
i' d better hang up .
the bathtub is running over .
good night .
night !
sorry , i was on the phone .
a friend of mine in the country
oh , say !
it isn' t right to drink champagne in pants .
would you mind fastening my straps ?
oh , sure .
sure .
potato chips , champagne .
you really think you can get it open ?
oh , yeah .
i' ve opened one or two before in my life .
it' s simply a matter of pressure and counter pressure .
there she goes .
you' ve sure got powerful thumbs .
i used to play a lot of badminton .
get the glasses .
quick , quick !
the glasses !
pour it .
seems to be stuck .
that' s silly .
give it a good yank .
this never happened before .
it must be the vacuum .
the bubbles create a vacuum .
let me see if i can do it .
i' il try to twist it .
you' re married !
i am ?
yes , i am .
i knew it .
i could tell .
you look married .
actually , my wife and i are separated .
separated in the sense that she went away for the summer .
any children ?
no .
well , just one very little one .
it' s cold in there .
finger' s getting numb .
i could call the plumber .
he' s very good at this .
no , let' s keep the plumber out of it .
grab hold of the piano .
careful , i had my appendix out last year .
are you all right ?
fine .
do you wanna waste it now that you know i' m married ?
i think it' s wonderful that you' re married .
just elegant .
you do ?
of course .
i wouldn' t be lying on the floor with some man if he wasn' t married .
that' s an interesting line of reasoning .
with a married man it' s so simple .
i mean , it can' t possibly ever get drastic .
have a potato chip .
ln what sense can' t it get drastic ?
people keep falling in love with me .
i can believe it .
they get this strange idea .
i believe that too .
they ask me to marry them .
all the time .
i don' t know why they do it .
maybe it' s a kind of nervousness .
maybe .
i don' t wanna get married .
not yet , anyway .
that' d be worse than living at the club .
i' d have to get in by 1 again .
very true , you would .
at least occasionally .
that' s what' s wonderful about a married man .
no matter what , he can' t ask you to marry him .
he' s married already .
right ?
right .
you certainly don' t have to worry about me .
am i ever a married man !
i' m the most married man you' il ever know .
and i promise ... ... l will never ask you to marry me , come what may .
well , how about some music ?
fine .
let' s see what we' ve got here .
debussy , ravel , stravinsky .
hey , how about this one ?
rachmaninoff , the second piano concerto .
you look to me like a big rachmaninoff girl .
i do ?
funny , i don' t know anything about music .
you don' t have to .
just listen to it , that' s all .
this is classical music , isn' t it ?
i can tell .
there' s no vocal .
don' t talk .
don' t fight it .
relax .
go limp .
like this ?
yes .
let it sweep over you .
i got the biggest thing for eddie fisher .
frequently , people go to pieces listening to this .
no kidding ?
yes .
it quakes them .
it shakes them .
makes them goose pimply all over .
did you ever dunk a potato chip in champagne ?
it' s real crazy .
here .
lsn' t that crazy ?
yeah , pretty crazy .
we' d better send rachmaninoff off .
this wasn' t such a good idea .
don' t worry , everything' s fine .
a married man , air conditioning ... ... champagne and potato chips .
it' s a wonderful party .
hey !
look , you' ve got u. s. camera !
i do ?
how about that !
i' ve got u. s. camera .
i bought a dozen copies of this but people kept stealing them .
why would they do that ?
that' s me , right there on the beach .
my hair was a little longer then .
did you notice ?
no , i didn' t .
let me ask you something .
when they took this , there must' ve been some passersby .
other people around .
how did they keep the crowd back ?
it was taken early in the morning .
nobody was up .
except you see that shadow ?
ls it a sea gull ?
no , a coast guard helicopter .
he kept buzzing the beach .
maybe you' d like me to autograph this before i leave .
you' re not leaving yet , are you ?
how about more champagne ?
love some .
just freshen it .
oh , i' m awfully sorry .
here .
we should have some music .
do you play the piano ?
not really .
not anymore .
i used to .
just a little as a child .
go ahead , play something .
well , all right .
let' s see if i remember this .
it' s a little tricky .
chopsticks " !
i can play that too .
shove over .
i don' t know about that rachmaninoff , but this really gets me .
it does ?
and how .
i can feel the goose pimples .
goose pimples ?
don' t stop .
don' t stop .
why do you stop ?
you know why .
because now i' m going to take you in my arms and kiss you ... ... very quickly and very hard .
hey , wait a minute !
what happened ?
i lost track .
i don' t know .
this is terrible .
there' s nothing i can say .
except that i' m terribly sorry .
nothing like this ever happened to me before .
this happens to me all the time .
this is unforgivable .
the only possible excuse is that i' m not quite myself tonight .
maybe it' d be better if you would just go .
why ?
you' re being silly .
please go .
i must insist .
take your potato chips and go .
all right , if you really want me to .
good night .
good night .
i think you' re very nice .
nice !
you' re not nice .
you' re crazy , that' s what you are .
helen' s gone for one day and you' re running amuck .
smoking , drinking , picking up girls , playing " chopsticks .
you' re not gonna live through this summer .
not like this .
look at those bloodshot eyes .
look at that face , ravaged , dissipated , evil .
one morning you' il look in the mirror and that' s all .
the portrait of dorian gray .
good morning , mr. sherman .
good morning , miss morris .
mr. brady get in yet ?
yes , he came in early .
i wanna see him .
put this on my desk .
of course .
would you like me to get coffee and a doughnut ?
no , thank you .
have you had breakfast , with the family away ?
i' m capable of fixing my own breakfast .
i had a peanut butter sandwich and two whiskey sours .
mr. brady .
oh , sherman , come in .
well , what is it ?
i' ve been with this company for years , and i' ve never asked for a favor .
you had a raise in february .
i' m not talking about that .
this is more important than money .
i want two weeks off to join my wife and son in the country .
this is our busy season .
we' re preparing our fall list .
i' m very tense and upset .
i' m on the verge of a breakdown .
lf i could get back with my wife
how long have you been married ?
seven years .
ln a few years , you' il be delighted to get rid of them for the summer .
shipped them to nantucket yesterday afternoon ... ... and i haven' t been to bed since .
drank bourbon , smoked cigars , played poker till this morning .
came to the office .
never felt better in my life .
i may not go to bed at all till the family gets back in september .
lf i stay in new york alone ... ... there' s a chance i may not live to see september .
that' s ridiculous , sherman .
you' re just a little lonely .
what about us teaming up tonight , seeing if we can get lucky ?
it doesn' t have to be just poker .
we' il cut loose and have us a real hootenanny .
it' s very kind of you , but i don' t think no hootenannies .
suit yourself , but i' ve been thinking about that fall list .
what would you think of a 25 cent reprint ...
... of the portrait of dorian gray ?
dorian gray ?
look what we' il be giving them for a quarter !
vice , lust and corruption .
on the surface , clear eyed and healthy , just like you .
but underneath , dry rot .
the termites of sin and depravity , gnawing at his soul .
how does that strike you ?
no , no .
no .
the lnfidelity pattern in the married male ... ... or the ' seven year itch . '
a study of 18, 000 marriages conducted by myself ... ... leads us to believe that the ' urge curve ' in the husband ... ... rises sharply during the seventh year .
this phenomenon is humorously ... ... referred to as the seven year itch .
far from humorous , this unfortunate urge ... ... strikes 84 . 6 % / of the married male population ... ... rising to an alarming 91 . 8 % / during the summer months .
changed my mind .
gustaf meyerheim , the mad lover of leipzig .
an extreme , but not unusual case of the seven year itch ... ... occurred in leipzig , germany in 1912 .
gustaf meyerheim , happily married for seven years ... ... suddenly " seven years !
dr. brubaker to see mr. sherman .
doctor , you' re early .
yes , my 3 : 00 patient jumped out of the window .
so i' m ahead of schedule .
which door ?
this one .
good afternoon , mr. sherman .
dr. brubaker .
i see you' ve been working on my book .
it' s a wonderful book .
very important .
it has something for everyone .
yes .
you' il be happy to know that we' re giving it a big promotion .
you' il be seeing this in every drugstore in america .
" of sex and violence " ?
we had to soup up the title .
what does this represent ?
gustaf meyerheim , the mad lover of leipzig ... ... terrorizing one of his victims .
lsn' t that sensational ?
may i remind you that meyerheim was small , with a red beard ?
nobody knows that .
they know it in leipzig .
and all his victims were middle aged women .
don' t you think it' d be more effective ... ... to show a man terrorizing a young girl , sales wise ?
i' m not a salesman .
i' m a doctor .
i heal sick minds .
i find ways to root out insecurities , neuroses , inner tensions ....
what is it ?
what are you looking at ?
nothing .
does that mean something , doctor ?
no , nothing serious .
dark clouds on the psychic horizon .
that' s preposterous .
a twitch in a thumb , a nerve or a muscle .
you psychiatrists make a case out of it .
of all the ridiculous ....
are you very expensive ?
very .
i' m sure you make exceptions .
never .
lf a case really interests you ?
at $50 an hour , all my cases interest me .
lf you run into something spectacular , another gustaf meyerheim
you wouldn' t believe this , but last night ... ... l found myself terrorizing a young lady .
that could account for the thumb .
actually , it wasn' t that bad .
i just made a little boo boo .
psychoanalysis doesn' t recognize the boo boo as such .
everything is unconscious .
i was completely conscious .
i told her to take her potato chips and go .
potato chips . lf you please ....
all right , doctor .
i' m in serious trouble .
i' m married .
serious trouble .
married .
so far , normal .
i' ve been married for seven years .
i' m coming down with what you call the seven year itch .
what am i going to do ?
lf something itches , scratch .
i scratched .
there was this lady .
everything went black .
i terrorized her , i attempted to terrorize her .
the attempt was unsuccessful ?
definitely .
all i did was knock us both off the piano bench .
let me understand .
you attempted to terrorize ... ... a young lady on a piano bench ?
yes .
and on whose person was this attempt committed ?
here , doctor .
i brought this with me .
i didn' t wanna leave it lying around the house .
that' s her .
her hair was a little longer then .
it' s called " textures " because you can see three different textures .
it got honorable mention .
splendid .
i congratulate you on your good taste .
lnteresting driftwood formation too .
i' il give you my advice .
do not attempt it again .
but if you should , give yourself room to work in .
do not attempt it balanced on a piano bench .
such an attempt is doomed .
i love my wife .
don' t we all ?
your time is up .
lf you find yourself in need of further analysis , phone my office .
as for my book , we' il resume discussion as your ... has subsided .
lf she tells anybody about this , i' il kill her with my bare hands .
a possible solution .
but murder is the most difficult crime to commit .
until you can commit a simple act of terror ... ... l strongly advise you to avoid anything so complex .
one must learn to walk before one can run .
goodbye .
i' m in big trouble .
girls like this can' t keep their mouths shut .
this' il be all over new york .
i bet right this minute she' s telling someone about it .
he lured me in his apartment .
he made me sit on his piano bench .
he made me play " chopsticks .
then he turned on me .
he was frothing at the mouth ... ... just like the creature from the black lagoon !
i knew it .
i knew it !
that' s how these stories get started .
big blabbermouth .
then he lured her into his apartment ... ... pretended he wasn' t married .
he forced her onto the piano bench .
i know him very well .
he was in here for dinner , 260 calories .
he forced her to sit on the piano bench ... ... and then he made her play " chopsticks .
the word is spreading .
it' s spreading .
it' s like jungle drums .
everybody knows about it .
everybody' s talking about it .
television !
i forgot she' s on television .
50 million tv sets in america .
and now with the coaxial cable ... !
i had onions at lunch .
i had garlic dressing at dinner .
but he' il never know ... ... because i stay kissing sweet the new dazzledent way .
now that i have your attention , i want to warn all you girls ... ... about an evil , dangerous , married man ... ... living downstairs in my building .
his name is richard sherman .
s h e r m a n.
while his wife and son are in maine ... ... this monster is terrorizing the girls of new york .
mommy , come quick !
they' re talking about daddy .
he makes them sit on the piano bench ... ... and makes them play " chopsticks .
then suddenly he turns on them ... ... just like the creature from the black lagoon !
well , i might as well face it .
she knows everything .
she knows , she knows , she knows .
but maybe she doesn' t .
maybe there isn' t any tv up in maine .
i can' t go on like this .
why don' t i just call helen ?
the minute i heard her voice , i could tell if she knew anything .
all right , call her .
hello , long distance ?
i want ogunquit , maine .
ogunquit 42831 j. yeah , thanks .
what' s taking so long ?
maybe she' s talking to the lawyers already .
hello , hello ?
helen ?
bad connection .
who ?
who is this ?
i wanna talk to mrs. sherman .
who is this ?
oh , the babysitter .
look , this is mr. sherman .
where is mrs. sherman ?
what do you mean she' s on a hayride ?
with whom is she on a hayride ?
mr. mackenzie and some people ?
what people ?
she did leave a message ?
what was the message ?
ricky' s paddle .
no , i forgot .
something came up .
i' il send it first thing in the morning .
goodbye !
mr. sherman ?
what is it , miss morris ?
it' s after 6 .
do you need me anymore tonight ?
no .
we' ve come to the end of a perfect day .
let' s go home and enjoy the simple things .
the good things , the real things .
the laughter of a child .
a flight of swallows winging their way back home .
life can be beautiful , miss morris .
hey !
good evening .
i just washed my hair .
that' s nice .
goodbye .
oh , no , not tonight .
this girl' s a pistol .
got away with it once .
why press my luck ?
it' s gonna be quiet around here tonight .
i promise you that .
take a shower , poach an egg , rinse a shirt , hit the sack ... ... and that' s all .
lf she was washing her hair for me , is she kidding ?
helen , what a wife !
how lucky can you get ?
i' m glad she' s having a good time .
people to go out with , take her on hayrides .
one thing , though .
what' s she doing on a hayride with mackenzie ?
i wish she wouldn' t hang around people like that .
he' s capable of making a pass at her .
she' il probably like it .
she' s getting older .
i' m probably very dull .
and mackenzie is a writer .
a lousy writer .
that last book of his !
all that downwardly pulsating ... ... and hair spilled across the pillow .
no woman is safe around a guy who writes stuff like that .
no , tom , please .
the other people !
i have a confession to make .
look around .
there are no other people .
don' t be angry .
i should be .
no , tom .
what about the driver ?
there is no driver .
no driver ?
i thought of everything .
even the horses are wearing blinkers .
tom , i' m afraid .
afraid ?
of me ?
no , of me .
oh , darling !
downwardly , pulsating , striving .
now together , ending and unending .
now , now , now !
what a cornball .
okay , good luck .
lf that' s the way you wanna play it , i can play it that way too !
kaufman .
kaufman .
kaufman .
hi !
did you know you left your tomato plant down here last night ?
i' d be glad to bring it up .
maybe you' d like to have dinner .
then maybe we could go to an air conditioned movie .
didn' t you love the picture ?
i did .
but i just felt so sorry for the creature at the end .
sorry ?
what , did you want him to marry the girl ?
he was scary looking , but he wasn' t really all bad .
he just craved a little affection .
a sense of being loved and needed and wanted .
that' s an interesting point of view .
do you feel the breeze from the subway ?
lsn' t it delicious ?
sort of cools the ankles .
what would be fun to do now ?
it' s getting pretty late .
not that late .
i have this big day tomorrow .
i have to get to sleep .
what' s the big day ?
tomorrow i' m on tv .
i told you , the dazzledent hour .
oh , here comes another one .
tell me , dazzledent toothpaste , i don' t think i ever tried it .
you should .
it' s excellent .
oh , yes , i use it myself .
then you do recommend it ?
definitely .
it costs a little more , but 8 out of 10 oral hygienists
you sound like a commercial .
lf i believed commercials ....
you can believe this one .
what' s that you say ?
he' il never know .
i stay kissing sweet the new dazzledent way " ?
now really .
it' s true !
i' il prove it to you .
well ?
my faith in the integrity of advertising is restored .
however , before i switch brands , i wanna make absolutely certain .
a successful businessman like kaufman ... ... probably makes 15, 000 a year .
spends a fortune on sculptures but will not put in air conditioning .
i bet it was 95 in the bedroom last night .
poor kid , it' s awful .
good night .
lf you wanted to drop by my place to cool off ... ... before you face that turkish bath up there ....
i left the air conditioning on full blast .
it' s cold in there .
maybe for a few minutes .
to bring the body temperature down .
i feel no matter how much it costs ... ... if you' ve got to sell the kids ' bonds ... ... l say in the summertime in new york ... ... you' ve got to have air conditioning .
just feel that .
i didn' t tell you , but i have air conditioning in every room .
the kitchen , the bathroom , the bedroom .
heaven !
you just relax .
i' il fix two drinks , and we' il have a nice , quiet talk .
this is really the most !
well , what shall we talk about ?
how about psychoanalysis ?
i don' t know how much you know about it , but it' s a hobby of mine .
i like to wander through the labyrinth of the human mind .
what gets me is spending $3 . 95 for that miserable fan .
it' s absolutely useless .
i' il take it back to the store to get my money back .
just hope i didn' t lose the sales slip .
two days ago we were strangers ... ... and now you' re here alone with me .
how did it happen ?
why did we meet ?
the answer lies in the unconscious .
lf they won' t take back the fan , the larger size is only $3 more .
but what about tonight ?
i' ve just got to get some sleep .
you think that plant fell by itself ?
there are no accidents .
nothing happens by itself .
we make it happen .
you didn' t accidentally brush the plant , you pushed it .
maybe if i took the fan , put it in the icebox ... ... and left the door open ... ... then left the bedroom door open and soaked the sheets in ice water ....
no , that' s too icky .
your behavior is obvious .
you pushed the plant down to kill me .
and why do you suppose you wanted to ?
could it be , could it possibly be because you love me ?
of course i could simply ask him if i' m sure he wouldn' t mind .
he' s such a nice man .
nothing to be ashamed of .
under this veneer we' re all savages .
man , woman , hopelessly enmeshed .
we' re on a toboggan , we can' t stop .
it' s too late to run .
the beguine has begun .
what are we going to do ?
i' ve been thinking about it and i ....
yes ?
i' d like to stay here with you tonight .
i' d like to sleep here .
are you sure ?
that is , if you don' t mind .
it' s not a question of minding .
we don' t wanna rush into this .
there are savages , and savages .
this may be too savage .
lf you want to spend an hour here
don' t make me go to that hot apartment .
i haven' t slept in three nights .
i' d like to look good tomorrow .
i could sleep right here in this chair .
i' il be as quiet as a mouse .
you won' t know i' m around .
please ?
well , that' s different .
of course you can sleep here .
we' re not savages .
we' re civilized people .
thank you .
what time do you get up ?
about 8 , i guess .
i' il fix you breakfast .
fix my breakfast wait a minute .
suppose someone sees you leaving the apartment at 8 .
just one person sees you , and we' re dead .
all right then , i could get up at 6 and sneak upstairs .
get up at 6 and sneak sneak !
even worse .
suppose someone sees you sneaking out ?
we' re not doing anything wrong .
certainly , but there' s such a thing as society , laws , rules .
but after all , no man is an island .
who is it ?
it' s me , mr. kruhulik .
what is it ?
i was just coming home .
went out with a lady , the one with the big , fat poodle .
i saw your light .
i thought it might be a good time to pick up the rugs .
at 1 : 30 in the morning ?
are you out of your mind ?
i promised your wife .
those moths are probably right now chewing away big , gaping holes .
stop worrying .
i give you my word ... ... the moths are not eating anything .
come tomorrow , early , before they have their breakfast .
you can' t trust a moth , mr. sherman .
they get hungry at night ... ... so they start looking around for a snack and
oh , i wish i was dead .
what' s the matter ?
i' m sorry .
i didn' t quite understand the situation .
ln a situation like this , who cares about moths ?
situation , mr. kruhulik ?
what situation ?
moths ?
let them eat the rugs .
let them eat the curtains .
who cares ?
go , man , go .
i' d like to explain this .
this may seem unusual .
but it' s the most natural thing .
i' il say .
summertime , and the living is easy .
fish are jumping , cotton is high .
that' s enough !
the young lady lives in this building .
there' s been a terrible accident .
hi .
well , hello !
lsn' t she a living doll ?
this lady' s tomato plant fell down .
sorry to disappoint , but that' s all there is to it .
ln fact , i' m glad you dropped in .
you can help her take the plant upstairs .
it' s here .
i watered the garden with a cocktail shaker .
a little silver shaker .
you can see your insinuations are preposterous .
a natural mistake , mr. sherman .
and my apologies to you , dear lady .
what a doll !
right out here , mr. kruhulik .
what a shambles .
it' s all right .
we' re covered .
i have a policy .
thank you , mr. kruhulik , and good night .
good night , miss whatever your name is .
be careful , it' s heavy .
don' t strain anything .
i' m strained already ... ... from carrying that big , fat poodle around .
i wish i was dead !
well , good night .
good night .
i' m sorry .
but you can see how it is .
i understand .
no man is an island .
normal .
everything is absolutely normal .
sleep .
go to sleep .
how can i possibly sleep ?
what' il i do ?
helen .
write to helen .
write a long letter to helen .
paddle , that' s it .
i' ve got to send the paddle .
little ricky out there on the lake without a paddle .
wrap the paddle and send it off in the morning .
ricky needs it .
going to get his paddle .
how do you wrap a paddle , anyway ?
paper and string , what else ?
i need a piece of paper the shape of a paddle .
all right , nothing .
hey , there' s some gauze in the bathroom .
i can bandage the whole thing , put some tape on it and
and what , send it up in an ambulance ?
this is ridiculous .
people send paddles every day .
the mails are full of them .
how do they do it ?
that' s it , old newspapers !
big deal , old newspapers .
get a lot of string , slap it together ....
hi .
forgot about the stairs .
it was so easy .
i pulled out the nails .
you know what ?
we can do this all summer .
miss .
young lady .
i' ve got to take a shower .
got to get to the office .
please , lady , get up , go home so i can get to the office .
please , lady ?
no ?
poor kid , working in new york in this heat .
and on television !
standing there under those hot lights .
she must need money real bad .
lives in an expensive apartment .
i know what clothes cost .
buys imported champagne .
how can she possibly afford ?
she must have other sources of income .
plenty of ways a girl can get money if she' s unscrupulous enough .
she could get herself some foolish , well to do married man .
trap him into some situation .
bleed him till he' s white , squeeze him till he' s dry
they have a word for this .
they call it " blackmail .
where is she ?
she' s with kruhulik .
they' re down at the bank going through my safe deposit box .
hello , are you in there ?
hi , good morning !
just taking a shower .
be out in a minute .
taking a shower , she' il be out in a minute , that' s all .
i should get one of the new towels and take it to her .
that would very definitely be another boo boo .
lf anyone were to walk in , would they ever get the wrong idea .
cinnamon toast for two , strange blond in the shower .
explain that .
tell them you spent the night wrapping a paddle .
anybody walk in here !
who' s gonna walk in here ?
j. edgar hoover ?
arthur godfrey ?
helen , maybe ?
she' s in maine .
how could she get here ?
on the train , that' s how .
on the early morning train .
why would she be coming to new york ?
because she knows something .
because someone tipped her off .
who could' ve tipped ?
kruhulik !
he saw the girl here last night ... ... called helen long distance and told her everything .
she' s on the train , i know it .
early morning train' s in already .
she' s in a cab .
she' s on her way here .
she' il be here any second !
there' s a woman in this apartment .
i know there is .
no , helen , it' s not true .
don' t lie to me , richard .
who told you ?
was it kruhulik ?
that' s right .
i' ve had him watching you for months .
his name' s not kruhulik .
he' s a private eye named johnny dollar .
what are you going to do ?
i' m going to shoot you .
i can explain everything .
the cinnamon toast , the shower .
this girl' s from denver .
the kaufmans have no air conditioning .
spend a fortune on sculpture .
the drugstore wouldn' t take back her fan , she lost the slip .
so i let her sleep in our bed .
i was just wrapping the paddle .
at least have the decency to keep the paddle of a child ... ... out of this sordid mess .
you' re mad .
you' il never get away with this .
yes , i will .
there' s such a thing as the unwritten law .
goodbye , richard .
give me another chance !
they' il give me a medal .
the wives of america will give me a medal !
helen , i' m going fast .
give me a cigarette .
a cigarette !
you know what dr. murphy told you about smoking .
a cigarette .
just one more cigarette , dr. murphy .
one more for the road .
for the long , long road .
hi .
what are you doing ?
i need a cigarette .
they' re right there on the table .
what' s the matter with you ?
i' m all shot .
it' s because i took your bed and you slept on the couch .
i knew i should' ve taken the couch .
it' s not the couch , it' s my wife .
she found out about us and shot me .
she what ?
five times in the back and twice in the belly .
you' re just having a bad dream .
yeah , i guess so .
come on now .
everything' s fine .
it' s just my imagination .
some people have flat feet .
i have this appalling imagination .
i think it' s just elegant .
i just have no imagination at all .
i have lots of other things .
i was standing in the kitchen .
then it occurred to me .
lf my wife walked in with you in the shower , she' d probably shoot me .
of course . lf i was married ... ... and came in on my husband making toast for a blond , i' d shoot him .
you would ?
bang , bang , bang !
right in the head .
come on now , relax .
you' re just making this all up .
that' s right .
i don' t suppose if she had come in she' d shoot me .
she' d be mad , maybe throw an ashtray .
just that ?
she probably wouldn' t even do that .
lf she found you in the shower ... ... she' d probably think you were the plumber .
a blond plumber ?
absolutely .
she trusts me implicitly .
doesn' t she love you ?
oh , she loves me .
she worries about me .
i had a cough , and she made me stop smoking .
she loves me , all right .
lsn' t she jealous ?
not really .
how can anybody be jealous of somebody with a briefcase ... ... who' s getting a little pot and can' t keep his eyes open past 9 ?
she trusts me .
it' d never occur to her that l
last christmas , i came home with lipstick on my collar .
helen said , " what' s that on your collar , cranberry sauce ?
that' s bad .
you know who kissed me ?
mrs. brady .
face it , no pretty girl wants me , she wants gregory peck .
ls that so ?
how do you know what a pretty girl wants ?
i don' t know , but i imagine
your imagination !
you think every girl' s a dope .
you think a girl goes to a party and there' s some guy ... ... in a fancy striped vest strutting around ... ... giving you that i' m so handsome you can' t resist me look .
from this she' s supposed to fall flat on her face .
well , she doesn' t fall on her face .
but there' s another guy in the room , over in the corner .
maybe he' s nervous and shy and perspiring a little .
first , you look past him .
but then you sense that he' s gentle and kind and worried .
that he' il be tender with you , nice and sweet .
that' s what' s really exciting .
lf i were your wife , i' d be very jealous of you .
i' d be very , very jealous .
i think you' re just elegant .
thank you .
aren' t you going to answer it ?
answer what ?
the doorbell .
go ahead , i' il put the cinnamon on the toast .
tom mackenzie !
morning , dickie boy .
what are you doing here ?
don' t call me " dickie boy .
got a date with my agent .
ls that coffee i smell ?
no .
i' m glad i caught you .
we' ve got important family business to discuss .
are you sure that' s not coffee ?
positive .
my family ?
i was driving down and helen asked me to stop by and ask you
she did ?
i' m glad she did ... ... because i wanna talk to you .
what' s the matter , dickie boy ?
you think you' re pretty fancy with the blinkers on the horses .
what blinkers ?
what horses ?
and no driver and no other people .
you drunk or something ?
