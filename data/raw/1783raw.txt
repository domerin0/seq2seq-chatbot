you ever stare at the ceiling till it started looking kind of funny ?
like it was breathing .
like it was saying something .
like it was saying , " rocky , you gotta do something about what' s been going on .
something' s gotta happen , sam .
something' s gotta give .
we can call the police .
police wouldn' t do jack .
i wish i was bigger .
i' m bigger .
not to mention the fact that i' m smarter .
if you do something , he' il just get you .
did you ever used to get me when we used to play hide and seek ?
no .
he wouldn' t have any better luck .
wanna know my secret hiding spot ?
the roof .
the disappearing man .
exactly .
so high .
oh , my god .
rocky' s thinking about doing something to george .
i don' t get how the teachers can just let him get away with that .
teachers don' t care .
they have him in detention for 15 minutes for a week .
something' s gotta give .
if you could snap your fingers right now , and he would drop dead in his tracks , would you do it ?
are we still on for saturday ?
yeah , of course .
so , what are we gonna do ?
i' il figure something out , and i' il surprise you .
hey , you know that fat kid , george , who they keep holding back from graduating middle school ?
yeah , i hate that guy .
he beat up sam .
no .
hey , you know when we were at rollins , that crazy kid chased me across the field and cracked my head open with a bat .
finally , an explanation .
yeah , anyway ...
he' s a real pig .
i say we smoke that ham .
yeah ?

pork chop ify him .
spam icize him .
link sausage ize him !
squeal , piggy !
squeal !
no , screw that guy .
you' d really like to do that , wouldn' t you , clyde ?
you' re projecting , marty .
projecting ?
that' s when you say something that someone else ...
you say that they want to do , when you' re the one who wants to do it .
no , no , no .
that' s good .
that' s good .
hold up , rocky .
back up .
i got something for you .

oh , you son of a bitch !
i was just projecting .
oh , you asshole !

i' m chewing the whole pack .
why , you want some ?
tasty .
ok ,
jennifer lopez or the girl who sits behind you in school ?
j. lo .
ok , i think i got one .
tie him to a tree , pour some honey on his face , and leave him there all day and night .
why ?
it' s for the bugs , so they' d get on him and bite him .
no , we can' t do that .
why not ?
well , what if a bear came ?
shut up .
you know , if we hurt him , we' d be just as bad as him .
so we need to hurt him without really hurting him .
i mean , if you could think of something like that , then ...
then what ?
i don' t know .
all right , heather locklear or shannen doherty ?
don' t know who heather locklear is .
you don' t ... ?
dude !
so , what do you say ?
i think it' s a totally wild plan .
it' s also the only plan my brother would agree to .
he' s just a little fucking gandhi , isn' t he ?
like a fucking white martin luther king .
all we need now is a boat .
hey , my neighbor' s got a boat in her back yard that she never uses .
does that mean you' re in ?
do you actually think he' il go for it ?
oh , please .
george' il get a hard on as soon as he picks up the phone .
rock will throw on some of that " sweet boy " charm of his .
kid' s desperate .
stupid .
it' s human nature .
all i know is , is i' m getting a hard on just thinking about it .
your mom don' t need the car saturday , does she ?
the only thing my mom needs on saturdays is valium .
what do you think , clyde ?
do we want to give georgie porgie a little taste of his own medicine ?
huh ?
be some good , clean fun , don' t you think ?
yeah , he deserves it , doesn' t he ?
if there' s one thing that can' t be argued , it' s that that fat freak deserves whatever he' s got coming to him .
dude , what' d i tell you ?
you don' t smoke herb .
yeah , so get it out of my face .
faggot .
clyde o ,
i' m just fucking with you .

we' re going boating .
we' re going on a boating trip .
you like boating ?

because we didn' t really invite a lot of people , and ...
and , you know , everyone knows everybody in this town .
and you tell your parents , parents will tell other parents , and those parents will tell their kids .
and pretty soon everyone who didn' t get invited will be sitting at home , crying .

this is the inside of my mind .
this is my mother .
my mom works out every day .
and this is my street .

it' s very sweet of you , george .
i got it at funco .
you can return it if you want .
oh , no , it' s perfect .
well ... ... it' s a beautiful day for a boat trip with some buddies .
hey , marty ?
my mom made me sign one of those contracts .
it' s just , like ...
you know , i' m not allowed to get in a car with a driver
who' s been drinking .
oh , it' s cool .
my mom gave me permission to drink and drive .
you don' t have to worry about it .
your mom must be pretty stupid to give you permission to drive inebriated .
no , you' re right , george .
my mom is pretty stupid .
in fact , she' s got one of those learning disability things .
must be a bad ld .
i have an ld , but i should know you' re not supposed to drive drunk .
i see stuff all backwards and shit .
like , instead of seeing " stop " on a stop sign ,
i see " pots .
my doctor says it' s a genetic variation , like for evolution .
so maybe i' m a superior being .
the future of the race .
like , if aliens came down and they had a ...
a language , a super advanced language , that said you had to read this way to that way , instead of that way to this way .
shit .
yo , kidlings .
what are you guys doing here ?
eating mini beef tacos .
finest mini beef tacos in the world here .
yummy .
what , did you steal mom' s car again ?
why do you care ?
i don' t give a fuck .
who' s the minors ?
it' s just my brother and some of his friends .
what are the paddles for ?
we' re going cow spanking .
cow spanking , what' s that ?
it' s like cow tipping , only we spank .
really .
come on , let' s just get the smokes and get out of here .
camels .
while you boys are out cow spanking ,
kile and i are gonna go pussy hunting .
good for you , jasper .
hey , don' t get sassy with my boy .
you ever been pussy hunting ?
no , i didn' t think so .
you know how i knew ?
because you gotta have some bait to catch one .
that' s great .
grow up , jasper .
let' s go , marty .
jesus , jasper .
why do you have to ... ?
dumb fucks .
why do you have to act so retarded ?
have fun cow spanking , boys .
oh , man .
that was awesome .
you see that shit ?
so whose road is this ?
it' s just a road .
hey , you guys ever hear about when rocky and i were kicking it out here ?
we got some poison oak on our hands .
this is a disgusting story .
anyway , so we were out here , and we got some poison oak on our hands .
with all the beers we were drinking , well , naturally , we had to take a piss .
now , i don' t know if you' re hip , millie , but when a guy pisses , he has to hold his pisser in his hands .
thanks , marty .
no , wait , i' m not finished yet .
next morning when we woke up , we both had totally chapped , rash y nuts .
hey , lucky you didn' t run out of toilet paper , have to wipe your butt with your hand .
ouch , ouch !
i just got stung by something .
you all right ?
yeah .
you guys just go ahead .
better make sure it' s not a tick .
lyme' s disease , you know .
look , all right , there' il be three circles around the bite if it' s lyme' s disease .
but , like , you gotta watch out because you could just straight drop dead from lyme' s disease .
thanks , george .
oh , if it is a tick and it gets dug in , we might need to take my tweezers and , like , put it under a flame until it gets , like , red hot , and then burn the thing to death so it' il let go before we pull it out .
can you leave us alone for a second ?
thanks .
seems like george is having a good time .
what are you trying to say , clyde ?
fat boy' s gonna get what he' s got coming .
i don' t see a stinger .
sam , what' s going on here with george ?
oh , it' s nothing bad .
it' s just a joke .
what kind of joke ?
well ... ... we' re planning on stripping him , throwing him in the river , and then we' re gonna make him run home naked .
we have a plan .
it involves a dare .
a dare ?
yeah .
see , the only reason i didn' t tell you before ...
who said i wanted to be part of this ?
all right , what about this ?
what' s that ?
if you could snap your fingers right now ,
and he would drop dead in his tracks , would you do it ?
it' s totally mean , sam .
he' s mean .
he' s a stupid fat kid .
he' s got problems .
but he' s obviously ...
promise me you won' t do anything to him .
it' s not just me .
promise , or i go back to the car .
all right , i promise .
i' il tell rocky .
can' t wait to get her on the river and start paddling .
hey , rock , you wanna go untie us ?
sure .
there any life jackets ?
no , i don' t think we' il need them .
come on , sweetheart .
gotta learn to live life on the edge .
he doesn' t smoke , marty .
why don' t you speak for yourself , faggot ?
i gotta keep my eye on you .
these are really strong .
come on , rock , he' s not such a bad guy .
he' s acting like a nice guy , sam .
in reality , he' s not .
you a ...
you a cigarette virgin , george ?
no .
no , i' m not , man .
i' ve smoked before .
i ...
no , i once cold smoked an entire pack of american spirit menthols .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
what if i told you american spirit doesn' t make menthols ?
they don' t ?
it' s ok if you' ve never smoked before , george .
i never have .
well , i have .
all right , i' m not lying .
you know , maybe they weren' t menthols , but they were definitely
american spirits .
right .
the only reason why he' s being nice to us is because he sees this as an opportunity to get something .
to get friends .
everybody wants that .
ok , what if you were his friend , sam ?
i mean , he' d still go around school , beating everybody else up .
and that' s actually if you' d be his friend .
i don' t care what you say .
i don' t wanna do it .
millie thinks it' s a bad idea too .
oh , well , if millie thinks ...
millie thinks what' s a bad idea ?
nothing .
you pansies untie the knot yet ?
chop , chop , come on .
hey .
hey , rock , you know , i got a knife that' il slice through that like butter .
that' s ok , george .
i think we got it .
well , it' s got , like , a bone saw , scissor , pick ax , i mean , everything .
it' s ok , george .
ok .
i' il talk to marty about it , ok ?
give me your oar .
nice .
thank you , george .
yeah , i once skipped a rock on this lake , it skipped , like , a thousand times .
let' s get her in the water .
aye , aye , capitan .
calling off the plan .
i' il tell you later .
it' s all taken care of .
hey !
you guys should take your shoes off if you don' t want to get them wet .
too late .
they' re soaked .
this is gonna be fun , don' t you think ?
yeah .
but whoever didn' t bring life jackets on a boat trip' s a moron .
hey , you know i have athlete' s foot ?
get in .
you are so disgusting .
oh , my gosh .
row , two , three , four !
one , two , three , four ...
sam loves it , don' t you lie
rocky is a pimp
clyde is a fag
yeah , you love it , don' t you ?
he spit all over the lens .
shut up , rocky , this is what' s gonna get me on mtv .
you need go go dancers .
this is expensive .
ok , now you have to stop .
send your donations to george tooney , oregon .
love one .
i always thought i was really talented in that sense .
you agree , right ?
up top .
maybe later .
i' m glad the way this day' s turning out .
it' s a nice day .
yeah , if nothing else , it' s a nice day .
can you guys taste how sweet the air is ?
smells like cherry blossom .
how do you know what cherry blossoms smell like , george ?
it' s obvious .
i don' t know .
what is a cherry blossom ?
it' s the blossom on a cherry .
no , i thought it was its own kind of plant .
what do you think , marty ?
i think i' m bored as fuck .
i also think i got some more beer in my pack .
anyone want one ?
yeah .
you drinking , sammy ?
yeah , sure .
i thought you ...
didn' t you want a beer ?
hey , sammy .
if you' re really feeling like a party animal ... ... you wanna smoke a birthday doobie ?
sam doesn' t smoke weed , marty .
rocky , chill out .
there' s younger people
on this trip , marty .
all right , fuck face , calm down .
i' ve been stoned before .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
yeah .
i smoked a whole blunt myself once .
yup .
i ...
i hallucinated that there was ...
there was a little blue guy on my shoulder , fucking tap dancing .
but , no , i don' t smoke weed after that , because , like , my doctor says it stunts your growth .
so i' m waiting until i' m 24 .
yeah .
because , you know , that' s when you stop growing .
have you ever been stoned , millie ?
would you please get that out of my face ?
all right , go ahead , turn it off .
sure is a beautiful river .
oh , you guys , look !
what ?
what ?
what ?
i thought i saw a water snake .
sam .
millie .
thanks .
here .
thanks .
all that boating really gets your appetite up .
you' ve just been sitting in the boat .
i' ve been shifting my weight the whole time , trying to keep us level .
yeah , you' ve really been working hard .
as if your pussy ass has been doing anything .
did you make these yourself ?
you' il ...
you' il have to give me the recipe sometime .
it' s peanut butter and jelly .
oh , yeah .
nothing beats a good piss in the river .
except , of course , a good romping session of a stupid , ugly , dumb , pathetic piece of shit .
yeah , we gotta talk about that .
yeah ?
what' s to talk about ?
i want to call it off .
i' m not laughing .
i' m dead serious .
wait a minute .
first , you get me all juiced up .
you make me steal my mom' s car .
you get me out here on a saturday when i could be at home watching tv .
marty , come on .
then you have me steering the fucking titanic all across the river with a bunch of munchkins who are totally sober and bringing me down .
now , you mean to tell me we don' t even get to do what we came out here for ?
i had no idea the guy was gonna turn out so nice .
check it out , rock , he' s not nice !
he' s a spoiled , retarded punk who beat up your brother .
ok , maybe i feel a little sorry for him now .
you' re either hard as hell and you' re yanking my chain , or you' re the limpest dick i' ve ever met in my life .
everyone wants to call it off .
well , everyone is a vagina !
you don' t even have a real grudge against him .
if you were any kind of a good brother , you wouldn' t let sammy boy get the shit kicked out of him and then stroke the beater upper' s dick all day long .
just remember the plan' s off .
yeah .
i just wonder if , when push came to shove , if you' d have my back .
hey , clyde .
remember when you were in the fourth grade , and i was in third , and i ...
i smacked you across the face with a bat ?
how could i forget ?
maybe you had that thing where you forget from getting hit in the head .
amnesia ?
yeah .
anyway , i was trying to remember .
why' d i do it ?
i don' t know .
you must' ve done something .
no , i never do anything to anybody .
that' s stupid .
of course you do .
look , it' s not stupid , george .
you just attacked me .
a kid doesn' t just attack for no reason .
you always attack for no reason .
i know it' s your birthday , sam , but shut your trap .
hey !
you pussies done with your sammies ?
does it look like we' re done with our sandwiches ?
yeah , i' m gonna get the boat back in the water .
you ladies can join me whenever you want .
why' d you drop the anchor ?
because i felt like it .
hey , sammy .
what you say we bust out that stream machine .
yeah , ok .
clyde , can you give it to me ?
all right .
put that away .
all right , first , we must charge the propulsion system .
and then take aim and run a preliminary test .
fire !
fire !
fire !
fire !
don' t fucking squirt that thing at me again !
hey , what do you guys say we play some truth or dare ?
yeah .
yeah , i love that game .
ok , then , let' s do it .
let' s not .
people' s feelings always end up hurt when we play this game .
yeah , she' s right .
god , sam and millie are a couple of little wet pussies , aren' t they ?
clyde , do you wanna start ?
i don' t know .
i' m kind of with millie and sam on this one .

ok , then .
rocky , truth or dare ?

all right , i want you to tell us , in 20 words or more , what you were thinking the last time you beat off .
susie johnson .
but that' s ...
that' s not even 20 words .
it' s , like , two .
ok , i imagined that she followed me into the locker room , went into the stall .
she got on her knees .
i sat on the toilet .
that' s 20 .

that' s gross .
sammy , go .

maybe we should call him " lover boy .
ok , then .
marty .

i dare you to pull down your pants and your underwear , and show us that famous dick of yours for at least ten seconds .
ten seconds .

because you know what ?
i didn' t even pick dare , all right ?
i pick truth .
you want a truth ?
ok , i' il give you a truth .
the truth is , lard fart , is that we didn' t invite you out here because we' ve been secretly in love
with you all these years .
marty , don' t do this .
we invited you out here because you smacked sammy boy
right there in the cranium .
marty , stop .
so we came up with a plan to mess you up .
is that true , sam ?
yeah .
but then we changed our minds because we liked you .
wait , you ... ?
you tricked me ?
yes , we tricked you .
and , yes , all these suckers here changed their minds , but i didn' t change mine .
i' m a man who likes to follow through with his plans .
what have you been planning ?
we were planning on stripping you , throwing you in the river , then making you run home naked .

we can never be forgiven for what we did .
you didn' t do anything .
i don' t wanna be here .
i don' t wanna be here .
i wanted to kill him before i threw him over .
now he' s dead .
maybe this was his time to go .
maybe it was his fate .
why would it be his fate ?
because everything happens for a reason , rock .
i don' t know .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
anybody know what time it is ?
what if we say we were playing truth or dare , and then we dared him to jump into the river , and he did , and he drowned .
what the hell are you doing ?
looking for his fucking video camera .
if it gets found , then everybody finds out what we did .
everyone' s gonna find out what we did , regardless if the video camera gets found , marty .
not if we don' t want them to .
are you joking ?
look , this was a prank that went wrong .
we come completely clean .
no one' s got a ton of sympathy for guys who throw fat kids in the river .
all right ?
if we turn ourselves in , we' re all screwed .
what do you think' s gonna happen , marty ?
superman' s gonna fly around earth and turn back time ?
no .
i don' t think superman' s going to turn back time .
think we gotta bury the body .
rocky , if we bury the body , it' s gonna look like we did it on purpose .
if we bury the body , we' re not gonna look like anything .
out of sight , out of mind .
yeah , well , maybe out of your mind , you stupid fuck .
look , we just committed a major fucking crime .
and if any one of us cracks , we are all gonna be screwed .
look , it was an accident .
kids like us have accidents all the time .
this wasn' t just an accident .
all right ?
we schemed this , from the beginning .
all right , so fine , we schemed .
no one has to know that .
they' re gonna figure it out .
somebody' s bound to crack when they start asking a million questions .
put sammy boy in a lie detector .
look , the idea of burying the body is nuts .
going to jail and getting raped every night for the rest of your cute , little , fucking lives is nuts .
i think you' re nuts .
so that' s it ?
we' re just gonna pretend like we' re all innocent .
shut up .
no .
shut up .
no !
if you' ve got a better idea , then you better spit it out
because no one else does .
marty , come on .
do you have one ?
shit , marty .
get off .
come on .
if you' ve got a better idea , i' il listen .
do you ?
no .
then do you agree that we have to go with the best idea we' ve got ?
yes .
get off .
you always gotta go with the best idea you' ve got .
otherwise you' re just left
laying around not knowing what to do .
i can' t do it .
it' s not safe .
it' s a big joke anyway .
i think that' s deep enough .
hey , you guys wanna help ?
first thing we gotta do when we get back is deal with jasper and my brother .
how ?
gotta make sure they forget they ever saw george with us .
what the fuck you gonna do ?
huh ?
hit them over the head with a rock , hope they get amnesia ?
thanks .
all right , this is the way it' s gonna work .
we drop everybody off at their houses .
everybody' s gonna sit tight until i go make sure everything' s " copathetic " with kile and jasper .
the word' s copacetic , marty .
yeah .
millie ... ... mum' s the word .
peg , can i get the phone ?
shit .
kile ?
hey , marty .
what' s cooking ?
hey , you little fucker .
how' d the cow spanking go ?
what ?
looks fantastic .
you ok ?
you look a little ...
no , i' m fine .
clyde , if something' s up , it' s ok to tell us about it .
this is so fucked .
fuck !
i don' t even know ...
i don' t even know .
hey .
maybe you guys could take me home ?
wish we knew what to do .
we know what to do .
you know what we did , rocky .
what are you trying to say , sam ?
you have to trust me on this one , sam .
i' m your big brother .
but i don' t trust you .
where you going ?
what do you want ?
to talk .
we have nothing to talk about .
it was your guys ' plan .
i was just there .
that doesn' t mean i have to tell on you .
and that' s your problem .
are you done ?
can i come in ?
do you remember when you said we could never be forgiven ?
that might be right .
i don' t know .
the only thing i do know is that i' m not sure about anything .
what do you want us to do ?
go back and unbury the body ?
he' s dead .
you know ... ... when we graduate high school and go to college and become doctors and lawyers and all that ...
... what do you think it' d be like ?
hey .
hey , marty .
good to see you .
how you doing , mr. maris ?
how are you ?
i' m good .
are ... ?
is rocky and sam home ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
the whole gang' s here .
they' re listening to music in the bedroom there .
do you mind if ... ?
thanks .
yeah , yeah .
what' s going on here ?
why don' t you sit down ?
what , so i go off to make sure all our business is taken care of , and all of a sudden you guys form a new club ?
we' ve come to a decision .
you' ve come to a decision ?
what , are you kidding me ?
we already decided .
i talked to jasper and kile .
they' re not gonna say anything .
everything is going to be ok .
no .
everything is not gonna be ok .
so , what ?
all you guys decide to squeal or something ?
we have to , marty .
it' s the only way ...
no , there is no " only way " , sam .
that' s crap .
ok ?
you know that' s crap .
all right .
screw all of you , then .
marty , hang on .
no !
where you going ?
away from you .
you suck .
you know that , right ?
what are you gonna do ?
i don' t know , drive to mexico .
what do you think ?
i don' t know what to think .
well , if you don' t know what to think , then you probably shouldn' t be making decisions .
what do you think about letting me borrow your gun ?
hey .
yeah .
easy , man .
he was saying terrible things .
things that shouldn' t have been said .
when your brother knocked george overboard ... ... would you say he was in control or out of control ?
you got something for me ?
yeah .
excuse me , sam .
never seen him more out of control in my life .
my name is george .
and this ... ... is the inside of my mind .
the inside of my mind has a zillion things .
the inside of my mind has a zillion things about it .
but ... ... people that don' t see inside my mind don' t know there are a zillion things and ...
you know , since no one sees inside my mind , no one really knows .
but ... ... one day people will know .
one day people will know because that' s my master plan .
to film it all .
to document every aspect of the life that is me .
and put it in a time capsule in my back yard .
and so that one day , some ... ... alien , or some highly evolved species , will find it and ...
understand .
