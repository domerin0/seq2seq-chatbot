will you be ready soon ?
half an hour .
hair ?
5 minutes
look .
we must show this .
no .
it' s too ugly .
i' m telling you , it' s super important .
i can' t shoot this crap .
romain , let me introduce you .
one last light check .
come on in .
good morning , doctor .
please sit down .
how are you feeling ?
how did the tests go ?
a bit painful , but i was expecting worse .
feeling better now .
good .
i asked you to drop by because i got your results ,
and i must say they' re not very good .
i got aids ?
no , ... nothing to do with aids .
you have a tumor .
a malignant one .
cancer ?
a kind of cancer , yes .
that' s the lesions to my liver and lungs ?
yes .
same cause .
what does that mean ?
has the cancer spread ?
yes .
we' il do everything to cure you .
i will not lie to you .
there' s a high risk ... ... that the tumor will resist treatment , and keep growing instead .
can' t it be taken out ?
no .
as i told you , the tumor is spreading in multiple organs .
it' s inoperable
what' s more , the tests have not identified the point of origin .
what about treatment ?
drugs , radiotherapy
drugs , as in chemotherapy ?
yes .
out of the question .
a friend of my parents ' died from cancer 2 years ago .
he had chemo , lost his hair , stopped eating , suffered horribly ...
do not compare .
each cancer , each chemotherapy is different .
what are my chances for remission ?
there' s a slight chance , but it exists .
you are 31 .
you will fight .
' slight ' , does that mean 50 % or 5 % odds ?
5 % , right ?
yes , roughly .
even less than 5 % ?
unfortunately .
yes .
without treatment , how long do i have ?
difficult to answer .
we' re talking averages here .
in similar cases , 3 months .
but it could be 1 month .
or 1 year .
i don' t see the point of heavy stuff like chemo .
it won' t work anyway .
i do not judge you .
you are young ; i would rather you fight .
even if your chances are small , they are not nil .
you should grab even a single chance .
but it' s your decision , and i shall respect it .
you fly to tokyo on the 15th , you land in the morning .
you shoot the 2pm vogue swimsuit issue the very same day .
you take the evening train for kyoto .
romain , are you listening ?
yes .
you sure you want to go ?
of course .
why do you ask ?
i don' t know .
lately i find you strange .
it' s like nothing interests you .
of course not .
don' t worry .
maybe you should take some time off , we cancel the shoots , ... ... and you come back in great shape .
you' ve been telling me how this is great for my career ,
that the financial stakes are high .
not if you mess the shoots up !
do you think i' m capable of that ?
sometimes it is best to turn down offers , so as not to disappoint .
you already approached someone else ?
no ...
i told jean baptiste .
he' d agree to go , just in case ...
tell him to get fucked .
i' m going to japan .
well , i want to tell you i love you .
i' m very ill and will die soon .
romain . food' s ready !
i' m coming .
why do you lock up ?
last time you used to always let me in .
these days are over .
i want to ask you something .
what , this time ?
be nice to your sister .
you know she and alain are not doing great .
ok .
don' t worry .
i know it' s not my business , and i don' t want to meddle ,
it hurts your sister that you don' t show an interest in her .
you never call her , you don' t talk to her ...
you already told me , you keep repeating yourself !
then make an effort , that' s all .
ok .
thank you .
see how much he' s grown ?
he' s truly adorable .
amazing how much he looks like you !
like whom ?
romain .
same nose .
don' t you feel like having one too ?
stop it mum , please ...
you already have 2 grandchildren .
isn' t that enough ?
you know your mother , strong maternal instinct .
i only say this because i know ... ... romain always liked children .
isn' t that true darling ?
too bad your son is a fag , no offsprings from me .
romain , in a few years ... ... i' m sure adoption will be possible , whatever your sexual orientation .
shall we eat ?
i' m starving .
we' re signing next week ; hope it works out !
you' re very well prepared .
i know but i' m stressed out .
i know the guy is very difficult to convince .
i' m not worried for you .
and you , romain , what' s up ?
nothing in particular .
everything ok , work wise ?
yes , it' s ok .
japan is canceled ?
yes , not too interesting , and lots of work in paris right now .
such a shame ...
i would have loved going there ...
you were not invited .
that' s what is sad .
i don' t have your talent .
do you realize we have a photographer in the family , and he' s never shot a picture of my kids .
that' s true , and i' d love for you to take a portrait of your dad and myself ...
just like in the english magazine you showed us .
that would be fun .
don' t waste your breath , he' s not interested , we' re not fashionable enough for him .
he prefers actresses and top models .
don' t say that sophie , there was no opportunity , otherwise i' m sure romain would have done something .
no .
she' s right
why do you say that ?
i don' t feel like taking her kids ' picture .
romain , please .
leave it , dad .
you want to know why i don' t feel like it ? they are your things , they belong to you .
i would have seen your face in them .
just thinking about it i feel like puking .
romain . stop it !
not surprising your man left you , i understand him .
you give him no space , feels like you made the kids on your own .
sophie !
stop it .
romain , you stop it too .
she' s mad !
that' s too much , romain !
why do you talk to her that way ?
she' s not well , she' s fragile .
i' m fragile too
what' s wrong with you ?
drive me home please ; i' m drunk .
i broke my spectacles . it' s ok , calm down ...
are things ok with sacha ?
normally , neither good nor bad .
we' re gonna split .
shit !
why ?
like all couples , passion dies , routine takes over ...
does he still live with you ?
he' s out of work , no money .
if he needs a place , tell him about your aunt' s spare room .
it will be cheap .
ok , thanks .
what is it you bought ?
nothing .
just a bit of coke .
i thought you stopped taking that shit !
it' s just once in a while .
helps me get a hard on .
good night
you know , romain ...
what ?
don' t do anything foolish .
your mum cannot take it .
how about you ?
i cannot either .
why do you always talk about mum , her reactions , as if nothing can hurt you ?
i don' t know .
a habit .
pity , isn' t it ?
maybe i never learnt to talk about myself .
there' s something i always wanted to ask you ...
yeah ?
why didn' t you and mum get a divorce ?
because we always loved each other .
but you cheated on her ...
a few times .
so what ?
i don' t know .
one night when i was a kid , i woke up and spied on one of your conversations in the kitchen .
mum had found a letter from a woman .
she was crying .
you were not consoling her .
i always thought you would separate .
see ?
we' re still together .
do you regret it ?
of course not .
why would i ?
is it because of sacha you' re telling me all this ?
yeah , maybe .
do i scare you ?
sometimes .
good night , son .
hi !
still playing that crap ?
you' re not 12 anymore .
where were you ?
at my parents ' place .
was it good ?
yeah .
the usual .
you don' t love me anymore , right ?
i don' t know .
i don' t love you either .
what game are you playing ?
i' m not playing .
i' m telling you the truth .
i don' t feel anything .
just a bit of lust .
some tenderness at times .
why do you tell me that now ?
it' s nice to tell the truth , no ?
don' t tell me it' s painful .
i won' t believe you .
do you want us to stop ?
do you want me to leave ?
yes .
where will i go ?
what will i do ?
i don' t care , just beat it .
what' s wrong ?
you never spoke to me that way .
i' m fed up with this shit situation .
you do nothing .
you live off me .
who do you think you are ?
you think you are better , with your shit photos , your self importance ?
at least i don' t need you to live on .
take your stuff and clear out !
you' re the strongest .
happy ?
now kill me .
one of these days ...
sorry .
sorry .
are you finished ?
yes .
thanks .
few clients today .
business is slow .
you work here everyday ?
yes , five days a week .
tomorrow is the week end .
i can rest .
good .
are you going back home ?
no , going to visit my grandmother .
is she ill ?
no , she' s in great health .
you' right , often if we visit our grandmother , that' s because she' s about to die .
for me it' s just to tell her i love her .
that' s nice .
no .
i' m not a nice person .
do you have children ?
beg your pardon ?
just making conversation .
no .
no children .
single , no kids ?
that' s right .
miss !
yes .
sorry .
you should tell your parents .
i tried , but i couldn' t .
why ?
i think no one wants to hear that .
mum would smother me even more , and dad would disappear at once ...
i think that , deep down , i like it that no one knows .
to imagine the look on their faces when they' il hear the news .
did you think of the remorse , the guilt you are going to cause ?
yes .
sometimes .
i don' t mind .
i won' t be around to see it .
it' s childish .
selfish .
give me a hand .
you' re not finishing your food ?
no .
i' m full .
it was very good .
make an effort .
you must eat .
is that allowed ?
everything is allowed now .
can i have one ?
who did you tell ?
no one .
only you .
your friends , colleagues ?
no .
i didn' t say anything .
i distanced myself , said i needed a holiday .
your sister ?
are you crazy ?
i didn' t tell her .
she would be too happy , she would love to pity me , just like she does her children .
there' s no shame in inspiring pity or tender feelings .
it could be an opportunity for you to talk to each other .
i don' t feel like it .
not with her .
and sacha ?
i didn' t have the guts .
why did you tell me , then ?
because you are like me .
you will die soon .
did you take your medication ?
yes .
i' il prepare my vitamins .
we didn' t go for a walk in the woods .
we could go tomorrow morning , before you leave .
never mind .
i just wanted to see the spot where we built a hut with sophie .
there are a few bits of it left .
anti oxydation . this is for the skin , this for the hair , this for bones , against osteoporosis .
this is some type of omega ,
you see , with all this ,
i will die in excellent health .
don' t talk nonsense .
that' s true .
you know , romain ...
what ?
tonight , i would like to leave with you .
i don' t know what to do .
i don' t know what' s good .
i follow my instinct .
after your grandfather' s death , i was a wreck .
i thought i was gonna die .
so i left , i fled .
i abandoned my child .
your father .
i could not take care of him anymore , it was not possible .
i kept seeing jacques in his smile , in his eyes .
i was called a bad mother , a whore even .
your father never forgave me .
but i know i was right .
if i had not left , if i had not had all these lovers , i would have died too .
you may call it selfishness , but it' s only survival instinct .
why do you tell me all this ?
because we are alike .
knock knock , madam .
would you by chance have any food ?
what for ?
i have not eaten in two days .
i am very poor .
but i did not invite you .
romain .
have a look .
what ?
look here !
a rabbit !
what' s wrong ?
why doesn' t he move ?
he must be sick .
can i bring it home to cure it ?
it' s no use .
they can pass you lots of diseases .
please , dad !
don' t insist !
put it down .
if we leave it , it will be eaten !
nature' s law , romain .
come on .
come on .
did i wake you ?
no .
what' s the matter ?
you cannot sleep ?
no .
i cannot .
do you want to talk ?
no .
i just want to sleep in your bed .
you know i sleep naked .
it' s ok i won' t peek .
ok .
i' m ready .
you don' t want to stay for lunch ?
i' m not hungry .
on the road , if you are tired , make sure you stop .
ok .
this is for you .
picked them early this morning .
for my funeral ?
when you don' t want them anymore , throw them away .
i love you .
me too .
don' t cry , or it will be too tough .
romain .
what ?
wouldn' t you try chemotherapy , just for my sake ?
you know perfectly well it won' t work .
you never know .
things can happen like ...
miracles ?
yes .
you don' t believe that yourself .
i believe in you !
you are sweet .
too bad we didn' t meet earlier , i would have married you .
where will you go when you get back ?
i' il stay home .
call me , ok ?
ok .
let me take a picture .
7 euro , please .
thank you .
have a nice day .
hello .
do you recognize me ?
yes .
can i sit down ?
sure .
i work at the gas station across the road , i came to see my husband .
i see .
we would like to ask you something .
yes ?
well , my husband has problems .
yes ?
he' s sterile .
so ?
well .
we both find you very handsome ... we would like to ask you ... if you would accept to sleep with me .
since you are young , we thought you probably wouldn' t mind too much .
he' s ok with it , don' t worry .
well ...
i ...
you don' t have aids ?
no .
we could try , if you want .
we saved a bit of money , we could pay you .
no .
don' t bother .
you do not want ?
i' m not interested .
i don' t like children .
romain , the place is clear .
i took all my stuff .
bye .
sasha
strange , i dream a lot .
you were in my last one .
we were sleeping together .
it was sweet and very sexual at the same time .
it was making me feel good .
funny , cos you' re not my type at all .
actually in my dreams i sleep with anyone .
my father , my mother ... even with myself as a kid , i guess i' m enjoying it before i die .
time heals everything , except for us .
lately you' ve been aggressive , violent , full of disdain towards me . while i was making efforts , trying to understand you .
trying to make overtures , maybe awkwardly but i was trying .
i don' t understand your attitude , what it is you hate so much in me .
i often remember the games we played as children , that complicity that brought us together , our quarrels , our enthusiasm and that brotherly love that has disappeared and which i miss so much .
i hope to hear from you .
i' ve taken the first step and i now wait for yours .
your loving sister , sophie .
allo ?
it' s me .
romain ?
yes .
it feels strange hearing your voice ...
i wanted to let you know i received your letter .
so ?
do you find it ridiculous ?
no .
it moved me .
it was good for me .
that' s great .
you know sophie , i' d like to come and visit you but i don' t quite have the strength lately .
working too hard ?
yeah , that' s it .
i understand .
i' m already very happy that you called .
i wanted to let you know , it' s not your fault .
i' m the one not feeling too well lately , the one going a bit mad .
don' t worry .
ok .
alrite , i' m gonna leave you now .
anyway , if you want to see the kids , don' t hesitate to call .
ok , but you' re the one i' d like to see .
not your kids .
kisses .
and i' il be waiting for your call .
kisses .
thanks , romain .
we' re too short .
let' s take a chair .
hello !
hello .
have you been waiting for long ?
no , i just arrived .
you don' t look too good are you ok ?
yeah
you should get some sun .
yeah .
and you , how are you ?
they finally hired me !
great .
yes , i am happy .
it' s all thanks to you .
no .
i know you called to recommend me .
well , if you know ...
anyway , if they hired you it' s because you had the right profile .
and you ?
i hear that you stopped working ?
i needed a break , and ... ... you met someone , didn' t you .
why do you say that ?
i know you .
incapable of staying alone !
do i know him ?
no .
how old ?
my age .
good , that' s what you needed .
did you meet anyone new ?
no .
nothing serious , one night stands .
that' s what i need now : no complications !
see you soon .
you' il call me ?
yeah .
well , no ...
why do you say that ?
what' s wrong ?
you' re not feeling well ?
i forgot to tell you something .
what ?
it' s not easy to say ...
can you walk me back ?
sure .
do you want a vodka ?
you drink during the day now ?
yeah , occasionally .
ok , one vodka .
so ?
wel ...
i miss you .
is that so ?
it' s a bit late now , isn' t it ?
yeah , i know .
i' d like to ask you one thing .
what ?
i would like us to make love one last time .
i want to touch you , feel your skin .
i don' t feel like it .
do i disgust you ?
no , i just don' t feel like it anymore .
it' s over .
just once .
one last time .
whatever for ?
whatever for ...
funny you should say that ,
it' s a phrase i keep repeating lately ,
it' s stuck in my head .
except today i didn' t think about it , you were the one who said it .
you know what ?
i would feel like a whore ,
like i' m doing it to thank you for the job .
i don' t want that .
i understand .
give me your hand .
can you feel my heart ?
yes .
it' s still beating .
good morning .
good morning .
i' m ready .
sorry ?
you don' t want anymore , it' s too late ?
too late ?
for the kid ?
no , it' s fine .
if you still want , i accept .
we do it now .
this is my will .
i recognize the child mme jeannie charron is bearing whose birth is scheduled for april 9th , 2005 , and make it my sole heir .
which means it will inherit my entire wealth .
have i expressed your wishes entirely ?
yes , perfect .
for the funerals , any particular wish you would like to include ?
incineration .
any religious ceremony ?
that' s not necessary .
alright .
here' s the act .
initial the first page and sign the second page .
same thing for the witnesses please .
i don' t ask you out for lunch .
i' m exhausted .
and not hungry .
neither are we .
i' il take my leave now .
do you want us to give you a lift ?
it' s ok ; i' il take a cab .
thank you for everything .
i should be the one thanking you .
we' d like to ask you something .
but we do not dare .
what ?
do you know if your illness is hereditary , for the kid ?
no , don' t worry .
it' s a cancer .
incurable .
ah , ok .
call us if you want to see us , or if you need anything .
ok .
i would like to ask you something too .
yes ?
is he moving ?
no .
it' s not even two months yet .
as soon as he moves , let me know .
i' il come and touch your belly .
ok .
good bye then .
will you be alright ?
yeah .
i hope so .
good luck .
