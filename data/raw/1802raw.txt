mr. maestro , leonard bernstein , tape number one .
mr. bernstein ...
i have the utmost respect for you .
your music ... is both pure and honest .
and that is why i have chosen you ... to present the truth about me to the world .
my name is sam bicke .
and i consider myself a grain of sand .
on this beach called america ... there are 211 million grains of sand ... three billion on the beach we call earth .
if i am lucky ...
the action that i am about to take ... will show the powerful ... that even ... the least grain of sand ... has in him ... the power to destroy them .
these come in brown ?
we do have that in a brown .
and a harvest gold .
and an avocado .
give me three of the brown and an avocado .
are you interested in that chair ?
this is a naugahyde , very good for avoiding stains .
i look like that big a slob ?
i can' t sit on this plastic stuff .
i get sweaty and stick to it .
this doesn' t come in leather , huh ?
not this chair ...
jack jones .
bill wilson .
bill , what our new associate' s trying to explain , i think is ... that this is leather with a naugahyde coating .
coating ?
exactly .
comfort of leather .
just a little easier to clean .
no extra cost .
how does it feel ?
it is comfy .
you know what you look like sitting there ?
what ?
you look like the boss .
are you the boss ?
i got my own place .
what did i tell you ?
did you write the gentleman up , sam ?
no , he didn' t ...
write the gentleman up .
can we deliver this for you monday , or is tuesday better ?
tuesday' s probably better .
<i>mr .
bernstein , sir ... </ i> <i>there are times that i have felt alone on this planet . </ i>
<i>and that' s how they want us , isn' t it ? </ i>
<i>alone .
divided .
weak . </ i>
to our new closer .
hear , hear .
you smell something ?
i do .
i smell success .
and you' ve got the odor .
all right , sam .
why do i say that to you , sam ?
well , i certainly am trying .
got nothing to do with trying .
it' s believing .
when you believe in what you' re selling , you succeed .
because then you' re not selling .
you see what i' m saying ?
you' re talking from somewhere here .
you' ve got to believe .
it' s a gift .
i' ve got it .
marty' s got it .
you may have it .
i can believe in anything .
isn' t that right , marty ?
it' s true .
you want to know who the greatest salesman in the world is ?
that man , right there .
he sold the whole country , 200 million people ... on himself .
twice .
and what was nixon' s sales pitch in ' 68 ?
in ' 68 , it was ...
he said he would end the war .
he would get us out of vietnam .
and what did he do ?
he sent another 100, 000 troops ... and then he bombed the living shit out of them .
that' s what he did .
now , what did nixon run on last year ?
ending the war in vietnam .
and he won .
by a landslide .
that is a salesman .
he made a promise .
he didn' t deliver .
and then he sold us on the same exact promise .
all over again .
that' s believing in yourself .
these are for you .
read them .
these , you listen to .
while you' re driving .
while you' re shaving .
while you' re taking a shit in the morning .
you gotta believe , sam .
this book right here will really teach you to believe in yourself .
this book right here will really teach you techniques .
these will make you a salesman .
i guarantee it .
<i>the salesman who believes is the salesman who receives . </ i>
<i>remember , power is a state of mind . </ i>
<i>you have as much as you think you have . </ i>
<i>if you don' t think you have any , you don' t . </ i>
<i>talk about yourself as you see yourself . </ i>
<i>and someday that will be yourself . </ i>

i should have said something on the spot .

i' m doing great .
i' m so tired of this .

i think it looks good .
and it makes me look a little older and trustworthy .
you would trust me .
that' s not really the point , though .
what i' m saying is ...
i' m surprised you would say that , bonny .
i really am .

if your father went away ... would that make you sad ?
he' s not gonna go away .
of course he' s not .
if he did ?
if your mommy wanted him to go .

i' m not sure i understand this business about the school bus .
that' s just it .
the bus is the business .
it' s a movable store .
a movable tire store ?
exactly .
you see , we take out all of the seats , just gut the whole bus ... and put the tires .
fill it up with the tires .
then you bring the tires to the customer , at his convenience .
you' re a delivery service .
that' s just the beginning of it , because i would bring the tire ... and change it , i' il put the tire on your car while you' re mowing the lawn .
or anything else that that you want to do .
and we' d paint the bus a bright red because that would give the company ... its own individual identity and make it memorable .
a sort of trademark .
and you have the bus already ?
my friend , my partner , bonny , has the bus and he has the tools .
and i bring the management experience .
and that you have as well ?
that i do , sir .
yes , i do .
it says here you' re currently employed as an office furniture salesman ?
that' s correct .
but i' m ready to move on .
and prior to office sales , you were a tire salesman with your father ?
julius bicke , that' s my brother .
brother .
okay , and why did you leave his employment ?
he expected me to lie .
i don' t believe that someone should have to lie to make a living .
all right .
over and over he would tell me ... <i>that 15 % is rock bottom . </ i>
sell below that , we lose money .
that' s a lie .
<i>in the retail tire business , the markup is always at least 30 % . </ i>
<i>so , 30 is rock bottom . </ i>
what one should tell the customer ...
let me show you .
good morning , mr. ford .
i think i understand , mr. bicke ...
let me just show you .
good morning .
sam bicke .
you' re here to buy tires .
yes .
let' s get down to brass tacks .
this is the deal .
<i>the markup on all of my tires is 30 % . </ i>
i will show you the company invoice to prove that to you .
i' il do that for you , mr. ford .
i' il make you my best offer .
i' il split the difference with you .
i' il take half the markup as my profit ... and you' il take half the markup as your savings .
even steven .
fair deal .
what do you think ?
what do i think ?
or ...
yes .
no , i' m back to normal now .
<i> it' s 15 % .
exactly . </ i>
but it' s the same thing , what your brother offered .
no .
my brother ... <i>will go to 15 % , but he wants you to hold at list . </ i>
<i>5 % if you have to ... </ i> <i>10 % if you' re gonna lose the customer out the door . </ i>
<i>but the salesman who offers 15 % , he' s a failure . </ i>
he' s a man who doesn' t know how to hold his ground .
and who do you think , at the end of the month ... gets the promotion , gets the bonus ?
the one with the biggest profit margin ?
the biggest liar .
i' m sorry .
i just want you to know that i would run an honest business .
that i would not ask my salesmen to lie ... or make them feel like a failure ... or some kind of a piece of garbage .
well , that' s ...
i admire that .
your idea ?
yes , sir .
well , that' s it .
that' s it ?
mr. ford , i want to thank you , sir , because this loan isn' t just for me .
i think it can change the way we think about american business .
mr. bicke , i' m really very sorry .
that' s it for now .
i have to send your application on to washington ... and they will review it .
and it' s a whole process .
of course .
mr. ford at the sba ...
bonny , i gotta tell you , he was very impressed .
did you tell him the bus don' t run ?
i didn' t .
did you tell him your partner was black ?
i did , yes .
i checked the " negro " box .
that was stupid , sam .
this isn' t working .
no , bonny .
the government is looking for black businessmen .

<i>$125 is your total .

thank you .
you remind me of my ex wife .

they' re nice .
compliments and a good deal .
i should shop here more often .
you should , miss , or is it missus ?
miss .
is this the current phone ?
yes .
would you like me to deliver it ?
no .
that' s all right .
i' il have someone from the office stop by .
it wouldn' t be a problem .
i' il be just fine .
you already are .
i don' t want you to deliver it .
i' il have it picked up .
i didn' t mean me , personally .
we have people who deliver .
i think there' s been a misunderstanding .
i love my wife very much .
we are all married men .
family men .
yeah .
because ... what' s odd about your aborted flirtation with that woman today ... according to marty' s recollection , correct me if i' m wrong ... is that you referred to her dimples ... as being like those of your ex wife' s .
i don' t think i did that .
he sure did .
i think there' s been a misunderstanding .
as i told you when i took you on ...
i only hire married men .
a single salesman is distracted .
a divorced salesman fails at selling , the same as marriage .
it' s all right for a guy to ...
lie to some broad about not being married when he is .
that' s fine .
that' s to be expected .
but you wouldn' t expect that guy to lie to his boss , would you ?
i guess i did try to pick up on that woman .
i didn' t want you to think that i was being dishonest to my wife .
you did try to pick her up then ?
yes .
my son was correct in his estimation of your character ?
yes .
and if i were to ask you and your wife to join ... me and marty and our wives for dinner in , say , a week or two ... that would be okay with you ?
yes , i think that ...
she' d like that very much .
<i>when i was little i was taught not to be rude , mr. bernstein , but ... </ i> <i>what am i supposed to do about the people who won' t respect me ? </ i>
what i wanted to do is just check on the status of my application .
sorry , mr. bicke .
mr. ford should have told you , but processing takes eight to ten weeks .
no , he did not tell me that .
perhaps you could check back , say , september 1 .
september ?
yes .
i do understand your position .
i' m sure that you deal with a lot of incompetence .
but i am a businessman ... and a businessman can' t wait .
if you gonna have a future , you gotta make it .
so i would really appreciate it if i could see mr. ford .
what was your first name ?
samuel j.
i will talk to mr. ford ... and if he has time for a meeting , we' il call you next week .
since i' m here , maybe i could just see him ...
if he has time , we' il call you next week .
deal ?
deal .
least you could do is discourage him .
double bourbon and a vodka martini up .
it would help if you wore your wedding ring .
for god' s sake , sam , aren' t we done yet ?
would you consider going to the dinner ?
you could drive your own car .
i' m not gonna put on some charade .
if you' re their top salesman ... what do they care if you' re married , divorced , or queer ?
sir , you should be ashamed of yourself .
that woman is my wife .
they make her wear that .
sam .
really , it' s all right .
i' il just wait here .
i' m fine here .
mr. bicke , please ...
he' il understand .
he' il leave at some point and he' il be going to his car .
he' il leave at some point , i' il walk him down .
that' s all the time ...
mr. bicke .
mr. ford .
it' s good to see you , sir .
why don' t we step outside and get a cup of coffee ?
how' s that ?
coffee .
in the cafeteria .
actually , there' s a machine in the lobby .
the lobby' s fine .
have a seat .
now , how exactly can i help you , mr. bicke ?
yes , well , sir ...

the landlord was kind enough to allow me in .
he stopped by .
i see you received his note .
julius .
we have some things to discuss , don' t you think ?
to discuss ?
good seeing you , of course .
cut the crap .
sit down .
you' re a very strange man , samuel .
i' ve always known this .
i' ve always tried to help .
so why would you steal from me , your brother ?
i didn' t steal ...
you did .
i had to bail your friend , bonny , out of jail this evening .
bonny ?
for receiving stolen goods .
my goods .
did you think roger zeffler wouldn' t become suspicious of your friend ?
<i>that somehow this delivery was kosher ?
that 550 tires belonged to that address ? </ i>
roger zeffler is a racist .
perhaps that' s so .
shame on roger zeffler .
but you are a crook .
so , you tell me , sam .
which shame is greater ?
i am not ...
look at me .
this is your brother .
do i deserve this now , for you to lie to me ?
julius , please .
no .
no " please , julius " .
no !
i have been to the police .
begging forgiveness for a mistake that was not a mistake .
because i took responsibility , samuel .
so that no one would go to jail .
so that this man , bonny , your friend , would not go to jail .
and my family caused this .
so you must tell me , sam , please ... which is the greater shame ?
i' m sorry , julius .
what is your name ?
i had an idea .
for a tire business .
like you .
i wanted to get a head start until my loan came in , and my loan was denied .
because they' re racists .
nixon .
all of them .
like zeffler .
i didn' t get the money because my partner is black .
i was gonna pay you back .
i' m just trying to keep my family together .
and the little guy just can' t do it anymore .
because there' s a cancer in the system .
the whole system has a cancer , and i' m being punished because i resist .
but somebody has to resist .
you' re my brother .
as of this moment , samuel ...
i wash my hands of you .
no more .
that' s it .
nothing .
and if you steal from me again , brother or no brother ...
i will send you to jail .
