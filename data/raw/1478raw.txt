you have filmed me .
in turn , i need you to be my model now .
otherwise , you can' t leave here .
jin , what do you want to take ?
do you love me ?
take it off .
jiney .
what are you doing ?
don' t move .
don' t you wanna play with me ?
i won' t move .
don' t move .
don' t move !
you want to make love with me , don' t you ?

i even can' t take a breath .
just clam down , tell me slowly .
please tell me ...
i really don' t want to hurt them .
but when i saw the photos ...
i can' t ... help .
i' m afraid i will loss control some day .
i' m afraid i' il kill somebody one day .
don' t be silly !
i take you to a doctor .
don' t worry , that' il be fine .
i stood in front of a mirror yesterday , the image myself .
i saw the mirror , i don' t know who it is .
i just wanna be myself .
good , be yourself .
you can make it .
i' m not going .
no doctor will believe in me .
even my mum does not believe in me .
she turned a blind eye when people bullied me .
i wanna die .
you ... don' t be like that .
don' t be like that ...
jin .
look at yourself .
no body can save you if you let yourself behave like this .
don' t keep thinking about that tragedy .
in any event , " you must tell your mum seriously once again .
that tragedy had happened .
you must learn how to forget about that .
you' il be fine .
do you know ?
mum !
jin !
wait a moment please , i have a call from my daughter .
sorry .
jin , what' s up ?
why don' t you go to bed , " it' s already 4am there at your end .
mum , when will you come back ?
around next week .
jin , anything' s wrong ?
as i' m not always beside you , i' m also worrying about you .
jin ...
jin ...
mum ...
i have something to tell you .
if i don' t tell you tonight ,
i will hate you for the rest of my life .
i don' t wanna be like that .
jin ... don' t cry , tell mum .
i thought you have gone .
it looks delicious !
let' s finish it .
anyway ,
you look so cool when you slapped me last night
if you don' t wake up , i will kick you .
what if that still doesn' t work ?
then i' il die .
ok , go ahead .
jin , what leaves you such a countenance ?
no , nothing .
the photos could be bogus .
you have took so many photos before .
but the problem is ... who gave me these photos .
the person who gave the photos to me must know ...
calm down !
jas , where are you , come over here .
it looks so real .
it doesn' t only look real , it' s actually real .
but in terms of the sound effect and the editing , " it seems like a short film .
the last shot couldn' t be a fake one .
the girl really is the one in the photos .
let' s report this to the police .
you' re crazy , no one will believe in you " with this videotape .
if the video is really a fake one , " then who is one who made this senseless stuff ?
that person must know what you like .
tell me , why did you make this senseless stuff ?
i' ve told you before , you' re a nice guy .
but i won' t love you .
you will only make me hate you by doing these senseless things .
you don' t need to say anything , just stop playing tricks on me !
excuse me , check please !
sorry , i thought you would like that .
i don' t know that you will have such a great antipathy feeling .
i was almost scared to death by the stuffs that you gave me .
my skill is really below standard .
no , it looks so real ,
it conveys such a great feeling , who is that girl ?
what girl ?
who is ...
the one who screams loudly ,
what actually did you see ?
there' s only jiney .
what are you talking about ?
who' s screaming ?
i am talking about the tape and photos you sent me !
photos and tape ?
i only made a special music video for you ,
i just sent it to you by email .
how about the letter ?
what letter ?
oh i got it , that' s why i have to sit here and bullshit by you two .
i consulted my friends , " " since we haven' t received any blackmailing ,
and the tape itself can' t be strong enough to prove anything , " the best we can do is just to file a police record .
jin , it' s alright .
perhaps there' s some silly guys make joke on you .
i wanna come and stay with you from tomorrow .
then you don' t need to scare .
hey , jas , are you going to come ?
yeah , i' m coming .
jas ...
