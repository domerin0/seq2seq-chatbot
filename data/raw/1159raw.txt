the tux has to be back ; he used his mom' s credit card .

unless you want to play ball .
i could do 20 years standing on my head , boys .
as i' m sure you could .
you know , carmine , i' ve got to be honest ,
it' s devastating .
tragic .
lf angelo marcello is worried you' il talk , he might hear you' re upset about getting passed over for promotion .
you know how rumors fly .
like rockets .
to the moon .
do you take your show on the road ?
go to schools ?
keep kids off drugs ?
because your little puppet show , very entertaining .
yeah ?
who do you think is pulling strings ?
clearly , angelo marcello is pulling the strings .
and if he thinks that you' re talking , you' re going to be doing a lot more time six feet under .
unless , unless , and i' m just thinking out loud here , but um ... unless you actually do talk , then we can at least help you out .
six accused members of the marcello crime family , including mafia boss angelo marcello , were found guilty today of twelve counts of extortion and racketeering .
prosecutors credited the victory to testimony of longtime marcello crime family member ,
carmine " the beans " pasquale .
pasquale is now believed to have entered the federal witness protection program .
let' s go live ... ... not being able to see her great grandson no more ,
grandma florentino is gonna be heartbroken .
oh , please !
when she came from the old country , the statue said ,
give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses ...
know why they huddled ?
she was beatin ' the crap out of everybody with that wooden spoon .
you know what , carmine ?
the place may change , but you' il always be a jerk .
will you guys shut up ?
oh !
you do not talk to me like that .
you know what this is ?
rap music .
it breeds disrespect like a fungus .
slim shady , puff daddy .
he goes by p diddy for short .
for short ?
why ?
it takes all day to say " puff " ?
oh !
i' m exhausted .
look who' s talking about names .
they call you carmine " the beans .
yes , because i grind my own beans for coffee .
a nickname has to be married ...
what ?
you' re no longer known as " carmine the beans .
you' re george , linda , and patrick cheeseman .
cheeseman .
what is that , french ?
who' s patrick ?
who' s george ?
because i ain' t no " george .
i ain' t no " george , " either .
i think linda' s a beautiful name .
i always wished my mother had named me linda .
should' ve named you " chatty kathy .
i ain' t no " patrick .
they call you " pat " for short .
pat " is a girl' s name , and i ain' t no name that goes both ways .
look , we have driver' s licenses , birth certificates , bankcards , social security cards , and supermarket rewards cards .
they' re all made out to george , patrick , and linda cheeseman .
well then , i' m going by " rick , " because i ain' t no " pat .
so , agent banks , where we moving to ?
mr. and mrs. cheeseman , i' m special agent tuttle .
welcome to utah .
okay , the arrangements have been made for you to stay in a hotel tonight , then provide you with a vehicle .
how many wives you got ?
you' re not a mormon ?
i am .
the church hasn' t practiced polygamy for 1 00 years .
it' s the offshoot groups that still have plural wives .
you' d have to shoot me .
having one is bad enough .
it' d be nice to have more than one .
give me a break from you .
i' il grab your bags .
we' re right out here .
take a break .
fine .
go ahead .
find me somebody else .
preferably someone without a mustache and a bad attitude .
this looks like a whole lot of nothing .
actually , it was a desert wasteland when the mormon pioneers arrived in july of 1 84 7 .
under the leadership of president brigham young , the entire area ...
you work for the park service or the fbl ?
patrick , there' s a lot to do ...
it' s rick !
there' s a lot to do just a day' s drive from here .
we' ve got the grand canyon , there' s hollywood , disneyland ...
disneyland .
my old man promised to take me and you know what ?
took off and never came back .
i haven' t had much desire to visit there ever since .
i' m afraid it' il bring up too much repressed anger .
yeah ?
so , take a prozac like a normal person .
so , what' s the neighborhood we' re moving into like ?
i received a page .
i have a family emergency .
we' d like to excuse bishop harrison who' s had to attend to a very important family matter .
our concluding speaker will be brother chris moore .
brother moore .
it' s okay .
hang on , brother moore .
let me try and get this a little higher for you .
brothers and sisters , i' m grateful for the opportunity to stand before you this ...
hang on .
it' s moving , it' s good .
it' s coming .
thank you .
sorry to hear about bishop harrison' s dad .
when are they leaving for the funeral ?
first thing in the morning .
they' re worried about how his mom' s going to handle the farm alone .
he' il be gone 3 4 weeks to sort things out .
with the bishop gone , does that mean we won' t have church ?
no , sweetie , with the bishop gone , your daddy' s first counselor to the bishop and he' il be in charge .
he certainly had things under control today , didn' t he ?
thanks for the support there , jewels .
anytime , bro .
exactly when are your parents getting back from the philippines ?
two years , ten months .
you got a countdown ?
technically she is my aunt , but i despise her like a sister .
there' s a " sold " sign on the cooper house .
when did that happen ?
i don' t know .
it has been vacant for a while .
be nice to have someone in there .
he had eight stitches .
yes , i just got off the phone with his wife .
with bishop harrison gone for who knows how long , the inmates are running the asylum .
michael james in charge ?
please .
mom .
sister johnson' s on the phone .
hold on , robin .
mary jo , did you hear ?
eight stitches .
what ?
are you sure ?
when ?
run to the cooper' s house and see if there' s a " sold " sign .
mom .
i wonder who' s moving in .
this place is a shoebox !
it' s a great house , george .
we got a satellite , right ?
actually , we cover the house , but amenities are extra .
the government pays three grand for a military toilet seat , but they can' t pop for hbo ?
i can' t believe it .
why not send us to the amish ?
because they sent us to the mormons .
yeah , same difference .
honestly , no , it' s not .
right because the amish wear black shirts and ride in buggies , but the mormons wear white shirts and ride bikes .
completely different .
okay .
look , george ...
i hate that name .
mr. cheeseman .
worse .
this right here is your first month' s stipend .
you' il get a few more until you' re on your feet .
what do i do for a ride ?
you' il get that red minivan .
are you kidding me ?
i think it' s real cute .
you would .
you drove an amc pacer when we met .
i loved it .
i was heartbroken when it got stolen .
you still think it got stole ?
i paid butch 20 bucks to drive it into the river .
why are you complaining ?
i bought you a new lroc z.
oh !
hi .
i' m chris moore .
these clowns are stealing my stuff !
we' re your neighbors .
we' re just here to help .
oh .
don' t break nuthin ' .
george , you' ve got to understand people here are friendlier than what you' re normally used to .
yeah , here two days , and no one has flipped us the bird .
i don' t want friendly .
i just want to be left alone .
hi .
hi .
i wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood .
thank you .
please come in .
thanks .
um , i' m louise means .
i' m linda cheeseman .
this is my husband , george .
nice to meet you , george .
these are for you .
thank you .
have a seat .
oh , thanks .
so , where did you move from ?
omaha , nebraska .
you have a slight eastern accent .
we' re from the eastern side .
so , anything you want to know about the neighborhood or the neighbors ?
i got a question .
you' re not going to come knocking on my door 8 : 00 am saturday , are you ?
why would somebody do that ?
come on .
i know you people .
it' s what you do .
you go door to door , knock , knock , knock , talking to people , preaching your mormon bible .
meanwhile , inside are staying down trying not to make a noise , so you think we' re not home .
so , you' re not members ?
members of what ?
louise hasn' t wasted any time burning up the phone lines
letting people know they' re not members of the church .
i just hope she hasn' t offended them .
we' il do a little damage control .
we' il show them the rest of us are just regular , normal people .
um , we can see you' ve got a lot of unpacking to do .
we didn' t want to intrude .
we just wanted to come over and introduce ourselves say " hello .
no , it' s no intrusion ; it' s very nice of yous .
something to drink ?
oh no .
no , let us get you something .
okay , great .
thank you .
i' il get you a beer .
uh , no .
that' s okay .
you said okay .
all right .
whatever .
how bout you , toots ?
um , no , no , i' m fine thanks .
what' re you thinking ?
she' s not going to be drinking while she' s pregnant .
why not ?
you did .
actually , we don' t drink at all ... alcohol .
ls that a mormon thing ?
yes , we don' t drink alcohol .
we got coffee .
hey , that website i would get my imported coffee from , what was that called ?
i don' t know .
i' il google it .
it' s okay , because we don' t drink coffee , either .
we' il , go to the kiddy menu .
i' il get you a coke ; and you a diet coke .
you' re not going to believe this .
um , there' s some members of our church that um , choose to drink cola drinks , but michael and i , we happen to not drink cola drinks .
what do you do for liquid refreshment ?
what , is your mother still nursing you ?
thank you so much .
yeah .
goodnight .
goodnight .
nice to meet yous .
thanks , you too .
bye bye .
that was interesting .
yep .
uh , hello , ma' am .
i' m rick cheeseman .
we just moved in down the street .
i' m blanche brinkerhoff .
nice to meet you .
blanche , louise means is on the phone .
i' il call her back .
i was just walking around meeting the neighbors and uh ,
i was wondering , do you know those people with the satellite dish ?
that' s bishop harrison' s .
i knocked , but nobody answered .
they' re out of town .
really ?
i see .
hey , you wouldn' t happen to have a ladder and some power tools , would ya ?
i still have homework .
which you wouldn' t have if you hadn' t been on the phone .
lf i still lived in california , i could see my friends and not worry about making time for phone calls .
and making time to get up earlier to do your homework , because now it' s time for bed .
good night .
i hate this place !
you know , we need to make an effort and reach out .
really ?
i was thinking more along the lines of a padded room with a big lock , and the only contact is to slide food through this tiny , little slot .
what ?
i' m talking about dealing with your sister and her attitude .
i was talking about the cheesemans and their not being members .
what do you mean ?
well , i' ve just been thinking .
i know what it feels like to be the minority .
my dad moves us down to the south , and suddenly , i' m the only mormon in a high school filled with born again christians .
i mean , i was voted most likely to burn in hell .
i think dealing with your sister comes in close second to eternal damnation .
didn' t i get you dr. phil' s book on teenagers ?
you said were going to open it .
ten stupid things women do to mess up their lives .
seriously honey , i know she' s your sister , and i love her .
i do ; but something has to be done .
okay .
all right .
i' il , uh , i' il talk to her .
i promise , i' il ...
a little tough love .
you will ?
sure .
okay .
thanks .
and about the cheesemans , why don' t i call linda tomorrow and see if they want to come to dinner ?
yes , yes .
good .
that would be nice .
i just , i don' t know ,
i gotta do something , with the bishop gone gotta step it up a notch .
don' t worry .
you' re doing a great job .
don' t stress .
the cheesemans will fit in just fine .
excuse me , uh .
how you doin ' ?
that' s my paper .
oh yeah .
here you go .
you live here ?
yeah .
yeah .
we' re neighbors ... over there .
that ... house .
yeah , well uh , my wife and i were thinking about coming over tonight or sometime or ...
do you mind , uh ?
what ?
oh yeah .
sure .
that blonde girl .
that' s your wife ?
nice .
hey , you got one like that , who needs twelve ?
ugh , this coffee is awful !
really ?
what do you mean " really ?
you think i' m lyin ' ?
nah , i believe you .
no , no you don' t .
you' re questioning me .
it wasn' t a question .
lf there was a stenographer here writing down our little jovial repartee here , she would have typed , " really " with a question mark .
i' ve had a lot of stuff read back to me that i said that i didn' t remember saying .
i meant i was surprised that it was bad .
how could you ?
don' t you drink it ?
nah , i don' t drink coffee .
let me guess .
you' re mormon .
yeah .
maybe that' s why mormons don' t drink it .
because no one knows how to make a good cup .
you know what , just give me the paper and a pick six .
a pick six of what ?
numbers .
winners .
you' ve got to be kidding me .
besides not making good coffee ,
utah ain' t got no lottery either .
they got no horse track .
they got no lottery .
they got nuthin ' up here .
how far away is vegas ?
i don' t know , but don' t talk about vegas .
these people are the good , church goin ' type .
that' s another thing .
i' il go in there , i' il eat their crappy , white bread food , but i ain' t holdin ' hands , and i ain' t singin ' no " kumbaya .
take those off .
these people invite us to dinner .
you' re gonna be pleasant .
i' m just sayin ' , if they bring out the bible pictionary gone .
a perfect game for you ; no words all pictures .
that' s very funny .
let me tell you something .
let me tell you ...
hi .
the kids are already started .
everybody , this is the cheeseman family .
uh , george , linda , their son rick .
kepi , laura , a couple of friends .
how ya doin ' ?
nice to meet yous .
you remember kate .
hi , so glad you could make it .
and uh , several of the children here .
we' ve got more running around here someplace .
shocker !
hey , we brought you somethin ' .
oh , thanks .
you shouldn' t have , really .
we wanted to .
it' s not booze or nuthin ' .
yoohoo !
you shake it .
it' s good , right ?
yeah .
so george , what did you do in omaha before the move ?
i was in waste management .
then that' s what brought you out here ?
ln a manner of speaking , yeah .
how ' bout you , big guy ?
what' s your story ?
how' s that ?
i haven' t seen black people in utah .
did you get lost on your way to somewhere ?
no .
i' m not black ; i' m tongan .
i don' t keep up with the whole politically correct thing .
you know , i mean , first you' re negroes .
then you' re blacks .
now you' re african americans .
now you' re the tongans ?
i don' t think it' s as catchy whatever .
no .
i mean i' m from tonga .
it' s a south pacific island .
oh , like " survivor .
i love that show .
i bet it' s very clean there .
we moved here for my husband' s health .
the air is better .
yeah , there' s no cigarette smoke .
let me ask yous , is that like the body is a temple sort of thing ?
what' s that ?
the no smoking .
oh yeah , yeah .
it' s a health code that the church practices .
i' il tell you something .
i have seen some of the biggest , chunkiest people
i have ever seen in my life waddling around utah .
that was rude to say !
that' s not rude .
it' s just , it' s the truth .
you' ve given up smokes ; you' ve given up booze .
maybe should think about giving up baked goods .
chungaloones over here .
we should have made fruit salad .
no , no .
i don' t mean yous .
fifty , a hundred pounds overweight , that' s not a big deal .
i am talking about fat people .
people walk down the street , and you go , " fat guy !
look at this guy .
he is a fat guy .
guy on jerry springer 1 7 00 pounds .
what does he do for halloween ?
white sheet over his head and he goes as one of the alps ?
what ?
this is michael with bishop harrison a few years ago .
let me ask yous two , are you like what , assistant ministers ?
well , uh , we' re what you call " counselors to the bishop .
like the consigliere .
we also have full time jobs too .
our work at the church is voluntary .
that' s right .
that' s right .
i know you don' t have anything lined up yet .
i mean i could go into work and talk to my manager about you if you' d like .
oh , that' d be great .
this is so nice .
look at all this you got here .
you even saved your kid' s hospital ld tag from when they was born .
you know what ?
lf you' re interested , there are a ton of scrapbooking stores around here .
it' s really popular .
there' s stores where people come to save their junk ?
oh yeah , they do very well .
besides , it' s not junk .
it' s preserving memories .
preserving memories ?
what are you going to preserve ?
what , old cocktail napkins with guys ' phone numbers on ' em ?
okay .
who wants desert ?
sorry about my dad ; he' s kind of got a big mouth .
you know what ?
he' s hysterical .
my family is so boring with their domestic tranquility lifestyle .
your brother seems like kind of a cool guy .
yeah , whatever .
he was my last resort .
i lived in california before my parent' s moved to the philippines .
my dad had to become a mission president over there .
so jacked up .
i didn' t want to go , so i had to come here .
your dad was a mission president .
what' s that ?
those guys that come to your door to talk about the mormon church .
mormon missionaries .
yeah .
well , the mission president is the really old guy in charge of all those young guys .
i thought it would be cool to give the mormons the jehovah' s witnesses ' addresses and the jehovah' s witnesses the mormons ' addresses .
have ' em go at it
like religion' s version of the bloods and the crips .
do you ski ?
no .
i might do something , if i don' t want to die of boredom .
at least you have a satellite dish to entertain you .
you saw that ?
your secret' s safe with me .
hey , no boys in the room .
you know the rules .
that was at home .
i didn' t know that applied here .
same family , same rules .
i' m sorry , sir .
i didn' t mean to disrespect .
you didn' t know .

let' s go .

baseball , basketball , wrestling ...
wrestling ?
you mean like , you know , busting heads , fightin ' ?
well , it' s not like on tv .

what is this ?
the three little pigs ?
i don' t need a book .
i know this story !
you ready to hear it ?
all right .
antonio , joseppi , and fredo .
antonio , he lived in a straw house .
and fredo , nice brick house with the cobblestone driveway and the lights underneath that show the trees at night adds to the curb appeal .
one day , antonio , in the straw house , is sittin ' around , pickin ' his teeth , watchin ' television , when he hears a knock on the door .
it' s a soft knock .
the door' s made of straw .
outside he hears , " big bad wolf ,
i' m here to collect my protection money .
this is money that the wolf charges them every month not to eat them .
protection money .
they' d give money in an envelope .
antonio was just sick of it .
he doesn' t want to pay the wolf .
so antonio says , " forget it !
i' m not payin ' you anymore !
now , this of course , makes the wolf very irate .
so , he says , " i am gonna huff , i am gonna puff , and i am gonna b b b b blow your house down !
antonio is very , very upset , and the wolf huffs and he puffs ... blows it down .
now , antonio is losing his little pig mind , running around screaming and yelling .
his house is ruined .
he' s got no insurance .
he runs to his buddy joseppi' s house .
boom , boom , boom .
" he blew it d " " yes , he blew it down !
come on inside , sit down , have an espresso , relax .
they' re freakin ' out .
next thing you know boom , boom , boom .
who do you think it is ?
big bad wolf .
exactly .
the big bad wolf .
wolf says , " all right , i' m a huff .
i' m a puff , and i' m gonna b b blow your house down !
there' s sticks all over the street .
people are slipping and falling like a john woo film .
it' s crazy !
now these two pigs are out of their ... minds .
don' t know what to do .
they run to their buddy fredo' s with the big brick house .
boom , boom .
he blew down our house .
fredo says , " all right , come in .
help .
he' s gonna cut us .
he' s gonna eat us .
fredo' s like , " please , have an espresso ?
calm down .
relax .
i' il take care of it .
fredo is as cool as a cucumber .
walks over to the phone .
he dials some associates and hangs up the phone .
the next thing you know ... big black cadillac limo pulls up in front of fredo' s brick house .
two goomba pigs in dark suits get out .
they say ,
excuse me .
you the big bad wolf ?
he says , " yeah .
they pick him up by his lapels and start bangin ' him against the side of the house , crackin ' his brain against the wall !
then the pig reaches into his pocket , pulls out his 9mm , puts it against the wolf' s temple badabing !
they blow his brains all over his suit .
boom !
uh , george , i think we' re ...
this is the best part .
i think we probably ...
this is the best part !
trust me !
then antonio and joseppi they go , " fredo , who was that ?
fredo goes , " ah , those guys ?
those are my cousins , the guinea pigs .
guinea pigs ...
never mind .
the end !
yeah !
yeah !!
good kids , good kids .
hey , tell you what kids , here .

let me introduce you to george here , first .
he just moved in a few weeks ago .
this is president perry .
he' s a stake president , we call that .
he' s a sort of the leader of many of the local congregations .
like a president .
like president of the mormons ?
something like that , yeah .
what , you want to be the teamsters now ?
the mormon jimmy hoffa ?
did i mention that george is from omaha ?
my son served a mission to omaha .
bet he knocked on your door .
well , if he did , i didn' t answer it , mr. hoffa .
the hinge aisle , president , is just over in this area .
i' il take care of this .
great .
nice to have met you .
wife' s got ' im working .
yeah , what ?

here .
you don' t got a saw at home ?
all right .
you want it exactly in half ?
preferably .
as close as you can get .
you have used one of these before ?
yeah , but not to cut wood .
kate .
oh , louise , you startled me .
i' m sorry .
i' m just out for my morning stroll .
i noticed when the postman put the mail in , the postcard from your in laws in the philippines .
oh .
it' s nice to see things are going well for them .
thank you .
yeah , you know , normally i' m not one to pry into other people' s affairs .
no , of course not .
i thought you should know , the other night i was taking a walk , and um , minding my own business , of course ...
of course .
with the cheeseman boy .
and ?
he' s not a member of the church .
ah .
who knows what his values are .
i mean , to encourage them to socialize .
i mean really .
well , i thought that you and your husband , with him being in a position of leadership , would want to set the standard for the community , you know .
you know what , louise ?
we are setting a standard .
we had the cheesemans over for dinner .
it' s called " friendshipping .
you know what ?
you should try it sometime .
i see .
hmmm , i hope so .
patricia ?
yeah , it' s louise .
the end of your first big day .
bringin ' home the bacon .
my old man used to say success comes in a pair of overalls and works eight hours a day .
it feels good .
do you feel that ?
it feels good .
yeah .
all right .
i' il see you tomorrow .
eight hours a day , forty hours a week !
how do you people do it ?
huh ?
good afternoon , ma' am .
i' m looking for the owner .
yes , i' m the owner , francis eastlack .
mrs. eastlack , i' m brigham smith from scrapbookers local 327 .
from where ?
scrapbookers 327 .
it' s the local scrapbooking union .
i didn' t know scrapbookers had a union .
well , you' re supposed to .
you' re also supposed to pay your union dues .
union dues ?
yes , ma' am .
how many employees do you have ?
six .
two full time and four part time .
well , as you know , it' s $50 a month per person .
that' s for the full timers .
for part timers we have to charge double dues because we find that they exert a bigger suck on the pension and health programs .
so , that' s two workers at $50 a month , four at a $1 00 a month .
that' s $500 a month you have to pay .
i have to pay ?
yes , ma' am .
i thought employees paid for things like that .
what kind of money do employees make ?
minimum wage .
and it looks like you' re doing pretty well here .
it' s a beautiful store .
well , yes .
that' s why you' re responsible .
let' s talk about back dues .
now , unfortunately , i' m not able to wipe out an entire 1 2 month period of back dues .
however , what i can do is i can only go back three months .
so , that' s this month plus three months of back dues .
that would be $2, 000 you have to pay .
that' s a lot of money !
ls it mrs. eastlack ?
ls it really ?
don' t you think it' s in everyone' s best interest ?
you wouldn' t want a strike now , would you ?
strike ?
oh yes , ma' am .
your employees parading up and down that beautiful sidewalk , carrying large signs , and screaming about how unfairly they' re being treated .
we are very fair .
exactly .
that' s why you have to pay the $2, 000 .
well , will you take a check ?
do you have a driver' s license and a major credit card ?
what can i get you ?
yeah , could i get a pound of your capicola ?
i' m sorry ?
capicola .
produce section is back there .
it' s not produce ; it' s ham .
we have boiled ham .
i don' t want boiled ham .
i want capicola ham .
hey , uh ... do we have any uh ... cappuccino ham ?

canadian bacon and pineapple .
it' s very popular here .

i wanted to try something new .
i though we were havin ' manicotti .
i needed something easy , i' m goin ' out tonight .
there' s a women' s night at the church .

it would be nice , yous getting together and doin ' something fun like that .
why do i wanna go ?
i got a house .
it' s freezing cold outside .

they ended up putting themselves on their own pizza .
you know what , this is ...
i' m outta here .
forget it .
i' m gonna go get something to eat somewhere else , and not in the woods .
let me get this straight .
you' re telling me you are the largest wholesale distributor of scrapbooking materials in the entire state of utah ?
and most of ldaho .
no kiddin ' .
where you were from again ?
save all memories of the children .
what is that ?
you heard of " save the children ?
well , we save all the memories .
what our organization does , in a nutshell , is we raise money for underprivileged children all around the globe , so that they can keep a scrapbook .
these little tikes , they' re gonna grow up , they' re gonna ' become doctors and lawyers and such , and with these scrapbooks , they' re gonna be able to refer back and see how far they' ve come .
that' s very considerate .
i agree .
how else we gonna know about these kids ?
you' ve seen them .
it' s truly sad , with the bloated bellies and the flies flyin ' around them .
how we gonna know bout ' em if there ain' t someone there takin ' pictures while the flies are buzzin ' ?
we' d be more than happy to donate scrapbooking materials .
i appreciate that ; i really do .
thing is , we already got us a government contract to purchase the scrapbookin ' supplies .
all we' re looking for quite frankly , and there ain' t no way to sugarcoat it , is financial donations .
it' s for the children .
yeah , salt lake city to rio de janeiro , brazil .
this friday .
do ya got something in the morning ?
i' il take that .
first class .
one seat .
and , no .
one way .
yes .
you know , rick , after dinner we' il check out the paintballing equipment if you' d like .
hey , thanks .
and thanks for letting me stay for dinner .
oh , it' s our pleasure .
but shouldn' t you call your parents so they know you' re here ?
oh no , that' s fine .
they got into another fight .
dad took off and mom drank a whole bottle of white zinfandel .
she' s facedown , you know , wasted .
so this works out fine .
so you ever actually played paintball before , rick ?
oh , no .
really ?
not everyone' s rambo .
some people lead civilized lives indoors .
it' s a shame your dad couldn' t make it with us .
he told me about his doctor' s appointment .
he told you he had an appointment ?
yeah , that' s why he won' t be coming paintballing with us .
i thought this was going to stay in the family , but i guess we can confide in you .
why , what' s wrong ?
well , dad dad' s got to get a colonoscopy .
oooh , wow !
what' s a colonoscopy ?
look on the lnternet .
no , no , no , no .
it' s just a doctor' s appointment , honey .
look rick , i don' t want you to worry .
it' s probably nothing , really .
i had an uncle ; he had a colonoscopy .
it was a buffalo head nickel that he' d swallowed when he was two years old .
they got it back too .
mint condition .
thing tripled in value .
there isn' t a paintballing merit badge yet , but some are working on it .
i like to use this space to practice .
we' il set up targets .
have you ever actually shot a gun before , rick ?
well , uh ...
well , it' s pretty easy .
use the rifleman approach the chuck connors .
keen haw , keen haw .
i like that .
some prefer sort of the delicate princess leah sort of a feel .
you know what i mean ?
you' re right .
that' s pretty cool .
look at that , yeah .
i was thinking of having that painted soon .
i' il put up some targets to shoot at .
how bout that ?
hey , it' s pretty fun .
ahhh !
yeah , you' re right .
that was fun .
yeah .
hey .
hey .
what' s your problem ?
you' ve been acting weird all day .
my problem is when friends come and spend the night hanging out with my brother .
so ?
you was hangin ' out too .
a good time is not to hang out with my brother .
i had a good time .
lf a good time is hangin ' out with my brother , you' ve got problems .
you said you had the problem .
i did .
shhh .
look , my brother is a complete dork .
and his wife is this little homemaking nazi .
your brother and wife are good people , and probably your mom and dad too .
you want nuthin ' to do with them ?
that' s another problem you got .
technically , that' s just an extension of the problem .
shhh !
well , then you got one really big problem .
all right , i' m goin ' to lunch .
hello .
george , it' s special agent tuttle .
hey , how you doin ' ?
we need to talk .
come on .
i just started lunch hour .

all right , fine !
fine !
i did the scrapbooking thing .
big deal !
you' re doing scrapbooking ?
see , that is so cool .
this going straight thing has worked for you .
it' s opened up a myriad of hobbies and interests .
when i got married , we started scrapbooking .
then we took scrapbooking and combined it with genealogy and made books ...
la , la , la , la , la .
you see this ?
this is my " don' t care " face .
now , we' re not here for the scrapbooking thing ?
what are you doin ' here then ?
all right .
agents in atlantic city collared a rocky delfurio on a calling card scam .
do you know him ?
yeah , he' s like , he' s an old timer with gagliano' s crew , right ?
right .
he wanted to cut a deal in exchange for information .
everybody' s a stool pigeon .
he actually had a lot to offer , george .
he lead investigators to an area in the pine barrens .
there were an old farm and well , it had been dried up for years .
there was a concrete slab placed over the top of it .
it was at the bottom of the well ... they found the remains of your father .
i' m so sorry , george .
at the time your father was involved in some importing operation .
a guy named jimmy lanucci tried to muscle in .
your father and lanucci had some words , and one thing lead to another .
lanucci' s been doing a 1 2 to 1 5 on another wrap in tallahassee .
he' s up for parole in six months but he' s not going anywhere now .
the office sent me all of your father' s personal effects to give you .
there' s a gold necklace with a gold crucifix .
a gold ring .
a gold chain with a squiggly thing .
a money clip , no money .
gold , though .
a gold watch .
gold bracelets .
something else gold , i don' t know what that is .

so you got that doctor' s appointment this weekend ?
uh , yeah .
you know , i' m sure it' s nothing to worry about , really .
rick , he told me everything .
he' s concerned .
what are you talking about ?
look , i know it' s a sensitive subject , and i want you to know i feel for you .
i had an uncle who had a colonoscopy .
so ?
look , i want you to know if anything unusual comes up that we are here for you .
look .
i' m not having a colonoscopy .
you' re not ?
no .
you know , george , you' re over 40 .
i mean , this is the time ...
we are not having this discussion !
lgnoring the situation isn' t going to make it actually ...
you know what , i' m sure your doctor ...
all right , you know what ?
i lied .
i made it up .
i got no doctor' s appointment , no colonoscopy , nuthin ' .
i made it up so i wouldn' t have to go out with you into the woods to play army patrol .
happy ?
okay .
you know , rick is really excited .
let me ask you a question .
why do you care about me and my family , huh ?
what is your ...
you get me this job , you bring me to church , you invite us to dinner , and now you inviting me into the woods .
what , you need more converts ?
there aren' t enough mormons in this state ?
no , no , george , it' s not anything like that , really .
i just i consider you a friend .
i want you to feel like part ...
oh no , i do .
i do .
every time we go walkin ' people close their drapes when they see us .
part of the community ?
ah , see , you know , there' s a saying about mormons by mormons , and it says that the church is true , the people aren' t necessarily .
and what does that mean ?
but i suppose you think you' re great ?
no , george , i don' t think anything about myself .
i' m sorry .
i just i just happen to think that you' re a great guy .
you have a great family , and i want you to feel happy here .

i like it though ; i like the granola .
i' il tell you what i' m gonna do .
i' m not gonna shoot you .
but you tell us where your home base is so we can capture your flag and win .
it' s the other side of the hill .
don' t lie to me kid !

my sixth sense tells me when people are lying , especially little kids !
i' m gonna ask you one more time !
where is your home base ?
i' m not lying .

your day' s over .
okay , it' s on the other side of the stream down by the cliffs .

but , i didn' t shoot you , did l ?
let' s go .
hey , what should i do with this ?
leave the gun ; take the granola .
punk .

yeah , i did .
it was great .

naples .
route 45 .
get a big panzorotti .
baked or fried ?
who you talking to ?
deep fried .
remember ?
but you know what ?
i' il bet nobody' s got no naples , and nobody knows nuthin ' about no panzorotti .
lsn' t that a sports car ?
no .
that' s a maserati .
i said panzorotti .
it' s like , picture this .
take a pizza , fold it , throw meat and cheese inside , deep fry it , done .
oh , you mean a calzone ?
no .
no .
look at me .
does it not look like i know the difference between a panzorotti and a calzone ?
maybe i don' t know the difference .
bingo !
nathan .
i' il tell you , today' s your lucky day .
you' re gonna learn .
get me an apron ; i' il show you how to make panzorotti .
i' m gonna show you once , so pay attention .
all right ?
all right .
first thing you do , you turn the dough into crust .
roll it out nice .
make a nice ball .
nice thin crust ; that' s the key .
throw in your red sauce , around the edge , not too much .
you throw in your sausage , your pepperoni , then your ...
what is this ?
a pineapple .
pineapple .
now it' s garbage .
fold it over .
you make your seam .
you throw it in your deep fryer .
nice and brown .
like that , right ?
then you stuff it in your face .
yeah , mike is covered in paint , and we find the kid .
dad makes him tell where his base is .
no loyalty , this kid .
total stool pigeon .
boo hoo , i just want to keep playing the game .
he told us everything .
i would' ve blasted him right off .
you see ?
that' s the problem with kids today .
it' s all about the violence .
be smart .
true coercion is an art form ; it all starts up here .
so we find the flag , we grab it and start booking it for camp .
i' m glad you twos had a good time .
we did , didn' t we ?
yeah .
yeah , i was thinking maybe ... spring comes , it gets a little warmer up in the woods , the three of us , we go , do like a camping weekend .

i don' t think so .
you two go .
i have a house .
why do i wanna go ?

i don' t know .
that' s for me to know and for you to find out .
give to your people the joy of continual health in mind and body with the prayers of the virgin mary to help us .
guide us through the sorrows of this life to eternal happiness in the life to come .
i told you it' s a hi tech world , and we gotta get an lt guy ?
the jamook who every time i got a problem with my computer tells me to turn it off and on .
i get to thinking , that special coffee
carmine always says he can' t live without ...
uh hmh .
i get the computer geek to go on the lnternet and do some research .
there' s a half dozen or so home addresses in the u. s. for somebody ordering that special coffee .
but there' s only one out west just started ordering the same time carmine goes into hiding .
i want you to handle this personally .
already bought the plane tickets .
i' m goin ' .
and i' m bringin ' rocco mancusso with me .
this time tomorrow , carmine pasquale will be a dead man .

you can' t trust nobody .
but it' s perfect .
now we' re spinning a story that they got picked up before they got to you , and you' re completely unaware of this .
lf angelo thinks he' s failed , he' il send somebody else , and that we use as leverage .
of course , he' s gonna send somebody else .
what happens when somebody else gets here ?
we are dead !
george , we' re going to protect you .
right .

living next door to each other .
so each family has a little four year old kid .
one' s a boy ; one' s a girl .
it' s summertime .
the kids are playin ' ; they turn on the sprinkler .
they figure , " eh , we' il strip down to our birthday suits , " right ?
they' re running around .
little boy looks at little girl and goes ,
oh !
look , there really is a difference between mormons and catholics !
all right .

chi trova un amico , trova un tesoro .
which means , " he who finds a friend finds a treasure .
chindan .
chindan .

you know , i' ve never heard a toast at a church dinner before .
that was a first .
well , george is a good guy .
yeah , they' re good people .
according to a spokesman for the fbl , notorious mob figure carmine " the beans " pasquale and his family , known to neighbors as george , linda , and patrick cheeseman , were in the witness protection program for just over a month , when this apparent mob retaliation took place .
lnvestigators say ...
it' s all over the news .
hello .
president perry .
i knew there was something suspicious about them .
what if that explosion had happened when we were nearby ?
it could have been a tragedy !
brothers and sisters ,
i bring you condolences for this incredible tragedy .
you knew this family and their effort to get a second start in life , and i understand many of you here embraced them , as you should , as neighbors .
now , i have other news .
with bishop harrison' s recent loss , he and his family have decided to permanently relocate back east to assist with his parents ' farm .
we therefore need to release bishop john clayton harrison as bishop of the mountain view ward with michael lsaac jaymes as first counselor and kepi vakasiwola viahani as second counselor .
those who can offer a vote of thanks for their service , please join me in doing so .
would the following individual please stand ; as i read his name , we ask for your vote .
as the bishop of the mountain view ward ,
michael lsaac jaymes .
all those who can accept michael jaymes as your bishop , please indicate .
no , i don' t think so pal !
what ?
george , we' re trying to keep a low profile .
i gotta pay for meals in coach .
he says i look like i' m goin ' to a barry manilow concert .
george , you' re in disguise .
keep it low key .
you could have done better on these getups .
it' s temporary .
your plane leaves in 1 5 minutes .
okay .
now , be assured .
angelo marcello thinks you' re dead .
i wish i was dead with these clothes .
you have no imagination .
are you sure nobody suspects a thing ?
no .
everybody has bought this , including your neighbors .
we' ve kept a tight beat on the community and what people are saying .
you might be interested to know your friend , mike jaymes , was called to be the new bishop today .
really ?
well , not for nuthin ' .
he' s good people .
i can see why .
apparently not everybody can .
what do you mean ?
ln the mormon church , when called to any position , everybody in the congregation has to vote on it .
now , 999 times out of 1 000 everybody votes in the affirmative .
what happens on the 1 000th time ?
once in a while people will vote against it .
so , so what ?
somebody didn' t want to vote for mike ?
actually about half the congregation .
what ?
i' ve got to admit , it' s almost unheard of .
how could anyone have anything bad to say about mike ?
we' re here tonight for you to voice your concerns .
i asked brother jaymes not to attend to allow everyone to speak freely .
i have known michael jaymes for years .
we' re not going to find anyone with more dedication .
you know , i think i speak for a lot of people here when i say he may mean well , but at what expense ?
what if one of us had been killed because michael jaymes invited a mobster to wander the halls of our church ?
but he didn' t know .
the federal government sent them here .
there should be a law against that .
or some law notifying us that these people are moving in .
it' s the witness protection program !
lf we know they' re here , they' re not protected .
then who is going to protect us ?
that mobster thug scared my son to death and ate his granola !
exactly .
michael jaymes invited a wolf into our little flock of sheep .
that is the most ridiculous thing i' ve ever heard .
oh !
can i , uh , say somethin ' here ?
thank you .
um , well , we' re not dead .
that little magic show you saw yesterday was courtesy of the fbl .
they did it to trick some people i used to know .
and we' re movin ' away from here now .
but the feds have big ears , and i heard what was going down here with uh ... with mike jaymes and what some of you think about him , that you believe he' s responsible for bringing in a wolf amongst your sheep .
and my life these days has been all about saving my own skin and looking out for number one .
actually , my whole life' s been that way .
but i figured when i heard about this sit down today , it' s a good opportunity for me to stand up for someone who done right by me .
someone like mike .
so ...
i just wrote down some notes .
you know i heard one time that the mormon church is true , but the people ain' t .
i don' t know if the mormon god is the one true god .
i' m not a prayin ' man .
i have heard many people say their prayers .
but i can tell you , if there is one ounce of truth in the mormon church and i relied on the people in this room to find out about it ,
i' d never know .
some of you people wouldn' t give me and my family the time of day .
that aside , you do have one good thing going for ya ,
michael jaymes .
that guy cared more about me and my family than i did .
and he showed me what' s really important in life .
lf he can do that with a guy like me , imagine what he could do with people like you .
so , i don' t know if it counts , but mike jaymes has my vote .
hey !
what , we need an engraved invitation ?
i smell dinner ; i don' t know about you guys .
so , the feds have their undercover guy .
he' s worked in with angelo' s crew , he tells ' em that what went down was real ,
angelo believes we' re dead .
so did everyone else .
it had to be that way .
but when we heard about what happened ...
i hadda come back and say my piece .
so any idea where you' re heading now ?
none .
as long as they don' t put pineapple on their pizza , i' m fine .
and good coffee .
i don' t know .
coffee almost got me killed this time around .
i' m thinking there' s something to this whole mormon health code thing .
oh , hey .
president .
hi .
i wanted to tell you .
what ?
congratulations , bishop .
ha , ha , ha .
everybody sustained me ?
no .
but i never said everybody had to .
all i wanted to know was why they didn' t .
but you' re where you need to be , bishop .
the rest will come around .
look at you .
the mormon jimmy hoffa over here !
lf i were you , just in case you ever disappear ,
leave a note saying to look for you under the goalposts at the b yu stadium .
okay .
he has no idea .
i don' t know if you can write , but if you can , here' s the address to my parents ' home in the philippines .
your brother' s kickin ' you out ?
nah .
i decided i' m going to live with my parents .
it' s sort of trying to find a solution to my problems .
i thought it was a big problem ?
then it might get a little smaller .
oh !
let' s go !
i gotta go .
thanks for everything .
good luck with the baby .
thank you .
all right .
come on , get in .
good luck with everything .
be good .
be safe .
you take care of yourself .
oh , hey .
one more thing .
mike , could you do me a favor ?
yeah , sure .
can you deliver those ?
but , i need you to do it personally .
what are they ?
refund checks .
thanks .
aloha , bishop .
see ya .
take it easy .
bye .
i love these .
