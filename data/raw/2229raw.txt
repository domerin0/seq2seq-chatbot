he' s not gonna knowwhat hit him .
okay , i thinkhe' s probably downstairs .
i' il see you later .
don' t do anythingi wouldn' t do .
there' s nothingyou wouldn' t do .
it' s true .
i thought we weregoing to the party .
well , we can' t arriveon time .
you know, if i didn' t know any better ,
i' d think you brought me hereon purpose .
what ?
i' m offended .
yeah , i' m sure .
do you want to get that ?
definitely not .
no .
it' s okay .
hey , i mean it .
what was that ?
i don' t know .
what is that ?
rich , no !
just wait here .
what the hell ?
rich , let' s go .
aah !
aah !
rich ?
rich ?
rich , where are you ?
okay .
okay .
all right .
thank you for your time .
your half caff double venti vanilla latte is getting cold over here , francis .
byte me .
so , anything ?
i had them check the fbi' s missing persons databank .
no " john does " fitting that description .
i even ran his plates for traffic violations .
i' m telling you , i don' t think dad wants to be found .
check this out .
news item out of plains courier , ankeny , iowa .
it' s about 100 miles from here .
mutilated body was found near the victim' s car parked on 9 mile road .
keep reading .
authorities are unable to provide
a realistic description of the killer .
the sole eyewitness , whose name has been withheld , is quoted as saying the attacker was invisible .
could be something interesting .
it could be nothing .
one witness who didn' t see anything doesn' t mean it' s the invisible man .
but what if it is ?
dad would check it out .
why are we here ?
victim lived here .
nice wheels .
we' re your fraternity brothersfrom ohio .
we' re new in town transfers .
looking for a place to stay .
who are you ?
we' re your new roommates .
do me a favor ? get my back .
big game today .
he' s the artist .
things he can dowith a brush ...
so ... murph , is it true ?
what ?
we heard one of the guys heregot killed last week .
yeah .
what happened ?
they' re saying some psychowith a knife , maybe a drifterpassing through .
rich was a good guy .
rich was with somebody ?
not just somebody lori sorenson .
who' s lori sorenson ?
you missed a spotdown on the back .
lori' s a freshman . she' s a local .
super hot .
and get this she' s a reverend' s daughter .
you wouldn' t happen to knowwhich church , would you ?
our hearts go out to the familyof the young man who perished , and my personal prayersof thanks go out , as well , because i believe he diedtrying to protect my daughter .
and now , as time healsall our wounds , we should reflect onwhat this tragedy means to us as a church . h ...
. as a community, and as a family .
the loss of a young personis particularly tragic .
a life unlived is the saddestof passings .
so , please, let us pray for peace , for guidance , and for the powerto protect our children .
i can' t. it' s sunday night .
it' s just us girls .
we' re gonna do tequila shotsand watch " reality bites .
my dad makes dinnerevery sunday night .
come on , lori .
i know this has been hard , but you are allowedto have fun .
i' il try .
okay .
are you lori ?
yeah .
my name is sam .
this is my brother , dean .
we just transferred hereto the university .
i saw you inside .
we don' t want to bother you . we heard about what happened .
we wanted to sayhow sorry we were .
i kind of knowwhat you' re going through .
i i saw someoneget hurt once .
it' s somethingyou don' t forget .
dad , this is sam and dean . they' re new students .
it' s a pleasure to meet you, sir .
i must say that wasan inspiring sermon .
thank you very much .
it' s so niceto find young people who are opento the lord' s message .
listen , we' re new in town, actually , and we' re looking for a ... tell me , lori, what are the police saying ?
well , they don' t have a lotto go on .
i think they blame mefor that .
what do you mean ?
my story .
i was so scared, i guess i was seeing things .
that doesn' t meanit wasn' t real .
dean : so you believe her ?
i do .
i think she' s hot , too .
no , man , there' s somethingin her eyes .
and listen to this .
she heard scratchingon the roof and found the bloody body suspended upside downover the car .
bloody body suspended ? that sounds like the hookman legend .
that' s one of the most famousurban legends .
you don' t think that we' redealing with the hookman .
every urban legendhas a source , a place where it all began .
what about the scratchesand the tire punctures and the invisible killer ?
maybe the hookmanisn' t a man at all .
what if it' s some kindof spirit ?
here you go .
arrest recordsgoing back to 1851 .
thanks .
okay .
this is how you spent fourgood years of your life , huh ?
welcome to higher education .
hey , check this out .
1862 a preacher named jacob karnswas arrested for murder .
he was so angry overthe red light district in town that one nighthe killed 13 prostitutes .
some of the deceasedwere found in their beds ,
sheets soaked with blood ,
others suspended upside downfrom the limbs of trees as a warning against sinsof the flesh .
get this the murder weapon ?
looks like the preacherlost his hand in an accident , had it replacedwith a silver hook .
look whereall this happened .
9 mile road .
same place where the frat boywas killed .
nice job , dr .
venkman .
let' s check it out .
i know this is your first timereally living alone since mom died .
that' s not it . i worry about you .
there are 22 girls in there . i' m perfectly safe .
that' s whatl' m worried about .
you don' t think i knowwhat goes on in there ?
dad , do we have to havethis argument again ?
i' m over 18 . i can live my own life .
which means partyingwith that roommate of yours .
i' m an adult . i can take care of myself .
good night .
lori . lori , come
lori .
taylor , are you awake ?
here you go .
if it is a spirit, buckshot won' t do much good .
yeah .
rock salt .
hmm .
salt beinga spirit deterrent .
yeah .
it won' t kill ' em, but it' il slow ' em down .
that' s pretty good . you and dad think of this ?
i told you , you don' t have to be a collegegraduate to be a genius .
over there , over there .
put the gun down now ! now !
hands behind your head !
wait , wait , wait ! okay , okay .
get down on your knees ! come on , do it !
on your knees .
get down on your bellies . come on , do it .
he had the gun .
oh , my god !
saved your ass .
talked the sheriff downto a fine , dude .
i' m matlock . but how ?
told him you werea dumb ass pledge and that we were hazing you .
what about the shotgun ?
i said that you werehunting ghosts and that spiritsare repelled by rock salt .
you know, typical hell week prank .
and he believed you ?
well , you look likea dumb ass pledge .
i just wantto take her home .
i understand , reverend , but lori' s now connectedto two murders and i can' t ignore that .
listen to me .
arrest her nowor let me take her home .
make sure she' s availablefor questioning .
thank you .
why would the hookmanhave come here ?
this is a long wayfrom 9 mile road .
maybe he' s not hauntingthe scene of his crime .
maybe it' s aboutsomething else .
dude , sorority girls .
think we' il seea naked pillow fight ?
try and be quiet, will you ?
me be quiet ? you be quiet .
aren' t you gladyou didn' t turn on the light ?
that' s right outof the legend .
yeah , that' s classic hookman, all right .
it' s definitely a spirit .
yeah .
i' ve never smelled ozonethis strong before .
hey , come here .
does that look familiarto you ?
it' s the same symbol .
seems like it is the spiritof jacob karns .
let' s findthe dude' s grave , salt and burn the bones, and put him down .
after execution, jacob karns was laid to rest in old north cemeteryin an unmarked grave .
super .
okay , so, we know it' s jacob karns , but we still don' t knowwhere he' il manifest next .
or why .
i' il take a wild guessabout why .
i think your friend lorihas something to do with this .
you' ve been holding outon me .
this college thingis awesome !
this wasn' t reallymy experience .
let me guess
library , studying, straight as .
what a geek .
did you do your homework ?
yeah , it was bugging me .
how is the hookman tiedwith lori ?
i think i came upwith something .
1932 " clergyman arrestedfor murder .
1967 " seminarian heldin hippie rampage .
there' s a pattern here .
in both cases , the suspectwas a man of religion who openly preachedagainst immorality and then found himselfwanted for killings he claimed were the workof an invisible force , killings carried out get this with a sharp instrument .
what' s the connectionto lori ?
a man of religion who openlypreaches against immorality .
except this time insteadof saving the whole town , he' s trying to savehis only daughter .
reverend sorenson .
do you thinkhe' s summoning the spirit ?
maybe .
or you knowhow a poltergeist can haunt a person insteadof a place ?
the spirit latches onto thereverend' s repressed emotions , feeds off them .
without the reverendever even knowing it .
either way , you should keepan eye on lori tonight .
what about you ?
i' m gonna go see if i can findthat unmarked grave .
here we go .
that' s it .
next time , i get to watchthe cute girl' s house .
hello , preacher .
i saw you from upstairs .
what are you doing here ?
i' m keeping an eyeon the place .
i was worried .
about me ?
yeah , sorry .
no , it' s cool .
i already called the cops .
no , seriously, i think you' re sweet , which is probably whyyou should run away from me as fast as you can .
why would you say that ?
it' s like i' m cursedor something .
people around mekeep dying .
i thinki know how you feel .
goodbye , preacher .
no one willtalk to me anymore ... except you .
the sheriff thinksl' m a suspect .
and you knowwhat my dad will say ?
pave faith .
what does he knowabout faith ?
i heard you guysfighting before .
he' s seeing a woman, a married woman .
i just found out .
she comes to our churchwith her husband ,
i know her kids , and he talks to me aboutreligion , about morality ?
it' s like on one hand, you know , just do what you wantand be happy , but he taught me raised me to believe thatif you do something wrong , you will get punished .
i just don' t knowwhat to think anymore .
sam ?
lori , i can' t.
that someone you lost ?
i' m sorry .
lori .
come inside , please .
i' il come inwhen i' m ready .
ack !
aah !
no !
no !
dad !
it' s okay . it' s all right .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
we were just talking .
then lori' s dad came out, and then he appeared .
a big man carryinga weapon , some kind of a hook ?
yes , sir .
ever seen him before ?
no , sir .
son , it seems every timei turn around , i' m seeing you .
i suggest you tryto stay out of trouble .
yes , sir .
it' s all right . i' m with him .
that' s my brother . hey , brother .
let him through .
thanks .
go ahead .
you okay ?
yeah .
what the hell happened ?
hookman .
you saw him ?
damn right .
why didn' t you torchthe bones ?
i did .
are you sure it' sthe spirit of jacob karns ?
sure as hell looked like him . and that' s not all .
i don' t think the spiritis latching onto the reverend .
yeah , the guy wouldn' t sendthe hookman after himself .
i thinkit' s latching onto lori .
last night she found outthat her father is having an affairwith a married woman .
so what ?
so , she' s upset about it .
she' s upset aboutthe immorality of it .
she was raised to believe that if you do somethingwrong , you get punished .
okay , so shehe' s conflicted , and the spiritof preacher karns is latching ontoher emotions and doingthe punishing for her .
right .
rich comes on too strong .
taylor tries to make herinto a party girl .
dad has an affair .
remind me not to pissthis girl off .
but i burned those bones . i buried them in salt .
why didn' t that stop him ?
you must' ve missedsomething .
no , i burned everythingin that coffin .
did you get the hook ?
the hook ?
it was the murder weapon , and in a wayit was part of him .
so , like the bones , the hook is a sourceof his power .
so , if we find the hook ... both : we stop the hookman .
here' s something, i think .
logbook, iowa state penitentiary .
karns , jacob personal affects, disposition thereof .
does it mention the hook ?
upon execution , all earthlyitems shall be remanded
to the prisoner' s houseof worship , st .
barnabas church .
isn' t that where lori' sfather preaches ?
yeah .
where lori lives ?
that' s why the hookman' sbeen haunting reverends and reverends ' daughtersfor the past 200 years .
but if the hook were atthe church or lori' s house , don' t you think someonemight' ve seen it ?
i mean , a blood stained, silver handled hook ?
check the church records .
st. barnabas donations, 1862 .
received silver handled hook
from state penitentiary .
reforged .
they melted it down, made it into something else .
all right . we can' t take any chances .
anything silvergoes in the fire .
i agree .
lori' s still atthe hospital .
we' il have to break in .
all right, take your pick .
i' il take the house .
okay .
hey .
stay out of herunderwear drawer .
i got everythingthat even looks silver .
better safe than sorry .
move , move .
lori ?
what are you doing here ?
what is it ?
i' ve been trying to understandwhat' s been happening , why .
now i know , so i' m prayingfor forgiveness .
forgiveness for what ?
don' t you see ?
i' m to blame for all this .
i' ve read in the bibleabout avenging angels .
trust me .
this guy he' s no angel .
i was so angry atmy father .
part of me wanted himpunished , and then he cameand he punished him .
it' s not your fault .
yes , it is .
i don' t know how, but it is .
i killed rich .
taylor , too .
i nearly killed my father .
lori .
i can see it now .
they didn' t deserveto be punished .
i do .
come on . we got to go .
go !
come on !
no !
come on , get up .
sam , drop !
i thoughtwe got all the silver .
why is he still here ?
maybe we missed something .
lori , where did you getthat chain ?
my father gave it to me .
where' d your dad get it ?
it was a church heirloom . he gave it to me .
is it silver ?
yes .
sam .
and you saw him , too, the man with the hook ?
yes , i told you . we all saw him .
we fought him off, and then he ran .
and that' s all ?
yeah , that' s all .
listen, you and your brother oh , don' t worry . we' re leaving town .
you gonna be okay ?
yeah .
i still don' t knowwhat happened , but i do knowyou saved my life .
my father' s , too .
thank you .
we could stay .
