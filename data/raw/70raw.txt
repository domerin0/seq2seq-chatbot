i was married , my wife hated me being a firefighter , we got divorced nine months later .
you' re different , you are a good father , you worry .
but you should worry .
you know , maybe it' s time for a change of your scenery ?
i was thinking there' s a job down at headquarters , head position , do you like me to put your name in for ?
are you saying i ain' t go to the firehouse ?
well , i' m saying that you should ask yourself that question .
maybe go home talk to linda .
you know , be honest with yourself ?
nothing wrong with moving on .
i did it .
so what did he say ?
mike may have me transferred .

i' il be home nights .
70 cents an hour increase to pay .
is that what you want ?
i don' t know .
it' s been so crazy lately .
you know , our kids are scared .
i see you upset and ... that' s terrible .

we' re married ten years , when you do this , it' s hard for me sometimes .
and i do get scared .
but i deal with it .
i' m proud of you .

and the first time in my life .

mike ?
tell linda i love her .
that i loved her from second i saw her .
do you hear me ?
yeah , i hear you .
promise to take care of my kids .
tell them that i' il be always with them .
you tell them that , do you hear me ?
i will .
command all units evacuate building immediately .
all units reporting clear , the building is clear , we' re all out .
copy that .
it' s never an easy thing .
saying good bye to a brother firefighter .
and this time is particularly difficult for me because i watched jack growing to a one of the finest firefighters i' ve ever known .
he joined this department because he wanted to help people .
who knows how many homes is still standing because jack was there .
how many lives were spared .
he gave his life for that cause .
we' il never forget you , jack .
and we are better for ever knowing you .
but i make you this one promise , tomorrow we will be back on the truck .
because you was the bravest of the brave .
how is it that firefighters run to a burning building , when everyone else is running out ?
jack , he would answer that question by saving another man' s life .
your courage is the answer .
and today we will be as brave as you .
i' m not mourning you , i' m celebrating your life .
so i' d like everyone to stand up and celebrate the life of jack morrison .
