you were very good this afternoon , david .
thank you .
he can play better .
well , maybe he was a little too good .
some people don' t like that .
we , uh , we gave him a special prize for his courage .
difficult piece you chose , david .
daddy chose it .
well , even great pianists think twice ... before tackling the polonaise .
a prize for losing .
i wouldn' t call him a loser .
they all ... they all play .
well , i' m quite sure ...
david could win lots of competitions ... with the right tuition .
my card .
i teach him .
yeah .
you' ve obviously done very well .
yeah .
no one taught me .
no music teachers , mr. rosen .
no , of course .
it' s just , uh ... it' s just a few bad habits ... can sometimes mean the difference between winning ... or losing .
well , perhaps you' d , uh , you' d like to think about it , hmm ?
it' s rachmaninoff .
it' s beautiful .
yeah .
you taught yourself ?
from the record .
ah , yeah .
it' s ... it' s very difficult .
it' s very difficult .
it' s ... it' s the hardest piece in the world , you know ?

schubert .
nothing wrong with schubert , of course except syphilis .
was it syphilis ?
i think it was .
and then he got typhoid on top of that , so that was the end of him .
we lost him .

we lost him ...

oh , jim , jim , jim , i' ve been a naughty boy .
was i a naughty boy ?
i was about to send out a search party .

you can ride in my cadillac .
where are you going to live in america ?
with a nice jewish family , they said .
this is not a nice family ?
yes , daddy .
it' s ... very nice .
you' re very lucky to have a family , david .
i' ve got to go .
it' s one of the finest music schools in the world .
it is for his father to decide .
he would be well looked after , i assure you .
rachel , please .
david could be one of the truly great pianists .
he is just a boy , mr. rosen .
he still wets his bed .
you see how fit i am ?
how strong ?

they think they are so important .
what do they know with their furs and their diamonds ?
it makes me sick ... to the stomach .
and rosen .
what kind of man is he ?
he is not married .
he has no children .
don' t talk to me about rosen .
he only wants for david ... the same as you have always wanted .
don' t ever compare me to him .
what has he suffered ?
not a day in his life .
what does he know ?
does he know about families ?
about ... how your sisters died ?
and my mother and father ?

you disgusting animal !
i know you can hear me .
don' t do this to david .
you mustn' t stop him going .
whatever you do , don' t you dare inflict bloody rachmaninoff on him .
he' s not ready !
david ... my boy .
it' s a terrible thing ... to hate your father .
you know , life is cruel , but ... but music ... music , it will always ... always be your friend .
everything else ... will let you down .
ln the end , everything , believe me , everything .
don' t hate me .
life is cruel .
but you have ... you have to ... you have to survive .
you have to survive .

you have to survive , daddy .
you have to survive .
no one ... will love you like me .
you can' t trust anyone .
but i will always ... be there .
i will always be with you .
forever and ever .
forever and ever , daddy .
each time you play for me , it expresses so completely the ... inexpressible .
is that good ?
it' s divine .
lnexpressibly divine .
quite .
tell me a story , katharine .
what' s the story today ?
a new story .
drops of water ?
ah ... raindrops .
yes , raindrops .
perfect .
i shall treasure this till the day i die .
to you , all these wild weeds ...
and wind flowers of my life ...
i bring , my lord ,
and lay them at your feet .
they' re not frankincense or myrrh ,
but you are krishna , christ , and dionysus ...
in your beauty , tenderness , and strength .
that was our final contestant david helfgott ... with a very stirring rachmaninoff .
well , what a close contest we have , with the national championship ... almost certain to go to one of the two pianists .
bravo , david .
i dare say it' s going to be difficult for the judges ... to separate them , either one a worthy winner .
the judges are now conferring .
it' s a tough game , isn' t it , roger ?
it' s a blood sport .
ladies and gentlemen ...
i' m pleased to announce the winner ... of this year' s instrumental and vocal competition .
our new national champion is ...
roger woodward .
what was he like , katharine ?
your father .
he was forever busy in his study .
go away , kattie , i' m writing , " he' d always say .
one day oh , i was very young
i got so annoyed ... that i upset the ink pots all over his desk ... and scrawled on his work .
pages of it .
when he saw it , he just stood there seething with anger .
i could feel it .
what are you doing ? " he shouted .
well , there was this terrible silence ... and i just stared at him and said ,
go away , daddy .
i' m writing .
he ran at me and he picked me up ... and he cuddled me breathless .
my first literary effort , he always called it .
david , what is it ?
royal college of music .
a scholarship .
oh , david , that' s marvelous .
daddy won' t cuddle me , katharine .
oh , no .
he can' t stop you , david .
he' s such an angry lion , katharine .
oh , nonsense .
he' s a pussycat .
i' il miss you .
these were for my son , but you better have them .
it gets very , very cold in london .
where have you been ?
i missed the train .
that prichard woman .
what is this ?
the gloves .
look at me .
look at me !
and you think you can just do as you please ?
i i want to go , and you can' t stop me .
but ...
i' m your father ... who has done everything for you .
everything !
you cruel , callous boy !
mum !
margaret !
stupid !
stupid
leave him .
leave him !
leave him alone .
go , go !
go !
you want to go , go !
i' il call the police !
go !
go !
stop it !
yeah , all right .
leave him .
he' s all right .
are you all right , david ?
are you all right ?
yeah ?
come on , david .
he' s all right .
i' m old enough to make up my own mind .
he thinks he' s going to london .
i' ve been accepted into the royal college of music .
what do you think is going to happen to you in london ?
david ... if you go ... you will never come back into this house again .
you will never be anybody' s son .
the girls will lose a brother .
is that what you want ?
you want ... you want to destroy your family ?
i' m i' m sorry .
david , if you love me , you will stop this nonsense .
you will not step out that door .
david .
if you go , you will be punished ... for the rest of your life .
my david .
don' t go .
david !
don' t make me do it !
he has the most fantastic hands .
not connected to anything above his shoulders .
oh , he' s a bit fragile , certainly .
chopinzee .
i' ve seen enough to suggest ... that he can make the finals in the concerto trials .
what have you seen , cecil ?
moments of genius .
genius ?
really .
come on , david .
boldness of attack .
diablerie .
the devil , david .
mustn' t break the piano .
liszt broke plenty of strings .
right .
right .
come on .
fill in for this useless arm of mine .
the notes first .
the interpretation comes on top of them .
on top , yes .
yes .
you agree , do you ?
oh , yes .
i always agree , professor .
is that wise ?
i i don' t know .
is it ?
don' t forget .
it' s on the page .
yes .
well , the ... the notes are on the page , but , uh , not the feeling , the emotion .
that' s what i feel .
you mustn' t sacrifice everything to emotion .
it' s all a question of balance .
ah , yes . ls that the question , professor ?
precisely .
ah .
i thought so .
that' s what i thought .
mr. helfgott !
your allowance check !
thank you , mr. right .
sorry .
sorry .
sorry .
i' il just stand still if you like .
be careful , david .
oh , by all means , sarah .
you look lovely today , sarah .
thank you , david .
you , too , muriel .
ease up , helfgott .
sarah !
david !
you missed the bank .
pity .
you' il have to wait until tomorrow .
can' t bank on the bank .
we know someone who can cash it .
do we , robert ?
what are friends for ?
got to concentrate .
got to concentrate , katharine .
got to practice , practice , practice , because there' s 3 important things professor parkes says , and that' s work , work , work .
and and , uh , so that' s what i have to do ... if i' m , uh , going to make the finals to the concerto medal , because the winner , which gets to play at the royal albert hall , which is right outside the window .
i i bought a piano , katharine .
a beautiful piano .
it' s a suffering piano , like yours .
i i wrote to daddy , so , uh , that' s a positive .
it' s a positive , isn' t it ?
because , well , it seems to be , because he didn' t write back , but , um , uh ...
now , how on earth ... did we manage to get into the finals , david ?
you' re a conductor' s nightmare .
it' s true , it' s true .
and what are we going to do ?
we' re going to win , actually , robert .
we' re going to win .
rachmaninoff ?
are you sure ?
uh , kind of .
i' m never really sure about anything , mr. parkes .
the rach 3 .
it' s monumental !
it' s a mountain .
it' s the hardest piece you could everest play .
well , no one' s ever been mad enough to attempt the rach 3 .
am i ... mad enough , professor ?
am i ?
think of it as two separate melodies jousting for supremacy .
the hands , giants ten fingers each .
performing' s a risk , you know no safety net .
make no mistake , david .
it' s dangerous .
people get hurt .
you have to learn to be able to play it blindfolded .
the page , for god' s sake !
the notes !
i' m sorry .
i was , uh , forgetting them , professor .
would it be asking too much to learn them first ?
and and then forget them ?
precisely .
just give me the fingering .
david .
come on , my boy .
we' re going to rest muscles and fingers today ... and try to exercise the imagination .
first movement cadenza .
let' s pick it up from , uh ...
your hands must form the unbreakable habit ... of playing the notes , so that you can forget all about them ... and let it come from here .
the heart ... that' s where it comes from .
don' t you just love those big , fat chords ?
you have to tame the piano , david , or it' il get away from you .
it' s a monster .
tame it , or it' il swallow you whole .
coming along nicely , david .
morning , mrs. perkins .
i call this my little mausoleum , david .
ah , liszt warts and all .
they made this after he was dead .
poor franz .
dead as a post , eh ?
you can still get these on the left bank , you know .
quite cheap .
i' ve got rachmaninoff in here somewhere .
magnificent fingers .
so virile .
you know , i ... played the rach 3 for him once .
really ?
yes .
he said he could hear himself in my playing .
he said it seemed ... as if i had touched his soul .
that wasn' t so bad , was it ?
not too bad at all , professor .
now it' s your turn , david .
remember ... once you' ve done it , nobody can ever take it away from you .
and you must play ... as if there was no tomorrow .
come on , david , don' t let me down .
how many moments of genius today , cecil ?
hello ?
who is this ?
hello ?
daddy ?
daddy , i' m home .
daddy ?
hello ?

not not so often , sweet sweet , soft suzie .
not so often .
i' m going to live in melbourne .
oh , that' s a trick .
don' t tell daddy .
the milk the milk mustn' t cry over spilt milk .
oh , well , what can you do , margaret ?
what can you do ?
margaret' s in lsrael , remember ?
i remember margaret .
she called me dopey .
or was it a pig ?
it was the poodle .
it was the poodle .
it was the poodle .
it was all very complicated , wasn' t it ?
