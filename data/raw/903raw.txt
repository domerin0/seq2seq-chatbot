that' s great .
can you get me some more of them ?
you get to the point .
and you skirt it .
can you get me the pills ?
yes .
well , then let' s get that prescription pad out .
roy , i don' t prescribe medicine unless i' ve chatted with the patient .
if you' re inclined against that , this session will be quite brief .
would you like to tell me what' s been bothering you ?
i don' t like being outdoors , which i know is called " agoraphobia . " right ?
incorrectly .
but , yes .
anything else ?
dirt .
especially around moldings .
i don' t like when people put shoes on my carpet .
obviously , i have a lot of tics .
i find that very frustrating .
certain things distract me , make me feel sick to my stomach .
have these distractions affected your work of late ?
and your personal relationships ?
what personal relationships ?
when was the last time you were in one ?
with a woman ?
a long time ago .
five years ?
ten years ?
keep going , man .
what was her name ?
heather .
were you married ?
kids ?
maybe .
you haven' t seen her since ?
she left me with a black eye , which i gave her , and a bun in the oven ... ... which might' ve come from anyone .
so , no , i haven' t .
look , doc , i spent last tuesday watching fibers on my carpet .
and the whole time i was watching my carpet , i was worrying that i might vomit .
i was thinking , " i' m a grown man .
i should know what goes on in my head .
the more i thought about it ... ... the more i realized i should blow my brains out and end it all .
but if i thought more about blowing my brains out ... ... i started worrying about what that would do to my goddamn carpet .
so that was a good day , doc .
and i just want you to give me some pills and let me get on with my life .
roy .

you know , what could have been , what might have been .
and the baby ?

to the business at hand .
i have one rule , chuck .
simple is safe .
i' il tell you as little as possible about what i do ... ... but as much as i need to to make you comfortable with what we' re doing .
what are we doing ?
five thousand pounds sterling .
a perk of working in exchange at a bank .
whose is it ?
no one' s .
just money unaccounted for , floating on top of the books like a layer of cream .
and he just scoops it off .
well , it' s a little more ...
bob !
it' s a little more complicated than that , but again , simple is safe .
why not keep it yourself ?
as a bank employee , any attempt to change currency is recorded and questioned .
bob has a record .
you , on the other hand , no one bats an eye .
now , i hope you have something for me .
five grand , american .
congratulations .
at today' s exchange rate you just made ...
$2567 .

i can' t figure it out .
me neither , but my daughter' s a wiz .
you have a daughter ?
two .
fifteen and 12 .
wonderful , i have a 14 year old .
it' s a riot , huh ?
little training bras hanging from the shower rods .
yeah , and everything smells like gum .
how do you get them outside ?
mine sits at home all day .

angela , listen , i' m glad i met you , i really am , but i' ve got a business ... ... and i' ve got a partner and i' ve got things a certain way , and that' s it !
so , you know , i think it' d be better ... ... for you , most of all , if tomorrow morning i took you back home .
what did i do wrong ?
you didn' t do anything wrong .
i just went out !
god , i didn' t even ...
i didn' t drink , i didn' t get high !
i didn' t take any money from your stupid dog !
what , you never heard of a bank ?
that is wrong what you did , and ... ... you' re a nosy parker , and ...
and that' s no way for a young lady to behave !
shame on you !
angela ?
sweetheart ?
i wasn' t kicking you out .
i don' t wanna stay where i' m not wanted !
it' s not that i don' t want you .
fooled me .
will you stop ?
don' t !
let me go !
you just don' t want me going home to mom thinking she was right all along !
stop !
you' re just like one of her boyfriends !
i' m just something you have to deal with in order to screw her !
please , you know that' s not true .
even they tell me what they do for a living !
antiques dealers always keep large stacks of cash in their homes next to their guns .
okay .
okay .
all right ?
i' m sorry .
it' s just ...
i' m not ...
i' m not very good at being a dad .
okay ?
you know ?
all right ?
i barely get by being me .
sweetheart , please ...
don' t !
come on back home with me , and we can get a big pizza again .
you can stay the whole weekend if you want , all right ?
why do you have a gun ?
in case .
in case what ?
it' s hard to explain .
waller .
keep the change .
bullshit !
nope .
no bullshit .
and watch your language at the table .
you' re a con man ?
con artist .
a flimflam man , matchstick man , loser .
whatever you want to call it .
and that guy , frank ?
he' s my partner .
my protg .
teach me something .
what ?
teach me a con .
you' re funny .
no , come on , really !
teach me something .
i' m not teaching you anything .
why not ?
you' re a bright , innocent , beautiful girl ... ... and i' m not gonna screw that up like everything else .
really ?
what ?
you think that ?
that i' m beautiful ?
no .
then why won' t you ?
because crime doesn' t pay ?
no , it does .
it does .
just not very well .
you seem to be doing okay .
i' m not .
believe me , it' s no fun doing what i do .
it' s usually stealing from people who don' t deserve it .
old people , fat people .
lonely .
a lot of the time , i feel sick about it .
then why do you do it ?
i' m not as innocent as you think .
i' ve done stuff with boys .
i' ve done stuff with boys , if i told you ... ... you' d throw up .
then don' t tell me .
then teach me something !
no !
final .
at the christmas dance last year , i went with this boy josh ward .
he' s cute , and i really liked him .
i' m not listening .
after the dance , we went to carrie' s , and he pushed me against the bed ...
not listening ! ... and he took his hand ...
no !
okay .
i' il show you one thing !
you will ?
thank you , thank you !
all right , okay ...
thank you !
but then you' re never gonna do it again , and you' re gonna forget it .
agreed ?
holy mary .
never work near where you live .
don' t shit ...
don' t write anything down .
all right , i want you to stay in the car , okay ?
hey !
would you stay in the car ?
i' d like to play this for the drawing on the 22nd .
you know the odds of the same numbers hitting in the same month ?
or ever ?
well , that' s why i changed one .
you' re wasting your dollar .
hey .
you his financial adviser ?
no .
you' re a cashier at a convenience store .
take his dollar and give him a ticket .
you' re ready for this .
i was born ready .
glad i missed that day .
the most important thing to understand about this game is ... ... ninety percent of it is variable .
no matter how good a plan is , you almost always get thrown a curve .
so you gotta be flexible , prepared to roll with anything .
i' il do it .
just the 2 .
the one thing you can control , though , is who your mark is .
