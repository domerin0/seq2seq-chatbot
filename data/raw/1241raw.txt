this is the heart of it .
jungle .
damu headquarters .
stoners .
a lot of murder investigations lead here .
one way in , one way out .
thought we were going to eat .
don' t ever come here without me .
i' m serious .
for your safety .
how' d you get a golden pass ?
i treat them fair .
they know if they cross the line , i tax that ass .
what' s that , up there ?
they flipping pigeons to signal i' m here .
what' s up , bone ?
what' s up ?
what' s up ?
it' s all good .
i appreciate what you did for my nephew .
for sure .
for sure .
