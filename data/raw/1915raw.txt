master , who' s bernardo gui ?
i' ve been searching the entire abbey for you !
michele wishes to speak with you at once .
alone .
you know who' s coming ?
i know .
bernardo gui .
ubertino must be moved to a safe place .
the arrangements have been made .
it' s you that concerns us .
you must put aside these totally irrelevant investigations .
erroneous conclusions .
it' s the truth .
i' m right .
william' s right , he' s always right !
no matter what the consequences ... for himself or anyone else ...
william of baskerville ... must always prove himself right .
wasn' t your vanity , your intellectual pride ... that brought you into conflict with bernardo gui before ?
do not dare fate twice , william .
not even the emperor will be able to save you if you tangle with bernardo .
my flesh' d forgotten the sinfulpleasure she' d ... given me .
but mysoul couldn' t forget her .
and now ?
now that lsaw herin the midst ofherpovertyandsquatter ...
ipraised god that i was a franciscan .
i wanted her to know that i didn' t belong to ... this abbeybut to an orderdedicated to lifting ... herpeople out of theirphysical destitution # .
andspiritual depravation .
farewell william .
you' re mad and arrogant .
but i love you and i' il never cease to pray for you .
goodbye , dear child .
try not to learn too many bad examples from your master .
he thinks too much .
relying always on the ... deductions of his head .
instead oftrusting in the prophetic capacities ... of his heart .
learn to mortify your ... intelligence .
weep over the wounds of our lord ... and do throw away those books !
there' s a side of ubertino i truly envy .
remember , fear the last trumpet , my friends .
the next' il fall from the sky .
and then will come a thousand ...
scorpions .
yes , we won' t forget .
which one frightens you most ?
they all do .
look closely .
that one .
my choice exactly .
after you .
those are the foundations ofthe tower .
but how to reach the library ?
the rats love parchment even more than scholars do .
let' s follow him .
1 66 , bolted door , 1 67 ... 1 68 , 1 69 , 1 70 ...
i knew it .
adso !
i knew it !
you realize ... we' re in one ofthe greatest libraries in the whole christendom ?
how are we gonna find the book ?
ln time .
the beatus of liebana " .
that' s a masterpiece .
and this is the version anoted by umberto de bologna !
how many more rooms ?
how many more books ?
no one should be forbidden to consult these books .
perhaps they' re thought to be too precious , too fragile .
it' s not that , adso .
they contain a wisdom that' s different from ours ... and ideas that could make us doubt ... the infallibility ofthe word of god .
master ?
and doubt , adso , is the enemy offaith .
master ?
master ?
master ?
wait for me !
i' m waiting foryou .
but i can hear you walking .
i' m not walking .
i' m down here .
is that you up there ?
where are you ?
i' m lost !
well , adso , it' d appear we' re in a labyrinth .
are you still there ?
yes .
how do we get out ?
with some difficulty .
at least .
you see , adso , that' s the charm of a labyrinth .
adso , staycalm .
open a book ... read it aloud .
leave the room you' re in ... keep turning left .
love' s not originated as a trouble but it transforms into it ... " when it becomes obsessive cause .
it was lb hazm who said the love sickperson ... " " doesn' t want to be healed and his amorous reverie ... " " cause irregularbreathing and quickpulse .
he identifies amorous melancholy with lincantropy ... " " the disease that induces woof like behavior in humans .
the external appearance ... " " begins to change .
soon the eyes fail , his lips dry ... " " his face becomes postuled .
marks resembling bites of the dog appear in his face ... " " he ends his days by prowling in the graveyards ... " " at night , like a wolf .
master ?
i see a lantern .
don' t move .
stay where you are .
i see a man .
he' s stopped .
what' s he doing ?
he' s raising his lantern .
how many times ?
three times .
it' s l .
raise your lantern .
look !
you foolish boy !
it' s just a mirror .
master !
save the books .
i' m trying to save you !
a trap door , a mirror ...
we' re almost there .
if i' ve deciphered the instructions ofthe translator correctly ...
you didn' t think me so foolish as to surrender ... the parchment to the abbot without making a copy , right ?
with the hand above the idol ...
press the 1o . and the 7o . of four '
very good .
what idol ?
that' s what we' re here to find out .
the 1o . and the 7o . of four what ?
if i knew the answer of everything i' d teach theology in paris .
and ... again .
you hear that ?
it' s my teeth , master .
what ?
my teeth .
don' t be afraid .
i' m not afraid , i' m cold .
well ... we should return .
don' t leave for my account .
i confess it deludes me for the moment
well ...
iet me see ... to find the way out of a labyrinth ... you come to a fork mark it with an arrow ...
master .
please !
i' m thinking .
ifthere are arrows at the forks , then ...
well done , boy !
your classical education serves us well !
give it to me .
give me !
bernardo , sprinkle me with the sperm .
then , you have the love .
spit it , please .
spit it over there .
thank you .
lucifer , be at my service , for a woman' s love .
leave me !
leave me !
it' s burning !
bernardo , look what we found .
search the creature .
mr. abbot , you invited me to investigate ... the presence ofthe evil one in your abbey ... and i already found it .
how many times have i seen these objects of devil worship ?
the black cock and the black cat !
she did it for the food , not for the devil !
william de baskerville must recall the trial ... in which a woman confessed to have had intercourse ... with the demon in the form of a black cat .
you don' t have draw on my past experiences ... to formulate your conclusions .
no indeed .
not in the face of irrefutable evidences .
a witch !
a seduced monk !
satanic rite !
tomorrow we shall learn ifthese events ... are connected with the mystery that afflicts your abbey .
lock them up !
so they' il sleep safely tonight .
you said nothing !
i said nothing because there was nothing to be said .
you' re ready enough to speak the truth ... when it comes to books and ideas .
she' s already burned flesh , adso .
bernardo gui' s spoken .
she' s a witch .
it' s not true and you know it !
i know .
i also know that anyone who disputes the verdict ... of an inquisitor is guilty of heresy .
you seem to know a lot about it .
oh , yes .
won' t you tell me ... as a friend ?
there' s not much to tell .
i was an inquisitor , but in the early days ... when the lnquisition struggled to guide , no to punish .
once , i had to preside the trial of a man ... whose only crime was to have translated a greek book ... that conflicted with the holly scriptures .
bernardo gui wanted to condemn him as heretic .
i acquitted the man .
gui accused me of heresy for having defended him .
i appealed to the pope .
i was brought to prison ... tortured ...
and i recanted .
what happened then ?
the man was burnt at stake ... and i' m still alive .
brother salvatore ...
this torment causes me as much pain as you .
you can end it before we even begin .
open the gates ofyour heart , search the depths ofyour soul .
search !
i' m searching , sir .
then tell me ... who , among your brethren , is the heretic responsible for these murders ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know !
i know nothing !
stupid .
i don' t know anything .
did i lie awake that night , suffering for the girl ... or formyself ?
i did not know .
with the dawn , came the emissaries ofthe pope ... our adversaries ofthe debate .
but it meant so little to me now .
your eminence , venerable brothers ... at last we meet for this long waiting debate !
we' ve all traveled great distances ... to put an end to the dispute ... that has shaken the unity ... of our holly mother church .
good people throughout christendom ... are directing their gazes at these venerable walls ... anxiously awaiting our answer to that question ...
did christ or did he not owe ... the clothes that he wore ?
beloved brethren of the franciscan order ... our holly father , the pope , has authorized me ... and these servants to speak on his behalf .
the question' s not whether christ was poor ...
but whether the church should be poor !
you , franciscans , wish to see ... the clergy renounce its possessions ... andsurrenderits richness .
the abbots dissipated theirsacred treasures ... and handed their fertile land to the servs .
i found the book .
i found the book at the dispensary .
a book in greek .
it' s behind one of myjars .
don' t touch it .
return , lock yourself inside .
i' il be there as soon as i can .
... defying the church on the resources needed to combat the eager ... great flow ofthe infident .
you forget that even the greatest monument to ourlord ... is a pale reflex of his infinite majestyand glory .
brother , quick !
salvatore confessed his heretic past ... and yours .
you have little to escape from the flames .
thank you , brother .
i consider this an absurd !
i can' tstand it !
how dare you call the pope' s brothel god' s palace on earth ?
answer that , your eminence !
these murders are a sign .
i don' t believe it !
why not ?
gospel speaks categorically ... that christ possessed a purse !
it' s a lie , and you know it !
why did our lord tell his disciples on seven occasions ... not to carry neither gold nor silver ?
you , please !
a matter' s occurred of utmost gravity .
let me go !
i swear i didn' t kill him !
i was in the barn making the inventory .
i neverkilled anybody , i swear it !
then explain us why you were escaping .
i wasn' t .
i' ve already ordered your arrest in another choice .
i see now that i was correct .
if someone hadn' t chosen to look in the wrong direction ... many men of god would still be with us .
hand above the idol , 1 and 7 . of four ...
use vulgar persons .
take pleasure from the defects .
please , dear boy , i' m trying to think .
so am i , master .
then use your head instead ofyour heart .
and we can make some progress .
are the books more important than people to you ?
did i say they were ?
you never seem to care about anyone !
can' t you show a little pity ?
perhaps that' s the style of my pity .
but pity won' t save her from the fire .
i remind all present that , they' re bound by their vow of obedience ... and on pain of excommunication ... to aim the lnquisitor in his struggle against heresy .
to sit with me on this tribunal ... and to share the burden ofthe verdict ...
i' d require the counsel ... oftwo fellowjudges .
my lord abbot ... and ...
brother william of baskerville .
salvatore ...
salvatore !
would you repeat your confession of last night ... that you and your accomplice , remigio de varagine ... were members ofthe heretical dolcinites ?
enough !
remigio de varagine , do you deny the confession ofyour accomplice ?
no .
i don' t deny it .
i' m proud of it !
for the twelve years i lived here ...
i stuffed my belly ... shagged my weak ... and squeezed the hungry peasants for dimes .
but now you' ve given me strength ... to remember what i once believed in with all my heart .
and for that i thank you .
to remember that you once looted and burnt the property ofthe church ?
yes !
to give it back to the people you stole it from !
and did you not kill many bishops and priests ?
yes !
i' d burn your people ... if i had the chance !
holly mary , mother of god , hear my humble prayer .
i know that my sin was very great ... but i beg you to not let her suffer for my wrongdoing .
blessed mother ... many years ago you granted a miracle by saving my master .
would you not do the same for this girl ? .
my master says that the simple folk always pay for all .
but , please , holly mother , do not let it be so .
guilty is that witch ... who' s seduced a monk ... and practiced his diabolical rituals in this holly place .
guilty is salvatore ... who' s confessed his heretical past ... and was caught in flagrant delito with a witch !
guilty is remigio de varagine ... who' s not regretted his former heresies and was caught ... trying to escape after murdering the herbalist severinus .
that' s a lie !
i never killed the herbalist ... or anyone else in this abbey !
i therefore , request you ... to confirm my sentence , my lord abbot .
my heart is full of sorrow ... but i can' t find no reason to contest ... the just sentence of the holly lnquisition .
and you , william of baskerville ?
yes , he is guilty .
guilty of having , in his youth ... misinterpreted the message ofthe gospels ... and he' s guilty of having confused ... the love of poverty with the blind destruction ... ofwealthy and property .
but , my lord abbot ... he' s innocent ofthe crimes that' ve bathed your abbey in blood .
for brother remigio cannot read greek ... and this entire mystery hinges on ... the theft and possession of a book written in greek ... and hidden in some secret part ofthe library .
as the verdict ofthe lnquisition was disputed by william ... we must extract the prisoner' s confession .
take him to the forge and show him the instruments .
i' il confess anything you want , but don' t torture me .
i can' t go through a night like salvatore !
very well .
why did you kill them ?
why ?
i don' t know why .
because you were inspired by the devil ?
yes ... that' s it .
i was inspired by the devil .
i' m inspired by the devil !
adralmech , lucifer , i call for you ...
lords of hell .
the shepherd has done his duty ... and the infected sheep must now be consigned to the purifying flames !
you may burn brother remigio ... but you won' t put a stop for the crimes being committed in this abbey !
other monks will meet death here ... and they' il also have black fingers and black tongues !
your eminence , i beg you ... we , franciscans , are disappointed with brother william .
once more we' ve seen that your theories protect heretics ... and lead to murder .
the debate' s concluded .
brother william has relaxed ... into the errors ofwhich he was formerly perjured .
having sought yet again to shield a heretic ... from just punishment by the lnquisition ...
he' il come with me to avignon for confirmation ... of my sentence by pope john .
i' m right .
ifonlyl could find the book andprove that gui was wrong !
but the antichrist was victorious once more ... and nothing seemed to be able to hinderhim .
come on .
when the pyres are light tonight ...
iet the flames purify ... each of us in his own heart .
let' s return to what was , and ever should be ... the office ofthis abbey : the preservation of knowledge .
preservation , i said .
not search for ... because there' s no progress in the history of knowledge ... merely a continuous and sublime recapitulation .
let' s now pray oh mighty ... that the blood eyed antichrist ... has been removed from our sacred precincts ... and our monastery has returned to peace .
the fifth trumpet had the power of a thousand scorpions ...
he told me .
who told you ?
his tongue' s black and his finger' s black ... as brother william foretold !
it' s brother malachia , father .
malachia ?
yes , father .
dear god !
not malachia !
will it never end ?
william of baskerville was right .
he said ...
yes !
he knew !
just as i' d have known , if i' d been the murderer !
find william of baskerville !
we can' t open the mirror !
perhaps pressing the 1a and the 7a letters ofthe word " four " .
but " four " only has 4 letters .
in latin , " quatuor " .
remember the inscription ofthe mirror ?
we had to press above the idol .
not " idolum " as in latin , but " eidolon " as in greek .
meaning " image : or " reflection " .
our own reflection !
this way , master !
no , this way , adso .
here ...
q and r.
pray god we' re not mistaken .
come .
good evening , venerable jorge .
i' ve been expecting you these several days past , william .
you must' ve flown to this chamber to reach it ahead of us .
you' ve discovered many things ... since your arrival at this abbey ... but the shortcut through the labyrinth isn' t among them .
so now , what' s it that you want ?
i want to see the book in greek you said was never written .
a book entirely devoted to comedy , which you hate ... as much as you hate laughter .
i want to see what' s probably the only the surviving copy ... ofthe 2nd book ofthe poetics ofaristotle .
william , what a magnificent librarian you' d have been !
here' s your well done reward .
read it .
leaf its secrets .
you' ve won .
it' s close now .
we' il now discuss how comedy stimulates the liking ridicule ... " " by using vulgar persons ... " " and taking pleasure from their defects .
carry on , william .
read it !
master , we must hurry .
if the light is too deem for you , give it to the boy ...
i' m sure he can read it .
i don' t want my pupil to turn your poisoned pages ... not without the protection of a glove , such as i' m wearing .
the door !
quick , before it closes !
venerable brother , there are many books that speak of comedy .
why does this one fill you with such fear ?
because it' s by aristotle .
this way .
do you , salvatore , renounce the devil and embrace jesus christ ... as your lord and savior ?
do you , remigio de veragine , renounce the devil ...
and embrace jesus ...
what for ?
it' s better die fast than to spend ... the rest of life in prison .
the devil i renounce is you , bernardo gui .
do you renounce the devil and embrace jesus as your savior ?
but what' s so alarming about laughter ?
laughter kills fear ... and without fear there can' t be faith .
and without fear to the devil ... there' s no more need to god .
but you won' t eliminate laughter by eliminating that book .
no , to be sure .
laughter will remain the common man' s recreation ... but what' il happen if , because of this book ...
iearned men work to pronounce permissible ... to laugh of everything ?
can we laugh at god ?
the world would be back to chaos .
therefore , i seal that which is not to be said ... in the tomb i become .
he' s there , behind the arch !
save me !
look !
courage , brother !
remember dolcino !
go out !
i insist !
go out !
i insist ! .
god , save him .
stay back .
burn the witch !
do you dare to raise your hands to the church ?
you won' t leave !
it' s all your wrong doing !
my master found out the murderer !
help me !
master ...
i never regretted my decision ... for i learned from my master what' s wise ... and good and true .
when at last we parted , he presented me with his glasses .
i was too young , he said ... but one day they' d serve me well .
in fact , i' m wearing them now while i write these lines .
he embraced me like a father ... and sent me on my way .
i never saw him again , and knew nothing of what have become of him ... but i always prayed that god received his soul ... and forgave his little vanities to which was driven ... by his intellectual pride .
and yet , now that i' m an old , old man ...
i must confess that all the faces that appeared to me out ofthe past ... the one lsee most clearly is that ofthe girl ... whom i never ceased to dream ... these many long years .
she was the only earthly love in my life ... yet i never knew not ever learned ... her name .
keep the name first of the rose , without which we won' t exist .
