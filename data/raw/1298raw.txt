so where are you ?
you' re in some motel room .
youjust wake up and you' re in ... .. in a motel room .
there' s the key .
it feels like maybe it' s the first time you' ve been here but ... .. perhaps you' ve been there for a week , ... .. three months , it' s ...
it' s kind of hard to say , i ...
i don' t know .
it' sjust an anonymous room .
this guy .
he' s here already .
lenny !
it' s leonard .
like i told you before .
did you ?
i must have forgot .
i guess i' ve already told you about my condition .
oh , well , only every time i see you .
my car .
this is your car .
oh , you' re in a playful mood .
it' s not good to make fun of a handicap .
just trying to have a little fun .
roll up your window .
hm ?
it' s broken .
i can get that fixed for you .
so , where to , sherlock ?
i got a lead on a place .
what the hell you wanna go there for ?
you know it ?
yeah , it' s just this fucked up building .
why do you wanna go there ?
don' t remember .
looks like somebody' s home .
ah , that thing' s been here for years .
what are you talking about ?
these tracks are only a few days old .
tracks ?
what are you , pocahontas ?
come on .
let' s take a look inside .
teddy .
don' t believe his lies .
he is the one .
kill him .
i' ve finally found him .
how long have i been looking ?
find anything ?
didn' t think so .
let' s go , huh ?
oh , fuck this .
you' re gonna pay for what you did .
beg forgiveness and then you pay .
you don' t have a clue , you freak !
beg my wife' s forgiveness before i blow your brains out .
leonard , you don' t know what' s going on .
you don' t even know my name .
teddy .
cos you read it off a fucking picture .
you don' t know who you are .
i' m leonard shelby from san francisco .
that' s who you were .
that' s not ... .. what you' ve become .
shut your mouth .
you want to know , lenny ?
come on .
come on , let' s go down to the basement .
let' s go down , you and me together .
then you' il know who you really are .
no !
it' sjust an anonymous room .
there' s nothing in the drawers .
but you look anyway .
nothing except the gideon bible , ... .. which i , of course , read religiously .
hm .
you know who you are and you know kind of all about yourself .
butjust for day to day stuff , notes are really useful .
sammy jankis had the same problem but he really had no system .
he wrote himself a ridiculous amount of notes but he' d get them all mixed up .
you really do need a system if ... .. ifyou' re gonna make it work .
hi .
hi .
i' m mr shelby from 304 .
what can i do for you , leonard ?
um ...
burt .
burt .
i' m not sure , i think i may have asked you to hold my calls .
you don' t know ?
i' m not too good on the phone .
you said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them .
yeah , yeah .
you don' t remember saying that .
i have this condition .
a condition ?
it' s my memory .
amnesia ?
no , no , it' s different from that .
i have no short term memory .
i know all about myself , i just ...
since my injury i can' t make new memories .
everything fades .
lf we talk for too long i' il forget how we started ... .. and next time i see you i won' t remember this conversation .
i don' t even know if i' ve met you before .
so if i seem a little strange or rude , or something , uh ...
i' ve told you this before , haven' t l ?
i don' t mean to mess with you but it' s so weird .
you don' t remember me at all ?
no .
we' ve talked a bunch of times .
i' m sure we have .
what' s the last thing you remember ?
my wife .
what' s it like ?
it' s like waking .
it' s like you just woke up .
that must suck .
it' s all backwards .
like , maybe you got an idea about what you want to do next ... .. but you don' t remember what you just did .
i mean , i' m exactly the opposite ...
how long have i been staying here ?
couple of days .
and you' re holding my calls ?
like you said .
ok , but this guy' s an exception .
you know this guy ?
yeah , it' s your friend , right ?
what makes you think that ?
i saw you together , that' s all .
he' s not my friend .
ok .
lf he calls or shows up here , give me a call in my room , ok ?
what , his name' s teddy ?
teddy , yeah .
all right .
look , i hope my condition' s not gonna be a problem for you .
not as long as you remember to pay the bill .
yeah .
ok .
forty .
this guy .
he' s here already .
lenny !
you really need a system ifyou' re gonna make it work .
you kinda learn to trust your handwriting .
it becomes an important part ofyour life .
you write yourself notes .
where you put them is really important .
you need ajacket that' s got , like , six pockets , ... .. particular pockets for particular things .
youjust kinda learn to know where things go and how the system works .
you have to be wary of other people writing stuff foryou ... .. that is not going to make sense or is gonna lead you astray .
i don' t know what makes people take advantage ... .. of somebody with this condition .
lfyou have a piece of information which ... is ... .. vital , writing on your body instead of on a piece ofpaper can be the answer .
it' s a permanent way of keeping a note .
who is this ?
remember sammy jankis .
sir , you left these at your table .
thanks .
ah , lincoln street ?
just go straight out on sixth street , ...
.. go east through town ...
i' m gonna write this down .
oh , it' s easy .
go straight out ...
trust me , i need to write this down .
the discount lnn .
discount lnn .
natalie .
my car .
teddy .
john edward gammell .
this guy told me his name was teddy .
don' t believe his lies .
yeah ?
mr gammell ?
lenny , is that you ?
john gammell ?
lenny , it' s teddy .
stay there .
i' il be right over .
ok .
i' il be waiting .
white male .
first name , john .
last name g for gammell .
drugs .
license plate .
sg1 3 ... .. 7lu .
it' s him .
i' ve found you , you fuck .
you said we talked before .
i don' t remember that .
yeah , but it' s not amnesia .
i remember up until my injury , i just can' t make new memories .
so i can' t remember talking to you .
what did we talk about ?
oh , sammy jankis .
i guess i tell people about sammy to help them understand .
sammy' s story helps me understand my own situation .
sammy wrote himself endless amounts of notes .
but he got mixed up .
i have a more graceful solution to the memory problem .
i' m disciplined and organised .
i use habit and routine to make my life possible .
sammy had no drive , ... .. no reason to make it work .
me ?
yeah , ... .. l got a reason .
today , 1pm , meet natalie for info .
she has also lost someone .
she will help you out ofpity .
natalie .
you don' t remember me .
i should' ve explained .
i have this cond ...
you did explain , lenny .
please call me leonard .
my wife called me lenny .
i know , you told me .
then i probably told you i hated it .
yeah .
do you mind taking your glasses off ?
it' s hard for me to ...
thanks .
so , you have information for me ?
ls that what your little note says ?
yeah .
must be tough living your life according to a couple of scraps of paper .
mix your laundry list with your grocery list and you' il end up eating your underwear .
i guess that' s why you have those freaky tattoos .
yeah , it' s tough .
it' s almost impossible .
look , i' m sorry i don' t remember you .
it' s nothing personal .
i do have information for you .
you gave me a license plate number .
had my friend at dmv trace it .
guess what name came up ?
john edward gammell .
john g.
do you know him ?
no .
but his face on his driver' s licence looked really familiar .
i think he' s been in the bar , maybe .
here' s a copy of his licence , his registration , photo and all .
are you sure you want this ?
have i told you what this man did ?
yeah .
well , then you shouldn' t have to ask .
even if you get revenge , you' re not gonna remember it .
you' re not even gonna know it happened .
my wife deserves vengeance .
it doesn' t make any difference if i know about it .
just because there are things i don' t remember ... .. doesn' t make my actions meaningless .
the world doesn' t just disappear when you close your eyes .
anyway , maybe i' il take a photograph to remind myself .
get another freaky tattoo .
tell me about her again .
why ?
because you like to remember her .
she was beautiful .
to me she was perfect .
no .
don' t just recite the words .
close your eyes and remember her .
you can just feel the details .
the bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words .
and you can feel these extreme moments .
even ifyou don' t want to .
you put these together and you get the feel of a person .
enough to know how much you miss them .
and how much you hate the person who took them away .
i , um , i added an address in here .
it might be useful .
it' s an abandoned place outside of town .
um , i guy i knew used to do bigger deals there .
it' s isolated .
sounds perfect .
do i owe you any ...
i wasn' t helping you for money .
i' m sorry .
it' s ok .
see , you have this condition .
you still staying at the discount lnn ?
room 304 ?
left it at my place .
yeah .
they treating you ok ?
i don' t remember .
you know what we have in common ?
we are both survivors .
you take care , leonard .
remember sammy jankis .
i met sammy through work . lnsurance .
i was an investigator .
i' d investigate the claims to see which ones were phoney .
i had to see through people' s bullshit .
it was useful experience cos now it' s my life .
when i meet someone , i don' t know if i' ve met them before .
i have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out .
myjob taught me the best way to find out what someone knew was let them talk .
watch the eyes and the body language .
lf someone scratches their nose , experts tell you it means they' re lying .
it really means they' re nervous .
people get nervous for all sorts of reasons .
it' s all about context .
yeah , i was good .
sammy was my first real challenge .
yo , lenny !
i thought you' d split for good .
well , things change .
so i see .
my name' s teddy .
i guess i' ve told you about my condition .
only every time i see ya .
come on , i' il buy you lunch .
have i told you about sammy jankis ?
mmm .
yeah .
i' m sick of hearing about the guy .
what about john g ?
you think he' s still here ?
who ?
johnny g , the guy you' re looking for .
that' s why you haven' t left town , right ?
maybe .
leonard , you have to be very careful .
why ?
you mentioned that maybe somebody was trying to set you up .
get you to kill the wrong guy .
i go on facts , not recommendations , but thank you .
lenny , you can' t trust a man' s life to your little notes and pictures .
why not ?
because your notes could be unreliable .
memory' s unreliable .
oh , please .
no , really .
memory' s not perfect , it' s not even that good .
ask the police .
eyewitness testimony is unreliable .
the cops don' t catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff .
they collect facts and draw conclusions .
that' s not what i' m saying .
facts , not memories .
that' s how you investigate .
i know , it' s what i used to do .
memory can change the shape of a room , it can change the colour of a car .
and memories can be distorted .
they' re an interpretation , not a record .
they' re irrelevant if you have the facts .
you really want to get this guy , don' t you ?
he killed my wife .
he took away my fucking memory .
he destroyed my ability to live .
you' re living .
only for revenge .
well , then we' il get the bastard .
where are you staying ?
the discount lnn .
i don' t know what room .
i haven' t got my key .
probably left it in your room .
hi .
i' m checked in here but i think i' ve misplaced my key .
how you doing , leonard ?
probably in the room , right ?
i don' t see my key anywhere .
oh , shit .
this is the wrong room .
you' re in 304 .
i' m sorry .
i fucked up .
this is not my room ?
no .
come on , let' s go .
then why is this my handwriting ?
well , ... this was your room but now you' re in 304 .
when was i in here ?
last week .
then i rented you another room on top .
why ?
business is slow , i mean , i told my boss about your condition and stuff , ... .. he said rent him another room .
so how many rooms am i checked into in this shit hole ?
just two .
so far .
well , ... .. at least you' re being honest about ripping me off .
you' re not going to remember anyway .
you don' t have to be that honest , burt .
leonard .
always get a receipt .
oh , yeah .
i' il write that down .
hey , what time is it ?
quarter to one .
excuse me .
your room' s ...
natalie .
you don' t remember me .
i' d just become an investigator when i came across sammy .
mr samuel r jankis , strangest case ever .
the guy' s a 58 year old , semiretired accountant .
he and his wife were in this car accident , nothing serious .
but he' s acting funny , he can' t get a handle on what' s going on .
the doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus , nothing conclusive .
sammy can' t remember anything for more than a couple of minutes .
can' t work , can' t do shit .
the medical bills pile up , his wife calls the insurance company and i get sent in .
this is my first big claims investigation so i really check into it .
sammy can thinkjust fine but he can' t make new memories .
he can only remember things for a couple of minutes .
he' d watch tv but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing , ... .. he couldn' t remember how it began .
he liked commercials .
they were short .
sammy .
it' s time for my shot .
the crazy part was that this guy , ... .. who couldn' t follow the plot of green acres any more , ... .. could do the most complicated things , ... .. as long as he learned them before the accident ... .. and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing .
the doctors assure me ... .. there' s a real condition , anterial grade memory loss , or short term memory loss .
it' s rare but legit .
but every time i see him , ... .. l catch this look , ... .. this ... slight look of recognition .
but he says he can' t remember me at all .
sammy , it' s ok .
i got it .
hi , mr shelby .
hi , mrs jankis .
now , i can read people and i' m thinking " bad actor " .
so now i' m suspicious and i order more tests .
awake .
oh , where am l ?
somebody' s bedroom .
oh , it must be her room .
but who is she ?
it' s only me .
did you sleep ok ?
yeah .
you ?
oh , shit .
shit .
i gotta be someplace .
it' s pretty weird .
it' s useful .
you never write a phone number on your hand ?
i , um , i should be able to talk to my friend today ...
.. about the license plate .
yeah , the license plate .
john g' s license plate .
you have it tattooed on your thigh .
natalie .
she has also lost someone .
she will help you out ofpity .
lf it' s registered in this state , ... .. it should only take a couple seconds to pull up his licence and registration .
i' il call you as soon as i talk to him .
could we arrange a meeting now ?
i' m not too good on the phone .
you know , it' s great that you ...
well , that you' re ... .. helping me ... .. like this .
i' m helping you because you helped me .
so next time you see me , ... .. will you remember me ?
i think you will .
i' m sorry .
lenny , before you go , could i have my shirt back , please ?
yo , lenny !
i thought you' d split for good .
sammy couldn' t pick up any new skills at all .
but i find something in my research .
conditioning .
sammy should still be able to learn through repetition .
it' s how you learn stuff like riding a bike .
you get better through practice .
it' s a different part of the brain from the short term memory .
so i had the doctors test sammy' s response to conditioning .
pick up any three objects .
that' s a test ?
where were you guys when i did my cpa ?
sorry .
ta da !
ow !
what the fuck ?
it' s a test , sammy .
test this , you fucking quack .
some of the objects were electrified .
they' d give him a shock .
they kept repeating the test , always with the same objects electrified .
the point was to see if sammy could learn to avoid the electrified objects , ... .. not by memory , but by instinct .
natalie , right ?
who the fuck is dodd ?
guess i don' t have to worry about him any more .
what the fuck have you got me into ?
shh .
come inside .
who is he ?
calm down .
ok ?
this is my problem .
you offered to help .
it' s nothing to do with your investigation .
how did you get me into this ?
you offered to help me when you saw what he did to my face .
how do i know he did that to your face ?
i came straight to you after he did it .
i showed you what he did and i asked you to help me .
oh , and i just take your word ?
yeah .
something doesn' t feel right .
i think someone' s fucking with me , trying to get me to kill the wrong guy .
did you ?
what ?
kill him ?
course not !
hey .
sit down , ok ?
sit .
this has nothing to do with you .
you helped me out and i' m grateful .
you have to burn them .
leonard , you decided to help me .
trust your own judgement .
you can question everything , you can never know anything for sure .
there are things you know for sure .
such as ?
i know what that' s gonna sound like when i knock on it .
i know what that' s gonna feel like when i pick it up .
see ?
certainties .
it' s the kind of memory you take for granted .
you know , i can remember so much .
the feel of the world ...
and her .
she' s gone .
and the present is trivia which i scribble down as fucking notes .
hey , come on .
try and relax .
come on .
it' s not easy for me to relax .
shh .
shhh .
come on , take your jacket off .
here .
come on .
hey .
didn' t think you were the type .
it' s backwards .
come here .
come here .
what about here ?
maybe it' s ... for when i find him .
i' ve lost somebody too .
i' m sorry .
his name was jimmy .
what happened to him ?
he went to meet somebody .
he never came back .
who did he go to meet ?
a guy called teddy .
what do the police think ?
they don' t look too hard for guys like jimmy .
when you find this guy , this ... .. john g , what are you gonna do ?
i' m gonna kill him .
maybe i can help you find him .
i don' t even know how long she' s been gone .
it' s like i' ve woken up in bed and she' s not here ... .. because she' s gone to the bathroom or something .
but somehow i just ...
i just know she' s never gonna come back to bed .
lf i could just ... .. reach over and touch her side of the bed , ... .. l would know that it was cold .
but i can' t .
i know i can' t have her back .
but i don' t want to wake up in the morning thinking she' s still here .
i lie here not knowing how long i' ve been alone .
so how ...
how can i heal ?
how am i supposed to heal if i can' t ... .. feel time ?
she has also lost someone .
she will help you out ofpity .
they kept testing sammy for months .
always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge .
ow !
what the fuck ?
it' s a test , sammy .
test this , you fucking quack !
even with total short term memory loss , ... .. sammy should have learned instinctively to stop picking up the wrong objects .
other cases responded to conditioning , sammy didn' t respond at all .
it suggested that his condition was psychological not physical .
we turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn' t covered for mental illness .
his wife got stuck with the bills and i got a big promotion .
conditioning didn' t work for sammy , so he became helpless .
but it works for me .
i live the way sammy couldn' t .
habit and routine make my life possible .
conditioning .
acting on instinct .
awake .
where am l ?
motel room .
oh .
some anonymous motel room .
nothing in the drawers .
but i' il take a look anyway .
nothing except the gideon bi ...
bible .
hey !
open up !
just a minute !
open the door !
lenny ?
open the door !
come on !
hi , teddy .
finished playing with yourself , lenny ?
oh !
oh , i get it .
amorous neighbours .
what are you doing here ?
you called me .
you said you needed my help .
you know , i' ve had more rewarding friendships than this one .
although i do get to keep telling the same jokes .
what the fuck is that ?
who the fuck is that ?
you don' t know him ?
no !
should l ?
wait a minute . ls that john g ?
i don' t think so .
you don' t think so ?
you didn' t write it down ?
i might have fallen asleep before i did .
for christ sakes !
ask him .
what' s your name ?
your name ?
dodd .
and who did this to you ?
what ?
who did this to you ?
you did .
i' m not going to help you kill that guy .
no , no .
just let me think for a minute .
ok , natalie .
who' s natalie ?
natalie who ?
why ?
maybe i know her .
look , we gotta get him out of here .
all right , all right , all right .
he' s got to have a car , right ?
we take him to his car , tell him to get the fuck out of town or we' re gonna kill him .
we can' t walk him out of here tied up and bleeding .
how the fuck did you get him up here ?
i don' t know !
you don' t know .
yes , i do .
this is not my room .
it must be his room .
great .
let' s go .
no , no , no .
we can' t just leave him here .
why not ?
because the maid' s gonna walk in .
she' il see him , call the cops .
he can ld us .
ok .
we untie him , we clean him up ... .. and we march him out of here with a gun in his back .
a gun .
why would i have a gun ?
it must be his .
i don' t think they' d let someone like me carry a gun .
fucking hope not .
which one ?
we should probably steal his car .
you know , teach him a lesson .
shut up .
it' s all right for you , you' ve got the jag .
all right , get in .
i' m gonna ride with him , you follow us .
give me your keys .
take your own car .
so was he scared ?
i think it was your sinister moustache .
fuck you .
should have stolen his car .
why ?
what' s wrong with this one ?
nothing .
you want to trade ?
so what do you do now ?
i' m gonna find out what the fuck that was all about .
natalie , right ?
who the fuck is dodd ?
sammy' s wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him .
and fighting the company' s decision .
but it wasn' t the money that got to her .
i never said that sammy was faking .
sammy , i have an idea .
just that his problem was mental , not physical .
you' re gonna have a pen in your pocket .
she couldn' t understand .
i did something wrong ?
you did something wrong !
we' re gonna deal with it .
we' re gonna try a little harder .
she looks into his eyes and sees the same person ... .. and if it' s not a physical problem , he should snap out of it .
ellen called !
ellen called .
ellen called .
ellen ...
ellen can' t come today !
ellen can' t come !
i' m so sorry !
i' m sorry !
i' m trying !
i' m sorry !
so , leonard shelby from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt .
just like he gave it to the doctors .
but i never said that he was faking .
i never said that .
hm .
i don' t feel drunk .
hello ?
housekeeping .
oh , shit !
not right now !
oh , i' m sorry .
dodd .
put him onto teddy orjust get rid of him for natalie .
dodd .
get rid of him .
ask natalie .
teddy , teddy .
yeah , leave your number , you know what to do .
yeah .
this is a message for teddy .
i' m at the mount crest lnn on fifth street , room six .
i need you to come over as soon as you get this .
it' s important .
oh , this is leonard .
thanks .
bye .
phew !
fuck !
mrs jankis didn' t understand that you can' t bully someone into remembering .
the more pressure you' re under , the harder it gets .
ah .
well , then , call me back ?
ok .
so what am i doing ?
oh , i' m chasing this guy .
no .
he' s chasing me .
ah !
fuck !
dodd , white guy , mount crest lnn on fifth street .
i' il get thejump on you , you fucker .
oh , fuck !
sorry .
i need a weapon .
this' il do .
hm .
i don' t feel drunk .
do i know this guy ?
he seems to know me .
what the fuck ?
i like your car .
thank you .
where' d you get it ?
are you interested in buying one ?
what , i haven' t made a strong enough impression on you ?
i wouldn' t be too hard on yourself .
ok .
so what am i doing ?
who is this ?
ouch !
cut it out .
how can you read that again ?
it' s good .
you' ve read it , like , a thousand times .
i enjoy it .
i thought the pleasure of a book was in wanting to know what happens next .
don' t be a prick .
i' m not reading it to annoy you .
i enjoy it .
just let me read .
please ?
probably tried this before .
probably burned truckloads ofyour stuff .
can' t remember to forget you .
yeah .
uh huh .
well , sir , that' d certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries .
i was hoping for more on the drugs angle .
will you hang on a sec ?
the police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house .
the car was stolen .
his prints were all over it .
i got friends in the department .
they gave me a copy .
i dealt with the police a lot in my insurance job .
with my condition it' s really tough .
i can' t keep it all in mind at once .
i have to summarise the sections .
there are pages missing .
i guess i' ve been trying to log them all .
i don' t know why these are crossed out .
they weren' t even looking for john g.
the stuff they found in the car fit in with what they believed had happened , ... .. so they didn' t chase it up .
honey ?
honey , it' s late .
everything ok ?
you ok in there ?
was it good for you ?
what ?
was i supposed to lock the door ?
no .
i' d like you to leave now .
there' s something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn' t ring true .
the police claim the guy was an addict needing money to score .
it' s bullshit .
he' s not gonna go breaking into places while he' s still got a stash that big .
well , i think john g left it there .
or planted it there .
how do you know that ?
oh , shit , that' s true .
it fits .
so he' s a dealer .
hang on a sec .
now we' re getting somewhere .
discount lnn .
yeah , ok .
blonde' s fine .
well , that' s what they say .
the discount lnn .
304 .
leonard .
well , what then ?
we just go to bed .
you wait for me to fall asleep .
you go into the bathroom and slam the door .
slam it ?
yeah .
loud enough to wake me up .
and that' s it ?
that' s it .
ah ...
yeah , first i just need you to put these things around the room .
pretend they' re your things and this is your bedroom .
should i wear it ?
no , no , no .
uh , just like you took it off .
i don' t want you to use it .
i' m sorry .
i just mean put them around the room , as if they were your ... your things .
whatever gets you off .
i can' t blame the cops for not taking me seriously .
this is a difficult condition to understand .
look at sammy jankis .
his own wife couldn' t deal with it .
i told you how she tried to get him to snap out of it .
she came to see me at the office .
i found out all kinds of shit .
she told me about life with sammy .
how she treated him .
thank you for seeing me .
she' d get sammy to hide food around the house , ... .. then she' d stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember .
i' ve taken him to a parking lot and , uh ...
she wasn' t a cruel person .
shejust wanted her old sammy back .
you know all about sammy and you' ve decided he' s faking .
the company' s position isn' t that sammy' s faking anything , ... .. just that his condition can' t be shown to be ...
i just want to know your honest opinion about sammy .
we shouldn' t be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal .
i' m not appealing the decision .
then why are you here ?
try to understand , when i look at sammy , i don' t see some ... vegetable .
i see my same old sammy .
what do you think that' s like for me , ... .. to suspect that he might be imagining this whole problem ?
that if i just could say the right thing , ... .. he' d snap out of it and go back to being normal .
lf i ...
lf i knew that my old sammy were truly gone , ... .. then i could say goodbye and start loving this new sammy .
as long as i have doubt i can' t say goodbye and move on .
what do you want from me ?
i want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds ... .. and tell me if you really believe that sammy' s faking his condition .
i need to know ... .. what you honestly believe .
i believe that sammy should be physically capable of making new memories .
thank you .
i thought i' d helped her .
i thought she just needed an answer .
i didn' t think it was important what it was .
just that she had one to believe .
a car this nice you should lock .
who the fuck are you ?
teddy , your buddy .
prove it !
remember sammy ?
you told me about sammy !
jeez !
what the fuck are you doing in my car ?
what , your sense of humour went with the memory ?
do you know why you' re here ?
unfinished business .
lenny , ... .. let me inform you , your business here is very much finished .
you' re still here because of natalie .
who' s natalie ?
schmuck !
whose house do you think you just walked out of ?
that' s right , take a look at your pictures .
i bet you got one of her .
oh , nice shot , leibovitz
you' il want to make a note .
you can' t trust her .
why' s that ?
because by now she' s taken a look at the suit and the car ... .. and she' s figuring out ways of turning the situation to her advantage .
she' s already got you staying with her , for christ sakes .
you can' t go back there .
let me give you the name of a motel .
you' re lucky i ran into you .
that broad' s bad news .
what do you mean , " bad news " ?
she' s involved with drugs .
look .
see these ?
this is the bar where she works .
her boyfriend' s a drug dealer .
she takes orders for him , arranges meets .
he writes messages on the back of these , ... .. then she slips him the answers when she serves him his drinks .
why should i care ?
because when she gets jammed up , ... .. she' s gonna use you to protect herself .
from who ?
guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend .
guys are gonna come after her .
somebody' s got to pay , lenny .
somebody always pays .
maybe she' il make it you .
oh , yeah ?
well , maybe she' il make it you . ls that it ?
you worried that she' s gonna use me against you ?
no .
why not ?
because she doesn' t know who i am .
why are you following me ?
maybe i wanna help .
she doesn' t know anything about your investigation .
ok , einstein ?
so write this down .
when she offers to help , it' il be for her own reasons .
i' m not lying .
take my pen , write this down .
do not trust her .
there .
you happy now ?
i won' t be happy until you leave town .
why not ?
you ever wonder how long you can hang around here ...
.. before people start asking questions ?
what sort of questions ?
the same questions you should be asking yourself .
like what ?
like how did you get this suit , the car ?
i have money .
from what ?
my wife' s death .
i used to work in insurance .
we were well covered .
oh !
so in your grief you wandered into a jaguar dealership ?
you don' t have a clue , do you ?
you don' t even know who you are .
yes , i do .
i don' t have amnesia .
i remember everything right up until the incident .
i am leonard shelby , i am from san francisco ...
that' s who you were .
you do not know who you are .
what you' ve become since ... .. the incident .
you wander around playing detective .
you don' t even know how long ago it was .
let me put it this way .
were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance ?
i didn' t sell insurance , i investigated it .
right , right .
you' re an investigator .
maybe you should investigate yourself .
oh , thank you for the advice .
look , do me a favour , don' t go back in there .
will you take the motel out of town ?
it' s been fun , lenny .
do not trust her .
don' t believe his lies .
oh , fuck it .
i need my own place .
no .
she shouldn' t have given me that responsibility .
i' m a claims investigator , not a doctor .
yeah , yeah , i guess .
i' ve got all sorts of other considerations .
legal responsibility , large financ ...
who is this ?
write this down .
write down what happened .
write it down .

you' re ok .
i' il just get some ice for your face .

i did exactly what you told me to do .
i went to dodd ... .. and i told him that i didn' t have any of jimmy' s money , ... .. or the drugs .
and that this teddy must have taken everything .
and what did he say ?
he didn' t believe me .
he said if i don' t have the drugs by tomorrow , he' s gonna kill me .
and then he just ... he just started hitting me .
where is he ?
why ?
i' il go see him .
i' il give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called teddy .
oh , he' il kill you , lenny .
my wife used to call me lenny .
yeah ?
yeah , i hated it .
oh , this guy is so dangerous .

what does he want ?
wants to know what happened to jimmy and his money .

no .
what' s this all about ?
you don' t have a fucking clue , do you ?
you' re just blissfully ignorant , aren' t you ?
look , i have this condition .
i know all about your fucking condition !
i probably know more about it than you , you don' t have a clue about anything else .
what happened ?
jimmy went to meet a guy named teddy .
he took a lot of money with him and never came back .
jimmy' s partners think i set him up .
i don' t know if you know this teddy .
neither do l .
don' t protect him !
help me .
how ?
get rid of dodd for me .
what ?
kill him .
i' il pay you .
what do you think i am ?
i' m not gonna kill someone for money .

what would you kill for ?
you' d kill for your wife , wouldn' t you ?
that' s different .
not to me , i wasn' t married to her !
hey , don' t talk about my wife .

i can say whatever i want and you won' t remember !
i can call your wife a fucking whore and we can still be friends .

otherwise you could write yourself a note about how much natalie hates your guts ... .. and that i called your wife a whore !
don' t say another fucking word !
about your whore of a wife ?
i read about your condition , leonard .
you know one of the causes of short term memory loss ?
venereal disease .
maybe your cunt of a fucking wife ... .. sucked one too many diseased cocks and turned you into a retard !
you sad , sad freak .
i can say whatever the fuck i want and you won' t remember .
we' il still be best friends .
or maybe even lovers .

he beat the shit out of me .

who ?
fuck , leonard , dodd !
dodd beat the shit out of me .
hello ?
it' s burt , from the front desk .
yeah ?
i know you said you didn' t want any calls but this guy on the phone says he' s a cop .
a cop ?
yeah .
he says you' re really gonna wanna know what he has to say .
i' m not too good on the phone .
i need to look people in the eye .
well , what ...
you can , um , you can crash on the couch .
it' s comfortable .
just have a seat .
thanks .
so , how long do you think it' s gonna take you ?
hm ?
you told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife .
oh , it depends on if he' s here in town or if he' s moved on .
i have my file here .
can i ask you something ?
lf you have all that information , why haven' t the police found him for you ?
they' re not looking for him .
why not ?
they don' t think he exists .
you see , i told them what i remembered .
i was asleep .
something woke me up .
her side of the bed was cold .
she' d obviously been gone for a while .
there had to be a second man .
somebody hit me from behind .
i remember .
it' s the last thing i do remember .
look , the police didn' t believe me .
lf we check ...
how did they explain what you do remember ?
the gun and stuff ?
john g was clever .
he was clever .
he took the dead man' s gun and replaced it with the sap he hit me with .
he left my gun and the getaway car .
he gave the police a complete package .
they found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man' s hand .
and they only found my gun .
they didn' t need to look for anybody else .
i was the only guy who disagreed with the facts and i had brain damage .
the cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition .
leonard .
you can stay here for a couple of days if it will help you .
oh , thanks .
i have to go back to work , so , um , just make yourself at home .
you can watch tv or have some food .
whatever you want , ok ?
make yourself at home .
one thing .
something to remember you by .
my name is natalie .
natalie .
what' s wrong ?
somebody' s come already .
on the house .
thanks .
my , you really do have a problem .
just like that cop said .
hm ?
your condition .
well , nobody' s perfect .
what' s the last thing that you do remember ?
my wife .
that' s sweet .
dying .
i remember my wife dying .
let me , um , get you another one .
i think this one' s dusty .
why are you calling me ?
what do you want ?
i know you' re a cop .
what do you want ?
have i done something wrong ?
i don' t know , something bad , maybe .
look , why are you asking me ?
i can' t remember what i' ve done .
you wouldn' t believe me anyway .
because of my condition , you don' t believe someone with this condition .
nobody believed sammy !
i didn' t even fucking believe sammy !
ferdy' s bar .
come by after .
natalie .
a beer , please .
what do you want ?
a beer , please .
you can' t just waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer .
what , is there a dress code ?
why are you here ?
i' m meeting someone called natalie .
well , that' s me .
yeah , we met before , right ?
then why am i here ?
i don' t know , why don' t you tell me ?
i don' t remember .
i have no short term memory .
oh , you' re that memory guy .
how do you know about me ?
my boyfriend told me about you .
oh , yeah ?
who' s your boyfriend ?
jimmy grants .
do you know him ?
no .
he knows you .
he told me about you .
he said you were staying at the discount .
ln fact , a cop came by earlier and was looking for you .
said he was looking for a guy who can' t remember anything , ... .. wouldn' t know how he' d got here or what he' d done .
i get a lot of guys round here like that .
chronic alcoholism is one cause of short term memory loss .
are you teddy ?
no , my name' s leonard .
did teddy send you ?
i don' t know .
what' s happened to jimmy ?
i don' t know that , either .
sorry .
you don' t remember anything ?
you don' t remember where you' ve been or what you' ve just done ?
i can' t make new memories .
everything just fades .
then why did you come here ?
i found this in my pocket .
your pocket ?
bar bet .
care to contribute ?
no , thanks .
it' s for a lot of money .
come on .
proceeds are going to charity .
help me out .
thank you .
on the house .
thanks .
it' s completely fucked because nobody believes you .
it' s amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility .
i guess it' s poetic justice for not believing sammy .
you know the truth about my condition , officer ?
you don' t know anything .
you feel angry , you don' t know why .
you feel guilty , you have no idea why .
you could do anything and not have the faintest idea ten minutes later .
like sammy .
what if i' d done something like sammy ?
i didn' t tell you ?
what happened to sammy and his wife ?
she came to see me at my office .
i didn' t tell her what i really thought but i never said that he was faking .
just that his condition was mental , not physical .
i found out later that she went home and gave sammy his final exam .
sammy ?
it' s time for my shot .
she knew beyond a doubt that he loved her , so she found a way to test him .
sammy ?
it' s time for my shot .
hm .
she really thought she' d call his bluff .
there you go .
or shejust didn' t want to live with the things she' d put him through .
sammy ?
it' s time for my shot .
it won' t hurt .
she went into a coma and never recovered .
sammy couldn' t understand or explain what happened .
oh !
he' s been in a home ever since .
he doesn' t even know his wife is dead .
i was wrong about sammy and i was wrong about his wife .
she wasn' t interested in the money .
she needed to understand his problem .
his brain didn' t respond to conditioning but he wasn' t a con man .
and when she looked into his eyes , she thought he could be the same person .
when i looked into his eyes , i thought i saw recognition .
now i know you fake it .
lf you think you' re supposed to recognise somebody , you pretend to .
you bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors .
you bluff it to seem less of a freak .
what drug dealer ?
hey , lenny , how you doing ?
it' s private back here .
it' s ok , we know each other .
right , kid ?
how did you know i was in here ?
the jag' s out front .
what are you still doing here , lenny ?
there' s plenty of tattoo parlours up north .
i guess i wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind .
give me the keys , i' il move it .
it' il be all right .
wait out there .
oh , for christ ...
give me a minute , i' ve got to get something for you .
fact six .
car licence sg13 7lu .
look , wait a minute , will ya ?
we gotta get you out of here .
why ?
oh , man .
come on , leonard .
how many times i gotta tell you ?
it' s not safe for you to hang around .
why not ?
because that cop' s looking for you .
i gotta get you a new identity , ... .. some new clothes , a different car would do for now .
put these on .
whoa , whoa .
what cop ?
he' s a bad cop .
he' s the one that checked you into the discount lnn .
he' s been calling you for days , slipping envelopes under your door , shit like that .
how do you know this ?
he told me .
he' s been laughing at you .
you' re full of shit .
no , i' m not .
he knows you' re no good on the phone so he' s been calling you up .
sometimes you don' t answer the phone ... .. so he slips shit under your door to scare you into answering it , ... .. giving you a line of crap about john g being a local drug dealer .
jimmy grants .
who' s jimmy grants ?
leonard , jimmy' s the drug dealer .
the cop wants to know how his operation is run .
he' s got some score in mind .
somehow you' re involved .
how do you know him ?
i' m a snitch .
he' s a cop from out of town .
the local boys put us together .
lf he knew i was helping you , he' d fucking kill me .
so take these clothes , put them on and get the fuck out of here .
come on , leonard , just go .
you are full of shit .
come by after .
natalie .
ferdy' s bar .
hey , jimmy .
i' m sorry , i , uh , thought you were somebody else .
sorry .
that' s ok .
this jimmy grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works ?
but he' s not going to bring her along ?
he' il come by himself , right ?
i always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him .
no , officer .
i' m as ready as i' il ever be .
you' re in the lobby ?
what do you look like ?
i' il be right there .
lenny !
officer gammell ?
yeah .
come on .

sammy .
he said sammy .
how does he know about sammy ?
oh , fuck .

hey , mister !
i need help !
there' s a guy in here , he' s hurt bad .
we gotta get him to a doctor .
all right .
i don' t know what happened .
i' ve got this memory thing .
do i know you ?
no .
don' t worry , i' m a cop .
ls he still breathing ?
well , i don' t know .
maybe .
what the hell were you guys doing ?
i don' t remember , i have this condition .
i hope it' s not as serious as his cos this guy' s dead .
ow !
lenny !
that shit kills !
so you remember me now , huh ?
you are a fucking cop !
and i' m the guy that helped you find him .
get up !
get up !
lenny , you got the wrong idea !
who is that ?
he knew me .
of course he did , he raped your wife , he fucked up your brain .
bullshit !
he' s not the guy .
his name is james f grants .
john g. check your tattoos .
why did he bring two hundred grand ?
what ?
what was it for ?
amphetamines i told him i had .
ls this a drug deal ?
no .
yeah , that and your thing .
look , jimmy' s your guy .
i figured we' d make a few dollars on the side .
how did he know me ?
the discount lnn .
he dealt out of there .
the guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came round .
he called jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture .
you' re fucking using me .
no !
you get half .
he knew about sammy , why would i tell him about sammy ? !
you tell everybody about sammy !
everybody who' il listen !
remember sammy jankis ?
remember sammy jankis ?
great story .
gets better every time you tell it .
so you lie to yourself to be happy .
there' s nothing wrong with that .
we all do it .
who cares if there' s a few little details you' d rather not remember ?
what the fuck are you talking about ?
i don' t know .
your wife surviving the assault .
her not believing your condition .
the torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside .
the insulin .
that' s sammy , not me .
i told you about sammy .
yeah , right .
like you tell yourself over and over again .
condtitioning yourself to remember , learning through repetition .
sammy let his wife kill herself .
sammy ended up in an institution .
sammy was a con man .
a faker .
i never said that sammy was faking .
you exposed him for what he was .
a fraud .
i was wrong .
that' s the whole point .
see , sammy' s wife came to me ...
sammy didn' t have a wife .
it was your wife who had diabetes .
ouch !
my wife wasn' t diabetic .
you sure ?
ouch !
cut it out !
she wasn' t diabetic .
you think i don' t know my own wife ?
what the fuck is wrong with you ?
i guess i can only make you remember the things you want to be true .
like old jimmy down there .
he' s not the right guy .
he was to you .
come on , you got your revenge .
enjoy it while you still remember .
what difference does it make whether he was your guy or not ?
it makes all the difference .
why ?
you' re never gonna know .
yes , i will .
no , you won' t .
somehow i' il know .
you won' t remember !
when it' s done , i will know .
i thought so , too , i was sure of it , but you didn' t !
that' s right .
the real john g. i helped you find him over a year ago .
he' s already dead .
don' t lie to me any more .
look , lenny , ... .. l was the cop assigned to your wife' s case , i believed you .
i thought you deserved a chance for revenge .
i' m the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night .
the guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife .
we found him , you killed him .
but you didn' t remember .
so i helped you start looking again , looking for the guy you already killed .
oh , yeah ?
so who was he ?
just some guy .
does it matter who ?
no reason , lenny , no conspiracy , just bad fucking luck .
couple of junkies too strung out to realise your wife didn' t live alone .
but when you killed him i was so convinced that you' d remember .
but it didn' t stick .
like nothing ever sticks , like this won' t stick .
i took that picture .
just when you did it .
look how happy you are .
i wanted to see that face again .
oh , gee , thanks
fuck you .
i gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help .
you don' t want the truth .
you make up your own truth , like your police file .
it was complete when i gave it to you .
who took out the twelve pages ?
you , probably .
no , it wasn' t me , see , it was you .
why would i do that ?
to create a puzzle you could never solve .
do you know how many towns , ... .. how many john gs or james gs ?
i mean , shit , lenny , i' m a fucking john g.
your name' s teddy .
my mother calls me teddy .
my name' s john edward gammell .
cheer up .
there' s plenty of john gs for us to find .
all you do is moan !
i' m the one that has to live with what you' ve done .
i' m the one that put it all together .
you , you wander around , you' re playing detective .
you' re living a dream , kid .
a dead wife to pine for , a sense of purpose to your life , ... .. a romantic quest that you wouldn' t end even if i wasn' t in the picture .
i should kill you .
quit it !
lenny , come on .
you' re not a killer .
that' s why you' re so good at it .
come on , what are you doing ?
you know what time it is ?
it' s beer o' clock , i' m buying .
fuck !
i' m not a killer .
i' mjust someone who wanted to make things right .
can ljust let myself forget what you' ve told me ?
can ljust let myself forget what you made me do ?
you think ljust want another puzzle to solve ?
another john g to look for ?
you' re a john g.

# we lay in each other' s arms
# but the room isjust an empty space
# i guess we lived it out
# something in the air
# we smile too fast
# then can' t think of a thing to say
# lived with the best times
# left with the worst
# i' ve danced with you too long
# nothing left to save
# there' s something in the air
# something in my eye
# i' ve danced with you too long
# yeah
# something in the air
# something in my eye
# abracadoo
# i lose you
# we can' t avoid the clash
# the big mistake
# now we' re gonna pay and pay
# i guess you know i never wanted anyone more than you
# lived all our best times
# left with the worst
# i' ve danced with you too long
# say what you will
# but there' s something in the air
# something in my eye
# i' ve danced with you too long
# there' s something i have to say
# there' s something in the air
# i' ve danced with you too long #
