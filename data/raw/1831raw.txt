fish .
fish .
tropical fish , actually .
when i was a kid , i used to go to the library and pick out all the books ... ... with tropical fish , you know .
beautiful colors and shapes .
when i was eight years old , i realized someone had to take pictures of the fish .
and i wanted that to be me .
but i grew up and i realized that ... things don' t have to be extraordinary to be beautiful .
the ordinary could be just as beautiful .
like what ?
well ...
like you see the couple there ?
look at the way the girl is holding on to him so tight .
but he can still drink his coffee .
it looks like she feels safe wrapped around him .

one minute i' m looking at rings , and the next i' m here , doing this .
whoa .
whoa , looking at rings ?
i didn' t realize you were that serious .
apparently , i' m not .
see , that' s how the universe works .
the minute you make a decision you decide on anything along comes temptation .
what would you do ?
keep them both and hope they didn' t find out about each other is what i would do .
that' s perfect .
asshole .
i have to find out why she left .
she got scared .
everyone gets scared .
no , not lisa .
she wouldn' t have left without an explanation .
without some sort of letter or a call or something .
she' s not like that .
something must' ve happened , and whatever it was
screwed you up big time .
i know she loved me .

i figured maybe i' m missing something , so i come , i take a closer look .
but you know what ?
i' m still not buying it .
what the hell' s the matter with you today ?

you' re upset , you' re confused , it' s tearing you up inside !
we' ve gotta see the love , but we' ve also gotta see the agony .
