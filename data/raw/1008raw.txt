it' s painful to discuss .
i hit puberty in the first grade , and there' s only so many times ... a seven year old can be called " fire hose " before he cracks .
that' s really too bad because my family provides ... a $50, 000 cash scholarship ... to minority students , and i thought ...
$50, 000 ?
yeah . $50, 000 ?
yup , that' s it .
look at that .
