i remember the first war .
the way the sky burned .
the faces of angels destroyed .
i saw a third of heaven' s iegion banished ... and the creation of heil .
i stood with my brothers and watched lucifer fail .
but now my brothers are not brothers .
and we have come here , where we are mortal , to steai a dark soui not yet lucifer' s ... to serve our cause .
i have always obeyed .
but i never thought the war ... would happen again .
come to our help , lord , holy father , almighty and eternai god .
you are the source of every honor and dignity , of aii progress and stability .
you watch over the growing family of man by your gift of wisdom ... and your pattern of order .
when you had appointed high priests to rule your people ,
you chose other men next to them in rank and dignity ... to be with them and to help them in their task .
and so there grew up the ranks of priests ... and the offices of levites established by sacred rites .
in the desert you extended the spirit of moses to 70 wise men ... who helped him to rule the great company of his people .
he shared among the sons of aaron the fuilness of their father' s power , to provide worthy priests in sufficient number ... for the increasing rites of sacrifice and worship .
with the same ioving care you gave companions to your son' s apostles ... to help in teaching the faith , they preached the gospei to the whole world .
let joseph , who is to be ordained priest , come forward .
lord , i am not worthy to receive you , but say the word and i shaii be healed .
almighty father , grant to this servant of yours the dignity of the priesthood .
renew within him the spirit of holiness ... as a coworker with the order of bishops .
we ask this through our lord jesus christ .
one god , forever and ever .
amen .
let thomas , who is to be ordained priest , come forward .
some people iose their faith because heaven shows them too iittle .
but how many people iose their faith because heaven shows them too much ?
years iater , of aii the gospels i iearned in seminary school , a verse from st. paui stays with me .
even now in heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons .
hey , you' re not supposed to be up here .
sorry .
don' t fuckin ' move .
you don' t need a gun , thomas .
who are you ?
everything used to be much simpler , didn' t it ?
get down , slow .
everyone thinks they know what heaven is iike .
turn around .
turn around !
heaven isn' t heaven anymore .
now , take it easy .
thomas thomas !
calm down .
take it easy .
wiii you iisten ?
i was in the church that day .
i know what you saw .
i know why you ieft your faith on that floor .
what do you want ?
you have no idea what this is iike for me .
a thesis on angels in religious scripture " ... by thomas dagget .
do you stiii believe ... any of it ?
you' re asking me as a cop ?
as a priest .
but i' m not a priest .
st. christopher .
go your way in safety .
do you believe ... that you' re part of god' s plan ,
thomas ?
that' s a complicated question .
no , it isn' t .
you found it , haven' t you ?
you can' t keep it from us , simon !
aii right .
why don' t you caii it in ?
weil , iook at this .
tommy dagget actuaily iit by the iight of morning .
what am i doin ' here , burrows ?
i work nights .
it' s not even my division .
weil , we' ii get to that .
our friend here did a half gainer from the fourth floor .
jumper ?
not unless he decided not to bother opening the window first .
81 , clear .
unit 14 , clear .
was he fucked up or what ?
weil , he wasn' t exactly in condition to walk a chalk iine when we got here .
you' re welcome to smeii his breath , if you iike .
he is missing one or two things , though .
what' s that ?
his eyes .
maybe they' re stuck in the radiator griil .
who' s the room registered under ?
john smith .
anything interesting inside ?
weil , there are what an experienced detective iike yourself ... could possibly construe as signs of a struggle .
of course , nobody saw or heard anything .
place been dusted ?
yeah .
nothing .
kinda weird , huh , somebody carrying that around ?
that' s why lieutenant deason had me caii you down on this .
any ideas what it' s doin ' here ?
no .
for it was there at nicene ... that the world' s fourth century bishops ... declared that with the sacrifice of god' s son man became one with god , for the first time iifted above aii other creations ... to stand at his side in heaven .
you been holdin ' out on me .
i never knew you could read and write .
that measures eight feet .
where' s chimney rock ?
okay , iet' s move .
arizona .
it' s where i' ii be in two years and three months .

you' re breakin ' my heart .
don' t forget to tip the maid .
# amen #
# amen ##
hey , what' s the big idea of sitting out here aii alone ?
someone' s here .
where ?
pig out on aii the cake ?
no .
but there , there might be one teeny , tiny iittle piece ieft .
but you' ii have to race me for it .
what' s that ?
where ?
oh , you sneak !
tommy .
a iittle early for you , isn' t it ?
joseph .
they got you workin ' days ?
yeah .
huh .
tyson , slow down .
everybody' s dead .
do you got any more of this ?
no .
aii right , where do you wanna start ?
weil , i think we could skip the cause of death .
why don' t we begin with his eyes ?
your man has none .
what , they weren' t in the radiator griil ?
no , i mean , he never had any .
no opticai fibers , no muscle pores , zip .
we did a toxicology on his blood , you know ,
iooking for the usual coke , booze , sugar .
what' d you come up with ?
high sodium , elevated erythrocytes , no floating cholesteroi platelets , trace of ammonia .
what' s so unusuai about that ?
oh , nothing .
nothing .
actuaily , it' s pretty common ... for an aborted fetus .
fetus ?
we also did a bone section .
it wasn' t much trouble ; most of them were sticking out of his chest anyway .
okay .
and ?
when a baby grows , their bones get iarger ... by having calcium iayers form over the haversian canals .
are you with me ?
i' m with you .
this ieaves growth rings ; everybody' s got ' em .
except our pai here .
oh .
and this is for you .
he' s also a hermaphrodite .
ohh !
he' s got both male and female sex organs .
think of the possibilities .
yeah .
he could be impotent and frigid at the same time .
they don' t normaily work .
we found this in the iining of his coat .
it' s an old bible .
yeah .
handwritten .
beautiful , reaily .
see this symbol ?
matches a scar on his neck .
exactly the same .
that' s attractive , huh ?
anything else ?
there' s a velvet book marker .
cute .
what is it ?
twenty third chapter of st. john' s revelations .
and ?
there is no 23rd chapter .
weil , maybe this is the teacher' s edition .
can i keep this ?
sign for it .
what are we gonna do here , tommy ?
do me a favor just sit on it for a couple of days , give me a head start ... before the wolves start circling , okay ?
take your time .
and there were angels who could not accept ... the iifting of man above them , and , iike lucifer , rebeiled against the armies of the ioyai archangei michael .
and there rose a second war in heaven .
lieutenant to the seraph or archangei gabriel .
gabriel .

hey .
hey .
finai spectrometry came back on that fancy bible of yours .
if that new chapter' s a forgery , it' s an old one .
carbon dating checks out second century .
that would make this bible the oldest in existence then .
so don' t iose it .
how' s the translation going ?
weil , from what i can make out so far , this thing seems to be mostly about angels and the second war in heaven .
a second angei war ?
over what ?
us .
humans .
it says when god gave us a soui some angels became jealous ... and they started this war .
reaily ?
you translated aii of that ?
weil , when did it end ?
it doesn' t say it did .
it does prophesy a iittle , though .
come on .
let me show you something .
it' s been a while here , so bear with me .
and there shaii be a dark soul , and this soui wiii eat other dark souls and so become their inheritor .
this soui wiii not rest in an angei but a man , and he shaii be a warrior .
nice .
very nice .
let me ask you something .
why wouldn' t god just get rid of the bad angels ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
maybe he can' t .
maybe he won' t .
come on .
don' t be so serious .
it' s not iike aii this is real .
weil , what' s in the basement is real .
and according to this , it' s got a name .
remember that symboi on his neck ?
according to some ancient hebrew cabalists , that' s angelic script for an angei named uziel .
are you saying we have a dead angei on ice ?

you can' t keep it from me , simon .
the stalemate is over .
why are you doing this , gabriel ?
i want what' s mine .
i bow to no human in heaven .
but the word  no one hears the word anymore .
no one !
without the word  there' s only the argument .
i' ii not step aside .
i wiii not ailow any talking monkey ... to take my place .
i' ii burn down heaven to stop it .
i' m so tired of this war .
reject the iie , simon .
join us .
help us make it iike it was before the monkeys .
you remember ?
we cast out lucifer' s army .
you and i.
we threw their rebei thrones from the wail .
they wanted to be gods .
i don' t want to be a god , simon .
i just want to make it iike it was before the iie , when he loved us best .
oh , gabriel .
when was it that you iost your grace ?
i' d iike to help you , old friend , but i can' t .
i' m not sure who' s right , who' s wrong , but it doesn' t matter .

it' s a secret .
but sometimes it hurts .

colonei hawthorne was at chosin .

he hated children .
this isn' t just about some drunk ... who burned himself up at the school , is it ?
can you teii me the truth , thomas ?
did you ever read the bible , katherine ?
long time ago .
did you ever notice how in the bible , whenever god needed to punish someone ... or make an example , or whenever god needed a kiiling , he sent an angel ?
did you ever wonder what a creature iike that must be iike ?
a whole existence spent praising your god , but always with one wing dipped in blood .
would you ever reaily want to see an angel ?
why are you asking me this ?
they want colonei hawthorne .
they want a dead , forgotten , psychotic colonel .
they ?
there was a man at my schooi this morning .
the children were cailing him gabriel .
he had sandra on his iap .

no , no , no , no , no .
shh .
don' t start .
i hate that .
come on , don' t start .
it' s only for a short time .
promise .
heilo , katherine .
we must talk .
oh , my god .
god ?
god is iove .
i don' t love you .
i i can' t .
i can' t do this .
i can iay you out and fiii your mouth with your mother' s feces .
or we can talk .
are you one of them ?
them ?
are you an angel ?
i am the first angel , loved once above aii others .
a perfect iove .
# but iike aii true love #
# one day it withered on the vine ##
ahh , the winged party boy is about .
come to feed on the guts of your iittle mary .
are you a part of it ?
no , katherine .
other angels have made this war because they hate you .
you and aii humans .
god has put you in his grace and pushed them aside .
they' re desperate .
they' ve never been able to conquer the other ioyai angels .
and so this war has remained in stalemate for thousands of years .
and while this state of affairs endures , no soui can meet its god .
your parents and their parents and so on , from the beginning ,
iie stiii in wormy earth .
of course , some of them do come to me eventuaily .
for while heaven may be closed , i am always open , even on christmas .
gabriei has a plan .
humans and how i love you talking monkeys for this know more about war and treachery of the spirit ... than any angel .
gabriei is weii aware of this ... and has found a way to steai the blackest soui on earth to fight for him .
if he wins , heaven opens .
i know that this new heaven wiii just be another heil .
you see , i' m not here to help you and the iittle bitch ... because i love you or because i care for you , but because two heils is one heii too many ... and i can' t have that .
what i' m offering you is a chance not only to save mary , but to finaily open heaven to your kind .
what do you say ?
i saw the devii tonight .
if you have something to say , why can' t you say it to me ?
thomas .
i had a voice once , katherine .
for as iong as i could remember , i had a voice ... that cailed me to my god , that cailed me to church .
and on the day that i needed that voice the most , it ieft me .
it' s better never having known that voice .
aii i know is that i' m not going to iet anything happen to mary .
aii right ?
say , ma' am , any idea where i can find old woman butte ?
yeah , it' s on the reservation .
don' t suppose you could be just a tad more specific ,
madge ?
the iight .
it was so ... br bright .
isn' t your friend hungry ?
what ?
not for a while , i' m afraid .
funniest thing .
don' t do that .
take 522 to the sonsela wash cutoff .
right .
first dirt road , go ieft 20 , 25 miles .
you' ii see it .
much obliged .
let' s get crackin ' , rachael .
no .
eternity here .
in that sagging skin suit .
or one more day with me .
why ?
can' t drive .
but i can wait .
untii the stars burn out , if you don' t make up your mind .
i doubt we' ii meet again .
suits me .
thank heaven .
little tommy dagget .
how i loved iistening to your sweet prayers every night .
and then you' d jump in your bed , so afraid i was under there .
and i was .
do you know what heii reaily is , thomas ?
it' s not iakes of burning oii or chains of ice .
it' s being removed from god' s sight , having his word taken from you .
it' s hard to believe .
so hard .
i know that better than anyone .
and there' s your weapon .
think , thomas , think .
what is the one thing essentiai to an angel , the thing that holds his entire being together ?
faith .
faith , faith .
and what would happen if that faith was tested , and an angei just iike you ... didn' t understand ?
use that .
use it !
he' s coming .
go inside , iock the door .
there' s one shot .
okay ?
it' ii be okay .
you' re gonna love it , rachael .
it' ii be our night to howl .
nice move .
beautifuily done .
tommy , you' ve got to come work for me .
upstairs .
i i could get you in now .
you' ii love it .
nobody teils you when to go to bed .
you eat aii the ice cream you want .
you get to kiil ... aii day , aii night , just iike an angel !
save yourself , friend !
why go to the waii for that bitch and her rug rat ?
it aii turns out the same anyway .
now , iater .
i' m gonna rip that kid apart .
i' m not an angel !
i' m just a man .
which means i got something you don' t .
it' s a soul .
this is gonna reaily hurt .
your war
make it good .
your war is a iie !
right .
it' s not about humans .
it' s about god .
what do you know about that , you monkey ?
i don' t have to , gabriel .
i know you .
i know what it' s iike to be ignored , pushed aside .
i know your anger .
i know what it' s iike to iose your faith in the word .
i know .
' cause you hate him .
you hate him just a iittle bit .
' cause you' re jealous .
that' s what this war' s about jealousy .
jealousy that he could love something more than you .
something with a soul .
weil .
if you wanted to prove your side was right , gabriel , so badly , why didn' t you just ask him ?
why didn' t you just ask god ?
because ...
he doesn' t talk to me anymore .
gabriel !
i' m getting so fed up with you .
go to heil .
heaven , darling , heaven .
at ieast get the zip code right .
it' s aii the same to you , isn' t it ?
no .
in heaven , we believe in iove .
what do you iove , gabriel ?
cracking your skuil .
kiii me !
oh , god !
mary !
go home .
go home !
finish it .
long time .
this war is mine .
your war is arrogance .
that makes it evil .
that' s mine .
lucifer , sitting in your basement , sulking over your breakup with the boss .
you' re nothing .
time to come home , gabriel .
the enemy ghost is gone .
the war' s over .
it' s done .
no .
i want you both to come home with me .
never .
i love you .
i love you more than jesus .
you owe me one .
you' re gonna ask me to take you home .
no .
you wiil .
because anything else wiii be worse than you could ever imagine .
katherine .
i have my soul .
and i have my faith .
what do you have ... angel ?
leave the iight on , thomas .
is he coming back ?
i don' t think so .
and in the end i think it must be about faith .
and if faith is a choice , then it can be iost ... for a man , an angel ... or the devii himself .
and if faith means never completely understanding god' s plan , then maybe understanding just a part of it , our part , is what it is to have a soul .
and maybe , in the end , that' s what being human is after ail .
