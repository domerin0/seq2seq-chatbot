right , but ... ... the mindanao rebels have fought the government ... ... for more than 30 years .
now suddenly , you' ve decided they' re akd ?
why ?

general lewis , here .
congratulations , general .
your special ops team was shot down before they got near the target .
you lost two rescue choppers .
and apparently , the survivors were taken hostage .
oh , jesus christ .
what was that ?
i said we have a bad line , sir .
this is a total command failure .
embarrassing .
we believed our intelligence to be good .
we based our strategy on it .
the enemy doesn' t always do what you want them to do .
they have a choice too .
damn right .
and what do you think they' re gonna do ... ... to captured american soldiers ?
how do you think the american public is going to react to a video of ...

i wouldn' t want my wife to be in a mess like this .
well ... ... maybe that' s why i haven' t found him yet .
yeah .
you know ... ... it was really brave of you to come back for me .
thanks .
when the opportunity presents itself ... ... you have to escape .
i' m in no shape to go with you .
all right .
don' t you wanna get some sleep , sir ?
i just wanna get these done .
get them back to the families .
lieutenant montalvo' s looking for you .
says we got new orders .
when we heard the choppers ... ...
i knew i had a chance to escape .
but then i met abubakar .
the man we were sent to catch .
all right .
rebels shot down three of our helicopters in less then one hour .
flyboys can' t get in there , so they' re calling in the grunts .
high altitude recon shows nothing left of the team ... ... so we' re looking for survivors from eagle one .
that' s the ranger squad under major diego aginaldo .
and two americans .
special ops coordinator lieutenant mark pierce ... ... and captain amy jennings , pilot out of 3rd tactical .
the main force will be pursuing rebel leadership .
but they' re going the same place we are .
so we' re gonna take the river .
get up ahead of them , deep in rebel territory .
general bondoc' s 2nd army is pushing a group of rebels ... ... up from the south .
that means we' ve got ... ... two prongs ... ... squeezing a whole bunch of rebels right where we' re going .
our job is to get there first ... ... and get our marines back .
brief your fire teams .
we move out in ten mikes .
lieutenant .
what were they doing out here ?
who' s that ?
the rangers and that chick pilot .
that pilot is a marine aviator and a superior officer .
no offense , sir ... ... but i won' t even let my old lady drive my car .
she was a counterinsurgency specialist .
hq sent them out here to capture one of the rebel leaders .
abubakar al hassan ... ... al qaeda' s number two in southeast asia .
let' s get the men ashore .
take cover .
lieutenant daniels .
lieutenant reyes , philippine army .
we were two days ahead of schedule ... ... until they started hitting our flank .
sounds like a trap .
the rest of the air support and divisions ... ... are tied up about 5 klicks back .
what about you guys ?
looking for a huey that went down in delta five .
that' s just the other side of this mess .
damn , they' ve got the range .
how about the back side ?
it' s mined .
jackson .

and so will you .
abaya .

tell him we found major aginaldo' s body .
yes , sir .
cooper , move out .
don' t wanna think about what they' re doing to captain jennings .

coop , what about you ?
i got a road leading up .
what do you think ?
i think straight up .
we' il try to get a view from a high point .
if we can' t see anything ... ... at least we' ve got a defensible bivouac for the night .
all right .
all right , we' re going up .
move out .
what do you mean he' s not in hq ?
he' s not here , sir .
can you find him ?
no .
no ?
well , then , where is the general ?
that' s classified information , sir .
roger that .
alpha out .
worthless .
they rolled up hq .

last we heard , abubakar was taking her in that direction .
we' re not out here to let her slip away .
that bastard .
he' s got her .
until we get other orders ... ... we' ve got a soldier to save .
let' s pack it up .
move it out .
looks like one of ours .
it' s a dray .
cooper , go .
go , go .
moving out .
damn , looks like they' ve got a lot of firepower out here .
they must have moved up the assault .
jackson , talk to a supply sergeant .

roger that , sir .
how are you doing , sir ?
hey .

sir , where are those troops going ?
same place we are , coop .
all right .
this is it .
the place they' re holding captain jennings .
right here .
it' s heavily fortified and crawling with bogeys .
general al fatwa' s training camp .
there' s only one road into it ... ... and general panlilo' s taking the main force right up it .
air support is committed to a rebel reinforcement column ... ... moving down the back side of these mountains .
until the main force gets there , it' s just us and a whole lot of them .
this is general rashid al fatwa .
he runs the camp .
and intel' s latest photo of our old buddy abubakar .
they' ve got captain jennings .
we' re gonna get her out .
intel says abubakar' s made an alliance ... ... with the remnants of another rebel group .
that leaves us the hills to the south .
impassable for trucks and heavy armor .
so we' re hoofing it .
general says the main force is moving out at zero nine ... ... so we' re gonna have to haul ass to get to that camp .
any questions ?
make sure you guys chow down , have some water ... ... move out in five mikes .
let' s go get our marine back .
who' s leading the column ?
twenty three , apc .
they move in five minutes .
if they move in five minutes , we' il give ... ... daniels and montalvo a 15 minute head start , at the most .
what if we delay the artillery ?
save you a few good men .
orders are orders , general , but ... ... the pentagon can kiss my ass .
there' s a watchtower .
good eyes , cooper .
all right .
let' s try to get through that .
cut to the right .
right here , single file .
roger that , sir .
the main force should be moving already .
means the base is on the other side .
let' s see if we can get over there undetected .
where is to come ?
when will be attack ?
no .
don' t .
please ?
i don' t know .
when will be attack ?
i don' t know .
tell me .
i don' t know .
