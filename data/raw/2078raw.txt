please check the latest gattaca bulletin .
jerome .
is this the approach path we discussed ?
absolutely , director .
quite right .
listen to what i' m saying to you , i want what i ordered .
it' s a completely different colour .
no .
i' m bored of talking to you .
i' m bored .
i' il call you back .
that was the company that sell us your hair dye .
they' ve sent me ' summer wheat ' instead of ' honey dawn ' .
any full tone is two shades light .
' why don' t you try a change ? '
i don' t want to change !
we can' t use a change !
now i' il probably gonna have to pay for the 5 boxes they' ve sent me .
we can' t stay here .
the idiots i have to deal with , you wouldn' t believe !
they think i killed the mission director .
what makes them think that ?
they found my eyelash .
where ?
in the corridor .
well , that could be worse .
they could have found it in your eye .
they' ve got my picture posted up all over the place .
i can' t turn around without seeing my own face .
they' il recognize me .
they won' t recognize you .
they will recognize me !
i don' t recognize you .
they won' t marry the eyelash to you , they won' t believe that one of their elite could' ve suckered them all this time .
no , no , no , we change nothing we do as we planned .
you' re jerome morrow , navigator 1st class .
i' m not jerome morrow .
i' m a murder suspect .
what are you doing ?
that' s more than a day' s worth !
wait .
we can' t stay here .
stop that !
oh fine , fine !
you leave if you want .
but you' re not taking that stuff .
that stuff is mine !
i could' ve rented myself somebody with a spine
if i' d known you' d go belly up on me at the last fuckin ' gasp .
you can' t quit on me now .
i' ve put too much into this .
what do you want me to do ?
wheel in there and finish the job myself ?
eugene , they are going to find me .
you still don' t understand , do you ?
when they look at you , they don' t see you any more .
they only see me .
keep your lashes on your lids where they belong .
how could you be so careless ?
i' m going out .
where are you going ?
well if i' m gonna get arrested tomorrow , i' m gonna go out tonight .
are you sure that' s a good idea to go out ?
that was your idea not to change anything .
who' s going ?
i' d say everybody .
if i don' t go that will look suspicious .
you don' t want to look suspicious , do you ?
thanks .
who ordered this ?
what are we doing here ?
i' m following a lead .
forgive me , sir but that' s what i do .
i' m a detective .
i follow leads .
why makes you think the owner of the eyelash is here ?
he' s an in valid , sir .
where do we look for in valids
but where in valids are .
he' s an in valid .
he' s an in valid clever enough to go unregistered all these years .
do you think he' s likely to lie down for us now ?
what do you suggest , sir ?
move the inquiry back to the scene .
draw 5 miles radius around gattaca , sweep again .
random stops .
you' re a navigator ?
at gattaca ?
that' s what it says , doesn' t it ?
it doesn' t say you' re crippled .
i' m not crippled .
i hurt my leg training , you moron .
how dare you question me ?
what' s your number ?
forget it .
no , what' s your number , you fucking flatfoot !
i said forget it .
what do you want ?
an apology ?
it gets to you , doesn' t it .
it gets to you that i can do what you can only dream of .
i' m getting off this ball of dirt !
how dare you question me !
that' s harassment .
my mistake .
what' s your number ?
what' s your number ?
may i remind you that this is a crime scene .
what' s this man doing here ?
what are you doing , old man ?
doing my job , sir .
this is evidence .
but it' s just trash .
you didn' t know ?
oh yes , yeah .
wonderful , wasn' t it ?
12 fingers or 1 , it' s how you play .
that piece can only be played with 12 .
what' s all this about ?
it' s probably nothing .
no , you better not .
i don' t want to give you a contaminated specimen .
get my meaning ?
thanks .
you never know where those swabs have been .
i want to show you something .
come on , we' il miss it .
come on .
we' il miss it .
what did i tell you ?
strange .
your eyes look different .
i guess it must be the light .
must be .
positive match .
i' m impressed .
the cup was definitely used since the original sweep ?
two samples , two days .
either the suspect went back to the scene of the crime to get a drink of water and i don' t know anybody that thirsty .
or he still works there .
i thought we checked all the service staff .
i don' t think he cleans up the place any more .
i have a feeling he might be there on a false pretense , playing somebody else' s hair .
a borrowed ladder at gattaca ?
that' s far fetched , but is not out of a possibility .
i find it hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers .
even if he got past their security system , he wouldn' t have the mental faculty or the physical stamina .
maybe you' re underestimating .
maybe he is an imposter and maybe the director found out about it .
that could be his motive .
i say we sample every employee within the parameters intravenously .
2/ 3 of their workforce fall in that category .
we' d be closing them down for days .
no , a fingertip sample or a urine should be sufficient .
i suggest blood from the vein .
i hope i' m not out of line .
it' s only a matter of time , sir .
only a matter of time .
what' s with the plungers , lamar ?
you' re openin' up a blood bank ?
only the gentlemen from the law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods have been compromised .
goddamn !
i' m sorry .
are you out of practice , lamar ?
let me look at that .
it' s all right .
luckily , it looks as though we have enough .
well if you need any more , you can always get it off his shoes .
irene .
so you didn' t do it after all ?
no , i guess somebody beat me to it .
i guess .
i leave in two days .
i guess you know that .
but . . .
that' s the last .
something' s not right .
he' s not here .
it' s a blind out .
no , we miss something .
i say we test again .
test ?
i cannot allow you to disrupt our operations any further .
you' re not at all concerned about having a murderer in your midst ?
right now , your presence is creating more of a threat .
the window for our latest launch is open for seven days once every 70 years .
so it' s rather crucial we leave on time .
mission means a great deal to you , doesn' t it ?
and your late colleague opposed it .
didn' t he ?
take another look at my profile , detective .
you won' t find a violent bone in my body .
my apologies , director .
he won' t trouble you any further .
this is not the only place we can look .
okay .
let' s start making the rounds .
i' m luckier than most .
not as lucky as some .
i know something about that .
you , jerome ?
what heart problem did you ever have ?
did you get yours broken once ?
i had this crazy idea that you were more interested in the murder case than me .
you' re right .
that' s a crazy idea .
would you like to dance ?
it' s funny .
you work so hard , you do everything you can to get away from a place . . .
and when you finally get your chance to leave , you find a reason to stay .
a year is a long time .
not so long .
just once around the sun .
hello , everyone , nice to see you , i' m your detective for the evening .
please don' t leave the premises .
i said nobody leave !
am i speaking in some kinda strange foreign language ?
check the hands , lenses , dentures , napkins , i want cigarette butts , the saliva off tea cups .
that' s a familiar face .
check him out .
i thought you wanted to dance .
where are you going ?
oh yeah let me just ...
jerome !
are you insane ?
come on !
where did they go ?
where did they go ?
come on .
don' t you understand , i can' t do that !
shh , you just did .
don' t touch your face .
don' t swallow .
don' t spit .
let' s clean his teeth .
vincent !
vincent !
who' s vincent ?
i. . .
don' t say anything .
don' t say anything .
what happened ?
the scars on your legs ?
you remember the ' 99 chrysler lebaron ?
this is the exact height of the front fender .
looked left instead of right .
did you just make that up or do you use all the time ?
i use it all the time .
i know you had something to do with the director' s death .
that' s not true , irene .
isn' t that the man from last night ?
he' s nobody .
he' s one of our best .
i' m certain he has nothing to do with this business .
jerome morrow .
you don' t look well , jerome .
why don' t you go home ?
can i help you ?
i' m looking for jerome morrow .
i' m sorry , he' s ill .
a little nausea .
it' s quite common before a mission .
i oughta pay him a visit .
i understand you can show me the way ?
you don' t know who he is , do you , irene ?
hello ?
eugene , i need you to be yourself for the day .
i was never very good at it , remember ?
the investigators are coming by .
i' m supposed to be sick .
so you keep telling me ?
how long have i got ?
not long .
i guess he' s not home .
i' m here to see jerome morrow .
yes that' s me .
come up .
i guess he' s home .
come in .
come in .
come in .
hello , sweetheart .
where is my kiss ?
good to see you' re feeling better .
of course , now that you' re here .
who' s your friend ?
how can i help ?
it' s about the director .
again ?
i hope it' s no trouble .
no , no , no trouble .
forgive me for not giving your guided tour .
can' t we do this another time ?
this won' t take a moment .
maybe he can tell me what i have got .
who were you expecting ?
yes ?
we have our man , sir .
you have him ?
we have him in custody .
i' il come right away .
how are you , jerome ?
not bad , jerome .
how the hell did you get up here ?
i can always walk .
i' ve been faking it .
irene . . .
don' t touch me !
listen to me , irene !
i don' t even know who you are .
i' m the same person i was yesterday .
i can' t hear anymore of your lies , jerome .
my name is vincent , vincent anton freeman .
and i' m a faith birth or a de gene erate or whatever you wanna call it .
but i' m not a murderer .
you' re a god child ?
well we do have one thing in common .
only i don' t have 20 30 years left in mine .
mine is already 10, 000 beats overdue .
it' s not possible .
you are the authority on what is not possible ,
aren' t you , irene ?
they' ve got you looking so hard for any flaw , that after a while that' s all that you see .
for whatever it' s worth , i' m here to tell you that it is possible .
it is possible .
congratulations , sir .
we did it .
his spit was found in the dead director' s eye .
an unaccounted specimen .
while i was busy obsessing about an eyelash , your instincts took us in the right direction .
so the in valid had nothing to do with this ?
no , our friend here acted alone .
this mission meant everything to him , didn' t it ?
he knows that if they miss this launch window he wouldn' t live to see the next one .
and since nothing can stop the launch now , he' s being very , very cooperative .
so , i imagin you' il be celebrating tonight , sir ?
of course .
i think she likes us .
yeah , sure , just give her a little time and she' il get used to the idea .
what was he like ?
who , the cop ?
yeah .
he was just a cop .
did you catch his name ?
actually my name was the topic of conversation .
yeah well , he' il be back .
you heard what he said , they have their man .
it' s over .
no , it' s not over .
i have to meet him .
vincent ?
my god , you have changed .
has it been so long , you don' t recognize your own brother ?
are we brothers ?
our parents both died thinking they' d outlived ya .
i had my doubts .
what are you doing here , anton ?
i should ask you that question .
i have a right to be here .
you don' t .
you almost sound as if you believe that .
i committed no murder .
you must be disappointed .
you committed fraud .
listen , you' re in a lot of trouble , vincent .
i can get you out of here .
do you have any idea what it took to get in here ?
you' ve gone as far as you can go .
you come with me now !
there' s still a few million miles left to go .
it' s over .
is that the only way you can succeed , is to see me fail ?
i' m telling you ...
god !
even you are going to tell me what i can and can' t do now ?
in case you haven' t noticed , i don' t need any rescuing .
but you did , once .
you' ve got all the answers , how do you explain that ?
you didn' t beat me that day .
i beat myself .
who are you trying to convince ?
do you want me to prove it to you ?
it' s not important , anton .
it' s forgotten .
i' il prove it to you .
do you want me to prove it to you ?
i' il prove it to you !
i do .
vincent !
vincent !
where' s the shore ?
we' re too far out !
do you wannna quit ?
we' re too far out !
do you wanna quit ?
no .
vincent !
how are you doing this , vincent ?
how have you done any of this ?
we have to go back .
no .
it' s too late for that .
we' re close to the other side .
what other side ?
do you want to drown us both ?
you want to know how i did it ?
this is how i did it , anton .
i never saved anything for the swim back .
you couldn' t see , could you ?
that night , crossing the street .
you crossed anyway .
if you' re still interested , let me know .
sorry . . .
the wind caught it .
you' re flying today , aren' t you ?
look at what a mess you' re in .
come on , i have your samples ready .
i don' t need any samples where i' m going .
you might when you get back .
everything you need to last you two lifetimes .
why have you done all this ?
so jerome will always be here when you need him .
where are you going ?
i' m travelling , too .
i don' t know how to thank you .
no , no . . .
i got the better end of the deal .
i only lent you my body .
you lent me your dream .
until you' re upstairs .
what is this ?
new policy .
flight got you nervous ?
there' s a problem , lamar .
i never did tell you about my son , did i ?
he' s a big fan of yours .
just remember that i was as good as any and better than most .
he wants to apply here .
i could have gone up and back and nobody wouldn' t have been the wiser .
unfortunately , my son' s not all that they promised .
but then , who knows what he could do ?
right ?
for future reference , right handed men don' t hold it with their left .
just one of those things .
you' re going to miss your flight , vincent .
for someone who was never meant for this world ,
i must confess , i' m suddenly having a hard time leaving it .
of course , they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star .
maybe i' m not leaving .
maybe i' m going home .
