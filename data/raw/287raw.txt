yeah ?
my lord .
she' s here .
how could you do this to me ?
embarrass me like this ?
the entire coven knows that i had plans for us .
there is no us !
you' il go before viktor ... ... and tell him exactly what i tell you to !
from here on out , you' il do as i say .
is that in any way unclear ?
come closer , my child .
outside .
come on , move it .
i' ve been lost without you , my lord .
constantly hounded by kraven and his never ending infatuation .
it is the oldest story in the book .
he desires the one thing he cannot have .
now , tell me ... ... why have you come to believe that lucian still lives ?
yeah .
i' ve given you all the proof you need .
incoherent thoughts and images , nothing more .
which is precisely why the awakening is performed by an elder .
you do not possess the necessary skills .
but i did see lucian .
i shot him .
you must believe me .
the chain has never been broken .
not once .
not in 14 centuries .
not since we elders first began to leapfrog through time .
one awake , two asleep .
that' s the way of it .
it is marcus ' turn to reign , not mine .
there' s been a complication .
but i had no choice .
the coven is in danger , and michael is the key ...
yes .
the lycan .
please .
give me the chance to get proof you require .
fine .
i will leave it to kraven to collect the proof ... ... if there is any .
how could you trust him over me ?
because he is not the one who has been tainted by an animal .
i love you ... ... like a daughter , but you leave me with no choice .
these rules are in place for a good reason ... ... and they are the only reason we have survived this long .
you will not be shown an ounce of leniency .
when amelia arrives , the council will convene and decide your fate .
you have broken the chain and the covenant !
you must be judged !
you should' ve listened to me and stayed out of this .
now you' il be lucky if i can convince the council to spare your life .
tell me .
did you have the nerve to cut the skin from his arm , or did lucian do it ?
mark my words .
soon , you' il be seeing things my way .
no one opens this door .
understood ?
i can' t afford to have my future queen run off with that lycan again .
shit .
change of plans .
amelia will be picked up by soren and his team .
that' s our job .
not anymore .
why are you helping me ?
i' m not .
i' m helping me .
what' s going on ?
the perimeter sensor' s been tripped .
we' re locking down the mansion .
it' s selene .
she' s escaped , to go to him , to michael .
i want that lycan' s head on a plate .
we need to go .
get down !
go .
go .
jump .
are you fucking kidding me ?
any luck ?
false alarm .
the dogs would' ve been all over it if anything had gotten near that fence .
amelia should have arrived by now .
yes .
look , i want you to slip off the property and find out what' s keeping her .
you' ve got it .
maybe we should pull over and dose him .
fuck him .
he' il be all right .
we' re almost there .
oh , shit .
he' s not gonna make it .
pull over .
pull over !
get the kit .
stick him .
stick him .
my lord .
viktor wants to speak with you .
my lord .
i sent for selene ... ... not you .
she' s defied your orders ... ... and fled the mansion , my lord .
your incompetence is becoming most taxing .
it' s not my fault .
she' s become obsessed ... ... thinks that i' m at the core of some ridiculous conspiracy .
and here' s my proof .
now , i want you to tell them exactly what you told me .
all right , all right .
we' ve been searching for someone with a special trait .
a direct descendant of alexander corvinus ... ... hungarian , a warlord ... ... who came to power in the early seasons of the fifth century .
just in time to watch a plague ravage his village .
he alone survived .
somehow , his body was able to change the disease ... ... mold it to his benefit .
he became the first true immortal .
and years later , he fathered at least two children ... ... who inherited this same trait .
the sons of the corvinus clan .
one bitten by bat , one by wolf ... ... one to walk the ionely road of mortality as a human .
it' s a ridiculous legend .
nothing !
that may be ... ... but our species do have a common ancestor .
a mutation of the original virus ... ... is directly linked to his bloodline .
there is a descendant of corvinus lying there ... ... not three feet from you .
yes .
but he' s already a vampire .
we needed a pure source ... ... untainted .
an exact duplicate of the original virus ... ... which we learned ... ... was hidden away in the genetic code of his human descendants ... ... and passed along in its latent form ... ... down through the ages ... ... all the way to michael corvin .
for years , we tried to combine their bloodlines .
and for years we failed .
it was useless .
even at the cellular level , our species seemed destined to destroy each other .
that is , until we found michael .
the corvinus strain allows for a perfect union .
a triple celled platelet ... ... which holds unspeakable power .
there can be no such union .
and to speak of it is heresy .
we' il see .
once lucian has injected himself with michael' s blood .
lucian is dead .
according to whom ?
i need you to do something for me .
i can assure you , my child ... ... kraven will pay with his life .
soon , this house will lie in ruins .
not before you .
no , wait .
wait .
you and you alone will know the truth of this .
if lucian was able to get his hands on the blood of a pure born ... ... a powerful elder like amelia ... ... or yourself ... ... and inject it along with michael' s blood ...
abomination .
half vampire ... ... half lycan , but stronger than both .
i need to speak with kahn .
my lord ... ... the council members have been assassinated .
what of amelia ?
they bled her dry .
it has already begun .
i' m sorry i doubted you .
fear not , my child , absolution will be yours ... ... the moment you kill the descendant of corvinus , this ... ... michael .
you' ve been given an enzyme to stop the change .
it may take a little time for the grogginess to dissipate .
that' s enough !
just go and see what' s keeping raze , will you ?
i really must apologize .
he' s in desperate need of a lesson in manners .
speaking of manners , where are mine ?
forgive me .
i' m lucian .
i need to go .
i need to get back .
there' s no going back .
there' s no going anywhere .
the vampires will kill you on sight .
just for being what you are .
one of us .
you are one of us .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
bringing an end to this conflict .
your war , it has nothing to do with me .
my war ?
no !
no !
no !
no !
no !
no !
sonja !
they forced you to watch her die .
sonja .
that' s what started the war .
i saw it happen as if i were there .
we were slaves once .
the daylight guardians of the vampires .
i was born in servitude ... ... yet i harbored them no ill will .
i even took a vampire for my bride .
it was forbidden ... ... our union .
viktor feared a blending of the species .
feared it so much ... ... he killed her .
his own daughter ... ... burnt alive ... ... for loving me .
this is his war ... ... viktor' s ... ... and he' s spent the last 600 years ... ... exterminating my species .
what are they gonna do to selene ?
we have company .
i thought we had a deal .
patience .
kraven .
these are matters to be discussed in private .
please escort our guests downstairs .
the council has been destroyed .
soon , you will have it all .
both great covens and an ironclad peace treaty with the lycans .
who i trust will not be forgotten when the spoils are tabulated .
how do you expect me to assume control now that viktor' s awake ?
there' s no defeating him .
he grows stronger as we speak .
and that is precisely why i need michael .
if viktor were so easy to dispatch ... ... you' d have done it yourself centuries ago .
exit shaft !
move it !
son of a bitch !
oh , shit !
it' s viktor .
yes .
and if you had done your job , he' d still be in hibernation .
where the hell is raze ?
is there another way out ?
i guess it didn' t occur to you that you' il have to bleed to pull off this coup .
don' t even think about leaving .
silver nitrate .
bet you weren' t expecting that .
come on !
move !
move !
move !
move !
move !
lucian .
selene !
selene !
not yet .
i have to get you out .
viktor' s on his way .
and he won' t be satisfied until every lycan' s dead .
they' il kill you too , just for helping me .
i know .
i know what started the war .
that' s enough .
you' re coming with me !
i hope i live to see viktor choke the life from you !
i bet you do .
but let me tell you a little something about your beloved dark father .
he' s the one who killed your family .
not the lycans .
never could follow his own rules .
said he couldn' t abide the taste of livestock .
so every once in a while , he went out and gorged himself on human blood .
i kept his secrets ... ... cleaned up the mess .
but it was he ... ... who crept room to room ... ... dispatching everyone close to your heart .
but when he got to you ... ... he just couldn' t bear the thought of draining you dry .
you , who reminded him so much of his precious sonja ... ... the daughter he condemned to death .
lies .
believe what you want .
now come on .
your place is by my side .
so be it .
bite him !
half vampire ... ... half lycan ... ... but stronger than both .
what the hell are you doing ?
you may have killed me ... ... cousin .
but my will ... ... is done regardless .
where is he ?
where' s kraven ?
forgive me , my child .
it wasn' t the lycans .
it was you .
leave us .
how could you bear my trust ... ... knowing that you' d killed my family ?
yes .
i have taken from you .
but i have given so much more .
is it not a fair trade , the life i have granted you ?
the gift of immortality ?
and the life of your daughter ?
your own flesh and blood ?
i loved my daughter !
but the abomination growing in her womb ... ... was a betrayal of me and of the coven !
i did what was necessary to protect the species ... ... as i am forced to do yet again .
no !
time to die .
though i cannot predict the future ... ... the consequences of tonight will reverberate through the halls ... ... of both great covens for many years to come .
two vampire elders have been slain ... ... one by my own hand .
soon , marcus will take the throne .
and a tide of anger and retribution will spill out into the night .
differences will be set aside .
allegiances will be made .
and soon ... ... i will become the hunted .
