katie !
cora !
you love your sister ?
you make any noise , you know what happens .
good morning , estelle .
how am i looking , paul ?
that' s better .
that' s better .
morning , mr. edgecomb .
some danish ?
no , just two pieces of dry toast , hector .
thanks .
leftover' s fine .
dry and cold , same as always .
cold is better .
especially on those long walks .
am i right ?
don' t let nurse godzilla catch you .
she' il raise holy hell .
we' re not supposed to let you wander off .
where do you go every day ?
what do you do up in those hills ?
just walk .
i like to walk .
try not to fall down , bust a hip .
i don' t wanna be in no damn search party .
you want this man in your life ?
explain the moral basis of that .
i' ve made mistakes .
tony doesn' t admit that he' s not a good father .
you can' t ask nothing .
i have six kids myself .
why do we always watch this stuff ?
it' s interesting .
lnteresting ?
bunch of inbred trailer trash ?
all they ever talk about is fucking .
are you all right ?
you look tired .
you' re not yourself .
no , i' m fine .
i promise .
you' re wearing yourself out with those walks every day , i think .
not that you asked me .
i just didn' t sleep well , is all .
i had a few bad dreams .
it happens .
i' il be fine .
if madge doesn' t care , i certainly don' t .
neither do i.
now , this here is worth a look .
i' m in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find
the happiness i seek
when we' re out together
dancing cheek to cheek
heaven
i' m in heaven
and the cares that hung around me
through the week
seem to vanish
like a gambler' s lucky streak
paul , what is it ?
my god .
i' ve got to get out of here .
i guess sometimes the past just catches up with you ... ... whether you want it to or not .
it' s silly .
was it the film ?
it was , wasn' t it ?
i haven' t spoken of these things for a long time , ellie .
over 60 years .
paul , i' m your friend .
i ever tell you that i was a prison guard during the depression ?
you' ve mentioned it .
did i mention i was in charge of death row ?
that i supervised all the executions ?
usually , death row is called " the last mile .
we called ours " the green mile .
the floor was the color of faded limes .
we had the electric chair .
old sparky , " we called it .
i' ve lived a lot of years , ellie ... ... but 1 935 , that takes the prize .
that year , i had ... ... the worst urinary infection of my life .
it was ....
it was also the year of ... ... john coffey ... ... and the two dead girls .
put me through to e block .
e block .
right .
paul ?
prisoner .
christ , give me a minute .
you all right ?
for a man pissing razorblades , yeah .
you should' ve took the day off to see the doctor .
with the new arrival ?
you know better .
besides ... ... it' s not as bad as it was .
i think it' s clearing up .
let' s look alive , dean .
yes , sir .
damn .
they' re riding on the axle .
what' d they do ?
they bust the springs ?
dead man !
dead man walking !
we got a dead man walking here !
jesus please us , what is he yelling about ?
you might reconsider getting in the cell with this guy .
he' s enormous .
can' t be bigger than you .
dead man !
dead man walking !
dead man !
dead man walking !
dead man walking here !
dead man !
we got a dead man walking here !
dead man walking !
we got a dead man walking here !
percy .
that' s enough .
am i gonna have any trouble with you , big boy ?
can you talk ?
yes , sir , boss .
i can talk .
move your ass .
let' s go .
come on .
percy ... ... they' re moving house in the infirmary .
why don' t you go see if they could use some help ?
they got all the men they need .
why don' t you just make sure ?
i don' t care where you go , as long as it' s not here at this moment .
all right .
god , you bust my finger .
i wiped that grin off your face , didn' t l ?
goddamn it , percy , get the hell off my block !
fuck you , percy .
we' il get that looked at , del .
ln the meantime , stay quiet .
i let harry take those chains off you ... ... you gonna be nice ?
your name is john coffey .
yes , sir , boss .
like the drink , only not spelt the same .
you can spell , can you ?
just my name , boss .
j ... o
my name is paul edgecomb .
lf i' m not here , you can ask for mr. terwilliger ... ... mr. howell or mr. stanton .
these gentlemen right there .
questions ?
do you leave the light on after bedtime ?
because i get a little scared in the dark sometime ... ... if it' s a strange place .
it stays pretty bright around here all night long .
we keep a few lights burning in the corridor .
the corridor ?
right out there .
you can sit .
i couldn' t help it , boss .
i tried to take it back , but it was too late .
take delacroix to the infirmary , see if those fingers are broken .
of course they are .
i heard the bones crack .
you hear what he was yelling when we brought the dummy in ?
how could i miss it ?
the whole prison heard .
goddamn percy .
you' il have to answer for sending him off the mile .
i' il chew that food when i have to .
right now i wanna hear about this new inmate .
aside from how big he is .
monstrous big .
damn .
he seems meek enough .
ls he retarded , you figure ?
looks like they sent us an imbecile to execute .
lmbecile or not , he deserves to fry for what he done .
make your blood curdle .
what ? !
for god' s sake , what ?
the girls !
the girls are gone !
papa !
papa , look !
there' s blood .
oh , my god .
goddamn it , woman !
get on that phone .
you tell them we headed west .
you mind what i' m saying !
we headed west !
central !
are you on the line ?
oh , god , please .
somebody took my little girls .
katie !
cora !
jesus .
jesus .
i' il kill you !
i' il kill you !
i couldn' t help it .
i tried to take it back , but it was too late .
boy , you under arrest for murder .
i interrupt ?
well , i' m just about done .
how' s your pretty gal ?
melinda' s not so well , paul .
not so well at all .
more headaches ?
got laid up with another one yesterday .
worst one yet .
i' il be taking her over to vicksburg next day or so for some tests .
head x rays and who knows what else .
she is scared to death .
truth to tell , so am l .
lf it' s something they can see on the x ray ... ... maybe they can fix it .
maybe .
this just came in .
doe on bitterbuck .
you didn' t come down here to hand me a doe .
i had an angry call from the state capitol about 20 minutes ago .
ls it true you ordered percy wetmore off the block ?
it is .
now , i' m sure you had reason , paul ... ... but like it or not , the wife of the governor has only one nephew ... ... and his name is percy wetmore .
little percy calls his aunt ... ... and squeals like a schoolroom sissy .
he mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning out of sheer petulance ?
broke three fingers on eduard delacroix' s left hand .
i didn' t hear that .
i' m sure she didn' t either .
he is mean , careless and stupid ... ... and that' s a bad combination in a place like this .
sooner or later , he' il get somebody hurt or worse .
stick with it , paul .
it may not be much longer .
i have it on good authority that percy has an application in at briar ridge .
briar ridge ?
the mental hospital .
administration job .
better pay .
then why is he still here ?
he can get that application pushed through .
with his connections , he could have any state job he wants .
you know what i think ?
i think he just wants to see one cook up close .
well , he' il get his chance , then .
won' t he ?
maybe then he' il be satisfied and move on . ln the meantime ... ... you' il keep the peace ?
of course .
of course .
thank you , paul .
hal ... ... you give melinda my love , okay ?
i' m sure that x ray will turn out to be nothing at all .
you bet .
the music too loud ?
there' s just this empty spot in the bed where my husband sleeps .
he said to tell you he' s having a little trouble with that tonight .
worried about melinda and hal ?
ls that what' s got you up ?
yeah , that ... ... and things .
things .
we got a new inmate today .
simple minded fella .
do i wanna know what he did ?
no .
things that happen in this world .
it' s a wonder god allows it .
why don' t you come to bed ?
i think i have something that' il help you sleep .
you can have all you want .
i still got something wrong with my waterworks .
i don' t wanna pass it on to you .
have you seen doc bishop yet ?
no .
he' il want me to take sulfa tablets ... ... and i' il spend the week puking in my office .
it will run its course by itself .
thank you very much for your concern .
poor old guy .
the legislature loosened up the purse strings enough to hire on a new guard .
look again .
he' s right ... ... there .
it ain' t normal for a mouse to come up on people .
maybe it' s rabid .
oh , my christ .
it could be .
oh , the big mouse expert .
the mouse man .
you see him foaming at the mouth , mouse man ?
i don' t see its mouth at all .
brutal , we' il be hip deep in mice .
i just wanna see what he' il do .
ln the interest of science , like .
he' s in the damn restraint room .
he' s chewing the padding out of the walls ... ... making himself a nice little nest .
all right .
let' s go get the damn mouse .
boss .
saw me a mouse go by .
can' t put anything over on you .
you let him get past you .
no , i did not .
i been here all the time .
then where the hell is he ?
well , i don' t know .
three grown men ... ... outsmarted by a mouse .
bright side is , all this commotion probably scared him off for good .
yeah , that' s the last we' il see of him .
you little son of a bitch .
well , i' il be damned .
there he is , big as billy be frigged .
i thought brutal was pulling my leg .
that' s a goddamn mouse .
brute said he was in here last night ... ... begging for food .
he come right on up to the desk .
give him some room .
see what he does .
he' s a brave little bastard .
gotta give him that .
goddamn !
you little scurvy !
percy , are you crazy , you little son of a bitch ? !
i' m gonna kill you !
i' m gonna take you out !
you little vermin !
i' m gonna stomp your life out !
it' s just a little mouse , dumb merde .
you ugly little piece of sh
are you listening to me ?
fuck !
i' m gonna rip your diseased head off ... ... you little piece of shit !
percy met your mouse .
it' s in here somewhere .
i' m gonna squish the little son of a bitch .
percy , we already tried that .
what' d you say ?
i said that we
i knock yourself out .
hope you nail the bastard .
gosh .
he ain' t in there , huh ?
don' t that beat the mousy band ?
you wanna think about what you were doing ?
i was trying to get the mouse .
are you blind ?
you also scared the living crap out of me and bill ... ... not to mention the inmates .
so what ?
they aren' t in cradle school , case you didn' t notice .
although you treat them that way .
we don' t scare them any more than we have to .
they' re under enough strain .
men under strain can snap .
hurt themselves and hurt others .
that' s why our job is ... ... talking ... ... not yelling .
you' d do better to think of this place like an intensive care ward .
i think of it as a bucket of piss to drown rats in .
that' s all .
anybody doesn' t like it ?
you can kiss my ass .
you try it .
go on .
try it .
you' il be on the bread lines before the week is out .
okay , brutal .
we all know who your connections are .
you ever threaten a man on this block again , we all gonna have a go .
job be damned .
you done ?
get all this shit back in the room .
you are cluttering up my mile .
arlen ... ... your daughter and her family are here .
let' s move .
i want at least two rehearsals before he gets back .
sitting down , sitting down !
rehearsing now !
everybody settle !
arlen bitterbuck , step forward .
stepping forward , stepping forward , stepping forward .
ls his head properly shaved ?
it' s all dandruffy , and it smells .
i will take that as a yes .
let' s go , arlen .
walking the mile , walking the mile ... ... walking the mile , walking the mile , walking the mile ... ... walking the mile .
i' m getting to my knees .
i' m praying , praying .
lord is my shepherd and so forth and so on .
i' m sorry for all the bad shit i' ve done and people i' ve tramped on .
and i hope they forgive me ... ... and i' il never do it again , that' s for sure .
we' re not gonna have some cherokee medicine man in here ... ... hollering and shaking his dick .
actually  still praying , still praying .
getting right with jesus .
do it quietly !
you old gink !
as i was saying ... ... i don' t believe they actually shake their dicks .
mr. bitterbuck is a christian , so reverend schuster' s coming in .
he' s good .
he' s fast too .
doesn' t get them all worked up .
on your feet , toot .
you prayed enough for one day .
getting to my feet !
walking the mile ... ... walking the mile , walking the green mile .
walking the mile .
walking in the mile .
sitting down now .
sitting down .
i' m taking a seat in old sparky .
what do i do ?
watch and learn .
getting strapped .
getting clamped .
getting wired .
all right .
getting all electrode .
roll on one .
roll on one " means i turn the generator up full .
the lights go brighter in half the prison .
arlen bitterbuck ... ... you' ve been condemned to die by a jury ... ... sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state .
anything to say before your sentence is carried out ?
i want fried chicken with gravy on the taters , and i want to shit in your hat .
i got to have mae west sit on my face ... ... because i' m one horny motherfucker .
you bastard .
that' s a good one .
quiet .
quiet !
shut up !
shut up !
sorry , boss .
one more remark like that , i' il have van hay roll on two for real .
and i' il have one less crazy old trustee .
it was pretty funny .
i don' t like it .
we' il be doing this for real .
i don' t want anybody remembering a stupid joke and getting going again .
ever try not to laugh in church ... ... when something funny gets stuck in your head ?
i' m sorry , paul .
you' re right .
let' s keep going .
soak the sponge .
putting on the black hood .
and putting on my cap .
why' s he putting that sponge on his head ?
conducts electricity to the brain fast like a bullet .
you don' t ever throw the switch on a man without that .
hush up there , toot .
getting screwed .
i' m getting the cap .
arlen bitterbuck ... ... electricity shall be passed through your body until you are dead ... ... in accordance with state law .
god have mercy on your soul .
amen .
roll on two .
and that' s that .
i' m frying !
i' m frying !
i' m a done tom turkey !
this is a shocking experience !
one of the witnesses showed up a day early .
let' s do it again , and let' s get it right this time .
get that idiot out of the chair .
do you think if a man sincerely repents on what he done wrong ... ... that he might get to go back to the time that was happiest for him ... ... and live there forever ?
could that be what heaven' s like ?
i just about believe that very thing .
had me a young wife when i was 1 8 .
spent our first summer in the mountains .
made love every night .
and she' d lie there after ... ... bare breasted in the firelight .
and we' d talk sometimes till the sun come up .
that was my best time .
it' il be fine .
you' il do fine .
arlen bitterbuck , electricity shall now be passed through your body ... ... until you are dead , in accordance with state law .
god have mercy on your soul .
roll on two .
again .
adios , chief .
drop us a card from hell .
let us know if it' s hot enough .
he' s paid what he owed .
he' s square with the house again ... ... so keep your goddamn hands off him !
what' s up his ass ?
you .
always .
you , percy .
you gotta hate the new boy ?
that the way it is around here ?
why don' t you just move on ?
take that job at briar ridge ?
oh , yeah .
i know all about it .
sounds to me like a pretty good job .
i might just take it too , soon as you put me out front .
yeah , you heard me .
i want brutal' s spot for the next execution .
seeing a man die , that' s not enough .
you gotta smell his nuts cook .
i just wanna be out front , is all .
come on .
one time .
and then you know what ?
you' il be rid of me .
i swear .
and if i say no ?
well , i might just stick around for good .
make me a career of this ... ... boss .
you won' t believe this .
look .
i done tame me that mouse .
we see that .
watch this .
watch what he do .
ain' t he something now ?
he' s smart , mr. jingles .
mr. jingles ?
that his name .
he whispered in my ear .
hey , captain ... ... could i have a box for my mouse so he can sleep in here with me ?
your english gets better when you want something .
wanna see what else he can do ?
watch , watch .
mr. jingle ?
mr. jingle , wanna play fetch ?
wanna play fetch ?
play fetch .
watch , watch , watch .
he fetch it every time .
every time .
that' s some smart mouse , del .
like he a circus mouse or something .
correct .
that just what he is too .
he' s a circus mouse .
when i get out , he' il make me rich .
you just watch and see if he don' t do that .
we play fetch again ?
well , well , well .
looks like you found yourself a new friend .
don' t hurt him .
ls that the one i chased ?
yeah , that' s the one .
only del says his name is mr. jingles .
ls that so ?
del' s been asking for a box .
thinks the mouse will sleep in it .
might keep it for a pet .
what do you think ?
you know what ?
we ought to find a cigar box ... ... and get some cotton batting from the dispensary to line it with .
that should do real nice .
man said get a cigar box .
hal , you wanted to see me ?
close the door .
so you know ... ... you got a new prisoner coming in here tomorrow .
william wharton .
he' s what you call ... ... a problem child .
got " billy the kid " tattooed on his left arm .
been rambling all over the state last few years ... ... causing all kinds of trouble .
finally hit the big time .
killed three people in a holdup .
one of them a pregnant woman .
bad news all around .
it' s a tumor , paul .
a brain tumor .
they got ... ... x ray pictures of it .
it' s the size of a lemon , they said .
and ... ... way down ... ... deep inside , where they can' t operate .
i haven' t told her .
i can' t think how .
for the life of me , paul ... ... i can' t think how to tell my wife ...
... she' s going to die .
oh , oh , god .
oh , god .

you' ve been declared competent , son .
you know what that means ?
you' re gonna ride the lightning .
shut up , give us a hand .
hellraiser .
you don' t look so good .
look like you' re running you a fever .

you didn' t ask ?
i guess that' s not a mistake ... ... you' il be needing to make again anytime soon , is it ?
you go get dean and harry looked at .
make sure they' re all right .
percy , you make the report to the warden for me .
say the situation' s under control .
it' s not a story .
he won' t appreciate you drawing out the suspense .
what about you ?
you' re about to collapse .
i' ve got the mile till you all come back .
go on now .
go .
come on , boy .
let' s get you looked at .
boss , i needs to see you down here .
this is not a good time , john coffey ... ... not a good time at all .
but i needs to see you , boss .
i needs to talk to you .
closer .
you know you ain' t supposed to do that .
mind your business , del .
what do you want , john coffey ?
just to help it .
don' t be afraid .
help !

coffey' s killing boss edgecomb !
help !
what are you doing ?
boss howell !
help !
boss stanton !
somebody , come !

boss howell !
boss stanton !
somebody , come !
john coffey' s killing boss edgecomb !
del , for chrissakes , shut up !
what did you just do to me ?
i helped it .
didn' t i help it ?
i just took it back , is all .
awful tired now , boss .
dog tired .
boss , what that man do to you ?
hey , honey .
how you feeling ?
oh , not too bad .
what did the doctor say ?
you know doctors .
gobbledygook , mostly .
gobbledygook .
having stew tonight .
what are you doing ?
what does it feel like ?
well , i know what it feels like .
it feels great .
not that i' m complaining ... ... but we haven' t gone four times in one night since we were 1 9 .
yeah , we did , at your mom' s .
wanna tell me what' s going on ?
well ... ... see , the thing is ... ... i never actually made it in to dr. bishop' s yesterday .
brutal , paul .
listen .
i' m thinking of taking the morning off sick .
you cover the fort for me ?
that' s swell .
thanks .
yeah , i' m sure i' il feel better .
you' re sure you ought to do this ?
i' m not sure what i' m sure of .
burt , you got some company .
can i offer you a cold drink ?
yes , ma' am .
a cold drink would be fine .
thank you .
mr. hammersmith , your office said i might find you at home .
hope i' m not troubling you .
well , that depends , mr ... ?
paul edgecomb .
i' m e block supervisor up on cold mountain .
the green mile .
yeah , i' ve heard of it .
lost a few clients your way .
i' d like to ask you about one .
have a seat .
thank you .
which client ?
now you got my curiosity aroused .
john coffey .
coffey .
causing you problems ?
can' t say he is .
he doesn' t like the dark and cries on occasion ... ... but other than that ....
he cries , does he ?
got a lot to cry about , i' d say .
you know what he did .
i read the court transcript .
thank you , missus .
my pleasure .
kids !
lunch is about ready .
y' all come on up .
coming , mama !
what exactly are you trying to find out ?
i wonder if he did anything like that before .
why ?
has he said anything ?
no , but a man who does a thing like that ... ... has often developed a taste for it over time .
it occurred to me ... ... that it might be easy enough to follow his back trail .
find out .
a man his size , and colored to boot , can' t be that hard to trace .
you' d think so , but you' d be wrong .
believe me , we tried .
like he' d dropped out of the sky .
how can that be ?
we' re in a depression .
a third of the country' s out of work .
people are drifting by the thousands , looking for jobs , for greener grass .
even a giant like coffey wouldn' t get noticed everywhere .
not until he kills a couple of little girls .
he is ... ... strange , i admit .
but there doesn' t seem to be any real violence in him .
i know violent men , mr. hammersmith .
i deal with them day in and day out .
you didn' t come to ask me whether he killed before .
you came to see if i think he did it at all .
do you ?
one seldom sees a less ambiguous case .
he was found with the victims in his arms .
and yet you defended him .
everyone is entitled to a defense .
kids !
lunch !
y' all listen to your mama !
i' il tell you something .
you listen close too , because it might be something you need to know .
i' m listening .
we had us a dog .
just a sweet mongrel .
you know the kind .
well , in many ways , a good mongrel dog is like a negro .
you get to know it .
often , you get to love it .
it is of no particular use ... ... but you keep it around because you think it loves you .
lf you' re lucky , mr. edgecomb , you never have to find out any different .
my wife and i were not so lucky .
caleb , come here for a second .
come here .
please , son .
he still has the one good eye .
i suppose he' s lucky ... ... not to be completely blind .
we get down on our knees and thank god for that much at least .
right , caleb ?
go on in , now .
that dog attacked my boy for no reason .
just got it in his mind one day .
the same with john coffey .
he was sorry afterwards .
of that i have no doubt .
but those little girls ... ... stayed raped and murdered .
maybe he' d never done it before .
my dog never bit before .
but i didn' t concern myself with that .
i went out with my rifle , grabbed his collar and blew his brains out .
ls coffey guilty ?
yes , he is .
don' t you doubt it .
and don' t you turn your back on him .
you may get away with it once or even a hundred times ... ... but in the end ... ... you' il get bit .
oh , me !
oh , my !
i' m smelling me some corn bread .
it' s from my missus .
she wanted to thank you .
thank me for what ?
well , you know .
for helping me .
helping you with what ?
you know .
was your missus pleased ?
several times .
john , i can smell that from over here .
i surely can .
can i give del and mr. jingles some ?
well , it' s yours , john .
you can do with it as you please .
here .
this for del and mr. jingles .
hey !
what about me ?
i' m gonna get some too , ain' t l ?
it' s yours , john .
