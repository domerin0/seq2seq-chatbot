legend has it that it was written by the dark ones .
necronomicon ex mortis , roughly translated , " book of the dead " .
the book served as a passageway to the evil worlds beyond ..
it was written long ago .
when the seas ran red with blood .
it was this blood that was used to ink the book .
in the year 1300 ad , the book disappeared .

it was in the rear chamber of the castle that we stumbled upon something remarkable .
morturom demonto , the " book of the dead " .
my wife and i brought the book to this cabin where i could study it undisturbed .
it was here that i began the translations .
the book speaks of a spiritual presence . ,
a thing of evil that roams the forests and the dark bowers of man' s domain ..
it is through the recitation of the book' s passages ... that this dark spirit is given license to possess the living .
included here are the phonetic pronunciations of those passages .
cunda astratta montose eargrets gutt nos veratoos canda amantos canda " .
it' s gone .

and now i fear that my wife has become host to a candarian demon .
may god forgive me for what i have unleashed unto this earth .
last night henrietta tried to ... kill me .
it' s now october 1st , 4 : 33 pm .
henrietta is dead .
i could not bring myself to dismember her corpse .
but i dragged her down the steps ...
and i buried her .
i buried her in the cellar .
god help me ,
i buried her in the earthen floor of the fruit cellar .
what the hell was that ?
somebody' s down there with him .
no , can' t be .
let' s get the fuck out of here .
someone' s in my fruit cellar .
someone with a fresh soul !
let me out !
there' s something down here !
ah !
let him out !
it' s a trick , i know it !

hahaha .

i' il swallow your soul .

it lives ... out in those woods , in the dark ... something ... something that' s come back from the dead .
plee !
please let' s just get the hell out of here !
we' re going baby .
we' re going to get on that trail
nobody' s going out that door , not till daylight .
now you listen to me
remember that song annie ?
i used to sing it to you when you were a baby .
mother ?
unlock these chains .
quickly !
no .
you were born september 2nd , 1962 .
i remember it well because it was snowing . so strange it would be snowing in september .
that thing in the cellar is not my mother .
we are the things that were and shall be again .
steps of the book .
we want what is yours .
life !
dead by dawn .
dead by dawn .
dead by dawn .
dead by dawn .
dead by dawn .
dead by dawn .
let me out .
thirsty son of a bitch .
where you going ?
help us you filthy coward !
we live still !
that' s funny .
what ?
that trail we came in here on ?
it just ain' t there no more .
like , like the woods just swallowed her up .
it' s so quiet .
maybe something trying to force its way into our world .
hell no .
you' re the curious one .
hey .
i' il go with you .
shit .
i told you there weren' t nothing in here no how .
holy mother o ' mercy .
father ?
annie .
there is a dark spirit here that wants to destroy you .
your salvation lies there .
in the pages of the book .
recite the passages .
dispel the evil .
save my soul .
and your own lives !
jake .
you' re holding my hand too tight .
baby , i ain' t holding your hand .
hey ?
where' s bobby joe ?
hey ?
where the hell is she ?
we gotta go out there and find her .
if she went out in those woods , you can forget about her .
what' s wrong ?
felt like someone just walked over my grave .
what' s that picture ?
what is that ?
in 1300 ad they called this man the , ah , hero from the sky .
he was prophesied to have destroyed the evil .
didn' t do a very good job ...
can you find it ?
here it is , two passages .
recitation of this first passage ..
will make this dark spirit manifest itself in the flesh .
why the hell would we want to do that ?
recitation of this second passage creates
a kind of rift in time and space .
and the physical manifestation of this dark spirit can be forced back into the rift .
at least that' s the best translation that i can
that' s right .
i' m running the show now .
we' re going to go out there in them woods and look for bobby joe .
once we find her we' re getting the hell out of here .
no you idiot !
you' il kill us all .
she' s dead by now .
don' t you understand ?
with these pages , at least we have a chance .
bunch of mumbo jumbo bullshit .
these pages don' t mean squat .
besides , now you ain' t got no choice .
now move !
move .
look .
you' re nuts .
i said move !
i' il blow your fucken head off .
hey .
no trail .
where to now ?
you' il get us all killed !
shut up !
leave him alone !
get outta here ...
where are you , girl ?
you' re next .
annie !
i' m sorry !
get me another room .
get the axe .
we' il kill it when it comes back .
but first , pull this damn thing out of me !
i can' t breathe , i can' t breathe .
hurry !
i' m trying !
i' m trying !
shut up !
shut up !
shut up !
check outside the windows .
check the windows , he' s probably right out ...
ahhh !
help me !
oh god !
ahhhhh !
no !
no wait !
listen to me !
i' m alright now .
that thing is gone !
damn it !
i said i was alright !
are you listening to me ?
you hear what i' m saying ?
i' m alright !
i' m alright .
ok , maybe you are .
but for how long ?
if we' re going to beat this thing , we need those pages .
then let' s head down into that cellar and carve ourselves a witch .
groovy .
those pages are down there somewhere .
nos veratos alamemnon conda .
let' s go .
i' il swallow your soul .
i' il swallow your soul .
hey !
i' il swallow your soul !
i' il swallow your soul !
