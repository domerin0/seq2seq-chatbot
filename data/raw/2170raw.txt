what a lovely compliment coming from my perfectly lovely daughter .
7 : 15 .
where on earth is your father ?
sybil , did i leave my gloves on the hall table ?
yes , i see them .
it' s nearly 20 after and mr. whitaker still hasn' t phoned ?
i' m at my wits ' end .
oh , thank you , sybil .
i tried phoning the office even though i knew no one would be there .
i certainly hope that' s him , because if it isn' t ...
whitaker residence .
this is the hartford police department ... calling for a mrs. frank whitaker .
who is it ?
the police department .
hello ?
yes , am i speaking with a mrs. frank whitaker ?
yes .
one moment , please .
cathy ?
oh , frank .
are you all right ?
what happened ?
everything' s fine .
it was all just a big mix up ... the whole thing .
but you have to come get me .
they won' t let me leave on my own .
oh , frank , don' t worry , darling .
i' il be there as soon as i can .
is there anything i can do , mrs. whitaker ?
just keep an eye on the children , please .
i don' t think i' il be very long .
big time faggot .
family man .
never can tell .
say , get a load of this one .
you don' t see that every day of the week .
this is your copy , ma' am , and your receipt .
thank you .
oh , frank .
i tell you one thing ... if it hadn' t been for that sniveling junior cop , they would have never gone through this whole charade in the first place .
instead of trying to save face ...
i saw that guy that they were after , that loiterer .
but they wouldn' t listen to me .
so , there were drinks after work ?
what do you mean ?
they said something , intoxication level , something ...
christ , i had one lousy cocktail with bill after work going over the portfolio .
should i be arrested for that too ?
no , of course not , darling .
the whole thing has just put me in a foul state .
he' s fine .
oh , the car' s fine .
frank says it was the bumper that got hit .
but you know me , i can' t tell the difference .
oh , i' m just sorry we had to miss it .
she was fine .
said it was all a dreadful bore , what with mona lauder ... and her gossip .
cathy ,
i' m sorry .
darling , you' ve nothing to be sorry for .
it was all just a silly , wretched mistake .
ohh .
i' m so tired .
of course you are .
you sleep now .
the bus is here .
have a good day at school .
bye .
i thought you were going to have another piece of toast .
it' s late .
i should be getting down there .
can i at least fix you lunch ?
no , thank you , dear .
i' ve got lunch meetings all week .
it' s portfolio season .
sybil , if that' s the milkman , his check is in the drawer .
i' m just glad you' re feeling better , dear .
thank you , darling .
pardon me , ma' am , sir .
mrs. whitaker , this is mrs. leacock .
she said she had an appointment with you this morning .
oh , jiminy , i completely forgot the time .
please forgive me .
i do apologize , mrs. whitaker , but candid views are always the best .
good bye , darling .
good bye , dear .
mrs. leacock .
pleasure , mr. whitaker .
your husband' s a very charming man , mrs. whitaker .
thank you .
we' re rather fond of him ourselves .
now , please , won' t you come in ?
make yourselves at home .
i suppose i still can' t imagine ... why you would want an interview with someone like me in the first place .
readers of the " weekly gazette , mrs. whitaker ... women just like yourself ... with families and homes to keep up .
a good society paper ... need not be a gossip rag .
you are the proud wife ... of a successful sales executive ... planning the parties , and posing at her husband' s side on the advertisements .
to everyone here in connecticut , you are mr. and mrs. magnatech .
thank you .
i' m very flattered .
but , really , my life is like any other wife or mother' s .
in fact , i don' t think i' ve , i' ve ever wanted anything ...
what is it , dear ?
i think i just saw someone walking through our yard .
what on earth ...
oh , my ...
mrs. whitaker , perhaps you should call the police .
excuse me .
may i help you ?
who are you ?
i' m sorry , ma' am .
my name is raymond deagan ...
otis deagan' s son .
i was just taking over some of his ...
oh , you' re otis' s son .
yes .
i i' m terribly sorry for speaking to you in that manner .
i i didn' t know who was in my yard .
oh , no need .
how is your father ?
i know he was in the hospital .
yes , well , my father' s passed away , i' m afraid .
oh ...
oh , i i had no idea .
i' m , i' m so very sorry .
please , accept our deepest condolences .
your father was a wonderful , dedicated man .
thank you .
mrs. whitaker ?
the caterer' s on the line .
oh , thank you , sybil .
i beg your pardon .
would you excuse me for just a moment ?
of course .
mrs. leacock , i' m terribly sorry .

does doug know ?
yeah , i called him first thing .

i just wish you wouldn' t overwork yourself , especially after ...
i know .
i will .
see you then .
good bye , dear .
i' m terribly sorry about all the interruptions .
now , where was it you wanted me ?
just one more at the fireplace .
that' s it .
now smile .
isn' t that darling ?
hold it .
well , i guess that about wraps it up .
bob , rick .
gentlemen .
you' re sure you' re all right getting home , sir ?
thank you , davis .
but as 2nd in command of the " u. s. s. mcmillan ,
i do feel equipped to locate my own car without cover .
very good , sir .
bright and early .
sir , can you spare some change , please ?
spare change ?
anything would help .
spare change ?
where ya headed , tiger ?
look out , jake !
oh , for heaven' s sake .
david , that is the third time i' ve told you to turn off that infernal racket and go to bed .
can i pleasejust this once ?
no , you certainly may not , and that is final .
ah , geez .
that is not the kind of language we use in this house .
now march .
and don' t forget to wash your teeth .
hi .

mrs. white ?

thank you , sir .
have a pleasant evening .
yes , sir .
what can i get you this evening ?
uh , just a scotch ... neat , please .
yes , sir .
there you are , sir .
one more of the same .
so , does the fabled maxim hold that behind every great man there resides a great lady ?
in this case , wife , mother and mrs. magnatech herself ,
cathleen whitaker proves that it does .
a woman as devoted to her family ... as she is kind to negroes .
to negroes ?
let me see that .
what on earth is that woman thinking ?
cathy ?
oh , she' s been liberal ever since she played summer stock at college ... with all those steamyjewish boys .
why do you think they used to call her " red " ?
oh , for heaven sakes .
let' s go inside before joe mccarthy comes driving by .
uh oh .
oh , i love that scarf .
oh , i' m sure itjust blew behind the house somewhere .
for heaven sakes .
this really isn' t your day , is it ?
no .
did they really call you " red " ?
oh , nancy .
honestly !
would anyone like another daiquiri ?
better not .
oh , no , one' s my limit .
el ?
mmm .
all right , girls .
no more beating around the bush .
nancy .
oh , i ...
i can' t .
oh , come on .
it can' t be that bad .
um , well , uh ...
mike insists on ...
he insists on once a week .
ah , you got off easy .
once a week ?
oh , you' re lucky .
ron' s more like two or three .
three , really ?
and how .
that' s nothing .
girlfriend of mine ...
shirley dawson .
her husband ... every night of the week .
plus , three more times on the weekend .
can you imagine ?
it was lovely , cathleen .
thank you .
bye .
bye , girls .
the chicken was divine .
oh , thanks , el .
i' il call you tomorrow .
all right .
bye bye .
could this possibly ...
oh , i' m sorry .
no .
you found it .
yeah , i found it hanging off one of the birches out back .
it was so windy .
i was going back into the house and it just sailed off my neck .
i had a feeling it might be yours .
who else could have been so absentminded ?
no , no , it' s the color .
it just seemed right .
well , thank you , mr. deagan ... for finding it .
please , call me raymond .
thank you , raymond .
everything looks wonderful , by the way .
good .
i think we got everything pretty much under control .
well , it can' t have been easy ... taking over for your father so quickly .
well , between pop' s business , my , uh , shop ... and taking care of my little girl , doesn' t leave much time for reflecting .
i didn' t know you had children .
just the one ...
sarah' s her name .
and how old is sarah ?
eleven .
well , i' m sure she' s a lovely child .
you and your wife must be very proud .
well , um , mrs. deagan , my wife , uh , passed away when sarah was about five .
oh , raymond , i' m so sorry .
thank you .
sarah and i , we do just fine .
you know , i got a picture of her somewhere .
there she is .
that' s my sarah .
oh , she' s darling .
look at those eyes .
now , what' s this i hear about a shop ?
oh , yeah , the plant shop .
it' s just a little place down on hawthorn .
started out as a service for gardeners ... till i opened the store about six years ago , and , uh ...
well , it' s the only thing that business degree' s been good for yet .
why , that' s marvelous , raymond .
you should be very proud .
well , i am .
uh , if you' re ever in the neighborhood , be sure to stop by .
i certainly will .
all right , then .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
if that' s your father ...
don' t worry sybil , i' il get it .
hello ?
frank , you haven' t left yet ?
oh , no .
not again .
all right .
good bye , dear .
he isn' t coming home again ?
no , he' s going to be late .
father never wants to come home .
janice , he most certainly does .
he' s just very busy at work and under a great deal of strain .
yeah !
shut up .
janice , that' s enough .
sybil , you know what ?
wrap up mr. whitaker' s plate .
i' m going to run down to the office ... and take it to him myself .
all the way downtown ?
it' s not so very far .
anyway , the children are fine .
knowing mr. whitaker , i' m just saving him another night of pretzels and coffee .
thank you .
i' m just dropping something off for my husband on the 12th floor .
mr. whitaker .
thank you .
all right .
frank ?
oh , frank .
frank ?
cathy .
mr. maynard ...
left an estimate for the roof .
i put it in the kitchen .
twelve hundred something .
cathy ...
i can' t .
i don' t ...
what ?
eh , you see , uh ...
once , a long time ago , a long , long time ago ,
i had , um , um , problems ...
i just " f" igured that was ...
that was it .
i i never imagined ...
you had problems ?
y yes .
you , uh , never spoke to anyone ... a a doctor ?
no .
no one ?
i don' t understand .
neither do i.
what if ...
i mean , there must be people who ... [ panting ]
i i don' t know .
because ...
otherwise , i don' t know what i ... cathy .
all right .
thank you .
mr. and mrs. whitaker , this is dr. bowman .
mr. whitaker , how do you do ?
hello .
mrs. whitaker , how lovely .
thank you .
i suppose we may as well get started .
actually , uh , mrs. whitaker , i think it might be best ... if your husband and i conversed in private .
in private .
yes , of course .
i think it would be best .
certainly , doctor .
i' il see you later .
i' il see you later , dear .
today , the general attitude regarding this sort of behavior ... is naturally more modern , more scientific than it ever has been before .
but for those who do seek treatment , who possess the will and desire ... to lead a normal life , there still remains only a scant ... five to thirty percent rate of success ... for complete heterosexual conversion .
for many , it' s the treatment itself ... that often changes the patient' s mind .
what does it , uh , comprise of ?
the treatment .
the treatment' s comprised of psychiatric sessions ... twice a week , sometimes more .
just talking ?
yes .
though some patients have explored additional , more behavioral methods .
behavioral ?
electroshock aversion therapy for instance .
or hormonal rebalancing procedures .
i know this can all seem rather daunting at first .
i suggest you take some time .
think over the various options we' ve discussed .
discuss it with your wife .
no , i already know .
i want to begin treatment .
i can' t let this thing ... destroy my life , my family' s life .
i , uh ...
i i know it' s a sickness , because it makes me feel ... despicable .
i promise you , dr. bowman , i' m going to beat this thing .
i' m gonna break it .
so help me god .
why don' t you confirm those times we discussed with rosalyn .
i' il see you here same time next tuesday .
thank you , doctor .
mr. whitaker , mrs. whitaker .
thank you , doctor .
frank ?
what ?
i' m just proud of you , that' s all .
don' t say that .
well , i am .
he seems a very decent man , dr. bowman .
don' t you think ?
frank ?
i don' t know , cathleen .
i suppose he' s decent .
but you must have liked him enough to want to see him again .
who else am i going to see ?
well , i' m sure there are numerous doctors in hartford or springfield if you ...
look , i just want to get the whole fucking thing over with !
can you understand that ?
frank , please don' t .
i i' m sorry .
all right , cathy , i' m so sorry .
good morning , mr. whitaker .
morning .
morning .
good morning , mr. whitaker .
hi , kitty .
i hope you have a pleasant day , sir .
thank you .
good morning , mr. whitaker .
marlene .
i found this in the cupboard , sir .
what' s that ?
your office lamp ... the one that was missing .
ah ...
should i have it repaired , sir ?
yes .
yes , thank you , marlene .
mr. whitaker , mr. fine' s been waiting .
frank ?
uh ?
i didn' t see you sitting there .
everything all right ?
oh , with me ?
of course .
what' s up ?
just picked up the galleys from the printer .
how do they look ?
great , just great .
just leave them there .
i' il take a look first chance i get .
sure .
you' il let me know what you think ?
of course i will .
you' re first on my list .
what' s it gonna take to get you back on that course anyway ?
we haven' t seen you for weeks .
i know .
sunday .
no excuses .
all right .
i' il hold you to it .
thanks again , el .
you sure that' s all i can give you ?
oh , yes .
the caterer should have everything .
i just thought a few extras would be nice .
oh , don' t forget .
the art show is saturday .
start working on frank tonight .
i swear he' s the kind of man you have to pin messages to .
though i' m sorry to say , mona lauder " will " be attending .
turns out her uncle' s in town , some hotshot art dealer from new york .
i think i met him at one of mona' s soirees .
a bit flowery for my taste .
how do you mean ?
oh , you know , a touch light on his feet .
oh , you mean ...
yes , darling , he' s one of those .
of course , i could be mistaken .
just an impression i got .
you don' t care for them particularly ?
well , no , not particularly .
not that i actually know any .
call me old fashioned , i just like all the men i' m around to be all men .
say , why the third degree ?
it' s not the third degree .
i' m just interested , that' s all , in your views .
i read an article in a magazine .
what ?
nothing .
i' m just delighted to see you taking interest in yet another civic cause .
i can see it now .
cathleen whitaker and her kindness to homosexuals .
ugh .
that word .
see you saturday ... and bring frank .
i' il try .
then billy hutchinson stole a pass at the ten yard line .
ran it all the way for a touchdown .
you shoulda seen it , pop .
father , want to see my routine for the ballet recital ?
hey , i was talking to pop .
children , give your father a moment to eat his dinner .
would you like another lamb chop , dear ?
oh , i' m fine .
are you sure ?
i have plenty in the oven .
no , thank you .
i' m , i' m fine .
we' re playing lincoln on saturday , pop ... if you' re not working .
that reminds me .
this saturday is the reception for the modern art show i told you about , the one that eleanor' s group is sponsoring .
oh , god .
i know how you hate these things , but i simply have to go .
eleanor pleaded with me to ask you .
wait , what about me ?
no one cares one bit what i' m doing saturday .
david , i' m sorry .
but this saturday your mother has an engagement that simply cannot be changed .
well , pop could come .
couldn' t you , pop ?
we' il see , david .
janice , could you please pass the butter ?
thank you .
president eisenhower was determined to keep the troops there until ... ... satisfactory or unequivocal assurances that ... frank ?
hmm ?
did you see him ?
yeah .
you didn' t say a word .
so how did it go with bowman ?
did you feel ...
it was fine .
and there' s nothing else you care to share with your very own adoring wife ?
cathleen , what i discuss with this doctor ... it' s private , all right .
that' s part of it .
oh , i understand , darling .
i do .
oh ... [ chuckling ]
frank , wait till you see the hors d' oeuvres .
the caterer' s doing , just such a marvelous job .
i think you' re going to be so pleased this year , darling .
i really do .
eleanor , darling , i' m so sorry i' m late .
cathleen , darling .
hello , mona .
uh , i want to introduce you to my uncle , morris farnsworth , that wickedly successful gotham art dealer ... who was kind enough to attend our provincial little gathering .
morris , darling , allow me to introduce you ... to my dear little friend , cathleen whitaker , whose face and civic fancies are hardly strangers ... to the society pages of hartford .
oh , mona .
really , you must ignore her , mr. farnsworth .
charmed .
i do hope you enjoy your stay .
morris was just telling us the most delightful tale ... all about a forged rembrandt .
cathy , don' t let us keep you .
i know you want to see the show .
i am dying to see it .
oh , yes , dear , simply charming .
eleanor , you should be so proud .
thank you , mona .
it was lovely to meet you , mr. farnsworth .
likewise , my dear .
wife of hartford executive ... communing with picasso ?
mrs. leacock , it' s lovely to see you again .
and how is that charming husband of yours ?
oh , he' s very well .
thank you .
um , would you excuse me just a moment ?
oh , certainly , dear .
thank you .
raymond , what a tremendous surprise finding you here .
mrs. whitaker , hello .
is this your daughter ?
yep , this is my sarah .
hello , sarah .
hello .
bobby , get over here !
say , sarah , isn' t that hutch and his little brother i see playing out front ?
you remember them , don' t you , baby ?
oh , sure you do .
the day we went to the hutchinson house .
oh , yeah .
what do you say you go out and see if they' d like to play for a while ?
ah , go on .
for daddy ?
attagirl .
oh , raymond , she' s lovely .
thank you .
well , how on earth did you find out about this show ?
well , i do read the papers .
w ...
no , of course you do .
i just meant that it' s ... it' s such a ... it' s a coincidence .
i know .
i was just teasing you .
because , you know , i' m not prejudiced .
my husband and i have always believed in equal rights for the negro ... and support the n. a. a. c. p.
i' m glad to hear that .
i just wanted you to know .
well , thank you .
oh , not at all .
go !
straighter , tommy !
you got to throw it straighter .
and hard .
one , two , three , go !
it' s too heavy .
what ?
on the back .
your airplane .
who asked you ?
come on , bobby .
so , what' s your opinion on modern art ?
uh , it' s hard to put into words really .
i i just know what i care for , and , and what i don' t .
like this ...
i don' t know how to pronounce it .
mira " ?
mir .
mir .
i don' t know why , but i just adore it .
a feeling it gives .
i know that sounds terribly vague .
no , no , actually it confirms something i' ve always wondered about modern art , abstract art .
what is that ?
that perhaps it' s just picking up where religious art left off , somehow trying to show you divinity .
the modern artistjust pares it down to the basic elements of shape and color .
but when you look at that mir , you feel it just the same .
why , that' s lovely , raymond .
to tell the truth , i' ve always preferred the work of the masters .
rembrandt , michelangelo ...
would you excuse me a moment ?
oh , certainly .
cathleen ...
oh , el , honey , everything looks just marvelous .
cathy , who on earth is that man ?
you have this whole place in a clamor .
for heaven sakes why ?
because of that ridiculous story ?
who is he ?
he' s raymond deagan , otis deagan' s son .
your gardener ?
he passed away and raymond' s taken over his business .
you certainly seem on familiar terms with him .
oh , " familiar terms " ...
what does that mean ?
he happens to have some very interesting views on mir .
oh , jeepers , look at the time .
i have to fly .
i' m having the carpets cleaned for tomorrow ...
what time are the caterers showing ?
they said 4 : 00 .
i' il come early , for moral support .
you' re a doll .
so glad you could make it .
come in .
come in .
not to say that i' m against integration , mind you .
i do believe it' s the christian thing to do .
but i still say what happened in little rock ... could just as easily have happened here in hartford .
nonsense .
well , why is that ?
well , for one thing , there' s no governor faubus in connecticut .
but the main reason , there are no negroes .
no , but there are some ... rather dangerous pro integration types right here in hartford .
dangerous ?
oh , yes .
some very attractive ones , in fact , noted , i' m told , for their kindness to negroes .
oh , dick , stop .
where on earth did you hear about that ?
shirley read it to me .
i should have known .
what' s all this ?
absolutely nothing .
now , let me freshen those .
excuse me , please .
thanks .
oh , by golly , there she is now , the " purtiest " gal in the room .
oh , stan , liquor brings out the texan in you .
i hope eleanor isn' t listening .
so what if she is .
i still say frank is the luckiest guy in town .
hear !
hear !
it' s all smoke and mirrors , fellas .
that' s all it is .
you should see her without her face on .
frank !
no , he' s absolutely right .
we ladies are never what we appear , and every girl as her secrets .
i' il say .
how about this girl getting her husband another drink ?
darling , don' t you think you' ve already had enough ?
no , i don' t think i' ve had enough ...
i' d just like to take a moment to raise a glass to our marvelous host and hostess ... and another glorious annual party at the whitakers .
to frank and cathy , truly mr. and mrs. magnatech .
hear !
hear !
my goodness .
thank you very much .
now , who can i freshen up ?
ron ?
no , i' m fine .
me .
oh , i think you' re fresh enough .
all right .
here , mrs. whitaker , let me take that for you .
thank you , sybil .
cathy ?
hi .
honey , is everything all right ?
why ?
what do you mean ?
frank ...
i' ve never seen him so soused .
oh , he' s been working so hard lately .
he' s under tremendous strain .
you sure that' s all ?
oh , yes .
you' d tell me if there was anything more ?
of course i would .
well , cathy ,
i think we just threw ourselves one class " a " swanky function .
it did turn out nicely , didn' t it ?
cathleen , darling , you' ve simply outdone yourself once again .
thank you so much .
frank ?
well , if i do say so myself , it was a lovely party , all considering .
i just wish ... it didn' t have to turn ugly ... in front of our friends .
honestly , frank , if you didn' t insist on ...
what is it ?
oh , frank .
oh , jesus .
oh , jesus !
what' s happening ?
i can' t even ...
god !
frank , it doesn' t matter .
the important thing is to keep , to keep trying .
don' t !
what ?
because ...
i' m sure , you know ,
dick dawson wouldn' t mind lending his services every once in a while .
oh , frank .
i mean , you wouldn' t mind that so much , would you ?
a good looking guy like dick .
maybe even stan would pitch in .
frank , you' re the only man that i' ve ever wanted .
just let go .
frank , frank , you' re ...
you' re all men to me .
you' re all man .
stop it !
cathy .
cathy , i' m sorry .
oh .
i' m so sorry .
i didn' t mean to .
it' s all right .
i' m i' m all right .
it was an accident .
are you bleeding ?
oh , just ... just the littlest bit .
perhaps , um , you could get me some ice , dear .
some ice ?
yes .
cathy ...
i i know .
uh , um , it' s all right .
i' m all right .
hey , there , hon .
listen .

cathy .

cathy .

what do you mean ?
cathy , i' m your best friend .
nothing happened .
nothing at all .
oh , cathy .
eleanor .
cathy , i' m your dearest and closest friend in the world .

i it' s a difficult time [ sniffs ] with my husband .
oh .
it happens with married people .
i know it does .
i' m just ... it' s just embarrassing .
please forgive me .
forgive you ?
mrs. whitaker , listen .
i have to pick up some shrubs from a farmhousejust out of town .
which means i gotta get a move on .
why don' t you come along for the ride ?
some fresh air , change of scenery ... might help you take your mind of things .
ooh .
oh , no .
i , uh ... [ sniffles ]
i couldn' t .
uh ...
thank you , raymond , for offering .
you' re very kind .
you sure ?
mrs. whitaker ?
oh .
yes , sybil ?
it' s mrs. barker on the phone .
i' il be right there !
oh .
mm .
i have to get back .
okay .
oh , not at all .
um , well , i ...
i was planning on picking them up at 5 : 00 .
you' d like to switch for thursday ?
i don' t see why that would be a problem .
um , no .
i' m glad i could be of help .
certainly .
bye now .
raymond .
mrs. whitaker .
hi .
hello .
oh , wouldn' t you know it .
i just received a call and suddenly everything' s changed .
anyway , i ...
you changed your mind .
well , good .
thank you very much , mr. deagan .
thank you .
oh , it' s lovely .
what is it ?
hamamelis ... well , flowering witch hazel .
fairly rare in these parts .
it' s beautiful .
you were right .
what a perfectly lovely spot .
is that a path ?
i think so .
let' s have a peek .
all right .
sometimes it' s the people outside our world ... we confiide in best .
but once you do ... confide , share with someone , they' re no longer really outside , are they ?
oh .
look !
how lovely .
did he cause that ?
he didn' t mean to strike me .
i am so sorry .
no .
heaven knows we all have our troubles .
i' m sure you , yourself ...
what ?
i don' t know .
ever since running into you at the exhibition ,
i kept wondering what it must be like ... to be the only one in a room .
colored or ... whatever it was .
how that might possibly feel .
i' m sure i' ve ...
i' ve never ...
well ,
i suppose you sort of grow accustomed to it over time .
i mean , don' t get me wrong .
there is a world , even here in hartford , where everybody does indeed look like me .
trouble is , very few people ever leave that world .
i only want what every father wants for his child .
the opportunities growing up i never had .
naturally .
but i tell you something .
if you' re really interested ...
oh , i am .
you hungry ?
i mean , could you eat something ?
i suppose i could .
tell you what ,
i' m gonna take you to one of my favorite spots .
on good days , it' s got hot food , cold drink , and just about discernable music .
it' s hard to beat that .
there you go .
say , who' s green edsel ?
yoo hoo .
yoo hoo .
here i am .
oh .
there you are , ma' am .
let me get that for you .
oh .
thank you very much indeed .
thank you , ma' am .
oh , my god .
let me help you with that , ma' am .
oh .
thanks very much .

raymond .

oh , now you just sore because i haven' t been coming around like i used to .

i think i' il be fine .
all right then .
## " # " ## " # " [ slowjazz ]
thank you , raymond , for a lovely afternoon .
no .
thank you , mrs. whitaker .
i' ve had one as well .
mrs. whitaker sounds so formal .
would you ...
would i what ?
ask me to dance ?
## " # " ## " # " [ slowjazz continues ]
oh .
that looks wonderful .
now , let' s see .
where should we put it ?
oh .
i know .
right there .
right by the window .
yes .
yes .
that' s lovely .
it certainly is .
oh .
now , let' s see .
where did i put that list ?
although i promised janice that i wouldn' t be late for her recital .
can' t miss that .
sybil , i' ve been meaning to ask you ...
yes , ma' am ?
what' s the name of that church group you belong to ?
the one you mentioned to me .
you mean , at ebenezer ?
the baptist group ?
yes .
i believe that' s it .
or was it south green baptist during the fair drive , the ladies auxiliary ?
oh .
i didn' t know there was more than one .
yes .
i always seem to be signing up for something .
i think that' s marvelous , sybil , that you find the time with all you do for us .
i just have so much in the attic i' ve been meaning to go through .
i thought you might know of a church or civic organization ... that could use a donation .
well , certainly , mrs. whitaker , if that' s what you' re looking for .
places in need are never hard to find .
i' m sure you' re right .
oh !
my .
hello .
may i help you ?
good afternoon , ma' am .
allow me to introduce myself .
my name' s reginald carter and this is martha livingston .
we' re members of the hartford branch ... of the national association for the advancement of colored people .
oh , well , certainly , i am familiar with your organization .
perhaps you' d be interested in reading over our complimentary brochure .
mm .
yes .
i would .
if you wouldn' t mind signing our roster ... [ phone rings ]
i' m running so terribly late as it is .
sybil , would you mind signing for me ?
yes , ma' am .
thank you .
## " # " ## " # " [ ballet ]
mother !
hello , dear .
did the recital just begin ?
shh !
so where are the other little girls from your class ?
over there .
janice .
janice !
sybil ?
hello .
cathy ?
el ?
oh , cathy .
thank heavens you' re home .
i' ve been trying you all day .
el , what is it ?
so you haven' t heard ?
you haven' t heard a thing ?
no .
what happened ?
oh , cathy .
there' s been talk .
vicious talk .
what do you mean ?
about what ?
about you ?
oh , for heaven sake .
what now ?
honey .
it' s mona , cathy .
she' s ...
well , she' s just been on some kind of rampage , swearing up and down that she saw you and a colored man somewhere out on franklin .
getting out of a truck or some such thing .
the same colored man she claims you were talking to at the art show .
eleanor , that' s ... that' s preposterous .
i mean , yes , i' ve spoken to mr. deagan on occasion , but this makes it sound like ...
i know .
you have no idea what it' s been like around here .
the phone has been ringing off the hook since 8 : 00 this morning .
eleanor , the entire situation is so absurd .
darling , i know .
what in the world am i supposed to do ?
i suppose you could start by getting yourself another gardener .
frank ?
what on earth ...
eleanor , could i call you back ?
frank just walked in .
of course .
you go ahead .
i' il call you later .
frank ?
what are you doing home ?
is everything all right ?
just tell me one goddamned thing .
what ?
is it true , what they' ve been saying ?
frank , i can' t believe you even ...
because if it is , even in the slightest , i swear to god , cathleen ...
frank , i am sorry you even had to hear such nonsense .
yeah , well , dick dawson didn' t seem to think it was such nonsense ... when he snuck away from his desk to phone me today .
good heavens .
he says the whole friggin ' town' s talking !
frank , please .
sybil will hear you .
i sent her out !
christ , cathleen , do you even have the slightest idea about what this could mean ?
don' t you realize the effect it' s gonna have on me ... and the reputation i have spent the past eight years trying to build ... for you and the children and for the company ?
frank , i swear to you , whatever mona lauder saw or thought she saw ... was entirely a figment of that woman' s hateful imagination .
yes .
i have spoken to raymond deagan on occasion .
he brought his little girl to eleanor' s art show .
but ...
but , apparently , even here in hartford , the idea of a white woman even speaking to a colored man ...
oh , please !
just save me the negro rights !
you know what that woman is capable of !
and besides , i i' ve already given him notice ... and we ... we won' t be seeing that man again .
fine .
is that why you came home ... because of what dick said ?
did something happen at work ?
frank .
tsk .
i guess you could call it some sort of early christmas bonus .
what do you mean ?
a month of rest and relaxation .
can you imagine ?
during the busiest season of the year .
what a goddamn honor .
but when you consider the bang up job i' ve been doing ... ever since good ol ' dr. bowman came on the scene ... and for being ...
what did millstein call it ?
years overdue .
they do owe you a vacation after all you' ve given them .
palm springs is supposed to be nice .
so says the word on high .
i know it may not seem like it now , but a little time away , a vacation , might be the best thing ... for both of us .
frank , what a wretched day it must have been for you .
say , what do you know ?
pop' s home .
what you doin ' home , pop ?
david , your father has work to do .
it' s best you help yourself to a glass of milk and get started on your studies .
yes , mother .
say , pop ...
mind your mother , david .
yes , sir .
uh , say , mr. deagan ...
yes , jake ?
there' s a lady on the phone for you .
i' il be right there .
hello .
hello .
thank you for meeting me .
i realize you have a busy schedule .
worked out fine .
i was glad you called .
are you sure everything' s all right ?
uh , is there something i can do for you folks ?
can we leave here ?
of course .
what is it ?
what happened ?
i wanted to see you in person , raymond .
i ...
i just ...
i can' t .
can' t what ?
it isn' t plausible for me to be friends with you .
you' ve been so very kind to me and i' ve been perfectly reckless and foolish in return , thinking ...
thinking what ?
that one person could reach out to another , take an interest in another ... and maybe for one fleeting instant ... could manage to see beyond the surface , beyond the color of things ?
do you think we ever really do ... see beyond those things ... the surface of things ?
just beyond the fall of grace , behold that ever shining place .
yes .
i do .
i don' t really have a choice .
i wish i could .
good luck to you , raymond .
mrs. whitaker .
you !
boy !
hands off !
yeah !
you !
raymond , please don' t .
you' re so beautiful .
come on , dear .
oh !
it is them !
it is !

acapulco .

take your pick .
it' s your choice .
mother , will you help me lace up my slippers ?
in a minute , dear .
i don' t know .
stan is always raving about miami .
oh , frank .
miami would be a dream .

i' ve had quite enough fashion advice for the afternoon .
i do believe it' s time for my miss mitchell .
oh , heavens .

i think i left it upstairs .
so silly .
you want me to go get it ?
no .
you just sat down .

did you have a nice time , mr. whitaker ?
yes .
it was very relaxing .
say , pop ...
david , help sybil with the luggage please .
pop , you' il never guess what happened at school this week .
try and guess .
david .
uh , i give up .
i' m helping , mother .
billy hutchinson and these two other boys ... all got expelled from school .
i think you mean " suspended .
no .
expelled . " i swear .
for throwing a rock at a girl' s head .
that' s terrible .
a little girl at school ?
no .
she was a negro .
what ?
who told you such a thing ?
tommy hawkins .
he saw it , so he had to tell the principal .
sybil , is this true ?
yes , ma' am .
i' m afraid it is .
what on earth has gotten into this town ?
it was just a couple of foolish kids .
yeah .
hutch said that they were just trying to teach her a lesson .
well , i think it' s dreadful , and you' re not to play with that hutch boy again , understand me ?
yes , ma' am .
david , while you' re up , how about flippin' on the set for your old man ?
sure , pop .
mother , how do you spell " skirt " ?
uh , just a minute , dear .
mother' s making a call .
oh .
yes .
hello .
um , i was wondering if you could help me possibly .
i just received your brochure , which i found extremely informative , and i was curious about what was entailed , precisely , in your ... in your volunteer program in terms of particular skills and so on .
you see , i ...
oh .
oh , yes .
i can hold .
father' s home .
frank .
what happened to the match ?
oh , my , um , shoulder .
it started acting up .
i ...
i just couldn' t sit there any longer .
you didn' t say anything .
father , i did the splits today .
wanna see ?
janice , your father just walked in the door ... and you have schoolwork to finish .
yes , mother .
you know , frank , you never had that physical .
and i think you' re due for one .
can i call dr. ellis ?
you know , it' s been three years .
oh .
did i tell you that the pediatrician thinks that janice is going to need braces ?
father , do i have to ?
apparently , our little girl has an overbite .
pop , you' il never guess what i' m doing .
where is your coat ?
it' s in the garage .
i' m waxing pop' s car .
and what' s it doing there ?
it' s gonna look swell , pop .
how many times do i have to tell you children you are not permitted outdoors ... in this kind of weather unless you are properly dressed ?
yes , ma' am .
because i give up .
if you wanna go and catch your death of cold , then so be it .
you try talking some sense into them , frank , because whatever i say doesn' t ...
frank ?
what' s the matter ?
god .
david , janice , go upstairs to your rooms .
now .
now !
frank .
what is it ?
cathy , [ sobs ]
something' s happened .
what ?
i' ve fallen in love with someone ...
who wants to be with me .
oh , cathy ,
i i i just ...
i ...
i never knew what that felt ...
but i know that sounds so cruel , but ... oh , god .
cathy , i tried .
i tried so hard to make it go away .
it ...
it ...
i thought that i could do it ... for you and for the kids .
but ...
i can' t .
i just ...
i can' t .
i can' t .
i , um , assume then , you' il be ...
wanting a divorce .
cathy .
eleanor .
eleanor , it' s me , cathy .
oh , cathy .
so you see , el , why i couldn' t tell you anything ... anything at all .
oh , you dear sweet kid .
in a million years , i couldn' t have imagined .
not frank .
i think that' s what' s been hardest of all .
the endless secrecy .
our entire lives just shut in the dark .
are there savings ?
none to speak of .
certainly not with frank' s job on the line .
well , honey , if there' s anything you need , anything at all ...
oh , el .
i mean it .
we' re here , all right ?
thank you , el , for always having been .
you know , it' s funny .
what' s that ?
this whole time , the only person i was able to talk to about any of this ... was raymond deagan .
what ?
it' s true .
not in the way that mona intended .
nothing like that .
but we would just talk .
and somehow , it made me feel ...
i don' t know .
alive somewhere .
eleanor , i know it' s ridiculous and mad , but i ...
i think of him .
i do .
what he' s doing .
what he' s thinking .
i ...
i do .
el ?
what can i say ?
you' re so full of surprises , i' m speechless .
what do you mean ?
i' m sure i must' ve looked entirely the fool ... crusading away against mona lauder and all her so called inventions .
eleanor , how could you say such a thing ?
i didn' t say a word .
who am i to tell anyone how to lead their lives ?
eleanor , nothing happened between us .
i told you that .
cathy , it' s none of my business , but you certainly make it sound as if something had .
mrs. whitaker ?
oh .
sybil .
i' m sorry to disturb you , ma' am .
i i just ...
yes , sybil ?
there' s something i' ve been wanting to tell you , ma' am , for some time .
something i believe you surely wanna know , even if it isn' t exactly my place .
well , what is it ?
it' s about the little colored girl , ma' am .
the one that got hit .
yes .
what about her ?
i' m sorry , ma' am .
it was mr. deagan' s little girl , sarah .
what ?
oh , sybil .
no .
the neighbors tell me she' s doing just fine .
oh , that poor sweet little girl .
that ...
how in god' s name could you not have told me , sybil ?
this was weeks ago !
mrs. whitaker , please don' t be cross with me .
i didn' t wanna make things any worse .
sybil , do you know where mr. deagan lives ?
i believe he' s been at his father' s old place on 12th and governor .
twelfth and governor .
thank you .
are you going there now ?
please keep an eye on the children .
i shouldn' t be too long .
mrs. whitaker .
what ?
would you like me to go with you , ma' am ?
no .
no , i' il be fine .
thank you , sybil .
who on earth ?
yes .
raymond , i ...
i just heard .
just this instant .
i heard and i jumped into my car .
how are you ?
how is sarah ?
we' re fine .
thank you .
would you meet me around the side ?
sarah , everything' s all right .
daddy' s just gonna be out for a minute , okay ?
okay .
raymond .
what she must' ve been through .
what' s being done to the boys ?
nothing .
i won' t put her through that again .
not now .
not with rocks coming through the windows every night .
raymond , that' s hateful .
oh , it' s not whites throwin ' them .
it' s coloreds .
no .
yeah .
seems to be the one place where whites and coloreds are in full harmony .
anyway , we' il be outta here soon enough once and for all .
you' re moving ?
yeah .
where to ?
i have a brother in baltimore , says he can find me work there .
so we' re packing up the house .
two weeks , friday , we' il be on the 4 : 30 train heading south .
what about your ... your business , your shop ?
oh , the business is through .
nobody' s gonna hire me .
so i' m gonna sell the shop to a cousin of mine .
yeah .
things are ... pretty well finished for me here .
i' ve never lived anywhere other than hartford .
perhaps ... sometime in the future ... after you' re settled , i could ...
perhaps i could come for a visit , see baltimore .
you see , i ...
well , it seems as if i' m to be single again .
oh , mrs. whitaker .
please call me cathy .
cathy .
no one would know us there .
i' m just not sure that would be a wise idea .
after , well , everything that' s ...
what matters now , what has to matter the most , is what' s right for sarah .
i' ve learned my lesson about mixing in other worlds .
i' ve seen the sparks fly .
all kinds .
have a proud life .
a splendid life .
will you do that ?
good bye , cathy .
hello .
cathy , did i wake you ?
i i' m sorry to call this late .
i hope i didn' t , uh ...
uh , no .
i was awake .
i , uh , didn' t want to upset the children .
no .
no , of course not .
how are they , by the way ?
fine .
just fine .
they still ask when you' il be coming home .
i know .
that' s , uh , partly why i' m calling really .
i got a call from dick yesterday ... and he said that everything was set , um , papers drawn up .
and he wanted to know how thursday was for you .
3 : 00 or sometime ?
i ...
i told him i thought you had car pool thursdays , but i wasn' t absolutely certain , so i said i would check .
you never could remember my car pool days .
and they' ve always been the same .
wednesdays and fridays , long as i can remember .
oh , wednesdays and fridays .
right .
uh ...
same old absentminded ...
what time ... did you say on thursday ?
what ?
the appointment .
what time ?
three .
uh , three o' clock .
all right .
okay .
uh , well ... great .
that ...
that was it , uh , really .
i ... [ clears throat ]

so i' il see you on ... on thursday then .
see you thursday .
good bye , cathy .
good bye , frank .
sixty seven dollars and thirty two cents .
