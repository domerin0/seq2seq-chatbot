i know she never understood my reasons for parting
but she knows when sons grow up they become birds and want to fly
i' d really like to have stayed but my fate decided otherwise
my mother watched in the doorway blessing me and crying as i left
that day my mother told me of the ways of the world
as if she knew each step along the way
without ever leaving my father' s side in that small town
she told me son , may god be with you
for this whole world is yours
i know she never understood my reasons for parting
but she knew when sons grow up they become birds and want to fly
i' d really like to have stayed but my fate decided otherwise

it' s the story of my life .
in these plain verses
my beauty , my love
for you i wish to sing
my suffering and pain
i' m like the whippoorwill
that sings so sadly
from the branch where it sits
with this guitar i truly sing and cry out
each lament is my yearning
i was born in those hills
in a lowly little shack
all full of holes
letting the moonlight shine in
when nightfall comes
hey , come here , kids !
i' il buy you lunch .
not even a letter .
that' s just how it is , helena .
it takes a while .
i thought miranda said one week ?
in these plain verses my beauty , my love
for i wish to sing my suffering and pain
i' m like the whippoorwill
that sings so sadly from the branch where it sits
with this guitar i truly sing and cry out
each lament is my yearning
i was born in those hills
in a lowly little shack
all full of holes
letting the moonlight shine in
beautiful !
perfect !
when nightfall comes go get dressed for the show .
the birds in the bush start making noise
downstairs in an hour , you hear emival ?
look , emival .

you' re not my father !
it' s been four months , francisco !

i want my two boys !
dad !
