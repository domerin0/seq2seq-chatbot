i remember these five warriors who set out on a journey ... ... to save us all from becoming innocent victims .
they never lost the will to fight for good against evil .
they did everything to fight ... ... souls from the grave who had come back to life .
before we go , you need to know what we are fighting .
when a corpse wasn' t at peace , after a while ... ... negative energy would build up ... ... causing physical changes which would allow it to move again .
these zombies feed on living flesh destroying life to live ... ... and eventually turning into vampires .
all powerful , supernatural beings .
wind yes
thunder rain yes
lightning yes
the four of you look after the rest .
this mission is dangerous , stay alert understand ?
yes
listen up
if you are bitten by a zombie , you can recover ... ... but once a zombie turns into a vampire ... ... if it attacks you , you too will become a vampire .
master , soon it will be daybreak .
the men haven' t slept for days , they' re exhausted .
they need to rest , to recuperate .
i feel a negative energy .
we must be extra careful .
master
how close are we now ?
according to the map , we have arrived .
this is a fortunated location .
there must be graves around here .
but i also sense danger .
the buried spirits are very restless .
something horrible could happen at any moment .
master , we found it
where ?
towards the southeast
this is the grave of a general , but it' s been tampered with .
lf the corpse is still inside , that means it hasn' t changed yet .
we must blow up the tomb .
if the corpse has gone , it may be a vampire by now .
master , i' il warn the men .
good .
gas
get back there' s methane gas everywhere
put out the torches
rain i' m here , master
catch the explosives
master catch
there' s a vampire
get him away from me
stay here then ....
it' s a wedding party .
we can' t tell them there is a vampire .
is the compass working ?
it' s stopped moving now .
maybe it needs a rest .
master told us to stay alert at all times .
anything could happen at anytime .
he also said that where we find vampires , we will find him .
we might bump into him .
i hope so .
smile , guys .
mr. kow , these are the workers you requested .
are you dumb , or what ?
i need more than two helpers .
can these four men work in the kitchen ?
yes yes
stop looking at the compass .
what are your names ?

lightning .
wind , thunder , rain and lightning ?
what kind of stupid names are those ?
from now on , you are kung , hei , fat , choi .
now repeat that .
i' m kung .

this compass isn' t responding .
maybe we' re in the wrong place .

stop talking nonsense .
it' s possible .
hurry out and greet your bride
the wedding ceremony will begin now .

i like this .
i like this .
say , did you see the bride ?
it' s none of our business .
just asking .
seems like there' s no vampires here .
let' s just get our money and leave .
the jiangs are in the wax business ... ... and they' re very unlucky with women .
the son has married six times ... ... and his brides die soon after the wedding .
why are you cleaning up ?
you still have work to do .
we thought it was payday .

the young master was bitten by a poisonous snake .
snakebite ?
it' s too late .
he' s dead .

something terrible happened on the way .
don' t talk nonsense .
vampires vampires
pal , there' s no need to put up a show like this for me .
we all know why you married your sister to the jiangs .
the jiangs are loaded .
i m sure they' il pay off your gambling debts .
what' s all this got to do with you ?
i il pay you back when i want to , and i say you' il get paid soon .
fine .
okay with me .
i have money .
but my men need money .
of course , i could ask them to cut you a break
are you threatening me with these scumbags ?
is this how you repay a debt ?
you just killed my men
i m going to beat you up
where are you ?
i sent a whole gang out to rob jiang and only one comes back ?
you should be disciplined .
i am giving the compass a break , and now it keeps raining .
you said the bride doesn' t concern us .
right .
but i see she' s got you under her spell .
right .
we' re supposed to catch the snake .
right .
the compass seems to be working .
what do you think happened here ?
you saw a bird last night in the forest ?
yeah .
let' s go take a look .
why did you flirt with her ?
you know the line of business we' re in ... ... ordinary people don' t understand it .
we can' t communicate with them .
it s hard to develop any relationships .
stop dreaming .
it s no use thinking about it .
who are you ?
i m just trying to make a living .
i was hired to find jiang' s gold .
please , give me a break
i see .
have you seen ghosts before ?
no .
you want to see one ?
this place is haunted .
lf you hang around , you' il definitely bump into one .
there are no ghosts here no ?
didn' t you feel a shiver on your back up there ?
you' il see them sooner or later .
them ?
you know what i mean .
ghosts ?
and worse have you heard of vampires ?
yes , vampires .
but i il give you a break .
i m a good scout .
you tell the others that there are vampires here .
tell them to keep away .
okay .
leave by boat .
vampires hate water .
okay .
where do i get a boat ?
goddamn vampires .
what are you looking for ?
you .
i ran into a bandit searching for jiang' s gold .
everyone wants to find out about the gold .
what were you doing in the forest ?
i went to check out funny noises .
good .
thunder has sasa and i have you .
dear brother , i know once a woman is married ... ... according to tradition , she must remain with her husband .
but this jiang household is really strange .
i don' t think i can stay here much longer .
i hope you understand my situation .
please , help me get out of here .
your sister , sasa .
the snake .
the snake
is anybody here ?
anybody here ?
sasa , what are you doing ?
the house seems to be deserted .
what' s wrong with that ?
soon you' il get used to the peace and quiet .
our house is huge , don' t wander around , you could get lost .
father jiang , can' t you please let me go home ?
my husband is dead  do you miss him ?
i can take you to him .
what ?
take me to him ?
you dropped your letter .
you' d better pick it up .
son , we' ve come to see you .
what happened to him ?
our family is famous for preserving bodies .
we air dry them and then preserve them with wax .
others only last for a few years ... ... but our technique is guaranteed for life .
don' t worry , you' il never be lonely .
my son will be with you forever .
last night , when your wife was sitting next to you ... ?
you are a smart girl .
she is just like your husband , she has been preserved .
she' il remain here forever .
sometimes it is a blessing for a couple when one of them can' t talk .
don' t worry , i il make sure that you get the same treatment when you die .
you' il be here forever .
no .
no .
this is it .
nice jump .
you could scare us to death .
stop searching , they' re all over
just like a wax museum .
maybe there' s a vampire hiding among these bodies .
gold
this must be the jiangs ' gold .
i wonder how much they are worth .
we' re here for the vampire , not the treasure .
you' re right .
don' t be silly .
we should forget the vampire .
right .
ldiot lf the vampire shows up , we won' t live to enjoy the gold
the sun' s going down now .
you' re right .
you didn' t tell me there are vampires at the jiangs ' mansion .
people made up the vampire stories .
i was partially responsible for them too .
many people are scared but it' s just a rumor , that' s all .
relax , i' ve worked for the jiangs for years .
i have everything arranged .
everything will go smoothly .
after all those years , you don' t know where he hides his gold ?
old man jiang was once a police chief .
he' s very smart and careful .
so l
the brides are dead .
you must find that snake .
the snake might bite my sister too .
what' s your excuse ?
they' re hunting the snake right at this moment .
my sister' s in danger .
what if the old man takes advantage of her ?
what are you going to do ?
there' s man who can help us .
this guy' s called a zombie wrangler .
his job is to make the dead move again .
old jiang is not dead , so why would we need this guy ?
actually , for generations , the jiangs ... ... have preserved the dead with wax .
we can ask the zombie wrangler to wake up all of the waxed corpses .
just imagine all of those bodies jumping all over the place .
the old man will be busy rounding them all up ... ... that will be our chance to sneak into his house and look for the gold .
it s a perfect plan .
we' il ask him to show you .
i don' t buy this crap
they' re already dead .
why bother them ?
they died in foreign places and i have to help them .
i have to bring them back home to bury them tonight .
you are the zombie wrangler ?
let' s see how good you are .
is that the best you can do ?
tell me ... ... are you here to talk or to fight ?
sir , we are here for your help .
we need you to awaken ... ... all of the corpses in jiang' s house .
here' s the down payment .
please accept it .
help you ?
it s no problem , i do it all the time .
you saw what i saw , but ... ... she' s mine to protect
let' s put it this way , she' il be your sister in law .
we were just trying to watch out for you .
lf anything happens , we' re in it together .
quiet down if she hears us , it' s all over for me
i m serious about her .
she' s mrs. jiang , not your girlfriend .
right .
but they didn' t sleep together .
i still have a chance .
anyway , you' il help me out is that right ?
you all come with me .
master .
what now ?
they' re all waxed bodies .
the compass doesn' t show anything .
they are all still dead .
you were spying on the young mistress while she was bathing .
you shouldn' t have done that .
it s a serious offense .
what , you can look and we can' t ?
according to our family rules , i must gouge your eyes out
i looked with a pure heart ... ... but he' s just a dirty bastard
what' s the difference ?
you dirty bastard
say that again ?
i mean you
i thought you' re bulletproof .
what if i am ?
you' re on your own .
are you okay ?
you push too hard .
so you are the unbeatable one ?
i thought you couldn' t be defeated .
my turn
we better burn all of these corpses .
hold it
we can' t start a fire here .
we might burn the house down .
let' s move them out .
right
what now ?
there may be other corpses , we have to burn them tool
let' s double check .
with whom ?
we' il pin down the old man and force him to tell us .
okay .
just who are you guys ?
are you here to try to rob me ?
with your fighting skills , why are you pretending to be servants ?
we' re after vampires .
he' s right .
we suspect that all these corpses ...
... could turn into vampires , then  ridiculous
that' s just a rumor ... ... to keep the bandits away .
ever since we became rich ... ... the family members never stopped fighting .
it led to the fall of our family .
never mind , i won' t punish you .
lf you can help me get rid of my problems ... ... i il adopt one of you as my godson ... ... and you can carry on the family line and inherit my fortune .
i know this should have been my duty ... ... but i il also let one of you marry my daughter in law .
look no further .
i il do it .
i will restore your family' s name .
are you nuts ?
what did he say to the old man ?
restore the glorious days .
what' s that noise ?
what' s that noise ?
where' s the compass ?
let' s check it out .
they' re here .
where are you going ?
let' s move .
what' s going on ?
what' s going on ?
that' s jiang' s house .
sasa' s still there
i ve got to save her .
what about us ?
let' s get our tools .
this is terrible he , help me
where are you , sasa ?
i m over here
move away
are you hurt ?
my foot .
let me carry you .
i haven' t adopted you yet how dare you carry her
why are they moving ?
stop them
someone is using magic to awaken them .
who are your enemies ?
enemy ?
you are my enemy
get down
what was that ?
a vampire
we' ve been hunting him for months .
i started that rumor to protect this place .
it s not a rumor anymore .
it s the vampire king .
what ?
the rumors are true ?
someone is controlling them , someone is calling them .
how many people know about your gold hidden in the storage room ?
who are you ?
how do you know about my hiding place ?
i ....
we ....
i see .
you and the other three are all after my money
lf i were , i wouldn' t have come back to rescue her
liar you just want her and my gold
not bad .
i understand , you' re a decoy so your friends can steal my gold right ?
lf someone is plundering your gold right now , it' s not my friends .
go check it out
what are you holding a rock for ?
i was just trying to help .
take me out of here .
please .
but , master jiang ... ?
you don' t want me to be here forever , do you ?
of course not .
let' s go
where are we going ?
this is a powerful vampire .
we must keep going , maybe we' il get away .
he' s behind us
we seem to have lost him .
you can let go now .
it s all right .
i feel better now .
you can open your eyes now .
where are we ?
this is where we found the vampire king .
we took a wrong turn
run
this way
he' s there
marry me if i survive .
i will .
thank you , sasa .
goodbye
mas
he can' t see you if you' re wet
he' s coming
run run
oh , no the jacket' s too short
stay in the water and you' il be safe
jump into the well okay
what now , master ?
there' s no water here
get ready .
master , it' s raining i know .
i m sure it' s in here .
this is the only place i ve never been in .
i bet the old man must have hidden the gold here .
why were you making us run around till now ?
will the old man be back soon ?
relax .
we woke up all the corpses .
it will take him forever to round them up .
we' d better hurry before he comes back .
it s too late for you now .
you married your younger sister to my son for money
that' s right this was my plan all along
you can' t use up all the money you have now .
be reasonable .
don' t try to hold on to what you don' t need .
why is it your business how i spend my money ?
because we are family now .
family ?
you knew where the gold is , but you still took me running around ?
look out
he wants us to fight so he could grab all the money .
be careful .
we' re both here to steal don' t listen to him
i il be waiting for you outside .
don' t worry , i won' t be able to run away from you .
it s easier to take it from him than from you .
i fulfilled two wishes today .
i got what i was owed for marrying my sister into your family ... ... and i also defeated you .
which proves i m a better fighter .
look what' s behind you .
i m not falling for that old trick .
look what' s behind you .
look what' s behind you .
look what' s behind you .
i only believe in myself .
why is she not awake yet ?
will she be okay ?
she is tired from running around all night .
where are your partners ?
they' re getting ready for the vampire .
the vampire has been to many places .
many people are infected .
i followed him for months after we were separated .
then i stopped here to look for you and the vampire at the same time .
but we never saw you .
we' ve been looking for you for months .
who' s she ?
my wife .
we just got married .
while the vampire was chasing us , we
did you take advantage of her when she was vulnerable ?
do you feel the smoke ?
could it be fog ?
fog doesn' t smell .
she' s burning .
this is not an ordinary wound .
this was inflicted by a vampire .
she' s been infected .
she' il turn into a vampire within seven days .
maybe sooner .
you better prepare for the worst .
although we haven' t known each other for long
but it' s not hopeless .
really ?
she might be cured by powdered coffin wood .
might be ?
but you were sure just now
i said it' s not hopeless , but that doesn' t mean it is curable .
at least there is hope
she' s calling you .
sasa , i m over here .
is there something wrong with my ears ?
why does my voice sound strange ?
really ?
i don' t think so .
master , do you think her voice is strange ?
start preparing the wood .
your ears are okay .
hey ....
hey ....
where is sasa ?
do she miss me ?
are you young master jiang ?
you sound so strange .
i ve been dead for a while .
i can hardly speak .
come here quickly and help me .
is that master tailor ?
i was before .
you' ve been dead .
that' s right , it' s been some time now .
what' s happening ?
i thought the vampire myth was just a story ... ... but this is all real .
they are real .
we haven' t known each other long ... ... but i m true to you .
jiang' s zombies have all been feeding .
soon they' il turn into vampires .
but they can be destroyed if they' re exposed to the sun .
master master
stop crying .
master
i m scared .
can we leave now ?
let me check .
don' t leave me .
do you really want to marry me ?
i gave you my word .
i il never lie to you .
master
what now ?
it knows we' re here .
it knows we are coming after him .
master , no response .
this thing has tasted my sword before .
he' s still afraid of it .
let' s go
you can' t come .
wait for me in a safe place in town .
no , i want to come with you .
it s too dangerous .
trust me , i will come back .
but do me a favor before i leave .
what is it ?
i want to hear you say that you' il wait for me .
i il wait for you .
don' t worry , i will be back .
don' t touch the gold
master , it' s a wired net .
be careful
i don' t care what you are here for ... ... but this is where you' re all going to die .
mr. jiang , it' s better to rest in peace than to be one of the living dead .
there' s no point in hanging on .
i want an heir for the jiang family .
this is all about face .
i need to preserve our family .
your whole life' s governed by face , isn' t that miserable ?
dragon , you love gold , kill them all and you can have all the gold .
okay , give me the gold ... ... and you can have my sister ... ... to carry on your family legacy .
spread out

it s been feeding on master jiang and dragon .
