crlmson rlvers
we' il touch base in two hours .
which way do we go ?
there .
okay ?
see you later , guys .
can i help you ?
got a light ?
who let you through ?
your men ...
commissioner pierre niemans .
just you ?
paris said they' d send a unit .
what the hell ?
i' m the unit .
captain ,
i didn' t drive all night to wage war with cops .
what' s the low down ?
follow me .
two days ago , the college dean reported remy callois missing .
thirty two years old , single .
remy lectured at the college .
he was also the librarian .
an upper echelon job there .
according to the dean , remy was punctual and hardworking .
he never showed up late .
yesterday afternoon a young mountain climber found his body .
why call in the vice squad ?
we' re not used to this kind of stuff .
why ?
his body was strung up there ...
at 150 feet .
you' re vice but not really vice , is that it ?
that' s it .
we never dealt with you before .
you' re lucky .
happy is he who penetrates the hidden causes of things
what' s this college doing here ?
no ordinary college : it provides its own electricity , its own water .
it even has a hospital .
1200 students .
100 professors and researchers .
one of europe' s oldest universities .
in case of a snowstorm , it can survive for a month .
the dean is like the mayor of the valley .
he runs most ofthe region .
here' s where they form future bill gateses .
future what ?
future bill gateses ...
the hospital' s attached to the college ?
it' s open to everyone in the region .
we all get free health care .
we work a lot with them .
there' s even a maternity wing .
this is commissioner niemans .
he' il be helping on this case .
i was in your criminology class in 1987 .
did you start yet ?
i haven' t cut the cord .
can we see ?
i figured you' d want to see him intact .
it' s incredible .
the work of a real madman .
he strove for the fetal position .
what position ?
the fetal .
like a fetus in its mother' s belly .
he' s been dead for 48 hours .
examination reveals traces of incisions on the shoulders , arms , elbows and thighs made by a sharp instrument .
a carpet cutter .
can you cut the cord ?
four broken ribs .
arms broken at the shoulders and elbows .
multiple fractures : tibia , hip ...
i' il put it all in a detailed report .
the hands were amputated before he died , with an axe . the stumps cauterized to avoid his bleeding to death .
the killer obviously wanted to keep his victim alive .
i wouldn' t do that ...
he carved out the eyes like a surgeon .
operating on a live patient .
what the fuck is this shit ?
the sockets were filled with rain .
it' s being analyzed .
there' s a good eye doctor in guernon .
he may shed some light on this .
how long did it take him to die ?
i' d have to cut him open , but i' d say 5 hours .
the size and precision of the wounds indicate that he wanted his victim conscious , but in the greatest possible state of pain .
check every prison , every loony bin and sect .
every trail , refuge and ski slope .
run random identity checks on drivers in a 100 mile radius .
dig up evidence of similar mutilations in the past 20 years .
talk to possible witnesses and callois ' colleagues .
anyone who knew his itinerary .
find out where it rained in the past two days .
find anything : witnesses , clues .
you have two hours .
who' s there ?
who' s there ?
who is it ?
why won' t you talk ?
doctor !
what' s going on ?
get the dog out of here .
it' s nothing .
go home .
everything' s all right .
see you on tuesday .
who are you ?
commissioner niemans .
sorry , dogs scare me shitless .
dogs are not to fear .
just their masters .
how can i help you ?
i' m investigating remy callois ' death .
i heard about it .
how awful .
did you know him ?
i knew his father .
we went to college together .
did you teach at the college ?
for 20 years .
but i stopped teaching ... in 1982 .
why ?
difference of opinion .
with the dean ?
i don' t understand ...
what' s the link between me and remy ?
i have some pictures i' d like your opinion of .
he was tortured ?
for several hours .
how horrible ...
i didn' t know .
no hands ?
nor eyes .
that' s why i' m here .
to understand these mutilations .
how would i know ?
what exactly do you treat ?
genetic afflictions concerning the eyes .
hereditary diseases transmitted from one generation to the next .
they strike isolated areas ... and with the college ...
what about the college ?
teachers have been marrying among themselves for ages .
the bloodlines are weak , worn out ...
genetic problems keep popping up .
the ransom of the elite .
i thought professors ' kids were prodigies .
they are .
i don' t get it .
over the past two generations , the situation has reversed .
the native mountain children are getting sick .
like the boy you just saw .
could there be a connection between the mutilations and the diseases ?
hands and eyes are the body parts that belong to us alone .
they' re different from anyone else' s , like with dna .
they' re our ... biological identity .
your killer is giving you hints as to his motive .
and he starts stabbing away ...
he stabs the dog , stabs the guy , grabs the bag and throws the knife under the car !
seriously , paris is full of psychos !
the subway !
the cops !
robo cops !
hand over your ticket , please !
what the hell ?
i' m happy with my cows !
i' m happy here !
fresh air !
it' s amazing here .
take a look at my cows !
it' s the county mounties !
hi , kids .
cool it ...
can we go now ?
happy squirrel hunting !
you want the roach ?
you smoke ?
i always have .
you didn' t before !
now i do .
you' re smoking on duty .
he does !
you' re lower on the totem pole .
where does that put you ?
harry and sally !
why did you come for me ?
the cemetery got robbed last night .
the word is " desecrated " .
the elementary school got desecrated too .
the word is " robbed " , dickwad .
two in a day !
we' re back in business , guys !
let' s start with the cemetery .
i' m riding high today .
pass the joint .
what now ?
nothing !
you' re sulking .
because you' re smoking !
do i sulk when you drink ?
cut the crap !
you sound like two old hookers .
you' re here for the desecration .
follow me ...
it' s the girl' s mausoleum .
the only mausoleum in the cemetery .
when i got here this morning , this is what i found .
it' s those skinheads .
they' re always hanging around here !
we have skinheads ?
not skinheads . just kids .
skinhead kids ?
just kid kids .
did this ever happen before ?
the first time .
1972 1982 .
she didn' t make it too far .
stop that !
you have no right .
you need her parents ' say so .
i know the law !
relax .
no problem .
where can i find the parents ?
her mother was crazy .
she said the devil killed her kid .
the devil ?
you heard me .
where are your skinheads ?
a warehouse in town .
let' s pay them a little visit .
first the school .
the principal' s expecting us .
what' s she missing ?
nothing' s missing .
that' s what' s so strange .
i' ve never seen you .
are you new here ?
is it that obvious ?
what did you do to end up here ?
cops are like teachers .
we can' t always choose our school .
tell me about it !
for 14 years , i' ve asked to be transferred !
they broke in here .
where we keep school records .
they went about it extremely carefully .
are you sure nothing' s missing ?
nothing at all .
i checked this morning .
it' s so weird !
i don' t understand .
okay ...
file a complaint at the station this afternoon .
so the investigation' s over ?
what can i say ?
no theft , no investigation .
have a nice day .
good bye .
good bye , detective .
detective " is pass .
it' s " lieutenant " now .
just a second !
how long have you been here ?
not as long as you seem to think .
if i say a name , could it ring a bell ?
try me ...
judith herault .
was she one of my students ?
she died in 1982 .
should i check ?
i' d appreciate it .
you think there' s a connection ?
you tell me ...
i wonder if she' s the one who got run over .
run over ?
killed in a highway accident .
it was terrible .
what else ?
it was a truck .
the mother was there .
she became insane .
how can i find the mother ?
what' s wrong ?
the pages are torn out .
the pages from ' 81 and ' 82 .
bingo !
any pictures ?
class photos ... stuff like that .
the pictures are missing too .
i' il be right back .
what' s the problem ?
any highway patrolmen here ?
not one .
they' re all out to lunch .
what for ?
i need some info .
i' m a cop myself .
information about what ?
an accident that happened around here 20 years ago .
it' s your lucky day .
they call me " gravedigger " .
over the past 27 years , i' ve seen 248 no , wait ... 249 accidents entailing deaths .
on our part of the highway alone .
50 miles !
cops and firemen get all the attention .
but we' re the first guys on the scene .
it' s all in here .
what do you want to know ?
you can use that ?
what do you think ?
i' m looking for the parents of a girl killed in ' 82 .
judith herault .
that sounds familiar .
here we go ...
mile marker 98 .
september ' 82 .
she was that kid ?
that' s right .
just a sec .
1982 ...
it' s coming back now .
she was run over by a 38 ...
what a goddamned mess !
here she is .
here' s her file , with the policemen' s statements , pictures and all ...
i' m warning you : the pictures are ...
don' t worry .
i warned you .
jesus !
what happened ?
a 38 ton truck going 80 miles an hour ...
how did you identify her ?
when we got there , the mother was at the side of the road .
she was holding ...
what ?
a finger .
the only piece of her daughter still intact .
she said her kid ran away and tried running across the highway .
god knows what happened .
you don' t have the mother' s number ?
are you kidding ?
it' s been 20 years !
the insurance company sent us an address in case we came across any new leads .
this is too crazy !
the dean' s office ?
that way , on your left .
i want to see the dean .
i' m his assistant .
how can i help ?
by getting me the dean , now .
who shall i say is here ?
commissioner niemans .
commissioner niemans for you .
have a seat .
i' il just be a minute .
i' m a slave to this university .
i never have enough time .
what can i do ?
i' m investigating callois ' death .
i spoke to captain dahmane .
tell me about remy' s private life .
do you work with dahmane ?
neither with nor without .
i lead a special unit .
you ...
i don' t understand what happened .
remy never posed the slightest problem .
he was kind , hardworking .
his parents were close friends .
he took over his father' s job in the library .
he went to school here ?
like most of us .
many students are born and grow up here .
some become professors , like their parents .
it' s sort of the tradition .
it was the case with remy .
he didn' t have a police record .
maybe there' s something we missed , that may be of help .
like what ?
someone who hated him .
drug use , some religious conviction ...
i think you misunderstood me .
this university is a community , a temple of knowledge .
everyone lives and works here in perfect harmony .
to accuse one of us is to accuse all of us , including me .
i want to visit his apartment .
i' m afraid that' s impossible .
the police sealed it off .
i' d like to see it all the same .
hubert , come here , please .
unfortunately , i can' t join you .
i hope you don' t mind if my son shows you the way .
as i told you , traditions are a way of life here .
we' ve been voted " best college " three years in a row .
we even helped raise the national average .
just for fun , we calculated the average iq here .
guess how much .
twenty four .
excuse me ?
callois had room 24 .
do you have the key ?
no .
do you have permission to go in ?
what did he do at the library ?
he was in charge of books and seating arrangements .
seating arrangements ?
our tradition is to be seated in the same place every year .
it' s beneficial and makes seating easier .
dominissimus , simusserve , ubicum que ...
we are the masters .
we are the slaves .
we are everywhere .
we are nowhere .
we control the crimson rivers .
it was his phd .
he' d been working on it for years .
fanny ferreira ?
up there .
fanny ferreira ?
you discovered remy callois ' corpse ?
who are you ?
pierre niemans .
i came from paris to investigate .
paris exports cops now ?
depends on the case .
too bad .
i like the local yokels .
their seriousness cracks me up .
me too .
you can make a difference ?
i' ve been trying to for 25 years .
maybe you can help .
i doubt it .
i didn' t see much .
i scaled the cliff twice before noticing him .
didn' t you read my statement ?
did the killer have to be strong to get the body up there ?
not necessarily .
with know how and good equipment , you can lift anything , anywhere .
what was he like ?
a pretentious asshole .
like most students here .
i agree .
it seems pretty ...
uptight ?
exactly .
a closed circuit race course for high performance cars .
if you' ve been around once ...
i read that you' re a glaciologist .
what do you do ?
i control avalanches .
the school' s in a valley , so i try to steer them away .
you protect the school .
i do my job .
like remy callois .
what ?
you went to , and worked for , the school , like remy callois .
so ?
you' re part of the clan .
what clan ?
the elite composed of professors ' kids .
i have a busy day and i don' t like uniforms .
your colleagues have my number .
it' s the pathologist .
i got the results of the water in his eyes .
it' s rain water ... acid rain .
what ?
it' s pretty common .
but we haven' t had any acid rain since the 1970s .
and it hasn' t rained recently .
i don' t get it .
it' s ice cold .
freezing .
hello , sister .
i' m a police officer ...
does a certain mrs. herault reside here ?
may i ask why ?
i' m sorry .
i' m afraid not .
i can' t say .
sister andre has been here for 17 years .
this concerns a relatively old incident .
could i possibly see her ?
i' il see ...
come in .
wait here .
take off your cap ...
where do you think you are ?
my son !
wait here .
sister andre will see you .
but i should warn you ...
what ?
you can speak to her , but you cannot see her .
you can listen , but you cannot go near .
why not ?
the shadows , my son .
what about the shadows ?
sister andre took the vow of the shadows .
we haven' t seen her for 15 years .
sister ...
sister andre ?
i' m a police officer from sarzac , just nearby ...
your daughter is buried there , right ?
judith was your daughter , wasn' t she ?
i' m here because last night someone tried to open her tomb .
they' re coming back .
who ?
they' re coming back to complete their mission .
who are you talking about ?
the demons .
they want to make sure judith won' t cause them any more trouble .
so it' s these demons who killed your daughter ?
could you try being a little more explicit ?
for 18 years i' ve been trying to forget .
last night , your demons broke into the school and stole judith' s class picture .
i need your help to understand why .
in order to erase every trace of my child .
what for ?
to protect their secret .
what secret ?
judith' s face is a threat to them .
please , sister ...
i' m sorry , but ...
can you tell me the circumstances of your daughter' s death ?
my daughter fell ill .
we went to the hospital she was born in .
then the demons attacked us .
they chased us .
i wanted to run away , to disappear with my daughter .
but they found us .
no one can escape their clutches .
where did you live before sarzac ?
the nightmare began in guernon .
did you try calling the police for help ?
i speak of demons and you speak of police .
there' s nothing you can do for my child .
save your soul while you still can .
leave me now .
i want to stop remembering .
forgive me .
glaciers are formed from years of compacted snow .
the snow is compressed into ice .
each season has a corresponding stratum .
this glacier is 600 feet deep .
it' s a huge source of water and energy .
the water composing it dates back centuries .
what' s the point of studying glaciers ?
the college power plant has a research lab .
this glacier is sliding .
we study the risk factor it represents .
here .
how far down do we have to go ?
at least 100 feet .
why did you choose me ?
there are great guides in the area .
they say you' re the best .
and i had you under my thumb .
you enlist civilians to find murderers ?
let' s say i' m picking you up .
put this on .
don' t walk on the rope .
welcome to the time machine , commissioner .
i' il compare this ice to the acid rain you had analyzed .
we' re at the right depth .
he must have brought us here for a reason .
there must be a clue ... a trace .
niemans , that' s dangerous !
we can' t stay here .
water can come gushing in at any second .
what' s back there ?
natural water canals .
what are you doing ?
where are you going ?
where are we ?
an intra glacial canal , dug out by the water that feeds the power plant .
we can' t stay here .
it' s dangerous .
let' s go .
what' s wrong ?
the light brigade !
what' il it be , guys ?
nothing today .
the chief wants to see your tenants .
in back .
what' s up ?
i' m coming .
stay here .
i' il have a word with them .
a glass of red ?
hello , gentlemen .
i' d like to speak to the manager .
the head honcho .
the leader of your little group .
what for ?
police .
i' m new in the neighborhood .
lt. max kerkerian .
i have some questions .
don' t bother .
we know you .
we don' t talk to cops .
i' il do the talking .
what can we do for you ?
tell me about your whereabouts last night .
what' s the problem ?
some kids sprayed swastikas on a mausoleum .
why ask us ?
skinheads , swastikas ... swastikas , skinheads ...
no swastikas here .
see any swastikas ?
what stickers ?
swastikas .
you' re not skinheads ?
so what ?
you didn' t do the school ?
what school ?

i' d say we' re dealing with a pointer .
a pointer ?
we go where he points .

what' s his name ?
philip sertys .
why ?
pierre niemans ?
great technique !
what are you looking for ?
don' t touch anything .
chill out .
can i breathe at least ?
the guy' s a real dog lover .
judith ...
we' re talking total dog freak .
wait !
what' s the problem ?
come on !
i can' t believe it !
mega cop is scared of pooches !
don' t worry .
come on ...
come here , sonny .
careful !
that one may bite !
you ever stop blabbing ?
just joking .
mother fuckers !
you know what this place is ?
the lab of a guy who experiments on dogs .
using genetics to make a perfect fight dog .
he has all the equipment .
look ...
this is really gross .
did you see ?
where are you going ?
where are you going ?
to see your suspect .
you know where he is ?
so where are we going ?
what do you want sertys for ?
desecration .
and you ?
where ?
in sarzac , about 60 miles from here .
why do you want him ?
sarzac .
where' s the lighter ?
do you never answer questions ?
or is it me ?
take a left .
okay , chief .
i' il take a left .
this will be a barrel of laughs .
sir ?
he' s with me .
so ?
same method of strangulation .
same killer .
i' m sure .
but this guy wasn' t tortured .
the hands aren' t torture ?
they were cut off after he died .
i don' t get a thing .
what i don' t get is why he still has his eyes .
did you start the autopsy ?
not yet .
there are no wounds .
there must be some clue .
what kind of clue ?
i' m not sure .
but i' m sure it' s here .
we have to look .
hold on ...
tweezers , please .
you won' t believe this .
glass eyes .
like in an eye doctor' s office or at medical school .
get your men and meet me at cherneze' s office .
tell me what' s going on !
you' re asking me ?
can i know where you' re going ?
butt out .
wait for me at the station .
you' re kidding !
he' s as much my witness as yours !
i didn' t make it this far to go back empty handed .
this isn' t child' s play .
i can' t be your teacher .
stop acting like some kind of living legend !
i can teach you too .
i work alone !
that makes two of us !
where are we ?
did you ever shoot someone ?
i never had to .
good .
i want him alive .
who ?
who , god damn it ?
what the fuck is this ?
what are we looking for ?
can you tell me ?
if you talk to me , maybe i can help .
the other stairway !
don' t move !
run !
i will track the source of the crimson rivers .
would it kill you to tell me what' s going on ?
i have no idea !
that' s an answer .
so ?
so i' m comparing the fingerprints .
there' s no match .
no criminal on our files .
can you scan this print ?
no problem .
what' s that ?
a girl who died 20 years ago .
she led me here .
if she died 20 years ago , we got a problem .
she' s the one who shot at you .
these prints are a perfect match with the ones on the gun , except for the age difference .
we need to talk .
so we talk now ?
last night sertys went to a cemetery .
into the vault of judith herault , who died in 1982 .
he couldn' t open the coffin , so he tried misleading us with swastikas .
that night , someone broke into the elementary school and stole pictures and documents from ' 81 and ' 82 , the two years judith herault attended that school .
she' s one of these kids .
how did she die ?
run over by a truck .
they called it an accident .
but the mother told me something completely different .
according to her , her daughter was killed by demons .
demons ...
she has a major screw loose .
she' s been in a convent since .
but i got the impression she wasn' t telling me all ...
did you grill her or have tea ?
i was investigating a misdemeanor .
i couldn' t punch her to get her to talk .
she' s a nun .
your turn .
tell me what' s going on .
it' s a treasure hunt .
each corpse leads to the next one .
let' s say that
sertys , callois and cherneze are linked by an incident that happened 20 years ago .
two days ago they learn callois is dead .
we find the body .
they panic .
the past resurfaces .
they go to the cemetery and the school to find something out ... to check something ...
but what ?
if judith is really dead .
why ?
she' s seeking revenge .
the nun probably faked her death .
and the prints ?
fingers can be cut off .
the guy who shot at me had five fingers .
why did he let you live ?
so i' d understand his vengeance .
what links the three victims ?
callois was head librarian .
sertys worked in the maternity ward .
cherneze worked with the dean .
it all leads to the university .
i better get back .
what about me ?
see if judith is dead .
i knew you' d say that .
i get the fun stuff .
call me with any news .
what are you doing here ?
your colleagues held me for four hours .
sorry ...
everyone' s on edge .
want a ride ?
sure ...
so cherneze is dead too ?
did you know him ?
one ofthe college' s last dinosaurs .
you don' t seem to appreciate the geniuses you live among .
i don' t respect intellectuals much .
weren' t your parents professors ?
i don' t respect my parents much .
take a left here .
is anyone expecting you ?
you' re a lousy don juan .
nice place .
i like it .
it' s far from everything .
no tv , no radio , even cell phones don' t work .
a grenade ?
i use them to trigger avalanches .
are all the locals like you ?
battling mountains helps forge your character .
same goes for cops .
have you been one for long ?
too long .
buy lighter fluid .
i should .
but i' m trying to quit .
it was a gift .
from your ex ?
i never got married .
how about you ?
almost .
with the dean' s son .
that could never work .
it sure was intended to .
after three years face to face in a reading room , you get close .
why do you hate the school so much ?
why do you suspect me ?
you climb mountains .
you found the first body , helped me find the second .
you' re the perfect suspect .
except for one thing .
what ?
you' re incapable of strangling someone for ten minutes , eye to eye .
i have to go .
thanks for the tea .
tell me about remy callois ' thesis .
he talks about the myth of olympus ,
greek athletes who combined mind and body .
he refers a lot to the berlin olympic games of 1936 when german athletes fueled nazi propaganda .
and crimson rivers ?
flow with the blood of perfect men .
blood ?
veins ...
you want my opinion ?
seriously , this thesis is a potpourri of nazi crap .
at the end , it' s like " how to be a perfect fascist .
he explains how to create a perfect man of today .
how ?
by combining brawny kids with brainy ones .
by selecting them and marrying them .
it' s called ...
eugenics .
eugenics , that' s it .
like nazis tried in some villages during the war .
like at this school .
healthy minds ... in healthy bodies .
what are you doing ?
you have no business here !
what role did callois play exactly ?
callois ...
sertys ...
cherneze ...
it all leads here .
what are you after ?
you suspect us , don' t you ?
victims can be guilty too .
watch what you say , niemans .
i inquired about you .
you' re on the razor' s edge ...
i' d gladly put you first on the list .
all that' s stopping me is the desire to prove you' re behind it all .
am i wrong ?
am i ?
stop it !
are you crazy ?
you' il be hearing from me !
can' t i leave you alone for a minute ?
what did you find in the tomb ?
i don' t know if it' il be any help .
it' s not her .
you know her ?
she helped with the case .
she helped you ?
to understand the meaning of the crimson rivers .
they' ve lived in a closed circuit here for ages .
inbreeding led the professors to start having degenerate kids .
so they needed new blood .
new blood ?
in the maternity wing , they replaced professors ' kids with healthy newborn mountain babies .
sertys ' father exchanged fanny with judith ?
and plenty of others .
what for ?
to create a superior race .
nazis ?
a freaking nazi college ?
not a college .
a breeding ground .
shoot !
shoot !
it' s bulletproof .
aim for the same spot .
go on , shoot !
are you okay ?
who' s this bastard ?
the dean' s son .
what did he want ?
to stop us from knowing what they did to fanny .
what could he do to fanny ?
he was ten back then .
he was exchanged .
he was seated with fanny at the library .
he should have married her .
that was the plan .
so then why is she killing them all off ?
she refuses to play by their rules .
you think she' s innocent ?
my coat !
hold on ... " la niemans " ...
who is this babe ofyours ?
lady cliffhanger ?
shit !
are you still not sure ?
to think she brought me here !
i could have seen it all .
she could have operated on you too !
she didn' t want to kill me .
she left me alive .
what are you talking about ?
she left you alive , but three other guys didn' t make it .
your girlfriend' s hobby is to cut up her boyfriends .
why the treasure hunt ?
what are you talking about ?
she' s a schizoid !
a psycho killer !
she wants us to understand .
what' s to understand ?
she wants to get caught .
good news .
that' s our job , right ?
now we just have to find her .
that' s our job ...
what now ?
she took the grenades .
what grenades ?
closed up like a fucking clam ...
did you evacuate the college ?
i need an explanation first !
it' s not the time for explanations .
evacuate .
this can' t go on .
who' s up there ?
i go alone .
it' s everyone or no one !
i' m going alone .
everyone freeze !
calm down ...
no one is coming .
have you gone berserk ?
give me that .
trust me .
lower your arms .
we have to go all the way now .
leave her to me .
down there !
fanny , turn around .
come down .
this is the end .
it' s over now .
i know who you are .
you know nothing !
stop it !
i know what they did to you .
exchanging newborn babies ...
killing kids ...
i know .
it' s too late .
you can' t help .
go away !
you led me here .
i can' t turn back .
neither can i !
don' t do that !
they' il close down the college .
they' re all dead now .
you' il kill innocent people .
they' re all guilty !
no one is innocent !
judith ?
twins !
they exchanged twins !
just one .
that' s why her face was a threat to them .
take care of her .
so who died in the car accident ?
what about the fingerprint ?
mommy prepared it all .
the other girl was already dead .
mommy planned everything .
except your going haywire .
you thoughtyou' d make it ?
i don' t intend to make it .
freeze or you really won' t make it .
stop !
leave her alone !
i' il trigger an avalanche .
fanny , listen to me .
stay away !
the men who hurt you are all dead .
if you do this , they' il win .
only you can stop her , fanny .
you' re not a monster like her .
stop before it' s too late .
i have no choice .
you do .
stop !
kill him .
for our lives .
for those of our parents .
for the lives they stole from us .
kill him .
not him .
he' s innocent .
kill him !
do it for me .
for the life i never had .
a life in your shadows .
they created you .
and they rejected me .
do it .
kill him , fanny .
kill him !
you wanted him to understand .
you can' t do that .
it' s you and me .
go on .
go on !
don' t .
you' re not like her .
but i am .
do it !
you had to understand , so no one could forget .
i know ...
hurry !
take her feet !
can i ask a question ?
what do you have against dogs ?
it was a long time ago ...
