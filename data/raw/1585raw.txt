then the earth shook and trembled ...
sorry , padre .
my bad .

he bowed the heavens also and came down .
and darkness was ...
did you notice how many hot chicks were at that funeral ?
no kidding !
it was like a discotheque with a coffin in the middle .
look at that .
holy ...
fort cooper .
can you believe it ?
god , i remember it being taller .
there it is .
race you to the top !
dano , come on up !
come on , dan .
you guys are hammered !
i' m not climbing up a 20 year old rope .
that' s crazy .
tommy , catch .
this whole thing seems a little insane for us to be doing , climbing with the possibility of ...
you all right , dano ?
come on , dano , grab it .
give me the rope .
come on , dan !
use your tippy toes .
there you go .
cobweb .
look out .
oh , my god .
how small is that door ?
kind of seems about the same , actually .
i hope i don' t fall through the floor of this thing .
hey !
what' s up , b. a. baracus ?
mr. t. how awesome is that ?
you guys .
oh , my gosh .
look at this .
hey , that' s our old flag .
d. b. cooper' s treasure chest .
oh , man , look at that thing .
you remember this ?
of course , yeah .
cooper parachuted out of a plane up north with a bunch of stolen cash .
we were obsessed with that .
nationwide police hunt and ...
right .
never found .
yeah , we were gonna sneak away , go up the river , all huck finn , apocalypse now style .
get the loot .
i bet you we spent half our childhood planning that trip .
it' s all billy ever talked about .
let' s open it up .
we have to break the lock .
oh , i' il break it .
38 24 36 .
how did he know that ?
how do you possibly remember that ?
miss 1981 , julie mcdonald .
38 24 36 .
unforgettable .
had a passion for cycling .
disliked liars .
you' re right .
what the ... ?
do you believe it ?
man !
look at that .
the oath ...
we swear that these things will remain in this box until we find d. b. cooper' s treasure .
signed , a bunch of kids .
remember we pricked our fingers , took a blood oath ?
dan , what' s that next to your signature ?
that' s not blood .
it was earwax .
i was afraid of needles .
should we check out the priceless treasures of our youth ?
c 3po .
i wonder who put that in .
let me see .
that' s a collectible now .
yeah , right .
my brian bosworth rookie card .
the boz .
man , i thought he was gonna be the greatest ever .
i' ve been in that box a very long time .
well , you' re free now .
and , tom , i believe this is your contribution .
oh , my god .
that' s my first rubber .
boy ...
i found this in my dad' s pickup right before he went to jail .
i remember he caught me with it .
boy , he smacked me right in the head .
what a charming father and son tale .
he was funny .
hey , what did billy put in there ?
yeah , what does he got ?
his indy compass .
i gave this to him before he took off on his trip .
he must' ve ...
i don' t know , he must' ve put it back .
look at this .
it' s one of our mix tapes .
remember we did the dj intros ?
yeah , let' s not wang chung tonight .
burn that .
you guys , check out this map .
looks like billy left us a treasure map .
look at that .
not only that ...
this map looks new .
he plotted out the whole trip .
billy thought d. b. landed right here .
there' s no way he did this as a kid .
he must' ve been adding to the box over the years .
this is the camping trip he wanted us to take last summer .
i couldn' t go .
i was detained in mexico .
and he wouldn' t do it unless we were all together .
i swear to god , i think he figured it out .
i mean , look at all this research .
he reconstructed the jump .
he pinpointed d. b. ' s landing .
that' s crazy .
my god ...
i' m sorry , you guys , we made an oath .
it all goes back in the box .
it all goes back in the box until we find the treasure .
so let' s go find it .
let' s ...
let' s take billy' s trip .
come on , guys , what do you say ?
i say , " hell , yes .
hell , yes !
right ?
we' il get a canoe .
right ?
no .
no .
no , i' m ...
no .
we' re all going .
listen , i wanna get a lot of rope .
a rope' s good .
all right , i know you guys won' t grasp this concept , but i have patients and ...
i am a doctor now .
i am dr. mott now !
i have responsibilities !
your responsibility is to come treasure hunting with us .
we' re 30 .
this might be the last chance we have to do something incredibly stupid together .
i agree .
for billy , dano .
not fair .
i think it' s fair .
all right .
time to re up on our oath , boys .
fingers up .
hey , put that away .
tom ...
i love the way you work .
you know who i' m talking to .
there' s no way i' m going .
no chance !
no !
you guys , no !
hey .
let go of me !
hey !
no , no .
no !
i hate you guys .
oh , we hate you too , dr. quinn , medicine woman .
hey !
hey !
i agreed to come .
you said i could drive .
we drive by my rules .
no kissing me .
i can' t believe that billy kept the duke in running shape all these years .
318 v8 , man .
they' re bulletproof .
how about a little fort cooper classic .
this is rocking billy newwood .
i' m here with fellow djs
jazzy jerry .
yeah !
gonzo tommy .
yeah !
and disco dan .
burn , baby , burn !
i' ve had sex with tom .
i totally did , though .
usually it' s too late when you do you know the words ?
realize what you had
and my mind goes back to a girl i left some years ago
who told me
just hold on loosely
but don' t let go
the boys together , the open road .
good tunes , good times .
good god !
let' s pull off memory highway .
but i' m never off , always on to the break of dawn
c o m p t o n
and the city they call long beach
putting the shit together
if it' s good enough to take them off a proper chunk
i' il take a small piece of some of that funky stuff
it' s like this and like that and like this and ...
how do you know all these words ?
he' s a doctor .
doctors study other doctors ' work .
you' re a secret dr. dre fan .
oh , god .
it' s like this and like that and like this ...
no , this is a metropolis .
look at this .
this place is very remote .
i wish i would' ve brought my dancing shoes so we can go clubbing .
let' s find the nearest hospital .
stay at the ritz .
this is great .
how are you ?
hi .
where are we ?
corner of bumfuck and you got a purty mouth .
hey , i' m gonna make a call .
oh , wait , jerry , you should use my new cell phone .
it' s a satellite phone , so it works everywhere .
and it' s got a camera and it' s got an address book and , listen , it' s even got a personalized ring .
nice .
you shouldn' t be proud of that , dan .
thanks .

i can' t wait to see you .
what you looking at , boy ?
here' s the thing , the guys and i ...
we' re going on a treasure hunt .
and i know that sounds dumb , but it' s something that we have to do .
for billy .
that doesn' t sound dumb at all .
i completely understand .
you do ?
just call me when you get a chance .
but i might be out of the house .
for a bit .
yeah , because my girlfriends and i , we' re gonna go on a search for the lost city of atlantis .
maybe my treasure will help buy your submarine .
maybe .
maybe it will .
take a picture .
hold on .
i' m on the little guy' s back .
shut up .

that' s good .
that' s good .
hello ?
that did not sound like it went well .
hiya , boys .

looks like someone ordered a set of teeth .
i beg your pardon .
taser guns .
dropping them off .

where was it you said you was headed ?
we' re just taking a trip .
our old friend , billy , he made this map ...

no .
but i ate a brownie once .
you don' t wanna play on the big river , boys .
oh , no , we' re not playing , we' re ...
i got this .
you listen to me .
i know a thing or two about rapid riding because i was a white water guide in northern california , nocal .
here' s the thing .
i know how to read a river better than you can read a book .
just a little better .
all right .
all right .
so we' re gonna get going ?
that' s right .
thank you , sheriff .
see you , ray bans .
you think we got enough booze , tom ?
maybe you wanna hire a bartender to come on the trip with us .
what' s a camping trip without beer ?
well , it' s still a camping trip , actually , just with less vomiting .
i hear you' re a river guide .
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
class iv , v ?
which is it ?
why don' t you try putting those numbers together .
that' s right .
i' ve shot a class 45 , and i' ve never lost a man .

you guys are spraying me !
give me a break ,
i' m writing your name !
stop it !
hey , don' t , don' t , don' t !
what , are you gonna melt ?
no , but this water is teeming with microbes .
they don' t bring losers to the swag pot !
so this is spirit river .
we take that to widowmaker bend .
and then we hike the devil' s staircase , and that should lead us to the top of hellfire ridge .
what' s with all these satanic names ?
isn' t there , like , a fluffy bunny way ?
no , but there' s a shut up you big baby ridge .
okay , just keep your eyes open
for our first day' s marker .
what' s that ?
it' s a rock formation called grandpa' s nose .
grandpa' s nose .
looking for grandpa' s nose .
i think i see it !
it' s right there .
good work , dan .
prepare to port .
i' m gonna drink some beer !
i predict you' il be puking in that river before the end of the night , tom .
dry timber ...
hi there , coalminer' s daughter .
you want a hand ?
or you can always try these fancy new things called " matches .
i saw how to do this on the discovery channel .
okay ?
and i' m gonna do it .
i got it covered .

stop , drop and roll !
why would you do that ? !
i' m with my face right next to the ...
and you blow ...
why would you do that ? !
it' s warm .
it' s a nice fire .
hey .
we did it .
i told you .
do you really wanna hurt me ?
do you really wanna hear this crap ?
please .
you liked this song just as much as i did .
when we were kids , it didn' t matter what the song was .
we weren' t wrapped up in what was cool and uncool .
we just listened to the music .
it should be like that now .
just listen to the song , man .
this song is so uncool .
well , i like it .
it soothes me .
dan , what is wrong with you ?
i' m blessed with good taste .
one day , you' il see , i' ve always been correct .
don' t get cocky , 30 year old dr. mott , with 46 years of school under his belt .
excuse me for getting an md and starting a successful practice .
excuse me .
i found a way to make 12 grand a month without having an md .
really ?
how do you do that ?
you running immigrants over the border again , coyote ?
those guys fell asleep in my truck .
i thought i' d just gotten shitfaced and bought a bunch of sombreros .
i didn' t know there were dudes underneath .
for real , though ?
selling harleys .
it' s the greatest gig on the planet .
congrats .
i' m happy for you .
seriously , though , you guys both sound
like you' re doing great .
aren' t you ?
i just don' t know if i' m cut out for the whole family wife kids thing .
i would kill to have a woman at home willing to have sex with me every night .
at work , i just sit in my office and i think ,
there' s gotta be something better out there . " you know what i mean ?
i thought you liked your job .
i like to surf .
sitting out in the water .
waiting for that perfect wave .
and i also like being out here .
i like this , right now .
the first time in months , no worries , no responsibilities .
just living in the moment .
just like billy did .
hey .
here' s to billy .
to our dead friend .
get them up .
tom ...
dano , whatever happened between you and cockeyed katie , anyway ?
you know , i don' t appreciate the name calling .
katie was very attractive .
it was a mutual separation .
yeah , between her eyes .
that girl had not one , but two wandering eyes .
it was like her eyes were trying to escape from her head .
you know , tom , i' m sorry she wasn' t up to your high standard of women .
no tattoos below the waist , never worked as a carny .
name one girlfriend of mine who worked as a carny .
jo jo , the one who had her downstairs pierced .
oh , jo jo .
that' s one .
how do you know what she did with her downstairs ?
jojosdownstairs .
com .
that was a good one .
hey , dano , let' s see what you packed us for dinner .
what is this , astronaut food ?
no .
it' s a vitamin gel pack .
it tastes like watermelon .
it' s very filling and it preserves well for camping .
i' m not an astronaut .
i' m an american .
and there' s fresh salmon in that river for the taking .
what ?
i' m eating salmon tonight .
that' s great , except we didn' t bring any fishing gear .
don' t need any .
we' il shine them .
that would kill a fish .
shine the fish , old cherokee trick .
i forgot the cherokee had been using the flashlight for thousands of years .
no , didn' t they pioneer the d battery ?
all right , suckers .
let' s see who' s eating salmon tonight and who' s eating crow .
do you have a crow catching trick ?
yuk it up , astronauts .
they love figure eights .
hey , 100 grand and my left nut says the only thing you catch out there is a cold .
got it !
grab it !
what are you doing ? !
fantastic .
can you do that again ?
you owe me 100 grand and the left nut .
are you gonna catch it when i throw it up ?
yeah , yeah !
yeah , yeah , come on !
i' m gonna have to use a distinct pattern now .
they got used to the figure eight .
it' s gonna be tough , but i' il focus .
what the hell are you doing ?
i toss it , you grab it .
that' s your part of the deal .
what ?
what are you doing ?
i' m taking off my shoes .
why ?
because i run faster with no shoes .
you can' t outrun that bear .
i don' t have to outrun the bear .
i just have to outrun you .
stay calm .
it' s important that you don' t let them smell your fear .
just follow my lead .
what are you gonna do ?
it' s a bear !
we' re all gonna die !
run !
keep going !
get out !
go away !
go !
get out !
stay calm .
get in the fetal position .
oh , god .
it won' t bother you if you' re in the fetal position .
nothing' s gonna happen now .
is he gone ?
is he gone ?
abort the fetal position !
it' s not working !
it' s not working !
run !
no ...
the bear thinks dan' s her cub .
what do we do now ?
stay ...
stay down .
don' t make eye contact .
help me !
let' s go .
this is bad .
this is really bad .
do something .
go first .
no , you go first .
hey .
where' s the bear ?
he' s trying to fatten dan up so they can hibernate together .
chew it up and eat it .
eat it .
stop pretending .
dan , you have to eat it .
you have to actually eat it .
okay .
bite .
eat it .
it' s delicious .
very good , thank you .
is there another one ?
that was good .
that was real good .
let' s go .
okay .
move , move , move .
up the tree .
your mom misses you .
she' s in my stuff .
hey , that' s my phone .
she ate my phone .
how long do you think she' il keep looking for me ?
hour , hour and a half , tops .
bears have very short attention spans .
i know a guy who trains them .
what was that ?
i don' t know , but it scared away our friend .
let' s get out of here .
what do you think could happen if this thing went off right in the boat ?
you think we' d die ?
i think you throw it right now .
what if i toss it to you and then you throw it ?
elwood , throw it !
cue the insane hillbillies .
what are these freaks doing ?
they' re fishing .
why aren' t they using their flashlights , tom ?
this is exactly what you hear about when people go into the deep woods in the middle of summertime .
aside from getting all sorts of diseases and things , they just wind up being the victims of some kind of unexpected man rape .
how you like me now , boy ?
i don' t like this ...
quiet .
go , go .
she ate everything .
including my very expensive cell phone .
all right , let' s load up .
there' s treasure in them hills .
wait a minute , you' re not actually considering continuing , are you ?
why not ?
well , because i just ...
i got carried away by a bear .
and then we spent the night sleeping in a tree .
well , we got that out of the way .
now we can get back on the river .
there comes a time in every cub' s life when he needs to strike out and make it on his own .
fine .
fine .
but i say we avoid them and we launch around the bend there , okay ?
all right , all right .
heave ho .
they call this portage .
or portage .
what' s the map say , jerry ?
you know , it' s a map .
it' s gonna be ...
it' s gonna be good .
jer , isn' t the river supposed to fork ?
no .
it just goes straight the whole way .
straight shot .
are you sure ?
we are back in business , boys .
all right .
let' s rudder back .
bring the tail out .
it' s getting kind of rough , tom .
not bad , i' ve been in much worse .

hey , i was employee of the month at the monsoon lagoon .
i knew you were lying .

oh , you did ?
i knew it .
well , you' re the reason that we had to launch the boat in the wrong part of the river .
hey , i am not the navigator map guy .
okay , jerry , didn' t you see on the map that the river split ?
i would' ve , if your friend , the big ass bear , didn' t eat the map .
hold on a sec .
tom ?
were you really employee of the month ?
no .
i lied about that too .
i must have been crazy .
i ...
all right .
this trip is officially over .
this is finished !
let' s ...
let' s just go home .
i agree .
that' s a great decision .
all we gotta do is jump up over that 100 foot waterfall , swim upstream 20 miles , get the sheriff on the phone ...
he liked us , i remember .
and he' il send out a rescue boat .
and ...
hey , there' s a beer in the river .
cool .
look at this , it' s cold .
we are in serious trouble , my friends .
all data points to us being ...
how do you humans say it ?
completely screwed ?
yeah .
you know , that is ...
that' s a good way to say it .
i mean , it pretty much sums it up .
i suspect tom is drunk .
i didn' t wanna say anything ,
because he' s such a live wire ...
you guys , we' re fine .
we got the compass .
i' ve got billy' s compass !
look , that' s east , west , north .

i' m saying i forgot to hold on to it while my ass was free falling over a 100 foot waterfall .
so you don' t have it ?
hey , do you hear that ?
oh , hell , yeah .

i told you not to use my buck knife .
how you like me now , fish ?
you ain' t so tough without a head , huh ?
oh , what' s that ?
you can' t hear me ?
that' s right , because you don' t have ears , because you don' t have a head , because i cut it off !

you set the security flares too close , elwood .
the whole damn field' s on fire .

the next thing you know , i won' t have a license anymore .
they' il take away all my instruments and my coat and my office , and i won' t have a parking space anymore .
i just don' t wanna lose all my stuff .
i lost my legs ...
oh , great .

bullfrogs .

it crawled straight in my stomach .
let' s go .
i think it laid eggs in my stomach .
you think they' re still following us ?
i don' t wanna stop and find out .
just keep going .
it' s not all burnt .
i think we' re gonna be okay .
you think ?
yeah .
you think ?
yeah .
damn it .
it' s all burnt .
i knew it , dennis .
it' s all burnt .
every bit .
they burned it .
oh , yeah .
it' s all burnt .
the whole damn field is burnt .
but we got a bigger problem , elwood !
we got three bona fide yuppies out there ,
lost somewhere , and we gotta track them .
we gotta catch them and we gotta kill them .
i think we can slow down .
i haven' t heard dogs or guns for hours .
yeah ?
you slow down , get a stick of dynamite up your ass .
calm down , daniel , we' re gonna be all right .
no , we' re not , jerry .
we could really die out here .
man , i can' t believe that i would listen to you guys .
let' s go take billy' s trip .
let' s ...
let' s find d. b. ' s treasure .
i' il get a canoe .
i' il get some rope .
is he all right ?
" it' il be great .
" we' il find d. b. ' s treasure ! " right .
is he having a panic attack ?
i don' t know .
that' s great .
make jokes .
that' s a really good idea .
is this living in the moment enough for you , jerry ?
is this the carefree life with no responsibility that you wanted ?
is this the ... ?
is this the great wilderness adventure that you were dreaming of ?
how should i be , dr. dan ?
tell me .
be afraid .
i am afraid .
well , then , act like it !
it is very confusing to people in your life when you don' t act the way that you' re feeling !
no wonder denise is fed up with you .
what did you say ?
don' t you step to me .
put your hands down .
you take it easy .
mr. joe tattoo , mr. motorcycle man , mr. super cool , mr. bullet wound ...
oh , my ...
tom , you got shot .
oh , cool .
he got shot ?
yeah .
come here .
are you all right ?
you could lose a roll of pennies in that thing .
look at how deep it is .
it just grazed you .
you' re really lucky .
oh , wow , that' s gonna be a great scar .
i' m gonna stitch it up good .
lose the cleaver .
meat cleaver' s my favorite .
it' s scary , but ultimately ineffective .
lose it .
now , dennis , you don' t understand ...
them three boys get back to town , you' re gonna spend the next 40 years in the can getting manhandled .
quit messing around .
lose the cleaver .
i love the cleaver .
you' il be good as new .
sorry .
hey , dano .
i' m sorry i got you into this .
i really am .
jerry , i wanted to come .
well , we' re getting out of it .
i promise .
and when we do , someone' s buying the first round .
not it .
not it .
tom , i think you' re buying with all that ...
all that harley money .
oh , god , it' s making me sick .
i' m sorry , i ...
that whole thing was an exaggeration .
what , you don' t make that much ?
no , i don' t sell harleys .
in fact , the only thing i' ve sold lately is some clothes and cds .
they weren' t even mine .
tom , that' s not an exaggeration , that' s a lie .
you know , you lie a lot .
i know .
what happened ?
well , first it was blackjack .
then the cards went south .
so then i started betting football and baseball .
i lost everything .
what' d i expect ?
i got no luck , jerry .
it' s like my old man used to say , " family curse .
if we didn' t have bad luck , we wouldn' t have luck at all .
you have got to stop blaming your old man .
i' m not blaming anyone .
yeah , you are .
listen to yourself .
the family curse .
yeah , it' s real .
i' m a great gambler .
your dad was a piece of work .
i mean , he had his own things going on .
but if he did one thing right , it was not raising a complete idiot .
you' re not him , tommy .
you' re a lot smarter , for one thing .
right , dano ?
well , i wouldn' t say a lot smarter .
tom , you have a lot more going for you than you think you do .
that' s easy for you to say , dano .
you' re a freaking doctor .
i mean , you got a big old bank account , a ginormous house ,
big , thick red hair ...
you know what ?
i wouldn' t be so jealous of me if i were you .
every day i develop some new and exciting phobia .
you' re exaggerating again .
i' m afraid of the dark , jerry .
so ?
there' s a lot of people that are afraid of the dark .
i know a shitload .
i' m afraid of small spaces .
again , not that abnormal .
cellophane .
like saran wrap ?
yeah .
yeah , you' re alone on that one .
see , i won' t even keep it in the house anymore , because i' m afraid somehow it' il get , like , draped over my head and stick to my mouth and nose and i' il ...
i' il suffocate .
how pathetic is that ?
very .
relax , you' re almost through .
there you go .
hey , would one of you guys grab my ... ?
phone .
my ...
that' s a phone .
it' s that way .
phone !
how did your phone get all the way up here ?
who cares ?
that last thing i remember , it was ...
go , go , go !
that bear loves you , dano !
whiskey dick , this is lightning company .
come in , whiskey dick .
we are on the move and loaded for bear .
come back , come back ...
why' d you stop ?
right there .
footprints .
oh , it' s theirs .
it' s weird .
footprints with no people in them .
i mean ... ... it' s like it' s them , but it' s not them , you know what i mean ?
rarely .
get on your wheeler .
hold on a second , guys .
you know what we should do ?
we' re gonna climb the tree .
we' il climb the tree , get a good look at the land , maybe we' il see a road or a way out of here .
yeah , i' il go .
give me a boost .
oh , hey , tom , wait .
you can use these .
thanks .
please , just be careful .
are you maintaining a safe distance back there ?
yeah , two second rule , i know .
do you see anything ?
hey , guys !
this is really cool !
what is he doing up there ?
tommy , you see a road ?
any signs of life ?
are you kidding me ?
tommy ?
tom , do you see anything or not ?
i think i might still be stoned .
hello ?
excuse me , miss ?
ladies ?
my name is flower !
you may call me butterfly .
and if you' re from the logging company , you' il have to speak to our lawyers .
if you look to your left , you can totally see her downstairs .
what ?
we' re not ...
we' re not from the logging company .
peace .
peace .
hey , peace .
peace .
what' s your name ?
jerry .
jerry conlaine .
and what' s your forest name ?
slug .
his forest name is slug .
i got you .
thanks , tom , thanks a lot .
i' m sorry , slug .
we can' t abandon our post .
do you understand ?
well , could we come up there , then ?
please ?
come on up .
so then we run straight into this freezing , like , water pond .
we had to hide underwater , but we used these reeds .
reeds ?
like pussy willow reeds ?
really ?
god , it must' ve been so hard to breathe .
yeah , it' s been quite a trip .
do you guys have a cell phone that we could use ?
sorry , slug .
cell phones are bad for the environment and people who live in the environment .
right .
you poor boys .
you need to get out of those damp , dirty clothes .
here , let us wash them for you .
no , no .
i' m fine .
let us nurture you .
oh , boy !
mighty oak could go for some nurturing .
stay right there .
no .
it' s ...
just relax , condor .
no , it' s okay , honestly .
i' m actually not really into being touched .
i' m a doctor , so i usually do the touching .
yeah .
i' ve been told i give a very good calf massage .
if you wanna roll down those stockings , i could give you one .
stockings ?
leg warmers ?
i' m all natural .
supernatural .
you guys live up here year round ?
we' ve been here 287 beautiful days .
how do you guys get supplies ?
when we need supplies , we radio the earth child support network .
radio ?
you ...
you guys have a radio ?
yeah .
we haven' t used it since that last big thunderstorm .
remember that , flower ?
oh , my god .
that thunderstorm was so spiritual .
earth child' s limbs were just waving , heaving back and forth ,
like she was dancing in the rhythm to the thunder .
it was just like ...
full on tantric orgasm .
so where' s this radio ?
tree had an orgasm ?
you don' t say .
we danced naked in the storm all night .
and then held each other , soaking wet , until the morning .
the rain is like a drug .
it just makes you wanna ...
what ?
makes you wanna what ?
can we please use the radio ?
sure thing , slug .
wow .
monkey feet .
yeah .
it' s like a second pair of hands .
hello ?
anyone out there ?
my name' s jerry conlaine , and my two friends and i are lost in the woods .
hello ?
you gotta say " over . " over .
i read you , son .
this is breaker station 22 .
what is your position ?
over .
see ?
he said , " over .
we are two miles east of harold' s bluff in a giant redwood called earth child .
over .
in a tree .
we' il find you .
we will give assistance and whatnot .
peace .
over .
you just sit tight .
we' re coming to get you .
over and out !
so we ran out of food in borneo , so we just ended up eating our mosquito netting .
just salted it up , and it was good .
it was really good .
oh , you messy thing .
let me get that .
thank you .
well , there' s plenty more grubs here , condor .
oh , no , i couldn' t .
that bark shot right through me .
i need to visit the little trees ' room .
where do you guys do the do ?
top side of the tree .
got a real kick to it .
bag it when you' re done .
put it in the basket up top .
if you bring it in , you take it out .
right ?
okay , will do .
do you have any paper ?
oh , great .
you know ,
i think i' m gonna wait until we get to the ranger station .
someone' s here , someone' s here .
good afternoon , ladies .
nice looking tree .
end of the line , boys .
come on down .
they' re gonna kill earth child .
no !
no , they' re not gonna kill earth child .
they' re after us .
we gotta get down and we gotta make a run for it , all right ?
no !
no !
go to it , elwood .
we' re gonna die up here in this stupid tree .
you know , condor , even if your bodily death is extraordinarily painful ,
your soul will live on .
everything happens for a reason .
listen up , karma chameleons .
nobody' s dying .
here' s the plan .
send those boys down , pretty little birdies .
i' m gonna rappel down .
and then i' m gonna secure the rope and then i' m gonna distract them .
you two slide down after me .
all right ?
okay .
stop it !
cut it down , elwood .
good plan , jerry .
one small change .
time to find out whether i have the family curse or not .
for me , jer , for me ?
yeah , go , go , go .
give them hell , tommy .
this hell mart' s open for business , and i' m slashing prices .
stop !
come on , boys , don' t be afraid .
we gotta cover him .
i have an idea .
you just send those boys down .
there won' t be no more trouble for you , earth mama .
heavier than it looks .
oh , good idea .
oh , yeah .
you' ve got it .
ready ?
you got it .
oh yes .
i' m hit .
i' m hit .
it' s doody , dennis .
one , two , three .
oh , shit .
dano , let' s go .
get away from my tree !
this is wrong .
okay .
i can' t do this , jerry .
okay .
jamming up my gun barrel .
this is not me .
you' re a beautiful spirit .
fly free and know that love follows you .
thank you , kind , crazy , hairy lady of my dreams .
it was cute .
get off my tree !
shoot her .
filthy hippie !
shoot her again .
that is it !
i don' t wanna do this , jerry .
remember when we used to jump off that railroad bridge into cedar lake ?
that was higher than this .
no , no .
i never jumped off of there .
you guys always pushed me when i wasn' t looking .
oh , yeah .
go !
hold on , dan .
i made it .
did i kill your grandma ?
i don' t think so .
where are they getting all this poo ?
he' s getting away on my wheeler !
get him , elwood .
i' m gonna shoot him !
come on , let' s go .
get on , get on .
move , baby , move .
come on , jer .
go .
go .
hold on .
come on , dennis , we gotta move .
all right , i' m on .
go .
go .
hold on , dano .
can' t this thing go any faster ?
shoot the one driving !
what are you doing ?
i' m pretending i' m on a speeder bike so i can block out reality .
it' s my process .
leave me alone .
over there .
it looks like a clearing .
that way .
that way , that way , that way !
damn it , elwood .
i think i just swallowed my underpants .
shoot them .
i can' t believe they survived that fall .
dennis , they' re getting away .
no , they' re trapped like rats .
only way they can go now is up the mountain .
we know right where they' re headed .
let' s go .
flat tire .
damn it , tom .
keep moving .
getting close , elwood .
this way .
all right , that is it .
i' m out .
i' m out .
i' m out .
i have spent the last , like , two hours within sniffing distance of a sweaty ball sack and a sweaty ball sack , and i am out .
i' m out .
what does that mean ?
i think it means he' s out .
like , coming out .
like , he' s finally admitted he' s gay .
you know , i' m just gonna stay here until help comes .
i mean , this is serious .
i lost my inhaler .
i' ve known you almost , what , 25 years now ?
i' ve never seen you have even a hint of asthma , anything .
that' s because i have the inhaler , jerry .
no , i think jerry' s right .
i think this whole thing' s just in your head .
you just need to take a couple of real deep breaths and you' il get over it .
oh , okay , why didn' t i think of that ?
i' il just get over my chronic respiratory illness .
i' il just breathe .
there you go .
i' m over it .
see ?
that wasn' t that hard , was it ?
you gotta relax , dano .
all right ?
it' s no time to give up hope .
let' s just keep going .
no , actually , jerry , i' m convinced that this is the perfect time to give up hope .
i don' t know that there has ever been a better time to give up hope .
i mean , look at this .
things are as bad as they could possibly get .
i stand corrected .
elwood , what are you doing ?
it' s raining .
it' s raining .
tom , man , get under here .
you' re gonna die of pneumonia .
no , but we will die of hypothermia .
look , our only chance is to huddle together .
we gotta huddle our bodies together for warmth .
i , for one , choose death .
interesting .
one minute you mock my sweaty ball sack , and now you wanna cuddle with it .
you know , the whole huddle up thing is the oldest trick in the book .
i' ve used it .
it' s just for getting a girl naked .
worked , though .
every time .
this never leaves the cave .
i' m starting to feel warm .
see ?
i told you guys .
let' s just try and get some sleep .
hey , dano .
how hot were those chicks in the tree ?
they were hairy , but hot .
the rain , dancing to the rhythm of the thunder , full on tantric orgasm , are you kidding me ?
hey , didn' t ... ?
didn' t she kiss you once ?
it was nice .
oh , my god .
they are probably dancing naked right now .
dancing ...
soaking wet .
hey .
hey !
oh , my god , dano , how could you ? !
it wasn' t me , it was jerry .
jerry , why would you do that ?
i' m sorry .
my bad .
i' m so sorry .
what happens in the cave , stays in the cave .
oh , my god .
that was your ...
come back to bed , you guys .
i' m freezing .
not till he puts jabba back in his hut .
freeze , perverts .
wait , wait , wait , just ...
please don' t shoot us , okay ?
this isn' t what it looks like .
if you' re gonna rape somebody , rape dano .
did i ask you to talk ?
no .
come with me , or i' il shoot your testicles off and stuff them and mount them on my mantelpiece .
that' s gonna be an ugly mantelpiece .
go on .
that' s it , come on .
what is it ?
cinnamon .
what the hell are you doing , collecting herbs for your goddamn herb garden ?
well , all the twigs are broken .
they' ve been through here .
that they have .
nice place .
get along .
build this yourself ?
open the door .
okay , i' m going .
that' s it .
it' s a lot warmer in here .
i think he' s gonna try to cook us .
where you going ?
oh , susanna
don' t you cry for me
if you' re gonna kill us , just do it already , okay ?
i am sick of waiting to die .
okay .
was that reckless ?
yes .
if i was gonna kill you , i would have done it outside .
thank you .
thank you .
i agree .
you' re a very gracious man .
that' s a good one .
yes , with a happy ending .
d. b.
what' d you call me ?
d. b. the maps ...
you are , aren' t you ?
you' re d. b. cooper .
no , i ain' t d. b. cooper .
that' s ancient history .
i tell you what' s not ancient history , though .
it' s three naked deviates on my mountain .
we were searching for d. b. and , yes , we' re naked , and we' re trespassing , but there' s a perfectly good explanation .
first thing , i want you to put some clothes on .
and then i' d like to hear this story .
thank you .
oh , thank you .
more of your own homemade fashions ?
i wouldn' t mind wearing one of these deer pelts up there .
i' d get dressed faster if i was you because i' ve been alone in this cabin for 30 years .
oh , god .
okay .
they would' ve come in here to escape the rain .
they laid down right here , dennis .
right here .
lay down beside me .
in order to stalk your prey , you gotta go where they go and do what they do .
then a scuffle broke out , and there were some harsh words exchanged , and they beat that little one until he was limp .
elwood ,
i don' t need to know what happened .
i just need to know which way they went .
up mountain .
all right , let' s get back to the wheeler .
i know a shortcut around devil' s staircase .
we can still beat them to the summit .
and then you , you scared us with your testicle mounting speech .
that just came right off the top of my head .
it was very scary .
it was creepy too .
may i ask you one question ?
could you really see their downstairs ?
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
you could see everything .
it was ...
it was quite a view .
so , del , were you d. b. ' s partner ?
and his best friend too .
we' ve known each other ever since we were able to pee straight .
so ...
is he still alive ?
hell , i don' t know .
d. b. had this plan , see .
when he jumped out of the airplane , he was gonna land 3 degrees northwest of red devil ridge .
and he had a flashlight .
he was gonna signal me ,
i' d find him and then we were gonna work our way down to rio .
i love rio .
what ... ?
what happened ?
it snowed .
a blizzard .
you couldn' t see anything .
you couldn' t see your hand in front of your face .
hell , i don' t know where he landed .
i looked for him for months and months .
so did the fbl , so did the cops .
no d. b. , no money .
but you could' ve left .
why' d you stay up here all these years ?
seemed like a good idea at the time .
you know what i mean , kid ?
yeah ,
i do .
have you ever spent 30 years in a cabin ?
no .
then you don' t know what i mean .
i mean , metaphorically , i know what you mean .
metaphorically , have you ever spent 30 years in a cabin ?
ye ...
no .
well , then , think before you talk .
point is , i' ve spent the best years of my life sitting on the porch , playing the harmonica , waiting for something better , and the years have been going by faster and faster .
and then all of a sudden ,
i was an old man .
well , i bet you can play the shit out of that harmonica .
that i can .
except there' s no one around to hear me play it .
you can lose your money , you can spend all of it , and if you work hard , you get it all back .
but if you waste your time , you' re never gonna get it back .
whatever it is you fellas are looking for , you gotta go out and get it .
and you gotta go right now .
not right now , you idiots .
well , you boys get some sleep .
in the morning , i' m gonna point you in the right direction , get you right off this mountain .
morning .
bacon .
squirrel .
squirrel .

creeping me out .
look at this .
does a bear shit in the woods ?
hey .
does a bear shit in the woods ?
my cell phone .
where did you find that ?
does a bear shit in the woods ?
usually .
unbelievable .
i gotta make a quick call , all right ?
who you gonna call ?
ghostbusters ?
denise .
hi .
jerry and denise are no longer doing it .
if you need denise , call her on her cell .
it' s killing time !
come on , jerry , get down .
hey , come on , now .
give me a hand .
every time i get comfortable .
listen up .
go due north till you get to the top of the ridge , then you go directly west .
okay .
just keep going , you' il come to an old mining trail .
follow that right down to the bottom of the mountain .
all right .
you go right , i go left .
okay .
i love this part .
come on , he say left or right ?
have a good life , boys .
let' s go .
go , go , go !
when you peckerwoods get your diapers clean , come on back .
i' il be waiting .
west is this way .
we' re not going west .
yes , we are .
the compass says so .
the compass came out of a cereal box , so why are we running the wrong way ?
iron .
iron .
what ?
iron ore .
there' s iron in the hills .
it' s throwing off the magnet .
tell mr. wizard that we' re still going the wrong way .
which means del' s compass , it wouldn' t work here .
if d. b. was supposed to land 3 degrees northwest of devil' s ridge , it would' ve come off as directly west .
who cares about d. b.
which means he would' ve landed somewhere ...
oh , my throat , neck , chest .
guys , i think we found him .
jesus .
this is him .
this is d. b. cooper .
it has to be .
the parachute and the briefcase .
he must have broke his legs in the landing and then stumbled in this hole .
you poor bastard .
del was looking for him , but it was winter .
and the snow must have covered up the top there .
we found him .
that' s him .
i can' t believe we did it .
d. b. cooper .
who else would it be ?
this case is empty .
the money' s gone .
no , look .
look what he' s holding .
he burnt the cash to stay warm .
he traded every dollar for just a few more hours of life .
so much for the treasure .
no , that' s it .
being alive , that' s the treasure .
here he is , boys , the great d. b. cooper and his treasure .
and we found it , so we get our most valuable possessions back .
yeah .
gentlemen .
time to leave this stuff behind and get the hell home .
come on , elwood .
well , boss .
what' s the plan now ?
first we gotta find our way out of this hellhole ,
and then we make a run for it .
no .
no more running .
after everything we' ve been through ,
dr. mott has finally run out of things to be afraid of .
do you hear that ?
i' m not scared of you , you neanderthal dicks !
okay , okay .
we got it , we got it , all right ?
hey , look , there' s light coming from over there .
what is that , a tunnel ?
maybe it leads out of here .
we' re never getting through there ... ... tom .
dano ?
no .
no .
no way .
what happened to the badass over there ?
what happened to running out of things to be afraid of ?
that was ...
this is just a small , dark space .
i can' t , i can' t , it' s a deal breaker .
this could lead out of here .
dan , you' re the only one small enough to go through .
that' s what she said .
it' s ...
it' s a mine shaft .
they had to get the ore out somehow .
it' s our only chance , dano .
come on , prairie dog .
you can do it .
i don' t think that' s helping .
okay .
come on .
let' s get him like this and slide him in .
keep going , buddy .
keep going .
there' s gotta be light .
do you see light ?
i don' t think i can .
i don' t think i can .
come on , dan .
soothing songs from the past .
do you really wanna hurt me ?
do you really wanna make me cry ?
precious kisses , words that burn me
lovers never ask you why
do you really wanna hurt me ?
come on , dano !
do you really wanna make me cry ?

precious kisses , words that burn me
lovers never ask you why
the hills have gone gay .

i had a new wave phase .
precious kisses , words that love me
lovers never ask you why
do you really wanna hurt me ?

do you really want to make me cry ?
yes , we really wanna hurt you
yes , we really wanna make you cry
precious kisses , words that burn me

these boys have been running all over .
well , it' s a damn good thing i got here .

nice racket , sheriff .
what , do you get a cut of the weed profits ?
profits ?
they work for me , ass wipe .
what are you gonna tell our families ?
you can' t exactly explain this away .
explaining ?
we don' t have to explain anything .
it' s just three more city boys got lost on the river , that' s all .
hey , i bet they got eaten up by scavengers .
it' s a terrible shame .
dano .
case closed .
let' s shoot them .
i wanna shoot the little redhead one right there .

look , you and i , we' re cut from the same cloth .
i mean , we' re a lot alike , don' t you think ?
yeah , sure , i' m better with numbers and i bathe often .
i have a dental plan that allows me to keep all my teeth , unlike yourself .
yeah ?
i learned a little something the last couple days , getting chased by ass face and dick chin there .
and that is ...
i have two of the best friends anyone could ever ask for .
i' ve got the love of a good woman .
i' ve got a really good life .
i mean , i' ve got an amazing life .
and i' ve decided that my life' s worth living .
now , you have to decide if your life' s worth living too , because if it is , you put your gun down .
and if we don' t ?
bye , bye , boys .
it' s go time .
do this to him .
put the pin back in the grenade .
that is my grenade , sir .
the plan was for me to sacrifice myself if need be while you two ran for it .
i didn' t know .
my grenade ...
i' m not a mind reader , jerry .
give me back my grenade .
run !
it' s gonna blow !
all right , that' s it .
you' re dead .
when all this is over , someone' s buying the first round .
not it .
not it .
enough of this shit .
just shoot them .
do you think there' s beer in heaven ?
i was thinking about the bar in town .
let' s get off this mountain .
all right .
these charges are " unsubstantuated " and " injustifigurable " and ...
that' s right .
we did it .
how you like me now ?
this is the scene here at police headquarters as three local heroes emerge to a cheering crowd .
the men accidentally helped break up one of the biggest drug rings in state history while hiking in a remote section of the cascades .
my old man would not believe this .
billy wouldn' t believe it .
actually , know what ?
i think he would .
oh , my goodness .
look at this ensemble .
i like it .
look at you .
thank you , boys .
look at this stud .
del !
no names .
fuzz .
glad i caught you guys before you headed out .
i got something for you .
what' s this ?
d. b. ' s parachute .
are you sure ?
damn sure .
there' s a little something for you rolled up inside there too .
thank you .
so where you headed ?
thought i' d see the world .
i might even hit washington .
wow .
one state over .
till i do , i' m just telling tall tales .
remember , carry your friends wherever you go .
close to your heart .
or on your back .
i got d. b. ' s bones in my satchel .
thought i' d give him a proper burial .
i spent 30 years waiting to have a life .
what the hell ... ?
oh , my gosh .
oh , my god .
d. b. didn' t burn it all .
he couldn' t .
it was del' s share .
there' s gotta be 100 grand in here .
we' il split it three ways .
one third , one third , one third ?
you know what ?
no , thanks .
i' m ...
i' m good .
i' m not good .
you guys split it .
you wanna split it ?
fifty fifty ?
actually , i can' t .
because i bet you 100 grand that you couldn' t catch a salmon with a flashlight and i lost .
besides , tom , you got bills to pay .
you got a new life to start .
i don' t know what to say .
just say we' re square .
no , actually , we' re not square .
i seem to recall a certain part of that wager being one left nut , and i' m gonna get it .
come on , pleated pants , let' s go .
hey , tom .
hey .
hey .
oh , no .
don' t make me go in through the throat .
i' m going through the throat .
you said i could keep it .
no , i didn' t .
tom , you said i could keep it .
jerry !
officer !
hi .
this is jerry , and i can' t come to the phone right now , because i am busy trying to convince the love of my life to give me another chance .
and i will prove to her that i grew up just enough to know that i want the responsibility , day in and day out , of being there for her in this relationship , which i am hoping will someday become marriage and kids and a long and unbelievably happy life together .
hi , honey .
so happy right now .
that was really , really beautiful .
will you get the light , hon ?
oh , yeah .
you' re so good at that now .
and then i jumped on the grenade to save my buddies and ...
blew my rib cage all to shit .
sent me 156 feet in the air .
then i went back and paid off all my debts in full with d. b. ' s money .
one question .
what' s a downstairs ?
