it' s always a pleasure , mr. charles .
here' s another of those " call long island operator number 15 .
don' t you think you ought to call ?
certainly not .
she knows better than that .
i told her i was bringing the wife along this time .
why do i always take it for granted that you' re kidding ?
hello , darling .
we just got in a little while ago .
will you bring up a passkey for that connecting door ?
yes , ma' am .
thank you .
we had a lovely trip .
nick was sober in kansas city .
that' s a very bitter woman .
tonight ?
we' d love to .
i haven' t been to a night club in ...
hello ?
i' m sorry , it' s long island again and they insist on cutting in .
yes , i' il tell her .
go ahead , long island .
hello , nora ?
this is col. macfay .
don' t you ever pay any attention to your messages ?
well , how are you ?
how is the famous detective ?
quit , has he ?
i should have thought ... with all the publicity he got over the last two cases .
i see .
listen , young lady , i' ve sent my car in for you .
the weekend ?
i don' t think ...
we just got off a train .
and there' s the baby , you know .
i' m afraid ...
it' s a trap .
he just wants to get me there to go over that yearly statement .
it isn' t about business , is it , col. macfay ?
i told you .
can' t it wait till you come to town ?
no , i' m not coming to town .
i' m just staying close to the house for a while .
you' ve got to come to me this time .
well , that' s not much to ask .
very well , we' il come .
after all , we' ve never been down there .
it' il be nice in the country .
a quiet weekend .
good air for the baby .
i think they have a pool .
i' il see a lot of that pool .
i' il be up to my ears ... in financial statements , business , forecasts .
you have to do it sometime .
he can' t do anything without you .
mommy , you shouldn' t try to figure out a highly technical problem like that .
you' il strain yourself .
you see ?
seems like man' s work is never done .
come in .
beg your pardon , ma' am .
i' m col. macfay' s chauffeur .
yes .
i thought i might help with your luggage .
as you wish .
come in .
i' m from miss sherwood' s agency .
yes .
miss ...
dorothy waters .
these are my references .
miss sherwood spoke to you about salary ?
yes , mrs. charles .
if you' il excuse me for saying so , mrs. charles ... it takes nearly two hours to get out to col. macfay' s .
it does ?
it' s getting rather late .
we ought to hurry .
yes .
we have to go to long island , so i' il phone the agency later .
no , indeed .
the baby' s awake now , mrs. charles .
i don' t wonder ...
oh , dear .
come in .
are you the party that wanted the passkey ?
party ?
i' m more like a riot .
the bedroom , the connecting door .
sorry , ma' am .
we' il have to hurry .
shall i take the baby ?
or shall i ?
boy , this is going to be a cinch .
heaven help honest folk in a hotel like this .
nick .
well , i' m a monkey' s uncle .
i didn' t know this was your apartment .
hiya , creeps .
i' m glad to see you , nick .
yeah ?
even if it did cost me one of the prettiest jobs i ever lined up for myself .
i' ve been trying to get my hands on those keys for two weeks .
well , that' s that .
how' ve you been ?
nickie , we must hurry .
how are you , mrs. charles ?
i didn' t recognize you .
how are you ?
i' m fine .
mommy , this is creeps binder .
remember ?
creeps ?
creeps .
you remember .
nick sent me up the river .
it' s nice you don' t feel bad about it .
why should i ?
it took a genius to outsmart me .
you wanna touch me ?
you shouldn' t run him down like that .
no , mrs. charles .
nickie' s doing something .
well , i guess i won' t need this anymore .
do you mind ?
no .
make yourself at home .
what' s the matter ?
what have you got ?
asta' s bone .
you shouldn' t leave it around .
you' re older , you ought to know better .
a baby .
yeah .
is it yours ?
yes .
what do you know .
is it a boy ?
certainly .
what is it there ?
say hello to mr. binder .
can he talk ?
a few words .
i ought to rate one of them .
how about it ?
come on , see .
what' s the matter ?
i was just trying to think who he looks like .
anyone i know ?
i got it .
it' s the missus .
why didn' t you tell me you had a kid ?
well , you know .
you don' t have to feel that way about him .
he' s all right .
you should see some of the monkeys i' ve seen .
and the fathers are taking bows .
feel better now , mommy ?
how old is he ?
he' il be a year next monday .
monday ?
we' il throw him a party .
i' il get the mob to bring their kids .
what do you say ?
we have to go to the country .
yes .
we don' t quite know how long .
it' s a date then .
i' il get my brother to let me bring his kids over .
he' s got two of the cutest little tricks .
that' s very kind .
leave it to creepsie , mrs. charles .
i' il throw you a baby party you' ve never seen the like of .
your father has such lovely friends .
that' s all right .
think nothing of it .
glad to do it .
how much further is it ?
the house is a little way up the hill .
it' s about a mile around to the gates .
stop the car .
we' d better not , mr. charles .
stop the car , i tell you .
all right , you take it .
what happened ?
you wouldn' t believe me if i told you .
come back here , asta .
what are you hunting for ?
i thought i knew , but now i' il take anything i can find .
what is it ?
not a thing .
i wish you' d tell me what it' s all about .
what happened to the chauffeur ?
he was scared .
now i am .
scared of what ?
i don' t see anything .
there isn' t anything .
that' s what i' m scared of .
let' s go back to new york .
we can' t .
col. macfay' s expecting us .
let' s go someplace and get a drink and think it over .
the nearest drink is macfay' s .
mommy , you' re a stubborn woman .
would you mind opening the gates ?
what do you want ?
we' re bringing back col. macfay' s car .
i see that all right , but how do i know what you want ?
this is the charles family .
nick charles and family .
anyone can say that .
and suppose you say it to col. macfay .
there' s a party down here , he says his name is charles .
he looks to me like a pool parlor dude .
okay , if you say so .
all right , go ahead .
thank you .
hey , there .
just a minute .
it' s all right .
we' ve been announced .
those are my feet .
what' s the idea of the kid ?
we have a dog and he was lonesome .
that was the idea , wasn' t it , mommy ?
what is all this about ?
you' il find out .
i' il go with you to see that you arrive safe .
come in .
make yourself useful for once and bring in the bags .
i' m mrs. bellam , the housekeeper .
we' re sorry , we' re late , but we lost your chauffeur .
bless your heart .
that' s quite all right .
think no more about it .
come this way .
but all these guards and everything .
is the colonel all right ?
bless you , yes .
he' s waiting dinner .
you needn' t hurry .
if you' il just follow me .
i won' t have it .
i' m not a child .
i won' t put up with it .
what' s the use of saying we won' t , when we are ?
it' s a lot of april foolery .
you call it what you like .
i' ve seen what i' ve seen .
it was the cuban .
i don' t think you need to worry anymore .
the two men had a falling out .
one of them killed the other .
the other ?
i' m the one that doesn' t want to be killed .
father dear , freddie means that he ...
jesse , down .
at last .
how are you , colonel ?
how are you , my dear ?
glad to see you .
wasn' t there a body in the road ?
he don' t believe me .
oh , yes .
you see ?
a body ?
yes .
it was gone when i went back .
just a trick .
it' s all part of their game , their plan to terrify me .
go on .
everybody brings these wild stories to me , but nobody tries to help .
what is it , colonel ?
nothing wrong with nora' s estate ?
estate ?
is that all you' re worried about ?
doesn' t anybody care about me ?
father , why don' t you have dinner first ?
then you can tell them all about it afterwards .
none of us has even met mr. and mrs. charles yet .
my adopted daughter , lois .
it seems awful we' ve never met before .
yes , doesn' t it ?
and i' d like you to meet my ...
mr. dudley horn .
how do you do ?
this is mr. coleman , father' s secretary .
how do you do ?
how do you do , sir ?
jesse , down !
down , jesse !
charmed , i' m sure .
take this dog out where it belongs .
where are your manners ?
come on .
thorough nuisance .
it wasn' t his fault .
nick smells like a dog .
i mean , he smells like asta .
now , are you ready for dinner ?
yes , i would like a ...
that' s all right .
never mind about washing .
freddie , lock up that liquor cabinet .
but maybe they would like a ...
mrs. charles doesn' t drink and i want mr. charles to have a clear mind .
where are the others ?
i never knew such a lot .
as if i' ve not got enough to worry me over .
here you are , sir .
tell them to serve dinner .
i want to have a talk with you .
i want to get you working on this .
nora' s estate .
this is business , nora' s business , your business .
what' il happen to the estate if something happened to me ?
nothing' s going to happen to you .
everything' s going to be all right .
you go on in .
i' il send the baby upstairs .
i' il take care of nick .
don' t be long .
put the lights out .
no use wasting money .
getting me on another case ?
that penny pincher can afford the best detective there is .
he' s trying to get one for nothing .
you' re abetting him .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
then what was all that business at the door ?
i was just picking his pocket .
i haven' t been married to you for nothing .
mommy .
suppose you had someone working for you ... and he did something they put him in jail for ?
he did it .
you didn' t do it .
you even try to get his sentence cut down .
but you couldn' t .
when he gets out , he comes and says it' s your fault .
your fault ?
he wants a lot of money .
when you won' t give it to him , he hopes you won' t be pigheaded .
because he dreamed twice about your dying .
the third time he dreams things , they come true .
what do you think ?
i wouldn' t hurry up my dying on his account .
was this the man playing dead beside the road ?
no , it' s his servant .
the two of them have terrorized this place .
have you reported them to the police ?
i' m not altogether a fool .
of course , i have .
they can' t arrest a man just because he told you his dreams .
he tells me he' s dreaming about me dying .
i know church well enough to know that' s a threat .
church ?
phil church , an engineer .
worked for me 10 years ago .
and he' s been in jail ever since ?
yes .
yes .
he got out a month ago .
been living down the road for 10 days .
you think he really means to kill you ?
no .
i don' t think he means to kill me .
i know it .
please , father .
he' s only trying to get it straight in his mind .
there' s nothing to get straight .
the man means to kill me , i' m asking mr. charles not to let him do it .
that' s simple enough , isn' t it ?
even for mr. charles .
no .
col. macfay ?
the swimming pool' s on fire .
what ?
nickie .
stay where you are !
one move out of you and i' il blow your head right off your neck .
kill him if he even bats an eye .
tom , take that gun out of mr. charles ' face and stop bellowing .
awfully glad to see you , mr. horn .
ain' t the right guy .
what is it ?
it' s the dog .
jesse ?
yep .
dead ?
yes .
his throat' s cut .
he was a swell dog .
this is gonna be tough on lois .
find anything ?
only them .
they don' t look like nothing , don' t lead nowhere .
they' re footprints , all right .
our man had rags wrapped around his feet .
you know a lot about them things , mister ?
yes .
back home i' m a boy scout .
what' s happened , dudley ?
what is it ?
it' s jesse .
he' s been killed .
no .
you' d better go back to the house .
why did they do an awful thing like that ?
freddie , take her back .
is this the kind of thing that' s been going on ?
more or less .
some of it' s silly , but it' s nasty , too .
what do you think is behind these tricks ?
what' s he up to ?
trying to scare the colonel into coming across with some money .
could any of the people on the inside be working with him ?
i don' t think so .
servants aren' t much good but i imagine they' re honest .
does macfay really owe him anything ?
not the way we look at it .
you see ... his job was to get results ... without bothering the colonel with too many details .
we were trying to put over ...
well , call it a public utilities enterprise ... and some details were pretty illegal , were traced as far church .
but not as far as the colonel .
right .
in other words , if everything goes okay , he gets the profits .
lf not , church goes to jail .
that' s about it .
and that' s your job with the colonel now ?
something like that .
how could they do a horrible thing like that ?
i' ve had him ever since he was puppy .
how do they get in here ?
that' s what i want to know .
how do they get in ?
well ?
i' m afraid the bathhouse is badly damaged .
i don' t care about bathhouses or dogs .
what are you going to do to protect me ?
if they can get in here to do this , they can do anything .
you' ve got to help me , charles .
have you tried talking to church ?
yes , didn' t do any good .
i used to work under him .
he thinks i had a hand in sending him up .
how about making a bargain with him ?
after all , he did do 10 years in jail .
i won' t pay him a penny .
he can burn the house down before i pay him a cent .
maybe he' s right , father .
maybe it would be better if you ...
i thank you to keep out of it .
when i want your opinion , i' il ask for it .
don' t you dare talk to her that way .
you should be thankful she cares whether you live or die .
you little ...
you can' t bulldoze me any longer .
i don' t care how much money you have .
that may interest dudley .
but it doesn' t mean a thing to me .
look here , freddie .
i know you have a crush on lois but don' t make any cracks like that .
dudley .
what' s this ?
what if i am in love with her ?
that' s nobody' s business but my own .
if you cared , you wouldn' t let him talk to her that way .
why , she' s too good for you .
and for you , too .
and you needn' t bother to fire me .
i' m going .
is this true ?
has that whippersnapper been making up to you ?
no , of course not .
he' s never said anything that ...
and you , dudley .
you ought to be ashamed of yourself .
all right , desert me .
all of you .
go on , you , too .
why don' t you go ?
col. macfay , it' s just the baby ...
take your precious baby and go .
but , understand , this is the end .
there' s the mining company reports , the lumber company , and the railway .
there you are .
you take them on from now on .
you manage them .
i' m through .
how do you like your quiet weekend ?
production of lumbers , seasonally adjusted .
good heavens , do you understand that ?
sure .
that' s ...
that' s " the indirect ratio between the sales depreciation ...
and the unrealized inventory losses .
understand ?
yes .
but " naturally ...
an allowance has to be made for the major cyclical downswing .
you get that , of course .
naturally .
do you ?
of course , " you have to have a fair degree of accuracy ...
by reference to a straight line correlation formula .
don' t you think you' d better go and see church ?
mommy , i' m going .
hey , asta , come here .
that' s not that kind of a cat .
what are you sticking your pretty nose in here for , chum ?
sorry , the door was open .
all right , you made your joke .
now , pull your freight .
get going .
just as you say , chief .
good evening , sir .
how do ?
mr. church expecting you .
you' re going to catch a cold , lying in damp roads on dark nights .
no , sir , i dress warm in this country .
i' m phil church .
how do you do ?
sit down .
thank you .
this is smitty .
we can talk in front of her .
how do you do ?
have a drink ?
yes .
dum dum .
sit down .
go on with your packing , honey .
you bet .
going away ?
yeah , back to cuba .
it' d be nice if you' d give us all the gory details first , though .
gory details ?
yes .
you mean , the dead dog , and the burning bathhouse ?
no , afterwards .
nothing happened afterwards .
but i dreamed ...
look , you' re not tricking me , are you ?
no .
you give me your word that nothing happened .
my word .
he' s nuts .
if you listen to him , he' il have you nuts , too .
you can laugh if you want to .
but i don' t laugh at my dreams .
listen ...
i came all the way back from cuba after the second one ... to try to make the colonel see reason , before it was too late .
because the third one' s the end on my schedule .
this afternoon i had the third dream .
how does he usually die in these dreams ?
he' s all battered up .
his throat cut .
it' s all kind of messy .
just the sort of death you' d expect that slob to have .
it' d be funny if it happened that way , wouldn' t it ?
no , it' s funnier that it didn' t .
hey , look .
are you sure he' s all right ?
how long ago did you leave him ?
half an hour .
it must have happened after you left .
that' s the end of him as a possible gold mine .
now , we got to think about you .
me ?
yes .
why pick on me ?
i can introduce you to a lot of rich people .
don' t kid me , charles .
your father in law was macfay' s partner back in the days when my foot slipped .
if my father in law had anything to do with this ...
i' il give you a check right now .
but i want proof .
there' s always the catch in it .
proof .
nobody but me was putting anything on paper in those days , charles .
that' s why nobody but me went over .
i knew you were going to be tough to deal with .
and i can' t honestly say that i' ve ever dreamed about you ... or about your wife ... or about your baby ... yet .
stop it , dum dum !
men are such rowdies .
that' s to remind you not to dream about my family .
call a cab .
we' il catch the 9 : 00 train .
still headed for cuba ?
still cuba .
but i' il be back .
i think as time goes on ... you' il see your way clear to doing business with me .
you mean , continue to do business with you .
come along , asta .
he doesn' t want to play anymore .
thanks for not shooting me .
that would' ve only made things worse .
there you are .
three for new york .
now , what' il you have ?
yes , just this minute .
want me to stop them ?
no , that' s fine , thanks .
they' ve left .
thank heaven .
that' s more like it .
i knew you' d scare him off .
i wouldn' t be too sure it' s over .
what do you mean ?
my guess is whatever he meant to do in the first place , he still means to do .
if i were you , colonel , i' d move to new york .
i' m going to stay right here .
remember , though , that if you stay here , you' re very apt to stay here .
nonsense .
the moment he knew you were here , he lit out .
that' s all there is .
i hope you' re right .
but his talk with me didn' t sound like it .
he wants to include nora and me in this shakedown ... on the grounds that her father was your partner .
was he in on this mess ?
because if he was , i want to settle with church .
sure , give him anything he wants .
a few thousands here and there .
what does it matter ?
it all grows on trees .
that isn' t answering my question .
run along , all of you .
run along .
good night , sir .
good night , father .
sleep well .
my father wasn' t in this if there was anything wrong .
my father was just as honest as yours .
some day you' il find what a hot recommendation that is .
you knew nora' s father , charles .
do you think he was a crook ?
no .
do you think i' m a crook ?
no .
for the sake of argument , can you pretend you think i am ?
i can do that all right .
i thought you might .
nora' s father knew more about lumber and mines ... than any man in this country .
but he didn' t know the first word about finance .
i did .
so , if i' m a crook and nora' s father' s an honest man ... why should i give him a share of any crooked deal i put over ?
i don' t get it , but i know you' ve said something nice .
thank you .
come on , you big flatfoot .
good night , colonel .
good night .
and don' t let me hear anymore about paying church .
i' ve slaved for that money of yours ... and i feel about it just as if it were my own .
his own ?
you' re suspicious of everything .
i' d hate to wake up some morning ... and find the fortune i' d married you for is gone .
stop talking that way .
of course , i can always earn a good living as a detective .
but what worries me is what are you and nickie going to live on ?
you needn' t wait up any longer , dorothy .
thank you , madam .
good night .
good night , sir .
she wouldn' t be a bad looker if she took her specs off .
i' il speak to her .
don' t get her hopes up .
nickie in there ?
no , i' m keeping him in here tonight .
in here ?
yes , i wanted to be sure he was safe .
where is he ?
in the bureau drawer .
in the bureau ?
well , that' s fair enough .
he loves it , he went right to sleep .
i hope it doesn' t get to be a habit .
it' il be a little inconvenient when he grows up .
hey , you didn' t put my things underneath there ?
no , they' re in that chest .
i may be a little prejudiced , but i think he' s all right .
asta , just a minute .
there you are .
my , it' s stuffy in here .
open the windows , dum dum .
what time is it ?
five minutes to 11 : 00 .
you' ve got to go right away , don' t you ?
i' ve got a few minutes .
i hate these schemes where all the pieces have to fit together .
too many things can go wrong .
we can' t miss .
i wish you' d dream up some way to get that nick charles out of there .
i don' t trust him .
he looks like a guy with insomnia to me .
i don' t like him around , but i don' t see how he can gum our game .
it was airtight without him , it' il be airtight with him .
don' t let this goog bother you .
plenty of winners have had them .
hello , smitty .
busy ?
no .
no , never too busy to see a friend .
come on in .
what do you know ?
nothing much .
why , hello , church .
hiya , diamond back .
come on in , sit down .
i only got a minute .
a guy came in from up the river this morning ... with a line from your husband .
what is it ?
what did tip say ?
do you mind ?
no .
well , what' s tip up to now ?
still kicking about wanting a larger cell ?
he' s been thinking again .
he sent down a lot of orders for material and stuff ...
with the warden' s name forged on them .
let' s see .
he wants you to make a deal with someone ... who can pass himself off as the warden' s go between ...
and collect the rake off .
nothing can stop that boy .
he' s a smart little guy .
too smart .
seven years i' ve been married to him and ... he' s so slick he hasn' t been out of the can to finish our honeymoon .
don' t seem to be breaking your heart .
you spend a lot of time with this guy , church , don' t you ?
now don' t start that again .
he' s just a friend , like i told you .
any guy can get to be too good a friend , like i told you .
when' s he going to cuba ?
how did you know he was going ?
i get around .
he' s going tomorrow .
good .
hope nothing happens to upset his plans .
be seeing you .
some day i' m going to skin a knuckle on that four eyed gent .
you' d better catch him without the cheaters on .
he' s plenty good as long as he can see .
yeah ?
11 : 00 , time to go .
adis .
good luck .
wish me luck .
say , i thought this was strictly business .
you know , i could go for you .
don' t give me that .
i' ve been fooled too many times .
you love me , don' t you ?
what if i do ?
i' m only in this for the coin .
we' il have plenty of coin from now on , baby .
we ?
you and me .
what do you say ?
want to play for keeps ?
okay .
maybe i ought to know a little more about the ins and outs of what you' re doing .
what' s the matter ?
losing confidence in me since i stopped that punch ?
i haven' t got that much sense .
time for you to make that telephone call .
goodbye , honey .
i' il keep my fingers crossed for you .
hello , this is mrs. h. culverton smith .
i' d like to speak to ...
i would like to speak ...
you wanna play .
all right , if you promise to go back to sleep .
there .
you wanna play with him ?
no , he' s asleep .
all right , you can play with him , but promise not to wake him .
no , it' s all right .
it won' t come off .
pull it , you' il see .
work hard , honey .
maybe you can get it out .
it' s all right , darling .
it' s just the baby .
he' s getting so big .
we' re going to have to make up our minds who' s going to tell him .
tell him what ?
about life .
life .
who' s life ?
now , nickie , this is important .
this is your responsibility .
if he were a girl , that would be different , then i' d do it .
but you know more about boys than i do , so you ought to tell him .
all right .
where is he ?
not now .
i mean , when he' s about 14 .
here , you hold him .
how nice .
i heard you talking and wondered if anything was wrong .
we were playing with the baby .
i' m sorry we woke you .

hello , sweetheart .

he' s still running on california time .

i' d better tell lois .

yes .

attention all cars .
phil church , age 37 , height 5' 11 " ... weight 185 pounds , eyes brown ... hair dark , gray at the temples .
last seen wearing a light gray suit .
photograph every inch of that sill .
what have we got , doc ?
bruise on left temple , blunt instrument .
throat cut with fairly large heavy blade .
death instantaneous .
right wrist broken .
been dead about half an hour .
that check with the time they found him ?
check .
ought to be enough to go on .
i' il go into things more thoroughly tomorrow .
thanks , doc .
he says that cuban threw a big knife at him .
might be the same one .
it' il have the marks of his dog' s teeth on the handle .
get the some of boys busy in the bushes to look for it .
yes , sir .
come on , jim .
he must' ve gone out the front door .
he ?
who ?
church , or the cuban .
how do you know ?
i don' t know .
i just seen the front door open when i went down the cellar .
what was you doing in the cellar ?
i went down to fix the fuse .
what fuse ?
the fuse that was blowed out .
how did you know it was blowed out ?
i don' t know nothing .
i was just doing what mrs. bellam told me .
and you were here reading ?
yes .
ain' t that late for a lady your age to be up ?
i don' t think so .
got things on your mind that worry you ?
keep you awake ?
no , i just don' t sleep much .
you' ve been working for him a long time ?
sixteen years .
and you knew this phil church when he worked for the old man ?
yes , indeed , i knew him .
now , you just sit right down here and make yourself comfortable .
we' re gonna have a nice , long talk about what you knew about him .
you weren' t in bed and you' re all dressed .
where were you ?
i was sitting here , writing .
writing what ?
a play .
go on , what kind of a play ?
a mystery play .
so you write about murders ?
do you ever think much about murders ?
no .
and you say miss macfay and mrs. charles ... were the only ones in your room when it happened , right ?
no .
then there was someone else ?
yes .
who ?
the baby .
yes , the baby .
but not the nurse ?
no , the nurse was in her own room , asleep , i guess .
you' d better ask her .
her room is across from ours .
she ain' t in there , she ain' t anywhere in the house .
she' s gone .
personally , i think she' s very wise .
is that so ?
this is a murder we' re trying to clear up , lad .
so let' s don' t hang up on who tells what .
now , who gets the money ?
according to his last will ...
miss macfay was to get everything but $100, 000 .
that went to mrs. bellam .
well , now , what do you figure all but $100, 000 would amount to ?
certainly several millions .
you say you were asleep about an hour when you heard the shot .
i said half an hour .
stop wasting time here and start looking for him .
i got a lot of time to waste .
now , this church , you say you worked together .
are you and he still pretty close ?
we were never close .
you didn' t like each other much .
right .
are you unfriends enough so you' d like to see him in jail ...
or maybe the chair ?
are you suggesting that i' d frame him ?
now , don' t get sore over a little thing like that .
wait till you hear what i' m really gonna suggest .
it seems to me that every time your husband gets in with a girl ... the insurance companies take an awful beating .
now , it' s nice , very nice for a wife to trust her husband , but get this .
there' s that wynant girl he knew before he was married .
he comes here to new york and there' s a murder .
he goes back to the west coast , there' s a good looking girl there ... and there' s another murder .
he comes back here , meets this lois macfay ...
there' s another murder .
listen , we' re not dishing the dirt on your husband for the fun of it .
we' re trying to show you what you' re up against .
it ain' t that a man that' s had that many numbers ... could settle down to one .
was he really like that ?
was he ?
baby .
i always thought he was bragging .
he tell you about the coal man' s widow in cleveland ... that wanted to set him up into the agency for himself ?
was that jeanette ?
no .
her name was bella spruce .
bella spruce ?
and the lighthouse keeper' s daughter in ...
the what ?
the lighthouse keeper' s daughter .
what was her name ?
what it all comes down to is this lois .
you' re wrong to think there couldn' t be anything between them .
they' re just making a monkey out of you .
covering up for them .
i' m sure you' re right .
but what was the lighthouse keeper' s daughter' s name ?
letty finhaden .
letty finhaden .
he wasn' t in the room with you when it happened , was he ?
i say , he made you give him that alibi , didn' t he ?
no .
mr. charles .
i' m van slack , the asst. district attorney .
oh , yes .
i thought perhaps ...
well , of course , everybody knows your reputation ...
but if you don' t mind ...
not at all .
well , i' m a little confused .
the lamp torn away , a glass of water knocked over .
seems to have been quite a struggle .
but , nobody heard anything .
funny you didn' t , mr. charles .
the way i figure it .
macfay was lying here reading the paper .
he puts it down ... he turns off the lamp .
the murderer comes in through the door ... or the window .
macfay hears him , he grabs for his gun .
it was his gun , wasn' t it ?
yes , he kept it on the table .
from the look of this hole ... where would you say the bullet was fired from ?
i' d figure it come from about here .
then the murderer was already bearing down on his arm ... when macfay got the shot away .
or it could' ve gone off when it hit the floor ... after the arm was broken .
a paraffin test will show you whether he pulled the trigger .
yes .
the murderer knocked him back on the pillow with a blunt instrument .
then went after him with a knife .
anything to show that he came through the window ?
no , not yet .
one of the servants said the front door was open .
yes , if you and the two other gentlemen ... came , as you said , when the shot was fired ... wouldn' t you have seen or heard or ...
i didn' t get here that quickly .
the lights went out .
an electrician can tell you what happened ... when the wires were cut from that lamp .
electrician .
yes .
did you people have a man watching church ?
well , not exactly .
i suppose i should have .
the colonel was always yelling , imagining things ... which you know yourself is all pretty ridiculous .
could' ve been turned into a practical joke , couldn' t it ?
then you didn' t have ...
you didn' t have a heavy set man with thick glasses watching church ?
no .
i thought not .
i' d never seen a country cop with a $6, 000 coup before .
so i took down his number , i' il get it .
did you get anything out of mrs. charles ?
no , she' s bats .
i wish my old lady was bats that way .
here , darling , please drink this .
no one will tell me anything .
i' d feel better if i knew whether father ...
did he die without ...
there was no pain .
he died instantly .
where was he shot ?
he wasn' t shot .
it was a knife .
a knife ?
don' t talk about it now , dear .
let' s all get out of here as quickly as possible .
she can' t stay here .
that suits me .
just as soon as we finish with the police .
did you have your session with them ?
yes .
it was very interesting .
you think the police are going to be enough or ...
i should say they' re more than enough .
you' d better take a bromide .
you' re shaking like a leaf .
is there something you haven' t told us ?
yes , what is it , horn ?
it' s no wonder i' m jittery .
there' s someone out to get lois .
how do you know ?
i was warned over the phone ... just a little while ago , a man' s voice .
he said , " call everybody off or lois will get what her old man got .
no .
we' ve got to call everyone off .
we' ve got to .
you can' t call the police off once they' re in .
the warning said call off everybody .
it must have been one of church' s gang .
sure .
you think church murdered the colonel , don' t you ?
don' t you ?
of course .
your dog' s outside , running with a knife in its mouth .
asta , quickly .
that will be asta .
we' re gonna have to shoot it .
we' il never find him like this .
wait a minute .
he' s not gonna run to strange men with lights .
what do you think he is , a moth ?
call your men off , give me a flashlight .
give me that .
hey , boys , lay off .
give mr. charles a chance .
where did the dog find that knife ?
we don' t know .
he came around thataway .
where is he now ?
he went thataway .
i' il go thisaway .
asta .
asta , come here .
give it to me .
give it that back .
charles .
what ?
mr. charles .
yes , dear .
what is it ?
what are you doing out here ?
what' s the matter ?
it' s ...
he has a gun .
he has a what ?
look out !
why , it' s horn .
well , can you beat that ?
what were you shooting at him for ?
i wasn' t shooting at him , he was shooting at me .
why were you shooting at him ?
well , everybody else was .
she' s all right , she' s alive .
it' s just her arm .
carry her into the house .
what was she doing here ?
she came to tell me that someone was after me .
she yelled and pushed me out of the way just as he started shooting .
you don' t think she might have been trying to ...
you know ?
what do you mean ?
put me on the spot ?
no .
if she hadn' t pushed me , his first bullet would' ve caught me .
i almost heard it go past .
it was just a thought .
well , here' s the knife .
that' s the one that was used , all right .
could be the one that was tossed at me .
not much chance of fingerprints ... after the dog' s been playing with it for nobody knows how long .
i' m apologizing .
take it in .
tell them to check it anyway .
funny that the dog should have got hold of it the second time .
yes , you may be right .
miss macfay , when did you first suspect horn of killing your father ?
i didn' t say that .
i didn' t say he killed father .
your father objected to horn as your suitor , didn' t he ?
yes .
and if you' d married horn , he' d have cut you off without a dime ?
i suppose he would have .
as soon as your father was dead ... you became extremely attractive financially .
don' t .
please , don' t .
please , mr. van slack .
she' s been through too much already .
sorry , son .
what was the first reaction you saw on horn after the discovery of the murder ?
why , nothing .
he just came to tell me that father had been killed .
yes , then what ?
then he said to say that we were together when it happened ...
so the police wouldn' t bother me .
he said that ?
yes , he was only trying to protect me , and ...
he was trying to protect himself , child .
no , he couldn' t have .
freddie .
take it easy , lois .
maybe father was right about dudley , and i wouldn' t listen to him .
oh , poor father .
all right .
well , i guess that does it .
does what ?
well , don' t you get it ?
no .
we know that horn and church are enemies .
when church starts to threaten macfay , horn sees a chance to frame him .
he kills macfay using the cuban' s knife to do it .
if he wanted to frame church with the knife ... why should he try to kill me when i find it ?
looks to me as if you' ve got two mysteries on your hands instead of one .
now you know why i retired .
good luck .
you' re not walking out on me , are you ?
i' m not walking out , i' m running out .
if there were any reasonable chance for me to help you , it' d be different .
but , during this quiet little weekend in the country ... my family' s been threatened ...
i' ve had a knife thrown at me , i' ve been shot at , i' ve been suspected of murder .
from now , this is your case , you handle it .
i' m going back to new york and forget it .
come on , lois .
come on , mrs. bellam .
come on , freddie .
maybe i' m wrong .
come on , asta .
extra !
read all about it !
dream butcher hunted !
extra !
read all about it !
extra !
dream butcher hunted !
read all about it !
what is it ?
what are they calling ?
nothing .
have they found him ?
not yet .
how do you feel ?
sort of funny .
the doctor gave you something to make you sleep .
6 : 00 ?
have you been here all that time ?
i didn' t want you to be alone when you woke up .
you' re so good to me .
why shouldn' t i be good to my own flesh and blood ?
forgive me .
i didn' t mean ever to tell you .
it just slipped out .
i don' t understand .
don' t hate me .
please , don' t hate me .
i couldn' t bear it if you did .
i am your mother , but i don' t ask anything .
only to be allowed to stay near you .
we heard you talking so we knew you were awake .
are you all right , lois ?
why , yes .
what' s the matter , lois ?
you look upset .
it' s nothing .
it' s just that i' m so all at sea with father and dudley gone .
to go on , deciding things all alone ...
you won' t be alone long .
wait till the news of your $5 million hits the front pages .
you' il find you' ve got relatives all over the world .
look , lois .
i haven' t much to offer you , and i don' t ask anything in return .
but whatever happens , or wherever you are ... you can always know i' m standing by .
freddie , dear , you' re so sweet .
mr. charles .
mr. van slack' s in your room , waiting for you .
thank you .
mommy , i' il see you later .
what do you mean , later ?
i got rid of all those reporters .
what did you tell them ?
i told them we were out of scotch .
what a gruesome thought .
hello .
hiya , charles .
i don' t like to disturb you ... but the fact is we seem to work quite well together .
and i thought perhaps you might reconsider and come back on the case .
come back on the case ?
i' ve never been out of it .
what' s up ?
the new york police found the woman who was with church .
i' m on my way up there now .
would you care to come along ?
sure .
i' il get my hat .
i' ve been trying to trace that nurse , dorothy waters .
we have some fingerprints from the references she gave to mrs. charles .
they' re checking them now .
how about that license number ?
that car belongs to a man by the name of vogel .
a gambler racketeer .
i' il see him later .
that' s for you .
hello .
speaking .
who is it ?
never mind names .
just a friend of yours , telling you ... if you know what' s best for you , to lay off that macfay case .
you understand ?
let it alone .
if you don' t , we' il ship that body of yours back in a box .
thank you , but we have an encyclopedia .
isn' t that nickie crying ?
that wasn' t the baby .
he' s sound asleep .
nickie !
go on and ring .
hello ?
i' ve got to rush .
will you call back later ?
what ?
mr. charles is not here .
this is mrs. charles speaking .
mr. charles and i always work together .
i have an important information .
you come where i tell you .
but understand .
i am not a stool pigeon .
so do not bring any police .
i see .
what' s the address ?
i' il be there .
hello , lieutenant .
well , how are you , mr. charles ?
things sure pop when you' re in town .
they certainly do .
hello , mr. van slack .
hi , guild .
is this the smith woman' s apartment ?
but if your killing was at 1 : 00 last night then she' s in the clear .
we had a plant here from before midnight till after 3 : 00 ...
and she was here all the time .
you sure ?
positive .
i was here myself .
how did you happen to be watching her place ?
well , it turned out to be a false alarm ... but she called me up on the telephone last night ... and said that there was someone hanging around , that ...
say , could she have been using me as an alibi ?
why , she can' t do that to me .
hello , nick .
well , nice to see you again , lieutenant .
pleased to meet you .
come on in , sit down .
i' il go get you a cup of coffee .
never mind .
so you picked on me to give you an alibi ?
i got to lose a night' s sleep so you can duck a murder rap ?
so help me .
i never thought it was going to be murder .
what did you think ?
i knew phil was trying to get dough ... out of macfay , but i never knew he meant to murder him .
you know it now , don' t you ?
i don' t know anything that' s got anything to do with murders .
murders ?
how many other murders were planned besides macfay' s ?
i don' t know anything about anybody' s murders being planned .
you' re psychic ?
you get alibis for murders you don' t even know are going to happen .
i' m never going to need an alibi for murder ...
' cause i' m never going to have anything to do with murders .
where' s church ?
i don' t know .
he and dum dum left here about 11 : 00 last night .
i ain' t heard of him since .
where were they going ?
i don' t know .
when are they coming back ?
they' re not coming back .
they said they were going to cuba .
whose coat is this ?
phil' s .
phil church' s .
what' s it doing here if he' s not coming back ?
it' s been here two or three weeks .
how long have you known church ?
since they sprung him .
didn' t take you long to tie up with him .
we weren' t playing for keeps .
i was only stooging for him .
there are a lot of rackets where it' s handy to have a girl around .
blackmail rackets ?
i mean , a lot of rackets except murder .
there' s my bell .
sit down , i' il get it .
well , hello , diamond back .
come on in .
join the party .
we' re just asking smitty a few questions .
about church ?
i always figured he was a wrong guy .
what do you know about him ?
me ?
nothing , except that he' s been spending a lot of time hanging around smitty .
you haven' t been unloading to these people yet , have you ?
only from here up .
you ever hear about talking through a lawyer ?
we' ve got enough on her already to hold her as a material witness .
is this the man you saw watching church' s house ?
yes .
why , you big ape .
what' s the answer ?
her husband' s a pal of mine .
he' s been hanging on the wall upstate .
you know how those guys get to worrying .
i' ve been keeping an eye on her for him .
so that' s what' s been going on .
what do you think has been going on ?
you don' t think i been hanging around because i was nuts about you , do you ?
i hear church is going away .
this cluck might think she' s going with him .
suppose she had gone ?
that' s supposing too much .
there goes dum dum .
what have you done to phil church ?
what have you done ?
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
don' t act like that .
you know what i mean .
you found out we were going away and you knocked him off .
you big lug .
lay off , you .
when i find those glasses , i' il kill you .
you dirty rat .
you' d beat your own mother , you would .
i' il beat the hide off you if i find those glasses .

you' d lie about the weather , you double crossing , four eyed simp !
give me my glasses .
want to play policeman ?
where are my glasses ?
i knew there was copper in you , flatfooted stool pigeon .
give me my glasses and i' il get out .
i' il say you tried to dream him , that' s what i' il do .
he' il dream you into the hudson , where all you' il do is poison the fishes ...
you mousy looking ...
let go there .

well , i must be going .
good night .
good night .
i' il trade you two mumps for a measle , bella .
madam , how long have you been leading this double life ?
just since we' ve been married .
how did you know i was here ?
i saw a great group of men standing around a table .
i knew there was only one woman in the world who could attract men like that .
a woman with a lot of money .
bacardi .
two bacardis .
yes , sir .
the same .
yes , madam .
give me $14 . 75 . $14 ...

a man .
another one ?
this is the man who phoned after you left .
he' s somewhere right in this room .
he heard you were looking for dum dum .
now , dum dum owes him $14 . 75 and won' t pay him .
he said that if i gave him the $14 . 75 , he' d tell me where dum dum was .
how are you going to contact this mysterious informer ?
i told him i' d be holding the money in a handkerchief like this .
but , you didn' t have any money until i showed up .
i was doing all right .
i' d have gotten it .
madame .
at last .
hello .
i knew you would come to me .
i' ve been watching you all evening ... with that thought in heart and in my eyes .
shall we dance ?
yes , i think it would be better .
where is dum dum ?
dum dum ?
yes , i think i' d like to find him as soon as possible .
are you in love with him ?
no .
then why should he spoil the beauty of this moment ?
well , really .
i have a husband , you know .
a stupid american iceberg ?
well , he' s traveled abroad .
does he ever speak to you in burning words ... that make you go half mad with joy and yearning ?
well , he' s kind of cute .

i don' t know where he is .
your ear is getting into our drinks .
what' s eating you ?
i didn' t mean it .
you never mean anything .
but that don' t keep you from trying .
i do not know where mr. church is .
do you think he killed macfay ?
does a man say he think his friend killed ?
say , listen , i can tell you right now ... who kills most of the guys that get themselves killed in this town .
who are you looking at now ?
is that little swine dum dum ?
wait .
if you are not in love with him , why do you leave me ?

i thought he said that ...
lf you call this cuba .
he' s been hanging around these joints ever since he got out of stir .
say , you know more about this than the cops do .
and they' re all wrong , if they think phil was mixed up in that thing on the island .

i thought she was rather pretty .

mr. nick charles , please .
good morning , mr. charles .
this is guild .
well , we' ve got something on that nurse .
we just found that her fingerprints match up with an agnes borup .
i know agnes well , and from that landlady' s description of linda mills ... it just about fits her .
my guess is , if we get her , we get church .
no , i don' t think so .
well , for one thing , a new love has come into church' s life .
smitty may have stooged for him at first , but it' s the real thing now .
they' re planning on going away together .
come on up here .
i may have something for you .
yeah .
what ?
what have you got ?

you find out something ?
aren' t you interested , mrs. bellam ?
yes .
i haven' t got it all worked out yet , but ...
freddie , maybe you could help me .
you' re writing a mystery play .
oh , that .
how did you get your man ?
i haven' t gotten that far yet .
i' m stuck for a finish .

you didn' t snatch that , did you ?
we don' t wanna put the heat on this party .

yeah .
it' il be right up .
you' re telling me .
room service , please .
there' s a man outside , he wants to see you .
i put him in the study .
i thought mrs. bellam might be here .
i don' t know where she is .
can i do something ?
i just wanted someone to keep an eye on nickie .
let me .
that' s very nice , but i ...
lois should get some sleep anyway .
well , thank you very much .
send it right up .
who is this man ?
i don' t know .
a big man with heavy glasses .
vogel .
vogel ?
who' s vogel ?
he' s one of the missing pieces .
get your hands up .
both of you .
this is mr. church , darling .
skip it .
i got no time to waste .
i told you i' d be seeing you , charles , but i didn' t know it' d be this soon .
i' ve been dreaming again , charles .
only this time it' s about you .
you ought to be psychoanalyzed .
twice i' ve seen you dead in my dreams .
both times you were all battered up , just like macfay was .
so if you don' t want to be a widow , mrs. charles , get him on a train tonight .
i got a feeling i' m gonna have that third dream .
i' m packing right now .
okay .
now if you' re smart you' il wait five minutes before you blow any whistles .
get him .
what ?
don' t mind me .
go on , get him .
well , why ?
i never saw a man try so hard to get caught .
look at the clown climbing across that ledge in daylight .
why does he want to get caught ?
just part of his plan .
where is he ?
what happened , nick ?
who do you want blasted ?
a man' s been killed .
you all better get out of here before the police come .
grab your kids and scram .
what happened ?
get out of my way , will you ?
freddie , will you get nickie ?
of course i will .
shouldn' t we notify the police ?
they' il be here any minute .
where' s nickie ?
must be in the pen .
well , come on .
i got a feeling we better get out of here .
you want to see me ?
it wasn' t important .
just dropped in to see if there was anything new .
i' il wait till you' re free .
i' m free now .
tomorrow will do .
tomorrow you may not be free .
you' d better wait .
stand aside .
what' s going on here , casey ?
phil church was shot , he fell in the alley .
we arrested these two .
they were the only ones around .
i had nothing to do with it .
found this in the trash can .
one shell empty .
it wasn' t mine , i wouldn' t have any reason to kill phil .
bring them along upstairs , boys .
come on .
hear from the doctor ?
doctor says he was shot with a . 38 .
judging from the angle at which the bullet entered the body ... it could have come from most anywhere .
they' re working on the gun now to see if it' s the one .
what were you doing in the street down below ?
mr. church told me he was coming here .
i tell her .
then i' m afraid she come over and butt in maybe , so i come to stop her .
stop her ?
from what ?
i don' t know what she might do .
she get excited on phone .
what are you trying to do , frame me ?
phil was trying to pull a trick that' s too slick for his own good ... so i come over here to head him off .
you picked a good way to do it .
i have nothing to do with this .
i don' t know anything about murders ...
and i' m never gonna be ...
don' t give me that again .
well , what about it ?
did you see her do it ?
i just seen her and was crossing street to her .
truck got in my way .
if you want to know who killed phil church , ask him .
you heard him threaten what he' d do if we ran off together .
ask him .
you kill my mr. church ?
ask him where' s his gun .
i' ve got my gun right here .
don' t try to hang this on me .
you kill my mr. church ?
sure he did .
he killed phil .
here , come on .
get out of the way .
break it up .
that' s enough .
break it up .
all right .
come on , never mind .
break it up !
nickie , do something .
yes , of course .
all right , break it up .
here , now , you spitfire !
there .
sit down there .
you asked for it .
did somebody drop this chip ?
yes .
it' s mine .
good .
one more session like that , i' il call up the wagon and drag you all downtown .
may i say something ?
go ahead .
well , i have a hunch if we find out who murdered macfay ... we' il find out who murdered church .
maybe it' il clear things up if we start from the beginning .
tell me this first .
if you were trying a man for murder ... and he suddenly produced an airtight alibi , what would happen ?
he' d go free .
what if after you freed him , you found he' d planned the whole thing ...
what would you do ?
nothing .
nothing at all .
i see .
well , thank you very much .
you mean you' d let him get away with it ?
well , we' d have to .
you can' t try a man for the same crime twice .
if he' s acquitted , he could boast about it and we couldn' t touch him .
and that was church' s plan .
what was ?
he advertised himself as the murderer , while his accomplice did the dirty work .
he takes a house on long island .
he threatens macfay , terrorizes the household .
after the murder , he disappears ... still calling attention to himself as the killer .
when things look blackest for him , he walks in here , inviting me to take him .
his plan was to get tried for that murder , spring a last minute alibi ... and walk out of that court scot free .
you mean that he had this alibi all the time ?
yes , but he didn' t want us to know it .
that' s why dum dum beat up a drunk last night when he tried to tell me .
you did ?
was that it ?
was that why you hit him ?
i hit him because he start a fight .
maybe vogel will tell us .
he didn' t want it known either .
what are you trying to pull ?
your men jumped him , too .
were you in on this ?
you think i' d be in on a thing with that rat ?
looks bad for you , vogel .
you were down on the island .
you knew the set up .
you tried to keep smitty from talking .
your men threatened me .
told me if i didn' t lay off ...
my men ?
what men ?
the ones who dropped that chip at the west indies club last night .
come on , diamond back , spill it .
okay .
i run a place uptown .
it' s ...
well , it' s a place .
get what i mean , or should i wait for my lawyer ?
we get it .
you don' t want to admit you run a gambling joint .
go on .
the night before last , church comes in and sits in for two and a half hours ... including the time macfay was killed on the island .
then you helped him get his alibi .
i tell you i wasn' t in this with him .
i didn' t know what was going on .
then why did you keep it quiet ?
that night a bunch of my best customers were there .
a bank president .
big guys like that .
big and respectable .
if they admit in court they were there , they may as well cut their throats .
so i' m out to get the guys who can spill it .
and your men were out to get me , thank you .
i knew church' s plan was good , but i didn' t know it was that good .
he was a genius .
let me show you something else he planned .
wait a minute .
let' s not talk about church .
he' s dead .
it' s the killer we' re after .
yes , i' m coming to that .
you mean you know who he is ?
i have a pretty fair idea ... and if this trick turns out right , i' il be sure .
let' s say this is macfay' s room and that this is his bed .
we' il fix things just as we found them the night of the murder .
there was a newspaper on the floor .
stop me if i' m wrong .
here' s a paper .
let me see .
there were some books .
i' il get those , nickie .
thank you , mommy .
a glass of water .
i' il get it .
no , mrs. bellam , you stay here .
one of the boys will get it .
freddie , would you mind standing there ?
surely .
and watch everything very carefully .
a lamp ?
i' il get that .
as i remember , a cord was pulled from the lamp .
let' s see .
you forgot the gun .
yes , i have my own right here .
there we are .
now , may i have the books , mommy ?
you know , this trick should work , church planned it .
and church was an engineer .
here we are .
now , if you' il just let me have the paper .
here' s the paper .
thank you .
just one sheet will do .
it was just one sheet that was wet , wasn' t it ?
yes .
paper serves as a nonconductor .
i' il place this small piece between the exposed wire ... and the metallic part of the gun .
now the water , please .
you watching this carefully , freddie ?
yes .
this might be your finish .
now , we' il just drop the water in this indentation .
there you are .
do you mind plugging that in ?
thank you .
twelve minutes past .
please step to the other end of the room ?
but nothing happens .
give it time .
run , mommy , fast .
anyone for a drink ?
but , really , where does all this get us ?
remember , you said it was funny that i didn' t hear any sounds of a struggle ?
well , i did think that ...
i didn' t hear anything because there was no struggle .
but all this : his broken wrist , the shot he fired .
macfay didn' t fire that shot .
he was dead when it went off .
the murderer staged this whole thing , just as i have ... to make it look as if there' d been a row .
this little trick gave him or her ... a chance to get away and get an alibi .
well , that broken wrist sort of eliminates a woman , doesn' t it ?
it' s easy to break a dead man' s wrist .
even a woman could do that .
mrs. bellam .
yes ?
you were the last one to see col. macfay , weren' t you ?
yes .
what time was that ?
about midnight .
but you can' t say i did it .
he wasn' t killed until 1 : 00 .
you mean the shot didn' t go off until 1 : 00 .
we don' t know yet when he was killed .
you were an old sweetheart of macfay' s , weren' t you ?
weren' t you ?
what' s that got to do with it ?
maybe we' d better have everybody in on this .
try the second door down on the left .
the key' s in the lock .
who is it ?
lf i know my perfumes ... it' s dorothy or agnes or whatever her name is .
i haven' t done anything .
you let me go .
i haven' t anything to do with this .
then what are you doing here ?
i came to see mr. charles .
when i came to work for you , i' d gotten out of prison .
good gracious .
i was going straight .
i knew the police wouldn' t believe me after the killing , so i lit out .
but i couldn' t rest easy .
i had to explain to mr. charles .
why should an ex convict , seek employment ... in the home of a man known to the world as a great detective ?
because he never refused a break to anybody in his life .
i meant to prove to them that i could make good .
i was going to tell them .
that' s all right .
i knew about you .
wait a moment .
guild says this woman was the one at chestevere apartments .
i' m afraid for once the lieutenant is wrong .
she wasn' t .
look , nickie , it' s smoking .
it worked .
give me that rod .
i knew it was dum dum all the time .
was it him ?
no .
dum dum was only trying to get the accomplice who killed his mr. church .
but who ...
i' m afraid you people haven' t been paying attention .
this little trick i just showed you ... gave the murderer five minutes to get away and get an alibi .
there was only one person who used that particular alibi .
church planned this trick and you carried it through .
that' s why church had smitty to stooge for him .
so no one would suspect he was mixed up with another woman .
what are you saying ?
you' re friends with church and dum dum .
that' s why your dog was friends with them , let them come and go .
that' s why he stood on his hind legs , as the prints showed ... with his paws on his killer' s shoulders , when they cut his throat .
if they were friends , why did they kill him ?
to avoid suspicion that you and church were working together .
it' s a lie .
i killed macfay .
careful , freddie , you know what happened to horn when he tried to protect her .
what do you mean ?
i mean that horn must have known that she committed the murder .
he was jittery that night , almost out of control .
he told us he' d had a threat against lois ' life .
that was to divert suspicion from her .
horn wanted to get me off the case .
when i went out on the grounds looking for asta and that knife ... he knew that it would be fairly safe to take a shot at me .
if caught , he' d blame the darkness ... that he mistook me for church or dum dum .
you were afraid of horn , afraid that he might give you away .
besides , you were really stuck on phil church .
so you let horn go out to get me and then you ran on ahead ... and warned me , so that i' d have time to draw a gun on him .
then you pushed me out of the way , figuring that i' d shoot in self defense .
which i might have had to do ... but the police stepped in and did the job for us .
you' re guessing , saying horrible things .
only way that makes sense .
sense ?
what sense could there possibly be in my killing father ?
because you wanted his money and you wanted it now .
he gave me everything i could possibly need .
why he ...
that wasn' t your kind of life .
your kind of life was the linda mills life that you' ve been leading ... ever since you got the nerve to sneak out after the folks went to sleep .
linda mills ?
yes , my sweet .
l. m. " for linda mills and lois macfay .
linda mills , who sleeps without pillows just as you do .
linda mills , in whose apartment there' s a scorched spot ... and a bullet hole in the wall where this was rehearsed .
why , you can' t mean these things .
tell him it isn' t true .
it' s easy to prove .
we' il just take her to mrs. dolley .
when dum dum comes to , he can tell us ... but i wouldn' t advise you to wait for that .
dum dum' s a little sore at you for killing his mr. church .
my killing church ?
now , really ...
you found out after the murder that he ditched you for smitty .
you knew that he had you in a spot where he could blackmail you for life .
so you shot him as he stood on that ledge and threw the gun out your window .
you' re right about linda mills and all the other things .
i got sick of playing little red riding hood to that old guy .
when phil was trying to get money out of him ...
i found we spoke the same language .
i' m not sorry for it .
it was a chance and i took it .
i' il make a deal with you .
and what will you offer us , the moon ?
you like that brat of yours , don' t you ?
all right .
you let me walk out of here and i' il send him back in a half hour .
what did you do with him ?
i put him in lois ' room .
go look .
she can look all she wants .
she won' t find him .
if anything' s happened to that kid ...
is he there ?
it isn' t him , nickie' s gone .
make up your mind .
send me to the chair or get your kid back all in one piece .
wait a minute .
you can' t go in there .
i gotta go in there .
i want to go in there .
let me in here .
where' s my baby ?
where' s my raphael ?
he' s in here .
trying to pull a fast one ?
i saw it wasn' t their kid and i took a chance .
you can' t blame me for trying .
well , come on .
you ungrateful little fiend .
what' s the matter , ma ?
don' t you call me ma .
so you admit it' s a gag ?
well , better luck on your next racket .
all right , get going .
give me a gun .
what ?
another murder ?
that dog .
he won' t let me have the baby .
asta .
take it easy .
quiet now , will you ?
where' s my baby ?
my raphael , my beautiful baby .
my lovely little cherub .
you can' t blame me for making a mistake .
they both look alike , don' t they ?
you imbecille !
my gorgeous , my beautiful raphael .
all right , don' t get excited .
you don' t tell me ...
mommy ?
let' s sit down .
sit down ?
what for ?
just to get a little rest , after our quiet weekend in the country .
