you' re lucky , you know .
i rarely allow anyone into my flat .
i know , i know , i know .
humble digs .
not exactly what you' d call a " panty peeler .
do you know what i mean ?
but it suits me just fine .
to be honest , i rarely spend a night in my own bed anyway .
for most women , if a guy' s a good provider and generally a nice chap , six pack abs really aren' t a deal breaker .
on the flip side , however , even though the pc boyfriend sat next to you with his arm slung around your shoulder will deny it ...
and he will deny it .
for us boys , it' s all about f. b. b.
face .
boobs .
bum .
i' m just being honest .
it' s been said that clothes speak the international language .
and i have to admit , i' m a bit of a fashion whore .
unfortunately , today i' ve got work , and i have to tone it down a little bit , but that' s all right .
gucci .
end of summer sale .
very understated .
and i can easily spice it up with ...
what ?
no , no .
i know what you are thinking .
if you ooze masculinity , like some of us do , you have no reason to fear pink .
smashing .
now , in the cologne department , most men overdo it .
americans practically spray it on with a crop duster .
nothing above the neck , though i do like a little splash on big ben .
you never know where the day may take you .
almost forgot .
new word for the day .
the attempt to attract attention to oneself .
who ?
me ?
oh , blimey .
i' m so rude .
i haven' t introduced myself .
i' m ...
alfie ?
there you go .
alfie .
are you the little elf that left these mocha bonbons on my doorstep ?
no , no , no .
you must have a secret admirer , mrs schnitman .
you are such a doll , alfie .
but i' m supposed to be on a diet .
oh , on a diet ?
a diet .
you ?
yeah .
now , i don' t mean to be forward , lu , but you should know by now that a full figured girl like yourself
is every guy' s secret fantasy .
stop it .
so she' s a tub of lard .
the ship' s already sailed , so why not make her feel good about herself , right ?
oh , lu ?
yes , angel ?
i' m working the night spot , and my apartment is a horror show , so i' m sorry if i keep you up
with the dust busting at 2 a . m .
oh , don' t you worry .
i' il give it a quick straighten .
oh , no , no , you don' t need to that .
nonsense .
i like doing things for you , alfie .
i' m a blessed man having you in my life .
thank you .
keys are in the usual spot .
now , back home , you' re always hearing tales about some bloke migrating to the states and winding up with buckets of money .
so not long ago , i packed up my bucket and headed west .
now , i must admit , i had a second motive .
i' d always been told that the most beautiful women in the world ... ... resided in manhattan .
location , location , location .
god , i love this city .
all right , girls .
just look around .
i mean , every one of them , unique , special ,
like snowflakes .
and with such a plethora ...
calendar word meaning " abundance , " of gorgeousness and diversity , well , how could a man ever choose to settle down with just one ?
i myself subscribe more to the european philosophy of life .
my priorities leaning towards wine , women ...
well , actually , that' s about it .
wine and women .
although , women and women is always a fun option .
so ... ... to live life to the fullest ,
i require only enough to cover my modest expenses .
i' ve no desire to be the richest stiff in the cemetery .
i think this might just be my favourite position .
i know it was president kennedy' s .
he was such a great leader .
of course , jfk used the old bad back excuse , but if you ask me , he knew it gave you maximum pleasure with minimum exertion .
what is it about the back of a limo ?
obligatory cuddling .
thousand one , thousand two ...
cripes .
hey , i' ve gotta get cracking .
i' ve got a 10 : 00 pickup .
you better hurry up .
you don' t want to keep her waiting .
quite the number , isn' t she ?
yet , she tells me her old man hasn' t shagged her in six months .
six months .
i mean , thank god there are gentlemen like me around to pick up the slack .
just look at her .
legs like a racehorse .
perfect yoga bum .
a minus .
where did we tell the old man we were going tonight ?
a movie .
treasure , please , no , no , no .
stop messing about .
you' il ruin my presets .
sorry .
what movie ?
i don' t know .
what' s the difference ?
the difference is , the more detail you give , the less interested he' il be .
it wouldn' t matter what i said .
it would never occur to phil that another man
would ever look twice at me .
dor , darling , you fishing for a compliment ?
no .
you should know by now they only come from me when least expected .
now , come and have a mint so phil doesn' t smell the alfie on your breath .
i don' t care if he does .
it' s married women .
dorie doesn' t know it yet , but you won' t be seeing much more of her .
i' ve got that all too familiar feeling .
sooner or later , she' il be wanting a little bit more than i' m able to give .
wouldn' t it be great if i was going home with you tonight instead of phil the pill ?
yeah .
it' s definitely time to stage a disappearing act .
so next tuesday , same time , same place ?
i' m sorry , love , it' s fashion week .
i' m booked double shifts .
i' il call you the instant things let up .
okay .
in the meantime , i left you a little souvenir to remember me by .
oh , dor ?
your derrire looks really rather ravishing from this vantage point .
see ?
a compliment when least expected .
what can i say ?
happy as a pup with two tails .
and i think i' ve done old phil a bit of a favour too .
of course , he' d be the last to see it .
never expect any thanks in this life .
you know what i mean ?
so tuesday ... ... 10 : 03 p . m .
do i drag myself home to a cold flat , empty fridge , or nip across town for a hot bath , warm body , breakfast in bed ?
decisions , decisions ...
yeah , i think i' il pay a visit to my semi regular , quasi , sort of girlfriend .
my sweet julie .
let me guess .
unexpected last minute fare .
yeah .
she had me going up and down for hours .
that supposed to be funny ?
because it is so very ...
not .
hey !
i' m not kidding , alfie !
i' m not kidding .
i hate you sometimes .
you have a very ostentatious way of showing it .
yeah , i sure do .
no , darling .
can we hit pause ?
i just need a second to unwind .
oh , i nicked half a bottle of stoli from the limo .
how do you want yours , on the rocks ?
i just want my usual , alfie .
straight up .
no , i' m so totally knackered .
i' il make it up to you in the morning .
cross my heart .
but tonight , all i' m good for is a bite to eat , hot bath and a nice long sleep .
you know , this isn' t a holiday inn , alfie .
what' s that again ?
where were you tonight ?
really ?
you' ve got to open a restaurant .
that' s seriously delicious .
thanks , alfie .
it' s just chilli .
hey .
a little eye contact , please .
we have something here , or am i just a glorified booty call ?
hey .
hey .
she wants me to commit .
become " domestified .
now , it doesn' t do to become dependent on anybody in this life .
change your nature , you' re a dead man .
chilli , please .
don' t get me wrong .
she' s adorable .
cute ?
absolutely .
but is it ever enough ?
i told you how we men are .
we want showstoppers .
and the problem is , julie hasn' t got enough of the superficial things that really matter .
i don' t deserve you .
yeah , that' s probably true .
too bad i love you .
thanks , babe .
alfie , alfie ...
what ?
you' re giving me the " thanks , babe .
you' re giving me the " thanks , baby .
calm down .
don' t tell me to calm down !
i know how you feel !
wait a minute .
you' re gonna wake up ...
max .
hey , little man .
did we wake you up ?
yes .
now , lads , learn from my mistake .
never get involved with a single mum .
see , they come with accessories , some of which can be ... ... unfortunately , irresistible .
sights like that make you realize we all have an expiration date .
and women do have a shorter shelf life than men , don' t they ?
i think that' s what julie was banging on about yesterday .
elegant limousine and chauffeur .
this is where i make my reasonably honest living .
standards of elegance has taken quite a pounding , wouldn' t you say ?
i know .
believe me , it' s merely a stepping stone .
currently parked on one of those stepping stones is my best mate and future business partner , marlon .
black .
like lonette' s skin ... ... which i will never again touch .
i' m afraid you' re not meeting my man on top form .
see , marlon' s got a problem .
it' s called lonette .
and very recently , it dumped him .
oh , dear .
come on , what was it this time ?
three a . m .
begging , at her front door .
level of inebriation ?
vomiting .
right .
so let me get this straight .
you were at her front door , 3 a . m .
in the morning , begging and vomiting ?
and what , she wasn' t charmed by that ?
alfie ?
why is there no stoli in car number two ?
i' ve no idea .
i gotta watch this guy like a hawk .
that little chap' s name is wing .
my boss and owner of this tragic enterprise .
wipe that car good .
owner , that is , till me and marlon swing a loan and buy it out from underneath his scrawny ...
hello .
you miss bird shit .
wing .
he' s barking mad .
check out the way he talks to the little woman .
she' s given him her best years , cooked his chop suey , helped with the business , and i bet at one time he couldn' t wait to rip off her kimono .
and now look at him .
and i' m supposed to respect the institution of marriage ?
that' s a great figure , man .
we swing that loan , cash your ira , i hock my vespa ...
we' re gonna take wing by surprise with an offer like this .
i could' ve predicted this .
see , marlon and lonette have reached that critical 18 month " where are we going , what are we doing , what' s happening here ? " crisis point that rears its ugly head in every relationship .
lonette wanted ring , home , baby .
marlon wanted another 18 months to make sure nothing better was coming his way .
i fucked up egregiously .
i see you' re making the most of that birthday calendar .
by the time he realized he' d made a mistake and he wanted her back ... ... it was too late .
hey , stranger .
hey .
carol .
carol .
hi , carol .
hi .
you look wonderful .
so , carol , well , it' s nice to see you again .
you be well .
what' s up with that ?
put it this way , the show closed after one performance only .
do i even wanna know why ?
no .
come on , it would be less than discreet to tell you why .
hair on the arms .
seriously .
long , thick ...
what are you talking about ?
you don' t have hair on your arms ?
you' re looking very lovely tonight .
thank you .
dude , the iron door has slammed shut , man .
classic , isn' t it ?
now that he can' t have her , he thinks he can' t live without her .
some people are funny .
marlon' s predicament got me thinking about my own situation .
maybe ...
maybe it was time to stoke the home fires .
anybody in the mood for a little alfie , straight up ?
oh , this isn' t a good time , alfie .
got a lot on my mind .
oh , god .
yeah , i really hate when that happens .
open up , baby .
you look seriously beautiful .
not tonight , alfred .
what' s the matter ?
tell me .
i don' t ...
i' m just ...
well , i guess i' m ...
i' m just ...
i' m just seeing red .
i mean , the poor guy , he' s dying .
come on , haven' t you ... ?
you' ve tortured him long enough .
alfie , he should' ve thought about all that before he was screwing around with that ex girlfriend of his .
those fake ass , $5 titties .
those are fake ?
hello ?
wow , i' m devastated .
they' ve got , like ...
alfie , you' re supposed to be consoling my devastation , remember ?
i am .
look , he came back , didn' t he ?
begging , crawling on his knees , vomiting ...
i don' t care .
i' m sorry , i' m not that easy .
i don' t forgive and i definitely do not forget .
is okay if i leave now , miss ?
oh , s , felix .
and hit the lights on your way out , por favor .
i better go .
it' s really coming down out there .
yeah .
and i' m wearing suede .
you' re telling the truth .
that' s brilliant .
okay .
i got one .
i never swam in the pacific ocean .
me neither .
oh , shit .
okay .
okay .
i' ve never seen a james bond movie .
you' re joking .
not even a sean connery ?
you serious ?
wow , i don' t know if that' s magic or tragic .
okay .
five ball .
my go .
i' ve never made my own bed .
oh , bullshit .
no , i repeat , i' ve never made my own bed .
well , what kind of mama you got ?
that' s a good question .
let' s see .
all right .
i got something for you .
all right .
i' ve never had sex ...
i' ve never had sex with two people in one night .
six five , your favour .
gotcha .
so , alfie , what' s the most you' ve had in one night ?
we' ve stopped playing the game , haven' t we ?
am i wrong , or is there a little innocent flirting going on here ?
driftin ' on a memory
ain' t no place i' d rather be than with you
loving you
see , if i had that kind of talent ...
and a song
go on , finish your sentence .
if i had that kind of talent , and i looked like you ...
and a song ... i would be strutting my stuff oh , yeah ?
on a stage .
trust me , what happens next was the furthest thing from my mind when i dropped by tonight .
but then i thought to myself ,
you know what ?
if this will help her get past her anger towards marlon ,
i owe it to both of them , as a friend , right ?
to do whatever i can to help .
i find that , lately , even lying to myself comes easily .
the next morning , and i can' t get last night out of my mind .
try desperately to focus on something else , anything else .
anything to get my mind off my best friend' s incredibly hot , best ass i' ve ever seen in my life girlfriend .
alfie .
alfie .
alfie !
shall i pretend i can' t hear him ?
dude .
hey !
too late .
too late .
dude , would you slow down ?
hey , marly , what' s up ?
marly " ?
hey , listen , i gotta talk to you .
you ain' t going nowhere till you tell me what went down last night .
down last night ?
dude , don' t mess with me .
what happened with lonette ?
have you ever heard the word " knock " ?
what went down ?
what ?
nothing happened .
we had a few shots .
missus give me silent treatment .
little she know , not hearing constant " blah , blah , blah " is gift from heaven .
you keep it up .
keep it up , mate , it' il work .
alfie , what happened ?
oh , fuck a duck , man .
look , i ...
i drank a lot last night .
drunk .
well , i ...
i really ...
i don' t remember .
dude , you did something to her .
no .
oh , yeah , you did .
because she shows up at my house , at 4 in the morning , saying that she wanted me back .
she even said that if i needed more time , that she understood completely .
how fucking crazy .
chalk one up for the blokes .
thanks to me , marlon won the game .
which means he' s off scot free , and so am i.
this is a bloody miracle .
that' s fantastic .
fantastic .
come on , what did you say to her ?
look , look .
it' s all good .
come on , what did you say ?
i asked her to marry me .
you know you' re my best man , right ?
no good deed goes unpunished .
new word for the day ?
the ability to readily recover after disappointment or loss .
capacity to spring back .
understand , it' s not about replacing julie .
women who mean nothing to me .
so i' ve struck up a friendship with a nightclub hostess called uta .
hello , uta .
now , as a heat seeking bachelor ,
i have to live by some very simple rules .
alfie elkins ' credo or philosophy , which is probably best summed up by the only advice my father ever gave me .
he said , " son , whenever you meet a beautiful woman ... ... just remember , somewhere there' s a bloke who' s sick of shagging her .
can i help you , man ?
g and t , please .
explain to me what everyone sees in that eurotrash ?
i think it' s incredibly unfair that it' s acceptable for men to be sexually experimental , then with a woman , if she wants to try something ...
a kiss or a threesome .
you know , that they' d be judged .
i wouldn' t judge them .
and i think if you two were to kiss , i would ...
i would just ...
i would just see it as a thing of beauty .
although i' m living every guy' s rat pack fantasy , something feels a bit off .
and throwing myself back into the old lifestyle isn' t going quite as smoothly as i' d hoped .
sorry .
i' m sorry .
you carry on without me .
oh , my loves , i ...
i don' t know what happened .
this is so unlike me .
yeah , you ...
you two just ...
i used to think there was nothing worse than death .
then , from out of nowhere ... ... the unthinkable .
now i really don' t get what everyone sees in you .
it just keeps on happening and happening .
or more accurately , not happening and not happening .
this never happens , uta .
honestly , never .
honestly .
not the word around town ... ... peewee .
mr elkins ?
miranda kulp .
miranda .
the penis doctor is a he with a little bit of she thrown in .
so i understand you' re experiencing some erectile dysfunction .
i am experiencing a little ...
a little ...
a little bit of ...
what you just said .
not to worry .
that' s my area of expertise .
so have you been under any unusual emotional stress lately , mr elkins ?
stress ?
emotional ?
me ?
no , never .
well , unless you count that recent chat i had with julie .
i can' t see you anymore , alfie .
why ?
you angry ?
no , i' m really not angry .
just , you know , we want different things .
and i can' t have you traipsing in and out of max' s life .
you' ve changed your hair , haven' t you ?
you have , haven' t you ?
no , you have .
you' ve changed your hairdo .
you cut it ?
it looks gorgeous .
thanks .
how come ... ?
how come you never had it like that when we were together ?
i really gotta go .
well , i guess ... ... you need these back .
thank you .
alfie ?
you gonna be okay ?
yeah .
no worries .
i' m always okay .
alrighty , let' s take a gander at that penis of yours .
i see .
well .
it seems we have lift off .
it seems we do .
wunderschn .
what a relief .
well , i mean , if he can give me a stiffy , i should have no problem keeping it up for the target demographic , shouldn' t i ?
well , there doesn' t appear to be anything physiologically wrong , so , in short , we can be fairly certain your problem
was simply stress related .
julie related .
like i always say , if they don' t get you one way , they' il get you another .
however ,
i did feel something a little kooky .
kooky ?
there is nothing to get upset about , mr elkins .
i thought i felt a lump ... ... on your penis .
but with any luck , it will be nothing .
the words " lump " and " penis " in the same sentence .
there' s something you don' t hear every day .
and so young alfred got an early yuletide gift .
a penis biopsy .
i get my test results in three days ...
well , five .
five counting the weekend .
oh , lord .
oh , lord .
how am i gonna stop myself going completely bonkers ?
i' il be fine .
i' il be fine .
i' m a young man .
shift focus , alfie .
shift ...
let' s go , kids .
let' s go .
move along , children .
look straight ahead .
come on .
do not look at the man .
look straight ahead .
in the meantime , perhaps i' m safer hobbling on home .
alfie , dear , what' s wrong ?
you look like death warmed over .
no , i' ve just ...
i' ve got a bit of a football injury , that' s all ,
mrs schnitman ...
hello , mrs liberman .
you two look lovely .
where you going ?
shopping .
you need anything ?
i' m fine .
hello .
can i talk to you for a minute ?
ladies , this is my friend lonette .
she' s lovely .
good for you , dating an african american .
yeah .
hey .
hey , girl .
i missed you .
don' t mind us .
we' re not here .
you kids keep talking .
very nice to meet you .
see you , mrs liberman .
shop till you drop , girls .
so how have you been ?
i' m pregnant .
it seems to me the problems you worry yourself sick about never seem to materialize .
it' s the ones that catch you unexpectedly on a wednesday afternoon that knock you sideways .
i offered to face the music with her ... ... but she wanted to go it alone .
we both knew that if the baby was born with any white boy features it would mean the end of lonette and marlon .
not to mention your host for this evening .
but standing in the cold , i find myself having regrets .
thinking thoughts like ,
here' s another kid you' il never get a chance to know .
your own .
didn' t take long .
bloody hell , you' re freezing .
how do you feel ?
empty .
that night in the bar , i thought i was getting something for nothing .
doesn' t seem to have worked out that way , does it ?
oh , man .
if everything turns out okay , maybe this little brush with mortality is a sign .
i should think about making ...
making some changes .
possibly .
next week .
excuse me .
did i just ... ?
did you just look at me ?
did i just notice you turn away ?
look , if you know the results to my tests , and they' re telling you ...
mr elkins .
please .
please .
mr elkins , for the millionth time , sit down .
mr belson , i have a cancellation on tuesday at 11 : 30 .
i' m gonna be fine .
i just feel it .
thank you .
goodbye .
i' il just be a minute .
or ten .
it' s all right .
take your time .
i don' t have a choice .
i used to pee .
now i trickle .
i' m joe .
what' s your name ?
alfie .
so how you doing , alfie ?
hanging in .
you ?
shitty .
yeah , me too .
me too .
i like the bolo tie .
oh , thanks .
i have a collection .
you know , when you' re old , you learn to be patient .
yeah .
used to be i never had time for nothing .
go , go , go .
i know that feeling .
yeah .
my wife was always hawking me to take a little vacation .
hawaii .
reno .
i always said , " next year , evie , next year .
i got too much on my platter .
i always thought i' d have more time .
then one sunday night , she takes the pot roast out of the oven .
yells , " soup' s on , " and slumps to the kitchen floor .
just like that .
dead as disco .
jesus , i' m sorry .
i tried picking up the pieces .
even went to waikiki alone on the 8 day cruise package she was always yakking about .
couldn' t get evie out of my mind .
you find someone to love , and live every day as though it were your last .
she' s all yours , alfie .
enjoy .
you all right , son ?
yeah .
i hope so .
look , if you ever get bored or feel like schmoozing ... ... give me a holler .
you' il never call .
maybe i will .
all right , good .
we' il go to a bar together , hit on some chicks .
damn right .
thanks , joe .
hey .
i' m sorry about evie .
we ... ... weren' t all that fond of each other ... ... but we were very close .
if you know what i mean .
i think i do .
i' ve been thinking a lot lately about god and death .
and how , if what they taught me in bible class is true ,
i' m really in for it .
but i won' t be partying with lucifer any time soon , because my test results were negative .
i' m gonna live !
i' m gonna live !
i ruined my prada lace ups and i don' t care .
don' t think i' ve forgotten my oath to completely change my life , because i haven' t .
carrot apple with a dash of wheat grass .
yep .
health is now priority number one .
business plan moves onto the fast track .
if you say so ...
tonight' s preview at st. ambrose ...
no , i definitely don' t want to talk .
okay , hold on , what else have i got ?
okay , yeah .
all right , if we must , we must , but ...
new slate .
new beginning .
what' s your name , driver ?
alfie , sir .
wait here , alfie .
do you know how long you' re gonna be , roughly ?
you got someplace to go ?
no , i was just gonna nip off
and get a cup of tea .
look , why don' t you just stay put .
yea or nay ?
a definite yea , i think .
really .
stunning .
wouldn' t you say so , sir ?
i' m sorry , didn' t i ask you to wait by the car ?
i reckoned i should help the lady with her packages .
definite yea ?
i think .
with one minor ...
may i ?
you may .
adjustment .
bullfighter .
another lifetime .
don' t ask .
fifty , if she' s a day .
but don' t they say 50 is the new 40 , and is she not living proof ?
i mean , have a look .
beautifully preserved .
and cleavage like the holland tunnel .
better ?
much .
you are so right to trust chanel .
a pair of hot pink stilettos , and you' re good to go .
well , aren' t you mr full service ?
we try .
he' s getting a little pissy , isn' t he ?
oh , it' s fine .
it' s good for him .
is your husband a lot older than you ?
he' s not my husband .
he' s wearing a wedding ring .
well , i never said he wasn' t somebody else' s husband .
grab the stuff from the trunk ?
you got it .
cheers .
ma' am , if you require my services in the future .
happy christmas , sir .
ma' am .
now that , my friends , is a real woman .
smart and sexy and ...
you noticed the little flirt going on between us , huh ?
makes me think , if a woman like that , of that calibre should take notice of a bloke like me , then , perhaps ...
perhaps i' m selling myself a bit short .
in a flash ,
i have my new year' s resolution .
aim higher .
catastrophic .
doomed .
desolate .
cataclysmic .
bought him a word of the day calendar for christmas .
big mistake .
holiday season , busiest time of the year .
i try to run a business .
what' s the problem , mr wing ?
your soul brother .
he quit .
in the letter marlon left me , he called me his best friend ... ... but apologized for bailing on our business scheme .
he said his whole thing now was to make lonette happy .
they decided , on the spur of the moment , to move upstate , and i had a standing invite to drop by any time .
somehow lonette convinced marlon it would be too painful to say our goodbyes in person .
christmas eve .
a night that brings on all those familiar festive feelings of hopelessness , anguish , despair .
not a great time to be flying solo .
that' s why i' m of the belief couples should never split up between thanksgiving and january 2nd .
always have a relationship to see you through the holidays .
always .
the downside , of course , being gifts .
personally , i' ve always suspected that everyone else is having a far merrier christmas than i am .
not that i' ve ever actually had a christmas .
that' s a whole other dickens story .
taxi .
taxi .
excuse me .
i' m sorry , mate , it' s against the law for me to carry any more than ...
thank the lord .
a christmas miracle .
all right , hop in .
thanks for saving us .
i was freezing my little tush off .
no worries .

merry christmastime
there' s an expression the yanks use , " go with the flow .
so , yeah , i got a dose of the holiday blues .
but when a girl of this mind blowing calibre invites you to a party , it' s time to get going and start flowing .
maybe it' s the late hour .
maybe it' s the heavily spiked eggnog .
maybe it was simply a mutual desperate desire to have ourselves a merry little christmas .
i' m renovating my apartment on the upper west side .
but , say , you could ... ... crash at my sublet , if you want .
