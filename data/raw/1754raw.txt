they were my two best friends in the whole world .
for five weeks .
it was a total accident we even met .
me , a bum from brooklyn using phoney frequent flyer miles .
tony croft was kind of a golden boy from harvard school of architecture .
we met lewis mcbride , this long haired greenpeace tree hugger guy .
so the plan was to party till we ran out of cash in malaysia .
it was a paradise of rum , girls , and good , cheap hash .
whoo !

but this is my least favourite part anyway , the talking stuff .

i don' t think i' m cut out for that kind of thing , lew .
that' s for you , man .
to tell you the truth ...
i don' t have that kind of stuff in me .
well , i think you' re wrong about yourself , but ...
give ' em hell .
where are you gonna go ?
new york is calling you home .
martinis , pretty girls , the yankees .
or do you want to stay here ?
don' t smoke it all in one bowl .

that' s my dispatcher .
i gotta go .
i gotta go .

lady named eastern , asked for you .
eastern ?
eastern , yeah .
where' s the drop at ?
she didn' t say .
fuck !
i apologise for the sudden stop , folks , but hopefully you were belted in .
ok .
here we are .
here .
take that .
pleasure serving you as always , mr homer .
this is ravitch .
hey , it' s sheriff .
how much is a famous divorce attorney worth to you ?
he' s worth squat , brother .
i' m single .
what if he' s out boinking and getting bombed and his wife' s not with him ?
that' s a different story .
ravitch , can' t you find another desk ?
i say two bills .
you' re a cheap son of a bitch .
grab a pen .
i' m sorry .
ok , give it to me .
thank you .
we headed anywhere in particular ?
how about we just drive around the park for a bit ?
you got it .
around the park .
i haven' t driven you before .
i never forget a face .
do you mind if i smoke in the car ?
it' s the only place in town left that you can smoke .
go ahead .
so who recommended me , miss eastern ?
please call me beth .
ok .
who recommended me , beth ?
lewis mcbride .
lew ?
did he say to look up old sheriff when you got to town ?
how did you know where to find me ?
lewis said you lived in brooklyn .
odds were you' d be in the book .
yeah , huh ?
and odds were i' d still be stuck in brooklyn , which obviously i am .
so where is lew ?
is he in town here ?
sheriff , the day you and tony left penang , a man came looking for a bike you guys had rented .
he brought the police .
only they didn' t find the bike , but they did find 104 grams of hashish , some stashed in the hut , some in the trash .
jesus christ .
and lewis caught hell for that , huh ?
yeah .
he' s spent the last two years in prison .
oh , my god .
jesus christ .
what a nightmare that must be , huh ?
is he still in prison now ?
for eight more days , yeah .
i wish i' d have known sooner .
i don' t know if i could have done anything but ...
at least he' s getting out in eight days though , huh ?
that' s not the case .
anybody found with more than 100 grams of hashish is considered to be trafficking .
trafficking ?
what is that , like , dealing ?
sheriff , in order for lewis not to be considered a dealer , you and tony have to fly back to penang and accept your share of the responsibility .
and what about me and tony ?
what happens to us ?
the deal was that if both of you go back , it' s three years apiece , and if only one of you goes back , it' s six .
wait .
hold on .
it' s three ?
it' s six ?
finish that sentence for me please .
you' re talking about three years in prison .
six years in prison .
let me make this clear to you .
in malaysia , dealers get death .
jesus christ , for a shitty brick of hash ?
so in eight days from now ...
lewis mcbride is going to hang .
what are you , his lawyer ?
i' m his american lawyer , yeah .
so how about we have dinner and talk more about this ?
i can' t .
i' m on till 2 : 00 .
but thank you very much .
drinks then ?
at 2 : 00 ?
don' t you sleep ?
i want to do this more .
breakfast ?
can' t .
lunch ?
i pulled a day shift .
let' s have dinner then .
tomorrow night .
here .
say 7 : 00 ?
tomorrow at 7 : 00 .
night .
thanks .
excuse me , i' m looking for tony croft .
yeah , he' s up top .
thanks .
so if you don' t go back , tony , lewis will hang .
sorry .
you can' t come out of nowhere and tell me the bottom' s dropped out of my life and i' ve got a week to brace for the impact .
i' m sorry , tony .
that' s exactly what i am doing .
i don' t understand .
how come it took you guys two years to tell me this ?
lewis never mentioned the two of you .
not when he was convicted two years ago , not when he was sentenced to death .
it was only last week when his final pardon appeal was rejected .
i found a detective , the second he found you , here i am .
you gotta understand , this isn' tjust about me , all right ?
like anybody , i have a lot of responsibilities .
i' m engaged .
i have a fiance .
i want to start a family .
family' s wonderful .
lewis would like to have kids too .
if you can postpone having yours for a few years , he' il have that chance .
i' m staying at the stanhope .
could you call me there tonight ?
all right .
i will .
thanks .
thanks , tony .
this is beth .
miss eastern ?
hi .
it' s tony croft .
tony , hi .
listen .
kerrie and i talked this over and we want to , um ...
well , first of all i wanna say ... this is ridiculous .
there is no way in hell that i' il do the six years .
but if sheriff agrees to go back ...
um ... well , that' s another ...
uh ...
in that case , um ... you know , it' d be pretty hard to say no .
uh ...
ok .
what you' ve said has been very clear .
i' m about to have dinner with sheriff .
i' il call you in the morning .
all right .
i' il talk to you then .
thank you , tony .
good night .
hey .
hi .
surprised i showed ?
no .
why ?
cos i am .
eastern party ?
yeah .
right this way .
thanks .
would you care for a cocktail ?
glass of house red .
ok .
i' il have a rum and coke , please .
thank you .
reminds me of malaysia .
rum and coke .
so have you spoken to tony ?
yes , i did .
yeah ?
mm hm .
tony said he was going to go back .
yeah ?
tony said he was going to call me when he got back from penang .
so ...
so what are you saying ?
i can' t count on tony' s word ?
no , i' m not saying that .
just , uh ...
i think it' s good tony says he' s going back .
how come ?
because i' m ...
excuse me .
your drinks .
thanks .
thanks a lot .
tony' s only going back if you' re going back .
you didn' t say that .
i didn' t finish .
ok , please finish then , beth .
finish what you were going to say .
i don' t expect you to do this without some sort of compensation .
both of lewis' s parents have passed on .
they left a little something .
how does $50, 000 sound ? $50, 000 ?
that sounds fine .
just fine .
but for each year . $50, 000 a year .
you want me to pay you $150, 000 for assuming what is , in fact , your share of the responsibility ?
no , not you .
lewis' s estate .
i mean , they got the heavy money , right ?
you come to new york on what was pretty much a fishing expedition .
you stay on the park , eat here , not some coffee shop .
all right .
so i will draw up the draft agreement tomorrow .
if you promise me right now that you' re going to go back .
you know what' s funny to me ?
really funny ?
people like you think you can just buy people like me .
but guess what .
i wouldn' t walk into your shit storm for any price .
any chance there might have been that i' d go back went bye bye when you tried to pay me off .
menus ?
i' m sorry .
there' s been a mistake .
i wouldn' t want you to buy me dinner .
because then i would be exploiting you .
good night .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to insult you .
you insulted yourself .
you made your play .
we' re finished .
i would make any play to save lewis' s life .
i know you care about that .
don' t let my nickname fool you .
it' s a bastardisation of my name , volgecherev .
i keep my mouth shut and my head down .
but i do wish lewis luck .
i appreciate your concern for his wellbeing .
but i am persistent .
that' s great .
don' t waste it on me .
you' ve only got a few days left .
you' re appealing to emotions i don' t have and morality i can' t afford .
that doesn' t change the fact that a man' s life hangs in the balance .
good night .
how' re you doin ' , man ?
what' s up , sheriff ?
how' re you doin ' , tony ?
yep .
here we are .
look , i' m freezing .
yeah .
my secretary' s out today .
i apologise for the inconvenience .
you' il have to seat yourself .
so this is the office , huh ?
let' s just sort this out without that lawyer breathing down our necks .
she' s pretty intense , huh ?
no shit , man .
after she ambushed me , i couldn' t eat for two days .
my girlfriend forced some toast down my throat this morning .
i threw it up .
that' s kind of a dry run for our next three years in penang prison .
so you' re gonna do this ?
you' re going back ?
no .
you don' t give a shit , do you ?
you think i don' t care about lewis ?
that' s what you' re acting like .
you don' t know the first thing about me .
fine .
all right .
then how come you' re so ready to slam the door on him ?
i know something about guys who have clubs and badges .
i' ve had my ass kicked by those bastards .
it' s not how you think .
doing something good doesn' t mean there' il be a happy ending .
you could very easily die over there .
yeah .
you think of that ?
this is the other side of the coin .
if this goes down , god forbid , and lewis hangs , you don' t think this is gonna be headline news ?
sheriff , this is gonna follow you around the rest of your life .
whereas the other way we come home heroes and the city throws us a parade ?
tony , you' re a fucking boy scout .
you really are .
listen to me , ok ?
lewis would have gone back for either of us .
you know that .
that' s why i' il never be mistaken for lewis mcbride .
afternoon , miss eastern .
thank you .
beth eastern ?
hi .
i' m mj major , a reporter for the new york examiner .
you' re a what ?
a reporter .
really ?
and what would you want with me ?
come on , beth .
i know the hanging' s in less than a week .
press is exactly what you and the family need for a public outcry .
the family wants this kept quiet .
really ?
in this instance , your interests and the interests of the public converge .
how did you find out about this ?
my sources at the state department .
there' s a blackout at the state department .
they passed the buck .
they sold it as diplomacy .
that' s why you need me , and fast .
i can make this happen fast .
in 48 hours , lewis mcbride can be ...
no .
listen to me .
do you remember singapore ?
the american kid who graffitied a car ?
because of the media frenzy , they had to cane the kid .
that was a caning .
to show some national backbone .
this is a hanging .
i know that .
some aussie dope dealer' s mother went on every talk show from sydney to london .
you know what happened ?
they hung her son a week early to shut her up .
excuse me , i' ve got a really big week .
beth , i can make miracles happen in a week .
don' t do this .
don' t do it .
wait a minute .
why ...
what ?
jesus christ !
i' m sorry .
i' m very sorry .
just ...
can i have that , please ?
is he boyish ?
what ?
is he cute ?
is he clean cut ?
cos if i put him on the front page ...
give me some time .
give me some time , some space , and i' il give you your story .
when ?
soon .
i' m gonna call you , beth .
what are you doing here ?
i have a tape i want you to watch .
yeah ?
jesus christ , you don' t let up , do you ?
i can' t .
you know what ?
i' m gonna watch this .
honest to god i am .
but i was actually gonna go get something to eat .
so i' il watch it later .
are you inviting me to dinner , or are we still mad at each other ?
both .
cheers .
cheers .
it' s a toast to lewis .
sweet guy .
loved the animals .
loved his beer .
did he ?
he did .
i never knew that about him .
tell me something else .
beer is all i really remember .
that' s it ?
yeah .
wow .
he didn' t leave an impression then .
lewis ?
are you kidding me ?
have you spent a lot of time with him ?
i' ve never had a beer with him .
he is , honestly , beth , one of the sweetest people i' ve ever met .
lewis is the kind of guy ...
you' d have a beggar on the street , and he' d just ... he' d touch them somehow , talk to them .
the guy could have an illness , language barrier , whatever it was .
he just could see people , i guess .
got a big heart .
yeah .
that' s nice .
what else can you tell me about him ?
you are good , aren' t you ?
oh , sheriff , what do you think about me ?
i don' t know .
you seem to think i have all these wiles and stratagems .
i don' t .
i have a man' s life in my hands .
i get that .
but let me ask you a question , beth .
and ask yourself this honestly .
would you go back ?
i wouldn' t ask you or tony to do this if i hadn' t already answered the question for myself .
yeah .
but i guess , you know , i don' t think you could ever honestly answer that unless you were in that situation yourself .
hi , gaby .
i' m not a piece of dirt you get off on then flush down the john , all right ?
he' il fuck you and then sneak out , by the fire escape if he has to .
unless you don' t give a shit .
unless you' re some whore .
i' m his wife .
what ?
fuck you for not wearing a ring .
that' s my friend gaby .
wow .
good thing you didn' t give her a social disease .
we' d all be dead .
thanks , frank .
i appreciate it .
so when did you guys tie the knot ?
you know what , frank ?
get the hell outta here , will you ?
ok ?
yeah .
well , that was fun .
that was something .
i' m his wife . " i like that one .
i' m his wife .
thanks .
you left this on the table .
please watch it .
i will , beth .
i will .
good night .
ok .
ok , lewis , go ahead .
um ...
hey , guys .
sheriff .
tony .
long time , huh ?
i guess if you' re seeing this tape you' ve kind of figured that my vacation plans ... changed .
i was set to go off and try and save the orang utan , do what i can .
kind of ironic , isn' t it ?
look who' s caged and ... they say soon to be extinct .
um ... this little docudrama here was not my idea .
i' m sorry , but , um ... the folks at the american citizen service have done all they can and now they tell me that you guys are my last chance .
so ...
i don' t know if you' re even thinking about coming back .
but if there' s the slightest chance , i will tell you this .
um ...
i haven' t been . uh ... harmed in any way .
i haven' t been tortured ... except by boredom and hunger .
there' s not a whole lot of good stuff to eat .
no burgers for you , sheriff .
but , uh ...
there' s rice .
plenty of rice .
your rice needs definitely will be met .
but , um ...
if you do ...
if you do come back ,
i will feel guilty , yes , and ...
i already do , just for asking you .
but ... at least i won' t feel the fear , and i know that' s not fair .
um ... so that' s why i' m doing this .
hey !
i' m busy !
can' t take you today .
yeah , well , i can' t take you either .
pop , remember that trip i took a couple of years back , to malaysia ?
yeah , i remember .
some sleaze was selling frequent flyer miles , right ?
that' s not the point .
the point is this guy is still over there in penang .
he' s kind of a pal .
but anyway , they' re gonna hang him .
they found some hashish on him .
but some of the hash was mine .
so if i go back there ,
i' d have to serve three years in prison , penang prison .
but if i don' t go back , they hang this guy .
they don' t hang guys for hashish .
i' m not that naive .
you' re leaving something out .
i' m not leaving anything out , dad .
that' s the way it is over there .
all right .
so maybe you' re right and i' m wrong .
you still want my advice in this hanging stuff ?
yeah .
it feels like an easy call .
if you weren' t wasting your life here , it might be different .
but this pal you' il save , odds are he' s worth more than you .
so my advice , you go , you do the time .
what' s the matter ?
you look sick .
you' re my dad .
you' re supposed to beg me not to go back .
it' s just not what i expected to hear , i guess .
lighten up .
i' m just yanking your crank .
why put yourself through the agony when you know you' re not going ?
i mean , who' s kidding who ?
what are we , suckers here ?
no , they did what ?
they weighed him ?
for what ?
jesus .
uh ... [ phone rings ]
uh ...
i ...
i have to get my other ...
i have to get the call .
um ...
it might be one of the guys .
we' il talk tomorrow ?
um ...
this ... this is beth .
beth , hi .
you sound stressed .
this is mj major .
is this a bad time ?
no .
no , it' s not a bad time .
beth , what' s wrong ?
how can i help ?
you know ...
you want to know how you can help ?
just leave me alone , mj .
just leave me alone .
i' ve got the resources to a daily paper with worldwide readership .
we are picked up by the international herald trib .
we could be doing anything you want .
photographs , articles , petitions ...
every single one a death warrant , mj .
a death warrant .
now , i' ve asked you nicely to stay out of this until after the hearing .
if i don' t get something from you soon , i' il go straight to your two guys .
you don' t know who they are , or you' d already be there .
i' m hanging up .
beth , i' m gonna need to hear from you very soon .
you will .
sheriff .
well , hi .
i didn' t expect to see you .
come on in .
thanks .
how are you doing ?
couldn' t be better .
yeah ?
please give me some good news .
are you , um ...
did you get my message about dinner ?
yeah , i got your message but i can' t make dinner .
i got plans .
but i did want to return this to you .
the tape .
uh ...
ok .
did you watch it ?
yeah , i watched the whole thing .
and , um ...
i did a lot of soul searching last night with this .
and i figure you' ve got to know sooner than later because of everything .
i just wanted to come and let you know where you stand with me .
that' s good .
where do i stand with you ?
i talked to tony and he said ...
he' s halfway to penang already .
i think he just needs a nudge .
i think he' il probably go back .
but , um ...
you know , i looked inside , deep inside , beth , to find something , but , uh ... it isn' t in me .
oh , it isn' t ... in you .
jot that down .
do me a favour ?
write that down for me .
just a few words .
i' d love to give them to lew before he hangs .
letter from a pal .
listen , i ... " searched my soul " was the best part for me .
i don' t know .
that' s great .
he' d love to know that you searched your soul before you decided not to go .
yeah .
they just told me that they weighed lewis today for the trap doors of the gallows .
beth ...
get out of here .
get the fuck out of here , sheriff .
sheriff is here .
what do you say ?
how' re you doing ?
i thought you had plans .
i did .
a thing at lincoln center .
you know what i mean ?
but here i am .
ready to discuss .
what did i order ?
sheriff , this is kerrie , my fiance .
kerrie , john volgecherev .
kerrie , nice to meet you .
you' re not as platinum as i expected you to be .
listen , sheriff ...
it' s pretty obvious that you have no intention of going back , right ?
where ?
is he drunk ?
oh , you mean , like , back to prison .
right , well , i' ve never actually been .
do you have a fork i could use ?
i' ve never been to prison , thus , i can' t go back to somewhere i' ve never been .
thank you .
that is brilliantly unhelpful .
yes .
beth , i checked .
penang prison is at a third world level of sanitation , nutrition , rice rations don' t meet minimum ...
lewis is provided with food from amnesty international .
so would tony be .
inmates have been tortured .
he hasn' t been .
inmates have died of typhus .
because of overcrowding .
lewis has his own cell , as would tony , and sheriff if he goes back .
that' s really good .
and the other thing i think you' ve overlooked is that that building' s not up to code .
oh , jesus .
what are you , the class clown ?
and who are you to tell them to give up their freedom ?
i represent a boy sentenced to death .
right .
for the sake of some client , you demand ...
demand ?
no , no , no .
i don' t demand .
i have not demanded anything . ... that they endure three or six years of god knows what .
that' s insane .
yeah , it' s insane , ok ?
i' m gonna go back .

ok ?
i' m sorry , honey .
in the middle of this , what matters ?
that lewis doesn' t die .
somebody' s got to do something .
please .
where' s the document that guarantees this deal ?
the attorney general of malaysia has agreed ...
so where is it ?
why don' t we have a copy ?
it' s an oral agreement .
no .
tony goes nowhere till we have that document .
they don' t work that way .
i wish they did .
i cannot get anything to you in writing .
don' t .
i' il be at home if you want me .
sorry , tony .
i' m sorry .
she' s just scared , all right ?
she' s more scared than i am .
you' re gonna have to excuse me .
if i' m gonna get her to wait three years for me ...
i guess six ...
i shouldn' t keep her waiting tonight .
tony , what can i say ?
thank you .
sure .
all right , tony .
see you , man .
see you later .
good luck with that .
right , sheriff .
i' il go talk to the firm .
well , quite a party .
are you gonna go back to your hotel ?
oh , yes .
gotta call penang .
give them the good news .
so i guess lew' s gonna be ok then , huh ?
which means , you know ...
you' re off the hook ?
i' m off the hook , huh ?
good night .
jaffe , i want a follow up on the canarsie fire .
nice of you to join us , ravitch .
it' s my pleasure .
i' d like some pictures of the shopkeeper , burnt out .
you got it .
mj , where' s my pension fund fraud ?
i thought you had a cpa who was ready to talk .
i did .
and she' s given me gold .
i' m just fact checking a few points .
and i' m looking for a source called sheriff .
ring anybody' s bell ?
sheriff ?
ok .
let' s go , then .
yeah ?
hi .
it' s beth .
i talked to the garage and they said you called in sick .
can i come up and see you ?
uh ... sure .
hi .
hi there .
hi there .
i brought some goodies from zabar' s .
jewish penicillin .
cure you right up .
isn' t that nice ?
should i beware of lawyers bearing gifts ?
think i' m gonna have a beer .
do you want one ?
uh ... beer ?
sure .
you' re quite the avid reader , aren' t you ?
or is this just ...
yeah , just for showing off .
all the visitors i have .
i keep my place real impressive , don' t i ?
it' s nice .
the books are a recent development .
when i was in school , i tried to avoid reading .
then i graduate and realise i don' t know shit .
yeah .
who does ?
you know what i mean ?
so anyway , i start getting the books and ... do some reading , learn about the world around me .
just trying to be civilised i guess , beth .
that' s good .
lewis said you were better than you thought you were .
a lot of them are pop up books .
colouring .
that kind of thing .
where' s your passport ?
what ?
i just want to see your passport .
in case it' s not good .
i can renew it tomorrow on an emergency basis if you decide something different .
so when you said about me being off the hook , you were just lying to my face ?
i think you were lying to yourself .
come on , sheriff .
only a total bastard would let tony go back alone .
yeah , well , i' m not in charge of tony .
i' m not his dad .
i know that .
but tony' s a man who' s got ...
tony' s a great guy .
but he' s got a future and a sexy fiance .
yeah .
six years under any circumstances would be hard as hell , but this case , it' s inconceivable .
i think tony' s a man of his word .
tony called me three days ago and told me that he couldn' t do six years .
i know what he said last night .
i applaud his idealism .
but ...
i can' t count on it .
i have to have you on that plane , sheriff .
please show me your passport .
no that it' s any of your business , but my passport' s good .
it is ?
show it to me .
take my word for it .
show it to me .
you' d take three years from me but you wouldn' t take my word ?
ok .
all right .
i pushed it .
i' m sorry .
i trust you .
you know what ?
come on .
you' re gonna go for me if you don' t have a client ?
what are you talking about ?
wh ...
what ?
you offer me money and i don' t take that so you figure , " why don' t i fuck the guy cos then he' il do what i want .
that' s exactly me .
that' s actually exactly me .
i' il get you to go back because i' il give you a little sex .
that' s me .
go fuck yourself .
whoo !
that' s fun .
i' m the guy who' s gotta clean up .
that' s fun .

this story is about to blow wide open , ok ?
i found this story first , i' m gonna print it first , period .
your story could cost lewis' s life .
do you understand that ?
you give me three days three days until the hearing is over , ok ?
you promise me that you will not talk to a soul and that i have lewis exclusively .
exclusive .
you promise me you' re gonna hold off on the story .
three days , beth .
slow down , driver .
you' re making me nervous .
i' m sorry , sir .
it' s a bad habit i got .
i was all mellowed out but you fucked that up .
i hope you' re not gonna say i can' t smoke .
it' s the only place left in town you can smoke .
what the fuck are you doing ?
smoking crack ?
crack is for our african american brethren .
this is pure rock cocaine .
if you don' t like it , driver , you can raise the partition .
i can ?
whatever you want to do .
you want to see what i want to do ?
huh ?
cocksucker .
what do you want ?
i want to see you .
ok .
what' s happening here , beth ?
you tell me , sheriff .
i' m not sure but i know that i just ...
i can' t take this any more .
so don' t take it .
what do you want ?
oh , my god .
you' re killing me , beth .
i' m killing you ?
you' re killing me .
sheriff ?
oh , shit .
sheriff , are you there ?
i was just gonna say that i hope that , um ... you don' t think last night was about ...

do you wanna , um ...
do you want to switch with us ?
yeah , do you want to switch seats ?
no , i like my seat .
it' s fine .
sheriff , i' m a big boy .
i don' t need somebody to hold my hand .
ok .
all right .
at least until we get over the philippines .
come on , move it , man !
let' s go !
whoo !

woo hoo !
yes !
maybe we should all wash up , meet in a half hour or so .

i' m right here .
all right , man .
hi .
sheriff ...
what' s the matter ?
what' s wrong ?
um ...
what ?
i' m gonna miss you .
i' m gonna miss you .
they won' t bend .
only one visitor allowed in there .
one at a time ?
no , only one today .
oh , great .
what do you want to do ?
do you mind if i go back there and see him ?
no .
no , you go .
are you sure ?
go ahead .
tell him i' il see him soon .
ok .
can you come back here ?
i hear you .
lew ?
lewis ?
sheriff ?
yeah .
didn' t they tell you i was coming ?
i was praying .
i thought you were a dream cos no prayer of mine' s ever been answered here before .
yeah ?
i sure as hell ain' t a dream .
i' il tell you that .
it' s good to see you .
it' s good to see you .
you too !
how are you , man ?
i' m better now .
that' s good .
that' s good .
how are you ?
i' m all right , man .
you look good .
nice .
nice .
spiff on .
you' ve come so far .
are you thirsty ?
do you want some tea ?
i can make some tea .
all right .
yeah .
let' s have some tea .
it' s not warm or anything but ...
it' s ok .
you' re not cold , are you ?
nah , i' m not cold .
no ?
tony is here to see you too .
he' s outside .
you see , they took away my blanket .
why did they take your blanket away ?
cos they were scared that i was gonna tear it into strips to hang myself .
i said , " hey , guys , what do you think i' m paying you for ?
thank you , man .
that' s good tea .
i know why tony didn' t come in here .
i know .
cos there' s no god in here .
they only let one visitor in at a time .
that' s why i pray now , sheriff .
i ...
cos ...
out there there' s no need to ... to pray where where where god' s hand is felt .
you know ?
where god is apparent ?
but in here there' s definitely a need to to pray , t t t to beg , to plead , to sing for ... for a sign like ...
you know how ...
you know how ... how your voice sounds so pretty in the shower ?
because ... because there' s nothing else there .
because it echoes off the walls and it sounds so pretty .
that' s why prayer sounds so perfect in here .
because it' s so ...
because it' s so totally empty .
because it' s so ... it' s so godless .
it' s ...
it' s so void of ... of anything .
and do you know how i know , sheriff ?
do you know how i know ?
i know because ... because i ...
i ask myself ... would i come back for you ?
and the only answer is a godless empty evil " no .
i' m sorry i wouldn' t have come back !
i' m sorry .
don' t be .
it' s ok .
because i didn' t come back just for you .
i didn' t come back just for you , you know ?
it' s all right .
man , it' s ok .
do you know what i mean ?
come here .
it' s ok .
ok , man .
ok .
i' m gonna see you in a couple hours , all right ?
all right ?
thanks for the tea .
i liked that .
see you in a couple of hours .
you' il be cleaned up .
it' il be good .
sheriff .
yeah ?
i knew you' d come back .
even if you didn' t .
thank you .
so how bad was it ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know how bad it was .
it was not good .
what wasn' t good , the prison or lewis ?
the prison sucks , for sure .
it' s dirty , it' s scary , it' s third world .
how' s lewis ?
is he sick ?
is he all there mentally ?
is he the same guy we used to know ?
i don' t think he' s lost his mind , but it' s not easy sitting around a cell waiting to hang .
yeah .
what did he say ?
did he tell you anything ?
he just babbled a little bit , tone .
you know , like , rambled a little bit , you know ?
like stream of consciousness stuff .
god' s not in here .
there' s no god in here .
the sound' s beautiful , like singing in the shower .
basically you' re saying he lost it .
he' s hanging onto anything he possibly can .
no one' s questioning his courage .
but his sanity ?
you want a way out ?
find one .
but lewis has always talked that way .
how do ...
what do you mean , always ?
you' re only his lawyer .
you' ve known him for two years .
24 years .
i' m his sister .
what ?
he' s my baby brother .
why didn' t you tell me ?
i thought you wouldn' t trust me , sheriff .
i thought you' d think i' d do anything , that i' d say ... say anything , that i' d sell you out , that i' d ...
i wanted to ...
i wanted to tell you .
i tried to tell you .
but you didn' t tell me .
but you didn' t tell me .
sheriff ?
what are we still doing here ?
i wish it was that simple , tony .
i think it' s that simple .
i came back here based on what she told me , ok , and she gave me her word and she lied .
how are we going to trust her , sheriff ?
she drags us into this nightmare , we find out it is her personal nightmare .
a woman we don' t know from adam .
i don' t know her .
you don' t know her .
what ?
i know her .
like , know her .
don' t even ...
don' t .
fuck .
all right , i' m an asshole .
no , tony .
this time i' m the fucking asshole .
why didn' t you tell me ?
what do i owe you to tell you that ?
it' s not like it' s been going on forever .
it happened .
listen to me ...
don' t make it like i' m holding out on you because i swear to god i' m not .
all right .
listen to me , sheriff .
this girl will do anything to get you to do what she needs you to , all right ?
that' s her brother in there .
her blood .
she' il lie to you , she' il sleep with you , she' il tell you she loves you .
she' il do anything .
she' il get down on her knees and beg you .
but don' t believe it .
it' s a setup .
if we walk out of here , that boy hangs .
and if we stay maybe we hang .
but if we leave , we live .
that' s the one thing i know for sure right now .
he doesn' t have clothes ?
can' t you give him a shower before he turns up in court ?
ok .
listen .
i ...
what can i do for you , sir ?
we need two seats on any flight to new york , as fast as possible .
what , sheriff ?
what is it ?
i trashed that bike , tony .
so fucking what ?
get on the plane , sheriff .
do you want to rot in one of these prisons ?
i' m gonna take my chances , tony .
you don' t have any chances , sheriff .
don' t leave your life to fate .
this is stupid .
i don' t know , tony .
you have a safe flight .
what' s he saying ?
he says they returned but became frightened and may have left .
we request adjournment till the two can be found .
um ... he' s worried about the appearance of preferential treatment .
hey , lew .
how are you ?
my faith in humanity is half restored .
in returning voluntarily , you are to be commended for your courage .
is there anything you wish to say to this court , mr volgecherev ?
not really , your honour .
just that we were young and stupid , i guess .
but not evil .
i didn' t come back here today because i' m courageous .
i came back here because i' ve been careless for a very long time , and i' m sick of that feeling .
the simple fact , your honour , is that i am responsible .
and i' m also scared .
but i am willing to do whatever is necessary ... in order for you to spare my friend' s life .
how do you plead ?
i' m guilty .
you will be detained in penang prison to await sentence .
he asked the prosecutor if he will now reduce the charges .
the prosecutor has agreed .
chief justice will be back shortly with his decision .
beth ?
we' re back in session .
we' re back ?
yeah .
the deputy home minister is angered about some international news story .
i' m not sure what .
a story that was picked up by the asian international tribune .
in a country proud of its many species of exotic butterflies , a butterfly is about to be broken on a wheel .
the wheel is malaysian justice , a term which strikes one american woman as a cruel joke .
your honour ...
" the woman is beth mcbride ...
i didn' t do this . " ... whose brother was arrested two years ago in penang .
blamed for having bought hashish with two friends , this nature loving young man now , incredibly , faces death .
she was determined to write the story .
silence !
we know you westerners don' t understand our attitude toward drugs .
but we don' t understand yours .
your cities are decaying , the souls of your young people are stolen from you .
our laws may seem harsh but our streets remain safe and our youth is protected .
so when an american journalist criticises ourjudicial system ...
your honour , i begged her not to .
silence !
lewis mcbride ... [ continues in malay ]
what is he saying ?
what is he saying ?
he will not amend the charge now .
lewis must be hanged tomorrow .
what ?
lewis !
your honour , i came back here .
you can' t hang him !
you hang on , lewis !
beth , i love you !
get your fucking hands off me .
what is the matter with you people ?
what is the matter with you people ?
you are gonna go straight to hell , you motherfucker !
you lying son of a bitch !
goddamn it !
sheriff !
i don' t wanna die !
no !
you fucking bastards !
i don' t wanna die !
help !
lewis .
lewis !
lewis !
please let go of me !
you fucking bastards !
no !
no !
lew !
lewis !
lewis !
lewis !
lewis , goddamn it !
look up here !
sheriff !
i' m here , lewis !
i' m right here !
you' re not alone , lewis !
look at me , lewis !
you' re not alone , lewis .
look at me .
you' re not alone .
i' m here .
look at me .

you' re not alone .
i' m right here .
i' m right here , lewis .
i see you , lewis .
i' m right here .
lewis , you are not alone right now .
i' m right here .
you are not alone , lewis .
i see you .
i see you , lewis .
i' m here .
you' re not alone .
you are not alone , lewis !
right .
ok .
where am i going here ?
beth .
were you there ?
yeah .
he wasn' t afraid , beth .
he walked right past me .
and then i saw him go past all the guards and he was calm .
come on , sheriff .
tell me the truth .
it was hard .
it was hard .
but , uh ...
you know , i think that , uh ... he found , at the end , beth , at the end ...
i mean , he was lewis , you know ?
at that last second ,
i swear to god , he was at peace with everything .
he was .
i just wish i could have done something .
if i could have been there to do something .
fight harder .
you did everything you could .
nobody could have done more .
you' ve gotta believe that .
nobody did more than you did .
nobody could have done more .
you did everything you could .
you should have gone back with tony .
why didn' t you go back with tony ?
i couldn' t go back with tony .
i couldn' t go back because i knew that you were waiting for me .
and i' m not sorry , beth .
i' m not sorry right now .
i' m not .
cos if i would have went back ,
i don' t think i' d be able to look at you ever again .
and that' d be a lot harder than this shit .
you know what i mean ?
i like to look at you .
i like to look at you .
i like to look at you .
the ambassador heard through back channels that when all this publicity dies down , they' re gonna let you go , sheriff .
they' re gonna do it quietly to save face , but it' s gonna be six months , maximum .
sheriff ?
yeah .
oh , goddamn it !
oh , goddamn it !
sheriff .
i am gonna take my brother home ... and i' m coming right back here .
and i will not leave penang until you' re with me .
i know , beth .
i know .
