notice the elegance of the proof .
it' s beautiful !
if measure and symmetry are absent from any composition ,
the ruin awaits both the ingredients and the composition .
measure and symmetry are beauty and virtue the world over .
do you think he' s straight ?
yeah , he' s too boring to be gay .
15 ?
yes , it is .
thank you ...
i' m releasing you a half hour early today .
i have ... an appointment .
i' m giving a lecture on my new book tonight .
you are all welcome .
thank you .
rose , get that mask off your face .
it' il clog your pores .
you' re going to be late .
it' s almost seven o' clock .
you bum !
three million dollars a year !
for what ?
come on .
just one more out .
barry neufeld .
hi , it' s rose .
hi ...
not again .
i think it' s an allergic reaction to something i ate .
my throat' s starting to close up .
it sounds like you' re dying .
sure you' re not allergic to me ?
that' s a terrible thing to think !
every manhattan restaurant hates me for not keeping reservations .
why don' t you call me next week ?
if you still want to .
feel better .
thank you .
bye .
should i start with a joke ?
no , there' s not enough time .
for what ?
to develop a sense of humour .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , the author of " absolute truth " ,
columbia' s very own professor gregory larkin .
you' re going to be fine .
thank you .
i' m honoured by this warm and gracious welcome .
whether i am awake or asleep , two and three will always make five .
it does not seem possible that such a truth can be questioned .
this book has taken me over 14 years to write .
it is with sadness i say goodbye to it consuming my days and nights .
and nights ...
and as i stand here ...
in coming up ... summing up ...
excuse me , i' m feeling a little dizzy .
i thought it would feel differently .
i thought i' d know more .
i don' t .
i don' t know anything , really .
thank you all for coming .
what did i say ?
it was fine , though you shouldn' t work for a suicide hotline .
you did fine until candice came .
don' t start .
i just forgot to eat .
it' s natural .
she left you what , a year ago ?
thank god candy left when she did , or i' d never have finished the book .
you' re a guy who can' t have sex and chew gum at the same time .
when i' m with someone , i tend to get a little sidetracked .
14 years ?
is that sidetracked ?
i bet she' s still out there .
if i know candice , she' s out there .
she' s out there .
face her like a grown up .
don' t let me go home with her .
it would be odd not to invite ...
just don' t let me go home with her .
are you all right ?
it was the stupid wine .
hello .
you look great .
i hope you don' t mind me showing up like this on your big night .
it' s just that i' ve been thinking so much about you lately .
do you want to go get a drink ?
i' d better not .
a bite to eat ?
no , i' m not hungry .
do you want me to take you home ?
okay .
good to see you , henry .
but greg ...
don' t leave .
aren' t you staying ?
well , we' re done .
i still have feelings for you .
but i dumped you for another man .
and i' m still sort of with paul .
i thought that was over .
he cheated .
i wanted to feel better about myself before i see him .
that' s why you' re here ?
well , yeah .
you were always a nice guy .
but let' s face it ,
we' ve nothing in common except sex , and the fact you idolize me .
i really do care for you .
i just can' t wind up with you .
can i call you sometime ?
what for ?
are you going ?
no , i cancelled .
what do you want to do for dinner ?
make that pasta with artichokes .
later we can figure out what to do with your hair for claire' s wedding .
what is this ?
look at that .
the mating ritual is both speedy and violent .
the lesser male often covers the larger female .
if unsuccessful in mounting , the male is often eaten by the female .
we' re the girls of 1 400 hot talk .
felicia .
anything you want to talk about , call me ...
i don' t know where to begin .
are you lonely tonight , darling ?
so am i. what are you wearing ?
nothing special .
can i ask you a question ?
i' m just wearing a towel .
i was drying myself off , after a hot shower ...
why do women leave ?
why do they leave ?
especially pretty ones .
i can' t do it any more .
life is very complex .
there are no guarantees .
the mathematical world is completely rational .
you think too much .
don' t you want to know how big my tits are ?
no !
i just want to share my life with someone .
someone i' m not sexually attracted to .
how can two people come together in lasting respect and affection ?
the world' s run by sex ads .
take out your own ad , i guess .
an ad ?
look at me .
i' m a grown woman wearing a prom dress .
i look like an over the hill barbie doll .
and it' s too tight .
i want something in my colour .
maids of honour don' t wear black .
why aren' t you wearing make up ?
i am wearing make up .
you' d look good with a perm .
like shirley temple on crack .
where is she ?
she can' t stand that i' m getting all the attention .
we should' ve had her committed .
for excessive vanity ?
how wonderful !
two compassionate daughters .
no make up today ?
i am wearing make up .
what the hell are you wearing ?
it' s an imitation scassi .
you' re my mother , not the singer .
i' il go home and change .
stop it .
we' re late .
the priest is sweating .
all celibates sweat , dear .
if they didn' t , they' d explode .
i bought a snack .
if i sit through this without eating , i' il pass out .
it' il only take 45 minutes .
marrying outside your faith , and on the sabbath ...
all i know about the sabbath is that bergdorff' s isn' t too crowded .
i want you to remember , today is my day .
behave , or i' il blow up your birth certificate into a christmas card .
i should have never encouraged you to speak .
maybe she' il look back and turn into a pillar of salt .
alex looks nervous .
i hope i' m doing the right thing .
i think you are .
the party is about to get started .
the dance floor is all yours !
okay girls , lick your lips .
tell claire i' m looking for her .
your husband' s a lucky guy .
waiter !
can we have more dressing ?
we were separated at birth .
two more drinks , when you can .
this looks delicious .
i can' t believe he' s married .
and that he chose claire over you .
i told you not to introduce them .
she was married , i didn' t think .
how are you handling all this ?
no more fantasies of handsome men .
there' s a guy out there somewhere .
who ?
barry neufeldt ?
what' s wrong with him , other than that he looks like gumpy ?
gumby , not gumpy .
i' m no great prize , either .
you' re a great person and teacher .
i think i' ve reached the point where you know you' il never get married .
married ?
what' s marriage ?
a ring , a contract .
fighting , compromising .
it can be more than that .
you know what i envy about people in love ?
i' d love it if someone really knew me .
what i like .
what i' m afraid of .
what kind of toothpaste i use .
i think that would really be wonderful .
hey , sister in law , having a good time ?
have you seen claire ?
no , i' il find her for you .
you look beautiful tonight .
i' m not just saying that .
you really do .
i heard you .
why don' t you have some coffee ?
i' il find claire .
alex is looking for you .
brother , it' s starting already ?
how could you do this ?
i' il never forgive you .
yes ... !
i' m professor gregory larkin .
i' m calling about the response to my ad .
is this professor morgan ?
i' m her sister .
she knows nothing .
then maybe we shouldn' t talk .
no !
rose would never answer herself .
most of these guys are creeps .
but when it said you taught at columbia , something just clicked .
you have seen her picture , right ?
yes .
and ... ?
and what ?
nothing .
great .
make way , please .
this is the scene at my sister' s wedding .
she' s getting drunk , regretting that she got married for the third time .
my mom' s sprouting snakes from her hair in jealousy .
it was perfect ...
the divine whore , medusa and me .
what archetype am i ?
the virgin mary ?
thanks a lot , trevor .
no , the faithful handmaiden .
always the bridesmaid , never the bride .
it proves what jung said all along .
myths and archetypes are alive and well and living in my apartment .
as i stood beside the altar beside my sister and her husband to be ,
it struck me that this ritual , a wedding ceremony ,
is the last scene of a fairy tale .
they never say what happens after .
that cinderella drove the prince mad by obsessively cleaning the castle .
they don' t say what happens after because there is no after .
the be all and end all of romantic love was ...
mike ?
sex ?
you have sex on the brain .
marriage .
but it wasn' t always like that .
the 12th century had " courtly love " , which had nothing to do with sex .
the relationship between a knight and a married lady of the court ...
and so they could never consummate their love .
they rose above " going to the toilet in front of each other " love ,
and went after something more divine .
they took sex out of the equation , leaving them with a union of souls .
think of this .
sex was always the fatal love potion .
look at the literature of the time .
all consummation could lead to was madness , despair or death .
true love has spiritual dimensions , while romantic love is a lie .
a myth .
a soulless manipulation .
and speaking of manipulation ...
it' s like going to the movies and seeing the lovers kiss ...
the music swells , and we buy it , right ?
so when my date kisses me , and i don' t hear strings , i dump him .
the question is , why do we buy it ?
because , myth or manipulation , we all want to fall in love .
that experience makes us feel completely alive .
our everyday reality is shattered , and we are flung into the heavens .
it may only last a moment , an hour , but that doesn' t diminish its value .
we' re left with memories we treasure for the rest of our lives .
i read , " when we fall in love , we hear puccini in our heads .
i love that .
his music expresses our need for passion and romantic love .
we listen to la boheme or turandot , or read wuthering heights ,
or watch casablanca , and a little of that love lives in us too .
why do people want to fall in love
when it can have such a short run and be so painful ?
propagation of the species ?
we need to connect with somebody .
are we culturally preconditioned ?
good , but too intellectual for me .
i think it' s because , as some of you may already know ...
while it does last , it feels fucking great .
i' m almost finished , and you haven' t started yet .
the perfect bite .
you need a therapist .
do we have to have the tv on ?
can' t we have a conversation ?
i' m not intellectually stimulating , like your university people ...
i' m sorry .
how was your day , mother ?
who gives a shit ?
i said i was sorry .
let' s talk .
i' ve lived too long .
i should be dead .
give me that !
talk to me already !
all right .
you haven' t even noticed i had my hair done differently .
i thought you looked different .
it looks great .
what' s different about it ?
the ...
nothing .
you' re just like your father .
so easy to trip up .
so , how was work ?
same as always .
though i had one customer in for a make over .
she needed one .
dyed blonde hair .
blue eyeshadow .
ash brown foundation .
hideous .
she was shocked over my age .
how old were you ?
sorry .
i ran into mr. jenkins again .
he cornered me in the elevator .
he invited me to an alzheimer' s benefit .
i said forget it .
i can' t believe he still asks you .
why don' t you go with him sometime ?
no ...
i raised two daughters .
i buried a husband .
that' s my life .
i don' t want to start another .
and he knows my situation with you .
you won' t see him because of me ?
how would it look ?
the mother' s dating and the daughter stays home ?
who' s looking ?
hello ...
hi .
hello , this is ...
hello , i' m gregory larkin .
professor gregory larkin .
answer the phone .
i' m sleeping .
is professor larkin there ?
i mean , is professor morgan there ?
barely .
who' s this ?
gregory larkin .
i' m a professor in the math department at columbia .
i was just calling to see ...
how are you tonight ?
i' m fine .
how are you ?
fine .
i hope it wasn' t presumptuous of me , but i went to your class
and was very impressed .
i hoped we could eat dinner saturday .
louder !
i sat in on your class .
hold on .
don' t go away .
i was impressed by your teaching .
i was hoping we could have dinner saturday .
i can do this !
can you hear me ?
okay ...
you want to eat dinner .
i sat in on your class .
who' s on the phone ?
quiet !
no , not you .
gregory larkin .
math department .
columbia .
i saw you pass by .
i was just passing by ...
i' m sorry about calling ...
i was so confused .
are we on for saturday night ?
sure .
i' m looking forward to it .
moi aussi .
he must be good looking , for you to go to all this trouble .
i hate lipstick .
did you try the samples i brought ?
i' m not going .
oh , what do you want for dinner ?
i don' t care .
i' m upset .
can' t you see that ?
you always cancel your dates .
this is not a date .
then why does it matter how you look with this one ?
stop calling him " this one " .
and nothing' s going to happen .
you need more colour .
let me do it .
don' t make me look like a clown .
you won' t look like a clown .
where' s the hairpiece ?
shall i make you something to eat ?
make him wait .
he mustn' t think he' s the only date you' ve had in years .
where' s the bow ?
hey , your mother did you up again .
looks great !
can i get you a cab ?
sorry .
are you sure ?
you' re going to take me ?
here' s where i' m going , but don' t go until i put up the window .
they' re broke , lady .
my hair !
don' t complain to me .
complain to the cab company .
i' m sorry .
for what ?
you' re exactly on time .
my hair .
i must look like i was attacked by wolves .
i didn' t even notice .
could you excuse me while i go to the ladies ' room for a minute ?
do you enjoy dancing ?
i used to love to dance with my father .
you ?
i find it embarrassing .
i enjoy watching it .
watching ?
pairs ...
it' s interesting how coupling appears in nature and mathematics .
you were talking about pairs ...
oh , the twin prime conjecture .
it explores pairs of prime numbers .
those only divisible by themselves .
three five .
five seven .
not seven nine ...
nine can be divided by three .
that' s right .
11 13 and 17 19 and so on .
it was discovered that pairs were often separated by ...
one number in between .
exactly .
did you read my book ?
no , i' m sorry .
that' s okay .
this is marvellous .
a first date like a game show .
i didn' t mean to lecture .
i' m sorry , i didn' t mean to call it a date .
it' s just rare that i meet a person i can discuss these things with .
some pepper ?
no , not for me .
could you bring me a side dish of extra dressing ?
i don' t particularly like salad , i just like the dressing .
interesting theory .
are there still pairs like that past a million ?
i can' t believe you thought of that .
that is what is to be proven .
i have concert tickets next saturday .
can we do this again ?
sure .
great .
terrific .
what was it you wanted to discuss about my teaching ?
i have to confess .
that was just an excuse to meet you .
i hope you don' t mind .
i found it interesting .
how do you get them to stay ?
well ?
nothing .
what happened to your hair ?
don' t ask .
you won' t be seeing him again ?
we' re going out next week .
so , he must like you .
did he kiss you ?
no .
that' s kind of sweet , actually .
hi .
this is cindy .
this is a spectrum analyzer .
it makes graphic representations of the music .
watch .
who' s the girl ?
rose morgan .
henry fine is a professor in anthropology .
beautiful music , isn' t it ?
beautiful atmosphere .
i enjoyed that .
thank you so much for inviting me .
why don' t you come up ?
i' d like to give you a copy of my book .
i' d love that .
your book , i mean .
not to come up to your apartment .
but rose , i' m inviting you .
if you like this kind of music , i have some wonderful cd' s , but ... ... they' re also in my apartment .
i have to be honest with you .
i' m a bit out of practice with this .
i want you to feel comfortable .
that' s important to me .
i want to tell you upfront .
i' m not interested in sex .
you' re not ?
and it has nothing to do with you .
it has to do with what you were talking about in your class .
i , too , believe it' s illusions about love and the emphasis on sex
that separate people today .
as you said , romance is a myth .
i was referring to academic opinions that are purely subjective .
you were right !
relationships based on romantic love are worthless .
did you stay for my whole class ?
i left when you mentioned the music we hear when lovers kiss in films .
it is manipulative !
in real life , we don' t hear music when we kiss .
and the person you' re with isn' t a movie star .
it' s a malicious ...
fantasy ?
is it all right if i sit down for a minute ?
the addiction to beauty and perfection created by advertising
feeds on people' s pathetic hopes .
they don' t have their own opinions .
the media tells us what' s beautiful .
tv shows tell us what a relationship is supposed to be like .
and sex !
i don' t even want to tell you how that' s ruined my life ...
well , i go crazy .
when i want someone sexually , i go out of my mind .
do you remember that film where the woman kills the bunny ?
" fatal attraction " ?
granted , it was a film .
but i understand how she felt .
not that i would kill an animal ,
but i know the feeling of wanting someone so much that it hurts .
this fiction , known as love , drives people crazy , as you said .
then you' re either mad , alone ...
or dead .
but that was fiction .
right !
we' re dead !
i do believe two people can come together , even marry ,
for reasons more concrete than sex .
a love that grows out of respect , love , trust , common interest .
have you noticed that friendships last longer than marriages ?
the 12th century was on to something .
would you like coffee ?
got any scotch ?
yeah .
are you busy this week ?
i was hoping you could help me with my teaching .
you give yourself too little credit .
maybe you could sit in on one of my classes .
if x squared plus y squared equals 16 ,
how do we find d yld x as an implicit function of x and y ?
well , y is a function of x ...
you walk across the room like this , and you' re into your own thing .
your body language is very detached , very alienating .
i think you have to relate more to the kids .
you' re up there with your back to the room , solving your own problems .
it' s like you' re having a math party , and only invited yourself .
relax .
loosen up .
have some fun .
relax .
have fun ...
what else ?
loosen up .
put the pen down , i' m not going to test you on this .
come on .
teach me something .
if a ball is thrown up into the air , and its height , h , equals 100 t ...
what are you doing ?
turn around .
talk to me .
if t is time in seconds , at what limit is the speed ...
you lost me .
you have to put it in context .
jazz it up , put some humour in it .
humour in calculus ?
well , try telling a story .
a story ?
once upon a time ... ... there was a ball .
it was thrown into the air .
and its height ...
maybe i should just write books .
no one understands those , either .
just kidding .
don' t give up .
try it again .
tell you another story ?
hi , professor larkin ...
sorry .
that' s all right .
do we have an appointment ?
actually , i wanted to make one .
could you come back tomorrow ?
after class ?
my head is swimming .
it' s hot .
put your head between your legs .
pretty girl .
with all that make up ?
you don' t wear any , do you ?
i' d still look like me , only in colour .
you' re too smart for that .
you' re a confident , no nonsense woman .
i sound like an airline .
i' m probably saying it wrong .
it' s just that you don' t need any of that .
thanks .
how' s your head ?
i think food will help you .
pizza , maybe ?
where can we go ?
dancing ?
why did i say that ?
there' s that great dessert place .
all delicious things are fattening .
my mother would kill me .
what is that , danish ?
this is the one .
trees are fascinating .
they don' t have to touch to propagate .
you would find that fascinating ...
how many do i need ?
one , two , three , four ...
why didn' t i see that ?
thank you .
i owe you one .
it' s right in front of your eyes .
six and a five .
i got you .
the pretzel !
you can have mine .
you sounded excited on the phone .
i' m going to take my theory of love as a man made cultural creation
and expand it to include the biological effect on the individual .
you need a hobby .
i can' t believe you' ve dated for three months and haven' t kissed !
i can' t believe you' ve dated for three months and haven' t kissed !
how do you say hello ?
well , we nod .
it works .
you mean you haven' t even touched ?
i fell once , and he picked me up .
we talk a lot .
that' s what we do .
and i don' t worry about what i say , what i wear , what i eat ...
it' s a relief to eat with a man , and not worry that he' il be frightened .
he' s fun to be with .
maybe " fun " isn' t the word .
he' s interesting .
how many men can you say that about ?
is a tie too personal a gift ?
are you using it on something other than his neck ?
does he look good in vests ?
why do you want him to meet your mother ?
i kept saying i was a great cook , so i offered him a birthday dinner .
now i need something nice .
after meeting her , i won' t see him again .
i' m starving .
can we eat ?
i can' t , i have a date .
find a gift for dr. strangelove .
who ?
we should get you some blush .
i' m hungry , claire .
fruit .
why are you so grumpy ?
if he wasn' t gorgeous , rich and straight , i wouldn' t have bothered .
i' m sick to death of the man i am bound to for eternity .
why are you saying that ?
no matter where i go , what i do , there he is .
in the kitchen , on the phone , on my finger .
i was asleep the other night .
when i wake up , he' s staring at me .
i think that' s sweet .
i think it' s strange .
do you know how weird that makes me feel ?
a lesbian dream , and he' s staring at me like i should include him .
i can' t even fantasize in private .
mom said you' ve been seeing someone steady .
is he cute ?
what ?
what are you doing here ?
i thought i' d meet you for coffee .
is that a terrible thing to do ?
excuse me .
i' m going to the ladies ' room .
alone .
can you believe this weather ?
it' s almost april and it' s still cold .
i' m glad i have you alone .
can i ask you a question ?
lt' il sound strange , but ...
is claire happy ?
i mean , do you think she' s happy ?
yes , i think she is .
why ?
i' m being silly .
i' m a first time husband .
if she doesn' t wake up and tell me she' s ecstatic , i worry .
imagine , i have you to thank for the fact that we' re married .
you made this possible .
knowing you has changed my life .
don' t do that .
what ?
what am i doing ?
you don' t even know , do you ?
rose ...
just tell claire i had to run .
rose , i' m sorry .
i really thought i was over him .
i hate this .
it' s so stupid .
i must sound so pathetic .
he asked if claire was happy , and i lied .
isn' t that awful ?
nothing criminal .
thanks for coming so quickly .
are you feeling better now ?
a little .
you know , rose , it takes time .
yeah , i know .
i want you to know our friendship really means a lot to me .
i feel the same way , which is why tonight ...
i better go home , i have to get dinner ready .
i' il see you at eight .
shall i bring anything for your mother ?
yeah , a wooden stake and a crucifix .
rose loves to fold napkins .
it' s one of her idiosyncracies .
i came home late and threw this on .
god knows how i look .
i hope you like it .
my god , rose , it' s art !
it' s not art .
an artist isn' t only one who paints .
it' s one who sets the table ,
prepares a meal , or teaches in a certain way .
you' re an artist .
why didn' t you use the limoges ?
may i serve you ?
rose !
my hands are clean .
we go to all this trouble , and rose and i don' t eat very much .
i' ve always thought she had a very healthy appetite .
i can' t stand women who eat two bites and say they' re full .
do you really need extra salt ?
you know how it retains water .
can i have some ?
and potatoes .
you don' t need them .
have you ever sat in on one of your daughter' s lectures ?
rose !
that' s the best part .
rose tells me you' ve never been married .
that' s all right , rose .
that' s true , mrs. morgan .
i guess i haven' t found the right girl .
i' ve had relationships that haven' t worked out , but that will change .
really ?
why ?
as i told rose , i have a theory about love ...
and sex .
does anybody want coffee ?
what theory ?
regular or decaf ?
regular .
i can make cappuccinos .
would you like cappuccinos ?
greg , why don' t you help me .
why don' t you put the coffee on ?
i made dinner .
you put it on .
i' ve raised two daughters , buried a husband , i' ve made my coffee .
alone at last .
i' ve heard a lot about you .
and i' ve heard a lot about you .
you' ve been seeing a lot of my daughter .
i hope you don' t mind my asking ...
what are your intentions ?
my intentions ?
what a lovely meal !
you' re a good cook .
i didn' t oversell myself ?
not at all , but the trouble ...
of course i had to go to the trouble .
it was your birthday .
what are friends for , but to give each other presents and stuff ...
happy birthday .
open it up !
i really hope you like it .
dice ?
they once were dice .
now they' re cuff links with ...
prime numbers !
they' re great !
how' d you do that ?
i had them made just for you .
they were done very fast .
thank you .
well ...
i' ve wanted to ask you something , and i can only say this once ...
sit down .
we have a lot in common .
some variables will remain unknown ,
as is the case with most complex equations ...
greg , talk to me .
i' m not saying this right .
this feeling you have for alex ...
it won' t be the same with me .
you won' t have that ache in your stomach , because we' re not in love .
i think we share a genuine affection for each other .
we share a passion for knowledge rather than a physical passion .
although , if sex is something that interests you ,
i' m sure i could provide that on occasion , given enough warning .
what are you saying ?
we were in love and miserable .
it' s a waste , because as people , we' re valuable .
when i look at you , i see a woman unlike any other i' ve known before .
your mind , your humour , your passion for ideas .
i' m very fond of you .
when i' m with you , i feel as if ... ... as if i' m home .
so i think we should get married .
people marry for sex or beauty .
are my reasons more insane than those ?
are you in shock , or just appalled ?
blink if you can hear me .
why are you laughing ?
i' m sorry .
this sounds silly , but i was just thinking ...
how could i marry someone that i' ve never even ...
you know ...
... kissed .
there' s one thing i have to say .
i promised your sister i wouldn' t .
you love claire , too ?
you just slept with her ?
you want to ?
i don' t even know her .
it' s about how i found you .
i wrote this ad ...
i think that' s kind of great .
i thought you' d be upset .
why ?
you picked me .
actually , i found you through this charming woman on tv ...
well , well , well ...
so ?
gregory just proposed to me .
do you need a valium ?
i know you don' t respect my opinion , but i don' t trust him .
i mean , where' s the attraction ?
he' s not attracted to me .
he doesn' t want sex .
he wants to be companions .
what sane person would agree to that kind of marriage ?
it' s not natural .
are claire and alex natural ?
he wants me , mother !
he wants you to cook and clean !
he found you through an ad .
i already know , mom .
sorry .
it' s not your average proposal , but let' s face it ,
they' re not standing in line for me .
and we like each other !
then say yes !
i can live alone .
if you think such a marriage is normal , then go ahead .
why do you do that ?
why do you make it sound so pathetic ?
you had a life .
a husband who adored you .
can' t i have some of that ?
i' m getting older , too .
why can' t you be happy for me ?
but you can' t , can you ?
you' re scared to death of being alone .
and you' re jealous .
jealous because a man wants me .
a good looking man .
how ridiculous !
well , you know something , mom ?
a man does .
today , gregory larkin and rose morgan have exchanged rings
and agreed to recognise each other as equals .
they shall seek a life of kindness and understanding .
the ceremony of marriage is a means of establishing a home .
and as you have exchanged vows before witnesses ,
by the authority vested in me , i pronounce you husband and wife .
congratulations !
she' s a great ...
yes .
i' ve heard so much about you .
likewise , about you .
we all ought to ...
had i known you were this handsome , i' d have answered the ad myself .
congratulations .
she' s the best .
if i were a man , i' d be all over her .
congratulations .
i' m sure you' il both be very fascinating to watch .
rose , isn' t it amazing how many books you accumulate over the years ?
i know what you mean .
i can' t believe it .
and the dust !
this place needs a good cleaning .
we' il take care of that .
i made room for your books .
need any help ?
everything' s put in its place .
what would you like to do ?
go to bed .
to sleep ...
in order to sleep .
you go to the bed for sleeping .
do you want to do something else ?
what ?
i wasn' t going to say anything .
do you want the bathroom first ?
no , i can wait .
no , you go .
please .
your turn .
tired ?
not really .
me neither .
these are nice .
you want to watch some tv ?
sure .
i have some old movies .
it happened one night " , " lawrence of arabia " , " now , voyager " ?
how about " lawrence of arabia " ?
it' s nice and long .
okay .
lawrence of arabia " it is .
