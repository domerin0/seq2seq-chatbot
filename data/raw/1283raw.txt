starling !
starling !
crawford wants to see you in his office .
thank you , sir .
clarice .
hey .
you looking for crawford ?
he should be back in a minute .
wait in his office .
starling .
clarice m. good morning .
morning , mr crawford .
sorry to pull you off the course at such short notice .
your instructors tell me you' re doing well .
i hope so .
they haven' t posted any grades yet .
a job' s come up and i thought about you .
not a job , really .
more of an interesting errand .
sit down .
yes , sir .
i remember you from my seminar at uva .
you grilled me pretty hard , as i recall , on the bureau' s civil rights record in the hoover years .
i gave you an a.
a minus , sir .
double major : psych and criminology .
graduated magna .
summer internships at the reitzinger clinic .
it says , when you graduate , you wanna work for me in behavioural science .
yes , very much , sir .
very much .
we' re interviewing all serial killers now in custody for a psycho behavioural profile .
could be a real help in unsolved cases .
most of them have been happy to talk to us .
do you spook easily , starling ?
not yet , sir .
see , the one we want most refuses to cooperate .
i want you to go after him again today in the asylum .
who' s the subject ?
the psychiatrist , hannibal lecter .
hannibal the cannibal .
i don' t expect him to talk to you .
but i have to be able to say we tried .
so if he won' t cooperate , i want just straight reporting .
how does he look ?
how does his cell look ?
is he sketching , drawing ?
if he is , what' s he sketching ?
here' s a dossier on lecter .
a copy of our questionnaire and a special id for you .
have your memo on my desk by 0800 wednesday .
ok .
excuse me , sir , but why the urgency ?
lecter' s been in prison for so many years .
is there some connection between him and buffalo bill maybe ?
i wish there were .
now , i want your full attention , starling .
yes , sir .
be very careful with hannibal lecter .
dr chilton at the asylum will go over all the physical procedures used with him .
do not deviate from them for any reason whatsoever .
and you' re to tell him nothing personal .
believe me , you don' t want hannibal lecter inside your head .
just do your job , but never forget what he is .
and what is that ?
oh , he' s a monster .
a pure psychopath .
so rare to capture one alive .
from a research point of view , lecter is our most prized asset .
we get a lot of detectives here , but i can' t ever remember one as attractive .
will you be in baltimore overnight ?
because this can be quite a fun town if you have the right guide .
i' m sure this is a great town , dr chilton , but my instructions are to talk to dr lecter and report back this afternoon .
i see .
well , let' s make this quick , then .
we' ve tried to study him , but he' s much too sophisticated for the standard tests .
oh , my , does he hate us !
he thinks i' m his nemesis .
crawford' s very clever , isn' t he , using you ?
what do you mean , sir ?
a pretty , young woman to turn him on .
i don' t believe lecter' s seen a woman in eight years .
and are you ever his taste !
so to speak .
i graduated from uva , doctor .
it' s not a charm school .
good .
then you should be able to remember the rules .
do not touch or approach the glass .
you pass him nothing but soft paper .
no pencils or pens .
no staples or paperclips in his paper .
use the sliding food carrier .
if he attempts to pass you anything , do not accept it .
do you understand me ?
yes , i understand , sir .
i' m going to show you why we insist on such precautions .
on july 8 , 1981 , he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary .
his restraints were removed for an ekg .
when the nurse leaned over him , he did this to her .
the doctors managed to reset her jaw , more or less , save one of her eyes .
his pulse never got above 85 , even when he ate her tongue .
i keep him in here .
dr chilton .
if lecter feels that you' re his enemy , then maybe we' il have more luck if i go in by myself .
what do you think ?
you might have suggested this in my office and saved me the time .
yes , sir , but then i would have missed the pleasure of your company , sir .
when she' s finished , bring her out .
hi , i' m barney .
he told you , don' t get near the glass ?
yes , he did .
clarice starling .
nice to meet you , clarice .
you can hang your coat up there if you like .
thank you .
i will .
he' s past the others , the last cell .
you keep to the right .
i put out a chair for you .
that' s very good .
thank you .
i' il be watchin ' .
you' il do fine .
hi .
i can smell your cunt !
good morning .
dr lecter , my name is clarice starling .
may i speak with you ?
you' re one of jack crawford' s , aren' t you ?
i am , yes .
may i see your credentials ?
certainly .
closer , please .
closer .
that expires in one week .
you' re not real fbl , are you ?
i' m still in training at the academy .
jack crawford sent a trainee to me ?
yes , i' m a student .
i' m here to learn from you .
maybe you can decide whether or not i' m qualified enough to do that .
that is rather slippery of you , agent starling .
sit , please .
now then , tell me .
what did miggs say to you ?
multiple miggs in the next cell .
he hissed at you .
what did he say ?
he said " i can smell your cunt .
i see .
i myself cannot .
you use evyan skin cream .
and sometimes you wear l' air du temps .
but not today .
did you do all these drawings , doctor ?
that is the duomo seen from the belvedere .
do you know florence ?
all that detail just from memory , sir ?
memory , agent starling , is what i have instead of a view .
well , perhaps you' d care to lend us your view on this questionnaire , sir .
oh , no , no , no , no .
you were doing fine .
you had been courteous and receptive to courtesy .
you had established trust , with the embarrassing truth about miggs .
and now this ham handed segue into your questionnaire .
it won' t do .
i' m only asking you to look at this .
either you will or you won' t .
yeah .
jack crawford must be very busy indeed if he' s recruiting help from the student body .
buffalo bill .
what a naughty boy he is .
do you know why he' s called buffalo bill ?
please tell me .
the newspapers won' t say .
it started as a bad joke in kansas city homicide .
they said " this one likes to skin his humps .
why do you think he removes their skins , agent starling ?
thrill me with your acumen .
it excites him .
most serial killers keep some sort of trophies from their victims .
i didn' t .
no .
no , you ate yours .
you send that through now .
oh , agent starling , you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool ?
no .
i thought that your knowledge ...
you' re so ambitious , aren' t you ?
do you know what you look like , with your good bag and your cheap shoes ?
you look like a rube .
a well scrubbed , hustling rube , with a little taste .
good nutrition' s given you length of bone , but you' re not more than one generation from poor white trash , are you ?
and that accent you' ve tried so desperately to shed : pure west virginia .
what is your father , dear ?
is he a coal miner ?
does he stink of the lamp ?
how quickly the boys found you .
all those tedious , sticky fumblings in the back seats of cars , while you could only dream of getting out , getting anywhere , getting all the way to the fbl .
you see a lot , doctor .
but are you strong enough to point that high powered perception at yourself ?
what about it ?
why don' t you look at yourself and write down what you see ?
or maybe you' re afraid to .
a census taker once tried to test me .
i ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti .
you fly back to school now , little starling .
fly , fly , fly .
i bit my wrist so i can die .
look at the blood !
got ya !
miggs , you stupid fuck !
i' m gonna kill him !
agent starling !
come back !
agent starling !
agent starling !
i would not have had that happen to you .
discourtesy is unspeakably ugly .
then do this test .
no , but i' il give you a chance for what you love most .
and what is that ?
advancement .
listen carefully .
look deep within yourself , clarice starling .
go seek out miss mofet , an old patient of mine .
m o f e t.
i don' t think miggs could manage again so soon , even though he is crazy .
go !
hey , bill .
daddy !
hey , clarice .
did you get any bad guys today , daddy ?
no , angel .
they all got away today .
fbl .
hands up .
don' t move .
turn around .
hands behind your back .
thumbs up .
you' re dead , starling .
johnson , good entry , good command .
starling , where' s your danger area ?
the corner .
did you check ?
no .
that' s why you' re dead .
3109 .
3109 .
breaking doors or windows to enter or exit .
rule 404 .
clarice , phone .
it' s the guru .
crawford ?
thanks , ardelia .
starling ?
sir ?
miggs is dead .
dead ?
how ?
they heard lecter whispering to him all afternoon and miggs crying .
they found him at bed check .
he' d swallowed his own tongue .
starling ?
yeah .
i' m still here , sir .
i just ...
i don' t know how to feel about this .
you don' t have to feel any way about it .
lecter did it to amuse himself .
mofet .
any follow up on her ?
lecter altered or destroyed most of his patients ' histories , so there' s no record of anyone named mofet , but
i thought the " yourself " reference was too hokey for lecter , so i figured he' s from baltimore and i looked in the phone book and there' s a " your self " storage facility right outside of downtown baltimore , sir .
unit 31 was leased for ten years , pre paid in full .
the contract is in the name of a miss hester mofet .
so nobody' s been in here since 1980 ?
not to my knowledge .
privacy is a great concern to my customers .
yes .
i won' t disturb anything , i promise .
i' il be outta here before you know it .
may i help you ?
yes , actually .
it' s stuck .
we could return tomorrow with my son .
what about him ?
i would ask my driver to help you , but he detests physical labour .
right .
well , you just stay here .
i' il be back in one minute .
it' s stuck .
hand me that flashlight , sir .
if this door should fall down or anything else , this is the number for our baltimore field office .
now they know that you' re with me .
call them if anything should happen .
yes , miss starling .
clarice .
they' re waiting for you .
watch your step .
hester mofet .
it' s an anagram , isn' t it , doctor ?
hester mofet .
the rest of me .
miss the rest of me .
meaning that you rented that garage ?
thank you .
your bleeding has stopped .
how did you ... ?
it' s nothing .
it was just a scratch .
dr lecter , whose head is in that bottle ?
why don' t you ask me about buffalo bill ?
do you know something about him ?
i might if i saw the case file .
you could get that for me .
why don' t we talk about miss mofet ?
you wanted me to find him .
his real name is benjamin raspail , a former patient of mine , whose romantic attachments ran to , shall we say , the exotic .
i did not kill him , merely tucked him away very much as i found him , after he' d missed three appointments .
if you didn' t kill him , then who did , sir ?
who can say ?
best thing for him , really .
his therapy was going nowhere .
his dress , make up ...
raspail was a transvestite ?
in life ?
oh , no .
garden variety manic depressive .
tedious , very tedious .
i now just think of him as a kind of experiment .
a fledgling killer' s first effort at transformation .
how did you feel when you saw him , clarice ?
scared at first , then exhilarated .
jack crawford is helping your career .
apparently he likes you and you like him .
i never thought about it .
do you think jack crawford wants you , sexually ?
true , he is much older , but do you think he visualises scenarios , exchanges , fucking you ?
that doesn' t interest me and , frankly , it' s the sort of thing that miggs would say .
not any more .
thank you , barney .
what happened to your drawings ?
punishment , you see , for miggs .
just like that gospel programme .
when you leave , they' il turn the volume way up .
dr chilton does enjoy his petty torments .
what did you mean by " transformation " , doctor ?
i' ve been in this room for eight years now , clarice .
i know they will never ever let me out while i' m alive .
what i want is a view .
i want a window where i can see a tree , or even water .
i want to be in a federal institution far away from dr chilton .
what did you mean by " fledgling killer " ?
are you saying that he' s killed again ?
i' m offering you a psychological profile of buffalo bill , based on the case evidence .
i' il help you catch him , clarice .
you know who he is , don' t you ?
tell me who decapitated your patient , doctor .
all good things to those who wait .
i' ve waited , clarice , but how long can you and old jackie boy wait ?
our little billy must already be searching for that next special lady .
memphls , tn
hey , little cheeper .
i' il be right there .
can i help you with that ?
would you ?
sure .
thank you .
you look kinda handicapped .
yeah .
i got it this far .
i just can' t get it up in the truck by myself .
here .
grab this .
ok .
just set it down .
that' s good .
get in the truck .
i wanna push it all the way up .
i really appreciate this .
thank you .
thank you .
push it all the way back .
is this good ?
yeah .
that' s great .
ok .
say , are you about a size 14 ?
sorry ?
good .
oh , good .
good .
starling !
outside .
let' s go .
cindy .
in the ring for starling .
let' s go .
fbl !
pack your field gear .
you' re going with crawford .
where ?
they found a girl' s body .
been in the water a week .
it' s a buffalo bill situation .
clay county , w va
he keeps them alive for three days .
we don' t know why .
no evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death .
all the mutilation you see there is post mortem .
ok , three days .
then he shoots them , skins them and dumps them , each body in a different river .
the water leaves us no trace evidence of any kind .
that' s fredrica bimmel , the first one .
her body was the only one he took the trouble to weight down , so actually she was the third girl found .
after her , he got lazy .
ok , let' s see .
circles where the girls were abducted .
arrows where their bodies were found .
this new one today washed up here .
elk river , west virginia .
look at him , starling .
tell me what you see .
he' s a white male .
serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic groups .
he' s not a drifter .
he' s got his own house somewhere , not an apartment .
why ?
what he does with them takes privacy .
he' s in his thirties or forties .
he' s got real physical strength , combined with an older man' s self control .
he' s cautious , precise ...
and he' s never impulsive .
he' il never stop .
why not ?
got a real taste for it now and he' s getting better at his work .
not bad , starling .
questions ?
yes , sir .
you haven' t mentioned anything about the information in my report or dr lecter' s offer , sir .
i' m considering it .
that' s why you sent me in there , isn' t it ?
to get his help on buffalo bill , sir ?
well , if that was the case , then i just wish i was in on it , that' s all .
if i' d sent you in with an actual agenda , lecter would have known it instantly .
he would have toyed with you then turned to stone .
excuse me , sheriff perkins .
these are the fbi people .
sheriff perkins jack crawford , fbl .
special agent terry .
agent starling .
we appreciate being invited into your jurisdiction .
i didn' t call you .
that was the state attorney' s office .
we' il extend you every courtesy , but ...
sheriff .
this type of sex crime has certain aspects i' d just as soon discuss in private .
know what i mean ?
oscar , fetch dr akins from the chapel .
starling , we' re back here .
tell lamar to come on when he' s finished playing his music .
yeah , we' il be sending in a minute .
i need a six way linkup .
chicago , detroit ...
what ?
excuse me .
excuse me , gentlemen .
you officers and gentlemen ,
listen here now .
there' s things we need to do for her .
i know that y' all brought her this far and her folks would thank you if they could for your kindness and your sensitivity .
but now please go on now and let us take care of her .
go on now .
thank you .
thank you .
ok , good .
yeah , that' s right .
elk river .
stand by for transmission .
ray .
doctor , lamar , let' s take a look at her .
ok , starling .
bill .
star shaped contact entrance wound over the sternum .
a muzzle stamp at the top .
wrongful death .
she' il have to go to the state pathologist at claxton .
well , i' d better get back to that service .
lamar' il help you .
lord almighty .
what else do you see , starling ?
well , she' s not local .
her ears are pierced three times and there' s glitter nail polish .
that looks like town to me .
two of her fingernails are broken off and there' s dirt or grit under them .
it looks like she' s tried to claw her way through something .
ray , get pictures of her teeth .
we' il fax ' em for missing persons .
let' s do another .
she' s got something in her throat .
when a body comes out of the water , lots of times there' s leaves in the mouth .
what is that ?
some kind of seed pod ?
no , sir .
that' s a bug cocoon .
there' s no way that could get way down in there .
not unless somebody shoved it in there .
she' il be easier to print when we turn her over .
lamar , give me a hand .
yes , sir .
i will .
oh , jack .
what do you make of these ?
different configuration than the others .
get close ups .
the victim' s skin removed , this time in two large diamond shaped sections above the buttocks .
exit wound level with the second or the third thoracic vertebrae , six inches from the right shoulder blade .
starling , when i told that sheriff we shouldn' t talk in front of a woman , that really burned you , didn' t it ?
it was just smoke , starling .
i had to get rid of him .
it matters , mr crawford .
cops look at you to see how to act .
it matters .
point taken .
ligature marks found around the wrists , not around the ankles .
this would indicate that the skinning was post mortem .
time , pilch .
my move .
you lured him with produce .
tough noogies .
it' s still my turn .
nice and slow , baby .
if the beetle moves one of your men , does that still count ?
course it counts .
how do you play ?
agent starling ?
where the heck did this come from ?
it' s practically mush .
it was found behind the soft palate of a murder victim in the elk river .
it' s buffalo bill , isn' t it ?
i can' t tell you any more .
we heard about it on the radio .
this is a clue from a real murder case ?
cool .
just ignore him .
he' s not a phd .
sphingid ceratomia , maybe .
boy , he' s a big sucker .
ok .
let' s check morphology .
what do you do when you' re not detecting , agent starling ?
i try to be a student , dr pilcher .
ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer ?
the amusing house wine ?
are you hitting on me , doctor ?
yes .
gotcha .
what have you got ?
agent starling , meet mr acherontia styx .
weird .
better known to his friends as the death' s head moth .
where does it come from ?
it' s strange .
they only live in asia .
here they' d have to be raised from imported eggs .
somebody grew this guy .
fed him honey and nightshade , kept him warm .
somebody loved him .
where are you ?
let me outta here !
help me !
please !
please help me .
please !
why won' t you answer me ?
please !
good morning .
i' m donna feruchi .
i' m gene cassel with sports .
and i' m tim langhorn .
catherine martin , the 25 year old daughter of senator ruth martin ,
listed as missing , is now believed to have been kidnapped by the serial killer known only as buffalo bill .
police indicate that the girl' s blouse has been identified , sliced up the back , in what has become a grim , all too familiar calling card .
young catherine martin is the only daughter of senator ruth martin , the republican senator from tennessee .
her kidnapping is not considered to be politically motivated , but it has stirred the government to its highest levels .
reached for comment on the ski slopes of vermont , the president is said to be , and i quote , " intensely concerned " .
just moments ago senator martin taped this dramatic personal plea .
i' m speaking now to the person who is holding my daughter .
catherine is very gentle and kind .
talk to her and you' il see .
you have the power .
you are in charge .
i know you can feel love and compassion .
you have a wonderful chance to show the whole world that you can be merciful as well as strong , that you' re big enough to treat catherine better than the world has treated you .
you have that power .
please .
my daughter is catherine .
boy , that' s smart .
jesus , that' s really smart .
she keeps repeating the name .
if he sees catherine as a person and not just an object , it' s harder to tear her up .
release my little girl .
you' re coming into my hospital to conduct an interview and refusing to share information with me for the third time .
sir , i told you , this is just a routine follow up on the raspail case .
he is my patient .
i have rights .
i understand that , sir .
look , i am not just some turnkey , miss starling .
this is the number for the us attorney' s office .
either you discuss this with him or you let me do my job , do you understand ?
if your profile helps us catch buffalo bill in time to save catherine martin , the senator promises you a transfer to the va hospital at oneida park , new york , with a view of the woods nearby .
maximum security still applies , of course .
you' d have reasonable access to books .
best of all , though , one week of the year , you get to leave the hospital and go here .
plum island .
every day of that week you may walk on the beach , you may swim in the ocean , for up to one hour , under swat team surveillance , of course .
and there you have it .
a copy of the buffalo bill case file .
a copy of the senator' s offer .
this offer is non negotiable and final .
catherine martin dies , you get nothing .
plum island animal disease research centre .
sounds charming .
that' s only a part of the island .
there' s a very nice beach .
terns nest there .
there' s beautiful ...
terns ?
if i help you , clarice , it will be " turns " with us too .
quid pro quo .
i tell you things , you tell me things .
not about this case , though .
about yourself .
quid pro quo .
yes or no ?
yes or no , clarice ?
poor little catherine is waiting .
go , doctor .
what is your worst memory of childhood ?
the death of my father .
tell me about it and don' t lie , or i' il know .
he was a town marshal .
one night he surprised two burglars coming out the back of a drugstore .
they shot him .
was he killed outright ?
no , he was very strong .
he lasted more than a month .
my mother died when i was very young .
my father had become the whole world to me , and , when he left me , i had nothing .
i was ten years old .
you' re very frank , clarice .
i think it would be quite something to know you in private life .
quid pro quo , doctor .
so tell me about miss west virginia .
was she a large girl ?
yes .
big through the hips ?
roomy ?
they all were .
what else ?
she had an object deliberately inserted into her throat .
now , that hasn' t been made public yet .
we don' t know what it means .
was it a butterfly ?
yes .
a moth .
just like the one we found in benjamin raspail' s head an hour ago .
why does he place them there , doctor ?
the significance of the moth is change .
caterpillar into chrysalis , or pupa , and from thence into beauty .
our billy wants to change , too .
there' s no correlation between transsexualism and violence .
transsexuals are very passive .
clever girl .
you' re so close to the way you' re gonna catch him , do you realise that ?
no .
tell me why .
after your father' s murder you were orphaned .
what happened next ?
i don' t imagine the answer is on those second rate shoes , clarice .
i lived with my mother' s cousin and her husband in montana .
they had a ranch .
was it a cattle ranch ?
sheep and horses .
how long did you live there ?
two months .
why so briefly ?
i ran away .
why , clarice ?
did the rancher make you perform fellatio ?
did he sodomise you ?
no .
he was a very decent man .
quid pro quo , doctor .
billy is not a real transsexual .
but he thinks he is .
he tries to be .
he' s tried to be a lot of things , i expect .
you said that i was very close to the way we would catch him .
what did you mean ?
johns hopkins , the university of minnesota and columbus medical centre .
i wouldn' t be surprised if billy had applied for sex reassignment at all of them and been rejected .
on what basis would they reject him ?
look for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence .
our billy wasn' t born a criminal , clarice .
he was made one through years of systematic abuse .
billy hates his own identity , you see , and he thinks that makes him a transsexual .
but his pathology is a thousand times more savage and more terrifying .
it rubs the lotion on its skin .
it does this whenever it' s told .
mister , my family' il pay cash .
whatever ransom you' re asking for , they' il pay it .
it rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again .
yes , it will , precious .
it will get the hose .
ok , ok .
mister , if you let me go , i won' t press charges , i promise .
see , my mom is a real important woman .
i guess you already know that .
now it places the lotion in the basket .
please !
please !
i wanna go home , please !
it places the lotion in the basket .
i wanna see my mommy !
please !
i wanna see my ...
i wanna see my mommy .
put the fucking lotion in the basket !
you still think you' re gonna walk on some beach and see the birdies ?
i don' t think so .
i called senator ruth martin .
she never heard of any deal with you .
they scammed you , hannibal .
stand outside .
and shut the door .
there never was a deal with senator martin , but there is now .
i designed it .
of course , i worked in a few conditions for my own benefit as well .
identify buffalo bill by name and , if the girl is found in time ,
senator martin will have you transferred to the state prison in tennessee .
answer me , hannibal .
you answer me now or , by god , you' il never leave this cell .
who is buffalo bill ?
his first name is louis .
i' il tell the rest to the senator herself , but only in tennessee .
and i have a few conditions of my own .
clean him up and get him ready to go .
jack , hannibal lecter' s being transferred to memphis .
transferred ?
did you have a trainee make a phoney offer to lecter in the senator' s name ?
yeah , i rolled the dice .
i had to .
well , she' s mad as hell , jack .
paul krendler' s over here from justice .
she' s asking him to take over in memphis .
memphls internatlonal alrport
welcome to memphis .
i' m lieutenant boyle .
this is sergeant patrick .
we' il treat you as good as you treat us .
you be a gentleman , you' re gonna get three hots and a cot .
sir .
you sign right here , we' il have us a legal transfer .
where' s ... ?
here , sir .
use mine .
senator martin , dr hannibal lecter .
dr lecter , i brought an affidavit guaranteeing your new rights .
you' il wanna read it before i sign .
i won' t waste your time or catherine' s time , bargaining for petty privileges .
clarice starling and that awful jack crawford have wasted far too much time .
i only pray they haven' t doomed the poor girl .
let me help you now and i will trust you when it is all over .
you have my word .
paul ?
buffalo bill' s real name is louis friend .
i met him just once .
he was referred to me in april or may 1980 by my patient , benjamin raspail .
they were lovers , you see .
but raspail had become very frightened .
apparently , louis had murdered a transient and done things with the skin .
we need his address and a physical description .
tell me , senator .
did you nurse catherine yourself ?
what ?
did you breast feed her ?
now , wait a minute .
yes , i did .
toughened your nipples , didn' t it ?
you son of a bitch !
amputate a man' s leg and he can still feel it tickling .
tell me , mom , when your little girl is on the slab , where will it tickle you ?
take this thing back to baltimore .
five foot ten , strongly built , about 180 pounds .
hair blond , eyes pale blue .
he' d be about 35 now .
he said he lived in philadelphia but may have lied .
that' s all i can remember , mom , but if i think of any more , i will let you know .
and , senator , just one more thing .
love your suit .
in a meeting this evening with senator ruth martin ,
dr lecter agreed to assist in the investigation of trying to find the abductor , buffalo bill .
how do you fit in ?
my insight into lecter' s mind
made this breakthrough possible .
buffalo bill' s real name ?
that is now a matter of record with the proper authorities .
my name is dr frederick chilton .
how do you spell that ?
are you with dr chilton' s group ?
well , i just saw him outside , sir .
access to lecter is limited .
we' ve been getting death threats .
i understand , sir .
log in and check your weapon .
i can' t take all the credit .
senator martin , the justice department , people at the fbl , folks at the baltimore state hospital .
and now for the hard part : apprehending the suspect .
excuse me , folks .
i' m gonna have to catch a flight .
is it true what they' re sayin ' ?
he' s some kind of vampire ?
they don' t have a name for what he is .
you do know the rules , ma' am ?
yes , lieutenant boyle .
i' ve questioned him before .
go ahead .
good evening , clarice .
i thought you might like your drawings back , doctor .
just until you get your view .
how very thoughtful .
or did jack crawford send you for one last wheedle before you' re both booted off the case ?
no , i came because i wanted to .
people will say we' re in love .
anthrax island .
that was an especially nice touch , clarice .
yours ?
yes .
yeah .
that was good .
pity about poor catherine , though .
ticktock , ticktock , ticktock .
your anagrams are showing , doctor .
louis friend ?
iron sulfide , also known as fool' s gold .
oh , clarice , your problem is you need to get more fun out of life .
you were telling me the truth back in baltimore , sir .
please continue now .
i' ve read the case files .
have you ?
everything you need to find him is there in those pages .
then tell me how .
first principles , clarice .
simplicity .
read marcus aurelius .
of each particular thing , ask what is it in itself ?
what is its nature ?
what does he do , this man you seek ?
he kills women .
no .
that is incidental .
what is the first thing he does ?
what needs does he serve by killing ?
anger .
social acceptance .
sexual frustrations .
no .
he covets .
that is his nature .
and how do we begin to covet , clarice ?
do we seek out things to covet ?
make an effort to answer now .
no .
we just ...
no , we begin by coveting what we see every day .
don' t you feel eyes moving over your body , clarice ?
and don' t your eyes seek out the things you want ?
all right , yes .
now please tell me how ...
no .
it is your turn to tell me , clarice .
you don' t have any more vacations to sell .
why did you leave that ranch ?
doctor , we don' t have any more time for any of this now .
but we don' t reckon time the same way , do we ?
this is all the time you' il ever have .
later .
listen to me .
we' ve only got five ...
no .
i will listen now .
after your father' s murder , you were orphaned .
you went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in montana .
and ?
and one morning i just ran away .
not " just " , clarice .
what set you off ?
you started at what time ?
early .
still dark .
then something woke you , didn' t it ?
was it a dream ?
what was it ?
i heard a strange noise .
what was it ?
it was screaming .
some kind of screaming .
like a child' s voice .
what did you do ?
i went downstairs .
outside .
i crept up into the barn .
i was so scared to look inside , but i had to .
what did you see , clarice ?
what did you see ?
lambs .
they were screaming .
they were slaughtering the spring lambs ?
and they were screaming .
and you ran away ?
no .
first i tried to free them .
i opened the gate to their pen , but they wouldn' t run .
they just stood there , confused .
they wouldn' t run .
but you could and you did , didn' t you ?
yes .
i took one lamb and i ran away as fast as i could .
where were you going , clarice ?
i don' t know .
i didn' t have any food , any water and it was very cold , very cold .
i thought ...
i thought if i could save just one , but ...
he was so heavy .
so heavy .
i didn' t get more than a few miles when the sheriff' s car picked me up .
the rancher was so angry , he sent me to live at the orphanage in bozeman .
i never saw the ranch again .
what became of your lamb , clarice ?
he killed him .
you still wake up sometimes , don' t you ?
wake up in the dark and hear the screaming of the lambs ?
yes .
and you think , if you save poor catherine , you could make them stop , don' t you ?
you think if catherine lives , you won' t wake up in the dark ever again to that awful screaming of the lambs .
i don' t know .
