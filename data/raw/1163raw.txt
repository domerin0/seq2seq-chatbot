ditka is a great coach , we understand that , but he' s a football coach .

right .
and we are still losing , phil .
okay , i understand your concern about our record , but with me it' s not about win lose .
we are going to win one game eventually , right ?
well , we' ve had a rocky start , but with a strong team effort , we will win some
i think .
remember , there' s no " l " in team .
but there is an " l " in win .
there is an " l " in win .
hey , wait .
uh , parents , honey .
i didn' t see you step up when the team was in need .
okay .
okay .
phil is not the greatest coach in the world ,
i' il give you that , but at least he' s trying .
i can defend myself , please .
you think he enjoys losing week after week , in front of his own son ?
you' re making it worse .
you' re making it worse .

i' ve got my hands full with hunter .
i don' t need a bird .
okay , you know what ?

the finches were a bad idea .
and i wasn' t going to say this , but i think some of them have salmonella .

you go to my mortal enemy for help ?
that' s no way to talk about your neighbor .
oh , yeah ?
he' s right .
i hated him from the first time i laid eyes on him .
maybe even before that , because i know you' re the guy that wrote
ditka sucks " on my driveway .

i' m glad you figured it out .
and i' m getting under your skin .

it' s mike ditka .
he' s big .
stay out of this .
i' il tell you for the last time .
hit the road !
who' s gonna make me ?
i am .
you' re acting like oh !
i took a punch from hall of famer , mike ditka , and i did not go down .

that ditka has fists like a small truck .
come here .
okay .
yeah , you need to relax .
yeah .
you should' ve seen the look on my dad' s face .
priceless .
' cause that punch was meant for him , that' s what makes me feel so good .

okay .
i quit .
i give up .
i give up .
you go talk to ditka .
what for ?
he scares me .
have you ever looked into his eyes ?
or at his hair ?
well , he' s been coaching for a long time .
share your feelings with him .
you want me to share my feelings of inadequacy with mike ditka ?
uh .
what else can you do ?
okay .
you' re right .
you' re right .
you' re always right .
i' m sorry .
i' il go talk to him .

hey , hey , get a grip on yourself , okay ?
man up .
i can' t .

i don' t like coffee .
it' s a vasoconstrictor .
hey , coffee is the number one drink in the world .
everybody drinks it .
even little kids in mexico drink coffee .
well , i' m not a little kid in mexico .
okay ? ln fact , i don' t know who i am .
i took a long hard look at myself in the mirror , and you know what i saw ?
what ?
nothing .
my dad , he' s something .
i mean , i' ve never lived up to my dad' s expectations .
and to top it all off , i' m letting sam down .
my own son !
ah .
hey !
ow !
knock it off .
i don' t care about that .

l i can' t do it .
i can' t coach .
i can' t beat my old man .
you can beat your dad !
he' s just a man .
this coaching business , paul , is tough stuff .
phil .
whatever .
it' s tough stuff .
and when you lose , it all comes down on you .
but listen , when you put it all together , and you win , it' s the greatest feeling in the world .
it' s like winning the super bowl .
really ?
yeah , really .
except , you saddled me with a bunch of stiffs .
take me 3 years to get these guys shaped up .
i' m sorry .
but i got a good idea .
maybe we take a shortcut , stick it to your old man real good .
but in order to do that , we gotta get some fresh meat .

i don' t want to get thrown out .
can' t a guy just be enthusiastic about the game ?
you can be enthusiastic ...

yes !
gladiators take the lead .
was anyone listening ?
the italians have effectively been shut down .
great .
that' s my boy !
that' s the half .
honey , wh where have you been ?
i called you twice .
what ?
why isn' t sam in his uniform ?
so , how' s it going ?
it took me all morning to convince him to come .
and the only reason he is here is to support his team .
what , he doesn' t want to play for me ?
he would love to play for you but you' ve turned him into a benchwarmer .
sound familiar ?
look , i just wanted to get to the championship game , that ...
well , you' re here , phil .
i' m not crying .
it' s frustration .
don' t worry .
you' il be all right .

i promise you , i' il play you next season , okay ?
you want to be gladiators ?

you doing okay ?
i know this is tough .
hey , guys .
sam , you think i could talk to you ?
i guess .
honey , do you mind ?
sure .
so , i just was thinking , uh ...
you know , grown ups are always telling kids how they mess up , right ?
but the truth is sometimes grown ups screw up but we don' t have anyone to tell us when we do it .
i screwed up , sam .
you think ?
i just got caught up in everything .
i really lost my way , i mean ,
i apologize .
i just wanna ask you if you if you can find it in your heart to forgive me and you give me a second chance ,
i' d like to make it up to you .
okay .
you accept my apology then ?
yeah .
thanks , buddy .
all right .
you' re starting the second half .
