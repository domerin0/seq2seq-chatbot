you made a mistake back on that island , bond .
you took something that didn' t belong to you , from a friend of mr big' s .
that type of mistake is tough to bounce back from .
but i' ve only just arrived .
today is your lucky day , jim !
you' re going skydiving !
there' s a helluva view of the lake from 10, 000 feet .
my only regret is i won' t be there to see it .
let' s go !
good morning .
you' re ...
mrs bell .
you' re not my instructor .
where' s mr bleeker ?
indisposed .
i' il be giving the lesson .
what' s on for today ?
let' s just wing it , shall we , mrs bell ?
you' re over revving .
leroy , slow down , for pete' s sake !
do what the man say !
i can' t ...
i can' t find the brake !
close those doors !
holy shit !
ok , don .
don' t worry , i' il take care of it .
right .
talk to you later .
i' ve got to go and give a lesson .
same time tomorrow , mrs bell ?
yes , mr bleeker .
yes , sir .
i know you just can' t glue the wings back on .
now , mr bleeker , i' m sure there' s no reason for name calling .
that' s fine .
don' t forget the double vents .
i appreciate she' s one of your best pupils .
that' s a little frantic .
i' il keep the other three .
any such suggestion should be put in writing to washington .
how is mrs bell ?
intensive care , but she' il pull through .
yes , sir .
no one' s questioning your patriotism .
i' m sure you' re a veteran , sir .
felix , find out if there' s a fillet of soul restaurant in town .
we' re way ahead of you .
it' s on docker street .
strutter' s watching it now .
hell of a send off .
this way .
where' s strutter ?
he' s gotta be inside somewhere .
two , gentlemen ?
i got a nice booth over here , just against the wall .
do you think you could find something a little closer to the stage ?
what' s wrong with a booth ?
i once had a nasty turn in a booth .
bourbon .
no ice , please .
two sazeracs .
where' s your sense of adventure ?
this is new orleans .
relax !
one of you felix leiter ?
yeah , right here .
call for you .
a guy called strutter .
thanks .
for a minute , i thought harry was laying down on a job .
what happened to my ...
what happened to my friend ?
what happened ?
listen .
thanks for droppin ' in , baby .
yeah , you' re one tough pig to nail down .
you' ve been picking at me like some kind of maggot .
first , you go up to harlem and kill one of the brothers .
and that disturbed me .
and then you go and steal this valuable young lady from my good friend , dr kananga .
now , old kananga , he believes in all that card crap .
i mean , he' s mad .
well , possession being nine points of the law ,
i would say kananga is your problem now .
thank you .
in fact , if i were you , i' d ... watch my step from now on .
yeah , well , you just let me handle our business with the man .
i got my own plans for you , baby .
but first there' s one little question that he wants answers for .
then you' d better ship me back to the island and let him ask in person .
i' m not in the habit of giving answers to lackeys .
you damn lucky you got an ear left to hear the question with .
which is ... did you mess with that ?
that' s between solitaire and myself ... and kananga .
i' il tell him when i see him .
you won' t see sunlight unless you answer !
i' d no idea you were so frightened of him .
did you touch her ? !
when i see kananga .
right .
quite revealing .
kananga : poppy grower in thousands of acres of well camouflaged fields , protected by the voodoo threat of baron samedi .
then there' s mr big , distributor and wholesaler through a chain of fillet of soul restaurants .
wholesale ?
sell heroin , for money ? !
my apologies .
i' m sure you simply give it away .
excellent , mr bond .
that' s precisely what i intend to do .
two tons of it , to be exact .
when entering into a fiercely competitive field , one finds it advisable to give away free samples .
man or woman , black or white .
i don' t discriminate .
two tons of heroin with a street value well over a billion dollars nationally distributed free ?
that should make a certain group of families rather angry , wouldn' t you say ?
angry ?
why , my dear mr bond , it' il positively drive them out of their minds .
and subsequently out of the business .
quite ingenious .
a sort of junkies ' welfare system .
merely until the number of addicts in the country has doubled , shall we say ?
then i will market that acreage you blundered into the other day .
that heroin will be very expensive indeed , leaving myself and the phone company the only two going monopolies in this nation for years to come .
and here i thought it was solitaire who did the fortune telling .
let' s hope for both your sakes she still can .
the question still stands , mr bond .
asked by the gentleman concerned .
did you touch her ?
well , it' s not the sort of question ... a gentleman answers .
well , having set the example , i don' t expect miss solitaire to be any less the lady .
by the way , that' s a particularly handsome watch you' re wearing , mr bond .
may i see it , please ?
you' il forgive me if i don' t get up .
butterhook !
tee hee .
on the first wrong answer from miss solitaire , you will snip the little finger of mr bond' s right hand .
starting with the second wrong answer , you will proceed to the more ... vital areas .
solitaire , my dear ,
i want you to listen to me very carefully .
3 2 6
6 .
do i speak the truth ?
you speak the truth .
well , ... if nothing else , at least i' ve laid your fears to rest .
my compliments on a splendid operation .
there is one thing , however , the ...
whisper .
take him to the farm .
when do we start back ?
soon , solitaire .
soon .
solitaire , why ?
i treated you well .
you lacked for nothing .
i don' t understand what you ...
mr bond' s watch , my dear .
i gave you every break possible .
you had a 50 50 chance .
you weren' t even close .
i had no choice .
please believe me ...
the cards !
when the time came , i myself would have given you love .
you knew that .
you knew that !
there' s only one proper way to deal with this .
and one proper time .
the tonnage order is nearly complete .
we move it out tonight .
and i mean tonight !
mr bond .
how much do you know about crocodiles , bond ?
i' ve ... always tried to keep them at arm' s length myself .
cute little nippers , ain' t they ?
i don' t suppose those potential overnight bags are orphans .
oh , no !
we have some moms and dads as well .
in fact , quite a few thousand .
this is the part i like best : feeding time .
i suspect , the highlight of the tour .
some of these babies live to be 200 years old .
look over there .
that' s an alligator .
you can always tell by its round nose .
there' s old albert .
he' s a croc .
got careless with him some time back , and he took my whole arm off .
well done , albert !
they' il eat anything .
even each other .
then again , sometime they can go a whole year without eating .
i was rather counting on that .
there are two ways to disable a crocodile , you know .
i ... don' t suppose you' d care to share that information with me ?
one way is to jam a pencil into the depression hole behind his eyes .
and the other ?
the other' s twice as simple .
you just put your hand in his mouth and pull his teeth out .
fire !
evans , get him !
adam , in the car !
head him off !
hector , move , damn it !
bond ripped off one of our boats .
he' s headed for the lrish bayou .
the man that gets him , stays alive !
now move , you mothers !
toby .
i got me a regular ben hur down here .
doin ' 95 , minimum .
need any help , jw ?
hell , no !
you got a set of wheels that just won' t quit , boy !
if they' s yours , that is .
you spin around , boy .
ten fingers on the fender .
legs apart .
i' m sure this ain' t exactly your debut at this sort of thing .
you picked the wrong parish to haul ass through , boy .
nobody cuts and runs on sheriff jw pepper .
and that' s him speakin ' that , by the bye !
what the ...
jw ?
soon as you nail that offendin ' vehicle , miss pearsonjust called .
seems her dog' s foamin ' all at the mouth .
she' s got him locked up in the shed and wondered ifyou' d like to come over and shoot it for her .
you tell miss pearson to take a flyin ' ...
that look like a boat stuck in the sheriff' s car there , eddie ?
boy , where you been all your life ?
that there' s one of them new car boats .
by the powers invested in me by this parish ,
i hereby do commandeer this vehicle and all those persons within .
and that means you , smartass !
unit 23 in position .
ten four , 23 .
come in , 28 .
hey , jw .
seems like deke rogers done got his boat stole offthe river but got a new one in his swimming pool .
sheriff , get your boys offmy frequency !
give me that !
now you listen to me , trooper boy !
we got a swamp full of black russians drivin ' boats to beat the band down here !
relax , sheriff .
we' ve got a roadblock waiting for them at miller' s bridge .
unit 26 at miller' s bridge .
we' re just about all set here .
make that secure there !
d' you hear ?
ok , fellas .
here they come !
all right , out of my way !
i' m in charge here !
you two boys , come on !
i want those two men and their boats apprehended immediately !
yes , sir , captain .
i understand .
but , i don' t know where we' re gonna find a boat fast enough to catch ' em .
call my brother in law , billy bob .
he' s got the fastest boat on the whole damn river .
billy bob' il sure enough fix their ass !
yeah , call billy bob .
there' s two boats , billy bob .
they' re movin ' like buttered pigs !
now , i promised these boys here you' d get ' em .
don' t let me down .
cool down , jw .
i' m on my way .
want something , boy ?
yes .
i' d like to borrow this boat , if i may .
everybody on the river would like to borrow this boat .
billy bob , we' ve got ' em spotted .
they' re headed for hayley' s landing .
that' s my brother in law !
that' s billy bob !
he' il get ' em !
billy bob' il get ' em !
hot damn !
if one side of the pepper family don' t get ' em , the other side will !
let' s go !
if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together ,
iet him now speak , or else hereafter ...
headquarters to all units .
suspects seen proceeding down by liberty towards highway 11 .
proceed with caution .
would you get that chicken coop off the road ? !
did you ever think of gettin ' a driver' s licence , boy ? !
are you sure that was your brother in law , sheriff ?
felix , what are you doing here ?
we' il get to that later .
kananga' s in town .
he' s got your girl .
they just took off .
there' s the son of a bitch !
i got him !
what are you ?
some kind of doomsday machine , boy ?
well , we' ve got a cage strong enough to hold an animal like you here !
captain , enlighten the sheriff , please .
yes , sir .
jw , let me have a word with you .
jw , now this fella' s from london , england .
he' s an englishman workin ' in cooperation with our boys .
a sort of secret agent .
secret agent ? !
on whose side ? !
we busted the fillet of soul an hour ago .
we came up with nothing but these .
kananga' s clear .
you should have seen the size of the guy on the boat with him .
nine feet tall , i swear .
big top hat , a cockamamie flute in one hand and solitaire in the other .
the incendiary bombs are set for midnight .
now , that gives you exactly ... 30 minutes .
watch out for sharks on the way back .
we' il see you for breakfast , felix .
good hunting !
you' re going to need these and the shark gun on the way back .
seems like the party' s started .
my regards to baron samedi , man right between the eyes .
trouble !
mr bond !
there you are !
and miss solitaire as well .
hardly unexpected , but most welcome .
whisper !
two more glasses for our guests !
what shall we drink to , mr bond ?
how about an earthquake ?
welcome home .
where' s our boy ?
he' il be along any time now .
i checked behind a rock and his wet suit is gone .
keep the change .
it is unfortunate your wet suit was found only minutes before the field was destroyed .
don' t tell me you' re not insured ?
the poppy is a very sturdy flower .
you have been a relatively minor nuisance , in fact .
but this gun ...
i find it particularly fascinating .
what is it ?
a shark gun , naturally .
with compressed gas pellets .
ingenious !
don' t pull the pin out .
the air in here is foul enough already .
somehow i never thought of you as a poor loser .
i was hoping you would join me to drink to the future .
miss solitaire used to know all about the future .
especially predicting death .
an underground monorail .
connected to the last refuge of a scoundrel , no doubt .
the heroin leaves here , i take it , carried somewhere by that winch .
correct again , mr bond .
what a quick study you are .
let me show you exactly how it works .
where in hell can the man be ?
relax !
he must have got tied up somewhere .
these cans hold 25 pounds each .
there are 20 cans to a shipment , packed in watertight metal containers .
it' s your show , but isn' t there a simpler way of drowning someone ?
drown , mr bond ?
i doubt you' d get the chance to drown .
perhaps we could try something on an even simpler vein .
on the contrary , mr bond ,
i think you' il find those wounds quite fatal .
whisper ...
the gate .
slowly , whisper , slowly , slowly .
let our diners assemble .
look out !
where' s kananga ?
he always did have an inflated opinion of himself .
oh , james !
how do we get out of here ?
we take the train , of course .
thanks for everything , felix .
see you tomorrow night at the 21 club .
why do you want to travel this way ?
what the hell can the two of you do on the train for 16 hours ?
say goodbye to felix , darling .
now , the first thing to learn in playing gin rummy is never take a card from the exposed pile unless you really need it .
gin .
james !
what are you doing ?
just testing an old adage .
unlucky at cards ...
do hurry up , james .
won' t be a moment , darling .
lock the door as well on your way up , would you , james ?
after all , we wouldn' t want anyone to just walk in on us , would we ?
for the first time in my life , i feel like a complete woman .
the slightest touch of your hand ...
i was always so afraid that a part of me would stay with the past .
but now i know there' s no chance of that any longer .
to be able to reach out and touch you ...
mr bond .
it' s good to see you again .
well , that wasn' t very funny !
now what are you doing ?
just being disarming , darling .
