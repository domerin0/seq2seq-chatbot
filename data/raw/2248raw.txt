are you fucking serious ?
that isn' t what you picked ?
no , no , that' s what i picked .
ok .
this song is for someone who' s here tonight .
if you search for tenderness
it isn' t hard to find
you can have the love you need to live ...
little low .
if you look for truthfulness
you might just as well be blind
it always seems to be so hard to give
honesty
it' s such a lonely word
everyone is so untrue
honesty
is hardly ever heard
it' s mostly what i need from you
i can find a lover
i can find a friend
i can have security until the bitter end
anyone can comfort me with promises again
i know
i know
hey , jude ?
oh , fuck off .
what ?
oh , it' s not that .
i' ve got this band .
serpentine ?
oh , have you ever heard of us ?
no .
anyway , rain , our singer ... she got sent to rehab .
so i was thinking ...
hey , otis !
what' s up ?
oh , can i borrow this ?
we watched it last week , right ?
yeah , but i want to listen to the commentary .
you want to ?
uh , i gotta get home .
yeah , i saw your ... gil .
hey , the baby' s cute .
yeah .
who would you say he looked like ?
shit , i don' t know .
what' s the name of the pretty one ?
diane .
no , no , no .
a guy , you know ?
you know , if you had to say a guy he looked like .
i didn' t really see him .
he' s a baby , you know , cute , you know .
that' s all i meant .
like , puppies and shit .
i' il see you thursday .
yeah , sure .
serpentine' s playing ?
ok .
see ya .
otis ?
is that you ?
did you leave this at my house ?
does 5/ 13/ 85 mean anything to you ?
if so , meet me at cahuenga grounds at 11 : 00 .
it' s a little dramatic .
i' m sorry .
i' m nicky .
what is this about ?
i don' t want you to get the wrong impression .
i' m not a bad guy .
i' m a documentary filmmaker .
and i have a proposal for you .
strictly legitimate .
what do you know about this date ?
you had a kid on that day .
somewhere in phoenix .
tell me i have that wrong .
do you want a coffee or anything ?
a scone or ...
i don' t i don' t have any children .
well , not legally , yeah .
but , i mean , you know , he' s still yours .
see hey , see ?
i know it' s a boy .
i know everything about him .
i know his name , i know where he lives .
he wrote , when he turned 18 , about a year ago ... for all that information that they have to give you .
that' s how i got your name .
he wants to contact me ?
well ... no .
but they sent him back this file , which he showed me ... and i have in a very safe place .
but he didn' t want to go through with it ...
' cause he' s such a suck up to his fake parents .
i hate to tell you , he' s really kind of a pussy .
who are you ?
i' m a friend .
i' m like a mentor ... guy .
he went to my high school six years after me .
do you want to find him ?
because i can tell you how ... on one condition ... which is ... you let me film the whole thing you finding your kid .
see , i need to get into afl .
do you know afl ?
afi is american film institute .
so , they have scholarships .
well , they have , like , one scholarship a year ... so i need a killer film .
a documentary , like you finding your kid .
i don' t believe this .
ok , yeah .
we' d have to fake parts of it .
sure , we would .
but the emotion would be true .
your guilt and stuff ... that would be our selling point .
i am so glad that you' re not a dog .
i mean , you know , even if the story is great ... people want to look at good looking people .
you know , all things being equal .
so , huge relief when i saw you , you know ?
and i can make you look better .
that' s lighting .
i don' t need to see my son .
i was going to have an abortion , in fact ... until someone talked me out it .
if you don' t care , then why' d you keep updating the adoption agency ... with your addresses ?
there' s four of them in the file .
he has the information .
he can contact me if he wants to .
he won' t .
he threw it away .
the whole file .
that' s how i got it .
if it wasn' t for me , you' d go to your grave without ever seeing him .
you can keep that .
i have the original .
i needed to reshoot finding it for the movie .
there' s other stuff , too .
there' s other stuff like this that i can
anyway , just ... say yes .
i mean , it' s win win here .
this is a human being you' re talking about .
yeah !
who you gave away , ok ?
i mean , come on , don' t don' t be like that .
look , i know that this is one of those big ideas ... but it' s really just better if you just say yes to the movie ... because otherwise , i have to charge you 25k just for the info .
that' s what they want at afi for a year .
ok , you tell me where my son is or i' m going to the police .
in fact , no , i' m going to go to the police anyway ... you miserable jackass !
and i' m gonna press every charge they come up with .
how' s that for a big idea ?
fuck .
fuck !
god damn it !
you know ... what i didn' t figure is that you wouldn' t care .
which you don' t .
you haven' t even asked me his first name .
i was gonna throw you that bone .
but you know what ?
fuck you !
no , no , no , you can tell me his first name .
no , you blew it .
wow , you look ... different .
well , yeah , it was a long time ago , ok ?
what' d you look like back then ?
i don' t forget it .
listen , do you know who the father is ?
because if you say no , maybe this guy will go to him .
no .
father unknown .
i mean , of course , i know who the father was ... but that' s what i put down on the forms .
and the father' s dead .
plane crash .
and you don' t have 25, 000 ?
no , i can barely pay the first and second on the house !
how can i
what about your family ?
no , none of them know about the baby .
except my dad .
he' s dead , too .
you know a lot of dead people .
well , it happens .
it' s creepy .
i' m young , and i don' t even care
how lucky am i ?
i' m young , with a few bucks to spare
and i don' t even try
i know it' s all in my mind
how lucky am i ?
how lucky am i ?
ok , that was awesome !
you sounded just like rain , and she was good .
really ?
' cause her tape sucks .
can you slur and then have your forehead hit the mike ?
that was , like , her signature .
hey , miles , let' s get this in the van for tomorrow .
god , i don' t know what to do with this song !
we could slow it down maybe .
go slow ?
hey , do you guys mind if i ask you something ?
she' s not in rehab for drugs .
it' s just booze .
plus , she' s a vomiter .
a fat vomiter , which is fucking useless .
no ... just , why is otis the leader ?
i could drum better than him and his backup vocals suck .
look around .
yeah , he' s an untalented little faggot ... but he' s a rich , untalented little faggot .
his dad owns linux hills mall .
or , like , most of it .
and he knows every club owner in town .
you think we could buy this stuff on our own ?
he' s like bill gates .
that makes sense .
for now .
until pappy finds out ... his kid' s a pickle smoker , then we' re history .
he' s already got his suspicions .
he' s gay ?
total cocksmooch .
he' il deny it , but ...
he' s not gay .
he just he looks gay .
dude , you won' t even take a piss with him .
hey , there' s beer , too , guys .
why do you think he' s a drummer ?
so he can stare at our asses all night .
that' s him .
sure ?
ok , yeah .
hurry .
hurry .
here .
oh , god .
ok .
not a good wiper .
what kind of movies does this guy make ?
i don' t know .
he' s an idiot .
the kind idiots make , i guess .
all right , we' re looking for a file , ok ?
don' t mess anything up , if you can .
not that he' d notice .
yeah , check the duffel bag .
what if it' s in his car ?
javi .
ok .
this is
this is the form i signed .
i left this with them , to go with the baby .
who' s miriam ?
me .
is there anything else , anywhere ?
did you see a file ?
there' s no name .
mamie , we' d better go .
hey , wait , wait , wait .

he' il never know the difference .
thank you .
whoa !

no , no !
what are you doing here ?
it' s ok .
i followed you today .

i can' t believe you !
my god , nicky , no .
it' s nothing like that , no .
what' s he doing here , then ?
he' s your new documentary .
ok ?
javier , this is nicky ... the director i was telling you about .
he' s an immigrant , ok ?
from mexico .
and ... he was in gangs .
they had gangs there , all right ?
and he crossed the border ... so that he could put his life back together in the states .
it' s the american dream .
ok ?
it' s good .
is that it ?
that sucks !
you think that' s as good ... as a mother finding the kid she ditched ?
all right , well , if you' re not interested in that
no , i' m not interested , ok ?
we' re done .
i can get into afi some other way .
i can shoot ... me getting into afl .
that' d be a good
just get the fuck out of here .
all right , all right , we' il go .
so but we' il work out another deal .
no , you' ve got nothing to offer .
i got nothing to sell .
it' s cool , man , ok ?
we get it .
ok ?
we couldn' t think of anything better , but you' re right .
who wants to see a movie about a sex worker ?
what ?
a sex worker .
that' s what i do .
massage , the works , you know ?
for these rich beverly hills ladies ?
but you know what ?
sex
no , sex shouldn' t be in a serious movie .
come on , mamie .
no , whoa , whoa .
if it' s ... necessary to the story , then ...
what are we doing ?
now we' re helping him ?
you want to know where your son is , right ?
how hard could it be ?
we do a couple interviews ... we put it all on the computer .
right ?
the tapes , everything ?
he gives us the name , and we give him the movie .
yeah .
well , you heard him , though .
he wants to shoot you doing the sex stuff .
so we fake it .
it' il be pretend .
you can be there to see .
look , you' re the boss .
i' m just the star .
have you done that ?
that kind of massage ?
happy ending ?
the full release ?
yeah .
one time .
with you last week .
nah .
that was just a goof .
so is this .
but at the end of it , you' re going to know who your son is .
happy endings .
you know , that' d be a good title for his movie .
you should tell him that .
it could be your idea .
oh , well .
it' s late .
the lady from mexico said i could take some of this home .
she went to bed .
guatemala .
really ?
she didn' t tell me her name .
my cousin is charging me rent , and she' s got all her food labeled .
she said it' s so that her boyfriend has what he wants when he comes home .
oh , shit !
there were subs left ?
do you mind ?
aw , yes !
yeah , the thing is , you need a day job .
we just get meals sometimes .
couple bucks .
i told you that .

i really want to spend the night .
i figure you should get something out of it , too .
but i' ve got a girlfriend .
otis , come on .
you should try it .
you might not be who you think you are .
you can leave your watch on .
oh , i don' t have a condom .

i' m frank .
i' m jude .
i' m with otis .

yeah .
your dad' s home .
oh , shit !
he' s early .
you totally owe me , dude .
he does not think you' re a ' mo anymore .
hey , i am not gay .
hello ?
you hello .
hey , otis .
hey .
nice girl .
yeah , she' s in the band now .
ok .
listen ... don' t make dignora wash the sheets , ok ?
she' s like your mother .
ok , gil .
i have something to tell you .
but before i do , you have to promise me ... that i' m the boss of this , ok ?
what ?
ok , i' ve discovered something , which i don' t have to tell you ... so the fact that i' m doing that ... means you have to hand it over to me ... which means that what i say goes , ok ?
no .
fine .
up to you .
absolutely fine .
it' s cool .
come on , please ?
it' s really good .
this is really great .
you' il thank me .
if you want to tell me , tell me .
ok .
you promise i' m the boss ?
how old are you ?
look , only i cared to put this thing together .
i think that gives me a little ownership .
i' m not crazy here .
i mean , this is really , really good .
ok , you' re the boss , i agree .
in all things pertaining to this extraordinary development ...
i will be guided by you , is that ok ?
" guided " meaning ?
charley !
ok .
max is your kid .
your biological descendant .
your spawn .
what' re you talking about ?
ok , this has been bugging me for months ... but now i' m so sure .
3 1/ 2 years ago , you donated sperm to their gyno .
yes .
after three months of trying , pam said it wasn' t working ... and they were gonna get a donor from a sperm bank .
yes .
they were upset about it , remember ?
pam was a wreck .
fact : six months later , they' re pregnant .
sperm can be kept viable for up to twelve years ... if frozen correctly , according to this website i found .
when your parents came to visit a year ago ...
pam , max , and diane all got sick ... and couldn' t come over to visit because your mother ... would recognize max as her grandchild .
and , finally ...
you ... max .
all kids look alike !
no , no , no .
no , you see it .
you see it , but you can' t believe it .
i can' t believe it because
come on , it doesn' t make sense .
why would they lie ?
because this way , max is all theirs .
they don' t have to consult you about anything .
sure , they' d lose a little money ... but it' s the power , that' s what they want .
they don' t have to consider us at all .
but if that' s how they feel about it ... why did they even try with us in the first place ?
i don' t know .
sentiment .
but then they thought better of it .
maybe we were too enthusiastic .
maybe we got excited and started talking about colleges ... or said something nice about sugar .
ok , then , you know , they changed their mind .
why not really use sperm from a sperm bank ?
because you' re a sure thing .
look at you .
you' re smart , you' re sexy .
you' re not faggy at all .
the gayest thing about you is me .
i' ve known pam since the eighth grade .
she wouldn' t lie .
she' s a mother .
it' s a sick , sick bond .
think of yours .
think of mine .
it' s unwholesome .
we have to call them .
no , no , they' il just deny it .
look , we have options .
we have plenty of options .
i think you should just let it sink in .
god !
i' m the boss of this , remember ?
you' re too emotional .
just ... trust me .
did you guys hear that thing on npr this morning ?
about sperm .
oh , no , no , no , i didn' t hear that one .
well , maybe it was yesterday .
what was that ?
just about storage and freezing and stuff .
pam , those jeans are great .
were those the ones
where did we get those ?
on melrose ?
those are the ones you picked out , the french ones .
they' re so good .
thanks .
do you guys know how long sperm keeps ?
no .
do tell .
twelve years .
what ?
yeah .
in the proper , you know , facility .
i don' t know what it would be at home .
did you hear the other story , though ?
it must have been after that , on the khmer rouge ... about that guy who was growing vegetables behind the torture room ?
no .
that was devastating .
i almost had to pull the car over .
was max in the car ?
yeah , but he was sleeping .
sugar , bad .
torture , fine .
is that big enough , right here ?
that' s great , that' s perfect for me .
can i get some ice cream with that ?
oh , absolutely .
i' il get it .
you know , there' s tofutti in there , too .
oh , good .
you should try it .
what are you still doing here ?
go play dominoes .
get me some scissors from the bathroom .
what ?
we can take a dna sample from his hair ... but i can' t pluck any without waking him .
what are you , crazy ?
just get away from him .
oh , my god , my car keys , i forgot this .
you' re not doing it .
just give me those .
yeah !
come on , this is gonna work .
charley !
listen , i know what those tests cost .
no , charley .
look at him , he' s so cute when he' s sleeping .
yeah .
how can you not believe this ?
look at him !
there' s a photograph of you at home looking just like this .
stick him in tinkerbell pj' s , it' s the spitting image .
what is the matter with you ?
jesus !
we are going to drop this , ok ?
look at him .
he' s happy , they' re happy , we' re happy .
just leave it alone , all right ?
yeah , but you believe me now .
no !
yeah .
i don' t .
promise me , all right ?
i don' t care if you' re positive about this .
just leave it alone .
i' m serious .
ok .
fine .
i' m not leaving here until you' re back in that living room .
go .
aw , man !
this is awesome !
i' m so going to buy this from you when we' re done .
no , forget it , ok ?
it' s all going back to the store ... before the credit card bill comes , ok ?
so don' t drop it .
that' s not funny .
don' t you know any of this stuff ?
oh , wow , you look really pretty if i stand far away and i use the zoom .
thank you .
ok , it' s back to normal now .
ok .
cool .
all right , here , gimme the camera .
ok , here , sure .
ok , but right now .
thank you .
all right , let' s see .
just have to open the program .
here it comes .
there it is !
who' s that handsome guy , huh ?
cool !
make it rewind through the computer .
ok , no !
not in my room !
all right ?
it' s this room , the bathroom , the kitchen .
everything else is off limits .
there .
you' re sleeping with javier .
you could' ve told me .
this is my boyfriend .
he' s a sex worker .
you' re embarrassed , huh ?
no , it' s none of your business .
and it doesn' t affect any of this , does it ?
wait , wait , wait , rewind , rewind , rewind .
hey , who' s that guy ?
oh , my ex husband .
still hung up on him ?
no .
that' s there to remind me what he' s like when he calls .
he lost $62, 000 that night .
that could' ve been my money !
yeah , that' s what really hurts about it .
does javier gamble ?
i don' t know .
i don' t care .
i' m not planning to marry him .
yeah , duh !
he' s creepy .
senor fingers !
i don' t want him handing me any cigarettes ... if you know what i mean .
so , you' re just into him for the sex .
' cause , i mean , i get that , you know .
he' s dangerous .
he' s , like ... gangs and handjobs and mexican .
i can see where that' d be attractive ... but , you know , you' ve married the bad boy before .
mr. vegas , huh ?
live and learn .
naturally , as my extortionist ... your insights are particularly valuable .
then why is he holding back , though ?
i mean , bring on the ring , dude !
like , he should marry you .
he should totally marry you .
you' re a step up .
ok .
well , this is in .
it' s in the hard drive .
when we' re done with this , we can edit .
watch .
don' t .
no , don' t .
oh , come on !
that' s not a zoom , incidentally .
just the way it is .
like a penis , only bigger .
who raised you ?
how lucky am i ?
i' m yours , and i don' t even care
how lucky am i ?
i' m young
with a few bucks to spare
and i don' t even try
i know it' s all in my mind
how lucky am i ?
i can' t believe all my good fortune
i count my blessings every day
should hurt to be so fun loving
my life must be a crime
how lucky am i ?
he says , " i can' t take 67 more of those !
how' s the food ?
thanks , mr. mckee .
it' s great .
yeah , we were just going to hit up taco bell .
well , it' s my pleasure .
you guys are good .
how' s the new amp ?
makes a difference , yeah .
you are really , really talented .
thank you .
i' m just trying to hang in there .
what do you mean ?
she' s just helping us out until rain gets out .
yeah , i need to get a real job , anyway .
i got evicted earlier this month .
actually , the guy that i was subletting with got evicted ... and none of my checks made it to the landlady ... so that was fun .
speaking of that , we should probably get you back to your cousin' s .
wait .
you' re not sleeping on someone' s couch ?
it' s an air bed .
you just push the button , boom , it' s full sized .
otis , what is the matter with you , dude ?
dude ?
listen , we got an empty pool house .
you move in there till you find a place .
oh , i don' t know .
we practice there , dad .
that' s what i' m saying .
it' s no use to me .
it' s got a big bedroom and a full bathroom .
you' il love it .
well , i don' t know .
i do .
it' s fine .
miles , you' il know this .
what would it take to get all you cats into a studio to cut a cd ?
seriously ?
seriously .
nice car .
well , my dad' s letting me run out the lease .
isn' t it nice not being a fag ?
this is the thing ...
i' il totally help you find a new place .
because this is temporary .
that' s what he said , until you find your own place .
oh , what' s it to you ?
what do you mean ?
this is too fast .
we' re sleeping together .
yeah , once .
it wasn' t that fast .
it was good .
i' m just saying we' ve got to be our own , independent people .
suddenly , we' re , like , living together ?
you know what ?
it' s fine .
' cause we' re breaking up .
what ?
look , i' m not going to screw you and your dad .
you' re not going to fuck my dad .
he is 44 , ok ?
so , the first guy i slept with was 38 and i was 13 .
my best friend' s dad .
you' re making that up .
that' s from american beauty .
it was exactly like that .
except i didn' t have roses coming out of my tits .
my dad has lots of girlfriends , and he spends money on them ... but he doesn' t marry them , so you can forget that .
why would i want to marry him ?
like that' s what i need a gay stepson .
you think i' m just going to let someone take advantage of my father ?
hey , butt boy , listen ... if you don' t help me with this ...
i' m going to tell him you' re gay ... and then you' il be out on your ass , not me , ok ?
so ...
first thing you gotta do is , you gotta break up with me ... because there' s no way your dad' s gonna fuck his son' s first real girlfriend .
he' s got morals .
yeah , well , i am dumping you , ok ?
just so you know .
yeah .
but let me tell you why .
breakfast ?
no , thanks .
thought you were out in the pool house .
why ?
otis , it' s ok if you want to spend the night with jude .
it' s fine .
you' re not a teenager anymore .
she get settled in all right ?
she' s moving out .
what ?
we broke up .
i mean , i broke up with her .
she' s moving back to her cousin' s ... and she might not even be in the band anymore .
i don' t know .
what happened ?
she lied to me about her age .
she' s not 24 , she' s 29 .
she' s too old .
she' s 29 ?
yeah , for another month .
i don' t want to date a 30 year old .
i' m 22 .
you know ?
i could be in college .
why would she lie about her age ?
i just assumed .
i don' t know .
anyway , she ... she wants to use the pool today .
i said it was ok .
her cousin' s at work , and she gave back her key .
well , i' m sorry things turned out this way .
i' m going over to alvin' s .
in the lexus .
sure , sure .
sure , whatever .
hey .
oh , hey , mr. mckee .
no , frank .
listen ...
i hear things are a little tricky .
yeah .
thanks for the pool house thing and all .
i don' t think it' s going to work out .
you know , i' d really hate to see you leave the band .
they really need you .
well , it' s kind of up to otis .
i could talk to him .
i mean , every woman lies about her age a little bit .
that' s what he told you it was about ?
man , it' s not that .
he' s got someone else .
lane .
lane ?
that' s a girl' s name ?
he didn' t tell you anything about her ?
you don' t know your son very well , do you ?
well , i don' t think you should leave .
i insist you stay .
i' m going to talk to otis ...
' cause that' s no way to treat somebody you care about .
i wish he was more like you .
well , he' s young , and maybe i could have done a better job .
but i was a kid when i had him , practically .
do you know what ?
you remind me of the first boy i dated .
hardly a boy .
now you' re lying .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
yeah , that' s why i' ve been behaving so weird lately .
you know .
we both have .
i just i i can' t even believe this .
i can' t believe we' re having this conversation .
all right .
so ... what kind of disease ?
he won' t say , you know ?
he
it' s neurological , he told me that .
oh , my god .
yeah .
hereditary .
all the males in his family have to be tested for it .
do you i mean , what' s the name of it ?
it' s not ms , i know that .
well , is it like ms ?
well , it' s ... i don' t know .
are you forgetting the name of it ?
he didn' t want me to interfere , you know ?
he just thought i would be , you know ... that i would be on the internet ... and i' d be talking to doctors and nagging him .
like i' m that guy , you know .
i' m not that guy .
all right .
what are the symptoms ?
do you know the symptoms ?
yeah .
did you know gil' s grandfather ... when you were at high school together ?
no .
i don' t think so .
i don' t i don' t even remember gil talking about him or mentioning him .
well , i' m not surprised .
it' s pretty debilitating .
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
hey , it' s not fatal .
it' s ok .
it' s not ?
no , no , no .
it' s just untreatable .
yeah .
all right .
so , when i mean , what do we do ?
pam , you mustn' t say that we you can' t tell him we spoke .
oh , god .
all right .
i mean , i yeah .
he would kill me if he knew we' d spoken .
oh , my god .
max !
max ?
i' ve got to go pick him up .
i gotta get myself together .
that' s the one comfort we have .
what ?
you know , that you guys couldn' t get pregnant ... with gil' s , you know .
like your body knew somehow .
just said ... not allowed .
i gotta go .
i gotta go .
sorry .
hey , pam , i think it' s going to be ok .
i gotta say , man , i' m glad she' s not here for first day ...
' cause she' s , like , opinionated .
all right .
what did you do to your face , man ?
what do you mean ?
you got a fake moustache on .
oh , yeah .
you like it ?
it' s so my clients don' t notice me , you know ?
it' s a little make up , too , that mamie has .
mamie' s white , ok ?
you look like a scared mexican .
like , down at the border on the news .
hey , come on .
that' s my face up there , ok ?
it' s gonna look good through the camera .
just shoot .
it' s cool , man .
i don' t know how it' s gonna read .
i guess
come on .
i gotta go .
well , it looks all right .
ok .
we' re rolling , we' re rolling .
came up with a list of questions that , you know ... everybody who' s ever gotten a massage , i' m sure , wants to know .
have you had a massage , ever ?
yeah , i have .
actually , let' s start with that .
what do you do when somebody lets one out ... while you' re massaging them ?
do you just keep going ?
is that what the incense is for ?
take me through that .
you farted today inside .
no .
you said it was her !
cut !
you know something ?
women don' t fart like that , my friend .
do me a favor ?
take a picture of me .
i forgot , i wanted to do it before .
so we' il get back to this .
ready ?
your fly' s open .
good .
here we go .
what' s it like ... when some woman you' re massaging lets one out ?
ok , they' re cooked all the way now .
i didn' t know .
i like ' em pink .
ok .
maybe we have five minutes , in a montage ... with music covering the stupidity .
we shot for two hours .
yeah , and it' s garbage .
nicky , who cares who invented that donut that people put their face in ?
it' s called a cradle , ok ?
a face cradle , and i think it' s interesting .
and farts ?
and who pays for the lotion ?
and , so , ok , how do people tip you ?
because they' re naked , so where' s the wallet ?
that' s neat , ok ?
the little envelopes at the front desk ?
i didn' t know that .
all right .
do you want to get into film school ?
yeah .
because i don' t care .
i just have to help you make a documentary .
as good as the one you' re not letting me make .
no .
no .
just a documentary .
if you want a stupid interview ... that you could see on the local news , fine .
but if you want this to be good ... if you want people to care about him ... you have to have a point of view .
i have a point of view !
this guy has it made , and i care ... because i want to see him get all these ladies off .
that' s your reasoning ?
yes !
oh , ok .
all right .
well , i' m relieved .
what does that mean ?
it means someone smart would be harder to please .
but if you' re stupid , hey , just makes my job easier .
what did you just call me ?
forget it .
it' s ok .
you know , you say " stupid " too much .
i just mean , i think you' re better than this ... or you could be .
yeah , well i think that goes for everybody ... from what i can see from right here .
anyway , the makeup blows .
i' il give you that .
it' s no fun thinking of him nailing all these women ... if he might be a homo , but that' s just me .
that' s my beer .
sorry .
it' s ok .
ok .
all right .
it' s gonna be ok .
all right , well , it' s gonna be good .
we' il just go through it again .
i got two hours of footage .
yeah .
will you do me a favor , for my sanity ?
will you just say to me
please just say to me right now ... five minutes was an overestimation .
jesus christ .
time to go .
hey , charley .
that was pam and diane from the car .
they' re on their way over .
i thought we were seeing them tonight at jill' s .
they say they have something to tell us .
wow .
that was fast .
you know , don' t you ?
all right , guys .
i don' t know where to begin .
oh , well ...
so ...
look , you know , these things , they just get out of hand .
i mean , you know , you want to tell ... you want to get it off your chest .
and i' m sure every night you think you will ... and it just gets harder and harder .
