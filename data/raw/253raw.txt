not one problem .
i already got mine picked out at the shelter .
good for you , o. great job .
yeah , that' s great .
terrific .
listen , can we talk for a second ?
don' t you think that it makes more sense to wait until after we move to the new place before we get the dog ?
i' m just thinking of the dog .
that way , he won' t have to relearn a new house and a new neighborhood and all that other newness .
we had a deal , mom .
we did .
we sure ... we sure ... we absolutely did .
the best way to achieve your goals , owen , is to make a plan , work hard , and always keep your eyes on the prize .
that' s an exact quote , isn' t it ?
i want my prize .
so , shall we all go to the shelter at noon ?
yes !
yes !
this' il be great for him , right ?
yeah , yeah .
a little buddy is just what he needs .
i better put down some newspaper .
yeah , yeah , yeah .

i am canid 3942 .
honey !
was that you ?
you better be up and at ' em .
don' t say a word .
you can' t forget the other dogs just because you' ve got hubble .
bless you !
somebody' s got a wittle cold .
poor baby .
hop to it , o.
can we tie her up out back , please ?
did you just learn how to talk ?
here come the questions .
let' s just say your hearing suddenly got a lot better .
oh , man .
how is this even possible ?
oh , boy .
look , i don' t have time to train you right now .
just take me to your leaders .
leaders ?
the dogs who walk you .
i walk them .
sure you do .
i' il get to the bottom of this .
wait .
am i the only one who can understand you ?
okay , it was a big mistake ... wasn' t meant to happen .
you can' t tell anyone about this , ever .
got it ?
this was a major boo boo .
nobody' d believe me anyway .
it' s not like dogs start talking all of a sudden .
code red !
code red !
the kid can hear us talking ?
watch out , shorty .
coming through .
you can really understand me ?
right now , you understand what i am saying to you ?
yep .
can i have a cookie ?
no , wait .
ten cookies ?
no , can i have twenty cookies ?
be a pal , kid .
loosen my collar a notch .
i got a foof in my chach .
owen , honey , can we just talk about how pretty i am ?
oh , oh , shoot !
i' m so nervous , i forgot what i was gonna say .
i know what i wanna ask .
can you teach us how to work a stinkin ' can opener ? !
enough !
collect yourselves .
i knew he was trouble the minute i sniffed his butt .
oh , my !
i have come here on an important mission from the home star , and i expect full cooperation .
hold it .
where are you from ?
where we all came from ... the home star .
unbelievable .
it' s true .
what are you talking about ?
thousands of years ago , dogs arrived here from the home star to colonize and dominate the planet .
all earth dogs are descended from those dogs .
what home star ? !
this is why dogs and people shouldn' t talk .
dude , you never heard of the dog star ?
it' s called sirius .
wait , you know about this , too ?
my grandma used to tell me stories .
we' ve all heard them .
my great grandfather told me he had to pass through uranus to get here .
you expect me to believe that there' s a planet out there made up of only dogs ?
we don' t expect much from your species .
now go outside and play so we can do our business .
go play , boy .
i don' t have to go outside .
pardon me , but you were saying something about a mission ?
right .
thank you .
i have been sent here to file a report on earth dogs .
what , like a report card ?
yes .
now , sit !
i will observe your lives and then grade you on how you have upheld the sirius code of dignity and dominance .
we' re going to get graded ?
yes , and i' il be submitting my report directly to our most noble pack leader ... the greater dane .
what ?
the top dog ? !
canine in chief .
i need to pee pee .
the greater dane is upset by rumors floating around the galaxy recently that earth dogs may have strayed from their original mission and lost control of this planet .
there' s even one crazy rumor we' ve heard that claims humans keep dogs as pets .
oh , my !
that is crazy .
isn' t that crazy ?
super crazy .
who would say a crazy thing like that ?
hold on !
you don' t honestly think that dogs are in charge ...
can we get some air ?
i feel a little woozy .
see this ?
i bought it .
i clip it on you because you are my dog .
i own you .
pay no attention to the dude in the red suit .
the idea of dogs being in charge is so ... far fetched .
fetch ? !
i teach you and i tell you what you can and can' t do .
understand ?
dude , i' m wide open !
throw the ball .
throw the frisbee .
throw the stick .
throw something , player !
yeah , i know what you think , but that' s not the way it works here .
baker !
who are you talkin ' to ?
yeah .
just the dogs .
you' re talkin ' like they' re people .
you' ve got to ... to train them .
let' s just go .
connie , i wouldn' t let my dog hang out with that mental case .
what a mental .
that' s it !
you guys are makin ' me look nuts .
all this stupid dog star talk , the greater dane .
i want proof .
show me proof .
works for me .
you know how to drive ?
he knows how to crash .
i' m an excellent pilot .
there happened to be some radical wind currents the other night .
hold on .
what' s this thing ?
be careful .
that' s my woofer .
a communicator .
it got slightly damaged in the landing .
slightly ? !
hey , let' s see you fly one .
this is what you were using last night ?
yes , when it short circuited and you were caught in the current .
don' t remind me .
now i' m talking to you , but i can' t contact sirius .
i bet i could fix this .
you keep your paws off my woofer , mister .
no , really .
i' m good with this kind of stuff .
i mean , let' s face it .
i can' t make it any worse .
fine .
that' il be your job .
as for the rest of you , tomorrow i start grading .
i want to see all the ways you' ve taken control of people and the planet .
absolutely .
no problem !
we' il show ya !
you guys are so busted .
see ya tomorrow !
whoops .
if you don' t know what you' re doing ...
chill out , hubble .
my name is canid 3942 .
i' m not calling you by some number .
i named you hubble .
when did these human dog relationships start anyway ?
thousands of years ago .
why on earth would we do that ?
believe it or not , dogs here are called " man' s best friend .
friend ?
dogs don' t need friends .
everybody needs friends .
why ?
i' m probably not the best person to ask , considering i don' t have any .
hey !
you two havin ' a chat in here ?
yeah .
ha ha .
here' s a boy .
whoa , careful !
knock this over , we' il all get pretty goofy in here .
don' t play around with this stuff .
your mom and i will be finishing up in the dining room tomorrow .
then it' s moving time again .
i think this house is my favorite so far .
me too .
you okay ?
i' m okay .
okey dokey , then .
all right , buddy , sleep tight .
you , too , stubborn hubble .
i think he understood me .
if one more person wipes their hands on me ...
did you ...
i drank out of that bowl .
all i' m asking is for a little respect .
why do you do that ?
because i need sleep .
why do you turn around like that ?
enough with the questions .
we' ve got a big day tomorrow .
lights out .
hubble ?
just one more .
how could dogs run an entire planet all on their own ?
i mean , no offense , but you guys don' t have that much intelligence .
oh , really ?
who' s been teaching who all day long , mr. genius ?
you may know about where you live , but i know a lot more about where i live .
one thing i do know is that dogs don' t run things .
wait until you see how we got things runnin ' down here .
we' re gonna give you a grand tour .
i' m not shaking because i' m nervous .
i' m shaking because i' m excited .
excuse me .
i have to go first , please .
why ?
because , honey , you do not want to deal with me until i' ve had my day at the beauty parlor .
you see , here on earth , we pick people to do the things that matter most ... hair , nails , accessories .
we have our own back scratchers .
i' ve got my own chauffeur .
i got my own personal shopper .
charge it !
they make the sandwiches , i eat them .
they warm up the seats , and i lay on ' em .
they plant the trees , i pee on ' em .
we get what we want .
we do what we want .
we go where we want .
it may look to you like people are in charge , but let' s face it ... you don' t see us pickin ' up their poop .
okay , that last one got me .
pretty cool , huh ?
so , what do you think , mr. space dog ?
you' re all pets .
lazy , greedy , spoiled rotten good for nothings .
you' ve lost all dignity .
will this affect our report card ?
what do you think ?
now i have no choice .
i have to flunk you .
flunk us ?
flunk them ?
we can' t flunk .
that' d be very bad .
pardon me , mr. hubble .
we' ve been away from the home star so long .
maybe if you helped us refresh our memory a little ?
yes !
be our teacher , hubble .
not my job .
i make my report , and i go .
go ?
he' s leaving ?
what do you mean , go ?
mission command will send a retriever for me eventually .
then we still have some time to improve .
please help us , hubble .
we don' t want to flunk .
we want to be more like you .
absolutely !
intelligent , dignified .
who are we kidding ?
we could only dream of being as dignified as hubble .
i don' t know about that .
i may be an old dog , but i like to learn new tricks .
oh , please !
please , please , please , pretty please .
come on .
please .
i usually don' t approve of begging , but i could teach them a thing or two .
hubble' s our teacher !
but no funny business .
understand ?
tomorrow , you start getting serious .
it' s your class , teach .
you' re the dog .
i didn' t realize i' d made such an impression on them .
they really seem to look up to me .
that' s the thing about earth dogs .
if they like you , they' re not afraid to let you know .
another fine example of the intelligence of human beings ?
ta da !
wow !
i know .
finally , right ?
i can' t wait to get started on the new place in metro village .
so soon ?
it' s our dream home , honey .
i can' t wait to get in there and get started .
but that' s what you said about this house , mom , and the house before that and the one before that .
it' s what we do , sweetheart .
you know that .
i know .
i just wish we could stay somewhere , just once , for good .
it makes more sense financially to live in the place that we' re renovating .
smile .
and besides , every time we move , we get a nicer place , right ?
but this place seems nice enough to me .
sweetheart , that' s a lovely compliment , but i bet you' re gonna like the new place best of all .
honey , can you move out ?
i want to get the painting by itself .
thank you .
good .
and this time , you won' t be starting off all alone ,
' cause you' il have hubble .
hello .
i was just ...
where were you ?
with my mom .
why do you care ?
why do dogs howl at the moon ?
only coyotes do that , but it' s not the moon .
they' re howling to the home star .
sirius ?
just to the left , two stars over .
coyotes are homesick cry babies .
so when that retriever you talked about comes for you , you' re planning on going back with him ?
this is only a temporary mission .
right .
i get it .
i appreciate your hosting me for the time being , but ...
it' s okay .
i' m used to temporary missions .
all right , class , lesson number one .
dignity comes from within .
on sirius , we begin every day with meditation , easing gently into peaceful poses to achieve a higher state of being and release our more base animal impulses .
shh !
surrender .
breathe in , breathe out .
in and out .
relax .
let it go .
whoop !
pardon me .
shep eats people food sometimes .
how lucky for us .
this one' s outta the park .
erase all distractions from your mind .
hey , was that a ball ?
i coulda swore i just heard a ball .
focus is the key to canine composure .
was that a ball ?
i do believe there was a ball .
i' m pretty sure that was a ball .
i think i need to get it .
you ain' t gettin ' nothin ' !
back off , boxer , it' s mine !
it' s my ball !
what happened ?
what did i miss ?
did i miss something ?
baker !
watch this .
gimme back my ball .
i don' t have it .
why don' t you talk to your dogs and tell ' em to give it back ?
talk to ' em , dog boy .
what a freak !
your dog' s a freak like you .
get him !
don' t , you guys .
quit it .
who' s gonna make me ?
connie ?
whatcha gonna do now , baker ?
call ' em off , baker .
call ' em off .
just get up slowly .
those dogs bite us , and my dad' il sue .
give me the ball , wilson .
here .
but i bet they come after you for it .
keep it .
i don' t care .
is this your only one ?
just keep it .
guess you guys don' t have any balls then .
we catch you without ' em , you' re dead meat .
you' re really dead meat .
run , run !
they' re such total jerks .
why do you hang out with them ?
i don' t know .
we grew up together .
i could hang out with you , i guess .
could you watch the dogs ?
i' m gonna check on hubble .
cool .
you all right ?
why did you step in like that ?
they were throwing rocks at you .
sirius dogs fight their own battles .
why would you put yourself at risk for me ?
because ... you' re my dog .
besides , that' s what friends do , right ?
you backed me up , too .
i did , didn' t i ?
why would i do a stupid thing like that ?
i think they wanna play ball .
want this ?
is this what you want ?
doesn' t your dog wanna play ?
i don' t think he knows how .
or maybe he' s not good enough .
look .
he wants to try .
okay .
go get it .
i can do this .
i got it !
what am i doin ' ?
i got it !
wait , wait , wait .
now i get it .
that was just practice .
barbara ann got it .
do over .
let' s go one more time .
do it again !
this one' s all yours , hub .
this one' s all mine .
all mine .
eat my dust .
bad bounce .
that was a bad bounce .
bad bounce .
you can do this .
i know you can .
show ' em , hub .
show ' em what you' re made of .
let me try this one more time .
i can do it .
i can .
i' il show ' em .
i' il show ' em .
i got the ball !
holy guacamole !
good splash !
is he all right ?
showoff !
can you teach me that ?
is that water clean ?
he' s fine .
fine ? !
he just took off like a 747 .
yeah , he' s a good leaper , like those dogs with the frisbees .
owen , dogs don' t fly .
now what is up with your dog ?
you won' t believe me .
i know how to keep a secret .
works for me .
we had an agreement .
you weren' t going to tell anybody about this .
hey , don' t blame me .
i wasn' t the one who jumped 500 feet in front of her .
i was just going for the ball .
hubble , you were flying .
we have stronger gravity on sirius .
ouch !
it' s much bigger than earth .
you' re like an astronaut on the moon .
you can jump higher and farther .
i can do lots of things .
what i can' t do is catch that infuriating bouncy ball .
wait a second .
so that rock around your neck ... is this from outer space ?
we all wear them .
it' s a token .
what' s it mean ?
it means ... home .
ouch !
here , lay down a minute .
we have to work on the woofer .
ouch .
hey , don' t ...
would you just ...
that' s why you got those thumbs .
you' re a very nice person , owen .
thanks .
we really should get back ... to work ... woofer .
shep , you can' t fly .
you can try all you want .
you' re an earth dog .
three , two , one ... blast off !
up , up , and away !
barbara ann !
we' re sort of concerned about what he might be teaching ...
wilson !
i believe i can fly !
tony ?
tony !
stupid thing .
i got it .
i got it , too .
see what my dad built for you ?
if you lived here , you' d have your very own house .
get back here .
39423942
don' t touch .
must be some sort of code .
aren' t you 3942 ?
oh , 3942 .
i' m here .
this is 3942 .
3942 . please resporhd i am responding .
i don' t think they can hear you .
visitatiorh corhfirmed
arrival of the greater darhe corhfirmed
oh , no .
arrival ?
repeat .
greater darhe arrivirhg when ?
when ?
when ?
hey , it' s getting late , guys .
what was that ?
nothing .
you all right ?
you' re lookin ' a little pale .
no , i' m fine .
yeah , i' m fine .
the greater dane is coming here .
oh , this is bad .
she is not going to be happy .
the greater dane is a she ?
of course .
wow !
it' s all over now .
she' s going to expect a proper welcome , a grand tour .
so ?
we' il do it .
we' il give it to her .
you don' t understand .
when she sees what i' ve seen here , she' il give the order .
what order ?
come on , hubble .
tell me .
what' s the worst thing she can do ?
global recall .
global what ?
recall .
all earth dogs will be ordered back to sirius for punishment and retraining .
she can' t do that .
it' il be gradual .
city by city , day after day , but trust me , she can .
why would she ?
i told you .
earth dogs are not supposed to be pets .
all dogs ... gone .
we can' t let that happen .
it won' t be up to us .
no , i mean , we can work with the dogs .
you can teach them how to give a royal welcome , and we' il come up with something that shows her how dogs run things .
i' il even act like i' m your pet if i have to .
no , sir .
i am in enough trouble already with her .
no way .
what did you do wrong ?
us talking right now ... that' s a problem , remember ?
i did that .
is it chilly out here for you , nelly ?
we' il take you inside , warm you up .
i know it' s hard to imagine a world without dogs , owen , but you can' t fix things that are beyond your control .
i' m not trying to .
but if you go away and all the rest of the dogs go away ... ... then ... then ...
who' s gonna be your best friend ?
when the greater dane arrives , we must welcome her with dignified pageantry .
your pride and honor should burst forth .
oh , shep !
sorry .
spaghetti and meatballs .
that' s it !
this is hopeless .
you' re all leaving earth forever .
hubble ...
not now .
i' m yelling .
that' s what' s gonna happen if you don' t straighten up .
this is the greater dane , not some cockapoo or shih tzu .
she' il have you strung up by your tails .
strung up ?
not my tail .
what did he say ?
he' s a little stressed out .
let me talk to them for a moment .
you all understand that you' re being asked to prove yourselves , right ?
to prove that you' re worthy to live here , to stay with the people you love .
we want that more than anything .
we' il do whatever we need to do .
i know you will .
just do your best .
they usually respond better to a little ... encouragement .
let' s start over .
when the dane passes , you must bow low before her .
no one' s head should ever be higher than hers .
let' s practice .
i' il play her .
thank you .
thank you , earth dogs .
nice to see you .
i' m pleased to visit your fair planet .
oh , isn' t it lovely to be here ?
la dee dah , la dee dah , et cetera and so forth .
not bad .
not bad ?
that was cool .
it was good , actually .
i want to encourage you all to keep practicing .
it' s an attitude ... dignified , serious .
now , have you figured out a way to convince her we' re in charge ?
connie had an idea .
tell him your plan .
whenever a great leader visits the white house , they give a formal dinner .
it' s so lovely getting together like this , earth dogs .
we should do it more often .
it' s hard for me , your majesty .
i summer here , but i winter in miami .
yes , i summer here , too , but i winter in my poopie .
whoa , nelly .
that was embarrassing .
i' m fine .
bring on the first course .
oh , my !
they got steak .
i did say i was hungry enough to eat a cow .
my compliments to the chef .
that' s a sausage , right , not a hot dog .
a hot dog would be wrong .
can i just have a bite right now ?
medium rare .
look it .
control .
control .
shep .
your majesty , i would like to apologize in advance for any farting .
is that chicken bits ?
no , sweetheart , that' s pt .
what is she talkin ' about , pa tay ?
it' s french for meat byproduct .
ooh , pass me the pt .
i must say , the humans are much more domesticated than i expected .
thank you very much , ma' am .
has any other greater dane ever visited earth before this ?
you' re talking to me .
that can' t happen .
oh , yeah .
right .
it' s been ages since the last visit .
i betcha this will be the fanciest welcome any dane' s ever gotten .
we are in deep diddily doo doo .
hey , o. , lookin ' pretty spiffy there .
hey , honey , we got a very big day tomorrow .
we' re gonna sell , sell , sell .
sell , sell , sell .
focus .
eyes on the ball .
be the ball .
all right , hub .
go to bed .
i' m just saying , i think i could get pretty good at this game .
what' s the point if you' re not gonna be here long enough to play ?
oh , right .
it' s just a silly game anyway .
are you ... agitated ?
yep , but it' s not about you .
don' t worry .
you want a biscuit ?
no .
it' s hard to leave home .
i know .

there' s nothing more important than me working with the dogs right now .
we' ve gotten some interesting calls lately from the neighbors .
a particularly interesting one from connie' s mother last night .
your dad and i think it' s time to wrap it up with the neighborhood dogs .
but , mom , the dogs need me now more than ever .

whoa !

yoo hoo !
smile .
cute .
that was a sonic boom ?
yeah .
doesn' t make sense , though .
owen , change that shirt .
i need you to pass out fact folders to the guests .
when i was a kid , i used to hear that a lot , but we lived near an air force base .
that ... that is weird .
owen , tick tock .
thank you .
great .
thanks a lot .
mom .
mom .

mom .

don' t you know who this is ?
look sharp !
your majesty , what a lovely surprise .
we were all wondering when you were gonna get your royal heinie down here .

i' il bite him if you want me to .
you have a lot of explaining to do , 3942 .
3942 .
that' s my number .
i' m not here right now .
please leave a message .
pull yourself together , canid .
i' m sorry .
i' m totally serious now .
i' m ...
sirius !
isn' t there one among you who knows how to give your leader a proper welcome ?
oh , you' re all dog meat now .
all of you , come with me .
earth dogs .
and you , 3942 .
what a disgrace .
what' s happening ?
nothing good .
if it makes you feel any better , we all knew you were gonna screw up .
back !
yes , ma' am .
right away , ma' am .
yes , ma' am .
every rumor i' ve heard about our species on this planet appears to be true .
no dominance , no dignity .
we had something formal planned for you .
we had something formal ...
shut your yap !
enough .
your little welcome party was highly revealing , 3942 .
i have no choice but to give the order for global recall .
no .
i' ve seen all i need to see .
wait !
no , you haven' t .
you haven' t .
you can' t take them away .
please .
dogs mean so much to the world , and you haven' t seen any of that yet .
they protect us , and they keep us company , and they always warn us if something bad might happen .
some dogs even work with police and firefighters , and do amazing things ... things people could never do on their own .
some dogs even help people who can' t see by guiding them .
we rely on them for so much .
you should be proud of them , because people love dogs .
did you know that ?
people and dogs love each other .
i am still curious as to why a human boy is talking with me .
funny story .
you did this ?
it' s not hubble' s fault .
i mean , 3942 .
it' s not his fault .
you better step down , owen .
i' m sorry .
but please , think about what i said .
love ?
here they come .
hubble .
what happened ?
she decided to go home .
is it all over ?
it' s all over .
yes !
you did it , owen !
wait .
what about you , hubble ?
are you ... here ?
i' m ... here .
i don' t believe it .
i thought i blew it .
where' s everybody going ?
i think everyone' s tired .
oh .
well , we can celebrate later , right ?
now we can play ball , hub .
i know it won' t be easy not going back to sirius , but it' s not where you are .
it' s who you' re with , right ?
yeah .
what is it , shep ?
my pretty ladybird .
wilson ?
that' s my girl .
my sweet nelly .
yeah , you are sweet .
what ?
i know i haven' t been the most affectionate dog .
it' s okay .
you' re different , hub .
i like that about you .
but i' ve seen the way others express themselves to their people , and ...
i want you to know , i do like you .
i' m just not used to all the customs here .
hubble , it' s all right .
you just told me you liked me .
how many people get to hear that from their dog ?
owen .
honey .
mom ?
honey , miss ryan is at the door .
she wants to talk to you .
what about ?
i know barbara ann' s every move .
i know everywhere she would go .
you don' t understand .
it' s as if she simply vanished .
nelly !
nelly !
oh , no .
you' re not saying owen took the dogs ?
no .
no , no , no .
he lost his dog , too .
i just don' t understand how he could know nothing about what happened .
now you' re moving away .
where does that leave us ?
it' s not owen' s fault .
connie , go inside .
he tried to stop them .
stop who , connie ?
who took them ?
the dogs .
the other dogs .
from outer space .
maybe it is best that you' re leaving .
it' s because of all this constant moving we' ve been doing , isn' t it ?
i' m sure it' s not helping .
the deal on the house hasn' t officially closed yet .
it' s not too late to change our minds .
what do we do ?
here you go .
the movers will be here at 10 : 00 tomorrow .
where' s your cap ?
i can' t find it .
owen , you know we' il get you another dog .
and soon .
that' s a promise .
maybe i' m not supposed to have one , mom .
don' t say that .
nobody deserves a dog more than you .
arhd firhally torhight .
file this urhder " odd
there' s beerh a drastic irhcrease irh reports of lost dogs all over the state recerhtly
authorities are baffled by this rash of disappeararhces .
but say they' re doirhg their best to " srhiff out " the culprits
we ' see you tomooiow n ght
hubble , i' m sorry .
i let you down .
i should' ve kept quiet up on that hill .
i hope i didn' t get you in trouble by talking .
i didn' t think of ...
i just didn' t think .
now everyone' s losing their dogs , and it' s all my fault .
i know you can' t hear me .
i miss you so much .
i never had a friend like you .
i wanted you to stay here with me so badly .
but i ...
i know you have your home there .
i hope i didn' t screw everything up for you .
i hope they' re not being mean to you .
because you' re a good boy , hubble .
you are .
you' re a good boy .
you are .
you' re a good boy .
i have often wondered what it was about human beings that could lead so many of our species astray ... what it is that makes us abandon our drive for dominance .
go on , 3942 .
speak .
enlighten me .
i think it' s friendship .
people and dogs live side by side on earth , and they make a home together .
a home ?
it seems that inspires great loyalty .
i must ask you now ... where does your loyalty lie ?
3942 .
i prefer the name hubble .
owen , it' s time to go .
bye .
bye .
dad , was that another sonic boom ?
no , that was just the movers closing the door .
come on , buddy .
we really need to get goin ' .
dad .
sorry about that .
pothole .
no , that was too big of a noise .
owen .
it was too big of a noise .
dad , stop .
wait !
what is it ?
stop the car .
i forgot something .
what ?
owen !
hey !
owen !
something' s going on .
where are you going ?
the dogs !
the dogs !
what ?
the dogs .
i know i heard it .
i know i heard it .
please .
please .
what was that ?
now , wait a minute .
look at that cloud up there !
look at that cloud !
look , the sky !
what is that ?
yes !
here , boy .
over here .
this button , right ?
you broke it .
don' t touch that .
i know what i' m doing !
wait .
wait !
listen .
is that the dogs ?
we' re home !
i missed ya , owen .
there' s my main man .
it' s good to see you .
it was a long flight .
that' s the last time i travel in a spaceship .
there she is !
there she is !
hey there , mama !
hey , guys , i' m back !
hello , papa .
look , mom , he' s back .
say hi , shep .
are you here ... ... to stay ?
yep .
the greater dane declared earth dogs an entirely different breed .
i ... really missed you .
i know .
i heard .
you heard ?
i think you' re a good boy , too .
i almost forgot .
she said i could stay on one condition .
whoa !
was that your woofer again ?
hubble ?
hubble .
i have so many more questions to ask you .
how am i gonna know what you' re thinking ?
start unpacking .
we' re home for good .
yeah .
hubble , good boy .
good boy .
