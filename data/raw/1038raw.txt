do you know the expression " a man' s man " ?
a man' s man is the leader of the pack .
the kind of man other men look up to , admire and emulate .
a man' s man is the kind of man who ... [ chuckles ] just doesn' t get what women are about .
nick , my ex husband , is the ultimate man' s man .
i probably never should have married him .
i don' t think he understood a thing about me .
so , this is nick marshall' s office .
wanna peek ?
don' t worry .
he never gets in before 10 : 00 .
he' il send you on more errands than anyone in the entire company ...
' cause he can' t do anything for himself .
he' s like this total bachelor and the least politically correct guy in the universe .
he' s the king of all the t& a ads we do .
you want babes in bikinis ?
he' s your man .
my dad ?
how can i best describe him ?
he' s always been ...
like an uncle to me .
yeah , uncle dad .
although , nick was a charmer .
completely irresistible at first , which feeds into the whole " man' s man " thing .
you know about nick' s mother , right ?
because once you understand about nick' s mother , you understand nick .
nick was actually born and raised in las vegas .
nick' s mother was a real , honest to god las vegas showgirl .
when other boys were outside riding their bikes and playing ball ,
nick was backstage hanging with the girls .
he was their mascot , their little pet .
they couldn' t get enough of those baby blues .
bang !
bang !
if you ask me , i' d say nick' s mother just about killed it ... for every woman nick would ever meet .
she had a lot of sugar daddies in her life , but only one true love the boy with the family jewels .
17 , 18 , 19 , 20 .
let me see that , kid .
and since nick didn' t have a father , his mom made sure he was always surrounded by strong male role models .
come here , huh ?
men her little boy could really look up to .
now you' re ready , huh ?
keep countin ' , kid .
there was nothing normal about the way nick marshall was raised .
so , what can you expect ?
you don' t have to be freud to figure out ... this was one cockeyed way to enter the world .
oh !
don' t you ever knock ?
it' s almost 10 : 00 .
you gotta go to work , and i gotta vacuum in here .
and don' t forget another one who wears vanilla perfume .
don' t you know any women who don' t want to smell like candy ?
toss me my lighter , could you babe ?
babe ?
what am i , a little pig ?
i don' t have time to make you no onion bagel , so please do not start to beg , okay ?
and just for the record , i don' t like finding these things in your sofa .
what kind of woman wears underwear like this ?
hey , my mother wore underwear like that , alright ?
just put them somewhere , will you , babe ?
well , " babe " is gonna put it in the trash where it belongs .
so , your mother should excuse me .
did you ever consider dating a woman who wears real underwear ?
you know , the kind that covers the entire bottom the way it' s supposed to ?
no .
but if i ever do , should i give you a call ?
oh !
i' m gonna go clean the kitchen .
you couldn' t toast me a little bagel , could you ?
light cream cheese , tomatoes .
capers if we have any .
please !
come on .
you know i can' t think on an empty stomach .
okay .
all right .
but only because you didn' t call me that pig name .
okay , you got it , babe .
mr. marshall , how are you doing today ?
i' m fit as a dancing bear .
i' il get that cab for you .
that' s some set of pipes you got .
you have an excellent day , sir .
and you .
at ease .
oh , oh , i' m so sorry !
i absolutely did not mean to do that .
here .
let me get that for you .
it' s okay .
no , i' m mortified .
i can see your hands are full .
thank you .
sorry .
let me get the door .
thank you .
thank you .
halfcup , grande , nonfat , thick foam , wet cap , no lid .
halfcaff " , grande , nonfat , thick foam , wet cap , no lid .
so , when do you find out ?
um , today , i think .
unless i didn' t get it , and then i will just never find out .
i' m sure i didn' t get it .
they were looking for an " earth mother " type .
i overheard the director say i was more space cadet .
i' m an actress .
i can be whatever you want .
is that true , can you ?
oh , better be true .
otherwise , i' m stuck playing ditsy coffee shop girl the rest of my life .
thank you .
hon ?
thanks .
oh !
hi , nick .
hi .
oh , lola , my love .
when are you gonna let me buy you dinner ?
nick , i don' t know why you don' t believe me .
i' m not your type .
trust me on this one .
cappuccino , extra foam .
tall or grande ?
grande .
or at least i like to think so .
next .
you know , rumor has it ...
i' m getting some really big news at work today .
why don' t you at least come out with me .
celebrate .
i' il buy you a cup of coffee .
i work in a coffee shop .
hi .
what can i get you ?
hi .
i' il take  want me to stop asking you out ?
sorry .
this will just take a sec .
because , lola , give me the word and i' il stop .
yes , i' m gonna give you the word because i' m an actress .
or at least i' m trying to be one .
i' m trying to concentrate on that .
so , you know , it would be a good thing , if you wouldn' t mind , to stop asking me out !
honey , you seem so stressed .
i am stressed .
i have a lot on my plate .
so , let' s not talk about this now .
why don' t i meet you here , say , tomorrow ?
10 : 00 ?
10 : 30 ?
okay , that would be good .
so , that' s a date ?
it' s a date .
thank you .
sir , that was inspiring .
i know .
good morning , sloane curtis .
good morning , mr. marshall .
hi , honey .
what' s the dirt ?
i was at breakfast this morning
hey , norm !
you winning ?
of course .
i heard miller' s shopping around , looking for a new agency .
miller lite .
i know .
i' m all over it .
also , i heard darcy mcguire left b. b. d. & o. good morning , angela .
you' re kidding .
left or was fired ?
i don' t know .
everyone there is thrilled to get rid of her .
well , so much for edgy female vision .
so , that girl we met last night at the club , nothing happened after you put her in the cab , right ?
it did ?
something happened ?
but she said she had to be in bed early .
i had her in bed by 11 : 00 .
or was it quarter to ?
you you' re like a genius , you know that ?
what can i tell you , buddy ?
i' m blessed .
and today is my lucky day .
not only is my ex wife gigi remarrying right now , as a matter of fact but wanamaker called me himself , wanted to see me first thing .
called twice to confirm .
call me when he makes it official .
it' s not gonna be as easy to suck up to " creative director " , you know .
not to worry .
i' il make us a lunch rez at the drake to celebrate .
don' t count your chickens , huh ?
1 : 00 ?
pick you up .
can i borrow this ?
hey , dina .
hi .
do you know the difference between a wife and a job ?
what is it ?
after ten years , job still sucks .
that' s a good one , huh ?
i wouldn' t do that if i were you .
that' s not a good idea , no .
oh , mr. marshall , hi .
hey .
i put the story boards on your desk .
picked up your shoes from barney' s .
got your glasses fixed .
there was no charge .
this morning' s staff meeting was canceled .
and i got your cigarettes .
they' re next to your laptop .
this morning' s staff meeting was canceled .
that' s what i was told .
hmm .
good morning , girls .
good afternoon , sire .
hey , anybody know why the staff meeting was canceled ?
nobody called us .
oh , but mr. wanamaker wants to see you as soon as you get in , which i told his office was 15 minutes ago .
i know .
you couldn' t show up on time ?
you know you' re being promoted .
but you look very sharp , by the way .
thank you .
like a creative director .
very distinguished .
you able to handle yourselves on the 44th floor ?
be truthful now .
are you kidding ?
we were made for the 44th floor .
now , get up there already , so we can break out the bubbly .
don' t wait up .
don' t wait up .
he' s so adorable .
he says the cutest things .
boy .
sorry , buddy .
i was in the board meeting that would never end .
have you been here long ?
a couple minutes .
that' s all .
jess , can i get a cup of de caf and a couple tylenol ?
and see if we got any echinacea .
and i need some club soda .
i got something on my tie .
know what ? just get me another tie .
i saw the mock ups you did for johnny walker .
they' re fantastic .
oh , that' s my job , dan .
so , you know i' m not great at making speeches , especially when i haven' t got you to write them for me .
so , i' il do my best .
i' ve been in this racket over 30 years .
let me tell you something , it doesn' t get any easier .
as a matter of fact , it gets harder and harder .
the ' 80s were our glory days .
they were all about alcohol , tobacco and cars .
i felt like i was on top of my game .
and then in the ' 90s , men stopped dominating how dollars were spent , and we lost our compass .
women between 16 and 24 are the fastest growing consumer group .
girls who were born in the mid ' 80s control our advertising dollars .
sorry .
no echinacea .
hi , nick .
hey .
red or lavender ?
red .
no , no , lavender .
that' s good .
lavender' s good .
while we' ve been shooting beer commercials ... with the swedish bikini team , the industry has been transformed .
we were the agency in town ten years ago .
now we' re struggling to be third .
if we don' t evolve and think beyond our natural ability , we' re gonna go down .
think beyond our natural " i' m not quite clear what you mean .
what do you know about darcy mcguire ?
oh , hey , i heard on the whisper she just left b. b. d. & o.
i never met the woman , but i hear she' s a real man eater .
she won that cleo last year we should have won for the add about
oh , yeah , right .
that was her ?
i forgot about that .
yeah , i wish i had .
oh , boy , i hear she is a bitch on wheels .
that' s very funny .
yeah , why ?
' cause i just hired her .
to do what ?
you know i love you , nick , but it' s a woman' s world out there .
getting into a women' s psyche is not exactly your strong suit .
you can get into their pants better than anybody on earth , but their psyche is a whole other ball game .
you hired darcy mcguire to do what ?
i know she hasn' t done it totally on her own yet , but somebody was gonna grab her .
and she' s smart , nick .
she' s very smart .
you made her creative director , didn' t you ?
i' m sorry , buddy .
this isn' t easy , but i got the board breathing down my neck .
she' s coming in this afternoon .
you' il meet her .
come on .
roll with this .
work with her because she' s got what i need to keep this place afloat .
she' s got what you need , meaning she' s a woman .
you know how we can compete with that ?
he' s coming .
he' s coming .
he' s coming .
not so fast , girls .
put it on ice .
we' il break it out soon .
we' re not moving to the 44th floor ?
not today .
oh .
okay , gigi , one more .
gigi , your ex is here .
honey , you look like ... $48 million .
thank you .
may i kiss the bride ?
sure .
nick .
nick !
ted .
congratulations , ted .
you' re a lucky man .
well , thanks .
i happen to agree .
so , you' re going on a cruise .
two weeks , huh ?
well , actually , the cruise is just the last week .
alexandra has an itinerary , and i faxed one ... to your office yesterday , to your apartment last week .
ted' s office has one , as does the school .
in case i' ve fallen off the planet ?
you never know .
hey , here she is .
pretty in pink .
so , two whole weeks together ?
yeah , how you gonna handle it ?
i' m gonna love it .
you can take care of your old man .
cook for me .
get my slippers .
yeah , that' il be happening .
alexandra has a boyfriend now .
mom !
i' m just telling him so he won' t be surprised .
you have a boyfriend ?
you' re only 13 years old .

i thought i was 15 .
we' re gonna be fine .
look , i wanna meet cameron .
okay if i meet dad at his place ?
is it all right ?
yeah , well , i  what time ?
8 : 00 .

hey , i heard .
i can' t believe this .

don' t worry .
we' il get through it .
yeah .
everyone , everyone , meet darcy mcguire .
oh , jeez .
my goodness .
everybody showed up .
darcy , how are you ?
nice to see you .
hi !
pleasant surprise .
god , what a small world .
welcome aboard .
i' m so glad to meet you .
hello .
i' m darcy .
hi .
i' m nick marshall .
oh , i' ve heard a lot about you , nick .
i' ve heard a lot about you too .
don' t worry , can' t all be true .
let' s hope not .
hey .
hey , standing room only .
it' s a first .
i' m very , very excited for you all to meet darcy mcguire .
darcy' s extraordinary reputation ... as a leader in the field precedes her .
at b. b. d. & o. , darcy led a creative team ... that snagged $500 million in new business wins .
and that was just last year alone .
here at sloane curtis , we' ve prided ourselves on our strategic thinking .
now it' s time for us to step up and once again prove ourselves creatively ... in the marketplace .
and i' m thrilled that darcy has consented to move across town , join our team and lead us into the 21st century .
thank you , dan .
and thank you all for that warm welcome .
let me start off by saying the feeling is mutual .
i am absolutely thrilled to be here .
when i first started in this business , it was my dream ... to work at sloane curtis .
i even believe i applied for a job here twice .
somebody call personnel .
but it was b. b. d. & o. that offered me a home .
and what i learned there was that any success i had ... was a direct result of the team of people that i work with .
i know that two heads are better than one .
i know that five heads are better than two .
and i know that if we put our heads and our hearts into this company , we will deliver , i know that .
now , i love challenges .
i love hard work .
i look forward to sitting at this very table tossing ideas around ... until what i fear will be the wee hours of the morning .
i want the work we do to say something about who we are .
how we think , what we feel .
i' m sorry .
excuse me .
so , as our friends in hollywood say , " let' s cut to the chase .
how are we gonna turn this company around ?
when sears decided to go after women in their advertising ... and said , " come see the softer side of sears " , their revenues went up 30 % .
thirty percent .
that' s huge .
female driven advertising totaled $40 billion last year .
and sloane curtis ' share of that was ?
zero .
if you want to sell an anti wrinkle cream ... or a ford mustang to a woman forgive me but this is the last place you bring your business .
and we can' t afford to not have a piece of a $40 billion pie .
so , i have put together a little kit for everybody .
nobody panic .
this is supposed to be fun .
every product in this box is looking for new representation ... right now , and they' re all made for women .
i' m pretty sure all the women here are familiar with most of these products , so for the men let' s just briefly run through them .
here you go , nick .
thank you .
each kit contains anti wrinkle cream , mascara , moisturizing lipstick , bath beads , quick dry nail polish , an at home waxing kit , a more wonderful wonderbra ,
a pregnancy test , hair volumizer , oh , sorry . pore cleansing strips , advil , control top pantyhose and a visa card .
now i want everybody to come up with something for one product , for two , the whole box whatever moves you .
we' il get together tomorrow , have a little show and tell .
how' s 8 : 30 for everybody ?
great .
see you at 8 : 30 tomorrow morning .
a nightmare .
read my lips night mare .
miss , miss , miss !
that' s another 500 bucks .
we play our dangerous game .
a game of chess ... against our old adversary .
adversary " ?
surely you mean adversary , old boy ?
vinaigrette for arugula salad . ... women' s political caucus .
tuck the pelvis under .
lifting .
buns of steel .
i' d steal her buns if i could .
here it comes .
yes , he nailed the dismount !
now let' s check in on the women' s finals .
women' s finals .
there' s way too much estrogen on television these days .
and as we all know , the perfect antidote for estrogen ... [ grunts ]
is frank .
oh , i need some frank .
help me , buddy .
help me now .
don' t panic .
this is supposed to be fun .
okay .
okay , i can do this .
i' m a professional .
lipstick .
all right .
lipstick on a guy' s collar ?
no , no , women will hate that .
lipstick on a guy' s collar that won' t rub off .
no , that' s even worse .
okay , okay , okay , i gotta think like a broad .
all right , i' m a broad .
i see lipstick ... [ sniffs ]
on a dark haired tahitian beauty , standing under a waterfall , wearing nothing but a thong .
water cascading down her back .
i' m a lesbian .
i gotta change the music .
i wonder .
i wonder .
oh , alex , thank you .
ah , jackpot !
oh , she' s hot .

oh , cool .
wow , mascara .
here we go .
nice , thick lashes .
ow !
ow !
shit , that stings !
what the fu
okay , fine .
well , i need some anesthetic here .
beautiful .
okay .
now ... for the piece de resistance , we have
we have the right leg .
yes , excellent .
and the hot , hot wax .
very hot wax .
here we go .
jeez !
ooh , that' s hot .
okay , test of manhood .
here we go .
okay , we passed .
and next ... we immediately apply disposable cloth ... over the waxed ... area .
straight ahead .
yes .
yeah ... it feels kinda nice , yeah .
i don' t know why women complain about waxing their legs .
in one smooth motion , yank the strip quickly ... in the opposite direction of the hair growth .
no , no , that would be north .
one , two , three .
women are insane .
who would do that more than once ?
i don' t know .
why would anybody even do the other leg ?
ah , yes , that' s right , girls .
wax it off and cover it up .
yeah .
ally oop !
ooh , wait .
oh , shit !
i guess this takes a little finesse .
one down , two to go .
okay .
okay .
okay .
oh .
honey , you just lost yourself five pounds .
all right , where' s my wonderbra ?
oh .
let' s see which end is up here .

you sound like the guy from shine .
what' s wrong with you ?
i don' t need a doctor .
maybe i need , like , an exorcist .
under " e " for exorcist .
there are no exorcists in the greater chicago area .
let' s pull it together here and go sell some sensitive feminine shit , okay ?
sorry to interrupt .
here you go .
by the way , your hair looks really good today , mr. marshall .
and it' s okay you pay me minimum wage ... because i just use the company phone to call my boyfriend in israel ... for an hour .
tell me you heard that .
your hair looks really good .
so what ?
the the other thing !
what she was thinking thing .
i don' t think she thinks too much .
she' s not exactly a genius .
i' il have you know she went to an ivy league school .
doubt that .
the thing about the boyfriend , calling him in israel , you heard that , yes , no ?
i didn' t hear it ' cause she didn' t say it .
now let' s pull it together .
we' re gonna be late for our sorority meeting .
morgan , in case i , like , maybe die today
can we walk and talk ?
' cause in case you live , i don' t wanna be late .
here' s what happened , just in case the coroner asks .
i got a little drunk last night , and i tried on all the products from the pink box .
you did not .
i put on all the products nail polish , panty hose , everything .
you tried on the panty hose ?
yes , okay .
anyway , i was drying my hair , and i fell over and tripped , fell into the bathtub and electrocuted myself .
i blacked out , and when i woke up ...
i could hear what every woman around me was ... thinking .
uh huh .
i' m talking personal , private stuff .
the stuff that nobody is supposed to hear , i hear that stuff .
you know what i' m saying ?
i can hear what women think .
can you ?
good , ' cause that' s not a talent guys have these days .
you don' t believe me .
you want me to prove it ?
see this attorney coming toward us ?
yeah .
oh , she thinks you' re overpaid and gay .
what ?
i hear what they' re all thinking .
it' s driving me crazy .
even french poodles , i can hear them .
so we' re on the same page , i need you to know you sound insane .
you freaked out over losing the job , which i understand .
but if you tell anybody else you can hear the innermost thoughts of a french poodle
what if i just jumped out the window ?
jumped through the plate glass .
would they notice ?
probably not if i didn' t get glass on anybody .
that girl with the fruit is funny .
suicidal , but she is funny .
nick , what girl with the fruit ?
the  huh ?
last one to arrive .
wants me to know i' m not his boss .
okay , you' re a star .
i get the message .
she thinks i' m late because i want her to know she' s not my boss .
what is she talking about ?
put a lid on it .
i' m begging you .
ooh , i can' t believe i have butterflies in my stomach .
feels like the first day of school .
okay , so let' s see how we did .
nobody wants to go first .
everyone' s avoiding me , except nick marshall .
unbelievable .
the only one with good eye contact .
at least he' s looking at my eyes and not down my blouse .
so nick , what did you come up with ?
me ?
what did i come up with ?
he' s so wired .
mostly ... [ clears throat ]
i thought about the moisturizing lipstick , never having worn lipstick myself .
i tried to imagine what i' d want from a lipstick , if i were a woman .
oh , spare me .
okay , he' s trying to be honest .
you know , to be perfectly honest , the thirst thing i thought was a tahitian beauty , bathing under a waterfall .
oy , i' m gonna die here with these kinds of ideas .
but , uh , you know , i' m working on it , and it' s evolving .
i don' t suppose anybody' s interested in an idea involving the swedish bikini team ?
i do know them all personally .
oh , what an idiot .
jerk , grow up already .
what a pig .
you are so foul .
i should have asked for more money .
excuse me .
gina ?
i spent the night trying to figure out how to sell advil just to women .
you know what ?
you should sell it to women like me .
i take it every time i need to fake a headache .
works like a charm .
i i got a great one .
it just came to me .
do you mind if i interrupt , dina ?
no , sure , go ahead .
i hate that you' ve seen me naked .
all right .
so , we' re in a bedroom , the lights are out .
there' s a woman in bed , and she' s taking an advil .
her husband turns over and suggestively rubs her back , and we say , " advil .
so mild and gentle , you can take it ... even when you' re faking a headache .
woman turns to her husband and says , " oh not tonight dear , i need an advil .
he' s back .
what ?
come on .
that doesn' t reach women on a personal level ?
no .
women do that , don' t they ?
i don' t .
no ?
sue cranston , you' ve done that , haven' t you ?
faked a headache to
no , nick , i haven' t .
thanks for asking .
no , wait , wait , wait .
be honest now .
i mean , you' ve been married what , ten , twelve years ?
you' ve never faked a headache ?
it doesn' t work like a charm ?
no , nick , i haven' t .
i mean , no , it doesn' t , okay ?
jeez .
what an asshole !
okay , i guess i' m way off base here .
what' s good about your idea is that you' re looking at advil from a woman' s point of view .
um , i don' t think advil will go for it , and i' m pretty sure every woman in america will hate it .
other than that , i thought it was great .
you' re on the right track .
hang in there .
go ahead .
great antenna there , babe .
the poodle give you that one ?
what are you doing home early ?
i have my first migraine .
this is hideous .
my boyfriend feeling me up in front of my father .
don' t think anything .
the outlook wasn' t good for the mudville nine .
the score was four to two .
oh , shit .
where' s my bra ?
where is it ?
oh , god .
oh , god !
okay , look .
everybody just needs to chill out here .
there' il be no chilling .
just get your stuff ... and move on .
come on , man .
relax .
how old are you ?
i just turned 18 .
well , she' s 15 .
she was 10 five years ago .
you know what i' m saying , stud ?
now get out .
dad !
we' re going to the prom .
don' t ruin it .
you' re not going to the prom with this punk .
how did you know about prom ?
look , i don' t know .
mom told me , all right ?
but it' s not gonna happen because he' s too old for you .
i know what boys his age want , and he' s not getting it from my daughter .
door .
your daughter ?
suddenly , i' m your daughter .
how am i related to this asshole ?
another one .
i want mom .
hey , look , i' m just gonna take off .
i' m real sorry about this .
save it .
that' s mine .
where where are you [ sighs ]
great day .
okay , i' m not losing my mind .
i' m already losing my mind .
this will work .
it' s gotta work .
this has gotta work .
shit .
perfect .
come on !
do your thing !
turn me into me again !
oh , good , i' m not dead .
oh , please !
please , please , please .
tell me i got rid of it .
please be a woman .
please .
for what city , please ?
you couldn' t possibly do me a favor ... and think of your favorite color or tv program , could you ?
for what city , please ?
flo ?
hey , flo !
flo ?
i can' t believe this .
i need a woman .
try this one .
oh , i love this .
this is fantastic .
oh , it' s my mother' s birthday next week , so i need two gift sets .
you' ve been a great help .
i appreciate it .
do you have a kleenex back there so i can wipe that off ?
i' m sure she' il like it .
it' s one of our best sellers .
do i get a free gift with this ?
yes , you get a travel bag .
thank you .
stop it .
you' ve got the dress .
treat yourself to lipstick .
no , i have enough at home .
you might as well get one , right ?
i have too many lipsticks .
i have piles of them .
i don' t need it .
i' il buy it for you .
if he doesn' t answer that phone in the next two rings ,
i swear to god !
hi , blue eyes .
dr. , you may not remember me .
yes ?
i' m nick marshall .
i came here about ten years ago with my ex wife , gigi .
oh , christ , not him .
oh , good , you remember me .
i' m sorry to barge in like this , but i don' t know who to turn to .
i' m afraid to go to work .
i' m afraid of my door woman .
i' m i' m afraid to get a cup of coffee .
mr. marshall , please slow down .
slow down .
let me make sure i completely understand what it is you' re saying .
all right .
all right .
i hear what women think .
yeah .
you know , mr. marshall , this kind of imaginary displacement scenario ...
i' m not imag  really isn' t my thing .
i do , however , have a very good friend over at university hospital , who specializes in male menopause and testosterone depletion .
she' s fabulous .
i think what i' il do is just give her a ring ... and send you over there .
why did i answer my door ?
i was so into buying that lamp on ebay .
how much was it going for ?
how much was what going for ?
the lamp on ebay .
oh , i see .
that' s good .
very clever .
dr. skolnick , please .
all right , you don' t believe me .
well then , try another one .
go on .
pick a number .
give it a whirl .
any number .
okay .
a number between one and
a million .
why not ?
one and a million .
all right .
mm .
644, 998 99 90 .
wanna make a decision here ?
oy vay !
oh , you can say that again .
i didn' t say anything .
i know , but that does not mean i that didn' t hear it .
okay .
okay .
let' s say let' s say i do believe you .
yeah .
that you you can hear what women think .
even though i' m a grown woman of ... [ thinking ]
51 .
47 .
oh , my lips are sealed .
holy crap !
oh , forgive me .
that' s all right .
but this is phenomenal .
you can hear inside my head .
yes .
why would you want to get rid of such a brilliant gift ?
well , for starters , almost every woman i know thinks i' m an asshole .
what i thought when i first met you .
doc , give me a break here .
mr. marshall , you might find this a little unorthodox , but would you mind awfully if i smoked ?
no , no , i understand .
thank you .
thank you so much .
let' s try to look at the up side of this , shall we ?
you know , freud died at age 83 still asking one question ,
what do women want ?
wouldn' t it be strange and wonderful if you were the one man on earth ... finally able to answer that question ?
listen to me , nick .
something extraordinary ... and i think miraculous has happened to you .
my advice is you must learn from this .
you know , there isn' t a single woman that i treat ... that doesn' t wish her man understood her better .
if men are from mars and women are from venus and you speak venusian , the world can be yours .
i don' t know how this happened to you or why , but you may just be the luckiest man on earth .
imagine the possibilities .
if you know what women want , you can rule .
hubba hubba , here he comes , looking awfully good today .
and i haven' t had sex in four months .
okay , six .
why did i tell him to stop asking me out ?
i' m an idiot !
idiot !
idiot !
hey , nick , how' s it going ?
lola , my love .
i can' t take no for an answer .
about what ?
about what ?
about us .
just don' t hurt me , nick .
i' ve been hurt too many times .
i know how hard it is to go out with someone new .
i mean , there' s always that fear of , well , getting hurt .
at least that' s how i feel inside .
you do , really ?
all the time .
me , too , all the time .
so , let' s just take it slow and see how it goes .
slow is good .
slow is really good .
yeah .
are you free tonight ?
so , you don' t think i' m gay ?
you' re saying you never said that ?
right , i never said that .
but that doesn' t mean you didn' t think it .
is it the hair ?
the highlights happen to be natural .
morgan , i have a meeting .
and you don' t think i' m overpaid either , right ?
you never said that .
i don' t think i ever said that .
okay .
who has he been talking to ?
morning .
morning .
well , then check your e mail .
i sent it over
hi , annie .
how' s the boyfriend in israel ?
oh , by the way , i want to thank you for picking up that wine .
that' s above and beyond .
i appreciate it so much .
thank you .
uh , can i get you a cup of coffee or , um , some water or any kind of beverage ?
no , but thank you .
if i' m thirsty , i know where the coffee room is .
that' s right , guys , don' t help .
just walk right past me .
why don' t you step on my hands , you big
here you go .
how you doing ?
oh .
oh , fine .
thank you , mr. marshall .
you' re welcome , um  erin .
erin .
you be careful , all right , erin ?
yeah , sure .
heavy .
what do you know ?
there is life on this planet .
breakfast tuesday sounds great .
absolutely .
thanks for the info .
and thanks for the champagne .
you too .
okay , bye bye .
set meeting , nike , women' s division .
hi .
hi .
well , you' ve been here five minutes .
looks like you' ve been here a year .
oh , yeah .
i' m compulsive .
it' s a problem .
why do i always feel like he' s checking me out ?
i wonder what he' s got up his sleeve .
great photographs .
no clue they' re all margaret bourke white .
they' re not all margaret bourke white , are they ?
yeah , they are .
wow .
it' s a beautiful collection .
thanks .
so how' s it going ?
mmm .
you know , i was gonna ask you the same thing .
it' s starting slow .
i' m evaluating staff , that' s hard .
oh , yeah .
yeah , right .
well , you know , i don' t wanna beat around the bush .
what i' d like to propose  he' s proposing so soon ?
oh , sorry .
sorry .
oh !
uh , yes  excuse me .
you got another one .
wow !
thanks .
as i was saying ,
i know nothing whatsoever about the products you' re going for personally , but i do believe i can sell anything ... once i know what the buyer' s needs are .
and what i' d really like , with your kind indulgence of course , is to go after that really big fish .
i mean , the one you really wanna land .
i' il learn what i need to know , and i' il reel them in for us .
no , actually , i think i' il reel them in for us .
that is , unless you' re going after something in particular yourself .
no .
it' s just that there' re several big fish out there at the moment .
oh , yeah ?
well , what' s your biggest fish ?
to your mind , who' s your whale ?
um , nike women' s division ?
you heard they were shopping ?
i got wind of it .
amazing .
i heard no one knew .
you knew .
i heard no one else knew .
it' s okay if i know what you know .
we' re on the same team .
besides , yeah .
i heard someone say once two heads are better than one
oh , you were listening .
more than you know .
okay , here' s what i heard .
nike is shopping , quietly .
but if they make a change , it' s gonna happen fast .
now , you know this is a tough one for us to get .
it would be a tough one for anybody to get , but if we got it
that' s all we' d need .
i hear you .
so , what do they want exactly ?
they wanna empower women .
what ?
i' m sorry .
that won' t work .
no , okay .
i' m sorry .
i understand .
go on .
listen , they wanna get inside women' s heads ... and reach them on a very real level .
now don' t take this the wrong way , but yesterday you got jumpy talking about lipstick .
i know .
nike is state of the art hard core woman power .
you sure you wanna go after this one ?
you get ' em here in two weeks , i' il be ready .
this guy is kind of exciting .
hey !
glad i caught you both .
you got a minute ?
sure .
i want you to look at these boards for u. s. air before they come by .
right .
it feels like something' s missing .
hmm .
i don' t like the graphics .
feels a bit parochial .
maybe it should be in black and white .
what do you think , nick ?
i don' t know who you' ve had , but , i don' t know , it seems kind of
what' s the word ?
parochial to me .
um , what do you think , darcy ?
i totally agree , especially about the graphics .
they' re parochial .
it' s so funny you just said that .
yeah ?
why don' t you get them to try it in black and white ?
might punch it up a little .
what ?
did you say something ?
no .
i just swear i was thinking the exact same thing .
were you ?
black and white could really help .
good idea , nick .
good idea , nick ?
speak up .
quick .
say something before he leaves .
uh , dan ?
want me to take another look at the boards ?
once they have another stab at it , give me a buzz .
i will .
thanks , buddy .
dan ?
in case they find nick' s idea too retro , which they might
oh , yeah . they may think it' s old fashioned
i' d be ready with some maybe a dot com kind of thing ?
maybe there' s something about getting on line and being on line at the airport .
no , i think we' re fine , really .
really , we' re good .
i like nick' s fix on this .
great .
hey , you wanna come by later ?
i got a box of new cubans , just came in .
great .
cool .
you smoke cigars ?
no .
you know , your office is looking really snazzy .
i love the red .
thanks .
mr. marshall , your daughter' s on line one .
oh .
i' m sorry .
would you mind  oh .
here you go .
he has a daughter ?
didn' t picture that .
how old ?
she' s 15 .
she' s staying with me while her mom' s away .
he' s married ?
away on her honeymoon .
oh .
alex , hi .
uh huh .
oh , sure , honey .
no , that' s great .
honey " ?
who are you trying to impress ?
okay , look , i' m gonna go out with my friends after school .
then can i bring them back to your place , or will you freak out again ?
no , no , no , no .

whatever you want .
what time are you gonna be home ?

total shocker .
he' s like a nice guy .
sorry , duty calls .
oh , of course .
she' s 15 ?
yeah .
got a boyfriend that' s 18 .
and you hate that , right ?
hate it .
yeah .
but she digs him , and he' s invited her to the prom .
that' s a big deal , i guess .
going to the prom is mostly about the dress .
you know that , right ?
oh , yeah .
is it ?
once you got the dress handled , it' s all downhill from there .
this feels like a date .
why did i go into all that ?
he needs to go .
well , i' m out of here .
do some research downtown , get inside women' s heads .
well , if you need any help  i' il be picking your brain .
you got it .
i' il take it .
oh , god .
candy .
she won' t last a month .
oh , i like that one , but it says you can' t wear it if you have hips .
that one' s cute .
it' s low cut .
i can' t wear low cut .
alex ?
it' s open .

uh , hi .

but i' il be home early .
hey , why don' t you guys order a pizza ?
there' s not a scrap of food in the joint .
i also wanted to know if maybe you and i could go out on a date soon ?
i' d like to take you shopping for a prom dress .
oh , that is so sweet .
i wish my dad would do something like that .
i love him .
i don' t get it .
first , you throw cameron out .
now you wanna take me shopping so i can go to the prom with him ?
i overreacted , and i just wanna make up for it by taking you shopping .
i mean , it' s a pretty important thing , you know ?
they say it' s all downhill after the dress .
he must be stoned .
fine .
i' il get the most expensive dress , shoes , makeup .
he can afford it .

oh , well and so understanding and
hey .

i can' t believe i asked him up .

if i sleep with him , he' il think i' m a slut and never call me again .
or he' il call me all the time ' cause he' il think he can get it whenever he wants .
oh , what' s the difference ?
he' s so incredible !
he reminds me of my sister .
so , what do you think ?
well , i
i' il only come up if you really want me to .
i don' t want you to do anything that you' re not ready for .
i can wait .
oh , he' s got a great body .

okay , you know why guys like doing it in front of the mirror ?
why ?
objects may appear larger .
that' s a good one .
anyway .
oh , that' s a good one .
i heard that in the beauty shop this morning .
but seriously .
dee ?
huh ?
that other thing we were talking about before .
come on .
i mean , he can' t just ignore you all night , stay glued to the tv like some zombie ... and then expect you to turn it on like a lightbulb .
i mean , i wouldn' t put up with that .
i mean , you' re either interesting or you' re not .
ask him to decide .
can i write that down ?
all right .
i' m either interesting or i' m not .
he' il shit a brick .
hmm .
what if he says i' m not ?
he won' t say that you' re not .
trust me .
okay , i did it .
i told chaim i wasn' t moving to israel .
yeah , good .
and ?
i said what you said .
he can be a writer anywhere .
if i' m going to be in advertising , i need to be here and not there .
and then he said ?
i don' t know .
it was in hebrew .
ooh .
but i don' t think it was , " you got it .
see you next tuesday .
i don' t know .
i' d wait it out .
he' il call you .
i can' t .
i better call him back .
be strong .
he will call you .
well , girls , been nice chattin ' .
i gotta get back to work .
can i make you a sandwich ?
no , i' m cool .
really .
but thank you , anyway .
this was fun .
aww !
huh .
this is good .
more insightful than i would' ve thought .
this line doesn' t feel exactly right .
if you' re thinking that line isn' t perfect , i agree .
it needs work .
there' s something not exactly right about it , isn' t there ?
i mean , it' s not bad .
it' s insightful , actually .
it' s just
well , what do you think this woman' s thinking ?
uh , well , i
let' s see .
uh , she' s thinking about what she wants out of life .
what' s she gonna accomplish ?
how' s she gonna do all that ?
women , you know , they think about that a lot .
i mean , surprisingly a lot .
they worry all the time about everything .
you' re so right .
how do you know that ?
well , you know , even i had a mother .
well
so maybe running gives her time off from all of that .
maybe , it gives her something she can' t get anyplace else .
look at her .
god .
i want to be her .
she looks so free , doesn' t she ?
no one' s judging her , no boss to worry about , no guys to worry about , no games to figure her way through .
i like that .
no games .
that' s good .
that' d be nice in life , wouldn' t it ?
okay , can i just think for one second ?
take your time .
okay .
okay .
no games .
how do i get that in ?
she' s running .
it' s early , it' s quiet .
just the sound of her feet on the asphalt .
she likes to run alone .
no pressure , no stress .
this is the one place she can be herself .
look any way she wants , dress any way she wants , think any way she wants .
no game playing , no rules .
games , sports , rules .
games , sports , rules .
playing by the rules .
playing games versus playing
playing by the rules .
playing games versus playing
why are you nodding ?
because i think you' re onto something .
am i ?
aren' t you ?
well , i was thinking about a play on words .
something about games versus
i feel like i was onto something good .
playing games versus playing  sports ?
yes !
thank you .
do you like any of this ?
a lot .
i like the idea that you can be yourself on the road .
i do too .
did i say that out loud ?
no , i was just
' cause i was circling around the exact same thing ,
which is great , we' re on the same  yeah .
sorry , i' m not thinking straight .
my glands may be swollen .
maybe they should be more swollen .

sorry .
i' m sorry .
no , that' s all right .
no , that' s okay .
you must have looked so forward to meeting me .
i was dreading it .
i had this whole other person built up in my mind .
well , since we' re sharing , i heard a few things about you too .
yes , i' m sure .
i' m the " man eating bitch darth vader " of the ad world .
verbatim .
really ?
all right .
well , nice to meet you .
that' s not who i am at all .
just for the record , i don' t think that' s who you are .
i don' t .

what' s going on ?
well , i have an early meeting tomorrow with dan , and i wanted to make it later in the week so that i could be more prepared .
but then i' ve heard that you slipped in there and took the only time he had left , which left me with 8 : 15 tomorrow morning .
it' s fine .
i' m just not as ready as i wish i was .
sorry .
you didn' t do it on purpose .
i just don' t want him to be disappointed .
hey , why don' t we go through some of these together ?
really ?
i insist .
unless you' re too tired or something .
oh , no .
i' m not tired .
yeah , i can see that .
it' s just so far beyond tired at this point .
i' ve basically stopped sleeping ever since i took this job .
you have ?
yeah , it' s weird .
i , um [ thinking ]
how do i say this ?
you don' t feel quite like yourself here , do you ?
no , i don' t .
not yet , anyway .
boy .
plus , i' m mad that i' m getting sick .
i never , ever get sick .
in fact , you don' t have to sit so close to me if you don' t want to .
no , come here .
i' il brave it .
so , where do we kick off ?
control top panty hose ?
okay .
personally , i think they do the trick .
you' ve worn control top panty hose ?
did you put a pair in the box ?
seriously ?
oh , yeah .
you are full of surprises .
yeah .
no , no , no .
i mean that as a compliment .
i love that .
and how did you look in them ?
ooh .
hot .
my daughter and her boyfriend walked in , and i got ' em on with
and they said what when they saw you in your panty hose ?
it was the turquoise wonderbra they noticed .
then , the nail polish .
the dress you picked out is totally hideous .
i' m not coming out .
it can' t be that bad .
come on out .
i look like a nun an ugly nun .
why ?
because it' s gray ?
gray is the new black .
if he says he likes it , i' il die .
okay , next .
this , i love .
thank you .
next .
i think this is the one .
i like that no , i love that .
okay , this is it .
let me take a look .
yes !
i look older .
this is great .
oh , god , i need boobs .
oh , i' il buy a padded bra when he' s not around .
oh , i can' t believe this is what i' il be wearing the last night i' m a virgin .
or should i say , what i' il be taking off .
alex ?
hmm ?
i wanna talk to you about something that' s pretty important .
i' ve never talked to you about  oh , god .
he' s actually gonna try to be a dad .
this should be hilarious .
i realize i haven' t been the perfect dad .
understatement of the century .
can you pass the bread ?
yeah , sure , sure .
but that does not mean i don' t have the right ... to talk to you about about
about ?
all right .
you' re a young woman now , and you may be flirting with the idea of of
having sex ?
um , can i get a lemonade , please ?
well , you know , boys and girls think very differently about sex .
my hunch is girls just want guys to like ' em and hang out with ' em .
whereas guys and not all guys , alright ?
but most guys , they pretty much just wanna have sex .
okay , i' m what i' m trying to say here is ,
i don' t want you to feel pressured ...
because your boyfriend' s older .
please .
save it .
mom had this talk with me when i was , like , 11 .
i know you' re supposed to have sex when you' re in love and when it' s special .
i know everything .
and mom knows me for real and knows my friends and knows cameron , so let' s leave the parental talks up to her , okay ?
plus i promised cameron i' d do it .
oh , jeez .
and also , let' s not make me part of this nick makeover ... or whatever this new thing you' re into is , okay ?
what new thing ?
what new thing ?
this ridiculous new guy you' re trying to be .
clowning around with me all the sudden ?
asking if we can make a salad together ?
watch friends together ?
i mean , it' s nuts after 15 years of no relating .
i mean , come on .
who are you to talk about relationships anyway ?
you never had a real relationship with anyone in your entire life .
look , i' m supposed to meet my friends .
so i' m gonna go , okay ?
sure .
thanks for the dress .
she didn' t even finish her lunch .
johnny come lately , giving her advice ?
oh , teenagers .
i think the talk worked .
she' s totally right .
move on , dude .
it' s over .
please .
now you' ve seen how the cake is assembled .
the next time you admire a wedding cake , you' il be able to appreciate
wow .
it looks so gorgeous .
fit , vibrant hair .
oh .
i hated being overweight .
i always wanted to be thin and pretty ... and wear cute little clothes .
it built and it built , and my health deteriorated .
and i couldn' t walk and i couldn' t stand ... to even stand up at the park for ten minutes while my kids played .
i tried sitting on the swings , and the chains cut my hips and it hurt .
and i couldn' t i couldn' t run and i couldn' t move .
and i was tired and i wanted to be a good mom .
what the hell' s wrong with me ?
hello ?
what am i doing ?
darcy ?
how did you know it was me ?
i didn' t say anything .
i , uh , just sensed it .
shit .
i' m such an idiot .
i didn' t think he' d be there .
excuse me ?
i didn' t mean to really call you .
i had your number here , and i was thinking of you .
thinking of calling you .
obviously , i did call you .
oh , no , that' s all right .
i , uh
i was thinking about you too .
well , here' s to another great idea .
what , " let' s meet for a drink " ?
yes .
yeah ?
that' s exactly what i wanted to say .
sometimes i think you' re a bit of a mind reader .
but i don' t have to be a mind reader with you .
hmm .
you always say what you think .
i know .
it' s a curse .
what
are you kidding ?
it' s a relief an enormous relief .
do you know how rare that is , to actually say what you think ?
do you have any idea how rare it is for someone to actually like that about me ?
trust me , this has not been a great thing in my life .
my ex husband didn' t love me .
let' s just put it that way .
he didn' t love you ?
did i just say that ?
oh , god !
um , i meant to say " it .
he didn' t love it that i spoke my mind .
if you wanna know the truth , i' m not sure he did really love me .
ooh .
there' s a conversation starter .
god .
a smart person would just get so very drunk now .
how long were you married ?
a little less than a year .
i' ve been divorced about nine months now .
we worked together .
you know that , right ?
oh , yeah .
i knew that .
i heard it .
hmm .
what was that like ?
it was great in the beginning .
but it changed .
it became competitive .
suddenly , the better i did , the worse we did .
the price i pay for being me .
i know that now .
no , truly .
oh .
no , no , it' s true .
do you wanna know all this about me ?
keep going .
well , that' s why i needed to get out there on my own , as scary as it was .
i mean , not scary , but , um
well , yeah , i was kind of scared .
why ?
i don' t know .
i guess i wasn' t sure i could do the job .
i mean , i thought i could do it , but i' m finding sloane curtis a much tougher place to navigate than i thought .
i' m sorry .
i know you were up for my job .
no .
i' m sorry i' m the one that got it .
i' m i' m not .
i' m not .
i' ve learned a lot from you .
like what ?
like what ?
for starters , you really love what you do .
you really love what you do .
not as much as you do .
how can you say that ?
you' re so great at it .
you' re so great at it .
i think dan' s even wondering why he hired me .
really .
i think the bloom is definitely off the rose .
you wanna hear something really great ?
yeah .
i just closed escrow on my first apartment ever .
finally , i own my own place .
what ?
i wish i was a mind reader .
no .
i was just thinking ...
how men like me can get so screwed up .
i don' t think there are men like you .
if we kissed , would it ruin everything ?
listen to me .
i think ... you are one of the great women .
i really do .
i' m sorry .
but i just meant to say thank you .
i' m so sorry .
well , i , uh , guess i' il see you ... in , let' s see , three and a half hours .
nick , may i just say ... you are an exceptionally great kisser .
no , i mean really , really great .
well , i haven' t had this much fun making out since
i' ve never had this much fun making out .
me either .
don' t let this get weird at work ?
no .
we have nothing to be embarrassed about .
we made out .
you and i made out .
and if i may , it was  sexy as hell .
god .
that' s just what i was about to say .
but i think i said it first , i think .
oh , no , you did .
oh .
um , well , all right , then .
oh , i' m a grown woman .
just say it .
do you want to come back to my place ?
say it !
do you want to come
good night , darcy .
good night .
good night .
what am i doing ?
lola .
it' s okay .
okay .
here he comes .
lola ?
i know i haven' t heard from you .
lola , how long have you been out here ?
just a few ... hours .
nick , you said that you wouldn' t hurt me .
and then you slept with me , and then you didn' t call me for six days .
so that , in the world of me , that' s torture .
i mean , we have this totally unbelievable , life altering sex , and then you just disappear .
i mean , you you you stopped drinking coffee !
lola , i' m so sorry .
it' s okay .
it' s okay , because i figured out your little secret .
you did ?
it' s so obvious .
how else would you know the things that you know ?
it wasn' t obvious to anybody else .
nick , come on .
you' re so sensitive .
you' re so aware of my feelings .
you' re so tuned in .
you talk to me like a woman , you think like a woman .
nick !
come on !
admit it .
you' re totally and completely gay .
i am ?
you' re not ?
oh !
i mean , if you' re not , you gotta tell me .
based on the other night just put me out of my misery .
are you or aren' t you ?
say you' re gay .
then i' m not nuts .
i' m not undesirable .
not rejected by another guy !
say it !
say you' re gay !
admit it !
okay .
i' m gay .
how gay ?
oh !
i' m as gay as it gets .
you' re gonna make some guy very happy someday .
oh , from your lips .
god , i hate that i' m crying .
well , look it .
if things should ever change in that department
you' il be the first to know .
you promise ?
oh , yeah , i promise .
come here .
oh , boy .
it was very nice meeting you , nick .
and you .
thanks for pep talk , yes ?
you two just take care of each other .
and thanks for the yarmulke .
oh , no problem .
you wear it well , yes ?
happy trails , kids .
isn' t he great ?
darcy !
i need to talk to you .
uh oh , look at him .
i knew it .
he is weird about it .
this is not about last night .
it' s about the nike meeting .
and i honestly believe in my gut ...
that you should make the pitch .
oh , god .
i guilted you into this last night .
no , no .
it would be better if you did it .
no , no , no .
this is your baby .
you' ve gotta do it .
i gotta go meet and greet these folks .
i' il see you in there .
it' s not my baby .
yes , it is .
i predict no one will even know i' m gone until the files start to build .
it could be days .
and then someone will finally ask ,
where' s the geek in the glasses who carries all the files ?
do either of you two know what the story is on this erin girl ?
miss lonely hearts ?
who knows ?
yeah .
ooh , i know .
she' s been here two years .
she tried to be a copywriter but got turned down .
so she got stuck as a messenger .
what fool turned her down ?
you did , sire .
well , did i ever meet with her at least ?
i don' t think so .
as i recall , you told me to " blow her off .
well , i wanna meet with her now .
the kid' s got something .
she' s kind of funny .
this is your lucky day , pal .
i just saw the nike group get off the elevator .
all women .
your specialty .
come on .
i' il walk you up .
i hate what i' m doing to darcy .
i hate it !
i' m gonna write her a long letter , confess everything .
you' re doing darcy ?
since when ?
no !
i said i hate what i' m doing to darcy .
men are stupider .
it' s true .
will you stop it ?
they are .
" they " ?
are you officially a woman now ?
oh , i wish .
a woman wouldn' t have screwed over the woman she loved .
no , they don' t think that way .
and another thing .
this thing about penis envy .
yeah .
not true .
no .
they don' t envy it .
half of' em don' t even like it .
you know who has penis envy ?
we do .
that' s why we cheat and screw up and lie , because we' re all obsessed with our own equipment .
you ready ?
okay .
yeah .
thanks .
you don' t stand in front of a mirror before a run ... and wonder what the road will think of your outfit .
you don' t have to listen to its jokes and pretend they' re funny .
it would not be easier to run if you dressed sexier .
the road doesn' t notice if you' re not wearing lipstick .
it does not care how old you are .
you do not feel uncomfortable ... because you make more money than the road .
and you can call on the road whenever you feel like it , whether it' s been a day ... or even a couple of hours since your last date .
the only thing the road cares about ... is that you pay it a visit once in a while .
nike .
no games .
just sports .
he nailed it .
they hit a home run .
where do we sign ?
why are you not the happiest guy in chicago right now ?
you just did so great .
no , no , i didn' t do so great .
we did so
no , actually , you did so great .
you .
you , me .
we did great !
will you come with me someplace ?
i wanna show you something .
no , i have something i really need to finish .
please ?
please .
okay .
here you go .
come with me .
all right .
should i close my eyes or anything ?
no .
so , you see those top two floors right there ?
i do .
all mine .
wow .
come here .
so this is my
living room .
it' s beautiful .
what are you thinking ?
you' ve got that look you have sometimes .
yeah ?
no .
i was just wondering when you get to move in .
well , they said two weeks , so
okay .
this is the dining room .
the fireplace works .
come here .
wow .
i can see elegant parties in here .
waiters with caviar ,
you in a beautiful gown .
you can see all that ?
maybe you' re naked and i' m the only guest , but it' d still be elegant .
okay .
so this is upstairs .
there' s a second bedroom or a future office or whatever .
and this is my boudoir .
your boudoir comes with pretty decent music .
it does .
where is that coming from ?
let' s turn up the volume .
so , where' s your bed going ?
uh , right ... here .
so , if you had a bed , we' d be dancing on it .
i like it here .
i like it here too .
no .
i mean , i like it here .
oh .
believe me , we' re as excited as you are .
dan ?
i gotta talk to you .
yeah ?
he' il be there .
bye .
i gotta talk to you too .
that was nike .
they' re gonna announce to the trades that we won the account .
i gotta hand it to you .
you saved my ass .
you saved the company' s ass .
actually , dan , i had very little to do with saving anybody' s ass .
it' s darcy you should be thanking , that' s what i want to talk about .
darcy ?
please .
i was there yesterday .
the girl didn' t open her mouth .
look , i' m a big enough man to admit when i screw up .
i looked at the marketplace and i panicked .
nick , forgive me .
i want you to step in here .
no , no , no , no .
dan , you did the right thing when you hired her .
i mean , she is the best creative director i have ever seen , bar none .
this isn' t about she' s adorable .
oh , yeah , she is .
but this isn' t about that ?
no , no .
not like that .
no , no .
please .
look .
i' ve been doing a lot of listening lately .
and i' ve decided ...
i need to take a leave of absence .
i need to get away from here and get some perspective on things .
what are you , nuts ?
what is this ?
what do you mean ?
this is the biggest account this company has ever landed .
do you want me to have nobody running the shop ?
what are you talking about ?
darcy' s here .
for somebody who listens a lot , you don' t hear so well .
i had a meeting with her today .
i sat her down .
we had a talk .
oh , dan !
you didn' t .
tell me you didn' t fire her .
she didn' t even put up a fight .
oh , dan , no !
hey , she' s gone , pal .
no , no .
it' s not too late .
look , call her .
tell her you need her back , you made a mistake .
hire her back .
hey , calm down .
i can' t do that .
why ?
because i talked to the board and i told them i don' t need her anymore .
oh !
they offered her a settlement .
besides , nike says they want you .
you' re what they bought .
i got a delivery can i
would you come out for one second ?
let me tell you something .
my job is to deliver you .
dan , nike bought an idea .
it wasn' t even mine .
every good idea that they loved yesterday came from her .
and if you don' t get darcy mcguire back in here , and i mean pronto , the board is gonna be paying you your settlement .
this is all about saving your ass , right ?
save it .
annie , get a hold of darcy' s address and number as quick as possible .
yeah , sure .
where' s the girl in glasses ?
erin ?
i don' t think she' s in today .
did she call in sick ?
i don' t think so .
didn' t show up .
oh , where does she live ?
does anyone know where erin lives ?
who' s erin ?
and then someone will finally ask ,
where' s the geek in the glasses who carries all the files ?
hey .
yeah .
did you get a hold of darcy ?
no ?
keep trying .
and when you get a hold of her , tell her to stay put .
i' m coming right over .
i just have to make a little stop on the way .
do you know where this is ?
down the alley .
just down the alley .
thanks .
come on , erin .
be there .
please  [ cat meows ]
erin ?
hello ?
no , no .
dear mom [ continues , indistinct ]
mr. marshall !
mr. marshall ?
yes , erin .
yes , it' s me .

i really did not mean to scare you .
okay ?
i just wanted to come and see how you are .
how are you ?
mr. marshall , if you' re here because i didn' t show up today , i' m sorry .
i was just about to call .
i swear .
no , i' m not here because you didn' t show up for work .
but i' m here well , i
i bet you' re wondering why i am here , huh ?
as a matter of fact , i was just thinking that .
i was thinking , " why is mr. marshall here in my bedroom ?
you were ... thinking that just now ?
yeah , in my head .
i must have water in my ears or something .
but you' re , you know , not thinking anything now , are you ?
i' m thinking a million things .
really ?
because , you know , usually i can , uh
i can , uh
you are thinking something right this minute ?
mr. marshall , i am thinking that you are crazier than i am .
i think
i think i lost
it' s gone .
i' m back .
i' m back .
mr. marshall ?
yeah ?
i' m sorry .
is there something i can maybe do for you ?
no .
no , erin , uh
actually , i came here to see if i could do something for you .
for me ?
yeah .
see , the truth is
the truth
erin , the truth is ,
i' m glad i got here before you did anything to hurt yourself .
what makes you think that i would , uh , do something to hurt myself ?
i just sensed it .
really ?
you could sense that ?
well , that' s not that' s not good .
yeah .
but the real reason i' m here is because
well , here' s the thing .
the real reason i' m here is because
as you know we have the nike account , and we have a job opening in our team .
and darcy mcguire and i , we were just discussing really spitballing on who could be great enough to fill that void .
suddenly , your name popped into my head , and i remembered ... that you once applied for a job as a copywriter .
i thought i' d come down here and see if you were still interested .
didn' t you try and meet with me a while back ?
yeah , i tried , but you were unavailable , and then out of town
well , now i' m available .
and as you can plainly see i' m in town , so i' m here to take that meeting ... if you' re available .
i' m available .
i' m unbelievably available .
hi , this is darcy mcguire .
i' m not home right now , so please leave a message .
i' il get back as soon as i can .
darcy ?
hi , darcy , it' s nick .
uh , i' m standing right outside your place here .
i sure wish i could find you , get a hold of you .
are you all right ?
i hope so .
anyway , call me when you get this .
i' m on my cell .
triple five , 1 2 2 6 .
i really need to talk to you .
uh
just making sure you' re not there .
you' re not , right ?
no , i didn' t think so .
all right , so call me , please .
please .
bye .
darcy ?
no , it' s me .
gigi ?
uh is everything all right ?
are you back in town already ?
no , not until tomorrow .
alex called me three times from a pay phone really upset .
then we got disconnected .
what' s the matter ?
isn' t she at the prom ?
the prom .
excuse me .
do you know where alex marshall is ?
little tenth grader ?
brown hair ?
about this high ?
i saw her in the ladies ' room .
she' s been there for , like , an hour .
alex , are you in here ?
alex , it' s me .
what are you doing here ?
oh , honey , i just
you know , i can' t believe that i screwed up .
i wasn' t there when you left for the prom .
yeah , well , that' s not why i' m in here , so you can just go , okay ?
oh , boy , i feel awful .
are you okay ?
i mean , i
come on out .
let me see how you look , at least .
come on .
i look like crap !
i already took my hair out and everything .
so , you know , what happened ?
well , if i told you , you' d just freak out , so
what have you got to lose ?
try me .
okay .
cameron and his friends , they had this big plan .
they rented this hotel room and and
it was like a suite .
basically , i promised him that i was gonna
i can' t believe i' m gonna say this to you .
i promised him that i was gonna ... sleep with him after the prom .
and like an hour ago , we were on the dance floor and i said ,
i' m sorry , cameron .
you know , i' m just not ready .
good .
good girl .
dad , come on !
i' m sorry , i' m sorry .
go on .
then he goes , " well , the limo , the room and the tux , it all cost me 400 bucks .
and i said , " i' m sorry .
i' m just not
and he cuts me off and he says ,
i never should' ve asked a stupid sophomore to the prom .
what a waste .
then two seconds later , he goes and meets up with his old girlfriend ... and starts making out with her .
i mean , this disgusting slut with a tongue ring .
and then they were laughing and
i just can' t go out there ever .
oh , honey , i' m so proud of you .
dad !
what are you doing ?
i' m sorry .
i' m i' m sorry .
but i am .
and believe it or not ,
i know what it' s like to be a woman .
i mean , it' s not as easy as it looks .
but you stood up for yourself .
you know how ahead of the game you are ?
anyway , a guy that treats you like that and talks to you like that ,
he' s not  worth my time .
yes , i know .
it' s true .
he' s not .
and he' s a total game player , i hate that .
you are so much smarter than me .
and look at you .
that clown made out with a girl with a tongue ring over you ?
honey ... you look beautiful .
thanks .
take me home , dad .
what am i doing ?
she' s not in the refrigerator .
i wonder if it' s too late to go over there .
no , it' s not too late .
it' s never too late to do the right thing .
that' s what i' il do .
i' il go over there and i' il do the right thing .
hello ?
uh , hi , it' s me .
oh , i' m glad i found you .
uh
can i come up ?
darcy ?
i need to [ door buzzing ]
hey .
you need to what ?
it' s 1 : 00 in the morning .
i need to talk to you .
okay .
thanks .
so , you sleep here now ?
i thought i might as well give it a try before i have to sell the place .
sell it ?
you' re not selling the place .
can' t afford to keep it .
i don' t have a job .
you know , you ought to try returning some of your phone calls .
you got your job back .
oh , do i ?
you' re a riot .
you know that ?
it' s true .
dan told me so himself .
why would he tell you that ?
i didn' t do the job he hired me to do .
even i don' t blame him for firing me .
look , i' m , uh you can come on in .
i don' t have any chairs , but if you wanna
what if i told you that ... you did everything that you were hired to do everything but that someone was sabotaging you ?
picking your brain , swiping your ideas and
well , you you never even knew what hit you .
how is that possible ?
oh , trust me , it' s possible .
well , who would do such an awful thing ?
i would .
i was a dope with a corner office .
and when you came with the job i was supposed to have ,
i mean , it didn' t matter to me that ... you were better at it than me or you earned it more than i did .
as far as i was concerned , it was mine , and i was gonna get it back .
so i took advantage of you in the worst possible way .
have you ever done that ?
taken the wrong road and no , of course you haven' t .
you wouldn' t do that .
that' s just
somebody like me does that .
and , uh
the problem with that was that while i was digging the hole under you ...
i found out all about you .
and the more i found out ... the more you dazzled me .
i mean , shook my world , changed my life , dazzled me .
and guys like that ex husband of yours , he made you feel that ... the price you pay just for being you ... is that you don' t get to have love .
isn' t that what you were trying to say the other night ?
that you weren' t complete ?
that you weren' t really a winner ?
everything about you how smart you are , how good you are everything just makes me want you even more .
oh , wow .
boy .
so it looks like i' m here at 1 : 00 in the morning ... being all heroic trying to rescue you , but the truth is ...
i' m the one that needs to be rescued here .
i sure wish i could read your mind .
well , i was thinking that , um , if everything you' re saying is true , if i really have my job back ...
then i think you' re fired .
well , i never i never really thought about it from that angle .
well , not that i don' t deserve it .
i do do
i' m stuttering .
now i feel kind of , uh , embarrassed that i told you i needed to be rescued .
but that' s that' s fine .
that' s it ?
i don' t want that to be it .
i don' t want that to be it at all .
then don' t let a little thing like me firing you stand in your way .
i didn' t know what to react to first .
hey , news flash .
i took the wrong road .
what kind of knight in shining armor would i be ... if the man i love needs rescuing ... and i just let him walk out my door ?
my hero .
