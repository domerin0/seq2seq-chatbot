all my life , i' ve lived and worked in the big city , which , now that i think of it , is kind of a problem , since i always feel uncomfortable around crowds .
i mean it .
i have this fear of enclosed spaces .
l l l everything makes me feel trapped all the time .
you know , i always tell myself there' s gotta be something better out there .
but maybe l maybe i think too much .
l l i think everything must go back to the fact ... that i had a very anxious childhood .
you know , my mother never had time for me .
when you' re the middle child in a family of 5 million , you don' t get any attention .
i mean , how is it possible ?
and and i' ve always had these abandonment issues which plague me .
my father was was basically a drone , like i' ve said .
and , you know , the guy flew away when i was just a larva .
and my job , don' t get me started on , because it really annoys me .
l i was not cut out to be a worker , i' il tell you right now .
l l i feel physically inadequate .
my whole life , i' ve never been able to lift ... more than 10 times my own body weight .
and , when you get down to it , handling dirt is , you know [ shudders ] is not my idea of a rewarding career .
it' s this whole gung ho , superorganism thing ... that that , you know , i can' t get .
i try , but i don' t get it .
i mean what is it ?
i' m supposed to do everything for the colony .
and and what about my needs ?
what about me ?
i' ve gotta believe there' s someplace out there that' s better than this .
otherwise , i would just curl up in a larval position and weep .
the whole system makes me feel ... [ exhales ]
insignificant .
excellent .
you' ve made a real breakthrough .
i have ?
yes , z.
you are insignificant .
i am ?
## [ whistling ]
ground floor .
uh , worker .
soldier .
ooh .
uh oh .
worker .
let' s try it again .
firm grip .
swing hard .
back straight .
concentrate .
follow through .
okay .
i' ve got to keep a positive attitude .
a good attitude , even though i' m utterly insignificant .
i' m i' m insignificant , um , but with attitude .
oh , sorry , z.
i didn' t see ya .
great , azteca .
it' s working already .
i' m so meaningless , i' m invisible .
now , you' re getting it .
after all , it' s not about you .
it' s about us the team .
it' s about ... this .
uh , a giant hole in the ground ?
okay , people .
are we feeling good ?
yeah .
yeah .
great .
now , r 1734 through z 7829 , you guys are on wrecking ball .
you got it .
swell .
you got it .
all right .
swing time .
let' s get physical .
i love this job .
now , remember , azteca , " be the ball .
that' s the main thing .
now , remember that .
you know , gotta be one with the ball .
would you cut it out already ?
jeez .
i love my work .
and you , well
you think too much .
come on , z. help us build a bigger , better colony .
and , for cryin ' out loud , try to be happy about it .
sure , you know .
i mean , why why
how could i possibly be unhappy being a piece of construction equipment ?
okay , workers , remember .
here it comes .
be the ball .
oh !
let the energy flow through you .
grin and bear it .
this is this is for the colony .
oh .
ow .
this is
this is just a lawsuit waiting to happen .
hang on .
here we go .
faster .
harder .
did i happen to mention that heights make me nauseous ?
no .
this is a ball .
hey .
oh , z. yes .
yes .
i understand .
i dropped the ball .
workers .
they' re weak .
they lack discipline .
they lack commitment .
general , i know there' s been a glitch or two .
but everybody is working full tilt as it is , and
you can' t help it , it' s your nature .
but in spite of your limitations , you are going to finish this tunnel on schedule .
come hell or high water .
anyone who falls behind is going to have to explain themselves to colonel cutter .
and let me assure you , the colonel is not as understanding as i am .
dismissed .
four more days , cutter .
four more days .
then we can bid final farewell to their kind of incompetence .
yes , sir .
a fresh start .
lmagine it !
a strong colony , sir .
a colony we can be proud of .
yes , but we' re not there yet .
cutter , we just got word that a termite army has mobilized against us .
against us ?
we' il have to send troops deep into hostile territory ... to attack their colony .
attack a termite colony , sir ?
that' s suicide .
exactly .
do you have the list i asked for ?
yes , general .
these are the units loyal to the queen .
hm .
then they' re the ones we' il be sending .
it' s a shame .
there' s some fine officers here .
don' t we need the queen' s approval to declare war ?
our very next stop , cutter .
general , we' ve been at peace with that colony for years .
why would they attack us ?
they want our land .
they' re desperate for more foraging territory .
perhaps they think we' ve grown soft or weak .
why don' t we dispatch an ambassador , negotiate a new treaty ?
we don' t need to send soldiers .
believe me .
every ant in this colony is so precious to me .
that' s why we must strike now .
we have the element of surprise .
lf the termite shock troops enter our colony , well
yes , general , i know what they can do to us .
very well .
you' ve made a wise decision .
ln fact , you' ve insured the future of this colony .
hello , general .
princess bala .
what a nice surprise .
you look lovelier each time i see you .
thanks .
i hope you' re not just here on business .
oh , of course [ chuckles ] of course not .
because , um , it might be nice ... if we had a conversation once before we get married .
you' re absolutely right .
cutter , schedule some private time for me and princess bala .
uh , in fact , sir , there is time right now for a personal moment .
we' re a few seconds ahead of schedule .
excellent .
princess .
well , a few seconds isn' t much , but i guess if it' s quality time
so , how was your day ?
anything interesting happen ?
we declared war .
declared war ?
boy , talk about a rough day .
sir , i hate to interrupt , but time stands still for no ant .
princess .
mom , could you remind me , why am i marrying this guy ?
bala , do we have to argue about this again ?
we don' t seem to have anything in common .
the guy' s a stiff .
yes , darling .
i know the general may be ... a little gruff and somewhat overbearing at times , but i know that he cares about you .
he' s just not particularly good at showing it .
but you should' ve seen how persistently he asked for your hand in marriage .
but why me ?
because you' re the one who has to continue my work .
it' s your place , dear .
what if i don' t like my place ?
everyone has their place , bala you , the soldiers , the workers .
now , it' s not all that bad being princess , is it ?
would you prefer to be carting around dirt all day ?
mother , don' t be so dramatic .
at least , they seem to have some fun every now and then .
two aphid beers .
why' d i have to be born a worker ?
you soldiers get all the glory , plus you get to go out in the world .
you meet interesting insects , you get to kill them .
yeah .
but you get to spend all day with those ... beautiful worker girls .
weaver , they' re career girls .
they' re obsessed with digging .
i don' t think i' m ever gonna meet the right girl for me .
who said a girl for you ?
i was talking about a girl for me .
don' t you want your aphid beer ?
call me crazy , but [ clears throat ]
i have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature .
okay ?
suit yourself .
ahhh .
me , i' m cuttin ' loose .
we got royal inspection comin ' up .
lnspection , meaning you' re gonna stand around like an idiot ... while a bunch of blue bloods smirk at you .
i don' t know how you put up with it , weaver .
z , i' ve known you for a long time .
right ?
definitely .
you were born two seconds after me .
yeah .
and ever since we were little , i' ve been listenin ' to you complain .
what are you bitching about ?
ln case you haven' t noticed , we ants are running the show .
we' re the lords of the earth .
hey .
don' t talk to me about earth , okay ?
' cause i just spent all day hauling it around .
there' s just gotta be a better place .
there is .
i' ve been there .
i' m sor i' m sorry .
were you talking to me ?
there is a better place lnsectopia .
oh , really .
lunatic at 3 : 00 .
you can' t understand till you go there and see it yourself .
you can be your own ant there .
the streets are paved with food .
nobody tellin ' you what to do .
no wars .
no colony .
i shoulda never left .
oh , yeah .
fascinating .
we were on a long range recon .
i got cut off from my unit .
nothing like post traumatic stress disorder to make your day complete .
then i saw it lnsectopia !
hey !
you head towards the monolith .
ten clicks past the great canyons to the land of red and white .
hey , gramps .
you' ve had enough for one night .
come on .
before you get in trouble .
head for the monolith .
listen to me !
the monolith !
that guy' s got a screw loose .
cross the lake !
lnsectopia .
wouldn' t it be great if it were that easy ?
yeah .
dream on , z. cross the lake .
look for the land of red and white .
wow !
this is so ... gritty .
ten minutes and we' re out of here .
right ?
this place is off limits .
just blame it on me .
say it was all my idea .
it is all your idea .
besides , no one' s gonna recognize us .
come on , girls .
what do you say ?
let' s take a walk on the wild side .
okay , everybody .
6 : 15 .
time to dance .
time to cut a rug , z.
oh , no .
that' s okay .
i' m gonna leave the rug just the way it is , weaver .
## [ jazz , slow ]
step back , ladies .
i' m gonna ask one of these workers to dance with me .
oh .
what a bunch of losers .
mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system .
hi .
want to dance ?
absolutely .
follow me .
so , how come i haven' t seen you around here before ?
oh , i don' t get out much .
i , uh , i work over at the palace .
oh , the palace , huh ?
i bet those royals really live it up .
course they' re all a little you know from inbreeding .
what ?
yowch !
ya ya yowch !
yowch .
yowch .
what on earth are you doing ?
well , actually , to tell you the truth , i' m sort of making it up .
really ?
why does everybody have to dance the same way ?
that' s completely boring .
it' s it' s monotonous .
it' s no fun .
latin , up tempo ]
hey .
watch your step , worker .
you watch yours , buddy , or you' il be in big trouble .
th th that' s okay .
i' il i' m gonna let him off this time .
what ?
are you crazy ?
this guy' s built like a pebble .
aren' t you even gonna defend yourself ?
hey , buddy .
get back in place .
me ?
uh uh  what if he doesn' t want to ?
yeah .
what if i don' t like my place ?
what' s he talkin ' about ?
we got us a troublemaker .
buckle up , spanky .
this one goes out to all the lazy workers .
you ought to watch that aggressive behavior , buddy .
he' s just a worker .
princess bala !
princess bala !
the guards are coming .
let' s get outta here .
wait .
princess ?
you' re a princess ?
uh , i gotta go .
when can i see you again ?
let me think .

bye .
no .
wait .
# what a day it has been #
# what a rare mood i' m in #
# why , it' s almost like being in love #
# there' s a smile # huh ?
# on my face for the whole insect race #
# why , it' s almost like being in love ## [ whistle blows ]
yowch .
can i get you another one , pal ?
no , thanks .
i think i' m gonna go .
yeah .
i don' t blame you .
it' s always slow in here the night before one of those royal reviews .
i guess the soldiers need their shut eye before they meet the queen .
i don' t blame ya .
that' s it !
you know , i was once see ya .
psst .
weaver .
i figured it out .
weaver .
weaver .
what ?
what ?
i got a great idea .
you gotta switch places with me .
let me go to the inspection instead of you .
what time is it ?
weaver .
the royal family will be there .
this is the only way i can see her .
see who ?
princess bala .
are you nuts ?
you want me to switch places with you ?
do you know how much trouble you can get into ... for even talkin ' about impersonatin ' a soldier ?
you can get in trouble just for listenin ' ... to someone talkin ' about impersonatin ' a soldier .
you have to help me .
lf i can' t see her again , my life is not worth living .
pl pl please , weaver .
please .
switch jobs with me just for a day .
th think of all the things that i' ve done for you .
hm .
i can' t think of any .
okay .
so , think of all the things that i' m gonna do for you .
would i meet some worker girls ?
are you kidding ?
they always go after the new guy .
it' s like a sport for them .
and and believe me , they will definitely go ...
for an adorable little insect like you .
mmm .
weaver , l i have to see her again .
z , what kind of chance do you have with a princess ?
i mean , she probably won' t even remember you .
oh , boy .
## [ march ]
princess , fancy meeting you here .
what do you say we lose this crowd ?
oh , me ?
you know , l i wear many hats .

trial membership .

name' s barbatus .
z.
right face !
psst .
sacrifice .
to some , it is just a word .
to others , it is a code .
jeez .
i' m really bad at word games .
a soldier knows that the life of an individual ant doesn' t matter .
what matters is the colony .
he' s willing to live for the colony , to fight for the colony , to die for the colony .
this guy' s crazy .
i hear ya .
at 0800 hours , we received word that the termite enemy has mobilized .
we have no choice but to launch a preemptive strike .
you are the queen' s finest .
i know you will all do you duty .
i am proud to send you into battle .

you fill in any more , and you' il explode .
eh , you got a problem ?
no , uh uh
nobody told me digging was so much fun .
you know , you pick the dirt up .
you move it .
you pick it up again .
you move it again .
lots of reps .
you exercise the arms and the thorax .
yes , l i see what you mean .
um .
yeah .
that is fascinating .
sorry , sir .
i was just havin ' a chat with my friend , sir .
you know , i just had a chat with general mandible .
anybody who doesn' t meet his quota is going to be downsized .
come on .
cut him a break .
he' s new .
hey .
what do you say we help your attitude a little bit ... by taking away your rations for the day .
thanks for your time .
i don' t know what came over me .

i must be losin ' it .
sorry i got you in trouble .

it' s bound to be out there somewhere .
barbatus , hang on .
b barbatus .
don' t make my mistake , kid .
don' t follow orders your whole life .
think for yourself .
barbatus .
we' re on schedule .
work is completed on " a " section , sir .
we' re clearing a path through " d " section now .
we need to push harder , cutter .
i want double shifts around the clock .
we can' t afford to let up .
ls that clear ?
crystal , sir .
good .
what about section  excuse me , sir .
this had better be important .
well , it' s about the termite battle , sir .
the enemy was destroyed , but it was a disaster for our troops , as well .
well , that' s terrible .
terrible .
there is good news , sir .
one soldier did make it back .
no kidding .
what did you say ?
word is spreading through the colony .
the queen requested a meeting with the war hero .
damn !
good .
damn good .
uh , i' il handle this .
congratulations , soldier .
well , you' re a little short for a war hero , aren' t you ?
a war hero ?
sir , l i don' t actually think that i' m a hero .
good .
i don' t like heroes .
but , sir .
you don' t understand . l  [ crowd cheering ]
l i didn' t do anything .
i mean , it was all horrible .
it was just a massacre .
a a massacre upon a massacre .
that' s good , soldier .
now , wave .
there was nothing you could do , weaver .
you didn' t know they were going to war .
i just feel horrible .
poor z.
i should have never let him go .
wait a minute .
that' s no soldier .
that' s z !
z ?
the little guy made it !
let' s go , soldier .
as i was saying , son , you are an ant after my own heart .
an ant that looks death in the face and laughs .
well , actually , the truth is ,
l i generally just make belittling comments ... and snicker behind death' s back .
general mandible .
keep your comments to yourself .
let me do the talking .
may i present her majesty the queen .
charmed .
charmed .
and the royal princess bala .
welcome home , soldier .
we cannot begin to express our gratitude for your heroic efforts .
the private has asked me to convey his most humble appreciation .
please .
please .
it was nothing really .
just your average run of the mill valor ... and extraordinary courageousness , you know .
ln the heat of battle , there' s very little time to think .
one must attack !
attack !
attack !
well , indeed .
as you can see , your highness , the battlefield is still fresh in his mind .
so , begging your pardon , but this is the perfect time to debrief the private .
oh , please , general .
not on our first date .
not on our first date .
haven' t i seen you somewhere before ?
well , maybe .
then again , maybe not .
and then then again .
yowch .
that' s it !
you' re the guy from the bar .
don' t shh .
bar ?
what bar ?
i danced with this guy at the bar the other night .
he was just a worker then .
what were you doing at a bar ?
precisely what i want to know .
no .
this isn' t about me .
i mean , look at this worker .
look what he' s done .
i think you' re thinkin ' of someone else .
after all , i am a soldier .
exactly .
you were a worker .
but now , you' re a war hero .
he' s a worker ?
a worker danced with my fiancee ?
f fiancee ?
w w wait a minute .
this is not how it looks .
i can explain this .
hey .
she was the one making all the moves .
arrest him .
h hey wait a minute .
take it easy .
can' t we discuss this ?
what are you doing ?
let go of my daughter .
he' s taking her hostage !
no .
no .
i' m not .
i mean , yes , i am .
one more step and then the princess gets it .
let go of me !
ow !
don' t make me hurt her .
oh .
what are you doing , you creep ?
are you out of your puny little mind ?
there they are down there !
let' s go .
move .
move .
move .
oh , good .
here they come to rescue me and kill you .
kill ?
hey , you guys .
stop it .
stop it .
what are you tryin ' to do ?
get off me , you little twerp !
what do you want to do ?
throw away everything we' ve got ?
what' re you waiting for ?
hello .
guys .
huh ?
what is it ?
it' s beautiful .
ridgeway , get out of there !
oh .
don' t worry .
i' m okay .
you ?
you' re okay ?
hey .
who cares about you ?
i almost died here .
will you please calm down ?
you' re not gonna let a little near death experience ruin your mood , are you ?
hey .
this is not a mood .
you' re not listening to me .
where am i ?
look , what' s your name .
just climb up that tree and find out where i am .
look , t the trick is not to panic .
you know , h h he w who panics is lost .
what am i saying ?
we are lost .
ow !
i' ve been kidnapped by the village idiot .
who' s the bigger idiot , the idiot or the idiot who gets kidnapped by the idiot ?
what' d you do , talk those termites to death ?
i can' t believe you tried to pass yourself off as a soldier .
why are you stalking me ?
don' t you realize that i' m out of your league ?
you' re the one who was cruising the worker bar looking for a little action .
and you just happened to find it the swarthy , earthy , sensual worker .
please .
i was slumming it .
don' t you get it ?
i chose you because you were the most pathetic little bug in the joint .
i was gonna let you become part of my most erotic fantasies .
but now , you can forget that .
write it off , you know .
i guess what you prefer is old blood and guts .
this guy' s idea of a romantic night out is two seats at a public execution .
boy .
you really chose the right husband .
for your information , the general and i are deeply , deeply in engaged .
you come right back down here this instant .
we are marching straight back to the colony so that l
the monolith !
absolutely .
wonderful .
that' s an appealing offer .
but , considering the options , you go back .
okay ?
' cause i' m going to lnsectopia .
oh .
come on . lnsectopia ?
you' re crazier than i thought .
yeah .
well , i happen to have it on a very reliable source .
or or should i say , a drunk raving source ?
but the point is , i' m convinced the place definitely exists .
stop !
i order you to stop , worker !
hey .
i got a name .
okay ?
it' s z.
and out here , you can' t order me around .
all right .
fine .
no problem .
worker !
worker !
where are you ?
z ?
z ?
wait for me .
no more excuses , general .
i want my daughter back .
frankly , i' m beginning to doubt your ability to handle this .
believe me , your highness , we will spare no effort to bring her back .
princess bala is essential to all our plans for the future .
so he kills himself a hundred termites , gets a few medals , then bada bing , bada bip , bags himself the princess .
he looks him dead in the eye  and says , " bite me .
he said that to general mandible ?
buddy .
hey , hey , buddy .
you heard about the war hero named z ?
runs off with the princess , right ?
when they sent the guards after him , he just looks at ' em and boom !
they burst into flames .
z ?
you talkin ' about z ?
hey , i know the guy .
he' s a friend of mine .
i think your information
you know z ?
yeah .
he' s a worker .
he used to dig around here .
a worker ?
that' s impossible .
a worker can' t do anything , except work .
yeah .
it' s not like we got a choice .
we do have a choice .
uh , i mean , look at z.
he decided he wanted something , and he went for it .
he' s not alone .
i used to be a soldier , and i switched places with him .
wait a second .
you' re tellin ' me ...
i don' t have to be here ?
we' ve got a choice ?
the authorities don' t want you to know , but we don' t have to work on the tunnel anymore .
it' s the workers who control the means of production .
lf z don' t dig , i don' t dig .
people , what is this ?
an encounter group ?
let' s get back to work .
why ? ... on the tunnel anymore !
this guy , z he' s leadin ' the revolution !
i' il ... get back to you .
think about it , z two ants .
who ever heard of two ants ?
two million ants , maybe .
but two ?
look , i' m hungry , i' m thirsty .
and this whole desert thing ?
it just doesn' t work for me .
yada , yada , yada .
i think it' s about time for you to take me back .
take yourself back .
excuse me .
you kidnapped me , remember ?
that means you have certain responsibilities .
you can' t just abandon me here in the wilderness .
yeah , well , it' s better than being back at the colony .
you' re not serious , are you ?
maybe you were living the high life , but personally , this beats digging .
lf you' d ever done a day' s labor you' d know what i was talking about .
labor ?
what do you know about labor ?
how would you feel if you were expected to give birth ... every ten seconds for the rest of your life ?
gee .
water !
ahh .
all you think about is yourself .
yeah ?
well , nobody else ever thought about me .
so as far as i' m concerned , i don' t need anybody else .
uhh !
help !
help me , bala !
help !
b b b b bala !
hold on .
i' il get you out .
hold on .
help , ba  [ grunting ]
thanks .
don' t mention it .
now , maybe we can put this fantasy behind us ... and head back to the colon
oh , z !
what are you doing ?
we' ve gotta cross the lake .
am i missing something here ?
didn' t we just get out of the water ?
bala , look , what have you got to lose ?
i mean , think about it .
do you really want to be mrs. raving lunatic ?
there' s a better place .
z , please .
just ... gimme one chance .
lf we don' t find lnsectopia soon ,
i promise i' il take you back to the colony .
i hope you know what you' re doing .
yeah , me too .
we want z !
we want z !
people , come on .
i know some ants who aren' t gonna make their quota .
buzz off , pawn of the oppressor .
we want z !
we want z !
sorry , sir .
i came as soon as i heard .
i was debriefing the trackers .
and ?
what' s the report ?
well , this z , sir
he' s one slippery character .
they lost bala' s trail at the edge of the lake .
the lake ?
# all we are saying #
# ls give z a chance ##
what' s that soldier doing there ?
it appears he' s holding hands , sir ... with a worker .
i don' t like the way things are going , cutter .
i' m counting on you for results .
now , can i depend on you or not ?
yes , sir .
all right , then .
let' s wrap this up .
we want z !
we want z !
we want z !
i' ve heard a lot about this z.
i even had the pleasure of meeting him once .
but where is he now ?
can anyone point him out ?
i mean , if this z cares so much about us , then why isn' t he here ?
i' il tell you why .
because z doesn' t give a damn about us .
that' s why he kidnapped our princess .
that' s why he ran away .
z is no hero .
we are the heroes .
we are the ones ensuring the future of our great colony .
and when we' ve completed this magnificent structure , we will reap the benefits : more food and less work for everyone .
and as further reward for your heroic efforts , each and every one of you will get the day off , [ excited murmurings ]
so you can be the guests of honor at the megatunnel dedication ceremonies !
mandible !
mandible !
mandible !
mandible !
mandible !
mandible !
now bring me that soldier .
oh , my god !
z !
come here !
it' s lnsectopia !
you were right .
it really is here .
huh ?
all right .
all right !
you' re a genius .
let' s eat .
mmph !
huh .
well ?
what' s the problem ?
there' s some kind of force field .
uh , excuse me .
excuse me .
how do you get in ?
yes , well , i' m afraid this is a private function .
who are your friends , dear ?
crawling insects , poopsie .
oh .
the poor dears .
uh , good morning .
huh ?
darling , really .
greeting every insect that emerges out of the grass ?
pardon me .
i guess you don' t recognize me .
i' ve been traveling and i' m all ... schlumpy .
i' m princess bala .
oh !
it' s even worse .
they' re eurotrash .
darling , they' re poor .
they' re dirty .
they' re smelly .
we have to help them .
lf you' il just wait right here , we' il fetch you a little something .
oh , please , muffy .
not another crusade .
chippie , we have a social obligation to the less fortunate .
i know you laugh at my hobbies , but this is important to me !
mm .
you have such a big heart .
that' s why you' re my little cuddly widdles .
oh , my big , strong pheromone factory .
mmm !
oh !
oh , brother .
suddenly i' ve lost my appetite .
you know ...
oh !
i guess i had imagined lnsectopia
i don' t know a little differently .
oh , muffy !
no !
oh , no !
oh , no .
look out !
z , help me !
z !
don' t let me don' t let me go , z.
get me out of here !
bala !
whoa , this is not good .
whoa !
whoa oa oa !
whoa oa oa !
hi .
z ?
yes ?
it looks like this is it , just when ...
i was starting to like you .
who the hell is that ?
uhh !
that' s enough .
i ain' t tellin ' you nothin ' .
soldier , the princess is vital to the future of this colony .
she must be returned to take her proper place as queen .
we already have a queen .
as for your friend z , why should i hurt him ?
he' s not important .
now , soldier , we all know that one individual ant doesn' t matter .
not you ...
not cutter ...
not even her .
azteca !
don' t tell that tight ass anything , weaver !
aagh !
where is z ?
i don' t know where he is !
hmm .
that' s too bad .
wait ! lnsectopia .
uhh !
i know it sounds crazy , but that' s where he' d be going .
soldier , you think this is a game ?
lnsectopia does not exist .
as a matter of fact ... it does .
sir ?
i' il brief you on the coordinates .
you' re gonna bring the princess back .
and as for z ... kill him .
but you said he didn' t matter .
it' s for the good of the colony .
you made the right decision .
gentlemen , now you can see ... how dangerous individualism can be .
it makes us ... vulnerable .
let' s go .
take him back to the megatunnel .
put him on the front line .
dismissed .
jeez , what was i thinking ?
i almost got you killed .
z , you know , you really shouldn' t be so hard on [ straining ]
that' s it .
i' m taking you back to the colony .
uhh !
ow !
oh .
uhh !
lnsectopia .
you know , i must' ve been crazy .
z ?
but you know what ?
i can admit it when i' m wrong .
z.
and this time , i gotta tell ya , i was absolutely , 100 % ... correct .
have have you ever seen anything more beautiful in your life ?
it' s ... lnsect  shh !
don' t jinx it .
come on !
# i can see clearly now the rain is gone #
# i can see all obstacles in my way #
# gone are the dark clouds that had me blind #
pardon us . # it' s gonna be a bright #
# bright , bright # # bright sunshiny day #
# it' s gonna be a bright #
# bright , bright # # bright sunshiny day #
# look all around nothing but blue skies #
# look straight ahead nothing but #
# blue skies #
# whoa #
# i can see clearly now the rain is gone # [ buzzing ]
# i can see all obstacles in my way ##
all right , everybody .
i want all teams in place , fully prepared , ready to seal the doors here and here .
make certain the digging crew stays on schedule ... for breakthrough midway in the dedication ceremony .
now all we need is the princess .
mm .
this stuff tastes like crap .
really ?
let me try some .
hey , it is crap .
not bad .
somebody needs to feed that fire .
dude , i did it last time .
i' m not gonna get it .
it' s not my job .
what about the new guy ?
he hasn' t contributed yet .
and ... [ sighs ] you know , he just died in my arms like that .
l you know , i don' t think he ever once in his life ... made his own choice .
i never knew it was like that .
i mean , up in the palace
well , i guess we just let the general make all the decisions .
let me ask you something .
what made you come to the bar that night ?
i guess i was looking for a little trouble .
well , [ chuckles ] trouble' s my middle name .
actually , my middle name is marion , but , uh ,
i don' t want you to spread that around .
you' re pretty strange .
you do know that , don' t you ?
well , [ clears throat ] strange' s not exactly the word i would use .
i like it .
you' re not like anyone else .
actually , now that you mention it , there is a certain strangeness to me .
i mean , it' s a , you know , kind of a bizarre quality .
some have said " freak .
but it' s , uh , you know , complimentary .
hey , new guy .
we need more wood .
i' il be right back .
just hold that thought whatever it is you were thinking .
hey , you ever wonder why they call you guys " pests " ?
what if , like , we' re just these tiny little things ... and we' re just , like , part of this whole other huge universe ... that' s , like , so big we don' t even know it exists ?
man , that is so deep .
perfect .
nothing like a little manual labor ... on the most romantic night of my life .
hi .
i was in the neighborhood and i thought i' d drop in .
this is , uh , very bohemian .
aloha , dude .
welcome to lnsec [ groans ]
sorry for interrupting .
you see , our princess has , uh , gone missing , and we' re just sick about it .
she' s about yea tall , fairly easy on the eyes .
anybody seen her ?
that' s her .
don' t worry , princess , you' il be back home soon .
listen , cutter , i' m i' m not going back .
the thing is , princess , i got orders .
orders ?
can' t you just once think for yourself ?
well , that was very impressive .
where' s z ?
z ?
he' s , uh  dead .
z' s dead .
you don' t need to worry about him .
z' s dead .
well , he was an ant with ideas .
too bad for him .
princess , your colony needs you .
cutter !
stop right now !
let go of me !
bala !
stop , you oh , no .
what am i gonna do ?
all right , look .
let' s be rational about this .
you know , bala and i , you know , she' s a princess ... and i' m a i' m a soil relocation engineer .
so wha you' re no whew !
on the other hand , uh ...
i' ve gotta go back for her .
i' il i' il give you a lift .
s s s whoa !
ohh !
it' s the least i can do .
besides , it' s what my waddly kiddles would want .
uh , look , [ clears throat ] how about a cup of joe first ?
well , old boy ... saddle up .
i think i saw a puddle of coffee over there .
lt whoa !
look out !
ah , princess .
you' re just in time .
take your hands off me .
general , what exactly is going on here ?
i demand an explanation .
i' il explain everything afterwards .
ls the southeast entrance secure ?
yes , sir .
not afterwards .
now .
i don' t like the way you think and i don' t like the way you run this colony .
and i don' t like you .
the wedding is off .
things are going to change around here .
you' re right , princess .
things are going to change .
why don' t we make her more comfortable ?
she' il be here for a while .
what do you think you' re doing ?
my mother will have your head .
i doubt that .
ah , you' ve got a fighter spirit , bala .
and that' s just what we need to start our new colony .
we will rinse away all the filth from our gutters .
we' il start anew , with you by my side as my queen .
you' re crazy .
i believe history will see things differently .
all right , gentlemen .
time to take your positions .
someday someday you' il thank me .

but they' re gonna seal everybody off in the megatunnel .
and ... here' s the lake .

we gotta get down there .
today is the realization of a dream .
a dream of a proud colony .
a pure colony .
a colony reborn .
moments from now this tunnel will open .
the past will be washed away and a new day will dawn .
a stirring speech , general .
i only wish my daughter were here to appreciate it .
your majesty , i know how concerned you are about bala .
but my scouts are on her trail and it' s only a matter of time
general , i don' t want to discuss it .
just find her .
i will , your highness .
good bye .
seal up the doors .
cutter , did you hear me ?
sir , i' ve been thinking .
do we need to go through with this ?
look at what these workers have done .
they got the right stuff .
lsn' t there any other way ?
cutter , you' re a fine officer .
you have discipline , courage , ability .
but you seem to have a weakness for the lower orders that i find disturbing .
now , are you with me ?
sir , uh ...
i apologize .
all right , then .
seal it up .
yes , sir .
as i look out on this magnificent tunnel ,
i am filled with pride .
jump !
ln these difficult times , it is a great solace to know that you , our workers
mom !

every worker in the colony is here .
wait a minute .
that guy owes me money .
this tremendous accomplishment is a testimony to the strength
put your backs into it !
go warn your mother .

there' s not enough time .
hey , leave the pessimism to me , okay ?
ow !
ooh !

ln a few moments when our expert diggers break through to the surface ,
mom !

on whose authority ?
on your own authority .
lf you break through that wall , we' re all gonna
drown .
this tunnel is going to flood .
so we' ve got to get everyone out of here .
look , i got orders , and those orders say " dig .
what if someone ordered you to jump off a bridge ?
oh , brother , i' m asking the wrong guy .
look , think for yourselves !
gimme that !
i' ve had enough out of you .
get back to work .
what' s that noise ?
uh oh .

everyone , listen to me .
we' ve all been deceived .
we need to calmly head toward the exits .
run for your lives !
it' s gonna flood !
no .
don' t panic .
don' t panic !
every ant for himself !
all the exits are blocked !
we' re trapped !
what are we going to do ?
there' s nothing we can do !
yes , there is .
weaver , give me a leg up .
everyone , listen to me !
who the heck are you ?
he' s z !
listen , we gotta help each other get outta here before we all drown .
how ?
by making a ladder .
a ladder !
hey , if we built this , we can do anything .
okay , let' s move it !
i' m on it .
all of you , gather round .
you , start climbing .
grab my arm .
all right .
here i go .
come on .
go , go , go !
right !
excuse me , your majesty .
z , i' ve gotta help my mom .
don' t worry .
i know almost exactly what i' m doing .
i' il see you at the top .
gentlemen , there comes a time ... in the evolution of a perfect colony ... when the strong are meant to rise above the weak .
now is that time .
below us right now , the weak elements of the colony ... are being washed away .
oh , my god , we' re not gonna make it !
we need more ants .
you two better get up there .
weaver , you can' t hold it alone .
get going .
hang in there , buddy .
got it !
hurry up !
go , go , go , go !
our princess is secured , and our glorious future is at hand .
we can all stand proud .
it is time for a new beginning .
what the hell is that ?
i think that' s the weak element , sir .
gimme gimme a hand !
z !
you ?
let go !
don' t you understand ?
it' s for the good of the colony .
wha what are you saying ?
we are the colony !
cutter ... what are you doing ?

this is for the good of the colony , sir .
you useless , ungrateful maggot !
i am the colony !
look out !
oof !
aa aah !
aa aa aah !
z !
men , let' s move it !
get these ants up here .

thank goodness we made it .

give him some air .
back up .
z , oh , z.
please wake up .
oh , no !
huh !
yowch !
you know , weaver , you still owe me that dinner .
babylove .
we made it , z !
you da ant !
eh !
you did it .
we did it .
oh !
fellas !
fellas , please !
this is very embarrassing for me , l  [ laughing ]
on the other hand , i probably could get used to this .
there you have it .
your average " boy meets girl , boy likes girl , boy changes underlying social order`` story .
so , what else can i tell you ?
we rebuilt the colony .
it' s even better than before .
you know , ' cause now it has a very large indoor swimming pool .
bala and i , incidentally , are thinking of starting a family , you know , just a few kids maybe a million or two to begin with .
and i' m workin ' with a new therapist , you know , terrific , absolutely terrific .
he' s been putting me in touch with my inner maggot , which is helping me a great deal .
and , you know , i finally feel like i' ve found my place .
and you know what ?
it' s right back where i started .
but the difference is , this time i chose it .
# just what makes that little old ant #
# think he' il move that rubber tree plant #
# anyone knows an ant can' t move a rubber tree plant #
# but he' s got high hopes #
# he' s got high hopes #
# he' s got high apple pie in the sky hopes #
# so anytime you' re gettin ' low #
# ' stead of lettin ' go just remember that ant #
# oops , there goes another rubber tree plant #
# oops , there goes another rubber tree plant #
# oops , there goes another rubber tree plant #
# once there was a silly old ram #
# thought he' d punch a hole in a dam #
# no one could make that ram scram #
# he kept buttin ' that dam #
# ' cause he had high hopes #
# he had high hopes #
# he had high apple pie in the sky hopes #
# so anytime you' re feelin ' bad ' stead of feelin ' sad #
# just remember that ram #
# oops , there goes a billion kilowatt dam #
# oops , there goes a billion kilowatt dam #
# oops , there goes a billion kilowatt dam #
# so keep your high hopes #
# keep your high hopes #
# keep those high apple pie in the sky hopes #
# a problem' s just a toy balloon #
# they' il be bursting soon they' re just bound to go pop #
# oops , there goes another problem ker plop #
# oops , there goes another problem ker plop #
# oops , there goes another problem ker plop #
