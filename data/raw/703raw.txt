lynn swann .

the only thing better than a crawfish dinner is five crawfish dinners .

not exactly what i' d call constructive criticism .
smell like you could use a shower , stinky .

captain lnsano ,
i notice sometimes when you are wrestling or or openin ' up a can of whoop ass , as you like to say

you , sir . alligators are aggressive because of an enlarged medulla oblongata .
it' s the sector of the brain which controls aggressive behaviour .
that is correct !
the medulla oblongata .
the medulla oblongata ... is where anger , jealousy and aggression come from .
now , is there anybody here can tell me where happiness comes from ?

that that that' s a good question . in the right position all the time ?
what what happens is , the the the centre has has the ball first . and and and the quarterback will say , " hike .
that' s when the c center puts the ball in into the hands of the quarterback .
so what i do is , l i start tacklin ' the quarterback , unless he give the ball to to s somebody else , in which case , l i try to tackle that person .
hmm ?
don' t smoke crack .

you ain' t even a man .
it looks like the cinderella s. c. l. s. u. mud dogs ,
led by linebacker bobby boucher , are gonna fall one victory short of that bourbon bowl bid .
lowa could win the game by nailing this 20 yard field goal .
yeah , but the mud dogs have played a sensational football game .
let' s take a look at the way boucher entered the hawkeyes ' last drive .
here we see boucher instantly penetratin ' the pocket .
there' s a lot of pain and shame in those eyes .
friends , it' s all over .

wow , that is a disturbing image .

with yesterday' s come from behind victory , the s. c. l. s. u. mud dogs ... earned a new year' s day date with red beaulieu and the louisiana cougars ... in the first annual bourbon bowl .
but not only has the waterboy changed s. c. l. s. u. ' s fortunes , he' s got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent .
ln fact , yesterday , michigan , devastated by injury , experimented with their towel boy at wide receiver .
but the towel boy ran into [ cheering ]
you know , when i see so many of you here tonight , it reminds me just about how special this season really was .
not just for the team .
not just for the students .
but for each and every one of you ... in our small corner of louisiana !
you can do it !
oh , yes , we can , and , yes , we will .
because we' ve got ... a young man who has been so vital to our success . a wonderful student athlete .
and a wonderful friend .
ladies and gentlemen , bobby boucher !
** [ band ]
waterboy , number one !
you can do it !
thank you so much ... for bein ' my friends .

i' d also like to take this opportunity ... to tell you that my mama don' t know how i play football , so if if you could not tell my mama l i play football , [ cheering ]
** [ band resumes ]
we must be a little lost .
we' re tryin ' to get to the bourbon bowl .

hey , waterboy , you fixin ' to tackle all of us ?
kick his water lovin ' ass , greg .
i asked you a question , dumb ass .

i mean , whatever it is , we don' t want this to get physical .
right , klein ?
yeah , well , your team actin ' like a bunch of shitheads .
this is not how ambassadors for the university of louisiana
so now you just get back on the bus .

however , assault with a deadly weapon , very , very serious offence .
officer , get her little country ass outta here .
thank you , vicki .
let' s go . ah !
it' s the waterboy !
i got something for you .
this is his transcript from south lafayette high school ... in cherokee plains , louisiana .
now , the problem with that ... is there ain' t no south lafayette high school in cherokee plains , louisiana .
so obviously , this is a fake !
however , this is not a fake .
this is from the n. c. a . a .
they don' t think you ought to play football no more .
you' re fired .
oh , no !
we suck again !
ever see a championship ring ?
don' t be messin ' with the champ .
come on , laski .
i was home schooled .
l i didn' t know i needed  you didn' t go to high school ?
forged a fake transcript .
no , no , l l i didn' t .
the waterboy' s a cheater .
cut his head off .
listen , everybody !
this don' t change nothin ' !
we played as a team , we won as a team . and just because the waterboy' s a cheater , don' t change the fact that the real mud dogs ... are gonna kick some cougar ass .

thank you so much .
bye bye .
good news , bobby .
the n. c. a . a . is gonna allow you to play in the bourbon bowl .
you just have to pass the high school equivalency test .
yes .
it' s not the test , coach .
everybody hates me .
that' s not true .
one man said he wanted to decapitate me .
nobody else thought that to be too bad of an idea .
somebody made me look like a a a cheater .
i did it .
i did it .
i did it !
i did it !
i did it !
it was me .
why ?
because i wanted you to play .
because you were my way out , bobby .
' cause it was the only way to get you in .
i am so sorry .
why didn' t you s stick up for me down by the river ?
the truth is , i fled .
i came into my office , i went under my desk , i cried .
i cried .
i cried like a ten year old girl !
red and i have a history .
twenty years ago , we were assistants to coach cavanaugh ... at the university of louisiana .
red ran the practices , and i used to come up with the plays .
oh , boy , was i good .
i would write these foolproof plays in my little green notebook that i had .
the opposition didn' t even know what hit ' em . and when coach cavanaugh was going to retire , [ door knocking ]
me and red , we just knew that one of us was gonna be his successor .
** [ disco ]
hey , red .
how ya doin ' ?
come by to wish me luck ?
well , not exactly , no , no . actually , i come by to get you
sure .
what' s up ?
well , you know that green notebook you use to write
well , i need to show cavanaugh that i can come up with some good play ideas . all them football plays in ?
but you didn' t come up with them .
they' re my plays .
i need them .
klein , i' m gonna have this book one way or another , so you might as well let the damn thing go , ' cause if you don' t , it' s gonna get awfully , awfully physical around here . and i don' t think you want that , do you ?
huh ?
of course , red got the job .
next day , fired me .
once he had my notebook , he didn' t need me any more .
i didn' t take it very well .
no , grandma , i didn' t get it .
i can' t believe it myself .
i know .
i' m so numb .
i just hate him , i hate him , i hate him .
that is a terrible story , coach .
but why why don' t you just come up with some new plays ?
i can' t .
yes .
i tried .
i guess i have a mental block , you know , ever since red took
i knew what he was gonna do ! and i just didn' t fight back .
well , you' re gonna show him that you' re a man on saturday .
and i' m gonna show everybody that i' m not a dummy .
i' m gonna go study .
** [ fiddle ]
mama , maybe you could stop brushin ' my hair so i can read .

bobby boucher , all these folks are here tonight ... to tell you that they' re sorry that they' re sorry for not supportin ' you ... when it meant the most .
but you do have friends , and one of ' em wants to say somethin ' .
come on .
i am not what you would call a handsome man .
the good lord chose not to bless me with with charm , athletic ability or a fully functional brain .
you see , you' re an inspiration ... to all of us who , who weren' t born handsome ... and charming and cool and [ sobbing ]
i can' t !
i can' t !
it' s okay .
bobby , if your mama could only hear us right now , we would tell her ... what a fine boy she raised , and how much your playing football means to this town .
but she can' t hear you , ' cause she' s unconscious .
i' m sorry to disappoint you all , but please keep your voices down ... so my mama can get her rest .
well , wake her ass up !
we gotta win tomorrow !
mama !
thank god , you' re okay .
i' m so sorry .
i was so bad , mama .
you were right about everything .
i' ve been a real knucklehead .
oh , hush , baby .
you should' ve seen this a long time ago .
oh , my word !
ls that my daddy ?
no , no .
that' s a guy i dated before i met your father .
oh , you could iron a shirt on his stomach .
well , that was lust , not love .
turn the page .
there' s your daddy .
so handsome .
oh .
read on .
dear helen .
who' s helen ?
that' s my first name , bobby .
ohh !
i have arrived here in new orleans .
it is even more beautiful than in the picture books .
i' m sure i' il have no problem finding work ,
so you can expect my next letter to contain lots of money .
your loving husband , robert .
that' s nice , mama .
dear helen .
that' s you .
i found a job as a lemonade vendor ,
but sorry , no money yet .
new orleans is an expensive city .
expensive , but fun .
hope all is well .
robert .
this will be my last letter .
we have grown apart over these last six weeks .
i now have two loves in my life : " big city livin ' and a voodoo woman named phyilis .
ciao , roberto .
he changed his name to roberto .
i guess he thought it was more exotic .
but mama says that i mean , you say that
bobby , your daddy didn' t go into no peace corps .
he deserted us , baby .
no , no , mama .
you you
you shouldn' t be dredgin ' up these painful memories in your condition .
oh , hush .
your mama' s as healthy as an ox , and as dumb as one to boot .
i was so scared you' d abandon me too . and i made you abandon all those people who depend on ya .
i hid you away from the world , bobby boucher .
but i can' t hog you to myself no more , because everyone' s seen how wonderful you are .
oh , mama !
now .
you go play fool' s ball with your friends .
welcome to abc' s coverage of the bourbon bowl .
good afternoon , everybody .
i' m brent musburger , and the big story here , dan , is a game that' s lost some of its lustre ... along with my colleague , dan fouts . without its star player , the waterboy bobby boucher .
you know , red' s got a couple of solid early rounders out there .
i know , but i really wanted to scout that waterboy .
reminds me of greg lloyd .
naw .
zack " thomas .
whatever .
ls she ready ?
oh , yeah .
she' s more than ready .
come on , bobby !
you' il miss the boat !
let' s go , ladies .
we are underway !
the opening kickoff is a beauty !
holdsworth is gonna bring it out from nine yards deep .
come on .
yeah !
dan , they' re showing no respect for this team without boucher .
good reason , brent .
109 yards untouched .
touchdown , cougars !
they strike first .
time running down in the first quarter .
cougars lead is 17 0 .
set !
three !
thirty three !
three !
thirty three !
hut !
dan , that quarterback can' t even get the ball off before he' s hit .
it' s as if they' re in the offensive huddle with him .
are you gonna finish that hot dog , jimmy ?
ugh !
now i' m not .
mama , you think we' il make it on time ?
hang on !
i' il show you what a . j. foyt taught me .
that' s the end of the half .
the cougars are dominating .
let' s hope the mud dogs can make some adjustments .
well , they better , ' cause they suck .
mm hmm .
anybody got an idea ?
hey .
remember the time bobby tackled the referee by mistake ?
yeah , that was pretty funny .
how about the time he tackled the guy from louisville ...
and threw him into the stands ?
y' all remember when he intercepted the ball and his pants fell off ? and then he ran for the touchdown , bare assed .
remember the time bobby [ mumbling lncoherently ]
remember when bobby boucher showed up at halftime and the [ cheering , shouting ]
hey , sorry about givin ' you so much shit this year .
you' re the heart and soul of this team , bobby . and the only one of us who could' ve passed that test .
thank you all so much for being my friends .
well , let' s wait till later to hold hands and kiss .
right ?
yeah !
we got a bowl game to win .
two , three !
mud dogs !
woof !
ln a dramatic turn of events ,
bobby boucher just arrived at halftime . and on a fan boat , brent .
his mother drove him right into the stadium .
waterboy !
waterboy !
waterboy !
waterboy !
waterboy !
waterboy !
fool' s ball' s not for the devil .
it' s for my bobby .
time to open up some whoop ass .
shit , he showed up . all right , look .
just relax .
relax .
go in there and do exactly like we planned .
go , go , go !
this could be the start of some high drama , folks .
or are the mud dogs too far behind ?
bobby boucher is on defence .
the cougars are coming out from their own 20 yard line .
the pitch .
it' s a reverse !
hut !
hut !
boucher' s not fooled .
fumble !
robideaux' s got it !
touchdown , mud dogs !
boy , boucher knocked the poop out of him .
slap hands !
slap hands !
drink up , now .
i want you girls to sober up .
have faith in my bobby .
the mud dogs are faced with yet another third and long .
hut !
grenouille back to pass .
he' s gonna be stuffed again ! and the mud dogs offence is
but the way their defence is fired up , they still have still unable to move that ball .
blake , come here .
look .
now , what if we , uh [ whispering ]
trust me .
go , go , go , go , go .
the cougars lead 27 7 in the middle of the third quarter . and he takes a knee ?
y' all gonna play or what ?
how do you all like my new offence ?
all right , it' s second and 12 ...
as the cougars line up on the ball .
hut !
hut !
what is red beaulieu doing , refusing to play offence ?
dan , this is bizarre .
no , it' s not , brent .
it' s brilliant , because red is taking the waterboy out of the game .
by kneeling down three times and punting , he' s gonna make the mud dog offence try to beat him . and the way they' re playing today , that' s impossible .
well , the mud dog' s most valuable player , the linebacker they call " the waterboy , " is now powerless .
that means coach klein will have to find another way to outfox red .
mud dogs call a time out .
mr coach klein .
mr coach klein !
mr coach klein !
where are you going ?
i was just gonna get a hot pretzel .
mr coach klein , are you afraid of red beaulieu ?
i am petrified of him .
well , why don' t you pretend that red beaulieu ... is somebody that you' re you' re not afraid of . pretend ?
yes .
visualize somebody you' re not afraid of . and then attack , like you told me .
i' il try .
well , he' s right over there .
little baby .
yeah .
hello , little baby .
a poo poo ?
do you have a poo poo ?
yes .
okay .
now .
this is what we' re gonna do .
he' s gonna come here [ chattering , shouting ]
come and get this one , cougars .
red , 22 !
hike !
snap to grenouille . a reverse !
no , it' s a double reverse !
oh , what a block ! and boudier springs free !
trouble !
lateral !
got him !
what a play !
grenouille to the 15 !
to the 10 !
to the 5 !
touchdown , mud dogs !
well , well , well .
i guess coach klein does have a few tricks up his sleeve after all .
what the hell what the hell is this ?
huh ?
we go from a championship football team to a bunch of dogs !
right now , we' re going to go down to the sidelines and our man , lynn swann .
swannie , what do you have for us ?
i' m with vicki vallencourt , who' s taking over ...
bobby boucher' s water duties for this important game .
oh , i' m not takin ' over .
i' m just tryin ' not to screw up too bad .
well , let me ask you this .
what' s your prediction for
mud dogs are gonna win , 30 to 27 . the rest of this ball game ?
that' s very interesting .
how' d you come up with that guess ?
guess ?
that ain' t no guess !
that' s what it' s gonna be .
okay .
that' s fine .
oh !
be careful down there , swannie .
all right .
meaney .
where' s meaney ?
meaney ?
here , coach .
get in there and let' s see if that waterboy can stop you .
red is sending his best defender in as a running back ?
yes , sir !
what do you make of this , dan ?
well , brent , he' s gotta find some way to neutralize the waterboy .
he probably thinks that meaney will just pound it in there like
hey , waterboy ! ls your girlfriend gonna save you again ?
fridge used to do for the bears .
oh , no , sir .
i' m gonna take matters into my own hands .
you' il see .
bring it to the hole !
whoo !
whoo !
you sound like a ... a big choo choo train .
whoo !
power bomb , compliments of captain lnsano .
* let' s go fight with your might ** all right , field goal .
field goal .
go .
derek .
derek !
yeah .
visualize the attack .
go kick the ball .
kick it .
hut !
how you doin ' , boy ?
no , no , no !
what the hell is that ?
where the hell is what the hell is he up to ?
that ain' t in here !
huh ?
hey !
down by ten late in the fourth quarter ,
coach klein opts for the field goal .
then they have to hope for the onside
dan , look what we have here .
boucher' s in the game as a blocker . kick and a touchdown to tie the game .
last game of the year , brent .
can' t hold anything back now .
set !
the snap .
it' s a fake !
boucher' s out in front ! a great block !
and a second one !
touchdown , mud dogs !
boucher led him all the way !
yeah !
red beaulieu is steaming , dan .
brent , he sees his perfect season slipping away .
the cougar' s lead is down to three .
the mud dogs need the ball back if they' re gonna have a shot at overtime . and bobby boucher is now on the kickoff team .
last game of the year , brent .
can' t hold anything back now .
who' s it gonna be ?
i know .
who' s it gonna be ?
who' s it gonna be ?
oh , yeah .
there' s my bitch .
remember , the ball must travel ten yards .
it' s loose !
mud dogs football !
mud dogs football ! all right !
mama , i got the football !
i got it
oh , what a vicious hit !
that was a cheap shot .
oh !
that puts the mud dogs in field goal range for the tie .
dan , i' m not sure that boucher is able to get back up .
it' s still cold .
oh , my baby !
excuse me .
out of my way .
dan , you hate to see this happen .
now , that' s high quality h2o .
you go on , now !
the waterboy just needed some water .
make it happen , bobby !
wow , dan .
you think that up all by yourself ?
are you okay ?
shut up , brent .
he tried to open up a can of whoop ass on me .
i wouldn' t let him .
listen , i have an idea for the last play .
you haven' t done this before . all right ?
the offence is gonna line up like this .
yeah .
you' re gonna be right here .
there' il be no tie here today .
coach klein is sending his offence back on to the field .
he' s going for the win right now .
yeah , this is a real gutsy call , brent .
he' il either be a hero or a goat because of this .
he is now playing offence !
we know .
we know .
meaney , if they give that waterboy the football ,
i don' t care if you have to stab him !
do not let him get away .
do you understand me ?
yes , sir .
yes , sir !
do you understand me ?
get in there !
break !
i' m ready , friend .
let' s do it , bobby .
set !
set !
forty three !
set !
forty three !
hut , hut !
touchdown !
they win it !
the mud dogs win it !
bobby boucher' s the hero !
he' s gone from waterboy , dan , to saviour ! and it' s because he didn' t hold anything back !
well , swannie' s down on the field with our hero , so let' s go to lynn now !
we did it !
i can' t believe it !
i can' t believe it !

* every time i kiss your lips *
* my mind starts to wander *
* and if all my dreams come true *
* i' il be spending time with you *
* i love you more today than yesterday *
* but not as much as tomorrow *
* oh , i love you more today than yesterday *
* but , darling , not as much *
* as tomorrow *
* tomorrow may see springtime just a day away *
* day away *
* cupid , we don' t need you now be on your way *
* on your way *
* thank the lord for love like ours *
* that grows ever stronger *
* and if all my dreams come true *
* i' il be spending time with you *
* oh , i love you more today than yesterday *
* but not as much as tomorrow *
* oh , i love you more today than yesterday *
* but , darling , not as much *
* as tomorrow *
