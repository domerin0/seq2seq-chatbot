let him go .

any other time , that punk would die , but i can' t do that shit no more .
don' t want to burn nobody , even when i know i should .
that ain' t me now .
all i want is to get my $75, 000 and get out .

since when are you a tough guy ?
get yourself killed .
i can take care of myself .
you think i' m some law school schmuck , i never saw a bad guy before ?
you are gonna wave that thing at the wrong guy ... ... he' s gonna take it from you and bury it up your ass , guaranteed .
now give me the gun .
come on .
i know you love me , kid , but you gotta lighten up .
listen ... ... i' m throwin ' a big party out at my summer house saturday .
i want you to come .
something i wanna talk to you about .
why can' t you talk to me about it here ?
i' il tell you saturday .
i need visual aids .
what' s the matter with you , pushing this guy in the pool ... ... your fucking friends knocking down my rented tables ?
what you doing out here by yourself ?
sittin ' .
you sure are weird , baby .
how come you never try to fuck me ?
you got into a big beef for me , and you ain' t never laid a glove on me .
you' re dave' s girl now .
he can' t fuck me , all the coke he' s doin ' .
what are you two talking about ?
fucking .
speaking of fucking , look at those fucking friends of yours .
they' re a fucking embarrassment .

be a hostess .
fuck you , asshole !
yeah , fuck me .
your fuckin ' chick' s giving you a hand job in front of everybody !
i got guests here , for christ' s sake !
people are eating !
take it easy , dave !
you take it easy !
got any manners ?
you wanna fuck her , fuck like a normal human being !
take her to the bedroom !
people !
okay , dave , what' s up ?
i need you to do something for me .
what is it ?
you gotta help me spring tony taglialucci from the prison barge at rikers .
are you crazy ?
he thinks i stole a million dollars from him .
this is a dying man .
he' s nuts .
he' s totally fucking paranoid .
do you realize what you just said to me ?
if i don' t do it , he' s going to have me killed .
it' s that simple .
so that means you' re gonna have to bust into prison ?
what do you think , i' m crazy ?
he' s gonna swim off the island .
gonna swim ?
yeah .
he' s gonna drown .
not if you and i pick him up ... ... in that .
tony' s got a guy on the inside who' il get him in the water .
i know these channels like the back of my hand .
we cross little neck bay into the north corner to pick him up .
there' s a buoy about 100 yards offshore .
that' s where he' s gonna be .
this is in and out , half hour tops .
he' s gonna jump off a barge ... ... swim 100 yards ... ... to a buoy in the east river ?
impossible .
it' s too rough .
he' s going to die .
that' s his fucking problem .
there' s no point in arguing .
i have to do this .
i' m asking for your help .
you' re a lawyer , man .
what the fuck is happenin ' to you ?
i don' t know .
i am so fucking shook up , i cannot see straight .
i' m in an impossible fucking situation here .
once i get tony on the shore ... ... there is a distinct possibility that he and his goombah son ... ... have got some plans for me .
what do you mean , " plans " ?
what kind of plans ?
how do i know he' s not gonna kill me ?
this guy hates my guts .
i' m in trouble .
i am in fuckin ' trouble here .
you are the only fucking person on earth ... ... that i can trust .
and i' il give you $50, 000 to go along .
if i go along , it ain' t for the money .
are you in ?
when is this ...
i don' t know !
his son' s gonna call me .
are you in ?
all right , i' m in .
thank you .
surprise .
i was asleep .
can i come in ?
i bought you some cheesecake .
i don' t like cheesecake .
you wouldn' t have buzzed me up , if you wasn' t gonna let me in .
i' m saying no , charlie .
what can i do ?
what are you gonna do ?
are you gonna ... ... bust the chain ?
chase me around the apartment ?
get me naked ?
take me on the floor ?
i' m too old for that .
that' s too bad .
if you can' t get in ... ... you don' t get in .
where' s my cheesecake ?
can i ask you a personal question ?
anything .
did you ever kill anybody ?
i' m sorry .
well , it' s just not a simple question .
i just can' t answer it like ...
that' s all right .
you don' t have to ... ... there it is .
you don' t have to answer .
when i was a kid in east harlem ... ... the wops said ... ... no spics could go east of park avenue .
no ' ricans west of fifth avenue .
that don' t leave you much room to maneuver .
say you want to go to central park , play with the ducks .
you' re shit outta luck .
so what do you do ?
you go anyway .
i' m up on 106th street , central park , near the lake .
i get caught by these copiens .
right ?
they surround me .
so i get my blood up , pull out my blade .
come on !
i' il take any one of you mothers !
no , man .
we' re gonna kill your ass . " out come the zip guns .
homemade gun .
you pull the hook back , catch that bullet square , ping .
hit you in the head , man , you got serious problems .
that was the last chase on me like that ... ... because from then on i carried my own piece .
guys went down , yeah , but it ain' t like , you know , you just ... ... decide one day , and then that' s it .
no .
you just do what you gotta do to survive .
somehow , you know , you just end up where you are .
that' s how everybody ends up where they are .
everybody .
only i' m gettin ' out .
i' m gonna rent cars .
what' re you laughing at ?
everybody laughs at that .
that' s a dream .
i know , i' m sorry .
didn' t you ever have a dream ?
of course i did .
the diamond room isn' t exactly the end of my rainbow , you know .
it' s just ...
i don' t know .
just sometimes i hear myself talk ...
... about new agents and auditions , and i' m trying to be so optimistic .
then i think ... ... why should i be so optimistic ?
yeah , i had a dream ... ... but now i' m awake ...
... and i hate my dream .
maybe it' s time i started thinking about doing something else .
maybe someplace else too .
seems like every day i' m finding something new i like about gail .
i keep workin ' my points about us gettin ' out of new york ... ... going to live in the bahamas together , permanent .
she ain' t sayin ' much , but ... ... i can tell the idea is growin ' on her .
money' s comin ' in steady now .
it won' t be much longer till i got what i need .
this dream of mine , it' s so close ... ... i can touch it .
where you going ?
wait , no .
i' m tired .
i' m an old man .
i need a rockin ' chair .
come on !
please !
let me watch you .
i love to watch you .
go ahead .
there it is .
i' m sorry !
look at that !
here' s a bunch of us at the copa .
everybody dancin ' , drinkin ' dom perignon .
everything paid for by kleinfeld .
won' t even let you put your hand in your pocket .
always sneakin ' off , payin ' the waiter .
but he has that bad drinker face .
his eyes are gettin ' beadier and beadier these days .
should have seen it coming .
don' t stop .
please don' t stop .
look at that move .
you' re gonna let this fuckin ' goombah paw your woman like that ?
they' re just dancin ' .
don' t you appreciate that , the movement , the rhythm ?
what i don' t appreciate , he' s got his fucking hands all over her ass .
he don' t have his hands over her ass .
i believe those are her hips .
look at the shithead .
these wise guys think they' re so hard assed .
i am so sick of hoods like that ... ... coming into my office , my office ... ... thinkin ' they can push me around .
you should tell him what you think .
why hold somethin ' like that inside ?
why not get something like that off your chest ?
it' s a terrible thing to carry around .
i will .
i think you should .
i will .
see how interested he' s gonna be in your comments .
what' re you doin ' ?
are you outta your mind ?
what' s that ?
yeah , you , wop .

just drop it .
just tryin ' to cover all the bases .
it' s comin ' up , you know .
you two going somewhere ?

just a little boat ride .
why don' t you just let it go ?
it' s dull what you' re doin ' .
what' s the problem ?
it' s just fuckin ' dull .
i' m just askin ' a simple question .
what' s the matter ?
you' re actin ' like an asshole .
if a guy' s goin ' on a boat , you wanna know if he gets seasick .
it could be important .
what boat ?
what boat are you talking about ?
what boat , charlie ?
if you ever talk that shit again in front of her , i' m gonna kill you .
what' s the matter with him ?
i don' t like him .
didn' t like him the minute i met him .
you' re just not listenin ' to me .
all right .
so what is this boat thing then ?
what is that asshole manipulating you into ?
tell me .
just helpin ' him out with something , that' s all .
i owe him .
you owe him ?
he' s a fucking cokehead !
i can' t believe you hang around with that guy .
he' s sick .
he' s gonna get you killed , or sent back to prison .
he saved my life !
so now you have to pay him with it ?
jesus christ , charlie , you give me this whole song and dance ... ... about how you' re out of that shit , but you' re not .
song and dance ?
what does that mean , " song and dance " ?
you' re not .
where' d you get that ?

why' d you make me believe all the crap about bahamas and paradise ?
i feel ridiculous !
' cause you haven' t changed !
you haven' t changed a bit !
what the fuck are you tryin ' to tell me ?
that my gettin ' out is just some bullshit fantasy trip i' m layin ' on you ?
is that what you' re sayin ' ?
how could you say that ?
how can you say that when you know how close i am ?
how could you say those words to me ?
i gotta do this , just this one thing , and then i' m out .
i owe dave .
you don' t owe him shit !
you think you do .
that' s the problem .
that' s why nobody like you gets out .
you' re not listening .
everything you learned in the neighborhood ... ... won' t do anything but get you killed !
how do you know what i learned in my neighborhood ?
this is stupid what you say .
i know how this dream ends .
it isn' t in paradise .
it ends with me carrying you into sutton emergency room ... ... at 3 : 00 a . m .
and standing there ... ... crying like an idiot ... ... while your shoes fill with blood and you die .
you won' t listen to me ...
' cause you' re bullshitting me !
you' re not listening to me !
dave is my friend .

point of no return .
dave crossed it .
i' m here with him .
that means i' m goin ' along for the ride , the whole ride ... ... all the way to the end of the line , wherever that is .
i had to do it .
he never would' ve let me live .
i know , you' re pissed .
i' m gonna throw in another $10, 000 .
i' m gonna send over the whole $60, 000 in cash tomorrow .
all right ?
it' s gonna look like the kid tried to spring the old man , boat flipped , they drowned .
maybe they got their heads split by a scow or barge just for good measure .
this is never gonna come back to us .
trust me .
you ripped him off , didn' t you ?
who ?
tony t. you did take the million dollars , didn' t you ?
yeah .
you ain' t a lawyer no more , dave .

most people will .
you get old enough ... ... you remember a reason why everybody wants to whack you .
you believe ' em all ... ... but you know somebody' s gotta be lyin ' .
or maybe they' re all lyin ' .
when you can' t see the angles no more , you' re in trouble , baby .
you' re in trouble .
there' s a patrolman williams on the line .

mr. kleinfeld ?
this is patrolman williams .
we' re down here at your garage .
your license plate is dk 777 ?
yeah .
is there a problem ?
somebody tried to steal your mercedes .
there was an accident .
there was an accident ?
yeah .
is it badly damaged ?
i' m afraid so .
i' il be right down .
i' il be ten minutes .
come on .
mr. taglialucci says to hold that for him !
wait up .
i can' t talk .
i have an appointment .
you were right about kleinfeld .
he' s a bad guy .
me and him are finished .
i can' t talk .
i' il call you , okay ?

what is it ?
am i on the outs with you ?
is that it ?
yeah .

i just wanted you to know you were right about kleinfeld .
i' m sorry if you' re upset .

i' m not gonna have a kid who' s not gonna have a father .
we gotta talk about this .
mr. brigante , my name is duncan .
oh , my god .
i' m here to escort you to mr. norwalk in the district attorney' s office .
i got nothin ' to say to him unless i' m under arrest .
mr. norwalk has a tape he' d like to play for you .
unless i' m under arrest , i ain' t goin ' anywhere , especially without my lawyer .
mr. kleinfeld took a knife in the chest at 2 : 00 this afternoon .
i advise you to come with us .
we may be the only friends you' ve got .
i' m going , too .
kleinfeld' s lucky to be alive .
we' re holding him at east side hospital .
we want his ass healthy when we send it upstate .
you' re sendin ' him upstate ?
what for ?
david kleinfeld became a very big fish while you were gone .
even bigger than you .
he' s dirty .
money laundering , jury tampering , bribery .
we' ve been after him for some time now .
i don' t know nothin ' about that , so ...
there' s a lot you don' t know .
bill , you got no case here .
you know it and i know it .
chances are , you won' t even get an indictment .
wanna try your luck ?
look , let' s not both waste our time .
you said maybe i could help myself .
you' re not taping this , are you ?
gimme a little credit .
all right .
i thought of something you might want .
you get off me , i' il help you put carlito brigante back inside .
brigante ?
for what ?
after he got out , he started coming to my office and making a lot of phone calls .
i found out he was back with rolando rivas , his old partner , dealin ' coke .
and i' m talkin ' serious numbers .
would you testify to that ?
absolutely .
we don' t believe him .
word on the street is you' ve been clean since you came out of prison .
kleinfeld' s the one we' re after .
he was right .
i' d never get an indictment with what i had .
but now , with your help ... ... we can put this filth away for a long time .
hermano ... ... we know about tony t.
who' s tony t. ?
yeah , right .
his body popped up in the east river yesterday , and his kid , frankie' s .
somebody was trying to bust tony outta prison .
i don' t know these people you mentioned .
i don' t know them .
tony t. had another son besides frankie , vincent .
seems vincent went crazy after those bodies popped up .
let it out all over the street that kleinfeld set up that prison break ... ... then killed his father and his brother .
we aren' t saying you were on that boat too .
but knowing your relationship with kleinfeld , that' s a good possibility .
don' t you think , hermano ?
i don' t like boats .
all right , here' s the deal .
if you were on that boat , and i know goddamn well you were ... ... testify against kleinfeld for first degree murder .
you' il receive complete immunity and a couple airline tickets to the bahamas .
you wanna get even with kleinfeld ?
here it is on a silver platter .
i would love to help you , but i can' t .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
i don' t know these people .
i don' t know what you' re sayin ' ...
let me tell you somethin ' , mr. convicted dope peddler ... ... if we can guess you were on that boat , how long before the italians do , too ?
what if they get to kleinfeld ?
they can twist his arm .
you think he won' t give you up ?
think again !
you don' t owe kleinfeld nothing .
the shyster tried to set you up .
bury you , jack .
that it ?
i wanna hear from you by noon tomorrow .
you think you' re gonna sail off into the sunset , asshole ?
think again .
you gotta do it .
they' re giving you no choice .
you want out , go ahead .
you can turn around , walk away , never look back .
i would understand .
but i got a plan .
i got a way outta this .
pull over here , please .
what' s going on ?
just wait five minutes .
where are you going ?
wait here five minutes .
what is that ?
tickets on an overnight train to miami .
nobody' s gonna look for us on the train .
we hit miami , we catch a plane to nassau .
what about the club ?
your money ?
fuck the club .
i already got $70, 000 in a safe .
my friend in the islands can float us the rest .
let' s do it .
let' s get outta here .
all three of us .
we' re runnin ' out of time , babe .
the dream don' t come no closer by itself .
we gotta run after it now .
i know , it' s not the way i planned it either , but it is how it is .
i' m gonna go to the club , get my money , and i' m goin ' straight to grand central .
train leaves 11 : 30 for miami .
you' re gonna be there , gail ?
you' il be there ?
i' il be there .
i love you .
just make sure you' re there .
i' il see you later .
train leaves in five hours , and i' m angling like crazy in my head .
norwalk' il blow over .
he won' t come out of the country if he can' t bust me here .
but he ain' t my only problem .
five hours left .
can i think of everything ?
cover everybody .
tie all the shoelaces .
gotta listen to my instincts ... ... like the one tellin ' me that face and that uniform don' t go together .
just one last piece of business .
gotta look in kleinfeld' s eyes .
gotta know for sure .
who are you ?
kleinfeld is my lawyer .
hands on the wall .
go ahead .
relax .
it' s your pal .
scared the hell out of me .
cop' s not supposed to let anybody in .
it' s you , it' s okay , but ...
cops ain' t gonna protect you .
the mob is looking for you .
i know .
where the fuck have you been ?
what do you got here ?
where you been ?
how do you feel ?
i' m not feeling very well .
where the fuck have you been ?
i' ve been to norwalk' s office .

fuck you !
what the fuck are you doing ?
would you fuckin ' put that away ?

did it ?
no , i did .

no , it didn' t .
i did .
so fuck you , fuck the street .
your whole goddamn world' s this big ... ... and there' s only one rule : you save your own ass .
save your own ass .
save your own ass .
