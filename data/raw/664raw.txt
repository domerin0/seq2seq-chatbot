those were the years after the ice caps had melted ... because of the greenhouse gases , and the oceans had risen to drown so many cities ... along all the shorelines of the world .
amsterdam , venice , new york forever lost .
millions of people were displaced .
climates became chaotic .
hundreds of millions of people starved in poorer countries .
elsewhere , a high degree of prosperity survived ... when most governments in the developed world ... introduced legal sanctions to strictly license pregnancies , which was why robots , who are never hungry and who did not consume resources ... beyond those of their first manufacture , were so essential an economic link ... in the chain mail of society .
to create an artificial being has been the dream of man ... since the birth of science .
not merely the beginning of the modern age ... when our forbearers astonished the world with the first thinking machines primitive monsters that could play chess .
how far we have come .
the artificial being is a reality ... of perfect simulacrum ... articulated in limb , articulate in speech ... and not lacking in human response .
and even pain memory response .
how did that make you feel ?
angry ?
shocked ?
i don' t understand .
what did i do to your feelings ?
you did it to my hand .
all right .
there' s the rub .
undress .
at cybertronics of new jersey , the artificial being has reached its highest form .
the universally adopted mecha the basis for hundreds of models serving the human race ... in all the multiplicity of daily life .
that' s far enough .
but we have no reason to congratulate ourselves .
we are rightly proud of it , but what does it amount to ?
sheila , open .
a sensory toy ... with intelligent behavioral circuits ... using neurone sequencing technology ... as old as i am .
i believe that my work on mapping the impulse pathways in a single neurone ... can enable us to construct ... a mecha of a qualitatively different order .
i propose ... that we build a robot ... who can love .
love ?
but we ship thousands of lover models every month .
of course .
you' re your own best customer , syatyoo sama .
quality control is very important .
tell me .
what is love ?
love is first widening my eyes a little bit ... and quickening my breathing a little ... and warming my skin and touching my
and so on .
exactly so .
thank you , sheila .
but i wasn' t referring to sensuality simulators .
the word that i used was ``love .
love like the love of a child for its parents .
i propose that we build a robot child who can love .
a robot child who will genuinely love ... the parent or parents it imprints on ... with a love that will never end .
a child substitute mecha ?
but a mecha with a mind , with neuronal feedback .
you see , what i' m suggesting is that love will be the key ... by which they acquire a kind of subconscious never before achieved .
an inner world of metaphor , of intuition , of self motivated reasoning ,
of dreams .
a robot that dreams ?
yes .
how exactly do we pull this off ?
you know , it occurs to me ... with all this animus existing against mechas today , it isn' t simply a question of creating a robot who can love .
but isn' t the real conundrum , can you get a human to love them back ?
ours will be a perfect child caught in a freeze frame ... always loving , never ill , never changing .
with all the childless couples yearning in vain for a license , our little mecha will not only open up a completely new market , but it will fill a great human need .
but you haven' t answered my question .
if a robot could genuinely love a person , what responsibility does that person hold toward that mecha in return ?
it' s a moral question , isn' t it ?
the oldest one of all .
but in the beginning , didn' t god create adam to love him ?

``the baby was born as the first leaves of autumn fell . ``a baby boy .
and marian' s wish came true . ``the boy had white hair .
he was baptized martin , after his grandfather .
dr. frazier .
hi .
good to see you .
hello , henry .
listen , there was an article by random bach in the journal of chinese medicine .
they talked about these virus locators , hello again , monica . microscopic synthetic hunter killers .
did you read that article ?
i can still hear you .
i' m worried about her , henry .
she' s really got me worried .
yeah , i know .
she' s in the most difficult position of feeling ... she should mourn the death of your son .
after five years , your instincts tell you to mourn him too .
but medicine assures us that mourning is inappropriate
that martin is merely pending .
pending .
so all her grief goes undigested .
henry , your son may be beyond our science , but it' s your wife who can still be reached .
the screening process was extremely difficult .
it was almost tougher than building the prototype .
of our 2, 000 employees , a surprising few ... met your minimum requirements for the in house testing .
initiate .
employment record , quality of lifestyle
query , internal data
loyalty to the firm , and in this individual' s case , a family tragedy that may qualify him above the rest .
i' il see him .
henry don' t kill me .
henry , what are you doing ?
i love you .
don' t kill me .
the door' s closed .
i like your floor .
i can' t accept this
there is no substitute for your own child
you don' t have to accept it or even try .
it' s not too late to take him back .
what were you thinking ?
shh .
i' il do whatever you want me to do .
do you think i can just
i can just  i' il do whatever you want me to do
i don' t know what to do .
i know , i know .
i' il return him to cybertronics first thing in the morning .
it' s gone .
good .
i mean , henry , did you see his face ?
he' s [ sighs ]
he' s so real .
but he' s not .
no , he' s not .
i mean , inside he' s like all the rest , isn' t he ?
a hundred miles of fiber , yeah .
but outside , he just looks so real
like he is a child .
a mecha child .
a child .
the show of faith my company has placed on me , on us , is extraordinary .
now , there are a few simple procedures we need to follow ... if and when you decide to keep david .
if you decide to keep him , there' s an imprinting protocol ... consisting of a code string of seven particularwords ... which need to be spoken to david in the predefined order that' s been printed here .
now , monica , for our own protection , this imprinting is irreversible .
the robot child' s love would be sealed in a sense , hardwired and would be part of him forever .
because of this , after imprinting , no mecha child can be resold .
if an adopted parent should ever decide not to keep the child , they must return it to cybertronics for destruction .
i had to sign a letter of agreement , or they wouldn' t even let you see david .
you have to sign it too .
right here .
monica , don' t imprint until you' re entirely sure .
silly man .
of course i' m not sure .
would you like me to sleep now ?
good idea .
good idea .
um
monica ?
uh , well , it' s late , you know .
it' s after 900 , so  yeah .
ten past .
how how late do they let you stay up ?
i can never go to sleep .
but i can lay quietly and not make a peep .
so , those pajamas will fit you , and we' il be in to check on you first thing in the morning .
dress me ?
you know , i' m gonna say good night while you boys be boys .
raise your arms .
is it a game ?
yes .
hide and seek .
i found you .
i found you .
out out get out of here
and close the goddamn door
is it a game ?
now , i' m gonna read some words .
and , uh , they won' t make any sense , and look at me all the time .
can you do that ?
yes , monica .
can you feel my hand on the back of your neck ?
yes .
does any of this hurt ?
no .
okay , now , look at me .
ready ?
cirrus .
socrates .
particle .
decibel .
hurricane .
dolphin .
tulip .
monica .
david .
monica .
all right .
i wonder if i did that right .
i don' t
what were those words for , mommy ?
what did you call me ?
mommy .
who am i , david ?
you are my mommy .
# [ humming ]
mmm .
you smell lovely .
i love it when you wear this stuff .
will you still love me when it' s all gone ?
no .
stop it .
but we can get married again ... and begin with a fragrance that' s not in such short supply .
we gotta go .
come on .
we' re late .
hello , david .
hello , henry .
walk us out , all right , sweet heart ?
come on .

henry , your tie !
i know , i know .
you' re hopeless !
he' s trying so hard to please you .
he has a way with my coffee .
and it' s creepy .
you can never hear him coming .
he' s just always there .
he is only a child .
monica , he' s a toy .
he' s a gift ... from you .
david , when we leave , all the doors and windows will go smart .
so you can' t leave your room .
but if you' d like
oh , i put way too much on .
do i smell lovely ?
oh , god , no .
mommy , will you die ?
well , one day , david , yes , i will .
i' il be alone .
don' t worry yourself so .
how long will you live ?
for ages .
for 50 years .
i love you , mommy .
i hope you never die .
never .
yes .
darling !
we' re becoming unfashionably , unreasonably late .
hello ?
this belonged to martin , my son .
ahh !
his name is teddy .
teddy , this is david .
hello , teddy .
hello , david .
david , teddy is a super toy , and i know you will take good care of each other .
i am not a toy .
henry ?
sorry .
what were you doing up there ?
i' il tell you in the car .
come on .
is 50 years a long time ?
i don' t think so .
david , i' il get it !
honey , hand it to me .
look what i can do .
hello ?
yes ?
mrs. swinton , could you hold a moment ?
i have an urgent call from your husband .
yes , i will .

are they torturing you , teddy ?
he used to be a super toy , but now he' s old and stupid .
you want him ?
yes , please .
so i guess now you' re the new super toy .
so , what good stuff can you do ?
oh , can you do power stuff , like walk on the ceiling or the walls ?
anti gravity ?
like , float or fly ?
can you ?
no , because i' m real .
can you break this ?
i better not .
these things , they do look better in pieces .
they do .
i can' t .
stand up .
look , they made you bigger than me .
who did ?
well , they did the doll makers .
they made you taller .
why don' t you look like one ? ``like one " ?
you' re not cute like a doll .
you just look like someone' s ordinary kid .
when' s your birthday ?
i never had a birthday .
okay .
when were you first built ?
when' s your ``build day " ?
i don' t remember .
okay , what' s the first thing you can remember ?
a bird .
what sort of bird ?
a bird with big wings ... and feathers sticking up from the bottom .
can you draw it ?
yes .
that looks like a peacock .
can you say ``peacock " ?
peacock .
can you say ``pee " ?
pee .
now say that two times fast .
okay .
then you gotta put the green ones
read to us ?
hey .
let' s see .
oh , yeah .
david' s going to love it .
``as soon as his show was over , the showman went into the kitchen , ``where the whole sheep which he was preparing for supper ... ``was roasting on the slowly turning spit in the furnace . ``when he saw there was not enough wood to finish roasting it , ``he called harlequin and the punchinello and said , ``bring me in pinocchio .
you will find him hanging on a nail . ``he is made of nice , dry wood , ``and i' m sure he will make a nice fire for my roast . ' ``pinocchio worked until midnight . `and instead of making eight baskets , ``he made sixteen . ``then he went to bed and fell asleep . ``as he slept , he dreamt he saw the fairy , lovely and smiling , ``who gave him a kiss , saying , ``brave pinocchio , ``in return for your good heart , i forgive all your past misdeeds . ``be good in future , and you will be happy . ``then the dream ended and pinocchio awoke , ``full of amazement . ``you can imagine how astonished he was ... ``when he saw that he was no longer a puppet ... but a real boy just like other boys .
josephine evidently has taken a leave of absence .
oh , my god .
mm hmm .
well , i saw that coming .
how could you see that coming ?
they were fabulous together .
oh , come on !
she was miserable !
i mean
well , he never said they were miserable .
yeah , that' s because
wasn' t that because of the cutbacks ?
i have no idea .
actually , they don' t tell me anything .
do they really have a weight problem ?
so do i.
you do not .
that is ridiculous .
all right , look .
i don' t know .
there' s something about inner beauty that
you will break .
oh , that is ridiculous !
exactly .
work has become so silly .
i know what you' re talking about .
does he eat ?
i' m not sure .
you' re not supposed to do that .
david , what are you doing ?
david !
martin , put the fork down .
is it in the manual book ?
stop .
stop , david .
put it down now .
david , stop it !
martin , you' re provoking him , okay ?
stop it .
stop it , david !
the two of you , stop it !
stop it !
stop it now !
stop it !
david , stop it !
there' s sputum in the code lockers .
smell that garlic .
we should throw in a chest mint .
can you locate the service ?
don' t touch the merchandise .
it' s all swamp in here .
you made a mess of yourself .
spinach is for rabbits , people and popeye , not robo boys .
try to insert yourself .
now through the pantry , all the lower shelves .
it' s okay , mommy .
it doesn' t hurt .
the activators are all shut down on the left side .
monica .
shh .
i have to
i have to
that' s not all of it .
that' s not all of it .
if you do something really , really , really special for me , a special mission , then i' il go tell mommy ...
i love you .
and then she' il love you too .
what shall i do ?
you have to promise , and then i' il tell you .
you have to tell me , and then i' il promise .
i want a lock of mommy' s hair .
i' il share it with you .
and if you had it and wore it , she might love you even more .
like the princess in the movie we saw .
when she had the prince' s hair in her necklace thing , he loved her .
we can ask her .
no , it has to be a secret mission .
sneak into mommy' s bedroom in the middle of the night ... and chop it off .
i can' t , martin .
i' m not allowed .
you promised .
you said , ``tell me , and then i' il promise .
didn' t you ?
david !
why did you do that ?
why did you do that ?
what are you doing ?
you' re hurting him !
talk to me !
goddamn it !
why did you do that ?
why did you do that ?
you' re hurting him !
you' re hurting him !
don' t break him !
why did you do that ?
henry , i wanted mommy to love me ... more .
oh , my god .
what ?
i think i cut my eye .
oh , god , i think it' s bleeding .
let me see .
it' s normal for little boys to feel jealous and competitive .
martin' s only been home a month , and it' s normal for brothers to challenge each other .
he was playing a game , he made a mistake , and
he' s practically human .
that' s not how he looked holding the knife .
scissors .
it was a weapon .
why do you keep imagining that he was purposely trying to harm me ?
because we don' t know the answer to that .
how is he worth the risk to you or to martin or to us as a family ?
i will not let you take him back .
you told me what would happen ...
if we ever took him back .
think about this .
if he was created to love , then it' s reasonable to assume he knows how to hate .
and if pushed to those extremes , what is he really capable of ?
happy birthday , martin .
i made this for you .
this him ?
is this your little brother ?
technically , no .
he' s mecha .
what' s mecha ?
we' re organic , you' re mechanical .
orga , mecha .
orga , mecha .
orga , mecha .
todd , stop !
i didn' t know they even made little kids .
can you pee ?
i cannot .
then let' s see what you can' t pee with .
come on .
touch it .
it feels so real .
oh , that' s that' s creepy .
wow .
it feels so real .
that is too real .
mecha real .
does he have das ?
das what ?
das istgut !
damage avoidance system .
das .
it' s a pain alert system .
our serving man has it .
it' s so they don' t go picking up fire with their bare hands and stuff .
watch .
watch this .
now , i' m not gonna cut you .
this isn' t gonna hurt .
i' m not gonna cut your skin .
just tell me when you feel it .
keep me safe , martin .
keep me safe .
let me go !
keep me safe , martin .
keep me safe .
keep me safe .
let me go !
mom !
mom !
mom !
keep me safe .
keep me safe .
keep me safe .
keep me safe .
henry !
oh , my oh , my god !
oh , my god !
he' s not breathing !
he' s not breathing !
come on , martin !
come on !
take a breath .
take a breath .
cough it up .
that a boy .
that' s a great boy .
oh , my god .
thank god .
hey , david ?
mommy !
mommy .
i i need to speak to you for a minute , okay ?
okay .
these are beautiful .
thank you .
um [ sniffes ]
um , hey , david , i was thinking that ... we could go for a drive tomorrow in the country .
you and me .
what do you say ?
and teddy ?
yeah , and teddy .
thank you , mommy .
thank you so much .
tomorrow is gonna be just for us , okay ?
where are we going ?
some place nice ?
are those happy tears ?
what' s for dinner tonight ?
you know you don' t eat .
yes .
but i like sitting at the table .
david ?
david , come on .
david david
listen listen to me !
david ?
david , listen .
now ... you won' t understand the reasons , but ...
i have i have to leave you here .
is it a game ?
no .
when will you come back for me ?
i' m not , david .
you' il have to be here by yourself .
alone ?
with teddy .
no .
no , no , no , no , no , no !
no , mommy , please !
no , no !
please , no , mommy !
shh , shh , shh .
they will destroy you .
no !
no , mommy !
i' m sorry i broke myself .
i' m so sorry i cut your hair off ...
and i' m sorry i hurt you and i hurt martin .
i have to go !
i have to go !
stop it !
stop it !
i have to go now !
mommy , no !
mommy !
mommy , if pinocchio became a real boy ... and i become a real boy , can i come home ?
that' s just a story .
but a story tells what happens .
stories are not real !
you' re not real !
now , listen to me .
look .
look !
take this , all right ?
take this .
don' t let anyone see how much it is .
now , look , don' t go that way .
look !
look at me !
look !
don' t go that way , all right ?
go anywhere but that way or they' il catch you .
don' t ever let them catch you !
listen , stay away from flesh fairs , away from where there are lots of people .
stay away from all people .
only others like you .
only mecha are safe .
i gotta go .
why do you wanna leave me ?
why do you wanna leave me ?
i' m sorry i' m not real .
if you let me , i' il be so real for you .
let go .
let go , david .
let go !
i' m sorry i didn' t tell you about the world .
i' m afraid .
of me ?
yes .
that i will hurt you ?
yes .
i think ... you' re afraid of letting go .
i think you' re afraid of happiness .
and this is starting to excite me .
are you afraid of seeing the stars ,
patricia ?
i can show you how to reach them .
i' m afraid of what you' ve got under there .
may i see what it looks like first ?
is this your first time ... with something like me ?
i' ve never been with mecha .
that makes two of us .
i' m afraid it will hurt .
patricia , once you' ve had a lover robot , you' il never want a real man ... again .
are these the wounds of passion ?

no expiration date , no i. d.

sir , it' s a late generation lover mecha .
well , there' s a relief from all this antique iron .
you are certain he' s not a man ?
i wouldn' t want a repeat of the trenton incident .
