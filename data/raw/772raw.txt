she hated you .
i should' ve picked up on that .
she hated all thieves .
no wonder you fought .
excuse me ?
may i have my phone back ?
no .
that' s a nice pull , by the way .
thanks .
did you get that tingling sensation down your spine when you did it ?
or is that none of my business ?
you considered a career change ?
have you ?
i tried hotels .
i' m better at this .
went by the caf for some tiramisu .
it wasn' t the same .
who' s the night fox ?
they did something to the eggs .
why accept his challenge ?
because he' il lose .
and how can you beat him ?
we can' t .
you' re not making any sense .
okay .
the bulgari job you pulled with frank when we were together ... ... i knew it was you .
why didn' t you say something ?
why didn' t you ... ... robert ?
i didn' t want it to end .
you assumed it would .
was i wrong ?
you shouldn' t be here .
i have a meeting .
someone stole a whole bunch of paintings in lake como .
interesting .
any leads ?
the next time i see you ... ... l' m arresting you .
and ocean and anybody else i recognize .
fair enough .
ready ?
right .
yes , of course i do .
my blue dancers , my degas .
they took it , unfortunately , and i really would like ...
do you have any enemies ?
anybody out there who would feel wronged by you ?
no .
i can' t see anyone .
but why ?
you think ...
you think maybe the thief ... ... is trying to harm me personally now ?
well , i assumed he was after the paintings themselves .
i think it' s enough .
ready ?
good ?
i have something you might be interested in .
it' s a dvd with all the hidden surveillance cameras i have to my place .
it' s plenty .
i haven' t checked it out yet .
maybe the thieves have been careless enough to be photographed .
i doubt it , this level of thief , but i' il take a look .
yeah .
you never know .
okay .
well , merci .
thank you , mademoiselle lahiri , for everything .
thank you .
goodbye .
goodbye .
mademoiselle lahiri .

livingston dell , male , caucasian , 5' 6 " , 150 pounds .
virgil malloy , male , caucasian , 5 ' 10 " , 160 pounds .
robert ryan , male , caucasian ...
hello ?
buon giorno , mr. eisenhower .
this is your 5 a . m .
wake up call .
really ?
yes , i' m afraid .
have a nice day , sir .
hey .
what are you doing ?
what ... ?
sleeping .
why are you dressed ?
it' s 5 : 30 , day of .
we gotta go .
let' s go .
it' s 11 : 30 .
the night before .
but ...
oh , he' s mean .
he' s just mean spirited .
how many espressos did you have ?
five .
yeah , come on .
i don' t know if she' s just confused ... ... or she' s really turned the corner and hates me now .
you think i handled this wrong ?
i was too forceful .
i was too american .
she' s different .
maybe you' re right , maybe she has moved on .
you know , i talked to a doctor about getting that tattoo removed .
but given its location , he advised against it .
that guy doing potsie is unbelievable .
i mean , what' s this guy' s problem ?
he' s stitched us up twice in two weeks , all over his ego .
it' s the first decent evening we' ve had together in i don' t know how long .
all right , all right , let' s just stay on point here .
let' s go over the list again .
who died and made you danny ?
no one .
i' m sorry .
my emotions are all over the place .
i was forceful , trying to show good leadership ...
for fuck' s sake .
let' s go .
you' re a good leader .
thanks .
all right , well , let' s go over the list again .
swinging priest ?
not enough people .
crazy larry ?
not enough people .
soft shoulder ?
not enough people .
baker' s dozen ?
no woman and not enough people .
hell in a handbasket ?
we can' t train a cat that quickly .
and not enough people .
what about tess ?
what about her ?
well , you know how she kind of looks like ...
so what ?
yeah , what' s your point ?
so we do a lookie loo .
it' s a lookie loo with a bundle of joy .
a lookie loo with tess ... ... and a bundle of joy ?
you' ve gone right out of your tree , my son .
he' s mad .
it' s crazy .
it' s italian television crazy , and we' re still one short .
no , think about it .
she can get near the egg during daylight with half the system down .
i mean , that' s a trifecta .
he might be right .
make the calls .
linus caldwell , you are not following the procedures ... ... danny talked about if terry benedict shows up .
something is wrong .
what is wrong ?
danny' s fine .
he' s with rusty .
during this part of the plan , they can' t communicate with us .
promise he isn' t hurt .
i promise he isn' t hurt .
you' re gonna miss the deadline .
danny would be thrilled if you met him in rome when the job' s finished .
he misses you like crazy .
plus , you studied art , so i know how much you love rome .
there' s no downside here .
wow , they' re bringing you along fast , aren' t they ?
yes .
danny would be more thrilled ... ... if you were on the 7 p . m .
out of jfk , which means you have to leave right now .
i thought i' d requested a midsize .
danny here ?
he wanted to be .
did you have a nice flight ?
we weren' t sure if you were a window or aisle person .
how long' s danny been in jail ?
just a couple of days , really .
which , you know , on the bright side , he' s completely safe from benedict .
he told me everything was fine .
he lied right to me .
what i think he meant by " fine " is we' re running low on time and money ... ... and we' re deeper in debt than when we started .
i assume that you have a plan to get him out .
actually , she sounds like her .
no , she needs a southern accent .
can you do a southern ... ?
what the hell is going on with you guys ?
not quite .
the accent is crucial .
it' s the first thing people notice .
this ridiculous car , what is it doing ?
okay , i' m sorry .
all right , i' m just gonna level with you .
due to certain personnel losses ... ... that we have sustained ... ... we' re ... various readjustments had to be made .
you' re gonna have to play a small role in this thing .
okay ?
so can you put these on ?
i' d like you to put this hat on .
you' re gonna put on that , and you' re gonna stuff it with that .
and we' il turn around , just give you a little moment .
small role .
who am i supposed to be ?
well ...
oh , really ?
well , absolutely .
i can have ... we can make the suite available .
no , no , no trouble at all .
i mean , we would love ... we are honored that she would think of us again .
okay .
okay .
thank you .
bye .
how is this going to get danny out ?
we needed someone famous .
why didn' t you get someone famous ?
just think four weddings and a funeral .
she wasn' t in four weddings and a funeral .
i. " " i wasn' t in four weddings and a funeral .
just protect your fake baby .
i' m hyperventilating .
welcome back , signora roberts .
thank you .
she' s very tired .
take it .
take it .
okay .
oh , let' s hide .
let' s hide .
julia ?
my name is teresa .
i thought i saw a friend of mine , someone that i know .
no , absolutely not .
you can' t turn off the pressure sensors .
no .
well , she can' t touch it .
she' s a movie star .
she' s not the pope , for chrissake .
you' re from smyrna , georgia .
you were born in 1967 .
you like croquet and knitting .
your middle name is fiona .
you' ve got 10 dogs , seven horses .
your favorite color is peach .
she doesn' t have more horses than dogs .
i can' t do this .
i can' t .
tess , we' re out of time .
" julia , " please .
julia .
no , we understand you' re feeling insecure .
that is totally natural .
you' re playing an actress .
they' re insecure .
no , i' m not insecure .
i' m freaking out .
yes .
that' s right .
brilliant !
you' re playing a role .
no , you' re playing a role .
i' m apparently playing a real person .
yeah , so ?
it' s just wrong .
you mean , like , morally ?
no .
well , yes .
probably ...
it' s not the point .
the point is you want me to speak ... ... for someone who' s out there somewhere .
it' s too personal .
more personal than your husband doing 25 to life ?
he won' t do 25 to life .
benedict will have him killed immediately .
don' t .
i' m sorry , that was stupid .
we' re gonna be in and out in 10 minutes .
we have to .
that' s our time frame .
you don' t even have to talk .
give them a big smile , wave at the cameras .
that' s all she ever does .
but if you do say something ... ... don' t forget your accent .
drop your g' s , and longer vowels .
room service .
it' s gonna be fine .
you' ve gotta remember something .
you are an image to these people .
you' re like an object .
nobody actually knows you .
the last thing this is gonna be is personal .
aren' t you overdue ?
why are you in rome ?
i' m here on vacation .
i love you .
you are not supposed to fly eight months pregnant .
i know .
is danny here ?
of course .
danny .
no , no , i mean , he has ...
he' s working ?
yes .
yes and no .
he' s working .
in rome ?
bruce .
glen snackwell , publicity .
hey , glen .
i' m a big fan .
thanks .
great .
you fired marcy ?
you fired marcy .
two weeks ago , you told me i should go with marcy .
i' m sorry .

there' s a story ?
always a story with marcy .
marcy ...
marcy ...
you look fantastic .
such a surprise .
you should sit down .
i' m with the studio .
marcy' s still very much in the picture .
i just wanted to get you for a second .
we' re looking to come off this baby thing strong .
you know , that little statue on the mantle starts smirking at you after a while .
you know what i' m saying ?
not really , glen , no .
sorry .
yeah .
hey , jules , that reminds me .
i' ve been meaning to call you since the girls and i were in taos .
it' s so good to see you .
come here .
these are a mess .
anyway , tallulah left her spongebob blanket in the red casita .
okay .
so , what i wanna do ...
here .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
thanks , bruce .
is call marcus ... ... and have him get ahold of louise so we can make arrangements to get it .
he' s home now , right ?
marcus ...
i need to talk to marcus .
that' s so funny .
what a coincidence .
go ahead .
talk to him .
over by the window , with the reception .
hello ?
hello , marcus ?
no , it' s julia .
who' s this ?
it' s julia .
i' m with bruce willis .
you' re with bruce right now ?
can i speak with him ?
oh , yes , tallulah' s spongebob .
i' m sorry , can i talk to him for a sec ?
did it drop out ?
yes , it fell out .
that' s been happening all week .
put that phone away right now .
what ?
hang it up and put it away .
do you have any idea how vulnerable ... ... a fetus ' brain is to the electromagnetic field created by your cell phone ?
you might as well point a gun at her stomach .
i' m bruce willis .
simon leopold .
i am julia' s physician .
he' s a doctor .
what happened to dr. webber ?
you know , doc ... ?
he was sick .
dr. webber is on vacation .
well , he' s sick .
he' s sick on vacation .
sick on vacation .
don' t you hate that ?
sick on vacation .
sorry to have jumped on you , mr. willis .
you do very good actings .
thank you .
snackbar .
snackwell .
it doesn' t matter .
if we are to get there at 4 : 00 and do that ...
i say 50 50 .
closer than that .
2 1 they don' t make it to the museum .
5 1 they don' t make it to the egg room .
what ?
she' s still my wife .
she' s a novice .
you said so .
led by an apprentice .
being tracked by a pro .
you want her to win .
which her ?
you know which her .
the one that started all this .
right .
good .
for a minute ...
why would i say that ?
it' s not her fault .
it wasn' t .
okay , then .
good .
good .
i' m confused .
yeah , who are you talking about ?
isabel .
tess .
i loved it , but i figured it out .
not a lot of people did .
that' s amazing .
the second she doesn' t ... ... talk to you in the restaurant , i knew ...
you figured that out .
yeah , i mean , the movie still works for me .
great .
can we just ... ?
does she really need to be rushing this quickly ?
she' s practically jogging .
in thailand ... ... mothers routinely give birth in rice paddies and then go right back to work .
amazing women over there .
rice paddy ?
she will not have it in a rice paddy .
she' il be at her own paddy .
and she will be very comfortable because she will be strong ... ... from this walk and this exercise .
was she worth it ?
was tess ?
the moment that she doesn' t talk to you in the restaurant , i knew .
your friends didn' t tell you ?
no .
that' s when you figured it out , huh ?
yeah .
but the movie was still enjoyable for me .
okay .
thanks .
if everybody' s so freaking smart , how come the movie did $675 million worldwide ... ... theatrical ?
julia .
doctor .
doctor , you might wanna call the rice paddy now .
seal off the museum .
nobody in or out .
bring ...
bring it , bring it .
quickly , quickly .
sit her down .
sit her down .
everybody just relax .
can you hear me ?
talk to me .
she is fine .
she is fine .
she' s good ?
okay , that' s it .
we' re done here .
no more pictures .
thank you , bruce willis .
just don' t worry .
thank you , museum .
we are code four .
walk slowly , like you' re doing .
we' il get you into the car as fast as we can .
okay , we' re not stopping .
don' t stop .
hello .
we' re on our way out .
isabel lahiri , i' m with the museum .
it is so great to meet you .
we' re very late .
i' m sorry , this won' t take long .
i don' t wanna be an annoying fan , but my boyfriend is such a huge fan .
i can' t let you leave unless you sign something for him .
do you mind ?
that' s very unorthodox .
sorry , it won' t take long .
what' s his name ?
his name' s robert .
aren' t you a lefty ?
i thought you were a lefty .
she is a lefty .
often pregnant women become ambidextrous .
you are a big fan .
she doesn' t necessarily have to sign lefty .
oh , thanks so much .
this is great .
okay .
we' re on the move .
thank you .
you take care , now .
and one more thing .
i just got off the phone ... ... with someone called marcy who put you on a plane from taos , new mexico to l. a ... ... where you have a 1 : 00 meeting about a film , clowns can' t sleep .
anyway , she just wanted me to let you know everyone' s running a little late ... ... and was wondering if you could make it at 1 : 30 instead .
i knew it .
shame on you .
i don' t think we' ve met .
bruce .
isabel lahiri .
nice to meet you .
do you really have a boyfriend ?
or were you just ... ?
was that just part of the whole thing with them ?
so how' d it go ?
you lahiri ?
i' m section chief molly starr .
i spoke to a very nice man at europol this morning , commissioner greisman .
he wants you on the next flight to amsterdam .
there seems to be some irregularity with your paperwork .
that one .
let' s start with that one .
imagine yourself in a room ... ... that' s too short for you to stand up in and not wide enough for you to lie down in .
a room with no light , no heat ... ... and stone walls scratched by the teeth and nails of desperate men ... ... men driven crazy by isolation .
you will have rats for company ... ... and a small window that looks out on the world that has passed you by .
your parents will grow old and die , just like your dreams .
your friends will forget your name , tell your stories as their own ... ... because what good is a story when the person who owns it has vanished ?
what do you want ?
testify against the others ... ... in the benedict case .
the italian charges will be dropped .
you and the others will be extradited to the u. s. this afternoon .
plead , and you walk with parole .
i can' t .
think about it , linus .
for a moment there , i was already forgetting your name .
wait .
just hang on a sec .
linus .
right .
thanks .
you okay ?
well , i blew the meet with matsui .
matsui ?
let me guess .
he pulled a lost in translation on you .
that' s his idea of fun for first timers .
i mean ...
how do i not see these things ?
don' t get down on yourself .
obvious .
we talked about this .
i hope danny and rusty appreciate the job you did in a tight jam .
i am proud of you .
thanks .
we both are .
you ... ?
you told dad ?
i had to , sweetheart .
you told dad ?
we were on vacation .
i' m sorry .
great .
thanks .
you' re gonna be dining out on this one for months .
hey , remember the time your mom had to come to rome ...
i' m sorry .
every time with him .
it' s like ...
it' s like a ...
it' s like a ...
that was for keeping me in the dark .
and that ...
that ... ... is for making me a master thief .
and that ...
okay . ... is for ruining our second third anniversary .
okay .
okay ?
come here .
i' m sorry i kept you in the dark .
i' m sorry that i made you a thief .
master .
master thief .
and i' m very sorry that i ruined our second third anniversary .
okay ?
okay .
you forgive me ?
a little .
all right .
what was bruce willis like ?
was he ... ?
follow it .
that' s ryan' s car .
follow that one .
hey , wait , wait !
what the hell is going on ?
your father' s alive , lzzy .
your mom lied to you ... ... to keep you from him .
he' s alive .
what are you talking about ?
when they divorced , she told him if he contacted you , she' d go to the cops ... ... with everything to put him in jail .
how do you know that ?
and why should i believe you ?
i don' t believe you , okay ?
you know where he is ?
i know somebody who does .
there' s nothing back there but a forged 1077 .
no .
really ?
no .
no .
that' d be horrible .
it' s hard , you know , for dinners .
well , you must have very good contacts .
i hear it usually takes days to buy your way out .
tess , this is franois toulour .
madame ocean , at last .
hello .
he' s french .
shouldn' t you be somewhere else by now , like ... ... outer mongolia , maybe ?
well , before we get to that , we just wanted to ask you one question .
what is that ?
how' d you do it ?
oh , so that' s why you came .
you wanna know .
well , i guess that' s normal .
but i got another deal for you .
you both recognize that i' m the best , and i' il tell you my secret .
yeah .
that ...
make it if you get him to tell us ... ... and tell him that he is the best .
oh , okay .
i won' t tell him because you' re the best .
all right .
thank you .
all right .
we' il tell you you' re the best after you tell us how you did it .
how can i refuse a dying man' s last request ?
the egg arrived in rome at 6 : 45 p . m .
the saturday before it went on display .
it was at the museum by 8 p . m .
wait a minute , hold on .
you stole it that evening ?
with the museum locked down ?
how' d you get in the building ?
how' d you get past the sensors ?
why didn' t my recon team see you ?
don' t touch my thing .
i didn' t touch your thing .
like it works .
you got greasy hands , you put them on the lens .
now i can' t see .
you can' t see anything .
i see you .
you look like a retard .
you look like a retard .
i' il pay you a million dollars if you don' t speak for a month .
one month .
i wanna eat your whole head .
go ahead .
a million dollars .
no joke .
right .
with no equipment , no rope .
of course .
come on , don' t tell me you don' t know how to do that .
how did you get by the laser field in the great hall ?
the laser fields .
well ...
okay .
toulour , you' re the best .
well , thank you , danny .
good .
now , if you can just get us our money ... ... we' il be going .
the money ?
what money ?
the money that you agreed to pay benedict if we won .
we' re under a deadline .
no , no , no , you don' t understand .
you didn' t win .
you lost .
and not only did you lose ... ... your entire crew got pinched .
i gotta tell you something .
you don' t look anything like her .
eventually , the nose , but the ears ...
i mean , the way you walk and you dress ...
that means that you spoke to lemarc .
you spoke to lemarc ?
since i' m dead , i think my involvement in this should stay among the three of us .
of course .
absolutely .
it' s ironic that the solution to all of our problems will be provided by toulour .
i' m sure i provoked him by agreeing with my american friend that you might be better .
i apologize sincerely for the trouble i' ve caused you .
there' s no need .
especially now .
remember , from the time you see toulour at his villa and the challenge begins ... ... you must assume he will have you under surveillance everywhere you go .
you' il have to put on a very elaborate show .
the egg , the real egg ... ... will be carried in a backpack on a train leaving gare du nord ... ... at 9 : 30 a . m .
thank you .
you saved our lives , gaspar .
yeah .
and i' m still getting the better of you .
and i stole a replica ?
your paintings are in a high security warehouse in milan .
it' s 17 via andreotti , unit 222 .
security code is 2 3 1 1 6 ...
6 4 6 .
thank you .
listen , all games aside , that was ...
that was very good .
that was good .
how' d you do that ?
well , i told you one story tonight .
i think that' il be enough .
so now ... ... if you , both of you , could please ...
now .
whose house is this ?
it belongs to a thief i know in paris .
he knows my father ?
probably better than anyone .
who is he ?
he helped with the whole night fox thing .
what' s his name ?
his real name ?
i don' t know , actually .
i' ve only known him as lemarc .
lemarc ?
oh , my god .
where the hell have you been ?
waiting .
for what ?
for this .
oh , my god .
so we done ?
issue closed ?
is it actually good ?
it' s good .
trust me .
i don' t trust you , and i don' t trust ocean .
if it' s good , we' re done .
these grudges , they' re awful .
nobody wins .
danny' s had enough of this meshugaas .
and the competition , it' s worse than our business .
always some new young punk trying to prove himself .
guys like ocean , they keep coming back .
they don' t like to lose .
too much ego , too much pride .
maybe for some guys , but not danny .
trust me on that .
danny don' t feel like he lost in all this .
it' s hard to believe , but that' s how he feels .
well , if he tries anything ...
if anybody tries anything , i' il be waiting .
terry , i can' t predict the future .
i pay professionals to do that , and even they get it wrong sometimes .
i can' t say that nobody' il ever try to rob from you again .
lf , god forbid , anything does happen to you ... ... we will not be involved .
you better not be , reuben .
you better not be .
hey .
good to see you guys .
you don' t remember ?
you put me through hell , and you don' t remember ?
hey .
hey .
you' re more beautiful than ever .
hey !
five oh five ?
four oh five .
who' s winning ?
i' m little .
and you' re big .
you' re big ?
oh , my god .
hello .
oh , my god .
you' re all under arrest .
you' re thieves .
you' re crooks .
isabel , livingston dell .
thank you .
isabel , tess .
the adult table .
that' s the kids ' table .
let me clear that for you .
i' m in .
can i get another beer ?
i feel i know you .
wait , wait .
we didn' t ... we didn' t bet .
you want five ?
five .
so nasty .
okay .
is that a joke ?
yes .
jesus christ .
she' s drunk !
