drink up me ' earties yo ho !
we kidnap and ravage and don' t give a hoot .
drink up me ' earties yo ho !
yo ho yo ho a pirate' s life for me .
we extort , we pilfer , we filch and sack .
drink up
quiet , missy , cursed pirates sail these waters .
you don' t want to bring them down on us now , do ya ?
mr. gibbs that will do !
she was singing about pirates .
bad luck to be singing about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog .
mark my words .
consider them marked .
on your way .
aye , lieutenant .
it' s bad luck to have a woman on board , too , even a miniature one .
i think it' d be rather exciting to meet a pirate .
think again , miss swann .
vile and dissolute creatures , the lot of them .
i intend to see to that any man who sails under a pirate flag or ... ... wears a pirate brand gets what he deserves .
a short drop and a sudden stop .
lieutenant norrington , i appreciate your fervor .
but i' m ... i' m concerned about the effect this subject will have upon my daughter .
my apologies , governor swann .
actually , i find it all fascinating .
yes , that' s what concerns me .
look , a boy !
there' s a boy in the water !
man overboard !
haul him aboard !
he' s still breathing .
mary , mother of god !
what happened here ?
it' s most likely the powder magazine .
merchant vessels run heavily armed .
a lot of good it did them .
everyone' s thinking it .
i' m just saying it ... pirates !
there' s no proof of that .
it was probably an accident .
rouse the captain immediately !
aye , sir .
heave to and take in sail , launch the boats .
elizabeth i want you to accompany the boy .
he' il be in your charge .
take care of him .
it' s ok .
my name' s elizabeth swann .
will turner .
i' m watching over you , will .
you' re a pirate !
has he said anything ?
his name is william turner , that' s all i found out .
take him below .
elizabeth !
are you alright ?
are you decent ?
yes , yes !
still abed at this hour ?
it' s a beautiful day .
i have a gift for you .
oh , it' s beautiful !
isn' t it ?
may i inquire as to the occasion ?
does a father need an occasion to dote upon his daughter ?
go on .
actually , i , uh ...
i had hoped you might wear it for the ceremony today .
the ceremony ?
captain norringtons promotion ceremony .
i knew it !
commodore norrington he' s about to become .
fine gentleman , don' t you think .
he fancies you .
elizabeth ?
how' s it coming ?
it' s difficult to say .
i' m told it' s the latest fashion in london .
well , women in london must' ve learned not to breathe .
m' lord , you have a visitor .
ah , mr. turner , good to see you again .
good day , sir .
i have your order .
the blade is folded steel , that' s gold filigree laid into the handle .
if i may ?
perfectly balanced .
the tang is nearly the full width of the blade .
impressive , very impressive .
ah , now , commodore norrington is going to be very pleased with this .
do pass my compliments on to your master .
i shall .
a craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated .
ah , elizabeth , you look absolutely stunning .
will .
so good to see you !
i had a dream about you last night .
about me ?
elizabeth , is that entirely proper for you to ... ?
about the day we met , do you remember ?
how could i forget , miss swann ?
will , how many times must i ask you to call me elizabeth ?
at least once more , miss swann , as always .
there , see , at least the boy has a sense of propriety .
now , we really must be going .
farewell .
good day , mr. turner .
come along .
good day ... ... elizabeth .
what ?
hold up there , you .
it' s a shilling to tie up your boat at the dock .
and i shall need to know your name .
what d' ye say to three shillings and we forget the name ?
welcome to port royal , mr. smith .
two paces front !
right about turn !
present ... ... arms !
this dock is off limits to civilians .
i' m terribly sorry , i didn' t know .
if i see one ... ... i shall inform you immediately .
apparently there' s some sort of a high toned and fancy to do up at the fort , eh ?
how could it be that two upstanding gentlemen such as yourselves did not merit an invitation ?
someone has to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians .
it' s a fine goal to be sure but it seems to me that a ... a ship like that makes this one here a bit superfluous , really .
ah , the dauntless is the power in these waters , true enough , but there' s no ship that can match the interceptor for speed .
i' ve heard of one , supposed to be very fast , nigh un catchable ...
the black pearl
well ... there' s no real ship that can match the interceptor .
the black pearl is a real ship .
no , no it' s not .
yes , it is , i' ve seen it .
you' ve seen it ?
yes .
you haven' t seen it .
yes , i have .
you' ve seen a ship with black sails ... ... that' s crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil ... ... that hell itself spat him back out ?
no .
no .
but i have seen a ship with black sails .
oh , and no ship that' s not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil ... ... that hell itself spat him back out could possibly ... ... have black sails therefore couldn' t possibly be any other ... ... ship than the black pearl .
is that what you' re saying ?
no .
like i said there' s no real ship that can match the interceptor
hey !
you !
get away from there !
you don' t have permission to be aboard there , mate .
i' m sorry , it' s just it' s such a pretty boat ship .
what' s your name ?
smith or ... smithy , if you like .
what' s your purpose in port royal , mr. smith ?
yeah , and no lies !
well , then , i confess , it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships .
pick up a crew in tortuga , raid , pillage , plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out .
i said no lies .
i think he' s telling the truth .
if he were telling the truth , he wouldn' t have told us .
unless , of course , he knew you wouldn' t believe the truth even if he told it to you .
may i have a moment ?
you look lovely , elizabeth .
yes ?
i apologize if i seem forward but i ... must speak my mind .
this promotion throws into sharp relief that which i have ... ... not yet achieved .
a marriage to a fine woman .
you have become a fine woman , elizabeth .
i can' t breathe .
yes , i' m a bit nervous myself .
... and then they made me their chief .
elizabeth ?
elizabeth !
the rocks !
sir , it' s a miracle she missed them !
will you be saving her then ?
i can' t swim .
pearl of the kings navy you are .
do not lose these .
what was that ?
i got her .
not breathing .
move !
never would have thought of that .
clearly you' ve never been to singapore .
where did you get that ?
on your feet .
elizabeth .
are you alright ?
yes , i' m fine .
shoot him !
father !
commodore , do you really intend to kill my rescuer ?
i believe thanks are in order .
had a brush with the east india trading company , did we ?
pirate ?
hang him .
keep your guns on him , men .
gillette , fetch some irons .
well , well ...
jack sparrow , isn' t it ?
captain jack sparrow , if you please , sir .
well , i don' t see your ship ... captain .
i' m in the market as it were .
he said he' d come to commandeer one .
told ya he was telling the truth .
these are his , sir .
no additional shots nor powder .
a compass that doesn' t point north .
and i half expected it to be made of wood .
you are , without doubt , the worst pirate i' ve ever heard of .
but you have heard of me .
commodore , i really must protest .
carefully lieutenant .
pirate or not this man saved my life .
one good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness .
though it seems enough to condemn him .
indeed .
finally .
no , don' t shoot !
i knew you' d warm up to me .
commodore norrington , my effects , please ... ... and my hat .
commodore !
elizabeth , it is elizabeth isn' t it ?
it' s miss swann .
miss swann , if you' d be so kind .
come , come , dear , we don' t have all day .
now if you' d be very kind .
easy on the goods , darling .
you' re despicable .
sticks and stones , love .
i saved your life , you saved mine , we' re square .
gentlemen , m' lady , you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught ... ... captain jack sparrow .
now , will you shoot him ?
open fire !
on his heels !
gillette , mr. sparrow has a dawn appointment with the gallows ... ... i would hate for him to miss it .
search upstairs .
look lively , men .
right where i left you .
not where i left you .
you' re the one they' re hunting .
the pirate .
you seem somewhat familiar .
have i threatened you before ?
i make a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates .
ah .
well , then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record .
so , if you' il excuse me ...
do you think this wise , boy ... ... crossing blades with a pirate ?
you threatened miss swann .
only a little .
you know what you' re doing , i' il give you that .
excellent form ... ... but how' s your footwork ?
if i step here ...
very good .
now i step again .
ta .
that is a wonderful trick .
except once again you are between me and my way out .
and now you have no weapon .
who makes all these ?
i do !
and i practice with them ... ... three hours a day !
you need to find yourself a girl , mate .
or , perhaps the reason you practice three hours a day is that you already found one ... ... and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet .
you' re not a eunuch , are you ?
i practice three hours a day , so that when i meet a pirate ... ... i can kill it .
you cheated !
pirate !
move away !
no !
please , move !
no !
i cannot just step aside and let you escape .
this shot is not meant for you .
excellent work , mr. brown .
you' ve assisted in the capture of a dangerous fugitive .
just doing my civic duty , sir .
well , i trust you' il always remember this as the day that captain ... ... jack sparrow almost escaped .
take him away !
can you smell it ?
come here , boy .
want a nice juicy bone ?
come here , boy .
you can keep doing that forever , the dog is never going to move .
oh , excuse us if we haven' t resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet .
there you go , miss .
it' s a difficult day for you , i am sure .
i suspected commodore norrington would propose but ... ... i must admit i wasn' t entirely prepared for it .
well , i meant you being threatened by that pirate , sounds terrifying .
oh , yes , it was terrifying .
but the commodore proposed .
fancy that .
now that' s a smart match , miss , if it' s not too bold to say .
it is a smart match .
he' s a fine man .
the sort any woman should dream of marrying .
well , that will turner , he' s a fine man too .
that is too bold .
well , begging your pardon , miss , it was not my place .
has my daughter given you an answer yet ?
no , she hasn' t .
well , she has had a very trying day .
ghastly weather , don' t you think ?
bleak , very bleak .
what' s that ?
cannon fire !
return fire !
i know those guns .
it' s the pearl .
black pearl ?
i' ve heard stories .
she' s been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years .
never leaves any survivors .
no survivors ?
then where do the stories come from , i wonder ?
governor .
barricade yourself in my office .
that' s an order !
don' t !
hello , chump .
up there !
girl !
miss swann , they' ve come to kidnap you .
what ?
you' re the governors daughter .
they haven' t seen you .
hide and the first chance you get , run to the fort .
gotcha !
it' s hot !
it' s on me !
come on .
we know you' re here , poppet .
poppet .
come out .
we promise we wont hurt you .
we will find you , poppet .
you' ve got something of ours and it calls to us .
the gold calls to us .
gold calls ...
' ello , poppet .
parley !
what ?
parley .
i invoke the right of parley .
according to the code of the brethren , set down by the pirates morgan and bartholomew ... ... you have to take me to your captain .
i know the code .
if an adversary demands parley you can do them no harm until ... ... the parley is complete .
to blazes with the code .
she wants to be taken to the captain .
and she' il go without a fuss .
we must honor the code .
say goodbye !
goodbye .
come on !
elizabeth .
outta my way , scum !
my sympathies friend , you' ve no manner of luck at all .
come on , doggy .
it' s just you and me now .
it' s you and ol ' jack , come on .
come on , good boy .
that s it , good boy , come on !
bit closer , bit closer .
that' s it , that' s it , doggy .
come on you filthy , slimy , mangy cad .
no , no , no , no , no , i didn' t mean it .
i didn' t ...
this ain' t the armory .
well , well , well , look what we have here twigg ?
captain jack sparrow .
last time i saw you , you were all alone on a godforsaken island .
shrinking into the distance .
his fortunes aren' t improved much .
worry about your own fortunes , gentlemen .
the deepest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers .
so there is a curse .
that' s interesting .
you know nothing of hell .
that' s very interesting .
i didn' t know we were takin ' on captives .
she' s invoked the right of parley with captain barbossa .
i am here to negotiate ...
you will speak when spoken to .
and ye' il not lay a hand on those under the protection of parley .
aye , sir .
my apologies , miss .
captain barbossa , i am here to negotiate the cessation of hostilities ... ... against port royal .
there are a lot of long words in there , miss , we' re naught but humble pirates .
what is it that you want ?
i want you to leave and never come back .
i' m disinclined to acquiesce to your request ... ... means no .
very well .
i' il drop it .
me holds are burstin ' with swag and that bit of shine matters to us ?
why ?
it' s what you' ve been searching for .
i recognized the ship .
i saw it eight years ago on the crossing from england .
did ya now ?
fine .
well , i suppose if it is worthless then there' s no point in me keeping it .
you have a name , missy ?
elizabeth ...
turner .
i' m a maid in the governors household .
miss turner ... ?
bootstrap .
and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that ?
family heirloom , perhaps ?
i didn' t steal it if that' s what you mean .
very well , you hand it over and we' il put your town to our rudder and never return .
our bargain ?
still the guns and stow ' em , signal the men , set the flags ...
wait !
you have to take me to shore .
according to the code of the order of the brethren ...
first , your return to shore was not part of our negotiations ... ... nor our agreement so i must do nothing .
and secondly , you must be a pirate for the pirates code to apply and you' re not
and thirdly , the code is more what you' d call " guidelines " than actual rules .
welcome aboard the black pearl , miss turner .
they' ve taken her .
they' ve taken elizabeth .
mr. murtogg , remove this man .
we have to hunt them down , we must save her .
and where do you propose we start ?
if you have any information concerning my daughter , please , share it .
that jack sparrow .
he talked about the black pearl .
mentioned it , is more what he did .
ask him where it is .
make a deal with him he could lead us to it .
no ... the pirates who invaded this fort left sparrow locked in his cell ergo .... ... they are not his allies .
governor , we will establish their most likely course ...
that' s not good enough !
mr. turner , you are not a military man , you are not a sailor .
you are a blacksmith and this is not the moment for rash actions .
do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here ... ... who cares for elizabeth .
you , sparrow !
aye .
you are familiar with that ship , the black pearl ?
i' ve heard of it .
where does it make berth ?
where does it make berth ?
have you not heard the stories ?
captain barbossa and his crew of miscreants sailed from the dreaded isla de muerta .
it' s an island that cannot be found except by those who already know where it is .
the ships real enough .
therefore it' s anchorage must be a real place .
where is it ?
why ask me ?
because you' re a pirate .
and you want to turn pirate yourself , is that it ?
never .
they took miss swann .
oh , so it is that you' ve found a girl .
i see .
well , if you' re intending to brave all , hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady' s heart ... ... you' il have to do it alone , mate .
i see no profit in it for me .
i can get you out of here .
how' s that ?
the keys run off .
i helped build these cells .
these are half pin barrel hinges .
with the right leverage and a proper application of strength ... ... the door will lift free .
what' s your name ?
will turner .
that will be short for william , i imagine .
good , strong name .
no doubt , named for your father , aye ?
yes .
well , mr. turner , i' ve changed me mind .
if you spring me from this cell , i swear on pain of death ... ... i shall take you to the black pearl and your bonny lass .
do we have an accord ?
agreed .
agreed , get me out .
hurry , someone will have heard that .
not without my effects .
we' re going to steal a ship ?
that ship ?
commandeer .
we' re going to commandeer that ship .
nautical term .
one question about your business boy , or there' s no use going .
this girl , how far are you willing to go to save her ?
i' d die for her .
oh , good .
no worries , then .
this is either madness or brilliance .
it' s remarkable how often those two traits coincide .
everyone stay calm , we are taking over the ship .
aye , avast !
this ship cannot be crewed by two men .
you' il never make it out of the bay .
son .
i' m captain jack sparrow , savvy ?
commodore !
sir , they' ve taken the dauntless !
they' ve taken the ship .
sparrow and turner , they' ve taken the dauntless !
rash , turner , too rash .
he is without doubt the worst pirate i have ever seen .
here they come .
bring her around !
bring her around !
search every cabin , every hold , down to the bilges .
sailors , back to the interceptor !
now !
quickly men !
thank you , commodore , for getting us ready to make way .
we' d have a hard time of it by ourselves .
set top sails and clear up this mess .
with the wind a quarter astern , we wont catch them .
we don' t need to catch them just get them in range of the long nines .
men , come about .
run out the guns .
we open fire on our own ship , sir ?
i' d rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate .
commodore , he' s disabled the rudder chain , sir .
abandon ship !
that' s got to be the best pirate i' ve ever seen .
so it would seem .
when i was a lad living in england , my mother raised me by herself .
after she died , i came out here , looking for my father .
is that so ?
my father , will turner .
and in jail it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help .
since that' s what i wanted , i didn' t press the matter .
i' m not a simpleton , jack .
you knew my father .
i knew ' im .
probably one the few who knew him as william turner .
everyone else just called him bootstrap or bootstrap bill .
bootstrap ?
good man , good pirate .
i swear you look just like him .
it' s not true .
he was a merchant sailor , a good , respectable man who obeyed the law .
he was a bloody pirate , a scallywag .
my father was not a pirate .
put it away , son .
it' s not worth you getting beat again .
you didn' t beat me .
you ignored the rules of engagement .
in a fair fight .
i' d killed you .
and that' s no incentive for me to fight fair , is it ?
now as long as you' re just hanging there , pay attention .
what a man can do and what a man can' t do .
for instance you can accept that your father was a pirate and a good man ... ... or you can' t .
but pirate is in your blood , boy , so you' il have to square with that someday .
and me , for example , i can let you drown .
but i can' t bring this ship into tortuga all by me onesies , savvy ?
so ...
can you sail under the command of a pirate ... ... or can you not ?
tortuga ?
tortuga .
more importantly , it is indeed a sad life that has never breathed deep the sweet proliferous bouquet that is tortuga , savvy ?
what do you think ?
it' il linger .
i' il tell you mate .
if every town in the world were like this one ... ... no man would ever feel unwanted .
scarlett !
not sure i deserved that .
giselle !
who was she ?
what ?
i may have deserved that .
curse you for breathing , you slack jawed idiot !
mother' s love !
jack !
you should know better then to wake a man when he' s sleeping .
it' s bad luck ah , fortunately i know how to counter it .
the man who did the waking buys , the man who was sleeping , a drink .
the man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to a proposition ... ... from the man who did the waking .
aye , that' il about do it .
blast !
i' m already awake !
that was for the smell .
keep a sharp eye !
now , what' s the nature of this venture you are in ?
i' m going after the black pearl .
i know where it' s going to be and i' m going to take it .
jack , it' s a fool' s errand .
well , you know better than me the tales of the black pearl .
that' s why i know what barbossa is up to ... ... all i need is a crew .
from what i hear tell of captain barbossa , he' s not a man to suffer fools nor strike a bargain with one .
well , then i say it' s a very good thing i' m not a fool then , aye ?
prove me wrong .
what makes ye think barbossa will give up his ship to you ?
let' s just say it' s a matter of leverage , aye ?
the kid ?
that is the child of bootstrap bill turner .
his only child , savvy ?
is he now ?
leverage says you ... ... i think i feel a change in the wind says i. i' il find us a crew ... ... there' s bound to be some sailors on this rock crazy as you .
one can only hope .
take what you can ...
give nothing back .
you' il be dinin ' with the captain .
and he requests you wear this .
well , you may tell the captain that i am disinclined to acquiesce to his request .
he said you' d say that .
he also said if that be the case ... ... you' il be dinin ' with the crew ... ... and you' il be naked .
fine .
there' s no need to stand on ceremony , nor call to impress anyone .
you must be hungry .
try the wine .
and the apples ?
one of those next .
it' s poisoned .
there would be no sense to be killing ye miss turner .
then release me , you have your trinket .
i' m of no further value to you .
you don' t know what this is , do ye ?
it' s a pirate medallion .
this is aztec gold .
one of 882 identical pieces they delivered in a stone chest to corts himself .
blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies .
but the greed of corts was insatiable .
so the heathen gods placed upon the gold a terrible curse .
any mortal that removes but a piece from that stone chest ... ... shall be punished for eternity .
i hardly believe in ghost stories anymore , captain barbossa .
aye .
that' s exactly what i thought when we were first told the tale .
buried on an island that cannot be found except ... ... for those who know where it is .
find it , we did .
there be the chest ... ... inside be the gold .
we took them all !
spent them and traded them .
we frittered them away ... on drink and food and pleasurable company .
the more we gave them away , the more we came to realize ... ... the drink would not satisfy , food turned to ash in our mouths ... ... and all the pleasurable company in the world could not slake our lust .
we are cursed men , miss turner .
compelled by greed we were , and now we are consumed by it .
there is one way we can end our curse .
all the scattered pieces of the aztec gold must be restored ... ... and the blood repaid .
thanks to you we have the final piece .
and the blood to be repaid ?
that' s why there' s no sense to be killing you ... yet !
apple ?
i' m curious , after killing me what is it you are planning on doing next ?
look !
the moonlight shows us for what we really are .
we are not among the living and so we cannot die .
but neither are we dead .
for too long i' ve been parched with thirst and unable to quench it .
too long i' ve been starving to death and haven' t died .
i feel nothing , not the wind on my face nor the spray of the sea .
nor the warmth of a woman' s flesh .
you best start believing in ghost stories miss turner ... you' re in one !
what are ye looking at ?
back to work !
feast your eyes , captain .
all of them , faithful hands before the mast .
every man worth his salt .
and crazy to boot .
so this is your able bodied crew ?
you , sailor !
cotton , sir .
mr. cotton !
do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death ?
mr. cotton !
answer man !
he' s a mute , sir .
poor devil had his tongue cut out , so he trained the parrot to talk for him .
no one' s yet figured how .
mr. cotton' s ... parrot .
same question .
wind in the sails !
wind in the sails !
mostly , we figure , that means " yes " .
o' course it does .
satisfied ?
well , you' ve proved they' re mad .
and what' s the benefit for us ?
anamaria .
i suppose you didn' t deserve that one either ?
no , that one i deserved .
you stole my boat !
actually ...
borrowed , borrowed without permission .
but with every intention of bringing it back to you .
but you didn' t !
you' il get another one i will .
a better one .
a better one !
that one !
what one ?
that one ?
aye !
that one .
what say you ?
aye !
no , no , no , no , no , it' s frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard , sir .
it' d be far worse not to , however .
how can we sail to an island that nobody can find ... ... with a compass that doesn' t work ?
aye , the compass doesn' t point north ... ... but we' re not trying to find north , are we ?
we should drop canvas , sir .
she can hold a bit longer .
what' s in your head that' s put you in such a fine mood , captain ?
we' re catching up .
time to go , poppet !
dead men tell no tales .
puts a chill in the bones how many honest sailors have been claimed by this passage .
how is it that jack came by that compass ?
not a lot known about jack sparrow before he showed up in tortuga ... ... with a mind to go after the treasure of the isla de muerta .
that was before i met him .
back when he was captain of the black pearl .
what ?
he failed to mention that .
well , he plays things close to the vest now .
and a hard learned lesson it was .
see three days out on the venture the first mate comes to him and says ... ... everything' s an equal share as should be the location of the treasure too .
so , jack gives up the bearings .
that night there was a mutiny .
they marooned jack on an island and left him to die .
but not before he' d gone mad with the heat .
so that' s the reason for all the ...
reason' s got nothing to do with it .
now will , when a pirate is marooned he is a given a pistol with a single shot .
one shot .
well it won' t do much good hunting or to be rescued .
but after three weeks of starvin ' belly and thirst that pistol ... ... starts to look real friendly .
but jack , he escaped the island and he still has that single shot .
oh , but he won' t use it though , save for one man .
his mutinous first mate .
barbossa .
aye .
how did jack get off the island ?
well , i' il tell you .
he waded out into the shallows and he waited there three days and three nights ... till all manner of sea creature came and acclimated to his presence .
and on the fourth morning ... he roped himself a couple of sea turtles , rushed them together and made a raft !
he roped a couple of sea turtles ?
aye , sea turtles .
what did he use for rope ?
human hair ... ... from my back .
let go of the anchor !
let go of the anchor , sir .
young mr. turner and i are to go ashore .
captain !
what if the worst should happen ?
keep to the code .
aye , the code .
ten years of hoarding swag .
and now we' re finally getting to spend it .
once we' re quit of the curse we' il be rich men .
and you can buy an eye that actually fits and is made of glass .
this one does splinter something terrible .
stop rubbing it .
what code is gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen ?
pirate' s code .
any man who falls behind is left behind .
no heroes amongst thieves , eh ?
you know for having such a bleak outlook on pirates you' re well on your way to becoming one .
sprung a man from jail , commandeered a ship of the fleet ... sailed with a buccaneer crew out of tortuga .
and you' re completely obsessed with treasure .
that' s not true .
i' m not obsessed with treasure .
not all treasure is silver and gold , mate .
gentlemen , the time has come !
salvation is nigh !
our torment is near at end !
elizabeth .
for ten years we' ve been tested and tried and each man jack of you here ... has proved his mettle a hundred times over and a hundred times again !
suffered i have .
punished we were .
the lot of us disproportionate to our crime .
here it is !
the cursed treasure of corts himself .
every last piece that went astray we have returned ... save for this .
jack !
not yet .
we wait for the opportune moment .
when' s that ?
when it' s of greatest profit to you ?
may i ask you something ?
have i ever given you reason not to trust me ?
do us a favor , i know it' s difficult for you but please stay here ... and try not to do anything stupid .
and who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods ?
us !
and whose blood must yet to be paid ?
hers !
you know the first thing i' m goin ' to do after the curse is lifted ... ... eat a whole bushel of apples .
begun by blood , by blood undone .
sorry , jack , i' m not going to be your leverage .
that' s it ?
waste not .
did it work ?
i don' t feel no different .
how do we tell ?
you' re not dead .
no .
he shot me !
it didn' t work .
the curse is still upon us !
yes !
you , maid !
your father , what was his name ?
was your father william turner ?
no .
where' s his child ?
the child that sailed from england eight years ago ?
the child in whose veins flows the blood of william turner ?
where ?
you two .
you brought us the wrong person !
no !
she had the medallion , she' s the proper age .
she said her name was turner , you heard her !
stupid blighter .
you brought us here for nothing !
i won' t take questions and no second guesses , not from the likes of you , master twigg .
who' s to blame ?
every decision you' ve made has led us from bad to worse .
it was you who sent bootstrap to the depths !
and it' s you who brought us here in the first place !
any coward here dare challenge me , let him speak !
i say , we cut her throat and spill all her blood .
just in case .
yeah !
the medallion !
she' s taken it !
well , after her !
you pack of ingrates !
the oars have gone missing .
find them !
you .
you' re supposed to be dead !
am i not ?
parley ?
that' s the one .
parley !
parley !
parley ?
damned to the depths whatever muttonhead thought up parley ?
that would be the french .
not more pirates .
welcome aboard , miss elizabeth .
mr. gibbs ?
hey , boy !
where be jack ?
jack ?
jack sparrow ?
he fell behind .
keep to the code .
weigh anchor !
hoist the sails !
make quickly .
how the blazes did you get off that island ?
when you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land , you forgot one very important thing mate ...
i' m captain jack sparrow .
ah , well , i won' t be making that mistake again .
gents , you all remember captain jack sparrow ?
yeah !
kill him !
the girl' s blood didn' t work , did it ?
hold your fire !
you know whose blood we need ?
i know whose blood ye need .
what sort of a man trades a man' s life for a ship ?
pirate .
here , let me .
thank you .
you said you gave barbossa my name as yours .
why ?
i don' t know .
i' m sorry .
blacksmith' s hands , i know they' re rough .
no ... i mean yes , they are but ...
... but don' t stop .
elizabeth ...
it' s yours .
i thought i' d lost it the day they rescued me .
it was a gift from my father , he sent it to me .
why did you take it ?
because i was afraid that you were a pirate .
that would' ve been awful .
it wasn' t your blood they needed ... it was my father' s blood ... my blood .
the blood of a pirate .
i' m so sorry , please forgive me .
so you expect to leave me standing on some beach with nothing but a name and your word ... ... it' s the one i need and watch you sail away on my ship ?
no .
i expect to leave you standing on some beach with absolutely no name ... ... at all , watching me sail away on my ship and then i' il shout the name back to you .
savvy ?
but that still leaves us with the problem of me standing on some beach with naught ... but a name and your word it' s the one i need .
of the two of us i am the only one who hasn' t committed mutiny .
therefore my word is the one we' il be trusting .
although , i suppose i should be thanking you because in fact ... ... if you hadn' t betrayed me and left me to die ... ... i would have an equal share in that curse same as you .
funny ol ' world , innit ?
captain , we' re coming up on the interceptor .
i' m having a thought here , barbossa .
what say we run up a flag of truce ?
i scurry over to the interceptor ... ... and i negotiate the return of your medallion , aye ?
what say you to that ?
now you see , jack , that' s exactly the attitude that lost you the pearl .
people are easy to search when they' re dead .
lock him in the brig !
hands aloft to loose t' gallants .
with this wind she' il carry every sail we' ve got .
what' s happening ?
the black pearl , she' s gaining on us .
this is the fastest ship in the caribbean .
you can tell them that after they' ve caught us .
we' re shallow on the draft , right ?
aye .
well , then can' t we lose them amongst those shoals ?
we don' t have to outrun them long , just long enough .
lighten the ship , stem to stern .
anything that we can afford to lose ... see that it' s lost !
apparently there' s a leak .
haul on the main brace .
make ready the guns .
and run out the sweeps .
we' re gonna need that .
it was a good plan up ' till now .
gibbs !
we have to make a stand .
we must fight !
load the guns !
with what ?
anything .
everything !
anything we have left .
load the guns !
take shot and langrage .
nails and crushed glass !
with a will !
the pearl is going to luff up on our port quarter .
she' il rake us without ever presenting a target .
lower the anchor on the right side .
on the starboard side !
it certainly has the element of surprise .
you' re daft , lady !
you both are !
daft like jack .
lower the starboard anchor !
do it ye dogs or it' s you we' il load into the cannons !
let go !
they' re clubhaulin ' !
hard aport .
rack the starboard oars !
hard aport !
keep us steady now !
now !
fire !
fire !
stop blowing holes in my ship !
we could use a few more ideas , lass !
your turn !
we need us a devil' s dowry .
we' il give them her .
she' s not what they' re after .
the medallion .
strike yer colors ya bloomin ' cockroaches .
hands !
grapples , at the ready .
prepare to board !
koehler and twigg go to the powder magazine !
and the rest of you bring me the medallion !
hey !
below !
thanks very much .
jack !
bloody empty .
that' s not very nice .
where' s the medallion ?
wretch !
ah , where' s dear william ?
will .
will !
elizabeth !
monkey !
i can' t move it !
elizabeth !
why thank you , jack .
you' re welcome .
not you .
we named the monkey jack .
gents , our hope is restored !
yeah !
if any of you so much as thinks the word parley , i' il have your guts for garters .
will ...
you ve got to stop it !
stop it !
welcome back , miss .
you took advantage of our hospitality last time .
it holds fair now that you return the favor .
barbossa !
will .
she goes free !
what' s in your head , boy ?
she goes free !
you' ve only got one shot and we can' t die .
don' t do anything stupid .
you can' t ... i can .
like that .
who are you ?
no one .
he' s no one .
a distant cousin of my aunt' s nephew twice removed .
lovely singing voice , though .
eunuch .
my name is will turner .
my father was bootstrap bill turner .
his blood runs in my veins .
he' s a spitting image of ol ' bootstrap bill come back to haunt us .
on my word do as i say or i' il pull this trigger ... and be lost to davy jones ' locker .
name your terms , mr. turner .
elizabeth goes free .
yes , we know that one .
anything else ?
and the crew , the crew are not to be harmed .
agreed .
go on !
walk the plank !
barbossa , you lying bastard !
you swore she' d go free !
don' t dare impugn me honor , boy .
i agreed she' d go free it was you who failed ... ... to specify when or where .
though it does seem a shame to lose something so fine , don' t it lads ?
so i' il be having that dress back before you go .
i always liked you .
it goes with your black heart .
ooh , it' s still warm .
off you go !
come on !
too long !
i really had rather hoped we were past all this .
jack .
jack !
did ya not notice ?
that be the same little island that we made you governor of on our last little trip .
i did notice .
perhaps you' il be able to conjure up another miraculous escape .
but i doubt it .
off you go .
last time you left me a pistol with one shot .
by the powers , you' re right .
were be jack' s pistol ?
bring it forward .
seeing as there' s two of us , a gentleman would give us a pair of pistols .
it' il be one pistol as before and you can be the gentleman ... ... and shoot the lady and starve to death yourself .
that' s the second time i' ve had to watch that man sail away with my ship .
but you were marooned on this island before , weren' t you ?
so we can escape in the same way you did then .
to what point and purpose , young missy ?
the black pearl is gone .
and unless you have a rudder and a lot of sails hidden in that bodice ... unlikely , young mr. turner will be dead long before you can reach him .
but you' re captain jack sparrow .
you vanished from under the eyes of 7 agents of the east india company .
you sacked nassau port without even firing a shot .
are you the pirate i' ve read about or not ?
how did you escape last time ?
last time ... i was here a grand total of three days , alright ?
last time ... ... the rumrunners used this island as a cache .
came by and i was able to barter a passage off .
from the looks of things , they' ve long been out of business .
probably have your bloody friend norrington to thank for that .
so that' s it then ?
that' s the secret grand adventure of the infamous jack sparrow ?
you spent three days lying on a beach , drinking rum ?
welcome to the caribbean , love .
we' re devils and black sheep and really bad eggs .
drink up me ' earties yo ho !
yo ho yo ho a pirate' s life for me !
i love this song !
really bad eggs !
when i get the pearl back , i' m gonna teach it to the whole crew .
and we' il sing it all the time .
and you' il be positively the most fearsome pirate in the spanish main .
not just the spanish main , love .
the entire ocean ... the entire world .
wherever we want to go , we' il go .
that' s what a ship is , you know .
it' s not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails that' s what a ship needs ... but what a ship is ... what the black pearl really is ... ... is freedom .
jack ... it must be really terrible for you to be trapped on this island .
oh , yes .
but the company is infinitely better than last time , i think .
and the scenery has definitely improved .
mr. sparrow , i' m not entirely sure that i' ve ... ... had enough rum to allow that kind of talk .
i know exactly what you mean , love .
to freedom !
to the black pearl .
no !
not good !
stop !
not good !
what are you doing ?
you burned all the food , the shade , the rum !
yes , the rum is gone .
why is the rum gone ?
one , because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into complete scoundrels .
two , that signal is over a thousand feet high .
the entire royal navy is out looking for me .
do you really think that there is even the slightest chance that they won' t see it ?
but why is the rum gone ?
just wait , captain sparrow .
you give it one hour , maybe two , keep a weather eye open and you will see ... ... white sails on that horizon .
must' ve been terrible for you to be trapped here , jack .
must' ve been terrible for you ...
well it bloody is now !
there' il be no living with her after this .
but we' ve got to save will !
no !
you' re safe now .
we will return to port royal immediately not go gallivanting after pirates .
then we condemn him to death .
the boy' s fate is regrettable .
but then so is his decision to engage in piracy .
to rescue me , to prevent anything from happening to me !
if i may be so bold as to interject my professional opinion .
the pearl was listing near to scuppers after the battle .
it' s very unlikely she' il be able to make good time .
think about it .
the black pearl .
the last real pirate threat in the caribbean , mate .
how can you pass that up ?
by remembering that i serve others , mr. sparrow , not only myself .
commodore , i beg you , please do this .
for me ... as a wedding gift .
elizabeth .
are you accepting the commodore' s proposal ?
i am .
a wedding !
i love weddings , drinks all around !
i know .
clap him in irons , right ?
mr. sparrow .
you will accompany these fine men to the helm and provide us ... ... with the bearing to isla de muerta .
you will then spend the rest of the voyage contemplating all possible meanings of the phrase ...
silent as the grave " .
do i make myself clear ?
inescapably clear .
shiver me timbers .
cotton ' ere says you missed a bit .
you knew william turner ?
ol ' bootstrap bill ... we knew him .
never sat well with bootstrap what we did to jack sparrow .
the mutiny and all .
he said it wasn' t right with the code .
that' s why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you as it were .
he said we deserved to be cursed ... ... and remain cursed .
stupid blighter good man .
but as you can imagine ... that didn' t sit too well with the captain .
that didn' t sit too well with the captain , at all .
tell him what barbossa did .
i' m telling the story !
so ... what the captain did ... he strapped a cannon to bootstraps ' bootstraps .
the last we saw of ol ' bill turner ... he was sinking to the crushing black oblivion of davy jones ' locker .
' course it was only after that ... we learned we needed his blood to lift the curse .
that' s what you call ironic .
bring him !
i don' t care for the situation .
any attempt to storm the cave could turn to an ambush .
not if you' re the one doing the ambushing .
i go in to convince barbossa to send his men out in their little boats .
you and your mates return to the dauntless and blast the bejesus outta them with your little cannons , aye ?
what do you have to lose ?
nothing i' d lament being rid of .
now , to be quite honest with you ... there' s still a slight risk for those aboard the dauntless which includes the future mrs. commodore .
sorry , but for your own safety .
i don' t care what the commodore ordered , i have to tell him .
the pirates ... they cannot be killed !
don' t worry , miss , he' s already informed of that .
a little mermaid flopped up on deck and told him the whole story .
this is jack sparrow' s doing .
no reason to fret , it' s just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood .
no mistakes this time .
he' s only half turner .
we spill it all .
guess there is reason to fret .
beg your pardon .
begun by blood ...
excuse me . ... by blood un ...
jack !
it' s not possible .
not probable .
where' s elizabeth ?
she' s safe , just like i promised .
she' s all set to marry norrington , just like she promised .
and you get to die for her , just like you promised
so we' re all men of our word really .
except for elizabeth who is , in fact , a woman .
shut up !
you' re next !
you don' t want to be doing that , mate .
no , i really think i do .
your funeral .
why don' t i want to be doing it ?
well , because ...
because the hms dauntless , pride of the royal navy ... is floating just offshore ... waiting for you .
what are we doing here ?
pirates come out ... unprepared and unawares .
we catch them in the crossfire ... send them down to see old hobb .
i know why we' re here .
i mean ... why aren' t we doing what it was what mr. sparrow said we should do .
with the cannons and all .
because it was mr. sparrow who said it .
you think he wasn' t telling the truth ?
just hear me out , mate .
you order your men to row out to the dauntless , they do what they do best .
robert' s your uncle fannie' s your aunt , there you are with two ships .
the makings of your very own fleet .
' course you' il take the grandest as your flagship and who' s to argue ?
but what of the pearl ?
name me captain .
i' il sail under your colors , i' il give you ten percent of me plunder ... ... and you get to introduce yourself as ... ... commodore barbossa .
savvy ?
i suppose in exchange you want me not to kill the whelp .
no , no , not at all by all means , kill the whelp .
just not yet .
wait to lift the curse ... until the opportune moment .
for instance ... after you' ve killed norrington' s men ... every ... last ... one .
you' ve been planning this from the beginning .
ever since you learned my name .
yeah .
i want fifty percent of your plunder .
15 !
40 !
25 !
and i' il buy you the hat !
a really big one ...
commodore .
we have an accord .
all hand' s to the boats !
apologies , you give the orders .
gents !
take a walk !
not to the boats ?
hold fire !
this is just like what the greeks done at troy .
except they was in a horse instead of dresses .
wooden horse .
a moment , please .
elizabeth ?
i just want you to know i ... i believe you made a very good decision today .
couldn' t be more proud of you .
but you know , even a good decision if made for the wrong reasons ... ... can be a wrong decision .
lieutenant ?
elizabeth ?
are you there ?
elizabeth , are you even listening to me ?
oh , what have you done ?
stop that !
i already feel like a fool .
you look nice , though .
i look nice ?
i must admit , jack , i thought i had ye figured .
it turns out that you' re a hard man to predict .
me ?
i' m dishonest , and a dishonest man you can always trust to be ... ... dishonest .
honestly .
it' s the honest ones you want to watch out for .
because you can never predict when they' re going to do something incredibly ... ... stupid .
you' re off the edge of the map , mate .
here there be monsters .
roger that .
what would you pick to eat first ?
i think we should decide now .
just so we' re ready when the time comes .
what was that ?
it' s elizabeth !
make for the ship !
move !
you can' t beat me jack .
that' s interesting .
couldn' t resist , mate .
sorry .
so what now , jack sparrow ?
will it be two immortals locked in ... an epic battle until judgment day and trumpets sound ?
or you could surrender .
all of you with me .
will is in that cave and we must save him .
ready ?
and heave !
please , i need your help , come on !
any port in the storm .
cotton' s right , we' ve got the pearl .
what about jack , you' re just going to leave him ?
jack owes us a ship .
there' s the code to consider the code ?
you' re pirates , hang the code and hang the rules .
they' re more like guidelines anyway .
bloody pirates !
oy .
what ?
is it supposed to be doing that ?
they' re stealing our ship .
bloody pirates !
come on !
ah , me eye !
i' m gonna teach you the meaning of pain .
you like pain ?
try wearing a corset .
whose side is jack on ?
at the moment ?
no fair .
ten years you carry that pistol and now you waste your shot .
he didn' t waste it .
i feel ...
... cold .
parley ?
the ship is ours , gentlemen .
we should return to the dauntless .
your fianc will be wanting to know you' re safe .
if you were waiting for the opportune moment ... ... that was it .
now if you' il be so kind , i' d be much obliged if you' d drop me off my ship .
i' m sorry , jack .
they done what' s right by them .
can' t expect more than that .
jack sparrow ...
captain .
captain jack sparrow . ... for your willful commission of crimes against the crown .
said crimes being numerous in quantity and sinister in nature .
piracy , smuggling ...
this is wrong .
commodore norrington is bound by the law .
as are we all . ... impersonating an officer of the spanish royal navy ... ... impersonating a cleric of the church of england ... ... sailing under false colors , arson , kidnapping , looting , poaching ... ... brigandage , pilfering , depravity , depredation and general lawlessness .
and for these crimes you have been sentenced to be on this day ... ... hung by the neck until dead .
may god have mercy on your soul .
governor swann .
commodore .
elizabeth .
i should have told you every day from the moment i met you ...
i love you .
marines .
can' t breathe .
elizabeth .
move !
i thought we might have to endure some manner of ill conceived escape attempt ... ... but not from you .
on our return to port royal , i granted you clemency .
and this is how you thank me ?
by throwing in your lot with him ?
he' s a pirate .
and a good man .
if all i have achieved here is that the hangman will earn two pairs ... of boots instead of one , so be it .
at least my conscience will be clear .
you forget your place , turner .
it' s right here , between you and jack .
as is mine .
elizabeth .
lower your weapons !
for goodness ' sake put them down !
so this is where your heart truly lies , then ?
it is .
well !
i' m actually feeling rather good about this .
i think we' ve all arrived at a very special place , eh ?
spiritually , ecumenically , grammatically .
i want you to know that i was rooting for you , mate .
know that .
elizabeth ... it would never have worked between us , darling .
i' m sorry .
will ... nice hat .
men !
this is the day that you will always remember as the day that you ...
idiot .
he has nowhere to go but back to the noose .
sail ho !
what' s your plan of action ?
sir ?
perhaps on the rare occasion , pursuing the right course ... ... demands an act of piracy ... piracy itself can be the right course ?
mr. turner .
i will accept the consequences of my actions .
this is a beautiful sword .
i would expect the man who made it to show the same care and ... ... devotion in every aspect of his life .
thank you .
commodore !
what about sparrow ?
well , i think we can afford to give him one day' s head start .
so , this is the path you' ve chosen , is it ?
after all ... he is a blacksmith .
no .
he' s a pirate .
i thought you were supposed to keep to the code .
we figured they were more actual ... guidelines .
thank you .
captain sparrow .
... the black pearl is yours .
on deck you scabrous dogs !
man the braces !
now ... bring me that horizon .
and really bad eggs .
drink up , me ' arties yo ho .
