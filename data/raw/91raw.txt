don' t stress .
just relax .
i understand you can lose keys .
you can lose your wallet .
how do you lose a plane ?
reese , what do you want me to do ?
we got three out of four planes in .
that' s a lot of coke .
now , that' s the kind of winning attitude that' il take this enterprise to the top .
in all fairness , reese , it wasn' t his fault .
are you his attorney ?
why are you in the conversation ?
come on , i' m kidding !
i' m just kidding with you .
he loves to joke .
terrence here is absolutely right .
i mean , hell , three out of four ain' t bad .
let' s celebrate .
who wants a beer ?
great !
okay .
baby !
coke .
it costs money .
planes .
they cost money .
this yacht , this perm , my kid' s braces , it all costs money .
do you think kitty' s free ?
kitty , turn around .
turn around !
reese , please put the gun down .
now , the next time that a plane goes down , you better be on it .
will you do my back , please ?
sure .
i don' t wanna tan weird .
am i tanning weird ?
no .
honestly .
you' re bronzing .
there' s no such thing as a petty crime .
no minor infractions .
there' s only the law .
freeze !
bay city p. d. !
that' s me in the leather jacket and tight jeans .
see that guy i' m chasing ?
i hate him .
and i' il do everything in my power to stop him .
wanna play , let' s play .
because it' s my job to stop him .
goddamn !
and the city pays me a damn good salary to do my job .
besides , he crossed the line .
and in bay city , when you cross the line ...
... your nuts are mine .
i said , freeze !
my name is david starsky , and i' m a cop .
if you can' t beat them , join them .
no !
no !
no !
put the money in there .
crime .
not me , though .
i' m looking out for numero uno .
hey , old timer .
put this on dallas .
come on !
let' s go !
i' m just a realist , that' s all .
and besides , you have any idea how little the city pays us ?
freeze !
bay city p. d. !
take it easy .
guys , come on .
i' m undercover here .
my name is ken hutchinson , and i' m a cop .
where did they come from ?
jesus christ , starsky .
you fired three rounds into a crowded intersection .
we got a man with a broken hip ... ... and some asshole wants a new top for his caddy ?
that purse had $ 7 in it .
okay , want my badge ?
here , take it .
fine .
come on .
i was just making a point .
david , david .
your mother was one of the finest cops bay city ever seen .
twenty two years on the force with the same partner .
you have had 12 partners over the past four years .
she died a legend .
i am not my mother !
i' m sorry .
detective hutchinson is here .
send him in .
have a seat .
how you doing , captain ?
i believe you two know each other .
yeah , a little bit .
how you doing ?
yeah , right .
hutch .
you' ve got a lot of explaining to do .
i know .
look , i was trying to infiltrate one of the east side gangs ... ... and work my way up to the big fish .
it' s simple .
you were robbing a bookie .
that' s right .
you' ve robbed seven bookies .
you haven' t filed a report , turned in any money or arrested anybody .
how can i ?
they' il know i' m a cop .
i wouldn' t worry , you won' t be mistaken for a real cop .
oh , really ?
why don' t you go get yourself another perm and let the grownups talk .
my hair is naturally curly .
no , it' s not .
yes , it is .
that' s a perm job , all the way .
touch it !
hey !
why are you touching him ?
jesus !
you know something ?
you two deserve each other .
make nice .
you' re partners .
you' re crazy .
no , i' m not .
i don' t know why you' re so upset .
the guy cost us 200 grand .
a " thank you " might be more appropriate .
who cares about 200 grand ?
what if they link us to the murder ?
they won' t link us to the murder .
you don' t know that .
will you let it go , please ?
jesus .
take a lude .
calm down .
i did , and i' m still pissed .
okay , fine .
fine , fine .
look , i' m sorry , all right ?
i promise , i' m not gonna kill terrence again .
now , pull it together .
let' s go .
gentlemen , i apologize about the delay .
but i promise you what we have is worth the wait .
it looks like cocaine .
that' s because it is cocaine .
with a twist .
you see , we' ve managed to find a way ... ... to alter the cell structure of the coca plant ... ... giving it a heightened perfluoralkylation process ... ... creating a new kind of diazomethane .
gets a little complicated after that .
excuse me .
so do you get extra high or what ?
actually , it has all the same effects as regular cocaine .
well , if it' s the same , why are we here ?
canis familiaris .
the german shepherd .
its nose has over 220 million scent receptors .
it can detect smells that even the most advanced technology in the world cannot .
lvan , search !
lvan , stop !
what do you got ?
you holding ?
he brought old coke .
this is new coke .
as far as a dog' s concerned , there' s nothing there .
100 percent undetectable cocaine .
got no coke smell ... ... same coke ride .
tastes kind of sweet .
if this shit wasn' t illegal , guys , we' d be up for the nobel prize .
our initial run pumped out two tons of this stuff ... ... and it' il be available in about three weeks .
you boys know who to call .
ivan !
you don' t understand .
they' re not like you .
they' re criminals .
look , i know we all got to make living .
but these guys , they are dealing hard drugs right in front of my shop .
i can dig what you' re saying , mr. chowdury .
i wanna thank you for coming in today .
of course .
those gentlemen you speak of , they' il no longer be a problem .
you have my word .
this is my neighborhood .
people tend to forget that .
bee bee , make sure he gets home safely .
yeah , boss .
thank you very much , huggy .
you are a great man .
begone , little indian .
let' s go , little man .
come on .
taking up time .
this neighborhood is in need of some help .
it' s cold blooded , daddy .
who' s next ?
you got hutch waiting outside .
what you got my man waiting outside for ?
he brought some extra fuzz with him .
so what ?
you go get him and get him in here now .
you' ve never run an errand on the clock before ?
i take care of my personal business after work , when the taxpayers aren' t paying me .
give me a break .
you' ve never stopped to buy a cup of coffee ?
i bring a thermos .
okay , hutch .
he' il see you now .
wait here , i' il be back in five minutes .
second door on the right .
how you doing ?
hi , hutch .
hey , look what the wind blew in .
huggy bear .
hey , i want you to meet my new partner , david starsky .
hey , how you doing ?
hey , nobody touches the bear .
have a seat .
hutch , the usual ?
you know it .
make it a double .
get my boy a jack and tab .
and double that .
you got it , boss .
i' il get a seltzer with lime , if you got it .
i don' t got it .
or not .
it' s cool .
i' m good .
i just came by to apologize for what happened in chinatown .
let me tell you , i was as surprised as you were .
don' t sweat it , baby .
i wasn' t surprised .
you know i ain' t never surprised .
hey , champ .
you got a permit for that weapon you' re carrying ?
starsky , please .
no , i don' t .
yeah , me neither .
i' m sorry , did i say something that was funny ?
stop it .
he' s kidding .
no , i' m not kidding .
i wanna see permits or i' m taking those weapons .
slow up , man .
around here , we govern ourselves .
think of us like luxembourg .
you dig ?
no , i don' t dig .
see , luxembourg' s a constitutional monarchy ... ... a sovereign state established after the treaty of vienna .
technically , it' s a part of europe .
but in reality , they govern themselves .
like us .
just like us .
all right , enough , okay ?
shit !
hold up !
hold up !
just chill out !
chill !
watch yourself .
oh , no .
hell , no .
you okay ?
what happened ?
did he shoot corky ?
your boy shot his tail off .
he lost his tail ?
you should keep it in a terrarium .
man , what the hell is a terrarium ?
what' s a terrarium ?
it' s an artificial ecosystem designed to simulate corky' s natural habitat .
well , i can dig that .
but i say we shoot him in the ass .
oh , hell , yeah .
an eye for an eye .
take it easy .
huggy , help me out here .
slow up , fellas .
an iguana can lose his tail and grow it back .
he regenerates .
that' s how he escapes his predator .
it' s true .
it' s a defense mechanism .
i read it in a magazine .
so him shooting corky' s tail off and us shooting him in the ass ... ... it really ain' t the same thing .
no , the punishment don' t fit the crime .
and besides , it was an accident , right ?
right .
so we' re cool .
we' re always cool , breeze .
lower your pieces .
good morning , bay city , you are tuned in to kba y , 93 . 3 on your dial .
this next tune is number eight on the charts and number one in our hearts .
hey , hutch !
oh , there he is .
what' s going on , willis ?
same old , same old .
so how' s life at the clink treating you ?
it' s not that great .
i got some new tight ass partner that they stuck me with and then ...
i don' t know .
hopefully ...
it' s probably not gonna last that long .
so got that $20 you owe me ?
20 ?
willis , i thought it was 5 .
hutch , that was my grandmother' s birthday money .
come on , give me a break , okay ?
i just told you i got a new partner .
stuff isn' t great for me down at the precinct .
you know , back off for a second .
can i get it to you on thursday ?
fine , but no later than thursday .
no later than thursday .
word of honor .
cute little kid .
it' s 10 : 00 .
you' re late .
i' ve been here since 8 .
8 : 00 ?
i didn' t know this place opened at 8 .
well , don' t sweat it , because crime called in sick .
it' s gonna get a late start too .
crime called in sick , " i like that .
so , what' s on the agenda today ?
same as every day .
finding bad guys , bringing them down .
great .
take my car , right there .
that ?
yeah .
what the hell is that ?
it' s like a camper/ pickup truck .
what' s the matter ?
we' re undercover .
that thing sticks out like a sore thumb .
you think so ?
you' re in for a treat .
it' s not that bad .
man , your stock just went up in my book , my friend .
pop the hood .
let' s see what you got under ...
hotshot , what do you think you' re doing ?
this is a ford gran torino , okay ?
it' s not some crappy camper/ apartment .
there are rules .
okay , okay .
you do not bang on the hood .
you never , under any circumstances , drive .
you will not put your coffee mug on the roof .
okay ?
no coffee in the car whatsoever .
coffee on the ground , you get in the car , we go .
attention , all units .
we' ve got a 61 40 at bay city marina .
oh , no .
this is zebra 3 .
we' re on it .
hang on .
you gotta be kidding me .
no way .
what ?
floater .
nothing harder to solve than a floater .
no prints , body' s usually bloated ... ... it' s next to impossible .
all right , i say we push it out ... ... hope the current takes it to the next precinct .
what ?
you' il thank me for this one .
hey , seriously , stop it .
the key is not to pop it .
hey .
you gotta be very ginger .
what are you doing ?
i said , drop the stick .
you point a gun at me ?
okay , fine , have it your way .
knock yourself out .
what are you gonna solve , anyway ?
i' m gonna solve a murder .
monday , june 3rd .
male caucasian body , apparently dumped from the bay bridge .
actually , there' s no sign of impact , so he was probably just dropped out at sea .
could you please not talk while i' m recording ?
thank you .
all right , i' m just gonna call in the meat wagon , all right ?
looks like you punched your last ticket , amigo .
i' m sorry , did you just tough talk a dead body ?
i lost my flow .
zebra 3 to base .
dispatch .
go ahead , zebra 3 .
we' re gonna need a coroner notification .
we got a db down at municipal jetty .
10 4 , will inform .
tell them to bring a body bag and some galoshes .
he' s a wet one .

nothing in it .
medium rare , okay ?

zebra 3 .
2 11 in progress , please respond .
go for starsky .
hurry , starsky .
we got two perps holding up a gumball machine on 5th street .
let' s go .
a gumball machine ?
lethal force if necessary !
very funny , manetti .
hey , it' s captain and tennille .
that means one of you would actually have to make captain .
radio' s for police business only .
that' s true .
why' d they give you one ?
let' s get out of here .
not that funny .
that manetti really thinks he' s something .
but you know what ?
he' s not .
take it easy .
you think that' s funny ?
no , no , i mean , you just gotta rise above it .
what do we got in the wallet ?
not much .
driver' s license , couple receipts .
no cash whatsoever .
reese feldman corporation .
what do you call that ?
terrence meyers .
that name does sound vaguely familiar .
isn' t he part of our nearly there program ?
i think he is .
terrence meyers .
baby , isn' t he the guy dating a bay city kitty ?
remember ?
we were joking about it .
really ?
bay city kitty .
you mean the cheerleaders .
you happen to remember her name ?
no , i don' t .
can i get you boys anything else ?
we' re good .
thank you so much , honey .
that' s my angel .
i love her .
a second ago you mentioned the nearly there foundation .
what is that ?
that' s a program that we set up to help ex cons get back on their feet .
their parole requires them to have a job .
the catch 22 ... ... is not that many people are excited to hire a felon .
those poor ex cons , they can' t catch a break .
no , it' s a vicious cycle they get caught up in .
did you see the article in the new times ?
bet your ass i did .
i love that writer .
but i' d be lying if i didn' t say that we get some pretty good tax breaks too .
there it is , the kicker .
just a perk .
this sly dog here .
what do you got ?
tickets to our annual fundraiser .
be my guests .
no , we can' t accept gratuities .
it' s against policy .
these don' t look like gratuities , they look like tickets .
i' d be happy to accept .
hey , what about terrence ?
is he in some kind of trouble ?
he' s dead .
his body washed up in the marina this morning .
oh , no .
punched his last ticket , " as they say .
you know , you try to do all you can for these guys , but it' s just never enough , is it ?
no , i guess it isn' t .
when was the last time you saw him ?
the last place i saw ...
this is a nice boat .
reese , is this yours ?
actually , that' s a yacht .
i' m sorry , a yacht .
excuse me , hutch .
can we please focus on the investigation ?
sure .
thank you .
i could use another one of these .

yeah .

oh , yeah , heather dated him .
oh , yeah .
the girl over there with the yellow top .
but they split up .
we haven' t seen him .
let' s go ask heather some questions .
thank you .
be careful with those moves .
you could hurt someone .
oh , that' s why we practice .
actually , i was talking about us .
where did that come from ?
i would' ve tried the horoscope line .
no , too obvious .
hey !
wait up .
see what i mean ?
here' s my number .
in case you need us for ... ... questioning .

he was always fascinated by all that macho mobster bullshit .
i hope this is okay .
i need to make this quick .
i gotta pick my kid up in 20 minutes .
oh , yeah , totally .
we were gonna move in together .
he promised he' d quit ... ... that stuff after he got out .
but then he goes and gets himself killed .
he' s such an asshole .
i can only imagine what you must be going through .
i think that ...
honestly , you know , if i knew what he was up to , i' d be happy to tell you .
but we didn' t talk much .
yeah .
so did you ... ?
when did he ... ?
did he ... ?
what did ... ?
so hutch , do you got any more questions ?
yeah , well , sure .
we could ...
what' s your sign ?
gemini .

what does that have to do with anything ?
it has everything to do with anything .

around 115 , i guess , give or take a pound or two .
i wish i could be more helpful .
stop .

i know people that know people that robbed some people .
so , what do you hear on the street these days ?
dig this .
a little bird tells me there' s gonna be a big coke deal in bay city .
one for the guinness books , so they say .
interesting .
who would this little bird be ?
look , i lay it out for y' all to play it out .
all right .
what does that mean ?
don' t worry about it .
huggy , what can you tell us about this ?
this looks like the work of big earl .
this boy loves dragons .
he makes these with his hands , you know ?
there' s his name stitched right up under the dragon' s belly .
big earl ?
yeah , he sews , but he' s one tough mother .
he owns a biker bar about 80 miles east of route 4 .
biker bar ?

what do you got on those cops ?
everything .
records , home addresses , credit history .
nice .
starsky and hutchinson ?
they call him hutch , actually .
i don' t have enough on my plate already ?
i got a major coke deal , my daughter' s bat mitzvah , which is a total nightmare .
and now these two guys .
you think they' re on to us ?
they are investigating a murder .
that' s what cops do .
it' s why we pay taxes .
you' re the worst .
you kidding ?
will you look at these two guys ?
he' s cute , the blond .
but i like dark hair .
maybe we ought to push this whole thing .
till things cool off ?
kevin , please , with the worry .
we' re moving ahead as scheduled .
i' il handle those two clowns .
so tomorrow , i say we check out this biker bar , do a little deep cover .
sounds good .
who does your wig work ?
i' m sorry , my what ?
your wig work .
your undercover work , your disguises .
you have a wig guy ?
oh , yeah , he' s incredible .
well , if it isn' t sonny and cher .
sonny and cher .
sit on it , manetti .
me sit on it ?
yeah , you , sit on it .
why don' t you sit on it , starsky , how' s that sound ?
you wish .
because i' m never sitting on it , ever .
that' s not what i heard .
starsky !
come on .
come on !
jesus !

what the hell is going on ?
cool your jets , starsky !
everybody , back off !
including you , manetti .
i apologize , captain .

and for the record ... ... those are hand towels .
the big towels are on the top shelf .
hand towels .
what a rod .
jesus christ .
he' s right .
go cover up .
who are you guys ?
my name' s kansas .
and this is my little man toto .
we' re jesters from up in big cliff , coming down and check out your place .
this it ?
is this your place ?
yeah .
nice .
tell me , if you two are jesters , what' s our credo ?
credo .
well ...
you almost got me there .
there' s no credo .
other than the secret credo .
it ain' t no secret .
it' s written right on our damn crest .
a trick question ?
if it' s printed on the crest , you don' t give it as a test .
anybody can read the crest .
that wouldn' t prove we' re jesters .
not cool .
that' s a fake mustache .
oh , really ?
well , i wonder if you think this is fake .
now , we got some questions !
i don' t gotta give you nothing , cop !
wrong !
first , you' ve gotta give me a little respect .
second , you' re gonna give me some answers , comprende , muchacho ?
i like your style .
i like your moves .
now , where were we ?
you were gonna tell us about terrence meyers .
who' s terrence meyers ?
wrong answer , big earl .
big earl ?
i' m not big earl .
i' m jeff .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
jeff ?
no one' s who they say they are .
look .
honest , think about it .
i' m not even big .
yeah .
no , that' s a good point .
maybe it' s an ironic name , like tiny over in vice .
he' s , like , 8 feet tall .
everybody says he' s tiny ...
i know , except this guy' s normal size .
he' d have to be a lot smaller for a name like big earl to be ironic .
you don' t have to be a midget .
you' re not exactly ...
how tall are you ?
i don' t know , 5' 9 " ?
well , that is kind of ...
basically ...
borderline .
it' s average .
look .
big earl got pinched two weeks ago .
he' s in bay city correctional .
i took over the bar till he gets out .
jeff , i' m sorry .
we apologize .
we' re gonna pay big earl a visit .
let me get this for you .
there you go .
good as new .
next time you watch a place ... ... don' t claim you own it because you watch it .
i housesit for my sister all the time , it' s not like i claim that i own her house .
that goes for all y' all .
don' t pretend to be something you' re not .
just be who you are .
that' s what' s really cool .
how did you get in ?
visiting hours are over .
special treatment .
we got some questions about terrence meyers .
terrence meyers ?
yeah .
you made this jacket for him ?
gee whiz , i don' t seem to know anyone by that name at all .
hard customer .
offer him a radio or some bullshit .
maybe we can make your stay a little more comfortable .
nice transistor radio for your cell ?
no .
how about a tv ?
i tell you what .
i do like your blonde friend , here .
let me see your bellybutton .
no .
what ...
let' s go .
come on .
no , listen .
no , no !
i' m not ...
hold on .
he' s obviously a freak .
just show him a little skin .
show him your stomach .
nobody' s here .
come on .
are we cool ?
yes , we' re cool .
oh , eureka .
god , that' s nice .
it' s like a little bowl of oatmeal with a hole in it .
i got one too .
oh , come on .
i just got a little more brown sugar on mine .
did you say " terrence meyers " ?
yeah , i think i did make that jacket .
we might have pulled a job together .
what job ?
who were you working for ?
stand up .
walk to the back and do a spin for me .
wait a second .
i just showed you my stomach ...
come on , a deal' s a deal , earl .
fine , then this conversation is over .
wait .
wait .
hold it .
come on .
wait .
i can' t hear you .
get up .
tell him to take his jacket off .
take your jacket off .
slow spin .
he says to do a slow spin .
tell him to arch his back and then look back at me , mean .
like a dragon .
he says to arch your back and look back at him , mean , like a dragon .
but keep it mean .
tell him great job .
he can sit down .
you' re a very convincing dragon .
you should feel good about that .
just get this over with .
okay , here' s the deal .
terrence and i worked as extra muscle for a couple of dealers .
i' d like to tell you who , but i don' t know .
i never got a name , i never got a face .
they paid us in coke .
i was pretty pissed at the time .
i was hoping to get cash .
i' m no coke dealer .
right , so where' s the coke ?
if we find that coke , we can probably trace it .
fine .
fine .
look , i like you guys , okay ?
especially you .
okay ?
don' t feel bad about that .
but i like you guys , so i' il tell you .
but ...
but first i need to see something , okay ?
and it' s gonna involve both of you .
i' m not gonna lie to you .
it' s gonna get weird .
two dragons .
ready ?
both of you , take your shirts off .
but do it slow .
i guess it' s supposed to rain later tonight .
yeah , that' s what i heard .
look , you know , what happened ...
can we please not talk about this , hutch ?
we got the coke .
let' s not ever talk about it .
you' re right .
that' s a good policy .
we got what we came for .
you think dragons ever ...
stop , i don' t want to talk about it !
what the hell is wrong with you two ?
come on , what are you ... ?
you have brought disgrace ... ... on everyone who' s ever worn a uniform .
my god .
we didn' t know there was a camera .
cap , we' re sorry .
at least we got the stash .
there' s gotta be 30 grams of coke here , minimum .
this could lead us to the dealers that iced terrence meyers .
it' s evidence .
we can print the bag , run forensics .
we did .
we got nothing .
what we got is a bag of artificial sweetener .
what are you talking about ?
my granny wouldn' t think this was coke .
come on , that' s impossible .
we got the stuff from big earl .
i' m taking you two off this floater .
what ?
i' m giving it to manetti .
manetti ?
oh , come on , cap !
manetti' s the worst cop on the force !
starsky .
stop .
go on , sit down .
come on .
look , captain , we' re sorry , but come on .
you can' t take us off this .
i just did .
now , leave .
and take your bag of artificial sweetener with you .
kicking the chair was a nice touch .
yeah , too bad it didn' t work .
he' il get over it .
what i can' t figure out is why earl got paid with bunk cocaine .
now we' ve got two leads .
we do ?
stacey and holly .
those two cheerleaders ?
no , no , those two witnesses .
they met terrence .
let' s take them out , see what we can learn .
i mean , is it our fault that they also happen to be a couple of hot foxes ?
reese , i couldn' t help myself .
they were cops .
they were just too macho .
macho ?
it' s simple .
you should have lied .
i did .
i lied about you .
i didn' t tell them anything .
but i had to give them something .
they were so pure .
you' re lucky you' re in the joint .
do you understand me ?
look at the bright side .
bright side ?
it' s the ultimate test .
the coke was in the police station .
they cleared it .
you should be happy .
well , guess what ?
i' m not happy .
i' m not happy at all about it , earl !
don' t shush me !
don' t tell me to calm down !
understand ?
what are you wearing ?

what am i wearing ?
silk flowered shirt and a vest .
why ?
that' s gorgeous .
you sick son of a bitch .
don' t hang up .
don' t hang up !
god .
some people .
i' m not gonna be able to fit in my uniform tomorrow .
is that a good or bad thing ?
is this the way you two always treat witnesses ?
well , that depends .
if it' s a misdemeanor , we' ve been known to skip the fondue ... ... and move right to foot massages .
let me see .
watch out !
wait a minute , i think that' s police brutality .
anybody for some coffee ?
no , thanks .
okay , one for le chef .
wow .

let' s get the cup out .
thank you , big earl .
do you ever get scared out there , on the streets ?
yeah .
i' d like to say no , but the truth is , i do sometimes .
i' m one of those guys that' s more about helping others than helping myself .
there we go .
it' s all i knew .
it' s more that there' s someone i might not be able to help .
a citizen that needs aid , or even an animal .

my attorney here would love to take them down , but i know ... ... that in the bottom of their hearts ... ... these two detectives were just trying to protect me and my family .
i gotcha .
thank you .
i respect your attitude , but you can be sure ... ... it will never happen again , because as of now ... ... both of you are suspended indefinitely .
look , cap , this was my fault .
don' t drag hutch into this .
i shot the pony .
you care what happens to hutch ?
you filed for transfer two weeks ago , citing his behavior as a reason .
captain ...
oh yeah , yeah .
check this out .
sounds like you' re quite the crime fighter , hutch .
you filed for a transfer ?
guns and badges , right here , on my desk .
your mother would be very disappointed in you .
man , i' ve really had it with that doby .
i mean , it' s enough already .
cavorting with nefarious characters .
conduct unbecoming of an officer .
i wrote that two weeks ago .
things are really cool with us now .
hey , did you go through my locker ?
no .
you went through my locker .
i might have looked inside ...
if you got a problem with someone , tell it to their face .
you come to them as a man .
you don' t go behind their back and write a thesis and try to get transferred .
backstabber !
yeah , don' t anybody work with david starsky .
he' il stab you in the back .
you' ve got to let this go .
we got lucky .
these guys screwed up .
they can' t even touch us now .
it is over .
i don' t care .
no one dresses as a mime and embarrasses me at my daughter' s bat mitzvah .
in my own house , no less .
have some perspective .
we' re almost finished .
we' re a few days from closing a $35 million deal .
let it slide .
yeah , i' il let it slide .
when they' re dead .
why did i get so lucky ?
i don' t know , i just love when you talk so tough .
of course you do .
that' s why you' re my girlfriend on the side .
hey , hutch .
ruin me !
excuse me , let me have a minute with my friend .
he didn' t care if he got ruined .
that was the whole point of the episode .
did you ... ?
hutch , you gonna have to lay up off of this juice .
you had too much to drink .
come on .
i feel like a million bucks .
just laughing , having a good time .
it ain' t even funny no more .

it' s gonna be tough .
the guy knows what we look like .
he doesn' t know what huggy bear looks like .
man , this is a bunch of crap .
i am an urban informant .
i am not a snitch .
come on , huggy , what' s the difference ?
a snitch wears a wire .
a snitch is the scum of the information industry .
a snitch has no soul .
damn , man , that shit hurt .
i' m sorry .
you got to be more careful .
we wouldn' t ask you to do this unless it was really important .
i' m gonna owe you one .

i mean , this is just the beginning .
we could go so far , honey .
i feel so exhilarated .

what have we here ?
now , that' s what i' m talking about .
we don' t really do private shows .
but i' m a good friend of huggy bear .
it' s kind of against cheerleading policy .
you need to change that policy .
you know what i can' t figure out ?
how the hell did you know to get on that boat ?
when your two boys put me on that undercover golf course mission ... ... that cat , reese ?
all he did was talk about that damn yacht .
and like i say , why go to the starting line when you can go straight to the finish ?
straight to the finish .
i like that , man .
i like that .
are you interested in doing any undercover work ?
not the least .
captain , let me borrow him for a second .
the weird thing is , one of those briefcases with $5 million just up and vanished .
oh , what is this , a brand new fur coat ?
look at this thing .
yeah , i inherited some money from a dead uncle of mine .
is that right ?
i didn' t even know you had an uncle .

i think he' s still upset about the car .
come on , let' s get up .
you' re going outside .
no , thanks .

we' re gonna get you cleaned up .
i don' t feel like it .
