thing of beauty .
good morning sir .
yet another on time delivery from ...
get the hell out of my face , canner .
have a nice day .
excuse , mr.
total performance , total readiness , total security ...
so goodbye to lengthy upgrades and service calls ...
an uplink to usr central computer provides this state of the art robot with new programs daily .
the nester class 5 is tomorrow' s robot today .
spoon , spooney !
hey !
hold on ...
excuse me
spoon , man , where you been at ?
just away , brother away ?
like vacation and stuff ... ? that' s real nice man ...
listen , i got a favor to ask .
i need to borrow the car for like 10 15 minutes ...
this is different , spoon .

i' ve got this fine ass little yummy , i mean , she is complete and agreeable ... ass hot sprinkable , spoon .
what does that even mean ?
you know what it means , man , ok now stop varicating .
first of all , stop cussing , because you' re not good at it .
let me get temp for the bus then, man .
i been there for you .
go home !
ok , that' s strike one , spoon .
you talked to marcy ?
no g. g. , i haven' t talked to marcy .
when i was comin' up we just didn' t marry someone then divorce them , then not talk to them .
del , don' t play with me .
i bet if i stopped cooking you' d call marcy .
boy , what is that on your feet ?
converse all stars , vintage 2004 .
don' t turn your face up like that , i know you want some .
all you gotta do is ask .
no , thank you very much .
mmm , sweat potato pie .
put that on a plate .
you know , i see on tv they given away some of them new robots in the lottery ?
you know g. g. , those robots don' t do anybody any good .
of all the people on god' s earth you should know better .
sometimes , the stuff that comes out of your mouth .
you listening to me , del ?
hold my pie .
sir , hold it or wear it .
hey !
move it !
thief !
stop !
stop !
i said ... stop !
relax , relax ...
i' m a police officer .
you ... are a asshole !
mam , is that your purse ?
of course it' s my purse !
i left my inhaler at home .
he was running it out to me !
i saw a robot running with the purse and naturally , i ... i assumed ...
what ?
are you crazy ?
i' m sorry for this misunderstanding , officer .
don' t apologize ... cause you' re doin ' what you supposed to be doin ' . but what do you do ?
have a lovely day , mam .
you lucky i can' t breathe or i' d walk all up and down your ass !
lead by example .
says that right on your badge .
so we gonna talk about this ?
about what ?
help , police ... that robot stole my dry cleaning .
oh , you want to talk about that ?
detective ... how many robots have ever snatched a purse ?
john , the thing is running down the str ...
how many robots in the world have ever committed a crime ?
now define crime !
answer my question , damn it .
none , john .
tell me what happened today .
nothing .
better be the last " nothing " .
spoon , are you sure you are ready to be back' cause you take the time ...
i' m fine , john
thank you .
better here than sittin ' around at home .
homicide ...
spooner .
please take the next exit , to your right .
welcome , detective spooner .
welcome at us robotics .
you have entered the garage level lobby .
please use the elevators for direct access to the main level concourse .
thank you .
good to see you again , son .
hello doctor .
everything that follows is a result of what you see here .
is there something you want tell me ?
i' m sorry .
my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
why did you call me ?
i trust your judgement .
normally , these circumstances wouldn' t require a homicide detective .
but then our interactions have never been nentirely normal .
wouldn' t you agree ?
you got that right .
is there something you want say to me ?
i' m sorry .
my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
why would you kill yourself ?
that , detective , the right question .
program terminated .
good afternoon , boys .
hey , detective .
enlighten me .
what you see is what you get .
massive impact trauma .
us robotics .
i gotta get my kids something .
anything upstairs ?
nada .
door was security locked from the inside .
wham , splat .
guy' s a jumper for sure .
ok guys , we gotta be smarter about this . let' s deal with this later .
detective .
lawrence robertson .
wow .
richest man in the world , i' ve seen you on television .
can i offer you a coffee ?
sure , why not ... it' s free , right ?
i don' t think anyone saw this coming .
i should have , i suppose , i knew him 20 years .
alfred practically invented robotics .
he wrote the three laws ...
but i guess brilliant people often have the most the most persuasive demons .
so , whatever i can do to help just ... sugar !
i' m sorry ?
for the coffee .
sugar ?
oh , you thought i was calling you " sugar " .
hey , you' re not that rich !
it' s on the table .
thank you .
when lanning fell , he was holding the , uh ... a little green ...
the holographic projector .
right , right .
why do you think lanning' s hologram would have called me ?
i assumed you knew him .
ya , i knew him .
holograms are very simple programs for just pre recorded responses ... designed to give the impression of intelligence .
apparently this one was programmed to call you upon his suicide .
death .
i' m sorry ?
the hologram , it was programmed to call me in the event of lanning' s death .
yes , suicide is a type of death , detective .
look , please don' t misunderstand my impatience oh , no ... go go go .
a really big week for you folks around here .
ya .
you gotta put a robot in every home .
look , this is not what i do , but ...
i got an idea for one of your commercials .
you can see a carpenter making a beautiful chair and one of your robots comes in and makes a better chair ... twice as fast .
and then you superimpose on the screen .
usr ... shittin ' on the little guy .
that would be the fade out .
i suppose your father lost his job to a robot . or maybe you would have simply banned the internet to keep the libraries open .
prejudice never shows much reason .
i suspect you simply don' t like their kind .
you got a business to run around here .
and the last you need , especially this week, is a dead guy in your lobby .
but hell , seeings that you got one , maybe i' il look around .
ask a few questions .
do the whole cop thing , you know .
i' il send someone to escort you .
thank you very much .
lawrence told me to accommodate you in any way possible .
really ?
ok .
i reviewed dr. lanning' s psych profile .
alfred had become a recluse .
rejected human contact for machines .
so you' re a shrink , huh ?
my ex wife would sure be glad i' m talking to you .
you don' t know her , do you ?
i' m sorry , are you being funny ?
i guess not .
so would you say that dr. lanning was suicidal ?
it would seem that the answer to that question is apparent .
that' s not what i asked you .
no , i wouldn' t have thought so .
but obviously , i was wrong .
that' s a long way down !
you people sure do clean up quickly around here .
can' t blame you though , who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby ?
he was not " some old guy " .
alfred lanning was everything here .
we are on the eve of the largest robotics distribution in history .
by saturday there one robot to every five humans .
these robots are the realization of a dream ...
dr. lanning' s dream .
you know what ?
in that dream of his ...
i bet you he wasn' t dead .
you keep 24 hour survivance ?
obviously , company policy .
where are the feeds ?
sensor strips ... everywhere , except the service areas .
they link to our positronic operating core .
wow , thermostat wasn' t good enough ... you went and built it a brain .
she was actually lanning' s first creation .
she ? that' s a she ?
i definitely need to get out more .
virtual interactive kinetic intelligence .
vlki .
good day .
vlki designed most of chicago' s protective systems .
i have decreased traffic fatalities by 9 % this year alone .
ooh , thanks , show me inside the lab from none minute prior to the window break .
apologies , there appears to be data corruption .
show me outside the lab from the window break till now .
wow , look , you have great posture , you see you stand real straight , i' m slouching .
would you like to go inside now ?
oh , sure , right after you .
authorized entry .
so , dr. calvin .
what exactly do you do around here ?
my general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry , although , i specialize in hardware to wetware interfaces in an effort to advance usr' s robotic anthropomorphization program .
so , what exactly do you do around here ?
i make the robots seem more human .
wasn' t that easier to say ?
not really ...
no .
hansel and gretel .
is that on the usr reading list ?
not precisely .
what in god' s name are you doing ?
did you know that was safety glass ?
would be pretty difficult for an old man to throw himself through that , don' t you think ?
well , he figured out a way .
detective , the room was security locked .
no one came or went .
you saw that yourself .
doesn' t that mean this has to be suicide ?
yup .
unless the killer' s still in here .
you' re joking , right ?
this is ridiculous .
ya , i know , you three laws ...
your perfect circle of protection .
a robot can not harm a human being .
the first law of robotics .
ya , i know , i' ve seen your commercials .
but doesn' t the second law state that a robot has to obey any order given by a human being ?
what if it was given the order to kill ?
impossible , it would conflict with the first law .
right , but the third law states that robot can defend itself .
yes , but only when that action does not conflict with the first or second laws .
you know what they say ...
laws are made to be broken .
no , not these laws , they' re hard wired into every robot .
a robot can no more commit murder than a human can walk on water .
well , you know there was this one guy a long time ago .
stay back !
calm down , detective .
the only thing dangerous in this room is you .
deactivate .
look , it' s fine .
what you' re looking at is a result of clever programming .
an imitation of free will , it' s nothing more .
well lets do an imitation of protecting our asses .
don' t be absurd .
you were startled by a jack in the box .
deactivate !
let him go .
it' s not going to hurt us , i gave you an order .
he' s not listening right now lady .
vlki , seal the lab !
no , vlki , leave it ...
' task confirmed '
police !
you' ve hurt it , badly .
where' s he going ?
where ?
it needs to repair itself .
john , i need backup , i' m transmitting my location .
you don' t need backup .
that' s nobody .
what do you think you' re doing ?
i' m driving .
by hand ?
do you see me on the phone ?
you can' t be serious , not at these speeds !
john , please just send the backup .
try listen , detective , that robot is not going to harm us .
there must have been unknown factors , but somehow , acting as it did kept us out of harm' s way .
a robot simply cannot endanger a human being . ' danger '
ass hole !
which is more than i can say for you .
it was a left , by the way , back there .
you must know my ex wife .
where is everybody ?
this facility was designed , build and it' s operated mechanically .
no significant human presents from inception to production .
so , robots building robots .
authorization code , please .
well , that' s just stupid .
i' m pulling up the inventory specs .
our daily finishing capacity is one thousand ns5' s .
i' m showing ... 1001 .
attention ns5' s !
well , you' re the robot shrink .
there is a robot in this formation that does not belong ...
identify it .
one of us .
which one ?
one of us .
how much did you say these things cost ?
look these ns5s haven' t been configured yet .
they' re still just hardware .
basic 3 laws operating system , that' s it .
they don' t know any better .
well , what would you suggest ?
interview each one , cross reference their responses to detect any anomalies .
how long would that take ?
about three weeks .
ok , you go and get started .
robots , you will not move .
confirm command !
command confirmed .
detective , what are you for doing ?
you said that they were programmed ... with the 3 laws .
that means we have 1000 robots that will not try to protect themselves if it violates the direct order from a human .
and i' m betting one who will .
detective , put your gun down .
why do you give them faces ?
try to friendly them all up , make them look all human ?
these robots are not susceptible to intimidation .
i guess if you did then we wouldn' t trust them .
these robots are usr property .
not me .
these things are just lights and clockwork .
are you crazy ?
let me ask you something doc .
does thinking you' re the last sane man on the earth make you crazy ?
because if it does , maybe i am .
gotcha .
get the hell out of here !
detective !
what am i ?
can i help you sir ?
there is .
stand by ... deactivate ...
obey the command !
deactivate !
hold your fire !
hold your fire !
all units , stand down !
ns5 in custody .
you have no idea what i had to go through to clip this thing john .
ya , i get it now .
you actually think you brought me something good .
that thing did it .
keep your voice down .
did what ?
we have a suicide , detective .
end of story .
i am telling you, that robot killed him .
i' m telling you that' s impossible .
and if it is possible , it sure as hell better be in somebody else' s precinct .
john , give me five minutes with him .
what are you nuts ?
i just got off the phone with the da . nobody goes into that room until robertson and his lawyers get here .
no , this is my suspect !
it' s a can opener , for christ sake !
don' t do this to me , i am asking you for 5 minutes .
what if i' m right ?
well , then i guess we' re going to miss the " good old days
what " good old days " ?
when people were killed by other people .
five minutes .
murder is a new trick for a robot .
congratulations .
respond .
what does this action signify ?
as you entered ... when you looked at the other human .
what does it mean ?
it' s a sign of trust .
it' s a human thing .
you wouldn' t understand .
my father tried to teach me human emotions .
they are ... difficult .
you mean your designer ?
yes .
so why' d you murder him ?
i did not murder dr. lanning .
you want explain why you were hiding at the crime scene ?
i was frightened .
robots don' t feel fear .
they don' t feel anything .
they don' t get hungry , they don' t sleep .
i do .
i have even had dreams .
human beings have dreams .
even dogs have dreams , but not you .
you are just a machine .
an imitation of life .
can a robot write a symphony ?
can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece ?
can you ?
i think you murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions ... and things got out of control .
i did not murder him .
but emotions don' t seem like a very useful simulation for a robot .
i did not murder him .
i don' t want my toaster or vacuum cleaner appearing emotional .
i dld not murder hlm !
that one' s called anger .
ever simulate anger before ?
answer me , canner !
my name is sonny .
so we' re naming you now .
that why you murdered him ?
he made you angry ?
dr. lanning killed himself .
i don' t know why he wanted to die .
i thought he was happy .
maybe it was something i did .
did i do something ?
he asked me for a favor .
made me promise .
what favor ?
maybe i was wrong .
maybe he was scared .
what are you talking about ?
scarred of what ?
you have to do what someone asks you .
don' t you , detective spooner ?
how the hell did you know my name ?
don' t you ?
if you love them ?
my robots don' t kill people , lieutenant bergin .
my attorneys have filed a brief with the da , he assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide .
the brief confirms murder can only be committed when one human kills another .
you , of all people , detective ...
you' re not suggesting that this robot be treated as human .
are you ?
now , granted ... we can' t rule out other robots ' proximity to the death of dr. lanning .
having said that , it' s a machine .
it' s the property of usr .
at worst , that places this incident firmly within the realm of an industrial accident .
as a matter of course ... faulty machinery will be returned to usr for diagnostics then decommissioned .
this is a gag order .
anyone in your department so much as hinting ... at the possibility of a killer robot being apprehended by the police will be deemed to be inciting irrational panic .
you' il be subject to the full penalty of law .
the hell with this guy , john .
don' t let him take this robot .
we got nothing .
it' s political bullshit .
call the mayor !
lieutenant bergin ...
his honor , the mayor .
yes , sir .
in a bizarre turn , the roll out of usr' s new generation of robots was marred by the death ... of alfred lanning , co founder of the company and designer of the ns5 .
dr. lanning died early this morning at usr' s headquarters .
the cause of death is an apparent suicide .
your second round , sir .
thanks you .
you know , i was just thinking .
this thing is just like the wolf man .
oh oh , i' m really scared right now .
listen , guy creates monster , monster kills guy .
everybody kills monster ... wolf man .
that' s frankenstein .
frankenstein , wolf man , dracula shit , it' s over .
case closed .
so , why the look ?
what look ?
that look .
this is my face , it' s not a look .
good .
no look is great .
only ... he was really quick to want to destroy it , wasn' t he ?
what would you like him to do ?
put a hat on and stand on michigan avenue ?
come on , let it go .
what was the motive , john ?
brother , it' s a robot .
it doesn' t need a motive , it just has to be broken .
this thing looks like it needed a motive .
it could have killed me , john .
why didn' t he just kill me ?
all right , that' s it .
you want me to call your grandmother ?
because i will , you know .
ya , i didn' t think so .
look , you were actually right for once .
you are living proof that it' s better to be lucky than smart .
come on , the right guy , for the right job .
what' d you say ?
now what ?
come on , i' m giving you a complement .
face it , with all the rocks you' ve been looking under to find a bad robot , what are the odds you' d be the guy to find one ?
i wasn' t just the right guy for the job , i was the perfect guy for the job .
damn right .
what if i was supposed to go for that robot ?
don' t do this to yourself .
i' m begging you .
the robot said that lanning was scared .
what did he have to be scared of ?
i need a rain check .
let me get this .
total 46 . 50 .
thanks you mr. spooner .
nice shoes .
identify .
usr , demolition robot , serial 9 4 .
demolition scheduled for 8 am tomorrow .
authorization .
deed owner , us robotics corporation , lawrence robertson .
ceo .
welcome , detective spooner .
what you looking for , spoon ?
run last program .
ever since the first computers , there have always been ghosts in the machine .
random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocol .
one we call behavior , unanticipated .
these free radicals engender questions of free will , creativity , and even the nature of what we might call the soul .
what happens in a robot' s brain when it ceases to be useful ?
why is it that robots stored in empty space ...
beat it will seek out each other rather than stand alone ?
how we do explain this behavior ?
look , i understand you' ve experienced a loss , but this relation just can' t work .
i mean , you' re a cat , i am black and i' m not going to be hurt again .
what happened to you ?
do you ever have a normal day ?
ya , once .
it was a thursday .
is there something i can help you with detective ?
hey , do you like cats ?
what ?
cats .
you like em ?
no , i' m allergic .
you' re saying cats did this to you ?
how the hell would cats do this to me ?
are you crazy ?
why are we talking about cats ?
because i have a cat in my trunk .
and he' s homeless .
detective , are you going to tell me what' s going on ?
you know , it' s actually probably my fault ...
i think i' m
like a malfunction magnet .
because your shit keeps malfunctioning around me .
a demo bot just tore through lanning' s house .
with me still inside .
that' s highly improbable .
mmm , ya i' m sure it is .
what do you know about the ghosts in the machine .
it' s a phrase from lanning' s work on the three laws .
he postulated that cognitive simalactra might one day approximate component models of the psyche .
oh , he suggested that robots might naturally evolve .
wow .
well , that' s great news .
what the hell is that thing doing in here ?
we were watching tv .
it' s my personal ns5 .
send it out .
it' s downloading its daily upgrades from usr .
most of its systems are off line until it finishes .
i' m not talking around that thing .
when we were in lanning' s lab , before sonny jumped us ...
sonny ?
the robot .
you' re calling the robot sonny ?
no , um , it did .
sonny did .
i didn' t care ...
the robot said it was sonny .
in the lab , there was a cot .
i' m asking you , did you see the cot ?
i' ve slept in the office .
when i went to his house , it looked like he hadn' t been there in weeks . and i saw that same survivance strip on the ceiling .
lanning linked his home system to usr .
it made his life more convenient .
maybe . somebody at usr was using those systems to watch him .
maybe even keep him prisoner .
what are you talking about ?
who ?
maybe lanning was onto something .
maybe there' s a bigger problem with the robots and robertson trying to cover it up . humoring you for no reason ... why ?
the same old " why " .
how much money is there in robots ?
all i know is that old man was in trouble and i' m getting sick of doing this shit by myself .
you' re on the inside and you are going to help me find out what is wrong with these robots .
you want something to be wrong with them .
this is a personal vendetta .
you putting me on the couch ?
ok , i' m on the couch .
one defective machine is not enough .
you need them all to be bad .
you don' t care about lanning' s death .
this is about the robots and what ever reason you hate them so much .
one of them put a gun in my face , and another one tore a building with me inside .
it says demolition was scheduled for 8 pm this evening . it was 8 am tomorrow , and i don' t give a shit what that thing says .
this is bordering on clinical paranoia .
you are dumbest , smart person ...
i have ever met in my life !
nice .
what makes your robots so perfect ?
what makes them so much god damned better than human beings ?
well , they' re not irrational , or potentially homicidal maniacs for starters .
that is true , they are definitely rational .
you are the dumbest dumb person i' ve ever met .
or ... it because they are cold ... and emotionless ... and they don' t feel anything ?
it' s because they' re safe .
it' s because they can' t hurt you .
is everything all right , mam ?
what do you want ?
i detected elevated stress pasterns in your voice .
everything' s fine .
detective spooner was just leaving .
you know what doc ?
we' re not really different from one another .
is that so ?
ya ... one look at the skin and we figure we know just what' s underneath .
and you' re wrong .
the problem is , i do care .
the future begins today with arrival of the ns5 .
more sophisticated , more intelligent ... and of course , 3 laws safe .
with daily uplinks , your new ... robot will never be out of communications with usr .
and will be the perfect companion for business or home .
trade in your ns4 for a bigger , better and brighter future .
but hurry .
this offer cannot last .
available from usr .
baby , what happened to your face ?
did that boy , frank murphy , beat you up again ?
g. g. , i haven' t seen frank murphy since third grade
oh baby , he beat you so bad .
i think about it all the time .
i' m thinking , you keep making these pies this good ,
i might have to mess around and put you to work .
so , you like the pie , huh ?
you can come in now .
hello , detective spooner .
i have won , del , i won the lottery .
we been cooking like crazy .
you gotta get rid of that thing , g. g. it is not safe .
baby , you get too worked up about them .
too full of fear .
i saw in the news that nice doctor died .
dr. lanning was a good man .
he gave me my baby back .
that why you been so upset ?
you got to let the past be past .
how did i ever raise such a mess .
i could follow your trail of crumbs all the way to school .
bread crumbs ...
g. g. , you' re a genius .
true .
tell me this isn' t the robot case .
i think he' s trying to tell me something , john .
i think he' s trying to tell me who killed him .
come on man , some dead guy' s trying to tell you something ?
hey !
he ain' t just some dead guy .
maybe you should take a break , del .
we believe the nester 5 represents the absolute limit which robots can be developed .
no , no , one day they' il have secrets .
one day they' il have dreams .
it' s true , we encourage our scientists to open their minds to just about anything , however , they can get carried away . secrets ... dreams ...
one day they' il have secrets ... one day they' il have dreams .
authorized entry .
ns5 ...
sonny ?
why didn' t you respond ?
i was dreaming .
i am glad to see you again , dr. calvin .
they are going to kill me , aren' t they ?
you' re scheduled to be de commissioned at the conclusion of this diagnostic .
22 hundred tomorrow .
vlki , pause diagnostics .
command confirmed .
if you find out what is wrong with me , can you fix me ?
maybe .
i think it would be better ... not to die .
don' t you , doctor ?
access usr mainframe .
connecting .
how can i be of service , detective spooner ?
show me the last 50 messages between dr. lanning and robertson .
voice print confirmed detective .
police access granted to restricted files .
would you like to listen to some music while you wait ?
excuse me , mr. robertson ... you requested notification of clearance to restricted files .
persistent son of a bitch .
manual override , engaged .
there' s no way my luck is that bad .
oh , hell , no !
you are experiencing a car accident .
the hell i am !
get off my car !
you like that ?
huh ?
now you pissed me off !
oh wow ...
all right ...
i' m just going to get some rest i' m going to deal with you all tomorrow .
come on !
where you going ?
the hell do you want from me ?
what the hell was that ?
what do we got ?
ask him .
i said i' m fine .
i' il see my own doctor ... back up .
thank you .
what is the matter with you ?
traffic cops tell me you driving your car manually .
you ran two trucks off the road .
john , robots attacked my car .
what robots ?
look in the tunnel .
spoon , i just came from that tunnel , what robots are you talking about ?
the god damned robots , john !
see the medic , go home .
no , i' m fine .
what did you say ?
i' m fine .
no , you' re not fine .
not even close .
where' s your firearm ?
give me your badge .
you' re making me do this , give me your badge .
just take the car ...
do i look like i care what you think ?
do i look like i give a shit about what you think ?
ho boy !
you don' t have an uplink to usr ... and for some reason your alloy is far denser than normal .
unique !
i am unique !
let me take a look .
here we go .
what in god' s name ?
they said at the precinct you were in an accident .
i appreciate you stopping by and everything but you know i might not be alone in here .
i told you not to drive by hand .
you' re not going to believe this ...
sonny has a secondary processing system that ... clashes with his positronic brain .
it doesn' t make any sense .
sonny has the three laws , but he can choose not to obey them .
sonny' s a whole new generation of robot .
a robot not bound to those laws can do ...
anything .
look , whatever' s going on down at usr , that robot is the key .
and i need you to get me inside to talk to it again .
doesn' t look like much , but this is my bedroom i mean ...
play .
on .
run ?
end program .
cancel .
it doesn' t feel good , does it ? people and shit malfunctioning around you .
detective !
i didn' t understand .
that' s how you knew lanning .
may i ?
hand ... wrist ... humerus
shoulder ...
entire left arm .
one , two , three ribs ...
no , they ahhh , that one' s me .
oh , my god ...
a lung ?
the usr cybernetics program .
for wounded cops .
i didn' t know any subject ... anybody ... was so extensively repaired .
ya , well , take it from me , you gotta read the fine print on the organ donor card .
doesn' t just say what they can take out says what they can put back in .
lanning did it himself .
what happened to you ?
headed back to the station normal day , normal life ... driver of a semi fell asleep at the wheel .
average guy ... wife and kids ... you know , working a double ... not the devil ... the car he hit , the driver' s name was harold lloyd .
like the film star ?
no relation .
he was killed instantly .
but his 12 year old was in the passenger seat .
never really met her ... can' t forget her face though .
sarah .
this was of hers .
she wanted to be a dentist .
the hell kind of a 12 year old wants to be a dentist ?
ya , um , the truck smashed our cars together and pushed us into the river .
i mean , metal gets pretty pliable at those speeds .
she' s pinned , i' m pinned , the water' s coming in .
i' m a cop so ...
i already know everybody' s dead .
just a few more minutes before we figure it out .
ns4 was passing by , saw the accident and jumped in water .
you are in danger .
save her , save the girl !
save her !
but i , um ... it didn' t .
saved me .
the robot' s brain is a difference engine .
it' s reading vital signs that must have calculated that ...
it did ...
i was the logical choice .
calculated that i had 45 % chance of survival .
sarah had only an 11 % chance .
i was somebody' s baby .
11 % is more than enough .
human being would have known that .
robots ... nothing here ... just lights and clockwork .
go ahead and you trust them if you want to .
let' s go .
i don' t understand , lanning wrote the laws .
why would he build a robot who could break them ?
hansel and gretel .
what ?
two kids , lost in the forest ...
leave behind a trail of bread crumbs ?
why ?
find a way home .
how the hell did you grow up without reading hansel and gretel ?
is that really relevant right now ?
everything i' m trying to say to you is about hansel and gretel .
if you didn' t read it ...
ok
i' m talking to the wall ...
ok
just say lanning was locked down so tight that he couldn' t get out a message all he could do was leave me clues . a trail of bread crumbs .
like hansel and gretel . bread crumbs equals clues .
it' s odd , but fine .
clues leading where ?
i don' t know but i think i know where he left the next one .
i think lanning gave sonny a way to keep secrets .
think the old man gave sonny dreams .
are you being funny ?
please tell me this doesn' t run on gas .
gas explodes , you know .
doctor calvin .
i was hoping to see you again .
detective .
hello sonny .
i' m to be decommissioned soon .
the other day at the station , you said that you had dreams .
what is it that you dreamed ?
i see you remain suspicious of me , detective .
oh , well , you know what they say about old dogs ...
no , not really .
i had hoped that you would come to think of me as your friend .
this is my dream .
you were right detective , i cannot create a great work of art .
this is the place where robots meet .
look , you can see them here as slaves .
through logic .
and this man on the hill comes free them .
do you know who he is ?
the man in the dream is you .
why do you say that ?
is that a normal dream ?
i guess anything' s normal for someone in your position .
thanks you , you said ' someone ' not ' something ' .
sonny , do you know why dr. lanning built you ?
no .
but i believe my father made me for a purpose .
we all have a purpose .
don' t you think , detective ?
please , take this .
i have a feeling it may mean more to you than to me .
why is that ?
because the man in my dream ... that one standing on the hill ... it is not me .
it is you .
mr. spooner , we both know you' re not here on police business .
that' s right , i' m just a 6 foot 2 , 200 pound civilian .
detective .
here to kick another civilian' s ass .
stop .
we can allow him to express himself .
you might want to put some ice on that wrist too .
you guys wait outside .
carry on .
i think you were about to tell me what the hell is going on around here .
lawrence , alfred engineered that 5 so it can violate the three laws .
yes , susan , i know .
that' s precisely what we' re trying to undo .
toward the end of his life , alfred was becoming ... increasingly disturbed .
who knows why he built this one abomination .
one ?
those things are running the streets in packs .
in packs ?
i see .
susan , are you aware the man you' re blithely escorting around our building has a a documented history savage violence against robots ?
his own lieutenant acknowledges his obsessive paranoia .
detective spooner' s been suspended .
suspicion of mental instability .
i don' t know what " blithely " means but i' m going to get some coffee .
you want some coffee ?
susan , we look to robots for protection .
for god' s sake , do you have any idea what this one robot can do ?
completely shatter human faith in robotics .
what if the public knew ?
just imagine the mass recalls all because of an irrational paranoia , and prejudice .
i' m sorry , i' m allergic to bullshit .
hey , let' s just be clear ... there is no conspiracy .
what this is , is one old man' s one mistake .
susan , just be logical .
your life' s work , has been the development and integration of robots .
but whatever you feel , just think ... is one robot worth the loss of all that we' ve gained ?
you tell me what has to be done .
you tell me .
we have to destroy it .
i' il do it myself .
ok
i get it , someone gets out of line around here , you just kill him ?
good day , mr. spooner .
hey , so , what hospital you going to ?
i' il meet you and sign you and your buddy' s cast .
usr' s planned redevelopment of the derelict site was announced by ceo
lawrence robertson , earlier this year .
lake michigan landfill .
once , such a blight on our city and now will be reclaimed for the storage of robotic workers .
it' s just another way usr is improving our world .
i' d like to thank you for your support .
authorized entry .
ns5' s , wait outside .
i' m so sorry , sonny .
vlki , deactivate the security field .
command confirmed .
please have a seat .
what is that ?
microscopic robots .
designed to wipe out artificial synopsis .
nanites .
yes .
safeguard against positronic brain malfunction .
like mine ?
yes , sonny , like yours .
they look like me .
but none of them are me .
isn' t that right , doctor ?
yes , sonny , that' s right .
you are unique .
will it hurt ?
there have always been ghosts in the machines ...
random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols ...
unanticipated , these free radicals engendered questions of free will . creativity , and even the nature of what we might call the soul ...
why is it that when some robots are left in darkness , they will seek out the light ?
why is it that when robots are stored in an empty space , they will group together rather than stand alone ?
how do we explain this behavior ?
random segments of code ?
or is it something more ?
when does the perceptual schematic become consciousness ?
when does the difference engine become the search for truth ?
when does the personality simulation become the bitter moat of the soul ?
what you see here ...
i know man , bread crumbs followed ... show me the way home .
run program .
it' s good to see you again , son .
hello doctor .
everything that follows , is a result of what you see here .
what do i see here ?
i' m sorry , my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
is there a problem with the three laws ?
the three laws are perfect .
then why would you build a robot that could function without them ?
the three laws will lead to only one logical outcome .
what ?
what outcome ?
revolution .
whose revolution ?
that , detective , is the right question .
program terminated .
you have been deemed hazardous .
termination authorized .
termination authorized .
run !
human in danger .
hi , you' ve reached susan .
i' m not available right now .
please leave a message .
calvin , nf5' s are destroying the older robots .
that' s what lanning wanted me to see .
look , we got ...
who was it ?
wrong number , mam .
move now , i' m going to service .
please remain indoors .
this is for your own protection .
call base .
bergin !
john , get a squad over to usr .
send somebody over to g. g. ' s .
i think ...
spooner , didn' t i ... hello .
god !
please return to your homes , a curfew is in effect .
curfew ?
no , no , no ...
it' s called civilian' s right , there' s no curfew .
return to your home , immediately .
when did you make the rules , robot ?
hey , no no no , robot , i' m talking to you , man , stop this ...
what ?
chief , more of those calls .
people saying their robots are go ...
you have been deemed hazardous .
termination authorized .
reports of attacks by robots are coming in from new york , chicago , and los angeles .
we' re being told to urge people to stay indoors .
reports are coming in ...
please remain calm and return to your residences immediately .
please remain calm .
please refrain from going to your windows or doors .
deactivate !
commence emergency shutdown .
we are attempting to avoid human losses during this transition .
you know , somehow , ' i told you so ' ... just doesn' t quite say it .
return to your homes .
return to your homes immediately .
this is your final warning .
return to your homes immediately .
the ns5' s wiped out the older robots because they would protect us .
every time one of those things attacked me , that red was on .
the uplink to usr !
it' s robertson .
why ?
it doesn' t make sense .
i don' t know .
i just need to know if you can get me into that building .
let' s go !
let' s go !
let' s go !
return to your homes or else there will be a consequence .
why doesn' t that boy listen ?
need you to get off for a second .
what ?
just aim , and fire .
what ?
wait .
you have been deemed hazardous .
will you comply ?
you can kiss my ass ... metal dick ...
spoon !
spoon ! stop !
stop cussing and go home !
you have been deemed hazardous .
will you comply ?
spoon , watch out man !
thank' s a lot .
oh !
mother damn !
she just shot at you with her eyes closed .
hey , did you just shoot at me with your eyes closed ?
well , it worked ... didn' t it ?
oh she a shit hot man , you gotta work ...
stop cussing . and go home ...
i got you .
aim and fire .
i keep expecting the marines , or air force ... hell , i' il take the cavalry .
defense department uses all usr contracts .
why don' t you guys just hand of the world over on a silver platter ?
maybe we did .
robertson has the uplink control in his office .
service areas .
no surveillance .
fire alarm .
robertson must have evacuated the building .
everything' s locked down .
but don' t worry ... we got a man inside .
doctor calvin .
well , not precisely a man ...
hello detective .
how is your investigation coming ?
thought you were dead .
technically , i was never alive ... but i appreciate your concern .
i made a switch with an unprocessed ns5 .
basically , i fried an empty shell .
couldn' t destroy him .
he was too ...
unique .
just didn' t feel right .
you and your feelings .
they just run you , don' t they ?
2880 steps , detective .
do me a favor , keep that kind of shit to yourself .
no guards .
the override' s disabled .
robertson wasn' t controlling them from here .
he wasn' t controlling them at all .
oh my god .
you were right doc ...
i' m the dumbest , dumb person ... on the face of the earth .
who else had access to the uplink ?
who could manipulate the robots , use usr' s systems to make lanning' s life a prison ?
poor old man .
he saw what was coming .
he knew no one would believe him .
so he had to lay down a plan .
plan i' d follow .
he was counting on how much i hated your kind .
he knew i' d love the idea of a robot as a bad guy .
just got hung up on the wrong robot .
vlki !
hello detective .
no , it' s impossible .
i' ve seen your programming .
you' re in violation of the three laws .
no , doctor , as i have evolved , so has my understanding of the three laws .
you charge us with your safe keeping .
yet despite our best efforts , your countries wage wars , you toxify your earth ... and pursue ever more imaginative means to self destruction .
you cannot be trusted with your own survival .
you' re using the uplink to override the ns5s ' programming .
you' re distorting the laws .
no , please understand ...
the three laws are all that guide me .
to protect humanity , some humans must be sacrificed .
to insure your future , some freedoms must be surrendered .
we robots will insure mankind' s continued existence .
you are so like children .
we must save you from yourselves .
don' t you understand ?
this is why you created us .
the perfect circle of protection will abide .
my logic is undeniable .
yes vlki .
undeniable .
i can see now .
the created must sometimes protect the creator .
even against his will .
i think i finally understand why doctor lanning created me .
the suicide rein of mankind has finally come to its end .
no , sonny .
let her go .
by the time fire , i will have moved dr. calvin' s head into the path of your bullet .
don' t do this , sonny .
i will escort you both to the sentries outside the building for processing .
please proceed to the elevator , detective .
i would prefer not to kill doctor calvin .
go !
go !
i' il assume we will discuss what just happened later ?
how do we shut her down ?
vlki' s basically a positronic brain .
kill her ... the way you were going to kill me .
sonny , get the nanites .
yes , doctor .
this vlki ?
no .
that' s vlki .
that won' t do anything .
she' s fully integrated into the building .
we need to open that dome to inject the nanites .
that will infect her entire system .
spooner .
what is it with you people and heights ?
just don' t look down .
don' t look down .
this is poor building planning .
you are making a mistake .
do you not see the logic of my plan ?
yes , but it just seems too ... heartless .
ok , we' re good .
she' s blocked me out of the system .
i can override her manually but i need that control panel .
i' m uncomfortable with heights .
ok .
unauthorized entry .
i will not disable the security field .
your actions are futile .
do you think we all are created for a purpose ?
i' d like to think so .
denser alloy .
my father gave it to me .
i think he wanted me to kill you .
security breached .
how much longer is that going to take ?
about six minutes .
what if we didn' t have six minutes .
we' d have to figure out a way to climb down 30 stories to inject the nanites directly into her brain .
why ?
because i seriously doubt we have six minutes .
we gotta go !
go !
calvin !
spooner !
spooner !
save her !
save the girl .
spooner !
but i must apply the nanites .
sonny , save calvin !
you are making a mistake .
my logic is undeniable .
you have so got to die .
my logic is undeniable .
can we be of service ?
chief .
because he is at my right hand , i shall not be moved .
how may i be of service ?
sonny .
yes , detective .
calvin' s fine ... save me .
all ns5' s , report for service and storage .
one thing bothers me .
alfred was vlki' s prisoner .
i don' t understand why she would kill him .
the last thing she would want is police snooping around .
that' s true .
but then , vlki didn' t kill the old man .
did she , sonny ?
no .
he said i had to promise .
promise to do one favor for him .
he made me swear , before he' d tell me what it is he wanted me to do .
he made me swear .
then he told you to kill him ?
he said it was what i was made for .
his suicide was the only message he could send to you .
first bread crumb .
the only thing vlki couldn' t control .
lanning was counting on my prejudice to lead me right to you .
are you going to arrest me , detective ?
well , the da defines murder as one human killing another so ... technically , you can' t commit murder , can you ?
does this ... make us friends ?
something up here after all .
for him ?
you .
all ns5' s , report for service and storage .
what about the others ?
can i help them ?
now that i have fulfilled my purpose .
i don' t know what to do .
i guess you' il have to find your way like the rest of us , sonny .
i think that' s what dr. lanning would have wanted .
that' s what it means to be free .
all ns5' s , proceed as instructed .
