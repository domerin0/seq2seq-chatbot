primer on david aames senior .
my father wasn' t built forthe 21st century .
he never went to mcdonald' s , not once .
he never watched television , andyet ... his bi ggest magazine is still the tv digest .
he and my mother threw the grandest parties ofthe literary world .
ballooned .
jumped out ofairplanes .
he sought adventure .
his autobiography is the manual ... for every cutthroat publisher in new yorkk city .
it' s called defending the kingdom .
i' ve read it .
page 1 27
david jr . was a delight as a child .
did i miss something here ? .
was that all he wrote about you ? .
i don' t think he ever got over the fact ... that i' m absolutely ... terrified of heights .
the irony continues .
when he and my mother were run over by a drunken teenager ... on new year' s eve ten years ago ... he left the keys ... to the kkingdom ... to me .
fifty one percent control .
forty nine percent going to a group ofseven board members ... who all thought they were first in line .
andyou believe the board the seven dwarfs put you here to take control of your company ? .
what do you care ? .
we' re just talking .
and tonight' s wednesday night ... and i go to black angus for dinner with my two daughters on wednesdays .
so i' il have to leave soon .
you do understand that our time is limited , don' t you ? .
if i talk ... you' il just think i' m crazy .
with all the possible respect i can offer a man ... wearing a latex mask and spouting conspiracy theories , david ... believe me , you' ve crossed that bridge .
enjoy your dinner .
there are five basic emotions in life , david .
tell me , what emotion gripped him ... before he entered that cell ? .
was it guilt ... hate ... shame ... revenge ...
love ? .
i' m completely on the wrong track , aren' t i ? .
who needs ice ? .
david , happy birthday .
you have got the greatest taste in shoes , bar none anywhere .
emma , have you met lynette ? .

i' m all packed .
i' m going back to london and i understand .
you put me up for the other attorney' s job so you didn' t have to fire me .
that' s a classy move and your father would have done the same .
it' s okay , tommy .
i became incompetent .
is there anything more unbecoming than an aging mascot ? .
i cared foryour father .
i lived and breathed for him .
these guys , the seven dwarfs ... they thinkyou' re stupid a corporate hazard , a rogue .
they are gonna find a way to get you out , david .
they' re lined up for your office , your life ...
they' re lined up foryour office , your life ... your position .
they' re working day and night ... to cheat you out ofyour 51 %% vote .
and they' re gonna sell this tradition ofwords ... so they can eat in a better cafeteria .
but what they don' t know is this .
people will read again !
i got it .

you will never know the exquisite pain ... of the guy who goes home alone ... because without the bitter , baby , the sweet ain' t as sweet .
have a good time .
the sweet and sour speech again .
why are you scared of heights ? .
many people are scared of heights .
it' s not the height that bothers me .
it' s the impact that terrifies me .
i won' t stay long .
hey , paolo .
hello .
i have to take you for a walk .
i' m glad he protects you .
he' s a lethal canine .
i love living here , and i refuse to clean up .
no problem .
i have to work around the clock to keep this place .
you really are a dancer .
for 1 4 years .
but i don' t dance like you dance .

i like your life .
well , it' s mine and you can' t have it .
i don' t wanna know the story behind this photo .
who' s sergio ? .
it' s a nickname .
your nickname is sergio ? .
it' s a long story .
and we don' t know each other .
so many secrets .
that' s because i' m an arms dealer .
i' ve never known an arms dealer .
you do now .
what about you ? .
what' s your nickname ? .
citizen dildo .
you are not staying over .
never run a company .
stay an artist .
stay an arms dealer .
oh , please .
somehow i can' t play the violin foryou .
although , it must be difficult controlling all those people' s lives .
everyone at that party is connected to you for survival in some way .
it seems .
ever been married ? .
did you ever accept any ofyour 1 2, 000 proposals ? .
twelve thousand and eight .
no .
and you moved to new york to dance , paint , act and deal arms ? .
right .
do you wanna hear jeff buckley or vicki carr ? .
jeff buckley or vicki carr ? .
both simultaneously .
everyone said , " don' t go to new york .
i just think good things will happen ... ifyou' re a good person with a good attitude .
don' t you think ? .
you think i' m naive ? .
no .
i really don' t .
i dug her completely .
somehow i' d found the last semi guyless girl in new yorkk city .
i have to get to sleep .
truthfully , i also work mornings as a dental assistant .
boy , am i going to the wrong dentist .
andyou didn' t immediately wanna sleep with her ?
well , you kknow , i' m a pleasure delayer .
how does that work ? .
pleasure delayer ?
you don' t know ? .
you keep a relationship casual ... until the absolute breakking point .
and then one evening or afternoon or morning it could be months from now .
you know how it works .
no , actually i don' t .
i' ve been married for 22 years .
you' ve got dinner with your daughters .
that' s right , i do .
back then i had intricate systems with women ... you wouldn' t believe .
like what ? .
hey , doc , don' t get melancholy over the 30 seconds you were single ... a long time ago .
that' s what you think i' m doing ? .
oh , yes .
you might be right .
let' s continue .
time is not our friend .
just our shortcomings , that' s all we' re allowed to draw .
i' ve never drawn such a true likeness before .
mine' s finished .
already ? .
done .
that' s how you see me ? .
maybe i didn' t add enough money .
no , something you' d see on a wall in a steak house in hell .
it' s wonderful .
sign it .
let' s see yours .
give me that .
i feel bad .
you said to draw a caricature .
i know .
i couldn' t .
i saw you like that .
it' s very good .
i' il sell it to you .
you monster .
how much for it ? .
one kiss .
that smile is gonna be the end of me .
and what happens when your friend calls you tomorrow ? .
he just met you a few hours before me .
he' d do the same .
i see that friendship is important to you .
it is .
it is .
and as his best friend ...
i know he' s trying to finish a novel about inadequacy and rejection .
so the longer that i stay , the better it is for his career .
your career is the one i' d worry about .
sorry .
no .
no , you' re more right than you even know .
i used to be one of those guys that just ... snowboarded through his life ... with no focus ... whatsoever .
when did you change ? .
about five minutes ago .
every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around .
and to those who thinkk thatyou' re a charlatan ?
i understand .
the perception ofa head frozen somewhere ... waiting for reanimation sounds likke science fiction .
what are you watching ? .
it' s the greatest show .
it' s called sofia .
it is at the frontier ofa new science .
life extension .
how do you accomplish such a thing ?
i' ve seen this 30 times .
life is full ofsurprises .
but the greatest surprise ofall is that this doesn ' t have to end ever .
we did a story on this guy .
he owns half of arizona .
is he a fraud ? .
how would you ever know ? .
good point .
can you unfreeze a human life ?
takke the case ofbenny the dog .
benny' s a dog .
he was frozen for three months and thawed out to live a normal life .
that' s comforting ? .
it' s safe for benny .
i' m in .
we' d better watch out .
raymond tooley , creator oflife extension .
the bookk is life ..
the sequel .
where are you going ? .
i left my number on your fridge .
come here .
i want to tell you a secret .
i meant that to be your forehead .
thank you for the inspiration .
i will now attempt to run my company showing compassion ... for the seething throng of my partners ... who root quietly for me to fail .
and for things you don' t even know .
thankyou .
i' m gonna go to work .
i have a company to run .
pleasure delayer .
hey , handsome .

i wanted to finish what we were talking about .
and ? .
how did it go with our moth girl ? .
she turn into a butterfly foryou ? .
yes , she did .
she did .
i can tell by the way you were walking you didn' t sleep with her .
let me guess .
you haven' t slept with her because ... it' s more fun when you can draw it out .
sex just isn' t as good if a woman hasn' t told her friends ... she' d never sleep with you .
right on the money, julie .
she must be exhausted from trying to be witty foryou all night .
hey, julie .
sorry .
it' s okay .
you never seem to be there foryour friends until they' ve given up on you .
i' m not blowing you off .
i just
i wanna be alone for a little bit .
trust me .
i have a lot of things i have to take care of .
and ifwe' re friends , which we are ... okay , then you' il understand that .
i' m sorry .
i got weird .
i missed an audition and ... it just made me feel bad you didn' t invite me to your party .
you wanna make it up to me ? .
i won' t tell a soul .
would you do a story on me if i made a cd ? .
sure i would .
do you like my music ? .
it' s vivid .
well , if i weren' t me , i would buy a cd by me .
well , you know , ifyou can reach one person
wow .
what' s happiness to you , david ? .
what' s happiness to me ? .
what is happiness  ' cause for me ... this is happiness just being with you .
there' s one thing that bothers me .
why did you tell brian that i was your fuck buddy ? .
i didn' t tell him that .
i didn' t say that .
when did you stop caring , david ? .
caring about what ? .
about the consequences of the promises that you' ve made .
promises ? .
yeah , the promises .
i thought
get the fuck what are you talking about ? .
do you understand how hard it is to pretend to be your buddy ? .
david , i love you .
i fucking love you !
i fucking love you !
fuck !
whoa , whoa , whoa !
don' t do this .
don' t do this .
you fucked me four times the other night .
you' ve been inside me .
i swallowed your cum .
that means something .
slow down .
four times it means something .
four times .
stop the car .
twenty four hours a day , i live with this aching possibility ... that you might call me to do something .
let' s go to your house .
i wanna see where you live .
just slow down .
i want you to stop the car !
don' t you know when you sleep with someone ... your body makes a promise whether you do or not ? .
tell me something , david .
do you believe in god ? .
what are you doing ? .
okay , i love you .
i love you .
don' t do it !
you' re amazing .
did you get to work all right ? .
no , actually , i had a horrible dream .
you dreamed you' d never . see me again .
i left your apartment , i went downstairs to the car ... and my friend , the stalker , had followed me there .
yes .
and she wanted to talk to me .
and i remember i had this buzz , you know ... that buzz from you and me .
i think my mind was still on that terrible drawing of me .
but she was upset ... about i don' t know .
i got in the car and ... she drove off a bridge ... and committed suicide with me in the car .
i thought you were going straight to work .
but i survived ... with my arm and my face ... reconstructed .
and what' s worse ... is that i can' t wake up .
and how was your house after the party ? .
party ? .
what party ? .
the party .
remember ? .
red dress , strappy shoes .
i spilled something on your shirt .
sweet and sour .
and the saddest girl to ever hold a martini .
my dreams are a crueljokke .
they taunt me .
even in my dreams , i' m an idiot ... who kknows he' s about to wakke up to reality .
ifi could only avoid sleep .
but i can ' t .
i try to tell myself what to dream .
i try to dream that i' m flying .
something free .
it never workks .
is that the only thing you dream ? .
i don' t i don' t remember .
do you dream about the car accident ? .
here' s whatyou remember from a coma .
nothing .
what happened next ? .
what really happened ? .
what , didn' tyou read the file ?
i was out for three and a halfweeks .
my face and my arm shattered and my jaw was broken in four places .
no surgery could be performed because ofthe coma .
you can' t feel the darkness ... or numbness .
you can' t even feel .
and then ...
i came back to life .
just like that dog .
benny .
you know , benny the dog .
benny .
benny the dog .
only my life was no longer normal .
there are blinding migraines now nerve damage .
why ?
this is how big business operates random accidents ... a lifestyle mishap .
they are not coincidences .
how do you think airtight contracts are broken ? .
these are power upheavals .
i' m from ohio .
we don' t have power upheavals .
they are in the news every day right between the lines .
someone did this to me .
my father wrote about this in his book .
chapter one , page one ... paragraph one
what is the answer to 99 out of 1 00 questions ? .
money .
david , lookk , i don' t wanna worryyou .
i' m holding them off , but we got a situation here .
the bylaws of the board protect your 5 1 %% vote ... only ifyou' re mentally acute .
i' m sorry that poor girl died ... but you' ve handed the board a real gift with your mishap .
they' d likke to declare you incapacitated .
but you' re backk .
you sound good to me , so let' s fight the fuckkers ... and have a full recovery .
and maybe you should let people see you , yeah ?
the last time we were together . you were in a coma ... and you were very fucking rude to me .
you didn' t say a word .
yes , well , the rumors of my death have been mildly exaggerated .
who could i trust ?
the ants were takking over the anthill .
who could i trust ?
the cranial structure was based on 30 pins ... and fastened by micro panels and bits of bone from the mandible .
it appears the cartilage graphs have maintained your cheek structure .
unfortunately , because you were in a coma
doctors .
theirpower is injargon , so you study up .
is that the procedure for all bilateral periorbital hematomas ... in a lefort three fracture of a comatose patient ? .
in a lefort three ? .
you do your best .
absolutely .
the potential for intracranial brain damage was too great .
beyond the cheek grafts , dr. pomeranz ... are the pins fastened with any kind of aluminum which could ionize ... and cause that pressure in my head ? .
i' m ready for another operation .
we are working on processes .
but you' re specifically not at the stage where we can experiment .
experiment .
use me .
the headaches will go away .
these are more than headaches .
these are like steel plates slicing through my every thought .
we' re not cowboys .
we can' t just wing it .
because i can' t think straight most of the time .
we can increase your medication .
oh , yes , medication .
