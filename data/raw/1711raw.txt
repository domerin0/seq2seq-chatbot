yeah , yeah , i' m that lou girl .
i' m a iegend .
i' m a iegend .
and iike coke ...
i need no intro , no bio , no resume ...
i won the ncaa division 1 championship ... the women' s u. s. open , and had sixteen victories on the lpga tour .
aii that exists in the world of marketing are perceptions ... in the mind of the customer , or prospect .
the perception is the reality .
everything else is just an iilusion .
but that' s not why i' m here talking with you today .
there are more accomplished women than me .
nothing is reai except what we perceive to be real .
we make it real ...
i am here , because i am more than the sum totai of my accomplishments .
i' m a story ...
the world belongs ... to those who controi the brand ...
a reputation ...
for good or bad profits ...
a brand ...
mom , apple pie , the giri next door ... everybody' s ail american , michaei jordan and elvis ...
i am not unlike nike or coke ...
let me introduce myself ...
i am brand louise ... and i' ii bet in this room today , there has got to be brand bobs ... and brand sues , and brand whatever your name may be .
be your own brands .
create the story , the iegend ... create the myth that iives inside each of you .
it' s you , the advertising and the marketing professionals ... that make this world go ' round .
you can make people buy and do ... anything you iike .
we' re aii just sheep waiting to be ied ...
is that brainwashing ?
yes .
is that good or bad ?
it depends on who is in controi of the brand .
mother theresa , osama bin laden , the easter bunny , enron .
aii brands ...
you can go to brandlou . com or aol keyword b iou and purchase my build your own brand ... and the power of visualization video and cassette tapes .
and good iuck .
you' re iucky dick , because i have you sitting next to me tonight .
that' s great .
so , you reaily think the iighter shaft ...
wiii get me on the fairway ?
i think it' s your swing ... not the club that' s keeping you off the fairway .
i just love your apartment .
its great views .
i' m so glad you could come .
so i was iying two ... about one eighty away .
way to the right .
you know how it dog iegs ... so i puiled out my five .
i choked ...
oh lou , if you' re back on the tour , speaking engagements ... endorsements , they double .
and once you start winning , they' ii double again !
weii that' s not the reason lou would go back on the tour .
oh , joei knows that sweetie .
so teii me honestly lou ... does this visualization that you' ve been preaching , does it reaily work ?
elyse , do you know how many times a day i picture myself sinking puts ?
driving bails right down the dead center of the fairway ?
hitting out of sand traps to within inches of the pin ?
thousands .
you bet , thousands .
why don' t you seii her your tapes , lou ?
or at ieast give her the toii free number .
sure , why not ?
they come in reaily , reaily handy , when you' re having ...
a hard time sleeping .
carly , something wrong ?
c' mon , you know i love your tapes .
they' re great .
they' re actuaily quite fantastic , carly .
sweet .
they are .
you got to get it up before you can get it in !
joel , shut up .
excuse my tasteless husband .
i find this visualization thing reaily interesting .
oh they have been tests .
at stanford they tested ... three groups of people shooting free throws .
the first group practiced every day in the gym .
the second group ... practiced only through visualization ... and the third didn' t practice at ail .
so you mean , one group practiced for reai and the other group ...
practiced only in their heads ...
that' s right .
and they found that the group that practiced only in their heads ... improved by thirty percent , identicai to the group that actuaily ...
practiced in the gym .
we should do a test with golfers .
dick ...
yes , dear .
lou' s a golfer not a psychologist .
are there any books ... yon the subject that you could recommend ?
sorry , what , what' s that ?
she asked if there were any ...
good books on the subject ?

you can' t expect companionship , romance , running a household ... a mother , a father , a maid , a psychiatrist ... and a social director all from the same source .

that' s it ?
that' s it .
she was there with some guy .
and it just happened .
i guess it didn' t hurt having her around to see you sign that ... big contract .
you ever get the urge to stray even though you' re with ... a woman iike that ?
' cuz for me ... every time i see a woman i know i can' t afford , i comfort myself ... thinking that somewhere out there , there' s somebody ... that' s sick and tired of fucking that .

ln the books , it' s the 22th immutable laws of marketing .
we analyze a situation to make sure sure that the truth is on our side .
but it' s an illusion .
there is no objective reality .
there are no real facts .
all that exists ... in the world of business and in the world of marketing ... are the perceptions in the mind of the customer or prospect .
the perception is the reality ... everything else is just an illusion .
