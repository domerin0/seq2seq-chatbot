police found her in the street .
looks like she was bitten .
some kind of an animal .
jesus !
her water' s broken !
she' s going into uterine contractions !
we' il have to do a c section !
what you got down there , little man ?
oh , that' s my heat seeker .
i' il bet it is .
aah !
ha ha ha !
so , where are we going ?
it' s a surprise , baby .
yeah , i like surprises .
yeah .
whoo !
oh , my god !
what the fuck are we doing here ?
whoo !
look at all that .
ha ha ha !
what the fuck is that ?
hey !
what did you just say ?
wow .
whoo !
hey , what' s up ?
unh !
man !
whoo !
all right .
ha ha ha !
yeah .
whoo !
ha ha ha !
what' s happening ?
unh !
whoa !
man .
fuck .
fuck .
i need a drink .
ahh !
no !
no !
aah !
what' s wrong , baby ?
aah !
aah !
no !
no !
aah !
no !
ha ha ha !
is that him ?
jesus , that' s him .
it' s blade .
it' s the daywalker .

aah !
hey !
i' m gonna rip your fucking head off !
unh !
aah !
aah !
that' s him !
that' s him !

we' re gonna jack you up .
make him hurt bad .
whoo !
yaah !
yaah !
quinn ...
i' m getting a little tired of chopping you up .
thought i might try fire for a change .
give my regards to frost .
no !
please don' t !
put him out .
yes , sir .
paramedics .
got a charred cadaver here for you .
still warm , too .
1 , 2, 3 .
oh , jesus , that' s rank .
paramedics said he was still screaming when they found him stapled to a wall .
that' s very pretty .
did you check the chem count ?
his blood sugar' s 3 times norm , phosphorus and uric acid are off the charts .
you took this off a d. o. a. ?
yeah .
but this doesn' t make any sense .
the red blood cells are biconvex , which is impossible .
look at the polys .
they' re binucleated .
ok , curtis , it' s 3 . 00 in the morning
this is not a joke .
i' ve got the body sitting in the morgue right now .
i thought you promised to give me some distance .
i just want you to come down and take a look .
ok .
show me the body .
and i don' t want to hear a word about us .
done .
we' ve had that conversation .
you haven' t started on the internal organs yet ?
just a blood sample through the pericardium .
the maxilla looks a little deformed .
there' s some odd muscle structure around the canines .
i' m going to start the " y " and check the tracheal mucosa .
let me ask you something .
honestly ... you ever have second thoughts about us ?
sometimes .
but then i remember how much of an asshole you were .
want to cut me some slack here ?
you asked for some time off , i gave you some time off .
look , curtis
i' m trying .
it' s over .
yaah !
aah !
call security !
aah !
came back to finish you off .
get out of my way , you freak !
freeze !
motherfucker , are you out of your damn mind ? !
aah !
aah !
yaah !
aah !
hey , you !
freeze !
aah !
aah !
aah !
freeze !
hold it right there !
aah !
aah !
my shoulder .
it' s dislocated .
aah !
uhh !
whistler .
whistler .
bringing home strays now ?
she' s been bitten .
should' ve killed her , then .
yeah , i know .
but i didn' t .
you watch her close .
if she starts to turn , you finish her off .
or i will .
uhh .
she' s borderline .
another hour , she' d be well into the change .
dr karen jenson ,
listen close .
i' m going to inject you with allium sativum garlic .
this is going to hurt a lot .
it was quinn .
frost' s little errand boy ?
you get a lead on him ?
no .
too bad .
uhh !
hold her .
i give her fifty fifty if she makes it through the night .
blade ... the daywalker still pursuing his ridiculous crusade .
how many died ?
we don' t have an exact count .
apparently , he used a lot of silver .
we' re having difficulty
send in frost .
deacon frost .
you can come in now .
these nightclubs of yours are dangerous .
are they ?
they draw needless attention to our kind .
you know our policy .
your policy , not mine .
our livelihood ... depends on our ability to blend in and our discretion .
maybe it' s time we forgot about discretion .
we should be ruling the humans , not running around making back alley treaties with them .
for fuck' s sake , these people are our food , not our allies .
you' re out of line , frost .
am i ?
or maybe i' m just the first to say out loud what we' ve all been thinking .
we have existed this way for thousands of years .
who are you to challenge our ways ?
you' re not even a pureblood .
like it matters .
i was born a vampire , as was every other member of this house , but you , frost ...
you were merely turned .
the world belongs to us , not the humans .
you know that .
do we have any other business to discuss ?
well , uh ... there' s the matter of our offshore accounts .
we' re having difficulty
and have you made the transfer to the
gitano ... you may wake up one day and find yourself extinct .
you' re a week early .
yeah .
whistler says i' m building up a resistance to the serum .
yeah , i figured that might happen .
you take care , all right ?
i must be getting soft in my old age ,
letting you bring home a stray like that .
it was damn stupid of you .
might' ve lucked out , though .
i checked her background .
it turns out she' s a haematologist .
she might be useful to us .
i doubt it .
i' m serious .
i took a look at that notebook of hers .
she' s onto something .
i had to increase the dose .
it' s over 50 milligrams now .
that' s getting dangerous .
just do it , old man .
ahh .
uhh ...
wander off the beaten path , doctor ?
who are you people ?
my name' s abraham whistler .
you' ve met blade .
so , am i a prisoner here ?
not at all .
we just had to take certain precautions before we let you go .
you got to understand , they' re everywhere .
vampires the hominus nocturna .
we hunt them , you see moving from one city to the next tracking their migrations .
they' re hard to kill .
they tend to regenerate .
and i' m supposed to believe all this ?
well , you already met mr. crispy at the hospital .
what do you think ?
so , what do you use , then ?
stakes ?
crosses ?
crosses don' t do squat .
some of the legends are true , though .
vampires are severely allergic to silver .
feed them garlic , and they go into anaphylactic shock .
then , of course , there' s always sunlight , ultraviolet rays .
i got this sucker running .
you want to give it a try tonight ?
it' s still heavy .
well , you' re so big .
if you want to live to see another day , you' il be out of town by nightfall .
so where am i supposed to go ?
you' ve been exposed to them .
one way or another , somebody' s going to take you out .
there' s a war going on out there .
blade , myself , a few others , we' ve tried to keep it from spilling over onto the streets .
sometimes , people like yourself get caught in the crossfire .
i have blood samples .
i can go to the police .
they own the police .
you have to understand , they' re everywhere .
chances are you' ve seen them yourself and didn' t know it on the subway or in a bar .
so that' s it ?
you guys just patch me up and send me on my way ?
here .
vampire mace ... silver nitrate , essence of garlic .
you keep your eyes open .
be careful .
one other thing ... buy yourself a gun .
if you start getting sensitive to daylight ... if you find you' re thirsty regardless of how much you had to drink , then i suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself .
better that than the alternative .
you have been warned before .
these archives are restricted to members of the house of erebus .
you are wasting your time .
it' s a dead language .
the ancient texts can never be translated .
you wouldn' t even understand them .
damn it , frost !
i' m talking to you !
shh .
keep your voice down , gitano .
we' re in a library .
you don' t need to shout .
what are you up to , frost ?
what are you going to do , hmm ?
what ?
you bore me .
hey !
remember what we told you .
you keep your eyes open .
they' re everywhere .
but it' s daytime !
how you doing ?
hi there .
hey .
i' m sorry .
whoa , whoa !
whoa .
hold on , hold on , hold on .
police officer .
i' m sorry , ok ?
police officer .
i didn' t mean to scare you .
the front door was open .
what are you doing in here ?
i' m just here on a routine check .
look , i' m i' m officer krieger , 42nd precinct .
you' re karen jenson , right ?
yeah .
your co workers at the hospital said that you were kidnapped last night .
are you ok ?
what happened to the other doctor i was with ?
curtis webb ?
um , he died .
no , look , don' t worry about that right now , ok ?
why ?
because you' re dead , too , you bitch .
aah !
bitch !
what is it ?
what is this , garlic ?
yeah .
he said it would work against vampires .
vampires ?
who said i was a vampire , huh ?
nobody .
he' s a familiar a vampire wannabe .
if he' s loyal enough and he proves himself , maybe his master will turn him .
wait a minute .
you used me as bait ?
get over it .
is all that necessary ?
that' s a glyph a vampire cattle brand .
it means that officer krieger is somebody' s property .
another vampire tries to bleed this little hooker , then they have to answer to his owner .
deacon frost .
we' ve been tracking him for a long time .
all right .
officer krieger , you going to be a good little bloodhound , huh ?
tell us what your master' s been up to .
oh , great , now you' re robbing him .
you going to rob me , too ?
how do you think that we fund this organization , huh ?
we' re not exactly the march of dimes .
it' s fake .
well ...
looks like our friend here has been blood running , huh ?
hillbarn clinic .
i know this place .
it' s a blood bank .
owned by vampires , and there' s one in every city .
and they always deliver .
so , where were you taking it ?
i don' t know what you' re talking aah !
ooh !
look , take it easy .
i' m only going to ask you one more time .
where were you taking it ?
go fuck yourself .
fuck me ?
no , you fuck this .
you better wake up .
the world you live in is just a sugarcoated topping .
there is another world beneath it the real world .
and if you want to survive it , you better learn to pull the trigger .
wait a minute .
i' m coming with you .
you' re useless .
i have to stick with you .
it' s the only way that i' il stay alive long enough to find a cure for myself .
there is no cure .
he' s not going to come back .
nobody' s that stupid .
when you understand the nature of a thing , you know what it' s capable of .
it' s krieger .
i' m at 16 0 0 9 .
yes ?
get me through .
i got a delivery in progress here , and i just had a run in with blade .
i got to clear out that clinic on hillbarn now !
looks like we hit pay dirt .
that' s a vampire mark .
it means that there' s a safe house around here somewhere a place they can go with donors coming .
see the valets over there ?
they' re vampires .
so is the doorman and the whore on the corner .
how can you tell ?
by the way they move ... the way they smell .
psst .
it' s like a bad dream .
there are worse things out tonight than vampires .
like what ?
like me .
ok , vampire anatomy 101 .
crosses and holy water don' t do dick , so forget what you' ve seen in the movies .
you use a stake , silver , or sunlight .
you know how to use one of these ?
nope ... but i' il damn sure learn quick .
the safety' s off , rounds already chambered silver hollow point filled with garlic .
you aim for the head or the heart .
anything else is your ass .
do you have an invitation ?
what you got ?
kenji !
ohh !
where' s the entrance ?
i can' t tell you that , man .
uhh !
i' m going to ask you one more time .
where' s the entrance ?
ok .
ok .
it' s in the freezer .
come on , man !
i told you !
it' s in the fridge !
ok .
you give frost a message from me .
you tell him it' s open season on suckheads .
some kind of archive .
this must be where they keep most of their records .
isn' t this just a little high tech ?
they' ve got their claws into everything politics , finance , real estate .
they already own half of downtown .
frost throws a good party .
yeah ... but where is he ?
come on , baby .
don' t keep everyone waiting .
deacon , there' s someone here to see you .
i got to talk to you , frost .
i' m sorry .
i had to come here .
it' s a mistake going to pearl' s .
i know that .
dumb fucking me .
i know you' re disappointed .
am i that transparent ?
you want to meet him ?
yeah .
i can get you guys in with him , because we' re tight .
we' re like brothers .
fuck .
aw , fuck .
frost .
hey .
yeah .
deac .
deac .
i' ve been telling these bitches all about you , man .
they' ve been dying to meet you .
they are so psyched .
bad ass bitches .
they
hi .
deac ?
frost , it' s about blade .
aw , he' s busy , you know ?
because , like , when he' s focused on business ...
look , frost , this is important .
blade was waiting for me , using the girl as bait .
and you were stupid enough to take it .
shut up , bitch .
i didn' t know he was going to be there .
it was a trap , see ?
but don' t worry about it .
it' s no problem .
we can still get the girl .
yeah !
whoo !
forget the girl .
i want blade .
i know you do .
you hear me , quinn ?
i want him alive .
what ?
wait a minute , man .
you want him alive ?
what' s that smell ?
hlgh pltched volce : ... image carefully , frost .
you will need 12 purebloods to make the ritual work .
krieger , is that you ?
he he' s here !
he' s here !
this must be pearl , the record keeper .
he' s going to kill me !
you need me , frost !
you need me !
pearl , you' re history .
have the good grace to die with some fucking dignity .
frost .
ruthless bloodsucker .
congratulations , blade .
frost .
i hear you' ve been looking for me .
i' m flattered .
it' il pass .
fuck .
what is that ?
that , biscuit boy , is a u. v. lamp .
we' re gonna play a little game of 20 questions .
depending on how you answer , you may walk out of here with a tan .
what' s that ?
oh , that ?
oh , it' s nothing .
it' s routine research .
heh heh .
actually , it' s a video game .
that must' ve hurt .
it' s a fragment , a piece of the prophecy !
what prophecy ?
oh , i' m not really sure .
there are so many out
and there is nothing you can do about it , daywalker !
is that so ?
well , that' s what frost says .
then you won' t mind me borrowing this for a while , will you ?
if he moves , fry him .
what' s in here ?
nothing .
it' s a a storeroom .
but you' re wasting your time .
there' s nothing of importance to anyone .
then you won' t mind if i take a peek .
no !
he moved .
what is this ?
these are the pages from the book of erebus , the vampire bible .
it contains everything ... their entire history .
la magra must be one of their legends .
why is frost so interested in la magra ?
shh !
give me your hand .
do you remember me ?
give it to him !
hey !
hey !
nice one .
heh .
well , well , well .
you took my arm , man .
remember ?
but it' s cool .
i got a new one .
think i' il ever play piano again ?
you can slice him , you can dice him , but the quinn man just keeps on coming !
check it out .
i' ve got his pigsticker .
ah ha ha ha
ohh !
aah !
you' re a fuck up , crease !
ha ha ha ha !
you' re a fuck up !
i got his pigsticker !
ohh .
you' re just full of surprises , isn' t you , chief ?
stay with me , sweetness ...
' cause i' m not finished with you yet .
ah , looky here .
silver .
nice craftsmanship , huh ?
probably cost you a pretty penny .
now , this here is a man who takes his job ... just a little too seriously , don' t you think ?
come to think of it , blade ,
i owe you one .
actually , if you want to get technical , blade ...
i owe you two .
oh , what' s so funny , bright eyes ?
i' m expecting company .
catch you fuckers at a bad time ?
no !
no guns !
no !
no !
no !
no !
fucking this way !
drop the guns !
i need him !
he wants blade alive !
go !
you' ve been listening in the whole time ?
keeping radio contact .
think i' d let him run loose without a chaperon ?
christ !
i' m too old for this .
somebody get me a god damn wheelchair .
whistler !
he can take care of himself .
jump !
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah !
what are you gonna do ?
oh , my god .
what' s wrong ?
it' s dislocated .
ah !
let me help you .
aah !
let me give you
no !
get away .
you' re one of them , aren' t you ?
no .
i' m something else .
i found him when he was 13 .
he' d been living on the streets , feeding off the homeless .
his need for blood had taken over at puberty .
i took him for a vampire at first .
almost killed him , too .
then i realized what he was .
blade' s mother was attacked by a vampire while she was pregnant .
she died , but he lived .
unfortunately , he' d undergone certain genetic changes .
he can withstand garlic , silver , even sunlight , and he' s got their strength .
this time tomorrow , all those wounds of his will be healed .
he still ages like a human , though .
see , vampires age slower than us .
unfortunately ... he also inherited their thirst .
i thought the serum was supposed to suppress that .
time' s running out .
his body' s starting to reject it .
so far , all my efforts to find a cure have failed .
why do you hunt them ?
i had a family once wife and two daughters .
then a drifter came calling one evening , a vampire .
he toyed with ' em first , tried to make me decide which order they' d die in .
we kill as many of ' em as we can find , but it' s getting worse .
because of frost .
there' s something happening in the vampire ranks .
it' s something big ... and i' d stake my life that son of a bitch is at the center of it .
blade .
whistler told me what happened .
he told me what you are .
you don' t know me .
you don' t know anything about me .
i' m not human .
you look human to me
humans don' t drink blood .
that was a long time ago .
maybe you should let that go .
i have spent my whole life
looking for that thing that killed my mother .
it made me what i am .
and every time i take one of those monsters out ,
i get a little piece of that life back , so don' t you tell me about forgetting .
... my fault he took us by surprise !
two of them against your entire security force ?
don' t put that shit on me , ok , ' cause you were there , too !
i' m sure deacon will appreciate ... stabbed in the balls for it , all right ? !
aah !
you little skeez !
don' t see the lifestyle really suits you .
i should put this stump through that shit eating grin of yours .
face it , angel .
you were sloppy .
you got what you deserved .
deac , let me take this guy out , man .
look .
look what he fucking did !
he took my hand again !
listen to me .
i want him alive .
what the fuck are you talk you want him alive ?
we' ve been trying to kill this motherfucker for years .
are you out of your fucking mind ?
shh .
big guy , relax .
be patient .
now , we got a lot to do here .
i need you , man .
heh .
heh .
i need you .
yeah .
morning .
how you feeling ?
look at that .
whew .
getting a little toasty out here , huh ?
heh heh .
when was the last time you stopped to appreciate a good sunrise ?
oh , that' s right .
you were born a vampire , so you never had the pleasure , have you ?
that' s ok .
it' s all right .
least we' re here together .
share the moment , which means a lotto me , by the way , really .
i mean that .
' cause actually , you know , when you get to know me ,
i' m a fairly sentimental type of guy .
bit of an innocent , you might say .
do what you want , frost .
doesn' t make any difference .
you just don' t fucking get it .
you' re never gonna be a pureblood .
hold him .
you will never rule us .
aah !
aah !
ow .
jesus christ .
have a nice day .
sorry , you old dog .
you just got a little too long in the tooth .
what , man ?
that was funny .
long , tooth .
funny .
did i tell you the one about ...
aah !
what have you done with dragonetti ?
let' s get down to business , shall we ?
i need 12 volunteers .
tkktkk .
whistler .
what is this ?
smells like a vampire wiped his ass with it .
i took it from the archives .
it' s written in blood .
it' s from the book of erebus .
i think it' s what frost has been working on .
it' s something about the blood god , the spirits of the 12 .
i i don' t know .
i can' t make out the rest of it .
maybe this' il help .
i' il figure out something .
so what' s all this ?
took a trip to the hospital last night , borrowed some equipment .
for your miracle cure ?
this is e. d. t. a.
it' s an anticoagulant .
we use it to treat blood clots .
now look what happens when i introduce it onto a sample of vampire blood .
take a step back .
the reaction' s energetic .
some cure .
i didn' t say e. d. t. a. was a cure .
but maybe you could use it to explode some vampire heads .
wait a minute .
i need a sample of your blood .
later .
gotta go downtown .
need some serum .
serum can wait .
this is important .
is he sick ?
cancer .
you have a lot of love for him , don' t you ?
we have a good arrangement .
he makes the weapons .
i use ' em .
you know , my mother used to say ,
a cold heart is a dead heart .
you don' t look so good .
i' m just a little tired .
you know we' ve been ... working all night .
i guess we didn' t catch it in time .
you got another day , two at the most .
for what it' s worth , i' m sorry .
you make it sound like i' m already dead .
blade .
how you doing , chief ?
easy .
wouldn' t want our little friend here to wind up on the back of a milk carton , now would we ?
ah , it' s nice to finally meet you , man .
had my eye on you for years .
i know all about you your serum , whistler everything .
sunblock .
hey , it' s a start , right ?
the goal , of course , is to be like you , the daywalker .
you got the best of both worlds , don' t you ?
all our strengths ... none of our weaknesses .
well , maybe i don' t see it that way .
oh , so it' s back to pretending we' re human again ?
come on .
spare me the uncle tom routine , ok ?
you can' t keep denying what you are , man .
heh .
you think the humans will ever accept a half breed like you ?
they can' t .
they' re afraid of you .
and they should be .
you' re an animal .
you' re a fucking maniac .
look at ' em .
they' re cattle , pieces of meat .
what difference does it make how their world ends ?
plague ... war ... famine .
morality doesn' t even enter into it .
we' re just a function of natural selection , man , the new race .
looks like your mascara' s running .
i' m offering you a truce .
i want you with us .
what do you think , i' m stupid ?
you' re familiar with the blood god .
frost ... you' re nothing to me ... but another dead vampire .
you' re an idiot .
you know that ?
i came down here offering you an easy way out , and you spit it right back in my fucking face .
careful .
what do i care ?
they' re nothing but cattle ... just like you said .
if you want to take the hard road , be my guest , pal , but i promise you by the time this is over , you' re gonna wish they never cut you from your mother' s
aah !
go home .
it was simple .
why do vampires need to drink blood ?
' cause their own blood can' t sustain haemoglobin .
right .
so it' s a genetic defect , just like haemolytic anaemia .
that means that we have to treat it with gene therapy , rewrite the victim' s dna with a retro virus .
they' ve been using it on sickle cell anaemia .
are you sure that' s safe ?
i have no idea , but i don' t have a choice , do i ?
you actually think this could work ?
on me ... yes .
on blade , i' m not so sure .
see , he didn' t contract vampirism from a bite like i did .
he was born with it .
it' s it' s part of his dna .
i' m sure i can cure his thirst , but it' s gonna take time .
ah , we' re out of time .
you saw what was on that disc .
damn .
get out of here .
i said get out of here !
nice place .
took us a while to find it !
bite me and get it over with .
i ain' t gonna bite you .
do your thing .
whistler .
ohh .
frost took her .
listen to me .
the disc .
he decoded it .
frost is trying to ... trigger a fucking vampire apocalypse .
there' s some kind of ...
vampire god he' s trying to resurrect .
la magra .
you' re the key .
he needs your blood .
the blood of the daywalker .
you' re the chosen one .
listen to me , blade .
you can' t go after him .
bullshit .
if frost gets his hands on you , it' s all over .
there' il be armies of the motherfuckers .
shit .
you' re gonna have to finish me off .
don' t want me coming back .
we can treat the wounds .
it' s too far gone .
you know that .
give me your gun .
no .
give me the god damn gun .
now walk away , you stupid son of a bitch .
walk the fuck away .
by the time you watch this , your friend whistler should be dead .
if it makes any difference to you , he put up quite a fight .
you can find us at the edgewood towers .
you seem a bit ... tense .
a bit pent up maybe ,
like you need to release something .
you know ?
blade not ... giving it to you maybe .
i don' t know .
i just ...
i see such a beautiful woman .
great skin .
i' d like to see you happy , that' s all .
is this the part where you offer to turn me ?
well , it' s either that or a body bag .
go ahead .
bite me .
i' il just cure myself .
i did it before , and i can do it again .
there is no cure , baby .
there is if you' ve been bit , if you were once human .
how' d you get that scar , deacon ?
a born vampire would have the power to regenerate from birth .
you must' ve gotten scarred before you were turned .
isn' t that right ?
vampires like you aren' t a species .
you' re just ... infected , a virus ... a sexually transmitted disease .
i' il tell you what we are , sister .
we' re the top of the fucking food chain .
the blood god' s coming .
and after tonight , you people are fucking history .
he' s a hurricane , an act of god .
anyone caught in his path will instantly be turned .
everyone you' ve ever known , everyone you' ve ever fucking loved .
it won' t matter who' s pureblood and who' s not .
how are you gonna cure the whole fucking world ?
hmm ?
and blade' s blood is the key .
we got an intruder .
deac , i don' t think you understand .
i mean , this dude is fucking bad .
what ?
he' s , like , he had 20 guys around him and he' s got shit he throws at you
yeah , the swords .
throw it in the air , catch it underneath .
yeah .
shut the fuck up !
there' s no intruder where we are .
look , make it happen , all right ?
it' s one guy on foot .
that' s him !
get him !
why am i hearing gunfire ?
huh ?
did i tell anybody to start shooting ?
i need him alive .
no !
please !
i just work for them !
jesus christ .
lock this place down .
yes , sir !
aah !
aieee !
aah !
eric ?
but you died .
i came back , eric .
that very same night ... when deacon welcomed me into his arms .
uhh !
jesus christ .
i thought you' d be happy .
you' re finally being reunited with your mother , and you act like this ?
blade , give it up .
it' s over .
she belongs to me , buddy .
uh !
uhh !
don' t look so surprised .
you spent your whole life
looking for the vampire who bit your mother .
well , here i am .
who would ever guess you' d survive your mother' s death ?
but you did .
and here we are one big happy fucking family .
i need my serum .
maybe when we get outta this ,
i' il take that miracle cure of yours .
there' s one catch .
if it works , you' il lose your strength and your ability to regenerate .
you' il be completely human .
uhh !
blade , karen , glad you could make it .
hey , man .
thanks for the shades .
our ancestors called this place the temple of eternal night .
nice , isn' t it ?
apparently , these geniuses forgot it ever existed .
fortunately for us ...
i' m what you might call a ... student of history .
why are we here ?
this temple was built for one glorious moment this night , for the blood god .
thanks .
let' s see this sword of yours .
well .
titanium , right ?
acid etched ?
i' il get used to a weapon like this .
what ?
you look surprised .
i told you , blade ,
i know everything about you .
hold out your arm , quinn .
why , man ?
these are they' re , like , all better .
hold out your arm .
now .
deac , i
just kidding .
ha ha ha ha !
he was fucking with me .
he was , like , fucking ...
blade .
blade .
he can' t hear you , honey .
the thirst has got him now .
what do we have here ?
the precious serum .
mm .
how long' s it been since you shot up ?
12 , 13 hours maybe ?
i bet you' re just dying for a drink , aren' t you ?
what' s it feel like ?
is your blood on fire ?
try some .
you might like it .
thanks , but i prefer the real thing .
in any event ,
i don' t think you' il be needing these any more .
it' s a shame , you know ?
when i think of what you' ve become , what you should have become .
i guess i don' t blame you .
i mean , with everything that' s happened , it' s the human side of you that' s made you weak .
you should' ve listened to your blood .
say what you want , but i promise you , you' il be dead by dawn .
ooh .
get him outta here .
get these fucks downstairs .
now .
come on .
let' s go .
let' s go .
don' t worry , sweetheart .
we haven' t forgotten about you .
oh , no , baby .
we got something real special planned for you .
that surfer boy had a nice ass .
i sucked him dry .
and you' d figure he' d turn , man .
yeah , but he didn' t turn , did he ?
no .
he turned into some kinda zombie .
it happens sometimes , cutie .
he was fucking tripped out .
pathetic .
yeah .
these guys are complete scums , man .
they' il eat anything animals , rodents , corpses , and sometimes ...
they' il even eat vampires .
that' s a plus .
and bearing that all in mind ,
i' d like you to meet an old friend of yours .
uh !
uh !
it' s too bad .
i kinda liked her .
what a waste .
i don' t know what' s happening to me .
no pulse .
and , of course , there' s the question of lividity .
curtis ?
ahh .
karen ?
karen .
i never thought i would see you again .
tell me , karen , do you ever have second thoughts about us ?
karen !
karen !
karen !
karen !
karen .
karen !
poor child .
you' re so sick .
so thirsty .
don' t touch me .
eric , look at me .
vampires are my people now .
i' m one of them .
can' t be .
yes , it can .
try to understand , eric .
your mother died a long time ago .
i' ve hunted ...
i' ve killed ... and i' ve enjoyed it .
haven' t you ?
i know you have .
sooner or later , the thirst always wins .
come on .
spread them out .
one on each glyph , under the towers .
make it perfect .
yeah .
bring the elevator up .
you stupid girl .
what do you think is going to happen ?
la magra ?
the blood god ?
that' s nothing more than a fairy tale for pretty little vampires .
then why are you sweating , pureblood ?
you' re afraid we' re gonna steal your soul , your pureblood spirit .
you should be .
read the prophecy .
it' s time you fucks contributed something to the cause .
even if frost is right , you really think he cares about you ?
you' re gonna die , just like the rest of us .
waah !
blade .
tonight , the age of man comes to an end .
no more compromises .
we' re gonna be gods .
of course we are .
yeah !
i' m gonna be naughty .
