what is the meaning of this check ?
do you want me to cheat ?
no , i' m just the middleman .
are you trying to use me so you can get ahead when i fall .
look at this !
i' m the one and only golden leg !
you can only dream about that .
no ... i don' t .
i just want some kickback .
please don' t tell anyone .
you' re trash !
i' m sorry .
i' il see you later .
golden leg !
golden leg ...
golden leg ...
golden leg ...
hung , you' ve been a star player for twenty years , ever since fung missed the penalty kick and lost his golden leg ,
you' ve never had any rivals .
now that ...
oh no !
don' t talk about such things !
hung , your evil team has won the gold for 5 years running .
what' s your secret ?
secret ?
the secret is having a great soccer coach .
so , are you confident of winning gold again ?
are you a new reporter ?
i don' t think you should ask this kind of question .
excuse me ...
good morning , hung !
golden leg !
good morning , hung !
good morning !
hung , your shoe is dirty .
i' il help you clean it up .
it' s fine .
i can manage .
hung , i' il take your car over .
hung , you promised to offer a coaching job to me .
i' m ready .
i' m confident i can train a team as good as the evil team .
do you think you still can be a coach ?
forget it .
but you said ...
get real .
don' t you see ?
you' re a cripple now .
do you think you still can depend on that tattoo ?
hung , i' ve served you for 20 years .
how can you say such things .
today , i' m not in the mood .
things change .
you looked great when you were young .
you see , you' re just like my dog now .
forget it .
got lost .
i' ve already taken care of you for 20 years now .
you know , you' ve cost me a lot of money .
hung ! you' re too vain !
if you hadn' t given me that kick back check 20 years ago ...
i wouldn' t be crippled now .
what ?
getting angry ?
yell louder !
hey !
you guys hear that ?
thousands of reporters outside .
should i invite them in ?
you know ...
i keep you here to keep you quiet .
would anyone believe a crippled beggar like you ?
you !
don' t be angry .
if you want to blame anyone , blame yourself .
blame your own greediness .
forget it .
i' il tell you another thing .
i was the one that arranged the accident to your leg .
damn it !
that' s no way to kick a ball .
pardon ?
i said that' s no way to kick a ball .
so what' s your opinion ?
there has to be a fusion of the strength from the waist to the foot .
what' s that " from the waist to the foot " ?
yes , from the waist to the foot .
my idol bruce lee has already spoken on the subject .
if you want to learn more , you can take two kung fu lessons from me .
learn kung fu from you ?
you just look like a cleaner .
cleaner is just my job .
my real identity is a postgraduate student .
postgraduate student ?
studying how to effectively develop shaolin kung fu .
here' s my business card .
shaolin orthodox school mighty stal leg .
look !
it' s really strong .
fighting is not my style .
i' m an well educated man .
you' re wrong .
do you see that girl ?
i know she' s sexy , so what ?
but i' m an educated ...
no , no , no , no .
watch it ... watch it ... watch it ... watch it ... watch it ...
if she had learned shaolin kung fu , weight vest , she would not have fallen like that .
you see !
so shaolin kung fu is great !
hey !
do you want to learn kung fu ?
you' re crazy !
look at the woman over there .
if she had studied shaolin fung fu , iron hand , parking would be much easier .
so kung fu is wonderful !
excuse me !
do you want to learn ...
okay ... get lost you !
you should share the money with me .
don' t ruin our new friendship !
look at that !
what' s wrong ?
you' ve already spent a whole year to trim the tree .
you' re fired .
get away !
i' m sorry ...
get away !
if he had studied shaolin kung fu , nine fence of the recluse , he would not be in trouble !
i think nine fence of the recluse came from hua shan .
don' t you know all kung fu styles originated from shaolin ?
kung fu is absolutely good for different ages .
brutality is just the wrong impression of kung fu .
kung fu is an art ,
one kind of indomitable spirit .
i' m looking for a good way to package shaolin kung fu ... to let people understand its true meaning .
enough , already !
i' ve not finished yet .
almost finished .
i still have some appointments with my clients .
we' re done .
please seize your opportunity !
the lame can also learn kung fu .
what are you talking about ?
who' s the lame ?
you' re not qualified to talk soccer with me .
i' m sorry !
yes , i' m lame , but it' s none of your business .
the lame ?
bullshit !
what ... what ?
you scaring me ?
do you still want the garbage ?
if you don' t , i' il call the other one .
i' m coming over .
hurry up !
get out of here ...
excuse me !
would you help me put it over there ?
no problem !
your leg is so great !
twenty cents !
oh , no !
just twenty cents ?
there are some cups and plates inside .
would you give me ten more cents ?
wah , move it over there .
mui , please give me ten steamed breads !
using tai chi kung fu to make steamed bread is a startling idea .
the steamed bread looks sweet and tasty .
i' m so impressed by her strong arms .
you ...
what are you doing ?
singing is the proper way for me to express my true feelings of esteem .
wow !
so beautiful !
i' m not beautiful .
don' t laugh at me !
you see !
the steamed bread is so great !
tastes wonderful !
your tai chi kung fu , shifting bodies and transposing shadows ...
it' s a firm but gentle kung fu , shove a thousand cattle with four tales .
well !
that' s why the steamed bread is so tender and firm .
fifty cents each .
two steamed breads is one dollar .
so expensive .
really .
even though it' s so expensive , it' s worth it .
i just have fifty cents right now .
may i pay you in 2 days ?
ok .
well !
you' re a typical kung fu master , speaking with grace and ease .
you know , we are both shaolin masters .
would you give me a face saving permission ?
yes .
okay !
these valuable sneakers originally cost 2 dollars .
now , i' il let you have them cheap .
one dollar fifty cents , and i' il take one steamed bread more .
call the police !
okay !
why don' t you give me permission ?
ah !
you' re so beautiful ...
shut up !
stop singing , please .
put down your money and get away right now .
if you like singing , you should go up to that mountain .
only crazy people sing up here .
i don' t agree with this girl .
it' s not crazy for anyone to sing here .
this is exploding .
i' il never give up my dream ... ... of becoming a composer .
this gentleman' s song is ... ... so creative and full of enthusiasm .
thank you !
you' re welcome .
his song has touched me deeply and draws out my enthusiasm .
at this moment , i' ve a feeling that ...
i should explode .
even if i' m just a butcher , i can also dream of being a dancer .
great !
have you guys got nothing to do right now ?
stand straight !
put your hands down !
stretch your neck !
you' re nuts !
you can' t dance here .
really ?
i just went out to do my facial .
i couldn' t imagine that you had already made a mess here .
why did this crazy guy come here ?
you' re so ferocious , shouting at everyone .
i came here to buy streamed bread .
is my steamed bread ready ?
coming !
wait a minute !
did the guy pay for the steamed bread ?
he did .
what' s this dirty stuff ?
throw it away !
first big brother !
first big brother !
it' s okay !
keep working .
clean it up , please !
are you sick , first big brother ?
i' ve a headache .
i got drunk last night .
anyway , what do you want ?
i want to let you know i awakened already .
truly ?
you awakened .
i awakened .
i finally understood .
if i want to develop shaolin kung fu for the world ,
i need to package it in a new form .
what kind of form ?
singing !
you won' t believe what i saw today .
i saw a steamed bread shop ...
stop bothering me !
but , what do you think if i combine shaolin kung fu ... with singing and dancing ?
forget it .
how will you know until you try it ?
forget it !
i already told you to quit dreaming .
there' s a toilet cleaning job .
you should take it ... and quit dreaming .
if we don' t have dreams in life , we' il look like a salt fish .
you see , you' re a real salt fish without a pair of shoes !
how can you talk about a dream ?
oh , no !
the fire in my heart is not easy to put out !
why not ?
just blow it out !
but i can light it up again !
enough , already !
we have our own separate lives .
stop bothering me !
i work to support my family .
you mean you are willing to give up your iron head ?
did you forget how long you trained for it ?
you' re wrong !
i didn' t give it up ... for even one day !
fei !
boss !
damn it !
the dancers quit the show already .
how can you stay here and do nothing about it ?
no !
i have a great idea .
what' s that ?
combining shaolin kung fu with singing and dancing .
what kind of shaolin kung fu ?
look at this .
it' s no good for a show .
he' s good enough .
no !
how about you ?
me ?
shit !
how about your iron head ?
if you don' t do it well , i' il kill you tomorrow .

what are you singing about ?
your voice sound like howling .
the lyric is disgusting .
i even can' t understand one sentence of this .
yes , of course .
who wrote this lyric ?
who did ?
who did ?
creative work is highly subjective , but i must answer your criticism .
singing is just the beginning of the show .
the highlight is the performance of mighty stal leg and iron head !
iron head ?
i had already told you that you wrote the bad lyric .
i' m not iron head .
he' s ...
lron head ?
i said ...
lron head ?
mighty stal leg !

let' s listen to music !
you crazy guys !
let' s see if you can take more !
thank you !
bullshit !
what ?

nothing interested !
do you still want to fight with us ?
i promised my shaolin master i wouldn' t use kung fu to fight with anyone .
this guy is crazy .
but all you guys should apologize !
apologize ?
i shouldn' t have to . . it' s all you guys fault !
don' t move !
you said you wouldn' t use kung fu to hit anyone .
i' m not coming for fighting .
i' m coming to play soccer .
shit !
you don' t need to be so exaggerated !
what ?
i' m so sorry !
do you have some money right now ?
yes .
thirty cents .
are you grabbing my money ?
yep .
did you learn tong long fist ?
i did .
don' t insult shaolin kung fu anymore !
ok .
would you let me take a look at your leg ?
i' m not in the mood .

it' s the real , original kung fu .
a great killer slim leg .
it' s shaolin mighty stal leg !
is it possible to use kung fu to play soccer ?
truly use kung fu ?
yes , of course !
yeah !
it' s a great idea to use kung fu to play soccer .
why didn' t i ever think about that ?
are you the lame ?
i' m not just the lame .
i' m the ex soccer player , golden leg .
now , i' m a soccer coach .
that' s great !
you should teach me to play soccer .
hold on .
no !
you told me i could use kung fu to play soccer .
but i need time to consider !
i' ve no time to think anymore !
it' s sunset already !
time doesn' t wait for anyone !
but we still need to prepare !
i' m ready !
what do i need ?
at least a pair of shoes !
do you have money to get your sneakers back ?
no .
but ...
i threw them away .
oh , my god !
your sneakers were worn out and broken .
yes , they were broken .
but i ...
go home !
my boss will yell at you if she comes back and sees you .
i can' t get the broken ones back .
there is a repaired pair .
do you want to have it ?
first big brother , what are you doing ?
first big brother , are you okay ?
i' m fine .
what do you want ?
i finally got a good idea ... to promote shaolin kung fu .
this is for playing soccer !
please let me go !
you had already got me into trouble .
i was fired .
now , i work in the rest room to pay for my boss' s loss .
so i come here to help you .
no !
absolutely not !
if you force me anymore , my whole family will commit suicide in front of you .
committing suicide is not a good way to solve any problems .
be brave !
don' t be so silly !
i' m such a loser !
please don' t come here anymore !
if you still want to form a soccer team , you can call the other brothers .
please , don' t bother me !
i beg you !
lron head .
good morning , fourth big brother !
good morning , sing !
how are you ?
let me introduce a great guy to you !
he' s ...

i know , fung is so famous in the stock exchange market .
you see !
he has a great i. t. look .
fung is a soccer coach .
soccer coach !
everyone knows that fung is the most ... famous figure in the soccer field .
do you use your legs to play soccer ?
you see !
i' m right .
actually , do you have any job ?
i want you to join into my soccer team ?
playing soccer ?
i' ve no job for six months .
how can you ask me to play soccer ?
if you can use your empty hand ...
what' s empty hand ?
that was a long time ago .
you know , i even forgot when our master died .
please listen to me !
we' re going to sign up the national soccer tournament .
the prize is one million dollars .
really ?
so i say you' re the smartest one .
you see !
you' re dressed up .
many years ago , our master ordered us to develop shaolin kung fu .
now , you guys get this great idea of using shaolin kung fu to play soccer
you see !
this' s the group picture of our master and brothers .
i always keep it under my pillow .
you should know what i mean .
great !
let' s sit down to talk about what you mean .
i' il call you if i' ve time .
remember , please save a place for me .
no time to talk now .
some clients waiting for me .
i should keep my eyes on the stock market .
my trades are for hundreds of thousands each .
hello ?
what' s the price now ?
today , my driver' s off .
i just lent my car to my friend , and i left my wallet in my office .
i' m sorry !
no time for lunch with you guys .
i' m too busy .
get away from me !
third big brother , think about it !
if you can use iron shirt to be the back ...
what' s lron shirt ?
you see !
there are planes in the sky .
there are computers on the street .
it' s the 21st century .
stop living in a dreamworld !
but i think it' s a good idea to combine kung fu with soccer .
it' s true !
and there' s a large prize .
for christ sake !
you think i' m ...
my trades are hundreds of thousand dollars each .
there' s no way i' il give up trading to play soccer .
i' m sorry .
you know , i' m so direct ...
it' s impossible to give up my trading and sign up to play soccer with you guys .
forgive me .
i' m an honest guy .
finally , it' s also impossible for me to win a fucking soccer game .
truly , the probability of winning is 0 % .
probabil ...
probability !
okay ...
it will be heads , or it will be tails .
it' il never stand on end .
so the probability is 0 % .
let me try .
get away !
i' ve an appointment with my client at a coffee shop .
get away !
we can have a quick noodle lunch at a stall .
bullshit !
my trades are for hundreds of thousands dollars each .
how can i go eat noodles with you guys ?
he' s my sixth small brother , weight vest .
this is the famous soccer coach , fung .
fung , how are you ?
what vest ?
weight vest
nice to meet you !
mr. vest .
fifth big brother , are you thinking about playing soccer ?
yes , if you can use shaolin kung fu , you can play forward with me .
our attack should be flawless .
are you sure about this ?
of course .
great !
do you have any diet pills ?
it' s hopeless .
since the virus get into the cerebellum , there' s no way for me to lose any pounds .
after i became like this , i' m unable to use shaolin kung fu weight vest , or even to walk quickly .
yes , you' re a little bit fat , but it' s not so important .
forget it !
you see , it was my picture !
since i' ve become like this ,
i even can' t date a girl .
you can' t understand that .
i do .
i also can' t date a girl !
really ?
there has been much gossip about your girls in the papers .
what papers ?
oh !
i' m sorry !
since i' ve this disease , i can' t control myself .
i' m sorry .
please leave me alone !
small brother !
you should have confidence !
you can do it !
now , everyone calls me lazy pig ...
you know , you' re the only one who calls me small brother .
thank you !
lazy pig , please help me to get the red package of tissue .
the red one !
playing soccer ?
yes , second big brother !
if you can use hooking leg to be the back ,
our defense will be flawless !
absolutely
don' t you think i still can use hooking leg ?
you just need some practice .
if you trust yourself , you will get your hooking leg back .
really ?
i just saw you collecting excrement and urine recently .
why did you change your job to washing dishes ?
why ?
why do you care ?
i don' t understand , either .
why isn' t my dad the richest guy , lee ka sing ?
why am i going bald , even though i' m so handsome ?
you guys are not going bald , but you' re so ugly .
why could the other guys go to school when they were young ,
but i was forced to study the shaolin kung fu , and then become a dish washer , or collect urine and excrement ?
calm down , second big brother !
if you have courage , you can control your fate .
calm down ?
if i didn' t calm down ,
i would kill you guys !
calm down ?
why are you just sitting there ?
didn' t you smell anything disgusting ?
if it stinks when i come back , you' il clean it with your tongue !
your apartment is great !
it' s well furnished .
i can' t imagine you work as the cleaner downstairs , but live in the penthouse on the 59th floor .
you' ve good taste !
this kind of apartment is so popular .
i can' t even get one .
this place is okay .
just little bit noisy .
would you mind if i move here ?
forget it !
your brothers are not good .
we can find some others to join our team .
it was all my fault .
i couldn' t persuade them .
it' s okay .
you know , i' m so glad that you trust me .
thank you .
we' il have a short training period to teach you ... to be professional soccer players .
so you should be serious and mutually support each other .
i understand !
let' s go !
please listen to me !
what would you do if you were in my position ?
yes , of course .
i' ve a call .
hold on a second .
the ball is coming back down !
what are you doing ?
playing soccer !
the ball is over there !
the ball is over here .
let me see you kick the ball here .
the ball is over there .
yes , over there !
you can' t even get the ball .
how can you kick it from here ?
pass , stop , hold and kick .
i understand !
don' t move !
okay .
start from the beginning .
yours .
hold it .
watch out !
concentrate !
concentrate !
come on !
move !
yes ... you need more cone work .
almost fine .
it' s great training .
do more work with the cones .
fung , why can' t i take part in the training ?
even though your leg is so strong , you can' t control it well
what if you kick the ball into the sky ... and then hit a plane ?
can you pay for it ?
no .
so ...
sixth small brother !
i' m borrowing your eggs !
what ?
if you can control the egg well in the air , you can play soccer .
no problem !
okay !
go ahead .
it' s not easy .
sixth small brother , forget it !
oh , my god !
my egg !
i' il replace it later !
no way !
give it back to me !
concentrate ...
my egg !
yes !
yes !
yes !
yes !
yours !
right ...
good ...
yes !
go !
mark that one !
watch out !
how can you let him kick the ball ?
kick it !
come on !
it' s great !
he can just play it by himself .
no !
it' s teamwork .
there' s no way just for one to play soccer .
each half is 30 minutes .
there is no break .
we' il follow the international rules .
i' m the referee .
do you have any questions ?
don' t be silly ?
you know , how great golden leg is as referee ... and he leads a young soccer team to play with us .
we are very happy about that !
this' s fung ! fung !
okay .
enough .
this guy has some problems with your team' s players .
now , this game is an exchange of our skills of playing soccer .
it is used to solve this conflict .
you see !
they play sincerely .
from their tidy uniform and friendly face ,
i can deeply feel their sincerity and the spirit of physical culture .
thank you !
calm down .
i' m an auto mechanic .
this crescent wrench is used for turning bolts .
does that make any sense ?
yes , of course .
i explained it already .
because i' m a car repairer , it' s all right for me to have a hammer .
okay .
your team' s style ... is very famous in the amateur soccer world .
i understand .
it' s an undeserved reputation .
seems the clouds in the sky ...
okay .
anyway , take care of yourselves .
shake hands , please !
great !
help !
third big brother !
call the military base , we' ve just suffered a fierce attack .
ask for reinforcements !
ask for reinforcements !
stand up .
stand up !
stand up quickly !
stand up quickly !
what are you doing ?
coach , they are lawless .
why don' t you stop them ?
i' m the referee .
i don' t have to stop them .
why not ?
do you want us to lose ?
you !
out !
are you nuts ?
this is a test .
if you guys can' t pass it , then we don' t deserve to win !
it' s only a game .
we' re not fighting a war .
soccer really is like war .
i surrender !
i surrender !
i surrender !
i surrender !
i surrender !
if you wanted me to play , why did you surrender ?
do you play to lose ?
i can' t stand it anymore .
my bone seems broken .
i' m a pitiful creature !
please let me go to see a doctor !
put it on your head !
you see .
you look like a dog .
have you no self respect ?
i don' t want to see you .
put it on your head and go see a doctor .
yes , i' m a dog .
i don' t have any self respect .
first big brother is coming back .
what ?
i' ve a feeling that they' re back .
do we still have any weapons ?
none !
the final attack !
oh , my god !
i couldn' t get it .
help !
