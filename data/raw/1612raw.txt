every life is a riddle .
the answer to mine is a knowledge born of darkness .
it wasn' t always so .
in the beginning , i still had questions .
in the beginning , my mystery still remained .
brother dominic ... scholar of the catholic arcane .
believer in the unsanitized church .
a church that no longer believes in itself .
the church of stigmata ... and exorcism , saints ... and demons ... and me .
i believe in many things .
so do i.
and right now , i believe it' s time .
are you ready to make your confession ? .
forgive me , alex .
i have sinned against you .
there he is .
that' s alex .
he' s young .
but an old soul , clive .
he' s an old soul .
mea culpa .
mea culpa .
mea maxima culpa .
corpus christi ?
amen .
corpus christi ?
amen .
corpus christi ?
amen .
i need to speak with you .
do you always say the mass in latin ?
it' s how i was taught .
it belies your age .
and with your back to your audience , no less .
you know , six or 700years ago ... they wouldn' t have seen you at all .
you' d have sung the mass in latin behind a huge choir screen ... out of the sight of a congregation who was only allowed to ...
listen .
i think you would have liked the choir screen , alex .
you' re a contradiction .
what i am is stuck here because the church doesn' t know what to do with me .
well , the church doesn' t know what the hell to do with itself .
look , i won' t pretend i don' t know you have certain qualifications ... certain skills , that set you apart from other priests .
however , the diocese has certain questions about your faith , alex .
so , what do you want from me ? .
well , i have sad news for you .
dominic , the head of your order  i know who he is .
he' s dead .
today .
in rome .
is this your mother ?
say good bye , alex .
it' s time to say good bye .
good bye .
leave your tears here and then forget them .
alex ?
alex ? .
alex ? .
how is it that a cardinal has enough time to come and tell me this ? .
because i loved him .
because he was my mentor .
because the circumstances of his death are ... curious .
i need to go to rome .
the diocese will arrange a flight .
in the name of god , in the name of jesus christ , i order you back to hell .
your time is coming .
in the name of god , in the name of jesus christ , i order you back to hell .
in the name of god , in the name of jesus christ , i order you back to hell .
fuck your god !
all mouth , no trousers .
your church will be lost , priest .
the dark pope ... rises .
hello ? .
ah , thomas .
i' ve been trying to reach you , mate .
alex .
how are you , spaghetti ? .
yeah , listen to me .
dominic died .
dominic ? .
yeah .
ah , no .
when did it happen ? .
last night .
where are you ? .
in new york ? .
at st. anthony' s ? .
yeah .
listen , i' m going to rome , thomas .
when ? .
tomorrow .
and guess what .
so are you .
just be there .
hi .
hi .
when did they release you ? .
i was released today .
years ago , it was a dorm for all the priests .
now it' s empty .
you' re here .
true .
oh , i' il wait .
uh , we' re looking for alex bernier .
that' s me .
is there something wrong ? . just a heads up , father .
you know a ...
mara williams ? .
yes .
she escaped today from the mental health facility where she was remanded by the court .
remanded , huh ? .
and what does this have to do with me ? .
well , she was locked up for trying to kill you , wasn' t she ? .
that was the main reason , yes .
i just thought you d like to know she' s unaccounted for .
look , i could have a car drive by here once in a while .
no , i' m fine .
thank you .
well , like i said , a heads up .
you know , it says here i couldn' t make it out in this copy that she , uh that she shot you at an exercise class ? .
no , at an exorcism .
oh .
have a good night .
you , too , father .
you lied .
you said they released you .
no , i didn' t .
i didn' t lie .
i said i was released .
i didn' t say who did it .
mara ? .
alex ... you didn' t say good bye .
they said it would be better that i didn' t see you for a while .
for a year ? .
i don' t know .
i started painting again .
did you ? .
yeah .
flowers mostly .
i wanna paint sunflowers , but i don' t have the guts .
do you think i' m crazy ? .
i know you' re not .
why' d you come here ? .
i heard you call me .
mara , don' t say that .
okay , i got a feeling ... that i should be with you ... in case one of us has to say good bye .
i' ve never been to rome before .
is it amazing ?
i bet it is .
it scares me ever since i was a boy .
and you' re staying here .
no , i' m not staying here .
i can' t stay here .
and you need me whether you know it or not .
and ? .
the nightingales are gone .
are they ? .
yeah .
they' ve been gone for about a year .
same as you .
alex , look at me .
it' s you and me .
you and me till the wheels fall off .
promise you won' t try to kill me .
cross my heart , hope to die .
it' s here .
hey .
mara ? .
what are they ? .
orphans .
but of what i have no idea .
i' ve been in worse places .
it just needs light , that' s all .
what are those ? .
aramaic .
it' s the language of christ .
what does it say ? .
barath mae .
blood in .
down there , barath sec .
blood out .
this must have been where they found dominic' s body .
alex , what are you thinking ? .
it was a ceremony .
the message i got said suicide .
sleeping pills , signore .
is that him ? .
yes , it' s him .
thank you .
no , no .
i didn' t pay to look at his face .
if you don' t mind .
what are these ? .
okay , let' s go , please .
hurry up .
no , no , no .
what are these ? .
do you know what these are ? .
maybe a birthmark .
i don' t know .
i' m not a doctor .
that' s not a birthmark .
when' s the body due to be released to the church ? .
it isn' t .
when we are done with it , it goes to the state ... for burial in the state cemetery .
okay .
please , let' s go .
please .
come with me .
it' s always nice to see a priest .
and a carolingian , no less .
you' ve seen others ? .
a dominic sousa , perhaps ? .
carolingians ... you surpass even the jesuits in your heretical search for knowledge .
it' s important to stay inside the lines .
what lines ? .
this way .
those were the marks .
dominic , what were you doing ? .
bread and salt eaten off the body ... the sins of one man consumed by the other " '
a sin eater .
if hitler had had one in the bunker , he' d be sitting on a cloud right now .
of course , sin eaters ... haven' t existed for two centuries , have they ? .
what did dominic buy from you ? .
many things over the years .
last time , a vellum parchment written in aramaic .
what did it say ? .
i' m not as clever as dominic ... scholar of mysteries .
he delved deep and dark .
always after knowledge .
i think he' d have sold his soul for knowledge .
do you ? .
his heretic soul or something precious to him .
is there a price tag on your head ? .
what' s that supposed to mean ? .
sometimes it' s better for a priest not to know .
knowledge is the enemy of faith .
and sometimes when you look into the abyss ... the abyss looks back into you .
look , his order meant everything to him .
now , dominic should be buried with his order in the concezione cemetery .
your order .
his former order .
the carolingians , not many of you left in the world .
yeah , a dying breed .
look , and when they die , it' s the concezione cemetery .
suicide is a cardinal sin .
dominic didn' t commit suicide .
it makes no difference .
he had been excommunicated , excluded from our society and sacraments .
there is no salvation outside the church " '
yes , i know my latin .
unlike your manners .
respect what you are .
well , what i am is my concern .
thank you .
listen , i' m sorry .
i am .
i [ exhales ]
i need the theosophic council to convene as soon as possible .
the council ? .
it hasn' t convened in years .
for what purpose ? .
tell them i found a sin eater .
a sin eater ? .
here ? .
at the start of the new millennium ? .
how many other impossible things do you believe in ? .
it' s not impossible .
i' ve seen the marks on dominic' s body myself .
your mentor was excommunicated ... for rejection of articles of faith .
heresy .
accept it .
he took his own life because he couldn' t bear that .
grazie , franca .
father alex .
ciao , maria .
ciao .
grazie .
in nomine patris , et filii , et spiritus sancti .
amen .
i n the name of god ...
i command you to return from whence you came .
i n the name of god
in the name of jesus , god , and the holy virgin , i order you back to hell !
well , off to hell yourself .
what kind of a greeting' s that ? .
you' re late .
never too late , alex .
witness the repentant thief ... crucified alongside our lord savior .
quick thinker , eh ? .
how you doing ' ? .
ah , i' m grand .
so , did you bury him ? .
yeah .
rogue priest reading ' rites over an excommunicado .
damn dirty job , but someone' s gotta do it .
well , cheers .
to the last of the carolingians .
you and me .
cheers .
what just passed through here , alex ? .
demon spawn in the guise of children .
nothing i couldn' t handle .
who summoned those nasties up ? .
dominic , i think .
they were camped outside his apartment .
oh , speaking of the apartment , i met your girlfriend .
she' s not my girlfriend .
well , she should be .
she said you' d be at the concezione .
you told her it was a restaurant ? .
well , she would have come with me otherwise .
oh , women .
can' t live with ' em .
can' t live with ' em .
come on .
sin eater .
come on .
sin eater .
in absolution , the burden of guilt ...
would be transmuted to the sin eater ... as would the knowledge of the transgressions " '
wait .
you mean he' d know what your sins were ? .
even the details ? .
he' d know them and feel the burden of them .
he' d spend sleepless nights over things others had done .
he' d have the ascendancy to free a man' s soul .
and damn his own .
we' re carolingians , alex and i.
now , in a way , that makes us responsible .
they say the practice of sin eating began with banished members of our order .
come on .
that' s like saying that sheep ... are responsible for the sweaters that get made from their wool .
maybe they are , mara , girl .
i found the vellum dominic bought .
i' il translate it for you .
okay ...
place the instrument of delivery over the heart " '
it must be some kind of weapon .
and then look .
barath mae , barath sec . ' " blood in , blood out .
and drive into the heart " ' now , the rest is missing .
still , you get the idea .
i' m not sure i do .
well , they' re instructions ... on how to kill a sin eater .
dominic trained us to deal with ghosts and demons and all manner of undead ... but this sin eater , he' s a living man .
well , whatever he is , he killed dominic .
maybe , maybe not .
i' ve seen another copy of this somewhere .
so , we meet again .
jesus , the fuckin ' cavalry .
so , how are you finding our city of emperors , our city of martyrs ? .
would you care for a beer , your eminence ?
or something a little stronger ?
and you are ? .
he' s thomas .
she' s mara .
we' re the catholic pete , linc and julie .
well , i am michael cardinal driscoll , and among other things ...
i' m head of the theosophic council .
a bit like the dead letter department of the post office , i' m afraid .
i believe michelangelo went blind from candlelight .
dominic didn' t believe in electricity .
yes , but a sin eater ? .
you couldn' t have shocked the bishop more if you d said ... you' d been possessed by some phoenician demon and then demanded an exorcism .
the exorcism was on friday .
well , today is monday .
and yet , i think there may be credence to what you say .
matter of fact , i know there is .
a sin eater a renegade who provides a path to heaven outside of the church , outside of our savior .
if you believe such things , he has the power ... to grant redemption to the unrepentant .
sort of a heretical wrench in the cogs of our catholic machinery .
you two were dominic' s chosen .
what do you know about his excommunication ? .
nothing .
he wouldn' t speak of it .
well , dominic believed this other ... this man was based right here in rome .
now , that' s all i know because that' s all he told me ... and i assume that the two of you plan to seek him out .
otherwise , i am just spinning my wheels here .
sadly , the church no longer has the will to dispatch .
thank god we still have the tools .
the instrument of delivery , if you will .
now , if you il excuse me ... there are even more pressing matters weighing on the vatican tonight .
signorina .
what could be more important than this ? .
they say the pope is ill .
i n fact , they say that he' s dying .
and that man , mara , girl , that american is front runner for the job .
that man that just asked you to kill somebody ? .
left it to our discretion , i' d say .
where' d you get that ? .
last year .
got drunk , woke up with it .
that' s very strange .
sailors get anchors , so i' m a priest .
it' s still strange , tommy .
i' m glad dominic believed in bathrooms .
i usually just open the window and lean out .
what' s strange is that you re a priest sleeping on the couch ... instead of a man sleeping in bed with her .
thomas , two days ago , she was in a mental institution .
so , she' s crazy about you .
can you look me in the eye and tell me you still wanna be a priest ? .
can you ? .
there are other ways to serve .
hmm , to serve .
it' s knowledge i' m after .
knowledge .
when i look under a rock , my gut reacts to what i see .
i don' t wonder how it got under the rock to begin with .
you guys tired ? .
go upstairs and get some sleep .
good night .
night .
sweet dreams , yeah ? .
you too .
i know who she is , but who is she ? .
tell me something about her .
hmm .
she' s a she' s a painter .
really good too .
i don' t know , there' s something about her that
she sees things differently .
she feels things differently .
i wish i never saw her face .
alex , you' re a fool .
same as you were once .
alex, your head rules your heart .
oh , and what rules yours ? .
laughter , of course .
hey , hey , you laugh to keep from going mad .
you laugh to keep the wolves at bay .
it' s still laughter .
as for you , spaghetti , choose life .
right .
let your heart wear the crown , not your head .
here we are .
time to see chirac .
who is he anyways ? .
a rising darkness .
a rising darkness ? .
we' re looking for rosalinda .
sure .
she' s over there .
girl with the faraway eyes .
we need you to take us to chirac .
don' t start your posturing , you pagan worshipping pig .
you owe me a debt .
my friend and i are looking for the other .
just what does he mean by the dying ? .
ask him .
oh , shit .
uh [ exhales ]
where where can i find the sin eater ? .
the other will find you .
upon the stone where all is built [ gasping ]
he brings you claves ... regni caelorum .
claves regni caelorum ?
the keys to the kingdom of heaven .
upon the stone where all is built .
upon the stone where all is built .
ah , i hate riddles .
petrus , stone .
petram .
peter is the stone upon which all , right , the church is built .
st. peter' s .
well , the other will find me then .
st. peter' s .
doesn' t anyone just meet for coffee anymore ? .
and he will bring you claves regni  [ gasps ]
alex !
come on .
let' s get out of here .
thomas .
thomas .
no point in hanging ' around .
thomas !
tommy , love .
how long have you been a priest , thomas ?
certain pleasures are forever out of reach .
denied .
thomas !
leave it for a sunny day .
come on .
al i mouth and no trousers .
remember that girl in dublin ?
megan was her name .
did you feel foolish , tommy ?
in love with a whore .
thomas ? .
it' s personal .
ignore it .
the first and only lesson , remember ?
tommy love .
oh , tommy .
i love you , tommy .
come on , mate .
never give them an inch .
tommy .
not one fucking inch !
thomas ? .
thomas !
thomas !
i n the name of god and jesus christ ... to hell with you !
i love you , tommy .
i' il pray for you , tommy .
thomas !
shit !
i said there was no point in hanging around .
you never laugh , alex .
it' s not good for the soul .
i thought you might be the nurse .
thomas , what happened ? .
where' s alex ? .
he' s off in search of coffee .
as for me , i was hoisted up by me own petard .
mara , if i can ask ... what happened between you and alex ? .
it' s okay .
if i was embarrassed , i' d wear bracelets .
my little brother was murdered , and they brought alex in to consult .
the filmore murders .
dominic sent alex .
that was his first time on his own .
mara , i hear confession all the time .
nightingales .
what about them ? .
those are the birds that i' d hearsinging ... right before the headaches started .
these headaches , they' d go on for weeks .
they were ... blinding .
so , i did this , and even that didn' t help .
alex performed an exorcism .
yeah .
alex took away my pain ... and i fell in love with a priest who couldn' t love me back .
love .
you traded one pain for another .
something terrible is going to happen to alex , thomas .
i don' t know what it is ... but i know that it' s worse than death .
am i the answer to your prayer ?
my friends call me william .
william eden .
i' m not your friend .
that remains to be seen .
i know what you re feeling , alex , and you' re right .
god exists .
he just doesn' t give a damn .
magnificence .
flesh rots .
st. peter' s remains .
this impossible dome , alex ... it was raised by my brother when i was still a boy .
blood and sweat built this ... not faith .
it was michelangelo who drew the dome on a piece of paper ... but it was left to my brother to figure out a way ... to raise it halfway to heaven ... and it was my honor , each day to bring him something to eat ...
and ask him of the world outside of my own .
papa ? .
hey , will i i' am .
you brought some food .
thank you .
tell me a story , phillip , a story of jerusalem .
jerusalem ? .
phillip !
phillip !
phillip !
he' s dying .
i can give no absolution .
he was excommunicated last year in jerusalem .
good enough to build god' s house ... but not to let him enter his kingdom .
is that it ? .
william , go .
fetch the sin eater .
in jerusalem , my brother gave a dying arab a drink of water .
there was no well , so he gave him holy water .
my brother gave the church his youth in jerusalem ... his blood at st. peter' s , but when he lay dying ... they deserted him .
when his soul stretched out , caught between heaven and hell ... it was the other who delivered him .
it was the other who gave him peace .
i always loved my brother , alex ... but the church i grew to hate .
this ... is the other way .
this ... is the other way .
i can teach you ... if you are willing .
i was willing .
and so , i was taught .
did you kill dominic sousa ? .
the church killed him .
he died when he was excommunicated .
his body continued on a while , but his spirit was dead .
that' s a lie .
he was , alex .
he was ruined , broken , not playacting .
don' t talk to me of lies .
i lost it in 1 602 .
i had dinner with caravaggio and drank too much wine .
it' s a means an instrument for ridding the world of the other .
answer my question .
did you kill dominic ? .
he killed himself , alex , after the church abandoned him ... after they took away his reason to live .
they did to him as they did to my brother , alex .
and you know what i did ? .
you know what i did for dominic ? .
i gave him absolution .
i took on the burden of his sins , and i gave him peace .
not the church i.
so don' t talk to me of lies , alex .
dominic was like a father to me .
i' m just trying to understand .
come with me .
every fear hides a wish .
don t you think ? .
so what is it to be a sin eater ? .
what is it not to be one ? .
i know of no other way to be .
it seems beyond a man' s judgment .
forgiveness is god' s domain .
i' m just an instrument .
like any great power , it depends on how it' s used .
and how do you use it ? .
as i see fit .
i' m not a threat to the church .
i' m an insult , an embarrassment .
but you re a carolingian .
you know how it feels to be outside .
i serve the church .
serve yourself .
get alex some fresh clothes and a hot bath if he would like .
and then take him someplace quiet where he can sit .
if you would like anything , anything can be arranged .
how long have i been asleep for ? .
a few hours .
what is it you want , alex ? .
i want to learn the truth .
truth ? .
the terrible thing about searching for the truth is that sometimes you find it .
not to mention it makes you very unwelcome at parties .
it makes you unwelcome anywhere , even in church .
who are you ? .
i' m all that remains when everything else turns to dust .
but to put it simply , alex , i' m very , very tired .
are you a man ? .
i shit .
i fuck .
i shave .
does that make me a man ? .
can you die ? .
you tell me .
i laugh .
i cry .
once , i loved .
does that make me a man ? .
i don' t know .
what about you , alex ? .
are you a man ?
i' m a priest .
you understand the difference ... the truth of it .
good .
do you remember what keats said about the truth ? .
beauty is truth .
truth is beauty " '
keeping that in mind ... my original question , what is it you want ? .
the truth ... or something beautiful ?
something beautiful .
beauty is truth , alex .
does your oasis have a name ? .
mara .
her name is mara .
so say it .
say what you want , alex .
if it' s the truth , then why be afraid ? .
say it .
i want mara .
then you' re a man ... and not a priest .
and if mara s what you want , then you should go and get her .
shh .
you' il wake her .
she might be dreaming .
how we run from the things we need .
he' s dying .
that' s why i' m here .
rembrandt did some remarkable things .
this isn' t one of them .
it' s a de gelder .
but only i' il know that .
put it in the car .
your services don' t come cheap .
no , they don' t .
what did dominic give you ? .
i mean he , uh he had nothing .
that' s not true .
he gave me friendship once , and i returned it .
what do you think you can do for him that i haven' t ? .
i am the conductor of the night train .
the answer to your question is infinite .
science , medicine .
you give people nothing to hold ... except words they can' t pronounce .
cancers that act capriciously .
you measure life with a ruler ... and a bathroom scale .
you take away ... you kill the mystery that makes life mean something .
and you pretend to understand it all ... when you understand nothing , when you are nothing ... when your dust has more value than you do .
christ on the cross ... he gave forgiveness to a thief being crucified alongside him .
the church would not have allowed it .
but christ did .
i know this man .
that' s marcus burnham .
i read about him .
a lost sheep .
a man full of regret and fear .
such fear .
they say he got away with murder .
that remains to be seen .
blood in " '
blood out " '
from jerusalem my brother said it held a splinter from the true cross .
but the world is rotten with lies .
bread for the host .
and salt for the blood .
are you ready to make your confession ? .
uh huh .
forgiveness for the unforgivable .
breathtaking .
i forgive you .
i' m i' m free .
my cross .
alex , give me my cross , please .
so , what do you think of what i do ? .
it' s not immortality , alex .
you will grow weary .
but 500 years ? .
1, 000 ? .
imagine what you could accomplish given that time .
imagine the knowledge that waits .
what are you saying ? .
i' m used up .
my time is done .
but i believe in the legacy of it all .
i should not be the last of my kind .
there ... should be another other .
but why me ? .
in the end , alex , like recognizes like .
i' m not like you .
alex , you buried an excommunicated priest in consecrated ground ... after the church had forbidden it .
you went around their authority , alex ... the same as i do .
you' re exactly like me .
i hope you like sunflowers .
i love sunflowers .
you know that .
why ? .
why do you love sunflowers ? .
because i always thought that ... when god was making beautiful things ... he messed up with sunflowers .
how ? .
well , ' cause they look like i don' t know .
they look like crooked teeth around a mouth that' s too big , kind of .
yeah .
but ... just when he was about to start over ... he realized that' s what made them beautiful .
they were a brilliant mistake .
like you and me .
where did you go ? .
william eden ...
offered me the world last night .
when i saw these , i knew .
knew what ? .
that all i want is you .
tell me what it is .
it' s you and me .
it' s you and me till the wheels fall off .
yeah .
that' s right .
i hadn' t expected you so soon .
how are you feeling ? .
formal .
the pain has passed .
all that remains is the knowledge gained .
i brought you this , because i believe it' s yours .
and i have an answer for you .
haste .
that doesn' t bode well .
my answer to your offer is no .
i don' t want to be your successor .
was i that wrong about you ? .
we have a lot in common .
i' il give you that .
can i ask you a question ? .
of course .
go ahead .
yesterday you said you once loved .
were you ever married ? .
i' ve had many wives over the years .
but my love , that was centuries ago .
they grow old , and they die .
and i remain .
maybe you il understand , then .
mara i love her .
well , that' s fine .
have it all mara too .
there' s no need to choose .
you' re not a priest anymore .
don' t you see ? .
i
i don' t want mara to grow old without me .
alex , the greatest truth of all is that love cannot last .
you' il grow tired of it .
bored .
i' il still be here .
and so will my offer .
yeah .
good bye , william eden .
if i ve learned one thing , alex ... it' s that only in death do we ever really say good bye .
you want to know what i think ?
do i have a choice ? .
i think he' s evil .
i don' t think you should have given him the dagger .
and mostly , spaghetti , i don' t think he' s gonna take no for an answer .
it' s the only answer i' ve got .
dominic trained us for what ? .
i' m not a priest anymore , thomas  for what ? .
to dispatch ghosts , demons and all manner of undead .
that' s right .
you said so yourself eden' s a living man .
well , i was wrong .
and as soon as i can move , i go back underground ... see if chirac knows where we can find the rest of this .
it' s time to walk away .
let it go .

is it dark where you go , mara ?
is your pain shapeless ... or does it take form ? .
what are you doing here ? .
i came to see you .
i thought we should finally meet .
i' ve heard many confessions .
i never made one .
did you know alex' s mother killed herself ? .
has he ever told you that ?
how do you know about his mom ? .
i was there .
his father died in a car accident .
i was there then too .
like me , alex was defined ... by specific events in his youth .
in his case , they were too important to be left to fate .
you killed them ? .
and dominic helped me mold him .
dominic gave me alex .
that was his sin .
you still haven' t answered my question , mara .
is it dark where you go , mara ? .
when the nightingales sing ? .
hmm ? .
i brought them to you .
i placed you in alex' s path .
your love is my creation ... manufactured like an automobile .
you don' t need to worry .
alex will be fine .
i il see to it .
i' m sorry , girl ... but this world is too much with me .
i' il take you to a place where it isn' t dark anymore ... where the sun shines all the time .

we thought you would know , mr. alex .

everything that once was his is now yours .

what' s going on here ? .
barath mae , barath sec . '
jesus , mary , and joseph .
and watch your language .
it' s a set up .
now ...
kiss the ring ... and i' il spare your life .
blasphemer .
blasphemer .
so ... has the world gone mad ? .
no .
it still makes deals .
mine was with william eden .
i opened the vatican vaults and retrieved the dagger ...
william eden had lost 400 years ago .
in return , he compromised certain votes ... of certain cardinals .
for my deal with william eden ...
i will become pope .
a warrior pope .
a pope of a church that will reclaim its property ... and its sanctity and its power .
blasphemer !
aaah !
pagan worshipping blasphemer !
i need to speak with eden .
you know what i mean .
the other .
no .
i' m asking you .
i seek the other .
he ends where he began in st. peter' s .
we hang priests here !
the weak ones !
mara died .
slit her wrists .
i' ve got to go .
i' ve got to go .
alex .
am i the answer to your prayer ? .
you just might be .
i performed the ceremony ... found mara dying . found mara dying .
i did it to set her free .
how did it feel ? .
like i was god .
what about her sins ? .
do you have knowledge of them too ? .
yes .
there weren' t many .
hmm .
she was a good girl .
one thing about it troubles me , though .
don' t intellectualize something so visceral .
it' s just , in the church , suicide is a mortal sin ... and i didn' t feel it at all .
maybe the church is wrong .
no .
she was murdered .
one day , you will realize , alex ... that because of what i did ... in your heart , mara , your love ... will live forever .
no !
barath mae
barath sec .
now you' il know what i know , alex .
time to look into the abyss .
there are wonders there .
i feel like i' m ... 1 0 years old again .
i' m home .
i ... understand .
god save me , i understand .
the parchment it' s not how you kill the other .
it' s how you become the other .
i' m sorry .
i found out too late .
i won' t leave you like this , alex .
there has to be another way .
when i learn what it is , i' il find you ... even if it s to kill you .
morning .
i sent for the sin eater .
i am the sin eater .
huh .
so eden gets what he asks for ... and you and i are left behind .
what you told the vatican has ruined me .
did you know that ?
deposed ... and degraded .
it was you , wasn' t it ? .
i learned a lot in a very short time .
and in the end ... the only secret people keep is immortality .
you ready ? .
it' s the confession , not the priest ... that gives you absolution .
do you understand ? .
yes .
are you ready to make your confession ? .
yes .
she was like a sunflower .
god' s beautiful mistake .
choke on your own filth .
and now it is i.
i have been blessed and cursed ... for now i possess the keys to the kingdom of heaven .
i will forgive those who deserve freedom .
i will damn those who have damned themselves .
i will learn to live after love has died .
i am the sin eater .
