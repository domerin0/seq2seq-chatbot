atten hut !
here' s our man .
professor howard plummer .
he' s been kidnapped by a group of serbian rebels .
i know we' ve been up for 72 hours , but i expect perfection .
nothing else .
the enemy has a boat , four jet skis , and a chopper .
i' il take you guys in until we hit radar range .
then you' il dive from there .
once we hit our target ,
red one , red two , you take out our escorts .
i' il handle the chopper , and i' il find the professor .
red three , you radio in for our copter .
do you copy ?
sir , yes sir !
do you copy ?
sir , yes sir !
we are seals .
and this is what we do .
ah !
red two , handle the boat .
i' il take care of the bozos on the jet ski .
ah !
oh !
gotcha .
lieutenant shane wolfe , u. s. navy .
where is the briefcase ?
it' s right behind you .
man , am i glad to see you .
i never thought i' d see my family ...
i' il get you out .
we' re gonna do it my way .
no highway option .
yeah , i' m with you .
absolutely .
lieutenant , thank you so much for saving my life .
if i had died back there , my wife , she would' ve killed me .
just a joke .
do you mind if i call my wife to tell her i' m okay ?
i have strict orders to get you out of here safely .
we gotta keep moving .
lieutenant , i am safe .
please .
she thinks i' m dead .
all right , make it quick .
okay .
zoe , seth , lulu , peter , tyler .
it' s voice activated .
hey .
these are my kids .
you' d like ' em .
they' re really great .
i doubt it .
hurry up .
hey !
we' re almost ready .
give us another sec .
professor !
the doctor says you' ve healed up real good , shane .
i should' ve been out of here weeks ago .
look , i know heads are gonna roll for this .
hey , you took a bullet .
yeah , but i want you to know i take full responsibility for what happened to the professor .
plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had .
guided high altitude scrambling transmitter .
one pulse from a ghost satellite and a country can' t launch its own nukes .
that' s why the serbians kidnapped him .
they must have thought that ghost was in that briefcase .
ghost is still out there .
which is why i' m sending you back in .
i know you' ve never lost anybody before , shane .
i was with your father when he led a platoon ...
with all due respect ,
i' d appreciate it if we kept my father out of this .
all i' m saying is that it happens to the best of them .
and you' re the best .
i need someone i can trust on this
and i know i can trust you .
okay .
i' il put a team together .
no .
it' s not that kind of mission .
this is at the top of the pentagon' s priority list .
two days ago , i got a call from admiral blair .
it seems that the professor' s widow contacted him .
whoever killed her husband must think that ghost is still in that house .
now , maybe it is , maybe it isn' t .
a safety deposit box has been discovered in zurich in the plummers ' name .
i' ve been assigned to escort mrs.
plummer there to retrieve the contents .
we ' re hoping it' s the ghost program .
in the meantime , someone needs to watch over those kids .
that' s where you come in .
while there , you' il be looking for the hidden program as well .
ah !
you must be lieutenant wolfe !
admiral blair said you' d be coming .
come on in .
meet the rest of the gang .
come on .
kids !
get your butts down here and say hello !
okay , you' ve already met lulu .
this is zoe , seth and peter .
kids , this is lieutenant wolfe .
he' s gonna stay with you while i' m away .
hi .
hi .
oh !

ma' am .
baby .
that' s a pretty dress .
thank you .
i have date with butcher tonight .
i want to look nice .
ah !
you have a pleasant family .
well , for the younger ones ,
i think it hasn' t really sunk in yet .
it' s been hardest on zoe and seth .
but they don' t really like to talk about it .
well , it must be hard on all of you .
howard wasn' t around much .
his work took him all over the world .
he' d be gone six , seven months at a time .
yeah , i can understand that lifestyle .
anyway , about a week ago , someone broke into the house .
no one was home .
i didn' t tell the kids ' cause i didn' t wanna scare them .
mrs. plummer , i' ve dealt with ...
ow !
oh , my god !
i' m sorry .
that' s gary .

seriously , seth , if you drop me again , i' m going to kill you .
hi .
are you okay ?
i' m fine .
come on .
i' m not gonna quit !
i don' t expect you to understand ...
hey ...
i may not understand a whole hell of a lot about this kinda stuff , but i definitely understand not quitting .
and from what i see , you' re pretty good .
a little discipline , you could make a go of this .
but what about murney ?
he' s an all talk spaz .
so , the sound of music ?
i saw it when i was a kid .
really ?
the idea of a nun ditching her habit for a guy in the military .
nothing wrong with that .
do you think girls will think i' m weird ?
they probably already do , seth .
but you' il kill ' em later .
come here .
forget about everyone else for a second .
is performing what makes you happy ?
yeah , more than anything .
all right , fall in .
company .
center stage .
company !
center stage !
who is this guy ?
now , do you or do you not have what it takes to perform this musical ?
we don' t have a director .
i' ve directed rescue missions all around the world .
i' ve directed numerous snatch and grabs from countries whose names you are not allowed to know .
i' ve choreographed multi pronged amphibious landings and stealth air attacks !
do you think i have the military proficiency ... ... to direct this production ?
yes .
yes , what ?
yes , sir !
once upon a time , there was a family ...
once upon a time , there was a family ... ... of elves .
and one day the little elf family went into the magic forest to find a secret ... ... gnome ... ... facility , where the gnomes were turning mushrooms into uranium .
so three elves laid down heavy suppressive fire on the gnomes while the others maneuvered around to the right flank , finishing off anything left alive .
and not one of those elves were left behind that day .
we got ' em all .
even the teeniest ... ... littlest elf of all ... ... rodriguez .
you' re gonna have to do the panda dance or he won' t stop .
oh , come on ...
i don' t know how to do the panda dance .
i' il write it down for you .
close your eyes .
go to sleep .
i' il be right back .
you gotta do the dance .
like dad used to do .
he made it up for him .
you have to do the dance to make him sleep .
come on .
* when you' re down and low lower than the floor
* and you think that you ain' t got a chance , bum , bum
* don' t make a move till you' re in the groove
lulu .
thank you .
seth .
zoe .
uh !
today you drive .
but i can' t even pass driver' s ed .
exactly .
we' re all gonna die .
have you ever given a driving lesson before ?
in a minivan ?
no .

especially when zoe' s driving .
zoe plummer !
zoe , what are you doing ?
what are ... ?
slow down !
truck !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !

sorry .
hi .
hey , how are you ?
i have noticed an improvement in the plummer kids and i' m very impressed .
yeah , you know , they' re just misunderstood .
peter , careful !
don' t make me come up there !
someone needs to take the time to talk to ' em .
you' re getting a little attached .
i take my job very seriously .
but it' s like you said .
they' re just kids .
well , keep up the good work .
oh !
you look very nice today .
oh .
thanks .
i don' t think you understand .
don' t you ever do that again .
is that clear ?
okay , i' ve had it .
i caught the kid dancing to no music .
i want him out of my class .
somebody' s gotta give this punk a talking to .
seth ?
well , you got something to say , twinkle toes ?
yeah .
yeah , i do , murney .
i quit .
you quit .
you know why you quit ?
because you' re a quitter .
and everybody knows that quitters ... ... quit .
what are you scared of , prancer ?
i' m not scared .
i want to act .
and i want to take up origami .
i' m in the sound of music .
oh .
a musical .
you' re giving up wrestling to be in a musical .
that happens when there isn' t a man in the house .
there is a man in the house .
it' s me .
well , it' s gotta be a tiny house .
you think you' re tough , boy , don' t you ?
wanna shave the tiger ?
do you ?
huh ?
you want it tough ?
where did you wanna do this ?
what are you talking about ?
you said you wanted to wrestle .
where ?
when ?
after school .
okay .
today ?
that' s right .
the gym .
okay ?
remember .
you mess with the bull , you get the horns .
out of my way !
how did that feel ?
it was good .
murney is getting his butt kicked at 3 : 00 !
oh , that is so gross .
come on !
come on !
what ?
that' s it !
someone' s gonna get hurt today and you know who it is ?
you' re about to enter murney' s house of pain !
what do you say we go over the rules , cue ball ?
huh ?
oooh !
rule number one .
never be too eager to rush your opponent .
wanna play prison rules , frogman ?
wanna play prison rules ?
you got it .
i' il be your daddy .
ah !
all right .
now you' ve unlocked the beast .
oh , god !
from this position , it' s relatively easy
to manipulate your opponent .
ohhh !
and thus we have the chicken wing .
the arm bar .
the crow bar .
or my personal favorite ...
ahhhh ! ... the pacifier !
any questions ?
anything you didn' t understand ?
ah .
the nipple crippler .
this is a useless , not to mention , shameless move that ultimately is a sure sign of desperation .
and finally ...
pinned !
that was awesome !
are you okay , murney ?
get away from me !
can i get a little help , please ?
i can' t move my back .
watch the back !
go !
sorry !
i didn' t get that cone !
crawl !
see ?
but he usually breaks down the door .
excellent !
now do it backwards .
okay .
* when you' re down and low lower than the floor
* and you feel like you ain' t got a chance
* don' t make a move till you' re in the groove
* and do the peter panda dance
* just hop three times like a kangaroo
* side step twice just like the crabs do
* three steps forward one step back
* and quick like a turtle lie on your back
* roll like a log till you can' t roll no more
* better jump quick like there ain' t no floor
* hold your breath jump to the left
* and that' s the peter i swear that' s the peter
* that' s the peter panda dance *
again .
again ?
you' re going to sleep .
good night , peter panda .
good night , daddy .
good night , little fella .
good night .
hey , skeever , what do you put in a jar and shake till they' re dead ?
fireflies ?

customer service .
from now on , you do things our way !
no highway option !
ah !
* i don' t care what has been said fireflies rock full speed ahead
* give me guff , i' m in your face fireflies rule the human race
* sound off * one two , three four
* one two ... three four ! *
gary the duck ?
no .
we' ve been here two weeks .
this is a matter of national security .
well , i am sorry , sir , but none of these answers ring true .
howard .
i' m so stupid .
is it " my angel " ?
yes , it is indeed .
well , i' il leave you to your business .
please , howard , no more surprises .
zoe , a rookie sniper could drop you like a deer .
good .
good ?
all right , this is about scott again .
no , it' s not .
you were right about him .
stupid guy .
so , what' s wrong ?
nothing .
nothing .
okay .
you know , when i was little , my mom left .
my dad was a spec ops soldier like me .
when i was eight , he shipped me off to military school .
i guess he liked being a soldier more than he liked being a dad .
one day , i get a letter .
no more dad .
that' s terrible .
for a long time i thought if i talked about it , i was letting him down .
like i was supposed to be brave or something .
yeah .
it' s okay to talk about your dad , zoe .
i do miss him so much .
i don' t know , i just ...
i wanna be strong for lulu and tyler and peter and seth and my mom .
that' s such a big burden to carry .
i know .
i miss him so much .
it' s okay to miss your dad .
i' il get it .
really ?
yes .
really ?
yes .
seth !
seth !
guess what ?
mom' s coming home .

tomorrow !
she' s coming home tomorrow !

mommy' s coming .
here , buddy , mommy' s coming home !
mom' s coming home !
she is ?
she' s coming back .
peter , aren' t you excited ?
when' s she gonna be here ?
so , what are we gonna do ?
we should dress up nice .
we should make her something .
we' il clean up the entire house .
that' s a good idea .
we should make a banner too .
in the family room .
what' s wrong , gary ?
foot got stuck ?
hang on , hang on .
okay , now just stay still .
hi .
come on in .
are you ready ?
yeah , almost .
yes ?
hey , it' s shane .

it' s in a steel vault .
it needs some sort of two pronged key .
i' ve been working on it , but it' s tough .
great .
good work .
we' re on our way .
don' t do anything further .
i' il be there soon .

your mother' s coming .
you should be happy .
but , shane , doesn' t that mean you have to go ?
you should get ready .
your mother will be home soon .
i had a fight with zoe before i left , so they probably trashed the place .
welcome home , mom .
hi !
i missed you !
guy !
shane , i am so proud of you .
i truly am .
i am going to give you your choice of assignment .
anywhere you want to go , you just name it .
well , i appreciate that .
but i' il have to think about it .
you' re gonna think about it ?
well , the military' s all i' ve ever known .
i have no regrets .
i should hope not .
it' s just that being with this family ...
i' ve never had a ...

he' s gaining on us .
i' il handle it .
look , zoe !

i assume you heard the baloney bandit has struck again .
i accept total responsibility .
my intelligence , well , it was faulty .
if i had better resources ...
i told you not to pass her in driver' s ed .
you have exactly three seconds to get me through this mine field .
you have exactly three seconds to get me through this mine field .
one , two ...

and you' re not taking another parent away from those kids .
leave the family alone and i' il get you in .
you better not be bluffing .
zoe !
seth !
lulu !
peter !
tyler !
ah !
that was the code .
i saw mr. plummer use it to open the briefcase .
you think this is a game ?
code or no code , open it .
now .
you can' t make him do this .
i know howard .
you haven' t got a chance .
* when you' re down and low lower than the floor
* and you feel like you don' t have a chance
* don' t make a move till you' re in the groove
* and do the peter panda dance
* hop three times like a kangaroo
* side step twice just like the crabs do
* three steps forward one step back
quick like a turtle !
lie on your back !
* roll like a log till you can' t no more
* better jump quick like there ain' t no floor
* hold your breath step to the left
and that' s the peter panda dance .
