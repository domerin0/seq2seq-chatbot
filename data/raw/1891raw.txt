you have to close your eyes .
sit like this .
arms like this .
both of you .
draw a deep breath .
i knew it .
that' s what makes it so horrible .
you know something terrible is going to happen .
and then it does .

he' s lived a good life with our money .
when i get out , i' m going to visit him .
i have nothing , eddie .
eddie , i need you to come with me .
i can' t do it on my own .
you know the rules , kullmann .
you' il get over it .
it just takes time .
that' s just the way it is .
you' il get over it .
it' s been five years .
you need more time .
you can' t ask me now .
i just thought ...

reel it in .
i said reel it in .
i caught one !
a real fighter .
reel it in slowly .
slowly !
take the hook out and release it .
it' s too small .
what' s with your roof , eddie ?
it needs fixing .
i know a guy who sells roofing tile .
it' s going to rain into your bedroom .
you have to get that fixed .
i' m holding you .

i' m holding you .
come on .

don' t forget to breathe .
keep your head above water !
you' re swimming !

how is your back ?
stiff .
my dad had the same back problem , but he never made it out of bed .
you get used to it .
how is maria doing ?

this is prime topsoil .
poor things like this need all the help they can get .
guess i' il head home now ...
what' s this ?
roofing tile .
where did you get it ?
we ...
we talked about this earlier .
i didn' t ask you to get tiles .
no , but we did talk about it .
where did you get this ?
i told you .
my friend sells it .
are you accusing me of ...
do you think ...
do you think i have stolen it ?
no , that' s not it .
i just don' t know where you got it .
that' s all i' m saying .
do you think i stole it ?
have i said that ?
have i used those words ?
then what are you saying ?
i don' t know where you got this .
so you think i stole it .
that' s not what i' m saying !
what are you saying ?
that i don' t know !
you are wearing my shoes and jacket .
the shoes were in the hall ...
don' t you have your own clothes ?
i was wet .
i know .
these shoes were in the hall !

i got you some roofing tile .
you have a leak over the kitchen .
aren' t you leaving soon ?

aren' t you leaving ?
i won' t bother you anymore .
eddie ?
eddie !

it' s just a little scratch .
maria ?

let' s see .
you have to help .
one , two , three !
thank you .
can you walk ?

let' s go inside .
maria , do you have a needle and thread ?
i cut my self a little , trimming that spruce .
she' s too good for you .
you' il have to help me , eddie .
how long is he staying ?
i don' t know .
he can' t leave now .
he did it on purpose .
cut his leg ?
he knew what he was doing .
no .
i was watching him .
i knew he would cut himself .
you' re saying he did it on purpose ?
it looked like it .
that' s not the same as actually doing it .
he' il leave when he is ready .
it' s my dog .
you have a dog ?
i have a dog .
tito .
what' s he doing in your trunk ?
he' s dead .
aren' t you planning on burying him ?
sure , but i didn' t want to trouble you with that my first night .
i should have told you .
i' m sorry .
where did you get him ?
i didn' t know you had a dog .
you know nothing about me .
i know there' s a dog in your trunk !
i was going to bury him .
now .
today .
how did he die ?
i backed up over him .
you ran over him ?
i backed up over him .
he never used to sit behind the car .
it was a tragedy .
you can say that again .
i' il go bury him now .
you can visit the grave tomorrow .
i' ve seen you somewhere before .
i don' t think so .
have a seat .
what do you want ?
i' ve seen you before .
haven' t i ?
i wouldn' t know .
you were ... out of it .
you didn' t seem to care .
i am also out of it .
maria ?
are you eddie' s buddy ?
don' t want to talk ?
can' t you talk ?
eddie ...
i am also eddie' s buddy .
lnto the jungle .
i have used one of these many times .
mostly eddie , though ...
that' s what happens when people owe money .
you have to ...
you have to use it sometimes .
even if you don' t want to .
understand ?
they didn' t understand either .
until afterward .
then they understood very well .
very well .
you be careful with this .
can a barn just self ignite ?
i' ve been looking for bamse .
bamse ?
my dog .
he didn' t come home .
he usually comes home at night to sleep under his favorite chair .
you haven' t seen him , have you ?
no , i didn' t think so .
let me know if you do .
bamse !
dammit !
what color is your dog ?
brown .
stand up !
what color is he ?
brown .
brown ? ls your dog brown ?
ls he really brown ?
what' s with you ?
yes , he' s brown .
did you burn down the barn , too ?
i don' t know what to say , sven .
this is horrible .
he told me everything .
what ?
what' s done is done .
maybe we should leave .
bye , sven .
what did you tell sven ?
i told him we did it .
what ?
i said we ran over his dog .
i told him you backed up over his dog .
why did you tell him that ?
it was spur of the moment .
i couldn' t get my self to say that i did it , because he was so ...
he was sad .
so you told him that i killed his dog ?
it was hard for me to admit it , so i said it was you .
he' s my neighbor .
he does everything for me .
for me , kullmann !
here , where i live .
let' s go back .
we' il go back and tell him the truth .
kullmann had something else to tell you .
it wasn' t ...
eddie didn' t run over your dog .
i did .
i came around the corner , and there he was .
he' s a big dog , sven .
he jumped up on the car and started barking .
he was a good dog .
i think you should leave now .
i mean , what happened ...
you did hard time .
but you know the rules .
you took your punishment .
took it for both of us .
say no more , eddie .
i can' t play your game anymore .
i can' t .
i am going to leave , and y ou' il never have to see me again .

what' s the matter ?
what is it , eddie ?
i think it' s something i ate .
