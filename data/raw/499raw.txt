some call bregna the perfect society .
some call it the height of human civilization .
but others know better .
the goodchilds built bregna to ensure us a future .
they built the relical ... a memorial to remind us of what we' ve survived .
they built walls to protect us .
they tell us that outside , nature has retaken the world .
but the real problems lie within .
we are haunted by sorrows we cannot name .
people disappear ... and our government denies these crimes .
the goodchild regime provides for us , as long as we stay quiet .
so we trade freedom for a gilded cage .
but there are rebels who refuse to make that trade ... who fight to overthrow a government that silences us ... who fight in the name of the disappeared .
they call themselves the monicans .
i am one of them .
handler .
aeon .
we have an assignment .
we want you to sabotage goodchild' s central surveillance facility .
your entry will be noticed , but we will briefly disrupt their interior alarms .
surveillance is their greatest tool against us .
as long as monicans can be seen , we can be targeted .
we need you to blind them .
each mission brings us closer to defeating the goodchild regime .
this is my daughter .
have you seen her ?
she disappeared two months ago .
help me , please , miss .
have you seen this girl ?
she disappeared two months ago .

shopping for me , una ?
haven' t you heard ?
it' s a special occasion .
my sister' s finally coming to dinner .
claudius and i are looking forward to tonight .
for once , you' il be in the house long enough to sit down .
that' s why i wanted to meet with you here .
aeon .
i may not make it tonight , i' m sorry .
don' t be upset .
it' s not that you can' t come to dinner .
it' s why .
you know , i used to imagine you' d come with me .
we have different ways of solving problems .
yes .
you ignore them .
how could i possibly ignore them ?
excuse me .
this is my daughter .
i see the problems .
i feel them .
and i' m trying to make something good out of it .
a life .
what kind of life is it ?
there are good things here .
there' s one .
so i have a surprise for you .
tell me .
tonight .
so be careful .
and come back .

possible monican consort .
three subjects .
identification requested .
possible monican activity suspected .
it' s not that you can' t come to dinner .
it' s why .
you know , i used to imagine you' d come with me .
i think we have different ways of solving problems .
this is the way things are and i' m trying ... to make something good out of it .
a life .
you' re early , claudius .
but they' re everywhere .
we need to protect you from them .
this is how chairman goodchild deals with monicans .
but she wasn' t ...
she wasn' t a monican .
i had a family once .
i had a life .
now all i have is a mission .
una .
aeon .
aeon , una .
aeon .
come back .
yes .
she will see you now .
handler .
aeon .
we have an assignment .
one you' ve been waiting for .
goodchild .
we' ve intercepted information that will allow us to penetrate his security .
we want you to eliminate him .
you should' ve sent me in earlier .
that would' ve been suicide .
not for me .
patience , aeon .
it has taken a year to get the information we need .
i know you want to do this for una .
but you must remember , this is larger than you .
she' s not the only innocent person who' s been killed .
this is our moment .
we have never been stronger .
people are frightened , yes ... but if we show them the way ... they will rise behind us when he' s gone .
i' m ready .
tomorrow , goodchild will be preparing his address to the council .
to reach the government zone , you will need to cross the frontier garden .
once you are through the garden , you must move quickly to the citadel .
the underground interior has been built to be confusing .
we' ve implanted a route for you .
follow it .
i want sithandra with me for the crossing .
of course .
get to the forum .
that' s where chairman goodchild will be .
you know what to do from there .
yes .
do this and you will have your revenge .
and we will all have our victory .
hello , sithandra .
still can' t surprise you .
not yet .
how are the modifications ?
useful .
you should have it done .
i like my shoes .
warning .
end of civilian zone .
do not proceed .
warning .
do not proceed .
ready ?
always .
warning .
do not proceed .
sithandra .
let' s keep moving .
we understand these now ?
completely .
i' d keep off the grass .
rendezvous at 1620 .
i' il be waiting .
i agree with the policy of targeting proven monican threats .
but i' m afraid we' re going too far .
we can' t go too far with them .
there are advantages to showing a degree of leniency .
we can' t allow them the luxury of hope .
not even one of them .
brute force isn' t the only option .
it' s an effective one .
the monicans are growing strong .
soon , force won' t be enough .
so you want to compromise ?
negotiate ?
the policy should be reconsidered .
put to a vote .
the policy is not up for debate !
i' m debating it !
i' d encourage you to look at this with a little more detachment , giroux .
here , we must be impersonal .
you wouldn' t want me to take your outburst personally , would you ?
that is all .
oren ?
i' m getting worried about you , oren .
this edge you' ve taken .
displays like that aren' t helpful to us .
i believe in protecting what we' ve created .
i won' t apologize for that .
this was created to allow me to do my work .
i can' t do that if you can' t control yourself .
understood .
is it ?
yes .
and what about the test results ?
all negative .
sorry .
find me a new test group by morning .
maybe it' s time to give up on the tests , trevor .
we' re living the solution already .
this is perfection .
why can' t you just embrace it ?
you see what' s happening to people .
you know how desperate this has become .
it can be contained .
controlled .
i think you' re forgetting that this was all meant to be temporary .
we' ve always said that , but why should it be ?
because it' s wrong .
things change .
but i know you won' t .
you know me .
i' ve been your brother a long time .
you' re right about that .
trevor , your speech .
trevor ...
useless .
state destination .
forum .
proceed forward .
proceed left .
i know you have fears .
you have sorrows that shake your belief and try your patience .
but now more than ever , we must stand together ... because there are those among us ... who would tear down what we have built .
the monicans seek to divide us .
we must never forget who we are ... a lonely outpost , a tiny band .
we' re all that remains of a people that once covered the earth .
we must adapt together to these new challenges .
remember what we have faced , what we have survived .
we will adapt .
we have always adapted .
it' s the fabric of who we are .
katherine .
it' s you .
katherine .
wait outside .
aeon .
you called me by another name earlier .
i did , and you let me live .
give me my gun .
we' il try it again .
maybe later .
what was that name ?
you know me , don' t you ?
no .
do you know who you are ?
i know i came here to kill you .
that' s why you' re in a cell .
but we' re both still alive for a reason .
i don' t know what this is ... but it' s good to see you .
amateurs .
good boys .
aeon .
little busy , sithandra .
is it done ?
i need more time .
our information on him may be wrong .
i don' t understand this .
we have to move .
i hope you ...
don' t question me , sithandra .
i' il contact you soon .
aeon , you know there will be consequences to this .
i know what i' m doing .
this is outrageous .
one monican eluding all of our defenses ?
the problem will be taken care of .
the problem is trevor' s concept of security .
he needs to learn to accept more traditional ...
he needs to learn to accept our input .
another example of him pursuing his own agenda , no matter what we think .
i' m beginning to question his agenda .
meaning ?
the monican tries to kill him and he lets her live ?
an unusual choice .
and now she' s escaped .
does anyone believe this is a coincidence ?
do you really think that i' m a sympathetic ear ... for your complaints about trevor ?
you don' t have the right to question what he does .
you must be concerned , oren .
this is hardly routine .
i think i should talk with trevor .
and i think all of you should be more discreet .
inari ?
lmage retrieval commencing .
what happened ?
my sources were clear on this .
aeon flux is the best the monicans have .
she failed .
it' s the first time she has .
i wanted this done cleanly .
my brother ...
will be vulnerable .
preparing his speech ...
tomorrow , 1300 ...
it can' t be traced to you , in any case .
that' s comforting .
we did everything correctly .
she had her opportunity .
and she stopped .
why ?
i don' t know .
image retrieval underway .
it' il be too risky to call another hit .
the monicans may suspect they are being used .
stop .
oren ?
no .
that' s impossible .
claudius .
why are you still here ?
it' s not as simple as you think .
una is murdered and you keep working for the people who did it ?
what should i be thinking ?
you don' t know .
what don' t i know ?
they killed her .
and you' re still alive .
you killed her , aeon .
they thought she was a monican , that' s why she died .
una' s life was worth more than that .
she was all i had .
you' re not the only one .
what are you really doing here , claudius ?
working .
it' s all that' s left .
working .
for trevor goodchild .
i blamed him , too .
but now i don' t think it was trevor' s fault .
trevor' s trying to help .
something is wrong with us , aeon .
with everybody .
you have the dreams , don' t you ?
memories of things that never happened to you ?
una had them .
i have them .
it' s happening all across bregna .
what is it ?
i don' t know .
they only tell us what we need to know .
my work is a small part of a larger experiment .
whose experiment ?
trevor' s .
we' re studying what' s growing outside the wall .
something happened when they cured the industrial disease .
something else sprung up in its place .
we' re sick .
and trevor' s trying to cure us .
that' s all i know .
trevor tried to dope me .
tell me what' s in this .
it' s a message .
well , what does it say ?
you have to drink it .
that' s how it works .
i loved her .
you know that .
aeon .
i' m sorry for the pain , but it' s not safe to talk in the open .
nothing is as it seems .
you had your chance .
why did you hesitate ?
you know where to find me .
why am i here ?
i needed to see you again .
you killed my sister .
i didn' t know anything about it .
i' m sorry .
and that excuses you ?
no .
but this is a war .
people on all sides die .
she shouldn' t have .
she had nothing to do with this .
everyone is involved in this .
she wasn' t .
i don' t need that to kill you .
but it would be easier , wouldn' t it ?
everything changed when i saw you .
i know you .
and you know me .
why do i know you ?
why ?
why did you come back ?
what do you want from me ?
what do i want ?
i want my sister back .
i want to remember what it feels like to be a person .
aeon .
why do i feel this way around you ?
katherine ...
you know me .
i want you to eliminate him .
come back .
i' m not who you think i am , aeon .
something is missing here .
we identified the variables that compromised test group 7 a.
schedule a relical visit regarding 7b and make sure we isolate them .
it' s just a matter of time ... before people look up and question what' s happening here .
found you .
no permanent damage here , chairman .
you may leave .
she' s escaped .
why am i not surprised ?
i found her in the library .
i think i wounded her , but ...
you attacked her ?
she' s a monican agent who tried to kill you .
i assumed it was obvious what i should do .
freya , i want her alive .
do you understand ?
is oren aware of this ?
i can' t find him .
stay close .
no matter what trevor' s done for us in the past , he' s not above reproach .
this is treason .
oren ?
trevor has been moving away from us for a long time .
what we' ve built here is larger than him .
i never thought it would come to this , but we have to face the truth .
he chose that monican and he knew what that would mean .
he must be removed .
and oren is next in line .
isn' t that right ?
yes .
it' s done , then .
mr. chairman .
trevor has betrayed all of us .
he' s a criminal .
we' il treat him as one .
... test group 7 a.
schedule a relical visit regarding 7b and make sure we isolate them .
it' s just a matter of time ... before people look up and question what' s happening here .

you' re certainly killing him kindly .
the situation has changed .
our orders haven' t .
i' m not following orders anymore .
why are you doing this , aeon ?
everything has become more complicated .
no , it' s simple .
trevor may not be responsible for una' s death .
trevor ?
i' m trying to find out who is .
your mission was to kill goodchild and you can' t or won' t do that .
so ...
give me your weapon and return across the frontier .
didn' t i teach you to think for yourself ?
you taught me a lot more than that .
please !
i can hurt you if i have to .
don' t you feel something wrong inside you ?
sithandra , i' m ...
i don' t know who i am .
you feel it , too , don' t you ?
come with me .
we' il finish the mission together .
i can' t .
this sort of thing used to be fun .
now what do i do with you ?

aeon failed ?
she let him live .
there' s something between them .
something personal .
explain .
she abandoned the mission .
i tried to stop her , and she attacked me and left me here .
are you secure where you are ?
fairly .
help is coming .
aeon flux is now considered a fugitive .
she has betrayed the resistance and must be considered a threat .
she has aligned herself with goodchild and is with him now .
we must move quickly .
you will eliminate her .
kill her and then complete her mission .
sithandra , show them where you are .
do you see ?
yes .
yes .
yes .
extricate her and proceed from there .

what was she looking for ?
her sister .

una flux .
member of 7b .
killed in police action .
who did this ?
all actions authorized by adjunct chairman oren goodchild .
freya , go to my lab , find the notes from group 7b .
you need to get to a safe place .
they' re moving against you .
meet me there in two hours .
where are you going ?
i have to find her before they do .
trevor ...
freya , i' il see you at the lab .
take care of yourself .
una .
you' re right .
please don' t hurt my baby .
she' s safe .
you cloned her ?
i cloned everybody .
there was a complication when we cured the industrial disease .
the vaccine had an unintended side effect .
sterility .
only one more generation of our species could survive .
it was a desperate time .
it' s our responsibility ...
cloning had never been used on humans successfully .
but we succeeded .
now , when a person dies , their dna is recycled .
oren and i built the relical to store the dna ... and conceal the cloning process .
the keeper finds a suitable couple ... and , using food additives , we induce a chemical pregnancy .
when the woman comes in for an exam , we implant a cloned embryo .
from there , things happen naturally .
in nine months , a citizen who died is reborn .
for seven generations , oren and i have cloned ourselves ... taught ourselves , so that i could keep trying to find a cure ... while we all live on .
that' s what we are ?
copies ?
we' re more than that .
it wasn' t supposed to be permanent .
i' ve been trying to cure the infertility .
una was part of one of my test groups .
oren lied to me .
he told me her test had failed like the others .
but she had become pregnant .
he killed all of the subjects .
your sister included .
he killed her because she was pregnant .
una didn' t know it ... but her baby would' ve been one of the first new children in 400 years .
oren' s changed .
he doesn' t want to go back .
he doesn' t want a cure .
he wants to live forever .
you must' ve been expecting this after helping that monican .
your loyalty to trevor can' t protect you anymore .
i' m loyal to something deeper than any of this .
i don' t understand people like you and trevor .
your sentimentality , your devotion to the past ... to things that are gone .
i couldn' t live without those things .
how can you ?
sasha .
we should go .
it won' t take long for oren to find us .
she' s gonna be a handful .
go .
they don' t want you .
go !
down !
no .
you need to stay conscious .
please remain calm .
we are experiencing a technical malfunction .
please remain calm .
we are experiencing a technical malfunction .
please remain calm .
we are experiencing ...
we can' t go to a monican safe house .
nowhere' s going to be safe for us .
we need to get the bullets out .
are you hit anywhere else ?
did any of them manage to miss you ?
we might have to go outside the wall .
i know .
first , i have to end this .
i need to go back in .
i have to get my notes from una' s test group .
oren will find the lab and destroy it , everything i' ve done .
all military units should report to their stations ... and wait for further instructions .
who' s in charge here ?
we need your help .
we have orders to shoot you on sight .
there' s been a coup .
your orders are coming from an illegitimate government .
stay where you are , sir !
what' s your name ?
sir ?
i want to know your name .
it' s ord. garret ord.
i can' t command you anymore , garret .
but neither can they .
you' re free .
you need to make a decision .
shoot us or help us , but do it quickly .
lieutenant ?
how can i help you , chairman goodchild ?
we need weapons .
we need to get back into the citadel .
yes , sir .
attention .
please return to your home and wait for further instructions .
you will be updated frequently .
this is an announcement from the council and chairman oren goodchild .
attention .
please return to your home and wait for further instructions .
we' re getting closer .
wait .
trevor .
the name you called me ...
katherine .
that was my name .
you were my wife .
we had a life together , just like anybody else .
wait .
you need to tell me .
i lost you during the disease , and you couldn' t be brought back .
i' ve lived and died seven times since then .
and each time i taught myself about you .
you were an idea i kept alive .
something i had to imagine .
but when i saw you ... what i felt was real .
i knew you .
i remembered you .
what we had then survived in us past death , past everything .
i was looking for you .
i' ve been waiting .
we were different people .
we were .
those people are gone .
but something in them came back .
yes .
i remember .
it' s chaos out there .
there' s a coup against goodchild .
made it easier to slip in .
did you bring a way to find her ?
as long as there' s a trace of the pill in her , we can track her .
no .
freya .
it' s gone .
i had cured it .
i' d found the answer .
it' s all gone .
we have to keep moving .
there' s still one more thing to do .
there' s nothing left to do .
you and i need to get out of here .
we go outside the wall .
we' il find a way to live .
there' s one more thing to do .
i need to destroy it .
no .
this isn' t the answer , aeon .
there' s no guarantee i can find the cure again .
the cloning is all we have .
it' s not enough .
our minds are unraveling , and every time you bring us back it gets worse .
if you do this , we end .
we' re meant to die .
it' s what makes anything about us matter .
living like this is torture .
we' re just ghosts .
that' s not how i feel .
not now .
let' s be careful .
you know who we' re up against .
this is an empty gesture .
it' s a leap of faith .
it' s not for you to decide .
aeon , i don' t want to lose you again .
you don' t have to .
you' il find the cure again .
it' s over , trevor .
moving into position on the south spire .
it goes so much deeper than your cure .
other women have been getting pregnant naturally ... outside of your experiments .
more and more of them .
they healed themselves .
and you killed them , too ?
i had to stop it .
how many ?
how many , oren ?
it doesn' t matter .
nature' s finally found a way .
in position .
in position .
position acquired .
nature' s the one who' s obsolete , not us .
how can you not understand the beauty of what you made ?
i do .
situation' s getting complicated .
you told me she was gone .
there was nothing that they could do .
i ordered her dna destroyed .
you were a different man with her , trevor .
she would' ve stopped you from doing what needed to be done .
like she' s stopping you now .
no , oren .
yes .
waiting for the go .
on my signal .
this world , our world , is beautiful .
worth preserving at any cost .
it can' t last .
it' s falling apart .
sithandra , give us the signal .
sithandra .
take flux down first .
you' re wrong in this , oren .
we' ve beaten death , beaten nature .
we' ve gone beyond you .
and now i need to be free of you .
wait .
sithandra .
you chose this , aeon .
it' s too late .
you know how much we' re all suffering .
i' m trying to end it , and so is trevor .
i would never betray you .
help me .
sithandra .
you still know me .
finish it .
you can choose to trust me .
finish it .
i' m sorry , oren .
i' m sorry .
i am , too .
orders have changed .
cover aeon .
cover goodchild .
goodchild' s been hit .
flux is headed to the courtyard .
cover aeon .
sithandra !
oren .
they' re coming .
aeon .
we' re waiting for your orders .
you' re not part of this ?
whatever we are , we' re not anarchists .
there have to be rules .
thank you .
you' re the one .
you saved me .
yes .
i knew you then .
this one was corrupted .
destroy it .
i knew you were important .
the dna is good .
destroy it .
i knew that i needed to protect you .
i kept your dna hidden here , dormant .
i' ve waited until now to bring you back .
why ?
i knew that your strength would survive with you .
i thought that if i brought you back , you could reach trevor .
you always could .
i have to end it .
yes .
start over .
what about you ?
i' ve waited 400 years for this day .
i' m tired .
stay alive , aeon .
you are needed .
look !
now we can move forward ... to live once for real ... and then give way to people who might do it better .
hey , katherine .
will i see you again ?
to live only once ...
but with hope .
