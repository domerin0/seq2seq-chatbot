hello , matthew .
your brother must be very proud .
you' ve continued his legacy .
tormenting the innocent ... defiling all that is good and pure .
but now , you' re going down .
what' re you going to do , expel me , shermanator ?
i am a sophisticated counseling machine ... sent back in time to guide young and innocent minds .
my primary directive is to protect the students of this institution ... and all , indeed all mankind ... from the menace that is another stifler .
behavior modification is required .
it' s not too late to change your future .
no , expulsion would be too easy .
i know the perfect punishment to fit your crime .
since you have so much trouble with the band ... perhaps you should make friends with them .
no fucking way .
either you learn to be more considerate or you will be expelled .
no football .
no parties .
no spring break .
no graduation .
no college .
no coeds .
comprende ?
pack your bags , stifler .
you' re going to band camp .
band camp !
bullshit , trash .
all right , steve !
valley girls gone wild .

i mean , it was just a postcard ... but it gave me a great idea .
look ...
steve' s shit head friend , jim ... he married this freaking nympho band geek , michelle .
and he said all they do at band camp is screw 24/ 7 .
matt , buddy , you cannot screw band chicks .
there are standards .
i' m not talking about screwing them , scrotum breath .
i' m talking about videotaping them .
people love to see dorks doing that freaky shit on hidden video .
bandeez gone wild .
steve' s gonna have some competition now ... because little bro' s joining the family business .
yeah , spy chest .

we' re number one !
we' re number one !
okay , settle down .
now , as you know , each year ... one senior tall oaks composer is awarded ... a full scholarship to the prestigious robards conservatory .
elyse , this is your year to win .
this year , dr. susan choi , president of robards ... will judge the compositions herself .
and let' s not forget to welcome the tall oaks camp counselors .
if you visit our infirmary , nurse sanders will take care of your every need .
okay , so let' s work hard , and may the best band win .
you guys ready ?
what the fuck ?
are you a rookie ?
you look lost .
are you an asshole ?
you' re hairy , and you smell like shit .
i' il ignore that kind of talk once .
we don' t speak that way here .
rookies are to wear their beanies at all times .
those are the rules .
and who made you the mayor of geek town ?
i' m brandon vandecamp , senior drum major , beechwood academy ... and the president of the tall oaks council .
oh , and who are they , mr. president ?
the first lady and vice pussy ?
suits you well .
golly , jeepers , thanks .
hey , you know , since i' m an official band geek and all ... can you guess what my favorite piece of music is ?
i have no idea .
the nutcracker .
step back , bitch .
holy mother of mozart .
this is bad .
you didn' t know jackie chan was in the house , did you boys , huh ?
stop that .
stop that now .
those knob slobbers started it .
that' s not true , sir .
we simply reminded him to wear his beanie .
and then he viciously assaulted brandon' s genitals .
that' s a lie , you dick snot .
oscar , jimmy , escort this man to see ...
the macro .
the what ?
you' re dead .
now , gentlemen .
god , brandon , are you okay ?
you want to tell me what the hell you' re doing here , stifler ?
it don' t matter , big o.
he ain' t gonna be here long .
bitch !
get over here .
macro gonna fuck your ass up , fool .
what the fuck' s a macro ?
the macro .
morale and conflict resolution officer .
i heard this one time , this kid went into that office ... a baritone and came out a soprano .
clarinet up the ass backwards , yo .
what ?
pussies .
oh , i' m sorry .
frankenstein .
scary stuff .
i am just a boris karloff nut .
i' m the macro , mr. levenstein .
holy shit , you' re jim' s dad .
he screwed that redheaded nympho chick at my lake house .
oh , my , you' re not a stifler ?
yeah , i' m steve' s brother , matt .
there are two stiflers ?
yes , sir .
hey , what' re you doing here ?
oh , well , jim is now out of the house , married to michelle ... that redheaded nympho chick that you spoke of .
and , being a former tall oaks counselor of the year ... she was hired to be the macro this summer , but she got pregnant .
no doubt due to the tendencies you alluded to earlier .
and i have a great rapport with young people ... so i just stepped in and volunteered .
that cretin is not in our band , and we are not responsible for his actions .
who pissed in your piccolo ?
i' m sensing some hostility here .
he poisoned my band .
what ?
i' m the macro and it' s my job to deal with ...
what is he doing here ?
matt stifler is pure evil just like his brother . ... conflict .
thanks , leesy .
she seems nice .
there are rules , of course .
you will have to wear a beanie .
yeah .
oh , i know .
it' s a little silly , but it' s tradition here ... something you' re familiar with , being on the football team , i' m sure ... with your elephant walks and circle jerks and drinking butt beer .
but here , you just have to wear a silly little hat and ...
a somewhat stylish tall oaks t shirt .
yeah .
so , just go with the flow , matt ... and you will have loads of fun ... and you' il be making new friends in no time .
hey , ernie kaplowitz , tenor sax .
cool !
i' m a rookie here , too .
i really wanted to come last year , but computer camp conflicted , and ...
oh , yeah , that was here when i arrived .
i think it has your name on it .
what is it ?
hi , welcome to casa de stifler .
i' il be your host , matt .
every day here , i' il make it my sincere goal not to have to kick your ass .
allow me to show you to your new accommodations .
when i' m out here , you' re in there .
have a great day , fucko .
i don' t ...
okay ...
i' il just go and put this stuff away for you .

elyse , you think matt is an arrogant jock who wears his penis on his forehead ... just to gain the approval of his sociopathic brother .
and matt , you think elyse is an uptight , geeky prude ... who needs to loosen up and get laid .
excuse the expression , dear .
is that close to being on the money ?

i know what you' re doing .
you do ?
it' s what you always do .
you' re a fake .
you do whatever it takes to be the centre of attention .
just like when we were kids , around me , you were regular old matt ... but around steve and his friends , you were the stiffmeister .
who' re you going to be tonight ?
hey , cheese dick ... why don' t you quit being such a fucking taint licker , and get me another slushee .
fucking puss monkey .
you know what ?
i am going to have some fun .
fucking hoes , man .
i don' t get that shit .
i mean , right now , oscar' s off in the woods tapping that counselor biatch , sheree .
what' s up with that ?
that cock spring is getting laid ?
true that .
and here we are , the two dopest homeboys in camp ... and we ain' t got no prospects for our palm pilots .
that' s fucked up , dawg .
dude , i gotta see this .
use your hips more .
hips , like that ?
yeah , now faster .
yeah .
like that .
a circle .
like that .
crikey !
the alpha female has chosen an unlikely mate .
will he survive this dangerous encounter ... or will she satisfy her primal needs and then devour him for dinner ?
stay tuned .
i' m sorry .
i' m really no good at this stuff .
relax .
you' re doing fine .
this sucks .
how' s that feel ?
oscar .
is that your drumstick poking me ?
i don' t have my drumsticks .

oh , yeah , hips .
and step , and ...

j. c. , what , rocking the bunch

i just want to be respectful .
oh , that' s sweet .
the only person who' s gonna get laid around here .
hello , oboe .
this is so cool .
i hope i didn' t scare you with the rover and the soda .

maybe you should blow on it .
maybe you should blow on it and i' il pull .
hell , no .
jimmy ain' t putting his lips on that thing .
jimmy should be a team player .
try and relax , dawg .
not so hard .
oh , my god !
i was just trying to help him get it off , yo .
dude , shut up .
whatever .
he had an allergic reaction to the valve oil .
the swelling should go down in a few minutes .
these kinds of things would never happen with our old macro .
we didn' t have mtv when i was growing up .
so maybe it' s the over stimulated times ... that we live in that causes young men to stick their ... instruments in such odd places .
i knew a certain young man once ... who actually engaged in sexual congress with an apple pie .
and he turned out just fine .
so , you' re perfectly normal ... as these things go .
are you okay ?
oh , yeah .
i' m so drunk right now .
i' m probably going to forget about you ... porking an oboe .
i have six piercings .
that doesn' t include the ones on my face .
two right here ... and four down here .
haven' t seen that in a while .
yeah , well , no time for dance .
it' s all about band , band , band .
no , i was talking about you having fun .
i have fun .
i have fun all the time .
yeah .
i just get stressed out , you know .
i mean ... we graduate next year , and i don' t know .
i mean , i don' t really talk about it all that much ... because the cup is , like , a team thing , and ...
but winning the robards scholarship , i mean , that is like ... my future , you know ?
and ...
dr. choi is coming .
i mean ... you don' t understand .
she' s like famous ...
like holy shit famous .
and , sometimes , i just ...
i get really stressed out ... and i calm myself down by going off and playing on my picardo .
wait , you have ...
picardo ?
it' s just a cheapie , but i lost it .
wait , if i somehow found this picard thing ...
you found it ?
maybe .
give it back .
if you let me watch .
okay , but it takes me a while to warm up .
i have all the time in the world .
figures .
but i' m going to have to be really drunk .
i mean really drunk .
really drunk .
yes .
beat it , jerk off .
okay , people , let' s take a break .
we' re all a little sluggish today .
man , we suck .

ernie .
yeah .
ernie .
what you had before was way better than this .
this sounds like your overactive honor society brain .
instead of your nasty , wet ... dirty girl panties .
it should be more spontaneous .
stop .
maybe you should hang out with your friend matt a little bit more .
yeah , right .
i know he' s a dick and everything , but he' s also got one .
make some love music , you know ?
and then your notes will just cum to you .
oh , matt !

you would if you could .
oh , yeah .
okay , again .

they gave me so much shit for that .
i didn' t come out of my room for days .
you made it up to him by stealing all my underwear ... so you could run them up the flagpole .

stiffmeister productions ... in association with its talented new director , matthew stifler ... is happy to premier the unedited ... unfiltered , and un fucking believable bandeez gone wild .
oh , yeah .
oh , my god .
that is unbelievable .
you' re kidding me , right ?
that' s great .
danielle likes jimmy , but she' s like a foot taller than him .
and wait till you hear this .
sheree slept with that big oscar guy , the drummer .
said he was amazing .
i hooked up with brandon once .
some drummer .
he has ... no rhythm , and he can' t even bang very long .
oh , my god .

i' m not talking about the day he was born , either .
can you get my back ?
i think i got a little bit of sun today ?

and i don' t want to see you .
understand ?
did you help him ?
with east great falls in the lead ...
beechwood has to win the band camp playoffs .
direct yourselves to the marching field in one hour .
now , dr. choi , brandon vandecamp from beechwood ... is our best musician by far ... and his father , landon , is our best donor , also by far .
robards needs talented musicians as much as we need talented donors .
ipecac .
so how' s it going ?
are you having fun ?
it' s okay .
how about some ipecac , vande cooch ?
this herbal fucking extract will help you beechwood fief play in tune , huh ?

some day , you' il thank me , asshole .

damn .
that orange shit is janky .
i' m feeling grape , dawg .
i don' t care how many times they won .
they' re not getting the grape today .
that' s what i' m talking about .
your five time defending champion ...
beechwood academy .
they' re tight .
yeah , they' re better then ever this year .
okay , everybody .
it' s no surprise beechwood is good .
but this year is different .
this year , we can beat them .
we' ve worked hard , and we are good enough ... and this is our time , so lets win the cup .
yeah !
beechwood academy .
their music today was composed by senior drum major ...

i don' t know what happened .
not my shoes .
here we go .
stifler !
you know , you' re like your brother , steve .
and i don' t think those are the shoes you should be so eager to fill .
you know , the people steve thought were his friends ...
really didn' t like him very much .
what ?
but i think you' re different .
i think people want to like you , matt .
you just make it really hard .
parting is such sweet sorrow .
when you' re a loser .
mr. levenstein reports that there were a few incidents ... at camp .
but he also says that ... you bonded with the band briefly .
when school starts , you' re going to be on a very short leash .
remember , the shermanator sees it all .
be gone .
did everybody hate my brother ?
august 21 , 2005 .
some progress made with stiffy junior .
behavior modification evident .
will continue to monitor .
shermanator out .
a little " double d sheree " action .
little bit of dr. robot .
crazy fucker .
hey , stifler , where' s your instrument ?
dude , you' re in the wrong uniform .
screw them , dude .
they' re gonna freak out when they see the video .
look , we thought that if we had an advance screening ... then everyone would see that you' re not really a dork .
i can' t .
it' s gone .
what ?
the video , man , i deleted it .
why ?
guess little bro' s quitting the family business .
are you kidding me ?
he went fucking bandee on us .
hey , what' s up , guys ?
you a dead man , motherfucker .
you , too , little man .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
dude , the purple puke was an accident .
somebody switched the coolers .
hey , that orange shit is janky , yo .
chloe , we never saw elyse , you know , naked .
matt turned off the computer .
so we' re just supposed to forgive him now ?
he' s still an asshole .
you' re right .
i am an asshole .
i can' t take back spying on you ... and i can' t win that bandee cup thing .
but i can help someone get what she deserves .
i' m not asking you to forgive me .
just help me help elyse .
i got the number .
go ahead .
555 0171 .
he shouldn' t have been dumping ipecac in anyone' s cooler .
we could' ve won on our own .
i don' t even care that he saw me on camera .
well , i mean i do , but ...

i have a letter .
this letter is , well ...
it' s a fake .
this is not dr. choi' s signature .
what ?
stifler .
you son of a bitch .
what ?
it wasn' t enough for you to humiliate me at band camp ?
now you have to set me up here ?
what' s going on here ?
this is my band .
and that' s her music .
well ...
i' ve certainly seen some interesting attempts to gain admission ... but this is a first .
excellent audition , miss .
houston .
let' s go discuss that scholarship .
i thought brandon won .
no , mr. vandecamp was disqualified for plagiarism .
all right .
that' s what i' m talking about , yo .
oh , my god , you guys , that was amazing .
thank you so much .
thank him .
it was his idea .
word .
you planned all this ?
with some friends .
come here .
oh , i believe this is yours .
you know ...
picardo is a brand of piccolo .
you really are an asshole sometimes ...
stiffy .
man , change the channel , yo .
hook a brother up with some mad beats .
will you cut that out ?
your name is james hi ping chong .
your dad owns a chinese restaurant .
you live in the suburbs .
