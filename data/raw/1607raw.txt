my poor baby .
who has stolen the child' s dream ?
the mad genius krank in his evil scheme .
to what vicious depths will he not descend ?
will the tale turn to tragedy ... or have a happy end ?
step up , ladies and gentlemen !
step right up !
come closer .
don' t be afraid .
see the strongest man in the world .
look at those chains , made of the same steel ... as that used to lift
yes , my friends
the true light is invisible .
penetrate the corridor of shadows ... and you will enter the world of the chosen ones .
renounce the gift of sight .
i know there are skeptics among you ... afraid to share with us the dead of night .
be brave .
renounce your gift of sight .
pluck out your eyes .
come and join us .
help us build a better world .
the crusher bones is going to try once more to shatter steel ... only using the power of his mighty arms .
please , ladies and gentlemen , i want absolute silence ... during the demonstration .
i must beg of you , for your own safety ... not to look him in the eyes ... because his power of concentration is so great ... that he might provoke a cerebral hemorrhage ... in the weaker ones among you .
mr. one , ready ?
and now , attention !

you' re really too kind .
are you ready , children ?
not you .
you' ve got a cold .
one , two .
what is all this bellowing about ?
but , sweetheart , it' s irvin' s birthday .
irvin' s birthday ?
why , of course .
how could i have forgotten ?
let us celebrate .
let us all make merry .
everyone , let' s shout !
scream out !
krank , come back .
i had a thought last night .
if these children only have nightmares ... it' s perhaps because the evil is in you .
why not seek the cause of your torment ... in the molecular study of your own tears ?
who could make me cry ?
well , boss ... we could make you cry with laughter .
i am a gnome a bag of bones
a man of means and full of beans
the girls in spain sing my refrains
i' ve such a pain that it' s insane
you mustn' t be angry .
your brothers are doing their best .
my brothers ?
may i give it a try ?
go ahead , mollusk .
once upon a time , there was an inventor so gifted ... that he could create life .
truly remarkable man .
ah , a fairy tale .
i can already feel tears in my eyes .
since he had no wife or children ... he decided to make them in his laboratory .
he started with his wife and fashioned her ... into the most beautiful princess in the world .
alas , a wicked genetic fairy cast a spell on the inventor ... so much so that the princess was only knee high to a grasshopper .
he then cloned six children in his own image .
faithful , hardworking , they were so alike ... no one could tell them apart .
but fate tricked him again , giving them all sleeping sickness .
craving someone to talk to , he grew in a fish tank ... a poor migraine ridden brain .
and then , at last , he created his masterpiece ... more intelligent than the most intelligent man on earth .
but , alas , the inventor made a serious mistake .
while his creation was intelligent , he , too , had a defect .
he never , ever had a dream .
you can' t imagine how quickly he grew old ... because he was so unhappy .
boss .
there !
an eye dropper , quick !
an eye dropper !
then the poor masterpiece became so crazed ... that he believed a single teardrop could save him .
and , after committing many cruel deeds ... he died a horrible death ... never knowing what it is to dream .
get out !
all of you , get out !
good bye , uncle .
happy birthday .
see you tonight .
silence ... you glub !
what do you expect us to do with that ?
i wouldn' t waste a nail to hang it up .
but it' s pretty , isn' t it ?
don' t get smart with us .
the picklock won' t always be there to save your behind .
all right , get lost .
that' s all ?
afraid so .
if you keep being sassy
you' il be sorry .
there' s no shortage of orphans , miette .
listen carefully , tadpole .
you don' t want to go to the hole , do you ?
it' s very cold there .
and pitch black .
and full of spiders .
so give us all the rest .
the rest .
there' s a fine lad .
see ?
when you want to .
now , the second shift .
the neighborhood' s calm , isolated .
but be careful .
you never know .
there' s a backyard .
you' il go that way with all the stuff .
on the landing , there are three doors .
one is locked from inside .
that' s the one that must be forced .
behind is what interests us .
here' s the prize .
it' s identical to the one where he hides his loot .
the problem with this safe : it takes two hours to crack it .
two hours ?
we' re going to get caught .
we have no choice , unless you know someone capable of carrying it .
somebody got in .
you big idiot !
he' s right here now .
do i pay you to sleepwalk ?
who is this guy ?
don' t ask me .
i know who he is .
the strong man at the fair , the one who breaks his chains .
are you thinking what i' m thinking ?
nice going , mr. one .
one don' t like whistles .
one not thief .
a thief ?
who' s a thief ?
we' re not stealing , just borrowing .
what he said ?
he said you can take it back .
it just won' t be as heavy .
the true light .
little brother .
renounce the gift of sight and penetrate the corridor of shadows ... the world of the blind .
that guy is crazy .
the octopus will kill us .
tell her i' il bring him back .
i won' t be long .
help us build a befter world ... or we shall witness a reign of terror .
one !
where do you think you' re going ?
cyclops truck .
denree , little brother .
what about the truck ?
cyclops truck .
kidnap denree .
kidnap little brother .
you know something ?
you won' t find cyclops truck like that .
when you get there , someone will have eaten denree .
the wolf will have eaten him .
take a break .
no use wearing out your shoes .
i know where the truck' s going .
miette and one together ?
and then what ?
and anyway , how old was this brother of yours ?
little , little brother .
found him ... one night ... on his rubbish bin , crying .
one comes close .
discover
okay , i can guess the rest .
he' s just like i thought .
he' s too little to bother .
let' s go .
we have to get out of here .
stupid !
imbecile !
idiot !
have you finished ?
my crystal glasses are broken !
you' il crack my chandelier !
are you calmer now ?
one look for denree .
see you .
oh , come on , fat head .
where did those brats go ?
i don' t know .
it' s the big guy' s fault .
miette' s different since he came .
does he have all the jewels ?
that' s all he' s interested in ?
you had big ideas ?
poor little tadpole .
you haven' t fallen in love , too , like the others ?
get to bed !
filthy brats .
all the same .
we really can' t count on them .
raise crows , they' il rip out  your eyes .
it' s the best ones who want to go .
it' s not the first time it' s happened .
it' s always the same old story .
remember little lucas six years ago ?
and marcus before .
yes , marcus .
i' d almost forgotten him .
when we think  of everything we' ve done for them .
and if she had an accident ?
you never know .
at that moment , the winkles suddenly break into a dance ... then cast off their shells and begin to use them as megaphones ... to announce the concert .
winkles , winkles .
shells , shells .
and then , at that moment ... all the winkles cast off their shells ... and use them as megaphones to announce the concert .
the winkles ?
the winkles cast off their shells ?
please continue .
continue , and with colors as well .
yes , yes , yes .
then the hammerhead shark plays xylophone with the catfish bones .
the walrus plays the jew' s harp with the ... the sperm whale' s suspenders .
the sea is blue like the sky ... and the sky is blue like the south seas .
and i don' t know if i' m swimming in the sky or ... or flying at the bottom of the sea .
i swear it gives me the shivers .
shivers ?
shivers all over .
and igloos ?
oh , yes , tell me about the igloos .
igloos that turn into mushrooms .
ah , it' s you , my boy .
i was expecting you .
not so loud .
turn it down .
the boss might hear you .
the boss ?
he' s out of a test tube , like all of us .
lay the boy in the sarcophagus and come here .
but before
well , you promised me
what' s tormenting you , my son ?
well , this story that among us there' s an original clone ... different from the others .
is that true ?
of course it' s true .
the others are nothing but cheap copies ... while the original one is unique .
unique ?
yes .
and do you know who it is ?
do you really want to know ?
connect yourself to the child .
to the child ?
yes .
connect myself to the child ?
but i can' t .
it' s forbidden .
exactly .
the others wouldn' t dare , but you , you can do it ... because you' re the original .
me ?
i' m the original ?
but it' s not lonely being the original ?
all the penguins , the centipedes , everyone applauds .
except , even if you climb to the treetops ... it' s impossible to catch the candy floss .
and so , everybody climbs to the top of the mountain ... except the giraffes who , of course , stay in one spot ... munching the clouds .
sleep .
sleep , my little one .
i am the sandman ... and you can' t resist me .
your eyelids are so heavy .
sleep , my little one .
the snowflakes evaporate ... and then turn into haitstones .
in the farmyards ...
the turkeys scramble towards ...
the hailstones .
the better to peck them ?
and then when the children' s voices cry for help ... the chickens are merciless .
there .
now he' s going to come around very nicely .
who , the boss ?
no , the child .
he' s a real nightmare factory .
what' s that ?
a fuse blew !
perfect .
be careful .
someone will hear you .
it' s hard to be original .
now , throw this message uh , bottle into the sea .
yes .
go on !
may someone find my plea to get it over with .
i ...
gabriel marie ...
i came into this world with open eyes ... but i saw a world ... that was a world of dogs .
litter of dogs !
and so , the creator ... sent me down here to earth ... to recover the power ... that men have illegally seized .
my brothers ... you who have joined me in this struggle ... understand that together we must fight ... human beings ... from their own grounds .
the world ... of appearances .
t thought we had agreed on half a dozen .
but you know it' s becoming more and more difficult .
people are suspicious .
they' ve put up posters .
in any case , this batch is as fresh as they come .
not one of them is over five years old .
listen .
let us have maybe a couple of hours ... and we' il sort this thing out .
only the third eye ... will enable you to enter ... the world of appearances .
but beware ... because this sordid world of temptation and perversion ... is also the world of desire .
try , brother angel joseph ... to discover it ... without your losing sight ... of the only true light .
be strong .
my brothers ... our grace ... our great superior race ... shall reign once more ... on earth !
from that day on ... our faithful third eye ... will become useless ... as the world of appearances ... will be abolished .
it' s denree .
i see !
what' s that ?
that , brother angel joseph ... is a female .
a female .
do you have a problem ?
what' s that ?
that is a condemned man .
take them .
go on !
come back when those idiots have had enough .
search her !
what is it ?
kill her !
she' s clean .

you know all about feelings .
won' t you try to help me ?
won' t you explain why all those children only have nightmares ?
' cause you were their nightmare .
you can persecute all the children in the world ... but there' s one thing you' il never have .
what ?
a soul .
because you believe you have one ?
you don' t even have a body .
he who created us made us all monsters .
no , krank , you' re wrong .

he' s the only one responsible .

i don' t believe this .
what am i doing here ?
don' t worry .
everything will be all right .
if you say so , mister .
it' s funny .
i don' t even know the little brother .
but i know you .
the little brother could have been yours .
don' t be afraid .
just relax .
now , close your eyes , listen to my voice ... and sleep .
be brave , little girl .
who are you ?
why are you in my dream ?
why is it his dream ?
because he' s not afraid of me .
please let me take his place .
what would you get in exchange ?
a brother .
if i take his place , maybe i' il see his big brother again .
you are trying to trap me , aren' t you ?
you don' t risk very much .
