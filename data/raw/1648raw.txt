because you paid to kill yang
i didn' t
gene
hello , there are two suspicions
first , the chicken feathers found ... " have been analyzed and proved to ... come from the royal chicken which ... only the royal family can consume
second is a security issue
who can someone enter the palace ?
c. f. " can' t place the feathers
we can deduce it' s an insider' s job
but you can' t say it is me
to catch the real culprit
i' ve developed a quick blood test
thank you , papa
if you haven' t touched that kind of chicken feathers
your blood test will be negative
which means you are innocent
and vice versa
while you were drank the wine
i' ve tested your blood sample
and the results are ...
positive
positive ...
you are the person behind it !
the throne should be mine .
it' s unfair !
shut up !
guards , lock him up in jail first
i' m the real emperor , i am ...
nobody but me !
what are you doing ?
let go !
i am the emperor !
blindie , didn' t you lose your power
i don' t have any weak points
no weak points ?
to know you is my weak point
what are you looking at ?
can you see me ?
father , they ...
you can choose from the throne and the beauty
c. f. " , though your crimes are serious
but you' ve also did well this time
i have decided not to execute you
thank you , your majesty
but you must promise never to use your powers
your majesty , " c. f. " has died
he does not exist in this world
good .
about your eyes ...
the palace doctors will cure you
thank you , your majesty
phoenix , come forward
i am crowning you chivalry , white dragon jr .
