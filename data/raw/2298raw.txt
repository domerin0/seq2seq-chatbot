yeah , right .
let me speak to our mutual friend .
he wants to talk to you .
yes .
make sure he understands , then let him go .
do you understand ?
so say it .
i understand .
good .
jesus .
hola , que tal , amigo !
two milks as usual ?
hi .
why did you hide the cigarette ?
this building' s full of rats .
i don' t want my old man to find out .
got enough problems ...
what happened ?
i fell off my bike .
hey .
don' t tell my dad about the cigarette , ok ?
i mean , what' s my job ?
i' m just a holder .
i hold the stuff just like you give it to me .
i don' t look at it .
i don' t touch it , i don' t even know how to cut it .
try and follow me , all right ?
in june when we gave you the dope , it tests a 100 % pure .
now it' s july .
we pick up the dope and it tests 90 % pure .
now , somewhere between june and july 10 % turned to cut .
i don' t know , that' s none of my business , i' m just a holder .
you give me the stuff , i hold the stuff , that' s all i know !
hey look , you know , i' m trying to help you out here .
but , you know , if you' re gonna be a hard ass about it ,
i gotta disturb him .
now let me tell ya : when he' s into his music , he hates being disturbed .
i' m telling you the truth !
i hope so .
because he' s got a talent for sniffing out a lie ...
it' s scary , it' s almost like a sixth sense .
now , are you gonna change your tune or do i gotta bust into his ?
i' m telling you the truth .
all right ...
stan ,
stan ,
i' m , i' m sorry , you see , he says he didn' t cut the dope .
oh .
of course , he didn' t .
just do me a favor .
find out who did .
for tomorrow .
noon .
malky , hey , wait !
hey , i didn' t cut your shit !
find out yourself !
what the hell are you doing out here ?
get inside and do your homework .
i did it already .
oh yeah ?
well , you can get inside and help your sister clean up the goddamn house !
and stop smoking cigarettes !
time' s up , my turn now .
change the channel and i' il smash your face !
sorry , sweetheart .
good morning , sleepy .
hi , honey .
hey , you two .
sweetheart , turn that down , mom has got a headache .
she took my turn !
she just wants to watch these goddamn cartoons !
it wouldn' t hurt her to move her ass a bit .
i' m not the one with the fat ass around here !
can someone who is doing nothing all day but watching cartoons move her little ass and go get some food ?
i dare you to say that again !
margie , i think i screwed up .
it wouldn' t be the first time ,
i mean you always come up with something , right ?
yeah , but i think i went a little too far this time .
i think you' re going a little too far right now .
i' m gonna be late for work .
how about working at home today ?
she' s gonna hit me !
daddy .
shit , shut the goddamn door !
fucking bitch !
hey , can somebody answer the phone ?
i' m busy !
hello ?
this is margaret mcallister , headmistress at the spencer school in wildwood , new jersey .
is mr. or mrs. lando home ?
yes , this is she .
mrs. lando , when your husband enrolled mathilda at spencer , he told us she had ... problems .
well , as you know , we pride ourselves in turning troubled girls into healthy , productive young women .
but if they are not here , there is very little we can do .
now , mathilda left school without permission nearly two weeks ago .
i know your husband paid tuition in advance for a year .
but if you will refer to page 20 in the rules and regulations manual we sent you , you wili see that unless there is a valid excuse for prolonged absence , your tuition will be forfeit .
she' s dead .
is life always this hard , or is it just when you' re a kid ?
always like this .
keep it .
hey , i' m going grocery shopping .
you want some milk ?
one quart of two ?
it' s two , right ?
i like these calm little moments before the storm .
it reminds me of beethoven .
can you hear it ?
it' s like , when you put your head to the grass .
you can hear it growing .
you can hear the insects , bzzzz ...
do you like beethoven ?
couldn' t really say .
i' m gonna play you some .
daddy !
benny , stay here !
daddy !
daddy !
jesus !
fuck !
we said noon !
i' ve got one minute past .
you don' t like beethoven .
you don' t know what you' re missing .
overtures like that get my juices flowing .
so powerful !
but after his openings , to be honest , he does tend to get a little fucking boring ...
that' s why i stopped !
toss the apartment .
you' re a mozart fan .
i love him , too .
i lo o ove mozart !
he was austrian , you know .
but for this kind of work , he' s a little bit light .
so i tend to go for the heavier guys .
cool .
what the fuck are you doing , huh ?
man , keep your bombacut mouth shut .
check out brahms , he' s good too .
what the fuck do you know about music ?
yeah , knock it off !
checked the mattress ?
nope .
fuck !
stan !
look what you did !
stan , are you all right ?
look what you dld !
hey , stan .
stan !
what' re you doing ?
what' re you doing , he' s dead !
but he ruined my suit .
i know .
i know , but he' s dead .
he' s a piece of meat , forget about it .
calm down .
i' m calm .
stay there , ok ?
benny !
benny !
jesus fucking christ , benny !
it' s malky and stan !
take it easy , all right ?
come on , come on .
benny !
come on .
let' s get a cigarette , all right ?
benny , we' re coming out !
benny , don' t fire !
get in !
jesus fucking christ , benny !

take it easy !
what' s happening out there ?
it' s all right , ma' am , go in .
dea .
police .
why don' t you leave that poor family alone ?
everything' s all right .
just calm down .
i' m calm .
i' m calm .
why don' t you leave ' em alone ?
go back inside !
stan , i think it' s better if we go inside , all right ?
benny , turn that kitchen upside down , find that shit !
willy blood , look what you did !
you killed the four year old kid !
did you really have to do that ?
please , open the door .
please .
please .
benny , there' s three kids here .
i think stan killed this girl , and willy , that asshole , shot the little boy .
the third one' s missing .
find her .
oh , shit .
hey , we missed the little girl , man .
i' m gonna try and find the fucking super of this goddamn building .
yo , i found it !
bingo !
stan , we found it .
i know ...
here it is .
there' s cops outside , we better go .
it' s the cops outside .
we better go .
you stay here .
what do you want me to tell them ?
tell them we were doing our job .
what' s your name ?
mathilda .
sorry about your father .
if somebody didn' t do it one day or another ,
i would' ve probably done it myself .
your mother , she ...
she' s not my mother .
and my sister , she wanted to lose some weight , anyway .
but she never looked better .
not even my real sister .
just a half sister , and not a good half at that .
if you couldn' t stand them , why are you crying ?
because they killed my brother ...
what the hell did he do ?
he was four years old .
he never used to cry .
just used to sit next to me and cuddle ...
i was more of a mother to him than that goddamn pig ever was !
hey , don' t talk like that about pigs !
they' re usually much nicer than people .
but they smell like shit .
not true !
as a matter of fact , right now i have one in my kitchen that' s very clean and smells very nice .
you don' t have a pig in your kitchen !
yes , i do .
i was just in there and i didn' t see any goddamn pig !
don' t move , i' il get him .
piggy ?
piggy ?
where are you ?
ah , there you are !
hi mathilda .
hi piggy .
how are you today ?
i' ve seen better days .
what' s your name ?
lon .
cute name .
you have anyone you can go to ?
any family , any place else ?
i' m gonna get some more milk .
holy shit !
don' t touch that , please .
lon ?
what exactly do you do for a living ?
cleaner .
you mean you' re a hitman ?
yeah .
cool .
do you clean anyone ?
no women , no kids , that' s the rules .
how much would it cost to hire someone to get those dirtbags who killed my brother ?
five grand a head .
wow .
i work for you and in exchange you teach me how to clean .
what do you think ?
i' il clean your place , i' il do the shopping ,
i' il even wash your clothes .
is it a deal ?
no .
it' s not a deal .
what do you want me to do ?
i' ve got no place to go !
you' ve had a rough day today .
go to sleep and we' li see tomorrow , ok ?
you' ve been really great with me , lon .
and it' s not always like that , you know ?
good night .
sleep well ?
good , because after breakfast you gotta take off .
where to ?
not my problem .
read it !
you don' t know how to read .
i' m learning , but i had a lot of work lately , so
i' m a little behind .
what' s it say ?
i' ve decided what to do with my life
i wanna be a cleaner " .
you wanna be a cleaner .
here .
take it .
it' s a goodbye gift .
go clean .
but not with me .
i work alone .
understand .
alone ?
bonnie and clyde didn' t work alone .
thelma and louise didn' t work alone .
and they were the best .
mathilda , why are you doing this to me ?
i' ve been nothing but nice to you !
i even saved your life yesterday , right outside the door .
right , so now you' re responsible for it .
if you saved my life , you must have saved it for a good reason .
if you threw me out now it' s like you never opened your door .
like you let me die right there in front of it .
but you did open it , so ...
mathilda ...
if you don' t help me , i' il die tonight .
i can feel it .
but i don' t want to die tonight .
mathilda , you' re just a little girl , so , don' t take it badly , but ...
i don' t think you could do it .
i' m sorry .
how' s that ?
mathilda , don' t you ever do that again or i' il break your head .
you got that ?
ok .
i don' t work like that .
it' s not professional .
there is rules !
ok .
and stop saying " ok " all the time !
ok ?
ok .
good .
hi !
you expect to use that in this hotel ?
mister .
i have to use it because
i have an audition at julliard next month and i have to practice .
ok , but not after ten , hm ?
ok , i promise .
i' m gonna put you at the end of the hall so that you don' t disturb anyone .
could you fill those out please ?
daddy , can i please fill them out , you know how i like to check in to hotels !
thanks , pap !
i' il bring these back in a minute .
fourth floor .
thanks mister !
you' re lucky to have a little girl that' s interested in things !
i have a kid , seventeen , does nothing all day long .
can i leave my plant here while i take my stuff upstairs ?
of course .
i' m putting the name of a girl in my class who makes me sick .
when things get hot , she' il take the heat .
there , finished .
how old are you ?
eighteen .
eighteen ?
wanna see my license ?
no .
you just look a little ... younger .
thanks .
lon , i want you to teach me how to be like you .
i wanna be strong like you , smart like you .
mathilda .
i know i' m not strong enough yet , but i could learn the basics , the theory .
what do you think ?
just the theory .
i need this , lon .
i need time to get my head together .
yeah .
and i need ...
a drink .
don' t move !
i' il go get you one .
salute .
you know , when you told me to get this baby out for you ,
i thought my hearing' s going .
i says to myself , " lon' s a pro .
nobody uses that , except beginners " .
i like to stay in shape .
sure .
always stay on top .
it' s like me .
i gotta know where everything is all the time .
that' s why i don' t leave this place except to go from here to there .
change ain' t good , lon .
you know ?
yeah .
check it .
make sure it' s the right thing .
i trust you .
one thing' s got nothing to do with the other .
remember that , lon .
i will .
the rifle is the first weapon you learn how to use , because it lets you keep your distance from the client .
the closer you get to being a pro , the closer you can get to the client .
the knife , for example , is the last thing you learn .
ok ?
ok .
position .
no .
never take it off until the last minute , it reflects light .
they can see you coming from a mile away .
and always dress down , never brighter than the floor .
ok ?
ok .
let' s practice now .
it' s the best way to learn .
who should i hit ?
whoever ...
i' il be with you in a second , all right , give me a few minutes .
thank you .
thanks a lot .
you guys in the suits get lost .
i don' t want to see you , all right ?
it has to look natural .
no women , no kids , right ?
right .
the jogger in the yellow and orange ?
ok .
keep calm .
don' t take your eyes off him .
breathe easy , watch his movement .
pretend you' re running with him .
try to feel his next movement .
take a deep breath , hold it ...
now .
i' m all right .
i' m fine .
i' m fine .
get down .
one shot !
not bad , huh ?
can we try with real bullets now ?
not today ...
let' s pack up .
here , continue like that .
here , after ...
no thanks .
no discussion .
it seemed ... to socrates ...
to so cra tes ...
i' il do it .
lon , all we do is work .
we need a break .
let' s play a game .
what kind of game ?
i have this great game .
it makes you think and it helps your memory .
it' s exactly what you need .
ok .
ok .
who is it ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
mustache ...
no .
gene kelly ?
good .
your turn now .
ok , pilgrim ...
clint eastwood ?
i don' t know , i give up .
john wayne .
i was just about to say that .
i swear .
it' s amazing , lon , really , brilliant .
amazing .
you love your plant , don' t you ?
it' s my best friend .
always happy .
no questions .
and it' s like me , you see ?
no roots .
if you really love it , you should plant it in the middle of a park so that it can have roots ...
i' m the one you should be watering if you want me to grow .
you' re right .
no .
yes .
no .
yes .
yes !
they gotta be jumping out of the plate , they gotta be alive .
it' s been a longtime , lon .
i missed you and you missed some nice jobs , too .
i been training .
training' s good .
but don' t overdo it , huh ?
you know training don' t pay as good as working , lon .
tony , all the money i make ... that you keep for me .
you need some money ?
no .
just curious .
because i' ve been working a longtime and haven' t done anything with my money ,
i thought maybe some day i could ... use it .
you met a woman ?
lon , you gotta be careful with women .
remember when you arrived in this country , lon ?
when i took you in , you were still wet behind the fucking ears , and already you were in deep shit because of a woman ...
don' t forget that , lon .
wish i could , sometimes .
you know , about my money .
maybe i , maybe i could give ... little ...
to someone .
you know , to help out .
hey , it' s your money , i mean , i' m just holding it for you , you know .
like a bank .
except that , you know , better than a bank because , you know , banks are always knocked off .
and no one knocks off old tony .
and besides , in a bank there' s always tons of forms to be filled and all that shit .
but old tony , nothing to read , nothing to write it' s all in his head .
i know how to read now .
that' s good , lon , good .
your money is here whenever you want it , you just ask me , ok ?
here' s a grand .
no , it' s ok .
i don' t need it .
no .
come on , come on , take it .
have some fun .
go ahead .
take it .
thank you .
all right , now let' s talk business .
don' t move , i' il go get the file .
manolo , a glass of milk for my friend lon here !
listen mathilda , you gotta be careful .
you can' t just speak to any guy off the street .
lon , get a grip .
what' s the big fucking deal ?
i was just smoking a butt while i was waiting .
i want you to stop cursing .
you can' t talk to people like that all the time .
i want you to make an effort to talk nice .
ok .
and i want you to stop smoking .
ok .
stay away from him , he looks like a weirdo .
ok .
i' il be out in five minutes , stand where i can see you .
ok .
lon , i think i' m kind of falling in love with you .
it' s the first time for me , you know ?
how do you know it' s love if you' ve never been in love before ?
cause i feel it .
where ?
in my stomach ...
it' s all warm .
i always had a knot there ... and now it' s gone .
mathilda , i' m glad you don' t have a stomach ache anymore ,
i don' t think that means anything ...
i' m late for work .
i hate being late for work !
hey , how' s the practicing going ?
how are we today , miss ?
i' m sick of practicing .
i understand .
but you' re doing all right .
i haven' t received any complaints at all .
well , i put a cloth over the strings to lessen the noise .
oh ?
oh , that' s very smart !
not everyone loves music .
yeah i know .
what exactly does your father do ?
well , he' s a composer .
ah !
that' s wonderful !
except he' s not really my father .
he' s my lover .
i' m gonna go for a walk .
what' re you doing saturday ?
what about dinner ?
hey , where you going ?
visiting friends at 6j .
ok right .
we know you' re a busy man and we' il try to make this as short as possible .
now if you just take us step by step through exactly what happened .
the guy was here , he went for his gun .
bang !
we shot him .
where exactly were the kids ?
i don' t know .
they should have been at school , don' t you think ?
but in the statement you said you were the first man in , didn' t you see any kids ?
the door was broken , what happened ?
did you follow the procedure ?
i lost a good man here .
what the fuck do you want with me ?
cooperation .
i haven' t got time for this mickey mouse bullshit .
you want cooperation ?
come up my office , will you ?
4602 .
kids should be at school .
hey .
hey , come on , that' s my ball !
hey , give that back !
come on , where you going ?
damn , where are you going , man ?
that' s my ball !
follow the blue car !
and i suppose you mean to blast the music and go through lights , eh ?
no .
drive slowly .
take the hundred bucks , and shut the fuck up , ok ?
it' s for you , a present .
do you want me to open it ?
i' il open it !
how do you like it ?
nice , eh ?
mr. mcguffin ?
can i have a word with you ?
here !
this is for a contract .
twenty grand , right ?
his name is norman stansfield and he' s in room 4602 in the dea building , 26 federal plaza .
i' m not taking it .
why not ?
too heavy .
well , would you rent me your gear for the day ?
i never lend out my gear .
but you stili have your gun .
use it .
just do me a favor , don' t shoot out the window , ok ?
why are you so mean to me ?
you' re out there killing people you don' t give a shit about , but you won' t get the bastards who killed my whole family .
revenge is not good , mathilda .
believe , it' s better to forget .
to forget ?
after i' ve seen the outline of my brother' s body on the floor , you expect me to forget ?
i want to kill those sons of bitches , and i' il blow their fucking heads off !
nothing' s the same after you' ve killed someone .
your life is changed forever .
you' li have to sleep with one eye open for the rest of your life .
i don' t give a shit about sleeping , lon !
i want love ... or death .
that' s it .
love or death .
get off my case , mathilda .
i' m tired of your games .
it' s really great game , lon .
it makes people nicer and starts them thinking .
the kind of game you love .
if i win , you keep me with you .
for life .
and if you lose ?
you' il go shopping alone .
like before .
you' re gonna lose , mathilda .
there' s a round in the chamber , i heard it .
so what ?
what' s it to you if i end up with a bullet in the head , huh ?
nothing .
i hope you' re not lying , lon .
i really hope that down deep inside there' s no love in you .
cause if there is , just a little bit of love in you
i think that in a few minutes you' re gonna regret you never said anything .
i love you , lon .
i win .
i took a hit , i need a hand now .
i know she' s young but ... she learns fast .
kids need to be shaped into something right ?
yeah .
i know i taught you that .
but ain' t there an age limit ?
she' s eighteen .
oh , really ?
how about something to drink , tony ?
yeah , sure , manolo .

there , right there , you see ?
the first shot takes him out of order and the second finishes him off .
never in the face .
if they can' t recognize the client , you don' t get paid , cause you could take out anybody and say you did the job .
got it ?
got it .
never in the face .
ok .
now you can put the tools away .
what the fuck is going on ?
hey , mister .
you see , when you use the silencer a lot . you have to put a piece of cloth here , because it gets very hot and could burn it inside .
a damp , black cloth is the best .
what are you doing ?
we said no women , no kids .
who do you think this is gonna kill ?
donkeys and monkeys ?
now .
it' s clean .
let' s get outta here .
i thought we don' t have the right to drink ?
i know , but we' re making an exception for your first client .

like in the movies .
no .
yes .

i' m gonna kiss you .
mathilda , stop please .

i' d like you to give her ...
my money .
you can count on me , lon .
thank you , tony .
yeah .
i won' t be long .
did i do something wrong ?
no , this one is too big .
yeah , and i only get the leftovers , is that it ?
mathilda , since i met you , everything' s been different .
so , i just need some time alone .
and you need some time to grow up a little .
i' ve finished growing up , lon .
i just get older .
and for me , it' s the opposite .
i' m old enough ,
i need time to grow up .
shit .
you' re new , aren' t you ?
fifth floor right ?
well you can' t sit here like that .
really ?
why not ?
nothing' s free .
like a parking meter .
when you stop , you pay .
it' s the law .
only on tv ...
what did you say ?
forget it , how much is your meter ?
ten dollars ... a month .
got change ?
don' t worry about it , we' il do ten for twelve .
i' il pay enough for the rest of the year , ok ?
ok , a year .
does paying rent here mean i have to put up with you guys ?
uh ... no .
so go play somewhere else .
i need to think .
stand up , don' t you like your job ?
food .
where are you going ?
special delivery .
room 4602 .
sign here .
have a nice weekend , girls .
special delivery , huh ?
let me guess ...
chinese ?
thai , maybe ?
i' ve got it .
italian food .
what' s your name , angel ?
mathilda .
mathilda .
mathilda ,
i want you to put the sack on the floor .
good .
and now i want you to tell me everything you know about italian food .
and don' t forget the name of the chef who fixed for me !
nobody sent me .
i do business for myself .
so this is something personal , is it ?
what filthy piece of shit did i do now ?
you killed my brother .
i' m sorry .
and you wanna join him ?
no .
it' s always the same thing .
it' s when you start to become really afraid of death , that you learn to appreciate life .
do you like life , sweetheart ?
yes .
that' s good .
because i take no pleasure in taking life ... if it' s from a person who doesn' t care about it .
stan !
stan .
shit , stan .
i' ve been looking all over for you , man .
i' ve checked upstairs , and ...
what ?
i' m busy .
it' s malky , man .
he' s dead .
malky was making a buy for us from the chinamen .
yeah , but they got nothing to do with it , man .
they told me , this guy came from the outside .
he was a pro , he was fast .
he fucking came outta nowhere .
boom .
shoots the chinamen dead in two seconds .
easy man , i' m a cop .
then turns around , says something to malky like ...
no women , no kids .
i think it was something personal .
death is ... whimsical today .
blood , you hear me ?
yeah man , i hear you stan , just chill out man .
would you take her up to my office ?
all right , yeah .
jesus fucking christ !
lon , my love .
i know where to find the guys who killed my brother .
their boss is norman stansfield and he is in the dea building , room 4602 .
i' m gonna do that myself .
if something goes wrong ,
i left you twenty grand on the table .
it' s for a contract .
five grand a head , right ?
i know i' il feel better after i do this .
i love you mathilda .
wait for me .
i won' t be long .
look , i can' t park in front like this , it' s a federal building .
and she' s gonna do the same exact thing like i said .
nine milli , bullets and another nine milli .
what did you plan to do with all these guns , huh ?
maybe she was planning on taking out the whole building .
holy shit , what' ve we got here ?
lunch .
careful blood .
might be poisoned .
no man , there' s no anchovies on this .
is that what you call " i won' t be long " ?
i' ve been hangin ' around here for at least ten minutes !
i did my best .
avanti .
do you like it ?
yes .
so say it .
i like it .
not thirsty ?
you know , a girl' s first time is very important .
it determines the rest of her life sexually .
i read that once in one of my sister' s magazines .
my girlfriends told me that they hated their first experience .
that' s because they don' t love the guys .
they just did it to show off .
afterwards , they started liking it , like cigarettes .
i wanna like it , the first time .
mathilda , no .
why not ?
i just can' t .
you love someone else ?
no .
i mean ...
there was someone a long time ago .
before i came to the states .
her father didn' t want her to see me .
she was from a very respectable family .
mine was , you know ,
not so respectable .
her dad went nuts everytime she' d take off to see me .
but she still snuck off to see you , right ?
right .
you see , nothing can stop love , lon .
he killed her .
one shot to the head .
they kept him in jail for two days , then they let him go free .
they said it was an accident .
so , one night i waited for him
500 feet with a lens .
he also had an accident .
the same night i took a boat and came here to meet up with my father who was working for tony .
i was nineteen .
since then i' ve never left the city .
and ...
i' ve never had another girlfriend .
you see , mathilda .
i won' t be a good lover .
ok .
just do me one favor .
what ?
i' m sick of watching you sleeping on your chair .
we' re gonna share the bed .
i don' t think it' s a good idea .
it' s ok , put your legs upon the bed .
yeah , its nice .
put your head down .
it' s ok .
relax .
good night , lon .
good night .
manolo , take the kids in the kitchen .
i have a lot of respect for your business , tony .
when you' ve killed for us in the past , we' ve always been satisfied .
and that' s exactly why today is going to be very , very hard for me .
i hope you' il excuse my mood .
my man was killed right here on your turf and the chinks tell me that the hitman was kind of the ...
italian type .
so we figured that tony might know something .
wait , there' s more .
you' re gonna love this .
a few hours later , a little twelve year old girl comes into my office , armed to the teeth with the firm intention of sending me straight to the morgue .
and you know who came and got her in the middle of the afternoon , right there , in my building ?
the very same italian hitman .
i' m dying to meet him .
relax , everything' s fine .
sleep well ?
i never really sleep .
got one eye open always .
oh , i forgot .
you know , i never saw someone with one eye open snore so much .
i snore ?
like a baby .
i' m gonna get some milk for breakfast .
i won' t be long .
don' t forget the code when you come back .
two knocks , then one , and two knocks again , right ?
right .
hola senor .
ring these up and i' il go get some milk .
from here on out , you don' t make a sound .
you answer my questions by nodding " yes " or shaking your head " no " , you got it ?
is he alone ?
does he expect you ?
do you have keys to the apartment ?
is there a code , a way of knocking so he knows it' s you ?
alpha team , final position , we' re ready to go .
be careful .
move , move !
shit .
alpha team .
man down , man down .
i told you .
benny , bring me everyone .
what do you mean , " everyone " ?
everyone !
take this .
go take a look .
don' t move .
you see anything ?
it' s the guy .
he' s here .
he' s got a gun on my head .
ok , nobody moves .
let the girl go .
now , take it easy , man !
let the girl go !
ok .
the girl' s coming out .
let the girl go .
grab the axe off the wall .
over there , go .
you' re coming with us .
christ , he shot him !
bastard !
move !
move !
move !
move !
shut the fucking water off !
got it .
we' re in a bad way here , send the cats , i repeat , send the cats !
i don' t know what happened , i didn' t see them coming , i swear .
i just went shopping and i came back and they were everywhere .
stay away from the window .
lon ?
lon ...
come here .
snipers .
ok , now get this fucking asshole outta there .
how we gonna get outta here now ?
leave it to me , we' re checking out .
but lon , it' s not big enough for you .
it' s barely big enough for me .
we said no discussion .
no !
i' m not letting ...
i' m not going !
i won' t go !
i won' t go !
listen to me ...
listen to me , we have no chance together , but if i' m alone i can do it , trust me .
i' m in good shape , mathilda .
and i know i' ve got a lot of money with tony , a lot .
we' il take it and leave together , just the two of us , ok ?
go .
no !
you just say that so i won' t worry .
i don' t wanna lose you , lon .
you' re not going to lose me , mathilda .
you' ve given me a taste for life .
i want to be happy , sleep in a bed , have roots .
you' il never be alone again , mathilda .
please , go now , baby , go !
calm down , go now .
go , go .
i' li see you at tony' s .
i' m gonna clean them all .
tony' s in an hour .
i love you , mathilda .
i love you too , lon .
hey , heyeyey , what the fuck is going on up there ?
i just said take the guy out , not the whole fucking building .
hey , we got one breathing here .
get the medic over here ...
we got a wounded man here .
make way !
send him down by the stairs !
let him go !
let' s go !
move !
get that guy up the stairs .
lean him on the land .
get your team back up there .
we got two men coming down the stairs .
you ok ?
hey , i need a medic over here !
move your fucking asses .
squad number one what' s the status on the apartment ?
can' t see shit , too much smoke in here , give us five minutes to clear it up .
ok , you got it .
what , what , what !
you' re two hundred men and you can' t find one man and a girl ?
did you find the girl ?
hi , how' re you doing ?
take your mask off , quick .
let me see you .
that' s deep .
right , this one here .
you from the third precinct ?
yeah .
all right , fine .
put it down , put it down .
this one .
you stay there for two minutes , i' il be right back .
let me put the mask back on .
i breathe better with it .
ok , you' re right .
sit tight .
ok , come on , everybody out .
come on , let' s go , let' s go !
come on , out !
clear the way .
clear the way , men .
come on , what are you doing here .
get out , get out .
come on .
stansfield ?
at your service .
this is ... from ...
mathilda .
shit .
lon asked me to help you out if ... if something happened and ...
i think something happened , right ?
he put aside a little cash for you ...
so , what i' m suggesting is that ... seeing as how you' re still so young ,
i should hold the money for you , you know , ' till you' re older .
like a bank , you know , except better than a bank
because , you know , banks always get knocked off .
no one knocks off old tony .
but it' s your money and , in the meantime , all you gotta do is come here every once in a while and i' il dish it out so that you can have a little fun , ok ?
here' s a hundred bucks to start with .
can' t take any job instead ?
a job ?
what the hell can you do ?
i can clean .
i ain' t got no work for a twelve year old kid .
so get it outta your goddamn head !
it' s over , the game' s over , lon' s dead !
you hear me ?
come on .
come on , you think i ain' t hurting , too ?
but he' s dead .
and you' re gonna forget all this craziness and get your little ass back to school , capiche ?
now take this money and get the hell outta here , and don' t let me see your face ' till next month .
' cause something tells me i' m about to lose my famous kind streak .
my parents died in a car accident four weeks ago .
it was terrible .
you know , we didn' t have the time to get to know one another when you first came here , but i want you to know that i am not the kind of woman who' d let down a child , whatever her situation , whatever her mistake .
so , i' m going to help you and do my best to welcome you here again .
but on one condition .
you have to stop lying to me , mathilda .
i want you to take a chance and trust me .
now tell me what happened to you .
ok .
my family got shot down by dea officers because of a drug problem .
i left with the greatest guy on earth .
he was a hitman , the best in town .
but he died this morning and if you don' t help me , i' il be dead by tonight .
you know her ?
no .
i' ve never seen her .
i think we' il be ok here , lon .
he deals the cards as a meditation
and those he plays never suspect
he doesn' t play for the money he wins
he doesn' t play for respect
he deals the cards to find the answer
the sacred geometry of chance
the hidden law of a probable outcome
the numbers lead a dance
i know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs are weapons of war
i know that diamonds mean money for this art
but that' s not the shape of my heart
he may play the jack of diamonds
he may lay the queen of spades
he may conceal a king in his hand
while the memory of it fades
i know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs are weapons of war
i know that diamonds mean money for this art
but that' s not the shape of my heart
that' s not shape ...
shape of my heart
and if i told you that i loved you
you' d maybe think there' s something wrong
i' m not a man of too many faces
the mask i wear is one
those who speak know nothing
and find out to their cost
like those who curse their luck in too many places
and those who fear are lost
i know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs are weapons of war
i know that diamonds mean money for this art
but that' s not the shape of my heart
that' s not the shape of my heart
that' s not the shape ...
shape of my heart
