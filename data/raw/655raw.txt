good sleep ?
not bad .
so where are we ?
where you from ?
san diego .
left yesterday .
so you came honolulu guam pago here ?
long trip .
what do you do ?
l m a psychologist .
hey , a shrink .
they ve called in everything else .
how do you mean ?
we ve ferried people out of guam for the last 2 days .
physicists , biologists , mathematicians , you name it .
everybody being flown to the middle of nowhere in the pacific ocean .
what s going on ?
they re not telling us anything , sir .
what did they tell you ?
there was a plane crash .
do you get called in on crashes ?
l m on a list of psychologists the faa brings in when a plane goes down .
so where exactly are we now ?
that s where we re headed .
over there .
here .
take a look .
what is that ?
all that for a plane crash ?
i never mentioned a plane crash .
any other gear ?
watch your step .
l d like to call my family .
we il get you settled in quarters first .
remain there till we send for you .
l d like to get started .
we il send for you .
lt s critical i see them  who ?
the survivors . lf i don t get to them in the first 24 hours
what survivors ?
the survivors of the plane crash .
plane crash ?
i deal in post traumatic stress and survival guilt .
maybe i should talk to someone who knows what s going on here .
talk to the ship s psychiatrist .
l m a psychologist .
that s why i was sent here .
i told you people i need a phone .
discuss that with mr. barnes .
that s fine .
give me a phone , l il call him .
why are you here ?
take your hands off me , please .
do you have any idea who i am ?
tell him the name of the book you wrote .
astrophysics you can use .
it was a book of the month club main selection .
never heard of it .
you really thought he read your book .
you haven t changed .
it was written for the layman .
he s not impressed .
ls there a phone in here ?
l ve been trying to call my wife .
would you stop touching me ?
wait a minute .
beth ?
flight quarters .
all units make your flight quarters ... ... condition one stations for landing .
stay clear of the fantail
goodman , you been here long ?
l ve been here 3 hours .
welcome aboard .
this thing scares the hell out of me .
lt s already too late .
you might as well helicopter me back . . . . . . because the damage is done to the survivors already .
hold on .
we il get to that .
i don t even know who you are .
i know who you are .
who are you ?
navy ?
military ?
what are you ?
you ever hear of the ossa ?
they don t know who i am .
that should reassure you .
you haven t talked to anyone about this ?
i talked to the helicopter pilot .
what d you tell him ?
i told him i was here to see the plane crash .
that s my job .
plane crash .
good .
there was no plane crash .
spacecraft .
a spacecraft .
i guess that explains a lot .
nasa ?
that doesn t surprise you ?
at least it explains the secrecy .
the secrecy s critical , norman .
you made that explicit in your report .
what report ?
ulf .
i wrote that for the bush administration .
and that s our bible here .
but that was a report about a possible encounter with an alien being .
you want to come with me ?
oh , boy .
about 3 weeks ago . . . . . . a ship laying fiber optic cable between honolulu and sydney . . . . . . hit an obstruction 1 , 000 feet underwater .
cut this cable here clean as a shears .
the navy got interested , sent out a search ship .
it turned out that what did it . . . . . . was this .
we took this with side looking sonar .
this is an aerodynamic fin longer than a football field . . . . . . bigger than any known wingspan .
this is the fuselage .
this is ultrahigh res sls bottom scan .
came in a week ago .
there it is , buried under about 8 yards of coral .
something s wrong with that measurement .
pacific coral grows an inch a year .
you can set your watch by it .
that s right .
so you re saying this spacecraft crashed in the year . . . .
1709 .
so you re saying this spacecraft crashed 300 years ago ?
288 .
that s impossible .
lt s not impossible if this spacecraft came from an alien civilization .
wait a minute .
you think this is an alien spacecraft ?
lt s not impossible .
lt s ridiculous .
we think there s an unknown life form on the spacecraft .
that s why you re here .
you are the contact team that was recommended in the goodman report .
we have a biochemist . . . . . . to assess the physiology of the unknown life form .
a mathematician , because that il probably be our common language .
and we have an astrophysicist to locate its place in the cosmos .
led by a psychologist .
right .
nowadays , the little green men say ,  take me to your therapist  ?
listen up .
contact teams meeting an unknown life form or ulf . . . . . . must be prepared for severe psychological impact .
stress reaction of confronting such life has not been sufficiently studied . . . . . . and cannot be entirely predicted in advance .
but the most likely consequence of contact is . . . . . . absolute terror .
that s from norman s report .
l m sorry , are these parameters correct ?
you re saying that you have a spacecraft over a half a mile long . . . . . . that crashed into the ocean 300 years ago and it s completely intact ?
that s right .
and the kicker is , our sonar is picking up a low level hum .
something s still running inside .
there s no way this coral could ve grown faster than an inch a year ?
that s what we re going there to see .
what ?
who says ?
harry , that s a joke , right ?
this is the greatest scientific discovery since copernicus .
bigger !
the idea that we re not alone , it il change everything .
evidence of extraterrestrial life .
you don t want to see that ?
i got to say that i resent this briefing very much .
and how s that ?
lf norman s report calls for a biologist , a mathematician . . . . . . an astrophysicist and a psychologist . . . . . . why are you here ?
physical protocols start in a half an hour .
you always wear glasses ?
i just started wearing these .
are the glasses a problem ?
i don t actually need them .
they re just for reading .
and they re more of a crutch .
i see fine without them .
but they didn t anticipate l d be going 1 , 000 feet under the water .
do you take prescription medication ?
no .
none at all ?
once in a while sometimes i might take like a . . . . . . a piece of xanax or something if l m nervous .
something like that .
but not . . . . . . much .
knee surgery .
complete reconstruction of acl , right knee .
still have steel pin here , steel pin here , little medial collateral damage .
i see that you have a scar on your neck .
car accident .
were you drinking ?
yeah .
but i wasn t driving .
wait , i just want to apologize for putting your name on the list .
why ?
when i made the report a few years ago , i picked names of people i knew .
and ?
i know ted because of his father .
yeah , so what ?
beth was a patient .
lt s a bogus report .
what ?
did you tell barnes ?
you can t do that .
that s fraud .
they came to me , new administration , right ?
political agenda .
they said , in case of an alien invasion , do s and don ts .
why didn t you just say no ?
$35, 000 .
it paid the down payment on my house .
new administration wanted to prove they re doing something new .
how d you come up with this team . . . . . . of a biologist , an astrophysicist and a mathematician ?
right .
how ?
i don t know .
it sounded good , right ?
made them come to me .
i forgive you , norman .
i forgive you !
but i don t forgive you for ted .
he s a pain in the ass .
l il talk to him .
we il be there 2 hours .
you don t have to be around him .
he idolizes you anyways , but l il talk to him . l il buy you dinner .
l m sorry .
your secret s safe with me .
come on .
l can t believe this thing could . . . .
like a dream .
have you called your wife ?
why not ?
this il be a saturation dive .
you il be going to a habitat in 1 , 000 feet of water .
a sub will take you to the habitat and you il transfer aboard .
at 1 , 000 feet , your body will be pressurized for that depth .
you could actually take a quick dip .
the pressure wouldn t bother you .
although i wouldn t recommend it because the water s so cold . . . . . . you d freeze to death in less than 2 minutes .
that s the reason for the diving suits .
your helmet has a rebreather for your air supply .
following this briefing , l il take you to an onboard dive tank .
for the next 8 hours . . . . . . you il train in deep saturation dive techniques and emergency procedures .
once you ve gone down 1 , 000 feet . . . . . . if you surface , you il have to commit to several days of decompression .
there is no real quick return .
however , there is a mini sub . . . . . . that may be used as an emergency escape vehicle .
but there must be a ship at the surface to mate to for decompression .
without decompression , your body would literally burst .
under these circumstances , you re very well controlled .
the dive has been planned well and professionally monitored .
the descent will take about 13 minutes , descending at 80 feet a minute .
lt s going to get chilly .
try to relax .
next time , just tell us when you re going to push the button .
mozart . . . ... horn concerto in e flat ... ... k 447 .
how you holding up , captain nautical ?
l m loose .
you re loose ?
l m loose . l m loose .
l m uptight .
we okay ?
we re in the river now .
what river ?
lt s a temperature/ salinity differential .
it flows like a river inside the ocean .
under the ocean and there s a river .
that s right .
you okay ?
right now , l m not okay .
would you please not touch me ?
we re both nervous .
yes ?
would you cut that out , please ?
you re having a stress reaction .
that s harry s stress reaction .
those noises we re hearing , that s normal ?
those noises are the water pressure attacking the sub s integrity .
you know a little something about that , don t you , norman ?
how the pressure can attack your integrity .
come on , you be nice this trip .
were you nice last time ?
you two want to sit together ?
my god !
norman , look at this , look at this .
jesus !
that s just the fin .
that s the habitat .
the navy moved it in sections and set it up as a base ... ... as soon as the spaceship was discovered .
it' s manned by 2 naval personnel .
it will be your home away from home while we investigate the spacecraft .
it ain t the motel 6 .
approaching docking bay from r 4 .
all personnel , descent sub one engaging lock area .
you are now depressurized .
we re going to pressurize you now .
lt s hot in there , but you re going to feel coolness .
that s the helium .
helium ?
was i the only one paying attention ?
oxygen is a corrosive gas , in the same family as fluorine and chlorine . . . . . . hydrochloric acid , hydrofluoric acid .
that s why we re breathing helium .
because oxygen at any level higher than 2 . 3 becomes toxic .
can you run that by me again , ted ?
i don t speak balloon .
what ?
that s my voice .
the helium resonates differently with my vocal chords .  follow the yellow brick road .
kiddies , cut it out .
the voice regulators are behind you .
put them on .
the navy dive team is setting up a hydraulic robot . . . . . . in the air lock outside the spacecraft .
we il use that to open its door .
ls that the door ?
yeah , we used sonar imaging to pinpoint it before the divers went down .
how tall is that robot ?
five feet .
and it s roughly the same size as an airplane door , isn t it ?
excuse me , ted .
i think that s worth taking note of .
excuse me .
tell them our team is in place and ready , okay ?
this is habitat to navy dive .
has it occurred to anyone maybe we shouldn t open that door ?
why do you say that ?
we assume they il be green . . . . . . or insect like , but basically human .
but what if they inhale air and exhale cyanide gas ? lt s plausible .
or live forever , like a virus or a yeast .
but why would you assume that a ulf would want to kill us ?
an immortal creature wouldn t think killing was right or wrong .
lt d have no concept of it .
lnstant eradication . lt s what all the serious scientific stuff talks about .
what little there is on the subject .
you did put that in your report ?
lt s in there .
get us the etd for team s departure to surface .
tell them we re in ready and thank them .
habitat to navy dive .
our team s ready to take over .
descent sub ready for your return to surface .
thanks for all your help .
we il let you know what we find .
l m not too thrilled at the prospect of this .
what if you have to go to the bathroom ?
just go down your leg , ted .
really ?
you can urinate in these ?
you can .
the question is , do you want to ?
where s the switch ?
okay , let s go .
all right , fletcher . . . . . . we re at 1 , 022 feet .
the ambient temperature , 34 degrees .
heading out north northwest ... . . . 330 .
lt s a firm bottom .
lntermittent coral .
this is great , you guys .
look at the size of that thing !
my god !
you see that tunnel ?
that s where we re going .
lnto the heart of darkness .
we re in the coral pipe now , fletcher , approaching the air lock .
l m feeling pressure in my ears .
ls that normal ?
just use your equalizer .
a little better .
the most toxic creatures on earth live down here .
the venom of the land animal is nothing by comparison .
even the weakest sea snake is invariably lethal .
ls that supposed to make me feel good , beth ?
this is our air lock .
lt il take us from a wet to a dry environment .
we re assuming the inside of the ship is sealed .
this thing is enormous .
that' s not budging , is it ?
turn it at 45 degrees .
what s happening here ?
is that piston broken ?
can you get the suction cup flat to the plane of the door ?
maybe it s the hydraulics .
the pressure messes everything up at this depth .
time for a demonstration in basic physics , gentlemen .
what is it , harry ?
take a look .
lt s chipped .
all right , it s chipped .
so what ?
l thought you said this thing wasn t damaged when it crashed . . . . . . that this titanium alloy was so super strong , you can t hurt it .
i did .
so why does it chip when this scientist just bangs it with a hammer ?
ls there heat coming off this thing ?
you re right .
get out of there .
back up .
just a minute .
i mean , get back now !
get back .
jesus .
anybody else wonder who the hell opened that door ?
how did that happen ?
l m not sure about the atmosphere .
helmets stay on .
all right .
we come in peace .
always wanted to say that .
fletcher , inform the navy we ve gained access . . . ... to the spacecraft .
there' s a hell of a lot of radiation shielding in here .
huge grids of catwalks and plumbing . . .
. . . and a lot of steam .
lt s endless .
we il stay in touch here .
somebody s been here .
there s footsteps and they ain t ours .
so what do you say , norman ?
time to turn back ?
l m a little curious .
break up into 2 squads .
we il never cover the territory otherwise .
split up ?
he s got a point .
we ve only got about a half hour of breathing time left .
ted and harry , you come with me .
beth , norman , stick together .
come on .
i think the people who built this place would call that  divide and conquer .
whoever built this thing wanted us dead , we d be dead already .
these guys offer a federal grant to study the effects of an alien invasion .
i told all this to harry .
you made up the report ?
no , not all of it .
i mean , i did research on half of it .
who did the other half ?
i borrowed from , you know , good writers .
lsaac asimov , rod serling . . . .
rod serling ?
who would ve thought anyone even reads those government reports .
you know ?
i show up here , half the pacific fleet is here .
i just didn t know what to do .
i wanted to tell you , that s all .
ls this in the same category as ,  beth , i thought you knew i was married  ?
i don t think we have enough oxygen
oh , my god .
did you push something ?
no .
it did it on its own .
that must be the cockpit .
hold on .
look at this .
cross stress bracing on the outer hulls .
all axes supported .
look at this stuff .
this is interesting .
soft and strong at the same time .
lt s , like , better than rubber , better than steel .
you know a lot about this stuff .
i studied aeronautical engineering at m. l . t.
lsn t that where you got your ph. d. ?
lt s where i got mine .
all 3 of them .
i hated m. l . t.
envy ?
puberty .
how old ?
first ph. d. , 18 .
damn .
one year , harry .
you beat me by one year .
let s push on .
let s go .
man , they didn t tell you how heavy these things were out of the water .
look at this .
come here .
trash .
basura .
trash ?
oh , god .
jesus !
lt s human .
you mean humanoid .
no , norman , i mean human .
blunt force trauma .
you can see by the direction that the fracture runs . . . . . . that he was hit in the back of the head .
what s in his hand ?
i don t know .
what is it ?
smokehouse almonds  ?
my god , it s an american spaceship .
it can t be an american spaceship .
lt s 300 years old .
there weren t even americans , let alone spaceships .
it can t be , but it is .
let s see if there s some kind of flight recorder or data computer . . . . . . where we can ring up some kind . . . . . . of a flight history .
i mean . . . .
look at this . lt s in english .
come here .
okay , good .
right there .
and there .
look at the dates !
can t be .
could be .
it could be 2043 or 1643 .
i don t know which one is weirder .
unknown entry event .  press it .
you sure ?
this is barnes , norman .
yeah , i can hear you .
i can t explain it , but i think we re inside an american spaceship .
it gets better .
what the hell is it ?
whatever it is , it seems to be what this bird was designed to do .
go out into space and gather things like this up and bring it back .
yeah , but back from where ?
don t get too excited , ted .
turn this thing over , it il probably say  made in korea .
somehow i doubt that .
no doors .
no hinges of any kind .
l il bet if you put a laser micrometer on this , it d be a perfect sphere .
perfect to a thousandth of an inch .
that s a message in and of itself .
really ?
what do you mean ?
when pope benedict asked giotto to prove his worth as an artist . . . . . . giotto drew a perfect circle . . . . . . freehand .
perfection .
lt s a powerful message .
i know what the zen masters would say .
what s that ?
this ball wants to be caught .
nobody built this thing looking into their third eye .
they went to a lot of trouble and they didn t do it for nothing .
something put this thing out there to get picked up and brought back here .
have you forgotten the trojan horse ?
it could be a trap .
don t you think that s a little paranoid ?
no , l m going to put a video camera on this thing and keep an eye on it .
can i ask you something about this reflective surface ?
yeah , it appears to be mercury , doesn t it ?
except mercury s liquid at this temperature .
that s not what l m talking about .
what worries me is that it s reflecting everything but us .
i hate to be the one non scientist that picks this up , guys .
you know what i mean ?
what do you think it is ?
i don t know .
whatever it is . . .
. . . it s alien .
okay , an american spacecraft , materials , technology . . . . . . more advanced than what we know , crashes into the ocean .
why wasn t it damaged ?
the materials are obviously super strong .
lf that s true , why did it chip when you hit it ?
it didn t crash .
it arrived . . . . . . 300 years ago .
from where ?
not  where .  when .
so you re saying this thing took a wrong turn ?
that s right .
i mean , what if the craft . . . . . . inadvertently flew into a black hole ?
it arrived in our past from its present .
the dates in the flight record 43 , 47 .
that has to be 2043 , 2047 .
the image you saw , what you described . . . . . . sounds like a black hole , a tear in the space
we know what a black hole is .
i don t know .
lt s a collapsed star with so much gravity it s like a vacuum cleaner . . . . . . sucking everything into it , light , interstellar dust , time
time ?
lt s possible , but not plausible .
lt s more than probable .
lt s rudimentary astrophysics .
we just haven t been able to fly into one and prove it .
i just got off the horn topside .
they re expecting a bad blow up there .
and they re pulling us out .
pulling us out ?
wait a minute !
what do you mean ?
what part of  pull out  don t you understand ?
extraction .
we re leaving .
that s ridiculous .
we haven t even begun to scratch the surface here .
lf you ve ever seen a pacific cyclone , what we call a tornado is a little fart .
so i suggest you go back to the dormitory and take a nap .
you need to lower your metabolism before we start the decompression .
you re leaving a time traveling spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean ?
l m just following my orders .
we re the aliens welcome wagons .
but , no aliens .
it was made in america .
what s your point ?
my point is , l m a biochemist and there s no life down here .
what is wrong with you ? !
that doesn t mean there s nothing to learn , to explore !
she s right .
you guys are the human contact team for an unknown life form .
there is no unknown life form , so we pull out at 0900 .
please say something to him .
what ?
i don t know .
do you not have an opinion about this ?
l m delighted we re going back up top .
you know what i mean ?
this may look like a roadside diner , but in the meantime . . . . . . my ears won t pop and if i pull this thing away from my neck . . . . . . l sound like someone s squeezing my testicles .
let s go home .
barnes is wrong , you know .
you mean , wrong about the storm ?
no , about the sphere .
what about the sphere ?
lt s alive .
why do you say that ?
there s something inside it .
how can there be anything inside it ?
there s no door , no seams .
the sphere chooses what it will and won t reflect .
doesn t that seem like the actions of a conscious being to you ?
pop psychology .
i think , for whatever it s worth , you re angry . . . . . . towards our friend ted in there . . . . . . because he figured this out before you did .
you really think so ?
i don t know .
this is my first underwater session .
you re right .
ted did figure it out first , didn t he ?
good shrinkage .
we re all going to die down here , you know .
what ?
what ?
you see , it s curious .
ted did figure it out .
time travel .
and when we get back , we re going to tell everyone . . . . . . how it s possible , how it s done , what the dangers are .
but why 50 years in the future , when the spacecraft encounters a black hole . . . . . . does the computer call it an  unknown entry event  ?
why don t they know ?
lf they don t know . . . . . . it means we never told anyone .
and if we never told anyone . . . . . . it means we never made it back .
hence . . . . . . we die down here .
just as a matter of deductive logic , norman .
damn , i wish i could get inside that sphere .
what s wrong ?
talk to mr. barnes .
where is he ?
video feed room .
where is that ?
i don t know where the hell anything is .
where am l ?
where ?
what s going on ?
i don t know .
you tell me .
what the hell is he doing ?
i don t know .
do you know what he s doing ?
i need to know what you know .
nothing .
he wanted to go inside .
we are inside .
you mean outside ?
he said ,  inside .  what ? lnside the spacecraft ?
i think inside the sphere .
holy shit !
my god .
did he go inside ?
i don t think so .
what the hell s going on ?
he didn t just disappear .
i think it s a glitch in the video .
give me playback on that .
you il have it in a minute .
you knew he was doing this and you said nothing .
you didn t think !
i didn t think it possible .
where are beth and ted ?
i don t know .
i woke up , i heard bells ringing and i started running
i' m not getting an image on the sub .
impossible !
i got a cable in my quarters !
they il be here in 25 minutes or less !
the only logical explanation is that the sub is still at the surface .
ls it also logically possible your sonar is messed up ? !
let s just calm down , all right ?
he didn t just disappear .
we are not going to leave him .
you got that right .
i am not going to lose a civilian on my watch .
you have just screwed up our trip to the surface .
we are not going up to the surface .
harry !
we are not going up !
harry !
can you hear me ?
harry , can you hear me ?
norman , this is not a triage situation .
go find me ted and beth .
norman , stop .
still no reading on the sub .
forget the goddamn sonar , teeny .
when beth and ted get here , make sure they don ' t go anywhere .
all right ?
what the hell ?
can you hear me ?
ls he alive ?
we have a problem .
harry s out cold .
his pulse is normal .
all his vitals are normal ... . . . but i don t get it .
hello .
hello !
norman , can you hear me ?
we lost video here .
can you hear me ?
that tears it .
what , sir ?
we re on internal power .
i don ' t follow you .
they cut us loose , teeny .
for some reason the sub turned back .
break out your 5 day deodorant pads .
we' re here for the duration .
everything s normal .
what s going on ?
ls he all right ?
ls it true ?
did he go inside ?
what did he say ?
he didn t say .
he s aphasic .
he s asleep , ted .
i can t believe he went inside .
he didn t say anything ?
there s no door , no entry .
how did he get in ?
can i have your attention , please ?
we' ve lost contact with the surface .
the habitat is now operating solely under internal power .
we have plenty of food , oxygen and fresh water ... ... to sustain us until the storm is over ... ... and we reestablish contact with the surface .
but until that time , this mission is subject ... . . . to emergency authority under my command .
l m taking this out to the mini sub .
are you up on the duty roster ?
yes , sir .
where s she going ?
lt s procedures .
everything in the habitat is videoed .
every 1 2 hours we take the videos to the mini sub and press the reset button .
the idea is , if something happens to us and we don t reset it . . . . . . the sub goes to the surface automatically .
lf we re all dead , they at least have a partial record of what went wrong .
cheerful thought , huh ?
mind the store a minute .
l m going to the head .
what the hell s that ?
lt s so beautiful down here .
lt s so tranquil .
this is beautiful .
lt s hard to believe we have a typhoon 1 , 000 feet above our heads .
hey , it' s snowing down here .
you see them ?
there' s got to be a million ... . . . jellyfish down here .
man , this is really beautiful .
these jellyfish are getting a little friendly .
having a hard time seeing .
hey , guys , you getting this ?
it' s getting thick down here .
hello , hello .
i can ' t see what i' m doing .
they re sticking to my faceplate .
fletcher , this is dr. fielding .
just swim through them .
they re harmless .
guys , these jellyfish are everywhere .
fletcher , get out of there .
what are jellyfish doing at 1 , 000 feet ?
i think they feel the heat from my body .
i can t get them off me !
they re stinging through my suit !
get back to the habitat on the double .
i can t move my legs !
come back to the habitat .
they re inside my suit !
keep moving !
just keep moving !
help me !
jesus , barnes , she' s dead !
there' s no bubbles .
edmunds .
yes , sir ?
come on down here .
something ... ... happened to fletcher .
god !
when i was 5 years old i went out on a boat with my father .
he told me not to jump in the water , so of course i did and . . . .
oh , my !
i jumped right into a school of these guys .
not this big , though .
l think every one had a shot at me .
i don t know what this lady felt . . . . . . but , man , it went beyond pain .
l ve been . . .
. . . afraid of them since .
would you feel any better if i told you this wasn t exactly a jellyfish ?
you mean . . . ?
i mean , jellyfish like this are unheard of .
i don t know what this is , but it isn t god s creation .
here i am your special island
come to me
bali ha ' i
you can come in .
have a seat .
you want some coffee ?
no , thanks .
how well do you know dr. halperin ?
i used to teach at uc san diego years ago .
she came for her master s .
don t take it personally , but i assume she wasn t a romantic interest .
don t take what personally ?
she s a tall , vibrant , younger woman .
what s your point ?
you knew her as a patient .
l m not at liberty to discuss that .
you understand .
i understand an exotic gas environment 1 , 000 feet under water . . . . . . with no lifeline to the surface . . . . . . is about the most dangerous environment on the planet .
lf there s a problem , i got to know about it .
beth is fine .  beth is fine .
beth s fine .
she s very fine .
would you like to read this and tell me what it says ?
are these my actual notes ?
what does it say ?
how in the world did you get  does it say  suicide attempt  ?  electroshock therapy  ?
lsn t that what it says ?
what s your point ?
didn t it seem important enough to tell somebody ?
you were willing to jeopardize these people s lives . . . . . . to have someone here who could be mentally unstable ?
are you aware of the term ,  overreact  ?
we re 160 fathoms down .
and we ve got a nutbag down here who can flip out and crack up .
you selected the team .
why didn t you tell me ?
when i wrote this , i didn t know the team would be 1 , 000 1 , 000 or 10 , it makes no difference !
why didn t you tell me about beth ?
it wasn t pertinent .
that was not your call to make !
yes , it was and it still is .
it was a passive attempt .
a passive attempt ? !
those who really want to kill themselves shoot themselves or go over a bridge .
they don t call their boyfriend and say ,  i just took 20 nebutol .
help me .
she took 20 yellows , and you re telling me she s perfect .
what is it ?
come in .
lt s harry .

l m glad you like it , harry .
i love eggs !
they sure seem to cheer you up .
do you remember what happened ?
yeah .
i went inside .
how did you get inside ?
there are no doors .
there are doors all over this place and we can t get out .
we re still here .
yes , we are .
you didn t answer my question .
why are you looking at me like that ?
harry , are you saying we shouldn t still be here ?
where s teeny ?
i thought she did all the cooking .
she had an unfortunate accident , harry .
she was killed .

jellyfish .
jellyfish ?
that s strange .
yes , it is strange , isn t it ?
here you go , harry .
little onion rings .
look at that .
lt s not onion rings .
good , though .
guess what it is .
calamari !
you all right ?
cough , cough , cough .
no , you re doing it wrong .
i know what l m doing .
bring it up .
come on , bring it up .
he s trying to say something .
he s trying to talk .
you don t listen .
he wants to say something !
l m not choking , you asshole !
see ?
i hate squid .
i hate squid .
l m sorry .
i was trying to help .
you okay ?
harry , let me ask you something .
before you went in the sphere , you were convinced we would die here .
yeah , i remember that .
you still believe it ?
you afraid of dying , norman ?
bullshit !
he s hiding something and you know it .
he went inside the sphere and whatever it is he saw , he won t tell us .
he said he doesn t remember anything .
you bought that ?
the whole food thing was all a diversion .
the guy s willing to put all of our lives on the line . . . . . . because he doesn t want to share information .
i can see it .
he s making notes for a book .
he wants to win the nobel prize .
and you don t ?
norman , you ve known me since i was 17 years old .
i would love to be the guy who gets
do you know how respected
l m not ! l ve written one  fun with dick and jane  book on physics .
i mean , niels bohr . . . . . . he published  the quantum theory of atomic structure  at 28 .
einstein , relativity , 26 .
newton , gravity , 23 .
ln physics , if you haven t done it by 35 , chances are you never will .
this doesn t have anything to do with your competitiveness with harry ?
19 .
wunderkind !
i rest my case .
mr. barnes would like to see you .
why ?
something s wrong with the computer system .
try purging it .
i tried .
it just keeps coming back .
discharge from the buffer memory ?
i ruled that out .
the helium is getting to the chips .
lt s probably a saturation effect .
lf that s true , what are our options ?
you have to change all the chips .
forget it .
run this place on manual ?
lt s going to be a long 4 days .
hey , boss .
figured that out yet ?
lt s a saturation effect .
i don t think so . lf it s a saturation effect , it would be random .
what do you mean ?
this has a pattern .
see ? lt s like a code .
a code from where ?
how d you do that ?
how d you see that ?
try binary .
see ?
letter breaks .
you think this is coming from the sphere ?
don t know .
this mission is ultra top secret .
what you translate is for my eyes only .
lf you were it , how would you know our alphabet ?
same way it s configured on a keyboard .
but reflected in an orb , spherically .
a keyboard , but spherical .
take a keyboard . . . . . . wrap it around a sphere . . . . . . then starting at the center key , g , number the letters . . . . . . spiraling out .
you the man !
i still got it .
i still got the juice .
keyboard .
they let you keep those ?
here , you want them ?
all we got to do now is plug in the numbers .
friends . . . . . . in the 8, 000 years of recorded history , this is a first .
you re now on line with an alien intelligence .
you got to be kidding .
you must ve messed up the translation .
i don t think so .
lf this is right , this alien sounds like an idiot .
that s something to consider .
a stupid alien .
they must have them .
i will admit the message is childlike , but actually it s quite perfect .
lt s short , to the point , non threatening . . . . . . kind of the way you talk to a small child or a dog .
look at this .
he s making a speech .
ask him for his last name .
what ?
i want a full name for my report .
l m not putting in my report i lost a crew member on a deepsat expedition . . . . . . to find an alien named jerry .
please !  jerry  ?
we ought to tell him that we re enjoying it too .
ask him where he s from .
where are you from ?
i make a journey .
you make a journey .
we make a journey together .
i think jerry s channeling deepak chopra .
a journey from where ?
he s happy .
he s crafty .
what happened ?
damn , i think we lost him .
we re not alone .
we are definitely . . . . . . not alone .
lt s trying to make contact with us .
whatever it is , it was inside that sphere .
now it s out , free to act .
what do you mean by that ?
free to take over our computers . . . . . . call us on the phone , come knock on the door if it wants to .
a physical presence .
what are you thinking about ?
that last part where he said ,  i am happy .
don t you want jerry to be happy ?
honestly ?
what s on your mind ?
i would be happy if jerry had no emotions whatsoever .
because the thing of it is , here s jerry . . . . . . an emotional being , cooped up for 300 years with no one to talk to . . . . . . none of the socialization , the emotional growth . . . . . . that comes from contact with other emotional beings . . . .
so ?
what happens if jerry gets mad ?
what is that sound ?
did you hear it ?
you hear that thump ?
what is that sound ?
can you hear me ?
did you hear that thump ?
you are a hell of a woman .
i wish i knew you in the old days .
norman told me you were
norman told you what ?
let s put it this way , that if jerry could read your mind . . . . . . he d be bored with ours .
what is that sound ?
can you hear me ?
this is norman .
i get no answer from edmunds and there s strange noises .
something s going on .
it looks like edmunds is up on the side of the habitat .
i' m not getting anything on sonar , but watch yourselves out there .
would you hit your callback buttons , please ?
what d you tell barnes ?
about what ?
about me .
you told him i took 20 nebutol and tried to kill myself .
didn t you ?
he had my notes .
what do you want me to do ?
did you tell him who i called ?
oh , god .
come in .
did you guys find that thumping yet ?
