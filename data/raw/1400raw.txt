love is a song that never ends
life may be swift and fleeting
hope may die yet love' s beautiful music
comes each day like the dawn
love is a song that never ends
one simple theme repeating
like the voice of a heavenly choir
love' s sweet music flows on
like the voice of a heavenly choir
love' s sweet music flows on

you will , sometime .
on the meadow ?
perhaps .
hush now .
we' re almost there .
the meadow .
wait .
bambi , wait .
you must never rush out on the meadow .
there might be danger .
out there , we' re unprotected .
the meadow is wide and open , and there are no trees or bushes to hide us .
so we have to be very careful .
wait here .
i' il go out first .
and if the meadow is safe , i' il call you .
come on , bambi .

what did your father tell you ?
about what ?
about eating the blossoms and leaving the greens ?

eating greens is a special treat .
it makes long ears and great big feet .

yes .
nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the spring time .
yes .
nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the spring time .
for example , you' re walking along , minding your own business , you' re looking neither to the left nor to the right , when all of a sudden you run smack into a pretty face .
you begin to get weak in the knees .
your head' s in a whirl .
and then you feel light as a feather .
and before you know it , you' re walking on air .
and then you know what ?
you' re knocked for a loop .
and you completely lose your head .
gosh , that' s awful .
gee whiz .
terrible .
and that ain' t all .
it can happen to anybody .
so you' d better be careful .
it could happen to you , and you , and ...
yes , it could even happen to you .
well , it' s not going to happen to me .
me neither .
me neither .
twitterpated .
hello , bambi .
don' t you remember me ?
i' m faline .
bambi .
i bring you a song
and i sing as i go
for i want you to know
that i' m looking for romance
i bring you a song
in the hope that you' il see
when you' re looking at me
that i' m looking for love
i' m seeking that glow
only found when you' re young and it' s may
only found on that wonderful day
when all longing is through
i' m seeking that glow
only found when a thrill is complete
only found when two hearts gently beat
to the strains of a waltz that' s both tender and new
i bring you a song
for i' m seeking romance
you' re by my side there' s a moon up above
it shines with a light that' s so mellow and bright
it' s easy to see that tonight we shall fall in love
i bring you a song
for i' m seeking romance
and you

of a heavenly choir
love' s sweet music
flows on
