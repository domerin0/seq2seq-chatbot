i don' t know , but whatever it is ... it' s sharp as a son of a bitch .
what in the hell are we looking at ?
sharp enough to flatten a tire , whatever it is .
you know how thick that rubber is ?
have to be shot into it like a bullet .
jesus christ !
the damn thing has got teeth in it !
they can' t just whip the jack out and pump this mother up ?
the driver can' t change a flat on a bus .
they need a mechanic .
so ?
so , do you see any mechanics around here ?
you sucked so bad today , deaundre ... they' re probably saying you gotta change the flat .
... where she' il give us the latest update ...
lzzy ! on a continuing story ... we call " the horror in poho county .
hey , poho update !
well , peter , the fire which gutted ... an old church south of pertwilla four days ago ... continues to offer up a gruesome bounty .
county sheriffs excavating the charred ruins ... say the body count is now up well past three hundred .
county coroners say the bodies were found ... stitched to each other ... covering the basement' s walls and ceiling .
one on the scene witness called it ...
a human tapestry of torture and sadism " ... and " a sight he will never forget .
sheila , the details keep getting ... stranger and stranger every day this week , it seems .
any new information ?
some of the corpses they have found ... had false teeth made out of wood .
that means some of the bodies they' re finding down there ... are over two hundred years old .
but , peter , it' s the condition of the cadavers ... that' s the strangest fact of all .
the county coroner' s office reported yesterday ... that they have yet to find any one complete body .
believe that , man ?
no , they' re making it up . ... missing an external limb or an internal organ .
what connection this has
this is 226 , out on east 9 .
we are down and disabled .
home base , do you read me ?

with that thing out there ?
scotty , with that thing out there ?
scotty !
that thing hasn' t been back here in almost an hour .

i don' t understand how you would know that , sweetie .
a dead boy told me .
i think he was trying to warn me .
he was trying to warn all of us ... that this thing has been around for thousands of years ... and that nothing has been able to kill it .
this is a dream you had ?
well , the boy was dead , so , yes ...
i am assuming that it was a dream , scotty .
you were waving pom poms at people this morning .

are you going to believe it ?
and it doesn' t matter if we' re hiding on this bus ... or if we' re hiding under our beds .
