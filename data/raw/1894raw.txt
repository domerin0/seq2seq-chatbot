the legend tells us that at one time , the empire offered its most beautiful girls to the python god in return for prosperity ,,,
but , where today does our story unfold ?
in which epoch ?
jean cocteau said ;
legends have the privilege of being ageless ,
so , it is as you please ,
the dream of the python
i salute you , people of koumbi .
i salute your suffering , your poverty .
men and women , children and adults , dead and living , nobles and slaves ,
i salute you all .
i am grateful to you all .
i salute kaya maghan and his people .
woman !
the night belongs to spirits , the day belongs to doings .
listen !
hear you not the thunderbolt ?
see you not the whirlwind ?
trapped !
koumbi , you are trapped !
kaya maghan , leader of the universe !
they say your empire is boundless , stretching from east to west , from earth to sky .
but i , kerfa , am not impressed .
i fear nothing !
misery !
misery !
he who sows misery , reaps but penury !
misery !
misery !
he who sows misery , reaps but penury !
kaya maghan , your reign is eternal ?
false !
most false !
i say it loud and clear .
and i say it once again !
let go of me !
see ?
they fear my tongue yet they break my nose !
see the blood ?
look !
look !
kerfa , you are unreasonable .
what have you been saying ?
beware of those people .
the vulture does not sing .
the hyena does not dance .
people of koumbi , wake up !
sleep does not rule this world !
goats who would be free !
orphaned ewes !
hide yourselves !
stay away !
be gone !
the cruel feast of kaya maghan begins !
our customs are fundamental .
most true .
their root is memory .
their fruit is the given word .
welcome , honourable priests .
so the big day has come !
indeed .
the oracles have spoken ...
they have named sia yatabere .
she is the most beautiful , the most noble , and a virgin .
deliver sia to the python god' s lair .
there , we shall offer her up .
now you shall speak .
kaya maghan , it is for us to speak .
let that which has been said , be done .
kaya maghan hereby offers to sia' s parents their daughter' s weight in gold .
honourable , priests , beseech the python god to give us prosperity at last .
may he grant us long life , and to our children and grandchildren .
forgive me .
but sia yatabere is not free of engagements .
she is the fiance of my nephew mamadi .
he is at the front , leading our armies .
how can we offer up sia without telling him ?
it would be best to choose another girl for the rite .
the oracles have chosen sia , it is not up to us .
if this is how it must be ,
i shall summon mamadi so he can bid his farewells .
he must not come !
a soldier does not leave the front for his fiance !
what has been given may not be taken back .
we cannot rob mamadi of his betrothed .
rob ...
we are robbing nothing !
we are acting for the good of all !
kaya maghan , the head of your armies has blasphemed .
he must repent .
out of the question .
i have not blasphemed .
i have spoken the truth .
what has been given may not be taken back .
he is procrastinating .
humiliating us .
enough !
what has been said shall be done .
wakhane , you are right .
but you spoke more as an uncle than as the head of my armies .
mamadi shall be informed after the sacrifice .
what is it ?
nothing serious .
then speak .
the priests came to see us ...
we know .
indeed ...
they brought news to the palace .
honour has come knocking on your door .
balla , what do you mean ?
after consultation with the oracles ,
sia yatabere , has been chosen ...
your daughter .
balla , this news is overwhelming .
but tell our venerated emperor , if the country' s survival depends upon the sacrifice of my daughter , then so be it , may custom be respected .
nobility is not given to everyone .
of the yatabere nobles , you are a thoroughbred ,
yatabere .
in your daughter' s stead the emperor gives you the equivalent of her weight in gold .
tomorrow morning , at dawn , make her ready .
we will come for her .
yatabere .
fatou , dry your tears .
our pain is great , but we must save our honour .
what ?
my daughter is to die and i must hold my tongue !
that beats everything !
you too will die ...
death spares no one .
we all die one day .
but sia' s death is honourable .
sia !
sia , where are you going ?
do not flee .
wait , listen to me .
sia , my daughter ...
hey man , it seems that last night
sia ran away .
it' s great !
i hope she holds out .
for the good of all , we must find her .
stop blaspheming , it' s not good .
what ?
blaspheming ?
who' s fucking blaspheming ?
a girl is to be murdered and you talk of blasphemy !
mind your language , okay ?
you' re taking risks ...
wakhane has ears all over the place .
i don' t want any trouble !
let wakhane do what he likes with me .
i' il not sanction heinous crimes !
never !
never ever !
good day , noble folk !
yatabere , we have come to fetch sia .
yatabere !
worthy son of nobility !
we have come for sia .
sorry , but sia fled in the night .
what ?
fled ?
that' s impossible !
where has she gone ?
we looked for her , without success .
search every room !
if she' s vanished , sparks will fly for you and for me .
but much more for you .
well ?
she' s not there .
not anywhere .
nowhere to be found .
we' il be back .
find her !
where' s your friend sia ?
i' ve no idea !
let go of my daughter , she knows nothing !
take her away .
she' s in cahoots !
where is sia ?
grandmother , where is she ?
search the house .
no sign .
let' s go .
misery !
misery !
he who sows misery , reaps but penury !
what do you intend to do , wakhane ?
what shall you do ?
will you too pursue and deliver up sia ?
i am the head of the armies .
i have already told you , interests of state come before those of family .
do you understand ?
we have sought sia in vain .
no trace of her in the town .
what ?
you dare say that to my face ?
bunch of good for nothings !
i want sia here within the hour .
she' s hiding in the town .
arrest her parents immediately and all possible accomplices .
away with you !
the emperor has announced that all accomplices of sia shall be severely punished !
people of koumbi !
be reasonable !
error is only human , but to persist in it , is diabolical !
people of koumbi ...
python god !
god who devours his children !
his most beautiful daughters !
python most misshapen !
deep in your stinking cave what do you know of beauty ?
be gone !
all our daughters are beautiful !
in fact , all is beautiful in wagadu !
the earth , the sky , the sun , the stars , the water , even the wind !
did you hear ?
break the skull of that blasphemer !
we have orders not to touch him .
do not fear death !
death spares no one ,
if you are afraid , you will die ,
even if unafraid , you will die just the same ,
kaya maghan offers 18 kilos of gold to whosoever succeeds in finding sia !
sacrificing human beings , how appalling ,
human life is sacred !
i declare it , most solemnly !
sacrificing human beings , how appalling ,
misery !
misery !
he who sows misery , reaps but penury !
men and women !
heed what i say !
listen to the good news from the palace .
kaya maghan has announced that whosoever succeeds in finding sia will be rewarded with 18 kilos of gold .
the word of our emperor , kaya maghan !
men and women of koumbi !
informers !
may you be cursed to damnation !
kaya maghan !
master of the universe !
no need to hurry !
you shall soon drown in the misery of your people !
like this cat !
completely drowned !
be patient , you wretch .
we' il have your hide .
sia cannot have disappeared , it' s impossible .
wakhane .
i want her at my feet ... without delay .
wakhane , laxity is rampant in this country .
that madman insults me all over town .
and you let him do it .
you must understand .
kerfa would be more of a nuisance dead than alive .
as long as he speaks , he' s but a madman keeping the people amused .
but any violence unto him would make him a martyr .
you are right .
now , find sia .
as for the rest , we shall see later .
i know you enjoy kerfa' s talk .
kerfa is crazy , but not you .
beat them good and well .
and you , do your job , castigate them .
kaya maghan the benefactor !
python god the saviour !
they give us rain !
they give us gold !
they protect us !
very well .
lock them up .
and make them talk .
twins !
close off the town and root out that girl .
put down all subversion and resistance .
soldiers !
with one exception .
kerfa !
don' t touch him .
he continually insults the emperor !
do not touch him !
i said , not a hair on his head !
is that clear ?
it' s clear .
arrest them !
it' s him !
who ?
you !
why ?
let me go !
take them away !
let go of me !
mercy !
that' il do !
i know you regularly hold subversive meetings .
true or false ?
this farce has gone on long enough .
you will reveal sia' s hideout .
lock them up and put the screws on , until they talk .
take them away !
mercy !
bring forth sia' s parents !
who are sia' s parents ?
leave them be !
they are innocent .
bunch of cowards !
did you hear ?
i wasn' t dreaming !
she insulted us !
take her away !
sacrifice me in sia' s stead and stop torturing these people .
even if they are accomplices , they' il never confess .
they prefer death to shame .
they' ve got balls .
and you have none !
this girl is possessed .
lock the witch up !
on your feet !
so ?
still don' t want to confess ?
we know nothing .
we have no reason to hide her .
sia is not the first , nor will she be the last .
penda is right !
if i were an accomplice , i' d never own up !
in this land , bastards have a name .
we ought to find one for unworthy fathers !
woman , what do you mean by that ?
ignore her , she is beside herself , she is mad .
i am not mad !
wakhane knows what i mean !
let them go .
what ?
let them all go !
why does wakhane arrest everyone only to let them go ?
queen of queens , every ill has its remedy .
he knows what he' s doing .
it' s a subtle strategy !
wakhane is hiding something from you .
nothing !
wakhane can hide nothing from me .
without me , wakhane is nothing .
the corpse doesn' t play hide and seek with the undertaker .
fine !
don' t say i didn' t warn you .
cat is better than chicken ,,, all a question of recipe ,
where is sia ?
perhaps you know .
good for nothing !
she is not here .
she wouldn' t hide out with a madman .
from now on , mind your manners , or we' il break your face , crazy old fool !
move out !
kerfa , i' m afraid .
kerfa , listen .
i think he saw me .
have no fear , they won' t be back .
i don' t want to die .
no one wants to die .
who told you you' re going to die ?
it' s done !
come , it' s really good .
a delicious cat !
no , i' m not hungry .
then hide .
you said they' d not be back !
did i say that ?
perhaps it' s true !
but nothing is sure .
it all depends .
it' s red hot !
i don' t want to die .
then , you' il not die !
how do you know ?
the griots will one day tell the country' s children , that a young girl called sia yatabere was chosen from among the most beautiful to be sacrificed to the python god .
her fianc hastened to save her .
but sia refused to flee .
in the name of all girls sacrificed , she preferred to brave death ...
speak , kerfa !
i want to know all !
you' il know when the story has run its course ...
if you still live .
but you said i won' t die .
i fear for my parents ...
what does this story hold for them ?
what does it hold for them ?
they will be forgotten .
a father and a mother , are but a trifle .
a simple meeting .
i' ve just seen sia .
where ?
in kerfa the madman' s hut .
did anyone else see her ?
no , no one .
then don' t tell a soul .
have mamadi return from the front as soon as possible .
so he can say his farewells to sia .
does mamadi know i' m in danger ?
mamadi ?
who is mamadi ?
my fianc !
you just spoke of him ...
he' il come to save me .
oh yes !
mamadi !
he will come , but you won' t get far .
why not ?
wakhane' s soldiers are everywhere .
and you , what does this story hold for you ?
me ?
what matter !
all stories have their madmen , but madmen never have stories ...
sleep well , tomorrow will be a long day .
well ?
if your men don' t find sia , choose another girl !
there are lots of other virgin , noble girls in this land .
never !
it shall be sia .
i gave my word .
my authority will not be bargained with .
there' il be no affront to my power .
well said !
so what do you intend to do ?
you speak of authority ?
you have no more authority !
the people are party to this flight .
your authority' s been ridiculed .
your army leader will walk out on you .
i' m telling you again .
your griot and your advisors are but your echo .
a bunch of yes men !
wake up , quick , if you value your skin .
the fire burns the forest !
the water quells the fire !
the sand drinks the water !
the wind scatters the sand !
master of the sand , master of the forest , master of the water .
the greatest of great heroes , cisse !
so , honourable court ...
this sia affair is threatening the stability of the country .
you too , may have your say .
kaya maghan wants to have your opinion on the situation .
kaya maghan , my investigation is progressing .
my men are mobilised .
they are working on it .
give me one more day , just one !
and sia will be at your feet .
majesty !
the priests ' patience has its limits .
we must save the people from the python' s wrath .
the fate of the country is in our hands .
we must find another solution .
balla , what do you think ?
absolutely , what matters is the sacrifice .
never !
to give up on sia , is a slight to my authority .
how could you dream of such a thing ?
majesty ...
you are right ...
you are totally right !
if we give up on sia , the people will take it as a sign of weakness .
wakhane !
bring that madman here forthwith .
fetch him here , i want to meet him .
right !
that' s what we' il do .
cut out the tongue of that madman who incites the people to disobedience .
do not arrest him .
have him come .
i want to see him , meet him , speak to him .
speak to him ?
that bothers you ?
you , kaya maghan ... speak to a madman ?
i' d rather speak to a madman than to a bunch of puppet advisors , who are inapt and opinionless .
kerfa the madman , we salute you ,,,
stop !
i' il teach you !
little brats !
kerfa !
calm down !
filthy urchins !
it' s you who are crazy .
me , i have no name .
i even have no age .
i am invisible and imperceptible !
a curse on you !
and on your parents !
malingering parents who abandon their children !
let go of me !
what do you want ?
move , scum !
shut it and move !
get going !
majesty !
here is the man whose tongue has agitated the entire town .
this is he .
see ?
they' d have my tongue , yet they bind my arms !
stupid !
on your knees before justice !
no !
never !
never !
is your rule on its knees ?
if it is upright , i will remain standing !
break his face and his legs !
on your knees !
let him go !
lay not a finger on him .
if he wishes , let him stand and let him speak !
speak , me ?
it is for you to speak .
i didn' t ask for an audience .
i' m giving you the chance to repent .
if you don' t ,
i shall offer your life to the priests for having blasphemed .
kill me ?
i' m not afraid of death !
i know how to wake up when i die .
kaya maghan , you are not like me .
if you die ...
if you die , you do not know how to wake !
in fact , you are already dead , because you are asleep !
sleep does not govern .
leave us .
what ?
leave you alone ?
this man is mad !
i cannot .
i am responsible for your safety .
i said leave us alone !
untie him .
out .
all of you !
so you are kerfa the madman ...
he who insults me all over town .
despite all , i don' t wish to harm you .
i want you to speak for me too .
i want to be closer to my people .
speak for you ?
out of the question !
you have too many !
the griots , the advisors , the soldiers , already speak but for you .
i am tired of hearing them .
they' re a bunch of yes men .
i' m awash in an ocean of complacency .
that' s why i need you !
i want to hear the voice of my people !
kaya maghan seeks his people !
listen awhile to the murmurs of the town .
i have often listened , yet neither joy nor pain comes to my ears .
help me .
i want to know my people better .
he wants to know his people better .
your people are there !
outside !
today , they sing for you .
but tomorrow , they will trample you and sing for another tyrant .
the voice of the people is clear !
it resounds like an emperor' s fart , a fart that everyone pretends not to hear !
who are you ?
me ?
i am but the dream of others .
the dream of others ?
right !
then kerfa , be my dream too !
dream for my people !
what' s this ?
here .
what ?
take the throne and dream .
me ?
never !
keep your throne !
my dreams belong to me alone !
nothing is anyone' s !
all belongs to me , even you and your madness !
leave my madness alone !
hands off !
let me seek myself .
me , i seek myself !
he is already dead !
kaya maghan is dead !
kerfa !
i will kill you !
i' il wipe you out !
kill me ?
but i am already dead !
dead , but awake !
every day i die .
if you cannot die and wake , you are nothing !
believe me ...
nothing !
still here ...
where were you ?
at the palace , with kaya maghan .
kaya maghan ?
yes , with kaya maghan .
they' re going to kill me too .
kill you ?
why ?
because of me ?
no , because of myself .
they wanted my dreams , my madness .
i refused !
not just anyone can be mad !
you must earn it !
kaya maghan is thinking ahead , he wants to be rid of his advisors , his priests .
he wants to reach out to the people before the revolt .
but it' s too late .
the wind is against him .
the force of the waves will engulf him .
what are you on about ?
i don' t understand a thing !
he wants to make a hippopotamus of me and hang onto my back .
what he wants is ...
i don' t care what kaya maghan wants .
i want to live !
live !
women !
you can never fathom them !
she has the honour of being the prettiest and she gets angry !
the honour of the sacred sheep !
i am not a sheep , i am a woman !
i don' t want to be sacrificed .
help me .
get up .
listen ...
dry your tears .
he' s coming .
who ?
who ?
your horseman !
mamadi !
he who acts more than he speaks .
we' il see if he deserves his reputation .
come !
kerfa , i' m lost for what to do .
whatever you do , the story will run its course .
follow your instinct !
come , i' il take you away !
i thank you for having come , but we won' t get far .
your uncle' s men are everywhere .
nothing can stop me .
let' s be gone from here .
be gone from here ?
you mean , flee from here !
fleeing ...
always fleeing !
some valiant soldier you are !
don' t touch him !
he saved my life .
i' d have cut your head off !
thanks to sia , i spare you .
you fool !
my head wouldn' t make you a hero .
go see the python , he has seven .
you can chop off as many heads as you like .
be off !
i' il stay here and wait for death .
very well !
i' ve understood .
come and hide , carnage is brewing .
come .
i' m scared , mamadi is risking his life .
risk ?
risk is everywhere !
there' s as much risk at the front as in town ...
come and hide ...
come .
come !
seize her !
kerfa !
let go of me !
sia !
don' t worry !
whatever happens , i will be there with you !
in the python' s lair !
my uncle , you have betrayed me .
i' ve betrayed no one .
you have said your farewells to sia as was my duty .
now you have seen her , go back to your post .
i will never abandon sia .
then i must arrest you for desertion .
i no longer obey kaya maghan .
mamadi !
listen !
whatever you do , sia will be sacrificed .
there is nothing you can do , i' ve already arrested her .
you dare deliver my fiance to death with your own hands ?
sia' s death is no less worthy than the death you court at the front .
sia must die for the entire country .
sia will not die .
i shall kill the python .
what ?
did i hear you right ?
i shall kill the python to save sia .
you would kill the python god and dare say it to the head of the armies ?
i say it to my uncle .
it' s up to you , whether the uncle or the general heard me .
this boy has lost his wits .
lock him up !
do as i say !
listen !
we must take to the streets and say no to kaya maghan and his priests .
no way !
you' re crazy !
forgotten what we' ve been through ?
have you forgotten ?
next time they' il cut our balls off .
get out of here !
you lily liver !
kaya maghan is neither devil nor genie .
he' il not wipe us out !
he needs us in order to exist !
fine , if you want to die , off you go .
stop blubbering and work !
we bring grave news .
fraught with consequences .
twins , speak !
wakhane is preparing a coup d' etat .
mamadi has returned from the front to help him .
but they haven' t yet made their move .
we spied upon their plot .
we must act quickly !
are you sure of your accusations ?
of course , go to wakhane' s , mamadi is there .
wakhane has never been clear .
he must be dismissed .
balla !
go and get keletigui .
discreetly .
i appoint him head of my armies .
let him organise wakhane' s arrest .
at once !
good day , where is your husband ?
he' s sleeping .
sleeping ?
you seem pretty worked up .
wake him .
it' s very urgent .
keletigui , grave news .
wakhane is preparing a coup d' etat .
the emperor has named you in his stead .
quick , to the palace ...
wait , who' s spreading this gossip ?
the twins !
they overheard wakhane and mamadi plotting to kill the python god .
this information is false .
in any case , i shall remain loyal to my general , wakhane !
it' s false , isn' t it ?
that' s what i told the whole court .
wakhane could never do such a thing , he' s no traitor !
release your nephew , you are of the same blood .
we have given enough .
i repeat , the interests of state come before those of family .
bad news , the emperor is out for your blood .
why ?
what' s going on ?
i' m telling you , it' s serious .
the priests accuse you of plotting against kaya maghan .
they' re sure of it .
the twins told them .
kaya maghan has already dismissed you .
you' re in real trouble .
keletigui !
free mamadi .
the emperor has lost his mind .
he' s flipped !
you saw him !
he wanted to ally with kerfa the madman .
we are all in danger .
careful !
great master , from the dawning of time , we have been your griots .
you well know , i wish to die by your side .
untie him .
where is sia ?
there is no time to lose .
rally our troops and meet me at the caves .
incredible !
never does the vulture sing !
never does the hyena dance !
people of koumbi , you are cursed !
i hate your songs and dances .
they stink !
blind tam tams !
deaf tam tams !
blind tam tams ...
deaf tam tams ...
wakhane , keletigui and mamadi deserted before my very eyes .
exactly as we feared .
they must be found , arrested before they act .
balla !
i entrust the troops to the twins .
may they bring back wakhane dead or alive !
twins , the troops are yours .
what are you waiting for ?
follow me .
you want we act together ?
yes , of course .
it gives me the chance to make amends .
since they sacrificed " little mother " in her prime ,
i have been tormented by a feeling of guilt .
little mother " ?
yes .
who is " little mother " ?
my daughter ...
your cousin , " little mother " .
you don' t remember , you were only a child .
at sixteen , they delivered her up to the python .
i' il never forget the look on her face that day .
her distraught antelope eyes , begging .
my poor uncle ...
let me speak .
there is a time for everything .
do not console me , i am not to be pitied .
i am an unworthy father .
you know what " little mother " said to me on the day of the sacrifice ?
do you know ?
father !
you always told me that death was invisible .
i am not afraid of death .
it is the serpent that i fear ...
i beg you , father , blindfold me ,
i don' t want to see the python !
do you know what i did that day ?
do you know ?
i refused !
i closed my eyes so not to see her tremble ...
i sinned out of sheer pride .
i didn' t want that a girl of my flesh and blood tremble before death .
uncle , for " little mother " and for sia , we must kill this monster .
kaya maghan named me head of the armies to console me for her loss .
but it is impossible to forget .
my only reason to live is to take revenge upon myself .
mamadi , listen well .
what i' m about to tell you is capital .
tomorrow , i will make you kaya maghan .
kaya maghan ?
right .
i don' t understand .
you want to kill the python god .
when one kills the gods , one must reinvent the world .
i don' t want to reinvent the world !
all that matters to me is sia .
you have no choice .
if you refuse , i lay down our arms , we are arrested , sia is sacrificed .
is that your wish ?
so be it , uncle .
but why not you ?
no , you know how unpopular i am .
i have inflicted too much suffering upon the people .
they' il not forget that .
i' ve told you before , the people need heroes .
majesty , the town is on state of alert .
we have the situation under control .
there is nothing to fear .
and my people ?
are my people worried ?
what do they say ?
your people ?
your people is calm .
we' ve imposed a curfew .
the streets are empty .
good luck .
move out !
so ...
what news of kerfa the madman ?
you ordered me to protect him .
your instructions have been respected .
now ... do away with him ... and spread the rumour that kaya maghan had him killed because of his blaspheming .
go !
let go of me !
you , you , you ...
this way .
the others , that way .
remove your caps .
you , that way .
what happened ?
the python doesn' t exist ...
does it ?
so what happened ?
the priests raped me .
they stole my virginity .
all seven set fire to my belly .
you should have let me die .
i' d rather death ... than life .
i am completely sullied .
i want to die .
i want to die .
catch them !
where is kerfa ?
kerfa !
kerfa promised to die there with me ...
kerfa !
well ?
how did it go ?
answer me !
have you lost your tongues ?
the python god doesn' t exist .
what ?
what are you saying ?
in the lair , there were only some human skeletons .
no python ?
and the priests ?
they raped sia .
they were preparing to kill her , we put them all to death .
here are their soutanes .
let no one move from here .
wait for my instructions .
how is she ?
i don' t know .
she' s not speaking .
come ...

i do not speak of puppet heroes !
i do not speak of ordinary heroes !
but of heroes who defy all heroes , who have vanquished the underworld , who have overthrown a god , who have ended the bloodthirsty reign of kaya maghan .
heroes of the people !
the dog who defies the panther !
the lizard who defies the crocodile !
the people are proud of you !
the new ... new ...
kaya maghan !
your will is our will !
we salute you !
we salute you !
hero of heroes !
wakhane of noble lineage !

they are dead !
henceforth , you are free !
we shall open all the prisons !
our new power is the power of the people !
your power !
sia !
empress sia !
we salute her !
we salute her !
the new empress is tired after her ordeal .
an ordeal , such as only heroes can surmount .
let her rest a little .
in a few moments , she will shine like the full moon ...
here i am !
mamadi , what' s going on ?
what is going on ?
sia , listen to me ...
heroes who tremble ...
when i will have told all you will tremble even more .
it is we who saved your life .
we can reduce you to silence .
you want to perpetrate a lie ?
to change falsehood into truth ?
sia , do not wreck our hopes ...
i was raped , mamadi .
i was raped , sullied .
be patient .
she is not yet over the shock .
give her a little time .
mamadi , that' s enough .
now you must choose .
either she perishes , or we do .
let me handle this .
keletigui !
take her away !
wait !
arrest him for cruelty to the people !
arrest him , i am the new kaya maghan !
keletigui !
i said arrest that girl !
is that clear ?
arrest her !
mamadi , my nephew , well played ...
you did well ...
you' re a quick learner ...
ah !
little mother " ...
when i think of my daughter ...
she , who was so scared ... of snakes .
keletigui !
i name you head of my armies !
take wakhane away .
he was a great leader .
the new kaya maghan is dead !
dead in the well of endless falsehood !
dead from the very beginning !
that he die ...
that he live ...
what matter !
let go of me !
don' t touch me .
there' s no use in dying if you don' t know how to wake up .
keletigui !
take this madwoman out !
kaya maghan is dead .
let her be gone .
she has lost her wits .
men and women , children and adults , nobles and slaves ,
i salute you all !
i salute kaya maghan and his people !
the night belongs to spirits , the day belongs to doings !
people of koumbi , wake up sleep does not rule this world !
misery !
misery !
he who sows misery , reaps but penury !
misery !
misery !
he who sows misery , reaps but penury !
