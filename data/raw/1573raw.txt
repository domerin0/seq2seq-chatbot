puppet , sir .
only 10 piastres .
they' re crap , squirrel .
they fall apart before you' re out of the door .
five then , sir .
it' s handmade !
please .
my sister , she' s very , very sick .
i know your sister .
she' s peddling in the next bar over .
do you know my mother ?
no .
she' s very , very sick .
i' il give you two .
that' s a bad idea , you know .
like feeding pigeons .
do i know you ?
my name is semelier .
i work for a private collector of rare antiquities .
i cabled you last week .
yes .
and i didn' t answer .
there' s been a discovery in east africa .
a christian church , circa 5 a. d.
no , it' s not possible .
the byzantine empire had adopted christianity at that time ... but they never got that far south .
nevertheless , there it sits .
the british have financed a dig to uncover this church .
we believe a rare object waits inside .
we' d like you to find it and bring it back to us .
so you think i' m a thief ?
now you think i' m a thief and a whore .
no .
simply a man who' s lost faith ... in everything except himself .
ah .
you know nothing about me .
you' re an oxford educated archaeologist ... an expert in religious icons .
you were a priest before the war .
so what happened ?
this is a leather impression of the artifact we' re looking for ... a representation of a mythical demon .
it' s sumerian .
what makes you think it' s in a church in africa ?
a major granville in nairobi is in charge of the dig .
he' s been persuaded to let you join it .
you' re assuming that i will say yes .
you already have .
march !

mr. merrin , sir .
the major will see you now .
beautiful , aren' t they ?
it' s a hobby from school days .
works wonders for the nerves .
you should try it sometime .
what can you tell me about the dig ?
the location is a remote area of the turkana district ... called derati .
it was discovered several months ago by a detachment of my men ... on maneuvers there .
when the powers that be realized its importance , they organized a dig .
what have they learned so far ?
that it' s a church where no church should be .
this is father francis .
he' il be accompanying you to derati .
it' s a pleasure to finally meet you , father merrin .
i' ve read all your work at seminary .
it' s mr. merrin .
i was especially impressed with your treatise on the roman rituals .
i' m no longer a part of that .
i' m sure you didn' t come here to discuss catholic rituals .
i was actually headed to kenya to begin missionary work ... when rome learned of the discovery .
they' ve asked me to make sure the site' s religious aspect have the proper consideration .
hmm .
how come you' ve opened the site to the vatican ?
we haven' t ... officially .
you' re both my guests .
tell me , have you any theories on who might have built this church ?
well , not until i' ve seen it .
surely the vatican has some record of its creation .
i' m afraid not .
we' re as in the dark about it as you are .
how long have you been with the dig , chuma ?
since the beginning .
the british hired me as an interpreter .
what happened here ?
plague .
ravaged the valley 50 years ago .
how many died ?
all of them .
i' m lancaster merrin .
major granville should have contacted you about my joining the dig .
he did .
is something bothering you , mate ?
no .
i' d like to see the dig site as soon as possible .
you drink , merrin ?
i shouldn' t ... but my will is weak .
then you might just survive this place .
i understand you' ve uncovered the church dome ... but that progress has slowed down .
you could say that .
right , doctor ?
i' m sarah novak .
very nice to meet you .
lancaster ...
lancaster merrin .
you still haven' t made it by my room , doctor .
i' ve been having this , uh , swelling in the evening .
thought you might have something i could put on it .
how about a muzzle ?
so how are the interior excavations coming along ?
they' re not .
no ?
has the structure collapsed ?
no , the church is perfect ... but none of the men will enter , those we have left anyway .
why' s that ?
i shall be leaving for the dig in five minutes .
well ... pleasant fellow .
what' s wrong with his face ?
other than that it' s attached to his body ?
could be an allergic reaction or some kind of localized infection .
do you know why the men won' t enter the church ?
evil spirits .
oh .
if you believe the turkana .
and do you ?
no .
i' m a doctor .
but as a priest , surely you must believe in such things .
i' m an archaeologist .
i' m not a priest .
now , that' s funny .
i met father francis outside , and he told me you were .
did he ?
well , he is mistaken .
father merrin .
this is emekwi .
he' s donating the use of a room in his hotel for the mission school .
father , we are so glad that you are here .
these are my sons , james and joseph .
hello , james , joseph .
they are learning the bible .
we are , uh , christians .
hmm .
emekwi , can you see to mr. merrin' s bags ?
oh , of course .
james .
joseph .
very nice meeting you , doctor .
there' s your goddamn church .
is this your first assignment , father ?
before this , i was studying in the archives in the holy sea .
the vatican .
impressive .
but not really training for missionary work , is it ?
this is strange .
it' s 1, 500 years old .
it should be badly weathered .
it' s almost as if it were buried right after it was built .
chuma .
where' s jefferies ?
i need to go into the church .
hyenas ?
they' ve been here ever since we started digging .
even at daytime ?
no !
no !
no !
what' s the matter with him ?
i don' t know .
the heat ?
joseph ?
are you out here by yourself ?
it' s dangerous .
i' m collecting rocks .
i can see that .
i think you' re about ready for this now .
it' s a tool for professional diggers .
wow .
his seizure' s stopped .
i wanted to keep him at the hospital for observation ... but the turkana have stopped trusting my medicine .
well , that must make your job very hard .
you have no idea .
thank you .
so what is it you hope to find here ?
the answer to why a church was built here a thousand years before christianity arrived .
you were a priest once , weren' t you ?
yes , i was .
black bastards !
bloody savages !
can' t wipe their own ass without instruction .
i have to get back to town .
wait .
i , uh ...
i found this ... and , uh , i want you to have it .
it' s a st. joseph , for luck .
please , for my behavior .
thank you .
oi , oi !
what the hell are you doing ?
get the fuck out of here , you little scab !
don' t !
joseph , wait .
don' t do that .
all right , merrin .
i didn' t know you was a fuzzy lover .
it' s okay .
come .
these little buggers , they get in everywhere .
how soon can you have the doors to the church uncovered ?
a few days .
and in the meantime , how do we get in ?
we don' t .
chuma' il take you in through the roof .
following us , father ?
is it safe to walk around ?
let' s see .
lucifer .
the lord' s favorite angel .
cast out after the war in heaven .
can' t even trust angels , can you ?
you ever seen anything like it ?
not this far from rome .
it' s odd .
churches were built to exalt heaven ... but this , the weapons are pointing downward .
look behind you , father .
desecration of christ .
who would do something like this ?
the crucifix was broken off from here .
chuma , is there an inventory of what' s been found here ?
i wouldn' t know .
who would know ?
' cause this place has been vandalized .
probably the lead archaeologist , monsieur bession .
so where can i find him ?
i need to talk to him .
it' s not possible .
why not ?
he' s gone mad .
no one' s been inside bession' s tent since he fell ill ?
they are superstitious .
and you ?
not superstitious .
smart .
chuma .
yes ?
where' s bession now ?
a sanitorium in nairobi .
how long has he been gone ?
a few weeks .
and he can read and write aramaic ?
sorry ?
the language spoken in palestine at the time of christ .
and what does it say ?
the fallen shall rise ... in a river of blood .
do you have a moment ?
of course .
can i get you some tea ?
or maybe something more substantial ?
yes , that would be very nice .
you dabble in the occult ?
i found them here when i arrived .
i wanted to ask you , did you treat bession ?
you should let me clean that before it gets infected .
there was nothing i could do for monsieur bession .
he had no medical symptoms ... nothing to suggest any kind of disease or infection .
his breakdown was purely mental and extremely severe .
that' s why the turkana fear the church is cursed .
that and the disappearances .
in the past few weeks , we' ve lost a dozen men .
runaways ?
or is it those evil spirits ?
yeah .
i' m sorry .
i shouldn' t have .
your curiosity' s perfectly natural .
my father was a strong man .
when the nazis started rounding up the jews in our town ... he didn' t hesitate .
he hid our neighbors in the crawl space .
but someone turned us in ... and we were all sent to the concentration camps .
i' m sorry .
people can' t really understand , can they ?
if they weren' t there ... if they didn' t see .
no .
and my husband turned out to be one of those people .
i met him after the war , and we came to africa together , in love .
one night i realized i ...
i had to tell him the truth ... about ... the nazis ... and what they did to me .
after that , he never touched me again .
so ... what turns a man of the cloth into an archaeologist ?
i don' t know .
i suppose i ...
i wanted to work with something real , something i could touch with my hands .
do you miss it ?
being a priest .
no .
there' s no point in that .
sometimes i think the best view of god is from hell .
i should get to bed .
i' m going to nairobi tomorrow to see bession .
talk to father gionetti .
gionetti ?
he runs the sanitarium .
well , thank you ... for the medical care .
deliver us from evil ... for thine is the kingdom , the power and the glory forever .
amen .
you , priest .
what is your name ?
i' m father merrin .
god is not here today , priest .
want some water ?
hey , what' s wrong ?
it' s late .
you should go back to bed .
give it to me !
it' s mine !
oh , is it yours ?
give it to me !
mr. merrin gave it to me .
here , take it .
take it !
oh , just give it to me , you idiot !
who you calling idiot ?
take it !
it' s right here .
give it to me !
it' s mine .
shorty .
shorty .
shorty .
just give it to me !
all right .
okay , okay .
go back to bed , and i' il give you the stupid thing .
joseph , look out !
joseph , get papa !
get papa !
joseph , help me !
joseph , please , get papa quickly .
no !
help me !
help !
help me !
help me !
help me !
help me !
please !
what happened ?
hyenas .
they tore james apart .
did you see that , lancaster ?
the hyenas ignored joseph .
they were focused on his brother .
that was a lot more than focused .
they acted as if he wasn' t even there .
can you see ?
can you hear ?
come with me .
monsieur bession ?
mr. bession .
you worked on a dig in derati .
you drew a picture of an idol .
where did you see it ?
was it in the church ?
mr. bession .
father merrin .
how do you know my name ?
i said how do you know my name ?
are you hurt ?
no .
i' m free .
god is not here today , priest .
i hope he finds peace .
i' m father gionetti .
i' ve been waiting for you .
how did he know my name ?
have you drifted so far from god , merrin , that you can' t see ?
monsieur bession was touched by the devil .
demonic possession ?
forgive me , father .
i never said he was possessed .
only touched .
so , " touched .
what does that mean ?
in 1647 , the ursuline convent in loudon , france ... was plagued by possession .
thirty four nuns had been touched by the devil ... committing unspeakable acts .
having orgies including goats doesn' t make them possessed .
simply horny ... and inventive .
four priests were dispatched to exorcise the demons .
three of them were possessed themselves and subsequently died .
the last one was driven insane by his brush ... with evil .
that is what happened to monsieur bession .
and that evil remains in derati .
you must be careful there .
remember , he is the father of lies .
he will seek to poison your mind .
you will need this against him .
the roman rituals .
if you need somebody to perform an exorcism , i' m not your man .
i' m not a priest anymore .
you will always be a priest , father merrin .
only your faith can save you .
well , then i' m doomed .
joseph ?
what do you have there ?
can i see ?
you threw it away .
jefferies , what the hell are you doing in here ?
it was in the dirt outside .
you threw it away .
no , i didn' t .
the clasp must have come loose ...
liar !
do i repulse you that much ?
maybe if you could cure my fucking face ...
i might look as good to you as that archaeologist .
joseph ?
he' s coming for you .
what ?
he' s coming for you .
what happened ?
i had a bad dream .
ohh .
don' t worry .
you' il be fine .
where is everybody ?
sebituana' s baby is coming , so the village has gathered in welcome .
oh .
joseph .
hey .
joseph .
you' re back .
are you all right ?
yeah , i' m just a little bit tired .
these lesions ... they' re not from the shock , are they ?
no .
they' re completely asymptomatic .
it just doesn' t make sense .
he should have recovered by now .
so what is it ?
in this part of the world ... it could be a dozen things ... but his symptoms don' t really match any of them .
so all i can do is just watch and wait .
i have to do some work up at the dig .
will you be all right ?
hmm .
yes .
come sit with me , lancaster .
i promise i won' t bite .
what is it ?
how was nairobi ?
oh , fine .
did you see monsieur bession ?
he' s dead .
how ?
i don' t know .
some accident .
i just don' t understand everything that' s happening here .
it seems like i can' t help anyone anymore .
hey .
easy .
help me hold him .
emekwi .
i' m doing everything i can for him .
