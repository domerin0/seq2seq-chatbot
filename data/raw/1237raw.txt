what' s up , commissioner ?
hey .
leo , how you doing ?
if my mentor were police commissioner ,
i think i' d be getting a promotion too .
you know what i mean ?
yeah , is that right ?
yeah .
i got ears like a cat , son .
so let' s see what we can do about getting you that promotion .
test .
there' s a man sitting at the end of the bar ,
looks like he' s been sitting there for a while .
i want you to describe him .
and i want details .
well , you know what ?
i' m just here to have a good time , man .
that' s it .
oh , so talking to me is not your idea of a good time ?
or is it that you just can' t do it ?
i could do it .
ok , so go ahead , get yourself a promotion .
look at me .
he' s a white guy .
and ...
he' s got , i don' t know , a dark sports jacket .
i don' t know .
you know what ?
i' m off duty , man .
yeah , i know .
shepard ?
go .
white male , late 40s , 6 foot , 200 pounds , thinning gray hair , glasses .
he' s wearing two gold chains with some sort of medallion .
he' s drinking shots and paying cash .
and that' s why she' s an inspector , and you' re not .
the good inspector' s never off duty .
my office .
inspector shepard .
making an old man proud .
so ...
you pass the written ?
yeah , of course .
how could i not ?
trained by the master .
really , grasshopper ?
well , the master is amazed at how badly you almost fucked it up .
what ?
well , a moment ago , you demonstrated you still know how to process a room .
so tell me this , how did that psycho get a knife to your throat ?
no .
let me tell you .
you went there alone without backup .
and you didn' t tell anybody .
you didn' t follow procedure and you almost got yourself killed .
you know , you' re lucky you' re not being brought up in front of a disciplinary committee instead of being promoted .
you' re right .
i fucked up .
listen , it was an honor for me to raise you , to raise my partner' s child .
i' m just glad you made it through .
but you' re homicide now .
there' s no more room for mistakes .
copy that ?
copy .
nice kick .
i mean , what kind of moron tries to flush body parts down a toilet , especially when he' s got a perfectly good furnace out back ?
i' m gonna head out .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
where you been hiding ?
this is your night .
hey , the first female chief of police of san francisco right here .
mark my words .
oh , yeah .
to the chief .
to the chief .
you remind me so much of your father .
god , he would' ve been proud of you .
all right .
i want you to go straight home
and get some rest .
i will .
everything all right ?
yeah .
everything' s all right .
knob creek , neat .
do you live around here ?
what ?
any nightmares ?
insomnia ?
anxiety ?
panic attacks ?
nothing .
ok , here' s the deal .
this session is mandated .
it' s standard procedure for any cop who' s been through a traumatic experience .
plus , in this instance , the suspect got a little roughed up .
really ?
let' s get something straight .
i do not have a dog in this fight .
i am not the enemy .
anything you tell me goes right into the vault .
ok ?
unless i' m convinced a crime is about to be committed or you are a danger to yourself .
also , you being here does not jeopardize your promotion .
good to know .
anything else ?
you' re hoping i have some big problems .
frankly , i prefer to find people in perfect mental health .
well , then say hello to perfect mental health , doc .
ok , then .
hello , perfect mental health .
so you did kick culter ?
hands break , feet don' t .
you gotta get physical every once in a while .
what' s once in a while ?
yawara to the rib break .
yawara to the groin .
remember your distracters .
yawara to the sternum .
yawara to the clavicle .
yawara to the rib break .
yawara to the groin .
good .
let me see how you' re holding your yawara stick .
ok , put your thumb over here a little bit .
ok , perfect .
let' s do it again .
yawara to the sternum .
distracter .
yawara to the clavicle .
yawara to the rib break .
yawara to the groin .
hi .
i' m looking for inspector delmarco .
delmarco !
where the hell is delmarco ?
oh , you' ve got to be kidding me .
do i look like the kidding type ?
delmarco .
shepard .
follow me .
boys , meet inspector ...
shepard .
shepard .
flanagan .
dale becker .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
shepard , here' s a tip for you .
stumbling on a suspect does not an inspector make .
good luck , honey .
thanks so much .
dale was primary on the culter thing .
then you waltzed in with the suspect .
congratulations .
you' ve made enemies already .
this job is about the fucking work .
so how come you didn' t say anything in the bar last night ?
i couldn' t .
i was following someone .
oh , yeah ?
who ?
you .
ask her .
she knows what she did .
she picked me up and she lured me to that place , sir .
and then she got rough .
that' s it .
that' s the simple truth of it , mr. porter .
i had no idea she was a police officer .
i mean , isn' t that some form of entrapment ?
then she handcuffs me , i' m down on my knees .
she kicks me in the face , knocks me out cold .
come on , isn' t there some law against police brutality , sir ?
i' m going through a lot of pain and suffering , mr. porter .
yeah .
well , i' m very sorry about that , edmund .
but now that i' m on the case , we will be petitioning the judge to reconsider your bail .
we will be pursuing many , many other options .
ok ?
i know your little dirty side .
i know you .
you' re me .
come on .
ray , please tell me you are not gonna represent that loser .
that loser' s daddy is culter pharmaceuticals .
i golf with him tuesdays at the olympic club .
he' s asked me , as a favor , to defend his boy .
i' m gonna do that .
is that a problem ?
when you were assistant da , you used to love to nail bad guys ' asses to the wall like trophies .
raymond porter .
i wonder whatever happened to " crime doesn' t pay " ?
gee , delmarco , i don' t know .
whatever happened to " innocent until proven guilty " ?
i mean , do cops ever make mistakes ?
how about you , mike ?
ever make a mistake ?
yeah , you know what i' m talking about .
would you excuse us ?
i need to speak with jessica for a minute .
in private .
ok , that guy , delmarco , tends to go off the deep end .
you be careful .
ray , you got a client with a string of murders in his past .
wait a second , every defendant has the right to his day in court .
that young man has no prior convictions ...
ray .
he' s the guy .
i nabbed him in the act .
well , sometimes nabbing the bad guy is the easy part .
the hard part is learning how to relax .
yeah .
maybe you know someone who could help you with that ?
i think about that night .
i think about it all the time .
always thought you' d come back ... ... but you never did .
this fucking skell runs around grabbing up girls , sticking a knife into them , murdering them .
hell , he deserved a piece of your mind .
yeah , ray will say he was cuffed , and that you violated his civil rights and all that bullshit , blah blah blah .
but the bottom line is , it' s your word against his .
he was resisting .
remember that .
and that' s your story and you stick to it .
don' t get fancy , don' t get creative .
just stick to your story , you' il be fine .
hell , everything' s fine .
and what' s not fine can be fixed .
right ?
i guess culter did impact my life .
he got me promoted .
so ?
do i pass ?
well , almost .
there' s just one more thing i' d like to talk about today .
shoot .
i' m an open book .
i' d like to talk about your parents .
my parents are dead .
they were killed in a car crash .
ok .
so ... ... now that' s what you tell people .
thought this was supposed to be related to my job .
i don' t see what my parents have to do with my job .
well ... ... 25 years ago , your father went on a killing spree which ended with your mother and his own suicide .
and you' ve devoted your life to tracking killers and you don' t see how it relates ?
you sure ?
i barely remember my parents .
i was raised by john mills , my father' s old partner .
ok , but it ...
it could be your anger problems ...
i don' t have anger problems .
i don' t have any problems .
i feel fantastic .
wow .
aren' t you lucky .
what' s your secret ?
jessica , listen to me ,
my job is to help you deal with your feelings ,
i deal with my feelings plenty ,
hello ?
i miss you , mom .
shepard .
shepard ,
where' ve you been all day ?
mike ?
be outside , i' il pick you up in 15 minutes ,
we got a 187 , ok .
jess .
hey .
how are you , wilson ?
all right .
wilson , delmarco .
you remember wilson , my old patrol partner ?
hi .
hey .
ok , here we go .
any signs of cause of death ?
i don' t know , man .
but at first glance , i' d say he was beaten to death .
what' s the score ?
we' re up three , top of the fifth .
jesus christ .
who' d you piss off ?
ok , what have we got here ?
let' s take a look .
interesting .
ok , inspector , let' s see what you got .
i don' t think it was done here .
right .
good .
so ?
we should check the tide charts .
what' s that ?
hey , lopez , my key still good ?
yeah , mike .
anytime .
tomorrow .
she' il be waiting .
marine unit , my old unit .
tomorrow , me and you , we gonna go for a little boat ride .
hey .
check it out .
cigarette burn .
nice .
perfectly centered .
looks fresh .
yeah , let' s get a photo .
get me a photo here .
close up of the cigarette burn .
nice and tight .
ok .
one more .
good .
thank you .
looks like he' s been hit with a blunt instrument .
precise .
very professional .
something like this .
now batting , first baseman , j , t , snow ,
ok , see you later .
you all right ?
don' t sweat it , you' il get used to it .
it' s not that .
i think i know him .
his name' s bob , he drinks gin .
nothing more you can tell us ?
i told you , i don' t really know the guy .
i met him once , about a month ago .
but you said you were intimate ?
i picked up a stranger in a bar and had sex with him .
you ever picked up a woman in a bar , lieutenant ?
yeah , in my fantasy life .
all right , i' il give it to parker and lewis then ...
hey .
wait a second .
hey .
what is she , a suspect ?
come on , we got the call .
all right , it' s yours .
okey dokey .
we have got bob sherman .
confirmed death , eight , nine hours prior to discovery .
the weapon is a small blunt object , and the kill shot is a blow to the right temple .
although this guy was definitely beaten postmortem as well .
and trace evidence ... ,,, nada .
look , there are no fibers , no hairs .
i tented this guy .
i even super glued him up .
i could not raise a single latent .
sorry .
shepard ?
we' il talk later .
hey , mike .
we' il find the current that carried this guy here .
last night was windy .
flood tide was about five knots .
the body could' ve drifted a long way .
i bet they could tell us what happened .
they' ve seen all the bodies floating on the tides .
they' ve seen all the smugglers .
there' s hundreds of different dumpsites , hiding places .
heroin , cocaine , illegal pharmaceuticals , party drugs .
you name it .
i' ve chased a lot of guys right down in there .
i know every nook and cranny , every secret spot .
i' m like the sea lions .
they' re my neighbors .
see that place in there ?
you live there ?
you' re one big surprise after another , stranger .
you up for a cappuccino ?
you up for finding out who done it ?
ok , inspector , back to work .
so , what exactly are we looking for ?
well , i assume you checked the victim' s cuffs last night , right ?
i also assume that you would' ve seen there was sand inside those cuffs , which tells us ...
maybe he was dragged along the beach .
exactly .
let' s go check out the beach at crissy field .
i don' t think anything would' ve happened here .
too risky .
not if it were late at night .
so anyway , the ex confessed after we shook him a little .
great .
delmarco , shepard , where are you guys on yours ?
crime scene is clean .
no weapons , no prints , no witnesses .
we' re going out to known associates and neighbors .
all right .
anything else ?
all right , let' s break it up .
yeah , actually ,
i' d like to put word out to be on the lookout for similar victims coming in .
males , 20 to 30 , severely beaten .
wait a second .
you got only one body and already you' re thinking serial ?
i mean , what is this ?
spotlight withdrawal ?
here' s some advice i like to share with new inspectors .
it' s sort of like homicide aa .
one body at a time .
ok ?
your boyfriend .
he' s not my boyfriend .
he' s an ex and he' s the reason i don' t get friendly with my co workers anymore .
well , that' s good to know .
let me talk to him .
thank you .
shepard .
jessica , yeah ?
bridge patrol found another floater , someone pounded the shit out of him ,
ok .
how much did we drink last night ?
well , maybe next time you should go easy on the sangria .
i must have gotten wasted .
i kind of blacked out .
too bad i wasn' t there .
big inspector now , so you don' t call me back ever , right ?
i guess that' s the reason .
you patrol guys wanna rustle me up some breakfast ?
a little bacon , eggs , toast , black coffee .
seeing as how you' re not busy .
fuck you , delmarco .
make that bacon crisp .
check it out .
yeah .
there' s the cigarette burn .
it' s our guy .
ok .
let' s get him out .
keep it level !
ok .
good , a little more .
how' s that ?
right there .
all right .
we got him .
the guy was in the system .
lawrence geber .
dob 12 11 68 .
had a dui a while back .
see you later , man .
ok , bye .
tell me about it .
how did you know there' d be another body ?
there was that cigarette burn on the back of the hand .
it' s not a simple homicide .
cigarette burn' s intentional .
a signature .
what' s up ?
i can' t say i' m happy you were right about this , but it was a good call , shepard .
nice going .
all right , let' s get on this fast .
i want this guy stopped before the bodies pile up .
this guy thinks he' s a pro .
this guy thinks he' s being careful by covering his tracks .
not with me , baby .
everybody leaves something behind .
all i need is one little speck of blood .
just one little ... ... drop .
oh , yeah .
oh ...
like this little drop , for example .
you see the blood spatter on the front of his body .
that matches the angle of the blows .
so , what' s this little drop of blood doing all the way back here
behind his ear ?
could be the killer' s .
how soon will you know ?
well , i' ve got to extract it for dna , i' ve gotta amp it ,
i gotta type it .
that' il tell us with absolute certainty whether or not that drop matches the victim' s blood .
and , if i may say it , you are looking a little rough around the edges .
i' ve been a little stressed .
you have been .
at one point , you did suffer from some stress related symptoms .
from when i was 6 ?
is that what you' ve got there ?
my parents had died and i was sad .
i didn' t know how to handle it .
and what we have been discussing , your parents , your childhood , that all could be stirring up a lot .
dr. frank .
i am working on my first case .
looks like it could be a big one .
turns out i' ve slept with both the victims .
that' s why i brought it up .
you know , for someone who' s supposed to understand people , you' re a little slow on the uptake .
jessica , listen to me .
you have to tell your partner about this or your lieutenant , or someone in the department .
and what if it isn' t a coincidence ?
what if you' re in danger ?
fucking phone .
shoo !
go away !
go away !
goddamn it .
easy does it , jessica .
you all right ?
yeah ... ... just a few rats under the car .
rats .
yes , well , we live near water .
see you next session .
yeah , we' il see you .
i just can' t believe ... ... that there was no warning .
that he just went ... ... off like that .
your father loved your mother very much .
so much , in fact , that it twisted him .
you know what i mean ?
you know , sometimes i wonder if maybe i hadn' t told him about her .
about her affairs .
look , you need to focus on your case .
do your job .
that' s the most important thing right now .
hey .
ok , here' s the deal ,
you all know about serial killers taking trophies , a behavior which often gets them caught .
well , in the past , there have been killers who tried to smarten up , didn' t take trophies .
instead ... ... they " signed " the bodies .
it' s been done in different ways : cuts ... ... brands ... ... burns .
but signing the bodies might not be that smart after all .
because the signature itself ... ... can be your best clue .
so cigarette burns .
we gotta think we' re looking at a smoker and the overkill ...
the overkill suggests some rage .
any questions ?
oh , me !
me !
me .
i was wondering , have we eliminated
inspector shepard as a suspect ?
that' s very funny , dale .
no , mike , i' m serious .
i mean , we know she slept with victim number one , right ?
sure .
yeah .
so do we know if she slept with victim number two ?
i mean , shit , shepard , he is kind of cute .
motherfucker !
get off me !
come on !
cunt !
take her outside , mike .
i' m cool .
i' m cool .
dale !
in my office !
back off .
bad joke .
you made your point .
now let it go .
yeah , it is a bad joke .
you wanna know the punch line ?
i did sleep with victim number two .
why the hell did you do something like that ?
listen , brother , it is none of your business who i sleep with .
hey !
who the fuck cares who you sleep with ?
i' m talking about you lying to me !
ok ?
because partners tell each other the truth !
well , i' m telling you now !
she says she met these guys in a bar .
our killer' s probably trolling the same places , and he was probably stalking her .
just to consider all options , any enemies ?
anyone got , like , a sick fixation on you , might be stalking you ?
lately , i' ve ... ... sort of felt like i' m being watched .
so how do we handle it ?
do we pull her off the case ?
no .
you need to operate as though this is not a coincidence .
that' s the smart thing to do .
from that angle , we pull her , it might tip the killer and we blow a good lead .
and if she is connected , we' re gonna need her help to find out how .
that' s gonna put her at risk .
she' s a cop .
she knows the risks .
ok .
hey .
thanks a lot for backing me up in there .
backing you up ?
i was just giving my professional opinion .
you want my personal opinion ?
just what the hell do you think you' re doing ?
i' m not doing anything .
yeah ?
well , that' s not what i hear .
these men you' ve been seeing .
and today , you attacked a fellow inspector .
oh , it was a ... ... a disagreement .
and what' s going on with you and this delmarco genius ?
for god' s sake , john .
he' s my partner !
ok .
look , i know it' s a new century and people think it' s ok to just have sex with whoever .
but let me give you some advice .
don' t shit where you eat .
keep your social life separate from the job .
i do .
john , i know you worry about me and i love you for it , but i can take care of myself .
really ?
is that why people keep dying around you ?
nice .
nice .
may i have your attention , please .
s. f. p. d.
did i say that out loud ?
hey , i know you .
you come in here all the time .
you' re a cop ?
i don' t believe it .
believe it .
i did think you were kind of hot for a working girl , but i couldn' t figure out why else you' d keep taking off with those guys .
get it straight .
we are not here to discuss your opinion of me .
we are here to discuss a guy who used to look like this , and now looks like this .
so i know for a fact he spent time in here .
who' d you see him with ?
look , the only person i' ve ever seen that guy leave the bar with , aside from his girlfriend , was you .
the bastard was always late with the rent .
played drums at night .
serves him right .
know what i mean ?
did mr. geber have many regular visitors ?
the last person i saw him with looked a lot like you .
seemed like he' d fuck any skank that came on to him .
you find out anything up there ?
we just wasted the entire day tracking down me .
good .
at least we have a suspect .
it' s a joke .
fuck you , mike .
how did you get in my place ?
now , is that any kind of welcome for a man who' s seen you naked ?
what do you want ?
i' m kidding .
i' m kidding .
i mean , i just ...
i just wanna ...
i wanna see you .
come on , jimmy , it' s over .
i ...
i do .
don' t you miss me just a little ?
i miss you .
what do you want ?
how many times do we have to go over it ?
you know , it just ...
god , jimmy !
come on , knock it off !
no , no , no .
let me touch you .
jimmy !
just let me touch you .
jimmy , knock it off !
just , please ...
fuck .
jimmy !
i need you ...
holy fuck .
oh , my god !
jimmy , man , i' m sorry .
get off of me !
get off !
holy shit !
hey .
hey , here .
get away from me !
goddamn it !
get away from me !
oh , my god .
you know what ?
you' re a goddamn psychopath !
you know that ?
you' ve got a screw loose , man !
wacko !
bitch !
holy shit !
i' il be seeing you !
jim ...
when did you first find out ?
when did you realize ...
when did you realize that you had the capacity to kill ?
to take a human life ?
you know , we all have it in us .
you .
me .
it' s a matter of who can control it .
can you ?
jessica ?
what the hell are you doing here with my client ?
a little police work .
following through on some hunches .
oh , some hunches ?
i wanna be here when you talk with him , ok ?
every fucking time !
you got that ?
you don' t have to have a hissy fit , ray .
i' m cool with that .
edmund , do you remember what i told you ?
ok ?
only in my presence .
jesus fucking ...
i am not having a hissy fit , ok ?
i am protecting my client' s interests here .
and you , you have got a real battle on your hands here .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
i' m coming at you
with both guns blazing .
at me ?
what did i do ?
oh , yeah .
let' s just say the law works in mysterious ways , ok ?
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
well , i will explain it to you in detail .
but this is not the time nor the place .
let' s say you come over to my house sunday morning and we will talk about it .
you know .
like old times .
god , i love that perfume .
see you .
thank you .
sometimes i could kill that guy . ... the arresting fucking officer ... ... without me present !
you got that ?
never !
ok , ok .
don' t have a hissy fit , mr. porter .
the good news is , i was right , as usual .
that tiny little drop of blood , no way did it match the victim .
so we have our killer' s blood ?
well , the bad news is , he wasn' t in the system .
codls , the convicted felon database , it gave me zip .
so all you gotta do is bring me the guy' s blood that matches my sample .
that' s all , huh ?
hey , that' s why they pay you homicide guys the big bucks .
surely , you have some leads .
bring your good pal lisa a little blood sample , will you ?
and i , one of law and order' s little people , will burn the midnight oil , doing the task , making the match that will lock that fucker up .
and you get all the glory , and what , do you ask , do i get ?
hey , perhaps a dinner at chez panisse .
downstairs , i would hope .
working late ?
still going over all those unanswered questions ?
the biggest question of all still being , why is someone who would normally be considered a prime suspect being allowed to participate in this investigation ?
you got something to say to me , becker , quit being such a pussy and come out and say it .
i' il say it , all right .
and i' m not gonna hold back because you' re well connected to someone protecting you .
i' m not gonna let you drag this department through the mud .
are you listening to me ?
i know about you .
i know about you and bob , and i also know about you and larry .
let me ask you ... ... while you were sleeping with them , were you thinking about hitting them ?
are you thinking about hitting me right now ?
go ahead .
you know you want to .
you know , i don' t know about this case , but i do know one thing for sure .
every bone in your body wants to hit me right now .
am i right ?
yeah , who is it ?
it' s jess .
hey , come in .
it' s open .
how could you ?
how could you do that to me ?
what' s the matter with you ?
how could you tell dale about the victims and me ?
what ?
i was just starting to trust you .
hey , listen to me !
you think i' d betray our loyalty ?
i would never do something like that !
what' s the matter with you ?
what do i have to do ... ... to show you that you' re my partner ?
i' m sorry .
where the hell do you think you' re going , partner ?
we got work to do .
are you gonna let me in on this thing or what ?
i' m starting to realize i have more enemies than i thought .
everybody has more enemies than they think .
but the only reason why dale and the other guys give you a lot of shit is because they' re afraid that you might be better than them .
i love the way you eat .
you know , john would never tell me anything about my mother .
it didn' t matter what i asked , just a complete no fly zone .
except at dinner .
he tells me i eat just like her .
two fisted .
yeah .
what can i say ?
i get hungry .
me too .
sorry .
sounds like a little animal in your chest trying to get out ,
sounds like flesh ,
you are in for a battle on this one , jess !
i' m coming at you with both guns blazing ,
ray ?
ray ?
anybody home ?
ray , i am not jumping in there with you .
what is it ?
looks like he was beaten , thrown in the hot tub , and he' s got the burn on the hand .
let' s just get this over with .
it' il take about five minutes .
it' il be standard form questions .
let' s go ,
i still think it might be best if we just pulled her off the case .
do you have any physical evidence on her ?
anything to indicate that she might have killed these men ?
no , of course not .
didn' t think so .
just knowing them is not proof of a crime .
proof of bad judgment , yes .
but i' m not pulling her from her first homicide case .
it would kill her career .
she' il come through this .
just watch .
and your involvement with all these victims was ,,,
intimate ?
yes .
do you think it' s possible to do things behind your own back ?
maybe i drink too much .
i don' t know .
i ...
i pass out , and when i wake up i think i' ve done terrible things .
what is it you think you' ve done ?
there' s been another murder .
and i' m my best suspect .
this third victim ... ... i slept with him too .
jessica , listen to me .
you grew up your whole life knowing that your father has done these horrible things .
so now you may be thinking , " i have that in me too .
i don' t think i have it in me .
i know .
am i losing my mind ?
i have violent dreams , flashes ,
i' m hearing voices , when did you first find out ?
when did you realize that you had the capacity to kill ?
to take a human life ?
get away from me .
go !
hey .
i ... ... need this right away .
right away takes 24 hours .
lisa , please .
i need it .
ok .
i' il skip a couple of steps , and i' il run it straight through the amplification process .
you know , i always say , you can tell a lot about a person from a drop of their blood .
can you tell if they' re a good person ?
give me a little time .
angela .
yes ?
i need you to run this up to the lab .
get a toxicology screening , and i' m still gonna need to type it .
ok .
thank you .
hi , it' s lisa from the lab .
i need to see you right away .
you' re a goddamn psychopath !
you know that ?
bring me a drop of the killer' s ,,, i know about you ,
let' s say you come over to my house sunday morning ,
are you thinking about hitting me right now ?
killing spree , killing spree ,
tell me something , ,,, saw him with looked a lot like you , ,,, i' ve ever seen that guy leave the bar with was you ,
have we eliminated inspector shepard as a suspect ? ,,, keep dying around you ?
what is it you think you' ve done ?
i can hear your heart beating ,
one body at a time ,
sounds like blood ,
i know you , you' re me ,
at least we have a suspect ,
so now you may be thinking , " i have that in me ,
we all have it in us ,
the capacity to kill , capacity to kill ,
you ok ?
why wouldn' t i be ok ?
i tried calling you .
something' s wrong .
you know that feeling you' ve been having that somebody' s been following you ?
i' m getting that same feeling tonight .
something' s gonna happen tonight .
get away from me .
put the gun down .
go away .
what are you doing , jess ?
mike ...
mike .
you' ve been drinking .
you gotta stop .
you' ve gotta be strong .
mike ...
no .
give me the gun .
give me the gun .
everyone who kisses me ... ... turns up dead .
no , they don' t .
mike , don' t go .
i ain' t going anywhere , stranger .
hello ?
mike ?
you asked to see me ?
turn and face that wall .
test .
the bulletin board behind you .
go .
crime scene photos .
three black and white .
two color .
two black and white .
three color .
what is going on with you ?
you know a couple of victims , so you just let yourself fall to pieces , is that it ?
i think i' m losing it , john .
hey , you have a job to do .
hi , jess .
what the fuck , jimmy ?
jimmy , just go home .
oh , go home .
like i' m some kind of dog .
like i' m supposed to obey you now ?
is that it ?
we' re gonna rumble ?
open the fucking door , jessica .
open the door .
i' m coming to get you .
i' m coming .
jessica shepard ?
chip marshall , sld .
where were you the night of september 25th , the night bob sherman was killed ?
i don' t know .
the night of october 1 st , the night lawrence geber was murdered ?
i don' t know .
the night of october 5th , the night ray porter was killed ?
i don' t ... ... know .
jessica , did you kill these men ?
i don' t ...
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
i don' t know what else there is to say .
i was raised to be a good girl , but i was born to bad people .
it' s kind of comforting , in a way .
i' ve been running from it all my life ... ... the fear of being the bad seed .
but most of all , i feel bad for john .
it' s ok , though .
it' s good .
it' s good that i' m in here .
it keeps other people safe .
have you given her any medication ?
no , i' ve given her nothing .
i didn' t think so .
the problem' s not in her head , it' s in her bloodstream .
what' s in her bloodstream ?
report from forensics .
i had them run her blood through a drug screen .
rohypnol .
ever heard of it ?
yeah , of course .
roofies .
it' s a date rape drug .
completely incapacitating .
get dressed .
you' re out on bail .
thanks for all your help , doc .
we won' t be needing your services anymore .
all right , give me the headline .
and don' t tell me you' re not up for a test .
this is the biggest test of your life , inspector .
four men murdered .
suspect slept with all of them .
incriminating evidence found on her person the morning after the crimes .
when she awakened from a drug induced blackout , which makes it physically impossible for her to have committed the crime .
i didn' t do it .
stick to business .
the crime remains the same , only the suspects change .
who ?
what do they have in common ?
just me .
who knows your habits ?
whose job is it to know where you are at all times in case he might have to call you at any hour of the day or night ?
no , you' re off on that .
mike never knew where i went at night .
didn' t this start when you got the new job , when you met him ?
it' s not mike .
all right , i need you to tell me where to go .
straight down market to the embarcadero .
but why would mike drug me ?
how better to incapacitate you while he went about the business of doing what he had to do ?
do you think he' d let you prowl without following you ?
there were times when i felt like i was being followed .
suspect follows the accused .
when ?
where ?
the night she picked up a man in a bar .
followed the victim back to his place where he watched you do what you do through a window or maybe a crack under the door .
just enough to make him crazy .
come on , inspector , i' m waiting for you to tell me something .
suspect had ... ... intimate knowledge of the habits of the accused .
access not only to her place , but to her deepest fears .
plus , familiarity with the drug that ultimately incapacitated her .
remember , he' s a cop .
we give him the benefit of the doubt .
no doubt .
he' il get all the benefits he deserves .
you got out .
why didn' t you come see me , mike ?
yeah , why didn' t you come see her , mike ?
what do you mean ?
i was there .
they brought me in .
they questioned the hell out of me .
i told them you were innocent .
how could you be so sure ?
hey , jess .
you' re my partner .
we' re partners .
partners lie for each other ?
what are you talking about ?
partners tell each other the truth .
partners tell each other everything .
hey .
partners come see you when you' re in jail .
you didn' t get my message ?
oh , god .
there was no message .
you' re so fucking full of shit .
i was there .
somebody put me on the " no access " list .
excuse me , can i help you with something over there ?
looks like you were having some wine before we got here , mike .
you celebrating something ?
no , i' m not celebrating anything .
what the fuck is going on here ?
i' d like to propose a toast .
what ?
to jessica .
you got a problem with that , mike ?
no .
why would i have a problem with that ?
what' s going on here ?
is this some kind of joke ?
you gonna toast or what ?
here' s to my partner .
ok ... ... somebody better say something .
rohypnol .
rohypnol ?
yeah , rohypnol .
and ?
what ?
date rape drug .
you ever heard of it ?
of course i' ve heard of it .
roofies .
roofies .
that' s what you hip guys call it , right ?
i seem to remember you had a little girlfriend who od' d and died from this stuff .
so you know what roofies do , don' t you ?
what the fuck is going on here ?
somebody has been following me since these murders began .
someone has been drugging me .
how ?
somebody who was lurking around .
you know , who was in my place .
incapacitate you , don' t they ?
they make you feel confused and anxious ?
you ... ... feeling confused , mike ?
any anxiety ?
you put something in my wine .
whoa , this is quite a stash you got here , mike .
stash ?
a little of this stuff must go a long way .
you plan on date raping a whole sorority house here ?
you planting evidence ?
shit !
this is not my stuff .
listen to me , this is not my stuff .
party drugs .
whoa , lookie here what i found .
this is one of those ...
what do you call it ?
a yawara .
those little japanese sticks that pound your features to a pulp .
it' s not mine .
they didn' t have these in my day , but i heard you' re an expert with one of these .
that' s not mine .
this one' s got some blood on it .
i wonder if that' s jimmy' s blood .
you think that could be poor jimmy' s ?
you didn' t care too much for him , did you ?
i seem to remember you threatened to kill the poor bastard .
you' re not going for your gun , are you , mike ?
mike !
no , no , no , no !
no bruises .
just take it easy .
take it easy .
we' re in this together now .
partners .
and now you understand .
so we got a cop killer here .
a man who' s committed a very special crime that requires a very special form of justice .
step one , make sure the crime scene is clean .
don' t you touch anything , darling .
step two , no sign of physical restraints or struggle .
step three ...
... motive .
in this case , i' d say , oh , remorse for what he' s done .
unlucky in love .
that always works too .
what are you doing ?
tomorrow ... ... when those crime scene boys show up ...
photos never lie .
they also save on those messy courtroom appearances and some asshole judge letting him out on bail .
and now you understand ,
we' re in this together .
give me the weapon .
step away from mike .
what ?
put your hands behind your head , and get on your knees .
don' t you understand ?
understand what ?
i' m doing this for you !
get on your knees !
put your hands behind your head !
rule number one , you gotta be crazy to be a cop .
you ever heard that old saying ,
everybody runs away from a man with a gun , but a cop runs toward him " ?
give me the gun , jess .
you' re not gonna use it .
do it !
do it !
do it !
your father had that same rage .
i told him about her .
i had to !
he was my partner !
you tell your partner everything !
you always tell your partner the truth !
i told him she was fucking that hippie scum !
he lost his mind , ran in the house , i heard arguing .
look , all my life , i wished that ...
hey !
you killed them all .
they were scum .
don' t you understand , darling ?
they weren' t good enough for you and her .
you have the same emotional problem .
you have her disease .
i' ve tried to cure you .
you cured my mother by killing her ?
she was ruining my life .
she was ruining her life and your father' s life .
i loved her .
i couldn' t let her keep doing those things .
there was no other way .
you killed my father .
you couldn' t stop killing .
stop ?
i stopped for all those years , and i can stop again .
control , jess .
it' s all about control .
give me the gun .
i kill you , i kill a fleeing felon .
you kill me , you commit murder .
we' ve heard everything you said , commissioner ,
you don' t need the gun , commissioner ,
test .
identify the voice you are listening to .
i' m here , jess , i got you ,
recognize the voice of officer wilson , my old patrol partner ?
go along with the program , sir , you don' t want to destroy her ,
move .
come on , come on .
let her get the capture , commissioner ,
hold him there , jess , i' m coming ,
maybe some asshole judge will cut you some slack .
10 4 , backup units rolling , code three , we' re on our way , jess ,
well done , inspector .
well done .
you outsmarted the master .
that means i did my job well .
there' s just one more test you have to pass .
don' t !
no room for mistakes .
test .
no !
mike .
there she is .
let' s go .
move it !
come on , we got one in the water .
officer down .

always got your back , jess .

it' s cold out here , kids .
