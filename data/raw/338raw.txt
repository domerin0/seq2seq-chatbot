for those who haven' t read the plaque , we' il read the plaque .
here men from the planet earth first setfoot upon the moon .
july 1969 .
we came in peace for all mankind .
if this isn' t an insanely beautiful woman , i' m hanging up .
sir , i think you should listen to this .
goddamn it !
sir ?
come on , baby .
come on !
this better not be another damn russian spy job !
air traffic say the skies are clear .
it' s the real thing .
a radio signal from another world .
let' s not jump the gun here .
get online with space command .
they' re gonna want to know ...
what' s with the golf balls ?
you' re gonna kill me !
wait , this can' t be right .
the calculated distance from source is only 375, 000km .
it' s coming from the moon .
who else knows about this ?
setl in new mexico identified a signal .
but , they' re even more confused than we are , sir .
major !
yes , sir .
radar reception has been impaired , but we were able to get these .
we estimate that it has a diameter of over 550km and a mass roughly one fourth the size of our moon .
what the hell is it ?
a meteor ?
no , sir .
no , definitely not .
how do you know ?
well , sir , it' s slowing down .
it' s what ?
it' s slowing down , sir .
get me the secretary of defense .
wake up him !
hello .
hi .
it' s me .
hi .
what time is it there ?
it' s 2 . 45 in the morning .
i know i didn' t wake you .
as a matter of fact , you did .
liar .
i have a confession to make .
i' m sleeping next to a beautiful , young brunette .
you didn' t lether stay up watching tv ?
did you ?
of course not .
you' re coming home
right after the luncheon ?
yes , yes .
mommy ?
here' s your mother .
hi , honey !
i miss you .
president whitmore' s approval ratings have slipped below 40 % ...
he' s good .
are the salad days over for president whitmore ?
leadership as a gulf war pilot is different from leadership in politics ...
daddy let me watch letterman .
traitor .
they elected a warrior and got a wimp .
morning , george .
morning , mr president .
that game couldn' t have been pretty .
thank you , sir .
connie , you' re up awfully early this morning .
they' re not attacking your pollcies , they' re attacking your age .
' please , sir , i' d like some more . " '
that' s clever .
i' m not laughing .
age was not an issue when you stuck to your guns .
you were seen as young , idealistic ...
now the message has gotten lost .
it' s too much politics , too much compromise .
isn' t it amazing how quickly everyone can turn against you ?
it' s a fine line between standing behind a principle and hiding behind one .
you can tolerate a little compromise if you' re managing to get something accomplished .
well , the orange county dispatch has voted you one of the ten sexiest men ofthe year .
that' s accomplishing something !
mr president , it' s the secretary of defense .
yes .
could you say that again ?
so why are you waiting ?
my social security will expire , you' il still be sitting there .
i' m thinking .
yeah , well , think already !
do you know how long it takes for those cups to decompose ?
if you don' t move soon , i' il start to decompose .
listen , david , i' ve been meaning to talk with you .
it' s nice that you see me so much now ...
don' t start , dad .
it' s been ... what ?
four years ?
you' re still wearing a wedding band ?
three years .
you' re divorced , move on .
this is not healthy .
no , the smoking is not healthy .
checkmate .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
wait .
this is not checkmate .
see you tomorrow , pop .
hold on !
this is not checkmate .
oh ...
checkmate !
we' ve got everybody we have working on the problem .
i love x files too .
i hope you get to see it .
david !
what' s the point in having a beeper if you don' t turn it on ?
i was ignoring you .
what' s the big emergency ?
it started this morning .
every station' s making like it' s the 1950s .
we got static , snow , all kinds of distortions .
nobody knows ...
there' s a reason we have bins labelled " recycle " .
what the hell is going on ?
my god in heaven !
so sue me .
david !
we got a problem !
did you switch transponder channels ?
please !
you think i' d be this panicked if it was so simple ?
ok , let' s point the dish at another satellite .
we tried that .
it didn' t work .
it' s almost as though they weren' t there .
all right .
what have we got here ?
this is impossible .
the signal' s all screwed up .
stop it !
just leave it alone .
you' il break it !
it' s so fuzzy .
oh , no .
morning , lucas .
you see these ?
i got a whole goddamn crop full ofthese .
if your father' s not in the air in 20 minutes , i' m getting someone else .
russell !
hey , miguel !
russell !
what are you doing ?
just what in the hell do you think you' re doing ?
it' s the wrong field , you idiot !
lucas' s farm' s on the other side oftown !
are you sure ?
cns is running a story that we' re covering up a nuclear testing experiment .
they can run with it if they want to embarrass themselves .
nasa wants to know our position .
our official position is we have no official position .
what is going on here ?
guys , would i keep you out ofthe loop ?
absolutely .
what ?
i can' t hear you .
at the moment our satellites are somewhat unreliable .
isn' t it possible that this thing mayjust pass us by ?
what if it doesn' t ?
why don' t we target some icbms to blow it up ?
and risk turning one dangerous falling object into many ?
we don' t yet know enough to make any kind of intelligen tjudgments .
luckily the press is making up their own story for now .
but that' s not gonna keep .
we may need to upgrade to defcon 3 .
absolutely .
general , tell norad we' re on defcon 3 .
that' s not what the president said .
isn' t that a bit premature ?
over 50 % of the armed forces are on weekend leave .
plus the commanders and troops that are in town for the fourth of july parade .
the object has settled into a stationary orbit .
well , that' s good news .
not really , sir .
part of it has broken off into nearly three dozen pieces .
smaller than the whole , yet over 15 miles in width themselves .
where are they heading ?
they should be entering our atmosphere within the next 25 minutes .
take us to defcon 3 .
please say we' re gettin ' somewhere .
there' s good and bad news .
what' s the bad news ?
there' s a penalty for disturbing my lunch .
and the good news is you won' t charge me .
no .
the good news is that the problem is not our equipment , but a weird signal embedded in the satellite feed .
that' s the good news ?
yes .
it has a sequential pattern .
once i find the exact binary sequence ,
i can calculate the phase reversal and apply it .
we should be able to block it out .
and then we' il be the only guys in town with a clear picture !
yes !
yes !
david !
that' s why i love you !
that' s not necessary .
too kind .
this had better be good .
admiral on deck !
sir , we' re looking at a total radar blackout over a 13km area .
let' s do a diagnostic check .
excuse me , sir .
the radar may be malfunctioning , but the infrared is totally off the map .
jeez !
get me atlantic command on line .
hang on , sir .
sir , we have visual range with incoming over iraql air space .
second sighting ?
yes , sir .
just came in from the persian gulf .
correction , sir .
we have two confirmed visual contacts .
mr president , they' re tracking another one off the california coastline !
all right , put it on .
general , you might wanna watch this .
ladies and gentlemen , we are interrupting ourregularbroadcast to bring you extraordinary events taking place in russia .
this unexplained disturbance and the resulting hysteria are incredible .
how would you describe what you are seeing ?
it is clearing the mountains , moving too slowly to be a comet ormeteor .
widespread panic has gripped the countryside as thousands have taken to the streets .
it is confirmed .
the unexplained phenomenon is headed for moscow .
we have an awac offthe west coast .
eta with contact point , three minutes .
don' t understand it , sir .
side radar doesn' t see a thing .
i know !
i' m blind , sir .
nothing is registering .
negative .
we have zero visibility .
visibility is at zero .
command , this is eagle eye 370 .
captain , the president is listening .
repeat what you just told me .
we still have zero visibility .
lnstrumentation is malfunctioning .
we can' t get any kind of reading on what' s in front of us .
wait a minute .
it maybe clearing .
pull out !
line' s gone , sir .
two more spotted over the atlantic .
one' s moving toward new york , the other here .
how long do we have ?
less than 10 minutes .
mr president , i recommend we move you to a secure location .
connie , can we expect the same panic ?
more than likely .
we can discuss this on the way .
i' m not leaving .
we have to maintain a working government .
take the vice president , the whole cabinet , and the joint chiefs to a secured location .
i' m staying .
i don' t want to add to a public hysteria that' s gonna cost lives .
connie , we' il initiate the emergency broadcast system .
we' il advise people not to panic .
the best idea right now is to stay in their homes .
yes , sir .
roy ?
dean ?
have the cabinet members rendez vous here .
we' il take them to norad .
mr president , with your permission , i' d like to remain at your side .
i had a feeling you would .
what happens if they do become hostile ?
then god help us .
there it is .
the strange atmospheric phenomenon .
it is apparently what is causing all the distortions ...
david , are you watching this ?
there is no evidence that these phenomena are endangering anyone .
thus far , reports of oppression ...
marty , i got a lock on that signal pattern so we can filter it out .
but if my calculations are right , it' il be gone in seven hours .
it' s reducing itself every time it recycles so eventually it' il disappear .
are you listening ?
can you believe this ?
haven' t you been watching ?
david !
good afternoon .
so far the phenomenon has not caused any damage .
we have to ask you to stay calm , and it' s important for everyone not to panic .
we have a fix on three of the occurrences about to appear ...
it' s just unreal .
miguel , come here !
one is headed towards los angeles .
the other two are headed towards new york and washington , dc .
marty .
jamie says this building has an old bomb shelter .
we' re heading down there now .
everybody !
head down to the basement .
take it slow , don' t run .
walk down to the basement !
there' s no shame in hiding .
i' d better call my mother .
well , look who we have here .
russ , i heard you had a little trouble this morning .
dusted the wrong field .
i know you' re probably still a little confused from your hostage experience .
hostage experience ?
did something happen to you , russ ?
years back he was kidnapped by aliens .
did all kind of experiments on him and such .
tell' em about it , russ .
get a few beers in him and he' il tell you all about it .
won' t you , russ ?
russ , when they took you up in their spaceship , did they do any ... .. sexual things ?
do you recall ?
do you recollect ?
what' s that ?
let' s get outta here .
wow !
mommy , look it !
it' s too early , baby .
ls it an earthquake ?
not even a four pointer .
go back to sleep .
daddy !
what are you doing here ?
you should be in the shelter .
what' s going on ?
aren' t you coming , david ?
i gotta see this .
the signal !
my god !
now what do we do ?
address the nation .
there' s gonna be a lot of frightened people out there .
yeah .
i' m one of ' em .
hey !
come on !
he' s just trying to impress you .
lf you wanna impress me , you need to get a job and stop slobberin ' all over my shoes .
i don' t believe this .
jasmine !
neighbours are movin ' out .
i guess they finally got tired of all these quakes .
a little shake and they runnin ' .
police and fire departments want everyone to stay off the phone .
there' s something on the news about the quake !
what' s up , man ?
what you doin ' goin ' out there ?
shooting aliens .
oh , you shootin ' aliens .
you think you' re tough , huh ?
what you got ?
turn around .
come on , let' s get you something to eat .
watch out !
watch it now !
i' m gonna go grab the paper .
dylan !
come on , honey .
let' s go !
babe , you want some ofthis coffee ?
babe ?
pentagon offilcials are warning more ships have arrived over the capitals of india , englandand germany , bringing estimates up to between 10 and 15 of these city size spacecraft .
i know , ma .
just try and stay calm .
tell her to leave town .
why ?
what happened ?
just do it !
ma , listen !
get your stuff together and head for aunt esther' s .
don' t argue with me !
just go !
david !
why did i just send my mother to atlanta ?
david , talk to me .
the signal in the satellite feed is recycling down to extinction .
didn' t you hear me ?
not really .
countdown .
a countdown ?
to what , david ?
it' s like in chess .
first you strategically position your pieces .
then , when the timing' s right , you strike .
see ?
they' re positioning themselves everywhere using one signal to synchronise their efforts .
ln about six hours , the signal' s gonna disappear and the countdown will be over .
and then what ?
checkmate .
oh , my god !
oh , my god , i gotta call my brother .
i' d better call my housekeeper , and my lawyer !
ah , forget my lawyer .
ladies and gentlemen , the president ofthe united states .
good afternoon .
my fellow americans , a historic and unprecedented event has occurred .
the question of whether or not we' re alone in the universe has been answered .
although it' s understandable that many of us feel hesitation or fear , we must attempt to reserve judgment .
he says he' s your husband .
oh , god .
what do you want ?
you gotta leave the white house .
this is hardly the time to be having that old discussion .
you gotta leave washington .
ln case you haven' t noticed , we are having a little crisis here !
they have a hidden signal .
they' re gonna attack .
you are just being paranoid !
it' s not paranoia !
the embedding' s very subtle .
it was probably overlooked ...
marty , get out oftown as soon as you can .
please ?
the staff and i will remain here as we attempt to communicate .
if you feel compelled to leave these cities , please do so in an orderly fashion .
excuse me !
coming through .
the arrival of the aliens has caused over 10, 000 fender benders in just a few seconds .
but this is just the beginning ...
you can' t go !
you got to call them back !
i' m not gonna do this with you , jasmine .
i' ve got to report to el toro .
you said you was on leave for the fourth !
well , they cancelled it !
look , why are you acting like this ?
why ?
that' s why !
look , i really don' t think they flew 90 billion light years to come and start a fight , and get all rowdy .
why don' t you just relax ?
i' m gonna report to el toro , find out what' s goin ' on .
what are you doin ' in there , man ?
nothing , i' m just drivin ' .
look .
i got these for you .
firecrackers !
you be careful .
steve , wait .
i wanna tell you something .
what is it , jasmine ?
you take care of yourself , you hear ?
look , why don' t you pack some things and you and dylan come stay with me on the base ?
you will see that there is nothing to be scared of .
really ?
you don' t mind ?
well , i mean ...
i will have to let all my other girlfriends know they can' t come over .
i got to postpone a freaky weekend .
there you go , thinking you' re all that .
but you are not as charming as you think you are , sir .
yes , i am .
them big old dumbo ears .
look at you with them chicken legs .
come on , dylan .
look out !
the television said they started looting .
vultures .
do you still have the plymouth ?
david , you don' t have a licence .
you' re driving .
yeah , i' m ...
i' m driving ?
come on .
i really want you out of los angeles .
you' re staying there to keep people calm .
i won' t let them criticise you for it .
i appreciate your trying to help me .
liar .
stick to the truth .
you' re good at it .
ok .
i don' t want you in any one ofthose cities .
i' il leave as soon as the interviews are done .
all right .
a helicopter will be taking you to nullius .
and the munchkin ?
she' il meet you there .
all right .
i love you .
i love you .
bye .
bye .
it ' s the white house !
you can' t drive up and ring a bell .
can' t you go any faster ?
you think they don' t know what you know ?
she works for the president .
they know everything .
they don' t know this .
you' re gonna educate them , huh ?
so are you so smart ?
how come you spent eight years in mlt to become a cable repairman ?
all i' m saying is they got people who handle these things .
if they want hbo , they' il call you .
look at these people , look .
vultures .
they take and then they go .
they' re going faster than we are .
we' re in the fast lane !
they' re cutting me off .
no one' s cutting you off !
they' re getting in front .
i can' t go faster .
i don' t wanna argue .
let' s just get there , quickly .
what' s the rush ?
you think we' il get to washington and it won' t be there ?
a crop duster was arrested as he dropped leaflets from the air .
everybody' s leavin ' .
can you give us some ofyour time ?
we' ve got to stop them ! i was kidnapped by space aliens ten years ago !
they did all kinds of experiments on me !
they' ve been studying us , finding out our weaknesses !
we' ve gotta stop ' em .
they' re gonna kill us all !
some people attribute his behaviour to post traumatic stress from his service as a pilotin vietnam .
others have a more unusual theory .
how would you describe mr casse ?
keeps to himself .
quiet .
private .
when they took him up in the spaceship , the aliens abused him sexually .
mr casse is in the county lockup ...
pack up .
we' re leaving .
he maybe released later tonight ...
miguel , what about dad ?
this could be our last night on earth .
you don' t wanna die a virgin , do you ?

you' re just the man who married my mother .
you' re nothin ' to me !
well , what about troy ?
troy ?
yeah .
for once in your life , why don' t you think about what' s best for him ?
who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up ?
huh ?

you stop it right now !
i' m not a baby any more !
i don' t want your stupid medicine because i' m so sick of medicine !
do you know what this stuff costs ?
do you wanna get sick again ?
do you ?
the lapd is asking los angelenos not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft .
you may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war .
do you think we can find something better to do with our time ?
where you been , stevie ?
man , this is unbelievable .
this is , like , huge .
they' ve recalled everybody .
looks like the mail' s still working .
you' il have to do the honours for me .
you' re a wuss !

captain steven hiller " ... loser .

blah blah blah !
we regret to inform you that despite your excellent record of service ...
i' m sorry , man .
you know what you need to do ?
you need to , like , kiss some serious booty to get ahead in this world .

oh , like the really bad feeling you got when i went to las vegas ?
and i was right .
you didn' t get the job and you lost all your money gambling .

nice workin ' with you , mario .
come on , boomer .
everyone is trying to get out of washington .
we' re the only schmucks trying to get in .
what the hell' s that ?
part of any phone books of amerikans .
you think a important person like constance are in listing ?
she always keeps her portable phone listed for emergencies .
sometimes it' s her first initial , sometimes her nickname .
sometimes just her ...
oy , my god !
hey , hey , hey !
slow down !
pit stops !
tell them !
slow down !
a ramp !
slow down !
we made it !
good .
nice drivin ' , pops .
well ...
so , not listed , huh ?
no , no .
i just haven' t found it yet .
i tried c. spano , connie spano , spunky spano .
spunky ?
college nickname .
cute .
you tried levinson ?
she didn' t take my name .
why would she ...
what do you mean ?
try it .
here .
look .
so what do i know ?
hm ?
so ?
do you wanna ring the bell , or should i ?
perfect , she' s using it .
what ?
it' s busy ?
yeah , i can use her signal to triangulate her exact position in the white house .
you can do that ?
yeah .
all cable repairmen can , pops .
the visitors have arrived , but the president remains at the white house .
question .
are mr whitmore' s actions a ) ultra brave or b ) foolhardy ?
what ?
don' t hang up , sweetie .
david !
how did you get this number ?
do me a favour .
walk to the window .
and i' m looking for what ?
you' il see .
over here .
see us ?
how does he do that ?
ln light of our apparent inability to communicate with the visitors
pentagon officials have retrofit this skylift helicopter with a visual communications device .
mr president .
gentlemen , be seated .
where are we now ?
we' re commencing lift off . .. and refitted with these enormous light panels that are attached to the hull and onto the sides .
echo one , welcome wagon is in the air .
i repeat , welcome wagon is in the air .
roger , welcome wagon .
echo one , right beside you .
this is something i would never believe that i would be !
in the white house !
if i knew i was gonna meet the president , i would have worn a tie .
look at me , i look like a schlemiel .
oy , my god !
david ,
i don' t know if he' il want to see you .
then we' re wasting time , we should go .
why wouldn' t he listen ?
last time i saw him , we had a fight .
you walked in and punched him in the head .
the president !
he wasn' t president then .
i punched him , he fought back .
it was a fight !
a fight that you started !
david thought i was having an affair .
with the president ?
which i wasn' t !
either go get him , or we should head back .
all right , i' il get him .
wait here , and don' t touch anything !
you punched the president ?
god !
nearing point of contact , echo one .
we' re closing in .
roger that .
begin sequence when ready .
this i like .
look at this !
you know what famous people have been here ?
hm ?
politicians , actors , baseball players , singers ...
and now me !
imagine that !
a poor immigrant like me .
" it' s a dream !
sh !
david !
the three choppers are approaching what has been unanimously agreed to be the front ofthese spaceships ...
you' re leaving now ?
hey , see if they' ve got those pens they give away .
dad , what ?
i don' t have a choice ...
i don' t have time for this .
two minutes , tom , please .
mr president , julius levinson .
david is my ...
i told you he wouldn' t listen .
you have to tell him now .
david , you have to tell him !
david , tell him !
i know why we have satellite disruption .
all right .
go ahead .
let' s say that you wanted to coordinate with spaceships on different sides ofthe earth .
they couldn' t send a direct signal , right ?
you mean line of sight ?
right .
the curve of the earth prevents it .
you' d need satellites to relay that signal in order to reach each ship .
well , i found a signal hidden inside our own satellite system .
excuse me , mr president .
they' re starting .
they' re using our own satellites against us .
the clock is ticking .
bringing it in to hover .
welcome wagon ,
echo one .
approaching alien ship .
initiating communication sequence .
welcome wagon has commenced .
general grey , coordinate with the atlantic command .
tell them to evacuate the cities .
get those helicopters away from the ship .
call them back !
what the hell' s going on ?
we' re leaving .
kim !
my daughter .
something' s happening .
they' re responding .
it looks like there' s activity .
this may be a response , echo one .
we see it too .
can' t identify it .
we are evacuating .
i repeat , we are evacuating the white house .
load the rest of the staff in the second helicopter .
is my wife in the air ?
she will be shortly .
nice .
very nice .
good !
close the door !
hatch secure !
we have our own phone .
move outta here .
the president' s ordered an evacuation .
our prayers go out to the pilots ' families .
indeed , god help us all .
mrs whitmore .
the visitors responded with terrifying ...
authorities have called for the evacuation of los angeles county .
people are advised to avoid the highways wherever possible .
great !
now he tells me .
this is the los angeles police department .
please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety .
can we move it along ?
dr katz' s offilce .
hello .
dr katz , please .
i' m sorry , he' s not available .
for $300 an hour , you can put me through to his house in the hamptons !
this is the los angeles police department .
please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety .
mrs whitmore !
you must leave now .
the first lady' s secured .
we' re on the move .
they' re opening up !
it' s so pretty .

we' re gonna be all right , troy .
yeah , leave me alone .
i got it .
miguel !
look at all that .
we could have evacuated the cities hours ago .
that' s the advantage of being a fighter pilot .
ln the gulf war , we knew what we had to do .
this is just ... .. not simple any more .
a lot of people died today .
how many didn' t have to ?
any news on my wife yet ?
the helicopter never made it to nullius .
no radio contact .
come on , dylan .
stay close .
here it is .
what happened , mommy ?
i don' t know , baby .
you men will be the first wave in our counter attack .
our target is to the north , centred above what remains of downtown los angeles .
our black knight squadron ...
are you scared , man ?
nope .
you ?
nope .
hold me !
hey , pay attention .
something you wanna add , captain hiller ?
no , sir .
just a little anxious to whup et' s ass , that' s all .
you' il get your chance .
you' il all get your chance .

i' m all ears , brother !
you the man !
all right , gentlemen , we' re on .
general , it' s norad .
general grey here .
al ?
all communications with the cities are down .
all systems gone .
for intelligence , we believe it' s a total loss .
how about our boys ?
where are they ?
eta to target , four minutes .
i shouldn' t have left her .
don' t worry about it , big man .
i' m sure she got outta here before it happened .
why we' re on this particular mission , we' il never know .
but i do know , here today , that the black knights will emerge victorious once again .
amen , man !
amen , reverend .
holy god !
lock and load !
roger that .
la attack squadron has amraam missiles locked on target .
washington and new york squadrons report lock on .
fire at will .
fire at will .
knights , we are red and free .
knight one , fox three !
knight three , fox three !
knight seven , fox three .
the missiles have been fired .

they' re dropping like flies .
we' re losing it .

we' il have to make a run for this one !
let' s get low and fast !
i gotcha , big daddy !
let' s get ' em !
watch the deck !
squadron leader , abort !
this isn' t happening fast enough !
get ' em out !

where' s the picture ?
we' ve lost the satellite .
we got two on our six , jimmy .
shackle !
roger .
come on , come on !
move !
you told me , like , quite all right !
they ain' t got nothin ' for us !
let' s push it !
i can' t shake ' em .
yes , you can .
just the way i showed you .
i' m gonna try somethin ' .
nothin ' stupid !
you know me !
that' s what i mean .
jimmy , you can' t bank at that speed !
jimmy , he' s closing on you !
put your mask back on !
that' s an order !
i can' t breathe !
jimmy !
no !
affirmative .
we have incoming .
let me have it , son .

friendly ?
sergeant ?
i don' t think so .
come on and get me !
what are you shooting at ?
where you at , baby ? !
come on !
you can' t hit nothin ' !
low bridge !
see if you can fly that thing under cover !
hope you got an airbag !
son of a bitch !
this way !
this way !
get off !
get off of me !
that' s what you' il get !
look at you !
ship all banged up !
who' s the man ? !
huh ?
who' s the man ? !
wait till i get another plane !
i' m linin ' all your friends up , right beside you !
where you at ?
huh ?
where you at ?
welcome to earth .
that' s what i call close contact .
baby , stay right here with boomer .
keys .
come on , keys .
yes !
come , baby .
come on !
reports indicate that this battle has repeated itself all over the world with the same results .
you' re just like your mother , you know that ?
she was stubborn , too .
i had to twist her arm to get her to take her medicine .
you' re gonna be all right .
you' re gonna be fine .
see , troy ?
you' re feelin ' better already .
i couldn' t find anything .
everyone' s packin ' up .
they said a spaceship is headed this way .
we' d better leave , too , then .
everyone' s packin ' up .
penicillin .
it' il help keep his fever down .
thank you .
it' s really nice of you to help us .
i wish i could do more , but we' re moving out .
i' m going with you .
well , i just mean that we' re going , too .
cool .
tell that punk to shut the door , we' re outta here .
he can sniff around somewhere else .
it' s air force one , for crying out loud .
still he gets sick .
i don' t feel too good .
look at me , huh ?
like a rock .
could be bad weather or good weather .
we could go up or down , back or forwards , side to side ...
what did i say ?
he still gets airsick , huh ?
yeah .
julius , with all of this ...
i didn' t get a chance to thank you two .
all he could think of was getting to you .
there' s still love there , i think .
love was never a problem .
all you need is love .
john lennon .
smart man .
shot in the back , very sad .
we' ve moved as many of our forces away from our bases as possible .
but we' ve already sustained heavy losses .
i spoke with the joint chiefs at norad .
they agree we must counterattack with a full nuclear strike .
over american soil ?
you' re saying we should sacrifice more innocent american civilians ?
if we don' t strike soon , there may not be much of an america left !
sir !
they' ve taken out norad .
what ?
it' s gone , sir .
my god !
the vice president ?
the joint chiefs ?
mr president .
we must launch .
a delay would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities .
you' re not gonna launch nuclear weapons .
you' il kill them and us .
if we fire nukes ...
sir , may i remind you you are a guest here ?
you ever hear of nuclear winter ?
it' s the end of life as we know it .
just go .
i don' t have to go .
it can' t be allowed !
shut up !
captain , get him out !
don' t tell him to shut up !
you' d all be dead if it wasn' t for my david !
none of you did anything to prevent this !
there was nothing we could do .
we were totally unprepared for this .
don' t give me that !
come on .
it was , what ?
ln the 1950s , you had that spaceship .
dad .
look ...
yeah , that thing you found in new mexico !
where was that ?
not the spaceship .
roswell , new mexico .
you had the spaceship and the bodies !
they were locked up in a bunker .
where was that ?
david !
area 51 .
right ?
area 51 .
you knew then !
and you did nothing .
sir .
regardless of what you may have read in the tabloids , there have never been any spacecraft recovered by our government .
take my word for it .
there' s no area 51 .
and there' s no recovered spaceship .
excuse me , mr president ...
that' s not entirely accurate .
hold on , everybody .
hold on !
sorry .
the end hath come !
he' s spaken his word and the end hath come !
hop on !
we' re headin ' out to el toro !
you cannot defy what hath come !
it' s the end !
el toro ? !
can you give me a hand ?
sure .
oh , god .
ok , let' s get this off .
here , let me help you .
she' s hurt pretty badly .
you know , this was supposed to be my weekend off .
but , nooo !
you got me out here , draggin ' your heavy ass through the burnin ' desert with your dreadlocks stickin ' out the back of my parachute .
you gotta come down here with an attitude , actin ' all big and bad .
and what the hell is that smell ?
i coulda been at a barbecue !
but i ain' t mad .
it' s all right , it' s all right .
do you need a lift , soldier ?
when i flew overhead , i saw a base not too far from here .
it ain' t on the map .
trust me , it' s there .
attention !
mr president .
general .
welcome to area 51 .
please follow me .
we' re now 24 floors beneath the surface and here' s our main research facility .
let' s see it .
sorry , sir , it' s a clean room .
it' s static free ...
open the door .
yes , sir .
my god .
why the hell wasn' t i told about this place ?
two words , mr president .
plausible deniability .
i don' t get it .
where does all this come from ?
how do you get funding for something like this ?
you don' t actually think they spend $20, 000 on a hammer , $30, 000 on a toilet seat , do you ?
mr president , this is dr okun .
he has headed up the research department on this project for the last 15 years .
how do you do ?
mr president !
wow !
this ...
what a pleasure !
as you can imagine , they ...
they don' t let us out much .
i can understand that .
well !
i guess you' d like to see the big tamale , huh ?
follow me .
she' s a beaut , ain' t she ?
as you can see from the repairs , we' ve been trying to put her back together since the ' 60s .
you' ve had this for 40 years and you know nothing about ' em ?
oh , hell , no .
we know tons about ' em .
but the neatest stuff ...
the neatest stuff has only happened in the last few days .
we can' t duplicate their type of power so we' ve never been able to experiment .
but since these guys started showing up , all the little gizmos inside turned on .
the last 24 hours have been really exciting !
exciting ?
people are dying out there .
exciting isn' t the word i' d choose to describe it !
you' re hoping to fly this thing , huh ?
you said you can repair their technology .
can you tell us anything useful about them ?
yeah .
well , i mean ...
they' re not all that dissimilar from us .
breathes oxygen , comparable tolerances to heat , cold .
probably why they' re interested in our planet .
hey ...
you guys wanna see ' em ?
this is ...
this is the vault .
or , as some of us have come to call it ... .. the freak show .
when we found ' em , they were wearing some sort of biomechanical suits .
once we got ' em off , we learned a great deal about their anatomy .
eyes , ears .
no vocal chords .
we assume they communicate with each other by some other means .
you' re obviously not thinking about hand signals and body language .
it' s some kind of extrasensory perception .
telepathy .
so ...
it' s an organic life form .
can they be killed ?
their bodies are just as frail as ours .
these two died in the crash .
this one a few weeks later .
you just have to get through their technology , which is ,
i' m sorry to say , far more advanced .
david , you unlocked part of their technology .
you cracked the code .
no , no .
all i did was stumble on their ... .. signal .
i don' t know how helpful i can be .
why don' t you show him what you' ve discovered so far ?
figure out what they haven' t thought of yet .
we' il see if you' re as smart as we all hope you are .
what code ?
captain steven hiller , us marine corps .
i' m sorry , captain .
you don' t have clearance .
ok .
come here .
you wanna see my clearance ?
maybe i' il just leave this here with you .
let ' em pass .
get the hell out of the way !
did you see that ?
come on down .
watch your step .
well , obviously this cockpit was designed to seat three .
though how they sat on them , i don' t know .
gently .
you see these gizmos flashing ?
we' ve been workin ' around the clock trying to get a fix on all this .
some stuff we figured out right away .
this we' re pretty sure is the life support for the cabin .
and this doohickey is connected to ...
oh ...
well , it was connected to the engine .
here , take that , will ya ?
these configurations ...
well , to be honest , we don' t know what the hell this crap is .
but this is clearly what they use to guide and navigate their craft .
neat , huh ?
could somebody grab my laptop there ?
can i have the computer inside ?
these patterns are repeating sequentially , like their countdown signal .
they' re using that frequency for computer communications .
see ?
that' s how they' re coordinating their ships .
you know ...
you' re really starting to make us look bad .
they got one !
they got one alive !
they got one .
alive !
jesus !
you' il be ok by yourself , dave ?
fine .
don' t touch anything .
everybody' s always telling me not to touch anything .
oh !
it' s all wet .
right here !
in the back of the pickup .
general , sir .
captain steven hiller , united states marine corps .
guess who' s comin ' to dinner !
i need a doctor .
i need a doctor !
oh , boy !
how long has he been unconscious ?
about three hours .
let' s get him in containment .
my son is very sick .
he needs attention !
he' s drying out .
i want him sprayed down with saline .
he has a problem with his adrenal cortex !
please !
if you don' t do something right now , my son will die !
just help him !
okay .
o' haver , miller , you come with us .
you , take us to him , ok ?
let' s go .
all right .
move it !
as the former head of the cla , you knew about this place .
when were you planning to inform us ?
it had been deemed classified .
you should have told us about this when they first arrived !
we wouldn' t have launched a counterattack that cost the lives of hundreds of our pilots !
we could not have known that our fighters would' ve been that ineffective !
mr president .
the little bit of information we have comes directly into this room .
atlanta , chicago , and philadelphia .
destroyed .
nato and western allied installations were the first to be taken out .
then we were hit .
they knew exactly where and how to hit us .
and our forces ?
we' re down to 15 % .
if you calculate the time it takes to destroy a city and move on , we' re looking at the worldwide destruction of every major city in the next 36 hours .
we' re being exterminated .
mr president !
this is captain steven hiller .
captain .
mr president .
well done .
where is it now ?
it' s isolated in the containment lab , sir .
i' d like to go see it .
general , i' m really anxious to get back to el toro .
hasn' t anyone told you ?
el toro has been completely destroyed .
we were lucky .
today was the first time i used the subway .
thank god for the metro rail .
these should last us a while .
don' t move .
i' il get it for you .
stay still .
he' s your son ?
he' s my angel .
was his father stationed here ?
nah , he ...
he wasn' t his father .
but i was kinda hopin ' he wanted the job , though .
so what do you do for a living ?
i' m a dancer .
ballet .
no .
exotic .
sorry .
don' t be .
i' m not .
it' s good money .
besides my baby' s worth it .
dylan !
come here .
i want you to meet the first lady .
hello .
hi .
i didn' t know that you' d recognised me .
well , i didn' t want to say nothin ' .
i voted for the other guy .
life support monitors recording .
so if we screw up , it' s all on tape .
come on .
let' s get this biomechanical suit off .
put the spreader right here , along the ridge .
microprobe thing a majig goes right here .
pick there .
good .
all right , now spread it very , very gently .
let me get in .
gentle , gentle , that' s it .
run this right in ...
all right .
let' s proceed .
now comes the really icky part .
oh , boy .
this is one smelly , disgusting ...
look at it .
it doesn' t look alive , does it ?
the arm is moving .
doctor ?
doctor ?
doctor ?
don' t move !
dr okun ?
release me .
open the door .
get him out !
no , wait .
release me .
i know there is much we can learn from each other if we can negotiate a truce .
we can find a way to coexist .
can there be a peace between us ?
peace .
no peace .
what is it you want us to do ?
die .
die !
mr president .
is that glass bulletproof ?
no , sir .
are you all right ?
i saw his thoughts .
i saw what they' re planning to do .
they' re like locusts .
they' re moving from planet to planet .
their whole civilisation .
after they' ve consumed every natural resource , they move on .
and we' re next .
nuke ' em .
let' s nuke the bastards .
just my luck .
no ice .
i take it you' ve heard ?
hey , toast .
to the end of the world .
he didn' t come to this decision lightly .
he didn' t have any other choice .
well , you still believe in him .
well , he' s a good man .
he' d better be .
you left me for him .
or , you know ... for your career .
you know , it wasn' t just my career .
it was the biggest opportunity of my life .
i wanted my life to make a difference .
i wanted my life to mean something .
and ...
i wasn' t ... ambitious enough for you ?
david , you could have done anything you wanted .
research , development ...
i was happy where i was .
haven' t you ever wanted to be part of something special ?
i was part of something special .
well , if it makes any difference , i never stopped loving you .
but that wasn' t enough , was it ?
let' s pick it up , man .
let' s go !
let' s pick it up , man !
we' re on a tight schedule !
pick it up , man !
pick it up !
what the hell are you doin ' ?
get outta there !
i got something i gotta handle .
i' m borrowin ' it .
no , you' re not , sir .
do you really wanna shoot me ?
just tell ' em i hit you .
command , this is retal op.
squadron is in the air .
we are on station and awaiting instructions .
break formation .
head to targets .
sir .
they' re breaking formation .
we' re initiating sequence code .
alpha zulu six eight niner .
which city will be reached first ?
houston , texas .
eta , six minutes and counting down .
houston .
the major cities have been deserted .
civilian casualties should be down to a minimum .
command , this is neighbourhood watch .
we are in position .
tracking monitors are locked on .
we are going to visual recon .
roger .
we have confirmation .
launch code confirmed .
alpha zulu six eight niner , standing by .
laser targeting .
locked on .
we' re locked on , sir .
do you wish to deploy ?
mr president , if you wish to deploy , the time is now .
mr president ?
deploy .
that' s a go .
alpha zulu six eight niner .
here we go .
bird' s away .
we have visual confirmation of the missile .
it' s on target .
approaching .
may our children forgive us .
five seconds to impact .
three , two , one .
it' s a hit !
get down !
get down !
can we confirm that the target was destroyed ?
get the tank commander .
confirm the target was destroyed .
red arrow , alpha 9723 .
can you read ?
repeat .
you' re breaking up .
we have lost visual .
roger that .
we' re looking for confirmation .
we got the bastards .
good job , everyone !
congratulations .
commander , do you have visual ?
we need visual confirmation .
has the target been destroyed ?
negative .
target remains .
i repeat , target remains .
call the other planes back .
the others might have more luck .
we shouldn' t give up !
i said call them back !
abort .
abort mission .
lssue the abort codes right away .
this is an abort , full abort .
do you read ?
jasmine !
you' re late !
you know i like to make an entrance .
where are we going ?
through there , sir .
mr president .
your wife is resting comfortably for the moment .
perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier ...
hey , there she is !
go on !
she doesn' t look too good .
your wife is bleeding internally .
perhaps if we' d gotten to her earlier ...
what are you saying ?
we can' t stop the bleeding .
lf we' d ...
there' s nothing we can do for her .
we were worried .
we didn' t know where you were .
you' ve gotten bigger , i think .
i did ?
you just keep growing and growing .
i can' t ...
hey .
can you wait outside for a little bit so mom can get a rest ?
come on , munchkin .
i' m so sorry that i didn' t come home when you asked me to .
it' s ok .
the doctors ... .. think that you' re ... gonna be just fine .
liar .
ls mommy sleeping now ?
yeah .
mommy' s sleeping .
david !
what the hell are you doing ?
i' m makin ' a mess !
yeah .
this i can see .
we gotta burn this toxic waste , pollute the air and rip up the ozone !
cos maybe if we screw this planet up enough ... .. they won' t want it any more .
wait .
david .
don' t do this to yourself .
listen to me .
i' m listening .
everyone loses faith at some point in their life .
even myself .
i haven' t spoken to god since your mother died .
you see , sometimes we have to remember what we still have .
like what ?
well , you still have your health .
david , you need your rest .
come on !
get off this freezing floor before you catch cold .
come on !
what did you just say ?
about faith ?
well , you see , a man ...
no .
the other part .
what ?
i don' t want you to catch cold .
what is that ?
what is the matter with you ?
genius .
genius ?
my dad .
a total genius .
jerry , wake up .
we got work to do .
get everybody down here right away .
look at that !
wow !
does that thing really fly in outer space ?
it most certainly does .
sure doesn' t look like it .
they' re here .
all right , what' s this all about ?
i have no idea .
get everybody off .
right , clear the platform .
let' s go .
major mitchell .
do you have a pistol ?
what ?
have you got a gun ?
sergeant , your sidearm .
see that coke can on top of the alien craft ?
think you can shoot that thing off ?
shoot it .
sir ?
go ahead .
what the hell are you doing ?
i' m sorry .
my fault .
that coke can was protected by the craft' s shield .
we can' t penetrate it .
what' s your point ?
my point is , if we can' t beat their defences , then we gotta get around them .
major .
one more time ...
any time .
how did you do that ?
i gave it a cold .
i gave it a virus .
a computer virus .
are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields ?
just like they used our satellites against us , we can use their own signal against them .
lf we plant a virus into that mother ship , it' s gonna filter down into all the corresponding ships below .
i' m sorry .
i don' t understand .
how exactly do we infect the mother ship with this virus ?
we' re ...
we' re gonna have to ... fly their alien craft out of our atmosphere and dock with it .
we can enter here , as shown in these satellite photos .
we then upload the virus , set off some kind of explosion which' il disable it .
that' il disorient the smaller ships below and that could buy you some time to ... to take ' em ... take ' em out .
take ' em down .
do your ...
do your stuff .
this is ridiculous !
how long would their shields be down ?
eh ...
i dunno .
a matter of minutes .
you want us to coordinate a counterstrike with a window of a few minutes ?
with shields down , it might be possible .
oh , please !
we don' t have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign !
not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan depends on a machine that no one in this world is qualified to operate .
i wouldn' t say that , sir .
i' ve seen them in action .
i' m aware of their manoeuvring capabilities .
with your permission , general , i' d like the opportunity to try .
that thing is a wreck .
it crash landed in the ' 50s .
we don' t even know if it' s capable of flying !
jim , remove the clamps .
any questions ?
let' s do it .
all right , you heard the president ...
good luck , pilot .
thank you , mr president .
a virus .
your idea .
that' s right .
do you really think you can fly that thing ?
do you really think you can do all that bullshit you just said ?
i understand you are upset over your wife' s death .
but that' s no excuse for making another fatal mistake .
no , my mistake was to appoint a snivelling weasel like you as secretary of defense .
you don' t understand !
however , that is one mistake i am thankful to say that i don' t have to live with .
mr president ...
mr nimsiki , you' re fired .
let' s organise every plane we can find and get us some goddamn pilots to fly ' em .
yes , sir .
he can' t do that .
well , he just did .
command has attempted to list casualties and losses , but information is sketchy .
we know they' ve lost the belgian contingent in the sinai .
there' s a strong possibility reinforcements are hiding in the golan straits .
what is he saying ?
they' re getting a signal .
old morse code .
it' s from the americans .
they want to organise a counteroffensive !
it' s about bloody time !
what do they plan to do ?
we have confirmed reports of combat ready divisions
in europe , the middle east , and asia .
impressive .
considering it' s all done with ...
morse code .
the armed forces here ?
we have sufficient aircraft , but ...
but what ?
pilots are comin ' up short .
well , then , find ' em .
ham radio operators from new york to japan trade rumours of military forces in hiding , unwilling to reveal themselves for fear of annihilation ...
we' re planning to launch a counter offensive .
with our depleted manpower , we' re asking that anyone with flight experience come forward .
military training is preferable , but anyone who can fly would be useful .
i can fly .
i' m a pilot .
all right , guys !
listen up !
pay attention .
these f 18s are very different than the jets you piloted .
it' s strong .
forgive the expression , but this is a crash course in modern avionics .
keep it comin ' .
ok , you got it !
all right , listen up .
first we need some background information on your experience .
let' s start with you .
who , me ?
well , i' m russell casse , sir .
and after ' nam i got into crop dusting .
and been doing that ever since .
on a personal note , sir , i' d just like to add that ever since i was kidnapped by aliens 10 years ago ,
i have been dyin ' for some payback .
i just want you to know that i won' t let you down .
you have one tactical nuclear missile we' re loading into this launcher under the right wing .
this is the firing mechanism .
it' il be attached to the ship' s main console .
just like the amraam launch pad on a stealth .
except the nuke will not detonate at impact .
you' il have 30 seconds to get your asses out ofthere .
good luck , gentlemen .
30 seconds .
it' s the strongest radio transmitter we had .
it' il tell us when you' ve uploaded the virus .
30 seconds .
don' t you think that' s cutting it too close ?
we' re gonna be well on our way back home before we shoot that thing off .
why you ?
david !
i don' t understand why you can' t show someone else how to plant the virus .
no .
something may go wrong .
i may have to think quickly , adjust the signal .
who knows ?
hey , you know how i' m always trying to save the planet ?
here' s my chance .
now he gets ambitious .
it' s too tight .
well , i had to borrow it .
let me see .
ok .
all right , i guess that' s good enough .
so .
how do i look ?
oh , thank you .
you' re a lot of help .
you' re late !
well , you know me .
i know .
you like to make a big entrance .
listen .
before we do this , i just wanna say i' m sorry .
sorry for what , babe ?
i should have done this a long time ago .
do you have the ring ?
yes , sir .
here , make yourself useful .
witnesses ?
we got hung up .
well , let' s get this show on the road .
dearly beloved , we' re gathered here in the sight of god and in the presence of these witnesses to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony .
any person who can show good cause why these two should not wed , please speak now or for ever hold your peace .
steve , will you take this woman to be your wedded wife , to live together with her in the holy state of matrimony ?
will you love her , comfort her , honour and keep her in sickness and in health , and , forsaking all others , keep yourself only for her as long as you both shall live ?
i will .
good morning .
they' re a little young .
that they are .
they look a little nervous .
i need all flight crews to report to their designated areas .
major .
can i borrow that ?
sir .
good morning .
good morning .
in less than an hour , aircraft from here will join others from around the world .
and you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind .
mankind .
that word should have new meaning for all of us today .
we can' t be consumed by our petty differences any more .
we will be united in our common interest .
perhaps it' s fate that today is the fourth of july .
and you will once again be fighting for our freedom .
not from tyranny , oppression or persecution .
but from annihilation .
we' re fighting for our right to live .
to exist .
and should we win the day , the fourth of july will no longer be known as an american holiday , but as the day when the world declared in one voice ,
we will not go quietly into the night !
we will not vanish without a fight !
we' re going to live on !
we' re going to survive !
today , we celebrate our independence day !
let' s go !
