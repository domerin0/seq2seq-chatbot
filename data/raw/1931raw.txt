' they will say that i have shed innocent blood .
' what' s blood for if not for shedding ?
' with my hook for a hand
' i' il split you from your groin to your gullet .
' i came for you . '
this is the scariest story i' ve ever heard and it' s totally true .
' it happened a few years ago near moses lake in lndiana .
' clara was baby sitting for the johnsons
' and billy pulls up on his motorcycle .
' she wasn' t even going out with billy .
' she was going out with michael for about six months
' but she always kind of had the hots for billy
' because he was like a bad boy
' and michael was ... he was just so nice .
' so anyway , she decides that tonight' s the night
' that she' s going to give billy what she never gave to michael . '
have you ever heard of candyman ?
no .
his right hand is sawn off .
he has a hook jammed in the bloody stump and if you look in the mirror and you say his name five times he' il appear behind you , breathing down your neck .
you want to try it ?
' so billy began .
' he looked in the mirror , and he said ... '
candyman ...
candyman ...
candyman ...
candyman ...
no one ever got past four .
not here .
go downstairs .
i have a surprise for you .
' she looked in the mirror
' and i don' t know why
' but she said his name the last time . '
candyman .
' she turned out the lights ... '
... and what he saw turned his hair white from shock .
killed her .
split her open with his hook and then killed the baby too .
and billy got away but soon after , he went crazy .
my ... my roommate' s boyfriend knows him .
so when did you first hear this story ?
my friend heard it on the radio .
it' s true .
sick , huh ?
the baby sitter just roasted the kid like it was a turkey or something .
so , what' s the deal ?
you guys doing a page on serial killers ?
something like that .
well , that' s it .
we' re done .
thanks .
no problem .
see you .
see you .
see you .
seems like they' re getting younger every day .
does anybody remember the craze for the pet baby alligators ?
when they got too large to keep people flushed them down the toilet .
they live in the sewers .
some or them are 30 feet long .
where did this happen ?
in miami .
they went blind and albino from living in the dark .
it wasn' t miami .
it was new york .
i read it in the paper .
then it must be true .
why would danny and diane both be suffering from the same delusion in two cities over 1 , 000 miles apart ?
let' s face it , folks .
there are no alligators in the sewers .
no , it' s ... it' s round the campfire .
it' s bedtime stories .
see , these stories are ... modern oral folklore .
they are the unselfconscious reflection of the fears of urban society .
that' s lunch .
like the primordial reptile it' s formed into a monster .
why ?
ouch !
oh ...
the dashing professor .
the lovely wife .
helen , you know everybody ?
crme de la crme ...
harold , diane , danny , stacey .
hi .
hello .
so , keep up the good work .
thank you for your contributions .
thanks .
bye .
awesome lecture .
bye .
see ya .
so , you want to tell me about this girl ?
what' s her name ?
stacey .
she could barely look me in the eyes , trevor and she was blushing .
well , i guess it' s because she' s madly in love with me .
all those bursting adolescent hormones .
you don' t really think ...
no , of course not .
good .
i should hope not .
so , what' s the matter ?
trevor , you promised you wouldn' t do the urban legends lecture until next semester .
you knew bernadette and i were gathering data .
why did you have to ruin it ?
i love you dearly but i can' t hold up their education while the two of you complete your thesis .
i have a curriculum to follow here .
yes , i know .
well ... so don' t be mad at me .
' lf you look in the mirror and say his name five times
' he' il appear behind you , breathing down your neck . '
can i clean your room ?
oh , sure .
don' t mind me .
' so billy began .
' he looked in the mirror
' and he said , " candyman , candyman , candyman ... " '
candyman , huh ?
yes .
have you heard of him ?
you doing a study on him ?
yes , i am .
what have you heard ?
everybody scared of him once it get dark .
he live over at cabrini .
my friend told me about him .
cabrini green ?
yeah , in the projects .
i live on the south side so i don' t know much about it .
but my friend know all about it .
her cousin live at cabrini .
they say he killed a lady .
can i talk to your friend ?
sure .
kitty ?
yeah , what do you want ?
lady down here want to talk to you .
all right .
she coming .
i' m helen lyle .
pleased to meet you .
henrietta mosely .
and this is kitty culver .
tell her what you told me about the candyman .
all i know is there was some lady in a tub , and she heard a noise .
do you remember her name ?
her name was ruthie jean .
she heard banging and smashing like somebody was making a hole in the wall .
so ruthie called 91 1 .
she said , " somebody is coming through the wall .
and they didn' t believe her .
they thought the lady was crazy , right ?
so she called 91 1 again and they still didn' t believe her .
when they finally got there , she was dead .
was she shot ?
no .
she was killed with a hook .
schhht !
it' s true .
yeah , i read it in the papers .
candyman killed her .
yeah , but ...
i don' t know nothing about that .
helen , this is sick .
this isn' t one of your fairy tales .
the woman got killed here .
that' s not the half of it .
that' s cabrini green not that you' d recognise it today .
yeah , no kidding .
i won' t even drive past there .
a kid got shot there the other day .
everyday .
ok , now look carefully at this picture and then this one .
you spot it ?
no .
that' s not cabrini green .
that' s this building , lincoln village .
my apartment was built as a housing project .
no .
yeah .
now take a look at this .
once finished the city realised there was no barrier between here and the gold coast .
unlike over there where the highway and the el train keep the ghetto cut off .
so they made some minor alterations .
they covered the cinder block in plaster and sold the lot off as condos .
how much did you pay for this place ?
don' t ask .
now , wait till you see this .
here' s the proof .
the killer , or killers ... they don' t know which ... smashed their way through the back of this cabinet .
see ?
there' s no wall there .
there' s only a medicine chest separating us from the other apartment .
hey , hey , what are you doing ?
there could be somebody on the toilet .
no , the apartment is vacant .
are you sure ?
there .
ok , now take a look .
that is amazing .
what ?
there' s somebody there .
i saw a light .
there' s nobody there .
psych .
that' s not funny .
you didn' t scare me at all .
yeah , right .
ow .
you don' t believe all that nonsense , do you ?
i don' t .
do you ?
no .
all right .
candyman , candyman , candyman , candyman ... ... candyman .
oh , you chicken !
you have to do it five times .
come on .
i did it .
better safe than sorry .
trevor ?
no , no !
what' s the matter ?
oh , trevor !
who were you expecting ?
what time is it ?
it' s late and i' m smashed .
sorry i scared you .
what' s with the arsenal , bernadette ?
we' re only going eight blocks .
you' re the one who got us dressed up like cops .
i just said dress conservatively .
we look like cops .
why are you trying to scare me ?
i' m not trying to scare you .
i just want you to think .
the gangs hold this neighbourhood hostage .
ok , let' s just turn around then .
let' s just go back and we can write a boring thesis regurgitating the usual crap on urban legend .
we' ve got a real shot here , bernadette .
an entire community starts attributing the daily horrors of their lives to a mythical figure .
now , if trevor and archie were in on this do you think they' d chicken out ?
in a second .
exactly .
all right .
you want to wait here for me ?
no .
well , let' s go .
and lock the car .
hey now .
want something , baby ?
i got it for you .
yo , baby ...
which way you going ?
just going inside .
yeah ?
hey , come up in here .
who you looking for ?
a friend of ours .

look like five oh to me .
ask blondie where she going .
who you going to see ?
let' s take the stairs .
come on .
hands up , people !
five oh coming up the back door .
it' s ok they think we' re cops .
they' re not going to follow us .
hang on .
look at this .

" sweets to ...

" sweets to the sweet .
hurry up , helen .
let me just get the door .
sorry .
jesus , helen .
here it is .
don' t go in there .
come on .
come on .
jesus , it stinks .
see , i was right .
the layout is identical which means the bathroom is over there .
helen ...
what' s the problem ?
a woman died in there .

it' s all right .
there' s nothing to see .
wait a minute .
this is where he crawled through , right ?
yeah .
well , we found it .
let' s go .
wait a second .
ok , hang onto this .
what ?
i' m just going to go through and when i get back , we' re out of here .

anne marie mccoy .

sorry we disturbed you .
we' il just get out of your way .

i' m scared .
scared for my child .
they ain' t never gonna catch him .
who ?
candyman .
lf they asked for something , if they saw something they liked , and you point ...
they thought it was rude to point .
so what did they do ?
spat over people .
it was quite extraordinary .
be nice .
i am being nice .
so , how are the two most beautiful graduate students getting along ?
trevor tells me you' ve been dabbling in my favourite subject .
i can' t wait to review your data .
i can fit you in tomorrow morning .
we' re not ready yet .
that' s precisely the moment in which i can be of greatest assistance before you disappear down a path to academic bolivia .
i' ve been there .
actually , purcell , we' re about to bury you .
helen ...
what ?
we' il have something in a week or so .
it' s just that we only went to cabrini today ...
ah !
cabrini green ?
candyman country .
well , if you' re after the hook man , helen , you must read the paper i wrote about him ten years ago .
you do know the story , don' t you ?
no .
then how are you going to bury me ?
the legend first appeared in 1 890 .
candyman was the son of a slave .
his father had amassed a considerable fortune from designing a device for the mass producing of shoes after the civil war .
candyman had been sent to all the best schools and had grown up in polite society .
he had a prodigious talent as an artist and was much sought after when it came to the documenting of one' s wealth and position in society in a portrait .
well , it was in this latter capacity that he was commissioned by a wealthy landowner to capture his daughter' s virginal beauty .
well , of course , they fell deeply in love and she became pregnant .
poor candyman .
her father executed a terrible revenge .
he paid a pack of brutal hooligans to do the deed .
they chased candyman through the town to cabrini green where they proceeded to saw off his right hand with a rusty blade .
no one came to his aid .
but this was just the beginning of his ordeal .
nearby there was an apiary .
dozens of hives , filled with hungry bees .
they smashed the hives and stole the honeycomb and smeared it over his prone , naked body .
candyman was stung to death by the bees .
they burned his body on a giant pyre then scattered his ashes over cabrini green .
hello .
anne marie ain' t in .
are you sure ?
yeah .
she said you' d be back .
what' s your name ?
jake .
listen , jake , maybe you can help me out .
i wanted to find out about that woman who got killed .
do you know anything about that ?
her name was ruthie jean .
i don' t know nothing .
did anybody else talk about it ?
you know , it' s ok to talk to me , jake ... because i' m not a cop so nobody' s going to get in trouble .
i can' t say nothing or candyman will get me .
candyman ?
you scared of him ?
i ain' t scared of nobody but you' re crazy walking here on your own .
it ain' t safe around here .
yeah , i know .
but i don' t scare too easy either , jake .
you know , you don' t have to tell me .
you could just show me .
and if you show me where candyman is
i' il make you a promise .
it will be our secret .
unless you' re too scared .
somebody building a bonfire ?
yeah , for the party .
in there .
candyman' s in there ?
my friend charlie say so .
a boy got killed there .
who was he ?
ain' t sure .
charlie tell me he was weird .
he was crazy ?
no , a retard .
his mom was in the store ... and the boy , he need to go , you know , to the bathroom .
his mom was taking her time choosing this , looking at that so the boy start moaning .
his mom get mad at him send him across the street .
his mom is at the checkout .
she hears her boy screaming .
mommy !
mommy !
there' s a big tough guy .
he runs over to check it out .
he come out of there shaking and crying .
he only been in there five seconds .
come out of there and his hair turned white .
i mean , it turned white just like that .
was the boy murdered ?
worse .
he' s lying on the floor in a pool of blood holding himself .
mommy !
mommy !
they found it floating in the toilet .
can' t fix that .
better off dead .
did candyman do this ?
listen , you wait here for me , ok ?
ok .
hello ?
candyman .
oh , excuse me .
i' m done here .
i' il just get out of your way .
listen , i don' t want to interfere with your business .
i' m not a cop .
i' m from the university of illinois .
i' il just get out of your way .
come on !
let me go !
you' re not being very smart .
my colleagues know where i am and they' re expecting me back .
now let me go !
i hear you looking for candyman , bitch .
well , you found him .
we hear you' re looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
number four step forward and say the line .
we hear you' re looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
number five step forward and say the line .
we hear you' re looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
take ' em out .
it' s number five .
good work .
how d' you catch him ?
we swept the place .
we start from the top floor and work our way down .
that way you can flush ' em all out .
whole of cabrini is locked down now .
you' re very lucky to be alive , ms lyle .
did he kill ruthie jean ?
no question .
killed that poor kid as well .
he ran the overlords .
we knew everything about him .
only reason why we didn' t bring him in before because we couldn' t find anyone to testify .
we can' t protect them down at cabrini green and they knew that .
what about the little boy ... jake ?
we don' t need him .
we have you .
hey , jake .
i just wanted to thank you for saving my life .
i wanna go home .
we' il get you out of here .
you did good .
you said it was our secret .
you lied !
it still is , jake .
you won' t have to go to court .
candyman will get me .
candyman isn' t real .
he' s just a story .
you know , like dracula or ... or frankenstein .
a bad man took his name so he could scare us .
but now he' s locked up everything' s going to be ok .
candyman ain' t real ?
no .
hey there !
whoa .
slow down .
you' re supposed to be the invalid here .
look , see ?
it' s much better today .
yeah , it looks great .
come sit down .
you haven' t eaten already ?
no , of course not .
ok , good .
hey !
welcome back .
thanks .
let me see .
i' m so glad you' re ok .
but you know what bugs me about the whole thing ?
two people get brutally murdered and the cops do nothing .
a white woman gets attacked and they lock the place down .
this was a bad guy .
you got him put away .
that' s what matters .
oh !
i' ve got a surprise for you .
what ?
you' re not going to believe it .
the pictures .
my friend in the photography department managed to save most of them .
i' d written them off .
the camera was smashed .
i' ve been talking to some publishers and there' s a lot of interest since you made the local section .
we' re going to be published .
i' il come over tomorrow at 9 : 00 .
we' il get started ?
yeah .
helen ...
yes ?
helen ...
who is that ?
who is that ?
helen ...
i came for you .
do i know you ?
no ... no ... but you doubted me .
i' m sorry .
i have to go .
no need to leave yet .
but i' m late .
you were not content with the stories so i was obliged to come .
be my victim .

i am the writing on the wall the whisper in the classroom .
without these things i am nothing so now i must shed innocent blood .

frank .
ms lyle , you' re under arrest .
do you understand ?
please let me explain .
do you understand ?
yes , but ...
you have the right to remain silent .
do you understand ?
this is crazy .
i was attacked .
respond to the question .
i understand .
at approximately 1 0 : 00 pm .
anne marie mccoy returned to her apartment .
she discovered her dog with its head cut off .
she cried for assistance at which point you attacked her with a meat cleaver .
you were still in possession of this weapon when the arresting officers came to her aid .
where' s the baby ?
i ... l don' t know .
you' re sick .
before i ask any further questions would you like to have counsel ?
yes or no ?
i ... l' d like to make a phone call .
i' m sorry , we can' t take your call .
please leave a message after the tone .
trevor , are you there ?
pick up .
it' s an emergency , trevor .
pick up the phone .
i' ve been arrested .
i' m at the 1 8th district .
can you ... can you please come pick me up ?
that' s it .
do you know what time it is ?
3 : 00 am .
noooo !
no !
oh , god .
there' s got to be another way out .
cover her face .
don' t say anything .
ok .
all right .
you' il be fine .
just keep your head down .
it' s going to be fine .
all right , people , back off , back off !
we have no comment .
no comment .
nothing to say .
do you know the baby' s whereabouts ?
my client has not been charged with a thing !
lnformation has indicated that baby anthony was abducted and may still be alive .
the blood may have come from the dog .
a suspect was released this morning after questioning and i guess we' il just have to follow this one ...
well , at least they didn' t mention your name .
that' s good .
now , they haven' t charged you , because they think they' il find the body which means , i' m afraid they' re shooting for murder one , but i don' t think they have a chance .
do you think i did it ?
no .
nobody believes that .
but it' s crossed your mind ?
is there anything , any detail , however small , that you can recall , that would help us substantiate your version of events ?
i ... l blacked out .
i mean , i don' t know what happened .
i just woke up in that place and there was blood everywhere .
can i get you anything ?
are you sure ?
look , honey ...
i was supposed to go to the campus and pick up some work .
i' m concerned about leaving you alone though .
i' il only be about 20 minutes .
trevor ...
where were you last night ?
i was here .
i was fast asleep .
i thought you were with bernadette .
look , honey ...
i' m going to stand by you .
we' re going to get through this ok ?
i' il be right back .
believe in me .
be my victim .
do you believe in me ?
keep away from me .
i have the child .
allow me to take you or he will die in your place .
your disbelief destroyed the faith of my congregation .
without them , i am nothing .
so i was obliged to come .
and now i must kill you .
your death will be a tale to frighten children , to make lovers cling closer in their rapture .
come with me and be immortal .
helen ?
bernadette ...
bernadette , go .
helen ?
helen , honey .

' you would not beg to live .

' to live in other people' s dreams
' but not to have to be .
' do you understand ? '
' please , god ,
' don' t let him kill the baby . '
trevor !
trevor ?

trevor , you were all i had left .

if you' d like to make a call , please hang up and try again .
they will all abandon you .
all you have left is my desire for you .
helen .
you came to me .
the child .
we had a deal .
surrender to me now and he shall be unharmed .
we have a bargain .
but i' m afraid .
do you fear the pain or what is beyond ?
both .
the pain , i can assure you , will be exquisite .
as for our deaths , there is nothing to fear .
our names will be written on a thousand walls .
our crimes told and retold by our faithful believers .
we shall die together in front of their very eyes and give them something to be haunted by .
come with me and be immortal .

we must be on our way now , you and l .
our bones will soon be ashes and we shall never be separated again .

we commend to almighty god our sister helen and we commit her body to the ground .
earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust .
the lord bless her and keep her and give her peace .
