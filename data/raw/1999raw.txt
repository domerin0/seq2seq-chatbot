carl' s jr . has this $6 burger , which really only costs $3 . 95 ... ... so you think you' re getting some deal ... ... but the truth is , it may be the best franchise burger out there . i went there yesterday and ordered three .
by golly , those suckers almost filled me up .
when i got home , i still had to have a box of eggos ... ... but that doesn' t take away from carl' s achievement . i mean , here' s a guy who' s got to go through life as carl junior , right ?
like he can never get out of the shadow of his dad , the original carl , i guess .
do you think this eating has to do with thinking you killed your mother ?
that you' re eating yourself to death as punishment ?
you do think you killed her , right ? i never said that .
she called out to you from that big , fancy oak bed .
she said she was having chest pain . i never told you any of that !
how could you know this ?
she begged you to dial 911 .
but she was always calling out for you , wasn' t she , barry ?
you weren' t there .
how could you know what happened ?
how ?
doesn' t matter .
what matters is , you' ve got to stop blaming yourself . if you don' t , you' il eat yourself into an early grave for no reason .
you' re looking in my head !
stop it !
don' t look in there .
you don' t have to do it , barry .
leave me alone !
it wasn' t your fault .
jonesy ?
hey , how are you doing , henry ?
what' s that you say ?
are you going deaf ?
how are you doing ?
you know .
ssdd .
well , yeah , of course .
hey , you know , i was thinking if you were free this weekend we might go see duddits .
yeah , absolutely .
he' s been on my mind a lot too . it' s been a long time .
it' s open !
i gotta go . i got a thing here . i' il see you saturday .
yeah , right .
see you saturday .
so , mr. defuniak ... ... do you know we' re both escapees from maine ?
you' re from pittsfield .
do you know what happens to scholarship students caught cheating on exams ?
you had the flu that day , didn' t you , david ?
you didn' t take the exam ?
you missed the test .
and since you were ill , why not write me an essay instead ?
3000 words on the short term results of the norman conquest .
go get started .
yes , sir .
better to be from pittsfield than go back to it .
thank you , sir .
how did you know ?
you weren' t even there that day .
sometimes i just know .
hello .
this probably won' t work .
never start that way with a car salesman .
we love challenges .
pete moore . in one hour i' m showing a house in fryeburg . it' s a big commission .
and i just lost my damn car keys .
could you possibly make me duplicates ?
that takes at least a day .
oh , boy , i just knew it !
easy , trish .
maybe i can help . i' m always good at finding things .
did i tell you my name ? i don' t remember  i guessed .
now , let' s find those keys .
hey , rachel .
hey , pete .
miss , i looked again . i couldn' t find them .
okay . i need your help .
you had the coffee in your hand , bought aspirin ... ... went to your car , realized the keys were gone .
that everything ?
yes .
look .
this is gonna seem weird , but it' s just a thing i do to help me think .
you bought a candy bar before the aspirin .
mars bar .
yours , right ?
one more question . lf i find your keys , will you let me buy you dinner ?
west wharf ?
6 : 30 ?
best fried clams in the state ? it' s right on your way back .
sure .
okay .
that' d be nice .
all right .
so you got here .
you opened your purse .
coffee , candy and aspirin , you' re juggling it all around .
and that' s when ...
... you dropped your keys .
it' s just luck , is all .
thank you .
west wharf , right ?
half past six ?
you got it .
another fuckarow .
jones .
how are you doing ?
hey , beaver .

same shit , different day .

no , you' re trying to get home .
what' s up ?
really , i got nothing .
go home .
wait , jonesy ?
yeah , beav ?
you be careful .
be careful of what ?
wish i knew .
what did you say ?
i didn' t say anything .
right .
sorry .
somebody call an ambulance ! it won' t do any good . i looked away for one second .
then i heard a thump .
what happened ?
oh , my god !
professor jones ! i just saw him .
he can' t die !
clear !
no good .
flatline .
hit it again !
clear !
what do you think ? i think it' s no good . i think he' s gone .
watch out for ister gay .
jonesy , don' t try to lift that stuff .
just go up to the cabin .
i' il get that .
here , here , look .
big jacket .
beaver , i' m going in !
all right , i' il see you in a second !
watch the beer .
got blown last night .
good for you .
first time ?
bite my bag .
met some lady at bingo , went back to her place , turned into a nice fuckaree .
as opposed to a fuckarow .
obviously .
though i' ve had perfectly good fuckarees turn into fuckarows in a flash .
try viagra .
viagra ? i' m practically at full salute all day . i' m ....
what do you call it ?
privatic ?
prag prasmatic ?
henry will know .
you' re thinking of fourth grade .
you' re having wood problems ?
you haven' t tried it , have you ?
hell , no !
drop that little blue bomb , you' re hard as a louisville slugger for 12 hours .
twelve hours ? i' m talking yastrzemski .
you don' t have to need it to love it .
bingo ?
did you say bingo , like the game in church basements ?
there' s trim there .
beaver ! i thought my deal was pathetic .
you just watch .
that' s your job . i' m fine .
h , you been thinking about duddits more than usual ?
remember we were gonna go see him that weekend ? i remember .
then i got hit .
i gotta tell you something weird .
the night i got hit , i was standing there and across the street , i saw duddits .
just like he was that day we first saw him back in derry .
he was calling out for help and everyone was ignoring him .
then he looked over at me .
he looked directly at me .
and he motioned for me to come to him .
you believe i saw him , don' t you ?
yes , sir , i do .
duddits loves me , i know that .
he loves us all .
he would die before he' d ever hurt us .
so why was he calling me into the street to get hit ?
maybe there' s more to the story we don' t get yet .
you don' t know shit .
name it ! i' il name it after we come up with a small wager .
50 bucks .
what' s the subject ? in the movies , when people wake up together ... ... they immediately start kissing and going at it .
but they never get up first , take a leak and brush their goddamn teeth .
which is pretty much necessary when you wake up .
what' s it called when you got a constant woody ?
you mean priapism .
see ?
i' m practically priasmic .
priapismic .
whatever ! it' s hard .
that' s what you' re betting on ?
no , i can name the one movie where they acknowledge the scuzzy facts of life . i' il give you a quarter .
a quarter from you .
50 bucks from you .
promised land .
promised land ?
never heard of it .
meg ryan and what' s his name ?
reefer sutherland .
kiefer .
from , i don' t know , 1988 or something ?
so meg ryan wakes up in the morning and says , " where' s the cat ?
and he says , " what cat ? " and she says , " the cat that shit in my mouth .
that will be 50 small .
bullshit !
you made it up .
could beaver make that up ?
you can have that priceless piece of cinematic trivia absolutely free . i' m filing that in the " who gives a shit " section of my memory warehouse .
what' s the memory warehouse ?
you don' t remember ? i must' ve forgot .
you forgot ?
just remind me .
don' t give me shit . it' s in his head .
we' ve all got one .
hasn' t that place been condemned ?
not yet . it' s so crowded i have to throw something out every time i learn something new .
when i got my new laptop i had to throw out all my files of rock ' n ' roll lyrics .
my warehouse was washed away in a flood about 10 years ago . i didn' t know they had enough beer in maine for a flood .
jonesy , if that really is your name ... ... what do you do with the discarded files ? i burn them .
you threw away the lyrics to " blue bayou " ?
no .
no , if i really can' t let go of something ... ... i sneak it back to an office where i keep my secret stuff .
where do you keep the stuff on duddits ?
he' s got a special section all his own on the third level . i can' t stop thinking about the duds lately .
how about you guys ? it' s this place .
he' s all around here , even though he' s never been here .
this is our 20th year coming out here to hole in the wall .
and fuck me , freddy , here' s to 20 more .
twenty more .
here' s to duddits ... ... our dreamcatcher .
wish he was here .
to the duds .

why is tina schlossinger' s pussy on the wall of tracker brothers ?
because i said so . it' s a picture .
have you seen it ?
no ... ... but the kid who sits behind me in shop , he saw it .
tracker brothers is deserted .

pete can fly .
when you come for us , all we have to do is get in your way . i can' t catch that little dick ?
you know who that is ?
that' s pete moore .
that' s right , fat ass .
pete moore .
no one can catch him .
he' s going straight to his house to tell his mother .
she' il call the cops and then we' il see .
you know him , is that it ?
never saw him .
then why ask for trouble ? i mean , look at this moron !
he likes this attention .
how do you know what he likes ?
come on , you dickweeds !
you want to fight us ?
yes !
yes ! i' m gone , henry .
just say the word .
why ?
you' il lose !
why ?
because you can' t do that ! it' s wrong !
and i' m gonna tell the world !

you want us to leave , is that it ?
no !
let' s kick their asses !
let' s go .
we' il get him later .
you know that .

it' s okay .
you can stop now .

no .
we came for him .
hey , pete .
you forgot the dogs .

you' re all right .
thank god .

rick mccarthy .
gary jones .
but it' s jonesy to everybody .
our damn cell phones are on the blink now , so i can' t call for help ... ... but our car will be back soon . i didn' t think i' d make it . i lost the folks i was with .
you saved me , that' s for sure .
what' s that ?
it' s a dreamcatcher .
lndian charm .
catches nightmares ... ... keeps them away .
keeps you safe down here . i' ve had enough nightmares .
been doing that all night .
i ate some berries in the dark .
i think they must have upset me .
i know what you' re thinking .
anyone who drinks at 11 a . m . needs to take the cure , but i only do it here . in the real world , i never drink till after 5 : 00 ... ... and if it ever does , i' m on the wagon for life .
glad to hear it .
what' s the matter with you ?
about six months ago , the day jonesy got hit ... ... i did something terrible with a patient .
humiliated him .
drove him out of the office .
barry neiman .
couple days ago , i saw his picture in the paper .
he ate himself to death .
mind if i don' t use that story next time i' m trying to sell a mustang ?
henry , you were a lead balloon long before this porker munched his way to eternity .
thanks .
you' re a real comfort .
you got a real delicate touch to you .
here you go , rick , buddy .
that will fix you up .
jesus christ bananas !
some fuckarow this is turning into !
thanks a lot , pete .
yeah , i think i got it all .
what happened to you ?
hi .
joe clarendon .

rick here had a bad night in the woods .
welcome . is that frostbite ?
no , i get the same thing from peanuts . it' s allergy .
grilled cheese , anyone ?
no , the soup' s fine for me , thanks . i' il bite .
sail it over here .
my mother used to feed me pea soup when i was feeling
bitch in a buzz saw ! i' ve heard some mighty burps in my time , but that' s the blue ribbon . i am so embarrassed .
rick ate some berries in the woods .
oh , my god !
oh , my god , that' s awful ! i' m so sorry !
rick , buddy , don' t worry about it .
there' s more room out than in , anyway .
what have you been eating , woodchuck turds ?

thank you for taking me in .
thank you both .
shit , anybody would have .

fuck me , give me some air !
we got any gas masks handy ?
we need a biohazard team in here .
wanna hear what will freak you out more ?
not really .
you know his huge stomach ?
when he got here , his stomach was normal , but his chest was out to here ! i wish henry was here .
he' s a shrink , not an internist .
he went to med school .
did you ?
i thought about it .
you better get a run at it .

guy ended up bald as telly what' s his fuck .
this guy' s got plenty of hair .
but that red mark got bigger while i was watching it .
what are you doing ?
peanut butter calms me down .
somebody else might want to use that jar . i' il leave some .
beav .
beaver .
criminettlies !
i think it' s a woman .
i ought to warn you . i' m gonna strangle this broad . i' d guess she' s already dead . i' il strangle her anyway .
she almost got us both killed .

say something .
i have to find rick .
okay .
rick .
yeah .

what' s all that red stuff on their fur ?
just like mccarthy' s cheek . i never saw anything like this before .
even the bears look scared .

where are they going ?
it' s not where that worries me ... ... it' s what are they running away from ?
what the hell ?
this could be perfect .
they can get stinky to a hospital .

keep her warm .
right hand to god , dr. d.
henry ! if we die before you get back ... ... promise you' il tell everybody she wasn' t my date .

rick , you okay ? i' m a little sick , fellas . i just need to make a little room .
mccarthy , rick , open up , man .

can' t a man have some privacy ?
rick , where are you bleeding from ?

scooby dooby doo , we got some work to do now .

shut up a minute .
mr. mccarthy ?
rick ? is he still alive ? i don' t know .
rick ?
rick , are you ?
oh , man !
jonesy , if he can still do that , he must be alive .
can you hear me ? i think he' s dead .
bullshit !
he dropped a clinker ! i heard it . i don' t think that was a clinker .
that' s enough , snap out of it !
oh , my god !
my god !
no !
no ?
good move ! it' s trapped .
got nowhere to go but the septic tank .
oh , shit !
listen , beaver , we' re gonna change places .
what ?
one of us is gonna go to the shed .
no way !
shut up and listen !
there' s friction tape there .
you go get it , come back .
we' il tape the lid down .
then we' re gonna get the hell out of here !
you get the tape , jonesy .
don' t be brave , beav .
you' re faster than me . i' il sit on thumper .
no , if it does get out , you can' t fight it .
not with your hip .
oh , my god !
goddamn it !
go !
and beav ?
yeah ?
sit tight , buddy .
okay .
all right .
okay .
shit !
earth to jonesy !
come in , jonesy !
jonesy .
jonesy .
calm down now .
okay .
okay .
okay , here it is .
okay .
find the damn tape !
where is it ?
coming , beav !
beaver !
beav ! i got the what the
jonesy , get out of here !
beaver .
get out !
shut the door !
no .
run , jonesy .
you killed him .
you killed beaver .
you killed him , you fuck !
what do you want ?
the men call the red stuff ripley , after the broad in the alien movies .
we eradicate the animals as they flee the blue zone .
and the populace ?
we' re bringing civilians to gosselin' s .
we' il detain them till we figure this out .
and owen ?
this time the ets belong to you .
that' s right , bucko .
you' il be blue boy leader .
finally .
how many left ?
about a hundred .
yeah .
not nearly enough for a serious incursion .
my guess is , it' s a crash landing .
they' ve never picked terrain like this before .
or cold weather .
what' s your call ?
the biggest threat is them getting out of our net .
crash landing or not ... ... they' il try to get out and spread the infection .
i always say they never visited a world they wouldn' t rather own .
they' re up to their old tricks .
using a standard grayboy look ... ... with the innocent doggy eyes and smooth baby butt skin .
they project what they think we want to see .
but i' ve had a look at the real thing .
you wouldn' t want it marrying your sister .
difference of opinion about the ripley .
really ?
who has an opinion ?
who do you think ?
general matheson .
three star general matheson .
three ?
when did you see him ?
they called me in yesterday .
what' s the opinion of those enlightened cocksuckers ... ... who' ve never been near an et ?
they say the fungus doesn' t take hold in all victims .
some of them get over it .
really ?
and what about the shit weasels ?
the ones blasting out the basement door ?
does matheson think folks get over one of those puppies ?
their theory is , they' il only grow in a small percentage of the exposed population .
do you like that theory , bucko ?
i think it' s crap .
so if you thought someone had been exposed ...
... and you had them in your grasp  i wouldn' t want them walking out ...
... to wander as they wish .
bucko , i think we' re on the same page .
pissing in the same latrine . if the ripley gets out of this pine tree paradise ....
well , it just can' t be allowed to do that .
i' ve quarantined the entire area .
nothing leaves alive .
roger that , boss .
come !
got maples here , boss .
corporal maples , sir . i mean , boss . i know who you are , maples . i handpicked every man in blue boy group .
sometimes i wonder about my judgment .
yes , sir . i' m sorry , boss .
do you know the blue unit catechism ?
yes , the b. u. c. for all buckos . is blue unit part of regular army ?
no , boss .
better .
how does blue unit operate ?
under the radar .
we do not salute , display rank , say " sir . " a force unto ourselves .
regular army compared to blue unit ?
pussies .
under what rules does blue unit operate ?
rules of combat .
that' s right , laddie .
when a soldier disobeys a superior' s orders , he puts everyone at risk .
and is to be punished immediately by appropriate command personnel .
that' s me .
capisce ?
good .
now answer me one question and you can boogie out of here .
but you have to answer honestly .
you were on containment detail at 0600 this morning , sector 14 of blue zone .
did you allow a young woman and her 4 year old daughter ... ... to exit the zone in their own vehicle on hickam valley road ?
colonel curtis , she hadn' t been in the zone .
she made a wrong turn .
she couldn' t have been contaminated .
you know this for a fact ?
or because she told you so ?
for a fact , boss .
scout' s honor ?
can you raise your hand and tell me honestly that you know this for a fact ?
then do it , maples .
swear on it .
scout' s honor .
scout' s honor .
stop your blatting , laddie buck !
you just avoided a court martial , boy .
you lie to me again , you' il be facing a firing squad .
get him out before i change my mind .
let' s get him out of here .
sentry !
jesus , abe . i warned him .
could have gotten off with a slap on the wrist . instead of taking his whole hand ?
he crossed the curtis line !
he came into my house , told me lies .
you think i' m crazy , owen ?
a little .
i lost my temper there .
but that little worm did something worse .
the pretty mom he let pass this morning ?
she' s down at the barn right now crawling with the ripley .
twenty five years , owen .
twenty five years i' ve been going out to fight these alien bastards ... ... show them they picked the wrong place , knocked on the wrong fucking door .
and frankly , laddie , the tank is running a little low .
luckily for me , there' s one bit of good news in this blizzard of bullshit . i have you .
to lead the assault today and to take over for me tomorrow .
what are you talking about , abe ? it' s my last dance , owen .
from now on , you will lead the band .
you know where i got that ?
john wayne .
that' s right .
he gave it to me .
and now i' m giving it to you .
abe , i don' t know how to ....
let' s not get all girlie with each other .
just tell me how we do it .
we go in fast and hard .
how do we come out ?
clean ... ... and smiling .
honey , i' m home .
that' s a good idea .
catch a little shuteye .
save your energy for those horrendous farts !
well , it' s very nice of you to say so . i find you very attractive also .
you' re one of those rare women who can handle the full size ford expedition .
the truck that handles like a luxury car .
a really big luxury car .
but seriously , folks , there is one issue i' d like to bring up ... ... just in case i should , you know , kick the bucket out here ... ... turn into a goddamn petesicle .
not that i think that' s inevitable . i' m sure henry or jonesy or beaver will be coming to get us soon .
they' re my friends .
we' re all best friends .
now , ma' am , i' il be very candid with you about this ... ... so please , don' t get freaked out or think that i' m some kind of weirdo ... ... who you shouldn' t meet for the best fried clams in maine .
just some innocent fried clams at the west wharf !
you see , the four of us , best friends ... ... we all have this other friend by the name of duddits .
and our friend duddits , well , he' s not your average old buddy .
one day , a long time ago , he gave us all this kind of gift . it' s this ....
how shall i put it ?
this ability .
this ability to know things ... ... to talk to each other without talking at all , just mind to mind .
do you see what i' m getting at ?
i knew you would .
lately , i' ve been having this dream ... ... and in the dream , i understand how duddits could give us a gift like that .
i think maybe our friend duds is not from this planet . i think duddits is from somewhere else ... ... and he came here to prepare us for something .
it' s crazy .
talking shit about the only perfect person i ever knew .
he' s so goddamned good . i can' t believe he' s a human .
i should be singing his praises , not questioning what galaxy he' s i gotta pee .
that' s what i should be doing .
here' s to you , duds .
the highest civilian decoration .
lord , i will never drink again .
let me get this straight .
yesterday you want to call it quits , throw in the towel , pull the plug , curtains .
today , you' re begging , praying .
couple more hours .
couple more miles .
make up your mind .
jonesy !

what the hell ?
who' s mr. gray ?

or is it jonesy ?
that' s what your friends call you , isn' t it ?
let' s be friends .

beaver never hurt a soul and you killed him .
he had nothing in his head . i' ve found something useful in yours .

rather distasteful , i must say .
how about this , mr. gray ?
eat shit and die .
why did you call me mr. gray ?
watch out for ister gay .
someone told you about me .
who told you about me ? if you want to know , why don' t you read my mind ?
surprisingly , you' re able to keep things from me ... ... i don' t understand it .
but i' m sure i' il figure it out soon .
oh , pete , jesus !
motherfucker tried to bite my dick off , jonesy . i always thought it would be my ex wife did that .
let' s get you to some help .
can you still see the line , buddy ? i don' t need the line to get to gosselin' s .

95 ?
who gives a shit ? i' m hurting here , jonesy .

what have you got in that part of your mind , professor ?
your memories are out here in the warehouse , aren' t they ? i want to know who warned you about me .
and who taught pete that nifty trick ? i' m sure the answers are here . it' il just take me a while to find them .
to find them .
think about letting me in . it' s the polite thing to do .
polite thing to do .
beav !

yeah , it' s a mystery .
we need you to solve it .
dreamcatcher .
duds' il read our minds .

josie , josie , josie .
josie rinkenhauer .
josie ?

can you find josie ?
this is completely crazy .
you can say that again . i didn' t say anything .

we' re dying .
there is no infection here .
whose radio is that ? it' s not the radio .
they' re putting it into our heads .
we are helpless .
there it is , gentlemen .
there' s no infection here .
directly into our heads .
this gives you an idea what we' re up against .
if anybody' s thinking , " those poor , helpless little folk ... ... all naked and unarmed beside their crashed intergalactic winnebago ... ... what kind of a dog , what kind of a monster ... ... could hear that heartbreak and go in just the same ?
well , i' m that dog . i' m that monster .
we are helpless .
we are dying .
these mothers are as harmless as a fox in a henhouse .
and i' m here to kick some ass !
are you with me ?
yes , boss !
roger that , boss .
right on , boss .
don' t hurt us .
i have a visual .

blue boy group , this is blue boy leader .

don' t hurt us .
please , don' t hurt us .
there is no infection here .
we are helpless .
fire at will !

owen , get them out of there !

blue boy group , withdraw at once . i repeat , cease firing and back off !

blue boy group , get out of there !
we' re on top of it !
owen , pull out now !

jonesy , i' ve been thinking about our friend .
our scooby doo buddy .
for a long time i thought he was sent to us to warn us about something . i could never figure what it was .
don' t talk about him .
not till today . it was this , right now .
he wanted to warn us .
go ahead , pete .
tell me about your friend .
did he show you that nifty trick ?
no .
jonesy' s right .
come on , pete .
let' s talk .
bite my bag , motherfucker !
all right , pete , i' il bite .
your bag and everything else .
no , no !
you bastard !
no !
pete .
don' t talk to him !
get out of there !
what' s up ?
thank god you came by , governor . i' m broke down here and fearing for my life .
that' s a good looking dog .
where you headed ?
gosselin' s .
any chance you' re going near there ?
that' s where i' m going .
well , i believe your tailgate has come open .
let' s take a look .
i see you have some cargo you' re taking to blue base .
got a treat for you , ike .
all you can eat .
eat all the red stuff .
good doggy .
yes .
good boy .
have your fill .
tasty , tasty .
eat all you want
jonesy .
what are you up to ?
jonesy !
oh , god !
halt or we' il fire !
you cannot leave the quarantine zone !
halt ! i think i just about halted here .
come with me , owen . i' il show you things you' il wish you' d never seen .
how long we gotta be here ? it' il be all right .
i demand to see my lawyer !
there must be something they can do .
don' t worry , you' il be fine .
when do we get out ?
within hours .
you can' t do this to people in america ! i told you to stay over there !
my wife  government' s doing everything they can ... ... to get you out of here .
please don' t worry . it' s all right .
we' re doing everything to make sure you' re safe .
we' il get you back to your homes within hours .
all clear .
can i help you , sir ?
what' s your name ?
henry .
dr. henry devlin .
a doctor ?
good .
we need doctors in there .
come on , laddie , i' il buy you a cup .
you , sir , where you from ?
boston .
beantown ?
great city .
we' il have you back there in no time .
maybe by morning .
hurry up , bucko .
you see that crud on the faces of children ... ... you know why i relish a turn in the country like we had today .
you were excellent out there , o. it made me feel very proud to
abe ?
abe , you okay ?
abe ?
yeah , i' m fine . i' m fine . i must be getting too old for this shit .
i don' t know what the hell that was about .
it' s the only way , owen .
we' ve got to cauterize the site .
they' ve all got to die .
it' s the only way .
but we don' t know that .
the studies point to the strong possibility of recovery for many exposed subjects .
the studies show squat , that' s what they show . if matheson had been in my spot for the last quarter century ... ... you' d have never made it to your first jerk off .
those gray bastards would have had you for lunch back in armpit , kentucky .
some get better .
at least half will be over it in a few days
which ones , mother teresa ?
can you guarantee they won' t take it home like a present for the family ? i' il tell you what you should be worried about .
what should be on your mind .
not these few unfortunates .
what you should be worried about is a hitchhiker .
what ?
a hitchhiker .
our greatest fear is that a grayboy would catch a ride ... ... with somebody and would carry them out of here , without being consumed .
to scatter the infection , like johnny fucking appleseed .
are you sure there isn' t such a person ?
no .
but i am sure that if there is one he won' t get out .
not with the net my boys put up around the blue zone .
and if we do a thorough job on the ones we' ve got . if we don' t get gooey about the little picture when our job is taking care of the big one .
capisce ?
owen , if you think this is easy for me , you' re crazier than my mother was .
those poor schmucks .
they drive chevrolets , shop at wal mart ... ... never miss an episode of friends .
these are americans .
the idea of slaughtering americans ... ... it just turns my stomach .
but i' il do it . i' il do it because it needs to be done .
so if we start at 2 , we can be done by 2 : 30 .
and it' s all behind us .
except for the dreams .
yeah , except for them .
what are you gonna tell rita about what you did here ?
what are you gonna tell katrina when she' s old enough to ask ?
you know me , don' t you ? i don' t remember when we met , but you know me .
we don' t have time to screw around .
you' ve got two problems .
one you know about , one you don' t .
go ahead .
your mentor , colonel curtis , he' s gone insane from hunting aliens for 25 years .
now he wants you to help him kill hundreds of innocent people .
who are you ?
me ?
talk about that later , once we get out of here .
you' re predictable .
you won' t let me burn on this fence ... ... any more than you' il help curtis kill those people .
what you' re thinking now is whether that digital sat scan transmitter ... ... in your duffle bag will let you get through to somebody .
somebody named general matheson .
sometimes we have to kill , but our real job is to save lives .
your father was a great soldier .
those were his last words .
you carry his picture with you always .
tell me everything .
you' il save these people .
when we' re done talking , get on the transmitter , contact matheson .
cavalry rides in .
that takes care of problem number one .
now comes the hard part .
you think the infection' s been contained , that there' s no hitchhiker .
you' re wrong .
he' s riding with my best friend on earth .
a guy named gary jones .
and he' s out there .
you and i don' t get after him right away , he' il get out of my range ... ... and some kind of shit is gonna hit the planetary fan .
our nightmare hitchhiker .
and all dr. mystery wants is a free pass so he can catch his friend .
very convenient . i' m saying you ought to hear his story .
okay .
where is he ?
had him taken to the tractor shed .
okay . i' il check him out and we can compare notes .
whatever you say , boss .
come on , come on .
time' s a wasting .
all right , lad , open up .
dr. boston ?
are you in here ?
i' m here .
where i' ve been put .
a prisoner on my own damn property .
let' s go !
come on , let' s go .
get in !
you almost ran me down .
figured you' d read my mind and get out of the way .
blue unit , stand down .
you are under regular army command .
put down your weapons at once .
your mission is rescinded .
this is no longer a blue unit operation .
put down your arms .
repeat , put down your arms .
general matheson has assumed command .
okay , owen .
okay .
you just drove over the curtis line .
where we going ?
south .
all i know right now .
just get me in range of jonesy ... ... we' il know everything we need to know .
that' s some gun .
can i have a look ?
kind of flashy for a guy like you , isn' t it ? it' s a gift . i know .
where are you , jonesy ?
pick up the phone .
call 1 800 henry .
hello ?
jonesy !
jesus christ , i knew it was you .
where' s he taking you ?
massachusetts ?
he is ?
duddits ?
okay , i will .
you hang in there , jonesy .
jonesy ?
he hung up .
give me back my gun .
we gotta go to derry .
that where they' re going ?
no , they' re going towards massachusetts .
we need duddits .
jonesy says mr. gray is afraid of duddits .
your buddy , he' s still alive after all this time with mr. gray ?
yeah , he' s immune . i think it' s because he died .
he got hit by a car and his heart stopped .
twice . i don' t think he even knows it .
he came back from the dead .
must have changed him somehow .
it' s almost like duddits saw this whole thing coming . is that it ?
jonesy told me it was duddits who drew him into the accident . if we catch him , we' re gonna have to kill him .
you know we have to do it . it' s the only way to stop mr. gray ... ... assuming we can catch him .
when was the last time you saw duddits ?
long time ago .
years .
what makes you so sure he can help ?
duddits can do anything . i didn' t understand that then , but i think it' s always been true .
he' s the one who made us like this .
like what ?
you know , weird .
he' s been waiting for you .
blizzard slowed us up .
henny , henny .
henny .
i miss you , henny . i miss you .
henny .
long time , henny .
my god , roberta , what is it ?
lymphocytic leukemia .
i' m gonna let you take him , but i have to tell you why .
just now , when he was getting ready ... ... henry he was so excited .
like he hasn' t been in such a long time .
i think ... ... that if he' s with you , he might die happy ... ... instead of in this awful room .
be sure the parka stays on tight .
cold devastates him .
the medication and instructions are in here .
bye , mom .
goodbye , duddie .
be a good boy .
now , go save the world .
i' m all right , laddie .
they haven' t got enough courage to take my trailer .
not yet , anyway .
what' ve we got ?
they' re leaving derry , maine , heading south on 95 .
toward massachusetts .
massachusetts ?
stay with it , bucko .
general matheson .
come in , please .
this is very nice , abe .
been home through some rough times .
was there something we hadn' t covered ? i don' t think i got to say before how much i respect the work you' ve done . it was with sincere regret
herman may i call you herman ?
we may not agree on all the strategic initiatives , but we do agree on this : i' m past it .
burned out .
just needed a push , that' s all .
should have quit after that mess in montana .
even i don' t trust my judgment anymore .
oh , yeah ....
my techies tell me we' re getting some electronics reading hot from in here .
yes , i' ve been talking to the wife on my sat phone . i don' t know if you' ve ever met barbara .
she' s been after me for years to retire .
she' s very happy , i can tell you that . i' il have everything shut down in an hour . if that' s soon enough .
that will be fine .
how do you turn off the goddamn lights ?
maybe you shouldn' t have been so fast to kill that trooper .
you' re making yourself at home .
you have no idea , jonesy .
maybe you shouldn' t have been so fast to kill that trooper . " not bad ?
oh , don' t like that , gary , do you ?
ownzy .
he' s in a police car now .
he' s in a police car now .
can you see where they are , duds ?
ownzy .
he' s in ister gay .
mr. gray .
that' s right , duds , he is in mr. gray . " ister gay " is mr. gray .
we gotta save this girl .
save the world ?
not the world , duds , a girl .
we' il save the world some other time . ister gay ?
you already knew .
where' s he going , duds ?
where is mr. gray taking jonesy ?
ister gay , he want war .
war ?
not war , water .
mr. gray wants water . i know where he' s going .
he' s going to the quabbin reservoir .
what' s quabbin ? it supplies drinking water for all of boston .
what ?
one worm kills the world .
one worm kills the world ?
oh , my god .
one worm .
back at our cabin , i saw the worms that come out of these weasels .
mr. gray must want to get one into the boston drinking supply .
just one worm infects the whole world ?
are we going right ?
yes .
take the 495 to the mass pike . it' s not far .
you' re doing great , buddy .
now , are you ready to try something hard ? i want to ask you something hard .
yes , henny .
good .
can you talk to jonesy ?
can you make him hear you ?
ownzy ... ... and ister gay .
duddits .
i knew it . i knew it .
he' s been here all along .
waiting .
jonesy ? it appears we didn' t meet by accident .
we owe it to our friend , duddits . i don' t know what you mean .
no ?
maybe not .
maybe your clever friend didn' t want you to know what he was up to .
that' s why you had nothing in the warehouse about me .
duddits didn' t bother to tell you what job he had in mind for you .
it doesn' t matter .
his little scheme didn' t work .
did it , ike ?
no , no .
we' re almost there .
what was it your poetry file had to say ? i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep
and miles to go before i sleep
stop that chopper !
punch it , dude .
don' t be a pussy .
thank you , gary jones .
go up around the reservoir .
aqueduct to boston starts in shaft 1 2 .
patience , bambino .
just up ahead .
stay here and take care of your friend .
no matter what you hear .
so long , doctor .
good doggy .
good girl .
shit !
you son of a bitch !
wait .
wait .
go back to car , duddie .
you' il be safer there .
look out , jonesy .
i knew you' d come , henry . i knew you wouldn' t let me die .
who the fuck are you ?
don' t you know me , h ? i don' t know .
i think i' m gonna have to shoot you .
just to be sure .
well , maybe you' re right , my friend . i don' t know myself if mr. gray is gone .
he could be hiding in here somewhere ... ... waiting for his chance .
tell me something mr. gray couldn' t possibly know .
tell me something only we would know .
ssdd .
not good enough .
well , you decide .
ask me anything .
at tracker brothers , day we met duddits ... ... what was painted on the wall by the window ?
no ...
... bounce ....
no play .
hello ... ... ister gay .
you .
ooby ooby doo ... ... we got some work to do now .
ister gay ... ... go away .
no !
i duddits .
h ?
