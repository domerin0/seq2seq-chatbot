the squirt .
something about how i was conceived , i don' t know .
we gonna think of something .
have trouble finding the place ?
no , sir .
by the way , what a absolutely beautiful hou ...
home you have .
if she thinks she' s getting that yacht , she' s a little dingy .
he always ...
he loves that one .
the point is that we need somebody ... ... who projects confidence in this position .
we' ve seen how you handle yourself .
you' ve been a great cheerleader for this company .
so we were thinking that ...
well , you go ahead and tell him .
no , you go ahead .
what' s up , guys ?

we want you to go on moneylife this afternoon ... ... and announce our quarterly projections .
you' re the guy .
you' re the guy we have faith in .
you can get our positive spin out there .

positive spin .
these are fickle times , dick .
we need to stick together as a team .
like my daddy always used to say ...
well , you can count on me , sir .
i mean , i can' t tell you how happy i am .
thank you .
how were those eggs florentine ?

good answer .
i' m on the plane right now !

i' m episcopalian !

you ...

no , you , miss ...
phyilis , can i ?
can i talk to you for a minute ?
here' s a yell !
it' s personal .
never actually had makeup on .
i' m happy for you .
hi .
hi .
where' s sam ?
washington .
these are your talking points .
they were just faxed over .
and sam is on the line for you .
hello .
mr. harper .
hey , sam .
how you doing ?
nice talking to you .
i thought you were gonna be here .
me too .
i hear it' s beautiful there .
that' s the thing ...

yep , sure . three , two ...
today we' re talking with the new vp of communications at globodyne ... ...
dick harper .
how you doing , dick ?
just terrific , sam .
thank you for asking .
and so is globodyne , by the way .
now , dick , tell me , what is the shareholder to make ... ... of the fact that jack mccallister , your ceo ... ... has unloaded a considerable share of his stocks ?
i think ceos sell their stocks for many reasons , sam .
both professional and personal .
actually , over the past year , jack mccallister has sold 80 percent ... ... of his holdings through shell companies .
now , how do you explain that ?
the reasons for doing something like that would be ...
losing you there .
hold on .
the reasons for doing something like that would be ...
could be many .
both ...
there' s also talk of some of the globodyne portfolio documents ... ... being subpoenaed .
specifically those of your cfo , frank bascombe .
now , joining us with his insights , is presidential hopeful ralph nader .
really ?
hi , ralph .
big fan , love your stuff .
i wish i could say the same .
i don' t know how you sleep at night .
corporations like globodyne pervert the american dream .
the super rich get richer .
you are a disgrace .
ralph , i don' t know where you' re getting your statistics .
i can only say that , in my estimation , globodyne is transparent .
we' d be more than willing to share any and all documentation .
what is going on ?
can somebody tell me what the heck is ... ?
hey , there' s a fi ...
somebody should ...
okay .
this can' t be good .
out of my way !
hey , that' s my ficus !
my ficus !
you' re not even from this floor !
help !
security !
what' s going on ?
oh , so dick finally wants to know what' s going on .
frank ?
methinks somebody made a boo boo .
maybe we didn' t know how to use quicken .
yeah , that could be it .
frank .
frank .
try to focus .
okay ?
what' s happening to globodyne ?
globodyne ?
yeah , what happened , frank ?
we took our shifting losses ...
yeah ? ... and we put them into businesses ...
yeah , yeah ? ... that we actually owned .
and then the balance sheet ... ... it showed profit .
but actually , there was ... ... debt .
what the hell ? !
you' re sick .
i want you to hit me .
frank , let go of me now .
i want you to hit me .
let go , you' re scaring me .
hit me .
frank !
get off !
and i have the 6000 greatest partners a man could ask for .
mr. mccallister ?
i don' t know what to tell you .
we' re just a cell in a much larger organism called the global economy .
weak companies have to die so that stronger companies can get stronger .
it' s just nature .
nature ?
what ?
you ever read walden pond ?
it' s all in there .
hey , you send him a copy of the tape .
what about the other employees , sir ?
they' re gonna be fine .
don' t go there .

i wasn' t fired .
globodyne tanked .

i' m not sure ... ... but it seems that we may be in a little bit of a pickle , dick .
well , sure , our financial bounce back has taken a bit longer than expected ... ... but , you know , that' s natural .
our lawn was repossessed today .
i didn' t even know they could do that .
i think maybe it' s time you start thinking about accepting something ... ... a little bit lower than a vice presidency .

i have made a mud man !
now , billy is looking at the glass half full .
hon , relax .
we' ve got 600 grand .
where ?
we' re standing in it .
our house .
since globodyne , the local property market crashed , dick .
if we sold our house today , we would owe the bank 150 grand .
i knew it .
it was churning in my gut ... ... and i didn' t listen .
it would be okay .
you said we could afford this house and take out a second mortgage ... ... so that we could put in the pool , redo the kitchen ...
i said that . ... and now we are on the verge ... ... of losing the house .
if we lose the house ... ... then billy loses all sense of security and later , never have a relationship ... ... so he' il just spend his whole life just alone .
there he' il be , just alone , nobody with him , just like a bum .
hon ?
hon ?

you guys are my kind of peeps .
captains of industry , masters of the universe ... ... presidents of hair club for men .
that' s a nice piece of hair .
you can' t even see the tread marks .
this squirrel died of natural causes .
excuse me , pardon me .
i gotta get to the " toppytip " of the financial summit .
isn' t anyone going to do anything ?
this happens every week .
this guy actually isn' t that bad .
i' m a corporate puppet .
and i' m gonna need some more string ... ... so i can go on believing i' il be a real boy someday ... ... without being manipulated ...

dick !
come on , frank .
i just wanna have a talk .
hey there , frankie .
how do you like those eggs florentine ?
wait , wait , wait !
wait , it was jack .
it was jack .
he siphoned off all of globodyne' s assets ... ... and then he dumped the stock .
it was his plan from the beginning .
son of a bitch !
that fucker !
hon , language .
she' s right .
when you get out of prison ... ... you' il get $20 million to keep your mouth shut .
no , 10 .
you think i could have gotten 20 ?
you son of a b ...
you' il break ...
dick .
i want him .
let go .
don' t you think i feel terrible ?
why do you think i' m drinking myself to death ?
instead of drinking , why don' t you do something about it .
yeah , frank .
sometimes the cure is a clean conscience .
that is good .
thanks , hon .
i just thought of it .
you did ?
yeah .
you' re right .
you' re right .
help me up .
help me up .
yeah , help me up .
i gotta think of something .
okay , just give me a minute .
just give me ...
hey .
hey !
not this time , frank .
i' m sorry , i' m sorry , i' m sorry .
it' s force of habit .
i know a way .
i know a way .
but it' s really , really risky .
that' s where jack keeps it .
four hundred million in highly liquid u. s. bearer bonds .
so it' s a vault job .
go in after midnight , bypass security ... ... and ... power tools .
it' s a little simpler than that .
power tools ?
jack' s gonna have to take those bonds out of the safe deposit box .
that should be fun for him .
here' s my babies .
so , what' s he gonna do with the money ?
there it is , the grand cayman bank .
grand cayman .
what is this place ?
it' s where rich people go to evade taxes .
bastards .
honey .
they can' t hear us .
what' s next ?
mccallister takes the bonds to a representative ... ... who asks him for his signature to verify what they call " membership .
once the bonds are counted and confirmed ... ...
mccallister will receive a crm 114 deposit form ... ... and on this form he inputs his account number ... ... that only he and the bank know .
then the agent will take this ... ... to an authorization officer for further verification .
once the representative has stamped and initialed the document ... ... the account rep will take the crm 114 ... ... back to mccallister for final approval before finalization .
you said this was gonna be simple .
can you explain it again ?
jane doesn' t seem to understand .
jane , it' s simple .
it' s so simple .
jeez .
now , listen .
all we have to do ... ... is switch mccallister' s crm 114 with his account number ... ... with one of our own .
i' m so sorry .
a copy that we have made ... ... that has a number from an account that i have established .
and jack sends the 400 million to us without knowing it .
that' s ...
you got it .
it' s so simple .
that is beautiful .
it' s a switch .
it' s a switch .
it' s a switch .
it' s a switch .
that' s so sexy , man .
that' s unbelievable .
it' il be fun .
but jane' s gonna have to do it .
because if mccallister sees either one of us , he' il know something' s up .
and i ?
do nothing .
i can do that .
yeah .
okay .
you do it , then .
you' re the one .
yeah .
yeah .
you could do it , except ...
no , it' s good .
no , you do it .
you do it .
you do it .
you deserve to do it .
honey ...
are you ready to make the switch ?
do you have the form ?
it' s right here .
we should practice the move .
no , i got it .
okay , fine .
i won' t be involved .
i won' t participate at all .
you do it .
it' s all you .
let' s do one for good luck .
i got dressed up .
you' re not doing me any favors .

i just think it' s important .
that' s all .

and you be you .
hey .
hey !

no , no .
no !
sorry .
everybody ready ?

oh , let me guess , a fifth of scotch !
you son of a ...
wait .
stop it .
knock it off !
my god .
wait a second .
can we get another one ?
is that possible ?
how can we do that ?
you know what , i' m gonna take the car ... ... and i' m gonna try to delay mccallister .

because i don' t .
dick harper .
i' ve been terminated , bankrupted , deported and blackmailed ... ... because of you .
and i' m not leaving here without your money .
what you gonna do , dick ?
shoot me if i don' t approve that form ?
write me a check .
you are kidding me .
dick , it' s not gonna do us any good .
he' s just gonna cancel it the minute we walk out of here .
i don' t care .

i' m gonna need my hand back .
gladly .
all right .
yes , sir .
i' m gonna write you that check .
and what' s more , i' m not gonna cancel it .

and i admire that .

just a little something to show you what i think you' re worth .
y' all take care , now .
dick , honey ... ... give me the squirt gun , okay ?
do you still have mccallister' s form ?
why ?
because i just got his signature .
weren' t you an art major ?
dick harper !
i had no idea what you were doing .
i was completely fooled .
my god , i didn' t know you could act .
hon , in 10th grade i played biff in death of a salesman .
come on .
that' s just ...
see the way i got my eyes watering up ?
yes , sir .
it' s all right there .
i am married to a genius .
it' s a turn on , isn' t it ?
you' re a criminal .
i' m a hardened criminal .
hon , first we need to talk to spencer .

miss sheinkopf ?
miss sheinkopf , i' m gonna be home by 6 .
mr. mccallister !
jack !
mr. mccallister !
mr. mccallister !
we' re all waiting for you over here , jack .
everybody' s really pumped .
come on !
is this some kind of a joke , dick ?
are you still trying to get even with me ?
why would i get even with such a generous man ?
i still can' t believe you did that .
jane and i were way off base .
he' s on in 20 , right ?
hook him up .
wait , on what ?
sam samuels .
moneylife .
oh , and here are some suggested responses .
live to southern california , where ... ... in a stunning act of personal generosity , jack mccallister ...
who the hell do you think you are ?
i' m your vp of communications , jack . personally funded the defunct corporation' s pension fund .
you said i just did what ?
god , i love this guy .
but seriously , jack , what made you do it ?
well , i ...
sam , i ...
i realized , sam , that since the employees of globodyne ... ... had given me so much , it was time for me to give back to them .
so yesterday , i wire transferred ... ... $400 million ... ... into the newly created globodyne pension relief fund .
oh , yeah !
let' s look at what happened when the first ex globodyne employees ... ... received their shares of money .
many people had their life savings invested in the company ... ... and were delighted to learn their pensions had been returned .
it is the first time in u. s. corporate history ... ... that a ceo has personally funded a bankrupted pension plan .
this incredible gesture won' t soon be forgotten by the people ... ... whose lives it has so dramatically affected .
and this is just the beginning .
in the coming months , thousands more will be receiving a check ... ... for the full value of their lost pensions and life savings .
jack , jack , he' s got your back !
jack , jack , he' s got your back !
jack , jack , he' s got your back !
you hear that ?
they love you , jack .
now , go to hell .
mr. mccallister ... ... do you consider yourself a modern day robin hood ?
does this mean you' re off the hook ?
do you wanna save the whales ?
now , hang on a minute .
have you decided to contribute to the homeless ?
what made you so gracious ?
mr. mccallister , how do you feel right now ?
mr. mccallister , how about giving a brother a buck ?
look at our beautiful family .
my name is dick harper .
i agree .
hey , harpers , stick them up !
look who it is .
hey , garth .
how you doing , garth ?
great .
hey , how do you like the new wheels ?
nice .
hooked up with a new company .
great benefits .
yeah ?
yeah .
they trade energy .
it' s called enron .
