' whenever i get gloomy with the state of the world ,
' i think about the arrivals gate at heathrow airport .
' general opinion makes out that we live in a world of hatred and greed
' but i don' t see that .
' seems to me that love is everywhere .
' often it' s not particularly dignified or newsworthy but it' s always there .
' fathers and sons , mothers and daughters , husbands and wives ,
' boyfriends , girlfriends , old friends .
' when the planes hit the twin towers ,
' none of the phone calls from people on board were messages of hate or revenge ,
' they were all messages of love .
' lf you look for it , i' ve got a sneaky feeling you' il find that love actually is all around . '
i feel it in my fingers
i feel it in my toes
feel it in my toes , yeah
love is all around me and so the ...
i' m afraid you did it again , bill .

i feel it in my fingers in my fingers
i feel it in my toes

i feel it in my toes

that is so inconvenient .
in the presence of god , peter and juliet have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other .
they' ve declared their marriage by the giving of rings .
i therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife .
and you resisted the temptation for surprises .
yeah , i' m mature now .
love , love , love
love , love , love
love , love , love ...
did you do this ?
er , no .
love , love , love , love
there' s nothing you can do that can' t be done
oh , it ...
there' s nothing you can sing that can' t be sung
there' s nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
it' s easy
all you need is love
all you need is love
all you need is love , love
love is all you need ...
look , it' s pikey .
hello !

oh , i just popped over to borrow some old cds .

i thought i' d pop back and see if she' s better .
this is good .
oh .

i think we ought to take mum out for her birthday on friday .
what do you think ?
i just feel we' ve been bad sons this year .
sounds fine .
a bit boring but fine .
hurry up , big boy !
i' m naked and i want you at least twice before jamie gets home .
i am so happy to see you !
delicious delicacy ?
er , no , thanks .

yeah , a bit dodgy , isn' t it ?
looks like a dead baby' s finger .
oooh .

i' m colin , by the way .
i' m nancy .
wicked .
what do you do , nancy ?
i' m a cook .
ever do weddings ?
yes , i do .
they should' ve asked you to do this one .
they did .
god , i wish you hadn' t have turned it down .
i didn' t .
right .
i' ve worked out why i can' t find true love .
why is that ?
english girls .
they' re stuck up , you see .
and i am primarily attractive to girls who are cooler , game for a laugh .
like american girls .
so i should just go to america !
i' d get a girlfriend there instantly .
what do you think ?
i think it' s crap , colin .
that' s where you' re wrong .
american girls would dig me with my cute british accent .
you don' t have a cute british accent .
yes , i do !
i' m going to america .
colin , you' re a lonely , ugly arsehole .
accept it .
never .
i am colin , god of sex .
i' m just on the wrong continent , that' s all .
bit of quiet while we finish the lighting , guys !
the traffic today was just ...
unbelievable .
judy , could you take the top off this time ?
lighting need to know when we' re gonna see the , erm , nipples and when we' re not .
yes , ok .
right .
at least it' s nice and warm in here .
not always the case , is it ?
i was standing in for brad pitt once on seven years in tibet ...
yes , yeah .
bloody freezing ...
guys , time' s tight and we have to get the actors in .
fine .
i promise i won' t look .
right , let' s have another look at that , please .
can you just put your hands on her breasts ?
ok , yeah .
is that all right ?
yes .
i' il warm them up !
and massage them , please .
right .
it' s junction 13 that' s just murder , isn' t it ?
total gridlock this morning .
jo and i had a lot of time to prepare for this moment .
some of her requests , for instance , that i should bring claudia schiffer as my date to the funeral ,
i was confident she expected me to ignore .
but others she was pretty damn clear about .
when she first mentioned what' s about to happen ,
i said , " over my dead body .
and she said , " no , daniel , over mine .
and as usual , my darling girl ... and sam' s darling mum was right .
so she' s going to say her final farewell to you not through me but , inevitably , ever so coolly , through the immortal genius of the bay city rollers .
bye bye baby , baby goodbye
goodbye baby , baby bye bye
bye bye baby
don' t make me cry goodbye baby , baby bye bye
you' re the one girl in town i' d marry
girl i' d marry you now if i were free
i wish it could be
i could love you but why begin it ?
cos there ain' t any future in it
she' s got me but i' m not free so ... bye bye baby , baby goodbye goodbye baby , baby bye bye bye bye baby , don' t make me cry goodbye baby , baby bye bye wish i never had known you ...
do you love him ?
er , er , what ?
no , l i just thought i' d ask bluntly in case it was the right question and you needed someone to talk to about it and no one had ever asked you .
no .
no .
no is the answer .
absolutely not . .. on my finger ...
so that' s a no , then ?
yes .
erm ... bye bye baby , baby goodbye goodbye baby , baby bye bye ...
this dj , what do you reckon ?
the worst in history ?
probably .
i think it all hangs on the next song .
now here' s one for the lovers .
that' s quite a few of you , i shouldn' t be surprised and a half .
puppy love ) and they called it ...
he' s done it , it' s official .
worst dj in the world . oh , i guess they' il never know ...
sarah' s waiting for you .
oh , yes , of course , erm ...
great , er , good , good .
how are you doing , mia ?
settling in fine ?
learning who to avoid ?
absolutely .
harry ?
sarah , switch off your phone and tell me exactly how long it is that you' ve been working here .
two years , seven months , three days and , i suppose , what , two hours ?
and how long have you been in love with karl , our enigmatic chief designer ?
um ...
two years , seven months , three days and , i suppose , an hour and 30 minutes .
thought as much .
do you think everybody knows ?
yes .
do you think karl knows ?
yes .
oh , that is ... that is bad news .
i just thought that maybe the time had come to do something about it .
like what ?
lnvite him out for a drink then casually mention you' d like to marry him and have lots of sex and babies .
you know that ?
yes .
and so does karl .
think about it , for all our sakes .
it' s christmas .
certainly .
excellent .
will do .
thanks , boss .
hi , sarah .
hi , karl .
christmas is all around )
babe .
absolutely , fire away .
mia , mia , would you turn that down ?
what is that ?
that was the christmas effort from the once great billy mack .
oh , dear me , how are the mighty fallen .
i can safely say that is the worst record i' ve heard this century ...
oh , and coincidentally , i believe billy will be a guest on my friend mike' s show in a few minutes ' time .
welcome back , bill .
billy , welcome back to the airwaves .
new christmas single , cover of love is all around .
except we' ve changed the word " love " to " christmas " .
yes , is that an important message to you , bill ?
not really , mike .
christmas is a time for people with someone they love in their lives .
and that' s not you ?
that' s not me , michael .
when i was young and successful , i was greedy and foolish and now i' m left with no one , wrinkled and alone .
wow .
thanks for that , bill .
for what ?
for actually giving a real answer to a question .
it doesn' t often happen here at radio watford , i can tell you .
ask me anything , i' il tell you the truth .
best shag you ever had ?
britney spears .
wow .
no , only kidding !
she was rubbish .
ok , here' s one .
how do you think the new record compares to your old , classic stuff ?
come on , mikey , you know as well as i do the record' s crap .
but wouldn' t it be great if number one this christmas wasn' t some smug teenager but an old ex heroin addict searching for a comeback at any price ?
those young popsters come christmas will be stretched out naked with a cute bird balancing on their balls and i' il be stuck in some dingy flat with me manager joe , ugliest man in the world , fucking miserable because our fucking gamble didn' t pay off .
so if you believe in father christmas , children , like your uncle billy does , buy my festering turd of a record .
and particularly enjoy the incredible crassness of the moment we try to squeeze an extra syilable into the fourth line .
i think you' re referring to
lf you really love christmas ...
come on and let it snow . " ouch .
so , here it is one more time , the dark horse for this year' s christmas number one ,
christmas is all around .
thank you , billy .
after this , the news .
is the new prime minister in trouble already ?
i feel it in my fingers i feel it in my toes
ok .
what' s next ?
the president' s visit .
ah , yes , yes .
i fear this is going to be a difficult one to play .
alex .
there' s a strong feeling in the party we mustn' t allow ourselves to be bullied
like the last government .
here , here .
this is our first really important test , let' s take a stand .
right .
right .
i understand that but i have decided ... not to .
not this time .
let' s not forget that america is the most powerful country in the world .
i' m not going to act like a petulant child .
who do you have to screw round here to get a cup of tea and a biscuit ?
right .
yeah , come in .
these are from the treasury ...
uh huh . .. and these are for you .
excellent .
thanks a lot .
i was hoping you' d win , not that i wouldn' t have been nice to the other bloke , just always given him the boring biscuits with no chocolate .
thanks very much .
thanks ...
natalie .
god , come on , get a grip .
you' re the prime minister , for god' s sake .
so what do you reckon to our new prime minister ?
oh , i like him .
i can' t understand why he' s not married , though .
you know the type , he' s married to his job .
either that or gay as a picnic basket .
excuse me , judy , if you could just lower the nipples
and cheat them a bit to the left ?
ok .
i have to say , judy , this is a real pleasure , it' s lovely to find someone i can actually chat to .
thank you !
oh , well , you know .
and ditto .
thank you .
the move again , please , judy .
ooh , sorry .
oh , god , sorry .
you all right ?
exciting news !
what ?
i' ve bought a ticket to the states .
i' m off in three weeks .
no .
yes !
to a fantastic place called wisconsin .
no !
yes !
wisconsin babes , here comes sir colin !
no , col !
there are a few babes in america , i grant you , but they' re going out with rich , attractive guys .
tone , you' re just jealous .
you know perfectly well that any bar anywhere in america contains ten girls more beautiful and more likely to have sex with me
than the whole of the united kingdom .
that is total bollocks .
you' re mad .
no , i' m wise .
stateside i am prince william without the weird family .
no , colin , no !
yes !
nyet !
da !
nein !
ja , darling !
right , the christmas party , not my favourite night of the year and your unhappy job to organise .
tell me .
it' s basic , really .
find a venue , over order on the drinks , bulk buy the guacamole and advise the girls to avoid kevin if they want their breasts unfondled .
wives and family and stuff ?
yeah .
i mean , not children .
but their wives and girlfriends , et cetera .
oh , christ , you haven' t got some horrible six foot , tight t shirt wearing boyfriend ?
no .
i' il just be hanging around the mistletoe , hoping to be kissed .
really ?
right .
he now spends all the time in his room .
i mean , he' il be up there now .
that' s not unusual .
my horrid son ...
bernard ?
bernard .
stays in his room all the time .
thank goodness .
yeah , but karen , this is all the time .
i' m afraid that there' s something really wrong , you know ?
i mean , clearly it' s about his mum but christ , he might be injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all i know .
at the age of 1 1 ?
well , maybe not his eyeballs , then .
maybe just his veins .
the problem is his mum always used to talk to him , you know , and ...
i don' t know , this whole stepfather thing seems suddenly to somehow matter
iike it never did before .
listen , it was always going to be a totally shit time .
just be patient .
and maybe check the room for needles .
and then when he sometimes does come out , it' s obvious he' s been crying .
it' s just such a ridiculous waste .
and now if it' s going to ruin sam' s life as well ...
i just don' t know .
get a grip .
people hate sissies .
no one' s ever gonna shag you if you cry all the time .
yeah .
absolutely .
helpful .
so , what' s the problem , samuel ?
is it just mum or is it something else , huh ?
maybe school ?
are you being bullied ?
or is it something worse ?
can you give me any clues at all ?
you really want to know ?
i really want to know .
even though you won' t be able to help ?
even if that' s the case , yeah .
ok .
well ... truth is , actually ...
i' m in love .
sorry ?
i know i should be thinking about mum and i am but i' m in love .
i was before she died and there' s nothing i can do about it .
aren' t you a bit young to be in love ?
no .
ah , well .
ok , well ...
i' m a little relieved .
why ?
because i ... thought it' d be something worse .
worse than the total agony of being in love ?
er ...
no , you' re right .
total agony .
night , sarah .
night , karl .
yeah , absolutely .
free as a bird .
fire away .
alone again .
naturally .
i' il deal with it .
mm .
ah .
natalie .
sir .
thanks .
natalie .
erm , i' m starting to feel ... uncomfortable about us working so closely every day and me knowing so little about you , it seems elitist and wrong .
well , there' s not much to know .
well , erm , where do you live , for instance ?
wandsworth .
the dodgy end .
ah , my sister lives in wandsworth .
oh .
so which exactly is the dodgy end ?
at the end of the high street , harris street , near the queen' s head .
oh , yeah , yeah , that is dodgy .
hm .
erm , and you live with your husband ?
boyfriend ?
three illegitimate but charming children ?
no .
i' ve just split up with my boyfriend , so i' m back with my mum and dad for a while .
ah .
sorry .
no , it' s fine .
i' m well shot of him .
he said i was getting fat .
i beg your pardon ?
he said no one' d fancy a girl with thighs the size of tree trunks .
not a nice guy , actually , in the end .
no .
you know , erm ... being prime minister , i could just have him murdered .
thank you , sir .
i' il think about it .
do .
the sas are absolutely charming .
ruthless , trained killers are just a phone call away .
oh , god .
did you have this kind of problem ?
yeah , course you did , you saucy minx .
so , let' s go .
we can definitely crack this .
remember , i was a kid once , too .
so , come on , it' s someone at school .
right ?
yeah .
uh huh .
good , good .
and what does she , he , feel about you ?
she doesn' t even know my name .
and even if she did , she' d despise me .
she' s the coolest girl in school .
and everyone worships her because she' s heaven .
good .
good .
well , basically you' re fucked , aren' t you ?
hi there and welcome back .
so , three weeks till christmas , looks like the real competition is gonna be blue .
i saw them on the show last week .
they weren' t very nice about my record .
no .
little scamps .
but very , very talented musicians .
yeah .
i understand you' ve got a prize for our competition winners .
yes , i have , ant or dec .
it' s a personalised felt tip pen .
oh , great .
it' s brilliant .
it even writes on glass , so if you' ve got a framed picture , like , for instance , this one of blue , you can just write on it .
er , a lot of kids watching , billy .
oh , yeah .
hiya , kids .
here' s an important message from your uncle bill don' t buy drugs .

and i do believe it' s a commercial break .
we' il see you soon .
bye bye . all i want for christmas is you
look at him !
eurh !
just a minute .
actually , they' re not funny .
they' re art .
ok , let' s say , er , thursday , my place .

i' m always ...
' mark ? '
hi .
how was the honeymoon ?
it was great .
thanks for the gorgeous sendoff .
so , what can i do for you ?
' it' s only a tiny favour . '
i' ve just tried the wedding video and it' s a disaster .
' it' s come out all blue and wibbly . '
i' m sorry .
i remember you filming a lot and i wondered if i could look at it .
to be honest , i didn' t really ...
please .
all i want is one shot of me in a wedding dress that isn' t turquoise .
i' il have a look but i' m pretty sure i wiped it , so don' t get any hopes up .
' must go . '
any progress with our matchmaking plans ?
no .
i' ve done fuck all and never will because he' s too good for me .
how true .
stop .
and of course , your mobile goes .
hello .
hi .
how you doing ?
so , how' s the christmas party going ?
good .
think i' ve found a venue .
what' s it like ?
good .
good .
it' s an art gallery .
full of dark corners for doing dark deeds .
oh .
right .
good .
well , i suppose i should take a look at it or something .
you should .
ah , bonjour , eleonore .
bonjour , monsieur bennett .
welcome back .
and this year you bring a lady guest ?
no .
there' s a change of situation .
just me .
oh .
am i sad or not sad ?
i think you' re not surprised .
and you stay here till christmas ?
yeah , yeah .
good .
well , i find you a perfect lady to clean the house .
this is aurelia .
ah .
er , bonjour , aurelia .
bonjour .
er , je suis , er , trs heureux de vous avoir ici .
unfortunately , she cannot speak french , just like you .
she' s portuguese .
ah , ah , buongiorno .
eusebio , er , er ... er , molto bueno ...
i think she' s ten years too young to remember a footballer called eusebio .
and " molto bueno " is spanish .
right .
anyway , it' s nice to meet you and ...
can you drive her home after her work ?
oh , absolutely , yes .
con con grande , er , pl plesura .
which is what ?
turkish ?
bello .
er , bella .
er , mon montagno , arvarez ...
no , right .
silence is golden .
as the tremeloes said .
clever guys , although i think the original version was by frankie valli and the four seasons .
gr great band .
silence is golden )
oh , shut up .
mr president !
over here , sir !
what will you be talking about ?
mr president , welcome .
it' s a pleasure to meet you .
come through .
i' m sorry your wife couldn' t make it .
so is she .
although she would have been kind of lonely .
yes .
pathetic , isn' t it ?
just never been able to tie a girl down .
not sure that politics and dating go together .
really ?
i' ve never found that .
yeah , you' re still sickeningly handsome , whereas i look like my aunt mildred .
very jealous of your plane , by the way .
thank you .
we love that thing .
ah , natalie .
hi .
morning , ma' am .
how' s your day so far ?
excellent .
my goodness , that' s a pretty little son of a bitch .
did you see those pipes ?
yeah , she' s terrific .
at her job .
no , absolutely not .
we cannot and will not consult on that either .
that is unexpected .
well , it shouldn' t be .
the last administration made it perfectly clear .
we' re being consistent with their policies .
with all respect , they were bad policies .
thanks , alex .
i don' t think we' re making progress here .
let' s , erm ... move on , shall we ?
well , now , that was an interesting day .
sorry if our line was firm but there' s no point in tiptoeing around today , then just disappointing you for four years .
i have plans and i plan to see them through .
absolutely .
there is one final thing to look at .
it' s very close to my heart .
just give me a second .
i' il give you anything you ask for .
as long as it' s not something i don' t wanna give .
hi .
pathetic .
it' s great scotch .
i' il , erm ...
i' il be going , then .
er , natalie ,
i hope to see much more of you as our countries work toward a better future .
thank you , sir .
er , yes , peter .
mr president , has it been a good visit ?
very satisfactory indeed .
we got what we came for and our special relationship is still very special .
prime minister ?
i love that word " relationship " .
covers all manner of sins , doesn' t it ?
i fear that this has become a bad relationship .
a relationship based on the president taking what he wants and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to , erm ...
britain .
we may be a small country but we' re a great one , too .
the country of shakespeare , churchill , the beatles ,
sean connery , harry potter .
david beckham' s right foot .
david beckham' s left foot , come to that .
and a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend .
and since bullies only respond to strength , from now onward ,
i will be prepared to be much stronger .
and the president should be prepared for that .
mr president !
joe .
it' s your sister on line four .
all right .
er , yes , i' m very busy and important , how can i help you ?
have you gone completely insane ?
you can' t always be sensible .
' you can if you' re prime minister . '
it' s the chancellor on the other line .
it isn' t !
' i' il call you back . '
no , you won' t !
the trouble with being the prime minister' s sister is it puts your life into perspective .
what did my brother do today ?
he fought for his country .
what did i do ?
i made a papier mch lobster head .
what is this we' re listening to ?
joni mitchell .
i can' t believe you still listen to joni mitchell .
i love her and true love lasts a lifetime .
joni mitchell is the woman who taught your cold english wife how to feel .
did she ?
oh , well , that' s good , i must write to her and say thanks .
which doll for daisy' s friend emily ?
the one that looks like a transvestite or the one that looks like a dominatrix ?
' it' s almost enough to make you feel patriotic ,
' so here' s one for our arse kicking prime minister .
' a golden oldie for a golden oldie . '
jump ) hold me i' il give you all that you need wrap your love around me you' re so excited i can feel you getting hotter oh baby i' il take you down , i' il take you down where no one' s ever gone before and if you want more if you want more , more , more jump for my love jump in and feel my touch jump , if you wanna taste my kisses in the night then jump for my love i' il take you down , i' il take you down where no one' s ever gone
yeah , erm ,
mary , can we move the japanese ambassador to four o' clock tomorrow ?
certainly , sir .
terrific .
