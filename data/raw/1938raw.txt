in our relations with other people , we mainly discuss and evaluate their character and behavior .
that is why i have withdrawn from nearly all so called relations .
this has made my old age rather lonely .
my life has been full of hard work , and i am grateful .
it began as toil for bread and butter and ended in a love for science .
i have a son , also a doctor , who lives in lund .
he has been married for many years .
they have no children .
my old mother is still alive and is very active , in spite of her age .
my wife karin has been dead for many years .
dinner is served , professor borg .
thank you .
i am lucky in having a good housekeeper .
perhaps i should add that i am an old pedant , which at times has been rather trying for myself and those around me .
my name is isak borg , and i am 78 .
tomorrow i shall receive an honorary degree in lund cathedral .
wi ld strawberri es
in the early hours ofjune 1 st ,
i had a weird and very unpleasant dream .
i dreamt that during my morning walk
i lost my way among empty streets with ruined houses .
are you ill ?
miss agda , please prepare some breakfast .
i' m taking the car .
please , professor !
go back to bed and i' il bring you coffee at 9 : 00 , and we' il leave at 10 : 00 as planned .
oh , well , i' il go without breakfast .
and who will pack your tails ?
i will do it myself .
and what about me ?
you can come in the car or fly .
please yourself .
i' ve looked forward to seeing you get your honorary degree .
and we had arranged everything so nicely , and now you' re taking the car .
the ceremony isn' t until 5 : 00 .
if i leave at once , i' ve got 14 hours before the ceremony .
you' il ruin everything !
what about your son who is expecting you at the airport in malm ?
you can think up an explanation .
if you go by car , i won' t come at all .
now listen , miss agda !
take the car , and you' il ruin the greatest day of my life .
we' re not married , miss agda .
i thank god for that every night .
i' ve used my common sense for 74 years , and it won' t let me down now .
is that your last word ?
yes .
but i shall say plenty to myself about selfish , crabby old men who never think of those who have served them faithfully for 40 years .
incredible that i have put up ... with your bossing for so long .
just give the word , and i' il leave tomorrow .
i' m going by car anyway , and you can do as you damn well please .
i happen to be grown up and needn' t take orders from you .
no one can pack like you , miss agda .
really ?
old sourpuss .
shall i boil you a couple of eggs ?
yes , please , if you will be so extremely kind .
the faculty should have made me honorary idiot .
i' il calm the old girl down with a present .
i hate resentful people .
i wouldn' t hurt a fly , let alone miss agda .
toast ?
no , don' t trouble yourself on my account .
what are you cross about ?
don' t you want a cup ?
good morning , uncle isak .
well , well , why is my daughter in law up at this hour ?
who can sleep when you and aunt agda are making such a row ?
there has been no row .
no , not at all .
you' re taking the car to lund ?
yes .
can i come with you ?
you' re going home ?
yes , i want to go home .
home to evald ?
you don' t need to ask why .
i would take the train if i could afford it .
of course you may ride with me .
i' il be ready in ten minutes .
good heavens !
please don' t smoke .
i can' t stand cigarette smoke .
i forgot .
there should be a law forbidding women to smoke .
beautiful weather .
yes , but sultry .
i think we' il have a thunderstorm .
so do i.
no , give me a cigar anytime .
that' s stimulating and relaxing .
that' s a vice for men .
and what vices may a woman have ?
weeping , giving birth and speaking ill of her neighbors .
how old are you really , uncle isak ?
why do you ask ?
no reason .
why ?
i know why you asked .
oh , well .
don' t pretend .
you don' t like me .
you never have .
i only know you as a father in law .
why are you going home ?
on impulse .
nothing more .
evald happens to be my son .
so he is .
evald and i are very much alike .
we have our principles .
you don' t need to tell me that .
now , this loan , for instance .
i know exactly what you' re going to say .
he should have paid it back when he became an associate professor .
it' s a matter of honor for him to pay back 5, 000 a year , and so on , and so on .
a promise is a promise .
for us , it means that we never can be free together , and that your son works himself to death .
you have your own income .
especially when one considers the fact that you' re filthy rich and don' t need the money .
a promise is a promise .
and i know evald respects that .
perhaps .
but he also hates you .
what do you have against me ?
shall i be frank ?
yes , i' m asking you .
you' re a selfish old man , uncle isak .
you' re utterly ruthless and never listen to anyone but yourself .
but you hide it all behind your old world manners and charm .
beneath your benevolent exterior , you' re as hard as nails .
but you can' t fool us who have seen you at close quarters .
remember when i came to you a month ago ?
i had a stupid idea that you might help evald and me .
so i asked to stay with you for a week or two .
remember what you answered ?
i said i' d be delighted .
perhaps you' ve forgotten , but you said , don' t try to draw me into your marital squabbles .
i don' t give a damn .
you and evald must make the best of it .
did i say that ?
not only that .
oh , no .
these were your very words : i have no respect for mental suffering , so don' t come lamenting to me .
if you need therapy , you' d better see a shrink .
or why not a minister ?
it' s in fashion now .
did i say that ?
your judgments are very categorical , uncle isak .
i should hate to depend on you .
i have liked having you about the house .
like a cat .
a cat or a human being .
you' re a fine young woman , and i' m sorry you dislike me .
i don' t dislike you .
really ?
i feel sorry for you .
sorry ?
i' d like to tell you about a dream i had this morning .
i' m not very interested in dreams .
no .
no , of course not .
where are you going now ?
i want to show you something .
we lived here every summer during the first 20 years of my life .
there were ten of us children .
perhaps you knew that .
does anyone live here now ?
no , not this summer .
i' il go swimming , if you don' t mind .
we have plenty of time .
yes , by all means , do .
the place where wild strawberries grow !
perhaps i got a little sentimental .
perhaps i got a little tired and felt a bit sad .
it ' s not impossible that i began to think of this and that , associated with places where i played as a child .
i don ' t know how it happened , but the day ' s clear reality dissolved into the even clearer images of memory that appeared before my eyes with the strength of a true stream of events .
sara .
sara , it' s your cousin isak .
well , i' ve become quite old , of course , so i don' t look the same .
but you , you haven' t changed at all .
good morning , sweet cousin .
what are you doing ?
picking strawberries , silly .
can' t you see ?
and who shall be favored with these delicious berries picked in the early morn by a lovely young woman ?
nonsense .
you know quite well that it' s uncle aron' s name day today .
i forgot to make a present .
so he' il get a basket of wild strawberries instead .
i' il help you .
you see , sigbritt and charlotta made a tapestry and angelica baked a cake , and anna has painted a really good picture , and kristina and birgitta wrote a song that they' il sing to him .
that' s the best one .
uncle aron is stone deaf .
he' il be very pleased , and you' re stupid .
and you have a darned cute nape .
you know you shouldn' t do that .
says who ?
i say .
besides , you' re an unusually insufferable young man who thinks he' s really something .
i' m your cousin , and you' re in love with me .
with you !
come and be kissed on the lips .
if you don' t behave , i' il tell isak you' re always trying to kiss me .
little isak !
i could beat him up with one arm .
you know quite well that isak and i are secretly engaged .
so secretly , everyone knows it .
it' s not my fault that the twins let the cat out of the bag .
when is the wedding ?
when is the wedding ?
i don' t know which of you four brothers is the least conceited , but i think it' s isak .
isak is the nicest , anyway .
and you' re the horridest , nastiest , silliest , stupidest ...
i can' t find the words to describe you !
admit you' ve got a weak spot for me .
and you reek of cigars .
it' s a nice manly smell .
and the twins , who know most things , say you' ve been up to no good with that berglund girl .
she' s not a nice girl , the twins say .
and i agree .
how pretty you are when you blush .
you must kiss me .
i can' t bear it any longer .
now that i think of it , i' m madly in love with you .
you' re just saying that .
no .
and the twins say that you' re mad about girls .
is that true ?
oh , look what you' ve done !
and what will isak say , who really loves me ?
i' m so sad !
you' ve hurt me so !
you' ve made a bad woman of me .
at any rate , nearly .
i never want to see you again , at least not before brunch .
i have to hurry .
help me pick up the strawberries .
oh , and now i' ve got a stain on my apron !
where' s isak ?
out fishing with papa , and they can' t hear the gong .
anyway , papa said not to wait with brunch .
in jesus ' name we take our seat .
bless , o lord , this food we eat .
amen .
benjamin , go and wash your hands at once .
how old do you have to be to learn cleanliness ?
i have .
sigbritt , pass angelica the porridge .
your fingernails are filthy .
hagbart , pass the bread .
don' t take so much butter .
charlotta , the salt is lumpy .
you let it get damp .
how often have i told you not to let it sit out ?
it' s paint under my nails .
who gathered the wild strawberries for me ?
i did .
what ?
speak up , dear .
uncle aron can' t hear .
i did !
fancy your remembering my name day .
how kind of you .
couldn' t uncle have a drink to celebrate ?
never when papa is not at home .
uncle has already had three drinks .
we saw him when we went out to bathe at 8 : 00 .
so you' ve picked berries too .
thank you .
twins , speak when spoken to .
and as you didn' t make your beds , you can dry the silver .
you will do as auntie says .
benjamin , don' t bite your nails .
anna , what are you doing ?
remember you' re not a little girl anymore .
i want to give uncle my picture .
please , auntie , can' t we give him our presents now ?
where is your present ?
under the table .
no , after we' ve eaten .
fritjof and ingeborg .
you can' t tell which is fritjof !
what were sara and sigfrid doing in the wild strawberry patch ?
we saw you !
we saw you !
the twins ought to be muzzled .
the twins will be quiet or leave the table .
no freedom of speech , eh ?
shut up , you brats .
sara' s blushing !
sara' s blushing !
sigfrid is blushing too !
sigfrid and sara !
sigfrid and sara !
quiet , everybody !
but sara !
they' re lying !
they' re lying !
isak is so fine and good , so moral and sensitive .
he wants us to read poetry and talk about the next life and play four handed piano .
and he only wants to kiss in the dark , and he talks about sin .
he' s on such a terribly high level , and i feel so worthless .
and i am worthless ... there' s no denying it .
but sometimes it seems to me that i' m a lot older than isak , if you know what i mean .
and then i think he' s a child , although we' re the same age .
and sigfrid is so bold and exciting , and i want to go home .
i don' t want to be here all summer and be an object of ridicule for the twins and all of you .
i don' t want to !
i' il speak to sigfrid .
if he doesn' t behave ,
i' il make sure he' s made to study during the summer holidays .
papa will fix that as easy as anything .
he too thinks sigfrid is a good for nothing and needs to work .
poor little isak who' s so good to me .
how unfair everything is .
all will be well , you' il see .
listen , now they' re singing for uncle aron .
how silly to write a song for a deaf old man .
how typical of the twins .
f lowers nod , grasses bow
around our lovely house
we our uncle aron celebrate
and with our song
ornament his brow
four cheers for uncle aron .
hurrah , hurrah , hurrah , hurrah !
i' il run down and meet isak and uncle .
you do that .
i was overwhelmed by feelings of emptiness and sadness , but was soon awakened from my reveries by the voice of a young girl asking me repeatedly about something .
is this your house ?
no , it' s not .
you' re lucky to be telling the truth .
it' s my dad who owns the whole headland , including the house .
i lived here once .
two hundred years ago .
oh , yeah ?
is that your car up at the gate ?
yes , that' s my car .
looks antique .
yes , it' s antique , like its owner .
so you have self irony too .
that' s fantastic .
where are you going ?
i mean , in which direction ?
well , i' m going to lund .
but that suits me perfectly .
you see , i' m on my way to italy .
i' m honored .
my name' s sara .
silly name , isn' t it ?
my name' s isak .
it' s silly too .
weren' t they married ?
no , unfortunately .
that was abraham and sara .
let' s leave , then .
i have another lady with me .
here she comes .
marianne , this is sara .
hello .
we' re going to have company as far as lund .
sara' s off to italy , but she' s promised to ride a ways with us .
ironic again , but it suits you .
let' s be off .
hey , guys , i' ve got a lift almost to italy .
that' s anders and that' s viktor and this is father isak .
that peach you' re gaping at is marianne .
what a big bus .
yes , there' s room for us all .
put your luggage in the trunk , if you don' t mind .
i must tell you , isak , that anders and i are going steady .
we' re crazy about each other .
viktor' s the chaperone .
daddy insisted .
viktor is in love with me too .
it' s a brilliant move of daddy' s .
i may have to seduce viktor to get rid of him .
i' d better tell you i' m a virgin .
that' s why i' m so cheeky .
and i smoke a pipe .
viktor says it' s good for you .
he' s crazy about anything healthy .
i was once in love with a woman called sara .
no !
she was like me , wasn' t she ?
she was , actually .
what happened to her ?
she married my brother sigfrid and had six children .
she' s 75 now and quite a beautiful old lady .
i can' t think of anything worse than growing old .
oh , dear , now i have put my foot in it .
are you all right ?
i have no excuse .
it' s all our fault .
my wife was driving .
are you all right ?
the murderers must introduce themselves !
my name' s alman .
that' s my wife berit .
you can see she has been an actress .
that' s the complication we were discussing when ...
come here , berit , and say you' re sorry .
i' m so sorry .
it was all my fault .
i was just going to hit my husband when that curve appeared .
god punishes some people at once , eh , you catholic ?
let' s get your car upright .
oh , never mind us .
please .
shut up , sten .
some people are unselfish , though you don' t think so .
my wife is a little nervous .
we' ve had a shock .
just look at him measuring his strength with the youngsters , straining his flabby muscles to show off in front of that cute girl .
darling , you might have a stroke .
my wife likes ridiculing me .
i let her .
it' s psychotherapy .
i never know whether my wife is really crying or just playacting .
i' il be damned if it isn' t real .
it happens when you catch a glimpse of death .
can' t you shut up ?
my wife can really live a part .
for two years , she made me think she had cancer and plagued us with every possible symptom , even though the doctors could find nothing wrong with her .
eventually we believed her more than the doctors !
it' s natural that you' re upset , but why not leave your wife in peace for a while ?
a woman has a right to her tears , eh ?
don' t get in the way of a woman' s tears .
you are beautiful , but old berit' s a bit past her prime .
so you can afford to defend her .
i sympathize with her .
for several reasons .
very sarcastic !
yet you don' t seem in the least hysterical .
but little berit is .
do you know what that means for me ?
i gather you' re a catholic .
quite right .
that' s how i stand it .
we ridicule each other .
she has her hysteria .
i have my catholicism .
so , you see , we need each other .
it' s only egoism that we haven' t killed each other .
there it came .
that' s what is called syncopes , isn' t it ?
very funny .
if i' d had a stopwatch , i could have timed the explosion .
shut up !
shut up !
this may be too blunt , but for the children' s sake , will you please get out .
forgive us , if you can .
it was with mixed feelings i saw this region again .
i had my first practice here , and my old mother lives nearby .
hello there , doctor .
so you' re in these parts again , doctor ?
shall i fill it up ?
pass me the key to the hood .
eva !
come here a moment !
it' s dr. borg in person .
mom and dad and the whole countryside still talk about him .
the world' s best doctor .
let' s call the baby after him .
isak akerman ... not a bad name for a prime minister .
suppose it' s a girl .
we only have boys .
and how' s your father these days ?
oh , dad' s getting a bit decrepit .
but mom' s as lively as a cricket .
and you' re going to see your mother , doctor ?
she' s amazing .
she must be at least 95 .
ninety six .
imagine that .
what do i owe you ?
this is on eva and me !
absolutely not !
don' t insult us , doctor .
we can do the proper thing too !
why should you pay for my gasoline ?
there are things that can ' t be paid back ... not even with gas .
we haven' t forgotten .
ask anyone around here .
they all remember your kindness .
maybe i should have stayed here .
what do you mean ?
you said you should have stayed .
did i ?
well , thanks anyway .
let me know when the new son arrives , and i' il be the godfather .
you know where to find me .
during lunch i was in good spirits and told the young people about my years as district medical officer .
my stories were quite a success , and i don ' t think they laughed merely out of courtesy .
i had wine with the lunch , and then port with the coffee .
ah , when creation shows so much beauty , how radiant must be its source !
he is going to be a minister , and viktor a doctor .
reciting poetry is against our agreement not to discuss god or science on this trip .
it was beautiful !
how can anyone today study to become a minister !
your rationalism is as dry as dust .
i say that modern man ...
i say that ... believes only in himself and his biological death .
modern man is a figment of your imagination .
man regards death with horror .
religion for the people .
opium for the aching limb .
how sweet they both are !
i always agree with the one i spoke with last .
once you believed in santa claus ... now in god .
you never had any imagination !
what do you say , professor ?
whatever i said would be met with tolerant irony , so i' il say nothing .
i' m sure they' il be disappointed .
no , sara .
very , very happy .
where is the friend i seek at break of day ?
when night falls , when ... " when night falls , i still have not found him . " my burning heart shows me his traces ...
are you religious , professor ?
i see his traces wherever flowers bloom .
his love is mingled with every air . " his voice calls in the summer wind .
not bad for a love poem .
i' ve gone all solemn again for no reason .
well , i' m going to call on my mother .
i' il be back soon .
may i come ?
of course .
here comes the thunder .
i have just sent you a telegram on your great day .
and now you' re here .
we all have our bright moments , dear mother .
is that your wife over there ?
i don' t want to talk to her .
she has done us too much harm .
no , mother dear .
this is evald' s wife , marianne .
well , let her come and say hello to me .
good day , mrs. borg .
and why are you gadding about like this ?
i have been in stockholm for a visit .
why aren' t you with evald and the child ?
evald and i have no children .
these young people nowadays !
i bore ten children .
will you please hand me that big box over there .
my mother lived in this house .
do you remember coming to see her , isak ?
very well .
here are some of your toys .
i have been trying to think which of you owned what .
ten children , and all dead except isak .
twenty grandchildren .
evald' s the only one who comes to see me .
don' t get me wrong ...
i' m not complaining .
fifteen great grandchildren whom i have never seen .
i send presents for all their birthdays .
i get letters of thanks , but nobody bothers to visit me unless they want to borrow money .
oh , i know i' m tiresome .
don' t think that , mother .
and i' ve one more fault .
i don' t die .
the inheritance isn' t being divided up the way these crafty young people had planned .
this was sigbritt' s doll .
she got it when she turned eight .
i made the dress myself .
but she never cared for it so it went to charlotta .
she took care of it ...
i remember it clearly .
do you see who that is ?
sigfrid was three and you were five .
and myself .
what a fright one looked in those days .
may i have it ?
by all means .
it' s only rubbish .
and here' s a coloring book .
i don' t know whose it was .
they' ve all put their names in it .
kristina has scrawled : i love papa more than anything in the whole world .
and birgitta has put : i' m going to marry papa .
isn' t that funny ?
i laughed when i saw it .
don' t you think it' s cold in here ?
no , not particularly .
i have felt cold all my life .
mostly my stomach .
i wonder why .
you have low blood pressure .
let us have some tea , and we can sit and talk .
no , thank you , mother .
we won' t disturb you any longer .
sigbritt' s eldest boy will soon be 50 .
i thought of giving him father' s gold watch .
it has no hands .
does that matter ?
i remember when sigbritt' s boy was a newborn .
he used to lie in the lilac arbor at the summer house .
now he' s turning 50 .
and little cousin sara used to carry him around and sing to him .
she married sigfrid , that good for nothing .
well , you must go now , or you' il be late for the ceremony .
i am very glad you came , and i hope to see you again .
give my love to evald .
good bye .
where are anders and viktor ?
they started arguing about god , and then they lost their tempers .
and anders tried to twist viktor' s arm , and viktor said that was a lousy argument for god' s existence .
i said they could talk about me instead .
then they told me to shut up because i didn' t understand the debate , so i left .
they went up the hill to fight it out because each insisted ... the other had hurt his innermost feelings .
where are they now ?
up there .
i' il see to them .
which one do you like best ?
which one do you like best ?
i don' t know .
anders is going to be a minister ...
he' s a darling .
but a minister' s wife ...
viktor' s nice too .
in a different way .
viktor will go far , of course .
what do you mean ?
a doctor earns more money .
and ministers are out of date .
though he has got nice legs and a sweet neck .
but how can anyone believe in god ?
well ?
does god exist ?
i dozed off , but was haunted by vivid and humiliating dreams .
there was something overpowering in these dream images that bored relentlessly into my mind .
have you looked in the mirror , isak ?
then i' il show you what you look like .
you' re a worried old man who' s soon going to die , but i have all my life before me .
that hurt your feelings , after all .
no , it didn' t hurt .
yes , it hurt because you can' t bear the truth .
the truth is that i' ve been too considerate .
and so became unintentionally cruel .
i understand .
no , you don' t understand .
we don' t speak the same language .
look in the mirror again .
no , don' t turn away .
i see .
listen to me .
i' m going to marry your brother sigfrid .
love is almost a game for us .
look at your face now .
try to smile !
there !
now you' re smiling .
but it hurts so .
as professor emeritus , you ought to know why it hurts .
but you don' t know .
you know so much , and you don' t know anything .
i must go .
i promised to keep an eye on sigbritt' s baby .
poor little thing .
hush , baby .
sleep .
don' t be afraid of the wind or the birds or the waves of the sea .
i' m here with you , holding you tight .
don' t be afraid , little one .
it will soon be day again .
no one will hurt you .
i am with you .
i am holding you .
please come in , professor borg .
have you brought your examination book ?
please identify the bacterial specimen under the microscope .
there must be something wrong .
not with the microscope .
i can' t see a thing .
please read this text .
what does it mean ?
i don' t know .
really ?
i' m a doctor , not a linguist .
what you see on the blackboard is a doctor' s first duty .
don' t you know what that is ?
let me think .
take your time .
a doctor' s first duty ...
a doctor' s ...
i' ve forgotten .
a doctor' s first duty is to ask for forgiveness .
of course !
now i remember !
you have been accused of guilt .
i' il make a note that you haven' t understood the charge .
is it serious ?
unfortunately , professor .
i have a weak heart .
i' m an old man .
you must be lenient with me .
it' s only fair .
there' s nothing about your heart in my papers .
do you want to stop the examination ?
no , for god' s sake , no !
please diagnose the patient .
the patient is dead .
what are you writing in my book ?
my verdict .
and that is ?
that you are incompetent .
you are also accused of some minor but still serious offenses .
callousness , selfishness , ruthlessness .
your wife has made the charge .
you' il be confronted with her .
but my wife has been dead for years !
do you think i' m joking ?
please come with me .
you have no choice .
many forget a woman who has been dead for 30 years .
some cherish a sweet and fading picture , but you can recall this scene at any time .
tuesday , may 1 st , 1917 .
you stood on this very spot . and heard and saw what that man and woman said and did .
now i' il go home and tell isak .
i know just what he' il say . my poor girl , i' m sorry for you .
just as if he were god .
then i' il weep and say , do you really feel sorry for me ?
he' il say , yes , very sorry .
then i' il weep even more and ask him to forgive me .
he' il say , you mustn' t beg my forgiveness .
there is nothing to forgive .
but he doesn' t mean a word he says because he' s cold as ice .
and suddenly he gets very tender , and i scream at him that he' s mad and that his hypocrisy makes me sick .
then he says he' il get me a sedative and that he understands everything quite well .
and i tell him it' s his fault that i am as i am .
and he looks sad and says it is his fault .
but he doesn' t really care about anything because he' s so cold .
where is she ?
gone .
all are gone .
removed by an operation , professor .
a surgical masterpiece .
no pain .
nothing that bleeds or trembles .
how silent it is .
a perfect achievement in its way , professor .
and the punishment ?
i don' t know .
the usual , i suppose .
the usual ?
loneliness .
loneliness ?
precisely .
is there no mercy ?
don' t ask me .
i don' t know .
what' s this ?
the children wanted to stretch their legs .
but it' s still raining .
i told them about today and they want to honor you .
slept well ?
yes , but recently i' ve had the weirdest dreams ,
as if i must tell myself something i won' t listen to when i' m awake .
what' s that ?
that i' m dead .
although i' m alive .
you and evald are very alike .
so you' ve said .
he said the same thing .
about me ?
no .
about himself .
but he' s only 38 .
may i tell you about it ?
yes , i' d be grateful .
a few months ago i wanted to talk to evald , so he drove me down to the sea .
it was raining then too .
he sat where you sit now .
well , you' ve trapped me .
what do you want to say ?
something unpleasant , of course .
i wish i didn' t have to .
you have found someone else .
don' t be childish .
you tell me in funereal tones that you must talk to me , and then you find it hard to begin .
come on , for heaven' s sake !
don' t keep me on tenterhooks !
i almost want to laugh now .
whatever do you think i' m going to tell you ?
that i' ve killed someone , or stolen the faculty funds ?
i' m going to have a baby .
are you sure ?
the doctor told me yesterday .
so that was the secret .
i might as well tell you that i intend to have this child .
you' ve made up your mind ?
yes , i have .
you know i don' t want a child .
you' il have to choose between me and the child .
poor evald .
don' t poor evald " me !
it' s absurd to bring children into this world and think they' il be better off than we are .
that' s just an excuse .
call it what you want .
i was an unwanted child in a hellish marriage .
is he even sure i' m his son ?
that' s no excuse for behaving like this .
i must be at the hospital at 3 : 00 .
i have neither the time nor the desire to discuss this any further .
you' re a coward .
yes .
this life sickens me .
i will not be forced to take on a responsibility that will make me live for one day longer than i want to .
and you know that i mean what i say .
i know that this is wrong .
there' s neither right nor wrong .
we act according to our needs .
and what are they ?
yours is a hellish desire to live and to create life .
and yours ?
mine is to be dead .
stone dead .
if you want to smoke a cigarette , i don' t mind .
why have you told me all this ?
i saw you with your mother , and i was panic stricken .
i don' t understand .
that' s his mother .
an old woman , cold as ice , more forbidding than death .
and this is her son , and there are light years between them .
he himself says he' s a living corpse .
and evald is growing just as lonely , cold and dead .
and i thought of the baby inside me .
all along the line , there' s nothing but cold and death and loneliness .
it must end somewhere .
but you' re going back to evald !
to say i can' t agree to his conditions .
i want this child .
no one can take it from me .
not even the man i love most of all .
can i help you ?
no one can help me .
we are too old .
things have gone too far .
what happened after your talk ?
nothing .
i left him the next day .
hasn' t he gotten in touch with you ?
i don' t want us to get ...
to get what ?
like those two in the car today .
i was just thinking of them .
it reminded me of my own marriage .
but we love each other .
long may he live long may he live
may he live to be a hundred years old
we heard you' re celebrating a grand occasion today .
with these simple flowers we want to say that we are very impressed that you' ve been a doctor for 50 years .
we know you must be a very wise old man who knows everything about life and has learned all the instructions by heart .
thank you .
now we must go on .
it' s getting late .
so you did come .
evald and i had given up hope .
a nice drive is relaxing , isn' t it ?
you' il have to get into your tails at once .
good afternoon , marianne .
i' ve told evald you' re coming .
thank you .
that was most kind .
so you came after all , miss agda .
i considered it my duty .
but my pleasure' s been spoiled .
welcome , father .
as you see , i' ve brought marianne with me .
hello , marianne .
may i put my things upstairs ?
the guest room as usual , father ?
let me take your bag .
it' s rather heavy .
did you have a good trip ?
yes , it was pleasant .
who are those young people ?
i don' t know .
they' re nice , and they' re off to italy .
they seem nice .
yes , they' re very nice .
it' s a quarter past 4 : 00 .
i' ve bought you new shoelaces .
i' m leaving tomorrow , so don' t worry .
are you going to a hotel ?
no , why ?
can' t we share the bedroom for one more night ?
unless you object .
give me a hand unpacking ?
it' s nice to see you .
and unexpected .
same here .
are we going on to the banquet afterwards ?
yes , i' il just call stenberg and tell him i' il have a lady with me .
hurry up , professor !
during the ceremony , my thoughts strayed to the day ' s events , and it was then i decided to write down what had happened .
in this jumble of events ,
i seemed to discern an extraordinary logic .
did you enjoy the ceremony ?
yes , thank you .
are you tired , miss agda ?
i won' t deny it .
take one of my sleeping pills .
miss agda , i am sorry about this morning .
are you ill , professor ?
no .
why ?
i don' t like the sound of it .
is it so rare for me to say i' m sorry ?
do you want the carafe on the table ?
thank you anyway , professor .
good night .
miss agda , as we have known each other for so many years , don' t you think we could call each other agda and isak ?
no , i don' t .
why not ?
have you brushed your teeth , professor ?
no intimacies for me , thank you .
it' s all right between us as it is .
but we are old now .
speak for yourself .
a woman is jealous of her reputation .
what would people think if we suddenly began to say agda and isak ?
they would make fun of us .
are you always right ?
almost always .
at our age , we should know how to behave .
good night , professor .
i' il leave the door ajar .
you know where i am if you want anything .
father isak !
you were splendid in the procession .
we were terribly proud to know you .
an old girl is giving us a lift all the way to hamburg .
anders is mad about her .
oh , be quiet .
we just wanted to say good bye .
good bye .
and thank you for your company .
it' s you i really love , you know .
today , tomorrow , always .
i' il remember .
come on .
we have to go now .
let me hear from you .
i think uncle is asleep .
evald !
yes , father ?
are you back already ?
marianne lost the heel on a shoe .
so you' re going to the dance ?
i suppose so .
how are you , father ?
excellent .
heart all right ?
excellent .
sleep well .
sit down a moment .
anything special ?
how is it to be between you and marianne ?
forgive my asking .
i don' t know .
it' s not my business , but ...
but wouldn' t it ...
i have asked her to stay with me .
shouldn' t you ...
i mean ...
i can' t live without her .
you mean alone ?
i can' t live without her .
that' s what i mean .
oh , i see .
it will be as she wants .
and she ...
she says she' il think about it .
about that debt of yours ...
don' t worry , you' il get your money .
that' s not what i meant .
how are you , uncle isak ?
fine .
just fine .
i lost a heel .
will these shoes do ?
they' re very nice .
thanks for coming with me .
i like you , marianne .
i like you too , uncle isak .
if i have been worried or sad during the day , it often calms me to recall childhood memories .
i did so on this evening too .
isak , there are no wild strawberries left .
auntie wants you to look for your papa .
we' il sail around and meet you at the other side of the island .
i can' t find either papa or mama .
come , i' il help you .
