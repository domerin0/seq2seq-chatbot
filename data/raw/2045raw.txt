i looked in the files ... until i found the name and address ofthe transplant recipient .

i thoughtyou were dead , bitch !

look , i' m sorry i wokeyou .

what doyou want ?

let me do the talking .
povidone iodine , approximation sutures ...
thrombocid , sterilized gauze and
you got any alcohol ?
no , i drank it all last night .
i mean for disinfecting .
no .
i' ve got vaseline , condoms and lots ofbandages .
anything else ?
alcohol , please .
oh , manolita !
the barceloneta !
those were the days !
you remember ?
yes .
please , don' t moveyour head .
you know anything about her ?
about who ?
lola ?
unfortunately .
what happened ?
i took her in .
she was in a bad way .
as usual , with all the shit she takes .
i came back from working the field all night ... and she' d cleaned the place out .
watches, jewelry , ' 70s magazines that were my inspiration .
300, 000 pesetas .
what hurt most was ... she took a statue ofthe virgin that my mother gave me .
what for ?
she doesn' t believe in anything !
unless she' s in a satanic sect and wanted it for some ritual .
i see she hasn' t changed .
to do that to me , with all she owes me !
since we met in paris 20 years ago , i' ve been like a sister to her .
we got our tits together .
you know better than anyone .
you never saw her again ?
no , and i don' t want to .
areyou looking for her ?
yes .
we' ve got unsettled business .
why did you go offlike that ?
won' tyou tell me anything ?
i can' t .
some other day .
all right .
just don' t disappear again .
i like to say good bye to the people i love ... even ifit' s only to cry my eyes out , bitch .
i can' t believe it .
i look like the elephant man !
don' t exaggerate .
it' sjust a bit swollen .
a bit swollen ?
where can i go with a mug like this ?
come and eat something .
why did you go to all this trouble ?
salad how wonderful !
it really hurts to chew !
i won' t be able to suck .
you shouldn' t work today .
what can i do ?
lola cleaned me out .
i have to work .
look , caramel spread !
and meat pie !
and myprovoleta .
i have to work too .
ifyou want , we can look together .
oh , yes !
sinceyou left , i haven' t had a decent meal .
well , also , as a model , i have to watch my figure .
the worst thing about this work is you' ve got to look cute ... and keep up with the latest advances in surgery and cosmetics .
you look terrific !
nothing like a chanel to makeyou feel respectable .
you look it .
don' t i look a bit ofa slut in this suit ?
all the better .
these nuns only help whores and transvestites .
is that a real chanel ?
no !
how could i buy a real chanel with all the hunger in the world !
all i have that' s real are my feelings ... and these pints ofsilicone that weigh a ton .
i feel so old , manolita , and it isn' t my age .
it' s because ofthe beating .
the beating i' ve taken for the last 40 years !
hello .
come in .
areyou looking for someone , or can i help ?
we want to see the girl who goes to the field .
the cute one .
sister rosa .
she' s inside .
go on in .
thankyou .
rosa , look .
visitors .
what happened toyour face ?
nothing .
a beating .
occupational hazard .
can we talk ?
ofcourse .
let' s go next door .
it' s quieter .
my friend and i want to quit the street ... but we need to work .
cleaning stairs , whatever .
we don' t care .
there isn' t much else .
well , garbage collector , or learning handicrafts here .
embroidered tablecloths , dried flowers .
i think i prefer garbage collector .
what can you do , apart from the street ?
i' ve worked as a cook .
she' s practically a surgeon .
look at this face .
she did it .
better than pitanguy .
she' s a compatriot of lola' s .
really ?
haveyou heard anything about her ?
i haven' t seen her in 1 8 years .
she cleaned out my place .
she was here .
it must have been about four months ago .
we helped her through detox .
i cared for her through withdrawal ... but then shejust disappeared .
i' d like to see her before i go to el salvador .
el salvador ?
maybe i' il sign on .
i always thought i could make it big in the third world .
then come with me .
i won' t be so alone .
the street' s getting worse here every day .
the whores were bad enough , but the drag queens are wiping us out .
i can' t stand the drag queens .
they' re sleazebags .
they confuse transvestism with a circus .
worse , with mime !
a woman is her hair , her nails ...
lips for sucking or for bitching .
i mean , haveyou ever seen a bald woman ?
i can' t stand them .
they' re all sleazebags !
i doubt there are many drag queens in el salvador ... but they' re in the middle ofa war .
yeah ?
i didn' t know that .
i' m replacing some nuns who were murdered .
i' m not sure what i need right now is a war .
you' re terrible , agrado .
soyou were a cook .
yes .
who ?
this one ?
the best !
what a surprise !
hi , mom .
are we interrupting ?
it doesn' t matter .
we seeyou so rarely .
this is manuela .
pleased to meetyou .
come inside .
don' tjust stand there .
mom , manuela is a cook ... and as florinda' s gone , i thought
thankyou , darling .
vicenta and i can manage .
but how ?
dad alone needs two people .
where is he ?
out with the dog .
on their own ?
ofcourse .
what ifthey get lost ?
the dog knows the way home .
don' t worry .
what a shame !
i reallywanted to see them .
we' il go look for them , but first we have to talk .
come into the studio .
i' m sorryyou came for nothing .
it' s all right .
try her for a few days .
think of dad .
manuela' s a nurse .
as well as a cook ?
yes .
i prefer to look afteryour father myself .
i understand .
thankyou anyway .
i' il go .
good bye .
manuela .
yes ?
wait here .
i won' t be long .
how dareyou bring a whore here !
it isn' t easy to find help who' il put up with you .
but a whore !
that' s no reason to be so rude .
i don' t like strangers to see me forging chagalls .
can' tyou understand ?
manuela isn' t a whore anymore .
she' s given it up .
how long haveyou known her ?
since this morning .
this morning ?
you' re incredible .
mywork is to help people ... even ifl' vejust met them .
well , mine isn' t .
don' t look at me like that .
it doesn' t mean i' m intolerant .
i' il makeyou a deal .
a deal ?
i' il give that woman a chance ifyou don' t go to el salvador .
mom , don' t give me any more doubts .
i' ve got enough .
and soyou should .
that trip is suicide !
no , it' s parricide !
well , i have to go .
manuela' s waiting .
sure !
anywhore , any salvadoran , is more important than your parents !
don' t start , mom .
you should go see a psychiatrist .
it wouldn' t do either ofus any harm .
didn' tyou want to see your father and the dog ?
another day .
areyou all right ?
good bye , mom .
hello , vicenta .
rosa , love .

i have always depended on the kindness ofstrangers .
i can' t drive .
nina does the driving .

no , thankyou .
i started smoking because of bette davis .
to imitate her .
at 1 8 , i was smoking like a chimney .
that' s why i called myself huma .
huma' s a very pretty name .
smoke is all there' s been in my life .
you' ve had success too .
success has got no taste or smell .
and when you get used to it , it' s as ifit didn' t exist .
god , where has that girl gone ?
i think that' s her !
you stay here .
i' il go .
he' s a son ofa bitch .

why did you lie to me ?
it was agrado' s idea .
the dress was hers too .
what' s this otherway for me to earn money ?
i' m dying ofcuriosity .
how much would you charge to rent me a room ?
to rentyou a room ?
why ?
i' m going to leave the center for a few months .
what about el salvador ?
i don' t feel well .
i can' t travel like this .
why doyou want to move in here ifyou' re ill ?
i' m pregnant .
pregnant ?
what areyou going to do ?
have it , ofcourse .
what doyou expect ?
i thought it' d be less ofa scandal here .
can' t the father helpyou out ?
the father !
god knows where he is .

what was your name ?
would you like to work for me ?
doing what ?
everything .
everything except sleep with me .
i' ve got enough with nina .
well , the truth is i was looking for ajob .
i need a personal assistant .
someone i can trust .
you don' t know me .
what i saw last night was enough .
but nina hates me .
nina hates everyone , including herselfand me .
well ... when do i start ?
right now , ifyou can .
all right .
ask nina what she wants for dinner .
i' il just have an esqueixada .
anything else ?
could you get a tranquilizer for nina ?
she' s real edgy today .
i' ve got lexatin .
terrific !
don' t mention the father .
why doyou dislike lola so much ?
lola' s got the worst ofa man ... and the worst ofa woman .
i' il tell you a story .
i had a friend who got married veryyoung .
after a year , her husband went to work in paris ... and he was to call her when he got settled .
twoyears passed .
the husband saved some money and came to barcelona to open a bar .
she came here tojoin him .
twoyears isn' t a long time ... but the husband had changed .
he didn' t love her anymore .
the change was more physical .
he' d gotten a pair oftits that were bigger than hers .
oh , i see .
my friend was veryyoung .
she was in a foreign land .
she had no one .
apart from the tits , the husband hadn' t changed that much ... so she ended up accepting him .
women will do anything to avoid being alone .
women are more tolerant , but that' s good .
we' re assholes ... and a bit lesbo .
listen to the end ofthe story .
my friend and her husband with the tits ... set up a bar here , on the barceloneta .
he spent the day in a tiny bikini , screwing everything he could ... and giving her a hard time ifshe wore a bikini ... or even a miniskirt .
the bastard !
how could someone act so macho with a pair oftits like that ?
sit down .
who is the patient ?
she is .
well ?
my sister is pregnant .
we reckon she' s about three months along .
this is her first checkup .
yesterday and today i bled a little .
lie down on the couch , and strip from the waist down .
don' t worry .
put this on .
thankyou .
according to the ultrasound , the fetus seems to be fine .
doyou live together ?
no .
yes .
which is it ?
she lives with our mother , but she hasn' t told her anything yet .
is your blood pressure usually high ?
yes , i have hypertension .
there' s a risk ofmiscarriage .
you must move as little as possible .
but i' ve got to do myjob .
your onlyjob now is to rest and not do anything stupid .
tell your mother to watch her blood pressure .
she has to follow a salt free diet and rest .
i' il tell her .
listen , doctor , i work with people who are high risk ... so i' d like to have an ai ds test as well .
what' s yourjob ?
she' s a social worker .
when can we pick up the results ?
in two weeks ' time .
you have to tell your mother .
you need to be looked after .
i found ajobyesterday , and i' m going to be busy all day .
listen .
you' ve no right to ask me to beyour mother .
you' ve already got one , even ifyou don' t like her .
we can' t choose our parents .
they are who they are .
oh , god !
please , don' t blackmail me !
idon' tknowifi was right to call the clinic .
whatelse couldyoudo ?
ican' tbelieveher andgo onliving withstanley .
then don' t believe her .
what matters is you and your baby .
what ifshe told me the truth ?
blanche ?
blanche is in no shape to tell the truth ... even ifshe wanted to , poor thing .
where is my heart ?
she means herjewel box .
it' s heart shaped .
i think it' s here somewhere .
look , here it is .
i need a necklace .
we' il look for it .

i just left her at home , in bed .
in bed ?
what' s wrong ?
i think it' s food poisoning .
she was so ill this morning .
why didn' tyou tell me when i called ?
we didn' t want to upsetyou .

yes .
she' s got gastroenteritis , but she' il be fine tomorrow .

i was a brute when we met .
but i' d remind you that it was never a problem foryou .

you planned it all , you bitch !
nina , don' t be so rude .
just like eve harrington .
you learned the part on purpose .
it' s fucking impossible to learn it over the loudspeakers .
you think i' m stupid ?
the loudspeakers helped me remember it .
i' ve known the part ofstella foryears .
really ?
what a coincidence !
ifyou only knew .
what did i tell you ?
whywereyou here that first night ?
orwas that a coincidence too ?
no , it wasn' t a coincidence .
i won' t botheryou anymore .
i' il get my things and go .
manuela , i thinkyou owe us an explanation .
a streetcarnameddesire has marked my life .
twentyyears ago , i played stella with an amateur group .
that' s where i met my husband .
he was playing kowalski .
two months ago , i sawyourversion in madrid .
i went with my son .
it was the night ofhis birthday .
it was pouring rain , but we waited outside ... because he wanted your autograph , huma .
it was crazy to wait in the rain ... but it was his birthday , so i couldn' t say no .
you two got in a taxi , and he ran afteryou .
a car coming along the street ran him down .
he was killed .
that' s the explanation .
that' s the explanation , huma .
move , rosa .
i can' t get past .
what areyou doing here ?
hello .
i came to payyou .
you leftyesterday withoutyour money .
this is my sister rosa .
hello .
how areyou ?
let me helpyou .
let' s get the elevator .
where' s nina ?
i left herwith mario .
she says hi .
leave the bags here .
you go and rest for a while , rosa .
i' m not tired .
don' t argue .
sit down .
anything to drink ?
no , thankyou .
she' s like a little girl .
i couldn' t sleep all night thinking aboutyour son .
i can remember his face in the rain perfectly ... and the notebook in his hand .
i can see him now .
i don' t want to talk about my son .
i can' t .
apart from apologizing , nina and and i wantyou to come back .
rosa' s sick .
she needs someone to look after her all day .
i can' t leave her .
i' m sorry .
i don' t know what i should do .
why don' tyou check nina into a clinic ?
ifwe don' t fulfill the contract , the companywill sue me .
find a replacement ... and finish your run with the company .
i can' t do the play without nina .
she' s hooked onjunk , but i' m hooked on her .
who was it ?
agrado .
and you let her in ?
you should have said we were busy .
i' m thinking ofyou .
come on , lie down here and stop moving around .
what exactly is wrong with you ?
an accident .
what kind ?
why didn' t i think ofit before ?
agrado could take my place .
ofcourse !
the oneyou didn' t want to let in ?
that' s something between us , but she' s perfect foryou .
how old is agrado ?
pretty old .
between thirty and fifty .
is agrado her real name ?
no , it' s a stage name .
like huma .
you know why i took the name huma ?
yes .
manuela told me .
what else did she tell you ?
everything .
she told me everything .
aboutyou and nina ... thejunk ... and that it' il end badly .
really ?
and what else did she say ?
i' m very curious .
that as an actress , you' re wonderful ... but that as a person , you' re very mixed up .
and what else ?
that i shouldn' t say anything .
what haveyou got in the bag ?
cava and ice cream .
what for ?
to celebrateyour success last night , bitch .
thankyou .
come in .
oh , what a surprise !
three single girls in an empty house ... always reminds me of how to marrya millionaire .
how areyou , sister rosa ?
huma , this is agrado .
my pleasure .
i' m " fans .
how areyou ?
huma , you' re a goddess , a living legend .
like i said , i' m " fans , " in the plural ... but my manuela was too much the other night .
how i bawled at the evening show !
shouldn' tyou be in el salvador ?
yes , but i' m not going now .
i' m staying here .
agrado , i don' t work for huma anymore .
beforeyou came , we were saying thatyou could take my place .
me play stella ?
i see myselfmore as blanche .
replacing me , not nina , and much less huma .
thankyou , manuela , but i don' t
try her for a few days .
she isn' t as clueless as she seems .
i am , huma , and worse .
right now , i don' t get this at all .
so i' il giveyou the bottle to cheer us up a bit .
i brought ice cream .
come on , let' s have a drink and relax a bit .
i' il get the glasses .
i' il just have some ice cream .
i can' t drink alcohol .
well , i' il have a drink .
hey , what' s up with manuela ?
she seems very odd .
success hasn' t gone to her head already , has it ?
she wants to dumpyou on huma .
i think prada is ideal for a nun .
my problem is everything suits me , so i' m very eclectic .
i' ve had chilblains since i came to barcelona .
oh , really ?
it' s finished .
should i get more ?
i' d love some , but no .
where' s the bathroom ?
straight ahead .
excuse me .
fill me in on what' s happening here .
i' m no stranger .
i' il tell you tomorrow .
no , don' t !
she can' t keep her mouth shut .
i know verywell how to keep it shut .
i played along like an english lady so she wouldn' t catch on .
i' m a model ofdiscretion , even when i' m sucking someone' s cock .
i' ve sucked a lot ofcocks in public places ... and no one' s noticed , except the person involved .
it' s been ages since i sucked a cock !
i love the word " cock .
and " prick " !
i have to go .
areyou all right ?
what ?
areyou all right ?
better than ever .
can you help her find a taxi ?
i nearly forgot .
this is foryou .
thankyou .
well , good bye , girls .
so long .
you have to teach me how to bark .
i think i was a bit rude to huma .
i said all sorts ofthings .
really ?
it doesn' t matter .
they' re very different for sisters , aren' t they ?
are they sisters ?
that' s what manuela said .
well , ifshe says so .
i thinkyou' re all bullshitters .
you have to get to know us .
can you drive ?
i used to be a truck driver .
really ?
in paris , before i got my tits .
then i gave up the truck and became a whore .
how interesting .
very .
a check .
1 50, 000 .
how generous !
what is it ?
huma' s autograph , for esteban .
this is theautograph inevergaveyou ... andnotbecause youdidn' t try .
ihavebeen foolish , casting mypearlsbeforeswine .
youmeanme ?
youandyour friend , mr. mitchell .
he came toseeme andrepeatedtheslanderyou' dtoldhim .
so i threwhim out .
you threwmitch out ?
he returned with a box ofroses to beg my forgiveness . " forgive me , " he said , but some things are not forgivable .
cruelty is not forgivable .
it is the one unforgivable thing .
well ?
areyou learning the part too ?
ofcourse not .
you should, just in case .
you think so ?
may i have some privacy ?
soyou can getyour fix ?
can' t wait till the end ?
ifyou know , why ask ?
ifyou don' t want me to tell huma , do it in the bathroom .
i don' t need to see these things .
all right .
keep an eye on the door .
i know that when you' reyoung well , you' re no child you don' t value these things .
butyou' re cute , nicely proportioned kind ofsmall , but cute .
you' ve lost weight well , it' s all the drugs but the important thing is you' ve lost weight .
you' ve got talent
limited talent , butyou' ve got it .
and , above all , a woman who loves you .
and you trade it all forjunk .
you think it' s worth it ?
well , it isn' t .
it isn' t worth it .
i trade it for a bit ofpeace .
come on , help me .
you' re getting flat as a board .
compared toyou .
what a dirty habit !
haven' tyou ever thought ofcutting it off ?
i' d get no work .
the clients like us pneumatic and well hung .
rheumatic ?
guys are so odd .
not rheumatic .
pneumatic .
a pair oftits as hard as newly inflated tires ... and a big dick as well .
show meyour cock .
that fix didn' t agree with you .
maybe i' il like it too .
you' ve got enough problems as it is .
go , you' re on now .
and don' t throw up on anybody .
the audience loves it .
they think it' s because i' m pregnant .
you' re not pregnant in this scene .
you' ve had a doll .
that' s right .
will you show me your cock later ?
i' il show it toyou and you can lick it .
young people will try anything !
months later
i' m going to call him esteban .
your son ?
why ?
afteryours .
this babywill belong to both ofus .
ifonly he did .
ifonlywe were alone in the world ... without any commitments .
you and your son , just for me .
butyou have a family .
i' m going to fixyour hair and makeyou up a bit .
why ?
i like to seeyou look nice .
and i called your mother .
she' s coming to seeyou today .
my mother ?
you have a mother .
don' tyou remember ?
what will i tell her ?
thatyou love her i don' t know .
come in , huma .
no , it isn' t huma .
may i come in ?
ofcourse , mario .
come in .
you' re very early today .
yes .
what areyou doing ?
just a bit ofironing .
is anything wrong ?
i didn' t sleep verywell last night .
i' ve been on edge all day .
would you give me a blowjob ?
can' tyou all get it intoyour heads that i' m retired ?
i don' t wantyou to think that ... but since i' ve been on edge all day ...
i think a blowjob would relax me .
you give me one .
i' m on edge too .
well , it would be the first time i' ve sucked a woman' s cock ... but ifthat' s what it takes
the whole company is obsessed with my cock !
it isn' t the only one around .
don' tyou have a cock ?
yes .
do people askyou to suck their cocks becauseyou' ve got one ?
do they ?
no .
well , then ?
look , i' il suckyou off to showyou how open minded ... and how sensitive i am about these things .
where' s the fucking phone ?
hello ?
all right , don' t worry .
i' il see to everything .
shall we go to my room ?
in case huma comes
huma can' t come .
she' s in the hospital , along with nina .
what' s happened ?
they nearly killed each other .
fuck !
here .
we' il have to cancel the performance .
don' t say anything .
we have to say something .
yes , but it doesn' t have to be the truth .
i' il make something up .
right .
and
hello , how areyou ?
hello .
come in .
where is she ?
there , in the bedroom .
and here i was so worried , thinking you were in el salvador .
i seeyou' ve learned to lie .
i didn' t know how to tell you .
what areyou going to do now ?
leave the order ?
get married ?
mom , the things you ask !
one never knows with you .
at least , i don' t .
even this i had to learn about through your friend .
what would i have done without her ?
how' s dad ?
same as ever .
i don' t know .
worse .
ifyou don' t mind , i' d rather not tell him anything .
he wouldn' t get it anyway .
and sapic ?
fine .
rosa , i don' t know what to do .
what doyou expect me to do ?
nothing , mom .
you don' t expect anything from me ?
it isn' t that .
what i mean is don' t make it harder for me .
would you like anything ?
i' m making tea .
no , thankyou .
what exactly is wrong ?
i didn' t understand over the phone .
according to the ultrasound , she' s got placenta previa .
when the time comes , she' il need a caesarian .
in the meantime , she must have complete rest .
doyou think i should take her home ?
i have to look after her father as ifhe were a child .
you' re her mother ... but i think rosa' s better offhere .
that' s the impression she gave me .
ifyou need money , just ask me .
and , please , keep me informed .
yes .
don' t worry .
thankyou very much .
i' il seeyou out .
no , really .
i don' t know what i did wrong with rosa .
ever since she was born , she' s been like an alien .
doyou have children ?
yes , one .
doyou get along well with him ?
he died .
i' m sorry .
due to reasons beyond their control ... two ofthe actresses who triumph daily on this stage ... cannot be here tonight the poor things .
so the show has been cancelled .
those who wish can get their money back ... but for those who have nothing better to do ... it' s a shame to waste the rare occasion thatyou make it to the theater .
ifyou stay ...
i promise to entertain you with my life story .
good bye .
i' m very sorry .
ifi boreyou , you can pretend to snore like this .
i' il get the idea , and you certainly won' t hurt my feelings .
honestly .
they call me " la agrado " ... because i' ve always tried to make people' s lives agreeable .
as well as being agreeable , i' m very authentic !
look at this body !
all made to measure .
almond shaped eyes 80, 000 .
nose 200, 000 .
a waste ofmoney .
another beating the following year left it like this .
it gives me character , but ifl' d known ...
i wouldn' t have touched it .
i' il continue .
tits two , because i' m no monster .
70, 000 each , but i' ve more than earned that back .
silicone in
where ?
lips , forehead , cheeks ... hips and ass .
a pint costs about 1 00, 000 ... soyou work it out , because i' ve lost count .
jaw reduction 75, 000 .
complete laser depilation ... because women , like men , also come from apes .
60, 000 a session .
it depends how hairyyou are .
usually , two to four sessions .
but ifyou' re a flamenco diva , you' il need more .
well , as i was saying ... it costs a lot to be authentic , ma' am .
and one can' t be stingy with these things ... becauseyou are more authentic ... the moreyou resemble whatyou' ve dreamed ofbeing .
i' il turn you around .
please , be careful .
don' t worry .
we' il lift up a bit .
that' s it .
areyou all right ?
yes .
ifyou can push it over here
i' il put this away .
thankyou .
can you manage ?
yes .
to the hospital del mar , please .
can we go through medinaceli square ?
aren' t we meeting your mother at the hospital ?
i just want to see the square .
all right .
stop here !
i played here as a child .
sapic !
come here , boy !
hello , sapic .
that dog would go with anybody .
doyou have a dog ?
no , but i really like them .
how old areyou ?
twenty six .
and how tall areyou ?
not very .
five six .
come on .
go on .
go back to dad .
come on .
good bye , dad .
you aren' t in any pain ?
no .
that' s great .
painless childbirth .
when is she going into surgery ?
in an hour and a half .
i' ve got time to go check on your father and come back .
you don' t have to come back , mom .
i want to be here with you .
give dad a kiss for me .
i' m keeping this one .
so long .
good bye .
i hope the third esteban is the definitive one foryou .
the third esteban ?
lola was the first ... and your son , the second .
soyou knew lola was the father ofmy son too .
ofcourse .
it didn' t take a genius .
lola doesn' t know we had a son .
i never told him .
did your son know ?
no , he didn' t .
let' s not talk about sad things .
this is a great day .
they' ve put videla injail , and your son' s going to be born .
promise me one thing .
what ?
ifanything happens  what could happen ?
promiseyou won' t hide anything from the child .
i don' t have to .
you can tell him whateveryou wantyourself .
promise me .
ifit makes you happier .
all right .
i promise .
we are here today to say good bye to our sister rosa .
manuela , i' m so happy to seeyou .
what a pity it has to be here .
it couldn' t be anywhere else .
you aren' t a human being , lola .
you' re an epidemic !
i was always excessive .
and i' m very tired .
manuela , i' m dying .
come .
i' m saying good bye to everything .
i robbed agrado to pay my ticket to argentina .
i wanted to take a last look at the town ... the river ... our street .
and i' m happy i can say good bye toyou too .
now i just have to see sister rosa' s child .
my son .
i always dreamed ofhaving a son .
you know that .
when i left barcelona , i was carrying your child .
what ?
you mean you too
did you have it ?
a beautiful boy .
i want to see him .
did you bring him with you ?
he' s in madrid , butyou can' t see him .
even from a distance .
i promise he won' t see me .
it' s the last thing i ask ofyou .
you can' t see him .
please !
six months ago , he was run over by a car .
he' s dead .
i only came to barcelona to tell you .
i' m sorry .
the baby !
where haveyou been ?
haven' tyou taken sapic outyet ?
you weren' t here .
i' m here now .
he' s hungry .
the bottle' s heating .
will you get it , please ?
come here .
vicenta , don' t let my husband come in here , please .
he' s convinced the baby' s yours .
yes , i know .
he' s veryjealous .
i told him the babywas yours .
i don' t dare tell him the truth .
he wouldn' t understand anyway .
ifonly he were mine .
what is it ?
who' s that woman ?
it' s manuela , the new cook .
she' s been with us four days .
we' ve fixed up this room so she can be here with her child .
remember ?
i told you .
how old areyou ?
thirty eight .
how tall areyou ?
five seven .
all right .
nowyou can go for a walk .
go on .
thereyou are .
the bottle , ma' am .
thankyou .
thankyou .
no , no .
we' re going to eat now .
yes ?
don' t tell anyone about the antibodies .
do the nuns know ?
all right .
one month later
hello , lola .
take him .
what did the doctor say ?
he' s fine .
you can see he' s normal .
you' re with dad .
can i give him a kiss ?
ofcourse .
my son , i' m sorry to leaveyou such an awful inheritance .
don' t say that .
there' s no reason why he should develop the disease .
this is our esteban .
you called him esteban too ?
thankyou .
he wanted to be a writer .
this is his notebook .
he took it with him everywhere .
he wrote this the morning ofthe day he died .
read it .
last night mom showed me a picture .
halfofit was missing .
i didn' t want to tell her , but my life is missing that same half .
keep reading .
this morning i looked through her drawers ... and found a bundle ofpictures .
theywere all missing a half .
my father , i suppose .
i want to meet him .
i have to make mom understand that i don' t care who he is ... orwhat he' s like ... or how he behaved towards her .
she can' t deny me that right .
keep the picture .
thankyou .
i don' t likejust anyone kissing the baby .
who was that woman in the barwith you ?
that woman is his father .
what did you say ?
that was his father , and he' s very ill .
that monster is the one who killed my daughter ?
don' t think about that , rosa .
there are people who think children are made in a day .
but it takes a long time a very long time .
that' s why it' s so awful to see your child' s blood on the ground .
a stream that flows for a minute and yet costs us years .
when i found my son ... he was lying in the middle ofthe street .
i soaked my hands in his blood and licked them .
because it was mine .
animals lick theiryoung , don' t they ?
i' m not disgusted by my son .
you don' t know what it' s like .
in a monstrance ofglass and topaz ...
i would put the earth soaked by his blood .
keep kneading .
the sadness should go intoyour hands .
work .
you have to work .
you don' t notice my cold ?
no , it' s fine .
come on .
you shouldn' t be in here .
hello .
i' ve got a bouquet foragrado and huma rojo .
really ?
yes .
sign here , please .
you sure it' s foragrado ?
yes , it says so .
here .
know why they call me agrado ?
i' ve always tried to make life agreeable for others .
right .
running away once again with no good byes ... though i know how much you like them , agrado .
thesituation with rosa' sparents is unbearable .
thegrandmotherisafraid ascratch willinfecther .
i' m taking esteban wherehe won' tbe surroundedbyhostility .

i knew it .
how i prayed for that child .
