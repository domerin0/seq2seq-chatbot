# looking out a dirty , old window ? ?
outside the cars in the city go rushing by ? ?
i sit here alone , and i wonder why ? ?
friday night and everyone' s moving ? ?
i can feel the heat ? ?
but it' s soothing ? ?
heading down ? ?
i search for the beat in this dirty town ? ?
downtown , the young ones are going ? ?
downtown , the young ones are growing ? ?
we' re the kids in america ? ?
we' re the kids in america ??
so , o. k. , you' re probably going ,
is this , like , a noxema commercial or what ?
but seriously ,
i actually have a way normal life for a teenage girl .
i mean , i get up , i brush my teeth .
and i pick out my school clothes .
?
they do it over there ? ?
but we don' t do it here ? ?
ooh , bop ? ?
fashion ? ?
fashion ? ?
turn to the left ? ?
fashion ? ?
turn to the right ? ?
ooh , fashion ??
daddy' s a litigator .
those are the scariest kinds of lawyers .
even lucy , our maid , is terrified of him .
and daddy is so good , he gets $500 an hour to fight with people .
he fights with me for free .
daddy !
cher , please don' t start with the juice again .
daddy , you need your vitamin c.
where' s my briefcase ?
it' s been a couple months now .
let' s go to malibu .
don' t tell me those lowlifes have been calling again .
they are your parents .
don' t sneak out of the office .
dr. lovett' s giving you a flu shot .
josh is coming for dinner .
why ?
he' s your stepbrother !
you were hardly married to his mother .
why do i have to see josh ?
you divorce wives , not children .
here .
forget it !
did i show you the loqued out jeep daddy got me ?
it' s got four wheel drive , dual side airbags , and a monster sound system .
i don' t have a license yet , but i need something to learn on .
boy !
that came out of nowhere !
here' s where dionne lives .
she' s my friend because we both know what it' s like to have people jealous of us .
girlfriend !
i must give her snaps for her courageous fashion efforts .
hey , cher .
dionne and i were both named after great singers of the past who now do infomercials .
so ?
been shopping with dr. seuss ?
i wouldn' t skin a collie for a backpack .
it' s faux .
hello !
that was a stop sign .
i totally paused .
yeah .
o. k.
it' s not even 8 : 30 , and murray is paging me .
he is so possessive .
this weekend he called me , and he' s all , where were you today ?
dionne and her boyfriend murray are in this dramatic relationship .
i think they' ve seen that lke and tina turner movie just too many times .
now , i have to say to her ...
why do you put up with it ?
you could do better .
i know .
shh .
here he comes .
woman , why don' t you be answering any of my pages ?
i hate when you call me woman .
where you been all weekend ?
you jeepin ' behind my back ?
jeepin ' .
no !
but speaking of vehicular sex , perhaps you can explain how this kmart hair extension got into the backseat of your car .
i don' t know where that came from .
that looks like one of your stringy something or anothers .
i do not wear polyester hair , o. k. ?
unlike shawanna .
dee , i' m audi .
bye .
that' s it .
i' ve had it with you .
is it that time of the month again ?
i don' t know why
dionne' s going out with a high school boy .
they' re like dogs .
you have to clean them and feed them .
they' re just like these nervous creatures that jump and slobber all over you .
ew !
get off of me !
oh , as if !
should all oppressed people be allowed refuge in america ?
amber will take the con position .
cher will be pro .
cher , two minutes .
so .
o. k.
like , right now , for example , the haiti ans need to come to america .
some people are all ,
what about the strain on our resources ?
like , when i had this garden party for my father' s birthday , right ?
i said rsvp because it was a sit down dinner .
but people came that , like , did not rsvp , so i was , like , totally buggin ' .
i had to haul ass to the kitchen , redistribute the food , squish in extra place settings .
by the end of the day , it was , like , the more the merrier .
so if the government could just get to the kitchen , rearrange some things , we could certainly party with the haiti ans .
may i remind you that it does not say rsvp on the statue of liberty ?
whoo !
yeah !
thank you very much .
amber , reply ?
mr. hall , how can i answer that ?
the topic is haiti , and she' s talking about some little party .
hello !
it was his 50th birthday .
whatever .
if she doesn' t do the assignment , i can' t do mine .
ladies .
so , does anyone have any further thoughts on cher' s oration ?
elton , comments ?
yeah , i can' t find my cranberries cd .
i got to go to the quad before somebody snags it .
i' m afraid i can' t permit that .
any further insights ?
i have an insight , mr. hall .
i' m all ears .
o. k. , like , the way i feel about the rolling stones is the way my kids are going to feel about nine inch nails , so i really shouldn' t torment my mom anymore , huh ?
yes , well , it' s a little off the subject of haiti , but tolerance is always a good lesson .
even when it comes out of nowhere .
and with that in mind ,
i' m going to distribute your report cards .
now , is there a christian stovitz in this class ?
mr. hall , the buzz on christian is that his parents have joint custody .
he' il be spending one semester in chicago and one semester here .
i think it is a travesty of the legal profession .
thank you for that perspective , cher .
could all conversations please come to a halt ?
and could the suicide attempts please be postponed till the next period ?
suddenly , a dark cloud settled over first period .
i got a c in debate ?
dee ?
did you get your report card ?
yeah .
i' m toast .
how did you do ?
i totally choked .
my father' s going to go ballistic on me .
mr. hall was way harsh .
he gave me a c minus .
he gave me a c , which drags down my entire average .
bye .
i' il call you .
isn' t my house classic ?
the columns date all the way back to 1972 .
wasn' t my mom a betty ?
she died when i was just a baby .
a fluke accident during a routine liposuction .
i don' t remember her , but i like to pretend she still watches over me .
hey , mom .
98 in geometry .
pretty groovy , huh ?
yuck !
the maudlin music of the university station ?
wah wah wah !
yuck !
what is it about college and crybaby music ?
hey .
who' s watching the galleria ?
the flannel shirt ...
is that a nod to the crispy seattle weather ?
or are you trying to stay warm in front of the refrigerator ?
oh , wow , you' re filling out there .
oh , wow , your face is catching up with your mouth .
i went by dad' s office .
he is not your dad .
go torture a new family .
just because my mother marries someone else doesn' t mean he' s my father .
that' s exactly what it means .
i hope you' re not thinking of staying here .
i sure want to .
i got a place near school .
shouldn' t you go to school on the east coast ?
i hear girls at nyu aren' t at all particular .
you' re funny .
hey !
you just got here , and already you' re playing couch commando .
in some parts of the universe , it' s considered cool to know what' s going on in the world .
i so need lessons from you on how to be cool .
tell me that part about kenny g. again .
come on , you chuckleheads !
get in here !
josh , are you still growing ?
you look taller than you did at easter .
i don' t think so .
his head looks bigger .
so , josh , have you given any thought to our discussion about corporate law ?
i think i' d like to check out environmental law .
what for ?
you want to have a miserable , frustrating life ?
josh will have that no matter what he does .
he knows what he wants to do .
he' s in a good college .
i' d like to see you have some direction .
i have direction .
yeah .
towards the mall .
where' s your report card ?
it' s not ready yet .
what do you mean it' s not ready yet ?
some teachers were trying to lowball me , daddy .
you say never accept a first offer .
these grades are a jumping off point to start negotiations .
very good .
dee ?
hello ?
yeah ?
yeah , jake .
what ?
no !
not the afternoon !
you are such a brownnoser .
you are such a superficial space cadet .
what makes you think your teachers will change your grades ?
only the fact that i' ve done it every other semester .
i told my p. e. teacher an evil male had broken my heart .
so she raised my c to a b.
they' re horrible !
don' t feel bad !
and they' re all like this .
then i promised miss geist
i' d start a letter writing campaign to my congressman about violations of the clean air act .
but mr. hall was totally rigid .
he said my debates were unresearched , unstructured , and unconvincing .
as if !
i felt impotent and out of control , which i really hate .
i needed to find sanctuary in a place where i could gather my thoughts and regain my strength .
what' s wrong ?
are you suffering from buyer' s remorse or something ?
no .
nothing like that .
we' ve been shopping all day , and i still don' t know what to do about mr. hall .
i' ve tried everything to convince him of my scholastic aptitude , but i was brutally rebuffed .
he' s a miserable little man who wants to make everyone else miserable , too .
dee , that' s it !
we' ve got to figure out a way to make mr. hall sublimely happy .
here' s the 411 on mr. hall ...
he' s single , he' s 47 , and he earns minor ducats at a thankless job .
what that man needs is a good , healthy boink fest .
unfortunately , there was a major babe drought in my school .
the evil trolls from the math department were actually married .
ooh , snickers .
and in the grand tradition of p. e. teachers ,
ms. stoeger seemed to be same sex oriented .
of course , there was always miss geist .
something told me not to discount miss geist .
well , sure , she has runs in her stockings , and her slip is always showing , and she has more lipstick on her teeth than on her mouth .
popular uprisings from estates to the general assembly !
god , this woman is screaming for a makeover .
i' m her only hope .
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may , but thy eternal summer shall not fade .
did you write that ?
tscha !
it' s a famous quote .
from where ?
cliffs notes .
run along .
see you third period .
try to remember to bring our textbooks .
oh , my god !
she actually looked happy .
classic !
paradoasm banofshon ... 16 tardies to work off .
janet hong ... no tardies .
travis birkenstock ... 38 tardies .
by far the most tardies in the class .
congratulations .
this is so unexpected .
i didn' t even have a speech prepared .
uh , but i would like to say this .
tardiness is not something you can do all on your own .
many , many people contributed to my tardiness .
thanks to my parents for never giving me a ride to school , the l. a. city bus driver for taking a chance on an unknown kid , the wonderful crew at mcdonald' s for spending hours making those egg mcmuffins , without which i might never be tardy .
if mr. birkenstock has no political messages to include in his speech ,
i' il go on .
cher horowitz ... two tardies .
i object !
do you recall the dates of these alleged tardies ?
one was last monday .
mr. hall , i was surfing the crimson wave .
i had to haul ass to the ladies .
i assume you are referring to women' s troubles , so i' il let that one slide .
thank you , mr. hall .
miss geist was right about you .
what do you mean ?
well , she said that you were the only one in this school with any intelligence .
cher , get in here .
yes , daddy ?
will you tell me what the hell this is ?
a second notice for three outstanding tickets .
i don' t remember getting a first notice .
the ticket is the first notice .
i didn' t know you could get tickets without a license !
sure you can .
you can get tickets anytime .
well , not around here you can' t .
from this moment on , you will not drive , sit , do anything in that jeep without a supervised driver .
no cruising around with dionne .
two permits do not equal a license .
do i make myself clear ?
yes , daddy .
cher , i expect you to become a good driver .
i will .
i' m going to practice real hard .
o. k.
a licensed driver with nothing to do ?
where would i find such a loser ?
granola breath , you got something on your chin .
i' m growing a goatee .
you don' t want to be the last one at the coffeehouse without chin pubes .
i enjoy these little chats of ours , but in the interest of saving time , just tell me what you want .
o. k.
so , actually , i have a permit , but daddy says i can' t take the jeep out without a licensed driver .
since you' re not doing anything ...
what are the chances of you shutting up till you get your way ?
slim to none .
come on .
hey , james bond .
in america , we drive on the right side of the road .
i am .
you try driving in platforms .
i got to get back to school .
want to practice parking ?
what' s the point ?
everywhere you go has valet .
what class you going to ?
actually , i' m going to a tree people meeting .
we might get marky mark to plant a celebrity tree .
how fabulous .
getting marky mark to take time from his busy pants dropping schedule to plant trees .
why don' t you hire a gardener ?
maybe marky mark wants to use his popularity for a good cause , make a contribution .
in case you' ve never heard of that , a contribution is ...
i have donated many italian outfits to lucy .
as soon as i get my license ,
i fully intend to brake for animals , and i have contributed many hours to helping two lonely teachers find romance .
which i' il bet serves your interests more than theirs .
if i ever saw you do anything that wasn' t 90 % selfish ,
i' d die of shock .
oh , that would be reason enough for me .
would you call me selfish ?
no .
not to your face .
really ?
is josh giving you shit because he' s in his postadolescent idealistic phase ?
look , there' s mr. hall .
mr. hall !
mr. hall !
um , do you drink coffee ?
not from this cafeteria .
yes , under normal circumstances .
i am such a retard .
when i was packing daddy' s lunch ,
i gave him my lemon snapple and took his sucky italian roast .
do you want it ?
you sure you don' t want it ?
tscha !
it might stunt my growth .
i want to be 5' 10 like cindy crawford .
but i thought you or miss geist might like it .
maybe you could share it .
well ... thanks .
sure .
miss geist !
miss geist !
did you sign up for the environmental fair ?
we will .
you have pretty eyes .
don' t hide them .
these clips are so cute .
and this tiny little waist .
look .
wow .
girls .
oh , don' t forget to sign up for the environmental fair .
not a total betty , but a vast improvement .
we did our best .
we got to book to p. e.
come on , dee .
i feel like bailing , dude .
i know what you mean , but at least it' s exercise .
i feel like such a heifer .
i had two bowls of special k , three pieces of turkey bacon , five peanut butter m& m' s , and , like , three pieces of licorice .
oh , my god .
look .
is that a photo op or what ?
look at that body language ...
legs crossed towards each other .
that' s an unequivocal sex invite .
oh , cher , he' s getting her digits .
look at geist .
she is so cute .
ohh .
old people can be so sweet .
?
the world is full of fools ? ?
who never get it right ? ?
you don' t know what to do ? ?
so you do anything you like ? ?
put your feet in drive ? ?
oh , you' re a silly thing ? ?
put your feet in drive ? ?
you' re such a pretty thing ?
?
you' re going out tonight ?
?
there' s nothing to lose ... ??
the entire student body was utterly grateful for the improvement in their grades . ?
don' t ever change ? ?
don' t ever change ? ?
no , never change ??
cher , what' s this all about ?
my report card ?
the same semester ?
uh huh .
what did you do ?
turn in extra credit ?
no .
take the midterms over ?
uh uh .
you mean to tell me that you argued your way from a c plus to an a minus ?
totally based on my powers of persuasion .
you proud ?
i couldn' t be happier if they were based on real grades .
fabulous .
i felt so satisfied , i wanted to do more good deeds .
ah choo !
dee , when your allergies act up , take out your nose ring .
follow through !
there you go .
there you go .
all right , cher !
earth to cher .
come in , cher .
ms. stoeger ...
i would just like to say that physical education in this school is a disgrace .
i mean , standing in line for 40 minutes is hardly aerobically effective .
i doubt i worked off the calories in a stick of carefree gum .
whoo !
whoo !
you exercised your mouth , cher .
hit the ball .
ms. stoeger , that machine is just a lawsuit waiting to happen .
thanks for the legal advice .
dionne , you' re up .
i have a note from my tennis instructor saying i shouldn' t expose myself to any training that might derail his teachings .
fine .
amber !
my plastic surgeon doesn' t want me doing any activity where balls fly at my nose .
well , there goes your social life .
ms. stoeger ... got another one .
ladies , we have a new student with us .
this is tai frasier .
you could hit a few balls in those clothes .
she could be a farmer in those clothes .
dee , my mission is clear .
would you look at that girl ?
she is so adorably clueless .
we' ve got to adopt her .
she is toe up .
our stock would plummet .
don' t you want to use your popularity for a good cause ?
no .
come here !
yeah , come here .
hang with us .
oh , thank you .
how do you like california ?
man , i' m freakin ' .
i could really use some sort of herbal refreshment .
we do lunch in 10 minutes .
we don' t have any tea , but we have coke .
you guys got coke here ?
yeah .
this is america .
so we decided to show tai the ropes at bronson alcott high school .
that is alana' s group over there .
they do the tv station .
they think that' s the most important thing on earth .
and that' s the persian mafia .
you can' t hang with them unless you own a bmw .
there' s elton in the white vest , with all the most popular boys .
including my boyfriend .
ain' t he cute ?
if you decide to date a high school boy , they' re the only acceptable ones .
which one of them' s your boyfriend ?
as if !
cher' s got attitude about high school boys .
it' s a personal choice every woman has got to make for herself .
woman , lend me $5 . 00 .
murray , i have asked you repeatedly not to call me woman .
excuse me , miss dionne , street slang is an increasingly valid form of expression .
most feminine pronouns do have mocking but not necessarily misogynistic undertone .
wow .
you guys talk like grownups .
well , this is a really good school .
i' m going to go get a soda .
do you guys want ?
sure .
she' s nice .
ooh !
project !
oh , wow .
that' s disgusting .
that' s a nice representation .
thanks .
those are really nice stickers .
i was thinking it was too cluttered .
i want to concentrate on one main decorative statement ,
like marvin the martian right there .
i can do marvin the martian .
really ?
i mean there' s not really a lot to him , but you want to see ?
yeah .
that' s really cool .
thanks .
wait .
i got one here .
you didn' t trace these ?
uh uh .
no .
here' s another one over here ... and lots of little guys .
that is so cute .
you' re really good at it .
no .
no , really .
you are .
yeah .
are you sure that' s fat free ?
oh , yes .
and you lose weight by cutting it small .
i met a really cool guy .
describe .
he' s got long hair .
straight off he offers me some smoke .
there he is !
are you talking about drugs ?
yeah .
tai , how old are you ?
i' il be 16 in may .
my birthday' s in april , and as someone older , can i please give you some advice ?
it is one thing to spark up a doobie at parties , but it is another to be fried all day .
do you see the distinction ?
yeah .
loadies generally hang on the grassy knoll .
sometimes they come to class and say bonehead things , and we all laugh , of course , but no respectable girl actually dates them .
you don' t want to start off on the wrong foot , do you ?
i' ve got an idea .
let' s do a makeover .
no .
no .
cher' s main thrill in life is a makeover .
it gives her a sense of control in a chaotic world .
please ?
sure .
why not ?
you guys , i' ve never had straight friends before .
?
i don' t care ? ?
what my teachers say ? ?
i' m gonna be a supermodel ? ?
and everyone ? ?
is gonna dress like me ? ?
wait and see ? ?
when i' m a supermodel ? ?
and my hair will shine like the sea ?
?
and everyone ? ?
will want to look ? ?
just like me ? ?
eeee ? ?
' cause i' m young ? ?
i' m hip ? ?
and so beautiful ? ?
i' m going to be a supermodel ??
squeeze your buttocks when you come up .
squeeze in .
i don' t want to do this anymore .
my buns don' t feel nothing like steel .
o. k. it will get easier .
i promise .
just as long as we do it every day , not sporadically .
how do you know if we' re doing it sporadically ?
we' ve got to work on your accent and vocabulary .
sporadic means once in a while .
use it in a sentence today .
from now on , we' re alternating cindy crawford' s aerobicize and buns of steel and reading one nonschool book a week .
my first book is fit or fat .
mine is men are from mars , women are from venus .
good .
that takes care of our minds and bodies , but we should do something good for mankind for a couple of hours .
hey , brainiac .
ugh .
the dreaded ex .
tai , this is josh .
nice to meet you .
hey !
you know about this stuff .
i want to do something good for humanity .
how about sterilization ?
ha ha ha !
so what do you think ?
i' m amazed .
that i am devoting myself so generously to someone else ?
that you found someone more clueless than you are to worship you .
i am rescuing her from teenage hell .
the wounds of adolescence can take years to heal .
you' ve never had a mother .
you' re acting out on that poor girl
like your barbie doll .
freshman psych .
i am not taking psych .
i am going to take that lost soul and make her well dressed and popular .
her life will be better because of me .
how many girls can say that about you ? ?
mentos better ? ?
mentos fresher ? ?
fresh goes better ? ?
with mentos , fresh and full of life ! ??
mentos .
the freshmaker .
be seeing ya .
yeah , i hope not sporadically .
do you see how boys are responding ?
my heart is totally bursting .
i know !
cher , you have deamer ?
geist .
hey , tai , did you get a flyer ?
uh uh .
wow !
a party !
it' s in the valley .
the cops usually break them up in less than an hour , and it takes that long to get there .
it' s just local loadies .
do you guys think travis will be there ?
i thought we moved on from there .
don' t sell yourself short .
you' ve got something no one here has .
i' m not a virgin .
as far as everyone' s concerned , you' re the most popular girl in your school .
the fact that you hang with dee and i , well ...
speaks very highly of you .
if you strike while the iron is hot , you can have any guy that you want .
like who ?
who' s available ?
there' s bronson ...
i got it !
elton !
he just broke up with folette !
who' s elton ?
he' s way popular ,
like the social director of the crew .
his dad can get you into any concert .
i noticed him scoping you out .
he was looking at me ?
says you gave him a toothache .
how' d i do that ?
he thought you were sweet .
yeah ?
yeah ?
wow !
is that true ?
no .
you are so bad !
o. k. , you guys , all get together .
that is great .
smile !
tai , get a little closer .
closer , tai .
oh , great .
hey , elton , um ... why don' t you put your arm around tai ?
all right .
yeah , that' s good .
o. k.
o. k. tai .
come here , tai .
hold that .
o. k.
o. k.
cool picture .
doesn' t she look classic ?
yeah , she' s beautiful .
she' s like one of those botticelli chicks .
why don' t you make me a copy of this , o. k. ?
sure .
hi , daddy .
this is my friend tai .
get out of my chair !
thank you , lucy .
it looks great .
what is this crap ?
it' s from the cut your cholesterol cookbook .
dr. lovett says that you' ve got to get down to 200 .
no calls tonight .
but it' s dionne .
it might be important .
we' re having a nice family dinner .
so , uh , what did you do in school today ?
well ...
i broke in my purple clogs .
yeah , hello ?
dee ?
what up ?
so check it .
murray' s geometry class is right by elton' s locker .
taped up inside was the picture of tai .
oh , my god .
elton' s got a picture of you in his locker .
oh , no shit !
hello ?
the whole crew is going to this party in the valley .
bye .
we' re going to have to make a cameo at the val party .
i said i wanted it in the morning !
no !
just look at the top of the map .
sun valley is north .
no .
all i see is bel air .
you' re on the wrong map .
look at the number on the top .
there are no numbers .
there' s letters .
uh !
murray , shut up .
listen , tai , when we get there , make sure elton sees you , but don' t say hi first .
look like you' re having fun and you' re popular .
talk to a guy in his eyeline .
make him come to you .
find an excuse to leave during the conversation .
always have him wanting more .
i got it .
heads up !
oh !
did you just see that ?
skateboards .
that is , like , so five years ago .
you guys came .
that' s great .
you want a beer ?
i' il get you a beer .
no .
yeah !
oh , yeah !
this shit is whack .
this is ragin ' .
let' s do a lap before we commit to a location .
aah !
hey !
who was that ?
cher , ain' t that the same dress that you was wearing yesterday ?
say , ambular .
hi !
was that you going through my laundry ?
as if !
like i would really wear something from judy' s .
do you prefer fashion victim or ensembly challenged ?
uh !
that clone .
you look much better in that dress .
hey !
ruin my satin shoes , why don' t you ?
i' m sorry .
excuse me .
my shoes .
uh !
this is so not fixable .
it' s a small price to pay to the party gods .
look , i' il make amends .
how about some chronic shit ?
it' s the least you can do .
let' s spark it .
hey , elton' s over there .
act like travis is saying something funny .
sorry .
ha ha ha !

o. k. that' s it .
i' m calling your mother .
hold up !
no , no , no !
wait !
don' t call my mom !
yo , man !
chill !
chill !
don' t call my mom !
the same thing happened at the spring dance .
she spent the entire afterparty in the bathroom .
that almost destroyed my buzz .
i' m still baked .
what do you say we go bump into people ?
yeah .
i' m cool with that .
hey , tai !
wait up !
are you o. k. ?
yeah .
where' s your sense of good hospitality ?
that was so cool the way you did that .
i wish i could do it .
oh , no .
don' t .
why not ?
if girls did it , how would guys impress them ?
i don' t know , like ... stuff .
what kind of stuff ?
tai , i need you .
elton' s over there .
?
rollin ' with my homies ?
?
rollin ' with my homies ??
tai !
tai !
elton , help me !
use this .
you guys should use ice .
travis , we' ve got it under control !
tai , are you o. k. ?
travis , tai would have wanted you to enjoy the party .
if it' s a concussion , keep her conscious .
ask her questions .
what' s 7 times 7 ?
stuff she knows .
that' s some bump you got there .
yeah .
you ready to go back out there ?
yeah , i am .
you sure ?
can you do this ? ?
rollin ' with the homies ? ?
rollin ' with the homies ??
good !
let' s do it .
you' re ready .
i had to give myself snaps for all the good deeds i was doing .
it was great .
love was everywhere , and even though i was alone ,
i was really happy for tai .
it' s like that book i read in ninth grade that said , ' tis a far , far better thing doing stuff for other people .
hello ?
do you know what time it is ?
a watch doesn' t really go with this outfit , daddy .
where are you ?
having a snack with my girlfriends .
where , in kuwait ?
is that in the valley ?
i expect you to walk in this door in 20 minutes .
well , um , it might take longer than that , dad .
everywhere in l. a. takes 20 minutes .
sorry to make you leave .
dionne' s bucking for best dramatic actress at a val party .
ha ha ha !
hey , summer .
hi .
pretty random fiesta .
want a ride home ?
that would be great .
thanks .
no , i got her .
i' m right below wilshire and linden .
that' s right near me .
i' m above olympic .
great .
tai will go with summer .
cher , you' il come with me .
actually , if you take wilshire to canon , that turns into benedict .
then she' d have to go back south , and i' m already going north .
but you could take tai on your way up to sunset .
that doesn' t make any sense .
i' d have to get off the freeway .
i hate that .
tai , go with summer .
cher , you' il come with me .
watch your feet .
didn' t tai look cute tonight ? ?
away ? ?
turn away ? ?
turn away ? ?
turn away ??
i really love her hair when it' s all wild , you know ?
it' s also very pretty when it' s all up with that curly tendrils ,
like in that picture i took .
you know , you' re one of my best friends , and i do not have friends that are girls .
well , i' m glad , because your happiness means a lot to me .
it does ?
sure .
i saw how hard your breakup with folette was .
yeah .
i think we both know what it feels like to be lonely .
whatever .
the thing is , i' d really like to see you settled .
where are we going ?
i knew it .
i knew it .
you knew what ?
that you were totally sprung on me .
hello ?
don' t you mean tai ?
tai ?
her picture' s in your locker .
the picture you took is in my locker .
oh , i' m having a twin peaks experience .
i knew it when you kissed me .
suck and blow is a game , elton .
i know it' s a game .
stop it !
fine .
you know , i don' t get you , cher .
you flirt with me all year ...
as if !
i have been trying to get you with tai !
tai ?
why would i go with tai ?
why not ?
why not ?
don' t you even know who my father is ?
you are a snob and a half .
cher , listen to me .
me and tai ... we don' t make any sense .
all right ?
me and ... and you ... well , i mean ... it makes sense .
cut it out !
come on !
stop it !
cher !
where you going ?
you' re only hurting yourself here , baby .
you going to walk home ?
get back in the car , please .
get back in the car .
leave me alone !
fine !
hey !
where are you going ?
oh , shit !
valley information .
do you have a number of a cab company ?
which one ?
i don' t know .
what do you have ?
hand it over .
give me the phone .
o. k. the bag , too .
come on !
all right .
now , uh ... get down on the ground face down .
come on !
oh , no .
you don' t understand .
this is an alaia .
an a what a ?
it' s , like , a totally important designer .
i will totally shoot you in the head .
get down !
that' s good .
yeah .
all right .
um ...
count to 100 .
thank you .
1 ... 2 ... 3 ...
the evening had turned into a royal mess ... sexually harassed , robbed .
i didn' t know the number of the party , so i couldn' t call dionne , and daddy would kill me if he knew where i was .
there was just one person left to call , and i really , really didn' t want to call him .
come on .
hello ?
josh , you busy ?
it' s mel' s daughter .
i was at this party , and my designated driver tried to attack me .
i got out , but then he drove off and deserted me .
then this guy with a gun held me up , took my money and my phone , yelled at me , and forced me to ruin my dress .
o. k. o. k.
um , where are you ?
sun valley .
man , you owe me .
the man is ridiculous .
he doesn' t have one unique thought in his little , puny brain .
i think that there' s some merit in learning form straight off .
oh , josh , please !
he' s taken our minds at the most fecund point and restrained them before they' ve wandered through the garden of ideas .
it' s just like hamlet said ,
to thine own self be true .
no .
hamlet didn' t say that .
i think that i remember hamlet accurately .
well , i remember mel gibson accurately , and he didn' t say that .
that polonius guy did .
ha ha ha !
i' m going to walk heather to her door .
try and stay out of trouble .
ew !
my life is turning into a bigger disaster than malibu .
i didn' t know what i was going to say to tai .
i felt really nervous .
even fabian , my masseuse , said i had a lot of tension in my back .
it' s my hips , isn' t it ?
no , of course not .
don' t be stupid .
you could do so much better .
he thinks he' s all that , tai .
yeah .
god' s gift .
you' re too good for him .
if i' m too good for him , then how come i' m not with him ?
i have got an idea .
let' s blow off seventh and eighth , go to the mall , have a calorie fest , and see the new christian slater .
yes !
oh , you guys !
look at him .
ooh , baby .
break me off a piece of that .
ha ha ha !
survey says ?
doable .
puny .
i like them big .
oh , i hate muscles .
i don' t really care either way .
just as long as his you know what isn' t crooked .
i really hate that .
what ?
shh !
don' t scare her .
why ?
what' s wrong ?
cher is saving herself for luke perry .
cher , you' re a virgin ?
god !
you say it like it' s a bad thing .
besides , the pc term is hymenally challenged .
i am not interested in doing it until i find the right person .
you see how picky i am about my shoes .
they only go on my feet .
you' re one to talk , dee .
oh , wait a minute !
i thought that you and murray were ...
my man is satisfied .
he' s got no cause for complaints .
but technically , i am a virgin .
you know what i mean .
oh , god .
what' s wrong , tai ?
they' re playing our song ...
the one that elton and i danced to .
oh .
?
rollin ' with the homies ??
oh , tai .
don' t cry .
i' m sorry .
oh , my gosh .
stop !
i could tell tai' s grieving period would be considerable , unless i found someone to take elton' s place right away .
i don' t want to be a traitor to my generation , but i don' t get how guys dress today .
it looks like they just fell out of bed and put on some baggy pants and take their greasy hair ...
ugh !
and cover it up with a backwards cap , and , like , we' re expected to swoon ?
i don' t think so .
searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a pauly shore movie .
so this must be the elusive christian .
where should i park ?
there' s one .
third back .
o. k. o. k.
now , i know i said i would find a guy for tai , but i suppose there' s no harm in finding one for myself also .
nice stems .
thanks .
cher ?
present .
we established that during attendance .
it' s time for your oral .
excuse me ?
your original oral .
violence in the media .
oh !
so , o. k.
the attorney general says there' s too much violence on tv , and that should stop .
even if you took out all the violent shows , you could still see the news .
so until mankind is peaceful enough not to have violence on the news , there' s no point in taking it out of shows that need it for entertainment value .
thank you .
any comments ?
elton ?
my foot hurts .
can i go to the nurse ?
travis ?
two very enthusiastic thumbs up .
fine holiday fun .
hello ?
was i the only one listening ?
i mean , i thought it reeked .
i believe that was your designer impostor perfume .
i dug it .
during the next few days ,
i did what any normal girl would do .
i sent myself love letters and flowers and candy , just so he' d see how desired i was in case he didn' t already know . ?
he got the finest face i ever seen ? ?
and the body to go with it ? ?
i' m telling you , he' s mean ? ?
and my girlfriends be telling me ? ?
they be seeing him and he be asking about me ??
and anything you can do to draw attention to your mouth is good .
also , sometimes you have to show a little skin .
this reminds guys of being naked , and then they think of sex .
hey , duchess ?
yes ?
you rashin ' this weekend ?
huh ?
like saturday .
i' m new , but i thought maybe you had an in on the heavy clambakes .
well , my ex stepbrother' s friends are having a party .
solid .
daddy had an urgent case .
some clerks and josh helped him go through a gazillion depositions .
daddy !
what ?
i can' t open it .
i have to make him wait !
then he can wait outside .
josh , please !
come on , josh !
come on !
what do you hear ?
she' s not ready .
hey , man .
nice pile of bricks you got here .
you drink ?
no , thanks .
i' m cool .
i' m not offering .
i' m asking you if you drink .
you think i' d give alcohol to teenage drivers taking my daughter out ?
the protective vibe .
i dig .
you think the death of sammy davis
left an opening in the rat pack ?
christian .
doll face .
handsome .
stunning .
you' re not letting her go out like that , are you ?
cher , get in here .
what' s up ?
what the hell is that ?
a dress .
says who ?
calvin klein .
it looks like underwear .
go upstairs and put something over it .
tscha !
i was just going to .
hey , you .
anything happens to my daughter ,
i got a . 45 and a shovel .
i doubt anybody would miss you .
bye , daddy .
come on .
oh , it' s so killer !
thank you .
your dad is pretty scary .
isn' t he ?
you like billie holiday ?
i love him .
right .
?
who do you think is coming to town ?? ?
you' il never guess who ? ?
lovable , hugable ... ??
i didn' t like him .
what' s to like ?
maybe i should go to the party .
if you feel like you should go ...
you don' t need me , do you ?
no , no .
josh , go to the party .
go , go , go .
o. k.
uh ...
i' il watch her for you .
o. k.
you do that .
?
there was a place ? ?
and the name of the place escapes me ? ?
when i can' t remember , it irritates me ? ?
could be i can' t remember ? ?
could be i choose to not ? ?
let' s move along the song and try to find the plot ? ?
there was a girl ? ?
and i don' t know her name , either ? ?
she gave me love , and i said i' d never leave her ? ?
and if i did , i' d come back someday and find her ? ?
maybe i will , i should write up a reminder ? ?
one day ? ?
one day , who knows ?? ?
someday ?
?
someday i suppose ... ??
tai !
whoa !
oh , my god !
tai , are you o. k. ?
shit !
that is so embarrassing !
no one saw it .
now all night long , i' il be known as that girl who fell on her butt .
wow !
are you o. k. ?
that looked really bad .
yeah .
thanks .
oh , my god , cher .
look .
he' s going with amber ?
no .
he' s probably just dancing with her .
do you think she' s pretty ?
no .
she' s a monet .
what' s a monet ?
it' s like the paintings , see ?
from far away , it' s o. k.
up close , it' s a big old mess .
christian , what do you think of amber ?
hagsville .
see ?
they' re charging for brewskies .
pass me a fin , i' il pay you back ?
sure .
thanks .
oh , he' s so cute .
oh , my god .
do you see how he' s falling in love with me ?
i mean , look how he ignores every other girl .
oh , god , look .
there' s josh .
he finds the only adult in here ,
like he' s deliberately trying to not have fun .
cher , i have a question .
what should i do with this thing ?
should i tie it around or put it over ...
tie it around your waist .
ready to slide ?
let' s go .
?
where did you go ?? ?
where did you go ?? ?
where did you go ?? ?
where did you go ?? ?
where did you go ?? ?
you played a tape i couldn' t hear ? ?
emptiness began to roam , and where did you go ??
the band was kickin ' , and christian was the hottest guy there .
but my enjoyment was put on pause when i saw how unhappy tai was . ? ... wish you sent me this would end ? ?
wrote a note , then tore it up ? ?
poured the beer into a cup , sat on the couch ? ?
drank and smoked , wondering where did you go ... ??
hi .
hi .
i think we were born to move .
look !
josh is dancing with tai !
he never dances !
i can see why .
no .
he' s doing her a prop so she won' t be left out .
oh , i dig you .
?
get on the floor , and let' s dance some more ? ?
get on the floor , and let' s dance some more ? ?
get on the floor , and let' s dance some more ? ?
get on the floor , and let' s dance some more ??
how are you guys holding up ?
i am so ready to leave .
i' m tired .
let' s get christian and go .
christian !
you want to go ?
now ?
these guys got the skinny on the happening after hours .
my trainer' s coming really early .
i can take the girls home .
no .
that' s all right .
thanks .
no .
it' s fine .
stay .
you sure ?
yeah , sure .
thanks , man .
you got my mark .
you are a down girl .
i' il call you tomorrow .
it was really decent of you to dance with tai .
my pleasure .
you notice any positive changes in her ?
yeah .
under your tutelage , she' s exploring the challenging world of bare midriffs .
so you didn' t want to make a night of it with the ring a ding kid ?
daddy won' t go too ballistic .
it' s not like he' il sleep .
not if they' re going to finish those depos .
it would be dope if we got some really delicious take out .
i bet they haven' t eaten all night .
that would be pretty ... dope of us .
let' s do it .
the midnight snack totally revived the lawyers , and daddy was way grateful .
eat oranges .
get vitamin c.
daddy , no !
cher , come on .
you can' t have that .
i know it sounds mental , but sometimes i have more fun vegging out than when i go partying .
maybe because my party clothes are so binding .
how many hours a day do you spend grooming yourself ?
some people aren' t lucky enough to be as naturally adorable as you are .
stop it .
you' re making me blush .
hello .
hi , cher .
how are you ?
hi , gail .
is my son there , cleaning out your refrigerator ?
no , no , he' s not here .
you should try the dorms .
all right .
bye , hon .
bye bye .
what was that all about ?
she wants me to come home for spring break .
so ?
nobody will be in school .
husband number four' s at home , and his idea of acting like a family is to criticize me .
you' re going to roam around campus by yourself ?
i don' t mind .
that is stupid .
come here .
have your old room .
there will be some great parties .
no .
why not ?
you got your whole social world going on .
i' d get in the way .
you won' t be in the way .
how much fun would it be having a brother type tagging along ?
josh , you' re not my brother .
you know what i mean .
come on .
you need some excitement in your life .
it will replenish you for your finals .
o. k.
good .
i can' t believe i' m taking advice from someone who watches cartoons .
be quiet , you idiot !
that' s ren & stimpy .
they' re way existential .
do you have any idea what you' re talking about ?
no .
why , do i sound like i do ?
ha ha !
a space odyssey playing ]
christian said he' d call the next day .
in boy time , that meant thursday .
you can imagine my astonishment to hear from him while i was packing daddy up .
he said he' d come over with some videotapes .
a night alone with christian ?
i sent for reinforcements .
then dee and i had to design a lighting concept .
and costume decisions .
i don' t rely on mirrors , so i always take polaroids . ?
and you' re the one i' ve always planned to be ... ?
whenever a boy comes , you should always have something baking . ?
i believe i' m you ? ?
yes , i do ? ?
i believe i' m you ? ?
you know it' s true ??
oh ...
i' m still all red !
i' m trying to make you as white as i can , cher .
look , you' re all flushed .
you have to calm down , o. k. ?
calm .
you know , i am so glad i never did it with someone i had lukewarm feelings for because christian is brutally hot , and i am going to remember tonight forever .
blot .
hi .
hi .
is something burning ?
oh , my god !
oops .
aw , honey , you baked .
i tried .
come on .
show me the rest of your pad .
your father has a well rounded collection .
daddy says it' s a good investment .
he' s absolutely right .
claes oldenburg .
he' s way famous .
ooh .
but this is older , see ?
transitional .
a very important piece .
um , you want to go swimming ?
mmm .
let' s watch the movies .
oh , o. k.
christian had a thing for tony curtis , so he brought over some like it hot and sparatacus .
singer of songs .
for whom did you practice this wondrous talent ?
for the children of my master , whom i also taught the classics .
classics , indeed ?
what position have we , i wonder , for a boy of such varied gifts ?
you shall be my body servant .
all of you , come with me .
my feet are cold .
huh .
thanks .
oh , watch this part .
this is good .
are you o. k. ?
uh , i' m fine .
um , do you want some ... something to drink ?
i could get you some wine .
no .
you notice how wine makes people want to feel , like , sexy ?
well , that' s o. k.
i' m actually getting tired .
but i can make you some coffee if you' d like .
oh , no , thanks .
got the ulcer .
but you had all those cappuccinos before .
oh .
well , you know , that was , like , uh , foam .
you' re great .
we' re friends , right ?
yeah .
knock me a little kiss .
see you .
i don' t get it .
did my hair get flat ?
did i stumble into some bad lighting ?
what' s wrong with me ?
nothing .
maybe he really was tired .
i suppose it wasn' t meant to be .
he does dress better than i do .
what would i bring to the relationship ?
get back into the right lane ...
what' s the first thing you do ?
first thing i do is put on my blinker .
oh , wait .
shit .
watch the road !
stop .
then i look in my mirror .
o. k.
then i glance at my blind spot .
with your head , not the whole car !
i swear to god .
i swear to god , woman !
you can' t drive for shit !
i' m not trying to hear that .
hear me !
you ...
actually , going all the way is , like , a really big decision .
i can' t believe i was so capricious about it .
dee , i almost had sex with him .
you almost had sex with who ?
christian .
what ?
yo , look !
are you bitches blind or something ?
your man christian is a cake boy .
a what ?
a what ?
he' s a disco dancing , oscar wilde reading ,
streisand ticket holding friend of dorothy .
uh uh .
no way .
he' s gay .
not even .
yes , even .
he does like to shop , cher , and the boy can dress .
oh , my god .
i' m totally buggin ' .
i feel like such a bonehead .
what the hell ?
yo !
you' re getting on the freeway !
turn right !
get out of the lane !
no , no !
forget procedure !
get out of the lane !
truck !
truck !
truck !
we' re on the freeway !
what do i do , murray ?
go straight !
go straight !
go straight !
oh , shit !
just relax and drive , baby .
just relax and drive .
o. k.
i' m here with you .
i' m here with you .
shut up !
aah !
aah !
aah !
whatever you do , keep your hands on the wheel at all times !
aah !
look , just go !
aah !
go to the right !
oh , there it is .
all right , we' re off .
woo !
damn .
you did wonderful .
it' s all right , baby .
relax , relax , relax .
honey , relax .
baby , relax .
breathe , breathe .
breathe in .
breathe .
let it out .
breathe , breathe , breathe .
relax , relax .
boy , getting off the freeway makes you realize how important love is .
after that , dionne' s virginity went from technical to nonexistent .
i realized how much i wanted a boyfriend of my own .
not that christian wasn' t a blast to hang out with .
he was becoming one of my favorite shopping partners .
so was the red .
um , where' s tai ?
she met some random guys at the foot locker and escorted them right over there .
oh , my god !
did you ...
i don' t know where she meets these barneys .
i have a question , all right ?
what ?
the jacket ...
is it james dean or jason priestley ?
carpe diem , o. k. ?
you looked hot in it .
really ?
if i fall , would you guys catch me ?
could they please be more generic ?
aah !
stop it !
please !
bring me back up !
aah !
aah !
let me down !
thank you .
you asshole !
hey , man , we' re just joking .
oh , really ?
somebody could get killed .
oh , my god .
cher , you don' t understand .
i was sitting there .
i was just talking to those guys .
all of a sudden , we were laughing and ...
hey , you o. k. ?
y yeah .
you sure ?
i' m fine .
uh huh .
let' s get you home for some r and r.
what' s that ?
boy , considering how clueless she was ,
tai certainly had that damsel in distress act down .
meanwhile , back at school , everyone was talking about
tai' s brush with death at the mall .
was it a montage of all the scenes in your life ?
not exactly a montage .
hey , cher , is it true gang members tried to shoot tai ?
no .
that' s what everyone' s saying .
whatever .
when i was 9 , i fell off this jungle gym .
i swear i saw this ...
will you move down for cher ?
tell me more .
tell me more .
where was i ?
you were thinking about what was really important .
oh , right , right .
right before you die , your mind just sort of gets very clear .
it' s a very intense spiritual thing .
i know when i was held at gunpoint ...
excuse me .
you were saying ?
it' s spiritual .
i can' t pinpoint the spirituality .
if you' ve never experienced anything ...
tai , i was planning on going to tower and getting something for christian .
uh huh .
like some kind of present or something .
you want to come ?
sure .
i owe him my life .
i' il get you after school .
yeah .
not today .
i' m going over to melrose with amber .
we' re going to melrose .
oh .
well , how about tomorrow ?
do you think we could do it next monday ?
my week' s filling up fast here .
when we got back from the ihop , it was 8 : 00 .
here comes your boyfriend .
tai , check it out .
ew !
ew !
hey , could you shove down a little bit ?
no .
don' t the slackers prefer that grassy knoll over there ?
tai , so anyway , have you ever done it in water ?
oh , yeah .
really ?
what was happening ?
dionne asking tai for sex advice ?
tai being the most popular girl in the school ?
it was like some sort of alternate universe .
on top of everything else ,
i was going to take the driving test , so i had to find my most responsible looking ensemble .
where' s my white collarless shirt ?
lucy , where' s my shirt ?
probably at the cleaner .
oh , but today' s the driving test .
it' s my most capable looking outfit .
o. k. , i call them .
oh , it' s too late now .
oh , we got another notice from the fire department , saying we have to clear out the bush .
you said jose would do it .
he your gardener .
you tell him .
lucy , i don' t speak mexican .
i not a mexican !
great .
what was that all about ?
lucy' s from el salvador .
so ?
it' s an entirely different country .
what does that matter ?
you get upset if someone thinks you live below sunset .
so everything is all my fault .
i' m always wrong , right ?
you' re such a brat .
i had an overwhelming sense of ickyness .
even though i apologized to lucy , something was still plaguing me .
like josh thinking i was mean was making me postal .
move into the right lane .
anyway , why should i care what josh thinks ?
why was i letting it throw me into such turmoil ?
watch out for the bike rid ...
oops !
my bad .
what are you doing ?
you can' t take up both lanes .
get in the right lane .
not so ...
ooh !
should i write them a note ?
pull over up here and turn off the engine .
right there .
oh !
are you going to take me somewhere to make left hand turns ?
we' re going back .
it' s over ?
it' s over .
well , how did i do ?
how did you do ?
well , let' s see , shall we ?
you can' t park , you can' t switch lanes , you can' t make right hand turns , you' ve damaged private property , and you almost killed someone .
offhand , i' d say you failed .
failed ?
well , can' t we just start over ?
i mean , i' m kind of having a personal problem .
my mind was somewhere else .
that biker came out of nowhere !
oh !
i swear i' il concentrate !
i drive really good , usually .
isn' t there somebody else i can talk to ?
you can' t be the absolute and final word in driver' s licenses .
girlie , as far as you' re concerned ,
i' m the messiah of the dmv .
now , get out of the car .
i can' t believe i failed .
i failed something i couldn' t talk my way out of ?
go ahead , yeah .
put your legs into me .
hey , you' re home .
how does it feel to have a license ?
i wouldn' t know .
i failed .
oh .
bummer .
and , josh , spare me your lectures on how driving is such a big responsibility and you can' t b. s. your way through it .
i didn' t say anything .
i know what you' re thinking .
i got to tell you something .
i' m really sorry about your test .
i am so glad you' re here .
there' s something i got to do .
i need you here .
does this work ?
yeah .
what is this stuff ?
a bunch of junk that reminded me of elton .
i want to burn it because i' m so over him .
what stuff ?
do you remember when we were at the val party and the clog knocking me out and elton got a towel of ice ?
i didn' t tell you at the time , but i took the towel as a souvenir .
you' re kidding .
no .
and then ... remember that song that was playing when we danced ?
remember that ?
you know , rollin ' with the homies .
anyways , i got the tape , right ?
i listened to it , like , every single night .
don' t burn that , o. k. ?
tai , i' m really happy for you , but what brought on this surge of empowerment ?
it' s , like , i met this guy who' s so totally amazing that he makes elton look like a loser .
that is so great .
look , you' ve got to help me get josh .
get josh what ?
you know what i mean ?
i like him .
do you think that he likes you ?
yeah .
how do you know ?
like , little things , you know ?
like , he always finds some sort of way to touch me or tickle me .
do you remember the time at the frat when i was totally depressed ?
we danced , and he was really flirty .
you o. k. ?
yeah .
oh , actually ...
i was really bad today .
i had two mochaccinos .
i feel like ralphing .
i know exactly how that feels .
like , the other day , i was talking to josh , and we were discussing the difference between high school girls and college girls .
college girls wear less makeup .
that' s why guys like them more .
but , tai , do you really think you' d be good with josh ?
i mean , he' s , like , a school nerd .
am i some sort of a mentally challenged airhead ?
no !
not even !
i didn' t say that .
i' m not good enough for josh or something ?
i ...
i just ... don' t think you mesh well together .
you don' t think that we mesh well ?
why am i even listening to you to begin with ?
you' re a virgin who can' t drive .
oh , that was way harsh , tai .
all right .
look , i' m really sorry .
let' s just talk when we' ve mellowed , all right ?
i' m audi .
what did i do ?
i' ve created some sort of a monster .
i could feel the chunks start to rise up in my throat .
i had to get out .
?
when i was young ? ?
i never needed anyone ?
everything i think and everything i do is wrong .
i was wrong about elton .
i was wrong about christian .
now josh hated me .
it all boiled down to one inevitable conclusion ...
i was just totally clueless .
oh , and this josh and tai thing was wiggin ' me more than anything .
what was my problem ?
tai is my pal .
i don' t begrudge her a boyfriend .
i really ...
ooh !
i wonder if they have that in my size .
what does she want with josh anyway ?
he dresses funny .
he listens to complaint rock .
he' s not even cute ... in a conventional way .
i mean , he' s just like this slug who hangs around the house all the time .
and he' s a hideous dancer .
couldn' t take him anywhere .
wait a second .
what am i stressing about ?
this is , like , josh . ?
all by myself ??
o. k. , o. k. , so he' s kind of a baldwin .
what would he want with tai ?
she couldn' t make him happy .
josh needs someone with imagination , someone to take care of him , someone to laugh at his jokes ... in case he ever makes any .
then suddenly ...
oh , my god .
i love josh .
i am majorly , totally , crazy in love with josh .
but now i don' t know how to act around him .
i mean , ordinarily , i' d strut around him in my cutest little outfits and send myself flowers and candy , but i couldn' t do that stuff with josh .
what' s with you ?
what do you mean ?
you' re so quiet .
you haven' t made me watch the real world .
i care about the news .
since when ?
since now . ... ln central bosnia .
you look confused .
well , uh , i thought they declared peace in the middle east .
cher , get in here !
what' s up , daddy ?
what are you doing dancing in front of my office ?
nothing .
i just wanted to see if you need any help with anything .
yeah , you can help me with something .
come over here .
all right .
every time that you see a telephone conversation that took place on september 3rd , highlight it .
just september 3rd .
o. k.
it' s fun , huh ?
yeah .
o. k.
daddy , did you ever have a problem that you couldn' t argue your way out of ?
tell me the problem , and we' il figure out how to argue it .
i like this boy , and he likes someone else .
how could that be ?
i don' t know .
i feel wretched .
obviously , this boy is a complete moron .
you are the most beautiful girl in beverly hills .
and to tell you the truth ,
i' m not sure i want you with a stupid fellow .
well , actually , he is a smart guy .
he' s one of those do gooder types .
i feel like my after school commitments aren' t good enough .
how can you say that ?
who takes care of everyone in this household ?
who makes sure that daddy eats right ?
i have not seen such good doing since your mother .
really ?
really .
now , get back to work .
later , while we were learning about the pismo beach disaster ,
i decided i needed a complete makeover , except this time , i' d makeover my soul .
but what makes somebody a better person ?
then i realized all my friends were good in different ways .
like christian , he always wants things to be beautiful and interesting .
or dionne and murray , when they think no one is watching , are so considerate of each other .
and poor miss geist , always trying to get us involved no matter how much we resist .
oh .
that' s just ...
that doesn' t even show ...
every single possession , every memory , everything you' ve had your whole life gone in a second .
can you imagine what that must feel like ?
elton ?
can i use the pass ?
yeah .
we' il be collecting blankets , disposable diapers , uh , canned goods .
miss geist ?
cher ?
i want to help .
that would be wonderful .
i felt better already .
daddy !
what ?
you didn' t like that red caviar , did you ?
what' s she talking about ?
ew !
cher , what are you doing ?
i' m captain of the pismo beach disaster relief .
i don' t think they need your skis .
daddy , some people lost all their belongings .
don' t you think that includes athletic equipment ?
this is your influence , josh ?
?
shake , some action' s what i need ? ?
to make a bus stop at full speed ? ?
and i' m sure that' s all you' il need ? ?
to make it all right ?? ... really fun .
it' s so pretty .
should i leave it here ?
could you bring it to bedding ?
thank you very much .
oh , miss geist , i need more boxes .
they' re all filled up .
already ?
great .
i divided them into entrees and appetizers .
oh .
o. k. i' il have them picked up .
uh !
hey .
proper .
this is really decent of you , travis .
sure .
i wasn' t sure about that .
i don' t need it anymore , but far be it for me to deny anyone else .
i' m sorry about your shoes .
what shoes ?
the red ones with the strappy thing .
oh , those are so last season .
what made you think of them ?
it' s one of my steps .
i joined this club , and there are these steps .
there' s , like ... 12 ?
yeah .
how did you know ?
wild guess .
wow .
good guess .
uh , also , here .
asl .
amateur skateboarding league .
this clarity thing , it' s brought me to a whole new level .
my skating ...
would you come saturday ?
sure .
ah , cool .
ha ha !
well , um , i guess kitchenware ?
that' s where i used to keep it .
hi .
hi .
cher , can i talk to you a minute ?
um , sure .
look , i have been in agony for the past week .
i can' t believe i went off the way i did .
no .
i have been going down a shame spiral .
i can' t believe i was so unsupportive of your feelings for josh .
you' re entitled to your opinion .
i' m the tard here .
cher , you' ve been nothing but super duper nice to me .
if it wasn' t for me , you wouldn' t have liked elton .
i' m so sorry , tai .
i' m really sorry .
oh , shit .
now i' m going to go ahead and cry .
let' s never fight again , o. k. ?
next up , number 14 , travis birkenstock .
woo !
all right , travis !
i had no idea he was so motivated .
oh , i did .
when i saw the sparks between tai and travis ,
i knew josh was out of the picture .
you look like pippi longstocking .
you look like forrest gump .
who' s pippi longstocking ?
uh , someone mel gibson never played .
you' re funny .
what happened to the august 28th files ?
hmm ?
what ?
mel wanted them tonight .
there were twice as many .
he' s going to go ballistic .
where are they ?
i think i checked them for the september 3rd conversations .
what ?
where' d you put them ?
i divided them into two piles .
i have to redo all that .
are you some kind of idiot ?
hey , she didn' t know .
she just set us back a day .
who cares about the september call ?
i' m sorry .
just forget it .
just go back to the mall or something .
what' s your problem , man ?
she didn' t mean any harm .
i' il get killed ' cause she' s a moron .
she' s not a moron .
if you were paying attention , it wouldn' t have happened .
if you hadn' t have been playing footsie , she wouldn' t be bothering me .
what the hell are you talking about ?
this is a multimillion dollar lawsuit , not some excuse for puppy love .
we' ve worked our butts off on this case !
do whatever you want with your butts .
i' m calling in sick .
did i really ruin daddy' s lawsuit ?
no .
of course not .
well , did i set him back ?
i mean , there' s so much work to be done , and he can' t afford to lose that time .
don' t worry .
i' il take care of it .
your father won' t lose any time .
can you imagine the nerve of that guy ?
i mean , making you worry like that .
he' s the one that screwed up .
then he goes and blames us .
imagine saying we were ... you know .
that' s right .
you' ve been very dedicated to this case .
yeah .
well , it was a good learning experience .
at least for me .
i want to be a lawyer .
but you , i mean , you don' t need to be doing this .
go out and have fun .
go shopping .
you think that' s all i do ?
i' m just a ditz with a credit card ?
no , no .
that' s not what i meant .
it' s just ... um ...
uh , th ...
you' re ... young and beautiful and ...
and ?
and , uh , well , what ?
you think i' m beautiful ?
mmm ... yeah , a little .
you know you' re gorgeous , all right ?
and popular and , uh , and ... but this is not why i come here .
this is a good learning experience for me .
you already said that .
mel .
i want to help out mel .
he' s the only one who cares about me .
that' s not true .
he' s not ?
no .
are you saying ... you care about me ?
josh .
well , you can guess what happened next .
as if !
i am only 16 .
this is california , not kentucky .
you may kiss the bride .
i know that when i have my own wedding ,
i want this , like , whole , entire floral motif ,
like , very floral garlands .
no , no , no .
when i get married , i' il have a sailor dress , but it will be a gown .
my bridesmaids will wear sailor hats .
they' re planning our weddings already .
could you all stop that till death do us part mumbo jumbo ?
i' m completely buggin ' .
i' m buggin ' myself .
