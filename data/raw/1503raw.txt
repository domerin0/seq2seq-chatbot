you know mom hates when i' m late .
i told you ... we should have left earlier .
it' s the same damn thing every year .
where are my blue shoes , dear ?
dad , i can' t find my marilyn bronson cd .
marilyn manson .
whatever her name is .
she' s a guy , dad .
marilyn ?
a guy ?
what' s the world coming to ?
oh , boy ...
are you all right , darling ?
yeah .
dad !
dad !
oh , god !
my god , what happened ?
are we there yet ?
is anybody hurt ?
marion , are you okay ?
are you crazy ?
you almost killed us !
i' m sorry .
i must have dozed off .
i hope you slept well .
maybe i should whip you up some breakfast .
nobody is hurt .
get off my back , all right ?
for pete' s sakes , why don' t you let someone else drive , for once ?
don' t worry .
that woke me up .
the pie is probably ruined .
oh , jesus !
what is that ?
it' s pumpkin and chocolate .
smells like ass .
i' d better go out and check the car .
the son of a bitch didn' t even stop !
where are we ?
we' re on the road .
what does it look like ?
what happened to the interstate ?
i thought we could take the back way for a change .
what' s wrong with the interstate ?
we' ve taken it for years !
i was bored .
and i didn' t wanna ... fall asleep .
that seemed to work .
all right .
car looks okay .
no damage .
want me to take the wheel , dad ?
no , thank you , dear .
i' m growing attached to this car .
here we go again .
did you or did you not put the mercedes in the junkyard ?
it wasn' t my fault !
i' m just teasing you , sweetheart .
there certainly aren' t very many people on this road .
it' s christmas eve .
most people are at home , with their families .
damn , i' m starving !
me too .
i hope your mother doesn' t get experimental with that turkey .
look , can we drop the subject ?
i don' t feel very good .
are you okay , honey bunny ?
you want us to stop ?
long car rides make me queasy .
and all this talk food isn' t helping any .
how about a couple of bookers ?
shut up , richard !
or some macaroni and dick cheese .
richard , that' s disgusting !
but , mom , there really is a cheese called dick cheese .
chinese make it .
you' ve had dick cheese before , right , brad ?
grow up , richard .
it' s 7 : 30 already , darling .
i' m aware of that , laura .
i thought we' d come to a junction by now .
jesus , laura , do you have to suck on it like that ?
that' s the way i drink .
all right , you guys .
calm down .
take it easy .
marion is right .
when i played baseball , they taught us this technique to help us relax .
i still use it sometimes .
you breathe in deeply through your nose and out through your mouth .
thank you , brad .
yeah , thanks , brad .
can i ask you a question , though ?
sure .
was your entire school gay , or was it just the baseball team ?
richard !
what ?
richard , it' s a technique we use to helps us get in what we call ... ... " the zone " .
the homo zone ?
richard !
this is such a beautiful night !
does anybody know the name of that really bright star right in front of us ?
there' s 150 billion stars up there , for christ' s sake .
that one i know .
that bright one is the north star .
the only one i know .
thank you .
let' s sing a song , everybody .
okay .
what ?
how about " yellow submarine " ?
we always do that one .
brad , how about " y. m. c. a " ?
it' s christmas , so how about ...
jingle bells " ?
come on .
come on .
you like that part , don' t you ?
why did you stop ?
a woman .
i saw a woman in the forest .
cool .
dad is tripping out .
richard .
are you sure , dad ?
well , yeah .
dressed in white .
she was holding something .
fuck !
hi there .
we are a little lost .
you wouldn' t happen to know the quickest way back to the highway ?
are you all right ?
did you have an accident or something ?
okay .
anybody got a cell phone ?
no signal .
we just passed the cabin .
maybe there' s a phone .
richard , be a gentleman and make room for her .
let brad be the gentleman .
what' s your problem , man ?
relax , buddy .
breath in slowly through your nose and out deeply through your ass !
it' s all right , mrs. harrington .
i' il walk .
i could use the fresh air , anyway .
you' re not walking by yourself .
i wanna be alone .
marion !
let me tell you something , smart guy .
what ?
keep busting my balls and i' il take you out of the game for good .
understand me ?
yes , sir !
we' il meet you down there in just a minute .
okay , honey ?
okay .
all right .
okay , we' il see you there , honey .
shit !
would you like a nice hot cup of coffee ?
i think she' s in shock .
we should have asked marion what to do .
honey , we don' t need a shrink .
we' il call 911 .
okay .
they' il know how to handle it .
damn !
fucking stinks in here .
it' s the baby ... jack ass .
where are you going , sweetie ?
away from you guys .
teenagers .
what' s your name ?
where do you live ?
she' s not gonna be much help .
no .
hello , miss july .
does anybody live here ?
maybe it' s one of those old forest ranger stations .
jesus , laura .
you scared the shit out of me .
sorry .
they have very interesting wall hangings , these rangers .
so , what' s his name ?
do it , baby .
you got a ring .
you married ?
marion and i are getting married .
actually ... don' t say anything but i' m proposing to her tonight at her grandmother' s .
remember when you said you would kill yourself if i ever left you ?
i hope that was just a figure of speech , ' cause ...
brad , we' ve had some great times together , but ...
i think we need to go on with our lives separately .
shit .
damn !
was there no dial tone ?
nao , laura , i just forgot the number for 911 .
it' s amy .
my little girl .
her name is amy .
she' s so cold .
not surprised .
it' s freezing here .
you hold her .
no .
i' m not really a baby kind of guy .
how does she breathe with all those blanket on her face ?
don' t worry .
she' s dead .
that' s a good one .

yes .
i don' t get that !
why ...
i saw him .
they were hurting him .
you have to stop them !
okay !
where the hell did they go ?
maybe they took a side road .

laura , give me the flashlight , please .

oh , god !
richard , get your sister back in the car now .

jesus christ ...
what is he doing ?
he' s trying to get brad' s phone .
with a stick ?
you got a better idea ?
i can' t believe i' m gonna do this .

oh , god ...

laura !

can' t you see she' s in shock ?
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
dad , that guy ... or whoever did that ... ... must' ve used an axe or a chainsaw .
it was the work of one sick psycho .
let' s get the hell out of here .
wait .
what about that woman ?
maybe she got away .
maybe the psycho got her .
so , you wanna go after him ?
richard , get in .
we' re going to the police .
why don' t we go back to interstate ?
your mother lives by the sheriff' s .
we' il be there in 15 minutes .
marcott ?
never heard of it .
richard , check the map .
marcott ...
gimme a second .
there' s no marcott on this map .
just give it to me .
i don' t see it either .
maybe that' s because it' s not there !
laura , give me the local map .
i didn' t bring it .
you didn' t bring it ?
we never needed it before .
i asked you to .
remember ?
i had a lot of things to take care of .
the presents and ...
who gives a fuck about presents ?
would you please watch your language ?
i' m sorry , but how was i supposed to know you' re gonna take a shortcut ?
and how was i supposed to know that you were going to forget the map ?
we' ve been coming here for 20 years , and you' d never taken a shortcut .
i' il bring a globe in case you feel like driving by way of the north pole !
is there any coffee left ?
a little .
okay .
pour me some .
let' s go to marcott , then .
is anybody else a bit freaked out we are the only car in the road now ?
it' s christmas eve .
yeah .
okay .
how long have we been driving ?
it' s 7 : 30 .
you said it was 7 : 30 when we took that lady into the car .
that damn thing is broken .
all right .
who' s got a watch ?
i have a watch .
it stopped at 7 : 30 .
come on .
don' t you guys think that this is just a little wacked ?
i know you guys think i' m retarded or whatever ... but i have a theory and i want you to hear me out , okay ?
brad is dead .
his body is mutilated and god knows how it got that way .
we are the only people out here and all the clocks have stopped at 7 : 30 .
this reeks of alien activity , you guys .
blow me .
what ?
nothing .
laura ... can you make her stop that , please ?
let her .
maybe it will help .
it' s getting on my nerves .
i can' t believe i fell asleep .
how long was i out ?
i don' t know .
maybe 10 minutes .
are we still on that same road ?
still no marcott ?
no .
no marcott .
i don' t understand .
did we pass it ?
no , i haven' t seen anything .
no lights , no signs , no nothing .
shit !
what is that ?
it' s a baby carriage .
i can see it' s a baby carriage .
okay .
i' il get out and i' il go see .
no .
don' t .
why ?
just get going .
i don' t like this .
richard , come back here !
richard !
stop yelling in my ear !
richard , come back here !
hey , little guy !
richard !
frank , no !
you guys suck !
i' m gonna kill that kid .
oh , god !
what the hell was that ?
man , that was good !
this is so not funny , richard !
it' s a baby carriage .
why fear ?
it' s empty .
no shit !
that is so not funny !
nice job .
that was dumb .
what is it now ?
i can' t stop thinking about diane .
how are we gonna tell her about brad ?
he was our responsibility .
i don' t wanna worry about that now !
i just wanna figure out some goddamn way to get out of here .
i' m sorry .
talk about a merry fucking christmas .
you are not gonna open that .
that' s my uncle herb' s present .
i need this a whole hell of a lot more than your uncle herb right now .
let' s face it .
we are lost , frank .
this road is not going to mom' s .
let' s turn around .
we should turn around , frank .
we just passed a sign .
marcott can' t be too far .
hey , sis .
mom ...
mom and dad are kinda going off the deep end , huh ?
they are really losing it .
this whole thing is pretty fucking crazy , huh ?
mare ?
mare ?
come on , you' ve gotta snap out of it , okay ?
you have to .
we need you back here .
i ...
i need you .
mom is always going on about what a great shrink you are , so ... you are the only person that can figure a way out of this .
damn it !
do you remember when your hamster disappeared ... and i told you it had been abducted by aliens ?
well , i lied .
okay ?
it was me .
me and kevin .
we stuck it in the microwave and we fried it .
marion ?
dad !
dad , it' s here again .
richard , i am fed up with your stupid jokes .
it wasn' t me this time .
i swear .
richard , we do not have time ...
christ !
i' m telling you the truth , your fucking assholes !
frank , would you say something for once ?
i think we' d better get out of here .
get going .
we should have passed a town or a gas station or ... a motel , or a crossroads , a junction , something by now !
i know .
i know .
just calm down , laura .
it' s probably one of those closed roads that forest rangers use .
god !
i just feel like we' ve been driving forever .
what is this forest ?
is this like the amazon ?
last year , i had to drive to lakewood to talk with a client and i went ... ... on a very roundabout way .
what you seem to do sometimes .
i was driving and driving until i had to turn back to the road i came from .
what are you talking about ?
some of these roads are designed ... by engineers who weren' t qualified to build a goddamn bird house !
so ?
so ?
that' s that !
that' s that ...
lakewood ?
isn' t there where sally schmidt bought her cottage ?
yeah , i think so .
jesus christ !
what was that ?
some kind of a radio talk show .
that was no talk show .
a public radio , or something .
public radio ?
right .
no !
damn it !
you just said it was public radio !
i don' t know what it was !
i don' t wanna know what it was !
i just wanna get to the police before anything else goes wrong .
and i thought last year' s christmas was bad .
and what was wrong with last year' s christmas ?
let' s see ...
everything ?
i thought last year was great !
we took the interstate !
i was talking about christmas dinner .
and what' s wrong with my family' s christmas dinners ?
your family .
your mother always felt you deserved more than a used car salesman .
now that salesman has become a respected sales manager .
so , i' m sorry , baby , but screw your mother !
anything else ?
your damn brother is a freak too !
he jerks off to gun magazines !
that is disgusting !
that is disgusting and that is not fair !
mikey has had a lot of hard times !
poor little mikey !
poor mikey !
wht do i have to suffer every time i talk to the son of a bitch ?
you are just so sensitive !
i know it' s christmas , laura .
i know it' s the season of giving , but i don' t give a shit right now !
i just wanna get off this goddamn road !
jesus !
mother of ... !
fuck !
oh , frank !
it' s okay , honey .
we just had a blow out .
okay .
i' m pregnant .
marion !
jesus christ !
i smoke pot .
i' m gonna go change the tire .
you handle that wrench like a whore handles a baby .
fucking do it yourself , man .
you watch your mouth , goddamn it .
all right .
you want some help ?
how is marion doing ?
she' s pregnant .
how are you ?
frankly , it' s been much for one night .
i' il say .
where did richard go ?
he' s probably off smoking a joint .
that is not funny !
our son is doing drugs !
please , laura .
can' t you see this is a cry for help ?
christ !
it' s just a joint , all right ?
not worse than those pills you take .
my pills are legal !
pregnant .
man , i hope it' s a boy .
what' s up , little critter ?
i' m your uncle dick .
that means you' d better show me some respect , huh ?
or i will fuck you up .
okay .
are you okay , honey bunny ?
don' t you ever call me that again .
okay .
okay , that' s fine .
that' s what brad called me .
uncle dick .
right on .
fuck !
i love you .
jesus !
okay .
i' m done .
let' s go .
richard , we' re going !
it' s the car !
oh , my god ...
open the door !
open the door !
open the door !
laura !
laura !
let' s go back and get the car !
dad !
dad !
richard !
richard !
come here !
laura , get in the car now !
frank ...
get in , we' il get him !
faster !
it doesn' t go any faster , laura !
where is he ?
i don' t know .
i can' t see him .
the son of a bitch shut off his lights !
they are gonna kill him .
no !
they are gonna kill him !
no , they won' t !
yes , they are !
calm down , mom !
he' il be all right !
i' il get him !
it was richard !
shut up !
damn it !
it was richard !
stop the car !
stop the car !
please ...
my baby !

what did they do to you ?
mom ...
come on .
come on , baby .
you can wake up .
come one , baby .
laura ...
laura ...
what ?
what ?
mom , he is ...
no !
no , no ...
this is one of his jokes , isn' t it ?
you' re just like your father .
remember the time that he took me to new orleans ?
we never went to new orleans .
' course not .
you' re not his father .
what ?
richard is not your son .
mom , what are you talking about ?
she' s out of her fucking mind .
i am not out of my mind .
don' t you remember alan rickson ?
laura ...
what ?
what ?
what did you say ?
you remember alan rickson ?
my baby .
i don' t wanna go .
i don' t wanna go .
please , let me stay with him .
come on .
let me stay ...
don' t take me from him !
oh , god !
please , i don' t wanna go .
please , frank ...
what are we gonna do ?
we gotta go to the police .
how are we gonna go to the police ?
we' re in the middle of nowhere .
come on .
let' s go , honey .
we can' t leave him here .
no , we won' t .
he was my son .
he goes with us .
what is it ?
it' s what uncle mike wanted for christmas .
thank god for the gun freak .
isn' t michael coming ?
michael ?
who the hell is michael ?
it' s richard .
his real name is michael .
because that is what alan wanted to call him .
richard is dead !
okay .
would you like some pie ?
it was that sign again .
how far is this fucking town ?
we' ve been driving for 100 miles .
what a wonderful christmas .
i wonder if i should save some pie for michael ?
do you think she' s gonna recover ?
i don' t know .
but she' s gonna have to face reality sooner or later .
what a wonderful chrismtas .
god only knows how she will react .
can' t be any worse .
it can be much worse .
look , i finished the pie .
could i have a pen , please ?
what for ?
i' m gonna do a drawing .
good , good .
here , my pen .
you are so beautiful , marion .
jesus !
let' s hope there' s a hospital in marcott .
what if we never reach marcott ?
what if she gets us first ?
who ?
the lady in white .
that woman with the baby ?
yeah , i saw her in the woods ... ... right after richard disappeared .
you saw her ?
and then i remembered the story my grandfather used to tell me .
used to creep me out every time i heard it .
look .
i made a drawing of brad .
this was his leg that was hanging out .
it' s for you .
okay , mom .
wipe your face .
there was this couple that was driving home from a wedding ... in rhode island .
it was night .
it was raining .
and they saw a little girl standing by the side of the road .
and she was just wandering back and forth , clutching the school book .
they stopped and they let her get into the back seat ... and they tried to talk to her , but she must have been in shock .
they were driving on down the road , all of a sudden they heard a scream ... coming from the back seat .
they slammed on the brakes , they nearly had an accident .
miraculously , they didn' t go over the cliff .
they turned to the back seat ... the little girl had vanished .
there was just her school book there , with her name on it .
barbara rose .
the entire rose family had died in a tragic car accident ... right at that cliff , five years earlier .
come on !
dad , what are you saying ?
that that woman is a ghost ?
look !
we' ve got potato chips !
i' il get them open .
i didn' t know we had them .
do you want some ?
mom , don' t eat them so fast .
you' re gonna make yourself sick .
i am not .
oh , god !
we' d better wake up from this nightmare pretty soon .
do you feel better , laura ?
dad , who' s alan rickson ?
i have no idea .
what was mom talking about ?
i never heard of any alan rickson .
she' s in shock .
she' s talking a whole lot of nonsense .
why would she do that ?
you tell me .
wow !
look what i found !
mom , put the gun down .
it' s dangerous .
it' s not .
it' s a toy !
it' s like the one michael used to have .
laura !
i was just kidding !
laura , that is a loaded gun .
put it down .
you are just trying to scare me .
i don' t wanna play with you anymore .
bang bang , you are dead !
okay .
okay , sweetheart .
you win .
i' m dead .
do something .
like what ?
you are the shrink .
student shrink .
marion ...
mom !
yes , darling .
we' il play something else now .
remember when we used to play house ?
i don' t wanna play that .
i wanna play what michael and i used to .
laura , this is not a game !
our son is dead !
no .
richard is dead !
dad !
holy shit !
the bitch shot me in the leg !
is he hurt ?
mom , go back to the car .
it' s gonna be all right .
is he gonna die too ?
nobody is gonna die anymore , okay ?
how does it look , doc ?
we' il see .
hold this .
hold this !
all right .
i have to get the pellets out .
okay .
light on the wound , please .
have you done this before ?
no , this is my first time .
shit !
light on the wound !
right .
okay , brace yourself .
why ?
brace yourself .
oh , god !
that hurt more than the shot !
okay , lift your leg up .
all right .
all right .
you should be all right now .
give me the keys .
i' il drive .
easy on the bottle there .
you know of a better pain killer ?
driving isn' t helping any .
it helps .
i don' t understand it .
we should have passed a side road by now .
your grandma' s place is probably miles behind us .
that' s it !
this must be a military road !
you think so ?
that' s why we never see military trucks .
always on roads isolated !
marcott must be a military base .
that' s why it' s not even on the map .
i guess so .
of course !
that' s it !
that' s it !
dad ?
dad !
it' s okay , honey .
i' m here .
i' m here .
thank god !
i thought that ...
your leg ...
are you okay ?
that' s not so bad .
i think we finally got some good news .
come here .
look .
earlier , i showed your mother the north star .
it was on our right side .
it still is .
that means we' ve been headed constantly west .
so , if we left the interstate somewhere around here ... and we headed constantly west on this road ... the road must go right straight to the sea .
marcott must be somewhere on the coast .
it makes perfect sense .
it must be a naval base .
okay , okay .
so how long until we get there ?
we have about half a tank of gas , we covered 150 miles on this road .
that leaves us another 40 or 50 miles until we get to the coast .
we can reach marcott within an hour , tops .
you' re a genius .
but you know , i' m more than a little concerned about your mother .
mom ?
you' re awake ?
i slept like a log .
how are you feeling ?
i feel ... okay ... considering ...
now we have got ... to stick together .
we have got to support each other in our grief .
would you like me to drive , darling ?
we should reach marcott soon .
oh , good !
you look not very well .
she' s okay .
frank , you know , you are a wonderful father .
and a wonderful husband too .
i want you to know that i understand about you and sally schmidt .
what ?
i know the whole thing .
i know how you two used to meet at the motel 6 on your lunch break .
it' s okay .
i completely understand .
i have never been able to fulfill ... your sexual fantasies .
and i want to promise you ... that when we get out of here , you can do anything you want to me , darling .
and i mean anything .
anyway , the most important thing ... is that the three of us come out of this stronger .
what do you think ?
not much .
good .
now ... there' s something that has been bothering me ever since i woke up .
what ?
who are these people in the woods ?
honey , slow down .
they are waving .
hi !
oh , my goodness , why do they look so sad ?
this is christmas eve .
smile !
they teach you what to do in this kind of situation ?
not to panic .
frank , do you really need to suck on that bottle like that ?
frank !
it' s jeannine !
quick , stop the car !
who is jeannine ?
she' s my friend !
who died 20 years ago .
and what exactly is your point ?
she' s dead .
so ?
so drop it !
if the dead are alive , maybe we should check out richard .
are you crazy ?
think he is comfortable back there ?
mom , if he was alive , don' t you think we would here him ?
your brother was burned alive .
how could he talk ?
shut up , laura !
easy , dad .
okay .
she' s driving me crazy .
could i go see jeannine now ?
no , you can' t !
yes , i can .
no , you can' t !
yes , i can .
no , you ...
i' m gonna go now .
oh , my god !
dad , stop the car !
mom !
laura !
laura !
mom !
laura !
mom !
oh , god !

marion ...
i' m gonna have a baby .
you can' t leave us .
you can' t leave us .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' ve already lost my mother ... and my brother and my boyfriend .
i don' t wanna lose you .
i don' t wanna lose you .
she' s gonna get us all anyway .
no .
no one is gonna get us , as long as we keep moving .
every time we' ve stopped , someone' s gotten killed .
we have to keep driving .
we are going to marcott .
let' s put your mother in the car .
you got a cigarette ?
in my coat .
alan rickson was a friend of mine , back in detroit .
you don' t have to say anything , dad .
then one day he came to me for some advice .
he said that he was in love with a woman .
didn' t mention her name .
he said that she was married and that she loved him too .
and he wanted to know what he should do about it .
and i remember what i said to him ...
you only live once , buddy .
go for it .
just go .
you go and you see her , and if she loves you ... she will leave her husband and she will go with you .
i' m sorry , dad .
only talked to him once after that .
he said the woman had decided she didn' t want to leave her husband .
she already had a kid .
a little girl .
she didn' t want to lose her .
last time i ever saw alan .
always wondered why he never kept in touch .
why did you do that ?
if you are scared , alcohol will only make it worse .
you think i' m scared ?
you don' t need to pretend .
it' s okay .
no , it' s not .
have you looked at the odometer lately ?
we' ve driven 60 miles since the last time we checked the map .
i know .
we should have reached the coast .
i know .
maybe i miscalculated a little bit .
maybe .
maybe the north star doesn' t indicate north .
maybe the map maker was drunk .
maybe the moon' s made out of cheese .
who knows ?
everything is so fucked up on this goddamn road !
after all , we don' t have to drive to get to marcott .
maybe there' s another way out .
like what , dad ?
flying ?
no .
walking .
through the woods .
this is insane .
agreed .
agreed .
you ready ?
we should at least wait until sunrise .
remember what you said ?
every time we stopped , somebody died .
let' s keep moving .
did you hear that ?
of course i heard that .
what is it ?
i don' t know .
we' re in the woods , dad .
it could be anything .
a branch falling , a rat or something , maybe a bird .
remember what laura said about all the faces in the forest ?
are there any ghosts in the woods tonight ?
come on , i' m waiting !
don' t ... ever , ever do that again .
you hear me ?
what is the matter with you ?
we shouldn' t have left the car .
that' s what' s the matter with me !
the more distance we put between us and the road , the better off we' il be .
goddamn !
shit !
shit !
shit !
are you all right ?
yeah , just dandy .
what the hell is that ?
you found us a fence !
a fence .
good , good .
there must be a farm on the other side .
it' s not that tight .
i' il hold it up .
you crawl under .
go on .
now you hold it for me .
okay .
dad !
look !
hello !
hello !
hello !
we' re here !
we' re here !
no !
no , it can' t be !
how can it be ?
how can ...
how can it be ?
maybe we got lost .
lf we were lost ... we would have come out at the same side of the road .
somebody is fucking with us .
calm down .
i don' t wanna calm down !
i want this shit to stop !
it' s still locked .
so what ?
so who turned on the lights ?
who turned them on ?
laura ?

i wanna do something ... cool .
