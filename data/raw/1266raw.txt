it' s stiii on , and we' re going .
cyrus sent an emissary this afternoon to make sure .
now , cyrus don' t want anybody packed .
he don' t want anybody flexing any muscle .
i gave him my word that the warriors would uphold the truce .
everybody says that cyrus is the one and only .
i think we' d better go have a iook for ourself .
we ain' t been to the bronx before .
no sweat .
this conclave' s gonna be a reai big item .
every gang in the city is gonna be there .
we' re going in with nothing .
we' re going in there iike everybody else .
nine guys , no weapons .
you got the stuff ?
i want you to hit everything in sight .
i want everybody to know the warriors were there .
you never know what' s out there .
wearing our colors , we can' t hide .
who wants to hide ?
maybe we' ii get to waste a few heads along the way .
you just soldier and keep your mouth shut .
when we get there , you stick close by , okay ?
don' t worry .
i don' t feei iike getting wrecked .
one thing we might get out of cyrus ' iittle get together ... ... is meeting some strange wool .
i wouldn' t mind iaying something down on the way back .
you got a one track brain , you know that ?
what' s the matter ?
you going faggot ?
what do you know about cyrus ?
magic .
a whole iot of magic .
what do you know about cyrus ?
he' s the one and only .
when you' re president of the biggest gang in the city , you don' t have to take any shit .
fuck him .
i' ii teii you something , i' ii bet nobody' s even gonna be there .
can you count , suckers ? !
i say the future is ours ... ... if you can count !
come on , cyrus , we' re with you !
go ahead , bro !
now , iook what we have here before us .
we' ve got the saracens ... ... sitting next to the jones street boys .
we' ve got the moon runners ... ... right by the van courtland rangers .
nobody is wasting nobody .
that ... ... is a miracle .
and miracles is the way things ought to be .
yeah !
i heard that !
i heard that .
come get answered !
you' re standing right now with nine delegates from 1 00 gangs .
and there' s over 1 00 more .
that' s 20, 000 hard core members .
forty thousand , counting affiliates , and 20, 000 more , not organized but ready to fight .
sixty thousand soldiers .
now , there ain' t but 20, 000 police in the whole town .
can you dig it ?
can you dig it ?
can you dig it ?
yeah !
now here' s the sum total .
one gang could run this city .
one gang .
nothing would move without us ailowing it to happen .
we could tax the crime syndicates , the police , because we got the streets , suckers !
can you dig it ?
right on !
the problem in the past has been the man turning us against one another .
we have been unable to see the truth , because we' ve been fighting for 1 0 square feet of ground , our turf , our iittle piece of turf .
that' s crap , brothers .
the turf is ours by right because it' s our turn .
aii we have to do is keep up the generai truce .
we take over one borough at a time .
secure our territory , secure our turf because it' s aii our turf .
the other way , against the crowd !
and keep your ass down !

if it ain' t , we' re gonna have to bop our way back .
