montreal was stunned by the daring predawn robbery ... of the old city' s historic customshouse .
a priceless scepter was stolen .
a senior night janitor ... identified this man ... as the prime suspect in the burglary .
he was spotted leaving the scene moments after the robbery ... and is now the focus of a massive manhunt .
a second suspect vanished from the scene without a trace .
police have no solid leads .
