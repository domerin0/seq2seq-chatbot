when did you notice he was missing ?
when we picked up our baggage here .
has the boy ever run away from home ?
no .
has he ever been on his own ?
mmm .
as a matter of fact , this has happened before .
it' s becoming sort of a family travel tradition .
funnily enough , we never lose our luggage .
he was left at home by accident last year .
yeah , that' s what my wife meant ... when she said it' s a family travel tradition .
we' il call chicago and , uh ... notify them of the situation .
the odds are that' s where he is .

morning , mr. mccallister .
good morning .
it' s beginning to look a lot
iike christmas
mr. mccallister , here' s your very own ... cheese pizza .
take a look in the five and ten
listening once again
with candy canes and silver lanes aglow
it' s beginning to look a lot like christmas
toys in every store
but the prettiest sight to see
is the holly that will be
hello ?
hello .
know any good toy stores ?
yes , sir !
it' s beginning to look a lot
iike christmas
soon the bells will start
and the thing that will make them ring
is the carol that you sing
right within your heart
bingo !
get out of here !
go on !
get out of here !
beat it !
get out of here !
hey ... marv !
get over here !
i got to talk to you !
whoa !
whoa !
would you like a scarf ?
forget the scarf , marv .
we got to talk .
we don' t have the equipment to pull off anything big you know , your banks , jewelry stores .
we don' t want goods .
we need cash , and we need it now .
how about , uh ... hotels ?
tourists carry lots of cash .
there' s no guarantees .
i got a better idea .
stores don' t deposit cash on christmas eve .
the only stores that' il have cash on hand ... are ones that deal in moderate priced goods .
right ... right .
what stores make lots of cash christmas eve ... that nobody' s going to think to rob ?
candy stores .
nine year olds rob candy stores , marv .
this is what i had in mind .
that' s brilliant , harry .
brilliant !
yep .
there' s nobody dumb enough ... to knock off a toy store on christmas eve .
oh , yes , there is .
here we are , sir ...
duncan' s toy chest .
merry christmas , kevin .
this is the greatest accident of my life .
marv .
marv !
hey , nice house , but there' s no bathroom in it .
what' s the plan ?
everybody leaves for a nice holiday off .
we come out of our little houses ...
yeah , then what ?
we empty the registers and walk out like we own the joint .
great plan , harry !
shake his hand .
well , now thank you and merry christmas .
say hello to the family .
oh , yes .
let me see .
eh ...
you shopping alone ?
in new york ?
sir , i' m afraid of my own shadow .
i was just checking .
that' s very responsible of you .
oh , well , thank you .
my pleasure .
that' il be $23 . 75 .
my , my , my !
where did you get all that money ?
uh ... i have a lot of grandmothers .
oh .
well , that explains it .
this is a really nice store one of the finer toy dealerships i' ve ever visited .
oh , well , thank you .
mr. duncan must be a pretty nice guy ...
ietting all the kids come into his store ... and play with his toys .
most toy stores prohibit that .
oh , is that so ?
yep .
well , he loves kids .
as a matter of fact ... all the money the store takes in today ...
mr. duncan is donating it to the children' s hospital ... and the day after christmas ... we empty all the money in the cash register ... and mr. duncan just takes it right down to the hospital .
that' s very generous of him .
well , children bring him a lot of joy ... as they do to everyone who appreciates them .
i' m not supposed to spend this money ... but i have twenty dollars from shoveling snow ... in a jar in our garage ... where my older brother can' t find it .
so i' il pay my mother back with that .
you can give this to mr. duncan .
the hospital needs it more than i do .
besides , i' il probably spend it on stuff ... that' il rot my teeth and my mind .
aw ... that' s that' s very sweet of you .
eh ... you see that tree there ?
to show our appreciation for your generosity ...
i' m going to let you select an object from that tree ... that you can take home with you .
free ?
oh , yeah .
eh ... may may i make a suggestion ?
ok .
take the turtledoves .
i could have two ?
well , two turtledoves .
i' il tell you what you do .
you keep one ... and you give the other one to a very special person .
you see ... turtledoves are a symbol of friendship and love .
as long as each of you have your turtledove ... you' il be friends forever .
wow !
i never knew that .
i thought they were just part of a song .
they are ... and and for that very special reason .
wow !
thanks .
merry christmas .
merry christmas to you , too .
be sure to bundle up if you go outside .
it' s a little nippy .

put him down .
that ain' t him .
we should' ve shot him when we had the chance .
i hate pulling a job knowing that creep is on the loose .
what can he do ?
kids are helpless .
not this kid .
this time , he doesn' t have a houseful ... of dangerous goodies to get us with .
he' s in the park .
he' s alone .
kids are a scared of the park .
yeah .
grown men come in the park ... and don' t leave alive .
yeah .
good luck , little fella .
i want to go home .
mom , where are you ?
turn that down .
hello .
kate mccallister , please .
this is she .
ma' am , we found your son .
what ?
the police know where kevin is .
he' s in new york city .
he' s in new york .
new york ?
new york ?
he checked into the plaza with your husband' s credit card .
i' m sure he was scared .
he' s not a troublemaker .
would you hold just a second ?
he used your credit card to check into the plaza hotel .
do they still have him ?
do they have him ?
no , police are still looking .
damn it !
we' re on the next flight out .
thank you .
we' re going to new york .
yes !
yes !
he ran away when they questioned him about the card .
he must be so scared .
would he go to my brother' s place ?
aren' t they in paris ?
maybe there' s a housesitter .
i thought you said they' re renovating .
hello !
uncle rob ?
aunt georgette ?
anybody home ?
hello !
anybody home ?
it' s me , your favorite nephew kevin .
uncle rob !
aunt georgette !
watch it , kid !
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !
hey , looking for somebody ... to read you a bedtime story ?
taxi !
boy , it' s scary out there .
ain' t much better in here , kid .
i don' t want to ever take a vacation like this again .
where did all you come from ?
i may not have enough for everybody .
how hungry are you guys ?
well , you guys ate all my food .
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah !
look , i' m sorry i screamed in yourface .
you were just trying to help me , right ?
i' m kevin mccallister .
your birds are real nice .
i' ve seen you before .
you had pigeons all over you .
at first , you looked kind of scary .
but when i think about it , it' s not so bad .
they must be all over you ' cause they like you .
if i' m bothering you , i can leave .
am i bothering you ?
no .
good .
i' m not a pain in the butt ?
no .
will those pigeons come back on their own ... or do you have to call them ?
give me your hand .
they can hear it .
this is great .
it' s pretty cold out .
i could sure go for a cup of hot chocolate .
how about you ?
my treat .
i' d hate to spend christmas eve in central park .
can we go someplace warm ?
yes .
i know a place .
nice music .
this place is great .
i' ve heard the world' s great music from here .
ella fitzgerald , count basie ...
frank sinatra ...
luciano pavarotti .
so , do you bring your friends up here ?
i haven' t got many friends .
oh .
sorry .
i' m like the birds i care for .
people pass me in the street .
they see me , but they try to ignore me .
they' d prefer i wasn' t part of their city .
yeah .
it' s sorta like that with my family .
i' m kinda the pigeon of the house ... just because i' m the youngest .
everyone fights for position .
everybody wants to be seen ... and heard .
i guess so .
i' m seen and heard pretty much ... but then i get sent to my room a lot , too .
i wasn' t always like this , you know .
oh .
what were you like before ?
i had a job ...
i had a home ...
i had a family .
did you have any kids ?
no .
oh , i wanted them ... but the man i loved ... fell out of love with me .
that broke my heart .
and whenever the chance to be loved came along again ...
i ran away from it .
i stopped trusting people .
no offense ... but that seems like sort of a dumb thing to do .
i was afraid of getting my heart broken again .
you see , sometimes you can trust a person ... and then , when things are down ... they forget about you .
maybe they' re just too busy .
maybe they don' t forget about you ... but they forget to remember you .
i don' t think people mean to forget .
i think it just happens .
my grandfather says if my head wasn' t screwed on ...
i' d leave it on the school bus .
i' m just afraid if i do trust someone ...
i' il get my heart broken again .
i understand that .
i used to have a really nice pair of roller blades .
i was afraid i' d wreck them ... so i kept them in the box .
you know what happened ?
no .
i outgrew them .
i never wore them once outside ... just in my room a couple of times .
a person' s heart and a person' s feelings ... are very different than skates .
well , they' re kind of the same thing .
if you aren' t going to use your heart ... then what' s the difference if it gets broken ?
if you just keep it to yourself ... maybe it' il be like my roller blades when you do decide to try it ... it won' t be any good .
you should take a chance .
you got nothing to lose .
a bit of truth in there somewhere .
i think so .
your heart might still be broken ... but it isn' t gone .
if it was gone , you wouldn' t be this nice .
thank you .
do you know that it' s been ... a couple of years since i' ve talked to anybody ?
that' s ok .
you' re really good at it .
you' re not boring .
you don' t mumble or spit when you talk .
you should do it more often .
you just have to wear an outfit ... that doesn' t have pigeon poop on it .
oh , i have been working very hard ... at keeping people away , haven' t l ?
i always think i' il have a lot of fun if i' m alone ... but being alone isn' t much fun .
i don' t care how much people bug me sometimes ...
i' d rather be with somebody than by myself .
so what are you doing running around the streets ... on christmas eve alone ?
did you get into trouble ?
yeah .
you' ve done something wrong ?
a lot of things .
did you know that a good deed erases a bad deed ?
it' s getting pretty late .
i don' t know if i' il have enough time ... to erase all the bad deeds i did .
well , it' s christmas eve .
good deeds count for extra tonight .
they do ?
of course they do .
so you must think of the most important thing ... that you can do for others ... and go and do it .
just follow the star in your own heart .
ok .
it' s getting pretty late .
i better get going .
if i don' t see you again , i hope everything turns out ok .
thank you .
say good bye to your birds for me .
oh , i will .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
if you need somebody to trust , it can be me .
i won' t forget to remember you .
don' t make promises you can' t keep .
distant stars at home up in the heavens
wonder what they see
are they watching me ?
christmas star
you watch the world so wisely
at my journey' s end
will you be my true friend ?
starlight , shine bright
see me through the dark night
light my pathway
guide me home for christmas
all the money in the cash register ...
mr. duncan is going to donate to the children' s hospital .
at midnight tonight , we' re hitting duncan' s toy chest .
you can mess with a lot of things ... but you can' t mess with kids on christmas .
we' d like to offer you ... a complimentary suite while you' re here .
it' s a penthouse with a view of the park .
i think you' il find it satisfactory .
it was recently vacated by the countess of worcestershire .
what kind of hotel allows a child to check in alone ?
the boy had a very convincing story .
what kind of idiots are working here ?
the finest in new york .
when you discovered the credit card was stolen
i made the discovery .
why did you let him leave ?
when we attempted to confront him , he ran .
you scared him away .
it' s christmas eve , and because of you ... our child is lost in one of the biggest cities in the world .
could you take our family and our luggage up to the room ?
yes , sir .
run along , cedric .
i' m going down to the police station ... and make sure they' re trying to find kevin .
i want you to stay with the kids .
no .
i' m going to look for him .
what ?
with all due respect , madam ... your son is lost in one of the biggest cities in the world .
could you stay out of this , please ?
as you wish .
thank you .
i don' t think it' s a good idea ... for you to run around new york city all by yourself .
if our son can do it , i can do it .
peter , i' il be fine .
the way i' m feeling ... no mugger or murderer would dare mess with me .
madam , there are hundreds of parasites ... armed to the teeth
do bundle up .
it' s awfully cold outside .
marv , marv , come on .
let' s go .
marv ... crowbars up .
merry christmas , harry .
happy hanukkah , marv .
this is more money than i can even count .
makes you wonder why we spent so much time ... robbing private homes .
ha ha !
the amazing thing is , we' re fugitives from the law ... we' re up to our elbows in cash ... and nobody even knows about it .
he' s back !
he took our picture !
how did my hair look ?
this is it .
no turning back .
another christmas in the trenches .

this ain' t like the last time .
this ain' t his house .
the kid' s running scared .
he ain' t got a plan .
may i do the thinking , please ?
thank you .
sonny !
yes ?
nothing would thrill me more greatly ... than to shoot you .
knocking off a youngster ... ain' t going to mean all that much to me , understand ?
mm hmm .
but since we' re in a hurry , i' il make a deal with you .
you throw down your camera ... and we won' t hurt you .
you' il never hear from us again .
ok ?
you promise ?
i cross my heart and hope to die .
ok .

mr. duncan , it' s all over .
we apprehended the thieves , and we recovered your money .
good .
i want to get that money ... over to the children' s hospital .
i' il handle it personally .
thank you very much .
excuse me , mr. duncan .
i found this note .
looks like a kid broke your window .
turtledoves .
ohh .
oh , excuse me .
i' m looking for my son .
he' s this boy right here .
excuse me .
please help me .
this boy right here , have you seen him ?
this one .
please ?
i' m looking for my son .
he' s been missing for two days .
have you filed a report ?
yes , of course we have .
then trust us .
we' il handle it .
oh .
but i' m his mother .
i realize that , ma' am ... but you' re looking for a needle in a haystack .
do you have kids ?
yes , ma' am .
and what would you do if one of them was missing ?
i' d probably be doing the same thing you' re doing .
thank you .
look , put yourself in your kid' s shoes .
where would you go ?
what would you do ?
me ?
i' d probably be lying dead in a gutter somewhere .
oh , but not kevin .
no .
kevin is so much stronger and braver than i am .
i know kevin' s fine .
i' m sure he is .
fine .
but he' s still all by himself in a big city ... and he doesn' t deserve that .
he deserves to be at home with his own family ... around his christmas tree .
oh , dear god .
i know where he is .
i need to get to rockefeller center .
hop in .
thank you .
i know i don' t deserve a christmas ... even if i did do a good deed .
i don' t want any presents .
instead , i want to take back ... every mean thing i ever said to my family .... even if they don' t take back the things they said .
i don' t care .
i' il love all of them ... including buzz .
if i can only see one , can i see my mother ?
i' il never want another thing as long as i live .
i just want my mother .
i know i won' t see her tonight ... but promise me i can see her again ... sometime , anytime .
even if it' s just once and only for a couple of minutes .
i just need to tell her i' m sorry .
kevin ?
mom ?
wow .
that worked fast .
oh , kevin .
mom , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , too .
merry christmas , mom .
merry christmas , sweetheart .
thank you .
let' s go .
how' d you know i was here ?
i know you and christmas trees ... and this is the biggest around .
where' s everybody else ?
they' re at the hotel .
they didn' t like the palm trees , either .
holy smokes !
it' s morning !
it' s christmas morning , man .
fuller , don' t get your hopes up .
huh ?
i don' t think santa claus visits hotels .
are you nuts ?
he' s omnipresent .
he goes everywhere .
hey , guys , wake up !
it' s christmas !
mom , dad , it' s christmas !
what ? !
what on earth ?
come on .
i wanna find out .
oh , wow .
where did it all come from ?
mom !
dad !
you got to see this !
gosh .
peter !
are you sure we' re in the right room ?
look at all this stuff !
yeah !
oh , wow !
look !
don' t open any of mine .
i mean it .
who' s mr. duncan ?
duncan ?
i don' t know .
all right .
everyone just calm down .
calm down .
hey , hey !
all right .
now ... if kevin hadn' t screwed up in the first place again ... then we wouldn' t be in this most perfect and huge hotel room ... with a truckload of all this free stuff ... so ...
i think it only fair ... that kevin get to open up the first present .
then i' il go ... and the rest of you , and so on .
merry christmas , kev .
merry christmas , buzz .
merry christmas , kevin .
ok , kevin !
all right !
merry christmas !
enough of this gooey sh show ... of emotion .
everyone , let' s dig in !

give me the bows .
merry christmas .
kevin !
merry christmas !
i got something for you .
what' s this ?
it' s a turtledove .
i have one , you have one .
as long as we each have a turtledove ... we' il be friends forever .
oh , kevin .
thank you .
i won' t forget you .
trust me .
oh .
