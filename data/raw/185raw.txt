it' s getting late .
come on home .
timmy .
maureen , look .

what the hell ?
we' re throwing a party , ain' t we ?
but these are the same slices as usual .
yeah , sure .
as usual .
maureen .

you' il have beautiful new clothes and you won' t have to work no more .
we' re going to get rich , pa ?
who knows ?
patrick !
wait a minute !
look at the filth on your boots .
clean ' em .
the train' il come in and there won' t be no one to meet your mother .
our mother died six years ago .
go now , or you' il really be late .
just a minute .
listen , pa .
how will i recognise her ?
you can' t make no mistake , patrick .
she' s young and she' s pretty and she' s a lady .
for travelling , i' il be wearing a black dress and the same straw hat that i was wearing when we met .
i' m gonna get some fresh water from the well .
oh , danny boy
the pipes , the pipes are calling
and down the mountain side
the summer' s gone
and all the roses fall ...
maureen !
what are we gonna do with this one , frank ?
now that you' ve called me by name ...
i saw some fine stock down south .
that so ?
and the prices are good .
these your valises , ma' am ?
yes .
come , sarah .
bring them other two .
we' il tote ' em for you , ma' am .
is that true ?
the sawmill needs hands ?
was yesterday .
why didn' t you tell your brother ?
hiya , gramps .
hiya , bill .
we' re back again .
come on .
get a move on , will you ?
get the lead out of your asses , you redskin warriors .
i got a whole train to unload .
alright , chuck down those feed sacks first .
come on !
what' s the name of the place you wanted to go ?
sweetwater .
brett mcbain' s farm .
mcbain ?
yeah , sure .
that stubborn redheaded lrishman , tilling sand for years out in the middle of nowhere .
sweetwater !
only a loony like him could call that stinking piece of desert sweetwater .
sweetwater !
a little more to the right .
higher .
hold it there .
here they are .
even got here with their damn rails .
they caught up with us again , eh , lafayette ?
let' s go !
slow down .
what' s the matter with you ?
watch out down there !
slow down !
why are we stopping ?
i told you i was in a hurry .
don' t the train stop ?
what can i do for you , ma' am ?
i would like some water , if it' s no trouble .
water ?
that word is poison around these parts ever since the days of the great flood .
you mean you never wash ?
we sure do !
i' d like to use the same facilities you people do .
you sure can .
just happen to have a full tub at the back .
you' re lucky .
only three people have used it this morning .
used it one at a time or all together ?
i can tell you' re accustomed to fine living .
bet you come from one of those big eastern cities .
new orleans .
new orleans !
you' ve been there ?
no .
but i got a cousin down there .
she runs a bar .
you know , she ...
jug .
do you only know how to play or do you know how to shoot ?
do you know how to blow music from that ?
pick it up .
you !
you don' t know how to play .
try this one .
take it .
go on .
here .
bravo .
cheyenne .
we thought we' d never make it .
it' s alright .
you' re right on time .
to bury my escort .
if i' d waited for you , i' d be in jail by now .
the gun .
you interested in fashions , harmonica ?
i saw three of these dusters a short time ago .
they were waiting for a train .
inside the dusters , there were three men .
so ?
inside the men , there were three bullets .
that' s a crazy story , harmonica .
for two reasons .
one , nobody around these parts got the guts to wear those dusters except cheyenne' s , man .
two , cheyenne' s , man , don' t get killed .
that surprise you ?
yeah .
well , you know music .
and you can count .
all the way up to two .
all the way up to six , if i have to .
and maybe faster than you .
yeah , go on .
play , harmonica .
play , so you can' t bullshit .
only , watch those false notes .
like so ?
this cousin of mine keeps writing me to come down to new orleans .
come on down .
help me with the bar .
make a pile of money .
i don' t think i' d get along in a big city .
it' s too full of fast men and loose women .
begging your pardon , ma' am .
no .
now , i' m too used to a quiet simple country life .
he' s timmy .
yes .
dear god .
on the day ...
on the very day of your wedding .
poor little miss .
mrs.
mrs mcbain .
but we all ...
we thought ...
i know .
it was to be a surprise today .
brett mcbain and i were married .
a month ago .
in new orleans .
i am the resurrection and the life .
he who believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live .
whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die .
amen .
mr bennett !
what' s he doing here ?
i found this collar on a nail by the door .
you got no way of knowing , but this is as good as a signature .
cheyenne' s hand .
but why ?
don' t worry , mrs mcbain .
we' il make ' em tell us before we hang ' em .
let' s get moving .
come on .
let' s go back to flagstone .
no , sam .
you go back .
you don' t want to stay out here alone .
why not ?
this is my home .
you know , wobbles , ... .. i' m kinda mad at you .
frank wasn' t there .
he sent three friends .
i don' t know nothing , i swear .
i only arranged the meeting the way you wanted it .
i don' t know why frank wasn' t there .
i swear to you that i ...
cos he was at the mcbains ' .
that' s not true .
cheyenne did that job .
everyone knows that .
we got proof .
that was always one of frank' s tricks .
faking evidence .
i don' t know .
i swear .
i only arranged the meeting .
i swear .
i don' t know nothing .
who' s there ?
did you make coffee ?
make it .
didn' t sleep a wink .
a pack of turds dressed in black rode herd on me the whole damn night .
yeah , but i left them in the middle of the desert .
if they' re lucky , they' il be home in three days .
i' il do it .
you fetch the coffee .
they want to hang me , the big black crows .
idiots .
what the hell ?
i' il kill anything , but never a kid .
be like killing a priest .
a catholic priest , that is .
yeah , the world is full of people who hate cheyenne .
see , i ain' t the mean bastard people make out .
of course , if somebody had a mind to kill me , ... .. it fires me up .
and a fired up cheyenne ... .. ain' t a nice thing to see .
especially for a lady .
but you' re too smart to make him mad .
so this here' s where i was supposed to do all the killing ?
yeah .
don' t seem the place is worth a shit .
now , if somebody gets dressed up to look like me , ...
.. so they can hang this thing around my neck , ... .. i don' t like it none .
but i can understand it .
what i don' t understand is why .
neither do l .
but i see you looked a lot for the why .
yeah .
what if there were a whole heap of whys ?
round .
yellow .
you know the kind .
you rap ' em on a stone , ... .. and they go " ding " .
maybe .
but i didn' t find them .
by the way , you know anything about a man going around playing a harmonica ?
he' s somebody you' d remember .
instead of talking , he plays .
and when he' d better play , he talks .
you know , when you' ve killed four , it' s easy to make it five .
sure .
you' re an expert .
ma' am , it seems to me you ain' t caught the idea .
of course i have .
i' m here alone in the hands of a bandit who smelled money .
if you want to , you can lay me over the table and amuse yourself .
and even call in your men .
well , no woman ever died from that .
when you' re finished , all i' il need will be a tub of boiling water , and i' il be exactly what i was before .
with just another filthy memory .
you make good coffee , at least .
not bad .
congratulations .
tell me , was it necessary that you kill all of them ?
i only told you to scare them .
people scare better when they' re dying .
and can you tell me what good was your stupid massacre ?
now , a mrs mcbain has turned up .
so , i didn' t expect that .
it happens in business .
let' s say this is something i didn' t plan on .
i have no time for surprises , frank .
you know that .
i got on board in sight of the atlantic , and before my eyes rot ,
i want to see the blue of the pacific outside that window .
i know where you got on board .
i was there , too , remember .
to remove small obstacles from the track , you said .
well , there were a few .
but we travelled a long way , just the same .
and fast .
even tuberculosis of the bones travels fast .
don' t play the sick man with me , mr morton .
i knew you when you were just barely limping .
i watch that dry rot rise a little more every day .
any normal man' d put a bullet in his brain .
but you , you just got a little more hasty .
otherwise you ain' t changed any .
i' d say you' ve changed , frank .
a lot .
you used to take care of certain things personally .
now , you' re keeping in the background .
you' il end up giving orders .
it' s because , now , i don' t want to leave you alone too much .
you' re gonna need somebody more and more every day to stay near you .
like a friend .
or like a partner .
how does it feel sitting behind that desk , frank ?
it' s almost like holding a gun .
only much more powerful .
you see , staying with you , i ... .. i' m beginning to think big , too .
this mcbain business ... .. has given me ideas .
i' m sorry for you , frank .
you' re doing your best .
you' il never succeed in becoming like me .
why ?
because there are many things you' il never understand .
this is one of them .
you see , frank , there are many kinds of weapons .
and the only one that can stop that is this .
now , shall we get back to our little problem ?
my weapons might look simple to you , mr morton , but they can still shoot holes big enough for our little problems .
pretty soon the widow mcbain won' t be a problem no more .
you wake up one morning and say , " world , i know you .
from now on , there are no more surprises .
and then you happen to meet a man like this , who looked like a good man .
clear eyes , strong hands .
and he wants to marry you .
which doesn' t happen often .
and he says he' s rich , too , which doesn' t hurt .
so you think , " the hell with new orleans .
now i' il say yes and go live in the country .
i wouldn' t mind giving him half a dozen kids after all .
take care of a house .
do something .
what the hell ?
well , god rest your soul , brett mcbain .
even if he' s going to have a job pulling you out of the devil' s grip .
still , i swear he' d left money around someplace .
if you can find it , you' re welcome to it .
mrs mcbain goes back to civilisation .
minus a husband and plus a great future .
you deserve better .
the last man who told me that is buried out there .
you know , jill , you remind me of my mother .
she was the biggest whore in alameida and the finest woman that ever lived .
whoever my father was , for an hour or for a month , ... .. he must have been a happy man .
what do you want ?
cheyenne' s right .
once you' ve killed four , it' s easy to make it five .
this isn' t the time to leave .
give me some water .
from the well .
i like my water fresh .
when you hear a strange sound , drop to the ground .
a sound ?
like what ?
like that .
he not only plays , he can shoot , too .
morning , mrs mcbain .
what brings you to town ?
good morning .
maybe you don' t remember , but yesterday at the funeral ...
i remember very well .
is there something i can do for you ?
yes .
see frank .
and tell him i know everything .
why is everybody hounding me about this guy frank ?
i don' t know him .
i' ve never heard of him .
i got my own worries , and all i want is to be left in peace .
tell frank i want to negotiate with him .
personally .
you were told not to come here for any reason .
whatever business you have with frank , keep it far away from here .
i know , but when i heard that woman say she knew everything ,
i thought i should come over here and tell you about it .
you never thought it wasn' t a trick ?
sure , but you know i' m mighty careful .
no one could have followed me .
that' s the first thing i learned , working for you .
to listen unseen and to watch unheard .
you should learn to live as if you didn' t exist .
you' ve known me a long time , frank .
you know you can trust me .
wobbles .
how can you trust a man who wears both a belt and suspenders ?
the man can' t even trust his own pants .
let' s get out of here .
the end of the line .
yeah .
get him on board .
tie him up .
wait , frank .
i didn' t ...
so , nobody followed you ?
no .
you gotta believe me .
so , this is the way i can trust you .
i can explain .
i didn' t know that he ...
get out .
no , frank .
get out .
frank , wait !
i told you to keep quiet .
did logan and jim take care of the woman ?
someone took care of them .
we found them out at mcbain' s place .
stone dead .
and the woman was gone .
your friends have a high mortality rate , frank .
first three , then two .
so you' re the one who makes appointments .
and you' re the one who doesn' t keep ' em .
what do you want ?
who are you ?
dave jenkins .
dave jenkins is dead a long time ago .
calder benson .
what' s your name ?
benson' s dead , too .
you ought to know better than anyone .
you killed ' em .
who are you ?
who are you , you ...
frank !
