a nightmare .

what you doing ?
nothing .
i can' t sleep .
that gang again ?
for 8 months , they' re all i' ve thought about .
i know !
8 months , i need to talk to you .
they just slip between our fingers .
did you hear me ?
sure .
i need to talk too .
they dress up as santa claus !
you don' t believe in him ?
they' re going to surprise us .
and i' m going to surprise you .
i have to nail them before xmas .
we need to talk before xmas .
ok , that' s a deal .
what you doing ?
going to work .
it' s 3 am !
it is ?
good , less traffic .
no xmas shoppers .
no kidding .
better that way .
see you at the office .
i' d like an appointment !
lily !
you' re awake ?
it' s 4 a. m and you' re doing repairs .
not repairs .
it' s winter .
i' m adjusting her for when it' s cold .
better install a radiator in my bed , so i don' t get cold either alone in my bed .
but me , it' s all year round .
don' t say that .
hands off !
or i' il need the scrub thingy .
what scrub thingy ?
that cleans pot and pans and , sometimes , numbskulls like me .
i' il be right up .
i don' t think so .
after you wash , you stink of turpentine .
and then it' s time to get up for work .
you' re on top form !
i got in 2 hours ago .
you were asleep so i came down here rather than watch tv .
daniel !
we have no tv !
it' s the principle .
no tv !
no music !
no curtains !
no couch !
no vases !
but , hey , you don' t send me flowers !
we have a fridge !
full of lamps but it' s a fridge !
the shower stinks of gas the laundry of car wax and the closet' s so full of tires
finally , we have every couple' s ultimate luxury ...
a garage !
you got your period ?
just the opposite !
i' m just sick of living in a garage .
a woman isn' t a barbie with soft skin .
a woman moves , evolves and occasionally , likes a bit of comfort !
all because i' m working on the car !
women !
what' s the deal with turps ?
lily , what are you doing ?
going home .
you prefer a boot camp ?
with curtains , a garden and flowers !
it' s stupid ! we can' t ...
you liked living here .
now i don' t but you won' t listen .
you live for your car !
it' s too small for both of us .
it' s her or me !
take your pick !
hi , honeys , taking the kids out ?
it' s humor !
a joke !
fun in the workplace , see ?
merry christmas to you !
what you doing here ?
you spend the night ?
i was just taking 5 .
the file is printed to your face .
if it' s like the rings on a tree
it looks as if you been asleep maybe ...
20 years !
ok , forget i spoke .
nobody has a sense of humor .
i thought the police had fun .
fun off , will you !
i got some great moroccan !
dirt cheap .
want a little ?
from the high plateaus .
hold on , we' re not into that .
you' re missing out .
a little coke ?
rachid !
have a nice day !
what the hell was that ?
and who' s this ?
that' s bob marley .
this isn' t some kind of squat !
what about the gang ?
the santa claus gang ?
ring any bells ?
37 jobs in 8 months and no leads !
i go over and over it .
nothing !
i feel empty , stupid , useless ...
sure you won' t have
a rachid pick me up ?
no !
just trying to help .
how about ... breakfast ?
get your strength up .
ok , breakfast then .
jeez !
someone' s hungry .
i don' t eat .
my mind' s on the gang !
nightmares !
tied up by dancing santa clauses .
it' s horrible !
stop , please
your lace is undone .
it' s xmas .
santa clauses everywhere .
in july , we' d easily spot them .
except , in july , we didn' t spot them .
they must be planning a huge job !
one thing' s bugging me .
why do they dress up as santa claus ?
who' d suspect santa of anything ?
he looks so sweet with his red costume often too big for him .
or too small .
it' s an ideal disguise for concealing ...
a gun !
if sir' s looking for the perfect blender fruit , veg , purees
if sir has children ...
everybody get down !
police !
you' re under arrest !
what happened ?
i got him !
after 8 months !
how d' you know he' s with the gang ?
does santa often carry a gun on him ?
how did you know ?
the jerk dropped it .
no kidding , he' s a jerk !
the chief will love him .
hey , chief , we got one of the he' s never in .
sit down and don' t move , ok ?
while we' re waiting , i' m chief .
suit the desk , huh ?
cut it out !
he' s not here !
anyhow , promotion' s coming my way now .
ok , daddy claus how d' you get a police gun ?
who d' you steal it from ?
alain , he needs an address .
marseille region ?
if you need help , we have the yellow pages .
so what about the gun ?
you realize we just look on the computer and we find the fool who got his gun stolen .
shit !
he stole gibert' s gun !
no !
i swear !
you know this is our chief' s gun ?
maybe you' d like to explain ?
alain !
maybe he' d answer without the tape ?
you could be right .
emilien !
chief !
somebody needs me .
why the disguise , chief ?
i' m doing my job !
i dressed up to infiltrate the gang and you screwed it up !
i' m sorry , but why not let us in on it ?
it wasn' t an invasion .
it was infiltration .
alone !
don' t worry , i' il see you get the chance to dress up and direct traffic !
get these cuffs off me .
sure , chief .
shit , they' re alain' s cuffs .
hurry up , emilien .
5 minutes !
you' re captain gibert ?
not yet .
i mean , i' m not captain yet .
i' m not gibert either .
i mean i' d hate to be gibert be right back , chief !
you are captain gibert ?
that' s me .
what can i do for you ?
my name is qiu .
that' s cute , qiu very cute .
you are ...
i could get to like you ...
like ...
you' re chinese ?
yes .
from my mother .
swiss from my dad .
great , i love the swiss .
i work for the magazine
world lnternational , writing a piece on french police .
i asked to follow a major detective and you are the biggest
true enough i mean , 6' 3 " is fairly big
for a cop , it' s rare .
that' s impressive !
sometimes , looking the mirror , i impress myself too
could i stick close for a few days ?
as long as you like , i mean ...
as long as your piece takes .
y' know , i get close to my piece too .
thanks .
can we start ?
with pleasure .
thank you , qiu .
it' s ok .
why are you dressed as santa right here in your office ?
this is my camouflage gear .
it' s to infiltrate the santa claus gang .
we need to get inside their minds and bodies .
the cuffs ?
they' re not mine !
any other questions ?
enter !
bad time ?
no , it can' t get any worse .
as you' re not doing anything , i' d like to talk .
no time now , we' il talk at home .
at home , your mind' s on work .
so i thought i' d better catch you at work .
not today , petra , ok ?
for 8 months , you' ve said that .
i' m in the shit !
don' t push me under , will you !
what' s happened now ?
i saw a santa claus .
with a gun !
i thought of the gang .
with or without a gun , it' s all you think about .
this was santa with a gun !
so i neutralized him .
all by yourself ?
not the gang , then ?
not even !
gibert in disguise !
you can laugh .
i could have died .
you should console me .
console you ?
i don' t know , say something sweet , give me some good news .
i' m pregnant .
that' s good news , isn' t it ?
sure ...
but ...
since when ?
since 8 months ago .
how did that happen ?
the holy spirit came down .
8 months ago ?
i' d have noticed .
your breasts are all ...
so that' s why they' re ...
are you going to keep it ?
it' s a bit late now , huh ?
sure .
why didn' t you say ?
i tried to tell you .
i put cauliflowers all over .
look i wondered about that .
and photos from the scan .
they' re everywhere !
that' s my baby ?
mine .
if you want in , buck up .
is it normal ?
knowing the dad , you might wonder .
but , oddly enough , it' s normal .
so , if you' re pregnant and it' s normal and you' re keeping it i' m going to be a daddy .
very good .
they could use you in the police .
you' d go far !
me , a daddy ?
yes , and this kid will need a great daddy .
you can count on me , petra .
lily !
you' re not laughing now .
what use is a car without the woman you love ?
rapid test ?
what' s a rapid test ?
2 lines ?
what' s that mean ?
hi !
hi !
do you have the box that comes in ?
let' s see .
isn' t it some kind of pregnancy test ?
precisely !
can we hurry ?
don' t move .
it' s next to the condoms .
i' m out of stock .
we had a rush on them .
women like to give a little baby for xmas .
that' s what i' m thinking .
i understand .
i' il ask my daughter .
angele !
she helps out . she knows it all by heart .
it' s impressive .
angele , what' s this ?
sorry , i try to be careful but i was drunk .
i told you to help yourself to condoms .
there were none his size !
whose ?
i dunno .
you don' t know his name ?
i was drunk .
i forgot their names .
merry christmas !
this is serious .
the santa claus gang defies us .
i tried a solo commando mission only to be thwarted by emilien .
never mind .
the future is ours .
we' il do with it what we will do .
tomorrow !
starting today !
you can quote me .
it' s clumsy but effective .
your lace is undone .
wonderful .
lndeed .
where was l ?
this is serious .
i won' t accept excessive haste or badly digested process .
don' t quote me .
we must be perfect irreproachable ...
extra clean !
last summer i worked with the nypd .
i picked up some jargon .
isn' t that wild ?
so , hear this , men !
i want the santa claus gang behind bars before christmas .
so , no days off , medical certificates or letters from your parents .
on top of that , ms. qiu a journalist with world lnternational , will accompany us .
let' s give her a good image of our police force .
the key words on this mission
consult !
plan !
act !
i have named this operation snow white .
blanche neige in french .
guess who are the dwarves .
wonderful .
from now on , everybody' s on deck 24/ 7 !
questions ?
me !
what' s the gift ?
what gift ?
sweet .
is it my birthday ?
what month ?
july .
it' s for xmas then .
never mind .
i haven' t got that one .
who' s it from ?
they know your hobbies .
there' s a little button on the top .
put your guns down !
wonderful !
hi , lawmen !
this is santa !
if you believe in me get your gifts outside europa bank at noon
time anybody ?
1 1 : 55 , chief .
red alert !
how can you work with these idiots ?
don' t quote me , ms. qiu .
it' s very french .
we' re always complaining .
spread out and wait .
i mean , let' s go .
last time , they sped away .
now , we' il surprise them .
they told us to be here !
they sent the message thinking we' d think it was a hoax unaware that gibert doesn' t fall on deaf traps .
he' s here !
present and ready to rumble !
imagine the trap was to lure you here .
think , emilien .
it makes no sense .
a criminal who warns the police ?
that' s stupid !
that' s what worries me .
they' re not stupid !
there' s a first time for everything .
unless unless what ?
they' re sure to escape .
let them try .
they won' t go 1 0 meters .
trust me !
captin !
what' s up ?
they' il have to drive over us .
what the heck is that ?
it' s horrible !
you ok , chief ?
i' m just dandy .
why are you still here ?
how do we stop that ?
i don' t know ...
use your imagination !
requisition a car !
why didn' t he stop ?
black and a cop ?
no chance !
even so , he could' ve slowed down .
i' m fine .
i' m used to it .
let' s requisition our cars !
right .
to the cars !
the anti theft system is totally unique based on the atlas system used by the police .
press here and it alerts the nearest police unit .
very efficient .
holy fuck !
my car !
i' il get out .
less weight .
your 50 pounds won' t make much difference .
as for you the old port of marseille and its famous canebiere from " canabe " , the hemp they used for the ropes .
it was king louis xlv in 1 661 who ...
watch out !
you have to keep up !
i am !
the canebiere founded in 1 661 ...
not keep up with me , knucklehead !
with the off roader !
d' you see , qiu ?
we can' t get the staff .
they recruit any old how .
this lad would make a good lifeguard .
but here he is leading a chase without a license .
he doesn' t have a license ?
i only started yesterday .
no way !
calm !
he just has to follow the car ahead .
any lifeguard can handle that .
what now ?
just follow , kid .
that thing guzzles so much gas , he' il run out before us .
in 5 ' , he' s ours !
we won' t last 5 ' .
we will ...
shouldn' t we stop to say sorry ?
all in good time .
first , the chase !
seek and destroy !
funny one .
should i stop ?
what for ?
the pool !
good thinking .
gee , that was close .
hey !
take it easy !
nowhere near 5 ' !
see that ?
perfect seal .
no leaks .
is it always like this ?
most times we get cars that leak !
i can' t swim .
we have a lifeguard .
daniel !
good to see you .
you look terrible .
you see too much of lily .
just joking ...
have fun while you' re young .
seen my driver ?
he' s late .
one block up .
he won' t be long .
perfect !
is lily in ?
of course .
sorry .
didn' t see you there .
don' t worry , i' m used to it .
look who it is !
can we talk a minute ?
i' m going out .
to the doctor' s .
give me a ride , dad ?
of course .
where' s my car ?
he did seem in difficulty .
can i give you both a ride ?
affirmative !
teach him to be late !
c' mon , all aboard !
boulevard cassini , driver !
yes , ma' am .
you' re late , son .
daniel offered us a ride .
see you at barracks .
taking it easy ?
you think ?
the roads are wild and full of potholes , terrible and a little calm does you good .
indeed but i don' t want to be late .
what' s wrong ?
it hurts !
where does it hurt ?
my belly .
that' s awful !
what do we do , general ?
how do i know ?
are you really in pain ?
i' m better now .
it' s gone .
sure ?
yes , it' s gone ...
it' s gone ..
you never used to be so emotional .
it' s xmas , the gifts , all that ...
it gets to me .
yes , so i see .
what' s that behind your ear ?
nothing !
a kind of thermometer .
it takes your blood pressure .
1 line , you' re ok .
2 lines , you' re not ok .
that' s why i' m taking it easy .
thanks for the ride most agreeable .
see you tonight , honey .
i' il ask the doctor but i' d say you' ve no hope .
i hate to intrude but i' m going to be late .
lift off !
enter .
are you ok ?
couldn' t be better .
we' re betrayed by our own equipment .
how can we work ?
don' t forget that .
we need funds .
i want solid chairs , higher doors because
and life buoys in every car .
remember ?
glug glug ...
you see !
not to mention comfortable shoes .
these ones are killing me !
but they' re brand new .
what prankster did that ?
it' s not funny .
the other one' s the same .
it' s not funny at all .
sometimes , it' s just too much .
relax , captain .
you' re too tense .
it' s that gang .
the santa claus gang !
forget about them and let me take care of you .
you know how that works ?
a little .
we got them last week .
i hid my typewriter so they couldn' t take it away .
let yourself go , captain .
in 5 minutes you' il be thinking clearly .
you think so ?
i' m sure of it .
i can' t see .
is that normal ?
perfectly normal .
relax .
that feels good .
it' s all draining away .
that' s exactly it .
you' il see .
y' know , i' m scared i' il nod off .
i' il wake you .
excellent !
you know where you are ?
no , where ?
police hq !
no way !
looks like a garage .
comedian , huh ?
morning , general .
at ease .
thanks , daniel .
see you tonight .
my savior !
can you drop me off ?
i' il give you a ride .
am i glad to see you !
' scuse me ...
can i go ?
i suppose so .
can you keep an eye on the space ?
i' il be back .
easy , i' m not late .
yes , boss .
you' il never guess .
neither will you .
take a guess .
it' s unbelievable .
you got promotion ?
no , it' s personal .
marriage ?
i' m going to be a daddy !
i don' t believe it .
you' d better .
it' s wonderful !
lily' s pregnant too .
no way !
that' s wonderful .
we' il be daddies together .

friends for so long and now having a kid together .
i mean , each having a kid at the same time .
separately yeah , separately , sure .
how many months ?
8 !
you didn' t say !
i didn' t know .
you' re first to know .
ahead of my mom .
and you ?
how many months ?
2 lines .
2 lines ?
it' s a thing you pee on to see how pregnant you are .
she' s 2 lines pregnant .
wow , that' s cool .
yeah , it' s cool .
captain ...
visitors .
what' s this ?
good to see you all .
we were just ...
my colleague here from china has great relaxation technique .
5 hours ' sleep in 5 minutes .
no kidding , it energizes .
the lesson is over .
see you later , captain .
thank you , qiu .
what can i do for you ?
there were all these cauliflowers .
i didn' t even notice .
how dumb can you be ?
that dumb .
but why cauliflowers ?
how do i know ?
it should have given me a hint .
nada !
i am such a klutz .
that' s going too far .
if you were , she' d bail .
you think ?
petra' s anything but a masochist .
that' s good to hear .
yeah but we' re still in shit .
whaddya mean ?
you' re always chasing thieves and i' m a car freak .
we drive them crazy .
and a kid takes up a lot of space .
we have to change our ways .
right !
see him walk take him to school
that' s not just yet .
it' s fingers in sockets first .
outlet plugs !
sure jeez , you don' t think how much work it is .
shit !
good stuff .
rachid give it to you ?
you know rachid ?
a little .
hey , the sun' s coming up .
say , daniel ...
santa on a scooter is that normal ?
usually he' s on a sleigh .
discreet but edgy that' s not normal .
you just said we had to work less to look after our women and future progeny no chase , ok ?
follow him .
at your service !
got anything on scooter 75 bn 1 3 ?
i' il hold .
stolen 2 weeks ago .
perseverance always pays .
petra' il be pleased .
we locate their hideout and i pass it on .
where would i be without you ?
even deeper in it .
we' il lose him .
our only lead and i lose him !
every problem has a solution .
what the hell ?
what are you doing ?
got a better way to tail a scooter ?
no .
maybe it' s a bit conspicuous .
act cool , we' il be fine .
cool , ok
you saw where he went .
now call your chief .
i messed up once .
not again .
i have to check my sources .
santa on a stolen scooter in a warehouse ?
what more d' you want ?
i can' t screw up .
it' il take 5 minutes .
proof ?
or d' you wanna see their guns work ?
no , that' s fine .
best find out how many there are .
come with me .
don' t you know when to stop ?
you said you' d call in .
he' il want to know how many .
and is this their hq or a drop ?
it' il take 5 minutes .
i don' t see this working .
i saw it in a movie .
it' s mind over matter .
i know .
that' s why i' m worried .
if i' m hurt , call gibert .
your lace ...
hello !
i saw the doc .
wanna hear ?
if he' s good , sure .
he' s excellent .
recommended by marie sophie who had 4 kids in 4 years .
that' il be hard to beat .
living apart , yeah .
lily , i' m trying but you have to be there to see it .
can you speak up ?
the santas have got emilien .
looks like they' re about to
lily , lily
aw , shit !
what are you doing here ?
guess .
i' ve been trained to resist torture .
i' il never talk .
we don' t need you to .
we know everything .
anyhow , torture' s outdated .
we' ve more effective ways of getting a man to talk .
really ?
the gentle touch , for example .
that' s the most fearsome of weapons .
what' s a hunk like you doing in the police ?
my job .
hey , that' s off limits .
you do seem open to a little persuasion .
that' s my cell phone .
let' s take a look .
a superb model .
it' s off .
can i turn it on ?
you have no right !
i' m out of units !
it' s human rights abuse !
this is inhumane .
the end justifies the means !
i mean to justify your end .
can' t take your call , i' m busy .
give your ld , we' il be in touch .
you must be on a mission .
i' m very proud of you and your devotion to your work .
you put everything into it .
think of yourself a little .
relax and enjoy life' s pleasures .
and maybe make some time for me too .
call me when it' s over .
big kisses !
you again ?
have you seen emilien ?
he' s been kidnapped !
what on earth for ?
by a group of armed santa clauses .
it' s the santa claus gang !
you don' t say .
he went in alone ?
not quite .
i have an infallible plan to get them .
he will be avenged .
to the cars !
can you stick close by ?
i' ve a sinking feeling about this .
find the santas and we find emilien .
but in what state ?
that' s cheery .
captin !
what good timing !
we' re going to catch the santas in the act !
in the sack with them !
can i come ?
it' s way too dangerous .
it won' t be a christmas carol .
captain ...
please !
ok , it' s not far .
follow us , huh ?
into position .
so , this is xmas .
i' il turn on their lights no messing .
how did you find them ?
my private grapevine .
my brother is in sanitation .
he flunked his police exams .
he cribbed off me but inverted the questions so he got zero .
that happened to all my pals too .
nobody asked you .
anyway , he called me about work in the sewers .
discreetly , i probe and find ...
a tunnel !
between bank and store .
so they can spend the cash right away .
they rob the bank on sunday and walk out via the store .
i get it .
as santas , nobody notices .
the santa disguise was to help them rob the richest bank in marseille .
of course !
you' re a genius !
no , talent and brain power are nothing without training .
can i make a call ?
go ahead .
that' s funny .
emilien has the same .
hello !
it melts in the ear .
activate plan b.
i got it !
ok .
what a beautiful tongue ...
chinese !
chief !
movement inside .
ready !
see the 4 wheel monster and destroy !
i hear you .
xmas is over !
gibert means business .
what the heck ?
where' s the big monster ?
well then ?
catch them !
alive even !
requisitioned !
alain , follow me !
we have a wonderful view over the port .
it' s quiet in winter ?
very .
stop !
chief , wait for me !
in the name of the law !
like i said , minister we need more funding .
yes , 1 bike for 2 officers is not good .
not good at all .
tell the chopper we' re on schedule .
i' il miss you , sweet little emilien .
but you won' t suffer .
great .
you' il have the privilege of knowing when you' il die thanks to modern technology .
that' s my swiss side .
when the mechanism triggers the ball will swing down on its cable with you in the front row .
how long before it triggers ?
you have exactly 5 minutes .
shit !
make the most of it to purify your soul .
you must cleanse your mind and review your life before meeting the eternal .
5 ' to cleanse my mind ?
you have to prioritize .
i took your cell phone as a souvenir .
i' m very sentimental .
that' s my chinese side .
cleanse my mind ?
sure .
what we need is a miracle .
even a tiny one .
not the ball !
not the taxi !
you' ve no idea what happened .
it' s terrible .
we must find her .
she has my cell .
not to mention all the loot !
but the cell was a gift from petra .
if china girl answers it , i' m for it .
did i just save your life ?
sure .
i' d have done the same for you .
so i' d die run over by a cop car .
hey , my driving' s getting better .
not your manners .
say thank you .
if we let the gang get away , my life' s worthless .
gibert will throttle me .
we' il find your gang !
now , say thank you .
how' il we find them ?
we' ve no leads , no clues !
is that good enough ?
what ?
sorry , pal .
i' m sorry .
my nerves are giving out .
i can' t take it .
china girl ...
she tortured me for hours .
i can' t forget .
she tortured you ?
it was horrible .
how ?
things i' d never tried .
you can' t guess ...
i can' t talk about it .
it still hurts ...
i understand .
don' t worry .
we' il find her !
come on !
did she mention anything ?
just a chopper that' s waiting somewhere .
and she had fur boots on .
fur boots ?
notice anything ?
no !
it' s cold .
yeah !
melted snow ?
if it' s still here , it came from high up and nearby .
with those boots they' re headed back there .
probably .
but why the mountains ?
on the other side ?
switzerland !
of course !
she' s half swiss it' s home field .
they drive up and ski across blending in with the tourists ...
all the way to their chopper .
that' s wonderful !
let' s find the resort closest to the border big enough for a chopper .
tignes val d' lsere !
see anything ?
not really .
patrol 1 : nothing to report .
so where to for the vacation ?
we' il head for the slopes .
now , let' s hope we were right and we spot their car .
you look right , i' il look left .
you don' t know left from right ?
right for you ?
sorry , my fault .
i took it as facing you .
you' re next to me .
but i thought you meant facing you .
what ?
the car !
told you .
try a shortcut .
first right .
you know tignes ?
they' re all alike .
trust my instinct .
i prefer to trust mine .
i' il take a right .
watch out !
that was close !
where are we ?
look for a sign .
what' s with all these cars ?
they must be from the ski school .
what' s that sign say ?
1 ' 1 0 " off the lead .
is that good ?
we' il improve next lap .
shit !
that' s screwed it .
look at the tracks .
a snowmobile !
we' il never catch them .
the chase is over .
it' s never over .
this isn' t about speed it' s about snow .
nothing' s impossible .
you like my winter collection ?
yeah , not bad .
you tried it out ?
not yet .
i' d say it works .
i' d say so .
but where' d they go ?
let' s follow the tracks .
yeah , i see .
well spotted .
can the taxi do a chopper too ?
maybe that' s asking too much .
i' d better warn the general then .
very good idea .
lend me your cell phone ?
she has mine .
transfer the cash .
we must be gone before sunset .
get to work !
you think they' re inside ?
hard to say .
hello !
operation snow white is underway .
we' il be there in 1 0 ' .
i have your chief here .
he insisted on coming along .
you sure this is a good idea ?
i served with an alpine regiment .
13th battalion , special section .
i know the mountains .
but this is high up .
you ever seen snow ?
i' m from grenoble .
i didn' t say a word .
let' s go !
everybody out !
i' il go take a look .
i wouldn' t .
i' il be 5 ' .
he just won' t be told .
ok , let' s stay together .

no need to muck up my seats !
it' s only water .
it' s snow !
snow leaves marks !
i' il clean your damn car !

i checked all my gear .
i' il be fine .
let' s go , guys !
what happened ?
wait for me !
the strap must be too short .
obviously it is .
you' re cutting it ?
too right .
there we are !
wait !
the next racer to set off is austria' s hans gherart one of the big favorites .
are we lost ?
if we follow the flags , we' il be ok .
first at kitzbuhel , now here at val d' lsere he' s crushed the competition .
he' s smashed the intermediate times .
he seems certain to be world champion .
victory is his for the taking ...
then again a taxi wins by a short head .
it' s too quiet .
souvenir ?
not where you' re going ?
just cleanse your mind .
take her away !
you' re not too bitter about being tortured for hours .
forgive and forget .
sure .
and gibert ?
he was supposed to be here .
an incoming gibert !
chief !
watch where you land !
no worries , emilien .
it' s only snow .
that has to be cold !
hey !

no , the woman i love is .
i want to be ready when it' s my turn .
someone' s stupid enough to have your baby ?
i' m very lucky .
and i made promises .
such as ?
to spend more time with her to be a great dad
the fridge ?
empty !
and to be a great husband if she' il marry me .
she believed you ?
no way .
it was perhaps the first big mistake of her life because i was truly sincere .
sincerity' s not the problem .
finding the time is .
the time to work at it .
