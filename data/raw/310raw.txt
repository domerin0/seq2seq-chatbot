sure , thelma .
well then , that lantern' il come in real handy .
we should just tow your car behind , too ... ... in case he steals the spark plugs .

here you go .
be careful .
smile .
sit down !
would you take care of this gun ?

psycho killers , or bears , or snakes .
i don' t know how to use it .
will you take care of it ?
put it away .
here , put it in my purse .
thelma , good lord .
so , whose place is this again ?
it' s bob' s , the day manager' s .
he' s gettin ' a divorce and his wife' s gettin ' this place ... ... so he' s lettin ' all his friends use it till he' s got to turn over the keys .
i' ve never been out of town without darryl .
how come darryl let you go ?
' cause i didn' t ask him .
shit .
thelma !
he' s gonna kill you !
well , he' d never let me go .
he never lets me do one goddamn thing , that' s any fun .
all he wants me to do is ... ... hang around the house while ... ... he' s out doing god only knows what .
well , you get what you settle for .
i left him a note .
i left him stuff to microwave .
thelma .
thelma , what are you doin ' ?
smoking .
hey , i' m louise .
i' il never make it .
can' t we just stop somewhere , for a minute ?
thelma , we' re not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is .
then , what difference would it make if we stopped .
come on , i never get to do stuff like this .
okay .
but it' s gonna be a quick stop .
fine .
i haven' t seen a place like this since i left texas .
isn' t this fun ?
you all want a drink ?
no , thanks .
i' il have a wild turkey straight up , and a coke back , please .
thelma !
what , tell me something .
is this my vacation or isn' t it ?
i mean , god , you' re as bad as darryl .
i' m sorry , it' s just i' m not used to seeing you this way .
i haven' t seen you this way in a while .
you' re usually so sedate .
well , i' ve had it up to my ass with sedate !
you said you and me was gonna get out of town and ... ... for once , just really let our hair down .
well , darling , look out ' cause my hair is coming down .
all right .
i changed my mind .
i' m gonna have a margarita ... ... and a shot of cuervo on the side .
all right !
what are a couple of kewpie dolls like you doin ' in a place like this ?
we left town  minding our own business .
' cause we wanted to have some fun .
louise here is mad at her boyfriend ...
we wanted something to eat .
you come to the right place .
you like chili ?
they got good chili .
harlan , you botherin ' these poor girls ?
hell , no , i was just bein ' friendly .
well , it' s a good thing they' re not all as friendly as you .
hey , your name' s harlan ?
i got an uncle named harlan .
you do ?
is he a funny uncle ?
' cause if he is , then he and i got something in common .
i don' t mean to be rude ... ... but i got something i got to talk to my friend about in private .
i understand .
i didn' t mean to bother you .
it' s just hard not to notice two such pretty ladies as yourselves .
you better dance with me before ... ... you leave , or i will never forgive you .
sure , that' d be fun .
jeez , louise , that wasn' t very nice .
can' t you tell when somebody' s hittin ' on you .
so what if he was ?
it' s all your years of waiting table has made you jaded ... that' s all .
maybe .
just relax , will you ?
you' re making me nervous .
all right !
that' s a good band .
wonder if darryl' s home yet .
wonder if jimmy' s got back .
why don' t you just tell him to get lost once and for all ?
why don' t you ditch that no good husband of yours ?
this one' s on harlan .
thanks .
well , look , jimmy' il come in off the road and you won' t be there ... ... and he' il freak out and call you like a hundred thousand times and ... ... sunday night you' il call him back ... ... and by monday he' il be kissin ' the ground you walk on .

hey , just calm down .
we were just having a little fun , that' s all .
looks like you got a real fucked up idea of fun .
come on .

louise .
louise , where are we going ?
i don' t know .
just shut up so i can think .
shouldn' t we go to the cops ?
i think we ought to tell the police .
tell ' em what ?
just what do you think we should tell ' em , huh ?
i don' t know .
just tell ' em what happened .
which part ?
all of it .
that he was raping me .
a hundred people saw you dancin ' cheek to cheek with him all night !
who' s gonna believe that ?
we don' t live in that kind of a world .
goddamn it , pull over !
all right .
thelma , i' m gonna ... ... stop someplace for a cup of coffee ... ... and then , just for a second , and then i' m gonna ... ... get it together .
and we' il ... ... figure out then what to do .
and everything' s gonna be fine , all right ?
everything' s gonna all right ?
now is not the time to panic .
if we panic now , we' re done for .
nobody saw it .
nobody knows it was us .
so , we' re still okay .
we just have to figure out what we' re gonna do next .
we just have to figure out ... ... what we' re gonna do .
i' il say one thing .
this is some vacation .
i sure am having a good time .
this is real fun .
if you weren' t concerned with having so much fun ... ... we wouldn' t be here now .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it just means shut up , thelma .
so this is all my fault , is it ?
i have to go to the bathroom .
sorry .
thanks , i' il try again later .
move back , people .
stand away from the line , please .
no , it' s secured until further notice .
could you identify ' em if you saw them again ?
hell , i told you 50 times .
yeah , i could identify ' em , but neither one of those two ... ... is the type to pull somethin ' like this .
you' re not exactly an expert witness but what makes you so sure ?
if waiting tables in a bar don' t make you ... ... an expert on human nature , nothin ' will .
i coulda told you harlan puckett was ... ... gonna end up buyin ' it in a parking lot .
i' m just surprised it didn' t happen sooner than this .
who do you think did it ?
has anybody asked his wife ?
i hope she did it .
lena , do you have any ideas or don' t you ?
well , if i had to guess i' d say it was ... ... some old gal , some old gal' s husband .
but it wasn' t neither one of those two .
the smaller one ... ... the one with the tidy hairdo ... ... she left me a huge tip .
you didn' t notice what kind of car they were driving , did you ?
it' s a nightclub , hal , not a drive in .
i don' t follow the customers out to the parking lot .
all right ?
lena , go on home .
you kept me here all night to ask me the same ol ' question ... ... over and over again .
ain' t you gonna offer me some teeny eeny , witty bitty little drink ?
behave yourself .
neither of those two was the murdering type , hal .
hi , this is jimmy
thelma , you in there ?
thelma come on !
we' re out of here , thelma !
we' re gonna need money .
how much money you have ?

why are you unpacking ?
you said we was just gonna take a nap .

well , when you figure it out just wake me up .
what the hell' s wrong with you ?
what' s that supposed to mean ?
why are you acting like this ?
acting like what ?
how am i supposed to act ?
excuse me for not knowin ' how to act when you blow somebody away !
help me to figure out what to do .
i' m trying to figure out what to do .
but you could try to help me .
i did !
i had a suggestion that we go to the police .
but you didn' t like that .
frankly , i' m out of ideas .
what' s the big rush ?
if we give ' em enough time , they' il come to us .
i' m sorry .
i' m just not ready to go to jail yet .
why don' t you ... ... go out to the pool and take a swim or something ... ... all right ?
now , i' il figure out what to do .
jimmy , this is louise .
i' ve been trying to call you .

i' il call you back in an hour .
thelma !
what ?

even if they didn' t do it , they most likely witnessed it ... ... so somebody better talk to ' em .
put out an apb , and see what we get back .
any reason to believe they' ve left the state ?
that' s certainly possible .
hal , why don' t we go ahead and let the bureau in on this ?
louise , don' t get mad , okay ?
but where are we going ?
oklahoma city .
jimmy' s gonna wire me some money
jimmy ?
did you talk to him ?
did you tell him ?
is he mad ?
no , and that' s what we gotta get straight now .
darryl' s been calling , mad as a hornet ... ... making all kinds of noise .
when you call him ... ... you gotta ... ... not tell him anything about this .
make sure everything sounds real normal .
i called the asshole at four o' clock in the morning .
he wasn' t even home .
i don' t know what he' s got to be mad about .
i' m the one that should be mad .
thelma ... ... i' m going to mexico .
i figure i can make it in ... ... two and a half days , but i' m gonna have to haul ass .
are you up to this ?
i mean , i gotta know .
this isn' t a game .
i' m in deep shit and i gotta know what you' re gonna do .
i don' t know ... ... l don' t know , louise , i mean ... ... l don' t know what you' re asking .
now , don' t you start flaking out on me !
goddamn it , every time that we get in trouble you just get blank or ... ... plead insanity or some such shit .
not this time .
i mean , this time things have changed .
everything' s changed .
but i' m goin ' to mexico .
i' m goin ' .
louise ?

i was afraid i missed you .
i got it .
i was afraid i couldn' t get a check cashed on saturday .
who did it ?
friend of mine who owns a club .
doug randall .
you didn' t tell him what it was for ?
no , i didn' t say what it was for .
i told him i was buyin ' a car .

that' s real good .
listen , where do i go ?
it' s a place called the vagabond motel .
it' s at 1921 north east 23rd .

thelma ... ... well then , i just don' t wanna say .
darryl ?
thelma ?

that' s good , that' s just sweet .
shit !
darling , you all right ?

no , i' m sorry .
you' re okay ?
is there something i can do for you ?
no , it' s okay .
crazy women .
excuse me , ma' am .
may i ask what direction you' re headed ?
i' m trying to get back to school , my ride fell through ...
i' m kinda stuck here like stink on stink .
so , i was thinking , if you' re goin ' my way or ... ... if i' m going your way ...
i think we' re going to oklahoma city .
but i' m not sure .
yeah , well , i' d appreciate it much .
well , see , it' s really not up to me .
it' s not my car .
we' d have to ask my friend .
but , she' d probably say no .
she' s a little bit uptight .
maybe it' s not such a good idea .
but , i thank you for your time .
but , you know , i can ask .
it wouldn' t hurt .
well , no , it wouldn' t hurt .
hey , louise .
this young man here' s on his way back to school ... ... and i thought since we' re going in the same direction ... ... we could give him a ride , huh ?
it' s probably not a good idea .
no , probably not , but i appreciate your time .
you all have a good day .
drive safe .
did you see how polite he is ?
he was sweet .
what ?
bye .
fill ' er up .
sure wish we could have brought him with us .
what' d darryl have to say ?
he said , " okay thelma ...
... l just wanted to make sure you was all right .
i sure hope you' re havin ' fun .
you deserve it ...
... after all you put up with me .
i love you honey .
so , how long before we' re in goddamn mexico ?
i just didn' t think it would hurt to give somebody a ride .
did you see his butt ?
darryl don' t have a cute butt .
you could park a car in the shadow of his ass .
i' m sorry .
i' m just not in the mood for company right now .
here , take this map .
i need you to find ... ... all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city .
i think we should stay off the interstate .
we' re too conspicuous .
looks like we could get on this road 81 here ... ... and head down towards dallas .
no , i don' t want to go through texas .
find some way we don' t have to .
wait .
what ?
you want to go to mexico from oklahoma ... ... but you don' t want to go through texas ?
you know how i feel about texas !
we' re not goin ' that way !
i know , louise , but we' re running for our lives .
i mean , can' t you make an exception ?
look at this map .
the only thing between oklahoma ...
... and mexico is texas .
i' m not gonna talk about this .
you find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will .
do you understand ?
no , louise , i don' t .
now , how come you never told me what happened to you there ?
look , you shoot off a guy' s head ... ... with his pants down , texas is not ... ... the place you wanna get caught .
now , trust me .
now , i' m not gonna talk about this anymore .
happy birthday , lady .
is the manager in ?
marian , there' s a police officer here .
all right , thelma .
all right .
okay .
the other night there was a murder out at the silver bullet .
a man was shot .
and we have some witnesses that saw a 1966 ... ... t bird convertible leaving the scene .
sort of speeding out of the driveway there .
and that vehicle is registered to one louise sawyer .
now we have reason to believe that your wife was the other occupant .
what ?
excuse me .
you' re standing in your pizza .
oh !
shit !
so tell me something , ms. thelma .
how is it that you ain' t got any kids ?
i mean god gives you somethin ' special , i think you ought to pass it on .
well , darryl , that' s my husband ...
darryl .
yeah , he says he' s not ready yet .
says he' s still a kid himself .
kinda prides himself on being infantile .
he' s got a lot to be proud of .
louise and him don' t get along .
well , that' s putting it mildly .
she thinks he' s a pig .
i know he' s a pig .
did you get married real young , ms. thelma .
well , i guess 18' s kinda young .
but we' d already been going out for four years when we got married .
out for how long ?
four years .
i never been with anybody but darryl .
oh , i' m sorry .
if you don' t mind me saying so ... ... he sounds like a real asshole .
it' s okay .
he is an asshole .
but most of the time i just let it slide .
you better slow down there , ms. louise .
that' s a cop up ahead .
maybe you got a few too many parking tickets .
we' il take you to oklahoma city and then you best be on your way .
all right ?
all right .
prints on the trunk of the car match those of thelma dickinson .
i' il be damned .
isn' t that strange ?
and the husband says a gun is missing .
she took a lot of stuff .
it looks like she maybe planned on being gone a while .
the strange thing is ... ... her husband said she would never touch that gun .
he got it for her ' cause he' s out late a lot ... ... but he said she' d never touch it ... ... wouldn' t learn to shoot it .
just kept it in a drawer for years .
what kind of gun was it ?
38 .
where are they ?
they were on their way to some guy' s cabin ... ... and they never showed up .
all right .
now i' m gonna go in
listen up , you two , i' m gonna go in ... ... it' s just gonna take a minute .
you two better say your good byes .
i' m here to pick up a money order for louise sawyer .
there' s nothing .
how about " peaches " ?
could you try code word " peaches " ?
did i hear somebody say " peaches " ?
my god .
jimmy .
that' s the secret word .
show the lady what she won , don .
what are you doin ' here ?
i just came to see you , baby .
can i have another room , please ?

same goes double for me .
who' s the cowboy ?
oh , this here ... this is j. d.
he' s a student .
we' re just giving him a ride to here .
and then he , louise said that he would have to go so ... ... l guess that' s where he' s going to .
he' s going .
i reckon that' s what i' m doing .
he' s gone .
have a good trip .
thank you .
nice meeting you .
that' s him goin ' .
i love watchin ' him go .
thelma kinda took to him .
well , we got you a room there , thelma .
go on in and take yourself a nice cold shower .
well , you know me , jimmy , i' m just a wild woman .
it' s our future .
what' re you gonna tell him ?
nothin ' .
i' m not gonna tell him a thing .
the least i can do is not make him any more of an accessory than he is .
you are so sweet to that guy .
you know , you really are .
imagine not wantin ' to drag him into this .
i didn' t ask him to come .
it' s like i said , it' s no different than any other guy .
he just loves the chase , is all .
he' s sure got his work cut out for him now , don' t he ?
thelma , just put a lid on it !
now ... ... l want you to just , you guard that money .
okay .
and if there' s any problem ... ... then you call me in room 21 1 .
i won' t wait up .
you want a drink ?
no .
why don' t you tell me what' s goin ' on ?
i' m not gonna tell you what' s goin ' on .
someday soon you' il understand why i can' t ... ... but i' m not goin ' to , so don' t ask me .
can i ask you one thing ?
maybe .
are you in love with somebody else ?
does this have somethin ' to do with another man ?
no , it' s not anything like that .
all right , what is it , goddamn it ?
were you just gonna leave for fucking ever ? !
what , did you fuckin ' kill somebody ?
when you start this shit , i' m outta here !
i' m sorry .
why don' t you come back over here and sit down ... ... and i wanna give you somethin ' .

try not to get too excited , louise .
i just ... ... flew across two states with that ring in my fuckin ' hand and ... ... you know i hate to fly .
you came all this way ... ... because you thought i was with somebody else .
no , that' s not why i came .
because , you know , i don' t want to lose you .
and i get the feeling like you' re gonna like split .
permanently .
that' s not a good reason to get married .
well , i thought that' s what you wanted .
i did .
but not like this .
louise ?
no , thelma , it' s me .
surprise .
i was just out there and i was just thinking that ... ... l know i' m supposed to be gone and all but ... ... you know .
and i' m not havin ' a turd' s luck getting a ride out in this rain .
i was just thinkin ' about you .
this is crazy .
i' m gonna get out of your hair , all right ?
well .
wait .
where you goin ' ?
ah , i don' t know .
you know .
nowhere .
you think i' m happy playin ' my one night gigs ... ... in ramada inn lounges ?
you think you' re the only one with dreams that don' t work out ?
we both got what we settled for .
i think maybe you just don' t love me anymore .
no , i do love you .
but i think it' s time to just ... ... let go of the old mistakes .
just chalk it up to ... ... bad timin ' .
i think it' s time to let go .
again .
come on .
you' re too easy .
come on .
all right , i' il do it .
here we go .
well , don' t leave ' em , just leave ' em there .
you see , this is an unfair advantage .
you got ... too much metal goin ' here .
you want to lighten the load a little bit ?
i think that' s better .
what do you think ?
yeah , okay .
take me , break me , make me mad !
watch your head .
careful .
oh , my head' s fine .
who are you , anyway ?
i' m the great and powerful oz .
who do you want to be ?
tell me , i know you' re not just some schoolboy .
nobody ever tells me shit .
oh , i' m just some guy .
guy whose parole officer ... ... is probably havin ' a shit fit right about now .
what do you mean , parole officer ?
what ?
are you a criminal ?
no , not no more , thelma .
let' s see , besides bustin ' parole i haven' t done one wrong thing .
what' d you do ?
i' m a robber .
you' re a bank robber ?
no .
i don' t rob no banks .
come on .
what' d you rob ?
well , let' s see .
let' s add it up here , i ... ... robbed a gas station ... ... a couple of convenience stores , liquor stores .
oh , my god .
how ?
come on .
see , first you pick your place , all right ?
then i just sit back and i watch it for a while .
wait for that right moment to make my move , see ?
that' s somethin ' you gotta know up here ... ... that shit cannot be taught .
yeah , then ... ... l don' t want to talk about this .
come on .
i do .
all right .
then i' d ... ... waltz right in , yep ... ... and i' d just kinda waltz on in and i' d say ... ... " ladies .
gentlemen .
let' s see who wins the prize for keepin ' their cool .
everybody down on the floor .
now , nobody loses their head , then nobody loses their head .
you , sir .
you do the honors .
take that cash and put it in that bag there ...
... and you got an amazing story to tell your friends .
if not , well , you got a tag on your toe .
you decide .
it' s as simple as that .
then i' d just slip on out .
and , get the hell out of dodge , yeah .
my goodness .
you were sure gentlemanly about it .
i' ve always believed that done properly ... ... armed robbery doesn' t have to be an unpleasant experience .
what ?
you' re a real live outlaw , aren' t you ?
i may be an outlaw , darlin ' , but ... ... you' re the one stealin ' my heart .
oh , smooth .
oh , you' re smooth .

what' d you do ?
take some kind of pill , makes you say all the right stuff ?
i' m chokin ' on it .

i think it' s probably not a real good idea right now .
but i' il catch up with you later .
on down the road .
well ...

i just want you to be happy .

in broad daylight and everythin ' ?
no , we shouldn' t , but i want to put some distance between us ... ... and the scene of our last goddamn crime !
oh , man , you wouldn' t have believed it .
it was like i' d been doin ' it all my life .

thelma .

this always happens when you' re in a hurry .

james lennox ?
yeah , who wants to know ?
arkansas state police .
hi .
thelma !
what ?
i want you to call darryl .
what for ?
i want you to find out if he knows anything .
if you think he does ... ... you gotta hang up the phone ... ... ' cause that means the police have told him ... ... and the phone' s probably tapped .
tapped the phone ?
what are you talkin ' about ?
come on , thelma .
murder one and armed robbery .
murder one ?
we can' t even say it was self defense ?
it wasn' t .
we were walkin ' away .
we got away .
yeah , but they don' t know that .
it was just you and me there .
i' il say he raped me and you had to shoot him .
that' s almost the truth .
it won' t work .
why not ?
because there' s no physical evidence .
we can' t prove he did it .
we can' t even probably prove by now that he touched you .
god .
this law is some tricky shit , isn' t it ?
how do you know about all this stuff ?
besides , what we gonna say about the robbery ?
there' s no excuse for that .
there' s no such thing as justifiable robbery .
all right , louise , will you ?
where' d you get this ?
stole it .
hi .
hi !
who' s the nut ?
that' s mrs. dickinson' s husband .
shit twice and fall back in it .
god .
where' d you get the $6, 600 in cash ?
a friend .
we spoke with a gentleman today .
he says he delivered ... ... very close to that same amount to a ms. louise sawyer .
do you know her , too ?
yes , sir .
i believe she was the woman drivin ' the car .
he said he took it to a motel in oklahoma city .
he also says that at that time he met a man .
he identified you through a series of mug shots .
he also told us that you and mrs. dickinson seemed " close .
is that true ?
well , sir .
you might say ... ... we had a meetin ' of the minds , yeah .
are you aware that mrs. dickinson ... ... and ms. sawyer are wanted in connection with a murder ?
murder ?
what , thelma ?
damn !
did they ever indicate that they might be on the run from the law ?
now that you mention it ... ... they might have seemed a little bit jumpy .
you know what ?
what ?
you' re starting to irritate me .
me , too .
well , that' il happen .
you two boys have a lot in common .
maybe i should just step out of the room for a sec .
i got a better idea .
do you mind if i speak to him alone , for a minute ?
what ?
what' d i do ?
nothin ' , that' s what .
tell you somethin ' , this is just a crock of shit ... ... mr. john fucking law .
son , i got a feeling about something and ... ... l just wanna ask your opinion .
do you think thelma dickinson would have committed armed robbery ... ... if you hadn' t taken all their money ?
get your foot off that table .
cat got your tongue ?
no , naw .
well , how do you know i took it ?
how do you know they didn' t ...
don' t you fucking lie to me !
there' s two girls out there that had a chance .
they " had " a chance .
and now you' ve screwed it up for them .
no .
and now they' re in some serious trouble .
i' m gonna hold you personally responsible ... ... for at least part of it if anything happens to them .
i got no feelin ' for you .
you' re either gonna tell me every damn thing you know ... ... so there' s a small chance ... ... that i can actually do them some good ... ... or i' m gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your life .
your miseries will be my goddamn mission in life .
yes , sir .
okay ?
yeah .
that' s right .
we understand each other ?
yeah .

officer .
i am so sorry about this .
would you let go of that ?
now , i really apologize , but would you put your hands on the steering wheel ?
if you get on that radio ... ... you' re gonna find out that we' re wanted in two states ... ... and probably considered armed and dangerous , at least i am ... ... and then our whole plan' s just gonna be all shot to hell .
louise , take his gun .
take his gun , louise .
it' s right there .
right .
i' m real sorry .
excuse me .
you want to step out of the car , please ?

i believe you do .
drive like hell .
the one thing i can' t figure out is ... ... whether these girls are real smart or just real lucky .
it don' t matter .
brains' il only get you so far ... ... and luck always runs out .
louise , we still going to mexico ?
yeah .
then , aren' t we going in the wrong direction ?
i figure if you take a state policeman ... ... shoot up his car , take his gun and lock him in the trunk ... ... it' s best just to get on out of the state if you can .
i heard that .
don' t ding my car !
i think i fucked up .
i think i got us in a situation where we both could get killed .
i don' t know why i just didn' t go to the police right away .
you know why .
you already said .
what' d i say , again ?
nobody' d believe us .
we' d still get in trouble , we' d still have our lives ruined .
you know what else ?
what ?
that guy was hurting me .
if you hadn' t come out when you did , he would have hurt me a lot worse .
and probably nothin ' would' ve happened to him ... ... ' cause everybody did see me dancin ' with him all night .
they would' ve made out like i' d asked for it .
my life would' ve been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now .
at least now i' m havin ' some fun .
and i' m not sorry that son of a bitch is dead .
i' m just sorry it was you that did it , and not me .
hello .
let me talk to slocombe .
she wants to talk to you .
hello , louise .
hey .
how are things going out there ?
weird .
we got some ... ... kind of a snowball effect happening here or somethin ' .
you' re still with us , though .
somewhere on the face of the earth ?
we' re not in the middle of nowhere , but we can see it from here .
i swear .
louise , i almost feel like i know you .
you don' t .
you' re getting deeper every moment you' re gone .
would you believe me if i told you this thing was an accident ?
i do believe you .
that' s what i want everybody to believe .
trouble is , it doesn' t look like an accident .
and you' re not here to tell me about it .
i need your help here .
did harlan puckett
i don' t wanna talk about that .
you wanna come on in ?
don' t think so .
then , i' m sorry .
we' re gonna have to charge you with murder .
do you want to come out of this alive ?
you know ... ... certain words and phrases just keep drifting through my mind .
things like incarceration , cavity search , death by electrocution ... ... life imprisonment , shit like that .
you know what i' m saying ?
so do i want to come out alive ?
i don' t know , i ...
... l don' t know .
i think ... ... we' re gonna have to think about that .
i' il do anything .
i know what' s making you run .
i know what happened to you in texas .
come on , louise .
don' t blow it .
we got it !
give it to me .
god !
max .
you gotta take me there .
no , hal , cannot do .
you' ve done your job .
i' m the only one ... ... she' s ever spoken to , max .
you' re no good to me , now .
there' s nothing you can do for me , now .
i don' t want anybody losing their heads .
you know what happens .
the volume gets turned way up ... ... and the next thing you know these girls are gonna get shot !
what ?
you' re not gonna give up on me , are you ?
what do you mean ?
you' re not gonna make a deal with that guy ?
i mean ... ... l just want to know .
thelma , i' m not making any deals .
i mean , i' d understand if you was thinkin ' about it .
in a way , you got somethin ' to go back for , jimmy ' n ' all .
jimmy' s not an option .
but ... ... l don' t know , you know ... ... something' s like crossed over in me .
i can' t go back , i mean ...
... l just couldn' t live .
i know .
i know what you mean .
anyway , we don' t want to end up on the damned geraldo show .
yeah .
they' re charging us with murder .
yeah , they say that we gotta figure out ... ... if we want to come in dead or alive .
gosh .
did he say anything positive at all ?
you awake ?
guess you could call it that .
my eyes are open .
me , too .
i feel awake .
good .
wide awake .
i don' t remember ever feeling this awake .
you know what i mean ?
everything looks different .
you feel like that , too , like ... ... you got something to look forward to ?
we' il be drinking margaritas by the sea , mamacita .
hey , we can change our names .
we could live in a hacienda .
i' m gonna get a job .
i' m gonna work at club med .
now what kind of a deal is that cop gonna have to come up with to beat that ?
have to be pretty good .
have to be pretty damn good .
but i do have some advice to pass along ... ... right here in the words of this song .
