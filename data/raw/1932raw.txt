they will say that i have shed innocent blood .
what' s blood for , if not for shedding ?
with my hook for a hand ... ... l' il split you from your groin to your gullet .
i came ... ... for you .
this is the scariest story i' ve ever heard , and it' s true .
it was a few years ago , near moses lake in lndiana .
clara was babysitting for the johnsons .
billy pulls up on his motorcycle .
she wasn' t dating billy .
she' d been dating michael for 6 months .
but she always had the hots for billy ... ... because he was , like , a bad boy and michael was ... ... just so nice .
so anyway , she decides that tonight' s the night ... ... she' il give billy what she never gave michael .
ever heard of candyman ?
his right hand is sawn off .
he has a hook jammed in the bloody stump .
and if you look in the mirror and you say his name five times ... ... he' il appear behind you , breathing down your neck .
do you wanna try it ?
so billy began .
candyman .
candyman .
candyman .
candyman .
no one ever got past four .
not here .
go downstairs .
i have a surprise .
she looked in the mirror .
and i don' t know why ... ... but she said it the last time .
candyman .
she turned out the lights .
what he saw turned his hair white .
killed her .
split her open with his hook , and then killed the baby too .
and billy got away ... ... but soon after , he went crazy .
my roommate' s boyfriend knows him .
so when did you first hear this story ?
my friend heard it on the radio .
it' s true .
the babysitter roasted the kid like it was a turkey .
so what' s the deal ?
you guys doing a page on serial killers ?
something like that .
that' s it .
we' re done .
thanks .
no problem .
see ya .
see ya .
seems they' re getting younger everyday .
remember the baby alligator craze ?
when they got too big , they were flushed down the toilet .
they live in the sewers now .
some of them are 30 feet long .
where did this happen ?
in miami .
they went blind and albino from living in the dark .
it wasn' t miami .
it was new york .
i read it in the paper .
well , then it must be true .
why would danny and diane both be suffering from the same delusion ... ... in two cities over 1 000 miles apart ?
let' s face it , folks .
there are no alligators ... ... in the sewers .
no , it' s round the campfire .
it' s bedtime stories .
see , these stories are ... ... modern oral folklore ... ... the unselfconscious reflection of the fears of urban society .
that' s lunch .
the dashing professor !
the lovely wife .
helen , you know everybody ?
harold , diane ... ... danny , stacey .
so keep up the good work .
thank you for your contributions .
see ya .
do you wanna tell me about her ?
what' s her name ?
stacey .
she could barely look at me , and she was blushing .
i guess it' s because she' s madly in love with me .
all those bursting adolescent hormones .
you don' t really think ?
no , of course not .
good .
i should hope not .
so what' s the matter ?
trevor ... ... you promised not to do the urban legends lecture this semester .
you knew we were getting data from the freshmen , so why did you ruin it ?
i love you , but i can' t hold up their education ... ... while you complete a thesis .
be realistic .
i have a curriculum to follow .
yes , i know .
so don' t be mad at me .
if you look in the mirror and say his name five times ... ... he' il appear behind you , breathing down your neck .
can i clean your room ?
sure , don' t mind me .
so billy began .
he looked in the mirror , and he said , " candyman , candyman , candyman
candyman , huh ?
you' ve heard of him ?
you doing a study on him ?
yes , i am .
what have you heard ?
everybody scared of him once it gets dark .
he lives over at cabrini .
my friend told me .
cabrini green ?
yeah , in the projects .
i don' t know too much about it .
but my friend knows about it .
her cousin lives at cabrini .
they say he killed a lady .
can i talk to your friend ?
sure .
kitty ?
what do you want ?
lady down here wanna talk to you .
she' s coming .
i' m helen lyle .
nice to meet you .
henrietta mosely .
and this is kitty culver .
tell her about the candyman .
all i know is ... ... there was a lady in a tub , and she heard a noise .
do you remember her name ?
i think her name was ruthie jean .
she heard smashing , like someone was making a hole in the wall .
so ruthie called 91 1 and said , " somebody' s coming through the walls .
they didn' t believe her .
they thought the lady was crazy , right ?
she called 91 1 again , and they still didn' t believe her .
when they finally got there , she was dead .
was she shot ?
no .
she was killed with a hook .
it' s true .
yeah , it is .
i read it in the papers .
candyman killed her .
yeah , but i don' t know nothing about that .
helen , this is sick .
this isn' t a fairy tale .
a woman got killed .
that' s not the half of it .
that' s cabrini green , unrecognizable today .
i won' t even drive past there .
heard a kid got shot there .
every day .
okay , now look carefully at this picture ... ... and then this one .
do you spot it ?
no .
it' s not cabrini green .
that' s this building , lincoln village .
my apartment was built as a housing project .
now take a look at this .
once built , the city saw there was no barrier from here to the gold coast .
unlike where the highway and the ei train keep the ghetto cut off .
so they made minor alterations .
they covered the cinder block in plaster and sold the lot as condos .
how much did you pay for this ?
don' t ask .
wait till you see this .
here' s proof .
the killer , or killers , they don' t know which ... ... smashed through the back of this cabinet .
see , there' s no wall there .
it' s only a medicine chest between us and the other apartment .
what are you doing ?
someone could be on the toilet .
no , the apartment' s vacant .
okay , now take a look .
that is amazing !
someone' s in there !
i saw a light go on !
there' s nobody there .
faking !
that' s not funny .
you didn' t scare me at all .
yeah , right .
you don' t believe that nonsense , do you ?
i don' t .
do you ?
all right ....
candyman , candyman , candyman , candyman ...
... candyman .
you chicken !
you have to do it five times !
come on .
trevor ?
oh , trevor !
who were you expecting ?
what time is it ?
it' s late and i' m smashed .
sorry i scared you .
what' s with the arsenal ?
it' s only eight blocks .
you got us dressed up like cops .
i just said dress conservatively .
well , we look like cops .
why try to scare me ?
i' m not !
i want you to think .
the gangs hold this area hostage .
let' s just turn around !
let' s just go back ... ... and write a boring regurgitation of the usual crap on urban legend .
we' ve got a real shot here , bernadette .
an entire community starts attributing daily horrors to a mythical figure .
would trevor and archie chicken out ?
in a second .
exactly .
all right .
wanna wait here ?
no .
then let' s go .
and lock the car .
where you going ?
just going inside .
excuse me , you can' t come up here .
just going to see a friend .
sure you' re not the police ?
look like 5 0 to me !
ask blondie where she' s going .
who' s she going to see ?
let' s take the stairs .
come on .
where you all going there ?
heads up , people !
5 0 coming up the back door !

this is where he crawled through , right ?
we found it .
let' s go .
wait a second .
okay , hang on to this .

when i get back , we' il go .

how are our two beautiful graduate students doing ?
trevor says you' re dabbling in my favourite subject .
i can' t wait to review your data .
i can fit you in tomorrow .
we' re not ready yet .
that' s precisely the moment which i can be of greatest assistance .
before you disappear down a path to academic bolivia .
i think i' ve been there .
actually , purcell , we' re about to bury you .
what ?
we' il have something in a week or so .
but we only went to cabrini today
cabrini green ?
candyman country .
if you' re after the hook man , read the paper i wrote about him ... ... 1 0 years ago .
you know the story , don' t you ?
then how are you going to bury me ?
the legend first appeared in 1 890 .
candyman was the son of a slave .
his father had amassed a fortune from designing a device ... ... for the mass producing of shoes after the civil war .
candyman had been sent to the best schools ... ... and had grown up in polite society .
he had a prodigious talent as an artist ... ... and was much sought after when it came to the ... ... documenting of one' s wealth and position in society in a portrait .
it was in this latter capacity ... ... he was hired by a rich landowner to capture his daughter' s virginal beauty .
of course , they fell deeply in love , and she became pregnant .
poor candyman .
her father executed a terrible revenge .
he paid a pack of brutal hooligans to do the deed .
they chased candyman through the town to cabrini green ... ... where they proceeded to saw off his right hand with a rusty blade .
and no one came to his aid .
but this was just the beginning of his ordeal .
nearby there was an apiary .
dozens of hives filled with hungry bees .
they smashed the hives and stole the honeycomb ... ... and smeared it over his prone , naked body .
candyman was stung to death by the bees .
they burned his body on a giant pyre ... ... then scattered his ashes over cabrini green .
hello .
anne marie ain' t in .
are you sure ?
yeah , she said you' d be back .
what' s your name ?
jake .
listen , jake , maybe you can help me out .
i wanted to find out about that woman who got killed .
do you know anything about that ?
her name was ruthie jean .
i don' t know nothing .
did anybody else talk about it ?
you know , it' s okay to talk to me ... ... jake ... ... because i' m not a cop .
so nobody will get in trouble .
i can' t say nothing , or candyman will get me .
candyman , huh ?
you scared of him ?
i ain' t scared of nobody .
but you' re crazy , walking here on your own .
it ain' t safe around here .
yeah , i know .
but i don' t scare too easy either , jake .
you know , you don' t have to tell me .
you could just show me .
and if you show me where candyman is , i' il make you a promise .
it' il be our secret .
unless you' re too scared .
somebody building a bonfire ?
yeah , for the party .
in there .
candyman' s in there ?
my friend charlie say so .
a boy got killed there .
who was he ?
ain' t sure .
charlie told me he was weird .
he was crazy ?
no , a retard .
his mom was in the store .
the boy had to go to the bathroom .
his mom is taking her time , choosing this , looking at that ... ... so the boy start moaning .
his mom get mad at him , send him across the street .
his mom is at the checkout .
she hears him screaming .
mommy !
there' s a big tough guy .
he runs over to check it out .
come out of there shaking and crying .
he only been in there five seconds .
come out of there , and his hair turned white .
i mean , it turned white , just like that !
was the boy murdered ?
worse .
he' s lying on the floor in a pool of blood , holding himself .
they found it floating in the toilet .
can' t fix that .
better off dead .
did candyman do this ?
you wait here for me , okay ?
okay .
hello ?
candyman !
oh , excuse me .
i' m done here .
i' il get out of your way .
listen , i don' t wanna interfere .
i' m not a cop .
i' m from the university of illinois .
i' il just get out of your way .
come on !
let me go !
you' re not being very smart !
my colleagues know i' m here and expect me back .
now let me go !
i hear you' re looking for candyman , bitch .
well , you found him !
we hear you' re looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
number four , step forward and say the line .
we hear you' re looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
number five , step forward and say the line .
we hear you' re looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
take them out .
number five .
good work .
how' d you catch him ?
we swept the place .
we work down from the top floor .
that way , you can flush them all out .
whole of cabrini is locked down now .
you' re lucky to be alive , ms. lyle .
did he kill ruthie jean ?
oh , no question .
killed that kid as well .
he ran the overlords .
we knew everything about him .
we couldn' t bring him in before , because no one would testify .
we can' t protect them down at cabrini green , and they knew that .
what about the little boy ?
jake ?
we don' t need him .
we have you .
hey , jake !
i wanted to thank you for saving my life .
i wanna go home !
we' il get you out of here .
you did good .
you said it was our secret .
you lied !
it still is , jake .
you don' t have to go to court .
candyman will get me !
candyman isn' t real .
he' s just a story .
you know , like dracula ... ... or frankenstein .
a bad man took his name so he could scare us .
now that he' s locked up , things will be okay .
candyman ain' t real ?
no .
hey , you !
slow down !
you' re supposed to be the invalid here .
look .
it' s much better today .
yeah , looks great .
come sit down .
did you already eat ?
no , of course not .
okay , good .
hey !
welcome back !
thanks !
let me see .
i' m so glad you' re okay !
i would have totally freaked .
yeah , but you know what bugs me ?
two people get murdered .
the cops do nothing .
a white woman gets attacked , and they lock the place down .
but this was a bad guy .
you put him away .
that' s all that matters .
oh !
i' ve got a surprise for you .
what ?
you' re not gonna believe it .
the pictures !
a photographer friend ... ... managed to save most of them .
the camera was smashed .
that' s not all !
some publishers are very interested ... ... since you made the local section .
we' re gonna be published .
i' il come over tomorrow .
we' il get started !
yeah .
okay .
helen .

helen .

i' m sorry , i have to go .
no need to leave yet .
but i' m late .
you are not content with the stories ... ... so i was obliged to come .
be my victim .
be my victim .
i am the writing on the wall ... ... the whisper in the classroom .
without these things , i am nothing .
so now i must shed innocent blood .
come with me .

we have absolutely nothing to say !
my client has not been charged .
some information indicates baby anthony was abducted and may still be alive .
the blood may be the dog' s .
a suspect was released today , after questioning .
we' il just have to follow this one as
they didn' t mention your name .
that' s good .
there' s no charges yet .
they think they' il find a body .
i' m afraid they' re shooting for murder one .
but i don' t think they have a chance .
do you think i did it ?
nobody believes that .
but it' s crossed your mind ?
is there anything ... ... any detail , however small , that you can recall ... ... that would help us substantiate your version of events ?
i blacked out .
i mean , i don' t know what happened .
i just woke up there , and there was blood everywhere .
can i get you anything ?
you sure ?
i' m supposed to go over to the campus and pick up some work .
i' m concerned about leaving you alone .
i' il be about 20 minutes .
trevor ?
where were you last night ?
i was here .
i was fast asleep .
i thought you were with bernadette .
look , honey ... ... l' m gonna stand by you .
we' re gonna get through this , okay ?
i' il be right back .
believe in me .
be my victim .
do you believe in me ?
keep away from me !
i have the child .
allow me to take you , or he will die in your place .
your disbelief destroyed the faith of my congregation .
without them , i am nothing .
so i was obliged to come .
and now i must kill you .
your death will be a tale to frighten children ... ... to make lovers cling closer in their rapture .
come with me and be immortal .

why do you want to live ?
if you would learn just a little ... ... from me , you would not beg to live .
i am rumour .
it is a blessed condition , believe me .
to be whispered about at street corners .
to live in the other people' s dreams ... ... but not to have to be .
do you understand ?
please , god ... ... don' t let him kill the baby .
trevor ? !
where are you going ?

all you have left is my desire for you .
helen !
you came to me .
the child .
we had a deal .
surrender to me now ... ... and he shall be unharmed .
we have a bargain .
but i' m afraid .
do you fear the pain ... ... or what is beyond ?
both .
the pain , i can assure you ... ... will be exquisite .
as for our deaths , there is nothing to fear .
our names will be written on a thousand walls .
our crimes told ... ... and retold by our faithful believers .
we shall die together in front of their very eyes ... ... and give them something to be haunted by .
come with me ... ... and be immortal .
you' re mine now .
it' s time for a new miracle .
it was always you , helen .
it was always you .
he' s here .
i' m coming .

we must be on our way now , you and l .
our bones will soon be ashes ... ... and we shall never be separated again .
let me go .
i cannot !
we are already dead .
come back to me !
come back !
we commend to almighty god our sister , helen .
we commit her body to the ground .
earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust .
the lord bless her and keep her and give her peace .
god of holiness and power , accept our prayers on behalf of helen .
do not count her deeds against her .
for in her heart , she desired to do your will .
may god bless you .
the father ... ... and the son and the holy spirit .
my god , look at that !
trevor ?
