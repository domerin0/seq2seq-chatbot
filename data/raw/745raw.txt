uh uh uh , what about him recordin ' me ?
oh , he' il record you , if we pay the freight .
scratch a liar , find a thief .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
this .
you see i saw jack lauderdale tonight , and he gave me a $500 advance on my record .
he also said he' il put me on the road with lowell fulson and pay me three times what you pay .
now , that' s a lie !
hey , no way he' s not gonna put some blind man on the road .
think about it .
i mean , you you need watchin ' out for .
and he ain' t got the time to look after you the way i do .
is that what you' ve been doing , gossie ?
watchin ' out for me ?
is that why you get paid double what i do ?

what do you want , man ?
i' m at church .
i' m sorry .
i' il come back later .
you' re here now .
what do you want ?
my company , atlantic records , has acquired your contract from swing time .
i' d like to discuss your future .
hold on .
don' t jive me now .
i ain' t for sale .
may i sit down ?
you see , mr. charles ,
jack lauderdale has found himself , shall we say , a little overextended , and has had to unload some of his talent .
when your name came up , i jumped at the chance to work with you .
i' m a big fan .
what if i want to go to another company ?
there' s a guy out there right now that is willing to pay me seven cents a record .
can you do that ?
man , i could promise you 15 cents a record , but you won' t get it any more than he' il pay you seven .
what i will do is promise you five cents a record and pay you five cents a record .
if you think pennies , mr. charles , you get pennies .
you think dollars , you get dollars .
i like how you put things together , man .
ahem , you know what ?
omelet , you' re all right with me .
ahmet .
ahmet .
what kind of name is that ?
i' m turkish .
well , you know what ?
i guess jack lauderdale' s bad luck is my good fortune .
i knew that atlantic records was bigger than swing time .
you guys do good music .

ray , i want to tell you something , and i don' t want you to take it wrong .
then give it to me right .
i signed you because i sensed something special in you not because you sound like nat cole or charles brown .

ray , i want you to meet my new partner , jerry .
mr. ray charles , jerry wexler .
hey .
don' t worry , ray .
i' m going to step back , i' m gonna watch ,
i' m gonna learn how to produce a record .
i' m in awe .
that was out of sight .
that' s some running and riffing , man !
well , this' il make you shout , man .
we' re listening to that new recording , mess around by atlantic recording artist , ray charles .
and we have the gentleman live here in the kcoh studios .
so , ray , when you' re not making your own music , what do you listen to ?
you know what , the fact is , king bee , i really and truly love gospel .
one of my favorite groups is from right here in houston : the cecil shaw singers .
ray charles endorses houston' s own cecil shaw .
we' il be playing gospel all day sunday but right now , let' s hear some more of that mess around by ray charles .
k. b. , line 1 .
king bee .
mmm hmm .
yeah , he' s right here .
miss della antwine of the cecil shaw singers .
hello , miss antwine .
you sung tenor in jesus is my shepherd , right ?
yes .
how did you pick me out ?
actually , i i hear like you see .
like that hummingbird outside the window , for instance .
i can' t hear her .
you have to listen .
yes .
yeah .
yes , you can .
oh oh .
you hear that ?
what ?
her heart just skipped a beat .
oh , did you like my record ?
the one that king bee was playin ' ?
it was very nice .
different than the others .
i' ve heard a lot of your music .
was it very nice , too ?
look , miss antwine , if you don' t really like the record , you ain' t got to beat around the bush with me .
i mean , my mama never did .
it' s not that i don' t enjoy your music .
it' s just that i feel i' ve heard it before .
i keep wondering what the real ray charles sound like .
ray charles ?
who' s he ?
nobody , if you don' t know .
huh ?
sorry .
i should have kept my mouth shut .
oh , no , no .
then you wouldn' t be you .
you know , it' s not like i haven' t heard that before .
i guess i just , uh , never really listened , that' s all .
ain' t nobody ever put it that sweet , i guess .
you know what , miss della bea antwine ?
you really are a country girl .
you know that ?
yes .
how' d you know ?
i could tell by the way you ordered .
let me get molasses with my cornbread .
were you raised on a farm ?
my mother did a little sharecropping in florida .
is she still there ?
god bless her heart , she passed away when i went to school .
ray , i' m sorry .
she never was real healthy .
she just worked herself to death , poor thing .
that' s why she didn' t want me carrying around no tin cup .
the kids i went to school with , they were doing basket weavin ' and wickerwork .
but not you .
because of your gift .
because of my ears .
see , i can mimic damn near anybody , and i i i i make a pretty decent living at it .
it' s just , if i change my style up and people really don' t dig it ,
i mean , what am i left with , you know ?
i mean , when you' re blind , miss antwine , you ain' t got that many choices .
seem to me like you got all the choices in the world .
god gave you the gift to sound
like anybody you please , even yourself .
we' re here .
this is where i live .
well , you think the preacher' d let me in ?
i mean , uh , i' m a sinner , but i need a little prayer .
his wife don' t like me having male company .
well , tell him there' s a soul out here that needs savin ' .
you know what , miss antwine , you really got me thinkin ' .
about what ?
about my life .
about my music .
about everything .
ray , don' t don' t you think we' re movin ' a little fast ?
listen , i' m i' m gonna go to new york for a couple of weeks , and when i get back , you can take it as slow as you want .
all right , mr. charles .
all right , miss antwine .
i' il see you in a couple of weeks .
well , hold on , now .
let me call you a cab .
i got it .
three blocks up ,
left for two , right for one .
fifteen giant steps , and i' m at the crystal white hotel .
hello .
mess around was a positive step for us , ray .
we' re making progress .
oh , come on , ahmet .
now , you' ve been nice to me .
but i haven' t given you guys any hits .
atlantic records has been good to me , but if you want me to do something special ,
i' m gonna need my own band .
oh , man .
taking a band out on the road costs a mint , ray .
i mean , even joe morris is struggling .
his band' s had a hit record .
but , ahmet , listen , i' m not joe morris .
man , you told me if i think pennies , i get pennies .
i' m thinking dollars , man .
ruth brown' s got a tour booked in georgia .
she needs a band .
i i' il take it .
i could write the charts for her , i i could do backup , and also be an openin ' act .
okay .
but you' re going to be financially responsible .
you' re gonna have to make it work , ray .
yeah , yeah , i' m gonna make it do what it do , baby .
yeah .
ray !
miss antwine , it' s been two weeks .
it' s been three .
now , where' s the preacher at ?
and the wife ?
they in dallas till monday .
well , hallelujah !
della bea .
kind of like a honey bee , right ?
can i call you bea ?
yeah , i' d like that .
there' s only been two cats that i ever really trusted in my life .
there' s jeff brown , he' s going to be my tour manager ,
fathead newman , my tenor man and now you .
but you gotta do me a favor .
bea , you gotta always tell me the truth .
oh , yeah .
just like you did before .
don' t feel sorry for me just ' cause i' m blind .
how could i pity someone i admire ?
can i play something for you ?
now ?
yeah .
no , ray .
yeah , right now .
right now .
i' m gonna ...
ray !
it' s right there .
you got it .
okay .
yeah , yeah , this will work .
now you go ahead and play .
i' m gonna close these drapes .
all right .
i don' t want no neighbors looking in .
ray .
ray !
ray .
ray , that' s sacrilegious .
what what ?
it' s a gospel song .
i know what it is .
i wrote it .
i mean , you told me to find my own voice .
well , bea , this is it .
but it it ain' t it ain' t right to be changing gospel music into this .
into what ?
is it is it devil music ?
evil music ?
do you think do you think i' m evil , bea ?
look , i' ve been performing gospel and blues all my life .
it' s who i am .
and if i' m gonna do my own thing , i i gotta be natural , right ?
i' m singing about my feelings for you .
about how i love you .
what could be more natural than that ?
huh , bea ?
tell me .
more natural than me and you .
ray .
so we bite the bullet , we cancel the tour dates .
but what the hell are we gonna tell ray ?
ruth brown' s pregnant , so there' s no tour .
what about lavern baker ?
get lavern baker to take the tour .
she doesn' t have a record .
there' s nothing to promote .
you and jesse get up there , write a couple of songs ,
let' s get her in the studio .
it' s gonna take a month to do that
what are we gonna do ?
we got to do somethin ' .
ray' s got a whole new band up there .
how the hell did he put together a band so fast ?
boss !
boss , they' re here .
come on .
let' s get together so we can show ' em this . ... break this to ray .
oh , you' re gonna let me break it to ray ?
why me ?
because ruth brown was your idea .
ruth brown is a good idea , ruth brown was a good idea , and still is a good idea .
shh !
ahmet .
yeah .
we gotta get this on wax .
oh , yeah .
hear that , new york ?
the sound is huge !
but there' s only seven cats on this record .
this is the new ray charles , baby , and there' s nothing out there like it !
and you heard it first on the moondog show !
the shaw agency' s the best booker on the chitlin ' circuit , that' s my opinion .
milt shaw , meet ray charles .
ray , it was milt' s dad , billy , who first drew my attention to a certain blind pianist when he was booking lowell fulson .
ray charles .
we believe in your talent .
we wanna be in the ray charles business .
we' ve already got you booked on a 10 city tour with roy milton' s solid senders
oh , roy milton , i love him . ... and tangula the exotic shake dancer .
she is gorgeous .
ray , i gotta tell you , we think you' re onto something very big here .
nobody' s ever combined r& b and gospel before .
i' ve got a woman is a smash .
you better start thinking about a follow up , my friend .
right now .

i gotta run to texas and take care of some business , and , i' il be right back .

well , bea , you know i' m gonna be on the road for most of the year .
