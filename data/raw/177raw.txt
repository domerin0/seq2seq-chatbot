i won' t leave !
i want kit to see that i' m in my new life
can you give me a chance to prove myself ?
don' t you see i want to skate
riding bicycle with him too ?
i don' t want to lose this brother

ho
i kept mark because of you
your brother is following everything
if it wasn' t you he' s dead already !
shing , one is my brother the other is my friend
how would i feel comfortable if i said yes ?
it doesn' t matter for you to insult me
but not my friends
if you hurt my brother
you won' t live long
we' ve wanted mark lee for 3 years
but we can' t take him back legally
otherwise , we can control the syndicate
the roc police dept is willing to give information to the interpol to the hong kong government
the us government has also taken action

don' t give up
don' t let the other look down upon you
why can' t you forgive him ?
let him start a new life ?
he killed dad indirectly !
why do you force me to accept him
he can' t blame anyone for choosing the wrong way
i' m the cop , he' s the thief
we' re going opposite
i' m a cop
what' s happening ?
kin !
your brother is having an operation
he' s now in princess margaret hospital
hurry up !

he is being tricked by shing
he purposely did it
how is he ?
you can' t get in
i tried to stop him
but he insisted
i hope you can cooperate with the police and let' s know your location
it' s easy to be a hero , jump
it' s not the same now you don' t have any choice
get along with us
and don' t tell the police
we know each other well
what' s happening ?
you are out of this case
stop !
fight !
stop it !
can we make a deal
it' s not worthwhile breaking rules again
stop fighting
release him
ho !
you idiot , don' t go !
stay if you have guts !
you , son of bitch !
all bastards !
kin .
that' s my fault
i don' t want you to be involved
you' ve no principle
they fight because they are scared
if you hit them back then they win
why do you want to change ?
what for ?
who' s he ?
kin !
ho !
come and have a look
come over
mark ...
emergency box
quick !
kin , what shall we do ?
you go !
police .
stop for searching
that' s too much , officer , i' m injured !
i' il send the quotation to the station
smart ass
i did notice the beauty of hk at night
but it doesn' t last
it' s not worthwhile
ho !
let' s start all over again
after this last time then leave hk
mark !
we' ve never been scared before
why are we scared of shing ...
don' t push me i' il never get involved again
those are merely memories
i' m still alive
even you do 10 times , 100 times
then what ?
even you kill shing ?
i lost my brother already
i don' t want to lost you too
mark , don' t you understand ?
i don' t want sympathy
you didn' t owe me anything ?
i never force my friends doing things unwillingly
i' ve my principle
i don' t want to loose for my whole life
do you think i like begging ?
i' ve been waiting 3 years for this one chance
the only thing to prove is not my brilliance but my determination to regain the losses
what did you look like ?
we were scolded when we were bad
but when we turn to be good we are being followed !
did you fight for a chance ?
you didn' t
no !
same as you
mark !
what happened to you ?
i just want to take back something
stand over that side
go and take the plate
you' il be in big trouble
think twice before you do it
stop for a moment
run !
open the door !
thanks , mr , chan !
go after them
you idiot !
i told you that' s too much
idiot
if ho hands the plate to the police
not only you will die but even the syndicate will collapse
that' s enough
don' t call me idiot
what did you call me when i gave you money ?
i regret to have you
i' il kill you if you don' t bring me back the plate
kill me then
i betrayed ho 3 years ago
would i be scared of him now ?
you have to pay him back
