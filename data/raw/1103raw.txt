we' re in okinawa and we' re about to go swim with some whale sharks but first ... we need to go rub one out .
well , i made the mistake of showing them what sea cucumbers do when they' re threatened and that is , you know , as soon as something touches them , these white threads come out of the end of it and , uh , steve o and chris thought it was a great idea .
so , they' re out there trying to , uh ...
masturbate ? ... masturbate , yeah .

this is the ...
with a simple shave of the razor
steve o easily disguises himself ... to fool the whale sharks into thinking he' s a harmless young boy .

i feel like i have to shit my ass .
is there anything intact ?
you said that you didn' t want to do it because your dad would disown you ?
well , i mean , it wasn' t that .
you drank wine off of a dude' s ass crack .
my dad never saw that .
i never told him that ... you know .
i was gonna do this and i was like , " dad " ...
i was , like , " dad , we' re going hard these days and there' s some ideas floating around .
i just mentioned the car in the butt .
my dad , like ... the only time in my life
i ever heard my dad , like ...
you know , it' s like when your parents say ,
i' m not mad at you ; i' m just disappointed , " you know
like , that hurts so much more , you know ?
fucking rad .
look at him walk .
john' s gonna win , dude .
i' m not too excited about this skit .
it' s not my favorite i' ve ever done , because there' s a toy car in my butt but this is the ...
i think i need an x ray .
antoine ?
yes ?
how you doing ?
pretty good .
i' m ryan , and this is ...
what can i do for you ?
i was partying last night with some frat guys .
i passed out .
i must have fallen down or broken something , because i haven' t been able to walk right since .
we' re gonna take x ray now , to be sure .
okay .
take one of those .
oh , okay .
this is comfy .
hold your breath .
don' t move .
what' s that ?
i have no idea .
that' s not part of you .
that' s something extra .
i would' ve known if i ate that .
no .
you wouldn' t be able to swallow that .
that is a car toy .
well , how did a car toy get there ?
maybe you stuck it up your ass .
i didn' t stick anything up my ass .
have you ever seen anything like that ?
no , i never seen that in there .
i' ve seen a toy car all over but never in somebody' s rectum .
you can' t get it out ?
you don' t have ...
no , i ...
i' m a physician , but i practice this , x ray only .
you think maybe i can just , you know , poop it out ?
you won' t be able to poop it out .
in fact , it will hurt you .
i fact , i don' t think it' s even good for you that you poop it out .
what will happen if you take ex lax ?
will that help ?
no , if he takes ex lax , well , he gets a lot of diarrhea but no car .
i appreciate it .
thank you for taking care of me .
okay .
thanks again .

oh , child !
let' s see it !
let' s see it !

moments like this never last
when do creatures rape your face
hybrids opened up the door ...

your face is momentary
you hide your looks behind these scars
in hybrid moments
give me a moment ...
oh , fuck ! ... give me a moment
oh , fuck !

ooh , baby , when you cry
your face is momentary
you hide your looks behind these scars

give me a moment
give me a moment ...
whose dick do i gotta suck to get some explosions around here ?
i can' t expect you to see me when i' m not around
and my voice is destroyed by confinement of sound
i' m a human machine laced with hidden disease
if the future looks bleak , then you' re connected to me
flesh into gear
my self appears dissected and pretentious
a simple sound , a heavy sigh
could win the whole world over
you live in fear of being someone you didn' t want to
he' s got a boner .
i realize your insecurities will get the best of you .
oh !
oh , fuck !
it' s a man .
whoa !
ow !
whoa !
ow !

i took advice no fool would take ...
i think it says , " fuck , " on my forehead . ... i got some habits i can' t shake ...
they don' t have a tail ?
no !
they must have taken them out . ... i ain' t the sharpest knife in the drawer
but i know enough to know
if you' re gonna be dumb , you gotta be tough ...

... lf you' re gonna be dumb , you gotta be tough
when you get knocked down , you gotta get back up ...
i mean , trust me , dude , i' m not unimpressed . ... that' s the way it is in life and love
if you' re gonna be dumb , you gotta be tough
if you' re gonna be dumb , you gotta be tough .
