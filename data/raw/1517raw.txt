it was a nightmare .
so many dead people .
so many victims .
it all started a few days ago ... when i came here for a rave .
and , now , all that remains is the rotten smell of death .
you must stop curien ... or else something terrible will happen !
nice .
so , where are they , dude ?
we' re gonna miss the boat .
greg and simon .
greg' s the guy i played ball with in college .
a good guy , if not a little goofy .
simon .
they say god doesn' t give with two hands , and they were right .
he got the looks , but not much between those ears .
cynthia ...
greg' s girlfriend .
pure eye candy .
i' m simon .
karma .
thinks she' s foxy brown .
she has a crush on simon , but simon only has eyes for alicia , my ex .
we broke up a few weeks ago so i could study and she could fence .
she loves it .
i don' t see what it' s good for .
anyone have one of those invitations with the map on it ?
are you sure this is where the boat' s supposed to leave from ?
maybejohnnie gave you the wrong info .
yeah , hon .
i' m pretty sure .
it says here the boat doesn' t leave until 5 : 00 .
yeah , and it' s 5 : 15 now , simon .
shit .
we' re so fucked .
they missed the boat to the rave .
if only they decided to stay back in seattle ... they' d all be alive today .
unbelievable .
it' s going on all weekend .
you gotta come .
and you' il never guess who' s here .
hello ?
the cell phone reception' s for shit out here .
hello , sweetie ?
i' m losing you .
are you there ?
hello ?
shit !
now , where was it you wanted to take me to ?
i was trying my best to function as a single guy should .
but at the back of my head , something was nibbling away at my subconscious .
hello ?
what you doin ' over there ?
good evening .
beautiful day , isn' t it ?
you got yourself some sort of hearin ' disability ?
i asked you a question .
i' ve come to charter your boat , sir .
you do , huh ?
well , that' s too bad ...
' cause this here' s a fishin ' boat , not the pacific princess .
why don' t you try the yellow pages ?
we gotta get to this party on an island , and we were hopin ' to use your boat .
you' re not the sharpest tool in the shed , are ya ?
i said , shove off .
or don' t you sprechen sie englisch ?
why don' t you just name your price , and we can skip ... the old man on the sea routine .
a man' s gotta eat , right ?
what part of" shove off " didn' t you understand ?
hold it .
geez .
who' s the u boat commander ?
what ?
how much ?
$300 sound fair ?
about 600 might .
six hundred ?
no way .
no one is talking to you .
where are you headed , girls ?
huh ?
i don' t know .
we got this map .
it' s somewhere in the san juans .
you must know where that is , right ?
you crazy ?
they crazy .
no , i don' t think so .
excuse me ?
i said , forget it .
yeah , forget it .
forget it .
that means stop talkin ' , start walkin ' .
why ?
why ?
why ?
why ?
they always ask " why .
you know what they call this island ?
isle del morte .
morte .
that' s spanish for " death , " in case you don' t speak mexican .
well , listen , friend , i got me an island to catch right here .
and if this is some lame attempt to hit me up for more cash ...
it ain' t .
there ain' t enough cash in the world to make us go back there .
keep the cash .
keep the cash .
let' s get out of here .
fuck it .
a grand .
what do you say 500 now , and another five on the way back ?
you can be mighty persuasive if you wanna be , mr ...
simon cruz .
and you are ?
kirk' s the name .
wait , wait .
captain kirk ?
does that make him mr. spock ?
i don' t like no captain kirk jokes .
now , let' s shove off before you say something else you' il regret .
all right .
it' s all good .
cap' n !
cap' n !
i' m not goin ' .
i' m not goin ' .
there' s evil spirits on that island .
you just get the deck lines and let me worry about the evil spirits , okay ?
ahoy there , captain kirk .
this is the united states marine patrol .
stand down and prepare to be boarded , captain .
oh , shit !
what are you gonna do ?
we have no choice .
we got to do what the lady says .
it' il delay our departure for a while , though .
delay us ?
for how long ?
well , i imagine they' re looking for guns , drugs , who knows what .
it' il probably take ' em a few hours .
and that' s only if they don' t find nothin ' .
how much to lose ' em ?
did you forget what today is ?
you can lose them , right ?
sure i can .
who' s talking , alexander hamilton , ben franklin or you ?
it' s the second friday of the month . !
do it .
just a routine inspection , kirk .
don' t even think ofleaving my harbor .
heave to . !
where the hell do you think you' re going ?
heave to . !
this is casper .
mcgyvers and i are moving out .
over .
hate to break this to you , kid , but i would have done it for free .
the lady needs to dine on a humble pie once in a while .
so you' ve run into her before ?
run into her ?
hell yeah .
she' s had a hard on for me ... ever since we got out of the service ... and i didn' t start working for uncle sam like she did .
can' t blame her for still getting wet over me , can ya ?
sweet .
come on .
come on what ?
let' s go swimming .
now ?
you' re crazy .
you' re pretty enough to eat .
you' re nuts , baby .
come on .
all right .
oh , yeah .
come on .
oh , my god .
that' s cold , baby .
come on , you big wimp .

yeah , fine .
it' s fine once you get in .

you' re no fun .
he' s heading out to the san juan islands , cap .

i don' t want him to make us yet .
cynthia' s such a trooper .
don' t come near me .
must' ve eaten something back at the ...
you know what ?
whatever you say , baby .
god , it' s cold .
i know .
greg , you look like shit , man .

this' il make you feel better .
on my face !
oh , yeah .

come on , matt !
come on , matt .
don' t play games .
matt , where are you ?
what a mess .
what an idiot .
did you get a real good peek there , perv ?
i wanna give this to you .
what' s this for ?
it' s for your protection .
it' s okay .
i' m on the pill .
it' il ward off evil spirits .
it' il protect you and your friends from harm .
whatever , gandalf .
matt , where are you ?
i' m lost .
where are you ?
what is that ?
what is this ?
are you in there ?
are you in there ?
is that you , matt ?
oh , my god !
hey , cap , i can get a little closer to ' em .
yeah .
let' s keep our distance and see where he' s headin ;
slow down , slow down .
come on .
did you hear that ?
shallow water !
okay , salish .
hey , guys , there it is .
yes !
yes !
finally !
easy , now .
almost there .
shut it down !
i' m so excited !
finally !
i know where they' re docking .
drop me off on the other side of the island .
you want me to radio for backup ?
nah .
i think i can handle victor myself .
okeydoke .
they' re on their way .
what do you wanna do now ?
let' s go .
i found a spot for our merchandise .
start unloading .
if casper comes after us ... she won' t find anything left on board to arrest us for .
yeah , right up here .
wait .
wait .
let me see that a second .
well , you' re obviously no cartographer .
what ?
come on .
it' s this way .
smart too , isn' t she ?
yep .
smart enough not to get involved with the likes of you , bro .
what' s this ?
come on .
smells like someone farted up there .
look at all these bubbles .
it' s disgusting .
seems like a storm' s comin ' up .
maybe so .
but that' s all right .
keeps casper off our ass if she tries coming after us ... while we blow on out of here .
what about the kids ?
we can' t leave ' em alone .
this is a bad island .
i ain' t waiting around for ' em , not if we have a chance to slip past casper .
you' d better keep unloading .
all right .
fine .
then we' il come back next week when the heat is off , huh ?
you hear somethin ' ?
no , nothing .
where is everyone ?
come on , karma .
i can' t believe this .
it' s their loss .
we have this entire place to ourselves ... to dance the night away , and i intend to put it to good use .
i' m not so sure that' s a good idea .
you would say that .
do you mind if everybody isn' t miserable , like you ?
yeah , you know what ?
i remember when she used to be fun .
when was that , kindergarten ?
how funny .
you' re funny .
i think something bad' s happened here .
like what ?
well , they sure as hell did not go to 7 11 to get more booze ... because the keg is full .
right on .
cheers .
chin chin .
salud . !
l ' chaim . !
well , what the fuck ?
doesn' t this bother any of you ?
we' re on the island where the rave of the year' s supposed to be happening ... but it' s completely deserted .
yeah , it worries me .
it worries me there aren' t any mixers .
simon cannot survive on bud alone .
speak for yourself , dude .
i don' t know about you , but i' m gonna go find out where everyone went .
okay ?
is anyone else coming ?
hell no .
me and cyn are gonna ... groove to some funky tunes all night long , right , baby doll ?
you know it , sugarplum .
okay , you know what ?
i' m coming with you .
i' m starting to get diabetes from all this " sugar , sugar " over here .
what about you , studly doolittle ?
three' s not company in this case .
i think i' il join you .
good .
we need a big , strong man to protect us .
problem is , there' s never a big , strong man around when you need one .
all right , let' s go .
why do i always end up doin ' this shit work ?
cap' n , is that you ?
hello , cleveland !
cut it out .
what ?
why ?
because i said so .
said so , huh ?
maybe i should just ...
wait , wait , wait .
i think i feel some rain coming .
why don' t we ...
i think it might ...
i think it might rain .
why don' t we go somewhere where we won' t get wet ?
too late .
close the velcro .
beautiful velcro .
we are gonna do the humpity bumpity .
come on , baby .
the humpity bumpity !
yeah , baby !
one , two , three !
wait , wait , wait , wait .
what if the others come back ?
i can be quick .
what else is new ?
hey , don' t ...
don' t take it personal , greg .
a lot of men have these problems .
i just gotta take a piss .
not in here , you idiot !
go pee in the bushes !
christ , i just ...
i just gotta go and take a piss is all .
all this beer' s gotta go somewhere .
for god' s sakes .
be right back .
hello ?
it' s so quiet .
it' s a gorgeous night .
why don' t we play for a little while ?
shall we ?
why don' t you just stick to playing with yourself for now ?
by the way , what' s with the accent ?
i don' t know .
salish , are you done yet ?
better hurry back , baby .
mama' s gonna give it to ya .
greg , you' re scaring me .
come on , baby .
will you get a load of that ?
what the hell is it ?
looks like it was built a millennia ago .
simon , it' s centuries .
right .
well , that' s what i meant .
should we go in ?
i am not going in there .
unless there' s a spa and a 24 hour room service , you' re on your own , hon .
well , are you coming , or am i going in myself ?
didn' t you ever watch scooby doo ?
this is so not a good idea .
i am completely not in favor of doing this .
well , the candles are lit .
i mean , someone must be home .
hello ?
alicia , watch out !
what the fuck ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
where is everyone ?
shut the door !
you broke my glasses .
great .
nice .
okay , what is going on here ?
we' il show you .
come on .
i' ve got it on tape .
sorry .
i have a lot of footage here .
i' il just fast forward .
everyone was partying , you know .
drinking and dancing and just hanging out , having fun .
and then these things came and they attacked the rave .
they started killing everybody .
those of us that could get away did .
we ran .
we finally got to the boat , but it wasn' t there .
these things , they just kept coming and coming and killing .
we found this house .
we ran inside and tried to hide .
that' s when you guys came .
we thought you were more of them .
them " ?
who the hell is " them " ?
who " ?
try " what .
rudy , they were dead people .
okay , guys , you saw the tape .
those are reanimated corpses just like out of a fuckin ' romero movie .
a what ?
a romero movie .
night , dawn and day .
they say he' s gonna make twilight of the dead one day , but i doubt it .
yeah , i find this all a little hard to believe .
it was a stunt .
it was part of the rave .
it wasn' t a stunt , alicia .
you know what ?
simon says let' s get out of here and let the cops ask questions later ... while we' re kicking it back in seattle selling our story to the enquirer .
sounds great .
you got a boat ?
yes , down at the beach .
thank god .
then let' s not waste any more time yakking .
let' s just go !
we can' t .
we still have friends back at the rave .
we' re not gonna leave them .
we gotta get out of here while we still can .
we' re not leaving without them .
okay .
let' s go .
so , you came with that girl ?
what ?
let me give you a tip .
i don' t think she' s a natural red , white and blue .
met her at the rave .
so , who' s your boy over there ... with the tom cruise smile and the rain man brain ?
he just so happens to be the biggest underwear model in america .
congratulations .
that' s great .
you okay , simon ?
sure .
where the hell are they ?
greg ?
cindy ?
please , do not do that .
you' re being taken , hugh .
this is all just one big practical joke .
if you' d been here , which you weren' t , you wouldn' t think it was a joke .
believe me .
what is that ?
i' m so not touching that .
hold this .
let' s flip it over .
liberty .
holy ...
dude , what the fuck happened to you ?
i was in there , and then all of the sudden ... the frickin ' ... the banging , and then the frickin ' thing fell over .
and i was stuck inside .
shit !
you' re in deep shit , huh ?
that' s very funny .
get that fuckin ' ...
who are you ?
where' s cyn ?
i don' t know , bro .
you tell me .
we gotta go find her .
where the fuck did that come from ?
what is ...
oh , my god !
what is ...
cynthia !
what the hell was that thing ?
our best friend .
not anymore .
she was like a wild animal .
did you see here face ?
oh , my god !
it' s horrible !
what happened to her ?
everybody hold on a minute .
maybe i can get us some answers .
mcgyvers , come in .
this is casper .
come in .
over .
it' s out .
i' m not getting anything on the radio .
anyone have a cell phone ?
we already tried .
it' s not working .
there' s some sort of interference .
look , i don' t know what' s going on .
what i do know is i' ve gotta get you all off this island .
how did you get here ?
on a boat like everyone else .
but it' s gone .
it' s been destroyed .
we didn' t .
we came in the lazarus with kirk .
where is he ?
he' s in the inlet down at the beach .
can you take me to him ?
are you gonna arrest him ?
not at the moment .
right now ...
i just wanna get you all as far away from here as possible .
sounds like a plan to me .
i am so fucking scared , simon .
i know .
me too .
i just can' t believe cynthia' s dead .
i' m so sorry , alicia .
quiet , everybody .
everyone , quiet .
shit !
can we go home now , please ?
let' s get out of here !
come on !
move it !
let' s go !
go !
oh , shit !
kirk !
it' s gotta be down here !
it' s gotta be down here !
all right .
where is it ?
oh , god , that' s not kirk .
simon !
don' t jump in the water !
simon , don' t !
no , don' t !
simon , don' t go !
swim , simon !
swim !
look out !
go , go , go !
get out of the water , simon !
shoot him !
rudy , behind you !
swim , simon !

liberty !

what do you think i' m trying to do , you fucking moron ?
come on .
come on .
fuck !
you fucking zombie bastards !
you' re not gonna fuck with us again , are ya , asshole ?
are you ?
are you ?
my face !
you all right ?
let me see .
let me see .
could i have your coat ?
oh , fuck !
here , let me see it .
let me look .
fuck !
let me see it .
are you a doctor ?
hardly .
he' s premed .
i' m in med school .
at least you' re not pre law .
oh , my god .
let me see .
is that a bite ?
yeah .
all right .
hmm ?
i' ve gotta get back to the patrol boat .
i can get on the radio and get us help .
wait .
are you just gonna leave us here while you go looking for the cavalry ?
you' re coming with me .
me ?
why me ?
are you a doctor ?
are you wounded ?
can you use a gun ?
well , i can ...
that' s why you .
the boat should be a mile or so up the beach .
we' il climb aboard and come back for help .
understood ?
come on .
greg .
my name' s greg .
come on , greg !
hey , what the hell were those things ?
i don' t know .
but what i do know now is why they call this island isle del morte .
you gotta do this .
you gotta do this .
there must be some kind of scientific explanation for this .
liberty' s right .
they gotta be some kind of mutation .
yeah , from what ?
the shrinking ozone ?
what , too little sunscreen ?
rudy , give me a break .
these are zombies pure and simple .
the sooner we accept it and deal with it ... the better chance we have of getting out of here alive .
your first mate seemed to know something about this island .
what was it ?
nothing but an old wives ' tale .
like the walking dead ?
well ... best i reckon , the story goes ... there was once some crazy spanish padre ... who was banished from spain ... hundreds of years ago .
his name was castillo sermano .
you asked to see me , father castillo ?
come closer , captain .
i cannot see your face .
are you afraid , captain ?
you know why i was banished from spain ?
your experiments are not of god .
god ?
what has god done for you , or for me ?
nothing .
there is no god .
there' s only me .
may he have mercy on your soul .
the spanish were trying from falling ... the sands into the limeys .
they never made it to the garrison .
they say he murdered the crew of the st. cristobol ... enslaved the natives of this island , and killed whoever came here ever since .
some say he still does .
i' m sorry i asked .
if you ask me ... it' s just a bunch of smugglers and cutthroats ...
looking for ways to scare people off .
well , you would know , wouldn' t you ?
what can i say ?
they' re doing a hell of a job , ain' t they ?
what is it ?
i can' t hear anything .
neither do i.
run !
run !
we can' t stay out here like this .
we' re too vulnerable .
i know , but we can' t leave until greg and casper get back .
we gotta get back on that boat , but there' s no way i' m goin ' in that water .
we can' t .
it' s too far .
besides , we don' t know what' s still on that boat .
what about that house ?
it' s defensible .
we' il have shelter .
okay , it' s a good idea .
we make a run for it as soon as they get back .
what if they don' t come back ?
what then ?
they' il come back .
yeah , but what if they don' t ?
what are we gonna do ?
we don' t have any weapons or food .
i mean , we don' t have shit .
actually , we do .
you gotta be kidding me .
this is why casper' s on your ass ?
you' re smuggling cuban cigars ?
among other things .
still hard at work smuggling , i see , victor .
don' t you just wish you could prove that , jordan ?
what are these then ?
we just found them on the beach .
right .
crazy , huh ?
i' m not gonna worry about that right now .
we' ve got bigger problems .
my patrol boat' s been destroyed .
my first mate is missing .
what about greg ?
where is he ?
yeah .
i don' t think he made it .
what do you mean ?
he' s gone .
i' m sorry .
we gotta go back there and look for him .
maybe there' s a chance he' s okay .
we can' t just leave him out there .
he' s dead .
if you don' t wanna end up like him , shut up and listen to what she' s saying .
what else you got in there besides smokes ?
anything useful ?
let me introduce you to my little friend .
and who said size doesn' t matter ?
nice .
but mine' s bigger .
mossberg 500 .
stainless shotgun with incendiary shells .
saving the best for last .
here you go .
take it .
good choice .
desert eagle .
i like the way you think , girl .
we can' t stay here for long .
those creatures are everywhere .
we talked about making a run for it to that house that we found .
that sounds like a good idea .
we can hole up in there until help arrives .
if help arrives .
don' t worry .
when we don' t report in , the marine patrol will come for us .
everyone know how to use their weapons ?
shit !
we' re gonna have to make a run for it .
what if they' re already inside ?
that' s a chance we have to take .
we can hold up a lot better in there than we can out here .
once they spot us ...
oh , god !
over here !
the door' s locked !
you gotta be kidding me !
we could blow the door .
but there won' t be enough left to keep them out .
forget it .
we' il find another way .
we need more ammo !
we haven' t got any .
i' m down to my last clip .
yeah , me too .
i' m saving mine for myself .
are you okay ?
watch out !
the window !
can you get through , rudy ?
yeah .
come on !
oh , shit .
die , you son of a bitch !
pull !
hurry !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
casper ?
look at me .
casper , look at me .
i need you to look at me .
okay ?
look at me .
look at me .
you saved us , okay ?
you saved us .
shit , i' m out !
fuck .
let' s get him to that table !
see if we can find something to use as a bandage .
simon , we should check for more of them .
sorry .
where' s casper , rudy ?
she didn' t make it .
i' m sorry .
okay .
okay , captain , this is gonna hurt .
do it .
do it !
are you ready ?
yeah .
give me a light .
here .
fuck .
oh , shit .
don' t look at me .
i' m the fuckin ' elephant man .
i think we should ...
just get away from me .
i don' t need your help .
hang in there , kirk .
all right , all right , all right .
just get some rest .
is he gonna end up like cynthia ?
i don' t know .
what do you think' s gonna happen to us ?
does it matter ?
it does .
it matters to me .
i mean , are we even gonna get out of here ?
even if we get out of here , i' m finished .
who' s gonna be able to look me in the eyes with a face like this ?
i' m a freak .
i belong in the fuckin ' circus .
don' t talk like that .
i happen to think you' ve been very brave tonight .
and i still think you' re pretty damn sexy .
you' re not just doing this to make me feel better , are you ?
i' m doing this to make me feel better .
it' s so quiet .
yeah , it' s almost too quiet .
look at this .
what ?
where are they dragging them ?
what are they doing with the bodies ?
i got a bad feeling .
what happened ?
rudy , what happened ?
why does it matter what happened ?
she' s dead .
i didn' t save her .
it' s not your fault .
it was my fault !
it was my fault !
were you here ?
did you see it ?
did you see ... watch them rip her apart ?
you know what ?
you know what ?
it' s not gonna happen again .
we' re gonna get out of here .
it' s kirk .
you need to take a look at him .
he' s getting worse .
okay .
how you doin ' , captain ?
i wouldn' t mind a drink .
okay .
that' s all we got .
not exactly what i had in mind , but thanks just the same .
guys , check out this book .
it looks pretty old .
maybe it' il help us .
well , that cuts it .
i' m either gonna get better or i ain' t .
in any case , you have no agua , a fistful of ammo left and zero rations .
maybe it' s time you stopped babysitting me ... and started worrying about yourselves a bit more .
what' d you have in mind ?
check out the rest of the house .
see what you can scrounge and where you can fortify yourselves better .
there' s no telling what' s coming through that door next .
maybe there' s another way out of here .
you guys , this looks like a ship' s journal .
according to the officer' s logs , it says castillo sermano killed the captain ... then beached the ship and lit it on fire .
so the stories that kirk told us make sense now .
you' d better go now .
go .
you' re right .
you gonna be okay ?
just fine .
if not , i' ve always got this .
the captain' s right .
we gotta get out of here and search the rest of this house .
let' s go .
let' s start with the courtyard .
what is all this ?
what' s in there ?
i can' t ...
it' s locked ?
what ...
oh , my god .
this is sick !
sorry .
this is unbelievable .
why aren' t these zombies alive ?
i don' t know .
rudy , take a look at this .
it' s blood .
it' s blood ?
yeah , but ... it' s not human , though .
it' s like it' s ...
it' s like it' s been mutated .
i' ve never seen anything like it before .
it' s completely unnatural .
it' s fucking genius .
i' m not gonna let salish live like one of them .
kirk , where are you ?
what are you doing ?
they' re gonna kill you .
i' m dead already .
see you in hell , boys .
everybody get down !
now !
get out of here !
