sequels .
it' s the only time i gave in in my life .
but sometimes , you gotta do it the studio way .
what are you talking about ?
get lost ?
yeah .
i thought the first one was pretty good .
get leo ?
terrific picture .
terrific !
and you know what else ?
it was good .
you know what i' m thinking , tommy ?
i' m thinking of getting out of the movie business .
go back to my old job .
what , being a shylock ?
yeah .
why ?
' cause at least they' re honest about being dishonest .
come on .
why would you wanna leave all this ?
hello !
see ?
i' m telling you , this town .
look , chil .
you and me , we come out to hollywood , sniff the air , and now look at us , man .
we made it !
and you know why ?
' cause we knew how to hustle a deal .
yeah , like i got hustled into doing the sequel .
that sucks .
do you know that unless you' re willing to use the r rating , you can only say the f word once ?
you' re kiddin ' me .
no .
you know what i say ?
fuck that .
i' m done .
before you skate out of the business ,
i got a movie for you .
oh , yeah ?
what ?
about ntl .
what' s ntl ?
what' s ntl ?
what , are you joking ?
no .
you' re pulling my chain .
nothing to lose records .
hello .
come on .
it' s , like , the indie label .
i sign bands , i produce their albums , i sell the distribution to the majors .
now you wanna make movies ?
yeah !
who doesn' t ?
all right , can you pitch it in 25 words or less ?
i can do it in one word ...
me !
you ?
me !
hello !
me !
i couldn' t get your mother to watch that movie .
my life in the music business .
come on !
gangsta rappers , the russian mafia , you know ?
all that goddamn payola crap .
this place is like the wild , wild west , man .
you' re dodgin ' the bullets , you' re taking the arrows .
and it' s got a girl .
there always is .
her name' s linda moon .
she plays a girl who wants to make it big in the biz , and i am the record mogul who makes it happen .
anyway , it' s a musical , and linda' s been trying to get me on the two way ever since , you know , she saw you on charlie rose , where you were very smooth , and found out that i knew you .
i said you would help her out , and she left you on the list at the viper room expecting you to show up .
so , tommy , how' s your wife ?
edie ?
yeah .
who gives a shit ?
don' t be a buzzkill .
where are you goin ' ?
i gotta go to the men' s .
i just had two iced teas .
but how about ...
hey , chili , how does the movie sound ?
well , you don' t have a movie yet .
you' ve got a premise and a setting , but you don' t have character arcs or a plot .
okay , but still .
you know .
hey , who' s gonna play me ?
think about that .
how about carrot top ?
do svidaniya .
hey , marla .
long time no see .
yeah .
how' s organized crime treatin ' ya ?
a little more exciting now that you' re in town .
oh , yeah ?
so , mr. palmer , we' ve got reason to believe that this was a mob hit .
trust me , if this were a mob hit , they' d have hired a man who knew how to shoot .
he hit him in the chest .
finally .
after he shot up my caddy .
what a shame .
can you confirm that this fella was wearing a toupee ?
stevie wonder could confirm that he was wearing a toupee .
so out of the blue , this mr. athens just decides to look up your number and give you a call ?
i know what you' re gettin ' at , marla .
you think i set him up .
the truth is tommy wanted me to do a movie about him .
but you can' t do a movie where the main character gets popped in the first scene , now , can you ?
yeah .
it' s not a bad opening .
you know , you' re right .
that worked for american beauty .
sunset boulevard .
or casino .
mr. palmer .
i' m glenn from thrifty executive fleet .
may i escort you to your vehicle ?
but of course .
marla .
detective .
there you go , sir .
what' s that ?
i asked for a cadillac .
the insight is the cadillac of gas electric hybrid cars .
not only is it fuel efficient , it' s great for the environment .
i got it .
thanks .

but he' s like six feet something .
that' s okay .
you don' t ...
you know , low angles .
you know , the movies ?
hey , chili , is that your car ?
yeah , it' s an insight .
it' s the cadillac of hybrids .
it' s a little tight for a big guy like you .
small price to pay for the environment .
fifty seven miles to the gallon .
but what about speed ?
no , martin .
if you' re important , people will wait .
just one shot , marty .
marty , one smile for me , come on .
my love , yeah
you' ve got the best of my love
demonstrated love and affection
that you give so openly , yeah

you have to let it go halfway .
you can' t be always tryin ' so damn hard .
linda .

raji , no , i ...

it' s an absolute pleasure to meet you .
thank you .
please , have a seat .
can i get you something to drink ?
i have something coming .
so , tommy' s gone ?
yeah .
i can' t believe it .
i guess this means you' re not doing the movie ?
well , i gotta be honest with you , linda .
i' m getting out of the movie business .
here you go .
what' s the matter ?
i' m tired of this , mr. palmer .
look , if i can get some cash ,
i would buy my way out of my contract and get out of music .
are you kidding ?
after what i just saw ?
why would you do that ?
' cause it sucks .
look , i could do the same thing topless and make $2, 000 a week with tips .
well , why don' t you do that ?
i' m baptist .
my father wouldn' t approve .
so then you' re like aretha franklin .
you learned to sing in church .
i learned from my father .
my dad was in a jazz band .
nothing big , though .
see , everything i know about music i learned from him .
i always thought we' d play together , but then ... ... then he died , so ...
yo , linda !
yo !
i didn' t dismiss you .
you' re on my time .
that' s my manager raji with miss bangkok .
i told him i want to quit and he' s , like , " you quit me , girl , i' m gonna jack you up " .
he talks like that ?
he thinks he' s black .
his real name is roger lowenthal .
he' s partners with this guy named nick carr .
he' s this music promoter ?
i know nicky .
they caught me straight off the bus from texas .
said they' d make me this big star and like a fool , i believed ' em .
when you done turnin ' tricks , get your ass back over here !
i ain' t done with you yet !
look , i can' t do five more years .
not with these guys .
who' s the big guy ?
that' s elliot wilhelm , raji' s bodyguard .
he' s got this thing that he can raise one eyebrow , give you that look .
he wants to be in movies .
what , that' s it ?
he just does the one eyebrow ?
as far as i know , he' s gay , too .
word is he once threw a guy out of a 30 story building for calling him a fag .
well , he must' ve been mad .
maybe if you didn' t blow all your energy bangin ' tourists , your voice wouldn' t sound so flat .
talkin ' about a flat voice , you know what i' m sayin ' ?
yeah , that one was for me , so you just relax .
you' re gonna end up doing fifty cent lap dances at the first king
like miss bangkok .
chil , wait .
you don' t know these guys .
they' re bad guys .
trust me , linda , i know ' em a whole lot better than you do . ... doin ' some ass poppin ' all up and down a pole .
you' d be up in that place goin ' pop , pop , pop .
pop , pop , pop .
what are you gonna say ?
nothing more than i have to , if that .
ass poppin ' .
snap , crackle , pop !
chili , wait .
man in the suit .
you in town for some kind of convention ?
no , but if i was , you' d be the man to see , am i right ?
why would you say somethin ' stupid like that ?
the way you' re dressed , you' re either a pimp or a limo driver .
we' ve got jokes ?
you some kind of weak ass comedian ?
raji , look at me .
i' m lookin ' at you , man .
you say you' re looking at me , but are you really looking at me ?
i' m really lookin ' at you .
you got somethin ' stupid to say ?
say it , so i can be done with you .
linda' s quit .
she' s out of the chicks .
man , miss me with that .
she' s got five years left on her contract .
well , i just cancelled it .

you know .
you were right there when it happened , weren' t you ?
well , i was in the men' s .
but you were with him in his last hour , right ?
i ...
i' ve had him cremated , and i wanted to do something special with his ashes , you know .
maybe something he' d like .
do you got any ideas ?
well , nothing that makes sense .
say , edie , is that an aerosmith tattoo on your back ?
yeah .
you know i followed them on tour , right ?
i didn' t know that .
i thought joe perry was so hot .
yeah ?
so you were a groupie ?
no , man , much worse .
i did their laundry .
they travel with their own washer and dryer .
i did everything except steven' s stage clothes .
you know , he likes to send those out .
so , edie , i was thinking , you know , maybe i could help you out with ntl records .
what makes you think i need your help ?
nothin ' .
look , chili ...
let me tell you somethin ' .
i started ntl with tommy .
right .
equal partners .
yeah .
and who do you think found the dub md' s ?
i did .
tommy' s gone .
and i' m devastated , but i' m not about to roll over .
i can run my own label .
if anybody could , it' s you .
hey , edie .
why don' t you get your clothes on and let' s get outta here , okay ?
make you feel better .
besides , i wanna talk to you about this girl linda moon .
linda moon ?
yeah .
she' s a singer .
here , put this on .
you know , i never made it with any of those guys from aerosmith .
yeah ?
i played tennis with tom hamilton once , though .
christ .
i was just a girl then .
you' il always be a girl .
chil , thank you .
who' s this ?
that' s tiffany , tommy' s intern .
how ya doing ?
what' s that ?
pizza .
he means the urn , genius .
tommy .
you know , the cops came by ntl last night .
they were asking me about you .
yeah ?
what' d you say ?
nothing .
just that you were gonna make a movie about tommy .
it' d have to be a short .
they take anything ?
some boxes , a few files .
but i think what they were lookin ' for was this .
thanks .
here .
where' d you get this ?
some guy with a russian accent .
it' s ntl .
you know , about a month ago , he starts coming by ,
lookin ' for tommy .
tommy' s in the office , what , like three hours a week ?
so , this last time , he takes a picture .
he comes in , doesn' t even ask for tommy ,
lights it on fire , and just tosses it on my desk .
no questions , no nothing .
two days later , he comes back and this time , tommy' s in .
so i interrupt his meeting , and i buzz him .
he comes flying out of his office , walks up to the guy , nails him right in the eye .
just like that scene in get leo .
then he tosses the guy on his ass right in the middle of the street .
i' m like , " tommy , who the hell was that ?
insurance salesman .
okay .
an insurance salesman .
insurance scam .
i mean , geez , even i know that .
guy takes a picture of your business , says either you pay up or he puts your place on fire .
well , you know , edie , that was tommy' s specialty in brooklyn .
he sold protection .
he could write a book on the different ways to work it .
did this guy have a toupee ?
not after tommy hit him .
good morning .
carosell entertainment .
you see the chicks international ?
i think these girls are gonna be big , the next big act to break .

marty , hold on a sec , will you ?
what do you want , raj ?
it says in the paper that chili palmer used to be a gangster .
he was a hired hand .
you know him ?
tell me what you want , raj .
linda moon says she' s gonna leave and have chili palmer be her manager .
she told you that ?
no , man , he told me that .
what' d you do ?
i told him she' s got five years on her contract , you know .
you feel you had to explain it to him ?
you didn' t kick his ass ?
man , he hit elliot right in the damn throat .
he broke him smooth down .
wow .
what a surprise .
elliot' s a faggot .
pussy .
you think it' s cool to have a queer for a bodyguard ?
what good is he ?
chili palmer' s no manager .
he' s a talker .
you shoulda hit him in the mouth .
what he does is make movies about shylocks , ' cause that' s all he was .
a shylock .
that' s right .
he did that movie get lost .
that' s my shit , man .
that shit was tight .
there is no way we are losing linda moon .

you' re gonna love her .
sounds like you love her .
well , if you' re asking me if i think she' s talented , yes .
i can' t believe this .
condolences on a two way and half of them are tommy' s ex girlfriends .
look , chil , producing an album , you know , it' s not like making a movie .
good .
i think movies are too corporate .
i like to be spontaneous and creative .
i' m just saying , you know , the music biz is a bitch , you know ?
it' s dangerous .
it' s rough out there .
believe me , i know .
that' s why i loved working at momo' s club , if you know what i mean .
what' d you do at momo' s ?
you book bands ?
not really .
were you a bouncer ?
not really .
you really were a shylock , weren' t you ?
did i tell you that she writes her own music ?
here she is .
here we go .
you ready to show off ?
chili , look , i' m so sorry , but my damn replacement didn' t show up .
i ended up stuck in the drive through .
it' s all right .
calm down , calm down .
edie , linda .
linda , this is edie athens .
this is tommy' s widow .
hi .
nice to meet you .
look , i' m really sorry about being late .
don' t worry about it .
so chili tells me you' ve got a great voice .
really ?
well , you do .
that is so sweet .
thank you .
is this where you play ?
i can' t really afford my own piano , so they let me play here .
come on , let' s go hear you .
yeah ?
let' s go .
life is what you make it
at least that' s what they say
well , i think i' m gonna make it
fulfill my dreams someday
i feel this fire growing
deep inside of me
i' m so inspired knowing that it' s my destiny
i breathe like a champion
i dream like a champion
i see i' m a champion
it' s meant to be
my will' s getting stronger
i can' t wait any longer
i' m singing a song that' s inside of me
' cause i' m a believer
i know that i can make it no matter what they say
' cause i' m a believer
the future is now
it starts today
i' m impressed .
did you write that song ?
yeah .
it' s called i' m a believer .
just tell us you got nine more just like it .
forty more .
but as long as i can do ' em my way .
i like that .
let' s get you in the studio .
all right .
good girl .
you weren' t kidding .
i mean , the girl' s got something .
she' s amazing .
i told you .
i mean , the only thing is , you know , it costs a lot of money to break someone , you know ?
i mean , we gotta pay a mixer , a publicist .
hey , look .
steven tyler' s in town .
yeah .
aerosmith playing at the staples center .
tell me dream on is not the greatest rock ' n ' roll song you ever heard .
you know what we oughta do , we oughta call him .
call who ?
steven .
why ?
so he could listen to linda' s music , he could see for himself it' s terrific , and maybe he' il help us launch her at his concert .
that' s a great idea , chil .
yeah .
hey , and maybe bono and sting' il come down and we could all cut a christmas album .
you know him , don' t you ?
know him ?
steven tyler .
chili , i know his socks !
he' s never gonna remember me .
edie , you have a tattoo of aerosmith on your ass .
you can' t get a meeting with him ?
we want steven tyler , we get steven tyler .
i would let the music do the talking to me to tell me what lyrics to sing .
and even when i got caught up in not having anything pre written , which i never did , i would scat to it .
it' s just the music , it' s the funk .
it' s the sound , it' s the words , it' s the rhyme , it' s the shit .
you can' t be creative unless you step outside a little bit .
it' s ...
a little early , aren' t you ?
open house is on sunday .
yeah .
hey , it' s chili palmer .
yo , chil .
how soon can you get here ?
2 : 00 a. m. and there' s traffic on the 405 .
who' s your friend ?
i don' t know .
i come home and he' s bleeding all over my one sheet .
is this the guy that did tommy athens ?
nah .
that guy had a black eye and was wearing a rug .
this ain' t no rug , pal .
this guy' s got plugs .
i hate plugs .
it looks like doll' s hair .
personally , i think grafting' s the only way to go .
the look' s more natural .
that' s , of course , ' cause they use your own hair .
very interesting .
now are you gonna help me out with him ?
is that why you called me here ?
yeah .
you' re a big guy .
i don' t want to do it alone .
come on , up .
get this wallet outta here before the cops come .
all right , set him down .
here we go .
ivan surva ...
he' s russian .
been here for five months .
the guy that killed tommy , he saw you , right ?
yeah .
so you could i. d. him .
then he sees your picture in the paper , then he sends doll hair guy here to take you out .
so while he was waiting for me , he got depressed and shot himself in the back ?
good point .
who are all these people trying to kill you ?
i don' t know .
but i' m in the music business now .
it could be anybody .
mugambo , my brother , you check out the chicks ?
i told you , bro .
this linda moon ... she' s a belter .
mugambo , i gotta jump .
love you , bro .
get me raji on the phone .
what' s up ?
it' s raji .
hey , lowenthal .
joe loops was supposed to kill chili palmer .
instead , he killed some goddamn russian .
for real ?
you two better work this shit out or your ass is next .
stupid ass .
i gotta tell you the truth .
i never seen a hit like this before .
i mean , you actually gotta get in line to whack this guy .
how many men have you whacked , joe ?
why , you wanna be next ?
i' m asking you because you hit the wrong guy .
they serve one hell of a stuffed cabbage here , you know that ?
the thing that you wanna remember though is don' t eat it too late because it tends to stay with you .
yeah .
i' il definitely keep that in mind .
where we at , joe ?
we ain' t nowhere .
i now gotta go find the right guy .
the thing is it' il cost you another five grand .
what are you talkin ' about ?
man , i already paid you .
you' re the one who did the wrong guy .
well , whose fault is that ?
it' s your fault .
tough shit .
that' s the cost of doing business .
look , you tell nicky that there' s now a new contract , and i need another five grand .
i can talk the deal with you , ' cause it' s my contract , all right ?
that' s why i' m here with you .
you can' t talk shit .
you' re nicky' s girl .
me and nick are partners .
we discuss all facets of the business together .
be it music , be it underworld , girls .
let me ask you a question .
nice get up you got .
how come he calls you his bitch ?
what ?
his bitch .
why does he call you his bitch ?
what , mother ... ? !
did i stutter ?
what if i called you a fat , stupid guinea bee yatch ?
bee yatch !
i' d take this baseball bat that i got out in the back of my cadillac , and i' d swat you across the mouth with it .
i said what if i called you that .
hypothetically , just a scenario .
i wasn' t actually saying it to you .
i' m always lookin ' out .
i gotta operate .
i wanna make sure i got the right guy .
now i need the right guy to get the right guy .
now i want the five grand up front .
tonight at the mayan .
what ?
the what ?
take the wax outta your goddamn ears .

i never happen to have heard of the mayan , so i was making sure i knew where it was .

that' s weapons of mass destruction .
i know who they are .

larry , i' il call you back .
i heard sean penn lives up here .

how' d you get in here ?
your maid left the back door open .
i don' t have a maid .
i can tell .
come on .
get out of here before i have to shoot you .
nah , nicky , sit down and stop being such a hard on .
so , mr. red hot chili pepper .
i heard you were at the viper room .
so raji told you about linda moon .
she' s something else , huh ?
the heart and soul of that group .
i' m telling you , bro , the chicks are gonna be big .
how' s that ?
by singing songs from the ' 70s ?
don' t laugh .
you see , you' re a movie guy , so you don' t know , but the music biz , it goes in cycles .
it' s like linda .
when i signed her , girl power was dead .
it was the era of the singer songwriter .
but now the market' s flooded .
what do the labels want ?
girl groups .
nicky , look at me .
i am .
i want linda' s contract .
if you want to produce linda' s album , great .
i' m sure you can even get a buck a record .
but i got her booked into some major gigs , bro .
and i' m two seconds away from getting her a deal .
you mean you' ve had linda for two years and you' ve never gotten her a record deal ?
chili , a trio is not born overnight .
i' ve had her for three days , and i already got her a label .
so it looks like we don' t need you , nicky .
let' s get something straight .
this isn' t the movies .
you can' t tell everyone you' re a wise guy and charm their pants off .
this is the music business .
we' re all wise guys .
all right , wise guy , i' il make you a deal .
carosell , which is the dumbest name i' ve ever heard for a company , gives me linda moon' s contract , and if you ever threaten her in any way , you' il regret it for as long as you live , if that .
that' s some deal .
what' s in it for me ?
i' il just make believe that that dead russian that i found in my house had nothing to do with you .
you don' t know what you' re doing , chil .
what makes you even think linda could make it on her own ?
she' s got me .
he' s gonna cry till i tell him that i' il never roam
so , chattanooga choo choo , won' t you choo choo me home ?
so , you' re like a rapper now ?
sniff doggy doo doo .
you clownin ' my gear again ?
you know you like this , joe .
come on , joe !
you know my style makes the ladies smile .
they just started chattanooga choo choo .
i love that song .
i can' t believe they did that .
damn , man .
i wish i coulda heard that .
i like a good choo choo song .
look , do you want your money or what , my man ?
first off , i ain' t your man , you asshole .
you remember my driver elliot .
elliot , give this man the envelope .
ain' t you gonna count it ?
nick ain' t got the balls to stiff me .
i like that idea you had about having a bat in the car .
i had my man elliot go out and get one .
a red bat !
you don' t send a queer to get a bat .
they like these shiny queer things .
what you want ...
it' s not your fault ...
what you want is a wood bat .
see , like a louisville slugger .
let me see .
hold this for me , please .
thank you .
you see , a bat like this , it messes up a kid' s swing .
you gotta take too long of a swipe across the plate , you see ?
he never develops those fast hands you' re gonna need for the majors , you understand ?
i don' t know how fast it' s gotta be for my needs , you know what i' m sayin ' to you ?
i ain' t gonna be up in no majors ...
you like that one , huh ?
here' s your sandwich .
what' s up ?
raji , i think he' s chokin ' .
you clownin ' me ?
joe , are you clownin ' with me ?
you don' t ever disrespect me !
one !
raji , raji , raji .
damn .
he' s dead .
man !
talk all that shit , man .
this right here , this was the cost of doin ' ... business !
all i want is some appreciation , elliot .
chili palmer don' t realize how hard i work for linda moon .
i tried to make her a superstar !
what do i expect in return ?
what do i expect in return ?
my name on the damn cd so small you can barely read the damn thing !
and where' s that at ?
where' s that always at ?
on the back , at the bottom .
produced by raji " .
in tiny little letters , man !
and i will not let him take that from me !
now it' s time i got some respect !
i will straight smoke chili palmer !
i didn' t take you for a black eyed peas fan .
well , when they hooked up with sergio mendes , they won me over .
do you ever think about becoming a singer ?
a singer ?
yeah .
me ?
nah .
but i was a real live vegas showgirl once .
really ?
yeah .
as soon as i was done washing clothes , i got lucky .
one of those tropicana revues , you know ?
thanks .
chili , i worked so hard starting ntl .
i' m a bit too old to go back to vegas .
i want you to stop worrying .
we' re gonna meet steven tyler .
you know , i would' ve liked to seen you dance .
yeah ?
well , you still can .
yeah ?
how' s that ?
do you dance , chili ?
me ?
i' m from brooklyn .
okay , so we walk in the staples center with linda' s cd .
right .
and then what ?
we put a gun to steven' s head and say , " linda' s playing with aerosmith " .
you really like the music business , don' t you , chil ?
love it .
me , too .
tommy and me , we had a few records on the air , but i' d just like one time to turn on the radio and say , " that' s my song .
i produced that " .
somethin ' , somethin ' with soul .
you know ?
your hair' s different , huh ?
yeah .
i had it trimmed .
good night , chili .
all right .
drive safe .
that' s the pawn shop my friend from the oc told me about .
it' s surrounded by the feds .
they' re watching these russians .
there he is .
oh , yeah .
his name' s roman bulkin .

i wouldn' t do that if i were you .
there' s half a dozen undercover cops outside .
