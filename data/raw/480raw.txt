being a policeman is not what you see on tv .
i' ve never had to pick between the red and blue wires .
never seen a police car flip and cause other cars to burst into flames .
never had to jump across rooftops .
i investigate crimes , track leads ... ... and sit in court .
it' s difficult , tedious work , and you won' t get rich .
but i' ve done it for 28 years .
i' m a detective .
that' s what i do .
if you break the law ... ... l' il do all i can to hunt you down and put you behind bars .
i won' t say that i succeed every time .
but i try to make sure that if you do the crime , you' il do time .
any questions ?
well , detective preston , why don' t you tell us about ... ... the lighter side of police work ?
you know .
the fun days .
i chased him over three roofs .
you can' t do this !
it' s from the mayor .
you' re a loose cannon .
you destroyed a city block !
he fired first .
i should read him his rights ?
you should' ve called for backup .
my only backup is in a hospital bed !
his doctor called five minutes ago .
jimmy didn' t make it .
oh , god .
oh , god , no .
no !
he was talking about getting out .
it' s hard .
he was like a brother to me , captain .
since we was kids , we was partners .
we used to hang out ... ... and dream about being on the force together .
that was the dream .
just two little irish boys ... ... fighting , scrapping , thinking about making a difference .
god , i' m gonna miss him !
i' il need your gun and your shield , pete .
i may be off the force , but i am not off this case !
that' s not in the script .
i just threw that in at the end .
i thought i should get the last line .
nailed it !

he' s dirty harry , he' s real and we' ve got him by the balls .
i see where you' re going with this .
a reality show .
how is it different than " cops " ?
did you see ?
he' s a modern day cowboy .
he' s sexy , volatile .
he' s a bad boy , and women love bad boys .
he could frisk me .
you like getting frisked ?
brad , focus .

okay , brad .

we' re with him 24 hours a day .
because he' s gonna blow again , and when he does , we' il be there .
if he makes a lot of arrests , he gets a prize ?
who gets the prize ?
this isn' t a game show .
this is one man , on his own , kicking ass and taking names .
can we give him a partner ?
that' s a good idea .
we' il give him a funny minority type .
that' il get the naacp off my back .
or is it the ncaa ?
do we have a deal ?
fine , go make a pilot .
no , brad .
this guy isn' t a pilot , he' s a series .
trust me .
i' il stake my entire reputation on it .
what reputation ?
you still get shit for faking the flammable pajama story .
you can' t tell me that wasn' t good tv .
are you in or out ?
i' m pitching this at fox in half an hour .
i' il give a six episode commitment .
yes !
but if it' s all pit stops at krispy kreme , i' m pulling the plug ...
... and you' re out of a job .
we' il all be out of a job .
what do they teach you in china ?
let' s go .

and find a cameraman .
ls julio out of traction ?
i' il call the hospital .
what if our dirty harry says no ?
everybody wants to be on tv .

it looks like the stolen cuffs were an inside job .
that' s very funny , guys .
very funny .
very well written .
what are you reading , the jenny craig newsletter ?
fyl , my friend , a lot of this is muscle .
it' s a flyer for some new reality tv cop show .
i got to be part of this .
thought you wanted to be a detective .
i' m a cop and i' m a professional actor .
your career consists of a few lines on an episode of " diagnosis murder .
all i need is the right part and i' il get my big break .
know how old sam jackson was when he got his break ?
he was 42 .
okay , but he' s got , gosh , what' s that thing called ?
talent .
i' m talented .
i ain' t no sam jackson , but i' m talented .
your partner will be mitch preston .
we know who' d wear the cuffs there .
he nailed the other lead ?
he' s front page news .
everybody' s talking about him .
i' d blow his old ass off the screen every night .

i said , " do you wanna take your feet off the desk ?
get your feet off the desk .
where' s lazy boy ?
my client' s taking the fifth .
he' s the victim here .

that' s privileged information .
the captain needs to see you when you' re done .
he' s done .
come on , rerun .
this interview is over .
we don' t talk , we walk .
for now .
do you want me to start filming ?
yeah , everything you see .

oh , my god .
this place is so depressing .
it looks like a tomb .
well , you wanted reality .
we need a reality change .
this is hideous .
i' m not doing it .
let them follow somebody else .
they don' t want anyone else .
you the man of the hour .
all i did was shoot a video camera .
you made us look like savages .
the network is suing for $10 million .
what ?
they said you could have killed their cameraman .
maybe i should have killed him .
the chief already cut the deal .
do the show , and they drop the suit .
what ?
that' s extortion !
they can' t do that .
we need good pr .
community relations are in the toilet .
you the best detective we got .
so , what about this big gun ?
am i supposed to let them follow me around while i track down the weapon ?
look , i did an episode of " cops " once .
you did an episode of " cops " ?
you forget the camera is even there .
this is real work .
i' m not an actor .
no one is saying you can' t work .
but you screwed up .
and now you' ve got to play ball .
end of story .
you' il be reporting to the show' s producer , chase renzi .
chase renzi ?
is that a real name ?
i won' t take orders from some coked out hollywood dickhead .
not in a million years .
that i won' t do .
that' s good , because she doesn' t have a dick .
check her out for yourself .
she' s outside , waiting for you .
well .
better looking than i thought .
we gotta bring in color , some light .
do you think these windows move ?
detective preston , hi .
i can see you' re busy .
we' il talk tomorrow .
he' s not very friendly .

so , detective preston ....
can i call you mitch ?
why don' t i just launch into a few basic questions ...
... and find out what makes you tick .
i don' t tick .
sure you do .
everybody ticks .
not me .
tell me about yourself .
you have a girlfriend , a wife ?
ex wife .
ex wife .
was it a painful divorce ?
i only ask because i was divorced , and i know it can be difficult .
i mean , did you drink ?
lady , i' m here because my captain made me .
i had no choice .
i have no interest in you , your questions or your show .
not only do i understand your resistance , i appreciate it .
you do , huh ?
good .
i' m not into making the same bullshit cop show we' ve seen a million times .
that' s why i believe if we' re honest and open with each other ... ... we could do something very special here .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
i' m talking about reality , mitch .
there you go .
letting the world find out who you really are .
you' re looking for loose cannon , cop on the edge " serpico " bullshit .
i' m telling you , you' re wasting your time .
see that anger , mitch ?
it' s working for you .
the audience will connect with that in a major way .
i' m out of here .
i' il call you later to discuss your new partner .
want that in a doggy bag ?
no .
thanks , though .
it was delicious .
how did it go ?
is he intense ?
i need cherry tums , quick .
ls he psyched about the show ?
it may be harder than i thought .
hey !
you son of a bitch !
freeze !
l. a. p. d. !
wait !
wait !
bad idea .
i only got two things bigger than my mouth .
one of them is pointed at your head .
you want to do this the hard way ?
i' il stick you , pig !
okay , officer .

you damn right .
if your boys want to know who put the smack down on you , my badge is 38723 .
i go by the name of trey sellars , patrolman .
i believe this belongs to you , ma' am .
chase renzi .
that was incredible .
just doing my job , like the badge says , protecting and serving .
get this psycho off me !
what' s with the superfly shit ?
i got the situation in hand .
top cop , how you doing ?
this is my collar .
never leave a suspect who' s not cuffed .
he could' ve had a gun .
nobody got no gun .
trey , i think you broke a rib .
tell him to get the cuffs off .
i told you i can' t do handcuffs .
quiet !
you have the right to remain silent !
you know each other ?
no .
never seen him before .
just another criminal .
bullshit .
we took a stage combat class together last fall .
nice try , pal .
he' s just trying to weasel his way out of the crime .
that' s what he' s doing .
he looks like a real menace .
who wants to explain ?
trey said he' d give me $50 if i snatched the lady' s purse and ran .
he' d pull up in his police car , jump out ... ... chase me up a fence , beat me down , kick me
all right , all right .
okay .
i set the whole thing up .
it was a big setup .
i set it up to make it look like i was ....
i was auditioning to get this part .
what part ?
your partner .
we' ve been interviewing .
it won' t be this moron .
i should report you for impersonating a cop .
put a lock on that " moron " shit .
why you take everything so seriously ?
you should be protecting , not staging crimes .
someone could' ve got hurt .
like me .
i' m learning from a guy who shot a news camera ?
you got the part already .
i' m just trying to spruce it up .
that' s what you normally do at work .
better watch your mouth .
what are you gonna do , wrap me up in caution tape ?
no , i ain' t gonna wrap you up in caution tape .
but i' il tell you , punk , i might whip your ass up and down the parking lot .
work on your " starsky and hutch " routine on your own time .
you better walk off .
i was getting ready to slap you .
he' s a disgrace .
you' d work with him ?
never in a million years .
i think we have good chemistry .
riveting .
amazing .

thank you .

the guy' s a joke .
there' s no way i' il work with him .
i don' t want to hear it .
shit , come on .

that' s an order .
trapped in the jaws , he struggled .

the doors fly open .
they fly open .
you burst in .
you scan the room .
you do the turn , toss yourself around .
and now !
you' re set and
but don' t turn your head too far from camera .
that little lady is your lover .
don' t respect her , she won' t respect you .
always know where she is .
she' s in my way .
what' s wrong ?
you' re getting tips from t. j. hooker .
which is the most underrated show in history .
nobody came through a door like you .
thank you .
this guy is no detective .
i' m playing a detective .
i' m playing detective .
all right , guys .
i' m playing a detective .
okay .
let' s go do some hood jumping .
what' s that ?
what do you think ?
we jump over hoods .
something you' d know .
freeze !
that was great , trey .
beautiful .
that was really great .
okay , mitch .
come here .
i' m not going on the hood of a car .
what do you mean ?
forget it .
i entertained viewers everywhere in the ' 80s , jumping on car hoods .
one of a tv cop' s greatest weapons .
i' il show you .
you gotta stop them , see ?
halt !
and you throw your body .
halt !
you okay , t. j. ?
moving on .
who stole the money ?
deep in thought .
now the eyebrows arch , ever so slightly .
and hooker solves another case .
okay ?
all right , trey , you try it .
go ahead .
ready ?
get loose now .
loosen up .
ready ?
yeah .
trey , who stole the money ?
good .
you nailed it , first take .
give me five .
that was good !
okay , mitch .
come on , show me some magic .
mitch , who stole the money ?
look at that , trey .
look .
look at the anger in his eyes .
look at that .
see that slight squint says , " hey , i' m mitch .
i' m the man .
don' t mess with me .
okay .
let' s taste some drugs .
hooker' s got a bag of white powder in his hand .
spears it open with a pocketknife .
takes his little pinkie ... ... in the powder .
and he touches it , gently , on his tongue .
watch the eyebrows .
hooker knows it' s cocaine .
what if it' s cyanide ?
hello ?
hold on .
there' s a reason real cops don' t taste drugs , bill .
it' s never cyanide .
show me the thing with your eyebrow .
okay , i' m on my way .
it' s tricky .
where are you going ?
i gotta wash this shit out of my hair .
we have some action ?
we have some action , finally .
beep , beep !
hey , mitch .
what' d you do to my car ?
we added micro cameras .
in the wheel , the glove compartment and a crook cam in the back .
pretend they' re not there .
pretend .
see ?
you' re catching on already .
we' il be right behind you in the van .
you' il be right behind me ?
what are you doing ?
i' m on the case .
i' m your partner .
we' re together .
unbelievable .
what' s the mean face for ?
listen .
don' t speak , listen .
there' s a few things i need to tell you .
first of all , you gotta know that i got your back covered ... ... and i gotta know you got mine covered .
no doubt .
when we' re on the job you' re the only person i can depend on .
not friends , family , not anybody , just you .
you got that ?
that' s important .
there' s no other way .
and it' s gotta start right now .
you know , ever since i was 8 , i wanted to be a cop .
i wanted to be on the force like uncle reggie .
he was the first in the family on the force .
big muscles .
uncle reggie .
he used to let me ride in the squad car with him .
once he let me play with the siren .
from then on ... ... i knew i was gonna be a cop .
uncle reggie .
yeah .
my uncle
uncle reggie passed away two years ago .
he got caught in the line of some fire .
didn' t slow me down .
i remember how he set me on my way .
he' s looking down on me from a big precinct in the sky .
he' s thinking , " you' ve done all right , trey .
you' ve done right by me .
what does that got to do with anything ?
you got a speech , so i get a speech .
that wasn' t a speech .
that " i' m your partner .
that was a speech .
you burned up 90 seconds of air .
that was a speech .
when we get to the crime scene , stay out of my way .
this isn' t studio shit .
this is real .
get your camera out of here .
hey , watch it .
julio has to shoot .
that' s the show .
he' s done " jerry springer .
that' s right .
whatever you need , i' m there .
if i get shot , stabbed , it' s cool .
whatever .
i' m getting good footage .
go to trey .
i' m trey .
julio .
you worked on springer ?
springer , girls gone wild .
get that camera out of here .
who' s in the bag ?
we don' t know yet .
whoever shot him didn' t care for open caskets .
thinking what i' m thinking ?
i seriously doubt it .
i' m thinking there' s dirty cops on the streets ... ... cleaning the streets up on they own terms , partner .
this is payback for a drug deal gone sour .
whoever this guy worked for got pissed .
even better .
this is a bad guy retribution scenario .
good thinking , partner .
good thinking .
i think i can identify one of the victims .
those are 12 gauge , armor piercing uranium shells .
charlie .
hey , mitchell .
i found explosive and incendiary rounds scattered around .
the same gun that put holes in your tv repair shop .
it appears to be hand held , automatic , with interchangeable magazines .
technically , this gun doesn' t exist .
what do you mean ?
this gun is like the 50 foot shark .
speak english .
it' s out there , but nobody' s ever seen it .
any idea who made it ?
it' s a custom job .
my guess is , it' s out of eastern europe .
thanks , charlie .
keep your eyes open .
you bet .
what are you doing ?
take it easy .
you' re not supposed to touch .
i didn' t .
i turned it over .
let me know when you touch  i don' t have to
what' s going on ?
he' s contaminating my crime scene .
i' m doing a sweep of the area .
you never know where a crucial bit of evidence may be hiding .
like this , for instance .
did anybody think to pull some prints off this water bottle ?
can i get an evidence bag ?
put down my water .
i' m not finished drinking it .
that' s an honest mistake .
you got your water amongst potential evidence so i thought it was ....
hey , t. j. , go solve the case somewhere else .
don' t give me orders , i' m your partner !
no , you' re not , i partner with real cops .
get me a copy of that report .
all right , mitch .
well , i am your partner , so you better accept that .
i am your partner !
he won' t open up .
you know how hard it is to work with somebody like that ?
i know .
mitch has been a lot more resistant than i' d hoped for .
i think that you and mitch need some bonding time .
you' re right .
we do .
we need some qt time together .
two guys hanging out , have some beers .
i' il call to see if he wants to hang out .
let' s not call him .
let' s just go over .
just show up ?
surprise him .
what are you doing ?
how hard is it to say , " hi , trey , nice to see you " ?
hi , trey .
what are you doing here ?
we got off on the wrong foot .
i got some food .
we can eat the food and bond a bit .
bond ?
yeah .
how' d you get my address ?
hi , mitch .
oh , shit .
yeah .
i gave it to him .
will you invite us in ?
don' t be rude .
do i have to ?
you got us out in the hall like a jehovah' s witness .
i gotta see where my star cop lives .
come on , mitch .
oh , my god .
mitch ... !
nice .
got a little smell to it .
not a stinky smell , an odd one .
what is that smell ?
is this here your actual living area ?
this is my batcave .
a tunnel in the garage leads to my mansion .
what' s the problem ?
research tells us buddy cops live in visually distinctive places .
like a trailer on the beach or a loft downtown .
that kind of thing .
your research shows that , huh ?
where does he live ?
i rent a guesthouse from a producer .
kind of gives off a " magnum " vibe .
totally .
it' s unique .
you know what , mitch ?
we can make this work .
did a crackhead make this cup ?
it' s not visually exciting enough ?
no .
it' s just
the point is to let the audience in on all aspects of your life .
they want to spend time in a place that speaks to your personality .
this does speak to my personality .
mitch , i think you need some time away from the job .
i just found the crackhead' s shop .
hey , don' t go in there .
this is what you smell all over the place .
wow , a pottery studio !
you' re full of surprises .
how long you been doing this ?
six years , give or take .
you really got a knack for it .
this room' s off limits .
it' s not for show .
okay , mitch .
we haven' t done any bonding at all yet .
bond with yourself , i got work to do .
hey !
check this out .
must be some hollywood dickhead .
not bad , huh ?
a cop never slides across the hood .

this is good .
you have to see it .
mitch , you have to see this .
look at your desk .
it' s so beautiful .
ls this my desk ?
that' s your desk .
and that' s yours , mitch .
we didn' t change it .
but this is a confessional .
all right ?
talk about anything you want .
you can talk about the job , each other ... ... your sex lives .
i mean , only if you want to .
direct to camera .
no , thanks .
you could put a pottery wheel there .
look , mitch , this is an integral part of the show .
you' re obligated to spend five minutes a day in here .
we' ve provided a chair .
all you have to do is sit and share .
share ?
learn how to turn on your heart light .

i got one .
i wish i was dead .
you need a catch phrase ?
i got it .
when i' m about to make a bust  when did you ever make a bust ?

when i' m about to make a bust , to get in the moment ... ... i take three deep breaths and say to myself , " okay , trey , it' s showtime !
you say that ?
that' s stupid .
what' s stupid about it ?
know what ?
don' t say it , please .
no , i have to say it , mitch .
showtime . " it' s amazing .
that could be the name of our show !
see ?
it' s not stupid .
it' s perfect .
say it again for the camera .
do it again with the breathing .
my god , you' re a natural .
