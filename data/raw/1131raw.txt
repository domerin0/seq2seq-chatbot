you used to be my money guy , my assassin .
now in the time it takes you to do one job , wop along cassidy , here serves seven papers .
it would have been eight but i let joe have that one in miami .
the only reason that is is the mook can' t take miami .
it' s too damn hot down there .
miami' s not a city .
it' s a steam room with mosquitoes .
oh , that' s great , tony .
you' re a regular process serving savant .
what' d you call me ?
savant that' s somebody who' s really good at something ...

yeah , like i know everyone in new york with a brooklyn accent .
tony .
it' s got to be tony .
the son of a bitch .
he' s been tipping off my marks for two months .
that' s why it' s been so hard .
well , my heart bleeds for you .
i' m going to kill that son of a bitch !
mind your own business , pork chop .
goddamn monkeys .
hey , chico make it cooler , cooler .
culo . ? tu quieres culo ?
yo te doy culo !

este gringo me molesta ...
no gringo .
italiano .
mambo ltaliano .
no mambo ltaliano .
mambo king , armand assante .
mambo king soy yo .
hey , chico just drop me off in america , okay ?
agase para ... carajo , feo !
hey .
hey , i got another question .
how do people do it ?
i know you' re awake , so stop pretending to be asleep .
actually , i was pretending to be dead but i can' t fool you .
how can someone end a marriage like that , just ... pow ?
what ?
are you telling me you didn' t see this coming ?
let me guess .
a lot of trips out of town .
go ahead , honey .
go ahead .
don' t worry your pretty little head .
i' il take care of the homestead ...
not to mention those extra poker nights with the boys .
gordon doesn' t play poker .
missing my point .
look , i' ve served thousands of subpoenas .
granted , never one to somebody as hot as you .
i don' t know your husband but i do have a great deal of insight into men .
and we are mean , hurtful and despicable .
male headquarters would kill me if they knew i was telling you this .
yeah , well , " despicable " is putting it mildly .
and then , you complain that we get half of everything .
believe me , after this type of treatment half is the very least we should get .
the only thing you' re getting half of , honey is screwed .
what do you mean ?
he served you first .
he' s in texas , and he' s got home court advantage .
wait .
served me first ?
what is this ?
third grade ?
yeah , sometimes .
texas has the most conservative divorce laws in the country .
not to mention those good ol ' boy judges .
sure most of them aren' t married to their first wives .
believe me if i' d known this was coming
i' d have been the one doing the serving .
yeah .
how about that , huh ?
whatever .
no , seriously .
what would have happened if i' d served him first ?
okay , if you had served him first the trial would have been in new york not in texas where you would have fared a lot better .
50 % better , actually .
hey , i have a proposition for you .
you tear up the papers on me and i' il hire you to serve my husband .
i' il pay you twice what you' re getting now .
look , here' s what you don' t understand .
i' ve already told them that i served you , okay ?
so if i flip it and tag your husband my reputation will be shot .
i' il never work again .
i' il give you ten percent of my divorce settlement .
we own a cattle ranch .
it' s worth $20 million . $20 million ?
mm hmm .
ten percent of half ?
mm hmm .
you' re willing to pay me a million dollars .
well , that still leaves nine for me versus next to nothing .
it' s kind of a no brainer .
you' re really serious ?
i think we should draw up a contract .
let' s see ...
won' t be needing this .
one ... million ...
dollars ...
great , let' s go .
thanks a lot .
miami marriott .

yeah , well , all you have to do is point him out and then stay out of sight because if he sees you , we' re done .
is it okay if i strangle him from behind ?
yes , you can do whatever you want but wait until i serve him .

hey , you are going to have to get in control of your anger , okay ?
you made us look like fools in there .
i did ?
well , hey , at least i wasn' t beaten up by a girl .
hey , that was not a girl .
i distinctly saw an adam' s apple and a bulge that i was not comfortable with .
the only thing we had going for us was the element of surprise , and you blew that .
look , i know gordon' s habits .
i can easily find him again .
oh , what do you think ?
he' s just going to sit around , waiting for us to serve him ?
no , he' s history .
all he has to do is jump on the first international flight and then we' re done , all right ?
even if i find him
i can' t serve him outside the united states .
i don' t like your tone .
oh , you don' t like my tone , your highness ?
don' t forget , whenever i want , i can serve your papers again .
look , you can stand there and threaten me or we could just get in the car and go and find gordon .
oh , yeah ?
okay , where do you want to go ... boss ?
well , as your boss , i' d be interested in your suggestions .
this is crazy .
you' re crazy and i quit .
hey , i thought you were quitting .

the pepsi monster smash comes to dallas
the pepsi monster smash comes to dallas this friday , friday , friday !
and two shows saturday at the union arena .
see cyclops thrash ...
baby , i was down for the count
swimmin ' around , about to drown ...
i think we should find a hotel .
what ?
we' re making great time .
you said we' re like three hours away .
all i know is , is that if you sneak onto a cattle ranch in the middle of the night two things are guaranteed to happen : one , you' re going to tread in cow shit ; and two , you' re going to get shot .
so , you want to get a hotel ?
i' m living proof i can' t forget your face
it' s not impossible ...
come and get ' em , joe .
i' il be waiting .
oh , your sister' s ass .
don' t shoot !
don' t shoot !
hold up !
i' m no thief !
i' m just a process server .
ow !
let me get this straight .
you' re telling me you' re here from the motel' s parent company doing spot inspections ?
and i should give you a room for free so you can see how it is ?
that' s correct , sir .
and let me just say the degree of professionalism that you are exhibiting here today will undoubtedly go in my report .
well , let me just say that either you fork over $34 . 95 , or you are plumb out of luck , mister .
got me ?
we' re sleeping in the car .
let me have a go .
sir , we' ve been robbed .
please take pity on us .
lady , there ain' t no way in hell i' m going to give you a room here for free .
that' s , uh ... room 17 .
thank you .
oh , and we do have suites available as well .
and let me know if you need any ice .
i love you !
bummer .
hey ...
how was your bath ?
you mean shower .
there' s no tub in here .
oh , well , i' il call the concierge .
oh , no , wait a minute you got a free room in a dump .
tease me all you like .
i just don' t feel right if i don' t have a bath .
i don' t get you americans with your two minute showers .
well , it could be worse .
we could be french and skip the whole thing .
you must admit , though it' s pretty cool the way i got us our free room .
oh , yeah .
what are you doing ?
well , i' ve gotten into bed , and now i' m going to sleep .
no , i am the girl ; i get the bed .
all right , i' il tell you what why don' t you draw an imaginary line and i will promise not to cross it , okay ?
okay .
my line goes all the way around the bed .
i knew you were going to say that .
thank you .
oh , yeah .
comfy ?
yeah .
light' s out ?
no , you know what
i' m just going to stay up and read the bible for a while .
good night .
yeah , i guess i got the gist of it .
you know , assuming you serve gordon tomorrow what are you going to do with the money ?
why do girls always have another question after " good night " ?
come on , i' m just curious .
well ... if you must know
i was kind of hoping to have my own vineyard .
napa valley or somewhere .
come on , i' m being serious .
oh , seriously .
well ...
a while back i was this hotshot attorney .
i had all the attachments that go with that gig .
you know , a big house , nice car ... beautiful girlfriend .
fiancee actually .
that sounds terrible .
i can see why you turned your back on it .
well , anyway , i was given this high profile case to defend this guy in the cement business .
in other words , the mob .
really ?
how did you know that ?
i have an eye for that kind of stuff .
and he told me he was in the mob .
then i realized
i' d just become this cliche .
some sleazy defense attorney .
and at that moment , boom
i got out .
i don' t blame you .
well , the beautiful fiancee did .
as soon as the money ran out , so did she .
ow .
yeah , ow .
you know , all kidding aside after you quit , didn' t you miss the money ?
well , being successful isn' t all about money .
no .
so your girlfriend ditched you because you didn' t have enough money and my husband' s ditching me to get it all .
hmm .
all right , good night then .
good night then .
oh , all right .
all right , what ?
i moved the line .
oh .
it' s still there .
i just moved it a little .
oh .
come on .
thanks .
thank you .
oh , sorry .
that' s okay .
just don' t let it happen again .
gentlemen , i' d like to welcome you to my ranch .
now , i know in your country it' s polite to remove your shoes when you visit someone' s humble abode ...
who are all those japanese guys around gordon ?
i have no idea .
if you do that around here ...
go on , go serve him .
okay .
oh , no , wait .
who' s that ?
that is trouble .
wyatt earp looks pissed .
quick , let' s get out of here .
hey , vernon .
i need you for a minute .
boy , am i glad to see you two .
really ?
of course he is .
follow me .
okay .
well , you sure made it fast enough .
now , we' re just having the damnedest old time milking that old boy today .
well , that' s the problem .
see , if you want to get the milk you need to use a girl cow .
uh , you are the vet , right ?
yes , i am the vet .
and i' m the vet' s nurse .
um , it' s casual friday .
well , tornado over there , he' s normally our feistiest bull .
good for at least a quart a week .
but today , hell , we can' t even get his pump primed .
uh , would you all excuse me please ?
i need to talk with my ... nurse .
excuse me .
tell me they are not talking about what i think they' re talking about .
what do you think they' re talking about ?
masturbating an impotent bull .
ding , ding , ding , ding , ding !
so what do you think , doc ?
well , you know what , we just got a page uh , telling us that a sheep has fallen into a lake and is shrinking at an amazing rate .
just getting smaller and smaller .
go look over there .
yes , sir .
you better find somebody or it' s your ass .
how small can a sheep get , i guess .
so , um , how do you get things started ?
what do you do to get the bulls ... ready ?
you know , the regular way .
but we' ve been trying that for over an hour .
poor ol ' mickey , there , can' t even lift his arms up no more .
well , maybe it' s just a question of inspiration .
i mean , that is a very attractive rump but , uh , maybe tornado needs a little bit more oomph .
like what ?
have you tried a barry white cd ?
why don' t you just do what the other doc did when this happened to attila ?
you know , relieve the pressure on the prostate ?
prostate pressure .
right , um ...
nurse , did you bring the tools ?
um , no , i' m afraid i forgot them .
she forgot the tools .
can' t really do anything without the tools .
that' s all right , doc .
we got everything you need .
oh , dear god .
here , let me help .
let' s get you nice and lubricated .
how far up is the prostate ?
when you think you' ve got there , keep going .
we' re ready when you are , doc .
you fellows haven' t been feeding tornado any mexican food , have you ?
whoa .
get your dumb ass over here !
yes , mr. vernon .
keep looking !
i' m sorry .
go on , doc .
he ain' t gonna give you an invitation .
especially not from this end .
how' s it feel in there , doc ?
compared to what ?
better go a little further , doc .
ain' t nothing happening yet .
let me help you , doc .
whoo ha !
that' s the spot , doc !
you got it !
do it till you' re satisfied
whatever it is
do it , do it till you' re satisfied ...
damn , that thing sure looks like a fire hose .
do it till you' re satisfied
whatever it is
do it , do it ...
i' m uncomfortable .
help , oh ...
sure wish you folks could' ve been here a little earlier .
mr. moore came by and had a bunch of those corporate fellas with him and it was damn embarrassing .
old tornado couldn' t put on his usual show .
look at him go .
oh , great now l i' ve lost my ring .
what , was he giving them
iike a little special tour or something ?
i think it was a little more than a little tour .
i hear he' s trying to sell the whole damn company .
hey , you hear that , doc ?
mr. moore is trying to sell the whole damn company .
that' s fascinating .
i can' t believe that gordon is trying to sell his company .
mind you , i have to say
i think it' s good news for us .
well , you know if he' s in the middle of a big sales pitch he can hardly skip town .
you don' t seem very excited .
did you see what i just did in there ?
i' m going to need a minute , okay ?
a bull is lighting a cigarette in there because of me .
there goes my mark .
hey , come on .
let' s go back to dallas .
oh my god !
quick !
no , no , no ...
oh ...
come on , quick .
that guy must hate veterinarians .
no .
no , mr. cedron every ... everything' s under control , okay ?
i just need a little more time .
if everything' s so goddamn under control tell me what that process server was doing snooping around
gordon' s ranch up in durango this morning .
what ?
listen , dirtbag , by tomorrow morning
i' m going to have these papers out to three other firms .
that means you better get her served by the end of the day , or you' re off the case .
you understand ?
yeah , yeah .
page tony !
tony' s holding on line two .
how' d he do that ?
where the hell are you ? !
don' t give me any lip , ray .
i got shot .
what ?
some nurse is about to pick pellets out of my back with a pair of needle nosed pliers .
so just chill , all right ?
lucky for you these wounds are only superficial .
first we got to mow that lawn .
i' ve been meaning to get that done anyway .
mm hmm .
tony , where are you now ?

i found out joe and the girl were going to serve
mr. moore at his ranch in amarillo so i figured i' d ambush ' em .

whoa , whoa , whoa .

it' s just number one .
um , let me show you where it is .
so , are you from el salvador ?

well , he is a lucky man , you pink goddess of love .
no more callers .
we' ve got a winner .
wow .
i take it y' all don' t have a lot of wine down in el salvador .
what ?
oh , yes , no .
where i' m from , it' s mostly margaritas .
ole .

i' m sorry , i' m not all that into wines .
but my gordy sure is .
my gordy " ? !
oh , boy .
who the hell are you ? !
oh , you must be sara .
and you must be banging my husband .
i am truly sorry , sara .
mrs. moore to you , okay ?
look , things happen .
you shouldn' t blame yourself .
blame myself ?
are you insane ?
i' m blaming you , you twinkie and that asshole of a husband of mine .
so ...
come on , you !
well , you just got a quick glimpse into your future .
when it happens to you , page me .
adios , twinkie .
whoa .
let' s take the jag .
yeah , let' s take the jag .
i' d give my life for a hot bath .
what ?
a hot ...
are we suddenly deaf ?
no .
i just like hearing you say " hot bath .
oh .
well , i' d really like one .
i think i saw a motel 6 around here somewhere .
wouldn' t you prefer a five star hotel ?
sara , your breasts are great , but ...
joe .
uh , i don' t think they' re going to get us into a five star hotel .
do you think cash would ?
oh , yeah .
oh , hello , marble bathtub .
yes !
do you mind if i have a $9 bottle of water ?
coming up .
thanks .
so , it says here that gordon' s going to sell all his assets to some company kobe west ?
yeah , and , let' s not forget , behind my back .
music ?
yeah .
so , a quick divorce then he makes the deal , huh ?
nice .
yeah , i know .
seems like gordon cares about the money more than anything .
unbelievable .
yeah , unbelievable .
i have something else to show you .
i did a bit more stealing from gordon .
in fact , i got his passport so he can' t leave the country .
nice work , 99 .
thank you .
hey , you know what ?
he went to st. barth' s twice in the last month .
and , hey , look at this .
acapulco on the 17th .
that was our wedding anniversary .
i distinctly remember him saying he had to do business in omaha .
instead , he was , um , doing kate in mexico .
sara , if gordon can' t tell how beautiful and sexy and intelligent you are , then he is an idiot .
and now i' m an idiot for saying way too much .
didn' t sound like too much to me .
' cause when we' re torn apart
shattered and scarred
love has the grace to save us
we' re just two tarnished hearts
when in each other' s arms ...
am i hearing waves ?
don' t you mean fireworks ?
no , waves .
bugger !
oh !
oh , god .
sorry about that .
no , no , that' s ... that' s okay .
well , i think i' il just , uh , go ahead and get in the bath .
great idea .
i got some mr. bubbles in my bag .
alone .
you know , i think our priority has to be to find gordon .
business first .
right , yeah .
business first .
you know , i was just about to say the same thing , so ...
okay .
okay .
well , i' m going to go out and get some fresh air ... alone .
hi .
hi .
i' m a veterinarian .
a cow just beeped me .
my ship came in , and she sunk it
i was the toast of the town , and she drunk it
i had a run of good luck
and she ran it right into the ground
and now she' s puttin ' on a show
and i get to play the clown
i had the wind in my sails , and she took it ...
hey , hey , hey .
how' s maria ?
very funny .
can i get you something , honey ?
i would really love a miller longneck .
you got it .
let' s get down to business , shall we ?
okay .
look , gordon is a complete jerk .
this much we agree on .
and believe me , i didn' t need his ex wife to tell me that .
i' m in it for the money .
really ?
yeah .
and i know how this works .
if you serve gordon first then he' s going to new york and sara gets half of a whole lot of money .
but to serve him , you have to find him .
and you know where he is .
look , there is no way that gordon' s marrying me without a prenup so if i want to be a really rich lady and i do
i have got to wait on him hand and foot for the next 20 years .
thank you .
thank you .
or ...
i can serve him up to you for , let' s say ... a million dollars ?
and i' il never have to see him again .
everybody wins .
except for gordo .
exactly .
just one snag , though .
none of the money is mine .
i' d have to talk to sara first .
so talk .
hey .
hey .
nice robe .
thank you .
where' d you get to ?
you' il see .
hmm ?
what the hell is she doing here ?
she paged me .
why ?
look , before you get all in a ... tizzy hear her out , okay ?
she' s got a great plan .
look , before we get into all that
i just wanted to say , sara
i feel really badly about stealing your husband .
so badly , in fact , that there' s a guy i' d like you to meet .
sara moore , you are hereby served for divorce under the laws governing the great state of texas .
joe !
do something .
take another one for my buddy
joe here , just to bust his balls .
cheese .
beautiful , beautiful .
thank you .
mmm ...
classic honey trap .
oldest trick in the book .
you should read it sometime .
oh , and i' il see you back in new york when you come to clean out your desk ass wipe .
look what i got .
he is cute .
it' s too bad he' s just a process server .
so , one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and suddenly you' re stupid ?
it' s not the way this was supposed to go down .
how could you blow this ?
it seemed like a good idea at the time .
look , sara , can we just focus on what we have to do now ?
yes , we can .
you can focus on getting the hell out of this hotel room .
go .
get out of here .
leave .
good bye .
good bye ?
that' s it ?
yeah .
go on .
there' s nothing else to say .
you a genius , you hear me ?
a goddamn genius !
that' s all right .
you know what ?
it' s only been three white geniuses ever .
oh , yeah .
da vinci , stallone in the first rocky and now you , tony .
oh , thank you , ray .
i swear ...
i love you for this , boy .
i love you for this .
you know what ?
i need you to fax me a copy of the papers take the originals down to the courthouse and get your butt back here .
oh , yeah .
i' m going to buy you the biggest steak in manhattan .
you hear me ?
on my way .
on my way , fast as i can .
okay .
look here , you know what ?
it' s okay ... fly first class .
first class ?
good .
first class ... all right .
what ?
whoa , whoa ... wait a minute .
make that business class .
business ?
okay .
mm hmm .
i gotcha , uh huh , huh
you thought i didn' t see ya now , didn' t ya ?
uh huh ... now give me what you promised me
give it here , come on !
i wore myself out .
did he ... ?
wait a minute , i need a phone .
i need a phone !
ray , joe' s on line one .
hello , loser .
you little dirty ... you ... you tried to double cross me , didn' t you ?
you know what ?
i got something for you .

yeah , i guess you really got me , ray .
that' s right .
who' s my bitch , huh ?
who' s my bi ... tch ?
yeah , i' m your bitch .
so , uh , did tony make the plane okay ?
you know what ?
he sure did .
and he' s flying first class , too .
oh ... see ...
i was really hoping that he didn' t drop the papers off at city hall .
well , you can hope all you want to , gladys
' cause he did .
it' s over .
now , you probably have a , uh ... copy of that file lying around somewhere .
would you mind , uh , telling me what time my career officially ended ?
i' d love to know that .
7 : 04 .
you hear that ?
remember it , write it down , paint a picture
i don' t care what you do .
seven , zero , and then it' s a big four after that .
it' s over .

i can still serve gordon .
i' ve still got 49 minutes .
49 .
you know that number .
your l . q.

i can tell you exactly where he is right now .
milt , you are a beautiful , beautiful man .
all right , he' s at the southwest corner of lakeville and beverly .
i looked it up .
it' s some fancy steak house .
you got it .
you just made five grand .
sure , but after taxes ... ?
on the screens ahead of you , we will run our safety video .
but first , the captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign , and we' il be departing shortly .
please remain seated as we back away from the gate .
sir , please take your seat .
no , excuse me .

i' m a heart surgeon and i got a patient that needs an emergency ... heart .
what' s the matter ?
i don' t look like a goddamn heart surgeon to you ? !

uh huh , yeah , we did .
listen , there is just one tiny little thing .
we didn' t " get her " get her , though .
i ...
i mean , in a way , we got her but not like if you get somebody .
you know how , you say
iike if you was playing hide and go get it and you get it , but you don' t really get none of it but you get it ?
that' s kind of the way that we got her is she got , but not really got , if you know what i' m saying .
it' s kind of an enigma .
now to us , beef might be a big deal but to a cow , it' s just another day .
you know what to do .
keep them boys tethered .
sit .
shh .
oh , and i got a belly full of steer .

ooh ... damn longhorns .
uh , gordon ...
