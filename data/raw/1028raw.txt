i can' t believe you' re just a dishwasher .

can i have another cookie ?
no !
all right , tell me your idea .
i told you my idea .
you shot it down .
you gonna tell me or have a tantrum ?
you know , for some reason you' re always shooting down my dreams .
because your dreams are like the ones people get from putting opium in brownies .
can i just tell you this ?
you' re not a bank robber .
your two year vacation proved it .
not as a stick up man , that' s all .
when i hit that bank that time , we were inexperienced , the whole group of us all put on ronald reagan masks so it was confusing , i didn' t know who was who .
you' re lucky your lawyer knew the judge !
can i tell you my idea ? !
' a few weeks ago , a couple of doors down from the bank ,
' a pizza joint there folded and it' s for rent , frenchy . '
and then it hits me , and believe me , i' m no genius ...
yeah , you don' t have to sell me . .. but i figure we tunnel under , take the pizza joint , we come up under the bank vault .
i know the layout cos i used to know a guard i got diagrams .
we clean out the vault , we go to florida .
ray , we' re poor but we' re happy .
no , you' re always complaining .
are you happy doing cuticles ?
is that what you want ?
mother said never get involved with a guy from the rackets .
frenchy , what' s wrong ?
we had dreams .
what' s gotten into you ?
did ... did we not have dreams ?
when we met , yes , granted , i was in rackets .
i was running numbers , you were an exotic dancer , your parents didn' t approve .
i tried to go legit , ok ?
i know .
what do you want me to do ?
' b but this pizza place is just waiting for us . '
ray , it' s gonna look suspicious , a group of guys drilling in an empty store .
no , that' s where you come in , you front it .
what ?
you front it , you make pizzas .
i can' t cook pizzas !
so cook cookies !
what' s the difference ? !
tell fortunes , you look like a gypsy , make it a travel agency .
you work there and we tunnel under into the bank .
god ...
frenchy , come here .
you see how beautiful this is ?
yeah .
what you see , it' s not just new jersey .
when we first met there was a sunset just like this , very ...
remember ?
mm hm .
yeah .
but in columbia there was an earthquake !
sorry , the location was taken by someone else .
what ? !
yesterday .
i told you , if you waited too long ...
who did ?
wh who took the place ?
can you give me ... ?
you got the name ?
mrs neddy goldberg .
oh , jesus .

i believe a flower shop .
a flower shop ?
it' s a little old lady , her husband just died and she wants to start a flower shop .
somebody' s got to get to her .
get to her what ?
beg her , con her .
i' il go to her shop and threaten her .
no , you can' t .
don' t do that .
i gotta talk to her .
and say what ?
if her husband just died , you need a plan .
i don' t know .
i' il charm her .
what are you gonna use for charm , ray ?
knock it off .
some master plan , you lost the lease .
i' il get it , that' s what this is about .
you' re gonna rob a bank and some little old lady has it first .
very funny , what ... you ... you ...
i' il slam your head off .
hey !
jesus .
the bank isn' t even next to the pizza joint .
i told you that before !
that' s what' s great ...
what ?
there' s nothing suspicious .
the only thing suspicious is your sanity .
and when did you guys ever dig a tunnel ? .
it' s no big deal .
you underestimate ray' s personality .
he' s the most likeable dishwasher i ever met .
don' t pay any attention to her , we' re gonna proceed .
uh ...
yeah ?
i' m looking for neddy goldberg .
who wants her ?
uh , i got something for her .
i wanna make her a big offer .

i don' t know how to .
there' s nothing to that .
whoever' s working it , i tell ya , it' s gonna make a lot of noise .
no , no , hey , what do you think this is ?
we wrap this blanket around it , it' s fine .
no , no , you gotta know how to work that .

there was a woman on before , she' s got 200 pairs of shoes .
you' il get yours frenchy , i promise you .
this time in a month or two we' il be in miami , it' il be great .
a patron of the arts " , don' t that sound great ?
frenchy ...
opening night at the opera .
i love you , frenchy , you know why ?
because you back me all the time .
you know when i first knew i loved you ?
this was a long time ago if you remember .
remember i taught you how to open a safe by listening to the tumblers , and you got it .
that' s when i knew .
you' re a very romantic man , and i' m very lucky because not many wives get to see their husbands battling a ruptured water main .
i' m crazy about you .
i' m crazy about you .
here , benny .
benny , put it in the bag .
you ...
i' il ...
he puts it in the bag .
this is efficiency .
hurry up !
what ...
why are you putting it in his shovel ? .
he puts it in .
it' s called efficiency .
it saves energy .
chocolate chip , please .
here .
little girl , what do you want ?
chocolate fudge .
ok .
you can only have two .
what are you stopping for ?
why ?
i' m trying to figure this out !
according to this , we' re supposed to take a left turn .
that doesn' t mean stop !
let' s go !
will you give me a ...
what the hell are you doing ?
what ?
you got your hat on backwards .
yeah , so ?
the flashlight goes in the front !
but it looks cooler like this .
what are you , a jerk ?
it' s a lot more stylish than that look at that !
you think so ?
yeah , turn it around .
this is chic .
yeah , look at that .
that' s cool .
you got a mirror ?
no , i don' t .
that looks good , i' il show you when we get out .
can you keep going , please ?
i' m trying to figure the map out !
you want two ?
ok , ok , everybody hold on .
that' s 1 . 70 , that' s it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
ok , here ... chocolate chip ... what you gonna do with your share ?
how much is my share ?
well , i figure there' s gotta be two million ,
i' m counting the jewellery too .
divided four ways , that' s a half million bucks apiece .
what about frenchy ?
she' s just a front .
but without her we' re dead .
any broad could sell cookies .
i say she gets a share but not a full share .
i' d go for that .
what if we each get a fourth and she gets , like , a third ?
she' d be getting more than us .
how you figure ?
where you gonna get four fourths and a third ?
i don' t do fractions .
let' s not get greedy .
remember that bogart movie where they' re digging for gold ?
they find the gold and then this guy turns on his friends .
let' s not let that happen .
and he' s killed by hispanics .
the treasure of ...
treasure island .
right !
that was a good movie .
the best .
ok , folks , here' s the deal .
i' m out of cookies , ok ?
it' s gonna be another two minutes .
that' s the way the cookie crumbles .
i' ve got one cookie left , you know who' s gonna eat this ?
me .
i gotta put on help .
help ?
yeah , i can' t handle the volume .
what ... ?
a second person ?
i can' t help it , ray , the cookies are selling .
gee , i never counted on that .
you gotta manage it somehow .
what about my cousin may ?
we can trust her .
may' s a dodo , i bring a dodo into a master plan ?
she' s not a squealer .
but we' d have to cut her in .
the pot' s getting smaller and smaller .
well , i can' t cook and sell at the same time , it' s a madhouse , we' il get caught .
hey , you know what we could do ?
may ...
we could hire may and not tell her what we' re doing .
and she ... she' il never catch on .
she' s got , you know , and ...
we' re making enough from the cookies to pay her .
absolutely , she' il never figure out or catch wise to anything .
if you think denny' s slow , your cousin may is dumb like a ...
like a horse or a dog or something .
maybe it' s not such a great idea .
no , i think ...
i think we could do it .
where are we ?
supposed to be here .
excuse me !
where' s the sugar ?
frenchy wants sugar .
may , stop bothering us , we' re busy here .
i just don' t understand the drilling .
i told you , business is good , we' re expanding .
yeah , a little tea shop so people can eat cookies and drink tea .
where are they gonna drink the tea , in the tunnel ? .
i' d explain it but you gotta understand engineering .
what' s engineering ?
may , do me a favour , i told you , we' re expanding .
but there' s a nail shop next door .
we made a deal with them .
you' re expanding into there ?
may , get your stuff .
you want the sugar ...
take a hike .
get the sugar and go , we' il call you .
this broad' s big trouble .
is it safe having that broad around ?
she' s harmless .
i think we' ve made a wrong turn .
oh , please !
give me the map .
what' re you talkin ' about ?
for god' s sakes .
this is fine , i don' t know what you' re in a dither about .
you' re holding it upside down .
i am ?
you were reading this upside down all along ?
get off my back .
can i help it if they print these things like this ?
ok , thank you very much .
i gotta get another plate of the ... cherry ...
can i help you ?
next ?
i' m coming right back .
can i get two cherry cinnamon ?
how you doin ' ?
we' re doin ' something right !
two cherry cinnamon .
you new here , huh ?
no , this is my first day .
these are the greatest cookies i ever tasted .
oh , really ?
we' re expanding .
no kidding ?
yeah , some guys are working right now ,
tunnelling under next door .
really ?
yeah .
did you try the fudge ?
we were talking about what a success this place is .
about the restaurant .
what restaurant ?
you know , the guys in the back tunnelling under the nail shop ?
what are you talking about ?
the tea room .
may , come here !
we' re at the sunset bake shop where the lines wait patiently for the most fabulous cookies in new york .
what' s goin ' on here ? !
and you' re the heart of sunset cookies , miss ... ?
frenchy winkler .
frances , but everybody calls me frenchy .
standing here , one can inhale the aroma of chocolate , cinnamon and a dozen other mouth watering taste treats .
is it true customers wait half an hour for a cookie ?
that you' ve rationed sales ?
well , it happened once but ... what' s all the fuss ?
where did you learn the secret of your baking ?
it' s all i can cook , that and linguine with turkey meatballs .
sir , how is your cookie ?
i don' t know , it' s baked with nutmeg or something .
but it' s great .
and we' re expanding , there are men in the back tunnelling ...
no , no , may !
get back !
i can' t take this , frenchy !
we don' t want this attention .
i didn' t hire a publicity agent , they just showed up .
i know , but it' s putting us in the toilet !
i can' t concentrate , there' s people demanding cookies , and denny got bit by a rat , he needed rabies shots .
who , the rat ?
funny .
you should be on tv .
i am !
open your eyes !
frenchy , i don' t like this .
you' ve been digging for weeks , when you gonna get somewhere ?
it' s complicated , we keep getting lost !
the other day i was in deep and my hat went out .
that stupid coal miner' s hat ?
it' s a life saver , that bulb !
we' d do better just with a cookie store , we' re making good dough .
hey , making good dough !
it' s a cookie store but we' re making dough .
we' re making dough but ...
i get it .
i knew we were going the wrong way !
what are we doin ' in a dress shop ?
at least it' s a sunday , we can patch this up and get out .
patch it up ? !
tile it !
i' m not a tiler .
we don' t have any tiles !
where do you get cement in a dress shop ?
besides , braln , how can you close the hole and tile it ?
we' re inside the store !
how do we get out ?
well ...
he' s got a point .
you can' t tile it from that side .
no kidding .
no , you can' t .
this is very discouraging , guys , i' m ready to pack this in .
everybody freeze !
ray , your wife' s cousin talks too much .
sorry to spoil your expansion plans ...
officer , listen , we didn' t do anything yet .
it' s true , we were gonna ... rob the bank but we screwed up everything except for the cookie shop , that' s doing great , you like the cookies !
let us forget all this and just concentrate on the cookie store .
hey , look , i' m not trying to ruin anybody' s life , ok ?
then , give us a break .
think i could get a piece of the action ?
i don' t mind paying off the cops .
it' s a standard business expense .
don' t think of it as a pay off .
i think i' m qualified to make a major contribution to this whole enterprise .
my brother in law majored in business .
let us hear this contribution .
one word .
yeah , and that word is ?
franchise .
' we got about 600 trucks and we' re all over the country
' and canada , and we make a lot of different cookies now .
' we got pistachio , we got pretzels ,
' we make chicken chip cookies , tuna mint ... '
' virtually overnight ,
' the winklers and associates have gone from a small cookie shop
' to something approaching a baking empire . '
this is where we package everything , you know ?
and , uh ... we , uh ... the cookies have a wonderful fresh smell and that' s put on with a chemical spray .
we do that here .
there' s no denying he' s refreshingly down to earth for a corporate executive .
in fact , sunset farms has captured the imagination of the public and the industry .
we wondered what the competition thinks , so we went to american cookies .
the bottom line is they make a great product .
and everything else pretty much takes care of itself .
this is your office ?
yeah , this is where i operate .
frenchy decorated this place , she' s got ... all her stuff here .
this is an antique , you know .
she says it' s louis the ...
i don' t know , louis xlv , or xv .
i don' t know how high the louis go , actually , but it' s a top louis , one of the ...
and frenchy stuck a tv in it , you know , because she' s got a ... you know , she' s a creative decorator .
it' s very original .
um , how much are you worth ?
oh , plenty .
plenty .
how much ?
between you and me .
a lot .
i mean , whatever you see is antiques .
you know , this thing here , this is from the renaissance or the magna carta or something but that' s where it' s from .
why did you decide to go into baking so late in life ?
well , frenchy , we found out , can make cookies .
' the frenchy they' re talking about
' and culinary genius of sunset is frances fox ,
' the wife of the ceo . '
so everybody told you how delicious your cookies were ?
i thought they were bsing me .
really ?
yeah , cos someone gives you something they cooked you always say you enjoy it even if you threw up , so , you know .
in an age where everyone has public relations handlers it' s hard to imagine a group more direct and less image conscious than sunset farms .
each person we met seemed more eccentric than the last ,
like tommy walker , the chairman .
frenchy makes the best cookies in the world .
we' re very proud .
what are your duties as chairman ?
the board meets twice a week and we take up issues .
issues ?
yeah , facts , problems , things like that .
what problems does an overnight success like sunset farms face ?
last week the toilet on the fourth floor wouldn' t flush .
the water kept coming to the top , so the board voted on getting a plumber .
' an architect of sunset farms ' unorthodox marketing strategy
' is head of advertising , denny doyle , a former truck driver . '
did you have the idea to advertise in playboy , penthouse and hustler ?
i figured if a guy' s staring at a naked piece of tail , he sees the breasts and the legs , he' s gonna salivate .
so if he' s salivating and turns the page and comes across a picture of our cookies , he thinks maybe that' s why he' s drooling .
it' s psychology .
it' s science .
it' s like pablo' s theory , with the dog when he feeds him ?
pablo ?
pablo , with the dogs .
' then there' s ex police officer ken deloach ,
' in charge of distribution .
' and benjamin borkowsky , in charge of plant safety . '
i made sure the building was fireproof .
' and lest they be accused of being a male club ,
' may sloane handles public relations and physical therapy . '
i understand public relations , but physical therapy ?
well , all the chocolate chips are put in by hand and that' s really hard on the back and the leg muscles .
i do deep massage .
she' s also a vice president .
so that' s a brief glimpse into a corporate culture that has industry leaders and management analysts scratching their heads , wondering what sunset farms will try next .
but it may be as simple as the winklers ' chief competitor said .
you' ve got something people want , everything else falls into place .
or as we in tv might say , there' s no accounting for the public' s taste .
keep coming through with the stuff .
i think it' s better the way i had it .
put the doll there .
mrs winkler ?
you wanted to check the menu ?
right .
stevens , bring that piece downstairs and try it again next to the fireplace .
i want a lot of nuts and crudites .
what did we say for openers ?
yeah , snails .
escargot , yes , then potato and truffle salad .
by all means , but i hate those thin pieces .
when you shave it , lay it on big time .
truffles are always shaved finely , mrs winkler .
i wouldn' t suggest anything overdone .
.. then poached sea bass in filo , and spinach souffle and salad and dessert .
and finger bowls .
nothing being served requires them .
you never know whose fingers need washing .
did you rearrange this again ?
hold your water !
every time i come home it' s like walking into a strange house .
did i tell you to get rid of this ?
it' s a harp .
you got no flair , ray .
nobody plays the harp .
who plays it ?
what' s it doing in the living room ?
i like the visual sweep .
you know , i don' t know what' s gotten into you , you' re so hoity toity all of a sudden .
my cookies pay for this , so turn it off .
what' s for dinner ?

oh , no kidding ?
you' re the outfielder with the padres ?
our goal is to raise $2 million , then the company can tour the west coast and include the new opera .
right .
well , count me in .
i love serious music .
ray , on the other hand , opera freaks him .
have you tried your finger bowl ? . ?
so the guy says , " what do you do for a living ?
he says , " i' m a monback .
he says , " what' s a monback ?
you know , i stand behind a truck saying " ' monback " !
h he stands behind the truck , he goes " ' monback " !
he says ...
i think it' s too fast for her .
' monback .
he says ' monback .
i do think they overpaid for the picasso .
i mean , for me it was unusually mediocre , don' t you think ?
i agree completely .
excuse me , i have to go find my wife .
i saw a beautiful painting of fruit at the met or the whitney , it might have been the holocaust .
are you affiliated with any of the museums ?
no , i' m a private dealer .
we have one or two paintings but i haven' t gotten around to ...
building a collection .
uh huh .
so what are you interested in ?
er , rembrandt , picasso , michelangelo .
you know , the boys .
yeah , yeah .
i might be out of michelangelos at the moment .
but i have come into possession of an incredible damon dexter that someone' s trying to sell , is he ... ?
i' m not aware of him .
no , well , he' s new , you know .
i have to say , your wine is absolutely delicious .
really .
the chef who did the finger bowls chose it .
have you rinsed ?
david used to own a vineyard , so he' s a tough audience .
did you study art at school ? .
no , i didn' t .
i think i should have .
no , i studied literature .
then inevitably wound up as a stockbroker , then i dropped out , went to japan and became a buddhist blah blah blah , and then i did teach art for a bit .
and then the vineyard .
my god , what a life , and you' re still so young !
don' t be fooled .
somewhere in a closet there' s a portrait of me ageing .
in the closet ?
why would it be ... ?
oh !
how droll .
you hear about the polish carpool ? .
every day they meet at work .
i can' t believe this room .
this takes bad taste to new heights .
this is excruciating .
and can you believe them ?
i can' t keep a straight face .
and this apartment , the flawless vulgarity .
she must' ve been frightened by a leopard .
i think they plan on being very generous .
and the house ?
not to mention her clothes .
this is the definition of bad taste .
i never saw so much jewellery .
it makes me sad that i don' t have to steal any more .
really .
what' s the matter , honey ?
you' ve been quiet all night .
what' s bothering you ?
what' s bothering me is that we got no class .
speak for yourself , i was very charming tonight .
ray , i went to sit in the bar .
they were in there talking about us .
you shoulda heard ' em .
and they were right .
we got more dough than all of them .
it ain' t dough .
it' s knowing the finer things .
like what ?
opera ?
like food and wine and painting and books .
stop it , will you ?
i' m unimpressed .
all my life i' ve been ignorant , i could never afford to learn .
and i was a good student ...
well , i was a lousy student and i always hated school .
if i could find my school principal today ,
i' d put a contract out on her .
class is something you can' t fake and can' t buy .
i got more class in my little finger than them .
we came into a few bucks but we' re phoneys , we' re trying to act like big shots .
not me .
well , me .
but the time has come to use our dough to amount to something .
like what ?
to change our lives .
i' m too busy to change my life .
doing what ?
playing pinball ? .
i don' t wanna wear a tux any more , i wanna go to florida and swim .
well , i wanna be the real thing .
wise up , because if i grow and you stay as stupid as you are , we' re gonna have big problems , ray .
smarten you up , is that what you said ?
yeah , you said you were a teacher , you know art , opera , books , wine , you know , we want to learn it all , don' t we , ray ?
i' m flattered you think i' m capable of ...
turning two slugs like us into classy items ?
no homework .
i never did any when i was young , i' m not ...
you know , not doing anything that' s got homework .
naturally , we' d make it worth your while , david .
no , it' s absolutely not about money , it' s just that ... i' ve never been asked to do anything like this .
i' m not sure i' d know where to start .
i know i gotta get a better vocabulary .
have you ever thought about enrolling in college ?
i didn' t go to high school , why would i go to college ?
that takes four years , we want a private crash course , right ?
am i crazy ?
she' s nuts !
david , tell her she' s nuts .
what are ...
i' m gonna learn about life suddenly ?
i must say , frenchy , ray has a point , you know .
he could probably teach me more about life than i could teach you .
what' s he gonna teach you ?
i can figure the point spread and count cards at blackjack .
close your bazoo .
i can ...
close your bazoo !
i don' t want to be discouraging because what you propose is admirable ...
i' d like to be able to spell connecticut .
don' t ask why , i never knew how to spell connecticut .
fair enough .
you could teach him that , right ?
yeah .
you said this is a slow period in the art market and we would take ver y good care of you , right ?
like i say , i don' t want to discourage you ...
i' d just have to think about it a bit , i haven' t ...
if i could envisage a plan , a starting point .
we could start by , you know , building our art collection .
you' d make a few bucks and we can learn something .
but i' m not going to museums .
the ... pictures spook me out ...
virgins ...
what are you laughin ' at ?
spooked by the virgins !
i' m sorry .
work on the laugh .
you can see the difference between this tintoretto and the earlier byzantine painting we looked at .
what would you say is the most significant difference ?
i would say that the frame' s bigger here .
mm hm .
yeah , it is bigger , but there' s also a difference in the paintings themselves and it' s important because it characterises the great technical leap from the ancient into the modern world .
you remember how the saints had very flat faces and the background was on the same plane as the foreground ?
perspective .
right , perspective .
let me show you another very good example of that .
the frame on this one is bigger " ?
oh , boy , you are a dummy .
hey , don' t give me " perspective .
take a hike , will ya ?
28 .
four .
lev axle .
51 .
you niv dee can .
87 .
90 .
darvo sed .
four .
red do .
10 .
i' m hungry .
learn something .
there' s nothing to learn !
this is where henry james lived .
who ?
the band leader , stupid .
married to betty grable ?
yes !
no , you' re thinking of harry james , who' s brilliant too .
this is henry james , the author .
oh .
yeah ?
this is where he lived and worked and ...
i don' t care where he lived , where did he eat ?
the heiress , right ?
the " h " is silent .
oh .
did he write that too ?
oh ...
frenchy !
frenchy , i' m still sick .
i' m weak , i can' t go .
you' re gonna miss an interesting " great books " discussion .
yeah , i know .
it kills me .
but i ...
i' m just gonna lay here .
see you when you come back .
hello .
hello .
ray' s got a cold .
i bet 500 .
500 ?
see your five , raise you 500 .
i' m out .
i' il see the five , and a thou .
what did you think of the book ?
well , i thought it was very romantic .
i mean , he loved her but their backgrounds were so different .
right .
so you thought it was doomed from the start ?
i guess , cos he wound up dead , but i think that two people from different backgrounds can make it if , er ... the juice is there .
right .
sorry , juice is ... is ?
you know , the hots .
right .
wine , would you like some wine ?
i brought over a bottle of chateau margaux .
we can compare that to my clos de la roche and see the difference between a bordeaux and a burgundy .
i' ve got two others of the same vintage that i thought it might be fun to try .
i see the five , i raise a thou .
i' il see it , raise you a thousand more .
and a thousand .
and a thousand .
ok .
call .
read it and weep , a pair of threes .
oh , good , i thought you were bluffing .
so what do you wanna play now ?
what about indian poker ?
seven cards , hold them over your head , nobody sees their hand , we bet on each other' s hands , high low , wild cards all the reds .
do you wanna sit down , may ?
old maid ?
can you play old maid ?
so , um ... try this one .
well , ok .
nice nose .
yeah , the bouquet is very special .
no , i mean you got a nice nose .
me ?
yeah .
i can' t describe it , it' s like kind of ...
it' s just any old nose ...
aquiline .
yeah , um , talking of which , how is your vocabulary coming along ?
oh , good .
i' m almost through all the " a " words in the dictionary .
right , right .
thing is , i' m not convinced that memorising the dictionary is the best way to improve your vocabulary .
hmm .
yeah .
you sold the damon dexter so fast and at such a good price .
that' il really take a bite out of our debts .
oliver , it' s dawning on me that the opportunity has arisen for me to become quite , er , obscenely rich .
they' re serious about an art collection ?
no , that would be peanuts .
what , then ?
well , i think that she might be falling for me .
frenchy winkler ?
how much do you think she' s worth , roughly ?
her husband , you mean ?
no , it' s all in her name .
what are you saying ?
i don' t know , i suppose i' m saying ... people grow and marriages sadly break up and ... women remarry , you know ?
fortunes , they change hands .
what is this ?
it' s a damon dexter , a discovery of david' s .
i say it' s depressing .
you wouldn' t know a masterpiece if it bit you .
i refuse to look at this .
what does that mean ?
it means i won' t look at that wall .
oh !
you' re a head case .
i bet david made a profit on this .
whose cookies pay the rent , huh ?
he' s making a fool out of you !
stevens , what time is it ?
i no longer look at this wall .
11am , sir .
thank you very much .
david , what' s this ?
oh ...
oh , that ?
that' s a citrine necklace .
you know about citrines ?
no .
they' re not precious stones , but the lustre' s very special .
and that ?
ah ...
talking about lustre ...
uh huh .
this is very special and very , very expensive .
it' s a cigarette case that belonged to the duke of windsor .
i know the duke of windsor !
he also married beneath his station , right ?
he did , he did , like our friend henry higgins .
it was such a romantic story , i saw it on television .
uh huh ?
ray ?
ray !
what are you doin ' here ?
i' m ... having chinese food .
that' s what they serve in a chinese restaurant .
you want some company ?
who ?
who' s talking to you ?
me !
all right ... but where' s frenchy ?
she' s at a concert , some piano concert with a guy .
oh .
they have take out here but they won' t deliver to a concert .
don' t worry about it , may .
prelude in b minor , opus 32 #
dinner was so great , may .
all that msg and the grease , it was just ...
what a treat .
i' m so sick of continental food every night .
you know , frenchy eats frogs ' legs .
do they taste like chicken ?
rabbit .
rabbit tastes like frog legs ?
no ...
forget it , forget it .
are you happy being rich ?
it' s ok .
i got a lot of charge accounts and a really , really nice apartment and a maid .
i' m still lonely though .
yeah ?
how come ?
the guy i was seeing left me because he was so embarrassed about being poor and hated that i paid for everything .
so i stopped paying , and that' s when he left me .
yeah , i can ... understand your ...
you ... you enjoy being rich ?
i hate it .
you' re kidding ?
no , i hate the life , you know ?
it' s making me lose frenchy .
what ?
i mean she' s outgrowing me , that' s what she said .
she' s a different person .
i think she' s got a crush on her teacher , david .
yeah , well , he' s very good looking and really bright ,
very charming and elegant ...
ok , i got the picture .
you really know how to make a guy feel good .
when you' re right , you' re right .
thank you .
what did you think of it ?
i thought the whole evening was apocalyptic .
apocalyptic ?
totally .
i really was agog .
well , me too , she' s fabulous .
and i have to asseverate she deserves accolades .
have you been memorising the dictionary ?
yeah .
next week the " b" s .
how do i look ?
i have to say , that dress is just ... gorgeous .
see ?
your influence .
low key , right ?
well , that' s very flattering ...
ray thinks it' s dullsville .
david ?
paige .
wasn' t rachmaninoff inspired ?
wasn' t it ?
i thought it might incur my animadversion
but realised it was apposite .
a ha !
i think i see drinks .
good to see you , david .
nice meeting you .
i love your friends , david .
they' re so bright and cultured and refined , it' s another world .
it' s a world i know you' d love to belong to .
this looks a lot more civilised .
oh , beautiful .
let' s take a seat here .
' anything we get , cody' s in for his full share .
' that' s how it is . '
you know why i respect cody ?
why ?
because he loves his mother .
i understand that , may .
even though he' s a cold blooded killer and she encourages him , still , it' s sweet .
yeah , i wish i had a mother like that .
more pepsi ?
yeah , please .
and this is the best part , i love this part .
yeah ...
will you pass me the crackerjack ?
what are you lookin ' at ?
i happen to be noticin ' you ,
i was lookin ' at you a couple of times tonight , cos for the first time i had the thought that in a very , very strange way , you got a sweet face .
it' s off beat in a kind of bizarre ... you know .
i don' t know how to explain it exactly , but it' s ... it' s right up there .
what d' you mean ?
it' s a compliment , may ,
i' m trying to say a nice thing .
cos you being a relative of frenchy
i never before classified you as a human type female .
so ...
i i i was married .
a long time ago , right ?
it was a really tragic story because my husband , otto , was dyslexic , and the only thing he could spell was his name .
that is ...
that' s , er ...
there' s no doubt about it , burgundy really goes to my head .
what did you want to talk about ?
i' ve , um ...
well , i' ve ... got a little present for you .
for me ?
yeah .
here .
oh ... pretty ...
i love leather books .
oh , pygmalion .
i love that story , david .
there' s a little inscription .
to my favourite eliza ,
from your professor higgins , love david .
i got a confession to make .
what ?
i got you a present too .
oh , no , you didn' t have to do that .
it' s in appreciation of all the stuff you' ve been doing for me .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , frenchy ...
this is ...
frances !
frances , this is ...
it must have cost you a fortune .
what good' s having dough unless you spend it , huh ?
this is ... this is so extravagant ...
i i' m embarrassed .
don' t take up smoking , but if it' s good enough for the duke of windsor , right ?
well , i' m really overwhelmed and my little bernard shaw is so insignificant ...
no .
but you see i just ...
i just wanted you to know how unbelievably proud i am of you .
david , this is not insignificant .
maybe i' m talking out of turn here but ... you' ve just developed so much and i ...
i just feel that you belong in a world of society and high culture now .
it' s frustrating because you should continue growing , you should be branching out .
there' s paris and rome and the great opera houses and museums .
you should be able to cultivate the right kinds of friends ...
anyway , i , you know ...
biff .
it' s hard , cos ray' s not like that .
he likes watching tv in his underwear , suckin ' a bud .
well , i don' t know what to say .
i can' t ... can' t comment on that .
can i be frank , david ?
mm hm .
sometimes i think i' ve outgrown him .
pretty late .
you too .
what did you do ?
ah , you know , i i , uh , worked late and then may and me had some chinese food .
you and may .
what did you talk about ?
cartoons ?
no , we went up to her apartment and watched " white heat " on tv .
till 3am ?
then we went and got a pizza .
chinese food and a pizza ?
i' m surprised you didn' t break into the pepto bismol factory .
no , frenchy , for the first time in a long time i had fun .
i wanna talk to you , ray .
now ?
david' s going to europe for a month ,
i thought we might go along , see some sights .
what kind of sights ?
churches , opera houses , ruins .
what are you , a stroke victim ?
fly 3, 000 miles to see opera houses and ruins ?
well , i wanna go .
what do you mean ?
it' s part of my development .
you' re frenchy fox from new jersey , stop putting on airs .
david thinks it would be good for me .
i get a bad vibe about him .
you think everybody' s a crook .
i wish i still was a crook , i' d feel like a person .
you haven' t grown along with me .
the only thing that' s grown about you is your rear end .
i' m sorry , ray , i wanna go to europe .
we' re married !
you can' t just go to europe with david .
i asked you to come !
cos you knew i' d say no !
my idea of fun is not going to operas and ruins .
i get enough sleep at home .
i never thought i' d say this , but maybe the time has come to re evaluate our marriage .
if you go with david , you' il have to re evaluate it big time .
i won' t be held back by an over aged juvenile delinquent !
then get yourself a lawyer .
we don' t need lawyers , i' il go 50\ 50 , even though it' s all in my name .
you' re right , we don' t need lawyers because i don' t want anything .
you can have the house , the business , custody of all the chocolate chips , i just want out .
you know , may , it was on a boat that i proposed to frenchy .
yeah , yeah , i know .
suddenly i' m not her type after all these years .
oh , may i tell you something , ray ?
what ?
you' re not my type either .
what ?
what the hell does that mean ?
maybe frenchy wasn' t so wrong to try and make something out of herself .
frenchy overdid everything .
well , you underdo everything .
there' s more to life than turkey meatballs .
i don' t know .
i get a bad vibe about this guy david .
it' s my street instinct , but i don' t trust him .
because he' s younger than you , he' s handsomer than you , he' s much taller than you are , he' s smarter than you , he' s much more exciting than you .
may , don' t pull any punches with me , i can take it .
women ...
you know , women like a little elegance .
it' s more ...
so if i did it again i would do some things differently .
maybe i' d sit through more operas with frenchy .
especially now they got the new sony walkmans .
now you split with frenchy , you don' t even work .
no , i don' t work , but i got an idea for something and i want to talk to you about it .
really ?
wow , what a place .
that' s the home of chi chi potter , the socialite .
now , chi chi' s got a necklace , it' s all emeralds with diamonds around it , it' s a very famous necklace , maybe you saw it in a magazine .
would it have been on tv ?
i don' t know , but it' s been in magazines , it' s famous .
i wanna ...
i could live off that necklace , if i fenced it , for the rest of my life .
remember what happened with the tunnel .
yeah , but we don' t have to tunnel any more .
now , frenchy and i , we' re patrons of the arts so chi chi invited us to a big party ,
frenchy' s out of town , you come with me , we get the necklace .
oh .
i never heisted anything before .
there' s nothing to it , i know where the safe is , i' ve been planning .
' i had dinner there one night and i excused myself ,
' i was very crafty .
' i went upstairs and i scoped it all out
' and found the safe and i got the whole layout in my mind ,
' so i know we can do this . '
i don' t wanna wind up in jail , and if this is such a big item they' il be turning the town upside down looking for it .
no , i have a particularly shrewd mentality ,
i got a connection in chinatown .
i bring in a picture of the necklace , he makes me an exact duplicate , i switch , she never knows .
she' s a ...
chi chi' s a dumb , flighty society dame .
by the time she figures out there' s been a switch ,
i' il be in florida or the cayman islands .
hello ?
what ?
i can' t hear you , what ?
shh .
i' m in a crypt !
i can' t !
what do you mean ?
what are you talking about ?
how ?
give me a break , sister , ok ?
today ? !
shh !
what do you mean it' s an emergency ?
i ...
oh , hi .
mrs winkler ?
we' re sorry to bring you back from your vacation .
what' s goin ' on ?
i' ve terrible news .
something happened to ray ?
sunset enterprises is bankrupt .
how ?
fraud .
fraud ?
who ?
your accountants .
i i i don' t even know who they are .
what ?
you should have looked .
we let them handle everything .
what do i know about running a corporation ?
did you ever read anything you signed ?
no , but they assured us everything was ok .
mrs winkler , do you want a drink ?
i' d like a 1961 romanee saint vivant if we have it .
i' d have a whisky if i were you .
well , i don' t understand , i mean , sunset' s gone ?
can' t we do anything ?
we could put a few people in jail if we could find them .
oh ... this is the worst news .
oh , no .
no , mrs winkler , it' s not .
no ?
it is to me !
no , no , the worst news is coming up .
oh .
all right .
all right , you better tell me .
let me sit down .
they talked about expanding sunset .
that' s right , yeah .
to do that you needed a bank loan , are you aware of that ?
quite a substantial loan .
get to the point .
you signed a promissory note to the bank .
this is exactly what i' ve got accountants for .
yes , but your accountants are in venezuela .
wh ...
this is all so confusing !
you put up your home and savings for a monster loan .
could you put some cyanide in here ?
it needs to be stronger .
you' ve lost it all , frenchy .
or should i say you' ve been swindled out of it all ? .
you mean i got ...
nothing .
you have nothing .
no house , no bank account , just some large , outstanding loans which we feel you can best deal with by filing for bankruptcy .
bankruptcy ?
bankruptcy ?
i' m not up to the " b " words yet .
sorry .
does ray know about this ?
what difference does it make to ray ?
he' s gone .
what did you say ?
i' m bankrupt .
sunset' s gone .
worse , all my personal dough is gone .
the whole ride' s over .
well ...
how could that possibly happen ?
fraud .
my accountants .
ray said not to trust them because the whole firm had moustaches .
i i' m gonna get myself a little valium .
david , i can' t give you that loan i promised you .
what ?
what did you say ?
it turns out i got people i owe .
but you did say i could borrow $400, 000 .
i was using it to cement a deal !
it kills me to cop out on you like this , but i' m busted .
what an idiot .
i guess i am , yeah .
h how could you be so stupid and irresponsible as to allow some patently cheap and thieving accountants to defraud you out of a future ?
how could anyone be that stupid ?
aren' t you a little out of line ?
i' ve made plans , i' ve made commitments to people !
oh .
you got a strange look in your eye , like the guy from the book .
dr jekyil or mr hyde or ted bundy , i can never remember .
the time i' ve put in nurturing an idea that' s not gonna happen .
is that what it was ?
the money ?
i i need my prescription , my little blue pills so i' m gonna ... go and get them .
and i would very much appreciate it if when i came back you were gone .
thank you .
david , i' d like the cigarette case back that i gave you .
i don' t think so .
wow .
i asked you for lessons in life .

you know , don' t bring up anything .
maybe the weather , but don' t ... don' t ...
i' m gonna get in the flow and then kinda glide upstairs .

i wanted a match on sunday but i' il get somebody else .
so sorry .
there' il be rain over the tri state area , and fog .
temperatures will hover in the low 60s till tuesday .
i must say , you are most amusing .
would you like a canape ?
those are shrimp , these are quail eggs , and ...
i don' t have any idea what they are .
thank you , i hate things with toothpicks , they lodge in your throat .
i' m george blint , mutual funds , and you ?
may sloane , i' m a lookout .
i noticed the way you walked and carried yourself from across the room .
you remind me of my wonderful departed wife .
you can' t carry yourself across the room , that' s physically impossible .
you' re charming .
you' re the first woman i' ve met since helen died that i could say that about .
was helen your wife or just a woman who died ?
where' s mr winkler ?
i wanted to talk to him .
oh , he' s mingling .
cloudy today , wasn' t it ?
with a chance of light sprinkles followed by sunshine .
absolutely .
chi chi , would you get those photos in the bedroom ?
i want to show mr winkler the property in aspen .
yes , i just want to talk to dr henske .
he' d be perfect to do beth kramer' s face after the unbelievable job he did on mrs morton' s buttocks .
oh , i' m going to be right back .
would you just ... ?
ray ...
shh !
you scared me .
for god' s sake .
i came to warn you ,
mrs potter' s coming to get some pictures that mr potter wants you to see .
she' s looking for you .
now i' ve closed the safe .
it' s a tough safe , i' m out of practice .
did they see you come up here ?
uh , i don' t think so .
get out there and stand watch .
i' m gonna do this again .
are you ok ?
i' m fine , i' m fine .
get out , get out !
if you could fit it in to your schedule , it would mean so much .
she' s been so down since the divorce and don' t you think he got custody of the pola polas .
chi chi , don' t forget those photographs for mr winkler .
oh , i' il get them .
so , you will try ?
i' il do my best .
kiss kiss .
mrs potter is coming !
she' s gone .
shh !
she' s gone .
mr winkler wouldn' t go without saying goodbye , would he ?
he' s not upstairs .
jesus .
i met a wonderful man downstairs .
he seemed to like me .
he said i reminded him of his wife who' s dead , but i assume he meant when she was alive .
may , can you stop talking while i' m doing this ?
little short fella , bright yellow shirt , unbelievable tie .
oh , yes , i know the gentleman , he was going upstairs before .
are you sure ?
er , yes , um ...
mr winkler .
ray , i hear something .
oh .
ooh !
she' s not feeling well .
she had one of her spells .
spells ?
yes , she gets spells .
we have a doctor ...
no , not necessary .
i i i' m a haemophiliac .
dear god , are you bleeding ?
why would i be bleeding ?
oh , no , she ...
her neck ...
there is , but my nasal passages are clearing up .
on weekends i do this for a hobby .
she had champagne , you know ...
oh , i' il get dr henske .
really ...
ray , you have my cortisone pills ?
me ?
my medication ?
i' il feel better if dr henske looks at her .
you relax and i' il go get dr henske .
a haemophiliac ?
cortisone ?
where do you get this ?
on tv .
i said stay with the weather !
i thought i did some quick thinking !
yes , and you' re going to be examined now !
why ?
i just had a check up .
jesus , i got no time to work here .
they' il be back in seconds .
i can' t tell the difference between these !
then you gotta take ' em both .
i can' t , if they don' t find any necklace ... we' ve been suspiciously seen in here , i' il go right to jail !
especially with your dna !
what has my dna got to do with it ?
you better choose , they' re gonna be back any minute .
i ca ...
i ca ...
ray , let' s go !
oh ...
grrr !
all i know is what i' ve told you , doctor .
she' s right in here .
come along .
here' s dr henske !
what seems to be the trouble ?
false alarm , it was a hot flash .
i think it was menopausal , i' ve seen it before .
i i' m given to occasional spells .
spells ?
not spells , but she ...
no , no !
sometimes for no reason i get hot and cold flashes and the room will spin and spots will flash before my eyes and i' il hear a ringing in my ears ...
you' re making too much of it , may . .. and then my tongue turns black and i can' t swallow .
really ?
they diagnosed parkinson' s but it could be ebola or mad cow disease ...
we got to go ...
it was a false positive , i think .
come on , sweetheart , we' re due .
i do hope you feel better , and not to worry , mr winkler ,
aspen will have to wait .
ebola virus or mad cow ?
i just said the first thing that came into my mouth .
great .
hello , again .
george .
do i still remind you of your wife ?
you kill me , you' re great .
you' re not feeling well , remember ?
i' m taking her home .
i' m in the book , may sloane .
i' il be better .
well , i' il call you .
ray , i just got the news about frenchy .
frenchy ?
didn' t you hear ?
sunset' s gone under .
she was defrauded out of every penny .
i figured you' d know .
yeah .
no , i do know .
i ... i ...
shit .
i came as soon as i heard .
i got exactly what i deserved .
you know , i missed you , frenchy .
i' m sorry i blew our cookie company but i' m even more sorry i blew our marriage .
what are you gonna do ?
everybody makes mistakes .
the important thing is i still love you .
i don' t deserve it , i behaved badly .
you behaved like an ass .
that' s one of those " a " words you used to practise .
ass .
but i' m not the easiest guy in the world .
i' m not mr sensitive .
there' s things i coulda done differently .
we stayed in separate rooms the whole trip , ray , that' s the truth .
so where' s david now ?
he split the second i went bust .
no , i don' t believe it
he was hustling me for the dough .
jeez .
so now we got to begin again , you know ?
and in more ways than one .
you still want me ?
still want you ?
you got to ask a question like that ?
i' m crazy about you .
you' re a goddess to me .
i' m nuts for you .
of course i want ya .
but we' re broke , we haven' t got a dime .
we don' t own a stick of this furniture .
can i show you something ?
may i show you one thing ?
ok ...
just let me ...
i think you' re gonna be very , very proud of me .
that' s chi chi potter' s !
was ...
was chi chi ...
was !
ray !
key word , " was " .
you didn' t ? !
i never felt so great .
i was back in action , i felt alive .
cos i always felt ...
hey , this is glass .
what are you talking about ?
how' s it glass ?
it' s fake .
what ?
how would you know ?
i can tell fake , this ain' t even good fake .
what are you talking about ?
oh , you know , it might fool some idiot with no eye and no brains but it' d never pass with a normal person .
you' re saying i got the phoney ?
i came away with the wrong thing ?
sounds like your mo .
nuts !
i was in the room ...
yeah .
i was gonna substitute the glass one for the real one ...
it' s good to see that you got the same great instincts .
you' re so wrong ...
can i tell you ... ?
what ?
you take those lessons ...
wait , i' m gonna show you something . .. but you know nothing about jewellery .
this is ...
we take this and fence it , go to florida ...
it' s the goods .
that won' t get us on the subway , much less to florida .
you' re such a know everything .
you don' t have to be a rocket scientist to spot a clinker like this .
whoever made it , you overpaid .
what can i do if you' re wrong ?
tell me .
can i take your nose and twist it till you turn blue ?
sure .
gee ...
you broke it .
it' s glass , ray .
i know , but ...
wh ...
eh ...
it' s , well ...
i' m not cleaning it up !
you broke it !
you got glass over everything !
it' s dangerous , you ...
jesus ...
i don' t know what you see in me , i' m such a screw up .
it' s glass !
ray ...
all that matters is that we have each other .
we didn' t there for a while and it made me realise how much i need you .
but you' re married to a loser , frenchy .
no , i' m the luckiest woman in the world .
and the brokest .
we got nothing .
as usual , i come up empty .
we could pawn this .
what is this ?
what is this thing ?
who ... ?
i don' t understand , who' s the duke of windsor ?
we could probably auction it .
where' d you get this ?
from david .
david gave you this ?
he doesn' t know it yet .
i don' t get it , what do you mean ?
hey , it was you who taught me how to open a safe .
i ...
that was one of my fondest memories of our time together .
what are you saying ?
you boosted this from david' s safe ?
frenchy , that' s stealing .
not exactly .
it' s a long story , ray .
let' s sell it .
i' il fill you in on the flight to miami .
sweetheart , you ... are the greatest .
# oh , baby , what i couldn' t do
# with plenty of money and you , ooh
# in spite of the worry that money brings
# just a little filthy lucre buys a lot of things
# and i could take you to places you' d like to go
# but outside of that i' ve no use for dough
# it' s the root of all evil
# of strife and upheaval
# but i' m certain , honey
# that life could be sunny
# with plenty of money and you #
tequila
