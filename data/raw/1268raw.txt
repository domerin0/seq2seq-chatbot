like everybody else .
ladies and gentlemen .
frankie , wake up .
a most distinguished guest would like to say a few words .
would you please welcome senator pat geary of the state of nevada .
and there' s mrs. geary .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
and this is a very , very happy day for me ... and my wife , mrs. geary .
we see nevada far too seldom ... but particularly today ... when we can join with old friends , we can make new friends ... and we help celebrate a young man' s first communion ... and also to thank that boy' s family ... for a magnificent contribution to the state .
i have here in my hand a check ... made out to the university ... and it is a magnificent endowment ... in the name of ...
anthony vito corleone .
and the check is signed by that young man' s parents ... whom i think we should recognize now .
mike , pat , kay
stand up , please .
let the folks see you .
folks , i want you to join with me ... in giving a real nevada thank you ... to mr. and mrs. michael corleone !
we also have , as a special added attraction ... the sierra boys choir ... who have chosen ... a certain special song and a special arrangement ... to honor their host , mr. michael corleone .
boys .
why this feeling why this feeling
why this glow just why this glow
the plaque .
okay , fellas , i got that one .
okay , this is yours .
senator , just you and mrs. corleone .
excuse me .
this is my lawyer tom hagen .
senator geary .
mr. hagen .
he' s the one who arranged this whole thing through your man turnbull .
yes , yes .
sit down .
i was under the impression that you and i would talk alone .
i trust these men with my life , senator .
if i were to ask them to leave , it would be an insult .
it' s all right with me , but i should tell you i am a blunt man ... and i intend to speak very frankly to you ... more frankly than anyone in my position' s talked to you before .
the corleone family has done very well here in nevada .
you own , or you control , two major hotels in vegas ... one in reno .
the licenses were grandfathered in ... so there was no problem with the gaming commission .
but now my sources tell me that ... you plan to make a move against the tropigala .
they tell me that within a week ... you' re gonna move klingman out .
that' s quite an expansion .
however , it will leave you with one little technical problem .
the license will still be in klingman' s name .
turnbull is a good man .
yeah , well , let' s just let' s cut out the bullshit .
i don' t want to spend any more time here than i have to .
you can have the license .
the price is $250, 000 ... plus a monthly payment of five percent of the gross ... of all four hotels ...
mr. corleone .
now , the price for the license is less than $20, 000 .
am i right ?
that' s right .
now , why would i ever consider paying more than that ?
because i intend to squeeze you .
i don' t like your kind of people .
i don' t like to see you come out to this clean country ... in your oily hair ... dressed up in those silk suits ... and you try to pass yourselves off as decent americans .
i' il do business with you , but the fact is that ...
i despise your masquerade ... the dishonest way you pose yourself yourself and your whole fucking family .
senator ... we' re both part of the same hypocrisy ... but never think it applies to my family .
all right , all right .
some people have to play little games .
you play yours .
let' s just say that you' il pay me because it' s in your interest to .
but i want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow .
don' t you contact me again , ever .
from now on , you deal with turnbull .
open that door , son .
senator , you can have my answer now if you like .
my offer is this : nothing .
not even the fee for the gaming license ... which i would appreciate if you would put up personally .
good afternoon , gentlemen .
ladies .
i didn' t know you were out here .
we have to go .
we' re late .
really ?
i' m sorry .
it' s been a delightful party .
thank you for inviting us .
it' s been our pleasure .
it was wonderful talking to you .
fredo , you son ofa bitch !
you look great !
frank pentangeli !
i thought you was never coming out west , you big bum .
i gotta check on my boys , huh ?
what' s with the food around here ?
what' s the matter ?
kid comes up to me in a white jacket ... gives me a ritz cracker and a chopped liver ... he says " canapes .
i said , " can of peas my ass !
that' s a ritz cracker and chopped liver .
bring out the peppers and sausage .
hey , freddie .
seeing you reminds me of new york .
the old days , huh ?
hey , fredo , you remember willi cicci ?
we was with old man clemenza in brooklyn .
we were all upset about that .
heart attack , huh ?
no , there was no heart attack .
that' s what i' m here to see your brother mike about .
but what' s with him ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , what do i gotta do ?
do i have to get ... a letter of introduction to get a sit down ?
you can' t get in to see mike ?

rocco , what' s this ?

anisette .

just tell rocco we' re waiting .
i just left mr. roth in miami .
how' s his health ?
it' s not good .
is there anything i can do , anything i can send ?
he appreciates your concern , michael , and your respect .
that casino you' re interested in , the registered owners are ...
jacob lawrence , allan barclay , both beverly hills attorneys .
the real owners are the lakeville road group from cleveland ... and our friend in miami .
meyer klingman runs the store .
he owns a piece of it too , and he does all right .
but i' ve been instructed to tell you that if you move klingman out ... our friend in miami will go along .
that' s very kind of him .
you tell him that' s greatly appreciated .
hyman roth always makes money for his partners .
one by one , our old friends are gone .
death , natural or not ... prison , deported .
hyman roth is the only one left ... because he always made money for his partners .
my god !
i can' t believe ... out of 30 professional musicians ... there isn' t one ltalian in the group here .
come on .
let' s have a tarantella .

al , would you please get him a drink ?
we' re going to europe .
i' d like to book passage on the queen .
so what do you come to me for ?
why don' t you go to a travel agent ?
we' re getting married first .
the ink on your divorce isn' t dry yet , and you' re getting married ?
you see your children on weekends .
your oldest boy was picked up in reno ... for some petty theft you don' t even know about .
you fly around the world with men who use you like a whore .
you' re not my father !
then what do you come to me for ?
' cause i need money .
i wanna be reasonable with you .
now , why don' t you stay here with us , with the family ?
you can live here on the estate with your kids .
you won' t be deprived of anything .
you can have everything you want .
now , i don' t know this merle .
i don' t know what he does .
i don' t know what he lives on .
tell him marriage is out ofthe question ... and you don' t want to see him anymore .
he' il understand .
believe me .
if you don' t listen to me ... and marry this man ...
you' il disappoint me .
what' s cent' anni ?
cent' anni .
it means a hundred years .
it means we should all live happily for a hundred years , the family .
it' d be true if my father were alive .
merle , you' ve met my sister in law deanna .
fredo' s wife .
a pleasure , merle .
how do you do ?
my pleasure .
what did she mean by that ?
what' s the matter ?
i just wanna dance .
dancing is one thing .
you' re falling all over the floor .
i know what' s the matter .
you' re jealous ' cause he' s a real man .
i swear to god , i' m gonna belt you right in the teeth .
you couldn' t belt your mama .
you know something ?
these dagos are crazy when it comes to their wives .
michael says that if you can' t take care of this ...
i have to .
i think you' d better .
never marry a wop !
they treat their wives like shit !
i didn' t mean to say wop !
stop that !
what are you doing to me ?
you big slob !
help !
i can' t control her , mikey .
you' re my brother , fredo .
you don' t have to apologize to me .
clemenza promised the rosato brothers ... three territories in the bronx after he died .
you took over , and you didn' t give it to them .
i welched ?
you welched .
clemenza promised them " ugatz .
clemenza promised them nothing .
he hated those son ofa bitches more than i do .
frankie , they feel cheated .
you' re sitting high up in the sierra mountains ... and you' re drinking
what' s he drinking , cicci ?
champagne .
champagne cocktails .
and you' re passing judgment on how i run my family .
you' re a good old man .
i like you .
and you were loyal to my father for years .
the rosato brothers , they' re taking hostages .
and mike , they spit right in my face ... all because they' re backed up by that jew in miami .
i know .
that' s why i don' t want ' em touched .
you don' t want ' em touched .
no .
i want you to be fair with them .
you want me to be fair with ' em ?
how can you be fair to animals ?
tom , for christ' s sakes , listen .
they recruit spics .
they recruit niggers .
and they do violence in their grandmothers ' neighborhoods .
and i tell ya , everything with them is whores .
whores and junk .
dope .
and they leave the gambling to last .
now , i wanna run my family without you on my back ... and i want those rosato brothers dead .
now , i have business that' s important with hyman roth .
i don' t want it disturbed .
then you' il give your loyalty to a jew before your own blood ?
come on .
you know my father did business with hyman roth .
he respected him .
your father did business with hyman roth ... your father respected hyman roth ... but your father never trusted hyman roth ... or his sicilian messenger boy johnny ola .
and i want everybody here to know ... there' s not gonna be no trouble from me .
don corleone .
you want him to leave now ?
let him go back to new york .
i' ve already made my plans .
the old man had too much wine .
it' s late .
how' s the baby ?
sleeping inside me .
does it feel like a boy ?
yes , it does , michael .
i' m sorry about all the people today .
bad timing .
it couldn' t be helped , though .
it made me think of what you once told me .
in five years , the corleone family will be completely legitimate .
that was seven years ago .
i know .
i' m trying , darling .
did you see this ?
michael , why are the drapes open ?
kay , you all right ?
yeah .
are you hit ?
no .
it' s over .
it' s over .
now !
shut it off !
hold it !
they' re still on the property .
please , stay inside .
keep them alive .
we' il try .
rocco !
alive !
stay by the door .
check by the boathouse !
yeah , come in .
mike , are you all right ?
yeah .
yeah ?
there' s a lot i can' t tell you , tom .
now , i know that' s upset you in the past .
you felt it was because of some lack of trust or confidence ...
but it' s because i admire you and i love you ... that i kept things secret from you .
that' s why at this moment you' re the only one i can completely trust .
fredo ?
well , he' s got a good heart ... but he' s weak and he' s stupid ... and this is life and death .
tom , you' re my brother .
i always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you .
a real brother .
i know that .
you' re gonna take over .
you' re gonna be the don .
if what i think has happened has happened ...
i' m gonna leave here tonight .
i give you complete power over fredo and his men
rocco , neri , everyone .
i' m trusting you with the lives of my wife and my children the future of this family .
when we catch these guys ... do you think we' il be able to find out who' s back ofall this ?
we' re not gonna catch ' em .
unless i' m very wrong , they' re dead already .
they were killed by somebody close to us .
inside .
very , very frightened they botched it .
yeah , but your people , rocco and neri ... you don' t think that they had something to do with this ?
see , all our people are businessmen .
their loyalty' s based on that .
one thing i learned from pop ... was to try to think as people around you think .
now , on that basis , anything' s possible .
i seen them !
right out my window !
i wanna get out of here !
they' re lying there dead !
get her inside !
over here .
there' s two of' em .
looks like they were hired out of new york .
i don' t recognize ' em .
we won' t get anything out of them now .
fish ' em out .
all right , get rid of the bodies .
where' s mike ?
rocco .
anthony , everything' s gonna be all right .
try to sleep .
did you like your party ?
i got lots of presents .
i know .
did you like ' em ?
i didn' t know the people who gave them to me .
well , they' re my friends .
did you see my present for you ?
it was on my pillow .
anthony , i' m going to be leaving very early tomorrow .
will you take me ?
no , i can' t , anthony .
why do you have to go ?
' cause i have to do business .
i could help you .

i' ve loved baseball ... ever since arnold rothstein fixed the world series in 1919 . ... 47 .
marked down there , say the officials .
and at that point it' il be first and ten
i heard you had some trouble .
it' il be third and ten , another of those big plays now ...
stupid . coming up for s. c.
people behaving like that with guns . ... but it looks like it could stall here .
the important thing is , you' re all right .
good health .
the most important thing .
more than success .
more than money .
now he' s back to pass .
more than power .
rolls up field for hayes .
he' s intercepted .
hurd has it to the lrish 40 .
to the far sideline .
gets by the 45 .
he' s hit and dropped at the s. c. 42 yardline .
notre dame' s first bigbreak of the game .
i came here because there' s gonna be more bloodshed .
i want you to know about it before it happens ... so that there' s no danger of starting another war .
nobody wants another war .
frank pentangeli came to my home and he asked my permission ... to get rid of the rosato brothers .
when i refused , he tried to have me killed .
he was stupid .
i was lucky .
i' il visit him soon .
the important thing is that nothing interfere ... with our plans for the future .
yours and mine .
nothing is more important .
good .
you' re a wise and considerate young man .
and you' re a great man , mr. roth .
there' s much i can learn from you .
what can i do to help , michael ?

thanks .
you' re young .
i' m old and sick .
what we' il do together in the next few months ... will make history , michael .
history .
it' s never been done before .
not even your father would dream that such a thing could be possible .
and pentangeli is a dead man .
you don' t object ?
pickup of four .
he' s small potatoes .
what' s up ?
we got company , huh ?
don corleone , i wish you would' ve let me know you were comin ' .
i could' ve prepared something for you .
i didn' t want you to know i was coming .
you heard what happened in my home ?
mike , i almost died myself .
in my home !
in my bedroom where my wife sleeps !
where my children come and play with their toys .
in my home .
i want you to help me take my revenge .
michael , anything .
what can i do ?
settle these troubles with the rosato brothers .
mike , i don' t understand .
i don' t
i don' t have your brain for big deals ... but this is a street thing .
that hyman roth in miami .
that
he' s backin ' up those son of a bitches .
i know .
then why ?
why do you ask me to lay down to him , mike ?
it was hyman roth that tried to have me killed .
i know it was him .
jesus christ , mike .
jesus christ , look , let' s get ' em all .
let' s hit ' em all now , while we got the muscle .
this used to be my father' s old study .
it' s changed .
i remember there used to be a
a big desk was here .
i remember when i was a kid , frankie ... we had to be very quiet when we played near here .
i was very happy that this house never went to strangers .
first clemenza took it over .
now you .
my father taught me many things here .
he taught me in this room .
he taught me , keep your friends close ... but your enemies closer .
now , if hyman roth sees that i interceded in this thing ... in the rosato brothers ' favor ... he' s gonna think his relationship with me is still good .
that' s what i want him to think .
i want him completely relaxed and confident in our friendship .
then i' il be able to find out who the traitor in my family was .
yeah ?
fredo .
this is johnny .
johnny ola .
we need some more help .
johnny ?
jesus christ , what the hell time is it ?
who is that , honey ?
listen good , fredo .
what are you callin ' me here for ?
i don' t want to talk to you .
pentangeli' s set up a meeting with the rosato brothers .
he' s gonna go for their deal .
oh , god .
will he come alone ?
i don' t know anything .
you got me in deep enough already .
just go along .
everything will be allright , fredo .
pentangeli says he' s willing to make a deal .
all we wanna know is if he' s on the level .
you guys lied to me .
i don' t want you to call me anymore .
your brother' s not gonna find out we talked .
i don' t know what you' re talkin ' about .
who was that ?
uh , wrong number .
frank , i got nobody here .
wait in the car , cheech .
frankie
it' s okay , cheech .
what' s this , rosato ?
a lucky " c " note for our new deal .
richie .
give us a taste , huh ?
yeah , we' re all real happy about your decision , frankie .
you' re not gonna regret it .
i don' t like this " c " note .

i thought i could help you , senator .
hagen ?
listen , hagen , i did not  no .
it' s all right .
i didn' t do anything .
it' s okay .
you' re very lucky .
my brother fredo operates this place .
he was called before anyone .
now , if this had happened someplace else ... we couldn' t have helped you .
when i woke up i was on the floor ... and i don' t know how it happened .
you can' t remember ?
i passed out .
i' il fix it .
okay .
it was just a game .
jesus .
oh .
jesus !
jesus !
jesus god .
oh , god .
i don' t know and i don' t understand why i can' t remember .
you don' t have to remember .
just do as i say .
they' re putting a call in to your office .
explain that you' il be there tomorrow afternoon .
you decided to spend the night ... at michael corleone' s house in tahoe as his guest .
i do remember that she was laughing .
we' d done it before ... and i know that i could not have hurt that girl .
this girl has no family .
nobody knows that she worked here .
it' il be as though she never existed .
all that' s left is our friendship .
yes ?
i' m sorry , mrs. corleone .
we' re not to let you through .
i' m just going to the market .
well , if you' il just give us a list , we' il pick up anything you want .
whose orders are these ?
mr. hagen' s , ma' am .
he' s coming .
all right , well , i' m just gonna have to speak to mr. hagen .
i wanted to explain this , but i had business in carson city .
now , this is michael' s request for your safety .
we can send out for anything .
i see .
i' m supposed to stay in my house .
no , within the compound would be fine .
i was going to take the children to new england next week .
that' s off now .
am i a prisoner ? ls that it ?
that' s not the way we look at it .
all right , come on , kids .
we' re going back to the house .
joe .
cuba !
cuba !
most respected gentlemen ... allow me to welcome you to the city of havana .
i want to thank this distinguished group of american industrialists ... for continuing to work with cuba ... toward the greatest period of prosperity ... in her entire history .
mr. william shaw , representing the general fruit company ;
misters corngold and dant ... of united telephone and telegraph company ;
mr. petty , regional vice president ... of the pan american mining corporation ;
mr. robert allen of south american sugar ; ,
mr. michael corleone of nevada ... representing our associates in tourism and leisure activities ; and my old friend and associate from florida ...
mr. hyman roth .
a solid gold telephone .
perhaps you gentlemen would like to take a look at it .
mr. president .
yes ?
perhaps you would discuss the status of rebel activity ... and what this can mean to our businesses .
of course .
very lovely .
i want to assure you that although the rebels ... have mounted an impressive campaign in las villas ...
my staff indicates with assurance ... we' il drive them out of the city of santa clara before the new year .
and i want to put you all at ease .
we will tolerate no guerillas in the casinos or swimming pools .
he say that they are making arrest ... and in a few minutes he' il let us through .
johnny .
well , i hope my age is correct .
i' m always accurate about my age .
make sure that everybody sees the cake before we cut it .
i' m very pleased ... you were all able to come from such distances ... to be with me today .
when a man comes to this point in his life ... he wants to turn over the things he' s been blessed with turn them over to friends as a reward for the friends he' s had ... and to make sure that everything goes well after he' s gone .
not for years .
hear , hear .
the doctors would disagree , but what do they know ?
these are wonderful things that we' ve achieved in havana ... and there' s no limit to where we can go from here .
this kind of government knows how to help business , to encourage it .
the hotels here are bigger and swankier ... than any of the rough joints we' ve put in in vegas .
and we can thank our friends in the cuban government ... which has put up half of the cash , with the teamsters ... on a dollar for dollar basis ; has relaxed restrictions on imports .
what i' m saying is that we have now what we have always needed : real partnership with a government .
smaller piece .
you all know michael corleone ... and we all remember his father .
at the time of my retirement or death ...
i turn over all my interest in the havana operation ... to his control .
but all of you will share .
the nacionale will go to the lakeville road boys .
the capri to the corleone family .
the sevilla biltmore also .
but eddie levine of newport will bring in the pennino brothers ...
dino and eddie , for a piece ... and also to handle the actual casino operations .
and we' ve saved a piece for some friends in nevada ... to make sure that things go smooth back home .
i want all of you to enjoy your cake ... so enjoy .
happy birthday .
happy birthday .
i saw an interesting thing happen today .
a rebel was being arrested by the military police ... and rather than be taken alive ... he exploded a grenade he had hidden in his jacket .
he killed himself , and he took a captain of the command with him .
right, johnny ?
those rebels , they' re lunatics .
yes , i agree .
maybe so .
but it occurred to me ... the soldiers are paid to fight , the rebels aren' t .
what does that tell you ?
they could win .
this country has had rebels for the last 50 years .
it' s in their blood .
i' ve been coming here since the ' 20s .
we were running molasses out of havana when you were a baby ... the trucks owned by your father .
michael .
i' d rather we talked about this when we we' re alone .
the two million never got to the island .
i wouldn' t want it to get around that you held back the money ... because you had second thoughts about the rebels .
ah , sit down , michael .
sit down .
if i could only live to see it , to be there with you .
ohh .
what i wouldn' t give for ... 20 more years .
here we are , protected free to make our profiits without kefauver ... the goddamn justice department and the fbl 90 miles away , partnership with a friendly government .
ninety miles .
it' s nothing .
just one small step , looking for a man ... that wants to be president of the united states ... and having the cash to make it possible .
michael ... we' re bigger than u. s. steel .
mikey , how are ya ?
okay ?
hiya .
freddie corleone .
jesus christ , what a trip .
the whole time i' m thinkin ' ...
what if somebody knows what i got in here ?
imagine that .
two million dollars on the seat next to me .

i loved him and trusted him .
later on he had an idea ... to build a city ... out of a desert stopover for g. i. s on their way to the west coast .
that kid' s name was moe green ... and the city he invented was las vegas .
this was a great man ... a man of vision and guts ... and there isn' t even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him ... in that town .
someone put a bullet through his eye .
no one knows who gave the order .
when i heard it i wasn' t angry .
i knew moe ; i knew he was headstrong .
talking loud , saying stupid things .
so when he turned up dead ...
i let it go ... and i said to myself ...
this is the business we' ve chosen .
i didn' t ask ... who gave the order ... because it had nothing to do with business .
