another year , a brand new diary .
once again i was summoned , kicking and screaming , to my mother' s turkey curry buffet , where i' ve had some of the most shaming experiences of my life .
hello , darling .
lovely to see you .
it was , as usual , crammed full with some of the most dangerous perverts in the uk , disguised as close , personal friends of my parents .
hello , bridget .
hello , una .
oh , no , thanks .
love the jumper .
i prefer what' s underneath it .
uncle geoffrey !
hello , gorgeous .
hello .
hello , darling .
hello , dad .
how' s it going ?
i wish i was dead .
but this year , there was one crucial difference .
nice jumper .
my mother' s taste never falters .
never .
you always wonder how it' s going to work out at the end of the story .
marla and captain von trapp ,
snow white and the seven dwarfs ,
mark darcy and bridget jones .
i' ve found my happy ending at last .
and nothing in the world can spoil it .
well , almost nothing .
bridget jones , what the fuck are you doling ?
i , i can' t see anywhere soft to land .
how about on your arse ?
bridget , unless you want to get sacked at 6, 000 feet , you will be on your way in exactly three seconds .
three , two , one ... cue bridget .
a dangerous bane to the countryside and emergency services , or a safe and exhilarating hobby ?
well ... let' s see , shall we ?
go .
jump .
for christ s sakes , go !
she' s out .
unit two , you got her ?
we see her .
bridget , open the chute .
open it .
open your fucking parachute !
pull the thingy or you will die !
oh .
honestly , you forget just one teeny , weeny detail and everyone treats you like an idiot .
# nobody does it better
# makes me feel sad for the rest
# nobody does it
# half as good as you
# baby , baby
# darling , you' re the best
# baby , you' re the best ...
where was i ?
oh , yes ...
mark darcy .
what happens after you walk off into the sunset ?
bridget ?
earth to bridget sodding jones .
bridget , you' re on .
you' re live .
well , this is bridget jones for sit up britain , reporting to you from a big vat of excrement .
give me a close up of the porker .
who cares about the odd professional hiccup ?
i' ve been in a functional relationship with an adult male for six wonderful weeks , four fabulous days and seven precious hours .
or to put it another way , 71 ecstatic shags .
he' s given up being snooty , and i' ve given up smoking .
# loving you ...
well , he thinks i have anyway , which is practically the same thing . # ... a dream come true ...
mark darcy is perfect .
not a fuckwit , alcoholic , workaholic , pervert or megalomaniac , but total sex god and human rights lawyer .
he is a miracle , really .
bridget , will you stop ?
stop staring at me .
go and find something to do .
sorry .
# la la la la la ...
so , as you can see , the incredible truth is the wilderness years are over .
bridget jones is a love pariah no more .
morning , bridget .
late again .
yes .
sorry .
i was in bed with my boyfriend .
he' s a human rights lawyer , you know .
yes , we know .
i cannot believe how fantastic shagging was last night .
maybe i' il ring him .
no , no ...
obviously it' s important to tell one' s boyfriend how nice he looks naked , but i have crucial , pulitzer prize winning journalism to do .
hello ?
it' s me .
just wondered how you are .
i' m fine , thanks .
everything all right with you ?
fine , though , er ...
i' ve just had a rather graphic shag flashback .
and you do have a genuinely gorgeous bottom .
thank you .
i' m with the mexican ambassador , the head of amnesty international and the undersecretary for trade and industry .
and you' re on speakerphone .
oh .
right , well ...
i' m quite busy with important stuff too ...
bridget , we' re waiting for that tape about tom , the happy hamster .
i' il call when i' ve finished .
excellent .
and richard wants to see you about that crap skydiving report .
oh , fuck .
oh , dear .
is this the end of my career ?
no , it can' t be .
i will fight this .
i am a journalist of the highest standards and integrity .
this is bridget jones reporting from a big vat of excrement .
look , i never said i could skydive and i' m terrified of heights ,
so it was really hard to concentrate .
be quiet .
they loved it upstairs .
loved it .
and they want us to come up with another regular spot for you .
oh , my god .
that' s ...
i won' t let you down , richard .
precisely . ... my friends ' motto was " when in rome , do as many romans as you can .
but if your tastes are marginally more highbrow , i also have tips .
forget the forum , definitely forget the coliseum , no fun now they can' t slaughter christians .
forget the sistine chapel , first example of a poof interior designer gone mad ...
what is daniel oleaver doing on the television ?
it' s called the smooth guide .
making culture bearable " . ... equally serene and equally beautiful professore giovana dabrache .
who is about to show me her diptych .
same old creep .
oh .
shame .
he always speaks very warmly of you .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
how about we go out for a bite to eat tonight ?
oh .
can t .
i have to go out with my boyfriend .
he' s a human rights lawyer .
i know .
i' m meeting him for a romantic supper .
oh .
bridget jones .
bridget , it' s mark .
oh .
i was just talking about you .
i' m running late .
do you want me to cancel ?
oh .
no , that' s fine .
are you sure ?
be as late as you like .
chuck him , while you' re not pregnant with his unwanted child .
i only said he was working late .
in one hour , he' il be coming in his secretary' s mouth while he rings to say what he wants for starters .
friends spend years finding you a boyfriend , then instantly tell you to dump him .
even if he isn' t shagging her already , he' s thinking about it .
a man dating a woman with large breasts will bed one with small breasts .
rubbish .
mark' s above all that nonsense .
jellyfisher alert .
jellyfisher alert .
janey osborne .
talking to her is like swimming in a sea and being stung repeatedly by an enormous jellyfish .
bridget .
how' s it going with that divine man of yours ?
you must be so pleased to have a boyfriend at last .
first jellyfish of the evening .
is he taking you to the law council dinner ?
oh .
well , i' m sure he' s just forgotten .
better start slimming into that dress .
he' s given you the night off to cheer up your single friends .
sweet .
actually , he' s got a big case on , trying to get everyone in mexico out of prison .
we' re meeting for a very late romantic dinner .
really ?
that' s so odd ,
' cause i saw him an hour ago going into his house with rebecca gillies .
she' s only 22 .
she' s got legs up to here .
and daddy owns half of australia .
see ya , babes .
who is rebecca gillies ?
what' s she doing going into my boyfriend' s house ?
where he never asks me .
and with legs up to here ?
my legs only come up to there .
you have fine legs .
climber s legs .
i say go over there and ask him , straight out , are you or are you not sleeping with rebecca gillies ?
if he says ...
i won' t dignify that with an answer ...
then you know he' s shagging her .
# all that i have is all that you' ve given ...
it' s all about confidence and trust .
mark would never betray me .
everything will be lovely and we' il have sex in the kitchen .
oh , god .
i' m coming .
oh , god !
what is that ?
two seconds , i' il be straight down .
who is that ? # ...
i find you lied
# and i can' t believe it' s true
# wrapped in her arms i see you across the street
# i see you across the street
# and i can' t help but wonder if she knows what' s going on
# you talk of love but don' t know how it feels
# when you realise
# you' re not the only one
let' s get on with it . # ... oh , you better stop
# stop # before
# you tear me all apart
# you better stop
# stop ...
you are a very demanding man . # ... you go and break my heart ...
bridget jones .
no , i' m bridget jones .
that' s what i meant .
you must be ...
rebecca gillies .
i' ve been so looking forward to meeting you
after everything mark' s told me .
why ?
what' s he said ?
where is mark ?
actually , er ...
becky , who is it ?
becky ?
right .
great .
right ...
bridget .
hello , mark .
hello ...
lawyers who work with mark .
good evening .
everything under control , i see .
um ...
excellent graph .
lovely legs .
thank you .
i am so sorry .
i thought ...
oh , i don' t know what i thought .
now you' re really angry with me .
no , i' m not .
it' s ok , you can say if you are .
it' s not the end of the world .
i' il get you a glass of wine .
the thing is i ran into janey osborne , who said she' d just seen you with this girl , with really long legs , and shazzer and jude said i should get over here straightaway .
following the orders of the dating war command , you executed a raid .
you are angry .
i' m not , just disappointed .
disappointed ?
oh , god , that' s worse than angry .
i' m just disappointed i can' t take you home this instant .
oh .
what about all those lawyers ?
oh , plenty of time to butter them up at the law council dinner next friday .
don' t want to go , do you ?
i' d love to .
oh , stupid bridget , stupid friends .
wonderful , loyal mark darcy ... ... who loves me just the way i am .
what are you doing ?
getting dressed .
why are you dancing around in that tent ?
because i don' t want you to see any of my wobbly bits .
that' s pointless , because i have a very high regard for your wobbly bits in all circumstances .
really ?
absolutely .
i think it' s high time we had another look .
# yeah
# are you digging on me ?
# yeah
# i' m digging on you , now , baby
# yeah
# do you want a little bit of my love ?
# yeah ...
he really is very , very , very nice .
# all the time i knew
# that you loved me
# and you promised me ...
i miss you too .
# that you would be my only man
# yeah
# are you digging on me ?
i' ve never been happier in my entire life .
however , must not obsess or fantasise .
bridget darcy .
mrs darcy .
mr and mrs darcy .
lord and lady darcy .
wonder what mark darcy would be like as a father .
to his children , i mean , not to me .
that would be a weird , oedipus like thought .
at last , life is on track .
fiance , wife ... mother .
bugger .
ever fancied doing it in the dark with a total stranger ?
all right , perhaps not a total stranger .
back off , oleaver , or i' il report you to a sexual harassment tribunal .
i' m a serious journalist .
is that your most serious skirt , jones ?
oh ...
do you like it ?
i thought you hated television .
i hate watching television .
being on it is ...
hello there . ... entirely different .
daniel , thought the madrid piece was outstanding , really original .
cheers , jeremy .
appreciate that .
we had to work really hard on that one .
tosser .
talking of which , how is mark darcy ?
you still ... ?
yes , i am .
and i intend to be for a very long time .
good .
you know what a fan i am of any woman married to mark darcy .
that' s not funny .
seriously , though , jones , speaking purely unselfishly , i worry about you .
you do know that it' s a fact that most lawyer' s wives die of boredom ?
and what about you ?
still shagging anything that moves ?
as a matter of fact , no .
no shagging whatsoever .
i' m in shag therapy .
it turns out i have a problem .
i go to meetings , talk about my feelings .
hug people who smell .
i don' t believe you .
i' m trying ... ... to be a better man , bridge , so that the next time a better woman comes along ,
i won' t make a pig' s ear of it .
daniel .
meeting ?
yeah , yeah .
thanks .
very good hair , jones .
by the way , um , you' re not free for dinner tonight , are you ?
no , i' m not .
i' m going to the law council dinner .
it' s a very important evening .
i can' t wear that .
bridge , do you want to get married and have babies before you become barren ?
trust me ...
my only grown up friend .
married to mark' s partner .
she actually got engaged on the night of the law council dinner .
try it with the dress .
oh , my god !
remember , we are trying to reduce your body size by 15 per cent .
you hold the front , i' il hold the back .
one , two , three ...
what' s going on in there ?
not too bad , actually .
tra la !
fantastic .
right , let us begin .
i am going to make you into a princess .
goody .
nothing like being in the hands of a total genius .
wow .
whatever you do ...
bugger it . ... don' t iron your hair .
it' s a lot worse than i thought .
we could flatten it with brylcreem .
what about a wig ?
lawyers love wigs .
i preferred you in the gold .
no , whatever you do , not the gold .
great .
i' m late with mad hair and can barely breathe in scary knickers .
# la la la la la la la la ...
oh , god .
i' m very worried .
what if someone says " bridget jones , get out of here , you are ridiculous " ?
stop it .
the most important thing , of course , is to look absolutely wonderful and make a magnificent entrance .
# i just can' t get you out of my head ...
hi .
sorry i' m late .
hello .
i think you should go to the ladies .
but i went before i left home .
trust me on this one .
oh .
not good .
all right , tiny make up mistake , but i always have wit and conversation to fall back on .
thank you .
bridget .
hello .
derek , horatio , camilla .
horatio ?
yes , horatio .
horatio was just saying he' s totally against charitable giving .
what ?
well , obviously you don' t mean it .
absolutely .
do you think it' s helpful to give a beggar fifty pence ?
maybe he' s just hungry .
don' t be so naive .
the people you see outside the tube every day are there by choice .
end of story .
oh , no , it' s not .
some people have terrible personal problems , and other people might have lost their family in some tragic ferry disaster .
and some people are just plain hopeless .
honestly , this is the sort of rubbish you' d expect from fat , balding
tory , home counties , upper middle class twits .
yeah , very good .
tested my resolve .
how did i do ?
you seem to have made quite an impression .
i' ve put you next to giles benwick .
oh , i' m not sitting next to you ?
no .
he' s terribly nice , but his wife' s just run off with one of the partners .
he probably won' t mention it , but you should know .
i always knew she was out of my league .
you see , there' s the high fliers , like annabel and mark darcy and there' s the gorgeous girls , like rebecca there and there' s the rest of us .
like you and me , you mean ?
absolutely .
i mean , look at the state of us .
you and me stumbled into the vlp room by mistake and it' s only a matter of moments before they show us the door .
my lords , ladies and gentlemen , let the quiz begin .
oh , goody .
i love quizzes .
all those years of playing trivial pursuits are about to pay off .
now i want to see your hands poised over those bells .
ready ?
here we go .
what are something called " customary freeholds " ?
superior copyhold .
yes .
what is the correct grace used in the inner temple for the second mooting night of michaelmas term ?
amas bibendo ... fructis .
jolly good .
what is an overreaching conveyance ?
what is rack rent ?
when was breach of promise abolished ?
define " damnum sentit dominus " .
translate " reddendo singula singulis " into ancient greek .
i believe this is the answer .
hippodamoi credemnon louestai .
absolutely correct .
now , for our final and deciding round , the category is contemporary culture .
who did the design for princess diana' s wedding dress ?
the emmanuels .
correct .
excellent , bridget .
name the character in footballers ' wives who , in one memorable episode , set fire to her own breasts .
chardonnay .
correct .
at this point , there are only two tables in contention and only one question left .
what was the name of madonna' s first uk single ?
lucky star .
sorry , i didn' t quite hear .
are you sure ?
wasn' t it holliday ?
no , everyone thinks it is , but it' s not .
my entire life has been leading up to this very moment .
take that knife , slice off my head and boil it if i' m wrong .
the correct answer is lucky star .
no .
the correct answer is ...
is it holliday ?
holliday , indeed , yes .
the winners of the 42nd annual law council quiz are ... the legal eagles .
lovely to see you , bridget .
oh , thanks , rebecca .
good night .
why didn' t you speak to me all night ?
that' s the point of those dinners .
but you talked to rebecca .
and you talked to horatio .
i' il never fit in with your friends .
not if you go on calling everyone " balding , upper middle class twits " .
well , they were balding , upper middle class twits .
except for the ones who had hair .
i suppose you agree with them that poor people deserve to be poor ?
don' t be ridiculous .
so now i' m ridiculous ?
yes , tonight you were a little .
well , tonight you were an arrogant arse .
i think i may have made a mistake inviting you and your folding underpants into my life .
good night .
if you had asked me tonight ,
i' d have said no , anyway .
asked you what ?
bridget ?
asked you what ?
oh , god , i' ve done it .
i' ve gone and done it .
one minute , you' re closer to someone than anyone in the whole world , next minute , you' re never going to see them again .
if you have a message for mark darcy , please speak after the tone .
hello , it' s me .
i' m really , really sorry ...
sorry , it' s the door .
don' t go away , i have something really , really important to say .
yes , who is it ?
it' s me .
mark .
oh , right .
er , just a moment .
i' m on the phone .
you' re outside .
look , er ...
i' il ring you later .
unless you' ve come to chuck me once and for all .
in which case , bye and thank you , and ... sorry .
oh , god , please don' t chuck me .
if you have chucked me , please change your mind ,
i' il behave much better in future .
on the other hand , if you haven' t , please behave better next time we go out .
stuck up snob .
what do you want ?
i' d like to come up .
you are , after all , my girlfriend .
even though i shouted at you and called you an arrogant arse ?
unfortunately , yes .
you see , the problematic thing is ...
i love you .
w what ?
i said i love you .
i' m sorry , i missed that again .
i said i love you , for god' s sake !
all right , no need to shout .
i' il come down and let you in .
you might be needing this in the future .
he said he loves me .
he said he loves you ?
he said he loves me .
right , where is he now ?
he' s in the bedroom .
go back in there , bridge , and whatever you do , act completely nonchalant .
bridget , you' re staring at me again .
sorry .
listen , i know this evening didn' t go exactly as planned , but there was a very important question i wanted to ask you tonight .
oh , really ?
yes .
i' ve actually been meaning to ask this for quite some time .
i' ve just never really found the right way to put it .
darling bridget ... ... would you ... ... like to go on a skiing mini break ?
yes !
# what the world ...
this is not just a mini break .
this is a holiday in heaven .
told a tiny lie about being an extremely experienced skier .
but , honestly , how hard can it be ?
ah .
shall we ?
very romantic , very relaxing .
bar going up .
no .
what ?
why ?
um ...
er ...
oh .
oh , god .
oh , god .
oh .
ah .
bridget .
rebecca .
what are you doing here ?
didn' t mark tell you we were coming ?
no , he didn' t .
it was me who recommended the place .
i' ve been coming since i was 11 .
really ?
three whole years .
come on , up you get .
come on .
there you go .
are you all right ?
yes , fine , thanks .
you sure ?
why is rebecca here ?
oh , god .
well , i mentioned that we were coming and she said why didn' t they come too , and i couldn' t say no , could i ?
come on , you two , let' s crack on , shall we ?
actually , i might just sit this one out .
you head on .
see you down there .
you sure ?
absolutely .
i' il be fine in a minute .
right , i' il see you at base camp , then .
bastard .
i can' t believe he' s left me .
ooh .
oooh .
so , romantic getaway has turned into lawyer' s reunion .
oooh .
i can' t believe we' re already into group holidays after only eight weeks of total , undisturbed sex .
walt a minute ...
no .
eight weeks ?
it couldn' t be , could it ?
totally undisturbed ...
oh , god .
i' m pregnant .
and going to die !
oh , my god !
i can' t see !
big bump !
get out of the way !
who' s this ?
an eccentric but exhilarating performance from a total unknown , who' s now solidly in position for the bronze .
i would like a pregnancy test , please .
a pregnancy test .
ich bien , er , possibly ... mit baby .
er ...
kinder !
i am on back ... and he , er ... maken ze lieben .
er , with me .
she' s pregnant !
oh , no !
no , no , not pregnant .
she' s bloated .
condom ?
nein .
nein , nein .
maybe like this , but maybe like this .
i think her problem is psychological .
there is nothing a pill can do to help her .
i' m a girl and i met a boy .
fraulein , and i met frau ... boy .
and possibly now mit baby , uh huh ?
right , moment of truth awaits .
what if i am pregnant ?
i must try not to get hopes up too high .
boyfriend and baby seems just too lucky .
bridget ?
i have been looking everywhere for you .
i thought you' d broken a leg or something ...
oh , god .
you' re not ... ?
i might be .
what if i were ?
well , i suppose i' d ...
to be quite frank , it' d be bloody fantastic .
i mean , if a little ahead of schedule .
are you really pregnant ?
well , give it three minutes .
what do you fancy ?
boy or a girl ?
i dunno , it doesn' t matter .
although , i suppose i' ve always had the fantasy of a son .
another mark darcy .
or maybe something like huck .
or river .
or some fabulous hebrew name like noah .
anyway , i could teach him to play cricket and rugby and visit him at eton on st andrew' s day .
eton ?
yes .
the darcy men have been going to eton for five generations .
well , my son' s not going to be sent away from home .
especially to some fascist institution where they stick a poker up your arse that you' re never allowed to remove again .
i see .
i didn' t mean you .
no , of course not .
so what' s the alternative ?
sleeping in his parents ' bed , breastfeeding until he' s a teenager and some progressive school , where the day is spent singing yellow submarine ?
oh , you' re absolutely right .
it' s madness to allow a child to enjoy his education or live with his parents .
what is madness is to have a child if his parents can' t have a discussion without one shouting at the other .
it' s negative .
that' s too bad .
yes , very sad .
perhaps we should go out for lunch tomorrow .
get out of the grump .
that' s a good idea in theory , but you made a family arrangement .
oh , god .
darlings !
i' ve had the fabulous idea of inviting your parents .
another one of mother' s culinary triumphs .
everything in miniature .
mini treacle tart , admiral darcy ?
no , no , thank you .
the mini spotted dick rather finished me off .
so , mark , bridget , when are you two lovebirds going to name the day ?
bridget , you must want to hear those ding dong bells .
well , we' re certainly not thinking about that yet .
are we , bridget ?
no .
god , no .
of course not .
good .
well , that' s that sorted .
so , admiral , out on the high seas .
how was it ?
did you mean that thing you said ?
what thing ?
you know what thing .
no , i don' t know what thing .
the thing thing .
now , let' s see , there are any number of things , um ... in an afternoon full of all sorts of things , so i , um ...
the thing where you said you' re not , um ...
that you' re not , not even thinking about , um ...
what' s the matter ?
let' s get a drink .
i' m going to go to the loo , then i' m going to come back .
and then we' re going to be civilised .
if you have a message for mark darcy , speak after the tone .
mark , it' s rebecca .
are you there ?
obviously not .
probably still out with bridget .
um ...
anyway , i hope lunch with the parents went well .
i' m sure you were dutiful and very polite , as usual .
er ...
whatever .
anyway , look , maybe give me a ring when you get back .
i thought i might pop round for a nightcap .
but i suppose that' s a silly idea .
bridget' s probably there .
sleep tight .
oh , christ , what now ?
are you or are you not having an affair with rebecca gillies ?
i won' t dignify that question with an answer .
right .
all i did was go to the loo .
bridget !
bridget .
that' s not your coat .
oh , right .
oh , bridget , what are you doing ?
i read you should never date someone if you can think of three reasons not to .
can you think of three ?
yes .
which are ?
well , first off , i embarrass you .
i can' t ski , i can' t ride , i can' t speak latin .
my legs only come up to here and yes , i will always be a little bit fat .
and you , you fold your underpants before you go to bed .
now , hang on , that can' t be a reason .
no , it' s not a reason .
but you' re not perfect either .
you look down your nose at absolutely everyone , and you' re incapable of doing anything spontaneous or potentially affectionate .
it feels like you' re waiting to find someone in the vlp room who' s , who' s so fantastic ... just the way she is , that you don' t need to fix her .
bridget , this is mad .
perhaps you' ve already found her .
do you want to marry me ?
look , i ...
you see , you can never muster the strength ... to fight for me .
i can' t believe i did that .
# what do i gotta do to make you love me ?
# what do i gotta do to make you care ?
# what do i gotta do when lightning strikes me
# hmm
# and i wake to find that you' re not there ?
# what do i gotta do to make you want me ?
# hmm
# what do i gotta do to be heard ?
# and what do i say when it' s all over , babe ?
# oooh ooh
# and sorry seems to be the hardest word
# it' s sad so sad
# why can' t we talk it over , babe ?
# always seems to me
# when sorry seems to be
# the hardest word #
five weeks later .
4, 000 pounds .
am enjoying a relationship with two men simultaneously .
the first is called ben , the other , jerry .
zero .
you have absolutely no messages .
not a single one .
not even from your mother .
hello ?
hello , darling .
you haven' t forgotten our lunch date ?
of course i have .
i' m suicidally depressed .
don' t be silly , bridget .
meet me at debenhams at twelve o' clock .
mum ...
i thought we were going to have something to eat .
patience , please .
i' ve got a big surprise for you , darling .
what ?
don' t say " what " , say " pardon " .
tra la !
what do you think ?
oh , my god .
daddy and i are getting married .
you' re already married .
we' re doing it again .
reaffirming our vows .
you are going to be a bridesmaid , and absolutely everything is going to be lavender .
and when i say everything , i mean ... ... everything .
oh , god , i' m never going to get married and my sodding mum and dad are doing it twice .
# no more candlelight no more romance
# no more small talk ...
bloody know it all .
the big , juicy apple .
the city that never sleeps with the same person two nights running .
my favorite place in america , where sex and the city isn' t just a programme ,
it' s a promise .
morning , rach .
sorry .
oh , cheer up , misery guts .
i have good news for you .
sure , right .
what' s the angle ?
i interview some rocket scientist while he looks through my skirt with x ray glasses ?
no .
although that is a bloody good idea .
no .
the fact is the smooth guide is doing very well with women , but the network want us to cast a wider net and use a smooth guide ess .
me ?
with daniel oleaver ?
it' s the next logical step .
i think thailand is first on the list .
no .
i won' t do it .
not now .
not in a million years from now .
excuse me ?
i am a top television journalist , not some boorish bint in a bikini .
really ?
strong words from somebody who doesn' t know where germany is .
who told you that ?
oleaver .
he said he couldn' t be expected to go out with someone who thought iran was david bowie' s wife , and who didn' t know where germany was .
daniel oleaver is a deceitful , sexist , disgusting specimen of humanity , that i wouldn' t share a lift with , let alone a job .
come on , jones , there must have been something you liked about me .
well ... you have a nice car .
and quite nice manners .
outside the bedroom .
but that' s about it .
and by the way , i know exactly where germany is .
the question is do you know the location of your arsehole ?
as a matter of fact , i do know the exact location of my arsehole .
and hers .
oh , come on , jones , it was just a silly joke .
not a very funny one .
go on , then .
what ?
where is it ?
where is germany ?
next to france .
and ?
and also belgium ...
poland .
and it has a sea coast .
which sea ?
oh , sod it .
now , look ,
i think we should talk about finch' s suggestion .
i am going to thailand , jones .
wouldn' t you like to be my little girl guide ?
thailand ?
you' il shag before you leave heathrow .
i' il be perfectly fine .
i' m eschewing all men .
and cigarettes .
and carbohydrates .
we can' t possibly let you go .
on your own .
oh , stop it , all of you .
i am a mature , sophisticated , professional woman and i' m going to thailand entirely on my own , thank you very much .
fuck !
sorry .
fuckity fuck .
sorry .
and now our final passengers have joined us , we can get underway .
someone' s gotta be last .
are we not sitting together ?
oh , fuck .
i don' t think we' re really in a position to , um ... ... make a fuss .
sorry .
hi .
sorry .
what' s our film ?
what' s your name ?
mine' s olive .
er , bridget .
good afternoon again , ladles and gentlemen .
we' re about to offer a wide range of duty free items .
details can be found in your in flight magazine .
wonderful people , the thais .
particularly the young ladies .
if you know what i mean , eh ?
oh , for heaven' s sake .
come with me .
come with me now .
where are we going ?
just through here .
thank you .
this is worse than school .
it really wasn' t my fault .
it' s a fizzy drink , you know , it just ...
it just sort of fizzied over .
couldn t bear to think of you back there in slum class , jones .
graham , thank you .
you are the best air steward i' ve ever come across .
and if i may say so , the smartest .
thank you , sir .
i thought you were there already , doing research .
fuck , no .
i make it up as i go along .
it' s 13 hours for this trip .
i need some in flight entertainment .
why don' t you tell me , in detail , about your school netball tour , particularly the unsavoury incident in the communal showers .
i didn' t play netball .
or go to a girls ' school .
or have showers .
now that' s just not true , is it ?
let me start you off .
no .
if you' re gonna be dull , i' m going to plunge back into mrs dalloway , and you know how she loves that .
dirty , dirty bitch .
# here' s a new thing
# that' s gonna please ya
# just a little town down in indonesia
# bangkok ...
arrived bangkok .
very hot .
relieved at last to throw myself into serious journalistic work .
thailand has long called travellers from around the globe to take spiritual succour and karmic rest .
for centuries , western visitors have been inevitably drawn to some of bangkok' s oldest sanctuaries .
so true , bridget .
even i , fight it as i may , am no exception .
the moment i arrive here , i almost feel an irresistible pull ... ... to this .
the temple of tranquillity .
indeed , nothing symbolises thailand' s extraordinary fusion of east and west , of tradition and innovation , better than this .
fully body to body massage .
sawatdee kha ?
sawatdee khrab ?
an incredible thing about thailand is the amazing traditional cuisine .
i' m going to taste kapaluk , the ultimate delicacy .
oh , fuck !
oh , fuck !
oh , my god .
my god .
um ...
er ...
mmm .
how about a lovely locust ?
i can' t .
no , no , i can' t .
they' re delicious .
oh !
now that is ko panyi , which is the setting for a very famous thai poem , which i think you' d like very much , jones .
it' s all about a badly behaved prince who finds true love with a beautiful , and as it happens , very slightly overweight princess .
you' re teasing me .
i never tease about poetry .
oh , suvarnamali why can you not see that i adore you ?
why do you avoid and scorn me ?
if you cast me off and leave me
how should i live another day ?
and you thought all i knew of thailand was pussies and ping pong balls .
you wouldn' t sleep with him ?
no , of course not .
absolutely not .
but he is clever .
yes ?
and handsome .
he' s also a dysfunctional , fucked up , middle aged , lost boy .
well , no one' s perfect .
i didn' t realise you were busy .
he' s young enough to be your grandson .
i know .
isn' t that great ?
come on , guys , i' ve got a very special treat lined up for lunch .
i' m getting rather fond of jed , and i must say he has a genuine interest in thai cuisine .
i wouldn' t have thought omelette would be big in thailand .
or mushrooms , for that matter .
it' s magic .
it is a magic mushroom omelette , isn' t it ?
well , that' s awful .
there is nothing funny in this at all .
although , thank god , the mushrooms don' t actually seem to be working .
# just what is it that you want to do ?
such lovely colours !
# we wanna get loaded and we wanna have a good time ...
beautiful bridget !
beautiful bridget !
beautiful bridget !
bridget jones !
bridget jones !
but , wait ...
bridget jones ?
what sound is that ?
it is daniel oleaver .
how unutterably beautiful he is .
jones , what the hell are you doing ?
you are lovely colours . # i don' t wanna lose your love ...
here .
here i am .
i think you' re completely off your face .
hey .
bloody hell .
oh ...
oh , i' m an angel .
oh .
how lovely .
glorious sand .
oh .
i want to be naked .
naked as a baby .
come on , then , angel .
up you get .
all right ?
mmm .
how are you feeling ?
completely embarrassed .
don' t be .
you' re charming on drugs .
in future , just say yes .
do you know , i never really understood why you wanted to go out with me .
it seemed so unlikely .
come on .
for god' s sake .
you' re sexy .
you make me laugh .
at you , of course , not with you .
and you were ... ... incidentally ... ... the best shag ... ... i ever had .
the best ?
aside from simon reade in the fifth form locker room , yeah .
suppose i said you were pretty good too ?
pretty good ?
was i better than mark darcy ?
by the way , is it true he always says " i' m sorry , i think i' m going to come " ?
who told you that ?
it' s common knowledge , isn' t it ?
come on , jones .
who gave who the hoof ?
and why ?
let' s just say that we suffered from a fatal incompatibility .
i have missed you , jones .
i don' t suppose there' s any circumstances in which you would ever consider thinking about trusting me again ?
absolutely not .
well , i suppose i' il be getting back to my little hut now .
thank you very much , daniel .
i had a nice time .
is that the big dipper or the little one ?
i can never tell them apart .
definitely the big one .
you can' t see the little one this close to the equator .
oh , please .
you don' t know about astronomy .
i most certainly do .
i' m passionate about it .
you know , jones , if stargazing is something that interests you , then it has to be said that the view from my balcony is quite outstanding .
perhaps you' d like to come up and have a little look ?
i don' t think so .
see over there ?
along my arm .
that' s it , over there .
that is orion' s belt .
and next to that is a very sexy little constellation called ursa' s maiden .
ah .
she' s being very naughty and trying to undo orion' s belt .
all right , what about ... that one ?
yes , well that is a very , very famous star .
um , right next to , of course , um ...
i don' t know , some other fucking star that' s been there for years and years .
seen one star , you' ve seen the lot , that' s what i say , jones .
different with girls , though .
some girls ... ... are special .
are they ?
i think so .
what is this special power you hold over me , jones ?
and what about your therapy ?
i think you might be it .
# i' m not in love
# so don' t forget it
# it' s just a silly phase # i' m going through
# and just because
# i call you up
# don' t get me wrong
# don' t think you' ve got it made
# i' m not in love ...
god , i hope you' re wearing those giant panties .
please .
please be wearing the giant panties .
please .
oh , my old friends .
oh , daddy' s home .
did you miss me ?
because daddy missed you .
yes , he did .
wait .
sorry .
can i just have a minute ?
just a minute .
oh , god .
oh , god .
oh , god .
oh , god .
# big boys don' t cry big boys don' t cry
# big boys don' t cry big boys don' t cry ...
everything all right ?
yeah , sure .
just a bit ... nervous .
i mean , you see , if i stay with you tonight , well , it' s definitely the end of something ... important with someone .
um , which has probably ended already , but perhaps ...
bridge , bridge bridge , bridge .
doesn' t everyone deserve a second chance ?
hmm ?
except hitler .
well , he was very , very , very naughty .
what ?
nothing .
er , come back later , please .
thank you very much .
bridge , it' s nothing .
leave it .
leave it .
you made order for 10 . 30 .
order for what ?
me .
10 . 30 .
you know , i' ve had it up to here with this hotel .
it' s been cock ups like this all week .
you mr oleaver ?
yesterday , you with maria .
she say you big tipper .
i mean , i' m up for it if you are .
actually , no , that was stupid .
it' s just one little slip .
don' t let it ruin what was gonna be a fantastic weekend shagathon .
i don' t want a shagathon .
no , nor do i. nor do i.
you' re right .
you' re looking for a weekend of sex ,
i' m looking ...
for more .
i feel i can change .
i absolutely can change .
i need to change .
i can' t believe i fell for it again .
daniel , i really do think that you should go and fuck yourself .
or her .
but definitely not me . # think # think
# think about what you' re trying to do to me
# think # think think
# let your mind go ...
i can' t believe he made up the sex therapy thing .
doesn' t matter .
i finally learnt my lesson , and it' s an excellent lesson to have nailed .
fuck !
what ?
no fucking room in the fucking suitcase .
there' s room in mine .
give me something .
great .
what the hell is this ?
it is a fertility snake bowl .
ooh .
jed gave it to me . # think think # let your mind go ...
how romantic .
# freedom ...
the way i look at it , in everyone' s life , there' s a certain amount of shit .
that' s true .
in the last year , things have turned out pretty shitty .
so logically , mathematically , even , it' s got to be time for something not shit .
like what ?
maybe mark will have chucked rebecca .
and he' il run to my door , fall to his knees , possibly wearing a wet white shirt , and beg me to come back . # think # think
# think about what you' re tryin ' to do to me ...
yes , i very confidently expect very , very good times ahead .
final call for all passengers to london ...
isn' t he cute ?
hello .
hello .
oh ...
seems to be getting a bit excited .
oh .
er ...
bridget !
it' s just a misunderstanding .
hold the plane .
hold the plane .
excuse me !
excuse me !
all remaining passengers please report to gate 27 immediately .
it' s not mine .
these yours ?
yes .
i mean , they' re not my favourite pair .
you can' t do this .
i' m english .
and an award winning journalist .
well , maybe not award winning , but i have been to lots of award ceremonies .
hello .
bridget jones .
lovely to meet all of you .
oh , my bloody god and fuck .
i hope they' ve told the british ambassador .
surely shazzer would have raised the alert .
maybe they got shazzer as well .
oh , god , 28 hours .
how much longer ?
jones .
bridget jones , you come now .
charlie parker knowles , assistant consul .
thank god you' re here .
um , shall we ...
i really had absolutely nothing to do with it .
jed planned the whole thing .
that' s why he snogged shazzer , who' s much older than him and slightly past her peak .
yes , he sounds the most frightful shit .
mmm .
the bore is everyone who gets caught has exactly the same story , so unless we find this , this jed fellow and get a full confession , you' re on a bit of a sticky wicket .
well , how sticky ?
something like 15 to 20 years .
15 years ?
or maybe ten if we' re lucky .
ten years !
in here ?
very black .
all my life i' ve had the feeling something terrible was about to happen .
now it has .
bijjit , right ?
bridget , actually .
my name phrao .
you' re my friend ?
steady on !
superbra !
you lend me .
one day , two cigarette .
oh .
well , i' il think about it .
actually , i was thinking of giving up , but that was before i was arrested and thrown into a thai prison for ten to 15 years .
circumstances change .
no , it really , really is " touched " .
like a vir gin , touched for the very first time " .
no , you wrong .
no .
# like a wersion
vir gin . # fucked for the very first time
touched . # like a wersion
ten years of this ?
i
stop !
enough .
enough .
if you' re going to do it , you really ought to do it properly .
after all , madonna is nothing if not a perfectionist .
five , six , seven , eight and one ...
# like a virgin
# touched for the very first time
# like a virgin
# when your heart beats
# next to mine ...
dear mum and dad ,
i' m missing you a lot .
please write as soon as you can .
i' m feeling pretty low .
bijjit jone .
in there .
you have five minutes .
just five .
mark ?
you all right ?
oh ...
fine .
hmm .
and ... scared shitless .
but , you know , perky .
i can' t believe you' ve come all this way .
i haven' t .
i was out here handling a foreign office case when i heard about your situation .
i haven' t done anything wrong .
i promise you , it' s all a big mistake .
yes , well , i' m sure it is .
i' ve got all the papers here and i' m sure we can sort it out .
i think about you all the time .
and i' m so sorry ,
i really , really am , for everything that happened between us .
yes , well ...
we don' t have much time and i need you to identify someone for me .
is this the man with whom you were seen taking hallucinogenic mushrooms before you spent the night with daniel oleaver ?
yes , that' s him , but i think you should know ...
the same man who gave you the snake containing the drugs ?
yes , that' s him , that' s jed .
but it was shazzer' s snake , not mine , and as far as daniel oleaver goes ...
your sex life doesn' t concern me at all .
has there been any ill treatment here ?
no , no .
well , i mean ... ... the toilet facilities are well below par , but ...
good , that makes things simpler .
listen , they' re prepared to drop all charges against you which is extremely lenient , given the circumstances .
you' re going to be out within a week .
and ...
goodbye .
mark ?
thank you .
you' re welcome .
i' m just the messenger .
the order came from above .
well , good luck .
glad i could be of help .
so , bijjit , what happen ?
well , um ...
bijjit !
how this can happen ?
this is terrible !
you are innocent !
they' re always cheating us .
no , no , no .
that' s all fine .
they' ve dropped the charges and they' re letting me go .
but that good news .
what is wrong ?
mark darcy definitely ... ... doesn' t love me anymore .
ohhh .
you see the trouble is it was me who chucked him .
he treat you bad ?
yeah , actually , he did .
my boyfriend treat me bad too .
me too .
mine as well .
me too .
then you know all about it .
you think you' ve found the right man , but then there' s so much wrong with him and he finds there' s so much wrong with you and it all just falls apart .
don' t tell me .
my boyfriend , he seem really nice .
then he start to hit me .
make me work on street .
my boyfriend , he say he love me .
but he do no work , and make me work 24 hour a day .
then he make me take heroin drug .
what about you , bijjit ?
what your bad boyfriend do ?
well , er ... ... he really didn' t stick up for me at this lawyers ' supper ... and , um , then he would fold his ...
oh , same sort of thing , really .
hitting me and making me take drugs .
stealing all my money and stuff .
oh , god .
i' ve been the world s biggest fool .
bijjit ?
just a few tiny leaving presents .
no luxuries .

if you want something smooth on your wall , you could do worse than john currin .
he is about the only contemporary painter who can paint .
there' s usually something interesting and allegorical , plus of course , there is a very high perv quotient .
did you see her ?
out .
out it .
sorry , everyone , sorry .
it' s my stalker .
fuck off , darcy , some people have jobs to do .
did you see her surrounded by police , dogs , handcuffs ?
come on , she' s a big girl , she can take care of herself .
i' m only going to ask you one more time .
did you see her ?
you' re only gonna ask me one more time ?
you haven' t got your wig on now , dear .
i' il take that as a yes .
yes , i did see her .
right .
right , good .
will you step outside , please ?
oh , no , it' s not possible .
darcy , do you have any idea what century we actually live in ?
are you gonna step outside or am i gonna have to drag you ?
i think you' re gonna have to drag me .
you' re insane !
and you' re a disgrace , oleaver .
you' re pulling my hair !
i' m not going in the sodding water .
# touching you ' cause you' re touching me
# i believe in a thing called love
# just listen to the rhythm of my heart
# there' s a chance we can make it now
# we' il be rocking ' till the sun goes down
# i believe in a thing called love
# oooh ooh ooh ...
fuck off !
no , you' re going in , oleaver !
if i' m going in , you' re coming with me .
you smug bastard .
oh , my god .
get up .
well , what are you gonna do now ?
drown me in 16 inches of water ?
yes , good idea .
fuck !
stop , stop .
listen , listen , listen ...
ok , i left her at the airport .
i shouldn' t have done that .
but she bumped into jed herself and i didn' t fucking well seduce her , all right ?
you didn' t ?
there' s something wrong with her .
she' s gone all frigid .
i spent the night with a gorgeous thai girl .
who in fact turned out to be a gorgeous thai boy .
satisfied ?
yes .
thank you .
you know what , mate ?
if you' re so obsessed with bridget jones , why don' t you just marry her ?
' cause then she' d definitely shag me .
# i believe in a thing called love
# just listen to the rhythm of my heart
# i believe in a thing called love #
bridget !
bridget !
over here !
what was it like ?
how did you survive ?
any girl who' s been single in london knows how to handle herself .
darling !
will you be going back ?
sorry i didn' t write .
i' ve just been so busy .
hello , darling .
you look lovely .
skinny , but lovely .
oh , thank you .
oh , it' s good to be home .
ciggy ?
no , no , thanks .
i' ve given up again .
shame .
i find them very useful .
i take great comfort in the fact they might kill me before things get worse .
the darcys rang to say how pleased they were you were out .
i rather thought mark might be here to meet you .
yes , but you must remember we split up .
so no hope there ?
no hope there .
believe me , next time i will not fuck it up , mum .
language , darling .
sorry .
next time , i will not fuck it up ... ... mother .

hello .
hello .
oh , darling .
hiya .
bridget ...
i' m so sorry .
it' s all right .
well , thank god for mark darcy .
i mean , he might be a boring arse , but he performed a miracle .
that' s a bit of an overstatement .
he actually seems to be the villain of this piece .
he' s a top human rights lawyer and he left it to someone else to get me out .
he was just a messenger .
who told you that ?
he did .
straight from the horse' s mouth .
the horse wasn' t quite telling you the truth .
i called mark the minute i landed in london .
we went to his office and within half an hour , he' d woken two cabinet ministers and half of ml5 .
but none of them could locate jed , so mark flew over to interpol .
which is in lyon .
they located jed in dubai , but they don' t normally extradite people , so mark rang the home secretary who rang our ambassador ...
in riyadh .
then mark flew to dubai where he identified jed , who was impounded and pushed out into ...
saudi arabia , where mark was waiting with the police .
jed was arrested and extradited back to britain .
then mark flew to bangkok , to make damn sure they' d let you go .
oh .
he was just angry about daniel oleaver .
he must still love me .
he fucking must .
taxi ?
yes , please .
get in the cab !
hurry !
oh .
i forgot about you .
er , i , i , i just wanted to , um ... say something to mark .
he' s at the office .
do you want to come in ?
oh , no .
no , no , i don' t think i will .
i really hope that you' il be happy together .
sorry ?
you and mark .
i really hope that you' il be very happy together .
no , no , no , bridget , listen ... you' ve got it completely wrong .
i' m not in love with him .
how could i be when i' m ... seriously heartbroken and smitten with someone else ?
someone else ?
you , bridget .
me ?
ever since i saw you here with your hair messed that night and bits of garden stuck to you .
you must have noticed .
i try to hide it , but every time i see you , i light up .
i thought you were just , you know ... ... lying .
was every look i ever gave you a lie ?
i' ve been looking forward to this .
lovely to see you , bridget .
thank you very much .
that was lovely .
really lovely .
but i' m afraid it' s still men in general , and mark darcy in particular , that i love .
right .
lf , er , if i ever do decide to , um ... you know , bat for the other side ... ... well , there' s no one else .
only you .
hello , giles .
hello , bridget .
# open up your eyes
# then you' il realise
# here i stand with my
# everlasting love
# need you by my side
# girl , to be my bride
# you' il never be denied ...
inns of court , please .
fast as you can .
what do you think of this jacket ?
yeah , very nice indeed .
no , be honest .
what do you think of the whole jacket/ trouser combination ?
disaster .
actually , can we take a tiny detour ?
i' il be back in literally two seconds .
# where life really flows
# no one really knows
# till someone' s there to show
# the way to lasting love
# need a love to last forever
# need a love to last forever ...
oh .
# you' re the first
# the last
# my everything
# and the answer to
# all my dreams
# you' re my sun
# my moon
# my guiding star
# my kind of wonderful
# that' s what you are ...
you look gorgeous .
thank you .
very important at this moment .
# there' s no way
# they could have made two ...
doesn' t matter .
it' s not about looks .
# your love i' il keep for evermore as i was saying .
# you' re the first ...
excuse me , i' m looking for mr darcy .
down there , right along the corridor , and just to the left .
thank you very much .
# oh oh , oh oh , oh oh , oh no no
# oh oh , oh oh , oh oh , oh no no
# oh oh , oh oh , oh oh , oh no no
# oh oh , oh oh , oh oh , oh no no ...
i love you .
i always have and i always will .
oh , um ...
i don' t love you , and i never have , and ... ... i never will .
sorry .
come in .
hello , bridget .
hello , mark .
er ...
i' m sorry , i' m disturbing you .
well , yes , a bit .
i' il just ... sit outside while you finish .
no , no , no , please , say what you have to say , young lady .
mr santiago is the peruvian secretary for trade .
and mr hernndez is his number two .
hello .
hello .
hello , hello , hello .
how can we help you , young lady ?
well , er ...
er ...
i just wanted to tell mr darcy here that i heard what magnificent work he actually did releasing me from prison .
tiny , tiny misunderstanding to do with an enormous stash of cocaine .
and i also wanted to say , since having found out that his girlfriend is actually a lesbian ...
... that i love him .
always have .
always will .
and that i' m ... ... you know ... ... available for dates ... ... if he should feel so inclined .
so , er , your girlfriend is a lesbian .
look , if you' il all just excuse us for a second ...
i think we should ...
bridget , that was not the most romantic proposition i' ve ever heard .
well , maybe it is romantic because it' s not .
i mean ...
i know there' s no music playing , and it' s not snowing , but that doesn' t mean that it , that it can' t really be something .
you' re right .
in fact , there' s a question i' ve been meaning to ask you .
all right .
as long as it' s not " will you marry me ?
