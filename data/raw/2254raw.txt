tessa , you have to understand the scale of this .

just ... a few questions .
okay , let' s talk here .
with these people .
all right .
okay .
my bike' s across the street .
ask your questions before we get to it .
is it a scam ?
scam ?
dypraxa .
does it cure t. b ?
yes , it cures .
but it can also kill , you know , because they haven' t got the formula right .
right .
so why don' t they work on that ?
it' s cheaper to fix the trials .
exclude the patients that have side effects , you know .
to go back to the lab would cost them time ... two years ... millions of dollars , and other companies would have time to produce their own cures .
okay , next question .
you said to tessa in your e mails that the kenyan government had approved the trials .
somebody bribed them .
who ?
threebees , lorbeer .
we don' t know .
but $50, 000 in the right hands , and you can test battery acid as skin lotion .
my bike' s there .
stop !
stop !
stop !
<i>[ chattering in german ] </ i>

kdh is swiss canadian .

christ , justin , stop bleeding for bloody africa and show some loyalty .
that plant kdh built in wales could have gone to france .
fifteen hundred jobs in a depressed region .
we owed them .
they needed help with the dypraxa trials .
kdh needed an investment partner here .
<i>curtiss and threebees</ i> <i>served us both . </ i>

it was a bizarre sort of suicide .
his body bore no fewer than eight bullet wounds ... from three different guns , none of which was the one found in his hand .
so who has got away with murder ?
not , of course , the british government .
<i>they merely covered up, </ i> <i>as one does , the offensive corpses . </ i>
