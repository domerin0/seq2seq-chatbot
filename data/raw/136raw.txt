you are tired enough for caring me and you should take some rich food
amida buddha
as a buddhist it' s guilty even to think of it
it' s hard to enjoy such good food
no one will come here , you may eat
master ...
master ...
master during these years in shao lin temple we work more than we eat
it' s tired it' s hard to have this rich food

these buddhists came here when they were in danger
in such case , so they aren' t so devoted
let' s eat , it taste good ...

with buddha in your heart wine and meat are nothing
we must have buddha in heart and help people

look at this girl !
is she really your daughter ?
this girl had no mother since she was a baby
at that time i was being attacked by wang jen tse and was force to hide myself in shao lin temple
so i made her stay at a farmer' s home
the old man spoiled her because he had no kids
i must kill wang jen tse for revenge
please teach me shao lin kung fu
the temple has rule kung fu is use for protection it cannot be learnt by other people
you aren' t shao lin monks , i ...
i' m willing to become a monk
no killing
it bite me
the temple' s door is widely opened for good man to enter
he seems enjoying to kill
the temple cannot allow him
buddhist should be merciful

shao lin kung fu is for defense and not attack
you look like enjoying to kill
you' re punished to face the wall for three days !
oh brother !
brother
aren' t you afraid of being punished again ?
i ...
go back to your work !
should we regard killing mosquito as a sin ?
if that is so how can i revenge my father' s death ?
why should i be a monk without learning kung fu ?
it is not that easy to be a monk
i don' t want to be a monk any more
