cambodia .
to many westerners , it seemed a paradise .
another world , a secret world .
but the war in neighboring vietnam burst its borders ... ... and the fighting soon spread to neutral cambodia .
in 1973 , i went to cover this sideshow struggle ... ... as foreign correspondent of the new york times .
it was there , amidst the fighting ... ... between government troops and the khmer rouge guerrillas ... ... that i met my guide and interpreter , dith pran ... ... a man who was to change my life ... ... in a country that i grew to love and pity .
so here we go with voice of america ... ... news for southeast asia .
it' s 6 : 45 and a partly cloudy morning here .
clouds too in washington .
president nixon announced he' il address the nation on watergate ... ... within the next few days .
the speech will be nixon' s first since may .
the scandal has caused resignations and paralyzed the white house staff .
it has also led to intense confrontation and perhaps ... ... a constitutional crisis with senate investigators ... ... and a special watergate prosecutor .
the speech was announced after the gallup poll disclosed ... ... that mr. nixon' s popularity had fallen to the lowest point ... ... for an american president in 20 years .
a supreme court judge , william o. douglas ... ... has ruled against an appeal by the administration ... ... for a stay of the injunction ... ... on further u. s. bombing missions in cambodia .
congress has already ruled these bombings illegal ... ... and they should cease in one week' s time on august the 15th .
let' s go , sarun !
to the hospital !

k. r. ' s making a push for the airport road .
if they cut it , the city could be lost .
we hype these people up .
you' il be all right with us , " we say .
now look at all this fucking mess !
in america , everybody got a good car .
he ask you what car you drive in united states .
i don' t have a car in america , only the mercedes here .
mercedes , number one !
ask him where he learned to speak his english .
american advisor with his unit teach him .

made in the usa .
are we winning ?
no , you' re not winning .
what should we do ?
well , you make sure they don' t cut off the airport road .
the first section came by route number 36 .
and the second one came down by route number 26 .
khmer rouge will come down route 3 .
he doesn' t know how many .
they expect an attack today .
where' s your commander ?
phnom penh .

they pulling out ?
i' m not happy here , syd .
jon , i' m leaving .
syd , come on !
come on !
sydney , this way !
sydney , look !
khmer rouge !
let' s face it , you took advantage of us .
i can' t eat .
you are cleverer than we are , and you induced us into this fighting .
indeed , the khmer rouge insurgents in cambodia ... ... have tightened their ring around the capital , phnom penh ... ... now swollen with some two million refugees from the fighting .
reports from government troops talk of the field situation being so bad ... ... that soldiers are having to siphon gas from jeep to jeep ... ... in order to be able to get the wounded back to the capital .
no more electricity .
and now i get a message to try for negotiations .
well , it' s just too goddamn late !
alan , this country' s split apart .
we put this ship to sea , and it breaks my heart not to help it back to port .
any port .
what pisses me off is , this country has faults and strengths ... ... and we have done nothing but play to the faults .
i tell you , i will be damn glad to get out of here .
this thing has dragged on too long for it to end in all sweetness and light .
after what the khmer rouge have been through ... ... they won' t be exactly affectionate toward westerners .
where do you want this ?
on the floor .
anywhere .
mr. schanberg ...
oh , christ , my dependents !
six .
dith pran and family .
right .
dear sir , my family and i are planning a touring vacation of southeast asia ... ... and anticipate two weeks in cambodia touring the country .
would you please send tour information and brochures ?
thanking you in advance , wendell payne .
wendell lives in wisacky , south carolina .
what about the airlift ?
we' re taking it with us .
people will starve to death .
i know , but what can we do ?
look , there could be a bloodbath here .
excuse the pun , but we' re either staying or we' re living .
hello , leaving a sinking ship then , are we , carver ?
president ford , in his foreign policy speech , hardly referred to cambodia ... ... except to say that , as of now , it may be too late .
i' m sorry .
i' m late .
where you been ?
they stop me because of the curfew .
the curfew , huh ?
yes .
i' m sorry .

so now it' s up to you .
what do you want to do ?
do you want to stay or leave ?
and how about you ?

do you want to stay , or do you want to leave ?
i know .
you love my family .
but me , i' m reporter too .

this is blood group a. we' ve had one unit of blood in the last two days .
plasma substitute , please , quick .
we' ve plenty of blood , gentlemen .
plenty of blood .
the problem is , it' s all in the wrong fucking place .
why do corpses have to pile up before people decide it' s time to go home ?
for god' s sake , back up the car !
sarun , back it up !
for god' s sake , back it up now !
why doesn' t he get his ass in here ?
he' s trying to get in !
they won' t let him in .

i' m coming !
just a minute !
he' s with me !
he' s with the new york times !
wait just a minute !
he' s a journalist and he' s with me !
where is the consul ?
i want to talk to the consul .
let me see him !
you tell me where he is .
i want to speak to him !
the picture in cambodia is increasingly unclear .
journalists who have flown from thailand over phnom penh ... ... report that the khmer rouge have attempted ... ... a mass evacuation of the entire population .
radio contact with the french embassy reveals that some 200 europeans ... ... and an undisclosed number of cambodians have taken refuge .
as yet , no statement has been made by the new rulers of cambodia .
the whereabouts of prince sihanouk and the khmer rouge leadership ... ... are not clear .
okay ?
yes .
he' s sleeping .
that' s the consul .
did you see that , dennis ?
the russians are coming .
look , piss off !
please !
get out !
you won' t get anything here !
out !
first , the main points of the news .
bbc , dougal .
daily reports of fighting around the airport ... ... 14 kilometers outside phnom penh , the capital of cambodia .
and now , an on the spot report from our correspondent in thailand ... ... hugh elder .
where do they get this crap ?
do you see that guy across the gate ?
the little guy ?
could we not all look at once , please ?
i have it on reliable sources that that' s hugh elder .
you' re kidding .
he' s disguised , but i got suspicious about him .
you know what i mean ?
how does he get copy out ?
how does he get his copy out ?
with specially trained hens .
the bbc has , like , commissioned them to walk past the khmer rouge ... ... like their regular fowl .
they' ve been crossing the border into thailand every day and every night .
i told you .
unconfirmed reports say the khmer rouge are demanding ... ... that any officials of the defeated lon nol government ... ... especially the so called six traitors of the cabinet ... ... be handed over to them .
it is not known whether any of the ex ministers ... ... may have taken refuge in the embassy ... ... where , in the words of a unlcef representative in bangkok ... ... the situation is said to be " increasingly precarious .
and when i tried to go just a kilometer further , no .
the only sense i can make of it is that there' s ... ... some sort of internal power struggle going on .
different groups seem to be holding different parts of the city ... ... and they all appear to be equally nervous over losing power and control .
half of them are under 15 .
some red cross instruction sheets want translating .
can you help ?
use pran .
he speaks french better than i do .
i' d prefer it if it was you .
