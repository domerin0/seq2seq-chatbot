there are many stories about michael sullivan .
some say he was a decent man .
some say there was no good in him at all .
but i once spent six weeks on the road with him ... ... in the winter of 1931 .
this is our story .
thank you , sir .

sir ?
it' s a wake , so i don' t want to see those dice .
no , sir .
hello .
i don' t wanna go .
come on , it' s all right .
no .
i' m scared .
ice helps preserve the body .
so ... ... who' s got a hug for a lonely old man ?
now then , which is which ?
don' t help me .
peter and michael .
no !
annie , mike , good to see you .
did you bring the necessary ?
yes .
if you' il excuse me , i have urgent business with these young gentlemen .
yeah !
winner !
call the cops !
i know hustlers when i see them .
i don' t hustle , old timer .
pay the man .
upstairs .
jacket pocket , in my study .
before i change my mind .
hello ?
hello .
remind me , which little sullivan are you ?
michael , sir .
sir ?
you don' t have to call me sir .
i' m not your pa .
no , mr. rooney .
call me connor .
no , call me uncle connor .
what do you want ?
mr. rooney sent me to get his jacket .
you come back later , huh ?
i' m busy .
yes ....
sir .
hello , hello .
i want to welcome all of you to my home .
it' s good to have so many friends in this house again .
since mary died , it' s ....
well , it' s just been me and my boy rattling around in these rooms .
i had this speech prepared , but it would be ... ... dishonest of me to say that i knew danny well .
but lose one of us , it hurts us all .
i' il tell you what i do remember , though , and finn will remember this too ... ... and that' s danny on the high school football team .
a championship game .
down six points , 10 seconds left to play ... ... four yards to go , danny tackles his own quarterback .
mistakes , you know ....
we all make them .
god knows .
let' s drink to danny' s honor .
let' s swig him to god and hope that he gets to heaven ... ... at least an hour before the devil finds out he' s dead .
amen .
to danny !
and now , i would like to ask a dear and a trusted friend ... ... finn mcgovern , to say a few words ... ... words that i' il wager got more poetry than mine .
get over here .
thank you , john .
my brother danny wasn' t wise .
nor was he gentle .
and with a skinful of liquor in him , he was a pain in the ass .
but he was loyal and brave .
and he never told a lie .
he' d have enjoyed this party .
me and the family , we wanna say thank you to our generous host .
where would this town be without mr. john rooney ?
i' ve worked for you for many years now , john .
nearly half my life .
and we' ve never had a disagreement .
i' ve come to realize that you rule this town ... ... as god rules the earth .
you give , and you take away  lovely .
lovely speech .
i' m gonna bury my brother .
then i' m gonna deal with you .
sure , finn , sure .
you' il take care of all of us .
once you get a good night' s sleep .
he all right ?
yeah , he' s fine .
just too much to drink .
i' il talk to him .
take mike with you .
no , pa
take mike with you .
just talk , nothing more .
why are you always smiling ?
' cause it' s all so fucking hysterical .
michael .
what ?
i had a nightmare .
it was about mr. rooney' s house .
it' s just a house .
a big house .
go back to sleep .
is mr. rooney rich like the babe ?
richer .
are we rich ?
no , stupid .
what' s papa' s job ?
he works for mr. rooney .
why ?
well , papa didn' t have a father ... ... so mr. rooney looked after him .
i know that , but what' s his job ?
he goes on missions for mr. rooney .
they' re very dangerous .
that' s why he brings his gun .
sometimes even the president sends him on missions ... ... ' cause papa was a war hero and all .
you' re just making that up .
i am not .
it' s all so fucking hysterical .
peter , i can' t come to your concert tonight .
i' m working .
working at what ?
putting food on your plate , young man .
all right , boys , come on , clear the plates .
you' re a good lad .
you want a shot ?
no .
we' re just talking to him , right ?
sure .
don' t get me wrong , finn .
i feel for you .
i do .
you can' t let a thing like that give you cause to go mouthing off .
you and my dad , you go back many years ... ... and he is a just man .
so , what do you say ?
come on now , finn .
make this easy .
we can' t hear you .
all right .
good .
thank you .
i am sorry .
i' m sorry for your loss .
i' m sorry for this misunderstanding .
and i' m sorry your brother was such a fucking liar .
my brother was not a liar .
excuse me ?
to protect my family and keep my job , i' il stay quiet .
but don' t think i don' t know something' s going on .
don' t think i won' t find out what it is .
whoa , buddy
easy , easy .
easy .
we' re just talking .
you tell your father my brother never stole from him .
i' ve checked the books .
he never sold booze to no one .
it' s all accounted for .
lf he sold it , where' s the money ?
fuck should i know ?
did you check his mattress ?
maybe you should check yours .
there' s something immoral here , don' t you think , mike ?
my beloved father throws your undeserving little brother ... ... the wake of his life , and this this is your thank you ?
what a hideous world this is .
you think you' re so smart .
you think we don' t know ?
you' re spending so much time in chicago
what was that ?
we' re out of here .
jesus christ , connor , what the hell are you thinking ? !
jesus .
michael .
are you hurt ?
you saw everything ?
jesus .
you are not to speak of this to anyone .
you understand ?
not to anyone !
who' s this ?
it' s one of yours ?
he must have been hiding in the car .
well , can he keep a secret ?
he' s my son .
well , that' s good enough for me .
you take him home .
think i' il walk .
perfect night for a stroll .
does mama know ?
your mother knows i love mr. rooney .
when we had nothing ... ... he gave us a home , a life .
we owe him .
do you understand ?
do you understand ?
yes .
well , come on inside , then .
boys , clear your plates , please .
i' il do it later .
it' s time for school now  it' s only a plate !
what' s he doing here ?
michael was hiding in the car ... ... when i went out last night .
jesus , mike .
i' ve spoken to him .
it won' t happen again .
mom .
mom !
just the feller ....
our secret , right ?
i' m talking about the dice .
a man of honor always pays his debts .
and keeps his word .
i' m gonna be late for school .
how is michael ?
is he okay ?
i' ve spoken to him .
he understands .
that' s tough ... ... seeing that for the first time .
well , you turned out .
you can' t protect them forever .
if it wasn' t this , it' d be something else .
natural law .
sons are put on this earth to trouble their fathers .
john' s also made it clear that finn mcgovern' s operation ... ... will be divided up locally ... ... among two territories that john will select personally .
i' d like to take this moment to thank mr. rance for ... ... interrupting a busy travel schedule to pay us a visit .
thank you , jack .
mr. rance met with john and me earlier to make another bid ... ... for our involvement in the unions .
what men do after work is what made us rich .
no need to screw them at work as well .
ls there any other business ?
yes .
connor , is there something you would like to say about last night ?
i' d like to apologize for what happened .
especially to you , pa .
two wakes in a month ....
what can i say ?
we lost a good man last night .
you think it' s funny ?
try again .
i' d like to apologize
you would like to apologize ?
try again .
gentlemen ... ... my apologies .
is everyone clear about bit borrowers ?
there have been far too many debts outstanding .
mike ....
just give me their names .
tell me who to visit .
thank you , gentlemen .
come on upstairs .
mike .
dad forgot to give you this .
it' s just a reminder for tony calvino .
he' s light again .
are you coming ?
no , i' m under house arrest for a while .
look , i' m sorry about last night .
i am .
i was ....
yeah .
all right .
help you , sir ?
or just looking ?
here to see tony calvino .
yeah , and who are you ?
mike sullivan .
yes , sir .
you gonna frisk me ?
should i ?
it' s a good idea .
that' s the only one .
i mean , i' m a grown man and this place is getting to me .
every night there' s trouble .
no one' s got no dough , but all the world' s here wasting it .
always money for frills and twists , and never money for food .
sometimes i despair the species , you know ?
number 12 in the beauty parlor .
who' s the lucky face ?
i' m not from here originally , but jobs ain' t hanging off trees , you know .
i' m a boxer by trade .
nine consecutive titles .
that' s a record in south orange .
i' d make a pretty good bodyguard , i think .
what i' m saying is , is mr. rooney looking for anyone ?
you know , anyone like me , for example ?
is there any chance you might ask him ?
sure .
thank you , mr. sullivan .
thank you very much .
i appreciate it .
mr. calvino ?
mr. calvino , mike sullivan' s here .
shit .
he wants to see you .
shit .
is he packing ?
not anymore .
all right .
show him in .
hey , hey , hey .
you stick around , okay ?
hey !
how the hell are you ?
things good with the old man ?
yeah .
what brings you here ?
don' t imagine it' s the pussy .
i have a letter for you from mr. rooney .
am i behind again ?
am i in trouble ?
i don' t know .
michael .
no !
no !
my god !
pa , i' m sorry .
stupid !
the kid would' ve talked .
i' m sorry .
goddamn you .
goddamn you !
i curse the fucking day you were born !
i curse it !
you !
oh , lord .
oh , lord .
god help us .
god help us .
this house is not our home anymore .
it' s just an empty building .
all right , you stay here .
you stay out of sight .
don' t go , pa .
don' t go .
michael ... ... when they find out we' re gone , they' re gonna come after us .
i have to protect you now .
please , pa .
all right , here , take this .
no .
i don' t want it .
take it .
i don' t want it .
boy , take it !
you got six shots .
if i' m not back in half an hour , go tell reverend lynch what' s happened .
do not go to father callaway .
i don' t have any business with you , mr. kelly .
but i have business with you , mike .
go ahead .
what is that ?
25, 000 dollars .
mr. rooney wants you to know there' s more if you need it .
you have friends in ireland , mike .
why don' t you take peter and leave ?
i can' t take peter .
he' s dead .
so where' s connor ?
he' s in hiding .
where ?
you know i can' t tell you that .
you think sticking a gun to my head is gonna make any difference to me ?
if i tell you , i' m a dead man anyway .
we both are .
think , mike .
don' t be stupid .
i' m just the messenger .
then give mr. rooney a message for me .
what is it ?
give me the gun .
where are we going ?
to chicago .
there' s a man there who runs things .
i' ve done some work for him .
we have to find out where he stands .
try to get some sleep .
i want you to wait for me here .
sure .
i won' t be long .
you' il be all right ?
yeah , i' il be all right .
that' s a good boy .
hello , mike .
hello , fellas .
it' s nice to see you .
we heard what happened .
how you holding up ?
i need to talk to mr. nitti .
he' s awful busy .
i can wait .
okay .
take the man to the top .
certainly , sir .
sorry to make you wait so long , mike .
come on in .
we all just heard what happened .
jesus , i' m sorry , mike .
well , thank you for seeing me , mr. nitti .
come on , sit down .
like some coffee or ... ?
no .
you sure ?
yes , thank you .
so , what can i do for you , mike ?
i' d like to work for you .
well , that' s very interesting .
and in return , i' d like you to turn a blind eye to what i have to do .
and what is that ?
kill the man who murdered my family .
is one more body gonna make a difference ?
this is a good proposal , mr. nitti .
i will work only for you , and you know i can do a good job .
i respect you , mike .
i do .
we would like nothing more than to have you come work for us .
but not like this .
what you' re asking me is impossible .
is it ?
let me explain something to you that maybe you haven' t realized .
all these years , you' ve been living under the protection ... ... of people who care about you .
and those same people are protecting you now , including me .
so if you go ahead with this , if you open that door ... ... you' re walking through it alone .
and all that loyalty , all that trust , will no longer exist for you .
and mike , you won' t make it .
not on your own .
and not with a little boy .
you' re protecting him already ?
we' re protecting our interests , mike .
i drove all through the night to see you .
i appreciate that .
now i suggest you drive yourself back .
go home , mike .
go home and bury your wife and child .
with our blessing .
it won' t be that simple .
you heard ?
dad , listen to me .
he' s in the building .
you can end this now .
take him now .
connor , get upstairs .
god help me .
god help me .
what do i do ?
you think objectively .
and you make your choice .
what would you do if sullivan were just some guy ?
god help me .
make it quick .
and the kid ?
oh , christ .
no , no .
one day the kid becomes a man ....
think he won' t remember ?
i said not the kid .
all right .
i know who to call .
there' s a guy who' s done some work for us in the past .
he' s gifted .
excuse me , ma' am .
press .
press .
he was raping my wife .
he raped my wife .
come on , come on , you' re treading on the evidence here .
two minutes .
you got it , mr. maguire .
harlen maguire .
good evening , mr. nitti .
sixteen hundred .
sixteen hundred dollars is my rate , mr. nitti .
and what i make on the photographs is mine .
no , never met him .
but i know his work .

how old ?
what do i do with the kid ?

thank you .

your mom' s sister ?
she lives in perdition .
she' il take you in .

we went there once , all of us , when you were 4 , maybe 5 .
it' s beautiful .
you remember ?
the place with the dog .
hello ?

mike .
oh , thank god .
i want you to know we' re okay .

how was it ?
oh , mike ....
hello ?
we' il see you soon .
hello , operator ?
yes , sir .

might not be another diner for a while , so you should eat .
i' m not hungry .
i just wanna read .
slow night , huh ?
you kidding ?
this is busy .
what can i get you ?

everything' s special .
ls that so ?
everything except the food .
everything except the food ?
you ought to be on the stage .
don' t i know it .
give me some of that honey dipped fried chicken and a black coffee .
duck soup .
don' t mind me , sir .
it' s a free country .
used to be , anyhow .
no , thank you , sir .
is that your profession or your pleasure ?
both , i guess .
to be paid to do what you love ....
ain' t that the dream ?
i guess so .
yourself ?
i' m a salesman .
machine parts .
machine parts .
that' s wonderful .
i assure you , it is not .
so who do you work for ?
can you keep a secret ?

i' m something of a rarity .
how' s that ?

dead bodies , that is .
i don' t kill them .
i should hope not .
always fascinated me , the look of them , you know ?

yeah .
sorry for you .

but it sure makes you feel alive , don' t it ?

none of this is your fault .
just take me to aunt sarah' s .
i can' t take you there .
just take me to aunt sarah' s .
i can' t take you there .
not now .
why ?
he knows that' s where we' re going .
so , what are you gonna do ?
something i can' t do alone .
you have to listen to me now , okay ?
or else both of us are dead .
i have to make capone give up connor .
there' s one thing chicago loves more than anything ... ... and that' s their money .
they' ve got it in banks all over the state .
we have to find it and take it .
are you gonna help me ?
yes .
then i have to teach you something .
you know what the clutch is ?
sure i know what the clutch is .
what is the clutch ?
the clutch , it ....

right , it clutches .
which of those pedals is the clutch ?
that' s the gas .

oh , yeah , yeah , we made it .
no more excuses .
i' ve told you once , now i' m telling you again
i' m looking for a mr. mcdougal .
just one moment .
well , this is a pleasant surprise .
i wasn' t expecting another deposit until the end of the month .
actually , i' m making a withdrawal .
i want dirty money only .
everything you' re holding for capone that' s off the books .
open the safe .
you' re insane .
you know they' il find out who you are .
the name' s sullivan .
you want me to spell it ?
open the box .
they' il kill you .
they' re animals .
you don' t say .
put it in .
that' s for you .
call it a handling charge .
tell chicago i took it .
but if i read about this in the papers , if i read about the savings of farmers ... ... being wiped out by a heartless bank robber , i won' t be happy .
good afternoon .
you really trust me not to say anything ?
always trust a bank manager .
there' s no rush .
coffee ?
thank you .
so , what brings you guys to the middle of nowhere ?
we' re bank robbers .
we' re just passing through .
so when do i get my share of the money ?
well , how much do you want ?
two hundred dollars .
okay .
deal .
could i have had more ?
you' il never know .
come on , come on .
how much did they take ?
how much ?
what are we paying you for ?
where' s my father ?
what' s this ?
why is no one talking to me ?
i feel like a fucking prisoner .
i told you .
you are not a prisoner .
you are being protected .
this is what your father wants .
i can look after myself .
no , you can' t .
this is the point .
you' re a big baby who doesn' t know his thumb from his dick .
fuck you .
the only reason you' re still alive is because you' re john rooney' s son .
you' re being a little shortsighted here , frank .
my father is an old man .
i am the future .
so don' t you ever talk to me that way again .
maguire , do what you have to .
find them .
i' m sorry , mr. sullivan , there is no money .
no i can get you money , i just
it won' t be chicago' s .
they took it all out two days ago .
who authorized it ?
the accountant .
what' s his name ?
this is mr. rance in the bridal suite .
before you proffer your congratulations , there' s no mrs. rance with me ... ... and i' m all the better for it .
listen carefully ... ... because i am in no mood .
i' m going to say this only once .
i would like a boiled egg , and i want it runny .
pa , can we sleep in a motel room tonight instead of the car ?
yeah , that would be nice .
how many more days you gonna want me , mister ?
can' t we close the curtains , even for a little while ?
i can' t get no sleep with all that light .
you see anything , you hit that horn twice .
don' t get out of the car , no matter what .
bye .
ready ?
i' m ready .
yes , sir .
right away , sir .
runny .
it' s open .
top marks for speed , no marks for cookery .
what , may i ask , do you call this ?
put it down .
mr. sullivan .
mr. rance .
how did you find me ?
this is the best hotel in the area .
and you are so very particular .
yes , indeed , mr. sullivan .
may i ask you to lower your weapon .
thank you .
now , what do you want ?
information .
i can' t give you the files .
all right , all right .
they' re in the next room .
ln here .
bring it in .
i can' t see .
what will you accomplish by interfering with our business ?
this has nothing to do with business .
it' s all business .
you fail to grasp that .
and in business , you must have something to trade .
and you , mr. sullivan , have nothing to trade .
especially not for anyone as valuable as connor rooney .
i don' t understand .
opening bell on wall street .
come on , open it .
which one is it ?
no , no , not it .
tried that one already .
better start over .
you got one more try .
there it is .
i' m okay .
watch the road !
pa !
pa , are you okay ?
pa !
pa !
help !
help us !
help !
help !
help us !
when are you two heading out ?
we' ve stayed long enough .
we don' t wanna cause you any trouble .
no trouble so far .
he' s a good worker .
you have any kids ?
no .
we met too late .
he dotes on you .
you don' t see it .
hello .
i had a bad dream .
you wanna talk about it ?
well , come on in .
take a seat ... ... if you want .
math , huh ?
yeah .
i always hated it .
me too .
so , what do you like ?
huh ?
what subjects do you like ?
did you like in school ?
bible history , maybe .
why ?
i like the stories .
peter was good at math .
was he ?
did you like peter more than me ?
no .
no , michael .
i loved you both the same .
but you were ....
you were different with me .
was i ?
well ....
maybe it was because peter was just such a sweet boy , you know ?
and you ....
you were more like me .
and i didn' t want you to be .
i didn' t mean to be ... ... different .
okay .
good night , pa .
good night .
michael , wake up .
get your things .
we' re leaving .
we left you something .
hello , john .
you' re a smart man , michael .
i wanna talk .
here ?
downstairs .
i didn' t think i' d see you again .
read this .
connor' s been stealing from you for years .
he keeps accounts open under the names of dead men .
men like the mcgoverns .
i stood there and helped him kill finn to line his own pockets .
i thought i was working for you , but i wasn' t .
you think i' d give up my son ?
he was betraying you .
i know .
now , listen to me .
i tried to avoid more bloodshed .
you wouldn' t accept that ... ... so i did what was necessary .
but i' ve always loved you like a son .
and now i' m telling you , leave before it' s too late .
think .
think .
they' re protecting him now , but when you' re gone , they won' t need him .
this ends with connor dead regardless .
that may be ... ... but you are asking me ... ... to give you the key to his room so you can walk in ... ... put a gun to his head and pull the trigger .
i can' t do that .
he murdered annie and peter .
there are only murderers in this room .
michael , open your eyes .
this is the life we chose , the life we lead .
none of us will see heaven .
michael could .
then do everything that you can to see that that happens .
leave .
i' m begging you .
it' s the only way .
and if i go ?
then ... ... i will mourn ... ... the son i lost .
what are you gonna do ?
just one last thing , and then it' s done .
go back to bed , michael .
i' m glad it' s you .
i understand .
but then al wants your assurance that after that , it' s over .
the lexington hotel , room 1432 .
is that the house ?
that' s it .
i knew there was a dog .
sarah ?
it' s me , mike .
we' re here .
smile .
give me the gun .
michael .
michael ... ... don' t you do this .
give me the gun , michael .
come on .
give me the gun .
i couldn' t do it .
i know .
pa .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
pa .
pa !
pa !
pa !
pa !
pa !
i saw then that my father' s only fear ... ... was that his son would follow the same road .
and that was the last time i ever held a gun .
people always thought i grew up on a farm .
and i guess , in a way , i did .
but i lived a lifetime before that ... ... in those six weeks on the road ... ... in the winter of 1931 .
when people ask me if michael sullivan was a good man ... ... or if there was just no good in him at all ... ... i always give the same answer .
he was my father .
