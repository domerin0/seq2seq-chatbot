more news in just a minute .
jiji , i' ve decided !
i' m gonna do it tonight !
mom !
oh , hi , miss dora .
it' s gonna be completely clear tonight .
mom , i heard the weather forecast .
there' s gonna be a full moon .
kiki , did you borrow your fathers radio again without permission ?
yes , im sorry .
happy to see you miss dora .
mom , my mind is made up .
its tonight !
weren' t you gonna put it off a month ?
but the next full moon might be a cloudy night .
i want to make sure i leave on the perfect night .
wait , kiki !
my , my , whats this leaving business ?
it' s one of our old customs .
when a witch turns 13 , she leaves home for a year to begin her training .
your little baby is already 13 ?
time flies so quickly , doesn' t it ?
i' m afraid so .
but nobody leaves home that young anymore .
i remember perfectly well ... the exact day you arrived here in this town .
a little 13 year old gitl came down from the sky ... riding a broomstick , her eyes shining .
i had thought that you were a bit stuck up .
but she knows not much besides flying .
she hardly knows any of my formulas .
after i' m gone , who will make this medicine ?
sign of time i' m afraid .
everything changes , bit by bit .
but i have to say , nothing works as well for my rheumatism .
you' re always telling me to hurry !
now who' s the slowpoke ?
i think its better to leave with decorum and great dignity .
if we put it off for a month ... and i find some wonderful boyfriend , then what ?
we' il never leave !
i' m worried about once you decided , you can' t go back .
sure , i know that .
good , it' s there .
i' m so exited !
its like getting a birthday present !
oh !
dad !
you know what ?
i' ve decided to go tonight !
tonight ?
yes , i just made up my mind !
well , yes , but what about our camping trip for this weekend ?
i' m sorry !
but , ahm ....
yes , i' il expect you then .
thanks .
hi , mom .
i wanted to make sure you knew that kiki is leaving tonight .
yes , midnight .
hey , looks great !
i wish it had a different color .
witches have worn that color for over a thousand years
black cat , black clothes
kiki , it' s not important what color your dress is .
what matters is the heart inside it .
i know that having a good heart is very important .
i wish i could show you that my heart is ready .
just follow that heart and keep smiling !
jawohl !
be sure to write home as soon as you' ve found a place .
dad !
can i please take the radio ?
mom , you said i could have his radio !
yeah !
well , that radio is yours now !
okay , now let me have a look at my little witch .
you look just like your mother did when she was your age .
daddy ... would you pick me up like you used to ?
well ...
how come you never told me you were growing up so fast ?
you can always come home if things don' t work out .
come back to my old room ?
no way !
i hope you find a good town .
i bet it' s real tough to find a town to live in by yourself .
don' t worry , kiki will be fine .
what kind of town are you looking for ?
a big town ?
yeah .
by the ocean i hope .
ohhh !
i' m so jealous of you !
but i' m not going for a good time .
i' il be training hard ... at least a year !
yeah but they' il have discos , won' t they ?
kiki , its almost time .
okay .
thats the broom you' re leaving on ?
yeah , i just made it .
pretty cute huh ?
it is cute , but you can' t start witchin on a broom that' s too small .
here , better take mine .
but mom , that one' s so old !
that' s why you should have it .
it never loses its way , even in a storm .
kiki , trust me .
but i worked so hard on it , right jiji ?
your mothers broom would be better .
you rotten traitor !
kiki , he' s right .
you can make yourself another broom when you get settled down .
be careful .
go , get ' em .
good bye !
go and have a good time !
go go !
kiki ...
go go !
kiki ...
she hasn' t quite got the hang of it yet .
she' s well past the lake and doing just fine .
i' m going to miss the sound of that little bell ...
which way are we headed ?
i think south , to the ocean .
jiji , climb up and turn on the radio .
i don' t think i can right now .
klki' s dellvery servlce
good evening !
it was ....
newcomer i suppose ?
i sure am .
i just left home tonight .
would you mind turning off that music ?
i prefer to fly without accompaniment .
is it really hard to get settled in a place you' ve never been ?
oh yes , lots can go wrong .
but since i' m good at fortune telling , i can handle everything .
fortunes ?
in fact , i' ve started telling fortunes about love lately .
whats your special skill ?
oh ...
i haven' t made up my mind yet .
uh huh ?
well , i' m nearly finished with my training period .
it' il be terrific to go home with confidence .
that' s my town down there .
it' s not big or terrible interesting , but i like it .
good luck to you .
thanks !
good bye !
disgusting .
what a stuck up cat .
i have to have a special skill .
what was that about good weather ?
i hope you' re not going to do , what i think you' re going to do ? !
we' il sleep here until the storm is gone .
won' t we get into trouble ?
not if nobody finds us .
i' m soaked thorugh .
do you fell anything moving ?
this smells great !
sorry .
we didn' t mean to fall asleep in your breakfast .
jiji , you' ve got to see the ocean !
i don' t belive it !
it' s huge !
it' s only a puddle to me .
aw , come on !
that one is giant .
think there might be other witches there ?
how would i know ?
let' s go !
jiji , you allright back there ?
look !
a big town by the sea !
can you belive my luck ?
a clocktower and everything !
what if there are some witches living here ?
there may not be .
am i gonna like it here !
it' s a little big for my taste .
bless my hourglass .
if that ain' t a witch !
good morning !
are there any other witches in this town ?
no , can' t say i' ve seen a single one of ' em lately .
how about that ?
our trip is over , we' il settle down here !
thanks mister !
bye !
don' t mention it .
tell me we' re not landing down there .
of course we do .
everybody is looking at us .
i know .
smile and make a good first impression .
well , you see , i' m a witch .
my name is kiki .
this is my black cat jiji .
we' d be honored of we could live here .
we' d love to live here .
you have a wonderful bell tower .
we' re glad you like it my dear .
bye !
hey kid , what were you doing jumping into the street like that ?
you almost caused an accident .
you must be crazy , zooming around on a broom in public !
i' m a new witch , sir .
we' re supposed to fly around .
you' re supposed to obey the law the same as all other people .
what' s your name and address ?
are you gonna tell my parents ?
of course .
if its necessary .
i have to .
you' re a minor .
thief !
somebody stop him !
stop , thief !
don' t you move from there !
kiki ....
wait !
it worked out pretty good huh ?
good plan to get rid of that cop , huh ?
i was the one yelling " thief !
you are a real witch , right ?
can i take a look at that broom ?
hey tombo !
isn' t it a bit early to go on girl hunting ?
hey you guys , shut up !
let me look at your broom , please ?
just for a minute .
i didn' t ask for your help .
i guess i have to thank you ... but it was rude from you to do something without introducing yourself ?
how old fashioned .
you sound like my grandma .
go away and leave me alone !
what a cool witch !
stay here alone ?
i don' t understand .
aren' t your parents here with you ?
no .
i' m a witch , so since i' m 13 , ...
i' m supposed to be completely independant .
may i see your indentification ?
never mind then .
are you going to eat that ?
you can have it .
its going to get dark fairly soon ...
let' s go .
let' s find another town .
there must be plenty like this one , perhaps even bigger .
lady !
your pacifier !
lady !
you forgot this !
what am i going to do ?
when that baby wakes up ... and doesn' t find this , it' s gonna cry .
i' m sorry , sir , but could you wait just a minute ?
i' il be right back .
should i bring it down to her ?
what ?
the woman with the baby carriage , right ?
it' d be easy .
i' d really like to .
that' d be a big help .
thank you very much .
my pleasure .
jiji , let' s go .
wow !
sorry to startle you ... but you left this pacifier in the bakery .
here you go .
i' d like one of those .
sure .
hi !
come on in !
thank you .
thank you .
bye .
there you go
i must say , i nearly fainted when i saw you fly off .
that woman told me to give you this message right away .
i got the pacifier you sent ...
be sure to thank your little friend .
she' s an absolute angel .
i' m glad i could help .
bye .
where are you going so fast ?
wait , please have something to drink !
come up here .
sit down and relax .
want some hot chocolate ?
yes ...
thank you .
and this is for you .
let me guess , you' re a witch in training ?
yes , but people don' t seem fond of witches in this town .
there are many kind people in this town who will like you .
take me for instance .
i like you very much .
have you found a place to stay yet ?
you should have told me you hadn' t .
we have a vavant room in the attic you can stay in .
you' d give me a room ? !
i' d be happy to .
let me introduce myself .
i' m , osono .
my name is kiki , and this is my cat jiji .
its not very clean at the moment , but its all yours .
thanks .
bathroom and water are downstairs .
don' t hesitate to ask for anything .
thank you !
there' s flour everywhere .
at this rate , i' il be a white cat by morning .
jiji , come take a look at the ocean from here .
shall we try to find another town ?
what a snob she is .
i' ve decided not to leave this town .
maybe i can find others like osono ... who will accept me for what i am .
how much do you think a phone would cost to put up here ?
a phone ?
yeah , for my business .
good morning everyone .
did you sleep well ?
yes .
that smells good .
can i help out ?
a delivery service , huh ?
i have one skill flying so i thought ... a delivery service would be a good idea .
everyone will love it .
kiki' s flying deivery service .
and you can base your business out of you room upstairs ... if you want to .
if i want to ? " oh boy !
i' d like to put a phone up there .
but a phone costs money .
i' ve some saved up already .
don' t waste it .
why not use our phone ?
it takes time to get regular costumers .
if you help in the bakery ... you won' t have to pay the phone bill .
i need a lot of help since i' m expecting a baby .
and i' il throw in free breakfast too .
thank you !
i' il do my very best for you !
you' re such a wonderful person .
jiji , come on !
i' m all alone .
it' s time to go shopping .
stop jumping out on the street .
we' re not at home .
i' m sorry .
i won' t do it again .
i wish i had something pretty to wear besides this robe .
boy , this is expensive ...
kiki , look , its me !
do you have any money left ?
a little .
we just have to eat pancakes for a while .
wow !
those are beautiful .
wait !
pull over a second .
hey yo !
miss witch !
turn around !
no flying today ?
what did i tell you ?
black is all she wears .
wait !

i' m sorry , i was only kidding !
kiki , perfect timing .
a lady wants you to deliver something .
she' s your first customer .
customer ?
i' il be right back !
the map !
this lady is a customer of ours .
we were talking about your delivery service .
you are a cute little witch .
my name is kiki , ma' am .
i' ve heard wonderful things about you .
could you deliver this tonight ?
yes .
it' s my nephews birthday .
and urgent job came so i can' t get there myself .
where do you want it delivered ?
thats me ....
it won' t be too far ?
i ca fly there directly from here .
how much do you want ?
i haven' t really set a price yet .
is this enough ?
this is more than ehough .
thank you very much ma' am .
oh wow !
that' s great .
i certainly wish that i could fly ...
yeah !
hey , do you know that girl ?
how high do you intend to go ?
its my first delivery .
i don' t want to be stopped by that police officer .
i was afraid you were going to deliver this to the angels .
i' m guessing its just beyond the cape .
here we go !
jiji , i' m liking this town more and more .
i' m not suer what i think .
i' il finally be able to write mom .
those are wild geese .
wonderful !
they' re flying along with us !
why are they so upset ?
they say a wind is comming .
they also say they' re going higher .
i' m sorry !
i oww , oww !
please !
i' m sorry !
i wasn' t trying to steal your eggs !
i' ve never been so scared .
its your fault .
they warned us of that wind , but you didn' t listen .
you' re right .
that' s beautiful .
they were able to fly that high up with the wind .
kiki !!
the toy is gone !
what ?
oh no !
we' ve got to get back to where we fell !
they' re saying " the egg thief is coming again !
what are we gonna do ?
hey !
don' t do that !
stop it !
stop it !
go away !
we' re in trouble .
they' re still upset .
witches get no respect these days .
crows used to be witches servants .
that was a long time ago , okay ?
how about we go in after the forest is dark , get in and get out ?
we' il never make it in time .
there' s only one way to do it .
they' il find out i' m a fake !
after i find it , i' il be right back to help you out .
is that the place ?
yes .
don' t move a muscle .
can i breathe ?
hold it as long as you can .
yea !
give me my present !
that' s pretty weird .
a bit late aren' t you ?
after my sister telephoned we were wondering where you were .
i' m sorry .
oh .
could i please have your signature ?
mom , can i put the canaries in here ?
uh huh , but be careful you don' t let any of them escape .
okay .
thank you , have a nice day .
come on birdie !
i' m gonna put you in a bigger house !
kiki , please hurry !
i know it was here , so it' s gotta be around somplace .
there it is !
excuse me , anybody home ?
can you please help me ?
anybody ?
anybody here ?
yeah !
i can' t come down right now .
but why don' t you come up ?
what do you want ?
that stuffed black cat you put behind your window ?
i' m sorry , but its mine .
i dropped it .
be good , and don' t move yet .
i found it in the forest .
would you give it back to me , please ?
hang on a minute , i just can' t stop just now .
nice , very nice .
you' re beautiful just the way you are .
you really should have told me you were in a hurry .
i got sort of fond of it .
i' m sorry .
the stuffing is coming out !
i' d bet the crows did it .
they were making a big fuss over it .
what am i gonna do ?
i can' t deliver it like this .
say , how about we work out a deal ?
that' s pretty exciting .
and at 13 too !
to be completely independant .
that' s great .
can you fix it ?
trust me .
ketto !
ketto !
time for your bath .
the guests will be here soon !
ketto !
i' m done !
thank you so much !
you' d better help jiji before it' s too late !
but i haven' t finished yet .
you' ve done enough .
go help him !
thanks !
jeff likes my present more than me !
it is strange you know .
he adores that stuffed cat .
he won' t leave it alone .
he thinks its a puppy ?
your sister is not going to be happy to hear that .
thats okay .
i gave it to jeff anyway .
remember to tell auntie " thank you " .
you should be nice to him .
jeff is a very old dog .
but grandma , all he does is sleep !
ketto , go open the door .
jeff wants to go out .
be sure to push the door shut when you finished .
jiji !
what took you so long ?
i' m sorry .
that marvelous dog helped me escape .
he said he' d be happy to help us out if he could .
would you take this back in ?
whats the matter ?
i' m famished .
yeah , me too .
and i' m tired too .
but it sure was a wonderful adventure .
and that painter ... who found the stuffed cat wants to do a drawing with me in it .
naked ?
don' t be silly .
