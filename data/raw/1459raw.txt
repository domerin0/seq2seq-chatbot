he' s not thinking straight .
we gotta stop him from making the biggest mistake of his life !
he' s probably out there lost and cold .
confused .
poor little guy .
melman , come on !
you know , maybe one of us should wait here , in case he comes back .
oh no , not now .
this is an intervention melman , we all gotta go !
what' s the fastest way to grand central ?
you should take lexington .
melman !
okay . we ..
we should take lexington .

and just where are you giants from ?
we' re from new york and we ...

excuse me , we bozos have the people of course .
hey , the bozos have the people !
oh .
well .
great !
good !
they' re up there .
don' t you love the people ?
not a very lively bunch though .
so do you have any live people ?
no .
only dead ones .
i mean if we had a lot alive people here , it wouldn' t be called ' the wild ' , would it ?
the wild ?
hold up there a second ... a fuzzbucket ...
you mean like the " living in mud hut , wipe yourself with leaf " type wild ?
who wipes ?
would you excuse me for a moment ?
get me out of here !
we gotta get out of here !
alex !
help !
what are you doing ?
i' m swimming back to new york !
i know my chances are slim , but i have to try !
you can' t swim !
i said : " my chances are slim " !
nature !
it' s all over me !
get it off !
i can' t see !
i can' t see !
i can see !
okay look , there' s obviously just been a little mistake .
i' m sure the people didn' t dump us here on purpose .
as soon as they realize what happened , they will come looking for us , right ?
yeah , right .
you know something ?
i bet they are already on their way .
2500 mlles south
well boys , it' s gonna be ice cold sushi for breakfast .
rico !
well , since i' m doomed to die on this forsaken island ,
i , melman mankowitz being of sound mind and unsound body have divided my estate equally among the three of you .
oh , sorry alex .
hey !
a latrine .
nice work , melman .
outdoor plumbing .
no , it' s not a latrine , it' s a grave .
you sent melman to his grave , are you happy ?
oh , come on .
this is not the end .
this is the whole new beginning !
this could be the best thing that' s ever happened to us !
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
this is not the best thing that' s ever happened to us !
yeah !
you' ve abused the power of the birthday wish and brought this bad luck on all of us .
why did you tell your wish ?
you' re not supposed to do that !
wait a minute , i didn' t want to tell you .
remember ?
you guys made me tell you .
besides , this isn' t bad luck , this is good luck .
look around .
there' s no fences , no schedules , this place is beautiful !
ok !
ok !
i' ve had enough of this ...
this is your side of the island , and this is our side of the island .
that is the bad side where you can prance and skip around like a magical pixie horse .
and do whatever the hack you wanna do all day long .
and this , this is the good side of the island , for those who love new york and care about going home .
come on .
no , no .
back , back .
back !
you know what , this isn' t good .
okay !
you all have your side , and i' il have mine .
and if you need me , i' il be over here .
on the fun side of the island .
having a good old time !
this is the fun side !
this is the fun side !
we' re all gonna have a great time surviving until we go home !
i love this side !
this side is the best !
that side stinks !
you' re on the jersey side of this cesspool !
well now what do we do ?
don' t worry melman i have a plan to get us rescued .
can' t wait to see that look on marty' s face when he sees this !
just look at him , he' s helpless without us .
shut up , spalding !
i' ve been standing here for hours man !
how long do i have to pose like this ?
she is finito !
i defy any rescue boat within a million miles to miss this baby !
when the moment is right , we will ignite the beacon of the liberty !
and be rescued from this awful nightmare !
what do you think ?
pretty cool , ha ?
how' s the liberty fire going , melman ?
great !
idiot .
i heard that .
why can' t we just borrow some of marty' s fire ?
that' s wild fire !
we' re not using wild fire on lady liberty !

the foosa are attacking !
to serve lemur
it' s a good book !
please , please .
maurice .
shh !
quiet !
come on you all !
they ain' t attacking us this very instant !
so my genious plan is this .
we will make the new york giants our friends .
and keep them close .
then with mr. alex protecting us , we will be safe and never have to worry about the dreaded foosa !
ever again !
i thought of that !
i thought of that !
yes !
me !
hold on , hold on everybody .
i' m just thinking now .
i mean does anyone wonder why the foosa was so scared of mr. alex ?
i mean ...
maybe we should be scared too !
what if mr. alex is even worse than the foosa ?
i' m telling you that dude just gives me the heebiedabajeebies .
maurice , you did not raise your hand .
therefore your heinous comment will be stricken from the record .
does anyone else have the heebiejeebies ?
no !
good .
so shut up !
when the new york giants wake up , we will make sure , that they wake up in paradise .
now who' d like a cookie ?
help

he' s clearly a tender loving thing .
how can you have the heebiejeebies for mr. alex .
look at him .
he' s so cute and plushy .
i don' t think he was grooming him , julian .
looked more like he was tasting him to me .
suit yourself , no matter .
i don' t care .
soon we will put my excellent plan to action .
all we have to do is wait until they' re deep in their sleep .

i haven' t eaten in two days .
my blood sugar is real low .
i just don' t have the energy .
i don' t think that' s your problem .
first of all that' s not how you run in the wild .
let' s go man !

you just have to let up that inner lion !
now , who' s the cat ?
marty , i really don' t ...

you see , maurice alex is now a friend and the foosas are nowhere to be seen .
it could be said that my plan is working in a very good workin ' kind of way .
alex , you gotta try some of this !
i feel good !
i feel like a king again !
king ?
yeah !
you should see his act !
come on alex , why don' t you show him some of your act ?
no , i really don' t think i can ...
okay .
ladies and gentlemen , primates of all ages , the wild proudly presents the king !
alex the lion !
e flat , fellows !
yeah !
the king is in the house !
if he' s a king , then where' s his crown ?
i' ve got the crown .

that' s dumb .
dumb , dumb , maurice .
what is the simple bite on the buttocks among friends ?
here .. give me a nibble ..
the party is over , julian .
your brilliant plan has failed .
what are you talking about ?
your friend here is what we call a deluxe model hunting and eating machine .
and he eats steak .
which is you .
get out of here .
okey dokey , maurice .
i admit it , the plan failed .
all is lost !
we' re all doomed .
the foosas will come back and gobble us with their mouths !
because we are all steak .
i' m steak !
me , me , me , me !
mr. alex cannot stay here .
he belongs with his own kind .
on the foosa side of the island .
by the power invested in me , by the law of the jungle , bla , bla , bla , bla .
be gone !
what ?
come on .
do i look like a steak to you ?
yeah .
see , i told you i don' t look like ...
wait , wait , what did you say ?
oh , yeah !
he' s going savage .
run for your lives !

i' m a monster .
i gotta get out of here .
foosa territory 1 mile
what have i done ?
this is a nightmare !
it' s all my fault .
now because of me we' ve lost alex .
what are we gonna do ?
we' re gonna find the way to help him , that' s what we' re gonna do .
come on , we are new yorkers , right ?
we' re tough .
we' re gritty .
we' re adoptable !
and we are not going to lay down like a bunch of melmans !

embarking into hostile environment .
kowalski .
we' il need to win the hearts and the minds of the natives .
