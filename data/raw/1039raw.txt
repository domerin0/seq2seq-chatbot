this will be the final boarding call for flight 2 ... to london , heathrow .
okay .
i' m not even gonna say it , kate .
then it' il be like i never left .
okay ?
wait .
i have a really bad feeling about this .
about the plane ?
you think it' s gonna crash ?
don' t say that .
no .
look , i know that we' ve talked about this a thousand times , and we agreed that going to london was the right thing to do .
but in my heart ... this feels wrong .
don' t go , jack .
you mean don' t go at all ?
well , what what about my internship ?
believe me , i know i know what an incredible opportunity this is for you .
for us , kate .
right , for us .
but i' m afraid that if you get on that plane look .
we' re at the airport .
nobody ever thinks clearly at the airport .
so we should just trust the decision we already made .
you' ve been accepted to one of the best law schools in the country .
i' ve got this internship at barclay' s bank .
we have a great plan , honey .
you wanna do something great , jack ?
let' s flush the plan .
let' s start our lives right now , today .
i mean , i have no idea what this life is gonna look like , but i know that it has the both of us in it , and i choose us .
the plan doesn' t make us great , jack .
what we have together , that' s what makes us great .
i love you , kate .
i love you too .
i do .
and one year in london is not gonna change that .
a hundred years couldn' t change that .
experts are predicting a mild rally in the bond market .
last night was incredible .
huh ?
i said , last night was great .
you are an amazing lover .
thanks .
you' re not bad yourself .
i wanna see you again .
i' d like that too .
tonight .
it' s christmas eve , jack .
so ?
i' il pour eggnog over you .
i have to go visit my parents out in jersey .
jersey ?
do you have any idea what the traffic' s gonna be like ?
that' s why i' m taking the train .
it was nice meeting you , jack .

mrs. peterson .
hello , jack .
you don' t have to stop singing on my account .
oh , it' s because i' m shy , betty .
so , when are you gonna leave that old corpse , mr. peterson , and run away with me ?
you know you could never satisfy me the way he does .
ah .
merry christmas , mr. campbell .
how' d you make out this year , tony ?
about four grand , and a bottle of 25 year old scotch from 9d .
i' m putting it all in commercial paper like you said .
good , but just until the deutsche mark turns .
thank you , mr. campbell .

good morning , joe .

if med tech shares fall any lower than 43 , we' re in trouble with the stock valuations .

i promised i' d be home for dinner .
it' s christmas eve , jack .
oh , is that tonight ?
you think i like being here on christmas eve , alan ?
no .
well , maybe .
okay .
okay , maybe i do have a touch of tunnel vision this holiday season .
but in two days we' re going to announce ... one of the largest mergers in u. s. corporate history .
when a deal like this turns up , you get on it and you ride it till it' s over .
you don' t ask it for a vacation .
december 26 .
after that there' il be so much money floating around here , it' il be like christmas every day .
december 26 , people .
if you' d like to celebrate that day , you all have my blessing .
you' re right .
i' m sorry .
i don' t want you to be sorry .
i want you to be excited .
i want my gift to you to be the first gift you open this year .
you know why ?
because my gift comes with ten zeroes .
you' re right .
i' m focused .
i' m there .
good man .
everybody , turn to page 12 in your prospectus .
you have six messages .
two of them are imperative .
whoa .
i' m going home .
i' m not even here now .
good night .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
it' s only 8 : 30 .
i' m disappointed .

ooh , my suits are ready .
mm hmm .

i almost married her .

and almost a broker at e. f. hutton .

she didn' t want me to go to london .
we' re standing at the airport saying good bye , and she asked me to stay .
so you left her .
wasn' t easy .
oh , stop it .
i' m getting all weepy .
i took the road less traveled , adelle .
and look where it took ya .
i' m gonna get this gal on the phone .
nope .
you almost married this woman .
you' re not even curious why she called ?
she' s probably just having a fit of nostalgia .
lonely christmas eve .
called the one that got away .
why call her back and mislead her ?
this happened a very , very long time ago .
8 : 35 on christmas eve .
jack campbell still at his desk .
now there' s a hallmark moment for you .
peter , i don' t see you rushing home to trim the tree .
that' s because i' m a heartless bastard who only cares about money .
well , you know what ?
god love you for that .
got a call from terry haight .
bob thomas is nervous .
that' il happen when you' re about to spend $130 billion on some aspirin .

hey , peter , let me ask you a question .
an old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on christmas eve .
what do you do ?
you suddenly having trouble getting dates ?
yeah .

old flames are like old tax returns put ' em in the file cabinet for three years , and then you cut ' em loose .
i' il leave from my office tomorrow in the afternoon .
call the group .
schedule an emergency strategy session for noon .
that' il be a nice little holiday treat .
good night , frank .
hey , mr. campbell .

come on .
come on .
you' re probably gonna wanna buckle up , jack .
this thing moves .
## [ ends ]
what' s happening to me ?
breathe into the bag , jack .
this kind of thing makes a lot of guys have to throw up .
i seen it happen before .
so if you feel the urge , you roll down the window and do it out there .
try not to get so worked up , jack .
after all , you brought this on yourself .
brought what on myself ?
i didn' t do anything ! " i got everything i need .
that sound familiar ?
you mean ' cause you thought i was cocky , i' m now on a permanent acid trip ?
bag yourself , jack .
oh , my god !
ah !
the way you intervened in that store last night , you did a good thing there , jack .
i mean , it was incredibly impressive all the way across the board ...
oh , god ! to the upper echelons of the organization .
please just tell me what' s happening to me in plain english ... without the mumbo jumbo .
this is a glimpse , jack .
a glimpse ?
i a glimpse of what ?
you' re gonna have to figure that out for yourself and you got plenty of time .
how much time ?
as much time as it takes , which in your case is probably gonna be considerable .
okay , look , look .
i i i just want my life back , okay ?
now , what' s it gonna take ?
you wanna talk turkey ?
let' s talk turkey .
how much money ?
it doesn' t work like that , and i can' t tell you why .
why not ?
because you have to figure this thing out for yourself .
are you listening to me ?
figure it out , figure it out .
figure out what ?
let it come to you , man .
i don' t have time for this right now .
i' m in the middle of a deal .
well , you' re working on a new deal now , baby .
what' s this ?

you and me , buddy , we know how to live , huh ?
come on .

come on
whoo !
come on , buddy .
take your seat .
are you okay ?
i mean , you take off christmas morning and you don' t tell anyone where you' re going .
we' re friends ?
talk to me .
i' m having kind of a bad day .
you know , i read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holiday .
what am i saying that for ?
you don' t wanna hear that .
come on .
is it is it trouble at work ?
i i don' t think so .
well , it' s not kate , is it ?
you see , huh ?
it' s like we' re inside each other' s heads .
kate' s my wife .
just keep saying it over and over again , jack , like a mantra .
keep saying it .
look , you know , you fit the profile exactly in your 30s , house , kids , financial responsibilities .
you start thinking this isn' t the life i dreamt about .
where' s the romance , you know ?
where' s the joie de vivre ?
suddenly every lingerie ad in the newark star ledger ... represents a life that you can' t have .
it' s just two kids , right ?
come on .
come on .
all right , sometimes it feels like you gave up the whole world .
i know that .
but look what you got .
look at that : four bedrooms , two and a half baths , a partially finished basement .
and good kids .
look .
you know what ?
you probably don' t wanna hear this right now .
but remember last summer when i almost had that thing with arnie , jr . ' s speech therapist ?
you remember what you said to me ?
you said , " don' t screw up the best thing in your life ... just because you' re a little unsure about who you are .
okay ?
go get ' em , tiger .
could you hold on a second ?
um , never mind because because he just walked in .
thank you .
thank you .
do you ... have any idea what you put us through today ?
you walk out of here at 7 : 30 in the morning .
you don' t tell me where you' re going , or even that you' re going .
and i don' t see you till hours later ?
i called all of our friends .
i had the state troopers looking for you .
i was on the phone with the hospital , for god' s sakes .
what kind of man leaves his family christmas morning without a word about where he' s going ?
what kind of a man does that , jack ?
i don' t know .
could you could you please stop yelling at me ?
where were you ?
i was in the city .
the city ?
new york city ?
yeah .
why ?
because that' s where i live .
don' t start , jack .

you missed christmas , jack .
i' m sorry .
you know , we don' t even have enough time for this .
and at least you' re okay .
i' m okay , we' re okay .
but you' ve gotta get dressed for the thompson party .
and you are not wearing that .
i don' t care how hilarious you think it is .
party ?
no , i' m not going to a party .
you look forward to this party all year .
what is it with you today ?
believe me , kate .
i really don' t think that going to a party ... is the right move for me at the present time .
okay , fine .
you know what ?
then you just do whatever you wanna do .
what are you doing ?
telling my mother she doesn' t have to stay with the kids .
why not ?

jack , you' re needed in mag wheels .
customer waiting .
i was the number one junior sales associate for e. f. hutton in 1988 .
did you know that ?
uh , no .
no , i didn' t .
that' s great .
that' s the kind of thing you could really build on , you know ?
uh huh .
yeah .
i mean , sales has always been a feeder for m& a. always .
uh huh .
well , look , here we are .
the mag wheels .
mag wheels .
oh .
so .
hey , jack , um , are you sure you' re okay ?
well , i' m just a little confused right now about why i work here .
uh [ chuckles ]
i just started here last tuesday , so
the closing tip was a mildly bullish plus 76 .
much of the market' s action today was fueled by the latest round of merger mania ... to hit wall street ... when global health systems and med tech pharmaceutical announced their intentions ... to join forces in a massive $122 billion stock swap deal , the largest ever in the health care industry .
when asked about the possible anti competitive implications ,
global chairman bob thomas referred reporters ... to p. k. lassiter & company president alan mintz , the architect behind the deal .
that' s my deal !
ironically , mintz first met thomas at a lamaze class .
while coaching their pregnant wives , mintz and thomas ...
what ? struck up a dialog , and two months later , the deal with med tech was born .
he wasn' t the architect !
i' m the architect !
labor department officials announced today that 275, 000 new jobs have been created .
the kids are asleep .
the kids , hon .
honey .
sweetheart , i said the kids are asleep .
that' s just great .
those little monkeys can be a real handful .
hey , i was watching that .
not tonight .
## [ stereo ]
please leave my socks alone .
wait .
you want me .
that is the general idea , yeah .
oh , well , maybe we should grab a bottle of wine first .
kind of break the ice .
yeah , that' s very funny .
look , it' s 10 : 30 .
by 11 : 00 you' re gonna be snoring like a monster , but that' s very sweet .
i' il remember that for next time .
whatever you say ... honey .
yeah .
# strange what desire will make foolish people do #
# i never dreamed that i' d need somebody #
# like you #
oh , god , you' re beautiful .
thanks , jack .
no , i' m serious .
you' re really stunning .
this is good stuff .
i want you to keep this up .
you were always a very pretty girl in college .
there' s no question about that .
but this [ sighs ]
you' ve really grown into a beautiful woman .
how can you do that ?
what ?
look at me like you haven' t seen me every day for the last 13 years .
okay , wait .
don' t move .
don' t look .
stay right there .
i got something .
# the world was on fire #
# no one could save me but you # [ whispering ]
good night , sweetheart .
# strange what desire #
# will make foolish people do ##
## [ stops ]
okay , we' re almost out of here .
mary janes , mommy .
you promised .
that' s right .
i did promise .
okay .
all right .
we' re gonna stop at the kids ' shoe department first , and then i gotta pick up my watch from the battery store .
then i' m gonna go to the linen store .
why don' t we go to all the stores ?
every single store in this god forsaken shopping mall .
wouldn' t that be exciting ?
you know what ?
why don' t i take the kids , and you just stay here and hang out in the men' s department ?
come on , hon .
it' s perfect for your frame .
why don' t you try it on ?
i might want to take an inch out of the back .
okay .
lengthen the sleeve .
you look amazing in that suit .
i mean , really wow !
off the charts , great .
it' s an unbelievable thing .
wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person .
i' m gonna buy it .
it' s $2 , 400 .
are you out of your mind ?
come on , let' s go .
she got those shoes .
those shoes were $25 .
come on .
take it off , all right ?
we' il go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like .
daddy' s a crazy guy .
no .
no .
do you have any idea what my life is like ?
excuse me ?
i wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva .
i drop the kids off , spend eight hours selling tires retail .
retail , kate .
i pick the kids up , walk the dog , which , by the way , carries the added bonus ... of carting away her monstrous crap .
i play with the kids , take out the garbage , get six hours of sleep if i' m lucky .
then everything starts all over again .
so what' s in it for me ?
wh where are my mary janes ?
you know , it' s sad to hear that your life is such a disappointment to you .
i can' t believe it isn' t a disappointment to you !
jesus , kate , i could have been a thousand times the man i became .
i could have been one of the richest forbes
how could you do this to me ?
how could you let me give up on my dreams like this ?
really , i want to know .
who are you ?
all right , look .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry i was such a saint before ... and i' m such a prick now !
but maybe i' m just not ... the same guy that i was when we got married .
you know what ?
maybe you' re not .
because the jack campbell i married would not need a $2 , 400 suit ... to feel better about his life .
but i' m telling you , if that' s what it' s gonna take , then buy it .
jesus !
we ' il take the money out of the kids ' college fund .
forget it .
we' il get a funnel cake .
it' il be the highlight of my week .
listen , i' m really sorry about that back in the store .
i don' t want to fight with you .
i just sometimes wonder how we ended up here , you know .
i mean , back in college , d did you see us here ?
life has thrown us a few surprises .
i' il give you that .
it really has , hasn' t it ?
yeah .
so , if you had to , what would you say was the biggest surprise ?
just out of curiosity .
i' m just asking .
well , annie , for one .
surprise , we' re pregnant .
yeah , that must have been .
i mean , that that was .
that was a very unexpected moment .
what are you gonna do ?
i think it turned out all right , don' t you ?
yeah .
i really like annie .
well , good , jack .
maybe we' il keep her .
no , i love her .
i love annie .
i' m just
we had a lot of good times , didn' t we ?
do you remember the place on charles street where we used to go ?
charles street ?
in the village ?
when we were living in greenwich village .
yeah .
yeah , yeah .
great times .
great place .
why did we ever leave ?
you can' t really raise a kid in an apartment in the village .
then there was the whole trek out to the hospital .
that didn' t help either .
you were great .
i mean , surviving the heart attack was one thing .
you had a heart attack ?
hey , jack , stop that .
' cause i am i' m still mad at you .
who knows what would have happened if you hadn' t stepped in at the store ?
that' s why i work for big ed .
that' s why i work for big ed .
yeah .
so we had a baby , big ed had a heart attack .
bought that house , and i' ve been working for him ever since .
sayonara , wall street .
our life in a nutshell .
if you want to look at it that way .
how would you look at it ?
a great success story .
what do you say , jack ?
show ' em how to do it , baby .
jack , we need a strike .
damn !
jesus , jack .
what are you doing ?
it' s a league match .
where' s your follow through ?
where' s your stance ?
you know what ?
i' m doing the best i can .
it' s okay , jack .
why am i so competitive all the time ?
you can still pick up that spare .
crack ' em , jack !
here we go .
hurt ' em .
you' re jack campbell .
you' re better than the sport .
you shot the rapids in kanai .
you ran with the bulls in pamplona .
you' ve jumped out of an airplane over the mojave desert , for christ' s sake .
you can do this .
you can do this .
you can do this .
you can do this .
yes !
victorious !
ha ha ?
ah ha ?
huh ?
all right !
high five !
you' re up .
go get ' em .
hi , jack .
evelyn , right ?
very funny .
i saw you on lane 20 .
you got the flu or something ?
something like that , yeah .
need a nurse ?
are you a nurse ?
if that' s what you want .
hey , wait a minute .
um , don' t run away .
are we
are we what , jack ?
well
is there something going on between us ?
are we finally being honest ?
it would help me if we were .
okay .
you' re right .
we' ve been dancing around this for years .
here goes .
when i get dressed for a party , and i know you' re gonna be there ,
let' s just say i don' t go strapless because my husband likes it .
i' ve got six sets of snow tires piled up in my garage , and i won' t even drive in the snow .
and our kids just happen to be ... in the same ballet class every year .
so , if you' re asking whether i' d like it to be more , the answer' s yes .
kate would never have to know .
do i have your number ?
steve' s out of town with the kids this weekend .
why don' t you just stop by ?
hey , jack .
you' re all flushed .
i feel good .
guess that 71 took a lot out of you .
no .
i just saw evelyn thompson .
she' s relentless .
she wants to have an affair with me .
she said that ?
pretty much .
what is it about you ?
so ... if you would write her exact address down there .
you have a pen ?
please .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
hold on a second .
you' re not actually thinking about cheating on kate ?
well , it wouldn' t really be cheating , arnie .
it' s complicated .
it' s complicated .
maybe i haven' t been as good a consigliere as you' ve been to me , but hear me out on this .
a little flirtation is harmless , but you' re dealing with fire here , man .
the fidelity bank and trust is a tough creditor .
you make a deposit somewhere else , they close your account ... forever , all right ?
arnie , i don' t want your head to explode , but i' m telling you , those rules don' t apply to me .
i i' m not even
i' m not talking about rules .
i' m talking about
y you' re
there isn' t a guy in union county who wouldn' t give his left nut ... to be with kate , all right ?
she' s amazing , and you' re gonna fuck it up .
just think about that , all right ?
hey , honey .
how was the game ?
long and boring and generally pretty sad .
arnie seemed to enjoy it .
sort of .
hey , where' s that chocolate cake ?
do you mean this chocolate cake ?
that' s my piece .
i was saving it because i got nauseated by that precooked mini mall rotisserie chicken .
mmm .
mmm .
it' s good .
give me that cake .
no way .
come on .
i' m sorry .
it' s too important to me .
# ta da ##
i want that cake !
you want this cake ?
i want it .
thank you .
it' s good , right ?
mm hmm .
oh , god !
are the kids asleep ?
mm hmm .
mm .
mmm .
mmm .
say it to me , jack .
what ?
you know what i like to hear .
i know , baby .
i know what you like to hear .
tell me .
tell me , tell me .
you' re a bad girl , baby .
you make me so hot .
what ?
not it ?
nice , jack .
what ?
sweeping me off my feet .
you make me hot .
what do you say , everyone ?
this is a little birthday party for katie .
happy birthday , katie .
good to see you kids still together .
hello , kids .
happy birthday .
very exciting .
evelyn , you look tremendous .
thank you .
look what happens when i do that .
jack ?
the man .
yes .
yes .
do you have anything to say to your lovely wife on the day of her birth ?
you happy she was born ?
hey , hey !
today' s your birthday ?
that' s funny , jack .
you know what ?
wow , your birthday .
it' s you' re my wife .
you are my wife .
today is your birthday .
well , actually , i do have one thing that i want to say to you .
and god , i hope you like it .
bill ?
##
oh , no .
yes .
you hit it , bill .
you wore that shirt last year , by the way .
just so you know .
# many guys have come to you #
# with a line that wasn' t true # oh !
# and you passed them by #
# passed them by #
# now you' re in the centering and their lines don' t mean a thing #
# why don' t you let me try #
# let me try #
# now , i don' t wear a diamond ring #
# i don' t even have a song to sing #
# all i know is la la la la la la la la la #
# means i love you #
# la la la la la la la la la #
# means i love you #
## [ piano continues ]
ahh !
sweet .
# the things i am saying are true ooh ooh #
# and the way i explain it to you # [ chuckling ]
get down , jack .
# yes , to you #
# listen to me la la la la #
# la la la la la means #
# i love you #
# ohh #
# la la la la la la la la la #
# means i love you ##
happy birthday , sweetheart .
yeah .
yeah , jack !
there' s love in the air .
he loves her .
it' s official .
there' s love .
mmm .
come on , it' s time to get up , honey .
go , go .
good morning , joshie .
happy anniversary , honey .
now , listen , before you do whatever crazy stunt you' ve got planned ,
i want you to open mine first .
maybe i should wait .
no !
come on !
come on , come on , come on .
open it .
zeena ?
i found it at an outlet store .
look , i know it' s a knock off , but i think it' s gonna look great on you .
you
ah , enjoy it , sweetheart .
uh
yeah , uh you' re probably expecting something from me .
um , here' s the thing .
i hadn' t really planned on giving you your anniversary gift ... until tonight .
you know , anniversary' s good all day .
what are you talking about ?
you can never wait all day .
you can' t even wait till it' s light out .
come on !
i know .
i know .
that' s me .
it' s true .
and but , um , it' s funny .
you forgot .
you actually forgot our anniversary .
i' il fix it .
i' il go out right now and i' il get you something .
i' il make it right .
let me know if there' s enough chocolate in there , sweetheart .
mm , not bad .
good .
i should have warned you .
dad always does something really special for the anniversary .
like what ?
one year he had a star named after her .
he had a star named after her ?
well , that' s nice , but isn' t that a little ... corny ?
mom liked it .
maybe there' s a jewelry store at the mall .
i can pick her up a pair of earrings or something .
that' s good , but ... you did forget the anniversary .
that' s right .
that is a major oversight .
okay , okay .
so , if i' m kate , i can' t afford the finer things .
my husband' s career is definitely a crushing disappointment to me .
i' m trapped in suburbia .
did he ever take her to the city ?
now you' re getting the hang of it .
## [ piano ]
## [ piano continues ]
jack , can we afford this place ?
i' m taking my baby out for our anniversary .
damn the costs .
we' il have the terrine of quail breast with shiitake mushrooms to start .
then the veal medallions in raspberry truffle sauce .
and the sea scallops with pureed artichoke hearts .
very good , sir .
and may i say , those are all excellent selections .
you may .
also , we' il have a bottle of lafite , ' 82 .
honey , that' s an $800 bottle of wine .
we' il just have some red wine by the glass .
you are so not off the hook yet , slick .
but i' m getting close , right ?
you wanna dance ?
i i don' t think there' s dancing here , jack .
sure , there is .
come on .
not bad for a tire salesman from new jersey .
i have my moments .
you gotta try one of these .
ahh .
god , i miss that taste .
i need to tell you something .
okay .
i think it may help us , but there' s a slight chance it could make things worse .
i' m living someone else' s
i feel like i' m living someone else' s life .
i remember i used to walk to work , and , uh ,
i had a warm bialy in my hand , and a hot cup of coffee from dean & deluca , the crisp feeling of the wall street journal , the smell of leather from my briefcase .
i used to be so sure about everything , confident .
you know , i i knew exactly who i was ... and what i wanted .
and then one morning , i woke up ... and suddenly it was all different .
worse , do you mean ?
no .
well , maybe a few things , but mostly just different .
and it' s okay .
but i never used to be like this , kate .
i was the guy who had it all figured out .
i had no doubts .
i had no regrets .
and now ?
now i don' t .
i don' t have it all figured out .
me neither .
but you always seem so certain .
do you think there aren' t mornings when i wake up ... and wonder , " what the hell am i doing in new jersey ?
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
my office is a dump .
i answer my own phone , and you seen my paycheck .
your paycheck is a disgrace to paychecks .
can you imagine a life ... where everything was just easy ?
you know , where you ask for things , and people just bring them to you ?
it' s wonderful .
i think about it too .
i do .
i wonder about what kind of life i would have had if i hadn' t married you .
and ?
then i realize i' ve just erased all the things in my life that i' m sure about .
you and the kids .
good things .
yeah .
what are you sure about ?
i' m sure that right now , there' s nowhere else i' d rather be than here with you .
oh .
oh , jack .
you like it ?
ohh .
this is beautiful .
you know champagne makes me do crazy things .
i' il just fill yours up to the top .
i don' t know how you did it , hoss , but you pulled it off .
i' m out of the doghouse ?
way out .
happy anniversary , sweetheart .
you may even get lucky tonight , jack .
you' re so beautiful .
i already told you you were gonna get lucky .
my god .
all this time ,
i never stopped loving you .
that' s all i wanted to hear .
twinkle , twinkle , little star " ]
## [ humming ]
i' m gonna wear the usual today .
what are you thinking ?
you want to come to work with dad , help me sell tires ?
it' s fun .
i' m pretty good at it .
who' s this ?
who' s that ?
who is that ?
who' s on that tie ?
that' s grandpa .
yes .
jack !
mmm .
have a great day .
for the money , this is hands down the best radial we carry .
okay .
i guess i' il take ' em .
you won' t regret it .
tommy .
would you set mr. collin up with four b. f. goodrich g force t. a. ' s ?
give him ten percent off for having the best costume .
thank you .
you bet .
right this way , sir .
follow me .
tell me , does the tire smell good ?
remember our valentine' s day special : balance and alignment for free !
how are you doing today ?
it just blew out on me .
do you have a tire like that ?
i seem to have some sort of a blowout here .
why don' t you let me take this one , kenny ?
okay , chief .
peter lassiter .
do i know you ?
not exactly .
i' ve seen you on cn bc .
you look taller in real life .
truth is , mintz was so busy timing his wife' s breathing , he didn' t realize that med tech needed global more than the other way around .
ten days , two weeks tops , they would have approached you with an offer .
i' m willing to bet anything it would have been 130 billion , not 122 .
the trouble is , peter , you had a pussycat running the show .
what you needed was a doberman .
i' m impressed .
i really am .
now , about my car .
sure .
we' re gonna have to special order that tire , so it' il be ready in a couple of days .
all right .
this is my office address .
why don' t you drop off the car yourself ?
we' re really more of a boutique operation , as you can see .
but you' re not interested in boutique dollars .
i get it .
he' s expecting you , mr. lassiter .
alan , this is jack campbell , the one i was telling you about .
of course .
jack .
hi .
mr. mintz .
no , just call me alan .
we like to cultivate a very casual atmosphere here .
i can see that .
what can i tell you ?
do you have kids ?
uh , actually , yes .
two of them .
good ones .
great , great .
why don' t you have a seat ?
peter mentioned to me that you' re an avid cn bc watcher .
but he didn' t say whether you had any actual wall street experience .
um , i was a sales associate at e. f. hutton .
a broker , really ?
and now you' re in the tire business ?
that' s right .
and auto supply .
in the retail end , i understand .
we get about 60 percent of our business from automotive service .
and do you mind me asking what kind of sales you did in the last year ?
just ball park .
we did 1 . 7 million in total revenue .
1 . 7 .
that' s great .
and what do you project for this year ?
i think we' re gonna have a banner year .
sales are up almost 20 percent in the first quarter , and we just landed a major trucking company account .
you did ?
that' s great .
so that puts you just a tad over two million ?
that' s right .
and that would make us number one in our market .
excuse me .
i' m gonna get a glass of water .
look , i know our paltry little $2 million in sales ... is about what you spend a year on office supplies .
and some regional trucking company account is nothing compared ... to a multi billion dollar merger .
no , no , no .
i' m not trying to knock the tire business .
it' s okay .
i get it .
i' m in your shoes , i' m thinking the same thing , but here' s the deal .
business is business .
wall street , main street .
it' s all a bunch of people getting up in the morning , trying to figure out how they' re going to send their kids to college .
it' s just people , and i know people .
oh , i' m sure you do .
take you , for instance , alan .
you have a certain energy about you , an active kind of energy .
i wouldn' t be surprised if you drank about 16 diet cokes a day .
you' re an excellent father , but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home .
you drink bourbon , but you offer your clients scotch .
and your wife decorated this office .
he certainly seems to have your number .
you' re a little tougher , peter .
for one thing , you like expensive things .
that' s easy .
you' ve seen my car .
you smoke hoyo de monterreys .
you' re a scotch man , single malt , not because it' s trendy but because you' ve been doing it for 40 years ... and you like to stay with what works .
you have two great loves in your life : your horses ... and this company .
and you' re a man who prides himself in finding talent in unusual places .
how would you know that ?
because i' m here .
i' m prepared to do whatever it takes to get this job .
i' il start wherever i have to start .
i' il park cars if i have to .
i can do this job .
i can .
give me a chance , peter .
i won' t let you down .
alan , why don' t you show jack around ?
this is our war room .
we did seven major deals in here last year , three of them ... hostile .
seven ?
yeah .
you get a kind of a feeling from
can we cut the shit here for a minute ?
where did you get that information ?
did you go through his wallet ?
did you surf some net ?
it doesn' t really matter because that circus act you pulled back there ... may have dazzled lassiter , but it doesn' t cut any shit with me .
even if you get this job , which i highly doubt ,
let me just give you a word of warning .
peter lassiter gets tired of his pet projects very , very quickly .
i' ve got that big office because i prove myself to him year after year after year .
nobody is gonna come in here and turn the old man' s head , especially not some tire salesman from new jersey .
so if you' re cautious and you' re quiet , you watch yourself , stay away from lassiter , maybe i' il think about keeping you on here after he gets bored with you .
do we understand each other ?
alan !
god , you really are different .
excuse me ?
i mean , wow !
i' m impressed .
i' m impressed .
good for you .
are we understanding each other ?
yes , alan , i understand you .
okay then .
good .
good .
okay .
okay .
alan !
keep your eyes closed .
hold on .
go ahead .
open your eyes .
welcome to xanadu .
it' s pretty incredible , isn' t it ?
it' s like a museum .
uh huh .
look around .
so what' s the big surprise ?
you didn' t rent this for the weekend , did you ?
think ... bigger .
for the week ?
this place is a perk , kate .
a perk ?
mm hmm .
for what ?
a company called p. k. lassiter investment house ... uses it to attract new executives .
i' m going into arbitrage , honey .
it turns out i have a knack for it .
jack , what are you talking about ?
i' il be making twice what i make now , plus a hefty bonus .
that' s just to start .
and we can live in this apartment ... practically rent free ... until we find a place of our own .
are you out of your mind ?
i don' t think so .
this is gonna be a better life for all of us .
we can put annie and josh into private schools .
annie goes to a great school , jack .
i' m talking about the best schools in the country here .
what could you possibly be thinking about ?
what about my job ?
well , this is new york city .
it' s like the needy people capital of the world .
your jersey clients aren' t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could find here .
i can' t even believe you' re talking about moving back into the city .
i thought the reason we left was because we didn' t want to raise the kids here .
no .
no .
this is the center of the universe .
if i were living in roman times , i would live in rome .
where else ?
today america is the roman empire .
new york is rome itself .
john lennon .
jack !
okay , you know something ?
i' m detecting , like , a funky tension here .
this was supposed to be a happy day , so guess what ?
i don' t need this .
we don' t have to live here .
forget it .
i' il commute .
i' il drive to work .
god !
in traffic , it' s over an hour each way .
that' s three hours every day .
when are you ever going to see the kids ?
kate .
you' re not understanding me .
i' m talking about a perfect life , a great life .
everything we pictured when we were young .
the whole package .
you said so yourself .
life has thrown us a few surprises .
we made sacrifices .
well , guess what ?
now i can finally get us back on track .
i can do that , kate .
i want to do that .
i need to do that as a man !
for all of us .
please just think about this for one second .
no more lousy restaurants .
no more clipping coupons .
no more shoveling snow .
then get a goddamn snowblower , jack !
don' t go get a new career without even telling me about it !
and don' t don' t take annie out of a school she loves .
don' t move us out of a house we' ve become a family in .
you' re you' re
don' t you see ?
i' m talking about us finally having a life ... that other people envy .
oh , jack .
they already do envy us .
from london to new york .
i came back .
when you got on that plane , i was sure it was over .
i left the airport afraid i' d never see you again .
and then you showed up the very next day .
that was a good surprise .
you know , i think about the decision you made .
maybe i was being naive , but i believed ... that we would grow old together in this house , that we' d spend holidays here and ... have our grandchildren come visit us here .
i had this image of us all gray and wrinkly , and me ... working in the garden , and you repainting the deck .
but things change .
if you need this , jack , if you really need this ,
i will take these kids from a life they love , and i' il take myself from the only home we' ve ever shared together ... and i' il move wherever you need to go .
i' il do that because i love you .
i love you , and that' s more important to me than our address .
i choose us .
oh .
i' m gonna chase you .
you can' t catch me .
no , you can' t .
you can' t .
oh !
whoa !
oh .
whoops !
i fell down .
i knew you' d come back .
oh , annie .
i love you .
what are you doing ?
ringing my bell .
4 . 99 ?
it' s just salt , for god sakes .
ninety nine cents , darling .
out often .
you .
jack !
what' s up ?
how you feeling , baby ?
why are you here ?
here' s your change , darling .
five , six , seven , eight , nine , oh one .

look at you , man .
went and got all domestic and everything .
you really figured some things out , huh ?
you' re not sending me back .
everything okay ?
yeah .
hey , did you hear me ?
wait a second .
i' m talking to you .
you see that ?
character .
and for what , for nine bucks ?
that' s just so disappointing .
i' m not going back .
you understand me ?
okay , relax , jack .
you can' t do this .
you can' t keep coming in and out of people' s lives , messing things up .
it' s not right .
a glimpse , by definition , is an impermanent thing , jack .
i' ve got kids .
i' m going home .
is it morning yet ?
no , honey .
go back to sleep .
take care , annie .
i' m going back to the mother ship .
hey .
hey .
these past few weeks , i know i' ve done some some unusual things .
it' s been interesting , that' s for sure .
i' ve done some good things , too , though , haven' t i ?
you' ve been jack campbell , and that' s always a good thing .
i need you to remember me , kate .
how i am right now ... at this very moment .
i need you to put that image in your heart and keep it there .
keep it with you no matter what happens .
are you okay ?
yeah .
yeah .
please just promise me .
you have to promise me , because if you don' t , then it' s like it never happened , and i don' t think i can live with that .
i promise .
promise me again .
i promise .
okay .
now come to bed .
soon .
yeah .
what time is it ?
okay .
yeah .
waiting for me by the door , huh ?
paula .
wow .

it' s not christmas .
it' s whatever you want it to be , jack .
it' s not christmas .

hello .
santa claus , where are you ?
everybody' s here .
adelle ?
you' re a half an hour late .

is this ringing any bells ?
everybody is panicked here , jack .
jack ?
i' il be there in 20 minutes .
no , i' m not gonna go talk to them until i have something to talk to them about .
steve , i don' t care if it' s christmas day .
we' re in a crisis here .
wait a minute .
jack just walked in .
i' il call you back .
jack .
thank god that you' re
you' re here .
are you all right ?
what' s going on here ?
what' s well , it' s not good .
bob thomas has been talking to a european drug company , jack , and we don' t know which one .
they' re gonna let bob buy a minority stake , and let him keep running the entire company .
global knows .
i don' t know how they know , but they know and they' re up in arms .
they think that somehow we should have been prepared for this .
prepared !
oh , god , we' re in trouble .
you know something , alan ?
somewhere inside of you , there' s a much more assertive person .
is this another one of those sun tzu art of war tricks ?
no .
so what are we gonna do , jack ?
jack ?
i' il tell you exactly what we' re going to do .
you' re going to do whatever you have to do to find out ... which european company he' s been talking to .
then i' m going to clean myself up , fly to aspen and drink eggnog with bob thomas .
his wife and kids will be playing in the background in the snow ... while i convince him that the european company ... is the devil ... and global is the answer to his prayers .
then i' m gonna spend four hours skiing ... alone .
completely and utterly alone .
i' m going to do that because that is my life , that' s what' s real ... and there' s nothing i can do to change that .
for manhattan .
kate reynolds .
i need an address too .
it' s very fragile , so i want you to be very careful with it , okay ?
it' s valuable .
it' s over 300 years old .
you' il probably need a few guys to carry it .
all right .
the painting is also very , very old , so take extra care .
it means a lot to kate , okay ?
i appreciate it .
yeah ?
what ?

do you want me to look for the box or call the airline , kate ?
hey , kind of under a little pressure here .
hey , kind of giving up christmas day for my ex boss here .

maybe it' s by the wardrobe boxes .
thank you .
so you' re moving .
yeah , to paris .

i' m gonna be heading it up .

i' m sorry .
i just can' t i' ve gotta go .
i i i' m sorry , jack .
i' m sorry .
excuse me .
can i just i' m sorry .
i was here .
we have a house in jersey !
we have two kids .
annie and josh .
annie' s not much of a violin player , but she tries real hard .
she' s a little precocious , but that' s only because she says what' s on her mind .
and when she smiles
and josh , he has your eyes .
he doesn' t say much , but we know he' s smart .
he' s always got his eyes open .
you know , he' s always watching us .
sometimes you can look at him and you just know ... he' s learning something new .
it' s like witnessing a miracle .
the house is a mess , but it' s ours .
after 122 more payments , it' s going to be ours .
and you , you' re a nonprofit lawyer .
that' s right .
you' re completely nonprofit .
but that doesn' t seem to bother you .
and we' re in love .
after 13 years of marriage , we' re still unbelievably in love .
you won' t even let me touch you till i' ve said it .
i sing to you .
not all the time , but definitely on special occasions .
and we' ve we' ve dealt with our share of surprises and made a lot of sacrifices , but we stayed together .
you see , you' re a better person than i am , and it made me a better person to be around you .
i don' t know .
maybe it was all just a dream .
maybe i went to bed one lonely night in december , and i imagined it all , but ...
i swear , nothing' s ever felt more real .
and if you get on that plane right now , it' il disappear forever .
i know we could both go on with our lives , and we' d both be fine .
but i' ve seen ... what we could be like together .
and i choose us .
please , kate .
one cup of coffee .
you can always go to paris .
just ... please , not tonight .
okay , jack .
okay .
