what the ...
some hunters found the body about an hour ago .
no id .
probably been dead a couple of days .
these wounds are post mortem .
but something was definitely chewing on her ... after she was dumped here .
sam , what do we got here ?
i' d say we got ourselves a homicide .
see that blood ?
it was smeared on .
probably chicken blood .
great .
you don' t think it was one of those voodoo things , do you ?
no , the chicken blood' s there to attract pigs .
a few feral razorbacks could get rid of a corpse in less than a week .
you know what killed her ?
probably blunt force trauma , judging by the cranial bruising .
i' il know more when i get some results , run some tests .
let me grab my kit .
abrams is going to have to handle this one on his own .
i need you to run down to otley .
otley ?
what for ?
they pulled what was left of a body out of the swamp down there .
it' s chewed up real bad , but something ain' t right .
the local sheriff put in a request for a medical examiner .
listen , chief , how about i stay here ?
send abrams down , grab a few photos ...
first of all , you know those swamp rats won' t even talk to outsiders .
now , abrams ain' t even from the south .
yeah , but , chief , i really don' t ...
second of all , you' re the expert at this kind of thing .
abrams ain' t .
all right .
tell them i' il be there by 8 : 00 .
i already did .
thank you .
abrams .
call the state lab .
see if they have any porcine casts or x rays on file .
yeah , sure .
porc ...
porcine .
means pig , einstein .
call me if you have any questions .
otley .
shit .
not a pretty sight , is it ?
looks like he' s been in the water for 48 hours , give or take .
that' s about right .
he was missing for a day and a night .
you know anything about this guy ?
not a lot .
name' s john crankton .
age 57 , 165 pounds .
did you put a verdict down on the cause of death yet ?
alligator attack .
then why call in an me ?
because these don' t look like any gator bites i' ve ever seen before .
they' re not .
alligator teeth are too short and blunt to cause this kind of damage .
i' m going to have to visit the scene .
where' d they find the body ?
way out in the deep swamp .
you got a phone around here ?
sure .
right outside .
you sam rivers ?
that would be me .
you the biologist ?
mary callahan .
department of wildlife and fisheries .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
thank you for coming out here on such short notice .
no problem .
so , you ready ?
yeah , let' s do it .
judging by the map ... we' ve got about a four or five hour ride ahead of us .
i' d say about that .
water ?
no , i' ve got some cold ones in the cooler , if you want .
help yourself .
okay .
thanks .
i didn' t know medical examiners carried guns .
i don' t usually carry one ... but i don' t like going out to a potential crime scene where i can' t call for help .
we' ve got a radio .
where we' re going , nothing works out there .
you seem to know your way around these parts pretty well .
you get a lot of swamp murders ?
no , not really .
when it comes to killing people , the swamp doesn' t need any help .
you want to take a look at some photos of the body ... and tell me what you think ?
yeah , sure .
oh , my god .
is that your professional opinion ?
it' s extremely unlikely that an alligator could have done this .
shark , maybe .
yeah , that was my first thought .
but we' re a little too far upriver for a great white , aren' t we ?
yeah , but not for a bull shark .
they' re extremely aggressive man eaters .
that could be the guy we' re looking for .
hey , stop the boat .
that' s strange .
the noise from the boat should have scared it off .
that gator doesn' t look right .
jesus .
look how ragged the stump is .
it looks like it was torn off .
you think a boat propeller could have done that ?
no boat this big could have traveled that far up the bayou .
well , what do you think happened then ?
probably some redneck poacher' s idea of a joke .
come on .
we' re almost there .
what' s happening ?
is he okay ?
watch .
she' s a beauty .
you got that right .
is it biting you ?
hell , yeah .
some strange fella stick his hand in your hole , wouldn' t you bite him ?
this is like the dark side of hee haw .
we' re looking for where john crankton lived .
what y' all want with old john ?
john' s dead .
yeah , we know he' s dead .
we' re here to find out what happened .
y' all cops ?
my name' s sam rivers .
i' m a medical examiner .
this is mary callahan , department of wildlife and fisheries .
i got me a license .
i really doubt they issue a license to do that .
fisting a catfish ?
well , i don' t know what happened to john .
i wasn' t there .
ricardo brought him back .
he was wrapped up in a tarp or something .
well , we' d like to talk to ricardo , and anyone else who may have known john .
you tow me upstream a mile or two .
i' il introduce you to some folks .
okay .
god , who would want to live so far away from everything ?
hey , pardner , pull up over there .
whose houseboat is that ?
that' s my niece and her naked husband .
it' s one thing to be married to it ... but to have to look at it while you' re eating ...
and who lives in those ?
that house over there on the left , that' s ricardo' s .
and the green one , that' s gloria' s , john' s wife .
roland !
bobbi !
come on down here .
there' s some people who want to meet you .
hi , there .
this man' s sort of a cop .
he wants to talk to you about old john .
lord , it' s awful .
i' ve got to see a man about a bag of squirrels and a mess of fish .
either of you have any ideas of what happened to mr. crankton ?
we feel real sad about what happened to john .
ricardo !
i feel real bad about what' s going to happen to that gator ... because ricardo over there , he' s going to get it ... and it ain' t going to be pretty .
now , ricardo , he' s the one that found the body , right ?
he doesn' t talk much .
and since john died ...
yeah , they were in vietnam together .
we' d like to talk to mrs. crankton , too .
go ahead .
elmer should introduce you ... being that he' s her brother in law and all .
elmer , we' d like to talk to ricardo .
ricardo ain' t talking to nobody .
how about gloria ?
well , come on , we' il see .
hi , elmer .
comment a va , chrie ?
i' m fine , and you ?
i hate to bother you , but is your mama in the house ?
yeah , she' s in there .
you want to come in ?
eliza , your mother will not let me pack up the shrine .
it mustn' t be moved from this spot .
they need its power here .
dan , if she doesn' t want to move the altar , can we just leave it there ?
that' s fine , i just ...
i don' t understand the point of coming here to help your mother move ... if she doesn' t actually want to take anything with her .
there' s some people who want to talk to you about john .
excuse me , ma' am .
sorry to bother you .
i know this is a very difficult time for you and your family .
but we' re here to investigate the death of your husband , john crankton .
we' re hoping to get a look at where john' s body was found .
you' re all they sent ?
just the two of you ?
damn fool .
ma .
sit .
there' s been a curse ... put on this place like none i' ve ever seen .
it come with the storm and the boat , and it' s been with us ever since .
i' ve tried to keep it away .
my circle of protection is small , and i told john ... not to step outside of it .
but he wouldn' t listen .
i don' t know what killed john .
but i do know it' s not from this swamp .
apparently , after hurricane garrick ... they found a strange boat a few miles upstream .
mama said that' s when all the crazy stuff started to happen .
like the fish getting scarce .
i' ve never seen it myself .
this boat , can you show it to us ?
no , i can' t go there .
my circle is what' s keeping that thing away .
elmer can take you .
i' m fishing ...
elmer , i warned you .
i know what you think .
she' s a crazy old witch .
i never said ...
i' m getting out of here .
and once i' m gone , there won' t be nothing to keep that evil thing away .
well , thank you for your time .
you stop it .
you stop it now , before anyone else dies .
take these with you .
thanks .
bye , chrie .
what is this thing ?
it' s just some crazy old voodoo stuff .
just put it in your pocket .
hi .
hi .
y' all want some fruit ?
no , thanks .
guess not , huh ?
got no shame , them two .
this place used to have some decency .
come on , have a banana .
here , baby .
no , i don' t want a banana .
what' s a boat that size doing way up in the swamp ?
i have no idea .
now , i just offered to show y' all the boat .
i never said nothing about getting on it .
you' ve been on it before ?
no .
how long has this thing been here ?
about three months .
and you' ve never been aboard once ?
not even to look for something worth taking ?
no .
did john crankton go aboard ?
never said he did .
never said he didn' t .
hey , pardner .
don' t stay too long .
i don' t plan to be out here all day .
yeah , we' il try not to keep you away from your busy routine .
i wonder why no one has come looking for this thing .
this boat had a chinese crew .
nothing' s working here .
let' s check out the hold .
what is that smell ?
something' s rotten .
oh , god .
fuck .
you be careful .
oh , man .
you all right ?
yeah .
i' m okay .
jesus .
damn .
what ?
nothing .
you okay ?
yeah .
i' m not usually this squeamish , but that smell was just ...
what is this ?
my god , look at this .
what is this ?
it' s a fish scale .
only i' ve never seen one that big before .
not even close .
neither have i.
i want to get out of here .
let' s get out of here .
we' re coming .
slow down .
take your time .
watch your head .
steady , miss .
elmer , you okay ?
yeah .
i' m sorry , elmer .
it' s all right , missy .
everything' s going to be fine .
come on , elmer .
what the fuck ?
what was that ?
i don' t know .
but we' re getting the hell out of here .
untie the boat .
come on in .
you guys have been looking in the wrong fucking place .
idiots .
this better be good .
it' s anton .
i' m sorry , buttercup .
i' ve got to take this .
anton .
your merchandise has been located .
fantastic .
where is it ?
it' s about 50 miles downriver .
so , what happened ?
we have no idea .
well , what about the cargo ?
don' t know .
you' re starting to piss me off again , anton .
all right , i' il have my boys get the boat ready .
jeff , come on .
none of your great white hunter bullshit , okay ?
let me get someone in there to check it out and take care of things .
after three months , the chances of that cargo ...
yeah , you' re goddamn straight after three months .
you and your boys fucked it up last time .
so , i' m going to go down there this time and make sure it doesn' t happen again .
even if the cargo survived whatever happened to the boat ... there' s gators and other shit down there ...
there' s nothing in that swamp that can touch them .
you got that ?
yeah .
so , stop bitching and get your skinny ass down to my dock .
fuck .
i' m coming for you , you beautiful motherfuckers .
so , you' re saying there' s a swamp monster out here killing people ?
look , the only thing that' s out there are things that belong there .
look , are we safe here ?
that boat is about three miles away from here .
since there hasn' t been any attacks down here ... it was probably just territorial .
yeah , if we don' t bother it , it won' t bother us .
bother us ?
it killed my dad .
it just killed her uncle .
listen .
it' s too late to make it back before dark , and it' s too dangerous to go at night .
but at first light ...
mary and i will head back and get some help to take care of this .
well .
what' s done is done .
mama .
you know ... this is ridiculous .
anton .
glad you could make it .
my pilot wants to know where we' re going .
i' ve got it mapped out .
who' s our friend here , jeff ?
and what' s with all the equipment ?
anton , meet ben .
how are you ?
we' ve already been on a couple of hunts together .
yes , i' ve killed and tracked just about any goddamn thing you can think of .
this ain' t a fucking game , jeff .
you' re goddamn straight about that .
it' s a hunt .
now , come on , man .
what are we dealing with ?
well , it' s clearly carnivorous ... which right there , narrows it down to about four or five fish on the planet .
yeah , but look at the size of this scale .
how the hell did it get so big ?
it' s the bayou .
swamp' s a wild place .
unless you accept that , you ain' t getting out of here alive .
the thing that killed john thinks it' s king out here .
but it ain' t .
i' il kill it .
i swear to god , i will .
dinner' s ready .
and y' all got to eat .
i made gumbo .
that includes you , ricardo .
isn' t he afraid of whatever is out there ?
ricardo ain' t scared of anything .
there' s worse things than dying .
we ask you to protect us from the evil that lurks here .
and we ask that you take elmer upon your wings ... and you carry him home .
amen .
here you go .
thank you .
thank you .
sam ?
no thanks .
this is excellent , gloria .
thank you .
you' re welcome , young man .
it' s nice to make a big meal every now and then .
snapping turtle ?
why , yes .
excuse me .
it' s been a long time .
where did you say you were from again ?
well , actually i grew up around here , in otley .
you didn' t happen to go to bienvenu high , did you ?
yeah , i did .
i moved to new orleans middle of my senior year , but i was class of ' 91 .
this is crazy .
i' m eliza desir .
i used to pour gatorade at all the football games .
right .
of course , i remember .
you sure must have loved football .
you never missed a practice .
is this the boy you told me about ?
no , mother .
because i remember , his name was sam something ... and he left town .
she had a crush ... on this one boy in high school .
she asked me to put magic on him once .
really ?
oh , yeah .
of course , you can' t do something like that for a girl that age .
not that it would have turned out any worse , mind you .
okay , you know , that' s really nice .
that comment' s about me , isn' t it ?
that' s just lovely .
would you guys excuse us for a minute , please ?
excuse me .
dan , you' re being rude .
you' re a guest in my mama' s house ...
look , i' m sorry , okay ?
i didn' t expect to spend my day off ... bobbing around on a raft in the middle of the swamp .
i told you where i was from .
eliza , i thought your mother lived in a cabin off some river .
this gumbo is really good , gloria .
thank you .
it was not !
would you like some tea ?
dan , i didn' t ask for your help .
you offered it .
no , i offered because you implied ... that my assistance was essential for our dating relationship to progress .
and you knew i had a motorboat , sweetheart .
the request was therefore implicit .
it was not .
i should have never hooked up with a lawyer .
should have never dated a swamp girl .
more turtle soup .
you know , i could use another beer .
thank you .
that' s just great .
thanks .
i' m a paralegal in his office .
why do you put up with him ?
because i' m a paralegal in his office .
well , you deserve someone who' s never like that .
someone who will massage your feet after a long day ... cook you a nice dinner , read your poetry .
someone who actually values you ... instead of some jerk who comes home expecting a blowjob .
yeah , where am i supposed to find a guy like that ?
who says i' m talking about a guy ?
but , you know , it' s funny .
man or woman ... you still end up spending the same amount of time ... with your head stuck between someone' s legs .
sam , what you drinking ?
just some tea your mother made me .
it' s delicious .
what kind of tea , ma ?
just an old family recipe .
mind your business , girl .
just keep on bickering with your white devil there .
excuse me .
i really appreciate that , you know .
that' s the kind of attitude that got me ...
what kind of tea , ma ?
what the hell ?
honey , i think i see something .
i' m just gonna go ...
hey , bobbi , get out here .
i just saw something .
roland , what is it ?
i don' t know .
i just saw it .
oh , my god !
bobbi , what happened ?
he was near the water ...
his fucking head is missing .
bobbi , what happened ?
something came out of the water !
sam .
oh , shit .
it' s here .
it followed us back .
no , bobbi , stay away from the edge !
we' il come get you !
i can' t stay here !
just take it easy .
don' t let it take me !
please , don' t let it take me !
help !
help me !
don' t move , bobbi .
stay in the boat .
oh , god .
hurry !
swim !
come on !
come on !
shit !
hurry up !
come on , bobbi !
come on !
did you see that fucking thing ?
now we know what could decapitate a 12 foot alligator .
this is all my fault .
it' s not your fault .
i knew ...
if it' s anybody' s fault , it' s ours .
it must have followed us from the wreck .
it' s nobody' s fault .
it' s an animal .
it' s doing what animals do .
it' s no more evil than any other predator .
she' s right .
we' ve got to get off the water .
start your boat .
it' s the biggest and the fastest , we may outrun it .
fuck you .
i' m not getting in that thing .
did you see what it just did to bobbi ?
give me the keys .
okay .
fine .
mary .
eliza .
get ready to cast off .
as soon as i start the engine , everybody pile in .
what about ricardo ?
he won' t go .
shit , man !
my fucking boat !
it' s attacking everything that moves .
everybody be quiet .
we don' t have a choice .
all right .
we' re gonna have to kill it .
it' s the only way we' re going to get out of here .
gloria , do you have any sort of weapon ?
did john have a gun ?
no , it' s gone .
man , we are fucking fish food .
shut up .
bobbi and roland' s houseboat , that' s factory made .
does it still run ?
i don' t know .
i think so .
sam , you' re out of your mind .
that will never hold you .
i don' t see any other options .
i' m the smallest one , and i' m not getting in that .
i can do it .
i' ve done it before .
when you was 12 or 13 .
you sure you want to do this ?
yeah .
hold on !
eliza , hurry .
eliza , are you all right ?
yeah .
i' m fine .
come on , you fucker .
roland , you stoner asshole !
how many times have we shot it ?
it should be dead by now .
really ?
well , it' s not .
that was it for ammo .
looks like roland was working on the engine ... but he was too stoned to finish it .
ricardo , get away from the edge .
get away from it , ricardo !
shoot it !
jesus christ .
ricardo ?
you killed that thing .
that is not a shark .
no , i' ve never seen anything like it .
that' s good .
oh , god .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
that thing ate bobbi .
that' s just wrong .
what smells delicious ?
oh , fuck .
so , i guess we' re having fillet of swamp monster ?
it killed my brother !
you thought you were king of the swamp ... until i ripped out your heart , motherfucker !
he' s talking to the dead fish .
john , this is for you !
look out !
oh , god !
there' s another one ?
who knows how many there are ?
it can breathe out of the water ?
how the fuck can it do that ?
it must have a vestigial air lung .
like chinese snakeheads .
they can live out of water for days .
they' re voracious .
they took over a lake in maryland a couple of years ago ... and the wildlife and fisheries people had to poison the lake .
they were scared ...
it' s a monster !
it' s not a fish !
fuck .
what' s going on ?
you got it ?
yeah .
don' t see anything .
let' s get on it .
fucking amateurs .
nothing ?
what we want ain' t here .
what about our mules ?
they' re here , all right .
bits and pieces of them , anyway .
then we' re fucked .
son , if your prey were that easy to find , it wouldn' t be hunting .
it' d be shopping .
what do we do now ?
my god !
are you okay , eliza ?
what the hell are we going to do ?
wait .
i know how we can get out of here .
all we have to do is get over to ricardo' s ...
oh , shit !
the house shot her .
this is insane !
shut up !
may you find your wings ... to carry you home .
what just happened ?
what do i do ?
what the hell was that ?
let' s go , boys .
my god !
is she alive ?
sam !
hurry !
come this way .
get the ladder , boy !
get up on the roof !
come on , gloria !
oh , god !
we need to get up on the roof .
i need you to help me .
let' s go .
oh , shit !
okay , this is not good .
it' s attacking the boat !
i think it' s sinking the houseboat .
no .
this is not happening .
oh , god !
excuse me .
but i' m fucking sinking over here !
jesus , we got to get off the fucking water .
really ?
fuck me .
now it' s sinking it .
wait !
no !
it' s really sinking .
just hold on , eliza .
hey , can you hold yourself ?
i just want to see if i can look inside ricardo' s .
he' s got to have something in there .
no , what are you talking about ?
it' il be okay .
just look out for me .
just look out for me .
sam , don' t .
no , i' il be okay .
it' s gonna kill you , sam .
trust me .
we' re fucking fish food , man !
here , i found a flare gun .
what' s that noise ?
it' s a boat !
hello !
hey !
what ?
be careful !
you guys got to watch out !
what happened here ?
there' s something in the water !
fuck !
hurry up !
come on !
come on , man , swim !
what the hell was that ?
you' ve got to swim .
no !
i tried to warn you .
get out !
hey , never get out of the boat .
now tell me exactly what happened here .
it destroyed my motorboat , and then it sank these houseboats .
then it killed everybody .
tell me , how many are there ?
we don' t know .
we killed one , but there' s at least one more .
what are those things ?
they' re genetically engineered northern snakeheads .
in china , they' re a delicacy .
there' s a whole piece here ...
dan , shut up !
you talk to him .
you' ve been eating genetically engineered salmon for years ... and most people don' t even know it .
some of our friends just took it one step further .
this is the result .
explain to me , why would you do that ?
well , son ...
i' m not your son .
there' s no thrill to compare with hunting something that can hunt you back .
when i heard of the possibility of creating something that' s never been seen before ... and something that' s never been hunted before ... that' s a once in a lifetime opportunity , and i took it .
that' s fucking crazy .
there she blows !
hit it ?
yeah , i got it .
it' s gonna be okay now .
look , we' ve waited long enough .
the tranq should' ve taken effect by now .
you pumped it with enough of that to drop a rhino .
two rhinos .
dude , then let' s go .
ten more minutes , and we' il be in the water anyway .
no .
you' re crazy , man .
that thing will take your fucking head off .
so , we all hit the water at the same time , swim for the fan boat .
even if it isn' t knocked out , it can' t get all of us .
no .
let' s do it .
oh , shit !
where' s anton !
shit !
nice shooting , thank you .
get out .
there may be more .
there ain' t no more of them here .
don' t worry about it , honey .
get aboard .
time to finish her off , before we lose her .
you guys can' t leave us out here like that .
it' s wounded , we can track it now .
we need to go back to town , bring back enough firepower to kill that thing .
we' ve got all the gear we need .
y' all can stand there , or you can come with us .
excuse me ?
i want to go home .
all right .
but once y' all get aboard my boat ... you do what i say , you understand ?
let' s go .
come to daddy .
yeah .
we' re home !
there' s some more blood !
you don' t waste any time , do you ?
shut up , dan .
i' m warning you .
she doesn' t put out nearly as quickly as you think .
shut up , dan .
more blood .
look .
what is that ?
now what ?
now we go get it .
forget it .
this is your safari , you go drag it out .
you know what ?
i' m going to have my hands full holding this gun .
and seeing that i don' t feel like hauling his sorry drunk ass in there with me ... it' s either going to be you or her .
i' il go .
excellent .
ben , time to cowboy up , my friend .
the guy' s a dick .
you first .
be careful , sam .
hey , you .
go on , get in there .
get in there .
how many ?
god damn it , ben .
did you see how big that female was ?
the male could be 25 feet long .
what' s he talking about ?
nothing , keep going .
move it .
move on .
go on , get in there .
wait , what are you doing ?
there it is .
that flare must' ve killed it .
it looks dead .
come on .
you get over there and cover me , man .
you don' t know that that thing could put it out .
i tripled the dose .
it' s enough for a whale .
now , come on .
you don' t know that .
are you saying there' s another one ?
i' m trying to start this engine so we can go get sam ... and leave those two assholes to their monster .
you never told me you could do that .
i bought three .
two of them are dead .
and i' m bringing the last one home with me , alive .
get over there , ben .
don' t tell me what to do !
you two are pretty damn stupid .
just do as i say , everything will be fine .
come on .
ben !
forget this .
you stay exactly where you are .
we' ve seen what your swamp monster does to people .
so , if you want to shoot me , shoot me .
eliza !
we' ve got to get out of here !
help !
christ , let' s go !
go , man !
go !
dan !
sam !
hand me the oar !
all right , take the stick and head for those trees !
and get ready to jump !
what do you mean , jump ?
just do it !
eat this , you freak !
jump !
that was a good idea .
thanks .
you know , you look great for a girl covered in giant fish brains .
yeah ?
yeah .
