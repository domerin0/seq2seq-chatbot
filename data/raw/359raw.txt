my name' s jamie .
i' m adam .
why don' t you show adam his new room ?
come on .
okay .
you shot your mouth off like a kid
who' s scared to have a heart
losing grip of what really matters
' cause you don' t know where to start
you wake up in the morning
with a starfuck for a friend
the things you do are so in tune
with what you said you hate
what' s giving you the will to live
is looking for revenge
the only laugh that you got left
is hiding from the pain
what must have happened to your soul
is skinning you alive
the thing you fear the most is love
and that' s very deep inside
yeah
so deep inside
don' t lose your head
' cause i can' t do the time
don' t lose your head
or can you pay the price
the heart you' re building out of rock
is turning into sand
' cause you never took the time to think
what it means to be a man
you act like you got the answer
when the question' s never asked
i' ve been to where you' re coming from
but the postcards weren' t so bad
the knife i carry has been sharpened
on the mouths that won' t keep shut
i' d stab at you in the darkness
to try to shed some light
your point of view' s so meaningless
if you ever had one at all
well , all you seem to care about
is who' s gonna take the fall
who' s gonna take the fall for you
don' t lose your head
now i can' t do the time for you
don' t lose your head
now can you pay the price
yeah
are you unworthy
don' t lose your head
' cause i can' t do the time oh , yeah
don' t lose your head
well , can you pay the price
don' t lose your head
' cause i can' t do the time oh , yeah
don' t lose your head all right
well , can you pay the price
don' t lose your head
if you can' t do the time
no , don' t lose your head
if you can' t pay the price
don' t lose your head if you can' t pay the price
don' t lose your head
you know i can' t do the time
yeah you ain' t worth it to me
don' t lose your head you ain' t worth it to me
