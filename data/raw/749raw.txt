repossessed .
we' re all so proud .
maybe i should stay home tonight .

i' m not that old .
i went to abbott high school , too .

i hear patroltec has an opening .
so ... exactly what did you girls do last night ?
exactly ?
exactly .
here' s the thing , mom .
the thing is ...
we left the house , but i assure you , it was for a very important adolescent cause .
adolescent ?
as in " growing up " ?
is that so hard to believe ?
yes , it is , because not too long ago i had a little girl who took ballet .
she did magic tricks .
we used to bake together in her easy bake oven , and she loved ponies and ladybugs .
i remember her .
i guess i missed the bridge between ladybugs and boys .
i think i' m still standing on that bridge .
you take your time crossing it .
got you something .
a doorknob ?
with a lock .
to the unstoppable freshmer .
unstoppable !
that' s my mom .
she' s giving me a ride .
i have to get home and finish packing .
bye !
bye !
bye !
i had a fun time !
thank you !
so ... this is it .
you' re really moving .
everything changes now .
everything would have changed anyway .
last night did that .
tell me how the view is from the lunch spot .
if we sit there .
what do you mean ?
wherever we sit , that' il be the lunch spot .
you' re ready for high school .
i blame you .
take care of the girls .
don' t forget .
never .
i think this is yours .
ard so it happened ... the girl ir the lopsided crowr got her kiss .
naturally .
h told harrah all about it .
h try to keep her up to date with high school .
which is going surprisinly well ... for us .
