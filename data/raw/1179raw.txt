ha , ha , ha .
home sweet home .
thanks , cochise .
no , you fucking idiot !
i' ve worked at a restaurant my whole life .
shit !
it gonna be that kind of a party ,
i' m gonna stick my dick in the mashed potatoes !
guess who .
hi , dean .
it' s mom .
ah , shit .
i know you' re not gonna forget lunch with me , but i thought i' d call just to make sure .
oh , hey .
i forgot you were here .
yeah , i know .
i know .
what ?
nothing .
i' il see you at work , okay ?
hey , there , natasha .
how' s my favorite minor doing today ?
hung over .
i got so shitty last night .
on a school night ?
kids today .
i must say , there' s nothing more attractive than tainted youth .
yes .
i am indeed a pervert .
does that offend you ?
nope .
i think that most tainted youths end up being perverts .
good answer .
oh , and monty , just so you know ,
i' m only a minor for another week .
i turn 18 on wednesday .
well , then i guess i better hurry up then .
i don' t have much time .
hey , dan .
hey , monty .
how you doing ?
good .
this is mitch .
it' s his first day .
i want you to show him around .
train him on everything while it' s slow , and when the dinner rush hits , we' il have him watch the training videos .
mitch , just listen to what monty says today , and we' il have you out on the floor by early next week .
sound good ?
yeah .
all right then .
give him a quick tour before your shift starts .
good stuff .
well , mitch , first thing .
you ever worked in a restaurant before ?
actually , yeah ...
well , it doesn' t really matter anyway .
working in a restaurant' s all about learning a routine .
everything that dan wants me to show you , teach you , all that can be learned in a few hours .
but ... if you wanna work here , in this restaurant ,
i really think that you need to ask yourself one simple question .
how do you feel about frontal male nudity ?
what the heck ...
pretty fucked up , huh ?
you see , the reason that i ask is most of the guys that work here
like to play this little game that involves flashing their genitalia to each other .
are you serious ?
yes , i' m serious .
now , the exact object of the game is to get the other participants to unknowingly look at your testicles and l or penis .
and if they do , you ridicule them mercilessly for being a fag and get to kick them in the ass .
but that' s ...
i know .
i know .
it' s demented , depraved , senseless .
all true .
now there are rules to the game ... different variations on how to show your dick and l or balls which allow for more kicks .
but we' re gonna get into that later .
right now , the first thing that you have to do is look deep inside yourself and figure out if you can take an eyeful of that .
so are you taking any interesting classes this semester ?
well , yeah .
i' m only taking the two classes , but i like ' em both .
i really like my teachers .
cool guys .
both have mustaches , which is a little weird .
well , that' s just terrific .
yeah .
guess who i ran into yesterday ?
who' s that ?
nancy miller and her son chet .
you remember chet miller , don' t you ?
oh , yeah .
i remember chet .
yeah .
i haven' t seen that guy since high school .
well , he was away at college .
right .
didn' t you two have all the same honors classes together ?
yeah , we sure did .
yeah , it sounds like he' s doing really well .
i' il bet .
seems he just graduated with a bachelor' s degree in electrical engineering .
wow .
his parents must really be proud , huh ?
well , i' m gonna go .
always love these get togethers .
i think we really broke through there .
let me tell you something .
my trainer , that bastard , he didn' t prewarn me at all .
he set me up big time .
right around that corner .
okay .
look at the log , bitch .
there are few things in this world more unsettling than going into the back to grab condiments , and ending up staring at a huge , steaming pile of cock .
hey , serena .
hey , babe .
what' s up , hangover ?
i' m not hung over .
oh , you and monty were crazy last night .
yeah , it was cool .
how about you ?
you have a good time ?
i would' ve had a better time if somebody hadn' t been ignoring me all night .
was that me ?
think monty and i got a little carried away .
oh , i swear , when you two are together .
you' re perverts !
all of you .
if you guys can go five minutes without referencing your genitals , i' il be amazed .
i know what you' re thinking now .
you think we' re all gay , don' t you ?
think we' re all just a bunch of deviant lifestyle living , same sex having motherfuckers , am i right ?
yeah .
well , listen .
you can put that faggoty baby to bed right now .
none of the guys that work here are gay .
i mean , i' il stick my finger in my ass every now and again when i' m feeling squirrelly , but that' s about the extent of it .
it' s absolutely true .
i' ve seen him do it .
see what i mean ?
perverts .
hey , i' ve seen you use more than a finger .
oh !
bye , babe .
what' s up , buddy ?
nothin ' , man .
what' s going on ?
what ?
what ?
what' s wrong ?
i' il tell you later .
listen , man .
you got nothing to worry about .
it' s just a game .
exactly .
and besides , you know , if heterosexual men can' t show their cocks to each other ,
then what the hell are we doing here ?
amen , brother .
you' re adorable .
hey , bishop .
this is mitch .
he' s the new guy .
i want you to do a couple things for me .
first , i want you to observe very closely your surroundings today .
take everything in .
leave no mental stone unturned .
can you do that for me , mitch ?
good .
then i want you think about what your life would be like if you had been born blind .
thanks , bishop .
go .
go , go , go , go , go .
as you can see , this is a wait station .
this is where you' re gonna get the ice , the soft drinks , the condiments , the doggie bags , et cetera and so forth .
that' s the computer where you' re gonna put the food and drink orders in .
i hate this fucking place sometimes , you know .
why the fuck do we need four more people on at this time of day , man ?
look at this place !
it' s fucking dead .
i swear , dan needs to clean the shit out of his fucking brain sometimes , man .
fucking asshole .
what are you looking at , fuckwad ?
that' s naomi .
and she' s been working here way too long .
but she' s actually a pretty sweet girl when she' s drunk .
let' s go .
come on , baby .
it' s nothin ' like that .
it' s true .
you just treat me like a piece of meat .
not just any piece of meat , baby .
a prime rib .
really ?
uh huh .
baby , you' re oozin ' with sexuality .
yeah , but why does it always have to be about my looks ?
just ' cause i dress slutty doesn' t mean i am slutty .
okay .
this is for deliveries .
there' s the dumpster for the trash .
also , if you wanna get out of the restaurant and chill out , here you go .
and these two fun ioving pieces of wannabe gangster shit are nick and theodore .
how many fucking times i told you , man ?
it' s the fucking t dog , yo .
sorry , g.
hey , yo , bitch .
what makes you think i won' t cut you ?
aw .
come on , now , dog .
you know i' m just fucking with you .
you know i give you the mad , phat , superfly , stupid dope , dumb ass , retarded , bomb shit props .
yo , it' s almost 4 : 20 , dog .
let' s go .
those guys should be sterilized .
and i' m not kidding at all .
you don' t talk much , do you , mitch ?
actually , you haven' t really given ...
that' s okay .
' cause i didn' t talk much when i first started working here either .
you just gotta get used to your surroundings .
what' s up , poncho ?
hey , raddimus .
how you doin ' ?
actually , more importantly , how are you and danielle doing ?
i saw that you guys were arguing , and ...
shit , you know , it would be a shame if you guys broke up .
you two are really good together .
fuck off , okay .
even if we did break up , you stand no chance in hell , man .
she got this thing about dating grown men who' ve had sex with 16 year old girls .
see , that' s the problem with women , okay ?
they' re always trying to project their own values on you .
whatever .
anyway , this is mitch .
he just started today , so i thought i' d give you the pleasure of explaining the finer points of the game to him .
oh , virgin blood .
follow me .
come here .
i wanna talk to you .
thanks , raddimus .
be gentle .
there you go , dean .
aw , thanks , tyla .
you rock .
yeah , tyla , you' re the coolest girl in the whole school .
hey , man .
tyla , every time i look at you , i wish i was a lesbian .
oh , what a coincidence .
every time i look at you ,
i' m glad i' m a lesbian .
ouch .
oh , hey , christy .
it' s just calvin callin ' .
just starting to work the double .
you owe me .
no , i was kiddin ' .
you don' t really owe me anything .
so , i was just callin ' ya , ' cause it' s kind of dead here right now .
so , i don' t know .
give me a call back .
i' m at work .
duh .
duh .
come on .
talk to me , goose .
what' s wrong ?
remember chet miller from high school ?
tall guy , kind of smelled like my dad' s ass ?
that' s the one .
my mother told me he graduated with his bachelor' s degree in electrical engineering .
yeah , so ?
well , you know , we were in all the same classes in high school .
we' re the same fucking age .
well , yeah .
but electrical engineering ?
come on .
screw that noise .
yeah , but come on , man .
we haven' t even graduated from community college .
haven' t even got our a. a. degree .
then when we do , what ?
what the hell can you do with an a. a. degree anyway ?
you can get a job substitute teaching for retarded kids or something .
exactly .
that' s the dish area back there .
this is where you pick up the food .
that' s floyd .
floyd !
welcome to thunderdome , bitch .
okay , that' s the dry area , man .
that' s where we keep all the condiments .
right over here .
this is the cooler .
the milk and vegetables , whatever .
back here is the freezer .
you' il find the meat ...
okay , so let me tell you about this little game we play .
i assume monty went over the basic idea with you , right ?
yeah , he ...
you know the object , right ?
to have the other guy look at you naked .
are you okay with that ?
what are you , some kind of a fucking sick , demented pervert , huh ?
no .
i was ...
he told me .
come on , bro .
i' m just fucking with you .
look , man , we' re all sick .
all right ?
now , look .
the main thing to remember is to get the other guy to unknowingly look at your cock and balls .
okay , don' t just fucking pull down your pants and say , " look at my dick !
you gotta be sneaky .
i' m gonna go through the positions with you .
the first one' s the easiest .
call that one " the look .
all right ?
all you gotta do , pull down your pants real quick , show ' em the goods .
if they look , you get to kick ' em in the ass once .
second one is called " the brain . " right ?
what you gotta do is isolate your nuts with your fist .
okay , now , take the time to look at it , okay ?
because it bears a striking resemblance to ...
aha .
brain .
yeah .
okay .
for that you get two kicks .
so ...
the third one , i call it the " bat wing .
okay .
what you do is you take the excess skin from your nuts , and you take it and you make it flat like paper , all right ?
now , once again , you take the time to appreciate this .
you see that it looks all veiny and alive like a bat wing , all right ?
if they look , they get three kicks , all right ?
but you can' t forget this , all right ?
you gotta call ' em a fag , okay ?
very important .
the game loses it' s meaning if you don' t humiliate them for being a fucking meatcake .
you got that ?
i just don' t understand why your mom gives you so much shit anyway .
i don' t know , man .
you know .
she' s my mom .
she wants me to succeed in life .
yeah .
whatever the hell that means .
jesus , i' m just glad my mom' s not like that .
so i called your house today at 2 : 00 .
you were still asleep , weren' t you ?
that' s an understatement .
so what did you do last night ?
i trust my little angel didn' t do anything immoral .
well , let' s see .
i started by getting completely hammered drunk .
it was bad .
then drove while intoxicated to pick up this disease infested prostitute .
uh huh .
from there , let' s see .
me and the hooker went back to my place ...
the hooker and i.
excuse me .
the hooker and i went back to my place .
and from there ...
god , it was just a blur of intravenous drug abuse and unprotected sex while taking the lord' s name in vain .
dean , did you know that when monty was a child , everyone thought he was retarded ?
dean , doesn' t my mom look old ?
i mean , like , much older than she rightfully should ?
so why aren' t you and serena still together ?
i liked her .
i don' t know .
i guess it got old .
we had a relationship based on orgasms .
oh , how charming .
you are being safe , aren' t you ?
i don' t think i could handle the idea of you reproducing .
come on , mom .
of course i' m being safe .
i pull out .
yes , well , your father pulled out too , but we' ve all seen the tragic end of that story .
you think i wanna have kids ?
absolutely not .
that' s why i stick to anal sex .
if only i had been so lucky .
okay , so that' s the abraham lincoln .
but remember , you have to shave it so it looks like his beard .
otherwise , it don' t count .
now the last one .
the last one is called " the goat .
okay , it' s a bit trickier .
but if you can pull it off , you are a god among men , all right ?
what you do is you take your nuts and your dick , right ?
and you tuck it underneath .
pull your pants down , show it , all right ?
with it sticking out the backside .
you got that ?
okay , well , that just about covers all the different variations that we have .
but you know , we' re always looking for new positions .
so next time you got a little down time , you find yourself a little bored , play with your nuts , you know what i' m saying ?
see what you come up with , okay ?
it' s all good .
all right .
i really only have one thing i wanna talk about today , and that' s teamwork .
when the dinner rush hits and things start to get hectic , you all have a tendency to start yelling and screaming at one another .
that' s just dumb and senseless , ' cause you' re only gonna be hurting yourselves .
let' s think about it .
if you upset the hostess , she' s not gonna seat you .
if you upset the busboys , they' re not gonna care if your table' s ready .
if you upset the cooks , they' re not gonna care if your food' s taking too long .
the brain !
ah , shit !
oh , the brain !
i think you' re all great waiters and waitresses .
and you should be able to rely on one another when you' re in the weeds .
remember , gang .
the difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra .
all right .
that' s all i have for you today .
let' s have a great shift .
oh , uh , push the fish .
it' s about to turn .
that' s it .
dean , can i have a word with you ?
sure .
have a seat , dean .
thanks , dan .
how long you been a waiter ?
since i was 18 , so about four years .
wow .
you don' t wanna be a waiter forever , do you ?
what do you mean ?
carson got promoted to gm over at riverside , so we need a new assistant manager .
i' d like to offer the job to you .
are you serious ?
heck , yeah , i' m serious .
now i' m not gonna lie to you .
the job comes with more responsibility , but it offers a lot more rewards .
you get full medical , dental , two weeks ' paid vacation , and i might add , a hefty pay increase .
i do pretty well .
cool .
it is cool .
and , let' s not forget the power .
right .
control .
you tell people to do things , and they have to do it , or they get in trouble .
i mean , you' re in the driver' s seat here .
your finger' s on the button .
think about it .
okay .
well .
are you okay ?
if you' re not interested ...
no , no , no .
it' s not that i' m not interested , i just ...
sorry , dan , just a lot of things ...
can i take a little while to think about it ?
yeah .
oh , sure .
yeah , yeah .
take your time .
yeah , don' t rush , you know .
talk about it next week or something like that .
cool .
thanks , dan .
let me ask you something .
what' s that ?
why don' t we hang out ?
oh .
like ...
why don' t we hang out more often ?
we do at work .
you and me .
i was thinking to myself last night , laying in bed , going ,
why don' t dean and i hang out ?
we' re practically the same guy .
l l i sort of have a core group of friends .
you have your own friends and ...
you know what ?
you' d think i do .
i don' t .
has anyone seen dean ?
oh , he' s in the back talking to dan .
yeah , you wanna know what they' re talking about ?
dan wants to make dean assistant fuckin ' manager .
well , did he take the job ?
i don' t know .
i couldn' t ...
he better fuckin ' not have .
okay , whoa , whoa .
hold on .
i gotta warn you .
take my car , what do you think' s gonna happen ?
yeah , i don' t really think ...
score .
okay .
god .
hey , so what was that about ?
nothing important .
just bullshit .
what ?
hey , there , folks .
my name' s dean .
i' il be your waiter today .
can get you something to drink while you' re looking at the menus ?
hi , there , guys .
my name is serena , and i' il be taking care of you today .
hey , there , ladies .
hi , my name is amy , and i' il be your waitress today .
is there anything i can get you to drink while you' re looking at the menus ?
yeah , i want a single shot of whiskey and a double shot of whiskey , and she' il have a water .
you know , what the hell ?
it' s our anniversary .
why don' t you bring her a pepsi ?
you' il be taking care of us ?
i like the sound of that .
i like that .
okay , i don' t mean to be a bitch , but the last four times we' ve come here , the food was awful .
well , i apologize for the food the last few times , and we will certainly do our best to make sure that doesn' t happen again .
yeah , that' s what the last waitress said .
can i get an extra side of blue cheese ?
sir , yes , sir .
right .
blue cheese for you , stat .
have a good day , big guy .
thanks .
assistant manager jackoff .
come on , you worthless dick .
just pee .
fuck .
i' il try the other hand maybe .
goddamn it .
i can' t believe you would do that to me .
no , that' s it .
do not ...
do not call me back .
hey .
are you okay ?
i' m about this close to swearing off men altogether .
let me get you another drink .
all right , see what serena' s doing right there ?
she' s baiting those poor saps .
i love patrick swayze .
yeah ?
yeah , you kind of remind me of him .
i guarantee you they' re gonna leave her a fat tip .
women , they' re so fuckin ' wily .
oh , but poor , amy .
she' s a different story .
she was d. o. a. from the very beginning .
and by extra lemon we mean enough for our waters and then some more .
look at the scowl on that woman' s face .
it' s all my fault .
that would be lovely .
thank you .
thank you so much .
don' t worry .
you are too kind .
she' il be lucky to get ten percent .
i' m surprised you didn' t give those guys a lap dance .
oh , what' s that , jealousy ?
women troubles , amy ?
i just don' t understand what would compel a person to be such a bitch to a total stranger .
maybe she was abused as a child .
oh , god .
i fucking hope so .
oh , man .
you look really pissed .
you really are an asshole .
shenaniganz .
fuck you .
he has a shy bladder .
so is there ...
mitch , go in the back , check out the cooks .
i' il be there in a few minutes , okay ?
so , what do you think of natasha ?
i think she' s illegal .
yeah .
i' ve made peace with that .
seriously , look at her .
you know she has that scooby doo tongue .
statutory rape .
on the other hand , maybe she is too young .
like that' s ever stopped you before .
that is a very , very good point .
and i' m convinced natasha will be mine .
thanks for the advice , buddy .
hey , anytime .
yeah .
what' s going on with you and amy ?
what' s up , obsession ?
shut up .
so how long have you two been ...
three months .
shit or get off the pot time .
yep .
has even hinted that he' s aware of it ?
no , he' s acting oblivious .
are you gonna talk to her or hope you' re never forced to make an actual decision ?
i' m going with option " b " .
that' s my boy .
have you talked to him about it ?
no .
i' m playing hard to get .
oh , but haven' t you slept with him the past five nights ?
well , not real hard to get .
she really is a little badass though .
and fun to hang out with .
laid back .
maintenance fees are really low .
i like that .
yeah , she' s a cool chick .
i' d do her .
hell , i' d probably even pay .
i would .
i don' t know , man .
i' m not even thinking about amy right now .
who are you thinking about ?
chet miller .
come on , man !
you' re wracked with regret just because some old fuck boy classmate graduated college ?
are you gonna take the assistant manager job ?
wait .
how the hell do you know about that ?
are you fucking kidding me ?
you know this place .
people with the day off already know .
half of me is like take the job .
i could really use the money .
it' s a smart move .
but the other half' s like , " am i fucking nuts ?
do i really wanna end up like dan ?
busted .
hey , rocco ?
it' s dan down at shenaniganz .
got another one for ya .
all right .
not on my watch .
and there you go , folks .
damn , boy .
what the hell took so long ?
well , you had the two well done steaks , so it usually takes a little while to cook .
yeah , well , could you get me some more ketchup ?
sure .
no problem .
nothin ' sets off the flavor of a steak like some ketchup .
and his mouth tasted just like buttermilk .
hey , monty ?
could you drop off my food , please ?
i can' t deal with that bitch anymore .
no problem .
it' s go time , mitch .
hey , there , ladies .
amy' s busy so i thought i' d bring your food out .
but i still have some salad left .
oh , well , would you like me to take the food back and bring it out in a few minutes ?
yeah , and let it dry out under the heat lamps ?
just give me the food .
okay .
there you go .
wait .
did that waitress listen to a word i said ?
this steak is medium rare .
i asked for it medium .
and i wanted extra gravy on my mashed potatoes .
let me ask you something .
how hard is your job ?
how intelligent do you have to be to take a food order ?
jesus !
ma' am .
ma' am , you' re absolutely right , and i apologize .
i' m gonna get this fixed for you right away .
good .
now i can finish my salad .
okay .
gentlemen , we have our first official bee atch of the day .
oh , come on , guys .
she wasn' t that bad , was she ?
well , amy , it' s your table .
you decide .
she was a fucking bitch !
do it .
yo , we need to get some fucking hydroponics so we can grow our own shit , yo .
hells , yes .
soon as we get the hydro , we can run this city like the fuckin ' mob .
i swear , we gotta grow it , smoke it , sell it .
we' d be a fucking pimp .
yo , and you know the bitches be lovin ' that shit .
we' il get more fuckin ' puss than busta , more than dre , more than fuckin ' snoop dogg .
so it' s on then ?
we' re getting the fucking hydro .
we' re gonna run this city like the motherfucking mob .
the first thing we do is add a little extra gravy to the mashed potato .
ah , that' s it .
good job , buddy .
nice one .
followed by a thin spread of cheese for your garlic bread .
some " fromunda " cheese .
yeah , make us proud .
fresh from the taint .
we like this .
good .
up next , what we' re gonna do ...
how about a little guacamole for the steak ?
whoa , whoa , whoa .
what are you doing ?
come on , man .
you can' t be mixing mexican and continental .
come on , man .
i thought you was better than that .
all right .
how about a little garlic salt ?
that' s what i' m talking about .
finesse , baby !
these guys have a deep commitment to their job .
finally , a garnish of alfalfa sprouts .
adds a touch of cla ...
touch of class to any meal .
there we go .
oh , god .
good stuff .
i' il pull out my motherfuckin ' shotty .
pull up like john gotti .
i' il have the motherfucker on the carpet .
i fucked that bitch !
hell , yeah , motherfucker .

okay , nicholas , theodore .
boys .
it doesn' t take ten minutes to take out the trash .
now , if you don' t get your asses out front and start doing some work ,
i' m gonna fire you faster than you can say , " yo , mtv raps .
yes , sir .
i' m sorry ?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
hey , rocco .
yeah , right there .
here you go , ma' am .
i had the chefs take extra special care of it for you .
i' m truly sorry for the inconvenience .
don' t fuck with people that handle your food .
all right .
how you guys doin ' ?
everything prepared okay ?
could be better .
it' il do .
i' m sorry .
is there anything i can do to make it better ?
yeah , get me an extra roll .
and bring me the check .
sure .
no problem .
and i' m gonna sing that bitch a fucking 187 .
all right then , calvin .
just relax and start at the beginning .
okay .
about three months ago i just finished my shift , and i really had to take a piss .
so , i go into the bathroom .
and i' m at the urinal , just waiting for the flow , minding my own business .
when i notice out of my peripheral vision the guy standing next to me was looking straight at my dick .
he' s just staring at it like they' re old pals .
i could practically hear what he was thinking .
whoa .
that' s a nice dick .
and that' s it .
since that time , i haven' t been able to use a public bathroom .
goodness .
and the next time i tried to take a leak , i could' ve sworn the guy standing next to me was staring at me , and i freaked .
quit staring at my dick !
in retrospect , i think i might' ve been mistaken .
what about the stall ?
no , it didn' t work either .
every time i go to take a piss , i get the image of that guy' s eyes on my shank .
and then that' s when i start hearing the voices .
voices ?
i get this paranoid feeling there are people outside the stall , and they know i' m having a difficult time taking a piss .
i can hear them saying , " what' s taking him so long ?
why can' t he just piss like a normal person ?
i don' t hear any peel
i' m really fucked up .
psychosomatic auditory hallucinations .
most people have to pay for such a thing .
so what the hell should i do ?
well , first , you need to think about how this problem affects other parts of your personality .
oh .
see , i recommend ...
oh , bro , that ain' t right , man .
take a look at the bat wing , bitch !
oh , it' s so veiny .
damn , raddimus .
does danielle know that you like to go both ways ?
how does that work ?
sweet victory .
good job , asshole .
i' m sorry .
go ahead .
hello , sir .
my name is monty .
this is my trainee , mitch .
how are you doing today ?
oh , i' m slipping gradually into senility .
really ?
do you consider that a good thing or a bad thing ?
well , it' s a mixed bag .
it' s good in the sense that i can take walks in my underwear .
i can give small children the middle finger .
but as long as i look happy while i' m doing it , people just assume i' m senile .
yeah , so what' s the bad ?
well , sometimes i give small children the middle finger and don' t realize i' m doing it until someone slaps me .
so i really am going senile .
alzheimer' s can' t be all bad .
you get a chance to meet new people every day .
i like you , monty .
i like you too , sir .
i like you too , monty .
so what could i get you to drink ?
i trust you .
you know what ?
you can count on me , sir .
i don' t even care if he gives me a poor tip , that is the coolest old man i' ve met in my entire life .
how' s your table ?
couple of hicks .
yikes .
yeah , but the check total' s $63 , so even if they tip 15 percent i should make 10 bucks .
you' re a bastard .
so far i' ve made 15 percent of jack shit .
jesus .
there you go , buddy .
it' s all you .
thanks a lot .
we' il see you next time .
how much did they leave you ? $1 . 91 .
no fucking way .
excuse me , sir .
you forgot your change .
no .
that' s for you .
that' s your tip .
oh , no , no , no .
i insist .
you take it .
you obviously need this more than i do .
i wanna speak to your manager now , please .
this is horse shit .
okay , mitch , you see what dean did there ?
don' t ever do that .
what , did he stiff you ?
he might as fucking well have .
two bucks on a $63 check .
oh , damn .
that is pretty shitty .
for insulting me i should get some free gift certificates and a key chain and a hat .
absolutely , sir .
yes .
and how about a couple of sundaes with some nuts on ' em ?
yeah , i will have natasha take down all your information , and i will make sure corporate sends those to you .
you' re gonna mail me a sundae ?
i want it now .
get in here .
you wanna explain to me what the heck you were thinking ?
insulting a customer like that ?
you' re right .
i know .
i know .
he just ...
i' m having a really bad day , dan , and that guy caught me at the worst possible moment .
i' m sorry .
i lost it .
you' re sorry ?
i don' t understand .
i' ve never gotten a complaint on you .
and you had to pick the day i offer you a promotion ?
i promise you it won' t happen again , okay ?
opportunity is knocking at the door .
if you don' t wanna answer it , fine .
there are people who would jump at the chance .
calvin is chomping at the bit for this job .
i am offering you an opportunity to take it to the next level , earn more money .
i want an answer by the end of your shift ... tonight !
and dean , this is an exploding offer .
i don' t work within the exact boundaries of the law , because i wasn' t consulted when the goddamn laws were made .
no , instead , nameless , faceless politicians , the so called protectors of the moral majority decide what is right and what is wrong .
i mean , come on !
i govern my life around my own personal code of ethics , and i suggest you do the same .
that way if , within the constructs of my own morality
i were to do something that was considered illegal , so be it .
i feel no guilt whatsoever .
and furthermore , if i were to buckle under the social weight of the system by adhering to laws that i do not truly believe in , then i would be extinguishing the very fire of patriotism and individuality .
it' s ...
it' s so ...
in a sense , by having sex with natasha ,
i' d be preserving the rights our forefathers fought and died for , right ?
well , i guess ...
bro , it was a rhetorical question .
okay ?
so ...
oh , hey , dean .
i heard dan yelling at you .
it was kind of crazy .
you think you' re still in the running for the assistant manager ?
did you ever just wake up and realize , " holy shit .
i' m a fucking loser .
yeah , man .
god , i just wanna be able to say , " i wanna be a teacher , " you know , or a podiatrist or a fucking electrical engineer .
anything !
just have a fucking clue !
hey , who has a clue , right ?
hey , i don' t .
hello ?
i don' t know what' s going on .
hey , could you put down the ice pick ?
sorry you had to hear that guy yell .
oh , it' s okay .
you shouldn' t have to be subjected to that .
you' re way too sweet .
way too cute , too .
stop it .
you' re gonna make me blush .
bet you drive the boys wild at your school .
maybe .
i don' t really like the boys at my school .
no ?
why ?
i prefer older men .
really ?
wow .
i like a man in power .
yeah , well , being a manager , obviously , i know what you mean .
it takes a lot of power to command the respect of everybody at the restaurant .
that' s true .
yeah .
we should go to dinner sometime and talk about it .
i' il bring my manager card , and we' il just eat for free .
as they say , membership has its privileges .
what' s up with you ?
what are you still doing here ?
christy asked me to work for her , so i' m working a double .
time out .
isn' t this your only night off this week ?
yeah .
and you' re using it to work a double shift for christy ?
wait .
you actually have to get the pussy before you can be whipped by it .
that' s right .
you guys suck .
yes , we do .
wait .
didn' t you take out christy last night ?
yeah , we went out last night .
come on , man !
details !
fuck the details .
i wanna know .
did you do it ?
did you make a move ?
what do you mean ?
don' t give me that shit .
you know .
did you kiss her ?
rub against her skin ?
cuddle with her ?
rub her leg ?
hold her hand ?
nipple tweak ?
anything ?
no , i' m still ...
oh , my god !
i need more time .
forget it .
it' s over .
you' re fucked .
not literally .
why ?
because you won' t pull the trigger .
and you' re too fucking nice !
why do you always say that ?
i' m not ...
what happens with every girl you like ?
nothing !
you take ' em out , you pay for everything , and you never make a move !
then you home , alone , to masturbate while you cry , using your own tears ...
that was once , and i was drunk and it was valentine' s day .
so back off .
don' t try to candy coat it .
all we ever do is hang out and have sex .
what are you talking about ?
didn' t i take you to the movies last week , huh ?
huh ?
yeah , but you kept trying to get me to jerk you off .
what do you want ?
it was a dull movie .
yeah , but i just get the feeling that you don' t care .
i don' t care ?
i don' t care ?
when my uncle died , didn' t i ask you to be by my side at the funeral ?
yeah , but you kept trying to get me to jerk you off .
how many times can we have the same exact conversation ?
it' s like we' re stuck in a time paradox where neither our wisdom nor your virginity will ever escape .
i attempt to make a move .
i get in close .
i' m there and i just get ...
fuck !
you need therapy .
hush , now .
the way i see it , with chicks , there' s really only two possible things that could happen .
either they won' t sleep with you , and then there' s no need to call them again , or they do sleep with you , and then there' s no need to call them again .
this is what i don' t get .
how can someone be such a complete asshole all the time and get as many women as you do ?
that' s a good question .
amy !
serena !
calvin needs our help .
no .
amy !
serena !
calvin needs our help .
no .
no , i don' t need help .
shh , shh .
women like assholes , am i right ?
well , i agree that you' re an asshole .
okay .
a " , fuck you .
b " , just answer the question .
well , okay .
girls like assholes , not women .
what women are attracted to is self confidence .
yes , and we absolutely fucking hate insecurity .
yes !
the more insecure you are the more you ask , " is something wrong ?
" is everything okay ?
" what are you thinking about ?
what' s wrong ?
and the more you do that , calvin , the more it becomes this self fulfilling prophecy .
you just need to relax and not worry so much .
okay ?
yeah .
that makes a lot of sense .
i' m gonna work on it .
yeah .
yeah , you do that .
and by the way , take whatever advice that she gives you with a big grain of salt .
yeah , and take anything that he gives you with a shot of penicillin .
seriously , calvin , do yourself a favor .
unless you' re combing the playground for middle schoolers , don' t become an asshole like monty .
correct me if i' m wrong , but haven' t i been inside you ?
oh , monty .
oh , me .
you wanna brag about your sexual conquests , you big stud , you ?
okay , you know what ?
fine .
let' s talk about it .
let me describe monty' s amazing sexual prowess .
he' d barrel into me with that pathetic excuse for a child' s penis .
and it would end so quickly , so abruptly ,
i wouldn' t even have time to feel any sort of morbid , accidental amusement towards his " technique , " which was basically him seizuring on top of me for , oh , about 45 seconds , while i laid there trying not to laugh ... or cry .
ouch .
is it any wonder why you still date girls in high school ?
they' re the only ones left .
they don' t know any better .
okay , okay .
all right .
first of all , for the record ,
i always had an orgasm when we had sex .
secondly , everybody knows that i' m orally fixated .
you can' t deny that i played your vagina like a violin .
oh !
as if that somehow negates the fact that once we got past foreplay , you turned into the little engine that couldn' t hold his load .
oh , what the fuck ever !
if i was that bad , then why were you at my house every night ?
all i had to do was call and say , " hey .
i' m horny .
and then fucking poof !
as if by some form of slut magic you' d appear .
now why is that ?
because at first , i really liked spending time with you .
i thought you were a genuinely interesting guy to be around .
very true .
but eventually , it all wore thin .
i realized that your personality was just one short punctuated joke after another , much like our sex life .
and , oh , monty , do you remember why we stopped dating ?
yeah , i do .
because you were old news .
i was looking at other girls and getting bored .
basically , that was why .
yeah , yeah .
all that .
and the fact that i dumped you .
wait , i thought you said you dumped ...
shut up , calvin .
i was just trying to let you down easy , but this is bullshit .
we both know that you enjoyed having sex with me .
the only real pleasure i ever got from having sex with you came from making fun of it later with my friends .
tell him , amy .
it' s true .
we laughed a lot at your expense .
so you know when you' re walking past a group of people , you hear them laughing , you sometimes get that paranoid self conscious feeling ?
maybe they' re laughing about you when they' re really not ?
well , in your case , they really are .
god , i love her .
oh , hello there .
thank you for joining our family at shenaniganz bar and grill .
it is our goal to maintain the absolute highest standard in all aspects ...
hey , man .
we all had to watch it .
i' m gonna come back and get you after the dinner rush .
the tape should be done then .
cool ?
well , i mean , i guess .
l ... ... of our most sacred company policies to ensure that you have all the skills necessary
to uphold our standard of excellence .
shit .
are you ready ?
well , okay .
follow me .
all right , men .
this is it .
the time has come .
remember , product pride .
portion consciousness .
zero hour is upon us .
let us seize the day !
yeah , yeah !
carpe deez nuts .
god , i can' t wait to quit this job !
okay , your waiter will be right with you .
hi there , folks .
what can i get you to drink ?
would you like to start with an appetizer ?
would you like a baked potato , french fries or rice pilaf ?
order up !
is everything prepared okay ?
how about some dessert ?
and here you go , folks .
i hope you enjoyed everything .
i know i did .
fuck !
