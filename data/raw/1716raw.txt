why do you think ziegler invites us to these things every year ?
this is what you get for making house calls .

i went to medical school with him .

he plays pretty good for a doctor .
he' s not a doctor .
he dropped out .
ladies and gentlemen , i hope you ' re enjoying yourselves .
the band' s going to take a break .

nightingale .

so how you doing ?
not too bad , you know .
not too bad .
i see you' ve become a pianist .
oh , yes , well , my friends call me that .
how about you ?
you still in the doctor business ?
once a doctor , always a doctor .
never a doctor , never a doctor .
i never did understand why you walked away .
it' s a nice feeling .
i do it a lot .
cheers .
excuse me .
nick , i need you a minute .
be right with you .
i gotta go do something .
lf i don' t catch you later . . . . . . l' il be down at the village for two weeks at the sonata caf .
stop by if you get a chance .
i' il be there .
it' s great seeing you .
good seeing you too , man .
i think that' s my glass .
l ' m absolutely certain of it .
my name is sandor szavost .
l ' m hungarian .
my name is alice harford .
l ' m american .
delighted to meet you , alice .
did you ever read the latin poet ovid on the art of love ?
didn' t he wind up all by himself . . . . . . crying his eyes out . . . . . . in some place with a very bad climate ?
but he also had a good time first .
a very good time .
are you here with anyone tonight , alice ?
with my husband .
oh , how sad .
but then l ' m sure he' s the sort of man who wouldn' t mind if we danced .
what do you do , alice ?
well , at the moment . . . . . . l ' m looking for a job .
i used to manage an art gallery in soho .
but it went broke .
what a shame .
i have some friends in the art game .
perhaps i can be of some help .
thank you .
someone you know ?
my . . . . . . husband .
don' t you think one of the charms of marriage . . . . . . is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties ?
may i ask why a beautiful woman . . . . . . who could have any man in this room , wants to be married ?
why wouldn' t she ?
ls it as bad as that ?
as good as that .
do you know nuala windsor ?
no , and it' s very lovely to meet you both .
how do you spell nuala ?
n u a l a.
you don' t remember me , do you ?
you were very kind to me once .
only once ?
that sounds like a terrible oversight !
i was doing a photo session in rockefeller plaza . . . . . . on a very windy day . . . ?
and you got something in your eye .
just about half of fifth avenue .
you were such a gentleman !
you gave me your handkerchief . . . . . . which was also clean .
that is the kind of hero i can be sometimes .
you know why women used to get married , don' t you ?
why don' t you tell me ?
it was the only way they could lose their virginity . . . . . . and be free to do what they wanted with other men .
the ones they really wanted .
fascinating .
do you know what' s so nice about doctors ?
usually a lot less than people imagine .
they always seem so . . . . . . knowledgeable .
oh , they are very knowledgeable . . . . . . about all sorts of things .
but i bet they work too hard .
just think of all they miss .
you ' re probably right .
ladies , where exactly are we going ?
exactly ?
where the rainbow ends .
where the rainbow ends ?
don' t you want to go where the rainbow ends ?
now that depends where that is .
well , let' s find out .
excuse me , ladies .
sorry , dr. harford .
could you come with me for a moment ?
something for mr. ziegler .
fine .
to be continued ?
bill , thanks for coming .
we had a little accident here .
what happened ?
well , she was . . . .
she was shooting up and she had a bad reaction .
what did she take ?
a speedball or a snowball or whatever the hell they call it .
it' s heroin and coke .
heroin and coke ?
anything else ?
we had a couple of drinks , some champagne .
that was it .
how long has she been like this ?
maybe five minutes , six minutes , something like that .
what' s her name ?
mandy .
can you hear me , mandy ?
can you hear me ?
move your head if you can hear me .
move your head if you can hear me , mandy .
there you go .
you can hear me .
can you open your eyes for me ?
mandy , can you do that ?
let me see you open your eyes .
there you go , come on .
come on , look at me .
look at me .
look at me .
look at me .
look at me .
look at me , mandy .
good .
good .
i love victor' s art collection , don' t you ?
it' s wonderful .
have you ever seen his sculpture gallery ?
i haven' t .
he has a wonderful collection of renaissance bronzes .
do you like the period ?
i do .
i adore it .
the sculpture gallery is upstairs .
would you like to see it ?
i can show it to you .
we won' t be gone long .
maybe . . .
. . . not just . . .
. . . now .
that was really one hell of a scare you gave us , kiddo .
sorry .
how are you feeling now , mandy ?
better .
you are a very , very lucky girl .
you know that ?
i know .
you ' re gonna be okay this time .
but you can' t keep doing this .
you understand ?
you ' re going to need some rehab .
you know that , don' t you ?
i know .
well , victor . . .
. . . l' il leave the rest to you .
ls it okay if i dress her and get her out of here ?
no , i' d keep her here for another hour .
another hour ?
then i' d have someone take her home .
good night , mandy .
i can' t thank you enough for this .
you saved my ass .
l ' m glad i was here .
bill , i probably . . . .
i know i don' t have to mention this . . . . . . but this is just between us .
of course .
thanks .
i think i' ve had a little too much champagne .
i think i have to go and find my husband now .
but l ' m sure he' il be all right on his own a little longer .
yes . . .
. . . but will l ?
of course you will .
i really have to go .
i have to go .
you don' t , you know .
yes , i do .
i must see you again .
that' s impossible .
why ?
because . . .
. . . l ' m married .
good morning , lisa .
good morning , doctor .
your mail .
good .
please ask janelle to bring me my coffee .
sure .
thank you .
good morning , sarah .
good morning , doctor . " ' twas the night before christmas , when all through the house ... ... not a creature was stirring , not even a mouse .
okay .
that' s fine .
you can put your gown on .
hold this for mommy .
looking forward to christmas ?
does this hurt ?
right there ?
daddy' s gonna like that .
very good choice . " before me . . . . . . when i jump into my bed .
we should call the zieglers and thank them for the party .
i' ve taken care of that .
good .
so how do you feel about wrapping the rest of the presents ?
let' s do that tomorrow .
tell me something .
those two girls . . .
. . . at the party last night . . . .
did you . . . . . . by any chance . . . . . . happen to . . .
. . . fuck them ?
what ?
what are you talking about ?
l ' m talking about the two girls . . . . . . that you were so blatantly hitting on .
i wasn' t hitting on anybody .
who were they ?
they were just a couple of models .
and where did you disappear to with them for so long ?
wait a minute .
i didn' t disappear with anybody .
ziegler wasn' t feeling too well . . . . . . and i got called upstairs to see him .
anyway , who was the guy you were dancing with ?
a friend of the zieglers .
what did he want ?
what did he want ?
sex . . .
. . . upstairs .
then and there .
ls that all ?
yeah , that was all .
just wanted to fuck my wife .
that' s right .
well , i guess that' s understandable .
understandable ?
because you are a very . . . . . . very beautiful woman .
wait .
because l ' m a beautiful woman . . . . . . the only reason any man ever wants to talk to me . . .
. . . is because he wants to fuck me .
ls that what you ' re saying ?
well , i don' t think it' s quite that black and white . . .
. . . but i think we both know what men are like .
so on that basis . . . . . . l should conclude that you wanted to fuck those two models .
there are exceptions .
and what makes you an exception ?
what makes me an exception is that . . .
. . . l happen to be in love with you .
and because we ' re married . . . . . . and because i would never lie to you . . . . . . or hurt you .
do you realize that what you ' re saying . . . . . . is that the only reason you wouldn' t fuck those models . . . . . . is out of consideration for me ?
not because you really wouldn' t want to .
let' s just relax , alice .
this pot is making you aggressive .
no !
it' s not the pot .
it' s you !
why can' t you ever give me a straight fucking answer ?
i was under the impression that' s what i was doing .
i don' t even know what we ' re arguing about here .
l ' m not arguing .
l ' m just trying to find out where you ' re coming from .
where l ' m coming from ?
let' s say , for example , you have some gorgeous woman . . . . . . standing in your office naked . . . . . . and you ' re feeling her fucking tits .
now , what i want to know . . . .
i want to know what you ' re thinking about when you ' re squeezing them .
alice , i happen to be a doctor .
it' s all very impersonal . . . . . . and you know there' s always a nurse present .
so when you ' re feeling tits , it' s nothing more than your professionalism ?
exactly .
sex is the last thing on my mind when l ' m with a patient .
now , when she is having her little titties squeezed . . . . . . do you think she ever has fantasies . . . . . . about what handsome dr. bill' s dickie might be like ?
come on , i can assure you sex is the last thing . . . . . . on this fucking hypothetical woman patient' s mind .
and what makes you so sure ?
lf for no better reason . . . . . . because she' s afraid of what i might find .
so after you tell her that everything' s fine , what then ?
what then ?
i don' t know , alice . . . .
what then ?
women don' t . . . .
they basically just don' t think like that .
millions of years of evolution , right ?
men have to stick it every place they can . . . . . . but for women , it is just about security and commitment . . . . . . and whatever the fuck else !
a little oversimplified , alice .
but yes , something like that .
lf you men only knew .
what i do know is you got stoned , you tried to pick a fight . . . . . . and now you ' re trying to make me jealous .
but you ' re not the jealous type , are you ?
no , l ' m not .
you' ve never been jealous about me , have you ?
no , i haven' t .
and why haven' t you ever been jealous about me ?
well , i don' t know , alice .
maybe because you ' re my wife .
maybe because you ' re the mother of my child . . . . . . and i know you would never be unfaithful to me .
you are very , very sure of yourself . . . . . . aren' t you ?
no .
l ' m sure of you .
do you think that' s funny ?
all right .
fuck it .
now we get the fucking laughing fit , right ?
do you . . . .
do you remember last summer at cape cod ?
do you remember one night in the dining room . . . . . . there was this young naval officer . . . . . . and he was sitting near our table with two other officers ?
no .
the waiter brought him a message , at which point he left .
nothing rings a bell ?
well . . .
. . . l first saw him that morning in the lobby .
he was checking into the hotel . . . . . . and he was following the bellboy with his luggage . . . . . . to the elevator .
he glanced at me as he walked past .
just a glance .
nothing more .
but i could hardly . . .
. . . move .
that afternoon . . .
. . . helena went to the movies with her friend . . .
. . . and you and i made love .
and we made plans about our future . . .
. . . and we talked about helena .
and yet . . .
. . . at no time . . .
. . . was he ever . . .
. . . out of my mind .
and i thought if he wanted me . . .
. . . even if it was only . . .
. . . for one night . . .
. . . l was ready to give up everything .
you .
helena .
my whole fucking future .
everything .
and yet it was weird , because at the same time . . .
. . . you were dearer to me than ever .
and at that moment , my love for you . . .
. . . was both . . .
. . . tender and sad .
i barely slept that night . . .
. . . and i woke up the next morning in a panic .
i didn' t know whether i was afraid that he had left . . .
. . . or that he might still be there .
but by dinner . . .
. . . l realized he was gone . . .
. . . and i was . . . . . . relieved .
yes , this is dr. harford .
when did it happen ?
i have the address .
thank you .
lou nathanson just died .
i think i have to go over there and show my face .
hello , rosa .
good evening , dr. harford .
how is miss nathanson ?
not so good .
she' s in the bedroom .
thank you .
come in .
marion . . . .
oh , dr. harford . . . .
how good of you to come .
i came as soon as i got the message .
thank you .
l ' m so sorry .
thank you .
your father was . . . .
he was a very brave man .
oh , thank you .
how are you holding up ?
l ' m a bit numb .
i don' t think it' s really sunk in yet .
would you like to sit down ?
it' s so unreal .
daddy had such a good day .
his mind was clear , and he remembered so many things .
then he had a little dinner . . . . . . and he said he felt like taking a nap .
i went into the kitchen and talked to rosa for half an hour at most . . .
. . . and when i went to see how he was . . . . . . l just thought he was asleep .
then i realized he wasn' t breathing .
from what you' ve said . . . . . . l ' m sure your father died peacefully in his sleep .
oh , god , i hope so .
i think i' ve been more afraid of the way it was going to happen . . . . . . than his death itself .
have you had a chance to phone any of your relatives ?
i tried to call my stepmother in london , but she was out .
my boyfriend , carl , is making some calls . . . . . . and he' il be coming over soon .
i think you' ve met carl here a few times .
yes , i remember him .
he' s a teacher , isn' t he ?
a math professor .
we ' re going to get married in may .
well , that' s wonderful news .
congratulations .
thank you .
carl has a new teaching appointment at the university of michigan .
we' il be moving out there soon .
michigan' s a beautiful state .
i think you' il like it a lot .
it really could be a wonderful change for you , marion .
oh , my god , no . . . .
i love you .
i love you .
i love you , i love you , i love you .
i don' t want to go away with carl .
marion , i don' t think you realize
i do .
even if l ' m never to see you again , i want at least to live near you .
marion , listen to me .
listen to me .
you ' re very upset , and i don' t think you realize what you ' re saying .
i love you .
we barely know each other .
we haven' t had a single conversation about anything except your father .
i love you .
that' s probably carl .
please don' t despise me .
hello , rosa .
hello , mr. thomas .
ls she in the bedroom ?
yes , she is .
thank you .
come in .
darling .
l ' m so very sorry .
are you all right ?
l ' m okay .
dr. harford , good evening .
good evening , carl .
thank you very much for coming over here tonight .
it' s the least i could do .
it means a lot to us .
thank you .
i was actually on my way out .
marion . . .

thank you .
i' il show you out .
good night .

yes , l ' m afraid so .

okay , so you are dr. harford .
lf i see peter , i tell him you were looking for him .
oh , no , wait .
please , please . . . .
listen , the reason that i came here tonight was . . . .
basically , the reason is that i need a costume .
and i' d be happy to pay you $ 1 00 over the rental price . . . . . . for the inconvenience .
a hundred dollars ?
i don' t think so .
how about $200 ?
two hundred dollars over the rental price ?

can' t be too careful these days .
please .
ls it any special costume you are looking for ?
i need a tux , a cloak with a hood and a mask .

i think we' il find something for you .
follow me , please .
good .
looks like alive , huh ?
it' s wonderful .
come .
so what color cloak ?
red , brown , red ?
black .
the good doctor wouldn' t like something more colorful ?
i don' t think so .
clowns , officers , pirates ?
no , just the tux , the black cloak
with a hood and a mask .
may i take your coat ?
you are medicine doctor , yes ?
yes , i am .
i have some problem with my hair .
your hair ?
it' s starting to fall down too fast .
i lost , in two weeks , a lot of hair .
mostly here .
look at this .
here .
you see ?
and ?
l ' m afraid this really isn' t my field .
what ?
you can' t help me ?

you should see a trichologist .
it' s a hair specialist .
mr. milich , i' ve obviously left things a bit late tonight .
so if you don' t mind
l ' m in hurry too , to get back to bed .
i understand .
so black cloak ?

good evening , sir .
good evening .
password , sir ?
fidelio .
thank you , sir .
l ' m not sure what you think you ' re doing .
but you don' t belong here .
l ' m sorry , but i think you' ve mistaken me for someone else .
please !
don' t be foolish .
you must go now .
who are you ?
it doesn' t matter who i am .
you are in great danger .
you must get away while there' s still a chance .
would you be so good as to excuse us for a moment ?
have you been enjoying yourself ?
well , i' ve had a very interesting look around .
do you want to go somewhere a little more private ?
private ?
that might be a good idea .
here you are .
i' ve been looking all over for you .
may i borrow him for just a few minutes ?
i promise to bring him right back .
i don' t think you realize the danger you ' re in now .
you can' t fool them for much longer .
you' ve got to get away before it' s too late .
why are you telling me this ?
it doesn' t matter .
who are you ?
you don' t want to know .
but you must go .
now !
will you come with me ?
that' s impossible .
why ?
because it would cost me my life and possibly yours .
let me see your face .
go !
excuse me , sir .
are you the gentleman with the taxi waiting for him ?
yes .
your driver' s at the front door and would urgently like a word with you .
please , come forward .
may i have the password , please ?
fidelio .
that' s right , sir .
that is the password . . . . . . for admittance .
but may i ask , what is the password for the house ?
the password for the house ?
l ' m sorry , l . . . .
i seem to have . . .
. . . forgotten it .
that' s unfortunate .
because here , it doesn' t matter whether you have forgotten it . . . . . . or if you never knew it .
you will kindly remove your mask .
now . . . . . . get undressed .
get undressed ?
remove your clothes .
gentlemen , please . . . .
remove your clothes .
or would you like us to do it for you ?
stop !
let him go .
take me !
i am ready to redeem him .
you are ready to redeem him ?
yes .
are you sure you understand what you ' re taking upon yourself . . . . . . in doing this ?
very well .
you are free .
but i warn you . . . . . . if you make any further inquiries . . . . . . or if you say a single word to anyone . . . . . . about what you have seen . . . . . . there will be the most dire consequences for you . . . . . . and your family .
do you understand ?
what is going to happen to that woman ?
no one can change her fate now .
when a promise has been made here . . . . . . there is no turning back .
go !
it' s okay .
l ' m sorry .
l ' m sorry i woke you up , but i thought you were having a nightmare .
oh , god .
i just had such a horrible dream .
what time is it ?
it' s a little after 4 .
did you just get home ?
it took longer than i thought .
you must be exhausted .
come on , lie down .
what were you dreaming ?
just these weird things .
what was it ?
it was so weird .
tell me .
we were in a deserted city . . .
. . . and our clothes were gone .
we were naked . . .
. . . and i was terrified . . .
. . . and i felt ashamed .
oh , god . . . .
and i was angry because i thought it was your fault .
you rushed away to go find clothes for us .
as soon as you were gone , it was completely different .
i felt wonderful .
then i was lying in a beautiful garden . . . . . . stretched out naked in the sunlight . . .
. . . and a man walked out of the woods .
he was the man from the hotel , the one i told you about .
the naval officer .
he stared at me . . .
. . . and then he just laughed .
he just laughed at me .
but that' s not the end . . .
. . . is it ?
why don' t you tell me the rest of it ?
it' s too awful .
it' s only a dream .
he was kissing me . . .
. . . and then we were making love .
then there were all these other people around us . . . . . . hundreds of them , everywhere .
everyone was fucking .
and then l . . . .
i was fucking other men .
so many . . .
. . . l don' t know how many i was with .
and i knew you could see me in the arms of all these men . . .
. . . just fucking all these men .
i wanted to make fun of you . . .
. . . to laugh in your face .
and so i laughed as loud as i could .
that must have been when you woke me up .
shit !
i' il just have a cup of coffee , please .
anything else ?
no , thank you .
excuse me .
do you know when they get in next door at the sonata caf ?
i think there' s usually someone in the office around 2 or 3 .
i don' t suppose , by any chance , you know nick nightingale ?
he' s playing piano over there right now .
nick nightingale ?
sure , he comes in here .
look , maybe you can help me . . . . . . because it' s important that i get in touch with him .
do you know where he' s staying ?
i don' t know if he' d want me to give out his address .
it' s okay , l ' m a doctor .
l ' m actually an old friend of his .
well , doctor . . .
. . . he' il be playing there tonight .
can' t it wait until then ?
to be perfectly honest . . .
. . . it' s a medical matter .
some tests .
i know he' il want to know about them as soon as possible .
excuse me .
hi !
how can i help you ?
can you please ring mr. nightingale' s room for me ?
l ' m sorry , sir , mr. nightingale has already checked out .
he checked out ?
did he leave a forwarding address ?
no , l ' m afraid not .
when did he check out ?
about 5 : 00 this morning .
5 : 00 ?
that' s an early checkout , isn' t it ?
it is a little on the early side , yeah .
did you notice anything . . . . . . l don' t know . . . . . . unusual about him when he left ?
unusual ?
hey , you ' re not five o , are you ?
no , l ' m an old friend of his .
really ?
l ' m a doctor .
well , bill . . . ?
sure .
it' s funny you should ask that question , bill . . . . . . because there was something a little strange . . . . . . about the way mr. nightingale left .
really ?
what was that ?
he came in this morning , about 4 : 30 a . m . . . . . . with two men .
big guys .
they were very well dressed and very well spoken .
but they weren' t the kind of people you' d fool around with . . . . . . if you know what i mean .
anyways . . .
. . . l noticed mr. nightingale had a bruise on his cheek .
to be perfectly honest , i also thought he looked a little scared .
scared ?
he said he wanted to check out .
and then he went upstairs to his room with one of the men .
the other guy stayed down in the lobby and settled his bill .
when they came back , mr. nightingale tried to pass me an envelope .
but they saw it and took it . . . . . . and said that any mail or messages for him . . . . . . would be collected by someone properly authorized to do so .
and then they just took him off in a car .
do you have any idea where they went ?
no , not a clue .
i certainly appreciate your help .
anytime , bill .
oh , the good doctor !
was your outfit a success ?
yes , it was .
thank you .
good , good .
tuxedo .
cloak .
shoes .
i think you forgot the mask .
it' s not there ?
maybe you left it at the party ?
i don' t think so .
i must have lost it .
could you put it on the bill , please ?
sure .
here we are .
that was 1 50 for the rental , 200 you said for my trouble . . . . . . 25 for the mask .
sorry . . . .
three hundred seventy five .
yes , dear ?
come , come .
would you like to say hello to dr. harford ?
thank you , mr. milich .
i' il call you soon .
goodbye , gentlemen .
merry christmas and happy new year !
and you too .
well , dr. harford . . .
. . . here is your receipt .
l ' m tearing up your deposits . . .
. . . and thanks for the business .
mr. milich , last night . . .
. . . you were going to call the police .
things change .
we have come to another arrangement .
and by the way , if the good doctor should ever want anything again . . . . . . anything at all . . . . . . it needn' t be a costume .
come in .
tuna salad and black coffee .
thanks .
listen , how' s my afternoon looking ?
i think it' s just mrs. akerly at 2 : 30 and mrs. kominski at 4 .
well , something' s come up , and l ' m not going to be able to see them .
please ask dr. miller if he can fit them in .
otherwise , just apologize . . . . . . and make new appointments .
sure .
and please call the garage and have them get my car out in half an hour .
no problem .
any calls for me ?
dr. sanders and mrs. shapiro .
hey , gang .
hi , daddy .
look , i got all these right .
you got all of those right ?
every single one of them ?
that' s good .
you hungry ?
sort of .
want to eat at 7 ?
seven ?
listen , can we make that earlier ?
i have some appointments at the office .
you have to go out again tonight ?
l ' m afraid so .
daddy , am i gonna get a puppy for christmas ?
we' il see about that , okay ?
he could be a watchdog . . . .
we' il see .
come on , baby , let' s finish this off .
all right , we have joe .
and joe has $2 . 50 .
and mike has $ 1 . 75 .
joe has how much more money than mike ? $0 . 75 ?
so is it gonna be a subtraction or an addition ?
how much more " means that it would be a subtraction .
yeah , because you ' re going to be taking .
right .
and there were all these other people around us .
hundreds of them , everywhere .
everyone was fucking .
and then i ....
i was fucking other men .
so many ... ... i don' t know how many i was with .
keep the change .
merry christmas .
what is it ?
domino ?
no , she' s not in .
are you expecting her back soon ?
no , l ' m not .
i have something for her .
can i leave this with you ?
just a minute .
can i say who it' s from ?
well , just tell her it' s from . . . . . . bill .
you ' re bill ?
the bill ?
you ' re the doctor who was here last night ?
well , i suppose i am .
domino said how nice you were to her .
did she ?
why don' t you come in for a second ?
sure .
l ' m sally .
hello , sally .
so do you have any idea when you expect domino back ?
i have no idea .
you have no idea ?
to be perfectly honest , she may not even be coming back .
she may not even be coming back ?
l . . . .
you . . . ?
i think there' s something that i should tell you .
really ?
but i just don' t know .
i don' t know .
you don' t know ?
well , what is it ?
i don' t know whether to tell you this .
why don' t you have a seat ?
let' s sit down .
i don' t quite know how to say this .
you don' t quite know how ?
well , considering that you were with domino last night . . .
. . . l think it would be only fair to you to let you know . . .
. . . that she got the results of a blood test this morning . . . . . . and it was hlv positive .
hlv positive ?
i am very , very sorry to hear that .
i mean , it' s absolutely devastating .
listen , can i offer you anything ?
a cup of coffee maybe ?
no , thank you .
i think . . .
. . . maybe i' d better be going .
taxi !
off duty .
i' il just have a cappuccino , please .
i' il bring it over to you .
thank you .
good evening .
good evening .
l ' m dr. harford .
one of my patients was admitted this morning .
miss amanda curran .
could you please give me her room number ?
certainly , doctor .
her name again ?
curran .
amanda curran .
c u r r a n ?
miss amanda curran ?
that' s right .
l ' m sorry , doctor .
miss curran died this afternoon .
she died this afternoon ?
yes , at 3 : 45 p . m .
l ' m sorry .
because it could cost me my life ... ... and possibly yours .
yes , this is dr. harford .
tonight ?
no , no , that' s okay .
please tell him i' il be there in about 20 minutes .
come in .
bill , i appreciate you coming .
sorry to drag you out here .
let me have your coat .
i was out anyway .
thank you .
how about a drink ?
are you having one ?
sure .
what would you like ?
just a little scotch .
good .
how do you take it ?
neat ?
please .
that was a terrific party the other night .
alice and i had a wonderful time .
well , good .
it was great seeing you both .
cheers .
were you playing ?
no , i was just knocking a few balls around .
beautiful scotch .
that' s a 25 year old .
i' il send you over a case .
no , please .
why not ?
you feel like playing ?
no , thanks .
you go ahead , i' il watch .
i was just . . . .
listen . . . .
the reason i asked you to come over is . . .
. . . l need to talk to you about something .
sure .
it' s a little bit awkward .
and i have to be completely frank .
what kind of problem are you having ?
it isn' t a medical problem .
actually . . .
. . . it concerns you .
i know what happened last night .
and i know what' s been going on since then .
and i think you just might . . .
. . . have the wrong idea about one or two things .
l ' m sorry , victor , l . . . .
what in the hell are you talking about ?
please , bill , no games .
i was there .
at the house .
i saw everything that went on .
what the hell did you think you were doing ?
i couldn' t even begin to imagine . . .
. . . how you' d heard about it . . . . . . let alone got yourself through the door .
then i remembered seeing you with that prick piano player . . . . . . nick whatever the fuck his name was , at my party .
and it didn' t take much to figure out the rest .
it wasn' t nick' s fault .
it was mine .
of course it was nick' s fault .
lf he hadn' t mentioned it to you , none of this would' ve happened .
i recommended that cocksucker to those people . . . . . . and he' s made me look like a complete asshole .
what can i say ?
i had . . .
. . . absolutely . . . . . . no idea you were involved in any way .
i know you didn' t , bill .
but i also know that you . . . .
you went to nick' s hotel this morning . . . . . . and talked to the desk clerk .
how do you know that ?
because i had you followed .
you had me followed ?
okay , okay , l ' m sorry .
all right ?
i owe you an apology .
this was for your own good , believe me .
i know what the desk clerk told you .
but what he didn' t tell you is . . . . . . all they did was put nick on a plane to seattle .
by now he' s probably back with his family . . . . . . banging mrs. nick .
the clerk said he had a bruise on his face .
okay , he had a bruise on his face .
that' s a hell of a lot less than he deserves .
i don' t think you realize what kind of trouble you were in last night .
who do you think those people were ?
those were not just ordinary people there .
lf i told you their names l ' m not gonna tell you their names . . . . . . but if i did , i don' t think you' d sleep so well .
was it the second password ?
ls that what gave me away ?
yes , finally .
but not because you didn' t know it .
it' s because there was no second password .
of course it didn' t help a whole lot that those people arrive in limos . . . . . . and you showed up in a taxi .
or that they found the receipt from the rental house in your coat . . . . . . made out to you know who .
there was a woman there . . .
. . . who tried to warn me .
i know .
do you know who she was ?
she was a hooker .
sorry , but . . .
. . . that' s what she was .
a hooker .
suppose i told you . . .
. . . that everything that happened to you there . . .
. . . the threats , the girl' s warnings . . . . . . her last minute intervention . . . . . . suppose i said that all of that . . .
. . . was staged .
that it was a kind of charade .
that it was fake .
fake ?
yes .
fake .
why would they do that ?
why ?
ln plain words . . . . . . to scare the living shit out of you .
to keep you quiet about where you' d been . . . . . . and what you' d seen .
have you seen this ?
yes , i have .
i saw her body in the morgue .
was she the woman at the party ?
she was .
the woman lying dead in the morgue . . .
. . . was the woman at the party .
well , victor , maybe l ' m missing something here .
you called it a fake , a charade .
do you mind telling me what kind of fucking charade . . . . . . ends with somebody turning up dead ?
okay , bill , let' s cut the bullshit .
all right ?
you' ve been way out of your depth for the last 24 hours .
you want to know what kind of charade ?
i' il tell you exactly what kind .
that whole play acted , " take me " phony sacrifice . . . . . . that you' ve been jerking off with had nothing to do with her real death .
nothing happened after you left that hadn' t happened to her before .
she got her brains fucked out .
period .
when they took her home , she was just fine . . . . . . and the rest is in the paper .
she was a junkie .
she od' d .
there was nothing suspicious .
her door was locked from the inside .
the police are happy .
end of story .
come on .
it was always gonna be just a matter of time with her .
remember , you told her so yourself .
you remember , the one with the great tits who od' d in my bathroom ?
listen , bill , nobody killed anybody .
someone died .
it happens all the time .
but life goes on .
it always does . . . . . . until it doesn' t .
but you know that , don' t you ?
i' il tell you everything .
i' il tell you everything .
helena' s gonna be up soon .
she' s expecting us to take her christmas shopping today .
that' s nice .
i could put sabrina in here .
it' s really pretty .
it' s old fashioned .
he' s big .
i hope santa claus gets me one of these for christmas .
you do ?
well , you ' re gonna have to wait and see .
what do you think we should do ?
what do i think we should do ?
look , mommy !
what do i think ?
i don' t know .
i mean , maybe . . . .
maybe i think . . . . . . we should be grateful .
grateful . . . . . . that we' ve managed to survive through all of our . . . . . . adventures . . .
. . . whether they were real . . . . . . or only a dream .
are you sure of that ?
am i sure ?
only as sure as i am . . . . . . that the reality of one night . . .
. . . let alone that of a whole lifetime . . .
. . . can ever be the whole truth .
and no dream is ever . . .
. . . just a dream .
the important thing is . . .
. . . we ' re awake now . . .
. . . and hopefully . . .
. . . for a long time to come .
forever .
forever ?
forever .
let' s not use that word .
you know ?
it frightens me .
but i do love you . . .
. . . and you know . . .
. . . there is something very important . . . . . . that we need to do as soon as possible .
what' s that ?
fuck .
