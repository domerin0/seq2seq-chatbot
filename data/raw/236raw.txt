i just love mushrooms ,
one of my favorites , or as i call it ,,, ,,, the king of mushrooms , is the porcini ,
now , stop right there ,
don' t be alarmed ,
there' s a lot of confusion in this country between porcini ,,, ,,, the italian name , and cpes , which is the french name , ,,, the italian name , and cpes , which is the french name ,
they' re fat and they' re earthy ,
now , the porcini is most often seen dried here in this country ,
and they would always be labeled ,,, ,,, dried porcinis , not dried cpes .

i' m sorry , billy .
you' re goddamn right you are .
what' d he do ?
pissed off the wrong people .
i don' t have to remind you what happens when you do that , do i ?
so i bought him some forgiveness .
but if i don' t bring him back to face the music ... ... you know damn well that i can' t carry a tune .
so you deliver my boy back here , you bring him right through that door ... ... you walk out of this house a free man , with a restaurant .
is that duct tape ?
don' t worry there , little fella .
walk by faith , not by sight .
will you look at that ?
we can' t land now .

why can' t we land ?
they got the bulls on the ground .
booze on the grind " ?

poison arrow frogs , black flies , bullet ants .
if they don' t get you , the rebels will .

rebels .
that' s what i' m telling you .
to them , cornelius hatcher' s built a babylon in paradise .
built a what ?
a babylon .
yeah , that mine is as close as a man can come to the gates of hell ... ... while his heart' s still beating .
the sunday school picnic is over , i' il tell you that .
stay out of the jungle , little fella , okay ?
i found these flowers growing in the deepest parts of the jungle .
i mean , as far as i can tell , no one' s ever identified them ... ... which means i' m responsible for naming them .
i can only think of one word that fits something so beautiful .
mariana .
how much do you want ?
what ?
how much ?
i need your uncle' s boat .
a day or two , max .
mariana ...
you borrow my car , bring it back with no windshield .
my brother' s scooter ...
that wasn' t my fault .
now you want to borrow my uncle' s boat ?
i found it , i found it . " you' il never find this garbo of yours .
it' s " gato , " i told you .
gato .
it' s out there , mariana .
i know exactly where it is .
but i need that boat .
how much ?
i told you , i ...
no .
how much is your gato worth ?
this is a very significant academic find .
how much ?
it' s not about money .
you lie like a little girl , travis .
i' m not lying .
if i get the boat for you , you have to take me with you .
ridiculous .
we' re talking about a boat .
and we split the take 50 50 .
i' ve been doing all the work , okay ?
i found it .
no way .
50 50 , travis .
70 30 .
50 50 .
60 40 .
50 50 , and i get off work at 6 .
then we can go and get your gato .
you' re evil .
thank you .
whatever .
for the flowers .
harvey !
we' re here to see your brother .
where' s he from ?
he' s an american , you got a gun ?
no , i don' t like guns .
check him .
what' s the current payout ?
give me a payout for quadrant 3 .
2425 , down 20 percent .
checked him ?
all right , let' s go .
come on .
come on .
i never met an american who didn' t like guns .
tell them to dig harder .
if only it were that simple , eh , mr. beck ?
how do you know my name ?
when a man of your dimensions ... ... travels all this way to visit a place like this ... ... it arouses the curiosity .
what can i do for you ?
do you know this man ?
travis walker .
i let him excavate around the mine ... ... allow him to rent a room in my town ... ... all for a fair 60 percent of anything he might unearth .
where can i find him ?
follow the bullshit .
guy' s mouth should be in the circus .
brother , please .
do you have business with him ?
i do .
what kind of business ?
i love business .
it' s personal .
so ... ... why come to me ?
when i' m a guest in a man' s house ... ... i don' t reach into his refrigerator without permission .
refrigerator .
i want to show you something , mr. beck , please .
does that look like a refrigerator to you ?
looks more like hell .
where you see hell , i see a spellbinding sense of purpose .
i see the value of keeping your eye on the ball .
when a bride slips the ring on her finger ,,, ,,, when a businessman lays his hands on a rolex ,,, ,,, when a rapper gets a shiny new tooth , this is that cost , mr , beck ,
my horror for their beauty .
my hell for their little slice of heaven .
somebody' s gotta keep his eye on the ball ,
that somebody is me , mr , beck ,
i am down here every day keeping my eye on the ball ,
that' s just a simple fact of life ,
and if you' re bold enough to face that cold , hard fact ,,, ... you can make a lot of money .
what do you want with the kid ?
i' ve come to take him home .
that' il cost you $ 10, 000 .
i need to borrow the jeep .
wait a minute , friend .
i' il give you $ 1000 .
i' il give you $ 1000 .
i need you to take my bag back to the plane , keep the engine running .
can you do that ?
for $ 1000 ?
that' s right .
i' il find a way .
declan .
i' m gonna be coming fast .
american ?
yeah .
where from ?
someplace that' s got bartenders .
what can i get you ?
i' il take a beer .
nice flowers .
the smiling fool .
back in the states , brazil nuts like these go for $ 15 a pound .
well , those fell off the tree out back .
and around here , we don' t call them brazil nuts .
what do you call them ?
well , we' re in brazil ... ... so we just call them nuts .
fair enough .
what brings you to the amazon ... ... other than the food and drink , of course ?
i' m looking for a man .
what' s your type ?
his name' s travis walker .
brown hair .
he' s in his 20s .
wears a blue shirt , jeans .
right now he' s got a real bewildered look on his face .
do i know you ?
name' s beck .
what can i do for you ?
i need you to make a choice for me .
a choice ?
option a or option b.
what' s option a ?
option a is , you and i walk out of here nice and easy ... ... and drive back to the airstrip .
and then we begin our long journey back to los angeles .
there' il be no blood , no broken bones ... ... and no problems .
what' s in los angeles ?
your father .
what' s option b ?
pretty much the opposite of a.
but i wouldn' t recommend that one .
i' il take option c.
travis , there is no option c.
really ?
are you sure ?
i mean , big boy , there' s always an option c.
so angry !
shut up .
shut up !
like i said , there is no option c.
let me introduce you to option c.
mr. beck ...
... there' s been a slight change in the narrative .
an unexpected twist , you might say .
can i have a beer , please ?
mr. hatcher , i was just gonna come find you when this ...
the kid stays .
i paid you .
well , fortunately ... ... i had my fingers crossed the whole time .
apparently , young mr. walker ... ... may have stumbled onto a trinket of value .
and as he' s located it in my jungle ... ... i' m gonna need him to lead me to it .
okay , so let' s go , dickhead .
don' t call me a dickhead , you dickhead .
did you find it or not , asshole ?
what , asshole ?
did you find it or not ?
what' s that ?
did you find it or not , asshole ?
don' t !
hey , don' t rock the boat .
okay .
i don' t want any trouble .
leave now .
don' t come back .
and the 10, 000 ?
consider it tax deductible .
a contribution to your personal health fund .
with all due respect , mr. hatcher ... ... i' m feeling pretty healthy .
oh , yeah ?
walk .
don' t make waves .
you' re gonna kill us all , mr. beck ?
i tried to be reasonable .
that' s not the way to do business .
you should' ve kept the gun .
you' re dead already .
you just don' t know it yet .
this is option b ?
are you kidding me ?
this is option b ?
are you kidding me ?
quiet .
you' re dead .
you' re so dead .
we won' t get out of here .
all this land , hatcher owns it .
the road , the air , hatcher owns it all .
shut up .
whatever my dad is paying you ... ... i will double it .
no .
i' il quadruple it .
no .
double it and quadruple it .
no .
you' re being unreasonable !
i' il give you a chance to reconsider .
you get one more chance to shut up .
is that your final answer ?
for what it' s worth , i hope you enjoy the fall .
yeah , what fall ?
this fall .
come on , big boy , where' s the frigging keys ?
all right .
travis ?
good god !
travis !
i' m not going back .
oh , you' re going back .
no way .
right now .
who the hell do you think you are ?
you come into my town , mess up my bar ... ... and you eyeball my woman ?
eyeball your woman ?
it' s on .
what' s this ?
who is this ?
is he your friend ?
do you know him ?
do you ?
say hello .
say hello .
say hello .
are you finished ?
let' s go .
big boy , you like thunderstorms ?
bet you do , right ?
little thunder ?
stop it .
little lightning ?
stop !
thunder ?
lightning ?
thunder ?
lightning ?
ears ...
you done beating me up ?
let' s go .
i' m tired of this .
you win .
come on !
go to sleep .
go to sleep .
night night .
night night .
go to sleep now !
come on !
obviously , we got off on the wrong foot here .
so i' m gonna be completely candid with you .
have you ever heard of the gato do diabo ?
the devil' s cat ?
you' re gonna stop speaking now .
all right .
it' s ...
it' s a priceless object , man .
forged out of pure gold .
worth millions .
you said priceless .
you do not want to argue semantics with a ph. d. candidate .
ph. d. ?
yeah .
i am really very close to being dr. travis walker .
you dropped out of stanford after two semesters , einstein .
so i' m fairly close .
closer than you .
close to getting your ass kicked again .
wait , wait , wait !
the gato is real , all right ?
i know where to find it .
i' il split it with you , 80 20 .
move !
70 30 ?
you' re a very unpleasant individual , you know that ?
you think they' re dead ?
what am i , psychic ?
i' m gonna cut that kid' s nose off .
no , harvey .
you want the gato because if the bad guys get it ... ... they won' t need us anymore .
there' il be no one to work the mine .
you want to work the mine ?
there are two men in that jungle who are trying to steal from me .
i feel like a little boy who' s lost his first tooth ... ... put it under his pillow , waiting for the tooth fairy to come .
only , two evil burglars have crept in my window ... ... and snatched it before she could get here .
wait a second .
do you understand the concept of the tooth fairy ?
explain it to them .
you find a tooth , you put it under your pillow .
the fairy comes ... ... waiting for the tooth .
wait .
she takes the goddamn thing , gives you a quarter !
they got my tooth !
i want it back .
i have to ask you , back at the bar , man .
that was crazy !
no guns .
strip , toss , toss , strip .
didn' t i tell you to be quiet ?
i know , but what is that ?
some kind of nouveau samurai code ?
you got a problem with guns ?
they take me to a place i don' t wanna go .
where do they take you ?
to a place you don' t wanna see me go .
walk !
how often do you work out ?
let me get this straight ,
you never use guns ?
no .
never ?
never .
what if your best friend was gonna die ?
no guns .
santa would do it to save his best friend .
do i look like santa claus ?
do i look like santa claus to you ?
what is it ?
guns make you um pouco louco ?
bang bang crazy ?
i pick up guns , bad things happen .
i don' t like that .
what kind of things ?
very bad things , travis .
walk .
what about knives ?
move !
my father doesn' t share the same distaste .
he' s your father .
he won' t kill you .
all he cares about ... ... is what' s good for business .
now , the question is , mr. beck ... ... what' s good for your business ?
you don' t like money ?
i don' t make deals with people like you .
you don' t even know me .
you' re like every jackass i take down .
first they try to run , then fight , then they try to negotiate .
when that fails , they do what you' re about to do when you realize it' s over .
oh , yeah ?
what' s that ?
you' re gonna get down on your hands and knees and beg me for a break .
well , guess what .
i don' t give breaks .
no breaks .
you don' t understand the situation .
you borrowed money from the wrong guy .
you slept with the wrong guy' s wife .
i don' t care .
your mistake .
what about you , mr. beck ?
haven' t you ever made a mistake ?
i know !
move .
no breaks .
that' s lame .
no breaks !
no , i don' t give breaks .
santa claus doesn' t give any breaks .
should' ve been at the airstrip by now .
like i' m gonna help .
i didn' t ask for your help .
what are you doing ?
i have to pee .
pee in your pants .
move .
no .
i' ve let you push me around this jungle for , like , five hours .
you' ve been very aggressive , and i' m not moving until you let me pee .
if you wanna keep going , you' il have to carry me .
i' il pee on your head .
you threatening me ?
you threatening me with pee ?
well , yeah , if you don' t let me pee here .

no , i won' t .
you wanna pee , you got 30 seconds .

god bless you !
say hi .
hi .
these are your friends , huh ?
what , are you kidding me ?
i' m starting to long for a monkey with a hard on .
whatever happens , just keep looking into his eyes .
won' t that offend him ?
no .
whatever you do , do not blink .
they' re like grizzlies .
just shut up and let me take care of this .
we know you work for hatcher .
were you tracking us ? !
he thinks we work for hatcher .
well , tell him the truth .
fierce gaze .
fierce gaze .
fierce gaze .
honorable host , unlike this man on my left , i do not work for that evil scum .
why does the giant stare at me without respect ?
i will cut out his arrogant eyes !
what' s he saying ?
shut up .
just hold his gaze .
he is hatcher' s assassin .
paid to hunt all who oppose him , including me .
why do i get the feeling you really suck at portuguese ?
what did he say ? !
he says he pisses on your ancestors ... ... and that you would make a very pretty bride !
what' s going on ?
he wants to fight you .
no .
we' re not fighting .
tell him i don' t want to fight .
the assassin is a great warrior !
better to shoot him now and get it over with !
we are not fighting .
don' t worry , they' re little people .
what ?
you could take them .
they' re little .
you can win .
why do you want to fight ?
why ?
i just want to get back to the airport .
please .
i just have to get home .
okay , hip hop .
i don' t want to do this .
please .

travis , tell them one more time i do not want to fight .
i' d love to help you out , buddy , but i don' t think ... ... they' re really listening to me anymore .
heads up .
that' s okay !
that is okay !
hey , kansas cities !
don' t do it .
what is that ?
it' s like spinning tarzan jujitsu !
speedy little bastards , aren' t they ?
head' s gotta stay up .
i am not your enemy .
mariana ?
what are you doing here ?
barmaid by day , rebel leader by night .
you are good !
the whole time i was working you , you were working me .
i was hoping you might find o gato do diabo .

could it ?
man , that was some good work .
what do you think , travis ?
i knew .
you know that , right ?
i totally knew .
of course .
hey .
the herbs will keep it from getting infected .
why do you do this ?
pardon me ?
why do you fight ?
because of 65 cents an hour .
that' s what hatcher pays the workers .
but in order to mine , you need tools .
you need food , clothing , a place to sleep .
you have no money , so , what do you do ?
you borrow from hatcher .
pick and shovel , a dollar a day .
a sack to haul the dirt , another dollar .
old mr. beck knows a lot about debt , don' t you ?
he knows what it' s like to dig a hole so deep you can' t climb out .
call it what you want .

slavery .
and we intend to stop it .
manito wants to know who would win a fight between tyson and ali .

rumble .
rumble in the jungle ,

right to the head .
down goes tyson .

float like butterfly , sting like a bee !
yeah !
float like butterfly , sting like a bee !
he says he thinks you are a great fighter ... ... and he wants you to have it .
it' s for luck .
tell him i' m sorry , i can' t .
you' il offend him if you refuse .
i' m honored .
thank you .
you' il need all the luck you can get .
it' s a long walk back to the airfield .
especially by yourself .
nice !
you don' t understand .
i' m not going back without him .
oh , here we go again .
fifty rifles say you are .
and we' re rebels , not thieves .
hatcher !
travis !
let' s clean it up .
not so fast , jungle boy .
move !
move !
come on !
manito !
go , go , go !
manito !
let' s go !
i want hunting parties .
small ones .
find them .
find them !
all right , this is the way it' s going to be .
you' re going to take me to o gato do diabo .
and you' re going to take me now .
calm down .
don' t !
you saw what they do .
don' t ever tell me to calm down .
travis , don' t play with me .
or what ?
or i' m going to shoot you .
well , if you shoot me , you' re never gonna find the gato .
so we' re gonna make a little deal .
deal ?
you see ?
o gato is an object to you .
it' s life on the riviera , a private yacht .
you don' t know anything about me .
for us it' s hope .
my heart' s breaking .
it' s like a telethon .
you selfish ...
enough !
sit down !
sit down !
holy shit , you tried to shoot me !
you saw it !
crazy .
shut up .
shut up .
the deal' s this .
he takes you to the gato .
you just show me how i get out of this jungle so i can take him home .
deal ?
do we have a deal ?
deal .
let me get this straight .
she gets what she needs , you get what you need ... ... and i get the shaft .
i could always give her back the gun .
i really don' t like you .
yeah , well , i get that a lot .
seriously .
what ?
i was just wondering how it is you came to do ... ... you know , whatever it is you do .
it' s a long story .
it' s a long walk .
i grew up in a very rough place .
one thing led to another , that' s all .
just like you .
like me ?
yeah , you get pushed , you push back .
well , with me , i pushed so hard that word got around .
before i knew it , i was in a room full of the wrong people ... ... with the wrong money .
so you think i' m standing in a room full of the wrong people ?
yeah .
something like that .
i like you , mr. beck .
really .
but you and i are nothing alike .
travis !
let' s keep moving .
let' s go .
what are you doing ?
let' s take us a little swim , wolfgang .
we' re not swimming .
let' s go .
come on , big boy .
you could use a bath .
travis , we have to keep moving .
it' il be dark soon .
why ?
we' re already here .
don' t pee in the water .
why ?
a candiru , a vicious parasite , will swim up the urine into your pau .
come on , big boy !
it feels good !
swim up my what ?
your pinto .
it' il swim up your ding dong .
and once it gets in , you can' t get it out .
come on !
wait .
well , then what ?
they have to amputate .
not this boy' s pinto , not today .
the hieroglyphic code ... ... said the great chief of the maraj people put the gato to sleep ... ... behind walls of a moving curtain .
a waterfall .
must be some kind of methane buildup .
it' s cool .
let' s go .
oh , god !
yeah , real genius .
you have no clue what you' re doing .
oh , shut up !
you obviously don' t know anything about methane deposits .
oh , and you do ?
shut up .
what' d you just say ?
what is it ?
why do i get the feeling we are not supposed to be here ?
because we' re not .
there it is !
i told you it was real !
travis , you' re never gonna get back there .
it' s too dangerous .
the roof is coming down !
wait a second .
a jaguar .
i know what this is .
monkey .
eagle .
i can' t hold this , travis .
i know what this is .
what is it ?
it' s an 800 year old safe .
this is how they kept their treasures protected .
there' s a combination .
jaguar , cat .
gato , cat .
it' s gotta be the jaguar .
we pull the sticks closest to the jaguar , we' il be okay .
for 60 seconds , then the roof' s coming down .
you' re not gonna touch anything .
let' s go !
all right .
follow the jag .
follow the jaguar .
easy .
easy .
it' s coming down , travis .
what are you doing ?
let' s go !
pass it to me .
is that a jaguar ?
i think it' s an eagle !
travis , hurry !
oh , my ...
here , kitty , kitty , kitty .
i did it .
i found you .
not some oxford archaeologist or some stiff ass harvard professor .
i did it !
i found you !
who gives a shit ?
how you like me now , huh , beck ?
go !
go !
move !
now !
run !
let' s go !
move !
these are konlabos .
they' re very rare .
you' re lucky .
and i wouldn' t flirt with o gato do diabo' s eyes if i were you .
they say it' s dangerous .
what else do they say ?
once restored to its rightful owners , the rivers will be laden with fish .
and the trees will grow tall , bringing shade for hammocks ... ... so its people may rest their backs .
you think bringing this gato will do all that ?
no , mr. beck .
but i expect the money selling it brings will do just that .
we can buy seed , irrigate .
farm our own lands .
free ourselves from hatcher' s mine .
when that statue hits the black market , it' il vanish forever .
it' s a little late for morals .
especially after you were going to do the same thing .
and 10 percent of that is going to pay for your freedom ... ... so i' d be a little more grateful if i were you .
what if i told you i was gonna give it to a museum ... ... so the whole world could appreciate it ?
you can tell me anything you want , travis , but i know you .
what are you going to do after you bring him home ?
i' m gonna open a restaurant .
yeah .
he' s a killer in the kitchen too .
ten , 15 tables .
nothing fancy .
italian .
southern italian .
how do you ... ?
how do you ... ?
how do you spell ... ,,, konlabos ?
konlabos , with a k.
don' t worry .
after four or five hours , you' il be as good as new .
the fire will keep the animals away until sunup .
i' m sorry ... ... but money has a way of changing people .
you did find it , travis .
just like you said .
no one can take that away from you .
and i will send you the money ... ... buy your freedom .
i meant that .
you kept your word , and i admire that ... ... so i' il keep mine .
go north until you reach the quantana road .
take it south all the way to the airfield .
good luck to you , mr. beck .
oh , shit .
what ?
what ?
what ?
monkey .
monkey .
monkey ?
where ?
just get him away from me .
get out of here .
get out of here .
get out of here , monkey !
oh , no .
i hate this place .
get out of here !
i hate penis eating minnows , and i hate freaky fruit .
get them away from me .
i wanna go home .
i want concrete .
get out of here , monkey .
i want homemade tortellini .
i want my los angeles lakers .
that' s what i want .
i want to go home .
i want to go home .
i want to go home !
get out of here , monkey .
get out of here , monkey .
well , what about that ?
been for a stroll , have you , boys ?
where' s my bag ?
where' s my jeep ?
give me my bag .
you have any water ?
sit down .
how soon before we can take off ?
you left a jeep at the bottom of a mountainside .
i' il take care of it .
in a bloody large puddle .
i said , i' il take care of it .
that jeep is dead , my friend .
look , you' il get your money .
just start the plane .
what' s your big hurry ?
i' m trying to leave before i run into hatcher or more problems .
don' t go worrying about hatcher .
that monstrosity won' t give a flying fornication ... ... for the pair of youse no more .
he got what he was after .
what do you mean ?
he caught up with poor mariana in the jungle .
he relieved her of her artifact .
what' d you say ?
i said , he relieved her of her artifact .
it' s a word in the english language .
artifact . " look it up .
son of a bitch .
he' s got my gato !
your what ?
the gato .
don' t you speak english ?
hey .
where is she ?
hatcher' s got her in town .
he' s torturing her for information .
he' s doing what ?
freedom fighters ?
freedom fighters , my ass .
lutadores de louco , you ask me .
they' re all gonna die .
come on .
all aboard .
come on .
what are you doing ?
we made a deal .
a deal ?
what the hell does that mean ?
i' m here at the airstrip , she doesn' t have the gato .
gonna go in there by yourself ?
no way .
no way .
hey , hatcher' s got a small army back there .
you don' t know your way around the town .
oh , wait .
i got an idea .
saddle up to one of those bulls ... ... ride into town like a conquistador and challenge all of them to a duel .
oh , yeah .
i forgot .
you don' t use guns .
what' s your point ?
you' re gonna die , beck .
the boy' s right .
you mind if we settle the bill now ?
you need help .
are you gonna help me , travis ?
all you care about is the money .
no , beck , you' re wrong .
i' d rather die than let that son of a bitch get my gato .
you need all the help you can get .
you can even use him , for chrissake .
don' t bring me into it .
i got a dodgy knee here .
you can' t do this on your own .
okay , travis .
i know you' re gonna run on me .
might not be tonight or tomorrow .
but i will find you , and i will take you back .
are we clear ?
yeah .
we' il both probably be dead in about an hour .
so let' s cancel christmas .
your plan of attack was a bit naive .
man , if i was only 10 minutes younger , huh ?
i suppose now we have a conversation where you enlighten me .
mr. hatcher .
how many more of you are out there ?
enlighten me .
where are the rest of your compadres ?
enlighten me !
mr. hatcher .
i don' t get why you people are so hostile .
i' ve been good to you .
i built you a town .
why are we fighting ?
mr. hatcher .
what ?
we' ve lost contact with outpost 1 .
there' s nobody answering .
mr , hatcher , are you out there ?
what can i do for you , mr. beck ?
i have no desire to fight with you or your men ,
for that reason , you have two options ,
option a , you leave the gato and the girl ,,, ,,, and you walk out of town , no questions asked ,
what' s option b ?
option b ,,, ,,, i make you ,
wrong choice ,
lock down the town .
still no visual contact , team two is checking the perimeter right now ,
he ... ... that heard the sound of thy holy trumpet ... ... and took not warning ... ... he hath clearly wandered too far ... ... from the word of god .
and cornelius bernard hatcher ... ,,, your heir has come , let' s get it on , big boy !
it' s time to get back on the path .
that' s a lot of cows .
hi .
what nerve .
about bloody time , huh ?
somebody just shoot him .
oh , yeah ?
oh , you want one ?
oh , okay .
a little thunder ?
huh ?
you like thunderstorms , big boy ?
how about some lightning ?
ear , ear ...
ears , eyes , foot , face !
take the gato and the girl and get to the airfield .
if you run into trouble , use her as a hostage .
and harvey , when you' re safely out of town ... ... put her out of my misery .
i need help !
do not go gentle into that good night , my lovely .
beck !
i need help .
beck !
rage , rage ... ... against the dying of the light .
there shall be no mercy ...
... for any force that stands ...
... blocking this path of his righteousness .
beck , help !
help !
move !
no way .
give me back my gato , you little bald freak !
oh , great .
see you .
you got the moves .
i' il give you that .
you reached into the wrong refrigerator , mr. beck .
hold your horses .
what have i done ?
are we not men ?
hatcher .
what ?
option a is still on the table .
you can walk away right now .
option a doesn' t work for me .
before i came here , what did you people have ?
face it .
be fair .
i put a roof over your head , coin in your pockets .
you barefoot indians didn' t have pockets ... ... before hatcher came along .
i gave you a life !
i' m the heart in the darkness .
face it ... ... you can' t run this thing without me .
i am pumping the blood of the modern world ... ... into your backward veins ... ... you stinking ... ... ingrate ... ... oompa loompa ... ... morons !
okay .
that' s it , i' m done .
mr. beck ... ... i' il take option a.
clear , please .
oh , shit .
you make a hell of an entrance , mr. beck .
yeah .
i' d offer you a beer , but i think you blew up my bar .
yeah , i think you' re right .
thank you .
we had a deal .
yes , we did .
and i' m afraid i didn' t deliver on that deal .
how is that ?
the gato .
i promised you the gato .
yes , well , i promised you travis .
you all talking about this travis ?
and this gato ?
i' m impressed .
yeah , well , make sure they spell my name right .
i told you it wasn' t about the money .
well , big boy ... ... i guess it' s your move .
i' m impressed myself , travis .
declan , start the plane .
declan , start the plane " ?
what does that mean ?
i' m taking you home .
oh , i figured that .
no breaks .
good luck .
you too .
i will send you your cut .
move .
not a penny less than 15 . 6 million .
move , travis .
you really ought to stay away from guns .
you ought to get yourself a psychiatrist .
seriously .
move .
well , look at him .
look at you .
your beard .
you' re like a real man .
but you' re so thin .
running is good exercise .
good exercise .
that' s funny .
did you hear him ?
running for your life .
i love it .
i really do !
you know there' s not enough aspirin in the world ... ... for a headache like you ?
well , there probably is .
but i understand what you mean .
well , that' s good .
because that means you' il understand why you' il take that trip to chicago .
actually , i don' t completely understand that one .
still the smart ass .
i' m not that smart , dad .
i didn' t know she was married .
well , she was .
very married .
and you .
what took you so long , huh ?
your kid was a tough rundown , billy .
him ?
no .
yeah , yeah .
but i did walk him right through that door , right ?
like we agreed ?
you did .
we good ?
we' re good .
two hundred and fifty large .
you got your restaurant , kid .
now get out of here , huh ?
before i leave ...
when i was in brazil , they showed me this ritual they do ... ... when they have big celebrations .
what they do is , they eat this fruit , and it' s called konlabos , with a k.
so i figured before i leave , we could celebrate one last time .
come on , guys .
try some of this .
if he says it' s good , it' s gotta be .
he' s the best chef i know .
billy , here , you try the first piece .
not bad .
big seeds , though .
i don' t like seeds .
hey , what are you ... ?
i walked him right through that door , billy .
boy ... ... you got a funny iooking face .
hey , dad .
i love you , you know that ?
i love you , you know that ?
because you showed me something back there .
i thought you had character , but i wasn' t sure .
you got it , man .
you really got it !
get in the truck .
you violated every agricultural law .
that' s the least of my problems .
we should go back in there and finish him off .
you want to go back , go ahead .
knock yourself out .
i' il wait for you .
i' m not going back .
right .
so shut up , get in the truck before i change my mind .
don' t push me .
what ?
don' t push me .
i appreciate everything you did .
if you want to get technical , all you did is even the score .
i saved you first .
get in .
you don' t have to thank me .
but this pushing shit ain' t happening no more .
you read me ?
okay .
i' m gonna bust you up .
go for it .
yeah .
hey , remember your friend mr. thunder ?
how about his buddy mr. lightning ?
i know you know him .
you know him real well , don' t you ?
i' m just playing , man .
i' il be in the truck .
i' m gonna kill you .
