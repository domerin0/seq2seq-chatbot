fellas , we' re closed .
this is the guy , carlos .
hi .
i don' t think i owe this money .
really ?
and why do you say that , mr. delaney ?
i didn' t roll the dice .
a lady threw the dice .
i don' t even know her name .
so this is all just like a big misunderstanding .
well , luckily , we have tape .
ah , see ?
tha\ x9ds us .
losers .
more losers .
for about $9 . 95 in the room , you can watch that .
shame we had to leave that .
a reason to bring back instant replay .
i' ve said that for years .
that has got to hurt you .
was that tricia ?
the woman you were with at the bar was handling the dice for luck .
you gave them to her , she threw them on the table .
that , mr. delaney , is a roll in any casino in town .
now , i' m sorry .
but you owe us 51, 000 dollars .
51, 000 dollars ?
plus the minibar .
can we see that tape ?
i don' t have 51, 000 dollars .
i' m a cartoonist .
i do background color for sunday' s " garfield " .
we' re dangerous , quasi criminal , take no shit vegas types .
so , what does that mean ?
what are you going to do ?
hurt me ?
i got into this business to make easy money and ... ... the damn thing is , they hook you in and ... ... then you find yourself doing things you don' t really want to be doing ... ... like killing people like you .
and then you start to enjoy it , which is a problem .
i' m kidding .
making a light remark , though probably not to you .
point is , i will hang you ... ... cut your balls off and put them in your pocket .
but not without a lot of jewish guilt .
you owe me , in one month , 51, 000 dollars .
and starting now , i will need a daily security deposit .
i think i\ x9ds important if we go back to that tape with the ladies .
but cheer up .
i am going to comp the minibar .
what happened ?
i' m screwed , tha\ x9ds what happened .
all right , where are you ?
i just lost 51, 000 dollars .
if i don' t get it in a month , i' m buzzard feed .
they' il kill me .
jesus .
i wish we could give you the money ... ... but we put our cash into the house .
and we' ve borrowed against it to set up steve' s practice ... ... which explains why the wedding of my dreams cost $280 .
what are you doing ?
have you seen my flip flops ?
you know anybody who' il loan you the money ?
no , baby , listen .
if you want us to stop seeing other people , what the hell ?
le\ x9ds try it .
it might help us reach a deeper level of togetherness ... ... and you know , bring us closer together .
yeah .
okay .
sure .
yeah , me too .
all right , kiss kiss .
okay , bye .
your sister is driving me nuts .
okay , we' re here .
what you' re going to go for is a nice , smooth stroke .

there will definitely be a house and a ring involved .
maybe even children .
children ?
tha\ x9dil depend on how far you and this other guy will want to take it .
but , yeah .
i' d say kids would be involved .
at least a dog .
children , a dog and another guy .
you' re allergic to dogs .
how about cats ?
maybe a hamster ?
maybe a hamster .
baby , i got exactly what you need .
le\ x9ds go .

you' re under arrest , you sick fuck .
i wasn' t soliciting prostitution .

you know what they do to pedophiles in the joint ?
not to mention hamster fuckers .
i wasn' t looking for a hooker or a hamster !
i was looking for you .
i was looking for natalie parker .
how do you know her name ?
we were at a wedding once , a long time ago .
and you hooked up with a friend of mine , kyle brenner .
doesn' t ring any bells .
what do you want with her ?
i\ x9ds stupid .
it was a bad idea .
can i please just apologize and go ?
i want to hear it .
i go to vegas .
there' s this redhead .
i play craps .
i lose all my money .

i' m in a lot of trouble .
some buddies of mine and i have a bet .
last bachelor standing wins .
the pot is huge .
half a million .
and i need this money .
i mean , i really need this money .
i just thought ...
i\ x9ds stupid , but ...
what ?
you thought what ?
i just thought that ...
kyle talks about you like you were the one that got away .
like you were his last chance at true love .
i just thought that getting the two of you together ... ... something would rekindle .
you guys would get married and i' d win the money .
everybody wins .
that was the most pathetic fucking shit i have ever heard .
that hamster story was better than that crap .
what made you think i' d agree to it ?
i don' t even remember this guy karl .
kyle .
whatever .
kyle brenner .
you' re right .
i' m sorry .
it was stupid .
i' m sorry .
i\ x9ds your call , detective .

i was wondering if i could increase my limit to ... ... i don' t know , 51, 000 dollars .
yes , yes , i know .
carlos did ?
no .
i have no intentions of cutting up my card .
no , do not send someone over to do it for me !
this carlos runs a very tight ship .
coming .
let me just throw something on .
okay .
one more sec .
who is it ?
i' ve done some checking .
kyle' s rich .
why don' t you ask him for a loan ?

here .
pour this .
patrn .
classy .
what are you wearing ?
i was on hold for a very long ...
anyway , i don' t really feel the need to dress up for these repo guys .
i' ve thought about your idea .
i want to do it .
but we split the bet money 50 50 .
sure .
yeah .
this is great .
this is terrific .
actually ... ... there is one little problem .
you kind of have to marry kyle ... ... within 30 days .
no problem .
i want to do to kyle what he did to me .
what do you mean ?
you do remember kyle ?
of course i do .
we hooked up at max' s wedding .
that little shit told me everything i wanted to hear ... ... and then abandoned me on the pch ... ... with nothing more than a roll of quarters to call a cab .
nice memory for a girl' s first time ?
i was kind of hoping for " love will prevail , " but you know what ?
hate will do just fine .
sorry !
sorry about that .
the first thing we have to do is get to know our prey .
precisely what kind of girls he likes .
be careful .
this is expensive .
i' m sorry .

i have always loved books .
and so i started studying library science at luther college and ...
oh , i' m sorry .
i' ve been going on and on and on about myself all night .
oh , this is so embarrassing .
i\ x9ds such a treat when you meet a woman who' s so honest and direct .
you' re making me blush .
you' re sweet .
golly , stop it .

it was nice to meet you , jill .

you said it .
we' re on the same wavelength .
ah .
yea .
all that ...
all that wavelength stuff , to be frankly honest with you ... ... i was just saing that to get you into bed .
that is not very nice .
in fact , that is downright naughty .
i' ve been a bad boy .
i' ve been very bad .
i' m sorry .
i think i should go home and think about what i' ve done .
tha\ x9ds right .
you should think long and hard about what you did .
you naughty boy .

you piece of slime .

okay !
look at the time .
i\ x9ds getting late .
i should be heading home .

i know you' d probably love to have me hang around so you can ... ... beat the ever living shit out of me !
i really should go home please let me go home .
please , can i go home ?
i know about boys like you .
you don' t take books seriously .
yes , i do .
i take books very seriously .
meow .
so you don' t respect books .
i love books .
you break their bindings .
you doodle in their margins .
tha\ x9ds right .
you are a doodlebug .
i' m not a doodlebug .
tha\ x9ds what you are .
just a little , dirty bug .
the scarlet letter .
great inspiration in those pages .
i\ x9ds an excellent choice .
one whack for every day overdue .
i don' t know .
i' m just not feeling it .
something' s missing .
here' s grammy !
tha\ x9ds it .
no more redheads .
no more redheads , ever .
god !
you really like this girl ?
natalie ?
man , i' m telling you .
she' s the best .
isn' t it time you moved on ?
no way , dude .
this girl really knows how to turn me on .
you find anything down there ?
feel my left nut .
are you out of your mind ?
no , no , man .
i\ x9ds like the size of a baseball .
good for you .
i' m not touching it .
this other one' s fine .
but this one feels like a cantaloupe or something .
must be those blue balls you mentioned .
feel it .
tell me what you think .
i think i' m about to kick your ass !
come on .
dude .
mike .
mike , come on !
a real pal' d feel my balls .
we were showering .
and i looked down ... ... and my left nut is the size of an easter egg .
what do you want me to do about it ?
i want your professional opinion .
you want me to grope your balls ?
just the left one .
mike wouldn' t do it .
come on , you' re a doctor .
feel his balls .
i' m a proctologist , not a urologist .
you' il jam your fingers up his ass but won' t touch his balls ?
they' re two different things !
you went to medical school .
all right !
slow down !
slow down !
i' il do it .
thanks .
i need my nurse present .
shirley , have my nurse come in here , please ?
she' s in room 12 with your wife .
they' ve been back there for about a half an hour , at least .
ah , shitballs !
harder .
do it harder .
i finally caught you , you dirty ...
steve , you finish that sentence , and i swear to god i' il call a lawyer .
we better go with two on this one .
jesus .
this is huge .
like a kumquat .
what does it mean ?
beats me .
i won' t beat around the dance floor , mr. brenner .
i\ x9ds cancer .
oh , jesus .
i\ x9ds only in the one testicle .
we' il run more tests after we remove it .
you mean , remove the cancer ?
no , mr. brenner .
i mean , remove the testicle .
if i don' t remove it , you could die .
how painful a death are we talking about ?
let me give it to you straight .
the affected region is too close to the spine to give you any anesthesia .
so we plan to make a gash in the abdomen .
reach down , yank the scrotum up into the abdominal cavity ... ... and saw off the testicle .
there' s a 40 percent chance ... ... we' re going to have to amputate the penis .
oh , god !
had you going .
that is why i love this job .
i\ x9ds painless .
the procedure takes about an hour .
okay .
so will i still be able to ... ?
you know ?
play the trombone ?
no , i mean , with girls .
will i ... ?
can i still ... ?
oh , ride the one eyed hoagie .
of course you can , son .
however , i recommend to most of my patients before this procedure ... ... that they make a deposit in the sperm bank ... ... before the operation , just in case .
just go on over , you know ... ... give her a whack .
i don' t want to do this .
i' m not asking you to go in the room with me .
if you do it too , i' il be more comfortable .
i mean , look at this place .
i\ x9ds completely professional , right ?
we' re here to make a deposit .
i really don' t want to do this .
sign these forms .
and fill these bottles .
so if i run into trouble back there ... ... you' il give me a hand ?
never heard that one before .
you' re in room seven , and you' re in room nine .
come on .
oh , michael , you' re the greatest .
here you go .
dude .
dude !
i brought you a plant .
oh , dude .
don' t make me laugh .
has natalie been here all night ?
she never left my side .
she says this happened because i' ve got too much karma in my genitals .
how was it ?
it was all right .
doc says the other rocket launcher' s good , so ...
come here .
come here .
come here .
i want my ball .
kyle , i understand that , but look on the bright side .
you still have one healthy one .
you don' t understand .
i want to take it home with me , and the nurses said i can' t do that .
i\ x9ds not a tooth , kyle .
it belongs to me .
i miss it .
please .
get my nut .
it fell right on the floor .
what ?
the kidney ?
slipped from my hand , how embarrassing .
mertle kicks it , it rolls under the o. r. table ... ... slides across the room .
i can' t believe i' m doing this .
okay , come on .
come to papa .
slippery little guy .
got you .
i got to put this in something .
got to find something to put this in .
where' d it go ?
where' d you go ?
where' d you ... ... go ?
you can' t be in here .
hold the sticky buns .
give me these .
stand in line .
give them to me .
you have to ... ... stand ... ... in ... ... line !
doctor !
do not eat that !
did you get it ?
yep .
i got it .
wow .
so tha\ x9ds what a nut looks like ?
tha\ x9ds a nut .
thanks , mike .
you' re a lifesaver .
i appreciate it .
remember our deal , banging every girl in the world ?
tha\ x9ds on you now , pal .
i' il get right on that .
call me .
don' t get too comfortable .
you have got to wait your turn .
hurry up , michael , i' m next .
give me a couple of minutes of rest .
kyle doesn' t take this long .
two , three minutes and he' s always done .
hurry if you want to get every woman in the world .
please , let me shut my eyes , for like , literally 30 seconds ... ... and then just a little sandwich .
michael .
i\ x9ds carlos .
i know you got three days and 14 hours to go ... ... but since you' ve run out of shit for me to take ...
i remind you , if you don' t pay , you die .
no problem .
i' il have it .
you' re as bad a liar as you are a gambler , mr. delaney .
see you friday .

i' m just kidding , man .
i' m all better .
i' m fine .
i bring this everywhere i go .
thanks to you .
thanks for showing up today .
i really wanted you to be here .
here for what ?
you' re busted , mike .
natalie told me what you did .
she what ?
how you found her .
i can' t believe it .
kyle , i am so sorry .
you tracked her down after hearing my story to see if we' d fit .
who does that ?
thank you .
you' re the best , pal .
she tell you she' s a cop ?
that whole cosmetics counter thing ?
that was an undercover gig .
very clever .
thank you .
you know what ?
when death has literally got you by the balls ... ... everything you' ve been afraid of suddenly seems unimportant .
there are things that i can do now ... ... that i never could do before .
officer natalie parker ... ... i have been arrested by your beauty .
and i' d love to serve a life sentence ... ... in the jail of your heart .
oh , my god .
yes .
of course i' il marry you , kyle .
i can' t believe it .
i' ve delivered natalie right into the devil' s lair .
i finally feel i can have something real with someone .
you know , something solid .
built on trust .
like what you and tricia have .
now she' s going to go off and marry him .
step up , man .
tell her how you feel .
tell her you love her , you puss .
have you been listening ?
she loves kyle .
steve , i\ x9ds so weird .
for the first time in my life ... ... someone else matters more to me than ... ... i matter to myself .
well , you changed after all that shit you went through .
i' m exercising .
people change .
you know what ?
maybe kyle has changed too .
all he went through .
maybe he' s a changed man now .
oh , yeah , baby !
all right !
ooh , give it to me .
i' il be right back , baby .
wha\ x9ds up , having fun ?
calm down !
how rocking is this ?
wha\ x9ds the matter ?
you' re not having a good time , buddy ?

come on , come on !
mike , did you see this ?

and she' s a student .
right now i' m concentrating on my actressing .

i\ x9ds my bachelor party .

oh , hello there !
you' re cool with this ?
everybody' s entitled to a last hurrah .
you want to go in the bedroom and start warming up without me ?
i' il be there in a minute .
thank you .
what do you mean , " last hurrah " ?
i just figure you' re getting married tomorrow morning at 9 : 00 a . m .
you know , you' re entitled one last dip in the bachelor pool .
you' re funny .
you' re hysterical , man .
you' re joking , right ?
i thought you loved her .
love' s got nothing to do with it .
natalie will be a great baby maker .
i could still sleep around .
she' il be at home with the kids .
she' il never know .
hey , girls !
wha\ x9ds up ?
i thought you were going to go warm up in bed without me .
you did it , man .
you won the bet , man !
you' il be rich .
tomorrow morning at 9 , you' re gonna be rich .
rich !
no , steve .
no , i' m not .
i have got a wedding to stop !
i cannot believe you let kyle plan this wedding .
it doesn' t matter .
you' re going through with this ?
hey .
look at me .
do i look amazing or what ?
we' re in luck .
my uncle murray' s performing the ceremonies .
he' s my hero .
and the witnesses sign in triplicate .
tha\ x9ds three , tres , trois ... ... and then ... ... i stamp a little , i notarize , i file it .
voil .

slow down !
that was close .
i can' t believe this .
i\ x9ds terrible .
sorry .
sorry .
i' m sorry .
fur coat !
what are you ... ?
stop it !
marriage is a state ... ... that is not entered into easily .
it is damn hard , kids .
it requires dedication and a lot of sacrifices .
like for instance , if you have a mother in law ... ... who figures she can stay over with you whenever she damn pleases !
she comes in and stays in the toilet for an hour and a half !
who reads warand peace in the toilet ? !
mommy !
i' m a good stranger .
i\ x9ds okay .
hey , you !
stop !
i' m not weird .
we were just talking .
kyle , do you promise to make love to natalie ... ... and only natalie ... ... until one of you is dead ?
i wasn' t looking at you .
don' t do that .
be advised , we' re looking for a peeping tom .
this guy is really twisted .
and do you , my handsome nephew ... ... take natalie to be your lawful wedded wife ... ... through the good times and the bad times ... ... and the times she won' t talk to you for months ... ... and even worse , when she will ... ... so you pretend you' re asleep so she' il leave you alone ... ... but you lie there listening to her grind her teeth ... ... hour after hour ... ... like a fucking hacksaw ?
i made it .
nice dress , bonehead !
sorry .
my mistake .
stop the wedding !
i love you !
i thought you said you were done with all that .
i\ x9ds not peter .
i don' t even know who this guy is .
i' m curious , mr. delaney .
how did you get the money ?
i guess you could say i sold my soul .
yeah , i see a lot of that .
way to go .
marry the best woman in the world and i\ x9ds not enough for you .
what ?
you' re married ? !
thanks , asshole .
you got something on your nose .
you were in on it together .
take me for a ride .
what do you mean ?
you got it all !
why' d you tap me on the nose ?
you really don' t know , do you ?
on our wedding night .
i thought everything was fine .
i was ready to give her hose down .
well , hello , mrs. brenner .
actually , i' m gonna keep my own name .
yeah , whatever .
yeah .
a little of the old bubbly .
remember our first time ?
when you left me out in malibu with nothing but a roll of quarters ?
yeah .
that was so hot .
here' s to that .
le\ x9ds swap bodily fluids , baby .
when i woke up , she was gone .
the next day , marriage was annulled , she was nowhere to be found .
never saw her again .
figured you two had a scam to get the bachelor cash .
tha\ x9ds cool , though .
i' m getting more pussy now than ever .
chicks really dig a guy with a broken heart .
kyle , i am so sorry .
i' m kidding .
i just play that .
you know me .
i' il be a one balled babe hound when i' m 80 .
i got a date with a new girl .
she' s fantastic .
what , another cosmetics counter girl ?
no , man , no .
a librarian .
she' s so hot .
a little redheaded girl .
she gave me this book to read .
this book will change your life .
i gotta go .
i like to be spanked with a day old carrot .
how much you got ?
twenty bucks .
and my own carrot .
excuse me .
i' ve got a proposal , but it might sound a little strange .
the chinese theater is this way ?
thank you very much , ma' am .
where' s the carrot ?
i got it .
i\ x9ds okay .
i got it .
i just wanted to give you this .
you were there ?
i tried to stop the wedding , but i was late .
so , this proposal ... ... does it involve sex ?
yeah , i' d say there' d be a fair amount of sex involved .
definitely a house and a ring .
maybe even some children .
children ?
at least a dog .
definitely not a hamster .
i like dogs .
so , wha\ x9ds up , delaney ?
you love me or something ?
i do .
i now happily ratify ... ... your union as husband and wife .
you may kiss your bride .
