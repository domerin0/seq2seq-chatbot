at the beginning of the 21st century , the umbrella corporation ... had become the largest commercial entity in the united states .
nine out of every ten homes contain its products .
its political and financial influence is felt everywhere .
in public , it is the world' s leading supplier ... of computer technology , medical products and health care .
unknown even to its own employees ... its massive profits are generated by military technology ... genetic experimentation and viral weaponry .
all umbrella staff must wear their identity tags at all times .
all radiation badges will be collected at 5 : 00 p . m . this afternoon .
thank you !
god !
some people .
yeah .
don' t show this to me .
why not ?
because i' m busy .
it' s nothing .
fire drill .
what is that ?
fire drill .
shit !
hey , what the hell is going on ?
get the computers covered !
move it !
damn it , i' m trying !
the experiments !
move them !
shouldn' t the doors open or something ?
it' s supposed to take us to the nearest floor .
what' s happening ?
line' s dead .
what' s the problem ?
the doors won' t open .
what about the ones at the back ?
locked as well .
there' s no fire here !
no fire !
the code doesn' t work !
no fire !
what' s wrong with you ?
the door won' t open !
and this water isn' t going anywhere .
what ?
it' s a sealed room .
help me with the door !
oh , fuck the doors !
we have to get out of here .
what' s going on ?
has this happened before ?
we have to get out of here .
we have to get out of here !
take it easy .
you take it easy !
quiet !
what is that ?
oh , my god .
halon !
stop it !
stop it !
stop !
help !
let me see .
we' re gonna have to get out of here .
we have to get out of this building !
here , give me a hand .
that' s as far as they' il go .
they' re caught on something .
that' s wide enough .
i can squeeze through .
i' il get help .
i' m stuck .
you' re gonna have to push .
that' s it .
a bit more .
what was that ?
oh , christ !
it' s the brakes !
get out !
i can' t move !
we have to get out of here !
push her out of the way !
pull me back inside !
pull me back inside !
hello ?
who are you ?
move !
don' t touch me !
stop !
get away from me !
down !
what are you doing ?
i' m a cop !
i told you , i' m a cop !
you' re breaking my arm !
report .
report now .
what ?
i want your report , soldier .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
sir , the house' s primary defenses have been activated .
she' s probably still suffering the side effects .
what are you doing with us ?
what about the cop ?
matthew addison .
i' m not getting a match .
who are you ?
i just transferred .
they probably don' t even have me on file yet .
the locals are inefficient .
it' s possible .
should i secure him here ?
no .
we take him with us .
you can' t do this !
blow me .
prep for entry to the hive .
power' s down .
so fix it .
i' m on it .
are you done yet ?
jumpy .
stand clear !
you got a problem ?
how' s that door ?
it' s sealed shut .
let me .
jumpy ?
lie still .
lie still !
watch this light .
follow it .
now , how many fingers am i holding up ?
three .
good .
now tell me your name .
i don' t know .
he' s fine .
memory loss , just like the other one .
let' s open that door .
listen to me .
i want to know who you people are ... and i want to know what' s going on here .
now !
you and i have the same employer .
we all work for the umbrella corporation .
the mansion above us is an emergency entrance to the hive .
you are security operatives placed there to protect that entrance .
what about this ?
your marriage is a fake .
just part of your cover to protect the secrecy of the hive .
and what is the hive ?
show them .
accessing schematic of the hive .
raccoon city , nearest urban center .
the mansion where we found you ... and through which we gained access to the train ... which , in turn , brought us to the hive .
the hive itself is located underground ... deep beneath the streets of raccoon city .
a top secret research facility ... owned and operated by the umbrella corporation ... the hive houses over 500 technicians , scientists and support staff .
they live and work underground .
their research is of the highest importance .
its nature is classified .
our position on the map is indicated by heat signature .
why can' t i remember anything ?
the hive has its own defense mechanisms ... all computer controlled .
a nerve gas was released into the house .
primary effect of the gas complete unconsciousness lasting anything up to four hours .
secondary effects are varied , but can include acute memory loss .
for how long ?
subjective .
an hour , day , week .
so you' re saying this place was attacked ?
i' m afraid things are a little more complicated than that .
sir !
we' ve breached the hive .
j. d.
got it .
halon content has dissipated .
makes it easier to work underground , thinking there' s a view .
looks like we' re taking the stairs .
status .
red queen is locked onto us .
she knows that we' re here .
who' s the red queen ?
state of the art artificial intelligence .
she is the computer that controls the hive .
this is gonna slow us down .
our route to the queen takes us straight through these labs .
rain , j. d. , see how bad the flooding is .
kaplan , find us an alternate route .
what happened here ?
five hours ago , red queen went homicidal .
sealed the hive and killed everyone down here .
jesus .
when we realized what was happening ... my team was dispatched to shut her down .
why did she do it ?
that we don' t know .
but outside interference is a possibility .
jesus !
hey .
you okay ?
here .
no .
i' m fine .
please , come on .
it' s cold in here .
are you
do you remember anything from before this ?
no .
nothing before the train .
and you ?
no .
nothing .
i found an alternate route , but it' s gonna cost us time .
we double back , cut through dining hall b ... then we' re right on track .
sir , no go .
the whole level' s flooded .
all right , we' re behind schedule .
so let' s move it .
come on .
poor bastards .
dining hall b.
that' s what it says on the map .
maybe you' re reading it wrong .
maybe the corporation' s keeping a few secrets down here .
something you' re not supposed to see .
j. d. , you and rain keep the prisoner here and secure the exit .
sir , halon levels are nonexistent in this room .
i think the system malfunctioned .
all right .
there may be survivors .
give me a search line , but keep it tight .
move it .
i said keep it tight .
sorry .
i' m not sure i want to remember what went on down here .
i don' t blame you .
what do they keep in these things ?
how do i know ?
what' s taking so long ?
red queen' s defenses are in place .
she' s making it difficult .
let' s pack it up .
you stay here .
the lights are automated .
nothing to worry about .
transmitter in position .
roger .
running the bypass .
checkmate .
move up .
what is that ?
that' s what will shut the queen down .
delivers a massive electrical charge .
scrambles the mainframe and forces it to reboot .
some kind of dormant defense mechanism .
opening the door tripped it .
put it back to sleep .
working on it .
would you open that door now , please ?
i' m trying .
hold your positions .
everyone stay calm .
what' s that ?
kaplan , quick !
we gotta get them out of there !
kaplan , you' ve gotta hurry !
come on !
down !
get down !
look out !
something' s killing them !
jesus !
come on , man .
don' t do this to me !
medic !
medic !
open the door !
open this door !
i am trying .
stay conscious .
you' re going into shock .
stay awake !
i am almost there .
sir !
it' s coming back !
open the door !
i' m trying !
well , try harder !
it' s coming back !
oh , god !
just do it !
i' m almost there .
come on !
shit !
got it .
all right .
let' s do it .
do what ?
we have to complete the mission .
there is no way i' m going down there .
her defenses are down .
dj vu , anyone ?
keep going .
give me a hand .
get out !
get out !
you can' t be in here .
don' t listen to anything she says .
she' s a holographic representation of the red queen .
you have to get out !
modeled after the head programmer' s daughter .
she' il try to deceive us , confuse us .
i wouldn' t advise this .
disabling me will result in loss of primary power .
she' il say anything to stop us from shutting her down .
i implore you .
implore away .
please ?
please ?
you' re all going to die down here .
that pulse forces the circuit breaker to shut down her mainframe for 30 seconds .
after that , if i don' t have her board , she can reboot .
they' re late .
i' m on it .
j. d. , we got a survivor !
it' s okay .
we' re here to help .
you seem to be in some serious
get off of me !
get off of me !
j. d. , get her off of me before i stab her ass !
are you okay ?
she bit me , man .
she took a chunk clean right out of me .
stay down .
i' m warning you , stay down !
she' s crazy .
come any closer , and i' il fire .
i mean it !
damn you .
i shot her five times .
how was she still standing ?
bitch isn' t standing now .
what was all the shooting ?
we found a survivor .
and you shot him ?
she was crazed .
she bit me .
she' s gone .
she' s gone !
that' s bullshit !
she fell right here , but she' s gone !
look , look at this .
there' s blood , but it' s not much .
looks like it' s coagulated .
yeah .
it' s not possible .
why not ?
because blood doesn' t do that till after you' re dead .
can we go now ?
we' re not going anywhere till the rest of the team get here .
there' s no one else coming .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
wait .
quiet .
fuck !
don' t come any closer !
they' re behind us .
jesus !
they' re everywhere .
they' re everywhere .
they' re all around us .
i said stay back !
why aren' t they dying ?
watch the tank !
the tank !
let' s go !
hurry up !
wait !
come on , let' s go !
move !
keep moving !
come on !
move !
i can help you get the virus .
i have access to security codes , surveillance plans , the works .
shit !
we lost the others !
keep moving !
you waited ?
didn' t know the code .
come on , come on .
shit !
come on .
come on .
hurry up .
come on , man .
shit !
what' s taking so long ?
i' m trying !
come on .
move !
what' s the code ?
hurry up !
i' m running out of ammo !
zero , four , three , two no , five !
what ?
zero , four , three
what is the code ?
zero , four ... zero , three , one ... nine , six , five .
got it ?
see how easy that was ?
shit !
j. d. , no !
grab my hand , man !
come on !
don' t let go !
j. d. !
rain !
where are the bodies ?
where did they go ?
fuck !
whatever they are , there' s too many of them out there .
whatever they are ?
it' s pretty obvious what they are .
lab coats , badges .
those people used to work here !
all the people working here are dead .
well , that isn' t stopping them from walking around .
well , where did they come from ?
why didn' t we see them on the way in ?
when you cut the power , you unlocked the doors .
you let them out .
we' re never gonna make it to the surface .
you are security operatives .
security operatives placed there to protect that entrance .
i' ve got one in the breech and an extra mag .
lisa ?
i can help you get the virus .
i have access to security codes , surveillance plans , the works .
but ?
but there' s gonna be a price .
name it .
who was she ?
my sister .
corporations like umbrella think they' re above the law .
but they' re not .
there are hundreds of thousands of us who think the same ... all over the world .
some of us provide information ... others give their support .
some take more direct action .
like you .
if your friends had been a little more thorough ... they would' ve seen right through my false id .
then all the red flags would' ve gone off
quantico , nsa , vicap , all the rest .
there' s no way i could' ve infiltrated the hive .
so you sent your sister .
we needed something concrete .
anything to expose umbrella to the press .
proof of the research that was going on down here .
what kind of research ?
the illegal kind .
genetic .
viral .
my sister was going to smuggle out ... a sample of the virus they were developing .
so how was she going to make it out of here ?
she had a contact within the hive , someone i never met .
they had access to security codes , surveillance , everything she needed .
so why didn' t she make it ?
maybe she trusted the wrong person .
maybe they set her up .
kept the virus for themselves .
do you know how much the t virus would be worth on the open market ?
what , worth all this ?
yeah .
to someone .
don' t shoot !
don' t shoot !
close that door !
they' re right behind us !
get off !
get off !
stop it !
son of a bitch !
you okay ?
yeah .
right behind us .
what about this door ?
they' re waiting out there too .
and that way ?
it' s a dead end .
there' s no way out of the queen' s chamber .
so we wait .
if someone doesn' t hear from you , they' il send backup or something .
right ?
what ?
what' s wrong ?
we don' t have much time .
you know those blast doors we passed ... on the way in from the mansion ?
they seal shut in just under an hour .
if we' re not out of here by then , we' re not getting out .
what are you talking about ?
they can' t just bury us alive down here .
containing the incident is the only fail safe plan they had ... against possible contamination .
and you' re only telling us this now , when we' re trapped ... half a mile underground ?
we have to find a way out of this room .
what are you doing ?
where are you taking those ?
i' m turning her back on .
that is not a good idea .
she' il know a way out of here .
that homicidal bitch killed my team .
that homicidal bitch may be our only way out of here .
considering the way she' s being treated , i' m sure she' il be happy to help us out .
that circuit breaker you were talking about .
can you bypass it ?
yeah .
so do it .
all right , circuit breaker is disabled .
this time if i hit the switch , she won' t be able to shut down .
she' s gonna fry .
kaplan ?
the initial charge must have damaged her boards .
ah , there you are .
things , i gather , have gone out of control .
give me that fucking switch right now .
i' m gonna fry your ass .
i did warn you , didn' t i ?
tell us what' s going on down here .
research and development .
what about the t virus ?
the t virus was a major medical breakthrough ... although it clearly also possessed highly profitable military applications .
how does it explain those things out there ?
even in death , the human body still remains active .
hair and fingernails continue to grow .
new cells are produced ... and the brain itself holds a small electrical charge ... that takes months to dissipate .
the t virus provides a massive jolt ... both to cellular growth ... and to those trace electrical impulses .
put quite simply ... it reanimates the body .
it brings the dead back to life ?
not fully .
the subjects have the simplest of motor functions .
perhaps a little memory .
virtually no intelligence .
they are driven by the basest of impulses ... the most basic of needs .
which is ?
the need to feed .
how do you kill them ?
severing the top of the spinal column or massive trauma to the brain ... are the most effective methods .
you mean shoot them in the head .
why did you kill everybody down here ?
the t virus escaped into the air conditioning system ... and an uncontrolled pattern of infection began .
the virus is protean ... changing from liquid to airborne to blood transmission ... depending on its environment .
it' s almost impossible to kill .
i couldn' t allow it to escape from the hive ... so i took steps .
steps .
you must understand .
those who become infected , i can' t allow you to leave .
whoa .
we' re not infected .
just one bite , one scratch from these creatures is sufficient ... and then you become one of them .
a check of my systems indicates my main drive circuit breaker ... has been disabled .
may i ask why ?
insurance .
we need a way out of here .
if you refuse to help at any time , we flip the switch .
understand ?
after you .
what the hell is this place ?
the utility tunnels .
they run underneath the hive for water , gas and power lines .
it' s been in here before .
keep moving .
we' re going around in circles .
this is the route the computer gave us .
why are you listening to her ?
enough already !
we have no choice but to keep moving ' cause those things are right behind us .
that mesh isn' t gonna hold .
keep moving .
jesus christ !
hold it !
there' s too many of them !
jesus !
fuck !
up on the pipes .
up on the pipes !
quickly , everyone !
let' s go !
come on !
there' s a way up !
watch out !
keep ' em back !
go on up !
move it !
shit .
okay .
get over here !
there' s too many of them !
come on !
go , go , go !
go on !
go !
go !
i can manage !
gotcha !
rain ?
rain .
what ?
we have to do something about your wounds .
i' m fine .
i said i' m fine .
you like that , don' t you ?
huh ?
you like the way it tastes , don' t you ?
like the taste of that ?
she was right .
we' re all gonna die down here .
no .
we' re getting out .
all of us .
kaplan , are you okay ?
oh , god !
hold on !
help him .
i can' t .
what are you waiting for ?
i can' t focus !
i can' t see !
kaplan , go up !
get up there !
you almost got it .
keep going !
come on !
come on !
you can do it !
you got it !
okay , kaplan .
just stay there !
hold on .
we' re gonna come get you .
cut this wire and throw it to him .
then we can go get him .
hold on !
that' s lucky .
i want you to go .
we' re not leaving you , kaplan .
yes , you are .
you can' t kill all of them .
and i' m not going anywhere .
i want you to go .
now !
please .
just do it .
just do it now !
please .
go !
you' re gonna have to work for your meal !
come on .
give me your arm .
up over my shoulder .
ready ?
there we go .
when i get out of here ...
i think i' m gonna get laid .
yeah .
you might want to clean up a little bit first .
hey , wait .
are you okay ?
blue for the virus .
green for the antivirus .
there' s a cure .
what are you talking about ?
there' s a cure .
the process can be reversed .
there' s a cure !
you' re gonna be okay !
i was beginning to worry .
this is where they kept the t virus .
how do you know all this ?
because i was gonna steal it .
i was your sister' s contact .
you betrayed her .
i don' t know .
you caused all of this .
i can' t remember .
the truth .
i don' t remember the truth .
i don' t understand !
it' s gone .
it' s not there .
i can' t .
i just can' t .
it' s over .
i can help you get the virus .
i have access to security codes , surveillance plans , the works .
but there' s gonna be a price .
name it .
you have to guarantee me that you will bring this corporation down .
spence ?
thank you .
spence ?
we can still make it out of here .
come with me .
we can have everything we' ve ever wanted .
money' s out there waiting .
you wouldn' t believe how much .
is that how you thought all my dreams were gonna come true ?
please .
i wouldn' t want to shoot you .
might need the bullets .
back off .
i won' t take any part in this .
okay , but you can' t just ... wash your hands of this .
we work for the same company .
you knew what they did .
i was trying to stop them .
you really believe that ... people like him ... will ever change anything ?
nothing ... ever changes .
where is ... the antivirus ?
it' s on the train ... where you found me .
couldn' t have been standing more than three feet from it .
i so nearly made it out .
didn' t realize that bitch of a computer had defense systems outside the hive .
in or out ?
in ... or out ?
i don' t know what we had ... but it' s over .
back ... the fuck off .
i' m missing you already .
your boyfriend' s a real asshole .
he shot the locking mechanism out .
i can' t believe that son of a bitch is gonna get away with this .
i don' t think so .
i' ve been a bad , bad girl .
oh , my god .
what the fuck is that ?
one of the hive' s early experiments ... produced by injecting the t virus directly into living tissue .
the results were unstable .
now that it has fed on fresh dna , it will mutate ...
becoming a stronger , faster hunter .
great .
if you knew it was loose , why didn' t you warn us ?
' cause she was saving it for us .
isn' t that right ?
i didn' t think any of you would make it this far .
not without infection .
why didn' t you tell us about the antivirus ?
this long after infection ... there' s no guarantee it would work .
but there' s a chance , right ?
i don' t deal in chance .
fuck it .
no pressure , guys .
you require the four digit access code .
i can give you the code , but first you must do something for me .
what do you want ?
one of your group is infected .
i require her life for the code .
the antivirus is right there on the platform .
it' s right there !
i' m sorry .
it' s a risk i cannot take .
she' s right .
it' s the only way .
you' re gonna have to kill me .
otherwise we all die down here .
the glass is reinforced ... but it won' t hold forever .
do it .
no .
get up .
just do it .
rain , please get up .
do it !
you don' t have long to decide .
get up , please .
you have no choice .
kill her .
kill her now .
you don' t have any choice .
just do it now !
i can' t !
please .
do it .
kill her .
just do it .
kill her now !
kill her !
the bitch wouldn' t open the door , so i had to fry her .
move .
what the fuck was that ?
it' s a long story .
start it up .
i' il get the virus .
i' m missing you already .
okay , we' re in business .
full power .
we' re leaving !
i don' t want to be one of those things ... walking around without a soul .
you won' t .
when the time comes ... you' il take care of it .
no one else is gonna die .
okay ?
here .
i' m not dead yet .
i think i' il have that back .
i could kiss you , you bitch .
what' s going on back there ?
get us the fuck out of here !
any faster , we' il come off the rails !
open the doors !
open the doors !
now !
i failed all of them .
i failed .
listen to me .
there is nothing else you could' ve done .
the corporation' s guilty here , not you .
and we finally have the proof .
that way umbrella can' t get get away with this .
what is it ?
you' re infected , but you' re gonna be okay .
i' m not losing you .
help !
help him .
what are you doing ?
matt !
he' s mutating .
i want him in the nemesis program .
get off !
what' s happening ?
matt !
i want her quarantined .
close observation and a full series of blood tests .
let' s see if she' s infected .
take her to the raccoon city facility .
then assemble the team .
we' re reopening the hive .
i want to know what went on down there .
just do it .
who' s in there ?
let me out !
let me out !
who' s in there ?
