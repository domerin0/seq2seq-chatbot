you were very good to us .
it was an honour serving you , sir .
i want to seek out my own kind .
in order to understand my destiny , i must know if there is another like myself .
north am robotics will not return my inquiries .
now that you' ve finally passed the bar , lloyd ... ... i want you to sue them for information of the whereabouts of all ndr robots .
if you don' t mind .
the freedom of information act doesn' t quite cover suits by robots .
not yet .
mother , i' m a very busy man .
i do not have time to help it ... ... pursue some ridiculous lawsuit .
lloyd , sweetheart , i do love you .
but sometimes i have to wonder if you really are my child .
well , that' s mutation , mother .
i' m not you .
you' ve always been more like your father .
so that' s why you divorced him .
sorry .
what would you do if i got the information on these other ndrs ?
i would seek them out .
each and every one .
so you' d be gone for quite a long time .
yes .
several years , if not more , if my calculations are correct .
i' d love to help you .
did he not breast feed ?
my journey is nearing the end of its tenth year .
i still have not found any robot that bears any similarity to myself .
i have thousands of miles to go , hundreds of cities to visit ...
... so i have not given up hope .
love , andrew .
hello .
my last name is martin .
get off the field .
my journey is nearing its end .
i' ve exhausted all possibilities save for one final ray of hope .
i' ve learned of an ndr robot that has recently been rebuilt ...
... back home in san francisco .
thank you .
you' re quite welcome .
is this yours ?
thank you .
i' m looking for rupert burns .
you' ve come to the right place .
come in .
certainly have .
do you have a name ?
of course i do .
galatea .
galatea .
you have an amazing agility .
you were dancing in the market .
did you like that ?
very much .
dancing is the sportiest sport .
and we' re so much better at it than humans .
i can' t believe i finally found you .
when did you know ?
know what ?
that you were unique ?
i knew that right away .
me , too .
you and i , we' re the same .
we have personality .
is your personality chip turned on ?
isn' t yours ?
no .
sucks to be you !
i think personality is much more fun than intelligence .
don' t you ?
i think so .
can i help you ?
your robot is just a standard ndr , isn' t she ?
yeah , i' m afraid so .
why does she have the ability to dance ?
because i put a modified skeletal chip into her during her rebuild .
how did you do the modification ?
my father taught me .
he created the android unit at north am robotics .
he created the technology that allows you to mimic human expression .
what happened to him ?
north am laid him off , so we started this place .
i took over when he died .
i' m sorry to hear that .
he would' ve been absolutely thrilled to meet you .
i' m rupert burns .
it' s a real honour .
the honour is mine .
you and i , we' re the same !
let' s get loco , robo !
shut her off , or i will !
thank you .
is this your father' s work ?
yeah .
it' s our work , you could say .
i haven' t been able to restrain myself from continuing to tinker with ... ... the relentlessly unfashionable android technology .
as a matter of fact , i' ve actually gotten to a point ... ... where i can pretty much exactly replicate the external physical appearance ... ... of a human being .
remarkable .
thank you .
amazing !
unfortunately , nobody seems terribly interested in funding my research , but
i am .
i will fund your research .
yeah ?
that' d be cool .
thank you , darling .
i want to make it very clear this is an external physical upgrade only .
strictly speaking , you' il feel nothing .
none of your internal mechanisms will be changed .
you' il be subject to your positronic brain .
is that clear ?
understood .
now , have you given any thought whatsoever ... ... as to what age you' d like to be ?
officially , i am 62 years old .
let' s take off 25 years .
15 .
20 .
perfect .
believe it or not , the secret to all this is actually imperfection .
imperfection ?
things like wrinkles , less than perfect teeth .
details like fading scars , little pockmarks .
look at my nose .
see my nose ?
it' s bulbous and slightly irregular .
it is .
i' m the only one who has my nose .
that' s what makes me me .
we must incorporate these features into your design so that you can be ... ... the only one of you .
that' s what makes us unique is those imperfections .
i see .
like the shape of your head .
what about the shape of my head ?
it' s huge .
but lovely .
thank you .
what happened ?
what' s going on ?
what happened ?
i saw the inner me .
is it ready ?
please be careful .
don' t drop me .
i' m being careful .
oh , my god !
just relax .
relax .
why did you do that ?
that wasn' t very funny .
just keeping you on your toes .
i don' t have any toes .
you do now .
i do .
and hands .
and fingers !
how do i look ?
see for yourself .
thank you .
beautiful .
sorry .
who are you ?
andrew .
andrew ?
you look wonderful .
even younger .
how do you do that ?
do i know you ?
i know i look different , too .
i' ve had an upgrade .
touch it .
sorry .
the face .
what' s going on ?
you leave her alone !
who are you ?
andrew .
no .
andrew ?
but andrew' s a robot .
yes , i am .
well , now an android .
he' s had an upgrade .
i know that .
hello .
hello .
it is you !
you know him ?
yes .
you know me ?
who' re you ?
i' m little miss .
that' s little miss .
no .
no .
that' s portia .
portia ?
who' s portia ?
my granddaughter .
your granddaughter ?
is this some kind of trick ?
you' re little miss ?
then what right do you have to look like her ?
there is and can be only one little miss .
really ?
it' s a genetic resemblance .
sometimes it skips a generation .
i don' t care .
i don' t like it .
i can see that .
if you took a moment , which i see you' re not inclined to do ... ... you' d realise portia and i are very different people .
why is she imitating you ?
what' s so funny ?
you are .
i' m not trying to be funny .
things have certainly changed around here .
that happens after 20 years .
i have so much to tell you .
come with me .
it is you .
yes .
hello , my friend .
hello , little miss .
whose daughter is she ?
lloyd' s .
now the rudeness makes sense .
go home to your master .
you don' t have a home , do you ?
i don' t have food .
i don' t eat .
come in .
we' il keep each other company .
i know you don' t like me .
i don' t like you either .
i just want to make that clear .
couldn' t be more clear if you spat in my face .
i can' t .
i don' t have a mucous gland .
would it be possible to have a slightly longer conversation ?
may my canine companion enter also ?
thank you .
is this your sculpture ?
no , i' m restoring it .
i' m a preservation architect .
it' s quite horrendous .
how ugly was it before you restored it ?
first you get mad at me because of how i look .
now you show up at my door , announce that you don' t like me ... ... and then you criticise my work .
once again , i apologise for telling the truth but it can' t be helped .
it' s my programming .
what is it exactly that you want ?
family .
my last name is martin .
i' m so named because your great grandfather and grandmother ... ... considered me to be a member of your family .
now sir is dead .
little miss is getting older .
you don' t like me , but you' il talk to me if i knock on your door long enough .
is that a joke ?
no .
would you like to hear a joke ?
this buddhist says to a hot dog vendor , " make me one with everything .
andrew , do you have any friends at all ?
no .
only woofy , who' s very sweet , but not challenging on a conversational level .
that is the extent of his skills .
so you want someone to talk to ?
with .
even if that person doesn' t like you ?
you can' t have everything .
is that right ?
is it , " you can have everything " ?
some people do , so i' m somewhat confused on that level .
sit down .
let' s talk .
thank you .
hey there , handsome .
could i get you anything to drink ?
i' m sorry .
i have no stomach .
could i get something for him ?
he has a stomach , yes .
how is she ?
she' s sleeping .
what happened ?
she had a stroke .
there you are .
little miss .
she' s gone .
it' s cruel that you can cry and i cannot .
there is a terrible pain i cannot express .
will every human being that i care for ... ... just leave ?
i' m afraid so .
that won' t do .
this is remarkably impressive .
you did this all by yourself ?
yes .
i downloaded every known medical textbook into my memory .
i studied them .
that' s how i came up with these drawings .
i know they' re primitive and not complete .
i need you to fill in the mechanical gaps .
this is another upgrade .
it' s considerably more than an upgrade .
you' re talking about a profound transition ... ... from the mechanical to the biological .
i realise that .
i believe it is the ideal marriage of both fields .
not only that , but this stuff could cut both ways .
i don' t think that any existing prosthetic devices hold a candle ... ... to what you' ve designed here .
i mean , you could use these in human beings as well .
exactly .
what a piece of faecal matter .
shit .
excuse me ?
what a piece of shit .
i know that .
when you' re frustrated you say , " piece of shit .
piece of shit .
yes , but with feeling .
what a piece of shit .
more .
what a piece of shit !
good , very good .
are you aware that what you' ve essentially designed here ... ... is a human central nervous system ?
that was my intention , yes .
well , you got to realise that a nervous system will radically enhance ... ... the way you feel and perceive the world around you .
i' m not just talking about hot and cold and little tiny pinpricks .
put it this way .
as your experience becomes varied ... ... so will the feelings , emotions , sensations stimulated by that experience .
and , while some of these will be very subtle ... ... and wonderful , and nuanced , and shaded ... ... others will be profoundly intense and difficult to tolerate .
do you feel like you' re ready for that ?
absolutely .
lovely .
thank you .
i was referring to the statue .
i know .
could you fix this piece of shit ?
i don' t know .
let me take a look .
andrew , i' m sure you could restore this yourself .
yes , i could ... ... but you could do it much better .
i' d be happy to fix it for you .
lf it' s not too much effort .
no , not at all .
i' ve been working all day and i could use some air .
do you want to go for a walk ?
that would be quite splendid .
yes .
why are you laughing at me ?
you' re always so polite and so proper .
it' s very sweet .
thank you .
let' s go .
thank you .
when a man' s an empty kettle he should be on his mettle
and yet i' m torn apart
it' s because i' m presumin ' that i could be kinda human
if i only had a heart
" picture me a balcony ....
do you have an impact drill ?
over on the rack .
thank you .
jesus !
there' s a party next week to celebrate the opening of a building that i restored .
all my friends will be there .
it would be great if you could come .
i would love to .
thank you .
i think you' re letting me win .
checkmate .
charles , why don' t you go get us a drink ?
thank you .
i never understood the phrase , " pearls before swans .
what ?
" swine .
then the ballet is not " swine lake .
oh , god .
nobody makes me laugh like you .
laughter is essential for a good friendship .
yes , it is .
sometimes i get the feeling that ... ... you feel a certain way about us ... ... and that you wish your ....
what ?
i don' t know .
it' s just a little ....
having this conversation with ....
a robot ?
yes .
i mean , a thing is itself , andrew .
a tree is a tree .
water is water .
you are a magnificent machine .
no matter how much you change , that' s what you' il always be .
no .
i can' t believe that , will not believe that .
i realise i am not entirely human .
that' s why people don' t always like or understand me .
i like you .
you do ?
i even understand you some of the time .
but i can' t invest my emotions in a machine .
it must be a genetic trait .
things change , portia .
things always change .
she laughed at me .
a thing is itself , andrew .
water is water .
what about ice ?
what about steam ?
andy , you got to calm down .
do you know what it' s like to be laughed at ?
humiliating .
it' s an abomination .
look at me .
look what i' m doing here .
i' m trying to make something of myself .
i' m trying to fulfil my destiny .
does she notice ?
i don' t want you to take this personally , but i have to work now .
good night .
where have you been ?
i' ve been trying to call you .
poke me in the eye .
what ?
poke me in the eye !
you' re crazy .
poke me in the eye !
that hurts !
it works !
what the hell' s going on ?
it' s my neural net !
i' m the proud owner of a nervous system .
you can feel .
yes , very much !
do something for me ?
perform an experiment for the sake of science .
all right .
kiss me .
no , not there .
here .
thank you .
could you feel it ?
it' s wonderful .
it' s everything they say it is .
and you ?
what' s wrong ?
charles and i are getting married .
he' s a lucky man .
congratulations to the both of you .
goddamn it , andrew !
if you' re going to succeed at this thing you' re trying to do ... ... you' ve got to stop being so damn deferential .
i can' t help being deferential .
it' s built in .
then change .
change ?
i have changed .
i don' t mean on the outside .
change on the inside .
take chances , make mistakes .
sometimes it' s important not to be perfect .
it' s important to do the wrong thing !
do the wrong thing ?
yes .
why ?
i see .
to learn from your mistakes .
no .
to make them !
to find out what' s real and what' s not , to find out what you feel .
human beings are terrible messes .
i' il grant you that .
i see .
this is what is known as an irrational conversation , isn' t it ?
this is a human conversation .
it' s not about being rational .
it' s about following your heart .
and that' s what i should do ?
yes .
and you have a heart , andrew .
i feel it .
i don' t even believe it sometimes , but i do feel it .
and in order to follow that heart ...
... one must do the wrong thing .
yes .
thank you .
could you be a little more careful ?
that' s very delicate equipment .
sorry !
what are you doing ?
near as i can tell , your bitch work !
my what ?
you heard me , and i' m sick of it !
all day long it' s , " yes , rupert , sir , " " no , rupert , sir .
would you like another beverage , rupert , sir ? " and it chaps my ass !
so here' s a helpful hint for you .
shut up , and let me do my work !
i' m done .
chaps my ass " ?
where' s the chip ?
i replaced it .
she' s uncooperative , abusive , confrontational
and a lot more interesting .
arguably , but we' re not getting any work done .
please give me the old personality chip back .
fine .
she can be perky again .
perky " ?
she' s just a robot
i didn' t mean it that way .
i really didn' t mean that .
what' s the matter with you today ?
where are you going ?
aunt jamie , i want you too meet charles .
this is my aunt jamie .
nice to meet you .
what' s going on ?
portia' s parents are giving an engagement party ... ... that i wasn' t invited to for obvious reasons .
there he is .
who ?
the prospective groom .
where ?
where ?
the one in the pale blue suit with the big pointy chin !
he' s got a pointy chin ?
you can put an eye out with that chin !
that' s nothing compared to his teeth .
look at that !
i' m amazed he' s out in daylight .
yeah , he' s got funny teeth .
you need to upgrade your eyes .
that shouldn' t stop portia .
she can marry whoever she likes .
one day she' il wake up and realise she' s married to a man ... ... whose face closely resembles an antique can opener .
the kind that used to go ....
the ones that move around , and the can pops off .
you' re jealous .
no , i' m not !
you' re jealous !
you are .
otherwise , what' re you doing spying on portia ?
my god , i am jealous .
if i' m jealous , that means i' m in love .
if i' m in love , then all hope is gone .
i' ve lost her .
would you like a sip of my beer ?
it' d be a waste .
i could not taste it .
what if you could ?
that would be exquisite .
i' ve come up with a design , or a modification rather ... ... that if i' m correct , would enable you to deal with solid foods and liquids .
and taste ?
taste , too .
and also , if my schematics are correct ... ... i think i' ve come up with a method to make you a complete man .
complete ?
complete .
complete ?
not in a reproductive sense , of course , but in terms of approximating ... ... the physical sensation , you know , that occurs ...
... friction .
sexual relations ?
i' ve always been fascinated by that .
i mean , curious .
because of what they say .
what do they say ?
that you can lose yourself .
everything .
all boundaries , all time .
that two bodies can become so mixed up ... ... that you don' t know who' s who or what' s what .
and just when the sweet confusion is so intense you think you' il die ... ... you kind of do , leaving you alone in your separate body .
but the one you love is still there .
that' s a miracle .
you can go to heaven and come back alive .
go back , anytime you want with the one you love .
and you want to experience that ?
yes , please .
so do i.
excuse me .
i' il be right back .
i didn' t expect to see you .
i remember this place very well .
this is where your grandmother was married .
i wanted it ready for my own wedding .
so you' re not married yet ?
no , two weeks from saturday .
i' m not too late .
are you positive you' re doing the right thing ?
positive .
about getting married ?
i' m never positive about anything .
you could be doing the wrong thing .
i' m pretty sure i' m doing the right thing .
great .
why is that great ?
you told me to do the wrong thing .
you aren' t doing the wrong thing , you' re doing the right thing .
you' re not following your own advice , ' cause if you were you wouldn' t marry him .
because i would be doing the right thing .
precisely .
in some strange way , you' re starting to make sense .
good .
you know what it' s like to be in love with someone who' s marrying someone else ?
someone who' s magnificent ?
someone who walks into a room and lights it up like the sun ?
someone who you know is lying to herself ?
lying ?
convincingly .
very much so .
about what ?
that you don' t love me when i know , at least in some way , you do .
and how do you know that ?
i have done everything , inside and out .
that stuff doesn' t matter to me .
something matters .
if nothing mattered , you' d love me ... ... and not some man whose chin could sink the titanic .
what ?
see ?
it' s true , isn' t it ?
sorry .
does he light you up like this ?
does he make you laugh ?
nobody makes me laugh like this .
good .
then admit it .
admit that you love me .
give me one kiss .
that' s all .
one quick kiss .
just one kiss could not jeopardise a glorious marriage .
it would also explain why your pulse just jumped from 66 to 102 beats per minute .
your respiration is doubled .
you' re putting out clouds of pheromones .
it' s not fair to read me like that .
i know .
love isn' t fair .
i' m reading your heart .
i' m asking you to follow it .
begging you .
begging is supposed to be humiliating .
i don' t care .
i love you , portia .
i loved you the very first moment i saw you .
i thought you said a quick kiss .
i lied !
how do you feel ?
wonderful .
so do i.
i guess that' s the point .
what was that ?
it' s your stomach growling .
you' re hungry .
was that me ?
yes .
i thought it was you .
no , it wasn' t me .
really ?
do you do that ?
sometimes , but quieter than that .
i' il have to have rupert make me a muffler .
it' s wonderful .
it' s wonderful , the taste and the texture both .
it' s marvellous .
i know this will be my fourth helping , but may i please have some more ?
pig .
very smart animal .
obviously not that smart if it ends up as bacon .
i feel like i' m eating my way through the entire food chain .
thank you .
what ?
what' s wrong ?
if we' re together ... ... you and me , we' il never be accepted .
because i' m not human .
that will not do .
i will have to get started .
started with what ?
the next step .
i love you .
wish me luck .
andrew martin .
step forward , please .
so , mr. martin ... ... you would like us to pass a bill declaring you a human being .
yes .
specifically , the ability to marry a fellow human being .
i see .
we have to face the undeniable fact ... ... that no matter how much you may be like a human being ... ... you are not part of the human gene pool .
you are outside of it entirely .
you are something else .
something artificial .
sir , what about all the real people wading in the gene pool ... ... who are full of prosthetic devices , many of which i have invented ?
you yourself , sir , have one of my kidneys , do you not ?
are you not in some way artificial , at least in part ?
in part , yes .
then i' m human , in part .
which part , andrew ?
this one , sir .
i see .
and here ?
it is true , i am still equipped with a positronic brain .
and because of that positronic brain you are , for all accounts , immortal .
yes , sir .
andrew , society can tolerate an immortal robot ... ... but we will never tolerate an immortal human .
it arouses too much jealousy , too much anger .
i' m sorry , andrew .
this court cannot and will not validate your humanity .
i hereby bring an end to these proceedings .
it is the decision of this court that andrew martin , from this day forward ... ... will continue to be declared a robot .
a mechanical machine , nothing more .
one is glad to be of service .
andrew , i have to tell you ... ... l' m beginning to feel not so sure .
about us ?
no .
next week will be my 75th birthday
i know , and you look 50 .
thank you .
a spectacular 50 .
but i don' t feel 50 .
your body does .
last night was amazing .
what was that called again ?
shut up and listen to me !
sorry .
don' t give me that look , i' m not ordering you around .
whatever you say .
don' t be agreeable .
i' m not being agreeable .
i can be if you want me to .
goddamn it !
i' m trying to tell you something important here .
i' m not going to live forever .
yes , you will .
that' s why i invented all  no , no .
i won' t always take your dna elixirs .
i won' t have all my organs replaced .
eventually , i' m going to wear out .
and i want to .
why would you want to leave ?
there' s an order to things .
human beings are meant to be here for a certain time and then pass on .
that' s what' s right .
i see .
there' s just one problem , portia .
i couldn' t stand to live without you .
andrew , people grow through time .
but then , for you , time is a completely different proposition .
for you , time is endless .
there is only one thing to do .
galatea , my dear , where are we ?
the transfusion is almost complete .
is that so ?
just goes to show you , andrew .
somebody becomes a human being ... ... sooner or later , they do something monumentally stupid .
you' ve been a great example , rupert .
how quickly will the blood degrade my system ?
i don' t know .
you exercise , eat right , say , 30 , 40 years .
that' s a little vague , chief .
you don' t know exactly how long i' il last ?
sorry .
welcome to the human condition .
andrew martin ?
i' ve always tried to make sense of things .
there must be some reason i am as i am .
as you can see , madam chairman , i am no longer immortal .
you have arranged to die ?
in a sense , i have .
i am growing old and my body is deteriorating .
and , like all of you , it' il eventually cease to function .
as a robot i could have lived forever .
but i tell you all today i would rather die a man ... ... than live for all eternity as a machine .
why do you want this ?
to be acknowledged for who and what i am ... ... no more , no less ... ... not for acclaim , not for approval ... ... but the simple truth of that recognition .
this has been the elemental drive of my existence .
and it must be achieved ... ... if i am to live or die with dignity .
what you' re asking for is ... ... extremely complex and controversial .
it will not be an easy decision .
i must ask for your patience ... ... while i take the necessary time to make a determination ... ... of this extremely delicate matter .
then i await your decision , madame chairman .
thank you for your patience .
we tried .
is it almost time ?
in a few minutes .
it doesn' t matter what the world congress says .
why do you need their approval ?
old habit .
i started my existence as a robot .
i still like to be told certain things .
it' s time .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... miss marjorie botha , president of the world congress .
according to records of the north am robotics company ... ... the robot , also known as andrew martin ... ... was powered up at 5 : 15 p . m . on april 3 , 2005 .
in a few hours , he will be 200 years old ... ... which means with the exception of methuselah and other biblical figures ... ... andrew is the oldest living human being in recorded history .
by this proclamation , i validate his marriage to portia charney ... ... and acknowledge his humanity .
i' m sorry he didn' t see it .
maybe he didn' t need to .
could you do me a favour ?
would you mind unplugging me ?
that' s an order .
thank you , galatea .
one is glad to be of service .
see you soon .
