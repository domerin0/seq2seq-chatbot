that' s j. d. he' s lactose intolerant .
and he' s not very bright .
that' s darren silverman .
he' s a romantic .
but when it comes to women , he' s incredibly gullible .
that' s me , wayne .
i' m loyal to my friends .
i' d beat you up if you weren' t a girl .

after that , i started working out .
we stayed best friends throughout high school .
i was the third string quarterback .
j. d. became the school mascot .

her family was with the circus .
her dad was the strong man .
her mom was the bearded lady .
her brother was the dog faced boy .
before i mustered the courage to ask her out , she moved away .

and sandy ... ... sandy perkus ... ... was my one and only .

he launched it .
touchdown !
i don' t want you to see wayne or j. d. ever again , darren !
but they' re my best friends .
you' re getting new friends , and you' re quitting that bullshit band .
i know you' re upset .
i do .
but i am not dropping wayne and j. d ... ... and i' m not quitting the band .
okay , fine .
no more sex .
what ?
you' re not allowed to go down on me for one month .
no , judith , please ...
don' t make me take away your masturbation privileges .
you go , boys .
you sing this song .
you know it .
come on , boys .
sing it !
sing it !
this blows , man .
judith' s out of control .
we gotta do something .
besides ruining the band , what else has she done ?
ever since she moved in with him , she' s controlled his life .
she didn' t like his ass .
made him get butt cheek implants .
i thought his ass looked tighter .
check this out .
last night ... ... torched his neil diamond albums .
she torched neil ?
you' re right .
she' s a monster .
two , three , four .
hey !
yes !
hey , guys , sorry i' m late .
it' s all right .
i only have a minute .
i have to wax judith' s legs .
we miss you .
we never see you anymore .
i know , i' m sorry ... ... but i' ve just been so happy spending time with judith .
plus , my relationship counseling sessions ...
counseling ?
yeah .
i go two hours , three times a week .
oh .
who' s your counselor ?
judith .
we don' t think she' s right for you .
break up with her .
she' s ruining our lives and yours .
this graph should illustrate our point .
93 .
it is now an eight .
band numbers have plunged dramatically .
girls , never very high , at nine .
but look now .
two !
this has led to increased wanking off .
i' m chafing .
shit , i gotta go home and heat the wax .
guys , listen .
thanks for your concern , really .
i miss you too .
but it was great seeing you , all right ?
that guy' s in serious trouble .
we need to save him .
sorry to bother you .
what are you doing here ?
we want to apologize for the beer shower .
and the salsa bath .
that was bad .
get the hell out of here .
just give us a minute , okay ?
my rate is $200 an hour .
do you have any money ?
i got some of that .
just give me the big bills .
six .
is that all you have ?
thirty . $7 . 38 .
two and a half minutes .
we don' t want you seeing darren .
we don' t think you' re right for him .
the band needs him .
but we' re prepared to buy you off .
with what ?
my house .
okay ?
look .
my grandma here ?
she was born in this house , is buried in the back yard .
there' s my mom ... ... there' s my dad and there' s me .
my dad was dropping me on my head .
but ... ... we' re willing to sign this over to you ... ... if you just agree not to see darren .
i don' t want your shitty house or your dead grandma .
i' il throw j. d. in .
he doesn' t look like much ... ... but he' s hung like a horse .
it' s true .
look , darren' s mine .
there' s nothing you can do about it .
i own him .
he does whatever i say .
i' m in complete control of him .
he' s my puppet and i' m his puppet master .
you' re not taking darren away !
just try to stop me .
one round , winner takes darren .
you' re on .
kick her ass .
go .
you' ve got quite a grip .
you must be a heavy masturbator .
my guess is three times a day ?
i bet you' re a premature ejaculator .
you start off with a big bang .
before you know it , you' re limp .
i win , you lose .
now get out .
god !
hey , check it out .
hey , baby .
hello , ladies .
so how much ?
fifty bucks for you , and 200 for your friend .
okay .
all right .
i want you to laugh like he just said something .
perfect !

he' s cheating on you .
with two chicks .
i don' t know .
i guess i' d dump him ?
oh , totally .
right ?
do you guys notice anything weird about these photos ?
no , that' s darren , all right .
darren doesn' t have a tattoo .
nice try , idiots .
if i ever see you near darren again ... ... i' il kill you .
thanks for meeting me here .
i have something important to say .
oh , man .
you broke up ?
no .
out of the blue , judith proposed to me .
we' re engaged .
what ?
dude , congratulations .
starting next week , i' il be mr. darren fessbeggler .
right , because you' re gonna take her last name , huh ?
yeah , well ... ... judith feels , and i think she' s got a really good point here ... ... that it' s sexist for the woman to take the man' s last name .
anyway , it' s too late to change it .
we' ve already ordered the monogrammed towels .
darren .
sandy ?
sandy perkus .
oh , my god , darren .
it' s been so long .
yeah , it has .
hey , it' s wayne .
high school , remember ?
you remember ?
right !
the senior talent show .
yeah , you were booed off the stage .
that was me .
yep .
sandy , remember me ?
j. d. mcnugent ?
i went to the prom ... ... with a tuxedo painted on my naked body .
oh , i guess i missed it .
i spilled a drink and the paint ran and everyone could see my dong .
it doesn' t ring a bell .
remember , in science , i was lighting farts with the bunsen burner ... ... and i singed my ball sac ?
no .

i still can' t grow hair on my left nut .

excuse me , i' il get it .
is darren here ?
i think he left his vespa helmet .
what' s going on ?
we' re having our engagement party .
oh , then i guess our invitations must' ve been lost in the mail .
no .
i think it' s very possible she didn' t even send us invitations .
thanks for stopping by .
who' s darren talking to ?
those are his new friends .
i' il have a merlot .
a spritzer .
we don' t work here .
you fooled me .
my name' s brett , this is clayton .

darren' s our friend , brett .
we knew him first .
fuck you , replacement friend !

stop it !
do something !
get out of here !
hey , this isn' t over yet !
we' re not giving up on darren !
she thinks this gig is over .
it' s not over .

but we are taking this into overtime !
yeah !
okay , strategy session .
okay , our enemy is wicked .
dude , she' s freddy krueger .
no , damien .
dude , she' s vader .

but with really great tits .
okay , now , sandy ?
that girl , she' s a nice girl .
she' s a sweetheart .
dude , a saint .
a goddess .
a princess .
you know what ?
she' s kind of like mother teresa .
but with way better tits .
and darren loves sandy no matter what he says .
definitely .
that' s why we have to intervene and fix the problem !
definitely !
all right !
we' re gonna kidnap judith and set darren up with sandy .
what ?
the bat is leaving the cave .
roger that .
alarm system has been deactivated .
out .
roger that .
dude , you don' t have to do the ... ... sound .
it already does that .
out .
copy that .
i' m not going to make the ... ... sound after i say stuff from now on .
shady mcnugent ... ... over and out .
that was the last one .
i' m scared .
what if we get caught ?
not gonna happen .
i' m hungry .
we' il eat later .
can we go to happy burger ?
yes , after the kidnapping .
i' m gonna get a chubby checker with ...
with cheese .
what ?
you go downstairs and i' il check upstairs .
do the navy seal signals .
i only know the air force signals .
i' il be on the lookout .
god !
i haven' t located her yet .
me neither .
keep checking .
wait a second .
i think i see something in the back of the refrig ...
in the back of the closet .
check it out .
nope .
coast is clear .
i' il keep looking down here , buddy .
you keep an eye peeled up there .
oh , shit .
what is it ?
i' m hit .
i need backup .
i' m coming .
what happ ...
help !
dead leg .
help me , wayne .
oh , my god .
get the door .
get the door .
door .
darren , i' m leaving you .
we' re finished .
done .
don' t call , write , e mail or fax .
i never want to see your face or your fake butt again .
okay , get down there .
dude , wait .
why me ?
because you' re guarding judith .
i' m dealing with darren and sandy .
but when we let her go , she' il be able to identify me .
no .
she won' t be able to because you' il be wearing this .
but after we let her go , the cops will look for a guy dressed as a bird .
so ?
so , what am i gonna wear to work ?
your work clothes .
but tomorrow' s casual friday .
get downstairs !
who the hell are you ?
thanks for meeting me .
i called you out of the blue ...
that' s okay .
i love catching up with old high school friends .
are you single ?
yes .
great .
look , i wanted to talk to you about darren silverman .
he' s a really good guy .
you know what ?
he works with the elderly .
really ?
that is so sweet .
he still talks about you .
there' s something ...
he even writes poems about you .
in fact ... ... i think he loves you .
wayne , i' m gonna become a nun .
in a week , i take my final vows .
i didn' t even know that you were religious .
i wasn' t in high school .
but after i graduated , i joined my parents in the circus .
and i became a trapeze artist .
i fell in love with my partner , luigi panini .
ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous luigi !
and everything was perfect until ... talent scouts were in the audience .
luigi wanted to impress them .
he was a great trapeze artist , but he was completely vain .
and now luigi will attempt the most dangerous stunt ... ... in the history of trapeze ... ... the quadruple bierman .
luigi !
wow .
yeah .
after luigi died , i knew i would never love again .
that' s when i decided to devote my life to serving god and helping others .
so you haven' t taken your final vows yet , right ?
right .
so technically , you' re not a nun yet .
well , no .
i mean , not yet .
so why not then just have lunch with darren ?
i can' t figure out why judith left .
it doesn' t make any sense .
she didn' t even take her clothes .
maybe she went where she didn' t need clothes : a nudist colony .
i don' t think so .
maybe she got kidnapped .
you think ?
no .
definitely not .
that' s impossible .
it' s like , why would that happen in a world ?
maybe she' s a lesbo .
come on .
maybe she' s a herm .
what ?
a hermaphrodite .
little dick , little puss .
guess who i bumped into today .
who ?
sandy perkus , and she wants to see you .
i' m engaged to judith , wayne .
she dumped you , dude .
just have lunch with sandy .
what' s it gonna hurt ?
no way .
judith' s coming back .
what if she doesn' t ?
as long as judith' s alive , i' il never give up on her .
okay ?
okay ?
i got it .
crowbar me .
oh , my god .
what is it ?
this dead chick is really stacked .
okay , go , go .
go .
what are you doing ?
jacket' s caught .
take it off !
i love this jacket !
lose it !
damn !
that was my favorite jacket .
in a bizarre incident last night , judith fessbeggler ... ... was incinerated beyond recognition when her bmw ... ... careened off a cliff .
investigators have declared it an accident .
no foul play is suspected .
in unrelated news , the body of deceased local joan snerd ... ... was dug up in a grave robbing last night .
police arrested three cubans .
why are you doing this ?
so you can eat and have clothes .
no , why did you kidnap me ?
i' m not supposed to tell you .
oh , i get it .
the other guy' s the boss .
no , i make decisions too .
i suggested that .
an outhouse .
clever .
thanks .
you must be very well educated .
i suppose .
ivy league ?
more or less .
which one ?
yale , harvard , princeton ?
s. u.
oh , stanford university ?
subway university .
i knew someone who went there .
did you know j. d. mcnugent ?
no .
no .
never heard of such a person , ever .
see you later , j. d. take it easy , judith .
goddamn it !
she knows who we are ? !
there was nothing i could do .
she used her super intellect on me .
she' s like hannibal lecter .
great .
now we can' t let her go .
so , what are we going to do ?
coach .
coach !
if it ain' t my favorite third string quarterback ... ... and the best damn mascot wheaton high school ever had .
lookit , he' s still got it !
it' s good seeing you boys .
thank you for coming to my trial .
no problem .
we were happy to act as witnesses on your behalf .
that ref blew .
he deserved what he got .
touchdown !
no touchdown .
he' s out of bounds .
what ? !
he' s out of bounds .
you think after you get out of prison they' il let you get your old job back ?
well , boys , i don' t think so .
so when will they let you out ?
well , i' ve got an appeal pending , but it doesn' t look good .
the victim' s whiny family' s protesting .
what' s their damn problem ?
so , what brings you boys here ?
well , coach , we need your advice .
okay , shoot .
darren fell in love with this girl , judith .
and we kidnapped her .
kill her .
wait a minute and let me finish .
so we screwed up because now she knows who we are .
so we can' t let her go , or she' il turn us in .
is that everything ?
kill her .
we can' t kill her .
you can !
wheaton warbirds can do anything they put their minds to .
but , coach , i mean , come on , actually kill a person ?
what is it that i always said ?
if you can dream it , you can do it .
exactly .
you have the dream .
all you have to do is turn it into reality .
okay .
thattaboy !
now , go on home and snuff her .
come on , move .
thanks , coach .
where' s your bird suit ?
i don' t need it , because we' re ...
because we' re gonna kill you .
right ?
you aren' t going to shoot me .

and i got one that' s both .
thanks , j. d.
i really appreciate you taking care of me .
my pleasure .
hey , you strike me as a pretty responsible guy .
thanks .
that' s why i' m surprised that you let wayne boss you around .
wayne' s not ...
no one bosses me around .
wayne' s not the boss of me .
yeah .
i think that you seem depressed and confused .
you think ?
you have a self defeating personality disorder .
have you considered therapy ?
i remember in high school , you were really into helping people .
at parties , you were always the designated driver .
right .
and i remember you were a really good dancer .
and strong too .
you used to be able to lift me up over your head .
still can .
oh , really ?
ready ?
and ...
oh , darren !
help me !
are you okay ?
i can' t ...
just hang on .
i can' t swim .
darren !
are you okay ?
thank you .
thank you for saving me .
no problem .
let it out now .
there you go .
come on .
let' s go , okay ?
you' re a lot stronger than you were in high school .
yeah , well , the convent' s got a great gym .
and ever since then , i' ve been afraid of toilets .
what else can i say about second grade ?
j. d. , let' s fast forward .
have you ever had a girlfriend ?
yes .
no .
have you ever fantasized about having sex with a man ?
which man ?
any man .
you mean , like , a tall man ?
sure , whatever .
i don' t like tall people .
how about a short man ?
how short ?
sometimes people can be too short .
that' s weird , like midgets .
have you fantasized about having sex with any man ?
any man at all ?
does that include celebrities ?
can i ask you something ?
sure .
i mean , not that it matters now ... ... but if i had asked you out back in high school , would you have gone ?
definitely .
not that it matters now , you know .
right .
perfect .
thanks .
could you , you know , turn around ?
right .
yeah , certainly .
i have these .
sorry , sorry , those are ...
thanks .
can you zip me up ?
yeah .
i had a really good time .
me too .
do you want to have dinner tonight ?
i can' t .
tomorrow i have a test in my catechism class ... ... and i have to score at least an 85 so i can take my vows on sunday .
what about tomorrow ?
i' m scheduled to take care of an elderly nun on her death bed .
i understand .
but i' d really like to see you again .
i' il get out of it .
i always knew i was different , and now i know why .
i' m gay .
you' re the only person who' s ever truly understood me .
it' s okay .
just let it out .
everything will be all right .
it' s all gonna be okay .
it' s gonna be just ...

okay , judith , it' s over .
you might as well turn around and head back to the house .
oh , thank god .
hi , officers .
you' re safe .
i' m cowboy wayne .
i just bagged me one of them killer goats ... ... that escaped from the zoo .
good job .
yeah .
okay , then , i' il see you later .
there .
that should hold you for tonight .
don' t !
what the hell happened ?
judith was giving me some therapy ... ... and helped me realize i was gay and ...
wait .
what ?
i see what happened .
she messed with your head .
wayne , i' m gay .
no , you' re not .
you' re just unsuccessful with women .
no , i' m gay .
judith got me in touch with the inner j. d.
how' d she do that ?
she listened .
unlike people who knew me for years and ignored all the telltale signs .
like what ?
like my obsession with bette midler .
my preference for track lighting .
and the fact that i like sucking dick .
what ? !
you' ve done that ? !
not with another guy , but remember when i bought that book on yoga ?
i don' t want to hear anymore .
look , you want to be gay ?
fine !
no problem !
but from now on , i' il take care of judith myself .
okay !
you want to be gay with me ?
no !
come on , go , come on .
all you , all you !
eleven .
okay .
one more .
one more .
come on .
one more .
feel the burn .
come on , now .
eleven .
what' s the matter , dear ?
you never used to be so winded after only five sets .
well , mother superior ... ... i' m having some second thoughts about becoming a nun .
oh , don' t get me wrong .
this is a terrific convent .
but i ...
but ...
well ... ... i' m having these feelings .
what kind of feelings ?
you mean sexual feelings .
yeah , but it' s so much more than that .
yes , well ... ... my dear ... ... you' re the only one who can decide if this is the life you want to live .
but once you take your final vows ... ... there is no going back .
now , let' s go bust out some power squats .
there .
that should keep you from escaping again .
and this ...
this ...
this should keep you from biting .
how am i gonna eat ?
i thought of that .
what is that ?
it' s breakfast .
it' s pancakes , sausage , hash brown , pop tart , pured .
i won' t eat it .
i want a big montana .
a big montana from arby' s with curly fries .
i won' t get you one .
if you won' t eat what i made for you , you can starve !
why are you doing this ? !
to save our friendship .
friendship ?
it seems like you' re in love with darren .
bullshit !
just get over it .
your buddy smokes pole and so do you .
i am so un gay !
let' s pretend you' re straight .
when' s the last time you got any ?
none of your business .
so it' s been years ?
i' m waiting for the right woman .
there is no right woman .
if there was , you' ve already met and she' s killed herself or become gay .
bite me !
blow me !
skank !
eunuch !
stealer of my friend !
what happened to your head ?
i saw judith .
judith' s dead .
yeah , but ... ... i could' ve sworn it was her .
i was on ...
you poor thing .
you' re still not over her death .
maybe we shouldn' t be seeing each other .
no .
no .
god , i' m fine .
and , look , i can deal with this .
okay ?
so , what are you having ?
let' s see .
there' s the duck .
that was always judith' s favorite .
i' m sorry .
i should leave .
no , you shouldn' t .
i' m so sorry .
i will never mention judith' s name again , really .
i swear .
i swear .
would you excuse me for a moment ?
please .
i' il be right back .
okay ?
in a ...
in a moment .
damn it !
what do you want ? !
wayne , it' s me , darren .
i have a problem .
i' m with sandy , but i can' t stop talking about judith .
okay .
i' il be right there .
okay , open up your shirt .
why ?
just do it .
what is this ?
now ... ... here' s what' s gonna happen .
i' m going to listen to your conversation .
now ... ... if you say anything about judith ... ... or so much as mention her name ... ... then i' il give you a little shock .
perfect .
i don' t think i' m comfortable having these things on my nipples .
i could put them on your balls .
the nipples are fine .
nipples work .
hi .
sorry , sorry , sorry .
i' m back .
i am back .
there was a talkative men' s room attendant .
that' s okay .
excuse me .
hey .
this table' s reserved .
you know what ?
i come here all the time , and spend a lot of money ... ... so why not leave me the hell alone ?
i don' t mean to be pushy ... ... but if this relationship is gonna get serious ... ...
i have to give up becoming a nun ... ... and i' d have to decide soon ... ... because my final vows are on sunday .
yeah , that thought had occurred to me .
and if i do that ... ... i need to know that you want marriage and a family .
absolutely .
i never thought i' d say this to anyone after luigi died , but ... ... i love you , darren .
i love you too , judith .
judith ? !
i mean sandy .
i mean , let' s dance .
okay ?
you' re out of here .
put me down !
i haven' t ordered yet !
time for an attitude adjustment , mister .
hey , nice move .
damn , he' s good .
darren !
oh , my god !
oh , jeez .
oh , my god !
are you okay ?
it was a little weird .
what' s going on ?
i can explain .
it' s aversion therapy .
wayne was trying to help me get over judith ... ... so i had these things ...
nipples ...
oh , my god .
it' s so much worse than i thought .
no , you' re obviously not ready for this relationship .
no , i am !
sandy , wait !
okay .
damn it !
wait , wait .
wait , sandy !
oh , my god !
darren .
what happened to you ?
i ran here from the club .
that' s 30 miles !
yeah , i know .
i wanted to say ... ... i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
can you ever forgive me ?
because the whole judith thing and the nipple clamps ... ... it' s crazy , and ...
yes !
really ?
yes .
just like that ?
well , i am training to become a nun , you know .
forgiveness is just sort of my thing .
i love you .
really ?
i love you .
i love you .
oh , love .
love .
happy ?
you didn' t have to do that .
i just happened to be by arby' s .
they were throwing out old food ... ... so , you know , i thought , " why not ?
either way , that' s nice of you .
why darren ?
what do you mean ?
you don' t seem the type to go for a sensitive guy like darren .
you seem more the kind of woman that needs an assertive type of guy .
before i met darren , i was ...
i was engaged to a guy like that .
his idea of fun was to fly to thailand to fight in a kickboxing tournament .
u. s. a. !
go , josh !
after that , i decided no more tough guys .
yeah , and then you found darren .
yeah .
so do you even love him ?
there' s different types of love .
i knew it !
sometimes you make rational decisions .
you can' t always follow your heart .
yeah , whatever .
i will admit there' s something sexy about a man who takes charge .
like you kidnapping me .
that took balls .
big balls .
i gotta say it turned me on .
it did ?
oh , my god .
goddamn these chains !
little key , little key .
what am i doing ?
i can' t let you go !
just give me one free hand .
it' il be worth it .
okay .
give me the fries .
hi .
wow .
hey .
shit .
just wait one minute , okay ?
dude ...
dude , you got a boner ?
no .
why didn' t you answer the door ?
i' m eating .
so ?
i don' t answer when i' m eating .
since when ?
since always .
i never knew that .
you didn' t know a lot , like i' m gay .
anything else you want to tell me ?
i got three balls .
shut up !
god !
dude .
hi , coach .
what are you doing here ?
retrial .
got a judge that' s a sports fan .
congrats .
what will you do now ?
that' s why i' m here .
need a place to crash , figure out my next move .
i knew i could count on you .
well , we gotta talk about ...
you stay as long as you like .
great !
where' s the bathroom ?
i gotta take a dump .
we don' t use the toilet anymore since we' re cutting down on the water bill .
what do you do ?
well , we just use the lawn now .
smart thinking .
oh , god !

i play croquet out there .

coach can' t stay here !
we got a woman locked in the garage !
oh , yeah !
you boys got any t. p. ?
no !
that' s all right .
i' il find something .
play it cool .
we' il find some way to get rid of him .
we tell him we got dates .
he can' t be here because we' re getting laid .
no , he' il never believe that .
we' il tell him we got ghosts .
so , boys , what' s for supper ?
listen , coach ...
we have ghosts .
we were thinking that maybe you staying here' s not such a great idea .
nonsense .
it' il give us a chance to get to know one another again .
so you boys take care of that bitch that was gonna marry silverman ?
yeah , we snuffed that bitch just like you said .
good .
how' d you do it ?
we ...
ate her .
you ate her ?
yeah .
we ate her .
alive .
my hat goes off to you .
you boys are smart .
that' s the perfect crime .
wonder what' s on the tube .
no !
coach !
no !
what the hell we got here ?
some kind of public access show ?
that' s the kidnap victim , ain' t it ?
you didn' t kill her !
no .
coach , listen ...
i am really disappointed in you boys .
i want you to go out there and off that cooze .
we can' t , coach .
oh , for pete' s sakes !
look !
she' s getting out !
go chop her head off or something .
there' s no fight left in you boys .
you' re nutless .
you been pussified .
don' t worry about a thing , boys .
i' il take care of that broad .
don' t worry !
who are you ?
let' s say i' m a friend of the boys , and i' m here to kill you .
you don' t mind if i try to defend myself , do you ?
of course not .
i love a good challenge .

i' m so happy .
oh , me too .

i' m gone for a week , and you' re screwing a nun ?
no , no .
we' re in love .
i thought you were dead .
oh , really ?
well , i' m not dead .
i was kidnapped , okay ?
it was hell !
i was beaten , tortured ... ... and treated like a frigging farm animal !
and the entire time ... ... the only thing that kept me alive was the thought ... ... that somewhere out there , my sweet darren still loved me ... ... and that one day we' d be together again .
it was so horrible .
where are we going ?
i don' t know .
we gotta find her .
okay , where to ?
go left !
i' m going right !
they kept me in a dark closet for days .
and they fed me , like , crushed potato chips under the door .
maybe i should go .
oh , no .
please .
please , don' t .
don' t leave .
well , but , i mean ... ... judith' s alive , and she is your fiance .
i know .
you' re right .
you' re right .
but ...
but you can' t go because i ...
because what ?
why , darren ?
because i ...
see , you ...
yeah ?
well , we ...
and ...
yeah ?
sweetheart , we pledged our love to one another .
spare her the pain of seeing us together .
you ... ... run along back to the nunnery .
she' s right .

she' s here !
hey , darren .
sandy , hi .

darren , look .
i understand that you' re really upset .
i probably look like a really big asshole ...
dude !
okay .
i deserved that .
but now let me explain ...
okay , i guess i deserved that one too , but now we' re even , okay ?

we only did it because we love you .
oh , right , because you love me .
yeah , man .

and a hooker .

oh , my gosh !
neil diamond !
what the hell is going on ?
neil , let me explain .
you' re the guys who send me all those letters and tapes .
naked pictures .
what ?
we never sent you any naked pictures .
dude .
sorry .
mr. diamond , you gotta help us save our buddy .
he' s marrying the wrong woman .
sandy and darren , they broke up .
love on the rocks .
ain' t no big surprise .
help us get them back together .
i don' t know .
turn on your heart light .
judith brainwashed him .
for years , darren loved me , but i never knew it .
hold it .
hold it !
hold on .
and did i mention i was gay ?
i' ve spent my life writing songs about the power of love ... ... but up until right now , they' ve only been words .
this may be my chance to prove that those words really mean something .
you say that if darren marries ...
judith . ... judith , he' il be miserable .
right .
i believe in happy endings .
if neil diamond has anything to do with it ... ... this love story will have one .
come on !
yeah !
we got neil diamond onboard !
all right !
where we going ?
the park on america avenue .
5 0 !
what ?
cops .
caprice .
five cars back .
goddamn heat .
one little prison break , and they' re all over you .
whoa , coach .
no matter what happens , don' t look back .
just get this sweet gal to the man who loves her .
i' d rather be cut down in a hail of gunfire than to go back to jail .
nice meeting you , mr. diamond .
coach , look out !
they' re not cops !
hey , we' re coming to america .
dearly beloved , we are gathered here today to join darren silverman ... ... and judith fessbeggler in holy matrimony .
if anyone has any objections , speak now .
i do .
what ?
neil ?
neil !
neil .
get to the part where we say , " i do .
oh , my !
say , " i do .
no .
say , " i do .
i can' t .
because i ...
... i love neil ... ... and i love sandy .
you' re in love with this slut ?
i am not a slut .
sandy is my one and only someone .
what about me ?
who' s my someone ?
you ruined my life !
but i saved darren' s !
just because i lost darren doesn' t mean i' m crazy enough ... ... to hook up with you !
why can' t you just admit that when you kissed me , you liked it ?
you' re right .
i have a weakness for incompetent morons .
admit it !
i' m the strong willed , assertive man that you need ... ... and you' re the hard core bitch that i' ve always dreamed of .
what about you ?
when are you gonna get hitched ?
actually , i' m not .
i' m gay .
me too .
really ?
by the power vested in me by the state of washington ... ... i now pronounce you man and wife .
you may kiss the bride .
i now pronounce you man and wife .
you may kiss the bride .
i now pronounce you man and man .
you may kiss the man .
come on , we need you for this one .
