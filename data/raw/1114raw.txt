some fairy tales are true .
most other stories we make up to help us deal with real life .
it all depends on your point of view , but here are the facts .
there was once a princess who lived in a castle high above the streets of an enchanted kingdom .
the king and queen were long gone , but they left her with their treasure so that she could stay a princess forever .
on the eve of her 22nd birthday , a great celebration was planned .

you' re the greatest , tony !
molly ?
hey , ingrid , it' s me .
where the hell are you ?
i' m sorry , i passed out .
i was watching tv .
that was a premeditated nap .
you did this to me on purpose .
you' re my best friend in the whole universe .
how could you possibly think a thing like this ?
it' s like stabbing me in the heart .
thank you !
forget it , okay ?
i didn' t want to tell you , but our little night out has grown .
huey and i are here with a few of your closest friends waiting to wish you a ...
happy birthday ?
happy birthday .
i tried calling you from home .
the girly to end all girlies is in the house .
happy birthday , molly .

you did , i thought it was gonna be just us guys going out .
hell , no !
what kind of friends you think we are ?
look at this .
this here is a party , right ?
you' re 22 ?
i just turned 19 and i thought i' d kill myself .
you look good , though .
buy you a drink ?
no , thanks .
i wanna connect the dots , baby .
look at the babes , molly ,
they' re , like , beautiful and natural and sexy , right ?
beauty like that is universal .
they really do look young , huh ?
the thing i love about women is that you are willing to accept each other for who you are .
there you are , sweetie .
you remember julie and holly from the moma junior committee ?
happy birthday .
i love your solid hair scrunchy .
thanks .
issey miyake ?
home depot .
you can get botox injections for that forehead wrinkle .
face factory .
no appointment necessary .
why would i have a worry wrinkle ?
why would you think anyone would care ?
excuse me ?
i had shoes like yours once , when i was five .
that was what , like three days ago ?
try three years .
excuse me , thumbelina , but you' re still a little underage to be clubbing , aren' t you ?
you' re a little overage to be wearing a lampshade in your hair .
bright idea ?
you brought your own personal soap ?
you want to pick up bacterial meningitis or polio , you go ahead and be my guest .
whatever diseases you' re already carrying probably make those sound like a joke , anyway .
there you are .
i finally found your little monster butt .
come here !
i know you have trouble reading something as simple as a sign on the door , gooey huey . so let me help you ,
this is the ladies ' room .
really ?
what' s your excuse ?
give me my purse .
my boss ' kid .
they can' t keep a nanny .
they fired their third one this month today .
she had dirty fingernails .
it was her or me .
that hurts .
where' s my purse ?
in my hand .
ing , am i hideous ?
what ?
as my best friend , it is your duty not to lie to me .
please tell me , am i turning into a hideous hag ?
you can have any guy here with the snap of a finger .
what' s gotten into you ?
oh , my god .
molly , let me show you something .
come here ,
sit down .
great , you again .
i want to thank you all for having me here .
i' ve heard there' s a birthday tonight .
where' s that birthday girl ?
all right .
this one' s for you .
the lights beam down from the stars
and it takes my breath away
and the tears of glee in my heart
end up voicing words to say
all i feel is invested in this ...
oh , my god .
who is that ?
that' s my boy neal fox ,
i found him playing at a dive in the village .
he' s smokin ' .
can i have him for my birthday ?
no , molly , i brought him here so roma could check him out .
besides , he' s 100 % girly free .
he' s celibate , like morrissey .
he' s all about the music .
you wouldn' t know real music if mozart hit you on the head .
quiet , the both of you .
quiet ?
this place is so loud , it is giving me a migraine .
my call of love
then she' il rise with love ...
mom !
no , your mom' s over there talkin ' to my man nas .
we been tryin ' to sign him for months .
could you please keep it down ?
mom , i wanna go home now !
night , molls .
bye .
good night , molly !
bye !
i finished my new record and ...
that' s great , duncan .
nice to see you .
where is he ? ... give me your two cents .
huey said this guy is practically a monk .
what the hell are you trying to prove ?
the only reason you' re looking at this guy is because you can' t have him .
he' s a rock ' n ' roll poet sex god .
you' il toss him in a week .
no , ing , this one' s different .
i can feel it .
that was good .
kid , i haven' t heard blue eyed soul like that since jeff buckley' s record .
see what i' m sayin ' ?
what did i tell you , roma ?
he' s smokin ' , right ?
you did good , huey .
i need eight hours , mom .
if i don' t get eight hours , my immune system crashes ,
record something more up tempo i can get on the radio .
let' s go .
work it out with huey .
go ...
that' s what i' m talkin ' about .
she gets it .
i get it .
you don' t get it .
wait ...
neal , you need to get it .
i think we got ourselves a grammy !
i hate that ...
kids !
always hogging your attention .
hi .
hi , birthday girl .
yeah , happy birthday .
thank you .
is this demo thing for real ?
she' s about to sign you !
i can feel it in my bones .
rocket to the moon , baby .
rocket to the moon .
oh , my .
are you really tommy gunn' s daughter ?
seriously ?
can you hold my purse , please ?
yeah .
thanks .
jesus !
i guess there is a certain family resemblance .
his guitars are in there ?
you wanna come see ?
yeah .
can you just wait here just one second , please ?
thank you .
yeah .
right .
welcome to le chteau chez molly .
nice .
what on god' s earth is that ?
mu .
don' t you mean oink ?
no , " mu " means " pork " in thai .
he was going to be my curry diner one night in bangkok , but we fell in love .
if you wait here ,
i will fix us some bonbonnires confiseries .
oh , my god .
looks like you found it on your own .
i can' t believe it !
this is it .
this is the acoustic muddy waters gave tommy gunn .
he played it at budokan .
summer of ' 88 .
daddy' s little girl
that' s you .
paints the world with her magic wand
please don' t sing that song .
molly smiles .
he opened the show with it .
for me
and then he and my mom died .
listen , i didn' t mean to ...
okay .
yeah .
so what' s next ?
how about dessert ?
am i gonna be able to pronounce it ?
i don' t know .
can you say ... " pez " ?
i' m just not supposed to act impulsively , you know ?
part of my whole sobriety thing .
made a vow , haven' t broken it yet .
pez .
i haven' t had a drink in 224 days .
i' m also not supposed to have romantic relationships my first year .
pez .
it' s called the law of contrary behavior .
if i want a drink , i don' t have one .
if i want to skip a gig , i force myself to go .
if i meet a girl and i want her to come over ...
i send her home .
pez .
those are vows i haven' t broken .
ships crossing like ghosts in the night
night names , unremembered faces in sight
took what we can in need to survive
oh , my god , i love it !
it' s the most lyrically advanced thing i' ve done .
no , purple means rock ' n ' roll royalty , and it picks up the highlights in your eyes .
you' re too hot for those earth tones you' ve been wearing .
what about the song ?
is it too fast , too slow , what ?
it' s kind of like the same thing over and over again .
is there , like , a hook or a good chorus or something ?
a hook ?
yeah .
i don' t do hooks .
okay .
i' m not a sell out .
i don' t wear purple and i don' t do hooks .
i said okay , okay ?
names ... names unremembered , faces in sight
molly , i thought you were dead .
neal' s in the other room .
that guy is still there ?
you always do this .
when are you gonna grow up ?
he' s never going to leave .
all he does is mope and play these loser songs .
help me , please .
i don' t know how to get rid of this guy without breaking his heart .
hold .
just a minute !
oh , my god , i' m being totally suffocated .
yeah ?
can you take those off ?
ing , i' il call you .
baby ...
i' m not a love machine .
no , my boxers ... can i have them back , please ?
thanks .
what' s going on ?
listen , i' ve got to go .
go ?
go where , go ?
home , molly .
the place where i live , where i have a life , where i do my laundry , get sleep , try to make music .
why can' t you make music here ?
this is a world gone mad ,
like i' ve stepped through the looking glass .
there' s a week' s worth of leftovers , a month of laundry .
look at this place .
we' il call maid service .
you call maid service .
i' ve got to rejoin the human race .
no !
i don' t understand .
listen , i just feel like i' m suffocating .
i need some air .
we can open the windows .
it' s not about the windows .
i need my shirt back .
damn !
i forgot to get new strings .
i have , like , five gigs this week and i have not done a single thing .
i have got to get to work .
i' il call you later , i swear .
oh , my god .
this place is beyond its normal grotesque .
it' s post nuclear .
ninety eight messages ?
molly , your machine has 98 messages on it .
write them down for me , will you ?
he' s gone .
i have no life .
what ?
of course you have a life .
i don' t need to tell you that .
that' s what you' re supposed to say to me .
sorry .
as your best friend , it' s my duty not to lie to you .
besides , you wanted him gone , remember ?
i did ?
what are all these final notices ?
i' m gonna call him .
i think now is a good time to call him .
would you hand me the phone ?
i' m gonna call him right now .
focus for one second .
your electric has been canceled and so has your gas .
who pays your bills ?
bob .
bob who ?
i don' t know .
my parents ' guy bob .
your phone' s dead .
these rooms ... sound so empty without the sound of his music .
bob' s number has been disconnected .
oh , god .
i' m sure it' s little consolation , but you' re not the only one who got taken , miss gunn .
bob kopalski had ten clients , assets equaling over $100 million , when he disappeared .
you' re telling us that none of it' s insured ?
what a disaster .
thank god for the residuals .
actually , kopalski took such heavy advances on the royalty income that by the time the account recoups .
miss gunn will be on social security .
where does someone disappear with $100 million ?
the best we can guess is south america .
can' t you just sue ?
my god , how could he do this to her ?
he' il be back .
they always come back .
if he does , he' il be looking out the back of an fbi van on his way to a long prison term .
it' il be years before you see a dime , if ever .
mr , feldman , as a lawyer , may i please ask your advice as per what to do in the meantime as far as , you know , money ?
get a job ?
dear prospective employer ,
although i' ve had no previous employment , ever ,
the following is a partial but significant list of personal recommendations , including contact information .
the dalai lama , tibet ?
900 thread count egyptian cotton .
no man can resist egyptian cotton .
tibet is a country , molly , not contact information .
why not add " earth " in case someone needs to know where tibet is ?
this is not a rsum .
it shows i' m a people person .
focus on the interview .
hello .
pleasure to meet you .
i will work overtime , weekends , holidays , yom kippur , christmas .
you name it , i will be here .
i' m sure that won' t be necessary .
ingrid says you guys met at darlington ?
i was valedictorian there two years in a row .
that' s so neat .
tell me , what is the price on a set of these ? $1, 369 plus tax .
you' re in denial .
you' re broke , remember ?
trish , hon , tell me , do employees get a discount around here ?
ten percent , and some employees are among our best customers .
i' il take them .
ing , this is the greatest job ever .
who is it ?
it' s molly !
i was just out shopping in the neighborhood .
at midnight ?
it' s the city that never sleeps .
you can' t do this .
i have to be at the studio at 9 : 00 .
i can' t act like a kid anymore .
really ?
neal , i haven' t seen sheets like this since the third grade .
rocket ships ?
you wouldn' t have my jacket in there ?
it' s like my lucky jacket .
i never get onstage without it .
i left it behind the other day .
no .
i guess you' re gonna have to come over and look for it .
i can' t disappear from the world again .
i can' t lose myself in this obsessive compulsive irrational behavior .
feel .
excuse me ?
feel .
egyptian cotton ...
900 thread count .
all right , i' il tell you what .
maybe we can , like , date , okay ?
okay .
but it' s gonna have to be a mature adult relationship with ... alarm clocks in the morning ...
i love alarm clocks . and work during the day .
we eat with silverware , knives and forks ... drink out of glasses ... do the dishes .
is it bedtime yet ?
molly , wake up .
i' m sorry .
it' s not going to work out .
you spent all night at that guy' s house doing god knows what , then you come here and crash at work .
i can' t believe you did this to me after all the strings i pulled .
i know that i' m an undeserving creep , but can we please talk about it over lunch ?
no !
our lunch date is canceled .
you can' t afford lunch .
fine , see if i care .
i' il live off of water and sunshine .
you won' t have to .
once again your main man is gonna come through for ya .
you' re gonna get me a record deal .
not exactly .
hi !
oh , my god .
you' re my new nanny ?
hi , laraine .
it' s ray .
nobody calls me laraine .
okay , ray , i' m molly .
we met at my birthday party , remember ?
you' re late .
by , like , a second .
by three and a half minutes .
i have to take my aciphex by 4 : 26 , and it' s ... 4 : 18 right now ,
we' il take it when we get home .
that' s when i take my colitin .
the agency must really be getting desperate .
i actually am uniquely qualified for this position , having spent so many years developing my skills as a people person .
mission accomplished ?
fruit punch ?
why don' t you just drink cyanide ?
at least it' s quick .
damn .
hang your coat up in there .
what is this , the shining ?
who is that ?
nobody .
what' s wrong with him ?
none of your b i business .
shoes !
this is your room ?
there' s no fooling you , is there ?
it' s so ...
orderly .
these are so neat !
i remember when there were only four models .
i can' t believe this .
she' s beautiful .
look at these legs .
that' s pliing polly .
put her back !
how cool is this ?
look at this little tea set !
you don' t touch that unless i happen to invite you to tea .
look at these cute little scones .
get away from there .
well , i say , lady sassafras , would you like some crme frache to go with your darling pastries ?
you just got your germy drool over my plastic scone , you freako .
kid , have you ever been to a shrink ?
since i was three .
what ?
good afternoon , miss ray .
dinner is ready .
there' s just nothing like good help .
you missed a spot .
isn' t doing the dishes what the maid is supposed to be for ?
she doesn' t know how to dry without leaving spots .
you don' t know how to dry without destroying the environment .
for every roll of paper towels you waste , a tree in the rain forest dies .
i' m gonna die of botulism from the germs on that gunky towel , you tree loving hippie .
at least i don' t prefer tofu to normal hamburgers .
i' m not the one who' s gonna get mad cow disease and go nuts , though you don' t seem to have a brain to fry in the first place .
maybe not , but at least i' m not holding the germ infested towel .
give me that plate .
no , sorry .
you might infect it .
why don' t you get your plastic baggie and dig up some penicillin ?
no !
come on .
give me the plate !
you want it ?
how bad do you want it ?
get a broom .
you get a frickin ' broom .
when you work for me , you leave when i say you can leave .
for your information , i do not work for you .
i am employed by your mother .
yeah ?
take a look around .
do you see her anywhere ?
news flash ... you' re not gonna unless you make an appointment with her assistant or hang around her bedroom door at 3 : 00 in the morning .
in the meantime , you' re workin ' for me .
is that so ?
news flash , mussolini ...
i quit !
are you all right , miss gunn ?
just great .
baby !
baby , what are you doing outside all by yourself ?
how did you get locked out ?
mama' s had a day .
i' ve lived here for 20 years .
how can you do this ?
aside from that ...
this is a family building , miss gunn .
i suggest you find somewhere you' d be more welcome .
like los angeles .
you will be allowed back into your apartment only so long as you are accompanied by a management representative and only long enough to gather your belongings .
that is , those personal belongings we don' t insist on holding as collateral for the rent and utilities you owe .
you are otherwise barred from the premises .
i know this is a big change for you , but it' il feel like home in no time at all .
this is the bedroom ... my bedroom , of course ... but there' s plenty of drawer space if you need it .
i can' t believe those creeps would throw a destitute woman into the street .
chivalry is so dead .
this is the bathroom .
i hung up your towels for you .
i' ve been here a thousand times .
you know the kitchen .
julie and holly come over thursdays for our weekly bake fest .
mondays , penny and ethel come so we can do yoga with rajiiv right here in the living room .
but this is going to be a problem .
ing , don' t you think it' s weird that neal hasn' t called me ?
no , but i think it' s weird that you' re wearing his jacket .
i told you just bring the essentials , molly .
you can' t keep all this stuff .
and he definitely has to go .
mu , what are we gonna do ?
downsize , molly .
purify .
streamline , find your center ,
you' re right , ing .
we' re gonna get you the best housewarming present ever .
don' t be silly .
it' s gonna be hard enough on you coming up with half the rent .
wonderful , girls .
tomorrow we start rehearsing for next month' s recital , but i think we still have five minutes .
how about a little freestyle ?
you sure looked great out there .
i just , you know ...
yelling at you the other day and all ...
i' m sorry .
what are you doing here ?
i called roma , your mom ... and she said that if you said that it was okay .
i could have my job back ?
you' re on probation .
act your age , not your shoe size .
how come you left dance class so early ?
that freestyle at the end looked like so much fun .
freestyle is for moronic little kids and hippie freaks .
it' s fun .
fundamentals are the building blocks of fun .
says who ?
mikhail baryshnikov , who i' m sure you' ve never heard of .
ballet is about precision , discipline , and poise .
they made us take ballet at darlington .
i couldn' t wait to get out there and make up all my own moves .
figures .
such a sloppy doofus .
figures .
you' re such a pill popping little tyrant .
don' t ever do that to me again .
you' re hurting me .
you hurt me .
take it back .
take it back .
fine .
i take it back .
it' s a good thing you did .
otherwise you wouldn' t have gotten your surprise .
surprise .
i really hate surprises , and i sincerely doubt there' s anything you could give me that i don' t already have .
there' s no harm in trying , is there ?
ray , are you all right ?
my glands are swollen .
i' m having an allergic reaction .
my immune system is crashing .
mu stayed with you one measly little night .
come on .
and that' s all he' s gonna be staying .
wasn' t it fun , though , sneaking him in and out for his walk ?
it was like a real , live adventure .
you know you had fun .
i' m not a swineherd , kook .
excuse me .
how much is this putter ?
this putter is not for sale .
sorry .
this is a mistake .
you don' t golf .
tiger gave this to me .
essentials , remember ?
you' ve got to get rid of this junk .
it' s essential .
twenty dollars .
ten .
sold .
can i talk to you for a second ?
come through here .
do me a favor , all right ?
watch your step .
this is kelli .
kelli , this is molly .
pleasure to meet you .
looks almost as good on her as it does on you , doesn' t it ?
gooey !
looks like mu isn' t the only pig you hang out with .
go away !
it must be really hard getting rid of all this neat stuff .
no , i' m actually loving it .
really ?
it' s very refreshing .
everybody , once in their life , should do this and slough off all the bad ...
wait !
sorry , this is ... mine .
no , i just bought it .
how much did you pay ?
thirty dollars .
my friend rosella gave it to me .
i' il give you 50 , 75 !
enough !
we' re downsizing , remember ?
sloughing off the excess to find our center .
you want this , molly .
close your eyes and repeat after me .
i want this .
miss gunn ?
we' re ready to pack this room up for storage , ma' am .
can i have just five more minutes , please ?
okay , sure .
thank you .
is that you ?
dad' s a rock star ?
was .
he' s dead .
bet this stuff is worth a bundle .
i can' t just sell it , ray .
it' s my parents ' stuff .
no , you' re gonna box it up so it can lay in storage gathering dust .
god , you' re pathetic .
that man in the library in your house ... nurse said he' s in a coma from a massive stroke .
that' s your father , huh ?
was .
he' s a vegetable now .
soon he' il be nothing .
that' s kind of harsh .
it' s a harsh world .
watch where you' re going !
neal , i really hate talking to your machine .
where are you ?
i' m still holding on to your jacket for you .
i know you' ve been going crazy trying to reach me , but i' ve been in a transition right now .
i' m , like , miss proletariat now .
mop the floors , spank the brat , pick up the paycheck on friday .
i am a woman .
how about you ?
shit !
get under the tail .
i' m not putting my hand under his heinie .
do you want him to stay here or not ?
oh , god !
oh , my god !
i' il get him !
very good .
now come out of plough .
very nice .
breathing .
good .
pull up under .
very nice .
molly , out of plough .
come on , molly .
let' s go .
could you please help me ?
this is starting to hurt .
oh , my god .
73 ... beautiful , 74 , 75 ... very good .
76 , 77 ...
let me put a few more on .
ing , here we go .
waist .
molly , you get to be in charge of the chocolate chip cookies .
they' re already mixed , so all you have to do is put them in the oven and time them .
salmonella .
you' re letting her do this ?
relax , girls .
it' s just cookie mix .
how badly can she screw it up ?
put it out now !
put it out !
i' m trying !
oh , gosh !
this is neal' s jacket !
put it out !
get it out !
take it back !
oh , my god !
take it back now !
what are you doing , ray ?
have you gone mad ?
there is never , ever an excuse for hitting another person .
what' s going on ?
she was laughing at me because her " au pair " said that my new nanny was a slutbag whore .
go !
i' m sorry .
sorry .
you' ve reached ingrid .
please leave your number and the time of your call .
be specific .
hi , it' s neal calling for molly .
i hope this is the right number .
i love ingrid with all my heart and all her cute martha stewart wannabe friends , but it' s a real estrogen fest over there .
a girl needs a testosterone injection every once in a while .
not that i think of you that way .
you' re super sensitive .
don' t be a silly goose .
please let me patronize the arts .
well , actually ...
i just signed a deal with schleine records .
oh , my god .
what ?
oh , my god !
neal , that' s incredible !
that' s amazing !
why didn' t you say anything ?
i would have , but this is the first time tonight
i' ve managed to get a word in edgewise .
i ...
so how did you seal the deal ?
i know this one , this is the deep one ,
i guess i looked deep down inside and ... found that inner hook ,
you certainly did ... ... and that calls for ... ... an outer hook to go with it ,
what' s that ?
your lucky jacket .
my lucky ...
what have you done to it ?
a few minor improvements .
improvements ?
yeah .
you mutilated it !
no , i fixed it .
look how great this is .
i told you purple was your magic color .
we have to talk .
those are the four most hateful words in english .
i can' t see you anymore .
i' m sorry about the jacket .
it' s not about the jacket .
i just can' t see you .
that' s all .
right .
you just do the rock star' s daughter so you can tell your pop star wannabe mates , then ride off into the sunset with your crummy guitar ...
it' s not like that .
i' m just not in a place ...
ray , can you turn that down , please ?
thank you .
you' re supposed to put the cream in before the sugar .
i' m not having cream .
i can' t gain weight .
my ballet recital is friday night , remember ?
right .
i remember .
i invited you to afternoon tea .
the least you can do is be polite .
why are you buttering my plastic scone ?
why are plastic scones on the table when we have real food ?
you thought they were cute .
are you still moping over that disgusting guy ?
other people always let you down .
why don' t you forget them and do something for yourself ?
like what ?
i don' t know .
something you' re good at .
and i don' t mean shopping .
maybe some of us aren' t good at anything .
every grownup is good at something .
my bad .
i don' t see any grownups around here .
what' s so great about being a grownup anyway ?
so i can turn out like you ?
you' re scared .
sometimes when mu hears people walking by outside the door , he gets this funny expression and runs into the bathroom ,
like he thinks they' re coming to get him .
that' s how you look .
where are you going ?
if you refuse to have a nice time with me ,
i' m going to have fun by myself .
two hundred plis isn' t fun , ray .
it' s slave labor .
fundamentals are the building blocks of fun .
right .
i forgot .
what is with this music , anyway ?
it' s like a soundtrack to slit your wrists to .
it happens to be mozart .
it happens to be depressing .
if we' re gonna have fun , we need to listen to music that' s fun .
i hate to break it to you , but this junk is not music !
but it sure is fun to dance to !
cut it out !
you look like a spastic hyena !
what are you doing ?
what is your problem ?
let me go !
what are you doing ?
grow up .
where are you going now ?
i have about a million last minute errands to run and a date with this normal adult guy i met .
he' s in computers .
ing , i am so sick of all of these rock ' n ' rollers , overpaid jocks , and supermodel bitch boys .
you know , i thought maybe , just maybe , you' d remember we had plans tonight .
green tea tasting at the asia society , remember ?
if i never have a drop of tea again , it would be too soon .
please , go without me .
you' il have fun , ing .
i' m already a half hour late .
we were supposed to go together .
i rsvp' d over a month ago .
it' s too late to invite anyone else .
we' re roomies , ing .
that' s why i pay half the rent .
it doesn' t mean i owe you every minute of my free time .
owe me ?
you mean , for free yoga or nearly burning down my apartment ?
owe me ?
is that what you think of our friendship ?
only because you think friendship is having total control over my life .
unfortunately , you don' t know how to run your life , molly .
fortunately , that' s not your problem .
not anymore .
look at you .
you got rollers in your hair .
is that your new style ?
i forgot .
i was in a hurry .
just playing .
come here .
huey , my suitcases .
my bad .
your room is that way .
put your bags in there .
i got your bed made up .
sorry .
i' m sorry .
it' s okay .
okay .
thank you for taking me in like this .
don' t even trip .
we all know ingrid can be a little anal .
it' s all good .
besides ...
life with huey is one big party .
party time !
that' s what i' m talkin ' about .
your turn .
bravo !
beautiful ,
lovely .
yeah !
molly , no !
hi , roma .
it' s me ...
molly .
ray' s nanny ?
yes , of course .
i was at your birthday party .
yeah .
i' m a fan of your father' s .
he had that one song ...
what was it ?
with your name in it .
yes .
i was just wondering , ' cause it' s my night off ... who' s watching ray ?
she' s at some ballet thing or other ,
oh , god .
it' s her recital ?
i have to get over there .
i' m sure it' s over by now .
i' ve arranged to have a car pick her up , okay ?
excuse me for a moment .
i' m sorry .
go ahead .
rise and shine , ophelia .
hello , my little sugar pie .
how you doin ' ?
isn' t it your day off ?
indeed it is .
and it' s yours , too .
no school , no homework , and especially no fatal illnesses .
let me see this .
look at this .
perfect 98 . 6 , only 20 degrees above the temperature of the beautiful day awaiting us .
i' m not going anywhere , especially with you .
oh , yes , you are .
we are going to sit in giant teacups and spin round and round in circles until we puke .
are you on crack ?
we' re gonna have fun .
i can' t believe i let you talk me into this .
you are gonna so love coney island , ray .
giant teacups you sit in .
it' s a ride , ray , like the ones at disneyland .
haven' t you ever been to disneyland ?
you' ve never been to disneyland ?
why don' t you alert the media ?
haven' t you ever been to an amusement park ... ever ?
oh , my god !
ray , you are so psyched !
whatever !
say it , ray .
say , " i am so psyched .
i' m psyched , okay ?
then you' re gonna have to pay the toll .
it' s like passing through the gates before you can get into the emerald city .
let me go .
are you trying to murder me ?
you have to eat one , or they' re not gonna let you in .
they' re toxic , you maniac .
they have dead rats and nitrates .
do you want to ride the spinning teacups or not ?
now swallow .
swallow .
wait .
she' s alive .
she' s alive !
the operation was a success , ladies and gentlemen !
she' s alive !
excuse me .
why is it so dead around here ?
the rides don' t run till the season starts .
the season ?
you' re a week early .
thanks .
let' s go home .
the last time i saw my mom and dad , i was eight going on nine ... eight years , six months , and three days , almost as old as you are .
they were going on tour , leaving me behind for the first time .
they didn' t want me missing any more school .
when they came to my room to say good bye .
i wouldn' t open the door , so they left .
i fell asleep .
the next thing i knew ... my nanny was waking me up in the middle of the night telling me their plane had crashed .
you' re lucky .
lucky ?
that you were mad .
when you' re mad , you don' t miss people , and if you stay mad , it' s like you never knew them at all .
that way you don' t have to feel sucky about it .
you were lucky .
night .
i wasn' t mad , ray .
i was confused .
everyone was talking to me , and i couldn' t understand a word they were saying .
then their voices became a blur ... and soon i couldn' t even recognize their faces .
they were like these blobs .
then they started to grow fangs ... and their eyes became green .
i knew i had to run away .
i packed my knapsack , got on the train , looked up at the map , and decided that i wanted to live in coney island .
i thought it was gonna be a real island ... and i could hide away there like tom sawyer and huckleberry finn .
imagine my surprise .
the teacups was the only ride they' d let me on by myself .
i got on it and started spinning myself round and round .
i feel like i' m still there , spinning round and round and round , and the ride won' t stop , and i won' t dare get off .
you were right , ray .
i am scared .
but you' re scared , too .
you' re as scared as i am . and i thought maybe ...
i thought maybe if we ... could go together ...
morning , cutie .
you hungry ?
you' re up a little early .
what are you doing here ?
i happen to work here .
what are you doing ?
don' t forget the sugar , sugar !
just breathe .
lady !
lady , that water is contaminated , you know .
you better get out of there .
that' s pure sewage you' re in , there .
did you hear me ?
did you hear me ?
yeah , i heard you !
that water' s filthy !
if you don' t get out .
i' il call the police .
i' m getting out .
a hundred and one degrees .
sick as a dog .
you better hope you don' t get radiation poisoning from that toxic pond scum .
take two echinacea and a benadryl for your sinuses .
okay .
call me if you need anything else .
stay here , mu .
where are you going ?
i don' t know .
maybe the library .
is that where you went last night ?
i' m not gonna bother him .
i' m just gonna sit quietly and read or something .
you can read out loud .
i think he might like that .
he' s a vegetable , molly .
chatting it up with my dad isn' t gonna do anyone any good at all .
you' re the doctor .
it' s not gonna do any good .
i saw this show once on tv about all these sick people .
the ones where their friends and families talked to them held on ten times longer than the ones left all alone , and that is a fact .
do you swear ?
i swear .
pinky promise ?
don' t touch .
germs .
sorry .
germs .
right .
wanna come ?
can i help you with something ?
she' s going to go talk to him for a little while .
you know ... privately ?
i can' t think of what to say .
there' s an all time first .
hey , dad .
i know i haven' t ...
well , what i really wanted to tell you was about my new pet .
it' s really molly' s , my nanny , but the thing is , it' s a pig ... literally .
his name is mu .
he' s from thailand .
he' s really clean , i have to admit , even if he is a pig .
anyway , what i' m really into these days is ballet .
you and mom used to say that it was old fashioned , but i swear it' s really cool .
i' m already doing changements and chanes ... you know , when you spin and spin and spin ,
it used to make me dizzy .
now i' m only dizzy when i stop .
what a one hit wonder that slut turned out to be .
it' s his first single .
it just dropped .
it' s been playing in my head for weeks , and it sucks .
what is this ?
this is so ' 80s it makes my hair pouf .
hold up .
listen .
i produced this video , and the ' 80s are back .
i don' t know where you' ve been .
listening to tchaikovsky , mozart , and chopin .
you wouldn' t know real music if i hit you on the head with it , gooey .
you' re gonna stop calling me gooey .
so ?
what do you think ?
what is it ?
it' s a tutu , silly .
for what , a midget ?
no , for a little girl named ray .
her year end dance recital is coming up .
the costumes are so boring , i figured i' d surprise her with something pretty spectacular .
he' s wearing the jacket !
that' s my jacket !
i made that jacket !
that was my idea !
he is the lizard king reincarnated .
no , listen to me .
look at me .
i' m the lizard king .
this guy , he' s nothing but an illusion .
he ain' t real .
everything he is , i made .
you want real , you want substance ,
look no further than what you got in front of you .
i' m the lizard king ,
you' re right , huey .
true friends , true hearts .
that is what counts in life .
that' s right .
hit me one .
give me some love .
that' s funny .
i wasn' t expecting anyone .
go see who it is .
hey , man .
what' s going on ?
hi , 81st and 5th , please .
when did it happen ?
he passed away this afternoon .
i' m so sorry .
you promised .
miss gunn , mrs. schleine is waiting for you in the study .
i' m so sorry , mrs. schleine .
thanks for coming , miss gunn .
are you kidding ?
nothing could keep me away at a time like this .
last week' s pay and a month' s severance .
severance ?
we' re letting you go .
we " ?
that' s right .
me and ray .
we .
good night , miss gunn .
i' m sorry , but i' m not leaving without an explanation .
i don' t know what' s been going on between you and my daughter , but she has made it clear she never wants to see you again .
she must be going out of her mind with grief .
actually , she' s taking it rather well .
i was at my staff meeting when i got the news about my husband .
i came home to find ray finishing her homework .
she' s been very calm and level headed about this whole affair .
you call that taking it well ?
do you know what tage your daughter' s at in ballet ?
or that she was banned from her science class for stealing a formaldehyde pig so she could give it a proper burial ?
the tea set you got her ... it' s exquisite and beautiful , but do you know how she likes to have her tea , how many lumps ... one , two ... cream , sugar ?
and the point of your little tirade is ...
you' re right .
you don' t know what goes on between me and ray because you don' t know very much about your own daughter .
i know my daughter well enough to respect her wishes .
you don' t give her respect .
you give her whatever she asks for so you don' t have to deal with her .
she' s eight years old .
she is not 28 .
please remember that the next time you show her some " respect .
it' s my muse .
getting in your way again .
molly , i came here to see you .
for what ?
i haven' t been able to write a single decent song since we last saw each other .
molly , i' m sorry .
i was trying to take a step forward , but i took two steps backward instead .
why don' t you take one step sideways ?
then we can stop doing this silly little dance .
so that' s the molly m. o.
when i' m not ready , you hunt me down .
when i try and make it work , you' re not interested .
ever since we met , it' s about what i' m doing wrong ... but i' m not the one with the problem .
you are , you and your selfishness .
all you do is take .
i' ve got nothing for you right now , so ... maybe it' s time to start thinking about someone other than yourself .
till then ...
good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
now we' il start the bidding on this important collection representing a vital chapter in american musical history .
tommy gunn was an essential member of several landmark bands .
he scored a solo hit with " molly smiles " ...
maybe we should wait a few minutes till everyone shows up .
i' m afraid this is about as good as it' s going to get .
we have here tommy gunn' s signature acoustic , which he played with his first band in haight ashbury .
bidding starts at $2, 500 .
do i hear $2, 500 ?
2, 500 .
i have $2, 500 .
do i hear $2, 600 ?
2, 500 ?
2, 600 .
thank you .
2, 500 ?
i' m sorry .
we put out feelers , but unfortunately the excitement generated by mr. gunn' s memorabilia fell somewhat short of expectations .
i have 3, 000 .
3, 000 going once , 3, 000 going twice ... 75, 000 !
i have an offer of 75, 000 ... from a buyer who wishes to remain anonymous ... for the entire collection .
well ?
what do you say ?
it' s up to you .
frankly , i can' t envision a much better result from selling it off piecemeal .
this is everything that he' s left behind in the whole world .
this is my dad .
i' m sorry .
just get rid of it .
molly , where are you taking me ?
the fellas are waiting for us at the club .
the fellas can wait , huey .
this is important .
hold up .
molly , please .
they better have a defibrillator up there .
gooey , suck it up .
it' s good for your heinie .
welcome to le chteau chez molly .
this is ...
it' s my new apartment .
this way is the kitchen area , and over here in this direction , you' il find the very private , secluded bathroom section .
fabulous , huh ?
you' re standing in the living room , which , coincidentally , happens to be ... the bedroom .
it' s got potential , huh ?
as a detention cell for convicted felons , maybe .
molly , this isn' t you .
i can' t afford me anymore , huey .
nobody' s kicking you out .
you can still stay with me .
i really have to stand on my own two feet right now , okay ?
okay .
hello ?
roma , how would i know where ray is ?
what' s going on with ray ?
hold on one second .
thanks .
roma ?
hi .
it' s molly .
miss gunn , i know that you' ve been let go , but is there any chance that you' ve seen my daughter today ?
are you sure ?
ray didn' t come home from school .
she' s been missing ever since .
i thought that she might have ...
if you hear from her , please let me know .
huey , talk to her .
you all right ?
i' m fine , thanks .
it' s nice to see you again .
you , too .
i really miss you .
i miss you .
these are crummy circumstances .
molly gunn ?
yeah .
how you doin ' ?
good .
good to meet you .
same here .
i saw that kid neal fox' s video .
didn' t you create his look ?
no , i just fixed his jacket .
i don' t know why everybody' s talking about it .
do you do pants , too ?
cool leather ones that aren' t over the top ?
i' m hoping you can hook me up with a jacket .
not the same one , obviously , but with a similar vibe .
guys , thank you .
you' re very sweet .
it was sort of a big accident , yeah .
it' s a hell of an accident .
what do you think ?
i would love to .
cool .
done .
pants , too .
guys , garth brooks wants to meet you .
you' re kidding .
he' s over there .
excuse us .
mr. brooks ?
okay .
yeah .
let' s go .
awesome .
thanks .
no , that' s yours .
molly , i just spoke with her .
she' s almost ready to meet with people , but she wants to talk to you first .
you can have your job back , you know .
i don' t think so .
you and i ... we' re gonna be friends .
okay ?
grownups never stay friends with kids .
i don' t see any grownups around here .
i do .
you know the dalai lama ?
i' ve always thought of myself as a people person .
most fashion institute applicants would kill for references like yours .
seems to me you could skip school and find work with one of your designer friends .
it would be more fun than toiling away here for four years .
fundamentals are the building blocks of fun ...
i always say .
oh , god .
man , she' s gonna kill me .
i' m really sorry .
okay .
sorry .
please call me and i will call you , and thank you .
have a great day .
bye .
she always does this to me .
she' s not coming .
if you' d quit wiggling your ass , it wouldn' t have fallen off in the first place .
coming through .
excuse me .
to conclude our program , we present a special performance ...
are you okay ?
by laraine schleine .
and to accompany miss schleine , we are pleased to present a very special guest .
how' s it going ?
there' s someone here today who lent us a bit of her magic , and now we' d like to give some of it back .
this was tommy gunn' s favorite guitar , and i' m going to sing you the song he wrote for his favorite person in the world .
this one goes out to molly gunn .
every story has an end , but in life , every ending is just a new beginning .
nothing' s wrong when molly smiles
