yeah , likewise .
hey jim , can you cash this check for me ?

hey , what' s this ?
you' re not gonna believe this , but that' s an income tax refund .
i found it in the mailbox of the old place .
you mean , you worked last year ?
six month in a toy factory .
you don' t know how men suffer for children .

when you ran off like this , i feel you' re trying to get away from me .

thank you , bartender .
ok , oldtimer .

oh , god , i will get a job .
yeah , hey .
to the working class .

to us .
to us .
with gods help .
no chance .
even the devil wouldn' t have you .
hey , what' s your problem ?
hey , you got any of those little mints for breath ?
oh yeah .
baby .
excuse me , who are you ?
hmm , the eternal question .
i don' t know .
how do you explain this recent unemployment record ?
hey , anybody didn' t get a job .
takes some man to make you a hard worker .
excuse me ?
hey , i was just joking .
everything here seems to read ' none ' .
hobbies none , religion none , education none .
even where they' d ask you sex you put none .
hardly none .
yeah , you can put down now .
so , how did the job go ?
oh , they gave me a hard on .
they couldn' t use a hard on .
this is a world where everybody' s gotta do something .
you know somebody laid down this rule , that everybody' s gotta do something .
they' ve gotta be something
you know , a dentist , a < ? glider ? > pilot , an arc , a janitor , a preacher , all that .
sometimes , i just get tired of thinking of all the things that i don' t wanna do .
all things that i don' t wanna be .
all places that i don' t wanna go , like india , like get my teeth cleaned .
save the whale , all that .
i don' t understand that .
you' re not supposed to think about it .
i think the whole trick is not to think about it .
oh , i guess wanda went home , huh ?
henry .
yeah ?
eddie came in with a fifth of burbon .
tonight' s his night of , ben' s working his shift .
i won' t miss eddie tonight .
henry , wanda left with eddie .

yeah , i start tomorrow . < ?
matred d musso at frank' s . ? >
listen , i told you not to leave me alone .
don' t hit me !
hit you ?
i' m not your goddamned pimp .
stop acting like one .
why it had to be eddie ? ! ? !
he symbolizes everything that disgusts me !
what ?
obviousness , unoriginal macho energy .
ladies man .
you' re right .
he' s not much .
i made an error , an unhappy error , but i' il drink .
when i drink , i' m moving in a wrong direction .
you know , every time i get with a woman , something happens .
sometimes it happens sooner , sometimes it happens later .
this time it happened pretty fast . < ? ? > you don' t own me .
hey , that' s right .
nobody owns anybody .
i just thought , that we are something special .
because we' re just green corn .
hey , what are we ?
just people that pass in hallways ?
i guess i expect too much .
hey , i can' t handle this scene , you know .
i ought to be a fucking monk .

oh , shit .
what the fuck' s he doing out ?
i don' t know .
he killed one man , they put him in , and he got out , killed that oher guy and now he' s out again .
he killed one man , they put him in , and he got out , killed that other guy and now he' s out again .
maybe it was selfdefence or maybe it' s our penal system .
anyhow , he' s out on parole .
he must jack off his parole officer , when he comes around .
