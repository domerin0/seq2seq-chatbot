it' s facing the stage !
it' s going to be a disaster .
i can' t just sit there and watch .
five seconds and we still haven' t got a laugh .
i' m not running away .
i just don' t like watching a car crash .
particularly when it' s mine .
it' s going to be a catastrophe .
they' il forget their lines .
we won' t get out of new york alive .
there' s pictures of us in the lobby .
i' il get on a plane .
i should have done when we opened in des moines , before we opened , at the dress rehearsal , as soon as the curtain went up .
as soon as the damned phone rang and dotty came on with the sardines .
hold on !
hold your horses !
oh , lord love a duck !
shut up !
i' m on my way .
it' s no good you going on .
i can' t open sardines and answer the phone .
i' ve only got one pair of feet .
hello ?
yes , but there' s no one here , love ...
no , mr brent' s not here .
he lives here , yes , but not now because he lives in spain .
yes , philip brent , who writes plays , only now he writes them in spain .
she' s in spain , too .
they all are .
am i in spain ?
no , i' m not in spain .
i look after the house for them .
only i go home at one on wednesdays , so that' s where i am .
no , because i' ve got a nice plate of sardines to put my feet up with .
and they' ve got colour here , and it' s the royal ... you know , the horse race .
where' s the paper ?
if it' s about letting the house , you' il have to ring the house agents .
squire , squire , hackham and ...
who' s the other one ?
no , they' re next to the phone in the study .
squire , squire , hackham and ...
hold on !
i' il go and look .
as soon as you take the weight off your feet , down it all comes on your head .
and i take the sardines ...

we' ve changed that , have we , dear ?
no , dear .
that' s what i' ve always been doing ?
i wouldn' t say that , dotty .
how about the words ?
am i getting some of them right ?
some of them have a very familiar ring .
it' s like a slot machine up here .
i know that .
i never know what' s going to come out : three oranges or two lemons and a banana .
anyway , it' s not midnight yet , and we don' t open till tomorrow .
you' re holding the receiver .

squire , squire , hackham and ... hold on ! " and noises off .
squire , squire , hackham ...

hanging up the phone .
put your feet up for two minutes and they come running after you .

dotty !
we' ve got the place to ourselves .
wow !

yes , and go out with the newspaper .
the newspaper .
oh , the newspaper .
hang up the phone , leave the sardines and go out , with the newspaper .
here .
sorry .
don' t worry .
it' s just the tech .
it' s the dress , garry .
when was the tech ?
when' s the dress ?
we open tomorrow .
we' re thinking of it as the tech .
it' s the words .
don' t worry about the words .
and that accent .
it' s like oranges and lemons .
your words are fine .
better than the ... you know ?
isn' t that right ?
sorry ?
i mean , ok , he' s the ...
but , dotty , you' ve been playing this kind of part for , well , i mean ...

sorry ?
garry , you' re off .
sorry , lloyd , but ... you know ?
i know .
thanks , lloyd .
so you' re off ...
lloyd , let me just say one thing .
i' ve known many directors , some geniuses , some bastards , but i' ve never met one who was so totally ... i don' t know .
thank you , garry , i' m very touched .

and brooke ?
yes ?

and on we go .
so , there you are , holding the receiver .
i hold the receiver .
i hang it up .
i leave the sardines .
always the same story ...
and you take the newspaper .
i take the newspaper .
i leave the sardines .
a weight off your mind , a load off your stomach .
and off i go at last .
leaving the receiver .
my housekeeper , yes , but ...
and noises off .
stage !
this is her afternoon off , so we' ve got the place to ourselves .
wow !
i' il just check .
hello ?
anyone at home ?
there' s no one here .
what do you think ?
great !
it' s all yours ?
just a shack in the woods .
converted mill , 1 6th century .
must have cost a bomb .
ideal for business .
someone' s coming at 4 . 00 .
arab .
oil .
i' ve got to get those files to basingstoke by 4 . 00 .
we' il just manage to fit it in ...
do it ...
right .
we won' t chill the champagne .
all these doors !
just a handful .
study , kitchen and housekeeper' s flat .
which one' s the ... you know ?
oh , through here .
fantastic !
now i' ve lost the sardines .
i thought no one was here .
i' m not .
only it' s the royal ...
the race where they wear those hats .
who are you ?
from squire , squire , hackham and dudley .
which one are you , then ?
i' m tramplemain .
i thought you were a burglar .
i just dropped in to go into a few things ...
check some measurements ...
do one or two odd jobs .
oh , and i' ve got a prospective tenant .
what' s wrong with this door ?
her interest is aroused .
that' s not the bedroom .
no , that' s the downstairs bathroom and wc .
the housekeeper , mrs crockett .
clackett , dear .
she' s not here .
it' s the royal .
it' s black and white at home .
don' t worry about us .
we' il just inspect the house .
now i' ve lost the newspaper .
sardines !
sorry about this .
that' s all right .
we don' t want the tv .
sardines !
i forgot the sardines .
lloyd !
these damned sardines !
we can' t go on like this .
can' t go on like what , garry ?
it' s ok for you , but we work with them , don' t we ?
sorry ?
the sardines ?
we' re working our asses off and there are four plates of sardines in act one .
poppy !
you want something instead of sardines ?
you want mashed banana ?
we don' t want mashed banana .
we' re changing the sardines .
we' re not angry at you , poppy .
i' m happy with the sardines if you are , hon .
i' m happy if you are .
garry , what are you saying ?
here we are , busting our guts up here and , christ !
i see .
you got that , poppy ?
well ...
right .
on we go from dotty' s exit .
and poppy ?
don' t let this happen again .
no .
sorry . just getting that straight .
as long as dotty' s happy .
absolutely .
do something for me , dotty .
anything .
take the sardines off with you .
i' m sorry about this .
that' s all right .
we don' t want the tv .
she' s been in the family for generations .
come on .
i' ve got to be in basingstoke by 4 . 00 .
perhaps just some champagne ?
upstairs .
and bring my files .
only ...
what ?
her ?
she has been here for generations .
sardines , sardines ...
it' s not for me to say , but i will say this : take the plunge , you' il enjoy it here .
won' t she ?
yes , well ...
we' il enjoy having you , won' t we ?
terrific !
sardines ...
can' t put your feet up on an empty stomach .
she thinks it' s great .
she' s making us sardines .
she' s terrific .
terrific .
so , which way ?
all right .
before she comes back with the sardines .
up here ?
in here ?
yes , yes , yes .
another bathroom .
you always try to get me in the bathrooms !
i mean in here .
ooh !
black sheets !
that' s the linen closet .
this one , this one !
you' re in a real state .
can' t even get the door open .
it' s mrs clackett' s afternoon off .
hold it !
look at it !
hold it !
and god said , " hold it !
and they held it .
and god saw that it was terrible .
the door won' t open .
this door won' t close .
and god said , " poppy !
you know i' m stupid about doors .
you' re doing perfectly .
as long as i didn' t break it .
and there was poppy .
and god said ,
be fruitful and multiply and fetch tim to fix the doors .
i love tech rehearsals !
she loves tech rehearsals !
isn' t she , just ...
where' s dotty ?
everyone' s always so nice .
belinda' s being all , you know ?
freddy , don' t you like an all night tech ?
only because you can sit on the furniture .
it' s good to see you making jokes .
oh , was that a joke ?
this is such a nice company to work with .
broadway in six months !
cleveland in three !
all right , lloyd ?
i know what god felt like when he sat in the dark , creating the world .
what did he feel like ?
pleased he' d taken his valium .
he had six days .
we' ve only got six hours .
and god said , " where the hell is tim ?
and there was tim .
and god said , " let there be doors that open and close .
do something ?
i was getting the bananas .
doors !
i bet god had a stage manager who understood english , too .
that door won' t close .
and the bedroom won' t , you know ?
he hasn' t been to bed for 48 hours .
don' t worry !
only another 24 hours .
look , he' s come down to earth amongst us .
listen , since we' ve stopped ...
it took two days to do the set , so we shan' t have time for a dress rehearsal .
don' t worry .
think of the first night as the dress .
if we can just get through tonight for doors and sardines .
it' s all about doors and sardines , getting on and off , getting the sardines on and off .
that' s farce .
that' s the theatre .
that' s life .
oh , god , lloyd .
you' re so deep .
so just keep going .
bang !
bang !
bang !
bang , you' re on !
bang , you' ve said it !
bang , you' re off !
where' s selsdon ?
oh , god !
selsdon !
poppy !
i thought he was out front .
is mr mowbray in his dressing room ?
would he , during a tech ?
would who ?
selsdon .
he wouldn' t during a tech .
half a chance , he would .
what ?
be fair .
let' s not jump to conclusions .
get the understudy .
tim !
yes ?
hurry up with the doors .
you' re going on for selsdon .
he should never have been let out of our sight .
i said that .
he' s been good in rehearsals .
in the rehearsal hall , it was all ... you know ?
you could see everyone .
here , there' s a front and a back and we' ve lost him .
he' s not in his dressing room .
bathroom ?
prop room ?
paint shop ?
call the police !
doors finished ?
get the gear on !
i' m sorry , dotty , my precious .
no , it' s my fault .
i cast him .
i said , " give him one last chance .
we did summer stock together when i was a kid .
it' s my fault , sweetheart .
this tour is her life savings .
we know that , garry .
i' m not out to make my fortune .
i just wanted to put something away .
we know .
a little house .
it' s not much to ask .
don' t blame yourself .
sorry ?
don' t cry .
i' ve got something behind my lens .
it' s not brooke' s fault .
he was right there before we started .
who ?
it' s all right .
we know you can' t see .
you mean selsdon ?
i' m not blind .
i can see selsdon .
selsdon !
he' s here !
standing there like hamlet' s father .
we thought you were ... not there .
where have you been ?
are you all right ?
speak to us .
is it a party ?
is it a party ?
is it ?
how killing !
i thought there was going to be a rehearsal .
i was having a post prandial snooze so as to be ready for the rehearsal .
isn' t he lovely ?
now we can see him .
what are we celebrating ?
what are we celebrating ?
tim , you look strained and anxious .
i can' t find the gear .
i' ve looked in his wardrobe ...
oh .
beer ?
in the wardrobe ?
no , selsdon .
you need a break .
why don' t you sit down and do the payroll ?
i' il do the bananas first .
he' s been up for 48 hours .
and don' t fall down , tim .
we may not be insured .
what' s next ?
i thought we might try a rehearsal .
i won' t , thank you .
you won' t ?
no , i' il watch .
is this the beer in the wardrobe ?
no , he wants to rehearse .
but shouldn' t we rehearse ?
i knew you' d think of something .
from belinda and freddy' s entrance .
what' s happened now ?
the police .
they' ve found an old man in a doorway .
thank you .
they say he' s dirty and smelly .
i thought , " oh , my god ! " because when you get close to selsdon ...
poppy !
no , if you stand anywhere near him , you can' t help noticing this very distinctive ...
i tell you , poppy , once you get it in your nostrils , you never forget it .
sixty years now , and the smell of the theatre still haunts me .
bless him !
poppy , how did you get a job like this that requires tact ?
you' re not somebody' s girlfriend ?
don' t worry .
he did not hear .
not here ?
yes , there .
go to sleep .
you' re not on for 20 pages .
i might go back to sleep .
i' m not on for 20 pages .
on we go .
dotty in the kitchen with sardines .
garry and brooke on the stairs , freddy and belinda waiting outside , time sliding into the past .
aren' t they sweet ?
garry and dotty .
you mean , they' re ... ?
it' s supposed to be a secret .
but she' s old enough to be ... !
didn' t you know ?
i' m just god .
i don' t know anything .
what' s happening ?
you tell me .
what are we waiting for ?
her 1 8th birthday ?
or maybe just the cue .
brooke !
you can' t even get the door open .
you can' t even get the door open .
door closed , garry , love !
you can' t even get the door open .
we' ve got the place entirely to ourselves .
look at it !
i can' t believe it !
a perfect place for an assignation !
home .
our secret hideaway .
the last place anyone will look .
it' s funny creeping in .
if the inland revenue find out , bang goes our claim to be resident abroad , bang goes most of this year' s income .
i wonder if mrs clackett' s aired the beds .
darling !
why not ?
no children , no friends .
we' re on our own .
true .
there is something to be said for being a tax exile .
leave those !
shh !
the inland revenue may hear us .
what i did with that first lot of sardines i shall never know .
mrs clackett !
my heart jumped out of my boots !
so did mine .
i thought you were in spain .
we are .
we' re not here .
the income tax are after you ?
they would be if they knew .
all right , love .
you' re not here .
i haven' t seen you .
off to bed , are you ?
well ...
nowhere like bed when it all gets on top of you .
you' il want your things .
yes .
that bed isn' t aired .
i' il get a hot water bottle .
all your letters are in the study .
you forward them , don' t you ?
not the ones from the income tax .
oh , my god !
where are they ?
in the little pigeon house , dear .
in the pigeon house ?
i could hear voices .
what sort of voices ?
hold it !
what' s the trouble ?
you know how stupid i am about moves .
sorry .
why do i take the things into the study ?
shouldn' t i leave them ?
no .
i thought it might be more logical .
no .
i know it' s late in the day , but ...
no , several minutes before we open .
as long as we' re not too rushed .
why does he carry the bag and groceries into the study ?
they have to be out of the way .
i see that .
and selsdon needs them in the study .
where is selsdon ?
is he there ?
selsdon !
selsdon !
am i on ?
no , no .
i thought i heard my voice .
no .
go back to sleep .
you' re not on for 10 pages .
i see all that .
oh , no .
but why ?
why does anyone do anything ?
why does that other idiot go out with sardines ?
i' m not getting at you .
of course not .
jesus , why do i ?
who knows ?
who knows ?
the wellsprings of human action are deep and cloudy .
maybe something happened when you were a small child that made you frightened to let go of groceries .
it could be genetic .
or ... you know .
it could be .
i understand all that ...
i' m telling you i don' t know .
i don' t think the author knows .
i don' t know why the author came into this industry .
or any of us .
if you could just give me a reason .
all right .
i' il give you a reason .
you carry them into the study because it' s slightly after midnight and we' re not going to be finished before we open tomorrow .
correction .
before we open tonight !
and on we go , from after freddy' s exit , with groceries .
lloyd , sweetheart , his wife left him this morning .
oh .
freddy ?
i think the point is , you had a great fright when she mentions income tax and you felt insecure and exposed and you wanted something familiar to hold on to .
thank you , lloyd .
bless you !
and on we merrily go .
yes , but i could hear voices .
yes , but i could hear voices .
what voices ?
people' s !
no one' s here .
i saw the door handle move .
must you put your tie on to look ?
mrs clockett .
she' s been here for generations .
look , she' s opened our sardines .
you can' t go down like that .
why not ?
mrs crackett .
she' s irreplaceable .
sardines here , sardines there !
it' s like a sunday school outing .
you still poking around ?
yes , still poking .
still around .
in the linen closet ?
no , no !
yes , just checking the sheets , going through the inventory .
mrs blackett ...
clackett .
is there anyone else in the house ?
no one .
i thought i heard voices .
no voices here .
i must have imagined it .
oh , my god !
i beg your pardon !
oh , my god !
why ?
what is it ?
oh , my god !
the study door' s open .
oh , my god !
there' s another car outside .
that' s not mr hackham' s , is it ?
nothing but flapping doors in this house .
final notice , steps will be taken , foreclosure , proceedings in court ...
a gentleman come about the house .
i' m not here .
he' s got a lady quite aroused .
leave it to the agents .
shall i let them go all over ?
anything , but don' t tell anyone we' re here .
i' il just sit down and ...
sardines !
i' ve forgotten the sardines .
if it wasn' t fixed to my shoulders , i' d forget what day it was .
i didn' t get this .
i' m in spain .
if i didn' t get it , i didn' t open it .
did i have a dress like this ?
i shouldn' t buy anything this tarty .
did you give me it ?
never should have touched it !
stick it down !
never saw it !
i' il put it in the attic with your other precious gifts .
all right .
now the study door' s open again .
what' s going on ?
knocking !
upstairs .
oh , my god !
there' s something in the linen closet .
oh , it' s you !
of course it' s me .
you put me in there with the black sheets .
why did you lock the door ?
why did you ?
i didn' t !
someone did .
we can' t stand here ... in your underwear .
ok , i' il take it off .
in here !
this glue isn' t the sort you can never get unstuck , is it ?
hold it !
mrs clackett' s made us sardines .
we have a problem .
which one this time ?
left .
it' s the left one .
left one !
left one !
could be anywhere .
could have bounced .
where did you last see it ?
it was in her eye .
she opens her eyes very ... don' t you ?
i feel i should rush forward .
careful where you put your feet .
everyone look under their feet .
no one move their feet !
put your feet back where they were !
pick up your feet one at a time .
brooke , is this going to happen during a performance ?
she' il keep going .
can she see ?
can she hear without them ?
sorry ?
oh , sorry !
you stepped on his hand !
oh , look at freddy , the poor thing !
what' s the matter ?
nose bleed .
no one touched him .
violence makes his nose bleed .
sorry .
i thought you spoke to me .
hit the manager with this to finish off theatre in des moines .
anyway , i' ve found it .
where ?
in my eye .
nice going .
your left eye ?
yes .
round the side .
i knew it hadn' t gone far .
ok ?
i think so .
clear the stage .
walking wounded carry stretcher cases .
all right , freddy ?
i just have a thing about ...
we understand .
on we bloodily stagger .
freddy , i' il rephrase that .
on we blindly stumble .
brooke , i withdraw that .
anyway ...
where' s selsdon ?
selsdon !
selsdon !
she might have dropped it out here .
good .
keep looking .
only another five pages , selsdon .
anyway , we can' t stand here ... in your underwear .
ok , i' il take it off .
darling , this isn' t the sort of glue that never comes unstuck , is it ?
oh , mrs clackett' s made us sardines .
now what ?
a hot water bottle .
i didn' t put it there .
i didn' t .
someone in the bathroom filling it .
is something creepy going on ?
darling , are you coming to bed ?
what did you say ?
nothing .
the door handle , the hot water bottle ...
i' ve got goose pimples .
get something on .
under the covers .
what did i do with the sardines ?
you hear funny things about old houses .
but this one has been modernised .
nothing creepy could survive ...
what ?
what is it ?
what' s happening ?
the sardines !
they' ve gone !
there is something funny going on .
i' m going to put my head under the ...
i put them there .
bag !
mrs sprockett must have taken them away .
bag !
what ?
what is it ?
bag !
bag !
what do you mean ?
bag !
bag !
what bag ?
no bag !
your bag suddenly here , now gone !
it' s in the bedroom .
don' t go in there !
the box !
they' ve both gone .
my files !
what' s happening ?
wait here !
no !
get dressed !
i' m not going in there .
i' il fetch your dress .
your dress has gone .
don' t panic !
don' t panic !
there' s some rational explanation .
mrs splodgett will tell us .
you wait here .
no , you can' t stand here like that .
wait in the study .
study , study !
roger , there' s something in there .
where are you ?
i know this is going to sound silly , but ...
i' m going to clear out the attic .
i' m glued to a tax demand .
why don' t you put the sardines down ?
i' m stuck to the sardines .
get that bottle marked " poison " .
it eats through anything .
i' ve heard of people being stuck with a problem , but this is ridiculous !
selsdon !
you' re on , selsdon !
we' re there .
the moment' s arrived .
it' s all right .
he' s coming .
the arm should have come through .
ah !
here it comes .
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be ...
hold it , selsdon .
let' s take it again .
hold it , selsdon !
hold it !
lloyd wants you to hold it .
stop , selsdon !
my god !
like the band playing on as the titanic sank .
stop ?
thank you .
selsdon ...
my dad was nearly on the titanic .
he can hear better than i can .
from your entrance .
it was before the war , so ...
thank you .
poppy !
no .
stops me sleeping .
put the glass back .
come on again ?
right , only sooner .
like yesterday .
freddy !
start when freddy opens the door .
what' s the line ?
i' ve heard of getting stuck with a problem .
start moving on , " i' ve heard of getting stuck with a problem .
i want your arm through the window , right ?
may i make one suggestion ?
what ?
would it perhaps be better if i came on earlier ?
only there' s a hiatus between freddy' s exit and my entrance .
no , selsdon , listen .
yeah ?
i' ve got it .
what ?
come on a little earlier .
we' re thinking along the same lines .
am i putting him on or vice versa ?
freddy , from your exit .
i' ve heard of getting stuck with a problem , but this is ridiculous .
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be prosecuted for incitement .
it makes me weep when i think i used to do banks , bullion vaults .
what am i doing now ?
breaking into paper bags .
i know they' re in spain because the old turkey in the kitchen said so .
and i saw her go out in her swimming costume .
get the van loaded .
no rush .
only got all flaming afternoon .
what have they got to offer ?
one microwave oven .
# 50 .
hardly worth lifting it .
cor !
come here !
junk , junk , junk !
well , yes , if you insist .
now , where' s his desk ?
they all say the same thing : it' s hard to adjust to retirement .
the prospective tenant wishes to know of any history of the paranormal .
yes , everything' s nice and paranormal here .
has anything ever dematerialised or flown about ?
no , things move on their own two feet , just like in any house .
i' il tell the prospective tenant .
she' s inspecting the study .
there' s a man !
there' s no one !
he' s searching for something .
i can' t see no one .
this is extraordinary !
where' s my prospective tenant ?
she' s gone !
disappeared !
oh , my god !
now what ?
the sardines !
can you see them ?
yes .
i can see the way they' re going .
i' m not letting them out of my hand .
but where is she ?
i can see i' m going to be opening sardines all night .
he said , " it' s time to hand over the ammonia bottle to a younger man .
where' s she gone ?
i may be 70 , " i said ,
but i' ve still got all my wits about me .
he didn' t have an answer to that .
vicki !

i said , " when have i had to run off in the middle of a job for a piddle ?
oh , my god !

i can' t talk about tax in this !
i knew i shouldn' t have brought the subject up .
help !
where are you ?
put it on !
it' s a start .
i' il find a bottom .
i' il find a top .
something .
someone in there !
it' s him , it' s him !
i' m finding such lovely things .
remember the biscuit tin you gave me on our first anniversary ?
who are you ?
oh , my god !
i' ve taken your dress off you .
where have you been ?
i' ve been going mad !
look at the state i' m in !
i was trying to explain about the inland revenue and my fingers got stuck .
don' t wave it in my face .
i' m trying to find something .
pair of gold taps .
oh , god !

income tax ?
that' s right .

boxes flying about !
there is something funny going on .

i' ve got the dress stuck to my head now .

i' il do the taps on the bath first .
sex criminals everywhere .

you' re in trouble , you see ?
wc ?
i' il fix it .
vicki !
sheikh !
i thought you were coming at 4 . 00 !
and this is your charming wife ?
you want to see over the house now ?
since you' re upstairs ...
him and his floozy !
let' s start downstairs .
who are you ?
i don' t know who she is .
no connection with the house .
this good lady with the sardines ...
this time , i' m eating them . ... is fully occupied .
the toilet facilities ...
mrs clackett , who are these people ?
just arab sheikhs .
i' m sorry .
this is the downstairs bathroom .
upstairs , we have ...
your ballcocks have gone .
we have him .
irish linen sheets off my own bed !
in the study , however ...
give me that sheet !
there she stands in her smalls for all the world to see .
it' s my little girl .
dad !
my little vicki that ran away .
would you believe it ?
what are you doing here ?
what about you ?
i' m taking our files on tax evasion to basingstoke .
where' s my other sheet ?
ah , a house of heavenly peace !
i rent it !
you !
is it ?
i still have my trousers round my ankles .
i have no dresser .
get tim to help you .
tim !
where' s tim ?
come on , tim !
what ?
oh , you' re acting .
i must have dozed off .
never mind .
do something ?
no , we' il struggle through .
tim sleeps while we run around with our trousers round our ankles .
ok , freddy , from your entrance with trousers round ankles .
so , where' s my other sheet ?
some other problem , freddy ?
since we' re stopped ...
why did i ask ?
i' m stupid about plot .
could i ask another dumb question ?
all of my studies in world drama lie at your disposal .
why is the sheikh philip' s double ?
he comes in and we think he' s , you know ...
that' s the joke .
i see that .
the plot depends on it .
but it is a coincidence , isn' t it ?
it is kind of a coincidence , freddy , yes .
until you reflect that there was an earlier draft of the play .
in this , it' s clear that philip' s father , as a young man , travelled in the middle east .
i see .
you see ?
interesting .
yes .
will the audience get it ?
you show them .
that' s what acting' s about .
thank you , lloyd .
so , from your entrance , freddy .
what' s going to be left of this show when i' m back in new york and you' re up there on your own ?
so , where' s my other sheet ?
ah !
a house of heavenly peace !
i rent it !
you !
is it ?
who else ?
you ask to view this house when you' re a trouserless tramp !
you took the clean sheets !
you snatched my nightdress .
you tossed me aside like a broken china doll .
i won' t ask what you were up to with my girl , but i' il tell you one thing .
brooke !
sorry .
your line !
we' re two lines from the end of the act .
i don' t understand .
tell her .
" what' s that , dad ?
but i don' t understand .
i say , " i' il tell you something .
you say , " what' s that , dad ?
i don' t understand why the sheikh looks like philip .
poppy !
bring the book !
is it " i don' t understand why the sheikh looks like philip " ?
can we consult the author' s text ?
what' s that , dad ?
right .
that' s the line .
we know you' ve worked in places where you make it up as you go along , but we don' t want that here , not when there' s a polished line already .
not at 1 a . m . , not two lines from the end of act one .
not when we' re about to get a coffee break .
we merely want to hear the line " what' s that , dad ? " that' s all .
nothing else !
i' m not being unreasonable , am i ?
exit ?
does it say " exit " ?
oh , my god .
she' s going to wash away her lenses .
oh , dear .
a little heavy .
i thought it was going to be poppy .
this is all my fault .
why brooke ?
it was sweet .
sweet ?
a lovers ' quarrel .
you mean lloyd and brooke ?
where do you think they' ve been all weekend ?
that' s why he didn' t realise the set was wrong .
shh !
here they come .
all forgotten .
i was irresistible .
i' m going to throw up .
what ?
oh , no !
oh , god !
poppy ?
you pig !
you mean ... ?
i didn' t know that .
i' m going to faint .
head between your knees .
nothing she didn' t know !
two weeks ' rehearsal .
that' s all !
what' s next ?
most exciting .
is she all right ?
she will be .
something she ate .
this one' s a bit , you know ?
i' m feeling a bit , you know , myself .
i need that coffee break .
you' re certainly overdoing it .
can we just have the last line of the act ?
me ?
last line ?
right .
well , i' il tell you one thing , vicki .
what' s that , dad ?
when all around is uncertainty , there' s nothing like a good old fashioned plate of sardines .
and curtain !
oh .
all right .
let' s reset for night , act two .
in fact , they loved it in des moines .
at the end of act two , they laughed .
what' s this ?
there' s only one thing missing : a plate of sardines .
yeah .
they clapped and clapped .
in des moines .
well , they clapped .
even selsdon heard them .
but then there was decatur , illinois , then there was cairo , missouri , and paducah , kentucky .
i wasn' t there for the difficulties in decatur or the problems in paducah , but i couldn' t always hold their hands .
how could i be in decatur and paducah when i was doing hamlet in new york ?
i caught up with the show in miami beach .
i was right in there with them when they did that famous matine .
sir , your ticket ?
i' m the director .
don' t tell anyone .
act one places .
your calls , miss otley , miss ashton ,
mr lejeune , mr dallas , miss blair .
act one places , please .
do you think we' il get act one places ?
she' il pull herself together now we' ve called places .
won' t she ?
will she ?
you know dotty .
we' re only at miami beach .
what will it be like by cleveland ?
if only she' d speak .
or unlock the door .
if she won' t go on ...
won' t .
if she won' t ...
of course she will , but if she doesn' t ...
she must !
she will .
but if she didn' t ...
i' d have five minutes to change .
four .
if only she' d say something .
i' il try again .
helps take your mind off your own problems .
has she gone ?
lloyd !
i didn' t know you were coming to miami beach .
i wasn' t .
good you' re here !
dotty and garry ...
no one must know i' m in .
hide this somewhere .
right ...
they' ve had a fight .
there' s a flower stall round the back .
buy some expensive looking flowers .
right .
dotty' s locked herself in .
don' t let poppy see .
she won' t speak to anyone .
the matine finishes by five .
i want two hours alone with brooke in her dressing room , then i' m back to new york .
there may not be a show .
she' s walked out already ?
she' s locked in and won' t speak .
you' ve called places ?
yes .
i can' t do it in five minutes .
she' s broken up with garry before .
brooke ?
not brooke , dotty .
there was the one the week before last in pittsburgh .
she went out with a reporter , but garry threatened to kill him .
don' t worry .
dotty' s got money in the show .
but last night , garry wakes me at 2 a . m . asking where dotty is .
let me tell you about my life .
hamlet' s ghost complains every evening that polonius is sucking sourballs through his speeches .
claudius is off doing a soap and gertrude is off doing a commercial .
hamlet himself has come down with a psychological problem .
then brooke rings to say she' s got a doctor' s certificate for exhaustion .
i can' t find a new vicki .
i have just one afternoon while hamlet sees his shrink to cure brooke of her exhaustion with some whisky , a few flowers you' ve got the money and a certain fading bedside manner .
i haven' t come to hear others ' problems , but to be taken out of myself and not put back .
but ...
done the front of house calls ?
front of house calls .
don' t let poppy see those flowers !
ladies and gentlemen , take your seats .
the curtain will rise in three minutes .
we' re going to be so late .
no luck ?
i haven' t even started the front of house calls .
money .
is that for me ?
no , no !
whisky .
where did you find that ?
not up here ?
he' s hiding it up here !
i' il put it downstairs where he can' t find it .
no ?
you know dotty .
freddy' s trying .
god !
he' s hiding them here .
no ?
no .
you didn' t try for long .
he' s hiding them here now .
garry came rushing out .
i couldn' t understand him .
i am stupid .
but i think he wanted to kill me .
you poor thing !
i left him alone .
is he all right ?
anything but !
he' s going on ?
going on ?
garry ?
of course garry' s going on !
if you have to go on for garry , poppy can' t go on for dotty .
oh , god !
money !
for us ?
no ...
oh , my god !
dotty' s so up and down .
she was perfectly all right last night .
last night ?
she took me to a pub she knows .
she was with you ?
you were with her ?
she was very sympathetic .
she' s not sinking her teeth in !
no .
she came up for coffee and told me her troubles .
we talked till 3 a . m .
i don' t know what room service thought .
and another thing .
where' s selsdon ?
it turns out freddy ...
selsdon ?
not in his dressing room .
front of house calls !
do them .
i' il get selsdon .
what should i do ?
nothing .
you' ve done enough already .
ladies and gentlemen , take your seats .
the curtain will rise in three minutes .
he wants to kill someone ?
selsdon ?
garry .
we' ve lost selsdon .
oh , my god !
flowers !
they' re just , you know .
tim , that' s sweet of you .
isn' t that sweet ?
charming .
i' il look in the bar .
hold these .
i' il take those .
front of house calls !
hold these .
poppy' s done them .
did she give them two minutes ?
ladies and gentlemen , take your seats .
the curtain will rise in one minute .
i think she said three minutes .
did she ?
i think so .
hold these .
ladies and gentlemen , take your seats .
the curtain will rise in two minutes .
any luck ?
no , but i found this .
hidden behind the fire extinguisher .
i' il take it .
put it somewhere out of sight .
he' s ... not in the bar .
have you checked the green room ?
yes .
i' il check again .
take your seats .
the curtain will rise in two minutes .
tim' s said that .
he has ?
take your seats .
the curtain will rise in one minute .
what the fuck is going on ?
lloyd !
i didn' t know you were here .
i' m in new york .
but i can' t sit out there and listen to that .
we' re having big dramas back here .
and out there .
this is a matine .
senior citizens !
curtain up in three minutes , we all start for the gents .
one minute , we run out again .
i' ve got to talk to you .
just tell me one thing .
is brooke going on ?
brooke ?
you' re going on , aren' t you ?
sorry ?
all right ?
all right ?
she sounds like her usual self .
lloyd !
what' s this ?
i was lying on the floor and ...
on the floor ?
for relaxation .
i saw it behind the radiator .
oh , my god !
i' il hide it .
in brooke' s dressing room .
what' s this ?
oh , yes .
sorry .
tim bought them for me .
you ?
we' ve got to talk .
i' ve heard all i want .
what about dotty ?
no !
selsdon ?
this show is beyond my help .
just do it .
i' il sit out there with a bag of sweets and enjoy it .
one minute was the last call , if you remember .
is she all right ?
it' s her way of relaxing .
i couldn' t concentrate back there with the shouting .
it' s her breathing .
you don' t have to go on .
it' s only a matine .
i' m sure poppy would love to do it .
i' il see what' s up with dotty .
freddy , my darling !
what ?
where' s tim ?
where have you been ?
we looked for you everywhere .
everywhere .
there' s no sign of him .
he' s been looking for you .
great shindig going on back there .
i thought tim should know .
he' s heard .
everything !
he really went for her !
i' ve seen the way you' re looking at freddy , " he says .
oh , god !
me ?
yes , darling .
are you sure ?
maybe teddy .
teddy or freddy .
anyway ...

i knew they wouldn' t .
and you' re here ?
yes .

she took it amiss .
ladies and gentlemen , take your seats ...

oh .
lloyd will choke on his sweets !
garry , darling !
trying to give a fellow a leg up , or a leg over ...

very sensible .
you' ve got your claws into freddy , " he said .
dotty !
is she all right ?
she' s fine .
all right , everyone ?
teddy or freddy .
hush , dear !
places , please .
garry , dotty , i won' t make a big speech , but we' ve got to go and perform .
and , well ...
we can' t do it in silence .
we have to speak to each other .
what' s the house like ?
that' s the spirit !
well done !
good for a matine .
there' s a crowd at the back of the orchestra .

some of those seniors haven' t got long .
quiet , then , please .
pre set , please .
quiet on stage , stand by , curtain up , act one .
now what ?
we' re going up .
we' ve been sitting out there an hour .

any other thoughts to communicate ?
not right now .
later .
you bought these flowers for poppy ?
no , well , yes .

study , study !
oh !
there' s something in there ...
i' ve heard of getting stuck with a problem , but this is ridiculous .
i' ve heard of getting stuck with a problem ... ... but this is ridiculous !

lloyd .

i' m not going to be put off !
i know you' il be seeing her .
she' s being difficult , isn' t she ?
then you' il be on the next train to new york .
i bet there' s somebody else in hamlet , but you can' t just walk away .
i' m sorry , but you' ve got to hear because i' m pregnant .
and curtain !
if you thought miami beach was as bad as it could get , you were mistaken .
things got a lot worse backstage by the time we got to spartanburg .
after spartanburg was lynchburg .
after lynchburg , parkersburg and petersburg .
after parkersburg and petersburg , there was peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers burg .
but nothing could have prepared us for the final horror .
cleveland .
i' m something you' il never be , and that' s a star !
your cockney accent sounds like dolly parton .

he never did anything to you !
garry was using you !

oh , speak of the devil .
they' il all go putting their foot in it now , won' t they ?
well ...
i' il just put that down .
that' il keep them out of harm' s way .

converted mill , sixteenth century .
well , one has to have somewhere to entertain business associates .
someone on the phone now , by the look of it .
probably this arab , saying he' s coming at four .
i' il have a word with him .
i' ve got to get those files to basingstoke by four .
we' il just manage to pick it in , to fit it up , i mean ...

but we must talk about the inland revenue .
if they find out we' re in the country , bang goes our claim to be resident abroad .

downstairs !
not upstairs !
the inland revenue may hear !
one moment they' re kicking you , the next they expect more sardines .

i saw the door handle move , and these bags , i mean ...
i' m not sure they were , you know , when we went in .

if someone left them outside ,
i mean , they obviously wish them to be downstairs in the ...
mrs clockett ?

who knows ?
you can' t go like that .
mrs crackett .
she' s irreplaceable .
well , at least i thanked her properly for the sardines .

yes , still poking .
still pulling .
lucky i can' t see far with this leg .
just trying all the doors , checking all the door handles .
mrs blackett .
clackett .

no one .
i heard boxes ...
i found these voices .

i shouldn' t buy anything this brassy .
or did you give it to me ?
i should never have touched it .

this is most exciting .
it' s my fault .
i say , " i' ve heard of getting stuck with a problem , " and open this door ...
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be prosecuted for incitement .
oh , dear .

when i remember i used to do bullion vaults .
what am i doing now ?

i' ve heard of getting stuck with a problem , but this is ridiculous .
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be prosecuted for incitement .

they always come in threes .
when i think i used to do banks .
when i remember i used to do bullion vaults .
hold on !
we know this man !
he' s not a burglar , he' s our social worker !
he' s that nice man who comes and tells us what to do .

i rent it .
oh , it' s the other one !
in her wedding dress .
yes , yes !
it' s their wedding day .
what a happy ending .
to the first act .
of their new life together .
they just want to be alone , if only someone would pull the shades .
come in ?
it' s the bride' s mother .
go out ?
pull the shades !
last line !
i' il tell you one thing , vicki .
what' s that , dad ?
when all around is uncertainty , there' s nothing like a good , old fashioned plate of ... curtain !
what' s this ?
only one thing we' re missing now : a plate of ...
sardines !
bravo !
yes !
i did it !
we did it !
my wonderful cast !
i knew we' d make it .
never doubted it for a moment .
let me tell you , you are a wonderful stage door keeper .
look at these two .
don' t they make a wonderful couple ?
tim' s wonderful , she' s wonderful , whoever she is .
poppy' s wonderful , the baby' s going to be wonderful .
we' re all wonderful .
i' m wonderful .
that' s all it takes for success . : wonderful actors , teamwork , dedication , six months on the road , professionalism .
plus something else i think some kind of miracle .
don' t forget the miracle .
and by the way , another funny thing happened on the road .
i didn' t tell you about this one .
you don' t believe this ?
neither do i.
never seen anything like it .
but what did shakespeare say ?
there' s no business like show business
like no business i know
