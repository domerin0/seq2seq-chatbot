i' m very close to shooting you .
as far as undercover goes , i want to be involved .
you want to work undercover ?
when todd asks where i am , tell him i' m pursuing my credit card bust .
now you' re undercover .
la times got a letter like that a few hours ago .
he knows that , billy .
ls this guy serious ?
he' s serious about the way he pulled the job .
he knew exactly how long to stay inside and what to take .
captain , i have this friend ...
why are you involved in this case ?
i assigned you and taggart to the peterson extortion case .
bogomil , get your men in here .
come on .
you can' t keep god waiting .
i don' t want to hear that kind of talk .
he' s fired every cop who worked for the old chief .
there' s only us three left .
he' s still head of this department .
yes , sir .
very smart , billy .
i have a relationship with this dude .
dude ?
dude ?
we' re not even supposed to be working on this case .
come on , sarge .
i know you have domestic troubles , but you got to cool out , relax .
things like this work out .
trust me .
you moron .
you called the supervising agent of the goddamn fbl to help break this alphabet code ?
this is a local crime .
my men will solve it locally , roseweed .
sir , my name' s not roseweed ...
shut up , please .
and you , captain bogomil , this alphabet investigation was your baby .
did you call the fbl ?
did you order rosewood to do that ?
did you ?
the captain didn' t know about it .
i said shut up !
captain bogomil didn' t call the fbl .
i did .
i said shut up .
i' m waiting on you , andrew .
did you order him to call the goddamn fbl or what ?
no , sir , but that' s beside the point .
no , that is exactly the point .
thank you .
you' re history , kiddo .
you know very well that half of police work are cops following their hunches .
they go with their gut reaction .
i' ve encouraged this in my men and i' m standing behind rosewood .
good !
tell me something , andrew , how do you consider yourself a commanding officer ?
you can' t maintain a supervisory relationship with your own personnel .
and now you superseded the chain of command .
as of now , you are suspended .
what ?
shut up !
on what grounds ?
you have no control over your troop' s activities .
you can' t do this !
i can' t do it ?
i will not have this investigation pissed away .
this crime , this robbery , could be a political disaster for the mayor .
what about due process ?
policy requires we give you a board of review within two days .
you got two days .
i am fighting you on this , harold .
chief lutz to you .
where are you going ?
i' m not through with you two guys .
would you two like to hold onto your jobs a little while longer ?

these shell casings are from the first robbery at adriano' s .
these are . 44 auto mags .
they don' t make these any more too expensive .
this is a casing from a . 308 rifle .
they cut it down to fit a . 44 .

i just realised , you could do me a favour and drop this off at mr fielding' s office .
let me explain something .
my friend bootsie got killed doing this .
i ain' t carrying this cos you made a mistake .
i carry from a to b.
i have a wife and two kids .
i' d like to see my daughters again .
it' s on your way out .
it' s no problem .
lf you just drop it off at mr fielding' s .
what about my daughters ?
what' s in it for my family ?
what do you want ?
what' s in it for me ?
i have beautiful daughters .
you' re asking me to risk my life .

i' m sorry , that' s it .
where' s his office ?
along the corridor , down the steps .
on your way out .
the name' s on the office .
just over there .
i' m just doing this for my kids .
this is how bootsie got killed .
all they found was $20 and a pair of adidas .
along the corridor .
down the stairs .
we almost got fucked up .
thank you .

that' s four shoes .
she knew you were hard to live with when she married you .

i' m karla fry , assistant manager .
how are you ?
beautiful place you have here .
my name' s richard james .
very nice to meet you .
russ , could i see you for a minute ?
be right back .
take your time , russ .
goddamn , that' s a big bitch .
who is that man ?
i don' t know .
he' s got a . 44 auto mag casing from here .
i saw .
you sure it' s ours ?
i made a whole bunch for mr cain .
did you tell him that ?
no .
don' t .
keep him there while i check him out .
i think we have a problem .
fielding made that casing for cain .
you wanted to see me ?
i' d like to go over plan c and d.
we' ve promised to deliver thomopolis $10 million , friday at 6pm .
lf we fail , i' il be put to some inconvenience , to say the least .
so i' d like to go over it and avoid the mistakes made on the adriano job .
what mistakes ?
adriano' s was perfect .
adriano' s was not perfect .
it was perfectly planned , but it was executed with incompetence .
it was partly my fault .
i assumed if my instructions were clear , even you could follow them .
obviously , i was wrong .
i don' t understand .
you supplied your thugs with guns from my club ?
yes .
but they were totally clean .
nobody could trace them .
nobody knows you planned the jobs .
nobody knows you wrote the notes ,
karla did the job and left the notes .
then why is there a man in my club with shell casings from one of my guns asking questions ?
i don' t know .
who is he ?
i' d say he' s a cop .
wouldn' t you ?
i don' t know .
i haven' t seen him .
here he is , on television .
take a good look at him cos you' re going to kill him .
what ?
kill him , burn him , blow him away .
how long would it take to shave those legs ?
i suppose you' re trying to be charming .
just offering my grooming services .
i don' t think so .
chip , perfect timing for once .
chip cain .
i' m the manager here .
how are you , chip ?
beautiful place here , very comfortable .
we do our best .
maybe you' d like to have a guest membership .
that' d be nice , kinda like shooting guns in the house .
where can i send you an application ?
1603 hillcrest .
a big white house .
beautiful place .
we' il send it along with the . 44 shells .
i' il be sure to duck .
goodbye , mr james .
i guess that' s my cue .
excuse me .
you got a match ?
damn .
richard james .
1603 hillcrest road .
right .
hey , cain ... you got a match ?
here you go .
keep it .
and , jack , don' t screw this up .
what about the cop in hospital ?
he' s guarded 24 hours a day .
here' s the impending alphabet note .
will they break this one ?
they' il crack it when we want them to .
how' d it go ?
what would you guys say if i said a six foot blonde works here ?
witnesses reported a six foot blonde at adriano' s .
this isn' t detroit .
six foot blonde women grow on trees in california .
he' s right .
they' re everywhere .
you really need me !
you can' t tell there' s something weird here ?
meet me at my house at 1603 hillcrest in about an hour .
where are my vitamins ?

on a cop' s pay ?
no way .
and there' s an ad for a club called 385 north .
ls that one of your father' s hangouts ?
your father got shot cos he was on to something .
but what ?
do me a favour , use your connections at your company to find out about a guy named maxwell dent .
i' il try .
you can let yourself out .
i' m gonna take a shower .
don' t shoot nobody .
this has got to be a mistake .
there' s his car .
lf he' s here , he must be robbing the place .
i don' t like this , billy .
what would he be doing here ?
maybe the pointer sisters live here .
what ? !
out back .
welcome to wheel of fortune .
i thought i just heard jack say ...
watch out .
the deck' s very slippery .
there' s beer in the refrigerator or you can make yourself martinis .
wait .
you' re on duty .
no martinis .
perrier water is what you want .
swimming trunks in the bedroom .

excuse me .
who are you ?
and who are those people ?
i' m his representative .
that' s former president gerald ford there .
it doesn' t look like gerald ford .
have you seen him without make up ?
probably not .
this is what he looks like now , the ex president .
he couldn' t get out when he was running the country .
now he' s a civilian , it' s his right to shake his ass .
he says , " i wanna go 385 north , " and i said , " let' s go .
we came to party .
you should be proud to have him here .
it' s our pleasure .
thank you very much .
excuse me .
can i have a coke with no ice ?
one coke , no ice , coming up .
there you go .
who' s the popular blond ?
that' s nik thomopolis .
he owns this place .
that' s seven bucks , buddy .
for a coke ?
i can get blown for $7 .
things are getting pretty crazy .
we' re in deep with axel again .
we' il be directing traffic the rest of our lives anyway .
