life' s not fair , is it ?
you see i well ,
i ... shall never be king .
and you ... shall never see the light of another day ....
adieu ...
didn' t your mother ever tell you not to play with your food ?
what do you want ?
i' m here to announce that king mufasa is on his way .
so you' d better have a good excuse for missing the ceremony this morning .
oh now look , zazu .
you' ve made me lose my lunch .
hah !
you' il lose more than that when the king gets through with you .
he' s as mad as a hippo with a hernia .
ohhh ...
i quiver with fear .
now scar , don' t look at me that way ...
help !!!
scar !
mm hmm ... ?
drop him .
impeccable timing , your majesty .
eyyccch .
why !
if it isn' t my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners .
sarabi and i didn' t see you at the presentation of simba .
that was today ?
oh , i feel simply awful . ... must have slipped my mind .
yes , well , as slippery as your mind is , as the king' s brother , you should have been first in line !
well , i was first in line , ... until the little hairball was born .
that " hairball " is my son and your future king .
ohh , i shall practice my curtsy .
don' t turn your back on me , scar .
on , no , mufasa .
perhaps you shouldn' t turn your back on me .
is that a challenge ?
temper , temper .
i wouldn' t dream of challenging you .
pity !
why not ?
well , as far as brains go , i got the lion' s share .
but , when it comes to brute strength ...
i' m afraid i' m at the shallow end of the gene pool .
there' s one in every family sire ...
two in mine actually .
and they always manage to ruin special occasions .
what am i going to do with him ?
he' d make a very handsome throw rug .
zazu !
and just think !
whenever he gets dirty , you could take him out and beat him .
hmmm ...
ah heh heh heh heh heh ... ... simba
hmmm ...
ah heh heh heh heh heh .
dad !
daad !
come on , dad , we gotta go , wake up !
oomph !
sorry !
dad ?
daad .
dad , ...
your son ... is awake ...
dad , dad , dad , dad , dad , dad , dad ...
before sunrise , he' s your son .
dad ?
daad !
come on , dad !
daa whoa !
you promised !
okay , okay .
i' m up .
i' m up .
yeah !
look simba .
everything the light touches is our kingdom .
wow .
a king' s time as ruler rises and falls like the sun .
one day simba , the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king .
and this' il all be mine ?
everything .
everything the light touches ...
what about that shadowy place ?
that' s beyond our borders , you must never go there , simba .
but i thought a king can do whatever he wants .
oh , there' s more to being king than getting your way all the time .
there' s more ?
simba .
everything you see exists together , in a delicate balance .
as king , you need to understand that balance , and respect all the creatures from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope .
but , dad , don' t we eat the animal ?
yes , simba , but let me explain .
when we die, our bodies become the grass .
and the antelope eat the grass .
and so , we are all connected in the great circle of life .
good morning , sire !
good morning , zazu .
checking in ... with the morning report .
fire away .
well !
the buzz from the bees is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot ...
oh , really ? ... and the baboons are going ape over this .
what are you doing , son ?
of course , the giraffes are acting like they' re above it all ...
pouncing .
let an old pro show you how it' s done . ... the tick birds are pecking on the elephants .
i told the elephants to forget it , but they can' t ...
zazu , would you turn around ?
yes , sire .
the cheetahs are hard up , but as i always say ...
stay low to the ground .
cheetahs never prosper ...
okay , stay low to the ground , right yeah ...
what' s going on ?
a pouncing lesson .
oh very good .
pouncing .
pouncing ! ? !
oh no , sire , you can' t be serious ...
oh , ... this is so humiliating .
try not to make a sound .
what are you telling him mufasa ?
mufasa ? ... simba ?
ha ha ha ha ha .
that' s very good .
ha ha ha ...
zazu .
yes ?
sir .
news from the underground .
now , this time
sire !
hyenas !!
in the pride lands !
zazu , take simba home .
oh dad , can' t i come ?
no , son .
i never get to go anywhere .
oh young master , one day you will be king ; then you can chase those slobbering , mangy , stupid poachers from dawn until dusk .
hey uncle scar , guess what !
i despise guessing games .
i' m going to be king of pride rock .
oh goodee .
my dad just showed me the whole kingdom , and i' m going to rule it all .
heh heh .
yes .
well ... forgive me for not leaping for joy ...
bad back , you know .
hey , uncle scar ?
when i' m king , what will that make you ?
a monkey' s uncle .
heh heh .
you' re so weird .
you have no idea ....
so , your father showed you the whole kingdom , did he ?
everything .
he didn' t show you what' s beyond that rise at the northern border ... ?
well , no ... he said i can' t go there .
and he' s absolutely right !
it' s far too dangerous .
only the bravest lions go there .
well , i' m brave !
what' s out th
no , i' m sorry simba ; i just can' t tell you .
why not ?
simba , simba ; i' m only looking out for the well being of my favorite nephew .
yeah , right ; i' m your only nephew .
all the more reason for me to be protective ...
an elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince ...
oops !
an elephant what ?
whoa !
oh dear , i' ve said too much ...
well , i suppose you' d have found out sooner or later , you being so clever and all ...
oh , just do me one favor promise me you' il never visit that dreadful place .
no problem .
there' s a good lad .
you run along now and have fun .
and remember ... it' s our little secret .
hey , nala .
hi , simba .
come on .
i just heard about this great place .
simba !
i' m kind of in the middle of a bath .
and it' s time for yours .
mom ! ...
mom .
you' re messing up my mane .
okay , okay ; i' m clean .
can we go now ?
so where are we going ?
it better not be anyplace dumb .
no .
it' s really cool .
so where is this " really cool " place ?
oh ... uh ... around the water hole .
the water hole ? !
what' s so great about the water hole ?
i' il show you when we get there .
oh ...
uh ...
mom , can i go with simba ?
hmm ...
what do you think , sarabi ?
well ...
pleeeease ?
it' s all right with me ...
all right ! ... as long as zazu goes with you .
no !
not zazu .
step lively .
the sooner we get to the water hole , the sooner we can leave .
so where' re we really going ?
an elephant graveyard .
wow !
shhh !
zazu .
right .
so how are we gonna ditch the dodo ?
oh i know how we can
oh , just look at you two .
little seeds of romance blossoming in the savannah .
your parents will be thrilled ... what with your being betrothed and all .
be what ?
betrothed .
intended .
affianced .
meaning ... ?
one day you two are going to be married !
yuck !
ewww !
i can' t marry her .
she' s my friend .
yeah .
it' d be too weird .
well , sorry to bust your bubble , but you two turtle doves have no choice .
it' s a tradition ... ... going back generations .
well when i' m king , that' il be the first thing to go .
not so long as i' m around .
well in that case , you' re fired .
hmmm ...
nice try , but only the king can do that .
well , he' s the future king .
yeah .
so you have to do what i tell you .
not yet i don' t .
and with an attitude like that ,
i' m afraid you' re shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king indeed .
hmph .
not the way i see it .
i' m gonna be a mighty king .
so enemies beware !
well , i' ve never seen a king of beasts ...
with quite so little hair
i' m gonna be the mane event
like no king was before
i' m brushing up on looking down
i' m working on my roar !!
thus far , a rather uninspiring thing
oh , i just can' t wait to be king !
you' ve rather a long way to go , young master , if you think ...
no one saying do this
no one saying be there
no one saying stop that
no one saying see here
free to run around all day
free to do it all my way !
i think it' s time that you and i.
arranged a heart to heart
if this is where the monarchy is headed
count me out !
out of service , out of africa i wouldn' t hang about ... aaagh !
this child is getting wildly out of wing
oh i just can' t wait to be king !
everybody look left
everybody look right
everywhere you look i' m
standing in the spotlight
let every creature go for broke and sing
let' s hear it in the herd and on the wing
it' s gonna be king simba' s finest fling
oh i just can' t wait to be king !
oh i just can' t wait to be king !
oh i just can' t waaaaaait ... to be kiiiiiiiiiing !
i beg your pardon , madam , but ...

there' s only one way to know .

the only checking out you will do will be to check out of here .
aw , man .
we' re way beyond the boundary of the pride lands .
huh .
look , banana beak is scared .
heh .

and right now we are all in very real danger .

but you' re not scared of anything .
i was today .

yes ...
i thought i might lose you .

dad ?
hmm ?

and we' il always be together , right ?
simba , ...
let me tell you something that my father told me ...
look at the stars .
the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars .
really ?
yes ...
so whenever you feel alone , just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you ... and so will i.
man that lousy mufasa !
i won' t be able to sit for a week .
it' s not funny , ed .
hey , shut up !
will you knock it off !
well , he started it .
look at you guys .
no wonder we' re dangling at the bottom of the food chain .
man , i hate dangling .
shyeah ?
you know , if it weren' t for those lions , we' d be runnin ' the joint .
yeah .
man , i hate lions .
so pushy .
and hairy .
and stinky .
and man are they ...
uuug lee !
oh , surely we lions are not all that bad .
ohh .
oh scar , it' s just you .
we were afraid it was somebody important .
yeah , you know , like mufasa .
yeah .
i see .
now that' s power .
tell me about it .
i just hear that name and i shudder .
mufasa .
ooooh ....
do it again .
mufasa .
ooooh .
mufasa .
mufasa !
mufasa !
oooh !
it tingles me .
i' m surrounded by idiots .
not you scar , i mean , you' re one of us .
i mean , you' re our pal .
charmed .
ohh , i like that .
he' s not king , but he' s still so proper .
yeah .
hey , hey hey .
did ya bring us anything to eat ,
scar , old buddy , old pal ?
huh ?
did ya did ya did ya ?
i don' t think you really deserve this .
i practically gift wrapped those cubs for you .
and you couldn' t even dispose of them .
well , ya know ... it wasn' t exactly like they was alone , scar .
yeah .
what are we supposed to do ?
kill mufasa ?
precisely .
i know that your powers of retention
are as wet as a warthog' s backside
but thick as you are , pay attention
my words are a matter of pride
it' s clear from your vacant expressions
the lights are not all on upstairs
but we' re talking kings and successions
even you can' t be caught unawares
so prepare for the chance of a lifetime
be prepared for sensational news
a shining new era
is tiptoeing nearer
and where do we feature ?
just listen to teacher
i know it sounds sordid
but you' il be rewarded
when at last i am given my dues !
and injustice deliciously squared
be prepared !
yeah , be prepared .
yeah heh .
we' il be prepared , heh ...
for what ?
for the death of the king .
why ?
is he sick ?
no fool , we' re going to kill him .
and simba too .
great idea !
who needs a king ?
no king !
no king !
la la la la laa laa !
idlots !
there will be a king !
hey , but you said , uh ...
i wlll be klng !
stick with me , and you' il never go hungry again !
yaay !
all right !
long live the king !
long live the king !
long live the king !
it' s great that we' il soon be connected .
with a king who' il be all time adored .
of course , quid pro quo , you' re expected
to take certain duties on board
the future is littered with prizes
and though i' m the main addressee
the point that i must emphasize is
you won' t get a sniff without me !
so prepare for the coup of the century
be prepared for the murkiest scam
meticulous planning tenacity spanning
decades of denial
is simply why i' il be king undisputed
respected , saluted
and seen for the wonder i am
yes , my teeth and ambitions are bared
be prepared !
yes , our teeth and ambitions are bared
be prepared !
now you wait here .
your father has a marvelous surprise for you .
ooooh .
what is it ?
if i told you , it wouldn' t be a surprise , now would it ?
if you tell me , i' il still act surprised .
ho ho ho ...
you are such a naughty boy !
come on , uncle scar .
no no no no no no no .
this is just for you and your daddy .
you know , a sort of father son ... thing ...
well !
i' d better go get him .
i' il go with you .
no !
heh heh heh .
no .
just ... stay on this rock .
you wouldn' t want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas ...
you know about that ?
simba , everybody knows about that .
really ?
oh , yes .
lucky daddy was there to save you , eh ?
oh , and just between us , you might want to work on that little roar of yours , hmm ?
oh , okay ...
hey , uncle scar ?
will i like the surprise ?
simba , it' s to dle for .
shut up .
i can' t help it .
i' m so hungry ...
i gotta have a wildebeest !
stay put .
well can' t i just pick off one of the little sick ones ?
no !
we wait for the signal from scar .
there he is ...
let' s go .
little roar .
puh !
rarrr !
rrrraowr nh .
raowr !!
oh look , sire .
the herd is on the move .
odd ...

hold on !

dad .
we gotta go home .
heeeeelp !
somebody !
anybody ... help .
simba ....
what have you done ?
there were wildebeests and he tried to save me
it was an accident , i didn' t mean for it to happen .
of course , of course , you didn' t .
no one ever means for these things to happen ...
but the king is dead .
and if it weren' t for you , he' d still be alive .
oh !
what will your mother think ?
what am i gonna do ?
run away , simba ...
run ...
run away , and never return .
kill him .
whoa !!
yeooow !
hey there he goes !
there he goes !
so go get ' im .
there ain' t no way i' m going in there .
what you want me to come out looking like you ?
cactus butt ?
but we gotta finish the job .
well , he' s as good as dead out there anyway .
and if he comes back , we' il kill him .
yeah ! you hear that ?
if you ever come back , we' il kill ya !
mufasa' s death was a terrible tragedy , but to lose simba ... who had barely begun to live ...
for me , it is a deep personal loss .
and so it is with a heavy heart that i assume the throne .
yet , out of the ashes of this tragedy , we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era in which lion and hyena come together , in a great and glorious future .
heeyyyaaaahh !!
get out !
get out !
get outta here !!!
whoo !
i love it !
bowling for buzzards !
gets ' em every time .

and they don' t have a clue who ?
they' il fall in love and here' s the bottom line
our trio' s down to two . oh ...
ze sweet caress of twilight
there' s magic everywhere
and with all this romantic atmosphere
disaster' s in the air
can you feel the love tonight ?
the peace the evening brings
the world , for once , in perfect harmony
with all its living things
so many things to tell her
but how to make her see
the truth about my past ?
impossible !
she' d turn away from me
he' s holding back , he' s hiding
but what , i can' t decide
why won' t he be the king i know he is
the king i see inside ?
can you feel the love tonight ?
the peace the evening brings
the world , for once , in perfect harmony
with all its living things
can you feel the love tonight ?
you needn' t look too far
stealing through the night' s uncertainties
love is where they are .
and if he falls in love tonight
it can be assumed
his carefree days with us are hist' ry
in short , our pal is doomed
isn' t this a great place ?
it is beautiful ...
but i don' t understand something .
you' ve been alive all this time .
why didn' t you come back to pride rock ?
well , i just ... needed to get out on my own .
live my own life .
and i did .
and it' s great !
we' ve really needed you at home .
no one needs me .
yes we do !
you' re the king .
nala , we' ve been through this .
i' m not the king .
scar is .
simba , he let the hyenas take over the pride lands .
what ?
everything' s destroyed .
there' s no food , no water .
simba , if you don' t do something soon , everyone will starve .
i can' t go back .
why ?
you wouldn' t understand .
what wouldn' t i understand ?
no , no , no .
it doesn' t matter .
hakuna matata .
what ?
hakuna matata .
it' s something i learned out here .
look , sometimes bad things happen
simba ! ... and there' s nothing you can do about it !
so why worry ?
because it' s your responsibility .
well , what about you ? you left .
i left to find help !
and i found you .
don' t you understand ?
you' re our only hope .
sorry .
what' s happened to you ?
you' re not the simba i remember .

no , just disappointed .
you know , you' re starting to sound like my father .

you don' t even know what i' ve been through .
i would if you' d just tell me !

i can' t go back .

it won' t change anything .
you can' t change the past .
you said you' d always be there for me ! ...

and it' s because of me .
it' s my fault ...
it' s my ... fault .

yeah , but it' s not easy .
i know what i have to do .
but , going back means i' il have to face my past .
i' ve been running from it for so long ...
oww !
jeez what was that for ?
it doesn' t matter ; it' s in the past !
yeah , but it still hurts .
oh yes , the past can hurt .
but the way i see it , you can either run from it ... or ... learn from it .
hah !
