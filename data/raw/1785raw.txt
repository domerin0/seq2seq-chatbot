inever dreamed that the life of my grandsons ... which began with such love and comfort ... would turn to see so much violence and bloodshed .
this is their story , as it was told to me .
we should disappear .
go someplace where we can see everything .
let me see your knife .
can i carve my name in your face ?
you goddamn son of a bitch !
chris !
god !
brandy , get over here .
come here !
he' s getting away .
that son of a bitch broke my goddamn window !
calm down .
you angry about something ?
no .
he said that he ... has just about had it with you .
you want the truth ?
i think you pushed your old man just about as far as you can push him .
i drive down here once a week to bail your ass out of some mess .
i don' t want to hear your excuse .
go on outside and get in the car .
just wait .
what ?
what am i waiting for , buddy ?
you gonna collect yourself , show me some respect ?
what' s it gonna take , chris ?
i' m not going !
i said , get in the goddamn car .
today was supposed to be about your brother .
it' s his birthday .
it' s not about you .
bad enough we' re waiting with our party hats on ... to get a call like that , how do you think that makes tim feel ?
it' s all right , dad .
no , it' s not all right .
don' t you care about anybody but yourself ?
... searching for an escaped inmate after yesterday' s prison break ... at the county penitentiary .
two guards were stripped and killed in the incident following the riot .
in college basketball ....
you can forget about that girlfriend of yours .
duck out on your responsibility again , i' il bury you alive .
you never let me leave this place .
you wanna leave ?
you wanna leave this place ?
we can' t even have friends !
what kind of birthday is it with just the three of us ?
it' s like we' re being locked up , and for what ?
what are you afraid we' re gonna do ?
i' m sorry i ruined your birthday .
i thought my birthday party would be a lot of fun .
you and dad and me , we' d all have a good time .
but it didn' t happen like that .
before you know it ... things you say ... nobody' s gonna listen .
i know what you feel .
you' re just a kid .
enjoy it while it lasts .
now i' d like to introduce a special trio .
the rebecca trio have come , and have a song ... about what wonderful grace the lord jesus christ gives us to live with .
i feel the touch
of hands so kind and tender
they' re leading me
in paths that i must trod
i' il have no fear
when jesus walks beside me
for i' m sheltered in
the arms of god
so let the storms rage high
the dark clouds rise
they don' t worry me
for i' m sheltered safe
within the arms of god
he walks with me
and none other shall harm me
for i' m sheltered in
the arms of god
chris .
i' m going into town .
i won' t be back till late .
where' s tim at ?
i don' t know .
you put salt water in the feed ?
yeah , but i can' t do all this by myself .
why don' t you send tim out here to help for once ?
he' s no good at work .
not much for strength .
i' m gonna have some of his birthday cake .
not until you' re done working here .
there' s a lot to be done .
it won' t work .
it won' t blow .
got a hole in your foot .
i know .
it smells .
can i stick my finger in it ?
in the hole ?
no .
i would just wiggle it around , it would be cool .
you' re up awful late .
dad ?
yeah .
you' re home .
i' m pretty beat .
i know i' ve been hard on you , chris , but you know i love you .
you must have looked pretty classic with that board sticking out of your foot .
wished i' d seen that .
it hurt .
it hurt like crap .
sometimes it' s the strange moments that stick with you .
i' m gonna go to bed .
good night , dad .
tim , wake up .
it' s a gift .
i like it .
you' re trying to ....
don' t spit on me !
i' m tired of looking at your head .
come up here and bring me some nails .
i don' t like being up there .
who' s that ?
i think i' m lost .
does john munn live here ?
he' s somewhere .
who are you , little man ?
he' s here .
dad !
can i help you ?
john ?
put that booger down , brother , and come give me a kiss .
well , i' il be .
deel .
it' s a shocker , ain' t lt ?
i found you .
these yours ?
yeah .
come on in .
that dad' s brother ?
never seen him before .
you like his car ?
shut up .
what are you doing ?
organizing my books by the way they smell .
this one' s about a guy ....
thought a lot about you , i got to say , deel .
yeah , well , i never did get no valentines , john .
i didn' t know if you' d want to hear from me ... the way you blamed me for things .
don' t say you didn' t .
i won' t .
then when audrey died ...
i just couldn' t bear it .
took the kids out of school , didn' t tell nobody .
moved out here to live in the sticks like hermits .
because people ....
sort of no reminders when you tear away from people .
i couldn' t handle it ... the thought of you stuck in that place .
i was gonna go see you .
i even made plans , but i didn' t .
i just
you don' t gotta say nothing , john .
i feel like if i forgive ... then i' il be forgiven .
lice gets everywhere .
stay still .
was she pretty ?
who ?
mom .
she was kind of good looking , i guess , for a mom .
she had a little moustache , though .
i always thought that was weird for a lady .
i remember her kind of perfume .
you wanna smell my armpit ?
no .
i wanna get me a haircut .
what are you gonna do now ?
got any plans ?
i always got plans .
here , wear that .
long as i stay in the state , i' m good .
check in with the parole officer every once in a while .
i got some masonry work lined up
watch your step there .
tim' s got a rough stomach .
got to admit , john ... you look like you' re doing all right for yourself .
we' re doing well enough .
we really are .
i sold all six hogs to this korean farmer last week , just to clear the place out .
i' ve been looking for a good man to keep up around here .
i got some work at this little taxidermy shop .
it' s way out in bilton .
tell you what , why don' t you stick around till your work starts ?
you could ... be a help to me .
how' s that ?
well , those kids are a handful .
tim' s got health problems .
they' re getting serious .
and when i' m gone , i worry chris is gonna get into trouble ... and not take care of his responsibility .
seems like every time i turn around ... the cops got him picked him up for something or other .
breaking windows ....
he popped this kid in the face with a rake .
then he breaks into a church .
the preacher finds him asleep on the altar , drunk on wine .
i could use another pair of eyes around here .
i couldn' t pay you , but you get a roof over your head , and i' il feed you .
that way me and you could spend some time together , like you said .
i' d like that .
it' s all the same to me .
a chicken ain' t nothing but a bird .
remember them old mexican gold coins ...
dad stole from that museum when we was kids ?
he always said when he died , you and me should split up the worth ... and treat ourselves like kings .
when he died , they raided this place .
they took everything .
they even took those old lndian ashtrays .
old man was a hell of a pirate .
but the worst taste in art .
i like them boots .
they' re pretty cool .
you' re cool .
i don' t think he' s got anyplace else to stay .
he' s gonna stay with us for a little while .
we' il see how it goes .
what are you doing ?
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to scare you .
y' all sleep tight .
i' m gonna hit it .
it' s good to be here .
good night .
oh , this here' s the boat i' ve hoped for
oh , land , please pardon me
that' s a song my father used to sing .
i haven' t heard that in years .
what' s wrong ?
i' m just ....
i' m scared of the way you make me feel .
i think i might be too young for my head .
i didn' t touch you .
it' s your dad , right ?
i don' t know what we' re doing .
i care about you , chris , but ...
i can' t .
hot enough for you ?
it ain' t the heat that gets to me .
it' s the stupidity .
goddamn , this is a beautiful land .
i used to take days like this for granted .
we' ve had a lot of rain .
so it' s like ... all this life .
it' s like living in a fishbowl .
that' s what it' s like .
what ?
i said it' s like living in a fishbowl , being stuck here like a workhorse .
must get kind of cramped being a slave .
me , i gotta get away now and then .
what about you ?
god , i love to drive .
has he changed much ?
from when y' all were kids ?
old john ?
no , he' s pretty much the same .
he' s got a few silly new fur coats , kind of queer .
did you know my mom ?
i knew your mom first .
she was my girl .
he didn' t mention that little detail , though , huh ?
no , i shouldn' t think he would .
what did he tell you about me ?
he said you were in prison .
you got a girlfriend ?
not really .
that' s smart , boy .
you gotta live a little first .
girls mess with your head .
make you do crazy things .
did you hurt somebody ?
you wanna drive ?
i' il work the gearshift .
nah .
somebody better take the wheel .
better take the wheel .
no !
come on , champ .
take it .
somebody better take the wheel , kiddo .
shit , yeah !
i forgot what it feels like .
what feels like ?
are you scared ?
here , tim , try some sweet potatoes .
tim don' t eat much .
what , is he afraid he' il get fat or something ?
he' s already got a bunch of cellulite .
look at all that goop .
it' s about affinity .
doctor says his brain ain' t ready for it .
it' s an anxiety disorder .
freaks out his ulcer .
it' s called an anxiety disorder .
take your hat off at the table .
it ain' t thanksgiving .
when i was a boy , i used to worry about pilgrims .
i had this nightmare that a whole bunch of you bastards ... would bust into my room with your shirts off ... and you' d tickle me crazy .
you' d make me walk the plank or eat turkey until i got fat .
you' d force me to just eat and eat .
till all of a sudden i realized i was an animal .
an animal eating an animal .
then i' d wake up with a start ... and find i' d pissed my pajamas .
it is kind of funny now .
it wasn' t so funny then .
how much work did you guys get done today ?
not as much as we hoped .
we had to run into town , get some supplies .
come on , now .
dish up .
y' all say grace ?
occasionally .
feel free .
thank you for this food .
hope everybody has a nice time .
amen .
hallelujah .
i want a leg .
supplies in town , huh ?
well , tell you the truth , chris wanted to take a ride in my car ... and i could' ve said no , but i didn' t want to get off on the wrong foot with him .
you went driving ?
i get home and nothing' s done .
you' re sure right about them two .
they ain' t exactly fond of work .
i kept having to stop what i was doing to go and track them down .
don' t put it all on the boys , deel .
that' s not what we agreed on .
you' re supposed to look after them .
i' m just trying to give the kids some elbow room .
we were not exactly angels when we were their age , john .
that' s right .
you don' t trust me , do you ?
lf you want me to leave , just say so .
no .
for the longest time out here , just me and the boys , i was sure ...
i' d made a wreck of things .
you know what i mean ?
i just wanted us to be a family .
well , anyhow , now you' re here .
maybe i got a second chance .
let' s not mess it up .
okay .
are you gonna eat that ?
what ?
that .
no , go on .
help yourself .
big old piece of gristle .
hurry up .
dad wants you .
hi .
yeah ?
dad ?
remember when we had that painting made ?
had to stand still , without sleeping .
it took a night and a day .
what did i do now ?
fuck .
so i hear you just had a birthday .
how old does that make you ?
ten years old .
ten .
well , you' re a heck of a lot smarter than most 10 year olds i know .
that is a sharp looking jet .
chris made it by hand .
damn nice .
you' re daddy' s got a lot of real nice things , too , don' t he ?
you know , when i was your age ... my daddy , he had a collection of old mexican coins .
he used to let me and john play with them sometimes .
they were solid gold .
dad has some like that .
i knew that .
you know , your granddaddy , he gave them to john and me , his two sons .
your dad , he probably just forgot that half are mine .
where does he keep them at ?
keeps them hid .
well , where does he hide them at ?
it' s a secret .
well , see , i' m family and i' m pretty good at keeping secrets .
it' s a secret from me , too .
you don' t say ?
you shouldn' t do that .
you shouldn' t open a can like that .
you' il bust your knife blade .
what are you doing ?
i found your stack of nudie books in a chest under a rock back here .
you got good taste .
that stuff ain' t mine .
i ain' t gonna say nothing .
i ain' t got no business busting in on dirty secrets .
besides , me and you is friends .
ain' t that right ?
that' s right .
yeah .
i never had all the advantages like john .
i got the leavings and was told to like it .
i see the way your daddy looks at your little brother .
you know there' s something .
he sees himself .
like looking in a goddamn mirror .
then there' s you .
you' re just one of his little pigs .
a hole in the ground .
i like you , chris .
you don' t play games .
don' t ever let the same dog bite you twice .
you know what i mean ?
knock knock .
who' s there ?
lnterrupting cow .
lnterrupting cow who ?
moo !
it doesn' t work .
you' ve got the wrong tool .
did you and uncle deel fight a lot when you were kids ?
we had our problems ... but our dad didn' t put up with too much nonsense .
he was nice too , right ?
he gave you that treasure .
you mean those coins ?
that' s right , he did .
you know those coins ain' t ordinary coins ?
what do you mean ?
it' s a long story .
it' s from pirates ?
no , not exactly .
do you know about charon , the ferryman of the dead ?
according to a legend , when you pass into the realm of the dead ... your spirit has to pay passage to cross the river styx into hades .
you have to pay charon .
he' s the ferryman .
he' s this winged demon .
the price , one gold coin per soul .
if you don' t have a coin ... then you' re condemned to wander the banks of the river for 100 years .
like in hell ?
no .
just waiting .
a long time ago , my father went for a walk to the river .
at the ferry crossing , he sees this old mexican ferryman , all dressed in rags ... pays him a nickel , crosses over , doesn' t think much of it .
when he gets home , he reaches his hand in his pocket ... and pulls out a gold coin that hadn' t been there before .
but my dad couldn' t stop thinking about that poor man .
how much food that coin would buy .
so the next day , he crosses the river again .
he gives the man a gold coin .
the man thanks him and takes him across the river .
but when he got home , he reaches in ... and now he' s got two gold coins .
same thing happened the next day , and the day after : five coins .
then 10 , and 20 and 40 .
on and on .
his pockets grew fat .
then one day , the river dried up ... the ferryman was gone and never came back .
my dad said he thought that was charon .
and that he was paying the living ... what he kept from the dead .
that' s why i saved them all this time .
those coins are cursed .
they' re the debt the dead had to pay .
if they' re worth so much , why don' t you just sell them so we can get rich ?
i pawned one off last year to buy that station wagon .
you see what a pain in the ass that' s been , it went to prove my point .
there are demons .
and they got a sick sense of humor .
go on , now .
get washed up , you sculp .
dad , why was deel in jail ?
before our parents died ... he got some bad news that upset him .
it was something i did .
i let my brother down .
but i' m not proud of it .
he came to find me for a reason .
what are you doing ?
dressing up in your clothes .
pretending i' m you .
your boots are a little too big , though , honestly .
i thought things were good between us .
you lied to me , john .
i knew it .
always twisting things around so you come out on top .
i show up and you got a second chance ?
well , i never had a first chance .
you and the old man saw to that .
first my girl , now my money .
everything that belongs to me is here .
don' t bring audrey into this .
you brought her into it .
when i was pinned down .
when i walk into my own bedroom and see you with my girl .
seen you with her , john !
that' s right .
she' s an old case and you won , john .
but chris is my son and you' ve always known that .
get out of my house .
i can' t let this go , john .
i' m not gonna stand here and listen to this .
that' s because you never listen .
you never listen to me .
as for what i did , we were young .
i' m sorry .
is that what you want me to say ?
i want my money .
put those coins down .
you think that' s gonna make it better ?
those coins are greed , deel .
it' s your own greed you' re trying to disguise .
you' re scared of this world .
you think if you hide everything , it' il be easy .
don' t ever hit me again .
you hear me ?
son of a bitch !
no !
open it .
come here .
what' s happening ?
is it uncle deel ?
let' s move .
what about dad ?
he' s out there ... somewhere .
go .
let' s go out the back .
dad !
hell !
out the window !
come on !
i can' t , chris .
it' s too high .
yes , you can !
it' s in your head .
quick .
climb down the ladder .
come on .
get down .
are you coming ?
just go .
i can' t !
this is how it looks .
nobody knows i' m here .
the law already has an opinion of you .
and it' s your knife ... that killed my brother .
it' s a pity , too .
you and i was friends .
chris !
get in !
i can' t drive stick .
the coins !
give me those .
get out .
move !
his keys .
come on !
are we gonna tell the police ?
he' s got my knife and my fingerprints .
cops will think i did it .
everybody' s looking for a reason to put me away .
you okay ?
did he hurt you ?
no .
we got nobody .
where are we gonna go ?
we' il shave our heads ... grow beards and only speak apache .
i don' t know .
we should go to mexico .
gold' s good there .
we can' t sell them .
it' s bad luck .
i' il take all the luck i can get .
i got an idea .
come on .
excuse us !
if you need any work done , we' il give you a hand for a bite to eat .
nice hat .
boys !
lunch is ready .
okay , y' all .
eat some of this shit .
you want to hear a joke ?
it' s a mexican weather joke .
what' s the weather like in mexico ?
chili today , hot tamale .
aw , come on  you and your jokes !
it' s a damn funny joke .
there' s some damn fine food up in here .
really ?
think so ?
it' s been a long time since somebody treated us so good .
thank you .
it' s been a long time since we had some young people ... sit with us .
we' re unable to have children .
we had us a little one for a while .
a little baby boy .
but he wouldn' t take my milk .
i tried and tried , but my breasts were strangers to him .
what we do now is we count the blessings that we do have .
my baby .
amen .
praise jesus .
little man , eat .
because you don' t eat , you won' t be able to grow up like this .
hello .
you know what wadsworth did ?
what ?
pulled a nickel out of my armpit .
can' t buy much with a nickel .
i like this goat .
you don' t look so good and you didn' t hardly eat .
you don' t like my cooking ?
now , you boys look exhausted .
why don' t you stay here and rest a while ?
my shoulder hurt .
that little one looks so sick .
what about my pain ?
he said keep an eye on them ... that he' d be here soon .
i hope i done the right thing .
be all right .
they probably just lost and hungry , forgot where their home was .
i done that myself .
where they at , anyway ?
they' re in a hammock , resting .
out back ?
i told him they would be there .
howdy .
mr. pela ?
nice place .
it' s a damn nice place you got .
them boys is pretty smooth .
i ain' t surprised they got one over on you , either .
didn' t take me over .
they ran out this morning when they seen the workload i had for them .
really ?
what' s wrong ?
howdy , ma' am .
how' re you doing ?
they' re gone .
they disappeared .
they ran off .
what you mean , they' re gone ?
when' s the last time you seen them ?
i don' t know .
did they tell you where they' re going ?
they said they were going down to watertown ... working on the water .
we should call the sheriff .
get a couple of cars out looking for them .
they couldn' t have got far .
don' t be calling the sheriff , damn it !
tim .
yeah ?
guess what ?
what ?
there' s a cow .
i know .
i want to milk the hell out of it .
get them up !
i miss dad ... and the hogs ... and my books ... and my shower cap .
i know .
when dad died , you think he got across the river ?
we should keep the coins .
dad might need them for the ferryman and come back .
i think you might have chiggers .
they' re too small to see , so it' s just from the bites .
the bites are really big .
you know , chiggers ... they' re , like , the smallest animals on earth to have such a harmful bite .
they hurt a lot and it' s like poison ivy .
i read a book about them ... but it was a long time ago ... and i forget now .
but i do remember that they don' t bite your skin , they just ....
well , they bite your skin , they don' t feed off of it .
they just bite it , and that' s where their nest is ... that little red dot .
and if you smush them , they die .
they' re all red , but in the middle , it' s even redder ...
iike flowers , you know , with the thorns .
but on the outside they' re just pink , like your bumps right there .
if we were like big size chiggers ... if i bit you , there' d be a big lump on your head .
really big .
because the bites are bigger than they are .
so it would hurt a lot .
if we moved to some country like iceland or nebraska ... ... there it' s too cold for them , so we' d be safe .
and they' d all either die or run away .
i couldn' t tell if that was a man or a woman .
there are a lot of red ants over here .
do you like books ?
yup .
the jinx of payrock canyon .
that' s a really good book .
it' s about this guy who' s just going around , and then he finds this treasure .
and he doesn' t know what it is and he has to go find it .
when he opens it up , it puts a curse on him .
and he avenges the guy ... that put the curse on him .
nothing personal , chris .
i' ve got labor laws to deal with around here .
labor laws .
they' il take me off in handcuffs if i hire someone like you .
we have nothing here for you .
i appreciate your stopping by .
shut up !
who was that ?
i don' t know .
what did he want ?
money .
all i have is the nickel wadsworth gave me .
so i gave him my book .
why did you do that ?
i don' t know .
i didn' t get that job .
do they have whores , i mean horses , in mexico ?
hell , yeah .
goddamn it .
shit .
backwards .
turn off the goddamn engine , retard .
hey , man , don' t i know you from someplace ?
i don' t think so .
did you ever hear of a singing and dancing group called " the historics " ?
look man , i' m in a hurry .
it' s kind of like a play on words , like storks , like the bird ... but " historics " because they
like i said , i' m in a hurry , and this car ... keeps conking out on me every time i try to get anywhere .
you think you can persuade it to give me a little more ....
it needs torque .
you know about
there was another wreck the other day .
an ice cream truck wiped out on the road .
we had to tow it .
it still had the ice cream in it .
it was melted , but we ate it anyway .
why are you standing right behind me , retardoe ?
go back in the truck .
you ever do any time ?
look , i' m in a hurry .
where you want me to sit ?
i just got out of charm school myself .
you can sit  can i sit in the back of my car ?
you could , but there' s always a danger of a disconnect ... and the car would roll out .
you wouldn' t be able to drive it because it' s dead .
you' re coming over here now .
i ain' t sitting in the middle .
those boots are awesome .
i think they' re awesome .
we can sit in  i' il sit in the middle .
there' s this one song that the historics do .
there' s a monster in the canyon
don' t you know that there' s a monster in the canyon
think you' il ever get married ?
i don' t know .
they look happy ... but you never can tell .
thank you .
shit .
you seen two kids hanging around here ?
i saw a kid up the street .
tied his babysitter to a tree with a thing of barbed wire .
what did he look like ?
just a kid , i guess .
he had a double chin .
bad sunburn .
what' s wrong ?
i swallowed my gum .
shit .
how did you come by that thing on your face ?
i choked on my gum .
kind of weird .
got that radiator fixed up as quick as we could .
cool .
it should last a good while .
keep her fervid .
all right .
bye .
see you later .
thanks again .
what , are you crying now ?
what does it look like i' m doing ?
throwing up boogers .
i' il give you a booger .
i' il give you a booger right where you
this is going in your big , fat , stupid , baby mouth .
check it out .
the old clerk thought i just went in to take a leak .
where are we going ?
i' il get work .
we' il get set up and then head south till we get to mexico ... go eat cheese or something .
you want some ?
no .
you got the wrong damn end .
hurry up .
come on , man !
if i was looking for work out here , who would i talk to ...
iike working on boats or whatever ?
you can talk to any of these guys on a boat around here .
if he' s got a boat .
i got a crew right now .
if i can get them to work .
they won' t work .
they stand around jawing their mouth , talking about hurricanes and stuff .
let me tell you the truth .
i' m looking for two boys .
my boys , they run out on me .
i figure they might be working out here .
you seen them ?
no .
what they look like ?
a little bit like me , just smaller .
anybody here ?
anybody here ?
i wish we had a knife so we could kill animals that come around .
you never killed nothing in your life .
a mosquito .
it' s not a mosquito .
it' s a firefly .
there was something granddaddy used to say .
something he told me a long time ago .
he was mama' s dad .
he was walking in the woods ... and there were fireflies .
a bunch of them , blinking off and on .
he called them nature' s nightlights .
to help animals find their way in the dark .
can' t keep them .
they need to be able to fly around .
they' il die if they can' t .
he had a way to calm me with his words .
i couldn' t tell half the time if he was talking ... or you were reading his mind .
why don' t we go see him ?
who ?
granddad and grandma .
maybe they don' t want us anyhow .
you ever think about that ?
they didn' t like dad' s style .
and then after mom died , they stopped showing up .
she really got a nice voice , though .
she gets the right break , she' il be here in a hurry .
what year was that ?
that was just last year that this picture was taken .
her brother is a corporate airplane pilot .
she' s 16 and he' s about 19 .
so young .
you love to see young people like that do so well ... because a lot of them don' t .
i did , too .
i used to have two ....
tim !
scoot over .
this is medicine for intestinal problems .
can you hold it down ?
make you better .
i' m thinking we should stay here for a while .
just until you get a little better , okay ?
until your medicine starts working .
what does it taste like ?
you' re getting weak .
if you get weak , you got to tell me .
how' s that now ?
is it good ?
it' s deel .
move .
this way !
god damn it .
chris !
why don' t you boys come out and let me look at you ?
we' re family , right ?
family looks after each other .
protects each other .
they even forgive each other .
i' m here to ask for your forgiveness .
chris !
chris , look what you' re putting tim through .
running him around .
let' s stop all this .
i was thinking about dad ... how he spoke to us ...
iike he was afraid .
when he looked me in the eye ...
sometimes ...
i believe he had no idea who i was .
or didn' t care .
who was this kid ?
how did he spring from me ?
i like the questions you ask yourself .
it' s my money .
violet , are you okay ?
i am .
he' s an asshole .
can we please get out of here ?
you' re bleeding .
yeah .
thanks .
that' s gus .
hey , gus .
hey .
i want , like , a thousand babies .
a whole force of them , so that you' re a team and when you walk anywhere ... people always have to pay attention to you .
but maybe some more boys than girls , because ....
where are you from ?
nowhere .
he' s not doing so good .
he' il fight it off .
he always does .
here .
you got something to write with ?
i met this gypsy once .
she told me that you write down a wish .
like whatever you want most in the world .
you write it down .
here .
don' t tell me what it is , okay ?
then you put it in here .
don' t look at mine .
put it in here .
you see this river ?
it goes to the ocean .
and so you throw your bottle in the ocean .
well , you don' t , you throw it in the river ... and if it makes it all the way to the ocean , then everything comes true .
but a lot can go wrong ... because it could just get pulled down .
something could pull it down .
have you seen them ?
i ain' t seen them .
i' il make it worth your while .
where did you get that book ?
well ?
your bag is right there , if that' s what you' re looking for .
what are you doing ?
those belonged to my dad .
they' re worth a lot .
i figured you could use them .
i ain' t got nowhere to go .
no one to be with me .
see ?
where did you say you were from ?
i didn' t know if i' d ever see you again , chris .
gather up them coins , boy .
do it .
i said gather up them coins , boy .
i ain' t your boy .
you know , chris ... your ma and me , we had some beautiful good times .
don' t talk about her .
we had some beautiful nights , boy .
and you were gonna be our gift to each other .
you don' t know nothing !
i know your daddy , that stranger he always saw in you , chris ... was because you weren' t his .
you' re my seed , and he had no right .
no right at all .
now , let' s take them coins and let' s start over , just you and me .
chris !
come on .
tim !
come on .
come one , tim !
run !
wait !
are you okay ?
come on !
i can' t .
he can' t .
he' s too ....
you have to keep up .
now go .
come on .
hide !
here , stay down , okay ?
keep still .
i' il get help .
come on .
you want this ?
just hand them to me , chris .
nobody gets them .
frickin ' ....
i used to get confused .
i used to get confused where things begin and when they end .
or what happens before and after .
what about mom and dad ?
did they cross the river ?
are they watching us now ?
where will i go ?
sometimes i wonder if i' m superstitious .
do i believe in broken mirrors , demons , and curses ?
because sometimes , it' s a comfort .
everything is okay .
you' re safe with us now .
grandpa ... he' s awake .
you' re safe with us now .
the doctor said you almost could have drowned .
how you feel ?
coins .
coins .
you cold ?
your grandmother is gonna cook us up some good food ... and i want you to eat real good .
will you do that for me ?
hell , yeah .
you ever eat any alligator ?
it' s good .
makes you strong .
they been around 200 million years .
what about venison ?
buffalo ?
they' re all good for you .
we' il have all that .
your grandmother can cook so good ... makes your tongue turn around and slap your brains .
