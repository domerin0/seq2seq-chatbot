in 1935 , ed murrow began his career with cbs .
when world war two broke out ... ... his voice brought the battle of britain home to us ... ... through his " this is london " radio series .
he started with us all ... ... many of us here tonight , when television was in its infancy ... ... with the news documentary show , " see it now " .
he threw stones at giants .
segregation , exploitation of migrant workers ... ... apartheid , j. edgar hoover ... ... not the least of which , his historical fight with senator mccarthy .
he is the host of our enormously popular show " person to person " ... ... and tonight he is here with his son , casey ... ... wife , janet , and all of you who he' s worked with ... ... inspired , lectured , and taught .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... the radio television news directors ' association and foundation welcomes ... ... mr. edward r. murrow .
this might just do nobody any good .
at the end of this discourse a few people may accuse this reporter ... ... of fouling his own comfortable nest ... ... and your organization may be accused of having given hospitality ... ... to heretical and even dangerous ideas .
but the elaborate structure of networks ... ... advertising agencies , and sponsors will not be shaken or altered .
it is my desire , if not my duty , to try to talk to you journeymen ... ... with some candor about what is happening to radio and television .
and if what i say is responsible ... ... i alone am responsible for the saying of it .
our history will be what we make of it .
and if there are any historians about 50 or 100 years from now ... ... and there should be preserved ... ... the kinescopes of one week of all three networks ... ... they will there find recorded in black and white , and in color ... ... evidence of decadence , escapism ... ... and insulation from the realities of the world in which we live .
we are currently wealthy , fat , comfortable , and complacent .
we have a built in allergy to unpleasant or disturbing information .
our mass media reflect this .
but unless we get up off our fat surpluses ... ... and recognize that television in the main ... ... is being used to distract , delude , amuse , and insulate us ... ... then television and those who finance it ... ... those who look at it and those who work at it ... ... may see a totally different picture too late .
millie !
just the person i wanted to see !
come here !
this goes at the top of the roy campanella piece .
yes !
give me a half an hour .
i may need it a little quicker than that !
can i get some coffee first ?
come on !
get me some coffee !
morning , johnny !
i have some new notes that go with the tito footage for fred .
fred' s gonna be in in an hour .
i already put them on his desk .
can you just make sure that ... ... he doesn' t look at the film until he reads the notes ?
yes .
thank you .
hey , joe !
shirley !
what' s going on in here ?
what do you mean ?
two attractive people alone in the copy room !
don' t tell paley , he' il fire me .
he' il fire both of us , shirley .
rules are made to be broken !
you can afford to say that .
let me see this .
it' s simply a loyalty oath .
to cbs ?
and to america .
you promise to be a loyal american ?
i know .
all of the reporters have signed this .
who are you promising this to ?
cbs ?
fred signed it .
murrow signed it .
murrow signed it ?
yeah .
are you now or have you ever been ...
i thought it was a joke , but there' s a lot of pressure . ... on the attorney general' s list of subversive groups ?
i don' t know .
let' s think about it .
what is it really saying ?
is it a civil liberties issue or censorship ?
am i simply stating to cbs that i' m not a communist ?
murrow signed this ?
and fred and stanton .
maybe you should talk to murrow .
maybe i should sign it .
if you don' t sign this , are you and i a target ?
if i don' t sign it , they' il fire me .
sign it .
finally we can tell everyone the truth .
if i could express it in what' s in my heart now ... ... i' d do it in the terms of the poet who once said ... ... " ah , ' tis but a dainty flower i bring to you .
yes , ' tis but a violet ... " " ... glistening with dew .
but still in its heart there lie beauties concealed .
so in our heart ...
... our love for you ... " " ... lies unrevealed .
i used to ...
... pride myself on the idea that i was a bit ... tough ... ... especially over the past 18 19 months , when we' ve been ... ... kicked around , and bullwhipped , and damned .
i didn' t think that ... ... i could be ... touched very deeply .
okay , that' s enough .
that' s enough , leo .
it' s short .
how long is the piece ?
it' s 4 minutes , but we can cut it down .
it can' t stand alone , but it might be a nice companion piece .
let' s go through this one more time .
palmer !
yep , got a call from the office of senator morse this morning ... ... interested in setting up a debate possibly with senator kerr ... ... over the comments bentsen made on last night' s show .
secretary of agriculture ?
good idea !
can they do it by this week ?
no , it would have to be 2 weeks at the earliest ... ... depending on morse' s schedule .
but still it' s a great idea .
let' s follow up on that .
hoover speaks on benjamin franklin .
we' re having better luck with mr. benjamin franklin ... ... than with mr. hoover .
it may progress better as a " person to person " .
at home with ben franklin .
his electricity awards .
we' ve got the footage , we need to contact him .
see if you can contact him and get the shot .
he wants to do the story .
joe !
member delbert clark ?
no longer with us .
new york times ?
yeah .
our friend at the times .
this was yesterday morning , they' re saying it' s ...
how old was he ?
53 .
sudden illness .
home of a friend .
no , it' s not an obit piece .
natalie send some flowers over there from us .
couple things .
case before the supreme court ... ... involving the constitutionality of a section of the internal security act ... ... provides for the deportation of any alien ... ... if he becomes a communist after entering this country .
can you take this ?
all right .
mccarthy interrupting his wedding trip ... ... to take charge of the investigation of communist infiltration ...
natalie , send some flowers .
poor mrs. mccarthy !
may i finish ?
it' s national security !
a real ladies ' man !
well , they' re in love .
we have no show for tuesday , fellows .
so get out there and make some news .
rob a bank .
mug an old lady .
do something .
you look at the secretary stevens footage ?
we will .
watch it all the way to the end , it' s worth it .
thank you , john .
there' s not much there .
i can' t tie it to the eisenhower in the back of the train piece .
you ever spend any time in detroit , fred ?
not recently .
there' s a story here in the detroit news , dexter , michigan .
a kid named milo radulovich .
italian ?
irish .
air force kicked him out because his dad ... ... read some serbian newspaper .
was he a communist ?
i don' t know .
who brought the charges ?
air force .
charges were in a sealed envelope , nobody saw them .
not even at the hearing ?
he was declared guilty without a trial ... ... and told if he wanted to keep his job ... ... he had to denounce his father and his sister .
thank you , natalie .
his sister ?
he told them to take a hike .
let' s send joe and charlie down there , see if he' s any good on camera .
is he being brought before the committee ?
no .
then it' s not mccarthy .
isn' t it ?
milo radulovich .
what happens to your children ... ... your 5 year old and your 5 month old in terms of you ?
if i am being judged on my relatives ... ... are my children going to be asked to denounce me ?
are they going to be judged on what their father was labeled ?
are they going to have to explain to their friends , etc ... ... why their father is a security risk ?
if the thing is let stand as it , the first recommendation ... ... was sent out by the board , i see a chain reaction that ... ... has no end to anybody , for anybody .
well , that' s new .
you can' t call this a neutral piece .
the other side' s been represented rather well for the last 2 years .
the air force hasn' t gone on the record .
so you want to forego the standards you' ve stuck to for 15 years ... ... both sides , no commentary .
we all editorialize .
i' m just making sure we identify what ...
we' re giving them the information up front ... ... and we' re asking them to comment on it .
frank , hold on .
i' ve searched my conscience .
i can' t for the life of me find any justification for this .
i simply cannot accept that there are , on every story ... ... two equal and logical sides to an argument .
call it editorializing , if you' d like .
it is editorializing .
they' il have equal time to defend themselves .
do you understand the position you' re putting us in ?
we are all in this together , if the senate wants to investigate ...
do me a favor ... ... avoid any big speeches about how we' re all in a big boat together !
please , don' t insult me .
i have to go back to mr. paley and alcoa , who sponsors your show ... ... and also have some military contracts ... ... and i have to tell them that they' re going to be in a tough bind ... ... because of a beef you had with joe mccarthy .
we' re not going at mccarthy .
you' re starting the goddamn fire .
excuse me .
mr. friendly , there' s a colonel anderson to see you ?
colonel ?
he' s in your office .
there are two of them .
maybe they liked the transcript , and want to compliment us on it .
excuse me .
go after joe kennedy .
we' il pay for it .
i' ve got a great story about hoover .
you know how many shows you' re going to have to do ... ... to make up for this ?
and judy and her daughter liza next week .
no , no .
you' re interviewing rin tin tin !
i' il talk to mr. paley .
alcoa won' t pay for the ads .
and we probably won' t either .
but nobody' il stop you .
how much are the ads ?
3, 000 .
i' il split it with fred .
he just won' t have christmas presents for his kids this year .
he' s a jew .
don' t tell him that , he loves christmas .
to be clear , you did speak with the lawyers ?
yes , we did .
and we read the transcript .
we' ve not been allowed to see the footage .
mack is on a plane from dexter right now with the last interviews .
we' il be going right down to the wire .
your show airs tomorrow .
how can we possibly approve and check ... ... your story in the limited amount of time you have given us ?
with all due respect , you have been invited to participate in this piece ... ... not to approve it .
we are going with the story that says that the u. s. air force ... ... tried milo radulovich without any evidence ... ... and found him guilty of being a security risk ... ... without his constitutional rights ...
you have not seen the evidence ... ... and are claiming he' s not a security risk .
wouldn' t you guess that those who have seen the contents of that envelope ... ... might have a better idea of what makes someone a danger to his country ?
who ?
who ?
or do you think it should just be you that decides ?
who are the people ?
are they elected ?
are they appointed ?
do they have an axe to grind ?
is it you , sir ?
or you , colonel jenkins ?
do you know the contents of that sealed envelope ?
we have been a friend and ally of both mr. murrow and cbs news for many years .
the story you are going to run tomorrow is without merit .
so before you take any steps that cannot be undone ... ... i strongly urge you to reconsider your stand .
these are very dangerous waters you are attempting to navigate .
we have had no hearing at all .
we have had no day in court .
in all the 32 years that i have been a practicing attorney in detroit ... ... i have never witnessed such a farce and travesty upon justice ... ... as this thing has developed .
now this whole theory ...
eddie , just take the first reel .
tell john i left 5 seconds extra leader .
5 seconds !
i got it !
palmer , where' s joe ?
have you seen joe ?
he' s on his way to the control room .
we' re gonna have to do the voice over live .
natalie , i need a booth with a live mic .
booth is there , it' s already set .
we didn' t have time to sync the voice over out .
that' s not what i asked for .
it' s missing the voice over on the last piece .
there' s a commercial in the booth .
what shall i do ?
2 minutes to air !
there' s not supposed to be a commercial !
get him out of the booth !
2 and a half minutes on the end piece .
keep it down , please .
it' s a little loud .
2 minutes to air , fellas .
he' s gonna add a joke .
charlie , loan me your lighter .
make sure you know that i swap with those two pieces of parents .
as long as he talks fast because ...
he will talk fast .
we got the film .
will it be ready ?
you bet .
funny thing , freddy !
every time you light a cigarette for me , i know you' re lying .
it occurs to me we might not get away with this one .
alcoa , the aluminum company of america ...
10 seconds .
you fellas , ready ?
okay .
ready on camera 1 .
5 , 4 , 3 , 2 .
pan , camera 1 .
good evening .
a few weeks ago there occurred a few obscure notices in the newspapers ... ... about milo radulovich ... ... a lieutenant in the air force reserves .
and , also , something about air force regulation 35 62 ... ... which states that a man may be regarded as a security risk ... ... if he has close and continuing association with communists ... ... or people believed to have communist sympathies .
lieutenant radulovich was asked to resign in august .
he declined .
a board was called and heard his case .
at the end it was recommended that he be severed from the air force ... ... although it was also stated that there was no question whatever ... ... as to the lieutenant' s loyalty .
we propose to examine , in so far as we can ... ... the case of lieutenant radulovich .
our reporter , joe wershba , cameraman , charlie mack .
this is the town of dexter , michigan .
population 1500 .
this statue is at the end of ann arbor street erected by ...
what did the general tell you yesterday ?
a colonel .
there were two of them .
that makes a general .
they weren' t too pleased .
you' re gonna get audited this year .
not me , you .
i told them i didn' t want to do the story .
you always were yellow .
better than red .
in 10 seconds .
this is the sister , margaret radulovich fishman .
she neither defends nor explains her political activities .
i feel that my activities , be what they may ... ... or my political beliefs are my own private affair .
are my children going to be asked to denounce me ?
are they going to be judged on what their father was labeled ?
are they going to have to explain to their friends , etc ... ... why their father is a security risk ?
i see , absolutely , that this is a chain reaction .
if the thing is let stand as it , the first recommendation ... ... was sent out by the board i see a chain reaction ... ... that has no end to anybody , for anybody .
perhaps you will permit me to read a few sentences ... ... because i would like to say rather precisely what i mean .
we have told the air force that we will provide facilities ... ... for any comments , criticisms , or corrections it may wish to make ... ... as to the case of milo radulovich .
we are unable to judge the charges against his father or sister ... ... because neither we , nor you , nor they , nor the lawyers ... ... nor the lieutenant , know what was contained in that manila envelope .
was it hearsay , rumor , gossip , slander ... ... or hard ascertainable facts that could be backed by credible witnesses ?
we do not know .
we believe the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father .
even though that iniquity be proved and in this case it was not .
but we believe too that this case illustrates the urgent need ... ... for the armed forces to communicate more fully than they have so far done ... ... the procedures and regulations to be followed ... ... in attempting to protect the national security ... ... and the rights of the individual at the same time .
whatever happens in this area of the relationship ... ... between the individual and the state ... ... we will do it ourselves ... ... it cannot be blamed on malenkov or mao tse tung or even our allies .
and , it seems to us , fred friendly and myself ... ... that this is a subject that should be argued about endlessly .
good night , and good luck .
and we' re out .
may i tell you something about yourself ...
may i tell you something about yourself ... ... as a member of the " person to person " audience ?
based on audience research studies ... ... you are well above average in education and intelligence .
your interests are wide , from world affairs and science ... ... to sports and show business .
and you have one characteristic that' s rather encouraging to me ... ... and that' s the fact that you are not easily persuaded by advertising .
the makers of kent considered all these characteristics ... ... when they chose mr. murrow' s program ... ... to tell you about kent .
of all leading filter cigarettes , kent filters best .
if you try kent with that in mind , i think you' il agree ... ... with many other thinking people who have changed to kent .
they find that it makes good sense to smoke kent and good smoking , too .
did you get the changes ?
edward murrow , " person to person " ... ... on the cbs television network .
no , no .
you there ?
okay .
we got it .
now back to ed murrow .
not since the silent movies and the idols they produced ... ... has hollywood witnessed the sort of pilgrimage that is now going on .
each day , oblivious to time , weather , and the state of the world ... ... sightseers head in the direction of california' s san fernando valley .
for there , at the end of the tourist line , is sherman oaks ... ... and the home liberace has built for himself and his mother .
this is the front and nobody knows how many people have seen that view .
this is the back of the house and that' s liberace' s bedroom .
good evening , lee .
good evening , ed .
what are you doing ?
i' m dictating my weekly syndicated newspaper column ... ... and on my trusty tape recorder here , i' m also dictating a book .
it' s an inspirational book .
lee , what about you ?
have you given much thought to getting married and settling down ?
actually , i' ve given a lot of thought to it ... ... but i don' t believe in getting married just for the sake of getting married .
i want to some day find the perfect mate ... ... and settle down to what i hope will be a marriage that will be blessed ... ... by faith and will be a lasting union .
i was reading about lovely young princess margaret ... ... and she' s looking for her dream man , too ... ... and i hope she finds him some day .
uh huh .
lee , thanks very much for letting us come and visit you .
it' s been very pleasant .
and will you say good night to your family for us ?
i certainly will .
thanks a lot .
good night , ed .
good night , lee .
next week , we' il take you to beverly hills , california ... ... to the house of mickey rooney and his new bride .
until then , good night , and good luck .
good show , mr. murrow !
excuse me , mr. murrow .
could you take a look at this and sign it for me , please ?
thank you .
dr. stanton would like to have a drink with you .
when ?
now .
he' s at the pentagon bar .
i can' t .
what the hell is he doing there ?
i believe he' s waiting for you .
just call him !
fine .
oppenheimer next week .
it' s a good show , ed .
hey , don !
ed !
you' re getting good at this !
they' re gonna think you like it !
pays the bills .
how are you , don ?
ah , it' s ... ... day to day .
if she saw how good you look right now , she' d be back .
you tell her that if you see her , will you ?
i read the o' brian piece .
yeah , it' s tough .
i' m a pinko .
i slant the news .
i' m just waiting for him to say my wife left me too .
nobody worth their salt reads him .
you read him .
well , see , i rest my case .
does paley read him ?
bill paley' s not gonna do anything .
thanks , ed .
i just came by to tell you how great the lieutenant piece was .
thanks .
how' s the fallout ?
mostly good , surprisingly .
is this the start ?
are you taking sides ?
it' s just a little poke with a stick , see what happens .
you let me know if i can help .
but you' re a pinko .
i' il see you .
hey , joe !
what' s all this radulovich junk you' re putting out ?
i can' t talk to you now .
i have to get this film back to new york .
what would you say if i told you ... ... that murrow was on the soviet payroll in 1935 ?
uh !
charlie , you wanna ...
sure .
i' il set up outside .
mccarthy going to the eisenhower dinner ?
i have no idea .
i don' t keep the senator' s calendar for him !
really ?
have you ever seen any spy films ?
you don' t hand me a classified folder !
you' re supposed to slip it into my briefcase !
i didn' t know who to give this information to , paley or murrow .
as you can imagine , fred and i aren' t very friendly .
no pun intended .
no pun elocuted .
what do you got , donald ?
in short ?
murrow' s been a communist sympathizer since the 1930' s .
member of the international workers , sponsored educational trips to moscow ... ... and on the soviet payroll in 1935 .
it' s all there .
you wanna know why that' s not possible ?
why you' il lose this one ?
because everyone in this country ... ... knows that ed murrow is a loyal american , he' s a patriot .
did you know the word " gullible " isn' t in the dictionary ?
can i give this to him ?
i' d love it !
i have copies !
i think you guys go too far .
well , if it walks like a duck , talks like a duck .
yes , mr. paley .
right away .
yes , sir .
no , he hasn' t called .
yes , sir , the second he calls .
if you' re in a meeting , shall i ?
yes , sir .
of course , sir .
mr. murrow !
mr. paley will see you now .
mr. paley , mr. murrow is here .
thanks , miss mary .
hello , ed .
bill ...
sit over here , will you ?
how' s janet ?
your son ?
all well , thanks .
how' s babe ?
she' s fine .
her fundraiser got rained on , so ...
oh !
that' s why i never plan on anything .
really ?
you' d never know .
reading fiction ?
i hope so .
you tell me .
now we know how they' re gonna come at us .
that' s just the first shot .
somebody' s going to go down .
have you checked your facts ?
are you on safe ground ?
bill , it' s time .
show our cards .
my cards .
you lose , what happens ?
5 guys find themselves out of work .
i' m responsible for a lot more than 5 goddamn reporters .
let it go .
mccarthy will self destruct , cohn , all of them .
you said corporate would not interfere with editorial ... ... and that the news was to be left ...
we don' t make the news , we report the news .
99 % of the time he' s wrong about those he' s marked as communists .
if he goes too far , the senate will investigate him ... ... and we will report on that .
but he' s wrong 100 % of the time when he oversteps people' s civil liberties .
and you' re trying him in the press ?
does he get the right to face his accuser ?
you' ve decided on this and you' re presenting it as fact .
what i am doing ...
i write your check .
i put you in your country house , and i put your son through school !
you should have told me about this before it went so far down the road !
everyone of your boys needs to be clean .
do you understand ?
no ties .
if aaron' s mother went to a group fundraiser in 1932 , he' s out .
hewitt , too .
anyone in that room .
you make no mistake ... ... i will cut them loose .
corporate won' t interfere with editorial .
but editorial will not jeopardize the hundreds of employees ... ... of the cbs .
do i make myself clear ?
yes ?
fellas , our next show is gonna be about senator mccarthy .
and we' re gonna go right at him .
i don' t need to tell you how careful we have to be .
if we are to do this , ed and i need you to be straight with us .
we need to know , for the good of the piece ... ... if any of you have any connection , if you subscribed to a newsletter ... ... if you attended a party , anything ... ... anything that could compromise this , anything at all ... ... because now would be the time to tell us .
ed , i think i should excuse myself .
palmer , you kidding ?
my ex was a ...
i wouldn' t say she was a communist ... ... but she attended meetings .
it was before we were married .
i didn' t even really know about it until after the divorce .
but it was different then .
we were all on the same side .
i' m not telling you anything you don' t know .
the thing is ... ... somebody' il find out .
they' il hurt us with it .
i should have told you sooner , ed , i' m sorry .
fred .
if none of us had ever read a " dangerous " book ... ... or had a friend who was " different " ... ... or never joined an organization that advocated " change " ... ... we' d all be the kind of people joe mccarthy wants .
we' re gonna go with the story , because the terror is in this room .
john !
jesse !
go through the huac hearings .
eddie !
palmer !
look at who did the interviews and any speeches .
okay , fellas , here we go .
his own words , that' s what we need . ... said that he wouldn' t remove a general from the army ... ... who supported a communist major .
i said , " then , general ... " " ... you should be removed from any command .
any man who says , ' i will protect and honor a general ' ... " " ... ' who protects communists ' , is not fit to wear that uniform , general .
ethically , we' re fine .
but legally , if we air this , are we leaking closed hearing testimony ?
but he chose to read it .
we' re not misquoting him .
there are other reporters .
if it' s a legal issue , it' s his .
i' il check with campbell in legal .
and wait till you hear the bleeding hearts ... ... scream and cry about our methods ... ... of trying to drag the truth ... ... from those who know or should know ... ... who covered up a fifth amendment communist major .
but they say , " oh ... " " ... it' s all right to uncover them , but don' t get rough doing it , mccarthy .
did a civil liberties union provide you with an attorney at that time ?
i had many offers of attorneys ... ... and from the american civil liberties union , too .
the questions is : ... did the civil liberties union supply you with an attorney ?
they did supply an attorney .
the answer is yes ?
the answer is yes .
you know the civil liberties union has been listed ... ... as a front for and doing the work of the communist party ?
mr. chairman , this was 1932 !
i know this was in 1932 .
do you know that they since have been listed ... ... as a front for and doing the work of the communist party ?
i do not know that they have been listed so , sir .
you don' t know ?
i have heard that mentioned ...
all right , leo .
turn it off .
i need those three cans of stevens !
has anybody read this book yet ?
it would be nice if this guy isn' t a commie .
did millie give it to you ?
i wanna read the book .
nobody else , joe .
i hear you , boss .
i' il put it on a kinescope , push through the end .
palmer , cut it at 2 : 30 .
i prefer it one on each end , let it run through .
it' d be more powerful .
cut kennedy ?
joe , file it for me .
i' il see the mundt piece later .
are we gonna make it , fred ?
we lost the telecine , but we' il make it .
did you finish your closing piece ?
it' s shakespeare .
write your closing .
my argument was if you just show the images of mccarthy ... ... it doesn' t make any difference .
if you agree with him , you' re gonna hate the piece .
if you don' t , you' il love it .
maybe they should wait till they get more footage .
i don' t think we can take that chance .
we' ve got to hit mccarthy before he comes after ed .
the blue one .
they haven' t gone after the alsops or herb block .
honey , the alsops and herb block ... ... didn' t work for the institute of international education in 1934 .
then i guess it' s time .
you worried ?
i didn' t think i was .
i don' t know why .
i was in the office on friday .
and i answered the phone , it was howard calling from london .
and he asked what was going on with mccarthy .
and before i answered him , i turned and looked over my shoulder ... ... to see who was listening .
and who was listening ?
chairman mao ...
i' il see you at the office .
hey , your ring !
uh !
name me another wife ... ... who reminds her husband to take off his wedding ring ... ... before he goes to the office .
ava gardner .
excuse me , mr. friendly .
mr. murrow , mr. paley' s on the line for you .
maybe he wants to reimburse us for those ads .
you' d like that !
i would like that !
this is ed .
there' s a knickerbocker game tonight .
i' ve got front row seats .
are you interested ?
i' m busy bringing down the network tonight , bill .
is that tonight ?
we' re covered , bill .
all right .
i' m with you today , ed , and i' m with you tomorrow .
thanks , bill .
do you know the timing on the first piece ?
can we hold all the calls , please ?
hold the calls till after the show .
thank you .
you fellas , awake down there ?
okay .
just ... what are we ?
20 ?
30 seconds , ed .
10 seconds .
5 , 4 , 3 , 2 .
and pan , camera one .
because a report on senator mccarthy is by definition controversial ... ... we want to say exactly what we mean to say ... ... and request your permission to read from a script ... ... whatever remarks murrow and friendly may make .
if the senator feels that we have done violence to his words or pictures ... ... and desires to answer himself ... ... an opportunity will be afforded him on this program .
our working thesis tonight is this quotation : ... " if this fight against communism ... " " ... has made a fight between america' s two great political parties ... " " ... the american people know that one of these parties will be destroyed ... " " ... and the republic cannot endure very long as a one party system .
we applaud that statement ... ... and we think senator mccarthy ought to .
he said it 17 months ago in milwaukee .
the american people realize that this cannot be made a fight ... ... between america' s two great political parties .
if this fight against communism ... ... is made a fight against america' s two great political parties ... ... the american people know that one of those parties will be destroyed ... ... and the republic can' t endure very long as a one party system .
on one thing the senator has been consistent .
often operating as a one man committee , he has traveled far ... ... interviewed many , terrorized some ... ... accused civilian and military leaders ... ... of the past administration of a great conspiracy ... ... to turn over the country to communism .
i was extremely shocked when i heard that secretary stevens ... ... told 2 army officers that they had to take part in the cover up ... ... of those who promoted and coddled communists .
as i read his statement , i ... ... thought of that quotation , " on what meat ... " " ... doth this our caesar feed ? " .
the questions is : ... did the civil liberties union supply you with an attorney ?
they did supply an attorney .
the answer is yes ?
the answer is yes .
do you think this book did considerable harm ?
its publication ... ... by an expression of the views contained in it ?
the sale of that book was so abysmally small ... ... it was so unsuccessful , that the question of its influence ...
you can go back to the publisher ... ... you' il see it was one of the most unsuccessful books he ever put out .
he' s still sorry about it , just as i am .
well , i think that' s a compliment to american intelligence .
i' il say that .
the reed harris hearing demonstrates one of the senator' s techniques .
twice he said ... ... " the american civil liberties union was listed as a subversive front .
the attorney general' s list does not and never has listed ... ... the aclu as subversive , nor does the fbl ... ... or any other federal government agency .
and the american civil liberties union holds in its files ... ... letters of commendation from president truman ... ... president eisenhower , and general macarthur .
earlier , the senator asked , " upon what meat does this our caesar feed ? " .
had he looked three lines earlier in shakespeare' s " caesar " ... ... he would have found this line , which is not altogether inappropriate .
the fault , dear brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves .
no one familiar with the history of this country ... ... can deny that congressional committees are useful .
it is necessary to investigate before legislating ... ... but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one ... ... and the junior senator from wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly .
we must not confuse dissent with disloyalty .
we must remember always that accusation is not proof ... ... and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law .
we will not walk in fear , one of another .
we will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason ... ... if we dig deep in our history and doctrine ... ... and remember that we are not descended from fearful men ... ... not from men who feared to write , to associate , to speak ... ... and to defend the causes that were for the moment unpopular .
this is no time for men who oppose senator mccarthy' s methods ... ... to keep silent , or for those who approve .
we can deny our heritage and our history ... ... but we cannot escape responsibility for the results .
we proclaim ourselves , indeed as we are ... ... the defenders of freedom wherever it continues to exist in the world ... ... but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home .
the actions of the junior senator from wisconsin ... ... have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad ... ... and given considerable comfort to our enemies .
and whose fault is that ?
not really his .
he didn' t create this situation of fear ... ... he merely exploited it , and rather successfully .
cassius was right .
the fault , dear brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves .
good night , and good luck .
and we' re out .
nothing ?
maybe nobody watched .
we got nothing .
i don' t know .
nothing .
should i turn the phones back on , mr. williams ?
yes .
now would be a good time for that .
turn the phones on !
turn the pho ...
mr. friendly wants the phones on .
it' s the junior senator calling collect .
don' t kid yourself .
it' s reed harris thanking us for mentioning him .
i don' t know whether all of you have seen what i just saw ... ... but i want to associate myself and this program ... ... with what ed murrow has just said ... ... and say i have never been prouder of cbs .
senator mccarthy said today that he would demand equal free television ...
stevenson had charged that the senator made demagoguery and deceit ... ... the national policy ...
is that hollenbeck ?
congratulations !
great show !
feel like a scotch ?
i think everybody could use a scotch .
it' s 3 : 30 , early editions are out .
i' m not worried about that .
of course not .
shirley , honey ... ... would you go across the street and get the early editions ?
all of them ?
just get o' brian !
hey , watch my drink !
yeah .
okay .
here we go .
at last !
the times .
the times ...
first ?
good .
who wrote it ?
jack gould .
gould ...
edward r. murrow' s television program on senator joseph r. mccarthy ... ... was an exciting and provocative examination of the man and his methods .
it was crusading journalism of high responsibility and courage .
for tv so often plagued by timidity and hesitation ... ... the program was a milestone that reflected enlightened citizenship .
the program ...
hold on !
the program was no less an indictment of those who wish ... ... the problems posed by the senator' s tactics and theatrics ... ... would just go away and leave them alone .
that was mr. murrow' s and television' s triumph ... ... and a very great one .
here !
here !
he hated it .
yeah .
what' s his beef ?
send the new york times a bottle of scotch .
i already did .
how do you think we got that review ?
how' s the post ?
pretty good !
what about o' brian ?
uh , the same .
go on , read o' brian !
i don' t have it .
got it .
oh .
here .
there we go .
shirley , that ...
we can' t say we were surprised at murrow' s " hate mccarthy " telecast ... ... last evening , when his explosively one sided propaganda ... ... edited with deviously clever selectivity from mccarthy' s march ... ... against communism , was finished last evening ... ... by equally machiavellian coincidence the following telecast ... ... featured murrow' s pm protg , hollenbeck .
in an obviously gloating mood , hollenbeck ... ... hoped viewers had witnessed his patron' s triumph ... ... from and for the left .
so on .
so on ...
shirley , it' s okay .
go ahead , finish it .
no , that' s it .
that' s it .
shirley , please , finish it .
the cbs has been in a lengthy " clean house of lefties " mood .
the worst offenders on lesser levels ... ... have been quietly pushed out of the company .
don hollenbeck , a graduate of the demised pinko publication pm ... ... attacked conservative papers with sly and slanted propaganda .
he then proceeded through an equally ... ... tilted review of the day' s events ... ... with mccarthy dominating his words , actions , attitudes .
so on .
it' s o' brian .
he didn' t get the scotch , that' s all .
is it grammatically correct ?
i' il have that cigarette , ed .
thanks , shirley .
oh .
mmh .
thank you .
joe ...
shirley ...
it doesn' t matter .
to jack gould !
to jack !
to jack !
to jack gould !
to jack gould !
i love jack gould !
may he rest in peace .
hello , jimmy .
fred , congratulations !
thank you .
i got such a hangover to go along with the ulcer .
all the ad guys on the 3rd floor watched the show .
got a good review in the new york times .
jack gould .
we' re putting out a press release ... ... saying that calls came in 15 to 1 in favor of the show .
really ?
yeah .
15 to 1 ?
we got calls from everywhere .
east coast or west coast ?
yeah .
kansas city , cincinnati ...
mr. paley ...
morning , fred .
morning , mr. paley .
how' s your wife ?
she' s fine .
we' re getting ready to move .
really ?
where to ?
riverdale .
we found a nice house there .
it' s nice there .
yes , sir .
excuse me .
fred !
mccarthy wants william buckley to do his rebuttal .
i said no .
yes , sir .
hey , johnny !
radulovich has been reinstated .
what ? !
radulovich ...
guys !
radulovich has been reinstated .
jesse !
jesse !
where is ed ?
he' s in the bullpen .
why ?
what' s going on ?
jess !
got some very good news .
special announcement from the secretary of the air force !
fellas !
listen up !
everyone !
i have decided that it is consistent ... ... with the interests of the national security to retain ... ... lieutenant radulovich in the united states air force .
stop .
he is not , in my opinion , a security risk .
full stop .
there you go .
harold e. talbott , secretary from the air force .
great job !
make a copy of that for me !
i will do , fred !
back to work , guys !
we got a lot of work to do .
this means something .
good news , huh ?
congratulations !
this absolutely means something .
absolutely .
this is the start of ...
palmer !
the cbs lawyers wanna talk to you .
when ?
tomorrow .
i don' t want you to get paranoid , they' re talking to everybody .
any ideas ?
just tell them what you know .
now is that testimony true ?
no , sir , it is not .
not at any time have i been a member of the communist party ... ... and i have never seen a communist card .
you' ve never seen a communist card ?
that' s right .
have you ever attended any communist meetings ?
no , sir , never .
have you ever subscribed to the daily worker ?
no , sir .
i didn' t subscribe to it and i wouldn' t pay for it .
uh ...
now , mrs. markward , who was working for the fbl ... ... who joined the communist party under orders from the fbl ... ... has testified that while she never met you personally ... ... at a communist meeting that your name was on the list ... ... of communists who were paying dues .
uh ...
can you shed any light upon that ?
no , sir .
i don' t even know what the dues are ... ... or where they were paid .
so you have never paid any money ... ... to the communist party .
is that correct ?
that' s right .
you' ve never paid any dues , payment ...
thank you very much , leo !
good work , joe , charlie .
now what is the show ?
is it defending annie lee moss as not being a communist ?
or is it her constitutional rights ?
both .
the latter .
we' re much better sticking out the constitutional issues .
agreed ?
the woman is not a communist spy .
joe mccarthy said that they have a spy in the pentagon ... ... that spy has gotten into the code room ... ... and that that spy is annie lee moss .
i' ve got new york times reports .
mccarthy asserts he has ... ... a new red link to army .
quote , " senator mccarthy charged today ... " " ... that the army now employs a woman in its code room ... " " ... who was , and still may be , an active communist .
it' s the front page of the new york times .
no sooner is he done chastising the other committee members for wanting ... ... to push into the afternoon , than what ?
seven questions in ... ... he ducks out , leaves ...
right .
he leaves .
it' s all over the headlines , all over the country .
get me copies from any newspaper ... ... that printed anything about that assertion .
that' s a good idea .
you should get the cincinnati inquirer .
chicago .
couple other pieces i think we should include .
the fact that there' s 3 annie lee moss' s in the phone book .
there are 2 robert halls , one' s colored , one' s white .
we have some footage of the empty chair .
i think that says it all .
just that picture of mccarthy not ...
mccarthy leaving the hearing after 7 questions ... ... and then we' il cut to the shot of the chair .
we gotta do something about it .
all right , so ...
excuse me .
mr. murrow !
mccarthy wants april 6th .
thank you , natalie .
fine .
if charlie shoots it , we get to see it first .
we should offer .
it' s a long shot .
what the hell could mccarthy do ?
is he gonna debate himself ?
we just used his words !
johnny !
johnny !
we know what it' s going to be .
he' s going to come after me .
there' s nothing more he can do .
he' s gonna bet that a senator trumps a newsman .
he' il lose .
not if we' re playing bridge .
i' m sorry , guys .
i didn' t mean to interrupt .
hey , don .
it' s getting fun now !
ed , you have a minute ?
yes , i' il be right there .
all right , boys .
playtime' s over .
we have 4 days ... ... to do a 28 minute show .
yeah .
all right .
all right , go ahead .
hi , mary .
hello , mr. hollenbeck .
mr. murrow ...
could you give us a moment ?
sure .
thank you , dear .
i have to ask you something , ed .
it' s about o' brian .
o' brian doesn' t matter .
he' s killing me , ed .
he doesn' t amount to that much in the newsroom .
we' ve got to let that guy have it .
we' re not going after o' brian .
i will not take on mccarthy and hearst .
i can' t defeat them both .
just don' t read the papers .
or don' t read o' brian , anyway .
okay .
i guess not .
sorry , don .
although mrs. moss offered to testify ... ... senator mccarthy suggested that she was too sick .
she agreed ... mr. cohn wanted to know about mrs. moss' s connection ... ... to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth ... ... so help you god ?
may we get your full name for the record , please ?
annie lee moss .
m o s s ?
that' s right .
mrs. moss , let me say for the record , for your information ... ... for the information of your counsel ... ... that you are not here because ... ... you are considered important in the communist apparatus .
we have the testimony that you are , and have been , a communist .
we are rather curious , however , to know how you suddenly ... ... were shifted from ... ... a worker in a cafeteria to the code room .
i am today much more interested ... ... in the handling of your case ... ... by your superiors than in your own personal activities .
however , counsel will question you about your own activities also .
mr. chairman !
we will not hear from counsel .
you have been told what the rule is .
if you have anything to say , say it through your client .
chairman .
did you begin work at the general accounting office in ... ... 1945 ?
yes , sir .
and , prior to that time , had you been a cafeteria worker ?
yes , i had .
i see .
while in the pentagon , since 1950 ... ... have you had any connections with coded messages ?
have you ever handled coded messages ?
no more than to transmit ' em .
pardon me ?
no more than to transmit the message .
than to transmit them ?
did you transmit codes ?
to receive or transmit messages was all i had to do .
and i' ve never been into a courtroom in my life .
do you know the ... ... type of classification ...
do you know if they were secret , top secret , confidential ?
no , sir .
you wouldn' t know the degree of classification ?
no , sir .
i see .
i' m afraid i' m going to have to excuse myself , i' ve got ... ... a rather important appointment to work on right now ... ... and i wonder if , senator mundt , you would take over as chairman ?
chairman .
uh ...
cohn .
i have no further questions of this witness at this time .
we have the testimony of mrs. markward , the undercover agent for the fbl ... ... stating that annie lee moss was a member , a dues paying member ... ... of the communist party ... ... the northeast club of the communist party .
we have corroboration of that testimony by another ... ... witness who was called before the committee ... ... and gave a sworn statement to the effect ... ... that she also knew mrs. moss as a member ... ... of the northeast club of the communist party .
she' s already lost her job .
she' s been suspended because of this action .
i' m not defending her .
if she' s a communist , i want her exposed .
but to make these statements as we' ve got corroborating evidence ... ... that she is a communist , under these circumstances ... ... i think she' s entitled to have it produced here in her presence ... ... and let the public know about it and let her know about it .
i don' t like to try people by hearsay evidence .
i' d like to get the witnesses here and try them ... ... by testimony , under oath .
the chair will rule that the comment of mr. cohn ... ... be stricken from the record .
i didn' t ask that , mr. chairman ! ... whether we should try to produce a witness in public ... ... because the fbi may have her undercover and we don' t want to ...
you can' t strike these statements made by counsel here as to evidence ... ... that we' re having and withholding .
you cannot strike that from the press ... ... nor from the public mind once it' s planted there .
that' s the ... ... evil of it !
well , i' d look at it ...
i don' t think it' s fair to a witness ... ... to a citizen of this country ... ... to bring them up here and cross examine them ... ... then when they get through , say ... ... " the fbi has got something on you that condemns you .
the chair agrees ...
it is not sworn testimony ... ... it' s convicting people by rumor and hearsay and innuendo .
you will notice that neither senator mcclellan or senator symington ... ... nor this reporter know or claim that mrs. moss was or is a communist .
they simply claimed that she had the right to meet her accusers face to face .
they simply claimed that she had the right to meet her accusers face to face .
one month ago tonight we presented a report on senator joseph r. mccarthy .
we labeled it as controversial .
most of that report consisted of words and pictures of the senator .
at that time , we said ... ... " if the senator believes we have done violence to his words or pictures ... " " ... if he desires to speak , to answer himself ... " " ... an opportunity would be afforded him on this program .
the senator sought the opportunity after 3 weeks ... ... because he was very busy and wished adequate time to prepare his reply .
we agreed .
we placed no restrictions on the manner of the presentation of his reply ... ... and we suggested that we would not take time to comment ... ... on this particular program .
here now is senator joseph r. mccarthy , junior senator from wisconsin .
good evening .
mr. edward r. murrow , educational director of the cbs ... ... devoted his program to an attack ... ... on the work of the us senate investigating committee ... ... and on me personally as its chairman .
now , over the past 4 years , he has made repeated attacks upon me ... ... and those fighting communists .
of course , neither joe mccarthy nor edward r. murrow ... ... is of any great importance as individuals .
we are only important ... ... in our relation to the great struggle to preserve our american liberties .
now ordinarily , i wouldn' t take time out from the important work at hand ... ... to answer murrow .
however , in this case ... ... i feel justified in doing so because murrow is the symbol ... ... the leader ... ... and the cleverest of the jackal pack which is always found at the throat ... ... of anyone who dares to expose individual communists and traitors .
and i am compelled by the fact ... ... to say to you that mr. edward r. murrow ... ... as far back as 20 years ago ... ... was engaged in propaganda for communist causes .
for example , the institute of international education ... ... of which he was the acting director ... ... was chosen to act as a representative ... ... by a soviet agency ... ... to do a job which would normally be done by the russian secret police .
mr. murrow , by his own admission , was a member of the iww ... ... that' s the industrial workers of the world ... ... a terrorist organization cited as subversive ... ... by an attorney general of the united states .
mr. murrow said on this program and i quote ... ... " the actions of the junior senator from wisconsin ...
... have given considerable comfort to the enemy .
that is the language of our statute of treason , rather strong language .
if i am giving comfort to our enemies , i ought not to be in the senate .
if , on the other hand , mr. murrow ... ... is giving comfort to our enemies ... ... he ought not to be brought into the homes ... ... of millions of americans by the cbs .
and i want to assure you ... ... that i will not be deterred ... ... by the attacks of the murrows , the lattimores , the fosters ... ... the daily worker or the communist party itself .
and i make no claim to leadership .
in complete humility ... ... i do ask you and every american who loves this country ... ... to join with me .
alcoa , aluminum company of america . ]
last week , senator mccarthy appeared on this program ... ... to correct any errors he might have thought we made ... ... in our report of march 9th .
since he made no reference to any statements of fact that we made ... ... we must conclude that he found no errors of fact .
he proved again that anyone who exposes him ... ... anyone who doesn' t share his disregard for decency and human dignity ... ... and the rights guaranteed by the constitution ... ... must be either a communist or a fellow traveler .
i fully expected this treatment .
the senator added this reporter' s name to a long list of individuals ... ... and institutions he has accused of serving the communist cause .
his proposition is very simple : ... anyone who criticizes or opposes senator mccarthy' s methods ... ... must be a communist .
and if that be true , there are an awful lot of communists in the usa .
for the record , let' s consider briefly some of the senator' s charges .
he claimed , but offered no proof ... ... that i had been a member of the industrial workers of the world .
that is false .
i was never a member of the iww , never applied for membership .
the senator charged that professor harold laski ... ... a british scholar and politician , dedicated a book to me .
that' s true .
he is dead .
he was a socialist , i am not .
he was a civilized individual ... ... who did not insist upon agreement with his political principles ... ... as a pre condition for conversation or friendship .
i do not agree with his political ideas .
laski , as he makes clear in the introduction ... ... dedicated the book to me , not because of political agreement ... ... but because he held my wartime broadcast from london in high regard .
and the dedication so reads .
i believed 20 years ago and i believe today ... ... that mature americans can engage in conversation and controversy ... ... the clash of ideas , with communists anywhere in the world ... ... without becoming contaminated or converted .
i believe that our faith , our conviction ... ... our determination are stronger than theirs ... ... and that we can successfully compete , not only in the area of bombs ... ... but in the area of ideas .
i have worked with cbs for more than 19 years .
the company has subscribed fully to my integrity and responsibility ... ... as a broadcaster and as a loyal american .
i require no lectures from the junior senator from wisconsin ... ... as to the dangers or terrors of communism .
having searched my conscience and my files ... ... i cannot contend that i have always been right or wise ... ... but i have attempted to pursue the truth with diligence ... ... and to report it ... ... even though , as in this case , i had been warned in advance ... ... that i would be subjected to the attentions of senator mccarthy .
we shall hope to deal with matters of more vital interest next week .
good night , and good luck .
in the last analysis , the senator was perched on the television high dive ... ... and all prepared to make a resounding splash .
he jumped beautifully , but he neglected to check first ... ... where he was going to land .
it must have been a shock ... ... to discover that mr. murrow had drained the water out of the pool .
is that the times ?
gould ?
yeah , it' s jack gould .
he' s a hell of a writer .
yes , he is .
if we can afford him !
stanton' s got a public opinion ...
senate' s investigating mccarthy .
what ?
the army' s charging that mccarthy and cohn exercised undue pressure ... ... to get preferential treatment for schine .
who' s the source ?
got a second source ?
there isn' t , but this is coming out in 2 hours .
who' s heading up the investigation ?
it' s not gonna be mccarthy !
really ?
what happened ?
also get me the washington post !
what' s going on ?
it' s williams for jack thompson .
the senate' s investigating mccarthy .
there is an added bit of comedy to this whole story .
the committee cannot convene for several days ... ... because senator mccarthy has a slight case of laryngitis .
and he must recover over the desert air of arizona .
but stevens is going after him and it looks like joe welch .
yeah .
they' re gonna allow each side to call witnesses ... ... and be privy to other testimony .
fred , we still have a meeting !
we' re gonna go to talk to thompson .
no , thanks , jack .
bye .
freddy , we' re a hit .
right up there with " howdy dowdy " !
can i have an outlet satellite , please ?
74 , 76 , 47 .
thank you .
murrayville 3 , 1 2 7 6 .
the fact of newscaster don hollenbeck' s suicide yesterday ... ... does not remove from the record that peculiar history ... ... of the leftist slanting of news indulged consistently by the cbs .
hollenbeck was what most astute students of cbs' s strange ... ... and questionable new methods considered ... ... " typical of its newscasters " .
by jack o' brian .
oh , yeah .
i like it like that .
one of the best programs i ever heard was called " cbs views the press " .
a great many people liked it , some didn' t ... ... but no one ever called it anything but honest .
it was the work of an honest reporter .
don hollenbeck .
he also worked occasionally on " see it now " .
he did the 11 p . m .
news over some of these stations .
he had been sick lately and he died this morning .
the police said it was suicide ... gas .
not much of an obit .
but , at least we got our facts straight , and it was brief .
and that' s all don hollenbeck would have asked .
good night , and good luck .
got to be in philadelphia this morning .
what time is your train ?
8 : 00 .
charlie going with you ?
uh huh .
here' s a thought .
what if we' re wrong ?
we' re not wrong .
we' re not going to look back ... ... and say we protected the wrong side ?
protected them from what ?
in the name of what ?
what would we be preserving ?
argument could be made , " for the greater good " .
not once you give it all away .
it' s no good then .
it' s just a thought .
senator , may we not drop this ?
we know he belonged to the lawyer' s guild .
and mr. cohn nods his head at me .
i did you , i think , no personal injury , mr. cohn .
no , sir .
i meant to do you no personal injury .
no .
and if i did , i beg your pardon .
let us not assassinate this lad further , senator .
you' ve done enough .
let' s ... let' s ...
have you no sense of decency , sir ?
at long last , have you left no sense of decency ?
i know this hurts you , mr. welch .
senator , i think it hurts you , too .
i' d like to finish this .
have you some private reservation ... ... when you take the oath that you will tell the whole truth ... ... that lets you be the judge of what you will testify to ?
the answer is there' s no reservation about telling the whole truth .
thank you , sir .
then tell us who delivered the documents to you !
i don' t want to mean that this new fashion is not chic .
i think it' s just no good for me .
uh , not for you .
milko , anything you care to say on that subject ?
i think no comment .
it' s got to be there .
if you can' t find it , i can' t write about it .
check again .
charlie said he dropped it off .
charlie said he dropped ...
shirley , can i see you a minute ?
i got to call you back .
joe !
you , too .
close the door .
have a seat .
how are you ?
fine , thank you .
swell .
yeah .
uh , you both are aware that there' s a policy at cbs ... ... that no two employees can be married .
i want to ask you a question , but i don' t want you to answer it .
i want you to consider it .
i know you two are married .
everyone knows .
that' s not my question .
in the next few weeks i have to lay off a couple of people .
we' re making some significant cuts across the board .
i wanted you to know that ... ... because you could save someone else being fired .
i' m asking you to consider making this decision a little easier .
i don' t need an answer now .
just think about it .
good .
well , joe ...
well ?
sure we' re gonna miss you around here .
i' il pack my things .
i think it' s for the best .
we' il find out !
mrs. wershba ...
everybody knew .
natalie , did he say what it was about ?
no .
just that he wanted to talk to you in his office .
uh oh !
the problem isn' t simply that you' ve lost your sponsor .
with alcoa , " see it now " still loses money .
the fee is 50, 000 dollars .
last week' s episode we did for less than 50, 000 dollars .
fred , you' re speaking beyond your competence .
we' il certainly find another sponsor .
64, 000 dollar question " brings in over 80, 000 in sponsors ... ... and it costs one third of what you do .
ed , i' ve got tuesday night programming that' s number one .
people want to enjoy themselves .
they don' t want a civics lesson .
what do you want , bill ?
i don' t want to get a stomachache ... ... every time you take on a controversial subject .
i' m afraid that' s the price you have to be willing to pay .
let' s walk very carefully through these next few moments .
the content of what we' re doing is more important ... ... than what some guy in cincinnati ...
it' s what you' re doing , ed .
not me .
not frank stanton .
you .
cbs news " , " see it now " all belong to you , bill .
you wouldn' t know it .
what is it you want ?
credit ?
i never censored a single program .
i hold on to affiliates who wanted entertainment from us .
i fight to keep the license ... ... with the very same politicians that you are bringing down ... ... and i never , never said no to you .
never .
i would argue that we have done very well by one another .
i would argue that this network ... ... is defined by what the news department has accomplished .
and i would also argue that never saying no is not the same as not censoring .
really ?
you should teach journalism .
you and mr. friendly .
... why didn' t you correct mccarthy ... ... when he said that alger hiss was convicted of treason ?
he was only convicted of perjury .
you corrected everything else .
did you not want the appearance of defending a known communist ?
i would argue that everyone censors , including you .
what do you want to do , bill ?
i' m taking your program from a half an hour to an hour .
and it won' t be a weekly program and it won' t be tuesday nights .
when would it be ?
sunday afternoons .
how many episodes ?
5 .
why don' t you just fire me , bill ?
i don' t think it' s what either of us wants .
you owe me 5 shows .
you won' t like the subject matter .
probably not .
fred , i' il need you for a moment .
thank you , mary .
goodbye , mr. friendly .
he wants me to lay a few people off .
i' m sure he does .
let' s do our first show about the downfall of television .
senate' s gonna vote to censure mccarthy tomorrow .
probably .
and then what happens ?
he sits in the back row .
right .
they keep him in the senate .
they don' t kick him out .
no , he stays .
well , we might as well go down swinging .
did you know the most trusted man in america is milton berle ?
see , you should have worn a dress !
how does a scotch sound ?
scotch sounds good .
did you know joe and shirley were married ?
sure .
did everyone know ?
pretty much .
we are proud because from the beginning of this nation ... ... man can walk upright .
no matter who he is or who she is .
he can walk upright and meet his friend or his enemy .
and he does not fear that because that enemy ... ... may be in a position of great power ... ... that he can be suddenly thrown in jail ... ... to rot there without charges and with no recourse to justice .
we have the habeas corpus act and we respect it .
i began by saying that our history will be what we make it .
if we go on as we are ... ... then history will take its revenge , and retribution will not limp ... ... in catching up with us .
just once in a while , let us exalt the importance of ideas and information .
let us dream to the extent of saying that on a given sunday night ... ... the time normally occupied by ed sullivan ... ... is given over to a clinical survey on the state of american education .
and a week or two later , the time normally used by steve allen ... ... is devoted to a thorough going study of american policy in the middle east .
would the corporate image of their respective sponsors be damaged ?
would the shareholders rise up in their wrath and complain ?
would anything happen ... ... other than a few million people would have received a little illumination ... ... on subjects that may well determine the future of this country ... ... and therefore the future of the corporations ?
there is , in one reporter' s opinion ... ... considerable evidence against that contention .
but even if they are right , what have they got to lose ?
because if they are right ... ... and this instrument is good for nothing ... ... but to entertain , amuse and insulate ... ... then the tube is flickering now ... ... and we will soon see that the whole struggle is lost .
this instrument can teach .
it can illuminate and it can even inspire .
but it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it ... ... towards those ends .
otherwise , it is merely wires and lights ... ... in a box .
good night , and good luck .
