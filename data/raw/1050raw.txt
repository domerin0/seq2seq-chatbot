hey , curt , you guys gonna have a little bash your last night in town ?
moose has been lookin ' for you all day .
he got worried .
thought you were tryin ' to avoid him .
what do you got ?
oh , great .
that' s $2, 000 , man . $2, 000 !
mr. jennings gave it to me to give to you .
he' s sorry it' s late .
it' s the first scholarship the moose lodge has given out .
he says they' re all very proud of you back at the lodge .
why don' t you hold it for me ?
i don' t want it .
take it .
it' s yours .
i' il take it .
listen , your sister calls .
i' il talk to you later .
wait a second .
she can wait .
make it short and sweet , huh ?
listen , i don' t think i' m gonna be going tomorrow .
come on .
what are you talking about ?
i was thinkin ' i could wait a year , go to city for a while .
you chicken fink .
after all we went through to get accepted ?
we' re gettin ' out of this turkey town ... and now you wanna crawl back into your cell ?
you wanna end up like john ?
you just can' t stay 17 forever .
get that through your head !
i just need some time .
i gotta go talk to laurie .
now take it .
take it !
we' re leaving in the morning , all right ?
we' re leaving in the morning !
we gonna rock and roll ourselves to death , baby !
you got the wolfman jack show !
don' t with the thing !
will you stop it with the big bopper stuff ?
hi , john !
not too good , huh ?
why is it every girl around here is ugly or has a boyfriend ?
where is the dazzling beauty i' ve been searching for all my life ?
i know what you mean .
the pickings are really gettin ' slim .
the whole strip is shrinkin ' .
you know , i remember about five years ago ... it would take a couple of hours and a tank full of gas ... just to make one circuit .
it was really somethin ' .
hey , john .
someone new in town .
are you gonna go after him ?
hey , listen , professor .
if he can' t find me , then he ain' t even worth racin ' , right ?
big shot .
well ?
where was i ?
how you thought high school romances were goofy ... and we started dating only because you thought i was cute and funny ... but then you suddenly realized ... you were in love with me , it was serious ...
you were leadin ' up to somethin ' kinda big .
you make it sound like i' m giving dictation .
well , seriously ... what i meant was that ... since we do care for each other so much ... and since we should really consider ourselves as adults now ...
could i have a couple of those fries ?
where was i ?
consider ourselves adults .
right , right .
i thought , maybe before i leave ... we could agree that ...
seeing other people while i' m away can' t possibly hurt , you know ?
you mean dating other people ?
it would strengthen our relationship .
then we' d know for sure that we' re really in love .
not that there' s any doubt .
i think you' re right .
i mean , we' re not kids anymore ... and it' s silly to think that when we' re 3, 000 miles apart ... we shouldn' t be able to see other people and go out .
laurie , listen .
i didn' t ask for that back .
i know .
i just sort of think it' s juvenile now .
i' il keep it at home .
it' s less conspicuous there .
you don' t wanna wear it ?
i didn' t say that .
i understand , and i' m not upset .
i can' t expect you to be a monk while you' re away .
i got a really neat record collection .
i even got " pledging my love " by johnny ace .
how can you love nelson when he' s going out with marilyn gator ?
since he dumped on you ...
he didn' t dump on me , you little dip !
oh , hi , steve .
hey , sis .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
what is it ?
nothing !
i' ve decided to let you take care of my car while i' m away .
at least until christmas .
i' m comin ' back for a couple of weeks at christmas .
i' ve got some very simple instructions for you .
here' s the keys .
first of all , only 30 weight castrol r.
i' ve written the tire pressure and stuff on a pad in the glove ...
are you listening ?
hey , what' s wrong ?
are you crying ?
i can' t believe it !
i don' t know what to say !
i' il love and protect this car until death do us part .
this is a super fine machine .
this might even be better than darryl starbird' s superfleck moon ...
it is !
it' s better than darryl starbird' s superfleck moonbird .
budda ?
how' d you like to go to the drive in movies with me ?
you gotta be kidding .
would i kid about a thing like that ?
i have a new car .
did she do that to you ?
curt , you wanna bomb around ?
i wanna try out my new wheels .

i also ...
i forgot the car .
did you get it ?
you got it !
you didn' t get it .
why didn' t you get it ?
i needed some things and i thought as long as i was in there ...
look , debbie , can you loan me a dollar ?
are you for real ?
come on .
girls don' t pay .
guys pay .
see , i' ve only got a 50 , and he doesn' t have change .
i can' t believe this .
i really cannot believe this .
here .
excuse me .
could you ...
buy you a bottle of booze ?
yeah , i know .
you lost your i. d. what kind do you want ?
gee , that' s terrific .
just some old harper ?
that one over there ... that' s freddy benson' s ' vette .
he had a head on collision with a drunk .
boom !
didn' t have a chance .
he was a good driver too .
it' s pretty grim when a guy gets it and it' s not even his own fault .
needs a paint job , that' s for sure .
see that over there ?
that ' 41 ?
that used to be ... believe it or not ... the fastest car in the valley .
i never got a chance to race earl , though .
he got his 1955 in about the hairiest crash we ever had here .
