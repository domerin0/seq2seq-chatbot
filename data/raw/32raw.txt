our world is gone now ... ... smashed by the wars .
now i am the keeper of his body ... ... embalmed here , in the egyptian ways ...
i followed him as pharaoh , and have now ruled 40 years .
hello , papa .
i am the victor ... ... but what does it all mean , when there is no one left to remember ... ... the great cavalry charge at gaugamela ?
or the mountains of the hindu kush ... ... when we crossed a 100, 000 man army into india ... ?
he was a god , cadmos ... ... or as close as anything i' ve ever seen .
tyrant , they yell so easily .
i laugh .
no tyrant ever gave back so much .
what do they know of the world , these schoolboys ?
it takes strong men to rule .
alexander was more , he was prometheus , a friend to man .
he changed the world .
before him , there were tribes , and after him ... all was possible .
there was suddenly a sense the world could be ruled by one king ... ... and be better for all .
18 great alexandrias he built .
it was an empire , not of land and gold , but of the mind .
it was a hellenic civilization ... ... open ... to all .
but how can i say it ?
how can i tell you what it was like ... ... to be young , and to dream big dreams ?
to believe when alexander looked you in the eye , you could do anything .
anything .
in his presence , by the light of apollo ... we were better than ourselves !
truly .. ... i' ve known many great men in my life , but only one colossus .
and only now , when old ... ... do i understand who this force of nature really was .
or do i ?
did such a man as alexander exist ?
of course not !
we idealized him , make him better than he was .
men ... all men , reach and fall ... ... reach and fall .
in the east ... ... the vast persian empire ruled almost all the known world .
in the west , the once great greek city states ... ... thebes , athens , sparta , had fallen from pride .
for a hundred years now , the persian kings had bribed the greeks ... ... with their gold to fight as mercenaries .
it was philip , the one eyed , who changed all this .
uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders from the high and lowlands ... ... with his blood and guts , he built a professional army ... ... and brought the devious greeks to their knees .
he then turned his eye on persia ... ... where it was said the new " great king " darius , himself ... ... on his throne in babylon , feared philip .
it was from these loins of war that alexander was born , in pella .
dreams are yours for keeping pella , macedonia
some called his mother , queen olympias , a sorceress ... ... and said that alexander was the child of dionysus ... ... others zeus .
but , truly , there was not a man in macedonia ... ... who didn' t look at father and son , side by side ... ... and wonder .
fortune follows bold ones
trust the ones who give you love
life has just begun , son
her skin is water
her tongue is fire .
she is your friend .
take it .
if you hesitate , she will strike .
remember that , hmm ?
never hesitate .
yes .
they are like people .
you can love them for years ... ... feed them , nurture them , ... but still ... they can turn on you .
don' t hurt her .
good .
come .
he calls me a barbarian .
philip makes a mockery of dionysus every night !
women are the only ones ... ... who know dionysus .
my little achilles .
stay , alexander , down !
down .
mama !
down .
what is it you want ?
six months , did you miss me ?
not here !
proud bitch !
i' m still your king !
king of what ?
sheepherders ? !
i am of achilles ' royal blood .
the blood of herakles runs in my veins !
you are nothing but a drunken whore !
shut your foul mouth , you ten titted bitch from hades !
which god could i curse to have ever laid eyes on you !
do you think people respect you ?
you think they don' t know your bastards ?
damn your sorceress soul .
you keep him here like one of your snakes !
i told you not !
i told you not !
you' il obey me .
i will not .
you' il obey me , or i' il kill you with my own hands !
no !
no , stop !
papa !
obey me !
your majesty !
no !
in the name of the gods .
he will never be yours !
never !
in my womb , i carried my avenger !
in the world he grew up to ... ... i' ve come to believe it was in friendship that alexander found his sanity .
you don' t need much to fight
when you' re in the front ranks of a battle ... ... facing some northern barbarian tribe ... ... courage won' t be in the lining of your stomach , nearchus .
it' s in the heart of a man !
you don' t need to eat everyday ... ... or until you' re full , ptolemy !
you don' t need to lie in bed in a morning ... ... when you can have some good bean soup , cassander , after a forced night march !
come on , alexander .
come on !
who will ever respect you as a king ?
do you think it' s because of your father ?
the first rule of war is to do what you ask your men to do ... ... no more , no less !
good !
that' s it !
well done , hephaistion !
good wrestling !
that' s what i want !
come , come , come .
you did well , but you lost .
now , both of you , congratulate the other .
go on !
would you want me to let you win , alexander ?
you' re right
but i promise you i will beat you one day , hephaistion .
it was said later that alexander was never defeated ... ... except by hephaistion' s thighs .
although an inferior race ... the persians control at least four fifths of the known world .
but is it possible ... that the source of egypt' s mighty river nile ... ... could rise in these distant mountains of the outer earth ?
if so , an experienced navigator could find his way here ... ... by this river east , down into the great plains of india ... ... out into the eastern ocean at end of the world ... ... and by this route , up the nile ... ... back to egypt , into the middle sea , and home ... ... to greece .
now if only these frogs could look outward ... ... and act on their favored position at the center , greece could rule the world !
why is it , master ... ... in myth these lands you speak of are known ?
india , where herakles and dionysus traveled ... ... all these men who went east , theseus ... ... jason , achilles , were victorious .
from generation to generation their stories have been passed on .
why ?
unless there was truth to them .
tales of amazons ?
no , alexander .
only common people believe these tales , as they believe most anything .
we are here precisely to educate ourselves against such foolish passions .
but if we are superior to the persians , as you say , why do we not rule them ?
it is ...
it has always been our greek dream to go east .
the east has a way of swallowing men and their dreams .
master ?
master ?
yes ?
out with it !
why are the persians so cruel ?
that is not the subject for today , nearchus .
but , it is true that the oriental races are known for their barbarity ... ... and their slavish devotion to their senses .
excess in all things is the undoing of men .
that is why we greeks are superior .
we practice control of our senses .
moderation , we hope !
then what of achilles at troy , master ?
was he not excessive ?
achilles simply lacks restraint .
he dominates other men so completely that even when he withdraws from battle ... ... crazed with grief over his dead lover , patroclus ... ... he seriously endangers his own army .
he is a deeply selfish man !
would you say that the love between achilles and patroclus is a corrupting one ?
when men lie together in lust , it is a surrender to the passions ... ... and does nothing for the excellence in us .
nor does any other excess , cassander ... ... jealousy among them .
but when men lie together and knowledge and virtue are passed between them ... ... that is pure and excellent .
when they compete to bring out the good , the best in each other ... ... this is the love between men that can build a city state ... ... and lift us from our frog pond .
philip brought such as aristotle from athens to educate our rough people .
and growing more ambitious , he now planned the invasion of persia .
is that the best you can do , cleitus ?
back to the phalanx with you , i' il ride him myself !
no one will ride that beast , your majesty !
not with your leg
he' s been beaten far too often .
my noble king , he' s a high spirited animal , yes .
high spirited and worthy of , of philip of macedon !
for three and a half talents ... ... i couldn' t possibly make a , make a profit on him , but for you
why would i want such a beast ?
i already have a wife !
do i seem so old ?
hold him !
a broken neck comes free , you fool !
he' s too nervous for battle .
sell him for meat .
buy him for me , father !
i' il ride him .
and if you don' t ?
i' il pay for him myself !
with what , your singing voice ?
i' il pay you !
i tell you the horse can' t be ridden , lad .
his mind is broken .
he can be ridden ... ... by me !
if you can rule that horse , i' il make him yours ... ... at half the price .
that horse' il kill him , philip .
he' il break the boy in two !
will he ?
perhaps she' il make a musician out of him !
the boy doesn' t have the craft .
he could hurt himself .
he' il have to figure that out for himself .
it' s time .
you don' t like your shadow , do you ?
it' s like a dark spirit coming up to get you .
do you see ?
that' s us
it' s just a trick of apollo' s .
he' s the god of ... ... the sun .
but i' il show you how to outwit him ... ... you and me together .
bucephalus .
that' s what i' il call you ... ... strong and stubborn
bucephalus and alexander .
come now , let' s ride together .
ah , he' s got some titan in him yet !
attalus !
cleitus !
for zeus' s sake , he beat you , man !
now , bucephalus .
show them .
my son !
my son !
you remember achilles .
he' s my favorite !
why ?
because he loved patroclus , and avenged his death !
and his fate ?
that he must die young , but with great glory .
did he have a choice ?
yes !
he could live a long life , but there would be no glory .
you dream of glory , alexander .
your mother encourages you .
but there' s no glory without suffering and this she will not allow .
one day i' il be on walls like these .
prometheus stole the secret of fire and gave it to man .
it made zeus so angry , he chained prometheus to a rock in the great caucasus ... ... and each day his eagle pecked out the poor man' s liver .
each night it grew back again ... ... so that it could be eaten the next day .
miserable fate .
why ?
who knows these things ?
anyway ...
oedipus tore out his eyes ... when he found out he' d murdered his father ... ... and married his mother .
knowledge that came too late .
medea , she slaughtered her two children in vengeance ... ... when jason left her for a younger wife .
my mother would never hurt me .
it' s never easy to escape our mothers , alexander .
all your life , beware of women .
they' re far more dangerous than men .
herakles !
even after he accomplished his twelve labors ... ... he was punished with madness , slaughtered his three children .
poor herakles
great herakles !
all greatness comes from loss .
even you , the gods will one day judge harshly .
when i' m king like you one day , father ?
don' t rush the day , boy .
you risk all .
my father threw me into battle before i knew how to fight .
now you know !
i hated him then , but i understand why now .
a king isn' t born , alexander , he' s made ... ... by steel and by suffering .
a king must know how to hurt those he loves .
it' s lonely .
ask herakles .
ask any of them !
fate is cruel .
no man or woman can be too powerful or too beautiful without disaster befalling .
they laugh when you rise too high ... ... and crush everything you' ve built with a whim .
what glory they give , in the end , they take away .
they , they make of us slaves .
pregnant so soon ... ... the little whore .
he will marry her in the spring , during dionysus ' festival ... ... and when her first son is born ... ... her sweet uncle , attalus , will convince philip ... ... to name the boy his successor , with himself as regent
and you ... ... you will be sent on some impossible mission ... ... against some monstrous northern tribe , ... to be mutilated in one more meaningless battle over cattle .
and i , no longer queen , will be put to death ... ... with your sister and the remaining members of our family .
i wish ... ... sometimes you could see the light , mother .
truth is , he' s taken nothing from you that you' ve not been long without .
the only way is to strike .
announce your marriage to a macedonian now !
beget a child of pure blood , he would be one of them , not mine ... ... and he would have no choice but to make you king !
there is still kynnane .
eurydice was perfect . lf your father , that pig , had not ravaged her first !
say nothing more of my father !
do you hear me ?
say nothing .
you' re right
forgive me .
a mother loves too much .
who shall i sing to sleep at night anymore ?
i wish we could spend more time together .
like we used to , when you were the sweetest boy .
there' s never been time , mother .
since i was a child , i' ve been groomed to be ever the best .
my poor child , you' re like achilles ... ... cursed by your greatness .
take my strength .
you must never confuse your feelings with your duties , alexander .
a king must make public gestures for the common people .
i know . ... but you will be nineteen this summer ... and the girls already say you don' t like them , you like hephaistion more .
i understand .
it' s natural for a young man
but if you go to asia without leaving your successor , you risk all .
hephaistion loves me ... as i am ... ... not who .
loves ?
loves ?
in the name of dionysus ... ... understand how philip thinks ... ... for your own sake .
your life hangs in the balance !
his spies are inside your closest circle .
stop !
i' m his only worthy son !
you crazed woman .
he' d never hurt me .
even if eurydice had a boy , he' d be twenty before he' d let him rule !
yes , and you would be 40 !
old and wise ... ... like parmenion ... ... and philip' s young son would be 20 !
like you now ... ... but raised by him , his blood .
he will never give you the throne now , alexander .
never
come , alexander , drink this sadness away !
if only thirst could quench sorrow , ptolemy .
there' s only one thing better than winning a battle , son ... ... and that' s the taste of a new woman !
you' il find it far sweeter ... than self pity .
pausanias , you bore me .
be gone with you !
i found you the right girl !
what' s your name , darling ?
what' s your name ?
antigone !
i love you , my little imp !
and i love you , cleitus .
please !
no !
there you go .
would you prefer a seat , cleitus ?
i' il sleep in my grave , hephaistion .
while alive , i prefer dancing .
who' s your new friend ?
there' s your new friend .
no , please , don' t !
a toast ,
a toast !
i drink to our greek friends ... ... and to our new union , ... macedonia and greece ... ... equals in greatness !
and to philip , our king ... without whom this union could not be possible .
come , attalus , leave some damn air in the hall !
and last , i drink to ... the king' s marriage to my niece , eurydice ... ... a macedonian queen we can be proud of !
to philip and eurydice ... ... and to their legitimate sons !
alexander , don' t !
what am i , you son of a dog ?
come then !
shut up !
shut up , all of you !
this is my wedding !
not some public brawl !
apologize , by zeus , before you dishonor me !
you defend the man who called my mother a whore and me a bastard
and i dishonor you ?
you listen like your mother !
attalus is my family now , the same as you !
choose your relatives more carefully !
don' t expect me to sit here and watch you shame yourself .
you insult me !
i insult you ?
a man not fit to lick the ground my mother walks on ?
you dog , questioning your queen !
shame ?
i' ve nothing to be ashamed of , you arrogant brat !
i' il marry the girl if i want !
and i' il have as many sons as i want !
and there' s nothing you or your harpy mother can do about it !
why must you think everything i do and say comes from my mother ?
because i know her heart , by hera ... ... and i see her in your eyes !
you covet this throne too much !
now we all know that she wolf of a mother of yours wants me dead !
well , you can both dream , boy !
this is the wine talking .
leave the boy , it will wait till morning .
now !
i command you ... apologize to your kinsman !
apologize !
no kinsman to me .
good night , old man .
and when my mother remarries , i' il invite you to her wedding .
you bastard !
you' il obey me !
come here !
and this is the man who is going to take you from greece to persia ?
he can' t even make it from one couch to the next .
get out of my palace !
you' re exiled , you bastard !
banished from the land !
you' re not welcome here !
you' re no son of mine !
everything suddenly changed for him .
his father , king philip , was murdered ... ... and alexander , at 20 ... ... became the new ruler of macedonia .
and breaking their treaties with us , dismissing alexander as an untried boy ... ... several greek city states rose up in revolt ... ... much to persia' s delight ... ... and perhaps sponsored by their gold .
truly , alexander could love like no other ... ... but to betray him was to rouse a vast and frightening anger ... ... and he massacred several thousand of the men of that tragic city , thebes , and sold the survivors into slavery .
this , as intended , stunned and defeated the greeks .
and though , in the end , he treated most populations with magnanimity , ... it is these exceptions thebes , gaza in syria ... ... and later persepolis in persia , and others ... ... that are always remembered by those who hate alexander and all he stood for .
at 21 , alexander invaded asia ... ... with an army of 40, 000 trained men and liberating one city state after the other ... ... he conquered all of western asia , south to egypt ... ... where he was declared pharaoh of egypt ... ... worshiped as a god .
it was in egypt ... ... that the respected oracle at siwah ... ... declared him the ... ... true son of zeus .
he finally provoked darius himself to battle ... ... in the heart of the persian empire , near babylon .
40, 000 of us against 250, 000 barbarians .
it was the day alexander had waited for all his life .
alexander , son of a god .
it was a myth , of course .
at least it started as a myth .
i know .
i was there .
i saw his eyes ...
there !
in the crack of the persian line , we' il go for the head .
kill darius ?
the gods have brought him to us at last !
if i die , it' s one macedonian .
but the persians , they cannot move without darius' s command !
here .
right here , we cut the throat of the persian army !
this is madness !
you' il never get within a hundred paces of him .
have you seen the sheer size of his force ?
not if you hold them on the left , my brave parmenion ... ... with your son philotas , for just one , two hours tomorrow .
and you , unbreakable antigonous .
the center phalanx .
perdiccas .
leonnatus .
nearchus .
polyperchon .
if you pin them on the walls of your sarissas here , in the center ... ... their cavalry will follow me out to the right .
and when bold cassander breaks , stretching their left ... ... a hole will open .
then i and my cavalry , our revered ...
cleitus , ptolemy , and hephaistion ... ... we' il strike through that gap ... ... and deal the death blow to darius' s head .
even with luck , timing , the gods , we must rout them tomorrow .
destroy their army completely .
or we' il be picked apart by bandit tribes on the long journey home .
right .
you speak of home
and retreat .
but do you understand , parmenion ... ... babylon' s my new home .
alexander ... ... if we must fight , do so with stealth .
use your numbers well .
we should attack tonight when they least expect us .
i didn' t cross asia to steal this victory , cassander .
no , you are too honorable for that .
no doubt influenced from sleeping with " tales of troy " under your pillow .
but your father was no lover of homer' s .
the lands west of the euphrates ?
the hand of his daughter in marriage ?
when has a greek ever been given such honors ?
these are not honors , parmenion .
they' re bribes which the greeks have accepted .
too long !
do you forget that the man who murdered my father lies across the valley floor ?
we' re still not really sure if it was persian gold behind the assassination
that is no matter !
parmenion , you know that' s not true !
your father taught you never to surrender your reason to your passion .
regroup , fall back to the coast , raise a larger force !
i would ... ... if i were parmenion , but i am alexander .
and no more than earth has two suns , will asia bear two kings .
these are my terms ... ... and if darius isn' t a coward who hides behind his men ... ... then he' il come to me tomorrow .
and when he bows down to greece ... ... alexander' il be merciful .
by ares ' chains , he' s got balls , men !
i mean , give the man his due , parmenion !
and lads , feast tonight ... ... for tomorrow we will dine in hades .
to whom do you pray ?
phobos .
fear ?
a bad omen .
more so for darius .
i' ve come to believe that fear of death drives all men , hephaistion .
this we didn' t learn as schoolboys .
it is the cause of all our misfortunes .
so , mighty crateros ...
your majesty !
are you ready for tomorrow' s dawn ?
it' s been too long coming , if you ask me .
the men are skittish as colts .
good !
fear makes men fight better .
post your sentries alertly , but rest them well .
don' t you worry , general , i' m known to sleep with my eyes open as a baby' s arse .
only because someone might steal his loot , sire .
after tomorrow , even the thrifty among you shall be kings .
the gods are with us , your majesty .
they are .
we' il stain the ground with persian blood , my king .
i' ve always believed , alexander ... .. but , this seems so much bigger than us .
did patroclus doubt achilles when they stood side by side at the siege of troy ?
patroclus died first . ... if you were to fall , even if macedonia were to lose a king ... ... i will avenge you ... ... and follow you down to the house of death .
i would do the same .
on the eve of battle , it' s hardest to be alone .
then perhaps ... ... perhaps this is farewell ... ... my alexander .
fear not , hephaistion .
we are at the beginning .
blood makes the world rise .
blood makes the rain fall .
blood makes the earth grow .
and in blood ... ... all men are born ... ... and die .
blood is the food of the gods below .
come , bucephalus .
today we ride to our destiny .
cavalry , group !
regroup !
phalanx , turn right !
phalanx !
attention !
neoptolemus !
i remember you the day you jumped the siege tower at tyre , you were a giant !
and today ?
how will you fight ?
dexippos , by athena ... ... how far was it you threw your man wrestling at the last olympic games ?
will you match it with your spear ?
and timander ... ... son of menander , a great soldier to my father .
i still mourn your brother , addaios , who died so bravely at halicarnassus .
what an honored family you descend from , timander .
you fight for them today !
you' ve all honored your country ... ... and your ancestors .
and now we come to this most distant place in asia ... ... where across from us ... ... darius has at last ... ... gathered a vast army
yes , these persians do seem to be so many !
who is this great king who pays assassins in gold coins ... ... to murder my father , our king ... ... in a most despicable and cowardly manner ?
who is this great king , darius , who enslaves his own men to fight ?
who is this king ... ... but a king of air ?
these men do not fight for their homes .
they fight because this king tells them they must .
and when they fight , they will melt away like the air ... ... because they know no loyalty to a king of slaves .
but we are not here today as slaves !
we are here today as macedonian free men !
some of you ... ... perhaps myself ... ... will not live to see the sun set over these mountains today .
but i say to you ... ... what every warrior has known since the beginning of time , conquer your fear ... ... and i promise you , you will conquer death !
when they ask why you fought so bravely , you will answer , " i was here this day at gaugamela ... ... for the freedom ... ... and glory ... ... of greece !
zeus be with us !
cassander !
four columns , go !
where does he go ?
i don' t know , majesty .
envelop him , bessus .
hephaistion , go !
phalanx !
forward , march !
he makes a mistake , pharnakes .
yes , great king .
be brave , men !
be brave !
steady on the left , lads !
bend if you must , but never break , and keep watching the cavalry on the left !
pick up the pace !
prepare to repel chariots !
forward ...
... march !
push them back !
stay in line !
stay in line !
hold !
hold !
cassander !
go !
forward , men !
left turn !
infantry , clear .
out , now !
circle to the left !
hold your position !
hold your position !
hold !
we must fall back to the gully , father .
no , hold .
where is he ?
we' re far too thin !
get word to alexander !
move !
yes , sir !
come , macedonians !
ride !
ride !
to alexander !
shields , break off !
the shields are here !
drive for the hole !
forward !
back and to the left !
back and to the left !
philotas !
father !
go , tell alexander yourself !
and if he won' t listen , then survive me and avenge this betrayal !
pay attention , lad !
your father still watches over you !
darius !
find your horses !
darius !
go !
go !
no !
we can reach those mountains by sunset !
go all night and catch darius at dawn !
provision the horses !
alexander !
alexander !
my father' s lost !
they' ve overrun the flank !
they' re into the baggage train !
parmenion' s crumbling !
alexander , if you chase him , you risk losing your army here !
and if we capture him , we gain an empire !
you can run to the ends of the earth , you coward ... ... but you' il never run far enough !
to parmenion !
you bleed free , my lord .
may i tend to your wounds ?
no , hermolaus , not now .
there' s far worse than me , go to them .
help them .
your majesty !
you' re very brave .
what shall i call you ?
glaukos , my king !
glaukos !
and where' s your home ? illyria .
let your body go loose .
think of home now .
be brave again , glaukos ... and you will live on in glory .
alexander .
the persian empire , the greatest the world had yet known , was destroyed
and alexander at twenty five was now king of all .
we are most alone when we are with the myths .
and thus , it came to pass , in a dream as mythical ... to all greeks as achilles defeating the trojans , at this one glorious moment in time ... ... alexander was loved by all .
but in the end , i believe ... ... babylon was a far easier mistress to enter than she was to leave .
imagine the minds that conceived this .
with architects and engineers like these , we could build cities such as we' ve only dreamed !
aristotle may have called them barbarians , but he never saw babylon .
we have enough gold here to support another three generations of macedonian armies .
and macedonia would soon corrupt , cassander .
wealth in great quantities brings the crows .
not for the men who fought , i trust ?
we' il pay them well , antigonous ... but not as mercenaries for future services .
now you sound like philip .
philip never saw babylon .
no , he didn' t , hephaistion .
i know you think me a stiff old sod , but whatever our differences ... ... know this day your father would be very proud of you !
thank you , parmenion .
i ask you to forgive me my own anger , my pride .
they , too , blind me .
yes , the grandsons of goat herders ... ... we now rule two million square miles !
but ... ... none of you fear that this great fortune ... ... may drive us all to destruction .
you overvalue us .
for as long as darius breathes , he is the legitimate king of asia ... ... and i but the king of air .
but he has no power , alexander !
he' s lost in the mountains with no army .
as long as he' s lost , philotas , he can be believed in .
only when he' s found will it be decided .
it seems you' ve already made up your mind .
we must finish what we failed to do at gaugamela .
we must hunt darius down , if it be , to the ends of earth !
that was not your father' s mission !
and i am not my father .
come on .
have you so quickly forgotten fortune favors the bold ?
by the gods !
what is this ?
no wonder darius fled when he had this to come back to .
i venture one for every night of the year .
help me , aphrodite !
how will i ever go back to lysimache after this ?
i advise you not to touch , leonnatus .
here , i' il take care of it for you .
apologies .
yes , i see .
aristotle was perhaps prescient .
do these images fool us with their beauty and degrade our souls ?
great king , alexander .
the princess of the thousand roses ... ... and eldest daughter of the formerly great king , darius ... ... stateira
noble alexander ...
... i come ... ... to beg for the lives of my sisters ... ... my mother , my grandmother .
you are not wrong , princess stateira .
he , too , is alexander .
please .
i plead for my family' s lives .
sell me as a slave , great king , but please do not
look now , in my eyes ... ... princess ... ... and tell me ... how would you like to be treated ?
as i am ... a princess .
then so be it .
you and your family shall be treated as my family .
you shall live in this palace as long as you choose .
have you any other requests for me , my noble princess ?
no .
everything i wish , i have ...
requested . ... requested .
you truly are ... a queen .
yes , she would be a perfect match for you ... ... but you do nothing .
three months you have been in babylon ... ... and leave me in pella at the mercy of your enemies ... ... of which you have many .
antipater , accustomed now to the power that you have given him ... ... i must watch him grow stronger .
i am certain that he communicates secretly with parmenion , who is dangerous , but beware , most of all , of those closest to you .
they are like snakes , and can be turned .
cassander is antipater' s son ...
even cleitus , your father' s favorite ... ... and ptolemy , your friend , yes .
but beware of men who think too much .
they blind themselves .
only hephaistion do i leave out .
but all of them you make rich ... ... while your mother and yourself you leave in generous poverty .
why won' t you ever believe me ?
it is only a dark mind like mine ... ... that can know these secrets of the heart .
for they are dark , alexander ... ... so dark ...
but in you ... ... the son of zeus , lies the light of the world .
your companions will be shadows in the underworld ... ... when you are a name living forever in history ... ... as the most glorious , shining light of youth ... ... forever young , forever inspiring .
never will there be an alexander like you .
alexander the great !
remember , bring me to babylon , as you promised .
i can only help you , for they know if they harm you ... ... they will face my wrath as queen of babylon !
it' s a high ransom she charges for nine months ' lodging in the womb .
bring her , alexander .
it' il give her such joy .
joy ?
when i' m the cracked mirror of her dreams ?
stay with me tonight , hephaistion .
i' il take my own bath .
thank you , bagoas .
the generals question your obsession with darius .
they say it was never meant for you to be king of asia .
naturally .
they want only to return to their homes , rich with gold .
but i' ve seen the future , hephaistion .
i' ve seen it now a thousand times , on a thousand faces .
these people want ... ... need , change .
aristotle was wrong about them .
how so ?
look at those we' ve conquered .
they leave their dead unburied , they smash their enemies ' skulls , and drink them as dust .
they mate in public !
what can they think , or sing , or write , when none can read ?
but as alexander' s army , they can go where they never thought possible .
they can soldier or work in the cities ... ... the alexandrias , from egypt to the outer ocean .
we could connect these lands , hephaistion , and the people .
some say these alexandrias have become extensions of alexander himself .
they draw people into the cities so as to make slaves of them .
but we freed them , hephaistion , from the persia where everyone lived as slaves !
to free the people of the world ... ... such would be beyond the glory of achilles , beyond herakles ... a feat to rival prometheus ... ... who was always a friend to man .
remember the fates of these heroes .
they suffered greatly .
oh , we all suffer .
your father , mine .
they all came to the end of their time , and in the end , when it' s over , all that matters is what you' ve done .
you once said , " the fear of death drives all men .
are there no other forces ?
is there not love in your life ... ... alexander ?
i wonder sometimes , if it' s not your mother you run from .
so many years , so many miles between you .
what is it you fear ?
who knows these things ?
when i was a child , my mother thought me divine , my father weak .
which am i , hephaistion ?
weak or divine ?
all i know is , i trust only you in this world .
i' ve missed you .
i need you .
it is you i love , hephaistion ... ... no other .
you still hold your head cocked ... ... like that .
i' ve stopped that .
no , like a deer , listening in the wind .
you strike me still , alexander .
and you have eyes like no other .
i sound as stupid as a schoolboy about it .
you' re everything i care for ... ... and by the sweet breath of aphrodite ... ... i' m so jealous of losing you to this world you want so badly .
you' il never lose me , hephaistion .
i' il be with you always .
till the end .
the campaign in the northeast of persia ... ... turned into a hard guerilla war of almost three years .
we chased darius towards bactria ... ... but missed taking him by hours .
he was dying when we found him , sire .
he asked for water , he drank and died .
the great king darius had been betrayed by his own commanders .
fully honoring his corpse ... ... alexander hunted down these commanders into unknown lands ... ... crossing even beyond the river oxus into sogdia ...
we fought them as far as the unknown steppes of scythia ... ... where only legendary heroes had once trod .
the surveyors told us we were now on the borders of where europe and asia meet .
in fact , as our new maps showed , we were totally lost .
here alexander founded his tenth alexandria ... ... and settled it with veterans , their women ... ... and any who would dare the frontier life .
unable to accept defeat in any form ... ... alexander persisted in breaking every tribe that resisted ... until the day he received the head of his last enemy in surrender .
for alexander , there could be no pretender to the throne of asia ... ... which now included all of sogdia and bactria .
it was here that alexander made one of his most mysterious decisions .
her eyes tell me she cares for you , alexander ... ... perhaps too much .
in the ways of my country ... ... those who love too much lose everything ... ... and those who love with irony ... ... last .
your father must be turning in his grave .
after all this time , a hill chief' s daughter .
this girl has spirit !
but what' s the point , alexander ?
just take her as your concubine .
because i want a son .
damn you , philotas !
then half your nobles have sisters who' d make fine macedonian mothers .
to take an asian as my queen , not a captive , is a sign of deep respect .
it will , more than anything , bring us together , unify us .
which is not to say i won' t take a macedonian one day .
as a second wife ?
you insult macedonia !
alexander ... ... this is about the honor of our kingdom .
exactly !
what can be won , alexander ?
we came here to asia to punish them for their crimes .
we' ve achieved that !
seven years from home , now we drift from one far region to another ... ... chasing nomads and bandits , when macedonia bleeds its manpower !
for what ?
to build roads in asia ?
to give these people cities ?
to found cities and expand our reach is not to drift .
what benefit to macedon ?
it' s far richer than before !
look what you give them !
with respect for your age ... ... had you fought better at gaugamela when your flank was crumbling
how dare you , nearchus !
general nearchus to you , boy .
alexander spread our flank too thin !
there was nothing my father , any of you , could have done !
philotas !
alexander , i' ve known you since you were born .
i supported you at your father' s death .
at the very least , for zeus ' sake ... ... and in respect to the council that chose you king ... ... give us a macedonian heir !
a macedonian heir !
you have been heard clearly .
and after the wedding , you' il take two brigades back to babylon ... ... where i look to you , and antipater in greece ... ... to maintain our empire and supply this expedition .
i' il winter in the north with my advance army at marakand .
i pray to apollo you soon realize how far you' ve turned from your father' s path !
damn you , parmenion , by the gods and your apollo !
war was in my father' s guts , wasn' t overripe and reason like yours !
he never lusted for war , alexander , or enjoyed it so !
he consulted his peers in council ... ... among equals , the macedonian way !
he didn' t make decisions based on his personal desires !
i' ve taken us further than my father ever dreamed !
old man , we' re in new worlds !
alexander , be reasonable !
were they ever meant to be our equals ?
share our rewards ?
you remember what aristotle said .
an asian ?
what would a wedding vow ever mean to a race that has never kept their word to a greek ?
aristotle be damned !
by zeus and all the gods , what makes you so much better than them , cassander ?
better than you really are ?
in you and those like you is this .
what disturbs me most is not your lack of respect for my judgment ... ... but your contempt for a world far older than ours .
and so ten years after his mother' s insistence he marry a macedonian ...
through our union , greek and barbarian may be reconciled in peace . ... the most powerful man in the world , took a girl of no political significance .
why ?
some say it was for alliance with the tribes ... ... others the desire for a successor .
and yet others said alexander truly fell in love .
who roxane really was ... ...
i doubt that any of us ever saw further than the pools of those black eyes .
alexander ... ... special for you .
on this glorious occasion ... ...
i toast this great army that has given so much !
and in honor of them , those of you who set out with us seven long years ago ... ...
i pronounce all your debts paid forthwith from the royal treasury !
and in honor of my bride ... ... my beautiful bride ... ... we recognize the many women who' ve shared the long , hard road with us ... ... and grant them dowries befitting a proper marriage !
and what about our boys ?
and lastly ... ... lastly , the gods demand no less of us ... ... that your children with these women be given ... ... a proper greek education and military training , under our protection ... ... so as to be the new soldiers ... ... of our kingdom ... ... in asia !
i found it in egypt .
the man who sold it to me said it came from a time ... ... when man worshipped sun and stars .
i' il always think of you ... ... as the sun , alexander .
and i pray your dream will shine on all men .
i wish you a son .
you' re a great man .
many will love you , alexander , but none so pure and deep
you love him ?
he is hephaistion .
there are many different ways to love , roxane .
come .
you have no fear .
it' s fitting .
a man searches for a woman at earth' s top ... ... and finds her .
the myth becomes real .
yeah ... ... great man !
you , i kill now .
do it !
end it !
i would do
i would do the same .
i' il die a fool , for this ... ... love .
my life is now yours .
you will have my son .
who is this woman you call your queen , alexander ?
a hill girl ?
you ?
with your breeding ?
already she makes enemies with her strong , clumsy nature .
do not confuse us .
i was never a barbarian , as philip said .
we are of achilles ' royal blood !
zeus is your father !
i understand , she brings you some happiness ... ... but hear me when i tell you , act and act soon !
after seven years , people wonder , " who is this king alexander ?
i have given you ample proof .
antipater daily undermines your authority .
return to babylon and strengthen your center ... ... or come home to macedonia and reorganize ,
but do not chase your dream further east .
your life and mine depend on it .
remember ... ... my only thoughts are of you .
as you , too , must face your glorious destiny ... ... think kindly of your mother .
provide for me .
protect me from your enemies when you are gone ... ... and remember , always , ... it is i who love you more than any .
if only you were not a pale reflection of my mother' s heart .
who did this ?
tell me !
hermolaus !
never will you find a man as devoted as i.
the conspiracy deeply upset alexander ... ... not only because it involved the young pages who' d shared his dream ... ... more intimately ... ... it implicated philotas , his companion from boyhood ... ... who was captain of alexander' s royal guards .
remember me for who i am .
i do remember you , philotas , but not as you remember yourself .
it appears to me and your peers here that the true weather of your soul is ambition .
none of us defended philotas ...
i didn' t do this !
but then again , none of us ever liked him ... ... and of course , his power was carved up by the rest of us .
before he died , we tortured him to find out what his father , parmenion , knew ... ... but this we never learned .
what to do with parmenion and his 20, 000 troops guarding our supply lines ... ... was a far more delicate matter .
was he innocent in this ... ... or had he decided to act before age further withered his power ?
they' il be divided .
the men' il follow their king .
alexander won' t be there .
necessity required alexander to act ...
he sealed the camp within the hour of the first accusations against philotas .
then go , antigonous , and cleitus .
and go quickly .
three days hard riding sent antigonous and cleitus to parmenion .
his soldiers accepted the finding of guilt against parmenion ... ... as they understood the head of family was responsible ... ... for the behavior of all .
cleitus !
antigonous !
parmenion .
i remember a remark of bagoas ' once , that love eluded alexander ... ... as much , if not more , than finding the end of the world .
in the spring ... ...
alexander marched an army of a hundred and fifty thousand ... ... across the passes of the hindu kush ... ... into the unknown .
in his dream , it was the promised route to the end of the world .
