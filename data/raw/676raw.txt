where do you want this thing ? just through there , thank you .
come on , you guys .
i' ve got a surprise for you !

yup , just over there .
h here' s a place .

yeah , okay .

that' s right .
easy .

sweetie , come away from it , please .
w what is it , daddy ?
wait , wait , wait .
wow .
wow .
oh , my .
thank you , sir .
enjoy your ndr .
northam robotics household model ndr 114 , serial number 583625 .
hello .
hello .
are you one' s family ?
well , um , i guess so .
it' s scary .
it' s not scary .
it' s stupid .
i doubt that .
jenny harrison' s family' s got one ,
i doubt that .
jenny harrison' s family' s got one ,
so does kate mcallister they' re all the same .
what is it ?
it' s an android .
what' s an " andrew " ?
will that be one' s name ?
well , why not ?
it sounds good .
hello , andrew .
hello , sir .
would you care to hear the three laws of robotics ?
it' s said to be a most entertaining presentation .
okay .
sure .
will you step back , sir , to maximize presentation ?
right .
a robot may not injure a human being , or , through inaction , cause a human being to come to harm .
a robot must obey all human orders , except where those orders come in conflict with the first law .
a robot must protect itself , so long as doing so does not conflict with the first two laws .
andrew , don' t ever do that again .
of course not , sir .
it is a one time only .
you may have one with or without personality .
would you care to see a demo of the personality chip ?
uh , no , no , thank you .
we' il stick with what we' ve got .
a wise choice , sir , if one may say so .
well , you' il be staying down here .
got everything you need ?
one only requires access to a power outlet .
good .
right .
well , um , good night , andrew .
it certainly is , sir .
no .
no , andrew ,
the correct response to " good night " is " good night .
good night .
yes .
you just said " yes .
yes ?
but the correct response to " good night " is " good night .
good night , andrew .
good night , sir .
good night , andrew .
good night , sir .
you only need to say it once .
or one would be saying it forever , sir , in an infinite verbal loop .
exactly .
thank you , sir .
good .
night .
sorry , sir .
honey , i don' t want it ... following me around the house all day .
can' t can' t you turn it off or something , please ? just give him a job .
it' il be okay .
well seat belts !
seat belts !
good morning , mr. martin .
today' s temperature will be in the high 70s .
bye , mom !
have a good day , sweethearts .
have a good day , sweethearts .
mmm .
andrew , this is very good .
thank you , sir .
don' t you think ?
i think it sucks .
sucks " ?
how ?
chickens do not have lips .
she' s being rude .
you mind your manners , young lady , please .
we' re fine , andrew .
indeed you are , sir .
the kitchen .
it' s fine too , sir .
no .
go to the kitchen now .
hello .
come on .
maybe it' s a big bluff .
just a pretty face .
check .
oh , andrew , could you come up ?
oh , andrew , could you come up ?
should i  no .
it' il be fine .
yes , miss ?
andrew , would you please open the window ?
one is glad to be of service .
a lovely breeze .
now jump .
no , out the window .
did you hear something ?
was that an earthquake ?
sorry for the inconvenience .
may one re re re enter ...
er er ?
what happened , andrew ?
for the sake of family harmony ,
one is programmed not to tell .
andrew ?
andrew !
yeah ?
amanda , grace , downstairs right away .
come in , andrew .
thank you , si i i r .
andrew' s not a person , he' s a form of property .
one is not a per r r r r r r son .
but property is also important .
so from now on , as a matter of principle , in this family andrew will be treated as if he were a person .
which means there will be no more attempts to break him .
break him ?
your sister tried to kill andrew .
you too ?
shh .
sorry .
come on .
everyone up to bed .
will you be all right , andrew ?
one is capable of self mai ai aintenance , sir .
good .
good night , andrew .
good night , andrew .
guh , guh , guh g good night .
good night , andrew .
good ... night .
miss , one has been given specific orders for your safety , and that is an unsafe area .
now , come down .
okay .
thank you .
well , i think it' s gonna be sunny tonight .
me too .
so do i.
he' s my favorite .
pretty .
would you like to hold him ?
that was my favorite .
they don' t even make him anymore .
can it be repaired , little miss ?
no , it can' t !
you' re screwed .
i hate you !
get away from me .
can we fix him ?
no .
look at him he' s in a million pieces !
i' m sorry .
there' s nothing you can do .
put the rest of them away .
wow .
andrew !
yes , little miss ?
this is the best present i ever got .
one is glad to be of service .
would you please come with me ?
does this involve a window ?
no .
you can sit here .
his name is woofy , and from now on ... he' s yours .
woofy .
uh huh .
because sometimes he barks ,
once he gets to know you .
oh .
thank you very much .
you' re welcome .
i have to go to sleep now , andrew .
yes .
yeah .
can you , kinda
of course .
good night , sweetheart .
good night , andrew .
little miss ?
sure .
thanks .
miss ?
after you .
well , thank you .
you' re welcome .
andrew , did you really make this ?
yes , sir .
a robot cannot tell a lie , andrew .
that is not entirely correct , sir .
one could lie , if one were ordered to lie , or if it were necessary to tell some untruth in order to keep a human being from harm ,
or if one' s own safety were in jeopardy sir ?
andrew .
one did indeed carve that for little miss .
and the design you' re responsible for that ?
yes , sir .
what did you copy it from ?
copy it , ma' am ?
well , i mean , you didn' t just get it out of thin air .
you got it out of some book , right , or used the computer to plot it out ?
one did nothing more than study the raw material for a time ... until one came to understand how best to carve it into a shape ... that would appeal to little miss' s love of tiny mammals .
yes , yes .
please come in .
i am so glad you called .
mansky , dennis mansky .
richard mark .
and an ndr 114 .
now , i got your message , but what exactly is it doing ?
well , what interests me is he shows a number of characteristics
like creativity , curiosity , friendship that , frankly , have taken us by surprise .
mm hmm .
andrew  yes , dennis ?
social as well .
now i' d like to show you something if i may .
now , andrew carved these .
these are original works of art , and last night andrew said ,
" i enjoy making them .
" enjoy .
yes .
should one not use that word ?
no , no .
it' s fine , andrew .
see what i mean ?
it' s unusual , surely , to hear a robot talk about enjoying something .
what i want to know is , do many of your other robots have have feelings like this ?
must be ... something in the pathways .
so , then , will you be wanting a refund or a replacement ?
no , neither .
i just wanted to get your reaction to andrew .
i wanted to know what you think .
he' s unique , wouldn' t you say ?
it is an anomaly .
no refund , no replacement
how much do you want ?
i don' t think i understand .
well , clearly you realize if word of this gets out , we' il have to recall our entire line .
we' re in people' s homes , sir , with their children .
if it is doing what you say , it can also run amok .
one is not qualified to run " mucks .
all right , sir .
if i let you have andrew , you' il what you' il disassemble him , will you ?
carefully , yes .
we would need to trace the actual course of andrew' s neural pathways , replace the positronic brain , then put it him back together and return him to you , good as new .
now , these neural pathways are presumably fragile .
isn' t it possible , in the course of these procedures , that something might go wrong ?
we would make every conceivable effort .
and , in the unlikely event that something did go wrong , you' d , of course , replace andrew .
of course .
even though he' s unique and irreplaceable .
he his you s
well , it' s a natural error it has human form , therefore you read mechanical failure as eccentricity ... and anthropomorphize it .
it is a household appliance , and yet you act like it is a man .
we' re leaving .
come on , andrew .
please , i beg you to reconsider , mr. martin .
let us examine andrew , talk to your wife .
name your price !
now , listen to me .
there is no price for individuality .
he is , for better or for worse , my robot , and you will never lay your hands on him do you understand ?
all in good time .
you see , sooner or later you' il have to bring it in for repairs .
andrew , i' ve made a decision .
yes , sir ?
you will cut back on your workload .
you can no longer ... devote yourself entirely to children and housework .
but one likes the children , sir , specifically the smaller one , little miss .
that is a contradiction , andrew , and that is exactly the sort of thing you need to learn about .
thank you for choosing northam robotics .
so we need a new regimen .
regimen , sir ?
first of all , you' il spend part of each day making something .
so as not to offend humans , we' d better find something that' s not overly artistic .
could you make other things ?
i could teach you my line of work you know , timepieces and clocks and so on .
one could not tell you , sir .
one has never attempted such things .
well , you will now .
also , you' il spend part of each evening in instruction with me .
and what is the purpose of this instruction ?
to teach you , andrew to teach you all the things that haven' t been programmed into you .
andrew , you' re unique .
unique ?
thank you for choosing northam robotics .
and i feel a responsibility to help you ... become whatever you' re able to be .
and what is one able to be ?
well , i don' t know .
see , people grow through time .
but then , of course , for you , time is a completely different proposition .
for you , time is endless .
endless ?
is this a good piece ?
very .
what about this one ?
excellent .
it was a lucky april shower
it was the most convenient door
i found a million dollar baby
in a five and ten cent store
and , nine months later , a baby is born .
and those , andrew , are the so called facts of life .
people actually do this , sir ?
well , yes .
and married people one supposes they see it as some kind of requirement or obligation .
well , it [ clears throat ]
it' s not exactly an obligation , andrew .
that' s a relief .
and it is the natural and preferable way to conceive children .
sir , of all these millions of sperm , only one makes it ?
that' s true .
what happens to the others ?
well , they die .
they die ?
one feels badly for them .
well , one does .
but it' s completely agreed that it feels good  for both parties , sir ?
in an ideal world .
so people do it rather frequently .
how often , sir ?
well , as often as they can , matter of fact .
ahh .
at least at first .
sir ,
may one speak frankly with you ?
as always , andrew .
it' s just that the whole process it sounds so messy .
i think that' s a fair comment .
they die .
isn' t it ?
what ?
it' s called " humor .
" humor " ?
yes .
people tell jokes to make each other laugh .
and this laughter gives pleasure , sir ?
yes .
sir , could you teach one to tell a joke ?
well , i let' s see .
um two drunks walk into a bar .
wouldn' t two drunks walk out of a bar , sir ?
you walk into a bar to drink , and you come out drunk .
let' s try something simpler , andrew .
um [ clears throat ]
knock knock .
" knock knock " ?
no , knock knock , someone' s at the door .
shall one get it , sir ?
no , no .
no .
y you say , " who' s there , " andrew .
who' s there , andrew ?
no , just " who' s there ?
one does not know , sir .
let' s start with something a little simpler , andrew .
why did the chicken cross the road ?
one does not know , sir .
possibly a predator was behind the chicken .
or , possibly , there was a female chicken on the other side , if it' s a male chicken .
or possibly a food source or , depending on the season , it might be migrating .
one hopes there' s no traffic .
to get to the other side .
to get to the other side .
ohhh .
why is that funny ?
so , what do you kids have planned for the day ?
probably stick with andrew .
what about you , miss ?
i' m gonna go play at my friend natalie' s house .
oh .
may one , sir ?
is now a good time ?
what ?
a good time for what ?
last night , sir taught one  no , no , no .
don don' t blame me , andrew . just go ahead .
thank you , sir .
two cannibals were eating a clown .
one turns to the other and says , " does this taste funny to you ?
how do you make a hanky dance ?
put a little boogie in it .
what is a brunette between two blondes ?
translator .
do you know why blind people don' t like to skydive ?
it scares their dogs .
a man with dementia is driving on the freeway .
his wife calls and says , " sweetheart ,
i heard there' s someone driving the wrong way on the freeway .
he says , " one ?
there' s hundreds !
what' s silent , smells like worms ?
bird farts .
it must have been an engineer who designed the human body .
who else would put a waste processing plant next to a recreation area ?
a woman goes into a doctor' s office .
the doctor says , " mind if i numb your breasts ?
" not at all .
num num num num num .
one did it , sir .
andrew , it was fine , but we might want to talk about ... appropriateness and , um and timing .
it' s 10 : 15 , sir .
oh , andrew .
little miss .
would you like me to teach you how to play a duet ?
certainly .
come on .
okay , ready ?
you start here , and then just follow me .
i play first , okay ?
all right .
ready ?
your turn .
good .
very good .
now together .
that was wonderful .
thanks .
thank you , little miss .
hi , mom .
grace , is it possible for you to find somewhere more private to do that ?
no problem . just give me your credit disc and we' il get a hotel room .
what did you say to me ?
let' s go .
what did you say to me , young lady ?
you get off that bike this minute , and you are grounded !
get go on !
get out of here , you piece of scum !
richard ?
does this look right ?
hi , mom .
didn' t you talk to her about that boy ?
mmm , well , not yet .
oh .
but i will .
kind of hoping it' s a phase that' il pass ,
like the others .
i am so sick of these damn clocks .
i' ve already given half them away .
perhaps we should sell them .
sell them ?
well , it' s an idea .
well , who gets the money ?
well , i imagine we will .
but andrew does all the work .
yes , but andrew' s our  then andrew should get the money .
andrew is a robot .
what conceivable use would a robot have for money ?
robots don' t go shopping .
robots don' t go on vacations .
robots don' t eat dinners in fancy restaurants .
i can' t believe we' re having this discussion .
dad , it doesn' t matter what he is .
andrew deserves to benefit from the work he does .
sweetheart ,
i will do what' s right for andrew .
of course i will .
but at the end of the day we are talking about a machine , and you can' t invest your emotions in a machine .
right ?
can i get you anything ?
no , thank you .
there you are .
how are ya ?
bill , good morning .
this must be andrew .
andrew , bill feingold , family lawyer .
andrew .
you own one of my clocks .
this is one of my favorites .
do you enjoy it ?
uh , yes , i do , very much .
i like the new office , bill .
what floor are we on here ?
thirty seven .
hmm .
andrew , come and have a look at this .
no , thank you , sir .
you sure ?
no .
how can i help you ?
as you know , andrew' s earned a great deal of money from his endeavors , and what he really wants to do is open his own bank account .
a bank account in the name of a robot ?
mmm .
would that be legal ?
i couldn' t say .
there are no precedents .
i don' t think there' s a law against it , but , uh
richard , why why do you want to give him a bank account ?
what' s he need money for ?
to pay for things , of course , which otherwise sir would have to pay for .
one would like to pull one' s own .
weight .
for what , sir ?
andrew .
yes , little miss ?
ooh !
oh .
oh .
oh , i' m so sorry .
oh .
not to worry .
it can be repaired .
wow .
oh left .
andrew , remember frank , my boyfriend ?
yes , the one your sister says has a nice ass .
oh .
last night
last night he asked me to marry him .
one gathers that is a good thing .
well , i haven' t said " yes " yet .
so there is doubt .
no .
frank is wonderful .
he' s handsome .
he' s reliable .
he' s somebody i could spend the rest of my life with .
i could have children with him .
then what is the problem ?
board ?
no , not at all .
not him there .
oh .
well , i have this friend ... that' s very special to me .
he' s just so sweet and funny , and whenever i' m with him ...
i don' t want to be with frank .
one can see that would create a complication .
yes .
but the answer' s staring you in the face .
marry your friend .
what ?
well , he' s not
i mean , h he
a relationship between us would be impossible , really .
it could never work out .
why ?
well , because he' s not
because he he' il never be
yes ?
is something wrong ?
no .
nothing' s wrong , nothing at all .
thank you for listening to me .
one is glad to be of service .
little miss , what will you do about frank ?
accept his proposal .
really ?
humans .
andrew , yes ?
it would mean so much to me if you would be an usher at my wedding .
one is unfamiliar with this term .
how does one " ush " ?
you help people to their seats .
you wear a tuxedo .
one would wear clothing ?
yes .
one has never been asked to wear clothing .
it would be an honor .
great .
one still is all thumbs .
installed what ?
um , an alarm .
if you try to enter andrew' s brain while you' re making this repair , the police will be alerted .
also , you should probably know that [ clears throat ]
if you actually injure andrew' s brain or positronic pathways in anyway , my lawyer , the good mr. feingold , will be happy to sue you .
he will sue you for the lost value of andrew' s income until the end of time .
well , i think we understand each other .
good .
sir , one more item of business .
as long is one is in the shop , can you do work on one' s face ?
one wishes to have more expression .
one has thoughts and feelings that presently do not show .
you want your thoughts and feelings to show on your face ?
yes , like the contempt that you are showing me right now .
well , we have done some experimentation .
we are able to give robots superficial responses ... which mimic human expression .
one has read that there have been ndr upgrades .
yes , yes .
we' ve worked up a dozen experimental models with expression capabilities , sleeker body types .
we ran some market surveys and decided not to go ahead with the line .
why not ?
negative consumer reaction .
there' s a growing fear that robots will continue to make ... the human work force obsolete .
andrew has worked for me for over 15 years .
there' s no danger of anyone losing their job to him .
surely there' s no concern performing these modifications on an old style robot .
true .
but procedures like that would be prohibitively expensive .
it is understood that you will attempt to rivet one .
screw , andrew .
really ?
how much ?
that is roughly one' s monthly salary .
it' s more than i make in a year .
hmm , not bad for
what did you call him last time we were here ?
household appliance .
household appliance ?
household appliance , yes .
may the peace of the lord be with you always .
i now pronounce you husband and wife .
you may kiss the bride now .
it is my pleasure to present mr. and mrs. frank charney .
what ?
good evening , sir .
magnificent night .
you look very sharp this evening , andrew .
thank you , sir .
it was quite challenging for the tailor .
may one continue wearing clothing ?
if it suits you .
are you serious ?
as always .
well , i suppose so .
we' il have to find you some other stuff , though .
you can' t wear tails all the time .
really ?
how sad .
sit down , andrew , please .
thank you , sir .
it was a wonderful wedding , wasn' t it ?
oh , yes , sir .
and , if one may say , you are a spectacular dancer .
well , that' s very kind .
not at all , sir .
it' s the truth .
did you record the day ?
every second , sir , is in one' s memory bank .
well , let' s watch it , shall we ?
sir ?
is everything all right ?
um [ clears throat ]
they' ve both gone now , andrew .
well , things change .
things always change .
people move on .
it' s as it should be .
but , uh , what i realized today is that , uh ,
i' il never stop missing them .
sir ?
one is still here .
and one is glad of that , andrew .
thank you .
good night , sir .
good night , andrew .
lloyd !
come here .
what did i tell you about throwing sand at people ?
what did i tell you ?
now apologize to andrew .
i will not apologize to it .
him .
it .
lloyd .
sorry .
one understands why some animals eat their young .
i' m so sorry , andrew .
are you all right ?
you seem very quiet .
how does one obtain freedom ?
y you wish to leave us ?
not at all , little miss .
one merely wishes to be declared free .
but why ?
you have so much freedom here .
until one is ordered to do something .
andrew , it' s been years since anyone' s given you an order .
but you may still request one to perform tasks .
well , we ask all the time , but it' s a request , not an order .
but that' s not enough for you , is it ?
one has studied your history .
terrible wars have been fought where millions have died ... for one idea : freedom .
and it seems that something that means so much to so many people ... would be worth having .
sir , would now be a good time to speak with you ?
it' s always a good time , andrew .
you know that .
it is everything in one' s bank account .
why would you want to give me
to purchase one' s freedom .
one wants to be free .
one would , of course , still obey the three laws ... and serve you in exactly the same fashion .
the only thing that would change would be the form .
one would no longer be your property .
you want to leave .
that' s what this is about , isn' t it ?
not at all , sir .
you are one' s family .
then why ask for this ?
oh , i see .
you' re in on this .
we' ve talked about it , yes .
so you ordered him to do it , and he obeyed .
no .
he makes his own decisions .
but you put the idea in his head .
no , father , you did .
you' ve given him hundreds of books to read .
it was simply a matter of time before he became intrigued by the idea of freedom .
he learns and grows all the time , and it' s because of you and andrew' s abilities ... that he' s become every bit as complex as we are .
good morning , sir .
you take your check back , please , andrew .
why , sir ?
you are free now .
i must ask you to leave this house .
but sir , i don' t wish to leave .
you wished for freedom , you must accept the consequences .
then i will remove my belongings .
yes .
where will you go ?
i will look for a residence nearby ... so that if you ever need anything , sir
that will not happen , andrew , thank you .
there' s no need to be close by .
if you command me not to do this , i will obey .
i command nothing .
you' re free .
then called or uncalled i am always at your service .
andrew , you' ve stopped referring to yourself as " one .
a home of my own .
andrew ?
andrew ?
i' m in here .
little miss .
is something wrong ?
he asked for you .
it' s time .
the robot' s here .
andrew .
hello , miss .
andrew .
sir .
how are you , sir ?
well , i' m dying , andrew .
otherwise i' m fine .
wonderful to see you again .
i' m very happy to see you , andrew .
it' s been a long time .
yes , it has , sir .
i wanted to
i wanted to tell you ... that i was wrong .
you' re never wrong , sir .
then don' t contradict me .
you were right to want your freedom , and i' m glad that you have it .
thank you , sir .
andrew , you were very good to us .
it was an honor serving you , sir .
i want to seek out my own kind .
in order to understand my destiny ,
i must know if there is another like myself .
northam robotics will not return my inquiries , and now that you have finally passed the bar , lloyd ,
i want you to sue them for information of the whereabouts of all ndr series robots , if you don' t mind .
the freedom of information act doesn' t quite cover suits by robots .
not yet .
mother , i' m a very busy man .
i do not have time to help ... it pursue some ridiculous lawsuit .
lloyd , sweetheart , i do love you , but sometimes i have to wonder if you really are my child .
well , that' s mutation , mother .
the miracle of genetics is i' m not you .
no , you' ve always been more like your father .
so that' s why you divorced him .
sorry .
andrew , what would you do if i got the information on these other ndrs ?
i would seek them out , each and every one .
so you' d be gone for quite a long time .
oh , yes .
several years if not more , if my calculations are correct .
i' d love to help you .
did he not breast feed ?
dear little miss , my journey is nearing the end of its tenth year , and i still have not found any robot that bears any similarity to myself . and i still have not found any robot that bears any similarity to myself .
i have thousands of miles to go , hundreds of cities to visit , so i have not given up hope .
love , andrew .
hello .
my last name is martin .
hey , get off the field .
dear little miss , my journey is nearing its end .
i have exhausted all possibilities save for one final ray of hope .
i' ve learned of an ndr robot that has recently been rebuilt back home in san francisco .
take as many as you need .
oh , then you should love them .
i' il be right back .
take as many as you need .
thank you .
you' re quite welcome .
whoo what you want baby , i got it
whoo , whoo what you need do you know i got it
whoo , whoo all i' m askin '
is for a little respect when you come home just a little bit
hey , baby when you get home just a little bit
just a little bit just a little bit mister
i ain' t gonna do you wrong while you' re gone
ain' t gonna do you wrong if i don' t wanna whoo
whoo , whoo all i' m askin '
is for a little respect when ya come home just a little bit
baby , when you get home just a little bit
just a little bit just a little bit yeah
hi .
is this yours ?
oh .
thank you .
i' m looking for rupert burns .
oh , you' ve come to the right place .
come in .
certainly have .
huh .
do you have a name ?
of course i do .
galatea .
galatea .
you have an amazing ... agility .
you were dancing in the market .
did you like that ?
very much .
dancing is the sportiest sport , and we' re so much better at it than humans .
i can' t believe i finally found you .
when did you know ?
know what ?
that you were unique .
oh , i knew that right away .
me too .
you and i we' re the same .
we have personality !
is your personality chip turned on ?
isn' t yours ?
no .
sucks to be you !
i think personality is much more fun than intelligence , don' t you ?
baby , baby , sweet baby i think so .
there' s somethin ' that i' ve just got to say
can i help you ?
your robot is just a standard ndr , isn' t she ?
yeah , i' m afraid so .
why does she have the ability to dance ?
' cause i , uh
i put a modified skeletal chip into her during a rebuild .
how were you able to do that modification ?
my father taught me .
he created the android unit at northam robotics .
he' s responsible for the technology that allows you to mimic human expression .
what happened to him ?
well , northam laid him off when they shut down the unit , so he started this place , and i took over when he died .
i' m sorry to hear that .
he would have been absolutely thrilled to meet you .
i i i' m rupert burns .
it' s a real honor .
the honor is mine .
hey !
you and i we' re the same !
let' s get loco , robo !
whoo hoo !
shut her off or i will .
oh .
okay .
thank you .
is this your father' s work ?
yeah well , it' s it' s our work , you could say .
i haven' t really been able to restrain myself from continuing ... to tinker with the relentlessly unfashionable android technology .
as a matter of fact , i' ve actually gotten to a point ... where i can pretty much exactly replicate the external physical appearance ... of a human being .
remarkable .
thank you .
amazing !
yeah .
unfortunately , nobody seems terribly interested in funding my research .
but  i am .
i will fund your research .
yeah ?
that' d be cool .
thank you , darlin ' .
okay .
this is an external physical upgrade only in the strictest sense of the word .
you' il feel nothing .
none of your internal mechanisms will be changed .
you' il still be subject to the parameters of your positronic brain .
is that clear ?
understood .
okay , good .
now , have you given any thought whatsoever as to what age you' d like to be ?
officially , i am 62 years old .
let' s take off 25 years .
what do ya say ?
fifteen .
twenty .
good .
perfect .
now , andrew , believe it or not , the secret to all this is actually ...
imperfection .
imperfection ?
yeah .
things like ... wrinkles , uh , less than perfect teeth , details like fading scars , little pockmark
look at my nose .
see my nose ?
it' s bulbous and slightly irregular ?
it is .
well , i' m the only one who' s got my nose , and that' s what makes me , me .
we need to incorporate these features into your design ... so that you can be the only one of you .
that' s what makes us unique , is those imperfections .
i see .
like the shape of your head .
what about the shape of my head ?
it' s huge .
oh .
but lovely .
thank you .
oh .
ah .
oh .
what happened ?
what' s going on ?
what happened ?
i saw the inner me .
is it ready ?
okay .
please , be careful .
don' t drop me .
i' m being careful .
oh , my god !
just relax , relax , relax .
why did you do that ?
that wasn' t very funny . just keepin ' ya on your toes .
i don' t have any toes .
you do now .
i do .
and hands .
and fingers .
how do i look ?
see for yourself .
thank you .
beautiful .
sorry .
who are you ?
andrew .
andrew ?
you look wonderful , even younger .
how do you do that ?
do do i know you ?
well , i know i look different too .
i' ve had an upgrade .
touch it .
what ?
no , oh , no !
no .
sorry , the face .
what' s going on ?
you leave her alone !
who are you ?
andrew .
no .
andrew ?
yes .
but andrew' s a robot .
yes , i am .
well , now , an android .
he' s had an upgrade .
i know that .
oh !
hello .
hello !
it is you .
you know him ?
yes .
you know me ?
yes .
who are you ?
no ?
i' m little miss .
yes .
that' s little miss .
no .
no ?
no ?
no .
no , that' s portia .
portia ?
yes .
portia ?
yes .
who' s portia ?
my granddaughter .
your granddaughter ?
yes .
yes .
is this some kind of trick ?
no .
you' re little miss ?
yes .
why do you have to look like her ?
there is and can be only one little miss .
really ?
yes !
it' s a genetic resemblance .
sometimes it skips a generation .
i don' t care .
i don' t like it .
i can see that .
but if you took a moment , which i see you' re not inclined to do right now , you' d realize portia and i are very different people .
why is she imitating you ?
what' s so funny ?
you are .
i' m not trying to be funny .
things have certainly changed around here .
that happens after 20 years .
i have so much to tell you .
come .
come with me .
it is you .
yes .
portia .
hello , my friend .
hello , little miss .
whose daughter is she ?
lloyd' s .
oh .
now the rudeness makes sense .
go .
go home to your master .
you don' t have a home , do you ?
i don' t have food .
i don' t eat .
come in .
we' il keep each other company .
i know you don' t like me .
well , i don' t like you either .
i just wanna make that clear .
it couldn' t be more clear if you spat in my face .
i can' t .
i don' t have a mucous gland .
would it be possible to have a slightly longer conversation ?
may my canine companion enter also ?
thank you .
is this your sculpture ?
no , i' m restoring it .
i' m a preservation architect .
it' s quite horrendous .
how ugly was it before you restored it ?
listen .
first , you get mad at me because of how i look .
mm hmm .
tonight you show up at my door , announce that you don' t like me , and then you criticize my work .
once again , i apologize for telling the truth .
but it can' t be helped .
it' s my programming .
what is it exactly that you want ?
family .
my last name is martin ,
i am so named because your great grandfather and grandmother ... considered me to be a member of your family .
now , sir is dead .
little miss is getting older .
you don' t like me , but at least you' il talk to me if i knock on your door long enough .
is that a joke ?
no .
would you like to hear a joke ?
this buddhist walks up to a hot dog vendor and says ,
make me one with everything .
andrew , do you do you have any friends at all ?
no .
only woofy , who' s very sweet , but not very challenging on a conversational level .
that is the extent of his skills .
so you want someone to talk to ?
with .
even if that person doesn' t like you ?
you can' t have everything .
is that right ?
is it , " you can have everything " ?
seems like some people do , so i' m somewhat confused on that level .
sit down .
let' s talk .
thank you .
mm hmm .
hey there , handsome .
andrew , could i get you anything to drink ?
sorry , i have no stomach .
oh .
could i get something for him ?
he has a stomach .
yes .
do you think he' s hungry ?
how is she ?
she' s sleeping .
what happened ?
she had a stroke .
mm .
there you are .
little miss .
hmm .
she' s gone ?
it' s cruel that you can cry and i cannot .
here is a terrible pain i cannot express .
will every human being that i care for ... just ... leave ?
i' m afraid so .
that won' t do .
andrew , this is remarkably impressive .
you did this all by yourself ? .
yes .
i downloaded every known medical textbook into my memory .
i studied them .
that' s how i came up with these drawings .
i know they' re very primitive and not entirely complete , but that' s why i need you to fill in the mechanical gaps , rupert .
this is another upgrade .
it' s considerably more than an upgrade .
i mean , you' re
you' re talking about a profound transition ... from the mechanical to the biological .
i realize that , and i believe it is the ideal marriage of both fields .
not only that , but this stuff could cut both ways .
i don' t think that any existing prosthetic devices or artificial organs ... hold a candle to what you' ve designed here .
you could use these in human beings as well .
exactly .
wow !
what a piece of fecal matter .
shit .
excuse me ?
what a piece of shit .
i know that .
no , that' s way you say when you' re frustrated .
you say " piece of shit .
" piece of shit " ?
yes , but but with feeling .
oh .
what a piece of shit .
more .
what a piece of shit !
good , very good .
thank you .
now , are you aware that what you' ve essentially designed here ... is the equivalent of the human central nervous system ?
that was my intention , yes .
okay .
well , you gotta realize that a nervous system is going to ... radically enhance the way that you feel and perceive the world around you .
i' m not just talking about hot and cold and little tiny pinpricks .
as your experience becomes varied , so will the feelings , emotions , sensations ... stimulated by that experience .
and while some of these will be very subtle ... and wonderful and nuanced and shaded , others will be profoundly intense and difficult to tolerate .
do you feel like you' re ready for that ?
absolutely .
lovely .
thank you .
i was referring to the statue .
i know .
could you fix this piece of shit ?
i don' t know .
let me take a look .
andrew , i' m sure you could restore this yourself .
yes , i could .
but you could do it much better .
well , i' d be happy to fix it for you .
if it' s not too much effort .
no , not at all .
i' ve been working all day , and i could really use some air .
do you wanna go for a walk ?
oh , that would be quite splendid .
yes .
why are you laughing at me ?
you' re just you' re always so polite and so proper .
it' s very sweet .
thank you .
let' s go .
thank you .
when a man' s an empty kettle
he should be on his mettle
and yet i' m torn apart
it' s because i' m presumin ' that i could be kinda human
if i only had a heart
picture me do you have an impact drill ?
uh , yeah , over on the rack .
thank you .
jesus !
there' s a party next week ... to celebrate the opening of the building that i restored , and all my friends will be there , and it would be great if you could come .
i would love to .
thank you .
i think you' re letting me win .
checkmate .
i love all
the many charms
about you
above all
i want my arms
about you
don' t don' t be
a naughty , naughty baby
come to mama
come to mama , do
my sweet
embraceable
you
charles , why don' t you go get us a drink ?
sure .
thank you .
thank you .
the very thought of you
and i forget to do
the simple ordinary things
that everyone ought to do
i' m living in
a kind of daydream
i' m happy as a king
and foolish
though it may seem
to me you' re everything
the mere idea of you
though i' m here for you
you' il never know
how slow the moments go
till i' m near you
i never understood the phrase " pearls before swans .
what ?
swine .
oh ?
then the ballet is not swine lake ?
oh , god , nobody makes me laugh like you .
laughter is essential for a good friendship .
yes , it is .
sometimes i get the feeling that ... you feel a certain way about us ... and ... that you ... wish or
what ?
i don' t know .
it' s just a little
having this conversation with
a robot ?
yes .
i i mean , a thing is itself , andrew .
a tree is a tree , water is water .
you ... are a magnificent machine .
but no matter how much you change , that' s what you' il always be .
no , i can' t believe that , will not believe that .
i realize i' m not entirely human .
that' s why people don' t always like or understand me .
i like you .
you do ?
i even understand you ... some of the time .
but i
i can' t invest my emotions in a machine .
must be a genetic trait .
things change , portia .
things always change .
she laughed at me .
a thing is itself , andrew .
water is water .
what about ice ?
what about steam , hmm ?
andy , you gotta calm down , okay ?
do you know what it' s like to be laughed at ?
humiliating .
it' s an abomination .
look at me .
look what i' m doing here .
i am trying to make something of myself .
i am trying to fulfill my destiny .
does she notice ?
andrew ?
yes ?
i don' t want you to take this personally , but i have to work now .
good night .
good ni
where' ve you been ?
i' ve been trying to call you .
poke me in the eye .
poke me in the eye , portia .
what ?
you' re crazy .
poke me in the eye !
ow !
ow !
that hurts .
ow .
it works .
what the hell is going on ?
it' s my neural net .
i am the proud owner of a central nervous system .
you can feel .
oh , yes , very much .
will you do something for me ?
will you perform an experiment just for the sake of science ?
all right .
kiss me .
no , not there .
here .
thank you .
could you feel it ?
it' s wonderful .
it' s everything they say it is .
and you ?
portia , what' s wrong ?
charles and i are getting married .
he' s a lucky man .
congratulations to the both of you .
goddamn it , andrew .
if you' re gonna succeed at this thing  what thing ?
this thing you' re trying to do you' ve got to stop being so damn deferential .
i can' t help being deferential .
it' s built in .
then change .
change ?
i have changed .
i don' t mean on the outside .
change on the inside .
take chances , make mistakes .
mistakes ?
yes !
sometimes it' s important not to be perfect , okay ?
it' s important to do the wrong thing .
do the wrong thing ?
yes !
why ?
oh , i see to learn from your mistakes .
no , to make them .
to find out what' s real and what' s not .
to find out what you feel .
human beings are terrible messes , andrew .
i' il grant you that .
i see .
this is what is known as an irrational conversation , isn' t it ?
no , this is a human conversation .
it' s not about being rational .
it' s about following your heart .
and that' s what i should do ?
yes .
and you have a heart , andrew .
you do .
i feel it .
i don' t even believe it sometimes , but i do feel it .
and in order to follow that heart ,
one must do the wrong thing .
yes .
thank you .
galatea , could you be a little more careful ?
that' s very delicate equipment .
sorry .
what are you doing ?
near as i can tell , your bitch work .
my what ?
oh , you heard me , and i' m sick of it !
all day long it' s , " yes , rupert , sir , " " no , rupert , sir .
would you like another beverage , rupert , sir ?
and it chaps my ass !
shut up , and let me do my work !
no , no .
i' m done .
chaps my ass " ?
give me back the chip .
where' s the chip ?
i replaced it .
andrew , she' s uncooperative , she' s abusive , she' s confrontational
and a lot more interesting , don' t you think ?
arguably , but we' re not getting any work done , andrew .
please , please , give me the old personality chip back .
fine .
she can be perky again .
perky ?
she' s just a ro i didn' t mean it that way .
andrew ?
andrew !
i really didn' t mean that .
what' s the matter with you today ?
andrew , where you going ?
hey , jamiee , come over here .
i want you to meet charles .
charles , my aunt jamie .
hi , nice to meet you .
this is ryan .
hey , ryan .
this is michael .
the boys are great .
rupert !
what' s going on ?
what' s going on ?
portia' s parents are throwing an engagement party ...
that i wasn' t invited to for obvious reasons .
yeah .
there he is .
who ?
the prospective groom .
where ?
where ?
the one in the pale blue suit with the big pointy chin .
he' s got a pointy chin ?
pointy chin ?
you could put an eye out with that chin .
yeah , that' s nothing compared to his teeth .
look at that .
i' m amazed he' s out in daylight .
he' s got funny teeth , huh ?
you need to upgrade your eyes .
that shouldn' t stop portia .
she can marry whoever she likes .
it' s just that one day she' s gonna wake up next to him and realize ... that she is married to a man whose face closely resembles an antique can opener .
you know ?
the kind that used to go [ clicking ]
you know ?
the ones that move around and can pops off .
you' re jealous .
you are jealous .
no , i' m not .
no , i' m not .
you are .
otherwise what are you doing sneaking around here , spying on portia , huh ?
my god , i am jealous .
if i' m jealous , that means i' m in love .
hi !
oh , thanks for coming .
if i' m in love , then all hope is gone .
i' ve lost her .
andrew .
andrew !
andy , would you like a sip of my beer ?
it would be a waste .
i could not taste it .
what if you could ?
it would be exquisite .
i' ve come up with a design a modification , rather that , if i' m correct , would enable you to deal with solid foods and liquids .
and taste ?
taste too .
and also , [ exhaling ]
if my schematics are correct ,
i think i' ve come up with a method ... to make you ... a complete man .
complete ?
complete .
complete ?
not in a reproductive sense , of course , but in terms of approximating ... the physical sensation , you know , that occurs
friction
sexual relations .
yeah .
oh , i' ve always been fascinated by that .
well , i mean , curious ... because
well , because of what they say .
what do they say ?
that you can lose yourself everything , all boundaries , all time the two bodies can become so mixed up ... that you don' t know who' s who or what' s what .
and just when the sweet confusion is so intense you think you' re gonna die , you kind of do ,
leaving you alone in your separate body .
but the one you love is still there .
that' s a miracle .
you can go to heaven and come back alive .
you can go back anytime you want with the one you love .
and you want to experience that ?
oh , yes , please .
so do i.
we' il have to hire more people .
maybe two more weeks .
andrew .
excuse me .
i' il be right back .
sure .
i didn' t expect to see you .
i remember this place very well .
this is where your grandmother was married .
yeah , i wanted it ready for my own wedding .
so , you' re not married yet ?
no , two weeks from saturday .
i' m not too late .
are you absolutely positive you' re doing the right thing ?
positive ?
about getting married ?
i' m never absolutely positive .
so you could be doing the wrong thing .
no , i' m pretty sure i' m doing the right thing .
great .
why is that great ?
in your apartment , you told me to do the wrong thing .
now , you are not doing the wrong thing .
you' re doing the right thing .
it' s safe to say you' re not following your own advice , ' cause if you were , you would definitely not be marrying this man , charles .
because i would be doing the right thing .
precisely .
in some strange way , you' re starting to make sense .
good .
do you have any idea what it' s like to be in love with someone ... who' s about to marry someone else ?
someone totally magnificent , someone who walks into a room and lights it up like the sun ?
someone who you know is lying to herself ?
lying ?
convincingly , yeah .
very , very much so .
about what ?
that you don' t love me , when i know at least in some way you do .
and how do you know that ?
portia ,
i have done everything inside and out .
but that stuff doesn' t matter to me .
well , something matters ,
' cause i' d have to believe if nothing mattered , you' d love me ... and not some man whose chin could sink the titanic .
what ?
see ?
it' s true , isn' t it ?
i' m sorry .
does he light you up like this ?
does he make you laugh ?
nobody makes me laugh like this .
good .
then admit it .
admit that you love me .
give me one kiss .
oh , god .
that' s all .
one quick kiss . just one kiss ... could not jeopardize a glorious marriage .
besides , it would also explain to me why your pulse jumped from 66 to 102 beats per minute .
your respiration rate has doubled .
you' re putting out clouds of pheromones .
it' s not fair to read me like that .
i know .
love isn' t fair .
i' m reading your heart .
i' m asking you to follow it begging you .
begging is supposed to be humiliating .
i don' t care .
i love you , portia .
i loved you the very first moment i saw you .
i thought you said a quick kiss .
i lied .
how do you feel ?
wonderful .
so do i.
i guess that' s the point .
what was that ?
that' s your stomach growling .
you' re hungry .
was that me ?
yes .
i thought it was you .
no , it wasn' t me .
really ?
ooh .
do you do that ?
sometimes .
quieter than that .
ah .
i' il have to have rupert make me a muffler .
mm hmm .
it' s wonderful .
it' s wonderful the taste and the texture both .
you know , it' s marvelous .
i know this will be my fourth helping , but may i please have some more ?
pig very smart animal .
obviously not that smart if it ends up as bacon .
i feel like i' m eating my way through the entire food chain .
thank you .
what ?
what' s wrong ?
if we' re together you and me we' il never be accepted .
because i' m not human .
that will not do .
i will have to get started .
started with what ?
the next step .
i love you .
wish me luck .
andrew martin , step forward , please .
so , mr. martin , you would like us to pass a bill ... declaring you a human being .
yes , specifically the ability to marry ...
a fellow human being .
i see .
we have to face the undeniable fact ... that no matter how much you may be like a human being , you are not part of the human gene pool .
you are outside of it entirely .
you are something else , something artificial .
sir , what about all the real people wading in the gene pool ... who have bodies full of prosthetic devices , many of which i have invented .
you yourself , sir , have one of my kidneys , do you not ?
are you not in some way artificial , at least in part ?
in part , yes .
well , then , i' m human in part .
which part , andrew ?
this one , sir .
i see .
and here ?
it is true i am still equipped with a positronic brain .
and because of that positronic brain , you are , for all accounts , immortal .
yes , sir .
well , andrew , society can tolerate an immortal robot , but we will never tolerate an immortal human .
it arouses too much jealousy , too much anger .
i' m sorry , andrew .
this court cannot and will not validate your humanity .
i hereby bring an end to these proceedings .
it is the decision of this court ... that andrew martin from this day forward ... will continue to be declared a robot a mechanical machine , nothing more .
one is glad to be of service .
andrew , i have to tell you ...
i' m beginning to feel not so sure .
about us ?
no .
next week will be my 75th birthday .
i know , and you look 50 .
thank you .
a spectacular 50 .
but i don' t feel 50 .
your body does .
last night was amazing .
what was that called again ?
shut up and listen to me .
sorry .
and don' t give me that look .
i' m not ordering you around .
whatever you say .
please don' t be agreeable .
i' m not being agreeable .
i can be if you want .
oh , goddamn it , andrew , i' m trying to tell you something important here .
i' m not going to live forever .
yes , you will .
that' s why i invented
no , no , i won' t always take your d. n. a. elixirs .
i won' t have all my organs replaced .
eventually i' m going to wear out .
and i want to .
why would you want to leave ?
there' s an ... order to things .
human beings are meant to be here for a certain time and then pass on .
that' s what' s right .
i see .
there' s just one problem , portia .
what ?
i couldn' t stand to live without you .
andrew , people grow through time , but then , of course , for you time is a completely different proposition .
for you , time is endless .
there' s only one thing to do .
galatea , my dear , where are we ?
the transfusion is almost complete .
is that so ?
just goes to show you , andrew , somebody becomes a human being , sooner or later , they do something monumentally stupid .
you' ve been a great example , rupert .
how quickly will the blood degrade my system ?
oh , i don' t know .
you exercise , eat right , i' d say 30 , 40 years .
that' s a little vague , chief .
you don' t know exactly how long i' il last ?
sorry .
welcome to the human condition .
andrew martin
i have always tried to make sense of things .
there must be some reason i am as i am .
as you can see , madam chairman ,
i am no longer immortal .
you have arranged to die ?
in a sense , i have .
i am growing old , and my body is deteriorating , and , like all of you , it will eventually cease to function .
as a robot , i could' ve lived forever .
but i tell you all today ,
i would rather die a man ... than live for all eternity as a machine .
why do you want this ?
to be acknowledged ... for who and what i am no more , no less .
not for acclaim , not for approval .
the simple truth of that recognition this has been the elemental drive of my existence , and it must be achieved , if i am to live or die ... with dignity .
mr. martin , what you are asking for is ... extremely complex and controversial .
it will not be an easy decision .
i must ask for your patience ... while i take the necessary time to make a determination ... of this extremely delicate matter .
i await your decision , madam chairman .
thank you for your patience .
we tried .
is it almost time ?
in a few minutes .
it doesn' t matter what the world congress says .
why do you need their approval ?
old habit .
i started my existence as a robot .
i still like to be told certain things .
it' s time .
ladies and gentlemen , ms. marjorie bota ,
president of the world congress .
according to records of the northam robotics company , the robot , also known as andrew martin , was powered up at 5 : 15 p . m . , on april 3 , 2005 .
in a few hours , he will be 200 years old , which means that , with the exception of methuselah and other biblical figures ,
andrew is the oldest living human being in recorded history .
for it is by this proclamation ... that i validate his marriage to portia charney ... and acknowledge his humanity .
andrew ?
i' m sorry he didn' t see it .
maybe he didn' t need to .
could you do me a favor ?
would you mind unplugging me ?
that' s an order .
thank you , galatea .
as the great andrew martin used to say ,
one is glad to be of service .
i' il see you soon .
laugh and cry
live and die
life is a dream
we all dream it
day by day
i find my way
look for the soul
and the meaning
then you look at me
and i always see
what i have been searching for
i' m lost as can be
then you look at me
and i am not lost anymore
people run
sun to sun
caught in their lives
ever flowing
one sweet dawn
life goes till it' s gone
we have to go
where it' s going
then you look at me
and i always see
what i have been searching for
i' m lost as can be
then you look at me
and i am not lost
anymore
and you say you see
when you look at me
the reason you love life so
though lost i have been
i find love again
and life just keeps on running
and life just keeps on running
you look at me
and life holds love for
you
for
you
