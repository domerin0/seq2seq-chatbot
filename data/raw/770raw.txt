give yourselves a great big hand .
you deserve it .
and i want a big , fat christmas bonus .
just kidding , but not really , because ... ... i am so excited , i am so on fire , i am so guts and glory passionate about what i am about to show you .
so get ready , because on monday nights the whole world will be watching a man , a woman and a buzzerl
are you ready for the final gender challenge ?
who makes more money ?
i do .
who enters ironman triathlons every year and wins ?
i do .
who secretly wishes they were married to a hot , sexy lesbian ?
i dol i dol
it' s taral
and ... ... on thursdays ...
no , this is not just a tv show .
no , this is a breakthrough , a breakout , a break all the rules and bring on the emmys mega smashl
yesl
can i present to you this planet' s ultimate reality phenomenon ?
i can do better !
we will all be right there as happily married couples are flown first class to a tropical island paradise where they will be completely surrounded by professional prostitutes .
and at the end of the week ...
well , let' s take a peek .
well , it' s been a week , and hank , our personnel manager from omaha , has spent the entire seven days with vanessa , our call girl and exotic dancer .
yeah , it' s been amazing .
and i' il admit we' ve had some fun in the hot tub and all .
but you wanna know something , billy ?
all we did was talk ... ... because i love my wife ... ... and the only place i want to be is back in omaha with my barbara .
tough break , nessa .
and barbara , you spent monday with rocky , our bodybuilder and male escort ,
tuesday through thursday with the entire cast of the xxx film hung jury , and you spent the entire weekend with tonkiro .
and now it' s time for the final decision .
barbara , it' s yours to make .
is it gonna be omaha ?
or " oma hunks " ?
well ... ... before i came on this show i only had sex with one man , and that was usually hank .
i love hank deeply and forever with all my heart , and i would never do anything to hurt him .
but i can do betterl
the battle of the sexes , as old as time but as ...
why ?
excuse me ?
why did you do it ?
oh , my god , it' s hank from i can do better !
hank , everyone .
no , stop it .
i love barbara .
i had a family .
i had a life .
hank ,
i know it hurts .
love isn' t easy .
relationships aren' t easy , not for anyone .
but now you know the truth about barbara , and you are gonna move on with your life .
and you' re gonna meet someone wonderful , and america is gonna love you .
yeah .
i' ve got a great idea for another hot new show .
well , tell it to us .
it' s called ... ... let' s kill all the women .
he' s got a gunl
joanna , are you all right ?
i am great .
raring to go .
the police were sensational .
and not a scratch .
you haven' t heard ?
about what ?
that man , hank .
right before he tried to kill you , he went to see his ex wife and five of her new boyfriends .
he did ?
he shot all of them .
the wife is in critical condition , and four of the guys are on life support .
tonkiro ?
he' s fine .
thank god .
so you know what this means .
of course .
we pay for all of their medical treatment , every penny .
we get them the very best therapist , childcare , rehab , whatever they need , and then we fly them to new york , first class , for a prime time special ,
let the healing begin .
you' re not listening .
we can' t wear this .
the lawsuits alone may bankrupt the network .
and all your new shows , the whole lineup , the affiliates won' t touch them .
we have shareholders .
we can' t let you sink the network .
but we wish you only the best .
of course .
thank you for being so classy and taking this so well .
joanna , we just wanted to say that this is so not fair .
goodbye , everybodyl
all the bestl
jo ?
walter .
what happened ?
well , you' ve had a complete nervous collapse .
and the doctors say there' s a lot of work to do , but you' re gonna be just fine .
oh , and pete made this for you .
oh , that' s so sweet .
isn' t it ?
and i wanted you to know that the minute i heard the news ,
i called the network and i quit .
you did that for me ?
of course .
i know i was only a vice president , but i could never work for those people , not after the way they treated you .
oh , walter ...
and do you remember what today is ?
it' s our anniversary .
oh , walter ... ... l' m so sorry .
maybe that man who tried to shoot me , maybe he was right .
maybe i' ve become the wrong kind of woman .
maybe i' ve made all of the wrong decisions .
could we get away and start over ?
and get it right , our marriage ?
but why are we moving ?
to connecticut ?
we' re moving so that we can all kick back and have a great new life in this beautiful new town .

stepford is connecticut' s family paradise .
it has no crime , no poverty and no pushing .
what is that ?
up on the hill ?
well , that' s our stepford men' s association .
where all our wonderful guys can get together and stay out of our hair .

i mean , why , imagine if our husbands saw us in worn , dark , urban sweat clothes with stringy hair and almost no makeup ?
oh , good heavens .
now , today you are in for a special treat because we are working on a series of exercises which i' ve personally invented , based on simple household tasks .

everything isn' t always about you , jo .
walter .
she' il be fine .
it' s too much sun .
she' s dehydrated .

jo .
i' m sorry about this , mike .
joanna .

i would like you to meet ...
mike wellington .
my husband .

they don' t do you justice .
excuse me , that woman is very sick .
thank you .
i should be going with her .
she' il get all the help she needs .
trust me , little lady .
that woman had a seizure , and she was practically levitating .
and i have told you five million times i phoned herb .
he said that sarah is fine .
she just needed some fluids , just like mike said .
she was sparking , walter .
she was dancing .
then why wasn' t there a doctor anywhere ?
and why ... ?
why ... ?
walterl walterl and why did everyone just automatically listen to that mike person ?
and why , why was everyone just standing there ?
you mean why weren' t they just listening to you ?
that' s not what i' m sayingl jesus christ , joannal
what ?
you were fired , your kids barely know you , and our marriage is falling apart .
and your whole attitude makes people want to kill you .
it makes people try to kill you .
that' s what we' re doing here .
the people in this town have been nothing but friendly and welcoming and wonderful to you .
and you' ve been nothing but snide and suspicious .
and on top of that , at the picnic you humiliated me .
well , i can' t do it anymore .
i can' t keep fighting you for every inch of everything .
game over .
marriage over .
oh , nol
nol no what ?
please don' t go .
why not ?
because you' re right .
wait , i' m sorry .
i don' t think i heard that .
what did you just say ?
i said , you' re right .
about ?
about everything .
about me .
do you know why i signed on at the network ?
because i thought that if i was around , i could help you lighten up .
you did ?
yeah , i did .
what was that one show called ?
i can do everybody ?
see , that' s what i mean .
i wanted to make you laugh .
that' s so sweet , but i ...
i was busy .
i was running a network , walter .
you were so busy that we haven' t made love in over a year .
i know .
i ...
well , i miss you .
but i' ve always loved you so much .
i ...
you know that .
why ?
because ...
because ... ... you' re goofy , and you' re ...
you' re handsome , and you' re ...
you' re ...
you' re my walter .
and because when you play computer chess you do that little ...
you do that little victory dance .
i do not .
i don' t do that .
yes , you do .
no , i don' t .
but if i' m not the smartest and the best of the best and the most successful , then i don' t know , who am i ?
you wanna find out ?
how ?
first of all , we' re in the country now , so no more black .
no more black ?
are you insane ?
you heard me .
only high powered , neurotic , castrating ,
manhattan career bitches wear black .
is that what you wanna be ?
ever since i was a little girl .
do i really look ok ?
can i be honest ?
you look kind of like betty crocker .
i know .
at betty ford .
we need milk .
we need milk .
we need milk .
thank you .
look , i' m trying to make an effort to change .
i mean , last night my husband was a different person .
he was strong , he was forceful , he was commanding .
like your refrigerator .
well , nobody said it was gonna be easy being a homemaker and a stay at home mom .
it' s the toughest job in the world , right ?
well , that may be , but these stepford women ,
they' re a whole other dimension .
oh , like yesterday , that poor lady , sarah sunderson .
walter said she' s fine .
but you said she was shooting off sparks from her ears .
now , that' s the first sign .
of what ?
cheap jewelry .
we should go see her .
why ?
because we need to be supportive .
that' s how people behave outside of manhattan .
they care about each other .
i mean , if you were in new york and one of your neighbors got sick
what would you do ?
we' d call her .
to see if she was gonna die .
so we could get the apartment .
let' s go .
up .
up .
up .
sarah ?
yoo hoo .
yoo hoo ?
is she in there ?
what are you doing ?
it' s open .
that' s amazing .
so sweet .
and so trusting .
roger .
roger .
look at this place .
wow .
sarah ?
sarah ?
roger .
oh , herb .
oh , baby .
oh , yes .
oh , yes .
make me begl yeahl
oh , i' m so luckyl
oh , my god .
is that a dvd ?
no , it' s them .
oh , you' re the kingl
yesl
i' m going up there .
why ?
rogerl i want some .
roger .
roger .
baby , grab me some nachos .
yes , dear .
what' s this ?
roger , put it down .
what ?
oh , come on .
roger .
why does it say sarah ?
roger , you should put it down now .
let' s get out of here .
this isn' t our house .
oh , stop .
would you just quit ?
we have to , roger .
for god' s sake , we' re trespassing .
we have to get out of here .
put it down .
come on .
ok , let' s try and use this .
we have to go .
i' m so embarrassed .
i' m mortified .
i' m famished .
bobbie .
yeah ?
are you making anthrax ?
excuse me .
i' ve been busy .
my new book .
but can' t you hire someone to clean ?
someone brave ?
dave says i got to do it myself , like sarah sunderson .
oh , could you believe her ?
but , darling , her home is spotless .
and she' s having incredible sex in the middle of the day with her husband .
well , i' m sorry , but my shrink says i need creative chaos .
my therapist says i need boundaries .
my doctor said i need enough electricity to jumpstart vegas .
you ever done zoloft ?
kid stuff .
xanax .
i worship xanax .
i' m old fashioned .
i like prozac with a viagra chaser .
you' re up , and you' re up .
oh , roger .
viagra .
hey , is there something that you need to tell us ?
well ...
sharing .
ok .
ok .
jerry and i have been in couple' s counseling ... ... for over a year ... ... and finally ...
finally , i just couldn' t take it anymore .
i howled , " you' ve become a gay republican .
and he said , " what' s wrong with that ?
i said , " what' s wrong with that ?
that' s like wanting to be gay with a bad haircut .
exactly .
so the counselor suggested that we move to the ' burbs .
to find a balance .
we moved here as a last resort .
court order .
don' t ask .
ok .
i know this is unthinkable , but what if we could actually learn how to be happy ... ... without paxil or compulsive overeating ?
what if we actually gave this whole thing a try for real , the whole stepford thing ?
hey , yeahl only one can survive .
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !

and ted owes walter 20 big onesl
ah , to be a man .
so , walt , you and stepford , it seems like a real match .
i' il say .
i mean , the town and the houses .
this place .
well , it' s like a dream .
it' s like ...
like the way life was meant to be .
and all of your wives .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
they' re so ...
so ...
sweet ?
sizzling ?
super fine ?
well ...
we are all so thrilled to be here at the stepford book club ,
i can' t tell you .
now , i have just finished the third volume of robert caro' s life of lyndon johnson , and i am dying for the next installment .
well ...
that' s all marvelous , but today we are going to discuss ...
well , it is probably the most important book any of us will ever read .
yes , it is provocative , but it is also inspiring .
the heritage hills special edition golden deluxe treasury of christmas keepsakes and collectibles .
this book said to me ,
let' s celebrate the birth of our lord jesus christ with yarn .
now , bobbie , we all realize you' re probably feeling a bit uncomfortable with this week' s book because you' re ...
oh , what' s the word i' m looking for ?
new ?
scared ?
cranky ?
jewish .
same thing .
but the heritage hill series is very inclusive .
in fact , there is a whole chapter about hanukkah .
i just love the chapter on pinecones .
they' re not just for wreaths and centerpieces .
you can use pinecones to create a very special yuletide menorah .
your pinecone snowman could be jewish .
just add one of those little beanies .
or maybe i could just use hundreds of pinecones to spell out the words " big jew " in letters 15 feet tall in the snow in my front yard .
that' s a wonderful idea .
oh , yes , yes .
that' s very wonderful .
yes .
she' s so smart .
i love the idea of creating a life sized santa claus ,
all out of pinecones .
ok , i love that .
i' m going to use a pinecone in my nativity as the baby jesus .
and i' m going to attach a pinecone to my vibrator and have a really merry christmas .
here comes santa claus here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
he' s got a bag that' s filled with toys for the boys and girls again
hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle what a beautiful sight
so jump in bed , cover up your head because santa claus comes tonight
who ?
santa claus comes tonight
joanna , how is she fitting in ?
well ...
ok ...
i' m among friends , right ?
of course .
yeah .
so ...
joanna and i had this big talk , and we were really open with each other .
i mean , we really got it all out .
and i think from now on ... ... she' s gonna be very , very different .
you think joanna' s really going to change ?
yes , i do .
absolutely .
and how long have you been married ?
tedl yes .
don' t you owe walter $20 ?
that' s absolutely right , i do .
babel

we' re not spying .
we' re just visiting .

all the women around here are perfect sex kitten bimbos .
all the men are drooling nerds .
doesn' t that seem strange ?
not to me .
why not ?
i work in television .
oh , come on .
you know , walter , i think joanna is right .
i think stepford is the answer .
she' s a great gal .
or she will be .
come on , help me up .
we shouldn' t be here .
oh , come on .
don' t be such a chicken .
i should be home with my cupcakes .

we' re trespassing .
only if we get caught .
damn , i can' t see a thing .
oh , there' s the light .
there it is .
no , bobbie .
this is like some alien freak show .

roger .
roger .

mrs. walter kresby .

no .
now he' s making speeches in a brooks brothers suit .
hey , there' s lots of ways to be gay .
don' t try to make him into a stereotype .
bobbie is right , and she' s leaving too .
this place does something to people .
all of the women are always busy and perfect and smiling , and all of the men are always happy .
and that' s a problem because ... ?
because it' s not normal , walter .
it' s ...
it' s not the world .
it' s not us .
and i' m picking up our kids from camp right now , and we' re getting out of here .
with or without you .
secure .
you' il never change , will you ?
not really .
open the door .

if you' re that unhappy , then we should move .
maybe head back to the city .
we could leave tomorrow .

and my husband and my family and making a perfect home .
it' s a lesson every gal needs to learn .
especially you .
i' m your friend , joanna .
i' m going to help you .
you need me .
you stay away from me .
you' re driven .
well , sometimes .
and you' re selfish .
you wanna rule the world .
no .
i can fix you .
i can change you .
what ... have ... they ... done to you ?
let' s get busy .
answer the phone .
hello , is ... ?
is this the day camp ?
oh .
yes , this is ...
this is joanna eberhart .
i would like to speak to my children .
i' m coming to pick them up right now .
what ?
walterl
walter , where are you ?
i know you' ve got the kids .
pete , kimberlyl
oh , boys .
welcome .
where are my children ?
they' re perfectly safe .
where are my children ?
you' il see them soon .
where' s walter ?
how could you do this ?
ever since we met , you' ve beaten me at everything .
you' re better educated .
you' re stronger , you' re faster .
you' re a better dancer , a better tennis player .
you' ve always earned at least six figures more than i could ever dream of .
you' re a better speaker , a better executive .
you' re even better at sex .
don' t deny it .
i wasn' t going to .
well , don' t i get anything ?
you got me .
no , i got to hold your purse .
i got to tell the kids that you' d be late again .
i got to tell the press that you had no comment .
i got to work for you .
with me .
under you .
all of us .
we married wonder women .
supergirls .
amazon queens .
well , you know what that makes us ?
smart , worthy , lucky .
we' re the wuss .
the wind beneath your wings .
your support system .
we' re the girl .
and we don' t like it .
no , we don' t .
yeah , that' s right .
you' re damn right .
yeah .
that' s right .
and is this your answer , to kill us ?
oh , no .
nothing like that .
we help you .
we perfect you .
by turning us into robots ?
does any fraction of these women still exist ?
of course .
almost everything .
shall we show her ?
show me what ?
it' s a promotional thing i' ve been working on for when we go global .
walter , i don' t think you' ve seen this .
some guys ask , how do we do it ?
in layman' s terms , it' s really pretty simple .
come on along .
first , we take a gloomy , dissatisfied woman .
then , in a very private experience between husband and wife , he gently places her in our female improvement system .
it' s fully automated .
and then , abracadabra .
her transformation begins .
first , we locate her brain .
we inse rt a few nanochips .
then we program them .
also , we add some secret , special ingredients .
to avoid any accidents , her husband is kept at a comfo rt able distance .
safety first .
finally , we enhance her , to fit the ideal stepford wife specifications .
and ... ... voil !
everything is copasetic .
welcome to the future .
it' s a painting again .
i should explain .
you see , my real name isn' t mike .
it' s just a nickname from where i used to work .
where ?
microsoft .
nasa .
disney .
aol .
is that why the women are so slow ?
joanna .
is this what you really want ?
women who behave like slaves , women who are obsessed with cleaning their kitchens and doing their hair , women who never challenge you in any way , women who exist only to wait on you hand and foot ?
yeah .
that sounds good to me .
joanna , you' re a brilliant woman .
surely you can appreciate , at the very least , the genius of the concept .
picture , if you could streamline your spouse , if you could overhaul every annoying habit , every physical flaw , every moment of whining and nagging and farting in bed .
imagine ... ... if you could enjoy the person you loved , but only at their very best .
and the only reason for your anger , your resentment , your rage is really very simple .
you' re furious because we thought of it first .
while you were trying to become men , we decided to become gods .
let me ask you something , these machines , these stepford wives , can they say , " i love you " ?
mike .
of course .
fifty eight languages .
but do they mean it ?
enjoy .
walter .
walt .
joanna .
right here .
sarah .
claire .
marianne .
charmaine .
roger .
roberta .
oh , mikel

good evening , everyone .
what a delight to see all of our wonderful wives and their happy , happy husbands .
tonight is truly the highlight of our year because tonight we honor our very newest citizens of stepford .
in my opinion , they are the cream of the crop in couple that proudly proclaims stepford the american way of love .
now ... ... l' d like to ask my wonderful woman , my lovely wife , my bride , my best friend , to join me in a glorious midsummer night' s waltz .
yeah .

mikel mikel
men , control your wives .

this is not stepford .
mike , what' s happening ?
i was in the garden , and i was dreaming of your ...
your smile and your after shave .
and i realized ... ... i can do better .
walt .
she' s not a robot .
what ?
what ?
what , she' s not a robot ?
she never was .
wait a second .
i couldn' t do it .
what ?
why not ?
because she' s not a science project .
because i didn' t marry something from radioshack .
that' s a shame .
no .
that' s a man .
i thought you were ready .
i thought ...
i thought you were ready .
i thought i knew you .
you' re a disgrace .
to everything this town stands for .
to the future .
that' s right , that' s right .
tell him .
you' re gonna have to pay for that .
don' t you touch him .
nol
he' s a stepford husband ?
an angel .
now he' s just ... ... spare parts , thanks to you .
but what are you ?
are you a person or a machine ?
i' m a lady .
a real lady ?
every inch .
wait .
wait , a real , real lady ?
are you a human being ?
yes , and i may very well be the only decent human being left .
in stepford ?
in the worldl
she' s fabulous .
all of this , mike , the wives , stepford , this was all your idea ?
yes .
all i wanted was a better world .
a world where men were men and women were cherished and lovely .
does anyone have a screwdriver ?
she' s nuts .
a world of romance and beauty , of tuxedos and chiffon , a perfect world .
but you were married to a robot .
the perfect man .
and all i wanted was to make you , all of you ... ... into perfect women .
we don' t need to be perfect .
how could you do this to us ?
because i was just like you .
overstressed , overbooked , under loved .
i was the world' s foremost brain surgeon and genetic engineer .
i had top secret contracts with the pentagon , apple and mattel .
i was driven .
exhausted .
until late one night , i came home to find ... ... mike .
with patricia .
my brilliant ... ... blond ... ... 21 year old research assistant .
it was all so ... ... ugly .
then early the next morning , as i gazed across the breakfast table at their lifeless bodies , i thought ... ... " what have i done ?
but more importantly ... ... what i could do to make the world more beautiful ?
i had the skills .
but i needed help to realize my larger vision .
and so i made ... ... mike .
because he was someone other men would listen to .
and then i asked myself ,
where would people never notice a town full of robots ?
connecticut .
so i decided to turn back the clock , to a time before overtime , before quality time , before women were turning themselves into robots .
back offl sorry .
why didn' t you change the men too ?
that' s next .
you' re insane .
i' m in love with a waltz and a town ... ... and a man .
so , joanna , you produced the hard hitting documentary ,
the secret of the suburbs .
and won ...
five emmys , was it ?
oh , six .
she' s shy .
and so humble .
and , bobbie , your ordeal has lead to a bestseller .
you know , i just can' t hold a grudge .
so i' ve written my very first book of poetry .
and it' s all about hope and communication and the healing power of love .
what is it called ?
wait until he' s asleep , then cut it off .
it' s a page turner .
i cried .
now , roger , good news .
you ran and won .
you' re in the state senate .
independent .
next stop , the white house .
yes , this country needs highlights .
that' s our hero .
and , jo , walter really came through for you , so how' s your marriage now ?
is everything just perfect ?
no way .
but we' re doing just great .
because , um ...
because now , now we know for sure that it' s not about perfection .
perfect .
perfect doesn' t work .
what about all those other husbands ?
are they still angry ?
do they still want all these women to be robots ?
of course .
men are pigs .
they' re disgusting , they' re frightened , repulsive little rodents .
but we' re trying to help them , right , bobbie ?
right .
yes , we' re trying to reeducate them .
and where are they ?
oh .
oh , they' re still in stepford .
under house arrest .
hey , you guys .
which aisle is quilted paper towels ?
if i don' t get the right kind , my wife' s gonna kill me .
oh , aisle three .
and i need ...
no talking , keep shopping .

get bush out of america !
