hello , michael .
i want to play a game .
so far , what you call this your life , you' ve been living watching other .
the society calls you a informer , a rat , a snitch .
i call you unworthy of the body you posses , of the life that have been given .
now , we will see if you are willing the to look in world better than that , to give up the one thing you rely on in order to go on living .
the device arround your neck is a death mask .
the mask is on a spring timer .
if you do not locate the key in time , the mask will close .
think at this like a carnivorous plant .
what are you looking right now is your own body no more than two hours ago .
don' t worry .
you were put to sleep and can' t feel a thing .
taking to account that you are a great disadvantage here , i am going to give a hint from where hidden the key .
so listen carefully .
the hint is this : it' s right behind your eye !
how much blood you would share to stay alive , michael .
live or die .
it' s your choice .

i guess you never been drunk before .
i' ve been drunk ... three years ago in college . ... that is not drunk .

i watched that movie in tv last week .
this guy was a reporter
it was in that war zone , right ?
he will sleep at his hotel room and when he wakes up , he is in a cell , without windows and no light .
and he spend 9 years in that room .
9 years ?
that' s nothing .
get over it .
what do you mean get over it ?
i mean stop bitching about it and let' s do something .
i think we should calm down .
shut up .
i heard something .
what is it ?
it' s ticking .
i hear a ticking .
hey , calm down .

what are you looking for ?
what is this ?
everything what we need to know is on this .
greetings .
and welcome .
i trust that you all are wondering where you are .
i can assure you that your location it is not important , what this walls offer for you is important .
salvation .
if you earn it , three hours from now the door to this house will open .
but unfortunatelly you have two hours to live .
right now , you are breathing a deadly nerve agent . you' ve been breathing since you arrived here .
as you are familiar with tokio subway attacks will know it' s devastating effects on the the human body .
the only way to overcome it and walk out that door , it is to find the antidote .
somewhere hide arround this house .
one of them is inside that safe in front of you .
you all possess the combination of the safe .
think hard .
the numbers are in the back of your mind .
the clues of the order can be found over the rainbow .
once you will realize what you have in common you will be in better understanding why you are here .
x mark the spot of the clue .
so , look carefully .
let the game begin .
who is this ?
what did you mean ?
how did you know where to find this ?
that is bullshit .
do not attempt to use this key on the door to this room .
fuck his rulles .
yeah , fuck this .
that' s a good idea .
no , no , this is not a good idea .
so what will gonna do ?
will sit here ?
the note said not to use the key .
who does give a shit about the note ?
this all is a fucking big bad joke .
and i' m about to end it .
better start to talk right now .
what is this ?
it' s a game .
ain' t no fucking game .
his face was just blown out .
he is testing us .
who is testing us ?
jigsaw .
who the hell is jigsaw ?
do you read the fucking news ?
no , who is he ?
he is a serial killer .
no , is not .
he is testing us .
he wants us to survive this but we have to play by the fucking rules .
i will ask again , how does that know all this ?
because i' ve played before .
the tactics team is coming now to discover where the video come .
what do you want from me ?
a little of your time , detective .
i don' t have time .
you asked me when i want and i told you .
believe me when i tell you , your son is in a lot of troule .
if i' il give a litile of my time , what then ?
i just want to talk to you .
everyone else must leave .
those are my conditions .
no , it' s a crime scene .
nobody leaves .
they don' t have to leave the building , they just have to live this area
long enough for me to talk with you .
if agree to with that , then you will see your son again .
if i don' t see more my son again , i swear to god , i' il rip your fucking head off .
i don' t intend to mock you , officer , but i' m cancer patient .
have could you possibly put me in anymore pain than i' m already in ?
just get them here now .
tag team is on the way .
they will discover from where the video comes
in one hour , maybe two .
consider that he wants to talk with him alone .
then maybe should talk with him .
well fuck that .
five minutes , old school method .
he' s not gona respond to force , you know that .
don' t underestimate my methods .
i have been working in that in case since the first day .
i have spending all the ways to get the pieces together .
maybe that' s why you don' t have a family for yourself and you don' t understand this man what' s going through .
look ...
no , no , don' t talk with me .
listen , you already lost your son sometime before because of me .
this won' t happen again .
that is bullshit .
what we' re gonna do ?
just deal with him .
buy us more time .
you can win this erik .
you can beat him .
... to find the antidote .
there are several dispersed in the house .
one of them is inside of the safe in front to you .
all you have the combination for the safe .
think hard .
the numbers are behind your mind .
they think enough .
the numbers they are behind their minds .
the clues for the order can be ...
shit .
hey , wait for a little .
where you going ?
i' m gona find an antidote and i' il get out rom here .
antidote ?
face , you were already in the joint .
you talk with owner of the chamber you know that is no antidote for that shit .
look at this .
the doors are locked .
did you hear that ?
it is wood .
plaster .
it is not a fortress .
it is a fucking house .
i am only saying let' s just take our time and come with a game plan .
well , you' il came up with a game plan ?
all right ?
now i' m going out of here .
look .
you ok ?
yes , i' m fine .
i won' t do that if i' re you !
you don' t know what behind that fucking door .
fuck .
shit .
they leave the room .
ok ?
let' s talk .
sit down eric .
i want to play a game .
the rules are simple .
what you have to do is sit here and to talk with me .
listen to me .
because for the enough time you will find your son in a safe and secure state .
we didn' t go properly introduced .
my name is john .
how you like to be called jigsaw .
no ...
they were the police and the press that created that name jigsaw .
i never ecuraged to claim that .
the jigsaw piece that i cut for my subjects was more to be a symbol that at that subject was missing something , a vital piece of the human puzzle : the survival instinct .
this is all really , really interesting , john .
right now i really want you to talk with me ...
i am talking to you .
you are not listening .
don' t forget the rules .
i am listening to you .
and all of this is the same sick fucking bullshit that come from you every two seconds in each interrogation that i ever did to all fucking people .
it is an interesting approach to placemarkus .
you didn' t suppose to convinceing me that
i' m your friend ?
to lead me in a false sense of security to confide me in you ?
it is difficult to follow the manual when you have my son , john .
the manual ?
what i' m doing to you right now ?
what would have made five years ago ?
would you have followed the manual ?
would you broken my jaw with a flashlight ?
you seem to know a lot about me .
i know you once considered a fearless policeman .
do you fell a lot much safer now , that you only seat behind the desk ?
i am feeling a lot of things right now .
but you feel alive , that' s what you fell .
and that' s what you want .
kindly ... get me a glass of water ?
i would very much appreciate this .
fuck .
well we estabiles that the macho bullshit ain' t gona open the door , .. any more suggestions ?
look who is talking .
the only door you know to open is between your legs .
shut the hell up , all right ?
you shut the hell up !
imbecile ...
the hell is ...
ok , nobody take shit from nobody .
we estabilish that .
did you find anything ?
no , nothing .
that tattoo , is joliete .
right ?
yeah , so ?
i did get restrain in there myself .
are you proud ?
and you , what is your corectional facility of your choice ?
what is your point ?
my point is , you were not like that durring the highschool , right ?
that make 3 of us that done time .
i think we should concentrate more on that tape cause that tape said , we have more in common that we know .
i said , the three of us ......
hey !
i found a door over here .
i need a flashlight .
over there .
fuck .
oh , shit !!
ei !
damm , kid .
sorry .
what the fuck is obl ?
obi , is my name .
hello obi , i want to play a game .
per years you have burnt those arround you enough lies and deceipts .
now you have a chance to redeem your soul for the games what you played for the other .
for playing one of mine .
inside of the equipment there are two antidotes for the poison that runs in your veins .
one is a present of mine for helping me to kidnap the other ones .
the second is yours to donate .
however , one of them will have a price .
remembers that : once you are in hell , only the devil can help you .
wait a minute , what' s that mean ?
to kidnap the others .
it was him that put us here .
the car ... it was ...
i knew that i knew him .
you were the last person that i saw before i wake up here .
you did this .
are you sure is him ?
it better be sure .
i am sure .
you' ve done the same .
i did what i had to be done .
i will give you a choice .
you have 5 seconds to get us out of here .
i don' t know the way out .
bullshit .
you put us in here , you get us out from here .
no , i can' t .
then you are dead .
sorry .
no , wait .
listen to me .
we got two antidotes in that oven .
we are wasting time here .
wasting time ?
are you kiddin ' me ?
he kidnapp me in the middle of the night .
we know even know what is in those syringes .
do you want to stick yourself to find out ?
yeah .
anyway , who will get them ? ...
right now , you go in there or i kill where you stay .
if you will threat me with a knife , at least to cut me a little .
i guss i' il go in there to get those needles .
if i' il get one .
one for me .
hurry up .
come on , man !
guys can pray for this one .
thank you , hommie .
here we go .
what the fuck is happening ?
open the door .
open the door .
it is locked .
open the door .
open the fucking door .
come on , get him out of there .
the door !
i will try .
i don' t get to open .
come out of there .
use your coat .
use your fucking coat .
come on .
open the door .
stop that .
come on !
stop it !
it' s a window here .
he has the antidote .
stop that .
remove him then .
stop that !!
hang on man , will get you out .
stop it , stop it ...
stop that ...
yo , fuck away .
move , move !!
shit !
the needles .
he lost the needles .
i want the fucking needles !!
calm down .
fuck ! .
the needles are fucking hot .
he had a choice .
another one down , kerry .
how much time will time lose with that bastard ?
we are not wasting time , we are doing what should do .
didn' t look like this to me !
you see , detective , the darwin theory of the evolution , the survival of the more fort , based on his little trip to galapagos is no longer applied on this planet .
we have human race to test the edge or will to survive .
what the fuck do you want ?
i' m trying to remain calm , isn' t it ?
and your son is walking arround on those monitors .
i cannot give what you want if i don' t know what the fuck it is .
you know what it is .
just remember the rules .
no , you said you want to talk .
then you said that you want to play a game .
you are talking , but it means nothing .
what is the cure for the cancer , erik ?
what ?
the cure for the cancer .
what is it ?
i don' t know what is . but i know is not to kill and to torture people for your sick fucking pleasure .
i never murdered nobody in my life .
the decision are up to them .
well , to put a gun to someone head and force him to pull the gun it is still murder .
since when the use of force solve a problem of your ?
why you' re so desperate to get your son back ?
' cause he is my son .
when was the last time when you said to him that you love him ?
well , then go !
seems to me that closing son' s death is causing you to act .
when is your willing to do that when a life is at stake ?
i always loved my son , that' s never changed .
mmm , it' s changed now .
the knowledge of the death changes everything .
if i will tell you the exact date and time of your own death , it will shut your world completely .
i know .
can you imagine what is fell like to have someone sit you down ...
john cramer ? .. and tell you that you are dying ?
the gravity of that ?
that the clock is ticking for you .
in one second , the world is crack open .
you look at things differently , you smell things differently .
you savor everything , either a glass of water or a walk in the park .
the clock is ticking , john .
most people have the luxury not knowing when that clock will go off .
and the irony of that is that keeps for really living their lives .
it keep them drinking that glass of water but not really tasting it .
you can still fix that , john .
yeah , but you can fix you ?
i' m not fixable .
i have cancer .
you think that the cancer is an excuse for what you done ?
no .
the cancer is all what started me and my work .
it was the moment i decided to end my life , and start a new with my work .
that brought meaning to it .
i literally , driving myself to suicide .
i failed .
my body is not strong enough to fight cancerous cells .
than i have lived for a plundge of ...
and for my amazement , i was alive .
and i was determined to spend the rest of my days testing the fabric of human nature .
do you understand , erik ?
you have the chance to do something right now , john .
just tell where my son is .
i will help you .
i don' t need your help , and i can tell you that you stil don' t understand .
those who don' t appreciate life , do not deserve life .
my son appreciate his life .
but do you appreciate yours ?
do appreciate your son' s ?
bullshit !
don' t forget the rules .
will help to find your son .
where are you ?
no , we don' t have 15 minutes .
we need that location to the video feed .
hey , we should stop , ok ?
ok ?
it is the second time when i wake up in this shithole .
can you stand up ?
yeah . but only if i want to .
it' s still so much things to do .
so many people have to talk to me .
this can be it .
it' s not .
amanda , you said that you survive this , right ?
do what ?
this guy .
whatever is he doing ... you said that you played before .
you survived .
yeah .
so , we can survive .
yeah .
amanda , why you defend him ?
because i was a fucking junkie .
but the funny is , i pass the little test .
if you passed the test , why you are back here ?
i was mean with myself .
how long has been ...
i started in jail .
what were arrested for ?
possesion .
but , if i said that ...
maybe you should talk with the cop who arrested me .
i guess you were never been arrested before .
no .
i' ve been in trouble few times , you know , and some other stuff .
my father is the ...
he is a real hard ass .
he probably is right now looking for me , just to kick my ass for dissapereance .
yeah , probably .
we found a door .
come on .
come on .
we have to go .
it the only one without a lock , but we can' t get it open .
how' s going ?
it' s stuck in some thing .
here , let me try it .
come on !
take it easy .
back up , allright ?
if is stuck , it' s a trap .
man , the whole house is a trap .
somebody doesn' t want us in that room .
now what ?
i will make it back , ok ?
what else will do ?
we got 3 minutes to get it done .
hello xavier , i want to play a game .
the game i want to play is very similar with what you give that played as a drug dealer .
the game of offering hope to the desperate for a price .
i think we can agree that your situation is desperate .
so i offer you hope .
the price you to pay is that you must crawl in the same pit you force yours customers into .
by entering this room , a timer has been started
when the time expired , the door in front of you will be locked forever .
guys !
you must have find the key before that the time runs out .
can you unlocked , with the dreams that are locked inside ?
i will give you just one hint that' s where the key is .
it will be as finding a needle in the heist .
let the game begin .
somebody is going there .
nobody is fucking going in there ...
no , no ...
you are sick ..
what are you doing ? !
stop , nooo !!
put her down !
help me !!
shit !
oh my god .
come on .
we don' t have time .
o , shit .
' the fuck is wrong with you ?
what are you doing ?
you are fucking mind !
hurry up .
keep going .
we don' t have time .
keep fucking looking .
come on !

somebody help her . ' the fuck , guys ?
no , no , nooooo ! ....
come on .

that' s enough .
that' s no nealry enough .
ahh , stop that bullsit .
did you hear that tape ?
he knows about us , our names .
there is something that we are not seeing .
yeah .
you said you three you been there .
make it 4 .
for what ?
does it matter ?
anybody else ?
what about you ?
you got juvenile written all over you .
no , never been .
all right .
let' s talk this out anymore .
no more talking .
the only thing you people haveing in common is holding me back .
i' m out .
where is that damm tactical team ?
will be here any second .
i' m not listening to this any more .
another second is to fucking long .
i know how this guy works , ok ?
he is playing a game .
that mean we have to stay a little bit longer .
take a look at the clock .
you need something for that box , or his son will end up in one .
his work .
he want to get done , that' s how he' s doing .
he wants to be heard , to be studied .
right , destroy his work .
how will get your conviction without all those evidence , eric ?
don' t mean a shit , big deal .
so go ahead , destroy it .
i will !
just knows will not save your son if you do it .
you kill my son , i kill you .
oh , yeah ?
we both know what sort of person you are .
that sort of person that gun down an unarmed suspect .
the sort of person who plants evidence in order to obtain a conviction .
that sort of person that is abandoned by the wife and hated by his son .
shut the fuck up !
he said he found a trace through satellite .
your tag team has arrived .
just in time .
we right now found the source of that video .
somebody haven' t told you , eric .
i tired listening to you .
maybe i can just show it to you .
unfortunately , it be difficult for me to get it myself , so you perhaps could ask the people who are listening to that walkie that he can get it for me .
brown desk .
second drawer .
you may not remember all those people .
but i am sure they remembers you .
you were the arresting officer of all they cases .
and you were the one who plant all the evidence used to obtain their convection .
you are the one who put them away .
your son is playing a game with a lot of people that don' t like you very much , detective .
it will be a shame that they discover who he was ?
you all possess the combination for the safe .
think hard .
the numbers are in the back of your mind .
the clue of the order can be found , over the rainbow .
bitch .
what are you doing ?
i haven' t decide yet .
you know , the others are scared of you .
good .
you and me ... we keep going on each other like back in the yard , or we can come together and figure out who is doing that to us .
you and others do what you want .
i already found what the fuck to do .
you remind me of me .
you don' t know what kind of fuck up situation you in , you have to find yourself a enemy .
you know want ?
i' ve got enemies .
outside these fucking walls , bro .
and they are looking for me .
and if they will not find me , they go after those close to me .
my family .
you understand ?
no , i don' t understand .
it' s just me , and that' s the way i like it .
now , turn around .
what ?
turn around .
you son ...
oh , shit .
no , we can' t stop .
we' ve been here for two hour .
if is what' s said true , then we got one hour and that front door will open .
we won' t gona make it that long .
possible winning that' s usual .
she know what is talking about .
oh , yeah ?
x mark the spot .
