basically you' re getting twice the bass ... with the tk241 , which we' ve ... got available in this system .
i don' t know .
i don' t really know if i need all that bass .
i think you need all that bass .
if you want a system to handle what you want ... you need the bass .
this is hi fi .
high fidelity .
that means this is the highest quality fidelity .
hi fi .
two important things to have in a stereo system .
it' s the price .
i have this unit in my home .
really ?
yes , i do .
but , of course , i got it modified with the tk421 .
which kicks it up another ... 3 or 4 ... quads per channel , you know ?
but that' s technical talk .
that doesn' t concern you .
you' re still a little uncertain .
you know what you need ?
a test drive .
you need a test drive .
it' s one thing to hear it from buck' s mouth .
it' s another thing to hear it from the tk421 .
let me pop in this 8 track .
listen , and tell me what you think .
hear that ?
you hear the bass .
right ?
you hear it ?
it kicks !
it turns !
it curls up your belly .
it makes you wanna freaky deaky , right ?
now if you get the system as is ... it won' t sound like this without the tk421 modification .
and we do that in the store right here .
very small price .
move with it if you need to .
it helps me .
thank you for your time .
well , so long , partner .
what the fuck was that ?
have i told you ?
have i ?
what ?
you put on a country western shit , no one' il buy a stereo .
what kind of brother listens to that shit ?
look , jerry ...
no , no , no .
you look .
i gave you a job because ...
i thought your acting stuff might bring nice pussy in .
and it has .
but i can' t have anymore fuck ups .
you dig ?
you dig ?
yeah , i dig .
now get in the back and unload those new 484' s .
all right .
sorry .
settle down , class .
this is your final .
keep your test papers facedown until i tell you to turn them up .
clear your tables , please .
there should be nothing on your desk but the test and a pencil .
we' re covering chapters 17 through 28 .
your eyes should stay on your test papers , please .
are we ready ?
class , begin .
i love to suck cock .
i love to suck cock .
honey ?
you okay ?
sweetheart ?
is something wrong ?
i got to get back .
i need it again .
i have to go to work .
come on , give it to me .
don' t make me pounce you .
i' il do it .
you promise ?
that' s it .
you want it ?
how bad ?
bad .
you sure ?
you asked for it !
god . wait .
stop !
what ?
your cock is so beautiful .
do you know how good you are doing it , eddie ?
having sex ?
fucking me ?
making love to me ?
everyone has one thing .
everyone' s given one special thing , right ?
that' s right .
everyone' s blessed with one special thing .
i want you to know i plan on being a star .
a big bring shining star .
that' s what i want .
that' s what i' m going to get .
i know .
i got to go .
you' re lucky .
you want a ride ?
you want a ride ?
i' m going really far .
do you remember me from a couple hours ago ?
yeah , i remember .
come with us , sweetie .
this is a really cool car .
what i' m trying to tell you ... is that it takes a lot ... of the good american old green stuff to make one of these things , you know ?
you' ve got your camera , you' ve got your film ...
you got your lights , your sound , your lab costs ... you got devloping , your synching , your editing .
before you turn around ... you' ve spent maybe 20 , 25 , 30 thousand dollars on a movie .
that' s a lot .
you bet your ass it is .
but if you make a good one ... there' s practically no end to how much money you can make .
have you seen jack' s house ?
he will .
he' il see it .
you got maybe 15 , 20 guys standing around just ... making sure that your lighting is right .
but you can work out in the morning , you can work out at noon , at night .
it doesn' t matter .
if you don' t have those juices flowing in the mr. torpedo area ... in the fun zone .
but you must get people in the theater .
you need the big dicks , the big tits ...
here we go .
how do you keep them in the theater after they' ve come ?
with beauty ... and with acting .
i understand you' ve got to get them in the theater ... keep the seats full .
but i don' t want to make a film ... where they sit down , jack off ... and they get up and get out before the story ends .
it is my dream , it is my goal ... it is my idea to make a film ... that the story just sucks them in ... and when they spurt out that joy juice , they just got to sit in it .
they can' t move ... until they find out how the story ends .
i want to make a film like that .
i understand they have to make films , i' ve made them myself ... that are a few laughs ... everybody fucks their brains out .
and that' s fine .
but it' s my dream ... to make a film ... that is true ... and right ... and dramatic .
you want a fresca ?
no thanks .
are you sure ?
you' re out of limes , jack .
check in the kitchen , darling .
i' m going to bed .
good night , jackie .
don' t stay up too late .
good night , beauty .
good night , eddie .

she' s a wonderful mother .
she' s a mother to all those who need love .

i' m going to fucking buy these .

it' s funny you say that because we should be in a band .
you like my shoes ?

i got them with reed and scotty .
they' re cool .
they' re embossed leather with this patchwork reptilian pattern design .
can we have some hot sauce ?

becky barnett !
raymond' s a leo .
i knew it .
what' s your sign ?
i' m a pisces .
what ?
i can' t deal with no pisces .
that shirt' s pretty sexy .
this is , like , imported italian nylon .
and it' s , like , a special edition limited silk print .
and it was done by this really famous ... design artist from italy .
pick a card .
what' s up , baby ?
i love you !
i' m going to cut the deck one time , all right ?
now i' m going to make your card rise from the deck .
damn !
2 of diamonds , right ?
that' s my card !
but doesn' t it make you nervous when you' re dealing with those evil forces ?
horses ?
what ?
no , the evil forces !
evil ?
no , man , it' s not evil .
it' s an illusion .
yeah , it' s confusing .
thank you .
we' re going to try and do this all in one shit !
so , we start like this , and then you roll her over , dirk .
roll with him , but try to give me every single position .
is that possible ?
rollergirl , if you wrap your leg around ... no , the left one .
around and over .
good .

perfect .
is the movement on the waterbed a problem ?
no , not at all , kurt , i dig it .
it' s great .
okay , can we do this ?
yeah .
all right , everybody .
here we go .
this is going to be great .
do you want me to use the spanish accent ?
jack horner has found something special in newcomer dirk diggler .
it' s another stellar sexual standout from horner and company .
digger delivers a performance worth a thousand hard ons .
his presence when dressed is powerful and demanding .
stripped to the bone ,
diggler' s more eruptive than a volcano on a bad day .
amber waves ' cherry lips do a great job of handling diggler' s wide load ...
rocking reed rothchild' s stiff biceps do a slapping good job ... job with becky barnett' s supple ass .
but it' s dirk diggler that remains the stand out in this film .
it' s easy to predict after only 2 films
diggler' s suck cess can only grow ... and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow .
what else ?
that' s it for now .
look at the character holmes came up with .
and look , i just ...
tell me .
i don' t like seeing women treated that way .
the guy who plays johnny wadd .
it' s always about slapping a girl around .
it' s not right .
it' s not cool .
it' s just not sexy .
it' s not sexy like it should be .
the guy' s more like a james bond type character .
you know , he' s classy .
he' s a world traveled guy .
i like that .
reed could play my partner .
i like that a lot .
we could make it really good , jack .
honestly , if you direct it , we make a whole series with a whole story .
it' s exactly what we' ve always talked about .
please .
when we get back ... set up the typewriter .
we' il see what comes out of it .
but i have to talk to the colonel when we get to vegas .
you must work on the colonel too , you must be committed .
right , right , jack .
i' il do whatever i have to do .
does this character have a name ?
his name is " brock landers .
and his partner' s name is " chest rockwell .
those are great names !
and the award for " best newcomer " goes to ... yes , my baby boy , dirk diggler !
and the award for " best cock " goes to ... and here we go again , dirk diggler !
the award for " best actor " goes to ...
i' ve seen all his movies and i can' t wait to work with him !
mr. dirk diggler !
i don' t know what to say .
i guess the only thing i can say is ...
i' il promise to keep rocking and rolling and making better films .
you know , it seems we makes these movies ... and sometimes they' re considered filthy or something by some people .
but i don' t think that' s true .
these movies we make , they can be better .
they can help , they really can .
i mean that !
we can always do better .
i' m going to keep trying , if you guys keep trying .
let' s keep rocking and rolling .
shot of tequila , straight up .
yes , ma' am .
i' ve been in this place for 20 minutes just to get a seat .
are you alone ?
yeah .
just visiting la .
some people told me the food in here was really good .
it' s not good .
it' s the best place to eat in all of la .
it' s excellent .
i hope so .
i could die of starvation before i get something in my mouth .
still hungry ?
starving .
why don' t you feast on that .
oh , it' s true .
what' s that ?
you are brock landers .
freeze !
don' t make me chase you , raphael !
freeze !
we' re almost there .
i want you to trim the head .
take the shot of reed with the revolver .
just dump it and switch the title card .
i want it to come flying out of the screen at the audience .
nice .
piece of cake .
that' s my guy .
i told him , this is a special party for scotty j.
i want your lightest , bubbliest champagne .
this is what he gave me .
take a sip of this and tell me what you think .
this is supposed to be really good stuff .
here , take a sip .
is that pretty light ?
yeah , that is .
what do you think ?
it' s beautiful !
look how spacious it is .
yeah , look .
i like these .
that' s custom made .
that' s real italian leather .
watch this .
what' s that ?
my initials .
that' s imaginative !
how' d you think of that ?
i was thinking of my name and dreamt it up .
i' m almost finished .
it looks great .
i used a little poetic license to capture your essence .
it looks great .
it' s a good piece for conversation .
it' s really neat .
jesse did all that oil painting as well .
buck is still installing the stereo .
that' s a bean bag !
and that lamp ... those are real sterling silver .
it' s a very interesting room .
it has a very modern feel too .
watch this .
you ready ?
can' t wait to see it .
it' s my dojo .
it' s all asian !
an asian room !
it has that whole karate feel .
it' s very comfortable .
yeah .
a lot of ancient china .
i have my statues for my best actor awards .
a good place to keep your awards .
i' m glad .
look up there .
oh , that' s handy .
can you see yourself ? .
yeah .
it' s great , huh ?
it' s my whole , entire wardrobe .
it' s all perfectly organized for me by color as well as designer .
you don' t have to think about it or anything .
you' il love it .
this is my favorite thing in the world .
close your eyes .
okay , you ready ?
yeah , baby .
isn' t it beautiful ?
oh , god .
this is it .
this is the thing .
you deserve this , baby .
isn' t it great ?
this is the most beautiful thing i' ve ever seen .
want to go for a ride ?
oh , yeah !
she rocks !
hold on !
you set us up , chico .
fuck with raphael and ringo , that' s your business .
don' t fuck with chest !
you know what ?
you' re not even worth it !
i gave you a chance !
i trusted him .
well , we almost solved the case .
at least the women are safe .
let' s go get some of that saturday night beaver .
no one fucks with chest and brock .
this is the best work we' ve ever done .
it' s a real film , jack .
it feels good .
you made it fly .
this is the film ...
i want them to remember me by .
thank you .
as far as i' m concerned , it' s all about love .
you know what i mean ?
if you love someone , how hard can the world be ?
peole will come and they will go , and so will problems , but ultimately ... if you have got love on your side , and it is just ...
i mean , it is just deep down in your soul ... what' s a problem that takes your attention away from that ?
do you understand ?
i' m becky barnett .
jerome .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too , becky .
so , what do you do ?
i' m in the auto industry .
i' m a regional manager over at pep boys .
that' s great , that' s great .
you' ve got a really nice smile , becky .
thank you ...
jerome .
the colonel .
floyd gondolli !
great you could make it .
great , great !
how are you ?
you look happy .
i' m fine .
meet boys , tommy , pete .
meet girls , cyndi , angie .
these are the next stars .
there are the real people in the world .
i think we ought to talk to jack .
iron this thing out before the new year ?
let' s do it .
but what were you thinking ?
what were you feeling ?
did you do research ?
what are you talking about here ?
oh , nothing .
want to come with me for a while ?
where ?
it' s a surprise , surprise , surprise .
yeah , let' s go .
excuse me , jessie .
hey , buck .
hey , jessie .

yes .
todd parker !
rocking reed rothchild !
you made it !
it' s an amazing party .
fucking chicks everywhere .

courtesy of jack horner , thank you .
i wouldn' t mind me having a piece of that action over there .
michelle .
i' il introduce you .
sure .
introduce her to my lap .
did you get off work ?
don' t dance sunday nights .
who' s vette is that in the driveway ?
dirk .
i' m jealous of him .
that shit' s jamming .
start down low with a 350 cube .
3 1/ 4 horsepower , 4 speed , 4 10 gears ... 10 coats of orange , hand rubbed lacquer with a dual plane manifold .
full fucking race cams .
i' m pretty happy with it , you know ?
it' s a great look for you , i think .
it' s pretty original , you know , i think .
take this off .
what were we talking about before ?
oil painting ?
no .
no , yes !
i mean , but i was saying that ...
sunsets !
right , yeah .
i was saying that i love sunsets .
but sunrises are better .
exactly .
i thought i was the only one who felt that way .
no , i feel that way .
really ?
yes really .
have you heard my stereo system ?
no .
i' m going to open my own business .
really ?
yes .
it' s my dream , okay ?
it' s hi fi stereo equipment at discount prices .
it' s called " buck' s super stereo world .
that is a fucking great idea .
you know , in the 80' s that' s when it' s going to happen .
for real .
really ?
yes , really .
in the 80' s .
i wanted you to come in so i could tell you how much i love you .
it' il be a new year and we' re going to start things , and do things ... and i just wanted you to know how much i care about you .
i really care about you , honey .
you' re my little baby .
you' re the best thing that' s happened to me since my son went off .
i love you , honey .
i love you , too .
fucking 1980 , you know ?
can you believe it ?
i can' t .
the next thing you know it' s going to be ...
like , 1990 , and 2000 .
can you imagine ?
good bye 1979 ...
hello 1980 .
make sure you snort it back real quick and hard .
like this .
it burns .
it' s good though , right ?
it' s going in my throat .
that' s the drip .
the drip' s the best part .
it tastes like aspirin .
do one more in the other nostril .
i need a drink of water .
one more and then a drink of water .
do you think i look cool when i do it ?
so let' s talk about the future .
let' s talk about what video means to this industry .
let' s talk about how all of us , not one of us , how all of us will profit .
now , i' ve been doing theater in san francisco and san diego ...
as long as you' ve been doing stag and hardcore .
we' re all familiar with your biography , floyd .
no one is doubting your credentials or your history .
then why the resistance ?
this industry will be turned upside down soon enough .
why help it ?
why not be prepared ?
colonel' s got money .
you got talent .
i got the equipment and distribution .
not to mention those kids out there ... who are hot fuck action to the max , jack .
this is the future .
videotape tells the truth .
you come into my house , my party , to tell me about the future ?
and the future is tape , videotape , and not film ?
that it' s amateurs , not professionals ?
i' m a filmmaker .
that' s why i' il never make a movie on videotape .
i' il tell you something .
i will never loan out any of the actors under contract to me .
period .
wait a minute , jack .
i' m not a complicated man .
i like cinema .
in particular , i like to see people fucking on film .
but i don' t want to win an oscar or re invent the wheel .
i like simple pleasures like butter in my ass and lollipops in my mouth .
that' s something i enjoy .
call me crazy , call me a pervert .
but there is one thing that i want to do in this life .
and that is , i want to make a dollar and a cent in this business .
i' m not trying to hurt you .
i' m trying to help you stay ahead of the game .
we' re going in circles now .
we' re in familiar territory .
the territory we' re in is the future .
not to mention the cost .
you know , if it looks like shit , and it sounds like shit , then it must be shit !
you' re holding on too tight , jack .
it doesn' t have to look good .
film is just too damn expensive .
and theaters are already converting to video projectors .
i haven' t heard that .
well , it' s true .
ten minutes before the new year .
i' d like to spend it with my friends .
we will or will not continue this conversation .
hey , scotty .
what' s up ?
fucking new year' s , right ?
1980 .
oh , man !
right !
did you see my new car ?
got a new car ?
want to see ?
all right .
cool .
it' s out front .
come on .
i want you to meet my friend todd .
todd parker , dirk diggler .
what' s up , man ?
how are you ?
we finally meet .
i was telling you about him before .
you remember ?
todd parker ?
he works at party boys strip club ?
cool .
you' re a dancer .
yeah , i got some moves .
you coming or you want to talk to these guys ?
i' il be around in a little bit and we can talk then , okay ?
see you later , reed .
when you get my the lights , close your eyes .
just follow my voice .
here , here , here , here , here .
it' s cool !
you want to get inside ?
when did you get it ?
yesterday .
i had it painted yesterday , so the paint might be kind of sticky .
this is great , man !
you want to go for a ride ?
wait , wait !
fuck !
hell , how much time is left ?
i' m sorry .
what the hell is the matter with you ?
why did you do that , scotty ?
you look at me sometimes .
i want to know if you like me .
yeah , i like you , scotty .
can i kiss you ?
please , can i kiss you on the mouth ?
please let me ?
look , i' m really sorry .
i didn' t mean to grab you like that or scare you .
do you want to kiss me ?
what' s the matter with you ?
forget it .
i' m really drunk .
really , i am .
i' m out of my head .
i' m really wasted .
really , dirk .
i' m really just wasted .
i' m crazy right now .
i' m really crazy .
do you want to go back inside ?
do you like my car , dirk ?
what ?
because i wanted to , you know ...
i wanted to make sure you thought it was cool or else i' d take it back .
it' s great .
happy new year .
happy new year , scotty .
i really love you .
i love you too , scotty .
let' s go back inside , okay ?
idiot !
i' m a fucking idiot .
i' m a fucking idiot .
two minutes , pops !
let' s go !
let' s go !
two minutes !
come on , little bill !
little bill , smile , man !
little bill , champagne ?
thanks .
that' s nice of you .
happy new year .
to you too .
kurt , have you seen my wife ?
they' re doing the countdown thing .
come on in , man .
hey , little bill , look at me .
10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6, 5, 4 ... 3 ... 2 ...
what the fuck was that ?
where' s jack ?
what about your character , " brock landers " ?
and what people may consider violent attitudes towards women ?
violence ?
no !
i mean , if there' s a certain amount of ... violence or action in this series of film , that' s the movie .
if brock landers is slick with a gun ... he does so in the vein of good .
brock protects the values of the american ideal , and fights for causes that instill pride in a society where morals are hard to come by .
who sent you ?
get the fuck off me , asshole .
lie still or i' il punch you in the face !
fuck off ! .
i' il find out who sent you .
amber , i live in this world .
i don' t like violence any more than you do .
violence is a bad thing .
but when you see violence in films ...
if movies , films , caused violence ... we' d be able to wipe out violence tomorrow .
no more films .
that' s fine .
i' il do something else .
i' il fuck on my own time .
you know , i got other interests .
i' m a magician .
hopefully , that will be something ...
i focus on in the future .
you can' t fuck forever .
i realize that .
violence ... is something that plagues us as a society .
well , the fine line is , i' m playing a character .
i mean , i' m dirk diggler .
brock landers is a character that i' m playing .
i' il ask you again , and i' il ask nice .
where the fuck is ringo , you bitch ?
fuck you .
why do i love him ?
he' s very special .
he can fuck hard or he can fuck really gently .
he' s the best .
i think that' s ... part of my reason for doing this .
i' ve gotten thousands upon thousands of letters ... from people telling me , " god , you' ve taught me this and ... you' ve made our love life so much better .
this isn' t " go out and have sex with ten million people .
how to get a girl off . " it' s how to get your wife off .
if only people could have been doing this before , we could have saved a million relationships .
i' ve saved thousands .
blocking an idea or movement .
jack' il put the final touches together for what the camera needs for editing .
but he allows me to block my own sex scenes and gives me the freedom to develop the character and stuff like that .
i don' t know any other director who would let an actor ... do that .
i don' t allow him to block his own sex scenes .
it is .
it' s jealousy ... it' s deceitfulness , it' s vindictiveness .
but , god , what can you expect when you' re on top .
it' s like napoleon , when he was the king ... people were constantly trying to conquer him ... in the roman empire .
it' s history repeating itself all over again .
to all the critics out there , i know they' il be reviewing this .
i know they' il try to knock me .
i want them to know can i say this into the camera ?
sure .
i only am who i am because i was born that way .
i have a gift ... and i am trying to not be selfish about it , but to use it .
and if you want to knock me for that , it' s your own problem .
jealousy will get you nowhere .
i' m going to keep rocking on .
for dirk diggler , the future is something to look forward to , not to fear .
film , poetry , karate , music and dance .
he is a man of passion and mystery .
he is a man of lust .
it' s my poem to you .
it' s really good .
you' re like a director now .
have you shown jack yet ?
no .
i wanted you to be the first .
it' s really good , amber .
congratulations .
thanks , baby .
you might want to think about cutting the part where jack talks about ...
about blocking the sex ?
that stuff about me not being a black belt is not true .
yeah , i can fix that .
how' d it turn out ?
what ?
slow down .
guys , guys , guys !
slow down , colonel .
say again ?
i' il be right there ...
so ... ?
let me tell you , jack .
i don' t mean to laugh about it , but she was ... 15 going on 150 .
believe me .
i mean , she was ... you would never know it .
never know .
i was fooled completely .
i mean , i' ve had a few of them .
anyhow ...
you do believe me , don' t you ?
yeah , i believe you .
anyway , so i take her home ... and i got her there and ...
i tell her not to do so much coke .
she must' ve done 20 lines in 5 minutes !
it' s like a vacuum in her nose .
just going up like crazy .
anyway , she' s got all this stuff going on .
next thing you know , she stopped .
something must have broken up there because blood poured everywhere .
pouring out .
you thought she was older ...
you didn' t do anything ...
she was just at the ...
she was at your place .
you didn' t do anything , right ?
right .
nothing .
you didn' t do anything ?
not a thing .
you know me , jack .
you didn' t do anything ?
no , i didn' t do anything .
but they ... foud something at the house .
what ?
there' s something that' s ...
jack , it' s my fucking weakness .
they' re so small and they' re so cute , and they' re so adorable .
i just can' t help it when they' re so cute and adorable .
jack , listen .
i don' t touch them , jack .
not in any way .
honestly .
jack , please !
now you think i' m an asshole .
jack , let me tell you this .
i love you , jack .
i' m your friend .
there' s one thing i want you to do , though .
jack , come on .
tell me that you' d be my friend .
just tell me , am i your friend ?
jack , am i your friend ?
i do .
i do too .
i now pronounce you man and wife .
i' m dying to do a movie with you .
i know you are .
it' s such an important thing in my life .
i spoke to jack .
you know , i spoke to him , but ...
i tell you what comes to my mind .
what comes to mind is , i am the ultimate latin lover .
there' s no latin lover like me .
once you get maurice as the latin lover ...
that' s so great , you guys !
it' s a chance for me to run the store my way .
get them off my back .
we' re getting a house .
exactly !
i' m going to run the store my way .

so , i can tell you it' s a tough business .
you got a great kisser .
there' s a lot of work involved .
a lot of people .
we all have to work our buns off .

i mean , it takes 15 , 16 guys just to ... do the lighting .

shut up , man .
hey , you guys .
what ?
just saying , " hey .
yeah , whatever .
you all right ?
it' s getting me fucking high .
it' s that carpet dope .
it' s the kind of dope they used to put carpet in .
they' d mix it up in the bathtub .
while they' re mixing it they' d drop in a hunk of carpet into it .
it' s a lot better than that pink shit .
that pink shit' s weird .
they put fish scales in that shit .

you' re nobody' s fool .
you' re at your best when the going gets rough .
you' ve been put to the test but it' s never enough .
you got the touch .

no , not really .
maybe .
it sounds balanced to me .
it' s taking away from my vocal .
take the bass down and bring up the vocal .
let' s do it , nick .

yeah , let' s try it .
i think we should repeat that again .
it' s definitely cool .

i was going to take a pottery class at everywoman' s village ..
i want to do that .
we' il do that .
mondays , wednesdays , and fridays at three .
i was thinking something .
i was going to see about taking the ged .
do you know what that is ?
for high school .
to graduate .
i never got my diploma .
i feel bed .
i think you were right about that .
you should do it , rollergirl .
because you know what ?
if you wanted to , you could do anything .
have your loan application ?
yes , i do .
good .
do you want to follow me ?
are we going to have any other coverage on this ?
we just keep shooting .
this is video .
we shoot and shoot , then we deal with it later .
now , summer , i want you to take sky' s thong off .
that thong thing .
yeah , actually take it off .
and finger it .
no , that' s good .

that' s really good technically ... but it lacks passion .
i want to see some passion here .

who' s your daddy , bitch ?
you' il live .
i' m back !

because people want to know what they' re getting into technically .
i have the hi fi background to answer any technical question they have .
i' ve been in sound equipment long enough ... to know what a guy wants when he walks in .
that' s the personal touch that
buck' s super stereo world will have .
i miss my two sons , you know ?
i miss my little andrew ... and my dirk .

hold on .
now , look .
come on .
all right ?
all we need is the tapes , burt .
no , you don' t get them until you pay .
in our situation that doesn' t make any fucking sense !
we can' t pay the price of the demo tapes unless we take the demo tapes to the record company and get paid !
exactly !
that' s not an m. p. , that' s a y. p. your problem !
come up with the money and i' il give you the tapes .
you' re talking above my head .
i don' t know this industry jargon .
y. p. , m. p. , whatever .
okay ?
all i know is that i cannot get a record contract .
we cannot get a contract ... unless i take these tapes .
and granted , the tapes themselves are yours .
you own them , okay ?
but the magic that is on the tapes ... that heart and soul we put into those tapes , that is ours .
and you don' t own that .
now , i need to take that magic and get it to the record company !
they' re waiting .
we were supposed to be there half an hour ago .
we look like assholes right now , man !
i don' t want to do this anymore .
i can' t .
let' s have fun now .
let' s just go and go .
because it' s over .
there' s too many things .
too many things .
too many things .
let' s go walk .
i don' t want to leave this room .
me either !
i love you , honey .
i love you , mom .
let me explain to him ... in simple arithmetic .
one , two , three .
because you don' t fucking get it , burt !
you give us the tapes , we get the record contract ... we come and give you your money .
have you heard the tapes ?
we' re guaranteed a record deal .
our stuff is that good .
we sculptured .
now , i understand .
i know you want it to happen .
but it' s not going to happen .
because it' s a " catch 22 " and that' s it .
what does that mean ?
what is a " catch 22 " ?
catch 22 , " gentlemen .
think about it .
you know what i' m thinking about ?
i' m thinking about kicking some fucking ass in here , man !
scotty , get him out of here !
thanks a lot of backing us up too .
real good .
fuck !
we can' t help you .
i have all the papers , though .
i mean ... everything' s in order ?
yes ?
yes .
but we can' t give you a loan .
i' m sorry .
i don' t understand .
why can' t you give me the loan ?
mr. swope , you' re a pornographer .
the banks is not in business to support pornography .
i' m not a pornographer , though .
i' m an actor .
i' m sorry .
look , this is a new business for me .
all right ?
it' s a real thing that i want to do .
it' s a real thing that i can do .
please !
i' m sorry .
we did everything right .
it' s okay .
just wait a minute .
let' s just take a minute , okay ?
look , you have something to say .
i have something to say .
all right ?
so let' s just talk .
if there is something that i didn' t fill out correctly on this ... or something that i left out , or that you want me to write on there just tell me what to write on there .
i' m sorry .
you' re not being fair !
this isn' t fair .
this financial institution cannot endorse pornography .
stop saying that !
quit saying " pornography " !
why are you doing this ?
i' m an actor !
i' m sorry .
i am an actor !
who' s your daddy ?
how is it ?
what it is , what it is .
suck that cock , bitch .
so , you must be maggie ?
kathleen o' malley .
i' m the judge .
you have a lawyer with you ?
no , i don' t .
hello , judge .
good morning , counselor .
you' ve been divorced for 6 years ?
since 1977 .
and the agreement on the money settlement has been taken care of ? .
yes .
what we' re talking about , then , is coming to an agreement on the custody ... of andrew .
what was decided on during the divorce ?
well , initially , andrew was to go with his father ... for visitation , with his mother ... from saturday noon to sunday at seven .
with his mother entitled to bring andrew to her house ... or any reasonable place .
was that the understanding ?
why wasn' t that visiting privilege honored , then ?
it was .
for a while .
i only saw him twice .
it said , " reasonable place .
i don' t think that a house of drugs , prostitution and pornography was that .
i' m sorry ?
my wife is in the pornography business .
i didn' t think that environment was safe for my son .
no , this is not right .
my son was never exposed to pornographic material , drugs or any of those things .
my husband just assumed ...
i saw it with my own eye , maggie .
did you register a complaint ?
my client didn' t officially register , your honor .
but i think the circumstances call for immediate action ... for the safety of the child .
the problem judge , is that my ex wife ...
she' s a sick person , and she needs help .
she deals in sex and drugs for a living .
no , i don' t do drugs .
your honor , she has been in and out of trouble with the law ... on several occasions for this sort of thing .
no , not anymore .
no .
have you ever been arrested ?
yes .
when was the last time you were arrested ... and what was the charge ?
okay , let' s get ready for this experiment .
