janni , jimmy , get in here now !
i' m so tired of all the fighting .
you have no idea !
he hit me first .
he hit me first .
liar !
i don' t care who started it .
it has to stop .
i need you two to get along .
you understand that one day ... ... you will inherit my empire , yes ?
what' s an empire ?
shut up .
this will remind you that you are two halves of one .
together , you are more powerful than apart .
yes ?
what does this mean ?
one day , you will find out .
hey , seor .
freeze !
hi , honey .
just vacuumed this rug , okay ?
i got it all even .
take your shoes off , please .
you know the rule .
now , please , try not to scare blanche .
don' t clunk .
you' re scaring her !
look , you scared blanche now , jill .
jill !
be done in a minute .
don' t go in .
there' s a surprise in there !
don' t look .
okay .
finished it up today .
it' s all our favorite hit men .
all our favorite hits .
now , i don' t think you ever met tony " the tooth . " capped him in chicago .
i even got the hole in his head where i whacked him with a 9 iron .
santo " three fingers . " remember the rat that wouldn' t shut up ?
and , of course , frankie figs .
who could forget frankie figs ?
oh , wow , jimmy , you shot me .
poor frankie .
jimmy .
what ?
we need to talk .
i mean , i ...
i just wanted everything to be perfect for when the baby came .
that' s all .
that' s what we need to talk about .
so how did the hit go ?
good .
really ?
so you let him get away .
no !
then he' s dead ?
yeah .
then what is it ?
i didn' t kill him .
but he is dead .
at first , everything went smooth .
i did everything you said .
i had the taxi , i had the flowers .
nobody even notices me .
i could have been invisible .
you have a problem getting in ?
oh , honey , i finally used my lock pick set !
like this , i was in there and i' m waiting and i' m poised ... ... i' m cool as a cucumber .
all of a sudden , the frigging guy' s phone rings .
you flinched .
i whip my gun around ...
you flinched ! ... and i knock over his tomato sauce .
you must stay focused when you are killing a person !
then i' ve got this whole big mess .
the more i try to clean up , the worse it gets .
tomato sauce is a tough stain to get out .
you need a good grease cutter .
then finally , i hear the guy' s key in the lock .
your shotgun' s out of reach .
so now i gotta think fast .
so i go for my gun ... ... he slides across the floor and , well ...
i would go into detail , but let' s just say ... ... he left the building .
i gotta say , if the guy' s dead , we gotta put this in the win column .
same thing with spiegelman .
he fell down an elevator shaft .
but you were running right behind him just before he fell .
but i just wanna shoot someone !
all right , now .
all right , now , baby .
murdering another human being can be a very moving experience .
listen .
i got an idea .
what do you say we go and kill somebody , just us ?
we' il find some drunk tourist , take him to the beach and put three in his coconut .
what' s your favorite gun ?
a. 45 .
great .
we' il make a big mess .
how does that sound , baby doll ?
my roast .
this isn' t working .
oven' s working fine , jill .
no , this , this , jimmy .
i married a contract killer , not martha stewart .
hey , i am in disguise , okay ?
yeah , well , your disguise is dumb .
i mean , look at yourself .
and what are you doing in disguise ?
everyone thinks you' re dead .
well , you never can tell , can you ?
you are gonna sit and enjoy this meal .
i got this recipe from mrs. sanchez next door .
this is a cilantro reduction .
hey , watch your fingerprints !
i spent the whole morning scrubbing .
there is something wrong with you .
hey , there is nothing wrong with me .
there is nothing wrong with me .
every man that has an ongoing sexual relationship ... ... experiences certain peaks and valleys within his male libido from time to time .
last time we saw a peak was almost a year ago , mr. jimmy " the tulip " tudeski .
we' re in a valley .
we' re below sea level .
we' re under the water .
jimmy the tulip is alive and well .
i' m not so sure .
i saw a doctor in l. a.
this is a cilantro reduction .
you marinate the meat in tequila for 2 1 / 2 hours ... ... and it melts ...
are you listening ?
he said it wasn' t me .
jill , please just come eat .

we' re not building a fricking moat in our yard .
this will go all around the perimeter .
oz , no .
don' t ruin this moment .
i' m not ...
we' re having a baby .
not now .
i mean , we' re fighting now ... ... but then we' re gonna have a baby .
honey , i' m just trying to ...
drive me insane .
look , i don' t wanna raise a child in an environment of complete and total fear .
fear ?
who' s talking about fear ?
we' re talking about a moat .
just think of it as a little , round swimming pool .
you' re afraid of everything , oz .
that is so not true .
thinking about me ?
off and on .
yeah .
see the paper ?
well ?
i' m a little nervous about this .
there' s nothing to be nervous about .
what , is he driving you nuts again ?
yes .
sounds like you could use a break .
a little ...
cahooting ?
i seem to remember ... ... you were always good at cahooting .
i remember a time when your middle name was danger .
oh , jimmy .
cynthia .
i hate lying to oz like this .
oz can' t know anything about this .
are we clear ?
we' re clear .

your wife ... ... is in a safe ...
my wife' s in a safe ?
place .
safe place .
let me finish a sentence .
i talk , you talk , i talk .
that' s how we should have a conversation .
okay , yes , good .
whatever you say .
how safe and for how long is entirely up to you .
would it be out of line if i asked at this juncture ... ... who you are and what you' re doing in my home ?
i' m ... ... flabbergasted .
i' m sorry ...
chagrined .
that you don' t see the similarity in the facial structure .
and you guys just understand all of this ?
do you remember janni gogolak ?
do you or don' t you ?
what ?
remember janni !
yes , i remember janni .
janni ...

i think i do .
you' re like the amazing kreskin .
well , you know all this , where it' s going ?
no , no , no , no .

who is this ?
jimmy .
jimmy , hi , it' s oz .
oz ?
how the hell did oz get our number ?
i don' t know .
what did i tell you about ever calling here ?
i think you said something about killing me ...
yes , killing me and beating me to death with my own corpse .
that' s what it was .
yeah , good memory .
what do you want ?
i' m in mexico .
you' re in mexico ?
i was thinking i would swing by ...
if you come by this house , oz ... ... if you come within 25 miles , i will back a car over your head 75 times .
okay .
hi , i' m a dead man .
good talking to you .
no , no , no .
no , no , no .
stay away from the vehicle .
get out of the car .

jimmy !
jimmy , don' t shoot , it' s me , it' s oz !
i know .

oh , my god .
oh , no .
blanche !
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
blanche !
who' s blanche ?
consuelo !
xerxes !
alert the others , there' s been a tragedy !
who' s blanche ?
this is blanche .
you killed her .
i' m sorry .
go home , oz .
go home before something bad happens .
something bad already has happened .
cynthia' s been kidnapped .
poor blanche .
cut down in her prime .
he names his chickens .
you name your chickens ?
blanche !
you' re dead !
hey , oz , you' re here .
he killed blanche .
what are you doing here ?
i' d like to know .
what are you doing here ?
put a sock in it .
we talk all the time .
jill .
really .
you talk all the time ?
we spoke once .
and i think it was mostly about some kind of fruit .
are you alone ?
yeah .
you weren' t followed ?
no .
how would you know ?
honey .
well , now that he' s here , he' s staying for lobster la tudeski .
lobster la tudeski " ?
i can' t stay for lobster la tudeski .
lazlo gogolak was at my house .
oh , my god .
am i setting a place or not ?
yes , please .
what is the matter with him ?
it' s a long story .
talk to me .
well , cynthia' s been kidnapped .
are you serious ?
yes .
lazlo wants jimmy' s head for killing janni .
he came to your house ?
wouldn' t this conversation be so much better dining on my masterpiece ?
what' s wrong with him ?
are you crazy ?
are you out of your mind ?
they know you' re alive .
how would they know ?
they do .
oh , look , honey , we have a squealer in the house .
a squealer ?
i' m not a squealer !
i' ve never squealed on anybody .
how do they know , oz ?
they have cynthia .
i need your help .
yeah .
and i' m your friend .
you know what , oz ?
friendship is overrated .
i got enough friends .
in fact , i' m thinking about maybe losing a couple .
this could be great .
a way to get back in the game .
yes , back in the game .
i don' t wish to get back in the game .
i like cooking .
i like cleaning .
and i like to decorate .
we' re talking about cynthia here .
yes , cynthia .
your ex wife ?
ex " would be the key word in that sentence , oz .
if you don' t get off your ass and help get cynthia ... ... i' il never talk to you again .
if you ever grab me like that again , i will stick a knife in your face .
is that clear ?
we' il talk about it over dinner ... ... which is probably ruined .
go wash your hands .
we eat in 1 5 minutes .
he' s kidding .
you better go wash your hands , oz .
well , it really is a nice presentation .
it would have been , if we hadn' t let the sauce clot .
the potatoes were supposed to be floating around the lobster , not just stuck like that .
i had this tricolore thing going on .
it looks great .
i would hate to think you were placating me to talk about cynthia .
no .
no .
is that hebrew ?
yeah .
aren' t you catholic ?
yeah .
devout .
that makes sense .
oz ... ... give us the lowdown on cynthia .
she' s pregnant .
oh , my god !
that' s so great !
thanks .
the funny thing is , we weren' t trying .
oh , my god , that' s great .
any idea where they' re keeping her ?
with lazlo .
what' s the matter with him ?
nothing , don' t worry .
this is just his way of expressing joy lately .
oh , so this is how a retired mass murderer acts .
this is how a retired mass murderer behaves when people show up uninvited for dinner !
noted .
jimmy .
how many goons does he have with him ?
seven , eight .
and his son .
strabonitz ?
well , should i go to the police ?
kidnapping would put him away forever .
he' d make her disappear to avoid going back to the slammer .
why are you asking me ?
this is oz' s problem .
jimmy .
you have to help me .
what , are you nuts ?
i got a great thing going on down here , oz .
plus , i' m safe down here .
besides , i don' t care what happens with you and cynthia .
i' m not uprooting my life to save your sorry ass .
light it up like a piata !
you told them where i live ?
you' re dead .
told them where i live .
you' re a dead man .
jimmy , are you coming or not ? !
you can run , but you can' t hide !
let' s go !
oz !
oz .
put the ...
let' s go !
you better run , tooth boy .
i get a second , i' m gonna slice you up .
anyone hit anything yet ?
let' s go .
will you come on ?
this idiot .
will you come on ?
get up !
go !
they' re getting away !
come on !
you' re shooting at the house , they' re in the car .
you had one shot .
all right , it was a nice shot .
it was .
come here .
it was a nice shot .
nice shooting , honey .
thanks , honey .
the sons of batches got away .
so do i clip her or not ?
keep cynthia happy for the time being .
can you do that ?
not likely .
sick bastards !
what ? !
what is it ?
what ?
janni .
i want him dead .
dead !
yesterday !
before breakfast !
before eggs !
scrambled .
i don' t understand why we have to dump my car .
it' s not your business to understand .
it' s not my business to leave my $80, 000 car in mexico .
maybe you got a plan there .
take the car , lose the wife .
good plan .
i' il get the tickets .
you do that , you squealer .
i didn' t squeal on anybody .
the gogolaks showed up on their own ?
forget it , jill .
it means he' s a rat and a liar .
you married someone in the witness protection program .
you got a really funny way ... ... of asking for help , squeal cheese !
please help me ?
well , that' s a little better .
but it still doesn' t help , now that the bad guys know where i live .
you' re spitting in my mouth .
just go and get the tickets , squeal weasel !
how was that ?
it was good .
scary .
really ?
come here .
so , oz , congratulations on cynthia being pregnant .
thank you .
you think i' d be a good father ?
you don' t think i' d be a good father ?
i didn' t say that .
you didn' t say anything .
no , i think you' d be a good father .
i didn' t understand what you were ...
shut up .
why are we on this bus ?
your car' s got a gps system on it .
i figure that' s how lazlo tracked you down .
that' s what i' m hoping , for your sake .
for my sake ?
yeah .
because if that' s not the case ... ... i' m gonna kill you .
right , baby ?
yes , sirree , bob .
i wish cynthia got kidnapped more often .
me too .
i' il just put my wife in danger whenever you guys have problems in the bedroom .
what problems ?
what problems ?
i didn' t say anything .
is this what you two talk about on the phone behind my back ?
how would you like it if i talked to cynthia behind your back ?
sit down .
you' re causing a scene .
you grabbed my face .
the front part of my head .
yes ?
he bought three one way tickets to l. a.
los angeles ?
interesting .
all right , so we cut them off at the piss .
just like john wayne , we ride up over the hill .
you two in the porsche .
all right ?
when we get to l. a. , we strip it , make a few dollars and then torch it .
but for now , you hot wire it and follow us .
all right ?
come on .
can we stop the horseplay for one second ?
i' m sorry , i' m sorry .
okay , so we had a car .
my car .
my $80, 000 car .
then we' re on a bus .
and now we' re renting a car .
this doesn' t make any sense .
it will .
i ordered ... ... a black cup of coffee , all right ?
a black cup of coffee .
i screwed up .
i apologize .
well , do i have to wait another 20 minutes for your screwup ?
a black cup of coffee .
i' il get a fresh cup .
you' re still standing there .
you' re still standing .
i apologize .
bye .
hey , pal ?
why don' t you give the girl a break .
she already said she was sorry .
she' s just working for a living .
right .
why don' t you mind your own business .
asshole .
oh , no .
where was i ?
i was just gonna remind you ...
now , son , you' re never gonna be as mean or rude ... ... to a waitress or anybody that brings you food like your dad just was , are you , son ?
no .
real good .
eat all your corn .
grow up to be big and strong like your uncle jimmy .
you see , oz ?
i' d be a great father .
i just taught that kid not to be mean to waitresses .
you know , we could make this a real party .
what , we need more balloons ?
oh , strabo .
i love your name .
no , strabo , i mean , you and me ... ... well , we could make this , you know ... ... a fun party .
oh , you mean you and me ...
that' s right .
i' ve always had a little crush on you .
i' ve always sensed that .
you did ?
yes .
i guess jimmy just moved a little quicker ?
well , jimmy is as good as ...
and so you and the dentist ...
things not so well going ?
to tell you the truth ... ... i kind of miss the excitement .
and i like your hair that way .
long .
you' re making me blush .
that' s good .
give me one good reason to trust you .
well , i can give 280 million .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
your father never told you ?
what ?
what' s so funny ?
what' s so goddamn funny ?
strabo .
your daddy thinks you' re a moron .
anya !
coming .
anya , you watch the broad .
where you going ?
i' m going to the bus station .
find papa .
my god .
anya , can i use your bathroom ?
yes .
all right , i got your cream cheese and scrambled egg .
that leaves you with the tuna .
i don' t like tuna .
start liking it .
okay .
i thought of a reason why you don' t have to kill me .
what would that be , dentist ?
what if they didn' t trace me through my car ?
that' s a hell of a thing to hang my life on .
only thing to hang your life on is trust .
you want mustard ?
yes , honey , thank you .
what , no jewish prayer before our ham and cheese ?
you got a problem with my religiosity , oz ?
do unto others before you' re turned into a pillar of salt .
exactly .
unless they' re a rat .
then you can shoot them in the eyes .
a pillar of salt ?
that' s right .
moses said that .
read the bible , oz .
eat up , dentist .
it could be your last meal .
if they don' t show up , you' re gonna shoot me ?
is that it ?
that' s the size of it .
and let cynthia die too ?
i told you before , i don' t care what happens to cynthia .
oh , yeah , sure .
that' s why you' re still wearing her crucifix around your neck .
no , wait .
i' m sorry , what ?
what did you say was cynthia' s ?
did i say something ?
two years we' ve been together and you never mention ... ... you wear a present from your ex wife ?
it wasn' t a present .
where' s it from ?
i don' t know .
it' s cynthia' s .
her grandmother gave it to her and she gave it to jimmy .
you say you' re not a squealer ? !
looks like you got a reprieve , oz .
oh , thank god the killers are here .
so check the bus ?
as opposed to ... ... just looking at the bus ?
yes , check the bus !
let me out of here .
hey !
let me out of here .
come on .
open the door .
perfect .
right on time .
your wife' s as good as home , oz .
i know you' re in here .
looking for me , strabo ?
oh , shit .
anything tricky , i blow your ribs across the parking lot .
let' s go .
the rat' s not here .
not here .
the jimmy ... ... is watching me right now .
i can feel it .
hey , lazlo .
no , no , no .
look what i got .
i' m sorry , papa .
man , did you get old .
i like the whole liberace thing , though .
how long you think you can hide from me ?
where are you going with this ?
i' il call you to tell you where we' il make the exchange with cynthia .
any of your knuckleheads follow this car , i start throwing out body parts .
feet first .
you harm ... ... one hair on his head ...
if they have strabo , who has girl ?
answer .
answer , mother .
you okay , darling ?
what' s up , jill ?
nothing .
open the trunk .
don' t even think about it .
thank you .
i think you nicked his head there .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t see you .
what is your problem , jill ?
nothing .
i don' t have a problem .
good .
why don' t you go and check us in .
okay .
i wouldn' t mind you wearing it , it' s just so ugly .
just throw it away .
i can' t .
you still have feelings for her ?
it' s sacrilegious .
why not give it back to her ?
i haven' t seen her since my nickel in joliet !
where does he get sayings like that ?
we aren' t gonna talk much , are we ?
there is something really wrong with you , jill .
you' re still in love with her .
that' s insane .
isn' t it ?
why don' t you let me take it ...
jimmy , jimmy .
i love you , jill .
but if you touch this crucifix , i' il kill you .
that' s a promise .
this is my good luck charm .
i take it off , i' m jinxed .
wanna see me dead , jill ?
do you ?
sometimes , yeah .
i' m going to check in .
can you believe this ?
well , 47 percent of couples at some point ...
you know , you' ve got a very long face .
like a goldfish ... ... or a shetland pony or something .
bring strabo , oz .
i gotta have you ...
where is she ?
look , how nice .
everybody is still here ... ... having a little repast .
isn' t that lovely ?
where else would i be ?
i don' t know .
one would venture a guess .
where have you been ?
big loft , very drafty .
i understand .
get me figueroa on the phone !
mr. g. , frankie figs is dead .
how sad for him .
try calling the one who' s still alive !
jill .
come on , open the door .
jill !
jill , will you come on ?
be sensible .
apologize .
jill , honey , i' m sorry i pointed a gun at your face ... ... and said i was gonna blow your brains out .
okay ?
i didn' t mean that .
come on , knock it off .
i will when you get rid of that crucifix .
this cross represents my lord and savior .
the baby in the manger .
i throw it away ... ... i go to hell !
coming from a man who' s killed 21 people .
twenty one ?
that' s impressive .
it is , isn' t it ?
two years , i' ve been begging you to go back to work .
cynthia gets kidnapped ... ... you' re off to the races !
off to the races ?
apologize , then she' il come right out .
squeal bag !
squealster !
remington squeal !
see what you got me into ?
get over here and you help me out of this jam .
you better make it good .
snoodster ?
hon ?
you' re gonna be hearing from somebody else now .
jill ?
scooster ?
snoodster .
i think you' re being a little unreasonable .
when he pulled a gun on you ... ... that was pretty funny .
oz , nobody' s talking to you .
hey , you take it easy on oz , okay ?
he' s a doctor .
people see him when they have problems .
people see him when they have plaque .
he' s a wonderful dentist .
pipe it , toughie .
i promise i' il shoot you .
frankly , i don' t care whether we get cynthia back or not .
well , that' s a bad ...
oh , trouble in the bedroom ?
what' d you just say ?
nothing .
excuse me , please .
did you tell him that ? !
did you tell him that , jill ? !
a few moments of erectile dysfunction ...
just a few , really .
and i' m not a man now ?
is that it ?
stop kicking .
if you didn' t love her , you' d take it off .
is that it ? !
excuse me .
can we please call lazlo and make the switch for cynthia ?
no .
i' il tell you why we can' t do that !
because that would involve me talking to my wife , which i am never gonna do again !
i' m going to get drunk .
you believe this ?
well , erectile dysfunc ...
shut up .
i' m gonna go get jimmy .
will you ... ... watch strabo for a while ?
eat shit .
how can he get drunk at a time like this ?
maybe this whole " erectile misfiring " is god' s way of punishing me .
he sees all things great and small .
you know , i' ve done some very bad things .
i lie to jill .
i don' t take the trash out .
i killed 21 people .
actually , 22 .
who' d i forget ?
frankie figs .
this is it .
this is the reason that god does not want me to father a child .
he does not want me to spread my seed .
god is counting my seed , oz .
he' s probably up in heaven right now ... ... counting my little seeds .
1 38 , 1 39 ... ... 1 40 ...
stop , stop !
stop counting your seed .
i don' t think god is keeping an eye on your sperm .
what kind of a job is that for god ?
it' d take him all day .
i' m gonna throw up .
fine .
throw up .
go ahead , you have your fun .
what about me ?
why don' t you just consider adopting ?
come on , oz .
how many adoption agencies are gonna give a kid to a professional killer ?
you may have a point there .
maybe i could just steal a kid .
they' re small .
how hard can that be ?
that' s the thinking you gotta get away from .
but i' d be a great father , oz .
i would .
i' d be a great dad .
i' d teach the kid how to play baseball .
i' ve always been good with a bat .
true .
and , i mean , when i was kid , i had this cool little slingshot , right ?
and i could make a slingshot for my little boy .
and i could teach him how to use it .
and if he couldn' t get it right away ... ... i' d be patient .
i wouldn' t yell at him .
i wouldn' t make him cry .
jimmy , there' s a lot of people looking .
things with the husband not so well going ?
i was thinking ... ... if you were to have sex with another man ... ... it would make jimmy jealous .
oh , yeah ?
like with who ?
well , let' s say ... ... with me , for example .
you look good with a gun .
did you have a good relationship with your father , oz ?
we were like pals .
like to kill my father .
like to take an ice pick and stick it right in his eyeball .
still wanna throw up .
can you help me ?
can you tell me ?
i mean , what the ... ?
what the hell is going on here ? !
why are we all on this big , spinning ball that we call earth ? !
why ?
why ?
you ever hear of avoidance behavior ?
i don' t wanna talk about that ...
let' s talk about avoidance behavior .
like sitting here in a bar ... ... drinking shots instead of saving cynthia ?
she' il be fine , oz .
what do you mean ?
i am not gonna go out there and risk my ass for my wife ...
my wife !
whatever !
i' m not risking my ass before i get a few things off my chest .
fine .
say them .
what do you wanna say ?
you know i was a bed wetter ?
you don' t do it anymore , do you ?
at 1 2 , i saw my dad naked in the shower .
well , that' s probably why you wet the bed .
very freudian .
jungian .
we had some great times .
you and your father ?
no !
me and cynthia !
that' s almost vomit .
what was it like when cynthia told you ... ... she was pregnant ?
oh , well , that was a beautiful moment .
she' s got a great rack , doesn' t she ?
i' m sorry ?
i mean , she was so wild .
so wild .
i mean ... ... one time we wrecked an entire suite at the hotel drake .
seven thousand dollars ' worth of damage .
let' s stop talking about you and my wife .
i mean , we didn' t come out of the room for four days .
but i don' t gotta tell you , do i ?
you' re married to her , you lucky son of a bitch .
what is this thing ?
what we' ve been building .
get it out of here !
why ?
because i hate it !
it makes me sad .
what' s happening ?
what' s happening now ?
where are you going now ?
check .
good morning ...
what the hell is this ?

you are really noisy in the morning .
jimmy , what the hell happened last night ?
and why does my ass hurt ?
you fell down the stairs .
oh , good .
so nothing happened .
of course not .
not really .
what does that mean ?
we were just a couple of guys ... ... helping each other out .
that' s all .
i' m sorry , but what does that mean ?
it was a really magical night , oz .
don' t ruin it .
what is it now ?
that thing .
oh , this ?
i knew it .
oh , my god .

this is not what it looks like .

you want some help ?
i think i' m fine .

i should probably put some clothes on first .
yeah .
hey , oz , can you come in here for a sec ?
yes .

my heart is broken .

what about a locksmith ?
do you know of one in the area ?
it' s your town , dentist .
you should know where a ...

the trunk release button , how about that ?
every car since 1 985 has a trunk release button .
find it , open the trunk and let my boy out .
there' s a button on the driver' s side .
every car since 1 985 ...
we kill them the moment we see them .

well , car ranch rentals .
it' s a hitter !

what is this ?
that' s a dead hostage , oz .
that is what that is .
that can' t be good .
no , you' re right .
that' s not good .
it looks like he got shot in the foot .
who dies from a shot in the foot ?
he probably got shot when the hitter was shooting .
that' s really great .
well done , jill .
hey , look , shit happens .
that' s right .
shit happens , to you .
all the time !
you know why ?
because you don' t follow the abc' s of killing .
there' s an abc' s of killing ?
shut up !
how was i supposed to know he' d climb in the trunk ?
that' s a good question .
i mean ...
i know !
how about you just watch him ... ... and you don' t let him climb in !
i am a professional marksman .
it' s not my job to babysit ...
you know what ?
i think you have to hit something ... ... to count as a marksman .
ozzie .
harriet .
can we stop fighting and go get my wife ?

the hungarian mobster that you let die ?
he' s sorry .
he' s very sorry !
she' s coming back .
i mean , she' s gonna come back , right ?
i don' t think so .
oh , well , this is just great .
what are we gonna do now ?
you know what ?
i' m gonna leave .
you' re on your own , oz .
i thought we were friends .
well , that' s what you get for trusting a contract killer , oz .
you son of a bitch .
you can' t do this to cynthia .
okay ?
not okay .
your darling cynthia' s not completely innocent in all this , oz .
what ?
what does that mean ?
shit , shit , shit !
jill took my bag !

are you mad or something ?

i mean , seriously .
no .
all right ?

i chased you away so i could protect you , jill .
i don' t know why you don' t believe that .
i don' t believe you .
jill .
i don' t trust you .
how am i supposed to have a kid with somebody i don' t trust ?
forget it .
i don' t even know if i wanna have a kid with you anymore .
hold on a minute .
i think that if i were pregnant right now , i wouldn' t even tell you .
if you had a son and i ...
and you were his mom and i was his dad ... ... you wouldn' t let me see him ?
not once .
don' t say that .
take it back right now .
i' m not .
you better tell me everything now or i' m not gonna help you .
how far back does this thing go ?
like a couple days or something .
you' re so full of it .
you' re gonna lie to me more ?
all right , months .
you happy now ?
and why was cynthia in on it ?
i wanted to keep you out of harm' s way .
you trusted her not to get hurt .
jill .
i gotta go help oz .
for me to do that , i' ve gotta go up there .
just do everything i told you , all right ?
don' t worry .
i' il remember everything you told me .

call the fbl !
what' s wrong ?
what' s wrong ?
what' s wrong ?
i' il tell you .
everything' s wrong .
take a look around you .
nothing' s right .
cynthia got kidnapped by hungarian killers .
hey , let' s try to get in contact with somebody else that kills a lot of people .
so i went down to mexico , which is heavily underdeveloped ... ... and i asked him to help me .
did he ?
no , he didn' t help me out .
he didn' t help me out !
know what he did ?
he put on bunny slippers ... ... he shot at me and then he cooked me some chicken !
i' m gonna be okay .
i' m gonna calm down ... ... i' m gonna go downstairs and i' m gonna take a nice , leisurely drive in my porsche .
wait a minute .
i can' t drive my porsche , because i don' t have one anymore .
that' s gone , that' s history , that' s archives !
we left the porsche so we could get on a bus and rent some other car .
and you know why ?
because i don' t .
do you ?
some kind of gps , i don' t know , system .
what' s that smell ?
i' il tell you what that smell is .
it' s me .
i smell .
and you know why ?
i' ve been wearing this suit for three days .
i smell like ass .
or foot .
or some kind of foot ... ... that' s been lodged up deep , deep , deep inside an ass .
i woke up naked next to another naked man who admittedly wets the bed .
so if you talk to anybody or anybody calls here ... ... you tell them i fell down a flight of stairs .
yes , sir .
don' t " yes , sir " me !
call the fbl .

i' m calling .
dial f b i.
call the fbi and tell them i fell down a flight of stairs !
going to the feds is the thing that' s gonna get cynthia killed .
what are you doing here ?
i don' t need you anymore .
i can handle this on my own .
i' m an adult .
you okay ?
thanks .
let' s face it , oz .
kicking ass is not your expertise .
that' s my job .
hanging on to the woman you love is where i fall a little short .
how do you do that ?
what ?
that .
that .
one minute i wanna kill you , the next minute you got me ... ... feeling sorry for you .
oz , you really are a good guy .
and i don' t want you , cynthia or anyone else paying for my past sins .
i thought you said friendship was overrated .
i' m a liar .
so , what do we do ?
go get cynthia .
how ?
you just leave that to jimmy tudeski .
god , julie .
julie , julie ... ... don' t call the fbl !
julie who ?
my receptionist .
your wife' s replacement .
julie , what did you do ?
i chloroformed his ass .
why ?
you don' t have to tell me why .
now , you can go quietly or your ass can get the chloroform too .
what kind of receptionist are you ?
the kind that doesn' t forget ... ... who murdered her brother .
what ?
look , i' m gonna get the temp agency on the phone .
don' t you dare make a move , dr. oseransky .
keep your ass right there .
julie .
julie , if that is your real name ...
my name is jules .
jules figueroa .
frankie figs ?
frankie figs .
you remember that ?
he was my brother .
and i do believe you knew him .
i' il take that chloroform now .
yeah , i know you will .
you smell great , baby .
oz .
you know , i don' t have to be at work today .
oz .
jimmy .
jimmy .
jimmy !
it' s been a long time since i' ve been chloroformed .
still got that little zing to it , though .
tastes like they put a bunch of pennies in your mouth , doesn' t it ?
jimmy , i' m sorry .
i didn' t find it .
what ?
you' ve been here three days .
i got into the safe .
it' s not there .
safe ?
it' s here somewhere .
this isn' t exactly ... ... what we talked about , either .
calm down .
what do mean , " calm down " ?
all right ?
i' m on it .
what safe ?
why are you guys talking together so much ?
have you been involved in this from the beginning ?
oz ...
correct me if i' m wrong ... ... but we took vows .
one was you' re not supposed to pretend you' re kidnapped ... ... and get your husband shot at while he' s trying to save you .
that was uncalled for .
i' m not a lawyer ... ... but i believe this is grounds for divorce .
and what is that sound ?
that' s chain saws .
chain saw .
check .
hack tub .
what is that for ?
what is it ?
they hack us up into pieces in that ... ... so blood doesn' t get everywhere .
i see .
they put the hacked up pieces in those bags .
are you done ?
yes , he' s done .
jimmy tulip .
the rat shit scum of chicago .
mr. tough guy ... ... served up to me on a platter by the pretty black girl .
that stings .
i made you who you are and you stab me in the heart ... ... with something sharp .
he made you who you are ?
oh , yes .
could not fire a slingshot until i taught him how .
pay attention , little boy .
hold it firm .
stop crying and watch .
like this .
where' s strabo ?
i' m pretty sure he' s with janni right now .

aren' t you forgetting something ?
am i forgetting something ?
i don' t think so .
they had a terrible fight .

what if i had something you want ?
i would be baffled , to begin with .
or , more precisely ... ... half of something you want .

you have jimmy' s half .
would you cut me in for a slice ?
you want a slice of the pee ?
maybe ...
keep talking .
i wanna work for you .
of course you do .
i don' t have any allegiances .
i' m all yours .
and i could be your most valuable hitter .
you shut up or i' il blow your brains out !
first thing i' m going to need is my son strabo in my company .
secondly , maybe a little test .
i' m thinking , kill jimmy .
in the melon .
one shot .
what do you say ?
name the time and place .
is now good for you ?
right here , right now ?
right now .
you gotta be kidding me , right ?
what the hell are you doing ?
take your little cross back .
what' il you do without your good luck charm ?
stop screwing around .
shut up , oz !
that' s right , jill , stop screwing around .
you' re not gonna shoot anybody .
just tell me you' re not still in love with cynthia .
i' m not gonna do that .
why ?
she' s my ex wife .
i still have feelings for her and i always will .
that' s a really bad answer .
shut up , oz .
you can' t even just say it , can you ?
just say it .
the hourglass of my sand children .
listen , you' re either a shooter or you' re not .
i am .
i am .
i am .
got an elevator shaft around here , lazlo ?
i' m sorry ?
because i could fall down that , you know .
die that way .
stop .
that would be the only way to get killed .
shut up !
you couldn' t even hit that lamp over there .
i' il give you a tip .
you wanna hit that lamp , you should aim at me .
she aimed and hit the lamp .
she aimed and hit the lamp .
lucky shot .
i' m gonna give you one last chance , baby .
you don' t have the balls .
this from a guy who rarely gets it up .
we never had that problem .
not helping .
why isn' t anybody helping ?
i think you have to be in love with someone to get it up , jill .
shoot him .
you' re never gonna be a hit girl ... ... just a stupid , stumbling , bumbling , can' t kill anything ex dental assistant .
jimmy , jimmy .
he' s dead ?
yes ?
he' s dead .
he' s dead !
he' s dead !
i didn' t think you had it in you , quite frankly .
don' t cry .
everything' s going to be fine .
go get strabo , now .
give me this .
for the record , this is , what , a garage door opener ?
very clever .
so clever , i want you to keep that aimed at her , please .
wait .
i thought we had a deal .
" i thought we had a deal . " no .
locked .
lazlo , the car is loaded with primacord .
i' m sure it is .
the first dollar i ever stole is back together .
you okay ?
you okay ?
yeah .
you killed strabonitz .
oh , look what i did .
good work , jimmy .
jammy , jammy .
nice work with that chair , oz .
way to go , cyn .
come here , baby .
you' re alive ?
i mean , good , but you ...
don' t even think about it .
you were in on this whole thing from the beginning !
of course .
it' s an old routine .
it' s the skokie switcheroo .
the skokie switch ... " ?
where do you guys come up with these names ?
i just watched my friend get shot through the heart .
larry' s house of halloween .
and what is the deal with that lamp ?
i saw her shoot the lamp .
the first round was live , the rest were blanks .
try and keep up .
we are gonna have such a talk later .
sons of batches !
so how far back does this go ?
hell , you were shooting at me in mexico .
was that all part of the plan ?
as a matter of fact , it was , yeah .
you killed my strabo !
actually , strabonitz was already dead .
your hitter got him when she was shooting at us .
this true ?
lazlo , shit happens .
shit ...
yeah , watch this shit happen .
all right .
take it easy .
was that real ?
is she really dead ?
i mean , was that a fake bullet ?
jimmy , let me propose something before you start the killing .
regroup the gogolak gang .
fifty fifty , you and me .
like the old days .
murder , mayhem , a couple of laughs .
i don' t think so , lazlo .
jill , tie him up .
wait .
what am i gonna tie him up for ?
i' m gonna kill him .
no , he said ...
i said that , but we can' t .
of course you can' t .
you can' t kill anybody for real .
i can .
it' s point blank range .
i didn' t mean you can' t shoot him ... ... i mean you just can' t shoot him .
come on .
you said i' il make my bones .
on somebody else .
you can' t kill him .
how do you " make bones " ?
she wants to make a name for herself .
you said i could !
will you just listen ?
tell me why .
you heard what he said !
tell me why not !
because he' s my father !
even i didn' t know about this .
see ?
see ?
it doesn' t feel good to not be involved in the plan , to not know what ...
he' s your father ?
i raised you as one of my own .
that' s far enough .
i made him a man !
a man who can' t kill his papa .
step aside , jill .
it could go right through .
jimmy .
jill , shoot papa in the foot .
straight through or leave a souvenir ?
souvenir .
wait .
that' s gotta hurt .
who is that ?
the fake police ?
okay , we gotta go .
i' m not going anywhere until somebody tells me what this is all about .
cynthia , help me get oz out of here .
thanks for the inheritance , pops .
way to go , cyn .
you' il never live to spend a dime , jimmy !
we' re rich !
we' re rich !
baby , you were so good .
i had a good teacher .
i' m so glad we' re so overjoyed .
i' ve never been this confused in my life .
i think you dropped this a while back .
no , just borrowing it from an old friend , that' s all .
don' t need it anymore , cyn .
okay .
would somebody tell me what' s going on ?
this is what' s going on .
see that number right there ?
that is lazlo gogolak' s main account in the grand caymans .
somewhere around 280 million dollars , half of which is yours .
your tooth pulling days are over , oz .
that was the plan ?
yes !
were you in on it ?
i didn' t know until this afternoon .
why couldn' t i have been involved ?
i could have played a part .
i minored in theater .
two hundred and eighty million dollars ?
that' s it .
this is too much .
it' s great , but it' s too much .
any more surprises ?
just one .
what ?
i guess the doctors were wrong .
what do you mean ?
i' m pregnant .
oh , my god , congratulations !
oh , my god , are you serious ?
i' m gonna be a dad ?
we' re not gonna start with that again , are we ?
put the top up , okay ?
it' s just ...
it' s embarrassing .
come on , come and get me .
