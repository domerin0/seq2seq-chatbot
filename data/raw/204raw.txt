they got a bleeding generator grinding away .
lights on all over the place .
not expecting visitors , are they ?
spread out .
take cover .
let' s not wake them up .
you gonna use grenades , captain ?
may not be too easy .
might bounce against those screens .
yeah .
i suppose they might .
scott .
sir ?
do you think , i mean , given a chance ... that you could operate the kind of transmitter they' ve got in there ?
i' il have to have a look at it , but it' s probably basically the same thing .
good .
i think we might give it a try .
give what a try ?
if the three of us could get in there unnoticed ...
i could dispose of him ... and you two could send back our fake message on their transmitter .
rather a nice touch of irony , don' t you think ?
what' re you trying to pull , captain ?
that wasn' t in our orders .
no , lieutenant .
it' s evident that one of us has to get in there in any case ... to make sure of destroying their transmitter .
so why not go the whole hog ?
our orders were damn plain , captain .
we were to send the message on our transmitter .
if that didn' t work out , we were to destroy theirs .
but nobody said a damn thing ...
do be quiet .
i' m going over there to deal with the operator .
when you see me come back to the window , you and scott will join me .
we' il send our message , destroy their transmitter , and leave .
is that clear ?
yes , sir .
no , sir .
i' m having no part of it , captain .
you' re disobeying orders and going beyond your authority .
you' il do as you' re told .
what about that sentry , sir ?
keep him covered , but don' t shoot unless he does .
not even if he sees me .
even if he sees you ?
i' m going to walk straight across there .
even if he does see me , he' s quite likely to assume i' m one of his chaps .
sir .
what is it ?
you' d look a lot less english without that hat on .
captain !
i' m telling you now .
you' re going against col. thompson' s orders .
if you go in there , i' m not going with you .
you hear me ?
i haven' t got time to argue , lieutenant .
you know what you have to do .
there he is .
what' s the matter ?
you heard me tell him i' m not going in there .
we' re running out of time .
what' s the matter with you ?
i told him .
come on , scott .
let' s go !
are you ready to transmit yet ?
i think so , sir .
where the devil' s the lieutenant ?
i don' t know , sir .
lawson !
i told him .
i know you did .
but they' re in there now , waiting for you .
go on , get moving !
come on , move !
where' s the lieutenant ?
how the hell should i know ?
i haven' t seen him .
have you ?
of course i haven' t .
then let' s go .
i don' t know .
you can please yourself , what you do .
i' m off .
i' m not waiting around for that rubbish sack .
coming in , hearne .
what' re you doing ?
you' re supposed to be gone three minutes ago .
yes , sir .
i was only waiting for you because i thought you ...
blimey .
this is a turn up for the book .
oh , god , looks like the whole japanese air force out there .
look at that .
like the swing shift at lockheed .
i don' t believe it .
three rousing , great cheers for american air reconnaissance .
let' s get the hell out of here .
come on .
get me out of here !
what' re you stopping for ?
which way ?
to the right , go around .
come on .
go around .
to the right , come on !
give us covering fire , thornton .
what' s that ?
scatter .
good afternoon , gentlemen .
this is major yamaguchi ... who has the pleasure of addressing you .
no doubt you are quite amazed to hear my voice .
in order to be sure ... that you are hearing me ...
i was obliged to make this speech five times today .
but tomorrow , as we close in on you ... you will hear only four such speeches .
on saturday ... if you have not already been killed or captured ... only two .
captured ?
if you look at your map , you will see ... that as you travel south ... towards your base ... your situation is like that of water ... in a funnel .
what' s he on about ?
do you understand ?
like water in a funnel .
no matter where you may now be , or which route you take ... you will eventually wish to emerge at your base .
as the funnel narrows ... as you get closer to home ... we will have less and less area to cover ... in our search for you .
we have found your abandoned radio transmitter .
we know our air power in this area ... came as a surprise to you ... and you must communicate this information to your base .
but this will not happen .
within three days ... you will all be killed or captured .
there is , however , an alternative .
you should consider it carefully .
if you will all surrender now ... just one week from today , by which time ... your plans and ours will be an open secret ... you will be released ... and allowed to return to your own base .
this offer is a reasonable one .
certainly you should consider it carefully .
but , remember , it must be all of you .
there can be no exceptions .
i shall speak to you again tomorrow , by which time ...
i hope that good sense will have prevailed .
if you wish to take advantage of our offer ... you will fire a single shot as a signal .
up your khyber .
that is all .
good day , gentlemen .
and good day to you , you malignant yellow dwarf .
they must be right behind us .
if that amplification' s strong enough , they could be a helluva long way .
what do you think , sir ?
about what ?
it seems like they' re on to us .
do you think they mean what they' re saying ?
don' t be bloody stupid .
he did say they' d treat us all right .
they' il chop your bloody head off .
since when have you been an expert ?
what do you know about it , bigmouth ?
a sight more than you do , pig face .
i saw what they did in the hospital in singapore .
you were so busy running you never even saw a jap ...
let alone what they did to our lads .
they won' t take us to a rest camp now that we know where that airstrip is .
he' s right .
damn right .
now let' s get out of here .
okay , come on .
all right , move out .
all right , get some sleep .
god , i' m tired .
got to sleep .
got to .
good morning , gentlemen .
this is saturday .
and the funnel in which you are trapped is rapidly narrowing .
i anticipated that you' d accept my terms .
instead , you evidently marched ... throughout the day , and , perhaps , most of the night .
a remarkable effort .
your leader must be a man of great determination .
you have very little reason to be pleased with him ... because his stubborn determination ... has inspired me ... to alter the terms of our offer .
this offer now has a time limit .
you have until sundown to surrender .
after that , you will be killed on sight .
in war , one must take harsh measures .
i' m sorry if you do not like these new rules ... but the responsibility rests with your leader .
remember , you have only to fire a single shot .
but please remember also ... that any surrender must include all of you .
you understand ?
all of you .
i will give you a few minutes to consider your decision .
how about it now , lieutenant ?
what ?
quit ?
no way .
they' re not getting their hands on me .
this time tomorrow , i' il be back at that camp .
i don' t think you know what you' re talking about .
even the jap said it was all your fault .
i think we should turn in .
what do you say , thornton ?
look , mate ...
i couldn' t give a bugger about the yank' s reasons for wanting to carry on ... because i happen to know they' re half baked anyway .
and if you want to believe that jap , you can , but they' re not gonna get me .
i' d sooner shoot you than trust them .
as a matter of fact ... much sooner .
how do you know the japs are lying ?
what makes you think they' re all that different from us ?
that' s right , kid , they' re not .
that' s why that jap major could be lying , just like i would .
you remain indecisive .
i am sorry .
perhaps when you have rested ... you will feel different .
but the conditions remain the same .
you have until dusk to give yourselves up .
that is all .
i knew it .
he wants to draw our fire and kill us all .
how do you know that' s what he said ?
wanna wait a couple of minutes ?
they' il be here .
in that case , now' s the time to pack it in .
watch it , darling .
they' re coming .
clear that place .
get down !
knife .
come on , let' s get out of here .
get him out of there .
quick , damn it .
come on , you guys , give us a hand .
get him out of there .
griffiths , get my pack .
yes , sir .
mclean !
yes , sir ?
get behind him .
pick him up and get him up the hill .
come on .
move down .
he can' t move .
come on .
quick , hurry up .
come on , damn it .
move your ass !
come on !
move !
that' s the way .
i' il lead them off up here .
that' s the way .
day and night , service is on hand , sir .
come on , boys .
don' t drop him now .
watch out for those man eating trout .
easy .
you weigh a bleeding ton .
that' s it .
easy , thorny .
tosh , my old buddy , how does it look back there ?
it' s not so bad .
you' il be all right .
what kind of nonsense is that , man ?
i can feel where the scorching thing went in , and i can' t feel where it came out .
yeah , you are leaking a bit .
hold up !
that makes your eyes water , doesn' t it ?
is that tight enough ?
yeah .
right , now put your little pinkie on the knot .
that' s right .
very pretty .
i' m ready for my coming out ball .
you' il get " coming out " in a minute .
take your finger away when i say , " go .
ready , steady , go .
there we are .
i shouldn' t worry about it .
no , you shouldn' t , but maybe i should ?
that bloody yankee poonagger' s not coming back .
that' s all right .
thornton' s not going anywhere , are you , jock ?
no , i' m having my change of life .
can he walk ?
only on the water .
yeah .
that' s it then .
do you hear that , lads ?
if anyone' s going mad ...
we' ve either got to leave him here or turn ourselves in , right ?
i already told you , nobody' s turning it in .
what are you gonna do with him ?
you can' t bloody carry him back , can you ?
you' re so bloody clever , hearne .
what are you gonna do with him ?
listen , you poxed up glaswegian queer !
it' s bad enough sitting here full of bloody holes ... without listening to you open your ugly face !
knock it off .
i can hear you halfway down the trail .
what' s the matter with you guys , anyway ?
it' s thornton , sir .
he can' t walk .
i was just saying we' ve either gotta leave him here or turn ourselves in .
now , suppose you let me worry about that ?
meanwhile , you just rest your toes because we' re leaving before dark .
back in a minute , thorny .
thanks , tosh .
that blood' s worth bottling .
look at that pair .
i see snow white' s found his first dwarf .
a right teddy bear' s picnic this has turned out to be .
how long has thornton got ?
i don' t know .
but he won' t be here next week , that' s for certain .
where are you going ?
where are you off ?
you know what that yank' s gonna do , don' t you ?
what ?
he' s not leaving you here alive .
he' d sooner kill you himself .
kill me ?
why shouldn' t he ?
all he cares about is getting back to the camp .
he doesn' t give a bugger about you .
i heard him say so .
go to hell .
the only thing to do to get you out of here safely ... to see you' re looked after , is to turn ourselves in .
i' il go with mclean and griffiths and talk to the japs .
you try that and i' il shoot you myself .
don' t be daft , man .
what else is there ?
you cowardly pig .
you just want to save your own skin , you hear me ?
now look here , thornton .
for god' s sake , man ... can' t you even leave a fellow in peace ?
i' m sorry .
i really am .
i was only thinking of you .
come on , take a wee drop of water .
come on , now .
i' il hold it up for you .
come on , drink it now .
mclean !
quickly !
wake up !
wake up !
thornton' s had it !
there' s no telling what the yank will do now .
what is it ?
come on , wake up .
what' s the matter ?
thornton' s dead .
come on !
what about tosh ?
leave him .
you can' t leave tosh .
once we get to the japs , we' il all be all right .
him as well .
wake up !
wake up , you stupid bastard !
where the hell are they ?
how the bloody hell do i know ?
you' re the one who' s supposed to be on guard .
stupid , dirty bastards !
you going after them ?
no , it' s too late .
they' re probably closer to the japs than we are .
the only way they' il stay alive is by telling that jap major where we are .
come on , let' s go .
good afternoon , gentlemen .
from what your comrades have told me ...
i may assume that you are now hearing me .
as you must know ... your comrades decided to try and save their lives ... by surrendering and informing us of your position .
but you escaped ... and so their fate is still in doubt .
their surrender is of little value unless you choose to join them .
if you will surrender before dark ...
i shall keep my word .
you will be well treated ... and released in only a few days .
the man , campbell , did not merit such good treatment .
he was found to be carrying the personal effects of one of our officers ... our communications lieutenant ... who has been missing since last tuesday .
his body was discovered yesterday .
our lieutenant was very popular with his men .
you would understand that there was little i could do to restrain them ...
even if i had wanted to .
it has been an incident in which none of us can take pride .
however , the real problem still remains .
you must decide what you want done with the two comrades ... who are still our prisoners .
it is for you to say if they shall live .
if you wish to stay alive ... you must persuade your two friends to surrender .
do you understand ?
yes , sir .
you may talk to them .
lieutenant ?
tosh ?
it' s me , mclean .
it' s right , what the major was saying .
about campbell , i mean .
they showed us the stuff he stole from the officer ... and how he chopped his finger off to get the ring .
there wasn' t anything anyone could' ve done to stop them .
but we' re all right .
it is necessary for you to persuade them .
i know we shouldn' t have gone off with campbell like we did .
and i know we shouldn' t have told them where you were hiding ... but it was campbell' s idea , and we thought it was for the best .
listen , if you don' t give yourselves up now ... we' il be the ones who end up paying for it .
your corporal is giving you excellent advice .
there is no longer a choice for any of you .
either you surrender and live ... or if you attempt to postpone the inevitable ... then i shall withdraw my offer ... and your two comrades will die tonight .
the decision is yours .
you have until nightfall to decide .
please , lieutenant ... do like he says .
tosh , please !
i couldn' t care less what they do to those two .
whatever that jap' s gonna do , he' s gonna do .
it' s got nothing to do with what we' re gonna do .
if you mean it ain' t gonna make us surrender ...
i' m with you .
but if you think we' re gonna try and get back to camp by tomorrow ... you must be bloody mad .
that' s exactly what we' re gonna do .
we hit that clearing on the edge of that camp ... if there are two of us ... we' re gonna have twice as much a chance of getting through .
and , buddy boy ... you' re going with me every step of the way .
listen , lieutenant ... neither of us wants to get killed , right ?
i' ve never believed any of the guff that jap' s been giving us , either .
i know once he lays his hands on us ... he' il finish us off , no matter what he says .
so , up until now ... the only way of staying alive was getting back to camp .
but now there' s another way .
something that nobody else thought of .
nobody except me , that is .
what ?
it' s very simple .
we double back , head north for two or three hours ... duck off the trail , sleep for a couple of days ... and we' il be laughing .
laughing ?
yeah , laughing .
because once the jap dive bombers ... get stuck into the yank ships monday morning ... the jap major won' t be looking for us anymore .
right ?
he couldn' t care less where we are then .
we can just lie low for a couple of days ... stroll back into camp ... and nobody will say a dickie bird .
what' s so bad about that ?
i never asked those idiots to send me out here .
well done , hearne .
jolly good show .
now you can piss off home ...
back to whatever dirty little hole you came from .
and what are they gonna do for you , lieutenant ?
make you the bloody president ?
no .
getting ourselves killed ... isn' t going to make any difference to anybody except us .
look , yank ... the last thing that jap major is gonna be looking for ... is us heading north .
so what do you say ?
you got any idea how many guys will get killed on those ships ... if we haven' t got the guts to try and stop them ?
okay , so a couple of hundred yanks will get the chop .
they shouldn' t have joined , should they ?
hundreds ?
thousands .
in any case , it' s not the bloody yanks you' re worried about ... because if their chances depend on us getting back ... they' ve just about had it in the first place .
no , what' s got you jumping about like a frog with a bullet up its ass ... is old fairy feet hornsby ... because you reckon you let him down .
and that' s the one bloody time you' ve been right .
you did .
you might just as well have killed him yourself .
but getting us killed isn' t gonna make up for that .
so hornsby is your problem .
and those yank sailors are your problem .
and if you wanna start playing bloody heroes ...
i' ve got another problem for you .
i' m not bloody well coming with you .
you forgot your problem .
me .
i told you before ... one of us has gotta get back there alive .
and if you don' t go with me , i' il have to leave you here .
dead .
understood ?
understood .
just don' t forget .
gentlemen , your time is up !
i shall give you 30 seconds .
if you do not give yourselves up ...
i shall be forced to execute your two comrades .
let me talk to him .
listen to me , lieutenant , please .
you' ve gotta listen to me .
they' re gonna kill us .
just like they killed campbell .
please , lieutenant , don' t let them do it .
do you really find it so easy to believe that i would shoot you ?
keep going .
get up .
there' s not much further to go .
how the hell would you know ?
there can' t be .
no more , thank you , sir .
thank you , sir .
get up , you limey son of a bitch , or i' il kick your head in !
get up .
good morning , again .
you must be very tired .
you have come a long way during the night .
a truly remarkable effort .
remarkable , but to very little purpose .
shut up , you slimy yellow nob .
you have moved fast ... but we have moved faster .
you will find that you are now very near the open field ... that serves as a perimeter to your base .
but some of my men are already on that perimeter .
in short , you are now totally surrounded .
you are now at the very tip of the funnel i have talked about so often .
i can understand your determination ... but to give up your lives for an objective ... which cannot be won is a foolish waste .
you have shown yourselves to be brave soldiers .
it shows us that you are intelligent ones also .
give yourselves up and live .
i assure you , the medals they give to dead heroes are made of brass .
all they do is add weight to your coffin .
you bloody idiot !
believe me ... your situation is truly hopeless .
all trails leading back into the jungle are under guard .
this means ... that you can no longer hide ... you can no longer double back on your tracks .
what' s that all about ?
better get the sergeant major .
i shall give you three minutes during which time ... you will wish to confirm for yourselves ... that what i have said is true .
at the end of that time ... you must either surrender or die .
you will fire a single shot to indicate that you have surrendered .
or my men will close in and kill .
stand to !
what is it ?
don' t know what it is , sergeant major .
get col. thompson !
double !
get the color sergeant .
yes , sergeant major .
what the hell is it ?
what is it , sergeant major ?
i don' t know what it is .
i' ve sent for the old man .
you better man the weapon pits .
right .
come on , let' s have you fast now !
what do you think this is , kensington gardens ?
come on !
get in with that gun !
get in there .
make sure the men stay back , sergeant .
you men know the drill !
keep back !
stay out of enemy range !
laid on !
morning , sir .
morning , sergeant major .
everything in order ?
yes , sir .
mortars ?
all weapon pits are manned , sir .
sounds like loudspeakers of some kind .
got any more bright suggestions ?
my patience is growing very short .
he must think we' ve still got a chance .
who must ?
guchi .
why are they giving us three minutes ?
why don' t they just come and get us ?
yeah .
why ?
i don' t know .
maybe they' re spread too thin .
maybe they' re afraid to come in , for fear of chasing us out in the open .
yeah , and having to waste all those bullets to shoot us ?
maybe .
but there' s still two of us ... and one of us just might make it .
you now have only two and a half more minutes .
we could sure use some covering fire .
think your guys will be doing anything ?
yeah .
having breakfast .
we could use all the help we can get .
maybe if we fire that shot ...
why waste a bullet ?
what do you mean ?
fire one shot and maybe we' il confuse the japs a bit .
but if we could kill their major ... they wouldn' t have anyone to tell them what to do .
they' d be running about all over the place .
might give us a head start .
and that little bastard' s been asking for it for a long time , hasn' t he ?
this way .
two minutes .
you now have only one and a half more minutes , gentlemen .
stand them to , sergeant .
all guns stand to !
the rest of you keep back !
out of enemy range !
it worked .
they' ve gone back .
don' t forget to zigzag .
you zig , i' il zag .
look there !
there they are !
can you make out which ones they are ?
lay down covering fire , sergeant !
hurry !
give those men covering fire !
correct right , sergeant !
three turns more right !
more left !
come on !
he' s all right .
he' s alive .
he' s getting up .
he' s alive !
cease fire !
all guns cease fire !
machine gunners , stand by to give us covering fire !
take it easy , lad .
were there any other survivors ?
was it just the two of you ?
who was that with you out there ?
i said ... who was that with you out there ?
out there ... he was a bloody hero .
he killed ... fifteen bleeding japs ... single handed .
killed fifteen ?
thirty , if you like .
