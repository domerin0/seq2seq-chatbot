he' s got a doberman .
best way' s just to shoot' im .
how are we get a gun ?
my mom has one .
we cant just knock him over the head and drag him off somewhere .

my grandpa was a bad junk ... really bad .
he' d rape anyone dumb enough to walk by his room ...
one night , he got , really pissed on my grandma , he need to take a climb on to her face ,
and , after that , he just , he locked himself up with her in his room , for two whole days
and he just kept drinking and having sex with her after she' s dead .
my mom was in the house the whole time ...
fuck ...
she was only 15 .
holy shit .
you know , it really messed with her head .
after that she only hanged out with guys who' d beat the hell out of her
and then , when i was little , she' d get drunk , and she' d drag me and my brother out of the bed at four in the morning , and she had all the news , clippings , about my grandpa , and she' d read them over and over again ...
then , i knew every word before kindergarden ...
i think that' s how i learned to read .
she' s gone .
we should go .
that chick ali gave me a blowjob last night , and i fucked her .
she called again , sais you all going back to weston ...
