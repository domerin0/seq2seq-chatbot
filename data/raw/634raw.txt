wolfie ?
what ?
there' s a young girl here to see you .
what does she want ?
she won' t talk to me .
she says she has to speak to you .
damn .
yes ?
are you herr mozart ?
that' s right .
my name is lorl , sir .
i ' m a maidservant .
i was asked to come here and offer my services to you .
they' il be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain . . . . . . anonymous .
is this your idea , papa ?
mine ?
are you playing a trick on me ?
i' ve never seen this girl .
is this some kind of joke ?
not at all , sir .
young woman , this won' t do .
my son can' t accept such an offer , no matter how generous . . . . . . unless he knows who' s behind it .
i can' t tell you that , sir .
this is ridiculous !
what is ridiculous ?
wolfie has many admirers in vienna .
people send us gifts all the time .
you cannot accept her without references .
well , this is none of your business .
whoever sent you is going to pay ?
that' s right .
splendid !
now we ' re going to let a stranger into our house .
who is we ?
who is letting who ?
could you please wait outside ?
yes , ma' am .
look , old man !
we spend a fortune on you , and all you can do is criticize .
and now  stanzi !
no !
it' s right that he should hear !
i ' m sick to death of it .
we can' t do anything right for you , can we ?
you won' t have to do anything for me ever again .
i ' m leaving .
no , papa .
i won' t stay and be a burden .
no one calls you that .
she does .
she says i sleep all day .
and so you do !
the only time you come out is to eat .
well , what do you expect ?
do you expect anyone to walk out into a mess like this every day ?
so now i ' m a bad housekeeper !
so you are .
it' s a pigsty .
when can you start ?
right away , ma' am .
good .
they ' re out every night , sir .
thank you , sir .
do any pupils come to the house ?
not that i' ve seen .
then how does he pay for all this ?
does he work at all ?
yes , sir .
all day long .
he never leaves the house till evening .
he just sits there , writing and writing .
really ?
what is it he' s writing ?
i wouldn' t know that , sir .
of course not .
you ' re a good girl .
you ' re very kind to do this .
the next time you ' re sure they' il be out of the house , let me know .
thank you , sir .
i think i found out about the money .
yes ?
what ?
he kept seven snuff boxes in here .
i could swear they were all gold .
and now look .
there' s only one left .
where does he work ?
i have just heard some news that may be of interest to you .
what ?
mozart is writing a new opera .
an ltalian opera .
ltalian ?
that' s not all .
he has chosen for his subject , figaro .
the marriage of figaro .
he is setting that play to music ?
yes .
what is this marriage of figaro ?
it' s a french play , kappelmeister .
it has been banned by the emperor .
you' re absolutely sure ?
gentlemen , sit down .
are you aware that i have declared the french play of figaro ... ... unsuitable for our theatre ?
yes , sire .
yet we hear you' re making an opera from it .
ls this true ?
who told you ?
it is not your place to ask questions .
ls it true ?
yes .
i admit it is .
would you tell me why ?
majesty , it is only a comedy .
what you think ... ... is scarcely the point .
it' s what his majesty thinks that counts .
i am a tolerant man .
i do not censor things lightly .
when i do , i have good reason .
figaro ... ... is a bad play .
it stirs up hatred between classes .
ln france it has caused nothing but bitterness .
my sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning ... ... to be frightened of her own people .
sire , i swear to you , there' s nothing like that in the piece .
i took out everything that could give offense .
i hate politics .
i' m afraid you' re rather innocent , my friend .
ln these dangerous times ... ... l cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people ... ... simply over a theatre piece .
majesty , this is just a frolic .
a piece about love .
love .
again !
and it' s new !
it' s entirely new .
it' s so new that people will go mad for it .
i have scenes ....
the end of the second act , for example ....
it' s a simple duet ... ... just a husband and a wife quarreling .
suddenly ... ... the wife' s scheming little maid comes in .
it' s a very funny situation .
duet turns into trio .
the valet enters .
he' s plotting with the maid .
trio turns into quartet .
then a gardener comes in .
quartet becomes quintet , and so on and on ... ... sextet , septet , octet .
how long do you think i can sustain that ?
i have no idea .
guess .
guess , your majesty .
lmagine the longest it could be sustained ... ... then double it .
6 ?
7 minutes .
8 minutes ?
20 , sire !
20 minutes !
20 minutes of continuous music .
no recitatives !
only opera can do this .
ln a play , if more than one person speaks at once ... ... it' s just noise .
no one can understand a word .
but with opera , with music ....
with music you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time .
and it' s not noise .
it' s a perfect harmony !
music is not the issue .
no one doubts your talent .
it' s your literary judgment that' s in question .
even with the politics taken out of it , it would still remain a vulgar farce .
why waste your spirit on such rubbish ?
surely ... ... you can choose more elevated themes .
elevated !
what does that mean , elevated ?
i am fed ... ... to the teeth with these ... ... elevated things .
old dead legends .
why must we go on forever ... ... writing only about gods and legends ?
because they do .
they go on forever .
at least what they represent : the eternal in us .
opera is here to ennoble us , mozart .
you and me , just the same as his majesty .
come on now , be honest !
who wouldn' t rather listen to a hairdresser than hercules ?
or horatius or orpheus .
so lofty , they sound as if they shit marble !
what !
govern your tongue , mozart , how dare you !
forgive me , majesty .
i' m a vulgar man .
but , i assure you , my music is not .
you are passionate , mozart ... ... but you do not persuade .
sire , the whole opera is finished .
you know how much work i did ?
his majesty has been ... ... more than patient .
how can i persuade you if i can' t show it ?
that will do .
let me tell how it begins .
may i just do that ?
show how it begins ?
please .
there' s a servant down on his knees .
and do you know why ?
not from any oppression , no .
because he' s measuring a space .
do you know what for ?
his bed .
his wedding bed .
to see if it will fit !
late !
on the beat .
good !
yes !
early !
mozart is already rehearsing .
ln that case , gentlemen , i think ...
... we should help him all we can .
and do our best to protect him against the emperor' s anger .
what anger ?
about the ballet .
what ballet ?
excuse me ... ... but didn' t his majesty specifically ... ... forbid the ballet at his opera ?
a word with you .
certainly , herr direktor .
now , herr mozart !
five minutes , please .
do you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas ?
it' s not a ballet , it' s a dance at figaro' s wedding .
exactly .
a dance .
surely , his majesty didn' t mean no dancing when it' s in the story .
it is dangerous to interpret his edicts .
give me your score , please .
thank you .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
taking out what you should never have put in .
please .
i have no one else to turn to .
what is it ?
it' s unbelievable .
the direktor has actually torn up a huge section of my music .
they say i have to rewrite the opera .
but it' s perfect as it is .
i can' t ... ... rewrite what' s perfect .
please .
can' t you talk to him ?
why bother with rosenberg ?
he' s no friend of yours .
i could kill him .
i mean , really !
kill him !
i threw the entire score into the fire , he made me so angry .
you burned the score ?
no , my wife took it out in time .
thank god .
it' s unfair that a man like that should have power over our work .
but others have power over him .
i think i' il take this up with the emperor .
excellency ... ... would you ?
with all my heart , mozart .
thank you .
please , herr mozart .
please , it' s not a holy relic .
i don' t need to tell you i said nothing whatever to the emperor .
i went to the theatre to tell mozart something , anything ... ... when suddenly ... ... in the middle of the third act ... ... to my astonishment , the emperor ... ... who never attended rehearsals ... ... suddenly appeared .
what is this ?
i don' t understand .
ls it modern ?
the herr direktor ... ... he has removed un balletto ... ... that would have occurred at this place .
why ?
it' s your regulation .
no ballet in your opera .
do you like this ?
it' s not a question of liking .
your own law decrees it , i' m afraid .
look at them !
this is nonsense !
let me see the scene with the music .
oblige me !
can we see the scene with the music back , please ?
certainly !
certainly , herr direktor .
bring the palace set back in , please .
the restored third act ... ... was bold , brilliant .
the fourth ... ... was astounding .
i saw a woman ... ... disguised in her maid' s clothes ... ... hear her husband speak the first tender words he' d offered her in years .
simply because he thinks she is someone else .
i heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theatre ... ... conferring on all who sat there perfect absolution .
god was singing through this little man ... ... to all the world .
unstoppable .
making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar .
and then ... do you know what happened ?
a miracle !
with that yawn ... ... l saw my defeat turn ... ... into a victory .
mozart was lucky the emperor yawned only once .
three yawns ... ... and the opera would fail the same night .
two yawns ... ... within a week at most .
with one yawn ... ... the composer could still get ... ... nine performances !
nine , that' s all it' s had ... and withdrawn .
i know , i know .
it' s outrageous .
still , if the public doesn' t like one' s work ... ... one has to accept the fact gracefully .
but what is it they don' t like ?
i can speak for the emperor .
you make too many demands on the royal ear .
he can' t concentrate over an hour .
you gave him four .
what did you think of it ?
did you like it at all ?
i thought it was marvelous .
of course .
it' s the best opera yet written !
i know it .
why didn' t they come ?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese , my friend .
you didn' t even give them a good bang at the end of songs ... ... to tell them when to clap .
i know .
you should give me lessons in that .
i wouldn' t presume .
nevertheless , at the risk of imposing ... ... l' d like you to see my new piece .
it would be a tremendous honor for me .
no , the honor would be all mine .
i believe ... ... l believe ... ... it is the best opera ... ... yet written , my friends .
you are the brightest star ... ... in the musical firmament .
you do honor to vienna ... ... and to me .
it was good of you to come .
how could i not ?
bravo , maestro .
did my work please you ?
i never knew that music like that was possible .
you flatter me .
one hears such sounds ... ... and what can one say but ... ... salieri !
everybody' s here and we' ve got guests .
i' ve got some more .
you remember my good friend schikaneder .
come in !
don' t be shy .
this is ... ... a very nice girl , and this is too ....
yes , my love ?
these gentlemen are from salzburg .
we were just talking about salzburg .
your father is dead .
so rose ... ... the dreadful ghost , from his next ... ... and blackest opera .
there , on the stage , stood the figure of a dead commander .
and i knew ... ... only i understood ... ... that the horrifying apparition was leopold ... ... raised from the dead !
wolfgang had summoned up his own father ... ... to accuse his son before all the world !
it was ... ... terrifying and wonderful to watch .
and now ...
... the madness began in me .
the madness of a man splitting in half .
through my influence , i saw to it ... ... don giovanni was played only five times in vienna .
but , in secret , i went to every one of those five .
worshipping sound ... ... l alone seemed to hear .
as i stood there , understanding ... ... how that bitter old man still possessed his poor son ... ... even from beyond the grave ... ... l began to see a way ... ... a terrible way ... ... l could finally triumph ... ... over god .
i have come to commission work from you .
what work ?
a mass for the dead .
what dead ?
who' s dead ?
a man who deserved a requiem mass ... ... and never got one .
who are you ?
i am only a messenger .
do you accept ?
you' il be well paid .
do you accept ?
work fast .
and be sure to tell no one what you do .
you will see me again soon .
my plan was so simple ... ... that it terrified me .
first , i must get the death mass , and then ... ... l must achieve his death .
what ?
his funeral !
lmagine it !
the cathedral ... ... all vienna sitting there .
his coffin ... ... mozart' s little coffin in the middle .
and then ... ... in that silence ... ... music !
a divine music bursts out over them all .
a great mass of death .
requiem mass for wolfgang mozart .
composed by his devoted friend ... ... antonio salieri .
what sublimity !
what depth !
what passion in the music !
salieri has been touched by god at last ... ... and god forced to listen .
powerless to stop it !
i , for once , in the end , laughing at him !
the only thing that worried me ... ... was the actual killing .
how does one do that ?
how does one kill a man ?
it' s one thing ... ... to dream about it .
very different when you ... ... when you have to do it ... ... with your own hands .
come in !
i' ve come to dinner .
dinner !
are you mad ?
i' m a nobleman .
i only ever dine with people of my own height .
stop it !
be careful !
be careful !
hold tight !
i' m a famous ... ... horseman
and we' re a famous horsie
give me a hoof my darling
and i' il give you my heart
take me to your stable
and never more we' il part
kill me !
kill me !
we' re going to make a soprano stew
and when you make a soprano stew
shut up !
i' m sick to death of that tune !
give him some hay , my darling
and i' il give you my heart
leporello !
some hay !
we hope you' re contented
with what we' ve presented
and love our dove of peace
what did you think ?
wonderful !
he liked the little people .
it' s all in good fun .
i liked the horse .
i tell you , if you played don giovanni here ... ... you would have had a wonderful success .
you belong here !
not at the snobby court .
you could do anything you like .
the more fantastic , the better .
that' s what people want : fantasy !
you write a proper part for me and a couple of catchy songs ... ... l guarantee you a triumph deluxe !
what do you say ?
how much will you pay him ?
i see you brought your manager with you .
well , madame ... ... how about ... ... half the receipts ?
half the receipts !
i' m talking about now .
how much will you pay him now ?
down payment .
down payment ?
who do you think i am , the emperor ?
i have to go .
stay , you' il enjoy this .
you won' t do this .
why not ?
half the house !
when ?
we need money now !
either he pays you now , or you don' t do it .
i don' t trust that man .
and i don' t like what he did with your opera .
it was common .
you liked it .
monkey , punky , flunky !
half the house !
you' il never see a penny .
i want it here in my hand .
i' il put it here in your hand .
you won' t put a thing in my hand until i see some money !
it' s embarrassing .
can' t you think of anyone who can do something for him ?
i ' m afraid mozart is a lost cause , baron .
he has succeeded in alienating practically the whole of vienna .
he never pays his debts .
i can ' t think of anyone to whom i' d dare recommend him .
herr mozart .
what a surprise !
what can i do for you ?
is my pupil still interested in learning the art of music ?
your pupil is married and living in mannheim , young man .
really ?
perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction .
what is it , mozart ?
what' s the matter with you ?
well . . . . . . since it appears no one is eager to hire my services . . .
. . . could you favor me with a little money instead ?
what for ?
if a man cannot earn , he must borrow .
that' s hardly the way to go about it .
you are right , sir .
you are right .
but you see , i am endowed with talent , and you with money .
if i offer mine . . . . . . you should offer yours .
i' m sorry , no .
please .
my answer is no , mozart .
please .
please !
don' t answer it .
why ?
tell him i' m not here .
tell him i' m working on it .
come back later .
am i interrupting something ?
no .
good .
where' s our friend ?
he' s not here .
but he said he' s working on it .
is that it ?
is he happy with it ?
what' s this ?
a requiem mass ?
you think i' m in the funeral business ?
put it down !
put it down !
put it down , it' s nothing for you !
i' m sorry .
what have you got for me ?
finished ?
what ?
the vaudeville , what do you think ?
yes .
can i see it ?
no .
why not ?
because there' s nothing to see .
i asked you if we could start rehearsals next week and you said yes .
we can .
so let me see it .
where is it ?
here .
it' s all right here in my noodle .
the rest is just scribbling .
scribbling and bibbling , bibbling and scribbling .
want a drink ?
do you know how many people i' ve hired for you ?
leave him alone !
i' m paying these people !
he' s doing his best .
i' m paying them to wait for you .
it' s ridiculous !
you know what' s ridiculous ?
your libretto' s ridiculous !
only an idiot would ask wolfie to work on that !
12 foot snakes , magic flutes ?
what' s so intelligent about a requiem ?
money .
you' re mad .
she' s mad .
wolfie , write it down .
just write it down .
on paper .
it' s no use to anybody in your head .
to hell with your death mass !
calm yourself .
what' s the matter with you ?
i' m not working there anymore .
what has happened ?
you don' t know what it' s like .
herr mozart frightens me .
he drinks all day ... ... then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse .
is he working ?
i' m frightened , sir , really !
when he speaks he makes no sense .
is he working ?
i suppose so .
he sits there all the time , doing some silly opera .
please , don' t ask me to go back again .
i' m frightened .
i' m very , very frightened !
are you sure it' s an opera ?
i don' t have it yet .
are you neglecting my request ?
i promise you .
i' il give you the best piece i ever
this is my wife .
i' ve been sick but i' m all right now , aren' t i ?
yes , sir .
he' s all right .
and he' s working on it very hard .
two more weeks .
please .
the sooner you finish , the greater your reward .
work !
i think you really are going mad .
you work like a slave for that idiot actor who won' t give you a penny !
and here ....
this is not a ghost !
this is a real man who puts down real money .
why on earth won' t you finish it ?
can you give me one reason i can understand ?
it' s killing me .
you' re drunk , aren' t you ?
be honest , tell me .
you' ve been drinking .
it' s not fair .
i worry about you all the time .
i do everything i can to help you .
and all you do is drink and talk nonsense , and frighten me .
go to bed !
please .
let me sit here .
let me stay here with you .
i did it !
and i was proud to do it .
leave , i said !
right away !
and take the child with you !
here' s the money !
go to the spa ... ... and get your health back .
i was shocked ... ... shocked to my foundation when i saw her .
i couldn' t believe my eyes , poor little thing .
you monster !
no one exists but you , do they ?
you and your music .
i warned her .
choose a man , not a baby , " i said .
you marry him , you won' t have a pot to piss in .
you selfish thing !
selfish , that' s what you are .
selfish .
simply selfish !
do you hear me ?
pick him up .
be careful !
come with me !
you !
follow me .
is it over ?
yes , it' s over .
it' s over .
go !
go !
where is your wife ?
where is your wife ?
she' s not well either .
she went to the spa .
you are so good to me .
truly .
thank you .
please !
no , i mean , to come to my opera .
you are the only colleague of mine who came .
i would never miss anything you had written .
it' s just a vaudeville .
it' s a sublime piece .
the grandest operone !
i tell you ... ... you are the greatest composer known to me .
do you mean it ?
it' s him !
the man .
he' s here .
tell him to go away .
tell him i' m still working on it .
don' t let him in .
wait !
ask him if he would give me some money now .
tell him it will help me finish .
can we come in ?
better not .
he' s sleeping .
he' s all right ?
yes , he' s just exhausted .
he became dizzy .
that' s all .
tell him we came by , won' t you ?
of course .
give him this .
that' s his share .
that should cheer him up .
indeed !
and now good night to you all .
it was ... ... perfection .
truly !
thank you .
what happened ?
he said to give you this .
and if you finish by tomorrow ... ... he' il pay 100 ducats more .
that' s too soon !
tomorrow night ....
it' s impossible !
did he say 100 ?
it' s too soon !
could i help you ?
would you ?
actually , you could .
i want to go !
where ?
back to vienna .
now ?
yes .
why ?
i feel wrong .
i feel wrong being here .
where did i stop ?
the end of the recordare .
so .
now , confutatis ... ... when the wicked are confounded .
how would you translate that ?
consigned to flames of woe .
you believe in it ?
a fire which never dies , burning you forever .
yes .
is it possible ?
let' s begin .
we ended in f major .
so now ... ... a minor .

no , wolfie , not this .
you' re not to work on this ever again .
i' ve decided .
it' s not his handwriting .
no , it' s mine .
i was assisting him .
he' s not to work on this anymore .
it' s making him ill .
good night .
i regret we have no servants to show you out , herr salieri .
respect my wish and go .
i will respect his .
your merciful god .
he destroyed his own beloved ... ... rather than let a mediocrity ... ... share in the smallest part of his glory .
he killed mozart .
and kept me alive to torture .
32 years of torture .
32 years ... ... of slowly watching myself become extinct !
my music ... ... growing fainter .
all the time fainter ... ... till no one plays it at all .
and his ....
good morning !
time for the water closet .
then we have your favorite breakfast .
sugar rolls !
he loves those .
fresh sugar rolls .
i will speak for you , father .
i speak for all mediocrities in the world .
i am their champion .
i am their patron saint .
mediocrities everywhere ... ... i absolve you .
i absolve you .
i absolve you all .
