i don' t want anything to do with these freaks .
i am here to see mr. wellington , and i' m not leaving until i see him .
allow me to speak to mr. wellington .
yes , you let him know i' m here .
mr. sklar , sir ?
yeah , cisco ?
it' s , uh , miss jenkins again , sir .
she insists on seeing mr. wellington .
i' m sorry to bust in like this .
well , actually i' m not .
that' s her .
that' s the girl .
hey , remember me ?
on the bike .
run over ?
no , that' s allright , miss jenkins .
so , what can we do for you ?
well , i just wanted to say that i think that you should be arrested .
holy crap .
what you' re planning to do to the brooklyn community hospital is downright criminal .
oh , so you mean that
you throw those words around like that .
arrested . " it kind of hit me .
that really ooh !
i don' t think there' s anything funny about this .
i work at the brooklyn community hospital .
and it' s the only public health facility in the area , and your company just bought it .
i know that hospital .
my uncle went there for a new liver .
they sent his ass to the supermarket .
if this hospital goes private , the people who depend on us ... they won' t have any place to turn .
that' s awful .
i think you should take that up ... with mr. wellington at his business office .
i' ve tried that .
i' ve been there at least 20 times .
i' ve made 200 phone calls , and mr. wellington seems to never be in , so i decided to visit him at his home .
well , he' s unavailable , i guarantee you .
if he' s unavailable now , i' il just wait here until he is available .
i' m afraid you can' t .
yes , i can .
would you like to call the police and have me arrested ?
i' m sure the press' il be interested in the story .
no , no , no .
let' s don' t .
let' s don' t even  i thought so .
hey , king , if i take this wellington guy' s body , could i help her out ?
you got the hots for her .
you tryin ' to sell me a body , right ?
well , let' s see it .
okay .
would you stop it ?
this ain' t star trek .
i' m used to walking .
lance barton , charles wellington .
mr. wellington , please , don' t get up .
damn , he' s dead !
yep .
nice bathtub .
so if i take his body , i' m gonna look like that , right ?
i can' t go to the apollo in that body .
how am i supposed to get laughs lookin ' like him ?
he looks funny to me .
i already get booed .
do i really need to get beat down on top of it ?
you want to meet the girl , you gotta take the body .
any moment someone' il discover it , and it' il be too late .
does it have to be for good ?
could i just be him while you find me a better body ?
you mean , take the body on loan ?
mm hmm .
normally , i have a problem with that , but since we , uh , screwed up ,
it' s a deal .
mr. wellington , there' s a miss sontee jenkins here to see you .
still bathing , are we ?
we don' t want our fingers to go all pruney .
hey , it worked !
what ?
you weren' t sure it would work ?
relax , i read the manual .
hey , i still look like me .
you are you .
i thought you said i was wellington .
you are wellington .
well , thanks for clearin ' that up .
look , lance , to everyone else ... you look like wellington , you sound like wellington , you even smell like wellington .
but you see yourself .
simple , huh ?
mr. wellington , is everything allright ?
go ahead .
you can answer him .
go ahead .
everything' s cool .
not too cool , i hope .
no , everything is all right .

me ?
i am talking about people' s lives here , mr. wellington .
sick people , poor people .
the kind of people that you care nothing about .
these people are going to be in desperate trouble ... if you sell them out from the only place they can go when they need help .
see you later , lance .
i' il get keyes workin ' on a new body .
good luck .
hey , but  but nothing !
do you know that we are the only county hospital in that part of brooklyn ?
and you chose there of all places ... to privatize and kick sick , broke people out on their behinds .
what kind of man are you ?
it sounds like i' m an asshole .

i thought maybe we could ... get in the rolls and go by the four seasons , have a little brunch , discuss this whole hospital thing .
oh , so you' re trying to impress me with the car and the money .
you think i' m some video ho ?
look , i really don' t care what you have , okay ?
if you want to impress me , do it at the board meeting on monday .
i thought maybe we could spend some time together .
why don' t you spend a little time and do something positive with your money ?
that was brutal .
you got a nice touch with the ladies .
i can' t get a girl in this body , and i definitely can' t get any laughs .
have you found me anything yet ?
i' m workin ' on it .
i was just in havana .
you want one ?
no , i don' t want one .
what i want from you is a body that works .
i want a body , and i want it now !
what , are you gettin ' tough with me ?
i' m a friggin ' angel .
you don' t want to be in heaven , you don' t like it here .
there is a third option , you know .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i just need a body .
you know what ?
there' s a big rap concert in the bronx tonight .
somebody' s gonna die .
hey , don' t forget about me .

it' s over between you and me .
i can' t do this anymore .
let' s just get out of here .
we could take the plane .
we could go someplace he' il never find us .
chechnya , east timor .
it' il be fun .
no , i can' t .
i mean , after all , he is my husband , and i love him .
and i' m gonna do whatever i can to get him back .
bitch !
scaming , double crossing bitch !
that' s sweet , winston , but it' s too late .
we cannot allow wellco to take over !
i just think this is an extremely bad time ... to be making a personal appearance .
i' ve been lookin ' into this hospital thing , and i think sontee jenkins had a point
let' s just handle this the usual way , okay ?
you do the strong , silent thing .
i' il field all the questions .
i' m the velvet glove .
you' re the iron fist .
i won' t let you down .
we can' t have that .
no !
there' s one man that' s responsible for all this charles wellington .
you' re a bad man !
get outta here !
leave our hospital alone !
scumbag !
white oppressor !
mr. wellington , now that you own brooklyn community hospital , are you gonna be sending those without health insurance ... to public facilities outside their own community ?
yeah , asshole !
mr. wellington doesn' t have time ... to answer any questions right now .
let me address that .
i don' t care what you got .
cancer , rickets , polio , swine flu , the clap , dandruff
what else you got ?
lyme disease .
lyme disease , lemon disease .
it don' t matter .
we' il take you .
liar !
won' t take you .
mr. wellington , is the
thank you .
thank you all .
well , here they are , mr. wellington , the faces that you were too much of a coward to confront .
so what do you have to say to them ?
hey , what' s up , wheelie ?
crutchie crutch , how you doin ' , man ?
hey , big i. v. save me a sip .
i want a sip , now .
i know what' s wrong with you .
your breath is destroying the environment .
why don' t you tell them that you don' t care about them ?
while you' re at it , how come you locked the staff and press out of this meeting ?
you know what ?
i must' ve been out of my mind .
was i takin ' ecstasy that day ?
we goin ' in there .
sklar , grab a stretcher .
we' re goin ' in .
everybody .
allright !
if you can walk , let' s walk .
if you can' t walk , it' s time to roll .
if you got crutches , then crutch your ass in there .
we are goin ' in .
come on , big i. v. let' s do this .
whoo .
sorry , brother .
can we get some more juice for big i. v. ?
hey , guys , i brought us some friends from the media .
so if anybody is not where they' re supposed to be ... or with somebody they' re not supposed to be with ... or got a little crust in their eyes , you might want to get up right now .
you can' t bring news cameras into the boardroom .
hey , relax .
we got nothing to hide .
if there' s not enough seats , you can just sit on somebody' s lap , unless the person next to you don' t got a lap .
so , what' s up ?
mr. wellington , at your hospital in kentucky , a teenager with a bullet wound to his head was sent to another hospital ... 15 miles away , dying en route .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
hospitals don' t kill people .
people kill people .
what kind of cold ass shit is that ?
we can' t be sendin ' people out with bullet wounds to their head .
that' s somethin ' you definitely have to take serious .
from now on , we got a new slogan .
shot in the head , you get a bed ! " .
okay ?
if your head is bloody , we' re your buddy .
i want bullet wounds in this place to be treated like cash accepted everywhere .
but not without adequate insurance .
not without adequate insurance .
is insurance really adequate ?
when you pay for insurance , do you feel assured ?
they shouldn' t even call it insurance .
they should just call it " in case shit " .
i give a company some money in case shit happens .
now , if shit don' t happen , shouldn' t i get my money back ?
wouldn' t that be fair ?
if i had known y' all was gonna keep the money , i would' ve got in an accident .
and if you' re gonna take my money , at least spend the money on some poor , sick people .
don' t take my money and buy a mercedes benz ... and park it in front of brooklyn hospital ... with all these broke people gotta walk by it .
i just got off the b 44 bus , and i got to look at your mercedes benz ?
i should just stab the tire !
and why do doctors cost so much ?
do you know ?
shut the hell up !
it' s like doctors chargin ' all this money for a triple bypass surgery .
triple bypass surgery gonna charge somebody $100, 000 ... and then got the nerve to say , " take it easy .
shit , i gotta go get a job right now drivin ' another cab or somethin ' ... just to pay off the damn doctor !
from now on , we have to be different .
let' s see how it feels to not be the evil corporation anymore .
let' s try takin ' in people bleedin ' with bullet wounds to the head .
let' s just try it for a change .
i mean , we tried the other way .
we made a lot of money .
we got paid .
we got laid .
and so what if we lose a few million dollars ?
now , a lot of y' all look pretty pissed off .
look like y' all want to get froggy .
well , come on !
what you gonna do ?
uh uh .
you see this foot ?
you see this foot ?
it' s from a little town called " rich man' s ass " , and it' s gettin ' homesick .
you guys have been great .
you' ve been a lovely audience .
i want to thank y' all for showin ' up .
drive home safely .
tip your waitresses .
i gots to go .
take care .
thanks a lot .
thank you .

what are you , the great gazoo ?
sorry .
hi .
how are you ?
i got a new body for you .
i don' t need the body anymore .
this one' s just fine .
mr. barton , we have about one minute to get you into this truly fabulous corpse .
hey , i' m cool with wellington .
you know why ?
' cause sontee' s cool with wellington .
look , i just waited through ol ' dirty bastard , mystikal and silkk the shocker for you .
keeping this body is not an option , regardless of whether you' re smitten with some girl .
it' s not some girl .
it' s the girl .
i mean , you got heaven , but you don' t got this , man .
she' s fine .
she' s smart .
we like all the same stuff .
we hate all the same stuff .
she laughs at my stupid jokes .
and i don' t have to censor myself around her .
but you know what ?
she only knows me as this guy wellington .
so i don' t want to up and change now .
lance , trust me , it' s better this way .
yo , money , gimme your wallet .
one second .
are you sure i won' t die for 40 years ?
technically , yes  mother
but this body' s just a loaner !
boy , nobody listens to me .
come on , man !
rob me !
don' t run !
i got money !
you bad !
what does that mean , he wants to be more involved with running the company ?
it means , uh ... he wants to be more involved ... with , uh , running ... the company .
i thought you had him under control .
i do .
i mean , i did .
i don' t really know where this came from .
it' s like he' s gone crazy .
maybe the fact you were shtupping his wife changed his attitude a little .
there' s really no need to get , uh , personal .
i' il tell you what i take personally : the statement , " what if we lose a few million dollars ?
i didn' t get into this business to lose money .
do you think this goody two shoes crap that wellington' s been spewing ... extends to , say , auditing the company' s finances ?
jesus , i hope not .
blah , blah , blah .
let' s just kill him .
what are you laughing about ?
winston , do you want to take the lead on this one ?
cisco , you know what i need you to do ?
i need you to get in contact with a man named whitney daniels .
he lives on 104th and lennox .
tell him i need to talk to him .
uh
pretty sweet , huh ?
up here , mr. daniels .
entering second floor .
yeah .
yeah , yeah .
i saw this girl the other day .
she was ugly .
she' s so ugly , she' s talkin ' about give her a booty call .
i said , " girl , you so ugly , i' m gonna give you a zootie call .
what the hell do you think you' re doing here , huh ?
this isn' t your act .
calm down .
hey , hey , hey !
everybody , whitney daniels !
shut up !
you guys have been great , but we' re gonna take a little break right now .
all right .
come on , everybody .
let' s get back to work .
come on .
what the hell is going on here ?
i know it looks kind of crazy , but if i' m gonna get ... an amateur spots at the apollo , i' m gonna need a place to work out .
y you wanna do one of the amateur spots at the apollo ?
you ?
what do you do , have your butlers ... hang around comedy clubs and steal people' s acts ?
you think my act is stolen ?
i know it is .
personally , i would have stolen some better material .
but the kid who wrote it , he used to work it pretty well and
two rheingolds comin ' at ya .
thanks a lot , cisco .
damn , you took everything from the kid , huh ?
don' t tell me that rheingold is all you can afford , mr. wellington .
whit , i didn' t steal anything .
i just want to play the apollo , and you' re the only man who can help me do it .
no .
i' m out of the comedy business .
last person i was gonna help is dead .
but , anyway , he was a special case .
really ?
what was so special about him ?
about him ?
nothin ' , really , if you want to know .
he didn' t have much talent to speak of .
but no matter how bad it went and , believe me , sometimes it went really bad he wanted to get back onstage .
he was a good kid .
and i wanted to be there when things got good for him , but
but i guess that won' t happen now .
thanks for the beer .
whitney , it' s me lance .
uh i got hit by a truck , and i went up to heaven , and they took my body quick .
and i' m in heaven , and it' s all blue .
and this guy and then the other guy , mr. king , he looked like ricky ricardo and
i don' t know if it' s drugs you' re takin ' or drugs you need to be takin ' , but do something .
whitney , remember when we did that gig in atlantic city ?
they were supposed to pay us 500 , but they only gave us 250 .
and we got real drunk and hung out with these two girls .
we got so drunk , we thought they was transvestites .
turns out they weren' t transvestites .
they were just two real ugly girls .
then we brought ' em back to the hotel , hung out with ' em , fell asleep .
when we woke up , what did we find out ?
they robbed us !
yeah , man !
they
booey !
yeah !
whoo !
th this is impossible .
what' s so impossible about it ?
you been going to church your whole life .
you' ve been putting money in the collection plate every week .
this is just your tax dollars at work .
wait a minute .
god
what' s god like ?
does he have a sense of humor ?
i haven' t met god , but the devil got some good weed .
i' m just joking .
just playin ' , man .
i haven' t even met him yet , but i met this guy , mr. king .
he' s kind of like the manager up there .
manager ?
wait
lance .
just because you built a comedy club in your own home , it doesn' t mean you can pull this off .
you gotta work your material in front of a real audience .
i got an audience .
you heard me gettin ' laughs .
you ain' t my type but i think i like you
doin ' just fine but i think i like you
you ain' t the right height but i think i like you
wasn' t love at first sight but i think i like you
they say you' re kinda rude but i think i like you
i don' t like your crew but i think i like you
what else do we got ?
your mother has so much hair under her arms , it looks like she has buckwheat in a headlock .
i don' t know why but i think i like you
you ain' t my type but i think i like you
you know what i like about telling jokes ?
it' s pure .
it' s like boxing 101 .
you versus the audience .
it' s not like music .
nobody cares what you look like .
nobody cares what you' re wearing .
people just want to know if you' re funny .
can you bring it ?
and i just wanna go to the apollo and bring it one time .
what about that stuff you were saying at the hospital ?
people think that stuff every day , but you never hear anybody say it .
i was just talkin ' .
yeah , but it worked .
what do you mean , worked ?
it was funny .

no one makes these rules .
but you make all the mistakes .
every time i get something going , you take my body .
this was just a temporary setup .
the clock ran out .
i' m not scared of you , king .
i got lawyers now .
i got money .
makes no difference .
but i can' t go now .
i' m supposed to play the apollo , and i' m in love .
this is bigger than that .
nothin' s bigger than that .
this is fate .
how come every time something bad happens to me , it' s fate , and every time something good happens to me , it' s luck ?
is anything good supposed to happen to me ?
no .
somebody call 9 1 1 !
sorry , lance .
i tried to warn you .

i just can' t believe he' s gone , just like that .
he' s not gone , sontee .
i know in a way he' s gonna live on , but

you think you loved charles wellington , but really you loved someone inside of him .
he didn' t die tonight .
he' s living on somewhere .
i' m sure of it .
and he' il always remember us .
so what are we doin ' here ?
this is your future , kid .
you mean i' m gonna be joe guy ?
that' s the plan .
i don' t want to take his life .

people , all they care about is your looks .
i' m sorry , if you look good , you' re gonna have a good life .
you look bad , ooh , you better work on it .
that' s right , the uglier you are , the smarter you better be .
for every ten pounds you are overweight , you better pick up a book .

women can fall in love with a ugly man and admit it .

you wanna be in love .
you want that new love .
you want you want to feel that first kiss again .

that' s all it is , just routine .
hey !
you was gone .

hey , i miss you .
it' s all routine .
the first kiss is the only real one ...
