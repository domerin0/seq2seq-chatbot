they look like soldiers .
what do you want ?
this can' t be .
what does that mean ?
producer : lsao kurosu
atsushi muroga
i saw that he was really suffering .
cool !
i walked out on him immediately , of course .
and now i' m working really hard on having a good relationship soon .
i' m so happy that i got rid of him .
don' t let that kind fool you , girls !
poor guy !
he really is to be pitied .
but now to something different .
we have another listener' s request .
it comes from satomi kinjo from urasan .
and her wish is " pit in " with " a few dance more " .
get down , everybody !
he said , get down !
freeze !
hey ! lf you want to stay alive you' d better be a good boy !
this is no toy , understand ? !
hello ?
hello , this is sawaki from happy motors speaking .
can i help you ?
sorry , but i' m very busy now .
i' il call you back later .
please wait , there is ...
hello ?
well ...
we' d just like to know whether you' re taking the car or not .
there are quite a lot of customers who are really interested in this model ...
i' il take it .
i' il call you back !
it hurts !
step on !
it hurts like hell !
what happened ?
this fucking idiot managed to get caught by a woman ...
i think she' s dead .
dead ?
did you shoot her ?
otherwise i would be dead now .
but did you really have to kill her ? !
she' s alive .
i didn' t aim at her precious parts intentionally .
there is no turning back anyway .
right ?
and what about me ? !
i' m wounded !
shut up , you idiot !
don' t worry .
the wound isn' t that deep .
just keep calm .
liar !
it hurts like hell !
well , of course it hurts a bit ...
not only a bit !
well ?
how did things go ?
child' s play ...
child' s play ? !
you fucking idiot !
akira !
it' s not that bad .
when we have the money , you can afford your own private nude nurse !
don' t you dare lie to me !
of course not !
we' il sell them , right ?
yeah , don' t worry about it .
i already took care of that .
hello ?
just a moment , please .
this is our man .
ramon speaking ...
ah , it' s you .
i' ve been waiting for your call .
did things work out well ?
sure , everything is perfect .
the rocks are worth about 100 . 000 . 000 yen .
great .
but before talking about prices , i want to see the goods .
but i' il be prepared to pay the 100 . 000 . 000 in cash .
is that so ?
do you agree to talk about the price right now ?
okay .
our meeting place ...
take the 58 westward , than you' il arrive at an old factory site .
we' il meet there .
an old factory site ?
good idea .
that' s an adequate place !
okay .
we' il need about ...
one hour .
we' il be there in an hour .
we' il be waiting for you ...
wow !
100 . 000 . 000 yen !
100 . 000 . 000 yen !!
25 . 000 . 000 for every one of us !
i can finally buy me a porsche !
we made it , akira !
feels like a dream .
won' t there be any difficulties at our meeting place ?
no .
this is no residential area , the police shows up quite seldom .
extremely rarely .
i know for sure that there isn' t anybody around now .
is that so ?
if the stuff is good it' s worth driving all the way out there .
here is the money .
quite a good deal ...
okay .
let' s go .
that' s impossible !
then do something !
oh my god ...
here ?
i guess so .
you can' t conclude a deal like that in the middle of the town , can you ?
but the yakuzas complete their deals in chinese restaurants , don' t they ?
shut up !
when we have the money , you can eat chinese every fucking day .
hello , this is happy motors .
our name stands for confidence and service .
yeah .
what can i do for you ?
yeah .
i' m sorry , but i was really busy when i received your call .
because of the car ...
what ? !
well , we already sold it to some other client .
of course you were top of the list , that' s why i called you immediately .
but you simply hung up ...
wait !
i told you that i would take it !
that' s easy to say ...
i' il pay in cash .
just do something !
maybe there is still something that i can do for you ...
you' re lucky , my other client hasn' t signed the bill of sale yet .
in that case , my comission would rise a bit , of course ...
how much ? !
wait !
you' re trying to rip me off , aren' t you ?
i see .
i' il come to your shop tomorrow morning and drop in the money .
okay ? !
bye !
asshole !
was that her ?
child' s play !
after all , these babies were invented to make you rich , weren' t they ?
you' re the greatest !
the car seller cheated you , didn' t he ?
leave me alone .
i didn' t know that you are so mad about cars ...
i' m mad about fast cars in combination with loud music .
in my car , i expect women to stay on the passenger seat ...
i' m fed up with being the passenger .
i' ve found this completely unsatisfactory .
because you' ve climbed into the wrong cars ...
men are all the same anyway !
what' s up ?
if you don' t stop this , you' il be dead before you' ve spent your money !
but my foot hurts !
you have to clean the wound .
you' re acting like a doctor .
i' m a nurse .
really ?
yes .
i used to work at a big hospital in tokyo .
one of the doctors was always trying to paw me , that' s why i quit .
did he try it in the car ?
oh doctor !
please don' t !
we need some more water .
hey !
should i tell you how you can get a really cheap car ?
how ?
i' ve changed my mind .
it wouldn' t work with a women' s libber like you anyhow .
i see !
presumably the total value of the stolen jewellery is ... more than 100 . 000 . 000 yen .
an employee of the jeweller' s shop ... was seriously injured during the raid .
she was put in a hospital , but she' s still in a coma .
here' s the weather forecast ...
how do i look ?
as a gangster , you have to keep an eye on your outfit ...
who is that ramon anyway ?
probably a yakuza .
but i' ve been told that he pays really good for hot stuff .
but can we trust him ?
don' t shit on yourself , kabu .
everything' s just fine .
everything is going well .
my plan has turned out to be absolutely perfect .
seems like it .
are you still planning to go to the philippines ?
yeah , that' s right .
in this country , there seems to be no place for me ...
they' re still after you because of that immoveables thing , right ?
i' m looking for a water pipe .
we have to clean akira' s wound .
that' s not necessary !
we should have bought some bandages .
allright , i' m off .
no !
you scared me to death !
did you find water ?
i think i saw something over there .
really ?
wait !
what' s up ?
do you have a weakness for akira by any chance ?
what does that mean ?
the way you' re taking care of him ...
like you' re having a little carry on .
bullshit !
there' s one thing you shouldn' t forget ...
it was me who got you into this .
because of me ... you' il earn quite a lot of money .
so what ?
i think you' d better take care of me .
i' il be very kind to you ...
we can kill these two idiots and go fifty fifty , if you want to .
i' m different than those guys .
and one fine day ...
i' il be very rich .
come on ...
be my little sweetheart ...
leave me alone !
are you lesbian ?
if i was your girlfriend , i' d probably turn into one ...
stupid bitch !
kabu ?
kabu , is that you ?
what was that ?
that was jun' s voice !
what happened ?
upstairs !
is it the cops ?
look at that .
what kind of a factory is this anyhow ?
looks like a chemical factory .
what' s that ?
corpses !
what is this place ?
maybe the secret mortuary of the yakuza ...
nonsense !
where' s jun ?
look ... !
you monsters !!
hey !
what the fuck is going on here ? !
they are possibly zombies !
living dead !
they' re still alive !
how is such a thing possible ?
no idea !
let' s get out of here !
these creatures are hiding somewhere !
i don' t want to be eaten !
let' s clear off !
i was so worried because you didn' t stay by your car ...
are you ramon ?
are you jun ?
i heard a shot .
what happened ?
jun is dead .
he got killed .
killed ?
what does that mean ?
there' s nothing more to say .
that monster ate him !
what ?
there are zombies around here .
zombies ?
joking apart .
after all , we' re here to talk business ...
that' s no joke .
we have to get out of here !
we can talk business somewhere else .
no .
we' il stay here .
this place is teeming with zombies !
they already caught one of us !
i see ...
you killed jun to increase your share .
not bad ...
what are you talking about ?
relax .
okay .
give us a look ...
where' s the money ?
marvellous .
really excellent .
not bad , if i consider that you' re no pros ...
how much ?
well ...
the price will be high ...
what does that mean ?
you bastard !
if you go home like good boys and girls , you' il stay alive ...
you can' t do that !
you fucking bastard !
kabu , don' t !
kabu !
what about you ?
i' m sorry ...
well ?
what are you going to do now ?
you' d better give up .
isn' t this place full of zombies ?
you' d better go home , otherwise they might kill you .
help ... !
fuck you .
all of you !
what' s that ? !
jun ...
come on !

you son of a bitch !
what' s going on here ? !
what are you waiting for ?

he really is a zombie ...

don' t let them get away !
quick !

they caught kabu , too !
what do we do now ? !
jun ...
he' s alive ...
that' s not jun anymore !
what about the jewellery ?
they' re going to steel them !
no idea !
i' m wounded !
you idiot !
that' s why i hate men !
asshole !
come on !
what is this place ?
let' s go !
i' il kill you !
akira !
saki !
oh shit !
hey !
can anybody hear me ?
what' s up ?
come here at once !
i' m right under the stairs !
what happened ?
hurry !
let go of me !
that was ramon' s voice !
these monsters have guzzled him .
he' s bound to be still in here .
we have to get the jewellery back .
we have to get out of here !
could you give me just one reason why you' re here ?
don' t make such a fuss !
a real man would go straight out there and fight !
all you' re doing is wailing !
two of our friends are dead .
don' t you have any balls ? !
allright .
let' s go !
i have to .
oh my god ... !
this way !
oh no ... !
we' re lost !
we found him ...
let' s clear off !
fuck it ...
saki !
saki !

saki !
come on !!
come on !!
don' t let go of me !
saki !
saki !!
akira ...
shit !
what are these army guys doing here ?
help !!
what' s happening here ?
help me !!
are you okay ?
who ...
who are you ?
what are you doing here ?
get up .
the whole place is going to explode in a minute .
explode ?
i' il destroy them .
good idea ...
an eye witness told the police that he saw a white van on the scene of crime .
the police closed off several roads hoping to locate this vehicle .
shit !
did you create these zombies ?
i never wanted to create a monster .
because of them , my friends are dead now .
and i won' t get my porsche either !
one of them is very intelligent .
what ?
that' s not a normal zombie .
he' s really clever .
he managed to deactivate the bomb .
hello ?
saki ? !
hello , akira ?
hello ?
hello !
hello ?
where are you ? !
saki !
what a fucking asshole !
i knew it .
takashi !
kyoko ...
i wanted you to live again .
i couldn' t think of anything else .
takashi ?
you died two years ago .
you died in a car accident .
no .
you may not live ..
takashi ...
you monster ...
shit !
are you okay ?
we must get out of here !
give me the key .
here it is .
you have to leave now .
i' il activate the self destruction mode .
that' s impossible !
you' re wounded !
if i don' t blow up the lab , they' il take possession of the whole town .
this woman ...
she' s my wife .
what ?
i took part in the generation of a revolutionary medicine .
i wanted to raise my wife from the dead .
but it went all wrong .
i' m so sorry that i' ve dragged you into this .
actually i' m on the run because i robbed a jeweller' s shop ...
i see .
take this .
you can handle it , can' t you ?
goodbye .
you fucking bitch !!
are you okay ? !
let' s go !
wait .
what are you doing there ?
i' m going to blow this joint .
the army researched on those zombies ? !
that' s it .
let' s go !
you' d better go back to your husband ...
oh shit !
this way !
that' s insane !!
are you allright ?
look !
they' re in good health , too .
there he comes .
what a sound ...
there' s nothing better than a porsche !
porsche ... ?
this car ...
a great car !
what does that mean ?
i called the shop .
we can' t use the old van anymore .
sorry that i' ve kept you waiting for so long .
i' d like to thank you for choosing one of our models .
i' il bring you the vehicle documents !
how did you do that ?
if you pay double the amount , they bring it anywhere you like ...
double ? !
i simply need your signature ...
now you just have to pay the car .
double , as we agreed upon .
and what do we do now ?
i' ve promised you to show you how .
what ?
how to get a cheap and brand new car .
3 to 4 percent can be taken for granted ...
but this way we get it at 100 percent discount .
after all we' re gangsters , aren' t we ?
so what ?
driver or passenger ?
cool !
hey baby !
what about you and me ?
come on , jump in !
here we go !
