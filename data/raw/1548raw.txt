might get a silver star out of this patrol yet .
just have coors plot it out .
gunners mate standing by , sir .
stow the weapons .
they' re british .
... you can tell that from here ? ... it' s the sail .

don' t they teach you that in ocs , ensign ?
afraid not , but i can recite the submariners ' motto in latin .
radar contact ... starboard beam , seven miles out , sir .
god damn it !
what if they see us ?
well , they' re pouring on the coal for somebody .
all ahead ... emergency .
rudder to midship .

one' s a woman , eh ?
hey , look lively .
woman onboard .
hey , hoag , spread the news ... three tea bags , and i hear one' s , uh , bazooma .
we got ourselves a filly ?
ohh !
sweet holy jesus .
you' re gonna wanna hear this .
hey , boys ... here' s the news .
front page ... we got three redcoats , and guess what .
one of them' s a bleeder .
aw , great .
that' s all this boat needs ... another piece of rotten luck .
yeah , well , if it means you guys finally wash the butt squirt outta your shorts ,
i' m all for it .
so what exactly happened to your shi ...
um ... your ship ?
hospital ship .
we were attacked two nights ago .
two nights ?
i' m ...
i' m sorry .
my brain' s a bit foggy .
although i' m reasonably sure my name' s claire page .
the rest of the details will emerge , i' m sure .
that' s just a whale .
it' s okay , really .
the sounds down here still get to me , too .
make a hole .
comin ' through .
make a hole .
yow .
mind your pretty toes .
best iookin ' bad luck i ever saw .
doesn' t look good , sir .
why don' t you get those clothes off of him and see if you can get a better look at the wounds ?
i can dress the wounds .
other than that , i think it' s best to leave him be .
okay .
all right .
maybe i didn' t make myself clear .
i saw it .
it crossed the moon' s reflection just before the explosion .
yes , it was dark , but i ...
i did see it .
it wasn' t a mine .
i it was a u boat .
what class ?
type 7 ?
was it an older boat or one of their newer ones ?
um ...
like this ?
clean at the bow ? ... you know ... ... no net cutter ?
it was just a couple of seconds .
i really couldn' t say for ...
so you were ... you were on lookout that night , mister ...
kingsley ... second mate , merchant navy .
uh , no .
i was on the starboard deck grabbing a gasper .
having a cigarette .
and how many aboard your ship ?
about 300 patients .
at least that many .
out of north africa .
yeah , plus over 70 hands crew .
so , um ...
you said they fired only one torpedo ?
o' dell ... you better tell sonar we' ve got an enemy sub in the area .
yes , sir .
just let me finish ...
now .
do it now .
yes , sir .
i' m ...
i' m sorry that we couldn' t save more .
i ...
now this ... the third member of your party , he' s ...
one of my patients .
well , under normal circumstances ,
i' d be able to drop you at the nearest port in england , but , uh , it' s a 300 mile detour for us .
so i' m sorry .
it seems as though we' re stuck with each other .
oh , uh , last thing .
just try not to fraternize with the men .
most of the men are fine , but some of them get a little strange about having ...
strange " as in " superstitious " ?
as in " strange .
suddenly , his heart rolled over backwards in his chest ,
and he saw this huge , wretched thing before him .
i nstantly , its mouth widened
into a terrible and hungry menace .
now the malediction uttered a deep throated sound . " ... malediction ? ... look it up .
and its breath stank gloriously
of rotted carp and matted gorilla skins .
now ... it slouched toward him ...
not fast , but slowly ...
slowly ... so very slowly .
silly boy .
just the bulkhead shifting .
what' d you think it was ?
the malediction ?
wahh !
what exactly bothers you , o' dell ?
well , you have a ship that' s sinking slow enough to get a few lifeboats off , but the submarine only fires one torpedo .
i mean , that' s not textbook tactics .
you fire upon the target until the target is sunk .
so it was their last torpedo .
yeah , but ... why not use a deck gun ?
o' dell , isn' t this your first patrol ?
my second .
yeah .
and your first was a little shakedown run off the coast of florida in one of those old school boats , right ?
i' m just wondering if the story didn' t seem a little off .
i wouldn' t worry about it , champ .
they got here somehow . ... you want coffee ? ... sure .
i take it black .
tell broadway make sure it' s hot .
try to sleep .
i know you' re in pain , but you must try .
please .
be quiet .
sonar contact .
220 turns per minute , mr. brice .
maybe the z class .
maybe we didn' t shake him after all .
... full stop ! ... full stop !
boat stands at full stop .
mr. coors ... ... flood negative . ... flood negative .
o' dell , get on the thermograph .
find us some cold .
conn , 5 degree gradient at 2 7 0 feet .
cold water deflects sound waves just in case they decide to ... ... aah !
splashes ! ... splashes ! ... splashes !
god damn it !
keep it steady !
scared you , didn' t it , kid ?
damage reports .
well , maybe that z class just happened to be there .
and maybe the phonograph wasn' t secured .
but god damn .
and maybe someone doesn' t want us to make it home .
miss page claims she was in the control room the whole time .
yeah , that' s right . ... so what about the other guy ? ... kingsley ?
hmph !
if that' s his name .
where was he when it all happened ?
i' m not sure .
maybe he stepped out .
stepped out ... or slipped out ?
you know , maybe we' re spending more time watching that broad than watching our backs .
who , me ?
i' ve talked to her twice .
i heard you were bird dogging her , o' dell .
been running your mouth , ensign , about boat matters ?
gentlemen , gentlemen .
as for the record player going off , well , yeah , that' s strange .
but i don' t think it calls for a lynching party .
i think we should all just take a deep breath . ... conn , brice .
where' d you find it ?
make a hole !
lieutenant , i was all set to toss these pants , then i noticed this , sir .
and these came from ...
the half dead guy , sir .
must' ve been him done that record player .
wake him up .
i i' m sorry .
i' m not quite sure ...
wake the german up .
hello , " mein kapitan " .
jesus .
it was me .
it was my idea .
i was the one who told him not to speak .
she had him under our noses the whole goddamn time .
aah ! ... wait ! ... i' il tell you .
i' il tell you everything .
his name is ben archerlift .
he' s a downed aviator .
he' s a patient of mine .
he' s a prisoner of war , and under the geneva convention , he' s entitled to humane treatment !
he has a wife and family .
he wants to get home just like you or me .
everything will be all right .
you should' ve told me .
maybe i was afraid you' d do exactly what you' ve just done !
you should' ve told me no matter what ,
' cause your little secret nearly cost every man here his life .
you had no cause .
mr. o' dell , the woman is confined to quarters for the duration of the patrol .
if she asks to use the toilet , you are to bring her a bucket .
stumbo , clean up that fuckin ' mess .
fucking a 1 , sir .
i' il be in my berth ... sleeping .
i just wanted to save one .
just ... one of my patients .
aaaahh !
look , it' s happened twice now .
i don' t think that' s an accident .
somebody is up to something .
well , just so you know , i' ve walked in the wardroom before and found a steward listening to the record player while he was cleaning up . ... now , i wouldn' t blame him ... ... unless he' s ... ... hey , champ . ... hey .
how are those hydrogen levels ?
it' s almost 3 % .
chief says we need to vent before long .
all right .
we' il ride surface tonight ... 2100 .
is there something else ?
yeah .
i just can' t believe it' s one of our own hands doing this .
i' ve been on the boat seven weeks now , and i know most of the guys .
i just don' t believe it' s one of them . ... who are you suggesting ? ... i' m not suggesting anybody .
you know , it' s been a rough patrol .
some men do strange things under duress .
so just keep your eyes open .
yes , sir .
bright kid , o' dell .
get off .
get off before it' s too late .
down here .
i i was awake .
i wasn' t dreaming .
i know i was awake .
don' t let them get to you .
i heard a voice .
i heard it .
it' s nothing .
just ignore them , all right ?
claire , are you listening ? ... i thought he spoke to me . ... claire ...
it wasn' t his voice , but he spoke to me .
claire !
... is this your idea of a joke ? ... claire , don' t .
have you got nothing better to do at a time of war than play games with dead bodies ? !
you are on thin ice ... real thin ice .
wrap it back up ... for the last time .
we' il dump him when we surface .
a bit more respect for the dead might be in order , mr. brice ... from everybody onboard this ship .
this is a boat you' re a guest on , not a ship .
get off before it' s too late !
hoag , are you pushing him up or feeling him up ?
i' ve got a dead kraut dick in my face , and you' re complaining ?
come on , stumbo !
you need to turn around .
oh , nice try .
hoag told you , right ?
turn around .
so many left behind .
i want ...
god damn it !
what the hell are you doing , stumbo ?
... stumbo .
i' m telling you , there' s some bad hoodoo on this boat .
that might' ve worked on the female , stumbo , but not me .
look , fuck the brillo pad .
this ain' t about her .
he talked to me .
oh , wow . ... the dead guy ? ... the dead kraut talked to me . ... yeah , right .
wow .
did he talk to you in english or german ?
i guess it was english .
case closed .
prepare to surface .
prepare to surface .
be ready on all four engines .
stand by to charge batteries .
let' s go .
come on .
move it , move it .
okay , okay .
the chief' s gonna skin us alive .
i don' t care what he said .
i' ve just got to get out of that room .
well ... make it quick , all right ?
switching to night lights .
coming up to periscope depth .
lookouts , gun crews ... stand by .
took periscope photos of german sub pent at lorient
before moving on to areas north .
o. m. i. should be happy with results .
saw multiple shipping targets ,
but passed on all .
men getting itchy to come home ...
with at least one kill .
picked up three survivors
from the fort james british merchantman and hospital ship .
reportedly victims of a german u boat .
some tall grass out there .
yeah , it' s good skies , though .
oh , yeah .
oh , we should be able to hit a couple of sites , affix our position .
well done .
the sextant in my cabin .
very well .
is it possible to see the ...
uh , talk to me later .
mr. coors , are we going to be surfacing soon , take on some fresh air ? ... we' re trying to . ... any idea when that might be ?
what are you doing here ?
i i wasn' t comfortable in my cabin , what with the blood on the walls .
you shouldn' t be in the skipper' s cabin without permission .
well , i' il gladly ask him .
mr. brice is the skipper , isn' t he ?
lieutenant brice is the current c. o. of the boat .
you need his permission to be anywhere besides your assigned quarters .
now ...
sorry .
motormac jenkins to the battery room .
motormac jenkins to the battery room .
screws kicking over , starboard beam !
emergency dive !
emergency dive !
dive !
flood negative !
give me a 25 degree angle on the bow plane !
25 on the bow plane , sir !
used to feel like a " big " ocean , didn' t it ?
we are running out of places to hide .
crow , give me one sounding for depth on " their " ping . ... got that ? ... yes , sir . ... 3 ... ... 2 ... ... 1 .
not much there , sir .
bring in the soundheads .
let' s use it all .
aah !
what was that ?
don' t ask me .
ask him . ... what was that ? ... miss page , once again ,
i must remind you , do not leave your station .
what did we hit just now ? !
the bottom .
well , how long can we afford to stay down here ?
i thought you said we needed to surface to take on ...
attention all hands ... off duty personnel are expected to be in the racks .
and the smoking lamp is out .
i guess we' re gonna find out .
seaweed .
might be a fishing net .
it' s caught up , slaps against the hull .
you hear ... you hear a lot of strange things at depth .
i mean , i can' t even identify ' em all .
so ...
what am i gonna do with you ?
i' m sorry .
i regret not telling you about schillings ... because ... well , l i should have realized that a submarine isn' t a good place to keep secrets .
is it ?
we' d been stalking a german sub tender for a while .
we finally got our shot in , cracked its back with one torpedo .
we went topside to survey the damage , and the ship was gone .
but there' s a lot of debris in the water , and captain winters decides to go down and haul some in .
it was the middle of the atlantic .
he wants to do some souvenir hunting , get something for his ...
i don' t know ... his mantle piece .
i try to talk him out of it , and ... but he' s al ...
anyway , he ... the boat hit an underwater obstruction , and he fell ... he hit his head .
and he was ... he went under before we could get to him .
i heard you were asking .
so he drowned .
we already radioed connecticut with news of the accident .
you know , we really , really got off on the wrong foot , and i ...
so j just feel free to move about the forward sections of ...
sorry , sir ... humidity builds up , drips out the power bus .
i' il get right on it .
so ... would you reconsider england ... finding a port there ?
i' m sorry .
sorry for what ?
uh , she was ... asking about winters .
what did you tell her ?
the story .
well , it' s coming up astern , but ...
i don' t know what that is .
hooks !
they' re using their hooks !
mr. loomis , what do we do ?
what are your orders , mr. brice ?
mr. loomis , the helm is waiting !
the men are waiting for your orders , mr. brice !
aah !
get out !
get out !
everybody , out !
move it out !
go !
go !
go !
everybody , out ! ... come on ! ... get out !
get out !
get out !
get down there , harry !
move !
get out .
o' dell , make sure everybody' s out ! ... everybody' s out , sir ! ... then close the goddamn hatch ! ... blow safety ! ... blow safety !
what heading , sir ? !
any goddamn heading !
just get us out of here !
you' il do better at the board of inquiry .
we' re sloughing oil , and it' s bad .
i don' t know exactly where it is , but it' s somewhere between the pressure hull and the sea hull .
and if it' s leaking here or here , then it' s dumping oil under the main ballast , which means that every time we surface or dive ...
we leave an oil slick .
well , that' s how ... that' s how he' s been riding us .
this boat " is " cursed .
figure of speech .
so how do we fix it ?
well , there' s only one way ... from the outside in .
they' il be lining up for this job .
okay , so let' s make ready some dive gear .
all right .
o' dell , pick two volunteers ...
yes , sir . ... besides yourself .
you want someone to free dive outside with you into the cold , black water , make our way below the boat ,
iocate the floodboards , and slither in between the two hulls ?
that' s right .
find the leak and fix it . ... at night . ... hang on .
we' re still submerged .
that means the main tanks are full of water .
this is in the dark , dell .
yeah , well , chief thinks that with the tower flooded , it gives the boat enough weight to stay down while we blow some air into the main tank .
oh , well if that' s what the chief thinks .
so ... you' re gonna go out there .
you' re gonna go outside .
yes , that' s right .
with all these ... happenings happening .
look alive .
all right .
who are the lucky bastards ?
fuck , no .
set .
i asked him to go .
buddy system .
... ooh ! ... oh , shit !
you and me , o' dell .
forward .
you guys take aft .
shit !
2330 hours .
to confirm sinking of german ship , four officers go topside ...
commander winters , myself , lieutenant loomis , and lieutenant j. g. stephen coors .
the night we lost old man winters ...
odd time to bring that up .
it' s an odd place .
so , how' d he bang his head before he went over ?
so , how' d he bang his head before he went over ?
you heard .
i heard that the boat hit something , but i never felt it down below .
what ? !
i didn' t say anything .
i know , but what were you thinking ?
well ...
i used to hear about these dock workers .
they would get welded up in these kind of places .
and then ... they were never heard from again .
wally ?
you are so fucking out of bounds with that shit !
let' s keep moving .
forward trim tank , it looks like .
better drive some wedges .
yeah .
so anything i say ... stays here ... this side of the hull .
yeah .
yeah .
there were survivors from the sinking . ... brice and loomis even , uh ... even tried to fish a few out , but ...
winters had other ideas , and , uh ... he ordered a gunnery party topside .
well , three of us had a problem with machine gunning those men right in the water ,
i mean , even if they were german .
there was an argument .
it got kind of heated .
well , why didn' t you tell us ? !
i guess , uh ...
i guess we were trying to protect him ... felt winters was a pretty good c. o. , even if he could be a tough son of a bitch sometimes .
for his reputation ... you know , his family' s sake .
yeah , yeah , okay , but ...
i still don' t see how he hit his head .
slippery metal .
bad footing .
accidents happen , right ?
where the hell did that come from ? !
near or aft ?
crew , sound off !
get them out of there !
get them out !!
o' dell !
sound off , o' dell !
... oh ! ... sir !
fuck , was that you ?
the light !
we gotta get him out .
come on , guys . ... how are we gonna ...
did you see that ?
what happened , guys ? !
come on !
what happened out there ? !
... talk to me . ... don' t touch me .
did you fix it ?
which one of you boys was screaming out there ? ... are we a man down ? ... don' t touch me ! ... are we a man down ? ! ... shut up !
who was screaming ? !
come on , grow some dicks and shut up !
now , where is mr. o ...
coors ... where' s coors ?
you tell me that' s him .
that' s gotta be coors .
he' s still alive , right ?
sir ... that is the one person i can guarantee it' s not .
don' t touch me .
don' t touch me ! ... don' t !
don' t ! ... hey , easy .
easy , stumbo .
easy , easy . ... easy , easy . ... was that a " b " ... dash , dot , dot , dot ?
i didn' t hear a " b.
dot , dash ... " a " ... thought i heard an " a.
no , that' s not morse .
it' s just some shit got caught up on the bow planes .
now it' s smacking up against ...
c " ... you hear a " c " ?
dash , dot , dash , dot ... definitely a " c.
it' s hull sounds .
you guys are getting lathered up about hull sounds .
now , would somebody please tell us what happened to mr. coors ?
back " ... b a c k.
he' s back .
and where' d you get the " k " from ?
dash , dot , dash ... while you were talking .
hey , champ , you can stay the hell out of this . ... and the rest of you ... ... enough , already , enough !
i n the wardroom , 5 minutes .
keep your mouths shut till we debrief .
did you finish the job ?
yes , sir , absolutely .
right , wally ?
wally ?
oh , yeah , i' m finished .
all right , so , look , if the weather is good , we surface tonight , we recharge the batteries .
we pour on the diesel , keep pushing for the barn .
our barn ?
mr. brice , southern english port' s gonna be more than two days away .
two days away , mr. brice !
kingsley here is a navigational officer .
he knows the way .
i know all the ports , the depths , where the submarine nets are , the mine fields .
yeah , and have the r. a. f. bomb us because they mistake us for a hostile boat ... okay .
there are safety corridors that we can use ...
considered and rejected , thank you .
mr. brice , both our periscopes are down , our sonar is gone .
we are blind and nearly deaf .
our men are in a bad way , and now we' ve lost two of our senior officers .
welcome to the war , o' dell .
this has nothing to do with the war .
just how much longer can we not say what we' re all thinking ?
no one wants to be the first ?
fine .
allow me .
this submarine is haun ...
when i want your opinion , miss page , i' il give it to you .
i am not one of your men that you can just dismiss , mr. brice !
i don' t believe we' re alone down here , and i know some of you think the same way .
unless we find a safe harbor soon , we' re all going to end up like your friend mr. coors .
the loss of lieutenant coors is unfortunate .
it fails to affect our plans .
attention all hands ... it' s daylight now .
i expect to surface ... at 1900 , recharge the batteries , and proceed on base course back to connecticut . ... that is all .
you' re 10 seconds away from finding out what the penalty is for mutiny at sea ,
' cause that' s how long it' s gonna take me to open the armory and reload that sidearm .
now , do either of you care to say anything else that might further agitate this crew or me ?
mr. o' dell ?
yeah , i didn' t think so .
we just knock the nose around a little bit , we' re back on base , so make it 2 8 5 .
make it 2 8 5 true .
2 8 5 true , sir .
heading home , boys .
sound good ? ... yes , sir . ... sounds good , sir .
hey , you' re oversteering .
mind your rudder .
she' s getting some resistance , sir .
chief of boat to control .
chief of boat to control room .
all right , belay that .
belay that .
i said belay that !
... oh ! ... oh !
rudder at midship , sir .
um , some ... kind of hydraulic failure .
oh , christ .
must have overshot our heading by ... 170 degrees .
oh , good .
a gun .
yeah , i needed a gun .
i' il put that with the prizes .
okay , i got feathers , crosses , and strip show icons ...
rudder malfunction .
when we tried to shut down the props , no dice .
wouldn' t respond .
we' re on a runaway boat , fellas .
now , can any of you top that ?
well ...
i had a strange thought .
take a number .
yeah , but this one' s real creep show stuff .
what if , when we took on that kraut ship ... ... we didn' t sink ' em ?
what if ... they sank us ?
oh , that' s a good twist .
i don' t get it .
might explain how that dead kraut talked to stumbo .
i don' t get it .
and the controls ... that they froze up .
no , they ... they rusted up .
that' s because we' re at the ... the bottom of the ocean .
flooded out .
of course , i' m not sure what all that pounding was about .
those are rescue divers ... pounding on the hull .
only it' s too late .
shit , i get it .
hydrogen from the batteries ...
hydrogen from the batteries ...
co2 , ozone from the electrical shorts ... that' s what we' re breathing right now .
like those deep sea divers that don' t get enough oxygen ... head starts playing tricks on ' em .
we got mechanical problems , that' s all , okay ?
we always got mechanical problems .
now , please ... will you pinch this shit off ? ... unless ... ... oh ...
it happened during the depth charging .
remember that one ?
rolled right down our deck .
so exactly how far from england are we ?
can i ask why you' re asking ?
no .
right .
uh , what' s our heading ?
0 9 5 .
right .
uh ...
may i ask why you' re asking ?
just in case the boat can' t make it back home ... for whatever reason .
what do you suggest we do about it , chief ?
come on .
enough of the guessing games . ... pressure blinding the shafts . ... no , i don' t think that' s it .
just lay it out for us , chief .
what about the i. m. o. pumps ?
i. m. o. pumps check out .
i don' t think it' s that either .
the rudder has a dedicated line from here to the stern .
if we tap into there somewhere aft ,
i think we should regain our steering .
but where are you gonna tap in ?
that' s the thing .
the line goes right through the battery room .
that' s a little dicey , isn' t it , without venting first ?
just threading up new hydraulics , no welding .
well , where are we at , anyway ?
13 percent down . ... 13 percent hydrogen ? ... keep your voice down .
look , i don' t know any other way to regain control ...
fuck if i know .
all right , but you gotta make sure you' re sealed off ,
' cause we don' t want a repeat of the " hindenburg " here .
let' s keep this quiet .
as if it' s a bloody mechanical problem .
fore door sealed .
after door sealed .
what' s happened here , hmm ?
what is this ?
go to the galley .
get a cup of coffee .
oh , no , i' m fine , sir .
really .
you' re falling asleep , champ . ... i' il watch your bubble . ... yes , sir .
lieutenant , a word ?
lieutenant , a word ? ... not now . ... no , mr. loomis .
we need to speak right now .
that is a whale , right ?
what else would it be ?
come on .
let' s get that rudder working .
now , maybe this is just a coincidence .
i know lieutenant coors wasn' t too sure about the last star fix .
but it sure seems like we' re going right back to where we sunk that german ship .
clear the compartment .
everybody , give us 5 minutes .
go !
all right .
we' re almost all set .
just repressurizing the line , see if we can' t put the brakes on this little joyride .
i' il reset the bus .
shit !
hey , guys , we lost power up here .
shut that goddamn door before i shut it with your goddamn face !
what are you saying , o' dell ?
it' s not a coincidence ?
somebody put us on this course ?
i' m just asking a question .
let me ask one .
where were " you " when the rudder went over ?
huh ?
this course heads back to england , and i' ve noticed you' ve had a hard on for anything english .
so where were you , o' dell ?
back of the boat ... messing with the rudder assembly ?
or did you get some motormac ...
that is the craziest thing i have ever heard !
not as crazy as what you' re saying !
i' m tired of this hoodoo horseshit !
it is " not " what you think it is !
it is not even remotely " fucking " possible !
okay ? !
after room , get the chief to pick up .
hoag !
maneuvering room , respond .
anybody , contact control .
... mr. loomis , where' s our crew ?
it' s warm .
loomis ...
i i , um ...
go ahead .
i' m gonna change up my scrub .
keep looking .
gotta be somebody .
all right .
all right , chief . ... we found you . ... don' t ...
can you feel anything ... your legs , your toes , anything at all ? ... don' t ... ... come on . try to stop me .
you' re gonna pull through .
especially ... ... you .
time to go .
battery' s still working .
what happened ?
what happened ?
sparks ... the hydrogen .
everybody ... everybody' s ...
loomis ...
loomis ?
... sir !
sir ! ... get out of my way ! ... whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . ... get the fuck off me !
loomis ! ... loom ...
he' s here .
did he even have ... air ?
not a bloody foot .
come on , stumbo .
keep trying .
we gotta release that air .
come on .
one more .
come on , stumbo .
it' s like it' s welded .
all i know is what coors told me .
and apparently ...
captain winters wanted to shoot the german survivors .
mr. brice and mr. loomis and mr ....
mr. coors ... wanted to help .
apparently captain winters lost the argument .
well , that' s interesting .
but it' s not what i heard ... from mr. brice .
lieutenant ?
are you sure he came back here ?
looking for me ?
i , uh ...
just ... reporting , sir , that the heating is down .
and , uh ... the bow' s levers are stuck .
stumbo' s working on it right now .
and that we show 90 pounds of compressed air still left in the system , and i ... wasn' t sure if you wanted to use that when we tried to surface or use it now so we can breathe .
shinola .
sir ?
running out of shinola , too .
we also wanted to ask you about captain winters ... whether there was anything you could tell us about what happened that night that might help us to understand ...
don' t pretend you don' t know .
just don' t pretend anymore .
well , wasn' t that awkward ?
maybe hoag was right .
maybe we already bought it .
if not the depth charge , then ... the hydrogen .
if not the hydrogen , then ... maybe the cold .
and if not that , then we got a big evil spirit batting cleanup . ... jesus christ . ... come on , stumbo .
there should only be so many ways a guy can die .
listen to me .
co2 hangs low .
it starts from the floor up , and i need you right now ... ... no , no . ... to get up on your feet . ... maybe i just need to ... ... stumbo .
stumbo ! ... let me try . ... we already bought it .
come on , stumbo .
head up . ... over and over ... ... i need you to sit up . ... over and over again . ... look at me .
now look at me .
look at me . ... good .
feel that ?
well , you' re alive , then , aren' t you ?
you fuckin ' ... ... stumbo ... ... whoa , hey , hey , hey !
hey ! ... take it easy !
hey ! ... relax , man !
stumbo !
isn' t there a winch or a pulley or maybe a come along in a bowsman' s locker ? ... yeah . ... can' t we use that ?
you know what he' s talking about , stumbo ? ... yeah . ... well , come on .
come ... we need it .
come on .
show ... show me , stumbo .
we' ve got to get it .
okay , come on .
come on .
so , tell me why three officers would conspire to kill their captain and cover it up .
that' s what you' re thinking , isn' t it ?
what if i am ?
i can see i' m not the only one .
loomis was up for a major citation .
and brice was ready for his own command .
he was from a naval family .
he went to annapolis .
coors had this beautiful girl waiting for him back in boston that he was always talking about , claire .
these guys had everything to live for .
by that reasoning ... they had everything to lose .
are we missing somebody ?
wallace ...
wallace ?
... no ! ... no !
no ! ... shh ! ... no o o ! ... it' s just us .
it' s just ... us . ... now , listen ...
we' re running out of plays in the playbook .
do you have ... any idea why the boat is going back or how we can get control of it ?
i' ve been checking the literature on this subject .
and the thing we know about maledictions is ...
maledictions ?
look it up .
maledictions don' t issue from heaven or hell but from some unresolved place in between .
i n fact , there' s a great ...
wallace ... we' re running out of air .
suffice to say ... the malediction needs satisfaction in order to escape its netherworld .
and if you had to guess ... what would satisfy our malediction ?
old man winters never got a chance to go down with the ship , did he ?
wallace , leave yours here .
we gotta dig up some more light .
okay , listen , uh ...
just ...
just promise me you' il stay on your feet , okay ?
don' t pretend ...
don' t pretend you don' t ... know .
sight target believed to be german sub tender .
winters orders flank speed to close target and gain a firing angle .
loomis checks target profile against i. d. iog , matching it to target , and i personally verify the match .
single torpedo fired from number 4 tube .
heard the strike , followed by collapsing bulkheads .
to confirm sinking of german ship , four officers go topside ...
commander winters , myself , lieutenant loomis , and lieutenant j. g. stephen coors .
many bodies in the water .
ship burning on the horizon .
what are you doing in here ?
go .
a german ship ... of the type brice said you sunk .
my ship ... the fort james hospital ship .
so what you' re saying is ... that the submarine kingsley saw ... the one he thought was german ...
wasn' t .
so it was an accident ?
not when he left us in the water to die .
not when he heard the cries for help in english .
you actually believe that captain winters would just leave ...
help !
help me !
no .
captain winters wanted to pick up the survivors .
that means ...
help !
who mis i. d. ' d the ship ?
who had everything to lose ?
either the battery has finally crapped out , or ...
or maybe we' re here .
come on .
let' s get some air going .
... all right .
come on , everybody , pull !
come on !
come on !
pull !
fuck me .
this is it . ... oh ! ... god , i hate being right .
... pull !
kingsley .
oh , jesus , god , we' re going down .
it' s going up .
it' s going up !
... okay .
all right .
wallace , see if you can work the radar , get a sweep of the area .
stumbo , see if you can crack this hatch .
use a crowbar .
drain the tower .
see if we can get out that way .
if not , we gotta go out the forward ...
oh , god .
hey , fellas ... we have contact .
on sj radar ... 4 , 000 yards , starboard beam .
it' s the same one ?
it' s the same kraut ship ? ... are we being choosy ? ... all right .
uh , wallace , raise the antenna .
issue a radio challenge on the ariel 6 .
get the ship i. d. ' d as of right now .
well done , mr. o' dell .
but i' m feeling much better now .
you were saying ?
we have a contact .
that may be an opportunity .
an opportunity ?
to abandon ship .
well , i don' t know that that' s a friendly out there .
well , neither do i.
but it seems better to scuttle now and take our chances with a surface vessel , even if it is german .
scuttle and tell connecticut what ?
we sunk one of their finest fleet submarines because we lost a few men carrying out our mission ?
a few men , sir ?
contact at 2, 500 yards .
might cross the stern .
we' il wait ... right here .
wallace ... no matter what mr. brice says ,
i want you to go to the radio shack and establish a voice contact with that ship immediately .
you are not the skipper of this ship , mr. o' dell !
and neither are you , sir !
rain squall .
with a little luck , they won' t see us in all this ... ... weather .
here !
please !
we' re over here !
please !
help , please !
help !
on your starboard side !
it' s really not safe up here , miss page .
we' re going below now !
aah !
bury everybody and bury the truth ... is that it , brice ? !
like this .
this is how i go .
if that' s your plan ... get on with it , you fucking coward !
stumbo , man the ports .
get ready to scuttle this boat !
just leave !
they' il blame it on a u boat !
just get out of here !
they' il never fuckin ' know !
any more advice for me , champ ?
500 yards and closing !
looks like we' re definitely gonna lose some paint on this one , sir !
i kept looking for some way just ... just to ... take it back , to make it end right ... some way without dishonoring winters .
i was gonna wear this uniform back to port .
now ...
what should i do , miss page ?
you give me the light so that i can signal for help .
i don' t ...
god , i don' t know !
i just figured out why he didn' t kill me , too .
he didn' t have to .
aah !
hey !
over here !
come back !
come back .
well , you weren' t the first woman that ever slapped me , and you won' t be the last .
but that was a good thing you done for me back there .
well done , miss page .
well done , mr. stumbo .
dead but not buried , i see .
pardon me ?
your vessel .
so , what would you say if you had to explain it all ?
does seem rather unlikely now , doesn' t it ?
have you thought that ... that maybe when captain winters died , he just ... died , and that was it ?
and the rest ...
and the rest ...
i don' t know .
you say whatever you have to say , ensign .
i' il always believe we were brought back here for a reason .
