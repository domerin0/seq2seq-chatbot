this is me , three hundred years ago .
my name was heishiro inukai .
it' s a good name .
three centuries ago japan was ruled by the samurai .
the tokugawa shogunate had united the country , and it was a time of peace .
i was born the son of a samurai .
at age 21 , i met two " ronin " , or masterless samurai .
those encounters changed my life , and ensured that i remember them to this very day .
mr. kazamatsuri , i hope you realize the great honor .
this sword was given to our lord 80 years ago by tokugawa .
it is a clan treasure used in formal ceremonies .
guardian of the sword ?
if only it were that simple .
just remember , it' s very unusual for a newcomer such as you attain such an important post .
do not presume to impose on our lord' s good graces .
to be frank , a newcomer should behave accordingly .
make sure you fulfill your duty .
heishiro , a man' s mind should be composed at all times .
haste makes waste .
understand ?
i arranged for you to work at the castle with me .
yet you start a fight with some no account samurai .
he switched sandals with me !
no excuse !
you' ve studied fencing , but you' ve yet to master the samurai spirit .
why not keep a bird ?
it will help you to control your short temper .
birds belong in the wild .
you don' t get it .
these birds are perfectly happy in cages .
aren' t you , dear ?
checkmate , father .
what ?
councilor .
what is it ?
a messenger to see you .
i' il be right there .
before you go up to the castle cut your hair .
look proper .
yes , father .
so , let' s call it a draw .
what are you doing ?
how unfair !
just like a child .
what is the problem ?
my father was chief councilor to the nagashima clan , responsible for all clan affairs .
a problem had arisen .
a samurai , kazamatsuri , had killed an aide to our lord , and stolen the precious sword bestowed on us by the shogun .
we were granted the sword and the domain 80 years ago .
only we can tell the genuine one from a fake .
what are you suggesting ?
send men after kazamatsuri .
in the meantime , have a duplicate made .
a fake ?
why not just get the real sword back ?
we must consider many things .
the young lord' s attainment ceremony approaches .
without the sword , there will be hell to pay .
it could even lead to disbandment of the clan .
we must pretend that it was not stolen .
damn !
kazamatsuri came into our employ in a very dramatic fashion .
i seek vengeance for my son .
on guard !
what' il we do , boys ?
good looking woman .
it' d be a waste to kill her .
kill the old man and then enjoy her !
you beasts !
prepare to die !
father !
hey you , i killed her husband , the old man' s son .
you wanna protect these poor unfortunates ?
what' s so funny ?
you' re a dead man !
finish him off .
father ...
gladly , good sir !
no !
please don' t !
begin .
our lord wanted to observe kazamatsuri' s swordsmanship .
kazamatsuri !
the barbaric urge to watch gladiators battling has not changed since the roman era .
impressed , our lord hired kazamatsuri as a retainer .
i disagree with your methods , father .
i' il find him and kill him .
farewell .
stop !
i have already sent men after him .
you think he' il get away so you ordered up a fake .
not so loud .
i know i can do it .
while you were away in edo , he has improved greatly .
i have confidence in my swordsmanship .
i' m eager to match my sword against his .
heishiro !
idiot son .
kagemaru !
where are you this time ?
you rang , sir .
enough of this dropping from the ceiling !
yes , sir , but old ninja habits are hard to break .
isn' t there anyone else ?
a bit younger , perhaps ?
yes , i' m always training disciples for just such an occasion .
would you like to see them , sir ?
yes , that boy may attempt something stupid .
i' d like to have all the angles covered .
heishiro !
wait .
don' t try to stop me !
if you go alone , he' il kill you .
think about it , first .
i' m no coward like you !
come back !
i' il kill him .
no , i' il kill him .
i' il use my lance .
go back !
back home ?
which way ... !
these two have been my best friends since childhood .
our clansmen dubbed us " the three stooges " .
well !
i' m nowhere near as stupid as they are .
stop following me !
this is tadasuke kurosawa .
how dare you run ahead of me !
this is shintaro suzuki .
you just watch me !
this way , sir .
any of them catch your eye ?
there are so many ...
the sea goes on forever !
we often used to come here as boys .
i' m hungry .
me , too .
pick that up !
litterbug !
falcon !
red shadow !
you approve , sir ?
i feel good .
listen .
did you know that ...
tadasuke is betrothed to mr. mukai' s daughter .
is that true , tadasuke ?
that' s wonderful .
she' s beautiful .
i heard you played around in edo .
how were the women ?
don' t be stupid .
i' ve no time for women .
you' ve never had a woman ?
you' re still a virgin ?
damn !
don' t get so upset !
i haven' t , either .
me , neither .
but you soon will .
what the hell ... !
that' s the clan treasure !
so what ?
you finally showed your true colors .
i' ve had my suspicions about you .
you' re planning to steal it !
i' m merely having a look .
a likely story !
you' re a lying thief !
alright kazamatsuri , you asked for it !
how did it come to this ?
stop splashing me .
that feels better .
thank you .
what do you know about kazamatsuri ?
you never know what he' s thinking .
they say he' s unsociable and conceited .
as a newcomer he was treated distantly .
i saw him just once .
he' s got this really scary face .
like this ?
no , not even close .
that bad ?
but why did he steal the sword ?
see .
no one can figure him out .
i' ve got a wanted poster .
why didn' t you say so earlier ?
he' s a mean one , alright .
he' s 190cm tall .
he' s gigantic !
he looks tough , too .
so what !
he' s no match for me .
throw it .
that' il teach you !
look !
that' s kazamatsuri !
really ?
now we' ve got him !
tadasuke , you stay here .
why me ?
you have a fiance to consider .
he' s right .
don' t you worry about me .
tadasuke , don' t !
halt !
kazamatsuri !
on guard !
i am heishiro inukai of the nagashima clan .
i am tadasuke kurosawa .
shintaro suzuki !
he' s so scared he' s wetting himself !
don' t underestimate us .
make your move !
scared , are you ?
answer me !
fight !
that' s a long leak !
on guard !
we can' t wait !
a disgrace to the samurai .
shame on you !
the clan hired you and in return you stole .
shame on you !
are you listening ?
shintaro !
be strong !
damn !
heishiro !
tadasuke !
enough !
sheathe your sword .
please , enough .
no more killing , i beg you .
i must insist .
i beg you , sir !
i had no choice .
yes , i know .
but no more .
i' m sorry .
it bet it hurt .
i' m really sorry .
you in the shadows , come forth .
i' m going to need some help here .
honorable heishiro !
i understand your problem but this is going too far .
killing solves nothing .
please nurse him well .
i' il go back to the domain and make a report .
farewell .
and don' t come back !
but ...
next time he' il kill you for sure .
and your friend here , too .
swear that you' il never come back .
brooms !
basketware !
hello , nao .
got time for a cup of tea ?
sir , how would you like to have some fun ?
first , a spot of gambling to win some money , then a whorehouse for some real fun .
what do you say ?
good idea , sir ?
mr. samurai !
fools !
what the hell are you doing ?
the game' s starting !
boss , stop writhing , you' re making me miss the spot .
please stay still .
sakichi , ma' am !
enter .
another samurai has joined magobei .
is that so ?
i reckon he' s preparing an army to attack us .
magobei doesn' t have the balls to come at us alone .
only an idiot would recruit that band of incompetents .
but ma' am , we need more men .
don' t be hasty and end up with dregs .
leave everything to me .
a superb body .
what ! ?
turn on your side , please ma' am .
put some power into it !
yes , power , certainly ...
good .
yes , that' s the spot .
here ?
not there , you pervert !
but it' s such a lovely body .
ma' am , we' ve got some ronin out of control .
how interesting .
i' il go take a look .
he' il lose these cheating hands !
what !
let' s see you try !
you just watch it !
gentlemen , i think that' s quite enough .
don' t tell me a woman runs this show !
that' s all very interesting , but you run a crooked house , lady .
any trouble here and we feed you to the crows .
any man .
be he samurai or lord !
well , well !
in here , mr. samurai .
we' il leave it at this for today .
please .
be seated .
let' s begin .
i' il take over here .
we' re honored , ma' am .
yes , why not .
wonderful !
then place your bets .
into play !
place your bets .
odds or evens .
the betting is closed .
in play !
luck wasn' t with you today , was it ?
please come again .
sir , you' re welcome to stay as long as you like .
he' s awake .
how do you feel ?
i' m hanbei mizoguchi .
we met on the road .
what about my two friends ?
the one called suzuki is fine .
we had no room .
another family took him in .
his injuries were slight and he' s gone home .
good .
shintaro was saved .
don' t .
your wound will open again .
are you hungry ?
no appetite means you must stay in bed .
you' re not ready to get up .
my daughter , koharu .
you' ve been unconscious for two days .
you were in great pain that first night .
we were worried .
i' m in your debt .
are you sure you won' t eat something ?
i' il make some gruel .
those were the hardest days of that life .
i was so ashamed , i just wanted to curl up and die .
open your mouth , please .
that' s good .
father , your tea is getting cold .
delicious !
delicious .
ready , fight !
give him hell !
well done !
super !
what a woman !
here you are , sir .
let me refill your cup .
all the samurai i' ve known were totally useless .
i' ve never met a swordsman of your caliber .
you' re ever so strong , sir .
let' s take a bath .
sir , you really shouldn' t joke so .
i was asking him .
heishiro , don' t go .
i' il go kill him !
no , you mustn' t .
see !
you must get well first .
don' t stop me .
i must avenge tadasuke' s death .
please don' t .
damn it .
you can' t do anything until you' re well .
if you fight him now , he' il only beat you again .
enough koharu !
i' m sorry .
but you agree with me , don' t you father ?
regardless , stay in bed for now .
perhaps i can be of some assistance .
i appreciate it .
but you must not kill kazamatsuri .
there must be no more killing .
there are other means to recover the sword .
no !
he dies !
stubborn !!
look at that !
it' s so huge !
sir .
do you like the sea ?
yes , i do .
good .
me , i love the sea .
can i ask you something ?
what ?
how many men have you killed ?
please tell me , sir .
gosuke , how many women have you slept with ?
how many ?
i' ve lost count .
me , too .
cool !
cool !
cool !
gosuke .
take it off .
we' d better get going .
but sir !
wait for me .
don' t touch that !
you' il break out in a rash .
from just brushing against it ?
that stinks !
it' s an herb .
it makes an excellent medicine .
is that so ?
you' re so knowledgeable .
i shouldn' t be wasting time like this .
all this talk of killing and revenge is not helping you to recover .
look at the beautiful clouds .
be careful .
it' s slippery .
i slipped first .
but it was fun .
was it ?
this is a lovely place .
in autumn we get wild grapes .
are you alright ?
yes .
i wonder what caused that ?
but it really is delicious .
we had so much fun up on the mountain today .
we rolled around together , like this .
please let me explain .
we went there to pick herbs together .
koharu slipped first .
i , worried she may get hurt , extended my hand .
as a result we both fell .
if i got hurt out there it wouldn' t really matter .
but if koharu did , you' d think ill of me .
why are you both looking at me like that ?
we escaped with just a mud bath , that' s all .
so that' s all it was ?
we got totally covered in mud .
i' m relieved no one was hurt .
would you care for a drink ?
no , thank you .
i don' t drink .
even a whiff of it floors me for days .
if you say so ...
please do .
did i tell you about his nosebleed ?
excuse me .
kagemaru !
you rang , sir ?
how is my son ?
according to the report , he' s sufficiently recovered to gather herbs with a maiden .
a young girl ?
silly boy !
whatever is he thinking ?
enough about him .
where is the sword ?
still with kazamatsuri .
look .
that was wonderful music .
thank you .
tell us all the latest news from town .
the takatsume gang in town ...
some wild ronin called kazamatsuri joined them .
kazamatsuri , you say ?
you must have heard .
he chopped up those gamblers .
heishiro , you mustn' t !
please don' t .
it' s not wise .
try another way .
ask him to give it back .
ridiculous .
talk to the man .
he' il understand .
he' s no man !
i' il kill him .
yes !
but get him when he' s drunk .
persuade him to turn over a new leaf .
totally unbelievable .
you mustn' t !
he' il kill you first !
what ? !
i' il go talk to him .
you wait here .
never !
some hot sake , please .
that' s hot !
good .
excuse me .
what ?
is mr. kazamatsuri here ?
kazamatsuri ?
you' re a friend ?
i wouldn' t say friend , but ...
my name is hanbei mizoguchi .
i' m the petty samurai he attacked out on the road .
he' il remember me .
attacked by kazamatsuri , you say ?
then he' s after revenge , idiot !
get out !
i' m sorry for any imposition .
persistent little bugger !
out you go !
mr. kazamatsuri !
are you there ?
out with you !
arm yourselves !
the swords !
i didn' t mean to ...
i merely wish to see mr. kazamatsuri .
so sorry .
let me pull it out .
terribly sorry .
are you alright ?
you scoundrel !
be careful .
you' il hurt yourself .
that' s quite enough .
get him !
swords can be very dangerous .
be careful .
i' il come back when mr. kazamatsuri' s not indisposed .
who on earth was that ?
begging your pardon .
we have a favor to ask .
you two again ?
we are to escort heishiro back to the domain .
in that case , i' m happy to help .
but on one condition .
you carry him .
he stinks .
how could you ? !
he' s suffering so !
i had no choice .
i made him throw up , so he just needs sleep .
by the way ...
i' ve been thinking of enlarging my business for a while now .
you could be a great help .
and i' d be much happier with a larger territory .
don' t you agree ?
so skillful , but hidden away in the boondocks .
why ?
because i' m a member of the underworld .
totally different from those solid citizens .
hanbei mizoguchi , a master swordsman , indeed .
why do you hide yourself away ?
an era of peace ?
damned shogunate !
how do you feel now ?
i thought i' d die .
you poor thing .
i went to see kazamatsuri .
what ! ?
why didn' t you tell me earlier ?
so many ruffians there , i never even got to talk .
but i did meet a good ally .
falcon !
why are you here ?
i swapped a fake for this , the real sword .
your father has suffered a heart attack .
what ?
father is ill ?
you must return immediately .
first i must kill kazamatsuri .
so you say , but it was you who almost died .
i won' t fail again !
you will !
what ?
no time to argue , sir .
we' il watch kazamatsuri while you' re away .
i can' t go back empty handed .
nothing will be gained if you lose your life .
your friend will have died in vain .
your duty is to take the sword back .
you don' t understand !
you can kill him any time .
no , killing is ...
father , shut up .
you' re complicating matters .
excuse us .
falcon !
on horseback you could be home in three days .
i' il get a horse in town .
mr. mizoguchi !
get ready to travel .
you have but one father .
forgive me .
we really have no choice .
sorry you must spend your savings on me .
we weren' t talking about money .
good luck .
i' il find you a good horse .
you should be getting ready .
i' il make lunch in a little while .
how long have you lived like this ?
since i was this big .
doesn' t your father wish to work as an official ?
he' s not the kind of man to push himself forward .
indeed .
various lords have tried to recruit him .
actually , he was once hired as a martial arts instructor .
but being too modest can sometimes be offensive .
yes , i quite agree .
he hasn' t elaborated , but he' s always felt awkward with others .
i really don' t want him to be employed by some lord .
but if he receives a stipend from a lord and master , he must draw his sword for the lord' s sake .
i don' t want him to fight .
i think he feels the same .
you don' t resemble each other , but you both have gentle hearts .
actually i' m not his real daughter , you know .
i was an orphan .
he adopted me and raised me here .
i see .
blood relationships are of no importance to me .
i regard him as my real father .
help me peel these .
pull this bit off , like this .
that' s it .
shinkage fencing school grand hall
shinkage fencing school grand hall
excuse me .
may i help you ?
i have heard of master kajii' s reputation .
i' d appreciate a match with him .
it is customary to have a match with a disciple first .
yes , i know .
sorry about this , koharu .
begin !
ready ?
yes .
i yield .
next !
i yield .
next !
since your master appears to be indisposed ,
i' il accept a small sum instead .
it may seem rude to ask ... ... but why did he adopt you in the first place ?
well ... you see ...
he' s back !
take good care .
i' il be back soon .
god speed .
father !
good weather , isn' t it ?
i was relieved to hear you' re going to the whorehouse .
we were worried that you might be one of them .
i don' t want a woman .
you two go and have some fun .
really truly ?
thank you so much .
i' il just watch .
watch ?
sir !
right .
a touch more .
just a touch , i said !
look , the pony express .
so fast ... ... in the saddle .
he' s coming back .
it' s councilor inukai' s lad .
how is my father ?
something wrong with him ?
i heard he had a heart attack .
no way !
he' s full of beans .
only yesterday he cussed me out something fierce .
what ? !
they tricked me !
take this to him !
the ancestral sword !
but sir ...
speedy !
they tricked me !
let us begin !
come on , everyone .
alright then , lads .
who' il be first ?
you ?
good .
ready ?
you win .
here you go .
who' s next ?
you want to try ?
c' mon , let' s go .
hanbei mizoguchi ?
let' s have a duel .
it' s a penny a try .
i meant a real match .
why so eager to cross swords with me ?
it' s perfectly natural for a master swordsman to fight .
i admit you' re better .
isn' t that enough ?
will you return the sword to that young noble ?
you mean inukai ?
he' s the stupid son of an hereditary councilor .
such an idiot can succeed to important positions .
that' s the way of the world .
if he raises a hand to me again ,
i' il chop the damn thing off .
if you agree to a match with me , i' il return the sword .
father .
let' s make some plum brandy and sell it .
so many plums this year .
he' s back .
falcon deceived me .
the rat !
he must have had good reason to .
kazamatsuri had reason to take the sword , too .
ridiculous !
he killed father' s attendant and stole it .
plus he killed tadasuke .
if you try to stop me , i' il never forgive you .
how about another helping ?
mr. inukai .
i think i know how to beat kazamatsuri .
don' t get too close .
throw stones .
ridiculous .
with swords , you' ve no chance against him .
a surprise attack would never work .
i threw stones at him and saved your life .
y ... yes , but ...
you remember , don' t you ?
don' t denigrate stones !
i won' t .
throw them at him like rain .
then hit him with a big stick .
that' s it .
no need to kill him .
i understand !
thank you .
good !
all set .
watch me .
i get it .
close .
lower !
what are you doing ?
off your knees !
stretch that arm .
tuck in your chin .
aim higher .
father .
he' s hopeless .
that you , okatsu ?
how did you know ?
the wind brought your scent to me .
i' m pleased that you recognize my smell .
this sword must be very dear to you .
it' s nothing but an ornament .
take it if you want .
i don' t want a sword .
master .
you deserve more than a mere samurai' s life .
why not quit your rank ... and help me to take over this area ?
you' il wear fine clothes .
as many women as you like .
a life of luxury awaits you .
don' t make a sound .
kazamatsuri is too much for you to handle .
he' s a criminal who spits on the shogunate .
what did he do ?
in that brocade sheath is a treasured gift from the shogun .
if you do as i say , you will live .
the reward is 1, 000 in gold .
is this a trick ?
mix this into his drink .
good shot !
you' re doing very well .
no , i need more practice .
let me help you .
no need to .
i can do it myself ...
but i want to help you .
let me take this .
it' s too heavy for you .
are you alright ?
another nosebleed .
practicing too hard , perhaps ?
too much can hurt you .
aren' t you respectful today ?
how unusual .
what are you making ?
pepper balls .
pepper balls ?
to fling into his eyes .
ninja weapons .
that' s brilliant !
good with rice balls , too .
aren' t you the early bird ?
how about a wake up dram ?
okatsu .
will you marry me ?
i' m very flattered .
i was serious .
that' s not very nice .
but really ...
it' s all so sudden .
a woman needs time to think things over .
i' m a woman who' s killed all manner of men .
even trumped up little samurai like you !
no stray dog is going to give me any cheek .
how did it come to this ?
what was that ?
madam !
what happened ?
oh no ...
stones , stones .
a sword is no way to win .
i graduated from a fencing school .
how proud you must be .
i' ve heard you once taught at a fencing school .
for all outward appearances .
too much modesty brings others ' hatred .
you' re a skilled swordsman .
yet you stop me from killing kazamatsuri .
killing is wrong .
that' s what swords are for .
don' t you wear yours when you go to town ?
for what other possible reason ?
i' m ashamed to say ...
i still cling to the hope of being employed as an official .
but let me make one thing clear !
martial arts are not about killing !
i don' t understand .
why do you stop me from killing a wicked man like him ?
i killed a man once .
he was koharu' s father .
koharu' s real father was named ryunosuke kuzumi .
fifteen years ago the fief i belonged to had a border dispute with a neighboring clan .
i was a guard there , under orders to kill anyone crossing the border .
kuzumi had a similar duty for his clan .
in the river , which was claimed by both clans ,
i met kuzumi and we crossed swords .
the first time i killed a man .
i was overwhelmed by guilt .
one thing ...
what ?
grant me a favor .
kuzumi had a young daughter .
a widower , his last words were of regret for his daughter .
i , a single man at the time , left the fief and adopted her .
but not from sympathy or guilt .
i decided to rectify the sin i had committed , by raising the child of the man i had killed .
as she grew up , i realized a truth ...
one must cherish life and live it to its end .
that is a man' s duty .
as a young man i was very conceited .
proud of my fencing skills and afraid of nothing .
i would have likely ended up like kazamatsuri .
the human spirit contains both good and evil .
even those who seem evil have some good in them .
even kazamatsuri may change .
only the gods should take a person' s life .
i' ve said too much .
does koharu know that you killed her father ?
yes , i told her .
tell mizoguchi to fight me if he wants to get koharu back .
falcon !
kazamatsuri has got koharu !
what !
prepare to die kazamatsuri !
you take care of koharu .
yes !
no !
don' t get too close .
hanbei mizoguchi ,
i see though your mask hiding anger and thirst for revenge .
it is as plain as day to me .
you' il wear that mask till your dying day .
but you will cross swords with me this day !
i accept the challenge .
draw your blade !
your father will surely win .
you will be my wife .
mizoguchi will be my father .
it' s all decided !
sir !
falcon , protect her .
don' t die !
i' il never forgive you .
mr. mizoguchi .
stay back .
don' t get too close !
hanbei mizoguchi ...
it was an honor to have fought you .
and that was how kazamatsuri went out of my life .
no trace of anger , no resentment , did he let show on his face .
as i prayed for him , i felt something greater ... ... watching over me from above .
when a man abandons ego and obstinacy , he can accept the gods and learn how to truly love .
it took me a long time to realize that essential truth .
the most important thing is to give your all until the very last .
kagemaru !
you rang , sir .
falcon !
you rang , sir .
we just felt like calling you .
i shaved my pate and became an official .
i married koharu , who softened both father' s temper and mine .
how does that feel ?
terrible .
right , my pretty ?
red shadow quit the ninja and became a maid to koharu .
mizoguchi became clan secretary and sheathed his sword forever .
hard at it , eh ?
oh yes , about the sword ...
there' s no sign of his body .
probably swept down river .
he couldn' t have survived .
what shall we do ?
what ?
the sword in the river is the real one .
what !
the sheath was over there .
then the sword must be directly below !
here it is !
here ?
yes , here .
can you swim ?
we' il soon find out .
go !
