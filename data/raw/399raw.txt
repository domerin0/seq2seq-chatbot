25 . 000
this is the story of a squad of marines , a rifle squad .
i' m corporal robert dunne , a member of that squad .
we were at guadalcanal , and when it was secure we were pulled out for rest , refitting , replacements and retraining .
the marine corps is long on training and retraining ... let that go .
after the canal , we were sent to camp paekakariki in new zealand .
here we received our replacements , marines from stateside , a long way from stateside , 8, 000 miles .
i can see you' re a man who knows how to live .
solid comfort .
solid malaria .
malaria , huh ?
contagious ?
no , not this week .
you can stay .
nice place you got here .
regazzi' s my name , benny regazzi .
bob dunne .
i' m duty nco today .
great .
meet my friends .
this big guy is " handsome " dan shipley .
hi .
what a physique !
the girls see him and faint .
he comes through this , i' il make him a movie star !
those two guys , flynns .
that' s eddie and that' s frank .
hi , eddie .
hello , bob .
they don' t drink .
i got their beer ration .
and georgie hellenopolis , an irishman .
hello , sport .
where did you get those cards ?
off your sack on the ship .
why ?
they' re mine , that' s why .
i' ve seen lots in those bags that aren' t .
come on , give me .
" semper fi " , mac .
hey !
leave them .
it happens 20 times a day .
you know where those guys come from ?
philadelphia , the city of brotherly love .
by the way , who' s the squad leader ?
sergeant stryker .
what' s he like ?
you' il find out .
i' ve been in new zealand two hours and already they' re clamming up on me .
i hope he knows his stuff .
maybe we' il get liberty .
we ain' t replacements any more .
where is he ?
where' s the sergeant ?
he' s here .
well , what do you know ?
stryker .
hello , thomas .
thought you were in the first .
i was .
sit down .
just sit down , thomas , anywhere .
my name is stryker , sergeant john m stryker .
you' re gonna be my squad , a rifle squad .
corporal dunne , charlie bass and myself .
you' il learn from us .
in boot camp you learned out of a book .
here you gotta remember the book and learn things that haven' t been printed .
you gotta learn right and fast .
any man that doesn' t want to cooperate , i' il make him wish he hadn' t been born .
before i' m through with you , you' re gonna move and think like one man .
if you don' t , you' il be dead .
you guys have had a nice easy day .
i hope you enjoyed it because it' s the last one you' il get for a long time .
you joined the marines to fight and you' il get your chance .
i' il show you how .
if i can' t teach you one way , i' il teach you another .
but i' il get the job done .
the skipper of this outfit is captain joyce .
platoon leader is lieutenant baker .
platoon sergeant is sergeant wright .
any questions ?
that' s all .
10, 000 sergeants in this corps and i draw stryker !
you knew this guy before ?
yeah .
we were stationed together in china .
twice he kept me from promotion .
turned me in once .
30 days i got .
he was a sergeant major then .
must have done something to get busted to three stripes .
what did he turn you in for ?
for ...
that' s not important !
what' s important is that he turned me in !
maybe he didn' t write the manual , but you can bet he can recite it backwards !
it' s probably tattooed on his chest .
front and back , mac .
say , isn' t your name al thomas ?
yeah .
weren' t you a fighter ?
just in the marines .
runner up in the heavyweight division .
tell him who you were runner up to .
stryker .
lucky punch .
meet your new manager .
tell him why you lost your stripes .
my natural dislike for you is gradually developing into a great hate .
don' t let this guy do your thinking .
you' il get a square deal from stryker .
you bet .
square deal .
i' m looking forward to the first time he and i come head to head off duty .
hey , take it easy with that hand , champ !
saddle up !
all right , take a break .
take a break .
how does your squad look ?
see me in about six months .
conway !
i was checking the records .
your father was colonel sam conway .
what if he was ?
i was with him ten months ago .
he was my co before he got killed .
one of the best officers and finest men i ever served under .
i thought if you ...
thanks .
i' il keep it in mind .
for that , you sleep with your rifle .
it was an accident .
nobody in this outfit drops their rifle .
fall in !
all right , saddle up .
pick it up .
sometimes i don' t know which i hate worse , him or the nips .
your father was a good marine .
until ten months ago .
you shipped in when he was killed .
i shipped in because i was expected to .
in war the men of my family join the marines .
i' m the last conway , so here i am .
he' d be proud that you' re carrying on the tradition .
not my father .
he' d have expected me to find some soft duty somewhere .
in fact , he told me so .
i don' t get it .
i embarrassed my father .
i wasn' t tough enough for him .
too soft .
no guts " was the phrase he used .
he wanted me to be like stryker .
the finest man i ever served under .
i bet they got along just fine .
both with ramrods strapped on their backs .
i' m a civilian , not a marine .
they' re not going to strap one on mine .
i' m in here strictly for tradition .
that the only reason ?
yeah .
why ?
nothing ...
stryker knows his business .
so did jack the ripper .
knock off the skylarking .
you' re in the wrong column .
left foot close in there .
look alive !
choynski , you' re all left feet !
choynski !
what do you think you' re doing ?
running the bayonet course , sir .
not in this league .
yes , sir .
your men are pretty ragged , stryker .
yes , sir .
that ought to take some starch out of stryker .
his boys didn' t do so well .
hanging him up between those poles , we' d do a lot better .
choynski !
ok , so i' m left handed .
on guard .
give me your rifle .
what is this ?
you can' t learn the easy way , you' il learn the hard way .
make a thrust .
without a scabbard ?
you heard me .
you mean this way ?
yeah , like this !
you get the idea ?
corpsman !
all right , saddle up .
we' il do it again .
pick it up .
you' re the only unkissable guy in camp .
this thing hurts .
it ain' t funny .
no dame' s going to come near a mouth like this .
don' t worry , i got the scoop .
no liberty for three months .
you got time .
three months ?
how did you get that ?
i got spies everywhere .
they ought to throw the book at stryker for doing this .
they won' t .
they' il give him a citation for teaching us to be good marines .
choynski !
they tell me you' re going to live .
you were lucky today .
someone had been instructing you that didn' t like you , you might not have been .
you better put in a little homework on that bayonet course .
somebody who didn' t like me ?
i wonder what he does to the guys he hates .
365 days in a year and i gotta pick this one to nick myself !
you need a blow torch on your stubble .
look who' s putting out the scuttlebutt .
no liberty , he says !
somebody made a mistake .
you got no kick coming .
you have , so don' t go turning your back .
will we take hollywood with them physiques !
first platoon !
that' s for me !
here , wright , any mail for stryker ?
no .
it' s going to be rugged again tonight .
he won' t solve his problems with whiskey .
what would you do if your wife left with your kid ?
after five years i' d forget it .
stryker' s not much on forgetting .
sorry , no letter for you .
i know it .
you know ten year olds .
there could be a thousand reasons why he didn' t write .
a million .
cut it out .
cut what out ?
brushing me .
the kid' s all right .
maybe mary influenced him not to .
that she wouldn' t do .
of course not .
stryker , you' re a very unusual character .
can this be love ?
you know what i mean .
a lot of guys wouldn' t see that a woman needs a husband who' s not always away .
a woman wants a home and a guy to come in and out on time every day .
you can tell me to shut up .
if you can' t talk to me , who can ?
don' t do it , just for once , don' t do it .
do what ?
don' t start out to get blind , staggering , stinking , falling down drunk .
nobody starts out to get blind , staggering , stinking , falling down drunk .
some do .
why not leave half your dough with me ?
you got an old maid' s failings .
you worry .
don' t try to follow me tonight or i' il put a dent in that ugly head of yours .
ready ?
just a minute .
what' s up ?
nothing .
benny didn' t strip his m1 fast enough for stryker , so he turned him in .
they cancelled his liberty .
perhaps our sergeant hasn' t got a heart of gold after all , but he certainly is ...
you talk too much .
you think i restricted flynn for my own amusement ?
the punishment' s unreasonable , to cancel his liberty for a minor mistake .
i' m gonna tell you something , conway .
i' m gonna tell all of you .
i' m gonna make it simple so you' il all understand it .
they handed me you guys as a present , a regular easter basket .
they told me to get you into shape so you can handle a piece of this war .
that' s what i' m gonna do and that means i' m gonna tell you what to do every day , how to button your buttons and when to blow your noses .
if you do something i don' t like i' m gonna jump and when i land it' il hurt .
i' il ride you until you can' t stand up .
when you do , you' il be marines .
flynn stays here .
extra hard product of a hard school .
tough luck , flynn .
if my brother doesn' t go , i' m not going .
shut up !
who are you telling to shut up ?
you !
let' s go before we all lose our liberty .
i wanna see those wellington babes .
how do you feel , boy ?
like a little bird with feathers on it .
don' t fly away , little bird .
i can' t .
i' m still in the egg .
beautiful , beautiful !
i wanna dance .
you' re gonna sit down .
yes , ma' am , tennessee , that' s where i come from .
the greatest state in the union .
they call it the volunteer state .
right there is where i' m from .
smithville , tennessee , what a town !
these are all my cousins on my mama' s side and these are on my papa' s side .
we got the best tobacco there is , too .
more fertiliser comes from tennessee than any other place in the world .
listen to that band !
zombies !
they' re all dead .
maybe they like music that way here .
or don' t know any other kind .
i' m talking these boys into a session .
maybe they don' t have it in them .
after i' m through , they will .
they' re breaking my heart .
beautiful , beautiful , beautiful !
there is a happy man .
wait until tomorrow .
don' t be a killjoy , dance .
i' il watch him .
i' m not much on dancing .
you might try just this once .
no , thanks .
pete' s my name , pete conway .
allison .
hello , allison .
hello , pete .
you' re warm .
want to sit down ?
no .
i don' t want to lose you .
cutting in .
shove off , mac .
what would you say if i suggested we get some air ?
i' d say i' m not supposed to leave the club with servicemen , but to you i' d say yes .
now what ?
we know all about each other .
you' il be missing your train .
i' il float back on thin air .
don' t do that .
you might catch cold .
funny , i' ve just met you and i feel i' ve known you all my life .
i feel that way , too .
ten thousand miles away .
not now .
i wanna see you again , every time i get liberty .
i' il be here .
allison ...
yes ? ... l' m glad i met you tonight .
the train ...
i know .
i' il walk you to the station .
i can get a taxi from there .
no , i' il walk you home .
no .
you might miss your train .
i might not see you again for a long time .
any time i get liberty , she says , just call her up .
man , what a barmaid !
i' il finish the war right here .
drink any more and you probably will !
new zealand ain' t got rats because they killed them all with that whiskey !
we' il drink worse before we get through .
they may bury me at sea tomorrow , but tonight i got that nice , warm feeling .
i got a great future for the next two hours .
you' re bleeding !
lipstick !
hey , fellas , look what i found !
hey , sports ... ... look .
boy , he' s really carrying a load !
gyrene !
hey , mac , you' re a little off your course .
well , what do you know !
stryker .
he' s sure a mess .
now i know what happened to those stripes .
come on .
shore patrol .
that' s what it is .
give me a hand .
you' re going to help him ?
if he cut my mother' s throat five minutes ago , i wouldn' t let them get him .
what a break !
he' s all set to drop two stripes and shore patrol shows up .
but look what he done to me !
don' t tell me he kissed you .
that' s a great one !
did i tell you about the guy on a train and the funniest thing happened ...
i don' t know why you' re helping him .
i' il take care of it .
where did you come from ?
never mind .
he don' t need you guys .
how do you like that ?
he must follow stryker like a little dog .
what do you care ?
at least he took him off our hands .
a day after our leave , we drew a 22 mile hike over terrain carefully selected .
all uphill , and it was a weary bunch of marines who pitched tents that night and gratefully folded themselves inside .
do you believe in love at first sight ?
all kinds .
i never did before but i sure do now .
why do you have to tell me now ?
because i' m thinking about it now .
i' m gonna marry that girl .
what girl ?
the girl i met last night .
you' il feel better in the morning .
i couldn' t feel any better than i do right now .
i' ve been thinking , why do men get married during a war ?
don' t know .
it' s the worst time .
i fooled around but i never thought about marriage .
i know a lot of girls back in the states but ... ... i think it' s because when you get out here you' re close to things .
you realise way down inside , no matter how much you try not to think about it , that maybe something' s got your number on ... ... and you want to leave a bit of yourself behind .
doesn' t matter if it' s a boy or a girl , just so long as you won' t be forgotten .
there' il be someone who' d never have lived if it hadn' t been for you .
am i right ?
i think i' m right .
hey , conway , got a pass ?
i have .
all right , hop in .
i' il give you a lift .
i hear you got a girl in town .
what if i have ?
they say she' s a very nice girl .
they talk too much .
are you serious about her ?
with things the way they are , this is no time to start getting serious with a girl .
don' t know how long you' re gonna be here or when you' il be back again .
don' t even know how long you' il live .
if it' s in the line of duty , you can tell me to do something and i' il do it .
as for my personal life , keep your hands off .
your father would' ve said it .
i wouldn' t have listened .
you never did .
how do you know ?
he told me .
what did he say ?
i' il tell you .
he said i was a disappointment , right ?
he said i wouldn' t be able to stand up for myself , right ?
you' re doing the talking .
no , my father is .
every time you open your mouth , he' s talking .
every thought you think is his .
it' s as though he' s at my shoulder .
but he didn' t always say or think the right thing .
you' re gonna find that out when the time comes .
until then leave me alone .
you want a lift or not ?
yeah , sure .
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
why ?
you' ve hardly said a word .
you' re right .
i' ve been thinking .
about us ?
myself .
that' s selfish .
honey , do you think i' m a brave man ?
what a funny question to ask .
well , do you ?
i don' t know .
why ?
i' ve got to prove something to someone .
who ?
you don' t know him .
he' s dead now .
yes , pete , i think you' re brave .
that helps .
you don' t know how much that helps .
let' s not talk about it any more .
we should have been talking about ourselves all this time , what' s going to happen to us .
what do you want to happen ?
i want to marry you .
i want that , too .
funny , we barely know each other .
we see each other for what seems only moments .
and yet ...
i know what you mean .
choynski , not going to the wedding ?
no .
i' d better get a transfer .
i can' t learn this bayonet business .
i' m all thumbs .
on guard .
no , sarge , not again !
i' m not well from the last time .
on guard !
play that thing again .
you lead .
what ?
you lead !
shift your weight .
left , left !
there .
keep it up .
you' il get the knack of it .
practise that about a half an hour every day .
hey , sarge !
i got it !
i haven' t been in church since i was 14 .
kissing the bride' s a great invention .
sure makes me homesick .
what' s the matter ?
he looks the same .
how do you expect him to look ?
married , wrinkled , worried , like me .
44 hours and 34 minutes left .
go !
excuse me , sports .
here' s your wedding present from the gang .
you' ve all been wonderful .
are you sure you' ve got the right guy ?
i' m sure .
come on , get going !
" sempre felice " , mac !
keep the situation well in hand , pete !
we got 44 hours and 33 minutes .
what are we gonna do ?
al , if i was a girl , i' d marry you .
knock it off !
i' ve had a hard day .
what am i doing ?
44 hours and 32 minutes .
that isn' t very long , is it ?
no , not long at all .
i wonder how many other people have had 44 hours and 32 minutes .
lots i guess .
we' il make it seem a long time .
years .
shall i open it ?
sure , go ahead .
they' re in a hurry !
others were in a hurry .
the order said move out and the marines moved out .
11 days at sea .
destination ?
only the top brass knew .
though , of course , scuttlebutt knew the answer , a hundred answers , all wrong .
boat squad ... halt , one , two !
dismissed !
too bad you couldn' t see her again .
you didn' t get long .
we knew it might happen .
i' il be back .
i' ve got to believe that .
sure .
we' il all be back .
gangway !
that' s no way to carry a flag , regazzi .
i' ve got to teach you everything .
now watch this ...
what are you gonna do with this , benny ?
i' m gonna put that up in tokyo , right in the middle of times square .
there isn' t any times square in tokyo .
there will be when i get there .
now that' s the way to fold a flag , with the blue field showing .
what do you know !
you got my shirt !
it' s my shirt !
i' m telling you , it' s my shirt !
it' s my shirt !
here , fellas .
you' d better quit fighting so much .
if you don' t , one of you' s apt to get hurt .
corpsman !
corpsman !
what' s that ?
relax .
it' s the navy clearing its throat .
sure don' t sound like no squirrel gun .
i hope they practise real good .
what island do you think we' re aiming at ?
we' il get word .
here it is .
it looks like a pork chop .
what' s its name ?
tarawa .
never heard of it .
it' s the wrong place .
it' s part of an atoll called tarawa atoll .
this particular island is called betio .
don' t ask me how you spell it .
you' il have to stick your faces into it but you don' t have to spell it .
this is red beach three .
that' s us .
what have they got there ?
everything .
this island' s held by a special naval landing force .
that means japanese marines .
they' re dug in and they' re mean .
they' d just as soon die as stick a nickel in a jukebox , but that' s all right .
let the other guy die for his country .
you' il live for yours .
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
get over there .
i can hear him .
get over there .
i don' t want anybody hurt because you didn' t listen .
schoolteacher , do me some homework .
what' s your problem , son ?
put down 5, 000 .
scuttlebutt says that' s how many nips are on that rock .
the navy fired 1, 000 tons of shells .
don' t forget the fly fly boys .
those b 24s have really been working them over .
now add the tons of explosives , divide it by the nips and get the answer .
maybe we' il be back for noon chow .
don' t figure that way .
the navy and the fly fly boys unloaded plenty on the canal before we went in .
when we got ashore there were still a lot of those lemon coloured guys waiting .
only way that island was taken was by putting marines on the beach .
you' ve heard the naval foray' s a waste of time and metal .
stryker knows better .
who cut you in on this conversation ?
you say when i can and can' t talk ?
just when you can' t talk to me .
knock it off , conway .
i' ve had enough of your " hardbitten sergeant " attitude .
you' re so big everybody' s been afraid to take a punch at you .
i' m not !
cool off !
forget that pencil and paper routine and worry about staying alive on that beach .
don' t expect any soft touch !
" now hear this " !
all troops report to your debarking stations !
all right , men , sound off when your name' s called .
now hear this , there' il be no movies tonight !
the place is opened up for business .
missed !
maybe they' re firing blanks .
maybe a two headed kid' s aiming .
maybe this is just manoeuvres .
get out now .
we' re crossing the line of departure .
lock and load !
good luck , sarge !
charlie , give me a hand here !
lieutenant , hit the deck !
how is it ?
i got hit !
corpsman !
you' il be all right .
they got us pinned down !
we can' t get over these logs !
i' m going while i can !
stay here , kid !
we' re gonna be killed here .
i' d like to get at them !
why rush ?
this is a nice place .
they got the lieutenant !
they' il get all of us if we don' t move .
we are like fish in a barrel lying here .
did we train to take it lying down ?
sarge , do something about it !
stay where you are until i tell you .
you gotta get us out of here !
if you' re nervous count your toes .
i' il do the masterminding around here .
where' s lieutenant baker ?
machine gunned .
is your squad all right ?
all but one .
what' s holding us down ?
that bunker , an old power plant .
all these bombs and they' re still killing us .
smoke , sir ?
thanks .
i' ve sent for flame throwers to assist .
your squad will support .
follow me !
you heard !
move out and stay down !
we' ve gotta silence that bunker !
request naval gunfire be lifted on target areas , coordinates ... ... two four six zero sugar tare .
over .
roger and out .
flame throwers out !
demolition in !
demolition out !
shipley !
give me a hand with this pack .
throw it !
move out !
get him out of there !
there goes one of your nine .
now we got tanks .
better late than never .
come on !
corpsman !
corpsman !
this way !
don' t wait .
they' il find me .
keep going .
hit ' em for me .
find stryker .
stick with him .
he' s good people .
tell him i ...
i' d like to know where the rest of the squad went .
what' s this place ?
whatever it is it ain' t healthy !
let' s go !
that was close .
next time don' t be in such a hurry .
you' re across , ain' t you ?
across what ?
to where ?
i' m running low on ammo .
i am too .
forgot about that .
we gotta get some more .
i' il go .
wait !
pick a number from one to six .
two .
five .
you' re both wrong .
that guy kills me .
thomas better hurry !
how about some bandoliers , mac ?
help yourself .
how are things going up front ?
pretty rough .
keep it coming .
good luck .
is that coffee ?
it sure is .
do you want some ?
do i want some , he says !
i haven' t had any joe since we left the ship .
you mortarmen sure live the life of riley here .
here you are .
beautiful !
where' s thomas ?
probably dead .
no , not that guy .
let' s get out of here !
can i have some for my buddies ?
sure .
break out your canteen .
tell me , how' s everything been going ?
couldn' t be better , mac .
oh , this is the life !
come and get it , you guys !
ammo and fresh hot joe !
hellenopolis !
bass !
hey , greek !
hey , greek !
what kepts you , thomas ?
where' s bass ?
gutted .
no ammo .
what kept you , sports ?
major crowe , sir .
jim ?
how you doing ?
" it' s tough going , dave " .
i' ve committed every man .
we' re dug in and staying .
good .
i' ve been getting reports all day that the nips are slipping in to your front .
if it' s " banzai " tonight , target area 2 41 is a hot spot .
what outfit have you got there ?
joyce and stryker .
pass the word they gotta dig in and stay put .
no noise or movement .
don' t risk anybody unless you have to .
hold on until we get more men there .
yes , sir .
major crowe says the nips have been filtering into these tank traps .
disperse your squad along this section .
tell your men there' s to be no smoking , no moving or unnecessary talking .
if they find out how thin we are , they can get to the beach .
that' s a platoon area .
all i got' s a beat up squad , short three men .
couldn' t you ... ?
can i give you three men ?
the battalion can' t give the whole company three replacements .
your squad is covering the hottest spot in the line .
if it' s an attack tonight they' il strike you first .
they want to know our disposition .
i repeat , your men are not to move .
aye , aye , sir .
stryker , we' re going to hold this line .
aye , aye , sir .
good luck .
all right , saddle up .
follow me .
everybody go !
drop off at intervals , two man foxholes .
we' re gonna be spread out thin tonight .
don' t give away your position or strength .
you flynns stay here , and no quarrels .
dunne and smith , drop out here .
no gab tonight !
you and harris here !
come on , conway .
corpsman !
listen .
corpsman !
that' s a marine .
corpsman !
stryker !
get down and stay down !
you had your orders !
somebody' s wounded !
quiet .
let' s get him !
stay down !
it may be an old jap trick .
they pulled it on the canal .
it doesn' t sound like a jap to me .
i don' t care .
you' il tip our position .
stryker !
it' s bass !
how many japs know your name ?
you know his voice .
shut up .
aren' t you human at all ?

mike mchugh , from cedar rapids to see this war' s over in a hurry .
how old are you ?

how old ?
well , eighteen ... going on eighteen .
we heard that the squad leader' s tough .
there are rumours to that effect .
tough sergeants roll off my knife !
you' re gonna find your first few days with sergeant stryker very interesting .
you new men come with me .
attention !
charlie !
how are you ?
certified fit for duty , so the medics say .
good .
the replacements came up with me .
they get younger all the time .
or we' re getting older .

i can stand having you back .
i can stand being back .
what happened to the squad , besides the greek , shipley and thomas ?
choynski ...
thomas ?
he never got a scratch .
i was sure he got it .

when we got stuck in a trench he went back to get ammo .
never came back .
how long between the time he went back and you got overrun ?
about 40 minutes .
40 minutes ?

you haven' t had enough .

that' s debatable .
you know it' s not permissible for an nco to strike a man ?
yes , sir .
who struck the first blow ?
colonel , there wasn' t any first blow struck exactly .
a simultaneous explosion perhaps ?
judo , sir .
the sergeant was showing me how to break a judo hold .
no more judo exhibitions .

aye , aye , sir .
at least you' re no stool pigeon .
wait a minute , stryker .
i' m wrong , dead wrong .
i know it .
i doped off for some coffee , but i didn' t think a few minutes mattered .
it did !
i know that now , but i didn' t then .
it' s killing me .
i can' t sleep .
a hundred times i wanted to tell you , tell somebody .
i ...
i liked that greek ...
i' d do anything for him .
if i could i' d change him for me right now .
i think you would .
guys make mistakes but every one we make , a stack of chips goes with it .
we make a mistake and some guy don' t walk away !
for evermore he don' t walk away .
i guess all we can do is just take it ... ... and hope we don' t make the same mistake again .
i won' t .
let' s get back .

i' m a troop .
they' re all such nice boys .
there' s a lieutenant here ... " a lieutenant !
when i get back she' il need standing up for a month !
i put on muscle lately !
darling , this is a funny way for a man to find out he' s a father , but you are .
it happened the day before yesterday , just in time for breakfast .
he' s a boy and looks beautiful like me and intelligent like you .
i should have told you it was going to happen , but i didn' t want to worry you .
i don' t know what to call him .
we never discussed that .
i' m a father !
hey , i' m a father !
let' s see !
i' m a father !
all right , let' s fall in !
come on !
finally we got our leave .
ten days in honolulu .
all of us were out on the town .

he was still the same .
lonesome ?
drift .
whiskey .

please .
ok .
thanks .
a drink' il be good .
i' m tired .
it' s been a rough day ...
knock it off !
i' m sorry , sergeant .

thanks .
65 cents for a drink .
it' s too much .
they cheat servicemen .
we could drink cheaper at my house .
don' t throw your arm out of joint .
thanks for the drink .
i didn' t mean to make too much buzzing in your ear .
it' s all right , finish your drink .
i didn' t mean to sound so tough .
i know .
you' re just unhappy .
me , too .
my name' s mary .
the long arm of coincidence , or something .
her name , too .
that invitation still hold ?
make yourself comfortable .
i' il fix us a drink .
oh , dear !
well , i can get us some more in a jiffy .
i see .

mummy' s fixing you something .
her boy' il be quiet while she has company .
knock it off ...
where' s his father ?

well , i guess into each life a little rain must fall .
there are a lot tougher ways of making a living than going to war .
you know about babies .
yeah , i know about babies .
so long , mac .
wait !
i can' t spend it on a coral reef .
you' re a very good man .
you' il get odds on that in the marines .
so long .
so long , sergeant .
i' il pray for you .
let' s not get religion .
i' il pray for you , sergeant !
good luck .
you got a lot of bloodhound in you , charlie , but you can call off the dogs .
i' m smarter than i was 30 minutes ago .
catch me feeling sorry for myself again and you got my permission to belt me in the nose !
buy you a drink ?
lock and load , boy !
thanks !
two bourbon and ice .
a baby' s a big event .
conway !
treating the boys ?
crack open the hatch !
that' s great .
a fellow always gets more kick out of a boy , i guess .
i got a kid .
sam , i named him ... ... after your old man .
wait till he gets to be ten and doesn' t write .
you' il be mad enough to hit him .
no , i won' t , stryker , because he won' t have to write .
i' il be where he is .
and i won' t insist that he be tough .
i' il try to make him intelligent .
and i won' t insist that he read the marine corps manual .
i' il get him shakespeare .
i don' t want him to be a colonel conway or sergeant stryker .
i want him to be intelligent , considerate , cultured and a gentleman .
you' re out of line , kid .
let him be .
he has a right to dislike me .
thanks , and i intend to exercise that right .
i don' t like you , stryker .
let' s talk sense for a minute , conway .
i can' t have friction in the squad .
i' ve tried every approach to you that i know .
got nowhere .
you' re intelligent ...
don' t patronise me .
your opinion of my iq doesn' t interest me in the least .
let' s get this straight .
on duty i jump when you holler .
off duty i exercise my god given rights under a democracy and dislike whom i please .
do we understand each other ?
beat it .
come on , you guys , let' s go .
i don' t understand why you don' t belt him .
mellow in my old age , i guess .
too bad .
screaming sam " couldn' t be proud of him .
he could .
there' s something inside a guy , always proud of a kid .
two more ?
not for me .
i' il sail again .
one .
ok .
maybe you can steer me home ?
charge !
pull pins !
prepare to throw !
throw !
all right , fifth relay !
what an arm !
pick it up !
right in the groove !
look , boy , this is a live grenade .
gee !
you know what they can do ?
yes , sir .
right hand .
wait for the order to pull pin and pitch grenade .
got it ?
yes , sir .
ready ?
pull pin !
prepare to throw !
throw !
grenade !
hit the deck !
when will you wake up ?
you wanna see her again , keep your mind on your work !
what happened here ?
little accident , sir .
you' re wounded .
corpsman !
yes , sir .
take care of the sergeant .
come right over here , sergeant .
you may not know it , but you just got your life saved .
you' il get a medal .
again the word came and the marines moved out .
again scuttlebutt knew a hundred destinations , all wrong .
this time we were a sound fighting unit , blooded and trained .
tarawa had blooded us .
stryker had trained us .
now , i' il show you something .
what you got there ?
what does it look like ?
a flag .
what are you gonna do with it ?
occupy this island in the usa' s name .
you think we' il have an easy time ?
you got me with you .
maybe we need two of you .
one was enough in tarawa .
stick with me .
i' m a battle hardened veteran .
know how many japs i knocked off in tarawa ?
32 .
did i get anything for it ?
i got enemies in washington .
if the marines didn' t have me , they' d never have made it .
now , this is how you fold a flag !
do you believe in intuition ?
yeah ... in women .
why ?
it' s hard to explain .
i' ve a feeling i' m not coming out of this operation .
don' t talk that way .
i can' t help it .
it' s the way i feel .
why ?
i don' t know .
it' s like a voice in my ear .
i can' t shake the feeling off .
take my advice , shake it off .
no dice .
when things like that get in you , it' s no use trying to fight them .
if a marine waits long enough he gets the word .
our sealed orders came aboard after five days at sea .
this island is volcanic and sandy .
it' s five and a half miles long and two and a half miles wide .
this mountain here is a dead volcano .
it' s called suribachi .
there' s nothing on the island except three airfields and about 20, 000 japs .
the army air corps b 24s have been bombing this place for 62 days .
maybe it' il be an easy operation then .
we can' t be sure .
every yard is covered by some kind of fire .
there are two possible landing beaches , one on the east side , one on the west .
the rest of the coastline is cliffs .
they' il try and keep us off the beaches .
if they don' t , they' il try and catch us at this first airfield , between the heights of suribachi and these high rocky ridges in the north .
they' il shell us from both sides .
nobody knows what they' ve got on this island .
but they' ve had 40 years to put it there .
saipan was our last stop .
the men who were going to hit the beach first transferred to ls ts .
a few more days at sea and the time for landing came .
saddle up !
skip along and into the amtracs .
anyway , it' s a good day for it .
it' s cold .
stick around , it' il get warm .
yeah , that' s what i' m afraid of .
hey , look !
driver , you the joker that wrote that ?
" semper fi " , mac !
we should take you in along with us .
hey , mchugh' s going in with his pocket full of books !
five books he' s got !
so ?
the kid' s a reader .
that shouldn' t worry a dope like you .
when we' re through with this operation , i' m gonna break both your legs !
i feel sick .
i know .
i felt the same way at tarawa .
hey , stein , " shalom aleychem " .
aleychem shalom .
sarge , i' m scared .
so am i.
not you !
fowler , i' m always scared .
line of departure !
get down !
lock and load !
drop those lifebelts when we hit the beach !
all right , hit the beach !
it ain' t brooklyn !
if this place was a blanket i' d pull it over my head !
this is the poorest soil i ever saw .
what does anyone want an island like this for ?
that' s war .
what' s war ?
trading real estate for men .
when god made the world , he must have put all the rubbish left over here .
corpsman !
corpsman !
take it easy .
doggone it , almost the same place they got me before !
getting shot for this !
they' re sure pouring it into suribachi .
not enough .
those nips are shooting right down our throats .
stryker !
yo !
lieutenant shrier wants to see you .
lieutenant shrier ?
stand fast .
stryker reporting , sir .
i know .
your platoon' s been hit hard .
what' s left has been assigned to me .
yes , sir .
naval gunfire lifts at 1100 .
stand by .
aye , aye .
move out !
keep your distance !
go on , go on !
corpsman !
corpsman !
corpsman !
spread out !
dig in !
dunne , where' s my brother ?
back there .
he' s hit .
flynn !
that' s enough !
i told you you' d need this bad some day .
thanks , marine .
flynn !
get down !
you ain' t got the sense of a rabbit !
you can still be a hero crawling !
corpsman !
ma' il dust me off if i don' t get him back !
harris !
well , i' il get a good night' s sleep tonight .
corpsman !
he won' t need him .
pillbox too big to handle with these .
a bazooka ?
if we had one .
i got nothing to do .
i' il go pick one up .
regazzi didn' t make it .
you never know what' s happening .
listen .
it' s a tank .
yeah , but whose ?
ours !
it' s regazzi .
pillbox at 2 o' clock .
ok , give ' em a hot foot !
thanks , mac .
i couldn' t find a bazooka .
you did all right .
saddle up !
no one had ever seen anything like it .
no one would have believed it possible .
that smoking , miserable , bloody island .
after three days and three nights , and at the end of that time , we' d barely reached the foot of suribachi , where we were the first day .
we' il sack here for the night .
best news today .
pair off and one man awake at all times .
keep alert .
let' s go .
it' il start getting rough tomorrow against suribachi .
it started getting rough when you put on that uniform .
you wanna see a good looking kid ?
husky little boot .
what' s his name ?
we' re gonna name him sam , sam conway .
a name that' s been awarded the navy cross is good enough for any kid .
there' s something i' ve been trying to say but ...
i can' t find the words .
two universities and you can' t find the words to say you were out of line ?
ok , i' m out of line .
no , you were .
there' s a difference .
we' d better get some sack time .
wanna sleep first or watch ?
i' il watch .
ok .
everybody gets out of line once in a while .
thanks , gyrene .
where' s sergeant stryker ?
stryker ?
right there .
what do you want ?
lieutenant shrier wants to see you .
stryker , sir .
yes , sir .
i' m taking a patrol up suribachi .
get your men squared away and be ready at 0700 .
the rendezvous is that nip tank there .
aye , aye , sir , 0700 .
that little voice whispering in your ear again ?
don' t worry .
i' ve known a million guys that have heard it .
most of them make it .
a few don' t .
the percentage is on your side .
did you ever hear it ?
no .
don' t you ever worry about it ?
what good would it do ?
you' re indestructible .
stick close .
it might rub off !
i' il do that .
banner three , this is easy five .
patrol is ready to move .
request supporting fire .
ow !
sh' ma yisrael , adonai elohenu ... adonai echad .
amen .
radio !
banner three , this is easy five .
over .
this is easy five .
cease fire , we' re preparing to move over the top .
roger and out .
stryker !
yes , sir .
colonel' s ordered that we put up this flag when the top' s secure .
get it there .
aye , aye , sir .
what is this ?
put yours away .
this is the one we' re gonna use .
first squad .
find something we can use as a standard and we' il put this up .
conway , you made it .
i guess that little voice was wrong .
i feel better .
i feel better , too .
i never felt so good in my life .
how about a cigarette ?
is he ... ?
yeah .
if he had to get it it' s the way he' d have wanted .
it' s a letter to his kid .
dear son , i guess none of my letters have reached you .
i thought i' d try again as i' m feeling
that this may be the last time i can write you .
for a long time i' ve wanted to tell you many things .
now that you' re a big boy , i will .
if we' d been together even for a while ,
i could' ve explained many things much better than writing them .
you' ve gotta take care of your mother , and love her and make her happy .
never hurt her or anyone as i did .
always do what your heart tells you is right .
maybe someone will write you some day and tell you about me .
i want you to be like me in some things , but not like me in others .
when you grow older and get to know more about me , you' il see i' ve failed ... " ... in many ways .
this isn' t what i wanted but things just turned out that way .
if there was only more time i ...
guess he never finished it .
i' il finish it for him .
there she goes .
all right , saddle up !
let' s get back in the war !
