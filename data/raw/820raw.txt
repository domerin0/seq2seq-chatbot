on september 3rd 1973 at 6 : 28pm and 32 seconds , a bluebottle fly capable of 14, 670 wing beats a minute
landed on rue st vincent , montmartre .
at the same moment , on a restaurant terrace nearby , the wind magically made two glasses dance unseen on a tablecloth .
meanwhile , in a 5th floor flat , 28 avenue trudaine , paris 9 , returning from his best friend' s funeral , eugene colere erased his name from his address book .
at the same moment , a sperm with one x chromosome , belonging to raphal poulain , made a dash for an egg in his wife amandine .
nine months later ,
amlie poulain was born .
her father , an ex army doctor , works at a spa in enghien les bains .
peeing next to someone else .
catching scornful glances at his sandals .
clingy wet swimming trunks .
peeling off large strips of wallpaper .
lining up all his shoes and polishing them .
emptying his tool box , cleaning it out , and putting everything back .
amlie' s mother , amandine , a schoolmistress from gueugnon , has always had shaky nerves .
getting puckered fingers in the bath .
when someone she doesn' t like brushes against her hand .
pillow marks on her cheek in the morning .
figure skaters' costumes on tv .
polishing the parquet with slippers .
emptying her handbag , cleaning it out , and putting everything back .
amlie is six .
like all little girls , she' d like to be hugged by her daddy .
but he never touches her , except for a monthly checkup .
the thrill of this rare contact makes her heart beat like a drum .
as a result , he thinks she has a heart defect .
declared unfit for school ,
amlie is taught by her mother .
four ... hens ... brood ... here ... henceforth .
four hens brood ...
very good . ... hens fourth !
no !
deprived of playmates , tossed about between a neurotic and an iceberg ,
amlie retreats into her imagination .
in this world , lps are made like pancakes .
the neighbour' s comatose wife has chosen to get all her life' s sleep in one go .
after this , i can stay awake day and night .
amlie has one friend , blubber .
alas , the home environment has made blubber suicidal .
blubber' s suicide attempts destroy mother' s nerves .
a decision is made .
enough !
to comfort amlie , her mother gives her a second hand instamatic camera .
little girl !
look what you did !
a neighbour fools her into thinking her camera causes accidents .
because she' d been taking pictures all afternoon , amlie is petrified .
she stares at the tv , racked by the guilt of causing a huge fire , two derailments and ajumbojet crash .
a few days later , realising she' d been had ,
amlie gets her revenge .
what ... ?
one day tragedy strikes .
amandine takes amlie to notre dame to light a candle and pray for a baby brother .
three minutes later , heaven sends , alas , not a baby boy , but marguerite , a tourist from quebec , bent on ending her life .
amandine poulain is killed instantly .
after her mother' s death , amlie lives alone with her father .
his unsociable tendencies increase .
he' s obsessed with building a miniature shrine to house his wife' s ashes .
days , months and years go by .
in such a dead world ,
amlie prefers to dream until she' s old enough to leave home .
five years later , she' s a waitress in montmartre at the two windmills .
it is august 29th .
in 48 hours , her life will change for ever .
but she doesn' t know it yet .
she lives quietly among her colleagues and the caf' s regulars .
that' s suzanne , the owner .
she limps a little but she' s never spilt a drink .
when she was younger , she was a circus rider .
she likes athletes who cry with disappointment .
she dislikes seeing men humiliated in front of their kids in her caf .
georgette is the tobacconist .
she' s a hypochondriac .
migraines one day , sciatica the next .
she hates the words
fruit of thy womb " .
gina works with amlie .
her grandmother was a healer .
she likes cracking bones .
she' s bringing a kir to hipolito , a failed writer .
he likes seeing bullfighters gored on tv .
scowling at them is joseph , gina' s rejected lover .
he' s alwaysjealously spying on her .
all he likes is popping bubble wrap .
and here' s philomene , an air hostess .
amlie looks after her cat rodrigue when she' s away .
philomene likes the sound of the cat' s bowl on the tiles .
rodrigue likes overhearing children' s stories .
no , thanks , ma' am .
i never work on sundays .
at weekends , amlie often takes a train from the gare du nord to see her father .
why don' t you use your retirement to ... ?
to do what ?
travel .
you' ve never been away .
when we were young , your mother and i longed to travel .
but we couldn' t .
because of your heart .
yes .
i know .
so now ...
now ...
some friday evenings , amlie goes to the cinema .
i like turning round and looking at people' s faces in the dark .
i like noticing details that no one else ever sees .
but i hate it in old american movies when drivers don' t watch the road .
amlie doesn' t have a boyfriend .
she tried once or twice , but the results were a let down .
instead , she cultivates a taste for small pleasures .
plunging her hand deep into a sack of grain .
cracking creme brule with a teaspoon .
and skimming stones on the canal st martin .
they call him the glass man .
he was born with bones as brittle as crystal .
all his furniture is padded .
a handshake would be enough to crush his fingers .
he' s stayed indoors for 20 years .
time has changed nothing .
amlie still takes refuge in solitude .
how many couples are having an orgasm now ?
fifteen .
finally , on the night of august 30th 1997 , comes the event that will change her life for ever .
lady di , princess of wales , died in a car crash in paris last night with her companion dodi al fayed ...
only the first man to discover tutankhamen' s tomb would understand how she felt on finding this treasure hidden by a little boy 40 years ago .
on august 31st at 4am ,
amlie has a dazzling idea .
wherever he was , she would find the box' s owner and give him back his treasure .
if he was touched , she' d become a regular do gooder .
if not , too bad .
the girl from the 5th floor !
we don' t see much of you .
would you know of a boy who lived in my flat in the ' 50s ?
a boy ?
come and have a glass of port .
no , thanks .
come in !
close the door .
boys ?
i' ve known so many .
they' re cute until they discover snowballs and chestnuts .
i' ve known so many boys .
when did you come here ?
in ' 64 .
you' il have heard the story .
no , i don' t think so .
i' m amazed .
sit down .
my husband worked for ladybird insurance .
it' s no secret that he slept with his secretary .
they used every hotel around .
not the grotty ones , either .
the bimbo liked spreading her legs , but only on satin .
so my husband swiped from the till .
a little at first , then 50 million . off they flew to south america .
drink up .
on january 20th 1970 , my doorbell rang .
your husband' s been killed in a car crash in south america .
my life stopped there .
and black lion died of heartbreak .
poor creature .
see how lovingly he still stares at his master ?
one day
i' il read you his letters .
no , don' t go !
you can spare five minutes .
he wrote this from the barracks .
darling mado . " that' s me .
i' m called madeleine .
i can' t sleep , can' t eat , knowing that my only reason to live is far away in paris .
i won' t see her until a fortnight on friday , when my sweet little weasel appears at the station in her strappy blue dress .
the one you think is too transparent .
has anyone ever written to you like that ?
no .
i' m nobody' s little weasel .
my name' s madeleine wells .
madeleine , like mary magdalene .
she wept , right ?
and wells as in water .
talk about being born to cry !
about your question ...
ask collignon , the grocer .
he' s lived here all his life .
hello , amlie mellow !
a fig and three hazelnuts , as usual ?
who lived in my flat in the ' 50s ?
what was their name ?
you' ve got me there , dear .
in 1950 , i was two .
the mental age of this cretin .
the " cretin " is lucien .
he' s no genius , but amlie likes him .
she likes the way he handles each endive like a precious object to be treated with care .
it' s his way of showing his love of good work .
look at him !
like he' s nursing a baby bird that' s fallen out of its nest !
don' t ask him for currants !
you' d be here till monday !
get moving , spastic !
she hasn' t got all day .
here .
go and see my mother .
she has the memory of an elephant .
elephant mum !
thank you .
bredoteau .
sorry ?
it' s the name you' re after .
but if it' s me that says so , it won' t count .
i' m senile .
ignore him .
he' s senile .
see what he' s done to my laurel ?
his old job was punching mtro tickets .
for three months now , he' s got up every night to punch holes
in my laurels !
i' d have preferred lilacs .
such is life !
we all need a way to relax .
i skim stones .
you do ?
i' il find it .
don' t worry .
i file everything .
like what ?
your son' s nearly 50 and i' m still doing his book keeping .
you were still squeezing his toothpaste at 15 , so it follows .
right .
camus ... 2nd floor on the right .
brossard ...
brossard was on staircase b.
got it !
bredoteau , 5th floor on the right .
they were from the pas de calais .
bredoteau .
what more can i say ?
groping under the photo booth is nino quincampoix .
when amlie lacked playmates , nino had too many .
five miles apart , one dreamed of having a sister , the other a brother to spend all their time with .
hi , dad .
a new friend ?
no , i' ve had him for years .
your mother hated him , so he lived in the tool shed .
there .
let' s reconcile them .
there .
not bad , eh ?
dad , if you found a precious relic from your childhood , how would it make you feel ?
happy ?
sad ?
nostalgic ?
what ?
i didn' t have this gnome when i was a child .
he was a retirement gift from my old regiment .
no , i mean something you hid like a secret treasure .
i should varnish him before autumn .
i' il make some tea .
do you want some ?
breathe in .
hold still .
better now ?
shut the door !
there' s a howling gale .
it' s hardly siberia .
i can see you' re not allergic to car fumes .
i almost coughed up my pleura last night .
coughed up a pleura ?
sure .
what' s on the menu today , suzanne ?
endives au gratin .
they' il have you on your knees , you' il see .
they' re good , then ?
depends where .
if it' s at the toilet ...
not good !
12 : 15 , laughs orgasmically to attract alpha male .
he' s going to drive me berserk !
can' t he give up ?
there are plenty of other bars .
goodbye .
suzanne .
suzanne .
yes .
au gratin " means white sauce , right ?
yes , why ?
i can' t stomach it .
like you and horse meat .
it' s not my stomach , it' s my memory .
i' d rather cook human flesh .
you' re kidding !
suzanne , would you mind if i left early today ?
what' s his name ?
dominique bredoteau .
hello .
are you dominique bredoteau ?
that' s me .
why ?
it' s about ... ... the petition .
petition ?
yes .
the petition to ... ... to canonise lady di .
no , thanks .
no .
ladies and gentlemen , sorry to bother you ...
yes ?
hello .
i' m looking for dominique bredoteau for the european census .
come up .
third floor .
hello , kitten .
earl grey ?
jasmine ?
what will you have ?
i' m working .
there .
i' m coming .
do you know where i can find dominique bredoteau ? oh , my poor dear !
you just missed him .
look , there he goes now .
bre to deau .
not bre do teau .
you need a glass of mulled wine .
come in .
come on in .
i' ve lived here for five years .
this is the first time we' ve met .
i never go out on the landing .
i' m fussy about who i meet .
they' re all creeps anyway .
come in .
here .
come in .
they call me the glass man , but my name is raymond dufayel .
amlie poulain .
i' m a waitress at ...
the two windmills .
i know .
and you' ve come back empty handed from your search for bretodeau .
because it' s not " do " , it' s " to " .
like " toto " .
thank you .
i love that painting .
it' s the luncheon of the boating party .
by renoir .
i' ve painted one each year for twenty years .
the hardest part is the looks .
i sometimes feel they deliberately change their mood as soon as my back' s turned .
they look quite happy there .
they should be .
this year they had hare with morels .
and waffles with jam for the children .
now , what have i done with that piece of paper ?
ah , you' ve noticed my video camera at the window .
it' s a gift from my sister in law .
i put it there so i don' t need to wind up my clocks .
after all these years , the only person i still can' t capture is the girl with the glass of water .
she' s in the middle , yet she' s on the outside .
maybe she' s just different from the others .
in what way ?
i don' t know .
when she was little , she can' t have played much with other children .
maybe never .
here .
dominique bretodeau , 27 rue mouffetard .
it' s for you .
every tuesday morning , dominique bretodeau goes to buy a chicken .
he usually roasts it and has it with saut potatoes .
after carving the legs , the breast and the wings , he loves picking the hot carcass with his fingers , starting with the oysters .
but not today .
bretodeau won' t buy a chicken .
he' il go no further than this phone booth here .
in a flash , it all came back to him .
federico bahamontes winning the tour de france in ' 59 .
aunt josette' s slips .
and most of all , that tragic day .
that tragic day when he won all the marbles at break time .
bretodeau !
bretodeau !
the pinch , bretodeau !
do you understand , bretodeau ?
cognac , please .
it' s amazing , what just happened to me .
it must be my guardian angel .
it' s the only explanation .
it was as if the phone booth was calling me .
it rang and rang .
same here .
the microwave' s calling me .
i' il have another cognac .
life' s strange .
to a kid , time always drags .
suddenly you' re 50 .
all that' s left of your childhood fits in a little box , a little rusty box .
have you got kids , miss ?
i have a daughter .
she must be about your age .
we haven' t spoken for years .
i heard she had a child , a boy .
his name is lucas .
i think it' s time i looked them up before i' m in a box myself .
don' t you think ?
amlie suddenly has a strange feeling of complete harmony .
it' s a perfect moment .
soft light , a scent in the air , the quiet murmur of the city .
she breathes deeply .
life seems so simple and clear .
a surge of love , an urge to help mankind suddenly engulfs her .
let me help you .
step down . off we go !
we just passed the drum major' s widow !
she' s worn his coat since the day he died .
careful .
the horse' s head on the butcher' s has lost an ear .
that' s the florist laughing .
he has crinkly eyes .
in the bakery window there are lollipops !
mmm .
smell that .
they' re giving out melon slices .
sugarplum ice cream !
we' re passing the pork butcher .
ham , 79 francs .
spareribs , 45 !
now the cheese shop .
picodons are 12 . 90 , cabecous 23 . 50 .
at the butcher' s a baby' s watching a dog that' s watching the chickens roasting .
now we' re at the newspaper kiosk by the mtro .
i' il leave you here .
bye .
she can' t relate to other people .
she was always a lonely child .
on a sparkling evening in july , while on the beaches holidaymakers relax in the new found sun , and in paris the sweltering crowds gaze at the first bursts of the traditional fireworks , amlie poulain , godmother of outcasts ,
madonna of the unloved , finally succumbs to exhaustion .
in paris' grief stricken streets , a vast throng of mourners
line her funeral route in silence with the measureless sorrow of newly orphaned children .
what a strange destiny for one who gave her all , yet took suchjoy in life' s simple pleasures .
like don quixote , she pitted herself against the grinding windmill of all life' s miseries .
it was a losing battle that claimed her life too soon .
at barely 23 , amlie poulain
let her young , tired body merge with the ebb and flow of universal woe .
as she went , she felt a stab of regret for letting her father die without trying to give his stifled life the breath of air she had given to so many others .
wait !
wait !
wait ...
wait , wait !
pages full of dud id photos torn up and discarded by their owners , carefully reassembled by some oddball .
some family album !
a pack of gauloises .
just a second .
it' s so smoky in here .
can you tell me where they are ?
i can' t see a thing .
more to the left .
there ?
a bit more .
there .
thank you .
you need change .
forget it .
yes ?
a mauresque .
a mauresque for the young man . one kir aligot , one mauresque , and two mint sodas .
was that prenuptial or postcoital smooching ?
is your bullshit congenital ?
prenuptial .
don' t worry .
you' il find mr right one day .
all women want to sleep on a man' s shoulder .
all of them .
all men snore after a few drinks , and i have a musical ear .
i had an operation on my nasal cavities .
i see you' re a born romantic .
i see you' ve never known true love .
i did .
it shortened my leg .
i thought you fell off a horse .
i did .
i was in love with a trapeze artist .
i should have known .
they always drop you at the last minute .
he dropped me just before my act .
it floored me .
and the horse .
with me under it .
the mauresque ?
still , true love does exist .
i' m not saying it doesn' t .
after 30 years behind this bar ,
i' m an expert .
i can even give you the recipe .
take two regulars .
let each think the other fancies them .
leave it to simmer .
it never fails .
excuse me !
excuse me .
i' ve had enough .
i' il go .
haven' t you hurt enough people ?
gina can defend herself .
i don' t mean gina .
i mean georgette .
georgette ? open your eyes !
she craves your attention but you only have eyes for gina .
poor girl !
the things she does to catch your eye !
you really must be blind .
i' m off on a date .
bye !
goodbye .
whoever her new one is , he can' t be worse than that nut with his tape recorder .
joseph' s not so nutty .
he' s just in pain .
come off it , amlie .
they split up two months ago .
to keep on coming here every day , he must be a masochist .
don' t say you haven' t noticed .
noticed what ?
he always sits here , right ?
yes .
sit down .
sit down , georgette .
what can you see ?
my cigarette counter .
and nothing' s missing ?
no .
make an effort .
i don' t get it !
i' il leave you to think about it .
good night .
good morning .
letter arrives 30 years late .
a mailbag found by climbers on a glacier on mont blanc was part of a cargo
iost in a plane crash in the late 1960s .
so sad !
a young , pretty princess for once .
would it be less sad if she were old and ugly ? of course .
look at mother teresa .
is he still chasing gina ?
no , he' s after somebody else now .
anyone i know ?
yes .
funny about this glacier .
somebody at the two windmills ?
not you , surely !
no .
not suzanne .
surely not !
yes .
look .
there he is again .
how strange .
and here .
him again .
gare de lyon .
and here .
march 5th , austerlitz .
always the same blank expression .
twelve times .
i counted .
it' s very odd .
why keep taking your picture all over town only to throw them away ?
good ones , too .
it' s like a sort of ritual .
maybe he' s so terrified of growing old , it' s his only consolation .
he' s dead .
dead ?
yes .
he' s scared of being forgotten .
so he uses the photo booths to remind people what he looks like .
like faxing his portrait from the afterlife .
a dead man who' s scared of being forgotten .
at least these guys here have made it .
they' re long dead , but they' il never be forgotten .
the girl with the glass ...
yes .
maybe she' s distracted because she' s thinking about someone .
somebody in the picture ?
no .
more likely a boy she saw somewhere , and felt an affinity with .
you mean , she' d rather imagine herself relating to someone who' s absent than build relationships with those around her ?
no .
maybe she tries hard to fix other people' s messy lives .
what about her ?
and her own messy life ?
who' il fix that ?
it' s better to help people than a garden gnome .
the driver had 2 . 8g of alcohol in his blood !
makes me sick !
talk about employing irresponsible morons !
mr collignon .
you forgot your keys ...
hold on , amlie mellow .
speed kills .
model yourself on lucien .
no radar will ever catch him while he' s working , will it ?
you shouldn' t do that , mr collignon .
it' s not his fault .
true , mrs cauchoix !
it' s not his fault he can' t sleep .
it' s lady di' s .
guess what i found in the truck .
a lingerie catalogue .
he' d pasted lady di' s face over the model' s .
what today ?
five asparagus , or more local history ?
nothing .
thank you .
the migraine seems to be better .
yes , but my sciatica kept me awake all night .
it' s ages since i saw you looking so good .
really ?
a woman without love withers like a flower without sun .
strange weather today .
what' s so funny ?
everyone who' s come in today has given us a weather report .
we pass the time of day to forget how time passes .
we do it to keep us from talking crap .
i write crap but nobody wants to publish it .
another rejection ?
my thirtieth .
isn' t your cousin a book critic ?
forget it !
critics are like leeches sucking the blood of writers .
is your book a love story ?
no , it' s about a guy who keeps a journal .
not about what' s happened to him , but disasters that might happen in the future .
so he gets depressed and does nothing .
so basically , it' s about a loafer .
suzanne ,
i' il dedicate the manuscript to you .
he' s only doing it so you' il write off his tab !
his scribbles for my nibbles .
that' s sponsorship .
what took you so long ?
look at the time !
somebody peed in his mother !
without you , today' s emotions would be the scurfof yesterday' s .
without you , today' s emotions would be the scurf of yesterday' s .
sorry ?
without you , today' s emotions would be the scurf of yesterday' s .
tickets , please .
how' s work ?
you' ve already asked me that .
yes .
yes .
you' re keeping well ?
pretty much .
i feel a change .
i had two heart attacks and had to have an abortion because i did crack while i was pregnant .
other than that , i' m fine .
good .
good .
is something wrong ?
no , nothing .
your garden gnome' s gone .
is he back in the tool shed ?
moscow .
there .
no explanation .
maybe he just wanted to see the world .
i can' t understand it .
i can' t understand it .
bag ...

any normal girl would call the number straightaway , meet him at a caf to return the album .
then she would know if her dream was viable .
it' s called a reality check , but it' s the last thing amlie wants .

the silicon in her face froze up .
her face was a festering mass !
mulled wine and ginger biscuits .
thank you .
i was too hard the other day on the girl with the glass .
tell me about that boy she saw .
did they meet again ?
no .
they' re into different things .

i almost prayed to st anthony .

nino there ?
no . on wednesdays he works at the funfair .
how long has he had this collection ?
since i got him the job here , last year .
before , he collected footprints .
he worked nights .
in the daytime he took pictures of footprints in wet cement .
he' s a funny guy .
when we met , he was a santa claus .
other things like ...
whenever he heard a funny laugh , he' d tape it .
really ?
must be hard for his girlfriend .
he never keeps them long .
times are hard for dreamers .
eva !

i' d better go .
thanks for the album .
it' s ok .
i' ve got time to take it to the funfair .

is she pretty ?
not bad .
beautiful .
no , pretty .
beautiful .
pretty .
what does she want from you ?
she' s broke .
she wants a reward for the album . or she collects photos , too .
she wants to trade us for a one eyed man with glasses !
no , you dope !
she' s in love .
i don' t even know her .
yes , you do .
since when ?
you' ve always known her .
in your dreams .
hello ?
yes .
you !
man with the plastic bag !
it' s for you .
me ?
yes .
thank you .
hello ?
follow the blue arrows , mr quincampoix .
when the finger' s pointing to the sky , only a fool looks at the finger .
hello ?
i know the stranger in the pictures .
he' s a ghost .
he' s invisible , mr quincampoix .
he only appears when the film is developed .
when a girl has her photo taken , he goes " oooh ! " in her ear , while he gently caresses her neck .
that' s how he got caught , mr quincampoix .
who are you ?
page 51 .
want
to meet me ? ]
listen to this .
a boy of six , while his parents sleep , drives off in a pedal car .
found on a motorway near mnster in germany , he told the police he wanted to see the stars .
isn' t life beautiful , eh ?
love .
the only bug she hadn' t caught !
nobody' s immune .
at least it gives me a break .
love' s a great beautician .
what' s she like ?
tall ?
small ?
blonde ?
dark ?
let' s say ... average height .
not a dwarf or a giraffe .
normal .
pretty , for her type .
as for blonde or dark ... ... it' s hard to say , but she wasn' t a redhead .
unless ...
forget it .
i do remember she casually asked if you had a girlfriend .
and ?
i said you weren' t interested , right ?
you didn' t !
what do you care ?
you don' t even know her .
exactly .
it' s the mystery .
you won' t find mystery here .
a pound of nectarines , please .
these ones here are the prettiest .
trust him .
he' s an artist !
he' s been going home every night with tons of unsold stock .
what for ?
is he stewing a pig ?
no , sir !
he' s studying art !
he sells leeks all day long and paints turnips all night !
the boy' s a useless vegetable .
a good prompter in each cellar window whispering cutting retorts would mean shy people had the last laugh .
at least you' il never be a vegetable .
even artichokes have hearts .
you' il never be a vegetable .
even artichokes have hearts !
memory seven .
darling mado , i miss you more and more each day .
i' m an exile in a world of dreary khaki .
i can' t sleep , can' t eat ...
this camp was the biggest mistake of my life , depriving me of my beloved for five long weeks .
i think of you endlessly .
your adrien .
i turned down my last month' s wages instead of giving notice .
i dream of better times ahead .
an orange coloured day .
remember , my love ?
your ever loving adrien .
good news , darling mado .
soon i' il be able to afford a car and drive home every night .
till then , meet me on friday and we' il go out .
psychiatric helpline .
hello ?
hello ?
one hour later at 11 boulevard st martin ,
amlie walks into a party goods and costume shop .
at the same time , a man leaves his home at 108 rue lecourbe .
26 minutes later , amlie is at the photo booth at the gare de i' est .
simultaneously , the man in red shoes parks outside .
the time is exactly 11 : 40 .
at this precise moment , only amlie has the key to the riddle of the mystery man .
how' s it going , mrs wells ?
it' s always better when it' s not raining .
this is for you .
me ?
dear mrs wells , we recently recovered a mailbag that was lost in a plane crash on october 12th 1969 on mont blanc .
we are forwarding the enclosed letter to your address .
please accept our apologies for the uncustomary delay .
jacques grosjean , customer services .
darling mado , i' m in exile .
i can' t sleep , can' t eat .
i think of you endlessly .
i know i' ve made the biggest mistake of my life .
i turned down that woman' s money .
if all goes well , i' il soon be able to afford a house .
i dream of better times ahead when you' il forgive me andjoin me here one orange coloured day .
your ever loving adrien .
mr dufayel , another package for you .
mr dufayel , do you know what happened to the concierge ?
she got a letter .
from her husband .
40 years late .
that' s a lot , isn' t it , mr dufayel ?
i' m not big on still life , mr dufayel .
then work on your thin layer .
fat over thin .
always !
mr dufayel ...
yes !
the papers said that there' il soon be a new star .
so you' re into stars now ?
i saw it on tv at my mum' s , that' s why .
i don' t know if it' s true .
in america they' re going to take all the rich people' s ashes , put them in a satellite and shoot it into space .
the satellite' s going to shine for ever .
and lady di ...
will they do the same for her ?
lady di , lady di !
give it a rest !
i can' t concentrate .
lady di !
lady di !
renoir .
morning , sir .
cambodia .
i don' t understand .
brilliant !
you couldn' t have done better .
did it work ?
it' s getting there .
ask me again any time .
the harm' s done .
what do you mean ?
everybody calls me snow white !
eva ?
yes ?
could you stand in for me at four ?
again ?
close the door !
what' s up with him ?
is he sulking ?
he thinks i smile too much .
he' d rather you frowned ?
with other men , yes .
nino is late .
amlie can only think of two possible explanations .
firstly , that he didn' t find the photo .
secondly , before he could assemble it , a gang of bank robbers took him hostage .
the cops gave chase .
they got away , but he caused a crash .
when he came to , he' d lost his memory .
an ex con picked him up , mistook him for a fugitive , and shipped him to istanbul .
he met some afghan raiders , who took him to steal some russian warheads .
but their truck hit a mine at the border with tajikistan .
he survived , took to the hills , and became a mujaheddin .
amlie refuses to get upset for a guy who' il eat borscht all his life in a hat like a tea cosy .
what can i get you ?
a coffee , please .
a coffee .
here' s your coffee .
thank you .
he' s understood .
he' s going to put his teaspoon down , dip his finger in the sugar ,
turn around slowly , and speak to me .
excuse me .
is this you ?
yes , it' s you .
i' il take that .
another coffee ?
no , thanks .
i' m fine . ok .
so it' s this man here , the one with with his hand up ?
yes .
is she in love with him ?
yes .
i think it' s time she took a real risk .
she might just do that .
she' s devising a stratagem .
she' s fond of stratagems .
yes .
in fact , she' s cowardly .
that' s why i can' t capture her look .
dufayel' s attempts to meddle are intolerable !
if amlie chooses to live in a dream and remain an introverted young woman , she has an absolute right to mess up her life !
what are you doing , mr dufayel ?
tell me , lucien .
for deliveries , do you keep keys to all the apartments ?
one of your booths is out of order .
it seems to be jammed .
gare de i' est ticket hall .
buy a video , get one free .
no , thanks .
sam ?
samantha ?
samantha ?
can you stand in for me at ...
photo booth , gare de i' est ticket hall , tuesday 5pm .
almost done .
the mystery man wasn' t a ghost or a man scared of ageing , but simply the repairman , a normal guy doing hisjob .
sorry .
he keeps spying on me !
it' s making me sick .
blatant female conspiracy .
gosh , you' re tense , georgette !
good luck .
you' il need it .
excuse me .
did you put this in my pocket ?
yes , but i' m not the one ...
i know .
where is she ?
she' s at her father' s .
it' s awkward .
i' d like to speak to you , but ...
i finish work at six .
can you come back ? ok .
see you later .
docking scheduled .
the blond guy in a camel coat .
he' s very absent minded , too .
how come ?
he came back three times the same afternoon .
camel coat .
camel coat .
camel coat .
stop it !
my rash has come back !
look , suzanne !
my rash is back .
he' s driving me nuts .
lay off !
if she had a clear conscience , she wouldn' t be in such a state .
i' ve had it .
i' m going home .
psychos are the last straw !
georgette !
georg ...
stop smothering them !
women need to breathe .
you let them breathe , they want a change of air .
fresh air' s healthy .
shut it , failure !
failed writer , failed life ...
i love the word " fail " .
failure is human destiny .
it' s gasbag time !
failure teaches us that life is but a draft , a long rehearsal for a show that will never play .
i bet he stole that .
i do have some original ideas , but people always steal them .
a bit like your women .
meaning ?
meaning you' d better get used to it .
speak for yourself , you ...
what ?
what' s going on ?
nothing much .
georgette went out .
joseph got mad .
went out ?
just like gina .
you know who' s she' s with ?
the guy with the plastic bag .
i saw their little game .
the note in the coat pocket , 4 : 08 .
back he comes , and hey presto ! out they go .
i' m worried for amlie because i like you .
what do you mean ?
by and large , the men i like are mentally unsound .
i' d like to know more about you .
ask me questions .
one swallow doesn' t make ... ?
a swallow ?
a summer .
and clothes ... ?
the man .
a good cat deserves ... ?
a rat .
patience ... ?
is a virtue .
rolling stone ... ?
gathers no moss .
it' s a sin ... ?
to steal a pin .
absence makes ... ?
the heart grow fonder .
not bad .
you collect them ?
in my family , we say a man who knows his proverbs can' t be all bad .
pretty girl from the 5th floor , listen to this !
do you believe in miracles ?
not today .
you' re in for a surprise .
what if i told you that a team of climbers on mont blanc had found hard proof that my husband loved me ?
lucien , i need some yeast .
for miss amlie ?
she' s baking her famous plum cake ?
collignon !
go and get the yeast .
amlie ?
amlie ?
amlie ?
go into the bedroom , miss poulain .
so , little amlie , your bones aren' t made of glass .
you can take life' s knocks .
if you let this chance go by , eventually your heart will become as dry and brittle as my skeleton .
so ...
go and get him , for pete' s sake !
international airport .
september 28th 1997 .
it is exactly 11am .
at the funfair , near the ghost train , the marshmallow twister is twisting .
meanwhile , on a bench in villette square ,
flix lerbier learns there are more links in his brain than atoms in the universe .
meanwhile , at the sacr cour , the nuns are practising their backhand .
the temperature is 24oc , humidity 70 % , atmospheric pressure 999 millibars .
