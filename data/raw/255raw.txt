before you' re born ... someone , maybe god , defines exactly how he' s going to fuck your life .
this was my theory .
god only thinks about men at the start ... when he decides whether their life is going to be good or bad .
if he' s in a hurry , he makes a war , or a tornado ... and kills off a whole bunch of people without a thought .
but he did think about me .
' the man of the year '
so , have you chosen ?
this one .
nowadays men are like women .
liposuction , waxing , getting rid of wrinkles , peeling , botox , everything .
for instance , now it' s trendy for men to dye their hair blond .
yesterday , i did two myself .
in my case it was a bet .
i don' t like my clients looking .
spoils the surprise .
what bet was that ?
soccer .
losing is terrible .
who lost ?
me .
oh , my god .
i shouldn' t have left it so long , but ...
i think you' il like it .
hope so .
it' s nearly platinum blonde .
what' s wrong , didn' t you like it ?
i can dye it again , if you want .
i' ve always thought i was ugly .
never enjoyed looking in the mirror .
but on that day it was different .
i looked at that face that was mine but wasn' t mine .
a blond ... a stranger .
i spent my whole life wishing iwere someone else .
and there i felt my time had come .
what are you doing tonight ?
so , what are we going to do ?
i wanted to take cledir to a motel and fuck all night long .
but i' d promise to pass by gonzaga' s bar ... and show my cousin robinson that i' d paid my debt .
i could' ve gone there another time , but i felt like going right then .
i was feeling good ... and wanted to show everyone the new miquel .
where' s robinson ?
what the fuck' s that ?
what' s up ?
what am i , a clown ?
you look funny .
in what way , brother ?
what do you mean ?
just funny .
you look like a gringo .
you telling me i look like a fag ?
you walk in here looking like a gringo and i can' t think it' s funny ?
what' s your problem ?
i' not a faggot and i' m not a clown .
i don' t like you laughing when i walk in here .
that' s the problem .
look , miquel ...
i didn' t call you a fag ...
but i am now .
if you ask me ... any man who dyes his hair blond like that , like you did ... has to be a fag , and big time .
c' mon .
weren' t we going to dance ?
miquel , come and have a beer with us , man .
go fuck yourself .
don' t mess around with that guy .
forget it .
you' re the faggot , suel .
let' s go outside settle this shit like men .
come on , let' s go !
i' m so scared of you .
let' s go !
hey c' mon !
stop that now !
no fighting in my bar !
i' m with my girlfriend tonight .
i' il deal with you another time .
whenever you like , blondie .
let' s go .
tomorrow .
midday , here .
i couldn' t sleep at night thinking about suel .
and my tooth was killing me .
i shouldn' t have done that .
i had gotten myself in a duel .
suel surely had a gun .
i had never held a gun before , damn it .
i was going to stay home quiet , and forget that guy .
fuck him .
i wasn' t gonna go out .
reach for your gun , suel .
fire away , blondie .
that' s how things began .
in this stupid way .
i never thought i' d kill someone .
and all because of a bet .
day of sadness and glory at maracan
i wanted to run away , to leave town but i just stood ... standing there .
i was afraid of suel' s friends , afraid of the cops , of going to jail .
i just wanted to put an end to that agony .
i was going to hand myself in .
hand yourself in , like hell !
like hell !
i told you not to mess with suel !
you' ve got to get away fast .
take that car you' ve been using ... ... and go to the countryside .
no , the maverick' s due tomorrow !
you should go further , up to the northeast .
fuck , marco !
people hide over in niteri .
why don' t you dye your hair black and stay right here ?
after having dropped at the end of last week ... today the dollar increased by 5 . 31 %% against the real ... and was bought at r$ 3 . 165 and sold at r$ 3 . 17 .
the volume of transactions among banks decreased .
hey , miquel !
suel was a fucking thief .
he took boxes of booze ... and said that if i told the cops he' d set fire to the bar .
no one liked him around here .
plus the fucker was under age and couldn' t be arrested .
he deserved to die .
go on , drink your whisky .
i' il just have a coke , no ice .
he' s the one who shot suel .
good work .
helping keep the trash off the streets .
let' s go .
i felt it was still too early for me to feel safe .
but everybody was thanking me , giving me presents .
i never thought that people would be happy with the death of a guy .
they said that criminals belong in the cemetery ... and that i had done society some good .
who farted there , man ?
shit , man .
stinks !
gross , man !
that stinks !
fuck !
just a minute .
trumps .
pass .
so tell us how you knocked that guy out .
the guy came at me like this , right ?
showing off ...
had a girlfriend , didn' t he ?
wonder where she' s gone .
she can go fuck herself .
i ...
i ...
i ...
go on , enoque , spit it out !
it was nobody .
what do you mean , nobody ?
nobody .
mr. baldani sent this .
told me to congratulate you .
congratulations .
bye .
bill clinton' s visit to brazil ... was marked by a breach of protocol .
at the mangueira olympic village ... the american retinue was half an hour late .
they were applauded by the elite of rio' s samba .
the vlps of mangueira samba school heard two celeb' s speeches .
pel succeeded in making bill clinton ... the first us president to join mangueira .
look here !
be quiet !
i can do that too .
don' t eat my sneakers and i won' t eat you .
your name' s bil now .
okay ?
what' s up ?
what' s up ?
who' s bil ?
who' s bil ?
who' s bil ?
who' s bil ...
bil , daddy' s going out now to buy food for you .
food for bil .
after i killed suel a lot of things changed in my life .
that was all the neighborhood talked about .
they were proud of me .
i always thought life sucked , i always did everything wrong ... but now it was different .
i started to enjoy things .
i felt important , happy .
i was going to get a job , work , and date .
in japan there are many ways to prepare fish ... but only a way to cut it .
ginsu 200o for the legend lives on .
sharper than ever , its carbon steel blade ... cuts bones like this .
a genuine ginsu can cut , carve , chop , saw and slice .
its extremely sharp saw toothed edge can easily carve ... this turkey and this shank .
ginsu cuts any kind of vegetable .
look .
how much would you pay for this ginsu 200o ?
don' t answer yet because you' il also receive 6 other knives for barbecue .
their double saw toothed blades can carve any kind of meat .
that' s not all .
you' il also get this cutter ... for delicate cuts of meat that won' t require further sharpening .
bil !
listen to me !
you' re not doing your part !
hi .
hi .
folks are talking about you .
jesus , what happened to your sneaker ?
oh , that was bil .
the dog ?
no , the pig .
pig ?
you' ve got a pig now ?
cool , where is it ?
it' s in the bathroom .
a piglet ... to eat .
what do you think i' d have a pig in the house for ?
oh , don' t eat it .
pigs are so cute .
what is it ?
toothache .
feel better ?
sure .
do you like pork ?
sure , nice piece of loin .
you know , i prefer you like this , blond .
suits you .
you' il have to go back and redo the roots .
i think you' d better go and find a dentist .
dental surgeon
i hate rio .
violence is turning this city into a jungle .
crime is running rings around this place , son .
i' m in favor of the death penalty .
all that talk about human rights is a laugh .
they' re not humans , kidnappers , rapists .
if you ask me , one' s born with criminal impulses .
dr. carvalho was a strange man , but i liked him .
he told me some funny things .
but i was ashamed to open my mouth , my teeth all fucked up .
your teeth are decayed , son , all of them .
how much to pull out the one that' s hurting ?
i can treat your teeth .
you' re too young for dentures .
i don' t think i' ve got enough to pay for treatment .
you' re the one who killed suel , aren' t you ?
you don' t need to pay , son .
i like you .
that is , i like what you did to suel .
that mulatto had it coming to him .
i hate blacks .
i hate mulattos .
i' m one helluva racist .
everyone' s racist .
only the hypocrites have no courage to admit it .
you' ve got a problem .
i' m a dentist and i' ve got a problem .
we can help each other .
you do me a favor and i' il do you a favor .
how about it ?
this is my daughter .
she' s 17 , just a kid .
she was raped .
i never told the police .
you know , the humiliation .
miquel , i want you to kill the bastard who hurt my girl .
i' ve nowhere to stay .
i' il come live at your place .
here ?
suel looked after me ... now you' il have to .
it' s no use throwing me out .
i won' t go .
how old are you ?
fifteen .
if you won' t let me in , i' il stay right here outside your door .
and every time you go out , i' il sneak in .
suel' s mother threw me out .
i' ve got nowhere to go .
you' il have to keep me now .
give me a place to stay , food , clothes ... everything i need .
to get rid of me you' il have to kill me , like you did suel .
i' m not leaving , period .
gee , i' ve already got one pig in there .
it' s nice here .
you can stay here till we find someplace else .
you can sleep on the bed .
i' il take the sofa .
i don' t know about a criminal' s soul ... but an honest man' s soul is a living hell .
just take a look around .
walls with broken glass , iron barbs , barbed wire , bulletproof cars ... bulletproof windows ...
all we ever think about is defending ourselves .
no one respects traffic lights anymore .
no one goes out at night .
no one opens their window at night .
we' re all scared stiff .
well , i fulfilled my promise .
have you brought me any news ?
i know where he works , at a pet store .
he lives with his mother .
she' s really sick ... but he takes good care of her .
everyone' s got a mother , son .
even emperor nero had a mother .
just look at your new smile .
smile , son , show your teeth , laugh .
i' m the one who can no longer smile .
this pain consuming me , my poor baby girl .
i need money to buy a new gun .
why did you kill suel ?
get out !
i' m not looking .
get out and close the door !
why did you kill suel ?
he didn' t do anything to you .
you can stay at my place , eat my food ... wear my clothes , ask for money , play with my pig ... sleep in my bed , just don' t annoy me with that question !
who are you looking for ?
caju .
this is an ar 15 , been very popular here in rio for a long time ... good for pumping lead .
the ammo' s a bitch to find , though .
uzi ... handles easy .
i like this babe a lot .
real nice .
12 pump pistol .
no , i want something lighter , i don' t know , a revolver .
a 38 .
i know what you want .
you want something light ... to carry hidden in your belt , to command a little respect .
right ?
take a 45 , semi automatic .
knocks them right out .
and the ammo' s readily available .
here .
feel it .
feel that power .
feels like you' re wearing a crown , right ?
tell me .
you' re miquel , aren' t you ?
what' s up , man ?
oh , nothing .
in those days , i hadn' t yet learned to hate .
people said ezequiel was evil ... but all i could see was this poor bastard .
hi .
hi .
weren' t you gonna introduce me your friend who' s staying at your place ?
she' s an acquaintance .
i' m going to take a shower .
wait , i' ve got something important to tell you .
what' s that on your shirt ?
nothing .
i cut myself .
he' s angry at me .
but i already told him i' m not leaving .
promise she' s leaving ?
i promise .
haven' t you noticed anything different ?
take a good look .
i' ve put over 6 pounds , can' t you tell ?
guess .
i' m pregnant .
we can marry in march , the baby' il be born in november .
so i can take my vacation from work .
you know the priest i told you about ?
i love father oscar .
at the church our lady of conception ... they do weddings with 15 , 20 couples .
it' s the loveliest thing in the world .
or maybe we should just get married by ourselves .
or everyone will be comparing dresses .
come on , say something !
i thought we could go and live with my mom .
i don' t really like this place .
we can do up that room at the back .
but tell me ... don' t i look pregnant ?
a church wedding ?
yeah .
with a wedding dress , veil , garland , the works ?
how am i meant to know ?
are you mad at me or at yourself about getting married ?
i want to marry .
i like cledir .
i asked her to marry me .
tomorrow i' m going to her place to make the arrangements .
i want to change , want to be a normal man ... have a family , kids , go to church on sundays ...
don' t be ridiculous , miquel !
and where would you get the money to take care of us ?
you have no job .
you know we' re an unauthorized dealer .
you want in ?
fine , but that' s the deal .
no , marco , that' s not my scene now .
i need a proper job .
i' m getting married .
going to have a kid .
why get married right now ?
look , i' ve no job , no money .
make a deal with her .
you don' t know what' s like to have a son .
let' s get rid of the baby together .
i want to get married , work .
if you ask me , only dumb women get pregnant .
and they should pay the price on their own .
let her bring up the brat .
maybe it' s not even yours .
bitches fuck around ...
not bitch , man !
cledir , there' s something i want to talk about .
look how it' s growing , so big now .
it sure has grown .
mom' s coming , she' s getting dressed .
let' s just talk about the wedding , no need to mention i' m pregnant , ok ?
your hands are freezing .
are you nervous ?
cledir , i' ve been thinking ...
i' ve be thinking , and i think it' s for the best ...
ready !
i' m coming !
ah , miquel , i' m so pleased to receive you in my home !
sit down , son .
now i can call you son , right ?
we must register this occasion !
it' s so nice to see you together .
praise the lord !
miquel' s coke !
i' il just fetch it .
no ice , mom .
he likes it without it .
you told me so many times , i forgot .
i wanted to tell you ...
see how happy she is ?
she loves you .
i' ve got to tell you something , cledir .
i know this is a special occasion for you ...
go on !
i think the time' s not right yet ...
cheers !
cheers !
i' m going to recite a poem !
quiet !
life is an open air tunnel .
love ...
oh , i' m no good at poetry .
love .
what about the honeymoon ?
we' re going to araruama .
anyone been there ?
no .
no money ...
humberto !
this is marco , and that' s my cousin robinson .
so you need a job ?
yes .
the guy who used to work with me disappeared .
completely .
do you like animals ?
sure .
animals ?
then the job' s yours .
miquel , come and cut the cake !
cledir was so beautiful that day .
and i realized i wanted to be a normal man .
a working man , married ... with children .
that' s what i wanted , to be a regular guy like everybody else .
i was going to work at the pet shop .
everything would be fine .
lots of shit , right ?
only thing these animals know what to do is shit .
might as well get used to it , you' il have to clean up plenty of baby shit .
baby shit .
take one step and the shit won' t let go of you .
not all marriages are the same .
they are .
only the shit changes .
there' s porous shit , runny shit ...
women are only cute until their wedding day .
after that , they turn into fat , vindictive cows .
they never forgive you for having married them !
do you have any dog biscuits ?
what brand ?
any .
the most expensive .
so this is where you' re working , son ?
do you earn enough to keep your family ?
you did a good , clean job , kid .
brilliant future ahead of you .
dr. carvalho , could we talk outside ?
you went off before i could fully show ... all my gratitude , son .
not many people you can rely on these days .
what' s wrong ?
regrets ?
regret becoming a hero ?
of having rid society of a monster ?
here , this is for you .
see you around .
that guy is a friend of yours ?
he' s my dentist .
what a jerk .
see , zilmar ?
from here i can see all the entrances to the house .
a monitor for each camera .
i know who enters , who leaves .
it' s great .
sometimes i sit here with my whisky .
see , slvio ?
i drink my whisky and sit waiting ... for the day when someone comes .
hang on , carvalho .
you really think that shit might work ?
soares had bulletproof car , bulletproof door ... and look what happened to him .
he got royally fucked .
like i said , a guy puts a gun to your head and what happens ?
you shit yourself .
then you open the door , the safe , the works .
if a criminal wants to get into your house , he will do it .
and he' il take your car , your dollars , your gold , the works !
only one way to deal with it .
look , there' s our guest now .
we' ve got to be realistic .
the cops are incompetent , corrupt .
can' t expect a damn thing from them .
sure , carvalho !
you think i' m expecting something from the cops ?
me ?
remember that crazed nigger in that bus ?
the entire police force against a street kid ?
remember what the kid shouted ?
i' m the devil' s son !
hi .
honey , your father is talking business with his friends .
go back to your room .
go ahead , slvio , speak to the man !
miquel , carvalho told me about how you' ve been helpful ... about your credentials in the community , how reliable you are ... that you' re ready for anything .
just this month i' ve been mugged twice .
by a guy called neno .
the guy is making ... my family' s life hell , and my businesses too .
the police don' t lift a finger ' cause they' re scared of the press ... who are afraid of the ngos .
fucking priests talk about human rights ... protecting 14 , 15 year old pickpockets .
we must defend ourselves .
i want you to kill this criminal for me .
kill him ?
sure , kill him .
how much do you want to get rid of this guy ?
his name is neno .
go on , son , ask away .
slvio will give you as much as you like .
like it ?
i came for bil .
i convinced cledir to let him stay there .
here .
got an old blanket ?
what for ?
for bil .
for the pig ? !
like pigs feel the cold , miquel !
really !
how do you know pigs don' t feel the cold ?
how do you know pigs don' t feel the cold ?
for heaven' s sake !
women are only interested in us to get married and have kids .
then they spend the rest of their life getting on our nerves .
getting fatter and fatter .
i don' t know what' s worse , the ones who put on weight ... or those who work out and stay too thin .
women work out to stay sexy for their lovers .
if you ever find your wife working out in the gym ... beat the shit out of her because she must be cheating on you .
today' s your birthday .
pick a dog as a present .
i' il take this one .
his name is pickpocket .
i' ve given them all names .
pickpocket steals everyone else' s food .
but i think it' s better if i take him later .
bil might not like him .
shall we serve dinner ?
i' m starving .
did you turn off the stove ?
yes .
miquel , they' re not coming .
the baby' s hungry , honey .
come on , right when things are livening up ?
we' re going to ...
easy , easy .
my name is robinson .
this here is my friend enoque .
aunt rosa , you can serve now !
let' s sit down , everyone .
let' s eat .
it' s ready .
been in the oven for 4 hours .
it must be delicious .
what' s this , cledir ?
why ?
where is ...
bil ?
we have a birthday party to go to .
you must be looking for someone else .
bil !
bil !
bil !
how could you do this to me , cledir ?
i was gonna save him for christmas , but , well , it' s your birthday .
you killed bil !
he messed up the house !
only the backyard and i always cleaned it up !
i know who you are , robinson .
i' m looking for your friend .
miquel .
but you' il do .
i' il never forgive you for this !
i' il never forgive you for this !
i meant no harm .
i was only trying to please you .
there ...
robinson' s dead .
we were coming here , neno and the black guy ...
pereba .
robinson knew right away , man .
' easy , enoque , it' s a setup . ' he was right .
' we' re just going to a party . ' deaf ears .
' you' ve had it , i' m loaded . ' bang !
two shots .
they took out robinson !
point blank , right beside me , man .
they sent you a message , miquel .
tell that peroxide fag not to mess with neno .
or i' il blow his brains out , too .
enoque , give me some of that shit .
you sure ?
this stuff isn' t doing anything for me .
nothing .
enoque !
give me that shit .
c' mon .
another .
this shit is useless .
i' m going out .
bastard sons of bitches !
enoque , give me another .
another one .
izilda , where did you put the cigarettes ?
you lost , bro .
all right ?
easy .
remember me , you son of a bitch ?
he can' t see you .
here , look !
what the fuck , man ?
shit , you killed her , enoque !
sorry , i didn' t mean to .
fuck .
slvio had asked me to kill neno .
i refused .
that' d been my mistake .
i had to kill that guy .
either kill , or be killed .
it was better to kill .
every morning i' d give him a banana .
bil was very intelligent .
how do they kill pigs ?
i don' t know .
i hope bil didn' t suffer .
i' m sad about robinson , too .
but bil kept us company , didn' t he ?
no one' s gonna kill you .
i won' t let them .
where have you been all night ?
i told you .
i waited up all night for you !
you could' ve phoned !
you didn' t come home because of that pig .
bil was a pig .
like chicken ... ... they' re there to be eaten .
give me a break , cledir !
don' t talk to me like that .
i roasted the pig because it was your birthday .
i didn' t know you liked it that much .
i do everything for you , and you treat me like a dog .
then he treats you fine !
if you don' t mind !
i' ve got a meeting , humberto .
give me some time , cledir !
time ?
you' ve got time to go off with those sluts !
miquel ? !
kamikaze .
kami means ' wind ' and kaze means ' divine ' .
divine wind .
the hurricane that destroyed the mongol fleet ... which was going to invade japan got that name , kamikaze .
the divine wind saved japan from the mongols .
on war against the americans , the japanese suicides ...
i saw that movie .
kamikazes and japanese got screwed and americans won the war .
miquel , stop giving the kid those almanacs .
and now she wants to learn english .
' how do you do ?
how do you do ?
where is the book ?
the book is on the table . '
what are you learning english for ?
you hardly speak portuguese .
so i don' t speak portuguese ?
ask me something .
ask what ?
i don' t know it myself .
whatever , ask me the synonym of any word .
' symonym ? '
what the fuck' s that ?
i' il tell you .
' dumb ' .
synonym , ' marco ' .
he' s leaving tomorrow .
erica , go and have a coke , go on .
what are you talking about ?
why can' t i hear ?
kamikaze stuff .
go .
shit .
it' il have to be tonight at the funk rave .
funk rave ?
shit , i hate funk raves .

look at the size of that guy' s arm , man !
he couldn' t lift a finger for anyone , son of a bitch .
spends all day at the gym , working out , damn playboy .
taking vitamins .
that' s something fags do .
he' s a real gum fag .
hey , are you a man ?

enoque couldn' t make it .

you can' t do that to someone .
if i want him to eat my shit , he' il eat my shit , okay ?

congratulations .
hygienic work .
hygienic and patriotic .
that' s how you build a decent nation .
where' s the bathroom ?
end of the corridor , son , on your left .
you ?
i was looking for the bathroom .
my father won' t like this one bit .
in fact , he' il think it was on purpose .
he needn' t know , though , right ?
in fact , he needn' t find out about what happened here .
i need to go back to the living room .
you know where the bathroom is ?
i' m not sure i' m going to let you go .
don' t do this to me .
don' t you want to fuck me ?
i' ve got to get back .
it was 10 p . m .
my wife was away ...
i was watching tv in the bedroom when i heard a noise downstairs .
so i went down to see .
found this black guy ... in the living room with a gun .
he was nervous ...
' you can take anything you want .
i' m alone .
take all you want . ' so he told me to sit on the sofa .
i asked whether i could have a whisky and he said he' d have one too .
i gave him one .
he sat down beside me ... told me his nickname was pedro , that his wife was pregnant ... that he hated stealing but he was fucked ... one of those bastards we' ve seen a million times .
get to the point , zilmar , come on .
hello ?
what ?
i' il be right there .
my daughter' s just been born .
let' s have a little whisky .
let' s celebrate , that' s wonderful .
i didn' t die because i managed to drag myself to the gate ... where a neighbor found me , all fucked up , on the sidewalk .
pedro .
kneel down .
i didn' t know , but jesus had scheduled a meeting with me .
i' m going to give myself up to him body and soul , in church .
keep your daughter and your wife .
yes ?

' better the sadness of a smile than the sadness . '
erica , let' s go .
have you met minister marlnio ?
pleasure .
marlnio .
pleasure .
let' s go .
i' m reading the bible with him .
nothing is more important than the words of jesus .
' now i' ve finally come upon you for i' il send my wrath ... '
i need to talk to you .
we can read the bible tomorrow , erica , no problem .
i don' t want anything to do with you .
i was 12 when i saw my father die ... and decided no one would make me suffer again .
you killed suel ... and that didn' t throw me , i didn' t go to the cops .
i asked you to look after me , and you did .
you married and i didn' t kill myself .
you had a daughter ... started getting rich , going around with big shots and leaving me alone .
that hurt , you leaving me alone .
but marlnio taught me that god is always near us .
and whoever has jesus in his heart doesn' t need anyone else .
that stupid fucking preacher' s filling your head with bullshit .
i love you , erica .
prove it .
what do you want me to do ?
cut my arm off ?
cut my left leg off ?
you want me to cut my cock off ?
do you ?
no way you' d do it .
you do nothing for me .
i' il do anything you say , anything at all .
i want cledir to disappear from our lives .
welcome to the lord' s realm .
the door might look narrow , but jesus' s heart is very wide .
it' s so wide and friendly that has room for the saint and the sinner .
inside of it there' s room for me , you , everybody .
those away from jesus are the ones who should fear .
that' s because they walk hand in hand with the devil .
and god sees all .
god knows all .
and punishes everyone most terribly for crimes committed .
think about it , brothers and sisters .
let' s be in peace with our lord and savior jesus christ .
hallelujah .

mr. miquel jorge !
i' m deeply moved by this honor .
it is the duty of all of us to fight ceaselessly so that ... those who wish to live in peace traders , workers ... neighbors , fathers , mothers and families ... may enjoy a most necessary tranquility and safety .
if i ever did anything for you ...

galego , i' il be right over .

poor thing , miquel .
the church needs money .

you said you were earning a shitload of money , for me to ask for anything .
well , i want to give money to the church .
i can' t believe you can' t handle this on your own !
i manage this shit now !
i don' t work the streets anymore .
where are they ?

enoque' s vanished .
marco hasn' t shown up for 2 days .
this job needs more people anyway .
hello .

aren' t you a police chief ?

he knows everything , but won' t open his mouth .
find a way for me to have a word with him , all right ?
marco' s been arrested with 2 pounds of coke .
what the fuck' s going on ?
five minutes , okay ?
someone put the finger on me .
someone wants to fuck me .
who ?
someone who' s jealous .
i' m on top , got a brand new car , dress well .
some people can' t stand seeing a black guy go up in the world .
two pounds of coke ?
it' s all lost , miquel .
find a way to get me out of here .
talk to santana .
the drug squad ... went looking for drugs buried in marco' s yard , and found a body .
i can' t believe you guys fucked up like this .
i can smell shit .
no problem , as long as marco doesn' t talk , it' il be all right .
you don' t understand .
there' s smell of shit .
you must' ve trod in shit .
holy shit , that nigger sure is dumb .
he' s dumb but you' re going to get him out of there .
i can' t do a thing .
i' ve told you a thousand times .
he was nabbed in other jurisdiction .
jurisdiction , what the fuck ?
are you a police chief or not ?
easy , man .
there' s a little matter called the law .
honest cops do exist .
even if i wanted to , i couldn' t release an idiot ... who buried a body in his backyard .
it wasn' t marco .
i know marco .
it wasn' t him .
so who was it ?
whose body is it ?
i dreamed about christ last night .
he rang the bell .
' erica , you and miquel must turn yourselves in to the police . '
jesus always wants people to turn themselves in .
want anything ?
chocolate milk .
don' t you think i look like him ?
take a look .
amazing .
the spitting image .
miquel , there' s something i have to tell you .
i told marlnio that we killed cledir .
it' s faith that extinguishes the fire of hell !
it' s faith that cleanses your soul !
faith that purifies your body !
it is faith that saves us !
please all rise .
let us join hands .
and now , hand in hand ...
i' d like a prayer of faith .
faith ... in our lord jesus .
erica' s not feeling well .
she asked me to fetch you .
priests can' t go around telling what they heard in confession .
i' m not a catholic priest .
i' m a pastor .
erica promised me you' d turn yourselves in to the police .
i gave her two days .
if you confess everything , show repentance for your crimes ... you shall be saved from the fires of hell .
god did not mean us to be hateful and angry .
get out .
if god thinks i should do more , i' il come back and kill you .
what happened to your hand ?
nothing .
i' il call the pharmacist .
don' t bother , gonzaga .
i' d been robbed over 10 times .
i was even shot .
but since i joined sesepa , they left me in peace .
i can even stay open all night , they don' t dare to do a thing .
i' d like to thank you , mr. miquel .
thank you very much .
there' s something i wanted to say to you .
you set curfew in the neighborhood at 10 p . m .
that' s not good , the night schools have to send students home earlier .
i' il lift the curfew tonight .
let everyone know .
what about the park lawn ?
you could free the park lawn ... ... for the kids to play ball .
i forbad kids to play on the lawn ?
yes .
someone said they were damaging the lawn , so you put a stop to it .
no , no .
i said grown ups couldn' t play there .
children can , children up to about 10 , 11 .
you know i like kids .
my name is paulo mendes .
carvalho gave me your number .
i have a company here in nilpolis .
and i' d like to meet you at sesepa .
i' ve got quite a bit of trouble and ...
i need to talk to you about our friend .
meet me at the club at 10 p . m . , okay ?
listen , miquel .
marco was going to squeal .
he was saying that ... he' d drag plenty down with him .
meaning you and me , damn it .
you' ve a glorious future ahead of you .
that traitor of a nigger was going to destroy you !
have you had marco killed , santana ?
what else could i have done , man ?
i can' t believe this .
first robinson , now marco .
you' ve got to get out of this world .
let' s confess everything and escape the fires of hell .
i' ve been in hell for ages .
yes ?
my name' s max .
i' m a police detective .
may i come in ?
this is erica , my sister .
she' s a bit upset .
right , erica ?
with my sister ...
i mean , my wife disappearing .
she ... disappeared , left me .
that' s what i' d like to talk to you about .
have you found cledir ?
i' il do the talking !
how long has your wife been missing ?
a month , more or less .
do you recognize this bracelet ?
it' s my wife' s .
where did you find it ?
it was found on a corpse we found buried ... in the backyard of the drug dealer marcos de sousa , known as marco .
we think it might be your wife .
cledir dead ?
she' s dead ?
you found her body ?
let me see that again .
may i keep it ?
no .
what' s wrong , erica ?
are you scared of that cop ?
no one can prove a thing !
i' m scared of you , miquel .
you' ve changed .
you liked going out with me .
you had fun , used to laugh ...
now everything stinks !
you never sit down , never turn your back , never sleep !
i do everything for you , erica .
i love you .
hear me quick , lord !
i deserved to be punished .
forgive me , lord .
i don' t want to sin no more .
hear my prayer , let my claims get to you .
do not hide your face from me ... on the day of my anguish , lean your ears to me on the day that i call .
i deserved to be punished , forgive me .
i don' t want to sin no more .
you know you' ve fucked up , don' t you ?
so you kill your wife , and bury her ...
i didn' t mean to .
when i pushed cledir , she banged her head ...
it' s no use .
you won' t be able to explain it .
the situation' s fucked up .
we came to offer you a scheme , something good for you .
i' m not going to jail , and i' m not dying .
listen to our plan , damn it !
you' il be arrested anyway .
so it' d better be by santana .
after a while you' il no longer be news .
things cool off , people forget .
remember the guy who killed parents , brother , grandma , the whole family ?
no one remembers him anymore .
before long some guy who rapes young girls will come along ... and take your place in the headlines .
i' il arrange rigged witnesses and put in the report ... that the whole thing was a setup by a criminal friend of yours .
no one will be able to prove a damn thing against you .
and you won' t even stay in jail for long ' cause our lawyer ... is asking the judge to relax your sentence , got it ?
i won' t be arrested , damn it !
miquel , look at me .
it was marco who killed cledir , okay ?
everything' s cool , man .
so you don' t want to be arrested ?
no .
fine .
so you' il have to spend some time at carvalho' s place , in angra .
damn it , angra ?
that' s right .
i' m arranging it with santana .
take some time off , get a tan .
everything will be all right .
that bastard' il be off the hook ... with your arrest .
he' il be a hero and will do you like he did marco .
marco , marco !
he never needed marco !
he needs me .
he earns a fortune through sesepa .
galego , you never liked santana .
they want to help me .
i' m going to angra .
listen ...
sesepa' s dead .
it' il lose all its clients .
that investigator ...
max , he' s not into money .
he' il get you , the dentist ...
santana ...
you' ve got to get out of here , now !
i get tons of letters , people love me .
no one wants me arrested .
anyone important ?
the people who count are those with money .
to them you' re pure poison .
i never want to see you again , jerk .
no way .
the pastor found a place for me , a long way away .
you won' t find me .
i took your daughter .
you never gave a damn about her , anyway .
and i took us$ 20, ooo from the safe .
i' m sorry but i had to .
i hope you go fuck yourself and that your life turns to shit .
till never again .
miquel .
i took your daughter .
you never gave a damn about her , anyway .
i' m pregnant .
never turn your back , never sleep .
i do everything for you , and you treat me like a dog .
robinson' s dead .

each of us chooses his fate .
horse or river .
