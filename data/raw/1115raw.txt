you know who would be perfect to direct this ... and it kills me to say it , because i don' t relish the idea of working with him ...
but ... my ex husband .
val ?
val' s perfect .
he' s perfect , given this material .
she' s right .
this is his kinda story .
look , i love val .
i love him .
but with all due respect ...
he' s a raving , incompetent psychotic .
he' s not incompetent .
they should lock him up and throw away the key .
don' t take that the wrong way .
forget it .
we' re gonna wind up $20 million over budget , and maybe no picture to boot .
that' s right .
i did a picture with him when i was at firestone .
he didn' t even finish the movie .
i was there at firestone .
he had a nervous breakdown .
he was under a lot of stress .
we had just broken up ...
honey , he was fired off a picture here at galaxie just before i took over .
they said his demands were outrageous .
he' s a perfectionist .
the light had to be perfect .
the sun had to be just right .
he demanded that they replace the leading lady .
he wanted to reshoot the dailies every other day .
he fired the cameraman .
finally , he came down with shingles .
they shut down the picture and found another director to finish it ...
you you don' t have to tell me about that .
i was married to him at the time .
you should remember .
that was ten years ago , hal .
his best pictures were ten years ago .
then he became a real artiste .
look , look .
i am the last person to defend that craziness ... because it drove me nuts .
but val cares about movies , and he was born to do this material .
ellie , what are we discussing here ?
shingles , headaches .
why open a can of worms ?
but he' s mellowed .
i' m telling you .
who better to direct this ?
the streets of new york are in his marrow .
ruth .
yes , ruth .
no way !
god !
what about him ?
he' s great .
i know we could get him .
he' d be safe .
we can put our foot on his neck .
martin ruth .
that' s true .
val hasn' t worked in a lot of years .
we could make a good deal .
all you have to do is watch him like a hawk .
we' re gonna lose ...
we' re gonna lose a lot more with val .
i agree with ellie .
i think he' s the ideal director for this project .
but we' re not gonna use him .
who needs trouble ?
right .
besides , what makes you think he' d want to work with us , given all the personal baggage ?
i' m told that he' s in no position to be fussy .
i can' t stand it here .
what the hell am i doing in canada ?
lori , they got moose up here .
moose .
are moose carnivorous ?
my god !
how could you be homesick ?
you got there yesterday .
you' re coming home tomorrow .
val ?
val , val , val .
we' re good to go here .
waiting on you .
did my agent call ?
any word on that tv movie ?
the interracial abortion , gene splicing thing ?
i think the tv movie decided to go with peter bogdanovich .
oh , th th that' s great .
th th that' s just great .
you know , l i love peter . peter' s a beautiful guy .
god bless him .
i , uh ...
val !
val , the client wants more overhead coverage of the spray cans .
one minute .
lori , this is humiliating .
l i' m up here shooting a deodorant commercial .
i got two oscars .
up here , you don' t need oscars .
you need antlers .
here' s a funny script about two kids in a college fraternity ... who invent a machine that can turn women back into virgins again .
it' s very clever .
what' s the matter ?
you know , when you asked me to come out here for you , you promised me ... that i wasn' t just going to be one of those bright women who who finds properties ... and goes to lunch 500 times developing them , and then never gets one made .
honey , the city that never sleeps is green lit .
that' s been your project from day one .
yeah , sure .
until i suggest the director .
and then even though you admit he' d be perfect for it ...
i get shot down .
you didn' t get shot down , honey .
i know that that' s a risky choice , but it' s an inspired choice .
i think you' re trying to help him because you feel guilty .
guilty ?
why should i feel guilty ?
because i fell in love with you ?
i mean , god knows i put enough years in that marriage .
that' s right .
you did absolutely nothing wrong .
i know .
i brought up his name because ... [ sighs ] because he would give you the best movie for that script .
nobody argued that .
he' s probably so angry he won' t even speak to you .
and he' s liable to ruin the picture just to get even with me .
no .
you' re wrong about that .
i' m telling you , you' re wrong .
he would be grateful .
he needs a comeback , and ...
ellie , this is a very , very expensive film .
it' s got solid box office potential .
he can do it .
you don' t regret leaving him , do you ?
you know , one day you look up and you realize that laughs are not enough .
i can handle him , hal .
i just got tired of having to all the time .
and then , you know ... then i met you .
what are you doing home ?
i quit .
no !
val , not again .
you quit over nothing again ?
not over nothing .
what ?
i quit over a big thing .
what ?
they fired me .
that was big enough to quit over .
oh , val !
that' s just great .
i got the last plane out of toronto .
have you ever seen canada ?
now i know why there' s no crime up there .
boy , i must say ... you don' t seem too enthused over seeing me .
well , can you blame me ?
what are you gonna do now ?
you' re gonna sit around the apartment , talking about the good old days .
i gotta get a picture .
boy , somebody' s got to take a chance on me .
this is ridiculous .
when you' re cold , you' re cold .
fortunately , my business manager put away enough money before he went to prison ...
so i could hold out another three weeks , maybe .
your agent called .
hey , you know , if you' d come up there with me , it might have been different .
two people in that sleeping bag is a lot cozier than one .
and who goes on for me in the play ?
for god sakes , it' s an off off broadway play .
you' re in the last stages .
your understudy could have gone on for you .
are you kidding ?
my understudy ?
right , and that will be the one night ... that steven spielberg comes to see the play , or harvey weinstein .
they' re not coming , believe me .
they' re fasting .
i would' ve been so good in that shakespeare movie .
what' s ...
oh !
what' s that ?
these are pelts .
l i traded with a fur trapper between shots ... so the trip wouldn' t be a total loss .
your agent sent over that script .
a script ?
why didn' t you tell me about this ?
the city that never sleeps .
when did this come in ?
well ?
what did you think of it ?
you know , i thought it had definite potential .
it' s got a , you know , really good manhattan feel to it .
you know , they' re interested in you directing .
you know , that' s fine with me .
you know , this is the kind of material that i can really do great .
this is ...
this is ...
you know , i can make this script sing .
this is new york .
it' s nightclubs .
it' s the skyline .
you want some water ?
i' m very excited .
please .
me too .
who wants me ?
well , uh , we have a little selling to do ... but , uh , galaxie is making it .
hal yeager ?
yes , that' s right .
he stole my wife .
ellie is the one who' s pushing for you .
pass .
i' m not gonna work with hal yeager and ellie .
you gotta be kidding .
he' s a philistine and she' s a quisling .
it' s a religious conflict .
will you calm down .
it' s everything you' ve been looking for .
i ...
you know , i' m frankly flabbergasted they would even think of me .
well , they didn' t think of you .
she did .
and she has convinced yeager to come fly to new york and take a meeting with you .
this guy stole my wife .
he doesn' t hold that against you .
it' s business .
can you believe that she would leave me for for hal yeager ?
i still can' t get my mind around it .
mr. slick ...
the price of his haircut could feed a family of five .
calm down .
you' re getting all red .
would you calm down .
and you' re telling me she ... he doesn' t want me ?
she' s the ...
the nerve of them .
he' s such a manicured phony .
may he ...
may he fall on his blow comb ... and get hot in the wrong place .
please , val .
please don' t do anything to kill this .
it' s a golden opportunity .
forget it .
i would rather do the geriatric diaper commercial i turned down .
would you ?
because that' s what the future holds if this falls through .
of course i wouldn' t .
this is a terrific script .
i , you know ...
i ...
make some sense now .
a $60 million dollar , first class feature film .
a big payday , which you need .
and if you score with this one , you' re back on top .
you' il never have a gift like this drop in your lap again .
just take the meeting with yeager .
and ellie ?
yes , and ellie .
i' m telling you , i' il get you half a million dollars .
a lousy half mil they' re offering ?
they want to buy prestige at the shrine auditorium oscar night for a half mil ?
there' s no offer .
it' s not an offer yet .
i reject their offer .
there is nothing to reject .
well , i reject it anyhow .
you better meet with him and you better be nice , or else i' m out of here .
i finally get an offer that' s worthy of my gifts , and look where it comes from .
there is no offer yet .
and i am so tired of all this ...
the big talk about how big you were ten years ago .
things change , and you can' t get work .
you know , part of me wants it so badly .
and the other part ?
also wants it .
that' s the problem .
it only takes one hit .
i know .
and i want a role in this movie .
i don' t have the movie yet .
he' s gotta meet me and throw his weight around first .
and not just a little bit .
something where i can show off what i can do .
lori , i can' t stick my girlfriend in the movie .
i' m not just your girlfriend .
i' m good .
remember all those times i told you you should take acting lessons ?
i' m a natural .
classes would ruin me .
jesus .
you know , ellie feels guilty about dumping me ... so this is her way of clearing her conscience .
great !
what' s the difference how it came about ?
this whole thing is creepy , lori .
for god sakes , this is a woman i was married to for 10 years .
we made love .
i' d hold her head over the toilet bowl when she threw up .
from making love with you ?
not from making love with me .
from eating sushi .
for god' s sakes , i used to hug her when she was afraid of flying .
and and , you know , i kissed her on top of the eiffel tower .
i swam in the moonlight with her at montauk .
now suddenly i got to take a meeting with her ?
i don' t know .
i' ve got very mixed feelings .
this guy has really got to show me he' s changed .
he' s not in a position to make extraordinary demands .
because it was over for him years ago .
he hasn' t touched anything for years ... garbage .
i' m telling you , garbage .
i mean , i' m not saying that as criticism , you know .
the question is , do i wanna let this has been make his comeback picture on my money ?
he' s not a has been .
he' s a very good director ...
who' s fallen on some difficulty times .
he brought it on himself .
he' s his own worst enemy .
look , think of the press angle , you know .
val waxman does his comeback film for galaxie pictures .
what good is the press if the guy ruins the picture ?
he' s not gonna ruin the picture .
no , you' re damn right he' s not because i' il fire him .
i' m not going to take temperamental antics from some " owteur " genius .
auteur . auteur .
whatever .
okay , auteur .
you' re doing a jack story , okay ?
he can do this film better than anybody i can think of .
ha !
we' il see .
you' re so nervous .
you' re making me nervous .
i' m not nervous .
i' m tense .
you are nervous .
i' m tense .
when i' m nervous , i bite my nails .
when i' m tense , i do this with my collar .
just act ...
calm down and act professional .
i am .
i' m fine .
but this is a guy who stole my wife .
years ago , i would never have consented to make a film for him ... and now ... now suddenly i' m auditioning for him ?
it' s crazy .
you know , i would kill for this job ... but the people i want to kill are the people who are offering me the job .
it' s just insanity .
what is that ?
remember in the cab i took a blue pill ?
yeah ?
well , that was to calm my anger .
but it had speed in it .
so then i took another pill after that to calm down the speed .
well , this gets me back up to speed , where i want to be actually for the meeting .
great .
perfect .
yeah .
then that other pill i took keeps me dry when it' s raining out .
ellie .
ellie .
hello , al .
so good to see you .
hello , val .
hello , val .
al .
how are you ?
good to see you .
ed .
i' m so glad you could get here .
are they still having power failures ?
i read that there was a terrible power failure in california .
can i get you some coffee ?
coffee would be wonderful .
electricity .
that the electricity was going off .
come on in .
since when do you wear suits ?
you have any milk ?
you never wore suits .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
uh , cream .
well , val , you look very good .
i' m okay , you know .
i' ve been having some back spasms ... and i have a torn rotator cuff , and and , my knee ...
you know , i got a hearing loss .
it' s the oddest thing .
in my left ear ...
what did you think of the script ?
the script ?
you know , the movie that it' s based on was a stupid little potboiler .
he' s asking about the script .
but the rewrite is good .
thanks to ellie .
she did all the work .
yeah , it' s good .
you know , i think this could make ... a kind of tough , gritty , new york , big city movie .
you can' t make any money just in big cities .
well , i mean , where do you think this is going to play ?
it' s not going to appeal to farmers or shopping malls in biloxi .
oh , i completely disagree .
i think if this picture is mounted properly ... it' s gonna have universal appeal .
where do you think the demographics are ?
the the demographics ?
you mean why the country got so stupid suddenly ?
my theory' s fast foods .
the age group .
the age group of this film .
where do you see it ?
the age ?
this will appeal to , you know ... to , uh ...
adults and teenagers , young adults ... and, you know , kids , adolescents , i think .
toddlers , i imagine .
newborns .
our marketing research shows this film has wide appeal for both sexes .
yes , i agree and then some , actually .
but , the script has some holes in it .
val ...
like what ?
well , take the climax , for instance .
i think the climax comes ... comes too early is the problem .
it should come after the trial scene .
didn' t i say that ?
the inciting event should come later .
the character of benny .
i feel we should shoot benny ... with a hand held camera and not a steadicam .
but it should be nervous .
it should , you know ...
put the audience ill at ease , like his inner personality .
i don' t know if i like that .
it could be with a steadicam .
you even said that .
let me ask you how you' d feel about this , and be honest .
what if we shot the whole picture in black and white ?
why ?
because new york city is a black and white town .
it reeks of black and white .
forget it .
arty .
it' s arty .
does anybody have an aspirin ?
do you have an aspirin ?
here , try one of these .
my herbalist gave them to me .
i can do this picture .
i know ...
i got a feel for it .
i see it all , maybe with like a cole porter score ?
all right .
let us discuss it .
we' re talking to a couple of other directors and , um , we' il let you know .
maybe irving berlin or something .
you bridge the ...
well , i think we' d have to discuss it .
you know , if there ever was a val waxman property , boy , this is it , right ?
we' il keep in touch .
does anyone have a xanax ?
zantac .
i' ve got an ulcer too .
notzantac , xanax .
it' s a completely different problem .
can i talk to you ?
listen , val ...
oh , sorry .
it was great seeing you again .
it was .
you' ve got an herbalist ?
oh , yes .
a genius .
in beverly hills he' s a genius .
if he was in new york , he' d be considered low normal .
you know , we use a completely different rating system here .
when we were kids , there were like ten foreign films a week in this city .
italian , french ...
oh , italian films .
i love them .
val waxman .
any messages ?
you' re sure ?
okay .
did you see my cat ?
isn' t that neat ?
sorry about that .
uh , no .
nothing .
anything ?
we were just talking aboutalfred hitchcock .
mm hmm .
truffaut said notorious was his best film .
i agree .
a masterpiece .
what are you talking about ?
you hate ...
he hates that movie .
the ending makes you crazy .
yes , because it' s a masterpiece .
every time i watch that movie ... when cary grant is carrying ingrid bergman down the staircase ...
i always think that the germans are going to catch them .
i do too .
no matter how many times i see it , i think the germans are gonna get them .
hitchcock was an artist , but he was commercial .
yeah , that' s right .
you say that like it' s a good thing .
you have to be both .
i mean , he knew what he was doing .
in order to make movies ... you have to think about the audience , you have to ...
otherwise , you' re just making movies for yourself , like artistic masturbation .
that' s right .
that' s right .
you' re a narcissist .
i' m a classic narcissist then .
have i told you my views on masturbation ever ?
for me , the nicest thing about masturbation is afterward , the cuddling time .
they' re laughing .
i' m not joking .
want a wienie ?
you got it .
you' re directing the city that never sleeps .
i just got the call .
i can' t believe it .
i ...
i can' t speak .
i got you half a million , plus a tenth of a point after quadruple break even .
listen , uh , they' re going back to l. a. tonight .
you think you could meet ellie for a drink for ten minutes ?
why ?
why ?
because you owe her some thanks , that' s why .
she went out on a limb for you .
i think she wants to make sure you' re both on the same page .
think about hal yeager .
he' s quick to hire , quick to fire .
you need ellie to run interference .
all right .
all right .
i' il meet her at the the ...
bemelmans bar at 9 : 00 .
i can spare ten minutes .
l i can' t tell ya , my head' s swimming .
a tenth of a point after quadruple break even .
you are really a shark , al .
#### [ piano ]
congratulations .
thank you .
can i get a beck' s , please ?
since we' re working together , i thought we should sit down and talk for a few minutes .
that' s fine with me .
i mean , as you know , hal was a little skeptical at first ... but in the end , you know , he' s a businessman and very professional .
let me set your mind at ease .
you don' t have to worry about everything .
things are gonna go very smoothly .
this is ...
this is a big shot for me and i realize that ... you know , many people think that i' m ... that i can be difficult .
but you know i can be very professional ... and obviously , hal yeager' s very professional ... and you' re professional , clearly .
so , you know , as long as business is business , there should be no ...
i cannot understand how you could leave me for that cheesy windbag .
it' s mind numbing to me .
i just don' t understand that .
and you carry on with him behind my back for two months .
it was not two months .
yes .
yes , it was .
don' t tell me it wasn' t .
you were carrying on behind my back ...
not even behind my back , but under my nose .
that' s twice a day .
both places .
okay , you' re exaggerating .
i' m not exaggerating .
you were always on the phone with him .
you were exchanging glances .
i noticed it .
then suddenly , you were exchanging fluids .
l i can' t believe that i didn' t really see it .
you were too self absorbed .
you were too intent on becoming the greatamerican film artist .
don' t tell me that .
everything was fine with you until i started to lose my audience .
then suddenly you dump me and move out to beverly hills with the swimming pool .
you hated california .
we both hated it .
you hated traveling every place by car all the time .
and i hated traveling by mud slide .
well , what did you want me to do ?
our marriage wasn' t going anyplace .
where did you want it to go ?
where do marriages go ?
after awhile they all lay there .
that' s the thing about marriages .
look ...
you know , that' s ridiculous .
no , it was in trouble for a long time .
you see , you don' t see what you don' t want to see .
how was it in trouble ?
we didn' t ...
we didn' t communicate .
we had sex .
yes , we had sex .
but we never talked .
sex is better than talk .
ask anybody in this bar .
you can' t ...
talk is what you suffer through so you can get to sex .
you isolate everything .
you can' t just compartmentalize like that .
a good marriage consists of many parts well integrated .
yes , and is one of those parts adultery ?
never .
absolutely .
at the plaza hotel .
for god sakes , i got the bill .
you had the escargot that afternoon .
i can' t ...
it' s so disgusting .
sex and snails with that roast beef from beverly hills .
you were so busy playing the american artist .
that' s what you were doing , playing .
you felt it was important to be uncompromising and temperamental ... and difficult ...
god , difficult !
to starve and to suffer .
i tell you , you had all the symptoms , not the disease .
you used to think i was creative and original .
and i still do ... as a filmmaker .
it' s when you became creative as a hypochondriac , that was it .
hey , all those attacks were for real .
oh , yeah ?
yes .
the black plague , val ?
an allergy to oxygen ?
elm blight ?
only trees get elm blight ...
elm trees .
can i sum it up ?
you cheated on me .
you lied .
you dumped me ...
business .
we' re here to discuss business .
that' s right .
can we discuss it ?
i wanna keep this absolutely on a professional level .
absolutely .
i think that we should rework the script a little bit ... because i think it doesn' t have to be middle aged people .
we could make the character of kelly swain , you know , maybe coming out of college .
that' s true .
you mean out of law school ?
law school , yeah .
i think they' d like that at galaxie .
that way we could cast somebody like terry tyler ...
great . or maybe find ... there' s a lot of talented kids out there .
you are such a shallow jerk !
i can' t get my mind around it .
that you would leave me for a guy who is the opposite of everything i am .
you know , with his ski lodge in aspen and his collection of vintage cars .
if i drove around in a 1939 mercedes , people would think i was himmler .
hal' s very smart , and he' s a brilliant deal maker .
yes , i know .
he' s been audited by the best .
he has made some pretty financially successful american films .
that should tell you all you need to know about him .
he' s the white line down the middle of the road .
you had your little flirtations too .
there was that that italian model .
no .
you were the only one that i was serious with .
my god .
until you suddenly became noncommunicative , nonresponsive and you dumped me ...
the movie is going to be a fun movie to do , i think .
um , and i have a lot of ideas that i think we should discuss .
good .
absolutely .
i just wanted to assure you that once the studio agreed to you ... you' il have their full support and ...
well , thank you very much .
i want a ...
i think i want a foreign cameraman .
that' s no problem .
because they get a texture into the work ... that you would never get with an american cameraman .
they have a certain mobility .
i remember coming home and i picked up the extension ... and there you are on the other end of the extension with this guy .
i' m calling and i hear my wife in a lovey dovey with her lover , saying she misses her lover .
he wasn' t my lover yet .
bull !
he was your lover .
what are you telling me ?
and i recognize the voice .
it' s hal yeager from galaxie pictures .
and i' m thinking to myself , " why is my wife talking like that to hal yeager for ?
they' re making me a surprise party .
i thought they were making me a surprise party .
were they ?
no .
she was having an affair with hal yeager .
follow the story .
jesus , i can' t believe this ...
i' m getting out of here .
wait a minute .
where are you going ?
we' re discussing a movie .
no , i' m sorry .
i just ...
what about ...
i' il be back and forth from l. a. and i won' t bother you ... and i' il see to it that nobody gets in your way creatively .
what about denise daniels as the blackmailer ?
possibly .
if you like .
i think she would be great .
you know what i mean ?
or sarah bedloe .
she would be very interesting .
she ...
i pick up the phone and she' s talking ...
i' m going to order a corn beef sandwich , she' s talking to her lover on the phone .
look , i' il be back from l. a. in two weeks ...
this is gonna be a fun picture .
it' il be great .
we' re all very excited .
i' m looking forward to it .
about hal yeager .
the word on him is cross dresser .
check it out for me .
i pick the phone up and she ...
hal , we' re off to a really good start here .
tell me about it , honey .
val wants to use a foreign cameraman , which i think we should give him .
he' s got a real visual concept of where he wants to go with this thing .
um , now he' s chosen kow chan , a chinese cameraman ... done some stunning work , mostly with the red army .
he says he doesn' t like his hotel .
he much prefer the sherry .
hal , listen .
val wants to go with elio sebastian as art director .
val says that elio really knows the streets of new york .
every location in the script is out there waiting to be found .
this is great .
it saves us a fortune .
times square and harlem .
i have to build times square and harlem .
we can' t build times square and harlem .
with all due respect .
he wants to build the empire state building ?
no .
just the first 20 stories .
absolutely not .
no , sweetheart .
it' s not gonna happen , okay ?
just tell him no .
it' s not gonna happen .
all right , i' il handle it .
good .
great .
hey , listen .
i miss you .
how' s the weather back there ?
it' s been great , you know ?
it' s been really new york moody .
very gray and cloudy .
that' s the way it is .
today' s the first day of sun we' ve had in awhile .
well , listen , here it' s been fabulous .
sunny and clear every day .
oh , listen .
i gotta run .
i' m having another skin cancer removed .
this is perfect .
this view is absolutely perfect .
no , no .
i hate it .
i' m ... we' re just gonna have to build it .
build central park ?
yeah .
you know , i take back what i said before about ...
mixing real locations and sets ...
i don' t wanna be a money watchdog here ... but if you did build everything ...
i say this metaphorically ... it' d have to be done over my dead body ... metaphorically .
all right , if not the whole park , then just the reservoir .
build the reservoir ?
uh huh .
you know what ?
you get a studio ...
put a tank in it and fill it with a couple thousand gallons of water ...
it' il work .
and then ...
wait ... trees behind it , you know ?
new york as a symphony in green .
green i hate .
i never use green .
no .
no green .
you know what ?
tell mother nature , okay ?
trees are green .
we can play it for the winter .
you can use snow .
i buy that .
a white background to set off the two leads ... and marvelous ' 40s red .
what ?
what ?
what is he saying ?
what ?
he says no white .
no white .
he cannot shoot white background .
sebastian , what have you gotten me into here ?
you know what ?
i prefer green myself .
green and red .
all i' m saying is that i think you' re being precipitous in firing him .
look , i never wanted this guy .
not from day one .
hal ...
i beg your entire pardon .
may i just offer for your consideration ...
a single concept , and i say this ...
you don' t have to ...
stand up , you don' t have to lean into the speaker .
look , he' s out .
i want this guy out before this picture becomes a cost nightmare .
look , hal , i think that maybe if we had a talk with him .
i said from the start to use harold pappas .
pappas is a hack .
pappas is safe , but he' s uninspired .
i can' t work with him .
then you should bow out now .
i said i can' t work with him .
i didn' t say i wouldn' t .
val , i don' t mean to get hot under the collar , but pappas has how many nominations ... compared to this greenwich village lunatic ?
they probably spent more money getting those nominations ...
than he' il spend building a reservoir .
i didn' t get that .
nothing .
nothing , hal .
i gave in on the chinese cameraman .
i' ve kept away from your picture .
i' m saying i' d feel more secure with pappas .
a word to the wise .
is there anything about the part of benny ... that you want to tell me before i read it ?
only that he' s a broadway sharpie , a gambler .
like sky masterson ?
perfect .
exactly .
now , forgive me , it might seem obvious , but he' s a runyonesque ... bookmaker type , uh , is tough , but softhearted with his wife who he' s nuts about ?
that' s it on the nose .
that would be perfect .
go .
jerry , some guys were over the house looking for you .
seems you owe some money .
i hope you didn' t tell them anything , helen .
i could find myself in deep trouble .
deep , deep trouble .
thank you .
hi .
i' il wait for you .
if they give you 30 years , i' il be waiting .
if they give you 50 years , i' il be waiting .
if you get two consecutive life sentences ...
i' il be waiting .
i thought that last girl was kind of interesting .
did you ?
really ?
i thought she read it better than the others .
i know , but claire' s supposed to be classy .
didn' t you think she was a little on the cheap side ?
cheap ?
to be perfectly honest , i thought she radiated stupidity .
stupidity ?
i mean , her reading was competent enough ... but , my god , it' s like her persona ... it' s trashy and dumb .
well , you know , i think i' d like to use her .
she was interesting .
you' re the director .
it' s not that big a part , ellie .
but it' s a featured role .
claire' s supposed to be a socialite , for god sakes .
this girl , " lori fox , " she' s like a step above trailer park .
well , i would hardly call her trailer park .
i said a step above .
well , i' d like to use her .
i thought she was perfect for the role .
fine .
i mean , it' s your decision .
i' m just throwing out ideas .
you can take ' em or leave ' em .
two for yeager , please .
they' re clearing your table , mr. yeager .
thank you .
i am so glad that you could come in .
i really am .
i was here on business and i wanted an excuse to see you .
i didn' t want you to think i was crowding you .
i know you , you know .
you' re checking up on me .
everything' s going really fine .
it is .
and val ?
val' s val .
he seems reasonably flexible .
most of his ideas are really good .
you' il see .
i hope so .
right this way .
thank you .
there are no personal feelings that make it seem awkward ?
no , no .
i think he' s accepted things and moved on .
good .
by the way ...
andrea ford' s going to be covering the making of the film for esquire .
oh , no kid ...
hey , val .
we were just talking about you .
hey , val .
ellie was telling me how well things are going .
how are you ?
good to see you .
everything all right ?
what are you doing here ?
what do you mean , " what am i doing ...
no , what are you doing here at this moment ?
we used to eat here .
hal came in on a plane a few hours ago .
that' s the best way to fly .
what are you doing in this restaurant at this moment ?
what do you mean ?
we' re coming in to get a bite ...
are you all right ?
you' re awfully fidgety or something .
what are you doing ?
are you okay ?
yes , no , i' m fine .
i was just thinking you should go to your table because it' s crowded here .
i' m ready to go .
it' s the woman that was at the audition today .
that' s very funny .
hello , miss .
aren' t you going to introduce me ?
it' s lori fox , isn' t it ?
yes , of course .
i think it was .
yes .
val is such a riot .
stop kidding around .
i just ...
i really wanted to put your mind at ease ... that just because i' m the director' s significant other , i can still act .
hi .
hal ?
hey , mort .
how are you ?
i thought you were in aspen .
i wish .
you know ellie , my fiance ?
hi .
how are you ?
hi .
i' m lori fox .
nice to meet you .
f f fiance ?
congratulations .
when' s the date ?
new year' s eve .
my goodness , how romantic .
that' s wonderful .
congratulations on your new film .
you know val waxman .
of course .
sure .
we sued him ...
fiance ? for failure to complete a picture .
that makes me feel secure .
i' il see you tomorrow , val .
hurry !
i' il miss my flight .
this is not a good time for you to go away .
i' m very vulnerable .
if i' m gonna be in this movie , i have to get into shape .
this spa is the only way i' il ever have the discipline .
but you' re not overweight .
oh , my god !
i' m a horse .
i have to appear in lingerie .
what if we need you ?
it' s a ten week shooting schedule .
my scene doesn' t come until the very end .
what if i need you ?
i' m going through a bad time .
you' il be fine .
you' il be fine .
you' re a big boy .
oh , geez .
you know , i' m afraid to sleep alone .
l l i keep thinking people are breaking in .
i lay awake all night ... thinking of death and the blackness and the abyss .
oh , oh , don' t forget to water my cactus .
call me every day .
i can' t .
they don' t have any phones at dolby ranch .
they want to discourage secret eating schemes .
oh !
oh !
oh , my gosh .
oh , my gosh .
okay , i gotta go .
gotta go !
and we want to see the earrings .
profile .
other profile , please .
and cut .
thank you .
is it true your cameraman speaks only chinese ?
yes , mandarin .
it' s so hard to find a good cantonese cameraman these days .
neighborhoods just don' t have them anymore .
hal yeager' s known to be very hands on , very hot tempered ... quick to replace people .
does that bother you ?
no , because the deal is ... they' re going to leave me alone during the shooting .
i have complete freedom .
how about working so closely with your ex wife ?
well , it' s not so close .
she' iljust be up and back .
it' s not going to be that close .
well , there must be some bitterness .
especially now that she' s going to marry hal yeager , the man she left you for ... who' s now your boss ?
who are you ?
oh , i' m andrea ford .
i' m going to be doing the story ... on the making of the movie for esquire .
oh , really .
are you ?
yeah .
yeah .
didn' t they tell you ?
i' m going to be observing the whole time .
' cause i don' t usually like , you know , when journalists hang around the set ...
and observe when i work .
take that up with the press department .
but don' t worry .
i won' t get in your way .
i promise .
i am a huge fan .
yes ?
oh , huge .
i have loved all of your movies .
oh , well , you know ...
and you' il be hanging around doing a story here ?
yes .
because , in fact , i' ve always thought of you as a unique american artist .
oh .
well , i' m sure you won' t be in the way here .
you know , there' s plenty of room and you can have ...
val .
hey , gosh , i' m so sorry .
can i steal him for a minute ?
i really was about to ...
some things we have to go over .
i' il get him right back to you .
i' m so sorry .
in one minute .
i' m so sorry .
you need to be careful .
she is a killer .
she' s a killer ?
i didn' t think it was a good idea having her around all the time .
but then the press department told hal that they could get the cover of esquire and so ...
how is she a killer ?
she loves me .
well , that' s fine .
i mean , if she likes you , you know .
otherwise , she can be biting .
really ?
i hear she' s all sugar and sweetness ... and gets into your good graces and then wham !
she kept telling sean madigan how she loved all of his films and she was a big fan .
how he was a great , i don' t know , unique american artist .
really ?
and then in the profile , she disemboweled him .
you know , if you happen to fall for that kind of flattery ...
i can handle it , though .
please .
you couldn' t handle shirley temple .
give me a break , will ya ?
you know , i can' t figure it out .
it' s okay to have an affair with hal yeager , but ... you know , everyone is entitled to have one psychotic episode in their lives , but ...
to marry the guy is ...
honestly , i wouldn' t talk if i were you .
what does that mean ?
i don' t know .
how long have you been living with that wind up doll i met ?
you know i don' t like to sleep alone .
for god' s sakes , i' m not going to marry her .
and that wind up doll happens to have a ph . d.
in what ?
history of gym ?
hey , look .
will you give me a break with the cutting remarks ?
i got a picture to do tuesday .
i' m thinking about my work .
i want you to get some rest this weekend , okay ?
and don' t lie around the whole time worrying about everything that could go wrong .
don' t worry .
i' m not going to lie around .
i' ve got my hand on the wheel , honey .
this picture' s in the bank .
amanda , honey , who is it ?
i don' t know .
uncle al , it' s for you .
please , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
a man or woman ?
hello ?
al , you gotta get over here right away .
why ?
what' s wrong ?
i' m at my sister' s for a seder .
al , you gotta get over here .
this is a matter of life and death !
it' s open .
come in !
what is it ?
what' s going on ?
what am i doing here ?
al , i going to try to explain this to you .
i came home , and i started to make notes on the script , you know ... because we shoot tuesday and i wanted , you know ... then i started to get nervous .
so , i sat down on the sofa , and i was doing my deep breathing exercises ... just to stay calm , you know ?
and it was working , and i started to relax , and i dozed off .
then i slept for a while .
then i woke up , al ... and ...
i can' t see anything .
what ?
i' m blind .
i' m blind , al .
what ?
i' m blind .
i' m blind .
i can' t see .
what do you mean , you can' t see ?
what do i mean ?
those guys in the street with the dark glasses and accordions ?
what are you talking about ?
are you trying ?
al , you can' t try and see .
you look around and you see or you don' t see .
i don' t see .
how can you be blind ?
howthe hell do i know how i can be blind ?
i' m ...
al , i' m scared .
what did you eat ?
what' s the difference what i ate ?
you you you can' t lose your vision from a plate of tofu .
l i never heard of anything like this .
yes .
i did .
remember the actor harvey gates ?
yeah ?
he lost his vision suddenly .
from what ?
grapefruit .
grapefruit ?
yes , he had a tumor the size of a grapefruit on his brain .
and he went blind ?
yes , he went blind ... and and a few months later he went dead ... which is worse than blind ' cause your options decrease .
relax .
you don' t have a brain tumor .
al , with all due respect ...
i have to hear that from somebody who went to a greater medical school ... than the william morris agency .
we' il get you to dr. mason .
you still use mason , right ?
no .
mason dropped dead on the treadmill .
i use koch .
you know , i use koch too .
did you bump into anything ?
did you fall ?
did you bump your head or something ?
i didn' t bump my head .
nothing !
al , i got a brain tumor .
that' s the story here .
l i ...
the end is in sight .
i see the wall .
i thought you said you couldn' t see .
it' s an expression .
i don' t actually mean i see a wall .
it' s in my mind' s eye .
listen .
i remember that ellie and i took you to the hospital ...
you insisted on taking you to the hospital because you were convinced ...
you had hoof and mouth disease .
oh , god .
ellie !
look , if i die , al , tell ellie i' m sorry i said all those things to her .
i said terrible things to her .
i called her all kinds of names .
probably because i never stopped loving her .
you' re not dying .
well , if i don' t die , tell her she' s a tramp and she' s living with a guy ... the best you could say about him is sometimes he returns phone calls .
oh , dr. koch .
it' s al hack here .
i' m sorry to call you at home on holiday , but i' m sitting here with val waxman ...
okay , you can sit back now .
so so , what is the story ?
well , your optic nerve is normal .
your eye exam is normal .
i don' t see anything .
wonderful .
you don' t see anything ?
i don' t see anything either .
that' s the problem .
any tumor large enough to impact on his vision so dramatically would show up .
i only wish i was in as good health as he is .
this is a textbook scenario . physically , you' re 100 percent .
but just like someone who has an hysterical paralysis ... a patient who' s fine but he can' t walk ... or a patient who loses his or her voice ... from witnessing a horrible shock or any extreme , stress related trauma ...
being a film director , your inner conflicts ... have chosen to express themselves in this very telling fashion .
you' re psychosomatically blind .
how can i get rid of it ?
by treatment .
by understanding the roots of your conflict ...
there' s every chance that this blindness will go away .
how quickly ?
well , real growth is always very slow .
there goes my comeback .
you cannot breathe a word of this to anybody .
i gotta tell ' em , al .
you know , i just dread telling ellie .
are you nuts ?
they' il fire you .
fire me ?
i obviously can' t direct the picture .
what are you talking about ?
how can you blow this shot ?
what are you talking about ?
i' m blind .
nobody knows .
what the hell does that mean ?
what are you suggesting ?
if you pull out of this project now because psychological stress ... has caused you to lose your sight , you' il never work again .
they' il burn your union card .
maybe they could postpone it .
oh , yeah , because you' re blind ?
val , direct this picture and bring in a hit ... or i leave you with two words : homeless man .
i can' t direct ...
how can i ...
i' m telling you how .
you' re going to muddle your way through until your sight returns .
al , i can' t direct a picture .
i' m blind .
have you seen some of the pictures out there ?
the first five minutes they' il catch me .
maybe they will , maybe they won' t .
if they do , you' re no worse off than if you confess ... because you' re finished in the business anyway .
you gotta be joking .
i' il take one step on the set , i' il break my neck .
no , no , no .
i' il come with you .
they won' t let you .
the actors get nervous when agents hang around .
it' s against galaxie policy .
listen .
once you get on the set , you get relaxed , you won' t even need me .
there' s no way to do this .
i would have to take somebody into my confidence .
absolutely not .
no .
never .
not a hint .
this can' t get out .
you will direct a hit picture .
sometimes god works in strange ways .
like job .
notes on " making of the city that never sleeps .
first morning atmosphere is upbeat .
lots of eager anticipation .
people moving lights .
actors and actresses all ready in costume and makeup .
val waxman is not the first one on the set .
actually , a few minutes late .
this is never going to work .
it' s working perfect .
just stand straight .
am i going to bump into anything ?
no , no , no .
i' il guide you .
you don' t trust me .
you have to trust me .
i gotta look funny .
you look perfect .
i' m telling you .
l l i ...

coffee .

coffee .
yeah .

no .
i' m ...
no thank you .
okay .
well , the actors are here if you' re ready to block the scene .
blo blo block the scene ?
yes .
we could ...
listen , val .
are you okay with the changes in the set ?
oh , the set .
it' s beautiful .
oh .
it' s great .
how do you feel about the background color ?
you satisfied ?
it' s blue and , you know , brown and yellow , but is it a little dark ?
beg your pardon , who are you ?
i' m al hack .
al , can i speak to you a second ?
yeah , uh , i' il be right back .
don' t worry .
i' il be right back .
al ?
yes , yes , yes ?
not that you' re not welcome here .
you know i love you .
yes , yes .
but , you know , this is a closed set .
oh , well , you see , he really needs me .
he likes me to be with him .
i know , but a man of your stature ... an agent ...
you know , it intimidates people .
oh ...
you look so good .
have you had any work done ?
just over here .
a little ?
' cause i ...
who did you go to ?
not that i need it ...
fred .
fred . but i' m thinking about it .
oh , he' s incredible .
you got the best clients .
can you get me a price ?
i think that we may be like a little bit too light .
would you prefer that i take the whole thing one shade darker ?
eh , well , that' s a ... that' s a possibility .
what do you think ?
what would you do ?
well , i really don' t know .
it' s possible i could make the whole thing match the upholstery .
that' s another option .
that' s brilliant .
that' s what i would do .
i would match the upholstery .
excuse me .
chief , what alarm clock would you like to go with ?
uh , that one .
that one .
that one .
which one ?
i' m sorry ...
i' m sorry .
which  yes .
yes .
yes .
you like the wind up or the electric ?
yes .
the wind up .
wind up .
i like the wind up .
val ?
val ?
excuse me .
excuse me , gentlemen .
can i see you just for a second ?
don' t worry .
excuse me .
al , this is not working .
don' t worry .
don' t worry .
it' s going to work fine .
but you' re right .
it is a closed set , and i have to leave .
you ...
listen to me .
listen to me .
just go to plan " b.
what is plan " b " ?
we don' t have a plan " b.
we gotta find somebody ... who you trust who will help you .
someone you can rely on .
you mean , tell someone the truth ?
yes .
somebody you can rely on .
we' il get somebody who' s around you all the time .
who doesn' t look odd , you know ?
maybe the a. d. ?
what about the script girl ?
i can' t do that .
they' il get in trouble .
if they get caught ... they' il never work in the business again .
l i have a responsibility , al , to ellie and even to hal .
you have a responsibility to yourself !
you have agent' s ethics .
i can' t go by you .
don' t hit me with oxymorons at this time .
we' re in a crisis !
wait a minute .
shh .
what about the chinese kid ?
the translator ?
yes , the translator .
the translator .
he' s a business student at nyu , right ?
he doesn' t care if he' s in the movie business .
if he gets caught , it' s no big penalty .
well , he is always around me .
it' s a natural natural ...
yes , see ?
val , i' ve got the actors .
we are ready for you .
don' t worry .
don' t worry .
i' il get you to the set .
take it easy .
take it easy .
i' il take you .
i' il take you .
it' s gonna be fine .
if lf i' m acting so crazy , everyone' il notice that i' m acting crazy .
listen .
you got a reputation for being crazy .
this is the perfect time for it to work in your favor .
watch out .
one step .
one step .
ah , very good .
hey , can i have mr. waxman' s chair here ?
the director needs his chair .
where is it ?
chair ?
thank you very much .
here , come sit .
look , your lucky chair .
oh .
isn' t that wonderful ?
sit , sit , sit .
be relaxed .
real good .
good luck .
i can' t work with outside people watching me .
nobody' s gonna be watching .
incidentally , you like this one or this one ?
i like that one .
this one ?
' cause this one' s more like ...
yes , that one . what they' d really use , but this one' s more theatrical .
well , you know , you can use this one if you' d like .
but i prefer that one .
which one ?
the first or the second ?
this one .
i' d like to make my entrance from the stairs .
hold it .
what ...
who ordered ?
who ordered ?
what' s happening ?
how do you want me to kiss her ?
what' s happening here ?
which way did you want me to kiss her ?
you know , on the ... on the mouth .
what about my mouth ?
no , kiss her on the mouth .
he hasn' t seen here for six years .
we originally discussed some kind of passionate way of grabbing her .
oh , well , use both lips .
oh , excuse me .
could i talk to you just for a second ?
me ?
yeah , just for a minute .
uh , they need me .
well , actually , the director ...
the director asked me to talk to you .
yes .
mr. waxman ?
it' s a chance to make some extra salary .
now , you seem to be a very responsible young man .
are you ?
you should move left .
you got me doing two things at once here .
i can' t work if i don' t know what you want .
you should cross left .
wait .
me ?
you mean my left ?
if i cross my left , i' m going to bump right into him .
you don' t have to bump me .
i' m probably going to knock him over .
where is the translator ?
excuse me .
he' s supposed to be on set .
sir , i have a very important message for you .
important message for me ?
um , i' m here to help you .
i know about your secret .
don' t !
cut !
very good .
that was terrific .
was it very good ?
was it very good ?
well , i don' t see the dramatic impact of it .
but it did seem a little improvement from the random chaos ...
you were encouraging .
oh , thank you .
you didn' t like the random chaos , huh ?
let' s ...
can we go again ?
just for safety , one more ?
okay , sir , we' re approaching a hallway right now .
so we' re gonna walk slowly .
there' s nobody here .
practically nobody .
okay .
be careful .
i' m trying to be casual , but it' s extremely difficult .
oh , i know that ...
ooh !
sorry .
boss , you all right ?
yes .
no , i' m fine .
it was my fault completely .
i forgive you .
sir , he' s gone .
he' s not there anymore .
you' re talking to air .
why didn' t you warn me ?
i thought you saw him .
this is very weird for me .
you thought i saw him ?
how am i ...
a few summers ago i did aid a deaf uncle .
you' re going too fast .
okay , slowly , slowly .
it' s very weird .
i was helping out a deaf uncle a few summers ago ... but we didn' t have to hide it like this .
oh, jesus , this is great .
val , you wanna go with this one tomorrow or the big one ?
uh , well ...
wow .
these are beautiful pocket watches .
thanks .
i would go with the big one .
val , um , how' d you feel the first day went ?
the first day was , you know , like the first day .
it was like a shakedown where you weed out the malcontents .
oh , good .
i' d love to speak to you for a few minutes if you' re not too busy and all .
l i ...
well , sir , uh ... you said you wanted me to show me that , uh , piece of jade ?
jade ?
you know what ?
if you have work to do ... we' il do this some other time .
yes , i do . l i ...
okay .
thank you .
sorry , sir .
that' s all i could think of to extricate you .
you realize there' s no piece of jade .
yes , i get it .
i get it .
there' s no jade .
hey , everything okay ?
so far our conspiracy has gone undetected .
perfect .
i' m taking you to your shrink right now .
listen .
same drill tomorrow , chou .
don' t worry .
i' il practice casual banter .
very good .
good .
nice to see you .
to observe val waxman directing ... one would think he has no idea what he' s doing .
i wonder if he is one of those cinema geniuses ... who thrive on chaos , like fellini .
he always seems distracted .
he never looks anyone in the eye ... and must be juggling a million things in his mind at once .
it' s easy to see why his reputation is one of an eccentric .
i notice , too , as the weeks go by ... what a great interest he has in the photography ...
