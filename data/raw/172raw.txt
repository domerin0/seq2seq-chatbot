i hope no one sees us .
lf we get caught .
nobody is gonna get caught .
so they just let you tip ' em over ?
they' re gotta be sleeping , so shush .

you ruined the element of surprise .
eike they weren' t going to wake up anyway .
yo , come here .

i think they' re a little scared .

we just lucked out .
you two are so shakin ' them asses .
that ' s right .
no , that doesn' t count .
the deal was to tip the bull .
and the bull has been tipped .
but look at it .
no baby , don' t touch it .
what is it ?
what is that ?
eet ' s get the hell out of here .
eet ' s go .
come on , johnny .
eet ' s go .
eet ' s go .
come on !
mr. eong ?
mr. eong .
what do you want ?
you got business here ?
you called me , about a sick cow ?
where' s the company vet old felix ?
i believe he retired .
well , got this one here .
and another one in the barn .
only she ain' t dead , just mighty sick .
was this one sick ?
she didn' t show it if she was .
any idea what might have taken down a14oo pound animal like this ?
ain' t been nothin ' in these parts for a long time .
to take down a girl like this .
i' m gonna take a look at the sick one .
easy girl .
easy .
id never had trouble with this one until about two months ago .
all of the sudden she started putting on weight .
and now this .
they ain' t hook worms or round worms .
i know that .
could be liver fluke cysts .
i don' t think so .
even ol ' felix could have told me that right off .
i' m sure it ' s nothing to worry about .
but i am gonna take a sample .
help yourself .
thank you .
how many cattle do you have ?
must be about fifty head .
do they graze , or do you have ' em on feed ?
everybody around here uses the same feed .
specially in the winter time .
it ' s free .
i reckon it sweetens the pill .
what do you mean ?
what pill ?
company gives us free feed .
in exchange we gotta sell our cattle to host tender meats .
eike i said , the corporate machine .
corporations can do just about anything they want in this country .
amen to that .
can i get a batch of that feed ?
take whatever you want , doc .
what ' s that ?
anthelmintic .
it ' s totally safe .
it ' il kill the parasites ... but wont harm her at all .
i promise .
easy , girl .
easy , easy .
that should hopefully do it .
do me a favor .
call me if she gets any worse .
i' il let you know if anything out of the ordinary comes up .
i appreciate that , doc .
come on cooter .
come .
come on .
tom .
it ' s eli rudkus .
eli rudkus .
don' t hang up .
just listen .
i gotta send you a specimen .
specimen ?
what is it ?
it looks like a liver fluke .
doesn' t act like one .
i' ve never seen anything like this .
the last time this happened , you almost cost me my jb .
i know .
i just wanna know what these things are .
fine , just send it to me .
alright .
first thing in the morning .
i' il have it then .
thanks .
cooter !
come on .
cooter !
come on !
cooter !
cooter !
cooter !
dumb dog .
cooter ?
is that you ?
thank you .
that ' s enough .
take a seat everybody .
are we having a good time yet ?
i wanna welcome one and all .
to what ' s certainly gonna be another successful ... fund raiser for our fair town .
i also ... wanna offer my appreciation for those who participated in testing .
host tender meat ' s new feed .
we spent a lot of money and time on the research ... and the results , as you all know , have far exceeded our expectations .
we are going to be the sole supplier of a new class of beef .
healthier and tastier than anything on the market .
what does this mean for all of you ?
an increase of up to 12 %% ... in price per head .
you heard me right .
your cows are gonna be larger and stronger than ever .
and the meat .
sam , hold up one of those steaks .
i want you to tell me if that ' s not the best beef you' ve ever tasted .
you' ve all brought a good appetite so enough from me .
get on over there and have a good time , alright ?
thank you for coming out .
a vegetarian in beef country ?
i hope nobody will hold that against me .
around here , they just might .
eli rudkus .
how ya doing ?
milo turner .
who are you visiting in town ?
actually , i just moved here .
really ?
i got a .
i got a thing .
you' re the new vet .
felix' s replacement .
thought i' d come in early .
and get a head start drumming up a little business .
i got a little experience how small towns work .
what do you think of our town ?
i like it .
it ' s nice .
the people are friendly .
what more could you ask for ?
so what do you do here ?
there' s a bowling ally in town .
i mean like a job , like for work or .
host tender meats , head of r and d.
that ' s great .
you got a lot of people on that feed .
most use it .
some don' t .
why ?
well , i found some pretty interesting parasites ... in the feces of some of the cattle .
i can' t figure out where they came from .
i' m sure it ' s no big deal , it ' s just that i wanna know .
it can' t look too good for the new vet ... to come in town and get stumped right off the bat .
how' s your burger ?
i' m sure it ' il be okay .
i need this wrapped up by friday .
fax the paper work over to my office and i' il take care of it .
so , i hear we have a little problem .
good for you .
the only time lawyers make my money .
so what is it ?
the board' s serious about having you removed as president .
you don' t understand the gravity of the situation ?
have you any idea if they found out the costs of the clinical trials ?
the trials are fine .
i don' t need somebody ... questioning how i run my company .
to be honest with you , i can understand how they feel .
people think the money is landing in corporate benefit packages .
every penny was invested ... in the future of this company .
why don' t you show them that ?
i will , but not right now .
three months , i' il have the new meat on to market .
what do you want me to do ?
call the board .
convince them to give me the time i need .
you should' ve seen the ranchers when i said about the price increase .
and it was nothing , 12 %% .
i' m talking about a 3oo % % increase in profits !
if i report that to the board , they' il turn cartwheels .
and they' il stay off my back forever .
hailey ?
good to see you .
fletcher ... this is eli .
dr. eli rudkus , the new vet .
welcome to host , dr. rudkus .
call me eli .
we didn' t expect to see you so soon , did we milo ?
no , we didn' t .
excuse me .
why no one mentioned that the vet was arriving two weeks early ?
because no one knew .
someone should have , milo .
i tend to agree .
and he' s another felix .
already asking the wrong questions .
i got a table over there , if you wanna sit down .
you trying to pick me up ?
me ?
no .
god , no .
just trying to be friendly .
that ' s the host way .
where do you come from ?
eots of places .
so you' re a bit of a man of mystery ?
i wish .
no , absolutely not .
i' m completely harmless .
well , i' m not .
good to know .
patrick !
patrick !
hey you .
you having fun ?
you wanna play , too ?
jase , toss it to em .
i' il get it .
don' t worry .
i' il go after it .
jason .
mom !
what the hell is that ?
don' t know .
go check on it .
doc , come on .
eet me take a look .
what ' s this guy' s name ?
what ' s his name ?

patrick .

get back .
patrick , can you hear me ?
give me some room , please .
eet doc cummings do his work .
what ' s he doing , doctor ?
call an ambulance .
dispatch ?
we need an ambulance asap .
bell creek park .
a tender meats victim .
possible heart attack .
patrick whistler .
i understand , but i don' t believe it ' s even a remote possibility .
how can i put this ?
the parasites i found in that stream .
there' s frogs , too ... but that doesn' t mean they jumped on him and caused the heart attack .
i' m trying to be serious here .
so am i.
patrick stabilized .
great .
just do the test .
please .
i' il do the test if it will get you off my back .
but i' m not going to wake patrick up just to go to the bathroom .
so it may be a few hours or days , it depends on his regularity .
take my cell number .
call me if there' s a change in his condition .
thank you .
may i help you ?
no , i' m good .
thanks .
tom ridgeway .
hey , tom .
i don' t think we' ve seen a parasite like this before .
wait , it ' s not even in the international database ?
nope .
we ran it twice to be sure .
so we are ... ... looking at an entirely new species ?
0r a mutation of some sort .
it' s got a similarstructure to the common liver fluke .
i found more in the stream here so .
think we should definitely quarantine the cattle .
that would be prudent .
tom .
could you back me up on this ?
i have no choice , considering the test results , don' t you think ?
thank you .
i appreciate that .
sure , i mean .
eet me know if something happens .
absolutely .
alright .
tom ?
what is it ?
thank you .
no problem .
a city meeting .
hi .
my name is dr rudkus .
i know i' ve only been here a while , but i' ve come across something ... that could be a concern to all of us .
but before that , could i just get a show of hands ... of how many people here are having problem with parasites ?
right here .
right here .
that ' s what i thought .
the good news is i have isolated the parasite .
and i' ve sent a specimen off to the department of agriculture .
i don' t want to alarm anyone .
but the first thing we need to do is to quarantine the infected cattle .
quarantine ?
for worms ?
until we know what it is .
how long ?
how long ?
that ' s a good question .
as long as it takes .
and secondly , i need to recommend ... that we take everyone' s cattle off the host tender meats test feed .
there' s worms in the feed ?
it ' s not in the feed .
so why do we need to take ' em off ?
why take them off the feed ?
that ' s a good question .
because i believe ... the feed is causing the feces to have high concentrations of nitrates ... which are causing common parasites to become more active .
wonderful .
what exactly are these things ?
eike i said , we haven' t been able to identify them .
i send the ...
i' ve seen this before .
sometimes , not all the time , but when you introduce ... a new element into an existing ecosystem ... it can have a variety of effects in the various organisms ... that were present within that ecosystem .
come on people .
why does everybody act so surprised about all this ?
we' ve all been having trouble with our cattle for a long time .
nobody wants to say nothing , afraid to piss off the company .
fletcher and his stooges have been pushing us around for a long time .
so we get free feed ?
what ' s it matter .
when we gotta sell our cattle back to them at cut rate ?
see it ' s all about greed .
you seriously think that something like this couldn' t happen ?
they don' t care about us , only about making a buck off our backs .
so don' t be fools .
there' s something bad going on .
give ol ' doc eli here a chance , listen to what he' s got to say .
or you can follow these thugs right into the fiery gates of hell .
jacob !
easy , boy .
who you callin ' boy , ees ?
you the one that serves the man .
i' m not trying to alarm anyone .
but that ' s exactly what you do , isn' t it , dr. rudkus ?
dr. rudkus can no longer practice veterinary ... in the states of virginia or north carolina .
would you like to tell these people what happened ?
this has nothing to do with that .
he found a minor problem in the local water supply .
that ' s interesting .
algae causing bacteria to react ... polluting the water supply .
that ' s a minor problem to you ?
your actions shut down tourism and the pork industry ... costing the state 2oo million dollars in revenue .
the community was sucked dry by a naturally occurring event ... that happens once every fifty years ... and goes quietly away as appeared .
how do you explain that ?
all this talk about parasites ... is an attempt by rudkus to generate media exposure for himself ... at expense to host tender meats and host , missouri .
alright folks .
i think we' ve heard enough .
go on home now .
if you have trouble with your cattle or feed , i' il take care of it .
i' il take care of any problem you got .
at least you tried , doc .
it ' s a damn shame .
my great , great granddaddy started host tender in 1887 .
he salted and dried his own beef ... and sold it to the miners heading west to seek their fortune .
the company slowly grew over time .
until today the families of this town rely on us ... for their livelihood .
i' m not trying to threaten anyone' s livelihood .
you' re not ?
no .
do you think we can afford to pay good money for diseased cattle ?
who' s gonna buy it ?
and who' s gonna buy food and clothes for all the families of this town ?
you , dr. rudkus ?
if you think you can come into my home ... a town that i helped build ... and ruin it with your poison ... you are sadly mistaken .
what if i' m not mistaken ?
eet me guess .
you' re canceling your appointment ?
yeah , it ' s jacob eong .
what is it ?
you' d better get here fast .
she' s about to pop .
i' il be right there .
it ' s bad .
you better come on .
one minute , she' s as right as rain , the next thing .
is this ... is this how you left her ?
jacob ... was she like this ?
what was that ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
doc !
wait , wait , wait .
it ' s dead .
this is evidence .
i needed it alive !
it ' s better than the alternative now , isn' t it ?
what the hell is it ?
it ' s the parasite .
what ?
it ' s growing ... it ' s mutating ... evolving .
oh my .
that ' s vertebra .
they' il grow to 4 times this size .
what ?
you' re telling me this thing ate its way through my cow ?
this thing is gonna eat its way through ... anything that it once perceived was a viable host .
us , people .
those cysts , they' re in that stream .
guess it ain' t evidence no more .
teddy bear , what time are you picking me up ?
twenty minutes .
are you ready ?
almost .
just gotta put on some lipstick .
what are you wearing ?
undies .
0h my god .
you' re not !
unbelievable .
save some of that for later .
ted , are you okay ?
ted ?
ms. anderson .
i thought you might stop by .
what ' s patrick' s prognosis ?
it ' s hard to say .
he' s stable .
i' ve never seen anything like this .
mr. odermatt wants him to get the best medical attention .
at any cost .
mrs. whistler .
i' m fletcher odermatt ' s attorney .
is there any way we could help you ?
my husband' s in a coma .
they don' t know if or when he' il ever wake up .
i' m sorry .
he sent his condolences .
fletcher doesn' t care .
patrick worked there for 1o years ... not once got a raise .
they always talked about ' em .
instead we got picnics and pep talks .
doctor ?
patrick whistler just woke up .
how you feeling today ?
i don' t really know .
next time you decide to take a swim , i have a pool in my backyard ... and we' il put you in there .
we' re just going to check your eyes .
there we go .
hey sweetie .
how you feeling ?
i want you to come home soon .
what ' s happening ?
what ' s happening ?
i don' t really feel right .
get her out of here .
code blue .
code blue .
come on .
hang in there patrick .
stay with me .
excuse me .
we' re trying to find patrick whistler .

point and squeeze .
i can do that .
no , look .
jacob .
did you see it ?
i' m pretty sure it went that way .
eet ' s get it .
shoot it !
thanks , doc .
thought i was a goner .
yeah , me too .
that ' s a scary sound .
hi , dad .
hi , honey .
that ' s a nice watch .

one day it ' il be yours .
come on .
eet ' s wash up .
it ' s time for dinner .
all of those ?
what ' s it do ?
i don' t think so .
what ' s it do at the end ?
how' s it sound ?
who sells these things ?
it ' s scary .
i guess you like it , don' t you ?
did you buy it ?
i didn' t .
who did ?
i didn' t buy it .
you gave him the money .
i did not buy it .
well that ' il scare him .
see ?
is that how it .
do it again .
you hear it ?
there it is again .
i' il get it .
i' m aware of the situation .
keneth , it ' s under control .
what about him ?
he' s one of those environmental tree huggers .
if you' il excuse me , i' m in the middle of dinner with my family .
it ' s under control kenneth .
i' m handling it .
if anything changes , i' il call you back .
everything alright ?
i' s fine .
i have to go into the office for a few minutes .
fletcher .
i know .
i' il be back before dessert .
hey tiger , keep it cool .
i can' t believe this .
you don' t think all these people got one of them things inside them ?
that ' s exactly what i think .
lf all these people are infected .
it ' s about to get real messy .
we' d better get back to my place , pronto .
we need to figure out a way to contain these parasites .
meaning what , doc ?
nitrates .
i' m coming with you guys .
what for ?
you' re part of the problem .
you couldn' t possibly think i had anything to do with that !
well then , " aprs vous , mademoiselle .
giant what ?
sheriff , it ain' t normal .
they' re like aliens .
jimmy , you been making that moonshine again ?
0f course , but .

the hospital just called .
patrick whistler' s died .
somehow the vet ' s tied into it .
and haley , too .
she' s on the wrong side of this deal , now .
i' il see what i can do .
but we' re getting some pretty crazy calls .

i just was checking on patrick whistler .
whistler' s dead .
oh my god .
i warned you , fletcher .
the drugs are too unstable .
they' re not affecting the cattle , but the parasites , too .
milo , relax , will ya ?
there' s no proof of that .
the proof is in the meat .
eook for yourself .
alright .
all this stuff' s gotta be destroyed .
all the files on the experiment , the drugs , all of ' em .
this can' t be linked to us .
fletcher , people are dying .
felix warned us .
felix is gone .
and i if you don' t want to be gone , too , get to work .

do you ever wonder if one of those might be inside you right now ?
thank you .
i' il deal with you in a minute .

host tender meats ?
fletcher ?
i' il call you right back .

hey , mom ?
thanks , mom .

fletcher , i want out .
i know what you' re thinking .
but the reward was worth the risk .

we' il lay low .
it ' il all blow over and then it ' il all be back to normal .
i can' t do it .
i' m leaving .
i see .
i understand .
you don' t have the stomach .
felix felt the same way .
he felt bad lying to all the ranchers .
while he was shooting up their cattle with our cocktail .
i' m going to tell you the same thing i told him .
silence is golden .
milo , you didn' t believe all those rumors about felix being dead ?
you get out of my town .
don' t come back .
ever .
are we clear ?
mom !
mom !

you' il have to get over this .
you' re nearly 1o years old .
it ' s time to stop believing in monsters .

no monsters .
you know what this means ?
hi , this is madeline fletcher .
i can' t take yourcall right now .
you want a cup ?
it ' s fresh brewed .

oh my god .
shoot him .
you need to shoot him !
shoot him .
it ' s too late !
jacob , shoot him .
it ' s too late !
ees , time you started working for the people again .
thanks .
what the hell are these things ?
they' re just a parasite .
genetically altered feed .
the same feed that mutated the cattle ... ... has now mutated common fluke .
ain' t nothing common about ' em .
fletcher ordered the experiments before the trials were approved .
how do we stop ' em ?
shootin ' ' em seems to work fine .
we have a plan , sheriff .
but we' re gonna need access to the sewer system .
oh my .
madeline ?
madeline .
christopher ?
haley , start the engine and release the valve lock .
what ' s it look like ?
it should be a lever .
alright , that ' s it .
jacob , watch out !
your plan seems to be working .
the larva have shifted course .
i' m on my way to the sewers now .
almost there .
alright , doc .
we' re over the sewer .
connect the and let her rip .
we better get moving .
they' re gonna be on us like flies on buffalo chip .
i' il meet you down there .
ready to do some damage ?
always ready , ees .
you two keep spreading these bags of fertilizer .
doc , if i' m not back in two minutes .
you push that red button and blow the hell out of this place .
ready ees ?
eet ' s go .
eet ' s get it on .
careful with that dynamite .
don' t worry about me , partner .
i want you to take these sticks of dynamite .
set ' em about forty feet apart on both sides of that tunnel .
think this' il work ?
only one way to find out .
be careful out there .
alright .
that ' s about two minutes .
what are we gonna do ?
i know what we' re supposed to do .
eisten .
hang on !
where' s the sheriff ?
he should be here by now .
we gotta blow this thing .
i' m not going without him .
oh my god .
don' t shoot , it ' s me !
hold your fire !

just take it , alright ?
you know what to do .
y' all ain' t so bad .
eet ' s go , ees .
i' m getting too old for this .

come on , ees , do it .
a little bit more .
come on .

eet go !
it ' s too late .
