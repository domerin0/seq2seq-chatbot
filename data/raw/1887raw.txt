my last before the war ...
not all of us have a pretty woman to see us off .
don' t you have a friend ?
well ?
shall we move on ?
aren' t you singing ?
you like war ?
you' re going to shoot at strangers ?
want to sing with the krauts ?
why don' t you like peace ?
we' re at war !
the krauts are knocking at our door !
fighting won' t bring us peace .
doesn' t your country mean anything ?
what did you learn at school ?
why' s the lieutenant so quiet ?
he doesn' t like war either .
he' s scared .
let' s go .
go off and fight !
go , prove you' re a real man !
i don' t understand .
look at them run .
it' s absurd !
go on , catch your train .
leave me now .
your eyes contain no hate ...
you' re young ...
i don' t even know your name .
clmence .
no clemency in wartime ...
what' s going on ?
a spooked stallion , sir .
who requisitioned a stallion ?
geld the animal !
what happened ?
a stallion , sir .
a kick in the gut .
what should i do ?
fetch the chaplain .
lieutenant fournier reporting , sir .
at ease ...
i see in your file that you' ve studied engineering ...
yes , sir .
i need a bridge built .
take a detachment and find a suitable spot near chaumont .
by the way , you don' t happen to be related to colonel fournier at headquarters ?
your father , perhaps ?
my father' s dead .
how are your men ?
a little edgy , sir .
the germans won' t be here for a day or two .
fancy a glass , lieutenant ?
it shouldn' t last too long .
what do you think ?
he arrived this morning .
no one has dared touch him .
found six days ago ...
his lingual artery has been clogged by mud .
he' d have bled to death otherwise .
a pity he didn' t ...
is that him stinking like that ?
get him a medal while there' s still time .
what does he want ?
do you think he can hear ?
you want to say something ?
can you hear me ?
i don' t think he can hear .
i can hear yoi !
you' re alive , old chap .
you' re alive !
where am i ?
the face is split open from the chin to halfway up the nose , with destruction of upper right jawbone and palate .
partial destruction of the tongue , organs at the rear of the throat unprotected ...
am i making that noise ?
clean him and move him to the rear .
i can' t do anything here .
i can' t speak anymore .
i can' t speak anymore !
calm down .
let' s see ...
i can move my feet ...
both of them .
my hands ...
my hands are tied .
i can' t find my teeth ...
i can' t feel my teeth anymore !
my teeth have gone ...
my palate too ...
god , what has happened to me ?
it hirts ...
i hate that noise .
has the war started ?
are you all right ?
bit hot , isn' t it ?
get rid of these two , they' re dead .
we' ve got two others for you .
don' t worry ...
we' il clean you up .
give them water , they' re bloody suffocating !
god , what a stink !
here , drink this .
how can i make this one drink ?
he' il be all right till evening .
are you in pain ?
we' ve run out of morphine , and all the rest .
hang on !
you' il be in paris by morning .
the war' s over for you .
you' d rather have the rain ?
which one' s the officer ?
this one , i think .
are you an officer ?
shelter him .
he wants the rain , he' s feverish .
take him to the officers ' ward .
are you awake ?
you mustn' t sleep all the time .
it' s midday .
aren' t you hungry ?
let me help you to sit up .
is he awake ?
good day , lieutenant .
can you hear me ?
not too lonely ?
that' il soon change , i fear .
are you in pain ?
you' re not the kind to complain .
we' il feed you to build you back up .
i' il operate in a few days , to tidy you up .
then a long rest before we move onto serious things .
you' re in no hurry to fight again ?
does that hurt ?
arms or legs are easy , we just lop them off .
ajawbone is different .
a bone graft may well take .
it' s fascinating work .
more for me than for you , of course .
concentrate on two things : breathe well and eat well .
i' il see to the rest .
in a few months , you' il be as right as rain .
i' il be in to see you every morning .
give him morphine if he' s in pain .
but don' t let him get used to it .
it' s in short supply .
good bye , lieutenant .
if you want to say something , write it down .
oh , i' m sorry .
it' s not too hot ?
that' s good .
let' s take a little break .
is it good ?
you can' t tell .
thank you
anais .
and you' re adrien .
i have a son a bit younger than you .
he' s on the belgian front .
the news isn' t good .
it' s quiet up here .
downstairs , we' re running out of space .
i' ve brought you paper to write home .
to set your mother' s mind at rest .
i don' t want my mother to see me like this .
nor anyone else either .
thank god they' re far away .
stay where yoi are .
i' il visit as soon as i can .
things are chaotic here with all the wounded .
visitors aren' t allowed .
my war' s over .
i' ve done my duty .
that' s what matters .
no vital parts have been hit , not my eyes , legs or arms .
just a fractured collarbone .
i' il write as often as i can .
i' m perfectly safe here .
adrien .
no vital parts have been hit .
the collarbone ...
the collarbone' s nothing !
do you think it will last long ?
what' s all that noise ?
they' ve tied me down again .
why can' t i see anything ?
what' s that i feel ?
he' s operated on me .
he can' t have done much , it' s still as empty .
and that noise ...
i won' t speak again .
i' d rather not speak .
there' s another man ...
they' re worried i might scare him .
i' m the one who' s scared .
the thought of it scares me .
already awake ?
how do you feel today ?
does it feel tight ?
torn flesh contracts .
i' ve stretched it again .
now , we can rebuild .
i' il use newborn baby bone .
they' il let us know when one dies .
we have to bide our time .
breathe well , eat well .
no soup tonight .
you' re hot .
you have a fever .
you' re hot ...
you have a fever .
only deer antlers ever grow back .
he has to use deer horn .
i must stop thinking aboit her .
that' s all dead now .
i must tell him to use deer horn on me .
excuse me ...
lieutenant fournier .
are you family ?
we were students together .
i got his letter this morning .
how bad is he ?
it' s hot .
here .
you have to be brave .
is he dead ?
no .
is he going to die ?
no .
he needs peace and quiet .
don' t look away , that would hurt him even more .
he' s on the second floor .
the first ward .
adrien ?
i' m sorry ...
you want me to fetch your mail ?
the janitor has the keys ?
i' il go round .
i' ve brought you some ...
go away
i' il come back soon , i promise .
you' re a hero , adrien , a real hero .
dementia
lieutenant fournier .
wounded at the start of fighting .
the other two men are still unconscious ,
minister .
lieutenant , i' m here to express the country' s gratitude for the bravery and sacrifice that you have shown .
without men like you , the land of our fathers , that we must hand on to our children , would be overtaken by barbarity .
we' re proud of you .
where are you from , lieutenant ?
he can' t speak yet , minister .
i hope he can hear me at least .
your words have been noted for the press , minister .
good .
how many weeks will it be until he' s up and about ?
months would be more appropriate , sir .
ready to get back to the front ?
we need men like you .
good bye .
why are you out of bed ?
you mustn' t .
you might fall .
the sight that would have been ...
he congratulated you .
you can be proud of yourself .
he' s already forgotten me .
but i' m grateful .
at least he didn' t grimace on seeing me .
months woild be more appropriate ...
he thinks the war' s going to last ...
his stomach can' t take it .
it' s notjist my stomach .
i want to know what i look like .
i want to see .
you' il feel better in a few days .
mirror
the doctor said no .
if it was that bad , i couldn' t look at you .
i can see your whole soul in your eyes .
what state is that one in ?
i won' t bother getting ip .
i' il see him soon enoigh .
i couldn' t come any sooner .
this is all i found , on the table .
dear adrien , meeting again would be madness .
don' t be angry .
you understand why .
i' il never forget yoir eyes ,
yoir smile and yoir touch .
i wish you the best of luck .
clmence .
i' ve brought the papers .
do you read a bit ?
no , it tires you .
should i try to find her ?
berthelot and roy have hired me .
i design gun barrel casings .
that way i feel useful .
i' m painting again .
it' s pathetic in wartime but it helps me forget .
when i paint , i' m in another world .
draw me
no , i can' t .
why are you here ?
you can' t stay here .
off you go !
why aren' t we dead ?
i' d just flown over the front on my way back .
suddenly , a hail of bullets .
two krauts .
i never saw them coming .
my plane caught fire .
this tree came up at me .
the rest' s a blank .
your uncle' s downstairs .
please ...
he wants to reassure your mother .
what shall i tell him ?
you can' t hide forever .
we' il pill through
it snowed this morning .
we were at the window like children .
two nurses threw snowballs .
we almost went and joined them .
our uncle came .
i warned you they' d turn him away .
he left me some ham , sausage and tobacco .
i shared it with the others .
pierre , a pilot , henri , a breton ,
and loiis , a new arrival .
i' ve brought you some cigarettes .
nice smell ?
we had a proper christmas .
i' d have liked to be with you .
bit the nirses , especially anais ,
helped us forget the war and the ward .
sometimes ,
i forget i' ve been woinded .
how' s the graft taking ?
you' il have a greek nose .
no , a jewish one .

so my mother will know me .
she' il know you , i promise .

what' s your name ?
henri ...
did you hear that ?
you will too .
i' m operating tomorrow .
a baby died last night .
they' re preparing everything .
you' il wake tomorrow with a brand new mouth .
it' s a world first .
medicine is making giant strides .
can i speak ?
i can' t do it .
i' il never manage it .
it' s no use ...
it hirts .
are you all right ?
there' s a corpse in my mouth .
does it hurt ?
i wish it was daytime .
i' m scared .
i' m going to pray for you .
you' il be all right .
i don' t believe in god .
it' s absurd .
i have to calm myself down .
i' ve never known anyone so calm .
what' s all this ?
it' s him .
his face gives me nightmares .
how do you feel today ?
they' re sending two other girls up .
the chief medical officer blew his top .
there was a bit of flirting going on downstairs .
ccile ...
adrien' s been here for six months .
he' s a bit like a son for me .
flirting while her husband' s on the front ?
clmence didn' t even wait .
i' il be right back .
i' il find her .
i' m already old , i' m a monster .
i want to see her fade , grow ugly and wrinkled ...
this girl' s pretty .
i want to touch her .
sorry , did i hurt you ?
why is it hirting today ?
i mistn' t think about the pain .

her skin' s so soft ...
