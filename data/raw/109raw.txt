since the time immemorial , the knights who called themselves the " warriors of light " have been chasing witches and sorcerers who torture humans .
but one day , their path was barred by the warriors of darkness .
and no one wanted to make way .
and the battle started , bloody and merciless .
as the battle reached heaven ,
great gesser saw they were equal , and if the battle is not stopped , everyone perishes .
so he stopped the battle .
so the forces of light and the forces of darkness signed the armistice .
and it was said that from that time on neither good nor evil can be made without mutual consent .
and it was said there shall be the day watch to watch over the forces of light .
and it was said there shall be the night watch to watch over the forces of darkness .
yet in a thousand years , the great other will come and take the side of evil , and the world will be plunged into the darkness .

i should know for sure what' s gonna happen in moscow in the next 24 hours .
city light company .
incldents
the flight moscow antalia crashed over moscow .
pilot in command and the crew of il84 the flight 99753 moscow antalia ...
the flight time 4 hours 20 minutes .
i left my swimsuit in the hotel .
i took it .
you were in the room ?
so what ?
did you look in the mirror ?
why ?
jesus , don' t start that again .
let' s skip the flight .
then skip it .
here she is .
the virgin .
there lived a virgin in byzantum , and someone wished her evil and cursed her .
wherever she trod , bad luck lurked over her head .
she took a candle , and the candle died down .
she petted a puppy , and the puppy died .
a bird that ate from her hand fell to the ground .
in the houses she visited children died .
the darkness and ravage ruled the city .
the ravage and darkness .
so warriors stepped from the dark who called themselves the warriors of darkness .
and from among the people those stepped out who called themselves the warriors of light .
and the great battle between dark and light began .
but no one could win , for they were equal .
it will be so until a man emerges who is fated to become the great one .
if he takes the side of light , the light wins .
but those who know the truth say he' d choose the darkness .
for it' s easier to kill the light in oneself than to scatter the darkness .
the prophecy comes true .
pass me on to alice .
it' s zawulon .
i can' t talk at the moment .
you know what happened ?
no .
your hairdresser .
they bashed his head against the basin .
bring me the one who did this .
i' m coming .
we' il train his girlfriend .
the one with the scorched face .
clc issued the license on her to the hairdresser ,
i mean , allowed to gobble her up .
it turned out they knew each other .
she offered him her throat .
i warned her , i did .
you can' t tell enough , they' re young and unafraid .
they caught them on live bait .
now she' s starved .
give me .
are you salivating ?
give me .
andrey taught you to call .
well , he did .
give me .
the kid answered your call .
lure him out .
and when he' s in your hands , demand to see the one who killed your andrey .
my andrey .
give me , please .
give it to me !
do you want a revenge ?
don' t torture her .
please ?
she' il sure find him now .
how ?
she' il find him .
like a dog .
come to me .
where are you going ?
i have to find him .
find whom ?
the boy .
where are you going ?
you' re barely alive .
we shouldn' t' ve charged you with field work .
to drink blood and catch vampires is not for you .
it' s not the point .
what is ?
we license them ourselves .
so ?
and then we use our live bait to catch them .
who said it ?
whose words are those ?
those are my words .
it' s me who says it .
you don' t know anything .
sitting here , you don' t know anything .
it was a child .
a child .
he' s like a bitten sandwich to her now .
torn from her mouth in the last moment .
if i don' t find him , she' il do it .
wait .
i' il give you a partner .
you' ve killed a dark one , anton .
zawulon won' t forgive you for that .
you need protection .
what' s this ?
it' s olga .
she' il help you .
why do i need it ?
it' s your choice .
from our last program we learnt how to use live bait .
today let' s talk about owls .
owls are a special case of nocturnal predators .
only an owl can look at an object with both eyes at a time due to their evolved adaptation .
owls mostly are nocturnal species .
owls can see the heat their victim' s body emanates .
owl' s eye can perceive invisible infra red rays .
managed to foist it off .
the predator who has a peculiarity ...
i didn' t want to kill !
owls feed on animal life , small animals and birds .
check out where she lives and works .
all her contacts in the last 3 days .
who could send this damned curse ?
and when ?
this is a matter of minutes now , mind it .
i met a curse that strong 118 years ago .
i see .
how much time do we have ?
no time .
is it her ?
yes , svetlana nazarova , aged 29 , she works in the clinic no 17 .
has never come in view of the night watch .
lives with her mother in 37 , vatutinki , bldg a.
it' s close to vnukovo airport .
mom is hospitalized , kidney problem , a grafting is necessary .
a friend' s kid is sick , she visited them .
here' s another victim , their neighbor auntie valya , aged 78 .
she' s a tough woman , yet called the ambulance .
that witch gave her a bad look .
how do you do .
hello , sveta .
what kind of a dog is that ?
maxim brought from work , and i don' t know what to do with it .

turn away .
don' t look .
don' t turn
you ...
turn away .
are you scared ?
the shower is there .
why did they do it to you ?
it' s a punishment .
how do they spin it ?
up left is hot , right is cold .
no ...
but yes .
i' ve never heard of punishments like this .
you' ve never heard of crimes like this .
d' you have anything to change into ?
in a moment .
do you have any woman' s clothes by any chance ?
what ?
i' m sorry , it' s just in case .
here , i have it from my mom .
thanks .
anything wrong ?
no .
step inside .
you know , anton , there are too few of us left .
and when someone goes away for good , all of us feel it immediately .
that' s how the world spins , neighbor .
there' s an agreement .
you understand what i say .
what , anton ?
yours and ours have struck a deal that everything may be done but in turns .
i still don' t get one thing .
