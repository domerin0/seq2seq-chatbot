hey , you got the kellers .
we' re out having a good time , so leave a message .
hey , you got the kellers .
we' re out having a good time , so leave a message .
silvia ?
rudy thought he had a flute lesson tonight .
will you call me when you get in ?
you know , they make new ones now .
yeah , i know .
portuguese .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in matobo has now become critical .
with ajene xola in hiding and kuman kuman in exile ,
edmond zuwanie has few domestic obstacles ... to his policy of ethnic cleansing .
the security council therefore must press for his immediate referral ... to the lnternational criminal court in the hague .
miss broome .
i' m jonathan williams , ambassador harris' s adviser .
we need you for a few minutes .
which language ?
the matoban ambassador .
he' il speak ku .
ku ?
you speak the language , don' t you ?
let' s be clear , mr ambassador .
the united states may not recognise the lcc as a legitimate court , but we do not condone the methods president zuwanie uses against his people .
dr zuwanie is an educator .
he is ... our teacher .
but his opponents engage in ever more ferocious acts .
the partisans of both kuman kuman and ajene xola have become ... terrorists .
the french proposal is a diplomatic headache for both of us .
what a predicament .
it doesn' t have to be .
dr zuwanie wouldn' t have to appear before the lnternational criminal court .
not if he were somewhere else .
do you want him to resign ?
tell him this .
lf he goes voluntarily , we' re confident the french proposal will be vetoed .
you can tell him yourself .
he will be here next friday , exercising his right to speak before the general assembly , where he will announce a new programme of democratic reform .
perhaps then there will be no vote and your predicament will disappear .
it will end here .
the teacher will never leave this room alive .
that' s it .
the teacher will never leave this room alive .
word for word .
and what language did you say ?
ku .
it' s a tribal dialect of matoban , spoken throughout the south central african belt .
did you see anyone ?
no , but i think that they saw me .
why didn' t you report this last night ?
it didn' t mean anything to me at the time .
rather , i didn' t know what it meant .
but now you do .
i heard something today .
i don' t know if i' m permitted .
it was in a closed ...
you are .
ln fact , you' re obligated , as you were last night when you didn' t .
i think they were talking about edmond zuwanie .
he' s planning to come here to address the ga .
can you see her ?
turn on the light .
call the secret service .
bet you really miss this .
welcome back .
ma' am ?
excuse me .
please don' t touch the prime minister .
i need you to step back , please .
woods .
the first of the demonstrators .
they' re here to protest the appearance later this week by edmond zuwanie .
not just his political future but any future for him ... hinges on that speech to the general assembly .
dr zuwanie is accused of genocide , but he' s expected to argue that his actions were a defensive response to terrorism ... and not acts of aggression , as some security council members have charged .
secret service .
just a moment , please .
we' re with foreign dignitary protection .
it' s a branch of the us government .
dot .
this is international territory .
i need you to wait for an escort .
zuwanie lands at 8 . 45 hours .
state department says no meet and greet , no shopping , no lion king .
he leaves your podium , his plane has two hours to clear us airspace , unless the un cancels the visit ... and tobin and i can get back to the important work we were doing .
that' s up to the ga president .
we just present a threat assessment .
why is he coming ?
to make a speech .
to escape the lnternational criminal court .
security council was debating whether to bring charges of ethnic cleansing , so he' il come , talk about free elections and reform ... and pray that that appeases everyone .
so the stakes are high .
he' s not going to cancel .
tell me about the interpreter .
born here , but lived mostly in africa and europe .
she studied music in johannesburg ... and linguistics at the sorbonne and various countries in europe .
parents ?
british mother , white african father .
moved here five years ago .
lnterview couldn' t have taken long .
she' s just what they want .
she is the un .
can she cook ?
what else do we know ?
since the initial clearance .
ls she married ?
does she have a child ?
does she belong to any clubs ?
ls she registered to vote ?
democrat ?
republican ?
what religion is she ?
who is she ?
silvia .
secret service dignitary protection squad .
we' re responsible for visiting heads of state .
i don' t recall seeing you around .
they hire us for our forgettable faces .
ls she on guard ?
yes , ma' am .
ma' am .
why is it you guys who carry guns always sound like cowboys ?
i don' t concentrate on faces in my job .
but you listen to voices .
do you think you could identify the voice ?
well , i' d say yes , if it were ...
it was almost a whisper .
whispers disguise the quality of a voice .
you , i imagine , study faces .
you know , i' m not really a dignitary .
i know .
how' d you happen to be up there after hours ?
we had an evacuation .
i' d left some things in the sound booth .
and there just happened to be some fellas talking about an assassination ... in a language that you and eight other people understand , in a room full of microphones .
do you think i' m making it up ?
why would i report a threat i didn' t hear ?
people do .
i don' t .
some people like attention .
i don' t .
you don' t want zuwanie here .
i didn' t make it up .
how do you feel about him ?
i don' t care for him .
wouldn' t mind if he were dead ?
lf he were gone .
same thing .
no , it isn' t .
lf i interpreted " gone " as " dead " , i' d be fired .
lf they were the same , there' d be no un .
your profession is playing with words .
i don' t play with words .
you' re doing it now .
you are .
lf i wanted him dead , i wouldn' t have reported it .
it' s not what i want .
that' s not why i' m here .
here ?
working at the un , instead of standing on a road somewhere with a machine gun .
you believe in diplomacy ?
i believe in this place .
i believe in what it tries to accomplish .
well , you' ve had a tough year , lady .
listen .
i' m scared , and my protector is someone who doesn' t believe me .
you don' t look scared .
people handle fear in different ways , mr keller .
it turns some people into stand up comedians .
you don' t know me at all .
maybe i should see about assigning someone ... to look after me who' s better suited to the job .
i don' t look after you ,
i look after the man who' s been threatened , if there was a threat .
my job , as it concerns you , is to investigate you .
so you' re not here to offer me any protection whatsoever ?
no , ma' am .
and we were getting along so well .
so what do you think ?
she' s a liar .
agent keller ?
morning .
special agent lewis , fbl .
this is agent king .
we' re on loan .
so they have to be returned in the same condition , or no refund .
keller .
woods .
are you sure you' re ready to come back ?
i' m better working .
we got a credible threat ?
we should assume so .
as popular as we are in the rest of the world , the last thing we need is to have a foreign leader get popped here , particularly a guy like this that we don' t like .
so state wants you to know , nsa , cla , fbl , whatever you need to keep this maniac' s heart beating till he gets out , it' s yours .
woods .
zuwanie' s head of security' s arrived .
he wants a meeting right away .
he' il have to wait till we get back from washington .
he' s white .
he was a dutch mercenary .
he' il still have to wait .
it' s hard to remember that zuwanie was once a good man .
that' s not unusual for these guys .
they begin as liberators .
20 minutes later , they' re as corrupt as the tyrants they topple .
he liberated the country from one of the most corrupt governments on earth , gave the people hope , and was a hero .
they need another name for what he is now .
man likes his gun .
he' il have it with him .
he knows he won' t be scanned .
who are his enemies ?
aside from the thousands of victims ' relatives ?
these two .
both his opponents , both want his job .
on the right , ajene xola .
son of a doctor , paris educated , pacifist to begin with .
aren' t they all ?
he managed longer than most .
and the other ?
he has two names , he' s always in the post .
one name , twice .
kuman kuman .
he' s been yelling about zuwanie being a madman and the un not doing enough .
he' s in exile in brooklyn .
a socialist and a capitalist , both gaining strength with the people , both with the motivation to see zuwanie gone .
gone ?
dead .
but not just dead .
dead in front of the delegates of 1 91 countries ... and every news service with a camera .
ln front of the world .
nobody needs to be that dead .
ln my opinion , we' re wasting tax dollars staying late .
it' s a con .
this is the interpreter ?
i need everything cla has on her .
so what do we make of this interpreter ?
ls she making it up ? ls she imagining things ?
i' m looking for mr lud .
ls she pretty ?
i brought you a copy of her un file .
dr zuwanie won' t cancel his speech , you know .
that' s up to the ga president , but you might want to think about it .
ms broome has a matoban passport .
excuse me ?
she was born here , she was raised there , so she has dual citizenship .
are you serious ?
black or white ?
no , thank you .
ls she black or white ?
white .
did you give her a polygraph test ?
not yet , no .
well , shouldn' t you ?
hi , ma .
back off , you' re too close .
way too close .
what are you , on a date ?
hey , you got the kellers .
we' re out having a good time , so leave a message .
hey , you there ?
maybe i made a mistake .
are you there ?
shit .
i told him i want to come back .
he' s dropping me off at the airport now , and i was wondering ...
anyway , you don' t have to meet me .
unless you want to .
i hope you haven' t changed the locks .
lf i were roy rogers i' d sure enough be single ...
it' d just be me and trigger we' d go riding through them movies ...
they' re ready for you .
i' il be right there .
i' il be right there .
ok .
ms broome .
can i get you anything ?
how about a hood ?
i want to split that .
when do i know the results ?
right away .
you know when you' re lying , don' t you ?
look straight ahead , feet flat on the floor .
ls your name silvia broome ?
miss broome ?
i found out something from our domestic lntel .
all this may have begun with a tragic accident .
what do you mean ?
her parents farmed in the mountains .
this area became infested with rebels in the ' 80s ... and dr zuwanie was forced to mine the roads .
her parents were bringing her younger sister back from school and hit a mine .
and they were killed ?
all of them .
how old was she ?
1 2 , 1 3 .
something like that , even years later , could incite all kinds of ideas .
she has every reason to want dr zuwanie tried at the lcc .
i' il be right back .
oh , no .
come on .
ok , the control questions show stress , and the key questions show stress as well as the baseline questions .
we should just read her palm .
how did i do ?
je ne sais pas .
nils lud .
dr zuwanie' s head of security .
i thought since you were in a question answering mood , i might ask a few .
might i ask where you stand now politically , miss broome ?
i' m for peace and quiet , mr lud .
it' s why i came to the un .
quiet diplomacy .
with respect , you only interpret .
countries have gone to war after misinterpreting one another .
i would say she' s clearly under stress , but not necessarily lying .
congratulations .
i' m told what you heard was a whisper .
yes .
ls it possible you could identify it if you ever heard it again ?
it might be .
tell me , do you have a brother ?
i hope it' s all right .
i took this opportunity to ask miss broome a few questions .
you' re free to go .
agent scott will drive you back to the un .
would you drive ms broome back to the un , please ?
thank you .
does this mean the test was ... ?
the test was inconclusive .
but i' d rather make the mistake of believing her than the bigger one of not .
next time you want to question an american citizen here , you ask permission .
silvia .
don' t worry , i' m not leaving any ...
did you do something naughty ?
a couple of fbls were asking me about you .
lf you often work later than everybody , or bring things in after hours .
like that .
what' d you tell them ?
i said , from a sound engineer' s point of view , you' re perfect .
i need somebody on the guy with two names .
mo .
it' s one name twice .
kuman kuman .
you volunteering , or just correcting me ?
i' m from brooklyn .
you got him .
you and ... ?
i was on him when he first came here .
ok , you got him again .
i thought she had perfect pitch .
she says whispers don' t have a recognisable pitch .
nsa agrees .
they say it' s very difficult .
they don' t know that .
they say they do .
no , not nsa .
whoever she heard .
why not let them keep thinking she can ld it ?
what are you asking me to do , jay ?
i don' t want her to be harmed .
ln fact , get a place , keep an eye on her .
we got three days .
she' s your only link .
are we using her as bait ?
just make the calls .
i' m sending you an attachment .
can you print front and back ?
i' ve asked lns for a list of arrivals in the last six months .
zimbabwe , botswana , matobo .
i' il do voice samples on everyone .
so when she hears the voice again , she can identify it .
she said it was a whisper .
well , now she thinks she can do it .
photo there yet ?
it' s printing .
let me put you on speaker .
that' s an anti zuwanie rally .
the man speaking is ajene xola .
look at the crowd .
look closely .
any leads ?
maybe one .
come on down to mexico .
ls that you ?
tell me what someone like you ... who uses the word " diplomacy " like she' s chastising me ... is doing at a rebel rally ?
a peace rally .
i don' t want to do this again .
that' s exactly what it is .
what i' m doing is listening .
after that .
after you listen .
you' re asking the wrong question .
it' s one you don' t want to answer .
why would somebody type the names of everyone in this on the back ?
this is a death list .
the question you should be asking is , " who gave me this and why ? " ...
what are you not saying ?
what are you accusing me of ?
how do you feel about zuwanie , never mind " i don' t care for him " ?
i feel disappointment .
that' s a lover' s word .
what about rage ?
of all the people i' ve looked into since this thing started , the one with the darkest zuwanie history is you .
it was his land mines that killed your ...
sh !
we don' t name the dead .
everyone who loses somebody wants revenge , on god if they can' t find anyone else .
but in africa , in matobo , the ku believe that the only way to end grief is to save a life .
lf someone is murdered , a year of mourning ends with a ritual that we call the drowning man trial .
there' s an all night party beside a river .
at dawn , the killer is put in a boat .
he' s taken out on the water and he' s dropped .
he' s bound so that he can' t swim .
the family of the dead then has to choose .
they can let him drown , or they can save him .
the ku believe that if the family lets the killer drown , they' il have justice but spend the rest of their lives in mourning .
but if they save him , if they admit that life isn' t always just ... .. that very act can take away their sorrow .
vengeance is a lazy form of grief .
why do you look away ?
there are things i don' t like to talk about and you call it lying .
but not when you do it .
i' m not the one under investigation .
that was a long time ago .
fbl .
lntel .
ttf .
sniper team .
secret service .
this is nils lud , head of dr zuwanie' s security .
shall we take a walk ?
how close can a vehicle get over here ?
not close enough .
no garage under the ga .
dogs sweep every night .
it' s not a bomb .
it has to be a rifle .
from where ?
how does he get a rifle in ?
could be from up close .
who gets that close ?
one of zuwanie' s bodyguards ?
that' s a good thought , but we' d much prefer to kill him at home without you watching .
it' s already here .
lf these guys know their stuff , the weapon is here .
hello ?
hello , philippe ?
hello ?
no prints on the door and negative for latex dust .
nothing on the door ?
no .
no forced entry .
did doug not see him ?
no , he missed it .
some lady called 91 1 , saw the guy .
go easy on him , ok ?
he feels terrible .
on the roof .
he must have gone over the roof to get to the next building .
i couldn' t see the fire escape .
give me that .
you mean you screwed up .
i mean i screwed up .
so did l .
i need polaroids of that , inside and out .
you ok ?
great .
who else has a key to this apartment ?
no one .
you don' t keep a spare outside somewhere ?
no .
no one else has a key ...
nobody .
the door wasn' t forced .
they can' t pick locks ?
they can , we can tell .
they didn' t .
where do you keep your key ?
my purse .
it hasn' t been out of your sight all day ?
no .
yes .
ln my locker .
dot .
wake up rory , have him dust her locker and those beside it before morning .
so you were just having a quiet evening , some gentleman in a mask waves to you .
that' s about it , yeah .
dot ?
ls there anything special about this mask ?
i' il be honest with you .
i don' t know how honest i can be with you .
my brother gave it to me .
i still have a brother there who i' m close to .
simon .
we' ve ... lost touch for a while , but ... we' re close .
ls he standing on the road somewhere with a machine gun , or is he into diplomacy , too ?
he' s more into lists .
farm kids will do anything to amuse themselves .
mostly you fight .
i read .
my brother kept lists .
weird lists in ratty notebooks .
times and dates that mum used the f word , countries with advantageous male to female ratios , odd animal facts .
did you know the leading cause of death for beavers is falling trees ?
yes .
you did not .
he had a notebook for words that he liked .
hypotenuse , doodad , bodacious .
could he be involved in this ?
we' re stuck , aren' t we ?
you and l ?
we' re kepla .
it means standing on opposite sides of the river .
give me a reason to get to the other side .
just wait a second .
ok .
there' s a blue and white outside .
nypd' il keep an eye on you until morning .
and then ?
we' il figure something out .
thank you .
my wife was killed two weeks ago .
she ... she' d left me .
she' d left me before , but she' d always come back .
she was going to come back this time .
she said .
she was a dancer .
the guy was a dancer , too .
eddie .
great dancer .
lousy driver .
the only way he knew how to stop a car ... was to slam it into a bridge abutment in santa fe .
so there was no taking her back this time .
the thing is , if he had lived , and i had a choice ...
..
i think i would have let him drown .
i might have even held his head under the water .
not a very ku thing to do .
lf you need anything , you can call the precinct ... or just go downstairs .
this is my cell number .
it' s the same card .
goodnight .
lock this .
it' s a remodel .
owner' s in the middle of a divorce .
we got lucky .
we got a clear view .
front door' s 50 seconds away .
i' il do first shift .
are lewis and clark babysitting kuman ?
lewis and king .
he' il be in bed soon .
fbl' s right .
guy does the same routine every day .
call me if she gets another trick or treater .
i' m off .
sweet dreams , partner .
.. the belief that the individual needs of people ... are paramount to its purpose , and with it goes the assumption ... that human rights are fundamental to human prosperity and development .
they cannot be separated .
they can only be said to exist ...
you got one shot .
you sever the brain stem , creating paralysis , you drop the perpetrator without reflex action .
he can' t activate a detonator .
thank you .
lf you have to issue a verbal warning , you get very close before you do so .
no .
there won' t be time for a second one .
whatever the weapon is , consider this a suicide bomber .
there' s no profile for a suicide bomber .
this could be nine or 90 , male or female , a phd or a dropout .
all they have in common is they are not afraid to die .
so this is either a fanatic for a cause or someone who has nothing to live for .
we' il run two teams .
ddo calls the decoy exit 30 seconds before the intersection .
nypd snipers from these two buildings here , our guys sniper the bridge .
her locker was clean .
the others were covered with prints .
someone wiped hers .
we' re looking at a janitor or a maintenance worker .
or another interpreter .
so when do we do this voice line up ?
we' re not doing that any more .
she says she can' t .
can' t what ?
ld the voice .
she thought she could , now she thinks she can' t .
she' s sure she can' t .
she can' t because she can' t , or because she never heard anything to start with ?
he says he wasn' t here ...
i think .
not according to this .
he traded shifts with someone .
com quem ?
jamal .
jad jamal .
he' s in crown heights .
afternoon .
secret service .
need to talk to jad jamal .
does this guy live here ?
no , no here .
with lady .
you got lady' s number ?
does he have a cell phone ?
ok , we' il be back . lf he shows up before that , have him give us a call .
hello ?
silvia , c' est moi .
philippe .
philippe .
going out .
i got her .
shit .
shit .
oh , come on .
philippe .
what is it ?
i' ve done a terrible thing .
it is simon .
no , listen .
someone contacted me .
one of kuman' s people ...
i thought it was one of his people ... to arrange a meeting with xola .
they said it was time to admit that only together could they stop zuwanie .
what happened ?
so i arrange it .
but it was a trap .
xola' s dead .
i knew it .
i knew he was dead .
was my brother there ?
no , simon wasn' t there .
only xola .
i stayed in the car .
no one came back out .
where is he ?
where' s my brother ?
i don' t know .
you think kuman has him ?
i don' t know what to think .
everything is chaos .
it' s all gone to hell .
how did it get to be like this ?
you see what i did ?
i took xola right to them .
you didn' t know .
forgive me .
i was only trying to help .
there' s nothing to forgive .
yes , there is .
i have to go .
philippe .
you cannot do that .
how the hell do i protect you if i don' t know where you are ?
you emphatically told me that you weren' t .
that was before you had a man in a mask on your fire escape .
i' ve had a 24 hour shift of agents across the street .
who was that in the park ?
it' s personal .
we' re past that .
what' s his name ?
it' s not your business .
ls he the one you e mailed before reporting the threat ?
where are you ?
i' m worried about you .
write me . " ...
please .
i need to know you' re ok " ?
worried why ?
because he' s involved ?
ls that him , here , now , in my country , making threats ?
that is my business .
you' re wrong .
it' s got nothing to do with you .
i' il take care of you .
i' m going to starbucks .
want anything ?
just what i need , another night without sleep .
i' m good .
thanks .
what' s up with common kuman ?
brushing his teeth .
i gotta talk to him .
caf atlantic , noon to two , then the nava club for a steam and massage .
coffee ?
no , i' m good , thanks .
she can' t sleep either .
just turned the tv on .
probably pbs .
where you going ?
you' re here with your bag .
i can go home and get a good night' s sleep .
unless you want me to stay .
no .
thanks .
thanks .
i' il see you tomorrow .
united nations , new york .
protests erupted here following an announcement ... that president edmond zuwanie will address the general assembly friday .
the exiled leader kuman kuman rallied today' s protesters .
he would be more convincing if he were assassinated .
he doesn' t even have to die .
an almost assassinated leader gets so much credibility , he can do anything he wants ... and stick around to enjoy it .
security is on heightened alert in response to anonymous threats ...
keller . .. l' m sorry .
i really didn' t know you were watching me ... .. or i wouldn' t have just ... left like that .
you want to tell me what happened ?
i had to meet someone .
philippe broullet .
lf you knew , why did you ask ?
i know his name , i know he' s a photographer for a french magazine .
he needed to talk to me .
now you' re watching tv , unable to sleep .
what did he say ?
how do you know i' m ... ?
are you over there ?
jesus .
he told me we lost a friend .
he lost a friend .
i ... lost someone i loved once .
it was a long time ago .
you can' t sleep either .
i don' t know why i' m calling you .
what do you do when you can' t sleep ?
i stay awake .
you don' t name the dead , you said .
why ?
what ... what happens ?
you move past them .
you leave them behind .
you can do that , but you have to be ready to let them go .
to move on .
you' ve been going through hell .
keeping busy .
you , too , i think .
i don' t know all of it , but ...
are you going to be there until morning ?
it almost is morning .
yeah , i' il be here .
ls it ok if i just try to fall asleep over the phone ?
that' s fine .
goodnight .
she' s coming your way .
oh , no .
no scooter , please .
come on , no scooter .
yes .
thank you , god .
you might as well drive me .
we' re going to brooklyn .
corner of bergen and nostrand .
jad jamal .
worked the interpreters ' lounge the day the mask showed up .
bring him to me .
can' t .
he didn' t show up for work .
sit on his apartment .
doug' s there .
hey .
got the lns files .
this isn' t the way it' s supposed to be done .
you can let me off up here .
she' s at the corner of bergen and nostrand in brooklyn .
she' s where ?
my guy' s on the move .
she' s here , whether i brought her or not .
go back .
what' s she doing ?
waiting for something .
holy shit .

the janitor .
jad jamal .
that' s not him .
i know .
that' s his room mate .
jamal' s room mate just left the building .
his name is gamba .
jean gamba .
should i stay here ?
no , you stick with the room mate .
are we working on a warrant ?
lewis is .
how are you ?
i got something for you .
ok , bless you .
tobin ?
what' s up ?
i don' t know , but it don' t feel good .
what are they doing ?
just standing there .
we' re getting on the el .
shit .
she just got on the bus with kuman .
what the hell is she doing ?
did i hear home ?
or was i wrong , then ?
no , you' re right .
i' m matoban .
and a fair matoban , in fact .
king , you stay with that bus .
do you know who i am ?
yes .
you' re a killer .
you ordered the murder of ajene xola .
you got a red light in that car ?
why don' t you use it ?
who told you this nonsense ?
where' s my brother ?
your brother ?
i don' t even know who you are .
you are on the wrong bus , so to speak , to be so reckless .
your people arranged a meeting through philippe broullet .
you know him .
i don' t ... and i didn' t .
but the fact is , somebody wants you to believe that i killed ajene xola .
l don' t believe you .
but you should believe me .
why ?
because i would form a coalition with xola .
neither of us have made enough progress alone .
he has the working people .
i have the finances .
lf he is dead , it is a loss for all of us .
me especially .
we' re getting off .
l got the back room .
jesus .
clear the other room .
ok .
closet .
yeah .
i got the bed .
.. ho !
keller ?
we got a dead body in the closet .
jamal ?
yeah .
i' il call it in .
god , how can you see in here ?
wait .
wait .
why the lanterns ?
well , that' s just rude .
what do you do so far away from home ?
i work .
and i hope .
same as me , then .
i doubt it .
you work for ... ?
l' m an interpreter at the un .
so like the un .
layers of languages signifying nothing .
you' d prefer more war ?
i prefer more business .
guys , get with me here .
we got a situation .
no , boss , we got a situation .
we just got on the 1 33 .
with mohammad .
and silvia broome .
and kuman kuman .

with our subjects .
get off the bus , and get silvia broome off that bus now .
we can' t do that .
we' re moving .
doug , is the room mate carrying anything ?
doug , is he carrying anything ?
a satchel .
all right ... where is it ?
it' s in his lap .
he' s been carrying it all day .
oh , man .
can either of you get to him ?
not without gettin ' made .
despite all the flags on first avenue , there are no nations any more .
only companies . lnternational companies .
it' s where we are .
it' s what we are .
l think you' re wrong .
you are still young .
i' m an acquired taste .
what' s your brother' s name ?
simon .
simon broome .
ok , we' re stopping .
you got guts , coming out here .
l' il see what my people can find out about him .
but remember , i' m not your brother' s keeper , eh ?
yeah .
thank you .
come on , guys , talk to me .
what' s going on ?
we' re stopped .
she' s getting off .
what' s going on ?
and so is my subject .
keep talking to me .
what' s going on ?
ls he carrying the satchel ?
ok , he' s got the satchel .
but i think he made me .
that' s ok , i got him .

he' s staying put .
miss broome !
please get in the car .
move it !
l got gamba .
i' il stay with kuman .
no .
just get off that bus .
get everybody off that bus right now !
doug !
mohammad ?
hey !
guy forgot his lunch .
oh , man .
l' m standing here on nostrand avenue in crown heights , at a scene that can only be described as unconscionable carnage .
.. frantically helping victims of an apparent terrorist attack .
these events are more familiar in the cities of the middle east .
there is no word yet .
however , there are unconfirmed reports ... that kuman kuman , the exiled matoban revolutionary , may have been on board .
you all right ?
i' m ok .
doug ?
this is ron ferguson , reporting live on nostrand avenue in brooklyn , where just after 1 0 . 30 am this morning ...
we' re ok , boss .
.. the violence has now found its way into the heart of new york city ... the death toll is 1 7 , with scores injured ...
the obvious speculation about al qaeda ... .. widely seen as the probable successor to edmond zuwanie ... tunnels and bridges will close for at least 1 2 hours ... .. alleged terrorist attack by ajene xola ... ..
zuwanie is still planning to address the general assembly of the un .
what were you doing on that bus ?
thank you for bringing me home .
hey !
l lost a man today .
a kid .
how do you know kuman ?
i never met him before .
you think that not getting caught in a lie is the same as the truth !
l' m not lying .
i went to him for help .
with what ?
l can' t tell you .
someone might get hurt .
" someone might get hurt . " there' s a bus full of dead people !
" someone might get hurt " ?
who ?
someone you know ?
someone who' s mixed up in all this ?
you ?
why did you leave africa ?
l told you .
no , you didn' t .
why did you come here ?
stop it .
goddammit !
stop shouting at me !
stop lying !
l' m not lying !
stop lying !
l was just on that bus !
i can' t think with all this noise .
i can' t !
you have to stop !
that isn' t me .
don' t be ridiculous .
lt isn' t me .
no , that is you .
and i know , because i drive you home , and i look at you through the binoculars , and everything else that i shouldn' t do .
lt was once .
lt' s not any more .
after the rallies , after my parents and sister were killed ,  then the rifles came out .
lt was the only way to get anyone to listen .
just to listen .
l killed a boy who had nothing to live for beyond the money he' d get for killing me .
l shot him in the head so he wouldn' t shoot me .
then i handed the rifle to my brother and told him , " i' m through . " ...  l walked away with him shouting at me , " you' re a coward . " ...  " our parents are dead , zuwanie' s alive .
my brother , who in another life wouldn' t harm a ...
that was the last thing he ever said to me .
the only contact i have is the notebooks i send and imagine him receiving .
l know he' s alive .
i know it .
but i' m not to him .
l lied to you because i was afraid .
l was afraid he might be involved in what i heard .
l lied to everyone else so they' d let me near the un ,  and that' s the only place that i believe has a chance to change any of this .
and i lied to you about ajene xola because ...  l loved him .
once .
until the colour of my skin became a problem .
the politics of my skin .
l walked away from africa with nothing .
no brother , no family , no lover , nothing .
just a belief that words and compassion are the better way .
even if it' s slower than a gun .
where are you going ?
you' ve got blood all over your face .
you can' t say stuff like that with blood on your face .
this is precisely why dr zuwanie must be allowed to speak .
this monstrous act of terrorism was aimed at you ...  .. and at the heart of the united nations .
l can' t listen to this .
do not allow them to intimidate you ...  .. or dr zuwanie .
l' m not at liberty to tell you .
where we going ?
bathroom .
keller .
get this processed and back to me right away .
did he leave a note ?
did you read it ?
of course you did .
would you read it to me , please ?
" dear silvia , i came to tell you something and then didn' t . " ...
" i wanted to , but when i saw you i couldn' t find the words . " ...  " i told you i didn' t know where simon is .
that was a lie . " ...  " he was there that day .
a young boy shot him . " ...
" i couldn' t tell you .
i' m a coward .
simon was braver than me . " ...  " you' re braver than me .
i' m so sorry . " ...  l' m so sorry .
the second time was me .
l feel like my friends must feel when they try to say something .
lt' s all right .
that' s what i say to them .
he left this with the note .
the only thing that i wanted ...
.. besides having her back ...  was to be left alone .
my bonnie lies over the ocean ...
don' t cry .
don' t cry .
i' m not crying .
you don' t have to cry .
i' m not .
because i' m here , and i won' t leave .
i promise .
look at me .

the assembly will first hear an address by the president of the republic of matobo .
on behalf of the general assembly ,  l have the honour to welcome to the united nations  his excellency dr edmond zuwanie , president of the republic of matobo ,  and to invite him to address the assembly .
mr president , mr secretary general .
today my beloved country is under siege .
as you saw the other afternoon across the river in brooklyn ,  the terrorists in my country will stop at nothing .
how am i to defend my country against enemies like these ?
l admit i have dealt harshly with terrorists ...
tobin , it' s king .
.. as we all will have to .
i don' t think matu' s here .
remember the profile of suicide bombers and how there isn' t one ?
.. who know the evil and violence of real terrorism ...  your mother and sister will get their cheque on monday .
this isn' t his apartment .
you did well .
no one here will live long .
it' s an alds hospice .
.. with a reciprocal and immediate violence ...
my opinion ?
it' s a con .
l have been forced to do this .
lt is the hope and specific goal of my administration ...  to reform these brutal methods ...
get him off the podium .
to participate in the formation ...
we' ve got to go .
but i want to speak !
come on , sir , run !
he' s ok .
cover here .
i' il take the hall .
where' s keller ?

lncredible .

holster your weapon .
dr zuwanie .
l remember the last time you were here .
use the 42nd street exit .
we almost had an assassination here .
please move ...  we watched you on the telly back home .
my family .
all the families .
you were like the beatles .
two or three more seconds , he would have assassinated him .
an almost assassinated leader gets so much credibility ...  so he can stay in power and gets to stick around to enjoy it .
we were so proud of you .
there you were , speaking to the world .
l don' t think you should touch ...
because i' m not wearing a glove ?
what is your name , child ?
l' m the silvia whose family you killed .
what' s in your hand ?
it' s ...
just a precaution .
what' s in your hand ?
he must' ve been very surprised .
he thought it was a live round .
where is everyone ?
but you knew better .
give me the live round .
l grew up seeing you with this gun .
it' s the gun you saved our country with .
drop the gun !
put it down !
keller , us secret service .
lt' s the same one you used to kill it .
he' s got a glock on his hip .
code 1 00 in the sound room .
look at it .
look at it !
careful .
the bleeder had alds .
there' s no way you can prove this .
you' il cop a plea .
you' re just an employee , right ?
he' s in custody .
they' re bringing him down .
swat team' s at 42nd street .
are you all right ?
yeah .
where' s zuwanie ?
the safe room .
what happened ?
it was a fake .
a piece of theatre to justify the killing .
ethnic cleansing , genocide .
you there ?
that' s the flight .
she' s not on it .
l checked every hotel in new york , her friends .
they don' t know where she' d go .
no one knows her .
l know her .
ok , where is she ?
she said she was going home .
i' m going home ...  what home ?
how' d you happen to be there after hours ?
an evacuation .
i left some things .
lt takes too long ...
i wouldn' t mind if he were gone .
she' s here .
she' s been in that room all night .
how could someone so good , so ...
how could you give us so much ,
so much ...
then take away more ?

yeah .
keep everybody out .
silvia ?
silvia ?
lt' s me .
l' m coming in alone .
i' m coming in .

lt was all just theatre , an almost assassination ...  meant to justify his acts .
we' ve got all we need to prosecute .
i have him .
he' il die in prison .
i want him to die how simon died .
that' il be over in two seconds , and you' il have all your years .
sir , it' s a lot worse than you think .
your so called assassin is dead .
your head of security is making a deal .
we have lud and the rifle .
you' il be tried before two courts .
he' s been tried !
sir , you' re finished .
lt doesn' t matter !
silvia .
listen to me .
l told you i' d let him drown .
the man who drove my wife into a bridge abutment .
but i wouldn' t .
then you' d be wrong .
no , i wouldn' t be wrong .
i don' t want to spend the rest of my life in mourning .
you have to get out of here .
l can' t do that .
so put the gun down .
l can' t .
yes , you can .
put it down .
l can' t !
i can' t ...
i can' t .
just go .
this is how it' s done .
this is how you put a gun down .
please .
you shoot him , he' il be dead ...
.. but then you' il be dead ...
.. and i don' t know what i' il be .
put it down .

" the gunfire around us ... " louder .
like when you wrote it .
when you believed it .
when you meant it .
" the gunfire around us makes it hard to hear . " ...

" it can be heard ...
" it can be heard over ...  over noises that bury everything else . " " even ...
" even ...
" even when it' s not shouting . " ...  " shouting . " " even when it ...  " even if it' s just a whisper . " ...
