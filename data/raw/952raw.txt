constable , calm down .
where are the rest of the police ?
they ' re on patrol .
they ' re all dead , eaten alive .
i ' ve never seen anything like this .
i have .
what the hell is happening here ?
it ' s an invasion .
you have to be fuckin ' kiddin ' me .
the end of life as we know it .
we are the chosen ones .
the ones who will stand and fight .
it ' s getting better , you' ve got shits for brains .
you ' re a fuckin ' loonie !
you have all been sent to me ... ... for a reason .
will you just shut your fuckin ' mouth ?
you dead shit fuckin ' monkey bag fucker !
these things are brain eating zombies .
there' s no such things as zombies .
so how does it feel , rene ?
how does it feel to be trapped in this town with the rest of us ?
just leave me alone .
you don ' t even look at me when i speak to you .
that title was mine again .
i won that competition fair and square .
roping two pigs together isn' t a talent fit for winning miss catch of the day .
no bloody way !
she looked alright , though , in that outfit she was wearing .
maybe i don' t look as good as you in a bikini right now ... with wayne junior on the way , but ... but i' ve got asinging voice like an angel and if you hadn ' t cheated ...
come on , sallyanne , i was broke !
that was the only reason i entered . ... and forget all about your duties as queen .
you are to preserve the best interest of the town .
that ' s your no 1 priority .
ladies , you need to shut up with the girlie talk and calm down .
the situation is under control .
help will be here soon .
if you feel scared , just think of a happy place .
your folks ' farm always seemed to make you happy .
i ' m having a turd of a day .
remember when we were kids ... your dad used to swing us on that tyre he hung from that tree ?
we were happy then , there was room to swing ... but you couldn ' t swing a cat in here !
thanks , molly .
i don ' t get this , how do they know where we were ?
they can smell us .
great !
they want to feed off us .
we ' re like spam in a fuckin ' can ...
good job !
are we safe in here ?
no food , too many people .
and water , where ' s your taps ?
no taps down here .
the bottled water is upstairs .
you don ' t want to drink the tap water .
why ?
tap water is tank water ... tank water is rain water , the rain is all part of this attack .
what ?
and there was this light coming down from the clouds ... and it was sucking up bugs and stuff .
well that explains it , a light coming down sucking up bugs .
bullshit !
well , people hallucinate some times when they panic , i know i do .
it ' s probably just the sunlight coming through the clouds .
that' s what it was .
that was no sunlight .
and the meteorites falling ?
i saw that .
the whole town saw that .
well , i am no weather girl ... but i am sure this kind of thing happens all the time .
you' re a fisherman .
we used to sell these in my store .
damn things sold better than the guns ever did .
it brings me good luck .
and you call this good luck ?
i' m still breathing .
she' s one of them !
no , she' s having a baby !
what baby ?
get me to the hospital .
we have to leave .
no one leaves until i say so .
we have to get her out of here .
we ' ve got two cops here .
they know how to deliver a baby .
that ' s right , we do .
there you go .
i ' m sure you do , molly .
see if the cervix is dilated and , sergeant , you mop up her water .
we ' re out of here !
molly , get her ready now , do it now !
alright , we ' re leaving , let ' s go .
we must prepare .
they ' re leaving .
they ' il die , we must stick together .
we have to take her to the hospital .
that ' s a girl .
i ' m staying here .
we ' re leaving .
come , slowly .
come on !
come on !
we gotta get her going !
god !
let ' s get out of here !
you gotta be fuckin ' kiddin ' me , pal !
put it down !
put the bag down , get your hands away !
get your hands away .
get up , up , up !
where is the car ?
garage .
how do we get there ?
through the kitchen .
where are the car keys ?
ln the hallway .
can we get to them easily ?
depends on what ' s still up there .
remember , i ' m in charge .

they ' re all gone .
bingo !
the contractions have stopped .
fuck a dead duck , you little fuckin ' ... fuck !

nobody goes down until i' ve checked it out .
on your bike , constable .
go on , get down .
what is it , constable ?
what is it , constable ?
it' s clear !
come on down .
are you okay ?
are you sure ?
shift your arse , pal , i ' m driving this shitbox .
nobody is driving this shitbox but me .

it ' s too far .
i don ' t want to go back into town .
hurry up !
let' s go !
what are you waiting for ?
what are you waiting for ?
just get us out of here !
we ' re nearly out of berkeley now .
shift your arse , princess .
i ' m watching you .
i feel like i ' m going to throw up .
me too .
my god .
this can ' t be real .
it ' s metal .
you know , i don ' t get this .
it takes the council 2 years to fix a pothole in front of my place ... yet they can knock this up in a couple of days .
this ain ' t no council job , waynie .
maybe those things built it .
no .
what do you reckon built it then ?
i ' ve never seen anything like this before .
i saw a pineapple twice the size of awatermelon , but nothing like this .
aliens .
here we go again with your crazy arse alien story .
the whole town ... ... is sick of it !
they ' re not aliens ... they ' re zomies , okay ?
happy ?
we should go back in the van .
that ' s really gonna help , wayne .
well , what do you reckon ?
we just gotta think calmly .
my god .
we ' re trapped .
we ' re all gonna die !
we ' re all gonna die !
nobody is dying today , not on my watch !
we ' re okay .
i ' m gonna fuckin ' climb it .
what ?
you don ' t even know how it is .
this is not in discussion !
no way are we going back .
maybe there ' s an opening further down .
we ' re all fenced in .
dead set ?
can i have a look ?
doesn ' t matter , i climb the poofter here .
sir , do you think that ' s such a good idea ?
you don ' t look real well .
who the fuck is in charge here ?
you don ' t know what ' s inside it .
and what about that help you said was coming ?
constable , collect all their weapons and hold on to them ... till my return .
good luck , mate .
i need you to relinquish your weapons .
jesus christ , you ' re taking your sweet time , aren ' t you ?
the storm .
it ' s gonna rain .
it ' s the rain .
i ' ve seen it .
sergeant !
sergeant !
it ' s gonna rain .
just get in the car .
come , molly , we have to get in the car .
babe , you ' re smoking !
pour this on me !
take it , take it , hon .
no , she is one of them !
we have to help him .
fuck him !
he ' s gone , let ' s go .
come on !
are you burnt ?
no , it doesn ' t burn , it ' s weird .
take it .
molly turned into one of those things .
you must have seen her .
who the hell is that ?
it' s another one of those zombies .
let ' s get out of here .
come on , let ' s go !
i wanna go !
hey , nutbag , drive .
i can ' t take this anymore , it ' s just one monster after another .
aliens , we must fight them .
like hell we must !
keep driving .
i just want to go home .
i ' m having a baby .
molly turned into one of those things .
what are you talking about ?
she was normal when i saw her .
look , i know what i saw .
fine , molly turned into a flying zombie , wonderful !
more importantly , what the hell was that thing back there ?
you reckon it was one of those aliens you have been talking about ?
can' t remember what they look like .
we ' re gonna die .
well , think , it could have been any poor bastard back there .
i just want my mum .
there' s gotta to be another way out .
damn , skippy , we ' re flying out .
what makes you think things are better over that wall ?
it couldn ' t be any worse .
listen to him ... if we go over the wall , we should go prepared .
what do you suggest ?
well , we need supplies and stuff ... ... we should stop in town first .
we should go straight to the airfield ... because those things could be everywhere .
no , no .
honey , she is right , we should go back into town .
this is crazy .
all right .
alright , take us into town .
maybe they all got out in time .
no , we left town long before anyone else .
right , get out .
just stay there .
can you see anyone ?
you want to get out of here , right ?
of course .
watch him , make sure he doesn ' t do anything stupid .
and we ' il go in there .
babe , give that gun to rene .
no way , i' m not giving it to her .
babe ...
give that gun to rene , i give you mine .
good girl .
alright , stick close to me .
let ' s shop .
it ' s warm .
tastes like camel piss .
ropingtwo pigs together isn' t a talent fit forwinning miss catch of the day !
you know , you act crazy .
i ' m just doing what i must do .
why do you believe you must do anything ?
you know why .
that alien story of yours .
yes , i was attacked .
i ' ve heard that story before .
no , you haven ' t .
i was almost eaten by their killer fish .
it all seems so crazy .
giant walls , acid rain , zombies .
crazy has definitely come to this town for avisit .
after the fish attack they abducted me .
i must have fought them off somehow ...
i can' t remember how , but they threw me back to earth .
not only did i survive the fish attack and the abduction ...
i walked away without ascratch .
it ' s a gift , a power i have .
i must use it to fight , but i can ' t do it alone .
there is no one left but us four .
jesus christ , babe , could you make any much fuckin ' noise ?
the other two are heading down the same track as the cops .
think about what you ' ve just seen .
i am not crazy , the strongest ones are always the last ones left . you have the same strength i have .
i don ' t feel strong , i feel sick again .
i think the infection is in the air now .
molly ?
but time is short , so you' d better ask yourself
are you a fighter , fish queen ?
or are you zombie food ?
i just want things to be back to normal again .
i want my farm back .
then take it back .
take the whole town back .
alright , let ' s go .
stop !
stop , save your bullets .
mate , where did you hide those ?
go , go !
come on , let ' s go .
come on !
get in , get in !
come on !
come on , come on , the loopy prick ' s gone .
get in !
come on .
god !
it ' s the rain , get your coat off .
rene , come on !
you stay here , alright ?
no , wayne , please don ' t go .
i ' il be back , alright ?
what are you doing ?
we need this stuff .
here , take this .
wayne !
come on !
come on !
who are you , what ' s going on ?
wayne !
come on !
shit !
molly ?
i ' m over the wall !
we have an explosion .
roger .
going to investigate .
send helpover here .
i ' ve found a body .
we need assisance , we need assisance !
over here !
there' s somebody over here !
we' ve found a body , looks like a police officer .
there' s nobody else ?
we ' ve found one victim ...
iooks like the pilot .
stay behind the barricades .
if you go through the barricade , you' il be shot .
if you go through the barricade you will be shot !
we will open fire !
the army is preventing anyone from entering or leaving ... the town of berkeley .
those who broke through the blockade this morning ... are now quarantined along with the rest of the town' s residents .
it is believed that fragments from the nierle comet ... created a meteor shower over the township .
no evidence of the alleged plague sweeping through the town ... has been reported since the departure of the alien craft .
at this point we can confirm that berkeley ... is the only community to be bombarded with these fragments .
it ' s a boy .
he ' s fine .
good .
i ' m sure wayne will be okay .
nurse , nurse !
i ' ve been shot .
someone shot me !
someone shot me !
someone shot me !
all those people ... they wouldn ' t have died if we didn' t shoot them .
i think you are forgetting the whole thing ... when they were trying to rip off our heads and suck out our brains .
your wounds from the fish attack that magically heeled ... the rain did that , didn' t it ?
aliens are the saviours , not us .
one day you ' re out on your boat , you get attacked by zombie fish .
they munch at your face ...
iike you are the main course at a crazy country boy buffet .
you walk away , tell the town your story ... they think you ' re mad , everyone thinks you ' re mad .
you think i ' m mad .
no , you ' re not mad .
it happens again ... this time it ' s not zombie fish , it ' s zombie berkeley .
but this time i ' m prepared .
i ' m ready to fight whatever they can throw at me .
still , i wasn ' t strong enough .
the strongest ones are always the last ones left .
if that ' s not me , it must be you .
i ' m just a fish queen , nothing more .
if that was the case , you wouldn ' t have battled the undead and lived .
you would have been the entree on asmorgasboard of brain food .
take care , marion .
brings me good luck .
you callthis good luck ?
the outbreak moved faster this time .
it spread so quickly , it couldn' t be stopped .
it spread beyond berkeley and across the country .
those that i could save from the medical centre are here now .
safe .
at least for the time being .
the last couple of months have been nothing but clear skies .
the aliens haven' t come back , maybe some daythey will .
until then , i must contain the infection .
sallyanne said that my first duty as catch of the day winner ... is to preserve the best interests of the town .
