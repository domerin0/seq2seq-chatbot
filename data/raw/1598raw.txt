now what do you gotta go and say that for ?
well , now or later ?
how could i misinterpret ?
no , bernie .
you didn' t send the wrong guy .
i' m handling things .
but i never signed up for that .
listen , i promise you , when i tell him it will make a difference .
bye .
hey , sweets .
i keep calling and , uh , i haven' t heard a word from you .
i' m starting to wonder .
i know you' re angry with me , but , uh , you know , " ain' t no sunshine when she' s gone .
okay ?
i think she actually went to vegas .
i keep telling you, jerry , these women are problems, you know .
you should try to be like me .
i answer to myself .
no hassles , nobody ridin ' my ass like a goddamn horse in a saddle .
free .
ted, you keep your self closed off ... so you have no shot at meeting the right woman .
any woman can be the right woman if the numbers work and you' re willing .
no way .
not me .
you settle . you open yourself up .
you become vulnerable .
what' s this sudden insight into my relationship ?
okay , look, jerry .
she is in vegas .
what ?
hey , shit falls down, you know ?
" shitfalls down .
margolese called nayman all pissed off ... that you were fucking this up , told him to put somebody on sam to keep an eye .
in case  " in case ?
in case i get any funny ideas . and you' re just telling me this now ?
don' t break my balls .
there' s other things to consider .
like what ?
like that gun is worth a lot of money .
people know you have it .
sam could be in danger .
no shit .
who did they put on her ?
you don' t know him , but it' s safe to say you know of him .
who ?
it' s that fucking psycho leroy from minnesota .
leroy !
nayman had to do it, jerry .
it was an order .
margolese would know if he didn' t .
wait .
they' re just trying to scare me .
well, that would sure do it for me .
we' ve all heard the kidney story, jerry .
nayman wants us on that 7 : 00 flight to vegas , pistol in tow , no ifs , ands or buts .
they' il meet us a tthe airport , and then this leroy guy will take the pistol to margolese .
yeah .

at first , i thought this guy is all right .
and then i' m thinking he' s more than all right , he' s terrific .
but there' s no way he' s gonna feel the same way about me .
then i find out he does .
then i' m thinking ... what happens when he finds out what i do ... and who i am and what i' ve done ?
so , who am i kidding , right ?
let' s get serious . what are you gonna do about it ?
sighs that' s the thing .
i didn' t have to do anything .
it happened absent of my will to consciously make it happen .
oh , really ?
i was a little drunk last night .
i took my gun and i put it up in the towels in the bathroom, you know .
and he found it .
and he said , " the past doesn' tmatter .
it' s the future that counts .
leroy .
see , life can change .
people can change .
i haven' t cried in 12 years .
what are you lookin ' at ?
don' t look at me like that .
you' re makin ' it worse . what are you , barbara walters ?
sniffles
it' s just beautiful .
let' s talk about somethin ' else .
what do you wanna talk about ?
anything . anything else .
anything . whatever .
what was it over , the last time you cried ?
let' s talk about that .
oh, yeah, that' il bring the sun right out .
ted i heard it was this guy leroy' s mother .
that' s what i heard .
okay, that' s what we call " bullshit .
if i told one guy at the next convention ... that you kept your mother cut up in the freezer for five years , you' d have a reputation too .
factor not , it makes no difference .
jesus, ted, you can' t be so naive , man .
the guy' s a star .
oh , mygod . what are you so worried about then if you think he' s all blow hard and bullshit ?
i met leroy once , in minnesota .
it was for all of two seconds .
i shook his hand .
he seemed like a nice enough guy .
whether or not he lives up to this pumped up legend of a psychotic is beside the point .
and if he does sit naked in his garage soaking in gasoline lighting matches , i don' t care .
what concerns me is he was hired in the first place . are you with me ?
geez, jerry, you really met him ?
oh , my god !
hey , old ted is not gonna let anything happen , okay, jerry ?
i' m here .
thanks , ted .
i feel perfectly safe .
hola .
i no fuck around .

jerry , i would never  go ahead , deny it .
go ahead .
go ahead !
okay , okay .
jerry, that' s what he said .
so you were lying to me when you said that i would walk away from this .
no, jerry, that' s what he said .
then you' re lying now about him telling to off me .
which is it ?
no , no .
nayman told me to do it, jerry , but
but ? but ?
but
but you' re just doing your portion .
isn' t that how it works, ted ?
seventeen portions left for boca boca raton .
right ?
i wouldn' t do that portion .
come on , i swear !
on one hand, they tell you to bring me in .
on the other hand , they tell you to take me out .
why are you being told two contradicting things ?
you don' t ask a question ?
i i just i i don' t know .
you don' t think that' s a little weird ?
yeah , it' s it' s weird .
right !
because something' s going on .
what is it ?
exactly . you don' t know , ' cause you' re just doing your fucking part .
well , i' m not going down because you don' t know !

you have no intention of giving the gun to margolese , do you , bernie ?
look , bobby . you know , i know that you' re loyal .
and that' s good .
i mean , nobody' s debating that .
let me ask you .
in your skulking around , going through private things in other people' s offices , did you manage to discover that he' s shutting us down ?
that' s right .
you , me , everybody .
i don' t i don' t understand .
you didn' t get the memo , the severance package, the bonus ?

let me help you get on the right side of the line ... and do for you what he should' ve done , bobby .
he' s changed in prison .

did he fucking touch you ? do you have any idea ... what i have been through these last few days , hmm ?
whatever you' ve been through , multiply it by a thousand times .
you' il have some vague conception of where i' m at .
oh , oh , oh !
isn' t that typical, jerry ?
it' s all a competition !
shh , shh .
titfortat, tatfortit !
stop yelling, for christ' s sake !
how are you ? are you okay ? are you all right ?
where are you ?
toluca airport, jerry .
and things are shitty really shitty !
tell him if he shows up with the pistol , everything will be all right .
he doesn' t care about that .
only cares about himself .
it' s the same thing with him .
why are you airing personal matters with complete strangers ?
oh , let me see .
uh , i don' t think that you really classify ... someone who you just perpetrated a killing with a complete fucking stranger !
and let me tell you something .
i can' t find my kotex cards ...
or mycredit pads !
sam, what did you say ?
all right, jerry, just settle down .
hey ! what' d you do to her ?
jerry, just settle down .
okay ?
yeah .
we had a slight situation , but it should occur to you ... that i' m a professional and i know what i' m doing .
so why don' t we all just chill out a minute here ?
woman speaking overp . a. ]
now first of all, what happened ?
did you get lost ?
yeah, five fucking years ago .
what did you i can' t hear you .
no , nothing .
nothing .

i understand .
i understand .
huh ?
justcome down here , pick us up .
we' il square things away .
you got a very special woman here, jerry .
but we all know how you can get , right ?
chuckles
so , let' s not have any of that .
what ?
this is a time for selflessness .
what ? wha  dial tone humming
you all right ?
stupid gun .
out !
leroy i have to ask you a question .
and it' s an important one , so ...
i want you to think about the answer before you give it to me , okay ?
okay .
when two people love each other , really love each other , but they just can' t get it together , when do you get to that point where enough is enough ?
that oh, well, that' s you know .
um, you know it' s over when
okay , i have , like , these psychosomatic ... insomniatic manifestations of
uh well , here' s the thing about me .
i' m a product of my emotions versus being a product ofmyenvironment , like him , which he is , exactly , just that environmental
i i need sunshine to grow .
that' s who i am .
and with the projection of
i have goals .
that' s your answer ?
yeah .
that' s not right .
i mean, there' s a right answer here , but that' s not it .
scoffs
look .
in my business , you' re surrounded ... by loneliness and finality .
now , i don' t care what your take is on an afterlife .
when people die , it' s scary .
and they go alone .
now, the people that i send off ... that have experienced love , they' re a little less scared .
i mean, they' re still scared , but there' s ... a calmness to ' em .
and i think that comes from the knowledge that somebody somewhere loved them ... and cared for' em and will miss ' em .
now , i see that from time to time , and i am awed by it .
i don' t think i' d be telling you any of this if it wasn' t for frank .
anyway , it' s it' s a loaded question .
look, when two people love each other ,
totally, truthfully , all the way love each other , mm hmm . the answer to that question is simple , especially in your case .
when do you get to that point where enough is enough ?
never .
never .
i just hope jerry' s not stupid .
what is he driving ?
it' s a funky rental .
look , i know we' re all a little grouchy right now .
we' il get something to eat , you' il get the pistol and then we' il all go our separate ways .
really separate ways .
now , don' t start , sam .
you know what .
shut up .
i' il start because i have the right .
why do you do that ?
do not tell me to shut up .
i count here, jerry .
we had an agreement , remember ?
shut up .
why don' twe all shut up a little bit ?
i swear to god , i will crash this fucking car right now .
jerry , don' t do that .
i will .
one more word out of you . another word , sam .
one more word .

when do you get to that point of enough is enough ?
never .
bleating
they' il call .
i' ve left 60 messages .
i said it was an emergency .
why would nayman ask you if you like sex and travel ?
i mean, w w what is it even supposed to mean ?
that you fool around or something ?
is that is that
i tell you this whole , long debacle , and this you have a problem with ?
yeah . yeah , i do , because i think tha twhen you ask someone ...

so done with the running .
just the packing and the running and the
sooner or later , that phone is gonna ring .
we are going to get your passport in order ... and you are gonna put that gun in margolese' s hand where it belongs .

whispering in spanish
mr. margolese .

what' s it gonna take for you to give it to me and not to another ?

stammers who the fuck are these guys ?
they work for this man , tropillo .
and who the fuck is tropi you know what ? not even important .
you give me one good reason why i shouldn' t fight to my death to not give you the gun .
believe you me , if it comes to that , someone here' s gonna leave this room missing an ear ... or not being able to fuck anymore .
one reason , now that you let me know what you think i' m made of .
chuckling are you a fatalist, jerry ?
uh , i never really thoughtabout it .
por favor .
gracias .
when you do think about it , about that afternoon that you smashed into my life , into my car , ever think there' s anything to that ?
i honestly never thought about it .
because of that afternoon , i' m doomed to remember ... a simple backwards inmate with a paperclipping .
when you' re in jail , a small box , you learn a lot about the fella you' re in a cage with .
i grew to love that boy , like he was my own son .
but he was his .
one day the boy came to me with a paperclipping .
this is my destiny .
this is my birthright .
it was a story about the pistol how they found it in the mines stashed away .
when i asked why it meant so much to him , the story he told changed my life .
spanish ]
tropillo' s son' s voice ]
the night before the nobleman' s arrival , the assistant could not sleep , his heart in a chingpain .
shouting in spanish
the day was upon him when the gunsmith would present ... his gift to the nobleman and his son .
the nobleman' s son was anotoriously vicious soldier , worldly and wicked .
for him , his father demanded something more beautiful , more perfect than he' d ever laid eyes on before .
but nothing , no words or description could have given just ice to it ... or have prepared him for that gun' s flawless grace .
when thenobleman' s son saw his intended bride to be , it was love at first sight .
the nobleman' s son took the mighty weapon into his hands .
a perfect fit .
it did not work .
the nobleman took it as a bad omen .
the curse had rendered it useless in unworthy hands .
the gunsmith urged him to try it one last time , and so he did .
the nobleman was insulted by the ineptness , angry with the poor gunsmith .
the yargued .
when the nobleman' s son realized that her heart belonged to the poor , simple assistant , a man far less than he , he was furious in anger .
he could not have that .
the assistant , realizing that even if the gun should work , she would certainly die next , begged his love to withdraw and accept their fate .
no audible dialogue
some say you could actually hear her heart break .
she fearlessly surrendered her bitter spirit unto purgatory .
church bells ringing ]
the pistol contains her damned soul .
margolese day afterday i would listen to that story .
and always he would tell me , " when i get out ,
i will find that pistol and i will return it to my father , whose father' s father had crafted the gun .
eighteen months later , he took it in the belly for me .
he died .
i vowed to search , acquire the pistol and return it to his father .
my grandson beck , headstrong boy .
sure , he was mixed up .
he didn' t understand the honor ... behind what i was doing .
that' s when it became clear to me i had to send you down here .
because you were the instrument in the situation, jerry .
his son is dead .
my grandson is dead .
all of it brought together by that afternoon at our intersection .
well, that that' s a ... pretty good fucking reason .
you are a soldier of god .
speaking spanish ]
she will be safe there , right there , and she can fly with the angels .
no devils can catch her here , righ there , and now she will be able tofly with the angels .
