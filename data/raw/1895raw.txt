# on white horses let me ride away
# to my world of dreams so far away
# let me run
# to the sun
# to a world my heart can understand
# it' s a gentle , warm and wonderland
# far away
# stars away
# where the clouds are made of candyfloss
# as the day is born
# when the stars are gone
# we' il race to meet the dawn
# so , when i can only see the grey
# of a sad and very lonely day
# that' s when i
# softly sigh
# on white horses , snowy white horses , let me ride away
take a step forward .
and another one .
and another .

why should we be subjected to their mother fixated outpourings ? " you ask .
we get enough of that from our boyfriends .
remember , it' s just as relevant to talk about lou reed or ... adam ant in your essay .
precisely what barthes was saying in the ' 50s , and what baudrillard is saying now .
so , questions ?
yes ?
the young lady in the green sweater .
oh .
yes , erm ...
do you think a deconstructive approach to literary criticism
leads to a cooler , less emotional response from the reader ?
that' s an interesting one .
that is the question .
what' s your name ?
holly rossman .
holly , holly .
very good .
you see , the thing about critical theory that is important ... holly ... holly rossman .
shh .
socialist worker !
holly ...
stuart , not now .
we' ve got to discuss some work with our tutor .
i' il phone you .
holly , come on !
socialist worker !
i was just kidding about adam ant , right ?
don' t do that to me !
but it is so important to have a visceral reaction to the text .
but that' s so reductive .
oh , absolutely .
it' s not .
it' s the emotion expressed that matters .
do you know tarkovsky ?
it' s like tarkovsky .
oh , i love tarkovsky .
do you ?
oh , he' s my favourite director .
tarkovsky and bergman .
i' m reading bergman' s autobiography now .

he loved it .
i always wonder what people like that are really like , underneath all that crap .
and did you see his shoes ?
loafers with yellow socks !
yellow socks !
i know .
it' s better than a beret , though .
wooh !
oi , fuck off !
holly !
ben , do you believe in life after death ?
don' t you ever want to think about something serious ?
no .
no , i ... just want to be unconscious .

the bit about desire and metaphor with the integration of ...
do you want to get a cup of coffee ?
oh , ok .
great .
you got that ?
oh , yeah .
god , i used to pretend i was catholic .
i thought it made me seem more ... alluring .
do you think being jewish makes you more neurotic ?
not at all .
i was never interested in jewish girls when i was in school .
i' d go crazy for these ... rejecting brnnnhilde types .
still do , in fact .
now , would you say that was neurotic ?
yes !
erm ...
you know , it' d be really helpful if i could ... er ... just meet once more to show you a rough draft , before i ...
ok . .. hand it in .
er ... want to come by for tea on sunday ?
ok .
erm ... great .
thanks .
er ... my bag .
oh .
er ... see you later .
can you imagine how some people sleep with tutors ?
how desperate can you get ?
someone like you would do that .
the thing about blokes is , don' t ever be yourself .
you' ve got to have a gimmick , like " intense and difficult " .
you could do that easily .
oh , thanks !
shall i come out with you and ben ?
you know , you look a bit peaky , actually .
do i ?
mm .
why don' t you stay in bed ?
tuck up with a book ?
i' il see you later .

it' s the connection of desire to reality that possesses revolutionary force .
don' t you think so , daniel ?
body talk
# morning , afternoon and night
# we' re laying together , side by side
# searching for lust , searching for breath
# searching for the touch of life
# no words are spoken
# the only sound in here is ...
hey .
mm .
oh ...
jesus .
i' m wrecked .
when i was a child , i used to go in and watch my parents sleeping , when they were together .
they' re not together any more .
i can' t imagine you ever being a child .
you know , marina ...
i' m going to have to be careful .
if this gets out , you could be in a lot of trouble .
i won' t tell a soul , i promise .
clandestine' s my favourite word .
all right .
what' s your favourite word ?
sleep .
i' m an old man , you know .
no , you' re not .
no ?
you weren' t an old man last night .
ah , well , that was last night .
mmm ... ok .
ohh !
what ?
oh , jesus .
that coke was amazing .
just need a little sleep .
just a little bit of sleep .
i' il call you .
i' il call you later .
hi .
come back to me in dreams , that i may give , pulse for pulse , breath for breath .
speak low .
lean low .
as long ago , my love .
long ago .
i always loved that stanza when i was young .
mm .
do you ever feel excluded from rossetti' s mysticism , being jewish ?
oh , that' s right .
you wanted to be catholic , didn' t you ?
well ...
i think you' re very interesting , and very jewish , and both are possible .
holly , i don' t think this is a good idea .
no .
no , i know .
no , i' m sorry .
don' t be upset .
please don' t ... don' t be upset .
no , please , don' t ...
it' s ok .
all right .
selfish , shallow bitch !
you' re about as deep as a fucking coma victim !
you ... you' re gonna die a vacuous old slut !
and you can keep your crap paintings , cos they' re crap !
it' s better than dynasty .
fuck off !
do you think i' m shallow ?
course not .
just cos i don' t read fucking books .
doesn' t mean you' re not soulful .
oh , soulful like holly ...
who mentioned holly ? .. who' s sensitive and committed to causes ?
she' s a really scared person .
and she thinks too much .
i mean , you can' t experience things by reading about them in novels .
you know , we' ve got to really be careful .
i know .
i won' t say a word .
that is ... if you want to see me again .
hey ... of course i want to see you again .
god , you look so beautiful ... and strange .
i' m so glad you dumped stuart , holl .
he was always weird .
do you feel guilty about ben ?
erm ... yeah , a bit , i suppose .
maybe you' re right .
maybe we should all have one person .
like a real soul mate .
marina ?
what ?
nothing .
you always do that .
no , it' s nothing .
i' il tell you another time .
tell me
you' re so annoying .
let' s go for tea or a nice long walk .
mm ?
i thought coke and speed were more your style .
well , you obviously don' t know me very well , do you ?
you think i' m shallow , don' t you ?
my friend , marina , i' ve known her since we were ten .
she just never changes or wants me to change .
i used to be so in love with her brother nat .
talk about romantic projections .
christ !
i' d just melt when he came into the room .
actually , i probably still am , in that yearning , proustian way ...
jesus , holly !
do you ever stop talking ?
daniel ...

hm ?
you could just pull up my skirt and throw me down in these muddy leaves ...
holly !
holly !

nothing is the matter .
will you stop asking me what the matter is ?
i just ... i don' t feel like fucking in a crummy , wet wood .

i mean , that' s ridiculous .
marina , what we had was sex .
listen .
fuck off !
just fuck off !
shall i read you a soothing story ?
crime and punishment .
perfect .
raskolnikov pulled the axe quite out , swung it with both arms , and scarcely ... scarcely conscious of himself ... .. and almost without effort , almost mechanically , brought the blunt side down on her head .
he seemed not to use his own strength in this .
as soon as he had once brought the axe down , his strength returned to him .
hello .
you' ve still got your hat on .
hey .
where are you going ?
it feels weird .
yeah , i know .

he' s obviously a wanker .

i just ...
i just can' t believe it !
she must just hate me .
shh .
she didn' t even want him until i did .
i just can' t believe it !
she always does this to me .
oh , god .

nice to meet you .
you too .

no , no .
i have an audition in paris on monday .
i shouldn' t say this , but with a very brilliant , very known italian director .
bertolucci , actually .
that' s great .
yeah .
acting for cinema is not like theatre .
in the cinema , you must feel it .
not show emotion , just feel it .
and the camera sees it .
it' s really wonderful .
which films have you done ?
oh , mostly theatre at the moment .
is it nearly midnight ?
holly ...
yeah ?
oh .

isabel and i have got something to say .
we' re getting married .
ohhh !
lucky devil !
felicitations , isabel !
holly , are you all right ?

i think a great deal of champagne is called for here .
here .
it' s bloody freezing .
put this on .
i' m fine , marina .
god , she' s a nightmare , isn' t she ?
married ?
god .
i mean , who gets married ?
that' s something out of the dark ages .
it' s embarrassing .
it' s pathetic .
i know .
it' s weird .
and she' s hilarious !
oh , god , how can he ?
it' s such a fucking clich .
you' ve still got me .
why ?
who haven' t i got ?
holly , don' t be like that .
i can' t bear it when we' re not us .
i don' t know who i am when we' re not us .
i don' t know ever .
come on .

it' s nearly time !
oh , it' s that time .
happy new year , holl .
you too .
come on .
let' s go in .
come on .
smile .
come on . .. three , two , one !
happy new year !
i don' t get it
# breaking away to the other side
# i wanna make sense of why we live and die

this career chitchat makes me feel a failure .
tell me about it .
it used to be hip to be on the dole .
i know !
what' s happened ?
i' m still waiting to transmute into a successful adult , instead of being a 12 year old .
i remember that 12 year old .
can i read your book , holl ?
really ?
no , no .
you' d ...
actually , would you ?

she does it to me , too .
how does she do that ?
well ... i think you know one way , holly .
he' s not a hopeless twat , actually .

you don' t have to make it into a big deal .
we were having a nice time , until you spoilt it .
why do you hate people being happy ?
i don' t .
you' re just like your mother .
what do you mean ?
just because things haven' t worked out for you .
leave nat alone when he' s contented .
nat ?
what has nat got to do with it ?
he' s happy , and so am i.
i' m sorry you can' t be pleased for us .

white horses
# on white horses let me ride away
# to my world of dreams so far away
# let me run
# to the sun
# to a world my heart can understand
# it' s a gentle , warm and wonderland
# far away
# stars away
# where the clouds are made of candyfloss
# as the day is born
# when the stars are gone
# we' il race to meet the dawn
# so , when i can only see the grey
# of a sad and very lonely day
# that' s when i
# softly sigh
# on white horses , snowy white horses , let me ride away
drawing rings around the world
# you expose the film in me
# we' re drawing rings around the world
# sooner or later we will melt together
# and draw rings around the world
# with all those meteoric stones
# and all those sheep they never cloned
# ok
# i am glowing radioactive
# we draw rings around the world
# wish you could see us when we' re at our best
# now we draw rings around the world
# with cans of post water in tow
# we' re gonna vaporise your soul
# earth will become saturn ii
# with all those rings around the world
# tetsuo ii became me and you
# with all those rings around the world
# and all those body hammer blows
# drawing rings around the world
# ah ha
# ring ring , ring ring
# rings around the world
# ring ring , ring ring ...
