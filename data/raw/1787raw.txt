the latest ceasefire came too late to save these villages ...
today president clinton voiced concerns at the deteriorating situation in sarajevo ...
when people ask me , good listeners , why do i hate all the tutsi ,
i say , " read our history .
the tutsi were collaborators for the belgian colonists .
they stole our hutu land , they whipped us .
now they have come back , these tutsi rebels .
they are cockroaches .
they are murderers .
rwanda is our hutu land .
we are the majority .
they are a minority of traitors and invaders .
we will squash the infestation .
we will wipe out the rpf rebels .
this is rtlm , hutu power radio .
stay alert .
watch your neighbors .

on the street ,
i' il go see what' s happening , it' s all right ,
we know you are tutsi , please , sir , this is my husband ,
he' s kust a gardener , he' s been spying for the rebels ,

we must do something ,
please help him !
oh , victor !
victor !
there is nothing we can do ,
you must stay the night , thomas , yes ,
no !
why would they arrest victor ?
he has no politics ,
he' s a gardener , who knows , tatsi ?
who knows ?
someone who didn' t like him denounced him as a rebel spy ,
happens all the time now ,
maybe you could call one of your contacts in the army ,
it wouldn' t help ,
you could ask as a favor ,
no , i could not ,
tatsi , all day long i work to please this officer , that diplomat , some tourist , to store up favors so if there is a time when we need help ,
i have powerful people i can call upon ,
but victor was a good neighbor ,
he is not family , family is all that matters ,
please , please , leave these things to my good kudgment ,
this assignment is bullshit ,
come on , a few days in a nice hotel , no one shooting at us ?
gentlemen , welcome
i am paul rusesabagina , the house manager ,
how you doing ?
nice to meet you ,
anything that you need , please find me ,
thank you , certainly ,
so , what is the actual difference
according to the belgian colonists , the tutsis are taller and more elegant ,
it was the belgians that created the division ,
how ?
they picked people , those with thinner noses , lighter skin ,
they used to measure the width of people' s noses ,
the belgians used the tutsis to run the country ,
then when they left , they left the power to the hutus , and of course the hutus took revenge on the elite tutsis for years of repression ,
am i telling the truth , paul ?
yes , unfortunately , please take this to the general ,
benedict is our finest kournalist in kigali , an expert on the subkect ,
so what are you , paul ?
i am hutu ,
gentlemen ,
more champagne ?
more champagne would be nice ,
excuse me , honey , can i ask you a personal question ?
are you a hutu or a tutsi ?
i am tutsi ,
and your friend ?
tutsi ?
no , i am hutu ,
they could be twins ,
get the camera , the general' s going to give us an interview ,
okay ,
i' m in room 22 , i' d love to finish up this conversation ,
senior u. n. officers claim that the rwandan army is secretly training and arming the hutu militia called the interhamwe .
i put this claim to the head of the armed forces , general bizimungu .
no .
no , we have not been training the militia .
the u. n. are mistaken in this accusation .
do you support your president' s agreement to make peace with the rebels ?
the president has the full support of the army .
that peace agreement will be signed today in tanzania between tutsi rebel forces and president habyarimana .
this is a great day for rwanda and for all of africa ,
negotiation has replaced confrontation ,,,
paul , have a drink ,
friendship has replaced fear ,
ladies and gentlemen , we have a live feed to the signing of the peace agreement ,
to our president , may he find peace ,
may we all find peace ,
let us all dedicate ourselves to nurturing this hard earned accord ,
to peace !
peace !
look me up if you come over , yes , it is a beautiful city ,
i am planning on returning there as forgive me ,
thank you , bye , thomas ,
hello , fedens ,
well , this is a surprise ,
forgive us , paul , we must talk ,
yes , what' s wrong ?
i have it from a very reliable source , paul ,
who ?
thank you , sullivan ,
my assistant , the hutu power man ,
he says that we must get out now , that soon it' il be very bad ,
give me this man' s name ,
please , paul , even though he is lnterhamwe , he' s a friend ,
he wants your kob , thomas ,
he said that there is a signal ,
it is " cut the tall trees ,
and when they hear this signal , the militia are to go to war ,
paul , please , let us take tatiana with us ,
you are hutu , you will be safe ,
fedens , i know you have heard many things ,
and i know what we have seen , thomas ,
but please , the united nations are here now ,
the world press are watching ,
the peace has been signed , let this process work
what was that ?
power cuts ,

the mille collines is an oasis of calm for all our loyal customers ,

i got through to the french president' s office ,
well , thank you , you have saved our lives ,
i pleaded with the french and the belgians to go back and get you all ,
i am afraid this is not going to happen .
they' re cowards , paul ,
rwanda is not worth a single vote to any of them ,
the french , the british ,
i am sorry , paul ,
thank you ,

we can only save ourselves ,
many of you know influential people abroad ,
you must call these people ,

you must tell them what will happen to us ,
say good bye ,
but when you say good bye , say it as though you are reaching through the phone and holding their hand ,
let them know that if they let go of that hand ,,, ,,, you will die ,
we must shame them into sending help ,
most importantly , this cannot be a refugee camp ,

we have every reason to believe that acts of genocide have occurred .
how many acts of genocide does it take to make genocide ?
alan , that' s just not a question that i' m in a position to answer .
is it true that you have specific guidance not to use the word " genocide " in isolation , but always to preface it with this word " acts of " ?

i have
there are formulations that we are using that we are trying to be consistent in our use of
i' m sorry it is not glenmorangie ,
as long as it is scotch ,
your white friends have abandoned you ,
so it would seem , well , don' t worry ,
i will take care of you , i' m glad to hear that because i was wondering if perhaps you could spare us a few policemen ,
to protect us , sir ,
the police are very busy , paul , yes , i' m aware of this ,
but when i last spoke to the president of sabena , he assured me that anyone who helped protect belgian property would be well rewarded ,
i will see what i can do ,
excuse me momentarily , sir ,
where has all our beer gone ?

i overheard something that i think you should know about ,
what did you overhear ?
it was a discussion between a u, n , colonel and an american embassy official ,

to george rutaganda' s place ,
no , no , no ,
i have to , tatiana ,
we are only as valuable as the money we give to him ,
you cannot go alone ,
i' m not going alone , i' il take gregoire with me ,
he' s a good hutu , and he wants to impress me now ,
it is good to see you back at work , gregoire ,
please , sir , accept my humblest apologies , please , please ,
we have a kob this morning ,
we are going to see george rutaganda ,
please get the van ,
show me your l, d ,
remember how those tutsi women used to look down their long noses at hutu men ?
now they beg for their lives .
i' m here to see my friend george rutaganda ,
i say taste those tutsi whores before they die .
then they' il know what hutu power is , my warriors .
remember , one cockroach can start an infestation .
we need to exterminate these vermin .

tutsi prostitutes and witches , so , what can i do for you ?
i need supplies , george , anytime ,
paul , everything is double the price now , you understand that ?
yes , i need rice , beans , powdered milk , beer , and your best whiskey ,
beer yes , but whiskey no ,
you have no whiskey ?
no whiskey , no spirits ,
your ,,, rich guests will have to do without their scotch ,

what are you saying , george ?
your rich cockroaches at the hotel ,

you do not honestly believe that you can kill them all ?

ten bags of beans , come , quick ,
and put those in the van , you ,
let me give you a little tip , my friend ,
our generals in army say , " don' t go near the mille collines or they will send the belgian soldiers back here ,
but soon those generals will have gone and we will be in charge ,
it' s time to butcher that fat cow of yours for the meat ,
let' s go ,
maybe you could help us , paul ,
you have some very important traitors at that hotel ,
now , if we were to get them , then maybe we would let you have one or two cockroaches of your own ,
do you understand ?
it is almost dawn , george ,
we really must be going ,
take the river road back , it' s clear ,
gregoire , what is going on now ?
you' ve driven off the road , no , i' m on the road ,
you' re going to put us in the river , stop the car , stop the car ,
