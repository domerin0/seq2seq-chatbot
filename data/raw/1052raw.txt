with this perfect female body .
uh huh .
but ...
what ?
what ?
i can' t say .
come on , man .
you can' t give a buildup like that and not deliver .
a perfect female body .
it' s not a bad start .
but the head of abraham lincoln .
aaah .
i mean , the hat and the beard .
oh , well .
best not think too deeply on this one , right ?
best not .
i gotta get some stuff from mr. birchfield .

gilligan' s transistor radio .

what about that one where that sexy surfer guy catches that huge wave ?
do you remember that ?
oh , yeah !
the mosquitos .
remember that ?
pink , let' s go .
they were a rock group .
ginger and mary ann formed their own group ...
i can' t go until miss wilk gets here , so get benny ... and check me out on the way back .
what ?
coach gave me something to give to you .
they' re really doin ' this .
yeah .
he wants ' em all back by the end of the day .
can you believe that ?
and everybody' s signing it ?
just to get him off our backs .
the coach is just a big fuckin ' asshole .
you sign it , never think about it again .
just let it go .
you' re gonna make a big deal outta this , aren' t ya ?
you' re gettin ' air from there , man .
it' s no good .
you see this ?
it' s gotta be tight .
put some gum around the base to get a good hit .
slate .
benny .
i ain' t believin ' that shit about bonham' s one hour drum solo .
one hour on drums ?
you couldn' t handle that shit on strong acid .
we' re gonna go to the bathroom .
could you let miss wilk know ?
all right .
this is totally amazing .
i voluntarily agree to not indulge in any alcohol , drugs or engage in any other illegal activity ... that may in any way jeopardize the years of hard work ... we as a team have committed to our goal ... of a championship season in ' 76 .
what bullshit .
guys are actually signing this crap ?
apparently .
what are they gonna do next , give you guys urine tests ?
i didn' t know drugs and alcohol were such a big problem ... that they had to resort to neo mccarthyism .
they' re just afraid some of us might be having too good a time .
it' s the old age suppressing youth thing .
neo mccarthism .
i like that .
that' s good , tommy .
and there you guys were in class trying to list all the gilligan' s island episodes ... without even a hint of irony .
what the hell are you talkin ' about ?
you weren' t thinking about it , were you ?
gilligan' s island ?
it' s what' s called a male pornographic fantasy .
oh my ...
think about it !
one a seductive sex goddess type , the other a healthy girl next door type with a nice butt .
so guys have it all ... the madonna and the whore .
women get nothing .
we get a geek , an overweight middle aged guy , some nerdy scientific type .
i mean ...
the professor is sexy .
pink !
come on , man .
we' re off to raise some hell .
look at that !
let' s go kick some ass !

those junior high kids are dead meat .
i promise .

oh , yeah .
okay , you freshman fucks , listen up !
it' s your lucky day .
usually you spend your freshman summer getting your asses busted ... and running for your worthless little lives .
but this year , because we feel so sorry for you , we' re gonna take it easy on you ... and save us all a lot of time .
so if you meet here ... right here ... after school today , you' il only get one lick from each of us .

you wouldn' t know how to write your name if it wasn' t stenciled on your locker .
seriously , everybody .

you' re sitting around the pool all day , chasing the muff around .
break down !

what' s the matter with you , floyd ?
quarterbacks don' t have to do what their coaches say ?
dawson , did you give him that pledge sheet ?
huh ?
the pledge sheet .
did you give it to him ?
yeah , coach , it' s right here .
if you could get that to us by the end of the day , we' d feel a lot better .
you guys see that he does .
all right , coach .
randy floyd .
shit .
before next fall , you' re in need of a serious attitude adjustment , young man .
you better get your priorities straight .

i think you take the whole thing too personally .
you just gotta ...
you gotta shake it off .
don , have you ever thought about why we play football ?
how many times have you gotten laid strictly because you' re a football player ?
i don' t know .
a few , probably .

# deep in the south of texas #
# not so long ago #
# there on a crowded island #
# in the gulf of mexico #
# it didn' t take too much money #
# man , but it sure was nice #
# you could dance all night if you felt all right #
# drinkin ' whiskey and throwin ' dimes #
man , someone' s tokin ' some reefer .
hey , man .
hey , slow down .
yeah , what ?
what' s up ?
what' d you just say ?
when ?
just now , man , when you walked past .
what' d you say ?
a about what ?
you said , " someone' s tokin ' some reefer .
no , i may have said somethin ' about smellin ' some pot .
it was just an observation .
oh , an observation , huh ?
well , who the hell are you , man , isaac fuckin ' newton ?
well , guess what , genius ?
i' m the one smokin ' marijuana ?
you got a problem with that ?
no , of course not .
well , why' d you say that ?
come on , man .
don' t let your mouth write a check your butt can' t cash .
i' m blazin ' with my friends , so i' m a fuckin ' pothead , man .
what' s it to you , huh ?
huh ?
outta observations ?
observe while i punch your teeth down your throat !
come on , dude , relax !
he' s cool , man .
relax .
hey , i' il be watchin ' you , newton .
kick some ass and drink some beer .
looks like we' re almost outta beer .
you okay , man ?
yeah .
why' s it called the moon tower ?
uh , i guess they just decided to put it up here when they were buildin ' the power plant .
actually , it' s a good idea .
i mean , you got a full moon out here every day of the year , you know ?
yeah , but nothing' s ever been repaired , so this whole place could fall down at any time .
so you better watch your step , junior .
whoa !
this place used to be off limits , man ,
' cause some drunk freshman fell off .
he went right down the middle , smackin ' his head on every beam , man .
i hear it doesn' t hurt after the first couple , though .
autopsy said he had one beer , man .
how many' d you have ?
four .
you' re dead , man .
you' re so dead .
look at the bloodstains right there .
shut up .
i' m gonna get that guy .
what guy ?
that asshole on the way in .
clint .
that superdominant male in a ' 50s greaser uniform .
i wouldn' t suggest that , mike .
most fights at places like this ... never get past a punch or two before they' re broken up .
there' s an almost natural instinct not to upset the herd .
so all i gotta do is get in one good punch , play defense and wait .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
at first , i was relieved to get out of the situation , but now there' s this ...
level of humiliation setting in that' s gonna be with me for fucking ever !
i' m not gonna let this be another situation which contributes to me being ... a little ineffectual nothing the rest of my life , you know ?
would you look at this fucking town , man ?
it' s dead .
imagine how many people out there right now are fuckin ' , man .
step inside my ...
just goin ' at it .
hey .
hey .
remember me ?
sure .
you' re sabrina , right ?
right .
how ya doin ' ?
okay .
hey , let' s go .
what brings you here ?
oh , just hangin ' out .
you havin ' fun ?
yeah .
yeah .
so , uh , does your offer from this afternoon still stand ?
what am i supposed to say ?
anything you want .
# do you , you #
# feel like i do # #
why' d we even come here ?
i always feel a little out of place at these things , you know ?
you' re tellin ' me .
i' m being stalked by a nazi .
that a little bit of reefer i smell on you , boy ?
coach is right .
you' re running with that bad crowd again .
you' ve got an attitude adjustment you' ve gotta make right now .
like i' m the only athlete at this fuckin ' party .
coach is right , don .
those guys don' t care if we win or lose .
just remember that .
check this out .
watch this , both of you .
