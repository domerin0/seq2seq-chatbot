father , do you have a name for this sword ?
it' s called " the ultimate sword , " the best sword i' ve made in my life !
which is better martial arts or a good sword ?
a good sword can ... help a novice
and make an expert really powerful
but most important is who is using the sword
kindness is invincible !
lord conquer has led conquer' s clan to the strong position it is today
mud buddha , you are praising yourself
you are in charge of the geomancy here , and if we do well , so will you
i hope so
jester , you are lord conquer' s right hand
truly a servant of one , master of thousands
it' s a dangerous way of living
we always envy each other
his lordship has been waiting all day
greetings , lord !
greetings , my lord !
you' ve come
you know me well
how will i do in my duel with sword saint ?
my lord' s martial arts skill will find no match in the world
neither no name in the south nor ...
sword saint in the north are worthy opponents
mud buddha , you talk like jester
lord , i didn' t teach him to sweet talk
if i can defeat sword saint ,
conquer' s clan will rule the world
but i can tell you , my lord ...
you may have to wait ten years for the duel with sword saint
why do you say that ?
the time has not yet come
my lord , a gift for you
what is it ?
when the wind and cloud combine , the fish with golden scales becomes a dragon
these two birth charts are of the two disciples you will have
one is named wind
the other is named cloud
wind and cloud ?
the wind is formless
the cloud is unpredictable
as to ... how to find them , that depends on your fate
and after i find them ?
you will be invincible for the first half of your life
and the last half ?
find wind and cloud first
jester
yes , my lord
use whatever means necessary
i must find wind and cloud
yes , my lord
this is a persian treasure , it is called the ying yang magic box
it has 108 celestial stems and terrestrial branches
my lord is so intelligent , if you can find ... the correct combination the box will open
it holds the answer to the second half of your life ;
i will then be able to give you an explanation
do not use force to open this box
if you do ... the box will explode and all will be destroyed
good !
i , conquer , can certainly open this box
out of my way !
go away !
by order of conquer' s clan , all boys with the listed birth chart must become disciples of conquer' s clan
master !
master ...
conquer' s clan seeks boys with young master' s birth chart
do not let them know of cloud
yes , sir
cloud
come here
wind , did you memorize the blizzard rhyme i taught you ?
don' t worry father , i remember
when river reaches buddha' s knee , burning then will cirrus cave be
father , what does this mean ?
this river floods all the time
legend says , when the buddha' s knees are flooded ,
cirrus cave up in the mountains will catch fire , and the villages will be flooded too
wind , i have carried you a long time
why don' t you get down and walk with me
i like the feeling of being carried by you
father , will we see mother on this trip ?
who told you , wind ?
i am already ten , no longer a child
promise never to mention your mother again
all women are trouble
conquer , i have retired for many years
why must you force me ?
fire unicorn in the south , ice blizzard in the north
my goal in life is to gather the world' s ten greatest weapons
for you to posses the blizzard blade is a crime punishable by death
i have already buried it in the hills
if you want to fight , we' il use bamboo
but if i win ...
i' il choose between blizzard blade , or your wife
if i loose today' s duel ...
you can have the fire unicorn sword
you must pay for your madness !
whispering prince , you' re using bamboo today
it is only the first round
i' il give you two years
bring blizzard blade to me then at the cirrus cave
i' il take your wife for now
wind , wait here for father
father , i hope you' il bring mother
its been sometime ...
you' re alone ?
ying
husband
how have you been ?
very happy
whispering prince , don' t you understand ?
ying wanted to come with me ,
i never forced her
ying !
didn' t you notice ?
ever since your retirement to the countryside ...
i have never smiled
i want a man to be celebrated hero
i want your humble visitors ... to adore me
now i understand ...
only by robbing you of your love
i can make you fight back
i shall force you to use the blizzard blade
i' il tell you a secret
i only used her to vent my desires
i never loved her
conquer , you are despicable !
mother !
wind !
mother , i miss you
we will fight to the death , but i have one request from you
speak
i have only one son , whispering wind
if i die , please let him live
yes , i promise you
i have dishonoured you and your father
mother !
mother !
don' t !
mother ...
father !
father ...
father !
wind , run !
don' t worry about me !
no , i won' t run away !
run !
hurry !
father ...
what have we stridings done to you ?
why do you destroy my homestead ?
it is our lord' s order
hand over your son and the ultimate sword
give it to conquer' s clan and we will spare you
i' d rather die than surrender !
we' il find the sword after we kill you all
i have hidden it
even if you find it , you cannot use it without it touching my blood or that of my son' s
there' s a child
is he striding sky' s son ?
perhaps not , he isn' t crying at all
take the child and all the swords
yes
where is father ?
where is my father ?
calm down !
my father brought you here or you would' ve been eaten by wolves
curious ?
this is conquer' s clan
i' m charity , daughter of lord conquer he' s frost
you' ve fainted for two days
have some tea i' il take you to eat later
isn' t it too hot ?
my lord' s brilliance will unite heaven and earth ...
these three years , the clan has gone far
we are the greatest clan now
i am naming heirs to further strengthen us
frost ,
cloud and wind will be my closest disciples
with their frost fists , cloud palms and wind kicks
conquer' s clan shall dominate the martial arts world
my lord' s brilliance will unite heaven and earth
unable to meet in battle
duel to death in ten years .
sword saint
mud buddha , you are a true prophet
why didn' t you attack with your full force ?
master' s body is invaluable , i dare not
if i cannot handle your attacks , then i deserve to die
master cloud ,
his lordship wishes to see you and master wind
bring the coloured stones to charity
yes
come in
charity , this is forbidden ground
we are not allowed to go in
to outsiders only , but i' m lord conquer' s daughter
this is the sword grave , our sword storage
if not forbidden , it may still be dangerous
that' s why i asked you to go with me
i' il go in myself , cowards
you two go , i' il stand guard
see , you cherish me more
let' s go , wind
women are trouble
look !
magic fire !
no , these are just firebugs
i' il take some home
someone' s coming .
let' s go
let' s go
with the unique powers of wind and cloud ,
lord conquer has obtained supremacy and expanded his empire
with the strength of his martial arts ,
conquer has overcome all but one of his rivals sword saint
this prophecy is a gift from mud buddha
together with another verse
i' il be able to find out my fate
that other verse is still locked in this magic box
i have been unable to find the right combination for ten years , and mud buddha has disappeared for ten years
frost , wind , i have lost my patience
go and find mud buddha
legend says ...
in order to find mud buddha , one must first seek the fire monkey
use this clue in your search
aren' t you coming with us ?
i am only a watchdog
once i step outside these gates
i' il be doomed .
very fragile ,
i can' t take hardships
jester !
wind , your wind kick lacks practical experience
therefore , on this journey be careful and obey frost
i understand
cloud ,
you have a different mission
i await your orders
fong in unchallenged city wishes to become our ally
i told him
i wanted his unchallenged sword as a token
it' s his birthday , so go to unchallenged city
i will bring back the unchallenged sword
i want more than that ...
bring back fong' s head
can you do it ?
yes , master
you have achieved 70 % of your power with your cloud palms
you can succeed , with hawk' s and bat' s help
father , i want to go , too
charity , what is it ?
if they can go , why can' t i ?
i see ...
would you like to go with wind , or cloud ?
you are going to kill , leave me out
wind , i' il go with you
we' re not going to play
neither am i
we' il help out the weak and be heroes
these are not the teachings of the clan
jester , be quiet
prepare to leave tomorrow
yes yes , master
charity , stay
cloud
have you been to the forbidden sword grave with charity ?
yes , but please don' t tell master
chase me , grandfather !
little pigtails , don' t run !
old man , we' il be fighting here leave quickly
surround him !
i respect you as a shaolin monk
give me the fire monkey !
what a pity
no one can turn down an order from the unchallenged city
to find mud buddha , first seek the fire monkey
why do you want to find mud buddha ?
it is my father' s 60th birthday
i want mud buddha to wish him well and tell him he will live for a hundred years
life is determined by fate
if mud buddha were to tell him he will die on his birthday , then what ?
nonsense !
unchallenged city is at its strongest
together with conquer' s clan , father will rule the martial arts world
soon , even you shaolin monks will have to let us have our way
fire monkey belongs to the shaolin temple
mud buddha stole it , so he must return it
if you refuse to hand it over , you might not return to shaolin !
i am whispering wind pardon my interference
let' s go
they' re about to fight .
let' s go
old man , stay and watch what happens
you don' t know what is out there
it may be more dangerous
who dares to be so arrogant ?
what a pity
wind kick , frost fist
don' t you recognise the masters of conquer' s clan ?
i thought you are all one family
sometimes , quantity doesn' t mean anything
we' il soon ... be one family
why fight among yourselves ?
don' t talk nonsense
don' t associate yourself with us
all of you against one monk ?
you can' t possibly be good men
you' re saying we take advantage of our numbers ?
frost , have we gone too far ?
i don' t think so i' ve only disabled their powers
buddha have pity !
your holiness , this is my first quest
please make it easy on me and lend me fire monkey
i promise to return it in a month
i told you it belongs to the shaolin temple
if you must take it , then how are you any different from those people ?
without fire monkey , we can' t find mud buddha
what shall i tell my master ?
you too are looking for mud buddha ?
you have no respect for me !
that' s right !
shut up !
your holiness , please help us we need fire monkey
i' m sorry but i cannot oblige
then , excuse us
excuse us
firey !
you can insult me some more if you want
now that i have fire monkey .
i' m leaving
wind !
forget him
why ?
we only needed the fire monkey in order to find mud buddha
now that he is already here , why bother ?
sir , please do not disguise anymore
so you recognise me
i know you' re a famous master of disguise
to keep clam in the face of such chaos ... you' re no ordinary man , and when the innocent girl cried out to the monkey , we knew
grandpa , where are they taking firey ?
don' t worry , they won' t hurt him
i revealed too many secrets about the future and was punished by heaven with boils all over my body
only fire monkey can suck out the poison and ease my pain
please bring it back to me
don' t worry , sir .
we' il try our best
that' s good to know
let' s go
lord conquer must be anxious to see me
after you
master fong , you are a great man 3, 000 advisors loyal subjects everywhere
you have all good things one can desire
on this birthday your only son ming has given you a 3 day banquet , but why is he not here celebrating ?
he' s out ...
iooking for mud buddha
has conquer' s clan sent anyone ?
not yet , master
young master , mission complete
master fong looks very happy
everyone from unchallenged city is there , except his only son ming
we' il strike at 4 a . m .
yes , sir !
who is it ?
forgive my intrusion
oh , it' s young master striding cloud !
my master orders me to bring back the unchallenged sword
people from conquer' s clan are so vile !
master , someone is still alive
please don' t kill me !
finish the job
how did this happen ?
why ?
why ?
who murdered our whole clan ?
what good are you ?
what good is mud buddha ?
fire monkey is innocent .
don' t punish it
your holiness
i beg shaolin to seek justice ...
help me seek revenge , and justice
to kill all of unchallenged city in one night ...
only conquer' s clan is powerful enough to do this
buddha have pity on us
wind , what are you thinking about ?
my father died here
master rescued me
legend says ...
blood bodhi fruits grow in cirrus cave
they heal all diseases and increase powers
but no one has successfully gone in ... and returned
they say a fire beast guards the fruit
master wind , do you know anything about your father' s duel ?
so you' ve heard about this ?
master said , it was swordsman southern unicorn
he also died in the cave
promise me one thing
please tell us
little pigtails has lost her parents
i' m her only family
i want to help her find a foster home
do you sense something wrong about this journey ?
when a buddha of mud crosses the river , he cannot guarantee safety for himself
father has been murdered most brutally ... we are all that' s left of unchallenged city
you must help us ?
we have to avenge unchallenged city and my father
you must help me seek revenge .
revenge !
that couple agreed to adopt little pigtails
master wind is a kind person
if everyone in conquer' s clan were like you , the martial arts world would be at peace
how is conquer' s other disciple , cloud ?
cloud is an unpredictable , moody ioner
but his martial arts is the best among us all
exactly as destined
grandpa !
come back , grandpa !
grandpa !
grandpa !
the dragon is powerful but will be stranded when wind and cloud become a storm
years ago , you left without a word
leaving me with this piece of junk
now that the puzzle is revealed
explain what it means !
wind and cloud will make you , and break you as well
what does that mean ?
one cannot fight against his destiny
my lord' s ten years of good fortune has passed
it is now the turning point of your life
wind and cloud will make you , and break you as well
obviously , it means that my life is now under the control of wind and cloud
but does that wind and cloud ... mean my disciples whispering wind and striding cloud ?
it is inevitable that the servant will usurp the master
this is destiny .
mortals cannot fight it
destiny ?
i don' t believe in destiny or fate
my lord was a great believer until now
mortals are like that
believing in good fortunes , but not believing in bad ones
deceiving themselves !
we are the masters of our own destiny !
i hold my destiny in my own hands
i will change my fate !
cloud
wind
four famous weapons of the martial arts world ...
one blade .
three swords all priceless treasures
blizzard blade is buried in cirrus cave
the ultimate sword has never been found
fire unicorn sword and the unchallenged sword are both mine .
i am pleased
cloud , you didn' t disappoint me
you taught me well
good !
father !
behave like a lady
i heard cloud had returned
i just wanted to see him
thank you for your concern
who' s concerned about you ?
i' m concerned about what you owe me
did you bring them ?
what does cloud owe you ?
father , your passion is to collect famous swords
i' m a collector , too
i am fond of interesting stones
cloud owes me 19 colourful stones
ridiculous !
my lord !
my lord !
masters frost and wind have returned
where are they ?
they are outside , and dare not enter
get up !
you lost mud buddha due to inexperience
thank you , master thank you , master
but cloud succeeded , and brought back the unchallenged sword
i' m going back to my chambers
striding cloud' s mood is like a wild horse ... unpredictable
it' s been ten years , with fong' s death ...
i' il hear from sword saint soon
we' il finish our duel from ten years ago
i must intensively train my trinity strength
come here
before i go into seclusion ,
i must settle something
among my three disciples , you have the kindest heart
wind , it is my wish that you marry my daughter
i will arrange for a date
charity , don' t you like wind ?
don' t ask me
look after her
master , let' s discuss marriage later
your father and i had betrothed you to each other
i didn' t tell you earlier because it wasn' t the right time
you and charity have grown up together
what a perfect match
if you do not consent
i will be greatly disappointed
congratulations , wind
skinny , girlie , let me tell you ... father wants me to marry wind
well , i do like wind ... but i also like cloud
charity , it' s me , wind
wind
i want to talk to you
come in
this is not sword grave you won' t be punished
i will be brief
go ahead
i remember when master brought me here , you were the first to offer me some tea
i felt very warm
father said if he hadn' t rescued you , you would' ve been eaten by wolves
i remember
so when he mentioned about marriage today ,
i was very happy
but i know love must come from both sides
i don' t know whether this is master' s wish ,
or if it is your own wish ?
but if this is not what you want , i won' t force you
does charity know about this ?
i' m the one to decide she has to accept it
your eyes , they' re the same as when i took you in ten years ago
if you' re unhappy about this you may be excused from attending the wedding banquet
doctor yu
you' re the most respected person in our village ,
you must help us
you heal us when we are ill
you mediate our fights for us
we respect you the most
we have had bad harvests , and conquer' s clan taxes are high
we can barely survive
please help us
i will go and speak with conquer and explain your hardship
thank you , doctor yu
thank you please get up ...
go home
muse and i will go within these few days
let' s go home
muse
father , your arm is burning again
it does not seem to belong to me , sometimes it hurts so much
they say i can heal all diseases
but i cannot heal myself
father , are we really going to conquer' s clan ?
wonderful !
i can go see the world
i can learn to mingle , and explore
what did you say ?
just babbling
welcome !
master frost !
master frost !
here , try it on
jester , what are you doing ?
the groom will have to tie this on
do me a favor , see how it looks
you look pale and sick
not as pale as you !
charity is getting married are you depressed ?
no .
who said so ?
i watched you all grow up
i can see through everything
if you love someone , you only wish her to be happy
wind has a kind heart
it is good that charity is marrying him
congratulations !
such a tremendous event
i wouldn' t miss it for the world
it' s the groom !
congratulations !
i hear your fiancee is pretty as a flower
i' m not the groom
i am ...
i' m frost of conquer' s clan
welcome , on behalf of my master
so you' re the famous frost
lord conquer has three disciples
fists , palms , kicks
each has a speciality too bad they don' t use swords
you are so crazy about swords
you must be the one known as seedy sword
that' s right !
father , look over there
i am doctor yu from the lake region , representing 320 villages of 16 towns
i seek a meeting with lord conquer
your invitation ?
is there a celebration ?
oh , good !
i have never been to a banquet !
please tell me , is it a birthday , marriage , or a birth ?
muse
there' re so many people anyway
one more or one less wouldn' t even matter
please let us go in to take a look
what is it ?
jester i am doctor yu ...
mr. white face , can you let us in ?
what a smell !
it stinks !
it' s the scent of a woman
women ?
we pick herbal medicines in the mountains
these are the smells of herbs
you pick medicinal herbs ?
then you must be heal all doctor yu with the fire beast arm ?
that' s right
i thank you on behalf of lord conquer
come in , we' il talk after the banquet
look after yourself
leave us
yes , my lord
father
it' s your wedding day today it makes me miss your mother
you look a lot like her
do i really ?
she died giving birth to you
all these years , though i' ve had other women , the one i love the most ... is your mother
i always thought you had a heart of stone
charity ...
do you know what i wish ?
not for the best martial art
not to be ruler of the world
but to see ... my daughter live a happy life
i wish you to marry well
father
conquer !
come out , you old bastard !
i seek revenge on behalf of the unchallenged city !
ming !
you think you can upturn conquer' s clan ?
you are too naive
conquer' s clan destroyed my family
my father was murdered unchallenged sword was stolen
even if i , ming , cannot get revenge
i must have conquer explain his evil deeds
give me unchallenged city , give me my unchallenged sword !
what' s your business with them ?
monks should be charitable and kind
so i promised young master ... to help investigate the murder of his family
i hope you will help , in the name of buddha
how dare you !
today is my daughter' s wedding
i won' t
let any conflict interrupt tonight' s celebration
conquer' s clan may not be as influential as shaolin
but we are the leaders of all the other clans
excuse my directness
support me and prosper or oppose me and die !
buddha have pity
you have explained your position clearly
young master , what do you think ?
my skills are not strong enough ,
i cannot even defeat wind
i am certainly no match for conquer ,
i came to deliver this for my uncle , sword saint
our battle should take place on the autumn solstice
this will settle our ten years old appointment
i' ve waited for this for a long time
everything' s fine now !
a toast , everyone !
music !
i wish i were the bride
you' re such a tomboy who will ever marry you ?
wind is one of the favorite disciples of my lord and he will be his son in law
so after the ceremony , he will be twice as close !
wind , promise me , you must treat charity well
understand ?
i will obey your wishes
let' s bow to the ancestors .
kneel ...
hold it !
cloud
cloud
come with me
striding cloud , how dare you !
i thought you would never come !
why did you agree to marry wind ?
you never asked why
i cannot let another man touch you !
i can marry him and still keep seeing you
charity
come back !
i have obeyed you for 10 years
i' m leaving conquer' s clan and taking charity with me
if you' re a man , go and fight for your wife
don' t let the world laugh at you
fight for your reputation !
cloud
cloud
master !
shut up !
father !
look out !
charity !
she is already my woman .
go away !
charity , is it true ?
i' m sorry , wind
why did you agree to marry me then ?
have you ever loved me ?
yes
it' s all right if you don' t love me
love doesn' t call for an explanation
you' il always be mine
charity , i love you
i' il always be with you
charity ...
master !
i killed my own daughter ...
thanks to the ancestors phoenix is finally pregnant
the lui family line will have continuation , and the xia' s family will continue for generations and prosper !
father in law , bless us
i will take good care of your descendants
lai
you guard this shrine well
even though he is preserved by ice vigor
you must still protect my late father' s body
yes , sir
sit down , phoenix
who is it ?
striding cloud wishes to borrow your ice vigor
what ?
it is the heirloom treasure of our family , how dare you take it ?
i will accert any condition only if you agree to lend it to me
cloud , ice vigor is buried with my late father to preserve his body
i am very moved that you would risk so much for a loved one
but have you thought about my position if you took it away ?
that is your problem , not mine
sorry , i cannot oblige
see our guest out !
phoenix !
dragon !
phoenix , are you okay ?
i came for the ice vigor i do not wish to hurt you
halt !
you may not enter !
leave if you wish to live !
striding cloud , return charity' s body to me
no one can take her away
with your powers ?
i did not teach you the last move of cloud palms
i will show you today so you will die in peace
cloud palms will only work with liquid , and here we are in the desert now
i followed you here before i confronted you
let' s see how much blood you have
i will use it to enrich my trinity strength
charity , wait for me !
father , look !
someone has fainted !
it' s striding cloud who stole the bride !
hurry !
let' s bring him inside !
striding cloud ...
give me back my daughter !
i must avenge for father ?
you must love that girl alot
you' re so romantic you can even love in your dreams
charity ...
muse , what are you doing ?
nothing .
he is still sweating i' il get some medicine
i' ve been asking around
after conquer killed his own daughter
striding cloud took the body and got into a lot of trouble
conquer did all this to him at the royal mausoleum
there is so much hatred between master and pupil
how sad !
he lost his lover and his arm all in one day
father , will he die ?
so you must be very careful when picking a husband
who says i want to get married ?
you do .
its written all over your face
you taught me yourself
as herbal doctors , it is our mission to save and help those who need us
no matter good or bad , a life is a life , right ?
father !
what' s wrong with you ?
father ...
are you all right ?
i won' t think of marriage any more ...
this arm
ever since i succeeded training this fire beast arm , it has been rejecting my body , as though it doesn' t belong to me i can' t control it
muse , tell my assistants to get ready for an operation
hurry !
since striding cloud' s arrival ,
i' ve had a feeling that this arm has found its real master
i am going to give him my fire beast arm
striding cloud , think of it this way
we are repaying a debt from a previous life
good medicine always tastes bitter its good for you
you are ...
i am muse
you have fainted for four days
if my father had not rescued you , you would have died
my arm ...
why ?
like it ?
i put it on for you
you' ve wakened
it was my arm take it as a present from me
we' ve met before , during the wedding ...
muse
fire beast arm finally found its rightful owner
thank you
don' t mention it
striding cloud , your arm is still in recovery
it needs plenty of rest
muse , let' s go ... give him some peace
i' m feeding him his medicine
he has his arms now he can do it himself
wind
for two months you' ve done nothing but drink and sleep
if you go on like this , you will be wasted !
i' m wasted anyway
go with hawk and bat
bring me the blood bodhi fruit
it is in cirrus cave where your father was killed
behave if you know what' s good for you this is an order
cloud ...
cloud ...
cloud ...
cloud
cloud , meal time
you still miss her ?
let me tell you
when i saw your lover at conquer' s clan wearing that beautiful bridal gown ,
i was so envious
they call you muse because you are easily amused ?
certainly not !
i was blessed by a muse at birth
simple as that
thank you both for rescuing me
don' t mention it
will you be returning to conquer' s clan ?
i must
to seek revenge
revenge back and forth with no end when will all this vengeance end ?
in this world some people ... have no friends and no love
i am such a person
father , i like the feeling of being carried by you
mother !
master wind
have some water
come
what is that on the cliff ?
blood bodhi fruit !
they must be blood bodhi fruit !
his lordship once said just one will increase your powers
go away !
come out !
beast !
come out ...
stop shouting
if you keep shouting the beast may come out
master wind , please don' t blame us
that day , all 296 people at unchallenged city took this poison
it' s colourless , scentless , flesh rotting and bone eating
they died in the hands of master cloud
why are you doing this ?
lord conquer ordered it , so we must obey
senseless , it' s senseless ...
it will be a great achievement for us
if we bring back your head and the fruits , we' il be rewarded
i' il give you back the fruits
then we' il call it even .
deal ?
with a heart as clear as ice , the sky may fall and i will not fear
who is it ?
it' s me , jester
congratulations my lord , you have achieved amazing powers !
world dominating powers !
what are you saying ?
this sword saint , such arrogance to challenge my lord
he doesn' t know you have achieved this amazing power
really , you' re fulfilling destiny
fulfilling destiny ?
yes , fulfilling destiny .
oops
jester
you sweet talker , that is nonsense !
no , i dare not every word i say comes from my heart
go out
yes
yes , master
you are the only one i don' t have to worry about
now that wind and cloud have both disappeared and
i must go to battle tomorrow ,
i command you to take leadership of the three halls , and help me rule the world
i only worry about by inability
i have full confidence in you
frost , it is my life' s ambition to beat sword saint
soon , the leadership of conquer' s clan ... will be yours
thank you , master
in the face of battle , to preserve our interests ...
conquer' s clan cannot afford any mistakes
whoever is disloyal to me must die
terminate jester !
he' s a nuisance !
have you seen jester ?
no , no
stop !
please don' t kill me ...
lord conquer is a true villain
he is playing tricks on us all
rubbish !
you betrayed master .
you must die !
he tricked wind and cloud and killed their parents
i' il bring you to a person , then you' il understand
it is mud buddha , lord conquer has imprisoned him
jester , you look ridiculous ... in those clothes
let me get change first , and i' il take you to mud buddha
master frost ...
so the man who kidnapped him the other day was master
i must fight .
i must persist ...
i must not die now
conquer killed your parents
i purposely gave him yours and cloud' s birth chart so he would let you live
destiny ...
all things go in cycles cause , consequences ...
everything will have its final judgement
what shall i do ?
the dragon is powerful , but will be stranded when wind and cloud become a storm
sword saint has come for the duel
a long awaited occassion !
although i now rule the martial arts world , not being able to fight you is like having a bone stuck in my throat
i must get it out to ease my discomfort
i am glad you have preserved your strength .
you still look strong
if i can defeat you today
i will have no regrets
i accept your challenge with my unchallenged sword
and i will have ...
defeated your entire family
wait here
is he human ?
why is he not moving ?
don' t
stay here .
i' m going in
uncle !
conquer , i' il die with you !
i am so useless ...
help me seek revenge
mud buddha said , wind and cloud must be together
or it won' t be a storm
cloud !
blood bodhi fruit can increase your powers
frost , announce to the world ,
i have defeated sword saint , my ultimate opponent
i am now truly invincible
you killed the parents of wind and cloud
you ordered hawk and bat to kill wind , right ?
so you didn' t kill jester ?
conquer , you cold blooded murderer !
i was right
of the three , you are most naive
i refuse to be your successor
you' re only using me !
correct .
let it be known to all
better that they owe me , than i owe them , including you
frost , where are you going ?
i' m leaving conquer' s clan
you think you can come and go as you please ?
frost
so you two are still alive
conquer
sword saint' s martial arts is truly powerful
but nothing compared to my trinity strength
ten years ago , i asked you
aren' t you afraid i' il avenge my father ?
if i can take you in ,
i have planned for such a day
master wind
do not use all your force , do not say all you think
if you go too far , destiny will prematurely end
i taught you all the martial arts you ever knew
remember , i am your master
cloud is unpredictable , wind is formless
you think you two can defeat me ?
let me tell you
this is sword grave , besides swords it will also be your burial ground
prepare to die !
i taught you fists , palms and kicks , but i ultimate weapon is the sword !
the dragon is powerful , but will be stranded when wind and cloud become a storm
mud buddha , i don' t believe in your predictions
i only believe in myself
i have hidden the sword
even if you find it , you cannot use it without my blood or that of my son' s
charity ...
charity
father ... don' t leave me alone
father , help me ...
i' m suffering !
give me back the lives of my family ...
give me back my reputation ...
give me back the lives of my family !
give me back my reputation !
give me back my reputation !
cloud !
what are you doing ?
get out of my way
after all , he raised us
sword saint , whispering prince where are you ?
help me
i am conqueror of the world !
it is said " if you go too far ...
destiny will prematurely end
i am conqueror of the world
i am conqueror of the world ...
i am conqueror of the world ...
