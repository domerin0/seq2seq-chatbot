par tee .
people , please .
it' s a school night .
i thought you two broke up .
this means nothing .
yes , yes , you' ve made that quite clear .
maybe a different outfit would make me look thinner .
this store makes me feel even worse about myself .
i heard she' s back to her birth weight .
must be nice .
no , no , the body on this mannequin is all wrong .
i know .
it' s such an unrealistic standard for young ...
planing down the thighs ,
i make four bucks an hour planing down the thighs .
i don' t look so bad .
don' t worry , lisa .
you can still find someone to love you .
now you' ve got no choice .
non !
oh boy , barty' s gonna party .
he sure is ... if he can keep up with these party animals .
aunt patty , aunt selma , grandma bouvier and ...
grampa .
martin and ralph .
bart' s my bestest boyfriend .
oh mom , this guest list sucks .
it' s the best i could do on such short notice .
where' s milhouse ?
he' s got the measles .
but we' ve got him on speakerphone .
rock on .
you know , the first time i met bart was at recess in first grade ...
oh , i told him to use a land line .
okay , gang , let' s get this party started . or should i say barted ?
for our first game ,
i need everyone to draw a picture of president eisenhower .
i drew him with canadian prime minister louis st. laurent .
their relationship was frosty at best .
duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , ...
say " goose , " you stupid freak .
oh , mom , this was the worst party ever .
gee , i did the best i could ...
here' s lisa .
she' il save the party .
honey , sit down .
have a big slice of cake .
what ?
i' m not fat enough already ?
how could you say that to me ?
lisa , wait ...
hello ?
hello ?
i had to leave ' cause my french bread pizza dinged .
hello ?
duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , ...
what' s the big deal ...
bart didn' t like his presents .
so what ?
it' s not like he gives us such great gifts .
remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper ?
what was that ?
that was crap .
oh , it' s not just the presents .
the kids don' t appreciate me anymore .
they' d rather hang out with their friends than with their mom .
so they' re growing up .
soon they' il be leaving the nest , and you' il have time for yourself . hundreds of thousands of hours ,
and then , the peace of the grave .
no !
no , i' ve got a lot more mothering left in me .
i' il be right here at 3 : 00 to pick you up .
then i' il take you to the zoo .
we can eat fries out of a safari hat !
no , thanks .
i' m going to stay in the library and do a little reading .
well , i guess it' s just you and me , bart !
mom , after that lame party you threw ,
i' d rather hang out with thunder thighs here .
they grow up so fast .
they' re just asserting their independence .
if a child doesn' t do it now , it may never happen .
seymour !
do you want your vitamin in applesauce ?
or are you gonna take it like a big boy ?
applesauce .
oh , sure , you love me now , but you' il turn .
stop struggling and get in my mouth , jerks !
aren' t you the boy who beats up my son ?
prob' ly .
what' s your name ?
simpson .
oh , yeah .
bart simpson .
spiky hair , soft kidneys , always hitting himself ?
those tadpoles are your lunch ?
technically , brunch .
well , here , take this .
my daughter didn' t want the lunch i made .
this sandwich rocks .
my tadpoles seem crude by comparison .
you' re nocturnal .
you don' t have to impress me by making fun of others .
i already like you .
i' m starting to let down my guard .
thanks , mrs. s.
today didn' t totally suck nard .
it' s nice to be appreciated .
whatever .
take it sleazy .
mom ? !
nelson ?
i thought you were sleeping in the park tonight .
oh , that' s okay , the kid don' t bother me none .
hey , nelson , say hello to moe .
he said he' d take you camping sometime .
i said i might .
hey , kids ,
i just heard they canceled league night down at the bowling alley .
you know what that means ?
open lanes !
whaddya say ?
it' il be blam !
bart , lisa and ...
mom .
mom , when i want lame and needy , i' il call milhouse .
no offense .
fine !
i' il take my mothering elsewhere .
ooh , great roll , nelson .
here , i cut up your hot dog for you .
wow , hot dogs are awesome !
you' ve never had one before ?
no , but i saw some in a catalog once .
people in sweaters were eating them at a picnic .
so , my mom works at hooters , but her dream is to go to vegas and work in a real strip club .
and , uh , where' s your dad in all this ?
he went out for a pack of cigarettes and never came back .
he said " smell ya later , " but he never smelled me again .
nelson , how' d you like to earn some extra money around our house ?
i have some odd jobs my kids won' t do .
yeah .
i get the feeling bart isn' t everything he could be in the son department .
sometimes i think he' s more interested in his " itchy and mitchy " cartoons than me .
i' m sure it' s just a phase ,
like when i used to stand on the overpass and drop computers on the freeway .
that' s how we get our kaypro .
64 , 65 , 66 ...
hey , lisa .
are you counting how many days it takes to wash your big butt ?
i can' t hear you .
that' s because your butt blocks your ears .
that doesn' t make any sense .
neither does your butt .
i know this obsession with thinness is unhealthy .. and anti feminist ... but that' s what a fat girl would say .
lis , look !
now , i know there' s a handsome young man behind all that hair and dirt .
maybe not , but you did a great job on the lawn .
thanks , dingus ...
i mean , ma' am .
my mother ... my bully ... my god !
lisa , just take a bite .
one bite ...
that' s all i ask !
now , i can' t have toothpaste tonight .
here' s the money you gave my son .
we don' t want your charity .
i didn' t give your son charity .
i gave him self respect .
self respect , huh ?
no wonder he came home with his vest all buttoned ...
like he was somebody .
go home to your son , mrs. muntz , and try not to have intercourse on the way !
nelson , what are you doing out this late ?
my mom ditched me !
she went to hollywood to be an actress , but her range is limited !
she' s still your mother .
come inside .
can i get you a glass of milk ?
cow milk ? !
what are you doing in my jammies ?
i' m your new roommate .
i call top bunk .
but ... it' s a single bed .
i said top bunk !
mom , the reason god invented dead bolts ... is to keep people like nelson out of your house .
bart , have you ever eaten a tootsie pop ?
you know , there' s a tough , crunchy shell , but if you lick it , there' s a delicious sweetness inside .
be nice to nelson , and i' il give you a tootsie pop .
morning , losers .
mrs. simpson .
pancakes , my favorite !
bart , eat up or you' il be late for school .
i' m not hungry .
you heard the lady , clean your plate !
savor it .
let the flavors dance on your palate .
next on abc ,
who' s dropping by to see george lopez ?
we pray it' s you !
open .
nelson , doesn' t that hurt your teeth ?
my teeth hurt all the time .
i just try to think about motorcycles .
i don' t like the sound of that .
tomorrow i' m taking you to dr. shapiro .
a doctor for your teeth ?
what' s next , a lawyer for your hair ?
papa , can you hear me ?
papa , can you see me ?
papa , can you find me in the night ?
papa , are you near me ?
papa , can you hear me ?
papa , can you help me not be frightened ?
looking at the skies i seem to see a million eyes ...
which ones are yours ?
i gotta do something about him .
this is the perfect test .
if i can have one dab of frosting and then stop ,
i' il know i' ve conquered food at last .
that was too easy .
if i stop here , i still have some dignity .
well , at least she' s not singing streisand .
hey lis , still insecure about your body ?
yeah , a little .
those mean girls just get to me .
i understand .
i have a sister ...
i think she' s dead now who had the same problem .
and i know just the solution .
sherri .
terri .
the only thing sweeter than you two ... are these stolen cookies .
enjoy .
thank you , nelson .
sherri smells , terri smells
stinky all the way
stink stink stink , stink stink stink
one horse open sleigh
thank you , nelson .
he who haw haws last , haw haws best .
i really appreciate you teaching those mean girls a lesson .
tomorrow i can bleach a swear word into their hair .
i' d like that .
nelson ?
papa !
you came back !
i never meant to leave you , nelson .
but something awful happened when i went to the store .
well , that explains a lot .
who' s hungry ?
no .
i want to hear what happened at the store .
well , i went in to buy cigarettes ...
could you gift wrap them , please ?
they' re for my son .
i also bought myself a candy bar , which , uh , unfortunately was filled with peanuts , to which i am allergic .
i ran outside just as the circus was rolling into town .
and that' s where i found him .
i brought him back here so he could take nelson away , and my bruises would heal .
i want to give you a home again , son .
and so do i.
mom !
i got an acting job .
from the third director i slept with .
i play lady macbeth .
i don' t have to take my top off , but i do anyway .
well , i' m glad everything worked out so well .
the muntzes are back in business .
yep , the four muntzes .
thanks for finding my dad , bart.
and thanks , lady , for making me feel good about myself .
so , now that you' re happy again ,
i guess you won' t beat me up at school anymore .
i wish it were that simple .
i really do .
they' re a family again .
and so are we .
what happened ?
sometimes you have to adopt your son' s bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer .
and lisa , what have you learned ?
nothing .
like many women , i still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight .
but talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution , right ?
i guess .
but there' s a long way to go .
come on , say something conclusive .
i' m afraid this is a very open ended problem .
oh , open ended ? !
oh , come on , lisa .
say everything' s fine .
everything' s fine .
that was you .
prove it .
