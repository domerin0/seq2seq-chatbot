watch this .
you' re a mess , joe .
you' re not fooling anybody .
no , rita .
he' s a mess .
i' m getting better every day .
you got a perforated eardrum , enders .

you can' t go back to war if you can' t stand up .
let' s go , marines .
this war ain' t gonna wait forever .
let' s go .

transcribe now .
victor , victor .
this is x ray .
over .
damn it !
we got a unit under fire !
we' re losing men .
i need this message decrypted .
request fire support .
we have target at one one niner , baker one five .
pillbox with heavy machine gun .
fire at will .
beginner' s luck .
you' re up , mac .
corporal enders reporting , sir .
at ease .
you' ve done well as a marine , corporal .
better than you did as a civilian .
stole a motorbike , crashed it .
got kicked out of high school .
assault and battery ... on one father crispin o' donnell ?
a priest ?
assistant principal at archbishop keenan high school , sir , and head disciplinarian .
public school boy myself .
some minor problems in boot .
a commendation for valor in shanghai .
and you made a hell of a stand on the solomons .
tough bit of business there , huh ?
pretty tough , sir .
but you' re prepared to jump right back into it ?
yes , sir .
very much so .
very much so .
well ...
the japs have pretty much busted every code we' ve thrown at ' em , corporal .
you men on the solomons were lost to a broken code .
tell me something .
you ever run into any indians on the solomons ?
indians , sir ?
navajo , to be exact .
the corps has developed a new code based on their language .
it' s had quite an impact .
so much so the navy have decided to go to great lengths to protect it .
that' s why you' re here .
you' re to pair with one of them , keep his ass safe .
your job is to keep him alive so he can do his job .
begging the major' s pardon , but i believe i' d best serve the corps killing japs , not baby sitting some indian .
enders , we didn' t pick your name out of a hat .
we need good marines .
that' s why you' re standing here .
take a look .
it' s a navajo .
or it was .
tortured to death by japanese intelligence trying to bust our code .
fortunately , he couldn' t help them even if he wanted to .
sir ?
man' s a navajo , not a codetalker .
code' s based on their language , but it is still a code .
tojo would like nothing more than to catch a live one .
what i' m about to tell you , corporal , cannot leave this room .
under no circumstances can you allow your codetalker to fall into enemy hands .
your mission is to protect the code ... at all costs .
you understand me ?
yes , sir , i do .
good .
congratulations .
you just made sergeant .
keep those hands vertical .
way to go , marine .
fortino , take over .
hey ...
that was you , right , sitting in front of the major' s office ?
yeah .
listen , i' m pete henderson .
they call me ox .
not cos of my big muscles or anything .
i' m from oxnard , california .
just north of hollywood a ways .
so you' re with jasco too , huh ?
hey , know where we might find 2nd joint assault signal ?
hey , know where we might find 2nd joint assault signal ?
no fuckin ' idea , mac .

i' ve never seen so many white men .
they' ve never seen so many navajo .
looks to me like you got to see a little action there .

jap sons of bitches shot me right in the ass .

i wasn' t running or nothin ' .
so , your duty with jasco have anything to do with these navajo radiomen ?
i' m not at liberty to say .
i see you got a new stripe there .

hell of a thing , huh ?
ain' t a democracy , sergeant .
it' s the marines .
yeah .
they look pretty normal , i guess .
expecting them to wear war paint ?

orders finally came through .
we ship out tomorrow morning .
destination : the island of saipan , which is one of the stepping stones we gotta take on our road show to tokyo .
it' s of strategic importance that we capture this island .
we can get ourselves an advanced naval base and an airstrip to land and refuel b 29' s and get our bombers within range of tokyo .
now , saipan is japanese soil , and there' s 30, 000 of ' em dug in .
they' re gonna fight for every square inch , because it' s their home , but we' re gonna take it away from ' em !
yeah !
kill me some japs !
we' re gonna be in front of the whole damn division .
we' re gonna be the eyes and the ears .
we' re gonna be sniffin ' out enemy positions , coordinating the naval gunfire exactly what we' ve been training to do for the last four months .
all right ?
now , we got some new radiomen from headquarters .
there' s a private whitehorse ...
and yahzee ... and a couple of sergeants , enders and henderson , who , if i' m understanding these orders correctly , will be covering our navajos ' asses .
goddamn you , joe enders !
... but i' m tellin ' you , we' il be steppin ' into our share of the shit nonetheless .
any questions ?
sounds like you' re dying .
these might help get rid of the taste .
charlie and i , we both lost it on the boat ride from san diego .
not many bodies of water in arizona .
life savers really helped .
you want a life saver ?
what are you doin ' here ?
just trying to help .
not what i meant .
you mean what am i doing in this uniform ?
it' s my war too , sergeant .
i' m fighting for my country , for my land , for my people .
not your people i' m worried about .
listen , enders , i' m a codetalker .
it takes me two and a half minutes to do what used to take an hour .
now , somebody wearing a lot more stripes than you thinks that' s worth something .
remind me to time you when you got bullets flying over your head .
what the hell' s wrong with you ?
shave his belly with a rusty razor
shave his belly with a rusty razor early in the morning !
from the halls of montezuma
to the shores of tripoli
we will fight our country' s battles
on the land and on the sea
first to fight for right and freedom
and to keep our honor clean
we are proud to claim the title
of united states marines

there' s plenty of dollies outside of rhode island , nell .
many plenty .
well , there sure as shit ain' t any here .
ain' t that the truth .
that' s cos they' re all in daytona beach .
the most beautiful women in the world .
this one time , before the war ,
i' m lyin ' on the beach and this sweet little thing named molly comes out the water .
she walks straight up to me and asks me if i' m hungry ... cos she' s havin ' a weenie roast .
shit !
damn .
yeah , me and molly , oh boy .

maybe they know our orders .
think you could do it , joe ?
give it a rest , henderson .
give it a rest ?
i keep tryin ' , but ...
i' m here to kill japs , not marines .
i saw you a warrior , yahzee ...
you will make your family proud .
what the hell you think you' re doin ' , boy ?
getting on my uniform .
you know the difference between you and a jap , yahzee ?
it' s that uniform .
that' s it .
see , i know you people .
i know what kind of slanty eyed savage you are , boy .
you ought to be careful out here all alone .
no baby sitter .
i might just take you for a jap .

fuckin ' shitbird .
supposed to be with a baby sitter all the time , i thought .
out here huntin ' salmon and shit .
that ceremony you saw last night ?
it' s called a protection ceremony .
navajo believe , until a body' s given a proper burial , the spirits stay near it .
chindis that' s what we call evil spirits .
demons .
i haven' t thought much about it since i was a kid .
till i saw those dead bodies .
you telling me you saw ghosts , private ?
no , sergeant .
i' m telling you i won' t freeze up again .
no , sergeant .
i' m telling you i won' t freeze up again .
because your buddy smeared ash on your forehead ?
that' s right .
cos my buddy smeared ash on my forehead .
you ever see ghosts ?
no more stupid questions today , private .
that' s an order .
sounds beautiful .
you , uh , you self taught ?
my dad was always playing .
you know what they say : if you can' t beat ' em ...
no shit .
my dad , he ... he gave me this thing .
used to call me the pied piper of the pigs .
used to bring ' em in for feeding with this little tune i played .
i know i ain' t gonna get you to quit playin ' that thing , so ...
like you just said , if you can' t beat ' em ...
i don' t think it' s gonna work .
well , we ain' t got much else to do out here .
what the hell ?
ok .
all right , you lead off .
i' il follow you .
2nd recon company will move out at 0600 and scout along road 04 .
you can expect light resistance northwest of the palm grove .

remember , marine , " ours is not to question why , ours is but to do or die .
semper fi .
over .
dear joe , how the hell are you ?
or , given that you' re not much of a writer , should i not expect an answer ?
the newspapers say our boys are doing great .
but i don' t think the reporters have been to kaneohe bay hospital .
i found a stray dog the other day on waikiki .
i gave him a bath and took him in .
he reminded me of you but cuter .
at least he keeps me warm at night .
i try not to think about you .
about what might be happening over there .
but sometimes , when i' m lying in bed ,
i can' t keep myself from wondering where you are .
how you' re doing .
what the hell you doin ' ?
writing a letter to my son .
forget your orders ?
no letters out .
command don' t want postmarks going to the reservation .

my wife wasn' t so sure .
she' s a little more traditional .
nice looking family .
