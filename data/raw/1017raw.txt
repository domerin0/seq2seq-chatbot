i need money .
yes , it is a lovely morning .
sun is shining , the birds are chirping .
only dentist i know who can' t make money .
oh , really ?
what about her father ?
as a dentist , my husband was very successful .
it was just that other stuff .
there' s a word for that stuff .
embezzlement .
speaking of which , how much do you need , dear ?
five should probably do it .
thousand ?
for what ?
your father would be proud .
i' il see what i can do .
in the meantime , ladies , have a lovely day .
i would , if you do me a favor and die .
excuse me .
are you threatening me ?
i didn' t think so .
look , i changed my mind , okay ?
yes , i' il get you your money back .
morning , doctor .
good news , monsieur boulez .
we won' t have to pull the tooth .
all we have to do is drill .
no drill .
no drill ?
no drill .
i hate the drill .
so just gas me , pull the tooth out , and we' il still be friends .
okay ?
good .
a hamburger and fries .
i' m gonna have a hamburger with no mayonnaise this time .
no mayonnaise ?
no mayonnaise .
not at all .
she' il put mayonnaise on it .
mind if i say something ?
leave the bitch !
excuse me ?
your wife .
leave her .
find somebody else and just start over .
oz , look , i know it' s none of my business .
i know i' ve only been working for you for three weeks .
but i' m telling you what i see .
your wife is not a good person .
you expect an argument ?
so why do you torture yourself ?
just divorce her .
i can' t afford to .
she' d take me to the cleaners .
i' m already paying her father' s debt .
so she' il just ride it out till daddy' s debt gets paid .
she' s just charming .
she can' t help it .
her mother ....
what' s a nice way of ... ?
well , she' s the antichrist .
you' d be doing the world a favor ... ... if you' d just have her whacked .
you know somebody who' d do this ?
present company excluded ?
hypothetically ?
or do you want me to name a price ?
you should talk to my wife .
you' d make a fortune .
what makes you say that ?
life insurance .
i' m worth more dead than alive .
dining room .
take the plastic junk off of there .
can you move any slower than this , fellas ?
you must be our new neighbor .
i' m nicholas oseransky .
call me oz .
jimmy .
jimmy jones .
have we met before ?
are you sure ?
yeah .
i' d remember .
i got a thing with faces .
that' s weird .
you look so familiar .
where are you from ?
where do you want this ?
order !
upstairs , back bedroom .
what were you saying ?
you all right ?
you sure ?
because you look like you got some gas .
well , i had a hamburger for lunch .
they put mayonnaise on it ?
can you tell me why they do that ?
every red blooded american knows ... ... that the only condiment you ever put on a hamburger ... ... is ketchup !
or maybe some of that special sauce you like so much here in canada !
which has a little mayonnaise in it too .
i swear to god , when they slop that mayonnaise on , i could kill somebody .
i really didn' t wanna upset you .
who' s upset ?
i' m just having a conversation here .
i' m gonna go home .
feel better .
thank you .
oz .
yes !
thanks for stopping by ... ... welcoming me to the neighborhood .
pack up !
pack it up , we' re leaving !
jesus !
jesus !
i just bumped into our new neighbor .
you know who that is ?
i suppose you' il tell me .
jimmy " the tulip " tudeski .
and that means something ?
jimmy the tulip was a hit man for the gogolak gang !
the hungarian gang back in chicago that ran the north side ?
and that guy , jimmy , was laszlo gogolak' s key enforcer !
sexy .
sophie , the man' s killed 1 7 people .
why the stupid name ?
the tulip " ?
that' s his flower of choice .
it' s what he sent to his victim' s funerals .
i wonder why he' s here .
hiding out , most likely .
he ratted out laszlo gogolak .
now laszlo' s spending his life in prison .
jimmy only got five years , and dave told me he refused witness protection .
protection ?
from ... ?
i' m sure laszlo' s son , janni , wants to put one of those ... ... you know , a price on his head .
you mean a contract ?
a mob contract ?
feeling better ?
yes , thank you .
good .
let' s go for a drive .
a drive ?
yeah , a drive .
i don' t know anyone else in town .
i figured we could go for a drive .
you could show me the sights , you know .
it won' t kill you .
promise ?
so i take it you' re not canadian .
only by marriage .
where you from ?
chicago .
not " chicago " chicago .
i was born there , but i don' t really know anything about chicago anymore .
totally oblivious to anything even related to chicago .
i' m from jersey .
new jersey ?
yeah .
new jersey .
if you' re from jersey , you' re from jersey .
jersey' s another place i know absolutely nothing about .
you always this nervous ?
yes .
like everything else that' s wrong in my life ... ... it all started with the little missus .
back home , her father and i ran a dental practice together .
you' re a dentist ?
afraid so .
you suicidal ?
why would you say that ?
i read that dentists are prone to suicide .
jimmy , i may hate my life , but i certainly don' t wanna die .
get used to it because you' re going to .
i' m gonna kill you !
i' m gonna strangle you !
everybody dies .
sooner or later .
tulip ?
no !
so you were saying your father in law ....
well , ironically , he was a suicide .
stats don' t lie .
he got caught molesting a patient .
an underage patient .
an underage male patient .
please , stop .
i know .
so this kid starts to blackmail him .
at the exact same time , the irs decides to investigate him for tax fraud .
so big aaron needs money , and fast .
so he goes to a loan shark ... ... takes out a loan against our company ... ... which i had no idea about ...
... then proceeds  to hit vegas , atlantic city , reno .
loses all the money and sticks you with the bill .
am i right ?
you are right .
that' s exactly right .
so after the ensuing scandal and bankruptcy and embarrassment ... ... my wife and her mother decided it would be best that we move back here .
you like living in canada ?
no , i live here with my wife .
you sure you' re a dentist ?
yeah , why ?
i' ve never met a dentist i liked .
well , i try to keep things as painless as possible .
me too .
it' s been good .
i' m glad we got to know each other .
you know what ?
me too .
you can go now .
great .
yes , dear ?
thank god you' re home .
thank god i' m home ?
i had an idea .
i figured out a way we can pay off daddy' s debt .
you' re getting a job .
our new neighbor .
there' s a price on his head ?
your plan is you' il murder our neighbor ?
here' s what you' re going to do .
you' re going to chicago ... ... you' re going to find out who' s offering this price on his head
jimmy tudeski' s head ?
then you' il tell them you know where he is ... ... after you negotiate a finder' s fee .
a finder' s fee on a murder contract .
is that a problem ?
other than the fact that would make me a party to a murder ?
but he' s a killer .
you said so yourself .
that' s another good reason not to do it .
whatever he' s done , he' s been to prison , he' s paid his debt to society .
well , now he can pay our debt too .
all right , look , i know this is gonna sound crazy ... ... but i spent some time with the guy today ... ... and he' s pretty nice .
and besides , he hasn' t done anything to me .
he came on to me .
what ?
he came on to me !
that animal , he made a pass at me !
when ?
earlier .
this morning .
before you came home .
he said you guys haven' t even met .
who do you believe ?
a killer or your wife ?
do i have to answer that ?
let' s say ... ... that he did make a pass at you .
the guy' s been in prison .
he' s desperate .
he' d sleep with a meat grinder .
you pig !
you disgust me !
there' s a known killer next door who might slaughter us in our sleep ...
... and you won' t lift a finger !
that' s right !
i' m not gonna lift a finger because this is crazy .
you do this for me ... ... and i give you your divorce .
and if you don' t do this for me , i swear ... ... i' il make your life so damned miserable ... ... these past few years will seem like a pleasure cruise .
i already booked your flight .
you leave tomorrow at 9 a . m .
you better start packing .
when are you coming back ?
i have to reschedule your appointments .
shouldn' t be more than two days .
are you going alone ?
yes .
good .
can you do me a huge favor while you' re there ?
go out and get laid !
jill !
call me the second you get back .
better yet , call me right after .
call me during .
i want details .
now , don' t expect too much .
i' m not sure i' il be able to contact these people .
it' s not as if the gogolaks have a 1 800 number or anything .
i know you' il do what you can .
what is this ?
good luck , my darling .
and hurry home .
do they have vomit bags on the flight ?
you' re jimmy tudeski , aren' t you ?
jimmy the tulip ?
don' t worry , your secret' s safe with me , sexy .
but you will never believe what my darling husband is up to .
you' re back in chicago ?
great .
tell you what , meet me at ekins oyster bar in 45 minutes .
dave , you got nothing to worry about .
how can i not worry ?
you' re back in chicago to rat jimmy tudeski out to janni
but i' m not going to rat him out .
you think i' m suicidal ?
you are a dentist .
look , i have no intention of ratting anybody out .
the only reason i' m here is to get sophie off my back .
all right , i' ve got a deadline .
i' il come by when i' m finished .
in the meantime , promise not to do anything stupid .
why would you even say that ?
you married sophie , didn' t you ?
i' il get the check then ?
i' m sorry .
i must have the wrong
what room you looking for ?
51 9 .
you' re in the right place .
you nicholas oseransky ?
who are you ?
we hear you have information about the whereabouts of jimmy the tulip .
did dave tell you ?
who' s dave ?
what did he tell you ?
forget about dave .
for our immediate purposes , there is no dave .
dave does not exist .
so just answer my question .
do you or don' t you ... ... have information regarding the whereabouts of jimmy the tulip ?
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
really ?
then i must have been misinformed .
i apologize .
it' s okay .
now ... ... let' s try this again .
we understand you have information regarding
who told you that ?
why do you wanna clutter your mind with the inconsequential ?
what' s important is ... ... we know that you know where jimmy tudeski is .
look , i really have no
won' t you cry for help ?
will it do any good ?
who are you ?
franklin figueroa .
a. k . a .
frankie figs .
i work for janni gogolak .
oh , my god .
so where' s jimmy ?
look , i sw
my brother , believe me , you don' t wanna dance with me all night .
and for a scumbag like jimmy t ?
save yourself the pain .
look , i really have no
i may know where he is .
well , all right .
but don' t tell me .
let' s go tell janni .
mind if i piss a little blood first ?
please , by all means .
my father ... ... is a great man .
a man of vision ... ... and character .
a man who stood up for his beliefs .
unlike that rat fuck ... ... piece of shit ... ... tudeski .
can you ...
... ask cynthia to join us , please ?
want a drink ?
oh , no , thanks .
have a drink .
scotch and soda , please .
i want you to understand ... ... frankie explained to me you' re having a problem with your conscience .
it' s just that none of this was my idea .
think it was mine ?
no .
if i had my way , my father would still be running things ... ... and i' d be somewhere like ....
i don' t know .
... aruba .
aruba' s not that nice .
excuse me ?
you may like it .
i honeymooned there , and that' s probably why i didn' t like it .
the thing you gotta remember is , when we' re talking about jimmy tudeski ... ... we' re not talking about a human being .
we' re talking about a rodent .
we' re talking about ... ... vermin .
where was l ?
vermin .
i think vermin .
we' re talking about someone screw that !
some thing ... ... that doesn' t deserve to be breathing ... ... the air .
you talking about yourself again ?
mr. oseransky ... ... this is cynthia .
jimmy' s wife .
cynthia , it seems that mr.
doctor .
excuse me ?
dr. oseransky .
he' s a dentist .
whatever .
it seems that our dentist friend here knows where jimmy is .
come to collect on the contract ?
since i' m the one that found this guy , i want it .
the contract' s mine .
just as long as i' m in on the kill .
so long as i get full price .
i wanna see that spineless rat beg .
money doesn' t matter .
now i' ve heard everything .
don' t believe it .
this one ?
kill you for a quarter .
frankie will accompany you back to canada .
you will lead him to the man you believe is jimmy tudeski .
but , sir  frankie , you' il let me know ?
all right then .
mr. gogolak .
my wife would make my life even more miserable than it already is ... ... if i didn' t at least ask .
is there gonna be any kind of finder' s fee for this ?
finder' s fee ?
i tell you what .
tell your wife we' il work something out .
cynthia , don' t rush off .
we should chat a little .
i' il call you in the morning .
we' il leave first thing .
you won' t do anything stupid like leaving me in the lurch ?
who did you talk to ?
what do you mean ?
you know frankie figs ?
i know of him .
when i came back from lunch , he was in my room .
frankie figs was in your room ?
yes .
he knew that i knew where jimmy is .
what did he do ?
after he played congas on my kidneys , he took me to see janni gogolak .
you' re kidding .
who did you tell ?
i wanna know who you told !
no one , i swear !
well , then how ?
what am i gonna do ?
i' il talk to you later .
room service .
this is dr. oseransky in room 51 9 .
i' m gonna need a bigger bottle of scotch .
it' s me .
how you doing ?
i don' t know .
i' ve done something terrible .
what could be so terrible ?
you' ve gotta get out of canada .
just get the hell out .
i' m in chicago .
yeah , i heard about that .
have you seen janni yet ?
how' d you know ?
relax .
i know about the whole thing , okay ?
don' t worry .
i' il explain everything to you when you get back , okay ?
in the meantime , have a good time while you' re down there .
live it up .
we' il talk when you get back .
if you say so , jim
you gonna invite me in , or do i go down and tell janni' s guys you' re impolite ?
janni' s guys are downstairs ?
yes , come in .
love a man with manners .
janni sent me to see if you' re on the level .
janni' s the trusting type .
so do you or don' t you ?
do i or don' t i ... ?
know where my wayward husband is .
mrs. tudeski
cynthia .
why be formal with the woman you' il widow ?
you don' t understand .
what' s not to understand ?
you want your 30 pieces of silver .
my question is , why didn' t you do the job yourself ?
why didn' t i ... ?
why didn' t you kill jimmy and collect on the contract ?
didn' t you have the stomach for it ?
or is your problem a little further south ?
did you vomit recently ?
a minute ago .
i was just gonna brush my teeth .
i' il wait .
mrs. tudeski ....
cynthia , none of this was my idea .
you just happened to travel 1 000 miles to rat jimmy out to janni .
that' s what i' m trying to say !
it wasn' t my idea .
it was my wife' s .
she wanted me to come to chicago and rat jimmy out .
maybe it would be best for everybody if you went to janni ... ... and said that i' m crazy , that i' m nuts .
i' m chemically imbalanced .
i' m wacko !
maybe that would be the best thing .
because ....
tell him i' m acting the way i' m acting right now .
but you do know where jimmy is , don' t you ?
look , mrs. tudeski , i don' t want anybody to die .
that is on the level .
what do you want ?
what do i want ?
i just want this all to end .
i am so damn scared .
that' s room service .
before i vomited , i ordered scotch .
there you go .
thank you .
what would you say to a drink ?
i' d say no ice , no water , in a tall glass .
what can i say ?
i was young .
jimmy was like no man i' d ever met before .
yeah , well , he' s the first killer i' ve known .
no one like him at my daddy' s country club .
lousy husband , though .
cheated on me constantly .
so why didn' t you just ... ?
divorce him ?
jimmy doesn' t believe in divorce .
thinks it' s a sin .
a hit man with morals .
go figure .
now that he' s out of prison , are you guys gonna get back together ?
assuming frankie and janni don' t kill him first ?
jimmy and i are over .
even if i wanted to make another go of it , which i don' t ... ... there' d always be that other thing between us .
what other thing ?
the fact that he wants to kill me .
why ?
you' re a sweet guy .
money .
are you rich ?
the money laszlo gogolak gave us as a wedding present .
only it wasn' t a wedding present .
laszlo was parking the money with us to hide it from the feds .
how much was it ?
ten million dollars .
hell of a parking space .
the only way to get the money was if jimmy and janni and i ... ... all signed for it together .
if you didn' t have all three signatures , you' d need two signatures .
and a death certificate .
or one signature and  two death certificates .
that' s why jimmy wants to kill you .
let' s not forget about janni .
then he gets the money .
all of it .
the whole nine yards .
what if you told him you didn' t want the money ?
i did tell him .
i don' t want a dime .
he knows i don' t wanna be married , and he doesn' t believe in divorce .
but murder , he' s okay with .
it' s what he does .
if it was me , 1 0 million wouldn' t be enough .
how much would it take for you to kill your wife ?
i' m talking about you .
what' s your price ?
that' s what i' m saying .
i think you are the most beautiful thing i have ever seen ... ... and i cannot believe i am saying this out loud .
that' s just the scotch talking .
no , it' s me .
i' ve spent the last seven years just waiting for something to happen .
i didn' t even know what it was .
until you walked in that room at janni gogolak' s house .
i' m sorry .
i' ve embarrassed you .
i should go .
please .
you' re a nice guy .
but i' ve gotta go .
let' s go .
the night' s still young .
you boys in any rush to get back ?
did you mean what you said ?
i' ve got till midnight .
in the meantime ....
promise me something .
anything .
you' il go slow .
i haven' t made love in five years .
neither have l .
i' ve been married .
it' s almost time .
again ?
what did you have , oysters for lunch ?
actually , i did .
jimmy knows i' m here .
here with me ?
here in chicago .
talking with janni .
how ?
how did he know that ?
i told him .
you what ?
he already knew .
how ?
i' m guessing my darling wife .
is she trying to get you killed ?
that' s all i can come up with .
but when i talked to jimmy ... ... he didn' t sound upset .
he wouldn' t .
he' d be your best friend right up until the moment he
he' s gonna kill me , isn' t he ?
and when he' s done with that , he' il come after you .
i' m not gonna let jimmy kill you .
i' m gonna take frankie to jimmy .
so frankie can kill him .
if there was any other way ....
but better jimmy than you .
don' t you get it ?
either way , i' m dead .
why ?
once jimmy' s dead , why would janni keep me alive ?
he' d kill me too
so he can collect on the whole $1 0 million .
i' m not gonna let that happen .
i swear , i am not gonna let anybody kill you .
under the circumstances , that' s the most romantic thing i' ve ever heard .
thanks .
you what ?
you told jimmy ?
what the hell did you do that for ?
i felt bad .
i like him .
i liked him .
not anymore ?
it' s hard to be friends with somebody who wants to kill you .
if you sold me out to janni , then told me about it , i' d ice your ass too .
i know .
i can close that gap for you .
really ?
you' d be in and out .
you' re kidding .
no , not a problem .
so did you do it ?
did you do what i told you to do ?
i won' t answer that .
so you did !
i can tell !
you had sex !
full size car , please .
i wanna hear all about it .
i gotta go .
any emergencies , i' ve got my beeper on .
fine , be that way .
i don' t need no insurance .
the hell bitch called .
she and her mom went to niagara falls .
yeah , probably working on her alibi .
i gotta go .
why don' t you drive back to the hotel with me ?
unless you' d rather go home in broad daylight ... ... with jimmy right next door .
yeah , i' il go with you .
frankie figs .
jimmy t.
what' s going on ?
what' s up , baby ?
what' s up , frankie ?
welcome to montreal .
what up , partner ?
good to see you .
looking good .
oz , you look worried .
doesn' t he look worried ?
he does .
why don' t you relax ?
come on , frankie told me what a standup guy you' ve been .
now , change your pants .
we' re going out .
i' m gonna keep the coke and the fries ... ... but i' m gonna send this burger back .
if you put any mayonnaise on it ... ... i' il chop your legs off , set your house on fire ... ... and watch as you drag your bloody stumps out of your house .
i' m fine .
you' re fine ?
let me tell you something .
you are not fine .
you know your wife wants you dead ?
that much i' ve figured out .
i thought you should know i' m not the first one she came to .
the first ... ?
hitter .
there were others ?
at least one .
that fell through , so she came to me .
what did you tell her ?
you mean , did i take the contract ?
no .
i didn' t take the contract .
how much she offer you ?
ten grand .
no wonder you turned her down .
but you did turn her down .
even though i went to janni ?
you didn' t go to janni .
jimmy sent me to come to you .
and i know that frankie can be very persuasive .
by the way , how' s your urination ?
fine .
thank you .
so why did you want me to go see janni ?
so you could tell him where i was .
so he' d come here , and you' d kill him ?
exacto .
by the way , i' d be happy to do your wife for you .
do my wife ?
tap her .
whack her .
whack her ?
oh , see , i thought you meant , you know ....
because she told me that you , you know , hit on her .
that' s funny .
why is that funny ?
i wasn' t gonna tell you this ... ... but the truth is , your wife came on to me .
and ... ?
we' re friends .
friends do not engage in sexual congress with each other' s wives .
besides ... ... l don' t find your wife particularly attractive .
you just got out of prison .
you' ve been in prison for five years , and you don' t find her attractive ?
she' s not a good person .
you' ve killed 1 7 people , and you don' t think my wife is a good person ?
it' s not important how many people i' ve killed .
what' s important is ... ... how i get along with the people that are still alive .
you gonna finish this ?
just take it .
we' ve given it long enough .
give janni a call .
the sooner he gets here , the better .
so after you kill janni , you go back to chicago ?
no , i' m done with chicago .
what about your wife ?
you gonna get back together with her ?
you' re gonna kill her too ?
for a hell of a lot more than $1 0, 000 .
you can' t do that .
why not ?
because she' s your wife !
you were right about him .
this is one exceedingly sweet man .
wife like his and still he believes in wedding vows .
so do l .
especially till death do us part .
oh , god .
it' s my beeper .
i gotta go to the office .
well , wedding vows or not ... ... i' d watch my back .
your wife' s still shopping for a hitter .
good luck .
mr. tourette , i think we' il have to pull the tooth .
oz , what is it ?
what' s the matter ?
i am your friend .
talk to me .
i have to talk to somebody because i' m gonna
take your time .
that' s good .
first of all , i just found out my wife is trying to have me killed .
who told you ?
a friend .
anyone i know ?
he' s my next door neighbor .
and here' s the funny part .
he' s a hit man too .
really ?
what' s his name ?
jimmy .
jimmy tudeski .
jimmy the tulip ?
jimmy the tulip lives next to you ?
and you know him ?
can you introduce me to him ?
he' s a professional killer .
you don' t understand .
i' ve wanted to meet him for years .
please ?
come on !
quick , come on !
what' s this ?
i don' t know .
it is you .
mr. tudeski , you don' t understand .
i' m one of your biggest fans .
i followed your career since i was a kid .
you' re why i' m trying to get into the business .
what business would that be ?
contract killing .
it' s what i wanna do .
if i could have one afternoon , i know i could learn so much from you .
so come in .
you too .
what' s all this ?
you know her ?
she' s my assistant .
you know she was a hitter ?
actually , i' m still a virgin .
i haven' t killed anyone yet .
professionally .
oz was supposed to be my first .
excuse me ?
his wife hired me .
that was you ?
to make it look like an accident , i worked for him ... ... to familiarize myself with his habits .
get to know him .
smart .
but then , after i got to know him , i started to like him .
first mistake .
i know !
you should get close , but not too close .
pour yourself a martini .
it' s 4 : 00 in the afternoon .
don' t give yourself a hard time .
your whole career' s ahead of you .
i remember when i was starting out .
i hadn' t really done that much .
i' d done a few things , saw some money .
i was doing something i liked .
then i was recruited ... ... by laszlo gogolak .
and the first thing he wanted me to do was whack his cousin .
is this the stanley posilansky incident ?
anyway , laszlo doesn' t want it to look like a hit .
all right ?
so i' ve gotta get close to stanley ... ... who was this really charming , cute , funny little guy .
weird sense of humor .
made me laugh .
i liked him as a person .
you know what i mean ?
you got too close .
i got too close .
moment of truth comes ....
choked .

we shake hands , part as friends .
we turn around to walk away .
this little weasel shoots me in the back .

i didn' t really like stanley after that .
he took a really , really long time to die .
never get too close .

i would hate it ... ... more than mayonnaise .
you know how much i hate mayonnaise .

besides , you want janni gogolak dead .
that' s where you' re wrong .
i don' t want anybody dead .
if we don' t make janni gogolak dead , he' s gonna make you dead .
the gogolaks don' t like to leave witnesses lying around .

i changed my mind .
but if you think i should go and try to find somebody else

gotcha .
you make a noise , he gets out of bed to see what the problem is ... ... and you make him dead , okay ?

my mother' s there waiting with it .
your mother knows about this ?
my mother wants this to happen as much as i do .

i don' t usually risk my life for people that just like me .
well , i do like you .

jill told me your idea .

old charlie .
all right .
doctor ... ... these men need to see you .
excuse me .
right this way , gentlemen .
dr. oseransky , i' m sergeant buchanan .
this is officer morrissey .
yes , well , what can i do for you ?
are you the owner of a brown toyota corolla ... ... license number zsj959 ?
yes .
is there a problem ?
do you know where your vehicle is , sir ?
i lent it to my neighbor .
this neighbor ... ... he got a name ?
jimmy jones .
would you mind taking us to his place of residence ?
your car was found by the grain silo at the old port .
two bodies were inside of it .
there had been a fire .
the extent of the burns made any normal identification impossible .
so dental impressions were taken .
from the dental records , we established that the bodies ... ... were those of one janni peter gogolak ... ... and james stefan tudeski .
both of them were big shots in a chicago crime syndicate .
and you think this james ...
tudeski . ... is the jimmy i know ?
well , that' s what we intend to find out .
isn' t that hanson' s car ?
go have a look .
who' s hanson ?
one of our men .
he was on an undercover assignment .
there was some concern because he' d failed to check in this morning .
your mother knows about this ?
my mother wants this to happen as much as i do .
and i really , really want this to happen .
it' s hanson' s car , all right .
but no sign of hanson .
but i found a tape .
dr. oseransky , could you tell us where your wife might be ?
my wife ?
she' s in niagara falls with her mother .
why ?
i don' t know how to tell you this ... ... but your wife recently tried to hire a hit man to kill you .
a hit man ?
oh , my god .
there' s no smoking in here .
so where is he , mrs. oseransky ? you better have answers .
hi , mom .
ask all the questions you want , but until i speak to my attorney
you spoke to him .
he doesn' t want to have anything to do with you .
special agent hanson , mrs. oseransky .
what did you do to him ?
it wasn' t me .
we have your voice on tape .
his written reports .
you tried to hire him to kill your husband .
so what happened ?
he tried to back out ?
he tried to back out , and you killed him .
none of this would' ve happened if that girl had done her job .
what girl ?
jill !
my husband' s receptionist !
was she a contract killer too ?
yes !
i hired her !
she' s the killer !
this would be sad if it wasn' t so pathetic .
do you wanna talk to her ?
no , i don' t think so .
i don' t blame you .
you guys know a good divorce lawyer ?
she did it .
she' s a killer !
you' ve got to believe me .
i got all the i' s dotted and all the t' s crossed .
jimmy' s got his own way of spelling .
i' il take care of jimmy .
you won' t have to see him again .
while you and jill get the money , jimmy and i' il be at the museum .
jimmy at a museum ?
there' s people at a museum .
he' s not gonna try anything .
if you say so .
where' s cynthia ?
you and i are leaving .
i' il beep cynthia .
she' il call you and tell you where to go .
listen to him .
mr. cloak and dagger .
i' m being careful .
i' m a dentist .
you boys play nice , now .
take us to the art museum .
you think if cynthia doesn' t come through you' il be safe at the museum ?
hope there was nothing special you wanted to see at the museum .
why ?
we' re not going to the museum .
we' re going to the marina .
the marina ?
i rented a boat for the day .
isn' t that right , frankie ?
see ?
i' m careful too .
you' re jill ?
nice to meet you .
where' s your gun ?
what makes you think i have a gun ?
throw it in .
you have the certificates ?
let' s go banking .
everything' s in order .
where would you like the money sent ?
to a bank in the caymans .
the account number is
can we have a minute ?
certainly .
thanks .
i' il be right over there .
we could just walk away , you know ?
you and me .
with the whole 1 0 million .
so ?
what do you think ?
i think ....
i know that if we did , jimmy would kill oz .
so what ?
you' re a lucky guy .
why would you say that ?
you' re about to find out if the woman you love really loves you .
beer ?
if it was me ... ... l was in her position ... ... i' d take the money and run .
what are you betting on ?
i' m betting on love .
love for you means money for me .
and like i said before , i' d really hate to have to kill you .
when are you gonna do it ?
let' s make sure we got the money .
but you are intending to kill him ?
jimmy , listen .
he was there !
he was there when you killed janni and a cop .
now , i know you like this guy .
yeah , i do .
but he' s got to go .
and if you ain' t prepared to do it , then i' il have to
let' s not forget who you' re talking to .
jimmy tudeski may be dead ... ... but he ain' t exactly dead .
you understand ?
glad to hear it .
just drive the boat .
think about it , cynthia .
we' re talking about $5 million apiece here .
is oz worth that much to you ?
the thing is ... ... l think i love him .
you think ?
you think ?
sweetheart , for $5 million you better be damn certain .
i am .
i' m sorry ... ... but i love him .
you do ?
that' s the right answer .
you can get back here now .
we got the money .
bye bye , oz .
but
sorry , frankie .
i always liked you .
why did you kill him ?
well , i had to kill one of you .
well , then you definitely made the right decision .
but why did you have to kill him ?
well , if i didn' t kill you , frankie would have .
and he would' ve thought i' d gone soft ... ... eventually come after me and the money .
so ... ... what about me ?
put the bulk of the money into this account .
but i also want $1 million in this account ... ... under the name of dr. nicholas and mrs. cynthia oseransky .
one million ....
what ?
a wedding present from jimmy .
not that jimmy .
can we have another minute ?
certainly .
thanks .
i' il just ....
is this real ?
it' s real .
but to get the money ... ... you have to show up together and show them a marriage certificate .
jimmy' s divorcing me ?
don' t you read the papers , lady ?
jimmy tudeski' s dead .
i don' t know what to say .
when the time comes ... ... just say , " i do .
maybe i am going soft .
in the old days , i would' ve killed you .
don' t be so hard on yourself .
or ....
i don' t know .
maybe i have changed since my death .
i don' t think that' s what it is .
what do you mean ?
you love her , don' t you ?
cynthia ?
cynthia' s waiting for you .
she said you' d know where .
say hi to my widow for me , will you ?
take care of yourself .
marry me .
jimmy told you .
what ?
he didn' t , did he ?
you just ... ... wanna marry me ?
i don' t just wanna marry you .
i wanna marry you more than anyone' s wanted to marry anyone ... ... in the history of the world .
then would i be out of line if i told you ... ... that i loved you ?
and said yes ?
i would love to marry you .
so you wouldn' t mind spending the rest of your life with a poor dentist ?
something tells me we' il get by .
