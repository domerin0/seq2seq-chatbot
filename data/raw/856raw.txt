can' t be denied , can it , ted ?
i think you' re right , and if you just keep this kind of open dialogue going ,

easy f or you to say after you fuck another man' s wif e .
you should at least have the guts to stand behind ... your convictions .

happy new year .
let me speak to betty .
uh , party' s over .
she probably went home .
she lives there !
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i know her .
well , then get her on the phone .
tell her it' s an emergency .
who who should i say is calling ?
you tell her it' s teddy from work on the phone .
i got some major fucking emergency .
hi , ted .
i' m margaret .
you sound down .
has this not been the happiest of new years ?
no , margaret .
this hasn' t been my happiest new year .
this one' s starting off pretty fucking badly .
aw , how come ?
well , betty ...
leaves me here all by myself , and first thing right off the bat ,
i' m fucked by a coven of witches .
you were fucked by an oven full of witches ?
a coven of witches !
not an oven !
well , one witch in particular .
was she an old hag with a mole on her f ace with hair growing out of it ?
no , no , she was very beautiful .
ted ?
what' s the problem ?
well , admittedly , that was the best part of the evening .
it was pretty bloody good actually .
but it' s still a pretty unnerving way to start off the night .
sounds like a pretty great way to start off the night to me .
why don' t we just skip over the witches ?
skipping the witches .
right .
later , in another room , some crazy fucking maniac sticks a gun in my f ace ... and f orces me to play out some psychosexual drama with his wif e .
he made you have psycho sex with his wif e ?
no , he didn' t make me fuck his wif e .
he thought i fucked his wif e .
he held me at gunpoint with a loaded gun !
what kind of gun was it ?
i don' t know .
i' m not a gun guy .
it was big .
was it like dirty harry' s gun ?
yeah , sort of like that , yeah .
did it have a real long barrel or a short barrel ?
what diff erence does it make ?
well , f or one thing , it' s a diff erence between a . 44 magnum and a magnum . 357 .
who the fuck cares whether it was a . 44 or a . 392 ?
it was a big fucking gun !
it was loaded !
and it was pointed right at my fucking head !
you wanna skip this part too ?
i want you to get betty on the phone right fucking now .
hold on .
anybody live here named
what' s her name again ?
betty .
betty !
whatcha screaming about ?
you' re betty ?
yeah , i' m betty .
it' s my fucking place .
who the fuck are you ?
i' m margaret .
and this is ted .
you guys , wanna go to breakf ast ?

okay , ted , what' s the problem ?
hello , betty .
what' s the problem ?
i haven' t got a problem .
i' ve got fucking problems .
plural .
wanna hear ?
sure .
well , most recently , there' s room 309 .
there' s this scary mexican gangster dude pokin ' his finger in my chest .
there' s his hooligan kids snapping their fingers at me .
there' s a putrid , rotting corpse of a dead whore stuff ed in the springs of the bed .
there' s rooms blazing afire .
there' s a big f at needle from god knows where , stuck in my leg , inf ecting me with god knows what .
and finally , there' s me , walkin ' out the door right fuckin ' now .
buenas noches .
ls that the penthouse ?
yes , it is .
it' s the chester rush party .
they want something .
well , tough titty .
they' re just gonna have to whistle , because i' m off .
now , ted , wait a minute .
i know you' re freaked .
i know you' re stressed .
you had a real bad night .
oh , yes , betty .
i' ve had a real bad night .
the only thing i ask is that you take care of chester rush , and then you can leave .
i don' t f eel like it !
ted , he' s a very important guest of the hotel .
ln f act , he' s the most important guest of the hotel .
the mon signor used to be a haven f or movie stars .
through the thirties , forties and first half of the fifties , more movie stars , if you break it down on a night by night basis , stayed at the mon signor than any other hotel in hollywood .
now , we had some hard times in the eighties , even though we were the official hotel of cannon pictures , but we' re comin ' back strong in the nineties .
and a movie star clientele is important to that comeback .
now , you look here  he probably just wants some champagne .
you can do that , can' t you ?
ted .
just take care of him .
the entire staff of the mon signor is begging you .
okay .
but you get your ass down here pronto !
you' re a good man , ted .
thanks .

chill out , dude .
pay no attention to norman here .
he' s just that' s from quadrophenia .

i think of the bellboy with jerry lewis .
did you ever see that film , ted ?
um ... no , sir .
oh , you should .
it' s one of jerry' s better movies .
he doesn' t say a word through the entire film .
it' s a completely silent perf ormance .
now how many actors can pull that off ?
i gotta tell you , that guy , he' s gotta go to france to get respect .
that says it all about america right there .
just that one little sentence says it all about america right there .
the minute jerry lewis dies , every newspaper in this fuckin ' country ... is gonna be writin ' articles callin ' the man a genius .
it' s not right .
it' s not right and it' s not fuckin ' f air !
but why should that surprise anybody ?
when the hell has america ever been f air ?
we might be right every once in awhile , but we' re very rarely f air .
oh .
um ... where shall i put this , sir ?

okay , then gotta stop playin ' " beat the clock .

as long as you don' t break up the furniture ,
i don' t give a fuck what you do .
took all your money .
gonna take your kids and house .
as f ar as i' m concerned , go ahead , trash the place !
oh , but , look , let me explain what we' re talkin ' about .
sir , sir , you don' t have to explain anything to me .
whatever constitutes a good time , as f ar as you guys are concerned , that' s your business .
well , no , it' s your business too , ted , because we want you to take part .
take part in what , sir ?
chester , your way of breakin ' the news to him gently is scarin ' the fuck outta him .
think so ?
just spit it out .
okay , okay , here we go .
okay .
thing is , ted , first off , there' s nothing homosexual about what we want you to do .
i mean , i was thinkin ' you might be thinkin ' ... that we want you to do somethin ' like weird sex thing , you know , like , suck us off , pee on us , shit like that .
nothing , nothing could be further from the truth .
can i just jump in here f or a second ?
no .
no .
my kind of way of telling him is kind of going all around the world .
but it' s the journey that' s worth it .
yeah , well , i see that .
but he' s been here f or 15 minutes and you have , you know , talked about everything but
what do you care ?
why don' t you just shut the fuck up , bitch ?
" bitch " ?
bitch !
uh , excuse me , aren' t you the one who' s being paid to suck his cock , cork boy ?
whoa !
cork boy , man !
business card !
i see a new business card .
excuse me , if it please the court .
allow me to present our intentions to theodore .
i second the nomination .
i move that nomination be closed !
thank you .
the court is yours , leo .
thank you very much , chester .
ted , you ever seen any of them old alfred hitchcock episodes ?
yes , sir .
you ever see the one called the man from rio with peter lorre and steve mcqueen ?
uh  ah , if you saw it , you' d remember it .
it' s called the man from rio with peter lorre , steve mcqueen .
anyway , peter lorre makes a bet with steve mcqueen ... that steve mcqueen can' t light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row .
now , if steve mcqueen lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a row , he wins peter lorre' s new car .
but if he does not light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row ,
peter lorre gets to chop off steve mcqueen' s little pinky .
norman and chester here just made that same bet .
norman has bet his pinky ... that he can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row .
lf he does , he wins chester' s 1964 chevy chevelle ... red , fuckin ' , beautiful car .
lf he doesn' t , chop off his fuckin ' pinky .
what do you say ?
you guys are drunk .
yes !
of course !
of course we' re drunk !
teddy , that' s why we' re here , but that does not mean ... that we don' t know what the fuck we' re talking about .
i' m gonna tell you what the fuck i' m talkin ' about .
i' m gonna tell you what the fuck i' m talkin ' about .
i drive a motherfucking honda that my sister sold me .
you hear what i' m saying ?
a little white motherfuckin ' honda civic !
you see this shit ?
" hollywood' s hottest new star  that' s me . next to america' s hottest old car .
that' s the car i own .
are you listenin ' to me ?
are you ?
goddamn shit !
are you listening to me ?
now you take a good long look at that there machine ... that this motherfucker over here' s standin ' next to .
that' s a 1964 nigger red , ragtop chevy chevelle .
and i love that car more than i love hips , lips or fingertips .
we' re sittin ' here celebratin ' , gettin ' high ,
drinking champagne  drinking cristal .
when you' re drinking champagne , you' re drinking champagne .
when you' re drinking cristal , you say you' re drinking cristal .
whatever that pissity ass thing is , we are drinking it , you know .
and we are watching tv .
what , what ?
hey , hey , hey .
when all of a sudden , [ tongue clicks ]
we flip on steve mcqueen , peter lorre being fuckin ' badasses .
badass !
badasses !
and i look over at this funny looking motherfucker over here , and i say , " i' d do that f or the chevelle .
i' m funny .
and that' s when chester says
oh , really ?
well , you guys wouldn' t be doing something this stupid unless you were really fucking drunk .
we already told you we were drunk , ted .
that goes without motherfucking saying .
' cause if we wasn' t drunk , we' d probably chicken out .
when you' re fucked up , you don' t lie .
man , you tell the fuckin ' truth .
you want to know what the fuckin ' truth is ?
the fuckin ' truth is , my lucky zippo is gonna win me ...
chester' s fucking car .
which brings us to your part in this little wager , ted .
i don' t have a part , sir .
that' s it .
like my old granddaddy used to always say ,
the less a man makes declarative statements , the less apt he is to look f oolish in retrospect .
that' s quite brilliant , sir .
ah , thank you , thank you , thank you .
thing is , there are some inherent obstacles in this undertaking .
aside from the obvious .
first of which is being the f act that i' m not like peter lorre on that tv show .
i' m not some sick fuck travelin ' the countryside collecting fingers .
all right , you know , we' re all buddies here .
no one wants norman to lose his finger .
we just want to chop it off .
you know , if f ate doesn' t smile on old norman , we' il put that fucker on ice , whisk it right to the hospital , where in all likelihood they' il be able to sew it right back on .
well , hopefully , sir .
yeah , well , they sewed that guy' s dick back on .
they can sew norman' s pinky back on .
yeah , how hard can it be ?
yeah , good point .
so , norman , he' s , he' s taken care of , you know .
his interests have been looked after .
my interests , on the other hand , have not .
i am as emotionally attached to my car as norman is physically to his finger .
that' s a very fuckin ' piece of expensive machinery i' m putting on this wager .
and , you know , if i lose , i lose .
that' s fine .
that' s no problem .
i have no problem with that .
i' m a big boy .
i knew exactly what the hell i was doing .
but if i win , i wanna win .
all right ?
lf norman lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a fuckin ' row , he' s gonna have no emotional problems whatsoever about taking my car keys .
but if i win , well , it' s not inconceivable that at the last minute ... maybe neither leo or i ... will be able to ... wield the axe .
a hatchet , sir .
wield the hatchet .
which brings us full circle to you , ted .
clear eyed ted .
sober ted .
complete stranger ted .
lmpartial ted .
just met us and couldn' t give a fuck about us ted .
we want you to be the dice man .
hell of a night , huh , ted ?
i' ve got to get out of here .
money !
ted , i got a $100 bill here with your name on it , whether you do what we ask or not .
just to sit back down in that chair f or one minute more .
i am not gonna cut off norman' s little pinky !
well , maybe you will and maybe you won' t .
but that has nothin ' to do with this $100 bill in my hand .
ln f act , you can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that goddamn door .
but if you wait 60 seconds bef ore you do it , you' re gonna be $100 richer .
ted , you' re gonna do whatever you wanna do .
all we' re askin ' is that you indulge us f or one minute more .
my friend chester here is willing to pay you f or that minute .
ted , take the money .
now , let me get this straight .
i sit on that stool , listen to what you have to say f or 60 seconds ,
and i get $100 ?
correct .
and afterwards i can walk out that door , no hard f eelings ?
none whatsoever .
you got a deal .
yes !
oh , yes , yes !
yes , yes , yes , !
ted , good answer .
sit right down .
all right .
leo , you be the timekeeper .
norman , give me your watch .
let me know when a minute ends and when it begins .
you got it .
ah .
okay .
gentlemen , start your engines .
begin .
okay , ted , pay attention here .
i' m gonna make two piles here on the bar .
one pile which is yours .
and another pile which could be yours .
and what you have to realize is we' re gonna do this thing ... one way or the other .
whether it' s you who holds the axe or a mexican maid ... or some bum we yank off the street .
you can buy a whole lot of soup with that pile .
shh !
i' m the closer here .
all right .
i' m a little me um , i' ve lost count .
how much is on the bar here ?
six hundred .
okay .
ted , do you know how long it takes the average american to count to 600 ?
it' s a rhetorical question , ted .
no , sir .
about one minute less than it takes to count to 700 .
now , ted , a person' s lif e is filled with a zillion little experiences .
some which are insignificant , have no meaning , and , you know , you f orget them .
others which you remember f or the rest of your natural lif e .
now , since what we' re proposing here is so unusual , so outside the norm , that this is a good bet that this is going to be one of those incidents that sticks .
so , since you' re gonna be stuck remembering this f or the rest of your lif e , you have to decide what that memory will be .
so , ted , are you going to remember f or the next 40 years , give or take a decade , that you refused $1, 000 f or one second' s worth of work ?
or that you made $1, 000 f or one second' s worth of work ?
time !
so , ted , what' s it gonna be ?
okay .
yes !
always be closing !
whoo !
right here , right now !
bef ore i change my mind !
hear , hear .
go .
let' s go .
get this shit over and done with .
ahh !
perf ect , perf ect , perf ect .
this is one of those moments in time ... none of us are ever gonna f orget .
norman , are you ready ?
i' m ready .
ted , are you ready ?
ready .
okeydokey .
norman ... begin .
aaah !
my finger !
my fuckin ' finger !
chester , my fuckin ' finger , man !
he cut off my fuckin ' finger !
oh !
it hurts !
my fuckin ' finger , chester !
he cut off my fuckin ' finger !
aaah !
