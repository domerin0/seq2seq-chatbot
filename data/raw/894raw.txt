sometimes , when i' m driving or walking , i see a man in a corner .
he' s just standing there , looking .
when he notices he' s being observed , he becomes embarrassed .
on bus stops you can also see ordinary people ... just standing there , looking .
what are they thinking about ?
what are they looking for ?
the past , maybe ?
on september 26 , 1998 , i observed one of these men .
but this time it was different .
that man was me .
it was my last moment as someone afraid to commit .
that was when i got rid of the curse and i finally grew up .
in the mid eighties , i shared with my second girlfriend my first flat .
when she asked me ...
do you love me ?
i answered ...
i do .
but i wasn' t sure .
later , when my future fiance asked ...
where were you on november 9 , 1989 ?
i answered ...
i was near the berlin wall !
but it wasn' t true .
that night , i was in bed with a woman , watching a video .
he feels as if his muscles are relaxed and goes limp again .
sometimes life was nice ; other times , it was shitty .
a pile of shit indeed .
somewhere along the line , i learned how to play .
i learned to fuck , to love and to lie .
it was like that for years .
but now i had turned 30 , and it was time .
either i have this baby or it' s over .
you can' t be serious .
i am !
i loved her .
i didn' t want any other .
i had no reason to run away .
i even wanted to have a child .
why was i running away ?
i didn' t know why .
but suddenly , i realized that ...
i need to go away for a few days .
where to ?
i need to go to berlin .
berlin ?
i' d like to know since when you are so afraid of commitment .
helmut , this is serious !
i wish i knew too .
learnlng to lle " i never told this to anybody .
it all began in 1982 .
i was 18, and i saw my father dancing alone in the basement .
where' s your father ?
he' s coming .
helmut !
hi , uncle bertram .
sit down .
i' m worried about you .
about me ?
why ?
you know the russians are practically on our doorstep .
they' re in thuringia , in saxony , right under our noses .
some youths let the russians do whatever they want .
so , have you been to one of these demonstrations ?
no .
good !
i hope you stay that way !
what about girlfriends ?
have you got any ?
no , but i' m trying .
great !
dear students .
the election will be held the following way : ... two committees .
committee a ...
new . ... and b. it' s worthless !
the committees will present their platforms .
then the election will be held .
it' s a secret ballot .
now that everyone is finally here ... we may begin .
please .
dear fellow students !
modern civilization has the means to destroy itself 100 times .
why doesn' t the west take the first step ... towards a world without nuclear weapons ... giving up the pershing ii and cruise missiles ?
species diversity is dropping .
acid rain is destroying our forests .
and then there is the so called peaceful use of nuclear power ... but harrisburg was only the beginning .
next time it could happen in biblis or krmmel .
we cannot stick our heads in the sand !
which is , by the way , full of cadmium .
if i win the election , i' il back the formation of groups of students ... to address these problems .
but it' s clear that , whatever i do ... the initiative should come from you .
what are these ?
they re selections .
this is the first one .
it' s called " the trip " .
no , this one !
it' s kansas .
dust in the wind " .
exactly . you can take that and go sit among the girls .
isn' t that the whole idea ?
not yet .
we ain' t even out of town .
too soon for that sentimental bullshit .
gotta build up an atmosphere .
i think it' s perfect .
you' d play " when i' m 64 " on your grandmother' s 64th birthday .
and when we arrive in berlin , i bet you' il play ...
berlin " , by fischer z !
it goes well with the occasion .
that' s what music' s for !
schfer , you just don' t get it !
hi , girls .
hi .
i' d like to congratulate you .
what for ?
i voted for you .
you' re congratulating me for that ?
no .
because you won .
thanks .
my friend would also like to congratulate you .
hi .
hi .
very kind of you to come here to congratulate me .
don' t mention it .
that' s nice , but we' re talking here .
excuse me .
was that great or what ?
what' s going on between you two ?
nothing .
liar .
i saw the way she looked at you .
there' s nothing going on .
honest .
we' il reach west berlin soon , right ?
come on , guys !
on the bus !
good afternoon .
please let me see your left ear .
see you later .
hey .
hey .
strange sensation , isn' t it ?
yeah .
hey , guys , listen up .
it' s 3 : 15 now .
you may do whatever you want for a while .
i' il see you guys at 6 : 00 at the friedrichstrasse station .
i' m thirsty .
wanna drink something ?
hermes , where are you going ?
we' re gonna drink something .
see you later .
here is fine .
tell me ... after high school , what will you do ?
i was thinking of maybe ... joining the peace corps .
i' d like to do something significant .
what about you ?
what' il you do ?
maybe i' il get into politics .
well ... here it is .
thanks .
1 . 22 , please .
let me pay .
thank you .
sorry , i don' t have any change .
well , then ... bring us eight more beers .
i' m paying in advance .
cheers .
when they start doing song requests , it' s a bad sign .
lack of sensibility .
a dj' s best nights are those without any song requests .
but nobody s dancing .
i won' t play commercial songs .
i' il make them dance .
hey , play " words " !
i' il go fetch a beer .
" words don' t come easy " .
i haven' t got that one .
do you also like berlin ?
i like it , of course .
i wish i didn' t have to go back .
i think i' il go to college here .
and what will you major in ?
medicine .
my brother studied medicine here .
i can' t believe they want to listen to this crap !
i wanna live by the wall .
in kreuzberg , somewhere like that .
something simple , in a backyard .
a whole room to myself .
can i have a sip of your beer ?
actually , i don' t even like beer .
it' s very easy to talk to you .
you think so ?
excuse me a moment .
hey .
hey .
i had fun this afternoon .
me too .
we should do that again .
days later , helmut kohl was elected chancellor .
for britta , it was a tragedy .
i became a member of the same groups she went to .
the ecological , the anti bomb and the nicaraguan studies groups .
he' s the illegitimate son of a wealthy spanish land owner .
and one of the sandino family s employees .
and even though his father was wealthy ...
now you' re well acquainted with the material , aren' t you ?
i am .
would you help me prepare a pamphlet for action week ?
of course .
then come to my house tomorrow and we' il begin to prepare it .
you mean ... at your place ?
yeah .
i' il write down directions .
it' s kinda difficult to find .
how about 4 pm ?
hi , are you helmut ?
exactly .
i' m jutta , britta' s mom .
come in .
hi .
britta is upstairs .
in her " space " .
turn left , it' s the shortest way up .
thanks .
hi .
hi .
i' ve got something for you .
journey to ixtlan " , by castaeda .
you' il like it .
you can keep it .
really ?
of course .
when you finish it , tell me what you think .
thanks .
i thought your mom' s name was jutta , not brigitte .
brigitte is my dad' s ex girlfriend .
my biological father' s .
does he live here too ?
of course not , silly .
in san francisco .
sit down .
problem is , people think ... that the americans defeated hitler .
didn' t they ?
they did , but with the help of the red army .
people forget .
besides , as ortega pointed out recently ... the usa were in bed with enemies of democracy several times .
could you pass me that ?
of course .
like in nicaragua and with argentinean fascists .
are you listening to me ?
yes , i' m listening .
the usa couldn' t care less about upholding democratic values .
they spring into action when ... they feel they re losing control .
we need to get back to work .
let' s begin again .
we shouldn' t go too far on our first time .
besides , i' m having my period .
you' re so cute when you blush like that .
i' m cold .
will you keep me warm ?
good morning .
what were you thinking ?
what do you mean ?
good morning .
good morning .
your father talked to you yet ?
how could that happen ?
what ?
me talking to dad ?
kid , we were worried sick !
you could have called .
big deal !
i was an hour late !
what if some day i really do something ?
will you send me to an orphanage ?
don' t take that tone with me !
this is no joke .
you know what happened to mrs. heinemann' s boy .
he' s been unemployed since he was released from jail .
god , mom !
i haven' t even finished high school yet !
helmut !
kid ...
i really would like to know what' s on your mind .
have you masturbated yet ?
this is the first piece of shit i hold today !
what' s gotten into you ?
nothing .
great day today .
it' s a day like any other .
been drinking , by any chance ?
nope .
i' ve got biology .
see you .
hi .
hi .
let' s go .
hi .
how are you ?
fine .
hi .
hi .
i like it here a lot .
me too .
i' d never been here before .
really ?
really .
you' re probably wondering why i called you .
it was very nice last night , with you .
last night , you know ?
i know .
have you told anyone ?
about what ?
about last night .
no .
good .
i' d rather you don' t , okay ?
no , i really liked it .
it' s just that , as student body president , i' m under scrutiny .
and i want to keep what we have only between us .
do you understand ?
of course .
i don' t want anyone talking about us .
and ... if you don' t tell anyone ... there' s still a lot of things i want to do with you .
agreed ?
agreed .
we' d act like strangers at school , then get together in the afternoon .
nobody knew about britta and me .
sometimes , i wanted to tell somebody , but i couldn' t .
mcke thought i was acting kinda strange , and he said ...
you' re acting kinda strange .
i almost didn' t see him anymore .
nobody found out about us .
are you going away for christmas ?
no , we always stay here .
i think christmas sucks .
it' s not a religious date anymore , just a consumerism festival .
jutta and wilfred always have some friends over ... and we throw a nice party .
you can come too , if you want .
i need to ask my parents .
they certainly won' t mind .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
is this fun or what ?
i' m gonna have to go out shortly .
what ?
i' m gonna have to go out shortly .
what do you mean , you have to go out ?
some folks from the student body are giving a party and i want to go .
tonight ?
on christmas ' eve ?
but we' re in the middle of a conversation here .
may i go ?
it was very kind of you to ask .
hi .
britta ?
you' re crazy .
look inside .
to britta , from h.
you' re really crazy .
did you like it ?
of course i liked it .
are you kidding ?
but you shouldn' t have done that .
why not ?
it must have costed a lot .
money is no problem .
you' re so sweet .
i' m going to the us .
i' il go with you .
no , i' m really going ... to live with my dad in san francisco .
i' m leaving next week .
but school starts next week .
exactly .
i' il study there .
what ?
for a year .
i' il finish high school there .
i could save up and visit you on easter .
yeah , right .
why not ?
listen , a year is a very long time .
you' il probably meet someone .
no .
then maybe i' il meet someone .
do you want to meet another guy ?
i didn' t say that .
i just said that a year is a very long time .
i think you should go away .
i won' t be able to sleep now .
i' il write .
i love you , britta .
see you .
darling britta .
we haven' t written to each other in a while , and maybe i changed .
gone is the time when i' d write you five letters a week .
four years later
i stayed in west germany ... and i' m studying german , history and political sciences .
oddly enough , i kinda like it .
i' ve made some new friends .
one of them is called ...
beck .
i was sad when i knew about your american boyfriend ... because i haven' t seen you anymore ... because you stayed there and you never came back to germany .
but i remember your arms and your legs .
i remember your hands and your eyes .
i' il never forget how we slept together ... on christmas night , among books and candles .
helmut ?
yes .
helmut hermes .
you haven' t changed a bit .
i' d like to see you again .
forever yours , helmut .
i' ve bumped into gisela schmidtkowsky yesterday .
she didn' t go to berlin .
she stayed and went to medical school .
great .
doctors are always needed .
do you keep in touch with anyone from high school ?
steffi hanisch is my neighbor .
and i ran into wiebke hellers last week .
that' s about it .
i was really sorry about schfer .
i hardly knew him , but you were very close friends , right ?
what about schfer ?
didn' t you know ?
i haven' t heard from anybody .
not even mcke kuwelko .
i don' t even know where that big dope lives !
sorry .
you' ve got a beautiful laughter .
my god , i' ve had too much wine !
you' re beautiful even without wine .
i only drink a glass once in a while .
you drank from my beer in berlin .
but only because it was yours .
well ... what about schfer ?
he died .
what ?
he died in a car accident two years ago .
i thought you knew .
i never knew .
shall we ask for our check ?
yes , better .
the check , please .
what ?
do you hear that ?
schfer still rules .
i' il pay .
good evening .
good evening .
hi .
this is rdiger and barbara .
they live here with me .
my name is helmut .
good evening .
do you want a coffee ?
good night .
well ... good night , then .
good night .
good night .
good morning , chief .
don' t try to socialize .
you' ve been here for weeks doing nothing .
it' s your turn at the sink .
okay .
i need a job .
anything in particular ?
whatever .
you got something for me ?
we' il see .
i became a parking clerk .
they didn' t pay me a lot , but it was easy .
i spent the whole day sitting in the booth , not doing much .
i began to study in earnest out of pure boredom .
with gisela , everything was fine .
i liked to look at her and i liked it when she' d stroke me .
we didn' t fight and , most of the time , we had the same opinion .
in bed , she was different from britta .
she didn' t mind trying new things ... but she didn' t have any ideas of her own .
however , gisela had definite ideas about other things .
i' m looking forward to our first christmas together .
on the 24th , we' re gonna visit your parents .
then we' il introduce you to mine and we' il have dinner with them .
on the 25th , we' re gonna visit my aunt annie .
she' s dying to meet you .
on the 26th , we' il go to the nursing home to see my uncle zikowicz .
he' s not my real uncle .
he' s a friend of my grandpa' s who used to take care of me .
and the afternoon of the 26th is all ours , just to ourselves .
but we' re gonna have to prepare some things .
i' ve invited a few people over for dinner .
you can bring someone too .
maybe that guy beck .
do you guys really skin corpses ?
we skin them so we can see the muscles .
each one of us is assigned a different body part .
last time , i got a penis .
must' ve been interesting .
i' d like to work for the district attorney .
my god .
who are those revolting people ?
friends of gisela' s .
let' s hide in here .
is this gisela' s room ?
no , this is barbara' s .
her roommate .
she' s away for christmas .
are you a pervert ?
why ?
you' re going through a stranger' s drawers .
not a stranger .
she lives here .
oh , that changes everything .
let' s go somewhere else .
we' re entertaining .
gisela is entertaining .
two more !
and two beers .
i' il be right back .
tell me , uwe , do you remember that girl ?
what girl ?
the one who was the student body president .
blonde .
she lived far away , in a farmhouse .
i think her stepfather was a sculptor .
what was her name ?
i think it was britta .
yes , britta .
she vanished .
have you got news about her ?
no , that' s why i' m asking .
last thing i knew , she moved to berlin .
but it was a long time ago .
she was cute .
see ?
every christmas , he gets drunk at that table .
15 years ago , he had a great night over there with his first girlfriend .
this place is full of people like him .
but he got it all wrong .
it wasn' t about the girl .
what was it about , then ?
god .
what ?
when he was there with his first girlfriend ... on that christmas , 15 years ago ... he had a divine moment .
they happen .
they don' t happen very often , but they happen .
everything was perfect .
it was just his moment .
the girl just happened to be there .
he didn' t understand that .
tragic , but men are like that .
it' s all about them .
where did we stop ?
cheers .
cheers , man .
i heard you come in .
shit .
what' s the deal with the panties ?
what panties ?
you had a pair of barbara' s panties wrapped around your penis .
what are you talking about ?
excuse me , gotta use the bathroom !
thanks .
good morning .
good morning , barbara .
are you back already ?
one day s vacation is enough .
presents , cookies , children with their eyes sparkling .
all that makes me sick .
i' m going downstairs .
have you got laundry ?
i do , hang on .
what were you thinking ?
i was drunk .
you still working at the theater ?
i am .
and what' s that like ?
okay .
gisela and i soon made up .
but we almost didn' t fuck anymore .
sometimes my mom asked me to bring " that nice girlfriend of mine " over .
but i never told that to gisela .
i began to bump into barbara .
barbara !
wanna have a coffee ?
i think what you do is really cool .
how would you know ?
i imagine it is .
it' s a load of shit .
a huge load of shit .
then why do you work there ?
that' s what i always ask myself .
what' s so bad about it ?
everything .
the stress , the lies .
it looks interesting to me .
not if you' re on the inside .
who' s the whiskey for ?
for me .
here you go .
i want to sleep with you .
now ?
in the weekend , when gisela isn' t home .
saturday i' il have time .
in the afternoon .
okay .
the check , please .
yes ?
hi .
what is it ?
well , are you still up for it ?
our fuck .
you said you' d have time today .
now ?
yeah .
okay .
whenever gisela wasn' t home , barbara and i would have sex .
i can' t say i enjoyed it .
it wasn' t great , but we didn' t care .
that' s it .
that' s what i liked about it .
now i knew the difference between making love and fucking .
fucking is like a box fight gone out of control .
you bleed .
it' s repulsive .
it should be stopped .
but it' s exciting .
and totally irrelevant .
this is the 1st german network with the news .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
the polls confirmed the coalition government headed by helmut kohl .
after four difficult years ... the constituents renewed our coalition government' s mandate .
hi !
helmut , are you there ?
helmut ?
have you seen helmut ... ?
why did you do it ?
we' d better split up .
if you think so .
that' s all you have to say ?
what do you want me to say ?
maybe you' d care to explain .
explain what ?
how could that happen .
it just happened .
do you love her ?
no .
what about me ?
i don' t know .
nothing else ?
is that all ?
i don' t want you here even for one night more .
i found a little apartment .
i spent a whole year holed up in there , just watching tv .
the diplomatic mission from west germany ... was rushed today by several east berliners ... seeking permission to go to the west side .
they waited in vain .
we' re closed right now .
seek information in the media .
east berlin manifested its hope for a stable relationship .
haven' t you got any change ?
i don' t , i' m sorry .
i don' t have change for this .
you could say " keep the change " .
should i stay here until i' ve used up 500 marks ... or shall we have a coffee ?
doing nothing .
that' s the secret .
that' s how you meet the most incredible women .
what do you do for a living ?
i' m a sports writer .
cool .
i' m gloria .
tell me about you .
tell you what ?
everything .
britta would be impressed seeing me with someone like her .
hello ?
helmut !
something awful happened !
what ?
what was your uncle like ?
he was a smelly , inconvenient bastard .
a hypocritical , oppressive son of a bitch .
but it was your uncle .
great uncle .
still , he was a jerk .
have you ever told him that ?
of course not .
that' s a shame .
so you' re our son' s girlfriend .
what' s your profession ?
i' m a sports writer .
right .
a cognac , please .
yes , ma' am .
are you serious ?
i need cognac to get me through funerals .
but it isn' t even noon yet !
so what ?
double , please .
what exactly does that mean ?
what ?
excuse me .
how dare she show up dressed like that ?
uncle bertram would have approved , the leery bastard .
don' t talk about him like that !
don' t talk ...
and on his funeral ! ... about my girlfriend like that !
kid , sometimes ...
sometimes you could know what i want for a change , right ?
you' ve changed , son .
i almost don' t recognize you .
are you waiting to be interviewed by professor mutter ?
what is history ?
describing what has really happened .
that' s historiography .
at least according to l. von ranke ... whose work you should know by heart .
you , with the skirt , what do you say ?
history is ... the facts .
even grammatically that' s nonsense .
now you .
history is ... the representation ... no , the course ... ... of past events .
are you serious ?
what' ve you got to say about that ?
nothing .
why ?
you can' t explain in a sentence what others couldn' t explain in volumes .
besides , i find theoretical discussions tiresome .
the job is yours .
the others may go .
fascist .
the eighties were coming to an end .
on that autumn , it looked like nothing was ever gonna change .
lift your head up , like that .
you' il feel more free .
as if nothing relevant was ever gonna happen .
what' s got into you today ?
what do you mean ?
you barely have opened your mouth all day .
i' m tired .
i' ve been real busy this week .
press " pause " .
then my friend mcke called from berlin to say ...
they' ve opened the border !
what ?
and then he went on ...
i saw britta !
i met her at a party last night !
the brandenburg gate , the symbol of berlin' s division ...
bad news ?
no , why ?
you' re all white .
they tore down the wall . ...
november 9th ...
so i' ve heard .
the ddr has declared the border open to anyone .
the gates are open .
more melon ?
yes .
helmut , you rascal !
i don' t believe it !
come in !
what are you doing here ?
tell me about her tits .
tell you what ?
she' s got two .
but what do they look like ?
do they sag to her knees , or what ?
she' s 41 .
therefore , it' s a plausible question .
here you go .
thanks .
bye .
yes ?
two kebabs , please .
with sauce ?
with everything .
spice them up .
not too spicy for me .
are you gay ?
put spice on both , we want everything you' ve got .
right away .
why have you come to berlin ?
the army .
so they wouldn' t recruit me .
you ?
i' ve been transferred .
so ?
i don' t have any idea .
i thought you' d dodge the draft .
why ?
you were so bent on all that peace bullshit .
and i thought you were eager to be in the war .
you were wrong .
but a little crossfire could' ve been fun .
however , obeying orders all the time ...
no , thanks .
why haven' t you gone against it ?
to clean up weirdo s ' asses isn' t exactly my dream .
thanks .
thanks .
and now ?
do you work with car sales ?
but not the way you' re thinking .
i' m a respectable salesman .
in a suit and a tie .
actually , i' m quite good at it .
have you seen britta ?
i knew you' d ask about her .
it' s not that serious .
you got her phone number ?
no .
we just exchanged a few words .
but it shouldn' t be difficult to find her .
in a city this size ?
no .
i know where she' il be tonight .
well , where she' il probably be .
hi , helmut .
hi , britta .
did you come here by yourself ?
no , i' m with mcke .
mcke is here too ?
he is .
but i seem to have lost him .
let' s go outside for a while .
let' s go .
i' m going .
i' m sick and tired of your rude bullshit .
i' m through .
let me go .
was that your boyfriend ?
he' s an asshole .
what have you been up to , all these years ?
i' ve been to bed early .
and i' ve been working at college .
for professor mutter .
what about you ?
i' m living in berlin .
have you got a job ?
of course .
what kind of a job ?
why do you want to know all that ?
no reason .
do you know of any place where i can sleep tonight ?
mcke' s gone , and i don' t know anyone else here .
get up .
i' il open the wine .
is this your home ?
something wrong ?
no , i just thought that ...
it' s not a farmhouse .
more or less .
i grew tired of those old farmhouses .
i never wanna see another damn farmhouse in my life .
here .
cheers .
welcome to berlin .
it' s exciting here , isn' t it ?
mcke has changed a lot .
i' ve lost contact with everybody from our old gang .
what about you ?
i' m tired .
tomorrow we' il talk more .
okay .
have you still got that ring ?
what ring ?
the one i gave you for christmas once .
you did ?
why didn' t you get in touch ?
what about you ?
you did ?
yes .
no .
but i know where she' il be tonight .
you haven' t got the hots for her still , have you ?
no , i' m fine .
you don' t fool me .
she was the love of your life .
and your first fuck .
you don' t forget something like that .
i didn' t .
how do you know ?
she told me .
we had something going at the time too .
britta was a little fox .
god !
what do you mean ?
you know i fucked her too , don' t you ?
what ?
you didn' t think she was in love with you , did you ?
shit , i thought you already knew .
no .
i went straight home and i tried to forget britta .
the nlnetles the nineties came , and she vanished .
i didn' t have a lot of girlfriends in the 4 or 5 following years .
i had occasional sex , of course .
sometimes , things even looked promising .
but i got tired of the same old game .
to feign interest , to make clever remarks ... about women' s personalities ... to know how to listen , to be charming without being insistent .
to tell the same old jokes about the mess in my apartment .
i couldn' t take it anymore .
for me , it was enough .
i wanted someone who was independent , who challenged me ... someone unimpressed by transparent lies .
and then i found her .
where were you on november 9 , 1989 ?
i was near the berlin wall !
come on , don' t lie to me !
tina was the first who made me think about going steady in a long time .
after 2 years , we moved in together .
soon , we began talking about kids .
who got her pregnant this time ?
another guy .
that dieter dude .
he went to the movies with us .
the idiot ?
yes .
i told her .
he' s such a huge bastard .
a phony .
a painter without a shred of artistic value .
can' t she see that ?
she agreed with you , didn' t she ?
yes , but she didn' t mind .
how could she not mind ?
they re not even together .
but what can i say ?
she wants to have a kid so much .
what do you think about kids ?
i know they exist , and i know how you make them .
can you imagine yourself having your own kids some day ?
with you , yes .
must be quite a surprise .
your mother has met someone else .
your father understands that it' s all over .
your father will live here for a while .
your mother is going to move .
was this " candid camera " ?
when ?
tomorrow .
it never went through my head ... that " mother and father " could mean people with a life of their own .
people with their own passions and desires .
what was ever the same was now changed .
that scared me .
things , all of a sudden , seemed serious .
hi !
guess what !
i saved a porcupine .
it was all tangled up in the middle of the road .
i almost couldn' t avoid hitting it .
it was so scared .
i wasn' t the only one who almost killed it , i bet .
then i stopped .
i took off my jacket , i walked towards it ... and i gently picked it up and put it on the grass .
near the graveyard .
i hadn' t seen a porcupine since i was a kid .
what' s the matter with you ?
my parents are getting a divorce .
what ?
it' s true .
you gotta decide about our relationship .
either i have this baby or it' s over .
you can' t be serious .
i am !
i loved her .
i didn' t want any other .
i had no reason to run away .
i even wanted to have a child .
why was i running away ?
i didn' t know why .
but suddenly , i realized that i had a last thing to do .
right away .
hello .
hi , britta .
helmut , it s been ages !
why don' t we get together ?
how about tomorrow , 9 pm , at the letzten instanz ?
i' m sorry , the terrace is closed .
would you like to come in ?
what' il it be ?
eight beers , please .
all at once ?
if possible .
well ...
your eight beers .
enjoy .
thanks .
you' ve reached britta prinz .
leave your ...
thanks .
excuse me , sir .
can you take a picture of us ?
you haven' t changed a bit .
i' ve already ordered .
i' m sorry i' m so late .
if i had your number , i would have called you .
i left my cell phone at home .
right .
it was stupid of me , but it' s nice not being bothered for a whole day .
and we did just fine without it , right ?
that' s true .
white wine , dry .
okay .
well , so ?
are you married ?
any kids ?
me ?
no , i ...
but you' ve got a girlfriend , right ?
no .
yes .
i mean ... ... i m not sure .
seems complicated .
well , it is .
what' s the matter ?
you don' t love her anymore ?
i do !
that' s not it .
i think i' m the problem .
why ?
i was an asshole .
so she doesn' t love you anymore .
you think so ?
i don' t know her , but an asshole is not what women look for .
do i know her ?
i don' t think so .
tina kallmann ?
she' s a tax consultant .
self employed .
doesn' t sound very exciting .
but actually ... actually , she' s very ...
exciting .
yes .
among other things .
sometimes she looks down as if she was saying ...
i know how you feel .
i felt lost too , here .
or when i say something stupid , she doesn' t frown , she indulges me .
she' s got a beautiful laughter .
she' s not particularly different , but ... sincere .
she' s not fake .
i think that' s it , she' s not fake .
and i screwed it all up .
what did you do ?
i ran away and i came here .
i thought i needed to see you again .
and then you came through that door ... and i looked at you , and ... well ...
you' re just like any other person .
excuse me .
it was nice seeing you .
can you pay that for me ?
tina ?
tina , i had to tell you the whole story .
in that moment , all of a sudden , everything became clear .
i didn' t have any doubts , there was only you .
i know i' ve screwed up .
but i want this chance ... because of one thing ...
i am certain .
i love you , tina .
you are really something , helmut .
the end
