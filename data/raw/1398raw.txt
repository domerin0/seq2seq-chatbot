what' s more ?
totoro' s gift !
i was a fantastic , too .
it was a bamboo leaf package , wied with a dragon' s whisker .
when we got home , we opened it and inside were nuts .
if our garden became a forest , it would be beautiful , so we planted them .
but they just won' t grow .
every day , mei says
' still nothing , there' s still nothing ' .
she' s just like the crab of the monkey crab fable .
it will soon be summer vacation .
please hurry and get well .
satsuki .
