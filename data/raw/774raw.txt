hi , grant .
thank you , mark .

l' m ...
okay , i' m not really easy , but ...
i' il shut up , because i don' t know what i' m saying .
l have wanted to ask you out for a long time .
but i was a little intimidated .
because of my father ?
no , because you' re easy .
l' m just going off what you said .
looks like liberty found herself a good one this time .
l hate first dates .
too painful .
for you or the girl ?
all i want is to love and be loved , morales .
hi .
hi .
would you like to take a picture ?
that would be great .
okay .
come here .

how can you stand to have people ... ... staring at you all the time ?
it' s part of the job description .
after six years in the white house ... ... and eight as the governor' s daughter , i don' t really know anything else .
l think you' d get all this attention if you weren' t the first daughter .
yeah .
you look good in that blouse .
you should wear that more often .
actually , it' s a sweater .
sweater , blouse , you wear it well .
take a compliment .
have you heard from rhode island ?
i got in .
congratulations .
l knew you would .
my parents are pushing premed .
l think parents want you to appreciate the good things in life , but not do them .
they want you to see art ...
we got something at 9 : 00 .
but not make art .
they want you to have love , find love and value love ... ... but not make love , ever .
thought i' d make this night more memorable .
he' s reaching .
go !
what are you guys doing ?
wait , these are my friends .
you don' t know what you' re doing !
get off me !
this street is off limits .
it' s only a camera .
okay , folks , it' s over .
clear the street .
l' m so sorry .
i should wait for them .
no , come on , it' s still early .
we could go catch a movie or something .
anna ... ... you are really great .
but this is just way too out of control for me .
l' m sorry .
of course you can kiss me .
weiss to control .
returning home with liberty .
good night .
poor kid .
all right , well , at least she' s home safe .
how about i get you home safe ?
how about i call you when i get there ?

you' re not gonna call me , are you ?

i need to talk to him .
i can' t let you in there , anna .
anna , wait .
go on .
l' m not going .
dad .
way to go .
l can' t believe you had that restaurant swarming ... ... with your secret servants .
you ruined my date !
and now i' m gonna die before i ever get to third base .
l mean second base .
anna ?
talk to you about this later .
no .
no , stay .
pull up a chair .
we' re just discussing the g8 summit in prague .
how to persuade the eu to adopt our plan to give humanitarian aid ... ... and medical technology to developing nations .
but you had a bad date ... ... so we should probably focus on that .
no , i' m so sorry to have interrupted .
excuse me .
so third base is what again ?
i always thought it was below the waist .
i don' t remember , sir .
maybe that was just cheerleaders .
glad i asked .
anna ... ... i know that dating is a little more difficult for you .
try " impossible .
and you know that the extra security is necessary .
they ruined her date .
she really likes this boy .
oh , okay .
a boy who ranks 24th in his class , plays xbox two hours a day ... ... and wants to go to art school .
who told you that ?
phil .
okay , i don' t want some guy ... ... who wears his sunglasses inside at night ...
sorry , phil .
listening in on my dinner dates .
that is such a total abuse of power .
l am 18 years old and i wanna go out on a date without guys in bad suits ...
sorry , harper .
hiding behind every tree .
nothing is private .
sweetie , i am just trying to protect you .
dad , i' m not that 12 year old girl who would only dance with you at your inaugural ball .
you' re right .
excuse me , sir .
it' s the vice president on the phone .
he says it' s urgent .
dad .
you can make it up to me when we' re in prague .
we' il see .
remember gabrielle le clerc ?
french ambassador' s daughter .
she' il be in prague and she' s invited me to this concert .

one agent .
thank you , mom .
yeah , one agent .

weiss and morales .
final offer .
just weiss and morales , promise ?
never ask a president to promise , honey .
l' m not .
l' m asking my dad .
promise ?
promise .
later , maybe we can talk about me leaving prague to go to the berlin love parade .
forget it .
l' ve been reading about it ... ... and it' s basically one big peace rally .
no , it' s basically an orgy .
it' s not going to happen , anna .
the answer' s no .
sir , vice president .
still waiting .
president .
still president .

it' s been busy for america' s first family in prague ... ... during this g8 summit week .
first daughter anna foster took a carriage ride with the mayor of prague and his wife .
after a press conference , a tour of the air force museum ... ... with the minister of culture , then a caricature on charles bridge ... ... a photo op with high school students at prague castle ... ... and even a few moments entertaining children at the prague marionette theater .
it seems anna foster' s diplomatic skills ... ... are on the way to matching those of her father , president foster .
the day ended with a presidential banquet at the national museum .
anna .
gabrielle !
how are you ?
good .
gabrielle ?
l' m sorry i am late ... ... but the guards outside took turns to search me .
gabrielle , you' re all grown up .
it happens .
what' s that in your mouth , candy ?
no , it' s pierced .
you like it ?
no .
remind me to commission a study and find out ... ... why on earth anyone wants to pierce their tongue .
l' il save your country' s money .
see , some guys think it makes for better ...
gabrielle , let' s go mingle over here .
she' s a nice girl .
wonder what else she has pierced .
oh , relax , jim .
how should i relax ?
set up an embargo .
you love those .
have you been smoking ?
l had a cigar with the prime minister .
it' s rude if you don' t .
l love champagne .
yes , and 18 is okay in europe , so ...
i don' t believe they' re still following you .
go away , men with guns .
it' s no good .
l' ve tried .
even in english , they don' t get it .
l don' t know how you stand it .
l got rid of my babysitters when i was , like , 14 .
yeah , i' m afraid it doesn' t work like that in the " land of the free .
cheers .
what ?
thank god gabrielle found another trashy friend to hang out with .
yes .
your daughter .
bye , mom .
and thank you so much again , dad .
bye .
see ?
he loved the hair .
little change in plans , mr. president ?
oh , you two have been with me a long time .
we spend the day at the love parade and then we go to my friend' s club .
it' s the hottest place in the whole city .
that' s okay .
are you okay ?
yeah .
what a great idea , to change my hair .
it' s perfect .
yes , i told you .
no one knows who i am .
you get jet lag , morales ?
no .
really ?
l get it awful .
i take herbs .
herbs ?
yep .
really ?
why ?
they help reset your clock .
l' d like to reset your clock .
l' m just saying .
gabby , i am so excited .
l feel so free .
you' re going to love it .
sorry .
sorry .
excuse me .
anna , come on .
it' s okay .
there' s plenty more inside .
gabby , you are so right .

l can' t wait .
it' s gonna be crazy .

you are now rocking with the best , hard working , revolution sure shot .

no way !
he said just two of you .
no , that' s just security ...
don' t worry about it .
they' re local guys .
liberty' s heading out to the bathroom .

l can' t believe he did it again .
he completely broke his promise .
don' t i deserve one night of freedom ?
l' m not even talking freedom .
two agents .
oh , my god , anna .
l have a great plan .
don' t look back .
don' t look back .
l' m saying ...
anna ?
anna !
anna !
secure the perimeters .
liberty' s awol .
anna , run !
anna !
anna !
oh , god .

sir , excuse me .

could you please help me get out of here ?
yeah , why not ?
thank you .
stop !

go , go , go .

oh , my god .
l can' t believe i just did that .
l' m on fire !
l' m untouchable !
l' m anna .

ben calder .
freelance getaway man .
yeah , need the hand .
need the hand .
thank you , thank you , thank you so much , mr. ben .
you' re welcome .
l think .
depending on what crime i' ve just aided and abetted .
no .
no , no crime .
l don' t think .
thank you again , very much .
thanks .
anna ?
do you have a last name ?
no , actually , it' s just ...
it' s anna .
like pink .
thank you again .
actually , i need another ride , if that' s okay .
very fast .
like , right now .
whatever you say , mrs. bond .
they' re chasing us !
they' re chasing us !
go , go , go , go , go .
ben , i think we just lost them .
oh , we lost them , did we ?
so why the wild ride , anna ?
concert security .
l snuck in , they caught me .
chaos erupted .
yeah , because they always give giant chase vehicles to bouncers .
maybe there was a little bit more involved than just that .
almost always is , isn' t there ?
yeah .
well , i' m gonna go .
so ...
thank you so much for the ride , ben .
l appreciate it .
bye .
oh , wait .
helmet ?
so sorry .
thanks .
you' re sure you know where you' re going ?
yes .
no .
l' m supposed to be meeting a friend of mine at this bar , marquis de sade .
do you have any idea where that is ?
hang on .
mate , it' s me .
l' ve got a question for you .
marquis de sade bar , what' s the address ?
the corner of jakubska and templova .
okay , yeah .
see you later , mate .
bye .
ben , i know you probably think i' m this really rude ...
thank you .
hold on .
so you a big drinker ?
i drink .
you' re not drinking ?
you' re getting pissed for the both of us .
so where are you headed ?
l am kind of ... ... backpacking through europe on my way to berlin for the love parade .
oh , right .
where' s your backpack ?
backpacking is just an expression .
oh , yeah .
for what ?
fine .
okay , fine .
you caught me .
l' m on vacation here with my parents ... ... and it' s this numbing series of five star hotels and seven course brunches .
and i just can' t take it anymore .
it' s tough to take , i guess .
you know , chocolate mint on your silk pillow .
nightmare .
so ... ... what' s your story ?
l mean , like , why are you here all by your eyelashes ?
i mean , self .
well , actually , i' m here on holiday .
indulging in my passion for photography .
taking pictures of european architecture ... ... and drunk teenage fugitives , of course .
hey .
l' m not some drunk ...
holy shit .
l have to go .
oh , god , i have to go .
why don' t you duck into the loos and , kind of , kill two birds sort of thing .
you ...
you are great .
you .
you stay here , you .
okay ?
be back .
what took you so long ?
why' d you leave , agent calder ?
you should have stopped her at the concert .
and let the first daughter cause a scene with photographers hanging around ?
she' s yours .
she' s hiding in the loos and drunk , so i' m sure she' il go easy .
l' il check in with you later .
he' s tall .
what ?
he' s tall .
great .
she ran off with a stranger .
you said he was secret service .
it smells like wet cigars .
she does not know he' s secret service .
l think the maid was smoking .
she' s desperate for freedom , jim .
you pushed her into this with your lack of trust .
you' d tell me if you started smoking again , right ?
you want me to trust some person that would go off with a complete stranger ?
of course i' d tell you .
i thought you said he was secret service .
she does not know that .
the maid smokes cigars ?
wait .
she doesn' t know that .
how can a president with a 63 percent approval rating ... ... have absolutely no understanding of his teenage daughter ?
she needs at least the illusion of independence .
that' s exactly what i' m gonna give her .
phil !
harper !
yes , mr. president .
tell me about ben calder .
very capable .
youngest agent in europe .
father was american .
respected cla .
killed in the line of duty seven years ago .
ben was raised in england by a british mother .
harper , get ben calder on the phone .
sir .
phil , contact weiss and morales .
sir .
what are you doing ?
get calder .
she wants freedom ?
let freedom ring .
i don' t know if he can handle that .
what do you want now ?
ben calder .
whatever you say .
mr. president , hello .
i want you to keep our daughter .
sir ?
make sure she has no idea who you are .
but , jim ...
but , sir ...
weiss and morales are being informed of this plan as we speak .
james .
mr. president , with all due respect ...
all due respect would mean accepting this duty without protest , calder .
my apologies .
i know my daughter .
without mtv and clean sheets she' il beg to come home .
what if she doesn' t , sir ?
the point is to get a little rebellion out of her system ... ... without risk to her or revealing your identity .
ever .
and that' s paramount , calder .
ever .
it' s all you , baby .
i don' t think we should be doing this .
i want anna to be happy .
you think the only way is to give her freedom ... ... so that' s what i' m doing .
only , i' m gonna be the one controlling that freedom .
trust me .
it' s perfect diplomacy in action .
they just left ?
yeah , i guess you gave them the slip .
too smart for them , hey ?
so i' m free .
yes !
l finally will get to experience the real prague .
l wanna taste it .
l wanna smell it .
be sure to smell it before you taste it .
ben , i wanna find passion ...
awful .
sorry about that , we' re just ...
yeah .
looking for passion .
tell you what .
second thoughts .
why don' t we just forget the bike .
okay .
sorry .
it' s so beautiful .
okay , now you' ve seen it .
let' s go .
hold this .
what are you doing ?
l' m taking my clothes off .
can you please stop it ?
i told you , i wanna experience freedom ... ... at its utmost freest .
l wanna swim naked in the danube !
actually , it' s the vltava .
who wants to swim naked in the vltava ?
nobody says that .
in english , vltava means " unhealthy bacteria level .
yeah , right .
why can' t you be free ... ... without being naked ?
can you help me unhook this ?
oh , good lord .
never mind .
l got it .
l' m a dead man .
l am officially a dead man .
oh , perfect .
anna , get here right now .
this is inappropriate behavior in a public place .
l' m not coming in that water .
like to buy that camera , please .
why would i want to ... ?
okay .
thank you .
there .
pleasure doing business with you .
honey ?
you know , let' s get a quick shot .
just one for the kids .
quick one .
smile .
all right , what do you say ?
schnitzel .
l tell you what .
l bet a nice , warm bubble bath back at the hotel would be fabulous about now .
it would be my pleasure to escort you .
no .
l' ve smelled the city ... ... and now i wanna taste it .
god , i knew you were gonna say that .
you are no fun .
you know that ?
oh , i' m sorry .
l tend to lose my joi de vivre when i' m cold , wet ... ... and starting to chafe .
it' s your own fault .
who swims fully clothed in the danube ?
we' ve been over this .
where' s that music coming from ?
oh , my god .
it' s amazing .
l wanna see it from up there .
see , what you don' t understand is , like , this is historic for me .
no one ever lets me do anything remotely dangerous , and i' m never alone .
anyway , it' s not like this is that dangerous or anything .
well , not unless you grab the pipe .
oh , god .
all right , it' s probably best if you hold your horses and let me go first ... ... because this looks to me like it could be a little bit ... ... tricky .
we almost died .
that was incredible .
not too dramatic , are you ?
come and have a look at this .
this is incredible .
you see that woman ?
she thinks that she' s just having a dream .
but she' s not , and he' s deceiving her .
yeah ?
well , how else can paris get helen to show him how she truly feels ?
it' s the perfect deception .
so it' s all right to deceive with good reason ?
here' s my theory .
telling the truth isn' t always good , but lying isn' t always bad .
if telling the truth makes someone feel bad , lying can be good .
good things can come from lying , bad things from the truth ... ... although sometimes telling part of the truth is the same thing as telling a lie .
and that' s good or bad ?
i don' t know .
that part of the theory is kind of new for me .
anna .
beautiful .
isn' t this romantic ?
almost like we' re on a date , isn' t it , morales ?
yeah , right .
you on a last name basis with most of your girlfriends ?
cynthia .
please , don' t .
just don' t .
l know .
l know , it didn' t feel right .
sorry .
offenbach is okay , but i much prefer the italian operas .
you know , tragic and romantic .
l' m terribly sorry , milady .
all those rooftops were booked this evening , so deal with it .
rigoletto is my favorite .
l can totally relate to gilda , you know , cloistered and love starved in the nunnery .
come on .
trips to europe .
tickets to the opera .
your life can' t possibly be that bad .
l never said it was bad .
it' s just ... ... ionely .
and the funny thing is i am never , ever alone .
beer is good , isn' t it ?
l' ve always thought so .
oh , my god .
what time is it ?
l need to call my parents .
i thought you wanted to be liberated .
liberated , yes .
grounded , no .
can i use your cell phone , please ?
dead , i' m afraid .
drenched with your danube .
are these correct ?
approximations .
i want exact numbers .
how long ?
approximately ?
just get them .
yes , sir .
home base .
go .
hi .
it' s anna .
can i speak to my mom ?
honey , are you okay ?
yes , mom , i' m fine .
l' m totally fine , okay ?
don' t worry about me .
how' s dad ?
anna ?
dad ?
listen to me .
you were wrong .
you broke your promise .
l needed your trust .
when i saw you sent all those agents , i went crazy , which i know wasn' t right .
this is your fault , so i' il give you the chance to apologize .
you' re right , sweetie .
l shouldn' t be making promises i don' t intend to keep .
maybe i can learn to lighten up a bit .
sir .
dad , thank you very much for not being mad about this .
l was your age once too .
l' m just glad you' re safe .
l don' t know .
you know what ?
l' m gonna say it .
you guys have officially turned into cool parents .
maybe you' re starting to ...
anna catherine foster ... ... you get yourself back here right now .
your little adventure is over with .
what ?
see what your daughter' s been up to ?
l want her here now .
what about " let freedom ring " ?
where is she ?
train station .
listen to me .
you do not , you hear me , do not get on a train !
are you kidding ?
you traced my call ?
l' m your father .
and the president .
l' il trace whatever i wanna trace .
know what ?
l' il meet you on the plane on sunday .
trace this .
anna ?
get her brought in .
get calder on the phone .
ben .
it' s time for me to go now .
so where are they picking you up ?
they' re not .
l' m not going back .
l' m going to berlin for the love parade .
you' re not going back with your parents ?
no , they turned cool .
they told me to fly like the wind or something .
are you gonna come ?
l' m not gonna chase you through europe .
i can go by myself .
well , you can' t .
why not ?
because .
because why ?
because european railway travel can be very dangerous .
l mean , it' s the preferred method of travel for delinquents and lunatics ... ... perverts , thieves , the odd slasher now and again .
they' re not properly maintained .
the trains .
the slashers are world class .
yeah .
nice try , ben .
thanks .
anna , just stop and think , will you ?
i don' t wanna think .
l wanna live .
l am so tired of knowing where i' m gonna be every second of every day .
prisoners have more freedom than i do .
l just ...
i want real life , where real things happen .
real life is overrated .
it' s a lot of odd smells and disappointment .
besides , you don' t even have any money .
i have enough .
when i researched the love parade , i read about this girl from cleveland ... ... who made it on 2 bucks .
she sold her poetry along the way .
by the time she got there , she made $ 100, 000 .
bollocks .
i read it on the internet .
on the internet , elvis is the conductor on the orient express .
i have this theory .
great , another theory .
hit me .
if something' s meant to happen , it will .
that' s a short one .
no time .
thank you .
bye .
you' re killing me .
all right , we got them .
the tracks are this way .
hurry .
hurry .
which one is it ?
probably the green one .
thank you .
sir ?
excuse me .
can you tell me which train goes to berlin ?
that one .
thank you .
berlin , over there .
what ?
nothing .
why is it i find that highly unlikely ?
you have a little thing for me .
l' il stop you there .
l do not have a thing for you .
little or otherwise .
why did you get on the train with me to berlin , then ?
okay , you know what ?
you' re right .
l' m attracted to exhibitionist runaways .
it' s an addiction .
l was in a program where we had to spend time with fully clothed homebodies ... ... but i' ve relapsed again .
nobody forced you to come with me .
l don' t need a babysitter .
what ?
what is that smile for ?
you don' t think i can take care of myself ?
just because we spent the last 15 hours together and i' ve rescued you 15 times ... ... which , for the record , works out at once an hour ... ... how could i think you couldn' t take care of yourself ?
that' s ridiculous .
would you get over yourself ?
l don' t need you .
l' m sorry .
if that' s what you think of me , why don' t you just leave .
seriously .
go .
bye bye .
l don' t need you .
why aren' t you leaving ?
we' re on a moving train .
fine .
then don' t talk to me .
not on this train .
great .
this is a mickey mouse assignment .
l resent it .
do you ?
no .
i do .
i just do what i' m told .
oh , yeah ?
strip naked .
oh , gosh .
let me ask you something , weiss .
do you actually get women like this ?
oh , yeah , please .
baby , give it to me .
give me some of that hard hat , right here , right now .
there are actually women like that ?
a couple .
hello , sleepy .
toblerone ?
it' s got almonds .
oh , gosh .
no , thanks .
l' m not really a nut person .
don' t i know you ?
no , i don' t think so .
i guess not .
scotty mcgruff .
hi .
l' m anna .
oh , right .
that' s ben .
hello .
so are you two ... ?
no .
yeah , ben here accidentally got on this train when he meant to get on ... ... the knight in shining armor express .
so you' re not together ?
definitely not .
delight .
so , anna , ever made slow love on a high speed train ?
sorry , romeo .
sun' s in my eyes .
mellow yellow , mate .
l was just making conversation .
no one' s looking to snag your travel buddy .
in fact , i prefer to float along alone .
just me , my tunes and my knapsack .
and your sandals .
you sassing my air jesus ?
don' t listen to ben .
he' s full of himself .
something you need to talk about ?
oh , no .
ben' s issues are not my problem .
he doesn' t know me , because i' m not the selfish brat he thinks i am .
i never said you were selfish .
you know nothing about my life .
nothing .
no , i suppose i don' t .
whatever .
it doesn' t matter , because when this train stops we' il go our separate directions .
chilly willy , squabblers .
take a few of these on your solo travels , then .
what are these ?
six million dollar man stickers .
these stickers are my contribution to the global community .
everyone i meet gets a handful .
your job , post them up .
pound one on a door , slap one on a kiosk , place one on a postbox ... ... wherever your life may lead you .
and then what ?
then , nothing .
you forget about the sticker .
you move on .
one day , maybe you' re down in the dregs .
and all of a sudden , there it is .
in the corner of a window , the door of a subway , the side of a telephone booth .
one of the stickers .
it puts a smile on your face because you know ... ... you are not alone in the world .
we' re all connected .
wanker .
want some ?
hey , listen .
l' m sorry i treated you like a child .
l was just feeling a little bit overprotective .
thank you .
that' s very nice of you , but i already have a father .
yeah .
god , get off me .
rock on , mate .
oh , my new friends .
who knows when the fickle finger of fate will bring us together ?
l propose a moment of silent bonding before we reach venice .
before we get where ?
okay .
so we got on the wrong train .
so what ?
let' s just make the best of our misfortune .
our misfortune will last until tomorrow ... ... because the next train to berlin is in the morning .
so it' s just a bit of a diversion .
come on , enjoy .
take a picture .
this could be one of the most beautiful places i have ever seen .
be with you in two shakes .
l' m gonna make a call .
no worries .
l' il look after her .
sir , i got agent calder .
they' re putting him through .
for god' s sake .
anna ?
calder ?
calder ?
we lost him .
great .
the call came from venice .
weiss and morales are halfway to berlin .
we can get them to venice in a few hours .
we can have agents in the city in minutes .
l do not want to cause a scene .
just get them to venice and keep calling calder .
anna !

anna will want to see the sights .
whatever you say .

l' m not doing anything .
what' s the problem ?
no problem .
no problem .
here in the construction lunch break that is my very personality ... ... l' m adding on a sensitivity wing .
i didn' t really mean any of that .

sweetness .
ben .

precious , i just love it when you call me that .
your love , it' s beautiful .
no money , no ride .
sir , please .
we were married against my parents ' wishes .
we tried to stay apart , but it was no good .
exactly , because i would rather die ... ... than live another day without my lover man .
we have nothing but we have everything .
we' ve come so far on only the currency of young love .
if sweet stories could buy pasta , you' d be very fat by now .
thank you .
all right .
yes .
for you , the canals are free tonight .
my first cliente .
mama will be so proud !
on second thought ...
after you , darling .
let me remember .
where does this go ?

my first joke with my first customer .
we did good , huh ?
l was a little worried when you went to " the currency of young love .
but apart from that , you were fairly magnificent .
thank you .
pleasure .
you know , i just married you , but i know nothing about you .
there' s not much to know .
okay .
ben calder , 23 years old .
born in wales and then moved to london with my mother when she left my father .
my father ... ... was always at work .
never at home .
my mother wanted him to make the big gesture .
what' s the big gesture ?
you know , " i' il quit for you .
l' il stay home for you , darling .
but he didn' t .
because ...
well , people don' t really do that , do they ?
l don' t know what people do .
thank you , ben .
what for ?
l couldn' t have done any of this without you .
seems to me you' d have been just fine on your own .
amore , such a beautiful thing .

actually , we don' t have a hotel .
newlyweds .
first no money and now no place to ...
to stay .

make no mistake .
america is committed to backing leaders and nations ... ... that are paving the hard but rewarding path toward political and economic reform .
okay .
let' s just check with the local police .
to answer your question , no .
l don' t get women that way .
haven' t actually had a girlfriend since ...
let' s just say that women stopped beating down my door ... ... about the same time the bangs stopped covering the receding hair line .
stop overcompensating .
you' re a good iooking ...
you look fine .
some girls like a bald head .
l' m not bald yet .
l' m just saying .
you should embrace it .
maybe you could cut it really short .
some girls like that .
they think it' s sexy .
so ...
i' m gonna sleep on the floor ... ... which means that you can have the bed to yourself .
you don' t have to do that .
there' s plenty of room here for both ...
no , no .
it' s fine .
l prefer the floor ... ... because it' s just a bit ... ... iower .
which i like .
you know , so ...
yeah .
oh , come on .
don' t be shy .
it' s our wedding night .
ben ?

anna !
you don' t need to protect me .
i know what i' m doing .
no , you don' t ...
can you please stop taking your clothes off around me ?
what' s wrong with you ?
anna ... ... what happened on the gondola was me trying to hide you , nothing else .
that was a real kiss .
no , it wasn' t .
i don' t believe you .
it' s the truth .
l told you .
we' re just two people traveling in the same direction .
so you didn' t ... ... feel anything ?

l didn' t feel anything .
so can you please just get into bed ?
naked virgin safely in bed .

one of your stupidest .
he hung up before any of that .
you look at this view ?
is anna in it ?
no .
let' s keep moving .
l' m not leaving this spot till you take a moment to appreciate this .
you know , it' s not enough just to be a beauty , morales .
you have to be able to appreciate beauty too .
nice to have you back , weiss .
l' d like to take a moment to give thanks to anna ... ... who ran from her parents , jumped a train to venice instead of berlin ... ... thus giving us the opportunity to witness this phenomenal sight .
amen .
finished ?
oh , come on .
it' s hip hop hebrew .
you had a good night ?
yes , great .
thank you .
thank you so much for your hospitality .
but you were very quiet .
the walls is like paper , but i hear nothing .
that' s just because he' s repelled by me .
but it' s not true .
tell her she' s a beautiful woman .
you' re a beautiful woman .
and kiss her .
come on .
you want a happy marriage , you gotta kiss her every day .
it' s okay .
we' il work it out .
mama , where are the car keys ?

idiot !
thank you , darling .
eugenio , thank you so much for everything .
l wish i had something else to offer you .
six million dollar man .
it' s a wonderful gift .
a beautiful couple .
take care of each other .
hey .
don' t touch me .
english , por favor .
that' s spanish , weiss .
allora , about eugenio .
he was a good accountant .
why he buy the stupid boat ... ?
he was last seen with these two people .
the newlyweds .
l say we don' t tell him until we have something really good to go with it .
we find her and say , " here' s your daughter .
sorry , mr. president .
she' s married .
god , this is bad .
it was bad before , but now it' s beyond bad .
yep .
this is pretty much as bad as it gets .
now you touch me ?
they just crossed the austrian border .
weiss and morales are en route .
no contact with calder since yesterday .
enough .
l want a full contingent at that love parade .
jim , how could you let this happen ?
i don' t know .
it happened .
sir ?
there' s one more thing .
what else ?
we think they' re married .
so , what is it ?
do you have a girlfriend ?
l mean , is that who you called yesterday ?
no , no girlfriend .
okay , well , if you didn' t like girls , you could' ve just said something to me .
hey , listen , i like girls .
oh , okay .
so you' re just not attracted to this one .
no , that' s okay .
this whole time i felt alone because i never had any opportunities ... ... because i never had privacy , but thanks for proving me wrong .
l needed that .
anna , believe me , this is not about you .
romance is simply not ... ... a feasible option for me right now .
oh , god .
kill me now .
romance is not a feasible option " ?
you know what ?
the joke is on you , my friend .
l was just kidding last night .
l would never go through with it .
of course you wouldn' t .
no !
stop !
anna , don' t .
anna .
anna .
oh , come on .
bye bye .
unbelievable .
good luck .

hi , i just ...
guten tag .
that' s the extent of my german .
l really need the bike .

bungee !

jumpinggermans .

mcgruff ?

mcgruff .

my reasons were noble .
i trusted you .
l needed the scratch .
what can i say ?
please forgive .
three , two , one , bungee !
bungee !
need to put this tighter .
oh , no , wait , wait , wait !
are you crazy ?
what are you doing ?
get away from me .
l' m jumping , and you can' t stop me .
bloody hell .
if you' re scared , why do it ?
because the things you' re scared of are usually the most worthwhile .
just a theory .
you know what ?
actually , my dad taught me that .
hold tight .
god !
oh , my lord .
hi .
hello .
here we go .
l can' t believe we just did that .
check that out .
holy crap .
yeah , you' d better stay out there .
you know , we needed that money .
you guys got it all wrong .
l gave most of it back .
besides , that money was for love .
l' ve been traipsing over this stinking continent looking for a girl i' ve never met .
we made goo goo eyes from , like , 30 meters .
but our eyes locked .
we connected , which is next to impossible in this world .
you know that .
you can' t let a feeling like that pass you by .
you' d hug him all over again , wouldn' t you ?
l' m all right .
l' m all right .
just so you know , that' s incredibly hot .
oh , i' m sorry .
oh , hi , gus gus .
gus gus .
so much of you they had to name you twice .
l thought you might need this .
thanks .
so ...
yes ?
so ...
no .
for a girl who claims to be terminally alone , you sure do get a lot of offers .
and rejections .
you' re right .
you know what ?
l' m tired of living my life just in theory .
i think i' m gonna go talk to gus gus .
oh , come on .
you can' t seriously be attracted to that walking ... ... alp .
l don' t know .
l can see myself in the mountains , raising children ... ... little hans hans and gunther gunther .
anna , don' t .
why not ?
because i don' t trust him .
i don' t think he' s good enough for you .
yeah , right .
because up until the last three days i was perfectly content with my life ... ... of solitary adventure and then you came along ...
well , you came along and those two things seemed mutually exclusive .
ben .
can you ever just say what you really feel ?
okay , all right .
because ... ... l' m jealous as hell .
l' d hate to see you with gus gus .
l' d hate to see you with another man .
not only did i adore kissing you in venice ... ... but also because ... ... l' m so un bloody hinged just being near you .
l guess you fixed it , huh ?
anna .
calder .
where the hell have you been ?
listen , weiss .
she' s here and she' s safe .
we' ve been trying to reach you .
your orders changed .

okay .
l' ve gotta go , mate .
bring her in immediately .
we have a plan .
l promised i' d take her to the parade .
calder , listen to me .
listen .
i' ve got really bad reception here .
l gotta ...
who was that ?
just some friends from prague wondering where i am .
he' s gonna take her to the parade .
well , i guess we' re going to the parade .
what ?
what ?
you did this for me , right ?
this ?
no , i didn' t do it for you .
what ?

no , it was ...
i got tired of styling it , you know .

because it' s kind of sexy .
l' m sorry .

i know .
l' m sorry .
jesus , i' m sorry .
but something happened along the way .

together we' ve been able to move this humanitarian effort forward .
this has taken the cooperation of all our allies .
but we are still confident that these programs will benefit ...
how' s your heart ?
it' s ... ... a little bit broken .
oh , mom .
something about a college campus .
isn' t there , morales ?
you know ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , you know , the falling leaves ... ... the promise of youth , the smell of curricula .
l' m thinking we probably gotta get new partners .
l' m thinking i' m okay with that .

yeah .
as long as your partner' s an old fat guy .
i love old fat guys .
you do too .
you do .

what ?
you' re so silly .

you can' t learn about love in a classroom .
the dorms , maybe .

you can' t learn about it in a classroom .
love is not always that easy , anna .
nothing worth getting ever is .
