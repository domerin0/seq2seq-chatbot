here you go, my friend .
make sure you go as close as you can ,
i' il get you something extra if you make it a good trip .
i' m going to get you close , my friend .
but not too close .
you know what i mean ?
are you ready ?
ready !
ready !
1 , 2 , 3 !
are you scared ?
this is great !
you see anything yet ?
no ...
not yet .
what was that ?
i don' t know .
hold on .
what' s happening ?
hold on .
make it stop .
what happen to them ?
i don' t know .
we' re gonna crash .
no , we are not .
we' re gonna crash .
i' m going to take this tools .
let go the rope .
let go the rope !
move your hands .
come on .
keep ...
let go !
it' s gonna be okay .
actually charlie that doesn' t hurt .
they won' t really be fighting each other .
but these one here are corythosaurus .
they really like fighting with each other .
they use their teeth and their claws to rip each other' s jaws out .
alan , he' s three .
let' s wait until he is five .
right .
sorry , charlie .
ellie .
yes .
it' s tom again .
he says he has to talk to you about the last chapter .
just tell him i am not gonna to lose the jack corner club .
hey , look who' s here ?
this is alan .
nice to meet you , alan .
daddy .
this is hylaeosaurus .
that' s the dinosaur man .
dinosaur man ?
jack , say my name .
ls my name alan ?
ls my name alan ?
he used to know me .
here you go .
thanks .
so you know mark is going to work with the state department now .
what do you do , mark ?
it' s international relation most .
somethings like that .
i' il get her .
you guys ...
you guys have a little chat .
he' s a great guy .
so what are you working on now ?
raptors mostly .
my favourite .
do you remember the sounds they made ?
i try not .
ellie , all the theories are about raptors intelligence , what are they capable of ?
we work even close .
tell me .
we did plenty of scan on the raptors skeleton .
we find out it looks like a very sophisticated resonating chamber .
wait a second .
so we were right ?
i mean they had even living vocalise .
i' m convince they had the key of social intelligence .
which explains why they work together as a team .
and co ordinate they attacks .
and they probably know what is going on .
they could talk to each other .
to agree , we could never imagine .
ellie , they were smart .
they were smarter than dolphins or whales .
they were smarter than primates .
i just want to say i' il be ready to help with anything .
someday if you want to ask , you can call me .
anything .
anytime .
sure .
you' re still the best .
i mean it .
the last in my breed .
so the basic study about the interior chamber , and most of these specimens .
they begin to determine the exciting color relation between the upper pales and the leerings .
this lead us theorise the raptors .
which are capable of sophisticated vocalizations which were had been tremendous evolutionary advantange .
raptors were fierce , intelligent and socially sophisticated .
they were able to hunt in numbers and co ordinate their efforts .
with the catadysmic advance which overtook them it' s entirely possible that raptors or humans whether to become a dominant species on this planet .
i hope this has been interest .
it certainly excites us as it' s intelligence .
there is much more to discover .
that is why we continue to need and ask for your support .
thank you .
thank you very much , dr grant .
now , does anyone have a question ?
fine .
does anyone have a question that is not related to jurrasic park ?
all the incident in san diego which i did not witness .
yes , sir .
your theory on raptors is good .
but isn' t it a conjecture kind of mood ?
i mean once the un in costa rica and everyone decides how to handle that second island , scientists will just go in and look for themselves .
dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago .
what is left of them is fossilise in the rocks .
and this in the rock , that real scientists make real discovery .
now what john hammand and lngen in the jurassic park is created genetically engineered theme park monsters .
nothing more and nothing less .
are you saying that you don' t want to get to lsla sorna and study them if you have the chance ?
no force on earth or heaven .
forget beyond that island .
so what we got here ?
20 million gas operator sending out in a minute .
gunship , magazine , third routine and both our clothes cope with reducing muscles ...
here , udesky .
yes , sir .
we are going to get here .
the matter of fact is you knock things down as soon as you bought me that thing .
well , that' s right .
there are two of the best man that i would find .
no , sir .
i' ve not worked with them personally .
but believe me , sir .
these men come very highly recommended .
nothing to worry about , sir .
it' s going to be walk in park .
billy ,
i don' t think that i' m doing this right .
let' s try to do first .
you got to do this slowly .
it' il just take a little bit of time .
i can never tell what' s rock and what' s bone .
technically it' s all rock .
but calcium in the bones replace during fossilisation .
you can feel the difference , see .
rough ... smooth ...
rough ... smooth ...
dr grant !
mr brennan .
so how did it go ?
it' s not too late to change your major , billy !
worse , we gonna have backup in four weeks .
i have to run some equipment .
i got to show you something .
you like computers , right
i like the abacus , billy .
meet the future of paleontology .
it' s a rapid photo type .
i scanned them from the raptor skeleton .
lf the computer breaks down a thousand of slices .
and this thing scoops it .
one layer at a time .
it' s done .
i give you the resonating chamber of velociraptor .
listen to this .
this is brilliant , billy .
all i have to say , it' s just a little bit too late .
grant , paul kirby .
kirby enteprise .
my card .
how are you doing , billy . ?
what can i do for you , mr kirby ?
well , the first thing , i' m a great admirer of yours .
and i have a proposition and i would like to discuss with you .
would you have dinner with me and my wife this evening ?
it' il be our treat .
that will be great , but ...
i' m tired ,
i have been travelling .
maybe some other time .
believe me .
this will be worth you a while .
we love to .
terrific .
that' s the spirit .
good .
see you this evening then .
billy .
how are you ?
so what are you boys drinking ?
lce peak cap .
two please .
we admire your work for years .
really truly inspiring .
amanda and i just love the outdoors .
we have been on just every adventure that can come up with .
the neil and everything .
we even have two seats reserved on the first commercial flight to the moon .
and for the wedding anniversary this year , we like to do something really special ...
something ...
once in a lifetime .
i' ve charged an airplane to fly us lsla sorna .
and we like you to be our guide .
there you go , guys .
this is a very kind offer , mr kirby .
i' m a very very busy man .
i can recommend a couple of guys who is highly qualified that ...
no .
no .
you are the best .
you' d seen these animals in the flash .
there is even one comes close to you .
you won' t be able to fly enough low to see anything that is really interesting .
that' s the interesting part .
because we have the permission to fly low .
how low ?
haven' t issue yet .
but i can fly lower than anybody else .
i can tell you .
from what i understand , i understand ...
this is what we want .
you see , through my business dealing , import and export .
emerging market .
i have a lot of friends in high level .
ln that case , costa rica we can go in .
dr grant , you have no idea how this important to us that you come along .
this will be all the difference .
mrs kirby , i ...
and of course we love to make a contribution to your research here .
i can write all kind of numbers on this check , dr grant .
tell me .
what' s this gonna take ?
no way .
this one is lucky .
a couples years ago , some parties in lsland hand gladding these cleaves in museum .
and it' s big up draught come in and swipe me right across the sign .
wham !
well , it does sound like .
this strap saved my life .
i got hook on the rock when i was falling .
survivor are the most idiotic .
alan , thank you for bringing me along .
the bones will still be there when you get back .
this is the great thing about bones that they don' t run away .
the truth is , you got me into this .
i' ve no intention of being on my own with these people .
don' t get too excited , billy .
chances are once here think .
good time to be nice .
awake me when we get there .
so how do you know the kirbys ?
through our church .
ellie ...
ellie !
here we go , we' re almost there .
you' re approaching lsla sorna .
do you want to approach ...
my god .
i' ve forgotten .
we did it , honey .
we are here .
lf you see anything , yell up .
i thought of keep it to myself .
i' m sorry .
everyone , if you could look out the left of the plane .
you can see a whole curf of brachiosaurus .
ln fact you could see the front of the group alpha male grazing there .
udesky , nash .
how about the front ?
you guys see anything ?
nothing yet , mr kirby .
mrs kirby , look .
out here you' il see a group of triceratops ...
mr. kirby , we have to land in strip down ahead .
you want me to put it down ?
no .
no .
i told you on a circle to see the whole island .
you have been set down .
we can' t land here .
what are you talking about ?
hold on , i can explain .
you cannot land on this island .
it' s gonna be fine .
everybody sit down .
would you please sit down ...
tell me we didn' t land .
i think they are looking for someone .
dr grant , are you alright ?
i' m sorry we have to be so ...
who hit me ?
that will be cooper .
what are they doing ?
they are setting up a parameter .
then we could play safe .
these guys are good .
trust me . ln this island , there is no such thing as safe .
we must get back to that plane .
could you ask your wife stop making up that noise ?
that is a very , very bad idea .
amanda !
ben !
amanda , honey , dr grant says that is a bad idea .
what ?
he says it' s a bad idea !
what' s about idea ?
what was that ?
it' s a tyrannosaurus .
i don' t think so .
it sounds bigger .
we have to leave .
we have to leave now !
what' s going on ?
where is the professional who can handle this ?
it' s alright .
we' re just circled the island .
stop !
what is he doing ?
that' s cooper .
stop ...
no one can stop this plane .
are you okay ?
we' re okay up here .
everyone just stay put .
mayday !
mayday !
who has a satellite phone ?
i do .
i got it right here .
come and get it .
the radio is gone .
we haven' t landed yet .
damn it .
the number you call is busy " .
what was that ?
what is it ?
what ?
what ...
hold it !
hang on , everyone .
help me !
mrs kirby , come back !
amanda !
follow me !
ln here !
i think we lost him .
it' s okay .
it' s dead .
nobody move a muscle .
no ...
no ...
no ...
please don' t .
stop .
please .
it' s time you do some explain , mr kirby .
we called everyone .
we did verything we could .
no one would help us .
the costa rica goverment said this is no fly zone .
the us embassy ...
that' s our us embassy told we should accept the fact .
can you believe that ?
you left a 12 year old go para sailing alone ?
no !
he wasn' t alone .
he was with a friend .
ben hilderban .
paul and i divorced over a year ago .
so why me ?
he said we needed someone who had been on island before ?
yes .
but i did not tell you to kidnap somebody .
i have never been on this island .
sure you have .
you wrote that book .
that is lsla nublar .
this is lsla sorna .
you mean there are two islands with dinosaurs ?
you stay out of this .
so how long have he been missing ?
8 weeks .
almost 8 weeks .
billy , now go back to plane and set a camp .
and we make for the coast .
dr grant , we are not leaving this island without our son .
you can go on and look for him .
or you can stick with us as long as you don' t hold us up .
either way , you probably won' t get out of this island alive .
so ?
what do we do ?
go and search for your son .
that' s the direction they are going .
that' s the one .
excellent .
oh , sorry .
sorry .
it' s nothing you haven' t seen before .
how much weight did you lose ?
about 25 pounds !
i' ve been swimming .
i hate to swim .
and i don' t even know how to swim .
i learned .
you look good .
so are you .
how would you classify , billy ?
it' s a super predator .
suchominus .
i think bigger .
baryonyx ?
not on that cell .
spinosaurus stick up with this .
i don' t remember that on lngen' s list .
because it wasn' t on there , unless it makes them wonder what they are up to .
so , mr kirby , tell me .
when you climbed k2 , did you based camp at 25, 000 or 30, 000 feet ?
30, 000 feet .
we were pretty close to the top .
it is above 30, 000 feet , actually .
no .
no .
that' s a common mistake .
mr kirby , there is no such thing as kirby enterprise , isn' t ?
there' s kirby painting tile and plus .
the plus stands for bathroom fixtures .
we' re in the west case shopping centre ...
i suppose we don' t check you out or anything ...
now , listen to me .
i' il pay you the money ...
this is good .
no matter what .
we are in worst place on the world , we are not being pay .
alright , now wait .
fellows , hold on .
i' il make this up to you .
lf you ever do a bathroom or a kitchen ...
you are not really a mercenary , are you ?
i never said i was .
that' s true .
what are you ?
i' m like a booking agent .
guys who got sick count on me .
here .
see we are now in a hardware store .
pay in title , yeah .
you never can tell about people , do you ?
you get the truth .
eric !
quiet .
would you stop that ?
dr grant said this is a very dangerous territory .
look .
maybe we should split up or something , you know ?
we could cover twice as much of the island .
dr grant says that is a bad idea .
dr grant ...
dr grant says this ...
what' s the good of hiring an expert if we are not going to use his advice .
yeah .
except dr grant isn' t looking for eric .
he is looking for the coast .
okay , fine .
go ahead and scream .
and when cry sake plot comes and attacks .
don' t come crying to me .
not that bad .
what ?
nothing .
what did you say ?
nevermind .
what did you say ?
lf we split up , i' m going along with you guys .
eric !
eric !
mrs kirby .
eric !
mrs kirby !
mrs kirby , the chance is our remote .
there are still in our resonance .
an adult .
hey , guys .
that' s my camera .
the battery is dead .
i got an idea .
let me have the camera .
i shot this in the morning he disappeared .
he is alive .
i know he' s alive .
we got to find him .
will we find one of those ?
maybe .
only if cell is not doing .
let' s take it .
lf we spot a plane , it might be the good way to get attention .
i got it .
okay .
okay !
mrs kirby , please !
okay , you are free .
come back , mrs kirby .
amanda , wait .
amanda .
amanda ?
amanda ...
amanda !
amanda , stop ...
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry about ben .
it' s not ben, paul .
it' s eric .
he' s out there all by himself .
i know , i know .
our kid is out there all by himself .
listen to me .
we' il find him .
i promise .
paul ..
dr grant !
you should come and look at this !
raptor .
we are going to find him .
are you listening to me ?
we are going to find him .
this kid got resources .
remember last time we tried to ground him ?
where' s billy ?
what are you doing ?
i was trying to go to the nest .
don' t do that again .
i' m sorry .
lf i lose you , that means you are a damn tourist .
i bet they are in there , don' t you think ?
i bet my bottom dollar .
what you think it is ?
that' s ancient .
four seasons .
eric !
paul, don' t do that ...
what the hell ?
who' s got some change ?
let me take some quarters .
i got a buck ten ...
this is how you make dinosaurs .
no .
this is how you play god .
that way !
look out .
it' s locked .
this way !
go !
go !
hey !
over here !
push !
push !
my god .
it' s calling the other half .
come on !
it' s in a hurry .
out from the trace .
udesky .
mr kirby !
billy !
ls alan with you ?
oh my god ...
mr udesky !
mr udesky !
he' s dead .
oh my god .
no, he' s not .
no , he' s not !
no ...
wait !
something is not right .
amanda !
hold on !
hold on !
they set a trap .
yeah , they set a trap .
what do you say ?
what do you looking for ?
thanks .
thanks a lot , eric .
you know who i am ?
yeah , your parents are here .
they are looking for you .
together ?
together .
that' s not good .
they don' t take so well to get together .
i think it' s big surprise when people could do in it .
when i have to .
you are alan grant .
what are you doing here ?
your parents ... invited me along .
i read all of your books .
i like the portion more .
before you are on the island .
you like dinosaurs back then .
well back then they hadn' t try to eat me then .
when i jumped in here , they left a lot of stuff behind .
any weapons ?
no . l just use the gas ...
and i appreciate that .
be careful with that t rexas .
scare some of the small ones away , but attacks the really big one with defend .
this is t rexas ?
how do you get it ?
you don' t want to know .
dessert ?
sure .
eric ,
i have to tell you lost for eight weeks in this island .
ls that all has been ?
you are alive .
that' s the important thing .
and thanks to you is one thing we have in common .
did you read malcom' s book ?
yeah .
so ?
i don' t know .
i mean ...
it was kind of preaching ...
and too much chaos .
everthing is chaos .
it seem like the guy was hiding himself .
well that' s two things we have in common .
what is it ?
coelophysis .
alan !
alan !
alan !
no matter how this turns out it wasn' t your fault .
eric is always a sorry little kid .
always .
and he threw someone like ben hilderban into the mess ...
well ...
well what ?
all i' m saying it' s not your fault .
no ... lf he' d been with you , he' il be completely safe .
you drive 5 miles in every speed limit , paul .
and i' d thrown three cars in three years .
well , not three .
the buek wasn' t really total .
i just said i was , cause i wanted get a " yes , you do " .
i' m so sorry that you have to be here .
i' m not .
there' s a boat lie along side the bank .
looks in good shape .
rescue boat ?
no .
someone left behind .
let' s move .
stick to the plan .
head for the coast .
you are not going to look for dr grant .
heading the coast is alan' s idea .
lf he' s alive , there is where he' s heading .
i agree .
what about eric ?
eric is a smart kid .
he probably know he stands a best chance by the coast .
he figures all the big dinosaurus are in the centre of the island .
right ?
sure .
you know what this is ?
that' s a raptor claw .
i have one .
a fossil .
mine is new .
how much do you explore ?
i stick pretty close to the compound .
i think if anyone is looking for me ...
there' s where they started .
we need to get to the coast .
that was a plan .
are you sure ?
the closer you get to the water , the bigger the things get .
we have to find a way to the canyon to find a river out to the coast .
after we find your parents .
and then what ?
one step to the time .
listen .
what ?
that' s my dad satellite phone .
how do you know ?
kirby painting tile and plus .
dad !
eric !
eric !
eric !
this way !
eric !
mom !
dad !
eric !
mom !
dad !
i know it .
oh my god .
i know it .
oh my god .
oh , i' m glad to see you .
hey , you got my beg .
yeah , lucky strap .
want me to carry it ?
need to find a gap here .
how did you know we were here ?
the phone .
the stupid jingle from the store .
i heard it .
my phone ?
yeah , your satellite phone .
where is it ?
i don' t have it .
when did you use it last night ?
on the plane .
i got a call on the place and ...
what ?
i loaned it to nash .
he must have had it when he ...
run .
alan , you wanna give me the bag back .
it' s okay , billy .
i got it .
please give me the bag .
it' s not safe .
raptor' s eggs ?
did you steal raptor' s eggs ?
now it all make sense .
i swear if i know you' re gonna end up with them .
i took them on an impose .
i thought that the door with the fortune are enough for the things i obtain 10 more years .
but you have to believe me this was a stupid decision .
but i did it with the best intentions .
with the best intentions ...
some other worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions .
come on , billy .
as far as i concern , you are not better than the people who built this place .
what are you doing ?
those things are after us because of those .
those things know we have the eggs .
i drop them into the river .
they will still be after us .
what if they catch us with them ?
what if they catch us without them ?
there is a boat at the bottom , just down the river .
we try to make to the coast , at least .
you' re okay ?
yeah .
let' s do this one other time , shall we ?
okay , come on over .
one other time .
okay , eric . l' m gonna leave you just for a minute .
and then you are going to be right behind me , okay ?
mom , i' ve been alone in the water truck for eight weeks .
i think i can manage the next few minutes without you .
right .
we are all together now .
okay , eric .
come on , honey you go .
mom ?
oh my god .
what is it ?
it' s a bird cage .
for what ?
eric !
eric !
eric !
i can' t stay without my kid .
eric !
this way !
billy !
billy , stop .
billy , stop !
stop , billy !
billy !
eric , hold on !
eric !
jump !
billy !
look out now !
eric !
eric !
there he is !
with the pteranodous .
get him out of there .
go !
go !
what about billy ?
hang on , billy !
go away !
go away !
come on !
it' s playing the gasoline .
now just got to get out to the coast .
we got some sort of ... some sort of signal .
build the fire or something .
something that can see from the air .
dr grant ?
hey , eric .
how are you doing ?
i' m sorry about billy .
you know what' s the last thing i said to him was ?
it' s ... he' s as bad as the people who built this place .
it wasn' t true .
billy is just young ... that' s all .
i have a theory there is two kind of boys .
those who want to be astronomers .
and those who want to be astronauts .
the astronomers , the paying intelligence .
get to study this amazing things from a place with complete safety .
but he never got to go into space .
exactly .
lts the difference between imagining and seeing .
be able to touch them .
and ... that' s all billy wanted .
dr grant ...
it is open , dr grant .
billy was right .
listen .
find the phone before it stops ringing .
eric, stand there .
it' s here wait , it' s here .
i got it .
hello ?
hello ?
enjoy your meal in one of our four star restaurant ...
look out !
turn off the power .
you got to choose for making one call .
what do you do ?
don' t call the us embassy .
they won' t do a damn thing .
hey , guys .
come here .
look at this !
what is this ?
something must have spook them .
get the edge of calling , mr kirby .
open the plot .
hello ?
ellie !
hello ?
charlie !
charlie !
charlie , take the phone to mommy now .
it' s the dinosaur man .
okay .
charlie , are you taking the phone to mom ?
charlie ?
who' s in the phone ?
the dinosaur man .
he is ?
alan ?
where' s the phone ?
there .
get the phone .
ellie , listen to me !
alan , are you on a cell phone ?
i can' t hear you .
the raptor chases me ...
hello ?
dad !
dad !
dad !
paul , you can' t ...
you can' t leave me like this .
i' m not going anywhere .
dad !
remember when we went fishing a couple summers ago ?
we putted the boat in the water and the trailer sank .
the toll truck tried to pull us out and they got drag in too .
the truck driver wanted to knock my lights out .
i miss fishing .
mr kirby .
that lady you called .
who is she ?
how do you know that she can help us ?
she is the person i can always count on .
i owe her a lot .
i don' t think i have ever told her that .
you should .
you hear that ?
the ocean .
pick up your eggs .
everybody get down .
