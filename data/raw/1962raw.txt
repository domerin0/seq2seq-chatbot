# i feel i' m bein ' followed
# my head is empty
# every word i say turns out a sentence
# statements to a stranger
# just asking for directions
# goin ' from being helped
# to being questioned ...
0i , steph ?
are you all right ?
# i see a man without a problem #
it seems strange to see this procession of miserable specimens .
so different from the strutting hooligans of yesterday , who came here to pollute the air of this town .
yes .
these long haired , mentally unstable , petty little hoodlums .
these sordid caesars , who can only find courage , like rats , by hunting in packs , came to brighton with the avowed intent of intefrering with the life and property of its inhabitants .
and so far as the law gives us power , this court will not faii to use the prescribed penalties .
it may , perhaps , discourage you , and others of your kidney , who' re infected with this vicious virus , that you be ordered to pay a fine of 75 .
i' il pay now if you don' t mind .
haven' t got a pen , have you , your honour ?
that' s enough , silence !
take him away !
james michael cooper .
you stay right where you are !
i don' t have to ask where you' ve been , do i ?
i suppose you think this is clever ?
proud of yourself ?
no .
no ?
you was there , weren' t you ?
yeah , we were there .
and you had more of this filth with you , didn' t you ?
you can look shame faced , my lad .
i' ve a good mind to get the law .
where' d you get these ?
dunno .
someone gave ' em to me .
0h , did he ?
and you had to take ' em ?
no .
you' ve gotta look big .
if they was rat poison you' d have taken them anyway ?
then gone off like savages ruining everybody' s peace !
i look at you and don' t know what i' ve brought up !
your sister' s not like this !
ain' t she ?
what do you fucking know , eh ?
drugs and filthy pictures !
running riot over everywhere !
you' re a little animal , you wanna be locked up !
look what i' ve got !
a bloody mad thing !
all right .
you' re a little savage !
get out of my house , go on !
get out !
you' re no son of mine !
wait till your father comes home !
i' il wait !
go on , get out !
yeah , fuck off !
... fuckin ' house anyway , eh ?
# get out and don' t come back no more
# get out and don' t come back no more
# get out , don' t come back
# get out , don' t come back
# get out
# and don' t come back
# no more #
come .
the post room boy .
be with you in a minute , cooper .
absent for a full day last week , cooper .
now , i understand one day' s bank holiday' s not enough for you , so you have to take two .
may i enquire if there' s any reason for this ?
not really .
not ill or anything , were you ?
no .
mr cale tells me you spent the weekend in brighton .
i imagine you were involved in the ... disturbances there ?
yeah , i was there .
you weren' t arrested or detained or anything , were you ?
no .
i must say , i find your attitude fairly incomprehensible .
i feel i must warn you , cooper , that we cannot tolerate this kind of absenteeism amongst our junior staff .
you' ve got a good steady job , cooper .
plenty of young men' d give their eye teeth to be in your shoes .
yeah ?
find one , then .
i beg your pardon ?
you heard .
find one , then .
i' il tell you what to do with your job .
you can take that mail , and that franking machine , and all that other rubbish i have to go about with , and you can stuff ' em right up your arse !
hey , jimmy .
you lose a shilling and find sixpence , eh ?
well , look who it isn' t .
jimmy , i thought they' d locked you up .
yeah , i got fined , didn' t i ? 50 .
jesus .
another good customer bites the dust .
we couldn' t wait for you , had to get back to our jobs .
yeah , well i ain' t bothered .
i was with ace and that .
yeah , we went to court together
yeah .
yeah .
christ , he' s really weird tonight .
i couldn' t give a shit .
ferdy ?

yeah , how many you want ?
dunno .
how many you got ?

french blues .
i' il have the lot .
what ?
you can' t afford it !
where' d you get all that , then ?
golden hand shake , innit ?
two weeks money .
told him to stuff the job right up his arse .
you sure you want the whole bag ?
yeah .
why not , eh ?
why not ?
all right .
a fiver .
fiver .
what you gonna do with that lot ?
start a one man riot ?
yeah .
i might .
why' d you chuck your job ?

look , don' t give it all that , right ?
i just got fed up .

i found her by the road in brighton .
see you found yourself a new little boy , then ?
hey , jimmy ?
hope you find a new job .
0h , yeah ?
i could get you a job on the rubbish carts ?
you' re good at going up and down in alleys .
if i see you round ' ere again i' il fuckin ' kill you !
get off me !
what' s the matter ?
you' re not a face !
piss off !

forget her , jimmy !
shut up and piss off .

what' s the matter with you ?
you' re worse than he is !

well , i dunno .
it' s just ... it seems like everything' s going backwards .
steph ?
you sure it' s not you going backwards ?
no , it' s just ...
i can' t think straight , that' s all .
i mean , nothing seems right , apart from brighton .
brighton was 0k , going to court with the ace and that .
i was a mod there , you know ?
i mean , that' s something , innit , eh ?
what are you talkin ' about ?
brighton was a laugh , that' s why we went down there .

0h , what do you think ?
all right , so i fancied you .
we had it off .
but that don' t mean nothin ' .
