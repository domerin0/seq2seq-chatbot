oh , god , please .
i don' t wanna die .
you read the bible , brett ?
yes !
well , there' s this passage i got memorized .
sorta fits the occasion .
ezekiel 25 : 17 .
the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides ... by the inequities of the selfish ...
and the tyranny of evil men .
blessed is he who , in the name of charity and good will , shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness , for he is truly his brother' s keeper ... and the finder of lost children .
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance ... and furious anger ... those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers .
and you will know my name is the lord ... when i lay my vengeance upon thee .
i' m fucked .
oh , fuck .
oh , fuck .
oh , goddamn .
goddamn .
hmm ?
oh .
vincent , marvin .
marvin , vincent .
better tell him to shut up .
he' s gettin ' on my nerves .
fuck .
marvin .
marvin !
i' d knock that shit off if i was you .
die , you motherfuckers !
die !
why the fuck didn' t you tell us somebody was in the bathroom ?
slip your mind ?
did you forget that someone was in there ... with a goddamn hand cannon ?
you see the size of that gun he fired at us ?
it was bigger than him .
we should be fuckin ' dead , man .
i know .
we was lucky .
no , no , no , no .
that shit wasn' t luck .
yeah , maybe .
this was divine intervention .
you know what divine intervention is ?
i think so .
that means that god came down from heaven and stopped the bullets .
that' s right .
that' s exactly what it means .
god came down from heaven and stopped these motherfuckin ' bullets .
i think it' s time for us to leave , jules .
don' t do that .
don' t fuckin ' blow this shit off !
what just happened here was a fuckin ' miracle !
chill .
this shit happens .
wrong !
wrong .
this shit doesn' t " just happen .
do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car ... or in a jailhouse with the cops ?
we should be fuckin ' dead , my friend !
what happened here was a miracle , and i want you to fucking acknowledge it !
all right , it was a miracle .
can we go now ?
let' s go , nigger !
come on !
shit .
you ever seen that show cops ?
i was watching it one time , and there was this cop on , and he was talkin ' about this gunfight he had in the hallway with this guy , right ?
he just unloaded on this guy and nothin ' happened .
he didn' t hit nothin ' .
okay ?
it was just him and this guy .
i mean , you know , it' s , it' s freaky , but it happens .
you wanna play blind man , go walk with the shepherd , but me , my eyes are wide fuckin ' open .
what the fuck does that mean ?
it means that' s it for me .
from here on in , you can consider my ass retired .
jesus christ .
goddamn it .
don' t blaspheme .
i said , don' t do that !
hey , why are you fuckin ' freakin ' out on us ?
look , i' m tellin ' marsellus today i' m through .
why don' t you tell him at the same time why ?
don' t worry , i will .
and i bet you $10, 000 he laughs his ass off .
i don' t give a damn if he does .
marvin , what do you make of all this ?
man , i don' t even have an opinion .
you gotta have an opinion .
you think god came down from heaven and stopped
what the fuck' s happenin ' ?
aw , shit , man !
aw , man !
oh , man , i shot marvin in the face .
why the fuck' d you do that ?
i didn' t mean it .
it was an accident .
man , i seen some crazy ass shit in my time , but this  chill out , man !
it was an accident .
we probably went over a bump or somethin ' .
the car ain' t hit no motherfuckin ' bump .
i didn' t mean to shoot the son of a bitch .
the gun went off .
look at this fuckin ' mess !
we' re on a city street in broad daylight here !
i don' t believe it !
well , believe it now , motherfucker !
we gotta get this car off the road .
cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood .
just take it to a friendly place , that' s all !
this is the valley , vincent .
marsellus ain' t got no friendly places in the valley .
well , jules , this ain' t my fuckin ' town , man !
shit !
what you doing ?
i' m calling my partner in toluca lake .
where' s toluca lake ?
over the hill here , by burbank studios .
if jimmie' s ass ain' t home , i don' t know what the fuck we gonna do ,
' cause i ain' t got no other partners in 818 .
jimmie , how you doin ' , man ?
it' s jules .
just listen up , man .
me and my homeboy are in a car , and we gotta get it off the road , pronto .
i need to use your garage for a couple hours .
we gotta be real fuckin ' delicate with this jimmie situation .
he' s one remark away from kickin ' our asses out the door .
if he does , what do we do ?
we ain' t leavin ' ' til we make a couple calls , but i don' t want it to reach that pitch jimmie' s a friend .
you don' t come into your friend' s house and start tellin ' him what' s what .
just tell him not to be abusive .
he kinda freaked out back there when he saw marvin .
put yourself in his position it' s 8 : 00 in the morning , he just woke up .
he wasn' t expectin ' this shit .
we gotta remember here who' s doin ' who a favor .
if that favor means i gotta take shit , he can stick that favor straight up his ass .
fuck , nigger , what the fuck' d you just do to his towel , man ?
i was dryin ' my hands !
you' re supposed to wash ' em first !
you watched me wash ' em .
i watched you get ' em wet .
i was washin ' ' em .
this shit' s hard to get off .
maybe if he' d had lava i coulda done a better job .
i used the same fuckin ' soap you did , and when i finished , the towel didn' t look like no goddamn maxi pad !
what if he was to come in here and see his towel like this ?
it' s shit like this that' s gonna bring this situation to a head , man !
look , i ain' t threatenin ' you or nothin ' , all right ?
you know i respect you and all .
but just don' t put me in this position , all right ?
all right .
fine .
fine .
ask me nice like that , no problem .
just go handle your friend .
go ahead .
i don' t care .
mmm !
goddamn , jimmie !
this some serious gourmet shit .
me and vincent would' ve been satisfied ... with some freeze dried taster' s choice .
right ?
and he springs this serious gourmet shit on us .
what flavor is this ?
knock it off , julie .
what ?
i don' t need you to tell me how fuckin ' good my coffee is .
i' m the one who buys it .
i know how good it is .
when bonnie goes shopping , she buys shit .
i buy the gourmet expensive stuff ' cause when i drink it , i wanna taste it .
but you know what' s on my mind right now ?
it ain' t the coffee in my kitchen .
it' s the dead nigger in my garage .
jimmie , don' t even worry  don' t tell me about anything .
i wanna ask you a question .
when you came pulling in here , did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said , " dead nigger storage " ?
you know i ain' t seen no  did you notice the sign on the front of my house ... that said , " dead nigger storage " ?
no .
i didn' t .
you know why you didn' t see that sign ?
why ?
' cause it ain' t there , ' cause storing dead niggers ain' t my fuckin ' business , that' s why !
we' re not gonna store the motherfucker  don' t you fuckin ' realize ... that if bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house , i' m gonna get divorced ?
no marriage counselor .
no trial separation .
i' m gonna get fuckin ' divorced .
okay ?
and i don' t wanna get fuckin ' divorced !
man , you know , fuck , i wanna help you , but i don' t wanna lose my wife doin ' it .
jimmie , jimmie , she ain' t gonna leave you .
don' t fuckin ' " jimmie " me , jules !
okay ?
don' t fuckin ' " jimmie " me .
there' s nothin ' you' re gonna say that' s gonna make me forget i love my wife .
is there ?
now , look , you know , she comes home from work in about an hour and a half .
the graveyard shift at the hospital .
you gotta make some phone calls ?
you gotta call some people ?
well , then , do it , and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here .
that' s kool and the gang .
we don' t wanna fuck your shit up .
all i wanna do is call my people and get ' em to bring us in .
you' re fucking my shit up right now !
you' re gonna fuck my shit up big time if bonnie comes home .
do me that favor , all right ?
the phone is in my bedroom .
i suggest you get going .
well , say she comes home .
what do you think she' il do ?
oh , no fuckin ' shit she' il freak .
that ain' t no kinda answer .
i mean , you know , i don' t .
how much ?
a lot or a little ?
you got to appreciate what an explosive element ... this bonnie situation is .
she comes home from a hard day' s work , finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen ... doing a bunch of gangster shit , there ain' t no tellin ' what she' s liable to do .
yeah , i grasp that , jules .
all i' m doing is contemplating the ifs .
i don' t wanna hear about no motherfuckin ' ifs !
all i want to hear from your ass is , " you ain' t got no problem , jules .
i' m on the motherfucker .
chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry , which should be coming directly .
you ain' t got no problem , jules .
i' m on the motherfucker .
chill them niggers out and wait for the wolf , who should be coming directly .
you sendin ' the wolf ?
oh , you feel better , motherfucker ?
shit , yeah , negro !
that' s all you had to say !
she the hysterical type ?
when is she due ?
mm hmm .
give me the principals ' names again .
place your bets .
jules .
mm hmm .
cards , please .
vincent .
jimmie .
bonnie .
mm hmm .
it' s thirty minutes away .
i' il be there in ten .
you' re ...
jimmie , right ?
this is your house ?
it sure is .
i' m winston wolf .
i solve problems .
good .
we got one .
so i heard .
may i come in ?
uh , yeah .
please do .
you must be jules .
which would make you ...
vincent .
let' s get down to brass tacks , gentlemen .
if i was informed correctly , the clock is ticking .
is that right , jimmie ?
uh , one hundred percent .
your wife bonnie comes home at 9 : 30 in the a . m . , correct ?
uh huh .
i was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here , she wouldn' t appreciate it much .
she wouldn' t at that .
that gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta dodge , which , if you do what i say , when i say it , should be plenty .
now , you got a corpse in a car , minus a head , in a garage .
take me to it .
jimmie .
uh huh .
do me a favor , will ya ?
thought i smelled some coffee back there .
would you make me a cup ?
uh , yeah , sure .
oh , uh , um , how do you take it ?
lotsa cream , lotsa sugar .
about the car , is there anything i need to know ?
does it stall ?
does it smoke ?
does it make a lot of noise ? ls there gas in it ?
aside from how it looks , the car' s cool .
positive ?
don' t get me on the road and i find out the brake lights don' t work .
as far as i know , the motherfucker' s tip top .
good enough .
let' s go back to the kitchen .
here you go , mr. wolf .
thank you , jimmie .
mmm .
okay , first thing .
you two .
take the body , stick it in the trunk .
this looks to be a pretty domesticated house .
that would lead me to believe you got cleansers and shit .
yeah .
under the sink .
good .
what i need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products ... and clean the inside of the car i' m talkin ' fast , fast , fast .
go in the back seat , scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull .
get it out of there .
wipe down the upholstery .
it don' t need to be spick and span .
you don' t need to eat off it .
just give it a good once over .
what you need to take care of are the really messy parts .
the pools of blood that have collected , you gotta soak that shit up .
we need to raid your linen closet .
i need blankets , i need comforters , quilts , bedspreads .
the thicker the better , the darker the better .
no whites .
can' t use ' em .
we' il need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards ... with quilts and blankets , so if a cop starts stickin ' his big snout in the car , the subterfuge won' t last , but at a glance the car will appear to be normal .
jimmie , lead the way .
boys , get to work .
please " would be nice .
come again ?
i said , a " please " would be nice .
get it straight , buster .
i' m not here to say please .
i' m here to tell you what to do .
and if self preservation is an instinct you possess , you' d better fuckin ' do it and do it quick .
i' m here to help .
if my help' s not appreciated , lotsa luck , gentlemen .
no , mr. wolf , it ain' t like that ; your help is definitely appreciated .
mr. wolf , listen .
i don' t mean disrespect , okay ?
i respect you .
i just don' t like people barkin ' orders at me .
if i' m curt with you , it' s because time is a factor .
i think fast , i talk fast , and i need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this .
so pretty please , with sugar on top , clean the fuckin ' car .
don' t be lookin ' at me like that , all right ?
i can feel your look .
it' s a 1974 chevy nova .
green .
nothin ' except for the mess inside .
mmm , about 20 minutes .
nobody who' il be missed .
you' re a good man , joe .
thanks a bunch .
how we comin ' , jimmie ?
pretty good .
i got it all here , but , uh , [ sighs ]
mr. wolf , you gotta understand something .
winston , jimmie , winston .
okay .
you gotta understand something , uh , winston .
uh uh , no , thank you .
uh , this is our best linen here , and it' s , uh it was a wedding present ... from my uncle conrad and my aunt ginny .
they' re not with us anymore .
i wanna help  let me ask you a question .
if you don' t mind .
no , no , please .
go ahead .
your uncle conrad and aunt ginny , were they millionaires ?
no .
well , your uncle marsellus is .
and i' m positive that if uncle conrad and aunt ...
ginny .
ginny were here , they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set , which your uncle marsellus is more than happy to do .
i like oak myself .
that' s what i have in my bedroom .
how about you , jimmie ?
you an oak man ?
oak' s nice .
oh , man , i will never forgive your ass for this shit .
this is some fucked up , repugnant shit .
jules , did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he is wrong ... that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings ?
get the fuck out my face with that shit !
the motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up itty bitty pieces of skull ...
on account of your dumb ass .
i got a threshold , jules , for the abuse that i will take .
right now , i' m a fuckin ' race car , and you got me in the red .
i' m just sayin ' it' s fuckin ' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin ' red .
that' s all .
i could blow .
oh , you ready to blow ?
yeah .
well , i' m a mushroom cloud layin ' motherfucker , motherfucker .
every time my fingers touch brain , i' m superfly t. n. t.
i' m the guns of the navarone .
in fact , what the fuck am i doin ' in the back ?
you' re the motherfucker should be on brain detail !
we' re fuckin ' switchin ' .
i' m washin ' windows , and you' re pickin ' up this nigger' s skull !
fine job , gentlemen .
you may get out of this yet .
i can' t believe this is the same car .
well , let' s not start suckin ' each other' s dicks quite yet .
clean you two .
strip .
all the way ?
to your bare ass .
quickly , gentlemen .
we got about 15 minutes ... before jimmie' s better half comes pulling into the driveway .
goddamn , this morning air is some chilly shit .
are you sure this is absolutely necessary ?
you know what you two look like ?
what ?
like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody' s head .
strippin ' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary .
toss ' em in jimmie' s garbage bag .
don' t do nothin ' stupid , like leavin ' this shit out front for the garbageman to pick up .
don' t worry , we' re taking it with us .
jim , the soap .
vincent .
okay , gentlemen .
you both been to county before , i' m sure .
here it comes .
goddamn !
the water' s fuckin ' cold !
yo !
yo !
yo !

don' t be afraid of the soap .
spread it around .
get ' em there a little bit .
vincent' s hair .
hey , get out of my hair !
come on .
do it , goddamn it !
do it !
uh , um
towel .
you' re dry enough .
toss ' em their clothes .
perfect .
perfect .
we couldn' t have planned this better .
you guys look like
what do they look like , jimmie ?
dorks .
they look like a couple of dorks .
ha ha ha .
they' re your clothes , motherfucker .
come on , gentlemen .
we' re laughing our way right into prison .
don' t make me beg .
okay , gentlemen , let' s get our rules of the road straight .
we' re going to a place called monster joe' s truck and tow .
monster joe and his daughter raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma .
the place is north hollywood , so a few twists and turns aside , we' il be goin ' up hollywood way .
now , i' il drive the tainted car .
jules , you ride with me .
vincent , you follow in my acura .
now , if we come across the path of any john q. laws ,
nobody does a fuckin ' thing ' til i do something .
right .
what did i say ?
don' t do shit unless .
unless what ?
unless you do it first .
spoken like a true prodigy .
how about you , lash larue ?
can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling ?
the gun went off .
i don' t know why .
i' m cool .
i promise you .
fair enough .
now , i drive real fuckin ' fast , so keep up .
if get my car back any different than i gave it ,
monster joe' s gonna be disposing of two bodies .
outta my way , rex .
we cool ?
like it never happened .
all right .
boys , this is raquel .
someday all this will be hers .
hi .
so , what' s with the outfits ?
you guys going to a volleyball game or something ?
i' m takin ' milady out for breakfast .
maybe i could drop you two off .
where do you live ?
redondo .
inglewood .
it' s it' s your future .
i
i see a a cab ride .
move outta the sticks , fellas .
say good night , raquel .
good night , raquel .
i' il see you guys around .
stay outta trouble , you crazy kids .
mr. wolf , i just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work .
yeah , really .
and thank you very much , mr. wolf .
call me winston .
you see that , young lady ?
respect .
respect for one' s elders shows character .
i have character .
because you are a character doesn' t mean that you have character .
wanna share a cab ?
i' d go for some breakfast .
feel like havin ' breakfast with me ?
cool .
i don' t know why , i just thought he' d be european or something .
yeah , he' s about as european as fuckin ' english bob .
i know that now .
but was he cool or what ?
thank you .
totally fuckin ' cool , in control .
didn' t even really get pissed when you were fuckin ' with him ; i was amazed .
want some bacon ?
no , man , i don' t eat pork .
are you jewish ?
i ain' t jewish ; i just don' t dig on swine , that' s all .
why not ?
pigs are filthy animals .
i don' t eat filthy animals .
yeah , but bacon tastes good .
pork chops taste good .
sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie , but i' d never know ...
' cause i wouldn' t eat the filthy motherfuckers .
pigs sleep and root in shit .
that' s a filthy animal .
i ain' t eatin ' nothin ' ain' t got sense enough to disregard its own feces .
what about a dog ?
dog eats its own feces .
i don' t eat dog either .
yeah , but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal ?
i wouldn' t go so far as to call a dog filthy , but they' re definitely dirty .
but a dog' s got personality .
personality goes a long way .
ah , so , by that rationale , if a pig had a better personality , he would cease to be a filthy animal .
is that true ?
we' d have to be talkin ' about one charming motherfuckin ' pig .
i mean , he' d have to be ten times more charming than that arnold on green acres .
oh , man , that' s good .
that' s good , man .
you' re startin ' to lighten up .
you' ve been sittin ' there , all serious and shit .
i just been sittin ' here , thinkin ' .
about what ?
about the miracle we witnessed .
miracle you witnessed .
i witnessed a freak occurrence .
what is a miracle , vincent ?
act of god .
and what' s an act of god ?
when , um , god makes the impossible possible .
but this morning ...
i don' t think qualifies .
hey , vincent .
see , that shit don' t matter .
you' re judging this shit the wrong way .
it could be god stopped the bullets , changed coke to pepsi , found my car keys .
you don' t judge shit like this based on merit .
now , whether or not what we experienced ... was an according to hoyle miracle is insignificant .
but what is significant is , i felt the touch of god .
god got involved .
but why ?
i don' t know why .
but i can' t go back to sleep .
you' re serious .
you' re really thinkin ' about quittin ' .
for life ?
most definitely .
yeah .
fuck .
what you gonna do then ?
well , that' s what i been sitting here contemplating .
first i' m gonna deliver this case to marsellus .
then , basically , i' m just gonna walk the earth .
what you mean , " walk the earth " ?
like caine in kung fu .
walk from place to place , meet people , get in adventures .
and how long do you intend to walk the earth ?
' til god puts me where he wants me to be .
what if he don' t do that ?
if it takes forever , then i' il walk forever .
so you decided to be a bum .
i' il just be jules , vincent .
no more , no less .
no , jules , you decided to be a bum , just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change , who sleep in garbage bins , eat what i throw away .
they got a name for that , jules .
it' s called a bum .
and without a job , a residence or legal tender , that' s what you' re gonna be , man .
you' re gonna be a fuckin ' bum .
look , my friend , this is just where you and i differ .
garon !
coffee !
jules , look , what happened this morning , man , i agree it was peculiar .
but water into wine , l  all shapes and sizes , vincent .
don' t fuckin ' talk to me that way , man .
if my answers frighten you , then you should cease asking scary questions .
i' m gonna take a shit .
let me ask you something .
when did you make this decision ?
when you were sittin ' there eatin ' that muffin ?
yeah .
i was sittin ' here eatin ' my muffin , drinkin ' my coffee , replayin ' the incident in my head , when i had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity .

and when you do it , you do it cool .
you ready ?

yolanda !
i thought you were gonna be cool .
now , when you yell at me , it makes me nervous .
when i get nervous , i get scared .
when motherfuckers get scared , that' s when motherfuckers accidentally get shot .
just know , you hurt him , you die .
well , that seems to be the situation .
but i don' t want that .
and you don' t want that .
and ringo here definitely doesn' t want that .
so let' s see what we can do .
now ... here' s the situation .
normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin ' fried chicken , but you happened to pull this shit while i' m in a transitional period , and i don' t wanna kill you ; i wanna help you .
but i can' t give you this case , ' cause it don' t belong to me .
besides , i been through too much shit over this case this morning ... to just hand it over to your dumb ass .
vincent !
be cool !
yolanda , it' s cool , baby .
get back !
it' s cool !
we still just talkin ' .
come on .
point the gun at me .
point the gun at me .
there you go .
now , vincent , you just hang back ... and don' t do a goddamn thing .
tell her it' s still cool .
it' s still cool , honey bunny .
how we doin ' , baby ?
i i gotta go pee .
i wanna go home .
hang in there , baby .
i' m proud of you .
and ringo' s proud of you .
it' s almost over .
tell her you' re proud of her .
i' m proud of you , honey bunny .
i love you .
i love you too , honey bunny .
now ,
i want you to go in that bag and find my wallet .
which one is it ?
it' s the one that says " bad motherfucker .
that' s it .
that' s my bad motherfucker .
open it up .
take out the money .
count it .
how much is there ?
about 1, 500 dollars .
okay , put it in your pocket .
it' s yours .
now , with the rest of those wallets and the register , that makes this a pretty successful little score , huh ?
jules , you give that fuckin ' nimrod 1, 500 dollars , and i' il shoot him on general principle .
no , yolanda !
yolanda !
he ain' t gonna do a goddamn , motherfuckin ' thing !
vince , shut the fuck up !
shut up !
come on , yolanda .
stay with me , baby .
now , i ain' t givin ' it to him , vincent .
i' m buyin ' something for my money .
wanna know what i' m buyin ' , ringo ?
what ?
your life .
i' m givin ' you that money so i don' t have to kill your ass .
you read the bible , ringo ?
not regularly , no .
well , there' s this passage i got memorized .
ezekiel 25 : 17 .
the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides ... by the inequities of the selfish ... and the tyranny of evil men .
blessed is he who , in the name of charity and good will , shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness , for he is truly his brother' s keeper and the finder of lost children .
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger ... those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers .
and you will know i am the lord ... when i lay my vengeance upon you .
i been sayin ' that shit for years , and if you heard it , that meant your ass .
i never gave much thought to what it meant .
i just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker ... before i popped a cap in his ass .
but i saw some shit this morning made me think twice .
see , now i' m thinkin ' maybe it means ... you' re the evil man , and i' m the righteous man , and mr. 9 millimeter here , he' s the shepherd ... protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness .
or it could mean ... you' re the righteous man , and i' m the shepherd , and it' s the world that' s evil and selfish .
now , i' d like that .
but that shit ain' t the truth .
the truth is , you' re the weak ... and i' m the tyranny of evil men .
but i' m tryin ' , ringo .
i' m tryin ' real hard ... to be the shepherd .
go .
i think we should be leaving now .
yeah , that' s probably a good idea .
