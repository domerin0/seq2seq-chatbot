southern hospitality at its finest .
redneck assholes .

no .
i should tell you that my voice is fairly low and normal speed .
pretty good .
mm hmm .

um , i got it out of my dad' s room , actually .
you can finish it .
i can' t believe they called us stoners .
dickheads .
are you sure you know where we' re going ?
yeah .
there was a map at the gas station .
oh , i' m so tired already .
i' m starving , and i' m being eaten by ants .
are there any on my back ?
no , nothing there .
oh , hey ho !
i call it .
uh , squirrel .
well , you said you were hungry , carly .
i don' t think it' s a squirrel .
it' s a mink .
really ?
how do you know ?
probably ran over it .
in medical school , they make you work on animal cadavers before you get to the real thing .
it' s a mink .
oh .
it' s a mink ?
i need to be in raleigh by 7 : 00 .
hmm .
better get a move on , then .
you know , we should' ve just taken her to new york .
no .
you know how she loves this outdoor stuff .
yeah .
if you ask me , though , nature sucks .
well , the next time she gets dumped , we' il take her to new york .
drop your pants .
what ?
when do people always show up , evan ?
what are we doing ?
consider it an experiment in probability theory .

mmm .
i love you .
i know .

evan ?
evan ?
where are you ?
hey , baby , what are you doing ?

no , nothing .
i' m gonna miss this thing .
why didn' t you just fly ?
i put all of my money into that car back there .
okay , forget eloping , but there is an idea we should discuss about the band for our wedding .
i think we should hire a ... you know , a frank sinatra type , uh , lead singer ... as opposed to a james brown type lead singer ... because , you know , really , let' s be honest , there' s only onejames brown ... and , you know , a faux james brown is really quite intolerable .
evan ?
where are you ?
you pissing or something ?
evan ?
you know , plus he' d be grinding his hips , and my grandmother would be ... yes , revolted but also strangely fascinated in a completely disturbing way ... and , um ...
baby ?

hello . !
hello . !
there' s , uh , nothing like stating the obvious , huh ?
hey , baby , look at this .
whoo !
hey , carly , i think this would be good time for you to confront your fear of ...
don' t !
okay , that is not funny .
look who' s scared now .
sorry .
whatever .
just get me to a motel room ... run me a very hot bath ... and be prepared to provide me with a lot of orgasms .
oh !
i think they need to be alone .
what do you expect ?
they just got engaged .
they' re happy .
it' s a hard thing to find .
yeah .
got it ?
limber tongue .

you' re stupid .
maybe we shouldn' t have left francine and evan .
don' t worry .
they' re fine .
you guys okay ?
super .
