the antichrist ?
i' m just a guy looking for some answers .
hey , you know , pal , ain' t we all ?
things are probably gonna end bad for you tonight , jake .
yeah , i' m starting to get that feeling .
is your life flashing before your eyes ?
honestly ?
just the last three weeks .
it' s not a bad place to start .
calm down , okay ?
i' m sorry .
i lost my head in there , i don' t know what happened .
you fucking shot him , that' s what happened .
what other fucking choice do i have ?
the motherfucker was gonna welch .

i can' t be here , man , do you understand me ?
i can' t fucking be here !
listen to me , all right ?
it went to shit , that happens sometimes .
oh , fuck , man !
you' re not listening , lionel .
we can still get through this , we still have some time , but i need you to use your fucking head , and i need you to trust me .
can you do that ?
let' s go !
come on , let' s hustle it up .
come on , grab his feet , will you ?
lionel , he' s dead , all right ?
maybe you didn' t pull the trigger , but you were standing right there and you saw me do it .
now grab his fucking legs .
tick tock .
hey , you wanna help , then help .
if not , shut your piehole .
your mess !
do me a favor , please , shut your fucking mouth .
my place .
maybe now , you' il shut the fuck up .
please !
you think this kind of shit hasn' t happened here before ?
given , it' s usually on wednesday and usually i tell the cops ,
no , officer , i didn' t get a good look at the shooters .
usually , anyway ...
i swear to god , i didn' t see anything .
you let me go , i won' t say a word , i promise .
don' t get hysterical on us , sweetheart , all right ?
i can' t fucking be here !
then you know what , lionel , maybe you should go .
what about the money ?
what about this situation makes you think
i can answer that question , right now ?
fuck !
fuck !
freeze !
freeze , you motherfucking cocksucking scumbags !
all right , guys , stop waving those things ...
what took you so fucking long ?
jesus christ !
it' s like 100 degrees in here and i' m lying in this shit forever .
what the fuck !
you guys were late , we had to go to a mexican stand off .
we had to go to gunplay .
gentlemen , that isn' t our racket .
we were busy fighting crime .
you' re keeping the streets safe from pedophiles and drug dealers ?
oh !
goddamn it .
i told you , you' re using too much powder , look at my fucking shirt .
i understand , but you know something ?
you don' t get the nice splatter effect .
look at this splatter effect .
the ones with blood come out of your cut .
i can live with that .
hey , jake , when do i get to play the inside ?
gordo plays the inside .
you are the shill , you know that .
yeah , but come on , all i do is cry and get insulted here .
what are you talking about ?
you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do .
big al , does anyone do it better than you ?
come on , we' ve got a good thing going here .
you want to jinx us by changing things ?
yeah , you' re right , i don' t want to jinx anything .
of course i' m right .
here you go , that' s your cut .
thank you .
good work , paisan .
what ?
it' s a lot of cash .
he came up with it awfully quick .
did you see how quickly he got out of here ?
he' s not coming back , it' s over .
okay , fine .
i' ve gotta pinch a loaf .
did anybody mess up the hoop ?
it' s clean .
gentlemen , 10 % , your cut .
enjoy !
you guys got a lot of sack , man .
i' il give you that much .
it' s confidence .
just confidence .
it doesn' t matter what the con is .
insider trading , a line we got at a bookie club , insurance scam , whatever .
you' ve seen the money and you want it .
more of it .
so who cares if you have to bend the rules a little bit ?
as long as nobody gets hurt .
but then somebody does .
tommy suits always said , " a confidence game is like putting on a play , where everyone knows their part .
the inside man , the roper , the shills , everyone , that is , except for the mark .
so now you' re an accomplice in a homicide .
everything you thought you were in control of , just flew out the window , or is dripping down your leg .
you should be running out the door , desperate to forget that this ever happened , and ready to repent your greedy ways .
what about the money ?
then there it is again , that itch .
there' s a guy standing in front of you with a smoking gun , another guy on the floor bleeding all over the place , and all you can do is think about the money .
you' re a sick twisted fuck .
so we gotta make sure we give you the blow off .
we have to make sure that you never ever come looking for us again .
we have to get you off of our backs , forever .
that' s why we give you the fix .
fuck .
fuck !
fuck !
fuck !
lapd' s finest .
half as smart and twice as crooked
as the guy they just chased away .
freeze !
motherfucking scumbags ...
sucking fucking cocksuckers !
grifters .
we all can' t be model citizens such as yourself .
it' s all about the money , isn' t it ?
ain' t it always ?
that' s what makes us run .
what' s your name ?
dutch .
and despite what they say ...
i love that name .
me too .
it can buy you love .
check it out , original leather seats , soft top , and you' re gonna love this , suicide doors .
nice !
it can say everything about you .
it can erase all those things about you , you wish didn' t exist .
it' s alphonse .
i wanna settle up .
no , i haven' t been ducking you .
i told you , i get it .
it can make you think you' re on top of the world .
and if you believe that money can do all that for you , you are the perfect mark .
oops !
wasn' t it jack kerouac who said ,
if you own a rug , you own too much .
i don' t necessarily like kerouac , and driving cross country isn' t my idea of a good time , but the guy' s got a point .
... three messages .
hey , it' s monica , bill .
i' m still dizzy from the other night .
call me .
hi scott , just thought i' d call you and tell you i' m back .
you know the number , it' s kate , by the way .
bruce , it' s cheryl , if you don' t want to see me , just say so .
but this is the last time i' m calling .
if you' ve got nothing , you' ve got nothing to lose .
but when it comes to money , whether it' s finding it or losing it , you just have to remember how much of it is just luck .
oops !
just dumb fucking luck .
mr. dolby ?
mr. king would like a word with you .
now ?
right now ?
we have a car waiting .
hello .
you better get over to al' s now .
for what ?
hello ?
nothing .
who the fuck ? !
there' s a couple hundred bucks on his dresser .
all of his shit' s here .
this definitely wasn' t a random thing .
is it ever a random thing ?
shit , al .
what did you do ?
let' s just think about this ...
this fucking town , man .
jesus christ , i had a bad feeling about la .
didn' t i say that ?
this damn fucking town !
gordo , now is not the time for that , all right ?
i' m sorry , i' m just a little ...
jesus christ .
look at what they did to him , jake .
right in the middle of his egg foo yung .
think they know about us ?
what if they get to us too ?
don' t start freaking out , okay ?
let' s get al out of here first .
miles , get a blanket or something .
no , we' re going to leave him right here .
what are you , high ?
we' re not leaving al here .
grab that end , now .
grab it , miles !
miles , pick up the table and put it back .
gordo , let go of the fucking rug .
i said we' re leaving him here .
drop it .
fuck you !
how long have we worked with this fucking guy ?
i' m not going to just fucking leave him here !
all right ?
gordo , get a fucking grip .
we' re leaving him here .
big al used to send money to his father , a vietnam vet slowly losing his mind in a va hospital in cleveland .
al was like that .
now you coming ?
that' s why al never played the inside .
there he is .
so what do you hear ?
well , lionel dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night .
they just pulled him out of the silverlake reservoir .
now i know why he was such a good rope .
i mean , cash , that much , and we never had to put him on the send ?
turns out this fucking mope is an accountant for the king .
the what ?
who' s that ?
the cash we fleeced off him was collection money .
bookies , pushers , you know , whatever .
he was supposed to take that money and give it back to the king earlier yesterday , like he does every thursday , except this time that fucking stenad figured he could make a little something off of us and still get the money back to king before anybody says , " boo .
okay , what' s a king ?
currently ?
a very large type pole stuck right up our asses , miles .
mob ?
no .
no .
independent .
winston king .
he likes to call himself " the king .
how' d they get to al ?
it' s beautiful .
last night al calls some bookie out in redondo , tells them he' s got the cash to settle up .
because , apparently he' s been ducking this guy for like a month .
classic fucking al , right ?
so the bookie asks where he' s got this money , all of a sudden .
does al tell this guy that he just cashed a fucking bar mitzvah bond ?
that he' s been giving head for 20 bucks a pop ?
no .
no .
the fucking idiot starts going on and on about how this job he just pulled , how he fleeced dolby ... how he fleeced ...
you pissed we didn' t get credit ?
no , no , no .
that was the only semi fucking smart thing he said .
except , anybody that' s ever met big al knows the only thing he' s comfortable doing alone is eating .
so this guy tells that guy , that guy tells some other guy , eventually it gets back to someone who works for the king and ...
shazaam .
any idea who the shooter was ?
specifically ?
i don' t know .
but , i' m sure they' re looking for us , too .
all right , just an idea , let' s divvy up the cash and split .
excuse me .
are you new ?
is that the thing ?
is he new ?
miles , this guy holds a grudge better than my ex mother in law .
you remember that moshe macelli ?
that jew italian guy from boston ?
they used to call him matzo mazzarelli ?
remember that ?
the guy with the face spaz ?
it' s called a facial twitch , miles .
and the guy was not born like that , you know .
five years ago , matzo was turf fixing for the king at santa anita , and he skimmed two grand before skipping town .
five years later king finally catches up to him , keeps him chained in his fucking bathroom for like five days .
oh , god .
now just say the word king , and he spits up all over himself .
jesus !
pathetic .
even words like vi king and shrin king , they set the guy off .
that' s a five year grudge over $2000 .
so we go talk to him .
whoa , whoa , whoa , you wanna give the money back ?
i didn' t say that .
pittsburgh .
madrone .
pittsburgh is where it' s happening .
bird flew into my house last night , too .
not a good sign , gordo .
the euclid was our place .
gordo fleeced the deed off some jack off in a card game .
we used it every now and then for a rag , but mostly it was our office .
our power point .
what are you doing ?
where the hell' s that going ?
we want insurance ?
jesus christ , miles .
i' m just asking .
just mail it .
yeah , i' m looking for the king , please .
just tell him it' s regarding an accounting problem .
yeah , he' il know .
hollywood and vine ?
okay .
when ?
two hours from now .
but just me .
fuck that .
we' re going too .
let' s all just put our dicks back in our pants for a second , okay ?
is this the best thing to do , jake ?
how do you know the king is going to let you walk , jake ?
' cause i' m getting a ride .
don' t be dicking around in there , okay ?
and if he shoots you or stabs you or causes you to bleed profusely , call a cab , ' cause your ass ain' t getting back in here .
thanks , guys .
we appreciate your punctuality .
mr. king is expecting you .
lupus !
you said to pat him down , so i' m patting him down .
it only takes a moment to be polite .
my apology , mr. vig .
if you wouldn' t mind ?
so you the guy that got big al ?
nope .
mr. king farms out that kind of work .
please .
after you .
wait with the ladies .
harlin .
okay , now you see that right there ?
find out who she is .
make a note .
i think it' s channel 42 or 3 .
a little harder .
the girls are here and the kid .
also got the seldin brothers with a shipment .
bring them in .
which ?
whatever .
the brothers , the girl or the kid ?
oh that' s good .
whoever .

jake , ladies .
harlin , i think i bet that dog .

hey .
well , look it here .
hi , girls .
hi .
so , are you two together ?
we' re sisters .
i like sisters !
jake , i can' t quite see .
why don' t you move a little bit , so that i can check them out then you can check them out ?
thanks .
sisters , huh ?
mm hmm .
and you' re over 18 ?
yeah .
harlin , let' s see what the sisters can do .
put them in the booth .
ladies .
oh , by the way , he had an escort .
lapd .
that' s a little overreacting , i' m not gonna hurt you .
it' s just a little insurance , that' s all .
uh huh .
so , they' re on the take for you .
shh .
you must be pretty good if you got cops driving you around .
is that because you look so innocent , and you' re kind of cute there aren' t you ?
yeah , it' s something like that .
so what do you do , tiger ?
you just con people out of their money ?
there is actually some technique to it .
you mean , like ... style .
yeah , it helps , don' t you think ?
no , style is at the end of my list , i' il tell you why , when i was a young man like you just starting out , my first big score , this guy we robbed .
i think his name was ...
chinatown schmidt !
it was nothing big , my end was about $800 .
the first thing i did , i go out and get myself a suit , right ?
yeah , i looked good .
it was like white .
it was white .
it was white white .
white , white , white , white , white !
oh , i looked good , man .
i walked down the street , everybody was checking me out .
male and female .
i' m sure they did .
anyway , the first day i wore it out ,
october , it was still hot out .
we were kicking back in malibu and chinatown schmidt , right ?
he catches up with us , so two guys roll by and boom , boom , boom , boom !
boom , boom , boom , boom !
six of us , scatter , man .
the dust settles .
everybody' s checking their fingers and their toes .
and who is the one guy that got hit , sailor ?
you know why ?
white suit !
i was the first thing they saw , i was the first thing they aimed at .
i was the first thing they hit .
so what did i learn that day , jake ?
don' t wear white after labor day , maybe ?
no .
sometimes , jake , style can get you killed .
mr. king , the girls are ready !
oh great !
wait , sport , you' re gonna love this .
you ever been here before ?
no , it' s not really my thing .
oh , you don' t know that .
tuesday we got disco night ,
wednesday is that electronic music shit ,
thursdays are gay and lesbian night .
that is very tasteful , by the way .
ow !
ow !
ow !
lupus , i want you to get me ...
lupus !
goddamn it , you' re looking at them or you' re working for me ?
i want you to get me an espresso , please , and tell that bitch to give me back my slippy dips .
come on .
now !
let me ask you something , why one of my guys ?
why lionel dolby ?
my six year old nephew could con anything out of that dude .
why ?
look , if we knew dolby was connected to you , we' d never have gone near him , so i apologize for any inconvenience .
honest mistake , all right ?
it' s just something between two guys that don' t know each other yet .
so we' re gonna make an exchange of the money and all will be forgiven .
isn' t that right ?
no .
that i won' t do .
won' t ?
you won' t .
you won' t .
i want you to look very hard at me , motherfucker , and tell me why .
let me rephrase that .
that i can' t do .
because a , i don' t have the money , and b , you killed one of my guys .
one of your guys .
that' s four spot , right ?
yeah .
four .
one of your guys , huh ?
i gotta take a pill , or i' m all over the place .
this is confidential , right ?
yeah .
mm !
hey !

they can' t hear me .
harlin , get them outta there , goddamn it .

shit , man .
how do you like that ?
they' re sisters .
let me ask you something .
i want a straight answer now .
you did not know that dolby was connected to me ?
you heard me before .
but it' s so important that you don' t stray from the truth in this one little part .
i didn' t know .
you' re a good grifter , man .
it' s hard to tell when you' re lying .
but i' m getting there .
come here , girls .
now listen , it' s the first time i' ve ever put girls in the booth .
usually , they work their way up .
you' re gonna go work on your routine , you know why ?
because you' re saying that you are sisters .
mm mm , we are sisters .
shh .
we' re very close .
let me talk .
let me talk .
you don' t like what we' re doing ?
of course i like what you' re doing but i like it done with artistry , with grace , and that means , if you' re gonna eat each other , you must find a way to do it tastefully , okay ?
these are people here , they' ve got families , all right ?
okay .
you understand ?
then go work !
go on .
go on !
ladies .
tell me this , how are you and i gonna resolve our shit ?
i get you what i owe you , plus interest , by going on the grift for you .

and that' s looking very very good .
and that' s your life line , going all the way down ...

it means that at one point you could have a little trouble .
but it' s up to you to make it better .
i want you to talk to me and i want you to make me happy .

i like to think so .

morgan price ?
yes .
impossible .
why ?
' cause you can' t get to him .
he' s too big .
you got to me .
yeah , but we got to you because ...
what ?
you were a fluke , a mistake .
that' s a good answer .
why morgan price ?
' cause he' s very important to me .
lupus !

* my name is dita *
* i' il be your mistress tonight *
* i' d like to put you in a trance ... *
excuse me , miss ?
miss !
i think you dropped something .
you know you' re good , but you' re not that good .
i spotted that lift from across the club .
wait ?
you don' t recognize me ?
tony , could you get my car ?
sure !
you really don' t remember me , do you ?
should i ?
oh , right .
that' s good .
so , you' re interested in a little work ?
you couldn' t afford me .
not with $27 and a maxed out visa , john .
or is it tom or bill ?
hard to tell with so many ids .
yeah , well , the name' s jake .
and don' t flatter yourself , sweetheart .
that' s one thing i never had to pay for , and i don' t consider it work .
guess you got the wrong girl then .
do me a favor , take a deep breath and count to 10 .
i' m talking about a grift , and it pays well .
unless you think you' re gonna get rich jerking off geriatrics in that place .
i didn' t know you cared .
keep the wallet .
we' re even .
take a deep breath , count to 10 , and ... go fuck yourself !
look , it pays well .
six figures .
all you gotta do is play a part , do a little acting .
you think you can handle that ?
why me ?
you don' t even know me .
' cause what i' ve seen , i liked .
and i got a good feeling about you .
hasn' t anyone ever said that to you before ?
no .
thanks , tony .
you bet !
but , i' il think about it .
all right , i think it will be worth your while .
make a wish .
11 : 11 , make a wish .
that' s twice !
i can see why you liked her .
yeah , i liked her a lot .
and that was it , we had our crew .
now all we needed was the con .
bottoms .
oh ...
oh well .
shit !
what' s up , guys ?
who' s the mope ?
this is lupus .
he works with the king and now he' s gonna be part of our crew .
i' m here to make sure things go smoothly .
anybody got a light ?
and this is lily .
she' s the new shill i was telling you about .
whoa .
whoa , whoa , whoa ...
hold the fucking phone , what is this ?
are we playing a con , or are we doing a rendition of " our town " ?
gordo , trust me .
we need the help on this one .
our new mark ?
morgan price .
why ?
because , that' s who the king wants us to fleece .
and besides , the price is perfect .
i' m not supposed to wait for you , you' re supposed to wait for me .
his old man was a big time mob attorney .
which makes him a second generation crook .
when he dropped dead , price carried on the family tradition , by opening a one stop shopping center for money laundering and low interest corporate fraud .
well , fuck him !
almost $1 billion gets washed through his shop every year , so we know he' s got the money .
it' s just a matter of getting to it .
how much are we going after ?
$5 million .
we can only hold the king at 150 .
i know .
that' s why we don' t go after him directly .
first , we find a doable mark in price' s bank , a mid level employee .
we meet him with papers , inquiring about a corporate loan .
our guy then fudges numbers in the right places .
moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom , depending upon what we need .
our loan is approved .
on the given day , the money' s wired into a corporate account in an offshore bank .
that same day , i show up in belize with the proper id , and corporate papers to make the withdrawal .
um mm .
what ?
what is it , miles ?
i' m just thinking out loud here ... but $5 million in a briefcase ?
good point .
it' s bank policy not to release this money in cash ,
' cause it' s under a corporate account .
so we then cash the check at another bank .
any major airport' s gonna be too hard to control .
lax is out .
so we use ontario .
mid level hub with direct international flights .
40 minutes outside la .
this is the most important part , you can' t just walk into the united states with a suitcase full of cash , without evoking the words " cavity search .
that' s why we need someone on the inside at customs .
then we disappear .
now this might just be me , but that is hands down the dumbest fucking idea i' ve ever heard .
people have tried this before , jake .
it' s never worked .
teddy fraiser and his crew got nailed in vancouver last year .
it' s never worked before , because , a , they didn' t flush the bank enough ,
b , their corporate papers were for shit , and c , unlike us , they did not have somebody on the inside at customs .
yeah , or d , it' s a dumb fucking idea !
hey !
what do you fucking suggest , miles ?
you wanna run ?
we never had a problem with that , before .
we never had a fucking problem like this before .
yes , we have , okay ?
and we would have been beautiful about it .
we would have had a bucket of fried chicken , delivered to the king with a nice
kiss my ass card attached to it , and we would have moved on until the next local putz caught on .
we' re getting too old to run , miles .
yeah well , we' re still a little too young for san quentin .
look , i' m ...
i mean , are you pissed off about al ?
look at me .
trust me , i' m pissed too .
but i' m not 25 to life pissed .
look , i' m getting clear of this .
all right ?
so if you don' t want to do it for the fucking principle , do it for the money .
gordo ?
yeah , jake , whatever .
there' s no whatever with this one .
you' re either with me or against me .
no third position .
i' m in .
aw , what a relief .
oh , fuck .
i agreed with miles , it was hands down , a dumb fucking idea .
but they bought in , now i had to deliver ...
yeah , it' s vig .
and i needed help .
what are we gonna do with this stuff ?
i mean , heroin .
what do you do with heroin ?
you sell it .
to who ?
don' t be a knucklehead .
how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer' s drugs to another drug dealer ?
if vig is right , we' re looking at 100 , 150 .
you think it' s a good idea ?
we never done this shit before .
well , what is he gonna do , file a missing drug report ?
hey if it works out , we could turn the guy over a few times .
i hope so , bro ' .
i took my daughter to the orthodontist , yesterday .
150 bucks to tighten those bitches up .
took him five minutes .
then he said it wasn' t even covered .
it' s cosmetic .
the plan doesn' t cover cosmetic .
i had a cap put in here , right ?
my fucking dentist tells me , " you' re not covered for that .
bullshit cosmetics !
i got a freaking tooth split in half here , all right ?
write that shit in as a cavity or something .
did he ?
yeah , he did .
fucking department got the bullshit dental plan .
that' s our man , right there .
red bag , right ?
is that the guy ?
let' s go .
hands up !
hey , hey , whoa , whoa , whoa .
what the fuck you got ?
get on the ground .
so , how did you get caught ?
tommy suits used to say that in any con , sooner or later somebody' s gonna start asking the right questions .
usually , it takes a little longer .

i think we should ditch him .
no , we need him and dummy up .
here he comes .
ah , here he is .

what' s the matter with that ?
manly , all right , wise guy ?
that' s cute .
you know this is a major metropolitan city , brother .
public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda .
you know what you can get off a toilet seat or a doorknob ?
you wanna run down the list ?
hepatitis .

influenza .
the fucking flesh eating disease .
i' m eating .
yeah , we noticed .

miles !
we' re gonna need you to find us a mark inside of price' s bank .
somebody we can work with .
gordo , we' re gonna need papers .
corporate insurance , a letter of intent , the whole nine .
all fugazze ?
no , no , no
corporate papers have got to be legit .
we' re all gonna need new ids .
you gotta make sure they' re clean .
go talk to suits , and he' il hook you up .
what about customs ?
don' t worry about customs ,
i' il take care of that .
we' re gonna need some start up cash , first .
lupus , you think the king would be willing to bank us ?
you already owe him .
lupus , we need a banker for this .
we can' t do this job without a banker .
gordo , do we need a banker ?
i think so , yes .
i think we need a banker .
i don' t know , man
you could try .
he' s not gonna listen to me .
i bet if you talk to him , loosen him up ,
maybe he' il listen to you .
all right !
i' il try , okay ?
don' t do us any favors , all right ?
jesus , join the team !
so , you guys are good ?
you know what you need to do ?
yeah .

i' m not finished .
she' s not finished .
what' s wrong with you ?
where' s your manners ?
nice !
you know why ?
because it' s real .
you' re licking each other .
feels good ?
feels so good .
all right , that' s it ... what ?
what , what ?
jake is here ,
he wants you to stake him a couple hundred grand .
no , he' s supposed to be getting me money , not costing me money .
he says we need it .
and i gotta say , boss ,
this guy' s pretty sharp , you know ?
look at me , look at me .
you' re getting a crush on him ?
what are you talking about ?
don' t let him get into your head , ' cause he' s a charmer .
you tell him to wait a minute and then you bring him in .
he' s right behind you .
get outta here .
get outta here .
you' re starting to scare me , sport .
harlin !
200k ?
isn' t that more than you owe me ?
you' re just gonna have to trust me on this , all right ?
oh , no .
you' re a day late on trust .
i think that what he' s trying to say is that he' il ...
oh , oh , oh , oh .
you brought her for a reason , didn' t you , booster ?
let' s listen to her .
no , why don' t you listen up ?
even though i' m running the show for you ,
i' m still running the show .
so we' re gonna put an end to the scooter junior skippy sport tiger booster bullshit .
the name is jake .
what do you say you get the add under control ?
you look me in the eye when i' m talking to you .
what' s your name , honey ?
her name is lily .
booster , have i ever referred to you as honey ?
have i , scooter ?
it' s a common mistake that jake is making when he says add .
what he really means is adhd , for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , see ?
the important word is the h ,
hyperactivity .
i don' t understand , why do you let her do that if you care about her ?
it' s poison , see ?
feel my heart .
go ahead .
i bet it beats twice as fast as yours .
go on feel it .
i' m fine , thanks .
oh , come on .
will you feel my heart ?
i' m not gonna bite you .
god , you feel good .
like a trip hammer , right ?
see ?
much faster ... than yours .
why am i enjoying this so much , jake ?
because
i feel like she is too .
i' m sorry , i know that was tasteless , dear .
i was just trying to make a point to jake , okay ?
what do you say you get your add under control , and we get to the fucking point ?
ooh , i think jake is referring to my medication , which i thought was confidential .
jacob , come on , come on .
you know why i take that stuff .
because if i don' t , i become hyper , or primitive , right ?
or impulsive .
you never know when i' m going to lose it .
now listen to me , okay ?
hey !
i' m not a violent man .
i like to think i am above that , right ?
you took my money and now you' re asking for more .
and i' m gonna give you ...
i' m gonna give you what you' re asking for ,
which is , how much ?
tell me again .
200 .
200 , how much is that altogether ?
including what you took from me the first time ?
350 .
oh , that' s very good , you' re smart , aren' t you ?
you told me you were smart .
you' re a smart , smart , smart guy !
so be smarter , huh ?
don' t get hurt .
don' t scare me .
you' ve got a good , healthy , long life ahead of you .
i like you , now say , " we' re set .
" we' re set .
say it like you like me too .
come on , you can do it .
say , " we' re set " like you like me .
we' re set .
okay , now i want you to take your lovely ,
lovely lady home .
oh my god , you' re beautiful .
let' s go .
don' t you ever , ever
let anyone stand behind me , without me knowing .
you hear me ?
you understand me ?
so the king gave you the money .
now , we just needed to find our guy in price' s bank .
what you' re looking for in a mark is someone whose weaknesses you can exploit .
michelle strigo , loan officer .
guy like me , people like that ,
i tell you what you' re looking for without even meeting you .
you fucking asshole !
what the fuck is wrong with you ?
you cocksucker !
it' s like a personal ad you wear over your head .
she' s not gonna work .
you sure ?
jay housler , vp of international finance .
no .
leon ashby , vp of corporate loans .
what you' re looking for in a mark is someone who has nothing to lose .
no friends .
no family .
no life .
you' re looking for a guy who doesn' t own a rug .
oh yeah , he' s perfect .
you sure ?
hey , i' m sure .
ashby was the right mark .
now i needed to see if lily was the right shill , so i tested her .
one watch engraved , " to carolyn ,
happy graduation counselor , love , mom and dad .
good .
one bracelet engraved ,
to annie , happy 25th anniversary , love , tom .
perfect !
i' il be right back , mr. lewis .
okay , thank you .
excuse me , i think you have something on hold for me .
do you have a ticket ?
i lost it but the name is hanson .
okay thanks a lot .
mr. lewis , right ?
yes ?
jake hanson .
i go to law school with your daughter carolyn .
we met a couple of times , before .
oh , of course , jake !
it' s good to see you again .
good to see you too .
you remember ...
lily !
this beautiful woman is my wife .
lily , this is carolyn' s father .
oh , nice to meet you .
pleasure , i' m sure .
so , what brings you down from stanford ?
taking advantage of the long weekend ?
yeah , we' re ...
it' s our first anniversary !
congratulations !
that' s great .
carolyn is down for the weekend too .
really ?
mm mm , yeah .
maybe you can do me a favor then .
we split the cost on a couple of books , last semester , and i never got an opportunity to pay her back ,
i' il just write you a check .
there' s nothing for hanson .
if we had a ticket , i could check the computer .
but yesterday , my wallet and my wife' s purse were stolen , and the ticket was in my wallet .
maybe , you could check again .
jesus , where did this happen ?
we' re staying at the peninsula ,
i think it might have been the housekeeping staff .
but jake has a little more faith in humanity than i do .
he hates me saying it , but i think it' s true .
you have to be so careful these days .
you sure do .
honey , i' m just gonna go and pick out a wallet .
it was nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
there you are mr. lewis .
good .
i' m sorry , sir , still nothing .
may i ask what it was ?
it' s a shame , it was a pair of ... a pair of diamond earrings .
actually , it' s just like those .
we have those in stock .
oh great .
let me write you a check only with the proper id .
yeah , i understand that but like i just explained to you , my wallet was ... this is sort of a very special day for my wife and i , it being our first anniversary .
she thinks we' re here to pick up something for my mother , but i wanted to surprise her with something special .
so if you think you can make an exception today , just this one time .
i' m sorry .
thank you .
please , tell carolyn i said hello and pass the note for her .
i sure will .
it was good to see you again .
good to see you .
look , jake , why don' t you write me a check , and let me put the earrings on my credit card ?
is that all right with you ?
if you' d be willing to do that , that would be great .
good .
please .
mr. lewis , thanks again .
you bet , jake .
happy anniversary .
all right ?
now that' s how you pull a con .
so smile like you just got a present from the man of your dreams .
thank you !
you' re welcome , now let' s give it a strong finish , all right ?
he' s gone .
oh yeah .
i gotta go get a haircut .
hey , how you doing ?
hey guys , good to see you , man .
what' s up , boss ?
right here .
that' s good .
what are you having ?
i' m gonna go light ,
i' m gonna get the chicken and rib combo .
that' s light ?
yeah , i' m not getting the coleslaw .
so , what' s good here ?
who the fuck are you ?
special agent gunther butan .
special agent ?
i' m looking for jake vig .
who ?
who ?
the invisible man .
the specter , the spook , the ghost .
but then the other day , like a gift , a buddy of his , a crew member ,
alphonse moorely ... you know alphonse moorely .
he wakes up with a hole in his head .
look , special agent ... what' s your name ?
butan !
i got a pretty good sense of humor
like most people .
really , you' ve a sense of humor ?
yeah , i do .
so if this is some kind of a fucking joke ,
i' m not into this shit !
a joke ? !
a couple of years ago , i' m working undercover on a case that jake vig is involved with .
he' s running some sort of scam importing merchandise for some guy in tampa .
and i got close , real close , and he knew it .
in order to let me know , and to rub it in , he sent me this tie .
since then , i' ve been following him , from chicago to denver to salt lake city , to phoenix and i' ve been wearing this tie ever since , because it keeps me motivated .
that' s a real nice tie .
i don' t know if it says , " special agent .
you know what it says ?
it says ,
you can' t catch me , so fuck you .
so fuck you .
and fuck you !
hey !
temper' s a sign of weakness .
temper' s a sign of weakness .
hey man , can we get you a glass of water ?
i' m working at this temper management issue .
my doc says i should stay calm , because i might do or say something
that i might regret later .
look , special agent ...
sell one drug dealer' s drugs to another drug dealer ?
hey , hey , can you put that away ?
wow !
hey , hey , hey ...
let' s take a walk .
let' s go for a walk .
now here is the deal ...
you guys are gonna help me catch jake vig .
whatever he' s into next , you guys are gonna be into .
and whatever you' re into , i' m into .
this fucking gun is killing my back .
in exchange , i' m gonna make sure you guys are cleared of any past associations with vig as part of a cross departmental investigation , and that home movie i got , i' il make sure that it doesn' t move its way into internal affairs .
who knows ?
this prick has been on the wish list so long , you two guys , might even get a promotion .
what the fuck are you getting out of all this ?
peace of mind .
i might even get a chance to get rid of this fucking tie !
why are you looking at me that way , lloyd ?
not everybody is on the take .
if you feds are so hot for this guy , why don' t you just let us go out ?
we' il bring him in , that' s it .
a fox isn' t a fox until he' s caught in the henhouse .
oh nice .
what is that , an analogy ?
a metaphor .
actually , it' s neither but it is a good deal .
you guys go clean , i get peace of mind , and better yet , lloyd' s daughter gets to keep her braces , and have that winning smile , just like her daddy .
one more thing , you guys can' t be running around with heroin in your car .
let me tell you something about butan .
he' s just as crooked as the next guy .
you' d think he' d have something better to do with taxpayer dollars .
well , cue the fucking violins .
come on , man , it' s getting cold out here .
it was all in play .
everything !
and with a little luck , we' re about to land the mark .
where the hell is she ?
i have no idea .
she' s 10 minutes late .
luck' s a funny thing .
especially the bad .
she' s nice .
black cats , breaking a mirror ,
breathe on a match .
it' s about time .
believe it .
believe it all .
but if you really want to talk about bad luck , redheads .
you have got to be fucking kidding me .
shit .
lizzie borden , axe murderer ;
judas , betrayer ;
shirley vig , abandoner .
nice to see you too .
do you have any idea what you' ve done ?
any idea ?
what is with the hair ?
what ?
you told me to change it .
but the fucking grand poohbah of all jinxes , a bird in your house .
a bird enters your house , it means death .
what about this then ?
what' s with the scarf with the birds ?
i mean , do you know what that means ?
do you know what that means ?
you have just put a mother of a jinx on us .
gordo , can you believe this ?
oy vey .
we' re dead .
we' re dead .
did i miss something , guys ?
sweetheart , it' s the red hair .
it' s bad luck .
it' s not like she' s a real redhead , jake .
look , it doesn' t matter , all right ?
you can' t fool bad luck , you can' t get by on a technicality .
you can' t trick karma .
you just fucked us .
so much for that good feeling , huh ?
that' s what i get for putting a chick on the team , right ?
gordo .
burn that .
lupus !
think fast .
lily , hold on a second , will you ?
excuse me .
is this seat taken ?
no .
please .
thanks .
oh , excuse me , i' m sorry i' m late , but i' m not that late .
you didn' t have to give away my seat .
i didn' t know you were coming .
i didn' t know .
sorry .
no problem .
thanks for playing along .
i had to sit down for awhile .
tough day ?
brutal day .
what are you drinking ?
maker' s mark , on the rocks .
his rocks , mine straight up .
you got it .
my name is leon , leon ashby .
oh , god .
i' m so sorry .
i' m overbearing and rude .
lily .
lily finn .
so what do you do ?
it' s more like , what don' t i do ?
it' s a long story .
well , we' re getting drinks .
what happened ?
my partners and i are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company .
we tried the venture capitalist route , but since the bubble burst on dot coms ...
you' re a few years off the mark .
a lot of bubbles were burst .
yeah .
optimists that we are , we thought we' d try our luck with a straight corporate loan .
there you go .
thank you .
oh , no , no , i can get this .
on me .
for the seat .
chin chin .
so we' ve been meeting with banks all day .
it' s amazing how many ways they can say no without ever actually saying the word .
typically , a corporate loan is a fairly simple matter .
but you do have to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery .
let me guess , your bubble didn' t burst .
no , no , nothing like that .
i work in a bank .
really ?
i wish we' d met eight hours ago .
good evening , gentlemen .
oh , my partners are here .
we have dinner plans .
oh , well , uh ...
thank you for the drink .
oh , you' re welcome .
i was just going to ask if you' d like to join us .
sure .
okay .
so she got one leg out from under him , now we had to lean .
so then miles , god bless him , he walks right into the fucking creative director' s office and he says ,
i' m sorry this program is for shit .
no , no .
and then he throws like a thousand pages of code
all over the fucking guy' s office !
this is our boss , all right ?
so he kicks miles and i out of the office , he' s screaming and yelling ,
you' re fired .
your whole fucking team is fired .
now he' s looking for lily , he' s looking for lupus ,
and of course he can' t find gordo .
that' s the best part .
he cannot find gordo , okay ?
so what happens ?
he finally finds ...
whoa , whoa , whoa ...
you don' t have to tell this part .
he' s in the bathroom .
so he kicks down the stall room door , and starts screaming at the top of his lungs .
and there' s gordo , his pants around the ankles ,
pc world " mag in hand , and he' s punching the cloud .
i' m sorry .
spanking .
frankly , i was spanking .
and it was a fucking traumatizing event , because i haven' t been able to use a public restroom since that day .
me neither .
i swear to god .
gordo' s got some issues .
he' s got some issues .
and let' s not forget , the great thing that did come from that day was we said , " enough !
that' s the day we started our own business and said goodbye
to shithead bosses .
so ...
hear , hear .
i really admire you guys taking a chance like that .
leon here works at a bank .
what bank did you say it was ?
price trust .
no shit , really ?
talk about shithead bosses .
now that' s gotta be a trip .
what' s he like to work for ?
oh , you know .
he' s okay .
really ?
oh , come on !
well , he' s a ... he' s just a fucking shithead .
what can i tell you ?
so what do you do over there at price ?
i' m the vp in charge of corporate loans .
wow .
we haven' t met anyone of your level before .
vp .
wait , so that means it' s you and then the p.
give that man a nobel prize .
well done .
genius .
yes , that' s right .
here' s where a little research comes in handy .
corporate banks give out vp titles like calendars .
it' s a small lie , but now we' re sure he' s playing .
then maybe you can help explain to us what' s so difficult
about getting a corporate loan ?
well , normally , nothing .
but a tech firm right now ?
people are really scared .
people are scared because they lack vision .
present company excluded , of course .
a bank does need to know where its money' s gonna come from .
that is true .
we know where we' re getting our money back from .
but therein lies our catch 22 .
i don' t follow .
well ...
jake , come on .
no , it' s all right .
leon here is one of the good guys .
right ?
now what i' m gonna tell you is in complete confidence .
it does not leave this fucking table .
sure .
fine .
you know how the dot commers did what they did , right ?
in what way ?
how they made their money .
essentially , they start with an idea , shop it around town , raise a little capital , and then sold it to a bigger company ,
like a microsoft or an oracle or an intel .
you know , whatever .
that' s half right there .
the beauty of it was , they sold it before the thing was even real .
so you' ve got the bigger company already set up to buy the thing .
they just want to see that it works .
so these guys go out , get some start up capital , make it work , and then sell for five or six times the initial loan .
they' re delicious .
but you need a letter of intent .
exactly .
and that' s our catch 22 .
we can' t really go out and talk about it , because if it' s public , potentially we start a bidding war , and that' s considered a breach of etiquette .
kills the deal .
however , we wait too long , and we' re not considered hot anymore .
and you have this letter of intent ?
yes we do .
we' re applying the dot com model to a different product .
yeah .
but the dot coms failed .
yeah , but that' s only ...
no , with all due respect .
it ...
that' s going to be a really tough sell .
i mean , you guys have a real battle on your hands .
that' s bullshit .
lupus .
look , sorry , mr. ashby .
i didn' t mean anything .
but i just don' t think you can argue with the success of the business model .
it was really an overextension of the model to what turned out to be a limited consumer demand that caused the dot com collapse .
now , applied to a proper product , with a solid consumer base , the model still holds up .
he may be right .
let me be straight with you , all right ?
we' re this close to cutting somebody in on the action , if they' d be willing to help .
we just need to find somebody with some balls .
shall we order another round ?
yeah .
lupus , nice save in there .
i' m very impressed .
poor bastard never knew what hit him .
jesus christ , i almost felt sorry for the guy .
i gotta go work off some of this adrenaline .
i have an in on a card game with some hollywood studio dipshits .
anybody want a piece ?
i' m going home .
i' il go .
jake ?
no , i' m good .
are you sure ?
yeah .
oh , lupus , you should come .
you' re gonna love these guys .
bunch of fucking knobs .
hey , lupus .
when this is all over , you' il let us know who the king put on big al , right ?
you gonna have time ?
i' il find the time .
you want to go , don' t you ?
for a couple hundred bucks ?
not interested .
you' d do it for free .
you' re almost drooling .
you like the rush .
it' s not about the rush .
it' s just a job .
it' s what i do .
your mother not breast feed you or something ?
you asking me if i got something to prove ?
do you ?
not in that repressed anger way .
i get the feeling you could' ve bullshitted your way into anything .
why this ?
i' m good at it .
lying , cheating , manipulating .
it all came very naturally to me .
no , it' s more than that .
the thrill of it ?
i mean , didn' t you find it exciting tonight ?
the way you were working that guy ashby ... flirting , giving him your sweet little smile , brushing up against him , occasionally touching him ,
i have a feeling you were getting off on that tonight .
all i did was smile and shake my ass .
yeah , but you did it very well .
soon enough you' il have more to do and i have a feeling you' il be good at that too .
how do you know ?
intuition .
she had you tempting fate .
my old man and his buddies from work used to play the same lotto numbers every week .
i mean the same numbers for 16 years .
one day he gets pissed , decides he' s going to play his own number .
they then hit the lucky seven for 3 . 5 million without him .
that' s fate for you .
i guess he passed on that unlucky asshole gene .
turn around .
you should have trusted me , jake .
yeah , apparently so .
everything looks in order .
you know , leon , we' re going to have to move quickly here .
i know .
it won' t go unnoticed .
what' s this ?
let' s call that a convincer .
we' re going to need to slow down a bit .
you' re worried about recouping the loan , we got the letter of intent .
no , it' s ...
i understand that .
what i' m trying to ... what i mean to say is ... what i' m wondering about is ... is my cut .
and there it is .
ashby gets the itch .
2 % .
of five million .
we' re gonna make it back three or four times over .
by the time anyone catches on , the loan' s already been repaid .
you didn' t do anything wrong except speed things up .
all you need to do for your cut , is put some paperwork through , push a button tomorrow .
yeah , but there were other factors .
yeah , factors that weren' t clear to me until now .
what do you got ?
we got jack shit .
i' m not a confrontational man by nature , but you guys are gonna have to start working with me .
we haven' t heard from vig .
we don' t know if he wants to cut us in on this shit he' s got going down with the king .
maybe you two guys need to be a little more pro active , lloyd .
you gotta make him think you' re gonna keep me off his back .
and for that he' s gonna cut you in on whatever he' s got going with king .
you got that ?
omar , you got it ?
flight' s booked to belize .
almost home .
got to get you home to pack .
get ready for your trip tomorrow .
can you picture me with a drink with the umbrella in it ?
little sunscreen on the nose .
hey , jake !
back off !
back off !
whoa , whoa !
take it easy !
jesus !
what , the tip not work out for you guys ?
tip worked out fine , we' re just a little curious about the fed .
hey look , you don' t pay your fucking taxes ...
get the fuck back !
back up !
special agent gunther butan .
that ring a bell ?
gunther ?
no , i think i would remember a gunther .
let me jog your memory a little .
jesus !
fuck !
gunther butan , you say ?
i think i might know this guy .
yeah , well he' s in town and he sure as shit remembers you .
what are we gonna do about this jake ?
we can' t afford having a fed onto us like this .
i wouldn' t dream of that .
fuck , man !
the way we look at it , jake , you have a limited window of opportunity here before he catches up to you .
but i got good news for you , okay ?
you got us .
we' re your white knights .
we' re gonna keep him off your back .
and we get a piece of whatever you got going down with the king .
and don' t argue with me ' cause i got a lot of pent up aggression .
say something stupid if we got a deal , jake .
something stupid .
don' t leave town , brother .
funny .
oh fuck .
have a nice day , officers .
how did we do ?
we did exactly like you said .
i have complete faith in you , lloyd .
why' s this guy so hard up for you ?
you' re not exactly a threat to national security .
we go way back .
a few years ago we were working in tampa for a local goon .
turns out this mutt was being watched by the feds , which now meant we were being watched by the feds ... one in particular ...
agent gunther butan .
we were just overseeing some creative importing , so he really didn' t have anything on us .
but i figured , maybe this guy' s good for a fix .
our guys in the lapd , give them $20 , they' il look the other way on a parking ticket .
maybe you' il get yourself a new tie with that .
but a fed ?
you get a guy like that as your fix ...
it was probably a stupid idea .
there i was armani and rolex .
there he is , jc penny and timex .
so i took a shot .
now he had me on attempted bribery of a federal agent .
so that' s how gunter butan and i became friends .
butan ... shit .
here .
so what ?
we just stay clear of him .
i don' t think so .
i think we gotta walk .
wait a minute .
we can handle this .
come on .
no .
not this time .
i say we walk .
wait .
take it easy for a second .
i' m not gonna take it easy .
' cause you don' t know this guy .
he' s gonna be all over us like white on rice .
there' s no shaking him and you know it .
so we change the scam a little .
there is no more fucking scam .
i got a sign on my back now .
i can' t leave town and then show up with a suitcase full of money .
it' s over .
the gig is up .
jake , jake .
the skirt' s got a point .
all you have to do is tweak it a bit .
it over .
that' s it .
you gotta know when to walk away .
and you guys are too careless with the money .
gordo with the cars .
you with the strippers .
they call themselves dancers .
they call themselves dancers , huh ?
what about big al ?
did that not fucking register with you ?
remember seeing him sitting there with a bullet hole in his head ?
that doesn' t mean anything ?
you' re being such a raving pussy .
i mean , pull yourself together , for christ' s sake .
who the fuck do you think you' re talking to ?
sweetheart , we fucked once , okay ?
that does not entitle you a voice in this room .
and don' t think i didn' t know you weren' t working some angle , either .
easy , jake .
that' s a lady .
everyone' s working an angle , right ?
there are three people i trust in this world , those two guys on the couch and a dead guy .
you , i don' t know you .
you' re like a stray dog that wandered into my house one day looking for a belly rub .
so why don' t you just go back to wherever it is you came from ?
you don' t have anybody looking for you .
not the king , not butan , not price .
so just cut loose of this .
it is over .
what about ...
what about what ?
what about the money ?
there it is .
that little itch you need to scratch .
always about the money .
what do you want ?
you want an apology ?
no .
i want my cut .
take a deep breath , count to 10 , and try and get it through your thick skull , there is no cut .
you' re an asshole .
so that' s it , huh ?
that' s it .
we' re closing up shop .
you guys know what to do , right ?
jesus christ , jake , i can' t believe you' re gonna just ...
miles .
so much for honor among thieves .
you were going to cut loose your friends , your girl ...
what the fuck are you talking about ?
i was doing it for them .
i was trying to protect them .
bullshit .
you weren' t doing it for them .
you were scared .
come on , admit it .
you lost your nerve and you lost your confidence .
you weren' t trying to be noble .
you weren' t trying to save anyone but your goddamn self .
admit it .
you got no idea what you' re talking about .
it' s not true .
it is fucking true .
they were right there for you !
she was right there for you .
look at her .
i fucking said look at her !
she trusted you , and you sold her out .
now i want you to look at her , and i want you to tell her .
be a fucking man .
you be honest .
you tell her .
you tell her that you loved her , but the fucking money meant more to you .
fucking grifters , man .
gentleman' s racket , my fucking ass .
just another low life scammer looking out for number one .
get the fuck up !
get the fuck up !
the king ain' t gonna like this .
he had a real thing with getting this price guy .
if you ask me , i think he' s jealous .
of what ?
they' re both crooks .
they actually grew up in the same neighborhood .
king talks about it all the time .
how come he' s always humping it out , while price gets to walk around in three piece suits , hobnob with movie stars , own a bank , that type of shit .
next to price , the king is still small time and he' s pissed off .
a point , lupus .
give us a point .
i don' t give a shit if he thinks he' s a pimple on price' s ass .
he wouldn' t piss on my face if my teeth were on fire .
that' s nice .
interesting imagery .
look at that .
the size of a cigar , right ?
you know why i got that ?
the king asked me for a four shot one day .
that' s four shots of espressos .
turns out we only have enough coffee for a three shot .
so i' m thinking , maybe i' m doing him a favor .
and before he even comes picks it up , he' s screaming at me like i just hit on his mother !
i assume this is going to lead to some kind of point .
this is what i get for bringing him the wrong fucking cup of coffee , imagine what he' s going to do to you .
i have to admit , he did have a point .
there was no way the king was going to let us slide .
yeah , so we were back on .
after you cut her loose ?
which was apparently my mistake .
how' d you know we' d still go through with it ?
i know you , jake .
and i know how to take care of myself .
morgan price , please .
yeah , i' d be interested in that .
why don' t you give me an address and i' il send over a car ?
and you and i can discuss the particulars of your proposal .
no .
i come to you and i only deal with you .
it was a smart play .
she handed me to you on a silver platter .
silver platter ?
motherfucker , let me tell you a story .
that' s an exciting story .
travis , anybody ever try something like this before ?
not that i can recall .
and how much did you say you wanted for this finder' s fee ?
10 % .
i studied under a nobel laureate of economics at cambridge and i think even she' d say 10 was high .
i don' t give a fuck if you studied at marice' s academy of wig design .
you' re lucky i' m even here .
10 is standard .
okay .
travis , see if you can get him to tell you how he did it .
or almost did it .
sounds like a good story .
oh , i' il get it .
come on , what happened today ?
today ?
today started off great .
ashby was going to call us with the exact time of the transfer .
the king was waiting on us .
just to be safe , gordo was boarding the plane instead of me .
i needed manzano and whitworth to keep butan off our backs .
so i had to stay in town and cut them in on the deal .
so they waited for my call while miles and i waited for ashby .
she should be landing right about now .
that customs guy is ready , right ?
i feel lucky today , miles .
real lucky .
found a penny , heads up .
and i got rid of the redhead .
yeah .
we got rid of the redhead .
jake ?
customs ?
they say a good chess player can see up to 20 moves deep .
that means in some games you' ve calculated every move in your head .
the game' s over , even before it' s really started .
like a game of chess , same with a con .
you have to see that deep .
yeah ?
ashby ,
it' s vig .
jake , yeah .
it' s going through ... right ... now .
good .
and with the push of a button , all the pieces were in play .
gordo ?
it' s all good .
do it .
first and goal .
hi there .
i' d like this cashed , please .
mr. ashby ?
mr. thompson from international calling .
he has a 34 r on a corporate account in belize .
that' s probably just a new account marker , i' il ...
to ensure we weren' t going to welch ,
ashby' s cut was transferred into his own offshore account .
tell you what .
i am going to lunch .
you tell him i' il call him back later .
we called them the green twinkies .
we got twinkies .
gordo , that' s outstanding .
good work .
lupus , we got the money .
i don' t believe this .
gordo' s flying back with it now .
so we' il head on over to the bar , meet up with everybody there .
i sent miles to the airport to wait for gordo to land .
everything was going as planned .
gordo ?
gordo , do me a favor .
just use the bathroom on the plane , all right ?
gordo ?
gordo !
guy' s walking around with $5 million cash and he' s going to stop to use a public bathroom at the airport ?
un fucking believable .
that guy' s got a serious problem .
you' re telling me .
here' s where i got stupid , here' s where i got that big fucking itch .
what ?
i got something on me ?
i' m going to be straight with you , lupus .
i don' t think we could' ve gotten this far without you .
so i got a little proposition for you .
a way for us to clear the whole five million .
now think about that , five million split four ways .
you want in ?
what do i have to do ?
all right .
yeah , it' s vig .
i' m gonna need an escort .
not a ride , just an escort .
ontario airport .
look for gordo .
he' s going to be carrying a black nike duffel bag .
you guys take care of butan ?
don' t worry .
we got him covered .
all right , good .
that was him .
there' s a shipment coming in this afternoon .
ontario airport .
we' re going to give mr. jake vig the surprise of a lifetime .
fbi agent rosen speaking .
artie .
butan .
yeah .
ontario airport this afternoon .
come heavy .
all we need you to do is call the king .
tell him it' s all good .
get the king off of our backs .
yeah , boss , it' s me , lupus .
you were right .
he' s trying to fuck you .
what ?
vig' s trying to fuck you .
police escorts are going to pick up the money .
i knew it , i knew it ...
i should have listened to my instinct .
shit !
how do we get the money now ?
you gonna have to take it in the airport .
the guy he' s got a black nike duffel bag on wheels .
he' s got this thing with bathrooms .
if he makes it through customs he' il be heading for the john .
that' s good .
we' il get him with his pants down .
you' il take care of scooter once we get the money .
maybe gordo' s got it right .
maybe we' re all just looking for a safe place to shit .
that' s cute .
very cute .
what about all that bullshit at the bar ?
about your three shot , four shot espresso sob story ?
showing me your little boo boo .
what was all that fucking shit ?
that ?
i got that at a barbecue , grilling halibut .
you trust this butan guy ?
i don' t trust anybody .
i' m so sick of listening to this douche bag' s shit .
i swear to fucking god .
if my kid' s teeth weren' t so fucked up ,
i' d love to walk up to that dude and take that gay hat of his and shove it right up his ass on principle .
you see how bad this guy wants vig ?
it' s like a sickness .
i say we collar him ourselves .
that way we got vig , we got leverage and we trade .
vig for the tape .
this is butan .
you guys awake ?
yeah , we' re here .
okay , stay sharp .
be right back .
is this it ?
this it , harlin ?
motherfucking no brains , this one has .
so lupus .
what do you do now ?
you go back to fetching coffee for the king ?
don' t worry about me .
stop trying to fuck with my head .
okay , i got him .
he' s heading towards the east exit .
do not under any circumstances apprehend .
i want you to follow him all the way down to vig' s .
roger that .
we got that jerkoff .
let' s go .
keep your pants on .
he just went into the crapper .
let' s say gordo doesn' t make it through customs .
you' re gonna be just as fucked as we are .
you think about that ?
not for nothing , jake , but the guy who whacked your buddy ?
it was me .
the king usually farms out for that kind of stuff , but he was so pissed off at you he couldn' t wait for the regular guy .
the fucker didn' t even put down the kung pao chicken .
oo ooh , shit !
come on .
stand up .
what ?
stand the fuck up !
jake , no offense , but i' ve seen you fight .
you gotta be kidding me .
okay , they pulled a switch .
black man , brown suit .
big .
hey , asshole .
keep ' em up nice and high .
what the ...
don' t fucking move .
freeze !
freeze !
freeze !
put your weapon down !
we' re lapd !
get down on your knees .
we' re fucking cops .
lapd , man .
look at this , come on .
on the curb !
face forward !
all the way down !
hands on your head .
hands outside where we can see them .
bring him out .
nice and easy .
turn around .
can i make a suggestion ?
take these cuffs home and use them on your wife .
you' il like it .
i like it tight , but not that tight .
how about you ?
let' s go .
oh .
look what we got here .
heroin .
two keys .
we' re good .
he' s good .
he' s good .
he who ?
you gotta like it .
officers manzano and whitworth ,
agent artie rosen ,
federal bureau of investigations .
how hard do you think it is to sell one dealer' s drugs to another ?
don' t fucking say anything !
yeah .
the king just got pinched with the bag .
okay .
what happened ?
he got caught .
what ?
fucking king just got us all pinched .
oh shit !
what do i do ?
what the fuck ...
lupus , just calm down .
lupus !
i never thanked you for that .
no problem .
can we all stop being so fucking polite and get to the point ?
that' s right , where' s the fucking money , jake ?
what do you get out of this ?
a fucking finder' s fee ?
it' s all about the money , isn' t it ?
fuck you .
you sold me out .
you sold me out huge .
you should have trusted me ,
like i trusted you .
you fucked up .
you fucked up huge .
all right , all right , now you turn the fuck around .
the only way you' re gonna live is if you get me my fucking money !
now where the fuck is it ?
i' m gonna ask you one more time before your brains hit the ground .
where is my money ?
probably in the hands of the federal government .
you know jake , you ... you really fucking disappoint me , jake .
you just let lily down here again , too .
what was that you were saying about playing the big con , it' s like putting on a big play , and everybody knows their part ?
i guess some people forgot their fucking lines .
yeah , i guess so .
you guess so ?
so why don' t you just take a deep breath , jake , and i' m gonna count to 10 .
one , two ... three , four , five ...
i do trust you , lily .
six , seven ...
oh , shit !
what the ...
trust ...
did you kill him ?
should be a four letter word .
i don' t know .
don' t do that shit while i' m standing right here !
you get the fuck away from me .
get the fuck out of here !
now !
so i' m dead .
but can i really blame lily ?
should i just have trusted her ?
who knows ?
sooner or later , someone' s gonna start asking the right questions .
the feds would want to know why were they sent in to just bust a couple of crooked cops .
manzano and whitworth would ask how the drugs got into that duffel bag .
the king and price would ask , where their money really went .
and everyone would ask , what agency was it that
special agent gunther butan really worked for ?
you need a ride ?
hey .
how' d it go ?
smooth .
the guys we have in the lapd , give them $20 and they' il look the other way on a parking ticket .
maybe you' il get yourself a new tie with that ?
but a fed , you get a guy like that as your fix ...
so what do you got going next ?
so that' s how gunther butan and i became friends .
look at you .
you' re still working that crazy tie routine .
i' m partial to it .
you take your cut ?
yeah , i' m good .
well , where you off to next ?
wherever it is , don' t stay too long , you know ?
stay loose .
always .
i' d keep the girl .
sooner or later , all the right questions would get answered .
because playing the big con ...
what' s this ?
is like putting on a play .
a play where everyone knows their part , except the mark .
sometimes , jake , style can get you killed .
and like in a game of chess , you' ve played every move in your head .
yeah , boss .
it' s me , lupus .
you were right .
he' s trying to fuck you .
you' re a good grifter , man .
it' s hard to tell when you' re lying .
it' s hard .
but what do i care ?
i' m dead .
nobody' s gonna be asking me .
i think you dropped that , baby .
miles , would you be so kind ?
absolutely .
