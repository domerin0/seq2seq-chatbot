somebody once wrote , " hell is the impossibility of reason .
that' s what this place feels like , hell .
i hate it already , and it' s only been a week .
some goddamn week , grandma .
boy , dig , dig !
the hardest thing i think i' ve ever done' s go on point , 3 times this week .
i don' t even know what i' m doing .
a gook could be standing 3 feet in front of me and i wouldn' t know it .
i' m so tired .
we get up at 5 : 00a . m . , hump all day .
camp around 4 : 00 or 5 : 00 , dig a foxhole , eat , and put out an all night ambush or 3 man listening post in the jungle .
it' s scary , ' cause nobody tells me how to do anything ' cause i' m new .
nobody cares about the new guys .
they don' t even want to know your name .
the unwritten rule is a new guy' s life isn' t worth as much ...
' cause he hasn' t put his time in yet , and they say if you' re gonna get killed in the ' nam , it' s better to get it in the first few weeks , the logic being you don' t suffer that much .
if you' re luck , you stay in the perimeter at night , and then you pull a 3 hour guard shift .
so maybe you sleep 3 , 4 hours a night , but you don' t really sleep .
i don' t think i can keep this up for a year , grandma .
i think i made a big mistake coming here .
we got beaucoup movement .
3o .
battalion just got hit 15 clicks north of here .
charlie had claymores strung up in the trees .
blew a whole fuckin ' platoon to pieces .
bad shit .
yeah .
they got 2 lieutenants and a captain .
jesus .
all right , sergeant , who do you want on ambush ?
elias , you take your squad out .
warren , you stay in , but i' il need tex and junior from your squad .
roger that .
okay , move out in 2 0 mikes .
i thought it was o' neill' s turn tonight .
no , no , no .
tubbs and morehouse are short .
fu shen is going on r & r tomorrow , and you wanna send them out on an ambush ?
uh uh .
you got the fresh meat , buddy .
they don' t know shit , barnes and chance are we' re gonna run into something .
think about it .
what do you want me to do ?
send 1 of my guys out to get zapped so some lame ass can get his beauty sleep ?
nah .
hey , o' neill , take a break .
you don' t take to be a prick every day of your life .
elias , get your men ready .

o' neill , your short timers stay in , but you go out .

it' s gonna piss on us all night .
gonna put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours , junior .
goddamn , man .
you break your ass for the white man .
no justice around here .
what' s o' neill got , a nose up the lieutenant' s ass already ?
how come we always get fuckin ' ambush ?
' cause it' s politics , man .

lucy jean .
she' s waitin ' for me too .

oh , susanna don' t you cry for me for i come from alabama with my banjo ...
' course , mom and dad didn' t want me to come here .
they wanted me to be just like them ... respectable , hard working , a little house , a family .
they drove me crazy with their goddamn world , grandma .
you know mom .
i guess i' ve always been sheltered and special .
i just want to be anonymous , like everybody else ... do my share for my country .

pork bend , utah , wampum , pennsylvania .
2 year' s high school is about it .
maybe , if their lucky , a job waitin ' for ' em back in a factory , but most of ' em got nothing .
they' re poor , they' re the unwanted , yet they' re fightin ' for our society and our freedom .
it' s weird , isn' t it ?
they' re the bottom of the barrel , and they know it .
maybe that' s why they call themselves " grunts " ,
' cause a grunt can take it , can take anything .
they' re the best i' ve ever seen , grandma , the heart and soul .
hey , taylor , hey .

you hear me ?
okay .
maybe i finally found it way down here in the mud .
maybe from down here i can startup again , be somethin ' i can be proud of without havin ' to fake it , be a fake human being .
maybe i can see somethin ' i don' t yet see , or learn somethin ' yet know .

staff sergeant barnes .
sir .

you got it , dai wee , and i can throw in plenty of eyewitnesses if you want , sir .
not now , goddamn it .

we' il get into this when we get back to the base camp .
and i can promise you something .
if i find out there was an illegal killing , there will be a court martial .
right now i need every man in the field .
and you two will cease fire .
staff sergeant barnes ,
sergeant elias , you hear me ?

look .
you bloods are gettin ' too hung up on all this shit .
these gooks are a lot smarter than you think .
you know , barnes knows his shit , man .
they was n. v. a. , every last one of them .
now he' s taken us this far , right ?
he' il take us the rest of the way .
i don' t know , homes .
i mean , a christian don' t go around a village cutting off heads and shit .
shit is really getting out of hand , man .
it' s blowin ' way out of control .
it seems to me that you don' t seem to know the difference ... the way you shoot up that shit all the time .
i don' t know , brothers , but i' m hurting real bad inside .
don' t worry about it , sergeant .
elias won' t be able to prove a thing .
i mean , he' s a troublemaker , he ...
elias is a water walker .
like them politicians in washington trying to fight this war ... with one hand tied around their balls .
ain' t no need or time for a courtroom out here .
sarge .
thanks , bun .
how' d it go there , bob ?
yeah .
that away , sarge .
fucking elias , man .
he' s a fucking rat , that' s what he is .
he' s gonna get everybody in this platoon in deep shit .
somebody ought to frag his ass .
so what do you think there , bob ?
gonna be an investigation or what ?
bob ?
o' neill , man , you worry too much .
sarge will take care of it .
it' s a beautiful night .
yeah , i love this place at night ...
the stars .
there' s no right or wrong in them .
they' re just there .
that' s a nice way of putting it .
barnes has got it in for you , doesn' t he ?
barnes believes in what he' s doing .
and you ?
do you believe ?
in ' 65 , yeah .
now ,
no .
what happened today is just the beginning .
we' re gonna lose this war .
come on .
you really think so ?
honest ?
we' ve been kicking other people' s asses for so long ...
i figure it' s time we got ours kicked .
day by day ,
i struggle to maintain not only my strength ... but my sanity .
it' s all a blur .
i' ve no energy to write .
i don' t know what' s right and what' s wrong anymore .
the morale of the men is low ...
a civil war in the platoon , half the men with elias , half with barnes .
there' s a lot of suspicion and hate .
i can' t believe we' re fighting each other ... when we should be fighting them .
counting days and the six inches in front of my face , not much else .
hope things are well , grandma .
tell mom and dad i ... well , just tell them .
chris .

o' neill' s .
bunny' s ?
wolfe' s ?
bullshit !
you try that , and barnes will shove it right back up your ass ...
with a candle on it .
then what do you suggest we do ?
i suggest , you all watch your own asses .
' cause barnes is gonna be comin ' down on all of them .
you just gonna forget about elias ... and all the good times we done had right in here ?
shit , you' re trying to cure the headache by cutting off his head .
elias didn' t ask you to fight his battles for him .
and if there' s a heaven ... and god i hope there is ...
i know he' s sitting up there drunk as fuckin ' monkey and smokin ' shit .
' cause he done left his pains down here .
you' re wrong , man .
any way you cut it , barnes is a fuckin ' murderer !
taylor ,
i remember when you first came in here , tellin ' me how much you admired the bastard .
i was wrong .
wrong ?
you ain' t never been right about nothin ' !
dig this , you assholes , and dig it good .
barnes has been shot 7 times , and he ain' t dead .
does that mean anything to you ?
huh ?
barnes ain' t meant to die .
the only thing that could kill barnes ... is barnes .
you talking about killing ?
y ' all experts ?
y ' all know about killing ?
i' d like to hear about it , potheads .
are you smoking this shit so' s to escape from reality ?
me , i don' t need this shit .
i am reality .
there' s the way it ought to be .
and there' s the way it is .
elias was full of shit .
elias was a crusader .
now , i got no fight ... with any man who does what he' s told . but when he don' t , the machine breaks down .
and when the machine break down , we break down .
and i ain' t gonna allow that ... in any of you .
not one .
y ' all love elias .
oh , you wanna kick ass .
yeah .
well , here i am , all by my lonesome .
and there ain' t nobody gonna know .
6 of you boys against me .
kill me .
i shit on all of you .

10 years .
you' il climb the fuckin ' walls , man .
don' t do it .
death ?
what do you all know about death ?
they sent us back into the valley the next day , about 2 . 000 m . from cambodia , into a battalion perimeter .
it felt like we were returnin ' to the scene of a crime .
alpha company had been hit hard the day before by a sizeable force , and charlie company hadbeen probed that night .
there were other battalions in the valley ... we weren' t the only one ... but we knew we were going to be the bait to lure them out .
somewhere out there was the entire 141st n. v. a. regiment .
caught those motherfuckers trying to pull some shit on ...
charlie company last night .
they found maps on them , man .
got a friend at battalion .
says they had every fuckin ' fox hole here fixed on .
distances , tree lines , our claymores , everything .
this is bad man .
i got bad vibes here .
i also heard we' re in fuckin ' cambodia right now .
cambodia ?
man , you' re kidding me .
you wanted to see me , sir ?
yeah , ramucci .
looks like you got elias' s squad now .
squad , sir ?
i didn' t know we were still referrin ' to this platoon in terms of squads .
all right .
look .
i want you to take those two holes .
right there and there .
you' re tyin ' it off with barnes up here , king down there .
yeah .
begging your pardon , sir , my 2 holes are far enough apart ... you can run a regiment through them and never see it .
i got 5 live bodies left , sir .
look , i don' t want to hear you problems , ramucci .
you' il get new men any day .
meantime , you make do like everybody else .
i didn' t ask for this job .
i don' t want to hear it .
oh , you don' t want to hear it .
yeah , that' s right .
i don' t want to hear it , ' cause to tell you ... the truth , i don' t give a shit , okay ?
i just don' t give a flying fuck anymore .

i' m glad i ain' t going with them .
somewhere out there is the beast , and he hungry tonight .

girl ?
you got a mother and father , don' t you ?
there must be somebody .
nah , there' s nobody .
you' ve been smoking too much of this shit , troop .
gotta control that .
bring a man down .
i remember when you first come out here to the bush .
you were as green as a ...
did you ever get caught in a mistake that you just can' t get out of , king ?
there' s a way out of anything , man .
just keep you pecker hard and your powder dry , and the worm will turn .
how many days you short ?
nah , it' s not just me .
it' s the way the whole thing works .
people like elias get wasted .
people like barnes just go on makin ' up the rules any way they want .
so what do we do ?
sit in the middle and suck on it .
we just don' t add up to dry shit .
whoever said we did , man ?
all you got to do is make it out of here , and it' s all gravy . every day , the rest of your life ... gravy .
oh , shit .
super lifer .
hey king , collect up your shit .
your orders just come through .
oh , look , man .

sergeant o' neill .
how are you doing ?
i' m just fine , sir .
well , that' s good ' cause you got second platoon .
yes , sir .
you ready ?
you bet .
i think now , looking back , we did not fight the enemy .
we fought ourselves , and the enemy was in us .
the war is over form e now , but i' il always be there ... the rest of my days , as i' m sure elias' il be , fightin ' with barnes for what rhah called possession of my soul .
there' re times since ...
i' ve felt like the child ... born of those two fathers .
but be that as it may , those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again , to teach to others what we know , and to try with what' s left of our lives ... to find a goodness and meaning ... to this life .
