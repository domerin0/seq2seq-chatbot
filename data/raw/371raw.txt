decrease the vertical trajectory if you have to .
a le rhne rotary won' t stall at 60 degrees .
we' re still short two cameras .

jesus christ , sonny .
howard .
howard .
let me give you a little advice , huh ?
take your oil money ...
drill bits .
all right , take your drill bit money and put it in the bank .
if you continue making the movie the way you are ... ... there isn' t gonna be a distributor ... ... you won' t find anybody who wants to see the movie ... ... and you' re not gonna have any more oil money .
so welcome to hollywood .
yeah .
well , i' il be sure to remember that , mr. mayer .
good luck .
all right .
he needs 26 to make it work ?
he' s out of his mind .
i looked down at my pants .
it was a strange situation .
boss .
scram , love boat , let' s go .
another soda .
you know what i mean .
milk .
in the bottle .
with the cap still on .
okay , what did his highness say ?
son of a bitch won' t part with a single goddamn camera .
why don' t you try and make do with what you have .
what i have isn' t enough , john , not for how i see it .
look .
my name depends on this picture .
if it doesn' t work , i' m back to houston ... ... making goddamn drill bits for the rest of my life .
can' t you do it with the cameras you have ?
you ought to hear about what' s going on with demille .
he' s shooting his bible picture .
he' s gotta do a crucifixion in fresno .
johnny .
a bunch of tractors ...
johnny .
you' re a press agent , are you not ?
yeah .
you' re supposed to know the ins and outs ?
absolutely .

margaret .
margaret .

thelma , this is howard hughes .
howard and i were discussing how he wants me to pull a camera out of my ass .
cigarette ?
oh , no , thanks .

my god .
would you do me a favor and just ... ?
would you just smile for me one time ?
just once ?
yeah .
yeah .

just like this .
with my fingertips .

i need two more cameras by saturday .
rent them if you can .
steal them if you have to .
absotively , boss .
absotively .
rumors coming from a lonely airstrip out in van nuys .
sources whisper that young texas industrialist howard hughes ... ... won' t stop pouring money into his war epic .
and do we mean epic !
one hundred and thirty seven pilots , 87 airplanes ... ... 35 cameramen , 2000 extras .
how long will it be before this picture ... ... ends up costing as much as the real war ?
damn it .
why the hell do they look so slow ?
this isn' t what it was like up there .
they look like goddamn models !
son of a bitch .
howard ?
without something standing still behind the planes ... ... we' ve got no idea of how fast we' re moving .
we got no sense of relative motion .
call ucla .
get me the best meteorologist they got .
you get him here in an hour , all right ?
hey .
you want the good news or the bad news ?
bad news , always .
all right .
we installed the 450 radial .
struts won' t take the vibration .
minute we fire her up , the struts start cracking at the attach points .
well , what' s the good news ?
there isn' t any .
goddamn it , odie .
if the 450' s too big , we figure something else out .
we' ve done everything .
we' ve rebuilt her from top to toe .
if we drain the fuel tank ... ... she might make 180 miles per hour .
i want minimum 200 , all right ?
i want a date with theda bara .
that ain' t gonna happen .
oh , don' t be so sure .
if the struts won' t sustain the engine we need , we gotta get rid of the struts .
no , then the top wing falls off .
then let it .
what ?
who says we need a top wing ?
i mean , who says we need anything ?
a monoplane .
a cantilevered monoplane , right ?
they' re doing it in france .
to hell with the top wing and struts .
a 550 wasp engine .
one hundred octane fuel .
that would give us a horsepower of what ?
seven hundred .
we squeeze that to a thousand , we got the fastest plane ever built .
you know , i' ve gotta say ... ... we' ve already spent over $200, 000 rebuilding this plane .
to hell with it .
tear it up , odie .
go on .
well ...
the cumulonimbus formations about which you speak ... ... that look like ...
giant breasts full of milk .
i want clouds , damn it .
yes , clouds ... ... that look like giant breasts full of milk ... ... cannot exactly be guaranteed for any particular occasion .
so you might have to ...
to wait .
then we' il wait .
look , whatever they pay you at ucla ... ... i' m doubling it , all right ?
you work for me now .
find some clouds .
find some clouds .
find me some clouds !
welcome to hell' s angels .
thank you .
i' ve been to chatsworth , santa cruz , encino , san diego ... ... riverside , van nuys and bakersfield .
it has been eight months !
where are my goddamn clouds , huh ?
they move , mr. hughes !
clouds move .
that' s what they do .
they move !
you see that ?
it is costing me $5271 a day ... ... to keep those planes on the ground .
you find me some goddamn clouds , huh ?
nice day .
yeah , very funny .
i got a call from houston .
they' re getting nervous .
stop showing them the damn bills .
that would be illegal .
shit , no .
maybe it' s a little bit naughty .
hughes tool is incorporated in texas .
they have to see the bills .
incorporate a new division out here .
we' il call it hughes aircraft .
do we need these rivets on the cowling ?
yeah , or the reverse thrust would rip it off .
they' re gonna give me drag .
do something about that .
wind resistance on rivets ?
i want her slippery .
there are tax consequences to incorporating in california .
just take care of it , would you ?
mr. hughes !
oakland !
we have clouds in oakland !
you mean it this time ?
yes !
goddamn it , yes .
i can promise you .
clouds in oakland .
all right , don' t get all jittery now .
oakland !
oakland !
we' re going to oakland !
oakland .
down and to the left !
that' s perfect !
that' s right , senator george .
yes , young howard hughes has pulled it off !
after two years , hell' s angels has finally finished filming .
there' s gonna be one heck of a wrap party in hollywood tonight .
the price tag ?
a staggering $ 2 million .
if every human being in america buys a ticket ... ... he might even make a profit .
first , clouds don' t come .
then planes break down .
then the planes crash .
we' ve had everything but a plague of locusts on this thing .
i mean , you have to admit .
now , honestly , did you ever think you' d actually finish the damn thing ?
come with me .
mama , darling , if i' m a success in this show ...
... we' re gonna move from here .
oh , no .
yes .
we' re gonna move up in the bronx .
green grass , a lot of people you know .
the ginsbergs , the guttenbergs and the goldbergs .
oh , a whole lot of " bergs .
i don' t know them all .
see , this is what the people want .
silent pictures are yesterday' s news .
so i figure we gotta reshoot hell' s angels for sound .
how much of it ?
all of it .
before you ask , i' il tell you .
an additional 1 . 7 million .
we got that much ?
no !
well , we' il make it .
take care of that , would you ?
now , get this .
in the halls of 7000 romaine ... ... it goes on day after day , month after month .
howard hughes is now editing some 25 miles of film .
heck , i say release it now and give the world its first 560 hour movie .
pat , mr. hughes needs this reel in the projection room right now !
enough is enough , mr. hughes .
are you ever gonna let us actually see this epic of yours ?
hurry up !
who is it ?
noah .
come on in .
i' ve been on the phone to houston for three hours .
we' re fixing every goddamn book we have .
wait , wait .
yeah .
run reel 10 again .
i think we' re duplicating a shot here .
and tell jimmy i want 10 chocolate chip cookies , all right ?
medium chips , none too close to the outside .
got it ?
you remember that goddamn shot from reel 10 ?
no .
i don' t remember anything from reel 10 .
i don' t know what reel 10 is .
i' m a businessman , howard .
and so are you .
now , look .
this has been a great ride .
we' ve had a hell of a lot of fun .
but you' re losing $25, 000 a day doing this .
every day .
so , what are my options ?
well , this time i don' t know that you have any .
i' m afraid you gotta close it down .
dig your way out .
i' m sorry , howard .
i truly am .
reel 10 , mr. hughes .
mortgage tool co .
every asset .
you heard me .
lf you do that , you could lose everything .
well , i won' t .
i won' t .
all right .
i' il get into it .
thanks , noah .
more than half a million souls lining the curb of hollywood boulevard .
look at the automobiles !
there are 45, 000 cars here , making it the greatest traffic jam ever seen .
howard hughes must have a lump in his throat .
six months after the stock market crashes and after three pilots ' deaths ... ... he' s finally unveiling his $4 million baby doll .
it' s the most expensive movie ever made .
nothing five and dime for our mr. hughes .
nothing like tonight has ever been seen before , and i can say ... ... it will never be seen again .
five hundred thousand people are crowding the streets to get a glimpse of the stars .
three companies of marines were called to assist ... ... the 250 special police who are handling this enormous crowd ...
this is an industry town .
and nobody but nobody makes a movie outside a studio .
some hollywood insiders over at the brown derby may be laughing ...
and now , i think ...
yes , yes , i can see mr. hughes ' car arriving now .
mr. hughes escorts the lovely starlet jean harlow .
he discovered her for this picture , and we think her platinum blond locks ... ... and hot jazz , baby doll style are gonna make her a big star .
howard !
howard !
over here !
this way , boss .
right over there .
mr. hughes , how about a word ?
big night for you , mr. hughes .
big night for you tonight .
very big .
very big .
tell us what it was like making this fabulous picture .
yes .
yeah .
so 4 million clams from your own pocket .
nervous how the flick will fly ?
big night .
you enjoy the show .
yes , well , let me present the feminine star of this spectacle , hell' s angels ... ... miss jean harlow .
thank you .
i would like to use this occasion to thank mr. hughes ... ... for the opportunity he gave me .
thank you .
thank you !
now i' d like to ask roscoe arbuckle ... ... to introduce his pet lion cub , gilmore .
what' s the matter with you ?
can' t remember my name ?
i' m sorry .
roscoe turner , and this would be gilmore .
it' s going !
it' s going !
murder !
that' s what this dirty , rotten politician war is , murder !
you know it as well as i do .
stand up , slim , take a bow .
reel four played too long .
too many coughs .
get the team out of the party and to the office .
i wanna cut a few shots .
oh , find glenn .
somebody write this down .
flush rivets .
got that ?
flush rivets .
flush rivets .
lickety split , boss .
here he is !
here he is !
variety says , " this one won' t miss !
magnificently photographed !
awesome beyond description !
the most extraordinary output to emerge from a motion picture studio .
not for a long time have i seen anything as enthralling .
it costs 4 million dollars and has 4 million thrills !
majestically ...
most epic picture of its time !
a lighter shade .
i don' t want to look like boris karloff .
if you know what i mean .
i read in the magazines that you play golf .
on occasion .
well , how about nine holes ?
now , mr. hughes ?
if it would be convenient , miss hepburn .
you' re not extending enough on your follow through .
follow through is everything in golf , just like life .
don' t you find ?
saw your scarface picture .
violent .
realistic .
movies are movies , howard .
not life .
now the stage .
the stage is real .
real flesh and blood .
human beings right out there in front of you , buster .
can' t look away .
can' t munch popcorn .
that would be rude .
do you like the theater ?
no .
oh , i adore the theater .
only alive on stage .
i' il teach you .
we' il see some ibsen .
if the republicans haven' t outlawed him by now .
you' re not a republican , are you ?
how did you vote in ' 32 ?
well , i didn' t .
you must !
it' s your sacred franchise .
heard you were wooing ginger rogers .
what about that ?
she' s just a friend .
men can' t be friends with women .
they must possess them or leave them be .
it' s a primitive urge from caveman days .
it' s all in darwin .
hunt the flesh , kill the flesh , eat the flesh .
that' s the male sex all over .
excuse me ?
well , if you' re deaf , you must own up to it .
get a hearing aid .
or see my father .
he' s a urologist , but it' s all tied up inside the body , don' t you find ?
me , i keep healthy .
i take seven showers a day to keep clean .
also because i am what' s so vulgarly referred to as " outdoorsy .
i' m not outdoorsy .
i' m athletic .
i sweat .
there it is .
now we both know the sordid truth .
i sweat and you' re deaf .
aren' t we a fine pair of misfits ?
three .
noble effort .
so i suppose you' re wooing me now ?
oh , well .
not enough .
not enough .
these rivets have to be completely flush .
i want every screw and joint countersunk .
i want no wind resistance on the fuselage .
she has got to be clean , odie .
clean .
understand ?
okay , howard .
i don' t know what else to tell you .
what do you got for me ?
the thing is , twa needs a new plane .
a modern plane .
oh , yeah ?
what kind of plane ?
okay .
the dc 3 has 21 daytime seats ... ... and 14 overnight berths .
something bigger ?
try 50 seats with a ceiling of 12, 000 feet .
no .
no , 20, 000 .
think about it .
what does 20, 000 feet give you ?
less turbulence .
because it' s above the weather .
jack , we wanna fly above the weather .
only 1 percent of the american population has set foot on an airliner .
why ?
because they' re scared to death .
they should be .
i mean , 7000 feet is bumpy as shit .
you know that .
we build a plane that flies above the weather ... ... we could get every man , woman and child in this country to feel safe .
an airplane with the ability to fly into the substratosphere across the country .
across the world .
now that is the future .
you with me ?
yeah .
i don' t wanna get into this if your board doesn' t have the balls for it .
would they support us ?
i don' t know .
what' s your financial picture ?
not great .
last year' s deficit ?
770, 000 .
what' s it selling at ?
about 8 dollars a share .
that' s the lowest it' s been , huh ?
i could do that .
do what ?
buy it .
you wanna buy the airline ?
for crying out loud ... ... we don' t want pencil pushers getting in the way of us making our plane .
give me brass tacks , now .
what does controlling interest in twa cost me ?
call it 15 million .
that is a chunk of change , huh ?
you call noah dietrich .
you have him start buying .
howard , hold on .
are you sure ?
you wanna think about it for five minutes ?
hell , jack , i got a tiger by the tail here .
i ain' t gonna let it go .
good evening , mr. hughes .
welcome .
your table is ready .
how goes the aviation ?
oh , just fine , pete .
i' m so glad .
good evening , mr. hughes .
madame .
it' s " miss .
miss .
the usual , mr. hughes ?
please .
may i recommend for the lady ... ... our clementine soup followed by roast duck with currant glaze ... ... and poached pears in rose sauce .
it' s truly divine .
yeah .
that sounds fine .
your kind of joint , is it ?
wouldn' t have thought .
they' re open late .
i go to a hot dog stand on la cienega too .
they' re open till about 4 .
are they ?
how marvelous .
howard !
howard !
hi !
son of a gun .
kate , this is johnny meyer .
i suppose you could call him my press agent .
pleased to meet you .
loved alice adams .
you' re too kind .
i' m sure you know errol , right ?
mr. flynn .
yes .
kate .
kate .
kate of the clenched jawed hepburns .
enchanting as always .
you should use lux on your hands , by the way .
i do .
you and howard ought to cook up a picture .
costar with errol .
i could sell that in spades .
that would be marvelous .
howard ?
i think not .
don' t you read variety , mr. meyer ?
well , i' m box office poison .
i' m on the outs , the skids , the doldrums .
washed up , day old fish not worth the eating , so they tell me .
hell with them .
hell with them , my dear .
soulless pricks to a man , right ?
johnny tells me you' re thinking about doing a western , of all goddamn things .
are you making a western , howard ?
yeah .
making a western .
i' m gonna call it the outlaw .
yeah .
and you know what it' s about ?
s e x.
it' s all about s e x.
it' s a western .
you can' t have fornication in a western .
it isn' t done .
it' s not real sex , it' s movie sex .
what scarface did for the gangster picture , the outlaw will do for the western .
put the sex and guts and blood up there on the screen .
have you seen my cigarettes ?
don' t mind us .
new york cut steak , 12 peas , bottle of milk with the cap on .
you can' t afford your own cigarettes ?
jack has all my money .
i hope your food isn' t getting cold at your table somewhere or something .
no , no .
we' re here all night .
don' t worry .
now , howard .
now , howard .
if you' re seriously talking about putting carnality ... ... back on the silver screen , you must swear to let me in on the casting session .
i have an eye for talent .
isn' t that right ?
you ought to give up prancing in tights ... ... be a talent scout .
that prancing paid for my new yacht .
you must all come sailing with me .
catalina .
what do you say ?
catalina .
sounds grand .
yeah .
i' ve even managed to coax ... ... the luscious miss de havilland and her equally luscious sister to come .
though i fear their mother will insist on coming , to preserve their questionable virtue .
we shall assault these twin monuments of pristine britannic beauty nonetheless .
what do you say , howard ?
yeah ?
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ?
i gotta go .
if you' il excuse us , we have ...
we have to be somewhere .
you are somewhere , howard , you madman .
somewhere else .
excuse us .
charmed , gentlemen .
do help yourself to the poached pears .
i hear they' re divine .
well .
howard hughes , ladies and gentlemen .
was that meant for me ?
my hero .
god , all that hollywood talk bores me silly .
as if there aren' t more important things , like mussolini .
where are we going , by the way ?
do you feel like a little adventure ?
do your worst , mr. hughes .
think you own this place , you limey bastard ?
i' m a tasmanian bastard , you prick .
thataway , errol .
let me at him !
that' s mr. mayer' s house right there .
do you know where jack warner lives ?
what' s that on the steering wheel ?
cellophane .
if you had any idea of the crap that people carry around on their hands .
what kind of crap ?
you don' t wanna know .
hold on to the wheel for a bit .
that' s too hard .
relax your hand .
relax your hand .
you see , you gotta feel the vibration of the engine through your fingertips .
do you feel that ?
yes .
well , that' s good .
golly !
well , she' s all yours .
where are you going ? !
i think there' s some milk back here .
you just keep us steady , now .
all right .
howard .
yeah ?
there' s a rather alarming mountain heading our way .
pull back on the wheel a smidge .
go on .
golly !
i don' t think i' ve ever met someone who actually uses the word " golly .
you all right ?
do you want me to take over ?
just when i' m getting the hang of it ?
you want some milk ?
oh , please .
utterly smashing !
we' il do it again .
i' m free wednesday .
it' s a little early for golf , though .
oh , no , no .
i live right there .
feel like a drink ?
lead on .
now , that makes for a challenging par four .
my decorator picked out the wallpaper and such .
he' s queer as a bedbug .
but i just hate this room .
gives me the willies .
like i' m about to be swallowed up by the latest issue of town & country .
what room do you like ?
my study .
take me there .
you are the tallest woman i know .
and all sharp elbows and knees .
beware .
will you fly me to work tomorrow ?
it is tomorrow .
keep your eye on the fuel .
she' s got a minimum to keep her weight down .
two runs .
that' s it .
after that , you' re flying on vapors .
and then you crash and you die .
give her easy flying .
don' t worry about speed and don' t think about the record today .
i wish you' d let someone else take her .
you' ve got 20 test pilots .
hell , why should i let someone else have all the fun ?
see you in a bit .
contact !
339 .
goddamn !
347 .
son of a bitch !
352 .
352 !
good girl .
damn it !
goddamn it !
oh , god !
there goes our meal ticket .

howard !
howard !

352 on the last run .
she' il go faster .
country mouse !
kate !
katie !
upstairs , city mouse .
hello .
good lord , what happened to you ?
oh , nothing .
a hard landing .
i cut my foot .
sit down .
i' il take care of it .
you tell me everything .
you cannot imagine what it was like , katie .
you cannot imagine the speed .
she was like a winged bullet up there .
what did she make ?
oh , around 352 .
you did it !
fastest man on the planet .
hot dog !
i' m so proud of you .
she did it , baby .
you knew she would .
oh , she was fine .
she was just fine .
now let me see your foot .
yeah .
good god !
you' re covered in blood .
oh , no .
that' s just beet juice .
i crashed into a beet field .
what ?
yeah , i crashed in a beet field .
let me get you cleaned up .
heavens , what is this ?
electrical tape ?
yeah .
odie just sort of slammed it on there .
but all i could think about was getting home to see you .
i am so proud of you .
now , this is gonna sting a little bit .
oh , this is useless .
come to the bathroom .
don' t get beet juice on the carpet .
i won' t , i won' t .
too hot !
don' t be a baby .
was the press there ?
some .
but they' re calling everyone .
should be on the wires by now .
what is it ?
kate ?
i' ve been famous , for better or worse ... ... for a long time now ... ... and i wonder if you know what it ... ... really means .
yeah .
i had my fair share of press on hell' s angels .
i' m used to it .
are you ?
howard , we' re ...
we' re not like everyone else .
too many acute angles .
too many eccentricities .
we have to be very careful not to ... ... let people in , or they' il make us into freaks .
kate , they can' t get in here .
we' re safe .
they can always get in .
when my brother killed himself ... ... there were photographers at the funeral .
there' s no decency to it .
you know , sometimes i ...
i get these feelings , katie .
i get these ideas , these ... ... crazy ideas about ... ... things that may not ...
things that may not really be there .
yeah .
sometimes i truly fear that i' m ... ... iosing my mind .
and if i did , it would ...
it' d be like flying blind .
you understand ?
you taught me to fly , howard .
i' il take the wheel .
smashing all records , howard hughes outdoes jules verne' s wildest dreams .
around the world from new york to new york in four days .
even beating wiley post' s mark by over three days .
new aviation history is written when his lockheed monoplane ... ... returns swiftly and safely .
a daring aviator .
a true pioneer of the world' s airways .
from new york to paris , he cuts lindbergh' s time in half .
then on to moscow .
thirty five hours out of new york , he roars across siberia' s trackless wastes .
sixty hours out of new york , he heads for alaska , most hazardous hop of all .
continuing the terrific pace , he comes home ... ... bringing new laurels to american aviation .
howard hughes and his crew may find more worlds to conquer ...
you won' t believe this .
it just came over the wires .
hughes has bought control of twa .
i thought mr. hughes was flying around the world .
apparently he did it while he was flying , over the radio .
i have heard some disquieting rumors about mr. hughes .
i' d like to know everything there is to know about mr. hughes .
i' d like you to attend to that for me .
thoroughly .
the pantages is glittering tonight .
howard !
right over here .
this way , over to the left .
mr. hughes , how was your flight ?
miss hepburn !
when are you gonna name the day ?
raise your head .
what' s the next movie ?
give us the scoop .
right here .
how many more records are you gonna set ?
right over here .
come on .
give us a smile .
it won' t kill you .
howard , this way .
beautiful .
over here , over here , mr. hughes .
when are you gonna fly around the world again ?
you gonna fly with kate next time ?
did you get ionely without her ?
talk to lindbergh about your flight yet ?
where' s linda darnell tonight ?
please , mr. hughes .
right here .
right here , mr. hughes .
are you trying to be more famous than lindbergh ?
you know , fame is supposed to be my turf .
l. b. !
if you don' t get more distinguished every time i see you .
you look so beautiful .
is that true ?
don' t worry about it , howard .
she' s just working the room .
it' s her job , baby .
sultry southern tigress ava gardner dazzles the room tonight .
she' s the newest star in the mgm galaxy .
and believe you me , she puts the " cheese " in " cheesecake .
well , jane eyre has been selling popcorn for over a hundred years , l. b.
hello .
hello .
could you reach me a towel ?
i ...
i really can' t do that .
i' m sorry .
i' m an idiot .
i' m a complete idiot , and i' m sorry .
forget it .
no , no .
i' m a vain , preening ass ... ... without a single redeeming feature .
that' s not true .
you have very good teeth .
come on .
i' ve got a better idea .
take me flying .
or better yet , i' il take you flying .
do your worst , miss hepburn .
don' t be so squirmy .
you' re gonna get on famously with father and mother .
and i' m sure they' il like you too .
once they get to know you .
hello !
hello !
kath , hello .
kathy .
who' s that with the camera right there ?
that' s my ex husband , ludlow .
father and mother are just mad about luddie .
what the hell' s he doing here ?
oh , he' s here all the time .
hello !
sorry we' re late .
mom .
oh .
oh , thank you .
dad .
darling .
uncle willy .
oh , who have we got here ?
don' t feel self conscious .
hepburns !
hepburns !
attention , please .
this is howard .
howard , welcome .
don' t worry , he' s had his lunch .
he likes you .
that' s unusual .
we pay our devotion to the arts here .
a colony we created .
julian' s a painter .
abstract , of course .
what' s the point of painting ... ... something real when you can just take a picture nowadays ?
where do you stand on politics , mr. hughes ?
excuse me ?
we' re all socialists here .
we are not .
you' ve met mr. roosevelt .
what make you of him ?
what are you sniggering at ?
what ?
what was that ?
you just sniggered .
no , no .
the dog .
it seems to be crushing my feet .
oh , my god !
buster !
hey .
hey !
don' t you like dogs ?
i will not have you sniggering at mr. roosevelt .
please leave .
no .
i wasn' t .
i thought everybody liked dogs .
perhaps he had a bad experience .
does it upset you that howard gets more press ?
a bad experience with a dog ?
no , no .
you are such a shy creature , aren' t you ?
perhaps it was a very large dog .
the press can be a damned nuisance .
was it a doberman ?
a doberman , mr. hughes ?
or a dachshund ?
neither , sir .
dachshunds are little dogs , hep dear .
they should all be lined up and shot .
what' s that spanish painting ?
the goya .
goya .
of course .
yes .
yes , mexican .
what was that called ?
anyway , that' s the vulgar press , i' m sure .
do you read much , mr. hughes ?
i try to stay up to snuff on the trade journals , yeah .
snuff ?
these would be flying magazines ?
what was that ?
oh , he' s a little deaf .
pass the goddamn butter , i beg you .
you read flying magazines ?
trade journals .
on engineering .
aviation .
we read books .
howard has to read the trade pieces , mom , because he' s designing a new aeroplane .
oh , really ?
do tell .
well ... ... it' s quite exciting , actually .
it' s a spy plane for the air corps .
a twin engine plane with some ... ... i must admit , some rather unique design features .
you see , it has these two booms at the back ...
luddie built a birdhouse once .
you remember that , dear ?
yes , well , a mere trifle , darling .
i remember the painting !
the painting , it' s called may 18 0 something .
anyway , goya' s vastly overrated .
all the spaniards are .
nonsense !
picasso is sacred .
i' m a urologist .
it was quite aesthetic , really .
a sacred monster .
the birds don' t care for it much , but the bats do .
i' il bet .
that' s such bunk !
do speak up , dear .
nothing , nothing , mrs. hepburn .
nothing .
why did you speak ?
i can' t abide people who speak but have nothing to say .
did you go to mechanic school to learn all this airplane guff ?
no , no , i didn' t , luddie .
no .
well , howard just flew round the world in three days .
i think we' ve had enough about airplanes .
and dogs .
then how did you make all that money ?
we don' t care about money here .
well , that' s because you have it .
would you repeat that ?
you don' t care about money because you' ve always had it .
how did you make all that ... ?
excuse me , i' m speaking .
okay .
thank you .
all right .
some of us choose to work for a living .
speaking of which , i have more of that airplane guff to attend to .
excuse me .
well , seems a rather high strung chap .
you' re a fine bunch of bullies , aren' t you ?
have you talked to mr. mayer about letting you do jane eyre ?
the old philistine won' t budge .
too arty , don' t you know .
i' m convinced the man hasn' t read anything longer than a katzenjammer kids in his life .
no fair , kicking .
you have to use the mallet .
really , darling , you can' t retire from the field of battle like that ... ... or they' il never respect you .
katie , i don' t understand .
you' re like a different person in there .
they just expect me to be a certain way .
there' s only one real kate , and that' s your kate .
over in hollywood , aviation tycoon howard hughes is cooking up something big .
even as he edits his new picture , he' s been secretly meeting with the u. s. air corps .
we applaud his patriotism and look forward to his newest marvel .
you know how many allied ships we lost because of u boat attacks ?
no .
six hundred and eighty one ships ... ... just this year so far .
the army needs a new airplane to fly the troops to europe .
these ships , they' re sitting ducks for the u boats .
you wanna build a troop carrier plane ?
stop thinking like an insect .
not just to carry troops , a plane to carry everything .
the troops and the jeeps and the tanks and whatnot .
here , take a look .
no .
other side .
i figure around 200 feet from nose to tail .
wingspan , around 300 .
we' re gonna need about 24, 000 horsepower .
now , this is just what kaiser and the army are looking for .
they' re gonna pay for it this time .
what are you getting us into ?
well , it' s a big plane , so i' m calling it the hercules .
swell name , isn' t it ?
how heavy you imagine this thing is ?
say around 200 tons .
well , i didn' t say it was gonna be easy .
all right , boys , i want you to rig up something like this .
should give the proper uplift ratios and reduce need for torque support on the front .
we are not getting enough production out of jane russell' s breasts .
i want smooth titties , gentlemen .
smooth titties .
it' s all in engineering , isn' t it , odie ?
howard ... ... do you really think they' re gonna let you put out a whole movie just about tits ?
sure .
who doesn' t like tits ?
good afternoon , gentlemen .
sorry i' m late .
please record that mr. hughes has arrived and this session is now called to order .
i yield the floor to mr. breen .
mr. hughes ... ... members of the committee , i' ve reviewed the photoplay entitled the outlaw ... ... and i can state that i have never seen anything so unacceptable ... ... as the shots of the mammaries of the character named rio .
for almost half the picture , the girl' s mammaries , which are quite large ... ... and prominent , are shockingly uncovered .
for this reason , i concluded the picture appeals only to prurient interests ... ... and should be denied the motion picture association' s seal of approval .
really , mr. hughes .
thank you , mr. breen .
mr. hughes .
thank you , mr. chairman .
mr. breen .
it' s good to see you again .
i haven' t seen you all since that situation with all the violence in scarface .
the situation here revolves around miss russell' s mammaries .
mr. breen feels that they are too prominent , yes ?
more prominent than other mammaries have been up on the screen ?
well , i hope to dispel that notion .
jean harlow .
ann sheridan .
irene dunne .
claudette colbert .
rita hayworth .
betty grable .
and the lovely miss jane russell .
now , all these shots , save for miss russell , were enlarged from pictures ... ... that received mr. breen' s seal of approval .
now , as you' ve probably noticed by now , they all contain mammaries .
i will ask my associate to join me now .
may i introduce ... ... dr. ludlow branson of columbia university .
dr. branson ... ... is a mathematician of some note .
yes .
and he will now demonstrate ... ... that in fact ... ... miss russell' s mammaries are no more prominent ... ... than any of these other fine ladies ' .
doctor .
doctor ... ... you forgot your calipers .
gentlemen , mr. hughes .
let us commence by calling this ... ... mammary exhibit number one .
now , you' il see that the length of the actual cleavage ... ... if i may , is ... ... 5 inches and a quarter .
now if we move to mammary exhibit ...
hollywoodland .
movie tycoon howard hughes must have the greatest job in the land .
every night , the lucky guy escorts a different beautiful woman ... ... to a different dazzling event .
the twa king always talks up his airline as he escorts a succession ...
the hercules , ladies and gentlemen .
the hercules .
a plane , a boat , a flying city .
don' t forget , every bill comes to me .
they don' t pay for anything .
those men decide whether to fund the plane , so i need them happy .
you do what it takes .
you betcha , boss .
how are the girls in the bomb department ?
well , let' s put it this way , it' il be a regular boob buffet .
i don' t think the air corps men will have trouble scoring .
good .
and inside , 700 brave american soldiers ... ... a dozen sherman tanks all winging their way over the atlantic ... ... free from the threats of the u boats below .
could jules verne himself have ever imagined anything so magnificent ?
could he have imagined her mammoth wingspan , longer than a football field ?
don' t you see how this demeans me ?
since when do you care about scandal rags ?
every time there' s a picture of you with another woman , it' s a slap in the face .
don' t you understand that ?
well , that' s overstating it .
joan crawford , ginger rogers , linda darnell , joan fontaine ... ... and now bette davis , for god' s sake .
look , they' re cracker jack candy , honey .
they don' t mean anything to me .
oh , very nice .
you' re the one that said that all men are predators .
i mean , it' s all in darwin , remember ?
and am i to expect this behavior to continue after the wedding ?
what is really bothering you , kate ?
is it the women or the publicity ?
can' t you eat ice cream from a bowl like everyone else in the world ?
don' t you dare .
yeah .
no , odie , this is not a good time .
for chrissakes , we can' t make the hercules if we don' t have any aluminum .
wait .
i can hear you better now .
tell the war production board ... ... that this is an essential strategic operation .
if they' re giving aluminum to boeing , they can give some to hughes aircraft .
don' t set the ice cream ...
we gotta think of something else .
if we can' t get aluminum , we' il find another way .
you tell me .
we' il find some alloy that works just as well .
right .
look ...
lf we can' t get aluminum , we' il use wood .
you can' t make a plane out of wood .
why not ?
the damn thing is a flying boat , right ?
what do they use to make boats ?
oak .
and think of the hercules like a flying spanish galleon .
spanish galleons can weigh 1200 tons .
good luck today .
we just have to find the right wood .
something light but strong .
morning , kate .
pine , cedar , maybe birch .
catch .
from my farm .
if you like it , i can get you a bushel .
trouble with mr. hughes ?
there' s too much howard hughes in howard hughes .
that' s the trouble .
beautiful .
don' t you take christmas off ?
nice to see you .
sorry , i' ve got grease on my hands .
have we got something to show you .
take a look .
the xf 11 reconnaissance flier .
spy plane , really .
designed every inch of her myself .
she' s got a top speed of 450 ... ... which means she can outrun anything they throw against her .
after the japs stole my h 1 design for their zeros ... ... i needed to do them one better .
yeah , she' s my buck rogers ship .
she' s a looker .
okay , what do you got for me ?
jiminy cricket .
seating capacity for 60 .
wingspan , 123 feet .
four double cyclone engines .
her ceiling' s 25, 000 feet .
gross weight ?
86, 000 , wing loading of 41 pounds .
so less drag on the plane in thinner air .
so high cruise power , you' re looking at a top speed of around 340 .
giving her a range of about 3000 miles .
cross country .
nonstop .
bob ... ... you know something ?
you are a son of a bitch .
yeah .
bob , you got something on your suit .
yeah .
on your lapel .
you got something on your lapel .
right there , bob .
you missed it .
right there .
clean it off , would you ?
here .
thanks .
no , throw it away .
no , over there .
thanks .
so , what do you call her ?
the constellation , but we can change that .
no , no .
it' s pretty .
i like her .
so , what kind of deal can you give me ?
what kind of deal can you give me ?
the first 40 planes off the assembly line .
that should give us about two years ' exclusivity .
hell , more than that .
united and american don' t have the imagination for a plane like this .
two years ahead of juan trippe , then .
how much ?
four hundred and fifty thousand each .
so that' s 18 million for the first 40 .
hell , twa can' t afford that .
the damn airline' s flat broke .
guess i' il just have to pay for them myself .
build them , bob .
send the bill to noah dietrich .
oh , and thank you .
merry christmas .
you' ve just placed the largest order for airplanes in the history of the damn planet .
lockheed sent us a bill for $ 18 million .
don' t get all hysterical on me , noah .
it isn' t good for you .
this is a lot of money for planes .
i know it' s a lot of money .
it' s too damn much .
you think i' ve got $ 18 million in petty cash ?
i should' ve told you .
it slipped my mind .
slipped your mind ?
oh , for ...
right .
i' il get back to you .
bye .
how could $ 18 million slip your mind ?
hey , honey .
what are you doing home ?
you' re not one for tears , and , well ... ... neither am i , so it' s best to come out with it .
i' ve met someone .
i' ve fallen in love and i' m moving out .
if i could make it any more gentle , i would .
but i can' t , so ... ... there we both are .
let' s be honest .
it' s all been a grand adventure , but it couldn' t possibly last .
we' re too alike , you and i.
you met someone ?
someone more appropriate .
to me , i mean .
what does that mean , " more appropriate " ?
someone more attuned to my needs .
look at me , katie .
stop acting .
i' m not acting .
i wonder if you even know anymore .
don' t be unkind .
you ... ?
you wanna go ?
go on .
actresses are cheap in this town , darling .
and i got a lot of money .
this is beneath you .
no , no , this is exactly me .
you tell me you' re leaving me , and you have the nerve to expect graciousness ?
i expect a little maturity .
i expect you to face the situation like an adult who ...
don' t talk down to me !
don' t you ever talk down to me !
you are a movie star .
nothing more .
don' t answer it .
what is it , howard ?
hey , noah ... ... i need you to get to penney' s and buy me some clothes .
penney' s isn' t open .
oh , shit .
it' s 2 in the morning .
yeah , that' s right .
well , first thing tomorrow , then , all right ?
i need two new suits off the rack .
one light and one dark .
three white shirts and three pairs of white tennis shoes .
got that ?
yeah .
no , no .
make it woolworth' s .
woolworth' s .
no , no , penney' s .
penney' s .
all right .
i' il get into it as soon as i can , howard .
all right ?
noah , do you have a recorder ?
no .
are you recording this conversation ?
no .
okay .
i trust you .
howard ...
i need those suits first thing tomorrow .
all right .
wait .
did i say penney' s or woolworth' s ?
penney' s .
better make it sears .
all right , then , sears .
i' m sorry , honey .
if i don' t answer , he' il just call back .
stop there , if you please , miss domergue .
have you had surgery , miss domergue ?
no .
do you have scars of any kind ?
no .
wipe off your lipstick .
that' s much better .
now , you understand that you' d be under contract to me ?
personally .
do you know what that means ?
now turn around for me .
very nice .
you move well .
you live with your family , do you ?
yes .
that' s nice .
tell me something .
how old are you , miss domergue ?
fifteen .
holy mother of god .
well , a car picks me up every morning at 8 , and off i go .
i' m getting my high school diploma .
howard thinks that education is important .
that' s right .
and then , after classes ... ... i' m off for elocution and grooming and fittings .
well , blow me down .
pan am' s working out of the cocoanut grove ?
hello , jack .
hello , juan .
helen , good to see you .
how are you , howard ?
good , thanks .
this is faith domergue .
sit down .
pleasure .
what are you doing here ?
well , i' m out to meet with douglas about the dc 4 .
it' s our new plane , and it is gonna be a pip , let me tell you .
how' s the constellation coming ?
good .
great .
so how about letting me steal a peek ?
i don' t think so .
i should be cross with you .
you stole ray loewy from us .
he' s doing our interior design .
that' s right .
he was doing ours .
so ... ... what are your colors ?
stop fishing .
so you have buttons ... ... or zippers ?
i' m sorry ?
buttons or zippers for the drapes on the sleeping berths ?
zippers .
buttons .
so i suppose you' il be expanding on down to mexico .
why do you say that ?
well , your range is 3000 miles .
i' d imagine you' d expand from los angeles to mexico and south america .
hey , that' s a good idea .
anyone got a pen ?
or across the atlantic .
you' ve had enough of this ice cream .
you give me that spoon .
you don' t wanna get your gloves all sticky .
isn' t that too far ?
new york ... ... to newfoundland ... ... to ireland .
to paris .
well ... ... pan am welcomes you .
we' re overbooked as it is .
it' s such a burden doing it all on your own , let me tell you .
so when' s the connie gonna be ready ?
next year maybe .
dc 4 ?
next year .
well , we look forward to her then .
and i to the connie .
i' ve ordered the next 40 after you .
it' s miss ... ?
domergue .
yes , of course .
now , was that a rumba or a samba you were doing ?
it was a samba .
a samba , yes .
howard , i never knew you were such a good dancer .
helen , jack .
good going .
you gave away our entire postwar strategy .
he can' t stop us .
he' s pan am .
he can stop anything .
give me the largest scotch you got .
i don' t know what in the hell you' re so damn giddy about .
excuse me .
jack .
get in touch with joyce and berg .
those are my boys in washington .
set up a meeting with jones , secretary of commerce , old golfing buddy .
slow down .
we' il need terminals in ireland and france .
i wanna get some tax breaks .
if that ass thinks he owns the world , he' s got another thing coming .
pan am owns europe .
we ought to think about mexico .
to hell with mexico .
no airline should have a monopoly on flying the atlantic .
it just isn' t fair .
he owns pan am , he owns congress .
he owns the civil aeronautics board , but he does not own the sky .
we' re in a street fight with that son of a bitch .
i' ve been fighting high hat ivy league pricks like him my whole life .
and listen , fire ray loewy .
you goddamn heard me ?
fire ray loewy .
he' s spying for trippe .
that shitheel knew all about the buttons .
spies in my midst , jack .
spies in my midst .
hello , howard .
roland .
so ... ... what can i do for you ?
i want all the pictures you have of kate hepburn and spencer tracy .
all the negatives .
and i want you to kill the story .
howard , he' s a married man .
he' s a catholic .
they' re movie stars .
fair game all around .
my office knows where i am , howard .
i' m not gonna kill you , roland .
i don' t do that .
how much ?
not for sale .
how much ?
not for sale .
you ever cheat on your wife , roland ?
you ever screw a colored girl ?
you ever steal anything ?
you ever hurt anyone ?
good night , howard .
you ever go to a communist party meeting , roland ?
twa stock .
how much ?
fifty thousand shares .
ten .
all right .
this isn' t gonna be that easy .
he' s been making big contributions on both sides of the aisle .
and jack frye is out there lobbying everybody in town .
the french and british ambassadors are lined up on his side .
i' m telling you , twa is serious about going international .
okay .
point , mr. hughes .
i think it' s time for you to introduce the community airline bill ... ... on the floor of the senate .
is it done ?
my people are finishing it right now .
i also have to get you on the committee investigating the national defense .
on the committee or chairman ?
i could be much more effective as chairman .
it' s a great public platform .
you know , it generates a lot of press .
wasn' t truman chairman of that committee ?
yeah , right .
he' s vice president .
look what he did with it .
no , i think ...
i think chairman .
what do you think ?
chairman .
that is interesting .
yeah .
let me show you these specs for the dc 4 .
ava , what do you think about trans world airlines ?
transcontinental and western doesn' t fit anymore .
we' re international , we need a name that reflects that .
trans world is good .
kind of peppy .
twa , right ?
that way you don' t need to repaint any of the planes .
that' s you .
always pinching pennies .
hand me my wrap .
knock it off .
i have something for you .
stay here .
what the hell is this ?
it' s a present .
go on , open it .
oh , a box of trash .
you shouldn' t have .
keep looking , keep looking .
it' s a kashmiri sapphire .
i had my boys all over the damn globe looking for this .
why ?
because .
look .
it matches your eyes .
i am not for sale .
for chrissakes , it' s just a present .
you can' t buy me , howard , so stop trying .
don' t buy me any more diamonds or sapphires or any other damn thing .
you can buy me dinner .
how about that ?
jesus , ava .
it' s bad enough i have to endure those gym shoes of yours .
but i get all dolled up and we go out in this jalopy without a hood .
ava , will you marry me ?
no , howard .
well , why not , for heaven' s sake ?
in the first place , i don' t love you .
in the second place , i' m still married .
look , you got girls stashed all over town .
you got a damn harem just at the bel air .
marry one of your bungalow girls .
those are employees .
i won' t marry an employee .
how would that look ?
what is going on ?
oh , my god !
goddamn it !
faith !
faith , what the hell ?
look out !
goddamn , what the hell are you doing ?
are you okay , lady ?
what are you doing with her ?
we are going to dinner .
