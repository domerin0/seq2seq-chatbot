they think they' re too good for regular people .
he says he was in here awhile ago and the place was a mess .
we' il hurry so we don' t keep you out too long .

we gotta cover the floor , the furniture , everything , so we don' t spill on nothin ' .
lf you want to sit in here with a tarp over your head , you' re welcome to it .

it' s a small job .
we' il go in the side door here .

excuse me , mr. lonnegan .
miss barnes , i' m going home a little early .
lf there are any calls , tell them they can reach me here tomorrow morning .
mr. lonnegan ?
i wanna see it one more time .
i can' t do it .
we got telegraph inspectors all over the place .
one more time isn' t gonna make much difference .
we got 400 grand coming in from the coast next week .

lf it works again tomorrow , i' il finance the whole thing .
half a million dollars .
sixty forty , we split .

how do we know it won' t be a month ?
lonnegan here' s a banker .
he can get the money without any questions asked .
we can' t keep goin ' into shaw' s place and cleanin ' up on long shots .
he' s bound to get wise .

you know him , or don' t you ?
yeah , but i don' t know where he is .
well , we do .
he' s chumming around with a big c named henry gondorff .
ring any bells ?
every bunco man in the country knows gondorff .
well , there' s word he' s gonna run a con on the south side here .
we' ve got a year old florida warrant on him , but it' s a thin beef .
he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold .
all we want you to do is pick up hooker for us .
why don' t you pick him up yourself ?
lf word gets out the feds are in on it , gondorff will fold up the whole thing .
wouldn' t that be too bad .
then you' d have to move out of this nice office you' ve got here .
don' t crack wise with me , flatfoot .
i spent too much time in dumps like this eating gondorff' s dust ... while you guys in the bunco squads get rich tipping him off !
that' s not gonna happen this time .
we' re not gonna tell the police we' re here .
you keep your mouth shut and do a job , there' il be reward bucks in it for you .
and you better take it , ' cause i can make you work for us without it .
what the hell good is hooker to you ?
he' s gonna set up gondorff for us .
he' il never do it .
i think he will .
he' s there .
let' s get on it .
what' s the line on exponent ?
uh ... 5 to 1 .
aah .
how' s it going ?
ah , nothing yet .
i had a good one on the lead at lincoln fields , but he faded .
best we had the last hour was love potion at rockingham , and she was 5 to 1 .
all the long shots coming in today .
take 4 to 1 if you have to .
okay .
you can forget the boodle , eddie .
he could hit us for 15 grand at 4 to 1 .
we can' t handle that .
give him the shutout .
okay .

you want a drink or something ?
no .
we want to talk to you about henry gondorff .
yeah ?
i don' t think i know him .
give yourself a couple of seconds .
you wouldn' t want to lie to me .
lt. snyder here says you' ve done a lot of confidence work in his town .
oh , yeah ?
lt. snyder doesn' t know shit .
you ain' t got nothin ' on me .
yeah ?
how ' bout counterfeiting ?
we' ve got a tip that gondorff is gonna run a con on the south side here .
all you' ve gotta do is tell us when he' s gonna play his chump .
we come in at the sting , make the pinch , and ... you walk out free as a bird .
no .
you wanna spend the next 20 years in a federal penitentiary ... starting tonight ?
i' il make parole .
like hell .
you won' t even get a review .
i' il chance it .
okay . lf that' s the way you want it .
we might even provide you with a little company on your way up the river .
that wife of luther coleman' s what was her name ?
alva .
alva .
that' s it .
alva coleman .
pretty fair grifter in her time .
snyder' s given us quite a folder on her .
nothing major by itself , but , uh , put ' em all together , it could add up to a lot of years .
you stink , mister .
don' t be a sap .
it' s not her i want .
lf you' re too dumb to save yourself , there' s no sense dragging her down with ya .
it' s over , hooker .
you can save me a lot of trouble .
but i' m gonna get henry gondorff whether you help me out or not .
will you wait ' til the chump is played ?
hell , yes .
we don' t care about the mark .
he deserves what he gets .
i mean completely played .
you come in before we beat him , and i' il kill him .
all right , hooker .
but you try to take it on the lam , and we' il shoot you down on sight .
as long as i get to finish the play .
what is it , kid ?
you' re not saying much .
just got the jumps .
come in .
things are a little slow .
i wanna open the round for the girls .
sure .
take it easy , kid .
we' re not gonna lose him now .
we had him ten years ago when he decided to be somebody .
believe me , i' ve seen enough to know .
ten .
twenty .
thirty .
go .
thirty one .
aagh .
how many guys you conned in your life , henry ?
i don' t know .
two , three hundred .
sometimes we played two a day when i was with o' shea' s mob .
of course , chicago was a rigged town .
the fix was in ; the dicks took their end without a beef .
we had it down to a business .
and it really stunk , kid .
no sense in bein ' a grifter if it' s the same thing as bein ' a citizen .
i got packin ' to do .
i' m gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow .
.. [ calliope ]
i wouldn' t ask you to do this , you know , if it weren' t for luther .
nothin' s gonna make up for luther .
revenge is for suckers .
i' ve been griftin ' 30 years .
i never got any .
then why' re you doin ' it ?
it seems worthwhile , doesn' t it ?
see ya .
looks like he missed you .
yeah , yeah .
this time , anyway .
good night , mrs. hillard .
i was wonderin ' if you might want to come out for a while , maybe have a drink or something .
you move right along , don' t you ?
hey , i don' t mean nothin ' by it .
i just don' t know many regular girls , is all .
and you expect me to come out just like that ?
lf i expected somethin ' , i wouldn' t still be standin ' here in the hall .
i don' t even know you .
you know me .
i' m just like you .
it' s 2 : 00 in the morning , and i don' t know nobody .
come on , henry .
knock off .
you' ve done everything you can .
hmm .
yeah ?
polk .
polk , this is hooker .
ready ?
yeah , go ahead .
everything' s all set .
there' il be a guy or two at the door .
nobody' s carrying any heaters , so you shouldn' t have any trouble .
okay .
see you there .
she was gonna kill you , kid .
her name' s loretta salino .
lonnegan' s people set her up in the diner .
come on .
let' s get out of here .
come on !
come on !
she could have killed me last night .
too many people could have seen you go in her room .
she was a real professional .
used to work in the dutch schultz mob .
who are you ?
gondorff asked me to look after you .
snyder , we just got a tip that gondorff' s mark ... is some big new york wheel .
as soon as we' re inside , you get him out of there fast ... before the reporters show up .
i don' t want any big shots around to mess this up for me .
all right , let' s go !
let' s go , guys !
the flag is up , kid .
anytime , j. j. i' m workin ' on it .
we got one , billie .
