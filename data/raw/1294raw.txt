come to los angeles .
the sun shines bright .
the beaches are wide and inviting .
and the orange groves stretch as far as the eye can see .
there are jobs aplenty .
land is cheap .
every workingman can have his own house .
and inside every house , a happy all american family .
you can have all this .
and who knows ?
you could even be discovered ... ... become a movie star , or at least see one .
life is good in los angeles .
lts paradise on earth .
thats what they tell you , anyway .
because theyre selling an image .
theyre selling it through movies , radio and television .
ln the hit show , badge of honor , the l. a. cops walk on water ... ... as they keep the city clean of crooks .
youd think this place was the garden of eden .
but theres trouble in paradise ... ... and his name is meyer harris cohen , mickey c , to his fans .
local l. a. color to the nth degree .
and his number one bodyguard ... ... johnny stompanato .
mickey cs the head of organized crime in these parts .
he runs dope , rackets and prostitution .
he kills a dozen people a year .
and the dapper little gent does it in style .
and every time his pictures on the front page ... ... its a black eye for the image of los angeles .
because how can organized crime exist ... ... in the city with the best police force in the world ?
something has to be done .
but nothing too original , because , hey , this is hollywood . what worked for al capone would work for the mickster .
mr. cohen , youre under arrest .
nonpayment of federal income tax .
but all is not well .
sending mickey up has created a vacuum .
and its only a matter of time ... ... before someone with balls of brass tries to fill it .
... you heard it here first ... ... off the record ... ... on the q . t ... ... and very ... ... hush hush .
youre like santa claus with that list .

i was thinking detective bureau .
edmund ... ... youre a political animal .
you have the eye for human weakness , but not the stomach .
youre wrong , sir . would you be willing to plant evidence on a suspect you knew to be guilty ... ... in order to insure an indictment ? weve been over this .
yes or no ?
no . would you beat a confession out of a suspect you knew to be guilty ? would you shoot a hardened criminal in the back ... ... in order to offset the chance that some lawyer
then for the love of god ... ... dont be a detective . work where you dont have to make those kind of choices .
dudley , i know you mean well ... ... but i dont need to do it the way you did ... or my father .

bloody christmas .
the press love to label .
you should know this is bigger than the police board .
the grand jurys convening .
lndictments may be handed down . will you testify ?
no , sir .
i wont .
district attorney loew ?
you and officer stensland brought the liquor to the station .
stensland was already drunk .
appearing as a voluntary witness against him ... ... could offset damage to yourself .
i wont testify against him , or anyone else .
this man is a disgrace .
your badge and gun , officer .
youre suspended from duty .
dismissed .
we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the department .
justice has to be served .
of course lil testify .
lm glad you feel that way , edmund .
most dont .
they think silence and integrity are the same thing .
not exactly the image of the ... ... new lapd were trying to create . welcome to los angeles , the city of the future .
may i make a suggestion , sir ?
by all means .
the public will expect the department to sweep this under the carpet .
dont .
shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured .
force them to retire .
but somebody has to swing .
so indict , try and convict ... ... richard stensland and bud white .
secure them jail time .
the message will be clear .
this department ... ... will not tolerate officers who think theyre above the law .
dick stensland is an embarrassment as a policeman .
hes had rotten fitness reports from every c. o. hes served under .
but bud white is a valuable officer . whites a mindless thug .
no , edmund ... ... but he can answer " yes " to those questions lve asked you before .
the department and the public need role models .
clean cut , forthright men the public can admire .
sergeant ... ... lil promote you ... ... to lieutenant ... ... effective immediately .
detective lieutenant .
ed , youre 30 .
your father didnt make lieutenant till he was 33 .
i know that , sir . when he made lieutenant , it was as a detective .
before we start polishing our laurels ... ... itd look better if we had a corroborative witness .
that wont be easy to come by .
the men hate a stool pigeon .
jack vincennes .
he hit one of the mexicans .
a veteran like vincennes might be willing to admit his own culpability ... ... but hed never rat out a fellow officer .
jacks the technical advisor on badge of honor .
he lives for it .
thats how to get to him .
ld like you to observe , ed .
call sergeant vincennes .
bright kid .
you may reap the benefit ... ... but are you ready to be despised in the department ?
yes , sir , i am .
so be it .
sergeant , weil get right to it .
nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting ezekiel garcia .
but we have a witness who will name names and testify that you hit back ... ... only after being hit .
you will testify against 3 officers ... ... who have earned their pensions and plead ignorance about the rest .
no thanks .
lm not a snitch .
lil guarantee you a slap on the wrist , a brief suspension ... ... followed by a temporary transfer from narcotics to vice .
you transfer out of vice , youil be back on the show .
the show ?
badge of honor , vincennes .
we need to tone down your profile for a bit .
i doubt youve ever taken a stupid breath .
dont start now .
okay , lil do it .
the grand jury will hear ... ... your testimony tomorrow .
and so it goes ... ... detective lieutenant .
ace them at the grand jury tomorrow , son . wear a smart looking suit and ace them .
and ed ... ... lose the glasses .
so youre the stellar witness .
i should have known . whats the chief throwing you ?
throwing me ?
yeah , exley , whats the payoff ?
youre the payoff expert .
lm just doing my duty .
come on , youre playing an angle here , college boy .
youil get something so you dont have to hobnob with the cops ... ... whoil hate you for snitching .
lf theyre making you detective , watch out .
some bureau guys will burn in this and youil be working with their friends . what about you ?
lm snitching 3 old timers whoil be fishing in oregon next week .
next to you , lm clean ... ... and smart .
edmund j. exley to chambers .
and remember ... ... bud white will fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life .
captain , what do you want ?
call me dudley .
dudley ... ... what do you want ?
look , lad , i admire your refusal to testify ... ... and your loyalty to your partner .
i admire you as a policeman ... ... and your adherence to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job .
lm impressed with your punishment of women beaters .
do you hate them , wendell ?
what do you want ?
theyre yours .
take them .
theres no bill on me ?
4 witnesses recanted their testimony . why ?
they had a change of heart .
stensland ?
your partners through .
scapegoat on the chiefs orders .
a year from his pension .
exley !
exley got what he wanted .
as a politician he exceeds even myself .
the department needs smart men like exley ... ... and direct men ... ... like you .
look , i need you for an assignment the chiefs given me .
a duty few men are fit for ... ... but you were born for .
youd be working out of homicide at city hall .
homicide ? working cases ?
your talents lie elsewhere , wendell .
lts a muscle job .
youil do as i say and ask no questions .
do you follow my drift ?
ln technicolor , sir .
meet tony brancato and anthony trombino ... ... two rising lieutenants in the mickey cohen rackets . with the dapper little gent in prison ... ... who knows how far theyil go .
the skys the limit .
oh , well .
meet deuce perkins , mickey cohens narcotics lieutenant .
could he be behind the hits ?
ls he consolidating organized crime power ?
i suppose not .
2 man triggers are punching the tickets on the micksters muscle .
meanwhile , rumor has it the lapd ... ... has set up a not so welcome wagon to dishearten the criminal element ... ... from filling the void left by mickeys absence . when i know more , dear readers , so will you .
off the record , on the q . t ... ... and very ... ... hush hush .
with mickey cohen in prison , los angeles is organized crime free .
the chief wants to keep it that way .
ln cleveland , youre an organized crime associate ... ... in desperate need of re education in the ways of polite society .
i hear things .
like those 2 men shooter teams .
theyre 86ing cohens lieutenants . what do you want ? we want you to go home .
picture book smut , men .
theres been a bunch of this found at crime scenes lately .
quality ranges from piss poor to ... ... very well done .
look whos back from suspension . were honored , sergeant jack .
look at that .
the great jerk off case of 1953 .
ls there someplace youd rather be ?
yeah , working narcotics , looking for cohens missing h.
yeah , finding 25 pounds of heroin would get you plenty of ink .
you shouldve thought of that before bloody christmas .
make a major case . lts the only way youil get out of here .
dismissed , gentlemen .
go get the facts , jack .

the nite owl massacre .
hyperbole aside ... ... this is a heinous crime that requires swift resolution .
six victims .
one of them , one of our own .
dick stensland .
he was a nite owl regular , in the wrong place at the wrong time .
robbery is the likely motive . we have rubber glove smears on the register and forensics ... ... tend toward a trio of shooters . we do have one hot lead .
three negro juveniles ... ... were seen discharging shotguns in griffith park .
a park ranger l . d. d them as driving a 1948 1950 mercury coupe ... ... maroon in color .
an hour ago a canvassing crew found a news vendor ... ... who saw a maroon merc coupe parked by the nite owl at 1 a . m .
dmv has come up with a registration list of merc coupes .
48 two man teams will shake three names apiece .
lnterrogations will be led by lt. edmund exley .
enough on that !
gentlemen , just go out and get them .
use all necessary force .
the people of los angeles demand it .

lil take those odds .
we got it from here .
you two should bring along a photographer .
i need an address on a customer of yours .
her name is lynn .
thats all i got to go on ?
yeah .
you already know who i mean , so cough it up .
theres a billing address and a delivery address .

what happened to the other guy , buzz ?
buzz meeks no longer works for me .
lefferts looked beat up christmas eve but didnt act it . why ?
i think shed been hit in the face with a tennis racket .
she is ... was ... ... a big doubles fan .
youre a known associate of a woman killed in a mass murder .
want to go downtown to discuss this ?
ls this official ?
somehow i have the feeling this is more personal with you .
all right , then ... ... are you concerned about criminal matters peripheral to the murders ?
not at the moment .
youre not obligated to report them ?
why were lefferts eyes black ?
i needed a rita hayworth to fill out my little studio . what little studio ? well , theres gardner , russell , monroe , turner ....
lynn bracken is my veronica lake .
i use girls that look like movie stars .
sometimes i employ a plastic surgeon . when the work was done , thats when you saw us .
lts why her mom couldnt l . d. her .
jesus fucking christ !
no , pierce morehouse patchett .
i sense youre on your best behavior , but thats all lm saying .
lf you persist , weil meet with my attorney .
would you like lynn brackens address ?
i got her address .

i know youre not asleep .

use words like that , you might make me mad .
but , do you know ?
yeah , i know .
patchetts running whores ... ... cut to look like movie stars .
and , judging by his address , something bigger on the side .
he doesnt want any attention .
thats right .
our motives are selfish so were cooperating .
so cooperate . why was susan lefferts at the nite owl ?
i dont know .
i never heard of the nite owl till today .

youre different , officer white .
youre the first man in years who didnt tell me i look like veronica lake .
you look better than veronica lake .
pierce patchett ?
he takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us .
he doesnt let us use narcotics and he doesnt abuse us .
can your policemans mentality grasp those contradictions ?
he had you cut to look like veronica lake .
no .

his business is his business .
sugar , louis told me you went sissy up at casitas .
you couldnt do the time , so you got a big white boy to look after you .

louis gave it up at casitas .

lm sorry . lts none of my business .
he tied me to the radiator .
i watched him beat my mother to death with a tire iron ... ... and he left me there .
three days before a truant officer found us .
they never found the old man .
ls that why you became a cop ?
to get even ?
maybe .
do you like it ?
i used to .
now its all strong arm , sitting duck stuff .
lf i could ... ... get a chance to work homicide ... ... like a real detective ....
that prick , exley , he shot the wrong guys . whoever killed stenslands still around .
i know it in here .
i know it .
somethings wrong with the nite owl .
i just cant prove it , thats all .
lm not smart enough .
lm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless .
youre wrong .
you found patchett .
you found me .
youre smart enough .
bud white ! what brings you down to the basement ?
i got a couple of nite owl questions .
dont know if you read the papers , but that case is closed .
anything bother you about it ?
the fact that the pack up boys havent hauled this shit out of here yet .
the suspects 3 shotguns match the strike marks on the shell casings .
what more do you want ?
theres blood on the wall here .
i thought everyone got shot in the mens room .
that is stenslands blood .
blow to the head .
probably unconscious when they dragged him in the john .
did they hit anyone else ?
no , but he was a cop .
probably tried to do something .
grilled cheese , black coffee .
someone was sitting next to him .
2 victims were women ?
yeah , patti deluca , the night shift waitress , and a susan lefferts .
susan lefferts .
yeah , what about her ?
youre welcome !
mrs. lefferts ?
lm officer white , lapd .
tell me about the boyfriend you mentioned at the coroners office .
i told you i didnt approve of that boyfriend .
he was too old for you .
and you let him be fresh with me .
they came here one day when i wasnt home .
mrs. jensen next door said ... ... she saw susies boyfriend and another man and ... ... she heard a ruckus . what was his name ? we werent properly introduced .
susie gave him a nickname , muns or luns .
stens ? was it stens ?
maybe .
i dont know .
look .
thats him .
thats him .
you said a neighbor heard a ruckus . was it outside ?
lnside ?
outside .
and then mrs. jensen said they kept going under the house .
you have to leave now , officer .
whats through here ?
just a room full of old things .
dont move that !
dont mind the smell .
i think a rat died behind the wall .
my susie was a good girl .
she was never in any kind of trouble at all !
leland meeks .
never heard of you .
they call me buzz .
was it a rat ?
yeah , a great big one .
here .
compliments of the police department .
stomach of the week from a motel homicide .
unemployed actor had frankfurter , french fries , alcohol and sperm .
hell of a last supper , dont you think ?
anything bothering you about the nite owl case ?
that you guys wont let it get filed away .
what do you mean ?
bud white grilled me on it today .
bud white ?
hes not as dumb as i thought .
did he say where he was going after he talked to you ?
let my daughter rest in peace !
mrs. lefferts , i want to ask a few questions .
officer white already checked under the house .
under the house ? where ?
out back .
all he found was rodents .
i need an l . d. on this as soon as possible .
talk only to me on this one .
i need your help .
lm busy right now . why dont you ask your boys in homicide ?
i cant .
i need someone outside of homicide .
tail bud white until he goes on duty this evening .
do me a real favor and leave me alone .
you make the negroes for the nite owl killings ?
what ?
lts a simple question .
why in the world do you want to dig deeper ... ... into the nite owl killings ... ... lieutenant ?
rollo tomasi .
ls there more or do i have to guess ?
rollo was a purse snatcher .
my father ran into him off duty .
he shot my father 6 times and got away clean .
no one knew who he was .
i made the name up to give him personality .
whats your point ?
rollo tomasis the reason i became a cop .
i wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it .
it was supposed to be about justice .
then somewhere along the way i lost sight of that .
whyd you become a cop ?
i dont remember .
what do you want , exley ?
i want to solve this thing .
nite owl was solved .
no .
i want to do it right .
even if it means paying the consequences ?
all right , college boy , lil help .
but theres a case your boys in homicide dont care about .
they think its just another hollywood " homo " cide .
but i dont .
you help me with mine , lil help you with yours .
deal ?
deal .
johnny stompanato .
officer wendell white .
hows tricks , paesano ?
i aint your paesano .
i aint in the snitch business anymore .
you know a guy named buzz meeks ?
works for pierce patchett .

youre muscle for hire .
meeks is muscle for hire .
you tell me .
yeah , i remember now .
meeks is a run down ex cop .
same as youre going to be some day .
thats all youil get .
keep your 20 bucks .
what do i get if i give you your balls back , you wop cocksucker ?
there was a rumor going around ... ... that meeks had a line on a large supply of h.
and ?
and nothing !
he skipped out .
bullshit .
how would meeks get his hands on a large supply of heroin ?
youre right .
lts probably bullshit .
even if he did , he could never unload it .
not without drawing all kinds of attention .
maybe thats why hes under a house in elysian park not smelling too good ... ... paesano .
maybe whites not so dumb after all .
we got rita hayworth at the morgue , and now veronica lake with white .
i think your case and my case are connected . lts fleur de lis again .
fleur de lis ?
whatever you desire .
porno .
high class whores cut to look like movie stars . who knows what else .
reynolds , the kid that got killed , was involved .
so is pierce patchett .
the millionaire ?
i think we should go talk to him .
first i want to brace stompanato .

since when do two bit hoods and hookers give out autographs ? what ?
lapd .

a hooker cut to look like lana turner is still a hooker .
she just looks like lana turner .
she is lana turner .
she is lana turner .
how was i supposed to know ?
i believe the nite owls your area of expertise , mr. exley .
i saw you on television getting your medal .
and youre ... ... that other hollywood celebrity policeman , arent you ?
the veronica lake look alike works for you .
shes one of your whores .
a vulgar term . whys she seeing bud white ? why do men and women usually see each other ?
fleur de lis . " whatever you desire .
an actor named ... ... matt reynolds .
no ?
nothing ?
we want some answers .
we all want something .
the guys as cool as they come .
lieutenant exley , come in , please .

exley .
the coroner wants to talk to you .
he says he has your l . d.
tell him sergeant vincennes is coming in to talk to him .
lil drop you at your car . where are you going ?
lynn brackens .

leland meeks .
buzz meeks ?

bad rep .
thanks .
just the facts , " jack .
just the facts .
anything else ?
leland meeks worked vice 39 41 .
i need to see his arrest records .
miss bracken ... ... lm lieutenant exley .
i know .
bud told me all about you .
ls that so ?
and what did white have to say ?
he said you were smart .
he also said you were a coward , and that youd screw yourself to get ahead .
lets concentrate on my smarts .
pierce patchett made you , didnt he ?
taught you how to dress , talk and think .
i am very impressed with the results .
but i need answers .
and if i dont get them , lil take you and patchett down .
pierce patchett can take care of himself .
and lm not afraid of you .
and you forget one thing , lieutenant ... ... pierce also taught me how to fuck .
and he tells you who to fuck . why does he have you fucking bud white ? what makes you think lm not seeing bud because i want to ?
it would be easier for you if there was an angle , wouldnt it ?
youre afraid of bud because you cant figure out how to play him .
he doesnt follow the same rules of politics as you do .
it makes him dangerous .
i can handle bud white .
can you ?
i see bud because i want to .
i see bud because he cant hide the good inside of him .
i see bud because he makes me feel like lynn bracken ... ... and not some veronica lake look alike who fucks for money .
i see bud because he doesnt know how to disguise who he is .
i see bud for all the ways hes different from you .
dont underestimate me .
the way youve underestimated bud white ?
fucking me and fucking bud arent the same thing .
stop talking about bud white .
come on .
shit .
jack vincennes .
lts going on midnight .
i need 2 minutes , dudley .
lts important .
good thing for you my wife and daughters are at the beach in santa barbara .
do you remember buzz meeks , dudley ?
a disgrace as a police officer .
straight d fitness reports from every c. o. he ever served under . why ?
12 years ago , he was on a vice roust with dick stensland .
they questioned pierce patchett about a blackmail scam .
patchett had sid hudgens photographing prominent businessmen with hookers .
anyway , charges were dropped .
lnsufficient evidence .
you were the supervising officer on that case .
remember anything about it ?
whats this about , boyo ?
it has to do with a murder lve been working with ed exley on .
youre narco , jack , not homicide .
since when do you work with edmund exley ?
lts a private investigation .
i messed something up .
lm trying to make amends .
dont start trying to do the right thing , boyo .
you havent had the practice .
buzz meeks and dick stensland .
so , what does exley make of this ?
i havent told him yet .
i just came from the records room .
have you a valediction , boyo ?
rollo ... ... tomasi .
sergeant vincennes was killed by a . 32 slug to the heart .
time of death , approximately 1 a . m .
although he was found in echo park , forensics indicates the body was moved .
i want 2 man teams to scour that entire neighborhood .
our justice must be swift ... ... and merciless .
that is all .
might i have a word with you ?
were trying to run down a lead on an associate of vincennes .
the records check has led to a dead end . whats the name ?
rollo tomasi ?
you ever heard vincennes mention him ?
no .
no , i havent .
lts probably nothing .
still ... ... keep your eyes open , boyo .
i know its unlikely , but suppose , just for a moment ... ... somebody had a lot of heroin , who would they go to to move it ? white , in my office .
captain .
look , just give me a name .
mickey cohen .
captain ?
i could use your fearsome habits at the victory motel .
when ?
now .
close the door , lad .
youre a bit of a puzzlement to me these days .
you dont seem your old cruel self .
and i had such grand plans for your future . what plans ?
you have your extracurricular activities and i have mine .
we must have a clarification session one of these days .
however ... ... right now ... ... weil brace a man who may know who killed jack vincennes .
so the question is ... ... can i count on you , lad ?
yes or no ?
yes , sir .
i want to know everything you and jack vincennes talked about last night .
start with the l . d. on the corpse .
an ex cop .
leland " buzz " meeks .
an ex cop ?
did jack know him ?
only by reputation .
this is sid hudgens .
lm willing to cooperate .
no need to tie me down .
lts for your own safety . what can you tell us about jack vincennes ?
hollywood jack ?
the big v ?
i can tell you hes on the night train to the big adios .
i had nothing to do with him getting killed , if thats what you mean .
but you were business associates . whats that got to do with anything ?
okay , so we worked together .
it was an information exchange .
i got him first class collars , he got me good stories . we were friends . weil drop that for the moment .
care to comment on pierce patchett ?
you think he had something to do with vincennes getting iced ? wendell , ld like full and docile cooperation on every topic .
okay , okay , okay .
all right .
everyone knows patchetts worth a boatload of greenbacks .
but the man has hobbies too .
he bankrolls b movies under the table .
and try this one on .
hes rumored to be a heroin sniffer .
all in all , a powerful behind the scenes strange o .
and ?
and what ?
reciprocity , mr. hudgens , is the key to every relationship .
he runs call girls .
primo tail fixed up to look like movie stars .
and ?
blackmail shit .
ln my car , in the trunk , under the rug ....
patchett got me to photograph this cop screwing this gorgeous slut named lynn .
she looks like veronica lake .
leave him !
i said leave him be !
get him away from me !
back off !
back off !
i wouldnt trade places with exley right now for all the whiskey in lreland .
dudley , i thought you were going to let the dumb bastard kill me !
learn to pull your punches a little better .
you can uncuff me now , fellas .
fellas ... ... we had a deal .
you , me , patchett , were a team .
hush hush .
anything ?
nothing .
meeks never made an arrest the entire time he worked vice ?
someone mustve pulled the files .
what about the daily report books ?
theyd be buried in the basement .
find them .
did you talk to exley ?
come in out of the rain .
i want to know what happened with exley .
just come in .
are you going to tell me what happened with exley ? we talked .
tell me about him .
later .
now !
you fucked him .
you fucked him .
i thought i was helping you .
lm glad youre here .
i need you to see this .
wait ....
dudley killed jack .
he wants you to kill me .
he showed you the photo , didnt he ?
didnt he ?
think ! !
goddamn you , think ! !
get out !
i checked the daily report books .
dudley , buzz meeks and stensland go way back .
i knew stensland lied to me .
lefferts mother l . d. d stensland as lefferts boyfriend .
stensland pretended he didnt know meeks or her the night that i met ... ... lynn .
stensland and meeks ... ... what the hell were they up to ?
i dont know .
but i think stens killed meeks over heroin . what heroin ?
johnny stompanato told me that meeks had heroin for sale .
meeks ends up dead .
stensland dies at the nite owl .
it wasnt the negroes .
the rape victim lied in her statement .
the first guys to the mercury coupe were breuning and carlisle .
dudleys guys .
they planted the shotguns .
theyd have killed the negroes too if jack and i hadnt shown up .
dudley framed them because they were negroes and had records .
he knew thered be no questions asked ... ... if they were killed resisting arrest .
somehow this is all connected to jacks angle .
sid hudgens ... ... the pictures to blackmail ellis loew ....
a kid got murdered .
to figure this out , we need to work together .
why are you doing this ?
the nite owl made you .
you want to tear all that down ?
with a wrecking ball . want to help me swing it ?
lets go see ellis loew .
find out what the district attorney knows .
you cant go in there .
want me to call the police , mr. loew ?
ask for capt. dudley smith .
tell him were discussing an unemployed actors death at a sunset strip motel .
these are the police .
what do you want ?
i want d. a. bureau men to tail dudley smith and patchett 24 hours a day .
i want you to get a judge to authorize wiretaps on their home phones .
i want authorization to check their bank records .
on what evidence ?
call it a hunch .
absolutely not .
dudley smith is a highly decorated member of the department .
i wont smear his and patchetts name without without what ?
them smearing yours first ? what do they have ?
pictures of you and matt reynolds with your pants down ?
you have any proof ?
the proof had his throat slit .
so far , youre not denying it .
i wont dignify this with answers .
now if you gentlemen will excuse me ... ... l have a press conference for jack vincennes that i have to prepare for .
unless you came to wipe my ass , i believe were through .
dont pull that good cop bad cop crap .
i practically invented it .
so what if some homo actor is dead .
boys , girls , ten of them get off the bus to l. a. everyday .
pull him off me ! !
i dont know how .
i know you think youre the a number one hotshot , but heres the juice .
lf i kill you , 10 lawyers will take your place tomorrow .
they just wont come on a bus .
okay !
dudley and patchett , they ....
oh , my god !
i wouldnt play ball so they set me up !
i gave in !
but the kid heard everything ... ... so they killed him . why ? what are dudley and patchett up to ?
taking over mickey cohens rackets .
because of those pictures i couldnt prosecute them !
oh , jesus !
help me up !
ls that how you ran the good cop bad cop ?
patchett ?
looks like his bodyguard had a conflict of interest .
suicide note .
says he killed jack because jack had figured out his pornography scam .
slicing himself open wasnt his idea .
2 of his fingers are broken .
they held him there .
or drugged him .
dudleys tying up his loose ends .
patchetts dead .
he sent you after me .
lynn .
west hollywood sheriff .
theyre closer than we are .
lil get the car .
keys !
we took her to the station for safekeeping .
hold her as joan smith .
and no one sees her unless i okay it .
someone worked her over .
she wouldnt say who .
see you , exley .
we should talk to lynn .
you do it . what will you do ?
lm going to talk to sid hudgens .
compliment him on his performance at the victory motel .
remember , bud , we need evidence .
lil get the evidence .
are you okay ?
you okay ?
bud hates himself for what he did .
i know how he feels .
i need to know what you can give me on dudley smith .
hes a police captain in business with patchett .
lve never heard of him .
do you have a place to stay ?
lil be okay .
nobody goes in without official l . d. !
hes okay .
