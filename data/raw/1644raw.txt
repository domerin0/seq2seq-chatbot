ursula would have simply loved to have come ... but something came up .
now now , what was it ?
oh , yes .
you all shish kebabbed her !
one minute you' re on top , the next you' re sushi .
now , is that fair , gramps ?
i ask you .

and it' s not even 10 : 00 .
not a bad morning .
hit the deck !
melody !
what have you done to me ?
look at me !
i' m an anchovy !
this isn' t the end , triton !
it' s just the beginning !
after her !
you' il never find me , but i' il find you ... and your precious granddaughter !
we shall not rest until that madwoman is vanquished !
find her !
find her !
i' m sorry .
there is no sign of her .
she' s vanished .
we' il keep trying .
we' il
sweetie , no .
oh , we' ve got to keep melody away from her .
until morgana is found , melody can' t go in the sea .
and neither will i.
but , ariel
i' m sorry , flounder .
but if morgana is anything like ursula , she' il never give up .
this is the only way .
melody can' t know about merpeople or atlantica ... or even you , daddy .
very well , ariel .
you' re right .
sebastian , you will watch over her .
me ?
aww !
melody ?
melody ?
oh , carlotta , have you seen melody ?
not since this morning , your majesty .
louis , melody' s not in here , is she ?
no , your highness , but her birthday cake is .
twelve petite candles .
whoo eee !
this is gonna be some kind of shindig .
yes , sir , a real swanky soiree , as they say .
there' s just one thing missin ' : the guest of honour !
sebastian , you watch over her , " he said .
i' m too old for this !
a crab my age should be retired , getting a tan ... playing sea golf ... sipping a tuna colada !
not baby sitting another teenager .
melody !
hey , scuttle .
hey , sebastian .
what' s kickin ' ?
uh , what' s kickin ' ?
hmm .
l let me see .
don' t rush me .

you know perfectly well what' s kicking !
now , come along .
you gonna be late for the
sorry , sebastian .
melody , child , how many times do i have to tell you ?
it is expressly forbidden foryou to be swimming ...
beyond the safety of the sea wall . beyond the safety of the sea wall .
any such swimmin ' is a reckless disregard of da rules ... don' t ya know ?
stop dat .
oh , sebastian , i can' t help it .
i just love the sea !
hey !
come back here !
you' re just like
like your mother .
hi , melody .
trust me !
this time i' m sure i' ve got it right .
yeah , that' s what you said last time , and i was sore for a week .
oh , stop your carping and stand still .
oh , this is gonna hurt .
yes !
yes !
yes !
uh oh .
oh , it' s just no use .
the power of the trident is just too strong for me to overcome .
i bet ursula could' ve done it .
what was that you said ?
nothin ' .
i' m just sayin '
stop criticizing me !
that' s all my mother ever did was criticize me !
it was always " ursula this " or " ursula that " ... or , " morgana , why can' t you be more like your sister ...
ursula !
well , it isn' t ursula' s fault i got miniaturized .
it' s yours !
is not !
your fault that we had to hide out here for 1 2 frostbitten years .
is not !
your fault that we can never show our faces in polite society again !
you' re really pushing it , small fry .
it' s the locket !
it' s the locket !
this is just the kind of break in the ice we' ve been waiting for .
when ariel' s innocent little daughter ... uncovers the secret of that locket ... she' s going to have lots of questions .
and who' il be right there with all the answers ?
we will .
exactly !
she' il be the perfect tool for triton' s undoing .
and i' il get to be big again .
finally i' il succeed at the one thing my sister never could .
really , really big again !
total domination of the seas !
i' il be huge !
melody , please .
if your mother ever found out you' d been swimming out here
i know , i know .
she' d flip .
i had a thought here .
now , where' d it go ?
hey , sebastian ... what' s my mom got against the ocean anyway ?
i mean , how could there be anything wrong with something so ... wonderful ?
you know what ?
sometimes i even pretend i have fins .
i wish i could tell my mom how i feel .
but she' d never understand .
i can talk to crabs , but not to her .
wait a minute .
it just hit me .
how ' bout you tell ariel ... how you really feel ?
oh , yes , by all means .
just waltz right in and tell her you been out here ... swimming in the ocean !
we could all just have a big party .
the party !
say , that reminds me of somethin ' .
whoa !
oh , your your highness .
sorry .
my fault .
i gotta go .
can' t go to the party without shoes .
if you ask me , she' s a little strange .
i heard she actually talks to fish .
it should make for an interesting party .
i miss you , daddy .
i wish you could be here with us .
mother ?
what are you doing ?
uh , nothing .
i i' il be right up !
melody ?
i' m ready .

well , i' m just here to let you know there are a lot of people downstairs
oh , we' il be right down .
give us two minutes .
right , two now where have i heard that before ?
mom , put down the brush .
it' s hopeless .
oh .

everybody thinks i' m weird .
oh , honey , everyone has trouble fitting in at your age .
i know i did .
i was a regular fish out of water .
you ?
no way .
i' m just so afraid i' m gonna make a total fool of myself .
melody , this isn' t just about the party ... is it ?
is there something you want to talk about ?
you know you can always tell me anything .
well , okay .
i mean , it' s kind of crazy and sort of impossible .
now , don' t freak , but what i dream about ... more than anything in the whole world
how' s it coming ?
oh , melody .
is that you ?
you look beautiful .
he' s right .
now , we' il talk later .

oh , sweetheart , i' m so sorry .
what' s wrong with me ?

being a teenager i is hard , and , uh ... all kids your age feel ... a awkward .
and , um  melody ?
what is this ?
my name' s on here .
that song .
where have i heard it ?
it' s atlantica .
with merpeople and everything .
mother , you always said it was just an old fish tale .
where did you get this ?
i i found it .
you went over the wall , didn' t you ?
actually , i went under it .
i hate that stupid wall .
melody , you know you' re not allowed in the sea .
but why ?
and why does that necklace have my name on it ?
melody , listen to me .
you' re hiding something from me .
y you deliberately disobeyed me !
i never want you going out there again !
do you hear me ?
it' s dangerous in the sea !
how would you know ?
you' ve never even been in it !
m melody , i
oh , no .
ariel , darling ... we knew this day would come .
oh , eric .
you' re right .
it' s time i trusted her with the truth .
oh , now , child , it' s gonna be okay .
you know , when i was a teenager ... you couldn' t get me out of my shell for nothin ' .
i had this high , squeaky voice ... and these itty bitty little pincers .
and then one day , boom !
i sound like caruso ... and these whoppers pop out !
young lady , just where do you think you' re going ?
i' ve gotta figure this out .
this necklace means something ... and if no one' s gonna tell me ...
i' m gonna find out myself .
melody , please !
you' re making a big mistake !
oh , this is delicious .
this is divine !
let' s go , flatsos .
hurry , undertow .
there' s a little girl out there who needs our help .
all right , sebastian , you must remain calm .
this is not your fault .
all you have to do is go in there and calmly explain ... that melody has run away .
no reason to lose your head .
whatever you do ... you absitively , positutely ... must not panic .
melody !
melody' s gone !
melody' s gone !
melody' s gone !
sebastian ?
well , what are you doing here ?
all my fault !
i tried to stop her !
i don' t deserve to live !
gone ?
gone where ?
out .
out to the sea .
what do you mean ?
where could she be going ?
to morgana' s .
and she can tell me what this locket means , why it has my name on it ?
oh , sure , kid .
morgana' s the best .
she' il help ya .
okay .
then let' s go .
angel face , meet the one and only ...
morgana .
oh , welcome , my precious .
oh , don' t be shy .
come in .
come in out of the cold .
sit , sit .
put your feet up .
hungry ?
afraid all i have is a cold plate .
smelt cicle ?
kelp chip ?
hush guppy ?
uh , no , thank you .
i was hoping you could tell me about this pendant ... why it has my name on it .
my mother wouldn' t tell me .
she just doesn' t understand .
oh , you' re not the only one with a mother who doesn' t understand you .
believe me , i know just how you feel .
dear child , did you ever consider ... that it has your name on it ... because it has your destiny in it ?
oh , deep down ... you know you weren' t meant to be a lowly human .
what you are is something ... far more enchanting .
a mermaid ?
but it' s not possible .
darling , anything' s possible .
you can turn me into a mermaid ?
piece of fish cake , honey .
lots of luck .
ursula' s magic ?
where' d you get that ?
i' ve been saving it for a special occasion .
one drop of this and , bada bing , bada boom !
you' re in fin city !
whee !
really ?
come , my darling .
your destiny awaits you .
i don' t believe it !
i' m a mermaid .
say it loud , say it proud !
i' m a mermaid !
you had this all along .
you coulda changed me back .
why , i oughta
keep your scales on , small fry .
i' m still reeling her in .
oh , daddy , i' m so worried .
everything' s going to be all right , ariel .
we have search parties scouring the ocean .
i' m going to join them now myself .
ariel , maybe you should go with him .
but , eric
i need to stay here and lead the search on land .
but you know these waters ... and you know our daughter .
you have to go .
it may be dangerous .
eric' s right , daddy .
i should have known i couldn' t keep melody from the sea .
it' s a part of her .
and a part of me .
i have to go .
bring her home .
what a totally cool feeling !
oh , excuse me .
i' m so sorry , ma' am .
okay , get a grip get the hang of this flipper
it' s like slipping two feet into one big , huge slipper
this way is left which way is right
oh , now i' il be circling in circles all night
oh , so this is forward no problem
i can' t believe i can do this and more
to swim in the sea like i walk on the shore
out of my shell not closed up like a clam
look out , sea this is me
here lam
for a moment all of me
ls alive andat home in these a
i' m swirling and twirling so graceful and grand
not stubbing my toes getting stuckin the sand
fora moment life is cool
i' m a splash in the world' s biggest pool
this is more than my thoughts ever thought it could be
for a moment just a moment
lucky me
lf only for one moment
i had shared with you all i know
these a wouldn' t be a mystery
oh , why did you have to go
everything' s newer and brighter and bluer
and truer to life than before
watch me soar
for a moment i can shine
got again and a fin that works fine
my fingers are wrinkly and really don' t care
i fall of my curls have curled out of my hair
for a moment i can feel
all the dreams i' ve been dreaming are real
wish my mother could hear it
these a is my song
fora moment just a moment
i be long i will find you , my darling
and the moment that i do
i' il hold you close my melody
and sing the song of the sea
with you
sing the song of the sea for a moment , just a moment
with you i belong
oh , thank you !
thank you so much !
oh !
what' s the matter ?
oh , i knew this would happen .
one taste , and you' re hooked .
oh , undertow , i' m such a failure , such a
oh , my precious ... there wasn' t enough potion for this to be a forever spell .
please .
i i don' t want to go back to being an ordinary girl .
isn' t there some way i can stay a mermaid ?
oh , i' m afraid there' s absolutely no possible way .
well , there is one way .
no .
what am i thinking ?
it' s far too dangerous .
what ?
wh what' s too dangerous ?
well , i could make the spell last longer ... if i had my magic trident .
oh , but it was stolen years ago ... by a deranged kleptomaniac ... and there' s no one to get it back for me .
maybe i could get it back for you .
you would do that for me ?
if i did , would you make me a mermaid forever ?
even longer , if you like .
now , here is where the scoundrel lives .
atlantica ?
you mean it' s notjust an old fish tale ?
it really exists ?
ofcourse it exists , dear .
whoever told you otherwise ?
my mother .
well , i' m sure she didn' t mean to be cruel and deceitful .
okay , i' il bring back your trident .

i just want you to know , pal ...
i' m sorry i said that thing about the blubber .

morgana .
if she gets her hands on my trident
double the search parties !
i want every creature in the ocean on patrol !
yes , sire !
wait a minute .
i know those two .
it' s all my fault .
if i had just paid a little more attention ... instead of blabbering on and on and on ...
and on and on .
from now on , your majesty , nothing gets past
me .
we did it !
all this time ...
atlantica was never that far away from home .
this is your home ?
it used to be .
whoa !
what a pad !
talk about your kerb appeal .
but , uh , what' s with the wall ?
i know good fences make good neighbours , but isn' t that a bit much ?
yeah .
what you tryin ' to keep out ?
it wasn' t built to keep something out .
it was built to keep me in .
come on .
let' s go .
you know , kid , the three of us , we make a pretty good team .
once you' re a permanent mermaid , we' il be friends forever .
we' il be inseparable !
nothing will ever come between us .
shark !

it' s just
leavin ' so soon , boys ?

you wanna be a mermaid , or what ?
we got the power .

so there it is .
swim back as fast as you can and tell my father .
i' il try to find melody .
oh , but if that old sea witch is in there , and then there' s that mean little shark ... and then those manta rays come , a and then she takes those those creepy tentacles ... so suction cups stick to your face , and , and
uh .
uh uh .
no way you' re goin ' in there alone .
but , flounder , if we both go ... who' s going to tell daddy where morgana' s lair is ?
say , what' s all the whisperin ' about ?
is melody around here ?
did you find her yet ?
if she' s  scuttle !
get down and be quiet .
wait a minute .
scuttle can get help .
scuttle , i need you to pay very close attention .
we' re doomed .
oh , there you are , darling !
oh , i was so worried about you .
and look !

sweetheart , hand me my trident now .
all this time , and you never told me ?

please , give it to me , melody .
no .
hand it to me .
it' s for your own good .
she' s lying !
i' ve given you what you' ve always wanted .
she' s the one who lied to you all these years .
i was trying to protect you .
by fencing me in ?
you knew how much i loved the sea .
why did you keep the truth from me ?
melody , listen to me .
if there was one thing in my life that i could do over , i
too late , mom .
melody , no !
all the power of the seven seas at my command !
hello !
can we get with the programme ?
it' s still a small world down here !
mom !
your mommy was only trying to protect you from moi !
what she did , she did out of ...
love .
little melody' s been a very naughty girl ... stealing from her own grandfather .
my my grandfather ?
king triton , ruler of atlantica ... commander in chief of all of the oceans !
or at least he was , until a certain little thief came along .
you tricked me .
you' ve got no one to blame but yourself .
tell me , melody .
is being a mermaid everything you dreamed ?
was it worth it ?
melody !
oh , and by the way ... your time as a mermaid has just about expired .
catch you later .
i' ve got bigger fish to fry !
bigger fish !
now , there' s an idea !
we gotta keep trying .
it' s no use .
it' s too thick .
oh , flounder .
i' ve ruined everything .
we' re guppies , man .
jellyfish .
the great tip and dash .
cowards slash losers .
well , at least we' re alive .
yeah , if you wanna call this living .
okay , on the one hand we can live a long , healthy life ... albeit as disgusting , pathetic , cowardly
worms .
that' s good .
good .
cowardly worms .
on the other hand , we could gather our courage , if we had any ... and storm the fortress and be heroes .
yeah , until they hack us up into fish bait .
you' re right .
melody' s in there .
she could be in big trouble .
she may really need our help !
so what' s it gonna be ?
a lifetime as worms ... or two minutes as heroes ?
all hail queen morgana !
i' m hailin ' !
i' m hailin ' !

king triton ?

and all the creatures of the sea are in my power !
i' m the queen of the sea ...
and you will bow down before me !
oh , this can' t be good for the lower back !
pathetic fools !
watch and see how utterly powerful i can be !
mom !
the end begins for all of you with fins !
that' s it , triton .
bow down !

i' m sorry , sebastian .
i have no choice .
oh !
wishes do come true .

i sentence you to oblivion !
you !
just what do you think you' re going to do ... with that ?

never again will you or yours threaten my family !
there will be no escape for you ... ever !
mommy .
dad ?
oh , melody , i was so afraid we' d lost you .
i' m sorry , mother .
oh , no , sweetie .
we' re sorry .
we should have told you the truth .
i didn' t mean to hurt anyone .
i just hoped i' d be a better mermaid than a girl .
oh , melody , sweetie , it doesn' t matter if you have fins or feet .
we love you for who you are on the inside : our very brave little girl .
just like your mother .
oh , grandfather !
melody , i don' t blame you for wanting to join us merfolk .
and because you' re my granddaughter ...
i' m giving you a most precious gift : a choice .
you can come to atlantica with me ... or you can return to your home on land .
it' s up to you .
i have a better idea .
