s " , i killed you , mozart .
mozart , " piet " !
forgive your assassin !
forgive me , mozart !
signore salieri , open the door , be good now !
signore " , we have something special for you .
something you' re going to love .
is that good !
signore " , believe me ... ... this is the most delicious thing i ever ate in my life !
really , you don' t know what you' re miss ...
all right , that' s enough !
open the door .
signore " , if you don' t open this door ... ... we' re gonna leave nothing for you .
and i' m never gonna come see you again !
good morning , father .
herr salieri ?
leave me alone .
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain .
do you know who i am ?
that makes no difference .
all men are equal in god' s eyes .
are they ?
offer me your confession .
i can offer you god' s forgiveness .
how well are you trained in music ?
i know a little .
i studied it in my youth .
where ?
here in vienna .
then you must know this .
i can' t say that i do .
what is it ?
it was a very popular tune in its day .
i wrote it .
here , how about this ?
this one brought down the house when we played it .
well ?
i regret it is not too familiar .
can you recall no melody of mine ?
i was the most famous composer in europe .
i wrote 40 operas alone .
here !
what about this one ?
yes , i know that !
that' s charming !
i' m sorry , i didn' t know you wrote that .
i didn' t .
that was mozart .
wolfgang ... ... amadeus mozart .
the man you accuse yourself of killing .
you' ve heard that ?
is it true ?
for god' s sake , my son ... ... if you have something to confess , do it now .
give yourself some peace .
he ... ... was my idol .
mozart .
i can' t think of a time when i didn' t know his name .
i was playing games ... ... when he was playing music for kings and emperors .
even the pope in rome .
i admit , i was jealous ... ... when i heard the tales they told about him .
not of the brilliant little prodigy ... ... but of his father , who had taught him everything .
my father , he did not care for music .
when i told him ... ... how i wished i could be like mozart ... ... he would say , " why ?
do you want to be a trained monkey ?
you' d like me to drag you around , doing tricks like a circus freak ?
how could i tell him ... ... what music meant to me ?
while my father prayed earnestly to god ... ... to protect commerce ... ...
i would offer up ... ... secretly ... ... the proudest prayer a boy could think of .
lord , make me a great composer .
let me celebrate your glory through music ... ... and be celebrated myself .
make me famous through the world .
make me immortal .
after i die ... ... let people speak my name with love for what i wrote .
in return ... ... i will give you my chastity ... ... my industry ... ... my deepest humility , every hour of my life .
amen .
and do you know what happened ?
a miracle !
my life changed forever .
i knew god had arranged it all .
that was obvious .
one minute i was a frustrated boy ... ... in an obscure little town .
the next i was here ... ... in vienna , city of musicians ... ... and emperor joseph , the musical king .
in a few years , i was his court composer .
isn' t that incredible ?
every night i sat with the emperor of austria ... ... playing duets with him ... ... correcting the royal sight reading .
actually , the man had no ear at all .
but what did it matter ?
he adored my music .
tell me ...
if you had been me ... ... wouldn' t you have thought god had accepted your vow ?
and believe me , i honored it .
i was a model of virtue .
i kept my hands off women .
i worked hours every day teaching students , many for free !
sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians .
work , that was all my life .
and it was wonderful .
everybody liked me .
i liked myself .
until he came .
he came to vienna to play some of his music ... ... at the residence of the prince archbishop of salzburg .
eagerly , i went there to seek him out .
that night ... ... changed my life .
as i wandered through the salon ... ...
i played a little game with myself .
this man had written his first concerto at the age of 4 ... ... his first symphony at 7 , a full scale opera at 12 !
did it show ?
is talent like that ... ... written on the face ?
which one of them ... ... could he be ?
mozart is not here .
stop it !
i am .
stop it !
i am stopping it .
i am !
i' m stopping it .
slowly .
there .
you see ?
i' ve stopped .
now we' re going back .
no !
yes !
you don' t know where you are .
here , everything goes backwards .
people walk and dance and sing and even talk backwards .
that' s stupid .
why ?
people fart backwards .
ssa ym ssik !
ssa ym ssik !
yes , you are .
you are very sick .
no !
say it backwards , shitwit !
ssa ym ssik .
ssik , kiss .
ym , my .
ssa .
kiss my ass .
em yrram !
i' m not playing !
say it , it' s serious .
it' s very serious .
yrram .
marry me .
i' m not gonna marry you .
you' re a fiend .
uoy evol i tub .
tub .
but i ... ... love ...
but i love you ?
tihs ym tae .
what ?
eat .
eat .
ym , my .
my .
tihs .
eat my shit .
you filthy fiend !
you filthy ... !
my music .
they' ve started without me .
that was mozart !
that giggling , dirty creature i' d just seen crawling on the floor .
i think that went well , don' t you ?
indeed .
the viennese know good music , don' t you think ?
certainly .
your grace .
ah , mozart .
why ?
why what , sir ?
why do i have to be humiliated in front of my guests ... ... by one of my own servants ?
the more license i allow you , the more you take .
if his grace is not satisfied , he can dismiss me .
i wish you to return immediately to salzburg .
your father is waiting for you there .
no , your grace !
i would prefer you dismissed me .
it' s obvious i don' t satisfy .
i have no intention of dismissing you .
you will remain in my service ... ... and learn your place .
on the page it looked ...
nothing !
the beginning simple , almost comic .
just a pulse .
bassoons , basset horns ... ... like a rusty squeezebox .
and then , suddenly ... ... high above it ... ... an oboe .
a single note , hanging there , unwavering .
until ... ... a clarinet took it over ... ... sweetened it into a phrase of such delight .
this was no composition by a performing monkey .
this was a music i had never heard .
filled with such longing , such unfulfillable longing .
it seemed to me i was hearing the voice of god .
excuse me .
but why ?
why would god choose an obscene child to be his instrument ?
it was not to be believed .
this piece had to be an accident .
it had to be .
it better be .
how good is he , this mozart ?
he' s remarkable , majesty .
i heard an extraordinary opera of his last month .
idomeneo , king of crete .
that ?
a tiresome piece .
i heard it too .
tiresome ?
a young man trying to impress beyond his abilities .
too much spice .
too many notes .
majesty ... ... it was the most promising work i' ve heard in years .
then , we should make some effort to acquire him .
we could use a good german composer in vienna , surely ?
i' m sure he could be tempted with the right offer .
say ... ... an opera in german for our national theater .
excellent , sire !
but not german .
i beg , your majesty .
italian is the proper language for opera .
all educated people agree on that .
what do you think , chamberlain ?
in my opinion , it' s time we had a piece in our own language .
plain german for plain people .
kapellmeister ?
majesty ... ... i must agree with " herr direttore " .
german is ... ... too brute for singing .
court composer ... ... what do you think ?
i think it' s an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna .
it should infuriate the archbishop ... ... if that is your majesty' s intention .
you are " cattivo " , court composer .
i want to meet this young man .
arrange a pleasant welcome for him .
well , there it is !
this is a beautiful wig for you .
it looks so marvelous and i love it .
the other one .
here is the other one .
i think you will love it .
here' s the third one .
so ?
here we go .
how do you like it ?
they' re all so beautiful !
why don' t i have three heads ?
this is funny !
three heads !
gentlemen .
good morning .
morning , your majesty .
what do you have for me today ?
your majesty , " herr mozart " .
yes , what about him ?
he' s here .
well , there it is .
good !
i hope you won' t find it improper , but i' ve written a march in his honor .
what a charming idea , court composer .
may i see ?
just a ...
just a trifle , of course .
may i try it ?
let' s have some fun .
delightful , court composer !
may i play it when he comes in ?
you do me too much honor .
bring in " herr mozart " .
but slowly .
i need a minute to practice .
good , continue .
g , majesty .
excellent !
good , majesty .
continue .
very good .
very good , majesty .
tempo !
up .
lightly , then strongly !
it' s a march , majesty .
again .
bravo , majesty !
gentlemen , please .
a little less enthusiasm , i beg you .
no , please .
it' s not a holy relic .
you know , we have met before .
in this very room .
you don' t recall .
you were only 6 .
he was giving a delightful concert !
as he got off the stool , he fell .
my sister antoinette helped him up .
know what he did ?
he jumped into her arms and said , " will you marry me ?
yes or no ?
you know all these gentlemen .
the baron van swieten .
i' m a great admirer of yours .
thank you .
kapellmeister bonno .
my pleasure .
the director of opera , count orsini rosenberg .
sir , yes .
the honor is mine , absolutely !
here is our illustrious court composer ... ... maestro salieri .
at last , such immense joy !
i know your work well .
you know , i composed some variations on a melody of yours .
really ?
which one ?
" mio caro adone .
i' m flattered .
a funny tune , but it yielded good things .
and now he has returned the compliment .
herr salieri " composed this little march for you .
really ?
well , there it is .
down to business .
we' re going to commission an opera from you .
what do you say ?
did we vote in the end for german or italian ?
sire , if you remember , we did finally incline to italian .
did we ?
i don' t think it was really decided , your majesty .
german .
please let it be german .
why so ?
because i' ve already found the most wonderful libretto .
have i seen it ?
i don' t think you have , " herr direktor " .
it' s quite new .
i' il show it to you immediately .
i think you' d better .
well ... ... tell us about it .
tell us the story .
well , it' s quite amusing , majesty .
it' s set ...
the whole thing is set in a ...
yes ?
where ?
in a harem , majesty .
in a seraglio .
you mean in turkey ?
yes , exactly .
then why especially does it have to be in german ?
it doesn' t , especially .
it could be in turkish if you really want .
no , my dear fellow , the language is not finally the point .
do you really think that subject is appropriate for a national theater ?
why not ?
it' s charming .
i mean , i won' t actually show concubines exposing their ...
it' s not indecent .
it' s highly moral , majesty .
it' s full of proper german virtues .
excuse me , majesty , but what do you think these could be ?
being a foreigner , i' d love to learn .
well , tell him , mozart .
name us a german virtue .
love , sire .
oh , love !
of course , in italy we know nothing about love .
no , i don' t think you do .
watching italian opera , all those male sopranos screeching ... ... stupid , fat couples rolling their eyes about .
that' s not love .
it' s rubbish !
majesty , you choose the language .
i' il set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch .
well , there it is .
let it be german .
this is yours .
keep it .
it' s already here in my head .
what ?
on one hearing only ?
i think so , sire .
yes .
show us .
the rest is just the same , isn' t it ?
that doesn' t really work , does it ?
did you try ... ?
shouldn' t it be a bit more ... ?
or this ?
this .
yes .
better ?
what do you think ?
grazie , signore .
all i ever wanted was to sing to god .
he gave me that longing ... ... and then made me mute .
why ?
tell me that .
if he didn' t want me to praise him with music ... ... why implant the desire ... ... like a lust in my body ?
and then deny me the talent ?
madame cavalieri is here for her lesson , sir .
maestro .
well ... ?
how do you like it ?
it' s turkish .
my hairdresser said everything this year' s going to be turkish .
does he ?
what else did he tell you today ?
come , come !
give me some gossip .
well , i heard you met " herr mozart " .
news travels fast in vienna .
and he' s been commissioned to write an opera .
is it true ?
yes .
is there a part in it for me ?
no .
how do you know ?
do you know where it' s set , my dear ?
where ?
in a harem .
what' s that ?
a brothel .
come .
let' s begin .
what does he look like ?
mozart ?
you might be disappointed .
why ?
looks and talent don' t always go together , katerina .
looks don' t concern me , maestro .
only talent interests a woman of taste .
shall we continue ?
there she was .
i don' t know where they met or how .
there she stood !
on stage , for all to see .
showing off like the greedy songbird she was .
ten minutes of ghastly scales .
arpeggios !
whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground .
understand , i was in love with the girl .
or at least in lust .
and i swear to you , i never laid a finger on her .
all the same , i couldn' t bear to think of anyone else touching her .
least of all , " the creature " .
brava , madame !
you are an ornament to our stage .
your majesty .
well , " herr mozart " .
a good effort .
well , decidedly that .
an excellent effort !
you have shown us something ... ... quite new tonight .
it is new .
it is , isn' t it , sire ?
yes , indeed .
so then , you liked it ?
you really liked it , sire ?
well , of course i did !
it' s very good !
of course , now and then , just now and then ... ... it seemed a touch ...
what do you mean , sire ?
well , i mean , occasionally , it seems to have ...
how shall one say ... ?
how shall one say , " direktor " ?
too many notes , majesty ?
exactly .
very well put .
too many notes .
i don' t understand .
there are just as many notes as i required , neither more nor less .
my dear fellow , there are in fact ... ... only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening .
i think i' m right in saying that , aren' t i , court composer ?
yes .
on the whole , yes , majesty .
this is absurd !
young man , don' t take it too hard .
your work is ingenious .
it' s quality work .
and there are simply too many notes .
just cut a few and it' il be perfect .
which few did you have in mind ?
wolfgang !
wolfgang , my dear !
wolfgang !
majesty , this is " frau weber " .
she' s my landlady .
enchanted , madame .
sire , such an honor !
this is my dear daughter , constanze .
she' s the fiance of " herr mozart " .
really ?
how charming .
please .
well ... ... when do you marry ?
we haven' t exactly received my father' s consent yet .
not entirely .
not altogether .
excuse me , but how old are you ?
26 .
my advice is for you to marry this charming young lady ... ... and stay with us in vienna .
you see ?
i told him that , but he won' t listen to me .
your majesty , you give such wonderful ... ... such royal advice .
may i ... ?
well , there it is .
wolfie , will you get some water ?
will you get some water , please ?
wolfie , get some water !
excuse me .
excuse me .
did you know ?
what ?
the marriage .
what does it matter to you ?
nothing .
he can marry who he pleases , i don' t give a damn .
how was i ?
you were sublime .
and what did you think of the music ?
extremely clever .
katerina , i ...
excuse me .
is that woman still lying on the floor ?
no , she' s fine .
oh , i' m so relieved .
dear mozart , my sincere congratulations .
did you like it then ?
how could i not ?
it' s the best music in vienna today , don' t you agree ?
she must be dazzling in bed .
i assume she' s the virtuoso in that department .
no other reason why you' d marry someone like that .
come in .
excuse me .
wolfie , mom isn' t feeling very well .
can we go home ?
yes .
no , no , no .
you can' t take him away now .
this is his night .
won' t you introduce us , wolfgang ?
excuse us , " frulein " .
good night , " signore " .
at that moment i knew , beyond any doubt ... ... he' d had her .
the creature had had my darling girl .
it was incomprehensible !
what was god up to ?
was it possible i was being tested ?
was god expecting me to offer forgiveness ... ... in the face of every offense ?
no matter how painful ?
it' s very possible .
but why him ?
why choose mozart to teach me lessons in humility ?
my heart was filling up ... ... with such hatred for that little man .
for the first time in my life , i began to know ... ... really ... ... violent thoughts .
every day , sometimes for hours , i would pray .
lord ... ... please ... ... send him away ... ... back to salzburg .
for his sake ... ... as well as mine .
no !
i won' t have him back .
but , your grace ...
your son is an unprincipled , spoiled , conceited brat !
yes , sir ... ... that is the truth .
but don' t blame him .
the fault is mine , entirely .
i was too indulgent with him .
please , your grace ?
give him one more chance ?
you have leave to try .
god bless , your grace !
i thank your grace .
i thank you !
i write to you with urgent news .
i' m coming to vienna .
take no further steps towards marriage until we meet .
as you honor the father who has devoted his life to yours ... ... do as i bid , and await my coming .
i now join you in the holy bonds of matrimony .
those whom god hath joined together ... ... let no man put asunder .
you say vienna is the musicians ' city .
to conquer here is to conquer europe .
with my wife i can do it .
one day , when i' m wealthy ... ... you' il live with us , and we' il be so happy .
good morning .
this is my niece , princess elizabeth .
your highness .
she' s asked me to recommend a music instructor .
i' ve come up with an excellent idea .
your majesty !
it would be such a tremendous honor !
i was thinking of " herr mozart " .
what is your view ?
it' s an interesting idea , majesty , but ...
yes ?
my concern is to protect you ... ... from any hint of favoritism .
favoritism .
what is this ?
what is what ?
why must i submit samples of my work to a committee to teach a girl ?
because his majesty wishes it .
is the emperor angry with me ?
quite the contrary .
then why not appoint me to the post ?
you are not the only composer in vienna .
no .
but i' m the best .
mozart .
a little modesty might suit you better .
who is on this committee ?
kapellmeister bonno , count orsini rosenberg and salieri .
naturally , the italians !
of course , always the italians !
they' re all musical idiots !
and you want them to judge my music ?
young man ... ... the issue is quite simple .
if you want this position ... ... you must submit your stuff , along with all your colleagues .
must i ?
well , i won' t .
how are we supposed to live ?
do you want me to beg on the streets ?
don' t be stupid .
all they want to see is your work .
shit .
what' s wrong with that ?
shut up !
just shut up .
one royal pupil , and all of vienna will come flocking .
they' il come anyway .
no , they won' t .
they love me here .
i know how things work in this city .
you know everything , don' t you ?
yes ?
excuse me , sir .
a lady insists on talking to you .
who ?
she didn' t say , but she says it' s urgent .
excuse me , my dear .
your excellency .
how can i help you ?
frau mozart ?
i' ve come on behalf of my husband .
i brought samples of his work so he can be considered for the appointment .
how charming , but why did he not come himself ?
well , he' s terribly busy , sir .
i understand .
i will look at them the moment i can .
it will be an honor .
please give him my warmest regards .
would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now ?
while i wait .
i' m afraid i' m not at leisure ... ... this precise moment .
leave them with me .
i assure you , they will be safe .
i really cannot do that , sir .
you see , he doesn' t know i' m here .
then he didn' t send you ?
no , sir .
this was my own idea .
i see .
sir , we' re desperate .
we really need this job .
my husband spends far more than he can ever earn .
i don' t mean that he' s lazy , because he works all day long .
it' s just that he' s not practical .
money simply slips through his fingers .
it' s ridiculous .
let me offer you some refreshment .
do you know what these are ?
capezzoli di venere " !
nipples of venus .
they' re roman chestnuts in brandied sugar .
try one .
go on , try one !
they' re quite surprising .
they' re wonderful !
thank you very much , your excellency .
don' t keep calling me that .
keeps me at such a distance .
i wasn' t born a court composer , you know .
i' m from a small town .
just like your husband .
are you sure you can' t ... ... leave this and come back again ?
it' s very tempting , sir .
but it' s impossible , i' m afraid .
he' d be frantic if he knew they were missing .
you see , they' re all originals .
originals ?
yes , sir .
he doesn' t make copies .
these ... ... are originals ?
astounding !
it was actually ...
it was beyond belief .
these were first and only ... ... drafts of music .
but they showed no corrections of any kind .
not one .
he had simply written down music ... ... already finished in his head .
page after page of it .
as if he were just taking dictation .
and music ... ... finished as no music is ever finished .
displace one note ... ... and there would be diminishment .
displace one phrase , and the structure would fall .
it was clear to me ... ... that sound i had heard in the archbishop' s palace ... ... had been no accident .
here again was the very voice of god .
i was staring through the cage ... ... of those meticulous ink strokes ... ... at an absolute beauty .
is it not good ?
it is miraculous .
yes , he' s very proud of his work .
so you will help us ?
i dine with the emperor tomorrow evening .
one word from me and the post is his .
thank you , your excellency !
thank you !
come back tonight .
tonight ?
alone .
what for ?
some service deserves service in return .
no ?
what do you mean ?
isn' t it obvious ?
it' s a post all vienna seeks .
if you wish it for your husband , come tonight .
i' m a married woman , sir .
then don' t .
it' s up to you .
and not to be vague , that is the price .
there is no god of mercy , father .
just a god of torture .
evening came .
i sat there , not knowing whether she would return or not .
i prayed as i had never prayed before .
dear god ... ... enter me now .
fill me with one piece of true music .
one piece with your breath in it , so i know that you love me .
show me one sign of your favor , and i will show mine to mozart .
i will get him the royal position .
enter me .
please .
please !
yes ?
that lady is back , sir .
show her in .
well ?
i' m here .
my husband has gone to a concert .
he didn' t think i would enjoy it .
well , where shall we go ?
should we stay here ?
well ...
do you still want to look at these ?
or don' t we need to bother anymore ?
suppose we don' t , really .
show this woman out .
stanzi .
stanzi .
what is it ?
what' s the matter ?
tell me .
tell me .
i love you .
i love you .
from now on , we are enemies .
you and i.
because you choose for your instrument ... ... a boastful , lustful , smutty , infantile boy ... ... and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the incarnation .
because you are unjust ... ... unfair ... ... unkind ... ...
i will block you .
i swear it .
i will hinder and harm your creature on earth ... ... as far as i am able .
i don' t like to talk against a fellow musician .
of course not .
i have to tell you .
mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies .
really ?
one of my own pupils , a very young singer ... ... maria theresa paradis ... ... told me she was ...
well ...
well , what ?
molested , majesty .
twice , in the course of the same lesson .
there is a " herr mozart " waiting for you in the salon .
whom did they choose ?
herr zummer .
herr zummer ?
but the man' s a fool !
he' s a total mediocrity .
no , no .
he has yet to achieve mediocrity .
i can' t lose this post .
i simply can' t .
excellency , please .
let' s go to the palace .
you can talk to the emperor ... ... and tell him that " herr zummer " is an awful choice .
he could do musical harm to the princess .
between us , no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess .
look ... ... i must have pupils .
without pupils , i can' t manage .
you don' t mean you' re living in poverty ?
no , but i' m broke .
well , how is this possible ?
i hear your concerts are quite successful .
they' re stupendously successful .
you can' t get a seat .
but no one will hire me .
they want to hear me play ... ... but they won' t let me teach their daughters , as if i was a fiend .
seriously ... ... is there any chance you could manage a loan ?
only for six months .
eight , at the most .
you expect your fortunes to change in six or eight months ?
as a matter of fact , i do .
i am working on something that will explode like a bomb all over europe .
i' il be the richest man in vienna .
i' il pay you back double .
anything .
you name the terms .
well , how exciting .
tell me more .
it' s a bit of a secret .
come , come .
i' m interested .
this is delicious .
what is it ?
it' s cream cheese mixed with sugar ... ... suffused with rum .
crema mascarpone speciale .
italian .
forgive me .
we all have patriotic feelings of some kind .
two thou ...
two hundred florins .
that' s all i need .
a hundred .
fifty .
what exactly are you working on ?
really , i can' t say .
i don' t think you should become known in vienna as a debtor , mozart .
however ... ... i know a distinguished gentleman i can recommend , and ... ... he has a daughter .
quiet !
quiet !
herr mozart .
welcome .
pay no attention , they' re impossible .
i treat them just like my own children .
which of them do you wish me to teach ?
that' s funny .
you' re a funny fellow .
this is the instrument .
i hope it' s to your satisfaction .
of course it' il be to his satisfaction .
come , we' re going to listen to some music .
come !
good boy .
now .
please play me something , just to give me an idea .
anything will do .
just go ahead .
just as if we weren' t here .
part of music , getting used to an audience .
right , " herr mozart " ?
perhaps it would be better if we were left alone .
we' re both a little shy .
play .
i said play !
michael , please .
perhaps if i play first , it might encourage the " frulein " .
why don' t you let me try ?
stop it !
stop !
he always howls when he hears music .
we' ve got to break him of that habit .
we' ve got to break them of their habit !
play .

herr mozart " , play .

couldn' t be better .
that' s not what i hear .
what do you mean ?
it' s wonderful .
really , it' s marvelous !
people love me here .
they say you have debts .
who ?
who says that ?
that' s a malicious lie !
do you have pupils ?
i don' t want pupils !
they get in the way .
i have to have time for composition .
composition doesn' t pay .
you know that .
that one will .
what' s that ?
it' s a secret .
secret ?
you don' t have secrets from me .
no !
please !
i don' t want you to see it .
i don' t want anyone to see it .
you' il be so proud of me .
it' il be the best thing i' ve ever done .
the best thing anyone ...
there she is !
look at her !
isn' t she beautiful ?
now , papa , confess it .
could you want a prettier daughter ?
stop it , wolfie !
i look dreadful .
are you ... ... expecting ?
yes , i am .
isn' t it marvelous ?
we' re delighted .
may i offer you some tea ?
who wants tea ?
let' s go out !
this calls for a feast .
you don' t want tea , do you ?
i know !
let' s go dancing .
papa loves parties , don' t you ?
how can you be so boring ?
tea !
come on , papa .
hurry !
here we go .
good day .

i name the penalty !
i name the penalty !
and the penalty is ...

show us your legs !
come on , come on !
it' s just a game , papa .
thank you .
herr mozart " , why don' t you name your son' s penalty ? !
yes , papa .
name it .
name it .
i' il do anything you say .
anything .
i want you to come back to salzburg with me .
the penalty must be performed in the room .
i' m tired of this game .
but my penalty !
i' ve got to have a penalty !
i name a penalty !
the penalty is ... ... you shall play our tune ... ... in the manner of johann sebastian bach !
turn him over !
over ? !
now you play it backwards !
another one !
give me another one !
play it like gluck !
boring .
another !
handel !
i don' t like him !
another one !
play salieri .
now that is a challenge !
that is a challenge .
please !
please !
go on .
mock me .
laugh !
that was not mozart laughing , father .
that was god .
that was god laughing at me through that obscene giggle .
go on , " signore " .
laugh .
show my mediocrity for all to see .
one day i will laugh at you .
before i leave this earth ... ... i will laugh at you .
wolfie ?
what ?
there' s a young girl here to see you .
what does she want ?
she won' t talk to me .
she says she has to speak to you .
damn .
yes ?
are you " herr mozart " ?
that' s right .
my name is lorl , sir .
i' m a maidservant .
i was asked to come here and offer my services to you .
they' il be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain ... ... anonymous .
is this your idea , papa ?
mine ?
are you playing a trick on me ?
i' ve never seen this girl .
is this some kind of joke ?
not at all , sir .
young woman , this won' t do .
my son can' t accept such an offer , no matter how generous ... ... unless he knows who' s behind it .
i can' t tell you that , sir .
this is ridiculous !
what is ridiculous ?
wolfie has many admirers in vienna .
people send us gifts all the time .
you cannot accept her without references .
well , this is none of your business .
whoever sent you is going to pay ?
that' s right .
splendid !
now we' re going to let a stranger into our house .
who is we ?
who is letting who ... ?
could you please wait outside ?
yes , ma' am .
look , old man !
we spend a fortune on you , and all you can do is criticize .
and now ...
stanzi !
no !
it' s right that he should hear !
i' m sick to death of it .
we can' t do anything right for you , can we ?
you won' t have to do anything for me ever again .
i' m leaving .
no , papa .
i won' t stay and be a burden .
no one calls you that .
she does .
she says i sleep all day .
and so you do !
the only time you come out is to eat .
well , what do you expect ?
do you expect anyone to walk out into a mess like this every day ?
so now i' m a bad housekeeper !
so you are .
it' s a pigsty .
when can you start ?
right away , ma' am .
good .
they' re out every night , sir .
thank you , sir .
do any pupils come to the house ?
not that i' ve seen .
then how does he pay for all this ?
does he work at all ?
yes , sir .
all day long .
he never leaves the house till evening .
he just sits there , writing and writing .
really ?
what is it he' s writing ?
i wouldn' t know that , sir .
of course not .
you' re a good girl .
you' re very kind to do this .
the next time you' re sure they' il be out of the house , let me know .
thank you , sir .
i think i found out about the money , sir .
yes ?
what ?
he kept seven snuffboxes in here .
i could swear they were all gold .
and now look .
there' s only one left .
where does he work ?
in there , sir .
gentlemen , i' ve just heard some news ... ... that may interest you .
what ?
mozart is writing a new opera .
an italian opera .
italian ?
that' s not all .
he has chosen for his subject , figaro .
the marriage of figaro .
he' s setting that play to music ?
yes .
what is this " marriage of figaro " ?
it' s a french play , kapellmeister .
it has been banned by the emperor .
you' re absolutely sure ?
herr mozart .
gentlemen , sit down .
mozart .
are you aware that i have declared the french play " figaro " ... ... unsuitable for our theater ?
yes , sire .
yet we hear you' re making an opera from it .
is this true ?
who told you this , majesty ?
it is not your place to ask questions .
is it true ?
yes , i ...
i admit it is .
would you tell me why ?
majesty , it is only a comedy .
what you think is scarcely the point .
it' s what his majesty thinks that counts .
but , your majesty ...
mozart ... ... i am a tolerant man .
i do not censor things lightly .
when i do , i have good reason .
figaro " is a bad play .
it stirs up hatred between classes .
in france , it has caused only bitterness .
my sister antoinette is beginning to be frightened of her own people .
i swear , there' s nothing like that in the piece .
i' ve taken out everything that could give offense .
i hate politics .
i' m afraid you' re rather innocent .
in these dangerous times i cannot afford to provoke our people ... ... simply over a theater piece .
majesty , this is just a frolic .
a piece about love .
love " .
again !
and it' s new !
it' s entirely new .
the people will go mad for it .
i have scenes ...
the end of act il , for example .
it starts as a duet .
a husband and wife quarreling .
suddenly , the scheming maid comes in .
it' s a very funny situation .
duet turns into trio .
then the husband' s valet comes in .
trio turns into quartet .
then a gardener .
quartet becomes quintet .
and so on , on and on .
sextet , septet , octet .
how long do you think i can sustain that ?
i have no idea .
guess .
guess , your majesty .
imagine the longest time it could be sustained , then double it .
well ...
six ... ... seven minutes ?
eight minutes ?
twenty , sire .
twenty minutes !
twenty minutes of continuous music .
no recitatives !
sire , only opera can do this .
in a play , if more than one person speaks at once ... ... it' s just noise .
but with opera , with music ... ... you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time .
it' s not noise .
it' s a perfect harmony !
mozart , music is not the issue here .
no one doubts your talent .
it' s your literary judgment that' s in question .
even with the politics taken out , it would still remain a vulgar farce .
why waste your spirit on such rubbish ?
surely you can choose more elevated themes .
elevated !
what does that mean , elevated ?
i am fed to the teeth with these ... ... elevated things .
old dead legends .
why must we go on forever writing of gods and legends ?
because they do .
they go on forever .
at least what they represent : the eternal in us .
opera is here to ennoble us , mozart .
you and me , just the same as his majesty .
bello , bello , bello .
come on now , be honest !
you' d rather listen to your hairdresser than hercules , horatius or orpheus .
people so lofty , they sound as if they shit marble !
what !
govern your tongue , mozart !
how dare you !
forgive me , majesty .
i' m a vulgar man ... ... but i assure you , my music is not .
you are passionate , mozart ... ... but you do not persuade .
sire , the whole opera is finished .
do you know how much work went into it ?
his majesty has been more than patient , " signore " .
how can i persuade if i can' t show it ?
that will do , " herr mozart " .
just let me tell you how it begins .
may i just do that , majesty ?
show you how it begins ?
just that ?
please .
look ...
there' s a servant on his knees .
do you know why ?
not from oppression .
he' s measuring a space .
do you know what for ?
his bed .
his wedding bed .
to see if it will fit !
late .
late !
on the beat .
good !
yes !
early !
well , mozart is already rehearsing .
in that case , gentlemen , i think ...
i think we should help mozart all we can .
and protect him against the emperor' s anger .
what anger ?
about the ballet .
what ballet ?
excuse me ... ... but didn' t his majesty specifically forbid the ballet in his opera ?
herr mozart !
yes ?
a word with you .
certainly , " herr direktor " .
now , " herr mozart " !
five minutes , please .
five minutes !
yes ?
do you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas ?
it' s not a ballet , it' s a dance .
exactly .
a dance .
surely , his majesty didn' t mean no dancing when it' s in the story .
it' s dangerous to interpret his edicts .
give me your score , please .
thank you .
what are you doing , " herr direktor " ?
taking out what you should never have put in .
please .
please !
i have no one else to turn to .
what is it ?
it' s unbelievable .
the " direktor " has torn up a huge section of my music .
they say i have to rewrite the opera .
but it' s perfect as it is .
i can' t ... ... rewrite what' s perfect .
please .
can' t you talk to him ?
please .
why bother ?
he' s no friend of yours .
i could kill him !
i mean , really !
kill him !
i threw the entire score into the fire , he made me so angry .
you burned the score ?
no , my wife took it out in time .
thank god .
it' s unfair that a man like that should have power over our work !
but there are those who have power over him .
i think i' il take this up with the emperor .
excellency ... ... would you ?
with all my heart , mozart .
thank you .
please , " herr mozart " .
please , it' s not a holy relic .
i don' t need to tell you i said nothing , whatever , to the emperor .
i went to the theater to tell mozart something , anything ... ... when suddenly , in the middle of the third act ... ... to my astonishment , the emperor ... ... who never attended rehearsals , suddenly appeared .
what is this ?
i don' t understand .
is it modern ?
majesty ... ... the " herr direktor " ... ... he has removed " un balletto " ... ... that would have occurred at this place .
why ?
it is your regulation , sire .
no ballet in your opera .
salieri .
do you like this ?
it' s not a question of liking , majesty .
your own law decrees it , i' m afraid .
well , look at them !
no !
this is nonsense !
let me see the scene with the music .
but , sire !
oblige me !
yes , majesty .
can we see the scene with the music , please ?
certainly !
certainly , " herr direktor " !
bring the palace set back in , please .
the restored third act ... ... was bold , brilliant .
the fourth ... ... was astounding .
i saw a woman ... ... disguised in her maid' s clothes hear her husband speak the first ... ... tender words he has offered her in years .
simply because he thinks she is someone else .
i heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theater ... ... conferring on all who sat there , perfect absolution .
god was singing through this little man ... ... to all the world .
unstoppable .
making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar .
and then , do you know what happened ?
a miracle !
with that yawn ... ...
i saw my defeat turn into a victory .
mozart was lucky the emperor yawned only once .
three yawns ... ... and the opera would fail the same night .
two yawns , within a week at most .
with one yawn , the composer could still get ...
nine performances !
nine !
that' s all it' s had !
withdrawn !
i know , i know .
it' s outrageous .
still , if the public doesn' t like one' s work ... ... one has to accept the fact gracefully .
but what is it that they don' t like ?
i can speak for the emperor .
you make too many demands on the royal ear .
the poor man can' t concentrate for more than an hour .
you gave him four .
what did you think of it yourself ?
did you like it at all ?
i thought it was marvelous .
of course .
it' s the best opera yet written .
i know it !
why didn' t they come ?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese , friend .
you didn' t give them a bang at the end of songs ... ... to let them know when to clap .
i know , i know .
maybe you should give me some lessons in that .
i wouldn' t presume .
nevertheless , at the risk of imposing ... ... i' d like you to see my new piece .
it would be an honor for me .
no , the honor would be all mine .
i believe ...
i believe ... ... it is the best opera yet written , my friends .
salieri !
you are the brightest star in the musical firmament .
you do honor to vienna and to me .
herr mozart " !
it was good of you to come .
how could i not ?
bravo , maestro .
did my work please you ?
i never knew that music like that was possible .
you flatter me .
no .
salieri !
everybody' s here and we' ve got guests .
bravo !
well , i' ve got some more .
you remember my good friend schikaneder .
come in .
don' t be shy .
this is a very nice girl , and this ...
wolfie ?
yes , my love ?
these gentlemen are from salzburg .
salzburg ?
we were just talking about salzburg .
your father is dead .
so rose the dreadful ghost ... ... from his next and blackest opera .
there on the stage , stood the figure of a dead commander .
i knew ... ... only i understood ... ... that the horrifying apparition was leopold ... ... raised from the dead !
wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father ... ... to accuse his son before all the world !
it was ... ... terrifying and wonderful to watch .
and now ...
... the madness began in me .
the madness of a man splitting in half .
through my influence , i saw to it ... ...
don giovanni " was played only five times in vienna .
but , in secret , i went to every one of those five .
worshiping sound i alone seemed to hear .
and as i stood there , understanding how ... ... that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son ... ... even from beyond the grave ... ...
i began to see a way ... ... a terrible way ... ... i could finally triumph ... ... over god .
herr mozart " ?
i have come to commission work from you .
what work ?
a mass for the dead .
what dead ?
who is dead ?
a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one .
who are you ?
i am only a messenger .
do you accept ?
you will be well paid .
do you accept ?
work fast .
and be sure tell no one what you do .
you will see me again soon .
wolfie ?
my plan was so simple ... ... that it terrified me .
first , i must get the death mass , and then ... ... i must achieve his death .
what ?
his funeral !
imagine it !
the cathedral , all vienna sitting there .
his coffin .
mozart' s little coffin in the middle .
and then ... ... in that silence ... ... music .
a divine music ... ... bursts out over them all .
a great mass of death .
requiem mass for wolfgang mozart .
composed by his devoted friend ... ... antonio salieri .
what sublimity !
what depth !
what passion in the music !
salieri has been touched by god at last ... ... and god forced to listen !
powerless to stop it !
i , for once , in the end , laughing at him !
the only thing that worried me was the actual killing .
how does one do that ?
how does one kill a man ?
it' s one thing ... ... to dream about it .
very different when you ...
when you have to do it ... ... with your own hands .
come in !
i' ve come to dinner
dinner !
are you mad ?
i' m a nobleman !
i only ever dine with people of my own height !
stop it !
be careful be careful
hold tight
i' m a famous ... ... horseman
and we' re a famous horsy
give me a hoof , my darling
and i' il give you my heart
take me to your stable
and never more we' il part
kill me kill me
we' re going to make a soprano stew
we' re going to make a soprano stew
and when you make a soprano stew
shut up !
i' m sick to death of that tune !
give me some hay , my darling
and i' il give you my heart
leporello !
some hay !
we hope ... ... you' re contented
with what ... ... we' ve presented
and love our dove of peace
what did you think ?
it was wonderful !
he liked the little people .
it' s all in good fun .
i liked the horse .
i tell you , if you played " don giovanni " here ... ... you would' ve had a wonderful success .
you belong here .
not at the snobby court .
you could do anything you like .
the more fantastic , the better .
that' s what people want : fantasy .
you write a proper part for me ... ... a couple of catchy songs ... ... i guarantee you a triumph deluxe !
what do you say ?
how much will you pay him ?
well !
i see you brought your manager with you .
well , madame ... ... how about half the receipts ?
half the receipts !
stanzi !
i' m talking about now .
how much will you pay him now ?
down payment .
down payment ?
who do you think i am , the emperor ?
i have to go .
stay here , you' il enjoy this next one .
you won' t do this .
why not ?
half the house !
when ?
we need money now !
he pays you now , or you don' t do it .
i don' t trust that man .
i don' t like what he did with your opera .
it was common .
you liked it .
monkey , punky , flunky !
half the house .
you' il never see a penny .
i want it here in my hand .
i' il put it here in your hand .
shut up !
you won' t put a thing in my hand until i see some money !
it' s embarrassing .
can' t you think of anyone who can do something for him ?
i' m afraid mozart is a lost cause , baron .
he has succeeded in alienating practically the whole of vienna .
he never pays his debts .
i can' t think of anyone to whom i' d dare recommend him .
herr mozart " .
what a surprise !
what can i do for you ?
is my pupil still interested in learning the art of music ?
your pupil is married and living in mannheim , young man .
really ?
perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction .
what is it , mozart ?
what' s the matter with you ?
well ... ... since it appears no one is eager to hire my services ... ... could you favor me with a little money instead ?
what for ?
if a man cannot earn , he must borrow .
that' s hardly the way to go about it .
you are right , sir .
you are right .
but you see , i am endowed with talent , and you with money .
if i offer mine ... ... you should offer yours .
i' m sorry , no .
please .
my answer is no , mozart .
please .
please !
don' t answer it .
why ?
tell him ...
tell him i' m not here .
tell him ...
tell him i' m working on it .
come back later .
am i interrupting something ?
no .
good .
where' s our friend ?
he' s not here .
but he' s working on it , he told me to tell you .
is that it ?
is he happy with it ?
what' s this ?
a requiem mass ?
you think i' m in the funeral business ?
leave that alone !
put it down !
it' s nothing for you !
i' m sorry .
what have you got for me ?
finished ?
what ?
the vaudeville , what do you think ?
yes .
can i see it ?
no .
why not ?
because there' s nothing to see .
look ... ... i asked you if we could start rehearsals next week and you said yes .
well , we can .
so let me see it .
where is it ?
here .
it' s all right here in my noodle .
the rest is just scribbling .
scribbling and bibbling .
bibbling and scribbling .
like a drink ?
look , you little cunt !
do you know how many people i' ve hired ?
leave him alone !
i' m paying them !
he' s doing his best .
paying them to wait .
it' s ridiculous !
you know what' s ridiculous ?
your libretto !
only an idiot would ask him to work on that !
twelve foot snakes , magic flutes ?
what' s so intelligent about a requiem ?
money .
money .
you' re mad .
she' s mad .
oh , yes ?
wolfie , write it down .
just write it down .
on paper .
it' s no use to anybody in your head .
to hell with your death mass !
calm yourself .
what' s the matter with you ?
i won' t work there anymore .
what happened ?
you don' t know what it' s like .
herr mozart " frightens me .
he drinks all day ... ... then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse .
is he working ?
oh , i am frightened , sir , really !
when he speaks , he makes no sense .
is he working ?
i suppose so .
he sits there all the time , doing some silly opera .
opera ?
don' t ask me to go back again .
i' m frightened .
i' m very , very frightened !
are you sure it' s an opera ?
i don' t have it yet .
are you neglecting my request ?
no .
no , i ...
i promise you ... ... i' il give you a wonderful piece , the best i ever ...
this is my wife , stanzi .
i' ve been sick , but i' m all right now , aren' t i ?
yes , sir .
he' s all right .
and he' s working on it very hard .
give me two more weeks .
please .
the sooner you finish , the greater your reward .
work .
wolfie .
i think you really are going mad .
you slave for that idiot actor who won' t give you a penny !
and here , this is not a ghost !
this is a real man , who puts down real money .
why on earth won' t you finish it ?
can you give me one reason i can understand ?
it' s killing me .
you' re drunk , aren' t you ?
be honest , tell me .
you' ve been drinking .
it' s not fair .
i worry about you all the time .
i do everything i can to help you .
and all you do is drink and talk nonsense , and frighten me .
go back to bed !
please .
let me ...
let me sit here .
let me stay here with you .
i did it .
and i was proud to do it .
leave ! " i said .
right away .
take the child with you !
go to the spa and get your health back . " i was shocked .
shocked to my foundation when i saw her .
i couldn' t believe my eyes , poor little thing .
you monster !
no one exists but you , do they ?
you and your music .
i warned her .
choose a man , not a baby " , i said .
you marry him , you won' t have a pot to piss in . " you selfish thing !
selfish , that' s what you are .
simply selfish !
do you hear me ?
pick him up .
pick him up !
be careful .
come with me .
you , follow me .
is it over ?
yes , it' s over .
it' s over .
go !
go , go .
go .
go !
go !
where is your wife ?
where is your wife ?
she' s not well either .
she went to the spa .
you are so good to me .
truly .
thank you .
please !
no , i mean to come to my opera .
you .
you are the only colleague of mine who came .
mozart .
i would never miss anything you had written .
it' s just a vaudeville .
no , no !
it' s a sublime piece .
the grandest " operone " !
i tell you ... ... you are the greatest composer known to me .
do you mean it ?
it' s him !
who ?
the man .
he' s here .
tell him to go away .
tell him i' m still working on it .
don' t let him in .
no , no .
wait !
ask him if he would give me some money now .
tell him if he would , it will help me to finish it .
salieri ?
yes .
can we come in ?
better not .
he' s sleeping .
he' s all right , though ?
yes , he' s just exhausted .
he became dizzy , that' s all .
well , tell him we came by , won' t you ?
of course .
give him this .
that' s his share .
that should cheer him up .
indeed !
and now , good night to you all .
it was ... ... perfection , truly .
thank you .
what happened ?
he said to give you this .
and if you finish by tomorrow night ... ... he will pay you another hundred ducats .
another ... ?
that' s too soon .
tomorrow night ...
it' s impossible .
did he say a hundred ?
yes .
it' s too soon .
can i ... ?
could i help you ?
would you ?
actually , you could .
i want to go .
where ?
i want to go back to vienna .
now ?
yes .
why ?
i feel wrong .
i feel wrong being here .
where did i stop ?
the end of the " recordare " .
so now " confutatis " ...
how would you translate that ?
consigned to flames of woe .
do you believe in it ?
what ?
