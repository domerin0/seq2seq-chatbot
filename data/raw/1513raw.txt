ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls , children of all ages , you are about to enter the world of darkness , a world where life and death are meaningless , and pain is god .
pain !
billy , let' s go .
quit that , sport .
sorry , captain spaulding .
we gonna have a good time now .
on your right , you will see the infamous albert ...
fish .
masochist , sadist , child killer and most importantly , cannibal .
mr. fish , born 1870 and enjoyed spankings with nail studded paddles , stuffing needles deep into his groin .
i have a question .
how many  hold all questions .
no , no , help .
lizzie fucking borden .
now , one of our most famous crazies , the psycho of plainsfield , mr. ed gein .
murderer , cannibal ,
mr. gein used to take great pleasure of playing with dead bodies of women , especially , their sexual organs .
now , one of our local heroes ,
s. quentin quale , aka dr. satan .
oh shit !
murderer , torturer , but most of all , master surgeon .
mr. quail was an intern at willows county mental hospital , nicknamed weeping willows for the neverending cries of pain .
through primitive brain surgery
jerry , stop it .
mr. quail believed that he could create a race of superhumans from the mentally ill .
vigilante justice prevailed .
they took his ass out and hung him .
and that infamous hanging tree is no more than a stone' s throw away from where y' alls ' ass is now seated .
but the next day his body was found to be missing .
until today no trace of dr. satan has ever been discovered .
but then , who knows ?
maybe he lives next door to you .
tour' s over .
exit through the doors .
that was so bad ass .
dr. satan .
ah hhh , dr. satan .
maybe he lives next door to you .
calm down , it was all right .
do you think maybe we could go now ?
i' m gonna go call my dad .
i' il be right back .
i love you .
what do you mean , it was all right ?
it was cool , but it wasn' t that great .
dude , you don' t have to play it down in front of your chick .
oh .
thank you .
don' t move a muscle , an artery ,  or a vein .
hello ?
hey , dad .
wow , denise .
we stopped for gas at this place called captain spaulding' s , somewhere outside of ruggsville .
it turned into this whole big thing , so we' re behind schedule .
don' t be too late .
i forgot to tell you that halloween falls on a school night so they' re trick or treating tonight .
your left hand shows your past ; your right hand shows your future .
good evening .
i' m lance brockwell and this is the 7 : 00 news .
and our top story tonight , investigators still have no leads to the strange disappearance of the five cheerleaders from ruggsville high school .
cindy thompson , karen murphy ,
allison cole , valarie green , and dawn baker were last seen four days ago leaving a football game .
i know it seems stupid , but i really wanna see this tree .
do yourself a favor , son , just forget about it .
oh , come on , i live for this shit .
okay , all right , i' il draw you a damn map .
thank you .
i still say it' s a waste of time .
you are here .
go straight up this road .
make the first right .
first left .
come straight across and down .
can' t find it ?
tough .
here' s your map .
right on .
here' s your complimentary chicken .
oh , wow .
don' t let the door hit you in the ass on the way out .
you' re gonna get a great write up for this .
here' s an idea , let' s just skip it .
it' s probably nothing anyway .
christ , jerry , bill is right , we can' t see anything .
what' s that ?
hitchhiker .
what ?
should we stop ?
we can' t leave her in the rain .
stick her in the front if you wanna pick her up so bad .
so , uh ,
where ya headed ?
i was just going home .
home , where' s that ?
a couple miles up the road .
so , you live around here ?
yeah .
do you know where this dr. satan tree' s at ?
yeah .
you know where that' s at ?
it' s right by my house .
i can show you .
really ?
so , it is a real thing .
fuck you .
so , a tree ?
where' s it at ?
what tree ?
okay , this is crazy .
she obviously doesn' t know anything .
oh , i know , i' il show you where it' s at .
whatever you need to do , you do it .
there is no wrong .
lf someone needs to be killed , you kill ' em .
that' s the way .
fuck .
i think we blew a tire .
oh poop .
oh , hell .
at least we got that spare .
you filled it up like i asked , right ?
yeah , yeah .
okay , what if i forgot to put it back in the trunk ?
what would plan b entail ?
jesus christ , jerry .
technically i did what you said .
oh for fucking sake , jerry , what' re we gonna do now ?
i can' t rightly say if i know , me ladies .
wait , i love this song .
would you turn the radio off , please ? !
god !
we can walk to my house from here .
what ?
my brother' s got a tow truck .
he can come get your car .
i' il go , it' s my fault .
forget it , i' m going .
no , bill , l  you guys stay here .
there' s no sense in everyone getting drenched .
returning to the news , local authorities still have no lead in the mysterious disappearance of the five cheerleaders from ruggsville .
the girls were last seen
leaving a cheering competition ...
actor # 1 : ... lt was loud enough to wake the dead .
that' s an idea .
what is ?
wouldn' t it be dramatic ?
supposing the people inside were dead , all stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them .
i' m sure it would be very amusing .
why you ask ?
why is not the question .
how ?
now , that is a question worth examining .
how could i , being born of such conventional stock , arrive a leader of the rebellion ?
an escapist from a conformist world , destined to find happiness only in that which cannot be explained .
i brought you here for a reason .
but unfortunately , you and your sentimental minds are doing me no good .
my brain is frozen ,
locked .
i have to break free from this culture of mechanical reproductions and the thick incrustations dying on the surface .
oh , christ .
fuck it .
these are all my dolls .
i used to chop their heads off and their arms and stick them up on the wall .
the door' s locked , i gotta go around .
just wait here .
jesus christ !
don' t do that .
you scared the shit out of me .
you ain' t seen nothing yet .
ls your brother ready to go ?
yeah , he already left .
come on , inside .
what ?
he left ?
come on and get toasty .
don' t worry about it , he' s fine .
i just don' t understand why
what was that ?
what ?
i didn' t hear anything .
turn the radio off .
now listen .
i still don' t hear anything .
i swear to god , i heard some weird
turn on the headlights , see if something' s out there .
calm down , calm down .
jesus h. christ .
it' s the fucking tow truck guy .
so , you live alone here ?
i mean , just you and your brother ?
nah , there' s a bunch of us around somewhere .
i think otis is upstairs messing around or something .
you gotta have the marshmallows .
that' s what makes it fun .
yeah , i guess .
you sure do a lot of guessing .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
wow .
look at him .
he must' ve been going pretty fast to smash through that wall .
you sure are silly for a guy with glasses .
i like that .
okay , hey .
need those to see , thank you .
how do i look ?
terrific , really .
tasty .
ain' t the only thing tasty in this house .
okay , okay .
i wonder what time
it' s getting kind of late .
don' t worry , sugar .
it ain' t past my bedtime
are you flirting with me ?
what ?
oh , no .
great !
they' re back .
whoppie fucking do .
excuse me ?
i gotta call my dad and tell him we' re gonna be late .
can i use your phone , please ?
hello ?
ain' t got one .
oh , hi .
goodness .
you really don' t have a phone ?
no .
i once had one back in ' 57 , but
i don' t quite remember .
there' s nobody round here .
i feel like jaw flapping at no more .
do you think the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone ?
his name is rufus , rufus jr .
but we all call him
rj .
makes sense .
what do they call you , sweetie ?
i am qualsnarg of the crab nebula .
but you humans can call me jerry .
jerry .
baby , go on and see how rj' s doin ' with these nice folks ' automobile .
why don' t you just all make yourselves to home ?
what brings you kids way out here ?
haven' t you got something better to do on halloween than wander around out in the sticks ?
i thought maybe we' d take in a hoedown .
no , he' s just joking .
you are ?
i' m sorry , i' m messing with you .
shut up , dude .
oh , i get it .
y' all just think you' re too good for the simple pleasures of halloween .
no , just a little too old .
oh really ?
i hope something changes your mind someday .
mama , tiny' s home .
what about rj ?
he was gone before i seen him .
but tiny saw him and said he said he was going down to the yard to get a new wheel .
how long is that gonna take ?
probably be back in a couple of hours .
a couple of hours ?
what ?
can' t tiny drive us to a phone ?
tiny ain' t got no car , he ain' t even got a bicycle .
even though i know that you think it is childish , tonight is halloween eve , and to us it is special .
so you are all invited to dinner .
i hope to christ she don' t expect us to wear these things .
what ever it is , just do it .
the more we play along the faster we' il get the hell out of here .
now is not the time to make waves .
jerry .
you' il have to forgive tiny .
he can' t hear so much .
that poor baby .
it' s his daddy' s fault .
earl wasn' t a bad man , he never hit me or nothing like that .
one day he just up and went devil on us all .
what happened ?
he tried to burn down the house .
he said it was possessed by the spirits .
and tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started .
but i don' t think earl ever meant to harm us .
tiny was badly burnt , his ears were destroyed and most of his skin .
ls that why he wears the mask ?
yeah .
my baby boy gets shy around new people , but he' il warm up to you , especially the girls .
he' s a real lady killer .
# all the kids wanna sniff some glue #
# all the kids want somethin ' to do ... #
you' re gonna miss a good show tonight .
that' s your tough luck .
i thought you kids were all about team spirit .
you ain' t done fuck all to cheer me up since you got here .
give me a b. give me an a.
give me a b. give me a y.
what' s that spell ?
what' s that spell ? !
what' s that spell ? !

can we ?
gosh , kid , put it on .
she ain' t gonna let any of us touch dessert unless you' re wearing this damn thing .
mrs. firefly ?
do you know anything about the legend of dr. satan ?
here we go .
shut up .
i' m not much for gossip and this and that ,
but i have heard  i know all about what you wanna know all about .
otis .
i can' t believe you decided to come down and join us .
and you brought little wolf .
oh , my baby .
oh my god .
it' s such a special night for me .
i don' t know who told you your fairy fables about dr. satan .
we heard it from a captain spaulding up the road at
that old bitch hog don' t know shit .
tells this cute little tattle tales to sell his junk , but he don' t sell no yankee boys no truth .
something happened , right ?
it had to be based on some real incident .
are you , jimmy olsen , cub reporter for the daily asshole ?
grampa , watch your language .
i don' t think you need to know .
better you leave here with your head still full of kitty cats and puppy dogs .
i really would like to know  hey , he' d really like to know .
enlighten him .
i bet you' d stick your head in fire if i told ya you could see hell .
meanwhile , you' re too stupid to realize you got a demon sticking out your ass singing , " holy miss moley ,

where was she going ?
i don' t know .
she was with some stupid kids .
they' s nosing around , asking a bunch of stupid questions .
questions about what ?
i don' t know .
this and that .
mostly a bunch of tired dr. satan bullshit .
they caught a gander at the display in the back and they figured they' s gonna run out and solve the great deadwood mystery .
and how' d they get that idea ?
i wrote ' em a map .
out to the old farm road .
i figured , what the hell ?
it wouldn' t do no harm .
' sides , it' s good for my tourist trade .
you can shit 10 bricks for all i care .
what else ?
nothin ' .
