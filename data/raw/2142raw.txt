the hostile apache that dutchy and i had been pursuing had gotten away .
needless to say , at the time , i was humiliated .
but much later i decided the incident had come out for the best .
i' m quite content to go to my grave knowing that i' ve never killed an apache .
you all right , mr. sieber ?
caught up with three bucks and some stolen ponies .
gave one of them to mr. davis .
seems he got away .
sergeant mulrey , check the area for a dead hostile !
sir !
now , we crossing to mexico tomorrow ?
that' s right .
we ought to send some of the scouts back .
i don' t trust them south of the border .
geronimo' s got a few of them spooked .
they' re wondering ... ... if they' re on the wrong side .
i don' t think so , mr. sieber .
besides , we need every scout we have .
yes , sir .
i guess you weren' t there then , when dead shot and the others ... ... turned on us at cibecue .
if i had been at cibecue , they wouldn' t have turned .
whole thing wouldn' t have happened , al .
i know you don' t like me much and i don' t really care .
i know i' m rough in some of my ways , i guess .
i ain' t the gentleman type .
but , i think ... ... compared to you , i am somewhat honest .
no offence intended , lieutenant .
speaking off the record , sir .
i just figure you' re a real sad case .
you don' t love who you' re fighting for ... ... and you don' t hate who you' re fighting against .
perhaps i could learn to hate with the proper vigour from you , al .
well , maybe you could , lieutenant .
though i never managed to become a close friend of ai sieber ... ... in the next few weeks of campaigning , i did learn to get along with him .
only a fool would fail to profit from his vast experience .
in his own way , he was as taken by the apache ... ... as was lieutenant gatewood .
well , sir ... ... your apache rides a horse to death and eats him and steals another .
i mean , the horse is just mobile food .
i' ve chased them when they made 50 miles a day on horse and foot .
hell , they can live on cactus , go 48 hours without water .
i mean , one week of that would kill your average trooper .
i hear you can track as good as any apache .
that' s right , but there' s only one of me and 1, 000 square miles of apache country .
general crook figured that out , ' cause it takes an apache to catch an apache .
white eyes can' t catch them alone , no sir .
if you ever fight an apache and things go bad , save the last bullet for yourself .
you don' t want to get taken alive , no sir .
they got lots of ways to kill you .
one of their favourites is to strip you , tie you upside down to a wagon wheel .
they pour pitch on you , light you on fire .
i know you are angry about this war .
the white eye ... ... gave me no choice .
i ask your blessing .
you ask my blessing after this thing is done .
what i did is right .
now we are fighting mexicans and white eye .
the reservation is bad , but at least we can stay alive .
we have fought the mexicans for years ... ... and the white eye will never catch us .
many apache will die .
i must send for nantan lupan .
we will talk with him .
i ask that you do this .
general crook and a small detachment of apache scouts ... ... came across the border into the canyon de los embudos .
crook had agreed to negotiate terms , but he intended a hard bargain .
for the rest of his life , he never forgave geronimo forjumping turkey creek .
crook maintained his sympathy for the apache ... ... but between he and geronimo all trust had vanished .
there is one god looking down on us all .
we are all children of one god .
i didn' t come here to listen to religion .
you broke your word .
you left turkey creek .
you killed many white eye .
you come back .
washington wants you to go to florida .
you do it or l' il come back with my army and fight .
nantan lupan does not understand .
the white eye try to change apache way .
the apache were doing fine farming corn .
the problem was geronimo .
i knew cochise , he was a king .
he was a wise ruler of his people .
i knew vittorio , he was a proud leader .
and i know geronimo .
he doesn' t want to lead or rule or be wise .
he just wants to fight .
i didn' t start this trouble .
the army killed the dreamer .
he was calling for war .
if the medicine man had come in peaceably , he' d be alive .
there' s no excuse for taking up arms against the united states army .
the army' s the best friend the chiricahua ever had .
you know it and i know it .
with all this land , why is there no room for the apache ?
why does the white eye want all land ?
how long in florida ?
maybe two years , with your families .
i think i can get that .
that' s not a bad deal .
a lot of white eyes want to see geronimo hanged for murder .
not murder .
war .
many bad things happen in war .
how many white eye did you kill since you left turkey creek ?
maybe 50 .
maybe more .
how many apaches do you kill ?
you killed women and children .
so did you .
we gain nothing by fighting .
we can live on the reservation .
i go there .
you , nantan lupan ... ... are like a brother to me .
many of my people want to surrender .
when i was young ... ... the white eye came and wanted the land of my people .
when their soldiers burnt our villages , we moved to the mountains .
when they took our food ... ... we ate thorns .
when they killed our children ... ... we had more .
we killed all white eye that we could .
we starved and we killed ... ... but in our hearts ... ... we never surrendered .
c. s. fly , a photographer from tombstone ... ... requested permission to accompany general crook to mexico ... ... and record the negotiations .
much to everyone' s surprise , crook agreed .
even more surprising , geronimo and the other chiricahua also agreed .
in some mysterious way , they seemed to understand these pictures ... ... would make them immortal .
they are the only known photos ever taken of the american lndian ... ... as an enemy in the field .
old nana and his people ...
will return to turkey creek .
many of his people are too old to fight .
nantan lupan will make all of you a prisoner .
we have to trust him .
there is no other way .
i called him my brother .
go if you must .
i have made my decision .
i will not surrender to the white eye .
i will stay with you and fight .
but now we will be very few .
' thereby i tender my resignation as commander of this department .
' i have served you well in the past , but my judgment has been called into question .
' without doubt , i made an error in trusting the word of geronimo ...
' ... that he would surrender .
' perhaps others will be more correct or more fortunate .
' that is , to the apache people .
' they have lost in me a true friend ... ' ... and they have few .
' george crook , brigadier general , united states army . '
i was forced to send this to washington a day ago .
they' ve accepted my resignation ... ... with regrets .
general nelson miles will replace me .
there' s nothing to be done , general ?
nothing .
graceful retirement for a general who could not catch geronimo .
settlers , prospectors , land speculators , they won' t admit it ... ... but the truth is they' d all like to see the lndian dead .
they see the army as their weapon .
the army that fight the apache is the only hope of keeping the apache alive .
only the army can protect them .
yes , sir .
i fought them a long time , general ... ... and i figure if i was one of them , i' d be standing next to geronimo ... ... shooting at the blue coats .
but god made me who i am and between them or us ... ... l figure it' s us .
well , damn it , al .
is that the only way we could win ?
well , i can' t answer that question .
i' m just a hired hand .
i just want to say , i didn' t always agree with you ... ... but you had my respect .
and while you was in charge ... ... the army was a proper piece of work .
sir .
so , i' m going to quit this damn fool job .
i' m going to go on down to tucson and ... ... l' m going to get drunk .
take it easy , al .
yes , sir .
al .
general miles brought with him an entirely new staff of line officers .
lieutenant gatewood , myself and many others ... ... had to taste the humiliation of being dismissed from the field .
i' m honoured to be here with you men of the sixth cavalry .
honoured to be here by the order of the president of the united states .
we are charged with bringing in the renegade apache , geronimo .
we will accomplish this task .
we will succeed .
over reliance on apache scouts .
men of divided loyalties .
i will keep troops in the field until the enemy is fully subjugated ... ... fully pacified .
there will be no compromise with the honour of our nation .
there will be no compromise with the honour of the united states army .
captain .
as he had promised , general miles sent troops forward ... ... without the apache scouts .
for the next five months , they relentlessly searched ... ... but the results were predictable .
geronimo and his tiny band of chiricahua ... ... had vanished deep into the mountains of mexico .
it seemed they were chasing a spirit more than a man .
lieutenant .
i doubt if you' re enjoying your current assignment .
nothing personal , i understand you' re a fine officer .
do you know why i called you here , gatewood ?
no , sir .
tomorrow a new policy change will be announced .
as punishment for geronimo' s resistance .
all chiricahua living on reservation land are to be rounded up and sent to florida .
they will stay there until geronimo is captured or killed .
that' s a harsh penalty that he' s drawn on his own people .
i hear you and geronimo were friendly .
any relationship i' ve had has never compromised my effectiveness in the field .
i need you to speak freely with me .
can you find geronimo , talk to him ?
i thought so once .
there' s no way to be sure now .
the signs are that he' s starving , or close to it .
living on cactus and rabbits .
i know this because i' ve got observation points ... ... and 5, 000 troops stretched from here to sonora ... ... searching for
thirty five apache , sir .
that' s what i believe he' il be down to in a month' s time .
thirty five starving apache .
begging the general' s pardon , sir , but why not leave him to the mexicans ?
he can' t continue to keep raiding across the border .
he can' t afford to lose any more warriors , can' t replace them .
the present political situation demands results .
i want you to find geronimo and make him this proposal .
i have the authority to hunt him all the way to south america if i have to ... ... but i want this nonsense to end .
now , i' m willing to give you all the scouts you need ... ... hundred man detail , regular cavalry , mule pack team .
a hundred men won' t do .
how many do you want ?
three .
i' d like to pick them myself .
whatever happens , lieutenant ... ... this conversation that you and i are having never took place .
any negotiations with geronimo are to be strictly confidential .
is that understood ?
two years in florida .
two years in florida , with their families .
and when they return to reservation land here in arizona territory ... ... every warrior gets 40 acres of land ... ... two mules .
i don' t think you or the government intend to keep this promise .
you just offer it .
none of the rest is your concern .
do you know your scripture , sir ?
' what does it profit a man to gain the whole world ... ' ... and lose his soul ? '
lieutenant .
you have your orders .
lieutenant gatewood chose the apache scout , chato , to accompany him ... ... as well as myself and ai sieber , who became bored with his retirement .
after four weeks of tracking geronimo through the mountains of sonora ... ... we came across a burning lndian village .
what we found there was unspeakable .
there' s two dead women there .
two little kids .
scalped them all , all four of them .
bounty hunters .
government down here pays 200 pesos a head for the men .
100 for the women ... ... and 50 for those kids .
kill any lndian , then claim they' re apache .
i don' t see how any man can sink that low .
must be texans , lowest form of white man there is .
who are these people ?
they are yaqui , not apache .
the dying yaqui told me five white eye and a comanche ...
they attacked before dawn .
most of the men got away .
they go up into the hills ... ... and come back one day , maybe two .
and come back for their families .
and build big fire and burn the bodies .
and they go join up with other yaqui tribe ... ... maybe find new wives .
they go off that way into the hills .
after they hunt yaqui men they go to soyapos ... ... get their money .
you and sieber , i want you to track the bounty hunters that did this .
geronimo is here .
you want me to ride ?
i' m ready
you need more rest ...
the women have gathered medicine .
do we leave at dawn ?
don' t worry .
we will not fight tomorrow .
sleep .
i have just seen my power .
an iron horse comes over the desert .
i have seen a vision .
an iron horse for the apache .
been down here ... ... almost 20 years .
i was in the war .
confederate officer .
after the hostilities ended ... ... l went to texas .
got into a little scrape with the law .
come down here , got a new name .
new start .
wife .
family .
but in my heart ... ... well , hell ... ... l' m still a tennessee man .
my wife and her sisters ... ... they trade with apache women .
they come down from the mountains .
they' ve done it for years .
few days back , some chiricahua showed up near here .
where ?
straight up montana avarripe .
i didn' t expect to see many americans down here .
where you fellows from ?
texas .
i keep a house in brewster county .
awful far from home , ain' t you ?
well , we just came down here to try to make ourselves a living .
and what about you , friend ?
it seems like you' ve got a real curious nature .
you the law ?
me ?
hell , no .
i' m just hunting that son of a bitch geronimo .
thought you might' ve come across something to help me out .
i' m sorry , amigo .
we ain' t seen nothing .
apache !
why don' t you sit down there , while we have us a drink .
we' il take real good care of you .
cover my back .
anything happens , fire .
and keep firing .
sir .
that apache is with us .
don' t look like it to me .
he' s a sergeant of scouts ... ... in the united states army .
who the hell are you ?
charles gatewood .
lieutenant , sixth cavalry .
you boys are out of uniform .
maybe he ought to wear one .
somebody down here take that scalp of his ... ... make themselves a little money .
ten days ago , we came across a yaqui village .
all the lndians slaughtered .
we come across the same type of thing a while back .
i tell you , this is a crazy country .
$100 ... ... buys that scalp back .
nice doing business with you , mr. gatewood .
but ... ... l changed my mind .
you rotten son of a bitch .
amigo .
move it , dixie boy .
goddamn .
i never thought i' d get killed trying to help save an apache .
we got them , mr. sieber .
we got them all .
i' ve been gun shot , arrow shot 17 times .
twenty years chasing old geronimo .
i' d love nothing better than being there to ... ... finish .
you don' t have to account yourself to me , al .
you' re a brave man .
i never did have no kind of luck .
never did .
i' m going to catch me a little sleep here for ... ... a minute or two .
rotten sons of bitches .
gatewood !
no more burro !
can' t go higher !
chato and i ... ... are going on here alone .
you stay with the supplies .
sir .
are you giving me a choice ?
that' s an order , lieutenant .
i know it' s hard to come this far then stop , and i' m sorry .
but somebody' s got to go back and tell the truth .
britton ... ... you' re a fine officer .
stay noble .
we' re trying to make a country here .
it' s hard .
why did you bring him ?
he is an enemy to his people !
he thinks you are .
he is a brave man to come here .
enough chiricahua are dead .
they are dead because the white eye killed them .
have they taught you to lie , gatewood ?
i don' t lie .
but the truth is , general miles will hunt you for 50 years .
he' s already sent your families to florida , which is far , far away .
look around .
see how few warriors you have left .
if i kill white eyes forever ... ... l am still geronimo , an apache .
who are you , gatewood ?
just a man like you .
and i want to go home .
i want to see my family .
my god ....
my god is a god of peace .
a god of life , not death .
what does your god say ?
yosin is not here with us on the mountain .
tell me , what is in your heart ?
the war is over .
i offer this ... ... because it has power for me .
our fight must end here .
when i was young , i took a wife .
we lived in these mountains .
we have our family .
the mexican soldiers came and they killed her .
they killed her and my two little girls .
they killed them because we are apache .
i remember when i found their bodies .
i stood until much time had passed , not knowing what to do .
i had no weapon ... ... but i did not want to fight .
i did not pray .
i did not do anything .
i had no purpose left .
after a year had passed ... ... my power showed me how to get revenge .
and always , since then , i get revenge .
but no matter how many i kill ... ... l could not bring back my family .
yosin ... ... the apache god , is a god of peace .
i gave you the blue stone .
you give me this .
it will be peace .
on september 4 , 1886 ... ... geronimo and 34 chiricahua men , women and children ... ... surrendered to general nelson miles .
' once i moved about like the wind .
now i surrender and that is all . '
he refused any further conversation with the general .
after arranging geronimo' s final surrender ... ... lieutenant gatewood was transferred to a remote garrison in northern wyoming .
his continued presence would have been an embarrassing reminder ... ... that the united states army had failed to defeat a band of 35 apache .
instead of being rewarded with a medal for his heroic efforts ... ... lieutenant charles gatewood was sentenced to obscurity .
sir , formation is ready .
attention !
prepare to mount !
present arms !
mount !
detail , arms , halt !
' by order of the office of the president of the united states ...
' ... all chiricahua scouts are under arrest ...
' ... and will be transported to fort marion prison ...
' ... saint augustine , florida ...
' ... with the outlaw apaches , led by goyakla , known as geronimo !
' the apache scouts from the white mountain ...
' ... coyotero and mescalero tribes are to return at once ...
' ... to their reservations .
' they will remain within these boundaries unless given express permission to travel .
' their duties for the united states army are at an end .
' we thank them for their services . '
detail !
collect arms !
i' m a good apache , it' s not right .
i' m sergeant chato , a scout .
later that afternoon , geronimo , his band of renegades ... ... and all the chiricahua that had served the army so faithfully ... ... were loaded into wagons and transported to the railhead at holbrook .
there , they were to begin theirjourney to florida and imprisonment .
halt !
morning report , sir .
mr. glenville , i' d like to see the general .
on what business ?
it' s about mr. gatewood .
sir .
i thought the us army kept its word .
i thought maybe we were the only ones left who did .
what' s going on out there is a disgrace .
lieutenant .
you' re more worried about keeping your word to a savage ... ... than you are fulfilling your duties to the citizens of this country .
we won .
that' s what matters .
it' s over , lieutenant .
geronimo , the apache , the whole history of the west , except being a farmer .
mr. gatewood wouldn' t want me to be a part of any of this .
i hate an idealist .
there' s always something messy about them .
i' m ashamed .
and you have my resignation .
to the disappointment of family and friends ... ... l had ended my military career .
over the years , the events surrounding the geronimo campaign ... ... have continued to haunt me .
i carry the memory of those days ... ... days of bravery and cruelty ... ... of heroism and deceit .
a way of life that endured a thousand years was gone .
this desert ... ... this land that we look out on ... ... would never be the same .
you were right to fight the white eye .
everything they said to me was a lie .
you helped them ...
i will hate you forever .
there are so few of us left ...
we should not hate each other .
she has the coughing sickness .
she will die soon .
maybe the baby , too .
no one knows why the one god let the white eye take our land .
why did there have to be so many of them ?
why did they have so many guns , so many horses ?
for many years , the one god made me a warrior .
no gun , no bullets , could ever kill me .
that was my power ...
now my time is over .
now , maybe , the time of our people is over .
geronimo lived for another 22 years ... ... as a prisoner of war .
despite its promise ... ... the federal government never let him return home .
