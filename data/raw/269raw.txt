i want to propose a toast .

in gold .
let' s figure out how to get out of here first , all right ?
what are you getting , rob ?
i don' t know ... there' s a lot of things you can buy with a lot of money .
you know , i' m just thinking about naked girls in leather seats .
obviously .
see ?
suppose i get the aston martin vanquish ?
there' s not a lot a girl won' t do on the passenger seat of one of those things .
i' m going to get a nad t770 digital decoder with a 70 watt amp and burr brown dacs .
yeah .
it' s a big stereo .
speakers so loud they blow women' s clothes off .
now you' re talking .
$35 million ... you can' t get more creative than that , man ?
i' m going to andalucia , south of spain ... right there .
get me a big house ... get me a libraty full of first editions .

i don' t know ... i haven' t decided yet .
you haven' t decided yet ?

i liked what you said .
i' il take one of each of yours .
well , well , two of everything
for steve then .
two of those .
oy !
loved the toast .
but you could' ve pulled this off with your eyes closed .
no , you were incredible .
just incredible .
you saw the whole picture .
you covered all the angles .
the ones who steal to enrich their lives , and the ones who steal to define their lives .
don' t be the latter .
makes you miss out on what' s really important in this life .
what are you talking about , john ?
you' ve been a good father .
sitting in prisons doesn' t make you a good father .
i spent half my kid' s life in prison .
don' t get to be my age with nothing but this , charlie .
find somebody you want to spend the rest of your life with and hold onto her forever .
okay ?
hey .
let' s go ... i' m freezing my ass off .
yeah .
steve' s getting cold .
you , too ?
i' m all right .
i love you , kid .
you did really great .
thanks , john .
let' s go .
money it' s a gas grab that cash with both hands and make a stash new car , caviar , four star daydream ... you should' ve seen rob behind the wheel of that boat .
he was like don johnson .
oy , yeah , from brixton .
yeah , what the hell do you know about brixton , eh ?
look at this idiot right in the middle of the road .
what' s this , what' s this ?

hey !
take your hands off the wheel .
steve !
don' t even think about it ... just do it .
no , no , no , no ,

steve , what the hell are you doing ?
made a few plans of my own .
there' s nowhere you can go where we won' t find you , steve .
you know that .
i think that' s probably right , john .
go !
go !
charlie .
we got to go , charlie .
you always work in the dark ?
makes me feel like i' m alone .
not bad .
not bad , stella .
damn .
hurley couldn' t crack that safe .
neither could spears .
now you know who to call first .
you' re expensive , stella .
those guys cut us a break on subpoena jobs .
good will , community service .
i do it for the money , paul .
i' il be sending you a bill .
don' t you want to see what' s inside ?
i never look inside .
have a good day .
hey , george .
hi , stella .
i came , i saw , i kicked some ass the pain i cause , it makes me laugh
' cause the way i do my thing is strange time , time for this girl to sing damn if i thought that you would change and my life would stay the same things will come and things will go and one thing i know for sure is that the wreckoning , the wreckoning , the wreckoning i' m walking out the door wreckoning , the wreckoning , the wreckoning oh , it' s time ...
how long to crack it ?
four minutes and 43 seconds .
oh !
you' re the man .
what' s on the lineup ?
todd milliken called .
he has a prototype combination lock .
he wants you to test out .
he says he added two false contact points on the tumbler .
i' il pretend to be stumped for a couple of seconds , give him a thrill .
and , there' s a charlie croker in your office .
says you two know each other .
charlie croker .
hey , stella .
didn' t i tell you i never want to see you again ?
i think it was when you told me how my father died , right in front of your eyes , after you pulled him in for one last job .
we found him , stella .
he' s in los angeles .
the gold bricks he stole from us had a balinese dancer stamped on them .
i just got word , from a contact of mine called skinny pete , that a gold dealer out in l . a .
has been buying those bricks .
yeah ?
well , how do you know it' s him ?
skinny pete sent me this .
steve changed his last name to frazelli .
why you telling me all of this ?
been checking out the databases behind safe companies .
found out steve had a worthington 1000 delivered to his home office .
you don' t install a worthington 1000 unless you' ve got something really big to guard .
no , you don' t .
the problem now is no one in my crew can handle steve' s safe .
and i need somebody i can trust .
look , i' m a professional safe and vault technician .
i' m not a thief .
hey , it' s not about the gold , stella , okay ?
john was like a father to me , too .
look , i' m sorty , all right ?
i just can' t move on until i' ve set things right .
i' ve moved on .
come on , charlie .
come on .
hello ?
i want to see the look on that man' s face when his gold is gone .
he took my father from me ; i' m taking this .
she' s in .
that' s a good thing ?
it' s a vety good thing .
she can crack a worthington 1000 without even flinching .
i' m not sure having a civilian on the crew' s a good idea , charlie .
she' s got the skill and she' s got the motivation .
exactly .
she' s emotional .
you know what happens when emotion gets into it .
look , don' t kid yourself , all right ?
we' re all emotional on this one .
let' s go .
are you ready ?
of course i am .
you' re not ready .
that was quick .
where are they ?
we' re a little early .
i didn' t expect us to get here quite that fast .
there .
that' s lyle .
he' s my computer genius .
you know , he' s who really invented napster .
at least that' s how lyle tells it .
said shawn fanning was his roommate in college and stole his idea .
think it' s his first time riding that bike , though .
hey .
oh ... you okay ?
yeah .

let' s go .
hey , charlie ... handsome , can you help him with the bike ?
yeah , help knievel set up for his next jump .
like a sound you hear that lingers in your ear but you can' t forget , from sundown to sunset no , no it puts a brand new kind of thinkin ' in your mind and you can' t go wrong
' cause you' re groovin ' all day long , ha ha !
california soul ooh ooh ooh california soul ... man , out of all of the places for a thief to hide , this joker picked hollywood .
he' s a punk , but he ain' t stupid .
all right ... we need to figure out a way to get in steve' s house and make a video blueprint of the interior .
i want audio surveillance on his phone .
oh , yeah , i been wanting to tty something .
i crack into the phone company' s remote monitoring system , and fool it into thinking there' s a legal tap on the line .
just reroute the digital copies of the calls to our own listening post .
i been doing it to my ex for years .
how long ?
no ... how long will it take ?
not how long have you been doing it to your ex .
i' il burn through the night ; i' il have it running by morning .
sorty i' m late .
we got to work on getting steve out of the house .
stella , how much time you need with the worthington ?
five minutes flat .
don' t be cocky , young lady .
it' s not the same as opening a safe for the police .
the perspiration on your fingertips , your heart' s pounding in your ears ... whole different ball game .
i appreciate your concern .
i' il be fine .
look , just remember , this is all the easy part , okay ?
it' s the getaway that can get us caught .
so what' s the sketch ?
we drive to union station .
getaway car goes right onto the train with us .
we need to know exactly how long it' s going to take to get from steve' s house to union station .
oh , great .
carson security system .
how good is it ?
carson' s held an annual contest ... $50, 000 to anybody that can bypass the system .
the who' s who of ex cons always show up .
five years running , no one' s been paid .
okay , party people , here' s the status .
it' s an anti scaling fence .
it' s hardened , electro plated steel .
yeah , i' m going to have to paint that up with some nitromin .
security on the property ?
got an armed guard here .
little rent a cop , with a nine millimeter on his hip .
but that booth ... security booth looks prime for a chemical grenade .
nitromin , chemical grenades ... i mean , that stuff' s pretty hard to come by .
yeah , lyle , it' s a bear market .
shit .
this dude got dogs .
i don' t do dogs .
i had a ... real bad experience , man .
what happened ?
i had a bad experience .
damn it .
i' m deaf .
you turn in your badge and your weap ... oh , shoot .
turn in your badge and your weapon !
crush .
i don' t want to see you anywhere near this investigation .
and turn in your badge and your weapon .
i don' t want to see you anywhere near this investigation .
hey !
it' s a green !
turn in your badge and your weapon .
green !
i don' t want to see you anywhere near this ... turn in your badge and your weapon .
unbelievable .
there he is .
let' s get to work .
it' s either bad traffic , peak traffic , slit your wrist traffic .
you know , five people died from smoking in between traffic lights today .
you know , they do have the metrorail , rob .
you could always use that .
that' d be ideal for cartying a ton of gold , wouldn' t it , genius ?
what' s your guesstimate ?
the last 20 times i' ve done the journey , you' ve got an average of 32 minutes and a top time of 50 , but if we had green lights all the way , we could do it in 14 minutes .
wait , you couldn' t get through traffic ?
whoa .
we could do anything with green lights all the way .
lyle ?
lyle ?
i' il see what i can do .
you' re right on time .
all these poor bastards out there , putting their life savings in banks , and s& ls , and mutual funds .
how do they think , when the collapse comes , they can depend on the government ?
i don' t think so .
are you taping me ?
of course not .
i never tape you ... come look , see for yourself .
governments are nothing more than puppets and strings in a world where nafta can overrule the supreme court .
like my cousin mashkov always says : " this is our only refuge , baby ... gold .
evety time i look at these engravings ... she' s so beautiful .
where' d you say you got these ?
i didn' t .
a little walking around money .
i guess i' m not walking as far as i thought .
i' m ... sorty .
i can only buy two bricks from you today .
that wasn' t the agreement .
what can i say ?
i' m just middleman .
i' il buy the other two from you on wednesday .
don' t waste my time , yevhen .
so , what does a man with 35 million dollars worth of gold do at night ?
he watches his big ass tv .
that' s our in .
stella .
jesus !
charlie !
how did you get in here ?
i knocked , but you didn' t answer .
what ... so you just let yourself in ?
i was just making sure you were okay .
i apologize .
i just ... i ...
don' t look .
okay .
you got a lot of stuff here .
you know , your dad was old school .
did the whole thing by touch .
that worked for him ; this works for me .
technology guarantees speed and accuracy , you know ?
yeah , but there' s no guarantees in this business , stella .
why the headphones ?
just training myself .
ambient noises , you know , just in case .
what do you want , charlie ?
we' re going to knock out steve' s cable , and we need to send in a repairman .
to get your video blueprint of the interior .
yep .
only problem is steve thinks we' re all dead .
except me .
i' il do it , charlie .
i' m in all the way , whatever it takes .
all right .
i' il set it up .
okay .
um ... you , um ... maybe want to get a drink downstairs with me before i go back to my room ?
i sh ... i should finish this stuff up , you know ?
just get it all done tonight .
yeah .
sorty i scared you .
it' s okay .
good night .
bye .
and then he' s just ... the media darling .
he' s on the cover of all the magazines .
i should' ve been on the cover of wired magazine .
you know what he said ?
he said he ... he named it napster because it it was his nickname ,
' cause of the nappy hair under the hat , but he ... it' s ' cause i was napping when he stole it from me !
he didn' t even graduate .
i think it' s time to move on , don' t you ?
they shut him down .
i wish they' d do the same to you .
here ... here we go .
cable chick .
becky .
nice name ... i wonder what she calls the other one .
and it' s such a mystety why you don' t have a girlfriend , lyle .
so , all we need is a ... service truck like that one , a work shirt like hers .
you think stella can pull it off ?
i have my doubts .
there' s no talking to charlie , though .
you think he' s ... mixing business with pleasure ?
he should know better .
only i' m allowed to do that .
right .
where you going ?
to get a work shirt and a service truck .
are you kidding me ?
how does he do that ?
how do you do that ?
what are you saying ?
hey , how are you ?
oh , good .
i' m good .
nice to meet you , i' m ... handsome rob .
and you are ... ?

yeah , of course .
this way .
you have a really nice house .
yeah .
1922 .
all the original tiles .
evety stone in that courtyard hauled from some monastety in seville .
what a tactic .
monastety ?
monastety for punk ass creeps .
you don' t seem impressed .
no , it' s just that i don' t think lugging a bunch of rocks from one place to another is quite ... that interesting .
you know , it doesn' t quite do it for me .
what does do it for you ?
um ... tvs ?
i have a monster tv .
not working right now , but ... but you know , i should probably check out the cable modem , you know .
yeah ?
yeah , right .
over here .
i paid 30 grand to some punk kid to put this system in .
one day , it just goes out .
i ought to have him strung up .
here we go .
there' s our baby .
we got him .
got any , uh , wiring coming through here ?
there' s no wiring in here .
just right here ?
yeah .
look at that , that' s my ... that' s my nad t770 .
that' s ... that' s my stereo .
i bet most of your customers are pretty surprised when they go to open the door for the cable man and find you standing there .
oh , yeah .
he' s hitting on her .
there' s no problem here .
i should maybe just check the tvs .
okay .
you know what , end this shit right now .
i' m going to blow this shit right off the mountain right now .
no , no , no .
no , no , hey , hey , hey .
i see you got the avm processor .
only the best .
check the box .
i' m just going to ... reset your system .
sometimes these things just get jammed up you know ?
that should do it .
it' s fixed ?
turn her on , let' s see .
now .
japan' s nikkei index ... perfect .
... was the ending price and as you can see , we' ve now gone below ... becky , huh ?
have we met before ? ... a loss of 1 . 1 percent on the ... no , i don' t think so .
if you can just sign there .
so , if i was to ask you out to dinner ... would i be the first one of your customers to ever do that ?
what , you asked your last cable repair guy out for a date ?
no , but the last one was , like , 300 pounds , had a handlebar mustache .
you know , not really my type .
i don' t think it' s a good idea .
why , is that , like , some , cable company rule ?
no , actually , it' s just my rule .
i don' t go out with strange men .
i just met you five minutes ago .
so , i guess i have to , like , sabotage my cable , you know , till we get to know each other well enough .
have a nice day .
come on , i' il be a perfect gentleman , i promise .
i won' t even ask you for your phone number .
i' il just ... i' il meet you .
anywhere you want to go .
come on , break your rule once .
it' s just dinner .
is that a yes ?
are you okay ?
yeah .
he touched my hand .
he came on to me .
hey , at least i ... i created a window of opportunity , right ?
when he goes out friday night , we go in .
by the time he realizes you' ve stood him up , we' il be long gone with that gold .
yeah .
make sure you shuffle them cards this time , left .
hey , lyle , what' s the distance between the front door and the vault ?
don' t deal when my back' s turned .
you' ve got that loser' s paranoia .
lyle !
he only answers to the napster now , charlie .
no .
i' m not calling you the napster .
why not , you call him left ear .
well , i am .
and him , handsome rob .
well , that' s because he is handsome rob .
well , you can call me the napster .
come on , they were at the same college at the same time .
why are you encouraging this ?
it is a verifiable fact ... he was my roommate , he stole my ideas .
i am the napster .
all right , all right .
what is the distance between the front door and the vault , napster ?
it' s farther than you want to carty it .
yeah , but , so , how do we get the gold from the vault to the getaway car ?
how wide is the hallway ... napster ?
six feet .
okay , you' ve got your gold .
whoo !
we need more cars to handle the weight .
looks like i' m going to need some help with the custom work , too .
i know a man for the job .
so i modified the camera to include the ... so we can create really hi res digital maps .
who' s that ?
rob' s mechanic friend .
hey , charlie .

i' m late for my date .
yeah , and you got to be charming .
you' il need him to ask you out again .
sorty .
let' s get out of the street .
i really can' t imagine you doing that .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
well , you don' t really seem
like the adventurous type , you know ?
don' t let the cable uniform , you know , throw you .
i wasn' t making assumptions .
i' ve made some assumptions about you .
oh , really ?
and ?
well ... you' re just going to have to wait and see .
why wait ?
let' s get a check .
let' s go back to my place .
no assumptions ... not tonight .
it' s late .
i should go home .
what , you have a cable company curfew ?
no , but i' ve made some bad calls in the past .
hey .
we should take this maybe a little slower , you know ?
this lovely dinner , sparkling conversation ... you still don' t trust me ?
oh , i trust evetyone .
it' s the devil inside them i don' t trust .
it' s an interesting saying .
it' s charming .
where' d you pick that up ?
can' t remember .
really ?
i knew a guy who said it exactly like that .
really ?
yeah .
he' s the only person i' ve ever heard say that .
he said it all the time .
his name was john bridger .
you' re hurting my wrist .
he had a daughter and she was about your age .
let go of my wrist .
i knew that there was something familiar about you .
you' re exactly like your old man , you know that ?
i liked him , too , right from the start .
i liked him right up until the minute i shot him .
who are you working with ?
she' s with us .
gang' s all here .
you know , the only thing worse than a thief , bendel ?
a coward .
then you should have seen the way your daddy begged for his life .
it' s not worth it .
put a leash on your cat .
hi , steve .
charlie .
not bad , charlie .
really , not bad .
you have no idea how hard it is for me not to reach across this table and kill you with my bare hands .
you know better than that , charlie .
can' t let emotion into these things .
tell me it wasn' t about emotion when you shot john and left us all for dead .
that wasn' t about emotion .
it was about a lot of gold , and i wanted it .
anything you think you deserved , you didn' t .
hey , don' t talk about right and wrong with me , man ,
' cause i just don' t give a shit .
okay ?
you got your cards , i got my cards , we made our play , and i came out on top , okay ?
now if you want to start the game up again , that' s fine with me .
but what , i mean , what is your play here , really ?
i mean , come on , what do you ... what do you think ?
y you' il tty to take out my guards , right ?
i have five of them that you don' t know about .
you' il tty to have lyle hack the system .
i' il change it again tomorrow morning .
what , what , what was y your final move ?
i mean , you were going to have bridger' s daughter come in and tty to crack my safe ?
i mean , that' s ... that' s vety poetic and all , but i just don' t see it .
i don' t think she' il get anywhere near it .
same old steve , huh ?
always thinking defensively .
that' s why you' re always number two .
how do you figure that ?
you got no imagination .
couldn' t even decide what to do with all that money .
you had to buy what evetybody else wanted .
oh ... well , tty this on in your imagination , okay ?
that gold is already gone .
that' s bullshit , steve .
no , really , it' s over charlie .
i' m ttying to move the last two bricks .
you want to come after me over a couple of lousy bricks ?
i mean , really , be my guest .
but you' re off to a bad start , you know ?
' cause you just blew the best thing you had going for you .
you just blew the element of surprise .
surprised ?
it' s over when i say it' s over .
are you all right , sir ?
how you doing ?
good ... considering ... considering the fact that i' m doing all of this for a man i barely knew .
you know what bothered me all those years , charlie ?
it was that , whenever he' d call me to tell me that he was on some job , i knew you were right there with him .
you got to know him a lot better than i did .
just ' cause he was around me more doesn' t mean he wasn' t thinking about you all the time .
be nice if it was true .
it is true .
he always regretted not having been a good enough father to you , stella .
how do you know that ?
because he told me .
what did you do to your hand ?
i punched steve .
why do you get to punch him and i don' t ?
those hands are way too valuable .
hey .
okay ?
there' il be nothing left of that if you keep rubbing it .
tell mr .
frazelli we' il see him at 8 : 00 .
charlie !
he' s flying the coop .
when ?
his security guard called for a private helicopter at 4 : 00 pm .
there' s an armored car service coming to his house at 5 : 00 .
there is a cargo plane scheduled to depart lax at 8 : 00 pm to mexico city .
what if he' s moving the safe as a diversion ?
we crack it , it' s empty , the gold' s somewhere else .
steve' s not about to let that gold out of his sight .
it' s going to be in that truck and he' s going to be watching it evety step of the way from the helicopter .
so the gold' s headed to mexico .
who knows where ?
they could change the flight plan in midair .
slow down , slow down .
you guys are looking at this the wrong way .
this is good news for us .
charlie , what do you mean , " good news " ?
we' ve been ttying to get to the gold in the safe , now the safe is coming to us .
we' re going to boost it in transit .
charlie , it could take a dozen different routes to the airport .
we have no idea which one .
we can' t take out an armored truck during rush hour .
we' re already set up to do it .
napster , gridlock evety route except for the one we choose .
force that truck to go exactly where we want it to go .
where do we want it to go ?
we can' t have a shoot out with armed guards .
we' d lose .
we do it like the italian job .
hello ?
why' d you do it ?
do what ?
yevhen .
you didn' t have to clip him .
whoa , whoa .
what are you talking about ?
we didn' t clip anybody .
yevhen' s cousin is under the distinct impression that you did .
why does he think that ?
because you want to know about the gold with the balinese dancer .
you told him that ?
listen to me , man .
if there' s one thing that i know is never to mess with mother nature , mother in laws or mother freakin ' ukrainians .
look , i need a favor .
