the world is changed .
i feel it in the water .
i feel it in the earth .
i smell it in the air .
much that once was ... ... is lost .
for none now live who remember it .
it began with the forging of the great rings .
immortal , wisest and fairest of all beings .
great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls .
and nine ... ... nine rings were gifted to the race of men ... ... who , above all else , desire power .
for within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race .
but they were all of them deceived .
for another ring was made .
in the land of mordor , in the fires of mount doom ... ... the dark lord sauron forged in secret a master ring ... ... to control all others .
and into this ring he poured his cruelty , his malice ... ... and his will to dominate all life .
one ring to rule them all .
one by one ... ... the free lands of middle earth fell to the power of the ring .
but there were some who resisted .
a last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of mordor .
and on the slopes of mount doom , they fought for the freedom of middle earth .
victory was near .
but the power of the ring ... ... could not be undone .
it was in this moment ... ... when all hope had faded ... ... that isildur , son of the king , took up his father' s sword .
sauron , the enemy of the free peoples of middle earth , was defeated .
the ring passed to isildur ... ... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever .
but the hearts of men ... ... are easily corrupted .
and the ring of power has a will of its own .
it betrayed isildur ... ... to his death .
and some things that should not have been forgotten ... ... were lost .
history became legend ... ... legend became myth .
and for two and a half thousand years ... ... the ring passed out of all knowledge .
until , when chance came ... ... it ensnared a new bearer .
my precious .
the ring came to the creature gollum ... ... who took it deep into the tunnels of the misty mountains .
and there it consumed him .
it came to me .
my own .
my love .
my own .
my precious .
the ring brought to gollum unnatural long life .
for 500 years it poisoned his mind .
and in the gloom of gollum' s cave , it waited .
darkness crept back into the forests of the world .
rumor grew of a shadow in the east ... ... whispers of a nameless fear .
and the ring of power perceived ... ... its time had now come .
it abandoned gollum .
but something happened then the ring did not intend .
it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable .
what' s this ?
a hobbit .
bilbo baggins of the shire .
a ring .
lost !
my precious is lost !
for the time will soon come ... ... when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all .
the 22nd day of september ... ... in the year 1400 ... ... by shire reckoning .
bag end , bagshot row , hobbiton , west farthing ... ... the shire ... ... middle earth .
the third age of this world .
a hobbit' s tale .
by bilbo baggins .
now ... ... where to begin ?
ah , yes ....
concerning ... ... hobbits .
hobbits have been living and farming in the four farthings of the shire ... ... for many hundreds of years ... ... quite content to ignore and be ignored ... ... by the world of the big folk .
middle earth being , after all , full of strange creatures beyond count ... ... hobbits must seem of little importance ... ... being neither renowned as great warriors ... ... nor counted among the very wise .
frodo !
someone at the door .
in fact , it has been remarked by some ... ... that hobbits ' only real passion is for food .
a rather unfair observation ... ... as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales ... ... and the smoking of pipe weed .
but where our hearts truly lie ... ... is in peace and quiet ... ... and good , tilled earth .
for all hobbits share a love of things that grow .
and , yes , no doubt to others , our ways seem quaint .
it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life .
frodo , the door !
sticklebacks .
where is that boy ?
frodo !
down from the door where it began
and i must follow if i can
the road goes ever on and on
down from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone
and i must follow if i can you' re late .
a wizard is never late , frodo baggins .
nor is he early .
he arrives precisely when he means to .
it' s wonderful to see you , gandalf !
you didn' t think i' d miss your uncle bilbo' s birthday ?
how is the old rascal ?
i hear it' s going to be a party of special magnificence .
you know bilbo .
he' s got the whole place in an uproar .
well , that should please him .
half the shire' s been invited .
and the rest of them are turning up anyway .
and so life in the shire goes on ... ... very much as it has this past age ... ... full of its own comings and goings , with change coming slowly .
if it comes at all .
for things are made to endure in the shire ... ... passing from one generation to the next .
there' s always been a baggins living here under the hill ... ... in bag end .
and there always will be .
to tell you the truth , bilbo' s been a bit odd lately .
i mean , more than usual .
he' s taken to locking himself in his study .
he spends hours poring over old maps when he thinks i' m not looking .
where' s it gone ?
he' s up to something .
all right , then .
keep your secrets .
what ?
but i know you have something to do with it .
good gracious me .
before you came along , we bagginses were very well thought of .
indeed .
never had any adventures or did anything unexpected .
if you' re referring to the incident with the dragon , i was barely involved .
all i did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door .
whatever you did , you' ve been officially labeled a disturber of the peace .
oh , really ?
gandalf !
gandalf !
fireworks , gandalf !
gandalf !
fireworks , gandalf !
gandalf ?
i' m glad you' re back .
so am i , dear boy .
so am i.
no , thank you !
we don' t want any more visitors , well wishers or distant relations !
and what about very old friends ?
gandalf ?
bilbo baggins .
my dear gandalf !
good to see you .
111 years old !
who would believe it ?
you haven' t aged a day .
come on , come in !
welcome , welcome .
oh , here we are .
tea ?
or maybe something a little stronger ?
i' ve got a few bottles of the old winyard left .
1296 .
very good year .
almost as old as i am .
it was laid down by my father .
what say we open one , eh ?
just tea , thank you .
i was expecting you sometime last week .
not that it matters .
you come and go as you please .
always have and always will .
you caught me a bit unprepared .
we' ve only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle ....
there' s some cheese here .
no , that won' t do .
we' ve got raspberry jam , an apple tart ....
but not much for afters .
oh , no , we' re all right .
i' ve just found some sponge cake .
i could make you some eggs if you' d
just tea , thank you .
oh , right .
you don' t mind if i eat , do you ?
no , not at all .
bilbo !
bilbo baggins !
i' m not at home !
it' s the sackville bagginses .
i know you' re in there !
they' re after the house .
they' ve never forgiven me for living this long .
i' ve got to get away from these confounded relatives , hanging on the bell all day ... ... never giving me a moment' s peace .
i want to see mountains again .
mountains , gandalf !
and then find somewhere quiet where i can finish my book .
oh , tea .
so you mean to go through with your plan ?
yes , yes .
it' s all in hand .
all the arrangements are made .
oh , thank you .
frodo suspects something .
of course he does .
he' s a baggins ... ... not some blockheaded bracegirdle from hardbottle .
you will tell him , won' t you ?
yes , yes .
he' s very fond of you .
i know .
he' d probably come with me if i asked him .
i think in his heart , frodo' s still in love with the shire .
the woods , the fields .
little rivers .
i am old , gandalf .
i know i don' t look it , but i' m beginning to feel it in my heart .
i feel thin .
sort of stretched ... ... like butter scraped over too much bread .
i need a holiday .
a very long holiday .
and i don' t expect i shall return .
in fact , i mean not to .
old toby .
the finest weed in the south farthing .
gandalf , my old friend ... ... this will be a night to remember .
hello , hello .
fatty bolger .
lovely to see you .
welcome , welcome .
go on , sam .
ask rosie for a dance .
i think i' il just have another ale .
oh , no , you don' t .
go on !
so there i was ... ... at the mercy of three monstrous trolls .
and they were all arguing amongst themselves ... ... about how they were going to cook us .
whether it be turned on a spit , or to sit on us one by one , squash us into jelly .
they spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors ... ... that the sun' s first light crept over the top of the trees ... ... and turned them all to stone !
quickly .
up they go !
no , the big one .
mrs. bracegirdle , how nice to see you .
welcome , welcome .
are all these children yours ?
good gracious , you have been productive .
bilbo ?
sackville bagginses !
quickly , hide !
thank you , my boy .
you' re a good lad , frodo .
i' m very selfish , you know .
yes , i am .
very selfish .
i don' t know why i took you in after your mother and father died ... ... but it wasn' t out of charity .
i think it was because ... ... of all my numerous relations ... ... you were the one baggins that showed real spirit .
bilbo , have you been at the gaffer' s home brew ?
no .
well , yes , but that' s not the point .
the point is , frodo ...
... you' il be all right .
done !
you' re supposed to stick it in the ground .
it is in the ground .
outside !
this was your idea .
bilbo .
bilbo , watch out for the dragon !
nonsense .
there hasn' t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years .
that was good .
let' s get another one .
meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took .
i might' ve known .
speech , bilbo !
speech !
speech !
my dear bagginses and boffins ... ... tooks and brandybucks ... ... grubbs , chubbs ... ... hornblowers ... ... bolgers ... ... bracegirdles ...
... and proudfoots .
proudfeet !
today is my 111th birthday !
happy birthday !
but alas , eleventy one years is far too short a time to live among ... ... such excellent and admirable hobbits .
i don' t know half of you half as well as i should like ... ... and i like less than half of you half as well as you deserve .
i have things to do .
i' ve put this off far too long .
i regret to announce this is the end !
i' m going now .
i bid you all a very fond farewell .
goodbye .
i suppose you think that was terribly clever .
come on , gandalf .
did you see their faces ?
there are many magic rings in this world , and none of them should be used lightly .
it was just a bit of fun .
oh , you' re probably right , as usual .
you will keep an eye on frodo , won' t you ?
two eyes .
as often as i can spare them .
i' m leaving everything to him .
what about this ring of yours ?
is that staying too ?
yes , yes .
it' s in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece .
no .
wait , it' s ... ... here in my pocket .
isn' t that ?
isn' t that odd , now ?
yet , after all , why not ?
why shouldn' t i keep it ?
i think you should leave the ring behind .
is that so hard ?
well , no .
and yes .
now it comes to it , i don' t feel like parting with it .
it' s mine .
i found it !
it came to me !
there' s no need to get angry .
well , if i' m angry , it' s your fault !
it' s mine .
my own .
my precious .
precious ?
it' s been called that before , but not by you .
what business is it of yours what i do with my own things ?
i think you' ve had that ring quite long enough .
you want it for yourself !
bilbo baggins !
do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks .
i am not trying to rob you .
i' m trying to help you .
all your long years , we' ve been friends .
trust me as you once did .
let it go .
you' re right , gandalf .
the ring must go to frodo .
it' s late .
the road is long .
yes , it is time .
bilbo , the ring is still in your pocket .
and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days .
and i' m sure you will , my dear friend .
goodbye , gandalf .
goodbye , dear bilbo .
the road goes ever on and on
until our next meeting .
it' s mine .
my own .
my precious .
riddles in the dark .
bilbo !
bilbo !
my precious .
precious .
he' s gone , hasn' t he ?
he talked for so long about leaving ... ... i didn' t think he' d really do it .
gandalf ?
bilbo' s ring .
he' s gone to stay with the elves .
he' s left you bag end .
along with all his possessions .
the ring is yours now .
put it somewhere out of sight .
where are you going ?
there are some things that i must see to .
what things ?
questions .
questions that need answering .
you' ve only just arrived .
i don' t understand .
neither do i.
keep it secret .
keep it safe .
shire !
baggins !
the year 3434 of the second age .
here follows the account of isildur , high king of gondor ... ... and the finding of the ring of power .
it has come to me .
the one ring .
it shall be an heirloom of my kingdom .
all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate ... ... for i will risk no hurt to the ring .
it is precious to me ... ... though i buy it with great pain .
the markings upon the band begin to fade .
the writing , which at first was as clear as red flame , has all but disappeared .
a secret now that only fire can tell .
shire .
baggins .
there' s no bagginses around here .
they' re all up in hobbiton .
that way .
to heal my heart and drown my woe
rain may fall and wind may blow
but there still be
many miles to go
sweet is the sound of the pouring rain
and the stream that falls from hill to plain
better than rain or rippling brook
is a mug of beer inside this took
there' s been some strange folk crossing the shire .
dwarves and others of a less than savory nature .
war is brewing .
the mountains are fair teeming with goblins .
far off tales and children' s stories , that' s all that is .
you' re beginning to sound like that old bilbo baggins .
cracked , he was .
young mr. frodo here , he' s cracking .
and proud of it .
cheers , gaffer .
cheers .
it' s none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders .
keep your nose out of trouble , and no trouble' il come to you .
good night , lads .
good night .
good night , sweet maiden of the golden ale .
mind who you' re sweet talking .
don' t worry , sam .
rosie knows an idiot when she sees one .
does she ?
good night , sam .
good night , mister frodo .
is it secret ?
is it safe ?
what are you doing ?
hold out your hand , frodo .
it' s quite cool .
what can you see ?
can you see anything ?
nothing .
there' s nothing .
wait .
there are markings .
it' s some form of elvish .
i can' t read it .
there are few who can .
the language is that of mordor , which i will not utter here .
mordor !
one ring to rule them all ... ... one ring to find them ... ... one ring to bring them all ... ... and in the darkness bind them .
this is the one ring ... ... forged by the dark lord sauron in the fires of mount doom .
taken by isildur from the hand of sauron himself .
bilbo found it .
in gollum' s cave .
yes .
for 60 years , the ring lay quiet in bilbo' s keeping ... ... prolonging his life , delaying old age .
but no longer , frodo .
evil is stirring in mordor .
the ring has awoken .
it' s heard its master' s call .
but he was destroyed .
sauron was destroyed .
no , frodo .
the spirit of sauron endured .
his life force is bound to the ring , and the ring survived .
sauron has returned .
his orcs have multiplied .
his fortress at barad dur is rebuilt in the land of mordor .
sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness .
he is seeking it .
seeking it .
all his thought is bent on it .
for the ring yearns above all else ... ... to return to the hand of its master .
they are one ... ... the ring and the dark lord .
frodo ... ... he must never find it .
all right .
we put it away .
we keep it hidden .
we never speak of it again .
no one knows it' s here , do they ?
do they , gandalf ?
there is one other who knew that bilbo had the ring .
i looked everywhere for the creature gollum .
but the enemy found him first .
i don' t know how long they tortured him .
shire !
baggins !
shire .
baggins .
but that would lead them here !
who goes there ?
take it , gandalf !
take it !
no , frodo .
you must take it !
you cannot offer me this ring !
i' m giving it to you !
don' t tempt me , frodo !
i dare not take it .
not even to keep it safe .
understand , frodo ... ... i would use this ring from a desire to do good .
but through me , it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine .
but it cannot stay in the shire !
no .
no , it can' t .
what must i do ?
you must leave .
and leave quickly .
where ?
where do i go ?
get out of the shire .
make for the village of bree .
bree .
what about you ?
i' il be waiting for you ... ... at the inn of the prancing pony .
and the ring will be safe there ?
i don' t know , frodo .
i don' t have any answers .
i must see the head of my order .
he is both wise and powerful .
trust me , frodo .
he' il know what to do .
you' il have to leave the name of baggins behind you .
that name is not safe outside the shire .
travel only by day .
and stay off the road .
i can cut across country easily enough .
my dear frodo .
hobbits really are amazing creatures .
you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month .
and yet , after a hundred years ... ... they can still surprise you .
get down .
confound it all , samwise gamgee !
have you been eavesdropping ?
i haven' t been dropping no eaves .
honest .
i was cutting the grass under the window .
a little late for trimming the verge , don' t you think ?
i heard raised voices .
what did you hear ?
speak !
nothing important .
that is , i heard a good deal about a ring , a dark lord and the end of the world but
please , mr. gandalf , sir , don' t hurt me .
don' t turn me into anything unnatural .
no ?
perhaps not .
i' ve thought of a better use for you .
come along , samwise .
keep up .
be careful , both of you .
birds , beasts .
is it safe ?
never put it on ... ... for the agents of the dark lord will be drawn to its power .
always remember , frodo ... ... the ring is trying to get back to its master .
it wants to be found .
this is it .
this is what ?
if i take one more step ... ... it' il be the farthest away from home i' ve ever been .
come on , sam .
" it' s a dangerous business , frodo .
" going out your door .
you step onto the road , and if you don' t keep your feet ... ... there' s no knowing where you might be swept off to .
sam .
wood elves .
they' re going to the harbor beyond the white towers .
to the grey havens .
they' re leaving middle earth .
never to return .
i don' t know why ... ... it makes me sad .
everywhere i lie there' s a dirty great root sticking into my back .
just shut your eyes ... ... and imagine you' re back in your own bed ... ... with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow .
it' s not working , mr. frodo .
i' m never going to be able to sleep out here .
me neither , sam .
smoke rises from the mountain of doom .
the hour grows late .
and gandalf the grey rides to isengard ... ... seeking my counsel .
for that is why you have come , is it not ?
my old friend .
saruman .
you are sure of this ?
beyond any doubt .
so the ring of power has been found .
all these long years , it was in the shire .
under my very nose .
yet you did not have the wit to see it .
your love of the halfling' s leaf has clearly slowed your mind .
but we still have time .
time enough to counter sauron if we act quickly .
time ?
what time do you think we have ?
sauron has regained much of his former strength .
he cannot yet take physical form ... ... but his spirit has lost none of its potency .
concealed within his fortress , the lord of mordor sees all .
his gaze pierces cloud , shadow , earth and flesh .
you know of what i speak , gandalf .
a great eye , lidless , wreathed in flame .
the eye of sauron .
he is gathering all evil to him .
very soon , he' il have summoned an army ... ... great enough for an assault upon middle earth .
you know this ?
how ?
i have seen it .
a palantir is a dangerous tool , saruman .
why ?
why should we fear to use it ?
they are not all accounted for , the lost seeing stones .
we do not know who else may be watching .
the hour is later than you think .
sauron' s forces are already moving .
the nine have left minas morgul .
the nine ?
they crossed the river isen on midsummer' s eve ... ... disguised as riders in black .
they' ve reached the shire ?
they will find the ring .
and kill the one who carries it .
frodo !
you did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of sauron ?
there are none who can .
against the power of mordor ... ... there can be no victory .
we must join with him , gandalf .
we must join with sauron .
it would be wise , my friend .
tell me ... ... friend ... ... when did saruman the wise abandon reason for madness ?
i gave you the chance ... ... of aiding me willingly ... ... but you have elected the way of pain !
mr. frodo ?
frodo ?
frodo !
i thought i' d lost you .
what are you talking about ?
it' s just something gandalf said .
what did he say ?
don' t you lose him , samwise gamgee .
and i don' t mean to .
sam , we' re still in the shire .
what could possibly happen ?
frodo .
merry , it' s frodo baggins .
hello , frodo .
get off him .
come on , frodo .
what' s the meaning of this ?
you' ve been into farmer maggot' s crop !
you get back here !
get out of my field !
you' il know the devil if i catch up with you !
i don' t know why he' s so upset .
it' s only a couple of carrots .
and some cabbages .
and those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week .
and then the mushrooms the week before .
yes , pippin .
my point is ... ... he' s clearly overreacting .
