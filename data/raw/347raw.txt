leonard adkins is in a warmer clime ... .. with a story that grows hotter by the minute .
security was tight today at escalan airport in valverde , ... .. where government authorities report ... .. that deposed general ramon esperanza ... .. will be delivered for extradition to the united states .
only two years ago , general esperanza ... .. led his country' s army in a campaign against communist insurgents , ... .. a campaign fought with american money and advisers .
esperanza' s fall from power caused ripples ... .. in his country' s recent election , and closer to home as well , ... .. when high ranking pentagon officials were charged ... .. with supplying him with weapons despite the congressional ban .
evidence that esperanza' s forces ... .. violated the neutrality of neighboring countries ... .. made congress withhold funds .
esperanza is accused of replacing the funds ...
.. by cocaine smuggling .
although esperanza was removed as commander in chief this year , ... .. the agreement to extradite him was only reached yesterday .
washington insiders say a phone call made it happen , ... .. a phone call from a ...
all right , all right .
if i could find a phone , i' d call you , whoever you are .
bye .

thank you .

microchips , microwaves , faxes , air phones .
as far as i' m concerned , progress peaked with frozen pizza .
listen , um , we' re going to be about half an hour late landing , ok ?
i just wanted to let you know .
the kids ok ?
they' il lose their minds from all the sugar your parents give them .
did mom give you a hard time about borrowing her new car ?
no .
not yet .
listen , honey , when you land , can we just , like , you know , ... .. rent a car , check into a hotel , leave the kids with your parents ?
order some room service ?
a bottle of champagne , what do you say ?
you' re on , lieutenant .
i' il see you in about half an hour , honey .
i love you .
bye .

my husband doesn' t think so .

you got it .
this is amy nichole , live from escalan airport , ... .. where deposed general ramon esperanza ... .. has just arrived under heavy guard .
the deposed dictator' s mood seems jubilant .
he is waving to the crowd , ...
.. as if running for political office .
.. thousands of political prisoners , including the new president .
there' s no doubt he still has ... .. some ardent supporters both here and abroad .
rumors abound on capitol hill that there were ...
yeah ?
sir , we' re checking our equipment .
any problems with the conduit line ?
i don' t know anything about that .
would you mind if we take a look ?
help yourself .
it don' t seem right somehow , closing down this church .
the parish is going to keep on using it , but it won' t be the same .
been here a lot of years , and i' ve been right here with it .
yeah , i kind of feel like ... .. a piece of me is dying with this church .
well , you' re right about that .
.. cocaine smuggling and bribing government officials .
he certainly doesn' t show it , ... .. but no matter how high his spirits , ... .. they can' t hide the fact that the us war on drugs has taken its first prisoner .
this is buckwheat .
the clubhouse is open .
here at dulles , the quiet men from the justice department ... .. will handcuff the man who symbolizes the enemy ... .. in america' s fight against cocaine .
that battle may be almost won , but the war is still in doubt .

fine .

i accept that .
but why can' t i get the first class meal my network paid for ?
do you know who i am ?
yes .
we' ve seen your program .
your episode , flying junk yards , was an objective look at air traffic safety .
it wasn' t nearly as edifying as bimbos of the sky , was it , connie ?
you think you' re funny .
you think you' re funny .
fine .
i' ve got your number .
and i' ve got yours .
so park it , sir .
fine .
stewardess .
mr thornberg , ... .. you cannot monopolies my time .
you cannot put me near that woman .
excuse me ?
he means he' s filed a restraining order against me .
i' m not allowed within 50 feet of him .
50 yards .
so by keeping me in this section , you are violating a court order .
i can sue you and this airline .
that woman assaulted me , and she humiliated me in public .
what did you do ?
knocked out two of his teeth .
would you like some champagne ?
sorry , officer mcclane .
i had to check .
here' s your piece and shield back .
thanks .
over here , officer !
we understand that there was shooting . .. the presence of justice department officials ?
jesus !
what the fuck are you people ...
what are you doing ?
this is a crime scene .
you got to seal this area off .
that' s up to the captain .
maybe you better take me up to the captain , then , huh ?
where' s cochrane ?
he didn' t make it .
you' re late .
we ran into trouble , colonel .
some cop ... killed cochrane .
i barely got away , sir .
did you accomplish your mission ?
yes , sir , but ...
cochrane , sir .
well , then the damage is minimal .
the penalty could be severe .
you fail me again , and the chamber won' t be empty .
dismissed .
miss .
miss .
i can' t find my dog .
miss .

i want you to fill out this form .

captain lorenzo ?
yeah .
i' m john mcclane ...
yeah , i know who you are .
you' re the asshole that just broke seven faa and five district regulations ... .. running around my airport with a gun , shooting at people .
what do you call that shit ?
self defense .
what , you think that la badge ... .. is going to get you a free lunch or something around here ?
maybe a little professional courtesy .
huh !
in an airport on christmas week ?
you' ve got to be kidding .
ok , fuck courtesy .
how about being professional ?
your boys just walked away from a crime scene .
you can' t wrap this up in ten minutes .
you got to seal the area off , dust for prints ...
hey , don' t lecture me , hotshot .
i know what i' m doing .
we' re going to dust it down .
we' il take all the pictures .
we' il sweep for fibres .

after 400 people go through ?
you' d be lucky to get a print from one of your people .

i don' t need fucking forensics to tell me this was some punk stealing luggage !
luggage ?
that punk pulled a glock 7 on me .
that' s a porcelain gun made in germany .
it doesn' t show up on airport x ray machines ... .. and costs more than you make in a month .
you' d be surprised what i make in a month .
if it' s more than $1 . 98 ...
hey , mcclane , don' t start believing your own press , huh ?
yeah , i know all about you and that nakatomi thing in la .
but just because the tv thinks you' re hot shit , that don' t make it so .
look , you are in my little pond now , ... .. and i am the big fish that runs it .
so you capped some lowlife .

on the top of the transmission ...
on the top of the transmission you just got .
oh , an airport , huh ?
you' re not pissing in somebody' s pool , are you ?
yeah , and i' m fresh out of chlorine .
just as this storm starts breaking , ... .. the satellite will feed up and drop the other shoe .
look at this new front moving in .
makes its baby brother look like chicken shit .
i can sand down the runway and run the ploughs between landings ... .. if you downshift them , give me time to work .
you got it .
all right , everyone .
let' s slow down our birds before we get a parking lot over our heads .
the line starts at the mississippi , ... .. and they better start taking numbers .

i only have to look at his face for another 20 minutes .
ladies and gentlemen , this is the captain speaking .
i' ve just been informed by dulles traffic control ... .. that there' s a weather front ahead of us .
we may be up here a little while longer .
thank you .
on second thoughts ...
al ?
hey , i' m right here , partner .
your stiffs dossier is coming through now .
what can you tell me about him ?
he' s dead .
you needed a computer to figure that out ?
no , no .
you don' t follow me .
according to the department of defense , he' s been dead for two years .
what ?
that' s right .
sergeant oswald cochrane .
american adviser in honduras .
killed in a helicopter accident 5 11 88 .
officer .

i saw the stiff .
word is that was your handiwork .
no .
i only do needlepoint .
great .
national just shut down .
totally iced .
they' il send us their planes .
happy , happy holiday .
the worst part , mr trudeau , was the press .
they were here for the esperanza story , ... .. so they got it right on the fucking news , bloodstains and all .
i' d like to lock every damn reporter out of the airport , ... .. but they' d pull that freedom of speech crap on us .
then the aclu would be all over us .
murder on television .
hell of a start for christmas week .
what is it ?
a gang thing like last time ?
only if your gangs get their training at fort bragg .
who the hell is this ?
uh uh , mcclane .
i' m a police officer ...
in an unauthorized area .
la , mr trudeau , don' t mean shit .
that' s what i said about my last cholesterol test .
so what' s your problem , lieutenant mcclane ?
i' m sure captain lorenzo explained ... .. the minor fracas with the minor thieves .
maybe he can explain this .
all systems tapped , colonel .
fire it up .
h minus five minutes .
stand by .
ok , we' ve got a body in the morgue that seems to have died twice .
assuming it' s not a computer error , what do we assume ?
that somebody' s about to fuck with this airport .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
i know we' re dummies up here , so give us a taste of your genius .
this is a hijacking , a robbery or what ?
look , i' m not sure ...
oh , he' s not sure .
i' m stunned
i got to lie down .
only professionals go to this much trouble .
not luggage thieves and not punks .
professional at what ?
what the fuck do you think this is ?
the safety patrol ?
this is the resume ? of a professional mercenary .
the world' s biggest drug dealer is due here .
you need a slide rule to solve this , ... .. or another body in a bag before you ask questions ?
you' re the one that gave us that fucking body .
remember that .
yeah , i remember that .
lorenzo , have all your shift commanders report in .
now .
you' re not buying into this ? !
they' re to report anything unusual , however trivial .
got that ?
yeah , i got it .
oh , my god !
what ?
the runways .
what the hell ?
they' re shutting down .
jesus christ .
go to emergency lighting now .
emergency .
we are in a code yellow .
backup systems won' t come up .
shunt to another terminal .
bobby , what have you got ?
nothing .
the network is down .
should we call the power company ?
we' re on the same goddamn grid .
we' re hot .
dulles , what' s going on ?
i' m on approach .
maintain position .
repeat .
what' s going on down there ?
roger .
we' re on it .
we' re unable right now .
delay .
fuji 604 .
execute published missed approach procedure and hold .
twa 23 , unable to clear you for approach at this time .
climb to and maintain one zero thousand .
i' ve checked all systems .
it ain' t happening .
yeah , yeah , yeah ...
what' s it look like ?
approach control , it' s gone .
jesus !
instrument landing system is down .
confirmed .
ils is dead .
every goddamn system' s dead .
and inmac monitors are down .
attention all controllers .
attention .
we have a code red alert .
every aircraft approaching our sector ... .. and not already in our landing pattern ... .. gets diverted to their alternate airport .
everyone already on approach or inside our pattern ... .. holds at the outer markers .
stack ' em , pack ' em , and rack ' em .
move .
get someone on it !
all right .
not a word of this leaves this room .
there must be 15, 000 people in this airport , ... .. and we don' t need panic .
we just bought ourselves maybe two hours .
after that , planes low on fuel won' t be circling .
they' il be dropping on the white house lawn .
mcclane , is this what you expected ?
no .
this is just the beginning .
faa hot line .
how could they know already ?
they can' t .
maybe it' s the boys who pulled your plugs .
put it on speaker .
attention , dulles tower .
attention .
they say blind men become very attentive by way of compensation .
now that you' re blind and deaf , i think i' ve got your attention .
i' m aware your recorders are active , so i' il be quick .
you can play me back later to your heart' s content .
how did you get on this line ?
who is this ?
who i am is unimportant .
what i want ...
well , if you don' t want those planes to start splashing into the potomac ... .. as they run out of fuel , what i want is very important .
a plane will be landing at this airport in 58 minutes .
foreign military one .
i' m sure you are aware of the nature ...
esperanza ? .. of this flight , the importance of its cargo .
this plane will not be met by anyone .
it will land on a runway of my designation , ... .. where it will remain isolated and unapproached .
that will conclude my interest in this aircraft ... .. and your responsibility for it .
at the same time , i want a 747 cargo conversion , ... .. fully fueled ... .. and placed at my disposal .
you have two more minutes to advise inbound aircraft ... .. to hold at their outer radio marker .
after that , you will be able to receive only .
any attempt to restore your systems , will be met ... .. by severe penalties .
he' s bluffing .
damn it , you can' t do this .
i am doing this .
ok , listen up .
i need you to punch up a code 15 .
i got an idea , and i need your help .
if esperanza gets to a country ... .. with no extradition treaties , we' re fucked .
they' re talking to us on our own system .
they got to be close .
my men will tear this airport apart .
just in the nick of time , huh ?
i got a first class unit here , swat team and all .
we don' t need any monday morning quarterbacks .
my wife' s on one of the planes they' re fucking with !
so i' m on the playing field .
if you' d have moved your fat ass before , we wouldn' t be deep in shit now .
that' s it .
security .
you' re out of here .
mr trudeau , there are faa regulations ... .. regarding unauthorized personnel in the control tower !
we just have to find a way to transmit .
somebody want to run to radio shack for a transmitter ?
we have one the terminal wing they' re building .
20 airlines when it' s done , ... .. all with reservation computers in a nice antenna arrangement .
see mr mcclane out .
you got no business being up here .
everything we need is by the annexe skywalk ... .. just sitting there , waiting to go on line .
goddamn it , trudeau , you' re dealing with pros .
you can' t fuck with these people !
sam coleman .
wntw news .
there are a lot of rumors flying around .
no way .
no way , lady .
hell , no .
no .
this is off limits , coleman .
get them out of here !
anything you can think of , they' il think of , too !
get your fucking hands off me .

big drug dealer on his way to prison .

that' s who he was .
who he who ?
what ?
hey ...
shh !
it' s ok , i' ve done this before .
hey .
hi .
where' s the other one ?
claustrophobic , i guess .
it' s a vhf system , but the planes are so close , it' s ok .
i can rig our frequency in 30 minutes , and wire in a crossover .
even the planes wouldn' t know the difference .
get what you need .
borrow .
steal .
kill .
i want my swat team to go with him as cover .
whatever we can think of , they can think of , too .
oh , man .
i can' t fucking believe this .
another basement .
another elevator .
how can the same shit happen to the same guy twice ?
# old cape cod
# if you like the taste of a lobster stew
# served by a window with an ocean view
# you' re sure to fall in love with old cape cod

i' m marvin .
marvin .
i' m marvin .
i thought you was trying to steal my records .
i' m just the janitor .
this is dulles approach to all aircraft ... .. holding at potomac vortex .
we are experiencing some technical problems .
weather conditions , which have deteriorated ... .. have now been complicated by an unforeseen human factor .
this has affected all of our electronic equipment ... .. and their redundant backups .
as a result , our nav and approach systems are down .
we expect to lose voice in another minute .
we want you to continue ... .. holding at the outer marker as directed ... .. and wait for further instructions .
as soon as we' re back on line , ... .. we' il expedite your landings on a fuel emergency basis .
good luck .
god bless .
ok , change the boards .
hey , stand back .
the skywalk annexe .
no !
the annexe skywalk .
it' s the last thing i heard before they kicked me out .
well , let me see here , now .
well , this must be it right there .
see ?
that' s the raised platform and there' s the new terminal .
there' s your skywalk .
goddamn bottleneck .
nice place for an ambush .
what' s the fastest way you can get me out to that spot ?
this kind of thing wasn' t in my job description .
mr barnes , we' il watch your back .
yeah ?
who watches yours ?
main ventilation duct .
ventilation duct ... .. and bingo .
just once , ... .. i' d like a regular , normal christmas .
eggnog , a fucking christmas tree , ... .. a little turkey .
but , no !
i got to crawl around in this motherfucking tin can !
we' re in the annexe skywalk .
i can see the array .
i' il give you a call for a protocol test when it' s hot .
that' s all for now .
sergeant , we need more equipment .
i' d like to send one of your guys for it .
right , sir .

ugh !
i' m going to kick your fucking ass .
jeez .
you all right ?
yeah .
but the antenna array , ...
i got to get to it and set it up .
get down !
bait .
jerk us off .
make lorenzo sacrifice his best men .
make you waste your time , ... .. time we don' t have .
i think you' re closer than 50 yards .
so' s that airplane .
practically .
yeah .
there' s quite a few of them .
it looks like a regular traffic jam .
there' s nothing regular about it .
see ?
you' re intrigued .
that' s my gift , mrs mcclane .
i notice things .
things other people wouldn' t see .
that' s how i make people curious .
don' t you mean nauseous ?
look .
the people have a right to know everything about everybody .
you got in the way of that .
listen , buster .
you endangered my children .
you didn' t do it for anything as noble as the people .
the only time you see the people , ... .. is when you look down to see what you' re stepping on .
me ?
yeah , i' il live .
but lorenzo' s swat team is dead , ... .. and the antenna array is gone .
didn' t you see it ? !
it' s hard looking for a new miracle .
hold for a minute .
i' il be right back .
hold for a second .
something' s going on .
yeah .
just hold on for a minute .
i say again , annexe team , give us a sit rep .
annexe team , come in .
do you copy ?
it' s got a scrambler on it .
can you do anything with it ?
no .
this scramble mode must activate on this code panel .
even if we scan their frequency , we can' t listen in .
these guys are pros .
so are you .
break the code .
i want to hear what these bastards are saying .
this is a ten digit control panel .
six digit read out .
hell , there could be a million combinations .
next time you kill one of these guys , get him to enter the code first .
yeah .
sir , we just monitored a call from their chief engineer .
we took out their swat team , completely .
you were right .
they went for the antenna array .
we' re on schedule .
losing our team wasn' t part of the plan .
attention , dulles tower .
attention , dulles control tower .
mr trudeau , i know you' re listening .
unfortunately , you' re not obeying .
try me face to face .
you were warned not to restore your systems .
you' ve wasted lives and precious time on a futile and obvious target .
now you' re going to pay the penalty .
i' ve got five dead officers , colonel stuart .
isn' t that penalty enough ?
mcclane , keep out of this .
you' ve been a pain ...
oh , mcclane .
john mcclane .
the policeman hero who saved the nakatomi hostages .
i read about you in people magazine .
you seemed out of your league on night line .
hey , colonel , blow me .
how much drug money is esperanza paying you to turn traitor ?
treason is merely a matter of dates " .
this country' s got to learn it can' t keep cutting the legs off ... .. of men like general esperanza .
men who have the guts to stand up against communist aggression .
and lesson one starts with killing policemen ?
what' s lesson two , the neutron bomb ?
no .
i think we can find something in between .
watch this .
give me a flight number .
one that' s low on fuel .
windsor 114 .
transatlantic from london .
fuel tank' s dry as a martini .
activate the ils landing system , but re calibrate sea level ... .. minus 200 feet .
oh , jesus !
they' ve reset ground level , minus 200 feet .
windsor flight 114 .
this is dulles approach .
do you copy ?
dulles approach , this is windsor 114 .
where the devil have you been ?
windsor 114 .
we' ve been right here all along , old buddy .
our systems have only just came back on line .
windsor 114 , you are cleared for ils approach , ... .. runway two niner .

windsor 114 , stand by ...
what are you going to do ?
whatever i can .
ladies and gentlemen , we' ve started our descent .
we' re sorry for the inconvenience , ... .. but we' il all be on the ground shortly .

we' re just like british rail , love .
we may be late , but we get you there .
don' t worry .

dulles , this is windsor 114 inside the outer marker .
roger , 114 .

jesus !
aagh !
we' re going to die !
we' ve got you .
god .
motherfucker .
motherfucker .
oh , jesus .
that concludes our object lesson for this evening .
if the 747 we requested is ready on time ... .. and general esperanza' s plane arrives unmolested , ... .. further lessons can be avoided .
out .
we got no sign of survivors down here .
it' s a goddamn nightmare .
hey , nelson !
come here .
barnes !
we' ve got to warn those planes there' s a lunatic pretending he' s the tower .
get me on the air .
how ?
you figure it out !
here' s the manifest .
mcclane , i know how you must feel .
i wanted to help those people .
i was pretty goddamn useless .
we called the government for help .
they' re going to send in a special army unit .
a counter terrorist team .
your wife' s plane ...
they' re still broadcasting , even though we can' t answer .
they' re going to run out of fuel in 90 minutes .
listen , dick .
that is your name
dick .
if you' re going to continue to get this close , ... .. could you switch after shaves ?
anything else ?
stronger mouthwash might be nice .
and here' s sam coleman reporting live from the accident .
colonel , they' ve done everything we' ve anticipated ... .. so far .
but still there has been no official word .
despite the fact that only one runway has been closed due to the tragedy , ... .. several dozen airliners are visible , endlessly circling the field .
other reports say there was trouble in the tower before the crash ... .. and that that may have contributed to it .
with weather conditions worsening , ... .. the problem here and in the sky will grow .
i' m samantha coleman at dulles international airport .
victor .
victor .
victor .
yeah , what' s up ?
did you pack the radio mikes from the shoot or are they here ?
i wouldn' t let those assholes check them in !
i love you .
give me one of the receivers .
can you tune into the cockpit frequency ?
yeah .
why ?
i want to hear what' s going on .
should be right here on our band .
nothing .
you said it would work .
is it working or not ?
it is working , but all i' m getting is some kind of airport beacon .
it' s weird .
it' s like the tower isn' t there .
stay on it .
let me know when there is something there .
ok .
major grant .
we' re blue light .
rollins , department of justice .
trudeau , chief of air operations .
lorenzo , terminal police .
you want something , you got it .
this is it ?
one fucking platoon ?
one crisis , one platoon .
who are you ?
john mcclane .
mcclane , you showed some balls out there , man .
yeah .
now show some good sense .
let the pros handle this .
i think the pros are on the wrong team tonight .
isn' t colonel stuart one of your men ?
no , not anymore , he' s not .
we' re here to take colonel stuart down .
and we will take him down .
i served with him .
i taught him everything he knows .
well , maybe he' s learned a few more things since then .
let' s hustle !
the command post will be set up in the airport police station .
i want to be tied into the tower in 15 minutes .
all right , let' s do it !
hey , trudeau .
did things just get better or worse ?
lights .
big , portable lights .
we set up the field , and then we ...
wait for those lunatics to shoot them out ?
where do we get those lights ?
what about the air phone idea ?
there' s 18 planes up there .
only five of them have those phones .
we got through to three .
we' re trying the others .
that' s 13 potential accidents .
are they still bucking head winds ?
head winds are slamming everybody over the outer marker .
the planes with enough fuel ... .. have been shunted to atlanta , memphis and nashville .
outer marker .
damn !
the outer marker !
it' s a beacon , right ?
it sends out this beep beep beep ... .. so they know they' re over it .
so ?
who says that signal has to beep ?
we switch the frequency from the tower to the one in the beacon .
we pump up the wattage .
we can talk to our planes , and those bastards who did this won' t know !
traced the signal .
found it in the luggage area .
they' ve been tapped into your tower chatter all night .
punks stealing luggage , huh , carmine ?
how you doing , telford ?
no good .
i called lang .
they' il have a portable decoder here in two hours .
my wife doesn' t have two hours .
i was put on grant' s team yesterday .
the regular guy got appendicitis .
word is , nobody' s better at this than major grant .
attention !
except maybe colonel stuart .
i want to hear about the plane those bastards asked for .
then i' il fill you in on my orders .
pilots ' briefing room .
now !
keep working .
albertson .
with me .
no civilians .
what the fuck ... ?
what is it ?
the outer marker beeper .
it isn' t beeping .
it' s talking .
attention , all aircraft in dulles landing pattern .
this is chief engineer , leslie barnes .
i have been authorized to brief you in full .
at this time , this is the only channel available to us .
here is the situation .
approximately two hours ago ...
get a load of this .
do not accept instructions claiming to be from our tower ... .. unless you hear your flight recorder access code .
the terrorists have got all ...
holy shit ! .. our systems and ...
get this on tape ! .. have control of everything except this channel .
give us a second here , please .
this channel is secure .
your own transmissions are not .
do not attempt to reply on your own frequencies to this broadcast .
these people have already caused one crash ...
.. by impersonating our tower .
jesus .
repeat .
the terrorists have cut off ... .. the two systems that allow you to land : field lights for a visual landing and the ils for an instrument .
a special us army unit is here , preparing to take out the terrorists .
my god .
don' t accept any instructions ...
yo , marvin .
hey , you interested in a nice coat ?
no .
it never looked good on me anyway .
you' ve got to get me to the pilots ' briefing room .
i' ve got to hear what they' re saying .
which map gets me in there ?
don' t touch it !
don' t touch it !
find the map , marvin .
i' il find it .
you' il mess up my whole damn filing system .
pilots ' briefing room , i think that' s in the main terminal .
so would that be under p for pilots ' briefing room ?
now , marvin !
or maybe under m for miscellaneous .
oh , shit !
request permission to reduce sentry duty to 30 minute rotation .
my men are getting cold and antsy .
over .
this is colonel stuart .
assemble the men not on watch for a briefing .
roger .
what' s the matter ?
oh !
gentlemen , ... .. tonight the pattern ends .
the dominoes will fall no more , ... .. and the ramparts will remain upright .
sir , general esperanza' s plane is on the scope .
attention , dulles tower .
we will be lighting up a runway .
do not , repeat , do not attempt to land any planes .
remember , we' re monitoring you .
what do we do ?
obey .
dulles tower to foxtrot michael one .
dulles tower ... .. to foxtrot michael one .
this is foxtrot michael one , dulles .
we read you .
over .
foxtrot michael one , you are to come in on runway ... .. 1 5 , repeat , 1 5 .
i found it on the floor , by the coat , next to the luggage belt .
what the hell you so excited for ?
the code' s still punched into this one .
you like it , huh ?
how about giving me 20 bucks for it ?
how about i let you live ?
the man knows how to bargain .
this is contrary to our instructions .
we are to land at runway 1 0 , ... .. where we are to be met by representatives of your justice ...
captain , please tell the tower you will proceed as ordered .
roger , dulles .
proceeding to runway 1 5 .
foxtrot michael one .
come in , please .
what are you going to do now ?
are you going to shoot me ?
so who will fly the plane ?
don' t worry about it .
it' s not your problem .
michael one .
do you copy ?
foxtrot michael one .
come in , please .
eagle nest .
this is falcon .
mayday .
eagle nest .
this is falcon .
mayday !
go ahead , falcon .
i' ve lost cabin pressure .
near zero visibility .
i must drop out of this weather and land now , ... .. on the first accessible runway .
repeat .
i' ve lost cabin pressure .
near zero visibility .
i must drop out of the storm .
i can land , but i must land now , on the first outgoing runway .
repeat .
i cannot circle around to runway 1 5 .
i' il make you a deal , marvin .
show me a shortcut to those runways , ... .. and i' il get you a liner for that coat .
repeat .
i cannot circle around to runway 1 5 .
stand by , falcon .
here , sir .
he' s coming in from the ocean .
a bullet has damaged my instruments .
i' m not sure of my bearings , ... .. and i must make a visual landing immediately .
do you copy , eagle nest ?
roger , falcon .
that would be 2 5 right .
repeat .
2 5 right .
make up your fucking mind !
we are just up to our ass in terrorists again , john .
affirmative .
2 5 right .
over .
2 5 right .
i' ve got to quit smoking cigarettes .
thank you for telling me , eagle nest .
but if you could show it to me as well , ... .. i would be grateful .
i see the lights .
they are directly in front of me .
gracias , compadre .
reducing air speed .
approaching runway .
wish me luck .
roger , falcon .
we copy .
we' il have you in five minutes .
that' s right , asshole .
we' il have you in five minutes .
i see your lights .
eta 90 seconds .
come to papa , scumbag .
oh , shit !
no !
freedom .
not yet .
you should stay in your seat until the plane reaches the terminal .
no frequent flier mileage for you .
who are you ?
a cop .
a cop ?
yeah , one of the good guys .
you' re one of the bad guys .
now i' ve got your sorry ass , i' m going to trade it for my wife .
sit down !
go in !
where did he go ?
in there .
i don' t believe this .
two months of planning , ... .. and you can' t anticipate one pendejo of a cop .
come on , general .
where is colonel stuart ?
general !
i' m all right .
he said he was a policeman .
i thought you had this place secured .
he went in the cockpit .
he' s going to hell !
mcclane !
i assume it' s you , mcclane .
you' re quite a little soldier .
you can consider this a military funeral !
aaagh !
how many grenades we got ?
three each !
use them !
oh , fuck .
go !
aaagh !
oh , shit !
you lucky fuck .
fire trucks , sir .
fall back to the church .
now !
where' s the fucking door ?
they' re getting a little nervous back there .
in fact , so am i.
we' re over washington .
see if you can get any tv to settle them down .
works for me .
i' il ...
writing your acceptance speech for the video sleaze awards ?
try pulitzer .
ladies and gentlemen , ... .. while waiting to land , we are turning on local washington tv .
the sound is on channel three .
ok .
ok , ok .
please , sir , we may land at any moment .
if you' il take your seat ...
i' m going to be sick .
i' m going to be sick .
sir , the seat belt light is on .
moron .
wzdc .
this is richard thornberg .
put me through to ruben in the newsroom .
he' s about to go live .
i know he is .
that' s why i need him .
you' il have to hold on ...
put me through , celia , or start typing your resume .
esperanza' s down , ... .. but he' s hurt .
he took a round in his shoulder .
i got one more of their guys .
that' s six they lost altogether .
if we knew how many they had to start with , we could get excited , ... .. but if they got 50 guys , it' s a little early to open the champagne !
we appreciate your effort , but we don' t need a loose cannon here !
what if they crash another plane in retaliation for your stunt ?
they can' t do that now , right , barnes ?
besides , if i grabbed esperanza , this would be over now .
maybe they' re more creative than you think !
well , at least i' m thinking , goddamn it !
we' re here to jerk off that cock sucker until he tries to take off .
period !
you' re the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time !
the story of my life .
major !
pentagon situation room , sir !
pentagon .
i' il take it in here .
thank you , telford .
you men come with me .
mcclane .
yeah , barnes .
you said those guys showed up right away ?
yeah .
that means they' re on the field or close .
and i think i know where .
let me show you something .
these are the old plans with the longer runways .
that' s 12 years ago .
looks like they' ve modified the site , ... .. moved tra con phones , ils , all the underground stuff ... .. so they could handle drainage .
if i' m right , ... .. it would run along the airport property ... .. and go right past this neighborhood .
we should have landed two hours ago !
i understand , but if you just relax ...
it' s hopeless .
somebody ought to get their ass kicked for this mess .
unfortunately , there isn' t anyone we can blame for the weather .
oh , yeah ?
what about that porker , willard scott ?
i should have taken the bus .
at least they can pull over for food and gas .
excuse me .
yes ?
i was just wondering .
this flight originally was supposed to be 5 half hours , right ?
mm hmm .
do we have enough fuel to keep circling like this ?
oh , of course .
they anticipate little problems like this .
we looked at 12 fucking houses , and we' re nowhere .
this is our last possibility .
over here there' s an old church .
let' s go .
wait .
there' s the church over there .
could be a sentry .
he could just be out for a walk .
then why is he going over his own footsteps ?
come on .
all right .
stay here and get ready to call the marines .
i thought they were the army .
who gives a fuck ?
just be ready .
oh , shit .
lorenzo , it' s barnes .
where the hell did you go ?
where' s mcclane ?
with me , at the hidey lake church , to the west of the airport .
where ?
goddamn it !
you crazy idiot , why didn' t ...
this must be their operations base .
shut up and get your ass here !
code red !
sitrep .
we got positive id on stuart' s location .
let' s move .
yo !
our escape plane will be ready within 30 minutes , general .
if there are no more surprises .
gentlemen , we have a situation here .
aagh !
ugh !
over here .
jeez , mcclane , you all right ?
you want a medic ?
what the hell you think you' re doing , playing john wayne ?
how would you like to spend the night in a cell ?
lorenzo , shut the fuck up and do something useful .
go seal off the street .
hey , you can' t talk to me like that .
oh , no , carmine ?
sergeant , get this bureaucrat out of mr mcclane' s face now .
with pleasure , sir .
major , the men are in position , sir .
close up the back .
then we go in .
fire only on my order .
roger that , sir .
guess i was wrong about you .
you' re not such an asshole after all .
no , you were right .
i' m just your kind of asshole .
garber , sit rep !
army special forces on three sides , closing in fast around the back !
another problem , colonel ?
no problem , general .
gentlemen , you know what to do .
down !
get down !
get down !
general , ... .. it' s time .
come on , let' s move it !
they' re pulling out ... at the back !
what ?
move it !
albertson , take your men around the back .
aagh !
aagh !
this equipment could land our planes .
there are trip wires .
they could have booby trapped ...
they did .
got one here , too .
looks like c 4 .
the motherfucker is armed .
clear the area !
everybody , now !
they booby trapped all the equipment .
seal off the building !
shit !
post sentries .
no civilians allowed .
hey , where the fuck is mcclane ?
miller , take him !
i' il cover you !
aagh !
so much for the element of chance .
let' s move out .
i had the bastard in my sights .
i know i did .
oh , jesus christ .
attention .
attention , dulles tower .
this is colonel stuart .
is our plane prepared ?
it is .
it' s in hangar 11 .
it' s the most remote building we' ve got .
we' re on our way .
have a ground crew there to confirm the condition of the plane .
do you believe the balls on this son of a bitch ?
colonel , you' re quite capable of confirming it yourself .
don' t ask us to gift wrap potential hostages for you .
major grant , isn' t it ?
if you remember me , colonel , ... .. then you remember i know the drill as well as you do .
check out your own fucking plane .
we move out in five minutes .
flak jackets for everybody .
body armor for the assault team .
night scopes for the snipers .
we will take them in the hangar , and i will pull that detonator ... .. out of stuart' s dead fucking hand myself .
lorenzo , take all your men back to the airport .
seal off every exit , ... .. in case they try to slip past us to break out onto the ground .
you got it .
all right , here we go .
this is nuts !
every station has people at the airport , ... .. and no one has heard a whisper of this shit !
none of them is me .
you want proof , try this .
repeat .
terrorists have murdered civilians ... .. and cut off the two systems that can allow you to land .
a special us army unit is here , preparing to take out the terrorists .
jesus christ .
i want you to go live now .
get me in from the files .
a publicity shot .
the maps , steal one from weather .
we' re on it .
we' re cutting in five minutes !
tell the affiliates if they want in , they got three minutes to shout .
let' s do this .
network , here i come .
telford , what was your chicken shit outfit doing ... .. while we were taking grenada ?
grenada .
five minutes of fire fight , five weeks of surfing .
i wish i was with you guys for that .
yeah .
me , too , kid .
really , sir ?
sure .
then we wouldn' t have to do this .
eagle nest , this is hatchling .
on schedule ... and in position .
roger , hatchling .
we are secure here .
you have a green light .
i repeat , a green light .
ugh !
jesus , officer , where did you come from , ... .. pearl harbor ?
all right , let' s clear it out , please .
stand by .
five , four , three ... this is a special bulletin from wzdc news .
there has been a plane crash at dulles , where other aircraft still circle , ... .. with no explanation from airport or faa officials .
and now , with an exclusive wzdc report , ... .. here' s dick thornberg reporting from the skies over washington .
i' m one of the thousand people who has been circling our capital ... .. under the assumption that whatever problem there was below was a normal one .
but the truth is far from normal .
the truth is terrifying .
look out !
lady , look out !
look out !
look out !
look out !
look out !
get out of the way !
get out of the way !
get out of the way , lady !
go , go !
hey , hey , look out !
this is a recording of a conversation ... .. between dulles tower and a captive aircraft overhead .
get out of the way !
lorenzo !
are you out of your fucking mind ?
where' s the blue light team ?
stuart' s rigged explosives to a remote .
where' s grant ?
they' re going to kill that son of a bitch and get it from them !
no , they' re going to take off on that plane with him !
get the fuck out of here !
when the army canned stuart , he loaded that unit with his men !
are you nuts ?
that fire fight ...
sideshow to buy him some time .
mcclane , you are completely around the fucking bend .
you' re under arrest , motherfucker .
these are the bullets they used out there tonight !
blanks !
jesus christ .
this is chief lorenzo .
i want every officer recalled and in body armor and full weaponry ... .. in the motor pool in five minutes .
it' s time to kick ass .
just like iwo jima !
we have learned that the terrorists have control of the airport , ... .. a fact that the authorities have repressed .
the terrorists promise more bloodshed unless their demands are met .
now that the special army commandos have arrived at the airport , ... .. the likelihood of a full scale battle is dangerously close .
that stupid , arrogant son of a bitch .
it' s all over the airport .
300 people have died ...
when are we going to land ? .. and unfortunately , they may not be the last .
the horrifying fact is that no one is safe , ... .. either in the planes above dulles or in the terminal below .
the threat of a new and higher body count at the airport ... .. hangs over the heads of everyone , ... .. and the holiday season of peace and love has become a nightmare .
all right , listen up !
all units , i want you to converge on hangar 11 , ... .. all sides !
this car , mcclane !
get in !
when the city blue show up with their backup , ... .. they' il pick up the pieces !
now , move out !
mcclane , say hi to my brother vito .
merry christmas .
hi .
goddamn it to hell !
move that piece of shit !
will you move that goddamn piece of shit ... .. out of here ?
vito , get the fuck out of the car !
get your ass in gear and help me !
will you get ... ?
move that car right now !
right there .
get that .
hey , coleman !
sam !
sam coleman !
hey , coleman !
hi !
coleman !
.. but at least the truth is not among the hostages ... .. because i , richard thornberg , just happened to be here ... .. to put his life and talent on the line for humanity and country .
if this should be my final broadcast ...
amen to that , ...
dick .
dick ?
we' re live , dick .
where are you now ?
dick ?
truck lights approaching , sir .
they' re here , right on schedule .
the hangar door , open it .
clockwork .
jeez , you give me this story , and i' il have your baby .
not the kind of ride i' m looking for .
colonel , if i may say so , you are some piece of work .
thank you , major .
you' re not so bad yourself .
congratulations on your escape , sir .
thank you , major .
save them until we are all safe , hmm ?
sir .
my congratulations , gentlemen .
you' ve won a victory for our way of life , ... .. my pride , my admiration , and a kick ass vacation .
now , get on board .
what' s the matter , cowboy ?
ride too rough ?
i don' t like to fly .
then why are you here ?
i don' t like to lose , either .
ok , whoa !
here we go !
i don' t know about you guys , ... .. but i' ve seen enough fucking snow to last me a lifetime .
you don' t get much of that in the tropics .
for you gentlemen , we' il import it .
shit !
they left the hangar !
right there .
right there .
get that .
now what ?
get in front !
take it down !
block their path so they can' t get out !
i' m not playing chicken with a 200 ton plane !
i' m crazy , but i ain' t that crazy .
forget it .
dulles , this is northeast 140 .
request clearance to land .
that' s holly' s plane .
repeat .
request emergency clearance .
i know you won' t answer , but you better listen !
we' re down to fumes , and we have to land .
in five minutes , we' re coming in .
that' s my wife' s plane !
take it fucking down !
i' m not getting in front of that plane !
all right , how about getting over top of it ?
this is the captain .
your attention .
we have no choice but to attempt an emergency landing .
fasten your seat belts and assume crash positions ... .. as instructed by your cabin attendants .
let' s have the emergency check list .
attention , all air traffic in dulles area .
this is northeast 140 .
we are attempting an emergency landing .
be advised .
i don' t want to die .
i don' t want to die .
i don' t want to die .
just buckle your seat belt .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
lean forward .

# but the fire is so delightful
# and since we' ve no place to go
# let it snow , let it snow , let it snow
# it doesn' t show signs of stopping
# and i brought some corn for popping
# the lights are turned way down low
# let it snow , let it snow , let it snow
# when we finally kiss goodnight
# howl hate going out in the storm
# but if you' il really hold me tight
# all the way home i' il be warm
# the fire is slowly dying
# and , my dear , we' re still goodbying
# but as long as you love me so
# let it snow , let it snow , let it snow
# when we finally kiss goodnight
# howl hate going out in the storm
# but if you' il really hold me tight
# all the way home i' il be warm
# the fire is slowly dying
# and , my dear , we' re still goodbying
# but as long as you love me so
# let it snow , let it snow , let it snow
