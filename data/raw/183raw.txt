mr. shen , please .
you could be in a great deal of trouble .
halfa city block explodes in a ball of green flame , and there are people who say you' re involved , thatyou might be responsible , thatyou' re a very dangerous man .
now , ifyou' re protectingjack burton
you leave jack burton alone !
we are in his debt .
he showed great courage .
ok .

iike , uh , you really believe in magic ?
you mean chinese black magic ?
yes .
oh , absolutely .
areyou still serious about this ?
and , uh , monsters and ghosts as well , i suppose ?

this isjack burton in the pork chop express , and i' m talking to whoever' s listening out there .
like i told my last wife , i says ,
i never drive faster than i can see , besides , it' s all in the reflexes .
youjust listen to the old pork chop express and take his advice on a dark and stormy night .
when some wild eyed , eight foot maniac taps your favorite head up against a barroom wall and asks you ifyou' ve paid your dues , rememberwhat oldjack burton always says at a time like that . " haveyou paid your dues, jack ?
yes , sir .
the check is in the mail .
i' m not saying that i been everywhere and i done everything , but i do know it' s a pretty amazing planet we live on , and a man would have to be some kind of fool to thinkwe' re all alone in this universe .

the man' s still got 100 bucks .
i won' t complain .
i' d have lost my shirt soon .
it breaks my heart to do this , but next time i' m down here , you' il gang up on poor oldjack .

i' m going to marry her, jack .
oh , god !
i' ve known her since we were kids .
i haven' t seen her in fiveyears .
i worked my fingers till they bled .
i saved every nickel to bring her here .
i can' t eat or think properly without her anymore .
she' s going to put my life in order .

long time ago , chinese men with gold rush fever flooded into california , what we call mountain of gold ,
ieaving behind theirwives and children , working foryears to complete the transcontinental railroad , saving all their pennies , and then they sent for their families to help build this beautiful chinatown you see outsideyourwindow this fine warm day .

i don' t even know what that means .
all i know is , this lo pan character suddenly appears in the middle of an alley , and hejust stands there waiting for me to drive my truck through him !
jack , please !
hello .
hello .

it didn' t , uncle chu .
yeah , it did .
tall guy , weird clothes .

lo pan appeared on the street ?

money and time are important to me .
your phone is dead .
i lost a girl .
the lords of death werejoyriding , not acting on any orders from the wing kong .
theywanted a girl .
miao yin was there .
that skirmish happened because lo pan ordered the boss of the chang sings assassinated .
that was his funeral .
it was a war .
don' t panic .
it' s only me , gracie law .
great .
just passing through the neighborhood ?
this is my neighborhood .
sure , it was a war .
anybody there went to the hell of being cut to pieces .
hell of what ?
chinese have a lot of hells .
why is gracie law here ?
she can' t get enough of me .
you know i' m always poking my nose where it doesn' t belong .
this mix up is my fault , sort of .
but i heard those punks thatjumped me took the girl they kidnapped to the white tigers for a quick sale .
who was she ?
my fiancee .
the white tigers ?
ifwe get there tonight , we can buy her back .
a search warrant' s too complicated .
hold it .
i' m feeling like an outsider .
you are .
jack , i need more help .
i can' t payyou today .
i need cash for miao yin .
it' s gonna cost .
she' s got green eyes .
oh , no .
that' s an extra to these people .
what people ?
look , this lo pan i ran over through ... has spirit medium powers .
his flesh and his bones are atomized .
he becomes a dream .

mrs. o' toole will take care of your needs .

i' m in the mood for a girl with green eyes .
price is no object .
i like them fresh off the boat .

green explosions , people flying around ?
that was not real .
i want to talk to the cops .
where am i ?
my office .
you sleep in your office ?
these guys i mean , these storms
what are they , magicians ?
sort of .
it' s hard to explain .
try hard .
here .
drink .
they' d only take miao one place .
lo pan .
yes .
the godfather of little china ,
david lo pan .
the owner of the wing kong lmport/ export trading company , who' s so reclusive no one' s seen him in years ?
who areyou ?
i' m margo litzenberger .
i' m with
i' ve been trying to get somebody , anybody from the press to listen to me about this .
you couldn' t have seen lo pan .
he' s hiding .
he' s got enemies
i' m getting miao yin back .
who' s that ?
it' s ok , tara .
you can go back to sleep .
from the airport .
sure .
i was protecting her civil rights , making sure she gets a chance .
this isjust so shocking .
i must be monumentally naive .
you are .
now we have to grabyour fiancee
i' m a reasonable guy , but i' vejust experienced unreasonable things .
somebody , i don' t care who , tell me what is going on .
the truth ?
i can take it .
we don' t know .
i' m going now !
where ?
it' s pouring out .
the wing kong exchange .
the most dangerous den of madmen in chinatown ?
you can' t waltz in there
like the wind .
i can .
as two .
i' m coming .
i' d go , but
i know .
there' s a problem with your face .
sit tight .
keep the home fires burning .
ifwe' re not back by dawn , call the president .
this is gonna take crackerjack timing , wang .
total concentration .
you ready, jack ?
i was born ready .
i love working nights !
don' t get up , don' t get up .
phone company .
boys , where' s the minipanel at ?
probably through here , huh ?
wang .
good work, jack .
i think they actually fell for it .
yeah .
hey .
last time , the problem was caused by squirrels chewing through the wires .
where' s that central junction box ?
i think it' s down there .
what does that say ?
hell of boiling oil .
you' re kidding .
yeah .
it says keep out .
we' ve got to do something .
hmm .
goat butts against the edge , and its horns become entangled .
i haven' t had the pleasure .
miss gracie law , mr. egg shen .
egg' s our local authority on lo pan .
he' s helping us out .
how ?
it' s been two hours .
let' s beat down the door .
no .
we have to gather our strength .
now there' s clouds and thunder ...
the image of difficulty at the beginning .
mmm .
but finally we shall bring order out of chaos .
look .
yeah .
whatyou got here is two people dragging a third .
miao yin .
you did that , right ?
i guess so .
i hope so .
jack , check this out .
what is this , chinese or something ?
counting backwards ?
not backwards .
downwards .
of course the chinese mix everything up .
lookwhat they' re working with .
there' s buddhism , confucianism , and taoist , alchemy and sorcery .
we take what we want and leave the rest , just like your salad bar .
but there' s one thing even david lo pan must acknowledge .
all movement in the universe is caused by tension between positive and negative furies .
when the furies are out of balance ...
as in lo pan , who is cursed ...
the people turn into immortal demon ...
an evil existing only to plague the living .
well , then , whatyou' re saying is ,
david lo pan what is he , a ghost ?
he plays at being a man .
a creature of vast , dark , destructive power .
we' re out this hatch and up the cables .
is that brilliant , orwhat ?
the cable is three stories high and covered with grease .
it' s real .
at least we know where we stand .
yeah , in deep shit .
what ?
what the hell ?
shit !
did you think they' d let us walk in like the wind ?
that was your damn point !
my point was to find miao yin and get your truck back !
i' il buy another one !
there' s only one miao yin !
jesus christ !
where are we ?
hell of the upside down sinners !
hiya !
uh !
uh !
uh !
hey , you .
come on over here and fight like a man .
oh , shit, jack .
i don' t like the looks of this .
where are we , wang ?
you are nowhere !
oh , boy .
look , we came here to see david lo pan .
ah ?
david lo pan .
you have succeeded , mr. burton .
what , you ?
i don' t get this .
i thought lo pan
quiet !
you are not on this world to " get it .
lo pan is like
nothing you can understand .
there are many mysteries , many unanswerable questions , even in a life as short as yours .
we should still ask .
like , where' s my truck ?
you are looking for a girl with green eyes .
yes !
she must be something extraordinary .
oh , i' m not about to waste another 2, 000 years .
there aren' t many chinese girls with green eyes .
there neverwere .
beggars can' t be choosers .
i can !
tell me about miao yin , huh ?
what province is she from ?
hunan ?
her mother , her father ?
he must be a holy man .
you got a tongue , dave .
ask heryourself .
mr. burton , ifyou have influence overyouryouthful friend , exert it now !
otherwise , you will both be brought to the hell where people are skinned alive !
areyou crazy ?
is thatyour problem ?
he means it .
my problem is this place .
this place is my tomb .
i' m buried here .
ayoung man , a king , a warrior , is entombed in this old man' s crippled body .
and all i need is a woman , mr. burton a special kind of woman with dragon green eyes to make me whole again so i may rule the universe from beyond this grave .
ching dai , god of the east .
who , him ?
not me .
my demon .
the god i must appease in order to regain my heart , my blood .
a girl with green eyes to satisfy ching dai , a girl brave enough to embrace the naked blade .
i will marry her .
never !
my curse will be lifted !
you' il rule from beyond the grave .
indeed !
or check into a psycho ward , huh ?
jack , will you
i' m supposed to buy this shit ?
2, 000 years , and he can' t find one broad to fit the bill ?
there have been others , to be sure .
there are always others .
you seem to know the difficulties between men and women , how seldom it works out .
and yet , we all keep trying , like fools .
who are these people ?
friends of yours ?
this really pisses me off !
come on , stick around .
where' s miao yin ?
in this building ?
safe .
where !
saferwith me than any creature on earth .
go ahead , give us the runaround .
go ahead , give us the runaround .
but this woman has a deadline , and her pen is mightier than your sword .
no visitors .
i don' t make the policy .
come on , man .
give them a tour .
what' s it gonna hurt ?
ha , ha , ha !
i can helpyou .
you ok, jack ?
yeah .
we' re in a room , no windows , a few skeletons .
where' s the light coming from ?
the floor .
with the easing of trade restrictions ...
nextyear , we will start importing strange things from peking .
what sort of strange things ?
are we going up or down ?
it feels like down .
great .
great .
thankyou, jack .
i thinkwe' ve come up .
first we went down , then they brought us up .
two , three feet thick .
probablywelded shut and covered with brick .
that' s ok .
let' sjust chew ourway out .
lo pan has plans for us .
which lo pan ?
the basket case on wheels or the tall roadblock ?
they' re the same .
you know something you' re not telling me , wang .
myths and legends .
i don' t want to insultyou .
no , go ahead .
insult me .
it' s about all sorts of scary things
an ancient army of the dead , the spirit city , and monkey sacrifices and the first emperor of china , that mad monarch who federated our seven warring states , defeated lo pan , and imposed upon him that curse of no flesh in 272 b. c.
chinese hear these things when we' re kids .
then we grow up ... and pretend not to believe them .
no horseshit , wang ?
no horseshit, jack .
i don' t blameyou .
i' m chinese , and i don' t even want to believe it .
but it' s for real sorcery , chinese black magic .
blindfolds !
you make one move
ahh !
ahh !
now , let' s try that again .
don' t make me kill you .
come on !
come on, jack !
come on !
how ?
hhhhhhh !
ohhhh !
aaah !
aah !

hey , i' il tradeyou .
which way ?

yaah !
no pathetic excuses .
i smell the blood of human beings .
find them !
boil them until their flesh falls off .
you heard me !
empty .
oh , miao yin .
i need you , miao yin .
you , whose eyes flash like emerald lightning .
ching dai ... make me flesh again soon ... please .
let' s go .
it' s clear .
safety .
oh , yeah .
wang !
aah !
first time you ever plug somebody ?
of course not .
come on !
do we want to go up or down ?
up or down ?
up !
all has become ... strange .
a world so unreal and yet , at once so frightening .
open up !
open up or i' il blow his head off !
open !
and your souls be with his to the hell of the holy dragon .
you all right ?
yeah .
margo .
jack !

would you stop rubbing your body against mine ?
because i can' t concentrate when you do that .
oh !
i mean really .
where' sjack ?
it' s ok .
everybody relax .
jack , i know where we are .
this is like a central
sewer ?
yeah .
water comes in up there .
seawater from the bay .
fills this room , then diverted to different chambers .
i bet it' s where we first got on that elevator .
all right .
we' re almost out of here .
from here on , it gets pretty normal
offices , storerooms a nice false front .
i count to three .
i open that door .

that' s it .
you' ve probably got a best seller on your hands .

cops got better things to do than get killed .
uagh !
