youre no hero , boyd .
i want you as far from my company as possible .
im sending you to california
fort spencer .

captain john boyd .
war hero , huh ?
so, the brass decided to reward you ... with a little appointment to the california sun ?
have a walnut , boyd .
martha brought them in fresh from san miguel .
this is my hobby ... reading in the original languages ...
well, you know , languages in general .
its , uh ...
its tedious , i know ... but, then , this place thrives on tedium .
so , uh ...
you have a hobby , boyd ?
swimming .
swimming .
i hope you dont mind hard water .
so ...
fort spencer .
uh, the spanish built this place as a mission .
we inherited her .
now were a way station ... for western travelers on their way through the nevadas .
we dont get much traffic ... through these parts in the winter ... so we maintain only a skeleton company ... that consists of private toffler ... whos our personal emissary from the lord ...
major knox, who never met a bottle he didnt like ...
private reich hes our soldier .
aaah !
id steer clear of him .
and martha youve met .
bet you didnt get a word out of her .
and george , her brother .
theyre both locals sort of came with the place .
ha !
ha !
ha !
and then theres private cleaves .
the overmedicated private cleaves .
and you and i make eight .
cleaves cooks .
knox used to be a veterinarian , so he plays doctor .
my advice to you is dont get sick .
id tell you dont eat , but then most of us have to .
so, with your promotion ... youd be number three in command .
tofflers prayer .
o heavenly father , bless this to our use , and
amen .
amen .
so , did anyone do anything today ?
we have a great sense of camaraderie ... here at fort spencer .
how did you get behind the enemy line ?
i froze .
i was scared .
scared ?
you froze while the rest of your unit fought and died ?
what did you do then ?
i played dead .
but you made it behind enemy lines .
i was buried ...
with my commanding officers ... half shot off head in my face ... his blood running down my throat .
so , how did you take the command post ?
something ... something ... had changed .
were going to promote you , boyd .
we could shoot you ... but as you single handedly captured the enemy command ... it might set a bad precedent .
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa .
last minute addition to the post .
all right , cleaves .
lets hear it .
salt , meat , beans ... coffee , oil ... bacon, flour .
all right .
i want you back in three days .
no loco weed ... no peyote ... no women .
no women .
martha , keep him out of trouble .
ok .
nice trip .
all right , come on .
ya !
im going to get up ... some salt , meat , beans ...
ioco weed , and women .
no women .
i cant get a woman ?
wish you were along for the ride ?
unh !
what did you get the medal for ?
cowardice .
uh ... knox has got some excellent bourbon .
its really fine stuff .
and he just passed out about ... a minute ago .
so , uh ... wondering if youd like to ...
he wont mind ?
probably .
to escape ... in one form or another .
toffler !
toffler !
uh huh ?
what are you doing ?
oh , um , its a religious hymn .
im writing a religious hymn .
ah .
well , could you find some inspiration somewhere else ?
and could you get us some ice ?
funny thing .
we escape the world ... we come here ... and then we turn right around and try to escape this place .
frightening thing about escape, though
the chance you might end up someplace worse .
hmm .
reich , go that way .
colonel .
yeah ?
who are you ?
reich !
reich !
hes alive .
jesus christ .
just barely .
lets get him inside .
uh, we need hot water .
uh , george, toffler , hot water !
lots and lots of hot water !
reich, try to rouse knox .
lets get these rags off .
lets see if we can get his blood moving .
toffler , more water !
i think heil live .
easy , easy , easy .
well , hes warm .
frostbite didnt seem to do much damage .
i guess the only thing we can do is let him rest .
and , uh ... pray .
toffler, your duty .
good work .
each one of these is about one point five miles .
takes about three days actually , because ...
mm hmm .
mm hmm !
yes ?
hes up .
excellent .
hes up .
lets go .
major ... major knox ?
major knox ?
major knox ?
doc ?

hes going to tell us what ...
hes going to tell us what happened .
doc ?
where , uh ...
where am l ?
fort spencer , california .
western sierra nevadas .
excuse me .
im sorry .
my name is colqhoun .
f. w. colqhoun , servant of god .
how are you feeling , mr. colqhoun ?
not bad , considering .
i probably look like death .
not bad ... considering .
how long were you out there ?
three months .
without food ?
yes .
toffler , help him .
good lord .
good lord .
you should have seen me three months ago .
i was thirty pounds heavier .
relch : lm sorry , but you did say no food for three months .
i said ...
i said no food .
i didnt say there was nothing to eat .
do you understand ?
do you understand ?
i suppose i owe you gentlemen a story .
only if you feel up to it .
yes .
we left in april .
six of us in all .
mr. maccready and his wife from lreland .
mr. janusfrom virginia , i believe ... with his servant, jones .
myself imfrom scotland .
and our guide ... a military man , coincidentally .
colonel lves .
i dont think i know him .
the better for you .
a detestable man ... and a most disastrous guide .
he professed to know ... a new , shorter route through the nevadas .
quite a route thatwas .
longer than the known one ... and impossible to travel .
get up there !
get on !
we worked ... very, very hard .
by the time of the first snowfall ... we were still a hundred miles from this place .
that was november .
proceeding in the snow was futile .
we took shelter in a cave .
we decided to wait until the storm had passed .
butthe storm did not pass .
the trail soon became impassable ... and we had run out of food .
we ate the oxen ... all the horses ... even my own dog .
and that lasted us about a month .
after that , we turned to our belts ... shoes ... any roots we could dig up ... but you know theres no real nourishment in those .
we remained famished .
the day that jones died ...
i was out collecting wood .
he had expired from malnourishment .
and when i returned ... the others were cooking his legs for dinner .
would i have stopped it had i been there ?
i dont know .
but i must say ... when i stepped inside that cave ...
the smell of meat cooking ...
i thanked the lord .
i thanked the lord .
and then things got out of hand .
i ate sparingly .
others did not .
the meat did not last us a week ... and we were soon hungry again .
only this time , our hunger was different .
more ... severe ... savage .
and colonel lves , particularly , could not be satisfied .
janus was the first to be killed .
then mr. maccready .
that left colonel lves ...
maccreadys wife , and i alone ... and i knew in that company that my days were numbered .
im ashamed to say that i acted in a most cowardly manner .
it would have been nobler , i know ... to have stayed and protected mrs. maccready from lves , but ...
i was weak .
i fled .
it was nothing less than pure providence that i arrived here .
mrs. maccready is she still there ?
and colonel lves , as far as i know .
lets pack up .
weve gotto go upthere .
weve gotto go .
its our job .
why go ?
its our job !
heres you .
heres toffler .
reich has got his own rifle .
ive got my pistol .
i thinkthe caves three or four days march from here .
what is it , george ?
what ?
weendigo .
weendigo .
weendigo .
hart, translatlng : lts an old lndian myth from the north .
a man eats anothers flesh .
its usually an enemy .
and he , um, takes ... no , steals ... his strength , essence , his spirit .
and his hunger becomes craven ... insatiable .
and the more he eats , the more he wants to .
the more he eats , the stronger he becomes .
george , people dont still do that , do they ?
white man eats the body of jesus christ every sunday .
time !
major knox, were leaving now .
youre going to be in charge until i return .
heres the key to the arsenal .
martha and cleaves will be back in a few days .

will he be all right ?
yeah , heil befine .

how do you stop it ?
you dont !
you ever give yourself ?
weendigo eats .

he he takes !
never , never gives .
you stop weendigo ... you give yourself .
you must die .
theres no sign of anyone .
no sign of a sign of anyone not colonel harts rescue party , not the original party .
you found the cave ?
theres nothing in there !
theres nothing inside .
theres no blood tracks ... no rope , no bodies .
you dont believe me , sir ?
we have four missing soldiers , captain , and no bodies .
we need a supportable explanation .
now, your story, this ... windagee ... is the stuff of campfires .
would you stop squirming , lindus ?
i know i mispronounced it .
im making a point .
my point is , captain , we need facts , not myths .
i told you the facts , sir .
boyd , if you altered your story now ... it wouldnt be perceived as retracting a lie ... only ... clarifying , um , a muddled recollection .
the day that we spoke to you ... you were out of your head with fever .
i was coherent then , lm coherent now , sir ... and i distinctly remember
perhaps up there in the wilderness ... you got separated from your company .
thats why lm giving you this second opportunity .
i advise that ... you change your story , boyd .
whos that ?
new colonel .
a pleasure to meet you , sir .
why dont we go inside ?
yes ?
the colonels here .
thank you , lindus .
weve brought in an interim commanding officer ... until we can appoint a permanent replacement for colonel hart .
captain, this is colonel lves .
colonel , captain boyd .
captain .
hows the leg ?
lindus ?
lets step outside .
now, what is the matter with you , captain boyd ?
its him , sir .
its who ?
its him , sir .
who is ?
hes colqhoun , sir .
colonel lves is ?
hes the one that that killed them all , sir .
are you mad ?
have major knox look at him .
sir , major knox was here .
major knox .
have major knox look at him , sir .
major knox .
major knox .
he doesnt look familiar to me , sir .
i do remember the man wore a beard .
but , as i was saying , sir ...
i was feeling a bit ill that day .
you were drunk .
captain , please .
boyd, you say you fired on this colqhoun ... struck him in the shoulder .
well, that would leave a wound , now, wouldnt it , general ?
i presume so .
well, why dontwe check , hmm ?
colonel lves .
general .
would you humor me a moment ?
of course , sir .
would you ...
would you take off your shirt , please ... and show me your shoulder , please , colonel ?
please .
well , i , uh ...
my last physical examination was ... was not that long ago .
surely major knox has no desire to hear me cough .
the other shoulder , please , colonel .
thank you , colonel .
not at all .
is there a problem ?
notwith you , colonel .
general, we should leave now in order to avoid the storm .
boyd told the general colonel lves killed everyone .
what ?
he said colonel lves was the man responsible .
boyd gone loco .
i think hes the reason nobody come back .
i have to warn you .
yeah , captain ?
consider yourselves warned .
do you need this ?
no , sir .
oh , good .
youre not an eater of ribs , colonel lves ?
no , no , major .
i , uh ... can neverforget it used to be an animal .
sentimental fellow .
what about you , captain boyd ?
you dont eat meat ?
oh , no , he wont .
only as a last resort .
thats a pity .
oh ...
yeah .
unh !
boyd , no !
ha ha ha !
damn .
ahem .
checkmate .
ha ha !
aah !
huh .
well, well ...
it appears a number of us could use some rest .
go on to bed , boyd .
clearing up .
i found your private reich out there ... or what was left of him .
you didnt finish .
well , i cant blame you .
he was tough .
but then ... a good soldier ought to be .
you know , notthat long ago , i couldnt do that .
could barely take a breath without coughing up blood .
tuberculosis .
that , along with ... fierce headaches ... depression ... suicidal ambition .
i was in pretty horrible shape .
infact ...
i was on my way to a sanatorium to convalesce ... more likely to die ... when en route, this lndian scout told me a curious story .
a man eats the flesh of another ... he steals his strength .
he absorbs the other mans spirit .
well ...
i just had to try .
consequently , i ate the scoutfirst ... and, you know , he was absolutely right .
i grew ... stronger .
later, through circumstance ... my wagon train grew lost in the rockies .
ive heard this story before .
mmm .
i atefive men in three months .
tuberculosis ?
vanished ... as did the blackthoughts .
i reached denver that spring feeling ... happy .
and healthy .
and virile .
did you eat her, too ?
well , as a matter of fact
youre disgusting .
here i am , one year later ... feeling more alive than ever before .
and thats what surprises me about you , boyd .
youve tasted it ... felt its power .
yet, youre resisting .
why ?
because its wrong .
ah !
morality ... the last bastion ... of a coward .
well , lm sorry .
im sorry .
did i offend you ?
you remember this ?
you smell it ?
scent always jogs the memory , dont you think ?
you remember the energy ... the potency of someone else coursing through your veins ... someone brave .
you know the disappointment as it dissipates ... the strength ... slipping from your grasp ... the growing , killing need to replenish .
but i dont have to remind you of that .
youre feeling it right now .
i am going to kill you .
he die, you die .
what in heck is going on out here ?
i was on my way to the latrine .
boyd attacked me .
hes a liar !
hes lying !
boyd , lm putting you under arrest .
martha , go wake up cleaves .
put boyd under arrest .
cleaves ?
cleaves ?
cleaves ?
cleaves !
you find cleaves ?
no .
you check around outside ?
no .
well , check around outside, woman !
cleaves ?
cleaves ?
cleaves ?
oh ... oh !
major knox !
major !
major !
what ?
all the horses ... dead !
what ?
killed !
oh , good gracious .
unh !
that was for cleaves ... and this is for my horse .
martha ...
colonel lves and i have agreed ...
boydil be moved to a military prison as soon as possible .
one of us must travel to san miguel by foot ... to get general slauson .
volunteers ?
safe travel to you , martha .
oh ...
knox ?
major knox ?
knox !
major knox !
major knox !
knox !
talk to me .
id like to know youre still alive .
be quiet , boyd .
good gracious .
colonel lves .
my sword is missing .
ives : lm sorry , major ?
my sword in the parlor , above the fire .
i havent seen it .
what are you cooking ?
its , uh ... stew .
you need any help ?
no , no, though ... perhaps later, you might ... contribute .
you let me know .
boyd : lves .
ives !
yes ... captain ?
when did you do it , lves ?
do what , captain ?
kill cleaves and the horses .
i was watching you the whole time .
you be quiet about cleaves and the horses , boyd !
you hear me ?
or i will putyou out again .
well , howd that door come open ?
thatil do it .
good gracious .
knox ?
knox !
hello , boyd .
i hated doing that .
unh .
i told you my regimen had certain curative powers , boyd .
get him up and around .
oh ... oh !
leg still hurt ?
doesnt have to, you know .
you killed cleaves ... and the horses .
what happened to you ?
i thought i was dead .
i remember feeling panic as my life slipped away .
it was like drowning in darkness ... and then ... there was nothing .
and then i woke up ... and lves was feeding me .
by the time i regained my senses ... there was no turning back .
i feel terrific .
so, youre going to kill me ?
no .
no .
its lonely being a cannibal .
tough making friends .
no , i like you , boyd .
we , uh, want to bring you into the fold .
you gotto eat .
finished ?
ives : lm afraid major knoxs penchant for bourbon ... didnt leave him in the pink .
you take over .
manifest ... destiny .
westward expansion .
you know , come april ... itil all start again .
thousands of gold hungry americans ... will travel over those mountains ... on theirway to new lives ... passing right ... through ... here .
we wont kill ... indiscriminately .
no ... selectively .
good god ... we dont want to break up families .
people are not stupid , lves .
really ?
youil get caught .
well , if its just the two of us ... jolly old hart and l .
you see , thats why we need others .
you, for one .
general slauson .
of course, weve no wish to recruit everyone .
weve enough mouths to feed , as it is .
we just need a home .
and this country ... is seeking to be whole .
stretching out its arms ... and consuming all it can .
and we merelyfollow .
not me .
you know , its not courage to resist me , boyd .
its courage to accept me .
i mean , youre already one of us .
well ... almost .
you hunger for it .
you justwont resign yourself to it .
its not so difficult , really ... acquiescence .
its easy , actually .
you just ... give ... in .
i cant .
oh, well .
then ... you die .
its all right , its not fatal .
not if you take the necessary precautions .
stew a la major knox .
this will fix you up .
the old souse was a lot stronger than he looked .
a couple of doses of this ... youil be right as rain and twice as strong .
well ...
isntthis civilized ?
mmm .
you know ...
ben franklin once said ...
eat to live ... dont live to eat .
huh ?
huh ?
its an easy decision , boyd .
you can either famine or feast .
live or die .
bravo .
here , chickie , chickie , chickie .
run away !
run for your lives !
having fun ?
morning .
the generals coming , remember ?
well , youre up .
feeling better ?
waste not, want not .
ben franklin .
hows the wound ?
oh , right as rain .
yeah .
so it is .
i could use some fresh air .
are you to be trusted ?
of course not .
walnut , boyd ?
all my books are gone .
iil miss them .
plato, aristotle .
for two millennia , struggling with the nature of man ... the ideal society ... morality .
boil it down ... its the same issues ... we cant solve today happiness and how to achieve it .
aristotle sought truth , colonel , not happiness .
truth ?
ha !
i led my whole life according to what ...
i thought was right and true , and look where it got me
fort spencer .
come on , general .
you have to let me go now , sir .

lm still having nightmares .
oh , no , no .
reich , cleaves , knox .

i dont want to hear this !
theres no turning back now !

all you have to do is kill !
you have to kill to live !

you have to do me a favor before you go .
