george , wake up .
it' s saturday .
i know , but it' s the first day of soccer .
it' s our first game .
soccer ?
i can' t today .
i caught a cold while sleeping .
you' il be fine .
come on , come on , it' il be great .
we' re going to play like brazilians .
here you go .
thanks , mom .
stuart , don' t forget your water bottle .
george ....
don' t forget your cleats .
you look especially beautiful today .
some people just know how to wear oatmeal .
okay , open up .
did you hear that ?
she said " blah blah .
i can' t believe it .
her first word .
where' s the baby book ?
i' m writing it down .
i' m not sure that' s technically a word .
of course it is .
but your uncle crenshaw says that every little starts talking by nine months .
in uncle crenshaw' s case , never stops .
are you both coming to the game ?
wouldn' t miss it .
frederick ... ... this soccer game' s making me very ....
proud ?
anxious .
especially about ....
i' m fine .
he' s fine .
all those boys stomping around with cleats .
what if someone ....
oh , honey .
he' s a little .
all littles are natural athletes .
do you need ....
could you ?
okay , that' s it for you .
snow , food .
food ?
is it tuna ?
or herring ?
or , dare i say it , is it lox ?
oh !
please be lox !
that' s for you .
boys , are we ready to play some soccer ?
you bet , dad .
oh , great .
it' s glop .
look what i' m reduced to .
i' m a handi wipe with hair .
wallace !
get up !
there we go !
that' s right !
dig !
dig !
go downfield !
downfield !
you guys , spread out !
spread out !
well , george is getting a workout .
what bothers me is that every kid has had a chance to play except stuart .
there' s plenty of time .
plenty of time ?
there' s 40 seconds .
he did an excellent job of handing out the orange slices .
that' s not as easy as it looks .
okay , i' m glad he' s not in the game .
i don' t want him to get hurt .
it' s pee wee soccer .
nobody gets hurt .
irwin , are you okay ?
are you all right , irwin ?
do i look all right ?
here .
come on .
better substitute .
tie game .
we could play with just 10 .
but we have george , so it' s like having nine .
we' il have none of that .
come on , coach .
stuart !
go in for irwin !
mom !
dad !
i' m going in !
yeah , stuart !
oh , dear .
watch your tail out there .
don' t worry , i won' t let you down .
now , go get them .
let' s go , let' s go !
come on !
over here !
i' m open !
i got it !
i got it !
i' m going to snatch him off the field .
honey , honey .
knowing boys as i do , i think he might find that a little ....
embarrassing .
get it , george !
go after it !
pass me the ball , lame o .
come on .
george , shoot !
i got it !
i got it !
shoot !
i got it !
i got it !
yeah , i did it !
i have to start wearing a cup .
he just looked so small out there .
so lacking in bigness .
does he really have to go back next week ?
we have to give him room to grow .
i do .
i let him slice his own banana .
with a spoon .
i let him drive his car to school .
no other mother does that .
with george walking beside him every step of the way .
how much more room should i give him ?
a bit more than you' re giving him now .
maybe mom was right .
maybe i shouldn' t be playing soccer anymore .
what does she want you to go out for ?
painting or dancing .
i guess it' s my fault .
i' m sorry i kicked you into the goal .
that' s okay .
you won the game .
that' s the main thing .
no .
the main thing is i hit wallace in the face .
bogeys , 12 : 00 !
i got him , brooklyn !
wouldn' t it be cool if i actually flew this ?
yeah .
there' s only one problem .
mom .
hello , mrs. little .
hi , will .
ls george home ?
he' s with stuart .
we just need to tighten her up and she' s ready to fly .
hi , george .
hi , stuart .
hi , will .
you want to take a break for a while ?
i brought my ps2 .
yeah , okay .
but what about the plane ?
i want to play with will for a while .
play with snowbell .
oh , well .
guess i' il have to finish it myself .
if i can just ....
oh , dear .
hey , what' s that noise ?
sounds like a lawnmower .
inside the house ?
stuart !
what are you doing ?
i' m not doing anything !
pull the brake !
get the book !
this is cool .
all my brother does is jam crayons up his nose .
it says , " on takeoff , pull back on the throttle .
takeoff ?
i' m in the air !
snowbell , get out of the way !
please , don' t hurt me !
what' s going on ?
stuart' s just flying in the house .
flying in the house ?
at least he' s indoors , nothing bad can happen .
watch out !
hit the dirt !
stuart !
duck !
are you all right ?
are you okay ?
i' m okay .
everything' s fine .
fine ?
stuart , you destroyed it .
i' m sorry i wrecked it , george .
i' m sure we can fix it with some glue .
no , we can' t .
that' s going in the trash .
it' s much too dangerous .
thanks , stuart .
why don' t you take the boys home ?
i think stuart and i need to have a talk .
good idea .
come on , boys .
let' s go home .
she treats me like a baby .
i' il fix you both some lunch .
she just loves you so much .
it' s hard for her to think ofyou in danger .
oh , this has been a bad day .
mom' s mad , george won' t play with me ....
i know .
but every cloud has a silver lining .
doesn' t that make them kind of heavy ?
no , it' s an expression , stuart .
the thing about being a little is that you can look at any situation ... ... no matter how bleak , how hopeless ... ... and still see the bright side .
the silver lining .
like in this situation , the silver lining would be ....
help me , dad , because i' m struggling .
george has found a newfriend .
so you could find a newfriend , too .
you' re a lot better at this than i am .
i' ve been a little a lot longer than you have .
you' il get the hang of it .
meantime , keep your chin up ... ... your back straight and your heart open .
then what ?
one step at a time .
and canada is separate from the united states because ... ... canadians like to be alone .
review tomorrow , test on friday .
and please take your leftover lunches with you .
my husband is tired of me coming home smelling like salami .
tony , would you like to come over to my house this afternoon ?
sorry , pal .
i' ve got karate .
hey , mark .
guitar lessons .
some of the guys are going over to will' s house to play basketball .
can i come ?
they didn' t exactly mention that you were invited .
oh , that' s okay .
i' m busy anyway .
just tell mom i walked you home .
i owe you one .
sure .
whoa !
miss ?
miss ?
are you alive ?
she' s alive .
out of the way , please .
injured bird coming through !
what' s going on ?
my wing .
where am i ?
hey !
where' s the falcon ?
what falcon ?
that falcon !
drive !
get out of here !
oh , my !
get lost , you disgusting vulture !
eat my feathers , you vile buzzard !
do we really want to antagonize him ?
oh , boy , we' ve got a problem .
no , you can make it .
don' t slow down .
you did it .
yeah .
i did .
so , who do i have to thank ?
forgive me .
my name is stuart .
stuart little .
i' m margalo .
just margalo .
margalo .
you' re so strong .
are you an athlete ?
well , yeah .
i play a little soccer ... ... fly airplanes ... ... race boats .
you can put me down now .
my legs are fine .
it' s my wing that' s hurt .
oh .
yeah .
of course .
there used to be bandages in here .
hey , why don' t we try your scarf ?
good idea .
my pin , it' s ....
must have happened when that falcon smashed into me .
it was part of our nest when i was a baby .
i' ve had it my whole life .
it' s the only thing i have left of my mother' s .
gee , that' s too bad .
yeah .
there .
how' s that ?
that' s much better , thank you .
so tell me , stuart little , do you actually live here ?
oh , yeah .
i' m a real little .
i' m the middle child .
the middle little .
cute .
so , where do you live ?
you know , here and there .
you mean you don' t have a home ?
once , we lived in a box .
well , not really a box .
it was one of those things where people keep their jewelry .
a jewelry box ?
yes !
that' s what it must have been .
a jewelry box .
it was wonderful .
well , i' ve taken too much of your time .
i' d better go before it gets dark .
no , wait .
you can' t go out there .
not while you' re hurt .
you should stay here .
i couldn' t impose .
i mean , you' d really do that for me ?
sure , i have just the thing .
i' il be right back .
meanwhile , you can use my cat' s bed .
you have a cat ?
don' t worry about snowbell .
he wouldn' t hurt a fly .
those flies really come back on you .
i try to eat right and yet i still feel bloated .
maybe more food will help .
hi there .
sorry .
didn' t mean to scare you !
scare me ?
that' s a laugh .
hear that ?
that was a laugh .
hairball .
major hairball .
and yet we continue to lick ourselves .
unbelievable .
hey , snowbell .
meet margalo .
she' il be staying with us for a while .
staying ?
are you out of your mind ?
you can' t just drag stray birds in here .
do you think this is a halfway house ?
look , she' s filthy .
no offense .
she could have germs .
and how do you know she' s not a vagrant or a thief ?
get rid of her .
we' re home .
sorry we' re late .
little hi , little low .
little hey , little ho .
what the heck was that ?
that' s just how we greet each other .
interesting .
nauseating is more like it .
you' re in for it now , missy .
mother little hates when animals walk in here off the street .
when she sees this , she' s going to throw a fit .
such a pretty little birdie .
maybe it' s just my friends she hates .
i found her .
found me ?
he saved my life .
he did ?
from a falcon .
what' s that ?
stuart saved this little bird from a falcon .
a falcon ?
they are fierce creatures .
why does the city have falcons ?
that shouldn' t be allowed .
write a letter .
on the other hand , we have a hero here .
way to go , stuart .
hey , dad .
what ?
silver lining .
it' s a guy thing .
is it ?
isn' t it nice that stuart has a friend ?
i don' t think stuart thinks of her as a friend .
what do you mean ?
i mean he' s smitten .
he' s infatuated .
he' s bedazzled .
but he' s a baby .
boys start having crushes really young .
frederick , did you have many crushes ?
i' m still having one .
so , margalo , can i get you anything else ?
whip you up an omelet ?
pop you a tart ?
stuart , i' m full .
full ?
you eat like a bird .
come on , stuart , time for school .
i' m not going to school .
i' m staying home to take care of margalo .
guess again .
you are going to school , and i' il take care of margalo .
look both ways crossing the street ... ... wear galoshes and , in art class , don' t run with scissors .
i' il get your backpack .
mothers ....
you know .
well , i don' t really know .
no ?
see , my mom just kind of one day ... ... wasn' t there anymore .
so you' ve been completely on your own all your life ?
you bet .
i' il bet it' s been scary .
no , it' s been an adventure .
i wish i had some adventures .
i' m only allowed to paint .
hey , life is an adventure .
just walking out that door is an adventure .
come on , stu .
we' re late .
go for it , kid .
the adventure begins .
that feels like enough adventure for one day .
hey , look !
the yankees won .
there we go .
can you say , " walk with mommy " ?
mommy " ?
walk " ?
nothing .
martha and i are going out for a bit .
can i bring you anything ?
no , thanks .
say , " bye bye , birdie .
say , " bye bye . " martha .
say , " bye bye , birdie .
fresh air .
remember me ?
you scared me .
what can i say ?
i' m a scary guy .
so , margalo , you case the joint ?
any valuables ?
come on , thrill me .
chill me .
they ain' t got much .
the mom' s got a ring , but it' s only two carats .
all right , fine .
what else have they got ?
well , you know , not that much .
i mean , they mostly just have each other .
a moment while i vomit .
why don' t we just try somewhere else ?
because you' re set up here .
they trust you .
they like you .
and maybe ... ... you like them .
hey , margalo , come on .
don' t con a conman .
nobody else ever invited me to live with them .
oh , really ?
who found a pitiful orphan bird ... ... and plucked her out of the gutter ?
who shared his food with her ... ... and , i hasten to add , taught her a trade ?
who ?
you did .
i did .
right .
well , then , straighten up and fly right .
and remember , you are here on business .
you' re not here to play around .
come on , falcon !
when i' m on a job , i never play around !
are you cold ?
i guess when the weather gets too cold , you' il just fly south for the winter ?
well , to tell you the truth , i' ve never flown south .
it' s kind of a dream of mine .
get out of this cold , windy city , catch that jet stream ....
fruit trees , millions of new birds to meet .
i hear it' s paradise .
then how come you haven' t gone ?
something' s always stopping me .
something' s always stopping me , too .
everybody around here thinks i' m too small to accomplish anything .
hey , the way i see it , you' re as big as you feel .
yeah .
boy , i' m really glad you fell into my car .
i mean , you know ....
i mean i' m not glad you fell .
i just ....
want some more popcorn ?
okay .
what ?
my pin .
it' s fixed .
how
on my way home from school , i drive right past where you crashed .
it was no big deal .
i mean , there was finding it ... ... figuring out how the pieces fit together ... ... and you know , fixing it .
and no big deal .
just ...
oh , scottie . ... one , two , three .
good as new .
no , stuart , it' s not .
it' s much , much better .
stay with me .
all the time .
did you really think i wouldn' t find out ?
what are you talking about ?
i' m talking about you and your little mouse friend .
big mistake !
never make a friend i can eat .
now , get me that ring !
or the mouse is lunch .
i' il do the dishes .
you did them last night .
for you , i' d do dishes every night .
that way , i don' t have to change the baby .
she just dropped her dolly .
i' il just
frederick !
what ?
my ring .
it' s gone .
what do you mean ?
it' s gone !
are you absolutely ....
positive .
unless ....
i' il call the plumber !
what' s going on ?
mom' s ring went down the drain .
i can' t reach it .
hey !
what about me ?
i can do it .
let me go , dad .
go where ?
down the drain .
i can bring it back up .
it' s an adventure .
i don' t know .
it' s awfully dark down there .
and smelly .
and cold .
but it' s mom' s ring .
she loves that ring .
come on , dad .
let me try .
now , if it gets too cold , or too scary ... ... you just tell us .
don' t worry , dad .
i can handle it .
or yank on the string , we' il pull you up .
will do .
how' s it so far ?
wet .
there' s a lot of slimy stuff all over the walls .
what does it look like ?
like the inside of your nose .
can you see the bottom yet ?
no , just more pipe .
and everything we ate for dinner last week .
and the pipe seems to go on and on .
well , the plumber said ....
what' s going on ?
is that a new top ?
you know , you have such taste .
simple elegance is what i call it .
what' s on the other end of that string ?
this string ?
yes .
well , now , don' t get excited , but someone that you and i love ... ... has volunteered to go down the drain to get your ring .
stuart ?
good guess , mom .
you let our son go down the kitchen drain ?
now , eleanor , don' t be upset .
it' s been well thought out .
if there' s a problem , i pull on the string and ....
now you can be upset .
are you okay ?
can you hear me ?
hurry !
i' m slipping .
get more string .
great .
there must be string here .
there is no more .
what else can we use ?
spaghetti ?
we' re out of spaghetti .
well , do we have macaroni ?
that' s too short .
we can tie it together with  no .
hurry !
hang on , stuart !
margalo , what are you doing ?
stuart , i' m coming !
grab on !
lower !
lower !
i got it !
are you all right ?
are you hurt ?
don' t scare me like that .
margalo , you' re the best friend i ever had .
what if someone had accidentally turned on the garbage disposal ?
i would not have let that happen .
you let him go down the drain .
he wanted to go .
if martha wanted to go up the chimney ... ... or george wanted to go into the toilet , would you let them ?
i love stuart as much as you do .
i just don' t happen to be quite as ....
emotional ?
irrational ?
what were you going to say ?
i forget .
i know i' m overprotective , it' s just ... ... i can' t stand the idea of stuart getting hurt .
i' m sorry , stuart .
what ?
you people sure like your meat loaf .
you find the ring ?
everything but .
has anyone seen margalo ?
i can' t find her anywhere .
maybe she just went for a walk or a little flight around the neighborhood .
sure , to strengthen her wing .
yeah , maybe .
but why' d she leave me her pin ?
oh , you know , stuart ... ... margalo is kind of a free spirit .
maybe she just felt it was time to go .
without even saying goodbye ?
what are you doing ?
i think i know what happened .
i think that falcon got her .
yeah ?
i' m going to find her .
and don' t try to talk me out of it .
i' ve made up my mind .
are you crazy ?
you can' t go out there .
because i' m too small ?
let me tell you something , you' re as big as you feel .
then let me come with you .
no , i need you to stay and cover for me .
cover for you ?
how ?
make something up .
you' re smart .
stuart , she' s just a bird .
no , george , she' s my friend .
and when you' re friends with stuart little , you' re friends for life .
well , ifyou won' t let me come , at least get somebody to go with you .
snow !
the good silverware' s in the dining room .
take anything , but don' t hurt me .
it' s me .
stuart .
you .
this better be important .
margalo' s still missing .
i should' ve been more specific .
i meant important to me .
i' m going to look for her .
i hoped you' d come .
look , stuart , do yourself a favor .
buy a parakeet and forget her .
i can' t forget her .
she' s in terrible trouble and i have to help her .
i mean what am i , a man or a ... ... mouse ?
is that a trick question ?
it' s important .
you got to help me .
and why would i do that ?
well , because we' re family ... ... and because i' d do the same for you .
and if you don' t , and the littles ask where i am , george' il say you ate me .
what ?
why you little rat !
you know something ?
everybody thinks you' re so nice .
you' re not so nice .
come on !
it' il be fun .
it' s an adventure .
hey !
mario andretti , slow down .
let' s pace ourselves .
i' il have a heart attack .
i think i' m having a thrombosis and i don' t even know what it means .
george !
stuart !
breakfast !
get it while it' s hot .
say , " mama .
say , " dada .
say anything ?
' morning , george .
where' s stuart ?
he already left .
he did ?
without eating breakfast ?
he had to get to school early ... ... because he' s in a school play .
really ?
yes .
he plays a mouse .
and they rehearse every morning before school .
why didn' t he tell us ?
he forgot .
you know , being worried about margalo .
right .
good .
this' il keep his mind off it .
got to go .
say , " oatmeal .
oh , boy .
this is a sign , stuart .
like the burning bush .
except it' s a carburetor and i' m not moses .
but it' s telling us something .
let your people go !
we' re not giving up .
oh , why not ?
giving up is fun .
and look at all the time you save .
i' m telling you , if more people gave up , there' d be fewer wars .
bill .
george .
hi , mom .
where' s stuart ?
he' s not home ?
oh , i just remembered .
he told me to tell you that he' s rehearsing again .
at will' s house .
and he' s sleeping over there tonight .
sleepover ?
on a school night ?
hey , that' s what he said .
got to go .
hello ?
hey , will .
it' s me , george .
if my mom calls , stuart' s at your house , okay ?
hold on a second .
hello ?
will , hi .
it' s mrs. little .
may i speak with stuart , please ?
stuart ?
you know , my son .
oh , stuart .
you mean now ?
well , now is when i' m calling .
oh , he just went in the bathroom .
i think he' il be a while .
he brought a magazine .
well , then , is your mother there ?
hold on a second .
i told her .
did she buy it ?
yeah , but now she wants to speak to my mom .
what will i tell her ?
make something up .
you' re smart .
if i was smart , i wouldn' t be in this situation .
she can' t come to the phone right now .
she' s in the bathroom , too .
but not the same bathroom !
just let her know i called .
thanks .
okay , mrs. little .
it' s all clear .
i owe you one .
now will you tell me what' s going on ?
it' s too complicated .
later .
little hi , little low .
little hey , little ho .
boys home ?
well , george is .
but stuart is rehearsing his play .
then he' s sleeping over at will' s house .
he' s going without george ?
i think it' il give him room to grow .
oh , stuart , we' ve been walking for hours .
i can' t take another step .
you know me , i hate to be negative .
but when i walk this much , i chafe .
also , i hate to bring this up ... ... but i need to go tinky .
how about the alley ?
i' m a house cat .
we' re fastidious creatures .
we don' t just yell , " bomb' s away ! " and go wherever we are !
oh , look , let' s face it .
we' il never find her .
if only we knew someone who really knew the city .
yeah , someone who knows the city' s disgusting underbelly .
who do i know that' s disgusting ?
don' t threaten me !
what i could tell the health inspector ... ... would close you down in a new york minute !
monty !
snowbell !
what are you doing here ?
we' ve been looking all over for you .
we need your help .
hey , snow , are you two still friends or can i eat him ?
no , monty , you can' t eat him .
please .
no !
now , pay attention .
what do you know about a bird called falcon ?
falcon ?
oh , that' s a bad guy .
you don' t want to fool with him .
where would we find him ?
you don' t want to find him .
you don' t want anything to do with him .
trust me .
he' d eat you so fast you' d be falcon poop before you could yell for help .
falcons are vicious .
they grab you by your neck and carry you so high , you can' t even see the ground .
then they drop you .
and when you land , they drink what' s left through a straw .
snowbell , are you all right ?
oh , yeah .
i no longer need a litter box .
mop up on aisle three .
stu , listen .
this whole thing has been a groove and a gas ... ... but it' s important to know when the fun' s over .
you don' t want to be that last pathetic person who leaves a party .
i told you .
i' m not giving up .
we' re going to find the falcon .
all right , then .
it' s your funeral .
okay , listen .
listen carefully .
the falcon lives across the park ... ... at the very tiptop of the pishkin building .
not many people go up there .
and even fewer return .
well , here we are , snowbell .
this is it .
salmon , catfish , tuna .
why do they taunt me ?
how can you think of food at a time like this ?
stay on track , will you ?
i' m nervous .
when i' m nervous , i eat .
because i know in my growling gut if anything happens to you , i' il be blamed .
i' m sure they already know we' re gone and plan to replace me with a hamster .
don' t worry .
george has us covered .
george ?
george doesn' t know poop from applesauce .
and i say that with a great deal of affection .
hello , little residence .
oh , george .
i' m glad you answered .
who is it ?
can you speak louder ?
george , it' s me , stuart .
where are you ?
how are you ?
did you find her ?
are you all right ?
how' s snowbell ?
when' il you be home ?
mom and dad are asking lots of questions .
so are you .
i only have a second .
i just want you to know that we' re on the trail ... ... and with any luck , we' il be home by dinner .
and , george ...
... thanks for covering for me .
sure .
but where are you ?
now , listen closely .
we' re at the pishkin building .
please deposit $0 . 35 for the next five minutes .
snowbell , i need more change .
what do i look like , a fanny pack ?
are you still there ?
is that stuart ?
let me think .
yeah .
i thought he was coming home .
he is .
later .
he and will just need to rehearse some more .
in fact , i just left him at will' s .
hello , mrs. little .
is george home ?
will , i found it !
found what ?
the calculator .
the calculator ?
will , where' s stuart ?
it' s okay .
she knows about the play .
it' s supposed to be a surprise .
i had to tell her so she' d know stuart' s at your house .
we' re going back there .
oh , yeah .
right .
it' s going to be great .
i just need to get the calculator ?
to figure out how long to rehearse .
it' s a very complicated play .
come on .
let' s go .
see you later , mrs. little .
george , don' t forget you two have a soccer game later .
we' il meet you there !
i can' t handle this .
i' m too stressed .
all this lying .
i' ve never lied before .
that' s why she believes you .
boy , are we in trouble .
" we " ?
yeah , " we . " he didn' t spend the night rehearsing at my house .
what are you planning to do , mighty mouse , scale the wall ?
i' il think of something .
so long , snowbell !
you' ve got guts , kid .
guts and spunk .
not to mention moxie .
you' ve got guts , spunk and moxie .
okay .
here we go .
all right , falcon .
hand her over and nobody gets hurt .

is anybody here ?
i' m here .
i came for my friend margalo .
lfyou' ve hurt her , i' il
you' il what ?
tell me right now .
is she all right ?
why not ask her yourself , whiskers ?
margalo , run !
fly away while i' ve got him covered .
what are you waiting for ?
this kid' s priceless .
tell me , cheese face , does this sound familiar ?
oh , my wing .
i don' t think i can fly .
what are you talking about ?
i can' t drill through the wood .
she scammed you .
she played you like a harp .
margalo , what does he mean ?
okay , now it' s getting sad .
maybe this will clear things up .
my mom' s ring .
i' m so sorry .
i never wanted to hurt you .
but , margalo , why ?
don' t be upset , mouse boy .
she has conned smarter than you .
or did you think you were special ?
a real friend ?
i didn' t lie about that , stuart .
you are my friend .
then come with me .
she' s not going anywhere .
oh , yes , she is .
was that your best shot ?
now , let me show you mine .
don' t hurt him , falcon !
i won' t hurt him .
the sidewalk will !
can' t we talk this over ?
no !
stuart !
let me go !
no , falcon !
a few days in here should provide you with an attitude adjustment .
what have i done ?
i' il bet something terrible has happened .
the littles will kill me .
i know , i' il bring home another mouse in a snazzy outfit ... ... teach him to drive a sports car and pass him off as stuart .
who am i kidding ?
i have to get up there .
but how ?
i hope i live to regret this .
stuart ?
yoo hoo ?
come out , come out wherever you are .
please don' t jump out from behind anything .
remember , i have a strong stomach but a very weak heart .
here , mousie mousie .
snowbell ?
is that you ?
is that really you ?
margalo ?
where are you ?
ln the can .
oh , okay .
i' il wait .
no , in the paint can .
why are you in there ?
is this some kind of trick ?
just get me out .
is stuart in there , too ?
no , snowbell , he' s dead .
what ?
stuart is dead ?
falcon killed him .
no .
he can' t be , he' s ....
i was supposed to protect him .
i wish it was me who had been killed .
really ?
no .
but i am very unhappy !
oh , dear .
i' m dumped on a boat .
i' m on a garbage barge .
i got to get off .
hello there !
i' m over here !
on the barge !
can you hear me ?
help !
i' m not supposed to be here !
i need to get off !
help me !
help !
rita , hi .
i was in the neighborhood .
i thought i' d get the boys .
george and will ?
george and stuart .
george is here , but i haven' t seen stuart .
but he slept here last night .
no .
george !
what are you going to do now ?
which way' s canada ?
this is terrible .
i just want to go home .
i know a little is supposed to always see a silver lining .
maybe this means i' m not really a little .
maybe i' m just stuart nobody .
stuart nothing .
there is no silver lining !
oh , no .
what have i done ?
my plane .
my plane !
the silver lining !
this is it !
all right , george , where is he ?
and this time , the truth .
i' m not sure .
it is never okay to lie to your parents .
is it okay to break a promise to your brother ?
it' s wrong to promise your brother you' il lie to your parents .
listen to the tone of my voice .
tell us where stuart is .
it was a promise .
brother to brother .
george , i understand .
i have a brother .
but if he was in danger , that would matter more to me than the promise .
how would we all feel if anything happened to stuart ?
he' s at the pishkin building .
dad .
what ?
am i in trouble ?
no , son .
you' re in big trouble .
mom , dad , i' m really sorry .
you should be .
for all we know , stuart could be out there now , lying face down with his
or , he could be fine .
we don' t have to assume the worst .
after all , it' s not the little way .
yes , you' re right .
he could be puttering home right now in his shiny little car .
smiling and happy .
his whiskers fluttering in the breeze .
mom .
yes , george .
i don' t think he' s puttering home .
who would do this ?
tiny little vandals .
that miserable falcon !
from this day forward , i vow revenge .
if that falcon were here right now , i' d rip his throat out .
i' d scratch his face off .
i' d
that' s him .
don' t hurt me .
kill the bird , not me .
i' m going to be falcon poop .
well , well , well .
the canary is out of her cage .
and how nice .
she' s brought a friend for dinner .
too bad i don' t like canned food .
snowbell , get out !
can' t .
stuck .
too fat !
don' t do it , falcon .
or else !
do what ?
what' s he doing ?
or else what ?
or else you' il lose this .
put that down , margalo .
i' m through doing what you tell me to do .
i' m leaving you , falcon , forever .
oh , and what do you think you' il be without me ?
free .
big mistake .
i' il be back for you , fur ball .
don' t hurry !
stuart !
you' re alive !
so far !
where' d you get the plane ?
a garbage dump .
sorry i asked .
i hope we' re not too late .
keep your eyes peeled .
he could be anywhere .
careful now .
one step at a time .
that' s it .
you' re going to make it .
yeah !
i' m alive .
i' m alive .
stuart !
is that you ?
take me with you !
what about me ?
how will i get down from here ?
i think this is it .
turn here .
okey dokey .
no problem .
hey , look !
it' s stuart .
stop the car !
stuart !
look at that bird .
he' s bigger than me .
we got to save him .
come on .
it' s the littles .
i' m saved !
wait !
it' s me !
follow that flying mouse .
no problem .
hey little , ho little ... ... hoo little , hey hottle , ho wottle , wo wittle .
there he is !
if we get out of this , i' m sticking to painting and dancing .
hey , lady !
get out of the way !
he' s closing in .
oh , my goodness .
keep it running .
okey dokey .
no problem .
he can' t hear you .
i think we lost him .
going up ?
frederick , i feel so helpless .
a mouse needs to know his limitations .
stuart !
pull up !
i can' t !
it' s stuck !
well , try harder !
margalo !
get out !
save yourself !
no , stuart !
if we go , we go together !
stuart !
pull up !
pull up , stuart !
stuart , pull up !
you should' ve stayed in your little hole , mouse boy .
stuart , we can' t outrun him .
then we' il just have to face him .
it' s too dangerous .
i won' t let you do it .
but i have to try .
i' il be back for you later .
what do you mean ?
stuart !
don' t do it !
party' s over , fur face .
what' s he doing ?
they' il crash !
stuart !
turn !
run away !
bye bye , birdbrain !
oh , dear .
got you .
can' t i get a decent meal in this city ?
thank you .
stuart !
are you okay ?
i am now .
margalo saved me .
we saved each other .
what did you think you were doing ?
you almost gave me a heart attack .
i' m sorry , mom .
you ran away from home .
i know .
and you had george lie to us .
yeah .
then why am i so proud of you ?
mrs. little , this belongs to you .
my ring .
yeah , i took it .
and now she' s giving it back .
i' m just happy to have all ofyou back .
snowbell !
you made it .
thank goodness you' re all right .
snowbell , where have you been ?
you wouldn' t believe what stuart and margalo have been through .
you should have seen it .
these two were so brave .
let' s go home .
and how about me ?
i played no part in this ?
well , i have had enough !
i' m staying right here , folks !
oh , yeah .
you' il never see me again !
snow , want some tuna when we get home ?
tuna ?
i love these people .
wait !
wait for me !
i guess they' re flying south for the winter ?
i guess .
you' ve always dreamed of going , haven' t you ?
but falcon never let you .
every year i' d just watch all the other birds go .
the ones who were free .
you' re free .
we' d be so far apart .
it wouldn' t change a thing .
well ....
you' re sure of the way ?
we can call aaa .
we can get you maps , discount coupons .
there' s a place in south carolina where they do the best pecan pie .
i' m a bird .
instinct should take over .
i guess you' ve waited for this a long time .
all my life .
only ....
only what , dear ?
well , now it' s not just talk .
now , it' s the real thing .
are you scared ?
the world' s pretty big , and i' m pretty small .
somebody once told me , " you' re as big as you feel .
just spread your wings ... ... and soar .
i' il miss you , stuart .
i' il miss you , too .
i' il miss all ofyou .
you , too , snowbell .
i' m not going to cry .
little hi , little low .
little hey , little ho .
stuart ?
yeah , dad ?
what' s the silver lining this time ?
she' il be back in the spring .
bye bye , birdie .
did you hear that ?
her first words !
she spoke !
of course she did .
i knew she could do it .
big deal .
when she can fall from a tree and land on her feet , then i' il be impressed .
