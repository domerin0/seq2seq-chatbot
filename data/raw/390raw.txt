it depends on the cops .
some heroes think the rules don' t apply .

it ain' t easy , but i' m clean .

it isn' t worth the cost of the dirt to bury him .
you know ronan , right ?
he' s a good cop .
yeah , he' s a good cop .
he' s a good cop .
he busts his ass 14 hours a day and ends up in debt for life .

i' il be nice .
i just hope one ofthese nips speaks english .

the superintendent says it' s possible .
manned space flight is possible .
am i missing something here ?
he' s tired from the flight .
could i get some coffee ?
tell us who this sato guy is and maybe we can help you .
translate every word .
i want every word translated .
yes , i understand .
because of your negligence a criminal has escaped .
you should apologise .
our negligence ?
they had your documents , your uniforms and were in a secure area .
we' il take some ofthe heat for this but we' re not taking the rap .
the bite , the fall .
the blame .
this is an insurance policy .
he speaks english .
the police will find your escaped prisoner .
you are foreigners .
nothing more than interested observers .
go home , detective .
this is an international incident .
until you sign off on this dickhead , his ass is mine .
we either work together on this together or i' m going to the press .
all right , you can stay .
thank you .
you have to leave your guns .
we' re police offiicers .
you are civilians here .
it is illegal for you to carry a gun .
we understand .
nick , your gun .
happy ?
all your guns .
you assign us a cop who can find his ass with two hands .
what ?
he wants a tough cop .
of course .
you will have one of our top offiicers .
it sounds good , or he' s working on the dinner menu .
sayanora , chief .
where' s our cop ?
it is my honour .
stay close , please .
can we take a look at him ?
just a moment .
this is one ofthe phoney cops from the airport .
are you sure ?
yes , i' m sure .
he' s got no defensive wounds .
a nice , clean right handed cut .
he' s a fresh puppy .
the perpetrator could be wet .
look at this .
nice , maybe he' s got two fives for a ten .
the superintendent thanks you .
we should go .
wait a minute .
tell us what' s going on .
is sato doing his own guy ?
don' t interfere .
i' m not interfering .
this is what i do .
you' re just observers .
i usually get kissed before i get fucked .
what did he say ?
he likes a little foreplay .
detective !
he' s not going to break anything .
a little peroxide will get rid of the bloodstain .
what are you ?
detective conklin , nypd .
how did you get that blood ?
the girls think you' re the guy who lost sato at the airport .
just offthe plane and you make the evening news .
americans who are less than perfect are amusing .
can i talk to you ?
how did you get the blood ?
the girl who found the body was upset , so i put my arms around her .
are you from boston ?
chicago .
where did you learn japanese ?
chicago .
did you know the victim ?
he was just in here drinking .
did you see the killer leave ?
yeah , sure .
and he wrote his name on the back of my dress and said to give it to you .
anything else ?
what are you busting my ass for ?
because you could get me killed .
there' s a war going on here .
what are you talking about ?
between sato and his old boss sugai .
who knows about this ?
counting you and me ?
1 1 million .
did that woman tell you anything ?
why would she ?
i' m just an observer .
tell ohashi i' il report to him when he' s ready to report to me .
i' m a detective just like you .
bullshit , you' re a suit .
tell ohashi one good hand job deserves another .
charlie , get your map out .

we' il walk .
i want a complete file on sato , and a report on what happened here .

very well .
thank you .
come on , charlie .
you will have a long walk .
if i get lost , we' il call a cop .
what ?
i know he didn' t fill us in on the gang war , but i like the guy .
you told me it was four more blocks .
you said we' d walk home .
i don' t know where the hotel is .
this isn' t the time to ask you what' s going down with oliver ...
some suits back home think i cut a deal with sato .
they' re full of shit .
i' il back you up .
what' s going on here ?
what ?
what ?
what is your problem ?
i don' t know .
we should cut our losses and let the locals handle this one .
i can' t go back without him .
sato kojo .
he started as an enforcer and rose quickly to minor boss .
he controls some of the docks and some construction in hawaii .
the victim last night was one of sato' s guys .
and six hours earlier , sato put a hit on this guy ...
okada genkuro , an artist .
he' s an engraver .
48 hours later he' s in scalari' s .
who' s this with sato ?
sugai kunio .
top oyabun .
like your mafia bosses ... construction , gambling , extortion .
what' s sugai doing with sato ?
i don' t know .
even i know that sato used to work for sugai .
now they' re knocking each other off left and right .
these goddamn suits !
what' s with the swats out here ?
exercise .
training perhaps .
come on , start cutting us in .
i can' t figure out what was in that box in scalari' s .
drugs ?
no drugs .
steel , liquor , horses .
he owns part ofthe club miyako .
what' s going on outside ?
they have a tip about sato' s last hideout .
it' s only a tip .
it' s only a tip ?
i promise i' il keep you informed .
could you find the file on sato' s guy ...
shinji sekimitsu ?
please , i need authorisation .
no , it' s a training exercise .
observers .

that' s him , right ?
easy , nicky .
hi , sweetheart .
you remember me , don' t you ?
where' s your boss ?
i only want to talk to him .
what are you doing ?
this isn' t new york .
we' ve got rules here .
i' ve seen sato' s work .
he ain' t following your programme .
you must have patience .
fuck patience .
he was here .
i know it .
we have to go .
we' re just observing .
can i take a quick look ?
charlie .
i got something .
mas is in deep shit now .
you don' t want to eat that shit .
give me a stick .
son of a bitch !
i always said you were the best .
i owe you lunch .
where' s mas ?

what the fuck' s his problem ?
i will have no more to do with you .
please , get out .
i know you took a little heat ...
ohashi is waiting for you .
we' il square it .
let us explain what happened .
you have dishonoured me and our department .
you are a thief .
i saw you take the money .
you saw me take the money ...
i wanted to get things done .
i have informed ohashi .
he informed your captain .
we know what kind of man you are .
you don' t know one thing about me .
you and your self righteous bullshit will cost me my job .
if you pull it , you' d better use it .
watch this , okay ?
i only want to do this once .
look , see how the impression hardly leaves the ashes ?
there wasn' t enough pressure .
this is good , but this ain' t money .
the box contained samples or plates , and this is a counterfeiting war .
and you should talk to your partner before you go to the suits .
we were going to cut you in .
don' t ever say you didn' t have a good time with charlie vincent .
you know the american girl , is she around tonight ?
come here , baby .
join us .
come on .
what is this ?
it' s still moving in my mouth .
i haven' t taken the silverware , so just take a hike .

superintendent ohashi would like to see you in the morning .
smoke a little peace pipe here .
we' re all partners now .
mas , please join us .
we' il have a good time .
come on .
thank you .
conklin , i did my duty .
these are the men i work for .
you talk to your partners before you go to the suits .
you should think less of yourself and more of your group .
try to work like a japanese .
i grew up with your soldiers .
you were wise then .
now , music and movies are all that america is good for .
we make the machines .
we build the future .
we won the peace .
not one of you guys has ever had an original idea .
are you guys going to argue all the time ?
what is this , a conspiracy to fuck up my evening ?
mas , what are you doing ?
it' s good time time .
kampaitime .
up and down .
can i talk to you ?
look , i need your help .
i' ve got my tits in the wringer .

do you think i pay attention ?
you' d recognise if one of your customers had a different tie on .
he had a different girl every time .
i didn' t know of anybody regular .
that' s sugai and the girl in sequins is the one with blood on her hands .
you did your homework .
how do i get to him ?
i' ve been living in this country for seven years ...
i still can' t read the headlines .
how do i get to him ?
let the police handle it .
no one' s going to help a gaijin .
a stranger .
a foreigner .
me and you ... more you .
got to go .
hold on .
wrigley field has lights now .
yeah , mom told me .
did she ?
did she say it' s not stupid to be scared ?
but sometimes you' ve got to choose a side .
i did .
i' m on my side .
the drinks cost $1 25 .
how much was the fish ? $200 .
holy shit !
how much would it have been if it was cooked ?
did you pay ?
no , matsumoto signed it over to the osaka police department .
that' s the best thing he' s done for us .
you like the guy ?
mas ?
he' s okay .
who the hell' s this ?
i can' t figure this place out .
you want to play ?
you and me , come on .
