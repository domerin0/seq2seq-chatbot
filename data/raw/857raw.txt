right .
that' s tuesday dealt with .
let' s look at wednesday now .
uh ...
half seven mass .
i can take that .
and , uh ... maybe ...
could you take the eight o' clock at all ??
right , i can take that as well .
now , um ... the half six evening mass on sunday .
evening mass ?
too early .
no problem , i can take that as well , i' il just make a note .
morning , ted .
morning , dougal .
uh , dougal ??
there' s , uh ...
there' s some shaving cream just there .
no , there' s not , ted .
you' re grand .
no , on you .
oh , where , exactly ?
just there , below your ear .
here ?
yes , and there' s a bit more ...
gone ?
no , there' s still just a ...
it' s all over the place .
oh , god .
how on earth did all that get there ?
i didn' t even shave this morning .
so , what are we doing today , ted ?
confessions and things like that ?
yes , dougal , things like that .
it' s great being a priest , isn' t it , ted ?
god , it' s lovely out .
oh , wait till i tell you , ted !
funland' s coming to craggy island on saturday .
oh , yes , the fairground thing .
i wouldn' t have much interest in that type of thing myself .
they' ve got a spider baby .
a what ?
a spider baby .
a freak show thing .
it' s got the body of a spider but it' s actually a baby .
oh .
how is it a baby ?
does it have a nappy on or something ?
no .
does it have the head of a baby ?
um ...
no .
well , if it looks like a spider and it doesn' t gurgle or anything , how do you know it' s a baby ?
they keep it in a pram .
dougal , are you absolutely sure about this ?
you' re not confusing it with a dream or anything ?
no , honestly , i saw it on the news .
honestly !
oh ...
oh , wait now .
actually , now that you say it , it was a dream , yeah .
have you been studying this like i told you ?
oh , i have , ted .
sorry .
but we should go anyway , ted , it' il be great !
last year i did horse riding and it was just fantastic .
i didn' t know you rode horses .
well , it wasn' t a real horse , ted , like ...
it was this old fellow with a saddle on him .
god , he must' ve been about 80 .
of course , he couldn' t go very fast .
i was kind of lashing him with the whip and all ...
couldn' t get much of a response .
and how long were you up on him ?
oh , i' d say it was about , uh ... about an hour ?
so you were up on an 80 year old man , riding him around and whipping him for 60 minutes ?
you realise that image will stay with me for the rest of my life ?
i know , ted .
it' s great , isn' t it ?
come on , we should go .
no , i don' t think i could take the excitement , to be honest .
suppose i' il just see if there' s anything on the tv .
' what type of a jumper is that ? '
' well , basically ... '
ahh !
maybe i' il just go and study the old diagram .
hello ?
father ted crilly speaking .
hello , father .
sorry to disturb you .
my name is terry macnamee .
i' m producing faith of our fathers for telly eireann .
we' re talking to priests who work in isolated communities .
would you be interested ?
well , that' s very , um ...
that' s very exciting .
faith of our fathers is my favourite programme .
well , you were the first person we thought of .
if you are interested , i could come over .
we' d give you a small fee .
who' s that , ted ?
uh , no one .
no one ?
' hello , father crilly ? '
no .
must be someone , ted .
just a moment .
sorry .
how exactly do you get to craggy island ?
it doesn' t seem to be on any maps .
no , it wouldn' t be on any maps , now .
we' re not exactly new york .
the best way is from galway , go slightly north till you see the english boats with the nuclear symbol .
they go very close to the island dumping the old glow in the dark .
are there any other priests living with you ?
we don' t list anyone else .
um ... well , uh ...
no , there' s no one else here .
i' il see you on saturday .
i' il call when i get there .
bye .
the ants are back , ted .
never turn on the tv when father jack' s asleep .
you know how he is !
but he' s always asleep .
anyone who' s served the church as long as he has deserves a rest .
it' s an honour for us to look after him in his old age .
look at him , dreaming of past glories , no doubt .
girls , pay attention .
we' ve got a special treat today .
father hackett has volunteered to take you all for volleyball practice .
right , father .
he' s just reminded me it' s very warm , so no need for your tracksuit tops .
hello !
father dougal mcguire here .
and welcome to this week' s top of the pops .
in at number 45 this week is father ted crilly with i' ve got the power .
and at number 15 for the 16th week in a row is father jack hackett , with i' m a sleepy priest .
how did that gobshite get on the television ? !
hello to you all .
ah , is the television broken again , father ?
yes , we ...
there' s nothing wrong with it that can' t be fixed with a bit of you know what in the head department .
now , then , who' s for tea ?
me , please , mrs doyle .
tea ?
feck !
i' m fine , mrs doyle .
you won' t have a cup ?
no thanks , mrs doyle .
i won' t have a cup .
you sure ?
it' s hot .
no , i' m not in the mood .
all right , so ...
aw , would you not have a drop ?
no , thanks .
just a little cup .
i' m fine !
i tell you what , father ...
seriously !
i' il pour a cup anyway .
and you can have it if you want .
now ...
and what do you say to a cup ?
feck off , cup !
he loves his cup of tea .
feck off !
there you go .
feck off !
father crilly , i nearly forgot .
earlier , a terry macnamee called .
oh , right .
who' s that ?
never heard of him .
something to do with the television ?
he' s coming to fix it .
he' il be here tomorrow at 12 .
grand .
yeah , it' s good you called someone , ted .
it' s still not working .
# you' re simply the best
# doo doo doo doo
# better than all the rest , doo doo doo doo #
ahem .
you frightened the life out of me .
you' re doing the old pop star thing .
i was , ted , yeah .
it was great being on tv today .
i' ve caught the telly bug .
well ...
get to bed now and get some sleep , you don' t want to get over tired .
did you ever want to get into television ?
ah , no , i ...
i wouldn' t be interested in that kind of thing , really .
right .
you wouldn' t be much good at it , actually .
what ?
why not ?
well , you' re a bit serious .
and your eyes are a bit crossed .
they' re a bit wonky .
the cameras notice .
i am not cross eyed , dougal .
ah , you' re a bit , now , ted .
half the time i don' t know if you' re talking to me or father jack .
dougal , why don' t you just ... get some sleep .
right .
just have to say the old prayers .
our father , who art in heaven ...
hallowed .
hallowed be thy ...
name .
ah , papa don' t preach ...
dougal , you know you can praise god with sleep .
can you , ted ?
yes , it' s a way of thanking him for a tiring day .
god .
there' s lots of ways to praise god , isn' t there , ted ?
like that time you told me to praise him by just leaving the room .
that was a good one , yes .
ted ...
mmm ?
ted ?
yes ?
knock knock .
who' s there ?
father dougal mcguire .
good night , dougal .
i can hear you a bit better now , shh , yeah .
you made it , then ?
i think so .
there' s no indication it is craggy island .
there' s no signs or anything .
is there a man looking at you with a t shirt saying " i shot jr " ?
actually , there is .
ah , you' re here , so , yeah .
what ?
the line is bad , you' re a bit muffled .
i' m on a portable phone , you caught me by surprise .
i' m on the toilet .
right .
so , er ...
so where can we meet ?
anywhere we can get a few good shots ?
any local landmarks ?
no .
what ?
there are no landmarks here now .
none at all ??
no , the island itself is a kind of landmark .
for ships and that .
head away from it and you' re going in the right direction .
so , uh ...
there' s the field .
oh , a field .
well , that sounds ...
it' s not a field , really , but it has less rocks than most places .
never mind .
i' il meet you at the field .
how do i get there ?
ask tom there .
he' il help you out .
right , father .
thanks .
bird !
ooooo .
holy mary mother of god !
god , ted , i' m so sorry .
it was just a joke .
tr ... try to avoid doing that again , dougal .
i thought it was really ... herself .
that' s the last thing i need .
you' re right there , ted .
anyway , it' s time for jack' s walk .
time for your walk , father jack !
off around the cliffs .
can i bring him to funland , ted ?
he' d love that .
no , he wouldn' t .
take him around the cliffs .
this time , near the edge , put on the brakes .
he was lucky the last time .
right , ted .
um , you' re not coming yourself ?
ah , no , i think i' il stay here and pray for a while .
oh , ho , what are you after , ted ?
i' m not after anything , dougal .
it' s not unknown for members of the clergy to pray from time to time .
here we are , father crilly .
get away !
there' s nothing father hackett likes more than some fresh air !
come on .
oh , yeah .
that' s it .
yeah , yeah , no ...
ahh !
come on , father .
oh , now , come on , father hackett .
that' s it , now , in you go .
isn' t that better ?
good man .
this' il keep you nice and warm .
are you all right ?
ooh .
bye , then !
every single day the same thing .
once he' s out , he has a great time .
he loves them old cliffs .
i' il be off .
what are you up to ?
i' il just have a bit of a pray .
all right .
enjoy the rest of the weekend .
' patrons are reminded that parking is unavailable .
' a reminder of the unavailability of parking facilities . '
i didn' t know this bloody thing was on here .
hello , father .
hello , tom .
telly eireann lads get here all right ?
they' ve gone to film a bit of the island first .
they' il be back soon .
i' il wait in the field .
father !
yes , tom ?
i' ve killed a man .
did you ?
we' il talk later , i' m doing an interview for television .
' a little boy has been lost .
thank you . '
keep your hands on the sides !
' the child has now been found , thank you . '
you fat , smelly cow !
take this .
you have a face like a pair of tits .
well , at least that' s one pair between us !
hello , mary .
ah , hello , father .
hello , john .
pack of toffos , father ?
no , thanks .
i have to meet someone .
i' m to be interviewed for television .
oh .
really ?
that' s fantastic .
you know , father , i think you' d be brilliant on television .
well , thank you .
you' il be more than a match for gay byrne or terry wogan or any of them .
it' il take weeks to get to their level .
but i have to go find this film unit .
they probably want to do a few close ups and master shots and that .
don' t want to be late and get a reputation as a marilyn monroe type .
see you soon .
good luck , father ted .
get them fecking crunchies out .
feck off .
ted !
ted !
over here , ted !
come here and look at me !
hey , ted !
what are you doing here ?
i thought you weren' t interested in this type of thing .
you' re supposed to be taking jack for his walk .
well , um ...
the cliffs were closed for the day .
how could cliffs be closed , dougal ??
ok , no .
it wasn' t that .
they were gone .
ah .
the cliffs were gone ?
how could they just disappear ?
erosion .
come off and to the cliffs with you !
there' s just another couple of turns to go .
woooo !
' patrons are reminded to keep their hands visible at all times
' when not availing on the funfair rides . '
go straight home , do you hear ?
no more nonsense !
everyone else is here .
dougal , you' re a priest , show some decorum .
wish i wasn' t a priest .
what ?
i wish i wasn' t a priest .
jack heard you say that !
he told me he doesn' t believe in god .
dougal !
ted !
can i have a go on the crane of death , ted ?
the what ?
the crane of death .
there was a young fellow killed on it last year .
look .
i' m sick and tired of your ...
ted , a fortune teller !
we' il have one go .
don' t waste your money .
there might be something in it .
it' s rubbish .
how could anybody believe it ?
it' s no more peculiar than that stuff in seminary , heaven and hell and everlasting life and that .
you' re not meant to take it seriously .
you are so too meant to take it seriously !
are you ?
yes !
heaven , hell and everlasting life ?
of course !
look , dougal , if i let you go in , will you go home after ?
i will , i promise , ted .
all right .
hello .
let' s go , ted .
what' s wrong ?
i' m scared .
i' il do it and you can watch .
hello there !
sit !
first , cross my palm with silver .
silver ?
i don' t carry bags of it around .
give me a pound .
now , i' il interpret one card at a time , please .
be careful .
um ... i wasn' t concentrating .
perhaps i could pick another ?
no , this is a common misunderstanding .
the grim reaper doesn' t mean death in a literal sense .
rather , it may mean the death of an old way of life and the beginning of a new one !
i know what that is .
it' s probably about a new bicycle lamp .
another card , please .
is that good ?
well , ah ...
it will all become clear at the next card .
this is really weird .
there' s only supposed to be one in each pack .
hello , tom .
is father crilly around yet ?
he is , yeah .
he' s in there .
that' s a nasty scar you' ve got , tom .
where did you get that ?
i was , uh ... in an argument .
oh , i hope you won .
i certainly did .
that' s nothing .
i' ve had worse than that .
can you believe me own dad did that to me ?
it looks like a face !
' siobhan to the refreshment tent . '
where' s father jack ?
it' s nearly five , time for his drink .
you go that way , i' il go this way .
ok .
' siobhan , please report to reheat the hamburgers . '
come , now , father , we' d better be off .
come on .
father !
father !
there you are , father .
we got here at last .
father , father .
dead to the world .
you don' t know what' s going on .
gin !
vodka !
it' s time for your drink , come on !
ahhh !
are you lads from ... from the television ?
well , yes .
oh , yes .
we' il just ask a few questions .
am i gonna be on the telly ?
well , yes .
we' il start with a history of the island , then move on to how life has changed for the islanders ...
father , how would you say religious beliefs on the island have been affected by tv and greater access to the media ?
god , no , they' re talking to dougal .
think , ted .
drink !
drink !
there i am !
it' s me , look !
i' m on the telly !
' so , god , does he really exist ?
i mean , who knows ?
' i don' t know .
personally , i don' t even believe in organised religion . '
i know , it' s great , isn' t it ?
' a spider baby .
' it' s got the body of a spider but the mind of a baby and ... '
' it wouldn' t really bite you , unless it got a bit older . '
i can' t believe it either , i' m on the television !
that gobshite again !
is he never off the air !
' a child has been , eh , lodged in the tunnel of goats .
' if we could have a nurse , please , to the tunnel of goats , thank you .
' a goat and a child have now become lodged together , eh ,
' and a nurse has become involved in the ... in the incident .
' another nurse is required to release the nurse we asked for previously .
' thank you . '
