good morning , tom .
twelve is our number .
it' s the number of games my husband tom coaches at lincoln college every season .
it' s the number of times we zero out our bank account each year to make ends meet .
and it' s the number ofkids we try to keep track of .
hey .
good run ?
oh , yeah .
you need a paramedic ?
no, just a pair of knees .
you finish ?
still proofing , but i' m sending it to diane today .
look at this .
new , clean cover ... no peanut butter stains ... yet .
hey , baby ?
baby ?
you know , on the run , you know what i was thinking ?
what ?
well , we' ve been married , what , five years ?
twenty three .
twenty three .
sorry .
and i think we could use a little change around here ...
like like this lumpy old mattress .
maybe we should just , you know , get rid of it .
don' t be ridiculous , honey .
you know you can just pound the lumps out of a mattress .
what what do you mean ?
you can just pound the lumps out of a mattress ?
yeah, just randomly start swatting away .
and it goes flat ?
yes , yes .
just start you just randomly start swatting
careful .
i got a dog on me !
twelve' s an insane number ofkids ... but having a small family was never an option for us .
see , tom loved growing up with seven brothers and sisters .
and after my sister died , i spent most of my time ... wishing i had seven brothers and sisters .
tom and i met at illinois polytechnic university .
he was a senior dreaming ofbecoming the head football coach there .
i was a freshman dreaming ofbecoming a sports reporter .
he wanted eight kids , i wanted eight kids .
bam .
an hour after i met him , i knew he was the one .
wejust had family at the wedding .
oh , and shake maguire , tom' s best man .
what a hot dog .
ayear later , we had our first nora .
i loved taking her to work with me .
after charlie and lorraine were born , we realized our dream ofliving in the city ...
and having eight kids and two careers wasn' t gonna work .
as much as we wanted our big careers , we wanted our big family more .
so tom settled for a division ill coaching job at lincoln ...
i quit writing for the tribune , and we moved to the country .
tom and i got busy when we moved to midland .
we had henry , sarah, jake and mark in consecutive years .
then we went for magic number eight , and instead ... we got the first set of fraternal twins jessica and kim .
nine kids .
come on , you guys .
come on .
wave !
hi !
with each child , tom and i got further from our big career dreams .
but we didn' t think about that .
yeah !
oh .
sorry , coach .
we had our hands full with nine .
we were happy , and we were done .
then we went to a party celebrating shake maguire' s appointment ... to athletic director at our alma mater .
and , well , too many beers and nine months later , we had mike .
after that , tom got a vasectomy .
but he didn' t hear the doctor say that it would be a few weeks ... before the procedure became effective .
in ' 98 , nigel and kyle got us to that crazy number 1 2 .
but by then , tom and i were experts at managing chaos .
let' s move , gang .
come on , come on , come on !
woo , woo , woo , woo , woo !
charlie missed his curfew again last night .
take care of that .
hey .
you can only put on so much lip gloss , princess !
you blew my concentration !
temper , sarah .
now i get to start all over again .
wrap it up , lorraine !
okay , daddy . !
have you seen my frog , dad ?
sorry , charlie .
uh , nigel .
kyle .
it' s mark .
i knew that .
hey , teenager .
you got caught on mom radar last night .
you' re not gonna get that scholarship if you' re out late with beth ... the night before a big game .
well , i' m not so sure i even want to go to college .
since when ?
since beth' s mom offered me a job at the auto shop .
hmm .
sounds exciting .
well , we' il talk about that after you get your full ride .
and , meanwhile , in by 1 0 : 00 on school nights .
clear ?
got it .
anything else you wanna talk about ?
did i mention i don' t like you very much ?
yeah , you mentioned that .
then i' m good .
okay , me too .
dude , two words : need new skates .
dude , three words : paper route . hi .

hank and i are moving into our new apartment .

# [ woman singing ]
here you go , gunner .
are you hungry ?
look , i am totally aware that this family doesn' t value ... self presentation in the same obsessive way that i do .
fine .
whatever .
but one of my life goals ... aside from being , like , a fashion guru ... is to indicate to the local community that ... the baker family actually owns a bar of soap .
so , as self appointed in house rep of style and hygiene ...
i think i should be allotted at least five extra minutes in front of the mirror .
three .
done .
now help your sister butter the toast .
sarah , your suspension from lacrosse for excessive force has been lifted .
so you' re going today .
henry , you have band practice , all right ?
i cleaned your clarinet .
please don' t play with food in your mouth again .
kim and jessica , your teacher called and has made a request ... that you do not correct her in front of the class .
mike, you have show and tell today .
and , please , honey ... remember that body parts do not count .
kyle and nigel , you have a dentist' s appointment at 3 : 00 .
you' re goin ' to work with dad .
yeah !
and we' re shooting our christmas card today .
what time' s nora coming over ?
uh , she may not make it .
she hardly ever comes home since she started dating that doorknob .
he' s not a doorknob .
the man irons his jeans , mom .
yeah , that' s weird .
never mind .
i' il shoot it without her .
i' il photoshop her in .
honey , could you take 1 0 pounds off me with that photoshop thing ?
can i be photoshopped in ?
wait .
if sarah' s bein ' photoshopped in ...
then i' m definitely gonna get photoshopped in .
why don' t we all be
nobody gets photoshopped in but nora .

mom said it first .
we' re having adult time here , boys .

so why don' t you run along ?
mom' s right .
he is a wiener .
sorry about that .
kate likes you .
it' s just that, you know ... she had to have the biggest stud on the team .
so she , uh , chose the third string receiver ... and got all this .

we can get a new car .
and get this .
university employees can send their kids to school for free .
wow .
oh .
i don' t know , honey .
a division i coaching job ... that' s a lot of pressure and a lot more hours .
yeah , but with all the kids in school next year , we could handle more job pressure .
yeah , but , honey , midland is our home .
i mean , the kids ' lives are here .
midland has been great for raising our kids ... but i never expected ' em to sacrifice the way that i did .
you loved your childhood .
yeah .
except for this part the raggedy , hand me down part .
the stallions head coach .
it' s your dream job , isn' t it , honey ?
i want this one , kate .
let' s talk to the kids .

hello ?
hi , mom .
hi , nora .
you' re on speaker .
hi , everybody .
hank says hi too .
so , you guys are thinking about moving up here ?

just big enough for two , dad .
how' s your book going , mom ?
actually , i just sent it to a friend who' s in publishing , so we' il see .
could we stay on subject , please ?
beans' s mother' s buried here .
i' m not splitting them up .
they' re family .
we can build a fancy new memorial to pork in our new yard .
yeah , like we could afford that .
actually , we can .
i' il be making enough money to do that , get you out of hand me downs ... getjake those new skates , and get that new car we' ve been saving for .
but i have friends here !
honey , you' il keep in touch .
and you can make new friends .
quiet !
now , look , i know you' re all scared .
moving is a big deal .
we' re very comfortable here .
i get that .
and that' s why i turned down a lot of other coaching offers through the years .
but this is a job i wanted since we left chicago .
and , in fact , it' s more than a job to me .
um , this is my team ... and it' s my colors and it' s , um ... the stallions .
and they' re finally calling my number .
and i want you to take this risk with me , because if you do ...
i promise you , we will be ... a happier and stronger family .
you promise ?
i promise .
i would feel happier and stronger if we vote on it .
yeah , definitely .
we should vote .
that' s the only way to make it fair .
it' s the only way to do it .
all right , we can vote .
but in the end , your mother and i are gonna do what we think is best for the family .
what' s the point of even voting ?
i' m out .
let' s get out of here .
it' s not even worth it .
come on , guys .
hello ?

tell us , did you have them conventionally ?
well , uh , after the sixth one , they just kind of walked out .

the audience wants it .
oh , all right .
okay .
some , uh , call me a mom . others call me a primary caregiver .

kids , on the carpet !

i' m sorry .
mom . !
oh , honey !
oh !
oh , we missed you , sweetheart .
do that again , i' m going to have to pound you .
but i thought i was fedex .
your eccentricities and vision problems ... are genetic traits that could be attributed to any number of the baker ancestors .
yeah .
without you , we wouldn' t be the 1 2 bakers anymore .
we' d be , like , 1 1 .
i figured everybody hated me like sarah and lorraine hate each other .
there are times when i want to kill sarah ... but i' d kill for her all the time .
come here , cutie .
tom ?
you wanna say something ?
a few words ?
sure .
beans was a good frog .
he was , uh , not like a lot of the bad frogs ... you hear about today , all hopped up .
he was lovable .
he was almost human .
he was like , uh , one of the family .
except that , of course , he was green and he ate flies .
but he was a hopper .
he hipped and he hopped .
he loved hip hop .
mark , why don' t you i think you should say something .
for a long time , you were the only person i could talk to .
that' s different now .
but you' re the one who got me through .
thanks .
i' m resigning after the season , shake .
giving up the dream , huh ?
just going with a different one .
no regrets ?
if i screw up raising my kids ... nothing i achieve will matter much .
thank you .
we' il make an announcement at the end of the week .
come on .
keep the assembly line up here .
we gotta get this done .
where' s dad ?
he went to the game .
why didn' t he ask us to go ?
because ... he didn' t want you to be there on the day that he quits his job .
he' s quitting his job ?
mm hmm .
what would we have to do so he wouldn' t quit ?
i' il give up clarinet lessons .
i' il go back to hand me downs .
okay , ease up .
everybody listen .
dad' s a big boy , and he makes his own decisions ... and he' s doing this because it' s what he wants .
in that case , i totally take back what i said about the hand me downs .
i thought so .
anybody else wanna take back their offer ?
yeah , there we go .
i guess you could say that when tom and i left midland ... we had a mess of theories about how to raise children .
we still have a mess of children , but no theories .
sure , 1 2 is still our number .
it' s the number of months my book was on the best seller list .
it' s the number ofjob offers tom turned down before we found one close to home .
hike !
and each day , it' s the number of times i' m thankful there' s such a thing as family .
