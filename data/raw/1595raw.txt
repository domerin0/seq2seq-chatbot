i' il have that back , please .
don' t give it to him !

i' m human , you know .
rock !
so it' s these people you' ve neglected your duties ... ... to go chasing after ...
tima !
it' s you !
rock !
what' s going on here ? !
you told me no one survived the fire in dr laughton' s lab !
and how did you know about tima ?
answer me !
i will .
you are the one who must sit on the throne of power .
no robot must ever rule ... ... the ziggurat , and metropolis !
fool !
' robot ' ?
do you think you fool me ?
you' re out of line , boy !
get up !
i never want to see you again !
ken ichi !
so it was you who hired laughton !
what if i did ?
i' ve come from japan to arrest laughton .
my name is shunsaku ban ...
get in .
and ken ichi ?
you' il see him later .
i' m here to see superintendent notarlin .
he' s been transferred .
his successor hasn' t been named .
there' s been a mistake .
the malduks have taken my nephew away ...
handle it through your embassy !
at this moment our state extends its reach to the stars !
i tremble at the honor of announcing ... ... the culmination of humanity' s long history of intellect and science .
sak .
make it hot .
hot whisky or gin i can do , for a japanese detective .
hot whisky , then .
who gives a damn about the ziggurat ? !
and those malduks can eat dogshit !
here .
hey !
that was rock !
i heard he quit the party .
what' s he doing here ?
thanks .
take care .
whoops !
um ... ... a man earlier tonight asked me to give you this .
i said ' no ' .
he wanted it kept secret from duke red , and of course ... ... i said i couldn' t possibly , but ... his name was ' ken ichi ' .
' i can' t move at the moment , so i can' t ...
' ... come to you .
' i' m leaving the country soon .
' i want to see you again . '
ken ichi !
what' s going on here ?
you will bring her back soon , won' t you ?
i' il be in real trouble if they ever find out .
don' t worry .
this won' t take long .
this wasn' t my idea .
i have to get back .
you tricked me .
how else could i talk to you ?
where' s ken ichi ?
if you know , take me to him .
well , well , well ...
to talk to you , you' d never guess you were a robot .
i guess father chose his mad scientist very well .
what are you talking about ?
you being a robot .
that' s not true .
i' m not a robot .
so what are you ?
human ?
so who' s your father ?
where is he ?
my father ... ... is ken ichi .
the super being ?
a mannequin like you ? !
if you can' t take me to ken ichi , i' m going .
tima' s gone ? !
watch where you' re going !
let' s see inside this super being father wants so much .
come on , laughton !
n n notebook ...
that notebook ?
don' t be alarmed .
i taught rock a lesson he won' t forget .
where' s ken ichi ?
i' m looking for him , too .
i need your help for that .
you do ?
i think they' ve got him somewhere in the ziggurat .
i need to look for him ... ... on the ziggurat' s data network .
can you do that ?
hold out your hand .
ken ichi !
well ?
ken ichi' s in ... ... that building !
you did it !
i knew he was there !
what happened to me ?
i see ... you don' t know who you are , do you .
what do you mean ?
i' il report the instant we find anything , sir .
duke red ?
yeah .
anything ?
we can track the signal ... ... by where it burned out the splitters .
got it !
where ?
zone 1 , south block 1 7 .
the hotel coconut .
tell me , please !
am i human , or am i ...
well , you' re different ... ... from normal robots .
i' m human .
just like ken ichi !
uh , yes ... of course you are !
anyway , now we' ve got to rescue ken ichi .
tima !
i' ve been looking for you !
tell me what' s going on , or i' il charge you with kidnapping !
i' m not your man .
it' s your son you want to talk to .
huh ?
rock ?
i don' t know what the plan is ... ... but i suspect dr laughton was involved in it somehow .
and i suspect you had him killed ... ... to keep her a secret .
take him away .
come on !
that is a special throne made especially for you .
one day from here you will rule the entire world !
me ?
why ?
that is your destiny .
i' il show you .
ken ichi !
ken ichi !
ken ichi !
wake up , ken ichi !
it' s me !
can you hear me ?
ken ichi ...
ken ichi ?
what have you done to him ? !
he' s in no danger .
we just had to quiet him down a little .
ken ichi ?
ken ichi ?
i' il file a protest with my embassy !
it' il be an international incident !
oh ?
i didn' t realize you were so politically important .
my apologies .
but soon every nation in the world will bow down before tima .
make ken ichi the way he was .
what' s one or two young kids , tima ?
you have the power to rule the world !
what power is that ?
am i human ?
or am i one of those poor robots ?
oh , don' t be silly !
you' re nothing like those piles of junk !
then am i human , like ken ichi ?
what are you saying ? !
you' re no mere human being ... ... ruled by emotion and feeling , torn between morality and love !
you are the super being !
so then i am a ...
i' ve brought you new clothes , miss tima .
yes , you are a robot ... ... but you stand at the pinnacle of all existence !
no .
i have the emotions and love that you hate .
that' s because your full capacities haven' t yet taken form .
as your abilities evolve ... ... they' re simply taking the form of emotion and love .
in time ...
you will become one with that throne , a computer weapon meant on conquest !
your memories and emotions will all be erased !
how did you know that ? !
i fancy myself a detective .
come , miss tima .
you should change .
father ... open your eyes !
rock !
what on earth ? !
what are you doing ? !
it is you who must sit on that throne .
you are the leader we must bow to !
no !
tima !
you' re awake ?
i am a humanoid ... a machine made to destroy the world ...
not ' destroy ' !
' make again ' !
stop !
ken ichi ...
hey !
who threw that switch ? !
it just started up !
cut the power !
it won' t respond !
it' s going into the red !
dr ponkotz !
what' s that alarm ? !
the omotanium generator' s going wild !
what' s going on ! ?
i' m not sure ...
stop , tima !
you' il destroy the ziggurat !
this comes of trifling with robots .
her memory' s merging with the data network !
she' il go mad !
thus god destroyed the tower of babel ...
tima !
no !
she' s no longer the tima you knew !
all right .
the omotanium generator will explode if we don' t shut it down !
the chance of human survival ... ... will fall to 30 per cent within one hour .
my entire world wide network of forces ... ... will be completely activated within 30 minutes .
their targets are the world' s major cities ... ... and 7, 586 other facilities .
1 7 hours , 27 minutes .
hear that , duke red ?
your super being says she doesn' t need us !
tima !
come back !
ken ichi !
