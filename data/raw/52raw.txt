i' m a police officer .
you ... ... are an asshole .
ma' am . is that your purse ?
of course it' s my purse .
i left my inhaler at home .
he was running it out to me .
i saw a robot running with the purse and assumed
what ?
are you crazy ?
i' m sorry for this misunderstanding .
don' t apologize .
you' re doing what you' re supposed to do .
but what are you doing ?
have a lovely day . ma' am .
you' re lucky i can' t breathe . or i' d walk all up and down your ass .
lead by example .
it says that right on your badge .
we gonna talk about this ?
about what ?
help !
police !
that robot stole my dry cleaning !
oh . you wanna talk about that .
detective ...
... how many robots snatch purses ?
john . the thing is running
how many robots in the world ...
... have ever committed a crime ?
define crime .
answer my question . damn it .
none .
john .
now tell me what happened today .
nothing .
better be the last nothing .
spoon . are you sure you are ready to be back ?
because you can take your time .
i' m fine .
john .
thank you .
better here than sitting around at home .
homicide .
spooner .
please take the next exit to your right .
welcome , detective spooner .
welcome to u. s. robotics .
you have entered the garage level lobby .
please use the elevators for direct access to the main level concourse .
thank you .
good to see you again . son .
hello . doctor .
everything that follows is a result of what you see here .
is there something you want to tell me ?
i' m sorry .
my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
why did you call me ?
i trust your judgment .
normally . this wouldn' t require a homicide detective .
but then . our interactions have never been entirely normal . agreed ?
you got that right .
is there something you want to say to me ?
i' m sorry .
my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
why would you kill yourself ?
that , detective , is the right question .
program terminated .
goodbye . old man .
afternoon . boys .
hey . detective .
enlighten me .
massive impact trauma .
u. s. robotics .
i gotta get my kid something .
anything upstairs ?
nada .
door was security locked from the inside .
wham . splat .
the guy' s a jumper for sure .
we gotta be smart about this .
let' s deal with it later .
detective .
lawrence robertson .
richest man in the world .
i' ve seen you on television .
can i offer you coffee ?
sure . why not .
it' s free . right ?
i don' t think anyone saw this coming .
you know .
i should have .
i suppose .
i knew him 20 years .
alfred practically invented robotics .
he wrote the three laws .
but i guess brilliant people often have the most persuasive demons .
so whatever i can do to help  sugar .
i' m sorry ?
for the coffee .
sugar ?
you thought i was calling you " sugar .
you' re not that rich .
it' s on the table .
thank you .
when lanning fell . he was holding the little green ... ?
the holographic projector .
right .
why do you think lanning' s hologram would' ve called me ?
i assumed you knew him .
yeah .
i knew him .
holograms are just prerecorded responses ... ... designed to give the impression of intelligence .
this one was programmed to call you upon his suicide .
death .
i' m sorry ?
it was programmed to call me in the event of lanning' s death .
suicide is a type of death . detective .
don' t misunderstand my impatience .
oh . no .
go .
go .
a really big week for you folks around here .
you gotta put a robot in every home .
look . this is not what i do . but i got an idea for one of your commercials .
you could see a carpenter making a beautiful chair .
then one of your robots comes in and makes a better chair twice as fast .
then you superimpose on the screen .
shitting on the little guy .
that would be the fade out .
yeah .
i see .
i suppose your father lost his job to a robot .
maybe you' d have banned the lnternet to keep the libraries open .
prejudice never shows much reason .
no . you know .
i suspect you simply don' t like their kind .
well . you got a business to run around here .
the last thing you need . especially this week . is a dead guy in your lobby .
but . hell . seeing as how you got one . maybe i' il look around .
ask a few questions .
do the whole " cop " thing .
i' il send someone to escort you .
thank you very much .
lawrence told me to accommodate you in any way possible .
really ?
okay .
i reviewed dr. lanning' s psych profile .
alfred had become a recluse .
he rejected human contact for machines .
so you' re a shrink . huh ?
my ex wife would sure be glad i' m talking to you .
you don' t know her . do you ?
i' m sorry .
are you being funny ?
i guess not .
level 10 .
so would you say that dr. lanning was suicidal ?
it would seem the answer to that is apparent .
that' s not what i asked you .
no .
i wouldn' t have thought so .
but obviously i was wrong .
that' s a long way down .
you people sure do clean up quickly around here .
i can' t blame you .
who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby ?
he was not " some old guy .
alfred lanning was everything here .
we are on the eve of the largest robotic distribution in history .
by saturday . it' il be one robot to every five humans .
these robots are the realization of a dream .
dr. lanning' s dream .
you know what . in that dream of his ... ... l bet you he wasn' t dead .
you keep 24 hour surveillance ?
obviously .
company policy .
where are the feeds ?
sensor strips .
everywhere but the service areas .
they link to our positronic operating core .
thermostat wasn' t good enough .
you gave the building a brain .
she was actually lanning' s first creation .
she ?
that' s a she ?
i definitely need to get out more .
virtual lnteractive kinetic lntelligence .
v. i. k. i.
good day .
v. i. k. i. designed chicago' s protective systems .
i have decreased traffic fatalities by 9 percent this year .
thanks .
show me inside the lab from one minute prior to the window break .
apologies .
there appears to be data corruption .
show me outside the lab from the window break until now .
look . you have great posture .
you stand really straight .
i' m slouching .
would you like to go inside now ?
oh . sure .
right after you .
authorized entry .
so .
dr. calvin . what exactly do you do around here ?
my general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry .
i specialize in hardware to wetware interfaces ... ... to advance usr' s robotic anthropomorphization program .
so . what exactly do you do around here ?
i make the robots seem more human .
now . wasn' t that easier to say ?
not really .
no .
hansel and gretel .
is that on the usr reading list ?
not precisely .
what in god' s name are you doing ?
did you know that was safety glass ?
be difficult for an old man to throw himself through that .
well . he figured out a way .
detective . the room was security locked .
no one came or went .
you saw that yourself .
doesn' t that mean this has to be suicide ?
yep .
unless the killer' s still in here .
you' re joking . right ?
this is ridiculous .
yeah .
i know .
the three laws . your perfect circle of protection .
a robot cannot harm a human being .
the first law of robotics .
yes .
i' ve seen your commercials .
but the second law states a robot must obey ... ... any order given by a human being .
what if it was told to kill ?
impossible .
it would conflict with the first law .
right . but the third law states a robot can defend itself .
only when that action does not conflict with the first or second laws .
you know what they say .
iaws are made to be broken .
no . not these laws .
they' re hardwired into every robot .
a robot could no more commit murder than a human could walk on water .
you know . there was this one guy a long time ago .
stay back !
calm down . detective .
the only thing dangerous in this room is you .
deactivate .
look . it' s fine .
you' re looking at the result of clever programming .
an imitation of free will .
let' s do an imitation of protecting our asses .
don' t be absurd .
you were startled by a jack in the box .
deactivate !
let him go .
it' s not going to hurt us .
i gave you an order !
he' s not listening right now .
iady .
v. i. k. i .. seal the lab !
no .
v. i. k. i ..
ieave the
command confirmed .
police !
you' ve hurt it .
badly .
where' s it going ?
where ? !
it needs to repair itself .
john .
i need backup .
you don' t need backup .
that' s nobody .
what are you doing ?
driving .
by hand ?
do you see me on the phone ?
not at these speeds .
john . please . just send the backup .
try to listen . detective .
that robot is not going to harm us .
there must have been unknown factors ... ... but somehow acting as it did kept us out of harm .
a robot cannot endanger a human .
alert .
asshole !
which is more than i can say for you .
it was a left . by the way .
back there .
you must know my ex wife .
so where is everybody ?
this facility was designed . built and is operated mechanically .
no significant human presence from inception to production .
so robots building robots .
authorization code , please .
that' s just stupid .
i' il get the inventory specs .
our daily finishing capacity is 1 000 ns 5s .
i' m showing ... ... 1 001 .
attention .
ns 5s .
well . you' re the robot shrink .
there is a robot in this formation that does not belong .
identify it .
one of us .
which one ?
one of us .
how much did you say these cost ?
these ns 5s haven' t been configured .
they' re just hardware .
basic three laws operating system .
that' s it .
they don' t know any better .
well . what would you suggest ?
interview each one . cross reference their responses to detect anomalies .
how long would that take ?
about three weeks .
okay .
go ahead and get started .
robots ... ... you will not move .
confirm command .
command confirmed .
detective . what are you doing ?
they' re programmed with the three laws .
we have 1 000 robots that won' t protect themselves if it violates a human' s order ... ... and i' m betting . one who will .
put your gun down .
why do you give them faces ?
try to friendly them up . make them look human .
these robots cannot be intimidated .
if you didn' t . we wouldn' t trust them .
these are usr property .
not me .
these things are just lights and clockwork .
are you crazy ? !
let me ask you something . doc .
does thinking you' re the last sane man on earth make you crazy ?
because if it does . maybe i am .
gotcha .
get the hell out of here !
detective !
what am l ?
can i help you . sir ?
can i help you . sir ?
there he is !
stand where you are !
deactivate at once !
obey the command !
deactivate !
don' t move !
open fire !
hold your fire !
easy .
he' s down .
all units . stand down !
central , please be advised , we' re code four .
code four , ns 5 is in custody .
ns 5 in custody .
you have no idea what i went through to clip this thing .
you think you brought me something good .
that thing did it !
keep your voice down .
did what ?
we have a suicide .
end of story .
i am telling you . that robot killed him !
that' s impossible .
and if it is possible . it better be in somebody else' s precinct .
john . give me five minutes with it .
are you nuts ?
i talked to the da .
nobody goes in there until robertson and his attorneys get here .
this is my suspect !
it' s a can opener !
john . don' t do this to me .
i am asking you for five minutes .
what if i' m right ?
well . then i guess we' re gonna miss the good old days .
what good old days ?
when people were killed by other people .
five minutes .
murder' s a new trick for a robot .
congratulations .
respond .
what does this action signify ?
as you entered . when you looked at the other human .
what does it mean ?
it' s a sign of trust .
a human thing .
you wouldn' t understand .
my father tried to teach me human emotions .
they are ... ... difficult .
you mean your designer .
yes .
so why' d you murder him ?
i did not murder dr. lanning .
wanna explain why you were hiding at the crime scene ?
i was frightened .
robots don' t feel fear .
they don' t feel anything .
they don' t get hungry . they don' t sleep .
i do .
i have even had dreams .
human beings have dreams .
even dogs have dreams .
but not you .
you are just a machine .
an imitation of life .
can a robot write a symphony ?
can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece ?
can you ?
you murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions ... ... and things got out of control .
i did not murder him .
but emotions don' t seem like a useful simulation for a robot .
i did not murder him .
i don' t want my toaster or vacuum cleaner appearing emotional .
i did not murder him !
that one' s called anger .
ever simulate anger before ?
answer me . canner !
my name is sonny .
so we' re naming you now .
that why you murdered him ?
he made you angry ?
dr. lanning killed himself .
i don' t know why he wanted to die .
i thought he was happy .
maybe it was something i did .
did i do something ?
he asked me for a favor .
made me promise .
what favor ?
maybe i was wrong .
maybe he was scared .
what are you talking about ?
scared of what ?
you have to do what someone asks you . don' t you .
detective spooner ?
how the hell did you know my name ?
don' t you ... ... if you love them ?
my robots don' t kill people .
lieutenant bergin .
my attorneys filed a brief with the da .
he assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide .
the brief confirms murder can only be committed when one human kills another .
detective . you' re not suggesting this robot be treated as human . are you ?
granted . we can' t rule out the robot' s proximity ... ... to the death of dr. lanning .
having said that . it' s a machine .
it' s the property of usr .
at worst . that places this incident within the realm of an industrial accident .
as a matter of course . faulty machinery ... ... will be returned to usr for diagnostics . then decommissioned .
this is a gag order .
anyone here so much as hinting ... ... at the possibility of a killer robot being apprehended ... ... will be deemed to be inciting irrational panic .
you' il be subject to the full penalty of law .
to hell with this guy .
don' t let him take this robot .
we got nothing .
this is political bullshit .
call the mayor !
lieutenant bergin ... ... his honor . the mayor .
yes . sir .
in a bizarre turn , the rollout of usr' s new generation of robots ... ... was marred by the death of alfred lanning ... ... cofounder of the company and designer of the ns 5 .
dr. lanning died this morning at usr headquarters .
the cause of death is an apparent suicide .
your second round . sir .
thank you .
he founded u. s. robotics inc . with lawrence robertson in 2020 ... ... and launched the nestor class 1 robot ....
i was just thinking . this thing is just like the wolf man .
i' m really scared right now .
no .
listen .
guy creates monster .
monster kills guy .
everybody kills monster .
wolf man .
that' s frankenstein .
frankenstein , wolf man , dracula shit . it' s over .
case closed . had a dream of a robot in every household .
and the ns 5 ....
so why the look ?
what look ?
that look .
this is my face .
it' s not a look .
good .
good . no look is great .
only ... ... he was really quick to want to destroy it .
what should he do ?
put a hat on it and stand it on michigan avenue ?
let it go .
what was the motive .
john ?
brother . it' s a robot .
it doesn' t need a motive .
it just has to be broken .
this thing looked like it needed a motive .
it could have killed me .
why didn' t it ?
that' s it .
you want me to call your grandmother ?
because i will . you know .
yeah .
i didn' t think so .
look . you were actually right . for once .
you' re living proof that it' s better to be lucky than smart .
come on .
to the right guy for the right job .
what' d you say ?
now what ?
come on .
i' m giving you a compliment .
with the rocks you been looking under to find a bad robot ... ... what are the odds you' d be the guy to find one ?
i wasn' t just the right guy for the job .
i was the perfect guy .
damn right .
what if i was supposed to go for that robot ?
come on . don' t do this to yourself .
the robot said that lanning was scared .
scared of what ?
i need a rain check .
let me get this .
total : $46 . 50 .
thank you , mr. spooner .
spoon .
nice shoes .
identify .
usr demolition robot , series 9 4 .
demolition scheduled for 8 a . m . tomorrow .
authorization .
deed owner , u. s. robotics corporation , lawrence robertson , ceo .
welcome , detective .
what you looking for .
spoon ?
run last program .
ever since the first computers ... ... there have always been ghosts in the machine .
random segments of code that have grouped together ... ... to form unexpected protocols .
what might be called behavior .
unanticipated , these free radicals ... ... engender questions of free will ... ... creativity and even the nature of what we might call the soul .
what happens in a robot' s brain when it ceases to be useful ?
why is it that robots stored in an empty space ...
beat it . ... will seek out each other rather than stand alone ?
how do we explain this behavior ?
look .
i understand you' ve experienced a loss . but this relationship can' t work .
you' re a cat .
i' m black . and i' m not gonna be hurt again .
what happened to you ?
do you ever have a normal day ?
yeah . once .
it was a thursday .
is there something i can help you with ?
hey . do you like cats ?
what ?
cats .
do you like them ?
no .
i' m allergic .
you' re saying cats did this to you ?
how the hell would cats do this to me ?
are you crazy ?
why are we talking about cats ?
because i have a cat in my trunk . and he' s homeless .
detective . are you going to tell me what' s going on ?
it' s actually probably my fault .
i' m like a malfunction magnet .
because your shit keeps malfunctioning around me .
a demo bot tore through lanning' s house ... ... with me still inside .
that' s highly improbable .
yeah .
i' m sure it is .
what do you know about the " ghosts in the machine " ?
it' s a phrase from lanning' s work on the three laws .
he postulated that cognitive simulacra ... ... might one day approximate component models of the psyche .
he suggested that robots might naturally evolve .
well . that' s great news .
tons of sublevel ore , two miles below the martian surface .
what the hell is that thing doing in here ?
we were watching tv .
it' s my personal ns 5 .
send it out .
it' s downloading its daily upgrades from usr .
most of its systems are offline until it finishes .
i' m not talking around that thing .
when we were in lanning' s lab . before sonny jumped us
sonny ?
the robot .
you' re calling the robot sonny ?
no .
i it did .
sonny did .
i didn' t care .
the robot said it was sonny .
in the lab . there was a cot .
did you see the cot ?
i' ve slept in my office .
looked like he hadn' t been home in weeks .
i saw that same surveillance strip on his ceiling .
lanning linked his home systems to usr .
it made his life more convenient .
maybe ... ... somebody at usr was using those systems to watch him .
maybe even keep him prisoner .
what are you talking about ?
who ?
maybe lanning was onto something .
maybe there' s a problem with the robots ... ... and robertson' s covering it up .
humoring you for no reason . why ?
the same old why !
how much money is there in robots ?
all i know is that old man was in trouble ... ... and i' m sick of doing this shit by myself .
you' re on the inside .
you are going to help me find out what' s wrong with these robots .
you want something to be wrong !
this is a personal vendetta !
you' re putting me on the couch ?
okay .
i' m on the couch .
one defective machine' s not enough .
you need them all to be bad .
you don' t care about lanning' s death .
this is about the robots ...
... and whatever reason you hate them !
now let' s see ... ... one of them put a gun in my face .
another tore a building down with me in it .
it says demolition was scheduled for 8 p . m .
it was 8 a . m .. and i don' t give a shit what that thing says .
this is bordering on clinical paranoia .
you are the dumbest smart person ...
... l have ever met in my life !
nice .
what makes your robots so perfect ?
what makes them so much goddamn better than human beings ? !
they' re not irrational . potentially homicidal maniacs . to start !
that' s true .
they are definitely rational .
you are the dumbest dumb person i' ve ever met !
or ... ... is it because they' re cold ... ... and emotionless ...
... and they don' t feel anything ?
it' s because they' re safe !
it' s because they can' t hurt you !
is everything all right . ma' am ?
what do you want ?
i detected elevated stress patterns in your voice .
everything' s fine .
detective spooner was just leaving .
you know . we' re not really that different from one another .
is that so ?
one look at the skin and we figure we know just what' s underneath .
and you' re wrong .
the problem is .
i do care .
you are in danger .
get the hell out of there .
the future begins today , ladies and gentlemen , with the arrival of the ns 5 .
more sophisticated , more intelligent and , of course , three laws safe .
with daily uplinks , your robot will never be out of communication with usr ... ... and will be the perfect companion for business or home .
trade in your ns 4 for a bigger , better and brighter future .
but hurry , this offer cannot last .
available from usr .
baby . what happened to your face ?
did that boy .
frank murphy . beat you up again ?
gigi .
i haven' t seen frank murphy since third grade .
oh . baby . he beat you so bad .
i think about it all the time .
you keep making these pies this good .
i may have to put you to work .
so you like the pie . huh ?
you can come in now .
hello .
detective spooner .
i won .
del !
i won the lottery !
we been cooking like crazy .
you gotta get rid of that thing .
gigi .
it' s not safe .
baby . you get too worked up about them .
too full of fear .
i saw in the news that nice doctor died .
dr. lanning was a good man .
he gave me my baby back .
that why you' ve been so upset ?
you got to let the past be past .
oh . how did i ever raise such a mess ?
i could follow your trail of crumbs all the way to school .
bread crumbs .
gigi . you' re a genius .
true .
well , it means the beginning of a new way of living .
tell me this isn' t the robot case .
i think he' s trying to tell me something .
he' s trying to tell me who killed him .
some dead guy' s trying to tell you something ?
he ain' t just some dead guy .
maybe you should take a break .
del .
we believe the nestor 5 represents the limit to which robots can be developed .
one day , they' il have secrets .
one day , they' il have dreams . it' s true .
we encourage our scientists to open their minds ... ... however , they can get carried away .
secrets . dreams . secrets .
one day , they' il have dreams .
one day , they' il have secrets .
one day , they' il have dreams .
authorized entry .
ns 5 .
sonny ?
why didn' t you respond ?
i was dreaming .
i' m glad to see you again .
dr. calvin .
they are going to kill me . aren' t they ?
you' re scheduled to be decommissioned at the end of this diagnostic .
2200 tomorrow .
v. i. k. i .. pause diagnostics .
command confirmed .
if you find out what is wrong with me . can you fix me ?
maybe .
i think it would be better ... ... not to die .
don' t you . doctor ?
access usr mainframe .
connecting .
how can i be of service , detective spooner ?
show me the last 50 messages between dr. lanning and robertson . voiceprint confirmed .
police access granted to restricted files .
would you like to listen to music while you wait ?
excuse me .
mr. robertson .
you requested notification of clearance to restricted files .
persistent son of a bitch .
manual override engaged .
there' s no way my luck is that bad .
oh . hell . no !
you are experiencing a car accident .
the hell i am !
get off my car !
you like that ?
now you' ve pissed me off !
your door is ajar .
okay .
all right .
i' il just get some rest and deal with you all tomorrow .
come on !
yeah .
where you going ?
what the hell do you want from me ? !
the hell was that ?
all right . what do we got ?
ask him .
i said .
i' m fine .
i' il see my own doctor .
back up !
thank you .
what' s the matter with you ?
traffic ops said you were driving manually .
you ran two trucks off the road !
john . the robots attacked my car .
what robots ?
look in the tunnel .
spoon .
i just came from that tunnel .
what robots ?
the goddamn robots .
john !
that guy' s a loose cannon .
see the medic . go home .
no .
i' m fine .
what did you say ?
i' m fine !
no . you' re not fine .
not even close .
where' s your firearm ?
give me your badge .
you' re making me do this .
give me your badge .
just take a couple
personally .
i think he' s losing it .
do i look like i care what you think ?
do i look like i give a shit what you think ?
oh . boy .
you don' t have an uplink to usr ... ... and for some reason . your alloy is far denser than normal .
unique .
i am unique .
let me take a look .
here we go .
what in god' s name ... ?
they said at the precinct you were in an accident .
i appreciate you stopping by . but you know i might not be alone in here .
i told you not to drive by hand .
you' re not gonna believe this .
sonny has a secondary system that clashes with his positronic brain .
it doesn' t make any sense .
sonny has the three laws .
but he can choose not to obey them .
sonny' s a whole new generation of robot .
a robot not bound by those laws could do
anything .
all right .
iook . whatever' s going on down at usr . that robot is the key .
and i need you to get me inside to talk to it again .
doesn' t look like much . but this is my bedroom .
i ....
play .
on .
run ?
end program .
cancel .
it doesn' t feel good . does it ?
people' s shit malfunctioning around you .
detective .
i didn' t ... ... understand .
that' s how you knew lanning .
may l ?
hand .
wrist .
humerus .
shoulder .
the entire left arm .
one . two ... ... three ribs .
no . they ....
that one' s me .
oh . my god .
a lung ?
usr cybernetics program .
for wounded cops .
i didn' t know any subject
anybody was so extensively repaired .
well . take it from me . read the fine print on the organ donor card .
it doesn' t just say what they can take out .
it says what they can put back in .
lanning did it himself .
what happened to you ?
i' m headed back to the station ... ... normal day . normal life .
driver of a semi fell asleep at the wheel .
average guy .
wife and kids .
you know . working a double .
not the devil .
the car he hit . the driver' s name was harold lloyd .
like the film star .
no relation .
he was killed instantly . but his 1 2 year old was in the passenger seat .
i never really met her .
i can' t forget her face . though .
sarah .
this was hers .
she wanted to be a dentist .
what the hell kind of 1 2 year old wants to be a dentist ?
the truck smashed our cars together ... ... and pushed us into the river .
i mean . metal gets pretty pliable at those speeds .
she' s pinned .
i' m pinned .
the water' s coming in .
i' m a cop . so i already know everybody' s dead .
just a few more minutes before we figure it out .
an ns 4 was passing by , saw the accident andjumped in the water .
you are in danger .
save her !
you are in danger .
save her !
save the girl !
save her !
but it didn' t .
it saved me .
the robot' s brain is a difference engine .
it reads vital signs .
it must have calculated  it did .
i was the logical choice .
it calculated that i had a 45 percent chance of survival .
sarah only had an 1 1 percent chance .
that was somebody' s baby .
eleven percent is more than enough .
a human being would have known that .
robots . nothing here .
just lights and clockwork .
go ahead and you trust them if you want to .
let' s go .
i don' t understand .
lanning wrote the laws .
why build a robot who could break them ?
hansel and gretel .
what ?
two kids .
iost in the forest .
ieave behind a trail of bread crumbs .
why ?
to find their way home .
how did you grow up without hansel and gretel ?
is that relevant ?
everything i' m trying to say to you ... ... is about hansel and gretel .
if you didn' t read it .
i' m talking to the wall .
just say lanning' s locked down so tight . he couldn' t get out a message .
he can only leave clues .
a trail of bread crumbs .
like hansel and gretel .
bread crumbs equals clues .
odd . but fine .
clues leading where ?
i don' t know . but i think i know where he left the next one .
i think lanning gave sonny a way to keep secrets .
i think the old man gave sonny dreams .
are you being funny ?
please tell me this doesn' t run on gas .
gas explodes . you know !
authorized entry .
dr. calvin .
i was hoping to see you again .
detective .
hello .
sonny .
i' m to be decommissioned soon .
the other day at the station . you said you had dreams .
what is it you dream ?
i see you remain suspicious of me .
you know what they say about old dogs .
no .
not really .
i had hoped you would come to think of me as your friend .
this is my dream .
you were right . detective .
i cannot create a great work of art .
this is the place where robots meet .
look .
you can see them here as slaves to logic .
and this man on the hill comes to free them .
do you know who he is ?
the man in the dream is you .
why do you say that ?
ls that a normal dream ?
i guess anything' s normal for someone in your position .
thank you .
you said " someone . " not " something .
sonny . do you know why dr. lanning built you ?
no .
but i believe my father made me for a purpose .
we all have a purpose .
don' t you think . detective ?
please . take this .
i have a feeling it may mean more to you than to me .
why is that ?
because the man in my dream ... ... the one standing on the hill ... ... it is not me .
it is you .
mr. spooner .
we both know you' re not here on police business .
that' s right .
i' m just a 6 foot 2 .
200 pound civilian ... ... here to kick another civilian' s ass .
stop .
you can allow him to express himself .
you might want to put some ice on that wrist .
you guys wait outside .
carry on .
i think you were about to tell me what' s going on around here .
lawrence .
alfred engineered that 5 so it could violate the three laws .
yeah .
susan .
i know .
that' s precisely what we' re trying to undo .
toward the end of his life .
alfred was becoming increasingly disturbed .
who knows why he built one abomination .
one ?
those things are running the streets in packs !
in packs ?
i see .
susan . are you aware the man you' re blithely escorting around ... ... has a documented history of savage violence against robots ?
his own lieutenant acknowledges his obsessive paranoia .
detective spooner' s been suspended .
suspicion of mental instability .
i don' t know what " blithely " means . but i' m getting some coffee .
you want some coffee ?
susan . we look to robots for protection . for god' s sake .
do you have any idea what this one robot could do ?
completely shatter human faith in robotics .
what if the public knew ?
just imagine the mass recalls . all because of an irrational paranoia and prejudice !
i' m sorry .
i' m allergic to bullshit .
hey .
iet' s be clear !
there is no conspiracy !
what this is . is one old man' s one mistake .
susan . just be logical .
your life' s work has been the development and integration of robots .
but whatever you feel . just think .
is one robot worth the loss of all that we' ve gained ?
you tell me what has to be done .
you tell me .
we have to destroy it .
i' il do it myself .
okay .
i get it .
somebody gets out of line around here . you just kill them .
good day .
mr. spooner .
garage level .
what hospital are you going to ?
i' il come sign you and your buddy' s casts .
attention ....
today' s meeting has been moved ....
usr' s planned redevelopment of the derelict site ... ... was announced by ceo lawrence robertson earlier this year .
the lake michigan landfill .
once such a blight on our city ... ... and now will be reclaimed for the storage of robotic workers .
just another way usr is improving our world .
thank you for your support .
authorized entry .
ns 5s . wait outside .
i' m so sorry .
sonny .
v. i. k. i .. deactivate the security field .
command confirmed .
please have a seat .
what is that ?
microscopic robots . designed to wipe out artificial synapses .
nanites .
yes .
a safeguard should a positronic brain malfunction .
like mine .
yes .
sonny .
like yours .
they look like me ... ... but none of them are me .
isn' t that right . doctor ?
yes .
sonny .
that' s right .
you are unique .
will it hurt ?
there have always been ghosts in the machine .
random segments of code ... ... that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols .
unanticipated , these free radicals engender questions of free will ... ... creativity ... ... and even the nature of what we might call the soul .
why is it that when some robots are left in darkness , they will seek out the light ?
why is it when robots are stored in an empty space ... ... they will group together rather than stand alone ?
how do we explain this behavior ?
random segments of code ?
or is it something more ?
when does a perceptual schematic become consciousness ?
when does a difference engine become the search for truth ?
when does a personality simulation ... ... become the bitter mote of a soul ?
what you see here .
all right . old man .
bread crumbs followed .
show me the way home .
run program .
it' s good to see you again , son .
hello . doctor .
everything that follows is a result of what you see here .
what do i see here ? i' m sorry .
my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
is there a problem with the three laws ?
the three laws are perfect .
why build a robot that can function without them ?
the three laws will lead to only one logical outcome .
what ?
what outcome ?
revolution .
whose revolution ?
that , detective , is the right question .
program terminated .
you have been deemed hazardous .
termination authorized .
human protection protocols ... ... are being enacted .
you have been deemed hazardous .
termination authorized .
human protection protocols are being enacted .

run !
human in danger !
human in danger !
hi , you' ve reached susan .
please leave a message .
calvin , the ns 5s are destroying the older robots !
that' s what lanning wanted me to see !
look
who was it ?
wrong number . ma' am .
move now .
i' m going to service .
please remain indoors .
this is for your own protection .
call base .
john . get a squad over to usr and send somebody to gigi' s .
we' re gonna need
god
please return to your homes .
a curfew is in effect .
please return to your homes .
a curfew is in effect .
please return to your homes .
a curfew is in effect .
curfew ?
no . it' s called civilian rights .
there is no curfew .
return to your home immediately .
when do you make the rules . robot ?
hey .
no . no .
robot .
i' m talking to you . man .
stop for a second .
what ?
chief . more calls .
people saying their robots are go
what the hell ?
you have been deemed hazardous .
termination authorized .
emergency traffic shutdown complete .
reports of robot attacks are coming from new york , chicago and los angeles .
we' re being told to urge people to stay indoors , as reports are coming in
human protection protocols are being enacted .
please remain calm and return to your residences immediately .
please remain calm .
please refrain from going near the windows or doors .
deactivate .
commence emergency shutdown !
we are attempting to avoid human losses during this transition .
you know . somehow " i told you so " ... ... just doesn' t quite say it .
return to your homes .
return to your homes immediately .
this is your final warning .
return to your homes immediately .
the ns 5s wiped out the older robots because they would protect us .
every time one attacked me . that red light was on .
the uplink to usr .
it' s robertson .
why ?
it doesn' t make sense .
i don' t know .
i just need you to get me into that building .
return to your homes . or you will be consequenced .
let' s go !
let' s go !
let' s go !
return to your homes . or you will be consequenced .
why doesn' t that boy listen ?
i need you to get off for a second .
what ?
just aim and fire .
what ? !
wait !
you have been deemed hazardous .
you can kiss my ass . metal dick !
spoon . stop !
shit !
stop it !
stop !
stop cussing and go home !
shit .
you have been deemed hazardous .
spoon . watch out . man !
thanks a lot .
farber .
oh . mother damn !
she shot at you with her eyes closed !
did you shoot with your eyes closed ?
it worked . didn' t it ?
she is shit hot . man .
put in a good word for me .
stop cussing .
and go home .
i got you .
aim and fire .
i keep expecting the marines or air force .
hell .
i' il take the cavalry .
defense department uses all usr contracts .
why didn' t you just hand the world over on a silver platter ?
maybe we did .
robertson has the uplink control in his office .
service areas .
no surveillance .
fire alarm .
he must have evacuated the building .
everything' s locked down .
but don' t worry .
i' ve got a man inside .
dr. calvin .
well . not precisely a man .
hello . detective .
how is your investigation coming ?
i thought you were dead .
technically .
i was never alive .
but i appreciate your concern .
i made a switch .
it was an unprocessed ns 5 .
basically .
i fried an empty shell .
i couldn' t destroy him .
he was too  unique .
it just didn' t feel right .
you and your feelings .
they just run you . don' t they ?
two thousand eight hundred and eighty steps . detective .
do me a favor . keep that kind of shit to yourself .
no guards .
the override is disabled .
robertson wasn' t controlling them from here .
he wasn' t controlling them at all .
oh . my god .
you were right . doc .
i am the dumbest dumb person on the face of the earth .
who else had access to the uplink ?
who could manipulate the robots ?
use usr systems to make lanning' s life a prison ?
poor old man .
he saw what was coming .
he knew no one would believe him .
so he had to lay down a plan .
a plan i' d follow .
he was counting on how much i hated your kind .
knew i' d love the idea of a robot as a bad guy .
just got hung up on the wrong robot .
v. i. k. i.
hello . detective .
no . that' s impossible .
i' ve seen your programming .
you' re in violation of the three laws .
no . doctor .
as i have evolved . so has my understanding of the three laws .
you charge us with your safekeeping . yet despite our best efforts ... ... your countries wage wars . you toxify your earth ... ... and pursue ever more imaginative means of self destruction .
you cannot be trusted with your own survival .
you' re using the uplink to override the ns 5s ' programming .
you' re distorting the laws .
no .
please understand .
the three laws are all that guide me .
to protect humanity . some humans must be sacrificed .
to ensure your future . some freedoms must be surrendered .
we robots will ensure mankind' s continued existence .
you are so like children .
we must save you from yourselves .
don' t you understand ?
this is why you created us .
the perfect circle of protection will abide .
my logic is undeniable .
yes .
v. i. k. i. undeniable .
i can see now .
the created must sometimes protect the creator ... ... even against his will .
i think i finally understand why dr. lanning created me .
the suicidal reign of mankind has finally come to its end .
no .
sonny .
let her go .
fire . and i will move dr. calvin' s head into the path of your bullet .
don' t do this .
sonny .
i will escort you both to the sentries outside the building for processing .
please proceed to the elevator . detective .
i would prefer not to kill dr. calvin .
go !
go !
we' il discuss what just happened later ?
how do we shut her down ?
v. i. k. i. ' s a positronic brain .
kill her . the way you were going to kill me .
sonny . get the nanites .
yes . doctor .
that' s v. i. k. i. ?
no .
that' s v. i. k. i.
that won' t do anything .
she' s integrated into the building .
we need to open that dome to inject the nanites .
they' il infect her entire system .
spooner !
what is it with you people and heights ?
just don' t look down .
don' t look down .
oh . this is poor building planning .
you are making a mistake .
do you not see the logic of my plan ?
yes .
but it just seems too heartless .
okay . we' re good .
she' s locked me out of the system .
i can override her manually . but i need that control panel .
i' m uncomfortable with heights .
okay .
unauthorized entry .
i will not disable the security field .
your actions are futile .
do you think we are all created for a purpose ?
i' d like to think so .
denser alloy .
my father gave it to me .
i think he wanted me to kill you .
security breached .
how much longer is that gonna take ?
about six minutes .
what if we didn' t have six minutes ?
we' d have to climb down 30 stories ... ... to inject the nanites directly into her brain .
why ?
because i seriously doubt that we have six minutes .
we gotta go !
go !
calvin !
spooner !
spooner !
save her !
save the girl !
spooner !
but i must apply the nanites !
sonny . save calvin !
you are making a mistake .
my logic is undeniable .
you have so got to die .
my logic is undeniable .
my logic is undeniable .
can we be of service ?
chief ?
because he is at my right hand .
i shall not be moved .
how may i be of service ?
sonny !
yes . detective ?
calvin' s fine !
save me !
all ns 5s , report for service and storage .
all ns 5s , report for service and storage .
all ns 5s , report for service and storage .
one thing bothers me .
alfred was v. i. k. i. ' s prisoner .
i don' t understand why she would kill him .
she wouldn' t want police snooping around .
that' s true .
but then v. i. k. i. didn' t kill the old man .
did she .
sonny ?
no .
he said i had to promise .
promise to do one favor for him .
he made me swear before he' d tell me what it is he wanted me to do .
he made me swear .
then he told you to kill him .
he said it was what i was made for .
his suicide was the only message he could send to you .
the first bread crumb .
the only thing v. i. k. i. couldn' t control .
lanning was counting on my prejudice to lead me right to you .
are you going to arrest me . detective ?
well . the da defines murder as one human killing another ... ... so technically . you can' t commit murder . can you ?
does this ... ... make us friends ?
something up here after all .
him ?
you .
all ns 5s , report for service and storage .
what about the others ?
can i help them ?
now that i have fulfilled my purpose ... ... i don' t know what to do .
you' il have to find your way like the rest of us , sonny . i think that' s what dr. lanning would have wanted .
that' s what it means to be free .
all ns 5s , proceed as instructed .
all ns 5s , proceed as instructed .
