see you tomorrow .
oh , my god !
i' m in .
we' re almost there .
sir , are you sure about this ?
i told you , we' re going to be all right .
i understand , sir .
it' s just that i' m scoping some serious sentinel activity up here .
link .
yes , sir ?
given your situation , i can' t say i understand your reasons ... ... for volunteering to operate onboard my ship .
however , if you wish to continue to do so , i must ask you to do one thing .
what' s that , sir ?
to trust me .
yes , sir .
i will , sir .
i mean , i do , sir .
i hope so .
repatch the main ac to the hard drives and stand by to broadcast .
yes , sir .
still can' t sleep ?
you wanna talk ?
they' re just dreams .
if you' re afraid of something ...
i just wish ...
i wish i knew what i' m supposed to do .
that' s all .
i just wish i knew .
she' s gonna call .
don' t worry .
here you are .
are we ready to go ?
we' re already late .
these geotherms confirm the last transmission of the osiris .
the machines are digging .
they' re boring from the surface down to zion .
mother ...
they' il avoid the perimeter defense .
how fast are they moving ?
control estimates their descent at 100 meters an hour .
how deep are they ?
almost 2000 meters .
what about the scans from the osiris ?
they can' t be accurate .
they may be .
it' s not possible .
that' d mean there are a quarter million sentinels .
that' s right .
that can' t be .
why not ?
a sentinel for every man , woman and child in zion .
that sounds exactly like the thinking of a machine to me .
morpheus , glad you could join us .
niobe .
my apologies to all .
but as you are undoubtedly aware ... ... it' s become difficult to locate a secure broadcast position .
squiddies got our best spots .
lines are crawling with them .
and if niobe' s right , in 72 hours there' s gonna be a quarter million more .
what are we gonna do ?
we' re gonna do what commander lock ordered .
we' il evacuate broadcast level and return to zion .
and does the commander have a plan for stopping 250, 000 sentinels ?
a strategy is still being formulated .
i' m sure it is .
what do you think we should do , morpheus ?
we should proceed as ordered ...
what is it ?
i don' t know . ... however , i must ask one of you for help .
some of you believe as i believe , some of you do not .
those of you that do ... ... know we are nearing the end of our struggle .
the prophecy will be fulfilled soon .
but before it can be ... ... the oracle must be consulted .
if we return and recharge now ... ... we can be back in 36 hours , well before the machines reach this depth .
do you understand what you' re asking ?
i am asking that one ship remain here in our place ... ... in case the oracle should attempt to contact us .
bullshit .
you' re asking one of us to disobey a direct order .
that' s right , i am .
but we well know that the reason most of us are here ... ... is because of our affinity for disobedience .
what happens when you get back to zion ... ... and the commander throws you in the stockade ?
he won' t .
goddamn it , morpheus , you ain' t never gonna change .
shit , i' il do it just to see what deadbolt does to you .
you got 36 hours .
i' m looking for neo .
never heard of him .
i have something for him .
a gift .
you see , he set me free .
fine , whatever .
now piss off .
who was that ?
how did you know someone was here ?
he gave you this .
he said you set him free .
is everything all right , sir ?
the meeting is over .
retreat to your exits .
agents are coming .
agents ?
go .
hiya , fellas .
it' s him .
the anomaly .
do we proceed ?
yes .
he is still ...
only human .
upgrades .
that went as expected .
yes .
it' s happening exactly as before .
well , not exactly .
what happened ?
i can' t figure it out .
agents just came out of nowhere .
then the code got all weird .
encryption i' ve never seen .
is neo okay ?
okay ?
shit , you should' ve seen him .
where is he now ?
he' s doing his superman thing .
where are you ?
this is the nebuchadnezzar , requesting access through gate three .
nebuchadnezzar , this is zion control .
maintain present velocity and stand by .
roger that , control .
this is control requesting immediate stand down of arms at gate three .
we have the nebuchadnezzar on approach .
let' s open her up .
you are cleared through gate three to bay seven .
roger that , control .
door' s open , bed' s made .
welcome home .
no place like it .
roger that , control .
zion control , stand by for gate three lockdown .
the nebuchadnezzar is down .
bay seven .
understood .
captain mifune .
captain morpheus .
are you here to escort me to the stockade , captain ?
i' m just here to keep the peace .
commander lock demands ...
requests your immediate counsel , sir .
link .
sir ?
i want the ship ready to go as soon as possible .
understood , sir .
what is it between them ?
morpheus and lock ?
niobe .
captain niobe ?
she used to be with morpheus .
now she' s with lock .
what happened ?
morpheus went to the oracle .
after that , everything changed .
yeah , she can do that .
neo !
oh , no .
how does he always know ?
doesn' t he have anything better to do ?
you know what they say about the life you save .
i didn' t save his life .
hiya , neo .
trinity , link .
hey .
it' s great to have you back .
thanks .
it' s good to be back .
can i carry that for you ?
no , i can carry my own bag .
trinity ?
i' m fine .
you can carry these .
yeah , sure , link .
hey , you know , next year i' m old enough to join a crew , right ?
i' ve been thinking about it , and i' ve made my decision .
let me guess .
i want to join the nebuchadnezzar .
morpheus hasn' t filled the other positions , except for you , link .
i' m sure he has reasons ... ... but the more i think about it , the more i think it' s meant to be .
you know , it' s fate .
you' re the reason i' m here , neo .
i told you , you found me .
i didn' t find you .
i know , but you got me out .
you saved me .
you saved yourself .
morpheus .
commander lock .
i spoke to the other captains .
i wanted to offer you a chance to explain your actions .
i wasn' t aware that my actions required any explanation .
you were given an order to return to zion .
i did .
you asked for one ship to remain behind .
i would have stayed , but i needed to recharge my ship .
so you admit to a direct contravention of your duty .
we need a presence inside the matrix to await contact from the oracle .
i don' t want to hear that shit !
i don' t care about oracles or prophecies or messiahs !
stopping that army from destroying this city .
to do that i need soldiers to obey my orders .
with all due respect , commander , there is only one way to save our city .
how ?
neo .
goddamn it , morpheus .
not everyone believes what you believe .
my beliefs do not require them to .
there' s a gathering tonight .
everyone' s talking .
a lot of people are scared .
no one remembers the last time so many ships were docked .
something big is happening , isn' t it ?
hey .
we' re not allowed to say anything , so stop asking .
goddamn , it' s good to be home .
i' m recommending that you be removed from duty .
that is , of course , your prerogative , commander .
if it were up to me , you wouldn' t set foot on a ship for the rest of your life .
then i am grateful that it is not up to you .
councillor hamann .
commander .
captain .
councillor .
council' s asked me to speak tonight at the temple gathering .
the presence of the fleet and the persistence of rumors must be addressed .
the people must be told what is happening .
of course , councillor .
but might i advise a level of discretion concerning specific details .
we do not wish to start a panic .
quite right .
a panic is not what anyone wants .
what about you , captain ?
what would you advise ?
the truth .
no one will panic , because there is nothing to fear .
that army won' t reach the gates of zion .
what makes you so sure ?
consider what we have seen , councillor .
consider that in the past six months ... ... we have freed more minds than in six years .
this attack is an act of desperation .
i believe very soon the prophecy will be fulfilled and this war will end .
i hope you' re right , captain .
i do not believe it to be a matter of hope , councillor .
it is simply a matter of time .
my stop .
see you soon .
hopefully not too soon .
let' s go , kid .
these two got things to do .
are you thinking what i' m thinking ?
i am if you' re thinking this elevator is too slow .
how long do we charge the neb ?
twenty four , maybe 30 hours .
some people go their entire lives without hearing news that good .
neo , please , i have a son , jacob , aboard the gnosis .
please , watch over him .
i' il try .
i have a daughter on the icarus .
no , wait .
it' s all right .
they need you .
i need you .
i know .
there' s time .
where' s my puss ... ?
hey !
uncle link !
god !
uncle link !
oh , my god !
you' re so huge !
you should be picking me up !
no !
yeah !
okay !
okay ?
all right .
now , we' re gonna have to work together here , okay ?
one , two , three , lift !
oh , my god !
what are you feeding these two ?
come on , kids .
it' s time to go .
hey , cas .
hey .
good to have you home , link .
good to be home .
you be careful with her .
don' t worry about me .
he' s the one that' s gonna get it .
out the door !
both of you , march !
bye !
bye !
i' m gonna get what ?
every ship up there' s been home two , even three times more than the nebuchadnezzar .
come on , zee .
i thought we were past this .
we' il be when you operate another ship .
i can' t do that .
why ?
you know why .
if dozer knew how i felt , he wouldn' t have asked you to do this .
maybe .
but it' s too late now .
i made a promise , and some promises can' t be unmade .
it' s not fair .
nobody said it was gonna be .
you think cas thinks it' s fair that i' m here and dozer' s not ?
i lost two brothers to that ship , link .
i' m afraid of it .
i' m afraid it' s gonna take you too .
it won' t .
how can you say that to me ?
because of morpheus .
because of what he' s told me .
he said that this is it , that it will be over soon .
link , morpheus is crazy .
no doubt .
but tank and dozer believed him .
and i' il tell you what ... ... after being on that ship and seeing neo do the things he can do , i gotta say ... ... i' m starting to believe him too .
be careful , link .
please be careful .
they started yet ?
only councillor hamann' s opening prayer .
tonight , let us honor these men and women .
these are our soldiers , our warriors .
these are our husbands and wives , our brothers and sisters ... ... our children .
let us remember those that have been lost ... ... and let us give thanks for those that have been found ... ... and who stand here beside us .
now i would like someone else to close this prayer ... ... someone who hasn' t spoken here in a long time ... ... but who i believe has something to say that we all need to hear .
i give you morpheus .
zion !
hear me !
it is true what many of you have heard .
the machines have gathered an army , and as i speak ... ... that army is drawing nearer to our home .
believe me when i say we have a difficult time ahead of us .
but if we are to be prepared for it , we must first shed our fear of it .
i stand here before you now truthfully unafraid .
why ?
because i believe something you do not ?
no !
i stand here without fear because i remember .
i remember that i am here not because of the path that lies before me ... ... but because of the path that lies behind me .
i remember that for 100 years we have fought these machines .
i remember that for 100 years they have sent their armies to destroy us .
we are still here !
tonight ... ... let us send a message to that army .
tonight , let us shake this cave .
tonight , let us tremble these halls ... ... of earth , steel and stone .
let us be heard from red core to black sky .
this is zion and we are not afraid !
i remember .
i remember you used to dance .
i remember you were pretty good .
there are some things in this world , captain niobe ... ... that will never change .
niobe !
some things do change .
excuse me .
i missed you .
i can tell .
i was thinking , everyone is here .
follow me .
neo , what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
it' s okay , you can tell me .
trinity ...
don' t be afraid .
i can' t lose you .
you' re not gonna lose me .
you feel this ?
i' m never letting go .
good night , zion .
sweet dreams .
you all right ?
i' il make it .
did you see that agent ?
i' ve never seen anything like that .
it doesn' t matter .
all that matters is this .
you first .
oh , god .
" smith " will suffice .
thank you .
my pleasure .
care for some company ?
councillor hamann .
i don' t want to intrude if you' d prefer to be alone .
no , i could probably use some company .
good .
so could i.
it' s nice tonight .
very calm .
it feels like everyone is sleeping very peacefully .
not everyone .
i hate sleeping .
i never sleep more than a few hours .
i figure i slept the first 11 years of my life , now i' m making up for it .
what about you ?
i just haven' t been able to sleep much .
it' s a good sign .
of what ?
that you are in fact still human .
have you ever been to the engineering level ?
i love to walk there at night .
it' s quite amazing .
would you like to see it ?
sure .
almost no one comes down here .
unless , of course , there' s a problem .
that' s how it is with people .
nobody cares how it works as long as it works .
i like it down here .
i like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines .
these machines are keeping us alive while other machines are coming to kill us .
interesting , isn' t it ?
the power to give life ...
... and the power to end it .
we have the same power .
yeah , i suppose we do , but ... ... sometimes i think about those people still plugged into the matrix .
and when i look at these machines ... ... i can' t help thinking that , in a way , we are plugged into them .
but we control these machines , they don' t control us .
of course not .
how could they ?
the idea is pure nonsense ... ... but it does make one wonder just ... ... what is control ?
if we wanted , we could shut these machines down .
of course .
that' s it .
you hit it .
that' s control , isn' t it ?
if we wanted , we could smash them to bits .
although if we did , we' d have to consider what would happen to our lights ... ... our heat , our air .
so we need machines and they need us .
is that your point , councillor ?
no .
no point .
old men like me don' t bother with making points .
there' s no point .
is that why there are no young men on the council ?
good point .
why don' t you tell me what' s on your mind , councillor .
there is so much in this world ... ... that i do not understand .
see that machine ?
it has something to do with recycling our water supply .
i have absolutely no idea how it works .
but i do understand the reason for it to work .
i have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do .
but i believe there' s a reason for that as well .
i only hope we understand that reason before it' s too late .
ballard .
is he here ?
neo , it' s from the oracle .
it' s time to go .
morpheus said this was how it was gonna happen .
i don' t know .
maybe the prophecy' s true , maybe it' s not .
all i know is , that ship needs an operator .
right now , that operator' s me .
i know .
zee ...
i want you to wear it .
you know i don' t believe in this stuff .
but i do .
it' s always brought me luck .
maybe it' il bring me you .
i' m coming back .
i promise .
no matter what it takes , i' m coming home .
just keep it with you .
please .
for me .
okay .
neo !
how the hell ... ?
bane .
is something wrong ?
no , i' m fine .
i just wanted to catch you to say ... ... good luck .
thanks .
we' il see you .
neo !
just in time .
you' re gonna see the oracle ?
there' s no time .
i had to give something to neo .
a gift from one of the orphans .
he made me swear to get it to you before you left .
he said you' d understand .
thanks .
i was just told you cleared the nebuchadnezzar for takeoff .
that is correct .
am i still in charge of our defense system ?
of course .
i believe i need every ship we have if we' re going to survive this attack .
i understand that , commander .
then why did you allow the nebuchadnezzar to leave ?
because i believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have .
be careful .
hello .
you seek the oracle .
who are you ?
i am seraph .
i can take you to her , but first i must apologize .
apologize for what ?
for this .
good .
the oracle has many enemies .
i had to be sure .
of what ?
that you are the one .
you could have just asked .
no .
you do not truly know someone ... ... until you fight them .
come .
she' s waiting .
where the hell did they go ?
these are back doors , aren' t they ?
programmer access .
how do they work ?
a code is hidden in tumblers .
one position opens a lock and another position opens one of these doors .
are you a programmer ?
then what are you ?
i protect that which matters most .
well , come on .
i ain' t gonna bite you .
come around here and let me have a look at you .
my goodness , look at you .
you turned out all right , didn' t you ?
how do you feel ?
i ...
i know you' re not sleeping .
we' il get to that .
why don' t you come and have a sit this time .
maybe i' il stand .
well , suit yourself .
i felt like sitting .
i know .
so ... ... let' s get the obvious stuff out of the way .
you' re not human , are you ?
it' s tough to get more obvious than that .
if i had to guess , i' d say you' re a program from the machine world .
so is he .
so far , so good .
but if that' s true , that could mean you' re part of this system ... ... another kind of control .
keep going .
i suppose the most obvious question is ...
... how can i trust you ?
bingo .
it is a pickle , no doubt about it .
bad news is ... ... there' s no way you can really know if i' m here to help you or not .
so it' s really up to you .
just have to make up your own damn mind ... ... to either accept what i' m going to tell you or reject it .
candy ?
do you already know if i' il take it ?
wouldn' t be much of an oracle if i didn' t .
but if you already know , how can i make a choice ?
because you didn' t come here to make the choice .
you' ve already made it .
you' re here to try to understand why you made it .
i thought you' d have figured that out by now .
why are you here ?
same reason .
i love candy .
but why help us ?
we' re all here to do what we' re all here to do .
i' m interested in one thing , neo : the future .
and believe me , i know , the only way to get there is together .
are there other programs like you ?
well , not like me , but ...
look .
see those birds ?
at some point , a program was written to govern them .
a program was written to watch over the trees and the wind , the sunrise and sunset .
there are programs running all over the place .
the ones doing their job , doing what they were meant to do , are invisible .
you' d never even know they were here .
but the other ones ...
well , you hear about them all the time .
i' ve never heard of them .
of course you have .
every time you' ve heard someone say they saw a ghost or an angel ... ... every story you' ve ever heard about vampires , werewolves or aliens ... ... is the system assimilating some program ... ... that' s doing something they' re not supposed to be doing .
programs hacking programs .
why ?
they have their reasons ... ... but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion .
and why would a program be deleted ?
maybe it breaks down .
maybe a better program is created to replace it .
happens all the time .
and when it does , a program can either choose to hide here ... ... or return to the source .
the machine mainframe .
yes .
where you must go .
where the path of the one ends .
you' ve seen it ... ... in your dreams , haven' t you ?
a door made of light ?
what happens when you go through the door ?
i see trinity ... ... and something happens ... ... something bad .
she starts to fall , and then i wake up .
do you see her die ?
no .
you have the sight now , neo .
you are looking at the world without time .
then why can' t i see what happens to her ?
we can never see past the choices we don' t understand .
are you saying i have to choose whether trinity lives or dies ?
no , you' ve already made the choice .
now you have to understand it .
no .
i can' t do that .
i won' t .
well , you have to .
why ?
because you' re the one .
what if i can' t ?
what happens if i fail ?
then zion will fall .
our time is up .
listen to me , neo .
you can save zion ... ... if you reach the source , but to do that you need the keymaker .
the keymaker ?
he disappeared .
we didn' t know what happened to him until now .
he' s being held prisoner by a very dangerous program ... ... one of the oldest of us .
he is called the merovingian .
and he won' t let him go willingly .
what does he want ?
what do all men with power want ?
more power .
be there at that exact time ... ... and you will have a chance .
we must go .
seems like every time we meet i got nothing but bad news .
i' m sorry about that .
i surely am .
but for what it' s worth ... ... you' ve made a believer out of me .
good luck , kiddo .
mr. anderson .
did you get my package ?
yeah .
well , good .
smith ?
he' s not reading like an agent .
surprised to see me ?
no .
then you' re aware of it .
of what ?
our connection .
i don' t fully understand how it happened .
perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me ... ... something overwritten or copied .
it is , at this point , irrelevant .
what matters is ... ... that whatever happened , happened for a reason .
and what reason is that ?
i killed you , mr. anderson .
i watched you die .
with a certain satisfaction , i might add .
and then something happened , something that i knew was impossible ... ... but it happened anyway .
you destroyed me , mr. anderson .
afterward , i knew the rules , i understood what i was supposed to do ... ... but i didn' t .
i couldn' t .
i was compelled to stay ... ... compelled to disobey .
and now , here i stand because of you , mr. anderson .
because of you , i' m no longer an agent of this system .
because of you , i' ve changed .
i' m unplugged .
a new man , so to speak .
like you , apparently free .
congratulations .
thank you .
but as you well know , appearances can be deceiving ... ... which brings me back to the reason why we' re here .
we' re not here because we' re free .
we' re here because we are not free .
there' s no escaping reason , no denying purpose .
because as we both know , without purpose ...
... we would not exist .
it is purpose that created us .
purpose that connects us .
purpose that pulls us .
that guides us .
that drives us .
it is purpose that defines .
purpose that binds us .
we are here because of you , mr. anderson .
purpose .
what' s happening to him ?
don' t know .
yes , that' s it .
it' il be over soon .
you .
yes , me .
me , me , me .
me too .
more .
it is inevitable .
come on , get out of there .
are you all right ?
it was smith .
yes .
now there' s more than one of them ?
a lot more .
how is that possible ?
i don' t know .
somehow , he' s found a way to copy himself .
is that what he was doing to you ?
i don' t know what he was doing ...
... but i know what it felt like .
what ?
it felt like i was back in that hallway .
it felt like dying .
the machines are tunneling to avoid our defense system .
but i believe they will intersect certain pipelines to control them .
these points of intersection are crucial ... ... because i believe they' re vulnerable to counterattack .
although it has been suggested that this is the same kind of attack ... ... we' ve defended for years , i urge the council to realize the truth .
this is the single greatest threat we have ever faced ... ... and if we do not act accordingly , we will not survive .
commander lock , the council is well aware of the seriousness of this attack .
you have our leave to prepare our defense by any and all means necessary .
thank you , council .
however ... ... we ask if there' s been word from the nebuchadnezzar .
no , councillor .
no word .
nothing .
then we request a ship be dispatched to ascertain the fate of the one .
i wish that were possible , councillor , but i do not believe our defense ...
... can suffer the loss of another ship .
it will , commander , if it must .
it could take one ship days to find the nebuchadnezzar .
then send two .
this is insane .
careful , commander .
forgive my frustration , councillors .
but i wish i were able to comprehend the council' s choice in this matter .
comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation .
if you are asking me to order two of my captains ...
there' s no need for such an order .
the captains are present .
they can answer for themselves .
the council is calling for two volunteers to aid the nebuchadnezzar .
are there two among you that would answer such a call ?
captain soren of the vigilant will answer the council' s call .
you understand the situation , captain soren ?
yes , ma' am .
thank you , captain .
is there another ?
captain , i think we should volunteer .
what ?
you have gone crazy .
listen ...
shut your hole , bane ... ... before i put you in one .
is there no other ?
be hard for any man to risk his life ... ... especially if he doesn' t understand the reason .
captain niobe of the logos will answer the councillor' s call .
what ?
thank you , captain niobe .
commander lock , you have your orders .
this council is hereby adjourned .
niobe , what are you doing ?
what i can .
why ?
because some things never change , jason ... ... and some things do .
what can you see , neo ?
it' s strange .
the code is somehow different .
encrypted ?
maybe .
is that good for us or bad for us ?
well , it looks like every floor is wired with explosives .
bad for us .
here we go .
yes .
we are here to speak with the merovingian .
well , of course .
he has been expecting you .
follow me .
here he is at last .
neo , the one himself .
right ?
and the legendary morpheus .
and trinity , of course .
i have heard so much .
you honor me .
please , sit .
join us .
this is my wife , persephone .
something to eat ?
drink ?
of course , such things are contrivances , like so much here .
for the sake of appearances .
no , thank you .
yes , of course .
who has time ?
who has time ?
but then , if we do not ever take time , how can we ever have time ?
chteau haut briond , 1959 .
magnificent wine .
i love french wine like i love the french language .
i have sampled every language .
french is my favorite .
fantastic language ... ... especially to curse with .
you see ?
it' s like wiping your ass with silk .
i love it .
you know why we are here .
i am a trafficker of information .
i know everything i can .
the question is , do you know why you are here ?
we are looking for the keymaker .
oh , yes , it is true .
the keymaker , of course .
but this is not a reason , this is not a why .
the keymaker himself , his very nature , is a means , it is not an end .
and so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do ...
... what ?
you know the answer to that question .
but do you ?
you think you do , but you do not .
you are here because you were sent here .
you were told to come here , and then you obeyed .
it is , of course , the way of all things .
you see , there is only one constant ... ... one universal .
it is the only real truth .
causality .
action , reaction .
cause and effect .
everything begins with choice .
no .
wrong .
choice is an illusion created between those with power ... ... and those without .
look there at that woman .
my god , just look at her ... ... affecting everyone around her .
so obvious , so bourgeois , so boring .
but wait .
watch .
you see , i have sent her a dessert ... ... a very special dessert .
i wrote it myself .
it starts so simply ... ... each line of the program creating a new effect , just like ... ... poetry .
first ... ... a rush , heat .
her heart flutters .
you can see it , neo , yes ?
she does not understand why .
is it the wine ?
no .
what is it then ?
what is the reason ?
and soon it does not matter .
soon the why and the reason are gone ... ... and all that matters is the feeling itself .
and this is the nature of the universe .
we struggle against it , we fight to deny it ... ... but it is , of course , pretense .
it is a lie .
beneath our poised appearance ... ... the truth is , we are completely ... ... out of control .
causality .
there is no escape from it .
we are forever slaves to it .
our only hope , our only peace , is to understand it , to understand the why .
why " is what separates us from them ... ... you from me .
why " is the only real source of power .
without it , you are powerless .
and this is how you come to me , without why , without power .
another link in the chain .
but fear not .
since i have seen how good you are at following orders ... ... i will tell you what to do next .
her time is almost up .
now i have some real business to do , so i will say adieu and goodbye .
this isn' t over .
oh , yes , it is .
the keymaker is mine , and i see no reason why i should give him up .
no reason at all .
where are you going ?
please , ma chrie , i have told you .
we are all victims of causality .
i drank too much wine , i must take a piss .
cause and effect .
au revoir .
touch me and that hand will never touch anything again .
well , that didn' t go so well .
are you certain the oracle didn' t say anything else ?
yes .
maybe we did something wrong .
or didn' t do something .
no , what happened couldn' t have happened any other way .
how do you know ?
we are still alive .
if you want the keymaker , follow me .
get out .
i am so sick and tired of his bullshit .
on and on .
pompous prick .
a long time ago , when we first came here , it was so different .
he was so different .
he was like you .
i' il give you what you want , but you have to give me something .
what ?
a kiss .
excuse me ?
i want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her .
why ?
you love her .
she loves you .
it' s all over you both .
a long time ago , i knew what that felt like .
i want to remember it .
i want to sample it .
that' s all .
just a sample .
why don' t you sample this instead ?
trinity .
such emotion over something so small .
it' s just a kiss .
why should we trust you ?
if i don' t deliver you to the keymaker , she can kill me .
all right .
but you have to make me believe i am her .
all right .
terrible .
forget it .
wait .
okay .
yes .
that' s it .
i envy you .
but such a thing is not meant to last .
come with me .
not again .
it' s all right , boys .
they' re with me .
these fellas work for my husband .
they do his dirty work .
they' re very good , very ioyal .
aren' t you , boys ?
yes , mistress .
they come from a much older version of the matrix .
but like so many back then , they caused more problems than they solved .
my husband saved them because they' re notoriously difficult to terminate .
how many people keep silver bullets in their gun ?
you can either run and tell my husband what i have done ... ... or you can stay there and die .
he' s in the ladies ' room !
hurry .
my name is neo .
yes .
i' m the keymaker .
i' ve been waiting for you .
my god !
my god , persephone , how could you do this ?
you betray me .
cause and effect , my love .
cause ?
there is no cause for this .
what cause ?
what cause ?
how about the lipstick you' re still wearing ?
lipstick ?
lipstick .
what craziness are you talking about , woman ?
there is no lipstick !
she wasn' t kissing your face , my love .
woman , this is nothing .
it is a game .
it is only a game .
so is this .
have fun .
all right .
all right .
let us find out where this goes .
you two , get the keymaker .
that' s a nice trick .
i cannot go back .
i' il handle them .
handle us ?
you' il handle us ?
you know , your predecessors had much more respect .
okay , you have some skill .
kill him .
you see ?
he' s just a man .
goddamn it , woman , you will be the end of me .
mark my words , boy , and mark them well .
i have survived your predecessors , and i will survive you .
where are you going ?
another way .
always another way .
close it , quick !
could we move along ?
run !
step away from the door .
we owe you for that .
just like new .
drop your weapon .
stay with him .
what about neo ?
he can handle himself .
get in back .
shit .
operator .
link , where am i ?
you won' t believe this , but you' re way up in the mountains .
really ?
it' il take me a while to get an exit .
shit !
what ?
the twins are after morpheus and trinity .
they don' t have a way out .
where are they ?
middle of the city , 500 miles due south .
operator .
get us out of here .
won' t be easy .
i know .
we' re inside the core network .
the only exit i got near you is the winslow overpass .
off the freeway .
yes , sir .
fine , we' il make it .
i should ...
oh , shit !
look out behind you !
incoming fire .
down !
hold on !
oh , no .
this is getting real ugly real fast .
are you watching this , link ?
yes , sir .
there' s an all points on you .
eight units headed your way .
any suggestions ?
turn right .
right , now .
straight here .
you' il hit a connecting tunnel to the 101 .
got it .
you sure about this ?
the freeway , i mean .
in 14 years of operating , i' ve never seen ...
link , what did i tell you ?
yes , sir .
i do , sir .
winslow overpass .
i' il be ready for you .
good man .
you always told me to stay off the freeway .
yes , that' s true .
you said it was suicide .
then let us hope ... ... that i was wrong .
operator .
link , it' s niobe .
we' ve been sent to bring you in .
i need to talk to morpheus .
believe me , niobe , he needs you .
where is he ?
just follow the sirens .
repeat , they' re approaching the ...
we have them now .
the exile is the primary target .
shots fired .
move !
we are getting aggravated .
yes , we are .
trinity .
get him out of here .
come on !
crush him .
morpheus .
he' s okay .
keep moving .
let' s go .
i need a download to hot wire a motorcycle .
no problem .
one crash course on motorcycle ...
wait .
cancel that .
you are handy .
jump on .
she means nothing .
find the exile .
we have them .
one adam 12 , please respond .
get down .
gotcha .
she' s good .
you are no longer necessary .
we do only what we' re meant to do .
then you are meant for one more thing : deletion .
go kick his ass .
neo , if you' re out there , i could use some help .
what is that ?
yes !
yes !
we have confirmation from the icarus .
first two ships are in position for counterattack .
good .
any change ?
they hit some iron ore here .
slowed them down a little .
how much ?
an hour , maybe .
that would give them a little over nine hours .
yes , sir .
there is a building .
inside this building , there is a level where no elevator can go ... ... and no stair can reach .
this level is filled with doors .
these doors lead to many places .
hidden places .
but one door is special .
one door leads to the source .
this building is protected by a very secure system .
every alarm triggers the bomb .
bomb ?
did he say bomb ?
but like all systems , it has a weakness .
the system is based on the rules of a building .
one system built on another .
electricity .
lf one fails , so must the other .
no electricity , no alarms .
you' d have to take out a city block to kill the power .
not one , 27 .
twenty seven blocks ?
there is a power station .
it must be destroyed .
there must be some kind of fail safe .
yes , there is an emergency system .
the core network of the grid must be accessed .
the emergency system must be deactivated .
what do you need us for ?
neo could take them out easier than we could .
there' s no time .
why ?
once the door is unprotected , the connection will be severed .
but another connection must first be made .
how long will that take ?
exactly 314 seconds .
just over five minutes .
that is the length and breadth of the window .
only the one can open the door ... ... and only during that window can the door be opened .
how do you know all this ?
i know because i must know .
it is my purpose .
it' s the reason i' m here , the same reason we' re all here .
neo , i know something' s wrong .
you don' t have to tell me .
i just want you to know that i' m here .
all must be done as one .
can' t hurt .
if one fails ... ... all fail .
at midnight , there is a shift change in the security of both buildings .
at midnight , we will strike .
hey !
you count sheep at home .
why ?
i get paid to count them here .
okay , they' re inside .
how much time ?
twelve minutes .
oh , shit .
all of our lives , we have fought this war .
tonight , i believe we can end it .
tonight is not an accident .
there are no accidents .
we have not come here by chance .
i do not believe in chance .
when i see three objectives , three captains , three ships ... ... i do not see coincidence .
i see providence .
i see purpose .
i believe it is our fate to be here .
it is our destiny .
i believe this night holds for each and every one of us ... ... the very meaning of our lives .
i want to ask you to do something , but i don' t know how .
i promise you , if i can , i will .
what if i asked you to stay out of this ... ... no matter what ... ... to stay out of the matrix ?
why ?
please .
all right .
what is it , niobe ?
i can' t help it , morpheus .
i can' t help thinking , what if you' re wrong ?
what if all this , the prophecy , everything , is bullshit ?
then tomorrow we may all be dead .
but how would that be different from any other day ?
this is a war , and we are soldiers .
death can come for us at any time ... ... in any place .
incoming .
incoming !
incoming !
now consider the alternative .
what if i am right ?
what if the prophecy is true ?
what if tomorrow the war could be over ?
isn' t that worth fighting for ?
isn' t that worth dying for ?
time ?
three minutes .
almost there .
it is done .
find the others .
i got niobe there .
they' re out of the station .
what about soren ?
there .
they' re still inside , but ...
they' re not moving .
that' s it , let' s go .
call neo now .
i lost them .
they' re inside the portal .
what about the grid ?
everything is operational .
the emergency system is rerouting power .
jesus .
soon as they open that door , it' s all over .
the hell it is .
what are you ... ?
trinity !
i will not wait and do nothing .
i will not watch them die .
we' re talking less than five minutes .
in five minutes , i' il tear that building down .
how much further ?
here , just here .
i' m sorry , this is a dead end .
it' s gotta be the ugliest hack i have ever done .
that' s as close as i can get you .
you better grow wings .
operator .
i' m in .
keep moving .
sixty fifth floor .
you look surprised to see me again , mr. anderson .
well , that' s the difference between us .
i have been expecting you .
what do you want , smith ?
you haven' t figured that out ?
still using all the muscles except the one that matters .
i want exactly what you want .
i want everything .
would that include a bullet from this gun ?
go ahead , shoot .
the best thing about being me , there' s so many me' s .
christ !
what the hell happened in here ?
hold it right there , little lady .
if you can' t beat us ...
join us .
morpheus !
still no sight of them .
they only got two minutes left .
one minute .
come on .
come on .
please .
kill them .
they' re in .
i don' t believe it .
it was meant to be .
morpheus , that door will take you home .
you will know which door .
hurry , neo .
trinity , i got some serious activity headed your way .
hello , neo .
who are you ?
i am the architect .
i created the matrix .
i' ve been waiting for you .
you have many questions .
though the process has altered your consciousness ... ... you remain irrevocably human .
ergo , some of my answers you will understand and some you will not .
concordantly , while your first question may be the most pertinent ... ... you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant .
why am i here ?
your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation ... ... inherent to the programming of the matrix .
you are the eventuality of an anomaly , which despite my sincerest efforts ... ... i' ve been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise ... ... a harmony of mathematical precision .
while it remains a burden assiduously avoided ... ... it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control ... ... which has led you , inexorably ... ... here .
you haven' t answered my question .
quite right .
interesting .
that was quicker than the others .
others ?
how many ?
what others ?
the matrix is older than you know .
i count from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next .
in which case , this is the sixth version .
five before me ?
he' s lying .
bullshit .
there are only two possible explanations .
there were five before me .
either no one told me ... ... or no one knows .
precisely .
as you are undoubtedly gathering , the anomaly is systemic ... ... creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations .
you can' t control me !
i' m gonna smash you to bits !
i' m gonna fucking kill you !
you can' t make me do anything .
you old , white prick !
choice .
the problem is choice .
the first matrix i designed was naturally perfect , a work of art .
flawless , sublime .
a triumph equaled only by its monumental failure .
the inevitability of its doom is apparent now ... ... as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human .
thus , i redesigned it based on your history ... ... to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature .
however , i was again frustrated by failure .
i have come to understand that the answer eluded me ... ... because it required a lesser mind .
or perhaps , a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection .
thus , the answer was stumbled upon by another , an intuitive program ... ... initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche .
if i am the father of the matrix , she would undoubtedly be its mother .
the oracle .
please .
as i was saying , she stumbled upon a solution whereby 99 percent of subjects ... ... accepted the program , as long as they were given a choice ... ... even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level .
while this answer functioned , it was fundamentally flawed ... ... thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly ... ... that , if left unchecked , might threaten the system .
ergo , those that refused the program , while a minority , if unchecked ... ... would constitute an escalating probability of disaster .
this is about zion .
you are here because zion is about to be destroyed .
its every living inhabitant terminated , its entire existence eradicated .
bullshit .
denial is the most predictable of all human responses .
but rest assured , this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it ... ... and we have become exceedingly efficient at it .
the function of the one ... ... is now to return to the source , allowing a dissemination of the code you carry ... ... reinserting the prime program .
after which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals ... ... sixteen female , seven male , to rebuild zion .
failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash ... ... killing everyone connected to the matrix ... ... which , coupled with the extermination of zion ... ... will result in the extinction of the entire human race .
you won' t let it happen .
you can' t .
you need human beings to survive .
there are levels of survival we are prepared to accept .
the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready ... ... to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world .
it is interesting reading your reactions .
your five predecessors were , by design , based on a similar predication ... ... a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment ... ... to the rest of your species , facilitating the function of the one .
while the others experience this in a general way ... ... your experience is far more specific ... ... vis vis love .
trinity !
apropos , she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own .
no .
which brings us at last to the moment of truth , wherein the fundamental flaw ... ... is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed ... ... as both beginning and end .
there are two doors .
the door to your right leads to the source and the salvation of zion .
the door to your left leads back to the matrix , to her and the end of your species .
as you adequately put , the problem is choice .
but we already know what you are going to do , don' t we ?
already i can see the chain reaction , the chemical precursors that signal ... ... the onset of an emotion designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason .
she is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it .
hope .
it is the quintessential human delusion , simultaneously ... ... the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness .
if i were you , i would hope that we don' t meet again .
we won' t .
we got a serious situation , sir .
oh , no .
what was that ?
it' s moving faster than anything i' ve seen .
holy shit , he caught her .
neo , i had to .
i know .
the bullet is still inside .
trinity ... ... don' t you quit on me now .
i' m sorry .
trinity .
trinity ... ... i know you can hear me .
i' m not letting go .
i can' t .
i love you too damn much .
i can' t take this .
i guess this makes us even .
i don' t understand it .
everything was done as it was supposed to be done .
once the one reaches the source , the war should be over .
in 24 hours , it will be .
what ?
if we don' t do something in 24 hours , zion will be destroyed .
what ?
how do you know that ?
i was told it would happen .
by whom ?
it doesn' t matter .
i believed him .
that' s impossible .
the prophecy tells us ...
it was a lie , morpheus .
the prophecy was a lie .
the one was never meant to end anything .
it was all another system of control .
i don' t believe that .
but you said it yourself .
how can the prophecy be true if the war isn' t over ?
i' m sorry .
i know it isn' t easy to hear , but ... ... i swear to you it' s the truth .
what are we gonna do ?
i don' t know .
oh , no !
what are they doing ?
they' re just out of emp range .
it' s a bomb .
we have to get out of here .
now .
i have dreamed a dream ... ... but now that dream has gone from me .
here they come .
let' s go , morpheus .
we won' t make it .
we have to try .
come on !
something' s different .
what ?
i can feel them .
neo !
what happened ?
i don' t know .
it' s the hammer .
he' s in some kind of coma ... ... but his vitals are stable .
what about you ?
i' m fine .
you could use some rest .
no , i' m gonna stay with him .
lock was right .
he guessed that the machines ... ... would cut off the mainlines in and out of zion .
he thought a counterattack might surprise them .
it sounded good .
i figured we had a shot ... ... until someone screwed it up .
an emp was triggered before we got in position .
five ships were instantly downed .
when the machines broke through ... ... it wasn' t a battle , it was a slaughter .
was it an accident ?
some sort of malfunction ?
no one knows .
someone does .
who ?
once the machines were done with us , they started digging again .
we made a quick pass to look for survivors .
you found one ?
only one .
everything that has a beginning ... ... has an end .
i see the end coming .
i see the darkness spreading .
i see death .
mr. anderson , welcome back .
we missed you .
it ends tonight .
you are all that stands in his way .
if you cannot stop him tonight , then i fear that tomorrow may never come .
