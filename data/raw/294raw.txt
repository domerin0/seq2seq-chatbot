i got nothing , sir .
no sign of niobe or ghost .
nothing but blue pills .
should we try to contact them ?
won' t matter .
my gut says they' re down .
we should start back .
lf that ship can fly , we need it .
i was afraid you' d say that .
search every pipe , every hole , every crack we know .
sweep as wide as possible , as fast as possible .
lines are crawling with calamari .
the sooner we find them the better .
thought you could use something to eat .
thank you .
any change ?
no .
how is he ?
he' s gonna be fine .
at least until he wakes up .
what do you mean ?
captain has some questions for him .
he' d better have some good answers .
you see these cuts ?
i think they' re self inflicted .
why ?
vdts maybe .
i don' t know .
but like i said , the answer better be good .
roland , i' d like to run another search through the matrix .
for what ?
for neo .
how could he be in the matrix , sir ?
he' s not plugged in .
please , for me .
this is what keeps bothering me .
what ?
his neural patterns don' t read like someone who' s in a coma .
the strange thing is , i see these patterns all the time .
where ?
on someone jacked in .
the big bupkes .
nada</ i> .
he' s not in there .
sir , i got the projections .
how long ?
based on point of entry and the past speed , the machines will be in zion in 20 hours .
jesus h. christ .
all right , let' s move with a purpose .
ak , i want you on holographics .
mauser , i want forward and aft guns manned at all times .
and make sure we are running on as few pads as possible .
hey !
you got a call .
what ?
operator .
it' s seraph .
i bring word from the oracle .
you must come at once .
good morning .
who are you ?
my name is sati .
your name is neo .
my papa says you' re not supposed to be here .
he says you must be lost .
are you lost , neo ?
where am i ?
this is the train station .
this isn' t the matrix ?
that' s where the train goes .
that' s where we' re going , but you cannot go with us .
why not ?
he won' t let you .
who won' t ?
the trainman .
i don' t like him .
but my papa says we have to do what the trainman says ... ... or else he will leave us here forever and ever .
morpheus , trinity , thank you for coming .
one thing i' ve learned in all my years ... ... is that nothing ever works out the way you want it to .
who are you ?
i' m the oracle .
i wish there was an easy way to get through this , but there ain' t .
i' m sorry this had to happen .
i' m sorry i couldn' t be sitting here like you remember me ...
... but it wasn' t meant to be .
what happened ?
i made a choice , and that choice cost me more than i wanted it to .
what choice ?
to help you , to guide neo .
now , since the real test for any choice is having to make the same choice again ... ... knowing full well what it might cost ... ... i guess i feel pretty good about that choice ... ... because here i am , at it again .
do you know what happened to neo ?
yes .
he is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world .
the link is controlled by a program called the trainman .
he uses it to smuggle programs in and out of the matrix .
if he finds out where neo is before you get to him ... ... then i' m afraid our choices are going to become difficult .
why ?
because of who the trainman works for .
the merovingian .
he has placed a bounty on your lives .
you must be careful at all times .
seraph knows how to find the trainman .
he' il go with you .
for years he has protected me .
i hope he can do the same for you .
please , follow me .
oracle ....
i know , morpheus .
i can see you' re filled with doubt , clouded by uncertainty .
after everything that has happened , how can you expect me to believe you ?
i don' t .
for you to make up your own damn mind .
believe me or don' t .
all i can do is tell you that your friend is in trouble , and he needs your help .
he needs all our help .
are you from the matrix ?
yes .
no .
i mean , i was .
why did you leave ?
i had to .
i had to leave my home too .
sati !
come here , darling .
leave the poor man in peace .
yes , papa .
i am sorry .
she is still very curious .
i know you .
yes , in the restaurant of the frenchman .
i am rama kandra .
this is my wife , kamala .
my daughter , sati .
we are most honored to meet you .
you are programs .
oh , yes .
i am the power plant systems manager for recycling operations .
my wife is an interactive software programmer .
she is highly creative .
what are you doing here ?
you do not belong here .
kamala !
goodness , i apologize .
my wife can be very direct .
it' s okay .
i don' t have an answer .
i don' t even know where " here " is .
this place is nowhere .
it is between your world and our world .
who' s the trainman ?
he works for the frenchman .
why did i know you would say that ?
the frenchman does not forget , and he does not forgive .
you know him ?
i know only what i need to know .
i know that if you want to take something from our world into your world ... ... that does not belong there , you must go to the frenchman .
is that what you' re doing here ?
rama , please .
i do not want to be cruel , kamala .
he may never see another face for the rest of his life .
i' m sorry .
you don' t have to answer that question .
no , i don' t mind .
the answer is simple .
i love my daughter very much .
i find her to be the most beautiful thing i have ever seen .
but where we are from , that is not enough .
every program that is created must have a purpose .
if it does not , it is deleted .
i went to the frenchman to save my daughter .
you do not understand .
i just have never
heard a program speak of love .
it is a human emotion .
no , it is a word .
what matters is the connection the word implies .
i see that you are in love .
can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection ?
anything .
then perhaps the reason you are here is not so different than the reason i am here .
that' s him .
get away !
get away from me !
we don' t want trouble .
get the hell away from me !
we need your help .
i can' t help you !
no one can help you !
oh , no !
damn it !
when is the train due ?
it is already late .
it' s not like the trainman to be late .
you think it has something to do with me ?
i cannot say .
who knows such things ?
only the oracle .
you know the oracle ?
everyone knows the oracle .
i consulted with her before i met with the frenchman .
she promised to watch sati after we said goodbye .
goodbye ?
you' re not staying with her ?
it is not possible .
our arrangement with the frenchman was for our daughter only .
my wife and i must return to our world .
why ?
that is our karma .
you believe in karma ?
karma is a word , like love .
what i am here to do .
i do not resent my karma .
i' m grateful for it .
grateful for my wonderful wife , for my beautiful daughter .
they are gifts , and so i do what i must do to honor them .
papa , the train !
yes .
find your bag .
quickly .
can i carry that for you ?
all right .
hurry it up , i' m late !
who are you ?
he is a friend .
i know you .
so that' s what they wanted .
i need to get back .
i' il pay you whatever you want .
one way or another , i' m getting on this train .
oh , no , no , no .
you' il stay here until the merovingian says different .
if i know him ... ... you' re gonna be here for a long , long time .
i don' t want to hurt you .
you don' t get it .
i built this place .
down here , i make the rules .
down here , i make the threats .
down here , i' m god .
get on the train or you' il stay here with him .
we should return to the oracle .
she will know what to do .
no .
we know what has to be done .
shit .
you gotta be kidding .
holy shit , it' s wingless .
i get it .
you must be ready to die .
i need to speak with him .
only way you' re getting through this door is over my big , dead ass .
so be it .
there are no weapons allowed in the club .
at the bottom of this elevator , there is a coat check girl ... ... and if we are lucky , one man for checking weapons .
and if we' re unlucky ?
there will be many men .
can i take your ?
oh , my god .
what in the hell ?
i don' t believe this .
hey !
the prodigal child returns .
are you here for the bounty , seraph ?
tell me , how many bullets are there in those guns ?
i don' t know , but i don' t think you have enough .
we only want to talk .
oh , yes .
i' m sure you do .
you have fought through hel to do so .
yes ?
i' il tell you what i will do .
put down the guns , and i will promise you a safe passage out of here .
all three of us ?
oh , yes , yes .
of course .
who could have guessed we would see each other so soon after our last meeting ?
the fates are too kind , eh ?
and since you , my little judas , have brought them here ... ... i can only surmise that the fortuneteller has found herself another shell ?
disappointing , but not unexpected .
i do hope , however , she has the good manners to learn her lesson ... ... and to remember that there is no action without consequence .
and if you take something from me , you will pay the price .
you know why we are here ?
come now , what kind of question is this ?
of course i know .
it is my business to know .
some might think this is a strange coincidence , but i do not .
i am curious , though , as to how it actually happened .
do you know ?
no .
no ?
i did not think so .
but it is always best to ask , huh ?
we want to make a deal .
always straight to business , huh , morpheus ?
okay .
i have something you want .
to make a deal ... ... you must have something i want , yes ?
and it so happens there is something i want .
something i have wanted ever since i first came here .
it is said they cannot be taken ... ... they can only be given .
what ?
the eyes of the oracle .
i told you before , there is no escaping the nature of the universe .
it is that nature that has again brought you to me .
where some see coincidence , i see consequence .
where others see chance ... ... i see cost .
bring me the eyes of the oracle ... ... and i will give you back your savior .
it seems a perfectly fair and reasonable deal to me .
yes ?
no ?
i don' t have time for this shit .
you wanna make a deal ?
how about this ?
you give me neo , or we all die , right here , right now .
interesting deal .
you are really ready to die for this man ?
believe it .
she' il do it .
if she has to , she' il kill every one of us .
she' s in love .
it is remarkable how similar the pattern of love is to the pattern of insanity .
time' s up .
what' s it gonna be , merv ?
okay .
you got yourself in here ... ... you can get yourself out .
are you ready for us ?
almost , sir .
they got some pretty ancient hacks here .
but you found neo ?
can' t you see him ?
no , sir .
we read something , but i couldn' t tell what .
i can' t leave yet .
i have to see her .
now ?
it' s my last chance .
that' s it .
that' s the secret .
you' ve got to use your hands .
why ?
cookies need love like everything does .
neo !
i was hoping to have these done before you got here .
oh , well .
sati , honey , i think it' s time for a tasting .
take the bowl to seraph and find out if they' re ready .
okay .
i' m glad you got out .
me too .
so do you recognize me ?
a part of you .
yeah , that' s how it works .
some bits you lose , some bits you keep .
i don' t yet recognize my face in the mirror ... ... but i still love candy .
no , thank you .
remember how you were when you first walked through my door ?
jittery as a june bug .
and now , just look at you .
you sure did surprise me , neo , and you still do .
you gave me a few surprises too .
i hope i helped .
you helped me to get here , but my question is , why ?
where is this going ?
where does it end ?
i don' t know .
you don' t know or you won' t tell me ?
i told you before ... ... no one can see beyond a choice they don' t understand , and i mean no one .
what choice ?
it doesn' t matter .
it' s my choice .
i have mine to make , same as you have yours .
does that include what things to tell me and what not to ?
of course not .
why didn' t you tell me about the architect ?
about zion and the ones before me ?
why didn' t you tell me the truth ?
because it wasn' t time for you to know .
who decided it wasn' t time ?
you know who .
know thyself
i did .
then i think it' s time for me to know a few more things .
so do i.
tell me how i separated my mind from my body without jacking in .
tell me how i stopped four sentinels by thinking it .
tell me just what the hell is happening to me .
the power of the one extends beyond this world .
it reaches from here all the way back to where it came from .
where ?
the source .
that' s what you felt when you touched those sentinels , but you weren' t ready for it .
you should be dead , but apparently you weren' t ready for that either .
the architect said that if i didn' t return to the source , zion would be destroyed tonight .
please .
you and i may not be able to see beyond our own choices ... ... but that man can' t see past any choice .
why not ?
he doesn' t understand them .
he can' t .
to him , they are variables in an equation .
one at a time , each variable must be solved , then countered .
that' s his purpose .
to balance the equation .
what' s your purpose ?
to unbalance it .
why ?
what do you want ?
i want the same thing you want , neo .
and i' m willing to go as far as you are to get it .
the end of the war .
is it going to end ?
one way or another .
can zion be saved ?
i' m sorry , i don' t have the answer to that question , but ....
if there is an answer , there' s only one place you' re going to find it .
where ?
you know where .
and if you can' t find the answer ... ... then i' m afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us .
what does that mean ?
everything that has a beginning ... ... has an end .
i see the end coming .
i see the darkness spreading .
i see death .
and you are all that stands in his way .
smith .
very soon , he is going to have the power to destroy this world .
but i believe he won' t stop there .
he can' t .
he won' t stop until there' s nothing left at all .
what is he ?
he is you .
your opposite , your negative .
the result of the equation trying to balance itself out .
and if i can' t stop him ?
one way or another , neo ... ... this war is going to end .
tonight , the future of both worlds will be in your hands ... ... or in his .
how are you feeling ?
are you all right ?
i need time .
that figures .
captain roland .
what' s up , maggie ?
bane is .
he' s conscious .
good .
maybe he' s got some answers .
i love that smell .
i sure am going to miss it .
oracle .
i know .
i know .
sati , honey .
take a few cookies and go with seraph .
can i come back ?
i would like to come back .
i would like that too .
then i' il see you tomorrow .
i hope so , hon , i hope so .
i' m scared , seraph .
come .
he' s following us .
well , well , it' s been a long time .
i remember chasing you was like chasing a ghost .
i have beaten you before .
yes , true , but as you can see , things are a little different now .
and you must be the last exile .
the oracle told me about you .
really ?
what did she say about me ?
that you were a bad man .
oh , i' m not so bad , once you get to know me .
the great and powerful oracle , we meet at last .
i suppose you' ve been expecting me , right ?
the all knowing oracle is never surprised .
how can she be ?
she knows everything .
but if that' s true , then why is she here if she knew i was coming ?
why wouldn' t she leave ?
maybe you knew i would do that , maybe you didn' t .
if you did , that means you baked those cookies and set that plate there ... ... deliberately , purposefully ... ... which means that you' re sitting there also deliberately , purposefully .
what did you do with sati ?
cookies need love like everything does .
you are a bastard .
you would know , mom .
do what you' re here to do .
yes , ma' am .
i really wish i could help , but i just ....
i don' t remember any of it .
what about the cuts on your arms ?
those cuts are more than one day old .
yeah , definitely .
you' re right about that , sir .
they look like they might be self inflicted .
but why would i do something like that to myself ?
unless , of course , i wasn' t myself .
but if i' m not me , then who am i ?
has this man been tested for vdts ?
yes , sir .
it was negative .
but he is showing a lot of unusual neural activity .
some cross synaptic firing , as well as signs of recent trauma ... ... with fresh fibrotic scarring throughout the cortex .
i want the truth .
i don' t care what it takes .
make him remember .
sir , we found her .
the logos</ i> ?
yes , sir .
about time we had some goddamn good news .
are the thermals picking up any signs of life ?
no , sir .
nothing yet .
what about the ship ?
holographic says the hull' s still intact .
drop down and keep a man in the turret .
yes , sir .
get a full diagnostic on that ship as fast as humanly possible .
careful , sir .
the squids are sneaky bastards .
it could be a trap .
what was that ?
you can put that shit away , boys .
all she needs is a jump .
niobe .
morpheus .
are you all right ?
yes , i' m fine .
we didn' t know what happened after ....
i' m sorry .
it' s okay .
i' m happy to see you too .
did you get neo out ?
yes .
how did you know about that ?
the oracle .
you saw her ?
just before the sentinels found us .
what did she tell you ?
the same thing she always does .
exactly what i needed to hear .
in 12 hours , the machines will breach the dock walls .
every simulation we' ve run , we' ve seen that once the machines are inside the city ... ... the odds of our survival decrease dramatically .
thus , our primary objective must be ... ... to destroy or disable the diggers inside the dock .
if we can do that , perhaps we can prevent them from ever reaching the city .
if not , the only place we will be able to mount a defense ... ... will be at the entrance of the temple .
it is small and will force them into a bottleneck ... ... allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense .
we understand that you' ve requested additional volunteers .
that is correct .
precisely what size force are you planning to commit to the primary dock objective ?
right now , the entire apu corps and half the infantry .
half the infantry ?
lf it were up to me , councillor ... ... i' d take every man , woman and child , put a gun in their hand ... ... and march them into that dock .
perhaps it is best that it is not up to you .
time will tell , councillor .
commander , just one more question .
has there been word from the nebuchadnezzar</ i> ?
none , and at this point there' s no reason to expect there will be .
perhaps .
but we can hope .
i' m afraid hope is an indulgence i don' t have time for .
zee , what are you doing ?
making shells .
they' re evacuating our level .
we have to go .
i' m not going with you .
what ?
they' ve called for volunteers to hold the dock .
kids , you stay here .
i know how you feel , but you can' t do this .
i have to .
why ?
because i love him .
i love him the same as he loves me .
and if i were out there and he were here , i know what he' d do .
but you' re gonna get yourself killed .
it' s crazy , zee .
maybe it is .
but ask yourself , if it were dozer ... ... and you knew the only chance you had to see him was to hold the dock ... ... what would you do ?
make shells .
what the shit is going on over here ?
an accident , sir .
i didn' t see
i' m sorry .
who the hell are you ?
a unit volunteer , sir .
what' s a pod born pencil neck like you doing volunteering for my corps ?
i want to do my part , sir .
we gotta hold the dock .
how old are you , kid ?
eighteen .
should have said 16 , i might have believed that .
okay , i' m 16 .
minimum age for the corps is 18 .
sixteen' s too young .
the machines don' t care how old i am .
they' il kill me just the same .
ain' t that the goddamn truth .
give me a chance , sir .
i won' t let you down .
you do , and you' il find me and the machines have got something in common .
okay , charge the igniter .
she lives again .
you want to reload the operations software , sparky ?
yeah .
could you clean the windshield while you' re at it ?
uplinks in place .
i' m bringing her back online .
looking good , except ....
something' s wrong with the matrix feed .
no , there' s not .
you' re looking at what we' re looking at .
what' s going on in there ? </ i>
whatever it is , it can' t be good .
the machines have taken junction 21 .
the way i see it , if we drop down from broadcast here ... ... intersect 153 , we might surprise them .
we' il go first , hammer as deep as we can , then blow our emp .
hopefully we can punch a hole big enough for you to get through .
it ain' t pretty , but the way i see it , it' s the only way back .
no , it' s not .
there' s another way .
a support line .
it drops down right here , 1000 meters short of 21 .
if we' re lucky , we may be able to slip down without them ever knowing .
that' s a mechanical line .
it' s impossible .
no one can pilot a mechanical .
i can .
bullshit .
i' ve done it .
that was a long time ago , niobe .
i said i can do it .
so what ?
you' il be the only one that can .
there' s no way we can follow you .
hi .
i know time is always against us .
i' m sorry that i took so long .
but i wanted to be sure .
sure of what ?
i know what i have to do .
what ?
there' s no easy way to say this , so i' il just say it .
i have to take one of the ships .
what ?
to go where ?
to the machine city .
i know it' s difficult to understand .
no , it' s not .
you' re out of your goddamn mind .
i still have to go .
in 100 years , no ship has been within 100 kilometers of it .
you' il never make it .
i have to try .
is this what the oracle has told you ?
no .
this is asinine .
if you want to kill yourself , do it ... ... but do it without wasting our ships .
you have to believe me .
i have to go .
bullshit !
i am the captain of this ship .
i say where it has to go !
and this ship will go to hell long before i let you take it anywhere .
he can take mine .
you can' t do that .
don' t try to tell me what i can or cannot do ... ... with my ship after that little speech .
but for chrissake , niobe  i' il pilot this ship , he can take mine .
if we leave inside the hour , we should reach zion as the machines do .
that' s as good a plan as any .
it' s a waste .
a goddamn waste .
two ships , two directions .
sounds like providence , doesn' t it , morpheus ?
you' ve never believed in the one .
i still don' t .
then why are you doing this ?
i believe in him .
thank you .
what' s that for ?
to help you relax .
to make it easier for you to remember .
what if i don' t want to remember ?
why would you want that ?
what if i blew that emp ?
what if i did destroy those ships ... ... and i am responsible for the deaths of all those men ?
if i did that ... ... it wouldn' t be very safe for me here , would it ?
of course , it might not be very safe for you either .
i' m ready .
trinity ... ... there' s something i have to say .
something you need to understand .
i know i' m supposed to go .
but beyond that ... ... i don' t know .
i ....
i know .
you don' t think you' re coming back .
i knew it the moment you said you had to leave .
i could see it in your face .
just like you knew the moment you looked at me that i was coming with you .
i' m scared , trin .
so am i.
it took me 10 minutes to buckle up one boot .
but i' il tell you something .
six hours ago , i told the merovingian ... ... i was ready to give anything and everything for you .
do you know what' s changed in the last six hours ?
no .
nothing .
finished loading ammunition ? </ i>
just about .
let' s move it .
we are out of time .
you' re not leaving them anything ?
he said he didn' t need it .
i ain' t saying goodbye .
i' m saying good luck .
thank you .
i can only hope you know what you' re doing .
me too .
it was an honor , sir .
no , the honor is still mine .
we' re read , sir . </ i>
about damn time .
we' re already late , captain , so let' s hit it and hit it hard .
bye , baby .
take good care of them .
ready ?
engine' s still firing .
must be a fuse .
i' il check it out .
i should' ve known he' d send his bitch first .
bane .
no one ever got away from me as many times as you did .
every time , i thought it was the last .
every time , i was sure we had you , but you' d slip through our fingers .
i really can' t express just how aggravating that can be .
what are you talking about ?
i think i might enjoy killing you as much as killing him .
neo , it' s bane .
he' s psychotic !
you' re gonna pay for that .
twenty seven kilometers to go .
we got an emergenc . </ i>
what is it , ak ?
it' s maggie , sir . </ i>
she' s dead , murdered . </ i>
i think it was bane . </ i>
goddamn it .
i knew it .
i knew he was out of his goddamn mind .
he fired that emp .
goddamn it , i should have beaten it out of him .
we searched the whole ship , captain .
he ain' t here .
i know where he is .
the logos</ i> .
we gotta go back .
too late .
what if they need our help ?
it' s too dangerous .
why ?
because if he' s killed them ... ... he' il control another emp .
at this point , they' re on their own .
just like us .
mr. anderson .
i see you are as predictable in this world as you are in the other .
what ?
he' s out of his mind .
it might appear that way .
but mr. anderson and i know ... ... that appearances can be deceiving .
confused , mr. anderson ?
it' il all become clear in a moment .
thank you for bringing me the gun .
you can set it down there .
don' t do it .
shoot .
shoot now .
yes , shoot .
fry us .
burn us alive .
do it .
if you don' t , he' il kill us both .
look at him .
he knows he should do it , but he won' t .
he can' t .
do it .
back away from the gun and turn around .
let her go .
somehow familiar , isn' t it ?
we' ve been here before , you and i , remember ?
i do .
i think of nothing else .
who are you ?
still don' t recognize me ?
i admit , it is difficult to even think encased in this rotting piece of meat .
the stink of it filling every breath , a suffocating cloud you can' t escape .
disgusting .
look at how pathetically fragile it is .
nothing this weak is meant to survive .
what do you want ?
i want what you want .
yes .
