love mom & dad
i know it' s been hard for you because of the accident .
i' m almost a father to you .
think about it once more .
you shouldn' t do this however little hope there is .
soo hyun needs to prepare herself too .
it won' t be possible to keep her from finding out .
arguing with you is no use ...
the prescription' s for a week .
if anything happens come in at once .
what is this ?
soo hyun , congratulations on your discharge !
a wig ?
let' s go , quick .
let' s get the hell out of this damned hospital .
either to die slowly like me ... ... or to speed along and go with a bang ...
which would be better ?
at least there' d be no sense of terror ...
better to go with a bang , right ?
ji hyun .
have i really been cured ?
good ...
that' s really great .
i' m sorry i didn' t realize you' d come .
how is the work going ?
it' s almost finished .

even i feel frustrated .
soo hyun is soo hyun and you are you .
you' ve done enough .
ma' am , please look at this dress .
you don' t mind if i wear your clothes ?
do you happen to remember this ?
when we went to the amusement park as kids ,
dad took pictures with this .
ji hyun , let' s go out .
there' s something i want to do .
no , i' m right ...
look at that !
would you take our picture ?
thanks .
hurry !
actually ,
i didn' t believe you .
but it seems like i' ve really been cured .
after being out all day i' m still full of energy .
i almost doubt i' ve ever been sick .
it' s like ...
i' ve been born again .
ji hyun , did you see that ?
that bus , just now ... ?
like you said ,
i must have been mistaken , right ?
take off the wig .
i like it this way .
congratulations , ji hyun !
whoever the model is she' s really mysterious .

we' re getting married soon .
how can you do this to me ?
do you know how long i waited ?
what about love ?
love is what ?

i' il leave only good memories and then go .
oh , you' re back .
where have you been ?
what do you think ?

ji hyun , give me your wallet .
i' m sick of this face .
it' s a present .

he wants a divorce .

what will i do ?
without him ,
i' m dead .
kyung joo' s here !
yeah , i heard you were discharged .
but how' d you get so pretty ?
did you get plastic surgery ?
ji hyun , how do i look ?
doesn' t this wig look great on me ?
soo hyun' s in the shower .
ji hyun ...
i think i know how to get him back .
where is my hair ?
my hair !
ji hyun
soo hyun is looking for her wig please bring it to her .
ji hyun ...
i turned it on to wake you up .
immediate results !
isn' t kyung joo a strange one ?
but just leaving it at the crack of dawn ?
chief detective' s office
the phone records show you' re the last person she called .
when did you meet her ?
you may not believe it but it' s lee kyung joo .
look closely .
they say her husband had a lover and asked for a divorce .
better to die together than to get divorced ...
she looked ten years older .
there must have been someone else there .
my sister' s not that kind of person .
teacher , dance with me .
hurry .
look at your face ...
did my dancing shock you ?
let' s go now .
what ?
if you' re going to speak do it right .
ki seok is so hot !
soo hyun ...
i' m so scared , ji hyun .
kyung joo died .
in there ...
kyung joo died .
there' s been no deterioration at all .
as if her body is taking cues from her mind ,
soo hyun' s belief that she is cured ... seems to be exerting a strong placebo effect .
then what about her hallucinations ?
it doesn' t happen to everyone but it is possible .
the pain killer given to terminal cancer patients contains a certain amount of narcotics .
i worried about the change in her face , but the tests imply she' s holding up well .
it' s a relief ...
there may be hope for her .
why don' t you go home and take a rest ?
it seems that you didn' t sleep well for several days .
we' ve already broken up .
i want you to stop using her as an excuse to obsess over me .
i know you' re scared that when she leaves , you' il be left alone .
but there' s absolutely nothing i can do for you .
they' ve grown bigger .
it' s me .
soo hyun' s here .
she stopped in to avoid the rain .
don' t worry and wait at home .
i' il drive her back once she warms up .
ki seok ...
ki seok ...
ki seok ...
don' t do this , soo hyun .
i am dying .
you know that .
soo hyun .
ki seok ...
i want to have you one last time .
you shouldn' t do this .
you wanted me , too .
i never wanted you .
i love you , teacher .
i really love you , teacher .
i love you , teacher .
i love you , teacher .
i' m not your teacher .
you bitch .
even after getting rejected like that you still don' t have a clue .
what' s wrong ?
ji hyun ...
you look like you' re going to kill me .
ji hyun , what' s wrong ?
ji hyun , what' s wrong ?
are you crazy ?
hey !
give it back !
ji hyun !
ji hyun , you bought me that wig .
give me back my hair !
give me back my hair
this wig is cursed .
we should destroy it .
ji hyun ... give me my hair !
give me my hair , ji hyun !
no !
don' t do it ...
no !
don' t ...
who are you to erase my memories ?
no !
don' t ...
don' t do it !
don' t ...
don' t ...
no ... no ...
she' s improved greatly since her last visit .
in other tests as well absolutely no symptoms of leukemia were found .
but this is a bit strange .
there' s always a slight difference between actual age and physical age .
but in soo hyun' s case , her bone density has dropped alarmingly over the past few days .
what does that mean ?
soo hyun is currently aging very quickly .
it' s because of the wig .
there' s a ghost in the wig .
is there anything else ?
in cases like this , it' s harder for the people watching over her .
did soo hyun say anything ... ?
it might be better to keep soo hyun in the hospital a while .
she is absolutely refusing to see ji hyun .
teacher .
did i ... happen to leave my camera in your studio ?
yes , you did .
there' s some film inside it .
i' d like to see those pictures .
okay , i' il develop them for you .
right now ...
quickly .
snap out of it , and look at me .
the police are searching so they' il find her soon .
she' s not at home so she must be in the hospital .
i' il look for her , so wait here .
they say hair lives off people' s memories ...
the old woman kept saying that she could see something .
it' s called " jang " .
the factory that supplied her with wigs .
people say they used dead people' s hair to make wigs .
they took hair from someone who committed suicide .
rumors say the factory owner died while making a wig out of it .
he had a daughter , but no one knows what happened to her .
assorted wigs " jang
soo hyun ...
soo hyun ...
i' m scared ...
i' m scared ...
i' m so scared ...
this hair is alive .
we should never have made that wig .
is this from a dead body ?
that night ,
he ... he ... died ...
i liked him so much .
that hee ju , i liked him so much .
the two of them loved each other .
two men ...
she' s really mysterious looking ...
who is it ?
no one special .
there' s no other dress in the world like this one .
thank you .
but did you get plastic surgery ?
i worried about the change in her face ...
soo hyun' s changed a lot .
teacher .
it' s me , hee ju .
soo hyun ...
i' m hee ju , not soo hyun .
feel me .
i' m not a man anymore .
you' re not hee ju .
hee ju' s dead .
i' m alive right now .
i' ve waited so long for this moment .
i so wanted to reveal myself to you ...
hee ju , it' s no use .
let soo hyun go that body isn' t yours .
you liked me .
you loved me !
i loved you ...
but ...
love is for one person only !
and it never wavers .
i love you , teacher .
get away from him !
you want to speak in a pretty voice .
you want to say i love you .
hee ju , no ...
you bitch !
ji hyun ...
do you know what love is ?
it' s remembering ...
my hair ... !
my hair !
my hair ... !
no , no , no !
my hair ... !

no ...
no , no , no !
no ...
no , no , no !
no ...
no , no !
no ...
no , no !
no , no !
no ...
it' s all over now .
it' s all over .
ji hyun ...
my hair keeps growing ...
ji hyun ...
what' s wrong ?
i' m soo hyun .
no ...
you' re not soo hyun .
i' m scared , ji hyun ...
ji hyun , i' m sick ...
i need my medicine ...
ji hyun ...
at the amusement park ...
do you remember the balloons
dad bought us ?
as we fought over the prettier color ,
the balloon flew up to the sky .
i cried , and so did you ...
so you told me ...
later , when i' m grown up , you' d put wings on me .
so i could go to the sky ...
and find the balloon .
ji hyun ...
thank you for the wings .
ji hyun ?
listen closely .
soo hyun wasn' t taking her pills .
probably she did it for your sake , so she could look healthier .
the pills are strong , so if you stop taking them for a short time you look healthy .
her hair may have grown back too .
it was looking hopeful ...
if she stops taking the pills the cancer can return .
so bring soo hyun back to the hospital right away , understand ?
