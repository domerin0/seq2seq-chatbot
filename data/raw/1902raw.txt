sky surfing is when you skydive , with a board attached to your feet , and try to do different maneuvers .
a camera flyer flies with a camera on top of a helmet , filming the sky surfer ... and flies with the sky surfer for capturing the moves .

i' m gonna put these on nice and loose .
everything' s gonna be okay , right ?
