i' il give you passage home on my ship ... and you can help me recover my treasure .
oh , don' t you see ?
the treasure' s useless to peter .
he' s not sensible like you and i.
he' s just a boy who' il never grow up .
hmm .
tell me about it .
hook : and , really , what other choice do you have ?
it' s not as though you could fly home .
hmm , well , i suppose .
if it is rightfully yours .
and if it' s really no use to peter ...
splendid , splendid !
wait !
hmm ?
you must swear not to harm peter .
me ?
actually harm peter pan ?
perish the thought .
i shan' t harm him .
you have my word .
i , captain james hook ...
do hereby swear ...
not to harm a single hair on peter pan' s head .
hook : y : ou see ?
leave the light on , mommy ... your baby boy' s coming home .

do you believe in magic
in a young girl' s heart
how the music can free her
whenever it starts
and it' s magic
if the music can move you
and hold you so tight
that it never can lose you
y : our feet start tappin '
and you can' t seem to find
if it' s really real
or just a state of mind
if you believe in magic
just close those big eyes
and think all the wonderful thoughts that arise
and maybe
if you dream it just right
y : our toes will be over the treetops tonight
and you' il be flyln '
and from there you can see
how the magic' s in you
that the magic' s in me
if you believe in magic
come along with me
we' il dance until morning
till it' s just you and me
and maybe
if the music is right
i' il meet you tomorrow so late at night
and we' il go dancln ' , baby , then you' il see
how the magic' s in music
and the music' s in me
believe in the magic of a young glrl' s soul
believe in the magic of rock and roll
believe in the magic that can set you free

i am not a child now
i can take care of myself
i mustn' t let them down , now
mustn' t let them see me cry
i' m fine
i' m fine
i' m too tired to listen
i' m too old to believe
all these childish stories
there is no such thing as faith
and trust
and pixie dust
i try
but it' s so hard to believe
i try
but i can' t see what you see
i try
i try
i try
my whole world is changing
i don' t know where to turn
i can' t leave you waiting
but i can' t stay and watch the city burn
mmm , watch it burn
' cause i try
but it' s so hard to believe
i try
but i can' t see what you see
i try
i try
i try and try to understand
the distance in between
the love i feel and the things i fear
and every single dream
i can finally see it
now i have to believe
all those precious stories
all the world is made of faith
and trust
and pixie dust
so i' il try
' cause i finally believe
i' il try
' cause i can see what you see
i' il try
i' il try
i will try
i' il try
to fly
