mr. frank .
mr. frank ?
kraler .
mr. kraler .
miep .
my good friends .
it is so good to see you home .
we had heard nothing .
i' m alone .
you must come home with us ... ... and rest now .
you must stay with us .
no , i can' t stay in amsterdam .
mr. frank , this is your home .
amsterdam is your home .
it has too many memories .
everywhere there' s something , miep .
everywhere .
even seeing you and mr. kraler ....
i shouldn' t talk to you like this , after all you did .
why , we' d do it again .
everything' s gone .
the book ....
they took everything , except some papers .
we saved your letters and papers .
please burn them .
burn everything .
i told her ... ... if i got back here , i' d find her book .
anne' s diary ?
it' s where she left it .
the 9th of july , 1 942 . " 1 942 .
is it possible , miep ?
only three years ago ?
dear diary , since you and i are to be great friends ... ... i will start by telling you all about myself .
my name is anne frank .
i am 1 3 years old .
i was born in germany , but since my family is jewish ... ... we emigrated to holland when hitler came to power .
things went well for us until the war came and the german occupation .
then things got very bad for the jews .
you could not do this and you could not do that .
we had to wear yellow stars .
i had to turn in my bike .
i couldn ' t go to a dutch school anymore .
i couldn ' t go to the movies or ride in an automobile ... ... or even on a streetcar .
and a million other things .
but somehow , we children still managed to have fun .
this morning , father woke me at 5 : 00 ... ... and told me to hurry and get dressed .
we were going into hiding .
i was to put on as many clothes as i could .
it would look too suspicious if we walked along carrying suitcases .
we were going to disappear ... ... vanish into thin air .
i' m living a great adventure .
three other people were coming in with us .
father knew them .
we had never met them .
something' s happened .
they had a 3 mile walk .
mother .
they' ve been arrested , i know .
will you stop that ?
mother .
father .
we' re here .
you see ?
mr. van daan .
hello .
mrs. van daan .
mr. frank .
peter .
there were too many green police on the streets .
we took the long way around .
did you introduce yourself ?
my daughter anne .
my wife , edith .
margot .
mr. and mrs. van daan .
oh , and this is our son , peter .
so , now , please let us take off some of these clothes .
good morning .
good morning , mr. kraler .
morning , mr. kraler .
mr. frank .
you' re all here .
that is good .
we hoped to have everything in order .
please , don' t even think of it .
we' il have leisure to arrange everything ourselves .
brought sandwiches for lunch .
thank you , miep .
the canned goods are here , and your beans and potatoes .
i' il get you ration books this afternoon .
ration books ?
if they see our names on ration books , they' il know we' re here .
don' t worry .
it won' t be your names that' il be on them .
father !
the westertoren !
anne !
no !
you must never touch a curtain .
never .
no one must ever touch a curtain , day or night .
if someone on the streets should look up or someone should see ... ... we would be lost .
remember , it' s not only our lives at stake ... ... but miep' s and mr. kraler' s .
you have 1 3 minutes to get settled .
thank you .
miep or i will be up each day to bring you food and news .
come , miep , we must go .
goodbye .
goodbye , mr. kraler .
how can we thank you ?
i never thought i' d live to see the day when a man like mr. frank ... ... would have to go into hiding .
when you think of it ....
goodbye .
thank you , mr. kraler .
goodbye .
anne !
it' s all right , i have on three more .
excuse me , mr. frank .
what do they mean , " 1 3 minutes " ?
before workmen come .
now ... ... while the men are in the building below , we must be quiet .
every sound can be heard down there , in the offices and in the workrooms too .
the men come at about 8 : 30 .
they leave at about 5 : 30 .
so to be perfectly safe , from 8 a . m . until 6 p . m ... ... we must move about up here only when absolutely necessary ... ... and then in stockinged feet .
we must not speak above a whisper or run any water .
we cannot use the sink or even , forgive me , the w. c.
the pipes go down through the workrooms .
no trash must ever be
no trash , which might reveal someone' s living here .
not even a potato peeling .
we must burn everything in the stove at night .
this is the way that we must live until it is over , if we are to survive .
until it is over .
after 6 : 00 , we can move about .
we can talk and laugh ... ... have our supper , read , play games , just as we would at home .
now it would be wise if we all went to our rooms ... ... and were settled before 8 : 00 .
mr. and mrs. van daan , you' re upstairs .
i regret there' s no place up there for peter .
but he' il be here , near us .
and where am l ?
you and margot will be in there .
excuse me , mr. frank .
yes ?
where do you sleep ?
this room is our bedroom .
oh , no , no .
you take the upstairs .
we' il sleep down here .
i' ve thought this out .
it' s the best arrangement .
the only arrangement .
edith ?
you must have some rest , dear .
you didn' t close your eyes last night .
now , go in the girls ' room .
well , how about anne ?
i feel fine .
i' m going to help father .
this way , mrs. van daan .
excuse me .
up here .
mr. frank ?
mr. frank ?
peter ?
i have time to get water for my cat ?
you' ve a cat ?
go ahead , but be quick .
you only have about five minutes .
he couldn' t live without that cat .
i didn' t know you had a cat .
i love cats .
what' s its name ?
mouschi .
what is it ?
mouschi .
a him or her ?
it' s a tom .
it doesn' t like strangers .
then i' il have to stop being a stranger .
ls he fixed ?
no .
you ought to have him fixed , to keep him from fighting .
what a nice cat .
where do you go to school ?
jewish secondary .
that' s where margot and i go .
yeah , i know .
i' ve never seen you around .
i used to see you sometimes .
you did ?
why didn' t you ever come over ?
oh , i don' t know .
i' m sort of a lone wolf .
you can' t be a lone wolf here .
i wonder what our friends will say when we don' t show up today .
i had a date with sanne .
do you know sanne de vries ?
no .
sanne' s my best friend .
she' s thin like me .
anne and sanne , the skinny bananas .
you took off your star .
that' s right .
you can' t do that .
they' il arrest you if you go out without your star .
who' s going out ?
help me .
i' m helping .
what are you going to do with it ?
burn it .
it' s funny , i don' t think i could burn mine .
i don' t know why .
you couldn' t ?
something they make you wear so they can kick you around .
i know .
but after all ... ... it is the star of david , isn' t it ?
annele , it' s almost 8 : 00 .
don' t you wanna sit with us ?
it' il be a long day .
no , thanks .
this is fine .
you won' t forget to take off your shoes , will you ?
peter ... ... it' s nice to have you with us .
yes , mr. frank .
see you later .
did you know that he went to the same school that ?
it' s comforting that mr. kraler and his secretary ... ... are down there below us , in the office .
our protectors , we call them .
i asked father what would happen to them ... ... if anyone found out they were hiding us .
father said they would suffer the same fate that we would .
we are over an old spice factory .
you can smell the spices all through the building .
i read a tale of two cities through in that first day .
it is a far , far better thing i do ... ... than i have ever done .
it is a far , far better rest that i go to ... ... than i have ever known .
the end .
it was the saddest book i ever read .
it is us , miep and kraler .
good evening , mr. kraler .
good evening , miep .
good evening , annele .
oh , mr. frank .
yes ?
this is the box you asked for .
thanks .
oh , my dear friends , you were all so quiet up here .
i thought you' d gone out for a walk .
can you imagine me ?
i didn' t talk .
i hardly moved for one whole day .
wish they could hear that at school .
mouschi !
mouschi !
peter !
peter .
mouschi .
annele !
annie !
annele !
peter , i' m warning you .
please , quiet .
margot .
margot !
what are these ?
you don' t have to whisper now .
there you are .
he' s such a nice cat .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
annele .
there' s a box there .
will you open it , please ?
know how i' m going to think of it here ?
as a boarding house , a very peculiar boarding house .
father , my film stars !
i was wondering where they were .
and queen wilhelmina .
how wonderful .
there' s something more .
go on , look further .
a diary .
i' ve never had a diary .
and i' ve always wanted one .
a pencil ?
i' m going downstairs to get a pencil .
anne , no !
there' s nobody down there .
doesn' t matter .
don' t go beyond that door .
never ?
never .
i' m sorry , anne , it isn' t safe .
i see .
it' il be hard , i know that .
but always remember there are no walls , no locks ... ... no bolts that anyone can put on your mind .
as a matter of fact , just between us , annele ... ... being here has certain advantages .
for instance ... ... remember that battle with your mother about overshoes ?
you said you' d rather die than wear overshoes .
remember ?
what happened ?
in the end , you had to wear them .
now , for as long as we are here , you won' t have to wear overshoes .
isn' t that good ?
and the piano .
you won' t have to practice it .
i tell you ... ... this is going to be a fine life for you .
it' s an odd idea for someone like me to keep a diary .
not only because i have never done so before ... ... but because it seems to me , neither i , nor for that matter anyone else ... ... will be interested in the unbosomings of a 13 year old schoolgirl .
still , what does that matter ?
i want to write , but more than that ... ... i want to bring out all kinds of things ... ... that lie buried deep in my heart .
first of all , i expect i should be describing ... ... what it' s like to go into hiding .
but i don ' t really know yet myself .
i only know it' s funny never to be able to go outdoors .
never to breathe fresh air .
never to run and shout and jump .
wednesday , the 23rd of september , 1942 .
the news of the war is good .
stalingrad is still holding out .
the russian offensive continues in the moscow area .
it' s safe now .
the last workman has left .
whee !
anne !
l ' m first for the w. c.
six o' clock , margot .
school is over .
where are my shoes ?
have you seen my shoes ?
what shoes ?
you' re gonna be sorry .
i am ?
annie , dear .
wait till i get you .
i' m waiting .
stop !
peter !
annie !
peter !
peter , where are you going ?
gonna give mouschi his dinner .
peter !
annie , dear ... ... you shouldn' t play like that with pete .
that' s not dignified .
who wants to be dignified ?
i don' t wanna be dignified !
you complain i don' t treat you like a grownup , but when i do , you resent it .
i only want some fun .
i don' t know what' s the matter with that boy .
give him a little time .
he isn' t used to girls .
time ?
isn' t two months time ?
i could cry .
and what about miep ?
she' s usually so prompt .
margot , come and dance with me .
i' ve got more work to do , anne .
you know , we' re going to forget how to dance .
when we get out , we won' t remember a thing .
where is peter ?
where would he be ?
with his cat .
he hasn' t finished his lessons , has he ?
peter .
peter !
what is it ?
your mother says to come out .
i' m giving mouschi his dinner .
you know what your father says about wasting time with that cat .
i haven' t looked at him since lunch .
i' m only telling you .
i' il feed him .
you stay out of here .
and i mean out .
is that any way for you to talk to your little girlfriend ?
mother , i asked you ...
... would you please not say that ?
look , he' s blushing .
he' s blushing .
please , i' m not , but
leave me alone .
like it' s something to be ashamed of .
nothing to be ashamed of to have a girlfriend .
that' s crazy .
she' s only 1 3 .
so what ?
you' re 1 6 .
it' s just perfect .
your father' s 1 0 years older than me .
mr. frank , i warn you ... ... if this war lasts much longer , we' re gonna be related .
mazel tov .
i haven' t seen my cat since lunch .
i' m giving mouschi his dinner .
my little mouschi .
i couldn' t live without my precious mouschi .
you wonderful cat , you .
all right , miss quack quack .
what' s that ?
miss quack quack !
you !
you talk so much they call you miss quack quack .
you' re the most intolerable boy i ever met !
quack , quack , quack !
quack !
ooh !
anne , dear , you' re hot .
you' re warm .
are you all right ?
mother , please .
you don' t have a fever , do you ?
no .
you know we can' t call a doctor here , ever .
there' s only one thing to do , watch carefully .
prevent an illness before it comes .
let me see your tongue .
mother , this is perfectly absurd .
anne , dear , don' t be such a baby .
let me see your tongue .
otto .
anne , you hear your mother , don' t you ?
come on , open up .
quack .
annie .
otto .
anne .
you' re all right .
i think there' s nothing the matter with our anne that a ride on her bike ... ... or a visit with her friend sanne de vries wouldn' t cure .
isn' t that so , anne ?
i keep wishing that peter was a girl instead of a boy .
then i' d have someone to talk to .
with all the boys in the world ... ... why did i have to get locked up with him ?
is it someone ?
ls it miep ?
it' s strange we don' t hear .
maybe she got hurt .
she' il come .
i wish she' d get here .
i' m going crazy without cigarettes .
anne , you got " excellent " in your history paper ...
... and " very good " in latin .
yes , but how about algebra ?
well , i have a confession to make .
up until now , i managed to stay ahead of you in algebra .
today , you caught up with me .
we' il leave it to margot to correct .
lsn' t algebra vile , father ?
vile .
how did i do ?
excellent , of course .
anne , please .
your french composition today , margot , was just wonderful .
mrs. van daan , may i try it on ?
no , annie .
it' s all right , really .
but please be careful with it .
my father gave me this coat the year before he died .
he always bought me the best money could buy .
mrs. van daan , did you have a lot of boyfriends before you were married ?
annie , that' s a personal question .
it' s not courteous to ask personal questions .
i don' t mind .
anneke , our house was always swarming with boys .
when i was a young girl  oh , no , not again .
shut up !
one summer , we had a big house in hilversum .
the boys ....
the boys would come buzzing around like bees around a jam pot .
when i was 1 7 ....
well , we were wearing short skirts then , and i had such good looking legs .
i still have .
i may not be as pretty as i used to be ... ... but i still have my legs .
how about it , mr. frank ?
all right , all right .
we see them .
i' m not asking you , i' m asking mr. frank .
mother , for heaven sakes .
oh , i embarrass you too , do l ?
let me tell you something .
i only hope the girl you marry has as good .
anneke , my father used to worry with all the boys hanging around .
' remember , mr. so and so , remember , i am a lady . '
look at you , talking that way with her .
don' t you know she puts it in her diary ?
so what if she does ?
i' m only telling the truth .
haven' t you finished ?
no .
oh , the thinker .
leave him alone .
i' m a dunce .
a hopeless case .
don' t talk like that .
it' s just you haven' t got anyone to help you ... ... iike father helps anne and me .
but if l well , if we could help ....
what about it , peter ?
would you like to study with us ?
shall we make our school coeducational ?
thanks , yes .
mr. frank .
yes ?
you are an angel , an absolute angel .
why didn' t i meet you before i met that one there ?
i think it might be better if you went into your room , peter , to work .
excuse me .
peter , you listen to mr. frank .
mr. frank is a highly educated man .
it' s after 8 : 00 .
where are they ?
at least one of them should' ve come .
they' il come .
don' t worry .
don' t tell me .
i know something' s wrong .
isn' t it bad enough here without you sprawling all over ?
if you didn' t smoke , you wouldn' t be so irritable .
am i smoking ?
you already smoked all the cigarettes .
miep only brought me one package .
it' s a filthy habit ...
... and this is a good time to break it .
oh , stop it .
please .
you' re smoking up all our money .
will you shut up ? !
and what are you staring at ?
i never heard grownups quarrel like that before .
i thought only children quarreled .
this isn' t a quarrel , it' s a discussion .
i never heard children so rude before .
i , rude ?
yes !
annie , drink your milk .
you' ve been spoiled .
what you need is a good spanking .
remember , mr. so and so , i am a lady .
you' re the most aggravating why aren' t you nice and quiet ... ... iike your sister , margot ?
why do you show off all the time ?
let me give you a little advice .
men don' t like that in a girl .
do you know that ?
a man likes a girl who' il listen to him .
a girl who cooks and sews and cleans .
i' d cut my throat first .
i' d open my veins .
i am going to be remarkable .
i' m going to paris ...
... to study music and art .
yeah , yeah .
i' m going to be an actress or a writer or a dancer .
look what you did .
i' m sorry .
you clumsy little fool !
my father gave me this coat !
i' m so sorry .
all ruined , and what do you care ?
you ruined it !
i could kill you !
i could just kill you !
petronella .
petronella , it' s only a coat .
only a coat .
anne , you must not behave in that way .
it was an accident .
anyone can have an accident .
i don' t mean that .
i mean the answering back .
you must not answer back .
they' re our guests .
you don' t hear margot getting into arguments with them .
try to be like margot .
and have them walk all over me the way they do her ?
no , thanks .
i don' t know what happens to you , annie .
if i had ever talked to my mother as you talk to me ....
things have changed , mother .
people aren' t like that anymore .
yes , mother .
no , mother .
anything you say , mother .
i' ve got to fight things out for myself .
make something of myself .
it isn' t necessary to fight to do it .
margot doesn' t
margot . " that' s all i hear .
why aren' t you like margot ?
everything she does is right , and everything i do is wrong .
you' re all against me , and you worst of all .
i don' t know how we can go on living this way .
i can' t say a word to annie , she flies at me .
you know anne .
in a half an hour , she' il be laughing and joking .
and them .
i told your father it wouldn' t work with two families .
but no , no , he had to ask them .
shh .
every time i hear that sound , my heart stops .
it' s miep .
father .
yes ?
it' s miep .
here' s your list .
thank you .
is it miep ?
yes .
at last , i' il have some cigarettes .
miep' s here .
i can' t tell you how sorry i am about the coat .
don' t worry .
hello .
miep .
mr. kraler .
when mr. kraler comes , the sun begins to shine .
dirk has had to leave .
dirk is miep' s fianc .
he had to go into hiding in the country to escape a labor call up ... ... but he has let me have the radio for you .
he shouldn' t have .
it was too dangerous .
look !
our blessed radio .
it gives us our eyes and ears out into the world .
we listen to the german station only for good music .
the axis forces in the western ....
and we listen to the bbc for hope .
man on radlo : ceaseless attacks by land and air forces are now in full retreat .
the 8th army continues to advance .
it' s good .
all right , peter .
now , let' s see what they have to say about the nazis , huh ?
berlin .
must we listen ?
all right , peter , that' s enough .
the green police , they' ve found us .
hmm .
hm .
hm ?
hm .
this way , mr. dussel .
it' s kraler .
and miep .
please open .
bless them .
they' re here .
kraler ?
and miep , yes .
open , please .
well , we had a visitor last night .
we had a visitor last night .
y es , yes .
a thief .
it was a thief ?
did you hear him ?
yes .
he was right under you .
in the office right under here .
we did not know .
we thought it was the police .
are you sure , miep ?
you were , of course , quiet ?
we didn' t move .
we hardly breathed all night .
that is good .
it was close .
too close .
he went through everything , the desk and the files .
and he found the safe , but he could not get it open .
he' s looking for our ration card supply from the underground .
somebody knows .
they are in that safe .
they' il come back .
you should get rid of that safe .
get it out of here .
burglars do not come back .
the safe is gone .
jokes , yeah .
mr. frank , i must talk to you .
of course .
maybe we should get rid of the radio .
put it in the stove .
burn it .
if the green police found that radio ....
then they' d find her diary .
we' il burn that too .
not my diary .
my diary goes , i go with it .
where is it ?
mr. van daan .
if they find us , they might as well find the diary , the radio ....
usually , i try to bring good news .
yes , i know .
but something has happened .
a man came to me .
he told me that he has a jewish friend , a dentist .
he begged me , could i find him a hiding place ?
so i have come to you .
it is a terrible thing to ask of you , living the way you are ...
... but could you take him in ?
well , of course we will .
his name is jan dussel .
dussel .
i think i know him .
i think it' s fine to have him .
thank you .
but , otto , where are we going to put him ?
where ?
there' s so little food as it is  we can stretch the food a little .
he can have my bed .
no , thank you .
margot will move in with us , and he can have her bed .
i' il get my things out .
mr. dussel .
don' t bump your head .
come in , mr. dussel .
this is mr. frank .
mr. otto frank ?
yes .
let me have your things , please .
thank you , mr. frank .
i leave you in good hands .
mr. dussel , i must return your coat .
what can i say to thank you ?
mr. kraler and miep ... ... they' re our lifeline .
without them , we couldn' t live .
please .
you make us seem very heroic .
it isn' t that at all .
we simply don' t like the nazis .
i know , i know .
nobody' s going to tell us dutchmen what to do with our damn jews .
we' il be up tomorrow , see if they' re treating you right .
goodbye .
goodbye , mr. kraler .
goodbye , mr. dussel .
goodbye , miep .
welcome , mr. dussel .
thank you .
this is my wife , edith .
mr. and mrs. van daan .
their son , peter .
my daughters , margot and anne .
hello , anne .
how do you do ?
margot .
how do you do ?
please , mr. dussel , sit down .
thank you .
i' m dreaming , i know it .
mr. otto frank here .
you' re not in switzerland , then ?
someone said that you had escaped .
and you' ve been here all this time ?
ever since july .
did mr. kraler warn you you won' t get much to eat here ?
you can imagine .
three ration cards among the seven of us .
now you make eight .
mr. van daan , you don' t realize what' s happening outside ... ... that you should warn me of a thing like that .
you don' t realize what' s going on , right here in amsterdam .
every day , hundreds of jews disappear .
they surround the block .
they search house by house .
every day , children come home from school to find their parents gone .
hundreds are being deported .
people that you and i know : the hallensteins , the wessels .
oh , no .
come to the station on such and such a day and hour .
bring only what you can carry .
if you don' t , they come drag you from your home ... ... and ship you off to mauthausen , the death camp .
we didn' t know that things had got so much worse .
forgive me for speaking so .
do you know the de vries ?
they' re gone .
sanne and i are in the same class .
sanne is my best my best friend .
she returned home from school to find her parents gone .
she was alone for two days , and then they came and took her away .
gone ?
yes , with all the others .
oh , no .
people named meyerberg , they lived near us .
do you know ?
we should put this off .
i' m sure mr. dussel would like to get settled .
would you take mr. dussel to his room now ?
if you' il come with me , mr. dussel .
forgive me if i haven' t expressed my gratitude .
this has been such a shock to me .
i always thought of myself as dutch .
i was born in holland .
my father was born in holland , and my grandfather .
and now , after all these years ....
if you will excuse me .
it' s so different from what mr. kraler tells us .
mr. kraler says that things are improving .
i like it better the way kraler tells it .
good night .
say good night !
good night , mother .
good night , mr. frank .
good night .
do you have any children , mr. dussel ?
no , i never married .
have you no family at all ?
no one .
how dreadful .
you must be terribly lonely .
i' m used to it .
i don' t think i could ever get used to it .
didn' t you even have a pet ?
a cat or a dog ?
no .
no , no , i have an allergy to furbearing animals .
gives me asthma .
oh , dear .
what ?
peter has a cat .
he has ?
he has it here ?
yes .
we hardly ever see it .
he keeps it in his room all the time .
yeah .
i' m sure it' il be all right .
well , i hope so .
yes .
i hope i won' t be too much of a bother to you , mr. dussel .
no .
i seem to be able to get everyone' s back up .
oh , i always get along very well with young people .
my patients all bring their children to me ... ... because they know i get along well with them .
so don' t you worry about that .
thank you , mr. dussel .
good night .
i' il be back .
good night , mr. dussel .
be careful .
sanne .
sanne ?
sanne !
save me !
save me !
no , no !
no !
don' t take me !
stop it !
stop it !
save me .
hush , annie , hush .
it' s all right .
it' s all right .
please , mr. dussel , turn on the light .
it was just a dream .
you' re here , safe , you see ?
something must be done with that child .
yelling like that .
who knows who might be in the street ?
she' s endangering our lives .
mr. dussel , after all , anne is not exactly a trained frontline soldier .
please , mr. dussel , go back to bed .
she' il be herself in a minute or two , won' t you , annie ?
go back to bed .
hmph .
excuse me .
i' m going to the w. c. , the one room where there' s peace .
go back to bed now .
would you like some water ?
was it a very bad dream ?
perhaps if you told me ?
i' d rather not talk about it .
try to sleep , then .
i' il sit right here beside you .
you don' t have to .
but i' d like to stay with you .
very much , really .
i' d rather you didn' t .
good night
you' il be all right ?
there' s nothing that you want ?
will you please ask father to come ?
yes , of course , anne , dear .
she asked for you .
edith ....
go to her , otto .
she' s still trembling with fear .
she wants nothing of me .
she pulled away when i leaned down to kiss her .
they broke down the door and tried to drag me out , the way they did sanne .
anne .
it' s just a phase .
all girls turn to their fathers at this age .
they give all their love to their fathers .
you weren' t like this .
you didn' t shut me out .
so ....
do you want me to read to you ?
no , just sit with me for a minute .
was i awful ?
do you think anyone outside heard me ?
no .
now , lie down quietly so .
like this .
now try to sleep .
i' m a terrible coward .
i' m so disappointed in myself .
i think i' m really grown up ... ... and then something happens , and i run to you like a baby .
i love you , father .
i don' t love anyone but you .
annele .
annele .
it' s true .
you' re the only one i love .
i' ve been thinking about it for a long time .
it' s fine .
it' s fine to have you tell me that you love me ... ... but i' d be much happier if you said that you loved your mother as well .
she needs your help so much .
your love .
we have nothing in common .
she doesn' t understand me .
whenever i try to explain my views on life , she asks me if i' m constipated .
you hurt her very much just now .
she' s crying .
she is in there crying .
oh , father , i was horrible , wasn' t l ?
what' s the matter with me ?
tell me .
don' t say it' s just a phase .
help me .
there is so little that we parents can do to help our children , annie .
we can only try to set a good example , point the way .
the rest you must do yourself .
i' m trying .
really , i am .
every night , i think back over all the things i did that day that were wrong .
like putting the wet mop in mrs. van daan' s bed .
and now this with mother .
i say to myself , " that was wrong .
and i make up my mind never to do that again .
never .
i may do something worse , but i' il never do that again .
i have a nicer side , father ... ... but i' m scared to show it .
i' m afraid people will laugh at me .
so the mean anne comes to the outside ... ... and the good anne stays in the inside .
and i keep on trying to switch them around ... ... have the good anne outside ... ... and the bad anne inside .
it would be what i' d like to be .
and might be .
if only ....
she' s asleep .
thursday , the 29th of october , 1942 .
mr. dussel and i had a great battle yesterday .
yes , mr. dussel .
according to him , nothing , i repeat , nothing , is right about me .
someday , i' m going to give you such a smack ... ... that you ' il fly right up to the ceiling .
why is it that every grownup thinks he knows the way to bring up children ?
particularly the grownups that haven ' t any .
monday , the 9th of november , 1942 .
wonderful news !
the allies have landed in africa !
that measure of ....
churchill spoke on the bbc from london .
man on radlo : which they have so often meted out to others .
ah , this is not the end .
it is not even the beginning of the end .
no , but it is , perhaps , the end of the beginning .
the air raids are getting worse .
the british planes come over , day and night , on their way to germany .
it' s too much .
it' s just too much .
suppose they hit this house ?
what will we do ?
we can' t go out in the street .
what will we do ?
if they hit this house , your worries will be over .
that big explosion , an english plane fell right in this block !
peter .
peter !
it' s far away from here .
please don' t .
just look at them .
mrs. van daan , this should be music to your ears .
music ?
of course .
the more planes they send , the sooner the war will be over .
the sooner we' il be home again .
i don' t believe it' il ever be over .
do you know what i' d like right now ?
a cup of tea .
oh , yes , please .
you can' t have tea , then , for breakfast .
if you have it now , you won' t have any tomorrow .
i don' t care .
neither do l .
me too , please .
how about you , mr. dussel ?
tea now or tomorrow morning ?
tomorrow morning .
sure ?
sure .
i' il take mine now .
the skylight !
edith , come !
oh , peter !
peter !
peter !
peter !
peter !
praised be thou , lord , ruler of the universe ... ... who' s sanctified us with thy commandments ... ... and bidden us kindle the hannukah lights .
praised be thou , o , lord , our god , ruler of the universe ... ... who wrought wondrous deliverances for our fathers in days of old .
praised be thou , o , lord , our god , ruler of the universe ... ... that thou hast given us life and sustenance ... ... and brought us to this happy season . " amen .
amen .
amen .
monday , the 7th of december , 1942 .
the hannukah holiday came early this year .
we kindle this hannukah light ... ... to celebrate the wonderful deeds wrought through the zeal ... ... with which god filled the hearts of the heroic maccabees 2000 years ago .
they fought against indifference ... ... against tyranny and oppression , and they restored our temple to us .
may these lights remind us that we should ever look to god ... ... whence cometh our help . " amen .
amen .
amen .
i lift up mine eyes unto the mountains from whence cometh my help .
my help cometh from the lord , who made heaven and earth .
he will not suffer thy foot to be moved .
he that keepeth thee will not slumber .
he that keepeth lsrael doth neither slumber nor sleep .
the lord is thy keeper .
the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand .
the lord shall keep thee from all evil .
he shall keep thy soul .
the lord shall guard thy going out and thy coming in ... ... from this time forth and forevermore . " amen .
amen .
amen .
may i have the hats , please ?
thank you .
very nice , very nice .
that was very moving .
it isn' t over yet .
sit down !
where are you going ?
there' s lots more .
songs and presents .
presents ?
not this year , unfortunately .
but always on hannukah , everyone gives presents .
everyone .
that' s right .
like our st. nicholas day .
st. nicholas day .
no , not like st. nicholas day .
what kind of jew doesn' t know hannukah ?
i remember particularly the candles .
first one , as we have tonight .
the second night , two .
the next night , three , and so on , until eight candles are burning .
when there are eight candles , it' s truly beautiful .
what i remember best are the presents we used to get , eight days of presents .
each day , they got better and better .
we are all here , alive .
that' s present enough .
no , it isn' t .
i' ve got something .
