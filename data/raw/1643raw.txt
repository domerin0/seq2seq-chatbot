what' s the matter ?
it' s $2221 .
aren' t we a little short ?
we were sharing up last night .
i thought it' d be three plus .
you stocked 21, 000 pounds at 3 . 50 a pound .
that comes to $73, 000 .
minus $35, 000 for bait , tackle , fuel .
that comes out to $38, 500 .
i get half .
i own the boat .
your captain takes double share , four crewmen get a share each .
and a rookie like you , three quarters share .
that comes to $2221 .

we had to try .
we were so close .
it was a hell of a fight , though , huh ?
let' s get out of here , huh ?
christina .
christina , can you hear me ?
i don' t know if you can , but i' m talking to you , baby .
do you know how much i love you ?
i loved you the moment i saw you .
i love you now ... ... and i' il love you forever .
no goodbye .
there' s only love , christina .
only love .
it' s been a week of round the clock flights involving ... ... efforts of half a dozen northeast air rescue stations .
however , as of this hour , the coast guard has suspended its search ... ... for air national guard para rescue jumper millard jones .
he leaves a wife and three daughters .
the search for the " andrea gail out of gloucester ... ... has also been suspended after aircrafts covered ... ... 116, 000 square miles of ocean ... ... without finding a single survivor .
we' il have more news after these messages .
i knew billy tyne .
i did not know his crew very well .
but any man who sailed with him must' ve been the better for it .
robert shatford ... ... dale murphy ... ... michael moran ... ... david sullivan ... ... alfred pierre ... ... may you rest easy , long liners ... ... in fair winds and calm seas .
for those of us left behind ... ... the unmarked grave which is home for those lost at sea ... ... is of no consolation .
it can' t be visited .
there is no headstone on which to rest a bunch of flowers .
the only place we can revisit them ... ... is in our hearts or in our dreams .
they say swordboatmen suffer from a lack of dreams .
that' s what begets their courage .
well , we' il dream for you ... ... billy ... ... bobby ... ... and murph ... ... bugsy ... ... sully ... ... and alfred pierre .
sleep well .
good night .
i' il be asleep ... ... and then all of a sudden , there he is .
that big smile .
you know that smile .
and i say , " hey , bobby , where you been ?
but he won' t tell me .
remember i' il always love you , christina .
i love you now , and i' il love you forever .
there' s no goodbye .
only love .
and then he' s gone .
but he' s always happy when he goes .
so i know he' s gotta be okay .
absolutely okay .
i love your dream .
the fog' s just lifting .
you throw off your bow line , throw off your stern .
you head out the south channel ... ... past rocky neck , ten pound island ... ... past niles pond , where i skated as a kid .
you blow your horn and wave to ... ... the lighthouse keeper' s kid on thatcher island .
then the birds show up .
black backs and herring gulls ... ... big dump ducks .
the sun hits you .
you head north , open up to 12 .
you' re steaming now .
the guys are busy , you' re in charge .
you know what ?
you' re a goddamn swordboat captain .
is there anything better in the world ?
