jesus !
to the city of san francisco .
i will enjoy killing one person every day ... ... until you pay me one hundred thousand dollars .
if you agree , say so tomorrow morning ... ... at personal column , san francisco chronicle ... ... and i will set up meeting .
if i do not hear from you ... ... it' il be my next pleasure to kill a catholic priest or a ... .
scorpio .
what goes on in their minds ?
kooks .
where the hell does he expect me to find a hundred thousand dollars ?
you' re not thinking of paying him , are you , mr. mayor ?
the city of san francisco does not pay criminals not to commit crimes .
instead , we pay a police department .
chief , who' s in charge of this case ?
inspector callahan .
he' s outside .
send inspector callahan in .
callahan ?
mr. mayor , inspector callahan .
all right .
let' s have it .
have what ?
your report .
what have you been doing ?
for the past 3/ 4 hour ... ... i' ve been sitting on my ass waiting on you .
damn it , harry .
it' s the mayor you' re talking to .
won' t you sit down , inspector callahan ?
there' s a madman loose .
i' ve asked you what' s being done .
fair enough ?
we' ve got a dozen men checking identification files .
checking on all known extortionists , rooftop prowlers ... ... rifle nuts , peepers ...
mr. mayor ?
we' ve arranged for rooftop surveillance and helicopters ... ... especially around the catholic churches and schools ... ... and in the black area .
ballistics is checking on the slug .
we' re sure it' s a 30 06 .
seven lands and grooves , right hand twist ...
we' re running a computer check ... ... on everybody in the files whose birthday falls between ... ... october 23 and november 21 .
why ?
natives of scorpio .
thank you , inspector .
have you mentioned this note to anyone ?
how about you ?
nobody .
your wife , sweetheart ?
press ?
nobody .
all right .
give the message to the chronicle .
we' il pay .
but we need time to get the money together .
wait a minute .
do i get this right ?
you' il play this creep' s game ?
it' il give us breathing space .
it might get somebody killed .
let me meet with the son of a bitch !
nope , none of that .
we would end up with a real bloodbath .
i agree with the chief .
we' il do it this way .
thank you , mr. mayor .
come on , callahan , let' s go .
i don' t want trouble , like you had last year in the fillmore district .
that' s my policy .
when an adult male is chasing a female ... ... with intent to commit rape , i shoot the bastard .
that' s my policy .
intent ?
how did you establish that ?
when a naked man chases a woman in an alley with a knife and a hard on ... ... i figure he isn' t out collecting for the red cross .
i think he' s got a point .
inspector callahan .
jaffe .
usual .
usual lunch , or usual dinner ?
what difference does it make ?
not much .
hey , jaffe ... ... is that tan ford still in front of the bank ?
tan ford ?
yeah , tan ford .
engine running ?
i don' t know .
how can i tell ?
exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe .
that' s awful !
look at that pollution .
do me a favor , will you ?
call this telephone number .
police department ?
tell them inspector callahan thinks there' s a ... ... two eleven in progress at the bank .
got it ?
got it .
be sure and tell them it' s in progress , right ?
in progress .
yes , sir .
now , if they' il just wait till the cavalry arrives .
shit !
halt !
i know what you' re thinking .
did he fire six shots or only five ?
to tell the truth , in all the excitement i' ve kind of lost track myself .
do i feel lucky ?
well , do you , punk ?
i got to know .
son of a bitch !
it looks like we can save that leg .
i' ve got a couple under my knee .
ever consider another line of work ?
i really appreciate this , steve .
we potrero hill boys have to stick together .
nothing fancy , now .
just a little tweezers and mercurochrome .
do i tell you how to beat a confession out of a prisoner ?
i haven' t got all night .
you might experience discomfort .
but if you do , just have your wife fix a ... .
sorry , harry .
what will you do with those ?
cut your pants off .
no .
we' il pull them off .
it' il hurt .
for $29 . 50 , let it hurt .
you can turn your back if you' re embarrassed .
good morning , inspector .
maria .
you wanted to see me , lieutenant ?
when the hell you going to get a haircut ?
whenever you do .
who' s got time ?
i was up till 3 a . m . checking the search patterns .
put in for overtime .
that' il be the day .
you made a good pinch .
chief was pleased .
he was ?
well done !
i can' t tell you how moved i am .
i pass along a compliment ... ... you could be a little polite .
it might not kill you to say thanks .
i' d rather say thanks to a raise .
harry , check communications .
something from chicago .
a gun nut .
i' il get right on it .
now wait a minute !
i' m putting somebody with you .
what are you talking about ?
you need a partner .
what' s wrong with the one i' ve got ?
he' s in the hospital !
he' il be out in a few weeks .
say hello to chico gonzales .
he' il be working with you .
you must be kidding .
i have no time to break in newcomers .
why don' t you do this boy a favor ?
what do you mean ?
you know what happens to guys i worked with .
deitzick' s in the hospital ... ... and fanduchi' s dead .
so ?
if i need a partner , i' il get me one who knows what he' s doing .
what about de georgio ?
no way !
you work with gonzales or you don' t work .
straight from the fifth floor .
got it ?
i got it .
if you see de georgio , send him in here !
you from around here ?
yeah , but i went to san jose state .
play ball ?
no , i boxed .
light heavyweight .
just what i need is a college boy .
found anything you like about me yet ?
it' s early yet .
get your degree ?
sociology .
sociology !
you' il go far , if you live .
i intend to .
inspector callahan .
don' t let your degree get you killed .
i' m liable to get killed with you .
i' il remember that .
hero !
nice work yesterday .
fatso !
bressler wants to see you .
you' re a sweet man , harry .
there is one question , inspector callahan .
why do they call you dirty harry ?
that' s one thing about our harry .
doesn' t play favorites .
harry hates everybody : limeys , micks , hebes , dagos , niggers , honkies , chinks .
you name it .
how does he feel about mexicans ?
ask him !
especially spics .
hey !
there' s a guy on the roof over there !
on stockton street by washington square .
you , on the roof !
you , there !
yes , you .
stop what you' re doing .
turn around and put your hands in the air .
i don ' t know how the helicopter boys lost him !
how could they let him get out without seeing him ?
they were probably talking instead of looking , like they were supposed to .
that' s possible .
attention , all units .
turn that thing up louder .
prowler last seen in the vicinity of washington square .
he is an adult male .
caucasian .
repeat , adult male caucasian .
when last seen , he was wearing tan chinos ... ... pale blue shirt , brown coat or sweater , dark gloves .
he had a tan suitcase ... ... which probably contains a 30 06 rifle .
he' s wanted ...
those loonies !
they ought to throw a net over the whole bunch !
i know what you mean .
there !
what ?
tan suitcase .
where ?
i lost him .
there he goes , over there .
does that bag look tan ?
i don' t know , i haven' t even seen him yet .
go to filber and hang a left .
look out for these people !
fruitcake !
get out of the way , hammerhead !
it was a tan suitcase .
i know it was .
i saw him .
there he is .
i see him .
car 2 , the license number ... ... at 10 32 on that chevrolet , colorado plates .
how do you want to work this ?
find another entrance .
i' il go in here .
car 2 , what' s the model of that chevrolet ?
car 2 .
it' s an impala convertible .
10 4 .
you can cancel that 10 25 .
three cars here .
anybody home ?
i brought you a nice present .
let me see it .
it' s beautiful !
why don' t you go get a nice container of egg rolls ?
you getting an eyeful ?
you goddamn pie hawker !
we should call the police .
i am a police ...
up against the wall .
right now !
move .
let them go .
let them go ?
you heard me .
they assaulted a police officer .
a police officer !
he was standing on a can peeking in ... ... on hot mary and her boyfriend !
beat it .
get out of here .
how about the man with the suitcase ?
wrong number .
i just had another thought .
yeah ?
about what ?
about why they call you dirty harry .
inspector 71 .
inspector 71 .
please respond to your call .
inspector 71 .
do you read me ?
this is inspector 71 .
i' ve got an 8 0 4 in progress .
california hall at polk and turk streets .
10 4 .
we' re on our way .
it' s some idiot .
where ?
i don' t see him .
there he is .
yeah .
now i see him .
i have a 10 29 and a 10 28 .
in 600 block of baker .
on a chevrolet .
california license d dog , c charles , v victor 4 7 2 .
we thought it was your sniper , but it turned out to be a suicide attempt .
anybody try to talk him down ?
yeah , no luck .
but now you' re here ... .
you mean , i go up .
we' d sure appreciate it .
don' t you try to get me !
not me .
you' re the one who wants to get yourself killed .
not me .
always happens with you guys .
the last minute you want to ... ... grab onto somebody , take somebody with you .
down you go .
not me !
won' t you try to grab me ?
a friend of mine was up about 20 floors with a jumper a few years ago .
the jumper grabbed him and they went off .
mashed all over .
couldn' t tell which legs was with which , which arms with which ... .
it was a terrible mess .
i tell you , i almost threw up myself .
i' d just like your name and address .
why ?
it' s such a mess down there afterwards !
it makes identification impossible .
even if they find your driver' s license !
all that blood !
i think i' m going to puke !
don' t do that , son .
all those people down there looking up .
the fire chief looking up .
with his face ... .
you bastard !
get the stretcher up here .
now you know why i' m called dirty harry .
every dirty job that comes along .
inspector 71 .
this is inspector 71 .
got something for you .
corner of sierra and texas .
a young boy , negro .
what about him ?
shot in the face .
blew part of it away .
anybody know who the boy is ?
his name was charlie russell .
i' m his mother .
he' s only 10 years old .
inspector , this officer ...
oh , jesus christ !
you' d better go check on the mother .
what do you have ?
that 30 06 shell casing .
he was up here all right .
welcome to homicide .
the man who designed blue serge uniforms for police departments ... ... has to sell these for a living !
. 458 magnum ?
this thing will stop an elephant .
yeah .
apparently you like a little edge .
all i can get , sir .
he' s no elephant , harry .
he' s no animal of any kind .
what have you got , lieutenant ?
the blue flags represent the units that are going to be on duty by dark tonight .
double shifts and overtime .
at nighttime .
daylight , the helicopters will keep him off the roofs .
we' re going for high visibility .
units will make themselves very noticeable .
except here .
right .
the north beach area .
we' re saving that for him .
have you found a good stakeout ?
i think so .
it' s a building that overlooks the roof where they spotted him yesterday .
something bothering you ?
nothing .
speak up .
you' re among friends here .
it seems a long shot that he' d come back to the same roof .
there are a lot of rooftops in san francisco .
most of them are locked .
this particular one' il be open for him .
these sick guys have behavior patterns .
we know they' il rob the very same store 3 , 4 times in a row .
must appeal to their superego or something .
scorpio strikes again .
they like that feeling .
there' s one other reason why he might pick the same rooftop .
he' s got a clear view of the st. peter and paul' s church .
and they' re having a novena tonight .
go on .
the note .
he threatened to kill a priest or a negro .
the russell boy was black .
he may just figure he owes himself a padre .
inspector 71 .
we' re in position to start our surveillance .
how about the priest ?
he knows he' s being set up for bait ?
yeah , he wanted to .
we told him we had a volunteer willing to take his place .
who ?
never guess .
yeah , i know .
welcome to homicide .
you owe it to yourself to live a little , harry .
son of a bitch took the bait !
when i say " now , " hit him with the light .
now !
you all right ?
i think so .
call an ambulance .
collins never knew what hit him .
let' s go .
clear the alley .
there' s nothing to see .
call headquarters .
he' s loose in north beach .
it' s a whole new ball game , fellows .
he grabbed a 14 year old girl .
ann mary deacon .
the bomb squad got a call .
suspicious object in golden gate park .
it was addressed to the mayor .
the lab sent it to us , with this letter inside .
ann mary deacon , buried alive .
the poor kid went to the movies last night and never came home .
double crossing san francisco police made me do this .
now ransom $200, 000 , in used tens and twenties .
one man with yellow bag .
south side marina .
green east harbor .
9 p . m .
she has oxygen till 3 a . m . tomorrow .
red panties and bra .
nice tits .
mole on left thigh .
anything cute and you' il force me to let girl die ... ... of slow suffocation .
signed , scorpio .
anything else ?
the mother identified the bra ... ... the hank of hair ... ... and that .
the dentist identified that .
said it was pulled out with a pair of pliers .
you know she' s dead .
all i know is the letter says she' il be alive until 3 a . m .
the mayor' s out trying to put the money together now .
he' s using up a lot of favors .
he wants to pay .
no tricks .
we need a bag man .
you want the job ?
you got it .
be in the chief' s office at 6 p . m .
all right .
wait a minute .
what about me ?
you' re out .
no cover ?
not even one man ?
sure that' s how to do it ?
i' m not sure !
but those are my orders .
all right ?
no wonder they call him dirty harry .
he gets the shit end of the stick .
one more word and you' re chopped off at the ankles .
al , let' s split the difference .
give him the night off .
get the hell out of here , both of you .
testing 1 , 2 , 3 ...
what are you yelling for ?
all you have to do is whisper .
mary had a little lamb , its fleece as white as snow .
okay , that' s better .
it' s good for 2 or 3 blocks .
but in a tunnel ... ... forget it .
all right , sid .
what do i owe you ?
bring it back in one piece .
$200, 000 .
count it and sign for it .
did you count it out ?
did you count it , chief ?
it' s not my responsibility .
always knew i' d get rich on the police force .
just make sure nobody takes it away from you .
god knows how he' il contact you .
he' il probably run you all over town .
go where you' re told .
do what you' re told .
play it straight down the line .
okay ?
nothing cute .
nothing fancy .
just pay the ransom money and report back here .
would you mind if i borrowed a little scotch tape ?
it' s disgusting that a police officer should know how to use that weapon .
you got a yellow suitcase ?
yeah , i got it right with me .
what' s your name ?
callahan .
what are you ?
police officer .
hello ?
all right , police officer ... ... this is how we play .
i bounce you all over town to make sure you' re alone .
if i even think you' re being followed , the girl dies .
if you talk to anyone , even if it' s a pekinese pissing on a lamppost ... ... the girl dies .
is the girl okay ?
just shut up and listen .
no car .
i give you some time to go from phone booth to phone booth .
i ring 4 times .
you don ' t answer by the fourth ring ... ... that' s the end of the game .
the girl dies .
what time you got ?
9 : 30 .
now listen ...
you listen .
i' m watching you .
not all the time , but you' il never know when or where .
now get to forest hills station as fast as you can .
understand ?
yeah .
i hope you' re not stupid .
downstairs .
take the " k " car .
get off at church and 20th .
hurry up , or you' il blow it .
you sound like you had a good rest .
you' il need it .
i' m going to give you a nice little run this time .
you better make it , because if you don ' t , dead girl !
public phone , hamburger stand , aquatic park .
hubba hubba hubba , pig bastard .
what' s in the bag , man ?
you dudes get lost now , you hear ?
screw the bag !
just give us the wallet .
you don' t listen , do you , asshole ?
don' t answer that !
who picked it up ?
some old guy .
never saw him before .
chico , he hung up .
you know mt .
davidson park ?
yeah .
go to the cross .
i' m at the entrance on lansdale street .
i' m going up .
i see a couple of people .
just a couple of kids necking .
boys or girls ?
i' m callahan .
my friends call me alice .
and i will take a dare .
when was the last time you were busted ?
if you' re a vice , i' il kill myself .
well , do it at home .
freeze !
just like a statue .
that' s right .
one wrong move , anything , i don' t care .
i' il kill you and the girl both .
understand ?
yeah .
drop the bag .

let' s see the gun .

that' s a big one .
left hand .

easy .
raise your hands .
come on , get them up .
now turn .
face the cross .
come on .
put your nose right up against the cement .
you lift that hand once more and i won' t let you know where the girl is !
do we understand each other ?
do we understand each other ?
don' t pass out on me yet !
no , no .
no , no .
not yet .
not yet !
don' t pass out on me yet , you rotten oinker !
do we understand each other ?
if you care what happens to the girl , you' d better answer me !
all right ?
listen to me carefully .
i' ve changed my mind .
i' m going to let her die .
i just wanted you to know that .
you understand ?
i ijust wanted to make sure you knew that before i killed you .
goodbye , callahan !
chico , don' t kill him !
the hospital report on gonzales looks okay , chief .
yeah .
well , he' s a pretty tough kid .
he' s right here .
he' s got two cracked ribs .
they want to do some more tests on him in the morning .
the son of a bitch really kicked him a couple of beauts .
i' m sending him home .
right , chief .
he says beat it !
that' s an order .
the chief wants to know if i misunderstood his orders .
meaning , am i just plain stupid or did i deliberately disobey him ?
he wants to know what gonzales was doing there .
he wants to know why we screwed everything up .
what am i going to tell him ?
why don' t you start by telling him the truth ?
tell him gonzales was obeying orders from a superior .
me .
tell him you didn' t know anything about it .
when this is over , if he wants my badge , he can have that too .
you wouldn' t have a belt of booze around here , would you ?
lieutenant bressler' s office .
put him on .
what is it ?
it' s park emergency .
they just treated a guy who had a knife wound in the leg .
yeah , doctor ?
what' d this guy look like ?
long blond hair ... ... medium build , about 150 pounds .
pale complexion .
he didn' t give you his name , doc ?
nope .
they usually give a phony name .
but i' ve seen him someplace .
it' s important you remember .
there' s a 14 year old girl who' s suffocating .
i' m trying to think !
it was ... .
i believe he works around here .
doctor , could you give him something ?
he' s in pain !
yes , just a moment .
she' il be dead in an hour !
i' m trying to remember !
i' ve got who he is .
when they had football , he used to sell programs at the stadium .
i think the groundskeeper lets him live there .
live where ?
there .
kezar stadium .
illegal entry .
no warrant .
looks like we climb .
too much linguine .
i' il find another way .
stop !
don' t do anything more !
you tried to kill me !
you need any help ?
go on and get some air , fatso .
please !
no more !
can' t you see i' m hurt ?
you shot me !
please , don' t !
let me have a doctor !
please , get me the doctor !
don' t kill me !
the girl , where is she ?
you tried to kill me !
if i did , your head would be splattered all over this field .
where' s the girl ?
i want a lawyer .
i said , where' s the girl ?
i have the right for one .
where' s the girl ?
i have the right to a lawyer !
don' t !
please !
i have rights .
i want a lawyer !
harry callahan .
he said it was urgent .
yes , the district attorney has been wanting to talk to you .
it' s inspector callahan .
have him come in , please .
won' t you come this way ?
may i bring you in a cup of coffee ?
no , thanks .
i' il be done in a minute .
have a seat .
i' ve just been looking over your arrest report .
a very unusual piece of police work .
really amazing .
i had some luck .
you' re lucky i' m not indicting you for assault with intent to commit murder !
where does it say you' ve got a right to kick down doors , torture suspects ?
deny medical attention and legal counsel ?
where have you been ?
does escobedo ring a bell ?
miranda ?
you must have heard of the 4th amendment !
what i' m saying is , that man had rights .
i' m all broken up about that man' s rights .
you should be .
i' ve got news for you .
when he' s well enough to leave the hospital , he walks .
what are you talking about ?
he' s free !
you' re letting him go ?
we have to .
we can' t try him .
and why is that ?
because i' m not wasting 1 / 2 million tax dollars ... ... on a trial we can' t possibly win .
the problem is , we don' t have any evidence .
what do you call that ?
i call it nothing .
zero .
you' re saying that ballistics can' t match the bullet up to this rifle ?
it does not matter what ballistics can do !
this rifle might make a nice souvenir .
but it' s inadmissible as evidence !
who says ?
it' s the law .
then the law is crazy !
this is judge bannerman of the appellate court .
he also holds classes in constitutional law .
i' ve asked him for an opinion .
your honor ?
in my opinion , the search of the suspect' s quarters was illegal .
evidence obtained thereby , such as that hunting rifle for instance ... ... is inadmissible in court .
you should have gotten a search warrant .
i' m sorry .
it' s that simple .
search warrant ?
a girl was dying !
she was , in fact , dead according to the medical report !
but i didn' t know that !
the court would recognize the officer' s legitimate concern for the girl ... ... but there is no way they can possibly condone police torture .
all evidence concerning the girl , the suspect' s confession ... ... physical evidence ... ... would have to be excluded .
there must be something you can get him on !
without the evidence of the gun and the girl ?
i couldn' t convict him of spitting on the sidewalk !
now , the suspect' s rights ... ... were violated ... ... under the 4th and 5th ... ... and probably the 6th and 14th amendments .
and ann mary deacon , what about her rights ?
she' s raped and left in a hole to die !
who speaks for her ?
the district attorney' s office !
if you' il let us .
i have a wife and 3 kids .
i don' t want him on the streets any more than you do .
he won' t be out there long .
what is that supposed to mean ?
sooner or later he will stub his toe and i' il be there .
this office won' t stand for any harassment !
you' re crazy if you think you' ve heard the last of him .
he will kill again .
how do you know ?
because he likes it .
you sure you weren' t tailed ?
yeah .
you really want $200 worth .
every penny of it .
might as well be comfortable .
go on , sit .
relax .
take it easy .
it' s going to be all right .
you sure you want the rest of it ?
every penny' s worth !
you black son of a bitch !
this one' s on the house .
that' s got to be him .
are you claiming that the san francisco police did this to you ?
i swear it .
as god is my judge .
why are they harassing you ?
they tried to frame me with the murder .
and now they' re trying to murder me .
and look at me !
i' m supposed to be innocent until proven guilty and look at what they did to me .
everywhere i go cops follow me .
and just look at me !
just a minute , nurse .
let me ask him one more question .
did you see who did this to you ?
can you identify him ?
his name is callahan .
he' s a big cop .
works homicide .
callahan .
now , that' s the rerun from the 4 o' clock news .
since then he' s given a statement to the chronicle .
he claims you' ve been following him .
and beat him up .
what about it , harry ?
you want my star ?
i want an answer .
have you been following him ?
yeah , i' ve been following him on my own time .
anybody can tell i didn' t do that .
how ?
because he looks too damn good , that' s how !
before i let you go , let' s get one thing straight .
i don' t want any more surveillance !
neither does he .
what does that mean ?
good night , sir .
go ahead .
try them .
guy makes them where i always eat .
thank you .
i talked to bressler about being on with me .
so you know you got a spot when you get out .
i don' t know if i am coming back , harry .
doing a lot of thinking about it and ... .
i have a teaching credential .
and i figure ... ... what for ?
you know ?
time for therapy .
you hang in there now .
see you tomorrow .
same time ?
it' s my fault , you know .
what ?
his leaving .
i thought i could take it .
no class .
don' t ever say that .
what ?
don' t ever low rate yourself .
what i meant was , whatever it takes to be a cop' s wife ... ... i' m just not sure i' m making it .
he really tries , and all these bastards ... ... " pig " this and " pig " that .
but maybe it' s when i watch him walk out that door at night .
and i think ... ... what if it' s the last time i see him ?
am i the only one ?
doesn' t it drive your wife crazy ?
no .
you mean she got used to it ?
no , she never did , really .
what , then ?
she' s dead .
please , forgive me .
she was driving home and a drunk crossed the center line .
no reason for it , really .
i' m so sorry .
that' s okay .
