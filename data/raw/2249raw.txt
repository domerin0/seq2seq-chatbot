oh ; thank you ; arnold .
l i can manage that .
but i still don' t see why you couldn' t wait a couple of weeks .
why go all the way up to loki ?
well ; we want to hear grace makanga speak ; and she won' t be coming to nairobi .
i see .
oh , sweetheart , don' t bother to see us off .
it could be ages .
okay , well [ kissing ]
it' s too hot to be standing around .
if you' re sure .
bye .
bye , arnold .
let me take your bag for you .
thank you .
bye , sweetheart .
see you in , uh in a couple of days .
sandy , he' s here .
hi .
come in .
oh , hi , sandy .
you caught me skiving , i' m afraid .
how' s gloria ?
well ?
gloria' s fine .
you haven' t heard from tessa , i suppose ?
no , she' s , uh , up north with , um , arnold bluhm .
look , old chap , do you think you could stop doing that a moment ?
something wrong ?
she didn' t say anything about returning by road ?
from loki ?
well , that wouldn' t surprise me , knowing tessa .
i mean , i hope not .
dangerous country .
what is it , sandy ?
we' re getting reports of a white woman , black driver , found early this morning ; southern end of lake turkana ; dead killed ; it seems .
you think it might be tessa ?
seems they hired a car and driver in loki and then headed east .
they spent the night at lodwar .
they shared a room ; justin .
the dead black isn' t arnold bluhm .
most terribly sorry .
and how sure are you ?
it' s not looking good .
it' s ... good of you to tell me , sandy .
can' t have been easy .
diplomacy ; therefore ; as we' ve demonstrated ; is the very map and marker of civilization , pointing nations the safest way through country ... fraught with peril .
and that' s it .
uh ; sir bernard pellegrin has asked me to convey his ; uh ; regrets ... that he' s been unable to deliver his lecture in person .
and i thank you on my own behalf for your very kind attention .
thank you .
excuse me .
excuse me .
yeah ?
yeah , sorry .
excu excuse me .
sir , i' ve just got one question .
i just wondered whose map , um , is britain using ... when it completely ignores the united nations and decides to invade iraq ?
or do you do you think ... it' s more diplomatic to bend to the will of a superpower ... and and politely take part in vietnam ; the sequel ?
well , uh , l i can' t speak for sir bernard
oh , i thought that' s why you were here .
i mean , diplomats have to go where they' re sent .
so do labradors .
ooh .
ouch .
well ; i think that ; no ; sir bernard would no doubt argue ... that when , um , peaceful means are exhausted , then exhausted ?
mr. quayle ; they' re not exactly exhausted ; are they ?
i mean , they' re just they' re just no , they are just lying in the way of the tanks .
no ; l l let' s face it .
we' ve taken 60 years ... to build up this international organization called the united nations , which is meant to avoid wars ,
and now we just blow it up because our car' s running out of petrol .
sit down , tessa , for christ' s sake .
l i think  hold on a minute .
let' s see what he says .
i think the questioner is making a valid point , and that a nation' s foreign policy ...
should not be determined by narrow commercial interests .
that' s bullshit .
that' s bullshit .
you have to take responsibility .
you are being paid to apologize for this pathetic country of britain , and he can explain to us why we' ve burned our diplomatic credentials ... and why we' re killing , you know , thousands of innocent people ... just for just for some barrels of oil ... and a photo opportunity on the white house lawn .
why ?
are you all right ?
yes , thanks .
you were courageous .
no .
no ; i was completely rude .
it was just bad behavior , and l  you were impassioned .
i' m so embarrassed .
sorry .
please don' t be embarrassed .
i' m really sorry .
and , uh , thanks very much .
you ... tried to protect me .
very feebly .
no , you were you were you weren' t feeble .
i just
anyway , it was a very dull lecture .
it was a dull lecture , but even so i shouldn' t have
well , look , can l can i buy you a coffee or
i owe you a drink .

i' m justin , by the way .
tessa .

pleased to meet you .
yeah , yeah .
pleased to meet you .
you were quite scary , but i don' t blame you .
it was absolute bollocks , so you' re quite right to challenge
i' m rather nervous , i have to confess .

oh , do come in .
yeah , please .
of course .
thank you .
you lead the way .
go ahead .

very funny .
i' d have to smuggle you in as illicit goods .
i couldn' t declare you .
oh , listen .
i could put you in one of these plant boxes , and
you' d be very comfortable wrapped up in a little piece of , uh
i could label you .
tessa .
i' m serious .
um , yeah , i can see you are .
and in what what capacity should i take you to africa ?
i don' t mind .
you can take me as your mistress , lover , wife .
there' s too much choice .
l well , i' m
i' m flattered that you would like no .
no .
justin , please don' t say that sentence .
sorry .
sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
that' s really
just yes or no ?

i' m completely inept with computers .
i' m gonna keep it .
i' m sorry .

i was there the other night meeting someone with arnold .
oh , well , just a thought .

i would love to , but maybe after ...
arturo is born .
oh , tessa .
we' re not calling him arturo , please .

no .
not not arturo ... or giuseppe all right .
then what about ...
garth daddy' s name ?
no , no .
come on .
no , not garth or ditto che or any
che ?
i just don' t want any of these mad , eccentric , hippieish
che ?
alternative yes , your revolutionary half .
i think we should call him , in that case , che muffin quayle .
muffin ?
yes , the quayle genes .
where do you get muffin from ?
no one' s heard of muffins .
high tea by the jolly study fire ... while the starving mob burns london .
is that is that how you see me ?
no .
i see you buying the mob fish and chips ... while you wait for law and order to return .
and i love you the way you are .
what about arnold ?
what about arnold ?
as a name .
hmm .
be such a nice gesture .
well , perhaps it' il be a girl .
mmm .
i think it' s a boy .
i think it' s a girl .
you' d better get dressed .
move that tray .
dry these glasses .
can you open your windows , please ?
please get out of the car .
dr. joshua ngaba , kenya health ministry .
sir bernard pellegrin , head of f. c. o. africa desk .
may i convey her majesty' s warmest greetings ?
i thought that arnold was going up country .
he is .
oh , don' t worry .
he' s not gonna take me .
i' ve already asked him .
hmm .
good .
and , tessa yes ?
i' d be happier if you stayed out of kibera , at least until the baby' s born anyway .
um , just you wait until i' m single again .
hello , tim .
how are you ?
hi .
are you struggling through without maude tonight ?
one of her party headaches .
i take mine standing up .
oh , how manly of you .
isn' t it just ?
hello , arnold .
tessa .
hello , ghita , darling .
ooh , what a lovely sari .
interesting guests ; mr. donohue .
this is kenya ; dr. bluhm .
seems only fair to invite the odd native .
mmm .
the health minister' s turn , was it ?
so it seems .
who' s that he' s talking to ?
i have no idea .
thought your spies knew everything , tim .
only god knows everything .
he works for mossad .
you' ve met dr. ngaba , have you ?
yes , at the opening of a new state of the art clinic ... without autoclaves for sterilizing .
mmm .
probably converted them into a mercedes .
hmm .
i' ve never met an alchemist before .
tessa , darling .
ah , tessa .
hello , porter .
may i introduce tessa quayle , dr. ngaba , the wife of our representative for aid effectiveness ?
pleasure to meet you .
how do you do ?
and this is dr. bluhm from mdecins dans i' univers .
good evening .
dr. bluhm and i have met .
yes , it was at the opening for the clinic that didn' t have the sterilizing equipment .
we never met ; dr. ngaba ; but i know your work .
do you know sir kenneth curtiss , chief executive ofthreebees ?
yes ; also by reputation .
good evening .
good evening .
it' s the most successful company here in kenya .
we' re very proud ofhim .
and which of the bees are you ?
you were going to show us the garden room , porter .
there is just one thing that i' d like to thank dr. ngaba for the free nevirapine .
he' s , uh , persuaded the manufacturers to donate it to h. i. v. positive mothers .
it' s a wonderful thing .
shall we ?
the problem is , it isn' t actually reaching them .
some , but not all .
so we' ve been wondering , is that a standard cock up , dr. ngaba , or or were the pills converted into the limo that you arrived in ?
i think that' s probably enough .
if you' il come through here , doctor .
justin .
excuse me .
you' ve gotta do something about tessa .
well , what would you like me to do , sandy ?
well , she' s embarrassing our guests .
her and that bloody bluhm .
there' il be hell to pay , i can tell you .
well , the the squall seems to have passed .
if you can' t control her , you should keep her locked up .
you' re wanted on the veranda ; mr. woodrow .
yes .
the poinsettias are so big here , they' il be best towards the back of the border .
hey , sexy .
you look divine .
sandy , i think you' re a pervert .
stop looking at me like that .
we' re to have a baby in a week .
can i come and visit you in the hospital ?
you want to visit me in uhuru ?
uhuru ?
tessa , you' re not having it there .
oh , sandy , come on .
kibera women have their babies there every day .
it' s perfectly safe .
no , it' s not .
it' s madness .
just can i just choose wait a minute .
that looks a good one .
shall we run away ?
yeah , come on then .
take me for lunch .
how are you ?
i' m fine .
thank you .
how are you ?
i' m fine .
thank you .
how are you ?
how are you ?
i' m fine .
thank you .
how are you ?
i' m fine .
how are you ?
look , near the car .
jomo is getting a test .
of course .
you told him to .
it was a suggestion , not an order .
what are they carrying in those littlejars ?
it' s probably saliva .
but that' s not how you test for h. i. v. here ; is it ?
they' re also testing for t. b. why ?
when they test for h. i. v. , they also test for t. b. free here .
what , just for free ?
a small extra service to humanity .
they' re a drug company , arnold .
come on .
no drug company does something for nothing .
is there ... something you' re not telling me
arnold ?
hello , sandy .
i' m so sorry , tessa .
gloria sends her sympathies .
what can one say ?
it was a boy .
did justin already tell you that ?
tessa .
tessa .
this one was born healthy though .
weren' t you ; my beautiful ; beautiful darling ?
his name is baraka .
it means blessing .
i ... don' t quite see .
who the mother is ?
her name is wanza kilulu .
she' s 15 ; and she' s dying .
kioko' s 12 .
he walked 40 kilometers just to keep the flies off his sister and her baby .
perhaps that' s the blessing .
darling ; please don' t .
please sit here , mr. woodrow .
i' il wait outside .
thank you .
kioko , here you are .
you sweetheart .
justin , my darling , could you please go and get me a fresh bottle of water ?
hmm ?
sure .
now , sandy ?
yes ?
if i tell you something , will you listen to me ?
not here , tessa .
no , sandy , if i tell you that that that that girl over there was being murdered , would you believe me ?
tessa , you' re tired .
you' re feverish .
no .
no , i' m not .
now we haven' t got all of the evidence yet , but when we get it , if i bring it to you , will you will you actually do something for once ?
what you need is rest .
now what i' m i' m talking about are coincidences .
tessa , you' ve got to stop involving yourself in matters that don' t concern you .
you' re embarrassing the high commission , and you' re not doing justin' s career any good .
justin doesn' t know what i do .
that doesn' t surprise me .
sandy , you' ve got to promise me ... that you' re going to act on what we tell you .
we ?
me and arnold .
please ?
all right .
i promise .
within reason .
within reason .
uh , there' s a man .
she' s raving mad .
you' ve got to get her to a proper clinic .
with white doctors , mr. woodrow ?
for christ' s sake , justin , she' s your wife .
yes , she' s my wife .
you see ; she' s dead .
what did you give her ?
it doesn' t matter .
dr. lorbeer ; you have got to stop testing on patients with h. i. v.
it look at me .
i have to go .
justin , stop the car .
stop , stop , stop .
why ?
what is it ?
tessa .
it' s 40 kilometers to miluri .
it' s gonna take them all night .
we can' t involve ourselves in their lives , tessa .
why ?
be reasonable .
there are millions of people .
they all need help .
that' s what the agencies are here for .
yeah , but these are three people that we can help .
please .
justin .
i' m sorry , tessa .
i have to put you first .
i have to get you home .
probably got enough there now ; mustafa .
yeah ?
i think .
just the flowers this time , please .
you can spare the weeds .
the pest must eat too , bwana .
yes , i know .
if only they would .
they can eat the weeds .
look , you should be wearing gloves with that , you know ?
and there' s a mask if you want it .
okay .
it' s an outrageous thing .
it' s almost as if it' s a it' s a marriage of convenience shh .
tessa .
and the only thing it' s gonna produce is dead offspring .
i' m sorry to interrupt .
what the fuck is that ?
what ?
i said , what the fuck is that ?
tessa , it' s pesticide .
it it' s just unbelievable .
would you just get that thing out of this house ?
well , if you feel that strongly about it , yes , tessa anything .
it would help if you might explain to me what' s upsetting her .
i mean , this doesn' t kill people , does it ?
unless they swallow it ?
no .
what ?
then can you tell me why she' s so
you have to trust her , justin .
it' s hard , you know , when she we don' t talk about
does she blame me for losing the baby ?
of course not .
give her time .
tell her i' il be back later .
wherever there are drug companies ... testing their drugs on people who they think are expendable ; you' il find organizations like ours trying to fight back .
of course , the problem is that they have millions to spend on p. r ... while we work with volunteers and a few donated computers .
if you' re gonna dig deeper ; then most of us have web sites .
check out oxfam ; m. s. f. ; health action international
put it in here .
just mind the roses , please , mustafa .
hi ; birgit .
sorry .
more questions .
tessa never sleeps .
always time for you , tessa .
take care of yourself ; tessa ; okay ?
i think you' re a bit [ german ]
i' m very tired .
i' m sorry .
i can' t translate that word to you .
so you' d better ask that kind , nice husband of yours
okay .
see you ; tessa .
hi .
hi .
it' s bloody awful weather .
you really shouldn' t have waited up .
good .
then i think you should go to bed .
i' m safe home now , sweetheart .
no , you' re drenched .
look , take those wet things off .
tessa , come to bed with me , please .
yeah , l
i will , but there' s , um , something i have to do first .
it' s important .
tessa , whatever it is that you and arnold are doing ;
i' d like it to stop .
wow .
who have you been talking to ?
no one .
these are my concerns , all right ?
i' m thinking of your health .
no .
no , you' re not .
they' ve asked you to rein me in , and you' re doing it .
it' s just unbelievable .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i hope you know me better than that .
your life is your own .
that was always our agreement .
no .
no , no .
the agreement was ... that my work was gonna be my own .
that' s what makes me who i am .
i mean , if you stop me from doing my work , then i am nothing .
i' m just nobody .
l
i' m not trying to stop you doing anything .
please .
i' m sorry .
i' m just tired .
that' s all .
very tired .
then come to bed .
hmm ?
will you get me up for breakfast ?
i' ve got to finish my report .
just smash it like that .
oh . !
right .
now if you just put those there .
you want probably to break them up into smaller pieces .
a bit more vermilion .
oh , you' re just very blas , aren' t you ?
you know , just through feel .
no , i wouldn' t no .
i wouldn' t call it a parasite ; no .
you' re gonna be late for your match .
quick , quick , quick , quick !
kenny , i can' t discuss this on the phone .
that cow of yours wouldn' t even give me an appointment .
time was you buggers couldn' t get your tongues far enough up my arse .
what' s changed ?
hi .
if i find out that this has got anything to do with that bitch
come to my office .
l i' ve got to go , kenny .
bye .
having trouble with threebees , sandy ?
just kenny being kenny .
oh .
nothing to do with my report then ?
oh , he' s just ranting .
oh , sandy , you promised me you were gonna do something .
i sent your report to london .
really ?
yes .
to pellegrin ?
yes .
and ?
there was no official response .
well , what was there then ?
well , just a personal letter .
that' s all .
saying ?
it' s private .
what do you mean , it' s private ?
that' s the most ridiculous thing i' ve ever heard .
i sent him an official document .
i gonna have to call pellegrin and ask him .
no , no .
don' t do that , tessa .
why ?
it' s serious .
you know me well enough to know that i' m not gonna take no for an answer .
come on .
tessa ,
i' m supposed to keep an eye on you .
what ?
report where you are , what you' re doing .
trust me , tessa .
this is something that you should not pursue .
i say that as a friend who cares deeply for you .
sandy ?
oh , tessa .
hi , gloria .
been wondering where you' d got to .
darling , you know , we really have to leave now .
match starts in half an hour .
harry' s got a cricket match .
that is , you' re still coming , right ?
yes , of course .
you' re not too busy , no ?
one sec .
right .
okay .
justin' s waiting for you in the car .

sandy , what do you think of me ?
i think you' re beautiful .
do you ?
yes .
really ?
yes .
well , you can have me if you show me the letter .
ooh .

yeah .
when ?
um , when i get back from loki .
tessa , if anyone ever found out [ car horn honks ]
i' d shown you the letter , i' d be ruined .
no one' s gonna know , sandy .
put it back in the drawer .
lock the drawer .
put the key back .
read it at once .
promise ?
promise .
my continent , africa , is staggering ... under the weight of not one , but three plagues .
yet still the governments of the u. s. a. and europe ; at the behest of the pharmaceutical companies that seem to control them ; drag their feet and continue to give us endless reasons ... why we should buy your branded drugs at five ; 10 ; 20 times the price .
sweetheart , don' t bother to see us off .
it could be ages .
okay , well , if you' re sure .
it' s too hot to be standing around .
bye , arnold .
let me take your bag for you .
thank you .
bye , sweetheart .
see you in , uh in a couple of days .
tessa .
tessa ?
yeah .
the bodies were locked inside a car and had been mutilated .

certainly .
sorry .
mr. quayle . !
mustafa .
mmm .
tessa' s family .
yes .
police were here ; bwana .
when ?
this morning .
they took away mama tessa' s things .
better make a list of what' s missing .
mustafa .
see ?
i told you .
they took away the cd' s , the diskettes , the computer .
they came here and took the the files , the papers .
just didn' t want to touch anything so that you can come and see for yourself what they did .
okay , thank you .
thank you , mustafa .
dypraxa ?
huh .
darling tessa ; you have hurt me more than you know .
trusting you to be honorable ; i afforded you ; against all the rules ; an opportunity that you have abused in the worst way .
i beg you ; for the sake of my career ; to return what you took .
if you will not ; then at least save what is left of me ... by chucking in your ridiculous sham of a marriage ; as i will mine ; and bolting with me to the end of the earth .
i love you ; i love you ... and i love you .
sandy .
i' m sorry to have been so long , sandy .
seems they' ve been in here too .
anything missing in the bedroom ?
her laptop' s gone and her disks and all her files .
yes .
it' s a mess .
what' s in that ?
oh , uh , her will , amongst other things .
oh .
seems she wanted to be buried in africa .
oh .
darling tessa .
hmm .
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
what are you doing ?
could someone please explain what they' re doing , please ?
look , justin , it it' s just concrete .
it' s to keep the grave robbers out .
tessa expressed a wish to lie ... in african soil , not in bloody concrete .
nothing can grow in concrete .
kindly tell them to leave , please , ghita .
and you too , please , gentlemen .
thank you .
it was kind of you to come .
hello .
kioko .

listen , you know you know that i' m here for you , don' t you ?
yes , i do .
thank you , ghita .
you' re a good friend .
i , uh i' m afraid i wanted to ask you a question .
rather a delicate question .
l well , maybe it' s indelicate .
um anything .
what do you think that arnold and tessa were doing at lake turkana ?
oh , i see .
you know , they did spend enough time together to give everyone the impression that they were
come on ; justin .
you know what this place is like .
if you can' t have sex , you have other people' s sex real or imagined .
who' s this ?
it' s claude .
arnold' s boyfriend .
i' d never have guessed .
it' s illegal here .
you don' t shout about it .
ah , well .
wish she could' ve told me .
perhaps she didn' t think you needed to know .
tessa quayle i have ; but i have no wanza kilulu .
are you sure that is the right name ?
uh , yes , wanza kilulu , and , uh , there was a white doctor attending to her , and he was there when she died .
perhaps he conducted the postmortem .
maybe you have a record of the postmortem .
if i have no patient' s record , how can i have a postmortem record ?
and we don' t have european doctors working here .
right , but her name is definitely wanza kilulu , and i remember that she was well , if she does not appear in my records here
i' m sorry .
she does not i don' t think she was yes .
no , i understand .
i mean , i' m not mad here .
she was in the bed .
okay , fine , yeah .
i' m sorry .
you want money ?
fifty .
fifty .
fifty .
sorry .
he helped my wife , and i' m trying to find him .
i think he lives here , but i have no idea where he is .
it' s a family .
you don' t know him ?
kioko kilulu .
kioko kilulu ?
yes , a name .
do you know ?
who is it ?
who is it ?
it' s a family , from here .
a girl ?
he' s a young boy ; about 12 .
no ?
kioko ?
kioko , hello .
hello .
do do you remember me ?
i' ve been looking for you .
no trouble .
you' re not in trouble .
i just want to talk to you .
is this the clinic where wanza was treated ?
i cannot help you without
next .
can i help you ?
why why was that lady turned away ?
she refuses treatment .
but she seemed to want to have treatment .
she' s a t. b. patient who discontinued her treatment .
her card was canceled .
isn' t that all the more reason to inoculate her child ?
this is diphtheria vaccine .
what is your business here ; please ?
my name is quayle .
i' m from the british high commission .
do you see any of your countrymen here , mr. quayle ?
uh , excuse me one may i see your card , kioko ?
i see .
this is in wanza' s name .
that' s the family it' s a family medical card , right ?
yes .
and what does " i. c. " mean ?
it means informed consent .
it means they consented to treatment and have family medical entitlement .
and that treatment is dypraxa ?
but if they don' t give consent , then they lose the right to medical care ?
it' s not much of a choice ; is it ?
i suppose they' re not even informed that they' re testing a new drug ?
i don' t make the rules ; mr. quayle .
mr. quayle ?
yes ?
will you please come with us ?
kioko , there' s your card .
thank you .
why is the child being questioned ?
it' s okay .
why did you come to talk to this boy ?
he attended my wife' s funeral , so i came to thank him .
for a diplomat , you' re not a very good liar .
well , i haven' t risen very high .
we know about your wife ; mr. quayle .
he was her lover this , uh , bluhm .
so people are pleased to tell me .
these men you hired to kill them
they rape and kill her , and they let him go .
where did you find them ?
well , perhaps i asked a policeman .
can you tell me what i' m doing here , please ?
we' ve been asked to ... keep you here .
right .
help us help you .
i' m sorry .
could you explain ?
i have not acquired a taste for kenyan tea , i' m afraid .
look , we' re trying to help you .
you help us , we help you .
if you give us something small , we can always say we didn' t find you .
don' t you believe i have the power to let you go ?
can i help you ?
yes .
my name is woodrow , acting head of mission for her majesty' s government .
this is detective inspector deasey of scotland yard .
mr. deasey will be inquiring into the death of mr. quayle' s wife .
if you have any questions , ask them of him .
is that clear ?
you weren' t mistreated ?
no .
you know whose territory you are in ; mr. what did you say your name was ?
and your name is ?
right .
the , uh the boy kioko who i came to see
what have you done with him ?
he ran away .
i hope nothing' s happened to him .
where' s your car , justin ?
it' s near the market .
is that the official thinking then that arnold killed tessa ?
i' m afraid that' s looking likely .
do you think that he was her lover ?
i' m afraid that' s looking likely too .
what were they doing up at lake turkana ?
romantic setting .
sorry to have to say it , old chap .
but why suspect bluhm then ?
i mean , there may have been others other lovers .
if she was an unfaithful wife ; why stop at arnold ?
i wouldn' t listen to rumor , unless you' ve evidence ?
yes , evidence .
that' s always the problem .
justin ; be a good chap and leave this to us .
there are proper channels for these things .
ghita ; hi .
thanks for coming .
so why did you want to meet here ?
something that we shouldn' t be seen talking about ?
dypraxa .
i know that tessa and arnold wrote a report on the threebees trials , and i need to know what happened to it .
what makes you think i know ?
because they trusted you , and so do i.
help me , please , ghita .
all i know is that tessa gave sandy a copy .
sandy ?
why him ?
sandy was a compromise semiofficial .
arnold wanted to go public with it .
tessa wouldn' t .
because ?
because she wanted to do it your way , through channels .
but , justin , i wouldn' t bother looking for it .
if it threatens british commercial interests , it would' ve been shredded .
she could' ve brought it to me .
she didn' t want to get you involved .
why ?
ghita , why didn' t she want me involved ?
to protect you .
do you know if she showed the report to anyone else ?
kenny curtiss .
time of the month , kenny ?
fuck off .
might help if you took the fucking flag out .
well , get closer to the fucking hole , and maybe i will .
interesting man you got there , crick .
must be the only white caddy in africa .
look , kdh are waiting for me to default on my dypraxa commitments , and i have a cash flow problem .
what are you lot going to do about it ?
we never promised to protect you commercially .
you protect me ?
that' s fucking rich .
a word or two from me in the right black ear , a couple of cases of krug , and you' d be on the next plane back home .
i mean , i spend more money on champagne in a year than your shop' s annual fucking budget .
oh , there you go cause of your cash flow problem .
you' re in my eyeline , old chap .
you' re what passes forjames bond around here .
get her majesty' s secret service to pull a few strings .
it' s what you spies do , isn' t it ?
is it ?
never really sure what it is we do .
don' t even think about bullying me , old man .
i' m not a member of your gentlemen' s club .
i don' t have to play by the rules .
so it seems .
call that one in , shall we ?
mr. curtiss , i' m sorry to disturb your game .
my name is justin quayle from the high commission .
i believe you knew my wife , tessa .
justin .
didn' t know you were a member here .
yes , i met her at one of your parties .
she came to see you , i think .
she gave you a report that she had written on dypraxa .
justin , i really don' t think this is the time or the place
i hope you didn' t find her too troublesome , because she could be a terrier when she had a scent .
huh , sounds like you' re describing a bitch .
i' m sorry about your loss , but i don' t remember being given any report .
well , that' s odd , because she noted it in her diary .
then you know more than i do .
didn' t know ; uh didn' t know tessa kept a diary .
well , i think tessa was right then , tim .
you don' t know everything .
i know where you' re going on tuesday .
next , please .
sorry about the weather .
it' s hardly your fault .
oh , dear .
we' ve had some forgeries on the diplomatics .
i' m gonna have to keep this , i' m afraid , sir .
what ?
the f. c. o. will issue you with a new one in a few days .
what if i want to travel with it ?
just two , three days at the most .
are you saying that' s a forgery ?
it does happen ; sir ; even on diplomatics .
but that was issued to me a year ago by the diplomatic office sir , the f. c. o. will take care of that .
it' s just here on the right .
good afternoon , sir .
good afternoon .
let me take that for you .
oh , i' d rather keep it with me .
uh ; club rule ; justin .
i' m sorry .
no no luggage in the , uh in the dining room .
could you just tuck it into your cubbyhole , please , jimmy ?
thank you .
certainly , sir .
thank you , sir .
my dear fellow , what a dreadful time you' ve had .
welcome home .
thank you , bernard .
any , uh , plans , or is it too soon ?
plans ?
well , holiday , visiting friends , the million things you' ve always wanted to do in the garden .
mmm .
you' re on indefinite sick leave .
enjoy it .
i hear the , uh the snow' s very good at chamonix .
i don' t have a passport , bernard .
they took mine at the airport .
oh , of course , yes .
you missed the , um you missed the recall .
mmm .
the sole meunire' s not bad here , if if you like sole .
otherwise have it grilled .
grilled' il be fine .
um , no starters , i think .
you' ve been cleared , by the way .
thought we' d get that bit of unpleasantness dealt with first .
cleared for what ?
um , of what .
uh , murder most foul .
seems you didn' t hire contract killers in a den of vice after all .
deasey is satisfied it was a crime of passion by our dark medical horse .
it' s just a question now of finding bluhm .
arnold bluhm is gay , bernard .
gay men don' t rape their women friends .
well , i' ve known one or two very savage queens in my time .
do you no good to go poking around under rocks , justin .
some very nasty things live under rocks ; especially in foreign gardens .
advice of a friend .
what is it that i' m not to look into , bernard ?
quayles have always made reliable foreign service men .
shouldn' t be surprised if you' ve still got a small head of mission in your knapsack .
challenging post .
more challenging than dealing with kenny curtiss ?
he' s a crude sort of chap , our kenny , but he flies the flag for us .
he got up dear tessa' s nose , i fear .
yes , she wrote a report about it .
about kenny ?
no , about dypraxa .
ah ; that .
she expected some action to be taken , but none was , was it ?
she tell you about the letter , or did you find it among her things ?
tucked into her diary ; perhaps ?
what letter is that , bernard ?
ramblings of an aging fart .
senility setting in early , alas .
naughty of her to take it though .
very naughty indeed .
yes , i found that .
be grateful to have it back .
written under stress , you understand .
regrettable things said .
wouldn' t want it falling into the wrong hands .
sorry , bernard .
are we talking about the same letter ?
what' s yours about ?
undying love .
ah .
what' s yours ?
they' re not so good grilled .
you should' ve had the meunire .
ladies and gentlemen
ladies and gentlemen ; please keep all your belongings with you at all times .
it' s good to see you , ham .
sorry about the blubbing .
it' s those bloody latin genes , you know .
it' s the same old ham .
oh , no .
no , not anymore .
god , i loved her rotten .
and she loved you rotten .
first cousins can be closer than siblings .
i still don' t understand why i let you talk me out of going to the funeral .
it was the wrong crowd for you , ham .
we' il have a private memorial service here .
you can blub all your way through it .
don' t think i won' t .
hire the abbey .
you can afford it now .
can i ?
tess left you bloody well off .
want to know what you' re worth ?
not particularly .
oh , i' ve got the keys to the chelsea house .
thought you might want to stay there while you' re in london .
no , i' d rather not .
well , it' s all yours .
that and her african women' s charity .
said it would get you out of the garden .
when did she say that ?
two weeks before she died .
look , i am ravenous .
have you had lunch ?
yes , i have .
a very civilized lunch with bernard pellegrin ... who expressed an interest in tessa' s diary .
but tess never kept a diary .
she hated the things .
you and i know that .
pellegrin must have been disinformed .
tess thought she was being watched .
didn' t stop her e mailing twice a day .
more inquiries than google .
look at him .
the boy is two thirds machine .
i' m telling you ; it' s scary .
mind of a computer .
appetite of a waste disposal .
and what' s the other third ?
oh , manzini , unquestionably .
those e mails from tess guido helped me with them .
company stuff .
boring .
mm .
ownership , franchises , that sort of thing .
i' m trying to find out who brokered the marriage .
what marriage ?
kdh and threebees .
kdh make dypraxa .
threebees test it .
it' s a marriage of convenience , of course .
both in it for what they can get out of it .
that phrase about the marriage is that tess' s phrase or yours ?
oh , hers .
hers .
producing dead offspring .
oh , this is so good !
why don' t you try some .
it looks disgusting .
i can get that stuff through her mirror server .
well , how do you do that ?
all you need is the password .
duh .
yeah , but i don' t have her password .
come on , jus .
five letters .
three guesses .
i have no idea .
my name guido .
she used the one for the " l " and the zero for the " o.
i set it up for her .
wait , wait .
give him a chance to read it .
lightning tour .
i' m printing as i go .
what' s hippo ?
oh ; i know that one .
german german pharma watch .
keep an eye on what the drug companies are up to .
copy that .
kdh .
can we open that ?
sure .
no problem .
a new plague is sweeping the world .
in the 21 st century , multi resistant t. b. will kill one in three .
but now there is hope .
it' s huge , isn' t it ?
kdh is developing a revolutionary treatment for t. b. sufferers .
it' s global .
we call it dypraxa .
you will call it life .
and i call it a blockbuster .
karel delacourt hudson .
the world is our clinic .
it' s gonna sell like hotcakes .
can you magnify that photograph ?
magnify it ?
he can send it out for doughnuts .
is it possible to zoom in on it ?
yeah , sure .
it' s pellegrin .
why is he there ?
