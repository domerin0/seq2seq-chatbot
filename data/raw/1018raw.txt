you left me all by myself in that test tube ... without a card or a letter , and now i want a divorce .
and this is a community property state , so i want my share .

the youth formula we invented !
you mean , the youth formula that i invented .
oh , no way , buddy , no way .
who you grounding , fat boy ?
you grounding me ?
lhaven' t grounded
i was hoping we could do this like gentlemen .
come on , sherman .
you' re gonna make me do something nasty to you , sherman .

what does this say ?
phleer pharmaceuticals . " $1 50 mill $1 50 million .
i think buddy' s going shopping .
professor , i got here as fast as i could .
i' ve got to hide this formula before buddy gets to it .
goodidea .
i found something i thinkyou should look at .
when i left here last night , everthing was fii ne .
i mean , this was not here .
good lord .
buddy must' ve recombined from the genomic sequence i extracted .
this doesn' t make any sense .
he' sjust a fragment of genetic information .
he' s nothing without a strand of dna to graft himselfonto .
where where did he get it ?
mm .
just a second here .
buster !
thankyou so much .
leanne guilford .
president ofacquisitions .
buddy love , president of love industries .
allergies ?
no .
do you have a dog ?
yes , i do a yorkie .
oh .
she' s driving me crazy right now .
bitch .
excuse me .
it' s a female dog that you have , and she' s in heat , right ?
yes .
how did you know that ?
let' sjust say i have a sixth sense about those things .
is this her ?
yeah , little courtney .
ooh , nasty .
mr. love , maybe we' d better do this another time .
no , this is the perfect time .
let' s do this right now .
this is the perfect time to talk about my youth formula .
we are already committed to purchasing professor klump' s formula .
oh , professor klump' s formula ?
that' s if it works .
let' sjust that although he' s a brilliant scientist , at times , he can be unstable .
yes .
huh .
interesting .
yes , now , my formula works ... and can be yours for the price of $1 49 million , ifyou act now , pretty lady .
forgive me for being blunt , but you don' t expect me tojust take your word for it , do you ?
oh , no , not at all .
just say when , and i' il make it available to you .
all right .
if klump can' t deliver and you can prove your formula' s better , yes ?
phleer would have to seriously consider it .
is that right ?
i' ve got to go to a meeting .
can we reschedule for later ?
we certainly can .
good .
how about wednesday , 7 : 00 ?
perfect .
wednesday at 7 : 00 .

stufflike that .
right , right , precisely .
ver good .
but what about random nucleotide polymorphisms , professor ?
excellent question .
random nucleotide polymorphisms
random nucleotide polymorphisms
random nucleotide [ clears throat ]
i ain' t got a clue .

jason , yes , please , come in .
look , lknowyou think you' re feeling fine , but lran some more tests anyway .
really ?
yeah .
whenyou extractedbuddy , somehow it altered the gene that regulates neurotransmitter activity to the cerebral cortex .
uh, jason , all these big words are really perplexing to me .
can you talk in plain english ?
you' re losing your intelligence , sir .
yeah .
yeah , i know .
i know .
i can feel it .

the other day , i got out the shower , and i bent down to reach for a towel , and i felt a sharp pain in my chest .
shot through my chest and up around my back , down my spine .
i thought , " oh , lord .
i thought i was dying .

clesius !
oh , look whatyou' ve done !
oh .
ah  you girls are crazy .
i' m leaving .
oh , clesius , clesius , wait !
clesius !
oh , clesius !
i don' t believe it .
clesius , i only told her ' cause she got so much experience in sexual matters .
i ain' t nothing but a big damn joke to you , ain' t i ?

her husband ain' t nothing but a big ol ' pile ofworthless crap !
clesius !
clesius !
oh . [ classical ]
i' m just glad they' re back in town so you can fii nally meet them .
i' m extremely nervous because i really want to make a good impression .
sherman , there' s no reason foryou to be nervous .
my parents are ver down to earth people , and they' re gonna love you .
i guess it' s not like they' re rocket scientists .
well , actually , they are .
daddy !

i' m gonna show all of' em .
screw the golden years .
and here' s to youth !
that' s some nasty mess .
i don' t feel no [ gagging ]
damn , that was some nasty stuff !
oh , i feel as strange as hell .
oh !
hey , get your ass
who the hell are you ?
who you put
it worked .
it worked !
papa' sgot a brand newbag [ continues ]
yeah !
oh , what a beautiful bird .
oh , crackers has been in our family more than 50 years .
hmm ?
fifty years .
he' s older than i am .
sherman , your fly .
your fly .
yeah , he can fly all over .
no , no , no , zip your pants .
oh , my goodness .
excuse me .
i felt i felt a little breeze .
so , uh , genomic extractions .
fascinating .
but the whole concept ofremoving faultygenes must haveyou in an ethicalquandary . .
e excuse me .
ethical ?
oh , yes , ldon' t knowmuch about " ethicals " , to be perfectly honest withyou .
but the " quandar " i don' t like thejapanese cars .
ldon' t like the ethicalquandary .
i' m a volvo man myself .
well , yeah .
oh !
sherman is known as the leading expert in genomic extractions .
give us a littlepreviewof thespeechyou' re going to make at thepress conference .
say what now ?
lknow we wouldnever be able to keep up , but is there some way thatyou could explain it in layman terms ?
oh , you' d like me to explain to you ?
yes .
well , i would love to .
i would be honored .
it' s really quite simple .
this corn , for instance
this piece ofcorn here can represent a strand of dna .
andthese little the individual the bumpy things that go
the green giant calls them " niblets .
uh , niblets .
these niblets represent eachgene , andthey determine everything aboutyou .
for instance , mrs. gaines , let' s say ifa person was to have big titties , like you .
sherman !
i' m sorry .
big titties .
no , breasts .
scratch it .
get offyou .
on me .
now , i have a big ass .
never mind that .
what we' re attempting to do here is to extract the , uh , the bad , badgenes .
extract that titty out .
andass comes out .
andjust leave thegoodgenes , which is ver simple ifyou think about it .
just ignore that .
please ignore those .
those are the badgenes .
what i' m really tring to do is go deep , deep down into the gene structure , which oftentimes is much more difficult .
crackers !
oh , goodness !
i' m i' m so so sorr about that .
my pants got caught in the thing and they pulled it on out .
his wings is twitching a little bit , so he' s allright .
buddy love .
mr. love .
leanne guilford .
yes , miss guilford .
how are you ?
