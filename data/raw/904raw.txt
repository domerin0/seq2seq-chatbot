about a seven .
below zero .
i think i know just what you need .
dinner .
dinner ?
yes , dinner .
we need watson for this investigation , eddie .
he' s stubborn , but if we can catch him off guard ... ... maybe loosen him up , i think we can work it out .
i' il just be myself .
one more thing .
watson' s family ... ... they don' t know that he' s an lnterpol agent .
what do they think he is ?
a librarian .
a librarian ?
yes .

if you say so .
what kind of music you like ?
okay , okay , okay .

he' il be coming into the docks .
a boat !
look , just let me out of here !
do you know how long i' ve been waiting here for you ?
what' s the matter ?
you sound like an obscene phone call .
you' re out of shape .
you should keep fit .
right , but let' s not waste any more time , shall we ?
pier 5 .
well , that must be the ship , if giscard' s telling the truth .
let' s hope so .

my nose isn' t that big .
it' s really me .

don' t you think i recognize my own thing ?
it' s cold in here .
let me take a look .
what' s happening to me ?
all right .
let' s just ... ... stay calm .
i' m sure there' s a perfectly rational explanation for this .
think back .
you were on the boat , in the container .
what happened ?
lights everywhere .
the boy .
the boy ?
medallion .
yes .
i have it .
it was in your pocket .
what' s this ?
wow .
where did you go ?
excuse me , nurse .
we' re from lnterpol .
would you mind if we have a few moments with the boy ?
you know , the man outside says you' re not eating .
you should eat to gain strength .
how are you feeling ?
feeling .
feel .
feeling .
bit bumpy out there on the ocean waves ?
bit rough ?
out there ?
out there on the high seas ?
bumpity bumpity ?
excuse me .

watson , are you there ?
i' m not here .
what happened ?
snakehead' s men .
they were here for the boy .
i' m gonna keep him with me .
good idea .
keep him safe .
yes .
yes .
watson , you did all this alone ?
no , eddie is
i mean , i think i mentioned that eddie wasn' t the only one with a black belt .
so you' re all right ?
perfect .
great .
okay .
i' il see you back at the
yeah .
i' m gonna do a couple of press ups and meet you back there .
yes .
yes .
you just take care of the boy .
eddie , listen  watson , something wrong .
snakehead' s men got away again , but at least the boy is safe .
i mean , something wrong with me .
hit me .
what ?
go on , hit me .
no , i can' t do that .
it' s okay , i don' t mind .
well , i mind .
i mean
a chap could break a finger , you know .
okay .
use this .
no , thanks .
i went before i came out .
no , hit me with this .
for real ?
yes .
god .
there you go .
all right ?
harder .
i can' t do this .
this is ridiculous .
the queen hits harder than that .
how
how dare you .
oh , my god .
are you all right ?
oh , god .
i' m so sorry , my friend .
did it hurt ?
of course it hurt .
but nothing .
i was shot before ... ... but i was okay .
shoot me .
go ahead .
no , i think the embalming fluid has gone to your head .
this is ridiculous .
give me the gun .
absolutely not .
i' il show you .
you know how many forms i have to fill out if i fire my gun ?
absolutely not .
this is how accidents happen .
look .
amazing .
no blood .
amazing .
incredible .
see ?
i mean , still ....
that' s incredible .
i mean , just ....
stop that .
i' m sorry .
that was below the belt .
i' m sorry .
that' s what i mean .
can one of you explain this latest failure ?
why you couldn' t retrieve one small boy ?
sir ... ... this might sound crazy ... ... but i emptied a whole clip into that chinese cop and he still wouldn' t die .
what chinese cop ?
that' s eddie yang .
he' s supposed to have died yesterday , drowned in that container .
then it' s true .
professor .
doctor .
doctor .
professor .
doctor .
doctor .
thank you for being here .
we' ve come across something very interesting .
have you ever seen this before ?
doesn' t ring a bell .
doctor ?
i' ve seen that before .
the fish is the sign of life .
that' s interesting .
and the snake is the sign of  whoa .
the medallion .
you' re gonna love this .
now , it should have a serpent on one side .
and a fish on the other .
if what you have is real , that is the holy grail of eastern mythology .
and maybe the secret to eternal life .
sweet !
where' d you get the medallion ?
i recognize the fish .
you got it from a kid , didn' t you ?
y es .
the legend says every thousand years ... ... a child is chosen that can bind the halves together ... ... and restore life to the dead .
you get that kid and the medallion ...
... you' re a god .
that' s nonsense .
so where' s the other half ?
wait !
the ancient texts say that if you want superhuman strength ... ... and immortality , you need both halves .
the only documented case of a genuine resurrection ....
you can' t weigh it , measure it , smoke it .
look , ancient texts aren' t fairy tales .
thank you , professor .
doctor .
doctor .
cheerio , for now .
good luck .
why would a young boy have something like this ?
this snakehead chap , is he after the medallion or the boy ?
by the way , take good care of that kid .
the medallion can not only give life , it can take it away .
okay , i' il cover the front door , call in for backup .
you go to the rear to nicole' s apartment as fast as you can .
got it .
sorry .
you know , for a little person , you sure do eat a lot .
still going ?
what did you have ?
okay .
here we go .
try that .
that good ?
you don' t like ....
you' re not ....
one of my culinary skills ... ... other than peeling fruit , of course ... ... just so happens to be a toasted ... ... peanut butter and jelly sandwich ... ... which , i might add , eddie could eat for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
then again , he didn' t really have any choice .
why ?
because i can' t cook anything else .
i just can' t believe that he' s really gone .
he' s not gone .
jai ... ... do you not understand that eddie' s not coming back ?
i pulled him back .
okay ....
jai , eddie' s ....
he
just hold on .
see ?
oh , my god .
eddie ?
eddie .
jai !
no !
eddie !
you see ?
i told you he wasn' t dead .
the boy , sir .
yes .
welcome ... ... my old friend .
so ... ... a quick , painless death ... ... followed by resurrection ... ... immortality ... ... and powers beyond your dreams .
are you sure ?
his order is ruled by reverence for life .
my death before him must be reversed .
and if it isn' t ... ... kill him .
and then who would bring you back , chosen one ?
pitiful mortal .
so ... ... i have no further use for you , chosen one .
you' re not immortal .
what ?
to become immortal , you need both halves of the medallion .
where' s the other half ?
tell me !
nicole .
eddie .
it' s me .
i' m fine , really .
i just ....
i still don' t understand , eddie , because i was there ...
... and i saw you , and  nicole , it' s me .
you see , it' s just that i was at the container and you were dead .
i mean , you were dead .
nicole , the boy uses the medallion to give life .
that' s why snakehead took him .
with the boy and the medallion , he could ....
he could become like you ?
yes , but he needs the whole medallion ... ... and he only has half .
look ... ... this is a touching reunion .
we' re all glad that eddie' s amongst the living ... ... but we still haven' t found snakehead' s helicopter .
get online .
find anything that was in the air in the last hour .
i don' t care if it was a bird , a plane or bloody superman .
no offense , old chap .
eddie .
if he needs the other half , he' s gonna come looking for you .
if he is looking for me ... ... he' il be looking for my partner .
me ?
my family .
my family .
cool .
see , that' s not normal .
i mean , that' s not natural .
what ?
eddie , take my bike !
thank god .
they' re all right .
charlotte ?
charlotte ?
i have something i have to tell you .
yes , dear ?
eddie ....
watson !
they' re here !
go !
go !
charlotte , where are you going ?
this is no time for cleaning .
take your shield !
watson !
are you all right , love ?
yes , i' m fine , dear .
catch !
here .
i' il lead them away .
your wife ?
what the ?
there you are .
quick .
quick .
that' s a good boy .
now , listen .
guns are very dangerous things , all right ?
right .
how dare you shoot ... ... at my ... ... wife !
my lord .
where' d he go ?
we meet again ... ... eddie yang .
where' s the boy ?
my guest is no concern of yours .
all that matters is that you have the other half of the medallion .
don' t run , eddie !
you can' t hide from me !
the medallion is mine !
you think it' s a game ?
well , let' s play !
we' re the same , you and l .
what a pity .
what a waste .
you don' t know what powers you have .
destiny calls .
he' s sleeping .
at least , i think that' s what he' s doing .
he doesn' t even look like he' s breathing .
the boy !
oh , god , i wish you wouldn' t do that .
eddie , you' re all right .
the boy' s in danger .
he' s going to kill him .
right ? !
snakehead has taken the boy to raven' s keep .
i told you everything i know .
i did .
we need to move fast .
of course i can fly this thing .
i built it myself .
you take the bike .
i' il guide you from the air .
i' m driving .
that' s raven' s keep .
it' s five miles away .
you should wash your hands .
come on .
nicole .
be careful .
you too .
what the hell are you doing here ?
where' s the boy ?
let' s get out of here !
move !
you cowards !
watson .
watson !
are you crazy ?
be careful .

jai , thank god .
you' re in danger .
it' s over .
you' re safe now .
i don' t think so .
no , it' s all right .
run !
for your lives .
it' s not nice to take things that don' t belong to you .
fetch .
my brother ... ... don' t be sentimental .
it' s so unnecessary .
it' s so human .
so normal .
you and i will live forever .
we are the lords of time .
we can take whatever we choose .
i mean , what difference can a single human life like hers make to us ?
we are immortal .
let me show you .
eddie , use the medallion to end the life that it gave .
can you ?
it' s your turn .
what' s that for ?
that , eddie yang , is for not catching me .
and that , eddie yang , is for not catching me .
interpol !
freeze !
isn' t that lovely ?
of course ... ... when he came back , he was naked .
i mean , completely starkers .
not a stitch .
i' m not complaining , mind you .
listen , i have this cough .
i think it' s quite serious .
honestly , i could snuff at any point .
i don' t suppose you' d consider a rub on your medallion ?
i really am .
hello ?

that' s all .
oh , the medallion .
