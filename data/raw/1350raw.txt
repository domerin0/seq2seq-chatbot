think to yourself that every day is your last .
## [ piano playing softly ]
the hour to which you do not look forward ... will come as a welcome surprise .
as for me , when you want a good laugh , you will find me in fine state fat and sleek , [ wine pouring ]
a true hog of epicurus' s herd .
and we find you cribbing lines from horace as well .
well done , john .
i must say , hannibal , speaking for the rest of the herd
i' m sorry .
for the symphony board .
oh .
these little soirees of yours are always the highlight of our year .
just so .
yes .
you' re too kind .
i do feel a bit guiltyenjoying such a lovely evening ... when one of our musicians is still listed as a " missing person .
yes .
poor fellow .
shall i confess something wicked ?
i can' t help feeling just the tiniest bit , well , relieved .
it sounds awful , i know , but
iet' s face it so does the man' s playing .
hannibal , confess .
what is this divine looking amuse bouche ?
ifl tell you ,
i' m afraid you won' t even try it .
so , bon appetit .
bon appetit .
mmm .
special agent graham .
what an unexpected pleasure .
i' m sorry to bother you again , dr. lecter .
i know it' s very late .
there' s no bother .
we' re both night owls , i think .
come in , please .
thank you .
let me take your coat .
so , what' s on your mind ?
we' ve been on the wrong track this whole time , doctor , you and i.
our whole profile' s wrong .
we' ve been looking for someone with a crazy grudge ... and some kind of anatomical knowledge .
decertified doctors , med school dropouts , laid off mortuary workers .
from the precision of the cuts , yes , and his choice of souvenirs .
that' s where we' re off target .
he' s not collecting body parts .
then why keep them ? .
he' s not keeping them .
he' s eating them .
no , listen .
we were at molly' s parents for new year' s , and molly' s dad was showing my son , josh , how to carve a roasted chicken .
yeah ? .
he said , " the tender est part of the chicken ... is the oysters here on either side of the back .
i had never heard that expression before " oysters .
then suddenly , i had a flash of the third victim .
darcy taylor she was missing flesh from her back .
and then it hit me liver , kidney , tongue , thymus .
every single victim lost some body part used in cooking .
have you shared this with the bureau ? .
no .
i i needed to see you first , but i' m right .
i know i' m right .
i' m i' m starting to be able to think like this one .
yeah , that' s fascinating .
you know , i' d always suspected as much .
you are an eidetiker .
i' m i' m not psychic , doctor .
no , no , no .
this is different , more akin to artistic imagination .
you' re able to assume the emotional point of view of other people , even those that might scare or sicken you .
it' s a troubling gift , i should think .
how i' d love to get you on my couch .
something still doesn' t make sense to me .
you' re the best forensic psychiatrist i know .
and somehow , in all our time together , this possibility never occurred toyou .
well , i am only human , will .
perhaps i have made a mistake .
you don' t strike me as a man who makes very many mistakes .
now i' m starting to think that i might no longer enjoy your full confidence .
no , no .
i did i didn' t say that .
i didn' t
i don' t i don' t know what i' m saying .
i' m very , very tired .
i i almost had it .
it' il come to you .
look , why don' t you come back in the morning ?
i' il clear some time on my schedule .
then we can get started on revising our profile .
sound good ?
yeah .
you rest here , and i' il get your coat .
won' t be a tick .
shh .
don' t move .
you' re in shock now .
i don' t want you to feel any pain .
in a moment , you' il begin to be lightheaded , then drowsy .
don' t resist .
it' s so gentle , like slipping into a warm bath .
shh .
i regret it came to this , will .
but every game must have its ending .
shh .
remarkable boy .
i do admire your courage .
oh !
i think i' il eat your heart .
oh !
oh !
hey , dad .
someone' s here .
hey .
you' ve got a beautiful setup here , will .
yeah .
it' s good .
you know why i ' m here ? .
yeah .
i can guess .
how much do you know ? .
just what was in the miami herald and the times .
two families killed a month apart in their homes .
birmingham and atlanta .
circumstances were similar .
not similar .
the same .
what have you kept out of the papers ? .
he smashes mirrors and uses the pieces .
wears latex gloves , so we' ve got no prints .
size 1 1 shoe .
he' s not too comfortable with locks .
pried open a patio door in birmingham .
used a glass cutter in atlanta .
oh , and his blood' s ab positive .
somebody hurt him ? .
nope .
we typed him from semen and saliva .
he' s a secretor .
tell me something , will .
you knew what this was .
did you ever consider picking up the phone and maybe giving me a call ? .
you' ve got all the people you need .
you' ve got dortmund up at harvard .
you' ve got bloom in chicago .
and i' ve got you down here fixing fuckin ' boat motors .
yeah .
i like fixing boat motors .
i wouldn' t be very useful to you anyway .
i don' t think about this stuff anymore .
really ? .
last two we had , you caught .
by doing the same things you and the other guys are doing .
that' s not entirely true .
it' s the way you think .
come on .
there' s been a lot of bullshit about the way i think .
i' ve got technicians that can examine evidence , but you' ve got that other thing .
imagination , projection , whatever .
yeah .
i know you don' t like that part of it .
you wouldn' t like it either .
this freak killed the jacobis in birmingham on saturday night , february 25 .
full moon .
he killed the leeds family in atlanta a few nights ago .
march 28 .
that' s one day short of a lunar month .
if we' re lucky , we may have a little over three weeks before he does it again .
will , do you respect my judgment ? .
yeah , of course .
i think we have a better chance to catch him fast if you help .
go to atlanta and look .
just look .
then help me brief the locals .
that' s it .
crawford has the whole damn government .
what does he need you for ?
he just wants me to look at some evidence , molly , give him another point of view .
it' s it' s a few days a week maybe and i' il be right back .
and you believe that ? .
yes .
i mean look it , these kinds of cases come along very rarely .
and i' ve had experience .
yes , you have .
you' re paid up , will .
all of us , even josh .
there' s a chance that i can help them save some lives .
how do i say no to that ? .
this one
this one will never see me or know my name .
i' il just help them find him .
the cops will have to take him down , not me .
i' il be in the back of the pack , molly .
i promise .
never in your life .
i know you .
come on .
come here .
come here .
i love you .
see you in a few days .
okay .
i' il call you tonight .
bye , dad .
where' s the dog ? .
no one heard barking .
there' s nothing about it in the case file .
the intruder enters in the dark and cuts charles leeds' s throat .
he shoots valerie leeds in the stomach as she' s rising , disabling her but not killing her .
he leaves her to watch her husband die ... and turns and goes down the hall .
the children were st
the children were still in their beds when they were shot , which might indicate that he used a silencer .
he dragged the bodies into the master bedroom , but why bother ? .
they were already dead , and none of them got the same ... extra attention as mrs. leeds .
small pieces of mirror were inserted in the orbital sockets of the victims .
this occurred postmortem .
why did you put mirrors in their eyes ? .
the pieces of mirror make their eyes look alive .
he he wanted an audience .
he he wanted them all lined up watching him ... when he when he touched her .
when he touched her .
touch touch
talcum powder .
there was talcum powder .
mrs. leeds had traces of talcum found on her right inner thigh .
a complete search of the home led to no such matching talcum in the house .
you took your gloves off , didn' t you ? .
you son of a bitch .
you took your gloves off .
you touched her with your bare hand , and then you wiped her down .
but when the gloves were off , did you open her eyes ? .
crawford .
hey .
are the leedses ' bodies still at the morgue ? .
yeah .
who do we have down here that' s really good with latent prints ? .
atlanta p. d. , but they' ve already printed the bodies .
not the bodies .
tell them to check the eyes
mrs. leeds' s eyes , even her corneas .
i i think he took his gloves off , jack .
i think he had to touch her .
jesus , will .
gentlemen , ladies .
this is what the subject' s teeth look like .
the impressions came from bite marks on mrs. leeds .
this degree of crookedness ... plus the groove in this central incisor ... makes his bite signature unique .
fuckin ' shark .
knock it off .
we' re grateful for the bureau' s involvement .
they have a great deal of expertise in this area .
in particular , investigator graham does .
isn' t that right , jack ?
yes , sir .
anything you want to add , mr. graham ? .
why don' t you come on up to the front , please ?
mrs. leeds and mrs. jacobi were the primary targets .
the others were killed just to complete his fantasy .
i know that might be hard to accept , given what you saw , but this was not random .
this wasn' t some killing frenzy .
he was never out of control .
these attacks were highly organized , the women carefully chosen .
we don' t know how he' s choosing them or why .
they lived in different states , and they never met .
but there is some connection .
there' s some common factor , and that' s the key .
find out what that is , and we' il save lives .
' cause this one is gonna go on and on ... until we get smart or we get lucky .
he won' t stop .
why not ? .
because it makes him god .
would you give that up ? .
you asked about the dog .
last night , a vet called us .
leeds and his oldest boy brought the dog in the afternoon before they were killed .
hada puncture wound to its abdomen .
vet had to put it down .
was the dog wearing a collar with the leedses ' address on it ? .
no .
did the jacobis in birmingham have a dog ? .
no dog .
they found a litter box in the basement .
cat droppings in it .
no cat .
if the cat was attacked , the jacobis might have buried it .
ask birmingham to check that backyard .
and tell them to use a methane probe .
it' s faster .
yeah .
it' s for you .
crawford .
carl , you' re the light of my life .
would it hold up in court ? .
okay .
great work .
they found a print on mrs. leeds' s left eye partial thumb .
other than that , there' s nothing else that i can tell you .
thank you very much for your time .
i cannot answer any more questions .
will graham .
remember me ? .
freddy lounds .
i covered the lecter case for the tattler .
did the paperback .
yeah , i remember .
when' d they bring you in ? .
what do you got ? .
you think the tooth fairy will be even a bigger story than lecter ? .
he' s already beaten lecter' s score .
hey , hey !
you write lying shit , and the tattler is an ass wipe !
just stay away from me .
get away , lounds .
go on .
how about an exclusive ? .
sorry about that .
that guy snuck into the hospital and took those pictures of me .
remember ? .
with the tubes hanging out of me .
i know .
forget that prick and give yourself some credit .
when we catch the tooth fairy , that print plus his teeth will burn him .
you did that , will .
the evidence was there , jack .
it was right there for anybody to see .
but nobody else did .
all i' m saying is that was very good work .
no .
good work would be seeing it all the way through and catching the guy .
and i can' t do that .
i did what you asked me to do .
i' m going home .
i don' t even have any idea who this guy is .
that that stuff i just gave them was broad strokes .
he' s got no face to me .
that' s what you said about garrett hobbs .
remember ? .
and you figured him out .
no , i didn' t .
you didn' t ? .
no .
i was stuck on hobbs .
yeah ? .
i had help .
from lecter .
yeah .
jack , don' t play games with me , man .
don' t do it .
if there' s something on your mind , come out and say it .
i' m just saying maybe we' ve got a resource we ought to look into .
have you been walking me through the rest of this just so you could ask me that ? .
don' t get mad at me .
i' m just doing my job .
if you know a better shortcut , let me know it .
if you think there' s any chance he' il talk to me , i' il go myself .
if you tell me you can' t handle it , god knows i' d understand that .
as a research subject , lecter has proven most disappointing .
he' s simply impenetrable to psychological testing .
rorschach , thematic apperception [ drawer opens ]
he folds them into origami , as you see .
so you can imagine the stir your little visit is causing among my staff , mr. graham .
if you' d care to share some insights dr. chilton .
i' m sorry .
i' ve got a 4 .. 1 7 flight back to atlanta .
of course .
tell me , when you saw lecter' s murders their style , so to speak were you able perhaps to reconstruct his fantasies ? .
and if so , did you jot down any impressions ? .
no .
let me be frank , mr. graham .
the first definitive analysis of lecter will be a publisher' s wet dream .
i' d give you full credit of course .
oh .
well , damn it , man , you must have some advice .
you caught him .
what was your trick ? .
i let him kill me .
that' s the same atrocious after shave you wore in court .
i keep getting it for christmas .
christmas , yes .
did you get my card ? .
i got it .
thank you .
so nice ofthe bureau' s crime lab to forward that .
they wouldn' t give me your home address .
dr. bloom sent me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of forensic psychiatry .
and ? .
very interesting , even to a layman .
you say you' re a layman ,
but it was you who caught me .
wasn' t it , will ? .
do you know how you did it ?
i got lucky .
i don' t think you believe that .
it' s in the transcript .
what does it matter now ? .
doesn' t matter to me , will .
i need your advice , dr. lecter .
birmingham and atlanta .
you want to know how he' s choosing them , don' t you ? .
i thought you' d have some ideas .
i' m asking you to tell me what they are .
why should i ? .
there are things you don' t have .
research materials , maybe even computer access .
i' d speak to the chief of staff .
ah , yes , dr. chilton .
gruesome , isn' t he ? .
he fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle .
if you recall , will , our last collaboration ended rather messily .
you get to see the file on this case , and there' s another reason .
i' m all ears .
i thought you might enjoy the challenge find out if you' re smarter than the person i' m looking for .
then , by implication , you think you' re smarter than i am , since it was you who caught me .
no .
i know i' m not smarter than you .
then how did you catch me ? .
you had ... disadvantages .
what disadvantages ? .
you' re insane .
you' re very tanned , will .
and your hands are so rough , not like a cop' s hands anymore .
and that shaving lotion is something a child would select .
has a little ship on the bottle , does it not ? .
and how is young josh and the lovely molly ? .
they' re always in my thoughts , you know .
you will not persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity .
i don' t think i' il persuade you at all .
you' il either do it oryou won' t .
is that the case file ? .
yes .
with photos ? .
let me keep them , and i might consider it .
no .
do you dream much , will ? .
good bye , dr. lecter .
you haven' t threatened to take away my books yet .
give me the file then , and i' il tell you what i think .
i need one hour and privacy .
just like old times , hey , will ? .
this is a very shy boy , will .
i' d love to meet him .
have you considered the possibility that he is disfigured ... or that he may believe he is disfigured ? .
the mirrors .
yes .
you notice he smashes all the mirrors in the houses ... and not just enough to get the pieces he wants .
of course , those shards in their eyes so he can see himself there .
that' s interesting .
no , it' s not interesting .
you thought of that before .
i had considered it .
what about the women ? .
uh huh .
dead mere puppets .
you need to see them living , the way they caught his eye .
that' s impossible .
almost , not quite .
what were they ards like ? .
big backyards .
fenced , some hedges .
why ? .
because if this pilgrim feels a special relationship with the moon , he might like to go outside and look at it .
you ever seen blood in the moonlight , will ? .
it appears quite black .
if one were nude , say , it would be better to have outdoor privacy for that sort of thing .
you think they ards might be a factor when he selects victims ? .
oh , yes , and there will be more of them of course victims .
so you' il be wanting lots of these little chin wags , i take it .
i might not have time .
i do .
i have oodles .
i need your opinion now .
then here' s one .
you stink of fear and that cheap lotion .
you stink of fear , will , but you' re not a coward .
you fear me , but still you came here .
you fear this shy boy , yet still you seek him out .
don' t you understand , will ? .
you caught me because we are very much alike .
without our imaginations , we' d be like all those other poor dullards .
fear is the price of our instrument , but i can help you bear it .
you gettin ' his face ? .
yeah .
okay , you got it ? .
all right , let' s get the fuck outta here .
you' re sure you' re okay ?
yeah .
yeah , i' m okay .
what do you think he meant by " see them living " ? .
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
maybe nothing .
it' s hard to separate his bullshit , but i' m gonna make another pass at the leeds house .
## [ honky tonk piano ]
duchess , no .
who' s that ?
get ' em , duchess .
get' em , duch .
go get' em , duch .
go get ' em , girl .
and ... action !
charlie !
how did you
hey !
hey , gang .
he' s a crazy man .
how is everybody doin ' ?
oh , just fine .
home from the store .
hi , daddy .
that' s my girl .
hi , daddy .
hi , honey .
billy .
hi , dad .
and , sweetie .
i am not ready for my close up , mr. de mille .
well , what do you think ? .
get close .
get closer .
a little closer .
i think maybe we' d better put these kids to bed a little early tonight .
they seem tired .
don' t you think ?
here we are at the pool party .
what are you doin ' ? .
stop it .
you stop it .
i ' m telling my mother on you .
now i get my kiss .
you want a kiss ? .
i want a kiss the big , romantic kind .
won' t no body get in through here again .
i' il " guaran damn tee " it .
why didn' t he break in down there ? .
it' s more hidden .
hell , that door' s got dead bolts .
reckon he was in too big a hurry .
no .
this one doesn' t hurry .
you sat right here , didn' t you ? .
you watched the children bury the cat .
then you waited for dark .
you' re proud .
you had to sign your work .
grandma .
grandma ?
i' m sorry .
oh , francis !
i' ve never seen a child as dirty and disgusting as you .
look atyou !
you' re soaking wet .
get out ofmy bed !
no !
go back up to your room .
grandma , you' re hurt in ' me .
shut up , you filthy little beast !
i should' ve put you in an orphanage , grandson or not .
you hurting me !
into the bathroom .
take off your nightshirt and wipe your self off .
hurry up !
now give me my scissors from the medicine chest .
please , no !
take that filthy thing in your hand and stretch it out .
no , grandma .
please !
now !
look down .
do you want me to cut it off ?
do you ?
no , grandma !
i pledge you my word , francis .
if you ever make your bed dirty again , i' il cut it off .
you understand ?
i ' i i be ... good boy .
i ' i i be ... good boy .
i promise .
good morning , will .
so nice of you to visit again .
he carved this on a tree near the jacobi house ... with a buck knife .
the same one later used on charles leeds .
yes .
yeah .
take a walk with me .
he had a second tool too , a bolt cutter .
he used that to clear his view .
but ? .
but i don' t think that' s what he brought it for .
too heavy , too awkward and he had to carry it a long way .
and what do we make of that symbol ? .
asian studies at langley identified it as a chinese character .
it appears on a mah jongg piece .
it marks the red dragon .
red dragon .
correct .
this boy begins to interest me .
doctor , we don' t know what greater meaning this symbol might
do you like my little exercise cage , will ? .
my so called lawyer is always nagging dr. chilton for better accommodations .
i don' t know which is the greater fool .
perhaps if you could offer some insight  a robin redbreast in a cage !
puts all heaven in a rage .
ever been a redbreast , will ? .
of course you have .
i' m allowed 30 minutes in here once a week .
get to the point .
i think he meant to use the bolt cutter to enter the house , but he didn' t .
instead , he broke in through the patio doors .
the noise woke jacobi , and he had to shoot him on the stairs .
that wasn' t planned .
it was sloppy , and that' s not like him .
hmm .
we mustn' t judge too harshly , will .
it was his first time .
have you never felt a sudden rush of panic ? .
hmm ? .
yeah , that' s the fear we talked about .
it takes experience to master it .
you sensed who i was back when i was committing what you call my crimes .
yes .
you were hurt not by a fault in your perception or instincts , but because you failed to act on them until it was too late .
you could say that .
but you' re wiser now .
yes .
imagine what you would do , will , if you could go back in time .
put two in your head before you could palm that stiletto ? .
very good , will .
you know , i believe we' re makin ' progress .
and that' s what our pilgrim is doing .
he is refining his methods .
he is evolving .
oh , the case file mentioned videos of the leeds family .
i' d like to see those .
no .
it would be obscene .
why not ? .
you don' t make it easy , do you ? .
still , one aims to please .
i' il call you if i think of anything else .
would you perhaps like to leave me your home number ? .
that' s the end of our session , doctor .
for now .
it was only his first time .
already in atlanta he did much better .
rest assured , my dear will , this one will give you plenty of exercise .
my love to molly and josh .
go to the back of the cell , dr. lecter .
face the wall .
if you turn around before you hear the lock snap , you' il get a dart .
understood ? .
yes , indeed .
you got ten minutes to talk to your lawyer .
starting now .
thanks so much , barney .
hello ? .
dr. lecter ? .
i have those documents you requested .
robes , robespierre , robin .
robin , call for .
robin , fainting .
ta da !
redbreast in a cage .
406 . 9 .
ah .
a robin redbreast in a cage !
puts all heaven in a rage .
yeah , that' s it .
william blake , auguries of innocence .
hmm .
think you got it ? .
yeah , we should have .
um , we have some books of blake' s paintings too .
wanna see' em ? .
yeah , thanks .
psychology department , university of chicago .
dr. bloom' s office .
oh , hi .
this is bob greer at blaine and edwards publishing .
dr. bloom asked me to send a copy of the psychiatrist and the law to will graham .
his assistant was supposed to give me the address and phone number , but , darn it , she never did .
uh , see , i' m just a temp .
linda will be in on monday .
gosh , and i have to catch fedex in about five minutes .
i hate to bother dr. bloom about it at home , ' cause he told linda to send it , and i don' t want to get her into trouble .
it' s right there in her rolodex or whatever .
i' il dance at your wedding if you read it to me .
oh , i don' t know .
i' m really not supposed to .
be a darling and flip that little ol ' rascal , and i won' t take up any more of your time .
graham , comma , will .
oh , all right .
just a minute .
um , gordon , graham .
it doesn' t give the address of the house .
what does it have , dear ? .
f. b. i. , 935 pennsylvania avenue , northwest , washington , d. c.
yeah ? .
oh , and let' s see .
here it is .
p. o. box 3680 , marathon , florida .
marathon .
yeah .
that' s fine .
you' re an angel .
i' m francis dolarhyde .
i' ve come for the package of infrared .
right .
put your back against the door and come forward three steps ... till you feel tile under your feet .
and there' s a stool just on the left .
same mr. d. who' s head of tech services .
am i right ? .
uh huh .
i' m reba mcclane .
just a second more , i will get you some light .
okay .
here we go .
so , what do you need the i. r. for ? .
it' s for the zoo .
they want to photograph the nocturnal animals .
that' s great .
i love animals .
i gotta warn you though .
this stuff is pretty sensitive .
it can be mean to handle .
but i guess i don' t need to tell you that .
hey , reba .
oh , mister d.
whoa .
i' m not interrupting anything here , am i ? .
no , ralph .
listen , reba , it' s starting to spritz outside .
how about i giveyou a lift home ? .
you ride a motorcycle , ralph .
how' s that gonna help me with the rain ? .
well , i thought maybe ... stop off someplace , have ourselves a little sundowner .
i' ve already got a ride .
that' s cool .
that' s cool .
no " problemo .
if there' s anything i hate worse than pity , it' s fake pity especially from a walking hard on like ralph mandy .
sorry .
i have no pity .
ride with me .
thanks , but i take the bus all the time .
mandy is a fool .
ride with me .
for my pleasure .
you wanna come in ? .
i' il fix us a drink .
maybe another time .
i will ... come in .
when is the zoo project ? .
maybe next week .
they' il call .
i love zoos .
in fact , one of my earliest memories is seeing a cougar when i was about five .
i didn' t lose my sight till i was seven .
diphtheria .
could you hand me that knife ? .
anyway , i' ve always tried to hang on to what that cougar looked like .
although by now , to tell you the truth , what i see in my head ... is probably not the least bit like a cougar .
it' s more like a donkey or a goat .
you know , sometimes i' m not so sure i really saw him .
maybe he' s just something i dreamed up .
you okay ? .
uh huh .
you don' t say much , do you ? .
um , no , i guess not .
let' s talk about something for a minute ... and get it out of the way , okay ? .
i can hear that you' ve had ... some kind of soft palate repair .
but i understand you fine because you speak very well .
if you don' t wanna talk to me , that' s cool .
but i hope that you will because ...
i know what it' s like to have people always thinking that you' re different .
mm hmm .
well ... that' s good .
may i touch your face ? .
i wanna know if you' re smiling or frowning .
i wanna know whether i should just shut up or not .
take my word that i' m smiling .
i have to go .
if i offended you , i didn' t mean to .
no .
i' ve been to their house , but i don' t have a sense what the jacobis were like .
it would help me if i could see some of their personal effects .
diaries , letters .
do you have those things , mr. metcalf ? .
oh , i sure do .
i mean , other than one or two little keepsakes niles jacobi got .
that would be mr. jacobi' s surviving son by his first wife ? .
yeah , that' s right .
as their executor , i keep all that stuffhere in the office , along with some of the smaller valuables , till after probate .
but , uh , birmingham p. d. ' s been all through it .
could you pack those things and ship ' em up to me ? .
i hate to ask .
i know it' s a pain in the ass .
ah , hell .
probate judge is an old golfin ' buddy of mine .
son , just tell me you' re gonna nail that son of a bitch .
we' re doing our best .
will ?
hey , thanks , mr. metcalf .
thanks .
a note hidden in lecter' s cell .
sounds like a fan letter mailed by the tooth fairy .
he wants lecter' s approval .
he' s curious about you .
he' s asking questions .
i' ve scrambled a chopper .
does lecter know we have the note ? .
not yet .
it was found during a routine cleanup .
they don' t open his mail ?
can' t .
need a warrant .
x rays only .
where' s lecter now ?
still in the holding cage .
can he see his cell from there ?
no .
he ' s been there almost half an hour .
soon he ' il start to wonder what' s wrong .
we gotta buy time , jack .
dr. chilton ? .
yes ? .
cal i your building superintendent or engineer whoever' s in charge .
tell them to pull the circuit breakers on lecter' s hall .
have the super walk down the hall past the holding cell carrying tools .
he' il be in a hurry , pissed off , too busy to answer any questions .
got it ? .
and don' t forget .
don' t touch the note .
okay ? .
graham' s on his way .
listen up !
we' ve got a note coming in on the fly , possibly from the tooth fairy .
number one priority .
it has to go back to lecter' s cell ... within the hour unmarked .
we' il need hair and fiber , latent prints , then documents .
i' il walk it through myself .
let' s go , people .
my dear dr. lecter
i wanted to tell you i' m delighted that you' ve taken an interest in me .
and when i learned of your vast correspondence ,
i thought , " dare i ?
of course i do .
i don' t believe you' il tell them who i am .
besides , what particular body i currently occupy is trivial .
the important thing is what i am becoming .
i know that you alone can understand this transformation .
i have some things i' d love to show you , if circumstances permit .
i hope we can correspond .
i have admired you for years and have a complete collection ofyour press notices .
actually , i think of them as unfair reviews .
as unfair as mine .
they do like to sling demeaning nicknames , don ' t they ?
the tooth fairy . " what could be more inappropriate ?
it would shame me for you to read that ... if i didn ' t know you had suffered the same distortions in the press .
i ' m fed up with this bloody stupid building .
every day , something breaking .
i swear they ought to tear the whole fuckin ' place down .
how much longer do we have ? .
ten minutes max .
instructions for answering are probably in the section lecter tore out .
but i don' t get it .
why not just throw the whole note away ? .
it was full of compliments .
couldn' t bear to part with them .
now we can mash just a little .
you' re so sly .
but so am i.
aniline dyes and color edinks are transparent to infrared .
these could be the tips of ' t' s " here and here .
on the end , that' s a " p " or possibly an " r.
maybe this is where he' s telling lecter how to answer him .
jack , there' s only one safe way to carry on a conversation that' s one way blind .
publication .
wait a minute .
we know this sweetheart reads the tattler .
that' s in his note , right ? .
the tooth fairy " they made that up .
three " t' s " and an " r " in tattler .
so how do you communicate through a tabloid ? .
you got what ? .
news stories .
personals .
personals .
damn it .
what if the killer wants lecter to answer him through the personal columns ? .
that could be it .
we' re gonna need proofs of those pages before the tattler' s published .
i' m on it .
investigator graham interests me .
not your standard gumshoe , is he ?
more alert , purposeful looking .
you should have taught him not to meddle .
forgive the stationary .
i chose it because it will dissolve very quickly ... if you should have to swallow it .
if i hear from you next time , i might send you something wet .
until then , dear doctor ,
i remain your most ... avid fan .
the t attler got an ad order signed 666 .
balti more postmark on the envelope .
it' s set to run this afternoon .
chicago field office is sending the text through now .
dear pilgrim " that' s it .
doctor called him a pilgrim when we talked .
you honor me .
you' re very beautiful .
christ .
i offer a hundred prayers for your safety .
