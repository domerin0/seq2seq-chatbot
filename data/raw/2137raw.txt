ain' t you folks ever heard of sleeping in ?
i got it , sir .
press has been waiting almost an hour , red .
i hear you .
yeah , i hear you .
i understand .
i understand .
yeah .
no , i' m here .
i' m just listening .
yeah , okay .
what' d he say ?
who ?
the governor , red .
well , he reminded me that it' s an election year .
hi .
hi .
i hope you don' t drink before noon .
oh , no , i don' t .
the last one we had here , seemed like she was on a liquid diet .
last what ?
secretary .
penny monroe .
i believe you have me confused .
see , i' m from huntsville .
i was assigned by the governor .
adler , what is this ?
it rings a bell .
i think they sent something over about her this morning .
who did ?
the governor , red .
i' m sally gerber , criminologist with the state prison system .
tom adler , texas rangers .
hi .
well , it' s a new procedure .
i was assigned by the governor to work
work with state law officials in all affairs of penal matters . . . . . . with the police . " this doesn' t say anything
it includes parole , as well as penal escape situations .
we' il be right there , marge .
they' re getting antsy , red .
you scheduled it .
the idea is that an understanding of case history . . . . . . should , in parole situations , help the subject to avoid habitual traps .
and in penal escape situations . . . . . . could identify those selfsame traps as an aid to apprehension .
let me tell you , miss gerber . . . .
sally is fine .
let me tell you , sally . . . . . . this is not an escape .
this happens to be a manhunt .
and no talking around in circles is gonna fix that .
and what will ?
us having a nose like a blue tick . . . . . . that' s a medulla with an antenna , and a lot of coffee .
we got a handful of caps , and you' re shooting water tanks .
he' s a smart guy , huh , phillip ?
goddamn !
okay , boys , that' s enough !
the chief' s got work to do !
did the kid say anything ?
good morning , red .
good morning .
so , what do you think ?
looks good .
we' re very proud of this baby .
governor ordered it for the parade in dallas .
you know president kennedy' s coming ?
yeah , so i heard .
latest technology .
got an oversized engine . . . . . . full kitchen , sleeping quarters .
got room for gun racks .
stove , fridge , even got a phone to the governor' s office .
fine piece of machinery .
and . . . . . . once it' s back , it' il be at your disposal .
it' s perfect for lots of situations .
it' s a headquarters on wheels .
we' il take it .
chief ?
stop taking pictures !
it' s just not possible .
governor' s gotta ride in it tomorrow .
he gave this manhunt top priority .
but , red listen , you gotta believe me .
red ?
what' s your name ?
dick suttle , the driver .
not anymore .
bradley ?
this man stays with his vehicle .
you know how to work all the gadgets ?
oh , yes , sir .
okay , take a seat .
excuse me , red .
this here' s bobby lee .
he' s a specialist with the feds .
they want him to tag along .
red , what am i supposed to tell the governor ?
well , you tell him that miss sally gerber over there . . . . . . from his office , checked me out on this .
oh , hell .
hey !
hello ?
you coming or aren' t you ?
not a scratch !
you hear me , suttle ?
on the truck !
on the trailer !
and you call me !
you call me !
why the hell we stopping ?
you said you had a cousin near here .
so ?
so call him .
see if we can shack there till things cool down .
why' d he take the keys ?
so i won' t leave him .
would you leave him ?
oh , yeah .
he must' ve moved .
probably couldn' t have heard him anyways , my ear' s still bleeding .
you ever try that shit again  what ?
what ?
you were starting to threaten me .
it ain' t a threat .
it' s a fact .
here , kid , take the wheel .
in two seconds , i' m gonna break your nose .
that' s a threat .
and that' s a fact .
i' m gonna kill you for that .
and that' s a threat .
beginning to understand the difference ?
phillip , listen up .
i' m gonna run in and get some smokes .
get beer .
here , hold this .
point it right between his eyes .
what the hell ?
if he so much as moves , you pull the trigger .
right here , see ?
put your finger on it .
you' re a fucking crazy man .
that' s a fact .
you' re getting the hang of this .
how do ?
where' s your sodas ?
the hot ones are there .
the cold ones are in the back , in the cooler .
you ever shot a gun before , boy ?
pow !
knock you on your ass .
quiet , mister .
no . . . .
you ain' t never shot no gun before .
living with three split tails .
no daddy around .
you' il probably grow up queer , you know that ?
now . . . . . . i' m gonna lean up here real slow and easy .
okay ?
just so that we can talk .
there we go .
now we can have a real man to man .
you are a man , now , ain' t you ?
will this do it for you ?
this and a carton of lucky strikes .
those are some real cute little underwears you got on there .
your mama sew your name in them ?
lnitials or anything ?
let' s see what you got down there .
kind of puny , ain' t it ?
the hand is quicker than the eye .
son of a bitch .
hell' s bells , no shells .
come on up here a little closer , boy .
those . 38 shells you got up there ?
yeah .
why don' t you give me a box ?
goddamn !
jesus !
jesus !
here , boy .
all is forgiven , boy .
you best come here , boy .
you know i' m gonna find you .
hey , boy , you best hope i don' t find you .
what' re you gonna do ?
hit me with it ?
but you and me are friends .
you got a phone ?
no .
go inside , lie down till we' re gone .
well , you coming ?
get in .
red , i got a spot on them .
a store outside of ben hur , 50 miles from here .
yeah .
well , move that roadblock on 288 50 miles north .
figure they got that far ?
i don' t know .
but they don' t either .
they' re just glad to be out .
this is a sunday drive for them .
sunday drive , i like that .
i never heard you use that one before .
is something bothering you ?
it' s perhaps premature , but . . . . . . do you have an auxiliary roadblock plan for when they split up ?
what makes you so sure they' il split up ?
if you got something in your craw , spit it out .
their situation is an accommodation .
i don' t think they' il be together long .
haynes and pugh are opposites , right ?
haynes is a criminal' s criminal .
robbery , man on man confrontation .
pugh has a rap sheet littered with manslaughter , you name it .
they' il split soon .
what about the hostages ?
what are they gonna do ?
flip a coin ?
it' s happened before .
it' s a dilemma they' il address soon .
that' s why we gotta address it now .
we don' t have a dilemma .
neither do they .
they' il get rid of one hostage and keep the other .
if they haven' t already .
command , put your roadblock on 288 , north about 50 miles .
that' s right , 50 miles .
uh huh .
we need to talk , chief garnett .
you can call me red .
red . . . . . . why are you so hell bent on embarrassing me ?
i' m only hell bent on one thing .
you get to know me . . . . . . you' il find having a sense of humor will get you a lot .
i have a fine sense of humor .
but i won' t be your straight man . . . . . . so you can play hero to morons who think you' re sherlock holmes .
oh , shit !
damn .
arthur godfrey said this stuff keeps you young .
i' m not sure it' s worth it .
so that' s my answer ?
this is your first time in the field ?
i thought so .
what was you expecting anyway ?
you think i' m some dumb schoolgirl . . . . . . who' s wandered into the boys ' locker room ?
you' re wrong .
i don' t mean to boast . . . . . . but i happen to be one of the two most intelligent people in this fiasco .
i didn' t ask that .
i asked what you' re expecting .
i expected to be allowed to do the job assigned to me by the governor .
i like the governor .
he and i go quail hunting at least once a year .
but he knows that win , lose or draw , this is my ship .
understand ?
yeah , i got that .
you know what that is ?
that' s anarchy .
and i call that horseshit , to use a cowboy colloquialism .
no , i' il tell you what' s horseshit .
horseshit is responsibility .
that' s the guy who has sleepless nights and ulcers .
if this thing goes bloody , the governor , he loses a few votes .
me , i' m the one who . . . .
i' il tell you what .
you see me making a wrong move , go ahead and speak up .
i might not agree , but i' il listen .
as for wounded pride , i' il buy all the drinks when this is over . . . . . . but right now i got better things to think about .
that fair ?
yeah .
good .
so who' s the other one ?
other one ?
you' re one of the two brains .
who' s the other ?
haynes .
we tested him in prison .
thank you .
are you gonna shoot me ?
no !
hell , no .
me and you are friends .
if i was choosing a running buddy , i' d take you over him any day of the week .
we got a positive l . d. ?
yes , sir .
only the boy is hostage .
not five minutes ago , we found this here .
yeah .
at least now we know who' s in charge .
you ever ridden in a time machine before ?
you have .
what do you think this is ?
a car .
you' re looking at this bass ackwards .
this is a 20th century time machine .
i' m the captain and you' re the navigator .
out there , that' s the future .
and back there , well , that' s the past .
if life' s moving too slow , to project yourself into the future . . . . . . you step on the gas right here .
see ?
and if you want to slow her down , you just step on the brake here . . . . . . and you slow her down .
this is the present , phillip .
enjoy it while it lasts .
yes , sir , we' re time traveling through texas .
we gotta find us a ford .
my daddy always drove fords , you know that ?
that' s an intercom system .
now , you can get and give information to and from the rear vehicle .
how' s it work ?
well , you press the power button .
but if you' ve got the volume turned up . . . .
bradley , dang it !
you will blow the speakers .
my god . . . .
there .
that should put his pecker in a sling .
sorry , ma' am .
dick humor , unique .
shouldn' t these be roadblocked ?
now , in a perfect world . . . . . . we' d lock arms and thrash the bushes until he turned up .
in a perfect world , things like this wouldn' t happen .
adler , we' re proceeding on fm 1491 .
our locals are heading out .
you want to follow them ?
no , we' il just keep cruising .
he' il turn up eventually .
okay , we' re gonna do some car shopping .
you ever play cowboys and lndians ?
see that ford sedan ?
i want you to sneak over there like an lndian and take a peek .
see if the keys is in it .
don' t have to if you don' t want to .
but i' d appreciate it , you being the navigator and all .
hey , phillip !
phillip !
check for a radio too .
it' s got keys and a radio .
i checked .
good man .
can we stop at the filling station ?
what for ?
number one .
this here' s nature , phillip .
you just pee over by the tree .
that' s my car !
start , you son of a bitch !
get in the car , phillip !
phillip , get in the car !
jump !
goddamn , how many rcs did you drink ?
four .
adler , if we get a clean shot , can we take it ?
red , if they get a clean shot , should they take it ?
no .
i don' t want any half ass sergeant taking a potshot with a deer rifle .
right thing to do , he' s got the boy .
you figure he' il just give up .
maybe , maybe not .
well , now , there' s a safe bet .
well , he' s better off now than he was .
that third eye pugh is sporting in the morgue speaks otherwise .
then why not just shoot to kill ?
now , there' s a brainstorm .
the roadblock' s got the stolen vehicle' s license .
you still want to go to the farm ?
yeah .
yeah , i got a hunch .
never met a brown eyed phillip before .
who are you named after ?
my daddy .
you and your old man get along ?
yes , sir .
toss the ball around , play grab ass in the yard ?
no , sir .
why the hell not ?
he ain' t around , really .
well , he is or he ain' t .
when' s the last time you saw him ?
me and you got a lot in common , phillip .
the both of us is handsome devils .
we both like rc cola .
and neither one of us got an old man worth a damn .
my mama says he' il come back .
probably when i' m 1 0 or so .
well , she' s lying to you , pure and simple .
all right ?
he ain' t ever coming back .
guys like us , phillip . . . . . . we gotta be on our own .
seek foolish destiny .
that sort of thing .
you responsible for the maintenance on that ?
that' s right .
i' m the full time driver .
what ?
it' s slipping a bit going into second .
seems like somebody' s been heavy footed with the clutch .
i' d put that on a list if i was you .
well . . . . . . ain' t no bodies here , thank god .
you got the keys to this vehicle ?
no .
see if we got a pry bar in the car .
yes , sir .
here you go , red .
you might want to wait in the boat .
please .
well , there' s our bureaucrat .
nice to know the boy' s in good hands .
here .
i don' t want  gallows humor , sally .
without it , we' d all be losing our lunch .
want some water ?
no .
you ready to get into some britches ?
all right , then , let' s go .
first , we gotta come up with some a . k . a . ' s .
you know , fake identities .
names to call each other when we' re around other folks .
you go ahead and you think one up .
whatever name you want .
any name i want ?
any name you want .
well , hello there , and welcome to friendly' s .
looks like he needs some pants .
as a matter of fact , shoes and new skivvies too .
he' il tell you his size .
go with the lady , buzz .
buzz .
buzz .
go with the lady .
buzz , what a cute little name .
like a bee .
oh , look , a friendly ghost .
say " boo .
boo .
not very scary .
but you' il have a whole year to work on it .
it' s a good price too .
what did you go as this year ?
a bandit .
oh , shit !
pete .
yeah ?
this is terrance .
i think i got it .
what do you think ?
look good .
will that be all for you today , sir ?
you folks are about the grinningest bunch i ever seen .
mr. willits holds a contest every month .
the friendliest employee gets a $20 bonus .
pete , i' m all set down here .
you ?
copacetic .
let' s just keep him tied up till the state boys get here .
the hunt continues for butch haynes ... ... who escaped from the security unit over in huntsville .
haynes , 6' 1 " , 185 pounds with brown hair , is armed and dangerous .
he was last seen in ....
here are the clothes .
buzz has his heart set on a halloween costume for next year .
it' s half off . four miles south of desdemona .
complicating attempts to catch him ... ... haynes has an 8 year old boy with him as hostage .
authorities have found the slain body ....
we' il get it next time .
go wait in the car , son . hostage taken by haynes and his fellow escapee , terry pugh .
billings ' body was found in the trunk of his car .
the car , used in the prison escape ... ... was discarded near a farm where another car was stolen this morning .
the stolen car is a yellow ford sedan .
anyone who spots it should contact law enforcement offiicials .
as we reported earlier , the body of terry pugh ....
you' re truly the friendliest clerk i ever met .
thank you for shopping friendly' s .
copy , 149 , hold your 20 .
damn !
what the what the hell ? !
he' s coming back !
get out of there !
we can' t lose both vehicles !
i knew something was wrong from the get go .
look , he left his little boy !
he' s got the casper costume !
he stole it !
buzz , you little shit !
shoplifting is a crime !
up to you , buzz !
you' il never get away with this , you little mister !
you ain' t so friendly .
take them nasty skivvies off , put these jeans on .
what do you got there ?
a ghost suit .
from the store ?
you kiped it ?
well , hell , phillip , put it on .
you ain' t mad ?
let' s understand each other .
stealing' s wrong , okay ?
but if there' s something you need bad and you ain' t got the money . . . . . . it' s okay to take a loaner on the item .
it' s what you call an exception to the rule .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
you don' t want to get undressed in front of me ?
you embarrassed because i might see your pecker ?
it' s . . . . . . puny .
what ?
it' s puny .
who told you that ?
let me see .
go on , i' il shoot you straight .
hell , no , phillip .
it' s a good size for a boy your age .
here they come .
he bought some tape , rope , and clothes for the kid .
the kid could have gotten away , but he didn' t .
probably scared to death .
well , one more thing .
the kid stole a halloween outfit .
so they' re a team .
with a pit stop in noodle , they' re heading for the panhandle .
there' s more roads than people there .
how ?
poor counties .
they half finish a road , start another .
if anybody knows them back roads , it' s red .
okay . . .
. . . so . . . . . . i' m robert haynes .
everybody calls me butch .
i was born in amarillo . . . . . . but grew up in the french quarter in new orleans .
what' s she doing , red ?
i killed a man when i was 8 .
how did you kill him ?
shot him with a . 38 .
there was always one lying around the dance hall .
that' s what they called it , but it was a brothel .
we lived there .
what did the authorities do ?
victim was wanted by the locals . . . . . . so the whole thing got swept under the carpet , cajun style .
they didn' t even send him to the juvie ?
put me in school .
i was three years behind , but i catch up .
things are going pretty good now .
yeah , they are for a while .
and when i' m 1 2 , mama dies .
what happened ?
delilah jane haynes hung herself in the bathroom of the whorehouse .
post mortem check uncovered last stage syphilis .
where' s your father ?
nobody knows where he is .
ditched when i was 6 .
he was a small time felon .
popped back up after mama died .
he' d just been put on parole , so he moves us back to amarillo .
a year later , i' m back in trouble .
kill somebody else ?
saw a ford coupe i couldn' t resist .
so i took her for a spin .
hell , that ain' t no big deal .
that' s what i thought .
but the judge didn' t .
i got four years in gatesville , toughest juvie in texas .
that' s where he learned to be a criminal .
we' ve seen that before .
butch , why don' t you tell us where you' re headed . . . . . . and save us some trouble .
see , you missed it .
because where i' m going . . . . . . isn' t near as important as why i' m going there .
shit !
because i' m running , they' re chasing . . . . . . i' d just as soon go north , as south , as east , as west .
it' s a fun little game . . . . . . but right now , haynes doesn' t have any idea where he' s headed .
hold your pointing finger along the line of the road , okay ?
okay , you got three lines on a finger , don' t you ?
each one' s an inch .
so how many inches to childress ?
one . . . . . . two . . . .
six .
you' re a hell of a navigator , phillip !
a lot smarter than terry .
of course , who you gonna brag to about that ?
lookie there !
what is it ?
it' s kind of like a silver whale .
and there' s people inside , just like old jonah in the bible .
go like this , maybe they' il honk back at us .
what do you think ?
well , okay , do it .
the boy stole a halloween costume ?
which one ?
it was casper the friendly ghost .
that was them passing us !
what ? !
that was them !
turn around !
bradley , turn around !
it' s not safe to do more than 65 with this much load .
they' re coming fast .
get down in the seat and lay down .
why ?
hell , i don' t know .
because i said so .
you' re burning her up !
hold on .
come on !
take that wide !
what' re you doing ?
i' m following the fugitive , fool !
what are you doing now ?
uh , red . . . .
shit .
red ?
red' s gonna be pissed now .
oh , god !
are you trying to kill us ? !
shit .
yeah .
oh , my god .
idiot !
red , they wanna know if the boy looked okay .
he was laughing and waving .
don' t tell them that .
no .
they said the boy looked a okay .
well , that' s great .
he' il be fine , mrs. perry .
this' il be over before you know it .
you' il be home with your boy .
i promise .
i want you to know that i' ve okayed the use . . . . . . of a new high tech mobile home from which to conduct this manhunt .
it' s an amazingly futuristic piece of law enforcement equipment .
started this road 20 years ago .
still ain' t finished .
it appears to me we got a decision to make .
it' s up to you .
we can backtrack to the highway or we can try it on foot .
where are we going ?
it' s alaska , phillip .
last of the wild frontier .
it' s pretty .
it' s beautiful .
you ever been there ?
no .
i just got the one postcard .
but anyhoo , back to our present dilemma .
you feel like a hike ?
how far ?
can' t be more than , say . . . . . .
1 500 miles .
you' re probably right .
go give our supplies a check .
what' s it look like ?
a soda , some gum , and half a moonpie .
rations for one , at best .
come on .
red !
the governor insists on having the trailer back for the parade tomorrow .
tell him to come get it .
yes , sir .
where are we going ?
we' re going trick or treating .
what' s the matter ?
we' re not allowed to trick or treat .
huh ?
my mama doesn' t allow it .
trick or treating ?
why not ?
against our religion .
it' s against your what kind of foolishness is that ?
jehovah' s witness .
now , phillip , i' m asking you .
i ain' t asking your mother or jehovah .
you wanna go trick or treating or not ?
okay , all you gotta do is knock on the door .
and when they answer it , you say , " trick or treat . " got it ?
now , wait till they come .
now , phillip .
trick or treat .
if you ain' t the cutest little ghost i ever did see .
say it again .
trick or treat , ma' am .
since halloween was yesterday , you' re gonna have to trick me .
and you missed them caramel popcorn balls i made up special .
just wait right here .
perfect .
what do you say , phillip ?
thank you .
never underestimate the kindness of the common man , phillip .
you sure there' s no meat in there ?
spam maybe ?
vienna sausage , anything like that ?
nothing .
can you make some mustard sandwiches ?
yes , sir .
well , go to it .
here , you can spread it with that .
yeah , that one' s mine .
be right back .
don' t be stingy with that mustard , now .
hold it right there .
you can go .
butch !
butch !
phillip !
butch , help !
grab the kids .
quick !
run !
phillip !
forget the car , bob .
it' s only got 1 000 miles on it !
phillip , hit the brake !
butch !
oh , my !
