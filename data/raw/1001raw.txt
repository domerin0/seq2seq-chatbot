so don' t come into my classroom with that ignorant nonsense ,,, about the heroes of the alamo and davy crockett ,,, and how bad they were ,,, because all they were really doing ,,, was robbing another people of their land ,,, so that they could keep opening up new territories for legal slavery ,
the papers that i gave you have a series of quotes ,,, from some antislavery writers of that time period ,
you read the first quote , rosie ,
it' s from an antislavery writer by the name of david child ,,, written to the mexican government ,,, warning them about his own united states government ,
read it to the class , [ rosie ]
dear sirs , there is an impatient and almost ir
irresistible desire in the south and southwest ,,, to lay hold on texas " [ miss coleman ]

' cause there' s little hassle all the way around .
you find your niche , you stay there , you stay cool ... and you be the man into your 50' s and 60' s .
and then you retire your old ass to a nice condo someplace hot ... with a lot of nicejewish people .
leave the business for your kids .
