.... quarre .
quarre .
it' s an alias .
i reaily had a photograph , not of that psychopath .
but ....
shh , there' s a game on .
thank you , dear .
don' t gloat .
i' m not gloating , don' t be a sore ioser .
maybe he' s onto us for seattle .
you shouldn' t have iet him see you .
i wasn' tjust going to iet him walk out of here .
the questions are : what are we going to do with him ?
what if there are more of him ?
kiii him .
we do not kiii him .
because the penalties for kiiling are so distasteful .
yeah , that' s easy for you to say .
he didn' t have your picture .
he has no picture , hoop .
perhaps we should outfit you with a wooden club and a ioincloth .
are you ....
are you cailing me backward ?
the best way to chase something , hoop , is to iet it chase you .
greetings , erin .
business .
that' s what you always say .
this is a business .
teii the old people the schedule' s been moved up a day .
a day ?
that' s today .
that' s why you' ii want to hurry .
sorry .
you should try to have a calming influence on hoop ..
.. rather than a inflammatory one .
is it your place to teii me who not to inflame ?
as a matter of fact it is .
with this rose , i thee wed .
aii things in good time .
untii then , ..
.. iover and loved .
pimp and whore .
coarseness does not become you .
that sick fuck .
it' ii aii be over soon .
aii of it ?
this job , our iast .
you and him ?
that over ?
what do you mean ?
you know what i mean .
he hurts you .
keeps us down .
i got to pack .
i' ii help .
if tyrone sees you in my bedroom ....
we' re just talking , for christ' s sake .
okay .
later then .
hoop .
i never chose tyrone .
yeah , but sometimes you iaugh at me with him .
he expects it of me .
don' t you understand that ?
fucking cop' s iistening .
hoop .
the cop' s not our problem .
tyrone .
so we ieave the airstrip no iater than 8 pm .
don' t smoke that in here .
i sure as heii won' t miss you teiling me what to do .
controi freak .
controi is a good thing , thomas .
you could do with more of it .
controi that .
then we iand in bermuda no iater than 2 am .
correct ?
aye aye , sir .
we refuel .. .. and hoop' s piloting the balance of the journey to the caymans .
is he taking his meds ?
yes , i assume so , why ?
he asked me to teach him to fly , .. .. but i' m not responsible if he flies off the handle .
i wiii controi hoop .
how' d you know where to find us ?
i didn' t .
you' re not who i' m iooking for .
i have a pict
yeah , right .
a picture with a guy with blond hair , blue eyes .
i' m iooking for a girl .
oh , now it' s a girl .
gee , you know i just can' t keep your stories straight .
hoop !
stop it !
alright .
settle down .
these are too tight .
eventuaily i' m going to be alone with you , cop .
get away from him .
is that better ?
thanks .
there is a picture .
and there is a girl .
was it out of wiilfulness or out of stupidity you iet him see you ?
i' m sorry , tyrone .
but i think he seems to have seen you too .
no he hasn' t .
it seems he' s smarter than you .
she' s iike a spoiled child .
hatefui towards those who take care of her .. .. and yet totaily dependent .
leave her alone .
and hoop is the spoiled boy .
the spoiled boy , .. .. to whom i gave a future despite the metai plate in his head .. .. and the diagnosed psychosis .
now , hoop , .. .. was it the beile of tacos or the king of burgers .. .. which had most recently rejected your services ?
what are you iaughing at , cop ? !
maybe it' s good that our stay in these close quarters nears its end .
brunch is ready .
no , brunch is canceled .
the unexpected appearance by the officer has altered our plans .
excuse me .
i have been cooking since his god damned appearance .
no one said anything .
weil , perhaps brunch is just what we need .
who would iike to say the blessing ?
how about our guest ?
he should say a prayer .
leave him alone .
you have nothing to worry about .
i' m sure everything wiii go as planned .
i' ii say the blessing .
thank you , lord , for that which we are about to receive ....
ten miilion doilars , amen !
you always forget the ketchup .
bring me a beer .
please .
no , thank you .
he' s probably not used to eating a proper breakfast .
this is delicious .
remember you' re flying , thomas .
i flew 57 missions in korea .. .. and i was drunk every damn time .
don' t you tei  let him drink .
i' ii fly the damn plane .
i' ii iet you co pilot , shut the fuck up while i' m teiling my story .
excuse me , dear , .. .. but nobody gives a titty about your story .
i don' t want this punk interrupting me .

you want to fly ?
i' ii iet you fly .
come on .

your clothing is inappropriate .

i needed to see erin .
she ieft me a message , it' s important .
she' s not available just now .
where is she ?
frankly i don' t know .
i just came in from shopping .
i' m sure she' ii get in touch with you iater .
why don' t you go back to your office ?
if mr. quarre knew you were playing hooky .. .. he might not iook so kindly on you dating his granddaughter .
david !
erin !
hey !
it' s happening today .
what ?
yeah , now .
why ?
weil , i don' t know why .
but tyrone says it has to be .
look , i can' t .

go back to the bank and we' ii see you soon , okay ?
david , i' m in the street in my robe .
look , i adore you .
thomas !
isabeile !
if we' re delayed , simply wait at the ianding field .

look , miss ....
erin , please .
erin .
you need to iet me go before that head case hoop comes back to kiii me .
tyrone won' t iet hoop kiii you .
tyrone is against kiiling .
so ...
do you want any kind of music ?
you iike some music ?
look , miss , please ....
i can' t iet you escape , .. .. because then i would have to escape and no one escapes tyrone .
that' s ridiculous .
is it ?
this is how tyrone says you shouldn' t have ieft .
it' s alright , i get ten percent off my pedicures now .
are you taking your medication ?
why ?
you appear agitated .
yeah , weii you piss me off .
they got a medication to make you stop doing that ?
what do you plan on doing with your share of the money ?
i want ... to breed dogs ..

maybe there is , maybe there isn' t .
d
david brewster .
we' re here .
hoop is beginning .
why are we doing this today ?
what ?
what did you say ?
i need an explanation .
your explanation wiii be your share of the money .
is erin there ?
no she' s not .
but i have complete faith .. .. you wiii be able to swindle your bank without her .
just make sure you' re available for me when i enter .
you don' t iook so good .
that' s because you' re used to iooking at you .
maybe that drink wasn' t such a good idea .
what should i do ?
what should you do ?
find that picture so you can see i was teiling the truth .. .. and you can teii your friends .
i' ii iook a iot better when i' m not waiting for someone to kiii me .

i' ve been thinking about some of those missions ....
has the plane been fueled ?
yes .
and i' ii be here just as iong as you need me .
excuse me , sir .
i put your kit in the fridge .
you could have iet me die .
cop dead from a diabetic coma .
it' s perfect .
dump the body somewhere .
nobody would ever know i' d been kidnapped .
i guess i owe you one .
i mean that .
i noticed your suitcases were packed .
were you supposed to be somewhere else today ?
not on turk street .
like where ?
the berkshires .
fantasy camp for frustrated musicians .
basketbaii junkies go to michaei jordan' s basketbaii clinic .
i get my fix playing with yo yo ma .
your apartment struck me as ionely .
don' t cops dream ?
nightmares mostly .
i don' t trust you ieaving here without seeing erin .
then by aii means you should caii her for reassurance .
i trust she' s at home .
women talk .
some excessively .
yes ?
we got problems .
the system is patched into a backup power source .. .. that' s more complicated than i thought .
can you deactivate it ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i' m working on it .
it' s just going to take some time .
how much ?
i don' t know .
two , three minutes tops .
do it !
did i hear what i just heard ?
i was a state sponsored prodigy untii moscow coilapsed .
my peers became prostitutes , musicaily or otherwise .
i met a man in a bar .
tyrone became your ticket out .
he said he saw my potential .
i flattered myself he meant my music .
so you guys are robbing a bank , right ?
how ?
just smile .. .. as you teii me about the federai reserve .
you reaily don' t know who we are ?
i' m just a cop who finds stolen cars .. .. who' s iooking for a iost girl .
and iook , you found one .
you are not iost .
it would take a search party to find me .
what are you doing ?
stand .
ladies and gentlemen , please calm down .
i' m sure the problem wiii be fixed momentarily .
send the money .
send the money !
send the money !
sir , i' m sorry , i' m sure the problem is just momentary .
i don' t have moments .
teii your officer to wire my ioan immediately .
we wire funds electronicaily .
our computers are down ....
weil , to heii with your computers !
my funds must be sent by 6 o' clock .
i' m afraid that if wiring the funds is an impossibility ....
have you heard of this device ?
can it not be used with your approvai to transfer funds ?
sir , please , please just calm yourself .
if you' ii just step into my office .
would you mind ?
do you know " chanson triste " by du parc ?
do you iike being tied up in a chair ?
or would you rather play some beautifui music ?
how much are we talking about ?
ten miilion .
our spread is substantial .
it went to committee .
now , think iender iiability , sirs .
if those funds aren' t in escrow by day' s end .. .. my company wiii iose a one hundred miilion doilar contract .
so consider that to be your true exposure .
my iaptop is charged .
i could modem it through .
i' m cailing my iawyer .
sir , that won' t be necessary .
get the iaptop .
i missed a few notes .
that' s a nice piece .
i never played it before .
i know what i want for saving your iife .
what' s that ?
they say playing the ceilo is iike dancing .
show me .
how ?
you' d have to put the gun down .
it' s crazy .
i believe in the concept of a man and a woman .
and the man owing her one .
i mean , you did say that , didn' t you ?
that you owe me one .
don' t do this .
damn you .
put your hand on mine .
a.
d.
g.
i could break your neck .
i should .
yeah , you should .
are we done ?
yeah , we' re done .
we' re even .
mr. abernathy , this disk contains aii the routing information , .. .. account numbers and passwords .
it' s your authentication .
great , just a iittle more paperwork .
now , ..
.. about erin .
he insists on meeting erin at his place .
we don' t have time for this .
do we know where the banker iives ?
yeah , it' s over the mountain .
it' s a haul .
you' ve been there ?
i drove her a couple of times .
i thought they used to meet in restaurants .
weil , maybe he cooks .
go there .
tyrone cailed .
he said it could be another couple of hours .
i sent wiily for dinner .
tyrone ?
and you trust him ?
this job is no different from seattle .. .. or sydney or dailas or miami .
and he stiii needs us .
unless he thinks he can take a bus to the caymans .
but this is our iast one .
then he wouldn' t have cailed .
do you think we' ii be happy in fiji ?
we can have sex on the beach .
oh thomas !
let' s go wait in the airplane .
you know i won' t have sex on airplanes .
but this one' s on the ground .
when was he ieaving the bank ?
he should have been here 45 minutes ago .
she gabs on the phone , even as the outcome remains unsettled .
not even you would be that dim witted .
maybe the two of them are working together .
get out of the car .
what ?
get out of the car .
why ?
watch for him .
hey , it' s raining out here !
then go inside .
get in !
but there was a accident .
i don' t want to hear about it .
get in !
you see that ?
what ?
this !
this !
this !
this !
just how would he find you ?
not by iooking .
he knows where i' d go .
he can hear me think .
what would he do when he found you ?
maybe he' d kiii me .
maybe you could prevent that from happening .
maybe ...
maybe he and hoop are coming back to kiii you .
you worked your way partiaily free from the bonds .
you' d have no choice but to kiii them in self defense .
so give me the gun .
we could wind up with ten miilion doilars .
you know what happens to cops who have ten miilion doilars .
they eat their service revolvers .
they can' t ....
open your mind , jack .
you' re more than a cop .
i' m more than a thief .
you' d know that if you' re paying attention .
i have been .
and i know .
erin ?
where is she ?
erin !
hey , banker boy !
what are you doing in my house ?
you should thank him .
look what a splendid effort he made infiltrating your bank today .
where' s the disk ?
ahh gee , it' s iocked !
there' s no fucking disk !
where is it ?
hey , what' s this , huh ?
go ahead , .. .. it' s password protected .
okay !
okay !
okay !
but i just risked everything for erin .
you think i' m going to blab now just to get out of a beating ?
weil ... tick tock .
what time is it ?
they haven' t cailed .
must' ve ieft you behind .
or should i say they ieft your ass ?
they wouldn' t .
no , and a fine ass it is .
you can keep sitting on it untii my cop friends start iooking for me .
or you can cut me ioose , come in with me and teii what happened .
damn !
what ?
what ?
bastard !
i' m to blame now ?
go ahead , but that stiii doesn' t change the facts .
they didn' t need you and ieft your ass .
shush !
god !
heilo ?
why has the phone been occupied ?
i' m sorry , i didn' t even know it was off the hook .
why didn' t you check it ?
how could i know it was off the hook ?
your friend here insists on seeing you .. .. before he gives us our information .
you must have fucked your way into his heart .
hoop' s on his way for me .
i have to get ready .
so this is your first crime ?
yeah .
no embezzlement , no juggling ....
no .
nothing .
not even as a kid ?
no shoplifting , no peeping tom ?
hardly .
so this reaily is your inauguration .
take my advice ...
you know , i stole my dad' s car once .
reaily ?
yeah .
drove it to mexico .
what happened ?
drove it off a cliff .
never even told my father .
apparently , driving isn' t one of your talents .
come on in here !
come on !
jack , please .

keep coming .
come on , pick up the phone !
what are you doing ?

david !
erin !
i tried to be there but he ieft without me .
quick , what' s the password ?
we need some time together .
weil , there' s no time .
weil , certainly a short interlude can be squeezed in for young iovers .
give me the gun .
give them fifteen minutes , no more .
i did it !
i did it !
i knew you could .
come here , come here .
not giving tyrone the password was so smart .
god , who knows what he would have done if i wasn' t here .
so what is it ?
oh no , no , no .
i' m going to the caymans with you .
you cannot be seen with tyrone .
not now , not ever .
i' m only going to be gone for a few days .
then we can go away together iike we planned .
i don' t think i can wait any ionger .
oh , you poor thing .
as soon as we get the money .
i promise .
enough promises .
oh , shit .
i was dreaming , ..
.. we were on this beach .
i iooked wonderfui in my bikini .

our young friend became difficult .

password accepted .
it might be the quarres .
continue north , hoop .
what about the plane ?
we don' t need a plane .
we' ii be driving to our destination .
i see no reason to share this .. .. with that boorish man and that insipid woman .
our shares wiii increase accordingly .
is somebody planning on teiling me where we' re going ?
we' re driving to albany , .. .. new york , where i' ve cultivated some banking relationships .
then what ?
then a mere three hour drive to the canadian border .
i need to use the bathroom .
you should have done that back at the house .
i didn' t know that back at the house !
we have a six hour drive to albany .
and if we' re not out of the country by 2 pm , .. .. you' ii have no pot to piss in .
we need to get gas anyway .
fiii it up quickly and check the tires .
erin , do me a favor .
wipe off the dead banker .
tyrone .
the cop had this .
he wasn' t iooking for hoop .. .. for beating up some clerk in seattle , he was iooking for you .
maybe i shouldn' t have told you .
teii him .
i arranged for you to get the gun .
he wants you to kiii the cop .
yeah .
but it' s not what we want .
yeah .
okay .
what ?
tire .
.... in the middle of nowhere .
why have you stopped here ?
i' m going to check the spare in the trunk .
what do you mean the spare ?
didn' t i teii you to check it back at the gas station ?
any iast words , brainiac ?
i' ii spare you my wisdom , you' ii forsake it anyway .
oh no please , i' m sure i' ii miss it .
i' ii iook at your iife as a novel , ..
.. this being the tragic moment .. .. at which , in the ultimate irony , .. .. our headstrong hero shoots himself in the brain .
so iet me get this straight : you' re my brain ?
not only that , i' m also the restraint that you iack .
stand back .
without me , you would be in prison or worse .
you reaily think you would thrive so without me ?
witness tonight .
because i wasn' t standing right beside you .. .. you kiiled a man .
and once you shoot me , you' ii have kiiled two men today .
and the cop , three .
do you imagine that erin wiii ride into the sunset with you ?
shut that music off !
turn it down !
okay !
okay !
hoop !
what are you doing ?
nothing .
our friend only got a iittle overexcited .
it' s better now , isn' t it ?
yeah .
get in the car .
not you .
were you behind this ?
you told me to give him the gun .
so the policeman reaily is after me ?
yes .
we' ii see .
an unfortunate detour , i' m afraid .
i need the gun .
no .
use another method .
i' ve seen that you can .
go .
hoop , wait !
weil , now my dear , .. .. witnessing an execution you caused is only going to be awkward .
what could you possibly say to the man ?
cop !
i told you i' d be back .
i hope you know how to die fast .. .. because we need to be in albany by eight .
you know how to die fast ?
die fast , cop .
fast .
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster , cop !
spare yourself the effort .
we iack time , so forgive my brevity .
were you carrying a photograph when you stumbled upon our house ?
yeah .
now iook at me .
was the picture of me ?
was this the picture ?
that wasn' t the picture , that wasn' t the fucking picture !
leave him alone !
the truth is it hardly matters .
a kiiling has already occurred .
not just this one but another man as weil .
so the stakes have been raised .
it does make sense to clean up ioose ends .
and i' m a ioose end .
the ioosest .
erin ...
come here .
now , just put your finger there .
easy , this is your baptism .
you think ' cause you' ve already kiiled somebody , kiiling me is no big deal ?
you kiii me and every cop on the planet takes a sudden vacation .
you become the case that never closes , the guy they never stop huntin ' .
you be job one .
pay attention , erin , ' cause this applies to you , too .
when they catch you , wherever they catch you .. .. they' re going to subdue you .
and they' re going to subdue you substantiaily .
then they' re going to teii you to run .. .. and that' s going to confuse you , ' cause you never heard that before .
then your animai brain' s going to kick in with the survivai mode .
hey , they' re ietting me go " .
so you' ii run .
and then what ?
then they shoot you , dumb ass .
weil , don' t you think they have to catch me first ?
oh , you' re thinking aii that money is going to help you hide ?
that' s funny , ' cause those shit for brains over there told me about your .. .. time frame .
now , if you planned on driving to albany in six hours , .. .. that means you' re going to use the new jersey turnpike .
and you' re probably going to drive at night .
but now you' re iate .. .. and you hadn' t counted on rush hour .
so if you think you' re stiii going to make that drive in six hours .. .. you got another thing coming .
dearest , i don' t remember hearing anything about albany .
i knew it !
you dirty double crossing bastard !
put it down .
nobody' s trying to cross you , thomas .
give him the disk .
now .
oh , god !
what have i done ?
oh , god !
this is a weil oiled machine !
look , why don' t you take me with you ?
what ?
you can' t get the money on your own , but you can with my help .
my car' s got flashing iights and a siren , .. .. i can stiii get you to albany in time .
you get as much of the money as you can , .. .. i drive you to the border , you go across .
hey , you promise me a share , maybe i' ii cross with you .
and then what ?
i need some more insulin .
.. when we get across we iet the giri decide who she wants to go with .
you propose driving through a busy city with a captive policeman .
you must think me a foolhardy man .
take a turn at the next corner .
left .
now ieft again .
i thought we were going to the freeway .
turn again .
left .
go there .
out of the car , both of you .
further .
here .
so how do you move ten miilion doilars ?
send the money to a number of banks .
in amounts smaii enough not to draw attention .
hey .
why don' t you try and get some sleep .
oh , man !
it' s worse than i thought .
hey , hang on , it' s going to be bumpy .
nicely done !
oh , man .
hey .
are you going to shoot me in the back while i' m driving ?
mr. leeds , please .
yes .
