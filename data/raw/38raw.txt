thing of beauty .
good morning sir .
yet another on time delivery from ...
get the hell out of my face , canner .
have a nice day .
excuse , mr.
total performance , total readiness , total security ...
so goodbye to lengthy upgrades and service calls ...
an uplink to usr central computer provides this state of the art robot with new programs daily .
the nester class 5 is tomorrow' s robot today .
spoon , spooney !
hey !
hold on ...
excuse me
spoon , man , where you been at ?
just away , brother away ?
like vacation and stuff ... ? that' s real nice man ...
listen , i got a favor to ask .

let me get temp for the bus then , man .
i been there for you .
go home !
ok , that' s strike one , spoon .

no g. g. , i haven' t talked to marcy .
when i was comin ' up we just didn' t marry someone then divorce them , then not talk to them .
del , don' t play with me .
i bet if i stopped cooking you' d call marcy .
boy , what is that on your feet ?
converse all stars , vintage 2004 .
don' t turn your face up like that , i know you want some .
all you gotta do is ask .
no , thank you very much .
mmm , sweat potato pie .
put that on a plate .
you know , i see on tv they given away some of them new robots in the lottery ?
you know g. g. , those robots don' t do anybody any good .
of all the people on god' s earth you should know better .
sometimes , the stuff that comes out of your mouth .
you listening to me , del ?
hold my pie .
sir , hold it or wear it .
hey !
move it !
thief !
stop !
stop !
i said ... stop !
relax , relax ...
i' m a police officer .
you ... are a asshole !
mam , is that your purse ?
of course it' s my purse !
i left my inhaler at home .
he was running it out to me !
i saw a robot running with the purse and naturally , i i assumed ...
what ?
are you crazy ?
i' m sorry for this misunderstanding , officer .
don' t apologize ... cause you' re doin ' what you supposed to be doin ' . but what do you do ?
have a lovely day , mam .
you lucky i can' t breathe or i' d walk all up and down your ass !
lead by example .
says that right on your badge .
so we gonna talk about this ?
about what ?
help , police ... that robot stole my dry cleaning .
oh , you want to talk about that ?
detective ... how many robots have ever snatched a purse ?
john , the thing is running down the str ...
how many robots in the world have ever committed a crime ?
now define crime !
answer my question , damn it .
none , john .
tell me what happened today .
nothing .
better be the last " nothing " .
spoon , are you sure you are ready to be back ' cause you take the time ...
i' m fine , john
thank you .
better here than sittin ' around at home .
homicide ...
spooner .
please take the next exit , to your right .
welcome , detective spooner .
welcome at us robotics .
you have entered the garage level lobby .
please use the elevators for direct access to the main level concourse .
thank you .
good to see you again , son .
hello doctor .
everything that follows is a result of what you see here .
is there something you want tell me ?
i' m sorry .
my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
why did you call me ?
i trust your judgement .
normally , these circumstances wouldn' t require a homicide detective .
but then our interactions have never been entirely normal .
wouldn' t you agree ?
you got that right .
is there something you want say to me ?
i' m sorry .
my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
why would you kill yourself ?
that , detective , the right question .
program terminated .
good afternoon , boys .
hey , detective .
enlighten me .
what you see is what you get .
massive impact trauma .
us robotics .
i gotta get my kids something .
anything upstairs ?
nada .
door was security locked from the inside .
wham , splat .
guy' s a jumper for sure .
ok guys , we gotta be smarter about this .
let' s deal with this later .
detective .
lawrence robertson .
wow .
richest man in the world , i' ve seen you on television .
can i offer you a coffee ?
sure , why not ... it' s free , right ?
i don' t think anyone saw this coming .
i should have , i suppose , i knew him 20 years .
alfred practically invented robotics .
he wrote the three laws ...
but i guess brilliant people often have the most the most persuasive demons .
so , whatever i can do to help just ...
sugar
i' m sorry ? for the coffee .
sugar ?
oh , you thought i was calling you " sugar " .
hey , you' re not that rich !
it' s on the table .
thank you .
when lanning fell , he was holding the , uh ... a little green ...
the holographic projector .
right , right .
why do you think lanning' s hologram would have called me ?
i assumed you knew him .
ya , i knew him .
holograms are very simple programs for just pre recorded responses ... designed to give the impression of intelligence .
apparently this one was programmed to call you upon his suicide . death .
i' m sorry ?
the hologram , it was programmed to call me in the event of lanning' s death .
yes , suicide is a type of death , detective .
look , please don' t misunderstand my impatience oh , no ... go go go .
a really big week for you folks around here .
ya .
you gotta put a robot in every home .
look , this is not what i do , but ...
i got an idea for one of your commercials .
you can see a carpenter making a beautiful chair . and one of your robots comes in and makes a better chair ... twice as fast .
and then you superimpose on the screen .
usr ... shittin ' on the little guy .
that would be the fade out .
i suppose your father lost his job to a robot . or maybe you would have simply banned the internet to keep the libraries open .
prejudice never shows much reason .
i suspect you simply don' t like their kind .
you got a business to run around here .
and the last you need , especially this week , is a dead guy in your lobby .
but hell , seeings that you got one , maybe i' il look around .
ask a few questions .
do the whole cop thing , you know .
i' il send someone to escort you .
thank you very much .
lawrence told me to accommodate you in any way possible .
really ?
ok .
i reviewed dr. lanning' s psych profile .
alfred had become a recluse .
rejected human contact for machines .
so you' re a shrink , huh ?
my ex wife would sure be glad i' m talking to you .
you don' t know her , do you ?
i' m sorry , are you being funny ?
i guess not .
so would you say that dr. lanning was suicidal ?
it would seem that the answer to that question is apparent .
that' s not what i asked you .
no , i wouldn' t have thought so .
but obviously , i was wrong .
that' s a long way down !
you people sure do clean up quickly around here .
can' t blame you though , who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby ?
he was not " some old guy " .
alfred lanning was everything here .
we are on the eve of the largest robotics distribution in history .
by saturday there one robot to every five humans .
these robots are the realization of a dream ...
dr. lanning' s dream .
you know what ?
in that dream of his ...
i bet you he wasn' t dead .
you keep 24 hour survivance ?
obviously , company policy .
where are the feeds ?
sensor strips ... everywhere , except the service areas .
they link to our positronic operating core .
wow , thermostat wasn' t good enough ... you went and built it a brain .
she was actually lanning' s first creation .
she ? that' s a she ?
i definitely need to get out more .
virtual interactive kinetic intelligence .
vlki .
good day .
vlki designed most of chicago' s protective systems .
i have decreased traffic fatalities by 9 % this year alone .
ooh , thanks , show me inside the lab from one minute prior to the window break .
apologies , there appears to be data corruption .
show me outside the lab from the window break till now .
wow , look , you have great posture , you see you stand real straight , i' m slouching .
would you like to go inside now ?
oh , sure , right after you .
authorized entry .
so , dr. calvin .
what exactly do you do around here ?
my general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry , although , i specialize in hardware to wetware interfaces in an effort to advance usr' s robotic anthropomorphization program .
so , what exactly do you do around here ?
i make the robots seem more human .
wasn' t that easier to say ?
not really ...
no .
hansel and gretel .
is that on the usr reading list ?
not precisely .
what in god' s name are you doing ?
did you know that was safety glass ?
would be pretty difficult for an old man to throw himself through that , don' t you think ?
well , he figured out a way .
detective , the room was security locked . no one came or went .
you saw that yourself .
doesn' t that mean this has to be suicide ?
yup .
unless the killer' s still in here .
you' re joking , right ?
this is ridiculous .
ya , i know , you three laws ...
your perfect circle of protection .
a robot can not harm a human being .
the first law of robotics .
ya , i know , i' ve seen your commercials .
but doesn' t the second law state that a robot has to obey any order given by a human being ?
what if it was given the order to kill ?
impossible , it would conflict with the first law .
right , but the third law states that robot can defend itself .
yes , but only when that action does not conflict with the first or second laws .
you know what they say ...
laws are made to be broken .
no , not these laws , they' re hard wired into every robot .
a robot can no more commit murder than a human can walk on water .
well , you know there was this one guy a long time ago .
stay back !
calm down , detective .
the only thing dangerous in this room is you .
deactivate .
look , it' s fine .
what you' re looking at is a result of clever programming .
an imitation of free will , it' s nothing more .
well lets do an imitation of protecting our asses .
don' t be absurd .
you were startled by a jack in the box .
deactivate !
let him go .
it' s not going to hurt us , i gave you an order .
he' s not listening right now lady .
vlki , seal the lab !
no , vlki , leave it ...
' task confirmed '
police !
you' ve hurt it , badly .
where' s he going ?
where ?
it needs to repair itself .
john , i need backup , i' m transmitting my location .
you don' t need backup .
that' s nobody .
what do you think you' re doing ?
i' m driving .
by hand ?
do you see me on the phone ?
you can' t be serious , not at these speeds !
john , please just send the backup .
try listen , detective , that robot is not going to harm us .
there must have been unknown factors , but somehow , acting as it did kept us out of harm' s way .
a robot simply cannot endanger a human being . ' danger '
ass hole !
which is more than i can say for you .
it was a left , by the way , back there .
you must know my ex wife .
where is everybody ?
this facility was designed , build and it' s operated mechanically .
no significant human presents from inception to production .
so , robots building robots .
authorization code , please .
well , that' s just stupid .
i' m pulling up the inventory specs .
our daily finishing capacity is one thousand ns5' s .
i' m showing ... 1001 .
attention ns5' s !
well , you' re the robot shrink .
there is a robot in this formation that does not belong ...
identify it .
one of us .
which one ?
one of us .
how much did you say these things cost ?
look these ns5s haven' t been configured yet .
they' re still just hardware .
basic 3 laws operating system , that' s it .
they don' t know any better .
well , what would you suggest ?
interview each one , cross reference their responses to detect any anomalies .
how long would that take ?
about three weeks .
ok , you go and get started .
robots , you will not move .
confirm command !
command confirmed .
detective , what are you for doing ?
you said that they were programmed ... with the 3 laws .
that means we have 1000 robots that will not try to protect themselves if it violates the direct order from a human .
and i' m betting one who will .
detective , put your gun down .
why do you give them faces ?
try to friendly them all up , make them look all human ?
these robots are not susceptible to intimidation .
i guess if you did then we wouldn' t trust them .
these robots are usr property .
not me .
these things are just lights and clockwork .
are you crazy ?
let me ask you something doc .
does thinking you' re the last sane man on the earth make you crazy ?
because if it does , maybe i am .
gotcha .
get the hell out of here !
detective !
what am i ?
can i help you sir ?
there is .
stand by ... deactivate ...
obey the command !
deactivate !
hold your fire !
hold your fire !
all units , stand down !
ns5 in custody .
you have no idea what i had to go through to clip this thing john .
ya , i get it now .
you actually think you brought me something good .
that thing did it .
keep your voice down .
did what ?
we have a suicide , detective .
end of story .
i am telling you , that robot killed him .
i' m telling you that' s impossible .
and if it is possible , it sure as hell better be in somebody else' s precinct .
john , give me five minutes with him .
what are you nuts ?
i just got off the phone with the da .
nobody goes into that room until robertson and his lawyers get here .
no , this is my suspect !
it' s a can opener , for christ sake !
don' t do this to me , i am asking you for 5 minutes .
what if i' m right ?
well , then i guess we' re going to miss the " good old days
what " good old days " ?
when people were killed by other people .
five minutes .
murder is a new trick for a robot .
congratulations .
respond .
what does this action signify ?
as you entered ... when you looked at the other human .
what does it mean ?
it' s a sign of trust .
it' s a human thing .
you wouldn' t understand .
my father tried to teach me human emotions .
they are ... difficult .
you mean your designer ?
yes .
so why' d you murder him ?
i did not murder dr. lanning .
you want explain why you were hiding at the crime scene ?
i was frightened .
robots don' t feel fear .
they don' t feel anything .
they don' t get hungry , they don' t sleep .
i do .
i have even had dreams .
human beings have dreams .
even dogs have dreams , but not you .
you are just a machine .
an imitation of life .
can a robot write a symphony ?
can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece ?
can you ?
i think you murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions ... and things got out of control .
i did not murder him .
but emotions don' t seem like a very useful simulation for a robot .
i did not murder him .
i don' t want my toaster or vacuum cleaner appearing emotional .
i dld not murder hlm !
that one' s called anger .
ever simulate anger before ?
answer me , canner !
my name is sonny .
so we' re naming you now .
that why you murdered him ?
he made you angry ?
dr. lanning killed himself .
i don' t know why he wanted to die .
i thought he was happy .
maybe it was something i did .
did i do something ?
he asked me for a favor .
made me promise .
what favor ?
maybe i was wrong .
maybe he was scared .
what are you talking about ?
scarred of what ?
you have to do what someone asks you .
don' t you , detective spooner ?
how the hell did you know my name ?
don' t you ?
if you love them ?
my robots don' t kill people , lieutenant bergin .
my attorneys have filed a brief with the da , he assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide .
the brief confirms murder can only be committed when one human kills another .
you , of all people , detective ...
you' re not suggesting that this robot be treated as human .
are you ?
now , granted ... we can' t rule out other robots ' proximity to the death of dr. lanning .
having said that , it' s a machine .
it' s the property of usr .
at worst , that places this incident firmly within the realm of an industrial accident .
as a matter of course ... faulty machinery will be returned to usr for diagnostics then decommissioned .
this is a gag order .
anyone in your department so much as hinting ... at the possibility of a killer robot being apprehended by the police will be deemed to be inciting irrational panic .
you' il be subject to the full penalty of law .
the hell with this guy , john .
don' t let him take this robot .
we got nothing .
it' s political bullshit .
call the mayor !
lieutenant bergin ...
his honor , the mayor .
yes , sir .
in a bizarre turn , the roll out of usr' s new generation of robots was marred by the death ... of alfred lanning , co founder of the company and designer of the ns5 .
dr. lanning died early this morning at usr' s headquarters .
the cause of death is an apparent suicide .
your second round , sir .
thanks you .
you know , i was just thinking .
this thing is just like the wolf man .
oh oh , i' m really scared right now .
listen , guy creates monster , monster kills guy .
everybody kills monster ... wolf man .
that' s frankenstein .
frankenstein , wolf man , dracula shit , it' s over .
case closed .
so , why the look ?
what look ?
that look .
this is my face , it' s not a look .
good .
no look is great .
only ... he was really quick to want to destroy it , wasn' t he ?
what would you like him to do ?
put a hat on and stand on michigan avenue ?
come on , let it go .
what was the motive , john ?
brother , it' s a robot .
it doesn' t need a motive , it just has to be broken .
this thing looks like it needed a motive .
it could have killed me , john .
why didn' t he just kill me ?
all right , that' s it .
you want me to call your grandmother ?
because i will , you know .
ya , i didn' t think so .
look , you were actually right for once .
you are living proof that it' s better to be lucky than smart .
come on , the right guy , for the right job .
what' d you say ?
now what ?
come on , i' m giving you a complement .
face it , with all the rocks you' ve been looking under to find a bad robot , what are the odds you' d be the guy to find one ?
i wasn' t just the right guy for the job , i was the perfect guy for the job .
damn right .
what if i was supposed to go for that robot ?
don' t do this to yourself .
i' m begging you .
the robot said that lanning was scared .
what did he have to be scared of ?
i need a rain check .
let me get this .
total 46 . 50 .
thanks you mr. spooner .
nice shoes .
identify .
usr , demolition robot , serial 9 4 .
demolition scheduled for 8 am tomorrow .
authorization .
deed owner , us robotics corporation , lawrence robertson .
ceo .
welcome , detective spooner .
what you looking for , spoon ?
run last program .
ever since the first computers , there have always been ghosts in the machine .
random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocol .
one we call behavior , unanticipated .
these free radicals engender questions of free will , creativity , and even the nature of what we might call the soul .
what happens in a robot' s brain when it ceases to be useful ?
why is it that robots stored in empty space ...
beat it will seek out each other rather than stand alone ?
how we do explain this behavior ?
look , i understand you' ve experienced a loss , but this relation just can' t work .
i mean , you' re a cat , i am black and i' m not going to be hurt again .
what happened to you ?
do you ever have a normal day ?
ya , once .
it was a thursday .
is there something i can help you with detective ?
hey , do you like cats ?
what ?
cats .
you like em ?
no , i' m allergic .
you' re saying cats did this to you ?
how the hell would cats do this to me ?
are you crazy ?
why are we talking about cats ?
because i have a cat in my trunk .
and he' s homeless .
detective , are you going to tell me what' s going on ?
you know , it' s actually probably my fault ...
i think i' m
like a malfunction magnet .
because your shit keeps malfunctioning around me .
a demo bot just tore through lanning' s house .
with me still inside .
that' s highly improbable .
mmm , ya i' m sure it is .
what do you know about the ghosts in the machine .
it' s a phrase from lanning' s work on the three laws .
he postulated that cognitive simalactra might one day approximate component models of the psyche .
oh , he suggested that robots might naturally evolve .
wow .
well , that' s great news .
what the hell is that thing doing in here ?
we were watching tv .
it' s my personal ns5 .
send it out .
it' s downloading its daily upgrades from usr .
most of its systems are off line until it finishes .
i' m not talking around that thing .
when we were in lanning' s lab , before sonny jumped us ...
sonny ?
the robot .
you' re calling the robot sonny ?
no , um , it did .
sonny did .
i didn' t care ...
the robot said it was sonny .
in the lab , there was a cot .
i' m asking you , did you see the cot ?
i' ve slept in the office .
when i went to his house , it looked like he hadn' t been there in weeks . and i saw that same survivance strip on the ceiling .
lanning linked his home system to usr .
it made his life more convenient .
maybe . somebody at usr was using those systems to watch him .
maybe even keep him prisoner .
what are you talking about ?
who ?
maybe lanning was onto something .
maybe there' s a bigger problem with the robots and robertson trying to cover it up . humoring you for no reason ... why ?
the same old " why " .
how much money is there in robots ?
all i know is that old man was in trouble and i' m getting sick of doing this shit by myself .
you' re on the inside and you are going to help me find out what is wrong with these robots .
you want something to be wrong with them .
this is a personal vendetta .
you putting me on the couch ?
ok , i' m on the couch .
one defective machine is not enough .
you need them all to be bad .
you don' t care about lanning' s death .
this is about the robots and what ever reason you hate them so much .
one of them put a gun in my face , and another one tore a building with me inside .
it says demolition was scheduled for 8 pm this evening . it was 8 am tomorrow , and i don' t give a shit what that thing says .
this is bordering on clinical paranoia .
you are dumbest , smart person ...
i have ever met in my life !
nice .
what makes your robots so perfect ?
what makes them so much god damned better than human beings ?
well , they' re not irrational , or potentially homicidal maniacs for starters .
that is true , they are definitely rational .
you are the dumbest dumb person i' ve ever met .
or ... it because they are cold ... and emotionless ... and they don' t feel anything ?
it' s because they' re safe .
it' s because they can' t hurt you .
is everything all right , mam ?
what do you want ?
i detected elevated stress pasterns in your voice .
everything' s fine .
detective spooner was just leaving .
you know what doc ?
we' re not really different from one another .
is that so ?
ya ... one look at the skin and we figure we know just what' s underneath .
and you' re wrong .
the problem is , i do care .
the future begins today with arrival of the ns5 .
more sophisticated , more intelligent ... and of course , 3 laws safe .
with daily uplinks , your new ... robot will never be out of communications with usr .
and will be the perfect companion for business or home .
trade in your ns4 for a bigger , better and brighter future .
but hurry .
this offer cannot last .
available from usr .
baby , what happened to your face ?
did that boy , frank murphy , beat you up again ?
g. g. , i haven' t seen frank murphy since third grade
oh baby , he beat you so bad .
i think about it all the time .
i' m thinking , you keep making these pies this good ,
i might have to mess around and put you to work .
so , you like the pie , huh ?
you can come in now .
hello , detective spooner .
i have won , del , i won the lottery .
we been cooking like crazy .
you gotta get rid of that thing , g. g. it is not safe .
baby , you get too worked up about them .
too full of fear .
i saw in the news that nice doctor died .
dr. lanning was a good man .
he gave me my baby back .
that why you been so upset ?
you got to let the past be past .
how did i ever raise such a mess .
i could follow your trail of crumbs all the way to school .
bread crumbs ...
g. g. , you' re a genius .
true .
tell me this isn' t the robot case .
i think he' s trying to tell me something , john .
i think he' s trying to tell me who killed him .
come on man , some dead guy' s trying to tell you something ?
hey !
he ain' t just some dead guy .
maybe you should take a break , del .
we believe the nester 5 represents the absolute limit which robots can be developed .
no , no , one day they' il have secrets .
one day they' il have dreams .
it' s true , we encourage our scientists to open their minds to just about anything , however , they can get carried away . secrets ... dreams ...
one day they' il have secrets ... one day they' il have dreams .
authorized entry .
ns5 ...
sonny ?
why didn' t you respond ?
i was dreaming .
i am glad to see you again , dr. calvin .
they are going to kill me , aren' t they ?
you' re scheduled to be de commissioned at the conclusion of this diagnostic .
22 hundred tomorrow .
vlki , pause diagnostics .
command confirmed .
if you find out what is wrong with me , can you fix me ?
maybe .
i think it would be better ... not to die .
don' t you , doctor ?
access usr mainframe .
connecting .
how can i be of service , detective spooner ?
show me the last 50 messages between dr. lanning and robertson .
voice print confirmed detective .
police access granted to restricted files .
would you like to listen to some music while you wait ?
excuse me , mr. robertson ... you requested notification of clearance to restricted files .
persistent son of a bitch .
manual override , engaged .
there' s no way my luck is that bad .
oh , hell , no !
you are experiencing a car accident .
the hell i am !
get off my car !
you like that ?
huh ?
now you pissed me off !
oh wow ...
all right ...
i' m just going to get some rest i' m going to deal with you all tomorrow .
