the characters and events depicted in this motion picture are real .
they are based on the stories of veterans and military history .
second lieutenant jrv , is the strike group ready ?
yes , we are .
i' il wait for your return with emergency troops .
the soviets ' base " the bird " must be beaten .
it' s a formidable base but i have faith in you and lieutenant jrv .
i want a prisoner , alive .
good luck .
good luck .
those boys have a tough night ahead of them .
we' il dig forward .
i don' t know where the guards are .
no movement above the snow !
beyond the front llne
welcome .
harry jrv' s home , stockholm december 6th , 2003
so you' re jeanette ?
jeanette eriksson .
orvar nilsson .
we' re off to the finnish embassy .
it' s their independence day .
orvar helped us in the winter and continuation wars .
that was a long time ago .
come in .
this is a soviet war map .
is it a spoil of war , harry ?
in summer of 1941 we took back the karelian peninsula .
as you can see , the syvri river flows from lake onega towards lake ladoga .
during the war there were two swedish speaking regiments .
i arrived at the base " the dam " in early june 1942 .
the front was quiet .
we had to get information about the enemy' s intentions with reconnaissance missions .
this clay is hard like cement !
help is coming .
forss , you got a package .
take cover !
the dam " , syvri river , june 1942
fire in the hole !
there' s major hedengren .
you' ve made a lot of progress .
tnt helps the digging .
where the hell did you get it ?
we shouldn' t waste our supplies !
we took it from the soviets ' mine fields .
very well then .
that swede listens to reason .
you' re married to your camera .
do you sleep with it ?
i don' t use it in my sleep .
next week i' il take it with me to " the boil .
can i come along ?
sure .
we' il give that base hell .
the commanders don' t like it so close to our lines .
the boil " is almost next to the " teeri " base .
why were we chosen ?
i' ve been there before .
what' s that ?
an old boot leg .
i' il carry the camera with it .
at " boil " we have our hands full .
the boil " , july 4th , 1942
we' il split into small groups and attack all the posts simultaneously .
our artillery will provide cover fire for one minute .
follow me .
we' il need a lot of grenades and charges .
forss , hndig , bergroth .
take a photo of me leaving .
now !
is everybody here ?
no wounded ?
something' s wrong .
where are those damn russkies ?
it' s too quiet !
russkies !
we' il bring the wounded .
good .
we destroyed nine of the ten posts .
good .
the last one remained .
the russkies struck back .
they have about thirty casualties .
two of us were slightly wounded .
well done !
you' il get an extra leave .
give me a list tomorrow .
you call this a pot ?
you won' t win the war with toys .
it would' ve been worse if forss hadn' t seen the russkies .
i had no idea what happened further back .
our artillery didn' t know the russkies were so close .
you started the attack before the last grenades fell .
the last grenades came too late .
i don' t know what went wrong .
watches were synchronised .
we were very lucky .
but do we need artillery support ?
what do you mean ?
we could sneak into their positions instead of attacking .
then the battle would be fought on our terms .
sounds unusual and nerve racking but it' s worth a try .
the risk of exposure diminishes if the group is smaller .
not a bad idea , allan .
hedengren talked about furlough .
that' d be nice .
that swede is ok .
it' s bold to come here voluntarily from safe sweden .
there should be more than hndig and hedengren .
our neighbour , ir 13 , has an entire company , 140 men .
volunteers , yes .
but the official view of sweden ...
there' ve been signs .
a friend of mine from helsinki is in the 11th division .
he told me what he saw last year at smjrvi .
that officer has a soviet uniform .
is he a pow ?
what ?
he' s a lieutenant colonel in the swedish army .
oh , really ?
it' s about time sweden joined us .
your royal highness .
this road goes to lake onega and petroskoi .
the main road here goes to aunus and lake ladoga .
a 100 kilometres away .
your royal highness " , he said .
a real royal !
i recognised him from a magazine .
it' s prince gustaf adolf .
you have a fancy passenger .
a prince .
he dares to come this close to the line .
what' s he doing here ?
you can ask someone else .
but he' s well informed .
i heard him talking to colonel .
he had a hard time answering all the questions .
and that prince is no sissy .
he wanted to volunteer for the winter war but his grandfather , the king , wouldn' t let him .
that' s understandable .
but he did let the prince come here .
you remember that ?
in march .
it was reported in the newspapers .
headquarters , mikkeli .
march 1942 of the brave finns and you , field marshal .
to show our appreciation my grandfather
his majesty king gustaf , stows upon you a knighthood and a first class grand cross .
the finnish people have never wanted war .
but neither did we hesitate to take arms to defend our country .
the swedish royal family knows that we weren' t born yesterday .
mannerheim said that this is finland' s war .
i wanted to go to leningrad but he refused to attack , twice !
hitler was furious .
we happen to have the same enemy .
the winter war was worse .
we fought the russkies and germans .
when mannerheim turned 75 hitler paid him a visit .
think about it .
mannerheim , who is a lot taller than hitler marching fast .
quiet .
the news .
headquarters announced that one of our attack patrols invaded the enemy positions and destroyed almost ten enemy posts .
thirty enemy soldiers were killed ...
that' s you .
jrv' s patrol made the news .
tomorrow i' il go to officer training .
us young officers are too lenient with you rascals .
it' il change when i come back .
ok , sir !
shut your pie hole !
is it any good ?
you finally came back .
did you do well in the training ?
you have a little tan .
nothing' s changed here .
what was the training like ?
what i expected .
what the hell ... ?
hi , harry !
what was the training like ?
was it bad ?
whose are these ?
that' s mine .
there are other guns in similar condition .
commanders pressure subordinates and me too and you just lie here !
i' m gone for two weeks and everything is a mess !
they tried to force us to become more disciplined .
like in peacetime .
but we didn' t give a damn .
no one has to be toady to me .
but the russkies may come any time so the guns have to be ready !
inspection in ten minutes .
slobs get extra guard duty .
frilund too !
this happens if you' re not diligent .
we proceeded undetected into enemy territory and acted fast .
we dominated the battle the whole time .
this is routine .
but now we have a prisoner .
i heard that you asked when they want the prisoner .
saturday at the latest !
we fulfilled our mission and took a prisoner .
there were no casualties .
the same with the jaegers .
thanks , harry .
well done .
you' ve done almost thirty missions .
this one went well too .
they' ve mostly been recon missions .
but there were too many of us .
nine or ten would be enough .
we could discreetly attack the enemy bases .
i heard that !
you have a point .
how did you prepare for the attack ?
for three nights we observed them , learnt their routines .
lieutenant colonel , who ... ?
my name' s marttinen .
i wanted this prisoner .
i' m the division chief of staff .
soon i' il be your regiment commander .
i' il try to speak swedish , at least with the rank and file .
we' il be seeing each other a lot .
von wilcken !
ask the prisoner for his name and unit .
his name is kungurchev .
his unit is ir 1061 .
infantry regiments 61 and 1061 ?
you see !
they outnumber us by a thousand .
we' il do fine .
good guys .
i think we' il get along .
interpreter , take the prisoner .
hq of the regiment staff , 1942
why is it written in swedish ?
you do know finnish , captain taxell .
ir 61 is swedish speaking .
everything is written in swedish .
you' re right , captain .
you studied at bo akademi university ?
could you get me a textbook ?
my swedish is a little rusty .
gladly , sir .
everything ok ?
it' s peaceful .
my shift ends in thirty minutes ...
help me !
here i am again .
good .
you came back .
you got a package .
i found something in vaasa .
did you have fun ?
hi , guys !
greetings from vaasa .
you came back .
how' s it going ?
well ...
franzn got killed .
a sniper shot him in the mouth when he was on guard duty .
franzn too ...
jrv brought a new pot .
we have to take care of that sniper .
i talked with our headmaster in vaasa .
he said we should use our " free time " for educating ourselves .
he thought of us ?
ragnar krook is a fine man .
he suggested correspondence courses .
you can do your homework here .
he' il test you later .
i have some exercises with me .
i' il be your instructor .
we don' t have enough lamp oil for reading at night .
wait .
the russkies left a lot of phone cable behind .
we' ve done some experiments .
look at this .
look at that .
not bad .
just don' t burn the dug out .
it' s been peaceful .
i' il get some sleep .
get up , guys !
our country is calling for your services !
the coffee substitute is ready !
shut your pie hole , forss .
gimme your mess kit , you' il wake up .
what the hell did you make ?
cat pee ?
don' t swear so much .
it' s nasty .
everything' s getting worse .
don' t drink that shit .
it' s better to have tea .
is it quiet ?
yes .
good .
stop !
password !
spruce ...
twigs .
correct .
i' m reverend hgstrm .
i wanted to meet you soldiers at " the dam " .
welcome .
thank you .
good evening .
how' s it going in here ?
nothing new .
please , sit .
kaustinen !
make some substitute for the reverend .
a lot of grounds here .
what the hell ?
a foot cloth !
no wonder it' s tasted like shit all week .
here you are , reverend .
thank you .
i' ve visited many bases but none like this .
you' ve worked hard with the trenches , dug outs and forts .
this looks really great .
the russkies won' t get through easily .
but soldiers also need free time .
nobody can take this for too long .
they need some counterbalance .
some of the guys and i read and study .
sderman is studying for his a levels .
i' d go crazy without books .
you' re studying in these circumstances ?
yes , reverend .
jrv arranged it with our headmaster .
some don' t care for culture .
they sleep whenever they can .
young man , you have a fine camaraderie here .
good luck to you all .
i hope the lord protects you .
thank you for the refreshments .
thank you for coming .
what does this word , " danger " , mean ?
it means jeopardy .
if it' s really dangerous you can say " peril " .
the british have a lot of words .
look them up and you' il learn .
odd .
looking them up ?
no , studying english whilst they' ve declared war on us .
what a joke .
soon only brazil will not be at war against us .
but the gentlemanly british ...
it' s understandable .
they fight against the germans and we threaten their supply lines .
bertel , i' il read you an excerpt of english at its best .
that' s " peril " for you .
what did it mean ?
something like this .
only noble finland , even in the jaws of peril "
shows what free men can do .
sounds wonderful .
who said that ?
guess .
our " enemy " churchill .
during the winter war .
we both know that we still fight against the same enemy .
some old veterans are allowed to go to home .
but even you new guys should take guard duty seriously .
the russkies are close so be watchful .
how close , sir ?
you don' t have to call me that here .
their defensive perimeter runs behind that hill .
it was relatively quiet but now they' re hitting us with 60 grenades a day , at noon .
what do we do then ?
take cover in the dug out .
the guards remain at their posts .
snipers are the worst .
don' t show yourself needlessly .
many men have died here .
their snipers are good at what they do .
someone' s coming .
the platoon' s second in command forss .
he' il take a last look , he' s going to officers ' school .
it' s time .
i guess there' s not much to say .
thanks for everything .
thanks , lasse .
i' m happy for you but i know what i' m losing .
kaustinen is a good replacement .
we both know it .
i hope you can take care of that sniper .
he' s killed far too many .
trust me .
we' il deal with that bastard .
hang tight .
hang tight , boys !
lasse !
you should stop smoking .
it' s bad for your health .
you just watch for the flying lead .
nicotine is my problem !
bye bye !
that was today' s lesson .
don' t you have any more hand grenades ?
i' il get you more .
that was the sniper .
oh , yeah ?
he wasn' t good enough .
i' il go to see marttinen .
i won' t be long .
come in .
i' m sorry , you looked like dbeln first .
it' s nothing .
the bullet just scratched me .
sit down .
i' il get straight to the point .
we haven' t been able to destroy the russian base " bird " .
another regiment tried to destroy it in march 1942 in vain .
two companies , engineers and jaegers attacked in snow and open terrain .
it was insane !
they didn' t get anywhere .
19 were killed and dozens wounded .
i heard about it .
it' il be different now .
second lieutenant jrv you' il get the first chance .
i believe in you .
do you have enough volunteers ?
more than enough .
ten men is enough .
the rest can be support troops .
good .
let me know when your group is ready .
i' il issue specific orders about strike groups and cover fire .
you know that " bird " is strong .
they have at least two platoons , three machine guns and mortars .
ok , boys .
i promised marttinen you' d come along .
we' il leave at 1830 hours .
heln leads one group , nordman the other .
we can trust them .
even the battalion commander got involved .
guess what i was ordered ?
only i can have a submachine gun , the rest get rifles .
we can' t afford to lose ten submachine guns . " asshole !
a submachine gun and three hand grenades for everyone .
frnde , make sure we have piled up charges .
i know where to put one .
up the major' s ass !
you won' t see him there .
but lieutenant colonel marttinen seems to like it there .
form a row , i' il take a picture .
where' s backholm ?
sleeping .
let him sleep .
it' s going to be a rough night .
bjrk , move closer so everybody fits in the photo .
good .
there' s a guard ahead .
let' s go right .
the bird " , february 8th and 9th , 1943
there' s a guard too .
let' s try the middle .
it' s past midnight .
we' ve been here for five hours .
it can' t be helped .
my leg has frostbite .
i' il rub it .
no , go back .
let the medic take care of it .
there' s a machine gun here .
you' il secure the rear .
finholm , fagerstrm , frnde , come with me .
there it is !
it' s unmanned that' s the way they are .
let' s blow it up .
that was a stove hatch .
now we know where they are .
the russkies are on the left .
stay here to cover us .
that' s the main dug out .
lieutenant , fire artillery barrage .
understood , sir !
goddamn assholes !
grenades !
don' t be afraid !
greetings from the white bandits !
hurry !
reinforcements may be on the way .
grenades here !
die , finnish scum !
greetings to mannerheim !
i' il show you , bandits !
you' re gonna get it !
more russkies !
they won' t surrender .
use a charge !
help ...
my leg ...
we' re about ready , is everyone here ?
you ok ?
a few pieces of shrapnels in my leg .
nothing serious .
good .
let' s go or the whole red army will be on our tail .
tough russkies , nobody surrendered .
take him with you .
stretcher !
he was hit in the lungs .
you got lucky , ragnar .
we' il see you soon .
hey , jrv .
aren' t you ever afraid ?
i' m sometimes really afraid .
of course i' m afraid .
no normal 20 year old wants to die .
in battle i feel a knot in my stomach .
it' s not paralysing fear but adrenaline surging into my brain .
it makes me 100 % effective .
but some react differently .
they freeze or run away scared .
fear must be controlled .
you know how .
otherwise i wouldn' t take you with me .
of course i' m sometimes afraid .
but not as much when jrv is with us .
here they come !
his name is nikolai smirnov .
take him to the first aid station quickly .
he is valuable .
if he stays alive .
we' il go to the dug out .
wait .
we carried him and now he' s dead .
it wasn' t exactly his fault .
let' s take him inside .
they can bury him .
klas ...
i' ve been thinking .
strange .
smirnov shot me in the lungs four months ago .
now he' s dead .
and you' re very much alive !
do you hear ?
the russkies ' time signal is as punctual as ...
ragnar !
is anyone else wounded ?
how did they hit such a small hole ?
stretchers .
i' il immortalise one corner of our great dwelling .
stay there so the photo looks more life like .
sit at the end of the table , kaustinen .
try to look like you' re learning something .
sderman , sit and look into the camera .
you can show your girl what good conditions you have here .
i' m not in the mood today .
don' t move .
why are you sulking on such a beautiful day ?
the girl i told you about the other day ...
i got a letter from her .
she' s not my girl .
did she break it off ?
it didn' t even start .
sounds bad .
let' s leave him alone .
i' m sorry .
captain .
the army corps ordered us to increase our patrols .
tell lieutenants jrv and mattas to come here .
yes , sir .
we' re on time .
i wonder what' s so important .
who knows ?
soon we' il find out .
lieutenant colonel .
at ease !
sit down .
gentlemen , we received new general orders .
every company must send one recon or strike patrol to the front line every day .
jrv , you' il be the regiment' s patrol leader .
mattas is your deputy .
the jaeger company has other duties .
questions ?
i' ve only used volunteers in my patrols .
are we supposed to patrol for others as well ?
i' m not asking that .
you can assign men from other units if you want .
it' s your business if you want to do others ' work .
that' s all .
good luck and thank you .
you may return to your units .
one moment .
thank you .
we have a lot of work ahead of us .
true .
marttinen is breathing down our necks .
you know why ?
he wants us to be battle ready .
forts and patrols are for that .
indeed .
he won' t let us become lazy .
we must be vigilant and earn the enemy' s respect .
it' s good for morale .
but it means casualties .
exactly .
he doesn' t think the price is too high .
the dam " , jrv .
taxell here .
marttinen wants you to recon a russian base next to 2nd battalion .
and a prisoner .
will you do it ?
the boys at 2nd scouted the place .
ok .
it must be planned well .
i want details of their defences .
i' il speak to my colleagues .
i' il get back to you .
over .
can i come along ?
sure .
we work well together .
i' il come along .
ok .
yes ?
can i come along ?
can i come along ?
welcome .
this' il be a good strike group .
seven men is enough .
we' il go to 2nd battalion to get to know the situation .
just a few hours left ...
don' t worry , bertel .
it' il go well , you' il see .
damn bedbugs !
what are you reading ?
show me .
history of philosophy .
you' ve read it thoroughly .
it' s a good book .
socrates .
plato .
i want to read this .
of course .
plato is overrated .
a metaphysicist and a speculative philosopher .
quit lecturing and turn off the light .
we want to sleep .
soon .
in plato' s model society individuals had no rights .
the role of literature was to idolise the powers that be .
plato' s society has now come to pass with stalin and hitler .
really ?
we weren' t taught that .
aristotle is much better .
his thinking is based on reality .
but he did make mistakes .
he said that nordic people are brave in war but dumb in the head .
that' s his opinion of us .
now we should sleep .
lf it' s possible .
the battle begins here .
jrv and his men go in , major tirronen fires the artillery .
thank you , lieutenant mangs .
you know your mission .
i want a prisoner .
your other task is to crush the base " sea " .
i' m counting on you to do your best .
i' il be around until the mission is over .
let' s take a picture .
did you notice that sderman has grown ten centimetres ?
laugh all you want .
napoleon was small and a corporal too .
we can' t go forward .
let' s try another way .
this is a good spot .
take a break .
it' s too quiet .
it' s three o' clock already .
we have to wait for the evening breeze .
heln , finholm .
finally you' re here !
i came at once .
what now ?
someone was standing there !
there !
no one' s there .
calm down .
there is !
i saw a face !
you saw a ghost .
he' s nervous .
damn , they don' t believe me !
what' s the time ?
three on the dot .
mission began 18 hours ago .
i guess i dare to smoke one .
or do i ?
not moving for four hours and thinking of smoking was hard .
damn !
i have to quit this .
my word of honour .
when we beat " the sea " i' il smoke no more !
i promise .
get up , boys .
time to get busy .
harry !
sderman !
no ...
jrv , i' m hit !
leave if you can !
boys !
kaustinen and i are wounded !
can you make it ?
yes , i can .
allan , grenade !
can you make it ?
you understand ?
walk to the first aid station .
stman !
that way .
no prisoner this day either .
yeah .
we have casualties : one dead and seven wounded .
the sea " was destroyed but we have no prisoner .
the russkies fought hard .
about thirty of them were killed .
i thank you all and the strike group .
the wounded will receive good treatment .
lieutenant , come to report at my hq at noon .
yes , sir .
no one has died for me before .
and sderman of all people ...
he sacrificed himself for me .
the law of war is hard .
but it' s not your fault .
mangs , take a picture of heln and me .
sure .
press there .
that' s sderman' s box .
the small one .
listen to what sderman wrote .
if i get killed , i want to die like a finnish soldier .
and he did .
fire !
our last respects to our brave comrade in arms "
corporal bertel sderman .
rest in peace .
your friends at the front .
dear friends and family of bertel sderman .
my talented young student had his whole life ahead of him .
but destiny decided otherwise .
even in grim circumstances bertel remained humane .
and he was also a brave soldier .
there is no greater sacrifice than giving his life for his comrades .
now we' il carry his memory with us which is as bright as the marble in the ballroom of the school .
his name will be engraved in it where it will shine for the following generations .
i' ve lost so many great boys .
what are your plans ?
no matter how the war ends .
i don' t know .
i' ve enquired about degree requirements from the university .
you' ve always been interested in everything .
good luck , my friend .
thank you , headmaster .
you know your mission .
take a prisoner and recon in the russkie hinterland .
good luck .
strike groups !
mines !
we' il stop here .
lindblad , go further back with olof and kanckos .
we' il try capturing a lone russkie .
it must be done in silence .
no gun fire !
capturing many is too risky .
we' re too far behind the lines .
let them go .
we would have to fire .
look at those clothes .
next time someone says that russkies have bad uniforms , i' il beat them !
no more russkies , i guess .
let' s go home and continue tomorrow .
harry !
don' t move !
it' s clear now .
ufa !
you must leave me here .
go on !
there' s no point in you staying here !
jrv hit a mine .
dammit , boys !
we can' t leave him even if he ordered us .
i' m going back .
as i was laying there i thought about books
i hadn' t read yet .
i thought of all the pretty girls i' d never get to see ...
and i felt that it was unreasonable to die at the age of 22 .
i ordered you to go .
you told us about the three musketeers .
one for all and all for one .
how are you ?
can you walk ?
good !
we' il take jrv .
and nordstrm .
switch !
how are you , lindblad ?
just a flesh wound .
i can help you .
klockars !
check if they need help .
yes , sir !
give him water .
let' s go .
does anyone know their blood type ?
mine' s o.
good .
you' il donate blood .
how are you , lindblad ?
nothing serious ?
no , sir .
i' il be ok soon .
good .
i need men like you .
that was fast , boys .
thank you .
sit down .
giving blood is no easy task .
i feel dizzy .
how is jrv ?
he came to after three bottles of plasma .
and a hefty dose of my blood .
you can be proud , corporal .
thank you , lieutenant .
thank you for everything .
you' il make it .
i spent a long time at the hospital .
the wound didn' t heal and had to be operated on many times .
st gran' s hospital , may 1944
you got mail .
from my regiment commander .
nice .
he still remembers me .
it' s been nine months already .
how are you feeling ?
ok .
a soldier' s hand , foot and life can be taken .
may lord protect this land , that is all i want .
thus sang a soldier begging for money in ensign stl .
he didn' t feel sorry for his lost leg .
our country is what mattered the most .
you have that same courage .
you' ve shown it in spades .
your work is done , your duty fulfilled .
i am proud of you .
remember to write to us .
if you need something , we' il do our best to help you .
your comrade , lieutenant colonel alpo marttinen .
soon you' il walk with a prosthetic limb .
we' il transfer you to salsta castle .
baroness wera von essen has set up a convalescence home for finnish soldiers .
reconnaissance division june 7th , 1944 , stockholm
i' d like to speak to engineer lieutenant nils erik stenbck .
stenbck .
hi , nils erik .
it' s curt wennberg .
hq' s reconnaissance division , mikkeli
how are you ?
i' il speak candidly .
what the devil are you doing ?
the russkies have 24 divisions ready for attack .
twenty four ?
cannons and tanks side by side .
and more motorised units are coming .
the attack may start at anytime and you' re not even practising !
unbelievable .
i just wanted to warn you .
not exactly good news , curt .
but thanks .
a lot .
ketonen , dammit !
even the swedes know the russians are launching a major offensive .
looks like it .
they' ve concentrated more troops than we anticipated .
i wrote in the report that a major offensive may start any day .
we' il see if the big boys like it .
you can' t do that .
you know general airo' s orders .
mannerheim is not to be unnerved .
it doesn' t change the facts .
sounds horrible .
it' s the real deal in karelia now .
believe me , boys .
we won' t get old here .
61 is heading west soon .
you almost hope for it .
what the hell are we doing here if helsinki is under threat ?
vyborg fell suddenly on june 20th which caused a threat .
if russkies had crossed the strait they would' ve gotten to helsinki .
instead they stopped at vyborg to celebrate their victory .
ir 61 was ordered to assume command of tienhaara .
marttinen understood what was at stake .
he told his men over and over again that tienhaara was finland' s lock .
and he was determined to keep it locked .
we' re getting close .
we' il arrive in about thirty minutes .
the company will march to tienhaara .
expect artillery and aerial attacks .
the boys shouldn' t march in too tight a formation .
look at this map .
salsta castle .
june 10th , 1944

it hasn' t even healed properly .
perhaps .
and it' s driving me crazy !
my place is at the front .

questions ?
the first companies arrive shortly .

the 3rd battalion commander says that the russkies have broken through at kivisilta .
thank you .
you can go back .
wessberg !
the russkies must be beaten !
here' s an order for major holmberg .
how many assault guns will support us ?

you two go to major holmberg with this order .
but on separate routes .
understood ?
yes , sir .
medics !
sir , an order from the commander .
thank you .
listen , boys !
one or two platoons have broken through at kivisilta .
they must be stopped .
use assault guns in counterattack .
an energetic officer must lead it to make it work .
it must be done swiftly .
reserves must be used without compunction .
marttinen .
lfman , you' il strike back with the 11th company .
our artillery and two assault guns will lay down cover fire .
it' s ok .
good luck .
thank you , sir .
11th company , follow me !

medic !

a call from headquarters to the commander of ir 61 .
this is the commander in chief .
lieutenant colonel marttinen , sir field marshal !
do you have the situation under control , lieutenant colonel ?
tienhaara will hold , sir .
tienhaara will hold ...
i thank you ...
colonel .
relay my thanks to the regiment .
our country is saved ... for now .
thank you , sir field marshal .
over .
hello .
congratulations , colonel .
the russkies have had enough for now .
but the price was too high .
i lost hundreds of men .
five company commanders died today .
there are only 38 men left in the 11th company .
war is hard .
colonel , i heard you were promoted .
congratulations .
thank you , lieutenant .
but in all honesty i have to say that this battle was won mainly because of the artillery .
tell that to your regiment .
shouldn' t you rest , colonel ?
it' s quieter now .
no .
i must go to the front line to thank the men .
marshal' s orders .
soldiers !
it' s been a tough day .
we will never see many of our comrades again .
and even more were wounded .
but i' m very proud of you .
our commander in chief field marshal mannerheim personally asked me to thank you , men of ir 61 .
because of you he promoted me to colonel .
no russkies who came here remained alive .
you also , lieutenant lillandt , have been promoted .
congratulations , captain .
remember what i said , boys !
tienhaara is finland' s lock .
i rely on you .
the marshal relies on us !
do you think that the troops will hold ?
yes , colonel .
the foxholes are the best place to be .
we' il be ok if the artillery is as good as today .
if there' s enough munitions and bread and other food too .
thanks , captain .
i' il make sure you' il get all you need .
we cannot retreat unless there' s peace .
if we want to save our lives and our nation .
what did he want ?
nothing special .
he gave a speech to the boys .
during the days and weeks in tienhaara
ir 61 lost 820 men .
but the finnish lock and the road to helsinki remained closed .
a few weeks after that
finland' s independence was at stake every day .
after tienhaara , the red army tried to win the war at tali lhantala .
the largest battle of the nordic countries was fought there .
