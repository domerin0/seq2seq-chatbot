nothing here ?
check the other one !
gently !
still nothing ?
we need more sap .
look out below !
now what ?
look higher up .
towards the left !
we don' t have much time left .
i found some good .
lift all of that up to me !
i have it .
is there enough of it ?
there' s not any more here none here either
hey , enode !
are you working hard ?
what do you know about hard work ?
all you do is play .
i do not play , enode , i explore .
you waste your time .
we must serve the gods , kaena .
so that they will protect us .
let' s not be late for the offering !
the protection of the gods is worthless .
here they are !
the monster .
it steals our sap and our souls .
it made our planet a desert
my queen , your attacks will end up killing us
our world is dying
you must save our people from extinction .
axis protect me !
well , well ...
ilpo .
don' t move .
don' t move , or the marauder will see you .
don' t move .
ilpo is in danger .
i told you ...
i warned you ...
ilpo is broken
very broken .
ilpo , it is me , kaena .
don' t be afraid
ilpo is still broken today
three times .
ilpo has been broken for a long time .
you are not broken , ilpo .
the insect can take many forms .
here .
they don' t grow any more like before .
it' s weird , i keep finding more and more dessicated branches .
what is that ?
oh , that ?
i came too close to a sharken .
kaena goes too far .
much too close to the great nothing .
ah , the great nothing !
the sharkens are not afraid of it .
you can see them playing in the clouds .
kaena will break .
never to return .
you returned , what did you see over there ?
that .
lots of those , everywhere .
you already saw this thing ?
behind the sea of clouds ?
an attacking marauder .
ilpo didn' t move .
never moved .
then ilpo fell , and was almost killed .
the worm caught up with ilpo .
the worm ?
did a worm catch up with you ?
and then , ilpo slept .
and then saw a man
not really a man ...
more like pure evil .
afterwards , there was too much light .
it was incredibly bright .
blue light .
what ?
in my dreams , there is a blue sun .
you saw a blue sun under the clouds ?
the bottom , all on top .
what ?
the bottom on the top .
the top on the bottom .
please explain !
the high priest !
kaena must leave quickly !
i know , i know .
it' s time for the offering .
let me go !
you were saying ?
i heard you .
speak !
fine , pretend you can' t talk
my brother will be able to make you speak .
kaena , where were you ?
did you make any new drawings ?
show them to us !
of course .
but don' t speak about this with anybody !
especially not with the high priest .
ok , i promise .
you saw a sharken near here ?
yes , very near .
did it fly very quickly ?
very quickly .
if i had wings ...
i could be free .
you don' t need wings to be free .
imagine another world , a beautiful world , overflowing with sap , where a blue sun is shining .
where is it ?
you saw it ?
no .
but i dreamed about it and ...
my children ... the sap is our vital force , but with the passing of time , it appears that we are exhausting our resources .
it' s true .
what do you make of this ?
i know your sufferings
they are also mine .
but we should not doubt the gods .
who gave us the gift of axis ?
who protects us from the great nothing ?
and its guards ?
the gods !
who , in the hour of our eternal rest ,
will open the doors of paradise to us ?
the gods !
who gave us life ?
the gods !
yes , our gods !
let us pray !
kaena , guess what i caught !
what is it , essy ?
a talking worm .
it' s in the cage .
i want to see it .
why are they holding us ?
they plan to eat us .
we have to escape from here .
follow me !
well , of all the nerve !
i' m going to go back and get my armor , my wings ... and get out of here !
i' il give the master a detailed report .
this worm doesn' t seem very smart .
he' s not any fun !
i bet he speaks better than you . well , he' s still not very smart .
hey , kaena ...
you like this , my sister ?
it' s ok .
a little boring though .
is our faith justified ?
yes !
haven' t we been very obedient to our benevolent gods ?
let us bring our offering to the well of the gods !
the gods are angry .
no !
not the great nothing !
no , my children !
it' s a sign , don' t you see ?
the gods are testing us .
they test our faith .
don' t be afraid to trust them with our lives !
don' t move !
if you flee , you defy the gods .
stay where you are !
bow down !
please , i ask of you !
obey the will of the gods !
kaena , wait !
kaena , what are you doing ?
zehos , the high priest moved .
the gods saved him .
they don' t favor him over us .
that' s true , but why did they destroy the temple ?
go back over there !
but she' s right ...
go back !
don' t be so foolish .
i saw you moving
like my parents , who you treated like sinners !
you dare to blaspheme in the temple ?
you' re crazy .
you wanted to save your life .
the gods directed me .
they decided to save me .
the gods did not save my parents .
your parents did not believe in the gods .
why would they have been saved ?
your parents made a choice .
i ask that you choose a different path .
you ask ?
how can you ask such a thing ?
your gods are deaf .
i don' t believe that they exist .
our lives are difficult .
when your parents died , i raised you .
i fostered your intelligence , your spirit .
today , you trample these gifts while ridiculing our gods instead of honoring them .
think of our lives beyond axis !
i do think about it !
all the time .
ah , of course ...
i am aware of the stream of lies you tell to the other children and of your drawings of imaginary worlds .
i saw another world ...
in your dreams .
it exists .
i saw a blue sun at the bottom of axis .
why do you keep deluding yourself ?
you' re crazy , like that poor ilpo
do you want to end up like him ?
to sit around killing insects all day ?
ilpo is not insane !
beyond the clouds , i saw ...
the great nothing , and that made you insane !
no !
look !
this is harder than our weak blades .
its creator does not fear your gods .
don' t provoke them !
give me that !
you wanted to kill me .
no , what i wanted ...
you are insane .
you are a danger to us all .
go after kaena , she is dangerous .
she provokes the anger of the gods and she puts our lives in danger .
she must not be allowed to leave the village .
i saw her !
over there .
even a tough girl like you can cry ?
i knew that you would be here .
i haven' t been here since childhood .
we' re not children anymore .
i' m sorry .
zehos , what will i do ?
this is the blade ?
the high priest wanted to tear it off me , i resisted and ...
i know that you' re innocent .
i will speak to him .
you' il return to the village .
i prefer to disappear into the great nothing .
let' s go , kaena !
listen !
the other world exists .
i will find it .
alas , high priest !
she has disappeared .
how can we appease our gods ?
glory to you , god of my people !
do you accept this offering ?
no !
this is unacceptable .
is this worthy of your gods ?
forgive me , almighty !
times are hard .
the sap is running out and ... a young heretic ridicules you .
what ?
she is fleeing to the east .
she wants to enter the great nothing ...
don' t you have any control over your people ?
almighty , she is only ...
she always was ...
a heretic ... strong enough to mislead all of the people .
the consequences would be severe .
the girl is already dead .
don' t think of her anymore !
devote yourself to the next harvest .
i warn you not to offend us any more !
i promise , almighty .
do you remember when we used to play outside of the village ?
i always loved it .
you were never afraid ?
yes , of course .
but i hid it from you .
and i knew that axis would guide me .
axis , protects me ! " you say .
as if it were alive .
it is alive .
it speaks to me .
you' re not a child anymore ...
you' re an " adult " now , is that it ?
how can you collect the sap , and eat the worms like everyone else ... without wondering what hides behind the clouds ?
i didn' t say that i' m not curious .
but it is necessary to have people to collect sap , and raise the worms ...
you were a comfort to me , at first .
but now , you' re becoming tedious .
you waste your time on the worms .
there is nothing else to eat .
also , i have my little brother to worry about .
i cannot ...
dream like me ?
damn your worms !
my children ... the gods appeared to me tonight .
they spoke to me .
they want to punish kaena .
her disobedience has provoked their anger .
the gods require a new harvest of sap .
before the end of the day .
this offering must be more generous than our previous one ... or we will all perish .
bring our offering to the well of the gods !
the sap .
i must have more .
soon , there will not be any more , my queen .
it is almost gone .
the villagers are all talking about it .
i don' t listen to the slaves !
death !
once the monster is dead , the sap will run .
majesty , for centuries , we' ve tried to kill it .
the slaves are starting to doubt us .
a revolt could start soon .
i beg you ,
let us work together now .
and our descendants ?
do you want them to be robbed of their sap by this monster ?
we must destroy it !
we must find a way to destroy it .
it will be done according to your wishes , my queen .
i understand , zehos .
you must go to essy .
forgive me .
find her !
a marauder !
oh no !
i hope that she' s ok .
no villager could have created the armor of this worm .
an invader must have survived .
gently .
master , if i may , this is a waste of time .
she is a primitive .
she' s a strange specimen .
is she the one you spoke to me about , assad ?
you are sure ?
yes , master .
this is definitely her .
she' s the opposite of the others , she is curious .
she has a kind of intuition .
she seems to know each branch .
during both of her escapes ,
she jumped with closed eyes , as if she was guided
not a very scientific approach .
agreed .
did she speak about a blue sun outside of axis ?
a common girl claims she' s seen a blue sun and you think she' s a prophet ?
excuse me , master !
this is complete foolishness .
it' s giving me a migraine !
ow !
a very bad migraine .
but what if vcano survived the crash landing ?
it is highly unlikely , master .
vcano was destroyed with the rest .
only metal scraps are left , scattered around axis , some of which were used to build this place .
then did she imagine seeing vcano ?
yes !
she probably saw a blue egg .
a beautiful , shining blue egg .
if vcano had actually survived ...
what' s this ?
she' s awake !
stay back , creatures of the great nothing !
back yourself !
you don' t have anything to fear from us .
why have you brought her back here , gommi ?
ask the little genius assad instead !
why ?
our master wanted to help her .
and what do they do with the worms ?
they devour them .
that' s disgusting !
and they enjoy it .
barbarians !
the master wishes to speak with you .
what' s going on here ?
final preparations before takeoff .
takeoff ?
this base is an intergalactic vessel .
come again ?
typical humanoid reaction !
you' re incapable of understanding .
assad , the master requests our presence .
take it !
it belongs to you .
are you gods ?
no .
my name is opaz .
i am mortal , like you .
we do not wish you any harm .
you were wounded .
we looked after you .
and my blade ?
later .
my followers will mend your clothing .
are they worms ?
worms " ?
worms ?
of the super advanced family of the oligocantes , we exceed any artificial intelligence .
as for myself , i speak 1200 languages ,
i know 10, 000 galaxies , and can repair any form of technology based on silicone .
worms " ?
i think not !
you' re really only a worm .
we' re not only worms !
you' re of the worm family !
stop speaking to me about worms !
i hear you speaking that gibberish " worm " language with everyone else .
they are ashamed !
they' re reluctant to associate with you !
but it is our language .
i do not speak in " worm " .
i prefer our worms , they are less talkative .
your worms are underdeveloped .
and i , i am superior to you .
but i can still eat you .
i hope not .
i would be lost without gommi and the others .
i could not have survived without them . nor built this vessel to return to my home .
where is your home ?
very far from here .
my queen , this thing resists your attacks .
what if it outlasts us ?
if we disappear ... our race will die out .
a queen must protect her people .
i know what you want , voxem .
you are the last male .
you burn to mate with me .
but what about our future ?
there is no future for us as long as the monster is alive .
we can overcome this obstacle , my queen .
i think that an invader survived .
it lives on top of axis .
let us find it , it will carry the item we need .
i make the decisions !
your world is not as you imagine it to be .
its name is astria , and here is its twin , tals .
you discovered it yesterday evening .
centuries ago , a vcarien vessel transporting my people exploded in space , close to your planet .
i was the sole survivor .
axis !
it is your world , kaena .
my escape pod landed in its branches .
axis saved me .
your people live in the center of axis .
here .
where the gravitational forces of two planets cancel themselves out .
we are thus here .
i believed i was descending towards the roots of axis .
in reality , i went up .
the bottom is on top , the top , below !
ilpo said that .
you saved him .
i bandaged his wounds .
as i did for the other creatures of axis .
thus , the blue sun is there .
the blue sun ?
i often dream of it .
it is at the base of axis .
look !
it is vcano vcano ?
its brain contains all our knowledge transmitted to vcariens since childhood .
it is our memory .
so , it exists .
master !
nothing good can come out of the brain of a primitive creature !
do not underestimate her .
the vessel will soon be ready .
we will finally leave this pitiful , small ... world .
as you always wished , master .
speak for yourself !
we can recover vcano and the knowledge that it has yet to transmit to me .
instead of letting her be eaten , you had to go and save her !
how about we go to the foot of axis and see what' s really there ?
perhaps , assad .
and you , do you miss her ?
she will return , won' t she ?
soon , i hope .
is she on another world ?
i don' t know .
it' s possible .
you should' ve gone with her !
you are undoubtedly right .
help !
ilpo ?
the ground trembles !
now !
have you seen my brother ?
the gods are testing us .
we must pray .
i had a nightmare .
please ...
here is the proof of their mental confusion .
the blue sun , vcano , is attacked by a maleficent force .
the gods are angered .
do not ridicule the gods !
on your knees !
no !
stand upright !
please !
the place will break down .
we must obey the will of the gods !
was that your nightmare ?
vcano was destroyed ?
no , but it suffered .
and if it suffers , axis suffers .
they are linked , aren' t they ?
i don' t know .
axis is in danger .
the village ...
zehos , essy , the children ...
i must go there .
wait !
let' s go to the village together ... and then find vcano !
go , my friend !
i know that you must .
will this last much longer ?
calm yourself !
gods of my people , my gods ... we need you .
our village is destroyed .
we do not have anywhere else to go .
answer us , please .
answer me !
is everything okay ?
come , enode .
i have good news .
the gods spoke to me .
will they help us ?
better than that .
they will deliver us .
our sufferings will be rewarded .
they destroyed our village
for what purpose ?
so that we can join them .
the gods have called us , and offered us a refuge .
we have succeeded the ultimate test !
let the people know .
we leave tomorrow .
i am ready .
perfect !
hold on ...
that' s not quite right !
complete the preparations !
on my return , we will be able to take off .
this expedition is risky .
please reconsider !
vcano exists , gommi .
kaena and i must attempt to recover it .
i don' t approve of this armor .
it will protect you .
not as much as my blade .
let' s go !
a girl with a worm ?
avoiding the take off ?
the take off ?
faster , assad !
faster !
this idiot has the brains of a slug .
is everything okay , zumo ?
look out !
poor zumo !
i am sorry .
you' d better be !
this mission is useless .
to risk our lives over dreams ?
the success of this mission is more important than our lives .
we must face our destiny .
time is running out .
i still say this is a bad idea !
a very bad idea .
let' s go back before we' re killed .
the faster we turn around , the sooner we can be home .
the harvest is finished !
we are free !
let us join the gods !
they open their doors to us .
they have all gone insane .
but the gods said ...
there are no gods .
we must leave .
let' s find kaena !
that is not the way to paradise .
the gods call us .
i saw you at the temple beseeching the gods in vain .
capture this heretic !
save yourself , essy !
you have just sent your brother to his death .
but which branch !
it' s very quiet .
too quiet .
it' s close .
what' s close ?
what' s she saying ?
quiet !
my bionic ear doesn' t hear anything .
how could she ...
don' t move !
otherwise the marauder will see .
don' t move !
master , let' s go !
gommi , stay here !
let' s leave now !
so , the invader is finally here !
it is time to use you to destroy what you left behind .
do not kill him !
kill her !
my brothers and sisters , we fly to meet our gods .
i must reveal my intentions to her .
there' s no hurry , master !
if vcano and axis are bound , what will happen if i take vcano ?
won' t axis be destroyed ?
master , this world is dying .
but it is her world , gommi .
she has a right to know .
you' re right .
nobody asked you .
i must convince her to come with us .
if you were given the opportunity ... to leave axis , would you leave ?
it is my world .
you could create another one .
a less hostile world , a world of abundance , of knowledge , where you could dream peacefully .
you could build a civilization .
got you !
essy , what are you doing here ?
ilpo took care of me .
kaena is not broken .
don' t be afraid .
they are friends .
they saved my life , and protected me .
what other pitfalls await me today ?
essy , where is zehos ?
everyone left for the well of the gods .
everyone flew away inside .
they left the village .
a horrible thing awaits them .
i dreamed it .
i must find them .
there is no time for that .
and vcano ?
you speak !
i knew it !
i was right .
stay here with ilpo until i return !
i' m coming with you .
i want to see zehos .
it is too dangerous .
i will bring zehos back to you .
i promise .
assad , you stay here to protect ilpo and the child .
it would be my honor .
but master ...
you are going alone with kaena ?
that is utter foolishness .
it is useless to resist , master , i' m coming with you .
i expected as much .
wait , i will explain this to you .
there is " floating " and then there is " flying " .
floating " , you' re powerless to steer .
flying " , you choose your destiny .
you need to slow down .
careful , kaena !
hold tight , gommi !
i' m not designed for stunt flying .
thank you , gommi .
don' t mention it .
our queen is obsessed with the destruction of the monster .
with each of her attacks , one of us dies in order to regenerate the queen' s power .
who will be the next one ?
the queen fears the " ultimate fusion " because she knows that she will have to sacrifice her own life to generate new lives .
a new generation of slnites .
join me so that we can live .
i have something important to tell you .
what is it ?
you , your people , axis ... you are in danger because of me .
you asked if vcano and axis were dependent .
it is more than that .
they are one .
the loss of my vessel , the birth of axis took place at the same time .
vcano created axis .
and if i recover vcano ...
what do you mean , " recover " ?
i must bring it back to my world .
what will happen to my people ?
axis will die .
and us with it .
you foresaw so many deaths ?
i thought your people were too primitive to comprehend the future .
but then i met you .
come with us .
a place awaits you in my vessel .
and my people ?
you are unaware of the quantity of energy ...
you knew that from the start ?
kaena , your world is dying .
you must understand the importance of vcano !
i rue the day we met !
here !
it could be useful to you .
my people need me .
axis , protect me !
take pity on me !
the gods will help us , they promised aid .
your gods are only sap eating creatures !
their anger is momentary .
we just need to pray .
we had faith in you .
let' s not waste our time !
let' s find an exit !
so , puny thing !
you are the one who killed my little pet .
you' re so fortunate to finally see your gods !
you are not gods .
what did you do with my people ?
they are only slaves .
before the arrival of the blue monster , they did not exist .
your species is a cheap aberration .
it' s a pity that we are not compatible .
to meld with this small body would be more pleasant than what awaits me with my queen .
where is the old man ?
where is the invader ?
i don' t know .
you lie , slave .
why would a powerful god be concerned with a sick old man ?
it' s no concern of yours !
we know where to wait for him .
he will come to us .
put her with the others !
it' s kaena .
she' s alive !
zehos , you survived .
but essy ...
i don' t know what happened to him .
he' s safe , he is at the village with ilpo
i knew that you would save us .
follow the worm !
a worm that speaks !
where is opaz ?
in the search party for the vcano
the monsters are waiting for him .
they want to destroy vcano i don' t care about vcano !
only the master matters to me .
i should have stayed with him .
bring them all back to the well of the gods .
you' re not coming ?
i must find
vcano and opaz .
but what about us ?
i must go to protect our future .
i must leave .
and me ?
i refuse to leave you .
you will never lose me .
i' m coming with you .
to find the master .
no .
show them the way !
i will find him .
i promise you .
i need you to help them .
the primitive worms need you .
very well .
but after they are safe ...
i will return for the master .
here !
good luck , kaena !
thank you , my friend .
that goes straight to the village .
keep going !
it' s the only way .
good , they' re safe ,
i' m leaving .
wait , i' m coming with you .
i won' t leave without kaena .
vcano !
i came to recover you .
vcano , speak to me !
open for me !
your monster ...
your monster destroyed my planet .
our vessel was crushed ...
it stole our precious sap !
we didn' t mean you any harm .
it starved my people .
you created it , you will destroy it .
that' s not possible .
it doesn' t listen to me .
it does not open .
it has forgotten me .
then ... you will die !
let us meld , my queen !
it exists !
i' il get you out of here , opaz .
hold on !
you have ... succeeded , kaena .
it' s all thanks to you .
i didn' t do anything .
opaz , tell me what to do !
you must tell me what to do !
monster !
i finally see you .
now , you will die .
slave !
my children ... not yet .
i must destroy it first .
kaena , wake up !
please , kaena !
opaz , where are you ?
kaena , listen to me !
my people are no more .
i was the last .
the others died here in the vessel centuries ago .
only vcano survived .
it created an immense reservoir of life ,
axis , so that you could exist , you , and the humans .
vcano created you .
i do not understand .
it chose you to carry on the memory of the vcariens .
it chose you , kaena .
the future depends on you .
you must guide your people .
but how ?
how will i know what to do ?
please wake up , kaena !
stay with me !
the master ?
wake up !
she is dead .
kaena is dead .
who will lead us ?
she' s alive !
there' s no more sap , no more water .
how will we survive ?
it chose you .
to guide your people .
stand up !
that is nothing .
there is much to learn .
beyond the clouds a vast universe awaits us where a million suns illuminate unknown and inhabited worlds .
i am not your master .
my knowledge is yours .
no one thinks for you !
from now on , we are all free .
come , friends !
we are safe !
look !
will it be beautiful there , in our new world ?
