what the fuck is that ?
jimmy ?
what' s up ?
did i hit something ?
what the fuck is that ?
maybe you got a flat ?
no .
what the fuck ?
you better pull over and see .
he' s still alive .
you piece of shit !
die , you motherfucker !
look at me !
as far back as i can remember , i always wanted to be a gangster .
to me ... ... being a gangster was better than being president of the united states .
even before i went to the cabstand for an after school job ... ... i knew i wanted to be part of them .
it was there that i knew i belonged .
to me , it meant being somebody ... ... in a neighborhood full of nobodies .
they weren' t like anybody else .
they did whatever they wanted .
they parked in front of hydrants and never got a ticket .
when they played cards all night ... ... nobody ever called the cops .
tony stacks .
how are you ?
tuddy cicero .
could this be the canarsie kid ?
tuddy .
tuddy ran the cabstand and the bella vista pizzeria ... ... and other places for his brother , paul , who was the boss of the neighborhood .
paulie might have moved slow ... ... but it was only because paulie didn' t have to move for anybody .
it' s your fault .
you started it !
i started it ?
it' s your fault .
at first my parents loved that i found a job across the street from the house .
my father , who was irish , was sent to work at the age of 1 1 .
he liked that i got myself a job .
he always used to say that american kids were spoiled lazy .
henry !
watch how you cross !
bring back milk !
my mother was happy after she found out the ciceros ... ... came from the same part of sicily as she did .
to my mother ... ... that was the answer to all her prayers .
i was the luckiest kid in the world .
i could go anywhere , do anything .
i knew everybody , and everybody knew me .
wiseguys would pull up and tuddy would let me park their cadillacs .
here i am , this little kid , i can' t even see over the steering wheel ... ... and i' m parking cadillacs .
but , it wasn' t too long ... ... before my parents changed their minds about my job at the cabstand .
for them , it was supposed to be a part time job .
but for me ... ... it was definitely full time .
that' s all i wanted to do .
people like my father could never understand , but i was part of something .
i belonged .
i was treated like a grown up .
tell him 519 .
every day i was learning to score .
a dollar here , a dollar there .
i was living in a fantasy .
did you have a good day at school ?
my father was always pissed off .
pissed that he made such lousy money , that my brother michael ... ... was in a wheelchair .
he was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house .
tell me about this .
it' s a letter from school .
it says you haven' t been there in months .
in months !
you' re a bum !
want to grow up to be a bum ?
after a while , he was mostly pissed because i hung around the cabstand .
he knew what went on there .
every once in a while i' d have to take a beating .
but by then , i didn' t care .
the way i saw it ... ... everybody takes a beating sometime .
i can' t make any more deliveries .
what ?
you' il fuck everything up .
my dad says he' il kill me .
look .
come with me .
is that him there ?
no .
how about him ?
no .
that' s the guy ...
get him .
excuse me .
scumbag .
come here , you piece of shit .
know this kid ?
yeah .
know where he lives ?
yeah .
you deliver mail to his house ?
yeah .
from now on , any letter from school to his house comes directly here .
understand ?
another letter from school goes to that kid' s house ... ... in the oven you' il go , head first .
that was it .
no more letters from truant officers .
no letters from school .
in fact , no more letters from anybody .
after a few weeks , my mother went to the post office to complain .
how could i go to school after that ... ... and pledge allegiance and sit through good government bullshit ?
paulie hated phones .
he wouldn' t have one in his house .
mickey called .
want me to call him back ?
all right , make the call .
he got all his calls second hand .
then you' d have to call the people back .
got a nickel ?
get him on the phone .
there were guys , that' s all they did all day , was take care of paulie' s calls .
for a guy who moved all day long ... ... paulie didn' t talk to six people .
with union problems ... ... or a beef in the numbers ... ... only the top guys spoke with paulie about the problem .
everything was one on one .
paulie hated conferences .
he didn' t want anybody hearing what he said ... ... or anyone listening to what he was being told .
hundreds of guys depended on him , and he got a piece of everything they made .
it was a tribute , like in the old country , except they were doing it in america .
all they got from paulie was protection from the guys trying to rip them off .
that' s what it' s all about .
that' s what the fbi could never understand .
what paulie and the organization does ... ... is protect people who can' t go to the cops .
that' s it .
they' re like the police department for wiseguys .
people looked at me differently , and they knew i was with somebody .
i didn' t have to wait in line at the bakery on sunday morning for fresh bread .
the owner knew who i was with , and no matter how many people were waiting ... ... i was taken care of first .
our neighbors stopped parking in our driveway , even though we had no car .
at 13 ... ... i was making more money than most of the grown ups in the neighborhood .
i had it all .
one day ...
one day , some neighborhood kids carried my mother' s groceries all the way home .
you know why ?
it was out of respect .
what do you think ?
aren' t my shoes great ?
you look like a gangster .
they shot me .
help !
henry , shut the door .
that was the first time i had ever seen anyone shot .
can' t have that in here .
jesus christ !
i can' t have that in this joint .
i remember feeling bad about the guy , but also ... ... feeling maybe tuddy was right .
i knew paulie didn' t want anyone dying in the building .
you' re a real jerk .
you wasted eight fucking aprons on this guy .
what' s wrong with you ?
i got to toughen this kid up .
it was a glorious time .
and wiseguys were all over the place .
it was before apalachin and before crazy joe ... ... decided to take on a boss and start a war .
it was when i met the world .
and it was when i first met jimmy conway .
he couldn' t have been more than 28 or 29 at the time , but he was already a legend .
he' d walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild .
he' d give a doorman $100 just for opening the door .
he' d give hundreds to the dealers and the guys who ran the games .
the bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold .
the irishman is here to take you guineas ' money .
want a drink ?
give me a seven and seven .
i' d like you to meet the kid henry .
how you doin ' ?
thank you .
keep them coming .
jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city .
he was first locked up at 11 , and doing hits for mob bosses at 16 .
hits never bothered jimmy .
it was business .
but what jimmy really loved to do ... what he really loved to do was steal .
he actually enjoyed it .
jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in movies .
give me your wallet .
you might know who we are , but we know who you are .
he was one of the city' s biggest hijackers ... ... of booze , cigarettes , razor blades , shrimp and lobsters .
shrimp and lobsters were best .
they went fast .
almost all of them were gimmies .
they just gave it up , no problem .
they called him jimmy the gent .
help the lady .
drivers loved him .
they used to tip him off ... ... about the really good loads .
of course , everybody got a piece .
thanks , i' il be back for the rest later .
henry , come here .
say hello to tommy .
you' re gonna be working together , okay ?
help him .
go ahead .
jimmy , you got anything good ?
and when the cops assigned a whole army to stop jimmy , what did he do ?
he made them partners .
i' d complain , but who' d listen ?
what do you need ?
two luckys .
here you go , henry .
thanks a lot .
what do you need ?
one pall mall .
what are you doing ?
it' s all right .
says who ?
your mother ?
how many pall malls you need ?
where' d you get the cigarettes ?
get him out of here .
it' s okay .
it' s not okay !
you don' t understand .
you don' t understand .
store' s closed .
henry got pinched .
where ?
by the factory .
henry hill .
the people of the state of new york vs. henry hill .
docket # 704162 .
yes , sir .
that' s me .
just stand there .
now stay there .
counselor , proceed .
congratulations .
here' s your graduation present .
why ?
i got pinched .
everyone does , but you did it right .
you told them nothing .
i thought you' d be mad .
i' m not mad , i' m proud of you .
you took your first pinch like a man ... ... and learned the two greatest things in life .
look at me .
never rat on your friends ... ... and always keep your mouth shut .
here he is !
you broke your cherry !
congratulations !
by the time i grew up , there was 30 billion a year in cargo ... ... moving through idlewild airport , and we tried to steal every bit of it .
see , we grew up near the airport .
it belonged to paulie .
we had friends and relatives who worked all over it .
they would tip us off about what was coming in and moving out .
if any truckers or airlines gave us trouble ... ... paulie' s union people scared them with a strike .
it was beautiful .
it was a bigger moneymaker than numbers and jimmy was in charge .
whenever we needed money , we' d rob the airport .
to us , it was better than citibank .
you got a phone ?
come on !
two niggers just stole my truck .
can you fucking believe that shit ?
there was jimmy and tommy ... ... and me .
and there was anthony stabile .
frankie carbone .
and then there was mo black' s brother , fat andy .
and his guys , frankie the wop ... ... and freddy no nose .
and then there was pete the killer , who was sally balls ' brother .
then you had nickey eyes ... ... and mikey franzese .
jimmy two times , nicknamed because he said everything twice .
i' il get the papers , get the papers .
what is this ?
coats ?
i need suits , henry , not coats .
suits are up on thursday .
but it' s the middle of summer .
what' il i do with fur coats ?
you don' t want furs ?
i' il take them away .
no , i want them .
we' il hang them in the freezer with the meat .
for us , to live any other way was nuts .
to us , those goody good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks ... ... and took the subway to work and worried about bills , were dead .
they were suckers .
they had no balls .
if we wanted something , we just took it .
if anyone complained twice , they got hit so bad they never complained again .
it was all just routine .
you didn' t even think about it .
frankie , what the fuck does 520 ... ... have to do with 469 ?
520 ain' t even close to 469 .
what' s that got to do with anything ?
piece of cake .
don' t worry about the alarms .
i just got to get a key .
no problems ?
i' il take care of it .
tell him what you were telling me .
too good to be true .
big score coming from air france .
bags of money coming in .
americans change their money over into french money and send it back here .
calm down .
it' s beautiful .
it' s totally , totally untraceable .
our only problem is getting a key , but i got a plan .
me and frenchy and this citizen .
yeah , he' s a piece of work .
if i' m right , there could be half a mil coming in , all cash .
the best time is probably over a weekend .
so maybe saturday night .
there' s a jewish holiday monday .
they won' t find out until tuesday .
beautiful .
what about the security ?
security ?
you' re looking at it .
it' s a joke .
i' m the midnight to eight man .
he just comes in like he' s picking up lost baggage .
it' s beautiful .
it won' t be a problem at all .
good .
we' re on .
what' s really funny is that fucking bank job in secaucus .
i' m in the weeds lying down .
he said , " what are you doing ?
i said , " resting .

he pulls me in , starts asking questions .

that' s what i want to talk to you about .

it' s seven big ones you owe me . $7, 000 , that ain' t peanuts .

this prick asked me to christen his kid .
i charged him $7, 000 .
you really are a funny guy .
i' m worried .
i' m hearing bad things .
he treats me like i' m a fucking fag .
i got to go on the lam to get away from this guy .
this ain' t right .
i can' t go here or there .
i talk to them a million times .
they don' t listen .
if you tell him , he' il stop .
i' il wind up being declared m. i. a.
they' il find me in a car in the weeds .
you' ve known this tommy all your life .
this cocksucker' s an arch criminal .
when i leave my house in the morning i look over both shoulders .
this is no way to live .
i' m no fence jumper .
tell me what to do , i' il do it .
what could i do ?
if there was something i could do , i would .
i' d like to help you out .
tell him what we talked about .
maybe you could come in with me , take a piece of this joint .
it' d be good .
what are you talking about ?
you mean the restaurant ?
it' s a classy place .
you' ve been in here a million times .
tommy taking over this joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig .
i don' t mean any disrespect , but that' s the way it is .
i' m begging you .
what can i say ?
what am i going to do ?
what does he want from me ?
i don' t know anything about the restaurant business .
all i know is how to sit down and order a meal .
not for you .
just a place to hang .
the chef is great .
the shows are good .
there' s a lot of whores coming in .
what do you want from me ?
tommy' s a bad seed .
what am i supposed to do ?
shoot him ?
that wouldn' t be a bad idea .
i' m sorry i said that .
i didn' t mean it .
it' s just that he' s scaring me .
i just need help .
help me , please .
know anything about the restaurant business ?
he knows everything .
he' s there day and night .
another fucking few minutes , he could be a stool .
you want me to be your partner ?
is that what you' re telling me ?
what do you think i' m talking about ?
paulie , please .
it' s not even fair .
you don' t understand .
you run the joint .
maybe i' il try to help you .
god bless you , paulie .
you' ve always been fair with me .
now he' s got paulie as a partner .
any problems , he goes to paulie .
trouble with a bill , he goes to paulie .
trouble with the cops , deliveries , tommy ... ... he calls paulie .
but now he has to pay paulie ... ... every week no matter what .
business is bad ?
fuck you , pay me .
had a fire ?
fuck you , pay me .
the place got hit by lightning ?
fuck you , pay me .
also , paulie could do anything .
like run up bills on the joint' s credit .
and why not ?
nobody will pay for it anyway .
take deliveries at the front door and sell it out the back at a discount .
take a $200 case of booze and sell it for $100 .
it doesn' t matter .
it' s all profit .
then finally , when there' s nothing left ... ... when you can' t borrow another buck from the bank ... ... you bust the joint out .
you light a match .
do you need help reaching anything ?
you look like you' re decorating a christmas tree .
she' s from the five towns .
who ?
the jew broad .
diane .
i been trying to bang her for a month .
she won' t go out with me alone .
no .
no , what ?
no , what ?
who asked you anything ?
wait to hear what i' m going to say .
all right , what ?
she won' t go out with italians alone .
she' s prejudiced against italians .
you fucking believe that ?
in this day and age ?
what is this world coming to ?
i can' t believe this .
a jew broad , prejudiced against italians .
she won' t go out without her girlfriend .
so you come along for her friend .
see ?
i knew it .
i knew it .
what the fuck is wrong with that ?
when is it ?
tomorrow night .
i' m meeting tuddy .
you could meet tuddy .
come early and then go .
why do you always do this ?
don' t give me that shit .
what did i ask you for ?
a favor .
i do a lot of fucking favors for you .
i' m trying to bang this broad .
help me out .
i don' t understand you .
she' s beautiful !
her family lives in the five towns .
these jews got money .
maybe the family owns the whole block .
you may wind up with a big score .
you with your fucking mouth !
i had a meeting with tuddy at 1 1 : 00 and here i am a backup guy for tommy .
did you have enough to eat ?
it was delicious .
i' m just watching my diet .
let me watch your figure .
i couldn' t wait to go .
i was ordering dessert when they were eating dinner .
when they were having coffee , i was asking for the check .
have some coffee .
it' il wake you up .
joe , can we have the check ?
what are you doing ?
i got to go .
we just got here .
i got that thing .
we' il leave together .
this way we don' t go out like a bunch of hobos , one at a time .
i couldn' t stand him .
i thought he was really obnoxious .
he kept fidgeting around .
you don' t mind , do you ?
that' s very annoying .
good ?
you might prefer manischewitz , but it' d look funny on my table .
ready ?
lighten up .
we just got here .
what are you doing ?
before it was time to go , he was pushing me into the car ... ... then pulling me out .
it was ridiculous .
diane and tommy made us promise to meet them again on friday .
we agreed .
but when friday came around , henry stood me up .
i feel terrible .
i don' t know where he is .
he really liked you .
all he did was talk about her .
we were a trio instead of a double date .
he should have called .
i hope it' s nothing serious .
but i made tommy take me looking for him .
tommy , what the fuck ?
you got some nerve standing me up .
nobody does that to me .
who do you think you are , frankie valli or some big shot ?
i forgot .
i thought it was next week .
it was this friday and you agreed , so you' re a liar !
we can talk about this .
talk to you after what you just did to me ?
forget it .
i thought you would stand me up .
you looked bored .
you didn' t say anything .
let me make it up to you .
i' il think about it .
i remember , she was screaming on the street and i mean loud .
but she looked good .
i' il think about it .
but it' il cost you , hill .
a lot .
she had these great eyes just like liz taylor' s .
hello , henry .
ready ?
yeah .
come on .
wait a minute .
what ?
you have to cover that cross .
my mother sees that ...
mom .
meet my friend , henry hill .
my daughter says you' re half jewish .
it' s just the good half .
see you later .
you' re leaving your car ?
he watches the car for me .
it' s easier than leaving it at a garage .
it' s a lot quicker that way .
i like going in this way .
it' s better than waiting in line .
how are you doin ' ?
what' s up ?
here you go .
how are you doin ' , gino ?
good .
how are you ?
every time i come here , i see you two .
don' t you work ?

over there .
thanks a lot , tony .
what do you do ?

what do you do ?
i' m in construction .
they don' t feel like you' re in construction .
i' m a union delegate .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... the copacabana is proud to present the king of one liners ... ... henry youngman .
how are you all ?
i' m glad to be here .
take my wife , please .
i take my wife everywhere but she finds her way home .
i said , " where do you wanna go for our anniversary ?
she said , " somewhere i' ve never been before .
i said , " try the kitchen .
dr. wellsler is here .
gave a guy six months to live .
couldn' t pay his bill .
gave him another six months .
i love this crowd .
air france made me .
we walked out with $420, 000 without using a gun .
and we did the right thing .
we gave paulie his tribute .
sixty thousand .
it' s going to be a good summer .
i' m proud of you .
that is a lot of money for a kid like you .
anybody asks you where you got it , you got it in vegas playing craps .

roses are red , my love
violets are blue
sugar is sweet , my love
but not as sweet as you
one night , bobby vinton sent us champagne .
there was nothing like it .
i didn' t think there was anything strange in any of this .
a 21 year old kid with such connections .
he was an exciting guy .
he was really nice .
he introduced me to everybody .
everybody wanted to be nice to him .
he knew how to handle it .
don' t buy wigs that come off at the wrong time .
morrie' s wigs don' t come off !
even underwater .
and remember , morrie' s wigs are tested against hurricane winds .
forget about money .
you can afford a morrie wig .
call me now !
come in for a personalized fitting .
morrie , jimmy' s waiting .
you' re past due .
i' ve been good to you .
but there' s something unreasonable going on here .
jimmy' s being a ball breaker .
give him 8 to 5 on cleveland .
i never had to pay the vigorish he demands .
what am i , a schmuck ?
you borrowed his money .
pay him .
i didn' t agree to three points above the vig .
what are you going to do ?
going to fight with jimmy conway ?
he wants his money .
give him his money and we' il go !
fuck him !
fuck him in the ear !
fuck him in the other ear !
did i ever bust his balls ?
i could' ve dropped a dime a million times .
don' t call the cops .

what happened ?
what happened ?
are you all right ?
who did it ?
this guy who lives across the street from me that i' ve known all my life .
he started to touch me .
he grabbed me .
i told him to stop .
he didn' t stop .
i hit him back .
and then he got really angry .
he pushed me out of the car .
you sure you' re all right ?
why don' t you go inside and get yourself together .
clean up .
what do you want , fucko ?
i swear on my mother , if you touch her again , you' re dead .
don' t shoot .
hide this .
are you all right ?
are you all right ?
i know there are women ... ... who would have gotten out the minute their boyfriend ... ... gave them a gun to hide .
but i didn' t .
it turned me on .
mazel tov !
why don' t you be like henry ?
he' s got a nice girl .
he' s settling down now .
he' s married .
pretty soon he' il have a nice family .
and you' re still bouncing around from girl to girl .
it was like he had two families .
the first time i was introduced to all of them at once , it was crazy .
paulie and his brothers had lots of sons and nephews .
almost all of them were named peter or paul .
it was unbelievable .
meet paulie jr . , my nephew .
and this is petey .
there must have been two dozen peters and pauls there ...
this is marie . ... all married to girls named marie .
she looks italian .
and they named all their daughters marie .
and this is pete .
no , i mean paulie .
i get confused myself .
by the time i had met everybody , i thought i was drunk .
paulie , you shouldn' t have .
welcome to the family .
sunday dinner ?
so beautiful .
i want to cry .
here' s something to help you get started .
the bag .
the bag .
what bag ?
the bag with the envelopes in it , all the money .
don' t worry .
nobody' s going to steal that here .
he didn' t call ?
he' s with his friends .
what kind of person doesn' t call ?
he' s a grown up .
he doesn' t have to call every five minutes .
a grown up would get you an apartment .
don' t start .
mom , you' re the one who wanted us here .
you' re here a month and sometimes i know he doesn' t come home at all .
what kind of people are these ?
what do you want me to do ?
what can you do ?
he' s not jewish .
did you know what these people were like ?
your father never stayed out all night without calling .
daddy never went out at all , ma !
keep out of it !
you don' t know how i feel !
how do you feel now ?
you don' t know where he is or who he' s with !
he' s with his friends !
dad !
leave him alone .
he' s suffered enough .
he hasn' t digested a decent meal in six weeks .
where were you ?
why didn' t you call ?
we were worried !
a married man does not stay out like this !
normal people don' t act like this !
what' s wrong with you ?
you' re not normal .
she' s right !
what' s wrong with you ?
what kind of person are you ?
what is the matter with you ?
what kind of people are they ?
we weren' t married to nine to five guys .
but the first time i realized how different ... ... was when mickey had a hostess party .
karen , where you from ?
lawrence .
on the island .
nice .
i' m from miami .
ever been there ?
it' s okay , but it' s like you died and woke up in jew heaven .
stop picking at that .
i' d like to smack his face .
the red haired guy ?
the guy' s hands are all over me .
so i told him , " keep your fucking hands off me , or i' il cut them off .
she means it .
he' s lucky .
i just mention this to vinnie ...
how can you mention it ?
vinnie' d kill him .
vinnie' il kill the miserable bastard , then he' il be there for life .
talk about problems .
what about jeannie' s kid ?
he was in an argument .
a $10 card game .
he pulls out a gun .
the gun goes off .
some kid gets killed .
when the grandmother hears ... ... she has a heart attack and drops dead .
now jeannie has a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor .
jeannie drinks .
maybe she' s depressed .
give me a break .
she' s drunk .
as soon as something happens , you make them out to be saints .
they had bad skin and wore too much makeup .
they didn' t look very good .
they looked beat up .
and the stuff they wore ... ... was thrown together and cheap .
a lot of pantsuits and double knits .
she spends her life in a nightgown .
the woman is no angel , believe me .
they talked about their rotten kids ... ... and about beating them with broom handles and belts .
and the kids still didn' t listen .
when henry picked me up , i was dizzy .
i don' t know if i could live like that !
god forbid , what would happen if you had to go to prison ?
mickey said that jeannie' s husband ...
do you know why jeannie' s husband went to the can ?
because he wanted to get away from her .
let me tell you something .
nobody goes to jail unless they want to .
unless they make themselves get caught .
they don' t have things organized .
i know what i' m doing .
you know who goes to jail ?
nigger stickup men .
know why they get caught ?
because they fall asleep in the getaway car .
come on , don' t worry so much , sweetie .
come here .
after a while , it got to be all normal .
none of it seemed like crimes .
henry was just enterprising .
he and the guys made bucks hustling while other guys ... ... sat on their asses waiting for handouts .
our husbands weren' t brain surgeons , just blue collar guys ...
the only way they could make real extra money was to go out and cut corners .
where' s the strong box , you varmint ?
don' t fucking move !
don' t move !
see you at the diner .
i' m riding shotgun .
did you see him give it right over ?
back to the hideout to split up the loot .
we were all very close .
there were never any outsiders around .
absolutely never .
being together all the time made everything seem all the more normal .
police .
i' m detective deacy .
this is detective silvestri .
we have a search warrant .
would you read and sign it ?
anywhere ?
we have to go through everything .
you want some coffee ?
no coffee now , thanks .
be careful .
we' il just go about our business .
there was always a little harassment .
they wanted to talk to henry about this or that .
they' d make me sign their subpoenas or warrants .
but mostly they just wanted a handout .
a few bucks to keep things quiet no matter what they found .
i always asked if they wanted coffee .
some wives , like mickey conway ... ... used to curse at them and spit on the floor .
on her own floor !
that never made any sense to me .
it was better to be polite and call the lawyer .
happy birthday to you
we always did everything together and were always in the same crowd .
anniversaries , christenings .
we only went to each other' s houses .
the women played cards .
when kids were born , mickey and jimmy were the first at the hospital .
when we went to the islands or vegas for vacation ... ... we went together .
no outsiders ever .
it got to be normal .
i began to be proud that my husband was willing to risk his neck ... ... to get us the little extras .
but i got mom to watch the babies tomorrow night .
can' t do it .
why not ?
i just can' t .
i got something lined up .
but tomorrow' s the only night she can do it .
pretty please ?
i can' t .
what do you want me to do ?
i got to go .
wait a minute .
i need money to go shopping .
how much ?
that much .
this much .
give me a kiss .
see you later .
all right .
i always dreamed the boy i love would come along
and he' d be tall and handsome , rich and strong
welcome home , batts .

we can' t just dump him on the street .
i know a place upstate .
they' il never find him .
more tablecloths .
i didn' t want to get blood on your floor .
go open your trunk .
we' il get a shovel at my mother' s house .
she has a shovel here somewhere .
quiet , i don' t want to wake her .
look who' s here .
what happened ?
i hit something on the road .
jimmy' il tell you .
what happened to him ?
i haven' t seen you in so long .
what happened to him ?
you , too .
how are you ?
why are you up so late ?
he came in .
you came in .
i' m so happy to see him .
go inside .
make yourselves comfortable .
i' il make you something to eat .
go to sleep .
we' re leaving .
i can' t .
not while he' s home .
i haven' t seen him in so long .
i want to see him .
you go inside .
this stuff is like lead .
tell me , where you been ?
i haven' t seen you .
you haven' t called .
where have you been ?
i been working nights .
and tonight we were out late .
we took a ride out to the country and hit a deer .
that' s where all the blood is from .
jimmy told you .
it reminds me , i need this knife .
i' m taking this , okay ?
just for a while .
the poor thing .
we hit the deer and his paw .
what do you call it ?
the paw .
the hoof .
got caught in the grill .
i got to hack it off .
ma , it' s a sin to leave it there .
i' il bring the knife back .
delicious .
why don' t you get yourself a nice girl ?
i do , almost every night .
but get yourself a girl so you could settle down .
i do , every night .
then i' m free .
i love you !
i want to be with you .
settle down .
how' s your friend henry ?
what' s the matter ?
you don' t talk much .
talk .
what are you quiet for ?
you don' t eat much , you don' t talk much .
i' m just listening .
something wrong ?
when we were kids , the compares used to visit each other .
there was this man .
he would never talk .
he' d just sit there all night .
they say to him , " what' s the matter ?
don' t you say anything ?
he says , " what am i going to say , that my wife two times me ?
so she says , " shut up !
you' re always talking !
but in italian , it sounds much nicer .
cornuto contento .
that' s it .
it means he' s content to be a jerk .
he doesn' t care who knows it .
did tommy tell you about my painting ?
look at this .
it' s beautiful .
one dog goes one way and the other goes the other .
one' s facing east , the other west .
he' s saying , " what do you want from me ?
the guy' s got a nice head of white hair .
beautiful .
the dog looks the same .
looks like someone we know .
without the beard .
it' s him .
it' s him .
what the fuck is that ?
for most of the guys , killings were accepted .
murder was the only way everybody stayed in line .
you got out of line , you got whacked .
everybody knew the rules .
sometimes , even if people didn' t get out of line , they got whacked .
hits became a habit .
guys would argue over nothing .
before you knew it , one was dead .
they were shooting each other all the time .
shooting people was a normal thing .
it was no big deal .
we had a serious problem with billy batts .
this was really a touchy thing .
tommy killed a made guy .
batts was part of the gambino crew and considered untouchable .
before you touched a made guy , you needed a good reason .
you had to get an okay ... ... or you' d get whacked .
saturday night was for wives , but ... ... friday night at the copa was for the girlfriends .
we saw sammy davis , jr .
you got to see this show .
what a performer !
he does impersonations .
it was like the real people !
unbelievable .
you could see how a white girl could fall for him .
what ?
not me .
but you could see how some girls could .
like that swedish girl .
so you condone that stuff .
take it easy .
i don' t want to be kissing nat king cole over here .
i don' t mean me .
but , you know , he' s got personality .
personality ?
he' s talented .
i understand what you' re saying .
but watch what you say .
people get the wrong impression .
i just said he was talented .
just leave it alone now .
he' s talented .
leave it at that .
pretend you don' t see her , my heart
although she is coming
our way
pretend you don' t need her
my heart
but smile and pretend
to be gay
it' s too late for running
my heart
chin up if the tears
start to fall
look somewhere above her
pretend you don' t love her
pretend you don' t see her
at all
no ?
not even uncle paulie ?
what did you hear about that thing ?
the brooklyn thing ?
the guy from downtown .
the guy from where christie lived ?
the guy who disappeared , the one they made the beef on .
know the guy i mean ?
his name was batts .
his people are driving everyone crazy looking for him .
nobody knows what happened .
he came into the joint that night and then just disappeared .
keep your eyes open .
they' re busting my balls over it .
okay , everybody , let' s eat .
i want my money .
i want my money .
he owes it .
you know that thing we took care of upstate ?
paulie was talking about that .
we must move it .
they just sold the property to make condominiums .
it' s been six months .
we got to move it right away .
henry , hurry up .
my mother' s making fried peppers and sausage for us .
here' s an arm .
very funny .
here' s a leg .
here' s a wing .
what do you like , the leg or the wing ?
or you still go for the hearts and lungs ?
oh , that' s so bad .
what happened to the car ?
i hit a skunk , all right ?
go with your mother .
it' s disgusting , henry .
i set up janice in an apartment near the suite .
that way i was able to stay over a few nights a week .

jimmy and tommy were going to tampa this weekend to pick up something for me .

we' il have a good time .
when you come back , you' il go back to karen .

she' il never divorce him .
she' il kill him , but not divorce him .

i can' t .
let' s go .
we' il throw the bastard to the lions .
lions ?
i ain' t going near any lions !
throw him over the moat .
i' il get the money !
they must really feed each other to the lions , ' cause he gave the money right up .
i' il get the money .
we spent the rest of the weekend at the track .
they mean business .
then , i couldn' t believe what happened .
when we got home , we were all over the newspaper .
at first i didn' t even know why we got picked up .
then i found out the guy we roughed up ... ... had a sister working as a typist for the fbl .
i couldn' t believe it .
of all people .
she gave up everybody .
jimmy , me .
even her brother .
it took the jury six hours to bring us in guilty .
the judge gave us ten years , like he was giving away candy .
ten years in a federal penitentiary .
you will now be turned over ... ... to the u. s. attorney general .
toast , guys .
good trip , good life .
get out soon .
good trip , sweetheart .
we' il watch the home front .
say hello to those blow job hacks .
motherfuck them every chance you get .
i' il call you when i get a chance .
now take me to jail .
in prison , dinner was always a big thing .
we had a pasta course , then we had a meat or a fish .
paulie did the prep work .
he was doing a year for contempt ... ... and had a wonderful system for garlic .
he used a razor and sliced it so thin ... ... it would liquefy in the pan with a little oil .
it was a very good system .
vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce .
get that smell ?
three kinds of meat in the meatballs : veal , beef , and pork .
you got to have pork .
that' s the flavor .
i felt he used too many onions , but it was still a very good sauce .
don' t put too many onions in the sauce .
i didn' t put too much onions in , paul .
there are only three small onions .
three onions ?
how many tomatoes ?
two big cans .
you don' t need three onions .
johnny dio did the meat .
we had no broiler , so he did everything in pans .
it smelled up the joint and the hacks used to die ... ... but he cooked a great steak .
how do you like yours ?
medium rare .
medium rare .
an aristocrat .
when you think of prison you get pictures in your mind ... ... of all those old movies with rows and rows of guys behind bars .
it wasn' t like that for wiseguys .
it wasn' t bad , but i missed jimmy , who was doing his time in atlanta .
give me two steaks .
everyone else in the joint was doing real time , all together , living like pigs .
but we lived alone .
we owned the joint .
we batted them sons of bitches .
you couldn' t recognize them .
they deserved it .
even the hacks we couldn' t bribe wouldn' t rat on the guys we did .
people used to be able to leave their doors open .
sorry it took so long .
that skinny guard' s a pain in the ass .
we have to take care of that bastard .
i took care of him .
what' d you bring ?
some bread .
i got peppers and onions .
salami , prosciutto , a lot of cheese .
what else ?
scotch .
nice .
red wine .
okay .
now we can eat .
some white , too .
beautiful .
okay , boys , let' s eat .
come on , johnny , vinnie .
tomorrow we eat sandwiches .
you got to go on a diet , vinnie .
read ' em and weep .
what are you doing ?
i' il catch you guys later .
going for a walk in the park ?
i' il catch you next week .
thanks .
is there any more ?
no , that' s it .
have a good weekend .
you girls stay right here .
hold hands .
go right up front .
what ?
i saw her name on the register .
want her to visit you ?
let her stay up all night crying and writing to the parole board .
what am i doing here ?
where am i ?
i' m in jail .
i can' t stop people from visiting me .
let her sneak this stuff in for you every week .
let her fight these bastards every week !
look what you' re doing !
stop it !
i' m sorry .
let her sneak this shit in for you .
will you stop it ?
let her do it !
stop it !
nobody' s helping me .
i am all alone .
belle and morrie are broke .
i asked your friend remo for the money he owes you .
he told me to take the kids down to the police station and get on welfare .
it' s going to be okay .
i' ve never seen paulie since he got out .
i never see anyone .
that' s what happens when you go away .
we' re on our own .
forget everybody else .
forget paulie .
as long as he' s on parole he doesn' t want anybody doing anything .
i can' t do it .
yes , you can .
all i need is for you to bring me this stuff .
a guy in here from pittsburgh will help me move it .
in a month we' il be fine .
we won' t need anybody .
i' m afraid .
i' m afraid if paulie finds out ...
he is not helping us out .
is he putting any food on the table ?
we' ve got to help each other .
we got to be really , really careful while we do it .
i don' t want to hear about her anymore .
never .
we missed you .
are you here to stay ?
did you see our pictures ?
i did the one with the house and rainbow .
i did the sun .
my chorus concert is in two weeks .
are you coming ?
do you like the house ?
get packed .
we' re moving out .
with what ?
don' t worry .
just start looking for a new house .
i got to go to pittsburgh .
those guys owe me $15, 000 .
we' il be okay .
i got things lined up .
pittsburgh ?
you have to see your parole officer .
don' t worry about it .
everything will be fine .
who wants to go to uncle paulie' s ?
what do you want ?
sweetheart , let mommy eat .
you look good .
did you eat this good in the joint ?
i don' t want any more of that shit .
what are you talking about ?
just stay away from the garbage .
inside , you did what you had to do .
i' m talking about now .
from here and now .
why would i get into that ?
don' t make a jerk of me .
just don' t do it .
don' t do it .
i want to talk about jimmy .
watch out for him .
he' s a good earner , but he takes too many chances .
i wouldn' t take chances like jimmy .
tommy' s a good kid , but he' s crazy .
he' s got too much to prove .
you got to watch out for them .
i only use them for certain things .
i ain' t going to get fucked like gribbs .
gribbs is 70 years old and he' il die in prison .
i don' t need that .
so i' m warning everybody .
could be my son , could be anybody .
gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello to some fuck who was selling junk .
that won' t happen to me , understand ?
you' re out early because i got you a job .
i don' t need this heat .
you see anybody with shit you tell me .
anybody .
all right .
yeah ?
yeah .
of course .
it took me a week of sneaking around to unload the pittsburgh stuff .
but when i did , it was a real score .
i used sandy' s place to mix the stuff .
even with sandy snorting more than she mixed , i saw this was a good business .
i made $1 2, 000 in my second week .
i had a down payment on my house and things were rolling .
all i had to do was once in a while tell sandy i loved her .
it was perfect .
as long as i got the stuff from pittsburgh , paulie would never find out .
within a couple of weeks it got so big i needed some help .
i got jimmy and tommy to come in with me .
it' s fucking great .
you bring your pay slips ?
four and a half months of dirt .
it' s so good .
i did it .
do you love it ?
it' s wonderful .
this we had to have made special .
go ahead , sit in it .
the others you couldn' t even sit in .
okay , ready ?
watch the wall with the rock .
the electricians did it special .
come on .
this was imported .
it came in two pieces .
do you believe what they can do ?
nice , huh ?
come here .
did you and jimmy talk ?
he' s looking into everything .
it' il make the air france hold look like peanuts .
come on .
he' il do it , right ?
i told you .
he' s looking into it .
we' il see what happens .
no promises .
do you understand ?
there' s millions in there .
i' ve been cultivating this son of a bitch for two years .
he owes me 20 grand .
once in a lifetime .
i could retire .
no more nut every week .
no more bullshit .
my dream comes true .
let' s get a drink .
these are the guys jimmy put together for what turned out to be ... ... the biggest heist in american history .
the lufthansa heist .
tommy and carbone would grab the guard and make him get us in the front door .
frenchy and joe buddha had to round up the workers .
johnny roastbeef had to keep them tied up and away from the alarms .
even stacks edwards got in on it .
he used to play guitar at the lounge .
everybody loved stacks .
he was supposed to steal the panel truck ... ... and afterwards compact it by a friend of ours in jersey .
only morrie was driving us nuts .
have a drink and shut up .
just because he set this up ... ... he bugged jimmy for an advance on the money we were going to steal .
he didn' t mean anything by it .
that' s just the way he was .
i had everyone working for me .
even our old baby sitter , lois byrd .
have a good flight ?
i hate pittsburgh .
they' re such creeps .
they' re not that bad .
and it' s worth it , isn' t it ?
is this the same baby you used last week ?
no , that was my sister' s .
this is deirdra' s .
big yawn .
she looks like you .
that' s what the stewardess said .
take it easy .
give me a break .
you got plenty .
you got all day .
let' s make it last , all right ?
take it easy .
i got to go .
where are you going ?
don' t start .
you know i got to go do this thing .
where are my keys ?
over there .
it' s a mess .
it' s like a pig pen .
why do you think i got you a dishwasher ?
fucks up my nails .
you got to be smart .
there' s enough powder here to put us away forever .
loosen up .
what are you doing ?
you don' t have to go anywhere .
make them wait .
nobody knows for sure how much was taken in the pre dawn raid ... ... at the lufthansa cargo terminal at kennedy airport .
the fbi says $2, 000, 000 , port authority police say $4, 000, 000 .
those sons of bitches ! ... from the scene of the heist at jfk .
it looks like a big one .
maybe the biggest this town has ever seen .
come here , you !
come here !
look at this genius .
this genius !
merry christmas , jimmy !
who' s this ?
this is my wife .
come here .
i want to show you something , jimmy .
isn' t she gorgeous ?
i bought it for my wife .
it' s a coupe .
i love that car .

the fat fuck ought to wear a sign .
i can' t believe this .
are you stupid ?
excuse me .
take it off .

didn' t i tell you not to get anything big or attract attention ?
one guy gets a caddy and one gets a $20, 000 mink .
i' il return it .
bring it back where you got it .
get it out of here .
understand ?
get it out of here !
this drink here is better than sex , babe .
i' m going to see stacks .

he' s so jealous .
if i even look at anyone else , he' il kill me .

lufthansa should have been our ultimate score .

six million in cash .
more than enough to go around .

he ain' t ready .
i knew you wouldn' t be ready .
you didn' t bring any coffee ?

stacks was always crazy .
instead of getting rid of the truck as he was supposed to , he got stoned ... ... went to his girlfriend' s , and by the time he woke up , the cops had found the truck .
it was all over the television .
they even said they got prints off the wheel .
it was just a matter of time before they got to stacks .
i got to talk to you .

have a drink .
come on .
have a drink .
what are you doing ?
it' s an occasion .

i still have to talk to you .
what happened with stacks ?
don' t worry about that .
there' s feds all over the place .
so what ?
where are they going to go ?
it' s in the papers .
he' s worried .
what are you worried about ?
the television and the newspapers .
all the shit' s out there .
what are you worried about ?
you worry too much .
everything is beautiful .
didn' t you tell him ?
not yet .

guess what ?
they are going to make him .
paulie' s going to make you ?
they opened up the books .
paulie got the okay .

now will you keep you mouth shut ?
morrie , you' il get your money .
you just got to stop busting balls .
all right .
you hear me ?
everything' s going to be fine .
oh , henry boy , the pipes , the pipes are calling
half mick , half guinea ?
i' il sing with an italian accent .
and down the glen , the glen and down the mountainside
the summer' s gone
and all the roses dying
i could see for the first time that jimmy was a nervous wreck .
his mind was going in eight different directions at once .
think morrie tells his wife everything ?
morrie ?
him ?
that' s when i knew jimmy was going to whack morrie .
that' s how it happens .
that' s how fast it takes for a guy to get whacked .
he' s a nut job .
he talks to everybody .
he' s always acting like a jerk .
nobody listens to what he says .
nobody cares what he says , he talks so much .
make sure you bring him here tonight .
okay ?
all right .
start like this .
sorry .
did i get you in the eye ?
stop breaking my balls .
i was just stalling for time .
i knew i had ' til eight or nine o' clock to talk jimmy out of killing morrie .
but meanwhile , as far as jimmy knew , i was going along with the program .
i pulled out his hair .
i bit him .
he' s out cold .
i' m enraged .
i wanted to kill this little fuck .
i walk away .
we start to go in this joint .
i don' t want to turn around .
jimmy' s doing this to me .
i don' t want to fucking turn around .
i don' t want to turn around .
he picks up his fucking head , he says , " ah ...
i said , " don' t say it !
jerkoff !
what are you going to do ?
what ?
i fucking fly at him !
i got him and i' m banging his head , banging his fucking face .
i' m pulling his hair out of his head .
i beat him to a pulp .
to a pulp i beat him .
he' s laying there full of fucking blood .
i' m out of breath .
forget about tonight .
forget about it .
it was a load off my mind .
he never knew how close he' d come to getting killed .
even if i told him he would have never believed me .
jimmy , could i talk to you now ?
you' re a pisser .
a real pisser .
want to talk now ?
okay , let' s talk .
i' ve never met a ball buster like you .
who loves you more than i do ?
i' d do anything for you .
except stop busting my balls .
let' s go have coffee .
want to go to the diner ?
we' il go to the diner on the boulevard .
which diner ?
rockaway boulevard .
it' s open 24 hours .
they got danishes ?
they got everything .
let' s pick up some danishes for belle .
hear about the points we were shaving up in boston ?
it' s terrific .
nunzio ...
i thought he' d never shut up .
what a pain in the ass .
what' il we do with him ?
chop him up and get rid of the car .
call me when you' re through .
frank , let' s chop him up .
all right .
where you going , you dizzy motherfucker ?
you said chop him up .

i got a better shot letting him drive .
the car' s cold .

what , warm it up ?
get out of here !
who is it ?

open up .
it' s belle .
let me in .
morris didn' t come home .
he' s missing .
i know something' s happened .
calm down .
he' s missing !
i know something happened .
he' s probably drunk and fell asleep somewhere .
in 27 years he' s never been away all night without calling .
something' s happened .
i know you know .
let me get changed .
i' il take you home then look for him .
i' ve been home !
i' ve been on the phone ...
he' s playing cards .
what' il i tell belle ?
who gives a fuck ?
tell her he ran off with some broad .
what do you care ?
watch this .
don' t fuck with them .
i' il bust their fucking balls .
don' t give them the satisfaction , the fucks .
come on , fuckos .
let' s go for a ride .
keep them up all night .
i' il see you later .
jimmy was cutting every link between himself and the robbery ... ... but it had nothing to do with me .
i gave jimmy the tip and he gave me some christmas money .
from then on , i kept my mouth shut .
i knew jimmy .
he had the cash .
it was his .
he kicked some money upstairs to paulie , but that was it .
it made him sick to turn the money over to the guys who stole it .
he' d rather whack them .
what did i care ?
i wasn' t asking for anything .
and jimmy was making nice money through my pittsburgh connections .
still , months after the robbery they were finding bodies all over .
when they found carbone in the meat truck , he was frozen so stiff ... ... it took them two days to thaw him out for the autopsy .
still , i never saw jimmy so happy .
he was like a kid .
we had money coming in through pittsburgh ... ... and even after a while , the lufthansa thing began to calm down .
jimmy was so happy that morning ... ... because this was the day tommy was being made .
jimmy was so excited , you' d think he was being made .
he must have made four calls to tommy' s house .
they had a signal set up so he' d know the minute the ceremony was over .
ma , where are you ?
here i am .
you' re home .
home ?
i' m leaving .
you look lovely .
i look good , huh ?
you look wonderful .
be careful .
congratulations .
i love you .
don' t paint any more religious pictures , please .
god be with you .
we always called each other goodfellas .
you' il like this guy .
he' s all right .
he' s a goodfella , one of us .
you understand ?
we were goodfellas .
wiseguys .
but jimmy and i could never be made because we had irish blood .
it didn' t matter my mother was sicilian .
to become a member of a crew you must be 100 percent italian ... ... so they can trace your relatives back to the old country .
it' s the highest honor they can give you .
it means you belong to a family and a crew .
it means nobody can fuck around with you .
also , you can fuck around with anybody , as long as they aren' t also a member .
it' s like a license to steal .
a license to do anything .
how many years since you were made ?
i' m an old timer .
thirty years ago .
brings back a lot of memories .
pike' s peak was a pimple then , wasn' t it ?
as far as jimmy was concerned , with tommy being made ... ... it was like we were all being made .
we would now have one of our own as a member .
who' s this ?
this is vinnie .
what happened ?
did we get straightened out ?
we had a problem .
we tried to do everything we could .
you know what i mean .
he' s gone , and we couldn' t do nothing about it .
what do you mean ?
he' s gone .
he' s gone .
that' s it .
i knew it !
i can' t fucking believe it .
they fucking whacked him .
fuck .
are you all right ?
it was revenge for billy batts , and a lot of other things .
that' s that .
there was nothing we could do about it .
batts was a made man and tommy wasn' t .
we had to sit still and take it .
it was among the italians .
it was real greaseball shit .
they even shot tommy in the face ... ... so his mother couldn' t give him an open coffin at the funeral .
i had a busy day .
i had to drop the guns off at jimmy' s ... ... to match some silencers he had .
i had to pick up my brother at the hospital ... ... and pick up some stuff for lois ... ... to fly down to some customers i had near atlanta .
right away i knew he didn' t want them and i' d be stuck for the money .
i bought them because he wanted them and now he didn' t want them .
what good are these ?
none of them fit .
i' m not paying for these !
i didn' t say a thing .
jimmy was so pissed off , he didn' t even say good bye .
the drugs are making your mind into mush !
i' il take ' em back .
my pittsburgh guys always wanted guns .
since i would see them in the afternoon , for a delivery ... ... i was pretty sure i' d get my money back .
oh , my god .
at the hospital , michael' s doctor wanted to put me in bed .
what happened to you ?
i almost got into an accident on the way here .
and i told him i was partying all night .
i' m fine .
get over here .
let me check you out .
he took mercy on me , gave me valium ... ... and sent me home .
my plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up karen .
there it is .
you see that helicopter right there ?
right up there .
i think it' s been following me all morning .
get the fuck out .
are you nuts ?
i' m telling you .
it' s the third time i' ve seen it .
at the hospital i saw it .
i had to make some stops .
i' ve seen it every time .
i' ve been all over town and i' ve seen it all day .
i was cooking dinner that night .
i had to start braising the beef and veal shanks for the tomato sauce .
it was michael' s favorite .
i was making ziti with gravy ... ... roasted peppers ... ... string beans with olive oil .
i had some beautiful cutlets ... ... that were cut just right ... ... that i was going to fry up as an appetizer .
so i was home for about an hour .
my plan was to start dinner early so i could unload the guns jimmy didn' t want .
then get the package for lois to take to atlanta later that night .
i kept looking out the window and saw that the helicopter was gone .
michael , keep an eye on the sauce .
stay here with your uncle michael .
i asked my brother to watch the sauce , and karen and i started out .
oh , god .
i see it .
look , it' s right there .
damn !
that' s it .
we got to get to your mother' s .
see , i told you .
it' s funny .
it' s not the end of the world .
we' re going to your mother' s .
tell your mother not to touch anything outside of the house .
nothing .
why didn' t you go to your mother' s house ?
everything' s gonna be all right this morning
let' s go shopping .
no , i' m not nuts , it' s been following me all fucking morning !
alright .
he thinks i' m paranoid !
i should bring him the helicopter , then we' il see how paranoid i am .
come on , let' s go inside .
yeah , it' s gone .
i don' t hear anything .
let' s go back to your mother' s .
they all right ?
they' re great .
didn' t i say you were paranoid ?
didn' t i tell him ?
yeah .
i need a hit .
want to see helicopters ?
come on , i' il show you helicopters .
i' ve seen enough helicopters for one day , thank you .
i had to get home and get the package ready for lois to take on her trip .
also , i had to get to sandy' s to give the package a whack with quinine .
plus , i knew sandy would get on my ass .
i had the cooking to finish , and i had to get lois ready for her trip .
it' s sandy .
what the fuck is this ?
she' s a pain in the ass .
when are you coming over ?
in an hour .
you staying tonight , right ?
i can' t .
i got my brother tonight .
come on , stop .
stop .
we' il talk about it later , okay ?
good bye .
hello ?
it' s me .
you ready ?
tell michael not to let the sauce stick .
henry says don' t let the sauce stick .
i' m stirring it .
listen , you know what to do ?
yeah , yeah .
don' t " yeah , yeah " me , lois !
this is important .
make sure you leave the house when you make the call .
understand me ?
call from an outside line .
i mean it !
jesus , you must think i' m dumb .
i know what to do .
you little hick , just make sure you do it !
you' re a pain .
hey !
just do it !
okay .
un fucking believable .
all of them .
every fucking girl in my life .
what' d he say ?
nothing .
what does she do after she hangs up ?
after everything i told her ?
after all her " yeah , yeah " bullshit ?
she calls from the house .
if anyone was listening they' d know everything .
they' d know a package was leaving my house and they' d have the flight number .
as soon as i got home , i started cooking .
i had a few hours until lois ' flight .
i told my brother to watch on the stove .
all day long the poor guy' s been watching helicopters and tomato sauce .
i had to drive over to sandy' s , mix the stuff , then get back to the gravy .
do you think you can come over , fuck me , then leave ?
got someplace better to go ?
don' t talk like that .
come on .
you all right ?
yeah .
you believe me ?
do you believe me ?
that' s the last one ?
yeah .
you lying son of a bitch !
i hate you !
please stop feeding the dog from the table ... ... from the plate on top of it .
stop it .
i have to .
you don' t have to .
i got to go home .
what do you mean you got to go home ?
we got to tape this stuff to your leg .
we got to go soon .
i got to go home and get my hat .
forget your fucking hat !
are you kidding me ?
i need a trip to rockaway because you want your hat ?
i got to have it .
it' s my lucky hat .
i never fly without it .
do you understand what we are involved in ?
i don' t care .
i need my hat .
i won' t fly without it .
what could i do if she insisted i drive her home for her damn hat ?
i hid the package and went to take her home .
a hat ?
what the fuck is this ?
police !
freeze !
don' t move , motherfucker !
i' il blow your brains out !
shut the car off slowly !
i thought i was dead , but when i heard all the noise i knew they were cops .
only cops talk that way .
don' t fucking move .
if they had been wiseguys , i wouldn' t have heard a thing .
i would have been dead .
michael !
lock the door !
talk to me .
when was the last time you took a collar ?
i' m talking to you .
you don' t want to say a fucking word , don' t .
i don' t give a fuck .
you' il do 25 years .
see how much of a good guy you' il be then .
all day i thought the guys in the helicopter ... ... were local cops busting my balls over lufthansa .
they turned out to be narcs .
just get the lawyer .
they' d been on me a month .
phone taps , surveillance , everything .
you know the boys .
all the pals are here .
you don' t want to talk to me , you' il have a fucking problem all night .
each one of these counts holds 25 to life in new york state .
25 fucking years , pal .
i' il slap your fucking head inside out .
what , were you guys grocery shopping ?
are we going to make a cake ?
you going to make a fucking cake ?
you got anything good in there ?
is it good ?
bye bye , dickhead .
see you in attica , dick .
i spoke to jimmy .
he offered to give me some money .
he wants to know what' s happening .
he just wants to talk to you .
fuck jimmy and his money !
i got to straighten out everything with paulie or i' m dead .
then you' re better off staying in here .
they could whack me in here as easy as outside .
they' re afraid i' il rat them out .
people are already walking away from me .
i' m dead in here .
you got to get me out .
karen finally got her mother to put her house up for my bail and i was out .
i remember i had this feeling i would be killed right outside the jail .
i knew paulie was still pissed at me and he' s such a hothead .
and i was worried about jimmy .
see , jimmy knew if paulie found out he was in the drug deals with me ... ... paulie would have jimmy whacked even before me .
this is the bad time .
i didn' t feel safe until i got home .
now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope ... ... the cops never found , then disappear until things got straightened out .
fuck !
where' s the stuff i left , karen ?
i flushed it down the toilet .
what ?
what was i supposed to do ?
that was worth $60, 000 !
i need that money !
that' s all we got !
they had a search warrant !
that' s all the money we had !
i was depending on that !
why did you do that ?
i had to !
they were going to find it !
they wouldn' t have found it !
they would have !
i swear !
they would' ve found it !
why did you do that ?
they would have found it .
why did you do that ?
oh , my god !
i had to do it .
oh , my god !
paulie , i' m really sorry .
i don' t know what else to say .
i know i fucked up .
yeah , you fucked up .
but i' m all right now .
i can be trusted now .
i' m clean .
on my kids , i' m clean .
you looked in my eyes and lied to me .
you treated me like a fucking jerk .
like i was never nothing to you .
after what you said , i couldn' t come to you .
you know , i was ashamed .
i' m ashamed now .
but i got nowhere else to go .
you' re all i got .
and i really , really need your help .
i really do .
take this .
and now i' ve got to turn my back on you .
thirty two hundred bucks .
that' s what he gave me . $3, 200 for a lifetime .
it wasn' t even enough to pay for the coffin .
we got to get out .
i don' t want to run .
am i supposed to pick up and leave everything ?
go hiding ?
i don' t want to do that .
if we stay around here we' re dead .
you got it ?
we ' re dead .
they' re right .
you took too much of that stuff .
you' re totally paranoid .
how' s he doing ?
he' s okay .
they sobered him up .
good .
glad to hear it .
what kind of questions they been asking ?
i don' t know .
i got my mind on so many other things .
i got no money .
the girls are old enough to read the newspapers .
tell him he' s got to call me .
as soon as you talk to him , he' s got to call me .
it' s important .
he doesn' t know i came here to see you .
it' s like he' s crazy .
take this .
it' s a couple thousand .
thanks , jimmy .
don' t worry , everything will be all right .
i got some beautiful dior dresses .
you want to have them ?
pick out a few for yourself .
for my mom .
yeah , whatever .
not here .
in the store on the corner .
it' s swag , so i got it down on the corner .
go ahead , sweetheart , i' il see you .
thanks .
don' t worry .
i' il try .
he' s got to call me .
over here ?
right down there .
it' s over there , on the corner .
right there .
no !
go ahead !
it' s right there !
no , jimmy !
i' m in a hurry !
my mom' s watching the kids !
i got to get home !
i' il come back later !
what happened ?
nothing .
what happened ?
i just got scared .
got the keys ?
what happened ?
i just got scared .
it' s okay .
are you all right ?
if you' re part of a crew nobody ever tells you they' re going to kill you .
it doesn' t happen that way .
there aren' t any arguments or curses like in the movies .
your murderers come with smiles .
they come as your friends .
people who cared for you all your life .
they always seem to come when you' re weakest and most in need of their help .
so i met jimmy in a crowded place we both knew .
i got there 15 minutes early and jimmy was already there .
he took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up .
he wanted to make sure i wasn' t tailed .
he was jumpy .
he hadn' t touched a thing .
on the surface , everything was supposed to be fine .
we were supposed to be discussing my case .
but i had a feeling jimmy was trying to sense if i' d rat on him to save my neck .
i been telling you your whole life , don' t talk on the phone .
now you understand ?
it' s going to be okay .
you got a good chance to beat this case .
well , you know that kid from the city we were talking about ?
you know ?
the kid turned out to be a rat .
as soon as he got pinched , he ratted on everybody .
i know where he is .
he' s hiding out .
know what i' m saying ?
would you have a problem going with anthony to take care of that ?
no , not at all .
that way they got nothing .
jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before .
but now he' s asking me to go to florida and do a hit with anthony .
that' s when i knew i would never have come back from florida alive .
wherever you move me , i asked once and i' il tell you again ... ... i don' t want to go any place cold .
you don' t have a choice .
come on .
whoever fucking controls it ... ... just no place cold .
do that for me .
he' s bronchial , that' s why .
if he' s bronchial we' il consider that .
i' d like to go someplace not cold .
can i ask you some questions ?
what about my parents ?
what about them ?
am i going to see them ?
am i going to talk to them ?
don' t i have some kind of contact with them ?
no .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
you mean to tell me ... ... if something happens to my parents and they get sick , i can' t see them ?
maybe something can be worked out if they' re sick .
if there' s extraordinary circumstances ...
i can' t do this .
i can' t do this , henry .
i can' t leave my parents .
karen , i told you before .
i' m not going to do this unless you and the kids come with me .
i can' t do it without you .
so you do whatever , but ... that' s it .
you need henry , not me , right ?
that' s right .
i don' t care whether you go or not .
if it' il make him a better witness , i want you with him .
they don' t want me .
henry' il be in the protection program .
they can' t get to him .
they can only get to him by getting to you or your kids .
if he goes into the program you' re in danger .
i don' t know anything .
don' t give me ... ... the babe in the woods routine .
i' ve listened to those wiretaps and i' ve heard you talk about cocaine .
conversation after conversation you talked to henry on the phone .
it doesn' t matter .
whether he goes to jail ... ... or stays on the streets , he' s a dead man .
he knows it and you know it .
what about the kids and school ?
i mean , what goes on ?
go to wall street and get real crooks .
whoever sold you those suits had a sense of humor .
what it comes down to is we' re your only salvation .
we' il save your life , his life , and we' il keep you out of jail .
this morning you told the jury about your background .
it was easy for us to disappear .
my house was in my mother in law' s name .
my cars were registered to my wife .
my social security cards and driver' s licenses were phonies .
i never voted or paid taxes .
my birth certificate and arrest sheet were all that showed i was alive .
do you see him here in this courtroom ?
yes .
will you please point him out for the jury ?
let the record show that mr. hill identified the defendant , james conway .
do you also know a man named paul cicero ?
do you see him in the courtroom ?
yes .
can you point him out for the jury ?
let the record show mr. hill identified the defendant paul cicero .
i have a document ...
the hardest thing was leaving the life .
i still loved the life .
we were treated like movie stars with muscle .
we had it all .
our wives , mothers , kids , everybody rode along .
i had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen .
i had a bowl of coke next to my bed .
people call them rats because they will do anything to survive .
objection !
objection sustained .
i know nothing about being a rat .
you know everything about it !
anything i wanted was a phone call away .
free cars .
keys to a dozen hideouts all over the city .
i' d bet 20 grand over a weekend ... ... then blow the winnings in a week or go to sharks to pay the bookies .
didn' t matter .
it didn' t mean anything .
when i was broke i would go rob some more .
we ran everything .
we paid off cops .
we paid off lawyers .
we paid off judges .
everybody had their hands out .
everything was for the taking .
and now it' s all over .
that' s the hardest part .
today everything is different .
there' s no action .
i have to wait around like everyone else .
can' t even get decent food .
after i got here i ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce ... ... and i got egg noodles and ketchup .
i' m an average nobody .
i get to live the rest of my life like a schnook .
