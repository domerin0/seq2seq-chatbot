but they were just amateurs .
even my bro naive .
give these to dad but do not tell him it' s from me .
hairy , come and see what i' ve got !
we came to the city of god to find paradise .
lot of people were homeless due to the floods ... and the fire they set on ghetto .
they are going to bring electricity !
the big bosses however didn' t like the homeless .
without electricity, without roads, without busses .
the rich people ...
they don' t give a damn about us
it has nothing to do with the rio de janeiro you see in postcards .
do you think i am going to be a lifeguard when i grow up ?
i don' t know .
it is better to be a lifeguard than a fisherman .
i don' t want to be a fisherman , i will stink .
are you insulting your father ?
no .
what do you want to become ?
i sure don' t want to be a gangster or a cop .
i do not want to get killed .
drop it, kid .
are you pointing a gun at me ?
the kid is with me .
i am a gangster too .
not many bottles in it .
we rob trucks every day .
we have to hit a rich house to get out of here .
no , you have to follow my plan .
look who' s talking !
he is so stoned , he doesn' t know what he is talking about !
you are both not as worthy as the kid .
what are you thinking, kid ?
the gun doesn' t make you a robber .
you need ideas .
the kid had ideas .
is this the motel ?
we get the money and leave .
no killings !
give it to me .
leave me alone !
don' t you give this shit to me !
you' re acting like a baby .
here' s yours .

do not be hasty . you' re staying here to look out .
if you see cops , shoot that window .
why doesn' t he stay in the look out ?
this was my plan .
he is good for nothing !

a whole car runs into a bar ... and noone saw a thing ?

what' s up , shortie ?
they are hiding in the woods .
i think they are hiding in the woods .
they are in the woods .
fillipe , lock the car .
rantzel , come with me .

how do they see ?
they stole a fortune from the motel ...
what if we took the money ?
are you out of your mind ?
i do not want any trouble .
i just want to eliminate them .
since when is it a crime to steal from niggers and robbers ?
i know a snitch in the city .

i worked for my father .
fathers say bullshit .
i' m leaving . i do not want to die .
i am not ment to be a gangster .
the cops are down there .
i don' t care .
i am going back to the church .
i am the resurrection and the life ..
he that believeth in me , though he were dead, yet shall he live ..
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me .. shall never die ...
stop , or i' il shoot !
he that believeth in me , though he were dead, yet shall he live ..
the robbery in the motel was the most bloodstained in history .
the gangsters fortunes changed paths .
he must not have been a gangster .
he is a worker .
snatcher was in god' s hands .
hairy was caught in the net of bernice .
and naive was in my father' s hands .
why are you doing this ?
you will be wotking with me !
your brother is going to look after you .
if i ever catch you with money that is not yours, i' il kill you !
this goes for you too .
put on the work wear !
if your brother is a gangster you are affected as well !
don' t worry .
he will get over it .
these things are not for you !
you go and study .
aren' t you affraid of being killed ? you are smart , you have to go to college .
i attend school beacuse i do not like working .
promise me that you are never gonna touch this weapon .
quickly . i will sell lots of fish . do not laugh !
you smiled when father hit me .
what' s wrong ?
cat got your tongue ?
i' m thinking how to tell you .
you' re gonna fry your brain if you think so much .
my heart chose you .
i am listening to my heart .
are you kidding ?
have you never head of love at first sight ?
gangsters do not love .
you always talk to me in a bad way .
gangsters seduce . i am not going to lose my peace .
gangsters do not stop just take a break .
you know nothing of love .
this is no love it is a joke .
i love you .
you might convince me in the end .
after the robbery, police did raids in the ghetto .
everyday, someone was sent to jail , someone was sold out .
but noone ever knew anything .
noone revealed the robbers hideout .
three months later
why don' t you change life , hairy ?
find a job instead of lying in bed all day !
do you think that a job will give you money ?
go try !
what do you think i am doing all day long ?
take it easy, baby .
all i want is you . to have children, a farm with chicken, and lots of weed .
i do not believe a word .
i almost got rich with that robbery .
police is after you after the motel killings .
what are you saying ? did you see anything ? so shut up !
they shot them , and blamed it to me !
they even killed kid ! so leave it !
i don' t know who did it not me . i do not a gangster as the father of my children !
you are alone, hairy !
snatcher became religious , naive found a job .
anf you ?
i am the same !
everybody dumped me .
then i will dump you too .
i am leaving . if you want, come with me, else i will leave alone !
nice fresh fish !!
my brother promised to conform .
but the gangster does not change .
just stops for a while .
naive was having an affair with shortie' s wife .
i have trout, but for you i have something special .
it' s a mullet .

my father sweared not to see my brother again .
noone saw him again in the ghetto .
trio mortes story reached its end .
kid ! i though you were killed in the motel .
i can see you got money .
it' s ours, benny .
cut the crap and bring the money .
tell hairy that shortie is getting hard . i' m leaving
but, shortie was busy
a neighbour call the cops before sunrise .
a husband burries his wife alive in the city of god
the place was full of cops .
the robbers run away .

i would do anything for her .
i would find pot, coke ...
i would go to the big ones to buy good stuff ..
blackie .

who are things going ?
the kids ok ?
do you want to buy or smoke ?
who is it ?
this was blackies hideout but not since ever .
fuck off kid why are u marching in like that ?
is this your hideout ?
the story of the hldeout
donan zel after becoming a widow she started to sell drugs .. to feed her children .
she often gace out dope to the kids with exchange .
her favourite was the big guy .
she was such an amateur that even big guy was cheating on her .
big guy was using kids as dealers .
my pot ?
stick it in your ass .
the best dealer ..
was redhead .
may i have a sip ?
big guy trusted him and so he became a manager . twenty for us five for you, blackie .
some day a friend of redhead appeared .
aristotle .
my wife is sick .
his family had helped redhead .
he would not refuse help to a brother .
the dope . i want the money till friday .
you put me out of jail .
he is a friend, big guy .
give him another week .
you either kill him or i' il kill you .
he had no choice .
i told you on friday .
do not do it friend .
redhead wanted to get the big guy .. but he did not have to .
big guy died in jail .
redhead took the belongings of big guy .. but not the hideout .
it was cursed .
he gave it to his trustee blakie . hundred fifty bags .
not enough .
so he took over the local dealing .
but not for long .
who is it ?
go see .
fuck off kid . why are you rushing into my hideout ?
who told you it is yours ?
and i am not kid .
my name is ze .
the story of llttle ze
ze wanted to rule the city of god .. since he was a kid .
they are having fun and i am not ?
i want to go .
what do you want ?
your friend took it all .
that night, kid satisfied his thirst for blood . knowing that hairy would never forgive him .
to save himself he left the city of god .
he worked all day for nickels .
kid and benny really made it ..
they had the gift of the killer .
you have more . i had the idea . the problem was to handle an older gangster .
like my brother goose .
damnit ! i though you died in the motel you have lots of money !
it is our money, benny .
benny, tell hairy that shortie is getting hard .
i' m leaving the ghetto .
from hairy .
you are gonna need it .
robbery after robbery the kid grew big .
in his 18s he was the most respected gangster in the city
one of the most dangerous robbers in rio .
happy birthday kid .
glad you turned 18 .
beat it !
just a beer !
didn' t you see me asshole ?
next time , i will kill you prick !
kid was ready for everything !
and couldn' t wait .
whos is the wealthiest here ?
lots .
jerry andriani ..
golden necklace, luxurious clothes .
perriera and the chick .
my brother took her .
look at the race .
here is blackie .
full of gold .
redhead . nice wheels !
all of the dealers .
all of them wealthy .
robberies and shit . the big money is in drug dealing .
especialy coke .
needs capital though .
we will kill them and take over .
when do we start now .
the light of satan brought you here !
why do you live in the city of god that god has forgotten ?
i know what you want . you want power . i have something that wiil give you the power you' re looking for . that will change tour fate .
i give you my amullet .
just do not fuck while you wear it ..
because you will die !
the kid will no longer be kid but ze .
little ze grew up .
if you help me i will help you .
this way kid became ze and started the killings .
one morning he took over andriani' s gang ..
till the night, he ruled all the ghetto gangs .
he did not harm redhead since he was bennie' s friens .
only the hideout was left . but it was an easy job .
who is it ?
fuck off kid . why are you rushing into my hideout ?
since when is it your hideout ?
anything wrong kid ?
i am not kid .
my name is ze !
you' re dead bastard .
no, he understands .
all yours i want nothing i do not want trouble .
i had to take vegeance on my brother' s death .
you are gonna live but you will work for us .
easy to say .
where are you going ?
he' s clean ze .
waht is your name ?
rocket
naive' s brother .
dead naive' s brother .
go and tell everyone that ze is now in charge .
we are selling coke .
got it ?
drug dealing is a job too ! the supplier brings the merchantise which is packed .
all is a chain .
pot is wrapped . coke is packed in 10s or 100s .
you can be a carrierist drug dealer .
the kids start as messengers .
then they do lookouts .
if the cops come they all vanish .
then you become a dealer .
in hard times the dealer vanishes .
growing up , you become captain .
and if you are good in math, you become a manager .
bosses right hand .
the cops get their cut and stay out of it .
whan ze came , all the rivals stopped in the city .
you could go there .
bohemian people bought their dope safely .
lots of people became addicts and ze became rich .
which one should i wear ?
this is cool .
if drug dealing was legal ze would be given an oscar .
i thought that all these are very dangerous .
however he was everywhere .
if i needed pot i had to visit redhead .
half a pound .
thanks .
it was woth it .
i smoked it with angelica .
she had broken up with siago and so i made my move .
fantastic photos .
do i look good here ?
you look good in all of them .
twilight, an empty beach , a long lasting kiss ..
that was it ...
but the shorties came ...
will you give me a splif ?
here .
see you later .
your joint !
keep it !
first time i met the shorties .
steak and potatoes .
this is for you .
all of it ? thanks .
do you want to have something to eat ?
can you change the time in the clock please ?
after he broke up, siago sniffed more and more everyday .
when you become an addict , you' re in the dealer' s hands .
two bags of ten .
one bag .
for siago it waa not like that .
sorry , godfather .
bullshit , did i baptize you ?
give me your bike , blackie .
do you wanna race ?
till the bus .
ready ? go !
hard race .
you' re good .
where did you buy the triners from ?
from the neighborhood .

shorts and shirt ?
buy whatever you can .
what is your size ?

benny ! did you get the goodies ?
just a pair of trousers ?
there is more .
do you like it ?

keep it .
this is benny .
i became bohemian .
gangsters, listen .
beware ...
groovies are making moves before the big boom .
fuck you, bastards !
prick !
redhead is placing the ghetto in danger .
go talk to him . you can' t just shoot everybody .
don' t worry , the lads here are ok .
i don' t worry !
will you dance , benny ?
what happened with the redhead ?
go talk to him !
benny was the coolest gangster in the city .
he gave away dope , paid for his drinks .
ze was the opposite .
he was obsessed .
wanted to become the big ghetto boss .
he was looking for the opportunity to take over redhead' s gang .
don' t let the shorties rob the whole ghetto .
you mind your business and i will mind mine .
i' m going for a drink .
how is it going rocket ?
siago , what' s up ?
want to dance ?
can we go to your palce ?
my parents are not home .
you' re gonna be alone .
today you can lose your virginity !
don' t shout !
everyone will hear !
you' re pretty .
it' s ok .
i know you are related to the shorties .
do you think i am stupid ?
you want my gang ?
i just want to talk to you .
you are useless !
the shorties are endagering us .
ask them to cool down .
he lets them plunder in his ghetto, the useless .
if police come here we' re fucked .
i will do it because i like you .
change his dipers !
tell him that noone plunders in my ghetto !
shorties do not respect the ghetto rules .
they steal from ordinary people and rob bakeries .
you' re stealing from me all the time !
however, they didn' t know the city had a new boss !
thank you for preferlng us
the city has become safer fot the inhabitants .
robberies are rare .
all you have to do is visit ze .
do not touch shorties i don' t .
let' s go for a walk together ?
mom , i am going out with my friends .
i have never tasted a better chicken !
the old man was scared to death ! you feel sorry for him ?
should we rob a bank or a supermarket ?
bullshit . all the money is in drug dealing .
you have to start as a messenger .
it is no good . takes too much time to be promoted .
you have to wait for an old guy to get killed .
i won' t wait for anyone to bite the dust . i' il do as ze .
are you talknig about be kid ?
the boss is here .
