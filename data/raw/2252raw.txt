in spanish .
what' s the deal with dad ?
he wants to buy a truck of his own .
why ?
so you can work for yourselves .
munez and son , eh ?
that' s what he wants for us ?
there' s always plan b.
which one is that ?
the american dream .
we win the lottery .
what happened ?
he wants too much .
too bad .
you have to eat something .
hey .

i' ve been a busboy now for six months .
why can' t i be a waiter ?
this chinese restaurant .
you' re not chinese .

this is america .
you' re american , i' m american .
you have green card ?
if i had one , could i be a waiter ?
no .
you' re not chinese .
tommy .
hold your position .
tommy , you' re supposed to be on the wing .
it' s not the cup final .
he' s seven years old .
you' re never too young , val .
to be honest , i don' t think tom' s that into soccer .
that' s b ...
oh .
go .
hey .
watch out .
go on , tom .
thanks .
he' s quite a player .
yes , he is .
did you teach him to do that ?
god taught him .
he doesn' t look right .
his balance is all wrong .
doesn' t look up enough .
doesn' t lift his legs high enough .
that' s what all the other teams think .
then that happens .
well played , son .
do you ever play professional ?
well ... pro teams go for college kids and ... none of us went to college .
when' s your next game ?
saturday .
there' s someone i bumped into on the plane on the way over here .
i want him to see you play .
he' s a sports agent .
i' m serious .
i think you' re worth it , son .
listen , no offence , but i need to get to work .
i used to play a bit myself .
yeah ?

england .
i was a scout too .
i know what i' m talking about .
england ?
what' s your name , son ?
santiago munez .
glen foy .

man .
movie stars have agents .
what' s an agent supposed to do with you ?
do you know something ?
your boy' s really good .
he could be a star .
don' t you get it ?
there are two types of people in this world .
those that live in big houses and people like us , who cut their lawns and wash their cars .
that could change if i become a professional player .
what are you saying ?
you play in a park with a bunch of guys who work in a car wash .
i don' t know .
meet this guy and everything could change .
for the better .
i know how to make things better .
we buy a truck .
we make our own business .
the rest is rubbish .
another beer .
baseball , tennis , soccer , basketball .
all at the touch of a button .
experience the thrill of the game from the comfort of your home environment .
barry , is this a good moment ?
no time like the present .
so he' s a young mexican kid from the barrio .
he dazzled me , i tell you , barry .
as you know , i don' t dazzle easily .
the last time was a young kid called jermain defoe .
i' d rather not talk about that , glen .
so he' s playing on saturday afternoon .
some college downtown .
right , tell me exactly where it is and i' il be there 110 % .
glad to hear it .

maybe the old man is right .
you dare to dream , get screwed .
thanks anyway .
hello .
who is this ?
this is glen foy .
glen foy ?
do i know you , mr foy ?
uh ...
well , i was one of your scouts when you first took over .
you fired me , actually .
well , you brought in the new regime .
i don' t hold it against you .
oh , you don' t ?
so why are you calling me at half past three in the morning ?
sorry .
i' m in california .
i' ve just seen a young player .
i think he' s a remarkable talent .
who does he play for ?
oh , just local league .
kickabout stuff .
the point is , i' m on a plane home tomorrow and i want you to make me a promise .
if he turns up on your doorstep , will you see him ?
you want me to promise you this , right ?
aye .
just give him a run out .
that' s all i' m asking .
if i say yes , can i go back to sleep ?
yes , mr dornhelm .
then yes , mr foy .
santiago .
hey .
how are you doing ?
fine , thank you .
why are you here ?
your coach told me where to find you .
who' s this ?
the man from england who watched me play football .
if you get yourself to england , newcastle united will give you a trial .
newcastle united ?
that' s a big club .
a very big club .
what is this bullshit ?
you think you are going to play football in england ?
he thinks i' m good enough .
why you fill him with ideas like this ?
who the hell do you think you are ?
and you .
why don' t you keep your feet on the ground instead of your head in the sky ?
it' s a big thing you ask , senor .
he' s supposed to fly halfway across the world on something you say ?
the manager' s made me a promise .
he' il give him a trial .
the rest is up to him .
look in my eyes and answer me this .
grandma .
can santi make it as a professional ?
aye , i believe he can .
dad .
we' ve gotta go .
if the freeway' s busy , you' re gonna miss your flight .
here' s my card .
it' s all my numbers .
think about it .
give me a ring .
it' s good to meet you .
good to see you .
you got enough ?
enough what ?
everyone knows the money' s in the boot .
so are you going ?
grandma thinks i should .
what does dad think ?
i haven' t asked him .
how far away is england ?
right now ?
400 bucks too far .
go back to sleep .
now .
there ?
thanks .
how could you do this , dad ?
i paid 4500 for the truck .
i took 1200 of yours , but i' m giving you half the business .
that' s a good deal .
you stole that money .
stay out of this , mother .
you knew what it was for .
two more weeks and i have enough .
for what ?
to chase a stupid dream ?
big time ballplayer in england .
come on .
it' s bullshit .
and when you fail , how are you gonna come back with no papers ?
one chance , and you think i should just give it up for what you do ?
what i do is take care of my family .
in mexico , i work construction .
at night , i clean up in a brothel .
but i save enough to bring us to america .
and when your mother walk out on us ...
no .
when she walk out ,
i hold this family together .
leave her out of this .
i make enough for this house and now we have our own business .
that' s how things get better .
that' s how you measure a man' s life .
it' s your life .
not mine .
gavin .
gavin .
gavin .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a very good day for the club .
gavin is a very gifted player and should fit in very well with our set up here at st james ' park .
i' m very pleased to present him ... with this .
winning the league' s out of sight , erik .
what are your realistic goals for the rest of the season ?
finishing in the first four and qualifying for europe .
it' s essential for a club like this .
to do that , you' re gonna have to take maximum points from your next games .
look , the club has had some problems lately , yeah .
but ...
i' m here now , yeah .
and i' m not in it for fame or money or anything like that .
i like to win matches .
so maximum points shouldn' t be a problem .
eh , boss ?
where' s your father ?
he' s gone to get a part for the truck .
good .
he doesn' t have to hear this .
train ticket to san diego .
bus ticket to mexico city .
mexico city ?
yes .
you can' t fly to london from los angeles .
you' re illegal .
this is your ticket .
it' s dated one week from now .
grandma , how did you pay for this ?
i' ve worked all my life .
i have savings .
what did you sell ?
what did you hock ?
old things , from the past .
so now do i get a room to myself ?
come here .
who' s gonna help with your homework ?
you won' t do it .
he' il do it .
take a shower before you leave .
you smell real bad .
am i leaving tonight ?
sure .
before your father gets home .
when your mother walked out on us ,
i promised god i' d do everything to help you boys follow your dreams .
you deserve this chance , santiago .

nice one .
i hear some players have a problem with gavin harris .
divvent like his attitude .
aye .
well , three clubs in five years should tell you something .
i think he' s better playing on the inside .
if he' s in a mood , he gets lost out wide .
aye , right enough , like .
what are you looking at ?
sorry , but you' re talking about soccer , right ?
no .
football ?
oh , aye .

football' s a religion here .
london has any number of teams , same in the midlands .
manchester , you' ve got two , liverpool , you' ve got two , glasgow' s got two .
up here , though , it' s just the toon .
there she is .

erik dornhelm .
mr dornhelm .
he can be intimidating .
look him in the eye .
i don' t think my look will make a difference .
it' il be my feet .
mr dornhelm , excuse me .
glen foy .
this is the young man i was telling you about .
hi .

i' m sure you have a watch and i' m absolutely sure it' s an expensive one .
what time does it say ?
sorry , boss .
i was dropping a shirt off for a sick kid in hospital .
the pr people should have had a camera .

and today , you train with the reserves .
oh , f ...

thank you very much .
hey , i' il be around .
oh , you' re there .

mal braithwaite .

there' s not gonna be a tomorrow , santiago .
get in the car .
you know , my father believes people have a place in life .
you work , you feed your family .

and it' s foolish to think otherwise .
excuse me , sir ...
i had a word with the fellow on the door .
he said i could come in and just look for someone .
i won' t be a second .
mr dornhelm .
glen foy from this morning .
listen , i' m sorry to interrupt the proceedings .
have i missed all the boring speeches ?
i' m making one of the " boring " speeches .
this distraction is not welcome .
well , if you' d answered my calls , i wouldn' t be here .
what do you want ?
listen , this kid , santiago munez .
would you like to sit here ?
sure .
thanks .
listen , he' s grown up in poverty and hardship and his only way out is his skill with the ball .
he' s flown 6, 000 miles on my say so .
he' s jet lagged .
he' s nervous .
you know , he' s never seen mud before and you put him on a pitch like that .
and then you spend the whole time on your mobile .
i saw him flat on his ass most of the time .
yet there was one moment of magic .
when he took the ball on the bounce .
turned magowan .
took it down .
i saw it .
looks good .
hear they do you well here .
listen , when i was a scout ,
i used to spend the whole time , on muddy days , watching young lads clogging the shite out of each other , and just once in a while , there' d be one that' d come along and lift your heart .
like this lad .
just give him a month .
ah , so you found all my yesterdays ?
i was just looking .
my wife made this scrapbook .
you never told me you were a major league player .
aye .
well , not for as long as i' d have liked .
why ?
got an injury .
did my knee in .
look at that .
shorts were shorter , hair was longer .
didn' t make l8 million a year , either .
but you were still heroes .
oh , aye .
footballers have always been heroes , even in my father' s day , earning l8 a week and working down the mine at the same time .
there you go .
no , i can' t accept it .
it' s too special .
i' m not giving it to you .
just try it on .
i want to see what you look like in the black and white .
what' s the point ?
what' s the point ?
well , you' ve got a month' s trial .
better phone your granny again .
right , listen up , you lot .
this is santiago munez .
he' s from mexico .
no .
los angeles .
los angeles .
whatever .
before this day' s done , i want you to let him know who you are .
ok .
right , let' s get to it .
push it hard .
hard .
nice one , franny .
nice work .
come on .
15 .
16 .
17 .
come on , santiago .
santi , i' ve been to mexico once .
did you like it ?
gave me the shits for a week .
one day , son .
but not today .
come on , move .
thank you .
do you want to sit down , please ?
ok .
it may be a little high .
why' s that ?
well , ' cause you are so close and you smell nice .
it' s normal .
are you the club doctor ?
no , i' m his nurse .
he' il examine you soon .
did you fill in the paperwork ?
yeah .
just a couple of words i didn' t understand .
ok .
like what ?
like this one here .
that' s " cardiovascular " .
it means " heart problems " .
oh .
no .
no .
and how about that one ?
respiratory " do you have any problems with your lungs or breathing ?
do you ?
no .
do you wanna step on the scales ?
right .
what' s your name ?
nurse harmison .
i mean your first name .
you don' t need to know that .
you don' t need to know where i live , what my star sign is , or what i' m doing on saturday night .
i' m gonna have to take blood .
oh , man .
really ?
i don' t like needles .
but you have a tattoo , or is that a rub on transfer ?
that was a gang thing .
you were in a gang ?
not any more .
there' s only three ways to get out of a gang you get shot , you go to jail , or ...
in my case , you have a grandmother who kicks some sense into you .
sorry , tough guy .
what' s your problem ?
problem ?
what problem ?
come on .
ignore him .
he' s a tit .
walk away .
he' s a knobhead .
laughing at you , mate .
he' s a knobhead , mate .
hey , forget him .
knobhead ?
knobhead ?
come on .
let' s get a game going .
how long did they give you ?
a month .
a month ?
that' s not long .
at least i got six .
i was with tranmere rovers before this .
they signed me from school when i was 14 .
how' s it going ?
early days .
that' s gavin harris .
they just signed him for l8 million .
dining with the bum bandit today , are we , jamie ?
hughie magowan' s 33 .
unless every other centre back in the squad breaks his leg ,
he' il not play for the first team again .
why be so pissed with me ?
well , you' re the new kid on the block , son .
you' ve got something he never had flair .
flair ?
aye .
you know , most players , myself included , they play within themselves .
they play to their strengths so they don' t expose their weaknesses .
the great players , the ones with flair , they take risks , because they don' t believe they' re risks .
put your coat down here .
three and in .
you' re in .
all righty .
they control the ball , the ball doesn' t control them .
here .
look at this .
two jackets and a ball .
it' s all you need .
finished with that , son ?
yeah .
sorry .
sorry .
santi .
there you go .
hey , listen .
i could show you the town if you like .
tonight .
go clubbing .
bevvy .
women .
yeah .
uh ...
do i need an id or something ?
id ?
yeah .
identification ?
yeah .
how old do you have to be here to get a drink ?
eleven .
all right , gavin .
listen , mate , if you want an autograph , write to the club , you muppet .
listen , elvis , i' m with the club too .
mate , i' m with the club too , you know .
i' ve never seen you before .
i don' t go out much .
hey .
hey .
nurse harmison .
nurse harmison .
hi .
you wanna come into this club with us ?
no way .
it' s full of posers , that place .
yeah ?
where are you going ?
we' re going to the spyglass .
what do you say ?
yeah , yeah .
here we go , here we go .
canny wine , this rioja .
it' s from your part of the world , isn' t it ?
spain .
no , i' m from la .
i' m from merseyside .
la ?
and merseyside ?
what are you two doing up here ?
well ...
we play for newcastle .
i thought you said players were off limits .
relax .
they haven' t made the reserves yet .
well , as long as you' re mired in mediocrity , pet , you' re in with a chance .
i' m sorry , but i don' t know what that means .
it means don' t change .
don' t become something you' re not .
well , my life' s already changed , just by being here .
i grew up on a council estate with a dad on the dole and a mum on the booze .
change is fine with me .
i remember you now .
you' re the one with the toe .
what ?
you had fungus behind your big toenail .
what ?
did you have to mention that ?
oh , man .
i guess in your job , you must see the whole team naked ?
i know what you' re gonna say .
i' m not gonna ask who has the biggest .
ok , what were you gonna ask ?
who has the smallest ?
it must be you , because she cannot tell us .
go on .
come on .
mark him , mark him .
space , hit space .
stick with him .
remember what i told you .
here .
here .
ok , pass .
pass the ball .
pass it .
why didn' t you pass the ball , man ?
hey , mal .
munez .
come here .
hey , lads .
over here .
come on .
gather round .
hey , mal .
give me five minutes .
ok , boss .
thank you .
so when i say go , i want you to run as fast as you can to the goal .
ok ?
yeah .
go .
come back .
again .
go .
what did you learn ?
that you can score from halfway .
no .
that the ball can travel faster than you .
here , we pass the ball .
you understand that ?
we' re a unit , not a one man show .
the name on the front of the shirt is more important than the one on the back .
ok ?
yeah .
santi .
hey .
this is the final countdown for newcastle utd .
only three games left this season , and to qualify for europe in the champions league , and all the riches that go with that , they' il have to win them all starting today .
oh , man .
never an easy team to beat , chelsea .
well coached , well drilled .
they certainly are .
the game , yeah .
i' m with gavin' s girlfriend .
i' il call you back .
lads .
toon , toon .
black and white army .
toon , toon .
black and white army .
toon , toon .
black and white army .
how' s that possible ?
for all their possession , you have to say
newcastle haven' t yet created one clear cut chance .
he' s fading .
aye .
by a brilliant sense of positional play , he' s avoided contact with the ball .
well , maybe he' s playing hurt .
no , he' s hungover .
right , get him off .
shola .
now , this looks quite bad for newcastle .
the last thing they need is another injury .
they' ve already got several walking wounded out there .
number ten off , mate .
free kicks and get far post at corners .
wait a second .
it' s gavin harris who' s coming off .
what ?
me ?
he' s taking gavin off .
what the hell is he thinking about ?
what are you thinking about , you german twat ?
substitution for newcastle united .
what are you doing ?
sit down .
only five minutes left to play .
still no score .
chelsea still have the upper hand .
goal .
they' ve got one at last .
