the last slgn
looking back now ...
i see how easy was to fool myself thinking everything
so much pain for nothing .
we were taken by surprise .
we like to think that bad things can only happen to
after you died jeremy ...
i thought we may find peace in our lives again .
but death is not always as final as sometimes we think it
yes ?
mrs. macfarlane ?
we' re from the real state .
just a second , i' il get the key .
i' m so sorry , i can' t find the keys .
can we take a look from the outside ?
yes .
of course .
will you allow access to the garden ?
it' s a standard
i suppose it covers all possible options .
it' s just that i have children .
i' il have a look at the back .
excuse me .
i can' t do it anymore .
the kids and i are leaving .
you want to leave me ?
mrs. macfarlane ?
location is perfect .

he was talking to me .
i talked back !
why not ?
we do that all the time .
i' m throwing myself a birthday party on saturday ... so , why don' t you ... just come and let your hair down ?

there was nothing i could do .
i' m sorry .
we can' t live like this anymore .
that was good .
that was really good .
i' m telling you .
the man' s party went all night long .
you should have joined them instead of playing alone .
i' m telling you kathy , you got to start moving on .
i' m trying , isabel .
but i can' t .
it' s like jeremy were still here , i' m afraid i' m going to wake and find him on the couch who knows in what state .
he really put you through hell , didn' t he ?
i' m still at it .
it' s just like him .
his last selfish gesture .
leaving us right when the kids needed him most .
but they got you .
and they' re wonderful kids .
who' d want to be one of them ?
no father and a histerical mother .
you' re a great mom .
and they' re very lucky to have you .
this is a tooth of luck ... and this will help you ward off evil spirit .
we could all use one of those .

isabel , here comes a car .
i' il call you back .
mrs. macfarlane ...
your son is in the car .
don' t worry , he' s ok .
he got into a fight with a friend , but it' s not as bad as it

your mother has a right to worry about you , you know ?
the project is good .

france , my mother .
she wakes up early .
sorry about that .
that' s ok .

kathy , what' s up here ?
i lost my ring .
i guess i didn' t take your advice seriously .
oh , honey , i' m so sorry !
what a shame !
i don' t know why that keeps happening to me !
because you' re full of energy .
i wish .
most of the time i' m completely drained .

no , i don' t think so .
just a thought .
i better get back to work .

he was a pacient of my husband .

you should call an ambulance .

look .
my god , where was it ?
in the laundry .
i was positive i had lost it here .
well , it found you !
objects can travel thousands of miles if they got a reason .
it' s a sign .

no , it' s a sign that jeremy is trying to get in touch with you .
i never told you his name .
oh , yes .
human resources .
kathy , you got to listen .
i can help you get in touch with him .

my kids really like you , especially frank .

jeremy was an idealist .
he thought that medicine could change the world .
up into the moment he joined an organization abroad .

i quit the hotel , i wasn' t good for that job .
i heard you came looking for me .
tell the truth , fergus .
you' re the one who' s been calling me .
twelve fifteen precisely , every night .
that' s not some kind of joke , frightening people like that .
i was doing a friend a favour .

he asked me to contact you to tell you ...

wherever you go , i' il find you !
what the hell are you doing ?
slow down !
what' s going on ?
where is isabel ?
inside , come on , get in .
what' s going on ?
do you know the phone calls i' ve been getting at 12 : 15 am ?
it' s jeremy' s time of death , 12 : 15 !
yeah , some crank at the record' s office ...
no , isabel .
jeremy died the night i' d left him .
this kid , fergus , came back from the dead to tell me
kathy , you' re so stressed out .
he' s making the phone calls because he owes jeremy a
the dead don' t make phone calls , honey .
why don' t you let the kids stay with us for a while ?
yes , they need protection .
this isn' t the way to do .
you' re scaring the hell out of them .
he said he' d come after us no matter where we were .
honey , that' s not going to happen .
the dead don' t scare me .
just couch potatoes do that .
lte' s go make up the rooms .
i knew you' d finally come .
come on .
i can' t believe this is happening to me .
maybe i' m going crazy .
no , you' re not .
i promise you .
now i want you to try and see this from another perspective .
maybe death doesn' t really exist .
maybe it' s just a gateway to another reality .
but i' m a scientist , dora .
i only believe in things that can be proven .
try and see this exeprience ... as a blessing .
a very few people get this opportunity .
you told me ... that the bellboy said he thought he was doing jeremy a
i think that your jeremy sent fergus to talk to you ... because he wanted to talk to you himself but he couldn' t .
i think he' s in a lot of pain !
jeremy doesn' t exist .
i buried him .
he' s just dirt and worms .
we' re going to try a contact .
just goig to try .
just try .
don' t be scared .
i want you to put your hands flat down on the table ...
i want you to relax .
breath from here .
slowly ...
and in ... two ... that' s it .
relax , relax .
there you go .
one ... two ... three ... four ...
out .
two ... three ... four ...
in .
two , three , four .
i want you ... to open yourself up to jeremy .
open yourself ...
i' m sor .
no , i can' t .
jeremy needs you to forgive him , kathy .
i' m just confused , that' s all .
i shouldn' t have come in , dora .
you have got to forgive him for your own piece of mind .
you' ve got to throw out the bad stuff and focus on the good
yes , the good moments .
look for the signs , kathy .
look for the signs .
a scotch , please .
make that two .
i' m expecting someone .
i need to know what it feels like .
stop pretending you quit drinking .
where have you been ?
kathy ?
it' s marc .
happy birthday .
anybody at home ?
i came looking for the kids earlier , but ...
i brought something for them .
they' re at isabel' s house for a few days .
well ...
i' il leave them here .
is there something wrong ?
no , i don' t think so .
come on , there' s something wrong .
talk to me .
no .
why won' t you give us a chance , kathy ?
stop punishing yourself .
it' s not it .
then what ?
ok , fine .
i see him .
i hear him .
at times , i fell like i can almost touch him .
and then , there' s all these signs .
what signs ?
eights " , i see them constantly .
it' s like he' s trying to tell me something ... and i just can' t figure it out .
what' s happening to you is what grief is all about .
you miss jeremy so much that you' re attaching emotional to what your mind is showing you .
you still don' t understand .
trust me .
i' ve got to catch my plane .
contra to popular belief , the most difficult aspect of is not so much the absence of the loved one ... is a sudden interruption of communication .
trouble ?
i can' t do it anymore .
the kids and i are leaving .
i want to leave me ?
i think it' s better .
mom , what are you doing here ?
nothing .
i' m looking for marc .
is he around ?
he went to the airport .
i can' t believe you let him go .
why ?
he' s a good guy , there' s nothing wrong with him .
do you think you' re the only one who misses dad ?
that' s not fair .
then why mom ?
why not marc ?
you cant ' keep acting like this .
it' s insane .
you got to let things get better .
you' re right .
it' s going to get better .
i have to go pick up the girls at isabel' s .
i think that jeremy sent fergus to talk to you ... because he wanted to talk himself , but he couldn' t .
he asked me to contact you ...
jeremy needs you to forgive him ...
why won' t you gives a chance ?
i' m sor .
i just can' t .
why not marc ?
i can' t believe you let him go .
he ' a good guy .
it' s insane .
you got to let things get better .
alrport
passport and plane ticket , please .
thank you .
excuse me , just a moment .

you can' t keep acting like this .
i love you .
i know you can hear me now .

i' m so sor .
i just wanted to give you a chance to live ... free of that anger and violence .
i love you .
i need you to do just one more thing for me .
even the dead need to be forgiven .
i need you to
please , forgive me .
i hated you for a long time , you know that .
i can' t do it anymore .
i forgive you .
good to meet you in life , honey .

i forgive you .
the kids will be so happy to see you .
