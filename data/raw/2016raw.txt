door was ajar when we found it , headlights on .
blood on the driver' s door , speaker , more blood on top of the steering wheel ... ... around this bullet hole .
punched through the driver' s seatback , shoulder level .
okay , perp stood outside the car ... ... girl slams him with the door , perp gets a round off ... ... hits her in the shoulder , maybe the bicep .

jimmy ?
jimmy , please ...
please what ?
please ...
please what , baby ?
please what ?
that' s her .
that' s katie .
that' s my daughter .
fresh brewed .
so we need to work a time line .
it' s details , little things that make a case .
you know , things that you could forget about after a day or two .
did you ever think about how one little choice could change a whole life ?
i heard hitler' s mother wanted to abort him .
at the last minute , she changed her mind .
see what i mean ?
what do you mean , jimmy ?
what if you or i had gotten into that car instead of dave boyle ?
what car ?
you' re losing me here .
if i' d gotten into that car that day , my life would have been a different thing .
my first wife , marita , katie' s mother ... ... she was a beautiful woman .
regal .
as a lot of latin women are , and she knew it .
you had to have balls to go near her , and i did .
eighteen years old , the two of us .
she was carrying katie .
now , here' s the thing , sean .
if i' d gotten into that car , i' d be a basket case .
i never would have had the juice to go near her .
and katie never would have been born .
and she never would have been murdered .
you know ?
you ever see dave around ?
he married my cousin celeste .
what time did katie get home from work yesterday ?
around 7 : 30 .
anything unusual , out of the way about her ?
no .
she sat with us , with me and the girls , while we ate .
she was having dinner with her friends .
eve pigeon and diane cestra ?
yeah .
she talked to nadine about her communion ... ... and then she was on the phone in her room for a bit .
and then around 8 , she left .
do you know who she talked to ?
no .
do you mind if we have the phone company subpoenaed for records ?
no , go ahead .
good .
you say you spent most of the day saturday with your daughter in the store , correct ?
yes and no .
i was mostly in back .
anything odd ?
a confrontation with a customer , anything ?
no , she was herself , she was happy .
she ...
she what ?
it' s nothing .
listen , the littlest thing could be something right now .
it' s just that when she was little , right after her mother died ... ... i had just gotten out of prison , she couldn' t be by herself .
whether she was crying or not , it didn' t matter ... ... but she gave a look sometimes , like she was preparing to never see you again .
for a couple of seconds on saturday , she looked at me that way .
okay .
it was just a look .
it' s information .
we collect it , put it together , see what fits .
little things .
you were in prison ?
oh , jesus .
here we go .
whitey .
i' m just asking .
sixteen years ago , i did a two year bit for robbery at deer island .
is that gonna find my daughter' s killer ?
just asking .
let' s forget about that .
let' s get back to the point .
sorry .
it' s all right .
it' s all right .
okay , mr. markum .
okay .
okay .
all right .
so , jimmy ... ... outside of the look katie gave you , was there anything else ?
there was this kid .
what am i talking about ?
that was this morning .
what ?
remember , it' s the little things .
this kid brendan harris come in the store , like he was expecting to see her .
barely knew each other .
could they have been dating ?
no .
what makes you so sure ?
sean , are you gonna grill me ?
a father knows .
mrs. markum , was katie seeing anyone ?
no one right now , as far as we know .
i mean , knew .
i' il give you whatever you need tomorrow .
we got girls at home wanting to know where their sister is .
all right , there will be a trooper downstairs to take you home .
and if you think of anything ... ... anything at all , give us a call .
he said you almost got into a car when you were kids ?
shit .
me , jimmy and a kid named boyle were playing in front of my house .
this car came up and took dave away .
abduction ?
yeah , guys pretending to be cops .
convinced dave to get in the car , kept him for four days before he escaped .
they catch these guys ?
one died .
the other got busted , went the noose route in his cell .
your pal markum , the moment i laid eyes on him , i could tell he' d done time .
they never lose that tension , it settles in their shoulders .
he lost his daughter .
that' s what' s in his shoulders .
no , that' s in his stomach .
the tension in his shoulders , that' s prison .
the gunshot wound to the head , not the trauma from the beating .
what else ?
her and her friends were barhopping .
we' re interviewing anyone who might have seen them .
one other thing , the backpack in her car ... ... had pamphlets on las vegas and a list of vegas hotels .
it doesn' t sound like much .
what do you say , devine ?
we' il get the guy , sir .
that' s right .
all right , let' s do it .
that' s the best you can come up with ?
it made him happy , didn' t it ?
this is sean .
hello ?
is it lauren ?
you' re in manhattan .
i can tell by the traffic sounds .
is he with you ?
is that the baby ?
lauren , at least tell me her name .
yeah , nice talking to you too .
hey .
would it surprise you ?
wouldn' t be the first time .
did you see that girl ?
did you see that ... ?
did you see her ?
i heard a car hit something .
hit what ?
another car ?
oh , no , not loud like that .
like hitting the curb ?
yes , maybe .
then it stalled , and someone said , " hi .
someone said , " hi " ?
" hi .
then there was a loud crack .
could it have been a gunshot ?
yes , maybe .
did you look out your window , mrs. prior ?
oh , no .
i was in my dressing gown by then .
i don' t look out the window in my dressing gown .
the voice you heard , was that a male or a female ?
female .
i think .
it sounds like the girl knew the shooter .
yeah .
sorry to trouble you .
jimmy .
theo .
how' s my daughter ?
how' s annabeth holding up ?
she' s trying .
let' s get these on ice .
you got a couple of coolers ?
right here' s fine .
so how are you handling all this so far ?
it hasn' t really sunk in , theo .
yeah ?
it' s gonna hurt like hell when it does .
when my janey died , i was no good for six months ... ... but my kids were all grown up .
i had that luxury .
you , you got domestic responsibilities .
domestic responsibilities ?
yeah , you gotta take care of my daughter and those girls .
that' s your first priority .
oh , you figured that might have slipped my mind ?
it just needed to be said , that' s all .
you' il come through because you' re a man .
like i said to annabeth , your wedding day .
i said , " you got yourself a real old school man there .
like they put her in a bag .
what ?
that' s what katie looked like when i saw her in the morgue .
like they put her in a bag and then they beat the bag with pipes .
well ...
janey died in her sleep , all due respect .
she went to sleep , she never woke up .
peaceful .
you don' t need to talk about janey .
my daughter was murdered .
they put a gun to her .
as we stand here , she' s on an autopsy slab ... ... getting cut open by scalpels and chest spreaders ... ... and you' re talking to me about domestic fucking responsibility ?
good to see you , theo .
eve , just tell them what they want to know .
who was she dating ?
we already told the savages .
the savage brothers ?
they were here yesterday .
good , now try us out .
who was she dating ?
no one special .
you guys were having a goodbye dinner , right ?
what ?
she was leaving town , wasn' t she ?
going to las vegas ?
how do you know ?
she closed her bank account , she had hotel phone numbers .
she wanted out of this dump .
she wanted to start a new life .
well , a 19 year old girl doesn' t go to las vegas alone .
so who was she going with ?
come on , girls .
who was she going with ?
brendan .
excuse me ?
brendan .
brendan harris ?
brendan harris , yeah .
you got an address ?
hey , dave .
hey , jimmy .
sorry , i came out for a smoke .
go ahead , sit down .
sit down .
i haven' t had a chance to talk to you all day .
how you doing ?
how you doing ?
what happened to your hand ?
this ?
i was helping a buddy move a couch .
i slammed it in the doorjamb .
ways you can manage to hurt yourself , right ?
it' s good to see you .
yeah ?
how are our girls holding up ?
they' re doing okay , i guess .
that celeste , she' s a godsend .
you thank her for me , will you ?
it' s nice , isn' t it ?
just to sit out here .
yeah .
i couldn' t stand looking through the fridge to find room for all that food ... ... we' re gonna throw away in the next few days .
lot of waste , huh ?
yeah .
i just can' t let anything get fucked up in these next few days .
because it' s all anybody will remember about her .
one thing you could say about katie , even when she was little ... ... that girl was neat .
when i got out of the joint ... ... you know , after marita died ... ... i remember , i was more afraid of my little daughter ... ... than i ever was of being in prison .
i loved her ... ... most ... ... because when we were sitting in that kitchen that night ... ... it was like we were the last two people on earth .
you know , forgotten .
unwanted .
and it' s really starting to piss me off , dave , because i can' t cry for her .
my own little daughter , and i can' t even cry for her .
jimmy .
you' re crying now .
yeah , damn .
i just want to hug her one more time .
she was 19 fucking years old .
do you want me to leave you alone ?
no , just stay here for a minute , if that' s cool .
yeah , sure .
jimmy , it' s cool .
when was the last time you saw katie markum ?
you don' t think i' d hurt her do you ?
she isn' t hurt .
she' s dead .
i didn' t kill her .
again , when' s the last time you saw her ?
about 8 ...
saturday night , about 8 : 00 .
about like 8 , brendan , or at 8 ?
it was about 8 .
we had a couple slices at hi fi , and she had to go meet eve and diane .
yeah .
why doesn' t jimmy markum like you ?
i don' t know .
but he told katie he never wanted her to see me or any other harris .
what ?
that thief thinks he' s better than our family ?
he' s not a thief .
he' s a thief !
a scumbag burglar .
daughter probably had the same bad gene .
you count yourself lucky , bren .
so katie had some brochures for vegas .
we heard she was going there with you .
we were gonna leave sunday .
we were gonna get married when we got there .
well , that was the plan , right ?
you were gonna leave me ?
without a word ?
ma , i was gonna tell you .
just like your father , huh ?
that' s my brother , ray , and his friend john .
hey , boys .
hey .
he don' t speak .
father couldn' t shut up , but his son' s a mute .
oh , yeah , life' s fucking fair .
they' re here about katie .
why don' t you go watch tv or something .
so where were you between 12 : 30 and 2 a . m .
on sunday morning , brendan ?
i was asleep .
can you confirm that , mrs. harris ?
i can confirm that he closed his door at 10 : 00 .
he came down for breakfast at 9 .
i can' t confirm that he didn' t open his window and go down the fire escape .
okay , we' re gonna ask you to take a polygraph .
you think you' d be up for that ?
i loved her so much .
i' m never gonna feel that again .
it doesn' t happen twice .
doesn' t happen once most times .
celeste .
sorry , jimmy .
you surprised me .
what are you still doing here ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know , i just ...
did annabeth get to sleep ?
yeah , i convinced her to take a pill .
could i get one of those ?
yeah .
one for the road and then home .
jimmy , i can stay over if you want .
sit up with annabeth .
you' ve done enough .
to you and dave for being here for this .
okay , jimmy .
i' il be back .
i' il be by first thing tomorrow .
see you first thing .
good night .
good night .
yeah , good night .
hello ?
christ .
lauren , say something .
okay .
hey , sean , how was your day ?
oh , me ?
i' m tired of wishing things made sense .
i' m tired of caring about some dead girl , and there' s just gonna be another one after her .
sending killers to jail is sending them where they' ve been heading all their lives .
the dead are still dead .
jesus , i ... ... can' t do this tonight .
i just ...
i can' t do it .
bye , baby .
because ... ... sometimes the man wasn' t a man at all .
he was the boy .
the boy who escaped from wolves .
an animal of the dusk .
invisible .
silent .
living in a world ... ... the others never saw .
world of fireflies .
unseen except as a flare in the corner of your eye .
vanished by the time you turn your head toward it .
i just gotta get my head right .
catch a nice , long sleep .
and the boy will go back to his forest .
back to his fireflies .
is he asleep ?
how' s jimmy and everybody ?
okay .
it' s weird .
took something like this for me and him to become friends again .
dave ?
dave .
there' s still nothing in the paper .
about what ?
about what ?
i don' t know , honey .
maybe i didn' t hurt him as bad as i thought .
he' s a mugger .
he' s not going to the hospital .
yeah .
right .
anyhow , it doesn' t matter , does it ?
i mean , katie markum is dead .
that seems more important right now .
i know in my soul i contributed to your death .
but i don' t know how .
brendan harris aced his polygraph .
good .
i didn' t like him for it , nor want him for it .
yeah .
poor fucking kid .
ballistics will be back in a while .
meantime , we got a list of bar patrons .
all people who , i' m certain , are dying to cooperate .
considering the crime , maybe .
dave boyle ?
hey , is that the guy you were friends with as a kid ?
the car guy ?
could be .
he' s a guy to talk to .
he knows you .
he won' t treat us like cops .
clam up for no reason , huh ?

it' s hard to tell .
you know him .
yeah , so the reason we came by ...
listen , i saw her .
katie .
i don' t know if you know that .
at mcgill' s , the night she died .
that' s what we wanted to talk about .
they were at a couple of bars that night .
your name turned up for mcgill' s .
they put on quite a show dancing on the bar .
pretty drunk , huh ?
but it was harmless .
they weren' t stripping or nothing .
they were just 19 .
what time did they leave ?
i left at 1 .
they must' ve left 15 minutes before me .
so we' il say 12 : 45 ?
sounds about right .
you see anything unusual or anyone ... ?
michael .
like what ?
i don' t know .
a guy watching the girls ?
a guy with hate in his eyes ?
a woman hater ?
no .
no , if they hadn' t danced on the bar , it would' ve been business as usual .
see you later , dad .
you got your milk money ?
fuck , i hated school .
what ?
yeah , me too , sean .
just one more thing , mr. boyle .
where did you go after you left mcgill' s ?
home .
home by 1 : 15 , would you say ?
roughly .
sure .
all right .
yeah , well , thanks a lot , dave .
we' il grab a beer sometime ?
yeah , i' d like that , sean .
all right .
what ?
what happened to him in that car ?
