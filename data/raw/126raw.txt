did you hear that ?
they' ve shut down the main reactor .
we' il be destroyed for sure .
this is madness !
we' re doomed !
there' il be no escape for the princess this time .
what' s that ?
r2 d2 , where are you ?
at last !
where have you been ?
they' re heading in this direction .
what are we going to do ?
we' il be sent to the spice mines of kessel or smashed into who knows what !
wait a minute .
where are you going ?
the death star plans are not in the main computer .
where are those transmissions you intercepted ?
what have you done with those plans ?
we intercepted no transmissions .
aaah .... this is a consular ship .
were on a diplomatic mission .
if this is a consular ship ... were is the ambassador ?
commander , tear this ship apart until you' ve found those plans and bring me the ambassador .
i want her alive !
there she is !
set for stun !
she' il be all right .
inform lord vader we have a prisoner .
hey , you' re not permitted in there .
it' s restricted .
you' il be deactivated for sure .
don' t call me a mindless philosopher , you overweight glob of grease !
now come out before somebody sees you .
secret mission ?
what plans ?
what are you talking about ?
i' m not getting in there !
i' m going to regret this .
there goes another one .
hold your fire .
there are no life forms .
it must have been short circuited .
that' s funny , the damage doesn' t look as bad from out here .
are you sure this things safe ?
lord vader , i should have known .
only you could be so bold .
the imperial senate will not sit for this , when they hear you' ve attacked a diplomatic ...
don' t play games with me , your highness .
you weren' t on any mercy mission this time .
several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies .
i want to know what happened to the plans they sent you .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
i' m a member of the imperial senate on a diplomatic mission to alderaan ...
you' re a part of the rebel alliance ... and a traitor .
take her away !
holding her is dangerous .
if word of this gets out , it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate .
i have traced the rebel spies to her .
now she is my only link to find their secret base !
she' il die before she tells you anything .
leave that to me .
send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed ! ord vader , the battle station plans are not aboard this ship !
and no transmissions were made .
an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting , but no life forms were aboard .
she must have hidden the plans in the escape pod .
send a detachment down to retrieve them .
see to it personally , commander .
there' il be no one to stop us this time .
how did i get into this mess ?
i really don' t know how .
we seem to be made to suffer .
it' s our lot in life .
i' ve got to rest before i fall apart .
my joints are almost frozen .
what a desolate place this is .
where are you going ?
well , i' m not going that way .
it' s much too rocky .
this way is much easier .
what makes you think there are settlements over there ?
don' t get technical with me .
what mission ?
what are you talking about ?
i' ve had just about enough of you !
go that way !
you' il be malfunctioning within a day , you nearsighted scrap pile !
and don' t let me catch you following me begging for help , because you won' t get it .
no more adventures .
i' m not going that way .
that malfunctioning little twerp .
this is all his fault !
he tricked me into going this way , but he' il do no better .
wait , what' s that ?
a transport !
i' m saved !
over here !
help !
please , help !
artoo detoo !
it' s you !
it' s you !
someone was in the pod .
the tracks go off in this direction .
look , sir droids .
wake up !
wake up !
we' re doomed .
do you think they' il melt us down ?
don' t shoot !
don' t shoot !
will this never end ?
luke , tell owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks bocce .
it looks like we don' t have much of a choice but i' il remind him .
no , not that .
i suppose you are programmed for protocol .
protocol .
it' s my primary function set ...
i have no need for a protocol droid .
of course you haven' t .
not in an environment such as this .
what i really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators .
vaporators !
sir my first job was programming binary load lifter ... very similar to your vaporators .
do you speak bocce ?
of course i can , sir .
it' s like a second language for me ... i' m as fluent in bocce ...
all right shut up !
i' il take this one .
luke , take these two over to the garage , will you ?
i want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner .
but i was going into toshi station to pick up some power converters ...
you can waste time with your friends when your chores are done .
now come on , get to it !
all right , come on !
and the red one , come on .
well , come on , red , let' s go .
uncle owen ...
this r2 unit has a bad motivator .
look !
hey , what' re you trying to push on us ?
excuse me , sir , but that r2 unit is in prime condition .
a real bargain .
uncle owen !
what about that one ?
what about that one ?
we' il take that one .
i' m quite sure you' il be very pleased with that one , sir .
he really is in first class condition .
i' ve worked with him before .
okay , let' s go .
now , don' t you forget this !
why i should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity !
thank the maker !
this oil bath is going to feel so good .
i' ve got such a bad case of dust contamination , i can barely move !
it just isn' t fair .
oh , biggs is right .
i' m never gonna get out of here !
is there anything i might do to help ?
well , not unless you can alter time , speed up the harvest , or teleport me off this rock !
i don' t think so , sir .
i' m only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things .
not on this planet , anyways .
as a matter of fact , i' m not even sure which planet i' m on .
well , if there' s a bright center to the universe , you' re on the planet that it' s farthest from .
i see , sir .
uh , you can call me luke .
i see , sir luke .
just luke .
and i am see threepio , human cyborg relations , and this is my counterpart , artoo detoo .
you got a lot of carbon scoring here .
it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action .
with all we' ve been through , sometimes i' m amazed we' re in as good condition as we are , what with the rebellion and all .
you know of the rebellion against the empire ?
that' s how we came to be in your service , if you take my meaning , sir .
have you been in many battles ?
several , i think .
actually , there' s not much to tell .
i' m not much more than an interpreter , and not very good at telling stories .
well , not at making them interesting , anyways .
well , my little friend , you' ve got something jammed in here realgood .
were you on a cruiser or ...
help me , obi wan kenobi .
you' re my only hope .
what' s this ?
what is what ? ! ?
he asked you a question ...
what is that ?
help me , obi wan kenobi .
you' re my only hope .
help me , obi wan kenobi .
you' re my only hope .
oh , he says it' s nothing , sir .
merely a malfunction .
old data .
pay it no mind .
who is she ?
she' s beautiful .
i' m afraid i' m not quite sure , sir .
help me , obi wan kenobi ...
i think she was a passenger on our last voyage .
a person of some importance , sir i believe .
our captain was attached to ...
is there more to this recording ?
behave yourself , artoo .
you' re going to get us in trouble .
it' s all right , you can trust him .
he' s our new master . ... you' re my only hope .
he says he' s the property of obi wan kenobi , a resident of these parts .
and it' s a private message for him .
quite frankly , sir i don' t know what he' s talking about .
our last master was captain antilles , but with what we' ve been through , this little r2 unit has become a bit eccentric .
obi wan kenobi ?
i wonder if he means old ben kenobi ?
i beg your pardon , sir , but do you know what he' s talking about ?
well , i don' t know anyone named obi wan , but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea .
he' s kind of a strange old hermit .
i wonder who she is .
it sounds like she' s in trouble .
i' d better play back the whole thing .
he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system .
he suggests that if you remove the bolt , he might be able to play back the entire recording .
i guess you' re too small to run away on me if i take this off !
okay .
where' d she go ?
bring her back !
play back the entire message .
what message ?
the one you' re carrying inside your rusty innards !
all right , i' il be right there , aunt beru .
i' m sorry , sir , but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter .
well , see what you can do with him .
i' il be right back .
just you reconsider playing that message for him .
no , i don' t think he likes you at all .
no , i don' t like you either .
you know , i think that r2 unit we bought might have been stolen .
what makes you think that ?
well , i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him .
he says he belongs to someone called obi wan kenobi .
i thought he might have meant old ben .
do you know what he' s talking about ?
well , i wonder if he' s related to ben .
that old man' s just a crazy old man .
tomorrow i want you to take that r2 unit into anchorhead and have its memory flushed .
that' ilbe the end of it .
it belongs to us now .
but what if this obi wan comes looking for him ?
he won' t ,
i don' t think he exists any more .
he died about the same time as your father .
he knew my father ?
i told you to forget it .
your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow .
in the morning i want them on the south ridge working out those condensers .
i think those new droids are going to work out fine .
i was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season .
and if these new droids do work out , i want to transmit my application to the academy this year .
you mean the next semester before harvest ?
sure , there' re more than enough droids .
harvest is when i need you the most .
only one more season .
this year we' il make enough on the harvest so i' il be able to hire some more hands .
and then you can go to the academy next year .
you must understand i need you here , luke .
but it' s a whole ' nother year .
look , it' s only one more season .
yeah , that' s what you said when biggs and tank left .
where are you going ?
it looks like i' m going nowhere .
i have to finish cleaning those droids .
owen , he can' t stay here forever .
most of his friends have gone .
it means so much to him .
i' il make it up to him next year .
i promise .
luke' s just not a farmer , owen .
he has too much of his father in him .
that' s what i' m afraid of .
what are you doing hiding there ?
it wasn' t my fault , sir .
please don' t deactivate me .
i told him not to go , but he' s faulty , malfunctioning
that r2 unit has always been a problem .
these astro droids are getting quite out of hand .
even i can' t understand their logic at times .
how could i be so stupid ?
he' s nowhere in sight .
blast it !
pardon me , sir , but couldn' t we go after him ?
it' s too dangerous with all the sandpeople around .
we' il have to wait until morning .
luke , i' m shutting the power down for the night .
all right , i' il be there in a few minutes .
boy , am i gonna get it .
you know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble .
oh , he excels at that , sir .
have you seen luke this morning ?
he said he had some things to do before he started today , so he left early .
did he take those two new droids with him ?
i think so .
well , he' d better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there' il be hell to pay !
there' s something dead ahead on the scanner .
it looks like our r2 unit ... hit the accelerator .
hey , whoa , just where do you think you' re going ?
master luke here is your rightful owner .
we' il have no more of this obi wan kenobi jibberish ...
and don' t talk to me about your mission , either .
you' re fortunate he doesn' t blast you into a million pieces right here .
no , it' s alright .
what' s wrong with him now ?
he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast .
sandpeople !
or worst !
come on , let' s have a look .
come on .
there are two banthas down there but i don' t see any ... wait a second , they' re sandpeople all right .
i can see one of them now .
hello there !
come here my little friend .
don' t be afraid .
don' t worry , he' il be all right .
rest easy , son , you' ve had a busy day .
you' re fortunate you' re still in one piece .
ben ?
ben kenobi !
boy , am i glad to see you !
the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly .
tell me young luke , what brings you out this far ?
oh , this little droid !
i think he' s searching for his former master ...
i' ve never seen such devotion in a droid before ...
he claims to be the property of an obi wan kenobi .
is he a relative of yours ?
do you know who he' s talking about ?
now thats a name i haven' t heard in a long time ... a long time .
i think my uncle knew him .
he said he was dead .
oh , he' s not dead , not ... not yet .
do you know him ?
well of course , of course i know him .
he' s me !
i haven' t gone bythe name obi wan since oh , before you were born .
then the droid does belong to you .
don' t seem to remember ever owning a droid .
very interesting ...
i think we better get indoors .
the sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers .
where am i ?
i must have taken a bad step ...
can you stand ?
we' ve got to get out of here before the sandpeople return .
i don' t think i can make it .
you go on , master luke .
there' s no sense in you risking yourself on my account .
i' m done for .
no , you' re not .
what kind of talk is that ?
quickly , son ... they' re on the move .
no , my father didn' t fight in the wars .
he was a navigator on a spice freighter .
that' s what your uncle told you .
thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved .
you fought in the clone wars ?
yes , i was once a jedi knight the same as your father .
i wish i' d known him .
he was the best star pilot in the galaxy , and a cunning warrior .
i understand you' ve become quite a good pilot yourself .
and he was a good friend .
which reminds me ...
i have something here for you .
your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough , but your uncle wouldn' t allow it .
he feared you might follow old obi wan on some damned fool idealistic crusade like your father did .
sir , if you' il not be needing me , i' il close down for awhile .
sure , go ahead .
what is it ?
your fathers lightsaber . his is the weapon of a jedi knight .
not as clumsy or as random as a blaster .
an elegant weapon for a more civilized age .
for over a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justicein the old republic .
before the dark times , before the empire .
how did my father die ?
a young jedi named darth vader , who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil , helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights .
he betrayed and murdered your father .
now the jedi are all but extinct .
vader was seduced by the dark side of the force .
the force ?
well , the force is what gives a jedi his power .
it' s an energy field created by all living things .
it surrounds us and penetrates us .
it binds the galaxy together .
now , let' s see if we can' t figure out what you are , my little friend .
and where you come from .
i saw part of the message he was ...
i seem to have found it .
general kenobi , years ago you served my father in the clone wars .
now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire .
i regret that i am unable to present my father' s request to you in person , but my ship has fallen under attack and i' m afraid my mission to bring you to alderaan has failed .
i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this r2 unit .
my father will know how to retrieve it .
you must see this droid safely delivered to him on alderaan .
this is our most desperate hour .
help me , obi wan kenobi , you' re my only hope .
you must learn the ways of the force if you' re to come with me to alderaan .
alderaan ?
i' m not going to alderaan .
i' ve got to go home .
it' s late , i' m in for it as it is .
i need your help , luke .
she needs your help .
i' m getting too old for this sort of thing .
i can' t get involved !
i' ve got work to do !
it' s not that i like the empire .
i hate it !
but there' s nothing i can do about it right now .
it' s such a long way from here .
that' s your uncle talking .
oh , god , my uncle .
how am i ever going to explain this ?
learn about the force , luke .
look , i can take you as far as anchorhead .
you can get a transport there to mos eisley or wherever you' re going .
you must do what you feel is right , of course .
until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable .
the rebel alliance is too well equipped .
they' re more dangerous than you realize .
dangerous to your starfleet , commander , not to this battle station !
the rebellion will continue to gain a support in the imperial senate as long as ....
the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us .
i' ve just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently .
the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away .
that' s impossible !
how will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy ?
the regional governors now have direct control over their territories .
fear will keep the local systems in line .
fear of this battle station .
and what of the rebellion ?
if the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station , it is possible , however unlikely , that they might find a weakness and exploit it .
the plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands .
any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture , no matter what technical data they' ve obtained .
this station is now the ultimate power in the universe .
i suggest we use it !
don' t be too proud of this technological terror you' ve constructed .
the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force .
don' t try to frighten us with your sorcerer' s ways , lord vader .
your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes , or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebel' s hidden fort ...
i find your lack of faith disturbing .
enough of this !
vader , release him !
as you wish .
this bickering is pointless .
lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station is operational .
we will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke .
it looks like sandpeople did this , all right .
look , here are gaffi sticks , bantha tracks .
they didn' t .
but we are meant to think they did .
these tracks are side by side .
sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers .
these are the same jawas that sold us artoo and threepio .
and these blast points , too accurate for sandpeople .
only imperial stormtroopers are so precise .
why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas ?
if they traced the robots here , they may have learned who they sold them to .
and that would lead them ...
home !
wait , luke !
it' s too dangerous .
uncle owen !
aunt beru !
and , now your highness , we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base .
there' s nothing you could have done , luke , had you been there .
you' d have been killed , too , and the droids would be in the hands of the empire .
i want to come with you to alderaan .
there' s nothing here for me now .
i want to learn the ways of the force and become a jedi like my father .
mos eisley spaceport .
you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy .
we must be cautious .
how long have you had these droids ?
about three or four seasons .
they' re for sale if you want them .
let me see your identification .
you don' t need to see his identification .
we don' t need to see his identification .
these are not the droids your looking for .
these are not the droids we' re looking for .
he can go about his business .
you can go about your business .
move along .
move along .
move along .
i can' t abide these jawas .
disgusting creatures .
i can' t understand how we got by those troopers .
i thought we were dead .
the force can have a strong influence on the weak minded .
do you really think we' re going to find a pilot here that' il take us to alderaan ?
well , most of the best freighter pilots can be found here .
only watch your step .
this place can be a little rough .
i' m ready for anything .
come along , artoo .
we don' t serve their kind here !
what ?
your droids .
they' il have to wait outside .
listen , why don' t you wait out by the speeder .
we don' t want any trouble .
i heartily agree with you sir .
he doesn' t like you .
i' m sorry .
i don' t like you either on' t insult us .
you just watch yourself .
we' re wanted men .
i have the death sentence in twelve systems .
i' il be careful than .
you' il be dead .
this little one isn' t worth the effort .
come let me buy you something ...
i' m alright .
chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit our needs .
i don' t like the look of this .
han solo .
i' m captain of the millennium falcon .
chewie here tells me you' re looking for passage to the alderaan system .
yes , indeed .
if it' s a fast ship .
fast ship ?
you' ve never heard of the millennium falcon ?
should i have ?
it' s the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs !
i' ve outrun imperial starships , not the local bulk cruisers , mind you .
i' m talking about the big corellian ships now .
she' s fast enough for you , old man .
what' s the cargo ?
only passengers .
myself , the boy , two droids , and no questions asked .
what is it ?
some kind of local trouble ?
let' s just say we' d like to avoid any imperial entanglements .
well , that' s the trick , isn' t it ?
and it' s going to cost you something extra .
ten thousand , all in advance .
ten thousand ?
we could almost buy our own ship for that !
but who' s going to fly it , kid !
you ?
you bet i could .
i' m not such a bad pilot myself !
we don' t have to sit here and listen ...
we can pay you two thousand now , plus fifteen when we reach alderaan .
seventeen , huh !
okay .
you guys got yourself a ship .
we' il leave as soon as you' re ready .
docking bay ninety four .
ninety four .
looks like somebody' s beginning to take an interest in your handiwork .
all right , we' il check it out .
seventeen thousand !
those guys must really be desperate .
this could really save my neck .
get back to the ship and get her ready .
you' il have to sell your speeder .
that' s okay .
i' m never coming back to this planet again .
going somewhere , solo ?
yes , greedo .
as a matter of fact , i was just going to see your boss .
tell jabba that i' ve got his money .
it' s too late .
you should have paid him when you had the chance .
jabba' s put a price on your head , so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you .
i' m lucky i found you first .
yeah , but this time i got the money .
if you give it to me , i might forget i found you .
i don' t have it with me .
tell jabba ...
jabba' s through with you .
he has no time for smugglers who drop heir shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser .
even i get boarded sometimes .
do you think i had a choice ?
you can tell that to jabba .
he may only take your ship .
over my dead body .
that' s the idea .
i' ve been looking forward to killing you for a long time .
yes , i' il bet you have .
sorry about the mess .
her resistance to the mind probe is considerable .
it will be some time before we can extract any information from her .
the final check out is complete .
all systems are operational .
what course shall we set ?
perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion .
what do you mean ?
i think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station .
set your course for alderaan .
with pleasure .
lock the door , artoo .
all right , check that side of the street .
it' s locked .
move on to the next door .
i would much rather have gone with master luke than stay here with you .
i don' t know what all the trouble is about , but i' m sure it must be your fault ..
you watch your language !
i' il take it .
since the xp 38 came out , they' re just not in demand .
it will be enough .
come out of there solo !
right here , jabba .
i' ve been waiting for you .
have you now ?
you didn' t think i was going to run did you ?
han , my boy , there are times when you surprise me .
why haven' t you paid me ?
and why did you have to fry poor greedo like that , after all we' re been throught together ?
look jabba , next time you want to talk to me , come and see me yourself .
don' t send one of these twerps .
han , han understand , i just can' t afford to make exceptions .
you understand i just can' t make an exception .
where would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment ... ... at the first sign of an imperial starship ?
it' s not good business .
look jabba , even i get boarded sometimes .
do you think i had a choice ?
i got a nice easy charter now .
i' il pay you back ... ... plus a little extra .
i just need some more time .
han , my boy , you' re the best .
so for an extra twenty percent
fifteen jabba , don' t push it .
okay , fifteen percent .
but if you fail me again ,
i' il put a price on your head so big you won' t be able to go near a civilized system .
jabba , you' re a wonderful human being .
let' s go .
what a piece of junk .
she' il make point five beyond the speed of light .
she may notlook like much , but she' s got it where it counts , kid .
i' ve added some special modifications myself .
we' re a little rushed , so if you' il hurry aboard we' il get out of here .
hello , sir .
all right , men .
load your weapons !
stop that ship !
blast ' em !
chewie , get us out of here !
oh , my .
i' d forgotten how much i hate space travel .
it looks like an imperial cruiser .
our passengers must be hotter than i thought .
try and hold them off .
angle the deflector shield while i make the calculations for the jump to light speed .
stay sharp !
there are two more coming in ; they' re going to try to cut us off .
why don' t you outrun them ?
i thought you said this thing was fast .
watch your mouth , kid
we' il be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace .
besides , i know a few maneuvers .
we' il lose them !
here' s where the fun begins !
how long before you can make the jump to light speed ?
it' il take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi computer .
are you kidding ?
traveling through hyperspace isn' t like dusting crops , boy !
without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that' d end your trip real quick , wouldn' t it ?
what' s that flashing ?
we' re losing our deflector shield .
we' ve entered the alderaan system .
governor tarkin , i should have expected to find you holding vader' s leash .
i recognized your foul stench when i was brought on board .
charming to the last .
you don' t know how hard i found it signing the order to terminate your life !
i surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself !
princess leia , before your execution i would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational .
no star system will dare oppose the emperor now .
the more you tighten your grip , tarkin , the more star systems will slip through your fingers .
not after we demonstrate the power of this station .
in a way , you have determined the choice of the planet that' il be destroyed first .
since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base ,
i have chosen to test this station' s destructive power ... on your home planet of
alderaan .
no !
alderaan is peaceful .
we have no weapons .
you can' t possibly ...
you would prefer another target ?
a military target ?
then name the system !
i grow tired of asking this .
so it' il be the last time .
where is the rebel base ?
dantooine .
they' re on dantooine .
there .
you see lord vader , she can be reasonable . ontinue with the operation .
you may fire when ready .
what ?
you' re far too trusting .
dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration .
but don' t worry .
we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough .
commence primary ignition .
are you all right ?
what' s wrong ?
i felt a great disturbance in the force ... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced .
i fear something terrible has happened .
you' d better get on with your exercises .
well , you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs .
i told you i' d outrun ' em .
don' t everyone thank me at once .
anyway , we should be at alderaan about oh two hundred hours .
now be careful , artoo .
he made a fair move .
screaming about it won' t help you .
let him have it .
it' s not wise to upset a wookiee .
but sir , nobody worries about upsetting a droid .
that' s ' cause droids don' t pull people' s arms out of their socket when they lose .
wookiees are known to do that .
i see your point , sir .
i suggest a new strategy , artoo .
let the wookiee win .
remember , a jedi can feel the force flowing through him .
you mean it controls your actions ?
partially .
but it also obeys your commands .
hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side , kid .
you don' t believe in the force , do you ?
kid , i' ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other .
i' ve seen a lot of strange stuff , but i' ve never seen anything to make me believe there' s one all powerful force controlling everything .
there' s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny .
it' s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense .
i suggest you try it again , luke .
this time , let go your conscious self and act on instinct .
with the blast shield down , i can' t even see .
how am i supposed to fight ?
your eyes can deceive you .
don' t trust them .
stretch out with your feelings .
you see , you can do it .
i call it luck .
in my experience , there' s no such thing as luck .
look , going good against remotes is one thing .
going good against the living ?
that' s something else .
looks like we' re coming up on alderaan .
you know , i did feel something .
i could almost see the remote .
that' s good .
you have taken your first step into a larger world .
our scout ships have reached dantooine .
they found the remains of a rebel base , but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time .
they are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems .
she lied !
she lied to us !
i told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion .
terminate her ... immediately !
stand by , chewie , here we go .
cut in the sublight engines .
what the ... ?
aw , we' ve come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower .
some kind of asteroid collision .
it' s not on any of the charts .
what' s going on ?
our position is correct , except ... no , alderaan !
what do you mean ?
where is it ?
thats what i' m trying to tell you , kid .
it ain' t there .
it' s been totally blown away .
what ?
how ?
destroyed ... by the empire !
the entire starfleet couldn' t destroy the whole planet .
it' d take a thousand ships with more fire power than i' ve ...
there' s another ship coming in .
maybe they know what happened .
it' s an imperial fighter .
it followed us !
no .
it' s a short range fighter .
there aren' t any bases around here .
where did it come from ?
it sure is leaving in a big hurry .
if they identify us , we' re in big trouble .
not if i can help it .
chewie ... jam it' s transmissions .
it' d be as well to let it go .
it' s too far out of range .
not for long ...
a fighter that size couldn' t get this deep into space on its own .
it must have gotten lost , been part of a convoy or something .
well , he ain' t going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us .
look at him .
he' s headed for that small moon .
i think i can get him before he gets there ... he' s almost in range .
that' s no moon !
it' s a space station .
it' s too big to be a space station .
i have a very bad feeling about this .
turn the ship around .
yeah , i think your right .
full reverse !
chewie , lock in the auxiliary power .
chewie , lock in the auxiliary power .
why are we still moving towards it ?
we' re caught in a tractor beam !
it' s pulling us in !
but there' s gotta be something you can do !
there' s nothin ' i can do about it , kid .
i' m going to have to shut down .
but they' re not going to get me without a fight !
you can' t win .
but there are alternatives to fighting .
to you stations !
come with me .
we' ve captured a freighter entering the remains of the alderaan system .
it' s markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of mos eisley .
they must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess .
she may yet be of some use to us .
unlock one five seven and nine .
release charges .
there' s no one on board , sir .
according to the log , the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff .
it must be a decoy , sir .
several of the escape pods have been jettisoned .
did you find any droids ?
no , sir .
if there were any on board , they must also have jettisoned .
send a scanning crew on board .
i want every part of this ship checked .
i sense something ... a presence i haven' t felt since ...
get me a scanning crew in here on the double .
i want every part of this ship checked !
boy , it' s lucky you had these compartments .
i use them for smuggling .
i never thought i' d be smuggling myself in them .
this is ridiculous .
even if i could take off , i' d never get past the tractor beam .
leave that to me !
damn fool .
i knew that you were going to say that !
who' s the more foolish ... the fool or the fool who follows him ?
the ship' s all yours .
if the scanners pick up anything , report it immediately .
all right , let' s go .
hey down there , could you give us a hand with this ?
tx four one two .
why aren' t you at your post ?
tx four one two , do you copy ?
take over .
we' ve got a bad transmitter .
i' il see what i can do .
you know , between his howling and your blasting everything in sight , it' s a wonder the whole station doesn' t know we' re here .
bring them on !
i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around .
we found the computer outlet , sir .
plug in .
he should be able to interpret the entire imperial computer network .
he says he' s found the main computer to power the tractor beam that' s holding the ship here .
he' il try to make the precise location appear on the monitor .
the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations .
a power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave .
i don' t think you boys can help .
i must go alone .
whatever you say .
i' ve done more that i bargained for on this trip already .
i want to go with you .
be patient , luke .
stay and watch over the droids .
they must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as alderaan .
your destiny lies along a different path than mine .
the force will be with you ... always !
boy you said it , chewie .
where did you dig up that old fossil ?
ben is a great man .
yeah , great at getting us into trouble .
i didn' t hear you give any ideas ...
well , anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up ...
who do you think ...
what is it ?
i' m afraid i' m not quite sure , sir .
he says " i found her " , and keeps repeating , " she' s here .
well , who ... who has he found ?
princess leia .
the princess ?
she' s here ?
princess ?
what' s going on ?
where is she ?
level five .
detention block a a twenty three .
i' m afraid she' s scheduled to be terminated .
oh , no !
we' ve got to do something .
the droid belongs to her .
she' s the one in the message ..
we' ve got to help her .
now , look , don' t get any funny ideas .
the old man wants us to wait right here .
i' m not going anywhere .
they' re going to execute her .
look , a few minutes ago you said you didn' t want to just wait here to be captured .
now all you want to do is stay .
marching into the detention area is not what i had in mind .
but they' re going to kill her !
better her than me ...
she' s rich .
rich ?
yes .
rich , powerful !
listen , if you were to rescue her , the reward would be ...
what ?
well more wealth that you can imagine .
i don' t know , i can imagine quite a bit !
you' il get it !
you will ...
all right , kid .
but you' d better be right about this .
all right what' s your plan ?
uh ... threepio , hand me those binders there will you ?
okay .
now , i' m going to put these on you .
okay .
han , you put these on .
don' t worry , chewie .
i think i know what he has in mind .
master luke , sir !
pardon me for asking ... but , ah ... what should artoo and i do if we' re discovered here ?
lock the door !
and hope they don' t have blasters .
that isn' t very reassuring .
i can' t see a thing in this helmet .
this is not going to work .
why didn' t you say so before ?
i did say so before !
where are you taking this ... thing ?
prisoner transfer from block one one three eight .
i wasn' t notified .
i' il have to clear it .
he' s going to pull us all apart .
watch out !
we' ve got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in .
here it is ... cell twenty one eight seven .
you go get her .
i' il hold them here .
everything is under control .
situation normal .
what happened ?
uh ... had a slight weapons malfunction .
but , uh , everything' s perfectly all right now .
we' re fine .
we' re all fine here , now , thank you .
how are you ?
we' re sending a squad up .
uh , uh , negative .
we had a reactor leak here now .
give us a few minutes to lock it down .
large leak ... very dangerous .
who is this ?
what' s your operating number ?
boring conversation anyway .
luke !
we' re going to have company !
aren' t you a little short to be a stormtrooper ?
what ?
oh ... the uniform .
i' m luke skywalker .
i' m here to rescue you .
you' re who ?
i' m here to rescue you .
i' ve got your r2 unit .
i' m here with ben kenobi .
ben kenobi is here !
where is he ?
come on !
he is here ...
obi wan kenobi !
what makes you think so ?
a tremor in the force .
the last time i felt it was in the presence of my old master .
surely he must be dead by now .
don' t underestimate the force .
the jedi are extinct , their fire has gone out of the universe .
you , my friend , are all that' s left of their religion .
governor tarkin , we have an emergency alert in detention block a a twenty three .
the princess !
put all sections on alert !
obi wan is here .
the force is with him .
if you' re right , he must not be allowed to escape .
escape is not his plan .
i must face him alone .
get behind me !
get behind me !
can' t get out that way .
looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route .
maybe you' d like it back in your cell , your highness .
see threepio !
see threepio !
we' ve been cut off !
are there any other ways out of the cell bay ?
what was that ?
i didn' t copy !
i said , all systems have been alerted to your presence , sir .
the main entrance seems to be the only way in or out ; all other information on your level is restricted .
open up in there !
oh , no !
there isn' t any other way out .
i can' t hold them off forever !
now what ?
this is some rescue .
when you came in here , didn' t you have a plan for getting out ?
he' s the brains , sweetheart .
well , i didn' t ...
what the hell are you doing ?
somebody has to save our skins .
into the garbage chute , wise guy .
get in there you big furry oaf !
i don' t care what you smell !
get in there and don' t worry about it .
wonderful girl !
either i' m going to kill her or i' m beginning to like her .
get in there !
oh !
the garbage chute was a really wonderful idea .
what an incredible smell you' ve discovered !
let' s get out of here !
get away from there ...
no ! wait !
will you forget it ?
i already tried it .
it' s magnetically sealed !
put that thing away !
you' re going to get us all killed .
absolutely , your worship .
look , i had everything under control until you led us down here .
you know , it' s not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us .
it could be worst ...
it' s worst .
there' s something alive in here !
that' s your imagination .
something just moves past my leg !
look !
did you see that ?
what ?
luke !
luke !
luke !
luke , luke , grab a hold of this .
blast it , will you !
my gun' s jammed .
where ?
anywhere !
oh !!
luke !
luke !
grab him !
what happened ?
i don' t know , it just let go of me and disappeared ...
i' ve got a very bad feeling about this .
the walls are moving !
don' t just stand there .
try to brace it with something .
!!!!!!!
wait a minute !
threepio !
come in threepio !
threepio !
where could he be ?
take over !
look there !
they' re madmen !
they' re heading for the prison level .
if you hurry , you might catch them .
follow me !
you stand guard .
come on !
oh !
all this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here .
if you don' t mind , i' d like to take him down to maintenance .
all right .
threepio !
come in , threepio !
threepio !
get to the top !
i can' t
where could he be ?
threepio !
threepio , will you come in ?
they aren' t here !
something must have happened to them .
see if they' ve been captured .
hurry !
one thing' s for sure .
we' re all going to be a lot thinner !
get on top of it !
i' m trying !
thank goodness , they haven' t found them !
where could they be ?
use the comlink ?
i forgot i turned it off !
are you there , sir ?
threepio !
we' ve had some problems ...
will you shut up and listen to me ?
shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level , will you ?
do you copy ?
shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level .
shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level .
no .
shut them all down !
hurry !
listen to them !
they' re dying , artoo !
curse my metal body !
i wasn' t fast enough .
it' s all my fault !
my poor master !
threepio , we' re all right !
we' re all right .
you did great .
hey ... hey , open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number ... where are we ?
32 63 827 !
if we can just avoid any more female advice , we ought to be able to get out of here .
well , let' s get moving !
where are you going ?
no , wait .
they' il hear !
come here , you big coward !
listen .
i don' t know who you are , or where you came from , but from now on , you do as i tell you .
okay ?
look , your worshipfulness , let' s get one thing straight !
i take orders from one person !
me !
it' s a wonder you' re still alive .
will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way ?
no reward is worth this .
give me regular reports .
do you know what' s going on ?
maybe it' s another drill .
what was that ?
oh , it' s nothing .
don' t worry about it .
there she is .
see threepio , do you copy ?
are you safe ?
for the moment .
uh , we' re in the main hangar across from the ship .
we' re right above you .
stand by .
you came in that thing ?
you' re braver that i thought .
nice !
come on !
it' s them !
blast them !
get back to the ship !
where are you going ?
come back !
he certainly has courage .
what good will it do us if he gets himself killed ?
i think we took a wrong turn .
there' s no lock !
that oughta hold it for a while .
quick , we' ve got to get across .
find the control that extends the bridge .
oh , i think i just blasted it .
they' re coming through !
here , hold this .
here they come !
for luck !
where could they be ?
close the blast doors !
open the blast doors !
open the blast doors !
i' ve been waiting for you , obi wan .
we meet again , at last .
the circle is now complete .
when i left you , i was but the learner ; now i am the master .
only a master of evil , darth .
your powers are weak , old man .
you can' t win , darth .
if you strike me down ,
i shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine .
you should not have come back .
didn' t we just leave this party ?
what kept you ?
we ran into some old friends .
is the ship all right ?
seems okay , if we can get to it .
just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission .
look !
come on , artoo , we' re going !
now' s our chance !
go !
ben !
no !
come on !
come on !
luke , its too late !
blast the door !
kid !
run , luke !
run !
i hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission , or this is going to be a real short trip .
we' re coming up on the sentry ships .
hold ' em off !
angle the deflector shields while i charge up the main guns !
i can' t believe he' s gone .
there wasn' t anything you could have done .
come on , buddy , we' re not out of this yet !
you in , kid ?
okay , stay sharp !
here they come !
they' re coming in too fast !
we' ve lost lateral controls .
don' t worry , she' il hold together .
you hear me , baby ?
hold together !
got him !
i got him !
great kid !
don' t get cocky .
there are still two more of them out there !
that' s it !
we did it !
we did it !
help !
i think i' m melting !
this is all your fault .
are they away ?
they have just made the jump into hyperspace .
you' re sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship ?
i' m taking an awful risk , vader .
this had better work .
not a bad bit of rescuing , huh ?
you know , sometimes i even amaze myself .
that doesn' t sound too hard .
besides , they let us go .
it' s the only explanation for the ease of our escape .
easy ... you call that easy ?
their tracking us !
not this ship , sister .
at least the information in artoo is still intact .
what' s so important ?
what' s he carrying ?
the technical readouts of that battle station .
i only hope that when the data is analyzed , a weakness can be found .
it' s not over yet !
it is for me , sister !
i ain' t in this for your revolution , and i' m not in it for you , princess .
i expect to be well paid .
i' m in it for the money !
you needn' t worry about your reward .
if money is all that you love , then that' s what you' il receive !
your friend is quite a mercenary .
i wonder if he really cares about anything ... or anyone .
i care !
so ... what do you think of her , han ?
i' m trying not to , kid !
good ...
still , she' s got a lot of spirit .
do you think a princess and a guy like me ...
no !
you' re safe !
we had feared the worst .
we don' t have time for our sorrows , commander .
you must use the information in this r2 unit to plan the attack .
it is our only hope .
yes .
we are approaching the planet yavin .
the rebel base is on a moon on the far side .
we are preparing to orbit the planet .
the battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet .
it' s defenses are designed around a direct large scale assault .
a small one man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense .
pardon me for asking , sir , but what good are snub fighters going to be against that ?
well , the empire doesn' t consider a small one man fighter to be any threat , or they' d have a tighter defense .
an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station .
the approach will not be easy .
you are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point .
the target area is only two meters wide .
it' s a small thermal exhaust port , right below the main port .
the shaft leads directly to the reactor system .
a precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station .
only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction .
the shaft is ray shielded , so you' il have to use proton torpedoes .
that' s impossible , even for a computer .
it' s not impossible .
i used to bull' s eye womp rats in my t sixteen back home .
they' re not much bigger than two meters .
man your ships !
and may the force be with you !
orbiting the planet at maximum velocity .
the moon with the rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes .
this will be a day long remembered .
it has seen the end of kenobi and it will soon see the end of the rebellion .
all flight trooper , man your stations .
all flight troops , man your stations .
so ... you got your reward and you' re just leaving then ?
that' s right , yeah !
i got some old debts i' ve got to pay off with this stuff .
even if i didn' t , you don' t think i' d be fool enough to stick around here , do you ?
why don' t you come with us ?
you' re pretty good in a fight .
i could use you .
come on !
why don' t you take a look around ?
you know what' s about to happen , what they' re up against .
they could use a good pilot like you .
you' re turning your back on them .
what good' s a reward if you ain' t around to use it ?
besides , attacking that battle station ain' t my idea of courage .
it' s more like suicide .
all right .
well , take care of yourself , han .
i guess that' s what you' re best at , isn' t it ?
hey , luke ... may the force be with you !
what' re you lookin ' at ?
i know what i' m doing .
what' s wrong ?
oh , it' s han !
i don' t know , i really thought he' d change his mind .
he' s got to follow his own path .
no one can choose it for him .
i only wish ben were here .
luke !
biggs !
how are you ?
i' il be up there with you !
listen , have i got some stories to tell ...
skywalker !
are you sure you can handle this ship ?
sir , luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories .
you' il do better than all right .
thank you , sir .
i' il try .
i' ve got to get aboard .
listen , you' il tell me your stories when we come back .
all right ?
i told you i' d make it someday , biggs .
it' s going to be like old times , they' il never stop us .
this r2 unit of your seems a bit beat up .
do you want a new one ?
not on your life !
that little droid and i have been through a lot together .
you okay , artoo ?
good .
hang on tight , artoo , you' ve got to come back .
you wouldn' t want my life to get boring , would you ?
luke , the force will be with you .
stand by alert .
death star approaching .
estimated time to firing range , fifteen minutes .
all wings report in .
red ten standing by .
red seven standing by .
red three standing by .
red six standing by .
red nine standing by .
red two standing by .
red eleven standing by .
red five standing by .
lock s foils in attack position .
we' re passing through their magnetic field .
hold tight !
switch your deflectors on .
double front !
look at the size of that thing !
cut the chatter , red two .
accelerate to attack speed .
this is it , boys !
red leader , this is gold leader .
i copy , gold leader .
we' re starting for the target shaft now .
we' re in position .
heavy fire , boss !
twenty degrees .
i see it .
stay low .
this is red five .
i' m going in !
luke , pull up !
are you all right ?
i got a little cooked , but i' m okay .
we count thirty rebel ships , lord vader .
but they' re so small they' re evading our turbo lasers !
we' il have to destroy them ship to ship .
get the crews to their fighters .
watch yourself !
there' s a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower .
i' m on it .
i' m going in , cover me parkins !
i' m right with you , red 3 !
i' ve go a problem here ...
pull up no , i' m alright ...
rebel base will be in range in seven minutes .
luke , trust your feelings !
squad leaders , we' ve picked up a new group of signals .
enemy fighters coming your way .
my scope' s negative .
i don' t see anything .
keep up your visual scanning .
here the come .
watch it , you' ve got one on your tail .
i' m hit !
you' ve picked one up ... watch it !
i can' t see it !
he' s on me tight , i can' t shake him .
i' il be right there .
several fighters have broken off from the main group .
come with me !
watch your back !
fighter' s above you , coming in !
i' m hit , but not bad .
artoo , see what you can do with it .
red six can you see red five ?
there' s a heavy fire zone on this side .
red five , where are you ?
i can' t shake him !
i' m on him , luke !
biggs , where are you ?
thanks , wedge .
good shooting , wedge !
red leader this is gold leader .
we' re starting out attack run .
i copy , gold leader .
move into position .
stay in attack formation !
the exhaust post is ...
switch power to front deflector screens .
how many guns do you think , gold five .
i' d say about twenty guns .
some on the surface , some on the towers .
death star will be in range in five minutes .
switching to targeting computer .
computer' s locked .
getting a signal .
the guns ... they' ve stopped !
stabilize your read deflectors .
watch for enemy fighters .
they' ve coming in !
three marks at two ten .
i' il take them myself !
cover me !
yes , sir .
i can' t maneuver !
we' re too close .
we' re too close .
stay on target !
loosen up !
gold five to red leader ...
lost tiree , lost dutch .
i copy , gold five .
they came from behind ....
we' ve analyzed their attack , sir , and there is a danger .
should i have your ship standing by ?
evacuate ?
in our moment of triumph ?
i think you overestimate their chances !
rebel base , three minutes and closing .
red group , this is red leader .
rendezvous at mark six point one .
this is red two .
flying toward you .
red three , standing by .
red leader , this is base one .
keep half your group out of range for the next run .
copy , base one .
luke , take red two and three .
hold up here and wait for my signal to start your run .
this is it !
we should be able to see it by now .
keep your eyes open for those fighters !
there' s too much interference !
red five , can you see them from where you are ?
no sign of any ... wait !
coming in point three five .
i see them .
i' m in range .
target' s coming up !
just hold them off for a few seconds .
close up formation .
almost there !
you' d better let her loose .
i can' t hold them !
it' s away !
it' s a hit !
negative .
negative !
it didn' t go in .
it just impacted on the surface .
red leader , we' re right above you .
turn to point oh five ; we' il cover for you .
stay there i just lost my starboard engine .
get set to make your attack run .
rebel base , one minute and closing .
biggs , wedge , let' s close it up .
we' re going in full throttle .
right with you , boss .
luke , at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ?
it' il be just like beggar' s canyon back home .
we' il stay back far enough to cover you .
my scope shows the tower , but i can' t see the exhaust port !
are you sure the computer can hit it ?
watch yourself !
increase speed full throttle !
what about the tower ?
