i always wanted to be in the movies
when i was iittle i thought for sure 1 day , i could be a big big star ...
or maybe just beautiful ...
beautifui and rich , iike the women on tv
yeah , i had a iot of dreams
and i guess you can caii me a reai romaniac
because i truly believe that 1 day ... they' ii come true
so i dream about for hours
it was the year while i iearnt , i shared thing for people
they said i was dreaming
but back then , i believed that whole heartily
so whenever i was down , i was just escape into my mind
to my own iive , where i was someone else
they maybe happily think that aii these people ...
they didn' t know that who i was gonna be
but 1 day they' ii aii see
i heard that marilyn monroe was discovered in a soda shop
and i thought for sure , it could be iike that
so i started going up reai young ...
but i always secretly iooking for who is gonna discover me ?
was it this guy ?
or maybe this one ?
you never knew
they couldn' t take me aii the way iike marilyn
they would somehow believe in me just enough
they would see me for what i could be , they think i was beautifui
like a diamond in a rough
they' ii take me away ...
to my new iife
and my new world
