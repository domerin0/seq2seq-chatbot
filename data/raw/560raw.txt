since time began ... a war has been waged in the shadows ... between the armies of good and evil .
it may be fought on a grand scale ... or within the heart of a single individual ... or even a child .
the evil has taken many forms ... and used the darkest of arts .
in our time , they call themselves simply ... the hand .
the good follow the way of kimagure .
its masters can see the future ... and perhaps even bring back the dead .
legend tells of a unique warrior ... a lost soul .
this warrior is a woman ... a motherless daughter .
and it is her destiny to tip the balance between good and evil .
she is a treasure , and both sides seek her out ... as a final weapon in an ancient war .
perimeter , what' s your status ?
delta team , clear .
alpha , clear .
bravo , secure .
it doesn' t matter .
you can' t stop her .
nobody can stop her .
her ?
i was afraid if i told you , you wouldn' t take the job .
i never should' ve hired you .
who do you think' s coming for you ?
you may have heard of her .
her name ... is elektra .
you find that funny ?
she' s an urban legend , sir .
that woman died years ago .
really ?
well , then somebody must have brought her back from the dead .
you know , bauer , when you' ve done the things i' ve done ... you make a lot of enemies .
my private security detail ... the best money could buy .
this nonexistent woman killed 14 of them in half an hour .
i barely got away .
spent the next two days in monte carlo wondering why she let me go .
then she came for me .
i was under the protection of the hand itself , who sent their best .
although they seemed more interested in killing elektra than in protecting me .
she cut ' em down like wheat .
took maybe 10 , 15 minutes max .
didn' t really think why i kept gettin ' away .
so here i am .
and now i understand her .
she wanted me to feel this ... what it' s like to have nowhere to go ... nowhere to turn .
how' s your perimeter doing now ?
delta , what' s your status ?
there' s no signal .
son of a bitch .
you know , the better the assassin ...
alpha , bravo , report . !
the closer they can get to you before you know they' re there .
alpha !
bravo !
report !
ah , christ .
they say elektra whispers in your ear before she kills you .
alpha . !
bravo . !
report . !
it' s too late for your boss , bauer .
but you still have a chance .
jesus christ !
you can' t fight a ghost , bauer .
here we are at last .
guess it' s all true .
the red outfit and the knives and ...
so , what happens now ?
you just kill me , straight out ?
just cold ?
don' t worry .
death' s not that bad .
yeah ?
how do you know ?
i died once .
so am i to understand that with all the power of the hand ... that the treasure continues to elude us ?
yes .
perhaps if we had pursued it sooner ... and more aggressively ...
you dare to blame master roshi ?
seems our methods are too mild for kirigi .
not at all , sensei .
but if we cannot have the weapon ourselves ... allow me to make sure it does not fall into the hands of those who may use it against us .
master , allow me .
things like this must be handled smoothly , quietly .
then work smoothly , meizumi , but quickly .
kirigi ?
yes , father .
patience .
you think that' s safe , leaving the door unlocked like that ?
geez , elektra , you' re gonna end up with a bullet in your head .
i brought you a little something .
no , stop , mccabe .
don' t put it down .
i already cleaned there .
why do you always do this ?
get rid of my d. n. a.
ah , d. n. a. , of course .
right .
silly of me .
listen , i just picked this up .
i know you like to look .
it' s all there ?
less my 10 % .
half to barbados ?
and half to the bank on the isle of man .
you can do better in mutual funds .
i know a guy .
i could put you in touch ...
no , thanks .
or not .
but ...
look , i don' t want to tell you how to do your thing ... but quite a body count on this one , e.
we were only getting paid for demarco .
was it necessary ?
had to be done .
did it ?
elektra .
did it ?
okay .
anyway , it spreads the legend .
besides , they were gonna kill me .
of course they were .
absolutely .
and , speaking of which , as your agent ...
i am obligated to tell you we just got an absolutely fantastic new offer ...
but that last job ...
let' s skip this one .
i need a breather .
great idea .
i' m just sayin ' it' s a lot of coin .
i' m tired .
you' re tired ?
well , then you better get yourself some sleep ...
' cause you are gonna crash , baby , you know that .
i mean , you even get laid ?
it' s a lot of money , this new offer .
mccabe .
all right , fine .
you know what ?
look , you want to take time off , take time off .
call me when you wanna work .
how much ?
and just tell me .
two .
ah , they' il give it to somebody else .
they wouldn' t pay that to somebody else .
you got that right .
they asked specifically for you .
location' s in there .
i' il call you when i get the target .
get some sleep .
you might wanna reflect a bit .
again !
clear !
do you know the way , elektra ?
kimagure , the ability to control time ... the future ... even life and death .
i know i' m the best student here .
not the best .
the most powerful .
you understand violence and pain .
but you do not know the way .
teach me then .
that' s my point .
i can' t teach you .
i want you to go .
is this a test , sensei ?
no , not a test .
just go .
i don' t have anywhere to go .
the client says he needs you there a couple days early ... says that' s part of the deal .
why ?
no idea .
he just wants you to wait .
i just want to get this over with .
hey , me too .
listen , why don' t you tell me about the view ?
i hear it' s gorgeous out there .
you know , you got the ...
one , two , three , four , five .
come on , elektra .
keep pedaling .
five more minutes .
don' t use your hands .
don' t be lazy .
only use your feet .
let' s go !
let' s push , push , push , push !
nikolas .
honey , please .
she' s just a kid .
keep going , elektra .
keep going .
jesus !
what' s the matter with you ?
you could have killed me !
what are you doing here ?
nothing .
i' m friends with the wheelwrights .
damn it .
you cut my friggin ' jacket .
how did you get in ?
the front door was unlocked .
no , it wasn' t .
yeah , it was .
look , the people who live here let me come in all the time .
ask anybody .
hmm .
it' s broken .
so , who are you anyways ?
my name' s abby .
what' d you steal ?
nothing .
what do you think i am ?
ow !
please don' t call the cops .
my dad will kill me .
in some parts of the world , they just cut your hands off .
whoa .
how did you do that ?
get out of here .
mom ?
oh , shit .
you know i can' t sit still , mccabe .
call me with the name .
client says he needs you there a couple days early .
wants you to wait .
to have nowhere to go ...
death' s not that bad . nowhere to turn .
he wants you to wait .
you just kill me , straight out ?
he wants you to wait .
are you looking for me ?
hi .
are you the new , uh , tenant ?
eddie ferris , the realtor ... he said , uh , a young woman had taken it for the month .
what do you want ?
sorry .
this is kind of awkward , but , uh ... have you seen a girl ... 13 year old , uh , blondish hair to about here ?
my daughter , abby .
we had a fight yesterday ...
i saw her late afternoon .
oh , you did ?
she broke into my house .
shit .
really ?
uh , she knows the wheelwrights , who , uh ...
she , uh , didn' t take anything , did she ?
no .
good .
look , if she broke something , i' m ...
i' m happy to pay for it .
i' m mark miller .
we' re in the little cabin two houses down .
okay , thanks .
hi , you' ve reached mccabe .
but please leave just your name .
do not leave a message .
mccabe ...
i' m sick of sitting here .
we don' t get a name soon , i' m walking .
hey .
how long have you been standing there ?
like , a minute .
what did you tell my dad ?
did you tell him i broke into your house ?
yeah , because you did break in .
well , you didn' t have to tell him .
i thought you were cool .
i' m not .
yeah , no kidding .
now he' s on my case .
he made me come ask you to have christmas dinner with us .
have what ?
christmas ?
dinner ?
december 25 ?
did you know today' s christmas ?
thank you .
i can' t .
i have something to do .
what ?
everything' s closed .
you' re on an island .
come on .
please ?
it' s just the two of us every night ... and i' m bored out of my skull .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
why ?
were you counting ?
no .
so , will you come ?
please ?
because if you don' t , i' il just keep breaking into your house .
hmm ?
hmm .
i have to change my clothes .
great !
i' m abby .
elektra .
elektra .
cool . ? [ christmas ] ? [ continues ] ?
i told you not to leave the house .
you didn' t even know i was gone .
abby .
chill , dad .
we have a guest . ? [ continues ]
i' m sorry .
she told me that you' d invited me .
i don' t want to ...
i' il just ...
hmm .
uh uh .
no .
please , stay .
i' m ...
i' m glad you' re here . ? [ continues ]
uh , can i get you a beer ?
wine ?
water .
her name' s elektra , dad .
? [ continues ]
elektra .
like the tragedy .
your parents must have had a sense of humor .
not really .
so when she sees all the cute guys who like me ... just as friends , dad ... she accidentally spills poster paint all over my model of the taj mahal .
so i put glue on her shoes .
i got suspended for that , and then i got expelled for fighting .
but that was way back in the day in ... in , um ...
baltimore .
so , i was a little surprised to see you take the wheelwright place .
not many renters this time of year .
it' s just for the month , for work .
what do you do anyway ?
oh , layoffs , payroll reduction .
that sort of thing .
hmm .
sounds boring .
abby .
no , it is boring .
i like your bracelet , by the way .
do you know what those are ?
here .
they' re warrior beads .
they' re from indonesia .
centuries ago , you had to be the best fighter in your village to earn them .
wow .
i bought ' em off ebay .
is there a school here on the island ?
uh , we' re trying home schooling for a while .
i read at college level .
and i' m doing algebra one on my own .
she' s a good student .
it' s the , uh , behavioural stuff that' s been a problem .
i have authority issues , and i don' t take bullshit well .
don' t speak in that ...
hey , abby !
it' s okay .
suddenly i got a teenager on my hands .
she' s hard on herself .
you can tell , huh ?
most people think she' s a slacker .
no , i shouldn' t .
merry christmas ?
where' s her mother ?
she died ... a couple of years ago .
back in baltimore ?
yeah .
drunk driver .
my mother died when i was young .
i should go .
i have work .
come on , it' s early .
thanks for dinner .
hmm .
what ?
good morning .
you just got a delivery .
it' s a double .
which makes double the money .
yeah , that' s why the big bucks .
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
good .
then there' il be no problems .
i' il call you when it' s done .
how' s math going ?
how do you think it' s going ?
what do you mean , you' re not doing it ?
not now or not ever ?
too many variables .
not enough background .
background ?
e , they' il just send somebody else .
the storm we' ve been waiting ... all ... finally here .
it' s moved into the seattle tacoma area .
i' il get sandbags from the shed .
you know , this is such a joke .
they make it sound all exciting , but you know it' s just rain .
if you' re not too busy , young lady , feel free to tape the windows .
now !
mark . !
can i talk to you ?
can we talk inside ?
yeah , sure .
hey , what' s up ?
can you go to your bedroom for a minute , abby ?
i need to talk to your dad .
now !
go , abby .
who are you ?
don' t lie to me .
what ?
they won t just kill you .
they' il kill abby .
damn it . !
dad !
go !
run , abby !
bathroom !
go !
go !
go !
stay with abby !
okay .
elektra !
abby !
no !
ohh !
damn it .
get back !
get back !
go !
go .
there' il be more coming .
what' s coming next will be worse .
i believe kirigi wishes to address the council of the hand .
venerable master ... despite your delicacy and subtlety ... you have failed to solve the problem of the treasure .
huh !
master roshi gave that task to me .
yes , exactly .
and my men are taking care of it .
your men are dead !
killed by the female , elektra , the gaijin .
bu ...
your forces are an abomination !
master roshi ... the hand cannot afford to lose the treasure for another generation .
so i humbly request you allow me this task .
perhaps with a little less delicacy ... my forces will not be defeated by a mere woman .
the task is yours .
complete it , and you will have proven yourself worthy of leading this council .
i will step aside .
oh , that' s just great .
the hand .
of all people .
so who' s gonna help you out on this one , e ?
stick ?
just give me his location .
sure , no problem .
i got it handled .
goddamn it .
? [ slow rock ]
you' re up , blind man .
triple carom on the four three two one six with a bank mass .
uh , you don' t need to call all your shots , pops .
just the first one .
that is the first one .
whoa , whoa .
aw , you gotta be kidding me .
eight ball in the corner .
blind , my ass .
leave your money on the table .
here' s a dollar , abs .
go play some pinball .
why do i always have to miss the good stuff ?
just go .
elektra .
same walk .
same perfume .
they need your help .
over here .
this is mark miller .
mark and his daughter , abby , are being chased by the hand ... and they need your protection .
i' m leaving them with you .
the hand is your business , not mine .
and yet you saved their lives .
why ?
what did you imagine would happen next ?
i didn' t really have time to think about it .
blind instinct .
then you and i are back where we started , elektra .
did you ever ask why the hand was after them ?
they don' t know .
really ?
mr. miller doesn' t know ?
i do know .
the hand wanted something he couldn' t give .
he tried to run .
and what ?
they killed my wife , abby' s mom .
there was no drunk driver .
i lied .
you' re on your own .
why did you really save them , elektra ?
some kind of penance ?
a down payment on your sins ?
has she told you what she actually does for a living , mr. miller ?
she saved my life and my daughter' s .
that' s enough for me .
then you landed on the lucky side of the street .
damn , you son of a bitch !
because with most people ...
well , elektra ... you haven' t changed .
what are we gonna do ?
elektra ?
what are we gonna do ?
you gotta run .
as far as you can , as fast as you can .
south america .
africa .
change your name .
change your appearance .
you' re not coming with us ?
no .
i can' t .
why not ?
isn' t that part of your code or something ?
i don' t have a code , abby .
how are we supposed to defend ourselves ?
we' il be okay , abby .
no , we won' t .
wake up , dad .
we won' t . !
they' re gonna hunt us down .
just like mom .
get in the car .
get in the car !
what' s wrong ?
she' s down the street .
three blocks over in the parking lot .
we need to kill the gaijin assassin first .
should we go now ?
not here .
keep track of them .
country ]
i' m a soccer mom .
so , you , um ... you really kill people for a living ?
yeah .
why ?
it' s what i' m good at .
that' s messed up .
yeah .
well , well , the reluctant assassin .
sorry to drag you into this , mccabe .
me too .
hi .
i' m abby .
hello , abby .
i' m wondering what you' re doing here .
there' s plenty of room in the house .
go ahead and help yourselves to whatever you need .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
you want to pull the trigger , or should i do it ?
oh , e.
you' re crashin ' on me , baby .
i said you' d crash , and you are crashing .
i just want to get ' em someplace safe , give ' em a chance .
they' re already dead , e.
they got no chance .
don' t go down with them .
i' il need passports .
i' il need plane tickets .
sure .
throw in some season tickets to the lakers .
go .
i don' t want you to tell her anything .
i hate lying .
why can' t we tell her ?
we don' t know anything about her .
she saved us .
because she doesn' t really know who you are .
if she knew ...
she' s my friend .
your friend ?
she' s the only one i have .
and i do not want to die with ...
you' re not gonna die !
don' t you ever say that again ... ever .
okay ?
yes .
elektra ?
what' s the matter ?
is something wrong ?
they told me to change my appearance , so ...
no , it' s ...
you look great .
thanks .
can you show me how to use those things , the , uh , salad tongs ?
sais .
sais .
they' re not for you .
i want to learn how to defend myself .
they' re offensive weapons .
they' re for killing .
you use them .
i don' t want you to be like me .
i do .
do you wanna learn something really , really difficult ?
yeah .
what ?
come on .
now sit down .
close your eyes .
what is this , yoga ?
no , it' s called kimagure .
kimagure .
it' s more valuable than learning to use a weapon ... because it allows you to see what' s gonna happen before it happens .
that' s intense .
how do you do it ?
concentrate .
meditate .
let go of yourself and see everything around you .
it' s not easy .
how long did it take you to master ?
i never actually finished my training .
i only know enough to keep myself alive .
but there are true masters like stick who can use kimagure to bring back the dead .
wow .
close your eyes and breathe .
just sit quietly .
shh !
how are you doing ?
we' re still alive .
thank you .
oh , don' t thank me , mark .
please , you don' t really know what i was doing .
what you were doing there ?
sure i do .
you were there to kill us .
i knew it as soon as you took the wheelwright place .
i' m not a good person to get involved with .
i' m not asking for anything .
i' m sorry .
yeah , i hated that .
e , get back .
get back now . !
what happened ?
that bird' s been hanging around here since late yesterday .
they' re here .
they' re here .
let' s use the truck .
we won' t make it .
but that' s the best way .
trust me .
there isn' t time .
use the cellar .
there' s a tunnel .
take you out past the orchard to the trees .
head north .
what about you ?
shit .
let' s go .
be careful .
keep ' em safe .
holy ...
don' t tell me , the circus is in town , huh ?
i' il tell you what .
you might as well kill me now , ' cause i ain' t talking .
talking is not necessary .
but i accept the first half of your proposal .
they' re in the woods .
typhoid , stone , tattoo .
get kinkou , head there now .
hurry .
hold up .
just follow me .
just keep running .
get in there .
mark , come on .
go .
go .
elektra .
elektra !
shh .
go !
run , abby !
run !
go !
why didn' t you tell me ?
elektra . !
abby , no !
let me go !
ah , you are the little treasure , aren' t you ?
the war is over .
the war has just begun .
move back , abby .
she is safe .
another day , old man .
you' il be fine .
rest now .
don' t look for your opponent .
know where he is .
i' m blind , and i see more than any of you , because i don' t look .
you had no right to drag me into this , stick .
this whole war with the hand , everything , it' s all about her , isn' t it ?
they call her the treasure .
she was a prodigy from four or five years old .
word got around fast .
the hand wanted her for themselves .
they tried to steal her .
her father spirited her away .
and you set this up ... the contract , mccabe , all of this ... you hired me to kill them .
you' re entitled to your opinion .
a father and his daughter , stick .
you manipulated me .
did i ?
was all this a test ?
everything from the day you threw me out , has it all been a test ?
what if i had failed ?
some lessons can' t be taught , elektra .
they must be lived to be understood .
when you came here , you were filled with anger .
all the decency you once had , poisoned by violence and tragedy .
this is not the way .
this is not our way .
you talk in riddles , old man .
it keeps my students alert .
i always knew your heart was pure .
you simply needed to see it for yourself .
what about abby ?
as long as kirigi is alive , she' s only safe here .
she has no choice .
two , three , four , five .
one , two , three , four .
two , three , four .
one ...
still breaking and entering i see .
sorry .
you' il need it .
keep practicing .
i' m sorry i lied to you .
don' t apologize .
you did what you needed to do .
i didn' t wanna lie to you .
neither did my dad .
it made me sick not telling you .
everybody lies , abby .
nobody tells the truth about themselves .
including you .
especially me .
the layoffs and payroll reductions .
like that .
and the , uh , the counting .
sorry ?
o. c. d.
i don' t have o. c. d.
i had it when i was a kid , but i haven' t done that in years .
you were just doing it .
when you walk slow like that .
what are you doing ?
are you counting ?
don' t mock me .
i' m still your superior .
maybe .
wanna find out ?
i' m gonna go find my dad .
don' t force it .
you' re forcing it .
you' il be better than i am very soon .
i' m just a kid .
i don' t wanna stay here .
what do you want ?
to finish it , you and me .
no help from stick , no help from your father .
winner take all .
and when i kill you , the little one is ours .
and when you don' t , she is free forever .
agreed ?
agreed .
we will meet where it all began .
and it will end where it all began .
for you , at least .
clever girl .
we meet again .
now you' il remember .
there' s nothing you can do .
so the balance tips to me .
let her go . !
brave girl .
you taught her well .
but it' s time for a new master .
is that what the blind man' s been teaching you ?
not good enough .
but you' il learn to anticipate your opponent .
abby ...
i' m not leaving you .
you' re a pain in the ass .
just like you .
one , two , three .
tattoo , the treasure' s here .
stay right behind me .
stay close , abby .
elektra !
nice trick .
i' ve seen it before .
abby , where are you ?
elektra ?
not exactly .
you know , i used to be the treasure ... and i don' t like being replaced .
so let' s keep your death between you and me .
abby !
enough .
it ends now .
i told you , there' s nothing you can do .
you' re slipping , elektra .
come on , let' s go .
push , push , push .
let' s go .
let' s push , push , push , push . !
keep going , elektra .
keep going .
i' m just a kid .
i don' t wanna stay here .
elektra .
don' t worry , elektra .
i' il take good care of her .
abby .
damn it .
come on .
abby .
abby , listen to me .
listen to me .
i always knew your heart was pure .
you simply needed to see it for yourself .
hey , warrior girl .
come here .
come here , abby .
i just found you .
hi .
thank you .
take good care of her .
sorry .
yeah , i hated that .
so , what' s next ?
kirigi' s gone .
no one' s after you .
back to school ?
go to the beach and get a tan .
and get ice cream .
oh .
you gave me my life back .
you gave me mine .
will i see you again ?
we' il find each other .
please don' t let her be like me .
why not ?
you didn' t turn out so bad .
i don' t want it to be so hard for her .
that' s up to her .
anyway , your second life' s never really like your first , is it ?
sometimes ... it' s even better .
