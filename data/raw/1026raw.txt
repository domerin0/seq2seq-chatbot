there' s been a train crash outside santa barbara .
they' re flying an aortal trauma here now .
how can i ask you this , david ?
i can do it , blake .
is he crazy , jasmine ?
he' s been on his feet for 14 hours .
chloe , it' s been this way since leslie died .
losing himself in his work , poor thing .
this is getting a little reckless , don' t you think ?
i don' t think he has a choice .
hang on a second , jasmine !
it' s not like he has to do it .
well , who else at loma vista can do it ?
who else can do what david can do ?
try lonnie walsh .
and he wouldn' t expect to be knighted for it .
blake , i can handle that transplant .
we need somebody with the right kind of experience , lonnie .
even if he' s falling asleep on his feet ?
it' s a complicated procedure , lonnie .
why don' t you observe ?
hey , i' m not fresh out of medical school !
excuse me , miss ?
no , you' re not , lonnie .
you' re a good doctor .
but you' re not david ravell .
miss ?
miss ?
you will march into mr daniels ' office ... ... and tell him that he will be held personally responsible ... ... should anything go wrong during this operation .
mother ...
moreover , you are going to tell him ... ... that in your observation ...
did you see that ? ... dr david ravell is not up to his usual olympian heights of surgical skill .
he complained of dizziness , that sort of thing .
do you understand ?
do you want to hear what i have in mind for the famous dr david ravell ?
a reason to love will continue after these messages .

you got a fine one right here !
your wife is very attractive , del .
have i seen her before ?
if you ate at the tip top , you did .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
the coffee .
yeah , betty pours a mean cup .
sit in here .
chloe when skipper died , it hurt so bad .
i just wanted the world to go away .
to a successful transaction .
we are where we' re supposed to be .
and if you feel ... ... something ... for someone ... ... you should ...
no ... passionate kisses
oh !
please !
it' s not that i don' t find you attractive .
i' m just not ready .
no , he' s not ready .
nice place you got here , del .
real comfortable .
sweet little town , fair oaks .
you like it ?
what , are you kiddin ' me ?
it' s a small town , man .
what do you mean , del ?
just a bunch of dumb fucks .
really ?
you better believe it .
could you give us an example ?
of what ?
i' m asking for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck .
i don' t follow .
you' re not a dumb fuck , are you , del ?
no .
so , give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing .
not being stupid yourself , you' re equipped to know .
right ?
are we gonna get down to business here or not ?
just give me one example .
one .
ok .
ok .
burger king opens up .
these assholes get excited and line up like they' ve never seen one before .
like it' s some kind of five star restaurant .
five stars .
yeah .
how about it , wesley ?
that sound stupid to you ?
no , that' s ignorant .
they just don' t know any better .
so , del , maybe you could give us another example .
this is bullshit !
can we get down to business , please ?
jesus christ !
he' s waiting .
ok , ok , ok !
i don' t know , injuns are stupid .
injuns ?
del , did you just say " injuns " ?
indians .
injuns , whatever .
i mean , they' re always getting drunk and doin ' stupid shit .
like what ?
pukin ' on the sidewalk .
stupid shit .
well , let' s see .
round here , that would be kiowa , kickapoo and osage .
am i right about that ?
i ...
i don' t know .
you don' t know .
del ... ... my idea of stupid' s different from yours .
so here' s how this is gonna work .
take your socks off .
sobs oh , hey , come on .
i' m sorry .
it' s my fault .
i thought that you felt something for me .
chloe , you' re wonderful .
you are .
i just know that there' s something really special out there for me .
i don' t know what it is , or who it is .
i just know that since leslie died , i' ve had this feeling ...
del , wanna know what stupid is ?
stupid is taking what doesn' t belong to you .
isn' t that right , wesley ?
that' s right .
stupid is trying to sell it to people who are , by their very nature , untrustworthy .
that is so right .
stupid is calling people in kansas city ... ... who are affiliated to the rightful owners of the thing you stole ... ... and trying to sell it to them .
now , that' s really stupid .
you know , del ... ... 150 years ago , your remark about native americans would' ve gotten you scalped .
right here where your house is , you' d have been scalped .
hell of a way to die .
now , wesley , it wasn' t always fatal .
we could scalp old del right now .
he' d be plenty alive to tell us what it feels like .
all you have to do is take a knife ...
del , come on , now , we' re just talking .
come on .
you just take a knife , and you make a mark across the front of the forehead .
grab ' em a handful of hair , and cut as you pull .
it' s amazing how easily the scalp comes off .
a mark , huh ?
it' s ok , david .
shh !
i mean , what do i know ?
a woman gets in your car , you take her for a ride in the woods ...
wait a minute .
this was your idea .
who' s driving the car , david ?
what ?
does it really matter who said what ?
of course it matters !
now , i want to know the particulars of your wrongdoing .
i want to know how you got what you stole ... ... and , of course , where it is now .
it' s in the buick .
but i swear to god i didn' t touch it .
i swear to god !
all right , then .
don' t kill me !
i don' t want you to kill me ...
don' t kill me ...
consider yourself lucky , del .
luckier than those " injuns " you' ve got such contempt for .
if anybody got a raw deal , it was the american indian .
america has a black mark on its soul for what happened to them .
i' m glad they' ve got those casinos .
david ...
i wish i had good news for you .
i' il come right to the point .
chloe jensen has filed charges of sexual assault against you .
fucking christ , wesley !
are you out of your fucking mind ?
what the fuck is wrong with you ?
what the fuck is your problem ?
you told me to do it !
that was to get him to talk , you ...
get rid of that fuckin ' thing !
get rid of it !
then i can forget .
ever feel like something really special is about to happen to you , jasmine ?
fucking great , wesley !
now we don' t know where the stuff is !
well , he said it' s in the buick !
which fuckin ' buick ?
then , why' d you shoot him ?
i had to shoot him , wesley !
it was the only decent thing to do , after you scalped him !
echoing i just know that there' s something really special out there for me .
very unprofessional , wesley !
echoing i don' t know what it is or ... who it is .
i just know that since leslie died , i' ve had this ... feeling .
i just know that there' s something really special out there for me .
i don' t know what it is , i just know that since leslie died , i' ve had this ... ... feeling .
betty !
betty !
can we use this ?
yeah , hand me that bag .
hey , betty .
hi !
are you ok ?
i' m great .
i was wondering if i might be able to ask some questions about what happened .
well , i saw the whole thing .
it was disgusting .
really ?
did you see who did it ?
mm hm .
you did ?
who was it ?
it was chloe .
you guys wanna try not stepping directly in the evidence , please ?
roy ostrey !
you and your goddamn police scanner !
i leave here for ten minutes ...
betty , i' m sorry about this .
oh , it' s no problem .
well , bye , everybody .
nice to see you , sheriff .
thanks for stopping by !
where the hell' s she goin ' ?
i still don' t understand how you knew del wasn' t lying .
i saw his soul , wesley .
the man was face to face with his god .
nobody lies in that situation .
your little geronimo act rattled me , and i abandoned my instincts .
never abandon your instincts .
i didn' t !
you gave me a look !
what fuckin ' look ?
you only got one .
you give me this look , i thought you were done , so i offed him .
i wasn' t done , i was just tired of hearing him whine .
and you didn' t off anybody , you scalped him .
jesus , i almost puked , did i tell you that ?
so why tell me the fuckin ' indian story ?
what the hell does that mean , wesley ?
if i' d told a ty cobb story , would you have beaten him to death with a baseball bat ?
you ...
goddamn !
nothin ' there .
let' s go .
you wanna just leave the cars like this ?
why not ?
it' il confuse ' em .
gotta do something now you' ve fucked it up .
i didn' t fuck nothin ' up !
i was just trying to make a statement .
trying to make a statement
let me tell you something ... ... in this business , you don' t put food on the table unless the phone rings .
the people who get the calls are good .
not flashy , good .
they get in , they get out , nobody knows a goddamn thing .
you understand ?
boom , boom , boom .
three in the head , you know they' re dead .
that' s a good motto .
well , i' il get you a bumper sticker .
you better start believing it .
it' s the only statement you need to make .
is this bothering you ?
let' s get this thing down .
thank you .
listen .
i questioned joyce about all this .
yeah ?
seems she was pretty familiar with old del on a regular basis , if you get my drift .
and half the other guys in this town , including yourself , i believe .
junior year .
anyway , so what ?
suppose betty found out about them ?
so you' re saying that betty sizemore , our betty sizemore ... ... who you went to swing choir with ... ... hired somebody to scalp her husband in her kitchen while she watched ?
it' s just a theory .
oh , you' re amazing !
just because i' m thinkin ' it doesn' t mean i like it .
so ?
how is she ?
she' s in a kind of shock .
i see signs of a post traumatic reaction , with possible dissociative symptoms .
could i have that in american ?
it' s a kind of altered state .
it allows a traumatised person to continue functioning .
so she did witness it ?
without question .
but her memory of it has gone .
any idea who chloe or lonnie are ?
night .
sue ann , i gotta tell you something .
a bad thing happened to del and me .
yeah , hon .
why don' t you get some sleep ?
everything' s gonna be fine .
oh , i know .
and i' m real sorry about all this .
but i just know there' s something special out there for me .
dear del ... ... this is the hardest thing i' ve ever done , but i need to be honest .
admit it , del .
we' ve grown apart and you don' t seem happy any more .
as for me , i don' t think i' ve ever given myself a chance .
but i want to take that chance now .
best of luck to you ... ... betty .
this is bad , wesley .
this is very , very bad .
this is extremely bad .
mm hm ?
want some bacon ?
i don' t think you appreciate the gravity of the situation here .
it' s bad enough that we don' t have what we came for .
we don' t even know where the hell it is .
now this .
this is s' posed to be my last job .
i mean , i even put down a deposit on my boat .
how the hell can you eat at a time like this ?
i get nauseous just watching you .
well , i can eat cos i know we didn' t kidnap no woman .
and i can eat cos i know ain' t nobody lookin ' for us .
and i can eat cos i' m fuckin ' hungry .
relax .
she' il end up on a milk carton or somethin ' .
that' s about it .
she got out of town awful quick .
and wasn' t she quiet in that house ?
mm hm .
i think most women would have screamed , don' t you ?
i know they would have .
yeah .
we could be dealing with a cunning , ruthless woman here .
uh , mrs rogers ?
yes .
how you doin ' ?
dwight campbell , mutual life insurance .
i' m looking for a betty sizemore .
i wish i could help you , but i can' t .
go to your room .
now .
precious , ain' t they ?
y' know , she has a substantial death benefit coming to her ... ... from the tragic loss of her husband .
does she have any relatives in the area ?
no .
well , she does have some grandparents down in oklahoma , but that' s it .
so are you in touch with mrs sizemore ?
no .
but i am taping her show for her .
her show ?
yeah , a reason to love .
did chloe testify ?
and she' s been working here how long ?
oh , five years , give or take .
you two in high school together ?
aren' t you a sweetheart ?
no .
not quite .
she' s been with us quite a while .
but she wanted more out of life , huh ?
no , she just wanted something out of life .
anything .
who' s this gentleman ?
it' s just a cutout .
a gag for her birthday .
do you mind if i keep these ?
if it' il help bring her back , be my guest .
i hope you didn' t get the wrong idea on the phone , lonnie .
oh , i don' t think so , chloe .
lonnie when they call you to the stand , just say what you' re supposed to say .
you mean i' m going to have to swear ?
on a bible ?
relax , it' s a hearing .
but they are going to ask you some questions .
oh , no !
so , you' re into reason , too ?
is ...
david going to be there ?
i' m ellen .
what can i get you ?
um , a lite beer , please .
come on , chloe .
you' re a beautiful , intelligent , sexy woman ...
thank you . ... with a torn blouse !
you can' t lose .
a reason to love will continue after these messages .
ellen , do you have a phone ?
here you go .
if it' s long distance , you can leave me a buck when you' re done .
thanks .
3 . 99 for kids !
you know you want ...
hello ?
sue ann ?
betty !
hi , just calling to tell you that i' m fine .
ok , where are you ?
i' m in the ... ... canyon ranch bar .
in , um ...
williams .
in williams , arizona .
so i guess i' m halfway there .
halfway to where ?
you' ve gotta come home !
we' ve been really worried about you , y' know .
sue ann , i thought you' d back me on this .
you know how it is with del .
how did he take my note ?
listen to me .
a nice man came by from mutual life insurance .
he says you' ve got a lot of money coming to you from del' s policy .
what are you talking about ?
del' s life insurance policy .
are you with me ?
oh , i' ve gotta go .
no , betty , listen to me .
del is dead !
what did i ever do to her ?
it' s what you didn' t do , bud .
orchestra swells
so where you headed , betty ?
los angeles , california .
and you called your friend and she' s telling you not to go ?
when i went to europe , my friends told me i was crazy .
europe ?
the europe ?
god , this is my first time out of kansas !
i should call you dorothy .
when i first left here , i went straight to italy .
everyone told me not to go , but , oh , i wanted to go to rome !
ever since i saw audrey hepburn in roman holiday .
goddammit , i went !
did you love it ?
rome , it was the best thing i ever did .
because i did it !
and i swear to you , it changed me .
i' ve been to rome , italy .
i sat every morning in the caffe sistina , and i drank my cappuccino and i ... ... i watched the pilgrims walk to mass .
no one can ever take that away from me .
i left my husband three days ago .
really ?
yeah .
i' m getting back with my ex fianc .
he proposed to me right around here , so i guess this is a sentimental stop .
pink martini .
whatever will be , will be ue ser , ser
when i was just a little girl
i asked my mother " what will i be ?
will i be pretty ?
will i be rich ?
here' s what she said to me .
que sera , sera
whatever will be ...
isn' t this your first time out of kansas ?
well , i mean , except for then .
i' m trading in a car dealer for a heart surgeon , so that' s not too bad , huh ?
that' s smooth !
cedars sinai ?
no , no , no .
loma vista .
i suppose his name is david ravell ?
how did you know that ?
what' s his real name ?
it' s doctor david ravell .
but how did you know ?
do you mean george mccord , the actor ?
no .
no , no , no .
david ravell .
he' s a heart specialist .
i know , we just watched him ...
you' re serious ?
how are you gonna find him , betty ?
well , i' il ...
i' il go to the hospital .
what if when you get there , nothing' s like you thought it was gonna be ?
well , this is the biggest thing that i' ve ever done .
and i have to do it .
you take care of yourself , betty .
to tell you the truth , i can' t believe i' ve made it this far .
betty is a big fan of the soap opera a reason to love .
look , that' s important .
why do i need to look at it ?
he told you to do this ?
no !
i saw , on television , chloe and lonnie .
they' re television characters !
and betty is in love with dr david ravell , from the show .
what if she' s in los angeles looking for him ?
the actor , i mean .
that' s the dumbest thing i' ve ever heard .
dumb ?
then why did betty call sue ann from arizona yesterday ?
yeah , she called me yesterday !
said she was in arizona , did she ?
yes !
this is even stupider than i thought .
this woman is on the run ...
come on , elden ! ... you think she' d phone in her location ?
why not call the los angeles police ?
you have got to do that !
hey !
i' m the law .
i ain' t gotta do nothin ' .
that' s betty when she was 12 .
very graceful .
perfect form .
yeah .
such poise , too .
very impressive .
thank you , ma' am .
did she ever give you any indication that she might leave her husband ?
she put up with things that i wouldn' t have .
and yet , she , of all people , defended him .
that' s why what that sheriff said made me angry .
what do you mean ?
if anyone paid to have that husband of hers killed , it would have been me .
well , mr and mrs blaine ... ... i can assure you without a doubt that your granddaughter' s alive .
and she had absolutely nothing to do with the killing of del sizemore .
you' ve got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone .
that' s not our betty .
why you say you gotta be missin ' a piece of your soul to kill somebody ?
well , because it' s not natural , young man .
it' s very , very natural to kill .
all species kill .
see , god kills .
you sayin ' that god' s missin ' a piece of his soul ?
my partner' s young , mr blaine .
he loves his job .
loves his job .
matter of fact , he' d like to kill all the criminals himself .
let me just ask you this .
if betty was running from someone , where do you think she' d go ?
a reason to love theme
chief nurse of course , i don' t know every doctor that works here .
but dr ravell is the finest surgeon on the staff .
you must know him .
he' s really handsome , and he' s gentle , and considerate .
he' s being sued for sexual assault .
what ?
well , he didn' t do it .
he was set up .
well , i certainly would have heard about that .
of course , he' s only here twice a week .
he' s also on staff over at loma vista .
i don' t think i know that hospital .
oh , it' s the one in the really pretty area ... ... with the palm trees out front and the mountains in the back .
you' ve just described all of southern california .
i' m sorry , but i can' t even consider you without references and a rsum .
and frankly , i don' t know how you could have forgotten them .
central , reply to 3359 , please .
reply to 3359 .
oh ...
oh ...
hi .

oh , i think he has the ...
he has the thingy !
what does he have ?
the ... the air in the wound !
he has too much air around the heart and the lungs ... ... so i have to open ...
i have to ...
i have to relieve the pressure so he can breathe .
ok , here we go .
what are you doing ?
you' il hurt him !
no , i have to do this , or he' il die !
it' s ok , i' ve seen it done once .
here we go .
ready ?
see ?
wasn' t so bad .
is he gonna be all right ?
we' il do everything we can for him .
you should thank that nurse for what she did .
iris , who was that remarkable nurse ?
what you did yesterday was reckless at best .
you are not an employee of this hospital .
if that boy dies , i don' t even want to think about the lawsuit that will follow .
are we communicating here ?
yes , ma' am .
good .
because i' m prepared to offer you a job .
you can help out in the pharmacy ... ... until your california certification and references arrive ... . but you are not to touch anyone .
is that totally clear ?
well , he' s doing fine !
ay , gracias a dios .
you don' t sound like you' re from here .
no , i' m from kansas .
i just drove in .
oh .
why did you come to la ?
i came for love .
my ex fianc lives here , so ...
ay , qu bien !
so , are you staying with him ?
oh , no .
i don' t actually know where he is just yet ... ... so i' m at a motel around the corner .
rosa , ella debe quedarse contigo .
s !
no tiene donde vivir .
this neighbourhood .
you get used to it .
oh !
pretty .
yeah , i got this apartment with a guy .
oh , the guy you were telling me about ?
oh , no .
this one was worse .
i had to have the place sprayed when he left .
twice .
he was ... two before the last one , not counting a little office thing in there ... ... which i' m trusting you with because if it gets out ... ... i' m on the street , know what i' m sayin ' ?
oh !
oh , wow !
this is nice !
oh , i love the aquarium .
yeah , well , at least fish don' t pee on the seat .
just once , i wish i' d run into a guy who would notice them before my tits !
come on , i will show you to your room .
ok .
no , no , no !
we' il ... we' il find her .
yes .
i understand .
so what did they say ?
they said find it .
find her .
finish the job we were paid to do .
half .
what ?
well , they only paid us half , so they still owe us the other half .
oh , goddamn , wesley .
there you go again !
the same lousy assed attitude that got us here in the first place !
that " make a statement ... ... do an end zone dance , shake your ass and sue everybody in sight " attitude ... ... that' s draggin ' this whole fuckin ' country down the drain !
you get paid when a job is done !
and we haven' t done the goddamn job !
i know that .
turn off that goddamn music !
do i deserve this ?
in the twilight of my career , do i deserve this ?
i don' t think so .
i never took out anybody that didn' t have it coming .
i' m a fuckin ' professional !
and where am i ?
purgatory !
worse .
you' re in texas .
i am very tired .
i' ve worked hard , and my work should be over .
but it' s not .
this fuckin ' job is just beginning .
betty , betty , betty .
what' s goin ' through that pretty little head of yours ?
everyone says if you wanna get married ... ... this is the spot to find someone .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
luckily for me , i' m off men , so i have the luxury of not giving a shit .
y' know , the more i think about it , david probably wouldn' t come here .
i mean , he' s still getting over leslie and everything .
who is leslie ?
his wife .
he has a wife ?
had .
she died in a car wreck last year .
decapitated .
god , that' s awful .
i know .
they' re not even sure it was an accident cos they never found her head .
her head ?
mm hm .
you are making this up .
oh , no , no .
she was having an affair with the russian diplomat ... ... and they think he was mixed up in the mafia or something .
ay , dios !
and i thought my love life was crazy .
so we' il start at the library first and we' il fan out from there .
they' ve got all the la phone books , plus medical directories , things like that .
we' re not gonna let him hide from you any longer , right ?
all right !
i am going to make this my personal mission .
i can' t believe you' re doing all this for me , rosa .
i just wanna make sure that you get your ... fairy tale ending , or whatever .
at least one of us should .
thank you .

we were engaged .
you were engaged ?
i i beg your pardon ?
letting you go that was the biggest mistake of my life .
and it' s a mistake i' ve had to live with for six years , but i' ve put it behind me now .
and i just hope that you can put it behind you , too .
i' ve missed you .
i' ve missed you , david .
that' s ... very nice .
that was very good .
greatly appreciate that .
wow .
that was ...
wow !
the day i left you , i just drove and drove .
i drove all day and all that night , i just kept driving .
i stopped at this old country church ... ... and the pastor let me in .
and i sat ...
in the very first pew , where we would have sat on our wedding day .
i can' t believe i remembered that !
although i mean i should , i wrote it .
but that was seven years ago , and you' re quoting it verbatim .
i' m ... ... flattered , i think .
or frightened .
one or the other .
what' s your name ?
betty sizemore .
what do you write ?
i' m lyla branch .
i' m the producer .
uh huh ?
i have to admit you had me going there .
you' re better than most of them , anyway .
do you have a head shot ?
wait a second .
so what happens next , betty ?
are you sure you ...
well , why not ?
what ... what does happen next , betty ?
well , david came out to , uh , do his residency , and then he met leslie ...
no , no , no .
we know all that .
we want to know what happened to you , betty .
oh .
oh .
well ... ... i married a car salesman .
really ?
you were dumped for a car salesman , george .
a car salesman .
why' d you call him george ?
why did i call him ... ?
yeah , david .
tell us about the car salesman !
oh , right .
right .
well , you are , um , you' re talking about , uh ... ... fred , there .
del .
del .
del .
yeah .
uh , del , he was amazing .
he was ...
i mean , this guy , talk about salesmen ... ... he could sell anything to anybody at any time .
amazing .
you know del ?
i don' t know how to tell you this , but del and i go way back .
we went to school together .
as a matter of fact ... ... he saved my life .
oh , my gosh .
like , two more minutes in that freezing cold water ... ... and i swear to god i would have drowned but ...
del ...
del jumped in , and he grabbed me , and he just ... he pulled me out .
he was amazing .
hold on .
i' m having a moment here .
i lost touch with him after that , but ...
i still owe him .
he never said anything .
that is unbelievable !
funny .
that' s just what i was thinking .
i know !
i can' t tell you how much it hurt me to hear that you married him .
oh , i' m so sorry .
i tried to tell myself at first it was for the best .
that there was some sort of reason for it , but del ?
i was young .
and ... and stupid , and scared .
you never even gave us a chance .
i know .
i can' t tell you how many times i tell myself that same thing .
are you really crying right now ?
i' m just ...
i was just kinda playing along .
what are you ... ?
what are you doing , george ?
why does he keep calling you george ?
i don' t know .
listen ...
betty ?
i' m sure you' il understand ... ... david is a very busy man , so we really have to go .
now .
it was a pleasure meeting you .
we' ve got to get to this , uh , previous engagement .
oh .
but ... it was good .
it was so great .
all right .
i would be honoured if you' d join us .
what ... ... an idea .
i' m sure you two have a lot of catching up to do .
david !
yeah ?
all right .
thank you .
hold on a minute !
thank you .
hey , thanks , man .
i love your work .
oh , thank you .
thanks a lot .
hey , look who' s here !
what' s lonnie doing here ?
what happened to you ?
late , as usual .
i know .
why are you guys leaving ?
we did our 20 minutes .
who' s the skirt ?
apparently somebody who doesn' t like to be referred to as a skirt .
you !
relax , she didn' t even get you that hard .
do i know you ?
no .
but i know just who you are .
this doesn' t look like the kind of place betty would come to .
maybe she had to go to the bathroom ?
she does pee , doesn' t she ?
or is she too poised to pee ?
hey .
be careful with that .
... that hastened at my call
but when i met that little girl
i knew that i would fall
poor little fool , oh yeah
i was a fool , uh huh ...
what can i get you ?
we' re federal marshals , ma' am .
we' re looking for this young lady .
i haven' t seen her .
you sure have .
shut up , merle .
betty !
her name is betty .
i' ve never seen that woman before .
neither has merle .
he drinks too much .
and don' t try to tell me you' re cops .
i was married to a cop for nine years .
you' re not cops .
motherfuck !
what are you doin ' ?
shut up !
you haven' t been forthcoming with us .
so lyla' s very nice !
really tall .
yes , she is .
y' know , she said she thought that i was charming and relentless .
she said that i would go far in this town .
oh , and that unlike most charming and relentless people she knew ... ... she liked me .
well , she' s a good person to know .
so ... ... where did you study again ?
carlton .
carlton .
carlton school of nursing .
but i only went for two semesters , though .
because del ...
ah , right .
ok , ok .
ok .
i think you set the official record for staying in character ... ... about three hours ago now .
you just said that to me two hours ago .
oh ...
is it here ?
uh huh .
oh , great .
now .
gosh , i haven' t been this happy since i was 12 .
ok , i' il bite .
what happened when you were 12 ?
i took my mom to kansas city for mother' s day ... ... and i used the allowance i was saving .
we went to lunch at skies ... ... this restaurant at the top of a building ... ... and you can see the whole world from up there .
it was our last special day .
cos she died that year .
it was a great day .
you just gave me goosebumps from that , you know that ?
that is just great improv .
i just want everything to be perfect between us .
i know , i know .
listen , let' s ... let' s ...
time , here .
let' s ...
can we talk seriously for ... ... just a minute ?
uh huh .
i know how much you want this , betty ... ... and you are gifted and extremely determined .
but i gotta tell you , it is not entirely up to me .
i know .
it' s up to us .
i love you , david .
and i want to see you tomorrow , and the next day ... ... and the next day , and the next .
so were you with him this whole time ?
oh , you scared me .
mm hm .
still in love ?
mm hm .
this isn' t fair , you know ?
do you always get what you want ?
almost never .
i mean , you' re in love with someone who doesn' t exist .
you come out here , you meet this guy who should laugh in your face ... ... and instead you leave with him .
you' re like ... one of a kind .
thanks .
it was a totally rejuvenating , spiritual experience .
i know .
i was there .
i' m not denying that she' s good .
thank you , lupita .
you know she got a job as a nurse ?
method actress ?
david ravell ... is getting boring .
we know that .
well , couldn' t i have , like , a sister ... who' s a ... a twin , who' s evil ... ?
no !
we did that with lonnie .
remember the blind one last year ?
and he got the emmy thing for that ?
yeah .
i think we just bring betty down , throw her into the set and see what happens .
i don' t know .
i' d tell the cast .
they' d all be prepped .
i' il think about it .
it' d be like live television .
i mean , let' s live on the edge a little bit here !
come on , lyla !
we could break the mould .
i said i' il think about it .
now , let me tell you why i know she' s lying .
first place , betty would never fall for a soap star .
it' s beneath her .
i don' t know , that bartender sounded very serious .
no , betty' s here on business .
it' s the biggest market for what she' s selling .
wait , wait .
hold up , hold up .
that don' t make no sense !
what doesn' t make any sense ?
well , you obviously believed the lady !
shit , we' re all the way here in la !
so you believed her enough to come the fuck out here !
if you believed her that much , why is the rest of her story suddenly bullshit ?
i just don' t buy it .
don' t buy it !
call it instinct .
call it 35 years of professional know how .
i call it nutty as my shit after i eat an almond roca .
you need to remember who you' re talking to .
i need to get my fuckin ' head examined !
you can' t rule something out just cos you got a whim ... ... or you thought the bitch was fine !
i been followin ' your whims all across america !
and y' know what ?
i am fuckin ' tired !
wesley ...
it' s beneath her ?
the bitch is a fuckin ' housewife !
ain' t nothin ' beneath her !
so check this out .
what kind of car does jasmine drive ?
uh , mercedes , i think .
black .
so is she as fine in real life as she is on the show ?
better .
mm !
goddamn .
why don' t you help a brother sneak on the lot ?
sure .
good lookin ' out , baby .
good lookin ' out .
hey , man .
black mercedes .
lookin ' for a black mercedes .
she' s got ten kilos .
blonde , great figure .
sort of a wholesome doris day thing going on .
yeah , that' s what i said , doris day .
yeah , you could see her working at the un or someplace like that .
un .
united nations , man .
where it' s ...
never mind .
hi .
betty there ?
you don' t look like you do on tv .
and you must be rosa .
i' m george mccord .
well , i' ve heard so many great things about you .
not as much as i' ve heard about you .
these are for you .
hi .
oh , that' s nice !
well , i see you' ve met david .
yeah , i sure did .
funny thing , betty , he introduced himself to me as george .
oh , yeah .
he does that .
half the people who know him call him george .
i don' t think your friend rosa likes me very much .
oh , she' s probably just jealous .
oh .
she gets a little confused about men .
um , so where are we going ?
well , first i was thinking about patina , and then i thought about the lvy ... ... and then i thought about someplace a little more romantic .
like my place .
oh , great !
we' re going to the beach house .
no , i don' t live at the beach .
david ...
no , i moved to the hills .
i moved .
god , i haven' t felt like this since i was with stella adler in new york .
you' re just ... you' re ... you' re so real .
i don' t think you' ve ever mentioned a stella to me before .
oh , haven' t i ?
uh uh .
see , i would remember the name stella .
the only stella i ever knew was a parrot .
so was that before leslie ?
before us ?
i' ve never met anyone like you , betty .
well , that' s why we' re meant to be together .
your dedication scares me .
well , it' s easy to be dedicated when you care about something .
when i met you , it was like a warm breeze had suddenly blown into my life .
you remember that line ?
i said that to leslie during her funeral .
i love that line .
well ... ... you said it to her ... ... but you meant it for me , didn' t you ?
yeah .
maybe i did .
so i' m walkin ' down hollywood boulevard ... ... checkin ' out the stars on the ground , y' know , clint eastwood , rock hudson ... ... no people of race , not one fucking ...
i could not find people of race anywhere !
so i' m lookin ' at this chinese guy , right , and he' s reading his paper ... ... and who do i see ?
that' s lonnie , the main prick from the show .
and who is that next to him ?
betty !
i told you this ain' t no coincidence !
what the fuck ?
you been holdin ' out on me ?
this just does not fit her profile .
fuck the profile !
that' s the same guy !
no , no , no .
no , no , no .
betty would not be here because of a soap opera .
not a soap opera man !
that would make her ...
that would make her crazy !
no shit , shaft !
and you ain' t too far behind yourself !
no , no .
betty' s smarter than that !
how the fuck did you stay on this job so fuckin ' long ?
there you are , draggin ' our ass up and down the country !
meanwhile , our answer to our prayers are right in your back fucking pocket !
you let this cunt fuck up my ...
don' t you talk to betty that way !
i don' t care what she turns out to be , don' t you use that term again !
you hear me ?
you need therapy .
do you understand ?
yes , i understand !

and my instincts are telling me i' ve got to see this through with her .
and if there' s anything i' ve tried to teach you here ...

i' ve no idea what del was mixed up in .
so you had nothing to do with the drugs ?
oh , my god !
drugs ?
god , no !
i am totally against drugs .
life is very strange .
i really had you pegged ... ... as a cold blooded bitch .
i mean , not that i didn' t still admire you for it .
if you didn' t come here to kill me , then ... ... why are you here ?
to see you .
how' d you two dumb fucks find betty ?
i just put it all together .
i knew that david , lonnie and chloe were from that show .
betty thinks they' re real people .
sounded strange , but it was worth a shot .
what do you want ?
ignore him .
and don' t take that tape off .
you' re gonna regret it .
you are such a liar , elden ballard !
oh , shut up !
i' m the one that figured it out , not him !
shut up , man !
you are really smart ?
fuck you , roy ostrey !
look , shut up !
i' m the one that watched the ...
shut the fuck up !
shut the fuck up , both of you , before i kill both of you !
you watched the show ?
yeah !
i' m the one that watched the show !
he' s the one that didn' t , cos he' s a liar !
calm down !
stop acting like a little bitch .
now , did chloe crack ?
chloe fell completely apart !
you didn' t know chloe cracked , did you ?
agh !
what about jasmine ?
jasmine' s a lesbian .
lying motherfucker !
you lie !
jasmine is not a lesbian !
i know what i' m talking about !
mm !
mm !
what you want ?
you scream , you die .
i' m gonna take this shit off .
you scream , you fucking die !
i have a tape of today' s show .
jasmine you got a lot of men in motion over what you did .
what i did ?
don' t give me that , chloe !
what about what he did ?
i wasn' t born yesterday .
you get in a man' s car , there' s a reason .
we both know that .
do you think that maybe ... ?
oh , no , they' re fine .
i don' t meet people like you .
i' m a garbage man of the human condition .
i deal with trash .
people who would trade in part of themselves ... ... for a few more minutes of their rotten lives .
but you' re different .
i am ?
yeah .
you could probably have anything you want .
someone as beautiful and stylish as you are .
and you don' t even realise it .
i just don' t think i' m who you think i am .
let me just ...
let me just get this out .
i like walks in the rain , and sunsets , and symphonies ... ... kids , animals .
i read passionately .
i like to discuss things .
i ...
i guess , basically , i' m conservative ... ... but flexible .
i' ve followed you all the way across the country ... ... y' know , and i' ve come to feel that ... ... we are a lot more alike than you think .
but i thought you said that you were the garbage man of humanity .
i just ... ... hoped i could leave that behind me .
i thought no meant no .
scoffs what ?
say something .
first of all ... ... don' t insult my intelligence by telling me that david ravell attacked you in that car .
so , um , that jasmine ... ... she certainly is intriguing , isn' t she ?
jasmine ain' t no dyke .
she' s just tryin ' to find herself .
you' re my only friend .
look at the titties on jasmine .
you' re my only friend .
goddamn !
ah , sooky sooky , now !
rub her titties .
rub her titties !
you can do that shit on tv ?
oh , shit !
look at that shit !
put jasmine in and i walk out !
you would never cook up a scheme like this , would you ?
what the ... !
oh , shit !
c' mere !
wesley !
get over there .
daddy !
what the ...
wesley ?
oh , my god !
my fish are out there !
i know .
they' re inashiki koi .
how' d you know that ?
hey !
we' re in a shoot out here !
you wanna shut up about the damn fish ?
no , elden , you shut up !
i' il get your fish .
roy !
oh , christ .
what ?
they shot my boy .
my son is dead .
sorry .
you' re the reason i' m here .
that' s right , i' m here because of you .
oh .
shit .
i need my other gun .
check his jacket .
i' il cover you .
no , let' s wait for the real police .
i am the real police !
so why can' t we just sneak outside , huh ?
lady , you don' t just run away from crime .
and betty' s in there !
so all of this really is because of a soap opera ?
my son is dead because ... ... you wanted to be with this doctor .
this fake doctor .
well , too late , anyway .
you could at least give me my gun .
maybe i could shoot my way out .
take a couple of ' em with me .
i think i' d rather not .
betty , please .
please .
i don' t want to shrivel up alone in some stinking prison .
no way .
i' ve got my professional pride .
and ... ... i don' t want somebody else to get credit for taking me out .
i want you to listen to me .
betty ... ... you never needed that actor .
you don' t need that doctor .
you don' t need any man .
it' s not the forties , you know ?
honey , you don' t need anybody .
you know why ?
hm .
because you' ve got yourself .
in a story that police say is bizarre even for hollywood ... ... a father son team of killers tracked a kansas soap opera fan ... ... halfway across the country ... ... only to find themselves the victims in a final , bloody confrontation .
we go now to bb burke at the scene ...
that' s our betty .
this story is beyond belief !
which is perfect for us .
it' s free advertising , it' s gonna run for months .
i don' t think she can do it .
i really don' t .
are you serious ?
did you see what happened ?
well , who wouldn' t freeze under those circumstances ?
and i don' t care what her problems are .
she wouldn' t be the first person in the cast with problems .
that' s why we have nothing to lose by sending you to talk to her .
me ?
ok .
let' s talk about me .
what about my feelings about all this ?
i don' t really care about your feelings .
i did like your icy water idea the other day , though .
yeah ?
i' m toying with the idea of killing david ravell off in a boating accident .
one of those castaway deals with chloe and ...
no ?
how do i come back ?
no , no , no .
no .
don' t ...
don' t try the blackmail bullshit with me , lyla , cos it' s kinda ... it' s beneath you .
so don' t even think about it .
it' s an emphatic no , missy .
poom !
end of story , right there .
i' m sorry for what i did .
i' m sorry for the things that i ... said ... ... and for not respecting you ... ... and just all the stupid little things that i was ...
when you have a minute .
i really don' t like the idea of autographs ... ... and i' m kinda in a moment right here , so ...
it' s the check .
sorry about that .
uh ... no , i got this .
my treat .
it' s not the forties , y' know .
ok .
do you know that my best friend once said ... ... that if you were any handsomer , it would be a crime .
thank you .
it' s just too bad that you' re such an asshole .
that' s ok .
you know what ?
that' s ok .
that' s all right .
i' m ...
i' m ok with that .
that' s fair enough .
now we' ve , uh , settled the whole asshole thing , uh ... ... is there any chance that you would think about joining the show ?
at all ?
there' s always a chance , david .
but what about tomorrow , and the next day ... ... and the next day , and the next ?
if you were any handsomer , doctor ... ... it' d be a crime .
i take it that means you' re free tomorrow ?
i was going to ask you that , too !
it' s as if i' ve been in some sort of dream state .
like ...
like you didn' t know who you were , or what you were doing ?
yes .
daniel , ven !
aqu est la novela !
i have that effect on people .
well , you certainly had that effect on me . siempre hay una possibilit , david .
ma tu ci sarai domani , e domani , e domani ancora ?
dottore ... ... pi bello di cos , si muore .
credo di capire che sei libera stasera ?
io , ti amo , david .
ti amo , geri .
gasps
excuse me , sir ?
sir ?
