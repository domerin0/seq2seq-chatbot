you ?
you again ?
get out !
go on , i told you .
get out !
go on !
go on !
papa !
you filthy dog !
you settle with me !
ha ...
let' s go .
welcome to you , seor .
my name is juan de dios .
i am the bell ringer .
why are you here ?
to see the rojos ?
no , not the rojos .
is it the baxters ?
no , maybe not .
you want to get rich ?
well , it' s the right place .
if you use your head .
that' s because everybody here has become very rich , or else they are dead .
what do you want to buy ?
some guns ?
liquor ?
you don' t buy , you sell .
you sell lead in exchange for gold ?
you will get rich here .
or you' il be killed .
juan de dios tolls the bell once again .
saludos , amigo .
it' s not smart to go wandering so far from home .
i reckon he picked the wrong trail .
or he could have picked the wrong town .
his big mistake was getting born .
you want any work ,
iookin ' like that , ya could try bein ' a scarecrow !
oh , no !
the crows are liable to scare him maybe .
ha ha !
hello .
saludos .
you can' t get rich like that !
at most , you will only succeed in being killed !
we have enough trouble .
what are you looking for ?
food , somethin ' to drink .
water' s over there .
no .
no water .
eating , drinking , killing .
that' s all you can do , just like the rest of your kind .
by the way , you' il have to mark this up .
i know , you have no money .
after all , you just got into town .
but if you don' t mind killing , you will find someone eager to pay you .
hm mm .
my roulette wheel .
that , too , was murdered .
no one ever comes here to play .
we spend our time between funerals and burials .
yeah .
never saw a town as dead as this one .
you will never see another like it .
what' s wrong with the place ?
we' ve had too many killings .
you have seen the women ?
none of them are women , they' re widows .
the place has only widows .
here , you can only gain respect by killing other men .
so nobody works .
somebody doesn' t share your opinion .
yes .
saludos !
you know why piripero looked you over ?
to take your measurements .
he can do it with a glance .
you will be a customer .
hm .
i' m not joking .
those murderers will make a corpse out of you one day .
that' s why i want you to get out of here .
you don' t want to stay in this cemetery , finish up and get out .
i told ya i can' t pay ya .
be my guest .
but get out of san miguel , will you ?
where does that lead ?
the balcony .
why are you going there ?
hey !
to have a look .
things always look different from higher up .
but nothing' s up there !
go ahead and get out !
who are they ?
hm .
bandits .
bandits and smugglers .
they come down from texas to stock up on guns and liquor .
the cost is much less here .
they sell guns and liquor to the lndians .
any town that sells guns and liquor has gotta be rich .
not the town .
only those who buy and sell .
the bosses are the ones who clean up .
somebody has to run the place .
every town has a boss .
that' s true , but when there are two , i' d say that there is one too many .
two bosses ?
very interesting .
interesting is right .
the rojos , three brothers who sell liquor .
and then there' s the baxters , big gun merchants .
ah , if i' m not mistaken , you already met baxter' s gang .
yeah , we met .
but you' re lucky .
they don' t usually limit their fire to the mule .
a man looks around for any reason ,
juan de dios tolls the bell , piripero sells another coffin .
two bosses .
they' ve enlisted all the scum from both sides of the frontier .
and they pay in dollars .
baxters over there .
rojos there .
me right in the middle .
where you do what ?
crazy bell ringer was right .
there' s money to be made in a place like this .
if you' re thinking what i suspect i tell you , don' t try it .
which one of the two is the stronger ?
which one of them is stronger ?
well , the rojos , especially ramon .
don miguel rojo , i wanna talk to you .
don miguel , i hear you' re hirin ' on men .
well , i might just be available .
i gotta tell ya before you hire me ,
i don' t work cheap .
get three coffins ready .
huh ?
adios , amigo .
stranger , didn' t you get the idea ?
we don' t like bad boys like you in town .
go get your mule .
you let him get away from you ?
that' s what i wanna talk about .
he' s feelin ' real bad .
huh ?
my mule .
you see , he got all riled up when you fired those shots at his feet .
hey , are you makin ' some kinda joke ?
no .
i understand you were playin ' around .
but the mule , he just doesn' t get it .
if you were to all apologise ...
i don' t think it' s nice , you laughin ' .
see , my mule don' t like people laughin ' .
he gets the idea you' re laughin ' at him .
now , if you apologise , like i know you will ,
i might convince him that you really didn' t mean it .
i saw it .
you killed all four of them .
you' il pay , all right .
you' il be strung up .
who are you ?
don' t fire a shot .
i' m john baxter sheriff .
yeah .
well , if you' re the sheriff , you better get these men underground .
my mistake .
four coffins .
hey !
i told you i wasn' t cheap , but i think you' il find it' s worth your while . .. 98 , 99 , 100 .
the rest when you' re all done .
when do i start ?
i' m not in a hurry , at least for the moment .
with four less baxters , now is as good a time to start as any .
in a few days , a troop of cavalry will pass through san miguel .
i wouldn' t want the military sticking their long noses into our business .
you seem to be well informed .
in these parts , a man' s life often depends on a mere scrap of information .
hm .
this thing couldn' t have been very useful to its owner .
my brother ramon did that !
he often uses it for target practice .
with a gun in his hand , no one stands in his way .
the armour is one of his favourite targets .
naturally , when he doesn' t have anything better to shoot .
well , i' il be kinda curious to meet this brother of yours .
ah , this is chico , one of the most trusted of my men .
follow him .
he will bring you to your room .
i would like you to feel at home .
well , i never found home that great .
let' s go .
who' s that ?
her name is marisol .
you just forget about her .
this one will be your room .
you gave him 100 .
we' ve never paid that much before .
can you explain why you have taken him on ?
to have a filthy gringo here , and to give him 100 besides ?
we have never paid anybody so much .
you cannot leave someone like that to do what he wants !
he might do anything and i want law and order in this place !
if that is all you want , there is a much cheaper way .
just snuff him out .
and who will be the one ?
you ?
yes .
why not ?
a shot in his back and then you would have him out of the way in no time at all .
listen , i could do it easily right now .
he won' t be expecting it , and i' d get back the 100 .
you are stupid , esteban !
even if you are my brother !
a bullet in the back and it is ended !
and what happens if your hand should tremble and he' s only been hurt ?
with the cavalry arriving in town , and that yankee so quick on the draw ...
but i was only thinking ...
don' t think !
you let me do the thinking .
go and see the americano .
ask if he needs anything .
make friends .
get one thing clear .
this is going to be a quiet town until ramon gets back !
is that clear ?
a quiet town .
i am esteban rojo .
my brother asked me to ...
what are you doing ?
moving .
but didn' t you know all our men live here with us ?
that' s all very cosy , but , uh , i don' t find you men all that appealin ' .
besides , your brother said he didn' t have any need for me any more right now .
halt !
sergeant .
yes , capitan ?
tell the men we' il spend tonight here .
arrange it so they can pick up the supplies here .
also double the guard on the stagecoach there .
yes , sir .
now , what do you suppose is in that coach ?
it would be easy to find out .
get up close and take a look inside .
if they fire at you , you know it' s gold .
not a bad idea .
mm .
looking for anything ?
hello .
get out of here , yankee .
vamos .
why aren' t you sleeping ?
when i see you staring like that , it bothers me .
i keep wondering what was in that stagecoach .
it' s something they think is very important .
i asked a few questions of the captain and almost was arrested .
who' s marisol ?
you' d better get some sleep .
you need it .
much too dangerous , even for you .
all i did is ask who she was .
she is a woman .
ramon' s madly in love with her .
does that make it clear to you ?
mm .
everybody in this town talks about ramon .
i' m curious to meet him .
if you' re smart , you' il try to stay clear of ramon as long as possible .
ah !
there are the soldiers .
they' re moving off very quietly .
strange .
they' re headed for the frontier .
tell me , is that the way you go to bed every night ?
don' t worry .
i didn' t dirty the sheets .
no , wait !
i' m coming , too !
i want to see how you' re going to get in trouble .
ha ha .
all right , all right .
go ahead .
it' s like playing cowboys and lndians .
captain .
welcome , lieutenant .
there is your gold as promised .
i hope the guns you are giving us will be equally useful to our army .
rest assured , captain .
we' il check ' em over together .
get their clothes on again , and hurry .
be sure to place them around right .
they died fighting among themselves .
rubio !
there .
it' s ramon .
this is my brother ramon .
i think i mentioned him .
everybody talks about ramon .
and many speak of you , too .
my dear brother included .
well , i hope they say ... nice things ?
did you have a good trip ?
it was tiring .
it was terribly hard on the road during the day .
and stagecoaches are an uncomfortable way to travel .
well , i' m sure you' il be in great shape in no time .
the americano cannot wait to get into action !
i am sorry .
he is going to be a disappointed man .
how' s that ?
the baxters accepted the invitation .
they' il come tonight , don miguel .
you must be out of your head !
i told chico to invite them here .
ramon , what is this ?
i found out many things travelling .
i have decided that ... it' s very stupid .
we just keep on shooting at each other and without results .
you' ve gone out of your mind , ramon !
no , i' ve come to my senses , esteban .
believe me .
trust me .
life can be so precious .
it' s foolish to risk losing it every minute , no ?
there' s enough space for everybody in this town .
even baxters , hm ?
for this reason ,
i' ve decided to hang my gun up on the wall .
i think that ramon is right .
i , too , am tired of these killings .
they must stop !
this is all ... very , very touching .
you don' t admire peace ?
it' s not really easy to like something you know nothing about .
stay here and you may just profit from the experience .
no , thanks .
i' il be movin ' on .
here' s your money , don miguel .
i only used a small amount of it .
i don' t like to take money unless i feel i' ve earned it .
why are you so hasty ?
stay here .
you might enjoy dining with us tonight .
you see , the baxters have four men in the cemetery on account of me .
i don' t think they' d appreciate my presence .
he is too smart to be just a hired fighter .
with a pistol , no one can touch him .
when someone with that face works with his gun , count on two things .
he' s fast , but he' s also intelligent .
that makes him too dangerous for you .
now he' s gone , explain that nonsense about hanging up your gun and making up with the baxters .
is it possible that you' il never be able to reach any conclusions on your own ?
our government and the americanos will find those bodies and investigate .
they' il investigate , all right .
and we' il be quiet and peacefully bide our time .
we know nothing about a massacre at the rio bravo , eh ?
i arranged for the bodies to be lying as if both companies killed each other .
but do you think they' il believe it ?
ah , yes , i think so .
because if they don' t find a guilty party , they will call off the investigation .
yes , but ... what about the baxters ?
the baxters ?
they want nothing more than to live in peace .
we' il let them have their own way for a while .
so , forget the baxters .
we' il take care of them later when the investigation finishes !
that was a fine idea that you had .
what was it again ?
ah , yes , yes , yes , yes .
the baxters on one side , the rojos on the other .
and you' d be in the middle .
the only problem is that they' ve joined up .
now you have no job and no money to pay me what you owe me .
there is only one thing for you to do .
leave .
i' il forget about what you owe me .
leave san miguel and never come back for the rest of your days .
hey , joe !
i prepared the wagon the way you asked me to .
we' re sitting in the back here with two empty coffins .
what are you up to ?
are you changing your profession ?
if you want to go on living , you' d better .
in my opinion , you will make a fine pallbearer .
close this place and come with me .
oh , close up , huh ?
it' s done .
where are we going ?
i' d like to know , or is it a secret ?
down by the river , to have a look at some corpses down there .
the rojos say come to dinner and we must go , but i don' t like it at all .
even if they' ve granted all the guarantees we demanded .
we' il go along with it , but don' t touch anything !
you mustn' t eat .
you mustn' t drink .
you just keep your eyes open and keep your wits about you .
whoa ...
are you sure that nobody has seen us ?
only a ghost or two .
no , no , no .
don' t joke about things like this .
ghosts are better left where they are .
you look as though this place suits you very well .
and if you go on like this , you will soon be here permanently .
hee hee !
why is it , with all those bodies , we are just burying these two ?
we' re not ... gonna bury ' em .
we are not burying them ?
that' s right , we' re not gonna bury ' em .
if we are not burying them , i would like to know what we will use them for ?
why are we taking the trouble to do this ?
the dead can be very useful sometimes .
they' ve helped me outta tough spots more than once .
first , they don' t talk .
second , they can be made to look alive if i manage it right .
yeah .
and third , if you shoot ' em , there' s no worry cos they' re dead already .
understand ?
it makes no sense to me and i' m getting out !
i' m alive and i want to remain with the living .
and when i' m dead , i' il want to remain with the dead .
i hope that' s clear .
also , i don' t like the idea that you' ve placed those bodies there .
the man buried there is the only one who ever died of pneumonia here !
take it easy , will ya ?
our friends here are gonna help me pay your bill .
ah , get up there !
their only reason to start a war would be to kidnap you from your husband' s side .
he is gallant , this rojo .
i didn' t think him capable of compliments .
he' s not .
all that he says is false , like his proposals .
you women ! lf things aren' t complicated for you , you become suspicious .
yes .
because to me it just didn' t seem right .
it went too smoothly .
i don' t trust them .
you' d like to prove me wrong , wouldn' t you ?
always the same thing .
goodnight .
goodnight .
don' t worry .
i' m not gonna hurt ya .
i just want ya to know why the rojos wanna make peace all of a sudden .
there was once a wagonload of gold that the soldiers were takin ' to the border .
john !
come up here quickly .
sorry .
when a husband finds a man in his wife' s bedroom , you' re never sure how he' s gonna react .
give him 500 .
how' s that ?
give the money to him .
he has an interesting story .
listen to him .
that' s the right idea ?
i get the wrong idea only when it suits me .
ramon !
the soldiers escorting the gold ...
two of them got away .
they' re hiding out in the cemetery .
the baxters are about to capture them .
hey !
rubio !
get the men .
you are well informed .
a man' s life here often depends on a mere scrap of information .
your brother' s own words .
tell me , why are you doing this for us ?
500 .
with these two soldiers as witnesses against ramon , the government will rid the town of the rojos .
then san miguel will have just one boss .
hurry !
let' s go !
coming with us ?
no , no .
when a man' s got money in his pocket , he appreciates peace .
come on !
whoa !
let' s leave the horses here .
por dios !
who is there ?
come out !
ohh !
what do you think ?
i don' t know .
there' s somethin ' about it i don' t like .
too still to be wounded , more like dummies .
sure !
dummies that interest the rojos .
better hide .
hurry !
what do we do ?
circle around to the side .
keep them busy long enough for me to get those two .
go on !
go on !
quickly !
keep me covered .
i' il take care of those two .
listen , baxter !
you can have them now if you like !
since dead men can' t talk !
it seems they didn' t like my joke .
we' il let them go home in a while .
this bad boy will be our guest only until baxter leaves san miguel for the frontier .
put him in the cellar .
esteban , good work !
with antonio as our prisoner , the baxters will have to give in to us .
now we can make any kind of demand !
don miguel !
don miguel !
what has happened ?
talk , will you !
i don' t know who , but somebody shot at me .
marisol !
marisol !
where are you , marisol ? !
strange ... how you always manage to be in the right place at the right time .
it' s nothing serious , a headache that will pass .
she' il sleep .
keep your eyes open .
she' s not to move from that room , you hear ?
i wouldn' t mention i brought her here .
i wouldn' t want the rojos to think i was on your side .
don' t be worried .
i' m rich enough to appreciate the men that my money can buy .
i' ve been to talk to the rojos .
they' il give back antonio in exchange for marisol in the morning .
very soon , you' re going to be rich .
uh huh .
yeah , that' s not gonna break my heart .
where is she ?
you said i' d see her !
where is she ?
i want to see her !
come back here , jesus .
come here .
i want to see her !
why can' t i look at her ?
i want to see her !
go .
go to him , marisol .
mama !
mama !
jesus !
mama !
jesus !
mama !
mama !
mama !
julio .
marisol .
get julio .
you were warned to get outta town .
now i' m gonna make you pay once and for all .
let him be .
you better get goin ' .
ramon' s waitin ' .
and you , get that kid home where he belongs .
a pig , that ramon !
tell me , what' s ramon got to do with them ?
you weren' t told , eh ?
in these parts , the story is very old .
a happy little family until trouble comes along .
trouble is ramon .
claiming the husband cheated at cards , which wasn' t true , he gets the wife to live with him as hostage .
the husband ?
him , there' s nothing for him to do .
the rojos threatened to kill his boy , jesus .
he was forced to accept things .
that ramon is smart .
where are you going ?
to the rojos , to look for a job .
poo !
i' m glad we have the americano with us .
it' s the best thing to happen to us .
if either government starts an enquiry , we' il need every man we can get .
to be at war with the baxters now is worse than sitting on a case of dynamite .
where should we put this ?
put it over there .
come on , everybody .
drink up !
good shooting .
very good shooting .
to kill a man , you shoot for his heart , and a winchester is the best weapon .
that' s very nice , but i' il stick with my . 45 .
when a man with a . 45 meets a man with a rifle , the man with the pistol will be a dead man .
that' s an old mexican proverb , and it' s true .
you believe that ?
paquito , take five men and escort marisol to the small house .
everything is prepared .
do not worry .
i will return tomorrow .
the wagons are ready .
we can leave .
everyone !
enjoy yourselves during my absence !
you heard ramon , let' s have a good time .
he weighs over a ton .
of course , with all he poured into himself .
papa , did you not tell me no one could go see mama ?
that' s right .
then , why does that man see her when i cannot ?
i want mama !
come away from the door .
quiet .
we cannot show ourselves .
you must stay away .
hello .
there' s somebody shooting at the small house .
saddle the horses immediately !
come on , let' s go !
look out !
take this money .
it' s enough to live on for a while .
now , get across the border .
get as far away from san miguel as possible .
how may we thank you for what you are doing ?
don' t try .
just get goin ' before the rojos get here .
why do you do this for us ?
why ?
i knew someone like you once .
no one was there to help .
get movin ' .
get movin ' .
get outta here !
what do you see , chico ?
they' re all dead .
they massacred them .
they kidnapped marisol !
this looks like the work of the baxters .
quick !
let' s get back before they attack our house in the town .
chico , give out the ammunition .
esteban , spread your men around the house .
keep your eyes open .
miguel , paco , behind the house .
manolo and alvaro , come with me .
stay alert !
the way they killed those men , there must be a lot of them .
it' s a warm evening .
one of our wagons lost a wheel so we had to turn back here to get help .
one of the men tells me ... the baxters attacked the small house .
do you know about it ?
tell me what you know .
oh !
well ?
where did you hide marisol ?
rubio .
you are thirsty ?
you want to drink ?
no , no .
it is too soon to drink .
ooh !
bring him over here .
you are a stubborn idiot .
tell us where marisol is and it' il all be ended .
in a week , you' il be back in shape , and you can go wherever you want .
that' s enough for today .
sooner or later he' il talk .
it' s just a matter of time .
he mustn' t escape or die .
otherwise , do as you like .
wait till he comes to .
this way he hardly feels anything .
i have a poker hand waiting for me .
now i am stuck here !
i can' t get back to it !
this is more amusing than cards .
just be sure he does not die , and also make sure he regrets the day he was born .
the gringo is asleep , i imagine .
that' s all right .
i' il enjoy waking him up .
esteban , what was that noise ?
i do not know .
i heard a yell and then a crash .
it' s useless to hide !
you are finished playing the smart boy .
go up and look in the loft !
and take a look behind the barrels !
let' s get out of here !
hurry !
hurry !
come on !
you , come along with me !
surround the town !
block the streets leading out !
find him for me !
esteban , search the whole town !
follow me !
get him back right now !
you' ve got to at any cost !
look in the stables , in every corral , in the store !
look for him in the church !
go in there !
search every inch of it !
search everywhere !
rubio , in here !
if somebody is hiding him , burn their house down and kill them !
you , come here !
look for him near the baxters ' , but take him alive .
i want him alive !
alive !
rubio , ... in the bar .
he says he knows nothing .
he' s being smart .
bring him here to me .
i swear i' m telling the truth .
well , ... you know nothing , huh ?
nothing !
i have not seen him !
rubio , you take care of him !
where have you hidden him ?
i ... didn' t ... hide ...
you are the right friend for that filthy americano .
you' il end up the same way .
we looked everywhere .
in his cellar , in the attic , on the roof , but there is no trace .
i couldn' t find anybody in the back room .
he has taken refuge with the baxters .
the americano isn' t stupid .
he knows that' s the best place to hide .
the baxters , eh ?
then better go and get him .
and that' s for being his friend .
curse them !
piripero !
eh ?
piripero !
hm ?
come here .
i can' t see anybody .
come here .
dios mio !
what are you doing in there ?
never mind .
get me outta here .
but you' re not dead yet .
i will be , if you don' t get me outta here quick .
get the lid down .
rubio .
i see some signs of life .
let' s be ready when they decide to come out .
don' t shoot !
we surrender !
don' t shoot !
don' t shoot !
we' re coming out !
i surrender !
hold back your fire !
don' t shoot !
we' re surrendering !
stop .
i wanna take a look at this .
ramon !
don' t shoot !
we' re comin ' out .
we surrender !
listen , you' ve won !
it' s enough !
i' il get outta town !
i' il do whatever you like !
you promise that ?
i swear it , ramon !
you won' t try any tricks ?
none .
no , no tricks .
i said before , i give you my word , we' il leave !
are you sure ?
you had better ask permission of your wife .
maybe she won' t be too happy !
antonio !
john !
murderers .
they had no guns !
murderers !
i hope you rot in hell !
may you all die spitting blood !
curse you for this !
murderers !
let' s go .
the show' s over anyway .
keep looking for him !
search among those bodies !
the filthy americano has to be somewhere .
silvanito ?
where' s silvanito ?
any news today ?
i have to tell you some bad news .
i hate to tell you this , joe , but ...
where is silvanito ?
he was captured this morning by those men of ramon' s .
they grabbed him on his way here .
he was bringing in some provisions .
he is being tortured , but he won' t talk .
he' s stubborn .
whatever they do , he won' t say a word , even if it means his life .
listen to me .
they' il never be able to force him .
now , old fool , loosen up your tongue .
no .
rubio !
get back to your shop .
you' re liable to have business there .
very good !
that' s what i wanted to hear .
i brought a little surprise for you .
i know how much you will need it .
it was hard to get my hands on it .
i got it by using my head .
no one can resist two bottles of wine .
i thought you might need that pistol .
and i brought another present .
it' s dynamite .
i stole it from the rojos .
the moment' s come for you to light the fuse and send it back to them .
still lots of light .
too early to be asleep yet .
rubio , here .
i shouldn' t like to ruin the rifle .
i could never find another like this one .
later , ramon .
let' s try it with this one now .
gringo !
i heard you wanted to see me .
the americano' s dead .
cut the old man down .
what' s wrong , ramon ?
