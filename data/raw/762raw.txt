the oubyamywe peninsula .
a remote and fascinating region teeming with extraordinary marine life .
we chose its mysterious waters as the belafonte' s next destination .
in preparation for our voyage ... the members ofteam zissou gathered at my oceanographic observatory ... here on pescespada island .
this was to be our most ambitious adventure to date ... and ultimately a tragic one .
our team included ...
eleanor zissou , my wife , vice president of the zissou society .
we had also invited seven marine science students from the university of north alaska ... to accompany us as unpaid interns in exchange for school credit .
october 12 .
esteban and i explore the blue reefs beyond the peninsula .

he should have an answer for us in 10 days .

he wants to make a big to do of the oceanographic explorer article .

so do be nice to this girl , miss winslett richardson , won' t you ?

oseary , this is , uh , probably my son , ned .

let me tell you about my boat .
the belafonte was a long range sub hunter during the second world war ... which we bought from the u. s. navy for $900, 000 .
this is my mentor , lord mandrake .
he' s dead now .
the sauna ... was designed by an engineer from the chinese space program ... and we keep a swedish masseuse on staff .
here' s where we do all our different science projects and experiments and so on .
this is the kitchen ... which contains probably some of the most technologically advanced equipment on the ship .
eleanor put together a top notch research library for us ... with a complete first edition set of the life aquatic companion series .
we process our own rushes ... and keep a cutting room onboard so we can do an assembly while shooting .
i can' t find them !
once again , please .
this is the observation bubble ... which i thought up in a dream , actually .
two albino scouts swim with the ship .
they' re supposedly very intelligent ... although i' ve never seen any evidence of it .
here is the engine room .
the bearing casings aren' t supposed to look like that ... but we can' t afford to fix them this year .
topside we' ve got the bridge , the minisub , an old chopper ... and all kinds of radar and sonar and underwater movie gadgets .
what happened tojacqueline ?
she didn' t really love me .
lord mandrake .
it' s wonderful .
very lifelike .
i' m not crazy about it .
this guy' s a big time asshole .
we were roommates at the academy .
he used to be married to eleanor .
he hogs up all the grant money .
you think you' il want to change your name ?
ned ?
no , not the ned part .
unless you want to .
i meant your last name .
i thought you might like to let me give you mine .
ned zissou .
ned zissou .
exactly .
or , if you want to , you can change the first part too .
i would have named you kingsley , if i' d had a say in it .
kingsley .
i don' t know .
maybe i' il stick with ned for now .
sure .
that' s okay .
anyway , i' il order you some correspondence stock .
what are you doing ?
i ordered the wine .
pour it over here , please .
he doesn' t know anything about wine .
are those assholes talking about me ?
eh ?
people say when someone says something like that about you ... it' s because they' re jealous .
but it still hurts .
it hurts bad .
that man was damn rude .
he can go straight to hell .
how did she die , by the way , your mother ?
she took her own life .
she took sleeping pills .
why would she do that ?
well , she was in a great deal of pain , you know .
oh .
i see .
yeah .
you know , my best friend just got killed .
esteban .
yeah , i know .
the old man .
let' s go to my island .
well , i , uh i have to be back in kentucky on thursday .
thursday ?
okay .
that' s okay .
your cat' s dead .
what ?
which one ?
marmalade .
i' m sorry .
what happened ?
a rattlesnake bit it in the throat .
goddamn it , eleanor , why do you have to say it like that ?
you couldn' t try to break it a little bit nicer ?
she' s a rich bitch , you know .
she was raised by maids .
her parents paid for this island ... and two of my worst movies .
people say she' s the brains behind team zissou .
people say a lot of things .
what kind of cat was it ?
who gives a shit ?
i think it was a tabby .
ned , wanna come inside , we' il make up a room for you ?
steve , that reporter called .
ned , wake up .
yes ?
i' m on the echo box .
push the red button to answer .
throw on your slop and meet me on the beach in 12 minutes .
the white button ?
okay .
action !
only twice before have i had the good fortune to observe a rubber tide ... that rare occurrence when hundreds of electric jellyfish ... spontaneously wash onto a beachhead at once .
bobby ogata brings exactly this to our attention tonight .
steve , what produces this effect of illumination ?
is there a chemical inside the organism ?
no , ned .
actually , it' s the reflection of the moonlight on their outer membranes .
that' s a very good , uh , ad lib .
klaus , come over here and get a two shot of me and ned .
ned , come in here .
would you like to join my crew ?
would i like to  i want you on team zissou .
i don' t think i can do that .
why not ?
well , it' s not my field .
i don' t have the background for it .
no one here does .
klaus used to be a bus driver .
wolodarsky was a high school substitute teacher .
we' re a pack of strays .
don' t you get it ?
steve , i' m not even that strong a swimmer .
the answer' s yes .
well , it' s got to be .
i' il order you a red cap and a speedo .
cut .
klaus , why aren' t you rolling ?
could i have a word with you , please ?
why aren' t you getting this ?
that was a goddamn tearjerker .
why did you cut it , man ?
because the sound is going to be shit .
he doesn' t even know how to hold a boom .
he doesn' t know diddly jack about what we' re doing .
don' t cut unless i say " cut .
i' ve never seen so many electric jellyfish in all my life !
those are vietcong man of wars .
oh , shit .
she' s right .
i guess we' il have to loop that line .
where' d you come from ?
you look pregnant .
i am pregnant .
i' m not even going to ask what you men are doing out here in your matching pajamas .
we' re producing a film , as a matter of fact .
who are you ?
i' m jane winslett richardson .
i' m the reporter from the oceanographic explorer .
oh , yeah , sure .
how' d you get out here ?
i hired some drunk in a fishing boat .
that would take four hours .
why would you do that ?
because no one picked me up at the f ing airport !
jesus christ , klaus .
one of my guys was supposed to do that .
how long have you been working with zissou ?
uh , approximately
only 10 minutes , actually .
i was hired during the scene on the beach .
he' s steve' s son , supposedly .
you are ?
no , you' re not .
he doesn' t have one .
well , we' re not 100 % sure about that yet .
we just met yesterday .
not this one , klaus .
hmm ?
you heard me .
not this one .
okay .
first thing in the morning , huh ?
just print everything ?
yeah .
tell ' em to push it a stop and a half .
okay .
what are you gonna do with him ?
who ?
ned ?
what do you mean ?
i don' t understand the question .
i offered him a spot on the belafonte .
he didn' t take it , did he ?
of course he took it .
we' re gonna put him on the map , eleanor .
we' re gonna throw him a life preserver .
i believe in this boy . !
why ?
because he looks up to me .
yes , sir .
and mckinnon' s willing to take over my shuttle flights .
that' s right .
well , i just feel i need to see this thing through , sir .
thank you for understanding .
i' il check in with the louisville office again next month .
piano , classical ]
any strong impression ...
since i had not , as they say ...
enough power of observation ' ...
to isolate their sense of color .
for a long time afterwards , whenever i thought ofher ...
the memory of those bright eyes would at once present itself to me ...
as a vivid azure ...
since her complexion was fair .
so much so that , perhaps ifher eyes had not been quite so black ...
which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her ...
" i should not have been , as i was ... so especially enamored of their imagined blue
hold it .
that' s poetry ?
no .
it' s a six volume novel .
oh , i see .
you' re gonna read that whole thing to yourself out loud ?
i' m not reading it to myself .
i' m reading it to him .
when did you learn zissou was your father ?
does it freak you out for me to ask that ?
no , it doesn' t .
but it' s a difficult question .
i sorta pieced it together over the years .
well , how did he first contact you ?
he didn' t .
i went looking for him last month , after my mother died .
she had ovarian cancer that spread to her stomach and liver .
she took her own life .
oh .
well , good night , i guess .
good night .
you mind if i stay and listen for a little while ?
okay .
do you want me to catch you up in the story ?
no .
i' il be able to figure it out .
i' il just catch as catch can .
they made these for about ... three and a half years before they terminated my sponsorship .
wow .
these are great .
may i turn this on ?
fire one .
so , what happened , in your opinion ?
what are you talking about ?
don' t you think the public perception of your work has altered in the last five years ?
that' s your first question ?
i thought this was supposed to be a puff piece .
should we come back to it ?
yeah .
okay .
is it true that this is going to be your last voyage ?
wow .
no comment .
who told you that ?
no , goddamn it .
i' m i' m only 52 .
how about we start out with some stock dialogue ?
you know , favorite color blue .
favorite food sardines .
how do you feel about part one of your new film ?
why ?
how do you feel about part one of my new film ?
well , i' m honest , so  just say it .
i thought aspects of it seemed slightly fake .
wolodarsky ?
i' il take five , steve .
how ' bout taking five ?
did it seem fake ... when my best friend was bitten in half right in front of me ... then eaten alive , screaming ?
i think you' re a fake .
and i think you' re a phony ... and a bad reporter .
how does that feel ?
now tell me something .
does this seem fake ?
how dare you ?
this entire article was my idea .
no one else gives a shit .
what about si perlman ?
are you joking ?
he' s not even covering my expenses .
you' re taking something out on me .
oh , stop crying .
what' s the deal here ?
i was only trying to defend myself .
well , you did a great job .
i' m sure you' il make a terrific father .
so , you really think you' re a zissou .
i don' t know .
well , you traveled a long way for " i don' t know , " sonny .
that' s true .
but it' s important to me .
yeah ?
well , there are a lot of things that are important to some people around here , sonny .
klaus , don' t call me " sonny .
and one more thing .
it' s the steve zissou show , not the ned show .
you hear me ?
yes , i do .
klaus !
ja ?
if you ever touch me again , i will kick your goddamn teeth out .
is that understood ?
not if i don' t see you first , sonny .
we gotta watch ourselves around this jane character .
don' t tell her anything personal .
if you' re not sure about something , change the subject ... and look for me .
this bull dyke' s got something against us .
i don' t think she' s a lesbian .
she' s pregnant .
bull dykes can get pregnant .
anyway , i' d back out now , but we need the press .
see you in the morning .
steve .
hmm ?
when' d you first hear about me ?
about five years ago .
i ... read it in an article about myself .
did you believe it ?
it was in the paper .
i assumed they checked their facts .
why didn' t you contact me ?
because i hate fathers and i never wanted to be one .
i forgot .
your correspondence stock came in .
hi , ross .
started today .
i' il forward some pages to you through the copy department .
you' re probably right , though .
what am i doing here ?
i miss you , and
oh , god , i don' t know , ross .
where are you ?
listen , i' m not leaving this message .
don' t even know why i' m still pregnant .
script girl uses these for continuity .
here .
oh , no , no , no .
no exceptions .
everyone gets one .
anne marie !
do the interns get glocks ?
no .
they all share one .
take it , ned .
steve !
what ?
whack on the echo box .
zissou here .
steve , oseary drakoulias on line two .
yeah ?
i spoke with larry amin .
and it' s a pass .
in other words , you fucked us !
let' s not cast stones at one another , my boy .
do you hear me , damn it ?
do you ?
no , i don' t !
i told you how to play it !
oh , bloody hell !
listen here , mate !
can i interrupt for a moment ?
who the blazes is that ?
it' s me , ned .
maybe this is nothing .
maybe it' s something .
i don' t know your problems .
i don' t know .
but i just inherited $275, 000 .
would that amount make any difference ?
what sort of expression is the lad wearing on his face ?
can you fly a chopper ?
i have .
i' m certainly not licensed in any way , shape or form .
great .
let' s go .
when was this whirlybird last serviced ?
i don' t know .
klaus is supposed to check it every six months .
you' re back on the water , boys .
the wire transfer came straight through from kentucky .
jackman and wordsley are going to gap finance the rest .
but we have a few hooks on it , so take a pew for a spell .
number one , the bank want a drug screen for everyone on the crew ... before they' il forward the money .
a piss test ?
yes , a piss test .
two , a stooge from the bond company ... will be riding everywhere during the whole shoot to keep you on budget .
who' s the stooge ?
a chap by the name of bill ubell .
and there' s not a damn thing you can do about that , steve .
three , you must swear legally swear that you' il not kill that shark , or whatever it is , if it actually exists .
i' m going to fight it , but i' il let it live .
what about my dynamite ?
phillip , dynamite .
i' m off to zurich .
follow me , chaps .
mr. ubell , i' d like you to know ...
steve zissou and our equity partner ned .
i hope you' re not gonna bust our chops , bill .
why would i do that ?
because you' re a bond company stooge .
i' m also a human being .
all right .
i take that back .
yeah .
let' s have some " teamsmanship .
ho !
one , two , three .
come on .
one , two , three .
attaboy .
attaboy .
here he is .
here he is .

all right .
give him some room .
he' s okay .
he just drank a little too much water .
how you shooting this , vikram ?
wide open ?
uh , light , 5 . 6 .
as always , even in the most challenging circumstances ... the members ofteam zissou find ways to keep morale high .
wait .
hold it .
is that a distress bark ?
is something wounded out there ?
we quickly locate the source of the mysterious cry .
what is she , steve ?
a wild snow mongoose .
we thought they were extinct .
her ankle' s broken .
ogata .
yeah ?
run and get some hot milk and put these guys in the incubator .
we radio for the emergency transport of our rare , beautiful new friends .
that' s what it used to be like .
had ned' s heart stopped beating before you pulled him out of the water ?
had ned' s heart stopped beating ... before we pulled him out of the water ?
yes .
but we got him started again pretty quickly .
don' t go on this voyage right now , steve .
one of you' s already dead , after all .
who ?
oh , you mean esteban ?
thanks for bringing that up .
who' s gonna tell us the latin names of all the fishes and everything ?
you know i can' t remember all that shit .
please stop , eleanor .
eleanor , stop .
why are you leaving ?
because i don' t want to be part of whatever' s gonna happen .
nobody knows what' s going to happen .
and then we film it .
that' s the whole concept .
that' s how we' ve always done it .
i can' t believe you took that boy' s money .
he' s an investor .
he' s my sidekick .
the sugar crabs are back .
they' re early this year .
i' ve never seen them mating before the solstice .
is that mating ?
good bye , steve .
don' t say that , even if it' s true .
don' t say that .
it' s too painful .
what do you want me to say ?
say bon voyage .
bon voyage .
kingsley " ned " zissou , 29 .
junior grade diving tech , executive producer .
energetic , spirited , youthful .
normally we would track the jaguar shark ... with a scanning monitor we keep on board the belafonte .
but its power tubes have seized up and blown a gasket .
we now proceed ... to an advanced system located on a colleague' s offshore facility .
this will be team zissou' s next stop .
see , renzo ?
this is what i' m talking about .
a relationship subplot .
there' s chemistry between us , you know .
huh ?
here' s a quote .
wait up .
who from ?
zissou has an almost magical connection ...
to the life of the sea .
he speaks its language fluently .
i' ve never met a boy like that in all my life .
lord mandrake .
you should have opened with that one .
he was your mentor
hey , intern ?
get me a campari , will ya ?
on the rocks ?
wanna go up in my balloon ?
i like her hairdo .
me too .
but steve called her first .
i' m sorry i made you cry the other day .
oh , that' s okay .
it' s not completely your fault , anyway .
i' m going through some personal problems .
really ?
what do you got ?
well , i' m five months pregnant .
my editor' s the father .
he' s married .
but not to me .
wow .
that' s a rough ticket .
you know , my first wife left me when i was your age .
what' s " deep search " ?
my submarine .
i had this exact image of you ... tacked up on the wall above my aquarium all through primary school .
oh , yeah ?
you mean the official photograph , where i' m doing this ?
that' s the one .
mm hmm .
well , maybe it' s just me , but i don' t feel like that person .
i never did .
here' s to you nicola and bart
rest forever here in our hearts
the last and final moment is yours
why did you abandon ned ?
i didn' t .
i never even met him .
what kind of piece are you writing , cubbie ?
are you gonna screw us on this deal ?
i hope not .
here' s to you nicola and bart
you really think it' s cool to hit the sauce when you' ve got a bun in the oven ?
pel , bring us back down , please .
is your triumph
i don' t have a problem with objective reporting .
what i have a problem with is some wombat ... coming on my boat trying to railroad me .
see if you can get one of these dolphins to swim under the hull ... and give us a look .
nah .
either they can' t hear us , or they don' t understand .
son of a bitch , i' m sick of these dolphins .
quiet out there tonight .
can you hear the jack whales singing ?
beautiful .
i wonder what they' re saying .
well , that was the sludge tanker over there , but
there you go .
that' s them .
by the way , would you mind if i made a few modifications to the team zissou insignia ?
i have some ideas  you mean the patch ?
yes .
the insignia .
yeah .
it' s probably kinda dated , isn' t it ?
sure .
take a crack at it .
make it a little trendier .
all right .
are you finding what you were looking for ... out here with me ?
i hope so .
i wrote you a letter about 17 years ago .
you mean , like , a fan letter ?
did i write you back ?
i try to answer as many personally as i can .
dear ned plimpton ...
first , in answer to your question , always .
second , thank you very much for naming your bug after me .
my wife tells me it is actually a type of gnat .
you strike me as a very special boy and a key member of the zissou society .
i wish i could come visit you in kentucky and assist you with your work .
i remember your mother .
take care of yourself , ned plimpton .
you' ve served well .
your friend , capt. steve zissou .
dictated , but not read . '
yeah , more or less standard boilerplate , i guess .
there' s some real high tech gear ... inside this deal , believe me .
first we go downstairs and turn on that tracking system .
then , as long as the batteries on that homing dart haven' t gone down
who locked us out ?
no one .
we' re trespassing .
steve , are we allowed in here ?
it' s a scientific community , man .
captain , i am required by law ... to notify the bank of any illegal activities .
just do what you' ve gotta do to cover your ass , bill .
i got it .
fuck !
they wired it !
klaus , go down and get me some cable snippers .
this is captain hennessey .
you have trespassed on a private facility .
the coast guard is being alerted via satellite .
again , this is captain hennessey .
immediately leave the prem
okay , action .
well , look who' s back in town .
you' ve traveled over 150 miles since we last heard from you .
this son of a bitch is heading for the south pacific .
turn on your tape recorder , cubbie .
is it the jaguar shark ?
on the record , yes .
cut .
print both takes , vikram .
was i ... just in the film ?
yeah .
you' re gonna have to sign a release .
but you' ve actually located the shark ?
you' d better bet your fuckin ' ass we did .
all right , everybody , we got about 25 to 30 minutes ... before the coast guard gets here to arrest us .
i want you all to get hennessey' s best gear onto the belafonte in 15 .
you' re gonna steal his stuff ?
nah , we' il get it back to him .
interns , let' s see some hustle .
uh , what is this , pel ?
i don' t know .
uh , the map ?
steve !
uh huh ?
do you know that you just charted us on a course through unprotected waters ?
yeah .
we' re taking the shortcut .
but it' s outside i. m. u. jurisdiction .
there isn' t any protection .
i know , honey .
look at the map .
we go your way , that' s about four inches .
we go my way , it' s an inch and a half .
you wanna pay for the extra gas ?
what kind of system is this ?
it' s the bernstein nines .
they just upgraded last summer .
the nines are out already ?
does this do cappuccino ?
ja .
wait a second .
steve , this isn' t the procedure .
one of the interns just fell down the stairs with the main tracking processor .
just make sure we steal the backup .
are you listening to me ?
eleanor told me that under no circumstances
shut up before you jinx us , anne marie .
you catching anything ?
mm mmm .
hook this up and make me a latte .
you know , cubbie' s kind of a sucker maker ... but she' s got some moves .
i agree .
if she wasn' t a bull dyke , i think i might have a bit of a thing for her .
as you can see ... if the creature continues its current migratory route ... our paths should converge in less than four days .
i wanna get there in three .
ogata , can we
vladimir , what' s this blip right over here ?
i don' t know .
i' ve been trying to figure that out .
we might have them both mixed up , or it could be the other way around .
but we' re gonna be right on top of it first thing in the morning .
hmm .
good eye , ned .
thank you .
should we investigate it ?
yeah .
let' s make a quick dive at 6 : 00 a . m . , and we' il scope out the phantom signal .
it' s probably just one of hennessey' s research turtles .
yes .
but i wanna be back on the road by lunch .
do me a favor .
next time you get a hot idea in front of the reporter ... whisper it in my ear first .
otherwise i look like kind of a daydream johnny .
you know ?
daydream johnny , yes .
you let him change your name ?
well , we changed it together .
what was it before ?
edward plimpton .
that' s a million times better .
change it back , ned .
i really don' t see you as a kingsley zissou .
do you think steve and i have a family resemblance ?
no .
i guess it doesn' t really matter anyway .
here .
i stole it back .
i strung it on some peppermint dental floss ... in case you wanna wear it like a necklace .
happy with the piece , jane ?
what are you doing in here ?
am i ?
no .
put that down .
i assume i' m mr. z.
i' m sorry that you think my red hat is , uh
what' s the word you use ?
contrived .
and that ...
the zissou of my childhood represents all the dreams i' ve come to regret .
what ?
why ?
i' m going to have to start locking my f ing door .
it was locked .
i kicked it in .
why don' t you just curse like other people ?
because i' m trying to get out of the habit before i have my fucking baby !
okay .
that makes sense .
well , please clean up your room anyway .
it looks like a goddamn typhoon hit it .
get out !
please don' t make fun of me .
i just wanted to flirt with you .
i' il have an intern come and fix the door .
this is a message from the i. m. u. coast guard .
apparently some crooked fuckers broke into my sea lab yesterday .
how awful .
did they nick anything ?
it doesn' t say .
they probably just trashed the place .
i' m so pissed i wanna spit .
hugo [ spits ]
tell carl to load my elephant gun ... with buckshot .
we' re gonna hunt down these sickos .
supposedly cousteau and his cronies ... invented the idea of putting walkie talkies into the helmet .
but we made ours with a special rabbit ear on the top ... so we could pipe in some music .
let' s start with the reverse .
okay , roll it , vikram .
would it be possible for me to address you as dad in this scene ?
no .
why ?
oh , excuse me .
i' m sorry .
i forgot .
i i' m sorry .
where are you coming from , jack off ?
shit .
it' s not a bad impulse though .
some kind of nickname .
not that one .
it' s too specific , but try to think of something else .
another name ?
how about stevesy ?
that' s good .
try it .
what were you gonna say before ?
good luck , stevesy .
fantastic .
let' s go .
okay , action .
look , ned .
there' s a sunken airplane down there .
let' s check it out .
we examine the crash site , but are careful not to disturb the forensic evidence .
how was that ?
not bad .
the first take was a little faster .
is that yours ?
klaus .
klaus .
ja ?
may i have a word with you , please ?
what ?
why' d you do that ?
because i owed you one .
but you gave me a warning already .
you stood up for yourself .
i still owed you one .
and now i owe you one .
no .
now we' re even .
why are you doing this ?
he' s not my father , you know .
i don' t have that .
what are you talking about ?
we' re even , " damn it .
that' s it !
no , it was like a beat up little jalopy .
i don' t know what you' d call it .
you didn' t see it ?
i didn' t see it , boss .
well , keep your eyes peeled .
klaus , check who' s on watch .
i' il be in the sauna .
pel and

piano , classical ]

mm hmm .
that' s him .
i' ve never felt a baby in someone' s stomach before .
i think you' il make a very good single mother .
thanks .
although it does put you both at a tremendous disadvantage .
you know ...
steve' s got a little bit of a thing for you .
why do you say that ?
because he told me .
really ?
i thought he hated my guts .
well , i think you hurt his feelings , but that doesn' t mean
he says i hurt his feelings ?
so ... f' d up .
five , four
three , two
yeah ?
steve , would you please open the door ?
mm hmm ?
jane , is , uh , ned in there ?

oh , my god .
you' re right .
stevesy , look .
whoa .
no .
so , tell me , you were reading to each other in french ?
no , it' s in english .
it was translated .
well , you know , you' re not supposed to go into each other' s cabins on a boat .
why not ?
it' s just kind of ... an unwritten maritime rule when you' re at sea .
especially the goddamn lookout .
i' m so sorry .
so am i.
you hung us out to dry .
if we don' t handle this right ... we' re gonna all get murdered .
including her unborn british child .

please don' t hurt him .
watch me .
i' il let you know when i' m gonna make a move .
steve , it' s way safer for us to just do what they say .
they probably just want our money and jewels and shit .
yeah .
then how am i gonna finish my movie then ?
jesus holy f
