so you want a pass through position that will keep showing the body , right ?
so where are your arms ?

looking up .
that would help ....

what you have to realize is that people are watching you all the time .

<i>arnold schwarzenegger , 28 years old ... </ i> <i>6' 2 " , 240 pounds . </ i>
<i>mr .
olympia for the past five years . </ i>
<i>he is preparing to defend his title</ i> <i>this year for the last time . </ i>
all mr. universes from the past five years or so ... get together in one contest to find out who is the best of all the mr. universes .
so they created the mr. olympia contest , which is then the top contest .
and whoever wins that is the top bodybuilder .
and you are the top bodybuilder .
right .
how long have you been the top ?
i' ve not been beaten for the last seven years .
and ...
i won the mr. olympia contest five years now .
this is now the sixth year .
they score on points ?
yeah , on points .
it' s like judging the body by muscularity , and by proportion ... symmetry , the whole thing .
do you visualize yourself as a piece of sculpture ?
yeah , definitely .
good bodybuilders have the same mind ... when it comes to sculpting , than a sculptor has .
i need more deltoids , more shoulders , " so you get the proportions right .
so what you do is you exercise ... and put those deltoids on .
whereas an artist would just slap on some clay on each side .
does it , maybe , the easier way .
we go through a harder way ... because you have to do it on a human body .
i mean , obviously a lot of people look at you ... and they think it' s kind of strange , what you' re doing .
but those are the people who don' t know much about it .
as soon as you find out what the whole thing is about ... then it' s just like another thing .
it' s not any stranger as going into a car ... and trying to go in a quarter mile , five seconds .
i mean , that' s , for me , strange .
<i>the greatest feeling you can get in a gym ... </ i> <i>or the most satisfying feeling</ i> <i>you can get in a gym , is the pump . </ i>
<i>let' s say you train your biceps . </ i>
<i>blood is rushing into your muscles, </ i> <i>and that' s what we call the pump . </ i>
<i>your muscles get a really tight feeling ... </ i>
<i>like your skin is going to explode</ i> <i>any minute . </ i>
<i>it' s really tight , it' s like somebody</ i> <i>blowing air into your muscle . </ i>
<i>it just blows up and it feels different . </ i>
<i>it feels fantastic . </ i>
<i>it' s as satisfying to me as coming is . </ i>
<i>as having sex with a woman and coming . </ i>
<i>so can you believe</ i> <i>how much i' m in heaven ? </ i>
i' m getting the feeling of coming in the gym .
i' m getting the feeling of coming at home .
i' m getting the feeling of coming backstage when i pump up ... when i pose out in front of 5, 000 people , i get the same feeling .
i' m coming day and night .
i mean it' s terrific , right ?
so , you know , i' m in heaven .
all right , got to do that .
this girl maybe didn' t have a kiss for years .
i may as well give her a break .

come over here and i' il give you your kiss .
yes , i got this pose .
he' s got a beautiful body , man .
first time i ever seen somebody' s arms 23 inches .
he' s a big dude , all the way big dude .
<i>i started reading about gaining weight</ i> <i>and weightlifting in some magazines . </ i>
<i>and i saw arnold' s picture . </ i>
<i>and when i saw him from all those angles ... </ i> <i>every angle those shots were taken from, </ i> <i>he looked good . </ i>
<i>and i said , " that' s the way i wanna look . " </ i>
my father' s real tall and i' m short , so at least ... if i can' t get as tall as he is , i wanna be as wide as he was . if i can' t get as tall as he is , i wanna be as wide as he was .
make one line .
try to make one line straight .
so you always remember that you have to have a line .
yeah , see now there' s your line .
and look where you point .
yeah .
great .
i like what you had in <i>ironman</ i> .
yeah , that' s good .
again , raise up the hand .
remember one thing , when you pose ... a lot of little guys have one habit .
and they hide away when they pose .
when they do an arm pose , they do like this .
the big guy will come right out with his arm .
never do that , never hide away .
like right now , you did like this .
you know , show them .
show them the whole thing .
make the move , open up the whole body .
do the same thing again .
yeah , great .
look confident , yeah .

<i>i was doing very well with the jets</ i> <i>until i got injured . </ i>

<i>when i went to the mr. universe</ i> <i>contest in ' 72 ... </ i> <i>and in ' 73 and in ' 7 4 ... </ i>
<i>i knew , even though</ i> <i>i didn' t win the contest ... </ i> <i>when i go to south africa this year, </ i> <i>i' m sure the same thing is gonna happen . </ i>
<i>the crowd is gonna be for me . </ i>
<i>the contests in south africa , in pretoria ... </ i> are the most important or prestigious amateur contests in the world ... the lfbb mr. universe contest ... which is amateur , open to amateur athletes .
sort of along the guidelines of the olympics .
and the other contest is a professional contest ... open to professionals , because there' s money prizes involved ... and that' s called the mr. olympia .
so i' il be competing in the mr. universe , since i am an amateur .
and ... as i see it , from all of the people who i know who are gonna be there ... and the best in the world will be there ...
i feel it' s gonna be between me and ken waller ... for the overall championship .
i told you boys , i' m the quarterback .
i don' t worry about mike katz , anyway .
the only one guy i worry about is robbie .
he' s good , but he lacks too many things .
his arms aren' t big enough to match his chest .
his thighs are too big for his calves .
he hits one pose .
ln that , he looks like a big spider .
what i' m gonna do when i get to africa ?
i' m gonna take katz' s shirt and hide it .
i' m gonna take everything i can find of his and hide it .

<i>my parents in the beginning, </ i> <i>when i started bodybuilding ... </ i> <i>they didn' t know really what it is ... </ i> <i>until i introduced my father</ i> <i>to bodybuilding ... </ i> <i>and i took him to all the gymnasiums . </ i>
<i>and he then started picking up weights, </ i> <i>and making his arms strong and so on . </ i>
and then they started liking what i did .
especially after i won the first international competition ... <i>which was the first contest i ever entered ... </ i> <i>the junior mr. europe in stuttgart , germany . </ i>
<i>so when i came home with my trophy, </ i> <i>my parents were very proud of me ... </ i> <i>and they said , " my son , that' s my son . " </ i>
<i>my father was a police chief in austria ... </ i> <i>in a town called graz . </ i>
<i>we had a very strict upbringing</ i> <i>because of him being with the police force . </ i>
<i>we had to be the perfect example . </ i>
<i>we couldn' t do anything bad . </ i>
<i>and it was kind of an uptight</ i> <i>feeling at home because of it . </ i>
<i>i always felt like my place is america . </ i>

i dreamt about arnold last night .
really ?
i told him , " arnold , you' re making a big mistake going to africa .
he says , " why do you say that , mr. ferrigno ?
i said , " louie is waiting for you , in the shadows .
<i>lou ferrigno , 24 years old, </ i> <i>a former sheet metal worker . </ i>
<i>mr .
america , and twice mr. universe . </ i>
<i>he' s turned professional this year, </ i> <i>and is a contender for the mr. olympia title . </ i>
<i>lou lives with his parents</ i> <i>in brooklyn , new york . </ i>
<i>at 6' 5 " and 275 pounds ... </ i>
<i>lou is the largest bodybuilder ever . </ i>
<i>and he thinks he can take the title</ i> <i>from arnold this year . </ i>
<i>so does his father , matty ... </ i> <i>who retired from the new york city police</ i> <i>department to oversee lou' s training . </ i>
<i>the first time arnold came to america, </ i> <i>i took louie backstage . </ i>
<i>and when arnold went by us, </ i> <i>i' il never forget ... </ i>
<i>i looked at louie' s face, </ i> <i>and he just looked at arnold with awe . </ i>
<i>i thought god just passed us . </ i>
<i>and i looked at louie , i said, </ i> <i>" what do you think , louie ? " </ i>
<i>and he looked at me, </ i> <i>he said , " gee , dad , he' s big . " </ i>
<i>and i would say that from that moment on</ i> <i>when he first saw arnold ... </ i> <i>he wanted to be mr. olympia . </ i>
<i>it was in his eye , in his heart, </ i> <i>and in his mind . </ i>
<i>and it became part of his entire body . </ i>

<i>louie was only an infant in the crib, </ i> <i>and he developed this ear infection . </ i>
<i>we didn' t know it at the time ... </ i> <i>until louie was about three years old, </ i> <i>we found out that he was hard of hearing . </ i>
<i>that' s why he never took</ i> <i>an interest in things ... </ i> <i>other kids would take an interest in, </ i> <i>like television . </ i>
<i>he was late</ i> <i>learning to speak and everything . </ i>
<i>louie would become a lip reader . </ i>
<i>louie was a real skinny kid . </ i>
<i>he couldn' t make the football team</ i> <i>because he was too skinny . </ i>
<i>then he started to buy</ i> muscle magazine .
<i>i remember i would take him</ i> <i>to a bookstore ... </ i> <i>and he would buy up all</ i> <i>the old muscle books . </ i>
<i>and he would read for hours .
i remember ... </ i> <i>2 . : 00 , 3 . : 00 in the morning, </ i> <i>i would find his light on ... </ i> <i>and he would be reading the muscle books . </ i>
<i>so louie decided</ i> <i>to do a little bodybuilding . </ i>
<i>i had an old weightlifting set in the cellar . </ i>
<i>i used to do a little bit of it myself . </ i>
<i>never knowing at that time that someday ... </ i>
<i>louie would be on the stage against arnold, </ i> <i>in pretoria , south africa . </ i>
you just keep after him .
wherever he goes , you pose down with him , right next to him .
let the judges make a comparison .
you' re 6' 5 " .
you' il be the biggest thing that ever went out on that platform , at 275 pounds .
they know that , and he knows it .
this is for the big baby , louie .
this is for all the marbles .
and we' re gonna go after it , right ?
one year of training , all wrapped up in one night , louie , remember that .
when you step out there , boy ... remember all those grueling nights and mornings in the gym .
and this is it , this is the reward .
and we want it .
we want it so bad that we can taste it .
remember that when we' re on that stage .
we gotta get so excited , when we' re there we have only one thought in mind .
that' s the olympia , we' il win .
how long is arnold sleeping ?
he' s been here for a couple days now .
yeah , a couple days ?
the reason why i woke you up was because ...
i am gonna go to new york tonight .
i did wanna say goodbye .
and i' m gonna see ferrigno there .
we' re gonna train for two , three weeks .
and everything ... that i learned from you ... that you stole from me , i' m gonna give him .
i figure the combination' s gonna be very hard to beat , arnold , very hard .
i' il see you when you get back .
what should i tell louie when i get to new york ?
i mean , i am gonna train with him for a few days .
tell louie ...
that i said hi .
yeah ?
say to his father that i said hi .
and i' m looking forward to seeing him in south africa .
okay ?
all right .
ln other words , you want me to be very nice .
be very nice to him .
okay .
because he needs a lot of help .
see , the king of the hill can only go down .
that' s right .
the king of the hill can only go down .
or stay up .
or stay on that hill .
right .
that' s the other possibility .
but the wolf on the hill
the wolf on the hill , right ... is not as hungry as the wolf climbing the hill .
that' s true , he' s not as hungry .
but when he wants the food , it' s there .
biceps , the back , trapezius another thing .
also , in fact , this evening i' m gonna jog about a mile and a half , two miles .

<i>the body that isn' t used to</ i> <i>maybe the ninth , tenth ... </ i> <i>eleventh , and twelfth rep</ i> <i>with a certain weight . </ i>
<i>so that makes the body grow , then . </ i>
<i>going through this pain barrier . </ i>
experiencing pain in your muscles and aching ... and just go on and go on .
and this last two or three or four repetitions ... that' s what makes the muscle then grow .
and that divides one from a champion and one from not being a champion .
lf you can go through this pain barrier , you may get to be a champion .
lf you can' t go through , forget it .
and that' s what most people lack , is having the guts .
the guts to go in and just say , " i' il go through and i don' t care what happens .
it aches , and if i fall down ....
i have no fear of fainting in a gym ... because i know it could happen .
i threw up many times while i was working out .
but it doesn' t matter , because it' s all worth it .

<i>ladies and gentlemen ... </ i> <i>the strongest man in the world</ i> <i>is blowing up a hot water bottle . </ i>
<i>that takes 600 pounds of pressure . </ i>
it' s gonna pop .
okay , franco .
lazy bastards .
look .
i missed it .
okay .
<i>i met arnold in germany . </ i>
<i>he came to united states, </ i> <i>i came to united states , also . </ i>
<i>we went through many things together . </ i>
<i>and now , i will be competing</ i> <i>in the mr. olympia with arnold . </ i>
<i>of course , i think i' m gonna win . </ i>
<i>i have more definition ... </ i> <i>and i' m more muscular . </ i>
<i>but arnold' s taller than me, </ i> <i>and that can be one advantage for him . </ i>
i think i can show the best out there .
the only problem now is matter of the judges ' opinion , too .
you never really know what' s going to happen .
okay , louie .
no , listen .
when you come out here and you' re out here ....
right ?
they' re all waiting for you , louie .
they wanna see what you got , they' ve never seen you before .
you tense your legs , right ?
then you look at the crowd .
they' re all looking at you .
flashbulbs going off and all .
then you put your arms like this .
you look at your arms like you' re admiring , right ?
you' re admiring what you' re gonna show them .
and then you go ....
boom !
take a look at this hunk of man .
something like that .
you try it now .
look up , that' s right .
that' s it .
no , down here , louie .
i told you , look at your arms down here .
look at both arms .
both arms ?
right .
that' s it .
atta boy .
now hold that pose .
because remember , your arms are bigger than arnold' s .
they wanna see them , right ?
they have never seen your arms .
they' ve seen arnold' s .
so hold that pose a while .
and i say , this pose , just tilt your body a little ... because people on this side of the theater ... and people on this side wanna see you .
so tilt your body just slightly like this .
try that , lou .
atta boy .
<i>you have to do everything possible to win . </ i>
<i>you know , no matter what . </ i>
the day of the contest , if he comes in his best shape ... and he' s equally as good as i am ... or if , let' s say , he' s a few percent better than i am ...
i spend with him one night .
i go downstairs and book us together in a room ... to help him for tomorrow' s contest .
and ... that night ... he will never forget .
i will mix him up .
he will come so ready to south africa , so strong .
but by the time the night is over , the next morning ... he will be ready to lose .
i mean i will just talk him into that , it' s no problem to do .
so , all those things are available .
and if they' re available , you might as well use them .
so it doesn' t matter if he comes in shape , or out of shape .
lf he comes out of shape , at least it' s less hassle for me .
and if he' s in shape ....
fine , i hope he is .
but you couldn' t pull this with franco .
franco' s pretty smart .
franco is pretty smart , but franco is a child .
when it comes to the day of the contest , i' m his father .
he comes to me for advices .
so , it' s not that hard for me to give him ... the wrong advices .
<i>pretoria , south africa . </ i>
probably in an hour or two , we have a chance to see our room .
10 minutes .
i promise .
can i just ask you one question ?
the usual we ask .
what must your ... special woman look like ?
it really doesn' t matter .
i like them with black hair , with brown hair , with red hair .
with big breasts , with little breasts , with big ass , with a little ass .
lf the personality is great and if they' re charming ....
wonderful , nothing to do , just lay out in the sunshine .
can' t wait to get into the sun .
look at that sun out there .
we ordered it for you .
watch out now , lou .
this is good .
get ready .
holy cow .
he likes the oil .
hold it up , that a boy , lou .
tense your muscles , louie .
pull in your stomach .
sometimes when people ask you advice ... if you think that they' re being arrogant , or misusing the sport of bodybuilding ... you give them kind of pranksterish advice .
and that' s once happened in a mr. munich contest , i believe .
i want to win mr. munich .
i am a perfect poser ...
and i have a fantastic body .
and i just want to learn a new posing routine , a new style .
something way out which nobody expects .
so i said , " let me see your posing routine you have right now .
when the guy took his clothes off and posed for me ... he looked like nothing , number one , and his posing was bad .
so i mean , he was just ....
i think he was crazy .
so i thought , okay , if he thinks that he' s the best poser ...
i' m gonna pull a little trick on him .
and so that' s what i did .
i said , " listen , i have a new posing routine from america .
i' m in correspondence with all the top athletes in america . " and so on .
and i told him that the new thing is ... that he has to scream while he' s posing .
and he looked at me and he says ...
that' s a new idea .
that will really come out impressive .
when you go out on stage and scream , people can' t miss you .
they' il all look at you screaming , that' s it .
so i taught him how to scream .
first of all , i oiled him up .
his body , with really heavy oil and everything .
we' re standing there in the shower room .
and i taught him how to do it .
the higher your arms go up , the higher you make a screaming noise .
and the lower your arms come down , the lower the noise .
this kind of a thing .
i practiced with him for around two hours .
spent a lot of time on developing his new posing routine .
and he mastered it very well .
he was screaming really loud and high and low .
and he went to the mr. munich contest .
i told him when he walks out , he has to scream loud , run out .
and so he did .
and obviously people weren' t ready for that at all .
and so , he went out there , screamed loud .
went through three or four poses with loud screaming .
they carried him off the stage and threw him out .
they thought the guy was totally nuts .
i' m shaking , really .
but when i get there , i think i' il forget about it .
forget about it ?
yeah .
when i get there , i' m even more nervous .
i' m not nervous at all .
thank you .
jesus christ .
take it easy .
what can i say ?
you guys are psyching me out here early in the morning .
the only way to do it .
lay down in the bus in the back .
hey , lou . ls this the master plan here this morning ?
right , be on guard .
i' m here now for six days and nobody invited me for breakfast .
this morning they say , " come for breakfast with us , arnold , have a nice breakfast .
he' s talking about pumping up .
he' s talking about psyching me out .
she' s talking about my mother .
you' re the king of kings , arnold .
shit .
he' s rubbing it in .
how are you doing , lou ?
how you doing ?
good .
look kind of worried today .
just a little tired , gotta wake up .
they don' t come nicer than you , arnold .
i' m a nice guy .
i wouldn' t turn my back on you , arnold , within 500 yards .
you don' t trust me , why' s that ?
they should have the olympia early on so we could relax , enjoy the country .
they should have it in a month for him .
he isn' t even in shape yet .
he didn' t get the timing right , i' m telling you .
a month from now would have been perfect for you .
but then i' d get bigger , too , again ... so doesn' t matter , what the hell .
let' s get it over with .
and if you retire this year , you just never had the olympia .
but you had twice the universe , what the hell .
that' s not too bad , either .
you could go on and win the next five years .
it' s amazing .
can you imagine the feeling i have ?
six times mr. olympia .
i told you , you' ve found the fountain of youth .
you could go on forever .
it blows my mind when i think about it .
people are so tired
i called my mother yesterday already and i said , " i won .
she says , " congratulations , arnold .
anyway , listen , guys , why don' t we go ?
you go and help him pump up .
calm him down , help him .
okay ?
don' t screw him up this time .
i don' t want you in our pumping room .
<i>judges . </ i>
<i>final attention, </ i> <i>you all understand our strict code and rule . </ i>
<i>no talking whilst adjudicating . </ i>
and that also means , photographers , please do not speak to the judges .
i' il simply will have to remove ....
<i>most of the judging at an international</ i> <i>competition takes place during the day ... </ i> <i>before the crowds and distractions</ i> <i>of the nighttime show . </ i>
<i>this is called the prejudging . </ i>
double biceps , rear .
<i>the judges look for three things . : </ i> <i>symmetry , proportion and the size</ i> <i>and clarity of each muscle group . </ i>
<i>olympia contestants</ i> <i>are judged in two classes . </ i>
<i>those over 200 pounds and those under . </ i>
<i>at night , the two class winners</ i> <i>will pose off for the overall title . </ i>
<i>each class poses first as a group, </ i> <i>for comparison judging . </ i>
<i>then they come on one at a time</ i> <i>to perform the six compulsory poses ... </ i> <i>that show every part of the body . </ i>
he' s so crazy .
what a monster .
oh , my god .
these guys are like animals , man .
i can' t believe it .
look at this one now .
see , this is the hard part right here , look at that .
and your lats from the rear .
what' s he got ?
let' s see .
you can call him " the bat " from now on .
" franco the bat .
he could fly with that .
finish with the left side chest ... and your optional routine .
nice shot , goddamn it .
that guy ....
it gives you chills when you watch that guy .
i know . lsn' t it unbelievable ?
look .
<i>ed corney , a 44 year old nightclub owner</ i> <i>originally from hawaii . </ i>
<i>he is franco' s chief competition</ i> <i>in the under 200 pound class . </ i>
can you believe that ?
i mean , that' s what i call posing .
okay , turn to your right , serge , face that way .
turn right on .
look straight ahead .
that' s it .
that' s the position we want .
<i>an unexpected entry</ i> <i>in the tall class of the olympia contest . </ i>
<i>serge nubret , 4 1 years old . </ i>
<i>six feet , 200 pounds . </ i>
<i>mr .
france, </ i> <i>and a movie and television star in europe . </ i>
don' t lean back too much , you get wrinkles in the back .
don' t go back too much .
all right .
okay , thank you .
your back was out of sight .
your back , fantastic .
do i need more arm ?
louie , you should' ve did this one for your arms .
they called it .
i didn' t wanna look small .
you mean this one ?
no .
you' re wrong .
okay .
look , looks like nothing .
the arms are important .
you' ve got arms , and he' s got spaghetti arms , louie .
<i>i don' t have any weak points . </ i>
<i>i had weak points a few years ago . </ i>
<i>but my main thing in mind is .... </ i>
<i>my goal always was to even out everything ... </ i> <i>to the point that everything is perfect . </ i>
<i>which means if i want to increase</ i> <i>one muscle a half inch ... </ i> <i>the rest of the body has to increase . </ i>
<i>i would never just</ i> <i>make one muscle increase or decrease . </ i>
<i>because everything fits together now . </ i>
<i>and all i have to do now is get</ i> <i>my posing routine down more perfect ... </ i> <i>which is almost impossible to do . </ i>
<i>it' s perfect already . </ i>
yeah , it' s down to a point .
wait when you see it .
relax .
thank you , arnold .
lf you want to be a champion ... you cannot have any kind of an outside negative force coming in and affect you .
let' s say before a contest , if i get emotionally involved with a girl ... that can have a negative effect on my mind ... and therefore destroy my workout .
so i have to cut my emotions off ... and be kind of cold , in a way , before a competition .
that' s what you do with the rest of the things .
lf somebody steals my car outside of my door right now ...
i don' t care .
i can' t be bothered with that .
i would only have my secretary call the insurance agency and laugh about it .
because i cannot be bothered with it .
i trained myself for that .
to be totally cold and not have things go into my mind .
and it was , in a way , a sad story ... when my father died .
your dad died .
and this was exactly two months before a contest .
she says , " you come home to the funeral ?
i said , " no .
it' s too late , he' s dead , there' s nothing to be done .
and i' m sorry , i can' t come .
and i didn' t explain to her really the reasons why .
i had other excuses to her , because how do you explain a mother ... whose husband died , you know , your trip ?
i didn' t bother with it .
and that actually caused one of the greatest conflicts ... with my girlfriend .
it doesn' t bother you ?
i mean , your father died .
i never talk about it again .
<i>the finals of the mr. olympia contest . </ i>
<i>first to be judged</ i> <i>is the under 200 pound class . </ i>

yeah .

what did you say , louie ?
what did you say ?
i' m training , arnold .
gotta get a good pump .
you make too much noise .
supposed to be very quiet here , like in a church .
tell him .
i can take you .
keep looking .
thanks a lot .
you' ve got a better neck .
i know .
i watch you .
i watch you , too .
there' s a barbell above my head , i better watch it here .
okay .
we don' t want no accidents here .
what symmetry you' ve got .
you look like something michelangelo cut out .
more oil , more .
that' s not good oil .
lou , relax .

we are ready .
