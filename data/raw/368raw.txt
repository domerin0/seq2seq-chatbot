billy , what do you know about special agent harrison james ?
he was supposed to deliver some information to us
which we were then to relay to washington , but he never showed .
special agent james has been with the clb over twelve years .
he has been extremely loyal and extremely effective .
all contact with him has been through telecommunications .
his identity has been classified due to the nature of his assignment .
and the nature is ?
are you familiar with the name charles van adder .
yes .
supposedly the head of an internal spy ring .
a domestic organization , i believe .
we believe he is gathering classified government information
and selling it to the highest bidders .
special agent dexter ...
i am quite aware that you are responsible for shutting down
two ofthe biggest crime families in this city .
thank you for being so ... aware , sir .
even more impressive is you did so at such a young age .
however , much less inspiring are your achievements since your promotion .
you spend more time womanizing than giving a shit about national security .
some would call you a drunk .
we need you back one hundred per cent .
we need someone who knows the mob .
we' re afraid van adder has united the families your team shut down ,
and now they' re working against the government .
special agent james has compiled information on one of these .
identities ofvan adder informants , which would allow us to shut him down .
practically overnight .
why me ?
why here in chicago ?
special agent james was going to deliver the file to us here in chicago .
but he didn' t .
why not ?
we don' t know .
do we think he' s been killed ?
we don' t know .
the bureau does not like not knowing things .
dead or alive , james is in the area and van adder is on to him .
find special agent james and his file before van adder does .
you find him before the bureau does .
his woman has hired a detective .
he goes by the name flash .
see what he knows .
any problems ... deal with them .
goodbye , carlos .
i can' t make it here without carlos .
i need you , kelly .
i miss you .
i miss you .
but i don' t like what you do , boomer .
i don' t like that city and i' m never going back there .
i' m leaving chicago , kell .
i want to come up there and be with you .
i want to make it work this time .
i want to make it work what are you saying ?
i quit the department .
i' m done .
for good .
boomer , are you coming up here because you hate that city ?
or because you love me ?
i love you , kelly .
and i' il prove it to you ifyou give me one more chance .
just listen to me .
take care of everything you have to take care of down there .
and then get up here as fast as you can .

on many occasions i' ve been the cat to make the shit come around .
what' s the word , coop ?
it wasn' t harrison james .
the report says that the dental work belongs to a 45 year old tobacco chewer .
deputy warner , did you actually ...
sheriff warner , did you see agent james ?
first of all , who did we torch ?
you brain surgeons can figure that out .
where is special agent james now ?
if he' s still in kurker county , we' il find him .
do me a favour , would you , reg ?
this time try not to light him on fire .
i currently have two unidentified bodies at the food mart .
a dead sheriff and a young lady .
and your man is responsible .
we' re talking about a federal agent .
i don' t care if he' s an astronaut .
come shit or shinola , ifwe find him , we just might torch the bastard again .
can we talk somewhere ?
don' t you ever give me one of your captain kangaroo speeches again .
don' t get righteous because you have two dead bodies in your backyard .
some civilians got killed , yes .
that' s the little picture .
the big picture is called national fucking security .
can you say that ?
national fucking security .
that' s right .
look , if special agent james is in this area , we must find him .
says here there was quite a shoot ' em up over in pine cove .
says a sheriffwas killed .
also says here a pretty young lady got shot up pretty badly .
six , seven times .
you know anything about that ?
you had something to do with this ?
i' m innocent .
well , it isn' t my job to judge you .
but you' ve got to clear out of here tomorrow morning first thing .
deputy ray warner , please .
it was in your pants pocket .
i know .
now , you' ve got some bread , you' ve got some clean clothes .
would you like to take this along for guidance ?
i' il feel better if you take this along .
for guidance .
go !

bedroom' s clear .
clear out here too .
shit .
okay , bring her here .
make double sure you' ve got no shadows .
nobody shadows tex .
all right , looks like me and you are going for a little ride , sweet tits .
who the fuck are you ?
i said , who the fuck are you ?
i' m harry james .
that' s him , right there .
harry jim .
is it really you , harry ?
i' m afraid so .
bullshit .
i don' t know who you are , man , but you' re not harry jim .
us blind fothermuckers have bullshit radar built in .
i need some information from you .
you do ?
you give me one reason why i shouldn' t blow your head off .
sockcucker .
tex , please tell me you frisked him .
i took a gun off him .
now you give me one good reason why i shouldn' t blow your head off .
cocksucker .
whatever you' re reaching for had better be a sandwich .
because you' re going to eat it .
what do you know about harry jim , you little fat fuck ?
he left messages .
i have the tapes .
then play them .
rifkin , pick up .
rifkin ...
i' m bad , man .
they got me bad .
i' m going to ...
canyon .
the old rendezvous .
i' ve got it on me .
what the fuck ?
look way south ...
then go west , past joliette .
see it ?
yeah , i see it .
why haven' t you sent someone out there ?
i don' t give a shit anymore .
we' ve got company .
bring it on , sockcuckers .
clb , the building' s surrounded .
we' re not here to fight .
we' re here to help .
fuck you .
killing a sheriff is a serious crime .
i could turn it into a parking ticket .
i need to know what you learned from rifkin .
i need to find special agent james , and i need your help .
i really don' t feel like helping anybody right now .
i knowwhat happened up in pine cove .
i knowwhat happened to your friend in that hotel room .
i' m sorry , kid .
really , i am .
i' ve had two wives .
i lost them both because of this job .
one left me , the other one was taken away .
when this is all over , we can play spanish violins for each other ,
but until then , why don' t you do something about it ?
i' m betting van adder' s following me right now .
i' il help you find harry ,
but ifyou and your boys tag along , he' s never going to show his face .
but ifyou stay back in the shadows ,  he just might move in for the kill , letting us snag harry , the file  and van adder .
i' m sorry for what i said about harry .
calling him a bastard .
don' t worry , he was .
he was a bastard .
any other man could go to hell , but he' s the father of my son .
for that , he gets a second chance .
if he' s still alive .
life' s a bitch , isn' t it ?
look who' s not dead yet .
i' d kill him right now .
before you kill anyone , you should know you' re surrounded by federal agents .
yeah , right .
yes ?
just what i wanted to hear .
i' m sorry .
laslov , did you find the file ?
the case is right there .
miles ?
where is the file ?
we haven' t touched a thing .
make sure it' s not on him .
great .
maybe it wasn' t in the case .
no , laslov !
he had it in his case when he met me at the rock quarry .
what did you do with it ?
you were in here long enough to do something with it .
where is it ?
it' s nowhere on him .
start talking .
get this thing out of here .
what do you know , boomer ?
what did you do with the file ?
just start talking , please .
i didn' t touch anything .
now you can keep screaming or start talking .
the choice is yours .
regular or unleaded ?
