i got a thing .
it led to a metal footlocker at the bottom of adam' s closet , which was , you know , already unlocked .
lnside , i found a videocassette recorder .

sorry .
wingman !
wingman !
ugh !
wuh .
oh !
ohh !
aaah !
ohhhh !
don' t tell leah , but sometimes i think that life would be a lot easier if i just looked like one of those tri pis .
i mean , do you know what it feels like to be a constant butt of jokes ?
i do .
do you know what it feels like to be called a freak , to be humiliated day in , day out until your self esteem is so low , you' d you' d walk a mile out of your way just to avoid looking in a mirror ?
or to be . . . peer pressured into crushing hundreds of cans of beer on your head for nine years . . . despite the constant migraines and the expensive c a t scans ?
roberta . . .
we love you .
ohh ...
my giant .
my gentle giant .
i feel like ... you girls are my best friends in the whole world .

so so why do they call it a gravity bong ?
i have no idea .
oh , that tickles .
stop that now .
stop it .
did you leave a boyfriend or anything back in minnesota ?
oh , no , no .
my father didn' t want me to date boys .
oh .
sounds really controlling .
he is .
he expects me to graduate , buy a house in the suburbs , and be part of his old boy network .
that' s really . . . strange .
well , uh . . .
daisy , i think you deserve better than that .
i mean , the only way you' re ever gonna be happy is if you' re true to what you want .
your dad' s just gonna have to accept that you have to make your own choices in life .
you know , you' re right .
you are .
god !
do you hear that ?
i' m so sick of those stupid frats and their stupid music !
oh , oh , oh your toes .
