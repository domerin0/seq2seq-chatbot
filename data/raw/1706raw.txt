who was that on the phone ?
eh ?
it was some guy from the community centre .
he wants to get some coaches for the kids ' soccer league .
are you gonna do it ?
maybe next year , if things calm down at work a little .
that' s what you said last year .
you want to rub some lotion on my back ?
maybe later .
i don' t want to get all these papers greasy .
alan , we have to be consistent .
successive approximations to the goal , remember ?
god , that language just turns me on .
ok , if you don' t want to do it , you don' t have to .
i do .
i do want to do it .
it' s just that book .
you know , it zaps all the spontaneity .
the point is , to get the spontaneity back .
obviously we' re not there yet .
look ,
i want this as much as you do .
i want to get things back .
no , i don' t want to get things back .
i want to make it better .
better than it' s ever been .
so ... ... let' s get to work .
excuse me , where did you get that ?
this guy i work with at the museum .
we haven' t gotten stoned since college .
mm hm .
and it was the best sex we ever had .
what about the kids ?
they' re sound asleep .
don' t answer that .
it might be my morning meeting .
hello ?
oh , sure .
hold on .
it' s for you .
do you want me to take a message ?
i' d better see who it is .
here she is .
hello .
oh , hi .
oh , no .
that' s ok .
yeah , i have the keys .
why ?
marnie , you know , we' re sure gonna miss you .
here you go .
so , alan ...
marnie and i were just calculating your chances of beating me out of this vp slot .
what do you think ?
slim or none ?
with your warmth and charm , none .
yeah not to mention the quarter i just had
bottom line says it all , pal .
oh , excuse me .
gee , i' m gonna miss neil .
i really will miss you .
that' s not exactly what i meant .
i mean , um ...
you got the wrong impression .
listen ,
wendy and i have been married for 12 years .
you' ve been flirting with me all week .
that' s not it exactly .
i find you very attractive .
so , do you want to come home with me ?
hey , wake up .
hey .
you' re home .
yeah .
what time is it ?
it' s late .
we need to talk .
what' s wrong ?
i lied to you .
there was no business dinner .
you remember that temp i was telling you about marnie ?
verna' s replacement .
i was at her apartment tonight .
just tell me .
it was like i was someone else .
she kissed me .
we kissed .
it was wonderful .
i' d be lying if i said it wasn' t .
then it all just hit me .
it was like you and brooke and daniel and the house and ... our whole lives together ...
it was like you were all in the room with me .
and you made me realise what i was doing .
i left .
i' ve just been driving around .
look ...
my point is , our marriage means more to me than i ever thought .
it' s everything , and we' ve got to do something .
we got to ...
anything .
we' ve got to fix it .
i don' t want to lose you , and i don' t want to lose the kids .
i couldn' t handle that .
you' re not alone in this , you know .
what do you mean ?
remember the pancake house where we used to take the kids last summer ?
the waiter there ryan .
sandy hair , mid twenties .
what , you had an affair with him ?
no ... ... but i thought about it .
a lot .
whenever i made love with you ,
i fantasised about him .
really ?
both times ?
it' s not funny , alan .
i know .
oh .
i know .
i started going for lunch alone there because i wanted him all to myself .
that' s not the way it should be .
i don' t want parts of my life that i can' t share with you .
do you think the car will be ok ?
it' il be fine .
don' t worry .
we have not been down here in so long .
we got some time to kill before we pick up the kids .
i thought it would be fun .
we should find a thrift store and buy the kids a costume .
ah , what luck !
costumes .
yeah !
that' s not exactly what i had in mind .
come on , take a chance .
live dangerous .
honey .
so what ?
she hasn' t had two kids .
what do you suppose this is ?
the super v 19 auto flagellator , guaranteed to give you years and years of erotic pleasure .
ok .
let' s go .
thank you .
thanks .
what did you buy ?
a swingers ' magazine ?
are you kidding ?
they' re all normal people .
they' re non pros .
they' re like us .
can you imagine soliciting total strangers ?
you' re right .
i' il take it back .
um ... wait .
couldn' t hurt to look .
come on .
daniel .
come on .
you know that thing we were talking about before ?
you did hide it ?
i did .
don' t worry .
is it my birthday present ?
you know ... i wasn' t serious .
i have to admit , though , it is an intriguing thought .
cos it' s my birthday in two weeks , you know .
oh ?
is that a fact ?
oh , i completely forgot .
come on , we' re down to the ts .
we don' t have a single prospect .
keep going .
the travises .
bill' s always undressing you mentally on the tennis court .
i like them too much .
i don' t want to risk the friendship .
do you want to do it with people we hate ?
how could i possibly face her at work the next day ?
easy .
you just say , " hi , becky , you were incredible last night !
keep going .
ok .
no .
oh , the wakefields .
you' re kidding !
that' s everybody ?
that' s everybody .
i had the good sense to leave out family members and the bradleys , with neil' s winning personality .
you two compete in enough areas enough already enough .
well , that' s it , then .
we don' t know a single person we can do it with , and it' s too scary calling up strangers .
well , still , it was fun fantasising .
you know ... ... we could make up our own ad .
hm ?
we' d be in total control .
we could get a po box and we could screen all the mail .
you can' t be serious .
i could be .
if you are .
no , no .
we' re not using a picture in this ad .
yeah , but we' il need one eventually .
ha !
this one .
couldn' t you find one without the kids ?
we' il just cut ' em out .
just like that ?
just like that .
ok .
how about this ?
curious but yellow ?
so are we .
happy but restless suburbanites ...
... seek twin sparks to rekindle flame .
dirty minds , meticulously clean bodies .
expect the same with you or no go .
what do you think ?
they sound perfect .
you check on the kids ?
they' re fine .
still doing homework .
anything interesting yet ?
these are the rejects .
what' s this ?
this is my rubber butt plug .
oh !
that killed it for me , too .
what about these two ?
they' re gorgeous .
they are .
they' re both men .
jesus !
oh , this is cute .
sorry about the out of season' s greetings , but we' re fresh out of centrefolds .
you two sound just wonderful .
send us a picture , give us a call .
let' s explore the possibilities .
love and kisses , jack and louise .
keeper .
hi , who' s calling ?
hi , this is alan .
this is alan .
this is jack .
this is jack .
hi , look , i' m not sure if we' re supposed to use last names .
whatever you feel comfortable with , al .
did you get the picture ?
yes we did .
and , to be perfectly honest , i haven' t seen louise this excited in a long time .
it' s a good thing i' m not the jealous type .
listen , wendy and i , we' ve never done anything like this before .
i assume you have .
just a few times .
so would tomorrow night be ok for you ?
tomorrow ?
neil bradley' s already made his presentation .
the client is looking at his watch .
i' m talking to a client .
is that paul mcgrew ?
no .
how do you ever find anything in this mess ?
so , who' s neil bradley ?
some prick i work with .
uh huh .
and who' s paul mcgrew ?
what , are you writing a book ?
hey , i' m sorry .
look , i' m just trying to get to know you better .
he owns a large hotel chain .
i' m a sales manager for western division for a food service company .
i' m in sales , too .
high end audio and video stuff .
my wife does a little modelling .
really ?
my wife works for a children' s museum , part time .
and we have two kids .
great .
ok , listen .
there' s a place downtown called the zebra lounge .
let' s meet there tomorrow night , say eight o' clock .
no strings attached .
ok .
ok , bye .
get into it
# i' ve been down in such a dark place
# i' ve been a phoney and a fool
# just to please everybody who said that they love me
# and i spat out the food that i was too afraid to swallow
# i' ve been locked up in this attic
# still with love on my brain
# and i tried so hard to get a little sunshine
# yes , i tried so hard
# to break the cycle of pain
# pain , pain ...
# get into it , baby ...
alan , wendy .
i' m jack .
this is my wife louise , the most beautiful woman in the world .
hello .
hi .
get comfortable and jack will order some drinks .
tina , louise and i will have the usual .
and for you ?
a white label , please .
let me guess .
on the rocks ?
yes .
er , the same .
thank you .
i' m so glad you guys decided to get together with us .
we haven' t decided anything yet .
you know , your ad was the first one that we' d answered in several months .
i guess ...
i guess louise and i are getting a little more discriminating .
i suppose we should be flattered .
i don' t know .
i figured i' d put that out there .
it might be a bit more comforting .
it' s lucky you found us first .
we are your first , right ?
oh , yes .
most definitely .
you know what i' ve learned from louise ?
if you just relax and let yourself go , you can really have a lot of fun .
we' ve just never done anything like this before .
nothing' s going to happen that you don' t want to .
oh .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
ok ...
a toast .
to ...
hey .
will you excuse us a minute ?
are we crazy ?
i think they' re pretty normal , considering .
do you like him ?
i don' t know .
i mean , he' s charming .
he' s ... kind of intriguing .
excuse me .
how do you feel about her ?
she' s nice , attractive , very sexy .
yeah , she is very sexy .
i like his eyes .
well , it was nice meeting you two .
we' re going to pass .
i' m so disappointed .
no , that' s ok , if that' s your choice .
but we were having such a nice talk .
please , come finish your drinks .
sure .
you know , baby ,
i wish it would have been that easy for us to fix our little fling problem .
you' re not having affairs yet , are you ?
no , no .
not quite .
it' s problems like that that are difficult to solve .
have you guys read any self help books or done any counselling ?
we haven' t had much luck with them .
we appreciate your concern , but , well , we' re just not ready for this .
you know ,
alan , sometimes it' s not such a good idea to wait until you feel like you' re ready .
i know for louise and i , it felt like we were running out of time .
you know , if we were to do this , how' s it going to work ?
how would it work ?
hypothetically .
of course .
our house is out of the question .
with the kids ours , too .
we have the painters in .
why don' t you guys leave it up to us ?
hypothetically .
yeah .
how does this sound ?
whatever we do , we do it together .
when one of us wants to stop , we both stop , no questions asked .
and we' il never do anything that might hurt the kids .
i couldn' t have put it better myself .
you want me to sign it ?
no , your word' s good enough for me .
look , if this doesn' t feel right , we' il just ... cut it short and come home .
right .
do you think we' re dressed right ?
i don' t know .
i' ve never dressed for an orgy before .
wow , mom .
you look beautiful .
thank you .
you too , daddy .
thanks .
works for them .
i want you to do everything nancy asks you to do .
i promise there' il be something in it for you .
wow !
that' s the biggest car i' ve ever seen .
hi .
who are they ?
just some friends .
we' d better hurry before they bring out the whole neighbourhood .
see you .
bye , mommy .
bye , daddy .
bye .
wow !
glass of champagne to the first person who can guess what louise is doing to me right now .
kidding .
you' ve gone to such expense .
no trouble .
a friend of mine owns the car .
so , how' s the painting going ?
what' s that ?
you said you were getting your house painted .
oh , no , we just say that .
jack and i like to keep our home private .
i wish we' d thought of that .
you guys aren' t in a hurry to get home , are you ?
our sitter can stay the night ...
if we ask her to .
good .
perfect .
so , al ...
is it all right if i call yon al ?
excuse me ?
forget it .
um ...
would you like to trade seats with me ?
because , although louise and i ... don' t look like it , we' re sitting over here feeling a bit like a senate subcommittee .
is that all right ?
sure .
yeah ?
ok .
so , how do we look ?
fabulous .
i would say you' re the second sexiest couple in the car .
you look like
you had a tough day at the office .
actually , i did .
alan' s up for a vice presidency and he' s got some pretty tough competition .
ah , yes .
neil bradley .
little prick .
a little tense ?
you don' t like champagne ?
er , no , it' s the bubbles .
honey ?
yes ?
can we get wendy
some white label ?
sure .
here , let me .
er , dilemma .
pick your hand .
thank you .
here , i' il take this .
a toast
let' s have some fun .
to fun !
come , let me show you the view .
don' t worry .
she' s in good hands .
what did we get him ?
let' s see .
no , no .
it' s already ...
it' s half wrapped .
hi , you are through to the barnets .
leave a message after the beep .
hey , it' s jack here .
where have you two been hiding ?
louise and i would love to see you two again ...
didn' t you return their last call ?
no , i never got round to it .
honey , you' re not trying to string them along , are you ?
i' m just not comfortable with discussing it , that' s all .
tell them that we had a really good time and we appreciate their concern but we don' t need them any more .
they' d take it too personally .
yes .
well , then , tell them that it doesn' t fit into our lifestyle .
i' m sure they can understand that .
ok .
i can do that .
i' il call them .
good .
good .
good .
yes .
what ?
they were incredible , though , weren' t they ?
yeah , they were , but so are we .
one ...
two ...
three ...
blow !
are you about finished with that thing ?
the ice cream' s melting .
how come you scooped it out so soon ?
wendy asked me to .
here , mom , let' s cut this cake .
hello , everybody .
sorry we' re late .
what a great place to have a party .
jack .
louise .
everybody , this is jack and louise .
hi .

and this must be the birthday boy .
is it for me ?
no , it' s for me .
happy birthday , daniel . from aunt louise and uncle jack .
buddy , you have fun with that .
they' re not our aunt and uncle .
they' re just being friendly .
be polite .
is anybody going to give us some cake ?
of course , yes , have some cake .
do you have a smaller piece ?
thanks .
i need a fork and ... ... maybe a napkin .
oh , would you like to have some ?
we' il get our own , ok ?
thanks , pal .
who wants to see uncle jack juggle ?
me !
all right .
check it out .
you' re doing great , honey .
thank you , baby .
alan , if i hadn' t called your secretary ,
i never would have known about this panty .
huh ?
ta da !
everybody loves jack .
don' t you find him attractive ?
because i find your husband ken very good looking .
ken , get the kids .
it' s time to go .
one hand .
sorry .
maybe i can try behind my back .
i could kill your secretary .
you asked her to give out the directions .
yes , to invited guests .
and what was she supposed to do ?
interrogate every caller ?
i got a present , too , from aunt louise .
it' s my unbirthday present .
a bracelet ?
it' s nice , honey .
it' s really nice .
yeah , i know .
i' il call you on tuesday .
yep .
congratulations .
what for ?
for finally getting a shot with paul mcgrew .
no kidding ?
all my nuisance calls must have paid off .
apparently so .
his office called .
he wants to play tennis .
we' ve got a court for one o' clock .
alan , this is our big chance .
when he gets here , you introduce us .
i' il take it from there .
that' s gonna be a little hard .
i don' t even know what he looks like .
well , that must be him right there .
good afternoon , gentlemen .
no .
alan , good to see you .
and you must be the big boss .
i thought you didn' t know what he looks like .
i don' t know what he looks like .
that' s somebody else .
a friend , sort of .
hey , fellas .
i' m jack bauer .
adam frazier .
great to see you , adam .
hey , alan .
jack .
our fourth' s running a little late .
excuse me ?
paul mcgrew .
it' s why you' re here , isn' t it ?
yes , but ...
jack , buddy .
you' re gonna love this guy .
hey .
paul .
good to see you .
hi .
paul mcgrew .
adam frazier .
hi .
alan barnet .
finally .
jack says you' il make me an offer i can' t refuse .
we' re gonna try .
if it' s anywhere near as good as the deal he cut me , we' re gonna be in business .
let' s get to it .
so , paul' s company commissioned my company to do his whole chain .
monitors , speakers , everything .
big screen tvs , wireless speakers in all the bars .
it is going to be sensational .
don' t hurt him , alan .
get you next time , bauer .
any time , paul .
good game .
take it easy , paul .
see you at the office .
i enjoyed that .
i got to do that more often .
he likes you already .
i can tell .
how did you do this ?
it was easy .
just closed him with a great deal .
just like that .
it' s all in the technique .
fpqs .
what ?
friendly , persistent , questioning stare .
you know , when you get to that critical moment in a transaction ...
right . ... this is what i do .
is that good , or what ?
you didn' t tell him about ... us .
of course not .
this is business , buddy .
come on .
let' s play .
let' s play .
jack could sell circles around me .
well , what did he do it for ?
commission ?
finder' s fee ?
to get what he wants .
which is ?
us .
alan , i thought we said we wouldn' t do that any more .
i know .
but it was a huge favour he did .
i mean , i may get the promotion .
there could be a big bonus .
it seems rude not to ...
that' s ridiculous .
i' m sorry .
well ...
forget it .
ok , but is that ...
i mean , is that what you want ?
do you want to do it again ?
do you ?
you want her again , don' t you ?
one more time wouldn' t kill me .
ok .
but just one more time .
when was the last time this car was tuned up ?
i don' t drive it any more , honey .
you do .
if it was my car , i' d pay someone to drive it off a cliff .
when you want to chauffeur the kids round all day , you can take the mini van and i' il take my car back .
you still have a great ass , you know ?
thank you .
you have a great ass , too .
i could get jealous tonight .
i' m hoping you do .
really ?
well , two can play that game .
give us a kiss .
hello , barnets .
we missed you .
we' ve been looking forward to this .
you look amazing .
thank you .
i got my hair done .
hi .
hello .
you' re looking pretty smooth yourself , alan .
why , thank you .
i actually shaved .
what do you think ?
this is awesome .
should have worn toga .
you won' t be needing one .
come on .
i thought we' d try something different tonight .
you guys ever done ecstasy ?
i took a quaalude once in college
well , they' ve made some amazing advances on the recreational drug front .
i' m up for it .
are you cold ?
that' s nice .
you' ve never done this ?
no .
to good friends .
to good business .
have you ever been with a woman before ?

# coming down , going down , getting down , coming down
# cos you came around
# come and seize the disease
# won' t you please stay away for my hands are weak
# i may just die
# and i' il do it again and again and again
# and again
# feeling sin
# feeling sin
# feeling fingers through my hair
# feeling sad
# feeling sad
# don' t you feel it ?
# i may just die
# but i' d do it again and again
# and again and again
# i' m sad
# too sad am i
# i' m lost in your love
# nothing says you don' t believe
# you can' t believe
# lies ...

thank you very much for your presentation .
you obviously put a lot of work into it .
we' il think about it and ... get back to you .

hank , with all due respect , there is nothing to think about .
we all know there isn' t anyone else in this industry who can match our quality , service or price .
so , what do you say ?
what a day !
get promoted in the morning , close a deal the same night .
promoted ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
didn' t adam tell you ?
he picked me .
no , he didn' t tell me .
he probably didn' t want you to fuck up this deal .
fuck it up ?
i closed it , you piece of shit .
we' il bring it up at your review .
see you tomorrow , pal .
are you coming ?
no way .
louise , i can' t do this .

yeah .
ok .
don' t worry about it .
i' il call you .
we' re not the right kind of people , alan .
whatever made us think we could do this ?
honey , we' ve made some mistakes , but they' re in the past .
it' s behind us .
it' s done .
everything is ok .
really .
it' s going to be ok .
really .
what happened to your lip ?
i banged it getting in the car .
it' s nothing .

i promise .
i swear to god .
i swear to god .
are you wearing a new cologne ?
no .
no , it must be that soap .
you' re right .
you' re right , you know .
we ought to get things back on track .
what do you want to do ?
just ... something ... normal .
are you gonna answer the phone ?
hello .
oh , my god !
what ...
the meeting broke up around 10 : 15 .
the last time i saw neil , he was heading for the elevator .
then you didn' t leave together ?
no , i went to the men' s room .
we take separate cars .
so was it a mugging ?
what happened ?
he was beaten to death .
they think a pipe or a lug wrench or something .
jesus .
after you left the men' s room , what did you do ?
i went to the parking garage , got in my car .
did you notice anything unusual in the garage ?
no .
just got in my car and left .
the parking attendant' s records show that you left the garage at 10 : 44 .
wait a minute .
is alan a suspect ?
honey .
some of the night staff said you and mr bradley had an argument in the lobby at about 10 : 20 .
it wasn' t really an argument .
we were discussing a business deal .
i' m just establishing a timeline .
detective , if you think alan had anything to do with this , he is the straightest , most law abiding citizen in the world .
as of now , we don' t have any suspects .
so , are we through , then ?
sure .
i know where i can find you .
sorry to bother you both so late .
oh , what happened to your lip ?
oh , i banged it on the car door .
i' m a real klutz sometimes .
i' m still hungry .
let' s make cookies .
we haven' t done that in a long time .
chocolate chip .
i like peanut butter .
what do you think , dad ?
huh ?
oh , i' m sorry .
whatever .
uncle jack !
we just had pizza .
hey , right on , brother !
where' s aunt louise ?
she' s at home , but she told me to give you a big hug .
now , run in there and see .
i brought you a surprise .
oh , boy !
went for pizza , huh ?
yeah .
how did you get in ?
everybody always leaves a key right under their potted plant .
mom , dad , come see what uncle jack bought us .
wow , they' re almost life size .
this is awesome !
we asked for one of these for christmas the last two years , but mom and dad said we couldn' t afford it .
thanks , uncle jack .
he' s not your uncle , daniel .
why don' t you take your brother outside ?
oh , do we have to ?
just go .
i hope you like where i put it .
i went through the whole house and this seemed
like the best spot .
can we get right to the point ?
we can' t accept the tv .
you have to take it back .
and ... we really resent you breaking into our house .
can you get out of my chair , please ?
i don' t understand .
i was just trying to surprise you guys .
we don' t want to see you or louise any more .
it' s not right for us .
and , frankly , we wish we' d never gotten into it .
that' s too bad .
louise and i always saw this as a long term relationship .
it' s not going to work out .
hang on , guys .
i mean , what happened here ?
it' s just a tv .
listen , louise and i have been playing the field for a long time .
we' ve had a lot of fun , but that' s not so safe to do any more .
we had always hoped that we would meet a nice couple so that we could all just settle down .
jack ...
we are totally committed to you .
we' re not interested .
you got to find somebody else .
in the meantime , get your tv , take it out of here , and then we can all go on with our lives .
you make it all sound so simple , al .
it is , jack .
no , it' s not , wendy .
you see , underneath all ,
louise and i , we want the same things that you guys do .
nice house , family , friends .
you' ve really opened our eyes .
jack .
i' m sorry but this ...
this is not our problem .
i was looking forward to spending more time with you since you got the promotion .
you got that promotion ?
i ... i was next in line .
he deserved it .
too bad what happened to neil .
i think it' s time you ... go .
yeah .
you' re probably right .
you bastard !
turn it off !
it' s a gift .
for your eyes only .
i won' t show anyone else .
you won' t believe this .
give me the control .
wait till you see what we got .
come on , guys .
let' s go outside .
you think jack killed neil , don' t you ?
no .
i don' t know .
what do you think ?
i think we don' t know a damn thing about either one of them .
i' ve been thinking about this vice presidency and it ... it doesn' t feel right .
alan , just relax .
you' ve earned it .
now , we all feel bad about neil , but what happened wasn' t your fault .
every dog has his day .
this is yours .
jack !
how are you ?
good , adam .
nice to see you .
congratulations on the promotion .
why are you here ?
i was just going to tell you about this .
jack is outfitting us with a closed circuit video surveillance system offices , warehouses , parking lots .
he' s going to make sure our employees are safe from now on .
there' s nothing more important .
i' il get those figures from you later , jack .
you take care , now .
well , everything' s falling right into place .
i' ve got work to do .
al an .
you know how much we love you guys , right ?
do me a favour .
tell wendy to call off the investigation .
what the hell are you talking about ?
call her .
ask her what she' s been doing all day .
fuck , verna !
i' m sorry .
sorry .
that detective called .
he wants to talk to you again .
thank you .
let' s go , daniel !
come on , hustle it , hustle it .
positions , kids .
positions !
this guy at the bar said jack put a man' s head through a window and louise just laughed .
people have fights in bars .
the guy was louise' s first husband .
i found out at the library that he was killed in a skiing accident a month later .
so ?
there were no witnesses .
that was a really dumb thing , going down that bar all by yourself .
too bad .
the point is , i think we have to tell the police .
what ?
tell them what ?
that the couple we' ve been swinging with aren' t upright citizens ?
if we tell the police , everything' s gonna come out .
all there is to do is to put as much distance between us and them as possible .
did you see me ?
did you see what i did ?
sorry , champ .
what happened ?
he just scored the winning goal .
oh , god !
excuse me .
daniel !
hello ?
bottle of brandy for the new neighbours .
hi , neighbours .
no , you' re not .
i love the suburbs .
look who' s here .
it' s great .
oh , hi !
so , what do you think ?
ok , you' ve made your point .
this isn' t gonna change anything .
cos we' re not like you .
and we never will be .
what has happened to you two ?
i mean , didn' t we make your lives more exciting ?
isn' t that what you wanted ?
all we wanted to do was be close to you .
you just stay away from us .
you better straighten her out , alan .
everything' s fine over here .
this doesn' t need to be complicated .
i spoke to a couple of agents today .
the real estate market' s still in the dumper .
our house is upside down .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
it means that we ...
it means that we owe more money on our loan than the house is worth .
you still want to sell ?
of course .
what do you think ?
i don' t understand why you want to sell this house .
it' s an awful thing to do to the kids , make them change schools ,
leave their friends .
there are other factors involved , mother .
is there something wrong between you and alan ?
no !
i mean , no , why would you ask such a thing ?
well ...
it' s just that ...
oh , dear .
it' s just ... that brooke asked me today if anything happened to you or her father , could she and daniel live with me .
now , why would she say a thing like that ?
i don' t know , mother .
she' s a kid .
they say strange things .
is that the fella that came to daniel' s birthday party ?
yeah .
the strange couple .
yes , mother .
i didn' t know they were your neighbours .
can we have dessert in front of the tv ?
too bad we can' t watch it on our big screen .
brooke .
you have a big screen tv ?
we used to have one .
but mom broke it .
too bad , huh ?
who wants ice cream with their pie ?
i want to hear about this tv .
it was a present from uncle jack .
mom smashed it on purpose .
yeah , just a second .
it' s for you , dad .
it' s a detective .
oh , boy !
let' s have our pie in the other room .
hello ?
er , no , look , i' ve already told you everything i know .
no , i' m with my family .
no , monday i can' t .
i have meetings all day .
tuesday ?
10am .
sure .
ok .
hi , how was your day ?
i can' t stop thinking about this meeting with that cop tomorrow .
you' re just gonna tell him the same thing as before .
where you were that night and what you did .
how complicated could that be ?
daddy !
hey champ .
ah , ah , ah , ah !
how was your day ?
ok .
where' s your sister ?
she' s still at scouts .
no , she isn' t .
she went next door .
to the newmans ' ?
no , to uncle jack and aunt louise' s .
brooke where are you ?
we' re playing dress up .
how do i look ?
how dare you do this to my child ?
it' s just pretend , mom .
wendy , come on .
go straight home .
we' re calling the police .
what are you talking about ?
she came here on her own .
she' s 11 years old , you sick fuck .
you better not have touched her .
take it easy .
it was an innocent little game .
as if you' re innocent .
to people like you , innocent means you didn' t get caught .
you mean people like us .
we know about your husband' s accident .
and what about neil ?
oh , well , i like this game .
go ahead .
call the cops .
but you might want to consider what people might think of some dirty little facts about you two .
like your mother , wendy .
or adam frazier and the boys at work , alan .
or how about the parents of all those kiddies that come through wendy' s museum ?
and you know who' d really like to see that tape ?
child protective services .
they' d have your kids out of here so quick , it' d look like a fucking alien abduction .
you two are repulsive .
you didn' t find me repulsive the other night at your offices .
what ?
that' s right , wendy . you see your husband here , he fucked me .
and he fucked me in an elevator .
and he fucked me better than he' s ever fucked you .
do we understand each other ?
look , it was stupid and spur of the moment .
i didn' t think .
in the elevator , for christ' s sake !
look , wendy , i' m sorry .
i' il do whatever you want .
you broke the rules .
there are no rules .
it was a big mistake .
a mistake that never would have occurred to me .
i was raised catholic , for christ' s sake !
you were in this every step of the way .
not every step .
and now they have their hooks in our kids .
i' m calling the police .
stop it !
wait .
i don' t know how i' m going to tell my mother .
i might be able to get a job in cleveland .
of course , i won' t have a reference .
you make your plans .
just don' t include me and the kids .
did you hear that ?
shit !
yeah .
hey , buddy .
borrowed your lug wrench a few weeks ago .
i thought i' d get you another one .
you took my lug wrench ?
with my fingerprints on it .
don' t worry , it' s in a safe place .
see you , alan .
by the way , did you really think we' d let the two of you leave ?
here it is in a nutshell .
you guys win .
we decided to give it a try .
no , everything went fine with the cops .
i stayed calm and said all the right things .
it' s like the guy said about the prospect of being hanged .
it concentrates the mind wonderfully .
we figured it was time to call a truce .
all of us , the four of us .
yeah , that' s what i was calling about .
yeah .
us , too .
we have a great place .
it' s very secluded .
a client of mine owns it .
he' s gonna be away .
right .
well , you talk to louise and we can set a date .
great .
talk to you soon .
do you really think you can do this ?
you haven' t braided my hair for a really long time .
i guess i just felt like it .
does this mean you' re not mad at me any more ?
i was never mad at you , sweetheart .
then how come you act so mean all the time ?
it' s not your fault .
i' m sorry , honey .
um ...
maybe one day you' il have a family of your own , and you' il find out how hard it is to try to do everything right all the time .
try to be everything for everybody , but it is not possible .
we make mistakes .
but i promise you ... that things are gonna change .
i' m gonna do better , ok ?
i love you .
you' re a pretty girl .
do you think they' re suspicious ?
maybe .
the thing to remember is , jack can' t think past his dick .
so if we keep their minds focused on sex , we should be ok .
hey , look .
brooke' s retainer .
hey , guys .
what a really nice place .
love the boots , wendy .
scotch ?
no , thank you .
are you sooner ?
it' s your favourite .
i' m fine .
really .
thanks .
baby .
come here .
why don' t we go upstairs and go exploring ?
that is a great idea .
that way , wendy and i can stay right here and snuggle .
i tell you what .
why don' t the two of you go upstairs and wendy and i will meet you up there soon .
you know , you guys are acting a little weird .
are you sure that you' re not still holding a grudge ?
no .
er , no .
can' t we just talk ?
why rush it ?
let' s enjoy it .
baby .
hm ?
i' m getting a really bad feeling about this .
really ?
why don' t you feel these ?
i' m glad we could all be friends again .
wendy , honey , i' m so sorry .
i never meant it to go that far .
if i could have thought of a way to stop it , i would have .
just get in there and get it over with while they' re still asleep .
you think that' s gonna make your problems go away ?
i wish you had the nerve to pull that trigger .
then i' d die respecting you .
go to bed , alan .
come on .
come on .
come on , you piece of shit !
perfect !
now what ?
our car broke down once in yellowstone .
you know what we did ?
let me guess .
you fucked .
right there , in the middle of the park .
it seemed like the only thing to do .
what i' ve learned is , if you find yourself in a situation beyond your control , the smartest thing you can do is relax and go along for the ride .
then there was that cute little park ranger that came out of nowhere .
that' s right .
he was going to cite us .
yeah .
baby , remember santorini ?
all that beautiful black sand ?
of course , you stole the show by going topless on the beach .
had all those greek boys about ready to snap it right there .
how long till we reach the gas station ?
you know what ?
we should go there .
we could bring the kids .
that' s a great idea .
of course , i can' t wait to see that black sand all over wendy' s big beautiful tits .
lou !
you want to do this now ?
jack , keep your eye on the road !
we' re fine , guys .
quiet .
i' m trying to concentrate .
jack , we will walk .
please !
slow down !
don' t stop .
i' il never stop .
jack !
jack , look out !
we crashed .
we fucking crashed !
ha , ha ha !
we crashed !
louise ?
louise ?
baby ?
louise ?
lou !
louise ?
louise !
louise ?
oh , baby .
louise !
alan !
alan !
alan !
wendy !
come on , you guys .
you got to help us get out of here .
where are you guys ?
i can' t get my fucking leg out !
alan , i' m stuck !
come back and get us out of here .
you don' t want to get rid of me .
you' il never get rid of me .
come on , guys .
we' re still a team , right ?
when this is all over ... ... we got to do it again .
alan !
how do you feel about getting the kids a puppy for christmas ?
there' s no way round it , really .
we practically promised it to them .
did i tell you the dentist said danny' s gonna need braces ?
bills .
bills , bills , bills , bills .
and more bills .
want a back rub ?
really ?
sure .
where' s the lotion ?
get the ball .
get the ball .
challenge , challenge .
danny , good boy !
