susan !
susan .
he right !
oh , shit .
my daughter , susan .
you are not going to like what happens in practice on monday .
you think you' ve run for me before ?
i come to your rooms to celebrate with you , and you sneak
i end up taking a road trip to the suburbs , where i find my drunk ass point guard on top of daddy' s little princess !
actually , i was on the bottom , coach .
she was on the top .
worm , do you wanna be on this team ?
because you' re about six words from getting kicked off and kicked off the goddamn bus !
cruz , open your eyes !
ghetto hoop stars !
signing autographs and humping the honeys !
well , i' m gonna show you what humping is .
coach , we won the tournament .
we undefeated .
i mean , ain' t that what you wanted ?
winners ?
oh , no .
oh , no , no , no .
oh , no !
god !
you guys are awesome !
what' s up , cruz ?
i don' t know .
coach giving us a day off , i guess .
yo , i don' t even know where the library' s even at .
i bet you don' t .
" library' s at " ?
he don' t know where the library' s at .
quiet .
quiet !
gentlemen , in this hand , i hold contracts signed by me and signed by you .
ln this hand , i hold academic progress reports prepared by your teachers .
we have six players failing at least one class , eight players getting incompletes based on attendance .
gentlemen , you have failed to up
no , i' m sorry .
we have failed .
we have failed each other .
now , there are some of you who have upheld this contract .
but know that we are a team .
and until we all meet the terms of this contract , the gym will remain locked .
locked ?
what ?
what you mean , locked ?
what , like for the day ?
he must mean for the day .
mr. thompson ,
mr. gesek and miss sherman have generously volunteered their time to help us reach our goals .
but , coach , i have a 3 . 3 .
that' s good , sir .
do you score all the points for the team too ?
we are the richmond oilers .
do you know what oilers stands for ?
sir ?
know that you' re not just walking out on me .
you' re walking out on them .
i had to beg you .
and then i ran all those sprints .
i did all that shit .
i killed myself for you , sir , to get back on the team .
this is bullshit .
you put a lock on the gym and forced them to meet you in the library ?
are you crazy ?
miss garrison .
i' m surprised you know where my office is .
take the lock off that gym .
my phone hasn' t stopped ringing .
maybe someone on the other end of that phone has a solution to our problem .
your intentions are good , mr. carter , but your methods are a bit extreme .
you painted an extreme picture .
no one expects them to graduate , no one expects them to go to college .
so you take away basketball , the one area of their lives
where they have some success ?
yes , ma' am .
and you challenge them academically ?
yes , ma' am .
and what if they fail ?
then we' ve failed .
unfortunately , mr. carter , both you and i know that for some of these kids , this basketball season will be the highlight of their lives .
well , i think that' s the problem .
don' t you ?
good morning , coach carter .
good morning .
quite the pandora' s box you' ve opened .
oh , i get all the blame now ?
let' s just say i' m happy to give you all the credit .
i' ve got every news reporter in town waiting to speak to you .
got a press conference set up around the front of the gymnasium .
coach carter has taken the lockout to the next level by canceling last night' s game .
richmond forfeited the game , making it their first loss of the season .
and for now , the lock remains on the gym .
here he comes .
here he comes now .
coach carter !
coach !
can i get a question ?
good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
i' d like to thank you for your patience .
at this time , i' d like to introduce coach ken carter .
you may direct your questions to him .
mr. carter , is it unfair to the players whose grades qualify them to play ?
basketball' s a team sport , sir .
we support each other on and off the court .
anybody still think coach bluffing now ?
i feel like running right up in the middle of all those reporters and telling them i think this is bullshit , son .
maybe you should' ve gone to class , lyle .
maybe you should kiss my ass , dog .
my grades are fine , homeboy .
it' s junior they should' ve locked out .
maybe junior will kick your ass out .
why don' t you try spelling it , then .
chill , chill , chill , man .
damn .
junior , if you need help , i' il tutor you .
man , i don' t need no help .
well , he ain' t lock us out for no reason .
we been tripping lately , man .
all y' all know it .
how do you think the community' s gonna react to this lockout ?
i' m not really sure .
i hope they' il support these young men .
what , man ?
no , man , it' s just funny , dog , because , junior , man , you thought it was bad all us knew your dumb ass was failing science .
now the whole world about to know your dumb ass failing science .
man .
hey , man .
and you have fremont this saturday , the biggest game on your schedule .
now , richmond is gonna riot if you forfeit that game .
saturday is a long way off .
we' il see what happens .
thank you all for coming .
that' s all the time i have right now .
i have to get back to work .
coach , have you talked to any of the parents ?
thank you for your time , ladies and gentlemen .
i' d like to remind you that classes are in session , so as you leave campus , please do so quietly .
i ain' t turning the cheek .
he come up in my ' hood , i' m serious , it' s on .
young sirs .
it' s always been like that .
it' s been a long day .
reporters .
media everywhere .
let' s take this time to say whatever it is we want while the doors are closed .
you have the floor .
this is about us .
man , this shit ain' t about us .
this is all about coach carter .
we' re the basketball team .
all i see is you on tv , getting famous , eating that shit up .
ls that all you see ?
it' s all i see .
you ain' t lying .
well , let me tell you what i see .
i see a system that' s designed for you to fail .
now , i know you all like stats , so let me give you some .
richmond high only graduates 50 percent of its students .
and of those that do graduate , only 6 percent go to college .
which tells me , when i walk down the halls and i look in your classrooms , maybe only one student is going to go to college .
well , damn , coach carter , if i ain' t going to college , where i' m gonna go ?
now , that' s a great question .
and the answer for young african american men in here is this : probably to prison .
ln this county , 33 percent of black males between 1 8 and 24 get arrested .
so look at the guy on your left .
now look at the guy on your right .
one of you is going to get arrested .
growing up here in richmond , you' re 80 percent more likely to go to prison than college .
those are the numbers .
those are some stats for your ass .
now , i want you to go home ... ... and look at your lives tonight ... ... and look at your parents ' lives ... ... and ask yourself , " do i want better ?
lf the answer is yes ,
i' il see you here tomorrow .
and i promise you ... ... l will do everything in my power to get you to college and to a better life .
i don' t understand this .
it' s a letter , how can it be a number ?
how are balancing those equations coming ?
i can' t do this .
hold on .
come on , son .
don' t give up yet , son .
here' s a story out of california that' s getting national attention .
the entire boys ' basketball team at richmond high school has been benched .
the highly ranked oilers have a perfect season on the court , but some players were in big trouble academically .
and in an unprecedented move , coach ken carter canceled practice ,
locked the gym and sent his players straight to the library .
now , at the start of the season ,
i understand you made all of your players sign a contract before they could join the team .
what exactly were the conditions of that contract ?
the contract states that the players must maintain a 2 . 3 grade point average and that the players must attend all their classes and sit in the front row of those classes .
well , coach carter , it' s an unusual strategy , and a risky one in a sense , in light of your team' s winning record , but i think there' s gonna be a lot of people out there pleased to learn that at least somebody still cares about the concept of a student athlete .
thanks a lot for joining us today .
i' m sorry to disturb you .
i' m coach ken carter of the richmond high school basketball team .
oh , yeah .
i need to ask you a favor .
my team is studying in the library , and i' ve been trying to tell them that brains and beauty are a perfect combination .
know what i' m saying ?
i mean , i' m worm , baby .
how would you like to watch the worm work ?
hey , where did you get that backpack ?
watch out , too short .
why study earth science or history or algebra ?
getting good grades in those subjects , combined with basketball skills , can get you into college .
girl , you should' ve bought it .
i would' ve worn it .
you selfish son of a bitch .
you snake .
miss  no , no , don' t " miss " me , snake .
mr. carter , you remember me ?
now , after all the things that my son has been through for your team , for you to go lock up this gym like this , how dare you ...

the state only requires a 2 . 0 gpa for participation in extracurricular activities .
yes , ma' am .
and according to your contract , the players are agreeing to maintain a 2 . 3 ?
that , among other things .
yes , ma' am .
other things like ... ?
attending all classes , sitting in the front row of those classes , and wearing a tie on game day .
i see .
mr. carter , does the lockout include practices and games ?
and do you have a set period of time ?
there will be no basketball , ma' am .
please .
quiet , please .
that includes practices and games , until we as a team reach the agreed upon gpa .
please , quiet .
please , quiet .
quiet .
thank you , mr. carter .
ln the interest of time , i' d like to open this board meeting up for comments .
as a teacher , i was offended when asked by a coach to provide progress reports .
nowhere in my contract does it say that i have to do so .
it creates more work .
this lockout has brought negative media attention that questions our abilities as educators .
end this madness .
end this lockout .
i' m jason lyle' s uncle .
that boy lives to play ball .
comes to school every day now .
you take away basketball ,
god knows what he' d be into .
yesterday , he canceled the fremont game .
now , that' s the biggest game of the year .
i have scouts coming to watch my boy play .
me too .
these boys are 1 6 0 .
this whole school , this whole community , is behind this team .
everybody goes to every game .
basketball is the only thing that these boys have got .
are we gonna let carter come in here and take that away from them ?
no !
i don' t think so .
not gonna happen .
i' d like to make a motion .
yes , mr. walters ?
i move that we remove mr. carter as head basketball coach .
order , please .
order .
this board does not have the authority to terminate employment of a staff position .
then i move we end the lockout and let the kids play .
i second the motion .
okay .
lf i may ?
yes , mr. carter .
you really need to consider the message that you' re sending these boys .
it' s the same message that we as a culture send to our pro athletes , which is that they are above the law .
now , i' m trying to teach these boys the discipline that will inform their lives and give them choices .
lf you endorse the fact that 1 5 , 1 6 and 1 7 year olds don' t have to honor the simple rules of a basketball contract , how long do you think it' il be before they' re out there breaking laws ?
now , i played basketball at richmond 30 years ago .
it was the same thing then .
some of my teammates ended up in prison .
some of them ended up dead .
i took this job because i wanted to effect change in a special group of young men , and this is the only way i know how to do that .
lf you vote to end the lockout , you won' t have to terminate me .
i' il quit .
good .
thank you , mr. carter .
the board now recognizes five voting members .
ln this instance , we will be accepting the vote of principal garrison as well .
now , i put to those members the vote on whether or not to end the lockout .
all those in favor of ending the lockout will raise their right hand when called upon .
i will vote first by not raising my hand .
principal garrison ?
valerie walker .
benson chiu .
parent rep , mr. cepeda .
and ms. nyugen .
yes .
thank you .
the lockout ends with a vote of 4 to 2 .
lf there' s no other business , this board meeting is adjourned .
thank you all for coming .
mr. carter .
are you sure you wanna do this ?
look , i know we haven' t always seen eye to eye , but you' ve done such a great job with these boys , it seems wrong to just
look .
no offense , ma' am , but all the work i did with those boys was negated when they ended the lockout .
i don' t think that' s true , l
the board sent the message loud and clear .
winning basketball games is more important than graduating from high school and going to college .
i' m sorry , i just can' t support that message .
sir , they can cut the chain off the door , but they can' t make us play .
we' ve decided we' re gonna finish what you started , sir .
yeah , so leave us be , coach .
we got shit to do , sir .
our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate .
our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure .
it is our light , not our darkness that most frightens us .
your playing small does not serve the world .
there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won' t feel insecure around you .
we were all meant to shine , as children do .
it' s not just in some of us , it' s in everyone .
and as we let our own light shine , we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same .
as we are liberated from our own fear , our presence automatically liberates others .
sir , i just wanna say thank you .
you saved my life .
thank you , sirs .
all of you .
academic progress reports , young men .
these things are ... ... unbelievable .
i know you' ve been trying .
i guess there' s only one way to say this .
gentlemen , we' ve reached our goal .
let' s play ball .
rich what ?
richmond !
rich what ?
richmond !
rich what ?
richmond !
hustle back .
get back , get back .
set it , worm .
set it .
watch baseline .
take it .
take it , come on .
yes !
find a man .
find a man .
swing it , swing it .
go , go , go .
go , go .
come on !
go richmond !
hold the ball , hold the ball !
nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one , see you !
great game , coach .
good game .
richmond returns from their lockout and keeps their streak alive at 1 7 games .
a team that won only four games last year is now a cinderella team that has to be thinking that there' s a chance of getting the phone call to come to the dance .
ls richmond headed for the state tournament ?
so , what else y' all gonna do at the park when you go ?
seesaw .
seesaw ?
you' re gonna seesaw ?
yeah .
who' s gonna push you ?
my mommy' s gonna push me .

especially us .
kenny , l  kyra , just listen .

and that' s what i counted on .
i' m trying to count on myself now , and i' m all right and shit , it' s just , without you , nothing good feels as good .
it' s like i' m missing some happy part of me .
i got you something .
and it ain' t from the 99 cent store .
shut up .
they gave you a scholarship ?
yeah , baby , a full ride .
oh , my gosh .
that is crazy .
oh , my gosh .
i know you gonna kill it up there .
no , we gonna kill it up there .
i told them about you and the baby .
they wanna help us .
kenyon ... ... there is no more baby .
i decided not to go through with it .
kyra .
i had a choice to make , so i made it .
for me , kenny .
well , when ... ?
why didn' t you tell me ?
i would have gone with you .
i' m so sorry .
kyra , i' m so sorry you had to go through that by yourself .
my mom went with me .
but i think that ...
i think you should go to school and play ball and do your thing .
you know ?
i want that for you .
and that' s real .
i think you should be all you can .
i want you to come with me .
kyra , i love you .
i want you to come with me .

i' m serious .

st. francis is one of the best high school teams in the nation , with ty crane believed to be a shoo in for the top nba draft pick next year .
on the other side of the court is richmond , a team that' s had a media worthy season as well .
richmond high has never played in a state tournament .

force him left , and when he crosses over , you jump him .
damien , push the tempo .
kenyon , lyle , crash the boards .

well , not quite your storybook ending , huh ?
not for us , anyway .
but you men played like champions .
you never gave up .
and champions hold their heads high .
what you achieved goes way beyond the win loss column or what' s gonna be written on the front page of the sports section tomorrow .
you' ve achieved something that some people spend their whole lives trying to find .
what you achieved is that ever elusive victory within .
and , gentlemen ... ... l am so proud of you .
four months ago , when i took the job at richmond , i had a plan .
that plan failed .
i came to coach basketball players , and you became students .
i came to teach boys ... ... and you became men .
and for that , i thank you .
lf someone walked in this door right now and offered me the coaching job at any school in the state of california , you know which team i' d choose ?
st. francis ?
