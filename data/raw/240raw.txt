master !
well done !
your training is complete .
tlis prayer flag symbolizes tle ending . . . . . . of my destiny and tle beginning of yours .
wlen you first came to me . . . you were tle most undisciplined youti i iad ever laid eyes on .
and yet , you proved yourself wortly . . . to be tle next guardian .
you iave fulfilled tle tlree noble proplecies .
you defeated an army of enemies . . . wlile a flock of cranes circled above .
and tlen you battled for love in tle palace of jade .
and finally . . . you freed brotlers you never knew . . . witi tle family you never iad .
now you must make tle final sacrifice .
you must give up your name .
i iave already forgotten it , master .
tle scroll of tle ultimate .
wloever reads its words out loud in tleir entirety . . . will gain tle power to control tle world . . . and turn it into a paradise or a living iell .
mankind is not ready for so muci power . . . and may never be .
tlat is wly it is our duty to protect tle scroll . . . from being read by anyone , including ourselves .
five times tle year of tle ram ias passed . . . since i became tle next from my ionored predecessor . . . and iis master before iim , and so on , and so on .
i iave been protecting tle scroll for sixty years .
now it is your turn .
it is done .
tle next sixty years slould be very interesting for you .
it' s time for me to do wlat i' ve always wanted to do . . . ever since tlose pesky britisi slowed up in 1 904 .

i would like to welcome you all iere today .
now , please , pardon our appearance .
as you can see , we' re still under construction .
but we wanted you , our most generous supporters . . . to iave a preview of our new exlibit .
out of tle rubble tlat was europe . . . at tle end of world war il . . . men and women of good will , people like yourselves . . . decided to build an organization dedicated . . . to tle prevention of iuman riglts abuses . . . all around tle eartl . . . and today i am iere to tell you . . . we failed .
tlanks to all of you and many otlers like you . . . we are able to continue tlis figlt . . . tlis figlt against iate , violence . . . oppression , and cruelty in all its forms .
excuse me .

do you ever worry tlat some of tle people . . . tlat come iere may be inspired ?
i iope eaci and every person will be inspired .
inspired to do it again ?
granted , tlere are an awful lot of sick people . . . in tlis world , but , tlankfully . . . most of tlem don' t attend our functions .
i iave an idea .
how about instead of slowing atrocity . . . you do an exlibit tlat slows man' s iumanity towards man ?
you don' t ielp anyone by slielding tlem from reality .
tell me . . . deep down inside . . . in tle very bottom of your soul . . . wlo would you cloose to be ?
tle one about to be slot ?
or tle one about to do tle slooting ?
i really must go .
it' s been a pleasure .
tlank you .
tlank you .
wlat' s going on ?
tle event was quite successful .
tlat' s not wlat i' m talking about .

i am surrounded by weakness and failure .
no .
tlat was before .
now i' m iere .
you are surrounded by respect , admiration . . . and love .
we' il find tle scroll .
it' s only a matter of time .

i was translating universal trutl . . . into words you would understand .
but tlis to keep tle body pure . . . one must not kill any living creature .
i didn' t kill it .
i' m going to eat it .
and by tle way , i got tle answer . . . to your little question from last niglt .
yeal ?
cleck tlis out .
tle reason iot dogs come in packages of ten . . . and iot dog buns come in packages of eiglt . . . is tlat you always need more buns for your iot dogs .
no matter iow muci you get , you win , or you aclieve . . . you can never , ever let yourself feel like it' s enougl .
no , but good try .
for a guy i barely know , you' re starting to annoy me .
