it' s time .
you said something about resurrection ...
the power of getting the dead soul back to the body .
it can be used only in the forest of resurrection ...
now what ?
here is the forest of resurrection .
i don' t understand .
he is resurrecting the dead with the power .
resurrection ?
i have killed them .
that' s because ...
who' s that ?
another one .
is she dead too ?
no , she' s alive .
what are you ?
don' t kill her !
i was only trying to help .
help ?
i never lose .
what the hell ... ?
stop .
huh ?
they' re around here ...
what ?
i can smell ...
smell ?
i smell ...
like a top dog breeder .
smell ?
like a dog breeder ?
i smell ...
look .
an escapee .
here is the death warrant !
go !
die !
shit ...
this way ...
no .
wait !
you' re not ...
you' re not ...
let me talk , bitch !
speak .
you' re not a monster yet , right ?
you neither , aren' t you .
hold it !
i was just taken here ...
bitch !!!
it seems we are the only survivors .
...
baby .
what' s going on ?
i don' t know , let' s get out of here .
with you ?
come on , i know this place !
okay .
one wrong move and you' re dead .
okay .
you changed .
get up .
don' t you remember ?
remember what ?
about me ...
never seen you before .
why did you help me then ?
i didn' t mean to help .
you came after me ... and saved me .
what did you mean by destiny ?
i will tell you .
you ...
good ...
you' re still alive .
so you caused all of these .
i knew you could survive .
i don' t know you .
fuck off .
your soul does ...
whatever .
what do you want ?
time has come .
give me the girl and come with me .
no .
what are you both talking about ?
he really doesn' t remember anything at all ?
leave us alone .
no , i' ve waited ...
what do you want ?
he wants me dead .
what ?
come , i' il grant you a power .
let' s talk between us .
what' s going on ?
the girl' s blood gives me a power .
this is the forest of resurrection .
the gate .
portal to the other side .
where the dead become zombies ... that' s about it .
the real power of the forest is much greater .
there are two keys to open the gate to the other side .
one is human sacrifice , the other is the blood of resurrection .
i found them ...
500 years ago .
you' re totally insane .
come with me .
i' il show you the power of darkness .
don' t tell me what to do !
just listen .
you can' t kill me .
shut up .
you made me wait 500 years for the girl to reincarnate .
but i forgive you .
i' ve waited for her to reincarnate and mature .
today , the forest and her blood will open the gate to the other side .
i found you in jail .
i never expected you to be serving a life term in prison .
why did you want me ?
i like you better as a criminal now .
you use to be an awful man of justice .
you really made me suffer .
but you' ve changed .
that' s why i brought you here .
don' t let me down this time .
get lost ...
your instinct changed you .
so far , you' ve killed 43 people .
you are just like me ,
little brother .
brother ?
feel the power of the forest ?
people are born ...
live ...
and die .
the darkness after death is what' s real ...
come , i' il guide you .
let your evil instinct overcome you .
i' d rather die than live with you .
then die .
as i planned .
get the girl .
don' t you dare touch me .
huh ?
kill me .
still a bitch .
he could never save you , and never will .
you finished with your role .
you never grow up ...
i' ve waited ...
i have returned after years .
and i offered you blood .
open the gate , and grant me a power .
power !
why ?
this can' t be ...
why ?
my blood works only once .
i' ve already used it .
can you wait till i reincarnate again ?
i' il kill you !
well , did you think i' d really kill you ?
you can' t fool me .
you can' t stop me .
your blood is not enough to open the gate .
you know why ?
do you understand this ?
why did i bring him ?
yes ...
you resurrected him ...
his resurrected blood is the true key .
cry in despair !
cry ...
hey .
you talk too much .
here is the last key ...
now i remember ...
here i am .
don' t touch my girl , fuckin ' asshole !
so you wanna play a little before we start ?
wait for me ...
don' t worry .
i never lose .
stay there .
wait here for one of us to return .
he' s different now .
you might lose this time .
maybe ...
we' il see what happens ...
no pain , no gain .
right ?
freeze ...
freeze ...
i said freeze !
leave the car .
what !
what !
what !
you runt !!!
we' re taking your car !
out of my way !
bugger off !
so ...
you are a fighter .
quiet , i' m sick of this place !
you short ass bitch !
come on !
get in !
let' s go !
not my fault !!!
you !
prisoner number ksc2 303 !
give me my right hand back !
i' m not left handed !
you can' t hit me !
i have 500 times faster reflexes than mike tyson !

no chance .
your power is not enough .
the darkside has chosen me .
i told you ,
i never lose .
listen ...
what ?
you came back because of the forest and my blood .
you might die if you leave here .
maybe ...
we' il see what happens ...
i should have been on your side .
there' s nothing left to destroy in this world .
take me to the other side , brother .
