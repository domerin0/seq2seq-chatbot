can i help you ?
they told me to take a streetcar named desire ... ... then transfer to one called cemeteries ... ... ride 6 blocks and get off at elysian fields .
there' s your car .
thanks .
when he got home , she was waiting .
you never heard nothing ...
what' s wrong ?
you lost ?
i' m looking for elysian fields .
this is elysian fields .
what number ?
642 .
don' t need to look no further .
i' m looking for my sister , stella dubois , i mean , mrs. stanley kowalski .
that' s the party , all right .
you just did miss her , though .
this ...
can this be her home ?
she lives downstairs , i live up .
she' s out ?
you notice the bowling alley ?
i' m not sure i did .
that' s where she' s at .
she' s watching stanley bowl .
blanche !
stella !
oh , stella for a star !
my darling .
now , then , let me look at you .
but don' t look at me .
i won' t be looked at in this glare .
did you find our place ?
what' re you doing in a place like that ?
never , never in my worst dreams did i picture ...
only poe , mr. edgar allan poe , could do justice to it !
what are you doing in that horrible place ?
i didn' t mean to say that .
i meant to be nice and say , " what a convenient location !
you haven' t said a word to me .
i haven' t had a chance .
now open your pretty mouth and talk .
come say hello to stanley first .
no , not now .
just say hello .
which is he ?
which one is he ?
is he the one ...
the one making all the rhubarb !
isn' t he wonderful iooking ?
i can' t meet him now .
not till i' ve bathed and rested .
would you like a cold drink ?
bless that lovely inspiration .
oh , baby .
would you like some pop ?
honey !
pop !
not with my nerves tonight .
a scotch please .
grape .
you haven' t asked me how i happened to get away from school ... ... before the term ended .
thought you' d tell me if you wanted to .
you thought i' d been fired ?
no !
i thought you might have resigned .
i was so exhausted by all i' d been through , my nerves broke .
i was on the verge of lunacy , almost .
so mr. graves ...
he' s the high school superintendent ...
thank you .
he suggested ... ... i take a leave of absence .
i couldn' t put all those details into the wire .
this feels so good .
like another ?
one' s my limit .
you haven' t said a word about my appearance .
you look fine .
god love you for a liar .
daylight never exposed so total a ruin .
but you' ve put on some weight .
you' re as plump as a partridge .
it' s so becoming to you .
yes , it is !
or i wouldn' t say it !
you just have to watch around the hips a little .
i wanted you to look at my figure .
i haven' t put on one ounce in 10 years .
i weigh now what i weighed the summer you left belle reve ... ... the summer dad died and you left us .
it' s just incredible , blanche , how well you look .
sure you don' t want another ?
maybe i will take just one tiny nip more ... ... to put the stopper on .
don' t worry , your sister' s not a drunk .
she' s just all shaken up and hot and dirty and tired .
waiter !
waiter !
you want it hot ?
scalding .
what is it ?
there' s only two rooms .
where will you put me ?
we' il put you right here .
what kind of a bed' s this ?
one of those collapsible things ?
you all right ?
wonderful , honey .
i don' t like a bed that gives much .
there' s no door between the two rooms .
will it be decent ?
stanley' s polish , you know .
something like irish , isn' t it ?
well ...
i bought some nice clothes to meet all your lovely friends in .
well , i' m afraid you won' t think they' re lovely .
i bought nice clothes and i' il wear them .
i guess you' re hoping i' il say i' il put up at a hotel .
but i' m not going to .
i must be near you .
i must be with people .
i can' t be alone ... ... because , as you must have noticed ... ... i' m not very well .
you do seem ...
will stanley like me or will i just be a visiting in law ?
i couldn' t stand that .
you' il get along fine .
try not to compare him ...
he was an officer ?
he was a master sergeant , decorated 4 times .
he had those on when you met him ?
i wasn' t just blinded by the brass .
i wasn' t ...
there were things to adjust myself to later on .
such as his ... civilian background ?
how' d he take the news i was coming ?
he' s on the road a good deal .
oh , he travels ?
good .
i mean , isn' t it ?
i can hardly stand it when he' s away for a night .
lf he' s away for a week , i go wild .
gracious !
when he comes back , cry on his lap like a baby .
i guess that' s what' s meant by being in love .
i haven' t asked the things you probably thought i would ... ... so i expect you to be understanding about what i have to tell you .
what ?
you' re going to reproach me .
i know you' re bound to , but before you do ... ... consider the fact that you left .
i stayed and struggled .
you came to new orleans .
i stayed at belle reve trying to hold it together .
i' m not meaning to reproach you ... ... but all the burden descended on me !
it was best i came here .
but you abandoned belle reve , not i.
i stayed and almost died for it !
tell me what happened !
i knew you' d take this attitude !
about what ?
please !
the loss .
the loss .
belle reve ?
lost , is it ?
yes .
but how did it go ?
what happened ?
you' re a fine one to ask me how it went !
to stand there accusing me of it !
i won' t stand it !
i !
i took the blows on my face and my body !
all of those deaths !
the long parade to the graveyard .
father , mother ... ... margaret , that dreadful way .
you just came home for the funerals .
and funerals are pretty compared to deaths .
how' d you think all that dying was paid for ?
death is expensive , miss stella .
and i , from my pitiful salary at the school .
yes , accuse me .
stare at me , thinking i let the place go !
i let the place go !
where were you ?
in there with your polack !
that' s enough !
oh , stella , stella , you' re crying !
does that surprise you ?
we playing at your house ?
no , my mother' s still sick .
you bring the beer .
break it up down there .
i made spaghetti and ate it myself !
now , honey ... ... told you we were playing .
you never phoned me once .
i told you at breakfast .
why don' t you just get in here .
do you want it in the newspapers ?
you must be stanley .
i' m blanche .
you' re stel' s sister .
yes .
hi ya .
where' s the little woman ?
in the bathroom .
where you from , blanche ?
i live in auriol .
auriol .
oh , yeah , that' s right .
auriol , that' s not my territory .
liquor goes fast in the hot weather .
want a shot ?
no , i rarely touch it .
there' s some people that rarely touch it , but it touches them often .
you mind if i make myself comfortable ?
please do . " be comfortable , " that' s my motto .
mine too .
it' s hard to stay looking fresh in hot weather .
i haven' t washed or even powdered and ... ... here you are .
you must be careful sitting in damp things .
catch cold .
especially when you been exercising hard , like bowling .
what do you do ?
you' re a teacher ?
yes .
what subject ?
english .
i never was a very good english student .
how long you here for ?
i don' t know yet .
shacking up here ?
i will if it' s not inconvenient for you .
good .
traveling wears me out .
take it easy .
what' s that ?
those cats .
what' d you do , fall asleep in there ?
i guess i' il strike you as being the unrefined type .
stella' s spoke a good deal about you .
she said you were married once .
said you were married once .
said you were married once .
yes .
when i was quite young .
what happened ?
what happened ?
the boy ...
the boy died .
i' m afraid ... ... i' m going to be sick .
fresh fish !
fish !
fresh fish !
looks like she' s fixing to stay awhile .
so , we playing tonight ?
maybe we ought to ...
don' t figure no maybes .
put it down .
right .
shall i get the other one ?
thanks , darling .
is stanley back with my trunk ?
yes .
honey ?
will you get my blue net for me ?
all right .
it was good of stanley to get my trunk .
he was glad to do it .
i' il see you later .
just don' t forget .
i' m taking blanche to galatoire' s for supper , then to a show ... ... because it' s poker night .
how about my supper ?
i' m not going to galatoire' s .
i put you a cold plate on ice .
we' il be back after the party' s over as i' m not sure how' il she' il take it .
isn' t that just dandy .
you better give me some money .
where is she ?
she' s soaking in a hot tub to quiet her nerves .
she' s terribly upset .
over what ?
she' s been through an ordeal .
we lost belle reve .
what , the place in the country ?
how ?
it had to be sacrificed .
when she comes in , say something nice about her appearance .
and ... ... don' t mention the baby .
i haven' t told her .
i' m waiting till she calms down .
and try to understand her and be nice to her , honey .
she wasn' t expecting such a place .
i tried to gloss things over a little in my letters .
admire her dress .
tell her she looks wonderful .
it' s important to blanche , her little weakness .
okay , i get the idea , but ... ... let' s just skip back to where you said the place was disposed of .
how about a few more details on that subject .
it' s best not to talk about it until she' s calmed down .
is that the deal ?
blanche can' t be annoyed with details right now ?
you saw how she was last night .
i saw how she was .
now , let' s see the bill of sale .
i haven' t seen any .
she didn' t show you no papers , no deed nor nothing ?
it seemed like it wasn' t sold .
was it given away to charity ?
she' il hear you .
i don' t care .
let' s see the papers .
there weren' t any .
she didn' t show any papers .
i don' t care about papers .
wait , listen .
have you heard of the napoleonic code ?
no , i haven' t heard of the napoleonic code .
let me enlighten you on a point or two .
that what belongs to the wife , belongs to the husband , and vice versa .
will you listen ?
for example , if i had that property ...
my head is swimming .
well , all right , then .
when she' s done soaking in the tub ... ... i' il inquire if she is acquainted with it .
stanley !
don' t be so silly !
it looks like you were swindled .
and , under the napoleonic code , i got swindled too .
i don' t like that .
you' ve no idea how ridiculous you' re being ... ... when you suggest my sister , or ... ... anyone else of our family , could have swindled anyone ...
come on , where' s the money if the place was sold ?
not sold !
lost !
lost !
come here .
open your eyes to this stuff here ?
she got this out of a teacher' s pay ?
oh , hush !
look at these fine feathers and furs that she preens herself in .
what is this article ?
a solid gold dress !
and this one here .
and what is that , a fox piece ?
a genuine fur fox , a half a mile long !
where are your fox pieces ?
bushy , snow white ones , no less !
where are your white fox furs ?
those are inexpensive furs blanche has had a long time .
an acquaintance deals in these items and he' s going to appraise this .
don' t be an idiot !
i' il bet you there' s $1000 invested in this stuff .
now , is that the treasure chest of a pirate ?
that' s pearls .
ropes of them .
is your sister a deep sea diver ?
where' re your pearls and gold bracelets ?
be still .
a diamond crown for an empress .
a rhinestone tiara she wore to a costume ball .
what is rhinestone ?
next door to glass .
an acquaintance works in a jewelry store .
he' il come to make an appraisal .
here' s your plantation .
you' re being stupid and horrid !
you stay away from these things before she comes out !
the kowalskis and dubois got a different notion on this .
indeed they have , thank heavens .
i' m going outside .
go ahead .
come out with me while blanche is getting dressed .
since when are you giving me orders ?
are you going to stay here and insult her ?
you bet your life i' m staying .
hello , stanley .
here i am , freshly bathed and scented and feeling like a new person .
that' s good .
will you excuse me while i put on my pretty new dress ?
go ahead .
i understand there' s to be a card party here tonight ... ... to which we ladies are cordially not invited .
that' s right .
where is stella ?
she' s out on the porch .
i' m going to ask a favor of you soon .
what' s that going to be , i wonder ?
some buttons in back .
you may enter .
how do i look ?
you look okay .
many thanks .
now , the buttons .
i can' t do no more with them .
you men with your big , clumsy fingers .
may i have a drag ?
have one for yourself .
thank you .
it looks like my trunk has exploded .
me and stella helped you unpack .
you did a fast and thorough job of it .
it looks like you' ve raided some stylish shops in paris .
clothes are my passion .
how much do furs like that cost ?
these were a tribute from an admirer .
he had a lot of admiration .
in my youth i excited some admiration , but look at me now .
will you think it' s possible that i was once considered attractive ?
your looks are okay .
i was fishing for a compliment .
i don' t go in for that .
what ?
compliments to women on their looks .
every dame knows if she' s good looking without being told .
some give themselves credit for more than they' ve got .
i once went out with a dame who said , " i' m the glamorous type .
she says , " i' m the glamorous type .
i says , " so what ?
what did she say then ?
nothing .
it shut her up .
did it end the romance ?
it ended the conversation .
that was all .
some men are took in by this hollywood glamour stuff , and some men just aren' t .
and you' re in the 2nd category .
that' s right .
i can' t imagine a woman bewitching you .
that' s right .
you' re simple , straightforward and honest .
a bit on the ... ... primitive side .
to interest you a woman would have to ...
she must lay the cards on the table .
i never did care for wishy washy people .
my sister has married a man .
that was all i could tell ...
how about cutting the re bop ? !
come with me while blanche dresses .
i' m done .
come out .
your sister and i are chatting .
do me a favor .
go to the store and get me a lemon coke with chipped ice .
will you do that for me , sweetie ?
please ?
all right .
the poor thing was listening to us .
i have an idea she doesn' t understand you as well as i do .
all right , let us proceed without any more digression .
i' m ready to answer all questions .
i' ve nothing to hide .
what is it ?
in the state of louisiana we' ve got what' s known as the napoleonic code .
according to which that what belongs to the wife belongs to her husband .
you have an impressive judicial air .
if you weren' t my wife' s sister , i' d get ideas about you .
such as what ?
don' t play so dumb .
you know what .
all right .
cards on the table .
i know i fib a good deal .
but a woman' s charm is 50 % illusion .
but when a thing is important , i tell the truth .
i never cheated my sister ... ... or you , or anyone else on earth as long as i lived !
where are the papers ?
everything i own is in that trunk .
what are you thinking ?
what' s in that little boy' s mind of yours ?
i' il do it , it' il be faster and simpler .
i keep my papers in this tin box .
what are those underneath ?
some love letters ... ... yellowing with antiquity .
all from one boy .
give them to me !
i' il just look .
your touch insults them .
don' t pull that stuff !
now that you' ve touched them , i' il burn them !
what are they ?
poems ... the dead boy wrote .
i hurt him the way that you would like to hurt me , but you can' t .
i' m no longer young and vulnerable .
my young husband was and i ...
never mind about that .
give them back to me .
what' d you mean , you have to burn them ?
i' m sorry .
i must have lost my head for a moment .
everyone has something they won' t let others touch ... ... because of their intimate nature .
ambler and ambler !
crabtree !
ambler and ambler !
what' s ambler and ambler ?
a firm that made loans on the place .
it was lost on a mortgage ?
it must have been .
i don' t want no ifs , ands , or buts !
where' s the rest ?
thousands of papers , stretching back over centuries , affect belle reve .
as piece by piece our improvident grandfathers exchanged the land ... ... for their epic debauches , to put it mildly .
finally all that was left , and stella can verify it ... ... was the house itself , and 20 acres of ground including a graveyard ... ... to which now all but stella and i have retreated .
here they are , all of them .
all papers .
i hereby endow you with them .
peruse them , commit them to memory .
it' s wonderfully fitting that belle reve ... ... should be this bunch of papers in big , capable hands .
i wonder if stella' s back with my coke ?
i got a lawyer acquaintance , we' il straighten this out .
present them to him with a box of aspirin tablets .
under the napoleonic code ... ... a man has to take an interest in his wife' s affairs .
especially now that she' s having a baby .
stella' s having a baby ?
i didn' t know she was having a baby .
oh , stella for a star !
how lovely to have a baby !
everything' s all right .
we thrashed it out .
i feel shaky , but i handled it nicely .
i treated it as a joke .
laughed , called him a boy and flirted .
yes , i was flirting with your husband .
the guests are arriving for the party .
i' m sorry he did that to you .
i guess he' s just not the type that goes for jasmine perfume .
maybe he' s what we need to mix with our blood since we' ve lost belle reve ... ... and have to go on without belle reve to protect us .
how pretty the sky is !
i ought to go there on a rocket that never comes down .
which way do we go now ?
this way ?
no , honey , this way .
the blind are leading the blind .
red hots !
go upstairs and tell her to stop that .
if i go up , i won' t come down .
forget it .
remember when she poured boiling water through the floor cracks ?
i gotta go home soon .
what do you say ?
no , i' m out .
every time you win a pot you' re out !
my mother doesn' t sleep until i come home .
what do you say ?
i' m going to wash up .
you tell them guys the kettle' s on the stove !
i' m going to break up the game .
wait .
let me powder .
i feel hot and frazzled .
do i look done in ?
you look fresh as a daisy .
one that' s been picked a few days .
why don' t somebody go to the chinaman' s and bring back chop suey ?
when i' m losing , you want to eat .
i see you are still at it .
where' ve you been ?
we went to a show .
this is mr. gonzales and mr. hubbell .
hello .
please , don' t get up .
no one' s getting up , don' t worry .
poker' s fascinating .
could i kibitz ?
you could not !
why don' t you go up to eunice' s ?
how long will you play ?
till we' re ready to quit !
wish you' d quit after the next hand .
hey , that' s my coat !
that' s not fun , stanley .
makes me mad when he does that in front of people .
i think i will bathe .
again ?
my nerves are in knots .
is it occupied ?
i don' t know .
good evening .
hello .
this is harold mitchell .
this is my sister , blanche dubois .
how do you do ?
how do you do , miss dubois ?
how' s your mother ?
she' s about the same , thanks .
she appreciated that custard .
excuse me , please .
excuse me .
that one seems superior to the others .
does he ?
he had a sort of sensitive look .
his mother' s sick .
is he married ?
is he a wolf ?
why , blanche !
no , i don' t think he would be .
what does he do ?
he' s on the precision bench in the spare parts department ... ... the plant stanley travels for .
is that something much ?
stanley' s the only one likely to get anywhere .
flush , win !
blanche , you' re standing in the light !
am i ?
gracious !
you should see their wives !
i can imagine .
big , beefy things , i suppose .
you know that one upstairs ?
hey , you hens !
cut out that cackling in there !
you can' t hear us !
you can hear me and i said , hush up !
this is my house and i' il talk as much as i want to !
don' t start a row .
he' s half drunk .
i' il be out in a minute .
50 cents .
all right .
see you .
well , steve ?
i' m out .
two bucks .
what do you say ?
come on , are you in ?
i' m out !
who turned that on in there ?
i did .
do you mind ?
turn it off !
let the girls have music .
sounds good .
there you are !
i didn' t hear you name it !
didn' t i name it ?
i wasn' t listening .
what were you doing ?
looking through the drapes .
i wasn' t .
we' re dealing this hand over again .
play cards , or quit .
deal me out !
this game' il be spit in the ocean .
hello .
excuse me .
the little boy' s room is occupied right now .
excuse me .
have you got any cigs ?
sure .
what a pretty case .
silver ?
yes .
read the inscription .
there is an inscription .
why , i can' t make it out .
and if god choose ... ... i shall but love thee better after death .
that' s from my favorite sonnet by mrs. browning .
you know it !
certainly .
there' s a story connected with this inscription .
a romance ?
a sad one .
the girl' s dead now .
she knew she was dying when she give me this .
strange , sweet girl .
she must have been very fond of you .
sick people have deep , sincere attachments .
they do .
sorrow makes for sincerity , i think .
it brings it out .
the little there is belongs to people who have known sorrow .
i believe you' re right .
i' m positive .
deal me out .
i' m talking to miss ...
dubois .
it' s a french name , meaning , " woods .
and blanche means " white . " so the two together mean , " white woods .
like an orchard in spring .
you can remember it by that ... ... if you care to .
you are stella' s sister , are you not ?
stella' s my precious little sister .
i call her " little " though she' s older than i am .
just slightly .
less than a year .
will you do something for me ?
yes .
what ?
i bought this adorable paper lantern at a chinese shop .
put it over the light bulb , will you ?
i' d be glad to .
i can' t stand a naked light bulb anymore than i can a rude remark ... ... or a vulgar action .
i guess we strike you as being a pretty rough bunch .
i' m very adaptable ... ... to circumstances .
that' s a good way to be .
you' re not ...
married ?
oh , no , no !
i' m an old maid teacher .
you may be a teacher , but you' re certainly not an old maid .
why , thank you , sir .
i appreciate your gallantry .
so you' re in the teaching profession ?
grade school or high school ?
coming !
gracious , what lung power !
i teach high school in auriol .
what subject do you teach ?
guess .
i bet you teach art or music .
of course , i could be wrong .
you might teach math .
never math , sir .
never math .
i have the misfortune of being an english instructor .
i try to instill a bunch of bobby soxers and drugstore romeos ... ... with a reverence for hawthorne and whitman and poe .
i bet they are more interested in other things .
how very right you are .
their literary heritage is not what they treasure above all .
but they' re sweet things .
in spring , it' s touching to see them making their first discovery of love .
as if nobody had ever known it ... ... before .
sorry .
excuse me !
have you finished ?
oh , yes .
i have .
wait .
i' il turn on the radio .
turn on the light now .
oh , look !
we' ve made enchantment .
3 bullets , moustache !
straight !
i got you !
what are you doing ?
let me alone !
drunk !
you animal thing !
get out !
get out !
what' re you doing ?
get out .
my sister' s going to have a baby !
lunacy !
complete lunacy !
you come up to my place .
did he hurt you ?
make him go away !
poker shouldn' t be played around women .
take it easy , will you ?
get him in that shower !
come on .
get his feet , will you ?
grab his feet .
come on .
come on , get under there .
stay .
get under there .
get him a little higher , that' s right .
how you feel ?
there you are .
wake up .
we should remove his clothes .
what' re you doing ? !
poker should not be played around women !
where' s steve ?
take it easy !
honey ?
where are you ?
hey , baby !
you can sleep over here .
blanche can have steve' s place .
he ain' t coming home if he knows what' s good for him .
look !
she ain' t coming down and she ain' t going to talk to you neither .
stop hollering and go to bed .
i want my girl .
shut up , or you' il get the law on you .
you can' t beat up a woman then call her back .
she ain' t coming .
they' il haul you in like last time !
i want my girl down here .
you stinker !
i wouldn' t mix in this !
please , don' t ever leave me , baby .
come back !
miss dubois ?
all quiet along the potomac now ?
she ran down and went back in with him .
sure , she did .
i' m terrified .
don' t be .
they' re crazy about each other .
shame it happened your first day .
violence is so ...
sit down and have a cigarette with me .
why , i' m not properly dressed .
that doesn' t matter here .
such a pretty silver case .
i showed you the inscription , didn' t i ?
there' s so much ... ... so much confusion in the world .
thank you for being so kind .
i need kindness now .
bananas !
bananas !
oh , my baby .
my baby sister !
what' s the matter with you ?
he' s left ?
will he be back ?
he' s getting the car greased .
i' ve been half crazy .
how could you come back last night ?
please , he was as good as a lamb when i came back .
he' s really very ashamed of himself .
and that makes it all right ?
stanley' s always smashed things .
on our wedding night , as soon as we came in here ... ... he snatched off my slipper and rushed around smashing light bulbs .
he did what ?
he smashed all the light bulbs with the heel of my slipper .
and you let him , didn' t run ?
i was sort of thrilled by it .
eunice and you had breakfast ?
do you suppose i wanted any breakfast ?
you' re so matter of fact about it all , stella .
well , what other can i be ?
he took the radio to get it fixed .
it didn' t land on the pavement so only one tube smashed .
and you stand there smiling ?
what should i do ?
face the facts .
what are they , in your opinion ?
you' re married to a madman .
i have a plan for us both to get out of here .
stop taking it for granted that i want to get out .
i take for granted you have sufficient memory of belle reve ... ... to find it impossible to live here .
you take too much for granted .
i can' t believe you .
i understand how it happened .
you saw him first in uniform , an officer , not here ...
that doesn' t make any difference .
we' re talking about his desire .
his brutal desire .
the name of that streetcar that bangs through the quarter .
up one narrow street and down another .
have you ever ridden on that streetcar ?
it brought me here ... ... where i' m not wanted .
where i' m ashamed to be .
isn' t your superior attitude a little out of place ?
a man like that .
i love him !
i tremble for you .
i can' t help your trembling if you insist on trembling .
may i speak plainly ?
yes , do .
go ahead .
as plainly as you want .
if you' il forgive me ... ... he' s common .
yes , i suppose he is .
suppose ?
you can' t have forgotten that much of our upbringing ... ... that you suppose there' s any part of a gentleman in his nature .
you' re hating me saying this , aren' t you ?
go on .
say it all , blanche .
he' s like an animal .
he has an animal' s habits .
there' s something subhuman about him .
thousands of years have passed him by and there he is ... ... stanley kowalski , survivor of the stone age ... ... bearing the raw meat home from the kill in the jungle .
you wait .
maybe he' il strike you ... or grunt , kiss you ... ... if kisses have been discovered .
his poker night , you call it .
his party of apes ?
maybe we are a long way from being made in god' s image ... ... but , stella , my sister ... ... there' s been progress since then .
such things as art , as poetry , as music .
in some kinds of people , some tenderer feelings have had a little beginning ... ... that we must make grow and cling to ... ... and hold as our flag in this march toward whatever it is we' re approaching .
don' t , don' t hang back with the brutes !
hi ya .
is blanche back yet ?
yeah , she' s back .
oh , hi there , blanche .
looks like you got under the car .
that jerk mechanic down at fritz' s doesn' t know grease from 3rd base .
don' t throw that thing at me !
i can fix things .
just what i gave your brother .
i' il call the police .
he hit me .
i' m calling the police .
you saw !
your sister' s friends have stayed in the city awhile .
did eunice get the police ?
no , she' s getting a drink .
that' s much more practical .
blanche is making us new slipcovers .
is she here ?
she went to the four deuces .
that no good , rotten ...
i can' t find my other pair of shoes .
we cleaned in there .
i' il get them .
i can' t find nothing around this dump anymore .
what sign were you born under ?
what sign ?
astrological sign .
i bet you were born under aries .
aries people are forceful , dynamic .
they dote on noise .
they love to bang things around .
stanley was born five minutes after christmas .
capricorn .
the goat !
say ... ... do you know somebody named shaw ?
everybody knows someone by the name of shaw .
this somebody named shaw believes he met you in auriol .
but i figure he must of mixed you up with someone else because this party ... ... he met at a hotel called the flamingo .
i guess he does have me mixed up with this other party .
the hotel flamingo is not a place i' d dare to be seen in .
you know it then ?
i' ve seen it ... ... and smelled it .
you must' ve got close to smell it .
the odor of cheap perfume is penetrating .
you use expensive stuff ?
$12 an ounce .
i' m nearly out ... ... if you want to remember ...
i figure that he must of got you mixed up .
but he goes in and out of auriol all the time ... ... so he can check and clear up any mistake .
see you at the four deuces .
don' t i rate a kiss ?
not in front of your sister .
don' t cry .
i only do that with other girls because i love you , baby .
it' s a fact .
you still scared of thunder ?
what' ve you heard about me ?
what have people been telling you ... ... about me ?
telling ?
you haven' t heard any ... ... unkind gossip about me ?
why , no , blanche .
of course not .
honey ... ... there was quite a lot of talk ... ... in auriol .
people talk , who cares ?
i haven' t been so good the last year or so ... ... since belle reve began slipping away .
we all do things .
i was never hard enough .
soft people ... ... have got to court the favor of hard ones .
they must shimmer and glow .
how much longer i can turn the trick ?
it isn' t enough to be soft .
you must be soft ... ... and attractive .
and i ...
i' m fading now .
have you been listening to me ?
i never listen when you' re being morbid .
is that for me ?
not for anyone else .
you precious lamb .
is it just a coke ?
you want a shot in it ?
a shot never did a coke any harm .
let me .
you mustn' t wait on me .
i like to wait on you .
makes it seem more like home .
i have to admit ... ... i love to be waited on .
honey , what is it ?
you' re so good to me and i ...
i know you hate me to talk sentimental but believe me , i feel more than i say .
i won' t stay long .
i promise .
now , blanche .
i' il go .
i' il go soon .
i won' t hang around till he throws me out !
now will you stop talking foolish ?
watch how you pour it .
heavens .
right on my ... ... pretty pink skirt .
use my hankie .
blot gently .
i know .
gently .
gently .
gently .
did it stain ?
no , not a bit .
isn' t that lucky ?
honey , why did you scream like that ?
why ?
i don' t know why .
mitch is coming at seven .
i' m nervous about our relations .
he hasn' t gotten anything more than a good night kiss .
i want his respect .
men don' t want things they get easily .
men lose interest quickly , especially when a girl ... ... is over 30 .
when i mentioned marriage ... ... they even forgot where i lived ...
so , you see , i haven' t informed him of my real age .
honey , why are you so sensitive about your age ?
because of ... ... hard knocks my ...
