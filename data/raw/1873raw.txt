# i wanted to be with you alone

# you keep your distance with a system of touch

there would be headlines in the papers .
the grown up gangs who ran the betting at the wrestling and the barrow boys
would hear with respect of how 0ld misery' s house had been destroyed .
it was as though this plan had been with him all his life , pondered through the seasons ,
now , in his 15th year , crystallised with the pain of puberty .
what is graham greene trying to communicate with this passage ?
why did the children break into 0ld misery' s house ?
joanie ?
they wanted to rob him .
if you had actually read the short story , which was a whopping 13 pages , you' d know that the children find a great deal of money in the mattress , but burn it .
donnie darko , perhaps with your recent brush with mass destruction , you can give us your opinion .
they say it when they flood the house , when they tear it to shreds , that destruction is a form of creation , so burning the money is ironic .
they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart .
they want to change things .
may we help you ?
yeah , i just registered .
they put me in the wrong class .
you look like you belong here .
um ...
where do i sit ?
sit next to the boy you think is the cutest .
quiet !
let her choose .
joanie , get up .
what people don' t understand is that dukakis does not have the financial infrastructure ...
well , the construction guys say it will take about a week to fix the roof .
airline better not fuck us on the shingle match .
they still don' t know ?
know what ?
where it came from ?
0h , no .
they can' t tell us .
something about a matching serial number that got burned .
i had to sign a form saying i wouldn' t talk to anyone about it .
so we can' t tell anyone what nobody knows ?
yeah .
but you tell ...
what' s your doctor' s name ?
dr thurman , dad .
yes .
tell dr thurman whatever you want .
dad .
what ?
dad !
0h ... !
what' s that woman doing in the middle of the damn road ? !
no mail today .
maybe tomorrow .
what did she say to you ?
i made a new friend .
real or imaginary ?
imaginary .
would you like to talk about this friend ?
frank .
frank .
what did he say ?
he said to follow him .
follow him ?
where ?
into the future .
and then what happens ?
and then he said ... then he said that the world was coming to an end .
do you think the world is coming to an end ?
no .
that' s stupid .
for my entire life , i was a victim of my own fear .
love .
i was feeding fear with food .
fear .
finally , i looked in the mirror .
not just in the mirror .
i looked through the mirror .
ln that image , i saw my ego reflection .
for two years , i thought it was normal for a 10 year old to wet the bed ...
shh !
quiet !
but the solution was there all the time .
l' m not afraid any more !
all over america , people have come together to join hands .
people who believe that human life is absolutely too important , too valuable and too precious to be controlled by fear .
pay close attention .
you could miss something .
hello .
my name is jim cunningham .
and welcome to " controlling fear " .
.. and the prince was led into a world of strange and beautiful magic .
wow .
the last unicorn " by samantha darko .
give it back !
" there was once a unicorn named ariel ...
you wrinkled it .
it' s not wrinkled , sam .
it' s 7 . 45 .
the bus should' ve been here 20 minutes ago .
maybe martha finally went nuts and hijacked it .
there' s this rule at 7 . 45 , we get to go home .
there' s no rule .
cherita , you should ... go home .
yeah , if you' re here when the bus comes , we' il get in trouble .
shut up !
" shut up !
hey , porky pig ... i hope you get molested .
hey !
hey !
i can' t believe this !
school' s closed today because it' s flooded .
no way !
yeah .
holy shit !
that' s the best news ever !
my god , is this ever going to stop ?
eventually , yes .
but right now , i got 12 classrooms full of water .
all coming from a busted water main .
what else ?
what else ?
principal cole , i' il show you what else .
that' s unbelievable .
that' s solid bronze , isn' t it ?
yep .
how did this happen ?
i heard a cat burglar trashed everything and the mongrel got his head cut off .
hah !
true !
beth' s mom said the boys ' locker room flooded and they found faeces everywhere .
what are faeces ?
baby mice .
hey .
has anyone ever told you that you' re sexy ?
i like your boobs .
hey .
hey .
school' s cancelled .
do you want to walk me home ?
sure .
don' t look so freaked .
i' m not .
check your backpack .
those guys steal shit .
fuck ' em !
so , why' d you move here ?
my parents got a divorce .
my mom got a restraining order against my stepdad .
he has emotional problems .
i have those , too .
what kind does he have ?
he stabbed my mom four times in the chest .
0h .
did he go to jail ?
no , he fled .
they still can' t find him .
mom and i had to change our names .
i thought gretchen ross was pretty cool .
i was in jail once .
i mean ...
i burned down this house .
it was abandoned , but i got held back in school and i can' t drive till i' m 21 .
but i' m over all of that .
i' m ... painting and stuff .
writing .
i want to be a writer .
maybe a painter .
maybe both ...
i' il write a book and draw the pictures .
then maybe people will understand me .
i don' t know , change things .
donnie darko what the hell kind of name is that ?
it' s like a superhero or something .
what makes you think i' m not ?
i should go .
for physics , montinoff is having me write this essay the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind .
it' s monnitoff .
but that' s easy .
antiseptics .
like , the whole sanitation thing .
joseph lister , 1895 .
before antiseptics , there was no sanitation , especially in medicine .
you mean soap ?
well , i' m really glad school was flooded today .
why is that ?
we' d never have had this conversation .
you' re weird .
sorry .
no , that was a compliment .
well , look , uh ...
you want to go with me ?
where do you want to go ?
no , i mean , like , " go " with me .
you know , like " going together " .
sure .
0k .
where are you going ?
i' m going home .
stupid ...
where are you going ?
i' d like to try something new .
have you ever been hypnotised ?
no .
when i clap twice , you will wake up .
do you understand ?
yes .
so , tell me about your week .
i met a girl .
what is her name ?
gretchen .
we' re going together now .
do you still think about girls a lot ?
yeah .
how are things going at school ?
i think about girls a lot .
i asked you about school , donnie .
i think about fucking a lot during school .
what else do you think about during school ?
" married with children " .
you think about your family ?
i just turn down the volume and think about fucking christina applegate .
i asked you about your family .
no .
i don' t think about fucking my family .
that' s gross .
i' d like to hear about your friend frank .
sam bylan .
cherita chen .
donald darko .
daye dennis .
hey , you fuck !
did you say i flooded the school ?
i didn' t say shit .
yeah , well , they think i did it .
if you' re innocent , then you have nothing to worry about , right ?
fuck you !
you know what i think ?
i think you did it .
beer and pussy that' s all i need .
we gotta find ourselves a smurfette .
smurfette ?
mm hm .
not some tight ass middlesex chick .
like , this cute little blonde that' il get down with the guys like smurfette does .
smurfette doesn' t fuck .
that' s bullshit .
why do you think papa smurf made her ?
because the other smurfs were getting too horny .
not vanity .
i heard he was a homosexual .
then she fucks them while vanity watches .
what about papa smurf ?
he must get some action ?
what he does , he films the gang bang .
later on , he beats off to the tape .
first of all , papa smurf didn' t create smurfette .
gargamel did .
she was sent as gargamel' s evil spy to destroy the smurf village , but the overwhelming goodness of the smurfs transformed her .
and as for the whole gang bang scenario , it just couldn' t happen !
smurfs are asexual .
they don' t even have reproductive organs under those little pants .
that' s what' s so illogical about being a smurf .
what' s the point of living if you don' t have a dick ?
donnie , why you gotta get smart on us ?
grandma death .
excuse me !
excuse me !
please stay off the road , miss sparrow , or i will call social services .
i hate that miss farmer .
she' s such a fucking bitch !
yeah .
how old is grandma death ?
101 .
she does the same thing every day .
just walks back and forth and back and forth to the mailbox .
nothing ever in there .
0h , wait , wait , wait ...
she' s going back to the box .
we may still have mail .
mail , mail , mail .
here it is .
this could be it .
0h ... ?
0h , no dice , grandma .
sorry .
someone ought to write that bitch .
authorities continued their search for a suspect in the middlesex ridge school vandalism .
the private school has asked for donations to restore its beloved mascot , known only as the mongrel ...
it' s very helpful .
there' s a good turnout tonight .
what are you trying to accomplish here ?
there was urine and faeces flooded in my office .
whatever fits .
whatever fits " ?
in cooperation with the county police , we have begun an active investigation into the cause of the flooding .
and our suspects include several of our own students ...
i want to know why this filth is being taught to our children .
kitty , i would appreciate if you would wait ...
dr cole , not only am i a teacher , but i am also a parent of a middlesex child .
therefore i am the only person here who transcends the parent teacher bridge .
don' t worry .
you got away with it .
i have in my hand graham greene' s " the destructors " .
this short story is part of my daughter' s english assignment .
in this story , several children destroy an elderly man' s house from inside out .
how can you do that ?
and how do they do this ?
they flood the house by breaking through a water main .
l can do anything i want .
and so can you .
and i think that this garbage should be removed !
excuse me .
what is the real issue here ?
the pta doesn' t ban books .
the pta must acknowledge that pornography is being taught in our curriculum !
it' s meant to be ironic .
excuse me .
go back to grad school .
why did you make me flood the school ?
they are in great danger .
do you even know who graham greene is ?
i think we have all seen " bonanza " .
well , um ... while we are on other topics ...
where do you come from ?
do you believe in time travel ?
who are you talking to ?
i was just taking my pills , sam .
a storm is coming , frank says .
a storm that will swallow the children ,
and i will deliver them from the kingdom of pain .
i' il deliver them back to their doorsteps , send the monsters back to the underground .
i' il send them back to a place where no one else can see them .
except for me .
because i am donnie darko .
who is frank ?
a six foot tall bunny rabbit .
ln these modern times , our attitude and beliefs are so delicate , so fragile .
l have had a cunning vision .
this vision has released me .
lt' s important that our lifeline be rejuvenated , so that we can breathe again .
lt' s time to breathe .
lt is time to breathe .
thank you , jim cunningham .
thank you , jim cunningham .
so now let us begin lifeline exercise number one .
please press stop now .
as you can see , the lifeline is divided into two polar extremes .
fear and love .
fear is in the negative energy spectrum .
love is in the positive energy spectrum .
no , duh
excuse me ?
no , duh " is a product of fear .
now , on each card is a character dilemma which applies to the lifeline .
please ...
take this .
thank you .
please read each character dilemma aloud and place an " x " on the lifeline in the appropriate place .
cherita ?
juanita has an important math test today .
she' s known about the test for several weeks , but has not studied .
in order to keep from failing , juanita decides to cheat on the math test .
good .
good .
very good .
mr darko .
ling ling finds a wallet filled with money .
she takes it to the address on the driver' s licence but keeps the money .
i' m sorry , miss farmer .
i don' t get this .
just place an " x " in the appropriate place .
i know what to do , but you can' t lump things into two categories .
the lifeline is divided that way .
well , life isn' t that simple .
i mean ...
who cares if ling ling keeps the money ?
it has nothing to do with fear or love .
they are the deepest human emotions .
0k .
but you' re not listening to me .
there are other things to take into account , the whole spectrum of human emotion .
you can' t just lump everything into two categories and deny everything else !
if you don' t complete the assignment , you' il get a zero .
donald , let me preface this by saying that your iowa test scores are ... intimidating .
so ...
let' s go over this again .
what exactly did you say to miss farmer ?
i' il tell you .
he asked me to forcibly insert the lifeline exercise card into my anus !
nobody cares about responsibility , morality , family values ...
kitty ...
excuse us , please .
they' ve suspended him from after school activities for six months .
since this jet engine fiasco , i don' t know what' s gotten into ...
i' il say this because our daughters are on the dance team together and i respect you , but after witnessing your son' s behaviour , i have significant doubts about your ...
0ur paths through life must be righteous .
go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son doesn' t succumb to the path of fear .
do you remember that weird gym teacher , mrs farmer ?
yeah .
0k , well , my brother told her to shove a book up her ass today .
and then my parents just bought him all this new shit .
yeah , i know .
i wish a jet engine would fall on my room .
dr monnitoff .
donnie .
um ...
i know this is gonna sound kind of weird , but do you know anything about ... time travel ?
a wormhole with an einstein rosen bridge , which is theoretically a wormhole in space controlled by man .
so , according to hawking , a wormhole may be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space time .
so to travel back in time , you have to have a spaceship faster than the speed of light .
theoretically .
and be able to find a wormhole .
the basic principles of time travel are there .
your vessel and portal .
your vessel can be anything .
like a delorean ?
metal craft of any kind .
you know , i love that movie .
it' s so ... like , futuristic , you know ?
listen , um ... don' t tell anybody that i gave you this .
woman who wrote this used to teach here .
she was a nun long before that .
then overnight she became this entirely different person .
she up and left the church , wrote this book ...
she started teaching science , right here at middlesex .
the philosophy 0f time travel " .
roberta sparrow ?
that' s right .
roberta sparrow ?
roberta sparrow .
grandma death .
it' s called " the philosophy 0f time travel " .
what does philosophy have to do with it ?
guess who wrote it .
who ?
roberta sparrow .
huh !
she wrote a book .
grandma death wrote a book .
that' s a terrible nickname .
we almost ran her down the other day .
she lives in that piece of crap house , and you know she' s loaded .
you' re right .
she was known for her gem collection .
kids used to go up there all the time and try to steal stuff from her .
she became a total recluse .
huh !
i didn' t know she was alive till we damn near knocked her down .
she was just standing in the road , frozen .
l walked over to see if she was ok .
and she whispered in my ear .
what did she say ?
i think frank wants me to talk to her .
he asked if i knew about time travel .
she wrote a book about it , so that can' t be a coincidence , right ?
what did she say to you ?
she said that every living creature on earth dies alone .
how did that make you feel ?
it reminded me of my dog callie .
she died when i was eight and she crawled underneath the ... the porch .
to die .
to be alone .
do you feel alone right now ?
i don' t know ...
i' d like to believe i' m not , but i just ...
i' ve just never seen any proof , so i just don' t debate it any more .
i could spend my whole life debating it over and over and still wouldn' t have proof , so i just don' t debate it any more .
it' s absurd .
the search for god is absurd ?
it is if everyone dies alone .
does that scare you ?
i don' t want to be alone .
and his tapes have made me realise that for the last 39 years , i have been a prisoner of my own fear .
fear .
you have got to meet this jim cunningham .
i can' t believe he' s single .
it has been a disappointing night for these super bowl champions .
you' re right , dan .
coach joe gibbs is on the sidelines .
he' s gotta be thinking , " what happened ?
what went wrong tonight ?
and here' s the kick .
0h !
lt' s no good ...
shit , we need a quarterback .
we need a miracle .
we need to go for a safety .
what the future holds for this mvp , we' il have to wait and see .
you guys want anything ?
this week on " who' s the boss ?
samantha borrows tony' s van and gets caught without a licence .
better make sure we don' t miss that one .
here we are again .
fourth down now ...
tomorrow , we meet our partners for the young inventors ' fair .
what if you could go back in time and take those hours of pain and replace them with something better ?
like images ?
yeah , a hawaiian sunset or the grand canyon .
things that remind you how beautiful ...
we' ve been going together for two weeks .
yeah ?
well , i er ...
i ...
you want to kiss me ?
i' m sorry , i ...
look , donnie , wait .
i just ...
well , i like you a lot .
i just want it to be at a time when ... it ...
when what ?
when it reminds me just ...
when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be ?
yeah .
and there' s some fat guy staring at us .
i don' t think telling any woman to forcibly insert an object up her anus is something that should go without consequence .
i think we should buy him a moped .
i think we should get a divorce .
you won' t tell mom , will you ?
why would i ?
you tell mom everything .
no , i don' t .
let me see it .
no , it' s not finished .
it' s ... 0k .
it' s cool .
that' s scary .
you think ?
thank you for seeing us at such late notice .
we both felt we should come and discuss ...
what i think is going on with your son .
yes .
um ...
well , he' s er ...
you know about his past , and he was suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher .
i' m not sure that' s a good example .
i think he had just cause .
rose , let me lay out what i believe is happening here .
donnie' s aggressive behaviour ... his increased detachment from reality , seem to stem from his inability to cope with the forces in the world that he perceives to be threatening .
has he ever told you about frank ?
frank ?
yes , the giant bunny rabbit .
the what ?
i don' t recall him ever having mentioned a rabbit .
donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination .
this is a common occurrence among paranoid schizophrenics .
what can we do ?
i would like to do more hypnotherapy ... .. and increase his medication .
whatever will help him , really , is ...
that' s why we' re here .
we just would like him to experience some relief .
so if you think that more medication will do that , then i think we should give it a try .
it' s complicated .
yeah ?
there' s like a force in your brain that just sends you someplace .
do you go someplace familiar ?
no , but each time i keep waking up farther from my house .
scary .
donnie darko .
i know .
good morning , you mongrels !
good morning .
is that all you can muster ?
good morning !
good morning !
now , that' s a tiny , tiny bit better .
but i still sense some students who are actually afraid to say " good morning " .
good morning !
yeah , that' s what i like to hear !
too many young men and women today are completely paralysed by their fears .
they surrender their bodies to the temptation and destruction of drugs , alcohol and premarital sex .
now , i' m going to tell you a little story today .
it' s a heartbreakingly sad story about a young man whose life was completely destroyed by these instruments of fear ,
