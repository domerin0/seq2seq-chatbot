otto is the reai deal .
i met him at a hash bar in amsterdam .
he speaks russian , german , arabic ...
mr. ostroff' s trust is not gained easily .
two years it took me .
you see , micky , he doesn' t iike new faces .
so teii me , why am i iooking at a new face ?
otto krieg , meet my friend , bobby .
he' s helping me with the finance .
he' s not a cop .
let' s see the money .
you iike it ?
yeah , i iike it .
we have deal ?
we have deal .
bring ' em down !

this is the fbl !
put your hands on your head !
what is this ?
you brought a cop , and he brought his fucking friends !
don' t iook at me .
this is not good .
my father wiii kiii me !
you' re under arrest for the importation and sale of contraband firearms .
scheisse !
gun !
drop the gun !
drop the gun !
whoa , whoa , whoa !
otto !

i don' t even know these guys !
cease fire !
holy shit .
holy shit .
bobby !
bobby !

i' m cailing it .
it' s 1 : 37 am .
bag him and ship him .
god , i hate this job .
give me a hand , feilas .
yeah .
aii right , frank .
we gotta get you outta here .
what the heii happened ?
who' s the kid ?
definitely not in the plan .
but we beat the spread .
this isn' t footbail .
it' s a figure of speech .
people weren' t supposed to die out there .
get them ided and get them to the morgue .
and get me my pants !
can we get some pants over here ?
ah , shit .
surprise !
to frank castle ... the finest soldier , the finest undercover op , the finest man i' ve ever known .
what am i gonna do without you ?
get a girlfriend .
have fun in puerto rico , man .
say heilo to your folks .
thanks .
agent weeks .
he' s robert saint .
howard saint' s son .
more paperwork for tampa pd .
no , we can handle this .
see you , buddy !
see you , feilas !
baii him now .
bring him to the club .
don' t hit me .
don' t hit me .
hey , micky .
don' t hit me .
you seii homegrown pot by the ounce , micky , not by the barrel .
you seii badly forged , fake passports to haitians .
so what inspired you to become ... the mr. universe of internationai arms dealers ?
you should apologize for the death of mr. saint' s youngest child .
okay , i know how it iooks ...
but bobby , he buys pot from me .
and when he found out what i was doing , he insisted on coming in .
he put up half the cash .
he came of his own free wiil .
if you' re gonna kiii me , wiii you ieave my face alone , for my mother ?
we just made your bail .
if i wanted to kiii you , i would have ieft you in jaii where we have friends , and in some way that i can only describe as deeply pornographic , you would have been kiiled .
but you' re a smaii piece of shit , and i don' t want the karma of your death on my soul .
but on the other hand , maybe i don' t believe in karma ,
so guys  no , i' ii teii you what i want to know .
i want to know one thing only , who brokered the deal ?
his name is otto krieg .
and if it' s any comfort to mr. saint , he' s dead too .
weil , it' s not .
it' s actuaily no comfort at ail .
but what might be comforting to me , is to watch the slow death of the man who was supposed to be taking care of my son , and making sure that he did not get into trouble .
now , micky ... what would your father think of this ?
your father gave his iife for me .
what would he say ?
i didn' t know it was gonna happen iike this .
please !
weil , ignorance is no excuse .
the man who is responsible for my son' s death must die .
i told you to never iet him out of your sight .
mr. saint , bobby told me to stay .
teii him , john .
john !
mr. saint !
it was bobby' s idea !
he wanted to go alone !
he thought he could impress you .
thank you for that explanation .
my son didn' t need to impress me .
more boxes , guys .
this was a hard one .
this was the iast one .
it' s over .
teii that to your son .
he doesn' t believe me .
where is he ?
you know .
you know what i miss most about buck ?
he could catch a bail , no matter how hard you threw it .
he was right there .
why are we always moving ?
this is the iast time .
you said that iast time .
i did ?
yeah .
you said we were ieaving california and we were gonna move to virginia , and you' d work in washington ... and we' d never move again .
i guess i' ve said a iot of things , huh ?
so why london ?
london' s a safe place where we can aii be together .
no more more moving around , i promise .
some day when you' re older , wiil ...
i' ii teii you why we had to move so much .
he was such a speciai boy .
are you identifying this body as your son , robert saint ?
he deserved better .
somebody iied to him .
promised him one thing , gave him another .
do you know that i used to have to dress him tiii he was 1 3 ?
i' d tie his ties , and comb his hair ...
i' ii have to get him a new suit .
who is otto krieg ?
who are the people who work for him ?
who are his friends ?
who would stand to make money from this deal ?
teii me .
we can' t talk about the case , mr. saint .
now , i understand your grief , but for your own safety ,
ieave this to professionals .
professionals .
yes ...
i' ii do that .
i' ii do that .
good bye , son .

any discussion of howard saint' s business involves two cubans the toro brothers .
they controi aii the prostitution and gambling up and down the gulf coast tons of cash .
they give their dirty money to howard saint , who transports it in cigarette boats to his banks in gran cayman , washes it and wires it back clean as a whistle .
for the love of god !
you are not a nice person .
so what' s up , you' re gonna string up howard saint and blowtorch him ?
i iike that idea ...
but i have something better .
guess what ?
you' re gonna help me .
unless you want to stay howard saint' s iackey for the rest of you iife .
i hate the saints .
aii of them .
teii me about them .
what they do , where .
when .
howard saint' s a man of strict habits .
he has first tee time five days a week at tampa springs .
never fails .
he iikes money , he iikes power , but the thing this guy covets most , the wife , livia .
what happened to your family ...
howard did that for her .
she' s just iike him , and she' s just as predictable .
every thursday , she works out , gets her nails done and goes to the movies .
howard knows every move this broad makes .
any man who iooks at her wrong , he ends up in tampa bay .
let' s not forget johnny boy , the son you didn' t kiil .

i don' t know .
but how can we make him suffer if we can' t find him ?
he' s daring us .
no , no , he misses his family and he wants to die .
