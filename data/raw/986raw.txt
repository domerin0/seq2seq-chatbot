happy gllmore
my name is happy gilmore .
ever since i was old enough to skate , i loved hockey .
i wasnt reaily the greatest skater .
but that didnt keep my dad from teaching me ... ... the secret of making a great slap shot .
my dad worshipped hockey .
my mom didnt .
so she moved to egypt , where theres not a hockey rink within 1500 miles .
dad took me to games to see our favorite player ... ... terry oreiily , " the tasmanian devil " .
he wasnt a big guy , but he feared nobody , just iike me .
handsome feilow , huh ?
he said when i grew up , i could be anything .
but aii i ever wanted to be was a hockey player .
my childhood was going great , but iife is fuii of surprises .
after the funeral , i was sent to iive with my grandma in waterbury .
i was nervous , since i didnt know her that weil .
she dressed iike gene simmons from klss to cheer me up .
shes the sweetest person in the world .
after my dad died , i developed a short fuse .
that kid stole my party blower .
instead of asking for it back , i hit him in the head repeatedly ... with a hammer .
most of the time , i was quick to say i was sorry .
years iater , i played junior hockey and stiii hold two ieague records ... ... most time spent in a penalty box ... ... and i was the only guy to ever try to stab someone with his skates .
after i graduated , i had a iot of different jobs .
i was a road worker ... ... a janitor ...
... a security guard ...
... a gas station attendant ...
... and a plumber .
lately , ive been working construction .
its not bad .
im a good shot with a naii gun .
but one day my boss , mr. larson , got in the way .
apparently , he also has a short fuse .
look at the monster .
he got in a few iucky punches , but i feei i won the fight .
anyway , those jobs werent for me .
i was put on this planet for one reason to play hockey .
its my puck , baby !
dont you ever touch my puck !
is that gilmore again ?
how many times has he tried out ?
at ieast ten times .
he has a iot of intensity .
not a strong skater , though .
nor the best puck handler .
but , my god ...
what a shot .
it that goai regulation size or what ? !
number one ... ... number fifty two ... number sixteen ...
they saw my power .
they wont dog me this year . ... number nine ... ... and number forty three .
the rest of you ... ... better iuck next year .
coach , whats going on ?

youre pretty sick , chubbs .
ive never seen anyone ... ... who can hit the baii half as far as you .
you got reai talent .
thats nice of you to say , but i trained aii my iife to play hockey .
golf is no different requires talent , self discipline .
golf requires goofy pants and a fat ass .
talk to my neighbor a great golfer .
huge ass .
i bet your neighbor cant drive the baii 400 yards .
i bet your neighbor doesnt have a shot to get on the pro tour .
how would i do that ?
you win the open tomorrow , youre on the pro tour .
then , who knows ?
maybe youii win the tour championship .
get that gold jacket i never got .
gold jacket , green jacket who cares ?
dont worry .
its made of wood reai sturdy .
sorry about that .
it was good to meet you , but , uh ....

i thought you were pro material , primed for the big bucks .
hey , chubbs ... ... what kind of big bucks ?
stupid golf clubs .
why the heii am i doing this ?
whoa must be burt reynolds or something .
good morning !

blue skies , fresh cut grass , birds chirping .
you going to recite me a poem ?
geez , you love this golf stuff .
a guy your size why not play a reai sport , iike footbail ?
my mama wouldnt iet me .
said it was too dangerous .
yeah , good cail .
hey , whos that ?
the shorter guy is doug thompson , president of the tour .
the other guy is shooter mcgavin , ieading money winner this year .
whos the girl ?
im virginia venit , director of public relations for the tour .
of course .
ive heard youve done some reaily interesting things .

good morning , everyone .
welcome to the waterbury open .
before we begin , i have a treat for you .
ladies and gentlemen , shooter mcgavin .
thank you , doug .
i saw doug play yesterday .
he spends more time in the sand than david hasselhoff .
let me get serious .
youre aii aware ... ... todays winner wiii be invited to join the pro tour .
although only one wiii become my coileague ... ... aii of you are now my friends .
thank you .
now go get em !
lafferty , daniei and gilmore ... happy .
where you taking those clubs , punk ? !
mr. gilmore , im your caddy .
sorry .
iii carry these .
theyre my grandfathers .
theyre pretty old .
what should i do then ?
why dont you just watch me ... ... and make sure i dont do anything stupid ?
mr. gilmore , mr. lafferty is teeing off now .
okay .
good iuck , buddy .
get out of the way .
where were you that time , dipshit ?
probably the best iii hit aii day .
mr. gilmore , youre up .
damn it !
time !
relax .
do what we discussed .
dont iook at the green .
hit the bail .
theres no goalie anywhere to block it .
remember , its aii in the hip .
come on .
work with me .
its aii in the hips .
aii in the hips .
its aii in the hips .
get off me !
just easing the tension .
just easing the tension .
weil , ease it on someone else .
what the heil ?
good .
now we just worry about putting .
oh , yeah .
putting .
remember what i said .
use your shoulders to push the bail , not the arms .
dont break the wrist .
whoa , youre confusing me .
just iet me put the baii in the hole .
is he kidding ?
this is pathetic .
good shot .
its about time .
true .
i just couldnt get the baii in the hole .
i wanted to , but i couldnt .
he shoots , he scores !
that was much easier than putting .
i should try and do that every time .
good plan .
did you see that ?
yes .
nice .
he got a hole in one on a par four .
i said i saw it .
i hope he wins .
hes a publicists dream .
a guy who can drive the baii that far he could reaily draw a crowd .
so could a golfer with an arm growing out of his ass .
now , you make this one in four or iess shots ... ... you win the tournament .
four shots .
think of it this way .
the other team has puiled their goalie .
its wide open .
aii you have to do is tap it in .
i can do that .
dont worry .
youre doing fine .
aii you have to do is tap it in .
just tap it in .
just tap it in .
just tap it in .
just tap it in .

mr. gilmore , virginia venit .
im p. r. director of the tour .
nice to meet you .
congratulations .
i saw that hole in one on a par four .
that must be a record .
i got a hockey record .
i tried to stab someone with my skate .
nobody else ever did that .
thats wonderful .
i am a bit bummed .
i thought we got money for this .
and the guy who comes in iast ? usd2, 400 .
so no matter what , iii get some money .
yeah .
weil , iii see you next week then .
