the officer wants to know if you' re afraid .

the officer said there' s nothing to be afraid of .
co operate , and you' il be on the plane home .
where did you get the hashish ?
from a cab driver .
in the playing shop at the bazaar .
would you recognise him again ?
i think so .
you decided to fly at a bad time .
guerrillas all over the place , blowing up planes ...
four planes in four days .
don' t you read the newspapers ?
there' s been a shit storm over the flow of heroin from turkey .
i didn' t have heroin .
a drug is a drug .
it was my first time .
it was only two kilos .
it doesn' t matter if it was 2 or 200 kilos .
catching you shows the world turkey is fighting the drug trade .
are you with the consulate ?
something like that .
cigarette ?
what did you pay this cab driver ? $200 .
my last 200 .
how much did you figure to make ?
i' d only sell it to my friends .
i' m not a pusher .
honest .
it beats working .
have you got a family ?
mother , father , brother , sister .
long island .
it' il be tough on them .
girlfriend ?
yeah , she was on the plane .
she didn' t know anything about it .
lucky girl .
she used to say i was lucky .
let' s hope so , billy .
you seem like a nice enough kid .
but you try it , and i' il blow your brains out .
mom and dad , this is the hardest letter i' ve ever had to write .
i hoped to get out of this quickly , so you' d never know about it .
but that just isn' t possible now .
i don' t know what' s going to happen .
what can i say to you ?
will " i' m sorry " make a difference ?
will it ease the pain , the shame you must be feeling ?
forgive me , please .
could i have a blanket ?
it' s cold .
could i have a blanket ?
a blanket !
too late .
tomorrow .
he' il be here tomorrow , i think .
goodnight .
can you speak english ?
your cell is open .
blankets , three cells down .
you get me one .
i needed a blanket .
william hayes .
i needed a blanket , i was cold !
jesus ...
come on , you must stand .
you' d better walk around , or your feet will swell up .
you' ve got to be crazy .
we all are .
smoke some of this .
you' ve been out for days , talking all kinds of shit .
how does it feel ?
about as good as it looks .
gecmis olsun .
it' s turkish .
it means , " may it pass quickly .
it looks like a cheap hotel .
the room service is lousy .
i' m jimmy booth .
this is erich ... something swedish .
just erich .
he cleaned you up .
thanks .
i' m billy hayes ... at least i used to be .
why peacocks ?
they use them instead of dogs .
they scream like mad if they' re disturbed and they don' t get rabies .
who are the kids ?
little fuckers ...
thieves , rapists , murderers ...
you name it , they do it .
don' t trust any of them .
they tell rifki everything .
he' s the squeal around here .
he sells tea ,
hash , blankets , anything for a buck .
what are you in for , hash ?
yeah .
where ?
at the airport .
that' s heavy .
this ain' t the good old usa .
in turkey , it' s a fucking accident if you' re innocent .
nobody here is innocent .
don' t pay too much attention .
anything is possible in turkey .
they may not hit you for smuggling .
if they make it possession , you might even get bail .
if you make bail , you' re free .
sneak across the border to greece .
sure , keep dreaming .
see where it gets you .
like max .
it' s going to be a while before you taste a hamburger again .
you broke the law .
the law is sometimes wrong .
the law is never wrong !
the fucking law is .
people get on his nerves .
what' s he in for ?
stealing from a mosque .
what did he steal ?
two candlesticks .
that' s all ?
jimmy has more balls than brains .
he was in for a year and a half before he even told his parents .
what about you ?
hashish , like most foreigners .
what did they give you ?
12 years .
i had 100 grams .
you' ve got to get a good lawyer .
talk to the englishman .
max .
he' s been in the longest .
seven years .
gastro .
stomach medicine .
it' s got codeine in it .
it' s the best i can do around here .
max ...
lawyers ... ?
oh , yeah .
there' s no straight lawyers in turkey .
they' re all bent .
bent as hairpins .
occupational necessity .
they have special classes in corruption at night school .
if you' re suspected of honesty , you' re disbarred .
i knew a lawyer fellow once .
he got that frenchman off .
la roche .
a big smuggler .
200 kilos .
he put enough bread in enough pockets .
got bail .
vanished .
his name ?
who ?
the lawyer .
lawyer ?
who got the frenchman off .
yesil is his name .
i don' t know anything else about him .
yesil .
the best thing to do is get your ass out of here .
yeah , but how ?
catch the midnight express .
what' s that ?
it' s not a train .
it' s a prison word for ... escape .
it doesn' t stop around here .
dad , i' m sorry .
forget it .
i' il punch you in the nose later .
we' ve got to get you out of here .
this is a suit i brought for you .
smarten you up a little .
are you all right ?
yeah .
how' s mom ?
well , she' s bad .
she couldn' t make the trip .
you know mom .
her boy ...
susan told us before we got your letter .
she' s saving to come back here ...
don' t let her come .
how' s rob ?
how' s peg ?
they' re the same .
you know .
we told the neighbours you were in hospital in europe .
this is stanley daniels .
he' s the american consul here .
billy , we' re going to do everything in our power to get you out of here .
that' s necdit yesil , the lawyer you asked for .
i know exactly what you feel , but you must not worry .
we' il get the right court and the right judge .
i' il arrange everything , just right .
i understand that if you get bail , it' s easy to get across the border .
that' s what we' re shooting for .
i' ve spoken to the state department .
right now , relations with the turks aren' t too good .
nixon upset them .
our best bet is right here .
dad , i' il pay you back for this .
money doesn' t matter , billy .
not at this stage .
where did you get that limp ?
i twisted my ankle .
where are you staying ?
the hilton .
how do you like istanbul ?
interesting place .
the food is lousy .
the crap they sell in the restaurants ...
i had to run to the toilet .
you should have seen the toilet .
i' il eat at the hilton every night .
steak , french fries and ketchup .
billy ...
why did you do it ?
money .
i know you kids smoke that stuff and we drink booze ,
but taking it across the border , that' s stupid .
i know .
dad ... get me out of here .
i promise you .
just sit tight .
let me work with mr. daniels and mr. yesil here .
we' il get you out , okay ?
hey , billy ...
okay ?
okay .
what did that prosecutor say ?
it' s not important .
we made our case .
you spoke well .
the judge liked you .
mr. hayes , the judge is coming back .
four years , two months .
four years ?
we' il appeal .
it' il be reduced for good behaviour .
it is only for possession .
the prosecutor wanted a life sentence for smuggling .
to be honest , mr. hayes , it is a great victory .
with good time , it works out to about three years .
and then there' s the appeal .
daniels and yesil are all working for you .
we' re trying to get you transferred .
daniels thinks there might be a political amnesty any month now .
all right , billy ...
i know it sounds tough , but we are going to get you out .
i promise you .
don' t do anything stupid .
they could play with your sentence .
all right , now ...
i' m putting $500 in the bank .
anything you need , you write .
there' s food here , candy , writing paper ,
books , cigarettes , soap , toothbrush ...
i' ve sold insurance for 30 years .
now i' ve got to see my own son ...
jesus !
if i could be where you are ...
i' d be there .
i love you , dad .
you take good care of my boy , or i' il have your fucking head !
dear susan , 1970 has now passed into 1971 .
you can drift in here and never know you' re gone .
you can fade so far out , you don' t know where you are anymore .
i find loneliness is a physical pain that hurts all over .
to the turks everything is " soyle boyle " .
it means " iike this , like that .
you never know what will happen .
all foreigners are " ayip .
they' re considered dirty .
so is homosexuality , but they do it every chance they get .
there are about 1, 000 things that are " ayip " .
you can stab or shoot somebody below the waist but not above .
stabbing somebody in the ass is considered turkish revenge .
i know it must sound crazy to you , but this place is crazy .
one day , one of the new kids was raped .
so they picked out four of the worst kids .
then there' s rifki .
the more i know of him , the more i hate him . $10 for this shit ?
you pig .
there are no pigs in turkey .
this shit is shit .
no , it' s good .
good shit .
you big shit .
yeah , me big shit .
you asshole .
what is it with you ?
just what the hell is it , man ?
you don' t fuck with me , i don' t fuck with you .
you fuck with me all the time .
you make crummy tea .
you rip us off on the hash .
i make special tea for you .
we have to live like brothers .
we have to be in here together .
for all the money you' ve got , you' ve got nothing .
you are american , you don' t know .
know what ?
dog eat dog .
you fuck other man before he fucks you .
and you must fuck last .
come on down .
egbert ...
sodding cat .
william !
are you all right ?
the new american ambassador is following your case .
he says there is progress .
you want a cigarette ?
but there is another route ... ... that is quite possible .
for a proper amount of money , it is possible
to convince the ten officials to lose track of your papers
before the high court in ankara confirms your sentence .
and you could be in greece by the time they discover the mistake .
but i have to act before the official sentence is handed down .
and for that i must pay certain officials .
what' s that ?
the blueprints to the prison , man .
there was this german architect in the hospital .
he let me copy them .
it' s too bad you didn' t have a xerox machine .
there are two ways out of here .
one is over the roof , but that' s kind of risky .
the other way , i' il need your help , and that is under .
a tunnel ?
are you serious ?
this is not stalag 17 .
that' s where you' re wrong .
the tunnel is already built .
there' s a basement where they used to keep weapons .
beneath that are the catacombs the christians built to bury their dead .
we' re sitting right on top of it ... here .
the kraut says that there' s a bunch of hollow shafts .
they' re like dumbwaiters , all along these walls .
one of them is right next to our shower .
if we get in there , we can get down into the catacombs .
with three of us working , it shouldn' t take too long .
i swear i heard a couple of dead christians singing down there .
you stop shitting me , man .
okay ?
how do we get into the shaft ?
we knock three times and say we' re a friend of the deceased .
i' m getting this together and i don' t need no gastro head along .
you understand me ?
we go through the wall .
we go through the wall ?
go through the wall .
there' s no reinforced steel in those shower walls .
it' s real soft from underground seepage .
you can almost push it over .
all we have to do ...
we only have to use your screwdriver to scrape the mortar out .
we pull out three stones and squeeze through ...
squeeze through , and get our ass down the shaft .
it' s a two night operation .
what do we do in the catacombs ?
what do you want , a door ?
there' s miles of them down there .
you must be fucking crazy .
they' ve got to come up someplace .
you won' t find any catacombs , you' il just finish up in section 13 .
billy ... the tunnel or the roof ?
forget the wall .
rifki' s always there .
the roof is guarded .
help me get into the shaft .
if we get caught , i' il get the shaft .
i' il be back up to three years again , maybe more .
fuck it , then .
you choose your own death .
i' il do this thing on my own .
i' m taking the roof out of here .
no !
i can' t take it !
dear susan , jimmy was caught and beaten badly .
he got a severe hernia and lost a testicle .
he' s been in the sanatorium for months .
in comparison , my problems seem small .
but 2 years have gone by .
the turks are slowly draining my life away .
why do you keep your hair short ?
to remind me that i hate it here .
prison , monastery , cloister , cave .
prison ...
okay .
i' ve thought of another way .
another way what ?
out of here .
when i was in the sanatorium , there was only one guard on duty .
i could have got out of there .
why didn' t you ?
as soon as i could walk , they threw me back in here .
lucky you .
i tell you , billy ...
another ward in the sanatorium had no guard on it at all .
who was in it ?
three guys .
what was wrong with them ?
i don' t know .
i think they were dead .
it figures .
i' ve got to go .
it' s daniels !
turkish justice has done it again .
they' re going to let me off .
jimmy , i' m going home !
god !
i' ve got to go .
what' s wrong ?
sit down , billy .
i' m afraid i have some bad news for you .
is it dad ?
mom ?
no .
you' re going to have a new court .
what do you mean ?
the prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession .
he wanted a smuggling conviction .
the ankara court reviewed it .
it seems everyone wanted an example made .
a scapegoat .
we' ve been notified that they rejected the sentence .
there were 35 judges in the court .
28 voted for ... a life sentence .
the lower court in istanbul had to go along with the decision .
the judge likes you .
he notified your dad .
what do you mean , life ?
life for what ?
billy !
i have 53 days left !
so now it' s time for me to speak .
what is there for me to say ?
when i finish , you' il sentence me for my crime .
what is a crime ?
what is a punishment ?
it seems to vary from time to time and place to place .
what' s legal today is suddenly illegal tomorrow .
what' s illegal is suddenly legal because everybody' s doing it .
you can' t put everybody in jail .
i' m not saying this is right or wrong .
i' m just saying that' s the way it is .
i' ve spent 3 years of my life in your prison .
i think i' ve paid for my error .
if it' s your decision today to sentence me to more years ...
my lawyer ... that' s a good one .
he says , " be cool , billy .
be good .
i' il get you a pardon , an amnesty , an appeal .
this has been going on now for 3 years .
i' ve been playing it cool .
i' ve been good .
now i' m damn tired of being good .
you said i had 53 days left .
you hung 53 days in my face , and then you took them away .
and you !
i wish you could be standing where i' m standing right now .
then you would know something that you don' t know .
mercy !
you would know that a just society is based on the concept of mercy .
its sense of fair play and justice .
but i guess that' s like asking a bear to shit in a toilet .
for a nation of pigs , it sure is funny you don' t eat them .
jesus christ forgave the bastards , but i can' t .
i hate .
i hate you .
i hate your nation and i hate your people .
i fuck your sons and daughters because they' re pigs .
you' re a pig .
you' re all pigs .
my hands are tied by ankara .
i must sentence you , william hayes , to be imprisoned
for a term no less than 30 years .
may it pass quickly .
got the old istanbul blues
istanbul blues they give me 30 years ain' t got nothing left to lose ...
we are going to get you out .
i promise you .
don' t do anything stupid .
they could play with your sentence .
i was busted at the border ...
the best thing to do is get your ass out of here .
the best way you can .
hey , i think i found it .
come here .
listen to that .
do you hear anything ?
i told you , you suckers .
you didn' t believe me .
keep it down .
look how soft this is .
it' il be easy .
go and get rifki' s poker , but don' t wake him up .
it' s really soft .
it' s coming .
jimmy , it' s coming .
here , use this .
it' s coming real easy .
it' s coming right out .
it' s easier than i thought .
it' s a piece of cake .
it' s coming .
like butter .
hey , max .
rifki .
keep checking for rifki .
it' s okay .
watch it .
i thought you wanted out of here .
they' re loose .
let' s try .
watch your hernia .
fuck that .
okay ?
you got it ?
yeah .
that' s it .
it' s the shaft .
it' s coming .
it' s okay .
let' s go , billy .
it' s too late .
we' re not prepared .
we' il go tomorrow .
it' s too late .
let' s put them back .
help me .
any fuck ups and we should be back by dawn .
you got everything ?
maps , railroad , bus timetables .
okay , let' s do it .
can you see ?
no .
come on , max , get your ass down here .
this way to istanbul , baby .
watch it .
mind how you go there .
are you all right ?
come down this pole and cross over .
terrific .
all right , it' s a tunnel .
let' s go .
come on , max .
fuck !
what is that ?
shit !
shit !
it' s a dead end .
the turks must have blocked it up .
shit !
billy !
what the fuck are we going to do ?
what time is it ?
4 : 30 .
go back .
you must be fucking joking .
we go back , seal it up , and come back tomorrow .
every night , until we get out .
there' s got to be a way out .
billy , they found it .
rifki .
no do , no do .
i' m going to kick your brains all over your fucking kitchen .
fine !
good .
man to man .
when we' re finished , i' il bring hamidou and he' il kick your ass .
let' s go , max .
come on .
i know what i' m going to do .
what ?
i' m going to cut his throat .
whose ?
rifki .
what have i got to lose ?
anyway , i' d really enjoy it .
why don' t you sit down ?
you' re in no shape to kill anybody .
i want to cut his fucking throat .
it' s already been cut .
then i' il cut his balls off .
you know , if you really wanted to hurt rifki ...
his money .
steal that and you steal his life' s blood .
could you see his face if everything he had got snatched ?
if we only knew where he hid it .
i know where it is .
max ...
the money ?
them that hides can find , says l .
i' ve seen him , the big tit .
he looks at it , late at night .
talking to it .
where ?
max , where ?
the money , where ?
in his radio .
in the back of his radio .
that' s why he never plays it .
he never had one .
soon he' s back on the street .
no friends , no money , plenty of enemies .
i' il drink to that .
me , too .
i' ve just got some news on jimmy .
really ?
what ?
they sent him to hospital .
they ruptured his hernia again .
shit !
i guess he didn' t talk .
look at rifki , wearing a suit .
maybe he' s got a new job .
jesus !
not again .
hashish .
you' re kidding !
me ?
i didn' t sell him anything .
rifki' s lying .
he' s a liar !
rifki !
cigare , cigare , s' il vous plait .
please , listen to me .
excuse me , i' ve been wanting to speak to you .
you' re an american ?
yes , america .
my name is ahmet .
i studied philosophy at harvard , and also at oxford .
i also studied in vienna , and now i study here .
they put me here .
they say i raped a little child .
they' il never let me go .
they won' t let you go , either .
they tell you they' il let you go , but in fact you stay .
you see , we all of us come from a factory .
sometimes the factory makes bad machines that don' t work .
the bad machines don' t know they' re bad machines .
but the factory knows you are one of the machines that doesn' t work .
i think we' ve spoken enough for today .
i wish you goodnight .
my god !
billy !
what have they done to you ?
your family is fine .
senator buckley has made a special plea on your behalf .
they' ve called you a pawn in the game between nixon and the turks .
the letters are coming in .
people do care .
what ?
take it off .
you' il just make yourself ...
take it off .
s' il vous plait .
billy ...
i wish i could make it better for you .
please , don' t .
don' t .
susan .
yes , billy .
i love you .
i love you .
your father gave me this for you .
there' s pictures of your mom and dad , and rob and peg .
and in the back there' s a picture of your old friend mr. franklin .
remember him ?
from the bank .
he' s over in greece now .
he bought a ticket .
i' il give it to them for you .
don' t count on them .
don' t count on anyone but yourself .
you' re running out of time .
if you stay here , you' il die .
you' ve got to get yourself together .
you' ve got to get out of here .
good morning , my american friend .
there will be trouble if you go this way .
a good turk always walks to the right .
left is communist .
right is good .
you must go the other way .
the other way is good .
where are you going ?
why don' t you walk the wheel ?
what is the matter , my american friend ?
a bad machine doesn' t know he' s a bad machine .
you still don' t believe you' re a bad machine ?
to know yourself is to know god .
the factory knows , that' s why they put you here .
in time you' il know .
i already know .
you are a bad machine , that' s why the factory keeps you here .
do you know how i know ?
i know because i' m from the factory .
i make the machines .
max .
max !
i' m going away .
i' ve come to say goodbye .
you see , if i stay here , i' m going to die .
you' il die .
don' t die , max .
please , don' t die .
i' m going to come back for you .
you hang on for me .
you' re not taking me to the sanatorium !
