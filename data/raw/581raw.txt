you don' t .
hi .
can i help you ?
i don' t know .
can you ?
hi , dad .
hey , sweetie .
i thought you were bringing her home before lunch .
it' s my fault .
i lost track of time .
for someone who gets paid by the hour , you' d think you' d be more attuned to that .
come here , you .
i will talk to you later .
you have fun at the party tomorrow .
wish elizabeth happy birthday for me .
i will .
love you .
love you more .
wait a sec .
go on inside .
yeah , the nails ?
that was me , too .
what' s next , a g string ?
do you want to know the smartest thing i ever did ?
not marry you .
i forgot .
i don' t need it .
the fortune magazine said house painters are in the top two percentile of earnings .
were you always such a bitch or is this new ?
it' s child support .
just take it .
i' d just as soon not go to macy' s , buy her a coat ... pay for it with the money you made giving some asshole a blowjob .
do you not understand that what i do i do for her ?
please .
i want our kid to have every god damn thing i didn' t have .
i want her to have a new coat every year ... and piano lessons , and i don' t know , a fucking horse if she wants one .
here , baby girl , you go wherever you want .
you know what ?
let her go to community college ... and have a mother who' s a mother , not a prostitute .
you are such a clueless bastard .
nice car .
is it new ?
who' d you say you' re in this for ?
cookies and milk .
all day sucker . " what' s that ?
guess .
so , what do you feel like ?
maybe you could blow me ?
and i could ... fuck you after .
okay .
is $150 ...
is that about right ?
is that all you think i' m worth ?
so that' s velvet ...
knight , with a " k .
you know , i had a cat named velvet once .
lady , whose pussy we talking about , mine or yours ?
do me a favor .
save that kind of language for the clients .
you don' t like it so much , what' re you doing being a madam anyways ?
manager .
whatever .
the truth ?
it was the best paying job i could find .
yeah .
same here .
$400 .
half and half . $400 for a blowjob and a straight lay ?
yeah .
that' s a lot .
not for me .
here you go .
thanks .
so you know what a " half and half " is ?
i guess you' ve worked before .
not in nevada .
in la .
last couple of years .
time for a change of scenery , you know ?
here' s this all .
you people are strict here .
licenses , checkups every week .
man !
let me tell you how it goes here .
the girls are on for three weeks , working 10 to 12 hour shifts every day .
then they' re off for a week .
sometimes , we have girls who just work weekends ... and the house gets half of everything you make .
sounds all right .
i' m sorry .
is it possible that we' ve met before ?
because you look awfully familiar .
yo brooklyn , that tv show bunch of years back ?
vonetta knight , of course .
you play the sister .
yep .
my son and i watch the reruns on nickelodeon .
let me ask you something .
that rashad ?
played my little brother on the show .
how old you think he was when i was on it ?
how old ?
thirteen ?
fourteen ?
nineteen .
nineteen years old , almost twenty .
but his asshole daddylmanager wants everybody to think he' s some kid .
so one day , me and rashad are getting on in the dressing room ... daddy walks in , old man just about has a stroke .
next week , the script comes out and my character' s dead in a car wreck .
i got them the highest rating ever , those motherfuckers !
excuse me .
so why did you stop ?
you were good .
' cause daddy goes round town ... telling everybody i' m some piece of garbage .
job ends and suddenly i can' t get arrested ... except on hollywood boulevard , but that' s another story .
anyhow , those charges didn' t stick .
i' m sorry that happened to you .
yeah , well .
look , here' s what .
end of every show ... we' d all come out and the audience would give us a standing ovation .
it didn' t matter , every single week , standing " o.
and when i' m with a john and i do my sex thing , i watch him .
i watch him get hard .
his dick is standing straight up because of me .
so .
you got room for me ?
you want this ?
you don' t ?
i' m lucky to be getting away with flight attendant .
i don' t think he' il buy lion tamer on top of that .
you going to tell him ever ?
why would i ?
it' s who you are .
it' s who i was .
you must have some on off switch somewhere that i never saw .
where' s it , on your ass ?
no , wait , i' ve seen your ass .
yeah , and so has half the population of nevada .
and i don' t think my fianc needs to know that .
but aren' t you gonna wonder how he would feel if he knew ?
yeah , i' m going to wonder .
you know what else i' m going to do ?
i' m gonna keep my big mouth shut .
the past is the past , tay ... and this is my future .
okay ... but if i fall in love again someday , god forbid ... and the guy gives me attitude ' cause this is how i make my living ... fuck that .
that' s a deal breaker .
i better get in on this lineup .
you are going to make a beautiful bride .
come back and visit us once in a while , will you ?
probably not .
you know where the plates are ?
that one on the right .
thanks .
so mary let you stay ?
yeah .
i' m velvet .
good for you .
so what do you think of this place ?
everybody else seems nice .
bunch of jerks .
what ?
i' m not here to make friends .
i' m here to make money .
figure another year or two , i got enough cash , i' m out of here .
what are you gonna do ?
get out of this rat' s ass of a city .
get a house somewhere .
a house house , not a whorehouse .
get a foster kid , maybe .
two more years .
three , at the most .
you do pretty good then ?
i do fucking great .
stupid bitch , emily , with the tattoos , thinks her little pussy' s made of gold .
i book twice as much as she does .
oh , and by the way , cupcake ... you want to keep yourself away from my regulars , you got it ?
don' t you worry .
anything that goes into you , i don' t want going into me .
then we' il get along just fine .
you' re here !
i know .
finally .
i can' t believe it .
i know .
i missed you so much .
so you still want to marry me , or have you gotten over that silly idea ?
you bet .
let' s go get my bags .
wait .
isn' t there anybody you need to say goodbye to ?
any of the crew ?
the other stewardesses ?
no , all i want to do is get to the hotel and ...
that could work .
kim , get this .
in ancient greece , the only women allowed to own property were prostitutes .
probably the only ones who could afford to .
yeah , maybe .
what you got there ?
that' s what you read for fun ?
you' il get used to it .
just don' t play any trivia games with her .
or make bets .
i got to ask you .
who do i talk to about clean sheets ?
franny takes care of all the laundry .
but don' t let the guys under the sheets or you' il be changing them all day .
use one of those towels in your closet , trick towels .
that was your first john just now , wasn' t it ?
how' d that go ?
guy tells me he wants to do it like a dog .
i figure he means doggy style .
he breaks out a collar , a leash , i end up scratching him behind the ears ... and rubbing him on his belly till he goes off .
what the hell is that ?
you know , in la ... you get in the back of a dude' s car , suck him off , and that' s that .
i used to beat off my cousin' s dog .
hello ?
scrappy .
he was a show dog .
a jack russell terrier .
wouldn' t that make him a " jack off " russell terrier ?
one for the new girl .
my aunt and uncle wouldn' t let him fuck , ever .
except with another show dog , like , once a year .
he was always so frustrated .
he told you that ?
no , i could tell .
taylor , there' s a customer asking for you .
he said bicycle jimmy sent him .
thanks .
later .
man , another crappy day in the desert .
and i always thought california weather was amazing .
this is like heaven .
no shit .
wait .
you need sunscreen .
here , let me .
you' re not going to try and cop a feel , are you ?
how' s that ?
i' m sorry my mother made such a big deal about you staying at the house .
she' s old fashioned , is all .
she doesn' t believe in sex before marriage .
i don' t even think she believes in sex during marriage .
want me to tell her what she' s missing ?
wait a sec .
we have time .
my sister' s flight doesn' t get in for another hour .
probably be late , anyway .
what' s wrong ?
there' s ... something we have to talk about .
oh , god .
what ?
it' s not bad .
i mean , it' s bad , but it' s not ...
nobody' s dead or anything .
i got laid off .
when ?
about two weeks ago .
the whole midsize line , they' re not making them anymore .
sedans and station wagons .
just like that .
assholes .
oh , honey .
every time we talked on the phone , i wanted to tell you .
i hated lying when you' d ask me how work was .
but i thought it' d be better in person .
are you pissed ?
no .
it' s not your fault .
anyway , i was thinking , till i find something ... maybe you can transfer out here .
i don' t think i could transfer that easy .
because things like that take a lot of time to come through .
shit .
could you get your old route back ?
while i' m looking ?
i don' t know .
i' m sorry to dump this on you .
no , it' s fine .
i' m gonna go take a shower .
you' re not feeling like this changes everything , are you , hon ?
no .
my friend jimmy says that ... you give the best head of anybody he' s ever met .
tell him i said thanks for the referral .
yeah .
i don' t suppose i could get you to swallow , could i ?
i' d make it worth your while .
sorry .
you' ve got to keep the condom on the whole time .
i know .
but , damn !
i mean ... all day long , i' m in there and i' m marrying people and ...
that' s good .
anyway , all day long i' m pronouncing them " man and wife , baby , man and wife .
and i just keep trying to guess ... is this one gonna let him come in her mouth ?
or that one ?
here .
i' il be right in .
okay .
my girlfriend hardly ever gives me head .
she never lets me get off in her mouth .
says it tastes funny .
what you can try for that is pineapple juice .
i read that it makes your jizz taste better .
yeah , but won' t that sting ?
honey , you drink it , you don' t soak your dick in it .
so , the owner of this place ?
he' s some kind of slick , rich , white pimp wannabe ?
what' d i say ?
the owner is my uncle .
shit .
sorry .
don' t worry about it .
but for the record , no , he isn' t one of those .
his uncle is named david .
that' s why he' s the other david .
the boss is okay .
you got to keep booking or you' re out , that' s for sure .
but they take pretty good care of us .
other david takes especially good care of us .
hint , hint .
seven in the side pocket , baby .
it' s sure shot .
there' s no way those guys are partying .
but you know , when they' re humping their pillows tonight ... they' il be picturing you and me .
am i right , austin ?
guess so .
hey , austin , this is velvet .
she' s new .
maybe you' il try her out soon .
how' s it hanging ?
good .
it' s good .
he comes in every day , nurses one beer for hours ... then once every two weeks , on payday , he parties .
you can tell it' s payday when his hair' s clean .
good to know .
excuse me .
mary , are you kidding me ?
i' m in the middle of something here .
your daughter' s on the phone .
she' s crying .
says it' s urgent .
something about her dad won' t let her go to a party .
shit .
give me 30 seconds .
okay .
where do you go to school ?
colorado state .
same as my sister did .
she' s the brains in our family .
your mother won' t let me help her do anything .
you know , i was thinking about you the other afternoon .
i was watching one of those health channels on the cable ... and they did a whole show about jet lag .
you ever have any trouble with that , all that flying around ?
it bothered me at first , yeah .
but you get used to it .
you must meet so many interesting people with job like that .
i did , yeah .
athletes .
actors .
a couple of politicians .
look what we got .
here , let me get that .
there' s tuna salad , egg salad , and some turkey .
guy i work with , his daughter is a stewardess .
manny' s kid .
i remember her .
tall , long black hair .
tramp .
nice , ma .
i' m only saying what' s true .
the girl slept her way across the country .
maybe it was the jet lag .
we need more lemonade .
where' s your brother ?
he' s upstairs , i think .
tommy .
we' re eating .
come on down .
sorry .
i was just getting things set for later .
shayna , you don' t mind , do you ?
me and the guys kidnapping evan for the night ?
no , who am i to get in the way of a good bachelor party ?
just so you know , we' re skipping the whole strip club thing .
i should hope so .
kidding me ?
you could get a disease just looking at some of those skanks .
sorry , ma .
not that either of us would know about this firsthand .
thank goodness for small favors .
eat .
thanks , ma .
i' il see you both tomorrow .
see you tomorrow .
and get some sleep tonight .
that was a boatload of fun .
what ?
oh , good .
i thought you' d gone into a coma there .
it' s the day before her wedding .
she' s just a little tense .
you are .
thank you .
why are you marrying me ?
what ?
why do you love me ?
let me see .
because you' re hot ?
i' m kidding .
i mean , you are , but that' s not ...
i have this uncle .
uncle lou , he' s quite a character .
you' il meet him tomorrow .
whenever he talks about a woman he really likes ... he calls her a good girl .
that audrey hepburn , she' s a good girl .
anyway , after that first weekend you and i spent together ...
i finally understand what you' re talking about uncle lou .
i met a good girl .
i' m so glad chelsea made it .
elizabeth would have been crushed if she wasn' t here .
i' m sorry we' re so late .
there was a mix up with chelsea' s dad .
so nice to meet you finally .
yeah , you , too .
what time do you want me to pick her up ?
no , stay .
please .
i can' t .
at least have a cup of coffee .
okay .
come on .
everybody , this is chelsea' s mom .
sorry , i don' t know your first name .
taylor .
we were beginning to think you didn' t really exist .
this is me .
i' m gail , melody' s mom .
hi .
that' s inez and patty .
inez is brittany' s mom , and patty' s got the twins .
how' s it going ?
good .
found it .
hon , this is taylor .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
i should get this out to the karaoke machine .
excuse me .
thanks .
can i ask you a question , taylor ?
yeah .
i mean , it' s none of my business and it' s probably not even true ... but did i hear correctly that you work at the diamond ranch ?
for god' s sake .
no , it' s okay .
that is where i work .
as a ...
as a what ?
a prostitute ?
what do you do , inez ?
i teach yoga .
you charge by the hour ?
yeah .
the more clients , the more money you make ?
that' s very cute .
i wasn' t trying to be .
it' s the same concept .
probably some of the same positions , now that i think about it .
would you excuse me , please ?
apple doesn' t fall far from the tree , apparently .
i' il say it again
i' ve got a 20 dollar goldpiece
that says there' s nothing i can' t do !
i can make a dress out of a feedbag and i can make a man out of you
' cause i' m a woman
w o m a n
it' s nothing .
they' re kids .
she probably doesn' t even know what she' s even singing about .
yeah .
feed the baby , grease the car and powder my face at the same time
listen ... thanks for not busting me back there .
i would never do that .
rory would die if she knew .
yep .
i can still come and see you , though , can' t i ?
i' il be back to pick up chelsea in about an hour .
woman
a w o m a n
i' il say it again
dude , come on .
i' m tying my shoe , give me a break .
what the fuck for ?
it' s gonna be off in , like , a minute .
go for it .
it' il put some hair on your chest .
what' s to think about ?
take the gorgeous one .
give me a minute .
it' s a birthday present from me to him .
and you know what a good brother i am ?
i' m not even banging one of them myself .
i only saved up enough money for him to .
very nice of you .
i' il take her .
jean jacket .
it' s your dick .
all right , then , emily .
thank you , girls .
i' il be waiting at the bar , bro .
knock yourself out .
mary , your son' s here .
really ?
hi , sweetie .
what are you doing here ?
is everything all right ?
i don' t know where my house key is .
i think i lost it at the park .
i' il go get mine .
be right back .
so ... what are you thinking you might like ?
i don' t want to do this .
are you not very experienced , scotty , is that it ?
it' s all right .
i' il teach you .
learn on me .
baby , are you a virgin ?
no .
are you gay ?
fuck you !
hey , any time you' re ready .
i didn' t hear a yes or a no .
yes .
you having a little chat with yourself ?
yes , okay ?
yes , i' m a fag .
there , i said it , you happy now ?
so what' s the deal , your brother doesn' t know ?
it' s none of his business .
that' s fair .
no , wait , i' il pay you for this , okay ?
just let me stay in here till it' s been long enough time .
what the hell .
it' s not the worst lie i' ve ever been part of .
not by a long shot .
you do use condoms , right ?
when you' re with a guy ?
yes .
every time ?
yes .
just making sure .
okay , one of these .
and a t shirt , the black one .
and a couple of these .
that' s $27 even .
can i get a beer ?
yeah , sure .
thought i' d get the kid a couple of souvenirs .
not that he' s ever gonna forget this , right ?
that' il be $4 .
thanks , bud .
scotty' s probably banging that chick pretty good by now .
probably .
diamond ranch .
yeah , hold just a sec .
austin , it' s for you .
hello .
what ?
jesus , what' s with the sirens ?
you want me to get you a beer ?
you want me to put some music on ?
i' m okay .
you play guitar ?
i always meant to learn how .
i had a boyfriend in a band .
i used to go on tour .
sing backup sometimes .
cool .
i had this fantasy that somebody would discover me .
who' s that babe in the back ?
i guess when you' re drunk out of your mind ... most of the time you' re not such a hot investment .
i guess not .
i' m named for a song .
not really , but what i use for work .
how come ?
because some of us don' t use our real names .
anyhow , i picked emily .
it' s from this record my sister would listen to when i was a kid .
i don' t know that song .
emily
you' re the natural snow
the unstudied sea
you' re a cameo
keep going .
no .
that was pretty .
thanks .
my uncle , my mom' s brother ... he produces shows at the hilton in reno .
they' re always looking for singers .
i could give him your tape .
do you have one ?
someplace .
listen , you don' t have to do me any favors or anything .
i' m not going to rat you out to your brother .
that' s not why i said it .
okay .
peter , wait .
god damn it , taylor , i knew it .
she' s in there ?
yes , she is .
let go .
wait , don' t go and embarrass her in front of her friends .
she' s not even supposed to be at that party .
i told her .
she talked back to you one time , big fucking deal .
don' t you tell me how to raise my daughter .
whoa .
our daughter .
my daughter , three out of every four weeks .
or has that fact conveniently escaped your mind ?
no .
look , i appreciate how you take care of her .
you appreciate it ?
what am i , the baby sitter ?
did i say that ?
i was trying to teach her something .
and you just swooped right in .
regular goddamn mary poppins .
hey , pal , i' m not the baby sitter , either .
and what was so important that you couldn' t let her go to a stupid party ?
you want to know ?
yeah , i want to know .
every day she gets more and more like you .
and that scares the shit out of me .
so you can go .
i' il wait for her out here .
i won' t embarrass her .
i won' t punish her .
go .
there you are .
you hiding back here ?
yeah , kind of .
what' s up ?
i' m supposed to let you know that mister tits is here ... and he can' t wait to see you .
his words , not mine .
lucky me .
but he does pay me a fortune .
and all i have to do is let him snort a little coke off my boobs .
hey , i don' t need the details .
sorry .
sometimes i forget you' re not one of the girls .
thanks .
you know what i mean .
hey , did you hear about austin ?
no , what ?
his house burned down , electrical fire .
he lost everything .
shit .
and at that moment my love juices exploded into her ...
and i let out a loud moan of complete and utter ecstasy .
and i have to say i' m pretty sure ...
she enjoyed it as much as i did .
every one of them writes that .
god bless them , if they only knew .
yetta , can i get a bowl of soup with some poison please ?
rough day ?
kind of , yeah .
what' re you up to ?
reading my reviews .
the brothel website ?
can i ask you a favor ?
this is just , you know , for play .
can you help me type a rsum .
come on , first shayna , now you .
no .
i' m not going anywhere .
it' s just to see , hypothetically ... what else i might be qualified for .
if you leave , i' il hunt you down and kill you .
i' il keep that in mind .
okay , i' ve never done one of these .
i guess you put down your education first .
did you go to college at all ?
fuck me , i never even finished high school .
let' s skip that part then .
what do you think would be your best qualifications ?
professionally speaking .
i give excellent head .
skilled at oral presentations .
i like that .
exceptional manual dexterity .
keen negotiator .
works well in group situations .
leaving out the words " orgy room .
flexible .
stimulating .
you' re good .
would 69 be considered multitasking ?
i don' t see why not .
what' s up ?
nothing much .
anybody in the mood for a threesome ?
i got a live one with deep pockets .
you take it .
would you mind leaving this here ?
no , turn it off when you' re done .
another ebony and ivory fantasy .
i' m down with that .
fucking joke .
get you another rum and coke ?
thanks .
so what kind of ladies you got working here ?
i' m thinking i might like to party .
do you want me to call a lineup ?
no .
i' d feel bad for the ones i didn' t pick .
they' re used to it .
it' s part of the job .
so what' s your type ?
female and breathing .
you might want to be a little more specific .
well , between you and me , i really like the colored girls .
the blacker the better .
and tall .
give me a set of long dark legs ... and i' m a happy man .
you' re in luck .
we' ve got a girl just like that , started this week .
velvet .
i like her already .
is she on tonight ?
yeah , she should be out any minute .
let me ask you , though , what' s it gonna cost me to party with this velvet ?
i don' t know .
that' s between you and her .
hey , velvet , want to come here a minute ?
hey , what' s going on ?
i' ve got a guy who' d like to meet you .
hi .
carlos .
you thought you' d get away from me ?
what the fuck do you think you' re doing ?
why , you didn' t think i was going to find out ?
you didn' t think my other bitches were going to give you up ?
i' m sorry .
i will fucking kill you .
you don' t even think about it .
come on , bitch .
leave her alone .
lady , what , are you serious ?
i mean it , let go of her .
fucking crazy !
leave her alone and get out of here .
now !
are you okay ?
damn it , i should have known this guy was up to something .
how could you have ?
this is still bleeding .
it' s deep , but i don' t think you' il need stitches .
good .
let me in there one more time .
i' ve got some percocets in my room if you need them .
i think aspirin will be fine , thank you .
okay , there .
what was that ?
must have been the loss of blood .
no , seriously .
seriously , i have wanted to do that since ... well , how long have you worked here ?
three years .
then 2 years , 11 months , and 29 days .
what was wrong with me the first day ?
here you go .
cold .
ice does that .
does it hurt ?
yeah .
fuck .
he was your pimp ?
a bastard from the first day i met him .
keep that on here .
thanks for keeping me company .
i know i' m probably not the most popular person now .
well , it' s funny .
i feel like i know you .
i guess because i used to watch you on your show .
not because we both just fucked the same guy together ?
no , i think it was the show .
i always though it was funnier if i had a little bit of a buzz on .
yeah , me , too .
you ever have a pimp ?
no , i didn' t need one .
this is a family business for me .
so , you' re related to that david guy ?
no .
my grandmother worked at the mustang ranch back when it first opened .
my mom still puts in a couple days a month over at the bunnyranch .
so me doing this was pretty much a given .
even with you being a dyke ?
he paid me to kiss you .
i don' t mean that shit before , i mean you with that emily .
i see you looking at her all moony eyed .
can we drop this ?
i don' t get it .
you can talk about giving a dog a hand job , no problem ... but you can' t say , maybe you like a girl .
she doesn' t know .
please don' t tell anyone .
i won' t .
don' t get too drunk , okay ?
don' t worry .
anyway , tommy' s driving .
speaking of which , i told the limo driver to pick you two up at the hotel at noon .
have fun .
good night .
he is such a nice guy .
yeah , i guess opposites do attract .
so what do you want to do ?
go back to the room and watch pay per view ?
get a massage ?
beth ann ?
i need to talk to you for a minute .
this probably isn' t fair to do to you , but i just ...
i need to say this out loud to somebody .
what is it ?
remember lindsay ?
she was my roommate in college , junior year ?
crazy lindsay , yeah , what about her ?
she worked in a brothel every weekend in nevada .
a whorehouse ?
yeah .
what does this have to do with you ?
one time , super bowl weekend , she knows it' s going to be busy after the game ... and she says i can go with her .
no .
you didn' t .
well , this was after teddy had broken up with me .
and you know what a hard time i was having with that .
i just needed somebody ... to make me feel like i was worth being with .
i made $2, 000 in , like , a day and a half .
and i was practically failing my classes anyway ... because you' re the smart one .
i never finished college .
and i was never a flight attendant .
come on .
beth ann , i know has to be ...
this isn' t funny .
it' s true .
stop it !
please .
i didn' t plan this .
this is just how it worked out .
you' re a prostitute ?
i was , but i was going to quit .
how many guys ?
i don' t know .
like hundreds ?
probably .
i feel nauseous .
please , don' t throw up .
i can handle almost anything but that .
no , i need to get out of here .
sweetie , are you okay ?
don' t !
i don' t know where to put this in my brain .
every day , mommy used to call the airline to see when your plane got in .
even when she was sick , even when she was dying , she made me promise ...
to check if your flights landed okay .
i' m sorry .
i wanted to tell you so many times .
why didn' t you ?
evan doesn' t know , does he ?
no .
you have to tell him .
i can' t .
he' s marrying you .
it' s like you said , he is a nice guy .
why do this to him ?
and , my god , you saw his family .
his mother thinks if you' re a stewardess you' re a whore .
she would die if he told her .
i have a chance to be happy .
this isn' t only about you .
beth ann , i need you , don' t ...
you' re disgusting .
i hope nobody sees us .
i remember when i started here , they said that they discourage ...
fuck , what do they call it ?
intra house fraternizing .
yeah , i guess " don' t shit where you eat " didn' t sound classy enough .
well , i wouldn' t worry about it .
i kind of got an in with the management .
you' re so pretty .
how many of those have you had there ?
i mean it , you are .
you know what you taste like ?
what ?
miller lite .
hey , did you know that if a guy drinks a beer ... and then eats a girl' s pussy , he can give her a yeast infection ?
taylor told me that .
em .
what ?
don' t .
don' t what ?
it' s not a work night .
in other words , don' t be such a whore .
i didn' t say that .
i know .
i know you didn' t .
i don' t know why i thought we could do this .
come on , no , i didn' t mean anything .
what , we' re going to date ... and then you' re going to watch me take other guys to my room all night ?
i' m going to say , " i need a long island iced tea for my john back there " ... and that' s going to be okay ?
i don' t know .
yeah .
i' il make it be okay .
how the hell are you going to do that ?
i couldn' t do that .
i don' t know .
but i will .
emily , i' m crazy about you .
i want to make this work .
you know what ?
you are one of the sweetest , kindest men i' ve ever met .
and , baby ... you deserve a whole lot better than for your girlfriend to be me .
busted .
can i talk to you ?
yeah , come on in .
did i wake you up ?
no , i couldn' t fall asleep .
i' m really sorry .
i didn' t think he' d find me .
at least , not so quick .
i' il pay for that lamp , the one you shot .
i bet that' s the first time you ever heard that .
how' s your lip ?
better .
lucky we working girls got that rule about no kissing the customers because ...
did he hurt you ?
before , when you were together ?
all the time .
you sharing ?
yeah , i' il get you a glass .
please don' t fire me .
i know that' s what you must be thinking right now .
please .
i don' t know , velvet .
it might not be safe for you to stay .
safer than me being out on the streets with him looking for me .
i mean , for everybody else .
look , you can spend the night on the couch .
mom .
honey .
i heard talking .
everything' s okay .
ray , this is velvet .
hey , ray .
do me a favor .
get pillows and a blanket from the closet .
why ?
she' s sleeping here ?
tonight .
what , is this a whorehouse now , too ?
just do what i asked you to do .
go on .
it' il be more comfortable with the pillows off .
em , you going to the doctor ?
i' m sorry , what ?
the doctor .
the vans are leaving in a little bit .
all right .
shayna' s getting married today .
couple of hours .
i know .
i was just thinking about her .
did you and other david have an okay time last night ?
it' s not going to be anything .
i thought it would be , but ... actually it was a fucking disaster !
how the fuck do you have a relationship ?
how do you do this job and have a boyfriend or a husband ?
do you have to make up some bullshit story like shayna did , is that the only way ?
no , i don' t think so .
maybe you' il find somebody who gets it .
who understands this , you know ... and who loves you for who you are .
the whole package .
yeah , where the hell am i going to find that ?
beth ann ?
i help to you ?
yeah , thanks .
could i ask you a question ?
because i need an objective opinion .
i' m getting married today , apparently .
there' s something he doesn' t know about me .
and it' s something big .
and some people might think i don' t deserve to marry him .
but i' m not a horrible person , i' m not .
and , you know , people keep secrets all the time , right ?
what do you think i should do ?
that' s fine .
thanks .
good , boris is here .
i could use more leather armbands .
let me get some cash , i' il meet you .
okay .
tay , you coming ?
not right now .
okay .
i felt funny waiting inside .
they said you' d be back soon .
do you have a few minutes ?
yeah .
kim , you got a second ?
velvet' s looking for you .
she wants to say goodbye .
what' s she saying goodbye for ?
why do you think ?
where' s mary ?
kitchen .
what are the odds he' il come back here ?
probably very high .
okay , so we call the sheriff .
she' s a tv star , it' il be good for business .
kim , she got fired after one season on a sitcom .
you know , it' s not exactly like halle berry showed up and asked for a job .
halle berry showed up and asked for a job ?
yeah , she did , and i told her she could have your room .
i thought you were coming right out .
mary' s firing velvet .
come on , mom , can' t she stay and play with us ?
can' t she , please ?
i' m supposed to keep this place safe for you .
besides , how would i explain this to david ?
don' t tell him about it , that' s how .
you don' t think other david called him as soon as he got out of here last night ?
i can pretty much guarantee you that didn' t happen .
i' il see you out there .
think about this .
velvet had this life that was happy ... she was doing her show , everything was working out for her ... and then all of a sudden , that' s over with and she' s alone .
do you have any idea how horrible that must feel ?
you mean like when my husband died ... and he left me and ray all alone with no money and no life insurance ?
yeah , i' m familiar with that feeling .
i' m sorry .
mary , i didn' t know that .
any more trouble , she' s out of here .
thank you .
so this is your room then ?
yeah .
it' s cozy .
it' s the accessories that really make the difference , don' t you think ?
please don' t make fun of me .
i' m not .
this is difficult for me to ask you .
but i came here to ask , so ...
could you help me be better at sex ?
i' m sorry ?
i don' t think i' m making my husband happy anymore .
i' m scared that he might look for someone else .
if he hasn' t already .
and i thought , maybe , you as a professional ...
of course , i' il pay you for your time .
oh , no , was that a terrible thing to ask you ?
you mean as opposed to , like , asking for my special recipe for meatloaf ?
i' m sorry , i had no business .
no , wait , hang on a second .
don' t go .
you didn' t insult me .
it' s flattering .
kind of .
you' re just catching me on a really bad day .
why ?
what' s wrong ?
okay , here' s the way that i figured it .
chelsea' s in school all day .
we talk every night , and the week i have with her every month ... it' s me and her , nobody else , that' s it .
i thought that i could do this job and still be a good mother .
you know ?
and i could still be a good influence on her .
what an idiot .
you must be doing something right .
chelsea' s crazy about you .
she talks about you all the time .
yeah ?
does she say that her mother' s a fucking whore ?
yes , i' m back .
i just wanna thank the academy for this great honor .
girl , i' m glad you' re staying .
we need more sisters around here .
thank you , baby .
i won' t forget what you did .
what do you think , boris ?
nice .
sexy .
very sexy .
does it push my tits up enough ?
i get you a smaller size .
thanks .
well ?
pretty .
did you ask her yet ?
no , but i will now .
good .
rickie lee .
we' re taking up a collection to help austin get back on his feet .
you heard about the fire , right ?
yeah .
each of us is going to do a trick for him today .
how about it , you in ?
sure , i' il just pull a rabbit out of my snatch .
god , forget i fucking asked .
smaller size .
thanks .
boris , did you get those saddle shoes i asked you for ?
you said you' d get them for me this week .
inside the truck , i' il check .
thank you .
selfish bitch .
you got something to say to me , emily , say it .
you won' t give any money for austin , but you' il spend it on that sick little girl act .
you think i give a shit ?
you think i give a shit what you think of me ?
i don' t think you give a shit about anything or anybody ... except those sleazeballs you' re so busy getting off .
listen , twat face ...
i' il fucking ...
emily , stop it !
let me tell you something .
if some asshole wants to fuck a little girl ...
i' d just as soon it be me and not his 10 year old daughter .
sure i can' t get you anything else ?
i' m good .
the usual .
you looking to party ?
i' m waiting for emily .
i' m better .
i' m gay .
i' ve got a cub scout uniform i could wear if that would do it for you .
no , thanks .
for somebody who doesn' t sleep with girls , you spend a lot of time at a whorehouse .
what ?
one of the singers in the show ... at the hilton , they' re doing this ' 60s revival thing ...
janis joplin girl got strep .
my uncle heard your tape , he wants you to audition .
get out of here .
it' s only temporary ...
is this for real ?
yeah .
get out of here .
oh , my god .
i love you .
what' s going on ?
i got an audition , singing , in reno .
that' s fantastic .
oh , my god , i could fuck you till the cows come home .
please don' t .
here we go .
to emily .
to emily .
i , shayna , take you , evan , to be my husband .
to have and to hold from this day forward .
for better , for worse , for richer , for poorer .
in sickness and in health , to love and to cherish , until death do us part .
before god and in the presence of this congregation ...
evan and shayna have made their solemn vows to each other .
therefore , i proclaim that they are now husband and wife .
evan , you may kiss your bride .
what are you doing ?
living vicariously .
here .
give it a shot .
you ready ?
you' re not going to hurt it .
attagirl .
you don' t like it much here , do you ?
i don' t know .
not yet .
getting there .
i love it here .
men fuck me , and then they pay me , it' s unbelievable .
you can make an ugly guy feel handsome .
you can make an old guy feel young .
the power of the pussy , right ?
and the money .
oh , man .
hookers make pretty much the same hourly rate that lawyers do .
i mean , beat that with a stick .
taylor , why are you telling me all this ?
because i have to leave .
peter ?
chels ?
no .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
that son of a bitch .
hello , diamond ranch .
no , i' m sorry .
she doesn' t work here anymore .
i know .
but if you come in , we have a number of very beautiful girls ... and i' m sure you' il find someone you can be satisfied with .
okay .
aren' t you going to congratulate the bride ?
oh , shayna .
