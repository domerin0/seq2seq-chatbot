lazarus .
lazarus .
adonai .
god , help me .
we came here to pray .
look at this .
the money changers ?
it' s for the temple tax , for the feast .
i know .
i know .
how' s the exchange today ?
fair .
at this stall it' s always fair .
making a good profit ?
fair .
this is my father' s house !
it is a place of worship ... ... not a market !
nazarene , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
god doesn' t need a palace .
he doesn' t need cypress trees or dead animals !
he doesn' t need shekels !
you expect people to pay the tax with roman coins .
they have images of false gods on them !
you want pagan gods in the temple ?
all foreign coins have to be exchanged for shekels .
that is the law .
i' m throwing away the law .
i have a new law and a new hope .
what ?
has god changed his mind about the old law ?
no .
he just thinks our hearts are ready to hold more , that' s all .
this chaos is your new law ?
how can you presume
how can i presume ?
i' m the end of the old law and the beginning of the new one .
watch what you' re saying .
maybe we should go .
when i say , " i , " rabbi ... ... i' m saying " god .
that' s blasphemy .
didn' t they tell you ?
i' m the saint of blasphemy .
don' t make any mistakes .
i didn' t come here to bring peace .
i came to bring a sword .
talking like that will get you killed .
me killed ?
listen to me .
this temple will be destroyed in three days .
torn down to the ground !
there won' t be one stone left to build with !
you think god belongs only to you ?
he doesn' t .
god' s an immortal spirit who belongs to everybody
to the whole world !
you think you' re special !
god is not ...
magician , heal me .
cure us .
make us rich .
heal me !
do a miracle .
you want me to enter the world of god crippled like this ?
don' t touch me !
you' re filled with hate !
get away !
god won' t help you .
you cure us , or you won' t leave this city alive .
you don' t make demands on god !
judas !
what are you doing with this magician ?
you had orders to kill him and you haven' t done it .
now he acts like a prophet and you follow him .
did you hear what he said back there , saul ?
yes , i heard him .
we took an oath against rome .
i don' t see anything against rome here .
all i see are jews against jews .
then you' re not listening .
lazarus .
how do you feel ?
i like the light .
what was it like ?
which is better , death or life ?
i was a little surprised .
there wasn' t that much difference .
give me your hand .
i' m not surprised .
how could they let lazarus live ?
he was proof of your greatest miracle .
now there' s no more proof .
that' s what the zealots want .
their revolution , not yours .
you want to go back to them ?
no .
you' re the one i follow .
you are the strongest , aren' t you ?
of all my friends ... ... you' re the strongest .
judas , my brother ... ... i' ve something to tell you .
i have a terrible secret from god .
you know why i came to jerusalem ?
yes .
this is where the revolution is going to begin .
last night isaiah came to me .
he had a prophecy .
i saw it written .
he has borne our faults ... ... he was wounded for our transgressions ... ... yet he opened not his mouth .
despised and rejected by all ... ... he went forward without resisting , like a lamb led to the slaughter .
i don' t understand .
judas , i am the lamb .
i' m the one who' s going to die .
die ?
you mean you' re not the messiah ?
i am .
that can' t be .
if you' re the messiah , why do you have to die ?
listen .
at first , i didn' t understand  no , you , listen !
every day you have a different plan !
first it' s love , then it' s the axe , and now you have to die .
what good could that do ?
i can' t help it .
god only talks to me a little at a time .
he tells me as much as i need to know .
we need you alive !
now i finally understand .
all my life i' ve been followed ... ... by voices ... ... by footsteps ... ... by shadows .
and do you know what the shadow is ?
the cross .
i have to die on the cross and i have to die willingly .
we have to go back to the temple .
after you die on the cross , what happens then ?
i come back to judge the living and the dead .
i don' t believe you .
you have to .
i' m worried he' s going to change his mind again .
no , he won' t .
this time we' re not going to the temple to pray .
he said he' il destroy the temple in three days , and he' il do it .
and what if he doesn' t ?
what then ?
what if he doesn' t ?
you won' t have to worry because we' il all be dead .
we' re setting up a new government , building a new jerusalem .
we can ask for anything we want .
first , i' d like more sheep .
you know , my other sheep , i don' t even know where they are now .
this time i want a large herd , and i' il get other shepherds to care for them .
i would just like to be able to worship in the temple .
i mean really worship , without roman banners and soldiers .
that' s what i' d like .
of course .
but what else ?
i' il do anything the master asks , anything but get crucified .
you' re a coward , thomas .
yes , i am .
you know why ?
have you ever seen anyone on a cross after two days ?
you know what they look like ?
they don' t even have eyes .
the crows come and suck out your eyes .
and after that , you know what ?
dogs come and rip your feet off .
don' t talk that way .
i' ve made my decision .
you make yours .
and if you can' t , then get out now before we get to jerusalem .
i' m ready .
i have my knife .
master , i' ve been talking with the others and listening and ....
will there be angels there to meet us ?
or anyone besides who' s here ?
master .
king of the jews !
king of the jews !
king of the jews !
jesus !
lord , i hope this is what you want .
let me die here .
please let it happen fast while i have the strength .
i am here to set fire to the world .
in the desert , the baptist warned us , god is coming .
well , i' m telling you it' s too late .
he' s already here .
i' m here .
i' m going to baptize everybody with fire !
he' s leading us !
follow him !
they' re all with you , waiting for your signal .
give it !
now !
do it now !
please !
i' m waiting , too .
give me an axe , not the cross .
let me die like this .
give the sign now or we' re finished .
they' il kill us  we came to fight , not to die !
master , we knew it would be like this .
this is the way .
do it .
judas , help me !
stay with me .
don' t leave me .
i wish there was another way .
i' m sorry , but there isn' t .
i have to die on the cross .
i won' t let you die .
you have no choice , neither do i.
remember , we' re bringing god and man together .
they' il never be together unless i die .
i' m the sacrifice .
without you , there can be no redemption .
forget everything else .
understand that .
no , i can' t .
get somebody stronger .
you promised me .
remember , you once told me ... ... that if i moved one step from revolution , you' d kill me .
remember ?
yes .
i' ve strayed , haven' t i ?
yes .
then you must keep your promise .
you have to kill me .
if that' s what god wants , let god do it .
i won' t .
he will do it through you .
the temple guards will be looking for me where there aren' t any crowds .
we' il go to gethsemane .
you' il make sure that they find me there .
i am going to die .
but after three days ... ... i' il come back , in victory .
you can' t leave me .
you have to give me strength .
if you were me , could you betray your master ?
no .
that' s why god gave me the easier job ... ... to be crucified .
what about the others ?
i' il tell them tonight .
listen to me .
take this bread .
share it together .
this bread is my body .
now drink this wine .
pass the cup .
this wine is my blood .
do this to remember me .
we' re not finished .
let him go .
all of you ... ... i want to tell you something .
wait for me here .
father in heaven .
father on earth .
the world ... ... that you' ve created , that we can see , is beautiful .
but the world you' ve created , that we can' t see , is beautiful , too .
i don' t know .
i' m sorry , father .
i don' t know which is more beautiful .
this is my body , too .
together ... ... we' re going to die .
please , father .
i' ve been with you for so long .
i never asked you to choose me .
i always did as you said .
you made many miracles for others .
you opened the red sea for moses .
you saved noah .
you took elijah to heaven in a fiery chariot ... ... and now you' re asking me to be crucified .
can i ask you ... ... one last time ?
do i have to die ?
is there any other way ?
you' re offering me a cup , but i don' t want to drink what' s in it .
please , take it away .
please , stop .
please , father .
father .
please .
is this your answer ?
all right .
just please give me the strength .
couldn' t you stay awake with me for just an hour ?
i' m sorry .
it doesn' t matter .
it' s too late .
welcome , rabbi .
no .
you live by this , you die by it .
take me with you .
i' m ready .
so , you are the king of the jews ?
king " is your word .
well , you are jesus of nazareth , aren' t you ?
yes , i am .
that' s what they' re saying you are .
the king , the messiah .
it' s also said that you do miracles .
is this good magic or bad magic ?
could we have some kind of a demonstration ?
i mean , can you do a trick for me , now ?
no , i' m not a trained animal .
i' m not a magician .
that' s disappointing .
this means that you' re just another jewish politician .
do you want to know something ?
you' re more dangerous than the zealots .
do you know that ?
say something .
you had better say something .
all right .
tell me what you tell people on the streets .
yes ?
yes .
a tall statue that had a gold head and silver shoulders .
the stomach was bronze , the legs were iron , the feet were clay .
a stone was thrown .
the clay feet broke and the statue collapsed .
you see , god threw the stone .
the stone is me .
and rome
and rome is the statue , yes .
so your kingdom , or your world , will replace rome .
where is it ?
my kingdom ?
it' s not here .
not on earth .
it wouldn' t be , would it ?
it' s one thing to want to change the way that people live ... ... but you want to change how they think , how they feel .
all i' m saying is that change will happen with love , not with killing .
either way , it' s dangerous .
it' s against rome .
it' s against the way the world is .
and killing or loving , it' s all the same .
it simply doesn' t matter how you want to change things .
we don' t want them changed .
you do understand what has to happen ?
we have a space for you up on golgotha .
three thousand skulls there by now .
probably more .
guard .
i do wish you people would go out and count them some time .
maybe you' d learn a lesson .
probably not .
i know you .
i saw you with him .
you must be mistaken .
it wasn' t me .
it must have been someone else .
no , i' m right .
he is one of his followers .
he doesn' t know what he' s talking about .
he is one of his followers .
it' s him !
get him !
mother ?
magdalene ?
where are you ?
mother , lm sorry for being a bad son .
father , stay with me .
don' t leave me .
father , forgive them .
father !
why have you forsaken me ?
who are you ?
i' m the angel who guards you .
your father is the god of mercy , not punishment .
he saw you and said , " aren' t you his guardian angel ?
well , go down and save him .
he' s suffered enough .
remember when he told abraham to sacrifice his son ?
abraham was just about to kill the boy with his knife when god stopped him .
so , if he saved abraham' s son , don' t you think he' d want to save his own ?
he' s tested you and he' s happy with you .
he doesn' t want your blood .
he said , " let him die in a dream .
but let him live his life .
all the pain .
that was real .
yes , but there won' t be any more .
you' ve done enough .
i don' t have to be sacrificed ?
no , you don' t .
i' m not the messiah ?
no , you' re not .
what about the others ?
don' t look back there .
god gave you life .
look ahead .
where are the disciples ?
they became frightened and ran away .
ls this the world of god ?
the one i spoke about ?
no , this is earth .
why has it changed so much ?
it hasn' t changed .
you have .
now you can see its real beauty .
harmony between earth and the heart , that' s the world of god .
maybe you' il find this hard to believe ... ... but sometimes we angels look down on men and envy you .
really envy you .
what' s that ?
a wedding ceremony .
who' s getting married ?
you are .
what' s wrong ?
why are you crying ?
i' m thanking god ... ... for bringing you here .
we could have a child .
we could have a child .
where are you going ?
who are you going to kill ?
are you going to kill god ?
didn' t you hear me , jesus ?
there is nothing you can do .
god' s killed her .
god' s killed her .
god took her away when she was happy .
now she' s immortal .
she won' t see her love die or body decay .
i was there the whole time he was killing her and saw what happened .
but it wasn' t right .
it wasn' t right for god to take her .
you didn' t complain when god let you live .
you can' t complain now because he let her die .
trust god' s way .
listen .
there' s only one woman in the world .
one woman with many faces .
this one falls , the next one rises .
mary magdalene died ... ... but mary , lazarus' s sister ... ... she lives .
she' s magdalene with a different face .
she' s carrying your greatest joy inside her .
your son .
come with me .
this is the way the savior comes .
gradually , from embrace to embrace .
from son to son .
this is the road .
i understand .
mary .
look .
rabbi , i just want to see if it' s really you .
he' s real , like us .
don' t you see ?
come in .
come here .
master , i want to tell you one thing .
i' m sorry about magdalene .
i won' t ever leave you alone again .
i' il always protect you .
i don' t want you to take the wrong road and get lost again .
come inside .
i' il cook for you and your friend .
are you satisfied with me ?
do you have any complaints ?
none .
i' m ashamed when i think of it .
of what ?
of all the mistakes i' ve made .
of all the wrong ways i looked for god .
where' s mary ?
she won' t be back till this evening .
come inside .
it' s too hot out here .
come inside .
there' s only one woman in the world .
go inside .
we don' t have to get involved .
come on , stay out of it .
here , watch your brother .
remember to thank god for the food and leave some for me .
i' il be back soon .
aren' t you going to eat ?
i want to hear what he says .
you don' t have to go there .
i lied , i stole , i cheated ... ... i gambled , i whored , i drank and persecuted , tortured and murdered .
yes , murdered !
i killed anyone who broke the law of moses .
and i loved it , i enjoyed it , i relished it , i reveled in it .
because i thought i was doing god' s will .
i thought i was doing god' s will .
and the high priest of jerusalem sent me to damascus to scourge that city .
and on the road to damascus , just outside the city , in the middle of the day ... ... i was struck by a white light that blinded me !
yes .
saul , why are you persecuting me ?
why are you against me ?
who are you ? " i said .
jesus .
and he ... ... made me see .
i was led helpless like a child , into a city that i was sent to scourge .
and god sent me ananias instead ... ... and he put his hands on me and i opened my eyes ... ... and i was baptized and became paul .
and now i bring the good news to you .
it' s about jesus of nazareth .
he was not the son of mary .
he was the son of god .
his mother was a virgin .
and the angel gabriel came down and put god' s seed in her womb .
that' s how he was born .
and he was punished for our sins .
then he was tortured and crucified .
but three days later he rose up from the dead ... ... and went up to heaven .
death was conquered !
amen .
do you understand what that means ?
he conquered death .
all of our sins were forgiven ... ... and now the world of god is open to every one of us .
to everybody !
did you ever see this jesus of nazareth after he came back from the dead ?
i mean , with your own eyes ?
no , but i saw a light that blinded me and i heard his voice .
you' re a liar .
his disciples saw him .
they were hiding in an attic , the doors locked , and he appeared to them .
liar .
he' s a liar !
wait a minute .
wait a minute , i want to talk to you .
i was never crucified .
i never came back from the dead .
i' m a man .
quiet !
why are you telling these lies ?
what are you talking about ?
i' m the son of mary and joseph .
i' m the one who preached in galilee .
i had followers , we marched on jerusalem .
pilate condemned me and god saved me .
no , he didn' t .
who are you talking about ?
don' t try to tell me what happened , because i know .
i live like a man now .
i work , eat , have children .
i enjoy my life .
for the first time , i' m enjoying it .
do you understand me ?
so don' t go around telling lies about me , or i' il tell everybody the truth !
wait just a minute .
what' s the matter with you ?
look around you .
look at all these people .
look at their faces .
do you see how unhappy they are ?
do you see how they' re suffering ?
their only hope is the resurrected jesus .
i don' t care whether you' re jesus or not .
the resurrected jesus will save the world and that' s what matters .
those are lies .
you can' t save the world by lying .
i created the truth out of what people needed and what they believed .
if i have to crucify you to save the world , then i' il crucify you .
and if i have to resurrect you , then i' il do that , too .
i won' t let you .
i' il tell everyone the truth .
go ahead .
go on .
tell them now .
who' s going to believe you ?
you started all this , now you can' t stop it .
all those people who believe me will kill you .
no .
that wouldn' t happen .
how do you know ?
you see , you don' t know how much people need god .
you don' t know how happy he can make them .
happy to do anything .
he can make them happy to die and they' il die .
all for the sake of christ .
jesus christ .
jesus of nazareth .
the son of god .
the messiah .
not you .
not for your sake .
you know , i' m glad i met you .
because now i can forget all about you .
my jesus is much more important and much more powerful .
thank you .
it' s a good thing i met you .
don' t ever leave me .
i' m happy here .
i remember when mary and i planted these vines .
you know , this will all pass .
why ?
are you leaving me ?
we have to move on .
you' ve grown old .
you' ve done well .
we' ve both done well .
get inside .
get inside , fast !
jerusalem is on fire !
it' s burning !
the romans are killing everyone .
move out of the way .
we were sent here .
god told us you would show yourself to us .
he said you were dying .
peter ? ls that you ?
i can' t tell .
what happened to you ?
i got old .
you got old .
this one i know .
no matter how old you get , i know you , nathaniel .
you were the best shepherd because you had no sheep .
rabbi .
i missed you .
and you ?
they cut you .
your face .
who are you ?
john .
the romans tortured me , cut my face .
i tried to tell them all about you .
then i saw jerusalem burn .
i even saw the ark of the covenant stolen from the temple .
they destroyed the temple , just like you said .
the ark ?
there' s someone else outside .
be careful .
he' s still angry .
judas .
judas , come in .
didn' t you hear me ?
i missed you so much .
he hears you .
he just won' t say anything .
he' s been fighting in jerusalem .
look at his hands .
there' s still blood on them .
judas , the master is speaking to you .
answer him .
traitor !
your place was on the cross .
that' s where god put you .
when death got too close , you got scared and you ran away ... ... and you hid yourself in the life of some man .
we did what we were supposed to do !
you didn' t !
you' re a coward !
don' t you have any respect ?
for him ?
you don' t understand .
understand ?
you broke my heart .
sometimes i curse the day i ever met you .
we held the world in our hands .
remember what you told me ?
you took me in your arms .
do you remember ?
and you begged me , " betray me , betray me .
i have to be crucified .
i have to be resurrected so i can save the world .
i am the lamb , " you said .
death is the door .
judas , my brother , don' t be afraid .
help me go through the door .
and i loved you so much .
i went and betrayed you .
and you ...
... you ....
what are you doing here ?
what business do you have here with women , with children ?
what' s good for man isn' t good for god .
why weren' t you crucified ?
look at his wounds , judas .
they' re bleeding .
you' re hurting him .
that' s enough .
he was going to be the new covenant .
now there' s no more israel .
no , you don' t understand .
the guardian angel .
god sent a guardian angel to save me .
what angel ?
look at her .
satan .
i told you we would meet again .
if you die this way , you die like a man .
you turned against god , your father .
there' s no sacrifice .
there' s no salvation .
there' s nothing you can do .
you lived this life .
you accepted it .
it' s over now .
you just finish it and die .
die like a man .
father .
will you listen to me ?
are you still there ?
will you listen to a selfish , unfaithful son ?
i fought you when you called .
i resisted .
i thought i knew more .
i didn' t want to be your son .
can you forgive me ?
i didn' t fight hard enough .
father ... ... give me your hand .
i want to bring salvation !
father , take me back !
make a feast !
welcome me home !
i want to be your son !
i want to pay the price !
i want to be crucified and rise again !
i want to be the messiah !
it is accomplished !
it is accomplished .
