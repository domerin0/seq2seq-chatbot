' hi , everybody .
this is your cousin brucie .
whoa ! '
' our summer romances are in full bloom , and everybody , but everybody' s in love ! '
' so , cousins , here' s a great song from the four seasons . '
that was the summer of 1963 , when everybody called me " baby " and it didn' t occur to me to mind .
that was before president kennedy was shot , before the beatles came , when i couldn' t wait to join the peace corps and i thought i' d never find a guy as great as my dad .
that was the summer we went to kellerman' s .
' ping pong in the west arcade , softball in the east diamond . '
' all you sandy koufaxes , get out there ! '
' complimentary dance lessons in the gazebo . '
oh , my god .
look at that !
mom , i should' ve brought the coral shoes .
you said i was taking too much .
well , sweetheart , you brought ten pairs .
but the coral shoes matched that dress .
this is not a tragedy .
a tragedy is three men trapped in a mine or police dogs used in birmingham .
monks burning themselves in protest .
butt out , baby .
okay , we got horseshoes on the south lawn in 15 minutes !
we' ve got splish splash , the water cliffs , down by the lake .
we' ve got the still life art class .
we got volleyball and croquet .
and for you older folks , we got sacks !
doc !
max !
well , doc , after all these years i finally got you up on my mountain .
so , how' s the blood pressure , max ?
i want you girls to know if it were not for this man ,
i' d be standing here dead .
billy , get the bags .
right away , doc , right away .
i kept the best cabin for you and your beautiful girls .
hey , thanks a lot .
you want a job here ?
there' s a merengue class in the gazebo in the next few minutes .
the greatest teacher .
used to be a rockette .
it' s his first real vacation in six years , max .
take it easy .
three weeks here , it' il feel like a year .
one , two , three , four !
stomp those grapes and stomp some more !
one , two , three , four !
listen to the music !
sorry .
try your caboose and shake it loose !
one , two , three , four !
start the trance !
now come on , men !
follow me into a round robin !
ladies , the inner circle !
come on , ladies !
god wouldn' t have given you maracas if he didn' t want you to shake them !
okay now , ladies , when i say " stop " , you' re gonna find the man of your dreams .
stop !
now remember , he' s the boss on the dance floor , if nowhere else .
mom , dad , i' m going up to the main house to look around .
there are two kinds of help here .
you waiters are all college guys and i went to harvard and yale to hire you .
and why did i do that ?
why ?
i shouldn' t have to remind you .
this is a family place .
that means you keep your fingers out of the water , your hair out of the soup and show the goddamn daughters a good time .
all the daughters .
even the dogs .
schlepp ' em out to the terrace , show ' em the stars .
romance ' em any way you want .
got that , guys ?
hey , hold it !
hold it .
well , if it isn' t the entertainment staff .
listen , wise ass , you got your own rules .
dance with the daughters .
teach ' em the mambo , the cha cha , anything they pay for .
but that' s it .
that' s where it ends .
no funny business , no conversations and keep yer hands off !
it' s the same at all these places .
some ass in the woods , but no conversation .
watch it , rodriguez .
do you think you can keep that straight , johnny ?
what you can and can' t lay your hands on ?
just put your pickle on everybody' s plate , college boy , and leave the hard stuff to me .
sit down , sit down and i' il get you some wine .
thank you , max .
this is dr. and mrs. houseman , baby , lisa .
tthis is your waiter , robbie gould .
yale medical school .
robbie , these people are my special guests .

enjoy .
thanks , max .
oh , look at all this leftover food .

oh , right .
robbie , baby wants to send her leftover pot roast to southeast asia , so anything we don' t finish , you wrap up .

what do you think you' re doing ?
you' re in trouble , you talk to me .
i' il take care of it .
you should' ve come to me in the first place .
forget it , johnny .
i' m not taking what' s left of your salary .
penny , that' s my business .
besides , it wouldn' t be enough .
oh , god , it' s hopeless !
don' t say that .
there' s gotta be a way to work it out .
baby ?
is that your name ?
well , you know what , baby ?
you don' t know shit about my problems .
i told her .
jesus , billy !
now she' s gonna run and tell her little management boyfriend and then we' il all get fired .
why not skywrite it ?
penny got knocked up by robbie , the creep .
robbie ? !
look ...
no , baby , baby .
one of the counselors knows a doctor , a real md , just traveling through new paltz for one day next week .
we can get her an appointment , but it' d cost $250 .
but if it' s robbie , there' s no problem .
i know he has the money .
i' m sure if you tell him ...
he knows .
go back to your playpen ...
baby .
and just where do you get off telling me what' s right ?
but you can' t just leave her .
i mean ...
i didn' t blow a summer hauling toasted bagels just to bail out some little chick who probably ball every guy in the place .
a little precision please , baby .
some people count and some people don' t .
read it .
i think it' s a book you' il enjoy .
but make sure you return it .
i have notes in the margin .
you make me sick .
stay away from me , stay away from my sister or i' il have you fired .
what am i doing wrong ?
you' re lining it up a little wrong , marge .
you know , if your mother ever leaves me , it' il be for arnold palmer .
daddy , someone' s in trouble .
besides your mother ?
now , you' re overcorrecting , marge .
you always told me if someone was in trouble , i should try to help .
could you lend me $250 ?
are you all right , baby ?
are you in some kind of trouble ?
no , no , it' s not me .
could you loan it to me ?
that' s a lot of money , baby .
what' s it for ?
baby , stand up straight .
i can' t tell you .
it' s hard for me to say that to you , but i can' t .
you always said you could tell me anything .
i can' t tell you this .
it' s not illegal , is it ?
no , daddy .
that was a stupid thing to ask .
forgive me .
i' il have it for you before dinner .
is everything all right ?
fine .
thanks .
here' s money .
you mean robbie ?
no , you were right about him .
then where' d you get it ?
you said you needed it .
is this kid for real ?
yeah , takes a real saint to ask daddy .
thanks , baby , but i can' t use it .
what ?
what' s the matter with you ?
you should take the money .
i can only get her an appointment for thursday .
they do their act at the sheldrake on thursday night .
if they cancel , they lose this season' s salary and next year' s gig .
what' s the sheldrake ?
it' s another hotel where they do their mambo act .
can' t someone else fill in ?
no , " miss fix it " .
somebody else can' t fill in .
maria has to work all day , she can' t learn the routines .
and janet has to fill in for penny .
everybody works here .
what , do you wanna do it ?
you wanna take time out from " simon says " ?
it' s not a bad idea .
it was a joke , billy .
she can move .
no , it' s the dumbest idea i ever heard of .
i can' t even do the merengue .
see ?
johnny , you' re a strong partner .
you can lead anybody .
but you heard her .
she can' t even do the merengue .
she can' t do it .
she cannot do it .

it should be with someone ... ... it should be with someone that ... ... that you sort of love .
oh come on .
you don' t care about me .
you wouldn' t care if i humped the entire army ... ... as long as i were on the right side of the ho chi minh trail .

i' d like to shake things up a bit .
you know , move with the times .
yeah ?
yeah .
yeah ...
i' ve got a lot o ' ideas .
the ...
i' ve been working with the staff kids on a ... ... on a something like cross between this cuban rhythm and this soul dancing .
like those ...
whoa , whoa , boy .
it' s a way over your head here .
now ...
i thought , you always do the mambo , huh ?
now , why not dance this year' s final dance ... ... to the pachanga ?
right .
well , you' re free to do the same , tired number as last year if you want ... ... but next year we' il find another dance person ...
... who' il only be too happy ...
sure , neil .
no problem .
we' il end the season with the pachanga .
great idea .
sometimes he' s hard to talk to , but the ladies seem to like him .
see that he gives you the full half hour you' re paying him for , kid .
that little wimp .
he wouldn' t know a new idea if it hit him in the pachanga .
he wants some new ideas .
i could have told him some new ideas .
oh , why did you let him talk to you that way ?
what do you mean , and fight the boss man ?
yeah , tell him your ideas .
he' s a person like everyone else and ...
look , i know these people , baby .
they are rich and they' re mean .
they won' t listen to me .
well , then why not fight harder ?
make them listen .
because i need this goddamned job lined up for next summer .
my dad calls me today .
good news , " you know , he says , " uncle paul could finally get you in the union .
oh , what union ?
the house painters and plasterers , local number 179 , at your service .
i' ve been thinking a lot about the domino theory .
now , if vietnam falls , is china next ?
i don' t think they saw us .
fight harder , huh ?
i don' t see you fightin ' so hard , baby ,
i don' t see you runnin ' of to daddy tellin ' him i' m your guy .
i will .
with my father , it' s complicated .
i will tell him .
i don' t believe you , baby .
i don' t think ... ... that you ever had any intention o ' tellin ' him .
ever .
' well , cousins , it' s almost over .
labor day weekend is here . '
' and soon it' s back to the old books and back to work .
what a terrible thought ! '
hi , have you seen johnny ?
i' m sorry .
hey , well , it looks like i picked the wrong sister .
that' s okay , baby .
i went slummin ' too .
johnny !
come on !
hit me .
hit me .
johnny !
get outa here .
you' re not worth it .
you' re not worth it .
hi , vivian .
win big , moe .
as always .
yeah .
this is our last night together , lover .
i' ve got something worked out for us .
oh , excuse me , sir .
the pirate number' s next .
oh yeah , thanks .
hey , kid .
listen , you know i' m playing cards all weekend and i' ve got an all night game tonight .
why don' t you ... ... give my wife some extra dance lessons ?
i' m sorry , mr. pressman , but ... ... i' m booked up for the whole weekend , you know , with the show and everything , so i won' t have time for anything else .
i don' t think it' d be fair to take the money .
i' ve decided tonight' s the night with robbie .
he doesn' t even know yet .
oh hey , lisa ...
robie .
it' s me .
holy shit !
you wanna hear somethin ' crazy ?
come on , " and he put his arm around me ... ... just like he did with robbie .
you know how you feel when you see a patient and ... ... you think he' s all right , then you look at the x rays and this is nothing like you thought ?
what happened , max ?
it' s exactly what it' s like when you find out one of your staff' s a thief .
moe pressman' s wallet was stolen when he was playing pinochle last night .
it was in his jacket hanging on the back of his chair .
he had it at 1 : 30 and when he checked again at quarter of four ... ... it was missing .
vivian thinks she remembers this dance kid ... ...
johnny walking by .
you have an alibi for last night ?
he says he was alone in his room reading .
yeah , there are no books in johnny' s room !
there' s been a mistake .
i know johnny didn' t do it .
there' ve been similar thefts at the sheldrake and it' s happened here before .
three other wallets .
i know he didn' t do it .
stay out of it , baby .
wait .
don' t put those tables together .
come on .
daddy , i need your help .
i know johnny didn' t take moe' s wallet .
i know .
oh ?
how do you know ?
i can' t tell you .
but just please trust me , daddy .
i' m sorry , baby .
i can' t .
this danish is pure protein .
mr. kellermanm , look .
maybe johnny didn' t do it .
anyone could' ve taken it .
maybe it was , uh ...
you know , it could' ve been that little old couple , the schumachers .
i saw her with a couple of wallets .
sylvia and sidney ?
baby , you don' t go around accusing innocent people .
yeah , but i saw them .
i even saw them at the sheldrake .
didn' t you say something was stolen at the sheldrake .
i got an eyewitness and the kid has no alibi .
come on , neil .
you' il learn what it' s like to fire an employee .
no , mr. kellerman , wait a minute .
i know johnny didn' t take the wallet .
i know he didn' t take it , because he was in his room all night .
and the reason i know ... ... is because i was with him .
i told you i was telling the truth , daddy .
i' m sorry i lied to you .
but you lied too .
you' ve told me everyone was alike and deserved a fair break .
but you meant everyone who was like you .
you told me you wanted me to change the world , make it better .
but you meant by becoming a lawyer or an economist and marrying someone from harvard .
i' m not proud of myself .
but i' m in this family too and you can' t keep giving me the silent treatment .
there are a lot of things about me that aren' t what you thought .
but if you love me , you have to love all the things about me .
and i love you .
i' m sorry i let you down .
i' m so sorry , daddy .
but you let me down too .
i have been lookin ' for you all over .
they found the schumachers .
they fingerprinted their water glasses .
they found out they were wanted in arizona and florida and they made a fortune here this summer .
so then ... then it' s all right .
i knew it' d work out .
i knew they' d have to apologize ...
i' m out , baby .
they fired you anyway because of me .
and if i leave quietly , i' il get my summer bonus .
so i did it for nothing .
i hurt my family , you lost your job anyway i did it for nothing !
no , no , not for nothing , baby !
nobody has ever done anything like that for me before .
you were right , johnny .
you can' t win no matter what you do .
you listen to me .
i don' t wanna hear that from you .
you can !
i used to think so .
dr. houseman , can i , uh ...
look , i' m going anyway and ...
i know what you must be thinking ...
you don' t know anything about me .
anything at all .
i know you want baby to be like you .
the kind of person that does things to make other people look up to them .
dr. houseman , baby is like that !
i mean , if you could just see ...
don' t you tell me what to see .
i see someone in front of me who ... ... got his partner in trouble and sent her off to some butcher , while he moved on to an innocent young girl like my daughter .
yeah , i guess that' s what you would see .
well .
i can' t imagine me being here without you even one day .
well , i just think , you have more time for ... horseshoes and croquet .
maybe they' il ... saw you in seven pieces now .
i guess we surprised everybody .
i guess we did .
hardly would be sorry .
neither will l .
i' il see ya .
baby ?
i' il do your hair .
it could look pretty if ...
no .
you' re prettier your way .
this way .
kellermans , we come together
singing all as one
we have shared another season' s
talent , play and fun

good luck in medical school , son .
and i wanted to thank you for your help with the penny situation .
i guess we' ve all gotten into messes like this .
what ?
i thought baby told you .
look , i' m not sure .
i mean , penny said so , but ... ... you know with girls like that .
they' re liable to pin it on any guy around .
hello , landsman .
what' s the hot tip for the day ?
finished .
you and me , tito .
we' ve seen it all , eh ?
bubba and zeda serving the first pasteurized milk to the boarders .
through the war years when we didn' t have any meat .
through the depression when we didn' t have anything .
lots of changes , though , max .
lots of changes .
it' s not the changes so much this time , you know .
it' s ...
it' s that it all seems to be ending .
you think kids wanna come with their parents and take fox trot lessons ?
trips to europe , that' s what the kids want .
twenty two countries in three days .
it feels like it' s all slipping away .
but the heartbeats of vacation
where no cares are seen
so let' s join in just one last chorus
visitors , staff and guest
what we' ve shared won' t be forgotten
old friends are the best
join hands and hearts and voices

this year somebody told me not to .
so i' m gonna do my kind of dancin ' with a great partner ... ... who' s not only a terrific dancer ... ... but somebody who' s taught me ... ... that there are people willing to stand up for other people , no matter what it costs ' em .
somebody ... who' s taught me ... ... about the kind of person i wanna be .
miss frances houseman .
sit down , jake .
i think she gets this from me .
do you have sheet music on this stuff ?
i know you weren' t the one who got penny in trouble .
yeah ?
when i' m wrong , i say i' m wrong .
you looked wonderful out there .
now l

no , i never felt this way before
yes , i swear
it' s so true and i owe it all to you
