long is the way , and hard , that out of hell ...
leads up to light .
fuck him .
so what ?
he' s right , so far .
imagine the will it takes to keep a man bound for a full year .
to sever his hand and to use it ... to plant fingerprints .
to insert tubes into his genitals .
this guy' s methodical , exacting ... and worst of all , patient .
he' s a nut bag .
because the fucker' s got a library card doesn' t make him yoda .
you got money ?
i got 50 .
fifty bucks .
i propose a field trip .
come on .
we' il make a list .
at the top we' il put " purgatory " ...
canterbury tales , " anything relating to the 7 deadly sins .
ask yourself .
wait .
what would he study to do the things he' s done ?
what are his interests now ?
jack the ripper , for instance .
where are we going ?
library .
coupons .
coupons .

discount
discount coupons .
they must have had about 50 health violations during the last inspection .

i don' t want people thinking ... we' re dating .
give me your money .
i' il give you this , but i ought to know what are we doing .
somerset .
how you doing ?
didn' t expect a menage a trois .
it' s not a problem .
sit down .
only for you do i do this , so it' s a big risk .
so we' re in this fair and square .
it' s a deal .
about an hour .
yep .
help yourself .
that was money well spent .
yeah .
alright .
telling you this , i' m trusting you more than i trust most people .
good , ' cause i might punch you .
it' s probably nothing , but even so , it' s no skin off our teeth .
the guy in the pizza parlor is a friend from the bureau .
who , stinky man ?
for years , the fbl' s been hooked into the library system , keeping records .
assessing fines ?
no , monitoring reading habits .
look .
certain books are flagged .
books on , say , nuclear weapons ...
mein kampf " .
anyone who checks out a flagged book has his library records fed to the fbl .
wait .
how is this legal ?
legal . illegal .
these terms don' t apply .
you can' t use the information directly .
it' s just a useful guide .
it might sound silly , but you can' t get a library card without an id ... and a current phone bill .
see ?
so they run our list .
precisely .
if you want to know who' s reading ...
purgatory " , " paradise lost " and " helter skelter " ... the fbl' s computers will tell us .
it could give us a name .
of a college kid writing a term paper ... on 20th century crime .
at least you' re out of the office .
get a haircut .
how do you know this ?
i don' t .
neither do you .

you can' t go in .
we need a warrant .
we got probable cause .
come on .
think about it .
think how did we get here ?
i can' t tell anyone about the bureau .
get out of the way .
we have no reason to be here .
would you listen to me ?
get off , get the fuck off me .
alright , i' m sorry .
just pay attention a minute ?
with a hole like this , we won' t be able to prosecute .
the fucking guy' il walk .
that' s what you want ?
by the time we clear a warrant ...
fuck that .
we need a reason to knock on this door .
think about it .
okay ?
okay , okay .
you' re right .
i' m all fucked up .
when you' re right , you' re right .
well ... no point in arguing anymore .
unless you can fix that ..
you stupid son of a ...

so , yeah , i noticed ... this guy going out a lot ... when the murders were happening , so i ...
so you called det .
somerset ?
she called somerset .

we got his money .
i like it .
wait .
you won' t believe this .
we haven' t found a fingerprint .
not one .
right .
i don' t believe you .
keep looking .
we could use some more men .
i' m doing my best .
what' re you getting ?
there are 2, 000 notebooks here ... and each notebook contains about 250 pages .
what about the killings ?
what sick ridiculous puppets we are , what a gross stage we dance on .
what fun , dancing and fucking .
not a care in the world .
not knowing that we' re nothing .
we are not what was intended .
wait , there' s a lot more .
on the subway today , a man came up to start a conversation .
he made small talk , a lonely man talking about the weather and things .
i tried to be pleasant ... but my head began to hurt from his banality .
i almost didn' t notice ... but i suddenly threw up all over him .
he was not pleased ... and i couldn' t stop laughing " .
no dates .
placed on the shelves in no discernible order .
just his mind poured out on paper .
looks like a life' s work .
with 50 men reading in 24 hour shifts , it' d still ...
take 2 months .
i know .
phone ?
phone ?
phone ?
phone ?
people , quiet !
i admire you .
i don' t know how you found me , but i was surprised !
i respect you law enforcement officers more every day .
well , i appreciate that , john .
i' il be re adjusting my schedule in light of today' s setback .
i just had to call and express my admiration .
sorry i had to hurt ... one of you , but i had no choice , right ?
you' il accept my apology ?
i' d like to say more but that' d ruin the surprise .
got it .
everybody back to work .
you were right .
he' s preaching .
these murders are his sermons to us .
look , we know him .
we know him .
we know him .
who' s the blonde ?
looks like a pro .
maybe .
she caught john doe' s eye .
wild bills ' leather
he came and collected it last night .
last night ?
yeah .
this man ?
john doe , easy name to remember .
he had a limp .
what was this job you did for him ?
i' ve got a picture .
one sweet piece , actually .
i thought he was a performance artist .
you know the sort of guy that ... pisses in a cup on stage and then ... drinks it .
performance art .
right .
i think i undercharged him .
you made this for him ?
i' ve made ... weirder shit than that .
they found the blonde .
the picture !
the picture !
fucking pigs .
i need you to move .
i' il come out , but you guys ...
get the fuck out of the booth .
i' ve been in this cage the whole time .
come on , this way .
can you do something about the music ?
we' re looking for the guy .
you from homicide ?
you better see this .
get this thing off me .
oh god , get it off of me .
get him out of here , now !
i want to hear it again .
tell me again .
you heard nothing strange , saw nothing strange .
he asked me if i was married .
i saw a gun in his hand .
where was the girl ?
the what ?
what ?
the prostitute .
where was she ?
someone comes to your establishment ... they want to go downstairs , get some oo la la .
whatever .
they got to come to you .
yeah ?
yeah .
you didn' t see anyone ?
with a package ?
a knapsack ?
something under their arm ?
everybody that comes in there' s got to be a package under their arms .
some guys are carrying suitcases full of stuff .
she was just sitting on the bed .
who tied her down ?
you or him ?
do you like what you do for a living ?
all these things you see ?
no , i don' t .
but that' s life , isn' t it ?
he had a gun .
and ... he made it happen .
he made me do it .
he put that thing on me .
and he made me wear it .
then he ... told me to fuck her .
and i did .
i fucked her .
oh , god !
oh , god !
oh , god , he had a gun in my mouth .
the fucking gun was in my throat .
fuck .
oh , god .
god .
god , help me .
please , please , help me .
this won' t have a happy ending .
it' s not possible .
we catch him , i' il be happy enough .
if we catch john doe and he turns out to be the devil ... if he' s satan himself ... that might meet our expectations .
but he' s not the devil .
he' s just a man .
you know ...
you bitch and you complain and you tell me these things .
if you think you' re preparing me for hard time ... thanks , but ...
but you got to be a hero .
you want to be a champion .
people don' t want a champion .
they want cheeseburgers ...
play lotto and watch tv .
how did you get like this ?
i want to know .
it wasn' t one thing , i' il tell you that .
go on .
i don' t think i can continue to live in a place ... that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue .
you aren' t different or better .
i didn' t say i was .
i' m not .
hell , i sympathize .
i sympathize completely .
apathy is a solution .
i mean , it' s easier to lose yourself in drugs than it is to cope with life .
it' s easier to steal what you want than to earn it .
it' s easier ... to beat a child than to raise it .
love costs .
it takes effort , work .
we talk about mentally ill people .
we are talking about fucking crazies .
no , we' re not .
yes , today .
no , we' re talking about everyday life here .
you can' t afford to be this naive .
fuck off .
see , you ...
you should listen to yourself .
yeah .
you say that ... the problem is people don' t care .
so , i don' t care about people .
nonsense .
you know why ?
you care ?
want to know damn right .
you' il make a difference .
whatever .
the point is that ... you' re not quitting because you believe ... these things you say .
you want to believe them ... because you' re quitting .
and you want me to agree with you and say " you' re right , it' s all fucked up .
it' s a fucking mess .
we should all go live in a fucking log cabin .
but i won' t .
i won' t say that .
i don' t agree with you .
i do not .
i can' t .
i' m going home .
thank you , though .
i love you .
so much .
i know .
sunday
sunday
what' s your emergency ?
could you repeat that ?
i' ve done it again .
prlde
what have we got ?
sleeping pills .
glued to one hand .
telephone glued to the other .
you see what he did ?
he sliced her up .
then he bandaged her .
call for help and you' il live .
but you' il be disfigured .
or put yourself out of your own misery .
come on .
he cut off her nose .
to spite her face .
and he did it very recently .
listen ...
i' ve decided to stay on till this is done .
one of two things' il happen .
either we' il get john doe ... or he' il kill 7 and this case will never end .
don' t do me any favors .
thank you , but i got it .
i' m asking to be your partner a few more days .
you' d be doing me a favor .
you knew i' d say yes .
we' re here .
your wife called .
get an answering machine .
detective ?
after this i' m gone .
no big surprise .
detective !
you' re looking for me .
don' t fucking move .
on the floor .
stay back .
on the fucking floor .
i know you .
now .
get down .
get down on your stomach .
you piece of shit .
now !
all the way .
all the way ... fucker .
down .
faster .
faster , fucker .
now .
nose on the ground .
jesus christ .
what the fuck is this ?
i' d like to speak to my lawyer , please .
goddamn it .
he cuts the skin off the tips of his fingers .
that' s why we couldn' t ... find 1 print in his apartment .
seems he' s done that for a while .
what about the bank accounts ?
the guns ?
so far everything is a dead end .
no credit history .
no employment records .
a 5 year old bank account opened with cash .
we' ve tried tracing his furniture .
all we know about him ... is that he' s independently wealthy ... well educated ... and totally insane .
because he' s john doe by choice .
when can we question him ?
you can' t .
he goes to court now .
there' s no way he' d turn himself in .
it doesn' t make any sense .
there he sits .
it' s not supposed to make any sense .
he' s not finished .
he' s pissing in our faces and we' re taking it .
you know what i' m saying .
for the first time ever , you and i are in total agreement .
he wouldn' t just stop .
so what the fuck , man ?
he' s 2 murders away from completing his masterpiece .
we' il wait for his plea .
my client says there' re 2 more bodies .
two more victims hidden away .
my client says there' re 2 more bodies .
two more victims hidden away .
he will take detectives mills and somerset to these bodies , only them ... and only at 6 o' clock today .
why us ?
he says he admires you .
it' s part of the game .
if they don' t accept this offer , these bodies will never be found .
frankly , i' m inclined to let them rot .
we' ve got him .
downstairs , locked up .
done deal .
he' il get his free room and board , cable tv .
my wife doesn' t even have cable .
why are we discussing this ?
no .
something stinks .
and this one you .
in your $3, 000 suit ... and that smug smile on your face .
dealing for that piece of shit .
i don' t like it .
the law requires me to serve ... my clients and their interests as best i can .
we don' t make deals here , mr. swarr .
my client informs you that ... if you do not accept , he' il plead insanity .
let him try it .
i' d like to see it .
we know with the extreme nature of these crimes i' d get him off ... with such a plea .
i won' t let this conviction slide .
if you do accept under his specific conditions , he' il sign ... a full confession , plead guilty right now .
it' s your case .
make a decision .
full confession .
i' m in .
it must be both of you .
if he were to claim insanity ... this conversation is admissible .
that he' s blackmailing us with his plea .
my client wants to remind you , 2 more are dead .
the press' d love to find out the police weren' t concerned ... about finding and burying them .
if in fact there are 2 more dead .
the lab report came .
they did a quickie on doe' s clothing and fingernails .
they found blood from doe' s fingers , blood from ... the woman who' s face he cut off , and blood from ... a third party ... as yet unidentified .
you' d be escorting an unarmed man .
let' s finish it .
if john doe' s head splits open and a ufo flies out ...
i want you to expect it .
i will .
if i accidentally shaved off a nipple , would it be covered by workman' s comp ?
i suppose so .
if you were man enough to file a claim ...
i' d buy you one out of my own pocket .
i keep coming home late , my wife' il think something' s up .
you know ...
yeah .
what ?
will this wind hurt us ?
who are you , john ?
who are you really ?
what do you mean ?
at this stage , what harm can it do to tell us about yourself ?
doesn' t matter who i am .
who i am means absolutely nothing .
stay on your left up here .
where are we heading ?
you' il see .
we' re not just going to pick up 2 more bodies , are we ?
that wouldn' t be shocking enough .
you' ve got newspapers to think about , yeah ?
wanting people to listen ... you can' t just ... tap them on the shoulder anymore .
you have to use a sledgehammer .
then you' il get their strict attention .
why' re you so special that people should listen ?
i' m not special .
i' ve never been exceptional .
this is , though .
what i' m doing .
my work .
your work , john ?
yes .
see , i don' t see anything special about it , john .
that' s not true .
no , it is true .
and the funny thing is , all this work ... in 2 months , no one' il care , or give a shit , or even remember .
you can' t see the whole complete act yet .
but when this is done ... when it' s finished ... it' s going to be ...
people will barely be able to comprehend .
but they won' t be able to deny .
could the freak be more vague ?
as far as master plans go ...
i really can' t wait for you to see .
it' s going to be something .
know what ?
i' il be standing next to you .
so when this thing happens , be sure and let me know .
don' t want to miss it .
oh , don' t worry .
you won' t .
you won' t miss a thing .
what' s so exciting ?
it' s not too far now .
i' ve tried to figure something in my head .
maybe you can help me out .
when a person is insane , as you clearly are , do you know ... that you' re insane ?
maybe you' re reading ... masturbating in your own feces ...
wow , it' s amazing how fucking crazy i really am " ?
you know ?
do you guys do that ?
it' s more comfortable for you to label me insane .
it' s very comfortable .
it' s not something i would expect you to accept .
but i did not choose .
i was chosen .
whatever .
i don' t doubt that you believe that . but it seems that you' re ... overlooking a contradiction .
meaning what ?
glad you asked .
if you were chosen ... that is , by a higher ... power ... and if your hand was forced ... it seems strange to me that you' d get such enjoyment .
you enjoyed torturing those people .
that doesn' t seem to fit with martyrdom , does it ?
john ?
i doubt i enjoyed it more than det .
mills would enjoy time alone with me ... in a room without windows .
isn' t that true ?
how' d you like to ...
hurt me with impunity ?
that hurts my feelings .
i would never .
you wouldn' t only because there' s consequences .
it' s in those eyes of yours , though .
nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work .
i won' t deny my own personal desire ... to turn each sin against the sinner .
wait a minute , i thought all you did was kill innocent people .
innocent ?
is that supposed to be funny ?
an obese man .
disgusting man who could barely stand .
you' d point him out to your friends so that they' d join you in mocking him .
if you saw him while you ate , you couldn' t finish your meal .
then the lawyer .
you had to secretly thank me for that .
this is a man who dedicated his life ... to making money by lying with every breath he could muster to keep ... murderers and rapists ...
on the streets .
murderers ?
murderers , like yourself ?
a woman ... so ugly inside that she couldn' t go on living ... if she couldn' t be beautiful outside ?
a drug dealer .
a pederast , actually .
let' s not forget ... the disease spreading whore .
only in a world this shitty ... could you say they were innocent and keep a straight face .
but that' s the point .
we see a deadly sin on every street corner ... in every home and we ... tolerate it .
we tolerate it because it' s common .
it' s trivial .
we tolerate it morning , noon and night .
well , not anymore .
i' m setting the example .
and what i' ve done will be ... puzzled over ... and studied ... and followed ... forever .
yeah .
delusions of grandeur .
you should be thanking me .
why' s that , john ?
because you' il be remembered after this .
realize , detective , the only reason that i' m here now ... is that i wanted to be .
no .
we would have got you eventually .
oh , really ?
so what were you doing , biding your time ?
toying with me ?
allowing 5 " innocent " people to die until ... you felt like springing your trap ?
what was the indisputable ... evidence you were going to use on me , right before ...
i walked up to you and put my hands in the air ?
john .
calm down .
i remember us knocking on your door .
that' s right .
and i seem to remember breaking your face .
you' re only alive because i didn' t kill you .
okay .
sit back .
i spared you .
sit back .
remember that when you look in the mirror ... for the rest of your life ... or should i say for the rest of what life i allow you ... to have .
sit back , you fucking freak !
shut your fucking mouth !
you' re no messiah .
you' re a movie of the week .
a fucking tee shirt ... at best .
don' t ask me to pity those people .
i don' t mourn them any more than the 1000' s that died at sodom & gomorrah .
is that to say , john , that what you were doing was god' s good work ?
the lord works in mysterious ways .
do you see those high tension towers ?
that' s where we' re headed .
i see it .
9 o' clock , and follow that road .
there sure as shit is no ambush out here .
no fucking nothing out here .
they' il come up behind us in about 2 minutes .
i want you to go way up .
in thirty seconds , bank east on my mark .
thirty seconds .
i' il get him .
get out .
slowly .
stop .
stay .
what do you got ?
a dead dog .
i didn' t do that .
what time is it ?
why ?
i' d like to know .
7 : 01 .
it' s close .
let' s go take a look .
it' s this way .
down .
down .
down .
watch him .
there he goes .
it' s good we have some time to talk .
the guy in red .
keep the crosshairs on him .
a van' s coming down the road .
from the north .
be ready for anything .
wait for my signal .
wait for me .
get out !
out !
jesus christ , man .
don' t shoot .
step away .
turn around .
hands on your head .
what' s going on ?
why are you here ?
i' m delivering a package for this guy , david .
detective ...
david mills .
get it .
slowly .
a guy paid me $500 to bring it out here .
he wanted it here at exactly 7 o' clock .
put it down .
we got a box .
we got a box .
call the bomb squad .
bomb squad .
we got a box .
face the van .
hands up .
turn .
okay .
go .
off you go .
go .
i' m sending the driver out on foot .
he' s headed north , along the road .
have him picked up .
oh , i don' t know .
i don' t know .
i' m going to open it .
when i said i admired you , i meant what i said .
it' s blood .
you' ve made quite a life for yourself , detective .
you should be very proud .
shut the fuck up , you piece of shit .
california , stay away from here .
stay away from here , now .
don' t , don' t , don' t come in here .
whatever you hear , stay away .
john doe has the upper hand .
here he comes .
throw your gun down !
what ?
i wish i could have lived like you .
shut up .
what the fuck you talkin ' about ?
do you hear me , detective ?
i' m trying to tell you how much ...
i admire you and your pretty wife .
what ?
tracy .
what' d you fucking say ?
it' s disturbing ... how easily a member of the press can purchase ... information from the men in your precinct .
what the fuck ?
throw your gun down !
i visited your home this morning ... after you left .
i tried to play husband .
i tried to taste the life of a simple man .
throw it away !
it didn' t work out .
so ...
i took a souvenir .
her pretty head .
what' s , what' s he talking about ?
give me the gun .
what' s goin ' on over there ?
would you ...
put the gun down .
i saw you with the box .
what was in the box ?
because i envy your normal life .
put the gun down , david .
it seems that envy is my sin .
what' s in the box ?
not until you give me the gun .
what' s in the fucking box ?
he just told you .
you lie !
you' re a fucking liar !
shut up !
that' s what he wants .
he wan he wants you to shoot him .
no !
no .
you tell me .
you tell me that' s not true .
that' s not true .
become vengeance , david .
she' s all right .
you tell me .
become ... wrath .
tell me she' s all right !
if you murder a suspect , david ... you just throw it all away and he knows it .
she begged for her life , detective .
shut up !
she begged for her life ... and for the life of the baby inside of her .
he didn' t know .
give me the gun , david .
if you kill him ... he will win .
oh god !
oh god !
well , we' il take care of him .
whatever he needs .
where you gonna be ?
around .
i' il be around .
the world is a fine place and worth fighting for .
i agree with the second part .
