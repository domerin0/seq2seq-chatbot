well , um , to be quite honest
i' m thinking about getting back into law .

are you a doctor or a lawyer ?
before i went to medical school , i passed the bar in california .
i practiced law for one year then i decided why not try my hand at pediatrics ?
you' re just full of surprises .
yeah .
oh , my .
a doctor and a lawyer .
well , i' d say that brenda hit the jackpot .
where did you go to law school ?
uh , berkeley .
berkley , berkley .
oh , my gosh .
isn' t that where you went , daddy ?
maybe frank could come work for you , roger .
you' re always saying how hard it is to find assistant prosecutors .
could he , daddy ?
could he , please ?
could he come work with you , please ?
was that snake hollingsworth still teaching there when you went through berkley ?

i' m sorry .
uh ...
the dog was dead .
how unfortunate .

men like us are nothing without the women we love .
i must confess , i' m guilty of the same foolish whimsy .
i proposed to carol after five dates with two nickels in my pockets and holes in my shoes because i knew she was the one . so go ahead , frank .
don' t be afraid .
ask the question you came here to ask me .
sir , uh , uh ... w what would i have to do to take the bar here in new orleans ?

taking into account the gravity of these crimes your history of bold and elusive behavior and your complete lack of respect for the laws of the united states
i have no choice but to ignore your request to be treated as a minor and sentence you to 12 years in atlanta' s maximum security prison and recommend strongly that you be kept in isolation for the entirety of that sentence . ... " merry christmas to you .

why' d you do it ?
you' re just a kid .
i' m not your kid .
you said you were going to chicago .
my daughter can' t see me this weekend . she' s going skiing .
you said she was four years old .
you' re lying . she was four when i left .

okay .
alice , has he still not called ?
no , he hasn' t .
good morning .
i' ve , uh , called this meeting to discuss a new type of check fraud and counterfeiting which the unsub is washing and altering checks then passing them throughout arizona .
this unsub is a big dog passing checks as large as five figures .
sorry i' m late . sorry .
we have a recovered check on agent reiter' s desk .
why don' t we step out to the bullpen ?
there' s impressions on every line .
looks like the original amount was for $60 .
mind if i take a look ?
cashed in flagstaff a week ago .
cost the bank $16, 000 .
it' s a real check .
yeah .
yeah .
it' s been washed .
the only thing original is the signature .
but it' s perfect , carl .
i mean ...
i mean , this isn' t hydrochloride or bleach .
no . something new .
maybe a nail polish remover where the acetone removes the ink that' s not been printed ?
how did you do it , frank ?
how did you cheat on the bar exam in louisiana ?
i didn' t cheat .
i studied for two weeks and i passed .
is that the truth , frank ?
is that the truth ?
i' il bet this guy steals checks out of mailboxes .
he washes off their names and he puts on his own .
you' re saying that he' s a local ?
well , if it were me , you know
i' d call the bank first , i' d check out the balance ...
make sure there' s enough money in there to make it worth your while .
exactly .
you know , carl , i think this guy' s pretty smart .
i guess all we have to do now is catch him .
we' il start first thing in the morning .
we' il run the name eric anthony feeders .
in nevada , arizona , california .
both names , right ?
chris frank , too ?
yeah ...
