more news in just a minute .
jiji , i' ve decided !
i' m gonna do it tonight !
mom !
oh , hi , miss dora .
it' s gonna be completely clear tonight .
mom , i heard the weather forecast .
there' s gonna be a full moon .
kiki , did you borrow your fathers radio again without permission ?
yes , im sorry .
happy to see you miss dora .
mom , my mind is made up .
its tonight !
weren' t you gonna put it off a month ?
but the next full moon might be a cloudy night .
i want to make sure i leave on the perfect night .
wait , kiki !
my , my , whats this leaving business ?
it' s one of our old customs .
when a witch turns 13 , she leaves home for a year to begin her training .
your little baby is already 13 ?
time flies so quickly , doesn' t it ?
i' m afraid so .
but nobody leaves home that young anymore .
i remember perfectly well ... the exact day you arrived here in this town .
a little 13 year old gitl came down from the sky ... riding a broomstick , her eyes shining .
i had thought that you were a bit stuck up .
but she knows not much besides flying .
she hardly knows any of my formulas .
after i' m gone , who will make this medicine ?
sign of time i' m afraid .
everything changes , bit by bit .
but i have to say , nothing works as well for my rheumatism .
you' re always telling me to hurry !
now who' s the slowpoke ?
i think its better to leave with decorum and great dignity .
if we put it off for a month ... and i find some wonderful boyfriend , then what ?
we' il never leave !
i' m worried about once you decided , you can' t go back .
sure , i know that .
good , it' s there .
i' m so exited !
its like getting a birthday present !
oh !
dad !
you know what ?
i' ve decided to go tonight !
tonight ?
yes , i just made up my mind !
well , yes , but what about our camping trip for this weekend ?
i' m sorry !
but , ahm ....
yes , i' il expect you then .
thanks .
hi , mom .
i wanted to make sure you knew that kiki is leaving tonight .
yes , midnight .
hey , looks great !
i wish it had a different color .
witches have worn that color for over a thousand years
black cat , black clothes
kiki , it' s not important what color your dress is .
what matters is the heart inside it .
i know that having a good heart is very important .
i wish i could show you that my heart is ready .
just follow that heart and keep smiling !
jawohl !
be sure to write home as soon as you' ve found a place .
dad !
can i please take the radio ?
mom , you said i could have his radio !
yeah !
well , that radio is yours now !
okay , now let me have a look at my little witch .
you look just like your mother did when she was your age .
daddy ... would you pick me up like you used to ?
well ...
how come you never told me you were growing up so fast ?
you can always come home if things don' t work out .
come back to my old room ?
no way !
i hope you find a good town .
i bet it' s real tough to find a town to live in by yourself .
don' t worry , kiki will be fine .
what kind of town are you looking for ?
a big town ?
yeah .
by the ocean i hope .
ohhh !
i' m so jealous of you !
but i' m not going for a good time .
i' il be training hard ... at least a year !
yeah but they' il have discos , won' t they ?
kiki , its almost time .
okay .
thats the broom you' re leaving on ?
yeah , i just made it .
pretty cute huh ?
it is cute , but you can' t start witchin on a broom that' s too small .
here , better take mine .
but mom , that one' s so old !
that' s why you should have it .
it never loses its way , even in a storm .
kiki , trust me .
but i worked so hard on it , right jiji ?
your mothers broom would be better .
you rotten traitor !
kiki , he' s right .
you can make yourself another broom when you get settled down .
be careful .
go , get ' em .
good bye !
go and have a good time !
go go !
kiki ...
go go !
kiki ...
she hasn' t quite got the hang of it yet .
she' s well past the lake and doing just fine .
i' m going to miss the sound of that little bell ...
which way are we headed ?
i think south , to the ocean .
jiji , climb up and turn on the radio .
i don' t think i can right now .
klki' s dellvery servlce
good evening !
it was ....
newcomer i suppose ?
i sure am .
i just left home tonight .
would you mind turning off that music ?
i prefer to fly without accompaniment .
is it really hard to get settled in a place you' ve never been ?
oh yes , lots can go wrong .
but since i' m good at fortune telling , i can handle everything .
fortunes ?
in fact , i' ve started telling fortunes about love lately .
whats your special skill ?
oh ...
i haven' t made up my mind yet .
uh huh ?
well , i' m nearly finished with my training period .
it' il be terrific to go home with confidence .
that' s my town down there .
it' s not big or terrible interesting , but i like it .
good luck to you .
thanks !
good bye !
disgusting .
what a stuck up cat .
i have to have a special skill .
what was that about good weather ?
i hope you' re not going to do , what i think you' re going to do ? !
we' il sleep here until the storm is gone .
won' t we get into trouble ?
not if nobody finds us .
i' m soaked thorugh .
do you fell anything moving ?
this smells great !
sorry .
we didn' t mean to fall asleep in your breakfast .
jiji , you' ve got to see the ocean !
i don' t belive it !
it' s huge !
it' s only a puddle to me .
aw , come on !
that one is giant .
think there might be other witches there ?
how would i know ?
let' s go !
jiji , you allright back there ?
look !
a big town by the sea !
can you belive my luck ?
a clocktower and everything !
what if there are some witches living here ?
there may not be .
am i gonna like it here !
it' s a little big for my taste .
bless my hourglass .
if that ain' t a witch !
good morning !
are there any other witches in this town ?
no , can' t say i' ve seen a single one of ' em lately .
how about that ?
our trip is over , we' il settle down here !
thanks mister !
bye !
don' t mention it .
tell me we' re not landing down there .
of course we do .
everybody is looking at us .
i know .
smile and make a good first impression .
well , you see , i' m a witch .
my name is kiki .
this is my black cat jiji .
we' d be honored of we could live here .
we' d love to live here .
you have a wonderful bell tower .
we' re glad you like it my dear .
bye !
hey kid , what were you doing jumping into the street like that ?
you almost caused an accident .
you must be crazy , zooming around on a broom in public !
i' m a new witch , sir .
we' re supposed to fly around .
you' re supposed to obey the law the same as all other people .
what' s your name and address ?
are you gonna tell my parents ?
of course .
if its necessary .
i have to .
you' re a minor .
thief !
somebody stop him !
stop , thief !
don' t you move from there !
kiki ....
wait !
it worked out pretty good huh ?
good plan to get rid of that cop , huh ?
i was the one yelling " thief !
you are a real witch , right ?
can i take a look at that broom ?
hey tombo !
isn' t it a bit early to go on girl hunting ?
hey you guys , shut up !
let me look at your broom , please ?
just for a minute .
i didn' t ask for your help .
i guess i have to thank you ... but it was rude from you to do something without introducing yourself ?
how old fashioned .
you sound like my grandma .
go away and leave me alone !
what a cool witch !
stay here alone ?
i don' t understand .
aren' t your parents here with you ?
no .
i' m a witch , so since i' m 13 , ...
i' m supposed to be completely independant .
may i see your indentification ?
never mind then .
are you going to eat that ?
you can have it .
its going to get dark fairly soon ...
let' s go .
let' s find another town .
there must be plenty like this one , perhaps even bigger .
lady !
your pacifier !
lady !
you forgot this !
what am i going to do ?
when that baby wakes up ... and doesn' t find this , it' s gonna cry .
i' m sorry , sir , but could you wait just a minute ?
i' il be right back .
should i bring it down to her ?
what ?
the woman with the baby carriage , right ?
it' d be easy .
i' d really like to .
that' d be a big help .
thank you very much .
my pleasure .
jiji , let' s go .
wow !
sorry to startle you ... but you left this pacifier in the bakery .
here you go .
i' d like one of those .
sure .
hi !
come on in !
thank you .
thank you .
bye .
there you go
i must say , i nearly fainted when i saw you fly off .
that woman told me to give you this message right away .
i got the pacifier you sent ...
be sure to thank your little friend .
she' s an absolute angel .
i' m glad i could help .
bye .
where are you going so fast ?
wait , please have something to drink !
come up here .
sit down and relax .
want some hot chocolate ?
yes ...
thank you .
and this is for you .
let me guess , you' re a witch in training ?
yes , but people don' t seem fond of witches in this town .
there are many kind people in this town who will like you .
take me for instance .
i like you very much .
have you found a place to stay yet ?
you should have told me you hadn' t .
we have a vavant room in the attic you can stay in .
you' d give me a room ? !
i' d be happy to .
let me introduce myself .
i' m , osono .
my name is kiki , and this is my cat jiji .
its not very clean at the moment , but its all yours .
thanks .
bathroom and water are downstairs .
don' t hesitate to ask for anything .
thank you !
there' s flour everywhere .
at this rate , i' il be a white cat by morning .
jiji , come take a look at the ocean from here .
shall we try to find another town ?
what a snob she is .
i' ve decided not to leave this town .
maybe i can find others like osono ... who will accept me for what i am .
how much do you think a phone would cost to put up here ?
a phone ?
yeah , for my business .
good morning everyone .
did you sleep well ?
yes .
that smells good .
can i help out ?
a delivery service , huh ?
i have one skill flying so i thought ... a delivery service would be a good idea .
everyone will love it .
kiki' s flying deivery service .
and you can base your business out of you room upstairs ... if you want to .
if i want to ? " oh boy !
i' d like to put a phone up there .
but a phone costs money .
i' ve some saved up already .
don' t waste it .
why not use our phone ?
it takes time to get regular costumers .
if you help in the bakery ... you won' t have to pay the phone bill .
i need a lot of help since i' m expecting a baby .
and i' il throw in free breakfast too .
thank you !
i' il do my very best for you !
you' re such a wonderful person .
jiji , come on !
i' m all alone .
it' s time to go shopping .
stop jumping out on the street .
we' re not at home .
i' m sorry .
i won' t do it again .
i wish i had something pretty to wear besides this robe .
boy , this is expensive ...
kiki , look , its me !
do you have any money left ?
a little .
we just have to eat pancakes for a while .
wow !
those are beautiful .
wait !
pull over a second .
hey yo !
miss witch !
turn around !
no flying today ?
what did i tell you ?
black is all she wears .
wait !
come back !
i' m sorry , i was only kidding !
kiki , perfect timing .
a lady wants you to deliver something .
she' s your first customer .
customer ?
i' il be right back !
the map !
this lady is a customer of ours .
we were talking about your delivery service .
you are a cute little witch .
my name is kiki , ma' am .
i' ve heard wonderful things about you .
could you deliver this tonight ?
yes .
it' s my nephews birthday .
and urgent job came so i can' t get there myself .
where do you want it delivered ?
thats me ....
it won' t be too far ?
i ca fly there directly from here .
how much do you want ?
i haven' t really set a price yet .
is this enough ?
this is more than ehough .
thank you very much ma' am .
oh wow !
that' s great .
i certainly wish that i could fly ...
yeah !
hey , do you know that girl ?
how high do you intend to go ?
its my first delivery .
i don' t want to be stopped by that police officer .
i was afraid you were going to deliver this to the angels .
i' m guessing its just beyond the cape .
here we go !
jiji , i' m liking this town more and more .
i' m not suer what i think .
i' il finally be able to write mom .
those are wild geese .
wonderful !
they' re flying along with us !
why are they so upset ?
they say a wind is comming .
they also say they' re going higher .
i' m sorry !
i oww , oww !
please !
i' m sorry !
i wasn' t trying to steal your eggs !
i' ve never been so scared .
its your fault .
they warned us of that wind , but you didn' t listen .
you' re right .
that' s beautiful .
they were able to fly that high up with the wind .
kiki !!
the toy is gone !
what ?
oh no !
we' ve got to get back to where we fell !
they' re saying " the egg thief is coming again !
what are we gonna do ?
hey !
don' t do that !
stop it !
stop it !
go away !
we' re in trouble .
they' re still upset .
witches get no respect these days .
crows used to be witches servants .
that was a long time ago , okay ?
how about we go in after the forest is dark , get in and get out ?
we' il never make it in time .
there' s only one way to do it .
they' il find out i' m a fake !
after i find it , i' il be right back to help you out .
is that the place ?
yes .
don' t move a muscle .
can i breathe ?
hold it as long as you can .
yea !
give me my present !
that' s pretty weird .
a bit late aren' t you ?
after my sister telephoned we were wondering where you were .
i' m sorry .
oh .
could i please have your signature ?
mom , can i put the canaries in here ?
uh huh , but be careful you don' t let any of them escape .
okay .
thank you , have a nice day .
come on birdie !
i' m gonna put you in a bigger house !
kiki , please hurry !
i know it was here , so it' s gotta be around somplace .
there it is !
excuse me , anybody home ?
can you please help me ?
anybody ?
anybody here ?
yeah !
i can' t come down right now .
but why don' t you come up ?
what do you want ?
that stuffed black cat you put behind your window ?
i' m sorry , but its mine .
i dropped it .
be good , and don' t move yet .
i found it in the forest .
would you give it back to me , please ?
hang on a minute , i just can' t stop just now .
nice , very nice .
you' re beautiful just the way you are .
you really should have told me you were in a hurry .
i got sort of fond of it .
i' m sorry .
the stuffing is coming out !
i' d bet the crows did it .
they were making a big fuss over it .
what am i gonna do ?
i can' t deliver it like this .
say , how about we work out a deal ?
that' s pretty exciting .
and at 13 too !
to be completely independant .
that' s great .
can you fix it ?
trust me .
ketto !
ketto !
time for your bath .
the guests will be here soon !
ketto !
i' m done !
thank you so much !
you' d better help jiji before it' s too late !
but i haven' t finished yet .
you' ve done enough .
go help him !
thanks !
jeff likes my present more than me !
it is strange you know .
he adores that stuffed cat .
he won' t leave it alone .
he thinks its a puppy ?
your sister is not going to be happy to hear that .
thats okay .
i gave it to jeff anyway .
remember to tell auntie " thank you " .
you should be nice to him .
jeff is a very old dog .
but grandma , all he does is sleep !
ketto , go open the door .
jeff wants to go out .
be sure to push the door shut when you finished .
jiji !
what took you so long ?
i' m sorry .
that marvelous dog helped me escape .
he said he' d be happy to help us out if he could .
would you take this back in ?
whats the matter ?
i' m famished .
yeah , me too .
and i' m tired too .
but it sure was a wonderful adventure .
and that painter ... who found the stuffed cat wants to do a drawing with me in it .
naked ?
don' t be silly .
kiki' s flying delivery sevice
boring ...
what are you doing ?
you are supposed to be minding this shop .
i am .
but nobody is coming in today .
but it always gets busy around now .
i know . but that' s not what i mean .
i mean my customers .
jiji , if nobody comes , i' il have to eat pancakes forever ... and be fat , fat , fat .
so what am i supposed to do ?
i think pancakes are great , providing they' re not burned of course .
you' re no help .
when you get fat see if i care ...
beautiful , isn' t she ?
somebody told me she' s a fashion designer .
personally i' m not very fond of her conceited cat .

oh , i' m sorry .
osona !
i got an invitation to a party at tombo' s flying club .
terrific .
you' il have a wonderful time .
but what am i gonna wear ?
kiki , i wouldn' t worry too much .
you look fine in that .
it makes you look beautiful and mysterious .
you mean it ?
any work yet ?
i almost forgot about it !
it' s already 4 : 00 !
oh no !
can you watch the store till i get back ?
jiji , jiji !
why are you going to that party when you' re so mad at him ?
i have to concentrate .
this thing is so heavy so be quiet .
thank you .
come on !
our next appointment is at 4 : 30 .
there' s the blue roof !
someone telephoned for a delivery service , so here i am .
my name is kiki .
right this way dear .
you' re right on time .
yes ma' am .
madam , the delivery girl is here .
what ?
oh my goodness .
is it that time already ?
what a pleasant surprise .
make yourself at home my dear .
come , come .
yes .
may i take that for you ?
broom and black cat .
it' s just like my grandmother always told me .
my name is kiki .
i' m a witch .
oh , but what a cute little girl you are .
i' m sorry but the pie you were supposed to deliver isn' t ready yet .
the temperature doesn' t see to go up at all .
somethings wrong .
machines don' t work when they become old like me .
i was hoping you could deliver it hot to my grandchilds birthday party .
its one of my favourite recipes : " herring and pumpkin pie
i guess i have to admit defeat .
i' il have to phone her and tell her i' m sorry .
i feel just awful having you come here for nothing .
bertha !
bertha !
would you get her money ?
certainly , ma' am .
all of it .
pay her the amount we agreed on .
oh no .
please !
now , don' t be silly .
it' s not your fault it wasn' t ready .
i have no other jobs today .
maybe i could help .
does that oven over there work ?
you mean that one ?
it used to be the only one i ever used , but i haven' t opened it in years .
if it burns firewood , i can help .
i used to help my mom all the time .
it' s a big job to build a fire .
it' s a great idea madam .
i never did like that electric thing , and we do have plenty of firewood .
i can build a fire .
well , i' m not sure ... but if you think you can build it ?
have you considered that this might make you late for your party ?
i can' t take money for nothing .
come on .
we have to hurry up .
look what i found .
and it works !
you' re very good at this , my dear .
your mother taught you very well .
oh my goodness .
it' s so exciting !
never did like electricity .
it should be about time .
yes , very good .
well done .
and now we wait .
about 40 minutes or so , right ?
exactly right .
so , why don' t we take a little break ?
do you need help with anything else ?
oh !
well , if you really like to ...
thanks very much .
you' re very welcome .
you' re going to be late for the party .
stop worrying .
it' il only take 15 minutes if i fly there fast .
would you care for some tea ?
i just made it fresh .
i just remembered .
won' t you be late for your party ?
it won' t be a problem .
it' il take me 15 minutes from here .
but my dear , that clock runs about 10 minutes slow !
hm ? !
what' il i do !
see if the pie' s ready .
okay .
bertha !
bertha !
is the pie ready ?
it smells fine , so you' d better hurry .
yes .
better hurry !
come on !
yes .
don' t forget your money .
that' s way too much !
not for what you' ve done .
hurry up kiki , or you' il be late !
have a giid time !
be careful .
what happened to all the good weather ?
my whiskers are tingling !
can' t we get out of the rain ?
we can' t !
that' il only make us later .
besides , the food will get cold if we stop .
yes , what is it ?
i have a delivery .
but , it' s completely wet .
i' m sorry .
it began to rain on the way , but the food came through all right .
i told grandma i didn' t want that .
who is it ?
oh boy !
grandma sent over another one of her crummy herring pies again .
um , could you please sign this receipt for me ?
i hate grandma' s stupid pies .
she can' t possibly have been her granddaughter .
do you think we can still make it in time ?
kiki look , tombo is down there !
we can still make it .
that certainly was quite an ordeal .
that boy waited a very long time .
doesn' t matter anyway , i can' t go in these wet clothes .
what' s wrong , kiki ?
do you have a headache ?
why don' t you grab a bite to eat , i know i' m famished .
kiki !
not feeling well , huh ?
you have quite a fever .
is someone pounding on my head ?
i' il bet you never dried yourself off completely yesterday .
am i gonna shrivel up and die ?
you have a cold , is all .
i' il bring up some medicine .
and you could eat something .
i' m not hungry .
it' il be better if you eat now .
how about some oatmeal with raisins ?
like some , jiji ?
oatmeal is the best thing for a cold .
there you go , jiji .
don' t burn your tongue .
come and eat your oatmeal before it gets cold .
do i have to eat ?
if you want to get well .
that boy was in the shop a while ago this morning .
when i told him you were sick ... he asked how a witch could catch a cold .
oh yes , and he said he wanted to visit you a little later .
oh no !
i figured you might say that ... so i politely refused .
you' re tired .
just realx and sleep .
i' il just open this window so you have a little air .
osono .
hmm ?
um , never mind .
jiji !
jiji !
what ?
jiji , breakfast is ready .
kiki ?
feeling better this morning ?

i' m sorry , i didn' t realize i overslept .
thath' s okay .
come down here .
i have a favor to ask of you .
yes .
koppori " , is that right ?
uh huh .
is this enough money ?
that' s allright .
it' s close enough to walk from here .
don' t be silly , work is work .
and be sure to deliver it to him direct .
jiji !
you have work ?
it' s not far away .
who' s your friend ?
lily is her name .
i' il be down .
don' t worry , i' il be back in a minute .

i' il be right with you .
i' il bet osono planned this .
gee , thanks a lot .
i want to apologize for making you wait the other night .
i' m sorry you got wet .
want to camo over to my place ?
i have something to show you .
come on !
hurry !
that party was to celebrate the completion of this thing .
this is the engine of a man propelled plane .
like it ?
we' re assembling the wings and the frame at somebody else' s house .
i' m planning on flying this thing during my sommer vacation .
i got it .
let' s go to the beach ... where that dirigible made a forced landing !
dirigible " ?
you didn' t see it on tv ?
i was sleeping .
then we have to go .
we' re going with this ?
why not ?
i have to practice anyway .
gotta build up my legs .
okay , ready ?
i' ve never ridden a bicycle before .

even better !
brace the bike with your foot until i get her revved up .
let' s go !
okay !
should i get off ?
no !
go faster , go !
swing your body to the inside when we go around the curve .
otherwise it won' t turn very well .

we' re flying !
tombo , are you okay ?
yeah , are you allright ?
i' m okay .

i' m sorry , but when we flew over that cliff , i was so scared !
i was scared too .
i' il bet you used some magic .
i' m not sure , i was so frightened .
your poor bike .
it' s a mess .
oh , no !
am i in trouble !
will you look after my bike for me ?
what went wrong ?
i pedaled too hard .
that' s why it busted .
wait there !
sure ... would be terrific to go around the world in a drigible like that .
how did it make you feel , the first time you ever went flying ?
i can' t recall .
i was too young to remember .
but my mom told me i wasn' t scared a bit .
gosh , i sure wish i was born into a witch family .
you can just fly away on a broomstick , but me
that' s all i can do .
i don' t find flying that much fun .
it' s more of a job to me .
it' s not fun for you , but i' d think it would be putting your talents to work .
i sort of feel my confidence slipping .
but i' m glad i came with you today .
i feel better sitting by the ocean .
i could bring you here anytime you want ... and train at the same time .
you' re a very nice person .
you just found out ?
i used to think you were some sort of clown .
my mom says the same thing .
you clown !
quit looking up to the sky and get back to your books !
tomba !
hey , guess what !
what ?
something good !

i' il be right back .
wait here .
they said we could go in the dirigible .

i' m not mad at all .
i have lot of work to do , so just leave me alone .
tombo , forget her .
come on .
jiji , i think somethings wrong with me .
i make friends , then suddenly i can' t bear to be with any of them .
seems like that other me , the cheerful and honest one went away somewhere .
some friend you are ...
jiji , i don' t care if you have a girlfried .
you can' t be late for every meal .
and clean up after yourself .
what are you talking like a cat for ?
jiji ?
oh no !
talke to me !
you mean you can' t speak anymore ?
jiji !
i wonder what happened to him .
i can' t figure out a word he says anymore .
oh my gosh !
i' m losing my witchs powers .
you can' t fly anymore ?
have you lost your magic ?
it has become very weak , so i think i' ve gotta take a break from delivery work .
but i' il work really hard in the bakery , so please let me stay in my room !
of yourse you can stay .
will your power come back after you' ve rested ?
i don' t know .
maybe .
i can make another broom , but ...
look !
kiki ?
it' s me , tombo .
i was waving at you from the dirigible .
did you see me today ?
the captain allowed me into the control cabin during the test flight .
it was great !
hello ?
are you there , kiki ?
please , don' t call me anymore .
what ?
i can barely hear you .
the captain said he' d like to meet you .
what ?
hey , come on !
don' t hang up !
what' s wrong ?
you don' t look like you feel well .
i' m still training to be a witch .
if i lose my magic that means ...
i' ve lost absolutely everything .
kiki !
hi !
you didn' t come pay me a visit , so i had to come visit you !
i' m sorry .
well , i also came ... to shop a little .
come on in .
i' m done now .
we can take a break .
you' d better believe i will .
nice place you have .
help yourself to these .
i' il make some fresh tea .
no tea , thanks .
do yuo have some milk ?
sure .
well , well , positively amazing .
he' s the spitting image of that stuffed cat .
you' re jiji , right ?
how' s the home delivery business ?
that' s bad huh ?
i' m not working much now .
i thought you seemed depressed .
i didn' t know ... things like that happened to witches .
hey !
why not come and stay at my little place ?
tell your boss you need a break .
they can live without you for a night .
how about it , pussy cat ?
rather be with yuor girlfriend , huh ?
come on , let' s go !
hurry , the bus ...
i' m bushed .
it' s so beautiful here .
must' ve been blind , with two beautiful girls wating in front of him .
what do you mean , you thought i was a boy ?
well , look at the way you' re dressed .
tell me , what kind of boy has these legs , mister .
crows !
we' ve become very close firends .
wow !
hello everybody .
we' re home again .
good afternoon .
i' m sorry i bothered you before .
make yourself at home while i get some water .
like it ?
amazing !
i got the idea for it ... after we met the first time .
but i really haven' t got the girls face right .
i' ve been waiting for you to come back to get it right .
you mean that' s me ?
yes , it is .
would you be my model ?
but i' m not very beautiful .
why do you want me ?
you' ve got a great face .
besides , it' s prettier than it was the last time .
come on , don' t be scared .
sit here .
lift up your head a little .
look beyond the horizon .
don' t move .
very good .
painting and magical powers seem to be very similar .
sometimes i can' t paint a thing .
you mean it ?
then what happens ?
kiki , don' t move , don' t look over here .
without even thinking about it i used to be ableto fly .
now i can' t even begin to remember how i ever managed to do it .
at times like that , you know what i do ?
paint .
that gets rid of my frustrations .
but still , if i can' t fly
then i just stop .
take long walks , look a the scenery , doze off at noon .
don' t do a single thing .
then suddenly , you' il be able to fly again .
maybe that' il help .
trust me , it' il happen !
come on .
don' t ruin the pose !
when i was your age , i' d already ... decided to become an artist .
i loved painting .
i even painted in my sleep .
then one day , for no reason , i became unable to paint .
so i painted and painted some more , but none of it was good .
they were copies of paintings i' d seen somewhere before .
just copies of ones i' d seen somewhere .
i swore i' d paint my own pictures .
that must have been hard .
but after that .. its not much easier now .
i think i found what painting means , at least for me .
to fly , you do chant a spell or something , right ?
mm hmmm .
we fly with our spirit .
the witch' s spirit ?
perfect , that' s what i' m talking about .
the spirit of witches , the spirit of artists , the spirit of bakers .
i suppose it must' ve been a power given by god .
sometimes , you suffer for it .
i guess i never gave witchcraft much thought .
that talk about discipline and training was so old fashioned .
i was so happy when you came all the way to see me .
if i had been alone tonight , i would' ve been one giant ball of frustration .
there have been many times i' ve thought of painting over that painting .
why ?
it' s so beautiful .
you know when i found you today , i looked at your face and thought
i' ve found it !
i knew i could paint you .
but that' s not fair !
all' s fair in love and art .
let' s go to sleep .
allright .
sorry about taking your bed from you .
don' t worry about it .
can i visit you once in a while ?
sure .
anytime during the summer .
that is , if i can visit you , too .
uh huh .
the intercontinental dirigible freedom adventurer , recently downed in a spectacularly forced landing due to the terrential rains has now been repaired .
hello .
guitiokipan bakery
ah , kiki .
how was it ?
mm .
take plenty of time and get rested up .
that elderly lady .... you made a delivery for has something else for you to take .
should i tell her no ?
i' ve told her you' d be away for some time , but she kept insisting .
then stop by on your way back .
bye .
afternoon , ma' am .
well , well .
we' ve been expecting you .
come in .
very nice to see you again , ma' am .
i' m glad you came .
excuse me for not standing , but ... my legs are bothering me more than usual .
bertha , bring the package .
yes yes .
i hope it hasn' t taken off yet !
not yet .
bertha is absolutely mad about lighter than air travel .
i' m the adventuresome type .
turn the volume down .
kiki , would you open the box ?
yes .
you want me to deliver it ?
would you please deliver it to a girl named kiki ?
she was kind to me and a tremendous help .
its may way of saying " thank you " .
and would you find out when her next birthday may be ?
then i' il be able to bake her another one .
kiki .
i will , i will .
and i' m sure kiki ... will want to know the ladys birthday ... so she' il be able to give her a present .
you' ve got a deal .
what happened ?
there' s been a trerrible catastrophe .
oh no !
the tie down ropes holding the blimp are breaking one by one !
it' s drifting straight toward our television cameras .
my god it' s going to
oh , they always leave me hanging at the most exciting part !
these winds always come in midsummer .
they will be hitting us pretty soon .
don' t worry , it' il pass by quickly .
oh goody , it' s back on .
look !
look at that , it' s complete upside down !
it is like a balloon in that position
it has broken loose from its mooring and drifted into an upside down position .
a last ditch effort is being made to tie the dirigible down and keep it from drifing away .
it' s extremely doubtful whether it can be done oh no !
it' s useless !
tombo !
that' s my friend tombo holding on to that rope !
... attached to the end of the cable as though it were a toy !
there' s a ... young boy hanging on to the cable !
he' s being lifted away with the police car !
are you sure that s your friend ?
i have to go .
be careful !
oh dear , what' s happening ?
hold on there , son !
just hold your grip steady !
release the helium from the tail !
tombo !
any word about the boy hanging on the rope ?
the latest report is that the police car dropped into the pool !
clear the street !
get on the sidewalk !
are you feeling allright ?
please sir , may borrow your broom ?
huh ?
i promise i' il bring it back .
well , i suppose that' s okay .
thank you very much !
fly !
oh my goodness !
straighten up and fly straight or i' il burn you !
the boy appears to be safe , but the dirigible is on a collision yourse direvtly for the clock tower .
if the wind doesn' t shift direction it will surely smash into the tower !
we gotta get up higher .
we' re gonna hit the tower !
there' s not enough helium !
before we hit , jump onto the tower !
aye aye , captain !
hey there , over here !
come on !
get out of the way !
grab hold of this !
that way !
hurry !
oh no !
??
that sound is the helium gas leaking .
the condition of the boy is unknown .
from where i' m standing oh no !
too much gas has escaped and it' s falling !
it' s snagged on a nother building !
hey look !
ober there !
it' s a miracle !
the boy has managed to keep hold of the rope !
but how can anyone rescue him ther now ?
that boy is holding on for dear life .
something just flew by !
is it a bird ?
no no , it' s not a bird , it' s a young girl !
yes , there' s a young girl soaring through the sky !
kiki , go !
go !
she can fly now !
get ' em kiki !
tombo !
kiki !
come on , be a good broom and help me out !
hang on young fella , don' t give up !
hold on , she' s almost there !
tombo !
kiki !
hold on , don' t give up now !
don' t give up , son !
she caught him in midair !
i' ve never seen anything so amazing !
that broom is mine .
i gave it to her myself !
