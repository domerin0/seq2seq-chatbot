garbage .
all i' ve been thinking about all week is garbage .
i can' t stop thinking about it .
what kind of thoughts about garbage ?
i just ...
i' ve gotten real concerned over what' s gonna happen with all the garbage .
i mean , we' ve got so much of it .
you know ?
i mean , we have to run out of places to put this stuff eventually .
the last time ...
i started feelin ' this way is when that barge was stranded and , you know , it was goin ' around the island and nobody would claim it .
do you remember that ?
yes , i remember .
do you have any idea what may have triggered this concern ?
yeah .
yeah .
you see , the other night john was taking out the garbage , and he kept spilling things out of the container , and that made me ...
i started imagining , like , a garbage can that produces garbage .
and it doesn' t stop , it keeps producing garbage .
and it keeps overflowing .
and , you know , what would you do to try to stop something like that ?
ann , do you see any pattern here ?
what do you mean ?
well , last week we were talking about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities .
now we' re talking about your concern over the garbage problem .
yeah ...
so ?
well , if you think about it , i think you' il see the object of your obsession is invariably something negative which you have no control over .
yeah , but how many people do you think run around obsessing over how great and how happy things are ?
you know , i mean , maybe they do , but i don' t think they' re in therapy .
anyway ... bein ' happy isn' t all that great .
i mean , the last time i was really happy , i got so fat .
i must' ve put on 25 pounds .
i thought john was gonna have a stroke .
so , what are you worried about ?
what am i looking at here ?
is this a mistake ?
depends on your point of view .
i don' t think so .
in fact , i' m gonna tell you a little secret .
as soon as you get a ring on your finger , you start getting spectacular attention
from the opposite gender .
that' s bullshit !
seriously .
i wish i had super bowl seats for every time some filly had come up and talked to me without the slightest provocation .
it' s just marvellous .
that happened before you got married .
no , no , no .
it never happened before i got married .
if i' d known , i' d have bought a ring when i was 18 and saved myself ...
yeah , right ! ... a lot of time and money .
no , i wish somebody' d clued me in .
i' m tellin ' you .
it' s too weird .
oh , shit , i gotta be someplace .
so , racquetball thursday , right ?
how about 7 . 30 ?
yeah , fine .
see you later .
bye .
bye bye .
yes , sir ?
janet .
reschedule kirkland for , uh , friday , 1 . 30 .
yes , sir .
all right .
are you still keeping these thoughts from john ?
yeah .
are you afraid of his finding you silly at thinking these things ?
no , it' s not that .
it' s just ...
i' m really angry at him right now .
why ?
he invited this college friend of his to stay at our house and didn' t even ask me .
i' m gonna say yes , of course , but ... you know , it just would' ve been nice to have been asked .
what upsets you about that ?
i guess it makes me angry because i can' t justify bein ' angry .
it' s his house .
he pays the mortgage .
yes , but he asked you to quit your job , and you do have housework .
yeah .
i have housework .
that' s true .
this unexpected guest notwithstanding , how are things with john ?
oh , they' re fine .
ex cept for i' m going through this thing where i don' t want him to touch me , but ...
when did you begin having this feeling ?
well ... last week .
i don' t know , i just ...
i got this really strange feelin ' , and ... ugh ... just didn' t want him to touch me .
prior to this feeling , were you comfortable with contact with john ?
oh , yeah .
sure .
yeah .
ex cept for ... well ...
i' ve never really been that much into sex .
i mean , i like it and everything , but ...
you know , i just don' t think it' s such a big deal , and ...
i wouldn' t miss it , you know , kinda thing .
but lately i' ve just ... been kinda curious about how things have slacked off .
perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched .
but that' s the weird thing , because he started not touching me before i started feelin ' like that .
ah .
i mean , i' m sure he probably wishes that i would initiate things once in a while , and i would , ex cept for it just never occurs to me , and ... well , the few times i have felt like it i was by myself .
did you do anything ?
what do you mean ?
did you masturbate ?
oh !
oh .
oh .
god , no .
no .
mm mm .
i take it from your response that you never masturbate .
well ...
i tried once .
it just seems so stupid !
i don' t know !
it just seemed like a dumb thing to do , and ...
god , and then i started worrying that my dead grandfather was watching me , and ...
it seemed so stupid , especially when you don' t know what to do with the garbage .
oh , so it was recently when you tried this ?
oh , well , it was kind of recently , but not ... real recently .
i am just not up to havin ' a guest in the house .
i gotta go .
i gotta go to the office .
i gotta get back to the office .
i only get one today ?
gee , how ex citing .
i already skipped one meeting .
i gotta get back .
look , john , if you wanna leave , leave .
my life doesn' t revolve around these little get togethers .
don' t flatter yourself .
don' t feel like you gotta treat me with kid gloves .
tell me how you really feel .
listen , i got a friend comin ' into town , an old friend i haven' t seen in years .
from what i can tell , i think he' s a little lost .
i think i may have to spend a little time with him .
mm hm .
meaning we' il have to cool it for a while ?
yeah .
yeah .
i wish you' d quit that bartending job of yours .
why ?
i hate the thought of all those guys hittin ' on you .
i can handle it .
i' m sure .
besides , the money is good , and some of the guys are cute .
and you are in no position to be jealous .
who said i was jealous ?
i did .
you know , i' d like to do it at your house sometime .
i must admit , the idea of doin ' it in my sister' s bed gives me a perverse thrill .
i wish i could just come right out and tell everyone ann' s a lousy lay .
the beautiful , the popular ann bishop millaney .
could be risky .
how about i just start a rumour , then ?
no , no , i mean doin ' it at my house .
afraid of gettin ' caught ?
yeah !
you should be .
can i meet this friend of yours ?
who , graham ?
i gotta tell you , we were very close many years ago , but i ...
i think we' re very different now .
yes ?
ann ?
uh , my name is graham dalton .
oh !
yeah , sure .
may i use your bathroom ?
uh huh .
come on in .
where is it ?
oh , back there to the left .
i' m sorry .
do you like strawberries ?
i brought you some .
thank you .
that' s real sweet .
hi .
um , john millaney , please .
this is his wife .
that' s all right .
thank you .
well .
that was quick .
false alarm .
have a seat .
i' m sorry , we don' t let people smoke in the house .
but if you' d like to , we could go outside .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
no , no .
i ...
i can wait .
i' m ...
do you have any other things ?
yes .
oh , you mean to bring in ?
no .
i do have some other things , but i don' t ...
this is all i need to stay here .
have you ever been on television ?
television ?
no , no .
why ?
i was just curious .
graham .
that' s an unusual name .
yeah .
yeah , i , uh ...
i guess it is .
my mother is a complete anglophile .
anything british makes her drool like a baby .
so she , you know , i think she heard the name in a movie or something .
she' s a prisoner of public television now .
how do you like being married ?
i like it just fine .
what about it do you like ?
i ...
i don' t mean to be critical .
i' m curious .
no , no , no , no .
that' s ok .
uh ...
well ... you know the cliche about the security of it ?
well , that' s true .
and , um , we own this house .
it' s a nice house .
and ...
john was just made junior partner , and i really like that .
you know , i like the fact that he' s just not , you know , freelance or whatever .
yes .
so , how long has it been since you' ve seen john ?
nine years .
nine years ?
yeah .
i was surprised he invited me to stay here until i found a place .
didn' t you know him very well ?
oh , no , i knew him very well .
john and i ... were very much alike .
really ?
that' s kinda hard to believe .
i mean , you just seem so different now .
yeah .
well , i would imagine we are pretty different now .
i' m ready to use the bathroom , finally .
ok .
graham .
i gotta tell you , i almost called the cops when i saw you today .
i thought to myself " this couldn' t possibly be the same guy that once held private services in the back of the chapel on a weekly basis " .
you did that ?
everybody has a past .
that' s mine , so ...
so , what' s with the get up ?
somebody die , or ... ?
john !
i' m sorry .
did ... ?
i' m sorry .
no , no , no .
nobody died .
so ...
i mean ... what do you think the greeks' d think of this rather sombre attire ?
i don' t know .
dinner was very good .
yeah , it wasn' t bad , honey .
usually ann achieves a kinda critical mass with the salt , but , uh , tonight was ...
i always tell her , you can always add more , but you can' t take it away .
yeah , you say that , don' t you ?
so , do you have family here ?
mm .
mother , father , my sister .
sister older or younger ?
younger .
are you close ?
i' m sorry .
i' m ...
i' m prying again .
i' m sorry .
were you prying before ?
i was grilling ann about your marriage .
how' d it go ?
well , i ...
very well .
uh ...
so , i was asking about your sister .
yeah .
well ...
we get along all right , it' s just that , uh ...
well , i think she' s an extrovert .
i just think she' s loud .
she probably wouldn' t agree .
no , i mean , definitely wouldn' t agree .
so , listen , are you gonna see elizabeth while you' re here ?
uh ...
i don' t know .
who' s elizabeth ?
a girl graham dated in school .
well after the chapel episodes .
she still lives here , to the best of my knowledge .
so graham and i were talking about apartments , and i told him that they' ve got lovely little apartments in the garden district .
and they got nice garage apartments ...
there' s critical crime in that district .
oh , john , come on , that is not true .
no .
there are ...
i don' t know what kind of place you' re lookin ' for .
there' s plenty of apartments ...
... in any one place .
i' m sorry ?
no , i just ...
right now i have one key , you know , everything i own is in the car .
i like that .
if i get an apartment , that' s two keys .
if i get a job , you know , i might have to open or close .
that' s more keys .
i buy some stuff , i' m afraid it' s gonna get ripped off , and i get more keys .
i just like having the one key .
it' s clean .
you don' t have to worry about losin ' ' em .
get rid of the car when you get the apartment .
still one key .
i like having the car .
you know ?
the car' s important .
you gotta be mobile .
in case you have to leave someplace in a hurry ?
yeah , or go someplace in a hurry .
ex cuse me .
do you want some help ?
no , no , really , i' m fine .
there' s not that much to do .
graham , do you pay taxes ?
yeah , i pay taxes .
yeah , i pay taxes .
what do you mean ?
you don' t pay taxes , you' re a liar .
i' m not a liar .
liars are the second lowest form of human being on the planet .
what' s the first ?
lawyers .
oh .
that' s you , honey .
annie , why don' t you go with graham to hunt for apartments ?
show him how the city' s changed .
would you mind , graham ?
no , i' d love that .
i' d like that , too .
let' s do that .
all right .
how about tomorrow ?
that' d be great .
good .
one key , huh ?
great idea .
yeah .
cynthia , john .
meet me at my house in exactly one hour .
you are scum .
i' il be there .
as you can see , there' s plenty of room for two .
no , it' il just be me .
are you a student ?
no .
you can hang a shower curtain in the bath .
make sure you put somethin ' in the tub so you won' t fall .
you said about 350 ?
yeah .
and , uh , plus the first and the last months ' rent .
all right .
will you lease month to month ?
not for 350 .
how about 400 ?
i could live with that .
i could live with that .
ok .
it' s a deal .
all right .
ready ?
yeah .
john ?
in here .
well , ain' t you a picture ?
well , do you like it ?
it' s lovely .
is it for me ?
yeah , it' s for you .
is that for me ?
yeah , that' s for you .
you' re amazing , dear .
can i tell you something personal ?
it' s up to you .
can i tell you something personal ?
yeah .
yeah .
well , you gotta go first .
ok .
i think that , um ...
i think that sex is overrated .
i think that people place far too much importance on it .
and i think that stuff about women wantin ' it just as bad as men is crap .
i think they want it , i just don' t think they want it for the reason men think they do .
i' m getting confused .
do you understand what i' m ... ?
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah , i remember reading somewhere that men learn to love the person that they' re attracted to , and that women become more and more attracted to the person that they love .
god , that' s ... that' s beautiful .
that' s really beautiful .
i like that .
oh , i' m just quoting .
so , are you gonna tell me something personal ?
do you want me to ?
yeah .
yeah , i do .
i don' t want it to be something gross , about some scar .
i want it to be something really personal , about yourself .
all right .
ok .
i' m impotent .
you' re what ?
lmpotent .
you are ?
yeah .
i mean , like , well , i can' t ...
i can' t get an erection ... in the presence of another person .
so , for all practical purposes , i' m impotent .
does that bother you ?
no .
does it make you feel self conscious ?
not usually .
no .
uh ...
yeah , i' m self conscious .
not in the same way that you are , though .
me ?
me ?
you think i' m self conscious ?
well ...
i been watching you .
i watch you eat , you know , i watch you speak , watch you move , and i see somebody who is extremely aware of people looking at you .
my therapist ...
you' re in therapy ?
aren' t you ?
no .
i ...
no , i' m not .
i was a miserable failure in therapy .
so you don' t believe in therapy ?
no , i believe in it for some people .
i don' t know , it was , you know , silly for me .
i was confused going in .
so i just formed my own theory that you should never take advice from someone that doesn' t know you intimately .
well , i know my therapist intimately .
you' ve had sex with your therapist ?
no !
no .
no .
oh , no , i' m sorry .
that' s what i meant .
somebody you' ve had sex with .
oh .
i' m ...
i don' t understand .
i mean , how would you know ?
i mean , you know .
how ... ?
oh , no .
i wasn' t always impotent .
oh .
oh , ok .
so , let me see .
you said , um ... you said that i should never take advice from someone that i haven' t had sex with , right ?
basically .
right .
and , uh , we haven' t had sex .
right ?
no .
so i guess from your own advice , i shouldn' t take your advice .
i wouldn' t .
you wouldn' t ?
ok .
all right .
drive safely .
yeah , right .
how was your weekend ?
it was ok .
did you confront john about the visitor ?
the visitor ?
the friend of john' s that was staying at your house .
graham .
graham .
yeah .
i mean ... no .
that actually turned out to be interesting .
you know , i was expecting him to be just like john .
you know , cos they went to school together and everything .
you know , talking about getting drunk together and secret handshakes and ...
he turned out to be really this ... character .
he' s kind of arty .
but ok .
is he still at your house ?
no .
no .
no .
he' s gone .
so where' s he from ?
i don' t know .
he , uh , used to live in new york and philadelphia .
i think he just kinda travels around .
must be nice .
so , what' s he like ?
is he like john ?
no .
i don' t think john likes him any more .
says he thinks he' s gotten kinda strange .
is he ?
strange , i mean ?
no .
i mean , if i saw him on the street i might think so , but after talkin ' to him , i' d just say he' s kinda unusual .
mm hm .
so , what' s he look like ?
why ?
i just wanna know , is all .
why , so you can go after him ?
jesus , ann , get a life .
i just asked what he looked like .
besides , even if i decide to fuck his brains out , what business is that of yours ?
why do you have to say that ?
say what ?
you know what .
you say it just to irritate me .
i say it because it' s descriptive .
he doesn' t strike me as a person who would go in for that kinda thing .
ann , you always underestimate me .
i wonder why .
i think you' re afraid to put us in the same room .
you' re afraid he' d be drawn to me .
really , cynthia , i don' t think he' s your type .
my type ?
how would you know what my type is ?
oh , i have a pretty good idea .
ann , you don' t have a clue .
look , i don' t even know why we' re discussin ' this .
i mean , i' il just go over and call him myself .
he doesn' t have a phone .
well , i' il call him when he does .
he won' t .
what are you talkin ' about ?
he doesn' t like to talk on the phone .
he' s not getting a phone .
oh , please .
ok , so give me the zen master' s address .
i' il think of a reason to stop by .
please , just let me talk to him first .
why ?
just gimme the address .
you won' t even have to be involved .
i don' t feel right just giving you the address so you can go over there and ...
and what ?
do whatever it is you do .
do whatever it is you do " ?
listen to the way you talk .
i talk fine .
thank you , i was still smoking that .
what' d you lose ?
that goddamn pearl earring .
it cost me a fucking fortune .
i must' ve left it somewhere .
so , what are you gettin ' momma for her birthday ?
i don' t know .
i' il get her a card or somethin ' .
a card for her 50th birthday ?
yeah , what' s wrong with that ?
well , the woman gave birth to you .
i think you might be givin ' her ...
will you stop ?
jesus .
i just thought that , you know , maybe ...
ok , ann .
ok .
how about this ?
you get her something nice , and i' il pay for half .
all right ?
fine .
fine .
fine .
ok .
now , if you' il pardon me , i have to go to work .
what is the most unusual location you' ve ever masturbated in ?
well ...
i , um ...
one time i was flying from los angeles to , um , to new york .
and i was ...
you know , it was a really crowded flight and i was ...
i was sitting in the middle .
i didn' t get a window , i didn' t get an aisle .
it was really funny , and i was ...
i was just bored .
my magazines were just boring .
i think i had , like , a woman' s magazine .
and they touch on a lot of sexual issues and stuff .
and i was thinking to myself
god , that' s what i need .
i need a little ... something to take my mind off this trip .
so , i was just , you know , just thinking away , and then i just ...
i just did it on the plane .
just between these two people .
nobody knew .
how were you able to not betray what was going on to the people around you ?
well , you know , i have really strong muscles .
it' s open !
hi !
hello , ann .
i hope i' m not botherin ' you .
no , no .
i would' ve phoned .
you busy ?
no , no .
i can finish later .
i just wanted to see what the apartment looked like with furniture .
yeah , well , i' m afraid there' s not much to see .
i' m sort of cultivating this minimalist vibe .
you could use a bookshelf .
yeah ?
yeah , you think so ?
they' re ... you know , they' re all library books .
what are these ?
uh , those are videotapes .
i can see that .
of what ?
it' s a personal project i' ve been workin ' on .
what kind of personal project ?
what ?
what kind of personal project ?
uh , a personal project like anyone else' s personal project .
mine' s just a little more ... personal , i guess .
who' s donna ?
what ?
donna .
it says " donna " here on the tape .
donna was a girl i knew in florida .
oh , you went out with her ?
no , not really .
why do these tapes all have women' s names on ' em ?
well , i enjoy interviewing women more than men .
it' s iced tea .
thanks .
i' m sorry , do you want some lemon ?
no , this is perfect .
so , all of these are ... are interviews , huh ?
uh , yes .
can we watch one ?
no , i' d ...
no .
why not ?
well , i promised each of the subjects that no one would see the videotapes ex cept for me .
what are the interviews about ?
the interviews are about sex .
sex ?
what about sex ?
uh , everything about sex .
like what ?
what they' ve done , what they do , what they want to do but are afraid to ask for , what they wouldn' t do even if asked .
anything i can think of .
oh , your ice .
you just ask them questions ?
yes .
and they answer ' em ?
yeah .
uh ...
mostly .
sometimes they do things .
to you ?
no , uh ... for the camera .
graham , this is just so ...
i' m sorry this came up .
no , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry this came up , and ...
i' m ...
i' m gonna go .
here , i' il take it .
ok .
yeah .
all right .
bye .
he doesn' t want you to come over .
what do you mean ?
did you tell him about me ?
no , i didn' t .
why not ?
look , cynthia , i didn' t have time .
well , why ?
john' s right .
he' s strange and you don' t wanna get involved with him .
what happened over there ?
did he make a pass at you ?
no .
well , what' s this " strange " bullshit all of a sudden ?
is he drownin ' puppies ?
it' s nothin ' like that , ok ?
well , what ?
is he dangerous ?
no .
not physically .
well , what , then ?
i don' t wanna talk about it .
then why did you call me ?
i don' t know .
hello ?
cynthia , john .
not today .
i' ve got other plans .
oh .
well , when , then ?
how about inviting me over to dinner ?
you know what i mean .
yeah , i know what you mean .
it' s open .
hi .
hello .
can i help you ?
i' m cynthia bishop .
do i know you ?
i don' t ...
i' m ann millaney' s sister .
the extrovert .
she must have been in a good mood .
she usually calls me loud .
yeah , she called you that , too .
so , uh , what are you doin ' here ?
you want me to leave ?
no , i just wanna know why you' re here .
well , like i said , ann is my sister .
sisters talk .
you can imagine the rest .
no , i think it' s probably better if i don' t characterise that conversation that i didn' t hear .
i don' t have any idea , really , what you or ann said about me or anything else .
do you want some iced tea ?
sure .
i don' t have any lemons .
the last time i saw ann she left here very confused , i' d say , and upset .
she still is .
so , are you here to make me feel bad for makin ' her feel bad ?
no .
she didn' t tell you why she was upset ?
no .
thanks .
so , i don' t understand what made you wanna come here .
i can' t imagine ann painted a very flattering portrait of me .
yeah , well , see , um , i don' t really listen to ann when it comes to men .
i mean , look at john , for christ' s sake .
but then , you went to school with him , didn' t you ?
you' re probably friends or somethin ' .
no .
no , i think john is a liar .
i think you' re right .
so come on , i came all the way over here to find out what got ann so spooked .
why don' t you tell me what happened ?
spooked " ?
the videotapes are what got ann so spooked .
oh .
i think i get it .
oh , yeah ?
what do you get ?
if ann got freaked out by these , they must be somethin ' sexual .
are these tapes of you havin ' sex with these girls ?
no , not exactly .
either you are or you aren' t .
which is it ?
why don' t you let me tape you ?
doin ' what ?
talking .
about what ?
about sex .
your sexual history , sexual preferences .
what makes you think i' d discuss that ?
nothing .
and you just wanna ask me questions ?
i just wanna ask you questions .
that' s all ?
that' s all .
is this how you get off ?
tapin ' women talkin ' about their sexual experiences ?
yes .
would anyone else see the tape ?
absolutely not .
nobody else sees the tapes ex cept for me .
how long will it take ?
well , that depends on you .
one woman used up only three minutes .
and another used three two hour tapes .
how do we start ?
i turn on the camera and you start talking .
do i sit or stand ?
what do you prefer ?
i' d prefer to sit .
are you ready ?
ok , i' m recording .
so tell me your name .
cynthia ...
patrice ...
bishop .
you can speak in a normal voice .
ok .
so , describe for me your first sexual experience .
um ...
first sexual experience or first time i had intercourse ?
first sexual experience .
sexual experience .
i was ... uh ... eight .
and , uh ...
is this the kinda thing that ... ?
yeah , ok .
i was eight years old , and , um , michael green , who was also eight , asked if he could watch me take a pee .
and i said he could if i could watch him take one , too .
so we went to the woods behind my house .
and i got this feeling he was chickenin ' out cos he kept sayin ' " ladies first !
so i pulled down my little panties and urinated , and he ran away before i even finished .
was it a topic of conversation between you after that ?
no !
he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer , and then his family moved away .
to cleveland , actually .
what a shame .
when did you finally see a penis ?
when i was 14 .
so , what' d you think ?
was it what you expected it to be ?
no .
not really .
i ...
i didn' t ...
i sorta pictured it , um ...
i didn' t think it would have veins or ridges or anything .
i just thought it would be smooth , like a test tube .
it' s weird , thinking about it now .
the ... organ itself seemed like a separate thing , a separate entity to me .
i mean , when he finally pulled it out and i could look at it and touch it ,
i forgot that there was a guy attached to it .
i remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me .
what did he say ?
he said my hand felt good .
then what happened ?
and ...
then i started movin ' my hand , and then he stopped talkin ' .
yeah ?
john , cynthia .
how' d you get through ?
i told janet i was ann .
ah .
she bought it ?
well , obviously .
look ...
i want to see you .
ah .
when ?
right now .
i don' t know if i can do that .
i got a client waiting .
i' ve already rescheduled him once .
i' d have to do some heavy duty juggling .
then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here .
yes , sir ?
janet .
listen , i want you to reschedule kirkland .
i know , i know .
see if he can come in monday , any time .
tell him , uh ...
tell him , uh ...
family crisis .
family crisis .
ok .
i' il slip out the back .
yes , sir .
all right .
bye .
would you like me to take my skirt off ?
if you wish .
you' re not wearing any underwear .
do you like the way i look ?
yes .
do you think i' m pretty ?
yes .
prettier than ann ?
different .
john and ann don' t have sex any more .
is that what he tells you ?
he doesn' t have to tell me .
you' re on fire today .
yes .
you can go now .
what kind of questions ?
questions ... about ... sex .
well , what did he ask , exactly ?
well , i don' t wanna tell you , exactly .
you let a total stranger record your sexual life , but you won' t tell your own sister ?
apparently .
did he ask you to take your clothes off ?
did he ask me to take my clothes off ?
no , he didn' t .
did you take your clothes off ?
yes .
cynthia !
what ?
why did you do that ?
because i wanted to .
but why did you want to ?
because i wanted him to see me .
you' re crazy .
he could be bouncin ' it off some satellite .
some horny old men could be watchin ' .
ann !
he wouldn' t do that .
you don' t know that for sure .
well , it' s too late now , isn' t it ?
did he touch you ?
no .
did you touch him ?
no .
did anybody touch anybody ?
well , yes .
don' t tell me .
don' t tell me .
don' t tell me .
you didn' t .
i did .
you didn' t .
i did !
oh , my god .
cynthia !
you' re in trouble .
listen to you .
you sound like momma .
what are you talkin ' about ?
god , cynthia .
i couldn' t do that in front of john .
you couldn' t do it , period .
i mean , you don' t even know him .
i feel like i do .
you don' t .
you can' t trust him .
he' s perverted .
i don' t understand why this freaks you out so much .
you didn' t do it , i did , and if it doesn' t bother me , why should it bother you ?
i don' t wanna talk about it .
ok , then , don' t .
are ... are you an assassin ?
ex cuse me ?
you' re just an errand boy , sent by the grocer to collect the bill .
it' s my brando .
that' s pretty good , isn' t it ?
marlon brando .
it' s great .
pardon me .
ok .
i was thinkin ' we needed time apart .
maybe you should be there for a while .
hi .
so , why don' t you get an answering machine ?
there' s a phone here .
it' s busy .
well , why don' t you keep tryin ' ?
ok .
well , here it is .
what is it ?
it' s a sundress .
looks like a tablecloth .
it does not .
why would she want a sundress ?
she' s got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins .
well , missy thing , so will you someday .
when i do , i won' t wear sundresses .
god , cynthia ...
hold on .
bayou .
cynthia , john .
would you like to speak with your wife ?
what' s she doin ' there ?
showing me a present she and i are buying your mother in law .
oh .
great .
so , when can i see you ?
i don' t know .
i' m not sure i can duplicate the intensity i had the other day .
nothin ' wrong with trying .
i don' t think my sister would agree .
do you want me to stop calling ?
look , i' il call you .
ok ?
roger .
this is too much .
i' m wearing red , you' re wearing red .
that' s quite a coincidence ...
look , i' m married .
really ?
are you very married ?
married enough .
oh .
oh .
i see .
well , that shouldn' t stop us ...
i' m just here to see my sister .
ok ?
oh , really ?
who' s your sister ?
is she married ?
so , um , what' s my share of the dress ?
32 . 50 .
it' s a nice dress .
thanks .
i thought so , too .
looks like a tablecloth .
keep the change .
and , ann , don' t worry about the dress .
i' m sure she' il like it .
yeah .
i think it' il ...
oh , you have to go ?
ok .
goodbye .
i' il see you later .
i' il call you !
bye .
john ?
mm ?
john ?
i called you last monday at 3 . 30 and they said you weren' t in .
do you remember where you were ?
on monday ?
uh ...
last monday ?
oh , i had a late lunch .
so , who' d you have lunch with ?
i ate by myself .
come on .
is there somethin ' wrong ?
are you havin ' an affair ?
jesus christ !
i have a late lunch by myself and now i' m fuckin ' somebody ?
well , are you ?
no , i' m not .
god , i' m offended at the accusation .
come on .
if i' m right , i wanna know .
i don' t want you to lie .
i' d be upset , but i' d be more upset if you lied to me .
well , there' s nothin ' to know .
i can' t tell you how upset i' il be if you lie to me .
this is paranoia .
i mean ... if anybody should be paranoid , i should be .
here , every time i try to touch you , you act as if i' m dipped in shit .
i think there are a lot of women out there that' d be glad to have a young , straight male makin ' a pretty good living beside ' em in bed with a ... with a hard on .
my sister , for one .
for god' s sake , ann .
is that who it is ?
ann , i' m not fucking your sister .
i don' t find her that attractive , for one thing .
is that supposed to comfort me ?
no , i' m just saying .
i' m just saying i didn' t get paranoid when you didn' t wanna make love to me .
i could have assumed that you didn' t want to because you were having an affair .
i' m not .
well , i' m not either .
now , come on .
then why don' t i believe you ?
oh , look .
this is ridiculous .
maybe when you have evidence ...
there' s evidence ?
that' s not what i' m saying .
i' m just saying that we shouldn' t not ever talk , just don' t give me conjecture and intuition .
always a lawyer .
goddamn right .
i mean , can you imagine ?
your honour , i' m positive the man is guilty .
" i can' t place him at the scene ...
all right .
" but i have this strong feeling ...
all right .
you made your point .
ok .
all right .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m just under a lot of pressure with this ... this kirkland thing .
i mean , you know it' s my first big case as junior partner .
i work all day and i come home .
i look forward to seeing you .
it hurts that you' d accuse me like that .
i' m sorry .
what ?
come on .
i' ve just got all this time on my hands , and i just sit around and start inventing these , like , intricate scenarios .
and then i don' t want to have wasted all my time , so i wanna believe ' em .
isn' t therapy helpin ' at all ?
oh , john , i don' t know .
i just feel so stupid sittin ' talkin ' about my little problems when i know those poor children are starving .
well ...
quitting your therapy' s not gonna ... not gonna feed the children in ethiopia .
i know .
you never used to say the word " fucking " .
fuck .
it' s so stupid , i have a hard time believing you did it .
what' s so stupid about it ?
well , you ...
you don' t even know the guy .
well , you know him .
he' s a friend of yours .
do you think he can be trusted ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
from what you' ve told me , i don' t know .
i shoulda known when he showed up dressed like some undertaker for the art world .
i like the way he dresses .
what if this tape gets into the wrong hands ?
the wrong hands " ?
john , we are not talking about military secrets here .
they' re just tapes he makes so he can sit around and get off .
and he doesn' t have sex with any of them ?
they just talk ?
they just sit around and talk .
i could almost understand it if he had sex with them .
i mean , almost .
why doesn' t he just buy some magazines or some porno movies or somethin ' ?
doesn' t work .
he has to know the people .
he has to be able to interact with them .
interact ?
whatever that means .
did you have to masturbate in front of him ?
i felt like it .
goddamn .
you and ann make such a big deal out of this .
you told ann about this ?
she is my sister .
i tell her almost everything .
i wish you hadn' t .
it' s just something i' d prefer she didn' t have to know about .
she' s a grown up .
she can handle it .
ann ...
ann is just very ...
hung up .
it just wasn' t a smart thing to do .
oh , god !
did you sign any sort of paper , or did he have a contract with you saying that he wouldn' t broadcast these things ?
no , sir .
you realise you have no recourse legally ?
it' s not funny .
it' s not funny , cynthia .
these tapes could show up anywhere .
they won' t .
i trust him .
you trust him ?
that' s funny .
yeah , i do .
a hell of a lot more than i trust you .
what do you mean ?
just what i said .
i' d trust him before i' d trust you .
it hurts that you say that to me .
you' re fucking your wife' s sister .
you' re a liar .
but at least i know that .
i know , i know .
second lowest form of human being .
and the first .
what are you talking about ?
nothing .
you' re lying to ann , too .
yeah , right , but i didn' t take a vow in front of god and everyone to be faithful to ann .
look , are we gonna do it or not ?
actually ... no .
i' ve changed my mind .
i shouldn' t have called .
well , i' m here now .
i need to do somethin ' .
would you like to help me straighten up ?
jesus !
is there one chair in this place that works ?
well , why don' t you go sit somewhere else ?
come on , john .
you should be happy .
we' ve gone this far without ann findin ' out .
i' m makin ' it real easy on you .
just walk out of here .
did he put you up to this ?
who ?
graham .
no , he didn' t put me up to this .
jesus , i don' t need people to tell me what to do .
i' ve just been thinkin ' , that' s all .
now just ... leave .
maybe i don' t wanna leave .
maybe i wanna talk .
john , we don' t have anything to talk about .
yeah , you' re right .
things are gettin ' complicated .
no , they' re gettin ' real simple .
it' s open !
hello .
want something to drink ?
yeah , thanks .
i' m sorry , i don' t have any iced tea left .
thank you .
john and cynthia have been ... fucking .
yes , i know .
you know ?
yes .
how did you know ?
she said it on her tape .
thanks for telling me .
i really appreciate it .
well , i ...
i haven' t seen you .
and i don' t think i would' ve told you even if i had seen you .
why not ?
because it' s not really my place .
my life is shit .
it' s just shit .
nothing' s what i thought it was .
john' s a bastard .
let' s make a videotape .
no , i ...
i don' t think that' s a good idea .
why not ?
because i don' t think it' s a choice that you' d make in a normal frame of mind .
and what would you know about a normal frame of mind ?
that' s a good question .
so , what do you have to do to get ready ?
uh ...
load a tape and turn on the camera .
do it .
so , where do you get your money from , for rent , and tapes , and stuff like that ?
underneath my mattress .
and what are you gonna do when this money runs out ?
it won' t .
are you comfortable there ?
yeah , i' m comfortable .
ok , i' m recording .
tell me your name .
ann bishop millaney .
margaret .
hi , it' s john .
fine .
listen , have you seen ann at all today ?
this afternoon ?
uh ...
well , no , i just ...
she' s home .
bye bye .
everything' s fine .
thanks .
bye .
thank god .
you had me worried sick .
i come home , the door is open , the car is gone .
i thought you' d been abducted by some mad fucker .
are you all right ?
i want out of this marriage .
what ?
i ... want ... out ... of this marriage .
why ?
why ?
you' re asking me why ?
i' m married to you and you want out of this marriage .
i think you could tell me that .
fuck you .
fuck you .
all right .
can you tell me where you went ?
i drove around .
then i went over to graham' s .
graham' s ?
graham .
goddamn that son of a bitch !
the backstabbin ' son of a ...
oh , mr honesty , huh ?
mr apostle of truth !
well , i know you didn' t fuck him .
did you make one of these goddamn videotapes ?
annie ... answer me , goddammit .
goddammit , answer me .
did you ?
yes , i did .
ah !
god !
don' t you touch him !
ok .
i' m gonna ...
what ?
hello ?
john ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
what are you doing ?
ok , i' m recording .
tell me your name .
ann ...
bishop ...
millaney .
so , what do you wanna talk about ?
what do you usually talk about ?
sex .
ok .
let' s talk about sex .
do you have sex ?
not very often , no .
when you do , who usually initiates it ?
he does .
is the sex satisfying ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
i don' t know what you mean .
do you have orgasms ?
i don' t think so .
i mean , i guess , since i' m not sure , that i' ve never had one .
have you ever thought about having sex with someone other than your husband ?
here we go .
here we go .
why don' t we stop ?
no .
i don' t wanna stop .
have you ever thought about having sex with someone other than your husband ?
i' ve thought about it .
did you act on it ?
no .
why not ?
because that' s how cynthia thinks .
i hate it when i have feelings that she has .
it bothers me when i think about men , because i know that' s the way she thinks .
what other men have you thought about ?
i thought about you .
have you thought about me ?
yes .
what did you think ?
i thought about what you would look like having an orgasm .
i' d like to know what i look like havin ' an orgasm .
can you do that ?
give a woman an orgasm ?
yes .
could you do that for me ?
no .
why not ?
because i can' t .
can' t or won' t ?
i can' t because i won' t .
you said you weren' t always impotent .
no .
yeah , that' s correct .
so you have had sex .
yes .
so , what happened ?
was it so bad it turned you off , or ... ?
no , that wasn' t the problem .
what was the problem ?
i was the problem .
i was a ...
i was a pathological liar .
or i am , i should say .
the lying is ...
lying is like alcoholism , you' re continually recovering .
so that' s it ?
you lied ?
that was part of it .
so , what else happened ?
well , at that time , uh ...
i ...
i used to express my feelings nonverbally ,
and often scared people that were close to me .
are you still like that ?
no .
no .
so you' re never gonna make love again ?
i don' t ...
i haven' t made any plans , so ...
if you were in love with me , would you ?
i' m not in love with you .
but if you were ?
i can' t answer that .
why not ?
i told you .
but i don' t understand .
ann , forget about the sex , you know ?
i ...
i' m not the same person that i was ... even remotely , you know .
i' m different in so many ways .
it' d have a profound effect on the way that i relate to other people , communicate .
this , for instance .
the way she and i are talking , it could never have been possible .
she " ?
the way she ... she and i are talking " ?
" she " ?
who' s " she " ?
i' m sorry , i was ...
that isn' t what i was ...
she' s elizabeth ?
is that who it is ?
is that the girl that john talked about ?
is that who it is ?
i guess .
i ...
i' m sorry .
so , you' re still in contact with her ?
with elizabeth ?
no .
i' m ...
what do you think elizabeth is gonna think about all these videotapes ?
i can' t imagine her bein ' too understanding .
but you' re gonna tell her about them , right , since you don' t lie any more ?
as i said , i don' t know what i' m gonna do , exactly .
i mean ... perhaps i won' t do anything .
so , you just came back here so that you could think about it ?
no , i moved back here for some ...
a sense of closure , you know ?
resolution of some sort .
i wanted somebody who was very important to me to understand that .
that' s ...
that' s pathetic .
i mean , you can' t just ...
oh , my god , graham .
you just can' t walk up to her and show her you' ve changed
like it' s some gift or somethin ' .
and look what you' ve changed into .
nine years .
nine years .
and this is what you come up with .
is this what you wanna be the rest of your life ?
why are you doin ' this ?
can you tell me that ?
why are you doin ' this to yourself ?
are you gonna answer me ?
please , don' t do that .
why not ?
don' t do that .
i wanna ask a few questions , like why do you tape women talkin ' about sex ?
why do you do that ?
can you tell me why ?
come on .
i' m just gonna keep askin ' .
i don' t find turning the tables very interesting .
well , i do .
tell me why , graham .
why ?
what ?
what ?
what do you want me to tell you ?
tell me why ? " why ?
ann , you don' t even know who i am .
you don' t have the slightest idea who i am .
am i supposed to recount all the points in my life leading up to this moment and just hope that it' s coherent , that it makes some sort of sense to you ?
it doesn' t make any sense to me .
you know , i was there .
i don' t have the slightest idea who i am , and i' m supposed to be able to explain it to you ?
and why ?
you tell me why .
why do i have to explain myself to you ?
because maybe i can help you .
help me with what ?
your problem .
my problem ?
do i have a problem ?
i look around me in this town and i see john and cynthia and you , and i ...
i feel comparatively healthy .
you' ve got a problem .
you' re right .
i' ve got a lot of problems .
but they belong to me .
you think they' re yours , but they' re not .
everybody that walks in that door becomes part of your problem .
anybody that comes in contact with you .
i didn' t wanna be part of your problem , but i am .
i' m leavin ' my husband , and maybe i would have anyway , but the fact is that i' m doin ' it now .
and part of it' s because of you .
you' ve had an effect on my life .
this isn' t supposed to happen .
i' ve spent nine years structuring my life so that this didn' t happen .
you know , i never told you this , cos i knew it' d crush you .
but now ...
i fucked elizabeth .
before you broke up .
before you were havin ' trouble , even .
she' s no saint .
she was good in bed .
she could keep a secret .
that' s about all i can say about her .
i gotta make a call .
yeah , sure .
kirkland' s office .
john millaney for brian kirkland .
just one moment , please .
all right .
anyway , as i' ve always said , work is critical .
i can be happy without a marriage , but if you take away my work , that' s different .
and if ann can' t handle that ...
well , that' s her problem .
mr millaney ?
yeah .
mr deforest would like to see you .
all right .
in a minute .
i' m on with a client .
he said immediately .
all right .
jesus .
mr millaney ?
yeah ?
mr kirkland asked me to inform you he' s obtained representation elsewhere , and that if you have a message for mr kirkland to leave it with me .
thank you .
um ...
no message .
all right , mr millaney .
thank you .
fool !
hope he knows what he' s doin ' .
mr millaney ?
yeah ?
mr deforest is waiting .
all right .
tell him i' il be in in a minute .
jesus , the old man thinks that the world revolves around a game of golf .
i' il catch up to you at the courts .
i' d better go talk to deforest .
sure .
ok .
fuck .
oh , no , just one' s fine , thanks .
this is my favourite part .
you know , i was thinking we should name our first child rusty .
what do you think of that name ?
ok .
you know , i spend a lot of money in here .
i should at least know your name .
hey .
hey .
i brought you this .
i knew it was your birthday .
thanks .
it' s a nice plant .
looks like a tablecloth .
look , i can' t stay .
i gotta go .
can i call you ?
do you have my work number ?
no .
got a pen ?
ok , now , you' re wearing blue , i' m wearing blue .
is this some sort of weird coincidence ?
i don' t think so .
i think it' s something more .
do you live here ?
no .
i' m just passing through .
look , don' t call between three and five , cos i get real busy , ok ?
ok .
ok .
see ya .
bye .
bye .
i like her .
she' s a very nice girl .
very nice .
hi .
hey .
i think it' s gonna rain .
it is raining .
yeah .
