the devil' s hands are ldle playthings
huh ?
i choose to not understand these signs .
aha !
bender !
i was just not playing the holophonor .
yeah , well , you should try not stinking at it .
well , i am trying .
i' ve been taking lessons .
lessons !
oh , that' s rich !
isn' t it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way ?
i know i should , but i just can' t .
remember those stomach worms i had that made me smart ?
i could play the holophonor .
and it made leela like me .
hey , bender , as long as you know , i have a holophonor recital tuesday . . . . . . and i' d really like to have somebody there .
please ?
fine .
i' il go already .
you know , sometimes i wish your real parents were still alive .
not often , though .
hey !
hello , mrs. mellonger .
hello , philip .
and you must be mr. bender .
philip' s told me so much about you .
is it true that you' re a robot ?
i prefer the term " love machine .
your kid is great .
how hard you say you had to hit him ?
fairly hard .
the grumpy snail .
sorry .
it' s too grumpy !
no !
no !
quit !
stop !
whoo !
mr. bender , i simply cannot teach your child .
then good day , madam !
we hope to see you soon for tea .
it' s hopeless .
i can hear this great music in my head , but my stupid hands can' t keep up .
you know what always cheers me up ?
laughing at other people' s misfortunes !
hey , guys .
you missed a great delivery to space earth .
where you been all afternoon ?
at a concert .
was it jazz noodling ?
my ex boyfriend shawn played the sax .
i used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised .
so musicians really rodger your hammerstein ?
yeah .
it' s weird .
shawn was uneducated , unambitious .
he was pasty and hunched .
pretty boy .
but when he played , i could sense this incredible , beautiful creative soul .
then one day i found someone else' s couch fibers on his butt .
i couldn' t even believe that .
that' s really . . . .
that could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch .
if i could just learn to play this stupid thing .
oh , but you can .
you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil .
and by devil , i mean robot devil .
and by metaphorically , i mean get your coat .
you hit a sour note about 200 years back , doug !
let' s take it from the top .
ow !
bender !
fry !
you' ve come back for more eternal damnation !
no , this isn' t a religious visit .
fry just wants holophonor lessons .
yep .
i need to get really good without practicing .
hell is full of 1 0 year olds who wanted exactly the same thing .
trouble is , you have what my old music teacher . . . . . . mrs. mellonger , calls " stupid fingers .
with hands like that you' il be lucky to master a belt buckle .
now , wouldn' t it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them ?
sure would .
oh , well , goodbye .
fry , you smelly idiot .
i think he' s willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you .
he is ?
great !
wait , what' s the catch ?
no catch .
i' il merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe . . . . . . probably one you' ve never even met , and then i' il remove his hands . . . . . . and switch them for yours .
it' s just the sort of guy i am .
what do you say ?
i don' t know .
it doesn' t seem entirely moral to  fry , if you don' t take this offer . . . . . . i will lose all respect for you and punch you .
well , all right .
you sure i won' t know him ?
definitely probably not .
just sign this contract .
wow .
and here we go !
i got 1 00 bucks on rectal exam bot !
ah !
robot devil ?
i get your hands ?
oh , what an appallingly ironic outcome !
it' s not ironic , it' s just coincidental .
now fork over those ladyfingers , cookie !
i only put my name on there as a show of good faith for the other robots .
stop being such a baby and chop my hands off .
oh , very well .
how' d you do that ?
they' re very good hands .
at last !
at last i have the power to make leela love me !
oh , sorry .
that' il wear off in a couple of days .
check it out , everyone !
i' m back from hell . . . . . . and i' ve got the robot devil' s hands !
neat !
let' s see a trick !
alrighty .
somebody called a robot devil' s here to see somebody called fry .
uh oh .
where' d i go just now ?
hello , fry .
just dropped by to make sure you' re as happy with our little deal as i am .
and oh , give me back my hands !
these things are always touching me in places .
yeah , they get around .
but i' m afraid we had a deal .
looks like i wasted a bus trip .
yes , you did .
yes , now you can hear holophonor virtuoso philip fry ... ... playing 900 of these classic themes in your own home on this two record set .
that' s over 30 minutes of music for only $ 14 . 99 .
only $1 4 . 99 for a two record set .
two records !
oh , zoidberg , at last you' re becoming a crafty consumer .
hello ?
hello ?
i' il take eight !
a mr. hedonism bot to see you .
show him in .
very good , sir .
oh , fry !
congratulations !
your latest performance was as delectable as dipping my bottom . . . . . . over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams .
thank you .
that' s exactly what i was going for .
you are the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season .
and so i would fain commission you write an opera .
but i' ve never written an opera .
and i' ve never heard one .
still , if you can keep me amused through the overture . . . . . . i shall consider it a smashing success .
but i wouldn' t even know what to write about .
unless . . . .
okay , i' il do it .
if i can make it about leela .
me ?
really ?
a man writing an opera about a woman ?
oh , sirrah .
how deliciously absurd .
i shall see you at the premiere .
is it part of the opera ?
leela !
you shouldn' t be listening .
i don' t want you to hear it till it' s done .
but it' s so beautiful .
so is a peacock , but you don' t eat it until it' s cooked .
this has to be perfect .
i want you to hear exactly what i hear when i think about you .
oh , fry .
all this time you' ve had this incredible gift and i never knew .
i' ve been a fool .
a fully justified , prudent fool .
ah !
they' re so cold !
and yet hell is so hot !
can i have my hands ?
no !
you' re not nice !
bender , this is a surprise .
for you , finding me in the refrigerator !
true , but at least i don' t have the hiccups anymore .
what up ?
oh , well , it so happens i' m in the mood to make a deal with you .
forget it , you can' t tempt me .
really ?
there' s nothing you want ?
i forgot you could tempt me with things i want .
i suppose i' ve always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying .
oh .
nothing simpler .
and all i ask in return is your hands to replace these bony hot dogs .
grabby and squeezy ?
never !
i love these guys !
is there anything else you would part with ?
no !
nothing !
ain' t gonna happen .
yes !
with this built in stadium air horn , i can really annoy people !
and all it cost me was my crotch plate .
you certainly are a shrewd businessman , bender .
now find someone and give them a good blast .
yeah !
that' il teach the first person i see a lesson .
my ridiculously circuitous plan is one quarter complete .
well , fry' s opera premieres tomorrow night .
i' m off to find a pair of formal gloves that' il fit over my enormous forearms .
pretty annoying , huh , leela ?
what ?
are you talking ?
oh , god , i' m deaf !
oops !
i' m so , so sorry , leela .
i just wanted to annoy you .
what ?
oh , this is horrible !
i won' t be able to hear fry' s opera .
oh , how delightfully ironic .
it' s not ironic .
it' s just mean .
oh !
out of aerosol .
also ironic .
oh , yeah ?
well , bite my shiny metal
oh , no !
nobody tell fry i' m deaf .
if he found out i couldn' t hear his opera , it' d break his heart .
okay , deafo .
courtesans and gentle fops , i bid you welcome to my opera .
let us cavort like the greeks of old .
you know the ones i mean .
hurrah !
yay , fry !
i watch tv with that guy !
who is this one eyed female baby moses ?
with courage in her female baby smile ?
a savior from the stars or something stranger still ?
orjust a lonely filthy , starving child ?
amy , fry' s looking at me .
what am i supposed to be feeling ?
ah .
leela , leela , leela , save him
save fry , save fry godzilla will devour him
as for me , i must be off to have my doctor check this cough
goodbye
i don' t recall ever fighting godzilla .
but that is so what i would' ve done .
one diet double martini , please .
and for you , sir ?
i' il just have a shirley hemple .
extra !
extra !
world' s greatest opera only half over !
half over ?
oh !
i' d give anything to hear the rest .
anything ?
thank you , sir .
now , as i was saying , anything ?
because i can give you new robotic ears .
what ?
you can give me new ears ?
wait .
what seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return ?
just your hands , my dear .
whatever you said , forget it .
all right , then .
just one hand .
just my left hand ?
please take your seats for act 2 .
i' m not done vomiting !
i can' t stand it !
okay !
you can have my hand .
wonderful !
just sign here .
calculon , old friend , i' m afraid i need your ears .
well , i do owe you for giving me this unholy acting talent !
i can hear !
i can hear like a safecracker !
hey , aren' t you gonna take my hand ?
in good time .
you go enjoy the opera .
to win leela ' s heart with the holophonor' s art
i need hands of transcendental quickness
well , i don ' t see any danger ln gambling with a stranger
for my head is of a most amazing thickness
i' m stupid , i' m stupid i' m stupider than you
i' m stupider than you ln every way
stupider ?
this opera' s as lousy as it is brilliant !
your lyrics lack subtlety .
you can' t just have your characters announce how they feel .
that makes me feel angry !
look , what do you want ?
i want my hands back
never !
a deal' s a deal even with a dirty dealer
very well , then i' il take what i want from leela
whoa !
leela has promised me her hand
fry , you do not understand
i should have revealed i' d been deafened by bender
the shame , the shame
but i feared you' d stop writing this musical splendor
deception ' s the curse of my whimsical gender
he gave me mechanical ears
effective , though just a bit garish
in return , without shedding a tear i agreed that i' d give him my hand
in marriage
huh ?
what ?
you' il give me your hand in marriage
is this really happening orjust being staged ?
it can ' t be real not if leela is engaged
that isn ' t what i meant that isn ' t what i signed
you should have checked the wording in the fine
print
" i' il give you my hand . . . . " in marriage
the use of words expressing something other than their literal intention
now that is irony
i will marry her now and confine her to hell
how droll , how droll
where styx is a river and notjust a band
though they' il play our reception lf all goes as planned
unless , fry , you surrender my hands
destiny has cheated me by forcing me to decide upon
the woman that i idolize or the hands of an automaton
without these hands i can ' t complete the opera that was captivating her
but if i keep them and she marries him
then he probably won ' t want me dating her
bravo !
encore !
i can ' t believe the devil ls so unforgiving
i can ' t believe everybody' s just ad libbing
by the power vested in me by the state of new new york
no !
stop !
take my hands !
you evil , metal dork
surgery in an opera ?
how wonderfully decadent !
and just as i was beginning to lose interest .
jombee , the chocolate icing .
oh .
oh , my , yes .
my hands !
my horrible human hands !
and what did you do to my nails ?
i cleaned them .
now , if you' il excuse me , it' s my poker night and i feel lucky .
so it' s back to hell for me .
come on , nixon !
less reality , more fantasy !
resume the opera !
but i can' t play anymore !
yes , you can !
the beauty was in your heart , not your hands !
the music' s bad and you should feel bad !
ah !
oh !
whoa !
hey !
whoa .
extra !
extra !
greatest opera of all time sucks !
i' il take eight .
please don' t stop playing , fry .
i wanna hear how it ends .
