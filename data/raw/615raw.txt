mathematicians won the war .
mathematicians broke the japanese' s codes and built the atom bomb .
mathematicians ... like you .
the stated goal of the soviets is the global communists .
the medicine or economics .
ln techonology or space .
battlelines are being drawn .
to try on , we need results .
publishable , applicable results .
now who among you would be the next morse ... the einstien .
who among you would be the van gogh of democracy , freedom ...
today we bequeath the americans future into your able hands .
welcome to princeton , gentlemen .
ls not enough that hansen won the conesky scholarship ?
no , he has it all for himself .
this is the first time the carniment prize hasn' t been split .
he has got his sight set on wheeler lab . the new military think that he could done it in mlt .
they are only taking one this year .
hansen used to be pick first .
he is wasted on that .
he should be running for president ...
that could be a mathematic .
i bet your tie is .
thank you .
nelson , symbol creeptography .
nel' s here broke the jap code .
help with the world efficient .
these are what he tells the girls things .
my name is bender , atomic physics .
and you are ...
am i late ?
yes , mr sow .
hi , sow .
richard sow .
ahh ... the burden of genius .
there he is .
so many supplicants in so little time , mr sow
bender ...
congratulations , mr hansen .

my first teacher , she told me i was born with two helping brains but only half of a helping heart .
wow ... she sounds lovely .
but the truth is i don' t like people much .
and they don' t much like me .
but why ?
we are abvious width and charming .
seriously , john .
mathematics ...
mathematics is not going to lead you to higher truth .
and you know why ?
because it is boring .
don' t you believe ?
now have the school boys to all the publish .
i cannot waste time with these classes and these books .
memorize in wicked sums of less immortal .
i need to look through to the governance .
find the truly original idea .
and see the only way i distinguish myself .
it' s the only way i ...
math it .
yes ...
no ...
i hate this thing .
cowards !
all of you !
none of you rise to me much chance .
come on , bender .
who ever wins , sow does his laundry , all semester .
anyone else ?
not at all .
look at him
nash , taking your reverse constitutional ?
i' m hoping to extract them to define their movement .
so cool .
nash , i thought you drive out .
you haven' t got a class or ...
classes will dull your mind
destroy the potential for creative .
oh , i didn' t know that .
nash is going to stun us all with his genius .
it' s just another way of saying doesn' t have the nerve to compete .
are you scared ?
terrify , modify , petrify .
stupidfy by you .
no starch .
press and folded .
may i ask you something , john ?

flatter .
and i' ve got two weapons briefs under secured of you by the d. o. d.
vanish achievements , zero .
i' m a patient person , martin .
when is the next question coming ?
what if you never come up with your original idea , huh ?
lf i were you , i would have chosen the wheeler .
and you are not .
what if you lose ?
you should not have won .
i had the first move on .
my play was perfect .
the hubris are the defeated .
the game is float .
gentlemen , the great john nash .
you' ve been in here for two days .
you know hansen is published for another paper ?
i came for the top of my doctor .
well , on the bright side , you have invented the window art .
this is the group thing touch for all .
this is the plaster of pigeons fighting for bread .
and this here is chasing a man who stole a purse .
john , you watch the marking .
that is weird .
and compare to beavers , some of us are always losers .
my niece , she challege .

hang there .
hey , nash .
nel is trying to get your attention .
oh no ...
go with god .
come back here , man .
unfortune the favours is the braves .
bombs away .
john , you are the mathemathically , successful man ever .
this is going to be the classic .
maybe you want to buy me a drink .
i don' t exactly know what i' m require to say in order to let you happen to course with me .
but could we assume that i was a little ...
i am a bit sensible to talk about photo exchange , right ?
so could we go straight to the sex ?
that would be sweet .
have a nice night , asshole .
i ...
i assume that you like a liitle bit about photo exchange .
that was pretty charming .
walk with me , john .
i' il have a minute to talk with you .
the faculty has completely meet your reviews .
we decide that which application is just a plot .
sir , that would be my first choose , i won' t think a second choice ...
john ... your fellows have attended classes, they are writing in the papers .
oh ...
i am still searching , sir .
the original idea , yeah .
that is very clever , john .
but i suppose that is not enough .
my begging is try to show some promise .
lf you could just arrange another meeting if you be kind off ...
professor einstein , i would be complete if ...
no , john .
i' m willing to show them .
my efficient is ...
john !
john !
do you see what are they doing in there ?
it' s the pens .
reserve for the member of department who make the achievement for the life time .
now what do you see , john ?
well , try seeing an accomplishment .
ls there a difference ?
john , you haven' t focus .
i' m sorry .
but after these point , your record doesn' t won any placement at all .
good day .
i can' t see it ....
jesus christ , john .
i can' t fail .
this is all i have .
come on .
let' s go out .
john ...
john , that' s enough .

damn it , charles .
what is your problem ?
it is not my problem .
and it is not your problem .

that icy fellow is right ...
there is something ... that we can' t weight .
don' t worry .
it is mine .
lncoming , gentlemen .
nash , can you stop answering your papers for 5 seconds ?
i will not buy you gentlemen beer .
we are not here for beer , my friend .
now i feel a bit slow motion .
would she want a large wedding ?
have you remember of nothing ?
we call the lessons of adam smith .
father of modern economics .
ln competition . lndividuals and vision serve the common good .
exactly .
every man for himself , gentlemen .
those who strike out would step with their friends .
i am not going to strike out .
you can lead the blonde water but you can' t make a drink .
no body move .
she is looking over here .
she is looking at nash .
oh , god .
i did' t have the abraham awakes until he opens his mouth .
adam smith needs for pigeon .
what are you talking about ?
for all of you who go for the blonde .
they block each other .
not a single one of us could get her .
so we go to her friends .
but they will all give us a cold shouder , cause no body like to be a second choice .
no one goes to the blonde .
we don' t get each others way .
and we don' t insult the other girls .
and so we' il win .
that' s the only way we all get laid .
adam smith said the best result comes ... from everyone in the group doing what is best for himself .
right ? ls that what he said ?
lncompleted ...
because the best result would come ... of every one in the group doing what is best for himself ... and the group .
nash , this is some way that you get the blonde on your own .
you can go to hell .
adam smith is wrong .
here we go ...
becareful ...
thank you .
you do realize that this flies over the face of economics over 1 50 years ?
yes .
i do , sir .
that is rather presumptuous , don' t you think ?
yes , sir .
well , mr nash , with the breakthrough of this magnitude ,
i' m confident that you can get any placement that you like .
wheeler' s lab will ask you to recommend two team members .
still in fact got excellent choices .
sow and bender , sir .
sow and bender ...
extraordinary mathematicians .
sow and bender , they might have the plans of their own .
you have made it .
odd moment , gentlemen .
governing dynamics ..
congratulations , john ...
general , athletics won' t allow us in here .
dr nash , your coat .
thank you , sir .
doctor .
general , this is the wheeler teamleader , dr john nash .
i' m glad you could come , doctor .
hello .
right this way .
we' ve been inaccepting radio transmission from moscow .
computer can' t detect the pattern but i' m sure it is code .
have you just know something , dr nash ?
constantly .
we develop several safers , if you like to review our preliminary data .
doctor ?
8494 ...
i need a map .

what about the russian' s move , general ?
captain roger will restore you to a unrestricted area , doctor .
thank you .
dr nash , follow me please .
a moment in the pentagon , huh ?
they usually take the word " classified " out of the dictionary .
the air condition broke again .
how am i going to safe the world if i am melt ?
you know , two trip to the pentagon in 4 years .
it gets better , john .
sign here since it is relating to the assignment .
you know , the russian has the aged bomb .
and nasa is repaying south america .
chinese has outstanding army of 2 . 8 million .
i am doing stress test on a damn .
hey , look .
you make the cover of the fortune again .
please do not use the word " you " , not " we " .
that was supposed to be just me .
so not only they rob me in the field , now they put me on the fortune' s magazine with these hats , the scholars of tribia .
what' s the difference between genius and most genius ?
quite a lot .
his your son .
you got 1 0 minutes .
i always got 1 0 minutes .
before a new class .
can i not getting a " no " for a doctor or something ?
you are a doctor , john .
and no .
never mind .
you are the drill and we give beautiful facilities .
mlt got a lot of great answers for tomorrow .
have a nice day at school .
you' il get young minds tomorrow .
can we open one , professor ?
it' s really hot , sir .
your comfort comes to my second ability to get mourn .
personally , i think this class would be a waste of yours , and what is infinitely worse my time .
however , here we are , so ...
you may attend or not , you may complete your assignment , we have to go .
miss !
excuse me !
hi !
we have a little problem .
it' s extremely hot with the window close , and extremely noisy with them open .
so i was wondering if there is anyway you could maybe work some place else for about 45 minutes .
no problem .
thank you so much .
as you will find they will be multiply severals calculative up , and a number of solutions to get in problem .
as i was saying , this problem have will take some of you many months to solve .
and the others among you , take you to determine in the natural lifes .
professor nash .
william patcher .
big brother ... of natural service .
what can i do for the department of defense ?
are you getting me raise ?
let' s take a walk .
lmpressive work at the pentagon .
yes , it was .
i used to see genius see the answer before the question .
this project was under my supervision .
which project ?
that project .
it' s not that simple , you know .
were you under the war ?
we incinerate it .
1 50, 000 in a heart beat .
great dids come with great cost , mr patcher .
conviction turn out as the luxuries for those in the sideline
i' il try keep that in mind .
so , john .
no family , no close friends .
why is that ?
i like to think because i' m alone wolf .
but mainly is because people don' t like me .
well , there are certain reason that you' re lack of connection with people would be consider as an advantange .
this is secured .
they know me .
do you ever been here ?
i was told this warehouse is abandoned .
that' s not precisely accurate .
lf i' m telling you what i' m about to tell you ,
i' m increasing your clearance to top secret .
disclose your up secured information result an imprisonment .
you get it ?
part of operation .
that' s a good idea .
this factory is in berlin .
we ceased it at the end of the war .
nasty engineers were intended to build portable atomic bomb .
the soviets reached this facility before we didn' t .
we lost the damn thing .
they are running orders in the pentagon .
they are about this , aren' t they ?
the soviets are unify as people believe .
the new freedom has controlled the bomb and intense to dead netted in the u. s. soil .
their plan is to increase maximum casualties .
it has much capable than imagination .
new freedom has slippery agents here in the u. s.
mcculty isn' t an idiot .
unfortunately that doesn' t make him wrong .
new freedom communicates to it' s agents send codes to the newspapers and magazine .
that' s why you come in .
you see , john ...
what distinguish you ?
ls that you are quite simply the best code breaker i ever seen .
what exactly is it that you would like me to do ?
commit these articles to memory .
scan each new issue , find the hidden code and decide for them .
you will feel a bit uncomfortable .
that' s got a little zap to it isn' t it ?
you just implant the radium .
don' t worry .
it is safe .
the isotope decays predictably .
as a result , these numbers change over time .
they are the access code to your jobs .
so what am i now ?
a little spy ?
it must be really important .
it' s alright , mike .
what are you working on ?
classified .
everyone waited half an hour .
for ?
class .
you miss class today .
well , i suspected ... nobody miss me .
the problem that you left on the board ...
i solve it .
oh no , you didn' t .
you don' t even look .
i never said that the rest in the field are rational functions .
the solution is elegant .
go on with this particular occasion .
all of them are correct .
you' re still here .
i' m still here .
i' m wondering , professor nash ...
lf i can ask you for dinner .
you do eat , don' t you ?
occasionally ... yeah .

so ... you can see that the zero ... of the imams isn' t functioning .
the singularies in space times ... singularies in space times then ...
and conventional numberic book ... it breaks down ... the face of realistic exploration .
sometimes our expectations are betray by the numbers . unbearable and impossible to sign any ...
rasional ... in value ...
professor nash !
hold it !
professor nash !
professor nash ?
let' s avoid the scene , shall we ?
what do you want ?
my name is rosen .
