we' ve got 1 9 minutes to get a message in if we can break this .
the tattler can' t hold its presses any longer .
it' s something simple .
they only needed cover against casual readers .
i' m thinking it' s a book code .
book code ? .
the first numeral 1 00 prayers could be the page number .
the paired numbers after that could be line and letter .
but what book ? .
not the bible ? .
he' s got galatians 1 5 : . 2 .
galatians only has six chapters .
same with jonah 6 : . 8 .
jonah has four chapters .
he wasn' t using a bible .
then the tooth fairy named the book to use .
he specified it in his note in the part lecter tore out .
it would appear so .
what about sweating lecter ?
in a mental hospital , i would think drugs no .
they tried sodium amytal on him three years ago ... trying to find out where he buried a princeton student .
he gave ' em a recipe for dip .
besides , if we sweat him , we lose the connection .
if the tooth fairy picked the book , then it' s something he knew lecter would have .
can we get a list of his books ? .
from chilton , maybe .
no , wait .
rankin and willingham , when they tossed his cell ... took polaroids so they could put everything back in place .
ask them to meet me with pictures of his bookshelves .
where ? .
the librart .
will , i' m leery of letting lecter' s message run without knowing what it says .
i say let this one run .
we keep working on the code .
at least it' il encourage the tooth fairy to contact him again .
what if it encourages him to do something besides write ? .
i don' t like this any better than you , but it' s our best shot .
oh , my god .
hello .
jack , it' s lloyd bowman .
i solved the code .
you need to know what it says right now .
okay , lloyd .
it says , " graham home , marathon , florida .
save yourself .
kill them all .
yeah ? .
bowman just broke the code .
what does it say ? .
i' il tell you in a second .
listen .
everything is okay .
i' ve taken care of it , so stay on the phone when i tell you .
tell me now .
lecter gave the bastard your home address .
wait , wait .
will ? .
will !
mom ? .
is he after you now ?
no , no .
lecter just suggested it to him .
i hate this .
molly , i ' m i ' m sorry .
it' s a sick feeling .
i know it is .
but you' il be safe here .
crawford' s brother owns this place .
no one in the world knows you' re here .
i' d just as soon not talk about crawford .
beneath the yellow folder you' il find your latest rejection slip from the archives .
it was brought to me by mistake with some of my archives mail .
i' m afraid i opened it without looking .
sorry .
i think we' il remove dr. lecter' s toilet seat as well .
atlanta p. d. nailed him .
he had a fake bureau i. d .... and was trying to get the leeds family autopsy photos .
it' s a federal beef , so atlanta kicked him back to us .
i' d like nothing better than to see this dirt sandwich pulling five at leavenworth .
but maybe there' s a better way to handle this .
yeah , what' s that ? .
i think we ought to give him a story .
the tooth fairt' s ugly and he' s impotent with members ofthe opposite sex .
mm hmm .
also , he , uh , sexually molests his male victims .
while they' re alive ? .
sorrt .
i can' t go into those details .
but we do also speculate that he' s the product of an incestuous home .
mm hmm .
no wonder the creep' s such a loser , right ? .
that' s a tip we got from dr. lecter , by the way .
so it' s true lecter' s actually helping with your investigation .
yes , it' s true .
the doctor was offended that a bottom feeding lowlife ...
like the tooth fairy would consider himself in the same league .
okay .
uh
tell me about this place you got here , will your little washington hideaway .
this is just an apartment i' m borrowing till this creep goes down in flames .
i keep copies of all the evidence here so that i can work on it late at night .
make sure you can read the name on that building .
yeah .
i got enough .
just remember .
i scratch your back , you scratch mine .
and if my story draws the fairy into any kind ofattack on graham ... and you nail the scumbag , i get an exclusive .
fuck you , lounds .
when we see the story in print , then we' il consider what to do about your sealed indictment .
yeah , yeah .
it' s a pleasure doing business with you .
chumps .
i feel like i need a shower .
you okay with this ? .
better he comes after me than molly and josh .
so , yeah , i' m okay with it .
i wish we had something better , but there' s only ten days till the next full moon .
we' ve gotta rattle his cage .
we' il stake out this apartment , put snipers on the nearby rooftops .
also , you' il have a moving box tail 24/ 7 in your car , on the street , wherever you go .
you' il wear the kevlar at all times , no exceptions .
you again ? .
come back at 4 : 00 a . m . when i open , all right ? .
hey !
hey , i told you
what ? .
you told me what ? .
fucking dick .
is that your fucking name on the sign ? .
ow .
where am i ? .
what am i doing here ? .
atoning , mr. lounds .
i haven' t seen your face .
i couldn' t possibly identify you .
i work for the national tattler .
it would , uh , pay a big , uh , reward a big reward for me .
i mean , a half a million
a million , maybe .
do you know who i am , mr. lounds ?
no .
and i don' t wanna know .
you know , believe me .
according to you ,
i' m a vicious , perverted sexual failure .
a bottom feeding lowlife who' s about to go down in flames .
i think you know now , don' t you ?
yes .
do you understand what i' m doing , mr. lounds ?
no .
but i i would i' d like to .
i really want to ... understand .
and then all my readers could understand too .
i am not a man .
i began as one , but each being that i change ... makes me more than a man , as you will witness .
i don' t need to see you .
no .
oh , but you must , mr. lounds .
you' re a reporter .
you' re here to report .
open your eyes and look at me .
no .
if you don' t open them yourself , i' il staple your eyelids toyour forehead .
i don' t want to .
open your eyes !
oh , my dear god .
jesus .
oh , god .
do you want to know what i am ? .
more than anything .
i was afraid to ask .
do you see now ?
yeah , i see .
oh , god .
mrs. jacobi in human form .
do you see ? .
yes .
mrs. leeds in human form .
do you see ?
yes .
mrs. jacobi changing .
oh , my god .
do you see ? .
mrs. leeds changing .
do you see ? .
mrs. jacobi reborn .
do you see ?
mrs. leeds reborn .
do you see ? .
please , no .
no ? .
no what ? .
not me .
god , not me .
why did you write lies , mr. lounds ? .
graham told me to lie .
graham .
it wasn' t me .
will you tell the truth now ? .
yes .
about me ? .
mywork ? .
oh , yes , yes .
my becoming ? .
yeah .
ya yeah .
i am the dragon , and you call me insane .
you are privy to a great becoming ... but you recognize nothing .
no .
you are an ant in the afterbirth .
it is in your nature to do one thing correctly .
before me you rightly tremble .
but fear is not what you owe me , mr. lounds .
you owe me awe .
read .
that' s all , mr. lounds .
you did vert well .
you' il let me go now ? .
soon .
there is one more way i can help you to better understand .
i i i wanna understand .
i do .
and i ' m really gonna be fair ... from now on .
you know that .
hello ? .
i have hada great privilege .
i have seen with wonder and awe ... the strength of the great red dragon .
he has helped me to understand his splendor .
and now i want to serve him .
he knows you made me lie , will graham .
because i was forced to lie , he will be more merciful to me ... than to you .
hello ? .
oh , god !
we can let this tie us up in knots ... or we can learn from it .
maybe even use it to catch the bastard .
he had to have a van or panel truck to move lounds around in that big old wheelchair .
mm hmm .
go on .
anybody .
he had to already have the wheelchair , too , or know where to get one fast .
it' s an antique , not the kind of thing you find around the house .
does it strike anybody that he set this up in one hell of a hurry ? .
the tattler comes off the press monday night .
bytuesday morning he' s in chicago snatching lounds .
he either lives in the chicago area or he' s within a driving radius ... of ... call it six hours .
find out within this area where the tattler was available for early distribution .
start with the airports and all night newsstands .
maybe some newsy remembers an odd customer .
lloyd , this cassette enhance the audio .
maybe you could pick up something in the background .
beverly , jimmy , that wheelchair
i want the maker , date , possible sources .
graham and i will coordinate from chicago .
let' s hustle .
look , there' s not gonna be any answers in chicago , jack .
okay , i mean , lounds that was a bonus .
that was just a chance to show off .
it doesn' t even fit his pattern .
the leeds and the jacobis are what he needs .
i think i should go back to baltimore .
after what he tried to pull ? .
i think lecter picked up on something in the missing part ofthat note .
maybe not a name , but something .
enough to narrow the search .
he won' t tell you .
not unless i can offer him something .
congratulations , will .
that was most artistic of the way you disposed of the annoying mr. lounds .
your cell looks bigger with no books in it .
does it ? .
i hadn' t noticed .
well, you will .
i have other resources .
tell me , will .
did you enjoy it ? .
your first murder ? .
of course you did .
and why shouldn' t it feel good ?
it does to god .
only last week in texas , he dropped a church roof on the heads of 34 of his worshippers , just as they were groveling for him .
he wouldn' t begrudge you one journalist .
put me next to him , doctor .
you and some swa t team ?
oh , will , where' s the fun in that ? .
he' il have to take his chances too .
a roof can fall on anybody .
but not on molly and josh , i take it .
not yet anyway .
first he kills the pet , then the family .
freddy was your pet .
they' re safe now .
no one will ever be safe around you , will .
clever work on his note , by the way .
and that blackout was an especially nice touch .
what else was in that note , doctor ? .
put me next to him .
that' s what you want , isn' t it ? .
to help him succeed where you failed ... twice .
give him a chance to kill me .
go on then .
seduce me with your wares .
full restoration of your privileges , plus computer access to the a. m. a. archives one hour a week , under supervision of course .
but this is a one time offer .
it expires the minute i walk out ofhere .
a bit measly , don' t you think ? .
turn it down then .
see what kind of terms you get from chilton .
ooh .
are these threats , william ? .
i' m waiting , doctor .
or maybe you' ve got nothing left to sell .
a little sample then .
why not ? .
seen the blake , have you ? .
yes .
no , you' ve looked but not seen .
transformation is the key .
the man/ dragon his ugliness transformed by power .
look for a militartrecord with combat training .
look for extensive tattooing ... and corrective surgery , most likely to the face .
come on .
i' m past all that already , and you know it .
now give me what i need .
how is he choosing the women ? .
i' ve already suggested how .
the answer was right in front ofyou .
you looked but didn' t see .
bullshit !
no riddles .
just tell me .
no .
it' s your turn .
i asked you before for a small courtesy , and you responded rudely .
before i tell you anything more , you will make certain arrangements for me .
what kind of arrangements ? .
oh , nothing much .
shall we say dinner and a show ? .
you ready to tell me what kind of outing this is ? .
nope .
you' re just full of surprises , aren' t you , d. ? .
yep .
he' s about six feet away .
can you smell him ? .
yeah .
now , he' s a little noisy , but he' s sedated .
i assure you .
dr. hassler' s about to fix his broken tooth .
glad you could come .
we appreciate the infrared film , by the way .
two more steps .
i ' il put your left hand on the edge of the table .
okay , he' s right in front of you .
take your time .
d. ? .
i' m here .
you go ahead .
here .
why don' t you try this ? .
nine steps from the front door to the clock and three more to this room .
sorry .
force of habit .
## [ mellow swing ]
that beautiful tiger , this house , this music
i don' t think anybody knows you at all , d.
everybody wonders about you though .
especially the women .
what do they want to know ? .
they find you ... very mysterious ... and interesting .
did they tell you how i look ? .
they said that you have a remarkable body .
that you' re very sensitive about your face but you shouldn' t be .
oh , and , uh [ chuckles ]
they asked me if ... you are as strong as you look .
and ? .
i said i didn' t know .

no .
i want you to be here .

it' s just a tape i need to watch .
won' t take long .
do you need to hear it too ? .
no .
may i keep the music ? .
uh huh .
what' s it about ? .
some people i' m going to meet .
so then , it' s what ? .
it' s a corporate promo ? .
some kind of homework ? .
homework .
yeah .
it' s a good idea .
it' s so important to be prepared .
oh , my god .
are you ever .
no .
no , i won' t give her to you .
no .

no !
you' re hurting me !
no , she' s

good huntin ' .
byron metcalf .
## [ classical ]
mm m .
will , how many more times are we going to watch this ?
see them i iving , " he said . " right in front ofyou .
it' s something about these home movies .
lecter keeps saying , " you looked but didn' t see .
lecter says a lot of things .
it' s a sad damn thing , but we already knew that .
will , we can' t afford to let lecter waste
no , no .
again .
your dissertation must be nearly finished by now , mr. crane .
nearly .
it' s so nice to finally be able ... to connect a face with a name after all our correspondence .
but you know , you don' t look at all like i imagined you would .
what did you think i' d look like ? .
different .
## [ continues ]
right there .
there .
right there .
that' s what he wanted the bolt cutter for .
to cut that padlock and go in through the basement .
but that' s a different door .
i don' t get it .
the one i saw was flush steel with dead bolts .
jacobi had a new door installed .
beginning of january , i think .
it' s in here somewhere .
you think he cased the house while the old door was there ?
he brought the bolt cutter , didn' t he ? .
he was sure he' d need it .
why case it almost two months in advance , then not check it again ? .
i don' t know , but he was ready with the bolt cutter , just like at the leeds house , only there he was ready with the glass cutter .
he must have seen the glass pane in the leedses ' kitchen door ... when he was walking through the neighborhood .
no , you can' t see that door from the yard .
there' s a porch lattice in the way .
jack , he knew the inside ofthe houses .
remarkable , isn' t it ? .
two hundred years old .
and yet so fresh , so vivid .
he almost looks alive , doesn' t he ? .
we just had a report here from
mr. metcalf , do you have the jacobis ' check stubs and credit card statements ?
we' re looking for any kind of service call or purchase ... that might have required a stranger to come into the house a repairman or a delivery guy .
yeah .
i know we already checked that , but now we' ve gotta go back much further .
all the way to before januart .
yeah .
no collar .
no collar .
please hurrt .
it' s urgent .
metcalf says  no collar .
the dog had no collar ... in a neighborhood full of dogs , but he knew which one was their' s .
same with the jacobis ' cat .
no collar , but he knew .
he knew about the padlock .
he knew about the pane of glass .
he knew the layout .
he knew how to get in .
every goddamn thing he needed to know was on this
oh , j esus .
is metcalf still on the phone ? .
give me .
byron , it' s graham .
hi .
you said niles jacobi took a few keepsakes .
do you have a list ? .
yeah , right here .
i need to know if one of the things he tookwas a home video .
a full length v. h. s. tape compiled from shorter tapes .
one videotape .
yes ? .
it says , " meet the jacobis .
it' s chromalux .
we just got a fax .
an incident at the brooklyn museum .
guy attacked two employees , and get this ate the blake painting .
what ? .
that' s him .
it' s gotta be .
if that painting meant so much to him , why destroy it ? .
and why didn' t he kill those two women at the museum ?
they both got a good look at him .
maybe he' s trying to stop .
mr. crawford , all you' ve got' s a hunch .
i' ve got 382 employees , and they' ve got a union .
i can' t just turn you guys loose in their files , not without a court order .
there are privacy issues here , the company' s exposure
one of those employees has already killed 1 1 people that we know of .
if he gets away tonight , what' s the company' s exposure on that ? .
let me get our lawyers .
you guys can work something out .
we don' t have time for that .
listen to me .
we' re looking for a white male , 25 to 35 .
he' s right handed .
he has brown hair .
listen , please .
this guy' s very strong .
he' s possibly a bodybuilder .
he might have some kind official disfigurement .
he drives a van or a panel truck .
that sounds like mr. d.
oh , my god .
who' s mr. d. ? .
that' s francis dolarhyde .
he' s our manager oftechnical services .
what does he do exactly ? .
he maintains the equipment for tape transfers .
would he have access to people' s home videotapes ? .
he has access to every tape that comes through here .
thanks for dinner , ralph , and thanks for letting me vent .
hey , look , no " problemo .
reba , listen .
i know it' s not my place to say this .
go on .
well , if dolarhyde is really as moody as you say he is , maybe you ought to keep a little distance .
i mean , what do you really know about the guy ? .
i appreciate your concern , ralph , really .
and i promise i' il give it some thought .
hey , have a great vacation .
thanks .
see you in a week .
good night .

i wanted to trust you .
you felt so good .
so did you , d.
please don' t hurt me now .
it' s all over for me .
where are you , d. ? .
i can' t leave you to him .
do you know what he' il do ? .
he' il fight you to death .
he' il hurt you so bad .
i can' t let that happen .

will , you all right ?
all right , that' s all i need .
but ifit' s all right , i' d like to come back again before i leave to see how you' re doing .
sure .
why not ? .
who could resist a charmer like me ? .
you know , whatever part of him was still human ... was only kept alive because of you .
you probably saved some lives .
you didn' t draw a freak , okay ? .
you drew a man with a freak on his back .
i should have known .
oh , no , sometimes you don' t .
trust me .
i i' ve been there myself .
listen to me .
there was plenty wrong with dolarhyde , but there' s nothing wrong with you , except your hair .
your hair is a train wreck .
can we please do something about that for next time maybe ? .
please ? .
that would be nice .
thank you .
just get some rest .
you' re gonna be fine .
we found this in his safe .
thought you might wanna take the first look .
you' ve earned it .
yeah .
when i read his journal , it was sad .
it was just so sad .
i couldn' t help feeling sorry for him .
he wasn' t ... born a monster .
this guy was made one through years and years of abuse .
hey .
hey , dad .
can we make s' mores ? .
some mores ? .
yeah , s' mores .
yeah .
yeah , you' re on .

then whose are they ? .
st. louis p. d. is looking for a chromalux employee named ralph mandy .
he was supposed to be on vacation , so nobody missed him for a week .

wait for the beep .

mommy .
mommy .
my dear will
you must be healed by now , on the outside at least .
i hope you' re not too ugly .
what a collection of scars you have .
never forget who gave you the best of them , and be grateful .
our scars have the power to remind us that the past was real .
we live in a primitive time , don ' t we , will ?
neither savage nor wise .
half measures are the curse of it .
any rational society would either kill me or put me to some use .
do you dream much , will ?
i think of you often .
your old friend , hannibal lecter .
hannibal , there ' s someone here to see you .
wants to ask you a few questions .
i said you' d probably refuse .
a young woman .
says she' s from the f. b. i.
though she' s far too pretty if you ask me .
i' il tell her you said no .
what is her name ? .
