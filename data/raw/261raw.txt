you' re welcome to stay .
i live alone .
don' t get any ideas .
i don' t even think about it .
is it too strong ?
no , it' s just as it should be .
i can' t think that our town is doomed .
ginjo and oggi are fine together .
they do what they want with us .
really ?
you have such punks ?
they terrify the farmers . and the town people .
they demand money for protection every day .
if it keeps going like this ... ... the more we work , the poorer we get .
you pay for protection each day ?
we didnt use to .
we were paying each month .
big difference .
each month , each day .
exactly .
are you alright ;
we' il stay here for a while .
i will work again as a bodyguard .
don' t you worry about me .
don' t do that job for me .
one day i' il become a clerk again .
stop worrying .
you need some rest .
eh , old man !
where is grandfather ;
he' s sick today .
he won' t come .
you make him work too much .
i' m sorry .
you must take care of him more .
sake is awful , as always .
can' t get any better .
same old story for 10 years !

can' t you take the by yourself ?
drink at the bench !
w w welcome .

shut up !
what do you want ?
send a message to your boss .
capable ronln looks for bodyguard job .

samurai , you' re the one that seeks for a master to protect ?
as a bodyguard ?
show me what you can do .
well ..

look at your leg .
masseur , i' m off to the fields .
tell me, lady ...
can i do something to help ?
thank you for offering your help ... ... but i cannot ask from a blind man to cut the woods .
don' t you care about it .
you get some rest .
my dear ...
you came back late last night .
anything happened ?
i found a good job .
as a bodyguard again ?
i beg you , don' t do it for me .
i beg you , stop doing this kind of jobs .
don' t be a fool .
with the money you may get well .

we have 2 problems to solve .
we must clean ijutsu and funahatsi .
after that the town will be yours , boss .
try not to be very hard .
yes .
don' t you worry .

do you have any news on the heihatsi murder ?

it is said that he was killed by a geisa .
that' s what we know for now .
a bit more , masseur ?
no , thank you .
i' ve had enough .
thanks again .
my lady , while i was cutting woods ... ... someone was running round the house .
what was he ?
neighbour' s son .

he imagines that he' s a samurai .
he runs like that all day .
samurai !
so ...
i' il be out for a while .
for work ?
not exactly .
for this .
what ?
you gamble ?
better stay away from that .
my nephew is addicted to gambling .
he refuses to work , he gambles all day .
what can i say ...
he' s lost from the face of the earth .
for me , it' s a pleasure .
some pleasures can be very dangerous .
what do u think ?
this sword cost me a fortune .
yes , mr. oggi , a wonderful sword .
i will give it back to lord sakai .
he will be very please to do work with us .
sure .
i' d say that you test it on the first beggar that comes by .

yes , you !
thanx you , master , but you better do it .
no way !
i' m not makin my kimono dirty !

i must kill you to regain my honur .
grab your sword !
kill me if you want .

it was unbelievable .

if we stay here , they' il find us shortly .
lets go to my aunt' s .

your nephew , sinkitsi .
he probaly lost everything again .
come in .
who are these guys ?
watch out , masseur . masseur !

you are useless !
what happened to the bodyguard ?
everything was over when he came .
the masseur was already gone .
who' s that masseur ?
don' t really know .
a masseur .
that punk , sinkitsi , was with him .
he often goes the club .
it wouldn' t be hard to track him .
we' il get the masseur too .
firstly we must make the funahatsi gang extinct .
don' t you say ...
we were suddenly going from town to town .
cheating men and robbing them .
ten years ?
these punks must live differently now .
hold on .
wasn' t oggi here ten years ago ?
right .
indeed , that oggi ...
something' s not right about him .
i saw his arm .
he has a snake tattoo .
one moment ...
the names u just told ...
you mentioned someone named kutsinawa ?
yes , right .
kutsinawa means " rotten rope " .
maybe it means snake .
right ;
masseur !
don' t look at me with these eyes !
i' ve heard about last night .
a masseur ruined your store .
yes .
we runned with the bodyguard .
but we were late .
oggi ...
who were those ladies ?
lord sakai tried to take one .
but the other one hit me hard .
the way i saw them acting ... ... i am sure they are not real geisas .
listen ...

we' re playing .
even .
odd .
i won .

grandfather , where is the old man today ?
he had something to take care of .
that dull man ?
why you' re working in this dump ?
don' t you have any family ?
exactly .
he picked me from the streets and offered my a job .
i was treated good .
i' m thankful for what he has done for me .
it' s better begging than working in here !

5 plus 1 , even .

it' s over .
that masseur ...
do u think he' s zatoichi ?
and that geisas ... .. must be from the naruto family .
naruto' s taking down ...
when did this happen ?
ten years ago .
i see .
if the kids survive , they must be grownups now .
i wonder ...
that bodyguard ... ... is he capable of winning versus zatoichi ?
where is oggi ?
boss ginjo himself !
i' m glad you came !
this way please .
i' ve heard your business goes well .
i told you not to come here . don' t worry .
funahatsis are past .
we' re in charge now .
the only thing left is to fill our pockets .
clean up in here !
great news !
funahatsi gang is extincted .
ginjo gang and the bodyguard slaughtered them all .
that ginjo guy pays for that tremendous bodyguard !
masseur , you better don' t go to the town .
sinkitsi , that bodyguard is really so strong ?
he' s unbelievable .
if we had to face each other at night , who would be the winner ?
if it was so dark , noone would see a thing .
the winner would be probably you .
you think it' s funny ?
let' s see you now .
i' il train you .
come !
i' il teach you the art of battle .
concentrate .
we start .
attack from all sides .
not all at the same time !
let' s try again .
for safety , let' s plan the moves .
listen to me .

you hit here .
then ... ... you !
and then , you .
good .
let' s try .

masseur ...
i' m thinkin of paying a visit to oggi , again .
i have to know if he was one of the thiefs .
water is cold .
boil it better !
don' t get on my nervers !
ain' t it too much already you bathing yourself at daylight !
you' re useless !
it isnt good cold .
please , boil it a bit more .
that' s what i' m doing !
i confess it' s unbelievable .
you really look like a woman .
make up makes men more beautiful ?
not all .
depends on the face .
welcome .
we wanna ask sorry from mr. oggi .
he paid us to dance for him and we treated him disrespectful .
really ?
can you tell him we said sorry ?
sit down .
oggi drinks too much .
he probably has already forgotten abou it .
don' t you worry .
i hope you' re right .
we haven' t seen you lately .
where do you live ?
at ms. ume' s house .
is there a masseur living with you ?
are you alright , grandfather ?
throw ' em out .
drink something .
thank you .
oggi and ginjo are friends now .
they are preparing something .
but their job has nothing to do with you .
one more ?
not yet .
i' m off to oggi' s .
i' il be late .
you wait here .
oggi says he' s not angry at all .
he likes you and wants to see you both .
thank you very much .
thank you for the sake .
good luck .
where are the others ?
they' re off to the city .
what are you doing over there ?
are you mad ?
i wanna be beautiful , like osei .
what are you craving for !
what' s all this fuss ?
you' re back , silly kid ?
where is the masseur ?
who are you ?
we want the masseur .
he' s not here .
you cannot hide him from us .
but he' s not here .
we' il burn down the house and he will appear .
burn it !
stop !
aunt ume !
we' re in trouble !
the house is on fire !
wake up !
we' re in trouble !
come on !
quickly !
who are these people ?
sinkitsi !
damn !
very beautiful woman .
woman ?
things are not always what they seem too be , inosouke .
don' t use that old name .
the walls have ears here .
my name is ginjo now .
what are you looking at ?
keep dancing .
we know it all .
you' re naruto' s kids .
masseur !
girls , go now .
call the bodyguard .
inosouke , where are you heading at ?
where is the bodyguard ?
at his home .
call him now !
give me the sword !
on top of mama turtle goes the baby turtle .
on top of baby turtle goes the baby baby turtle .
on top of baby turtle goes the baby baby baby turtle .
mama turtle goes down ... ... baby turtle goes down , baby baby turtle goes down , baby baby baby turtle goes down too .
all the thiefs are dead .
except boss kutsinawa .
he must be really old now .
he' il be dead shortly anyway .
don' t think about him .
you better think about your future .
you can stay here .
you can become a man again .
i' m fine as i am now .
where is the masseur ?
he must be somewhere around here .
but the party starts today .
you found me .
how did you know ?
bitch .
you may change as much as u want ... ... this awful smell will always stay the same .
stop bullshitting , blind man !
i proudly accept that i am boss kutsinawa .
a blind man like yourself ... ... will not slaughter me easily !
what the hell !
you' re not blind ?
not at all .
then why do you pretend to be blind ?
cause blind men can sense the world better .
i knew you could see !
i knew it from the first time you came here .
you killed my men .
and torakitsi
you killed the tavern man ...
it was a kid from the streets .
i picked him up many years ago .
i taught him the business so he could be my successor .
all my gang is gone ... ... from a wandering masseur like yourself .
how did you know that i was the real boss kutsinawa ?
from the time you threw my walking stick , to see the sword .
your the worst gangster of them all .
really ?
i' m like a cripple now .
my retirement time has arrived .
but i lived a full life .
i regret for nothing .
come on , kill me !
you don' t deserve death .
finish your life as blind man !
even with my eyes wide open ... ... i can' t see anything !
