welcome to the university of ithaca .
this is it , right here .
this is what we' re talkin ' about .
i' m gonna give you a good tour today .
show you as much as you need to know , plus a whole lot more .
so this is the main area of the university .
you' il be getting used to this area .
this is where you congregate with your friends and classmates .
come in around me , everyone .
keep close .
don' t straggle .
i' ve had problems with stragglers before , okay ?
they get lost in the back .
they get hit by trucks , okay ?
it' s not pretty .
it' s not pretty when it happens .
this is the
by the way , this is the joseph h. nelson memorial library here , okay ?
it was built , uh it was built , uh , in the 1600s .
1600s ?
it says 1951 .
that' s the address .
okay ?
wise ass .
that' s the psychology department .
each semester you' il be expected to volunteer ... for some cutting edge experimental testing .
kind of cool .
just a tip .
when it' s your turn , remember to wear loose clothes , no metal , and be prepared to receive several heavy doses of electric current .
they' re watching us right now .
over there is the department of english .
i see most of you speak english already , so we can skip that one .
how long have you been going to school here ?
eight years .
you don' t seem to know anything about it here .
this is the worst tour ever .
this is the worst school ever .
doesn' t anything cool ever happen here ?
yeah , i mean , cool stuff happens here .
this university of ithaca is the coolest , coolest place in the world .
that' s because he' s probably never been anywhere else .
go ahead , laugh .
laugh all you want .
but the fact of the matter is , this is the setting for the greatest story ever told .
okay ?
it' s about this guy i knew , josh parker , and his girl friend , tiffany .
it' s one of the most fascinating journeys ever .
josh and tiffany were always together , starting from when they were really little .
they did everything as a team .
once when tiffany was ten years old , she had her tonsils taken out .
josh stayed in the hospital for three straight days .
they were best friends .
and eventually what started out as friendship ... blossomed into some serious french kissing and lots of heavy petting .
you know , they spent so much time together that even their dogs started dating .
they seemed destined to be together forever .
but after high school , they faced their most challenging challenge ever . : a long distance relationship .
see , unfortunately , while josh was enrolled here at the wonderful university of ithaca ,
tiffany went off to veterinary school in austin , texas .
but they made a pact , a promise to stay true to each other , to talk every day and maintain an exclusive relationship .
that turned out to be more difficult than either of them had imagined .
tiffany !
hey , baby .
oh , my god .
you were amazing last night .
i never ever came like that before .
come on .
seriously !
i had to take two birth control pills this morning .
you wanna help me study again tonight ?
forget tonight .
come over now .
let' s blow this class off .
tiffany and carla can' t come to the phone , but if you leave a message , we' il call you right back .
hey , tif , it' s me ... again .
just wonderin ' where you are .
still tryin ' to get a hold of you .
everything' s cool , though .
i' m sure i' il catch you later .
call me back , okay ?
okay .
bye .
i just wanted to add something before i sent this video off .
i haven' t talked to you in a few days .
and i' m starting to think you don' t like me anymore .
no , i' m kidding .
hey , guys .
but i am getting a little worried , so gimme a call when you get a chance , okay ?
barry says " hi .
so gimme a call as soon as you can , okay ?
i miss you .
call me , okay ?
bye .
what' s up , guys ?
not much .
you ?
nothing .
i was just finishing my tape to tiffany .
hey , mitch , what are you doin ' ?
are you hungry ?
huh ?
are you gonna feed him ?
no , i' m checking the temperature inside his cage .
mitch needs an evenly distributed 85 degrees to survive .
can i drop a mouse in ?
sorry .
mitch only eats once a week , on saturdays .
maybe we could cut a mouse in half , and we could feed him half now and the other half on saturday .
i don' t think so .
i thought you had class now .
what time is it ?
oh , shit !
can you do me a favor ?
when this is done rewinding ,
will you drop it in the mail for me ?
no problem .
just leave it there .
thanks , man .
i' il see you guys later ?
bye .
can we please feed him now ?
no .
if you overfeed him , he could die .
so ?
it' il be worth it .
josh , hey .
beth , hey .
what' s goin ' on ?
not much .
where have you been ?
nowhere .
just studying a lot .
i' m starting to question this whole college thing .
no one told me there was gonna be this much reading .
right .
yeah .
oh , you going to e. l. ' s tonight ?
yeah , i' il be there .
i gotta run .
class started five minutes ago .
i' il see you tonight .
yeah .
sorry .
tonight .
so , you have a thing for that guy now , is that it ?
it' s none of your business , jacob .
i can just tell you like him .
i' m not having this conversation again .
what conversation ?
you need to stop this .
you and i , we' re not a couple .
we' ve never been a couple , and we will never be one .
this week i' d like you ... to think about plato' s dialogues of the middle years , i . e .
the republic , phaedo , symposium .
now , this will all be on next week' s midterm , so ...
i suggest you read up on it .
ah , jacob , do you have anything to add ?
just a reminder .
the midterm will cover all of the in class lectures ... as well as all of the assigned readings .
it will be entirely essay form , so bring legal pads .
i prefer yellow .
it' s easier on the eyes .
okay .
okay ?
yeah .
thank you, jacob .
and ... see you all next week for the midterm .
josh .
yes ?
i saw you hitting on beth .
not a good idea .
she' s spoken for .
what ?
she' il come back to me .
they always do .
so , mr. parker .
do you intend to be ready for this exam ?
yes , sir .
well , you better be ready .
because i was looking over the books last night , and you need a " b " on this test just to pass this class .
actually , i double checked that , professor .
he needs a " b " plus .
we' re not gonna be able to bend on this .
yeah , i got it .
just copy off someone .
i can' t .
it' s all essays and stuff .
if i fail this class , my average is shot .
i might lose my financial aid .
i could not be allowed back next semester .
well , you' re fucked then .
you might as well come to my party tonight .
hook up with beth , and at least enjoy your last week at college .
i' m not hooking up with anyone .
i made a commitment to tiffany .
i' m invested in this relationship .
invested ?
who are you , charles schwab ?
would you listen to yourself ?
i would give my life ... for one evening of consensual sex with that girl .
i' ve gone this long without cheating .
i think i can hold out .
you' re already cheating !
any time you pass up sex , you' re cheating on yourself .
think about it .
you' re in college .
the window of opportunity to drink and do drugs ... and take advantage of young girls is getting smaller by the day .
i gotta make a call .
i' m telling you .
you pass this up , it' il haunt you for the rest of your days .
your dick will never forgive you .
what do you think , little man ?
don' t you ever want to experience something new ?
it ain' t easy being josh' s penis .
we' ve been here over two months , and i feel like i' m in a coma .
stop it .
i wish i was your dick , e. l. this is torture .
if something doesn' t happen soon , i' m gonna pack up my balls and leave .
enough .
hello ?
carla , it' s josh .
i' m sorry to bother you .
is tiffany around ?
tiffany is not here .
she didn' t sleep here last night ... again .
and it would be great if one hour went by when you didn' t call .
right .
if she wanted to talk to you , she' d call you .
deal with it .
what a bitch !
does she sound hot ?
we' ve never gone this long without talking .
something is definitely wrong .
yeah , she found someone else like you should do .
the clock is ticking .
before you know it , you' re gonna be 40 and have to pay for these kind a girls .
* she good looking got a mojo cooking *
* yeah , wouldn' t give me the time of day *
* but if my occupation was a star in the constellation *
* we could get together in the milky way *
* and every body wanna know somebody *
* everyone wants to drop your name *
* you need no reservation no special invitation *
* no college education if you' ve got fortune and fame *
oh , yeah !
whoo hoo !
i should really warn you , though , it' s been known ... to severely affect your decision making abilities and lowers your inhibitions .
good .
that' s the plan .
no , that that' s yes , that is the plan .
did you bring some cash ?
why ?
we' ve got chicks for sale .
what ?
* hey , now i' m snappy got my mojo track **
trust me .
i' ve been goin ' to this school for seven years .
and i know the key to a well rounded college education ... is experimentation .
let me show you .
this is an auction .

i know , i know .

it' il be fun .
i' ve always wanted to try this .
no .
yes .
i' m gonna interview you .

what do you look for in a girl ?
well , let' s see .
she should be smart and funny and
that' s good too .
do you feel better yet ?
i feel a little bit better .
yeah .
a little .
what else do you look for ?
she should be attractive and ... nice and
topless .
and topless .
and she should kiss me .
what else ?
she shouldn' t stop kissing me .
why don' t you keep doing that ?

what are you so happy about ?
i don' t know .
do i seem happy this morning ?
well , you' re bouncing around here like you' re richard fuckin ' simmons .
yeah , you do seem unusually light hearted today , josh .
huh .
maybe it' s because i had the best time of my life last night .
twice !
and once this morning .
you and beth ?
oh , yeah .
shut up .
what happened ?
no way !
you' re lying .
i' m not lying .
you can' t make out with someone , then pretend you had sex with them .
that' s really , really uncool .
i' m not pretending .
forget it .
i know you' re lying .
i guarantee he' s lying .
you wanna bet ?
great .
i' m gonna bet money on something you can' t prove .
you videotaped it !

he' s got a point .
oh , no !
oh , no !

e. l , no .
josh , please ?
we need this .
okay , listen , seriously .
you can never tell anyone you saw this .
oh , yeah .

okay !
barry , hit the lights .
it' s boner time !
hey , tif .
it' s me coming toyou live from lthaca , new york .
i thought i asked you to mail this yesterday .
yeah , it was on your desk .
i mailed it this morning .
barry , fast forward to the horny stuff .
* i got a girl * is this the kind of shit you' ve been sending tiffany ?
oh , my god .
* it' s you *
oh , fuck !
oh , my god !
no , no , no , no .
oh , god !
w wait a second .
tell me you mailed the beth tape to tiffany .
yes !
shit !
oh , no !
oh , no !
what ?
hey , hey .
did you make a copy ?
' cause if you made a copy , we could watch the copy .
don' t answer it .
it' s josh and rubin .
leave a message .
hi , josh .
it' s tiffany .
sorry we haven' t spoken .
listen , my grand father passed away .
i' ve tried calling you a few times , but no one picked up .
i didn' t want to leave this message on your machine .
but by now you' re probably a little worried , so
anyway , i' m at my parents ' house helping my mom out .
she' s really a wreck .
if i don' t speak with you , i' il call you monday when i' m back at school .
i' il be okay .
i just need some time .
bye .
i love you .
that' s not fair .
how come she gets to see the tape and we don' t ?
she gets back there monday .
that leaves me three days to get there .
get where ?
austin ?
that' s like 10, 000 miles from here .
eighteen hundred .
you wanna drive 1, 800 miles in three days ?
just fly .
do you have money for a ticket ?
i don' t .
all right , so we' re driving .
you' re coming ?
what else am i gonna do ?
stay here and learn ?
road trip .
just a minute .
hold on .
he' s probably jackin ' off .
what do you guys want ?
kyle , this is an emergency .
wait .
let me at least go back and call my dad .
call your dad ?
would you listen to yourself ?
you' re 19 years old , and you' re a fucking sissy .
all you ever do is sit in a library and play myst with exchange students .
it' s pathetic .
no , no .
what he' s trying to say is this is your chance to do something for once .
be a risk taker .
come with us .
you guys are just saying that because you want my car .
no !
no , we' ve always liked you .
or you can just give us the car .
that would make him a risk taker , right ?
shut up , all right ?
he' s coming with us .
come on , kyle .
it' il be fun !
aren' t you even curious where we' re going ?
no .
okay .
we' re going to the university of austin .
sure you don' t wanna come ?
i don' t like massachusetts .
austin' s in texas , not massachusetts .
you' re thinking of boston .
you' ve never left this town , have you , barry ?
no , not really .
you should look into that .
that could turn into a debilitating phobia .
okay , i' il do that .
can i feed mitch ?
yes , actually you can .
you can feed him .
but not till tomorrow .
there' s a brown box full of mice next to his cage .
give him one tomorrow .
and no messing around , barry .
okay ?
just one .
i' il feed him a mouse tomorrow , okay ?
okay .
yeah .
you can count on me .
okay ?
i' m reliable .
you guys do good .
have a good trip , safe trip , safe journey .
buckle up your seat belt .
i' m gonna feed the snake for you .
so off they went .
they had 1, 800miles to go , and only three days to do it .
it was a killer journey , and it was one that changed them forever .
the end .
so we' re gonna go look over here now .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
that' s it ?
this story sucks .
that can' t be the whole story .
what happened with the tape ?
right .
the tape .
well , like i said , they were on a race against time .
* smokestack spitting black soot into the sunny sky *
* the load on the road brings a tear to the indian' s eye *
since we didn' t get to see the tape ,
can you at least describe it to us ?
no .
* the elephant won' t forget what it' s like inside his cage *
* thering master' s telling the cows the scene' s on an empty stage *
admit that beth is amazing .
i admit it .
she' s amazing .
she' s perfect .
there you go .
i don' t know why you feel so guilty .
technically you haven' t cheated on tiffany .
what are you talking about ?
there are these rules that guys have , an understanding as to what exactly constitutes cheating .
take your situation , for example .
it' s not cheating .
it' s never cheating ... when you' re in a different area code , not to mention a different state .
that makes no sense .
don' t look at me , kyle .
i didn' t make up the rules .
this is legit .
i' ve actually read an article about this .
there' s a whole bunch of them .
they' re like loopholes .
right ?
for argument' s sake , let' s say you were sleeping with two girls at the same time .
it wouldn' t be cheating , because they would cancel each other out .
ahh .
exactly !
or if you' re too wasted to remember ?
it is not cheating .
because if you can' t really remember it , it never really took place .
* uh huh *
* whoo oo *
i' ve got one .
are you ready ?
it' s not cheating if you spread peanut butter all over your testicles ... and let your dog lick it off .
because it' s your dog !
jesus christ !
you know , because it' s your dog !
yeah , we got it .
* whoo oo , uh huh *
* god damn right it' s a beautiful day *
* uh huh god damn right **
somebody' s gonna die tomorrow .
that' s right .
one of you is marked for death .
and the first thing tomorrow morning , a chosen one will experience nature' s wrath ... in all its fury .
* ah ah ah ah *
* ah ah ah ah *
who are you ?
i' m beth .
are you here for the feeding ?
excuse me ?
you' re early .
it' s not till tomorrow .
you should come back .
it' s gonna be a bloodbath .
i think i' il pass .
have you seen josh ?
he went to visit his girl friend .
tiffany ?
i thought they broke up .
i mean , this girl who' s a friend of his .
you know what i mean .
where did he go ?
austin ?
austin , massachusetts ?
you mean boston , massachusetts ?
yeah , that' s what i said .
boston .
the university of boston in massachusetts .
he is such an asshole .
i can' t believe he just lied to my face like that .
i actually thought he liked me .
how could he do that ?
wait , she was standing around topless ?
girls don' t stand around naked .
yeah , they do .
okay ?
this is my story .
do you wanna hear it or not ?
it just doesn' t make any  shh .
please , no interruptions .
so this other girl walks up , totally hot .
naked !
really naked !
i know guys can be jerks .
i guess i just thought josh was different .
i liked him .
sweetie , listen to me .
they' re all the same .
all men are perverted pigs .
all they think about , all they really care about , is sex .
you' re so right .
you should go to boston and bust his ass .
right ?
confront him and his little girl friend .
* i' m freakin ' you baby , drivin ' me crazy *
* i' m freakin ' you , baby drivin ' me crazy *
* i' m freakin ' you , baby drivin ' me crazy *
oh !
these too .
* i' m freakin ' you , baby drivin ' me crazy *
kyle , come here for a second .
look , we' re a little short on cash right now , so we' re gonna need to put this on your credit card .
we' il give you the cash when we get back .
i promise .
i can' t .
it' s my dad' s .
it' s for emergencies only .
hello !
this is an emergency .
we need this stuff .
you want us to sleep in the dirt ?
* i' m freakin ' you , baby drivin ' me crazy *
* when i get to your place *
* i wanna turn up the highs and turn up the bass **
well , i' d say we' re officially in no man' s land .
we' ve been on this road for over an hour .
this is gonna save us five hours minimum .
so thank me later , josh , okay ?
maybe we should turn around and go back to the interstate .
we' re not goin ' back .
we' re not goin ' back .
have some faith , kyle .
it' s supposed to be a challenge .
that' s why they call it a shortcut .
if it was easy , it would just be the way .
damn it !
fuck !
yep , i give us about 20 minutes before our first ass raping .
what do we do now ?
if we turn around , we' re gonna lose five hours back tracking .
turn around ?
why ?
because of this ?
we can make it .
make it ?
you mean jump it ?
no .
absolutely not .
no way .
we' re going back .
it can be done .
this incline is 30 degrees roughly , right ?
factory weight of the car is 1, 600 .
add our weight plus cargo , 2, 100 pounds .
no , no .
if we hit this at 50 miles per hour , our trajectory will clear ten feet , easy .
no way .
absolutely not .
kyle , we' il go 60 just to be certain .
we' re goin ' back .
this is impossible .
you sure ?
of course i' m sure .
with physics i' m always sure .
yes .
i' m driving .
i don' t think you guys heard me .
this is my car , and we' re not gonna be jumping over any rivers .
kyle , it' s ten feet .
bob hope could jump this in a golf cart .
look , i can spit across this gap .
yeah .
well , better make it 75 .
okay .
let' s do it .
trust me , kyle , it' s science .
no , you guys .
no .
e. l. , get out of my car .
kyle , in the car .
come on .
we' re okay .
you know we need to hit 60 , right ?
i' m trying .
this car sucks .
stop !
thank you !
yes !
what did i tell you ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
my father is gonna kill me when he finds out about this .
i only said we' d make it across .
i never said anything about the wheels staying on .
what the hell are we gonna do now ?
i' m totally screwed !
i don' t have time to be walking through the woods right now .
josh , we' re gonna call a tow truck .
we' il have the axles fixed .
we' il probably lose halfa day .
it' il be fine .
it' s just the wheels !
the minute i think i feel something for someone , they just turn around and screw me over .
just something about josh .
he' s just different .
i feel like we had a connection .
i don' t think i' il ever be able to trust a guy .
you shouldn' t !
honey , the last time i trusted a man was 1 985 , and he took off with my sister and my van .
it was a regular size van .
that was before they started making that minivan crap .
so there' s no hope , huh ?
oh , there' s hope .
but it comes with batteries .
you can keep that .
god .
crap .
listen , guys , we' re gonna have to be more careful .
we almost died in that explosion .
i wish i had died .
i' m serious .
i can' t die young .
something tells me the people of earth are gonna need me .
i must live .
yeah , right .
we all must live .
before we do that , we must figure out how to get back on the road .
we shouldn' t be going to sleep right now .
let' s lay an indication here and there of some little shadow areas .
excuse me .
i' m sorry , do you need to get that ?
do you need something ?
yeah .
this is sort of an unusual question .
but do you have any marijuana i might be able to buy from you ?
our car exploded last night , and i' m practically out of my own .
am i a drug dealer ?
no , i am not .
thank you for asking though .
no ?
okay , that' s okay .
thanks .
is there anything else i can help you with ?
perhaps you' d like an 11 year old prostitute sent to your room .
we can do that .
or maybe we can off someone for you .
huh ?
how' s that sound ?
i' ve got it .
why don' t we start small ?
would you like a fresh towel ?
maybe you could roll that up and smoke it .
dick .
by the way , cheech .
that credit card you guys gave me last night was maxed out .
so don' t go spending all your cash on needles and guns just yet .
um , mr. earl edwards ?
i' m sorry , sir .
this card' s over its limit .
that' s not true .
put it through your little machine again .
i ran it through three times , sir .
it keeps telling me you' re over your limit .
if you have another card , i' d be happy to  don' t give me any attitude .
you go fix that little toy back there , and charge this friggin ' meal to that friggin ' card .
we' ve been coming here for 20 years .
we' ve only been open eight years , sir .
do it now .
relax , it' s not that big a deal .
