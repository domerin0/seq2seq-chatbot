they were doing some spiel for the chemistry department . . . . . . so bob shine introduces us .
you' il love this .
he looks right at me . . . . . . and congratulates me on spencer' s theorem .
he didn' t know your father was dead ?
he knew .

tonight .
we' re going to be  fashionably five minutes late .
are you saying he murdered his wife ?
is that so ridiculous ?
she was terrified . . . . . . and now she doesn' t answer the door , but her car' s in the garage .
maybe she was out , or in bed with the flu .
or maybe she was abducted by aliens .
who are you calling ?
restaurant .
we' re not at the center of the bridge .
you can' t get service until the center .
i know we' re not at the center .
there .
see ?
well , that' s a relief .
hi , stan .
hey , claire .
norman .
sorry we' re late .
it' s my fault .
we just got here .
where' s the new squeeze ?
here i am .
this is  elena ?
oh , my god .
claire !
i don' t believe it !
this is  we know each other .
norman .
hello , norman .
how do you do ?
claire , look at you !
you look beautiful .
here was this brilliant conductor in purple bikini briefs . . . . . . with no bangs . . .
. . . cursing his ass off in finnish .
oh , claire .
i made an honest woman of her .
how long have you been in vermont ?
oh , well , norman grew up here .
remember beau flynn , head of cardio at the hospital ?
he was just sacked .
i just dropped her off at college .
he was involved in some stalking incident .
an intern , some girl .
we' re getting so old !
they don' t screw around with that anymore .
when did we last get together ?
new york .
of course .
right after  right after michael died .
michael who ?
marlov .
claire' s first husband .
oh , the musician .
yeah .
you know , we all toured together .
have you heard her play ?
no .
i would sit on stage . . . . . . during claire' s solo . . . . . . and i mean , truly , i had tears streaming down my face .
i mean , she' s fabulous .
so why did you stop ?
well , one night , after a concert . . . . . . i met a dashing , handsome . . . . . . genius scientist . . . . . . and three months later , i was married .
is that when you guys moved up to vermont ?
no , we were living in boston . . . . . . when norman was offered a position .
a position .
the dupont chair in genetics .
i see .
so now you' re teaching at your father' s school here .
i actually don' t . . . . . . do much teaching anymore .
i run a research project .
norman' s father had this old stuffy
stately place on a lake .
which we' re renovating .
practically gutted .
no , we didn' t .
yes , we did .
gutted .
wait till you see it .
it' s beautiful .
it is beautiful .
you' il see it .
it' s haunted .
no .
is it really ?
claire' s hearing things .
what ?
what are you hearing ?
i don' t know .
i heard . . . . . . voices , whispering . . . .
a picture fell .
you know , i completely believe in all that .
you do ?
i do .
wait a minute .
who do you think it is ?
i know exactly who it is .
it' s my old man .
he' s pissed about us dicking around with the house .
claire .
jesus . . . .
it' s all right .
calm down , claire .
it' s okay .
whose idea was it ?
mine .
his .
we both thought . . . .
i didn' t want to come here .
then why did you ?
he was worried about me .
your husband ?
yes .
i' m sure he' s hoping you' il pack me full of prozac or lithium . . . . . . so he can live out his life in peace .
do you really think so ?
no .
are you on medication ?
no .
well , valium .
for sleeping .
having trouble sleeping ?
sometimes .
when i get anxious .
do you get anxious only at night ?
no , i only take valium at night .
for sleeping .
why do you get anxious ?
i don' t know .
why do you think your husband' s worried ?
because . . . .
i don' t know .
because ever since caitlin left
ever since my daughter left for school . . . . . . there have been . . . .
i' ve been . . . .
why is this so hard ?
here .
have a fireball .
thank you .
it' s hard because i' m a complete stranger . . . . . . and you' re talking about incredibly personal things .
besides , most people , when they come the first time , are wondering . . . . . . if i think they' re crazy .
don' t worry .
i' m required . . . . . . to have three sessions before i can commit .
that was a joke .
these are good .
they' re hot .
there' s a ghost in my house .
i saw her in the water , beside me . . . . . . in the bathtub .
what does she look like ?
she looked like . . . . . . me .
only she had green eyes .
any idea who she is ?
maybe .
but i' d rather not say just yet .
fine .
what do you think i should do ?
try to contact her .
communicate with her somehow .
find out what she wants .
what do you want me to do ?
go buy a ouija board ?
are we hoping the ghost will have to use the potty ?
this is where she was .
this is where l . . . . . . saw her .
that makes sense .
where did you finally find one ?
kmart .
i think we' re supposed to sit in a protective circle , aren' t we ?
what' s that for ?
where did you get it ?
never mind .
you stole her shoe .
you have to have something of the dead woman' s .
says who ?
is that blood on it ?
i don' t know .
just place your fingers on the message indicator .
okay .
we wish to commune . . . . . . with the spirit
what ?
wish to commune .
forget it .
what ?
no , this whole thing is insane .
i' m sorry .
what' s her first name ?
mary .
feur .
mary feur , mary feur . . . .
we wish to communicate . . . . . . with the spirit of mary feur .
not much happening .
what was that ?
it' s flickering .
yeah .
did you see that ?
yeah .
cooper !
listen ... . . . about our little sance .
norman doesn' t need to know .
i won' t tell if you won' t .
it' s just that . . . . . . ever since the accident . . . . . . he treats me like i' m this . . . . . . fragile , loopy . . . .
well , i am seeing ghosts in the bathtub , aren' t l ?
you did wrap your car around a tree doing , like , 80 .
he was pretty shaken up .
we all were .
it was an accident .
a year ago .
i' m fine .
right ?
of course you are .
you' re just not much of a medium , however .
i' il call you tomorrow .
get some rest .
did you pick up any dudes yet ?
i have one in the trunk .
bye .
what do you want ?
she' s dead .
who' s dead ?
you know damn well who' s dead .
the feur thing .
listen to me .
he killed her and i' m not crazy .
jody and i had a sance in the bathroom , and nothing happened . . . . . . but when i went back there she was there .
she was .
wait a minute .
you had a sance ?
are you angry with me ?
what ?
maybe you resent how busy i' ve been .
no .
you know what i' ve got at stake for this paper .
how important it is to me .
i can' t help feeling that you' re trying to sabotage me , to hurt me .
norman , this isn' t about you .
something is happening to me .
and it' s not to get even , and it' s not some warped bid for attention .
something is happening in our house , whether you like it or not .
claire .
claire , stop .
you' re overreacting .
don' t tell me how to react .
will you keep your voice down ?
i will not !
maybe you' re right .
maybe i am losing my mind .
but what if i' m not ?
what if she died . . . . . . some horrible death ?
can we please not do this here ?
oh , wow .
you .
you think you' re smart , don' t you ?
you think you got away with it .
well , i know you killed her , you murdering son of a bitch !
who ?
don' t give me that shit .
your wife .
she' s very upset .
forgive us , please .
honey .
i didn' t kill my wife .
are you all right ?
come on , honey .
come on .
let' s go .
i' m sorry .
you all right ?
oh .
yeah .
i' m fine .
what happened ?
just now ?
i just saw norman' s face .
he was so frightened for me .
how' s your marriage ?
good .
really good .
we' ve had our moments , i guess . . . . . . but he' s a wonderful husband and father .
i mean , sure , he can be obsessed with his work . . . . . . and sometimes it' s like . . .
. . . that he doesn' t see me .
or , you know . . . . . . iike i' m . . . .
that there' s something wrong . . .
. . . with me .
that can' t feel good .
no .
okay .
i see where you' re going with this . . . . . . but my marriage is fine .
no .
i have had some kind of empty nest episode . . . . . . where i saw . . . . . . some things that weren' t there .
let' s deal with that .
i' m willing to deal with that .
thought you might need this .
love , jody .
mrs. spencer .
i wanted to apologize for scaring you like i did .
when i thought about how it must have seemed
please .
let' s just . . . .
claire spencer .
mary feur .
would you like a cup of coffee ?
very much .
that day at the fence ... . . . you seemed terrified .
i don' t think i imagined that .
no .
what were you so afraid of ?
have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone . . . . . . that you couldn' t breathe ?
thought that your time together was so . . . . . . passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they' d leave ?
sure .
i couldn' t catch my breath . . . . . . and i panicked .
i never dreamed anyone would hear me .
i tried to leave him .
i went to my mother' s in providence . . . . . . but he brought my things up . . . . . . in the middle of the night . . . . . . during the rainstorm .
he pleaded with me to come home .
you must think i' m pathetic .
no .
i don' t .
i' il be quick .
i' ve got to get sidon to okay my budget before his trip .
what' s templeton' s wife' s name again ?
lois .
phil and lois templeton .
don' t let her corner you , she' il chew your ear off .
evening , phil .
here they are .
how do you do ?
hi .
hi .
nice to see you again , lois .
white wine , please .
how are you holding up ?
just fine .
it' s a lovely party .
norman was telling me the house is finished .
almost .
wonderful .
it' s good to see you doing so well .
thank you .
well , i was worried .
i don' t think i' ve seen you since norman' s reception here last year .
you were worried ?
i swear , i' ve become that nosy old lady i used to run away from at amherst .
no , i' m just not sure what you mean .
you got so upset .
oh , at the party .
for the dupont chair .
you remember ?
well , i remember the party , but . . . .
oh , god !
i had completely forgotten .
i broke your crystal .
oh , my dear .
a cheap wine glass from the caterers .
but you went completely pale .
you couldn' t catch your breath .
it was as if you had seen a ghost .
missing girl .
madison elizabeth .
m e.
frank .
madison elizabeth . . .
. . . frank .
m e f.
claire ?
hey , good morning .
up all night ?
you okay ?
do you remember this ?
it' s the girl that disappeared last year .
did you know her ?
no .
claire , i' m afraid to ask .
where' s all this going ?
it' s her .
the woman i saw in the bathtub .
the ghost ?
yes , the ghost .
i thought it was mrs. feur , but it' s not .
i' m positive this time .
claire , stop it !
stop it .
i know you' re going through something i don' t understand .
i have tried to be here for you , but this is enough , claire .
enough .
do you want to go see somebody together ?
i' il call dr. drayton .
then what , claire ?
what ?
tell me what to do .
it' s her .
so let me ask you this . . . .
mr. mccain ?
mccann .
mccann .
nothing was ever found ?
no car , or . . . ?
listen ....
this girl' s a real live wire .
she drives around in a souped up mustang convertible .
most people think she' s ... ... off around mexico or somewhere with her friends .
the police downgraded it to a runaway .
her mother lives out here in addison county .
mrs. frank ?
yeah ?
i' m claire .
i wanted to talk to you about madison .
just plain coffee .
none of that mocha nonsense .
fine .
you look a little old for a student .
i' m not a student .
we met at a party .
well , that sounds about right .
i never understood how a girl that wild got all a' s .
she liked to read a lot , though .
sometimes she' d lock herself up in her room for days , just reading .
they wanted to put her in a school for the gifted when she was young .
maddie wouldn' t hear about it .
i don' t know where she got it .
she didn' t get it from me .
she probably got it from her father' s side of the family .
she never really mentioned her father .
yeah , well , she wouldn' t .
she was 1 2 when he left .
never spoke about him after that .
you don' t even need the sound .
you can pretty much tell what' s happening by the faces .
i turn it up sometimes , though .
feels like there' s someone here .
why are you here ?
i don' t know .
you want to see her room ?
full scholarship .
princeton too .
she wanted to stay on the east coast .
you must be so proud .
these are the last pictures taken of her .
the police used this one .
let me get that .
excuse me .
claire ?
claire ?
hello , dr. spencer .
mrs. spencer .
forbidden fruit .
you got a problem with that ?
guess this means you' re not mad at me anymore , huh ?
i wouldn' t go that far .
take it easy , huh ?
what' s got into you ?
ow !
what' s the matter ?
it' s too rough .
since when ?
this is a brand new
okay , claire , that' s  why don' t you shut up , professor ?
why don' t you just . . . . . . shut up ?
i think she' s starting to suspect something .
who ?
your wife .
stop it !
you know .
what the hell are you doing ?
i know .
i was there .
just before the accident .
i remember now .
what ?
i came to the door .
there was whispering .
i saw you in the mirror . . .
. . . iying there with her . . . . . . in our house .
claire , listen to me .
she was at the dupont party . . . . . . staring at me .
it was her .
that' s why i couldn' t breathe .
that' s why i dropped the glass .
honey , that was last year .
we were having troubles .
so you slept with a fucking student ?
that' s not what i' m saying .
don' t touch me .
get away from me .
get out !
i said , get out !
fine .
claire , please , please .
i gave up everything .
claire , please don' t . . . .
my life , my music .
i never asked you to quit .
there was never any other choice !
you had to topple perfect daddy .
that meant perfect wife .
perfect family .
that' s not fair .
you were touring with a baby . . . . . . and you were happy to give it up .
when you did , you hated me for it , so you gave it all to her .
who ?
caitlin !
leave her out of this .
and then some bright young woman finds me attractive .
stop it !
and i slipped !
god help me , i slipped !
i' m not gonna listen .
claire , i tried to break it off .
you should' ve tried harder .
i was in adamant .
in adamant ?
you know , that artsy little hippie village a couple hours away down on 7 .
i stopped at this caf to get coffee , and i see norman sitting in the back .
but he wasn' t alone .
it was a young blond woman .
i didn' t see her face .
i didn' t think anything of it at first .
and i was walking over to say hello .
and they started arguing in such a way . . .
. . . that it stopped me .
then a few days later , you were in the accident .
and i get a bizarre call from stan working at the hospital . . . . . . asking me , was i with you that day ?
if you were upset about anything .
he made it sound like you had deliberately . . . . . . driven your car into a tree .
and i thought , " oh , my god .
claire' s found out .
and when i went to the hospital , i see norman .
and he was so desperate at the thought . . .
. . . of losing you .
i couldn' t say anything .
please . . .
. . . don' t hate me , claire .
i don' t hate you .
hello , this is miss jody .
can ' t get to the phone .
leave your name and i' il call you back .
jody , it' s norman .
i' m looking for claire .
will you please ... ... ask her to call home , please ?
i can' t talk to him .
will you call and tell him i' il be home in the morning ?
i have to ask him something .
norman ?
norman ?
norman !
oh , god !
how' s his blood pressure ?
1 40/ 80 .
how about his rhythm ?
rhythm is normal .
normal sinus .
no sign of arrhythmia .
good .
pulse/ ox is normal .
his pupils were equal .
i' d still like to take you down .
i' m fine , really .

you' re welcome .
you know , if that breaker hadn' t popped , he . . . .

you just keep him quiet tonight , okay ?
you might want to think twice about keeping anything electrical . . . . . . next to the tub .
oh , thank you .
goodbye .
call me , okay ?
i called you last night .
i left a message on jody' s machine .
i want you to answer one question .
did you have anything to do with her disappearance ?
yes .
i had an affair with her .
and when i tried to break it off . . . . . . she became unstable .
she came out here to the house .
she threatened to kill herself . . .
. . . or you .
i didn' t think she' d go through with any of it .
but then she . . . .
she disappeared .
it was her , norman .
she tried to kill you .
claire .
you said it yourself .
she wanted you dead .
are you saying i was attacked by a ghost ?
you had an affair with a girl . . . . . . who threatened to kill herself , and now there' s a presence in our house .
a young , blond girl .
don' t you get it ?
she did it , norman .
she' s dead . . . . . . and now she' s trying to hurt you or both of us .
you don' t know that she' s dead .
of course we do !
it' s the only thing that makes
oh , god .
it' s my fault .
i. . . .
i opened the door .
madison .
i stole her hair .
from where ?
and it gave her power .
claire .
nothing attacked me .
there are no ghosts .
it was an accident .
i' m fine .
it' s not your fault .
are you listening to me ?
yes .
claire , say it .
it was an accident .
it' s not my fault .
say it , claire .
i need to go lie down .
i didn' t sleep last night , and i need to lie down .
i want to be alone for a while .
hey , teddy , it' s me .
right , yeah .
what' s the name of that friend of yours ?
that who you gonna call guy ?
the guy that does the paranormal psych stuff ?
holodnik .
could you contact him and ask him to give me a call here ?
i' d really like to talk to him today .
hello .
yes , this is he .
thanks for calling back .
no , sir .
that was my father .
yeah , he passed away a couple of years ago .
yes , he was .
thank you .
look , the reason i' m calling is . . . .
i' m a little out of my depth here .
someone who is very close to me . . . . . . believes herself to be or seems to be . . . . . . in contact with some kind of . . . . . . entity or spirit , and
no , there' s no . . . . . . no history of delusional behavior .
well , i guess what i' m asking is , is it possible that she could be . . . . . . causing these manifestations . . . . . . through some kind of unconscious or telekinetic ?
is there anything else that it could be ?
and this has been documented ?
really ?
i' m sorry , but could i call you back . . . . . . or have you call me back ?
please , yes , that' il be great .
thank you , sir .
claire !
you all right , claire ?
the braid !
where' s the braid ?
what are you talking about ?
what are you talking about ?
this ?
is this what you' re talking about ?
where' d you get this ?
i took it from madison' s house .
this is hers ?
this is madison frank' s hair ?
what do you think ?
i really don' t know .
norman .
yes . . .
. . . i believe you .
hey , coop .
you' re playing .
she' s gone .
how do you know ?
i can feel it .
i picked up the book you ordered at the bookstore .
claire , i don' t know how to apologize to you for what i' ve done .
but if you give me another chance . . .
. . . i promise i' il spend the rest of my life making you glad that you did .
please .
last sail of the year .
beautiful , isn' t it ?
we ought to take a drive before the leaves all disappear .
stay at a little bed and breakfast .
look for antiques .
yeah , we haven' t done that for a while .
adamant .
adamant ?
an artsy little village down 7 .
supposed to be charming .
do you know it ?
no .
maybe we' il stop there for lunch .
what' s that for ?
nothing .
god , oh , god . . . .
you don' t understand what that is .
don' t i , norman ?
that' s madison' s necklace .
you killed her , didn' t you ?
i did not .
i didn' t kill anyone .
jesus , claire .
listen to me .
when i got here . . . . . . she was already dead .
she killed herself in our house to destroy me .
do you think i' m stupid ?
she left that for you in the garden , with a letter .
i burned the letter and threw the box in the lake .
a week before . . .
. . . she showed up at the dupont party .
i was terrified .
she insisted , so i agreed to meet her here .
when i got here . . . . . . she had taken pills .
i tried to revive her , but . . . . . . she was gone .
there was nothing i could do .
so i put her in her car . . . . . . and i drove to the boat ramp . . . . . . and i rolled it out into the lake .
i made a terrible mistake .
i know that .
but tell me , claire .
what should i have done ?
should i sacrifice everything ?
our marriage ?
my work , which i spent my whole life on ?
tell me , claire .
tell me , please .
because we can put this behind us .
our life can go on .
it' s not too late .
what are you asking me to do ?
i' m asking you to forgive me .
that girl must be brought up .
hello .
this is dr. norman spencer .
i have some information . . . . . . about a missing person .
madison frank , yes .
could you send an officer out to the house , please ?
1 5 willoughby lane .
it' s about a mile from the bridge .
okay .
thank you .
i' m gonna go get dressed .
information .
what city ?
don' t !
stop it !
i begged you , claire .
i pleaded with you .
but you wouldn' t let it go .
oh , claire .
i never wanted any of this to happen .
all i ever wanted . . .
. . . was for you to love me .
be proud of me .
to be happy .
she was going to go to the dean .
she would have ruined us .
did she think i was just gonna sit there . . . . . . and watch it happen ?
you have no idea what it was like .
hold her underwater . . .
. . . watch her life slip away .
but she gave me no choice .
and neither have you .
i can' t figure out how you put it all together .
at first i thought you knew .
thought you created the whole ghost thing as an elaborate trap .
then i realized you believed it .
it was a passive aggressive masterpiece .
the first time i met you . . . . . . all i ever wanted was to spend the rest of my life with you .
it' s not gonna happen now .
too cold .
i almost froze to death laying here . . . . . . wet , naked , pretending to be electrocuted .
hey , coop .
how you doing ?
how you doing , boy ?
let' s go get your ball .
come on .
jody , it' s norman .
if you' re there , pick up , please .
it' s norman .
listen , claire and l . . .
. . . had a terrible blowout .
could you do me a favor ?
i' m sleeping at the lab .
could you check on her in the morning ?
i' m worried about her .
thanks .
the halothane' s starting to wear off .
i' m sure in some . . .
. . . tragic way , your suicide is gonna . . . . . . help bring caitlin and i closer together .
and every time i look at her . . .
. . . i' il see you .
oh , god .
what' s this ?
oh , shit .
i' m on the bridge !
somebody help me !
i' m on the bridge !
no !
i beg you . . . . . . think of caitlin .
please , don' t .
please .
