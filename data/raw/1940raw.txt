i' ve left my wife .
i' ve left my wife .
what did she say ?
don' t forget your tuxedo .
she even helped me pack .
we' re still friends , i think .
i have to go home to get some more things my books , my tuxedo ... and i want to make sure she' s all right .
we didn' t argue .
i know you agree .
we have to live in a glass house with no secrets .
we couldn' t live in lies anymore .
we have to live in truth .
sabina , would you mind if i stayed here for a while ?
if it' s no imposition .
until i get my bearings .
if it' s all right , i' il ...
i' il come back tomorrow ... and , uh ...
oh ...
oh , god .
ha ha ...
good bye , tereza .
see you again , i' m sure .
listen , tereza ...
i want you to leave now .
i have things i must do .
sabina ?
maybe i should have stayed .
stop running .
stop leaving .
franz was such a good man .
so ... what are you going to do now ?
leave .
haha ha ...
ah , sabina .
i don' t know .
i' il go to ...
paris , maybe .
or to america .
come to me .
you want to see america ?
hmm ?
sometime .
maybe i' m seeing you for the last time .
maybe .
karenin .
tomas , i know
i' m supposed to help you , but i can' t .
instead of being your support ,
i' m your weight .
life is very heavy to me , and it is so light to you .
i can' t bear this lightness , this freedom .
i' m not strong enough .
in prague ,
i only needed you for love .
in switzerland ,
i was dependent on you for everything .
what would happen if you abandoned me ?
i' m weak .
i' m going back to the country of the weak .
good bye .
i' m sorry , but i' ve taken karenin .
and your camera .
haha !
ah , cognac ?
haha !
are you all right ?
yes , fine .
and karenin ?
fine , too .
what are you going to do here ?
i' il find something .
oh , tomas .
tomas .
tomas .
tomas .
oh ...
oh !
oh ...
oh ...
i really don' t like to do this .
i shouldn' t have to do this .
you remember the article you wrote about king oedipus ?
how communist leaders should have put out their eyes ?
yes , i' d almost forgotten .
well , they haven' t .
they' ve prepared this little letter ... sort of retraction .
say you got it wrong , you really didn' t understand ...
you sign .
that' s all .
don' t misunderstand .
they' re not asking for a public declaration .
they' re just prudent bureaucrats .
they' ve given me their word .
they won' t publish anything .
i need you , tomas .
i hope i can keep you .
you' re not a writer , savior of the country .
you' re a doctor .
a scientist .
this article' s so terribly important to you ?
it couldn' t be less important .
hi , tomas .
hi .
tomas .
hello , jiri !
it' s nice to see you back .
how are you ?
thanks , fine .
so ... are you going to sign the ... thing ?
what thing ?
mmm ... your , um ... retraction .
what do you know about my retraction ?
have you read it ?
no .
but you know how things work .
who told you i had agreed to go along with it ?
see you .
haha ha ...
i suppose a lot of them have signed these letters .
they' re kept on file .
they know they can be published at any moment , so they keep quiet , see ?
they can' t say anything anymore .
they accept everything .
cowardice slowly becomes a rule of life .
yes , i have the feeling that everyone would be very happy to see me sign .
everyone ... everyone but me .
so ... what can i do for you ?
there is nothing you can do for me , doctor .
i represent the ministry of the interior .
everybody at the ministry regrets seeing you here .
you are one of our best brain specialists .
just between us maybe i shouldn' t say it we don' t all agree with the drastic tactics that are removing our top specialists from their posts .
one can only be sorry about all this .
may i ?
please .
you had a very good position in geneva , and you came back to our country .
we very much appreciate your having returned , but your place is at the operating table .
i couldn' t agree more .
everybody agrees .
then ... tell me , doctor ... do you really think that communists should pluck out their own eyes ?
you , who have healed so many people ?
that wasn' t what i meant .
but that' s how everyone understood it .
and we can only regret it .
how can you let people think that you , a doctor , want to deprive human beings of their right to see ?
maybe someone inspired this article ?
no , no one .
did you know the publishers ?
no .
you never spoke ?
once , they asked me over to discuss the article .
who was it you talked to ?
one of the editors .
what was his name ?
i don' t remember .
i' ve no idea .
what did he look like ?
i can' t remember .
tell me the truth , doctor .
he was tall ... with ... short , blond hair .
a little stooped , hmm ?
perhaps .
and how did he react ?
what did he say exactly ?
he asked me to make some changes .
so ... you might have been manipulated , doctor .
used .
whether you meant to or not , your article contributed to the anti communist hysteria .
nobody requires a doctor to understand politics .
of course , we can' t allow a politically suspicious man to operate on brains .
we have here another declaration .
i would advise you to sign .
this temporary error ... due to bad influences from so called intellectuals ... doesn' t in any way put in doubt my faithfulness to the communist party or my admiration for the soviet union .
of course , doctor , it' s only a proposition , a first draft .
if there is something you want to change ... after all , it' s your statement .
just a paper to keep in their files .
it' s nothing .
just in case someone reproaches them for letting you work here .
good evening , excellency .
why do they call him excellency ?
he was an ambassador in vienna ... before .
give me a cognac .
are you 18 ?
yes .
may i see your identification card ?
give me a drink .
give me a drink .
all right .
you have beautiful legs !
i watched you in the street .
stay here .
i want to look at you .
i love you !
tsk , tsk , tsk .
madame .
you have no right to serve alcohol to minors .
that was lemonade .
do you think i did not see what else you put into his lemonade ?
what are you talking about ?
i' ve been watching you for some time now .
then be grateful you' re watching a beauty , and keep your mouth shut .
you stay out of this .
what business is it of yours ?
and what business is it of yours , my friend ?
well ...
thanks .
don' t mention it .
that man comes here all the time .
he' s ...
he' s terribly unpleasant .
promise me you won' t think about him anymore .
i promise .
i like hearing you make me promises .
what is a beautiful girl like you doing in this terrible part of prague ?
what are you doing here ?
i' m living here .
i' m an engineer .
i just stopped here by chance .
i live very near here .
you' re a doctor , aren' t you ?
yes .
may i see you for a moment ?
i have windows to do .
oh , don' t worry about it .
come .
come in .
don' t worry about the window .
i' il tell them all the work has been done .
a glass of wine ?
thank you .
that would be very nice .
sit down .
i' ve heard so much about you .
when i saw you , i said to myself ,
what a coincidence .
he' s the one who can help me .
of course , i' il pay for the consultation .
i' ve had a pain in my back for a few months , and i would like to get your opinion about it .
take off your clothes .
everything ?
everything .
it' s , uh ... here .
what' s the matter ?
tell me what' s wrong .
what' s wrong ?
you forgot to wash your hair .
what are you talking about , tereza ?
your hair smells of a
what ?
of another woman' s sex !
i thought you had come back here for me .
i did come back here for you , tereza .
then why do you keep seeing other women ?
i don' t know what to say to you .
i know , i know .
you' ve explained it a thousand times .
a thousand times .
there is love and there is sex , and sex is entertainment , like football .
i know it' s light .
i wish i could believe you , but ...
how can someone make love without being in love ?
i just don' t know .
let me try .
oh , no .
you' d reject me if i tried .
i wish i could be like you ... insensitive ... strong ...
strong .
oh , hello .
i just tried
come in .
it' s a very simple place .
i hope you don' t mind .
no , not at all .
all these books are yours ?
yes .
what do you want to drink ?
anything .
wine ?
no .
coffee ?
ok .
i' il go fix some .
shall i take your coat ?
yes .
sit down .
thank you .
i' m very glad you came here .
i didn' t want to come here .
of course not .
there is somebody here , behind that curtain .
you' re being silly .
draw aside the curtain .
i told you you' re being silly .
so why don' t you draw aside the curtain , please ?
look .
nothing .
and over here .
i can feel that you want it .
what are you looking at ?
but be careful .
it was very well set up a young , provocative drunkard , then the other one , the one who attacked you .
then the third one , who gained your confidence just because he took your side .
the engineer ?
the so called engineer .
why do you look afraid ?
you have nothing to be afraid of .
but i went to see him , at his place , with my dog and a friend .
he offered us some ... some coffee .
how do you know it was his place ?
they have a lot of places they can use .
pretty cheap place for an engineer .
you know what they do with foreign diplomats ?
a beautiful girl , an apartment , a hidden camera .
then they blackmail the poor man .
and he does what he is told to do .
that' s vienna in ' 61 .
that' s me there , just behind kennedy and khruschev .
i' m in the back .
you can hardly see me .
are you sure he was from the police ?
i' m not sure of anything .
anybody can be from the police .
maybe your engineer is a real engineer .
who knows ?
they know .
and now they have what they wanted .
now you are afraid .
tomas .
i don' t want to stay here .
i want to go away , to leave .
to leave ?
again ?
we left here once .
we were in switzerland .
then we left switzerland .
now you want to leave again .
why ?
i don' t understand .
prague has grown so ugly .
no .
i know there' s another reason .
please tell me .
i want to leave .
i want to leave .
they' ve taken our passports .
there' s nowhere we can go .
we can' t go anywhere .
maybe we can .
mephisto is big now .
look , look .
look , karenin .
mephisto' s here .
phooey .
karenin prefers mephisto to dogs .
she thinks other dogs are silly .
do you know why i love mephisto ?
because he' s very bright , but at the same time , he doesn' t know anything .
after all , he doesn' t know that life is impossible here now .
nothing left here .
the church is gone .
no place to drink beer now .
it' s good ... very good .
if you two ever change your mind ... it won' t be easy to leave .
we' il never leave .
can i help you ?
look at karenin .
i don' t like the way she' s running .
yes , you' re right .
karenin , come on .
come on .
come on , girl .
come on .
come on .
let' s have a look at her .
what is that ?
it' s from the vet .
it' s the result of the tests .
what did they say ?
cancer .
oh , look at that .
look at it .
oh , it smells so good .
look .
come on , karenin .
look , tereza loves it , too .
oh , look at that .
oh , she' s smiling .
oh , karenin , it' s so good to see you eat again .
i was forced to love my mother .
but not to love this dog .
you know , tomas ...
maybe ... maybe i love her more than i love you .
not more .
i mean in a better way .
i' m not jealous of her .
i don' t want her to be different .
i don' t ask her for anything back .
i don' t think we should wait .
if we do , she' il have to go through terrible pain .
yeah .
you should do it yourself .
yeah .
look .
she' s smiling .
just hold her and talk to her .
don' t be scared .
don' t be scared , karenin .
you won' t feel any pain there .
it' il be beautiful there .
you' il have cows to chase .
and mephisto will be there .
mephisto will be there .
tomas !
what happened ?
shoulder .
now , lie down .
lie down .
not this way .
come on !
turn around .
all right , let go .
let go !
hold that arm .
you' ve dislocated your shoulder , and i' m going to put it back for you .
it' s going to hurt .
you ready ?
and again .
one more time .
come on .
whew .
do you feel better ?
your wife is damn beautiful today .
you dumb idiot .
tereza is always pretty .
yes , i know , but especially today .
seeing you in this dress makes me want to dance with you .
yes !
let' s all go and dance !
sure , but where ?
i know where .
we can go to milos ' tavern .
it' s 40 kilometers away .
i' il drive .
i' il drink .
and we' il take you and mephisto , the dancing pig .
and all the women will faint when they get an eyeful of those two pigs walking in together .
haha !
let' s go !
no pigs allowed .
ah , come on !
he' s wearing a tie !
no .
everyone who comes here must order a drink .
only one ?
did you hear that , mephisto ?
wine for everybody and beer for him ...
a large one .
make it a pilsner .
when mephisto drink wine , he goes crazy .
there' s no girls for me ... except you , tereza .
tomas ...
no , no , i can' t drink .
i must not .
i' m driving .
ho ho ho !
driving .
listen .
why not spend the night here , you and tereza .
you take the truck tomorrow .
nice .
excuse me .
hey , sam .
i got a special delivery here for you , from europe .
i' il see you , sabina .
see you .
what is it ?
bad news ?
some friends died .
they were coming back from spending the night in some small hotel there , gone there to dance , and they ...
it was raining , and ... the brakes on their truck didn' t work .
they were killed instantly .
i was ...
i was their closest friend .
sorry .
damn shame .
come to our place for dinner tonight , if you feel up to it .
tomas ...
what are you thinking ?
i' m thinking how happy i am .
