4, 222 square feet , four floors . perfect .
courtyard in back , south facing garden .
perfect .
shouldn' t we wait for the car service ?
no , we' il sit in traffic forever .
is that the listing sheet ?
there isn' t one .
i heard about it this morning .
it' il be gone soon .
how many more ?
none .
you know the market is tight .
sarah , do you have to ride that here ?
mom , we' re in the street .
evan !
one day you will learn to respect people' s time , lydia .
you' il realize that the world does not stop and start at your convenience .
i' m so sorry .
i' m meeting arthur digby laurence in 26 minutes ... ... and if you think he' s the kind of man who tolerates tardiness ... ... you are sadly mistaken .
you' re a saint to wait for us .
thank you .
hello .
it' s kind of between a townhouse and a brownstone .
we call it a " townstone " .
built in 1879 , this is the middle of the house , the parlor floor .
here is the living room .
formal dining is in the back .
casual dining below on the kitchen floor ... ... which was renovated in ' 94 with all the expected amenities .
sarah .
there are two bedroom floors above .
my god , it' s amazing .
hey , kid .
no scooter .
i don' t have to tell you this amount of living space is uncommon in manhattan .
it' s got a yard .
sort of .
it is in a bit of disarray , but then again , 21 foot lot , 53 deep .
it allows for an expansive garden .
working elevator .
the previous owner was disabled the last years of his life .
highly unusual , the elevator .
you will not find this in 90 percent of brownstones .
perhaps it' s something of a fixer upper , but we anticipate enormous interest .
it' s a very emotional property .
shall we have a look at the rest ?
you should make an offer immediately .
can i see it first ?
there is nothing like this on the market right now .
you can' t move from greenwich to the upper west side ... ... and expect to still have a house , a yard and a dog and cat , but here it is .
it' s got everything you told me you wanted and more .
you' il have another family .
you could have two .
it' s a fortune .
mom , it' s not barneys .
you don' t have to pay the price on the tag .
he can afford it .
it would be so lovely if i could show the property before i leave .
hardwood floors throughout , as many as six working fireplaces .
this is the top floor .
two bedrooms .
one at either end .
they share one small bath .
originally , this would have been the servants ' quarters .
the previous owner kept a small nursing staff .
i don' t know if you have live in help .
no , it' s just the two of us .
third floor , spare bedroom , den , or what have you .
mr. pearlstine used this as an office .
he' s talking about sidney pearlstine , the financier .
may i ask what you do , mrs ....
altman .
actually , i' m going back to school .
columbia .
her husband' s in pharmaceuticals .
i didn' t realize you were stephan altman' s wife .
yes , until recently .
master bath .
pearlstine' s been in all the papers since he died .
his kids are suing each other over the estate .
he was a recluse .
rich , paranoid .
now they can' t find half his money .
i hardly see how gossip is germane to showing the property .
stop calling it " the property " .
it sounds ridiculous .
walk in closet .
could the little one please stop that ?
kid , no elevator !
and we emerge in the master suite .
that' s strange .
what ?
is this room smaller than it should be ?
you' re the first person to notice .
on caravan , no one from our office had the slightest idea .
it' s called a panic room .
what ?
a safe room .
a castle keep in medieval times .
i' ve read about these .
they' re in vogue in high end construction .
one can' t be too careful about home invasion .
this is perfect .
the alarm goes off in the middle of the night .
what will you do ?
call the police and wait till tuesday ?
traipse downstairs in your underthings to check it out ?
i think not .
concrete walls .
buried phone line , not connected to the house' s main line .
call the police , nobody can cut you off .
you have your own ventilation system .
a bank of surveillance monitors that covers nearly every corner of the house .
this whole thing makes me nervous .
why ?
ever read any poe ?
no , but i loved her last album .
what' s to keep somebody from prying open the door ?
steel .
thick steel .
very thick steel .
full battery backup , so even if the power' s out ... ... it' s still functional .
oh , my god .
old sidney didn' t miss a trick , did he ?
open it , please .
and with kids like he' s apparently got , no wonder he wanted a place to hide .
please open the door .
that is highly inappropriate .
open the door , please .
my room .
definitely my room .
this is really dangerous .
that door is a hazard .
not at all .
motion detector , like an elevator .
the door won' t close if it' s blocked .
there' s another one at your ankles .
it couldn' t be safer .
i know they' il take asking price .
it' s working .
i hooked up the phone !
good for you , mom .
hooked up a phone .
579 what ?
3000 .
patsy' s pizza . please hold .
hey .
enough .
mind the pizza ?
what do you mean ?
our first night .
i should' ve thought of something special .
i like pizza .
fuck him .
don' t .
fuck her , too .
i agree .
but don' t .
don' t you think this place has way too many stairs ?
you didn' t carry anything up them .
you never asked what i thought of this house .
i didn' t want you to tell me you hated it .
i liked our old house .
well , so did l .
you know what i was thinking ?
i was thinking we could stencil the whole bookcase .
we could cut the stencils , do it ourselves .
go ahead .
oh , damn .
i forgot to set up that tour of your new school .
dad already did it .
i' m going with him on sunday .
oh , yeah ?
so i' il take a cab and meet him there .
is that what he said ?
isn' t that what' s so great about manhattan ?
you don' t have to drive me everywhere ?
i' il ride with you .
why' d you bring me here if i can' t go anywhere on my own ?
that' s it .
i quit .
i' m not fighting with you till tomorrow .
come here .
it' s disgusting how much i love you .
tell me about it .
mom ?
yeah .
it' s too dark .
better ?
that' s better .

felony kidnapping .

you promise me , you promise your kids .
no family .
you' re right .
it' s all fucked up .
i fucked it up !

i just got to be honest with myself here .
i don' t need to be involved ... ... with anything so harrowing or perilous at this point in my life .
you' re giving up ?
hell , yes .
i don' t need the fucking aggravation .
i' il make an anonymous phone call .
they' il find the floor safe .
i' il inherit .

take it .
go out and get loaded .
wait a minute .

say that shit about the money again , babycakes .
when ?
before ?
yeah , before .
splitting the money in your head , you said you' d put away 800 or 900 grand .
what are you doing ?
that was after tax , which makes it more than a million and a half gross .
so now you' re a tax attorney .
i' m out of here .
wait a minute .
there' s sugar in everything .
places you' d never expect .
like ketchup .
where else ?
travel kit .
plus , you named eight people you got to split it with ... ... so that' s 10 or 12 million bucks in the safe .
a fuck up like you has got to get less than everybody else ... ... so now i don' t know what to think .
you' re adding up money you' il never touch , buddy .
how much is in there ?
mouthwash .
saccharin .
hey , i' m talking to you .
answer me .
fine .
there' s more .
and when were you going to tell us this minor economic detail ?
it doesn' t matter now .
it' s totally fucking moot !
why are we having this conversation ?
what were you thinking ?
how did you expect to get away with this ?
did you think that i' d open that safe ... ... and then me and raoul would wait while you picked out your share ?
what' s the matter with you ?
you got us into this mess , and you were going to fuck us ?
you got yourself into this .
you got the custody lawyers up your ass .
your eyes were huge when i told you about the gig ... ... so don' t play innocent .
things didn' t work out .
play past it .
mints ?
sugar free .
mints ?
sugar free .
i' m opening that safe .
you leave , you get nothing .
it' s looking doubtful there , big guy .
i will split the money with raoul .
but i don' t ever want to see you again .
cops show up on my doorstep , we will know who sent them ... ... and we will fucking find you .
i' il see you , burnham .
later , raoul .
