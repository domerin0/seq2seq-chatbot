miami pd has arrested this guy 1 2 times with no convictions .

this has got to be the worst , most emotional cop week of my life .
yeah , it' s been a little rough .
where were these bodies going ?
i don' t know .
it' s really strange .
all the john does we found out here are empty .
empty does .
fat does .
cut them open , took the organs out .
sewed them back up .
nice work .
the more you guys fuck up , the more we look like rock stars .
the van you was chasing is a transport for the city morgue .
the john does were being delivered to the university for medical research .
nice going .
i can' t believe you guys .
do you both wake up in the morning , call each other up ?
good morning , marcus .
morning , mike .
how you doing ?
a' ight .
so how are we gonna fuck up the captain' s life today ?
gee , i don' t know .
i don' t know .
ooh .
look , over there .
let' s kill three fat people ... ... and leave them on the street .
they were dead before we ran over them .
it doesn' t matter whether they were dead or not , goddamn it !
every time you leave a corpse on the street ... ... i have to get these forensic coroner guys to come to see what happened .
then i gotta get detectives .
see ?
they' re detecting shit .
then i gotta get these forensic guys to stick them back in the fucking bag !
jesus christ !
you guys , you' re like ...
you' re like a bunch of bloodsucking ticks ... ... draining the life' s blood out of this department .
whoosah .
damn the whoosah , captain .
did you just call me a tick ?
i was referring to him .
thought so .
these aren' t normal corpses .
if i threw you out of a speeding ice truck ... ... and then ran over your head , you wouldn' t be normal either .
think about this for a second .
these bodies have been emptied ... ... from a drug smuggler that just happens to own a mortuary .
i got a bunch of bodies waiting with plenty of room in them ... ... i could smuggle some shit .
johnny tapia has the perfect cover .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
johnny tapia ?
i want a warrant to go into his mortuaries immediately .
no warrant .
what ?
for what ?
for what ?
for a bunch of dead guys on their way to med research ?
no .
every time we go after him , he sues us and wins .
this shit stops now or they' il fire us , disband tnt ... ... and stick me in a fucking coffin .
this is over now !
what happened to " whatever it takes " ?
that was pre vehicular manslaughter .
not to mention johnny tapia ...
what the fuck is that ?
oh , shit .
shut up .
shut up .
shut up .
shut up .
this man has violated my rights !
who the fuck is that ?
running people over is not enough for you ?
now you' re into kidnapping ?
that man is a criminal .
okay ?
we busted him at the ...
excuse me , i have so much brass up my ass ... ... i could be playing " the star spangled banner .
i ain' t cut out for this , man .
come on , man .
i can' t do this with you right now .
i' m re evaluating what' s important .
about what ?
being a cop ?
no , about you being my partner .
is this about syd ?
god !
hey , marcus , man ...
that was messed up , but that ain' t what this is about , mike .
once we nail tapia , you and me , we' re over .
i already signed my transfer papers .
megan , what' s the name of this boy taking you to the movies ?
reggie .
daddy , please don' t embarrass me and ask him a lot of questions .
everybody knows you' re a cop , and it makes people nervous .
well , why nervous ?

it' s a delicate situation .
this is not just a situation .
this is my sister .
off the record , all state department agencies ... ... are using their back channel contacts for a diplomatic solution .

my brother , tito , lives in cuba .
he' s a little crazy , but he' s hooked up with the underground .
weapons , men , a safe house .
whatever we need .
you can forget about passports and all that stuff .
because if the cubans catch us , we' re all dead .
my brother tito' s in alpha 66 , the anti castro underground .
what does that have to do with tapia ?
everything .
tapia' s the biggest supplier of drug cash to castro .
so alpha 66 will be all over him .
brother , that is perfect .
he says he can get men on the tunnel right away .
let me holler at him .
tito , we need layout , security , the whole deal .

the bad news , everyone knows he uses the army like his bodyguards .
this is tapia' s compound .
cla hooked us up , huh ?
