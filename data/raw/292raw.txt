the thlrd wave
the hague , hoiland
europol the european union' s police authority
on the internationai scene , iike his compatriots before him
dag hammarskid , raoui wailenberg , olof palme
men who are aii symbols for strength , justice and integrity .
so it is my honour to introduce
the new head of the organized crime unit
superintendent seilberg of the gothenburg police .
thanks .
i' ve been a policeman aii my iife , working close to the street .
hopefuily that' s why i got the job .
so i' m painfuily aware that the new criminality , which is crossing
the borders , and destroying the fabric of society throughout europe
iies under the surface .
thus , the papers seldom write about it .
and what we don' t read in the papers ... doesn' t exist , right ?
what i am about to say has never been stated by a police authority .
i' m tired of being politicaily correct .
it' s too iate for that now .
the type of crime i speak of has hit european countries
in three different waves .
the first arrived over the iast decade , the second a bit iater , at
different times in different countries .
and the third wave ... is here now .
contrary to popular belief it' s not drugs
which turn over most dirty money .
drug dealing is risky .
and results in iong prison sentences .
smuggling people , however , results in short prison sentences .
so a huge industry can be built , employing many people
as the risks are so iow .
recently europoi exposed a transport company with over a thousand iorries
engaged in different forms of smuggling .
a thousand iorries , in just one company !
alcohoi and cigarette smuggling , trading in people
organized prostitution , eu related vat frauds , fiddling with subsidies .
organized crime is no doubt the iargest industry in europe .
its turnover is over a thousand biilions euros every year .
five times switzerland' s gnp !
dealing with this kind of money , it' s important that nothing goes wrong .
unfortunately these organized criminals coilaborate better
than both the police and governments
and they are more ruthless than their counterparts in north america .
they are not afraid of executing politicians , judges , prosecutors
women and children .
and where do aii these thousands of biilions euros go ?
they are re invested .
today miilions of companies
are owned or controiled by organized crime .
today anybody ...
you , for instance ... ... can go on the internet and with an ordinary credit card buy a shady bank
in a tax haven .
neither the police or tax authorities wiii be informed .
there are islands with more banks than p. o. boxes .
than inhabitants .
but it' s not only in tax havens that criminals own banks .
we know today that severai of europe' s oldest banks
are secretly owned by criminals .
the total figure is incredible .
we suspect that today more than 50 percent of aii banks and financial
institutions in europe are owned or controiled by organized crime .
a few years ago this figure applied to eastern europe .
now the figure there is over 85 per cent .
i' m talking about europe today .
and the figure is increasing iike an avalanche .
an entire continent is being stolen .
europoi is the only police authority in europe that has
the war against organized crime as its first and foremost priority .
this is a war we intend to win .
it' s a war we must win .
thanks .
london' s flnanclal dlstrlct
the man of the hour .
how did i do ?
you reaily dropped the bomb .
you think they got it ?
the reporters ?
yes .
they took you very seriously .

after september 11 , budget problems disappeared , hire whomever you iike .
dunkerque , the french west coast
remember , the police are there for the state and the public interest .
not for the individual .
thank you .
are you iistening ?
yes .
no , you aren' t .
yes , i am .
if i have a problem , or you , the police won' t solve it if
the solution goes against the state , but you won' t find that in any books .
i' m talking to you !
please , we' re on holiday .
no , you' re free from schooi to foilow your mom on her job .
and i' ve promised to help you with " today' s police and judiciary system " .
nothing you say is in the books .
so it won' t be on the test .
exactly !
then why iearn it ?
because the trick is to know , what other people think they know
but also know how things reaily are .
understand ?
shit ...

a. mnsdottr detective superintendent on duty
hi , it' s johan .
hi .
it' s been a while ...
did you hear about seilberg ?
yes .
it' s horrible !
can you speak ?
yes , why ?
this could be dangerous , but i trust you , anja .
what is it ?
promise , you won' t tell anyone .
it depends on what it is .
some people disappeared from the scene of the murder in the hague .
two kiilers and ... ... two others .
i need to know if europol , or any other police authority
knows who they were .
check with cld in stockholm .
heil , johan , was it ...
stop , don' t say anything .
l' ve sald nothing so far .
i' m afraid that if the killers learn his identity
they might go after his family .
you get it ?
yes , caii me back in a few minutes .
thanks .
bye .
according to the cld the dutch police have only identified one person .
a hit man , dressed as a cop , was kiiled in the restaurant .
a frenchman , jean monteux .
two other hit men , and a woman
and another man , have not been ldentifled , but are wanted .
kane' s iawyers .
i can' t help anymore without informing my coileagues .
just a minute , some iawyers are walking in to europol .
i' ii give you their names .
i need to know what they' re after .
if we go to the police there' s a risk that aii that we say
wiii end up with the kiilers ' iawyers who are at europoi right now .
they know who you are , but to get to you , they need to know who i am
and put pressure on me , perhaps by threatening you .
lawyers ?
how do you know aii this ?
anja .
so you' ve talked to the police ?
anja' s a friend .
she won' t talk .
she did to you ...
i' ii get the kiilers .
it' s to our advantage that they don' t know who i am .
johan , why did i push you into this ?
weil , i just can' t give up , can i ?
that' s what you' ve done for a year .
she' ii die if nobody helps her .
but you' re using her and your ex girlfriend at police hq
for revenge !
i don' t want you to , johan !
i' m pregnant .

through a new front , for iess money than the debts from the first one .
and now they' re roiling again .
i' ve seen three pass here now .
ok , is kane one of the owners ?
no , he arranges the transactions .
he gets the dirty money into iegitimate companies
on the stock exchange in london , and in new york .
how ?
correspondent banking .
he' s got 12 , maybe 13 , bank managers he works with , in as many countries
so the authorities don' t see any connection .
and tomorrow ... he' ii be in munich .
how do you know that ?
he' s just ieft the hospital .
if he doesn' t turn up , some people wiii get very angry .
who ?
i was to have dinner with some guys iast night .
nice businessmen ...
one owns " cuisine express " , the chain of restaurants in half of europe .
another owns one of the iargest chain store companies
and then there' s the guy , who is the reai owner of the iorries .
weil , that' s that ...
we' ii ieave the rentai car here .
and then what ?

62 meters , dead calm .
i know this security fiirm .
it' s one of the best in europe .
but it' s owned by harrows capital , which is owned by a trust in jersey
an invisible trust controiled by kane .
so these are his iackeys , his samurai .
they' re probably not aware of it .
you are vice president at his financiai institution , so you' re a iackey , too .
cut it out !
what ?
i checked my contracts from the fair , to see from whom i obtain orders .
there' s a company connected to the chain stores she talked about .
so i' ve been supported , and you
by the same bastards who are mixed up with those iorries .
yeah , it' s heil , but it' s reality !
face it , she' s been fucking brave .
