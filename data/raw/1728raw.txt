calling all cars ...
partridge " sighted around 23 : 00 , cite gagarine .
short hair , moustache ...
goatee beard .
carrying a sports bag and a military knapsack in green canvas covered in doodles .
like a student 20 years ago .
with all that , you can ' t miss him .
happy hunting and take care .
he knows we ' re onto him .
the destruction of the law courts proves we can strike at will .
no member of the system is safe .

and who are you ?
don' t get smart .
the name' s yvan .
how do i contact you ?
you don' t contact me .
i' il come by .

what the hell ?
i told you to split !
what' s wrong ?
cops are all over .
you got a fallback ?

i haven' t done anything .

do we have to stay much longer ?
you' il be fine with me .
i have to go .

i feel awful .

inspector ...
your husband' s more talkative .
we had a very interesting chat .
you' re free to go .
what did you tell him ?
nothing .
that we' d stayed in every night this week .
that you came straight home after school .
that we watched tv all night .
what you should' ve told him .
i had no reason to tell him anything .
you neither .
you' d still be there now .
as if i care !
they had us under watch .
is that normal ?
it wasn' t normal for you to be there one more day .
it wasn' t for you to talk .
it' s not your affair .
you have a kid now .
your choices are his affair .
he missed you .
he was confused .
what did you tell him ?
you were at your mother' s .
you lied to him .
i don' t want lies .
i' il tell him the truth .
you have no right .
some day , he' il find out .
someone will tell him , at school or football .
if we lied , he' il think i was guilty .
he' il feel guilty , too .
i don' t want him feeling guilty of anything .
i' ve done nothing wrong .
i' m not so sure about that .
i don' t care what you think .
come on ...
wake up !
look at me ...
you' re at home .
don' t be afraid ...
you' re at home now .
look at me ...
everything' s okay ...
c' mon , stand up .
on your feet ...
hold onto me ...

let me sleep .
no , you can' t sleep ...
help me , for christ' s sake .
keep going ...
walk !
don' t go to sleep ...
that' s right , keep your eyes open .
that' s good ...
can you see me ?
can you hear me ?
sit down but don' t go to sleep .
hold on ...
look at me ...
now , talk ...
what' s your name ?
tell me your name .
can you remember ?
see what he helped me avoid ?
who ?
my man .
he always gave me all the dope i needed .
since i met him , i never went cold turkey .
not once .
i' d forgotten .
15 years since i had to buy my own dope .
and this is the result .
he won' t get any more ?
why ?
do you know why ?
can you get me some ?
c' mon , help me .
what' s your name ?
pierre .
thank you , pierre .
my saviour .
go out first and cross the road so i can see you .
if the coast is clear , fine .
if there' s anything unusual , head one way then double back , neither fast nor slow , just walking normally .
okay ?
meet you at 2 in the car park .
i' il probably be driving an orange audi .
very discreet .
watch how you go , matador .
hi there .
my meeting ?
tonight , 1 1 pm .
place du barlet .
will jaquillat be there ?
no , i will .
you pick me up and we go together .
tell me where to save time .
i don' t know where it is .
he' il guide us on my mobile .
just give it to me .
i can' t trust you with my mobile !
if you don' t do exactly as he said , no deal .
ok , we do it his way .
you got any dope ?
don' t pull a gun on me , i won' t have any for a while .
he didn' t like me knowing his name .
you got me in the shit , no mistake .
don' t worry , in 3 days he' il forget .
see you tonight .
shit !
you' re fucking crazy .
sorry .
celebrating ?
my release .
they grilled me all last night .
they beat you up ?
' course not .
i didn' t talk .
anyway , you know nothing .
they stopped tailing you .
did you know ?
it shows they believed you .
see that ?
your pupils got behind you .
yes , they' re great .
try to get them to move .
encourage them .
pick out the good ones , i' il train them up .
are you kidding ?
i' m not dragging my kids into all your crap .
it wasn' t crap then .
well , now , i' ve changed my mind .
jean jean' s dead .
did you know ?
why didn' t you say ?
i thought you didn' t care .
you know he was shot in the back ?
does it matter ?
you signed the geneva convention ?
are you saying it wasn' t your fault ?
if that' s why you' re here , i think i got the message .
it' s not that .
i know what i have to do .
i need a hand tonight .
it' s important .
you won' t be at risk .
it' s just back up .
i said no .
i' m not interested .
the world' s changed in 20 years .
maybe we were right but it' s over .
nothing has changed .
the same oppressors , same oppressed .
the world hasn' t changed .
you have changed .
be strong , we can' t give up now .
i' m not going anywhere with you .
never will .
i won' t help you , won' t hide you , won' t write a tract .
don' t even ask .
don' t ask me for anything .
i' m all alone , jeanne .
alone , they' il kill me .
why don' t you go ?
i' il get you to ltaly .
we can leave right now .
i' il do that , nothing else .
what is there for me in ltaly ?
save your skin , that' s the only thing worthwhile .
life' s worth nothing .
it' s what you do with it .
save your slogans for someone else .
i won' t come .
i' m out of it .
it' s none of my business .
you believe that ?
i' m meeting the shit who gave us away .
he didn' t give me away .
he didn' t know you .
and those who did kept their mouths shut .
wanna know what they did to jean jean ?
and andre ?
and me ?
do you ?
why not ?
none of your business ?
if we' d talked , you wouldn' t have a kid to raise .
don' t forget it .
you' il be there tonight .
for jean jean and andre .
you owe them .
jean jean' s dead .
andre' s a thug .
prison is the only place for him .
take that back immediately .
i take back what i said .
i apologize .
say you don' t really think that .
i don' t really think that .
that' s okay .
i' il forget what you said .
i' il pick you up at 10 : 45 .
it' s my friend cecile' s .
i said i' d met a guy .
you' il be safe here .
the car' s yours ?
no , it' s hers .
i' m going to need one with valid documents .
i have to get it back to her today .
no sweat , i' il find one .
i' il rent you one , if you like .
that' s an idea .
i' il take care of it .
what do you think ?
it' s perfect .
don' t lose it .
i give hers back tonight .
don' t worry .
where is he ?
let me explain .
no point .
i know what' s going on .
you' ve got it wrong .
i don' t think i have .
alain ...
that' s enough .
i know you' re here .
i' m warning you .
i won' t budge until i' ve seen you .
don' t force me to look in the closet .
you must be cecile .
who are you ?
pierre .
you didn' t say he was moving in .
it' s temporary .
get out .
listen ...
get out right now !
but he can' t .
he' s nowhere else to go .
he has no job , no welfare , nothing .
for months , he' s had to beg .
tell that to pascal .
i' m sure he' il be delighted to offer him a bed .
now , out !
both of you .
you can' t do this .
you' il use force ?
come on .
what are we gonna do ?
nothing .
you did the right thing .
stay calm .
she' il come to us .
i' m sorry .
i was a little ...
you can stay here , of course .
it' s ok , we' il look after you .
what time you got ?
ten to .
me , too .
bang on time .
i' il go .
okay .
who was it ?
it' s muriel .
she' s run away again .
i' m not that stupid .
where are you going ?
to fetch her .
i' il make up a bed .
no , i' il take her home .
don' t wait up , i' il be some time .
drive .
what have you done ?
you' il see in the paper .
you' re okay .
you didn' t get hit .
whose blood is it ?
don' t ask .
you killed him ?
i' m going .
no , stay put .
there' s no point me staying .
maybe not .
i need to think .
just do what i say .
steer clear of rue de la roche ...
i' il take care of the car .
make for ltaly .
good luck .
you can go .
how did you end up here ?
owner' s a well wisher .
that' s not true .
i know who the owner is .
she' s a colleague of mine .
it' s not her style .
i know she' s a colleague .
what do you think ?
the group stops at those you know ?
there' s many more you don' t know .
we even have a mole in the police .
he keeps me informed .
tomorrow , i' il have a new car and then i' il blow up police hq .
we' ve never been stronger .
the proletariat knows they' il always be exploited .
people are sick of it .
they want change .
and it will change .
they lay off 1, 000 workers , we kill one of the bosses .
redundancy will become rarer .
we were 15 years too early but now the masses are ready .
there are no masses .
that' s your problem .
you live in a world of individuals and individualism .
go see where jean jean' s mum lives .
the same problems as masses of others .
is her future brighter with jean jean dead ?
she knows why .
she' s proud of him .
i' m glad .
can the same be said of your victims ?
they were class enemies .
3 firemen in chambery , a retired railworker in lyon , 2 bank clerks in vizille .
they' re irrelevant !
not to me !
they got in the way , okay ?
no , not okay .
i want to know why they died .
what for ?
i want you to tell me .
get out .
you' re on your own .
you' il get yourself shot , all for nothing .
fuck off !
i was scared , francis .
it' s all over .
you' re safe now .
come on ...
where is he ?
he killed again tonight .
it wasn' t him .
were you there ?
you don' t know then .
he denied it .
the radio said otherwise .
the radio always takes the cops ' side when the cops kill someone .
he' s crazy .
completely crazy .
he' s going to die and he' s scared .
where is he ?
no way .
where' s my daughter ?
you startled me .
where' s my daughter ?
i don' t know .
she stole my car .
i know it was to come here .
where is she ?
i haven' t seen anyone , i swear .
i don' t believe you .
i know who you are .
you' re not homeless .
you were never agnes' s lover .
you' re her dealer .
pretty amazed , huh ?
i know everything .
i know you' re blackmailing pascal .
did he tell you ?
mind your own business .
i haven' t told him .
i wouldn' t want him to beat you up .
even so ...
that' s the least you deserve .
i' d be a tougher match than agnes .
what are you saying ?
he beats her .
you never noticed how violent he is ?
you didn' t wonder why she wore shades yesterday ?
she should have said .
it' s not easy to talk about .
he' d better not see me .
come with me , i' m scared .
i' il be watching .
keep nice and composed .
he' s not here .
it' s empty .
i got it all wrong .
let' s go .
having problems ?
is that you ?
don' t be stupid .
alone ?
what do you want ?
i asked if you are alone .
okay , let' s check .
hands in your pockets !
cool it .
i' il wait for jeanne .
make me some food .
shut up !
not a word out of you !
for christ' s sake , what do you want ?
do you want money ?
a car ?
want me to get you across ?
in 2 hours , we can be in ltaly .
we' il play it your way but my boy will be home soon .
i prefer to wait for him .
i' ve nothing against you .
but try that again and i won' t think twice .
get cleaned up and we' il tidy the house .
hurry , they' re here .
i' il keep the gun out of sight for the kid but don' t try anything .
hello , mister .
hello , young man .
did you cut yourself , dad ?
go play in your room .
get out !
calm down .
shut up !
he' s right .
calm down .
you can' t stay .
' course not .
we' re leaving together in your car .
we won' t make it .
there are roadblocks all over .
they stop you ?
i was with my son .
never .
you hear me ?
never .
think it over .
either we go together , with me under a blanket and the kid in the back , and in 10 minutes it' s all over .
or i shoot you both and take the kid .
you wouldn' t .
you' d bet your life on it ?
you' re wrong .
more ?
where do i take you ?
i' il tell you .
get up .
move to one side .
that' il do .
why are you slowing down ?
there' s a roadblock .
where are we ?
boulevard mendes france .
be very careful what you do .
i swear i won' t try anything .
promise you won' t hurt the boy .
i can' t speak for the cops .
what' s going on ?
that' s fine .
we' re through .
take rue de sapporo .
we' re on it .
all the way to the end and stop .
you see rue d' lnnsbruck ?
any cops around ?
okay , i' m gone .
what the hell ?
don' t panic , it' s the kids ' safety .
you can relax .
you' il never see me again .
okay ?
i' il be right back .
what do you want ?
can i come in ?
i know where he is .
i' m just waiting for the boys .
no , don' t worry .
there' s nothing more to fear .
yes , sweetheart .
big kiss .
i love you .
