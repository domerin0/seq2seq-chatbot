this is where i live with my family .
my dad built the house , and it' s my job to keep up the repairs .

she used to manage the elementary school cafeteria over in motley , until it burned down last year .
my other sister , ellen , just turned 15 .
she got her braces off .
for days , she' s been walking around going , " ooh , ahh , " like she can' t believe the feel of teeth .
i got another brother , larry , but he got away .
and then there' s momma , who , in her day , was the prettiest girl in these parts .
ever since our dad was hung out to dry 17 years ago , momma' s had her hands full .
you see , with momma , there' s no nice way to break it to you .
she hasn' t left the house in over 7 years .

huh ?
you don' t have anything to do .

sure , he does .
no , i don' t .
yes , you do .
i' m almost 16 , and i got pages of ideas .
she designed a cake .
you haven' t done anything .
" stop it , ellen .
can i be excused ?
he never does anything !
please , can' t we do something as a family ?
can i please be excused ?
" we' re planning this as a family .
" it' s my party , though !
it' il be an exact copy ... of the original they built in boone .
really ?
" which is no big deal , " because all burger barns are built identical .
they' re prefabricated .
they just ship ' em out .
it' s so efficient , it' s amazing .
in the matter of a couple days , there can be a whole new restaurant there .
i was driving past the building site today .
you know , it' s going up ... right down the road from foodland .
the general manager was there , so i says , " can i fill out an application ?
he said , " you bet you can .
so i did , and it looks really good .
i might be wearing one of them uniforms , flipping some burgers , salting some fries .
you never know .
it could be the best thing that ever happened to me .
hey !
get out of there !
i saw her !
i saw her !
that wasn' t nice .
what ?
what' d i do ?
you know what you did .
that' s your mother in there .
your mother .
i know .
i don' t get you , man .
i just don' t get it .
let' s go , buddy .
ok .
come on .
gilbert , run now !
run !
hey , bye bye , momma .
bye bye .
bye , you guys .
move , baby .
gilbert , you' re shrinking .
shrinking , shrinking , shrinking , shrinking , shrinking .
i' m not tired yet , gilbert .
you got to go to sleep , ok ?
ok .
goodbye .
it' s not goodbye , it' s goodnight .
yeah .
goodbye is for when you' re going away , and we' re not going anywhere , are we ?
i know that .
jeez , i know that , gilbert .
see you tomorrow .
we' re not going anywhere .
goodbye .
arnie .
you got to work later ?
yeah , i do .
i got to come back .
how' s momma ?
she' s fat .
come on , man .
she' s not all that big , gilbert .
what ?
i saw a guy at the state fair ... who was ... a little bit bigger .
a little bit bigger ?
she' s not the biggest i' ve ever seen .
tucker , she' s a whale .
take her out for a walk .
take her out for a jog .
hey , bobby .
bobby .
give her a chance .
hi , guys .
how' s business ?
oh , not good .
hey !
nobody' s dying .
there' s a ladder .
there' s a clear corporate ladder .
that' s good .
i mean , this is good .
that' s a good thing for you to do .
if you' d give it a chance ...
i just was saying ... that it wasn' t something i should be doing .
they use canola oil , ok ?
you know what canola oil is ?
probably don' t even sell it at lamson' s grocery .
it' s cutting edge .
it creates a crispier french fry ... and a more unique product .
forget wendy' s , forget burger king , forget mcdonald' s .
that' s , like , old hat .
burger barn is cutting edge .
i could really stand behind it .
it' s an innovative place .
they created the salad bar , which is now mimicked by every single fast food chain in america .
they came up with that .
15 different toppings for each salad ... and two kinds of lettuce , and it' s all that you care to eat .
you either go from clerk to fry cook ... to cook to assistant manager , or you go from clerk to cashier captain to assistant manager .
and then from assistant manager , you go to manager and then regional manager and then ...
" look at the little fellas .
" you mean my hoppers ?
let' s try this .
for my friend .
there you go , my boy .
what do you say , arnie ?
uh ... thank you .
thank you .

he' s not sorry .
we' re not sorry .
don' t be sorry .
i' m not sorry .
if we' re having people come that early , we should have some appetizers .
that' d be good .
you know those little vienna sausage things ?
you use grapejelly and ketchup for a sauce .
" i was thinking ...
i want hot dogs , mom .
you know , like those hawaiian appetizers .
you get pineapple chunks out of the can ... and wrap them with bacon and put toothpicks through them .
how do you cook the bacon ?
in the oven on a pan .
but the bacon won' t be crisp ... if you bake it in the oven on a sheet .
" yes , it will .
and nobody wants greasy , floppy bacon .
momma , i want hot dogs !
we' re going to have hot dogs , honey .
i promise we' re going to have hot dogs .
" i want hot dogs !
every party that i' ve been to ...
" ellen .
ellen .

2 x 10s and the 2 x 12s , and the space between ' em here ... is ... should ... they' re right now at 2 feet , and this should be 16 inches .
that' s just standard .
see this here , flat flooring ?
flat flooring' s , like , once the wood gets old , you' il just fall right through it .
yeah , i guess daddy wasn' t much of a carpenter .
hey , gilbert , why did he use 2 x 6s instead of ...
tucker .
what ?
shh .
keep it down .
oh , sorry .

" you' re telling me later .
i' il tell you everything later .
look at those guys out there .
they' re laughing .
they' re all happy ... and waving to their friends .
but the next day ... and this is the thing that they don' t know ... they could be ... lying on the slab .
it' s kind of , uh , harsh ... but it' s kind of fun , too .
do you ever , um ...
what ?
um ... you know .
be tempted , like ... well , fool around with the bodies ?
oh !
no , i always wanted to ask .
i' m sorry if it makes you uncomfortable .
no , no .
people are very curious about that .
the worst thing that we do is we take the bodies , the grotesque ones , the really , really ugly ones ...
we make jokes about them , you know , harmless jokes , very harmless jokes , but we come up with some ... some very good , good jokes ... about them , my father and me .
but , you know , they' re dead , and , uh , nobody can see that .
nobody hears anything .
hi , boys .

isn' t she beautiful ?
i' m sorry .
