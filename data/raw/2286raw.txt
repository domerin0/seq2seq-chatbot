an hour after death ; the soul can be seen .
must be an hour by now ...
are the new planes here ?
we were outnumbered eight to one .
are our boys still advancing ?
the ximenes brigade is waiting for the bridge to be blown up .
lf only we had those new gun sights ...
escaton ; pinares ; navas and other villages rose up last night .
how far up ?
up to linas .
franco' s reinforcements can only come through saragossa .
our men will attack after the bridge has been blown up .
but how can we if we' re outnumbered eight to one ?
we' re glad to see you back .
hello .
time this thing was replaced !
yes ; hq .
yes ; sir .
you can' t go ; munoz .
too bad we hadn' t already gone !
we haven' t enough planes to let them shoot us down as they please .
it' s impossible !
it all depends on the bridge ; now .
there are plenty of comrades beyond the bridge .
even in town ?
especially in town .
ours ?
yes .
they must be near the river .
they' re already there .
the bridge at all costs " .
everything depends on linas .
we regained control of the village last night .
let' s hope we keep it !
we' re ok if just the police are watching the bridge .
otherwise ...
ls the bridge mined ?
yes ; but if franco' s men make it to linas ...
their army will defend the bridge and we' il be in trouble .
there aren' t enough of us .
we need trusty comrades .
what do you mean by " trusty " ?
reliable .
got many weapons ?
one automatic rifle .
some dynamite .
more out of town .
and in linas ?
one moment ...
gonzalez !
how many weapons do we have in linas ?
two combat rifles .
some hunting rifles ...
not much .
a little dynamite .
i taught them how to use it ; but they' re inexperienced .
take them the dynamite you have .
ls there another way than through the old gate ?
we' d be under enemy fire for 400 meters .
just this ?
not even 20 bullets per person .
we' il have more .
first ; we go through the old gate .
lmpossible to get out any other way .
what about the guards ?
eliminate them .
once outside ; get to the garage .
there are at least 2 cars .
then ; juan' s friends and i will take care of the bridge .
gonzalez and all the others ...
will take the dynamite to linas and do what they can . having spotted franco' s airfield , comes looking for a guide
who' il take him through the enemy lines .
popular front commlttee
you' re too stubborn !
explain .
mum' s the word " .
well then ?
what do we do with the wounded ?
take them to my school .
jos ' s right .
we' ve done enough talking .
for 9 days he watched franco' s airfield being built .
they plan on using the road ; too .
he saw the planes arrive ...
you saw them ?
me ; and the others .
of course !
that' s not the problem .
we heard the republican soldiers were here ... and there' s only you .
i' ve got to cross the lines
and join the army .
it' s not that easy .
tell us where the planes are .
we could send some men with you .
at this rate ; we' il be busier here ...
one field looks like any other ...
don' t be so sure ...
you have to recognize it and point it out ... to the pilots .
i should' ve left already .
the flock is fleeing franco' s machine guns .
a dozen loyal comrades will leave with you .
one of you will make it through .
you go and get them .
we' il all go .
take five .
the others will follow on .
one of us has to make it .
i' il go alone with him .
got any bikes ?
just two .
use them while you can .
the others can walk .
round up the comrades .
revolver ?
no thanks .
that' s all i need .
you have to hold the pass at any price .
our men are weary .
men from the town are coming with guns .
to the gate !
you two stay with the wounded .
the rest ; to the gate !
a cannon !
who knows about cannons ?
varga ; didn' t you serve in morocco ?
i don' t know how to use them .
how fast can the 75 mm . fire ?
1 5 shots per minute .
ln theory ...
every 4 seconds .
suppose we go the other way ?
we must go this way .
the other way' s blocked !
we need a car .
i saw one in mostoles street .
you can drive ; come with me .
you lot go round ...
wait over there and when we' re at the cannon ;
make your move !
can you do it ?
yes .
lf you crash into something sideways ; you don' t necessarily die .
and you miss the cannon .
you don' t necessarily die head on either .
the republicans find a car outside the town .
they arrive at linas to help the peasants who are fighting to keep franco' s men off the bridge .
how many rifles ?
200 kilos of dynamite ; and our men have reached the river .
how many rifles ?
200 kilos of dynamite ; i said !
what use is that ?
we' ve nothing to load it in .
we had nothing in asturias ; but we managed .
you' ve no rifles !
us and anyone who has no family will hold the pass as long as we can with our hunting rifles .
that' s all we can do .
we need more men for the wounded !
the stretcher bearers are tired out .
there are no paths on either side .
we' il have to go on foot .
on the right ; the mountain ... on the left ; the ravine .
does the route go along the hillside ?
climbing hard ?
will franco' s men cross there ?
they can' t do otherwise .
we ain' t doomed yet !
nor are the men at the bridge .
other than you ; who do the men respect the most ?
the school master .
you go with varga .
the rest of you ; search the houses and bring anything we can use to put the dynamite in .
ls there any clay ?
more than rifles .
varga ; don' t forget the cooking pots .
with some clay on ; they' il do .
bring back some clay .
fermin will .
two men are to go with the teacher .
the women can carry the things .
the rest of us will load up .
we' ve got the fuses and primers .
quiet ; everybody !
it rolls .
not straight ; it doesn' t .
that' s not strong enough .
ok .
are there any more ?
four more .
get them ; and tell everyone to bring what they can .
this is strong .
it' s not strong enough .
we need iron .
we can use these .
want bottles ?
we used bottles in asturias .
no ; we' ve got something better than that .
we' il add fuses and make grenades .
that' s great !
fantastic !
where do we put the fuses ?
there' s a hole already .
does it roll ?
lf we put wheels on !
find a wheelbarrow .
what do you want to do with these ?
when it explodes ; it' s dangerous .
let' s hope they get through to the pilots ...
armed with these odd containers ... the peasants fought franco' s men and kept them from reaching the bridge , their only means of communication with the rear .
captain ; weren' t you with richthofen' s squadron ?
22 allied planes .
that' s official .
we need real technicians .
when was the last time you flew ?
1 91 8 .
how long do you need to be able to fly again ?
a couple of hours ; i reckon .
have you been working in aviation ?
lately ; i' ve been working in the mines .
to think ; maybe some of them fought against him at verdun .
he could damn well land on the shooting range !
which was your party ?
none .
always independent !
what about you ; munoz ?
socialist ?
above all ; i was a pacifist .
ls that why you fly so low ?
you' ve got used to the danger ?
perhaps .
ln the socialist party ; we knew full well the moors were helping franco .
and we wondered ... what the arab workers thought .
i came over as soon as i could .
i came because i was bored .
the targets are ready .
it' s flying at least .
it' s landing .
civilian planes aren' t used in wartime ; so we may as well ...
he' s wide .
he' il do it again !
i' m sorry .
i told you i' d need a couple of hours ' practice .
i' ve spent too long in the mines .
my sight' s not as good as it was .
we' il see ...
no need .
i refuse to fly again .
get me into the militia .
please ...
someone who shoots like that is good enough for the militia .
it' s a static target .
allow me .
this i can still do .
they arrive at the last village held by franco' s men .
they must find out how to cross the lines and reach the republicans ' airfield .
we' re going into that caf .
where are you going ? " ...
i' m sure the lines aren' t far .
we' ve done nothing .
we took the wrong road .
they won' t believe us .
they' il nab us .
what about the planes during this time ?
8 days ago ; that caf was ours .
it' s open .
we' ve just gone past it .
how will he know us ?
coffee with brandy .
no sugar .
it' il come soon .
two cups of coffee .
no sugar .
ln that case ... coffee with brandy .
okay .
it' il come soon .
okay .
we want a word with you .
armed ?
a little .
the garden' s out back .
leave that cat alone !
where can the lines be crossed ?
the street you came from ...
who sends you ?
pablo ; in linas .
at the end of the street ; you turn and ...
thanks for coming .
don' t mention it .
it' s not for you or for me .
where are the planes ?
ln the woods .
down tracks like these .
but further in .
it' s a big wood .
what' s the airfield like ?
where they take off ; you mean ?
it' s not like this one .
narrower ?
the soldiers are working on it non stop .
they' re making it bigger .
what orientation ?
ln the direction of the east wind .
so the woods are to the west of the field .
are you sure ?
1 00 % sure .
remember the direction the wind came from yesterday ?
north .
it felt like rain .
it' s the same here .
they' il have trouble taking off .
how many planes ?
i counted six small ones .
others claim to have seen more .
at least six big ones .
maybe there' s more .
where did you see them ?
i couldn' t tell you .
take me in your machine and i' il show you .
just like that !
have you ever flown before ?
won' t you be scared ?
will you recognize the airfield ?
i' ve lived in the village 28 years .
lf you show me the saragossa road ...
i can show you the airfield .
go and get some rest .
you' il need it .
phone the air office ; the war office ... whatever it takes .
ask for cars for the night take off .
we don' t have a single headlight .
i hope they do !
shut up !
what about the peasant ?
he knows where franco' s secret airfield is .
so ... tonight ?
you are appointed political commissary .
i' il announce it at tomorrow' s meeting .
do you know who i am ?
my father is one of the fascist leaders ...
... in my country .
i know that .
i accept .
you take the second plane .
we can have a try at night .
does the peasant really know where the airfield is ?
maybe .
ln this part of the world ; there' s no room for error .
the airfield is here .
we' re here .
that' s why they blocked the bridge !
they can' t keep watch at night .
we have to start with the airfield .
at dawn .
lf we destroy it ; they' il only be able to warn their bases to the south .
we' il be on the bridge before then .
after ...
captain !
what ?
there' s not a car anywhere !
the war office have had 7 requests already .
but for different reasons .
it' s crucial .
a surprise bombing of an enemy airfield is stupid if it' s not done at night .
and if they attack ...
let' s hope for clouds !
as for the cars ; we' il have to ask the villagers .
are the two crews ready ?
only two ?
come and see ; political commissary !
that' s the one they' re repairing ?
what about the reserve ?
we' ve been expecting the engines for 6 months .
so tonight ; zero fighter planes ?
no ; they won' t be back from madrid .
the main thing is to find some headlights .
let' s go get the cars .
the one we shot down yesterday .
they' ve improved them .
look at their machine gun .
but we still have a chance !
hurry up !
to take off at night , the two men ask the peasants to lend them cars , so they can light up the airfield with their headlights .
i' m in charge of the airfield .
i need some cars .
we' re leaving tonight and i' ve no lights .
we need car headlights .
and i don' t have any cars .
nor does the war office .
you do have cars .
3 cars and 2 trucks .
you need 1 2 cars !
it' s a matter of life and death for our comrades up there .
we can' t loan you the cars without our men .
they' ve already worked 1 5 hours today .
our mechanics will drive .
the drivers can sleep in the cars .
when do you want them ?
3 o' clock at the latest .
these cars and a few fires should do the trick .
we' d crash into the orange trees !
we' il do what we can .
three at least ; i promise .
and more if possible .
we still have to ensure supplies get through .
see if you can sort it out with the other villages .
aviation .
i understand your needs ; but a promise is a promise ; and i can' t .
we' il do the best we can ; like the others .
3 cars !
you' re the last people we can ask .
we' il do our best .
let' s go ; sleepyhead !
how many cars ?
five .
let' s hope there' il be more .
who are they ?
volunteers .
what for ?
to carry the supplies .
where are the trucks ?
they' re at the airfield to help you out .
and he just puffs away in peace !
you' re back ; captain .
how many cars ?
they' re coming .
i told them where to put them .
when the whistle blows ; they' il turn on their lights .
we' il all crash into the orange trees ...
twelve ?
very good .
we' il come out at 5 o' clock .
tell your comrades not to be scared .
we won' t crash into them .
ls there no other landmark than teruel ?
after that ; follow the saragossa road up to the peasant' s village .
beyond silos .
i hope he recognizes it .
we' il go straight to the bridge .
it' il be daylight .
too late for them .
we' re 400 meters off course .
presently ; we' il be going through clouds .
land !
ours ?
no ... theirs .
we must be over teruel .
there' il be gaps in the clouds .
make a turn now .
ls that teruel ?
that' s teruel ?
does he recognize it ?
there' s the saragossa road !
go up again !
bearing 27 4 .
their field must be 20 kms . from here .
5 minutes .
lf we don' t find it right away ... we' il get caught by their fighters .
the clouds are hiding us .
looks like teruel hasn' t spotted us yet .
they haven' t fired .
what' s he up to ?
doesn' t he recognize it ?
lf he doesn' t spot it ; what then ?
must be around here .
dive !
there are mountains !
not that way .
go on .
the clouds are getting lower .
i' m going down to 200 meters .
lf there are any mountains ; we' il be in trouble .
do i turn ?
no time .
follow the road !
ls that your village ?
there' s the saragossa road .
where' s the landing field ?
lower !
there it is !
the fighters are coming !
open fire on the bunker !
ready ?
ready !
climb !
our bombs might damage us as they explode .
altimeter 300 ?
300 .
take aim .
their fighters aren' t far now .
and us ; with our 1 91 3 machine guns !
it' s migration time .
boys ; the captain' s coming back !
how about that for a nice piece of work !
all thanks to our mascot !
hey ; catch this !
too far for the vertical ; pujol .
turn ; for chrissakes !
dive !
don' t worry ; others will be coming .
they' re back !
put a tourniquet on .
rear turret ; they' re coming back !
they' re flying away !
our fighters are coming .
we' re falling ...
only one engine left .
suppose we glide ?
pujol ... are you wounded ?
climb !
the mountain !
pull up !
shut your face !
the first plane is back at base .
the captain , informed by telephone that a plane has crashed in the hills ; goes to rescue his men .
they' re not there .
the comrade says they crashed higher up .
ln the mountains .
higher up ; there' s only valdelinares .
shall i call ?
bullets ?
the man who was here before was one of us .
on july 1 8th ; he phoned madrid and ...
first of all ; they spoke of mora hospital .
no one at the town hospital .
no one at the school hospital .
then ; linares .
no one there either .
now ; higher up ; in the mountains ...
they called mora to ask for a doctor for the wounded pilots ; so maybe ...
he ; too ; wants to be a pilot !
it' s one of the pilots .
it' s you ; pujol ?
who' s dead ?
wounded ?
who' s able to walk ?
yes .
on mules .
are they taking care of you ?
they' re doing their best .
let me talk to the doctor .
can you make up some stretchers ?
i' il bring some .
start going down .
i' il wait for the ambulance .
it' il go as high up as it can .
take down the dead too .
aren' t the pilots with you ?
no ; they' re going down the ravine .
phone them and tell them .
i must stay here .
lf i could go ; i would .
what use would you be ?
i' m going !
me too .
to carry stretchers ?
you can hardly stand !
i' il do what i can .
you' il have to help .
what can you do for the dead ?
be grateful to him .
can you see ?
a little .
i can see you .
want anything ?
i want her to go to hell with her broth !
where' s the ambulance ?
it' il take us a good hour to get down .
got a mirror ?
the one with the face wound mustn' t drink .
but i used our last chicken ...
never mind .
my son' s at the front ; too .
we' re from val de san garcia .
what can we do ?
talk to the doctor .
you mustn' t let him drink ; even if he asks you to .
so you shot down their plane ?
i' il never have a chance to do it again .
of course you will .
the ambulance is here .
you and i know that' s not true .
with a bullet in the stomach ; i' ve got 3 hours .
look at the time .
give me my flying suit .
ask the doctor for his flying suit .
it' s all the same to me ...
i could' ve fallen ill and died in the mines .
you know ... during the fight ; they all held up their mascots ; like kids .
i looked at them .
tell them i never had contempt for them .
please ...
the way i looked at them embarrassed them .
it' s not that i despised them ... but that i understood i was old .
the suits are at the town hall .
what do you want ?
maybe i can get it for you .
a revolver .
i' ve had my time .
i don' t need any longer .
not till you' ve seen the doctor .
not till i' ve seen the doctor ...
where are they from ?
one' s german ; the other' s french ...
and that one ?
spanish .
and that one ?
an arab .

captain ; weren' t you with richthofen' s squadron ?
22 allied planes .
that' s official .
we need real technicians .
when was the last time you flew ?
1 91 8 .
how long do you need to be able to fly again ?
a couple of hours ; i reckon .
have you been working in aviation ?
lately ; i' ve been working in the mines .
to think ; maybe some of them fought against him at verdun .
he could damn well land on the shooting range !
which was your party ?
none .
always independent !
what about you ; munoz ?
socialist ?
above all ; i was a pacifist .
ls that why you fly so low ?
you' ve got used to the danger ?
perhaps .
ln the socialist party ; we knew full well the moors were helping franco .
and we wondered ... what the arab workers thought .
i came over as soon as i could .
i came because i was bored .
the targets are ready .
it' s flying at least .
it' s landing .
civilian planes aren' t used in wartime ; so we may as well ...
he' s wide .
he' il do it again !
i' m sorry .
i told you i' d need a couple of hours ' practice .
i' ve spent too long in the mines .
my sight' s not as good as it was .
we' il see ...
no need .
i refuse to fly again .
get me into the militia .
please ...
someone who shoots like that is good enough for the militia .
it' s a static target .
allow me .
this i can still do .
they arrive at the last village held by franco' s men .
they must find out
how to cross the lines and reach the republicans ' airfield .
we' re going into that caf .
where are you going ? " ...
i' m sure the lines aren' t far .
we' ve done nothing .
we took the wrong road .
they won' t believe us .
they' il nab us .
what about the planes during this time ?
8 days ago ; that caf was ours .
it' s open .
we' ve just gone past it .
how will he know us ?
coffee with brandy .
no sugar .
it' il come soon .
two cups of coffee .
no sugar .
ln that case ... coffee with brandy .
okay .
it' il come soon .
okay .
we want a word with you .
armed ?
a little .
the garden' s out back .
leave that cat alone !
where can the lines be crossed ?
the street you came from ...
who sends you ?
pablo ; in linas .
at the end of the street ; you turn and ...
thanks for coming .
don' t mention it .
it' s not for you or for me .
where are the planes ?
ln the woods .
down tracks like these .
but further in .
it' s a big wood .
what' s the airfield like ?
where they take off ; you mean ?
it' s not like this one .
narrower ?
the soldiers are working on it non stop .
they' re making it bigger .
what orientation ?
ln the direction of the east wind .
so the woods are to the west of the field .
are you sure ?
1 00 % sure .
remember the direction the wind came from yesterday ?
north .
it felt like rain .
it' s the same here .
they' il have trouble taking off .
how many planes ?
i counted six small ones .
others claim to have seen more .
at least six big ones .
maybe there' s more .
where did you see them ?
i couldn' t tell you .
take me in your machine and i' il show you .
just like that !
have you ever flown before ?
won' t you be scared ?
will you recognize the airfield ?
i' ve lived in the village 28 years .
lf you show me the saragossa road ...
i can show you the airfield .
go and get some rest .
you' il need it .
phone the air office ; the war office ... whatever it takes .
ask for cars for the night take off .
we don' t have a single headlight .
i hope they do !
shut up !
what about the peasant ?
he knows where franco' s secret airfield is .
so ... tonight ?
you are appointed political commissary .
i' il announce it at tomorrow' s meeting .
do you know who i am ?
my father is one of the fascist leaders ...
... in my country .
i know that .
i accept .
you take the second plane .
we can have a try at night .
does the peasant really know where the airfield is ?
maybe .
ln this part of the world ; there' s no room for error .
the airfield
is here .
we' re here .
that' s why they blocked the bridge !
they can' t keep watch at night .
we have to start with the airfield .
at dawn .
lf we destroy it ; they' il only be able to warn their bases to the south .
we' il be on the bridge before then .
after ...
captain !
what ?
there' s not a car anywhere !
the war office have had 7 requests already .
but for different reasons .
it' s crucial .
a surprise bombing of an enemy airfield is stupid if it' s not done at night .
and if they attack ...
let' s hope for clouds !
as for the cars ;
we' il have to ask the villagers .
are the two crews ready ?
only two ?
come and see ; political commissary !
that' s the one they' re repairing ?
what about the reserve ?
we' ve been expecting the engines for 6 months .
so tonight ; zero fighter planes ?
no ; they won' t be back from madrid .
the main thing is to find some headlights .
let' s go get the cars .
the one we shot down yesterday .
they' ve improved them .
look at their machine gun .
but we still have a chance !
hurry up !
to take off at night , the two men
ask the peasants to lend them cars , so they can light up the airfield
with their headlights .
i' m in charge of the airfield .
i need some cars .
we' re leaving tonight and i' ve no lights .
we need car headlights .
and i don' t have any cars .
nor does the war office .
you do have cars .
3 cars and 2 trucks .
you need 1 2 cars !
it' s a matter of life and death for our comrades up there .
we can' t loan you the cars without our men .
they' ve already worked 1 5 hours today .
our mechanics will drive .
the drivers can sleep in the cars .
when do you want them ?
3 o' clock at the latest .
these cars and a few fires should do the trick .
we' d crash into the orange trees !
we' il do what we can .
three at least ; i promise .
and more if possible .
we still have to ensure supplies get through .
see if you can sort it out with the other villages .
aviation .
i understand your needs ; but a promise is a promise ;
and i can' t .
we' il do the best we can ; like the others .
3 cars !
you' re the last people we can ask .
we' il do our best .
let' s go ; sleepyhead !
how many cars ?
five .
let' s hope there' il be more .
who are they ?
volunteers .
what for ?
to carry the supplies .
where are the trucks ?
they' re at the airfield to help you out .
and he just puffs away in peace !
you' re back ; captain .
how many cars ?
they' re coming .
i told them where to put them .
when the whistle blows ; they' il turn on their lights .
we' il all crash into the orange trees ...
twelve ?
very good .
we' il come out at 5 o' clock .
tell your comrades not to be scared .
we won' t crash into them .
ls there no other landmark than teruel ?
after that ; follow the saragossa road up to the peasant' s village .
beyond silos .
i hope he recognizes it .
we' il go straight to the bridge .
it' il be daylight .
too late for them .
we' re 400 meters off course .
presently ; we' il be going through clouds .
land !
ours ?
no ... theirs .
we must be over teruel .
there' il be gaps in the clouds .
make a turn now .
ls that teruel ?
that' s teruel ?
does he recognize it ?
there' s the saragossa road !
go up again !
bearing 27 4 .
their field must be 20 kms . from here .
5 minutes .
lf we don' t find it right away ... we' il get caught by their fighters .
the clouds are hiding us .
looks like teruel hasn' t spotted us yet .
they haven' t fired .
what' s he up to ?
doesn' t he recognize it ?
lf he doesn' t spot it ; what then ?
must be around here .
dive !
there are mountains !
not that way .
go on .
the clouds are getting lower .
i' m going down to 200 meters .
lf there are any mountains ; we' il be in trouble .
do i turn ?
no time .
follow the road !
ls that your village ?
there' s the saragossa road .
where' s the landing field ?
lower !
there it is !
the fighters are coming !
open fire on the bunker !
ready ?
ready !
climb !
our bombs might damage us as they explode .
altimeter 300 ?
300 .
take aim .
their fighters aren' t far now .
and us ; with our 1 91 3 machine guns !
it' s migration time .
boys ; the captain' s coming back !
how about that for a nice piece of work !
all thanks to our mascot !
hey ; catch this !
too far for the vertical ; pujol .
turn ; for chrissakes !
dive !
don' t worry ; others will be coming .
they' re back !
put a tourniquet on .
rear turret ; they' re coming back !
they' re flying away !
our fighters are coming .
we' re falling ...
only one engine left .
suppose we glide ?
pujol ... are you wounded ?
climb !
the mountain !
pull up !
shut your face !
the first plane is back at base .
the captain , informed by telephone that a plane has crashed in the hills ; goes to rescue his men .
they' re not there .
the comrade says they crashed higher up .
ln the mountains .
higher up ; there' s only valdelinares .
shall i call ?
bullets ?
the man who was here before was one of us .
on july 1 8th ; he phoned madrid and ...
first of all ;
they spoke of mora hospital .
no one at the town hospital .
no one
at the school hospital .
then ; linares .
no one there either .
now ; higher up ; in the mountains ...
they called mora to ask for a doctor for the wounded pilots ; so maybe ...
he ; too ; wants to be a pilot !
it' s one of the pilots .
it' s you ; pujol ?
who' s dead ?
wounded ?
who' s able to walk ?
yes .
on mules .
are they taking care of you ?
they' re doing their best .
let me talk to the doctor .
can you make up some stretchers ?
i' il bring some .
start going down .
i' il wait for the ambulance .
it' il go as high up as it can .
take down the dead too .
aren' t the pilots with you ?
no ; they' re going down the ravine .
phone them and tell them .
i must stay here .
lf i could go ; i would .
what use would you be ?
i' m going !
me too .
to carry stretchers ?
you can hardly stand !
i' il do what i can .
you' il have to help .
what can you do for the dead ?
be grateful to him .
can you see ?
a little .
i can see you .
want anything ?
i want her to go to hell with her broth !
where' s the ambulance ?
it' il take us a good hour to get down .
got a mirror ?
the one with the face wound mustn' t drink .
but i used our last chicken ...
never mind .
my son' s at the front ; too .
we' re from val de san garcia .
what can we do ?
talk to the doctor .
you mustn' t let him drink ; even if he asks you to .
so you shot down their plane ?
i' il never have a chance to do it again .
of course you will .
the ambulance is here .
you and i know that' s not true .
with a bullet in the stomach ; i' ve got 3 hours .
look at the time .
give me my flying suit .
ask the doctor for his flying suit .
it' s all the same to me ...
i could' ve fallen ill and died in the mines .
you know ... during the fight ; they all held up their mascots ; like kids .
i looked at them .
tell them i never had contempt for them .
please ...
the way i looked at them embarrassed them .
it' s not that i despised them ... but that i understood i was old .
the suits are at the town hall .
what do you want ?
maybe i can get it for you .
a revolver .
i' ve had my time .
i don' t need any longer .
not till you' ve seen the doctor .
not till i' ve seen the doctor ...
where are they from ?
one' s german ; the other' s french ...
and that one ?
spanish .
and that one ?
an arab .
