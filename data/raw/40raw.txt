nobody here screwed up .

well , somebody somewhere thinks that you did .
you owe me 1 0 bucks .
she' s a redhead .
you really enjoy your job , don' t you , towns ?
kelly , right ?
kelly , there are few things i do enjoy ... but getting my balls broken while i' m trying to do my job isn' t one of them .
now , get your shit packed , get your crew together and load this airplane .

you' re the boss , frank .
<i> [ metal rattling ] </ i>

what the hell was that ?
that was the aerial , frank .
oh , great .
i' il go in the back and calm them down .

<i> [ aj . ] </ i>
<i>hello again , ladies . </ i>
as the frequent fliers amongst you can probably tell ... we' re experiencing some turbulence this morning ... <i>so / kindly ask you to remain seated ... </ i> and try not to shit yourselves all over my airplane .
what was that noise just now ?
everything' s fine .
<i>a wind gustjust tore off the aerial, </ i> <i>but we' re gonna keep going . </ i>
the aerial for the radio ?
<i>no , the one for the satellite tv . </ i>
<i>genius . </ i>
<i> [ kelly ]
christ, just turn around . </ i>
<i> [ aj . ] </ i>
<i>thank you so much . </ i>
excuse me .
excuse me !
you planning on flying over the storm ?
wanna close that door and get the hell back to your seat ?
i believe you' re too heavy .
will you deal with this ?
look like it' s goin ' higher .
we' il go around it .
set a course 1 8 0 due south .
<i>about 200 miles oughta do it . </ i>
<i> [ aj . ] </ i>
<i>copy .
1 8 0 . </ i>
we won' t make it .
the plane is overweight .
never as bad as this .
<i> [ groaning ] </ i>
<i>all right . </ i>
<i>we' re comin' around it .
okay . </ i>
<i>okay . </ i>
oh , god .
come on !
we' re in trouble here , a. j.
check the map .
find the nearest place we can set it down .
lhugar' s our best shot , but it' s 300 miles south of the basin .
maybe we can outrun it .
<i> [ grunting continues ] </ i>
<i>lhugar radio , this is amacore transport, </ i> <i>8 7 3 bravo .

<i>our location is approximately 40 degrees, </ i> <i>nine minutes north latitude ... </ i> <i>84 degrees , 42 minutes east longitude . </ i>

never get it back up again if we don' t .
any stations copy ?
a. j. , ready the passengers .
<i>listen up .
we got a major problem . </ i>

he' s right here .
jesus !

hey !
hey , where do you think you' re going ?
i can' t stay in here , man .
i can' t breathe !
hey !
that storm is blowin ' a hundred miles an hour out there !
it' il take your skin off before you get five feet .
now sit down !
sit down !
were you able to send a mayday before we came down ?
we got no response .
the radio' s down .
someone' s coming for us though , right ?
right ?
just as soon as the storm is over .
they know where to look for us ?
we don' t have the same kind of radar tracking we have in the states .
<i>oh , fantastic . </ i>
and it' s a big desert , isn' t it ?
<i> [ whimpering ] </ i>
<i>we were , uh , due to refuel</ i> <i>in langhu right about</ i> right about now , so it' il take ' em a couple of hours to miss us .
<i>so for right now, </ i> <i>everybodyjust sit tight . </ i>
<i>conserve your oxygen . </ i>
<i>hey , captain ?
don' t think</ i> <i>we don' t know what you did . </ i>
not many pilots , you know , could' ve done that ... so ... thank you .
yes .
thank you , captain .
<i> [ banging ] </ i>
yeah !
it' s like being in an hourglass .
i' m just a chef , but even i know ain' t no way a cell phone' s gonna work out here .
well , there' s no harm in trying , is there ?
you never know .
you never know .
i think the company man' s losing it .
what the hell are you laughing at ?
this is your fault !
why is it his fault ?
all that stuff about jinxes .
you can' t talk like that sitting in a plane on the bloody tarmac !
you' re the one who put the jinx on us .
oh , shut up .
<i> [ aj . ]
what' d / tell you ? </ i>
bunch of zeroes .
shouldn' t somebody say somethin ' ?
captain ?
i don' t think i' m the right person .
what the hell do they expect me to say ?
i don' t even know those guys .
maybe to say you' re sorry .
you' re looking to join those two ?
keep it up .
so what' s his story ?
who , him ?
yeah .
he just blew in one day .
blew in in the middle of the mongolian desert ?
said he was taking a year off work , hitching around the world .
<i>he was supposed to fly out a few weeks ago . </ i>
<i>his ride never came . </ i>
he' s been stuck with us ever since .
not bad .
that' s the last one .
all right .
well , we got a decent amount of water .
we each drink a pint a day ... that gives us enough for about 30 days , if we don' t exert ourselves .
which i' m guessin ' wasn' t a concern with the rest of this crew .
i don' t see you breaking a sweat , stud .
hey , che<i>f</ i> .
<i>yo . </ i>
chef , how are we doin ' on food ?
well , the good news is that besides the powdered eggs ... all the food' s been canned in water or juice .
the bad news is , it' s all peaches and hearts of palm .
well , that buys us a couple extra days .
ain' t that just great news .
so how screwed are we ?
pretty screwed .
<i> [ aj . ] </ i>
<i>where are we ? </ i>
somewhere around here , in the middle of the yol valley , 200 miles west of our course .
we' re still in mongolia ?
nah .
i think we' re in china .
j<i>ust over the border . </ i>
wouldn' t suppose there' d be a four seasons hotel out here , would there ?
langhu , a few hundred miles just due south of here .
well out of walking range .
<i> / could make it . </ i> <i> / could walk to langhu . </ i> <i> / ' m in good shape . </ i> <i> / ran three marathons . </ i>
<i> [ frank ] </ i>
<i>/ n a row , / hope . </ i>
have you walked in the desert before ?
i hiked in the mojave with my girlfriend .
<i>this isn' t the mojave . </ i>
this is the gobi .
and let me warn you , july is the hottest month in the gobi .
you will be taking a pint of water , and you' il sweat 1 0 .
i' il just go by night .
<i>you' d have to . </ i>
<i>but how would you keep your course ? </ i>
a compass .
<i>beyond these dunes, </ i> <i>we are surrounded by altai mountains . </ i>
<i>and they are mostly magnetic rock . </ i>
have you ever seen a compass dance ?
what about this map ?
i' il just take this map .
how old is that map , captain ?
too old , the way the sand shifts around here all the time .
and captain towns' s calculations could be off by 20 percent .
no offense .
i' m not saying that they are .
none taken .
but even if the captain is one percent in error ... <i>and you march 300 miles by the stars ... </ i> you' d miss langhu , and you wouldn' t even know it was there to miss .
you' d be walking in a circle .
<i>you' re right handed ? </ i>
<i>right . </ i>
<i>that means your right leg' s more developed</ i> <i>than your left .
you take a longer step with it . </ i>
you' d be walking in a left handed circle .
you know what ?
forget it , all right ?
y' all win , okay ?
<i>this isn' t about winning or losing . </ i>
this is about staying alive .
<i> [ thunder rumbling ] </ i>
hey , rod ?
hmm ?
you don' t [ whispering ]
you don' t think the suit was right ... do you ?
that i jinxed us or

davis ? telling him he jinxed us .

oh , come on .
i didn' t mean that .
quit screwing around !
he couldn' t have gone far .
could he ?
could he ?
how the hell could we lose someone ?
davis !
john !
we should have paired up .
someone should have been watching him .
hey !
not another word from you .
you hear me ?
john !
it' s coming .
<i> [ frank ] </ i>
he' s got to be out here somewhere .
i' ve got to go find him !
too late , rodney !
hey !
get back here !
right .
i' m not losing another friend out here .
i have to go and find him !
no !
no one else dies , understand ?
he' s only a kid , for christ' s sake !

alex !
god ! jesus ! john !
alex !
towns is right !
he' s right !
you can' t help him !
john !
you can' t .
john !
what kind of odds do you give us a search party' s gonna find us ?
about five percent .
right .
five percent .
so , based on a five percent chance ... you' re gonna choose to sit on your ass and do nothing ?
as opposed to what ?
trying to figure a way out of here .
look , we are in the middle of a desert ...
yes .
i know . with no radio , very little water , even less food .
if we try to walk out of here , we' re gonna last about two days .
<i>the odds of crashing an airplane</ i> so i would consider mysel<i>f</ i> an optimist .
or maybe just an asshole .
all right .
listen , since davis just disappeared , they' re pretty freaked out .
they should be .
they' re looking to you .
lady , this is not the girl scouts .
i am not everybody' s den mother .
they are grown men .
they can deal with it .
thanks a lot .
you' re welcome .
<i>kelly , please , come sit with me . </ i>
i' m just curious .
the pipe jacket in the back what' s it all worth ?
not much .
it' s worn or used up .
nothing .
it' s the same with the tools .
<i>why ? </ i>
hang on a minute .
you don' t think anybody' s coming .
<i>do you ? </ i>
well , do you ?
i don' t know , alex .
don' t be pathetic . <i> / ' m telling you , they' re coming . </ i>
i know they are .
<i>for who, you ? </ i>
<i>yes , for me . </ i>
and for you .
they have a corporate responsibility for all of us .
they' re out there right now , searching .
it' s just a matter of time . <i>recommending our site be closed down , right ? </ i>
yes , i did .
don' t you think they' d do the same thing before mounting a search for us ?
add it up .
<i> [ sammi ] </ i>
<i>don' t kid yourself , / an . </ i>
we hitched a ride with the trash ... not the other way around .
screw this .
i' m outta here .
yeah , i' m coming with you , and i' m taking some water .
no one touches the water !
hey .
whoa .
what' s going on here ?
what does it look like ?
hey !
get back here !
hey !
<i> [ frank ]
hey , knock it off . </ i>
go back !
let go !
it' s gone , you fools !
<i> [ shouting continues ] </ i>
i have an idea .
i have an idea .
i can get us out of here .
i can get us out of here .
i' ve been examining the plane .
you see , the the c 1 1 9 ... is a twin boom design ... and the starboard boom here isn' t damaged ... which is great because if if the starboard engine stays where it is at the forward end of the starboard boom this boom then becomes the fuselage ... becomes the plane .
<i>do you see what / ' m saying ? </ i>
<i>and and while the port area</ i> <i>of the tail unit is intact ... </ i> we will still have to redesign the tail section .
what the hell is he talking about ?
he' s talking about building a new airplane .
out of the old one .
<i> [ elliott ]
yes , captain . </ i>
and flying ourselves out of here .
yeah , why didn' t i think of that ?
<i>why don' t we build a swimming pool, </ i> <i>while we' re at it ? </ i>
oh , that' s funny .
<i>yeah . </ i>
well , you know , there are no component problems ... <i>and we have all the parts and tools</ i> <i>we need on board . </ i>
i assure you , we can do it .
it' s impossible .
at first glance , it seems impossible that a bee should fly ... but it does .
i think a bee stung you on your big dumb ass head .
what do you know about airplanes ?
i design them , mr. towns .
that' s what i know about airplanes .
<i>you might have mentioned that little piece</ i> <i>of information a bit earlier on , elliott . </ i>
who do you work for ?
what company ?
sizemore and pratt .
they' re in long beach .
they do mostly experimental aircraft .
mm hmm .
and you understand that engine' s got a 2, 000 pound thrust ?
yes .
so ?
when it gets started , it' s gonna tear your bee apart .
well , you' il just have to be careful this time .
the design is perfect .
the only flaw is that we have to rely on you to fly it .
i say we build the damn plane .
why the hell not ?
get us out of here .
let' s build it , man .
it' s better than doin ' nothin ' , fightin ' over water .
it' s worth a try .
oh , yeah .
it' s worth a try !
if we had a few months and an unlimited supply of water , which we don' t .
<i>and if you do try, you won' t live</ i>
none of you will .
we could work .
so what do <i>you</ i> think we should do ?
nothing .
what ?
<i>the longer we wait , the better chance</ i> <i>we have of somebody spotting us . </ i>
where' s liddle ?
oh , shit .
has anybody seen liddle ?
he' s definitely not in here .
oh , god .
we lost another one .
he' il never make it .
shit .
maybe he doesn' t give your sit on your ass and do nothing plan much hope .
hey , you' re not going after him .
no one else dies , remember ?
i' il go .
i' il bring him back .
a. j. ?
yeah ?
throw me that canteen .
good luck .
yeah .
captain , liddle' s first name is james .
jimbo .
liddle !
liddle !
no .
<i> [ flies buzzing ] </ i>
<i>someone' s already been here . </ i>
the dead guy' s kyle .
<i>he had a really nice seiko . </ i> <i> / know , ' cause he won it from me</ i> <i>in a poker game back at the patch . </ i>
someone came along and took it .
nomads .
smugglers , probably .
that' s the last thing we need .
you okay ?
i' m not going back .
i' m just resting .
you look like you could use some water .
so, just between the two of us
<i>no bullshit , captain towns</ i> do you think they' re ever gonna find us ?
it' s a long shot .
so why not try and build the plane ?
why give people false hope ?
come on , man .
most people spend their whole lives hanging on ... <i>to hopes and dreams that are never gonna</ i> <i>come true , but they hold on to ' em . </ i>
why are you gonna give up on ' em now when you need ' em most ?
you' re assuming i' m one of those people who has hopes and dreams .
i find it hard to believe that a man who learns to fly never had a dream .
look , how could i let those people build that plane ... when i don' t believe it' il work ?
and every day they waste trying to build it brings ' em one day closer to dying .
i think a man only needs one thing in life .
he just needs someone to love .
if you can' t give him that , then give him something to hope for .
<i>and if you can' t give him that ... </ i> just give him something to do .
james , you' il never make it .
then i' il die trying .
there are people counting on me .
okay !
okay , okay .
okay .
we' il build it .
just come back with me .
how do i know you' re not full of shit ?
here .
take it .
you can give it back when we get home .
what ?
nothing .
i' m just amazed .
by what ?
that during these dire times ... you take the time to thank god for anything .
well , we' re still alive , aren' t we ?
let me tell you a story .
a rabbi and a priest attend a boxing match .
they watch as the boxers come into the ring .
the rabbi sees one of the boxers cross himself .
<i>so the rabbi turns to the priest</ i> <i>and asks ... </ i>
what does that mean ?
the priest says , " not a damn thing if the man can' t fight .
<i> [ sammi ] </ i>
there you go .
yeah .
<i> [ frank sighs ] </ i>
liddle and i had a talk .
i think we should build the plane .
wha
<i>elliott ... </ i> can you really design this thing the way you said you could ?
<i>no bullshit ? </ i>
yes , i can .
well , we' re either all in this together or no one at all .
<i>no compromises . </ i>
i' m in .
yeah .
yeah , me too .
shit .
me three .
okay .
get some rest .
we start tonight .
let' s take them inside .
it' s cooler .
hold on .
let me take this .
if we do this , we' il be cutting our lives in half .
we' il be drinking twice as much water , frank .
we don' t have any other choice .
why ?
' cause it' s too early to give up , a. j .... and too late to do anything else .
i' m glad that you' ve finally seen the light , mr. towns .
hey .
let' s get one thing straight .
i' m not taking orders from you .
get some rest .
hey , towns .
thanks .
are you kidding me ?
i' d do anything to avoid another hopes and dreams speech .
okay , gentlemen , our our first task is to separate the wing here ... so so we can join it with the main fuselage , okay ?
<i> [ sammi ] </ i>
i' m gonna need some help .
make sure they' re good and tight , ian , eh ?
<i>all right . </ i>
there you go .
you still got some of them old muscles up there , don' t you ?
<i> [ elliott ]
you guys need to be careful</ i> <i>when you step on the wing , okay ? </ i>
<i>man , / thought this would be easy . </ i>
hey , no coffee breaks .
that means you too .
you know , i liked him a lot better when all he did was hum .
<i> [ aj .

<i>yeah, you still got it . </ i>
whoa !
aah !
watch what you' re doin ' , man .
you got it , rod ?
hang on .
<i> [ rodney ]
on three, yeah ? </ i>
<i>[ jeremy ]
let' s do it . </ i>
one , two , three !
there you go !
yeah , baby !
yeah !
i' il be damned .
<i>that' s a start , frank . </ i>
oh , geez .
somebody turn out the lights .
how much water did we drink ?
too much .
and that' s at night .
<i> [ torch crackling ] </ i>
two eighths .
frank .
hmm ?
you okay ?
when i was out there , when i found liddle ...
yeah ?
i saw something pretty weird .
what ?
you know that poor son of a bitch that fell out of the airplane ?
yeah ?
i found shell casings all around his body .
looked like someone had been using him for target practice .
oh ... shit .
just keep that to yourself , all right ?
i don' t want to give ' em anything more to worry about .
here .
oh , yeah .
<i>hey , patch . </ i>
how ' bout a nice ice cold double mint frappuccino ?
screw that .
how ' bout a bacardi and coke ?
ahh .
with a lot of ice .

how ' bout a hamburger with a lot of cheese ?
whoa , whoa .

i' m tryin ' to watch my figure , you know ?

one day .
<i>yeah .
someday soon , man . </ i>
how' s it going ?
is everybody okay ?

ah , geez .
<i>oh , my god . </ i>
everybody here ?
<i>oh , christ . </ i>
<i>oh , no . </ i>
<i>tell me that wasn' t all the fuel . </ i>
<i>we' re gonna need</ i> <i>the remaining fuel for the plane . </ i>
we' re gonna have to work during the day .
what ?
and what kind of hole is that gonna put us in with the h2o ?
we' re gonna run out before we even finish the damn plane .
<i> [ / an ]
not necessarily .
day shift output</ i> <i>is always higher than night anyway . </ i>
if we add in the fact that we' re gonna be able to see what we' re doing ...
i' d estimate that our productivity per pint ... would actually increase .
we' d drink more , finish sooner .

no , no , no , no .
we do not have time for rods and linkages .
as you should know , we have an extremely large lifting surface .
it' s oversized for the weight load .

it <i>is</ i> raining .

it' s electrical .

we gotta get out of here .

the storm it' s electrical .

so what ?
the plane' s not grounded !
i don' t understand your problem .
you don' t understand ?
that wing is full of fuel .

you' d think someone ... who designs airplanes for a living would ... know they need to be grounded .

<i> [ rady ] </ i>
<i>very good , mr. towns .
and mr. liddle . </ i>
yeah , you learn a lot of useless bullshit waiting to take off .
i thought you weren' t religious , rady .
spirituality is not religion .
religion divides people .
belief in something unites them .
is that spelled right ?

<i> [ aj . ]
okay , / need everyone</ i>
whoa .
what the  a. j.
someone' s stealing water .
i' ve had a suspicion for the last few days ... so i' ve been checking the levels .
we don' t need a gun .
a. j.
you planning on shooting someone , a. j. ?
while you' ve all been sleeping ...
i' ve been working .
and , therefore , i require more water .
are you kidding me ?
why didn' t you just ask ?
because i' m in charge of building my plane ... and i don' t need to ask anyone anything .
we could all die of thirst !
you need me , towns .
don' t forget that .
you need me .
everyone here is dispensable except me .

<i> [ rodney ] </ i>
<i>but they could help us . </ i>
they could have water .
maybe we could bargain with them .
what do you think ?
should we go over there and find out ?
whatever you wanna do , frank .
<i>what are you doing ? </ i>
<i>you can' t go over there . </ i>
we can' t risk losing the pilot .
then i' il go .
you cover me .
did you hear what i just said ?
we got this , elliott .
ian , don' t you think you should go as well ?
why me ?
because you know most of the local dialects .
you do ?
hold on .
he' s had to .
he' s worked all over the gobi doing negotiations with local crews .

ian , what is he saying ?
we didn' t know what else to do .
we couldn' t just let him die .
and why not ?
these bastards killed rodney .
there' s not enough water for anybody else , and he' s not getting any peaches .
maybe we can give him some of rodney' s share .
yeah .
why don' t you just offer him your watch while you at it , asshole ?
he' s a human being , man !
we should have just let them go their own way .
they probably wouldn' t even have seen us .
don' t be stupid .
they would have killed us all if they had a chance .
you don' t know that .
i know they ain' t hesitate when they killed rodney !
<i>what are you people thinkin</ i> ' , <i>man ? </ i>
he can' t stay around here .
oh , yeah ?
well , where are we gonna take him ?
pick his ass up and drag him back where you found him at .
shit !
well , that settles that .
what the hell is the matter with you ?
oh , shut up .
he would have survived only a couple of days drinking all of our water .
i did us a favor .
you murdered him , asshole !
no , no , no , no , no , no .
the great captain towns murdered him .
in his infinite wisdom ... he let you go over there , and i told you not to !
and now we' re one man short .
that' s 1 2 man hours lost every day we work .
last night alone cost us 84 man hours ... because none of you worked at all !
<i>you</ i> made the wrong decision !
you could have killed us all again !

i had to take on another passenger !
you !

but we need him .
elliott ?
<i> [ sammi ] </ i>
come on , elliott .
you' re the only one who can get us out of here .
to tell you the truth , i' m no longer interested .
we' ve wasted too much time already .
if i had the strength of 1 0 men ...
i would have had that thing built by now .
but all i have is you ... and your unreliable people .
we' re ready to be reliable now .

mr. towns .
who' s the boss of everyone ?
you are , elliott .
you' re the boss of everybody .
<i>now , can we please ... </ i> finish the airplane ?
please ?
careful .
did you clean the sand out of the engine and do your preflight , mr. towns ?
three times .
well , do it again .
what the hell are they waitin ' for ?
they' re waiting for us to be too weak to fight back .
it' s ready .
<i>[ jeremy ] </ i>
<i>know what this looks like ? </ i>
like a plane .
with wings and everything .
think it' il fly ?
i' il shit myself if it does .
oh , it' il fly .
it better .
how you doing ?
i' m thirsty , hungry and tired .
and i gotta get that thing up in the air .
but otherwise , i' m having a hell of a time .
how about you ?
i' m laughing .
all i have to do is sit back , relax and enjoy the flight .
you' il get us out of here .
i know you will .
um , frank , i wanted to ask you something .
what did alex say to you just before he died ?
don' t crash .
take something only to cover yourselves up with .
nothing more .
hey , where' s the chart ?
i want to tape it to the floor .
it' s in my bag right there .
<i> / need you to check these cables</ i> <i>one more time . </ i>
this the outfit you work for ?
this catalog .
yeah .
these are models .
wh where' s the big stuff ?
uh , well ... <i>there' s the , uh ... </ i>
stealth magnum .
i designed that one a few years ago .
the biggest we make ... would have to be the <i>albatross . </ i>
horrible name .
it' s a six foot wingspan parasol model .
but it' s not my design because it' s a glider , and i only work on power models .
<i>but you design the big stuff too . </ i>
<i>right , elliott ? </ i>
<i>planes that carry people . </ i>
<i>planes like the</ i> phoenix .
<i>right ? </ i>
no , no .
sizemore and pratt only build model airplanes .
but ... that' s who you design for .
i' m their chief designer , yes .
you build toy planes , man ?
no , i most certainly do not design toy planes .
<i>a toy plane is one of those balsa wood</ i> <i>creations that run on a rubber band . </ i>
those are not toys .
these are toys .
those are not toys .
they' re not full sized aircraft either , elliott .
you see this shit ?
he' s a goddamn toy maker !
i think , mr. towns , you should appreciate two very important things .
<i>first of all , precisely similar</ i> <i>principles of aerodynamics ... </ i> <i>apply to both scale</ i> <i>and full sized aircraft . </ i>
what is he saying ?
<i>we should have waited , man . </ i>
<i>we' d still have water left . </ i>
<i>air foil surfaces, </ i> the whole pattern of heavier than air construction are all precisely similar .
we' re gonna die out here .
<i>the second thing you should realize</ i> <i>is that a model plane has to fly itself . </ i>
<i>there is no pilot . </ i>
the design must be even more efficient than that of a full sized aircraft .
well , i' m looking through your catalog here ... and i don' t see anything about a flying sled with people on the wings !
they' re toy airplanes !
what kind of crap is that ?
my plane will fly .
you knew all along that you was buildin ' a toy airplane !
<i> [ kelly ] </ i>
<i>/ an , what are you doing ? </ i>
we' d have had two more weeks if it weren' t for you .
they could have found us .
the plane will fly !
we should have listened to towns in the beginning .
sit tight , save water , and they' il find us .
what are you doing ?
but no .
you had to build your plane .
and you' re not even one of us .
ian !
put that gun down !
nobody' s shooting anybody !
we' re not going out like that !
my plane will fly !
give me the gun !
no , no , i was just saying , i' m a very important person to them .

they' re looking for me .
