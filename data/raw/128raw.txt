in other world news ...

good to see you .
thanks for stoppin ' by .
for the record , we' ve been joined by nathan muir , near east ops .
we' re in the process of dealing ... with a fairly specific ... international flap .
we brought you in here as a stop gap .
fill in a few holes for us .
so i' m like the little dutch boy , huh ?
yeah !
we just need you to be a team player on this one , muir .
why is that funny ?
every time my coach told me that , i knew i was about to get benched .
due to the nature of this task force , nathan , there will be certain information which you don' t need to know .
a week ago , tom bishop disappeared in hong kong .
last night he turned up outside shanghai .
he' s been arrested for espionage .
we' re working up a profile based on relevant personal histories and op records .
this has to be handled with kid gloves .
how long does the president have to claim him ?
twenty four hours .
starting when ?
as of now , nathan .
bishop has been classified as a common criminal , and will be executed at 8 : 00 a. m. tomorrow morning , our time .
what about the press ?
why not leak it and throw the spotlight on china , and buy us some time ?
we need the press on this like we need a third teat .
you using the other two ?
we don' t want outside influences to ... limit our options .
what was bishop doing in china ?
he was with an operation for harry duncan .
was ?
yes .
until he took matters into his own hands .
well , where are they holding him ?
oh , i' m sorry , nathan .
it would be nice to know what gaps are filled .
i' ve only got ten fingers here , you know ?
i guess , kind of tough timing , hmm ?
a week before the president' s road trip .
you guys afraid there' s gonna be a congressional hearing ?
that' s why we' re transcribing and videotaping .
right ?
are you gonna want me to testify ?
no .
no ?
absolutely not .
you met bishop in vietnam , right ?
yeah .
spring of' 75 .

i don' t believe we' ve met .
who are you ?
dr. william byars .
national security council .
was there a finding , muir ?
well , we were in a place we weren' t supposed to be , assassinating a general from a country we weren' t at war with of course , we weren' t officially at war with north vietnam , either
is that a " no " ?
oh , come on , guys .
we' re on the clock .
the president admits bishop is ours , denies he' s a spy , we put out the fires and negotiate a deal .
unless i' m missing something .
muir' s secretary' s on [ indistinct ]
mm .
this will just take a second .
stop recording .
stop tape .
your secretary' s got your wife on the line .
she says it' s urgent .
go ahead .
want to take it outside ?
no , no .
i' il take it in here .
that' s fine .
hello ?
got your message .
you want me to start a fire yet ?
oh , uh , right .
this' il just take a second .
right .
tell you what .
why don' t you hold that reservation , and , uh , we may still be able to use it .
you might just .
as we speak , there are three guys rummaging ... through everything i spent a week packing .
uh huh .
okay .
uh huh .
if there were any instances of personal dysfunction , right . emotional or psychological , it could be helpful .
okay .
it' s insubstantial .
right .
right .
mm hmm .
okay .
that' il be good .
because presidential findings ...
have no real importance .
you still there ?
y yeah .
so he was an assassin , recruited to kill .
sounds good .
bye bye .
sorry .
wife planning a retirement dinner .
assassin ?
i think i just figured it out .

closet .
it' il just take a second .
i' il send a security officer down .

he' s on his way down .
you were right .
it rained .
what about these ?

free trade .

agency' s looking for a reason to let the chinese kill tom bishop .
no !
ah , they shut down my secure line last day and all .

thanks .
aw , well [ clears throat ]
oh , i' m sorry .
it' s classified .
do you mind ?
oh !
uh , right .
there' s nothing there .

it' s not in english either .
this fax just came in a few moments ago , sir .
yeah .
so , sir , you and muir came up together , right ?
mm .
how well do you know him ?
no one knows nathan .
not really .
do you trust him ?
he' s a man who got the job done .
is he on the job now ?
office of security , hong kong .
ten to seven this morning , a call originated from station to muir' s home .
he knew about bishop before he got here .
and he played dumb .
yeah , this is harker .
i need confirmation on all calls ... in and out of nathan muir' s office .
gee , i' m hungry .
hong kong herald .
digger gibson , please .
one moment , sir .
hello ?
gibby , old boy .
nathan !
to what do i owe this honor ?
still have contacts at cnn ?
i got something for you .
talk to me .
how about " c. i. a. operative caught in the act ofespionage " ?
can you get that on the air ?
that' s not gonna be easy .
come on , gibby .
that' s never stopped you before .
give me 30 minutes .
yeah .
i remember seeing something about bishop in my south american box , but it wasn' t there .
those op files downloaded yet ?
let' s go with this .
bishop' s recruitment .
yeah .
well , back then , recruitment took time .
bishop was evacuated with the last of them on the 30th of april , and that gave me a month to do my homework .
i talked to his neighbors , his teachers , his mom scoutmaster
pulled his dad' s records from the pentagon .
then started to move some pieces around on the board .
and my plan was to isolate and alienate .
your valleys and your farms
i had his c. o. give him just menial duties ... with non english speaking personnel .
and i kept him in limbo about even the possibility of going home .
and then i watched ... and waited .
this consignment is a complete misdirect .
it needs to go to military h. q in mannheim .
you understand ?
fuck !
then , in december , when i didn' t think he could take anymore ,
i made the move .
these mist covered mountains
are a home now to me
there she is .
but my home is the lowlands
uh , sorry sir .
it' s bishop .
sergeant bishop ?
oh , christ .
of course !
hi .
yeah , hi .
sandy , this is tom bishop .
tom , right ?
yes , sir .
tom , sir .
tom .
how are you ?
nice to meet you .
sandy ?
my second wife .
second wife ?
he asked me what i was doing in berlin , and i told him i was there as a military liaison of a sort .
it' s good to hear an american voice again , i' il tell you that .
i' il bet , i' il bet .
what are you doing for christmas ?
no plans .
oh , the weather outside is frightful
but the fire is so delightful
central intelligence ?
train you as an agent .
you' d be working for me .
mostly undercover .
europe ?
wherever the action is .
what if i preferred ... to just go home ?
that' s okay .
it' s fine .
i can probably make arrangements for you to end your tour of duty in san diego .
in which case , i' il presume you' il forget we ever had this conversation .
but look , it' s your choice .
all the way home i' il be warm [ chuckles softly ]
the next day , we started his tradecraft .
the technology gets better every day , and that' s fine .
but most of the time , all you need is a stick of gum , a pocket knife and a smile .
that' s disappointing .
guten morgen , meine herren .
today we' re going to be discussing a radio set .
not just any radio set , but a russian radio set .
every building , every room , every situation is a snapshot .
while i' m sitting here talking to you , i' m also checking the room , memorizing it .
the people .
what they' re wearing .
then i ask the question ,
what' s wrong with this picture ?
anything suspect ?
you' ve gotta see it , assess it and dismiss most of it ...
without looking , without thinking .
without thinking ?
it' s just like breathing .
you breathe , don' t you ?
always carry cigarettes and a lighter too .
great ice breaker .
eine kaffee , bitte .
zwei .
okay , i want you to listen , but i want your concentration to be on something different .
anything else , so you don' t react .
understand ?
yes .
so when do i get my first assignment ?
when i decide you' re ready .
what is your name ?
michael sandville .
the suit in the kitchen .
threat ?
wait , how' d you see that ?
ah !
see that apartment building ?
yeah ?
know anyone who lives there ?
no .
within five minutes , i want to see you standing on one of those balconies .
come on .
did you serve in vietnam ?
no , i did not .
favorite color ?
why don' t we discuss it over coffee ?
you just lost ten seconds .
solicit information from someone .
gladly .
the guy reading the menu .
don' t look at him .
he wasn ' t reading the menu .
he' s not reading at all .
threat ?
only to the hostess .
you just gave her four pieces of personal information ... for one dubious , impersonal fact .
just trying to find out where she got that dress .
where are you from ?
when' s your birthday ?
you know everything about me .
i don' t know a thing about you .
okay , what did you tell her ?
one , you' re straight .
two , you' re engaged .
three , tomorrow' s your girl' s birthday , and four , you have no taste in women' s fashions .
what if she were an asset ?
you told her four lies that now have to be true .
okay .
i thought spies drank martinis .
scotch , never less than 12 years old .
is that right ?
agency rules ?
my rules .
all right , so what else ?
what else do i need to know ?
put away some money so you can die someplace warm .
don' t ever touch it .
not for anyone .
ever .
okay .
is that it ?
don' t ever risk your life or your career for an asset .
if it comes down to you or them , send flowers .
he was a natural .
he could take an east german who had just come over the wall ,
look him straight in the eye , and ask him to go back ... to the place he just fled and spy for us .
he got so good at it he could close in a single afternoon , send the guy out with a smile .
let me get this straight : you allowed a contract agent to develop assets ?
he was that good .
i thought he' d make a fine case officer someday .
let' s get on with it .
i' d like to hear whatever you can offer about ...
operation rodeo .
rodeo ?
the cathcart affair ?
hold transcription , hold tape .
i' il be right back .
you know , this would go a lot faster , you guys , if you' d tell me a little something about the op .
what' s it called ?
sideshow ?
what about it ?
how' d you come by this information ?
just stuff we learn in the field .
sorry about that .
okay , where were we ?
i think we were talking about ...
operation rodeo right , chuck ?
you' re on .
my east german contacts ... discovered that we had an unidentified mole in the embassy .
we had the ambassador in our crosshairs , until some information leaked when he was out of the country .
so that just left one possibility .
ah , ann .
hello .
ann  ... cathcart .
yeah .
bishop was involved in a small but integral part of the operation going east to bring across an east german functionary named schmidt .
ready ?
yeah .
ah , fuck !
the passport' s in the glove box .
there' s some vodka .
spill it on your coat .
if they stop us , don' t say a word .
remember , you' re drunk .
and where is mrs. muir ?
patricia left me and filed for divorce .
oh , i' m so sorry , nathan .
how is it i always say the wrong things ?
patricia ?
yeah , my third wife .
my god , how many wives have you had ?
four .
you want to hear about them , or bishop ?
you see that gentleman ?
yeah ?
he' s the ambassador .
why don' t you go over there and say hello to him ?
okay .
okay ?
your scotch is older than she is .
am i supposed to feel bad about that ?
they know .
they have my family already , i know it .
if they knew , they would have stopped us .
tomorrow , your wife , your kids , will all be safe in munich .
i gotta make a stop .
what ?
it' s a scheduled stop .
i gotta make a phone call .
they follow you .
friedrich , it' s all taken care of , okay ?
if they ask , tell ' em i got sick .
why don' t we go outside ?
i' m sure we won' t be missed .
i wish i could .
i have to stay near the phone .
working on a saturday night ?
are you bringing someone across ?
bitte .
yes ?
vodka did me in .
i' m comin ' home .
throw out the bottle .
repeat that ?
throw out the bottle .
they know .
they don' t know .
they don' t fuckin ' know .
they' il be waiting .
drop as close to checkpoint as possible .
negative , we' re comin ' across .
no .
that' s an order .
let him go .
they will kill him .
change of plans , friedrich .
no .
you will drive me across , just as you said .
if i do that , they' il kill us both .
this way , we still have a chance .
you' re a liar .
this way , you still have a chance .
i can' t help you .
just get out of the car .
i will not get out .
get out ofthe car !
get out !
i will not get out !
i will not !
no !
no !
no !
no !
get out .
get out !
please .
my wife .
my children .
i can' t help you !
nathan , what happened ?
what went wrong ?
nothing .
nothing ?
actually , one thing .
don' t ever question me again .
ever .
what ?
i gave you an order , you take it .
you don' t ask why .
those ten seconds on the phone could have blown the op .
the op was bringing schmidt across !
the op was setting up ann cathcart .
and your end had to look legit .
what are you telling me ?
schmidt was bait ?
yes .
nathan , they executed him on a shitty cellar floor !
it could have been you .
let me tell you something about schmidt .
he went to the russians a week ago , and said he had a contact , an american .
somebody he could use .
don' t tell me that .
you didn' t look in his eyes .
don' t tell me that !
he was your asset .
somebody you used for information .
aw , jesus christ !
you don' t just trade these people like they' re baseball cards .
it' s not a fuckin ' game !
oh , yes , it is .
that' s exactly what it is .
and it' s no kid' s game , either .
this is a whole other game .
and it' s serious and it' s dangerous and it' s not one you want to lose .
nathan , we killed this man .
we used him , and we killed him .
okay , then you gotta help me understand this one .
you nathan , what are we doin ' here ?
don' t give me some bullshit about the greater good .
that' s exactly what it' s about .
because what we do is unfortunately very , very necessary .
and if you' re not willing to sacrifice scum like schmidt ... for those that want nothing more than their freedom , then you better take a hard look at your profession , my friend .
because it doesn' t get any easier .
why did you use me ?
do you want to walk ?
walk .
you should have told me about the op .
you used me .
i did .
and listen to this , because this is important .
if you had pulled some stunt over there ,
i wouldn' t come after you .
you go off the reservation , i will not come after you .
fuck your rules , nathan .
okay .
but tonight , they saved your life .
can we have the relevant files on ann cathcart ?
ann cathcart' s body was found ... in the lobby of a cheap hotel in east germany , just two months after she defected .
yeah .
beaten to death .
vopos never solved the case .
and bishop was in berlin when this happened .
we were both in berlin do you recall bishop' s reaction ... to the news that ann cathcart was dead ?
motive and opportunity .
nathan , you should leave here knowing that we' re looking into every possible scenario .
what' s " sideshow " ?
you don' t need to know .
why are you trying to burn bishop ?
troy ?
hold transcription , hold video .
sideshow was a bugging op .
listening to government offices in eastern china .
the trade talks ?
mm .
and you' re afraid the lid to the cookie jar is gonna slam shut on our hand ?
oh , come on , guys !
chinese need trade status more than we need to give it .
that' s not necessarily so .
twenty four hours after capture , bishop' s allowed to start talking .
that gives you , what ?
ten , twelve hours to make a trade .
come on .
you' re on the clock .
he doesn' t know anything .
bishop wasn' t on sideshow .
he wasn' t working for us .
he was arrested during a rescue attempt ... at a prison outside su chou .
who was he after ?
don' t know .
let go of me !
for more on this late breaking story , we go live to hong kong .
it has been confirmed that the chinese claim ... to have arrested an american operative for the c. i. a.
while the state department remains quiet , official sources say that the individual , working out of american consulate in hong kong , was captured in an act of espionage .
if confirmed , this comes at a bad time for an administration ... which is in the middle of trade negotiations with china .
the u. s. government is in the process of negotiating his release .
the embassy promised to keep us a breast ...
we are so fucked . of the situation as it develops .
this is frank nall , live in hong kong .
guess that limits our options .
i want to know what you have to say about this , and i want it on the record .
when i was a kid , i used to spend summers on my uncle' s farm .
and he had this plow horse that he used to work with every day .
he really loved that plow horse .
one summer she came up lame , and could barely stand .
the vet offered to put her down .
you know what my uncle said ?
no , muir .
what did he say ?
he said , " why would i ask somebody else to kill a horse that belonged to me ?
get me peter brody at the fcc .
i don' t care .
just get him .
looks like bishop' s gonna be okay .
good .
what about the flag ?
keep it .
something to remember me by .
you know where to store this stuff , right ?
yeah .
what do i do with the storage key ?
if i need it , i' il send for it .
i' il send you a postcard .
from where ?
not a chance .
you' d show up and try to clean the place , and scare the native girls away .
i wish .
i' il be working for andy unger down the hall .
you' re gonna miss it .
you know that , don' t you ?
thank you .
thank you .
mm hmm .
have a nice day .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
mm hmm .
thank you .
for more on this story , we go live to hong kong .
and , in a late breaking development of the incident reported earlier , rumors that tom bishop , an alleged c. i. a. operative , had been captured in an act of espionage , now appears to be a hoax .
tom bishop died 14 months ago .
while the c. i. a. has made no official comment , sources close to the agency have confirmed bishop' s death late last year .
the discredited story has been attributed ... to an overzealous member of the chinese government , who leaked the false information in the hopes of undermining the current u. s. trade negotiations .
this is frank nall , live in hong kong .
mr. muir ?
told you you' d miss it .
who do you trust in military intelligence ?
i co signed martha rayburn' s car loan .
listen , gladys .
i gotta buy some time here .
i' m gonna need imagery analysis fora military prison near su chou .
and if you use the phones , don' t use these .
any chance i could lose my job over this ?
good .
i didn' t want to work for andy unger anyway .
i know who it is .
i know who bishop was after .
well , so do we .
but do you know why ?
i mean , if anybody knew the back story ,
i mean , it would , well , uh ,
it' s just that it would make a congressional hearing really worth watching .
by the way , that' s not in the op reports .
muir , you' re not cleared to be in here .
relax , kappler .
if i didn' t have clearance , how did i get in ?
where' s this report ?
i just came from the seventh floor , and there' s some people pretty disappointed it hasn' t arrived yet .
hold on !
what report ?
you were at the briefing .
i' m talking about tom bishop .
bishop went rogue .
yeah , and they were gonna ... pull him out until somebody up there and i' m not gonna say who said that your department claimed there weren' t enough resources .
who said that ?
look , i can buy some time while you pull this together .
now , operation sideshow .
that' s near the prison , right ?
near su chou .
china .
come on .
any air support ?
oh .
shit , that' s probably folger .
yup .
p' eng hu islands .
