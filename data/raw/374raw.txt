and the cost is more than i can bear .

father !

perfect .

more than half .
those swimming breaks reaily cut into the day , don' t they ?
told you .
thomas .
wait for father .
sorry .
that' s her .
the north star .
see ?
you start from the front two stars of the big dipper .
and then you count up .
you count up five finger iengths ... ... and it' s right there .
and she' ii always be iooking down on us .
and protect us .
forever .
come .
into bed .
good night .
good night , meg .
it helps her to know mother' s there .
good night .
so what was in the mail ?
peter cuppin joined the continentals .
he' s 1 7 , a year younger than i.
weil , the assembly' s been convened , so i' ve been cailed to charles town .
we' re going to charles town ?
we are .
we ieave in the morning .
aunt charlotte !
margaret , wiiliam , iook at you .
missed you .
they' re huge .
what have you been feeding them ?
weil , they' re from good stock .
on their mother' s side , of course .
thank you .
come inside .
wait untii you see what i have .
presents ?
presents for us ?
move slowly .
keep an eye on these heathens , wiii you ?
sorry .
i have this for you , susan .
it belonged to your mother .
she' s stiii not talking ?
no .
it does me good to see you .
look , there' s gabriel .
hang king george !
death to king george !
hang them ail !
hang the iot of them !
my name is peter howard .
i iost most of my hearing and my ieft ieg ... ... fighting for the crown in the french and indian war .
and how did king george reward me ?
he cuts off my other ieg with his taxes .
miss howard , isn' t it ?
you know who i am , gabriei martin .
the iast time you saw me , i was 1 1 and you put ink in my tea .
i believe that was one of my younger brothers .
perhaps samuei or nathan .
it was you , and it turned my teeth black for a month .
and send a message to king george he wiii never forget !
our first order of business
and our iast , if we vote a ievy !
order , order !
mr. simms , you do not have the floor .
first , an address by colonei harry burweii of the continentai army .
colonei burweil .
you aii know why i' m here .
i' m not an orator .
and i would not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause .
i' m a soldier .
and we are at war .
from philadelphia , we expect a declaration of independence .
8 of the 1 3 colonies have ievied money ... ... in support of a continentai army .
i ask that south carolina be the ninth .
massachusetts and virginia may be at war ... ... but south carolina is not !
hear , hear .
this is not a war for the independence of one or two colonies ... ... but for the independence of one nation .
and what nation is that ?
an american nation !
there is no such nation and to speak of one is treason .
we are citizens of an american nation .
and our rights are being threatened ... ... by a tyrant 3000 miles away .
would you teii me , please , mr. howard ... ... why should i trade one tyrant 3000 miles away ... ... for 3000 tyrants one mile away ?
an elected iegislature can trample a man' s rights as easily as a king can .
captain martin ... ... i understood you to be a patriot .
if you mean by " patriot , " am i angry about taxation without representation ?
weil , yes , i am .
should the american colonies govern themselves independently ?
i believe they can .
and they should .
but if you' re asking me am i wiiling to go to war with england ... ... then the answer is most definitely no .
this from the same captain benjamin martin whose fury was so famous ... ... during the wilderness campaign ?
i was intemperate in my youth .
temperance can be a disguise for fear .
mr. middleton , i fought with captain martin ... ... under washington in the french and indian war .
there' s not a man in this room ... ... or anywhere for that matter , to whom i would more wiilingly trust my iife .
there are alternatives to war .
we take our case before the king .
we plead with him .
we tried .
weil , then , we try again and again if necessary to avoid a war .
i was at bunker hiil .
the british advanced three times .
we kiiled 700 at point blank range and stiii they took the ground .
that is the measure of their resolve .
if your principles dictate independence ... ... then war is the only way .
it is come to that .
hear , hear .
i have seven children .
my wife is dead .
now , who' s to care for them if i go to war ?
wars are not fought only by childiess men .
granted .
but mark my words .
this war wiii be fought , not on the frontier ... ... or on some distant battlefield ... ... but amongst us .
among our homes .
our children wiii iearn of it with their own eyes .
and the innocent wiii die with the rest of us .
i wiii not fight .
and because i wiii not fight , i wiii not cast a vote ... ... that wiii send others to fight in my stead .
and your principles ?
i' m a parent .
i haven' t got the iuxury of principles .
we must vote to ievy !
28 to 1 2 !
the ievy passed !
you intend to enlist without my permission ?
yes , i do .
father , i thought you were a man of principle .
when you have a family of your own , perhaps you' ii understand .
when i have a family of my own , i won' t hide behind them .
he' s as imprudent as his father was at his age .
regrettably so .
i' ii see to it that he serves under me .
make him a clerk or quartermaster , something of that sort .
good iuck .
though many seasons have passed ... ... it seems like onlyyesterday when we last saw each otherin charles town .
with sadness , i learned ofits recent fall to the british ... ... under general cornwallis .
i received a letter from aunt charlotte ... ... saying she closed herhome in charles town after the city fell ... ... and moved to herplantation on the santee .
here in the north , our campaign has been marked by defeat and privation .
ourlosses have been grievous .
my good friend , peter cuppin , fell at elizabethtown .
his death has been difficult to bear .
we will march south with general gates ... ... to fight the redcoats under cornwallis .
thank you , sir .
easy , red .
easy .
i envyyou ... ... youryouth and distance from this cruel conflict of which i am a part .
but i am fortunate to be serving the cause of liberty .
and though i fear death ... ... each day in prayer i reaffirm my wiilingness ... ... to give my iife in its service .
pray for me .
but above ail , pray for the cause .
your ioving brother , gabriel .
what are you doing ?
turn around .
not yet , thomas .
when ?
seventeen .
that' s two years .
it' s already been two .
the war could be over by then .
god wiiling .

seventeen .
aii right .
put it back , please .
father ?
what happened at fort wilderness ?
put it away .
six pounders .
lots of them .
how far away ?
they' re a iong way off .
they' re most iikely heading the other direction .
put those in the house .
they might come this way .
must i teii you again ?
let' s aii stay close in to the house , aii right ?
we' ii have to fight them off .
won' t father do that ?
they' ii probably kiii us men ... ... and do lord knows what to you women .
nathan !

no , not yet .
abigale , the children , please .
children , come .

gates marched us straight at the redcoats .
our iines broke .
the british green dragoons cut us to bits .
i was given these dispatches .
as i ieft , i saw the virginia regulars surrender .
the dragoons rode into them .
kiiled them ail .
over 200 men .
i have to get these dispatches to hiilsborough .
you can' t ride .
i can' t stay here !
it' s not safe for

fire !
thank you for the care of his majesty' s soldiers .

yes , sir .
fire the house and barns .
let it be known if you harbor the enemy you wiii iose your home .
by order of king george ... ... aii slaves of the american colonies who fight for the crown ... ... wiii be granted their freedom with our victory .
we' re not slaves .
we work this iand .
we' re freedmen .
then you' re freedmen who wiii have the privilege ... ... of fighting in the king' s army .
rebei dispatches , sir .
who carried this ?
who carried this ? !
i did , sir .
i was wounded .
these people gave me care .
they have nothing to do with the dispatches .
take this one to camden .
he is a spy .
hang him , put his body on display .
he' s a dispatch rider .
destroy the iivestock .
save the horses for the dragoons .
colonel , this is a uniformed dispatch rider carrying a marked case .
he cannot be held as a spy .
weil , we won' t hold him .
we' re going to hang him .
colonel  father !
oh , i see .
he' s your son .
perhaps you should' ve taught him something of ioyalty .
colonel , i beg you , please reconsider .
by the rules of war
would you iike a iesson , sir , in the rules of war ?
or perhaps your children would .
no iesson is necessary .
sir .
what of the rebei wounded ?
kiii them .
father .
father , do something !
be quiet !
gabriel , run !
wait !

stupid boy .

it' s a good spot .
boys , iisten to me .
i' ii fire first .
start with the officers and work your way down .
can you teii the difference ?
yes , father .
yes , father .
good .
samuel , after your first shot , reload for nathan .

run as quickly as you can .

then iet him speak .
take your time and teii me .
how many were there ?

were they regulars ?
i don' t reaily remember how many .
maybe one .
one man .
reaily ?
he was in the flank .
aii around us .
amongst us .
i could barely see him .
he was there , then he was gone .
he just vanished .
sounds more iike a ghost than a man .
a ghost .
he was iike a ghost .
enough .
bordon ?
take a patrol .
capture this ghost before word of his exploits spread .
who' s this ?
sir , this is captain wilkins .
he was with the loyalist coloniai militia .
he might be of use .
another colonial .
captain wilkins , where do your ioyalties iie ?
to king and country .
why should i trust a man who' d betray his neighbors ?
those neighbors of mine who stand against england ... ... deserve to die a traitor' s death .
we' ii see .
mr. martin !
miss charlotte !
you' re safe now .
try to sleep .
good night .
good night .
father ?
yes .
i kiiled those men .
you did what i told you to do .
you did what you had to .
there was no wrong in it .
i' m glad i kiiled them .
i' m glad .
get some rest .
you' ve done nothing for which you should be ashamed .
i' ve done nothing .
and for that , i am ashamed .
gates and the continentai army are at hiilsborough .
i' m joining up with them .
no .
your place is here now .
i' m going back .
i' m a soldier , it' s my duty .
your duty is to your family .
don' t you walk away from me , boy !
i' ii find you when it' s over .
no , i forbid you to go !
i' m not a child !
you' re my child !
goodbye , father .
thomas is dead .
how many more have to die before you' ii heed my word ?
i' m iosing my family .
when wiii you be back , father ?
i don' t know .
tomorrow ?
no , not tomorrow .
you say your prayers .
i wiil .
take care of your brothers and sisters and your aunt charlotte .
i' m depending on you .
as i am on you , samuel .
aii right .
susan ... ... goodbye .
thank you .
halt !
make ready !
take aim !
fire !
i' m not going back .
no , i didn' t expect you would .
that gates is a damn fool .
he spent too many years in the british army .
going muzzle to muzzle with redcoats in open field .
it' s madness .
halt !
make ready !
present !
fire !
this battle was over before it began .
retreat !
retreat !
these rustics are so inept .
nearly takes the honor out of victory .
nearly .
hold him firm .
where' s your commanding officer ?
that tent there .
it' s a iost cause .
benjamin martin .
i' m in no mood for a iecture .
where' s your generai gates now ?
the iast anyone saw , riding hard northeast ... ... his staff 1 00 yards behind , trying to catch up .
so who' s in command ?
i am .
i think .
what are my orders ?
we' re a breath away from iosing this war , benjamin .
in the north , washington is reeling from morristown .
he' s running and hiding from 1 2, 000 redcoats .
in the south , cornwailis has broken our back .
captured over 5000 of our troops when he took charles town .
and he destroyed the only army between him and new york .
nothing wiii stop him from heading north to finish off washington .
unless we can keep cornwailis in the south tiii the french arrive .
they' ve promised a fleet and 1 0, 000 troops .
when ?
six months at the earliest .
you trust the french to keep their word ?
absolument .
benjamin martin .
major jean viileneuve .
french seventh light foot .
he wiii help train the militia .
the hero of fort wilderness .
your reputation precedes you .
you reaily expect to hold cornwailis here using just militia ?
not me .
you .
they' re not soldiers , they' re farmers .
they' d be better off ietting the british march through .
they' d be better off , but the cause wouldn' t .
how many men does cornwailis have ?
8000 infantry .
around 600 cavalry .
i' m giving you a field commission as a colonel .
might i request that you transfer my son under my command ?
sir , no , i
that' s done .
thank you .
colonel , i' ve been a soldier for two years .
as a scout , horseman , marksman , scavenger .
is that so ?
i' d be of better use with regulars .
where' d you iearn aii that riding , shooting , scavenging ?
my father taught me .
teach you any humility ?
he tried .
it didn' t take .
he also taught you every traii between here and charles town ... ... which is why he transferred you .
we' ii put the word out .
start on the south side of
we' ii cover more ground if we split up .
very weil , corporal .
you take harrisviile , pembroke , wakefield .
i' ii start on the north side .
meet at the mission in black swamp .
corporal .
be careful .
yes , sir .
you have children ?
french .
it skirts the mountain and then ... ... extends down towards the headwater here ... ... and right across to the far bank of the ohio river .
it' s 1 00, 000 acres .
it' s an imposing iand grant , my iord .
you wiii be a country unto yourself .
his majesty is most generous .
though your service in this war more than warrants such a gift .
yes , this is how his majesty rewards those ... ... who fight for him as gentlemen .
i dare to presume my own meager contributions wiii be rewarded one day .
you may presume too much .
his majesty , iike history , judges us by the outcome of the war ... ... and the manner in which it was fought .
we serve the crown , and we must conduct ourselves accordingly .
surrendering troops wiii be given quarter .
these brutai tactics must stop !
is it not enough that i have never iost a battle ?
you serve me ... ... and the manner in which you serve me reflects upon me !
i would' ve thought that a gentleman from a family as esteemed as yours ... ... would understand that .
my iate father squandered any esteem in which we were held ... ... along with my inheritance .
i advance myself only through victory .
you advance yourself only through my good graces .
these colonials are our brethren .
and when this conflict is over , we wiii reestablish commerce with them .
do you understand , colonel ?
perfectly , my iord .
reverend , with your permission , i' d iike to make an announcement .
young man , this is a house of god .
i understand that , reverend .
i apologize .
the south carolina militia is being cailed up .
i' m here to enlist every man wiiling .
son ... ... we are here to pray ... ... for the souls of those men hanging outside .
yes , pray for them .
but honor them by taking up arms with us .
and bring more suffering to this town ?
if king george can hang those men , he can hang any one of us .
dan scott ... ... barely a week ago you railed for two hours about independence .
mr. hardwick , how many times have i heard you ... ... speak of freedom at my father' s table ?
half the men in this church , including you , father ... ... and you , reverend ... ... are as ardent patriots as i.
wiii you now , when you are needed most , stop at only words ?
is that the sort of men you are ?
i ask only that you act upon the beliefs ... ... of which you have so strongly spoken ... ... and in which you so strongly believe .
who' s with us ?
mr. howard .
sir ... ... may i have permission to write to anne ?
may i have permission to write anne ?
yes .
you have permission ... ... to write me .
oh , write her .
very weil .
thank you , sir .
reverend ?
a shepherd must tend his flock .
and , at times , fight off the wolves .
are you sure this is the right place to recruit for a militia ?
god save king george !
i think we came to the right place .
any bounty ?
no scalp money this time , roilins .
but you can keep or seii me the muskets and gear of any redcoat you kiil .
they hanged my brother down in acworth .
every damned one of them redcoats deserves to die .
sign up .
with aii my ailments ... ... i wouldn' t make it through the first skirmish .
no , sir .
but you can have my negro .
he' ii fight in my stead .
occam !
get over here .
ain' t overly smart .
he' s strong as a buil .
can you write ?
no , no , sir .
weil , then , make your mark .
why ?
i just signed him over to you .
if you' re wiiling , make your mark .
that' ii do .
i' ii kiii me some redcoats .
i believe you would .
how old are you ?
not quite old enough .
but his time wiii come .
john biilings .
i was hoping you' d turn up .
there' s a story going around about 20 redcoats ... ... got kiiled by a ghost or some damn thing .
carried a cherokee tomahawk .
aren' t you a iittle old to be believing in ghost stories ?
how many did you get ?
twelve .
good .
these men , they' re not the sort we need .
they' re exactly the sort we need .
they' ve fought this kind of war before .
what about me ?
am i one of that sort ?
heil , no .
your sort gives that sort a bad name .
i want accuracy and precision .
make ready !
take aim !
fire !
our force continues to grow .
as long as we continue to fight , others will come to fight beside us .
i long to see you and speak to you .
lm hopeful that our duties will bring me nearyou .
until then , i am and will remain most affectionatelyyours .
gabriel .
we surrender !
no !
god , stop !
for the love of god , we
these men were about to surrender !
perhaps .
we wiii never know .
this is murder !
heil , reverend , they' re redcoats .
they' ve earned it .
we' re better than that .
what do you know about war ?
i know the difference between fighting
go back to church !
quiet !
he' s right .
quarter wiii be given to british wounded and any who surrender .
they gave no quarter when they fired on a ship carrying my wife and daughters .
i watched from 200 yards off as they were burned alive .
aii my sympathy , but my order stands .
damn your sympathy .
who are you to give such an order ?
i know what you did to my countrymen at fort wilderness .
we' re militia .
this is not regular army .
every man here is free to come and go as he pleases .
but while you' re here ... ... you wiii obey my command or i wiii have you shot .
damn dogs !
shoot the damn things !
stay that pistol .
they won' t iet you near the wagon .
rum , madeira .
no wonder they were guarding it .
officers ' uniforms .
what you think aii this is worth ?
it' s the personai correspondence of lord cornwailis .
this is his journal .
i say we drink the wine , eat the dogs and use the papers for musket wadding .
eat the dogs ?
dog is a fine meal .
good heavens .
i have some maps here for you .
put them down over there .
thank you .
here .
a proper musket for you .
i don' t know about you , but i don' t iike the idea giving muskets to slaves .
your sense of freedom is as pale as your skin .
don' t iisten to them .
if we win this war , a iot of things wiii change .
what wiii change ?
they caii this the new world .
it' s not .
it' s the same as the old .
but we' ii have a chance to build a new world .
a world where aii men are created equai under god .
equal .
sounds good .
i' ve just been in the mind of a genius .
cornwailis knows more about warfare than we could iearn in a dozen iifetimes .
that' s cheerfui news .
his victories at camden and charles town were perfect .
perfect .
and he knows it , what' s more .
perhaps that' s his weakness .
sir ?
pride .
pride' s a weakness .
personaily , i would prefer stupidity .
pride wiii do .
finished , my iord .
i' ve taken it in at the back ... ... added wider epaulets and iooped gold braiding .
it' s a horse blanket .
i don' t know , my iord .
it' s reaily quite nice .
very nice , my iord .
very weil .
it' s a nice horse blanket .
colonei tavington , why , after six weeks ... ... am i stiii attending a baii in south carolina ... ... when i should be attending bails in north carolina ?
first , the theft of my baggage ... ... including my memoirs , on which i spent countless hours .
then half the bridges and ferries between here and charles town burned .
if you can' t protect our supply iines against militia ... ... how do you intend doing so against the regulars or the french ?
they won' t fight iike regulars .
we can' t find them .
colonel , they' re militia .
they' re farmers with pitchforks !
they' re rather more than that , i' m afraid .
made so by their commander , this ghost .
oh , ghost , ghost , ghost .
you created this ghost , colonel .
your brutality sweiled his ranks .
without them this ghost would' ve disappeared ... ... and i' d be in north carolina by now !
in my defense , my iord
oh , enough , enough !
a fine soldier you are , bested by a bedtime story .
give me the horse blanket .
o' hara , our supply ship appears to have arrived .
yes , my iord , it has .
then why am i stiii wearing this rag ?
your replacement wardrobe is aboard ship , but ... ... colonei tavington thought it best to secure our arms and munitions first .
they are being unloaded .
you iook good in that color .
it stinks .
weil , it' s had a dead man in it .
the beasts took your dogs too ?
yes .
fine animals .
a gift from his majesty .
dead now , for aii i know .
is there no decency ?
oh , fireworks .
lovely !
mr. howard .
i' ve come to caii on anne .
i' ve come to caii on anne !
weil , of course you caii yourself a man .
father , stop it .
you heard him .
weil ... ... caii on her .

yeah , i know .
bundling bags are a wonderfui tradition .
i don' t mind in the ieast .

come , dear .
it' s very good .
i' m pleased that you iike it .
peter .
don' t worry .
i sew better than my mother did .
i hope so .
if you' re just gonna stand there ... ... why don' t you read it for us ?
i can' t read .
i can .
take notice .
by order of generai washington and the continentai congress ... ... aii bound slaves who give minimum one year service ... ... in the continentai army ... ... wiii be granted freedom ... ... and be paid a bounty of five shiilings for each month of service .
did you hear that ?
first they' ii free them , then they' ii pay them .
only another six months .
what wiii you do with freedom ?
i made this for you .
look after your mother .
you know , peter ... ... i can' t pay you for this .
benjamin , you pay me what you can , when you can .
i' m obliged .
gabriei sure reminds me a iot of you .
no , no , he' s more iike his mother .
corporal !
take your time .
dogs .
sir .
this road is closed .
these wagons now belong to the continentai army .

soon my countrymen wiii arrive .
the french army is  to heii with you .
and to heii with the french army .
we don' t need them .
we got benjamin martin .
we know what he done to the french .
father .
men always buy you drinks because of what happened at fort wilderness .
strangers know more about you than i do .
teii me what happened .
your mother asked me that question around about the time you were born .
i was drunk and foolish enough to answer it .
the french and the cherokee had raided along the blue ridge .
the english settlers had sought refuge at fort charles .
by the time we got there , the fort was abandoned .
they' d ieft about a week before .
but what we found was ....
go on .
they' d kiiled aii the settlers , the men .
with the women and ... ... some of the children , they had ....
we buried them ail , what was ieft of them .
we caught up with them at fort wilderness .
we took our time .
we cut them apart slowly .
piece by piece .
i can see their faces .
i can stiii hear their screams .
aii but two .
we iet them iive .
we sent the heads on a pailet ... ... with the two that iived back to fort ambercon .
the eyes , tongues , fingers ... ... we put in baskets .
sent them down the asheulot to the cherokee .
soon after , the cherokee broke their treaty with the french .
that' s how we justified it .
we were ... ... heroes .
and men bought you drinks .
not a day goes by where i don' t ask god' s forgiveness for what i did .
thomas was my brother , as weii as your son .
you may not believe this , but i want satisfaction as much as you do .
but not at the expense of our cause .
there wiii be a time for revenge .
but untii then , stay the course .
your mother said that when i' d get drunk or iose my temper .
she' d say it to me when i picked on thomas .
i miss him .
the british got 1 8 of our men at fort carolina .
they' ii be hung one at a time untii they give up the rest of us .
reverend ... ... can you write a ietter for me ?
to my wife and boy .
yes , of course i wiil .
but first iet us pray .
my lord ... ... there is a rider at the gates .
a civilian carrying a white flag .
i am occupied .
he has a pair of dogs with him .
great danes .
and dearlord ... ... protect us in this , our hour of need .
this we ask in the name of the father , the son ....
and the holy ghost .
wait here .
generai lord cornwailis wiii be with you shortly .
jupiter , mars .
come , boys .
come .
my good boys .
my brave boys .
you seem to be weil fed .
i thank you for that .
i' m afraid i don' t know your name .
i' m a colonei in the continentai army .
my rank should be sufficient for now .
as you wish .
please be seated .
thank you .
would you , as the initiating officer , care to begin ?
i wiil , unless you' d iike to claim aggrieved status .
yes , i would iike to claim aggrieved status .
very weil , sir .
proceed .
you have in your possession belongings of mine including clothing ... ... furniture , personai effects of a non military nature ... ... which i' d iike returned to me .
indeed .
i wiii do so as soon as possible .
thank you .
now we come to the matter of the specific targeting ... ... of officers during engagements .
you must know that in civilized warfare , officers in the field ... ... must not be accorded inappropriate ievels of hostile attention .
to your mind , what are appropriate ievels of hostile attention ?
imagine the chaos that would foilow ... ... from ieaderless armies having at each other .
there must be gentlemen in command to iead ... ... and , where necessary , restrain their men .
restrain them from , say , targeting civilians .
women , children and such .
that' s a separate issue .
no .
i consider them iinked .
and as iong as your soldiers attack civilians ... ... i wiii order the shooting of officers at every engagement .
and my men are exceilent marksmen .
very weil .
now , iet us move on to  prisoner exchange .
sir ?
you have 1 8 of my men .
i want them back .
i do have 1 8 criminals under sentence of death ... ... but i hold no prisoners of war .
if that' s your position , 1 8 of your officers wiii have to die .
nineteen , if you hang me with my men .
my officers ?
sir .
top of the ridge , to your ieft .
below the tree iine .
their names and ranks ?
they refused to give names .
there are 9 iieutenants , 5 captains , 3 majors ... ... and one fat colonei who cailed me ... ... a cheeky feilow .
this is not the conduct of a gentleman .
if the conduct of your officers is the measure of a gentleman ... ... i' ii take that as a compliment .
get my men .
arrange the exchange .
my iord .
thank you , sir .
release the prisoners !
what is this ?
prisoner exchange .
he has 1 8 of our officers .
who is he ?
i recognize him .
he' s the commander of the militia .
your ghost .
stay that sword , colonel !
he rode in under a white flag for formai parley .
this is madness .
if you harm him , you condemn our officers .
with respect , sir , he' s kiiled as many officers in the iast two months .
he has shown no aggression here .
hence he cannot be touched .
has he not ?
you !
so you' re the ghost , are you ?
i remember you !
on that farm !
that stupid iittle boy !
did he die ?
you know ... ... it' s an ugly business , doing one' s duty .
but just occasionaily ... ... it' s a reai pleasure .
before this war is over , i' m going to kiii you .
why wait ?
soon .
move out !
but i stiii think it' s imperative to push north .
one of our captured officers , my iord .
my reputation suffers because ofyourincompetence !
that man insults me !
quite impressive for a farmer with a pitchfork , wouldn' t you say ?
i want you to find that man .
i want you to capture him .
the man has the ioyalty of the people .
they protect him .
protect his family .
protect the families of his men .
i can capture him for you .
but to do so requires the use of tactics that are somewhat ....
what was the word your iordship used ?
brutal , " i think .
go on .
i am prepared to do what is necessary .
i alone wiii assume the fuii mantle of responsibility for my actions ... ... free of the chain of command ... ... rendering you blameless .
however ... ... if i do this ... ... you and i both know that i can never return to england with honor .
what , i wonder , is to become of me ?
when this war is over here in the colonies ... ... the new aristocracy ... ... wiii be iandowners .
teii me about ohio .

he' s burning our homes ... ... kiiling whomever resists .

benjamin , nothing wiii replace your sons .
but if you come with us , you can justify their sacrifice .
why ?
why do men feei they can justify death ?
is it arrogance or ... ?
i have iong feared ... ... that my sins would return to visit me .
and the cost is more than i can bear .
benjamin , we have a chance .
greene and dan morgan are down from virginia .
if we win this next battle , victory in the war is within our grasp .
go , then .
seek your victory .
i' m smaii issue to it .
you' re wrong , benjamin .
you matter to your men ... ... and to others as weil .

stay with us .
stay the course .
i have run my course .
you men wiii be ieaving with us .
prepare the baggage .
jean .
tomorrow' s battle can alter the course of the war .
generai greene , what exactly is the task before us ?
gentlemen , cornwailis has us cornered .
not only does he outnumber us ... ... but nearly half of our force is militia .
unreliable , at best .
excuse me , sir .
you underestimate our militia .
aii of you do .
we' ve seen our militia iines break time and again .
kips bay , princeton .
but the british have seen that too .
cornwailis ' own ietters bear out that he has no respect for the militia .
what are you suggesting , ben ?
i' m suggesting we use that .
i know you men have sacrificed a iot so far .
but aii i' m asking is that you ... ... iet the front iine of the militia fire two shots tomorrow .
a iot can happen in the time it takes to fire two shots .
especiaily against british regulars .
indeed .
that' s why i' m not asking you to fire three .
if i die , i wiii die weil dressed .
fire !
battalion !
company , halt !
harry ... ... wiii you give this to my children ?
thank you .
it' s october now .

i' m honored to have you with us .
honored .
shoulder arms !

how old were your daughters ?
violette was 1 2 and pauline , 1 0 .
they had green eyes .
i' m sure they were iovely .
yes , they were .

artiilery , concentrate on the center .
if we reform and wheei right , we may be able to turn their flank .
you dream , general .
kiii me before the war is over , wiii you ?
it appears you are not ... ... the better man .
you' re right .
my sons were better men .
sound the retreat .
sound ... ... retreat .
the warhas turned .
general cornwallis took flight with his army and moved north .
we continued to engage the british , and in the following months ... ... cornwallis entrenched himself at yorktown , virginia .
washington escaped from the north ... ... and surrounded cornwallis , who could not retreat to the seas .
it was blocked offby ourlong lost friends ... ... who had finally arrived .
vive la france .
vive la libert .
my iord , i beseech you .
you must order the surrender .
how could it come to this ?
an army of rabble .
peasants .
everything wiii change .
everything has changed .
though he eventually surrendered ... ... cornwallis himselfhid in shame ... ... appointing his subordinate to relinquish his sword .
with the war ending , and ourmilitia disbanding ... ... l take measure of what we have lost ... ... and what we have won .
my hope and prayeris that the sacrifices borne by so many ... ... will spawn and fulfill the promise of ournew nation .
tell the children , and especially susan , that i will keep mypromise ... ... as i will be returning to you all soon .
where wiii you go now ?
home .
start over .
your wife' s expecting a child , isn' t she ?
she gave birth to a son three weeks ago .
what' d you name him ?
we named him gabriel .
thank you , harry .
gabriei is a good name for a farmer .
it is .
it is .
jean .
ben .
gabriei said if we won the war ... ... we could build a whole new world .
just figured we' d get started right here ... ... with your home .
sounds good .
thank you .
