to dean of admissions , princeton university .
the most influential person in my life ... ... is mother teresa , whose example helped me overcome the arrogance ... which threatened after my 1, 600 sat score and national merit scholarship .
my influential person taught me the most important word i' ve learned .
aloha , which i ...
to the dean of admissions , princeton university ... from cristina moreno .
my mother .
no contest .
i think i have been pointing toward this essay ... ever since the day , 12 years ago in mexico , when my father left .
such was my mother' s need to protect me ... that she would not let me see her cry .
the trick was ... get over it as quickly and privately as possible .
such was my need to protect her ... that i never let on that i could hear her .
my mother kept us in mexico as long as possible ... to root me in all things latin .
finally , she sensed our last opportunity for change .
we would leave for america .
one tear .
just one .
so make it a good one , " she said .
she would be my mexico .
because this admissions essay is open record ...
let me just say that our transportation into the united states was ... economy class .
in order to raise me properly ... my mother needed as much of the security of her own culture as possible .
so we rolled through texas ... just 34 % hispanic ... to los angeles ... 48 % hispanic . ... look at the detroit pistons .
and your mother' s saying , " get up !
but , no , what of it ?
you can' t see them .
why ?
' cause you' re being killed ... you' re being strangled by the psychotic raider fans .
what do you have in oakland ?
you got a bunch of psychotic ...
a few minutes adrift in an alien environment ... then we turned a corner , and we were right back home .
my mother' s favorite cousin , monica , gave us shelter .
for the next six years ... neither of us ventured outside our new community .
mom worked two jobs , paying a total of $450 a week ... each of us doing everything we could to make things work .
we were safe and happy .
if only i could have stayed six .
but i was blossoming .
and during my very first dance ... in the time it took a boy' s hand ... to go from my back to my bottom ... it was evident that she would have to leave her night job ... to keep a watchful eye on me .
within days , she was on her way to a job interview .
she needed $450 from one job .
and that meant , after all her time in america ... finally entering a foreign land .
hello ?
yeah , hi .
we' re here for the interview with mrs. clasky ?
oh , great .
you made it .
come on in .
the front door' s open and we' re out back .
okay ?
and call me deborah .
holding out had helped though .
she was no longer intimidated .
working for anglos now posed no problems .
it would just be a job .
white america beckoned .
she stepped across the cultural divide .
gee whiz in heaven , are you okay ?
no .
don' t worry , i' m not mad .
i' ve been looking for decoration to put up on the glass so people wouldn' t walk into it .
instead of taking what was in stock , which was awful , i special ordered ... but i' il design something myself , which i should' ve done ...
what does that matter when your nose is bleeding ?
shut up , deborah .
now you got it , mom .
there' s no ice pack , bern !
so get anything frozen .
pressure !
just pressure !
take this .
is it strange that i just gave you money ?
i just felt really badly .
it' s okay .
chum , knock it off !
i' m sorry about the way the place looks .
i' m hosting a fundraiser for the school tonight .
it' s just a mess .
come sit right here .
here you go .
yeah , just ...
that' s great .
just toss it .
she' s my cousin .
she' s been here for a while and she understands some , but doesn' t really ... speak english , but , anyway ...
she lives in the apartment i manage and ...
so who am i interviewing ?
her .
you' re gorgeous .
she didn' t mean it as a compliment .
it' s more of an accusation .
mother !
go ahead .
i' m sorry .
this is my daughter , bernie ...
and my mother , evelyn wright .
evelyn .
do you want to come in out of the sun ?
no , we' re fine .
you need some sunscreen ?
i got a 70 here .
she loves the sun .
look , we' re wearing the same sweater .
that' s good booga booga .
you want some lemonade , maybe ?
lemonade , please ?
would you like to take some ?
both of you ?
okay , let' s just talk .
i have two children .
my husband is a top chef .
like that makes me something .
anyway , he works nights , so ...
do you work ?
yes .
no .
not right now .
why ?
how do you know to ask that ?
it' s okay .
i can talk about it .
i just ...
i ran a commercial design company until four months ago ... when it was downsized to zip .
now i' m a full time mom .
gulp !
double gulp .
i have two children .
my son georgie is nine , bernie you know ... and i like the house to be like me , you know ...
i' m very loose and meticulous at the same time .
it' s all about first names and closeness here .
let her know , absolutely .
but i do care about the place .
i' m so sorry , i' m not leaving you time to translate .

flor .
flor .
flor !
is there some school of the ear i' m flunking out off right now ?
what' d she say ?
she says if you curl your tongue , then let it be loose , you' il get it ... and that it' s really hard for americans ... and that it' s great you try so hard .
because most people wouldn' t bother .
she gets me .
flor .
dense , but stubborn , right ?
now , see what you just did for me ?
that is just what the kids need .
patience and encouragement .
all right , money .
goodbye .
look forward to seeing you .
love you .
the job is six days a week .
seven , eight , 12 hours , it depends .
all the housekeeping , driving the kids .
how much a week do you want ?
whatever you say .
no !
no .
this is a very important question ... because if you ask for too little , it means you don' t value yourself .
you ask for too much , it means you' re taking advantage .
so ?
$1, 000 .
she' s kidding !
$650 !
welcome to the family .
come on .
i want to show you around .
come on !
i had never known that my mother had been chronically worried about money ... until the first glimpse of her as financially unburdened .

is this good ?
gracias .
you' re welcome .
here you go .
enjoy .
gracias .

she said , " who do you think you are ?
she' s with her daughter , for god' s sake .
her young daughter .
passing on the left !

you don' t have to get up yet , but are you thinking seriously about it ?
yes .

a simple " it' s good " will do .
i' m glad you like it .
but you could do without this .
no !
flor , never do fetch to chum !

i' m not mad .
i' m thinking of you .

no , i' m not mad .
good guy ... bad guy .
come on .
what the hell are you doing ?
everything' s okay .
john .
yes .
do you really think that cupping my breast ...
is going to solve the issue here ?
it' s worked before .
now it' s infuriating me .
wrong breast .
oh , my god !
no , i know what you mean .
oh , my god .
don' t do the calm thing .
just don' t go there .
don' t do that thing .
this is very important to you .
us .
i just like to level with georgie .
that' s why i answered him this way .
this is not an argument , honey .
yes , it is !
we' re having a fight , john .
a big fight , at last .
so could you stop being so stark raving calm ?
great god in heaven , save me .
hi .
i didn' t know deb found somebody .
you work here ?
you' re gonna help out with the house and kids ?
you work here and you don' t speak any english at all ?
all she has to do is dial 911 and press two for spanish .
this is ...

john , this is flor .
flor .

i don' t need a walk .
i' il walk with you .
i know a breathing thing .
what do you think i' m worried about ?
how i' m gonna cook ?
that' s not the thing .
that' s not the problem .
i worked at a restaurant in new york that had four stars .
it was like a line formed to become an asshole .
people' s accents changed .
the heart went out of the place .
you understand ?
no .
i agree with everything you just said .
i admire you for your feelings .
i hope to adopt them as my own .
here we are , ladies .
i don' t know what to root for .
the thought of one star gets me nauseous ... but with four , there' s no place to go but , " my god , they took away one of my stars !
the times liked the first course .
you know what you want ?
three and a quarter stars .
yes , that would be perfect .
it' d mean you' re good , but not good enough to feel disappointed ... you just missed out on excellence .
you still get enough respect .
good people wanna work with you .
business is good , not crazy .
you' re right below the radar , where you get to mind your own business .
that' s a good , solid life .
big wipe .
i' m in the vitamin section and this little hip hop girl , what' s her name ?
nice surprise , thank you .

hoover .
i said i had it .
you don' t trust me ?
okay .
i no longer know nothing .
and hoover was followed in office by ...
i' m just drawing blanks .
i' m embarrassed .
it' s my own fault .
i spent all my time on math , which i' m lucky if i don' t flunk , anyway .
stop it .
the man you' re looking for is not a ruse .
what does " ruse " mean ?
phony .
roosevelt !
if i' d ever heard of that word before , that would lock it in .
surprise !
new clothes .

what did i do right ?
it was a warehouse sale .

she needed a boost .
that came together .

bernie , come on .

what' s going on ?
you' re gonna do it , and you' re gonna look beautiful .
honey , i just ...
you are going to lose that weight , and ...
you know ...
i' m glad you didn' t get here earlier , because ... then i wouldn' t be able to tell you that ... your gift to me ... is a ruse .
honey , i ...
please , just excuse me .
hey , bernie ...
i just ...
i just need to be alone right now , okay ?
i' m sorry .
it' s okay .
we have to be able to endure this , john , if we' re gonna help her .
i' il just gonna hang out here and wait for you , okay ?
her pediatrician intervened on his own daughter' s weight , and she is an 8 .
dad , don' t .
didn' t you ever just need a minute ?
yes .
this is the same page that i' m talking about , john .
we gotta be on the same page .
that' s the most important thing .
i don' t know why it has to be so hard .
i need a minute .
she' s right between the two sizes .
i thought about it .
what am i supposed to do ?
encourage her denial ... or motivate her to get herself in shape ?
flor ?
me go .
okay .
i' il take you to the bus stop .
sorry , i didn' t even help you with the door .
no , what i meant was ...
my mother did not understand her male boss .
he seemed as upset as she was over what had been done to bernice ...
shit ! ... and yet had done nothing .
i am running out of excuses for the lady of the house !
but , man , bernice' s final is tomorrow .
she didn' t need this one .
and just the look on her face when she got the gifts !
like for one second she thought ... all her problems with her mother had been solved !
he appeared to be a good man ... but to someone with first hand knowledge of latin macho ... he seemed to have the emotions of a mexican woman .
she had no idea of how to react , except to flee .
what' re you doing ?
we' re still moving .
i' il take you all the way to the bus stop .
you got to let me take you all the way .
i' il take you .
all the way .
how weird was this ride ?
sorry .
i' m sorry .
yes , you are released .
yes .
bye bye .
a simple request from my mother startled me .
her rules were bending .
she was losing her battle to remain uninvolved with the claskys .
try it on .
try ...
just .
just try it on .
just try on .
just .
just .
there is one particular cultural difference ... which i wish to explore academically at princeton .
american women , i believe ... actually feel the same as hispanic women about weight .
a desire for the comfort of fullness .
and when that desire is suppressed for style ... and deprivation allowed to rule ... dieting , exercising american women ...
left ! ... become afraid of everything associated with being curvaceous ... such as wantonness , lustfulness ...
left ! ... sex , food ... motherhood .
all that is best in life .
wow !
taste , she has .
just try it on .
when did you learn to speak english ?
just try it on .
it' s too tight .
it doesn' t fit .
bernice , just try it on .
it' s too small .
i' m too big .
just try it on !
okay .
i' il show you .
thanks .
lovely way to start the day .
the world' s most trim mexican learns her first sentence ... and uses it to watch me grunt my way ... into a ...
it fits !
okay .
no .
thanks .
whatever happened to frre jacques or itsy bitsy spider ?
make room .
i know .
but every time he has a nightmare , i teach him one of my old songs .
that way , his nightmares have a purpose .
but i don' t have to sing it for anyone .
right , you' re clear on that .
how many did you sell of this song , grandma ?
he likes to know that stuff .
she was huge .
here goes .
76, 000 , which is great for a jazz album .
jesus .
fuck you .
dad !
for christ' s sake , why are you screaming ?
why , crazy father , why aren' t you screaming ?
i' m working on it .
the stunned thing has to get dealt with .
john clasky ...
no .
yes .
john clasky , who , at 25 ...
made his mark on the new york restaurant scene ...
has re emerged as a young and confident veteran ...
taking chances with his combinations ...
dad .
your sister' s talking .
... beginning with a succession of appetizers ...
is constantly yet casually daring .
dad , this is so great .
oh , my god .
i think , here it is .
eating at this perfect , smaller , passionate restaurant ...
inspires one' s own abandonment of caution .
to wit ...
john clasky is the best chef in the united states .
look how great you read it .
perfect , dad .
john , four stars .
oh , my god .
you even look different to me .
i wonder what mom will do ?
i read it !

i don' t know .
i' m just so happy for you and all your hard work .
oh , my goodness .
all right .
don' t worry .
i' il wait for you .

ladies and gentlemen , the mother of two children !

pietro , what' s wrong ?
i got a fantastic offer for my own place .
everyone wants to back me since the paper came out .
i can' t lose you and keep the hours i' m keeping .
i can' t do my life unless i hold onto you .
i think i just gave you an incredible bargaining position .
so you gave away 20 % of the restaurant ... without even talking to me about it ?
i had to , right then , or i would have lost him .
then i wouldn' t have enough time with the family .
i don' t exist .
sure you do .
i was all worried , just trying to figure out the timing to talk to you ... about renting a place for the summer .
i think you have your timing .
mom , the realtor' s here .

hi .
i' ve rented a house for the summer ... and she needs to sleep at the house because of the bus schedule .

a whole daughter you' ve never mentioned ?
this is a little crazy that i don' t know this .
no , don' t translate asides .
she said she can' t live here .
because her daughter ...
i got that .
her daughter can also live here for the summer .
go , tell her that .
deborah , if she didn' t tell us about her child ... she has to have a deep sense of privacy .
we can figure out how she can still live at home .
hell , i don' t mind driving her at night .
let' s spare the world you on the roads , okay ?
what am i gonna do ?
i' m sorry , my friend , but this is what i need .

thank you so much .
i' m thrilled to be here .
okay , here' s the idea .
i need to make a serving platter for serving fish out of sea glass like this .

so here' s the deal .
you guys go hunting for it .
i' il give you 50 cents for any piece you find .

thanks .
deb made a mistake .
i understand how you feel .
do you understand what i' m saying right now , at all ?
no .
good .
is simptico the word ?
uno momento .
that' s italian .
i really am sorry that this is happening .
i wanted you to know that .
i really .
so sorry .
truly .
i didn' t mean like ...
i meant just a normal sorry .
so , i' m going to go to work .
thank you so much .
thank you so much for taking me there .
stop thanking me .
i really enjoyed having the company .
the flea market was just ...
i don' t know what to say .
it was just ... so many things .
and you .
you knew so much about all of them .
the way you made those people lower the prices , though .
i just think that you' re ...
never mind .
no , go ahead .
i can take it .
i just think that you' re ... the most amazing white woman that i' ve ever met .
that is so nice to hear .
absurd , but deeply appreciated , cristina .
oh , my gosh .
thank you so much .
that was so fun .
this was the best day ever .
what ?
did something bad happen ?
cristina , tell your mother those wash right out .
it' s no big deal .
not right now .
what ?
you can' t just take someone else' s kid and then make them over .
don' t go there .
or i' il go there , and you know where " there " is .
can you believe what a big deal flor is making this into ?
please , shoot me if i ever become that hard to deal with .
what' s this ?
for you .
from ?
look , you are not yourself .
this was written in anger .
will you hold on ?
sleep on it .
you still want me to have it , that' s fine .
take the letter .
i don' t think that you will , once calm and rational thought returns .
take the letter , deborah .
just sleep on it .
she didn' t even want us to know she had a daughter ... and on the first day you take her kid away without even asking ?
i think that' s a little ...
what ?
insensitive ?
elitist ?
narcissistic ?
irresponsible ?
perverse ?
dizzy ?
what ?
stupid .
when is anyone in this damn house ... in this damn life gonna consider my feelings ?
i tried to make a lovely kid feel welcome .
there is no reason to rake this over .
i let it go and gave flor the room to let it go , which i' m sure she has .
it' s over , so just get on board , pal .
i slept .
well , i' m broke .
no , please .
don' t worry about it .
you really don' t have to pay me .
please , don' t worry about it .
i' m just kidding .
when you count it up , give me a holler .
i did count .
many times .
i didn' t sleep .
i counted .
all right , what do i owe you ?
give it to me .
$640 .
really ?
yes .
i' m really sorry .
no .
all right .
i don' t know .
how about we figure this out tomorrow , okay ?
you even told me , you said that $5 ...
i know , i promised .
it' s all coming back to me now .
let me just go deal with this .
