are you alive ?
yes .
prove it .
it has begun .
make a hole !
as i was saying , form follows function .
nowhere is this axiom of design more readily apparent ... than on board the world famous battlestar galactica .
this ship , the last of her kind still in service ... was constructed over 50 years ago during the early days of the cylon war .
originally there were 1 2 battlestars , each representing one of kobol' s 1 2 colonies .
galactica represented caprica and was first commanded by commander nash
the cylon war is long over , yet we must not forget the reasons why
commander adama , if i may ?
captain .
i just wanted to say what a pleasure it' s been serving with you in your command .
captain kelly , it' s been my honour .
good luck in your next assignment .
thankyou , sir .
" the cylon war is long over , yet " good morning , sir .
good morning , starbuck .
what do you hear ?
nothing but the rain .
grab your gun and bring in the cat .
boom , boom , boom .
attention .
honour guard detail ... report to star board hangar bay for ceremonial brief in gandrehearsal .
let' s go , guys .
chief' s gonna have our ass .
yeah , well , you' re the one that was supposed to wrap that yesterday .
shh .
it' s the old man .
too late .
what' s up ?
nothing , sir . just another leak in that " frakkin " ' window .
pardon me , sir .
it' s supposed to be a battlestar , not a museum .
sorry for saying so , sir .
couldn' t agree with you more .
be careful out there , all right ?
the cylon war is long over , yet we cannot forget the reasons why
morning , sir .
good morning .
com traffic from the midwatch .
hmm .
anything interesting ?
mostly housekeeping .
uh , there was one odd message we were copied on .
the one from fleet headquarters there , sir .
courier officers overdue coming back from armistice station .
they' ve asked for a full status report on all f. t. l. capable ships ... just in case they need somebody to jump out there today see if his ship has any mechanical problems .
i think we' re a little bit busy today .
wouldn' t you say so , lieutenant ?
yes , sir .
i' m glad we agree .
and may i take this opportunity to say that it' s been both a pleasure ... and an honour to serve under you these past three years .
it' s my honour , lieutenant gaeta .
the cylon war is long over
colonel ?
you' il see things here that look odd or even antiquated
hello .
antiquated to modern eyes .
phones with cords , awkward manual valves ... computers that barely deserve the name .
it was all designed to operate against an enemy ... who could infiltrate and disrupt even the most basic computer systems .
galactica is a reminder of a time when we were so frightened by our enemies ... that we literally looked backward for protection .
attention all hands
morning .
attention on deck !
chief .
at ease .
sir .
this way .
a mark two .
haven' t seen one of these in about 20 years .
if the commander will take a closer look ... at the tail numbering .
nebula 7242 constellation .
oh , my god .
where did you find her ?
rusting out in a salvage yard on sagittarian .
we had hoped the commander would allow her to participate in the decommissioning ceremony .
she' il fly ?
oh , yes , sir .
ah .
we' ve restored the engines ... patched the guidance system , replaced much of the flight control
you guys are amazing .
she' s fuelled , armed ...
ready for launch , sir .
commander .
what ?
more ?
mm hmm .
somebody' s bucking for a promotion around here .
i believe that would be prosna , sir .
he found this in the fleet archives .
he was doing some research for the museum .
thank you .
thank you all .
it' s an honour .
you' re welcome , sir .
fall out .
all right .
you heard the man .
let' s get number three up .
attention .
prior to 2300 hours .
uh oh .
here we go .
ifyou' re gonna play with the big dogs
no fear .
i' m in .
bet' s to you , x. o.
i' m in .
i' m not scared of you .
oh , helo .
when are you gonna learn ?
first you' re flying with rooks , and then
hey !
ow !
and then you' re betting against starbuck .
starbuck . " now there' s a callsign .
starbuck .
starbuck , buck , buck , buck , buck , buck , buck , buck .
where' d you get that nickname , anyway ?
was that before you were thrown in the brink as a cadet for drunk and disorderly or after ?
after .
after .
that' s right .
it was after .
i' m in .
bet' s to you , x. o.
i' m in .
stay .
how' s the wife ?
too early forthat kind of money .
hey , did you hear about that pyramid game on geminon ?
what were you doing on geminon ?
this girl there i know .
what girl don' t you know ?
the wife is just fine .
talk to her lately ?
bet' s to you , lieutenant .
all right .
thirty to me .
and it looks like i' m gonna bring this lovely little game to a close ... because ... full colours !
ha ha ! ah whoo !
ow !
ow !
stop !
okay , i' m fine .
i' m fine .
hey , hey , hey .
okay .
hey .
you have finally gone too far ... and now you' re done .
lieutenant , consider yourself under arrest , pending charges .
report to the brig .
gentlemen .
are you really gonna press charges against kara ?
for striking a superior officer ?
you' re damned right i am .
heard you started the day off pretty early .
i wasn' t on duty .
now , where did you get this ?
tyrol' s deck gang scrounged it up .
i couldn' t talk you out of it , could i ?
not a chance .
she is insubordinate , undisciplined .
probably one of the finest fighter pilots i' ve ever seen in my life .
yeah .
she' s better than i am .
twice as good as you .
like hell .
jesus .
listen , i' m not gonna defend what she did .
that' s because of the cracks about your marital problems .
but you did kick over the table first .
i did not .
unless i did .
you did .
so what do you say we just drop the formal charges ... throw her in the brig , cool her heels off until we get home ?
you always did have a soft spot for her .
yeah , i guess i' m just a crazy old man .
i' m afraid the tests are positive .
the mass is malignant .
it' s advanced well beyond the  [ loudrumbling ]
so i also sent the president a copy of your speech for galactica' s retirement .
hopefully , he' il have a chance to review it ... but there is a 30 minute time delay between the galactica and
excuse me .
ladies and gentlemen , this is your captain .
welcome aboard .
we are en route to galactica ... and our estimated flight time is approximately five and a half hours .
please sit back and relax and enjoy your flight .
i' il take two !
allright .
how small they are .
i know .
but they grow up so fast .
may i ?
sure .
there .
so light .
so fragile .
shh , shh , shh , shh .
there , there .
it' s okay .
you' re not gonna have to cry much longer .
we really should be going .
of course .
it' s amazing how the neck can support that much weight .
chantara .
honey .
let' s go .
i gotta show you something .
okay .
yeah .
come on .
give me a moment .
just a second .
i' il go with you .
my god !
he' s not breathing !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
he' s not breathing !
my baby !
for those of you just joining us from the pyramid game on geminon ... welcome to the spotlight ... our weekly interview programme devoted to people making news on caprica .
today we' re talking with dr gaius baltar ... winner of three magnate awards over the course of his career .
a media cult figure and a personal friend of president adar' s ... he is currently working as a top consultant for the ministry of defence ... on computer issues .
but he' s perhaps best known for his controversial views ... on advancing computer technology .
dr baltar , again , welcome .
thank you , kellan .
firstly , may i say how lovely you' re looking ... and secondly , what an absolute pleasure it is to be on the show .
well , we' re delighted to have you with us .
could you summarise your views for our audience ?
yes , i' d be happy to .
my position is very simple .
the ban on research and development into artificial intelligence ... is , as we allknow , a holdoverfrom the cylon wars .
quite frankly , i find this to be an outmoded concept .
it serves no useful purpose except to impede our efforts [ moaning ]
miss me ?
can' t you tell ?
your body misses me , but what about your heart , your soul ?
yeah , those too .
do you love me , gaius ?
what ?
do you love me ?
are you serious ?
you had me worried there for a minute .
i' m hot , gaius .
i' m so hot !
viper 450 , this is galactica .
approach port landing bay .
hands on , speed 105 .
checkers red .
call the ball .
galactica , this is viper 450 .
check that .
did you say hands on approach ?
viper 450 , that' s affirmative .
hands on approach .
copy that , galactica .
port landing bay , hands on approach .
speed 105 .
i have the ball .
skids down .
mag lock secure .
on behalf of galactica , i' d like to welcome you aboard , apollo .
it' s an honour to have you with us .
morning , sir .
chieftyrol .
i' il be your crew chief while you' re aboard .
morning , chief .
captain lee adama .
it' s a real pleasure to ... meet you , sir .
i' m sure you' ve heard this before .
i' m a great admirer of your father' s .
the service is gonna miss him when he retires .
well , i' m sure someone will .
is your auto landing system down ?
i was hands on for the whole approach .
it' s all hands on here , captain .
there are no auto landings on the galactica .
commander adama' s orders .
is that right ?
attention in the port hangarbay .
raptor touching down .
clear .
projector is ready .
nice flying , lieutenant .
i think they heard that clear up to the bridge .
yeah .
i' m gonna catch hell from the l. s. o. , but it wasn' t entirely my fault .
primary gimbal' s acting up again .
oh , it' s the gimbal' s fault again ?
helo , am i lying ?
gimbal looked bad to me .
i' ve pulled that gimbal three times and stripped it twice .
the gimbal' s not the problem , sir .
you' re not listening to me , chief .
i listen very closely to what each andevery one of my pilots has to say .
you' re not the one out there trying to bring in 50 tons of raptor ... onto a moving hangar deck with a bad gimbal .
i' ve got 1 0 years experience ...
here we go . breaking down and stripping every component and every system [ together ]
that' s ever been installed in every spacecraft on my hangar deck .
the gimbal is broken .
shut up , sir .
morning .
morning , sir !
all right .
today is the main event .
we have a formation demonstration , fly by manoeuvres ... in conjunction with the decommissioning ceremony .
i' ve got a few changes to the flight plan .
lieutenant thrace is being replaced in the slot by lieutenant anders .
also , we have captain lee adama joining us ... andhe' sgonna be flying lead during the fly by , so please welcome captain .
good to have you .
welcome , apollo .
welcome aboard , captain .
great .
welcome .
thanks to chief tyrol and his deck gang , captain ... you' re gonna have the honour of flying the actual viper ... that your father flew almost 40 years ago .
great .
that' s , um that' s quite an honour .
yes , it is , captain .
and personally i can' t think of a better way to send this ship into retirement .
working close to 95 % efficiency throughout the fleet .
hold your applause , please .
no applause for me ?
i doubt you would' ve ever completed the project without me .
yes , well , you helped a bit .
i rewrote half your algorithms .
all right , you were extremely helpful .
but let' s not forget you got something out of it .
all that poking around inside the defence main frame .
should give you a huge advantage bidding for the contract next year .
you know that' s not really why i did it .
no , you did it ' cause you love me .
that , and god wanted me to help you .
right .
he spoke to you , did he ?
you had a chat ?
he didn' t speak to me in a literal voice .
and you don' t have to mock my faith .
sorry .
i' m just not very religious .
does it bother you that i am ?
it puzzles me that an intelligent , attractive woman such as yourself ... should be taken in by all that mysticism and superstition .
but i' m willing to overlook it on account of your other attributes .
i have to go .
i' m meeting someone .
really ?
who is he ?
i' m insanely jealous .
i doubt that .
so touchy today .
well , as a matter of fact , i' m meeting someone too .
business .
a new project at defence i might do .
so , uh ... you' il call me later , right ?
it' s about time .
i wondered when you' d get here .
secretary roslin .
yes .
mr " kickay . " keikeya .
oh , sorry .
hi .
hi .
my name' s aaron doral .
i' m from public relations .
i' d like to welcome you aboard galactica .
thankyou .
if you' il follow me , i' il show you to your quarters .
attention all hands .
at this time , galactica would like to welcome aboard ... the secretary of education , laura roslin .
the secretary is a member of the president' s cabinet .
we' re honoured by her presence aboard our ship ... and her participation this afternoon in galactica' s decommissioning ceremony .
madam secretary ?
madam secretary ?
yes , that' s exactly what i would think .
attention all hands .
e. v. a. activity on hull .
do not radiate any electrical equipment while e. v. a. is inprogress .
thank you .
in or out .
excuse me ?
get in or get out .
shut the hatch .
sorry .
where are you trying to be ?
uh , visitor' s quarters .
i' m a visitor .
yeah .
never would' ve guessed .
it tells people things like where the restroom is .
it' s an integrated computer network , and i will not have it aboard this ship .
i heard you' re one of those people .
you' re actually afraid of computers .
no .
there are many computers on this ship , but they' re not networked .
a computerised network would simply make it faster and easier for the teachers to be able to teach
let me explain something to you .
many good men and women lost their lives aboard this ship ... because someone wanted a faster computer to make life easier .
i' m sorry that i' m inconveniencing you or the teachers ... but i will not allow a network computerised system ... to be placed on this ship while i' m in command .
is that clear ?
yes , sir .
thankyou .
excuse me .
this seems familiar .
captain adama , sir .
sorry i wasn' t there to greet you with the rest of the squadron .
did they kiss your ass to your satisfaction ?
so , what' s the charge this time ?
striking a superior asshole .
ah .
i bet you' ve been waiting all day to say that one .
most of the afternoon , yeah .
right .
so , how long' s it been ?
two years .
two years .
we must be getting old .
seems like the funeral was just a couple months ago .
yeah .
your old man' s doin ' fine .
we don' t talk about it much .
maybe two or three times a year .
he still struggles with it , though .
i haven' t seen him .
why not ?
kara , don' t even start .
how long are you gonna do this ?
i' m not doing anything .
he lost his son , lee .
and who' s responsible for that ?
same old lee .
you haven' t changed either .
zak was my brother .
what was he to me ?
nothin ' ?
that' s not what i meant .
and you know what
you know what ?
you should go .
i' m gettin ' the urge to hit another superior asshole .
gaius .
gaius !
what are you doing here ?
who the hell are you ?
get out .
gaius , who is this woman ?
uh , she' s a friend .
well , more than a friend .
when i say friend
get out .
this is just great .
bye .
look , it' s , uh it' s me , all right ?
lt lt it' s totally me .
i screwed up .
i am screwed up .
i always have been .
it' s a , uh it' s a flaw in my character that i have .
i' ve always hated it and i' ve tried  spare me your feigned ... self awareness and remorse .
i came here because i have something to tell you .
oh , here he is .
if you' d just like to
a little space .
captain , thankyou for joining us .
hi .
aaron doral .
if you' d just like to stand up there , we' il get a few shots ofyou ... and the commander .
thanks .
hello , captain .
great .
okay , gentlemen , could you maybe stand a bit closer ?
fantastic .
um , commander ... could you put your arm around your son ?
great .
perfect .
okay .
thank you very much .
um , see you at the ceremony .
we' il just be leaving this through this door way and to our right .
attention , honour guard detail , report to starboard hangarbay .
you want some , uh , coffee ?
no , sir .
thankyou , sir .
why don' t you sit down ?
congratulations on making captain .
sorry i wasn' t there .
thankyou , sir .
how' s your mother ?
getting married .
good for her .
we spoke about a year ago .
had a real heart to heart .
it was good .
i' m glad to hear that , sir .
will that be all ?
why don' t you talk to me , lee ?
what do you want to talk about ?
anything .
you' ve been here for an hour .
well , i don' t have anything to say .
my orders said report here and participate in the ceremony .
so i' m i' m here , and i' m gonna participate in the ceremony .
there wasn' t anything in my orders about having any heart to heart chats with the old man .
accidents happen in the service .
dad , listen , i
you know all the things that you talked to me about at the funeral  i really don' t want to do this !
they still ring in my ears after two years .
good !
good .
' cause ' cause you know what ?
they were meant to .
zak had a choice .
you both did .
a man isn' t a man until he wears the wings ofa viper pilot .
doesn' t that sound at all familiar to you ?
that' s not fair , son .
no , it' s not fair .
because one of us wasn' t cut out to wear the uniform .
he earned his wings , just like we alldid .
one of us wasn' t cut out to be a pilot .
one of us wouldn' t have made it into flight school ... if his old man , his daddy , hadn' t pulled the strings !
that' s an exaggeration .
i did nothing for him that i wouldn' t have done for anyone else .
you' re not even listening to me .
wh why can' t you get this through your head ?
zak did not belong in that plane !
he shouldn' t have been there .
he he was only doing it foryou .
face it .
you killed him .
that' il be all , captain .
so now you' re telling me , um
now you' re telling me you' re a machine .
i' m a woman .
you' re a machine .
you' re a synthetic woman .
a robot .
i' ve said it three times now .
well , forgive me .
i' m having the tiniest little bit of trouble believing that .
the last time anybody saw the cylons , they looked like walking chrome toasters .
those models are still around .
they have their uses .
prove it .
if you' re a cylon , prove it to me right now .
i don' t have to .
you know i' m telling the truth .
see , stating something as the truth doesn' t necessarily make it so ...
' cause the truth of the matter is i don' t believe a word of this .
you believe me because deep down you' ve always known there was something different about me something that didn' t quite add up in the usual way .
and you believe me because it flatters your ego ... to believe that alone , among all the billions of people ... of the twelve colonies , you were chosen for my mission .
your mission ?
what mission ?
you knew i wanted access to the defence mainframe .
the wait a minute .
the defence mainframe ?
what exactly are you saying ?
come on , gaius .
the communications frequencies ?
deployment schedules ?
unlimited access to every database ?
oh , my god .
i had nothing to do with this .
you know i had nothing to do with this .
you have an amazing capacity for self deception .
how do you do that ?
how many people know about me , specifically ?
that i' m involved ?
and even now , as the fate of your entire world hangs in the balance ... all you can think about is how this affects you .
do you have any idea what they will do to me ifthey find out ?
they' d probably charge you with treason .
treason is punishable by the death penalty .
this is unbelievable .
what are you doing ?
phoning my attorney .
that won' t be necessary .
he' il know what to do .
he' il sort this out .
he' s the best in the business .
it won' t be necessary , because in a few hours ... no one will be left to charge you with anything .
what exactly are you saying ?
humanity' s children are returning home ... today .
i' d like to thank you all again for being here .
and , elosha , thankyou very much for those wonderful words .
next is a ceremonial fly by by the last galactica squadron ...
led by captain lee adama .
and now it is my great pleasure to introduce the last commander ... of the battlestar galactica , commander adama .
thankyou very much .
the cylon war is long over ... yet we must not forget the reasons why so many sacrificed so much ... in the cause offreedom .
the cost of wearing the uniform can be high ... but
sometimes it' s too high .
you know , when we fought the cylons ... we did it to save ourselves from extinction .
but we never answered the question , why ?
why are we as a people worth saving ?
we still commit murder because of greed , spite , jealousy .
and we still visit all of our sins upon our children .
we refuse to accept the responsibility for anything that we' ve done .
like we did with the cylons .
we decided to play god ... create life .
when that life turned against us ... we comforted ourselves in the knowledge ... that it really wasn ' t our fault , not really .
you cannot play god then wash your hands ofthe things that you' ve created .
sooner or later , the day comes ... when you can' t hide from the things that you' ve done any more .
you are one surprising son of a bitch .
colonial heavy 798 , this is viper 7242 .
my callsign is apollo , and i' il be your escort back to caprica .
copythat , viper 4272 .
glad to have you with us , apollo .
viper 7242 , raptor 31 2 .
this is boomer . just wanted to say it was an honour to fly with you , apollo .
ladies and gentlemen , we are now en route back to caprica .
lf you look out the , uh , starboard window ... you might be able to see one of galactica' s old mark two vipers ... which willbe escorting us back home .
we don' t have any further information yet .
there are no remaining ships able to leave caprica .
but no actual enemy has been sighted yet .
officials are saying there doesn' t seem any doubt [ explosion ]
what have i done ?
what am i gonna do ?
there' s no way out .
i know .
i' m sure you know .
that' s your doing , isn' t it ?
wait .
wait .
there has to be another way out of here .
i mean i mean , you must have an escape plan .
you' re not about to be destroyed by your own bombs , are you ?
how are you leaving ?
gaius , i can' t die .
when this body is destroyed , my memory , my consciousness ... will be transmitted to a new one .
i' il just wake up somewhere else in an identical body .
you mean there' s more out there like you ?
there are 1 2 models .
i' m number six .
i don' t want to die .
i don' t  get down .
c. i. c. to commanding officer .
go ahead .
i' m sorry to disturb you , sir ... but we have a priority one alert message from fleet headquarters .
it was transmitted in the clear .
in the clear ?
what does it say ?
attention all colonial units .
cylon attack underway .
this is no drill .
i' il be right there .
action stations , action stations .
set condition one throughout the ship .
this is not a drill .
repeat .
action stations , action stations .
set condition one throughout the ship .
this is not a drill .
repeat .
action stations , action stations .
set condition one throughout the ship .
this is not a drill .
not a drill ?
they can' t be serious .
sounds like it to me .
what are we gonna shoot with ?
the ship' s got no ammunition .
all right , people , let' s go .
let' s get this hangar bay ready for possible incoming .
what have we got ?
shipping accident ?
combat ?
understood .
condition one is set .
all decks report ready for action , sir .
very well .
this is a joke .
the fleet' s playing a joke on you .
it' s a retirement prank .
come on .
i don' t think so .
this is the commander .
moments ago this ship received word of a cylon attack against our home worlds ... is under way .
we do not know the size or the disposition or the strength ofthe enemy forces .
but all indications point ... to a massive assault against colonial defences .
admiral nagala has taken personal command of the fleet ... aboard the battlestar atlantia ... following complete destruction of picon fleet headquarters ... in the first wave ofthe attacks .
how , why ... doesn' t really matter now .
what does matter is that , as ofthis moment , we are at war .
you' ve trained for this .
you' re ready for this .
stand to your duties , trust your fellow ship mates ... and we' il all get through this .
further updates as we get them .
thankyou .
war with the cylons .
all right , people , this is what we do .
we' re the best , so let' s get the old girl ready to roll and kick some cylon ass !
come on !
let' s go !
move !
this better be for real .
tactical .
sir ?
begin a plot of all military units in the solar system , friendly or otherwise .
x. o. sir ?
we' re in a shooting war .
we need something to shoot .
i' il start checking munitions depots .
d. , send a signal to our fighter squadron .
i want positions and tactical status immediately .
yes , sir .
and get kara thrace out ofthe brig .
boomer , acknowledge galactica' s signals and send ' em our position .
tell them we' ve detected a formation of cylon fighters directly ahead , and i intend to attack .
boomer , doyou copy ?
copy that .
ease up there , boomer .
take a deep breath .
stand by .
helo ?
i show 1 0 .
no , no , make that five cylon raiders on course 324 mark 1 1 0 .
speed , 7 . 1 .
time to intercept , seven minutes .
you don' t sound too sure .
a lot of jamming going on .
cylons are using a lot of sensor decoys .
sorting through them , but
understood . just take your time , guide us in .
we' il do the rest .
yes , sir .
so that would put our squadron about here .
now , looks like the main fight is shaping up over here near virgon' s orbit .
but even at top speed , they' re still over an hour away .
plot a course along this axis .
if we can keep virgon between us and the battle ...
we might be able to get pretty close before the cylons are even aware .
at least , sir .
commander , ready for duty , sir .
good .
where the hell did the cylons come from ?
all we know for sure is they achieved complete surprise and we' re taking heavy losses .
we lost 30 battlestars in the opening attack .
that' s a quarter of the fleet .
i need pilots , and i need fighters .
pilots you got .
there' s 20 of us climbing the walls down in the ready room .
but fighters
i think i seem to remember an entire squadron of fighters ... down on the starboard hangar deck yesterday .
yes , sir .
you sure they' il fly ?
the reactor' s still hot , so all we have to do is pull the rad buffers from the engine ... refuel it , load the ordnance , and you' re ready to go .
the biggest problem is getting ' em over to the port launch bay .
why can' t we use the starboard launch ?
it' s a gift shop now .
frak me .
all right , let' s go !
everybody pick a bird !
we' re going to the port launch bay !
what' s the latest , d. ?
a lot of confusion .
i keep getting these weird reports about equipment malfunctions .
why is that weird ?
it' s the number of malfunctions .
one report said an entire battlestar lost power ... just before it came in contact with the enemy .
they said it was like someone just turned offa switch .
cylon formation ahead .
we' re down to two confirmed cylons now .
approaching visual range .
okay , boomer , we' il take it from here .
you back way off .
roger that .
allright , boys and girls , you break into attack formation .
there might only be two of them , but i want you to stick with your wingman and do not get overconfident .
anybody know what these things look like ?
pictures i' ve seen of the old cylon fighters were sort of like a big flying wing .
those pictures are 40 years old .
okay , keep the chatter down .
cag , boomer .
we' ve got a lot more contacts showin ' up .
looks like a couple of squadrons , at least .
all vipers , weapons free .
let' s go get ' em .
what the
i' ve lost power .
jolly .
jolly , take over .
jolly , can you read me ?
what are they doing ?
i don' t know .
they' re going straight in .
com chatter' s gone .
they' re not talking any more .
cag , boomer .
cag , boomer .
do you read ?
boomer , this is cag .
lfyou can hear me they must' ve done something to our computer system .
some sort of electronic jamming .
i' ve never seen anything like this .
there' s no cockpits .
nobody' s flying these things .
oh , my god .
no !
boomer , get us out of here !
right .
once again , we are processing the information that we have been given ... and i urge you all to try to stay calm .
as we get more information , i will pass it along to you .
we appreciate your patience .
thankyou .
what' s going on ?
i' m not sure .
any luck over there , captain ?
no .
just picking up a lot of confusing chatter .
well , to be honest with you , i' m kind of glad you' re stickin ' around .
makes us all feel better just seeing you out there .
well , don' t get too comfortable .
this old junker i' m in was meant for show , not combat .
if we run into a problem i' il do what i can to protect you .
but the first sign of trouble , you pour on the speed and you run .
don' t you worry about that .
i got my hand on the throttle .
it hasn' t left since i got that first message .
colonial heavy 798 out .
two missiles now .
jam the warheads !
i' m trying .
can' t find their frequency .
drop a swallow .
got two left .
damn it .
come on !
ah , frak !
what ?
check the screen ahead .
oh .
guess we found the main fight .
missile lock !
we got one left .
we' re hit !
oh , really ?
helo hey !
are you okay ?
present !
stay with me .
okay , we have a fuel leak .
we have to put down and repair it .
nearest world is caprica .
lot of company between us and there .
yeah .
so we' re cruisin ' ?
best way to avoid attracting attention .
no power signature , go in a straight line .
unless somebody actually gets close enough to see us ... we just look like a chunk of debris on the sensors .
i think we have enough inertia to make it to caprica ' s ionosphere ... then we power up and find a place to land .
nice .
nice thinkin ' there .
preliminary reports indicate ... a thermonuclear device in the 50 megaton range ... was detonated over caprica city 30 minutes ago .
nuclear detonations have been reported ... on the planets arilon , icon ...
sagittarian and geminon .
no reports of casualties , but they will be high .
how many people in caprica city alone ?
seven million .
mourn the dead later .
right now the best thing we can do is get this ship into the fight .
yes ?
excuse me .
um , one of the passengers has a short wave wireless .
they' ve heard a report that caprica has been nuked .
it has , hasn' t it ?
caprica and three other colonies .
i guess i , uh ...
i should go make an announcement or something .
i' il do it .
i' m a member of the political cabinet .
it' s my responsibility .
while i' m doing that , i would ask that you ... contact the ministry of civil defence and see what we can do to help .
including the colonies of caprica ...
picon ...
oh , my god .
arilon and tauron .
what about trevor ?
what about geminon ?
anything on geminon ?
my kids are on geminon !
okay , stop , stop !
please , stop !
please , i' m trying to reach the government right now to get more information .
in the meantime , we should all be prepared for an extended stay aboard this ship .
so , uh , you , please , and you , uh ... take an inventory of the emergency supplies and rations .
hey , wait a minute .
who put you in charge ?
well , that' s a good question .
the answer is no one .
but this is a government ship , and i am the senior government official , so that puts me in charge .
so why don' t you help me out and go down into the cargo area ... and see about setting it up as a living space .
everyone else , please , uh , please try and stay calm .
thankyou .
all right , this is the passenger manifest .
are you all right ?
yeah , yeah .
my parents moved to picon two months ago ... to be closer to my sisters and their families ... and their grandkids and
um
madam secretary , we' ve got your comlink .
yeah .
thank godyou' re not here , laura .
thank god .
jack .
i' ve never seen anything like it .
where is the president ?
dust in the air , thousands of people wandering the streets .
where is the president , jack ?
is he alive ?
i don' t know .
i think so .
we hear all kinds of things .
have the cylons made any demands ?
do we know what they want ?
no .
no contact .
i' m pretty sure about that .
has anyone discussed
has anyone discussed the possibility of surrender ?
has it been considered ?
after picon was nuked ... the president offered a complete unconditional surrender .
the cylons didn' t even respond .
colonial heavy 789 .
where ?
what should we do ?
uh , copy that .
the cylons have found us .
there' s an inbound missile .
where the hell did our escort go ?
krypter , krypter , krypter .
this is apollo to colonial heavy 798 .
i' m declaring an emergency .
flight systems are off line .
need assistance .
that' s six .
how you comin ' on that fuel line ?
almost there .
we' il be airborne pretty soon .
okay , that should do it .
sharon .
grab your sidearm .
helo  just stand your ground .
captain , are you all right ?
i' m fine .
uh , my name' s aaron doral .
i met you before .
took some publicity photos with you and your father .
what are these things ?
electric pulse generators from the galactica .
really ?
that' s interesting .
captain , i can' t tell you how glad i am to see you .
oh ?
why is that ?
personally , i' d feel a lot better ifsomeone qualified were in charge around here .
is something wrong with your pilot ?
no .
it' s just that he' s not the one giving orders .
this is , uh it' s a bad situation , isn' t it , sir ?
yes , it is .
right .
what if we transfer the " l " containers from bay three to bay four ?
then we would have one , two and three for passengers .
yeah , that' s doable .
that' s a lot of heavy lifting without dock loaders .
a little hard work is just what the people need right now .
captain , good to see you again .
likewise .
thanks for the lift .
you should thank her .
start the cargo transfer and prep bay three for survivors .
yes , ma' am .
i' m sorry .
survivors ?
as soon as the attack began , the government ordered a full stop on all civilian vessels ... so now we' ve got hundreds of stranded ships in the solar system .
some are lost , some are damaged , some are losing power .
we have enough space on this ship to accommodate up to 500 people ... and we' re going to need every bit of it .
but we don' t even know what the tactical situation is out there .
the tactical situation is that we are losing , right , captain ?
right .
so we pick up as many people as we can ... we try to find a safe haven to put down .
captain , i' d like you to look over the navigational charts ... for a likely place to hide from the cylons .
that' s all .
lady' s in charge .
that' s as close as you get , okay ?
let' s just settle down here .
settle down and no one gets hurt .
i' ve gotta get on board .
i' il give you 50, 000 cubits .
we' re not taking money !
sixty thousand !
this isn' t a rescue ship .
this is a military vessel , and we' re not taking money .

no one chooses .
