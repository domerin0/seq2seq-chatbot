an intermediary but necessary step ... before becoming man' s perfect complement : a woman .
do you iike it ?
can you give me a definition of grace ?
i' m not smart .
smile then .
that' ii be a good start .
smile when you don' t know something .
you won' t be any smarter , but it' s nice for others .
ailow yourself to be taken over by the faint fragility ... which wiii make your face beautiful .
a smile .
a smile ... is surface sweetness .
gentleness .
almost a mood .
