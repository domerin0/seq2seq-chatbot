mrs. wilson ?
mrs. wilson .
mrs. wilson , your husband , ben wilson senior , was one ofthe men killed last year in the explosion ... out at the reinhold cable plant .
yes , that' s right .
andyou were ieft with threesmaii children to raise onyourown .
yes , sir .
how do you provide foryou and your sons ?
i get a little bit of money from social security ... as a result of my husband' s death .
and , uh ,
i also give readings .
psychic readings .
yes , sir .
what doesbeingpsychic enableyou to do ?
i see things ... and i , you know i sense ... things ... that well , they hadn' t happened yet ... orthey were happening someplace else .
my granny told me that i i had a gift that runs in my family .
and she told me that i shouldn' t be afraid of it .
i should just always use my instinct and i' d i' d be all right .
so , you' reswearing before this court ... that you didn' t get your information about this tragedy ... from any other means than your special ability ?
your gift .
yes , sir .
i' m swearing that .
yes .
thankyou , mrs. wilson .
yes , sir .
i have no further questions .
mr. weems .
mrs. wilson .
how many fiingers am i holding up behind my back ?
objection , your honor .
yourhonor , my client is sitting in this courtroom on trial for his life ... partlybecause ofpowers that this woman claims to have .
now , in all fairness , i believe i should be given the opportunity ... to test the alleged powers ... instead of having to stand here and take her word for it .
you have a good point .
objection overruled .
can everyone in thejury box see how many fiingers i' m showing ?
how many fiingers , mrs. wilson ?
i don' t know .
you don' t know ?
seven .
seven fingers .
that that doesn' t prove anything .
your honor , i can' t do this , you know , at the drop ofa hat .
well , then , ma' am , how about doing it at the drop ofa dollar bill ?
what are you trying to say ?
i' m trying to say maybe this special gift ofyours doesn' t work ... unless you' re being paid for it .
like they say in the army , " no money , no honey .
no , that' s not true .
are you aware that in hatcher county it' s against the law ... for a psychic to set up shop and charge people money ?
well , i don' t charge money .
you just testifiied that you do charge money .
no .
i accept donations .
people give me gifts .
oh .
a distinction worthy ofa lawyer .
mrs. wilson , you a rich woman ?
no .
why not ?
if i had psychic powers and could read the future , i' d be fiilthy rich .
i' dbeplaying thestockmarket .
i' dbe overin mobile betting on the dogs .
i' d certainly warn my husband not to go to work ... on the day i know the reinhold plant' s gonna blow up ...
leaving three little ol ' children to be raised in a carnival sideshow .
well , it doesn' t work that way , sir .
i can' t use my gift for personal gain .
except for those , uh , what you call ' em , donations ?
you' ve had some personal trouble with donnie barksdale , haven' t you ?
yes , i have .
just a few weeks ago , you told him i believe the exact words was ... you was gonna have his ass thrown in jail .
but he was threatening my kids .
ain' t it also true ... that a few weeks ago in one of those famous readings ofyours , when you were doing your so called e. s. p. , you told valerie barksdale , donnie' s wife , that donnie wasjust an insecure redneck ... and that he wasn' t really crazy enough to kill anybody ?
yes , i did say that .
then why today are you saying he did kill somebody ?
wait a second .
i' ve never said that .
you might as well have , ma' am .
you wanted his ass in jail .
he' s on trial for his life .
i just told the sheriffwhat i saw .
and how could any of us ever forget that ?
jessica kingjust floatin ' up in that tree , naked , with a chain ... wrappedaroundher .
it must be so much fun foryou .
you must be having the time ofyour life ... entertaining yourself with your dreams and your visions .
you think it' s fun seeing decomposed bodies in my tree , do you , sir ?
you think that' s fun ?
do you think it' s fun i have people trying to strangle me in my sleep ?
nowl' m sittinghere andl' m blaming myself ...
' cause some poor crazy man tried to burn his daddy halfto death .
and you think i' m sitting here having fun ?
i' m sorry , sir .
you' re crazy ifyou think that .
no more questions , your honor .
you' re dismissed .
like theysay in hoilywood , iet' sjust cut to the chase .
did you or did you not kill jessica king ?
i did not .
did you or did you not seejessica king on the night she was killed ?
yeah , i seen her .
would you describe the circumstances , please ?
well , i' d been seeing her for quite a while .
wouldyou clarify what you mean by " seeing " ?
i mean , her and me had been having sex .
okay , go ahead .
weil , she cailedme about 1 1 . : 00 .
so i told her i' d meet her out at ayjay' s .
and i told my wife i was going out for a beer .
what happened after that ?
well , we got in an argument .
she told me she didn' t want to see me no more .
did she tell you why ?
she said she was getting married ... in a couple of months and she wanted to stop playing around .
at ieast tiilafterthe wedding .
andduring the course ofthisargument with miss king , did you at any moment strike her ?
yes , sir .
what happened afteryou struck her ?
weil , she bangedherhead prettyhard when she went down , so i idecided to take herto the hospital .
did you reach the hospital ?
no , sir .
are you feeling okay ?
i' m fiine .
i wanna go back .
i don' t wanna go to the hospital .
someone
someone might see me .
shesaidshe wasfeelingbetter , so itookherback toayjay' s .
idroppedheroff , then i went on backhome .
andthat was the verylast time thatyousawjessica kingalive ?
yes , sir .
the very last .
donnie , are you guilty ofthe charge against you ?
i' m guilty ofcheating on my wife , ofbeinga badhusband , a badchristian .
but i ain' t guilty of killingjesse .
i swear to god .
no more questions , your honor .
mr. duncan .
mr. barksdale , you' re a wife beater , aren' t you ?
i' ve swore to tell the truth here today .
yeah , i' ve hit valerie before .
i guess it ain' t no secret .
so , you admit to havinga history ofviolence against women ?
you also admit to having beaten up the victim ... on the night that she was murdered .
i wouldn' t exactly say that i beat her up .
you' re the expert .
you teilme .
just howbadly doyou ... have to beat a woman before it fiits your defiinition of " beating up " ?
now , yourstoryis thatyou' ve been havingan affair ... with the victim .
but tell us why a beautiful young woman likejessica king ... from one ofthe fiinest families in brixton , just about to be married to a good , decent professional man ... and with a bright , shining future in front ofher
why would a woman like that get involved with something like you ?
i asked her that myselfone time .
she said i was the only man in town who knew how to fuck .
you' re really disgusting .
you know that ?
objection , your honor .
objection sustained .
mr. duncan , you will refrain from making those personal comments .
i apologize , your honor .
it won' t happen again .
so , let' s get this straight .
let' s clarify this .
you' re saying it was just a coincidence ... that on the very same night that you physically assaulted jessica king , someone else put her body in your pond ?
i' m not saying it was a coincidence .
what are you saying ?
i' m saying i got framed !
oh , well , what an original defense .
did you think ofjessica king as a stray cat ?
no .
did you tell sheriffjohnson that a stray cat had clawed your arm ?
yeah .
didn' t you just tell the court ...
jessica had scratched your arm ?
yeah , but
didn' t you tell sheriffjohnson you got scratched by the stray cat ... because she didn' t like it when you killed her ?
yeah , but i was lying .
my wife was standing right there !
how do i know you' re not lying now ?
because i' m not , goddamn it !
it' s her , goddamn it !
be seated , mr. barksdale !
she' s the reason i' m up here !
she' sagoddamn witch !
she' sputting speils on every goddamn body in town !
witch !
witch !
yeah , you run !
i' ilhave orderin the courtroom .

we can get on with our lives now .
i guess i' m the last person you wanna see .
how you been ?
terrible .
annie , ifyou tell me to get going , i will .
i wouldn' t blame you .
but i need you to read for me .
give me a hand .
i feel like i can' t hold on any longer .
i know donnie' s mean and everything , but i feel real lost without him .
you know , i ain' t never been on my own before .
and i' m i' m scared , annie .
you don' t need to be scared , hon .
you' il be fiine .
you see that in the cards ?
mm hmm .
right through here .
but can you see what what i' m thinking ?
can you see that in the cards ?
what do you mean ?
well ,
i' ve been thinking some real bad , bad thoughts .
unchristian thoughts .
like what ?
like
i' m glad that girl' s dead .
jessica .
she was messin ' around with my husband and deserved what she got .
no one deserves that .
like i said , i know it' s unchristian .
what ?
what , areyou seeingsomethingbad ?
i don' t know .
it' s not clear .
fuckyou !
wayne ?
wayne ?
it' s not normally like this .
you need to lie down .
i' m really not sleepy .
i think ifyou sleep , you' il feel better .
thankyou , annie .
oh .
it' s okay .
wayne .
i don' t think this is a good idea .
no .
it' s not .
i just thought we could forget all this for a while .
you want to , don' tyou ?
i know there' s something between us .
i can' t .
i guess i still feel married .
you' re not , though .
he' s gone .
i know .
you gotta learn to deal with that .
the same way i gotta learn to deal with the fact thatjessica' s gone .
she' s dead .
oh , wayne , i' m so sorry .
it' s okay .
no , it' s not okay .
i i don' t think donnie barksdale killed her .
no , no , annie .
i' m really sorry .
i can' t i can' t do this .
it' s fiinished .
i know .
i wanna let that bastard rot in jail .
but he' s guilty .
no , wayne .
i see it .
i see he didn' t do it .
do you see who did ?
uh , i' m trying , but i i
i don' t know yet .
what are we gonna do ?
well , if i had a piece ofclothing ... or maybe i could go out to the pond or see if i
it' s not over .
jesus .
come on in .
well , what brings you out here ?
well , i' il just come straight out and say it .
i don' t think donnie barksdale killed jessica king .
well , sure he did .
it was an open and shut case .
i' m telling you he didn' t .
the person that killed jessica is still out there someplace .
what' s the deal ?
the barksdales been threatening you ?
no .
i' il talk to pearl johnson .
this has nothing to do with the barksdales .
listen .
i know that donnie didn' t kill jessica ... the same way that i knew that her body was in his pond .
and do you know who did kill her ?
no .
so , what do you care ?
the son ofa bitch is in jail .
i got a warning today .
i think somebody is gonna try and kill me .
what do you want me to do ?
reopen the case and fiind out who really did it .
i can' t .
he' s been convicted .
well , you can talk to somebody .
i' ve got no basis to open this case .
i' d look like a fool .
i don' t give a damn how you look .
now , you listen to me .
i know you had an affair withjessica .
so how do you thinkyou' re gonna look if people fiind out ... you had sex with the victim the night before she was killed ?
do you want money ?
no .
i want you to reopen the case .
there' s a saying about letting sleeping dogs lie .
you thinkyou' re in danger now ?
look at it logically .
the real danger begins ifthis case gets reopened and someone starts ... worrying that you' re gonna have another one ofyour damn dreams .
all i know is , the wrong man' s in jail .
i don' t care how awful he is .
and i helped put him there .
i can' t live with something like that .
so you fiind a way to reopen this case , sir .
or i will .
