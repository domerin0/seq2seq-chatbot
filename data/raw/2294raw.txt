during the first world war , time square was the premier theater district in the nation .
and today , as you can see , it' s just as exciting .
hey , it' s mtv where they filmed trl .
great .
take a picture .
you need to be in it , too .
you' re killing me with the pictures .
you know that , right ?
we' re on vacation .
ask that guy to take it for us .
hurry before we drive by .
you want it so bad , you ask him .
excuse me , sir ?
hello ?
excuse me ?
sir ?
hello ?
how long is this tour ?
that was funny .
so , what do we got here ?
new twist on the " bitch ride to hell .
gang members dig up a rival' s corpse and send it around the city on the subway ?
i mean , this isn' t chicago , mac .
it' s urban legend .
looks like a practical joke .
times square .
tour bus .
tourist t shirt .
somebody was trying to scare the tourists and used a prop shop skeleton , huh ?
store bought skeletons are bleached and processed .
they also have drill marks from when they were assembled .
this skull is brown and no drill marks .
and it' s missing a mandible .
if this is a joke , i' m not laughing .
these bones are real .

this is it ?
yeah .
mannequin clothes , ball cap ... bones ...
clever .
not that clever .
whoever assembled your skeleton never took an anatomy class .
humerus was where the ulna should be .
metacarpals were reversed with phalanges .
held together by wire .
he used this for the fingers .
adhesive putty .
looks like our " sculptor " left a little piece of himself behind .
there he is .
he " ?
yeah .
pronounced brow ridge .
large mastoid process behind where the ears would be .
and this seals it .
inion hook .
no doubt about it , this skull was male .
off to a good start .
what else ?
well , head is long and narrow .
same with the nasal aperture .
nasal bone and spine are long stick out over the maxilla .
caucasoid traits .
he' s white .
how old ?
medial clavicle is the last bone to fuse .
happens between 18 and 25 .
a flake develops on the clavicle where it connects to the sternum .
it eventually envelops the entire end cap of the clavicle , smoothing it out .
but look at his .
round and lumpy .
flake hasn' t yet started to form .
he wasn' t even 18 .
he was just a kid .
homicide ?
maybe .
this fracture never healed .
so , it could have been a death blow ?
well , without the rest of the bones , all i can do is speculate .
well , tendons , tissues and ligaments are all gone .
what , probably three years since he died ?
mm hmm .
bones are in good shape .
he was probably shielded from mother nature .
only thing out of the ordinary is their color .
the natural decomposition color of bones is brown .
so , where did this black discoloration come from ?
well , that' s for you folks on the outside .
i need to borrow a finger .
skeleton on a tour bus in times square .
the post is going to love this story .
practically writes itself .
it' s not news .
true , but it' s gonna sell a hell of a lot of papers .
only because of where it was found .
the real story is that these are the bones of a teenage boy .
the media don' t care .
i do .
mac , when can i get my hands on that skull ?
one step at a time , aiden .
we have to find the rest of his skeleton first .
i' m just saying , intact skulls are few and far between .
if the time comes , i don' t want it farmed out .
i can handle it .
relax .
you got it .
i' il find you when i need you .
human skull .
big fun .
danny , what do you see ?
the substance isn' t just coating the bone .
it' s layered on itself .
means it' s been there a while .
take a deeper sample .
top layer is composed of aromatic hydrocarbons .
engine exhaust .
mtbe ?
no .
means the engine was diesel .
rules out most cars .
probably came from a truck or a bus .
so , your boy' s laying low in a high traffic area .
unfortunately , in new york , that' s everywhere .
deeper sample is also diesel exhaust .
but check the benzene concentration .
through the roof .
what kind of diesel engine spits out this much particulate matter ?
an old one .
epa changed diesel emissions standards in 1994 .
so , if he has this much benzene on his bones ...
he' s been collecting dust a lot longer than three years .
he' s been dead a decade , at least .
our timeline just jumped .
i heard .
brings back bad memories in this city .
' 90 to ' 93 , the average murder rate was 2, 000 per year .
dream with me a city that can be better than the way it is now .
inauguration speech from giuliani' s first term , 1994 .
i was working narcotics back then out of brooklyn north .
we' d collared up every day ; barely made a dent .
in the parks , you found more crack vials and hypos than kids .
it was a dangerous time .
here we go .
we have six possible matches to the body fingerprint .
who do you want to start with ?
with him .
lester jayne .
stella .
admiring your work ?
hey .
can' t believe you' re jamming me up for this .
i burned a few tourists .
that' s all .
it was a joke .
nypd didn' t find it funny .
that' s their problem .
no , it' s yours .
autopsy revealed the skeleton' s a homicide victim .
murder ?
no .
i ain' t buying that .
your little joke had a fractured skull .
which had nothing to do with me .
no ?
then who does it have to do with ?
i know what you guys do .
you twist things all around till i don' t know which end is up .
i told you , all i did was screw with some tourists , and i' m not saying another word .
where' s he going ?
decomposition on the clothes and under the bones .
i think this is where he died .
i think it' s also where he lived .
what do you think ?
runaway ?
maybe .
a. m.
initials ?
yeah
home must' ve been pretty bad to trade for this place .
i' m sure this wasn' t what he had in mind .
skull fracture .
blunt force trauma ?
pocketknife .
must have been pretty important to him to keep it in his shoe .
bright lights , big city .
pages are dog eared .
highlighted .
copyright 1984 .
he may have been lying here for 20 years .
have you ever read it ?
no .
you ?
yeah .
it' s about a guy who lives up new york for all it' s worth .
how' s it end ?
he gets out before the city kills him .
it' s tough being in the bullpen , huh ?
waiting for the nod .
thanks for your concern .
here we go .
very nice .
got a full skeleton now .
no more speculation .
facts from here on out .
femur gives stature .
he was five foot ten .
mandible completes the skull .
check out his teeth .
nice .
too nice .
braces ?
had to be .
two canine teeth , two second bicuspids , but no first bicuspids .
caucasians commonly suffer from dental crowding .
teeth were pulled to make room for the others to straighten out .
okay .
so , at some point in his life he saw a dentist and an orthodontist .
which means he probably had parents who paid the bill .
it was probably the last time he got to see a doctor .
at least , that' s what his tibia' s saying .
broke his leg .
and let it heal on its own .
probably left him with a solid limp .
this kid was moving in the wrong direction .
checked him head to toe .
with what i' ve got , he only potential fatal injury is a skull fracture .
danny' s running prints on a pipe we found at the scene .
could that have done the trick ?
easily .
he id' d ?
sent out dentals results aren' t back yet .
i' il cut a section of mid shaft femur , send it to dna .
but if he' s a street kid , i wouldn' t expect much .
i got a back up plan .
been waiting all day for this .
talk to me .
white , john doe teenager .
nice teeth .
bum leg .
no face .
no problem .
here he is .
john doe teenager .
fingerprints danny lifted went nowhere .
whoever left them ... isn' t listed in afls .
do you have a name ?
no .
got usable dna off the bones , but there are no matches in the codls missing persons database .
we can' t id him on dna .
mac ... you still with me ?
yeah .
yeah .
sorry .
i was just thinking about something you said earlier ... about a guy following his dreams ... getting out before the city kills him .
he never got out .
why ?
hey ...
danny just called .
says there' s some people who want to see you ... about him .
we , uh , we waited for this day so long ...
finding aaron ...
our son .
mr. moreland , we haven' t been able to positively identify the remains that were found .
we read in the papers , and the detective at dcpi confirmed , that a backpack and a pocketknife were found .
uh ... uh ... they belonged to aaron .
the backpack was monogrammed .
i stitched it myself .
and the pocketknife was a gift for his 13th birthday .
i ordered it special .
we found other items , also .
clothes ... a book .
it' s aaron .
was aaron an artist ?
yes .
a musician .
uh ...
aaron , uh ... he left home in 1987 .
uh ... he was 17 , just out of high school .
he wanted to see something other than minnesota before thinking about college .
this is a reconstruction of what the skeleton would look like .
it' s , um ... it' s not aaron .
that' s ... not our son .
i i don' t know who that is .
i' m sorry .
nice .
just the person i was looking for .
i put some of my time into that fingerprint i pulled from the pipe .
extra effort .
i like that .
talk to me .
i got 117 arrest records for people charged with crimes that were committed within three blocks of where our skeleton was found .
time frame 1984 to ' 94 .
you used the cars system .
yeah , where suspects are acquitted or the charges are dropped .
which means the fingerprints won' t be found in afls .
they' re somewhere in a sealed file of the nypd .
mm hmm .
i just got to find them .
and hope that they match the prints you pulled off the pipe .
that' s a long shot , danny .
what' re you saying ?
you want me to drop this lead ?
no , i want you to stick to the hot evidence first .
the clothes the victim was found in , i' m already on it .
good , all right ?
you learn something , find me .
you come up dry , get back on those arrest records .
got it ?
got it .
hi .
playing hangman ?
actually , yes .
but i' ve run out of letters .
i have ...
i have no idea what this is .
for now .
what do you make of this ?
look familiar ?
not really .
it' s the last sketch in his book , and ...
looks like it could be an island ... .. but not in new york .
no people , no buildings .
got a call from missing persons .
they pulled all the unsolved case folders from teenage boys missing within our time frame .
thumbed through them by hand , based on aiden' s reconstruction .
no matches .
unlike aaron moreland , there' s no one out there looking for this kid .
so all we know about who he was , are his images of new york .
skyline .
busy grand central station .
empire state building .
see his perspective ?
street level .
part of the city , moving with the flow .
yeah , but look at this one .
he' s totally alone in times square .
he was swallowed up by the city .
lost .
reality rarely lives up to expectations , especially if you' re a teenager .
this one with the crisscross beams .
that' s the port authority .
upper parking deck .
yeah , but he' s looking at it straight on .
which means ...
he' s inside the only building in the city that allows homeless kids free reign to every floor .
i started danner house in a tenement on the lower east side in 1969 .
intended it to be a youth crisis center .
nobody under the age of 21 would be turned away .
first month , 500 kids came through the door .
5, 000 by the end of the first year .
there' s never a shortage of people that need help .
guess we' re not an uncommon sight around here .
joel , how we doing today ?
uh ...
we' re running low .
i don' t think we' re going to make it .
call over to st. juliana' s .
see if they have any meals left over from yesterday .
they usually run out of meals before we do .
would you by chance recognize this young man ?
we don' t have a name for him , but we think he might have stayed here sometime between 1984 and 1994 .
it' s been a long time .
i' ve been here 35 years .
i used to try to get to know the kids , but ...
after a while , all the faces start to look the same .
i' m going to check with danny , see how he' s doing on the clothes .
you going to follow up with the piece of paper we found in the jeans ?
mr. and mrs. moreland ?
do you know who the boy was that had aaron' s things ?
no .
no , unfortunately we don' t know anything new that you that you haven' t already read in the papers .
but he he had aaron' s backpack an and pocketknife .
how did he get them ?
we don' t know .
but they' re the only connection to my son .
they had to know each other , right ?
i need to know what happened .
i know the reality ....
he' s probably dead ...
i' ve accepted that , but ... but this is the closest that we' ve , we' ve come to the truth in 17 years .
please .
what happened to my boy ?
he' s somebody else' s case , isn' t he ?
you don' t know what ... what happened to aaron ... because you' re not looking for him ...
are you ?
no .
mac ?
i took some new photos of the reconstruction .
i thought i' d send them out nationally ,
and maybe someone will recognize him .
work one police plaza .
use the in house reporters from the major papers .
get his face all over the city .
you' ve already done that , haven' t you ?
i figured it was one of the few times that us and the media are on the same team , so ...
well , stay on them .
keep him front page .
hey , do you need anything else ?
yeah .
i need to know what this is .
anyway , most of the shirt was gone , but i can make out a small portion of the logo .
an " l. " lagaronne .
fancy , and expensive .
and synthetic .
nylon microfiber .
all the rage in the early ' 90s .
the victim had a couple of things on him that didn' t belong to him .
same probably goes for the shirt .
you know , five finger discount .
yeah , but not from a store .
what do you know ?
i reached out to the manufacturer .
turns out that shirt never went on the market .
prototype from 1988 .
all right , well , if there was no store to steal it from , how' d he get it ?
seventh avenue , right off the rack .
rack runner .
no experience necessary .
if you can walk from point " a " to point " b , " you' re hired .
it' s a perfect job for a teenager , and easy access to clothes you can' t afford .
so management' s official statement is that they unofficially hire street kids to run the racks .
in other words , cheap labor , no paperwork .
did anyone recognize the vic ?
life span with the racks isn' t too long .
here today , gone tomorrow .
there' s nobody working here now that was working here in ' 88 .
of course not .
time marches on , the practice stays the same .
dead end on the shirt .
but it wasn' t a total loss .
since it wasn' t made till 1988 , we know he was alive then .
so we' ve narrowed our time line .
yeah , six year window instead of ten .
make that four .
he was alive february 21 , 1990 .
pawned a watch .
yeah .
and we have the ticket .
i' m sorry , pal , but you' re a few hours late .
owner just came in and picked it up .
the owner' s been dead since dinkins was mayor .
he didn' t just come by .
look , what do you want me to tell you ?
i had that watch forever .
today a guy comes in , describes it perfectly .
even the inscription on the back .
ticket or no ticket , the thing had to be his .
no coincidence the watch is picked up today after 14 years .
somebody else knew it was here and didn' t want us to get it first .
someone who knows we' re looking for him .
but it' s not 1990 anymore .
it' s gotten a lot harder to hide .
guy played the camera perfectly .
kept his head down the entire time .
so this is our best view of the only suspect we have ?
unfortunately .
get creative .
done .
okay ... >from the top .
mystery man enters .
keeps his head down , goes straight to the counter .
didn' t even stop to look at the jewelry .
he doesn' t have to , he knows what he wants .
freeze it .
bruno' s glasses .
can you pull a reflection ?
mm hmm .
no problem .
cleaning up , we have ...
a great shot of his baseball cap .
keep going .
he' s steps away from freedom .
what' s he doing ?
it' s not on screen , but that doesn' t mean it' s not on tape .
ntsc signals are overscanned .
all right , how much are we missing ?
it' s a guitar ...
it' s dna ...
creative enough for you ?
partial dna profile from the guitar strings has got a hit in the codls missing persons database .
the missing kid who owned the backpack and pocketknife ?
aaron moreland ...
you' re kidding ?
he disappeared in ' 87 .
he was 17 years old .
which means he' s now 34 .
and the prime suspect in a murder .
where are we ?
we' re there .
in 1987 , aaron moreland was a 17 year old kid .
here' s a pretty good idea of what he looks like today .
you guys know him ?
it was your dna on the guitar string .
i was going to be a musician , you know .
that' s why i came to new york .
to be a rock star .
but i was 17 .
had spent every day of my life in a town with one intersection .
i wasn' t prepared for this city .
by the end of my first week here , i was broke ... and hooked .
did you know him ?
sort of .
i used to ran racks down on seventh avenue and i' d see him there every now and then .
he always had money and i always needed it .
how did you get the pocketknife ?
when i was high , i' d get angry very easily .
and so i didn' t want to do anything that i would regret later .
so you also sold the knife ?
yeah .
he was easy to find .
port authority ... all those busses .
all you had to do was get on one .
i didn' t want to go home .
here you go , man .
it' s a pawn ticket .
for my watch .
man , that' s all you got ? !
i need more .
you killed him over two dollars ?
six years later , i got clean .
changed my life .
my name .
began helping others .
and forgot about your past .
until i picked up the paper and it all came back .
so you tried to cover it up .
you' re not in the system .
your own parents thought you were dead .
everything was good .
but you knew there was still one thing out there that connected you to the victim .
your watch .
you may have started over , but your mother and father never stopped looking for you .
get up .
aaron ...
what was his name ?
i don' t know .
you already know how it ends .
that' s not why i' m reading it .
but what you are left with is a premonition of the way your life will fade behind you , like a book you have read too quickly ...
leaving a dwindling trail of images and emotions , until all you can remember is a name .
his name .
it' s the only thing we don' t know .
now we never will .
so that' s it , huh ?
case closed .
yep .
listen , a bunch of us are going to sullivan' s for a drink .
want to come with ?
nah , i got case files to the moon .
case files can wait , mac .
come on , you need to get out .
if this case taught us anything , it was to live life , right ?
thanks anyway .
next time .
all right .
suit yourself .
hey , stella ...
yeah ?
how' s the coffee there ?
they have irish coffee .
you' re gonna love it .
