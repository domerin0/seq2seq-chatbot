no , i was just going to use the mirror and ...
good god ...
that' s the way it is .
we can' t go out ' cause i wasn' t wearing any pants ?
you' re still too immature to understand you can' t go around like that ?
imagine if it' d been someone else ?
yes , imagine .
i' d be embarrassed myself .
get a mirror so we don' t go out there .
we had a lovely mirror , but someone broke it .
you' re nagging ...
mum , it was just the lift .
she wasn' t going to go out .
let this be a lesson .
it doesn' t hurt being at home .
i don' t like you going out to raves ...
mum , it isn' t a rave , it' s just a normal party .
it' s elin who goes on about raves .
it' s decided .
but , we' ve never even been to a rave .
you know that raves are out ?
i read it in a magazine .
they were in an " out " list .
where does it say they' re out ?
here , somewhere .
why must we live in fucking shit and piss ml ? !
when something' s in it takes so long to get here
it' s out already because we' re so fucking behind !
we can' t stay here , we have to move !

she' s not worth having .
i think she' s worth having .

i said you thought nothing of him .
not as far as i know , anyway .
god this sucks !

i' m not going .
you wanted to fall in love .

i think johan is sweet .
he' s at high school and has a moped !
yes , but maybe he' d be good for you .
hardly .
can' t we go somewhere else ?

i don' t know .
i' d even rather go to agnes .

what do you want to hear ?
i don' t know ...

but ...
maybe i should go home .
shit , let' s go to the party .
i have to anyway ' cause my jacket' s there .
we' il go and hit someone .
no , i' m not invited .
so ?
we' il burn the house down .

please ...
you want to ?
yeah .
what you gonna be when you grow up ?
i don' t know .
i' m going to be a model .
or i' m gonna be a psychologist .
i' ve also thought of that .
really ?
you' re also gonna be that ?
dunno , it seems exciting digging in peoples minds and ...
but really , you' il probably find it silly , i' d most like to be a writer .
you can be that too .
you could books about those ... .. those , like , all that psychic stuff and mass murderers .
but i' d rather be a model .
you think i can be ?
yes .
but i think it' s more fun being a psychologist .
am i pretty enough ?
yes , you are .
i don' t think i want to go to that party .
why are you so weird ?
i don' t mean anything but ...
you are weird .
you' re also weird .
am i ?
yes .
i want to be weird .
well , not weird but ...
i don' t want to be like everyone else .
though , sometimes i' m just the same ,
but you' re not .
you know what my nightmare is ?
that i' il stay in ml .
that i' il never move from here .
i' il get kids , a car , a house ...
all of that .
then my husband leaves with someone younger
and i' m stuck with kids that just scream and nag .
it' s so fucking meaningless .
where' re you from ?
i mean , where' d you live before here ?
mariefred .
was it fun there ?
okay ...
more fun than ml , anyway ?
maybe .
can i ask you something ?
what ?
have you been with lots of girls ?
why' re you asking that ?
i was just wondering .
no , i haven' t been with lots of girls if you must know .
when you kissed me ...
i could die , sorry !
it was the first time .
was it ?
first and last time .
but that' s completely wrong !
it' s just ' cause you live in fucking ml .
it' s so unfair .
if you lived in stockholm , for example , then ...
then you' d have loads of girls .
you think so ?
yes ...
where' re you going ?
come .
we' re going to stockholm .
you' re not sane !
' course i am , ' course i' m sane .
okay , but you' re on the wrong side .
what ?
stockholm' s that way .
i see ...
come on !
are you serious ?
we say 10 cars from now .
if any stop , we' re going to stockholm .
otherwise , forget it .
five .
10 .
five .
okay , five .
if any of them stop , it' s like god' s telling us .
idiot !
watch out !
when i get a car , i' il always stop for hitchhikers .
shit !
we' il do it .
let' s do it !
should we ?
come on !
hi .
we' re going to stockholm .
we live there .
we' ve been visiting our aunt and got money for the train
and bought records with the money and can' t get home .
you can come with me to karlstad .
thanks very much !
no !
it does this sometimes .
i' il just ...
what the hell are we doing ?
we' re fucking crazy !
i know .
but we' re so fucking cool .
what on earth are you up to ?
is this " candid camera " ?
out of the car !
it' s freezing .
i should go home .
mum' s coming home soon and ...
but i can call you tomorrow .
do you want to ?
you sure ?
yeah ...
oops , i thought it was mum .
what' re you doing ?

that would seem odd , she' il wonder .
elin ...
where' ve you been ?
nowhere special .
some guy ?
no ... yeah .
who ?
no one .
tell me !
stop it .
but , tell me !
leonardo dicaprio is skinny .

didn' t sound like a nightmare .
but it was .
someone was going to kill me .
didn' t sound like that .
but they were .
i was dreaming , wasn' t i ?
so i should know .
i know you' re not a victim of palsy .
i don' t know why i said that .
and that perfume actually smells really good .
and the wheelchair match .
basketball .
isn' t the most boring i' ve done .
why' d you say it then ?
i don' t know .
you don' t know ?
you know what ?
it doesn' t make any difference anymore .
' cause i' ve never liked you .
and i never will , either .
it' il be so nice to be rid of you .
i won' t need to worry you' il paw someone and be nauseating .
the whole school will found out what you are .
and hey ...
good luck with elin .
ahlberg .
am i disturbing you ?
no .
were you calling him ?
who ?
him from yesterday you won' t say .
no .
there was no one at home .

no .
i said i' d call , but i won' t .
of course you will .
you' re in love .
i can see it .
i' m not at all !
why can' t you just tell me who it is ?
you don' t understand .
you' d hate me , you' d never speak to me again .

homosexual .
i' m just kidding .
we have 1, 000 crowns on the line .
look at the first page .
aren' t you going out ?
no .
are you fighting again ?
why do you always fight ?
' cause we don' t like each other .
' cause we' re different .
she' s the biggest drip and i' m the coolest in the world .
you sure we have the same dad ?
of course you have !
let' s not talk about him .
haven' t you got a lottery ticket ?
what ?
no ...
why are we watching it then ?
i thought we' d win a car .
why are we looking at it ?
well , it' s ...
lot' s of reasons .
the music and ... other things too .
it' s fun to watch when someone wins .
see how much they win .
totally meaningless ...
hello .
hi .
what are you doing ?
can' t you come here ?
i don' t know .
sorry i said what i did .
sorry i called you that and stuff .
i didn' t mean to .
i really thought it was markus .

i don' t know .
please ...
yeah ...
johan' s here .
please ...
okay , i' il come .

can i talk to you ?
elin' s sitting over there ...
i think she wants to talk to you .
with me ?
yes .
just stroll over and talk to her .
should i talk to her ?
yes , talk to her .
hi .
hi .
jessica said you wanted to talk to me .
have you got anything to drink ?
yes .
have you ?
here .
markus ... no ...
markus , control yourself ...
markus , we were just talking .
oh , yeah ?
stop it ...
markus ...
elin .
it' s agnes ...
hi .
hi .
hi .
hello .
sweetheart , how are you ?
has something in particular happened ?
shall we talk about it ?
i recognize so much of myself in you .
when i was at your age ... .. i had no friends , no girls were interested in me .
but then ... then all of that changes .
and it becomes the other way around .
like when i was at the 25 year class reunion last spring .
i noticed that it was me ...
well , things had gone quite well for me .
i' d done quite well .
but that guy bengt
who was the king of the class then , he' d became nothing .
and those girls who were regarded as the prettiest in the class ... .. they weren' t noteworthy at all anymore .
you should be glad you' re not someone who has it easy
who has no problems , because those people are often uninteresting .
but dad you' re talking , like , in 25 years .
sorry , but i' d rather be happy now than in 25 years .
sure , you' re right .
perhaps it' s not much of a comfort at the moment .
but , anyway ...
' cause in 25 years ...
that' s , like , 25 years ... it doesn' t exist .
are you two in the same programme ?
i' m in electrics and he' s in vehicles .
did you have to do that ?
he was groping you .
he was doing nothing like that .
he wasn' t doing that ?
what programme are you going to do ?
i haven' t decided .
what' s jessica going to do ?
child and leisure .
she' s also applied for hairdressing , but i don' t think she' il get in .
don' t be where i am then !
can' t you see it' s embarrassing ?
you' re a mental case .
thanks , maybe i am .
i' m with you .
you become what you' re with .
i' m going to be a psychologist ...
i think so , anyway .
psychologist ?
but which programme do i follow ? .
are you going to be a psychologist ?
yes .
