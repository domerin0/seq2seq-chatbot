lost portman on comm ... and all i' ve got on destroyer is a wall .
portman , come in .
destroyer .
come in .
this is corporal dean portman ... with rrts 6 special ops on olduvai , 0310 hours .
we have encountered hostile activity .
i repeat , require immediate rrts reinforcements .
destroyer , portman , where the hell are you ?
shit .
shit .
0h , god !
jesus !
hmm .
pinky , you got portman ?
no .
holy shit .
he' s gone .
destroyer ?
and portman .
what the fuck happened , man ?
i got him , i got him .
destroyer , i got you , man .
what' s up , man ?
what the hell is this ?
and whose goddamn blood is on that window ?
goat' s .
he killed himself .
what do you mean , he killed himself ?
he was already dead .
it' s true .
it' s goat .
he was changing into one of these motherfuckers and he killed himself .
we found two more scientists at the dig .
thurman and a balding guy with glasses .
dr. clay .
did you check their necks ?
were there open wounds on their necks ?
we were conducting a firefight , not an autopsy .
we came up here to find six scientists .
four are known dead ... and dr. willits is probably kla somewhere down in that sewer .
the only one missing is dr. carmack .
has dr. carmack showed up yet ?
oh , he' s shown up all right .
look at the left ear .
son of a bitch .
i think this other one is steve willits .
i' m going to run the dna , check it against his med records .
what are you people working on up here ?
we' re analyzing bones , artifacts .
we' re not doing anything like this .
then what the fuck is that ?
it must be a genetic mutation , something environmental or viral .
i don' t know .
it may even be reversible .
it' s irreversible .
not necessarily .
dr. carmack' s condition ... is irreversible ... [ grunting ]
no !
because carmack' s condition is that ... he' s dead .
kid , you and duke ... get back to the dig and you make sure those other dead scientists ... are really dead .
i' ve lost ... four soldiers .
what are you people experimenting with up here ?
i' m not gonna ask you again .
i told you , it' s an archeological research center .
do you think i' m lying to you ?
is that what you' re saying ?
you think i' m hiding something ?
i' m telling the truth .
what were you downloading ?
what were you sent to protect ?
the research data .
research into what ?
subject was injected with study agent at 00 : 03 .
vitals normal , elevated heart rate attributable to subject anxiety .
c 24 successfully grafted to subject' s marker cells at 00 : 09 .
he reconstructed chromosome mutation on a human subject .
we were never gonna do human studies .
what the hell are we looking at ?
genesis , chapter 1 .
subject moved to protected observation area at 00 : 17 .
curtis stahl .
multiple murder .
condemned to execution .
chromosome 24 .
oh , my god .
49 minutes after injection , genetic mutations ... began to visually manifest on subject' s extremities .
this is what you' re here to protect .
it doesn' t make any sense .
you trusted them .
they lied to you .
they used you , sam .
if he perfected xenogenesis ...
christ , don' t you get it ?
it' s this place .
it' s hell .
it always was .
this shit ends here .
what are you doing ?
we need to destroy these discs .
that' s uac property .
fuck uac , we take this back , they' il just ...
we take the data back .
sarge , do you not see what' s going on here ?
i didn' t see shit .
and i ain' t paid to see shit .
i have my orders .
and so do you .
is this everything ?
i said , is this everything ?
i , uh , have three more to download .
then do it .
sarge ?
we got a problem .
0ne dead scientist is missing .
now .
you just wanna leave her here ?
she' s got a job to do .
look , this is portman' s comm .
you call if you need help , okay ?
you gonna be all right ?
i' il be fine .
okay .
i' il see you soon .
pinky , are you there ?
pinky .
sarge ?
something is cutting through the ark door .
you have a visual ?
0h , i got a visual all right .
don' t let it get to the ark !
five .
pinky , use the grenade !
four .
use the goddamn grenade !
three , two .
throw it !
0ne .
pinky' s gone .
that fucker ran .
shit .
it got through .
what the hell is that ?
system reboot .
five minutes .
quarantine cordon is breached .
this mission is no longer containment .
get all the weapons and ammo you can .
we' re going through .
move !
sam , come in .
over .
sam , do you read me ?
over .
come in !
she' s not answering .
time required to begin renewed operation ... four minutes and 45 seconds .
you got three .
sam !
come in , sam !
sam !
sam , why didn' t you answer your comm ?
we gotta go now !
why did they take goat and not destroyer ?
why carmack and not dr. thurman ?
what ?
lucy had the 24th chromosome ... but she wasn' t a monster .
she died protecting her child , not devouring it .
why did the same chromosome that made her superhuman ... turn stahl into a monster ?
let' s go .
just give me a minute .
we don' t have a minute .
then give me 10 seconds .
this is its tongue .
this is brain matter from portman .
this is from destroyer .
it' s choosing , john .
it' s choosing who to infect .
it' s choosing ?
how is it choosing ?
there are genetic markers for psychotic and violent behavior .
it could be a specific neurotransmitter ... it' s picking up on , a ganglion .
latching onto numbers in the dna code linked to ...
linked to what ?
evil ?
ten percent of the human genome is still unmapped .
some say it' s the genetic blueprint for the soul .
maybe c 24 is what destroyed the population .
it would explain why some of them had to build the ark ... to escape to a new beginning .
some it made superhuman .
others , monsters .
oh , my god .
we gotta get out of here now .
what ?
come on , let' s go , come on .
the people quarantined on the other side of the ark ... they won' t all be infected !
what' s going on ?
sarge is going to kill them all .
come on .
we uphold quarantine .
nothing gets to the elevator back on earth .
we can' t let them get to the surface .
if it breathes , kill it .
five ... four , three ... two , one .
ark travel complete .
this is corporal dean portman ... with rrts 6 special 0ps on 0lduvai , 0310 hours .
we have encountered hostile activity .
require immediate rrts reinforcements .
yeah , no shit .
we got 58 minutes before the auto lockdown is lifted .
reset it for another six hours .
i can' t .
it' s been disabled .
same as the topside comm link .
they' re disabling computers now ?
yeah , they' re rocket scientists , remember ?
ark travel complete .
oh , my god .
sarge , what' s your position ?
sarge .
sarge , come in .
do you copy ?
come in , sarge .
do you read me ?
over .
sarge , come in , do you copy ?
loud and clear .
look , do not kill everybody .
i repeat , do not kill everybody .
help me .
they' re not all infected .
help me , help me , please .
do you copy ?
copy that .
help me .
clear the rest of this sector and meet back at the ark chamber .
jesus christ , what the hell are ...
who the hell' s in there ?
well , don' t just stand there , you dumb son of a bitch .
help me up .
it' s okay .
please ... help us .
you don' t have to kill all of them .
i don' t think everyone is infected , or even capable of being infected .
we have orders to contain this threat by any means necessary .
so let' s evacuate the uninfected ... and blow this place to hell .
and we have orders to protect this facility .
we don' t have orders to kill innocent people .
found this little chicken shit hiding under a pile of dead bodies .
am i glad to see you guys .
that thing cut right through the door .
i tried to use the grenade but it came at me too fast .
followed me through the ark and started to kill everybody .
it was horrible .
there' s no wound on his neck .
he' s clean .
i say who' s clean ... and who' s not .
i mean , it wasn' t my fault .
hey , i' m not a soldier .
you shouldn' t have left me ... sarge .
there' s a storeroom to the south .
it' s got , like , 20 people holed up inside of it .
we gotta do something .
your orders were to clear that sector .
is it cleared ?
no , i told them to stay put .
they' re okay .
they' re just scared shitless .
we kill them all .
let god sort them out .
this is wrong .
i think ...
son , you don' t think .
that' s an order .
we' re in the field , soldier .
sarge , if nothing' s found them ...
you will obey the direct order ... of your commanding officer .
no .
now .
go to hell .
no !
no .
holy shit .
mutinous insurrection is punishable ... by death .
it was his first mission !
and it' s not gonna be my last .
i need soldiers .
i don' t need anybody else but soldiers .
drop the weapons .
i mean it .
i have no intention of being killed by a madman .
drop the weapons .
ah , there' s something behind me , isn' t there ?
on me .
get sam .
wait here .
listen .
withdraw !
withdraw behind the nanowall .
move !
i can' t see .
i can' t see .

the wall' s not closing !
i' m not supposed to die .
let' s go .
come on .
clear .
how long before they get through ?
not long .
you' ve been hit .
oh , john .
listen to me , sam .
you' re cold .
shivering .
it' s important .
this is an st grenade .
when they come through ... you pop the top and hit the button .
john , stay with me .
stay awake .
john , stay with me , please .
what' s that ?
it' s c 24 .
it' s from carmack' s lab .
no .
it could save you .
no way , forget it .
you' re bleeding to death .
no way , sam .
i' ve done some bad things .
i know you .
you don' t know me .
you don' t know .
you' re my brother .
i know you .
wait .
wait .
if i should turn into one of those demons .
one through the heart , one through the head ... don' t you hesitate .
okay ?
i won' t need to .
i know you .
you' re my brother .
sam ?
sam .
sam .
sam .
john .
sam .
sam .
sam .

i think she needs medical attention .

i' m not sure .
try .
where are the survivors kid found ?
i took care of that problem .
quarantine' s almost over .
power should be back on any minute .
