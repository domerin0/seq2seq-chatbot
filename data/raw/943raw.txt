yesterday , you were in diapers , and now you' re graduating junior high .
you' re growing up , and i can' t believe you' re going to rome for two weeks all by yourself .
without me .
without me there with you .
without me with you there .
you there without me .
mom , that' s about all the combinations of those words you can make .
lizzie , this is a big day for you , sweetheart .
he' s going to quote a dead guy .
as william shakespeare wrote , " be not afraid of greatness : some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them .
thanks , dad , but i' m just trying to get through graduation .
greatness can wait till this nightmare' s over .
hey , gordo .
so , do i look okay ?
i' m your guy best friend .
you should talk to miranda about this .
but she' s in mexico city .
yes .
your blue robe looks way cooler than all the other girls ' .
oh ... my ... god .
only you would think you could hide that powder blue , puffy sleeved , it' s kind of a peasant dress but it might just be a baggy disaster that you wore to the spring dance .
lizzie mcguire , you are an outfit repeater !
but i ...
maybe i' m an outfit repeater , but you' re an outfit rememberer , which is just as pathetic .
does she not have anything better to do than make my life miserable ?
i mean ... we used to be best friends .
but that was before she became popular .
mcguire !
go .
hey , mr. escobar .
nice after shave .
oh , thank you .
margaret chan either has ebola or a very bad cold .
in any event , you' re up .
u u up where ?
at the podium .
you are going to deliver the class president' s speech .
b but what about the vice president ?
he' s not graduating .
the secretary treasurer' s next in line .
all i did was handle petty cash .
i' m sorry , but you' re not buying your way out of this .
i want you to deliver your speech with as much pride and commitment as margaret chan would , even though you' re no margaret chan .
you' re no margaret chan .
run !
ladies and gentlemen , uh , lizzie mcguire .
um ...
u uh , margaret chan couldn' t make it tonight , so i' m going i' m going to be filling in for her .
not that any of us could really do that , but , um , anyway ...
honey , i' m losing the feeling in my knuckles .
i think that we can all agree that junior high is filled with embarrassing and awkward and sometimes just downright humiliating moments , right ?
uh ...
oh !
me neither .
it is so sad .
wow .
it' s like watching one of those animals get killed on the discovery channel .
i i think margaret chan would want me to have some water right now .
uhh !
oh !
play something !
do something !
yes !
ha ha ha !
come on !
mom !
dad !
i' ve got to get out of the country !
i know you' re still upset , but it wasn' t that bad .
oh , really , mom ?
was your junior high graduation on " good morning america " ?
what creep would send diane sawyer a video to embarrass you like that ?
oh .
ugh !
what is that ?
that is miss ungermeyer .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
hey !
she' s gonna be our principal for the next four years .
if you stay on her good side , it' s a one way ticket to an lvy league school .
what if you' re on her bad side ?
excuse me !
i need to mop up some puke .
well , you ...
you wind up as that guy ?
no .
you end up working for that guy .
can you make sure there are no garlic or soy products in anything brittany puts near her mouth ?
miss ungermeyer , luke has tennis elbow .
could somebody carry his luggage ?
my son has asthma , and he must have his puffer .
brittany , she' s got allergies .
attention , parents ... shut your pie holes .
i' m on a mission here to drag your progeny to 31 historically significant roman landmarks in two weeks .
now , when these back talking miscreants return to you , they will have dipped their toes in a lake of culture , before assuming their destiny folding shirts at the outlet mall .
many actually , most of your classmates opted for the 36 hour bus ride to the water slide wonderland .
whoo !
but you ... you , who are not mouth breathing trailer trash , you will get to experience the delights of la citta eterna !
hmm hmm .
rome .
the eternal city .
did no one read the info packets ?
watch and learn .
um , miss ungermeyer ,
i just wanted to let you know i' m really looking forward to this exciting and academically enriching trip .
what' s your name ?
david gordon .
david gordon .
mm hmm .
i think , in ltalian , that means a sneaky brownnoser with a hidden agenda , huh ?
uh , uh .
yeah !
come on , check those bags !
i want to see that junk in the trunk and a seat looking neat .
okay .
mom ...
okay , it' s only two weeks , mom .
honey , she' s got to go .
two weeks .

sweetheart ...

mm hmm .
flight 72 to rome .

hey !
we' re going to the land where they invented spaghetti !
ah heh .
yeah , and the best part is
kate and all the little teeth whitening friends who' d be ragging on me for messing up graduation went to water slide wonderland .
how many lizzies does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
i don' t know , but it only takes one to screw up a graduation .
hey .
zip it .
whoa !
down each avenue or via , street or strata
you can see ' em disappearing two by two
on an evening in roma
do they take ' em for espresso ?
yeah , i guess so
on each lover' s arm , a girl i wish i knew

but in rome , do as the romans do
will you ?
on an evening in roma
here we are .
step right up .
number one ...
number two ...
welcome to the hotel cambini .
lest you think there are many of you and less of me and it will therefore be easy to pull anything over on me , think again .
in addition to being smarter , faster , and better looking than most of you ,
i' ve also enlisted a little help .
the assistant manager of the hotel , giorgio averni , was a commander in the ltalian navy and is therefore as up on his game as i am mine .
giorgio , would you like to brief my students on the security procedures of the hotel ?
we serve at 5 : 00 .
the cookies .
yeah .
you heard the man .
room assignments .
david gordon ... you will be rooming with ethan craft .
you' il be in room 103 .
are those english or ltalian numbers ?
you got a problem with that ?
um , no , ma' am .
any room is just just fine for me .
being a spineless jellyfish is almost as unattractive as being a little brownnoser .
mcguire !
seeing as how margaret chan was unable to make the trip , you will be rooming with ...
okay , i am not , under any circumstances , sharing a room with
i' il be taking the bed by the window .
you don' t mind , do you ?
uh , ye e e e s !
no .
i sleep much better with the swiss eiderdown .
lizzie , seeing as we' re roomies and we' re gonna be spending time together ,
i wanted to let you know i understand you want to put all that embarrassing stuff behind you and just move on and have a fresh start .
you do ?
yes .
i understand your dream .
it' s a big dream .
it' s a huge dream , and you can' t do it alone .
in fact , i don' t think you can do it at all .
let it go .
lizzie , come on .
whoa !
gordo , what ?
don' t worry .
don' t worry .
where are we going ?
look .
wow !
pretty cool , huh ?
you know what , gordo ?
i' m not gonna let kate sanders get to me .
promise me something .
anything .
promise that when we' re here , we' il find adventures .
all right ?
this is our chance to start over .
i mean , do anything that we want to do .
yeah .
i i know .
you' re right .
hmm .
you and me .
adventures .
deal .
deal .
the trevi fountain was designed by gian lorenza bernini and peitro da cortona in the 17th century .
and it took about 100 years to finish this bad boy .
throughout history , people have come from all over the world to make a wish and toss their coin in the trevi fountain .
those people are suckers .
you got to make your own luck in this world .
all right , moving on , people .
let' s go .
scusi ,
grazie .
scusi , grazie ,
you know what ?
forget what she says .
make a wish .
i' m in rome with my best friend .
i' m good .
you make one .
okay .
hmm .
okay .
lsabella ?
huh ?
okay , i was wishing for smooth sailing through high school , but this will work .
uh , i' m sorry .
it' s just you look an awful lot like a friend of mine .
paolo , you have to get to your photo shoot .
we got to go .
what you little halflings are feeling right about now is your energy flagging .
we got four more stops today .
i want you to at least be able to shuffle from monument to monument .
we got one word for that , and it' s gelato .
keep in mind that ltalian ice cream has about twice the sugar of american ice cream .
means you' re gonna want about two scoops , huh ?
i know i do .
all right .
i don' t mean to bother you .
i' m paolo .
paolo valisari .
oh , um , i' m lizzie mcguire , and this is my friend gordo .
this is my friend sergei .
sergei , doesn' t she look exactly like lsabella ?
lsabella !
paolo !
um ...
paolo !
lsabella !
isabella !
paolo !
paolo !
ciao , paolo !
uh , hmm ...
wow !
that really does look like me .
except for the hair , you could be her twin .
isabella is my singing partner , and you' re like her sister .
like two pods in a pea .
lizzie , can i see you again ?
maybe tomorrow ?
please ?
what' s the word for " yes " in ltalian ?
si ,
uh ...
no , i' m
it' s okay .
i can cover for you .
head check !
i' m sorry .
i' m here with my school , so i can' t .
forgive me if i embarrassed you .
some people , when they come to rome , they want to find adventure .
oh , it' s okay .
i got some cool cheese .
did you just say " cool cheese " ?
wah !
paolo ...
we must go .
uh , lizzie , if you change your mind ,
i will meet you tomorrow morning at the trevi fountain at 9 : 00 .
hey , gordon , mcguire , did you not hear me say " head check " ?
15 , 16 .
who are you ?
paolo valisari .
put your money in your front pockets .
she makes me very scared .
join the club .
lizzie ...
ci vediamo ,
what does that mean ?
we will see each other .
hey .
this paolo and lsabella cd isn' t so bad .
i mean , if you' re into the alanis morissette y , alternative , dark , like , brooding ,
i never go out and my life' s a black hole of depression kind of thing , you' d think they stink .
for driving around in the car with the top down ,
ioving life kind of thing , they' re good .
here .
listen .
you don' t have to sail the ocean
yeah , not bad .
you use scented soap , huh ?
what ?
um , it n never never mind .
so , paolo wants me to meet him at the trevi fountain tomorrow .
so go .
that would mean i would have to sneak away from the group .
so ?
i' m incapable of sneaking .
weren' t you the one that said we were gonna have adventures on this trip ?
yeah .
we .
we were going to have adventures .
and we will .
it just so happens that you have dibs on the first one .
okay .
just as long as we don' t do anything that would get us tossed on a plane home .
uh .
unh .
lizzie , are are you feeling okay ?
is this girl sick , or isn' t she ?
she doesn' t have a fever , and yet she' s in bed .
ask yourself why a beautiful young girl on her first visit to rome , probably seeking adventure , wants to lie in bed all day .
she' s ill .
i heard she fell down at graduation , made a complete fool out of herself .
i saw that on cnn .
cnn ?
often , the nervous system collapses after that type of humiliation .
hmm .
do you have any recommendations ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
this young woman should stay in bed .
uh , she she should also eat two apricots .
oh , for digestion or ...
no , they' re in season .
very delicious .
feel better , signorina mcguire .
you rest up , mcguire .
don' t want you to miss all the adventures of rome .
uh , doctor , i have a boil ...
sorry .
uno , due , tre ,
tre , tre ,
bene ,
i i just i had them all wish for you to come .
hmm ...
i don' t have much time .
you know my chaperon
wait , wait , wait .
i have to show you something .
sometimes the world
is a valley of heartaches and tears
come on .
and in the hustle and bustle , no sunshine appears
but you and i have a love always there to remind us ...
wow !
you should see rome the way romans do .
so you knew that i would come .
i hoped you would .
are you sure you know how to drive this thing ?
this is rome .
nobody knows how to drive .
volare
oh , oh
cantare
oh , oh , oh , oh
let' s fly way up to the clouds
away from the maddening crowds
we can sing in the glow of a star that i know of
where lovers enjoy peace of mind
let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
just like birds of a feather
and the rainbow together we' il find
volare
oh , oh
cantare
oh , oh , oh , oh
whoo !
volare
oh , oh
cantare
oh , oh , oh , oh
no wonder my happy heart sings
your love has given me wings
no wonder my happy heart sings
your love has given me wings
wow !
i don' t know what catastrophe is going to happen in rome , but with lizzie there , something will .
what are you going to do with that information ?
give it away , like you did with the graduation video ?
hey !
she was really freaked out by that .
and you have what to show for it ?
the pride of a job well done ?
try buying a ps2 with the pride of a job well done .
oh !
matt , matt , matt .
we' ve been over this before .
cash up front .
melina , are you staying for dinner ?
i' d love to , mrs. mcguire .
great .
we' il need extra energy to work on our summer reading list .
in that case , i' il make brownies .
oh .
i' ve said it before .
you' re weak .
weak !
don' t do anything without consulting me first .
you rock .
hey , paolo , can i ask you something ?
si , carina ,
um , i know that our lives are a little different .
actually , like , several universes different .
but doesn' t sergei get tired of following us around ?
actually , sergei' s my bodyguard .
so , you see , between me and sergei , you' il always be safe .
whoa !
how famous do you have to be before you need a bodyguard ?
paolo , go !
go !
i it' s miss ungermeyer !
it' s our bus !
go !
i cannot .
miss ungermeyer , didn' t we just pass the castel sant' angelo ?
yep .
what about it ?
i just noticed it' s not on our itinerary .
that is correct .
well , s shouldn' t it be ?
i i mean , it was a papal residence and it does contain frescoes from artists influenced by the school of raphael .
what are you up to , gordon ?
n n nothing .
i i just figure that , while in rome , we should be exposed to as much renaissance , raphaelite work typified by chiaroscuro and hellenic mythical imagery as humanly possible .
whew .
ah , gordon , you are on the list , and the list is not a place you want to be .
what is this ?
only in rome , huh ?
you know how to move that , or you want me to do it for you ?
what are you looking at ?
want a piece of that , a piece of the ungermeyer ?
over there by that statue .
you see it ?
yeah .
that' s where the artist caravaggio had his opponent burned at the stake .
or was it the pope who had caravaggio burned at the stake ?
either way , this neighborhood was tough .
paolo ...
si , carina ?
do you still love her ?
who ?
isabella ?
si ,
of course i still love her .
but like a sister .
so , why did you break up ?
it' s , um , it' s complicated .
what ?
yes , we' ve been voted " best pop duo of the year " again .
but i want to do more serious music .
and when i told this to lsabella , she said flat out " no .
i was forced to tell her , " this is it .
this will be our last cd together .
did she totally freak out ?
she totally freak out .
i feel awful about that , but what about me ?
i need to grow as an artist .
yeah .
so , the other day when i saw you ,
i just i don' t know , i had this crazy
i just i don' t know .
w what ?
i had this crazy idea that maybe you could help me .
come on .
how crazy could it be ?
just tell me .
no , i can' t .
it' s too it' s too ...
please .
okay .
isabella and i are supposed to present an award together at the international music video awards .
cool !
i i mean , cool for regular people like me , but for you , i guess it' s like work .
no , no , no .
it' s cool for me , too .
you get all kinds of free stuff .
but now because lsabella' s so mad at me , she' s refusing to appear .
the record company' s threatening to sue if she doesn' t show up .
what about you ?
for me is no problem .
i write the music .
i don' t know where it comes from .
it just comes from me .
la la la la
see ?
so i can go solo .
but lsabella ...
she needs the help to sing .
you mean lsabella lip synchs ?
please , please !
promise me you will speak of this to no one .
imagine what would happen to lsabella' s career .
oh , that' s so sweet .
you still care about her .
you' re definitely broken up , right ?
si ,
so , when i saw you yesterday and how people thought you were lsabella ,
i got my crazy idea that maybe you could pretend to be lsabella and present the award with me onstage .
present an award ?
o onstage ?
in front of an audience ?
i i i' m really not good in front of crowds .
i could never do that .
of course you can do it .
you are magnifico .
i don' t know ltalian , but i know what that means .
i don' t know , paolo .
i ...
don' t worry , carina ,
i could never ask you to do this crazy thing .
no .
you know what ?
you don' t have to ask .
if this is gonna help you and lsabella , then ... ... i' il do it .
grazie !
prego !
head check !
gordo .
gordo .
you , lizzie mcguire , are actually presenting an award at the lmvas with paolo ?
no .
me lsabella with paolo .
what ?
it' s a long story .
i' m doing it because lsabella won' t .
you' re gonna get up onstage in front of all these people ?
that' s the great thing .
it' s not gonna be me .
it' s paolo' s idea to help lsabella because he still loves her .
but not romantically .
like a sister .
he is so amazing .
and he' s 17 !
for being so famous and used to getting everything that you want , he' s just he' s just so kind .
for real ?
that' s a lot to say about someone just knowing them a day .
i i know that .
but i feel like i' ve known him my whole life .
anyway , um ...
i just wanted to come by and thank you .
i had the most magical day of my life .
it wouldn' t have happened if it weren' t for you .
it was that good , huh ?
you' re such a good friend .
the sting .
what sting ?
you want a little mano a mano ?
see , this is one of the reasons me and you aren' t friends .
i never have any idea what you' re talking about .
some dudes get the approach .
others , the sting .
that ltalian dude .
he' s big time approach .
i actually feel my brain turning into goo .
embrace the sting .
that' s what you' re vibin ' from lizzie .
wait a minute .
now , you actually think that i' m jealous of paolo ?
word .
oh , no .
no , see , that would mean that i like lizzie as more than a friend .
you and i have trouble communicating ?
you' re wrong , man .
whoa !
this girl looks freakishly like my sister !
ow .
zoom !
zoom !
another freakish coincidence .
i mean , she has the same necklace as my sister' s .
huh .
why do we even pretend you' re in charge ?
let' s see what this says .
ow .
lsabella goes blond .
italian pop duo paolo and lsabella wowed the crowd outside a shop near the trevi fountain , showing off lsabella' s new blond hair .
they must think that lizzie is this famous singer !
and if i show this to my mom , lizzie will be so busted !
if you show this to your mom , it' s worth nothing .
but if you show this to the ltalian tabloids , we will be rolling in cash , my friend .
interesting !
we " ?
not up to toughing it out on the streets with us ?
i could try , miss ungermeyer .
no , i just hate seeing you being denied the cultural experience of being in a foreign country .
you missed seven points of historical significance yesterday .
i know .
it' s really killing me too , miss ungermeyer .
which is why i thought i' d bring you something to help ease the pain , hmm ?
mmh , well , that' s really thoughtful of you .
seeing as how your teeny tiny little body doesn' t have the strength , we' re gonna have to let your mind do the wandering .
ah !
the rise and decline of the roman empire , " hmm ?
i' d like one report on the rise and one on the decline .
ouch !
if i didn' t have a headache a minute ago , i do now .
you don' t have a problem with that , do you ?
um , no .
what else do i have to do ?
why not
take a crazy chance ?
why not
do a crazy dance ?
if you lose the moment
you might lose a lot
so why not ?
why not ?
why not take a crazy chance ?
wow .
i am so grateful for your help .
you' re doing a very kind thing for lsabella .
uh , paolo , where are we ?
via condotti .
one of the most expensive shopping districts in the world .
we must find you the perfect outfit .
ah !
oh , hey , lsabella , paolo !
ciao !
your hair is so blond and , uh , innocent .
who did it ?
um ...
the island we were on was really , really sunny , so it was j just the sun .
we must get sun , too , no ?
ciao , bella !
ciao , ciao , ciao .
they are so tall !
they all want to be you .
they want to be lsabella .
sit and i' il get franca .
i will just be a moment .
whoa !
take your time .
i' il just be sitting here in heaven .
hard as it is to imagine , as we look at the ruins of the forum , that this was once the center of commerce , religion , and politics in ancient rome .
all right , now , the forum came into being in the sixth century b. c. , and with it , a new urban culture was born .
uh , um , di
yeah , craft ?
is it time for the spaghetti ?
it' s 9 : 00 in the morning .
so ?
you never had leftover spaghetti for breakfast ?
i don' t eat carbs .
you never had a spaghetti sandwich , either ?
this cultural experience is , like , so wasted on you .
excuse me , where did you buy that prada bag ?
craft !
sanders !
separate .
we did , miss ungermeyer .
and thank god .
why don' t you people , uh , do something at your , uh , skill level here ?
take a 10 minute shopping break while i choke down an espresso .
this dude definitely spent too much time on his biceps and not enough on his abs .
totally old school .
wha
nice spy , bro .
yeah , watch and learn .
the slow curve .
works every time .
i' ve got to talk to them .
that' s not how the slow curve works .
they come to us .
um , eh , ciao .
ciao .
ciao .

yes .

yeah , sure .

oh , lsabella .

tacky bad .
we' il have to fix that .
okay , none of these are me .
why are you laughing at me ?
you' re not supposed to be you .
if i have to go onstage as lsabella , then i i' m gonna have to be confident , and that' s the thing i' m worst at .
we are all the same that way .
not you .
yes , me , and lsabella , too .
it' s how she works through her fears that makes her strong .
isabella doesn' t let franca di montecatini tell her what to wear .
isabella tells franca .
okay , so you' re telling me to tell franca di monteca teca tecatini how i should dress ?
si ,
test your strength .
vai !
vai , vai ,
you don' t like my clothes ?
no .
no .
i i love your clothes .
but i don' t want you to dress me .
what ? !
see , i' m not your barbie doll .
i am lsabella parigi , and i dress myself .
so , choices .
i i need choices .
whoa .
i really like these two .
you pick .
both .
wow .
this is the exact color i wore to my spring formal .
danny kessler thought ...

mmh .
ooh , ooh , ooh

forever in my heart

you make me feel like a star
ooh , ooh , ooh

ooh , ooh , ooh
i' m ready for my close up .
whoo !
i cannot believe that not one roman guy has asked me out yet .

uh , uh ...

okay !
hello .
hotel cambini .
this is giorgio .
go !
huh ?
what ?
wait .
excuse me , can you fix this ?
it will not close .
why is it open when there is no rain ?
this umbrella is stubborn .
it' s bad luck to have an open umbrella inside .
in hotel cambini , no bad luck .
hey , thanks .
ah !
one at a time .
no running .
ha ha ha !
ha !
ha ha !
age before beauty , huh ?
you look strangely large and familiar .
which floor ?
oh .
thank you .
first .
okay .
little hint for you you want to push the button , elevator moves .
elevator is not safe .
you an employee here ?
no .
no .
who are you to tell me whether the elevator' s safe ?
i am sergei .
sergei .
you' re gonna have to stand down immediately .
just because you are one hunk of slavic muscle does not mean you' re not gonna make it on my list !
elevator is safe now .
hey !
your umbrella !
feeling any better ?
mom ?
still a little warm .
miss sanders , would you be so kind as to look after her for me ?
as in do stuff for her ?
why should i be punished ?
i' m not the one who' s sick .
next year , i' m joining the mouth breathers at water slide wonderland .
you are so busted .
you' ve been out of this hotel room .
what ?
how do you know ?
please .
your eyebrows finally match , your hair has highlights , fresh manicure .
i smelled acetone the second i walked in the lobby .
okay , but you didn' t rat me out to miss ungermeyer .
yet .
not until i figure out what' s in it for me .
now spill , dorkerella .
you' il never make me talk !
i i know that this sounds insane , but i think paolo really does like me .
how could this happen ?
how did you get my trip ?
how is lizzie mcguire living this fantasy and i can' t even get an ltalian boy to buy me a plate of spaghetti ?
um , kate , you don' t eat spaghetti .
i' d eat carbs if an ltalian boy bought them for me .
so , i suppose you want me to keep quiet about this ?
yeah .
i' d appreciate that .
well , i' il keep it quiet if you keep it quiet about me keeping it quiet .
and when we get back home , i' m the cool one again , and you turn back into a pumpkin .
oh , my god .
it' s her .
what are you doing ?
uh , it' s a long story .
what do you want ?
we' re closed .
i i just wanted to talk to lizzie .
so talk .
i was kind of thinking maybe , you know , outside in the courtyard .
if this is about that parallel universe ,
italian rock star , lizzie' s suddenly a diva thing ,
i know all about it .
she figured it out .
evil and smart .
embrace it .
fear it .
you might want to take a look at this .
i' m on the front cover of a tabloid !
i wish to thank everyone who' s always believed in me for this great honor .
do you know what that says ?
paolo and lsabella are supposed to be singing at the music awards .
well , it' s got to be a mistake .
i had some ltalian girls translate it .
paolo didn' t tell you ?
mmh , no .
don' t you think it' s weird he tried to hide this ?
can you believe it ?
maybe it' s a last minute thing .
aren' t these things planned months in advance ?
when did you become an expert on ltalian award show thingies ?
it' s called common sense , which i have a lot of to make up for my lack of the slow curve .
slow curve ?
forget it .
if you want to believe some ltalian kid you think you know after two days because he' s an international superstar , is really rich and has nice hair , be my guest .
gordo .
oh , my god !
he' s early !
lizzie .
oh , my god , i gotta get dressed .
i' il cover for you in case miss ungermeyer does one of her middle of the night , head check things .
thanks .
i owe you .
duh !
mom , dad , i found something on the internet
i think you both should see .
what is it ?
since lizzie' s in europe ,
i thought i' d do a little e search on ltaly .
that' s nice , son .
but what i found out , it' s not so e assuring .
in fact , it may shock you .
what are we looking at ?
maybe nothing , and , uh , maybe something .
you see , when polled , 74 % of ltalian teenage boys said they would most like to date american girls .
where' d you get these numbers ?
they' re available for anyone who has a computer .
you don' t have to worry about your sister .
she' s well chaperoned .
miss ungermeyer' s there .
yeah , what is she , 5' 1 " , 5' 2 " max ?
oh , please .
matt , as interesting as this is , where are you taking it ?
all right , you caught me .
i always do .
i don' t know why i even try .
i' il deny i ever said this , but ... ... i miss my sister .
there .
i said it .
now you know .
i know i rag on her all the time , but now that she' s gone , i i
oh , honey , we miss her , too .
so , so much .
i feel so alone !
oh !
listen to me .
you don' t have to make fake pie charts .
you just come to us with the truth , okay ?
i know that now , mom .
it' s just so hard .
i miss her so much !
oh !
i can' t believe i let you talk me into
ietting her go on that trip !
i' il go get the passports .
oh , honey .
shh .
hmm , hmm , hmm .
ah , hmm , ah .
hmm .
uh ...
hmm , hmm , hmm , hmm , hmmmm .
hmm ?
hmm .
hmm !
paolo .
si ,
what is this ?
uh , a car .
look , are we supposed to sing ?
scusa ?
don' t speak to me in ltalian .
it' s too adorable .
are paolo and lsabella supposed to sing at the awards ?
si ,
si ? !
well , why didn' t you tell me ?
i wanted to , but you told me not to telephone the hotel .
get in .
i' il explain everything on the way .
i want to show you the tivoli gardens before sunset .
come on .
we have to get you back by 10 : 00 .
okay .
so , where is sergei ?
you' re not the only one who sneaks off at night .
lsabella and i were going to sing , but after lsabella would not speak to me ,
i told the producers we refuse to perform .
i said lsabella had throat problems .
so , what happened ?
i mean , what changed ?
isabella did .
the real lsabella or me lsabella ?
you .
a reporter heard her speaking , and he reported lsabella' s voice was fine .
he said her english was very good .
the record company called , and they' re going to sue if we don' t sing .
what ?
so , they' re gonna make you sing ?
i i mean , us sing ?
don' t worry , carina , i' il make this work .
look .
ah !
look , paolo , i i don' t think this is going to work .
i cannot sing in front of an audience .
i won' t even let my mom hear me sing in the shower .
i will teach you all you need to know .
okay .
so , what is lsabella gonna do when she sees me being her ?
she won' t .
she' s off on some island trying to get over this .
come on .
here' s my vow to you .
i , paolo valisari , will never let you , lizzie mcguire , be embarrassed .
if i fail , i have to spend seven days with that scary head check woman .
her name' s miss ungermeyer .
carina , hasn' t everything i' ve promised you come to be ?
everyone believes you are lsabella .
you' re having the time of your life .
you even told franca di montecatini to buzz off !
don' t you trust that we can do the singing together ?
i guess .
well , you shouldn' t .
hmmm mmmm
ohhh
ye e e ah
you' ve been searching the world to find true love
looking in all the wrong places
when all of the time , you' ve been blind to love
it' s plain as the nose on your face is
it' s here
it' s now
open your eyes and see it
right here
right now
ohh
this is so beautiful .
yes , you are .
ohhhh
love has been right by your side
oh , so close , that you couldn' t see
if love could speak , it would shout to the sky
i' ve always been here , i always will be
wow !
i' m here
i' m now
open your eyes and see
right here
right now
open your eyes to love
open your heart
to love
hey .
what do you got there , little man ?
uh , nothing .
what' s this ?
uh , that' s not lizzie !
no !
yes , it is .
no , it isn' t .
i know my daughter .
i gave her that necklace .
all right , tell me what you know that i don' t .
it' s only a 14 hour flight , dad .
swallow those biscotti .
we got a big day .
the pantheon , the colosseum .
oh .
uh , halt !
got to get these apricots to mcguire .
she looked sick as a dog this morning .
mr. gordon , you having a problem ?
n no , i just ...
i' m starting to agree with ethan .
we need to eat more spaghetti .
you da man !
sorry .
is there a reason you don' t want me to go upstairs ?
no , i i just really think we should get going .
uh , so much roma , so little time a .
well , when i get upstairs and i will get upstairs
i expect to find miss mcguire in her bed .
she may be in the bathroom or or something .
i' m beginning to get the feeling she was never sick to begin with .
no , no , no !
she she was !
i bet this whole thing was just a clever ruse to sneak out of this hotel , wasn' t it ?
yeah , it it was .
it was ?
well , lizzie and i were talking about adventures , and i don' t know .
ah , spit it out , gordon .
lizzie' s upstairs .
it it' s me .
i' m the one who' s been sneaking out .
you ?
but but
feels good to get it off my chest .
you realize what this means ?
i shouldn' t look to you for a college recommendation ?
you should look for your suitcase , gordon .
you' re goin ' home .
oh , i pegged you right from the start .
david gordon .
sneaky little brownnoser with a hidden agenda .
well , you' re busted .
love lifts us up where we belong .
wow .
this place is so cool .
si ,
are you sure it' s okay we' re here ?
si ,
and here is where , exactly ?
it' s the rehearsal hall .
but the colosseum will look more like this .
sergei !
if you want to convince the world you' re lsabella , you must take the stage .
you must dance ...
... and sing .
have you ever seen such a beautiful night ?
just move your mouth with the words .
oh .
so you want me to lip synch .
si ,
just like lsabella .
you know the song , right ?
uh , well , yeah .
i mean , i have your cd , but ...
so try it .
i' m not gonna try it .
okay .
have you ever seen such a beautiful night ?
i could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright
was it awful ?
uh , yes .
but it helps to sing .
really really sing ?
it looks more real when you' re lip synching .
you weren' t singing .
but i won' t be lip synching .
no one' s going to hear you .
the microphone will be off .
you must try .
please ?
okay .
have you ever seen such a beautiful night ?
i could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright
when i see you smiling
i go , " oh , oh , oh
i would never want to miss this
' cause in my heart i know what this is
this is what dreams are made of
this is what
dreams are made of
i' ve got
somewhere i belong
i' ve got
somebody to love
this is what
dreams
are made of
brava .
and now we dance !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
i' m glad you' re up .
i had the most amazing night .
i' m gonna grab gordo so i can tell you together .
you won' t find him .
what ?
why ?
where' d he go ?
probably getting on a plane right now .
why ?
he totally covered for you and got himself kicked off the trip .
i i don' t believe it .
w why would he do that ?
you' re seriously asking that question ?
call the airline and see if gordo' s plane has left !
do you know what flight ?
si , si ,
i will call .
i cannot believe gordo would do this for me .
maybe he' s not on the plane yet .
maybe i could go to the airport and ...
and what ?
i don' t know .
i am now on hold .
this is the final call for lufthansa flight 6240 , departing for los angeles .
mm hmm .
mm hmm .
mm hmm .
thank you very nice .
the plane is gone .
who is this girl ?
i have been on the island , trying to forget about this whole situation .
can somebody tell me what is going on ?
i can .
that' s my friend lizzie mcguire .
let him go .
let him go .
i demand you tell me everything you know about lizzie mcguire .
i demand you tell me everything about paolo valisari .
i left him and all thoughts about him on the island .
you may have left him on the island , but lizzie is out there pretending to be you so you don' t get sued .
we need to talk in private .
gordo' s life is ruined because of me .
selfish me !
what are you gonna do now ?
it' s over .
i' m going to turn myself in to miss ungermeyer .
lizzie , you' il get sent home , and you won' t be able to help paolo .
i' m never going to be able to get through this the way i feel now .
okay .
fine .
quit .
but then everything gordo did will be for nothing .
now , you know things are bad when kate starts making sense .
i know one thing' s for sure .
what ?
i' m not gonna have to act sick today .
mr. craft , you are in the most historic and beautiful city in the world .
has it had no effect on you ?
well , actually , it has .
the cobblestones are shredding my wheels .
switched to a pair of birdhouse pterodactyls .
have you even made a dent in your reading list ?
i finished it .
you read 11 books ?
i mean i read the list .
shh .
shh .
mcguire .
lizzie mcguire .
si , si , we are in the travel guides .
no .
no .
no .
we' re the parents of lizzie .
ah !
si !
i' il call a cab .
it' s very far .
anybody else want to step up to the plate ?
who' s asking for mcguire ?
i had left you four messages already , but she' s been under my watchful eye all the while .
where' d sanders go ?
lizzie ?
sweetheart ?
honey ?
cool !
where is lizzie ?
do you have any embarrassing photos or videos of her while she' s been here ?
ow .
uh ...
tell us where lizzie is , or this deck' s gonna catch air .
it' s possible she' s at the international music video awards doubling for pop star lsabella , who' s totally her twin .
why does everyone always look at me like that ?
when you wish upon a star
your dreams will take you very far
once you see your light so clear
in the sky so very dear
you' re a shining star
no matter who you are
shining bright to see
what you can truly be
prince william ?
tell him he' il have to hold .
ooh !
oh .
shine its watchful light on you
hey , paolo !
words of wisdom , yes , i can
you' re a shining star
no matter who you are
shining bright to see
what you can truly be
si ,
what ?
he said for you to enter from here , stage right , and i must enter from stage left .
what about my dress ?
i have to get dressed .
it' s in your dressing room .
lizzie , you have time .
calm down .
you can do it .
of course i can do it .
this is moi we' re talking about .
i don' t think i can do it .
lizzie , you must .
we' ve rehearsed this .
you know the steps , the words .
you will be great .
i know .
how do you know ?
because .
because you shine like the light from the sun .
paolo .
paolo .
31 minutes till showtime .
lizzie .
gordo !
what are you doing here ? !
lizzie , that' s not important right now .
you need to listen to me .
i feel so bad .
i cannot believe you would do that for me .
why aren' t you gone ?
long story .
i want to hear it , but i' ve got to get my dress on .
listen to me .
paolo is setting you up .
what are you talking about ?
actually , he is setting me up .
freaky , huh ?
way freaky .
way , way freaky .
that whole story about paolo doing his own music and going solo .
that' s lsabella .
she' s the one that sings live .
paolo is the one that lip synchs , not me .
isabella wants to quit the act .
paolo is just a liar .
this has all been some scheme to set you up and embarrass you onstage so it looks like lsabella can' t sing .
si , si , it' s true .
paolo wants to destroy lsabella' s career .
but paolo would never do that to me .
i don' t believe you .
isabella ...
lizzie , who are you going to believe , this boy you are knowing your whole life or this boy you are just meeting who says ,
you shine with the light from the sun " ?
okay .
well , then , you' re here now , so go and sing .
but i am not blond .
paolo will know that it' s me , and he' il make an excuse to leave .
but if we want to get back at him in front of the whole world on live tv , we must make him sing .
and really sing , not lip synch .
how ?
what am i supposed to do ?
i can' t sing live !
change !
change !
change your clothes and go up there and do what you rehearsed .
everything will be fine , i i promise .
i have a plan .
what plan ?
28 minutes till showtime .
so , what' s the plan ?
i don' t know .
no , see , it doesn' t matter about the tickets , because my daughter is back there impersonating a famous pop star , so i got to get in !
that' s what everyone says .
enough of this !
uhh !
uhh !
let' s go !
did paolo bring the voice track for me ?
no .
no , he did not .
there is no track .
paolo says you' re gonna sing live , like you always do .
paolo and lsabella !
sandro , turn down lsabella' s mike .
what' s that ?
turn down the mike !
have you ever seen such a beautiful night ?
i could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright
when i see you smiling , i go
oh , oh , oh
i would never want to miss this
' cause in my heart
i know what this is
this is what dreams are made of
sing to me , paolo .
this is what dreams are made of
okay .
say buonasera to my new american friend , lizzie mcguire !
paolo tried to use her to fool all of you into thinking i could not sing .
lizzie mcguire is nice girl .
you try to hurt her .
let me go , sergei .
you work for me .
not anymore , paolo .
i quit .
paolo !
paolo cannot sing music .
now he must face music .
was it all a lie ?
no , it' s just ...
do you want to hear us sing ?

lizzie got everything you' re supposed to get when you go to europe .
adventure , romance , total confidence .
yeah ?
well , if all that can happen to lizzie mcguire , the only thing i know now is i don' t know anything .
that' s hot .
what ?
girls who think they know everything are just a turnoff .
really ?
oh , totally .
what about you not ratting out lizzie ?
i mean , that was just so ... not you .
that' s good .
si ,
aaaaaaah !
mom , dad , i' m so glad that you guys made it .
you would have never believed me .
that is for sure .
i thought after you found out all i did , i would be grounded .
you' re grounded for the rest of the summer , sweetheart , but we' re really proud of you .
lying , even for a good reason , is beneath you , gordon .
yeah .
i know .
i know .
i' m a lying , spineless , brownnosing jellyfish with a hidden agenda .
i got it .
that may be true , but i' il tell you something .
little miss diva told me everything .
the way i see it , you' re a pretty loyal friend , gordon .
and loyalty goes a long way with the ungermeyer .
hmm ?
thanks .
hey , just think about it .
we got 4 years of high school to look forward to together .
ooh .
sammies .
sergei is hungry .
so is miss ungermeyer .
you are strong woman .
you protect cubs like lioness .
sergei is impressed .
hmm .
you' re still on my list .
as long as i am at the top .
hey , there !
i bet you' re wondering , who is this lizzie mcguire , where did she come from , and what are her most embarrassing moments ?
well , i can give you total access to all of that for a very competitive price .
hmm .
when in rome ...
yeah , yeah .
do as the romans do , right ?
no .
we do not blackmail our sisters .
as a former commander in the ltalian navy ,
i am ordering you to leave the country .
no !
hey .
so , one last sneak away for old times ' sake ?
yeah .
sounds good .
okay .
aha .
no !
so , are you gonna miss it here ?
i don' t know .
kate says i should stay and have my stuff shipped over , because when i leave , it' il never be the same .
she' s wrong , as usual .
you didn' t have to be in rome for all this to happen .
you think ?
trust me .
you had it in you the whole time .
gordo ?
what ?
thanks .
you' re welcome .
yeah .
so , um , want to get back to that party so we don' t get in any more trouble ?
yeah .
i can' t afford any more trouble .
yeah .
why not ?
think you' re goin ' nowhere
when you' re walkin ' down the street
acting like you just don' t care
when life can be so sweet
but why you want to be like that
as if there' s nothing new ?
you' re not foolin ' no one
you' re not even foolin ' you
so walk a little slower and open up your eyes
sometimes it' s so hard to see the good things passin ' by
and there may never be a sign , no flashing neon light
telling you to make your move when the time is right
why not
take a crazy chance ?
why not
do a crazy dance ?
if you lose the moment , you might lose a lot
so why not ?
why not ?
oh , i could be the one for you
oh , yeah , maybe yes , maybe no
oh , it could be the thing to do
what i' m sayin ' is you got to let me know , oh , oh
ah , ah , yeah
ah , ah , ah
yeah , yeah
ah , ah , ah , yeah
ah , yeah
ah , yeah , yeah
you' il never get to heaven or even to l, a ,
if you don' t believe there' s a way
why not
take a star from the sky ?
why not
spread your wings and fly ?
it might take a little , and it might take a lot
but why not ?
why not ?
why not
take a crazy chance ?
why not
do a crazy dance ?
if you lose the moment , you might lose a lot
so why not ?
why not ?
hmmmmmm , mmmm , mmmm
ohhhhh , yeah
you' ve been searching the world
to find true love
looking in all the wrong places
when all of the time , you' ve been blind to love
it' s plain as the nose on your face is
it' s here , it' s now
open your eyes and see it
right here , right now
open your eyes to love
you' ve been down on yourself , thinking something' s wrong
wondering why love has never found you

if only you' d look around you ?
it' s here
it' s now
open your eyes and see it
right here
right now
open your eyes to love
love has been right by your side
oh , so close that you couldn' t see
if love could speak , it would shout to the sky
i' ve always been here
i always will be
i' m here
i' m now
i' m now
open your eyes and see me
right here
right now
open your eyes to love
open your mind to love
open your heart to love
ooh , ooh , ooh
