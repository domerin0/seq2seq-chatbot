i never met a brother who didn' t have faith .
i' ve stood in front of dozens of men ... who were all staring death in the face .
every single one of them begged for god' s help .
after seeing all those pleas go unanswered ,
i ... lost my faith .
so what' s the what ?
my answer ... is this .
no .
i guess we' re done here .

why don' t we talk about the real reason ... <i>that you would come down here on new year' s eve ... </ i> in the middle of this storm .
okay .
uh , let' s see .
we had an appointment .
i think the real reason ... is you' re in love with me .
huh .
interesting .
i can see it in your eyes .
that' s why you come wearing these fancy clothes .

how do i feel about it ?
it' s no big change .
so i guess the new year' s not bringing anything different for you .
how' s your leg , by the way ?
i noticed you weren' t limping anymore .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
it' s just an observation .
five years of undercover work , and now this .

so how did you enjoy your file ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
you dropped this .

that' s strange , because i was sure that you took it .
definitely dropped it .
that' s disappointing .
<i>if you had stolen it , it would' ve been the first time ... </ i> you were taking a proactive interest in your therapy .

jake roenick no longer considers himself a cop .
<i>what kind of bullshit is that ?
huh ? </ i>
you think i' m scared ?
that' s what it is , right ?
if you' d read further on , you would see that' s not what i think .

it' s very unprofessional .
don' t try to discredit me because you' re afraid i may be right .
<i>right ?
yes . </ i>
about what ?
come on .
tell me what it is you think i' m hiding from , and then i' il tell you whether i think you' re right .
okay !
i believe that the prospect of responsibility has rendered you impotent !
impotent ?
yes !
and that' s why you' re working at this old precinct behind a desk .
i' m injured , all right ?
that' s why i' m here .
bullshit !
you feel responsible for the death of your team eight months ago , and that' s why you' re here .
i didn' t do anything wrong .
a board of inquiry cleared me .
that' s right .
you didn' t do anything wrong .
<i>but it was your decision that sent them down the left hallway ... </ i> and not the right , out the front door and not the back .
and you don' t want to make decisions like that again .
yeah .
so ?
maybe you' re right .
what ?
you want a medal ?
so now you' re hiding behind that desk .
and behind that liquor in your drawer ... and those ... pills in that stupid little matchbox .
but there' s still one life you' re responsible for , no matter where you go .
oh , let me guess .
my own ?
yeah , your own .

<i>i don' t know where the fuck the are !
everything' s been packed !
roenick ! </ i>
get down !
get down !
jasper , get the blinds !
all right .
all right .
yeah , we' re perfectly safe now .
these are just scare tactics , all right ?
they don' t know how much firepower we have or don' t have .
<i>they' re not gonna come in here again .
it' s too risky . </ i>
what about us gettin ' out there , sergeant ?
i i need help real bad .
i need it .
let' s barricade up these doors and windows , and i' il figure out how to get some help in here .
what are you doing this for , jake ?
nobody gives a shit anymore about anything .
we can end this right now .
i can' t let a murderer walk out of here .
i can' t do that .
i' il get us out of this , jasper .
i will .
i promise .
you got almost no chance out there , buddy .
that cop in there dies if i don' t try .
you keep the place locked down until i get some help .
all right .
i' d better cover from the front windows .
i can see the truck better from there .
keep your head down .
schmuck .
oh , shit !
<i>oh , shit ! </ i>
i found this on our friend out there .
fuck it .
fact or fiction ?
you pulled a guy' s spine out once , didn' t you ?
<i>are you a surgeon ? </ i>
<i>i heard that bullet you took in your belly is still lodged in there , rattling around . </ i>
<i>i bet you it' s causing you a lot of intestinal issues .
right ?
right , man ? </ i>
<i>bishop , i need to talk to you . </ i>
so i just killed a man .
his name was danny barbero .
a cop .
a cop who works for ray portnow .
the man you killed .
<i>so tell me why cops are risking their lives to get to you , bishop . </ i>
why should i answer that question ?
because i' m thinking about sending you out to the wolves and saving my own ass if you don' t .
i assume you know who i am , sergeant .
you' re a scumbag gangster .
and one of my scumbag partners in crime is your fellow officer , marcus duvall .
<i>marcus duvall and his entire team . </ i>
we used to split things 50 50 .
marcus got greedy .
he wanted more .
so you killed ray portnow .
after he tried to kill me .
mm .
right .
<i>they' re here to execute me , because if i make it to court, </ i> every single one of them goes to jail for the rest of their days .
how many cops are involved in this ?
i can' t say exactly , but the blood money runs through your entire department .
i bet they' re all here now , and they can' t allow me to leave this precinct alive .
they can' t allow any of us to leave here alive .
now that we all know it' s them out there .
sarge .
<i>poor guy , he never had a chance .
anyone know if he had any family ? </ i>
<i>someone' s coming !
shit , someone' s coming ! </ i>
someone' s coming .
hit squad , sergeant .
they' re here for all of us .
me ?
all of us .
you especially .
<i>fuck you , dealer .
this is all your fault . </ i>
<i>those are your brethren out there , old man , not mine . </ i>
don' t compare me with your scumbag friends out there .
if it was up to me , i' d kick your ass out the door .
i' d like to see you come try .
yeah , sure .
you' d love to kill another cop today , wouldn' t you ?
only you .
<i>they' il be coming on strong now . </ i>
why ?
why are cops coming to kill us ?
they need to kill him before he fingers them in court .
they need to kill us too , now that we know it' s them .
so ... here' s what we' re gonna do .
we' re gonna take positions all around the precinct , and we' re gonna hold ' em off until dawn .
iris , alex , you know how to use a firearm ?
no .
no .
why don' t you give me one of them guns , sergeant .
i' il help you fend off the black hats .
oh .
oh , shit .
men are here .
good .
what a fuckin ' mess this is .
i know .
i' m lookin ' at this as a matter of simple mathematics .
if we walk and those eight people survive , then 33 lives are destroyed .
the lives of my men and their families .
people i' m responsible for .
people i ...
people i love .
i don' t see any other way , marcus .
the blood trail leads right back to us .
we have no choice .
if we go through this , we are gonna have to live with this for the rest of our lives .
but you know something , mike ?
i could live with that more than i could live with a cell mate .
<i>once we step outside, </ i> those people are no longer civilians or cops .
we gotta put ' em all down .
without pause , without regard .

i hide behind its structure .
you' re gonna be all right , doc .
we don' t know that .
don' t know that .
you' re so calm .
thank you so much .
thanks .
you don' t have to do this .
yes , i do .
i do .
if i' m gonna die , at least i should die gracefully .
how are you keeping it together ?
i just think about living .
i want to live , as opposed to i don' t want to die .
that , and i keep telling myself everybody' s gonna make it this time .
we both know what could happen here , sergeant .
safety off .
yeah .

the problem is outside , not inside .

<i>no , no .
you know what the problem is ?
that we criminals got rights , baby . </ i>
that' s right .
we got rights to be protected against assault under any circumstances .
if you can' t provide that , well , fuck you ... we will .
you' re a fuckin ' psycho .
jesus christ , jake !
what ?

huh ?
the first chance they get to blow our brains out , they' il try to make a break for it .
<i>they need us as much as we need them . </ i>
we all gotta start trusting each other right now if we' re gonna make it through this night .
put the gun down , jasper .
put the goddamn gun down !
what ?
<i> shit .
all right .
all right . </ i>
now , let' s all introduce ourselves to each other .
it' s new year' s eve .
let' s turn over a new leaf .
all right .
let' s not all fuckin ' speak at once .
the name' s smiley .
i' m a libra , and ...
i' il handle these jokers .
you handle your people , maybe we get out of here tonight .
he armed his prisoners .
it' s a smart play .
must be at least eight guns in there now .
just a couple hours till the sun' s up .
if we can' t breach , what do we do ?
get the a. v. 5 here .
are you sure about that ?
yep .
i' m not takin ' any more chances .
it' s gonna take a while in this weather .
marcus ?
what the fuck do we do if it doesn' t arrive in time ?
we' il have to think of some other way of ending this .
you either flirting with me or clocking my game ' cause you don' t trust me .
i don' t like your beady little eyes all over my goodies , so turn the fuck away .
you' re manipulative , weak knees and that sexy copper complexion .
you' re definitely an aries , baby .
you' re pretty good .
smiley thanks you .
<i>we got something in common , you know that ? </ i>
you comin ' down off some shit , ain' t ya ?
don' t be ashamed , man .
don' t be ashamed .
what' s your poison ?
seconal to bring me down .
adderall to bring me back up .
you gotta get up to get down .
oh , yeah , baby .
oh , yeah .
all right .
that' s enough .
come on .
let' s pay attention .
i want a cigarette so bad .
stupid new year' s resolutions .
hey , gangster , you make any resolutions ?
hmm ?
what do you think , secretary ?
oh , my god .
i can' t stop thinking about sex .
<i>i mean , i usually think about sex a lot , but this is crazy . </ i>
<i>sex and death are very closely related . </ i>
the greeks called it eros and thanatos ... love and death .
<i>or sex as a way of nullifying thoughts of dying . </ i>
what' s your deal , gangster ?
you actually been shot five times ?
six .
you really pull a man' s spine out ?
it was an adam' s apple .
if you ever get into tussles , secretary , you grab a man by his throat , hmm ?
dig it ?
and then you squeeze .
i guarantee you he will drop .
he will not get up for quite some time .
oh , god .
it' s really quiet out there now .
yeah .
that' s what worries me .
<i>we' re not gonna make it till morning .
marcus duvall will not allow it . </ i>
we' ve got eight people covering six entry points .
if we work together , we will make it .
look at it this way .
that' s me out there .
you think i' d let you survive until the morning ?
we don' t have a lot of options here .
well , we got to figure something ,
' cause i' m not gonna stay here all night waitin ' to get killed .
if you use the situation to try and escape , it' s about me and you ,
' cause when this is over , you' re goin ' back to jail .
relax , sergeant .
" relax .
this ain' t about me and you .
not yet .
our shit' s on pause , huh ?
yeah .
our shit' s on pause .
you saved my ass back there .
why ?
everyone in here is my responsibility .
it' s my job .
that' s noble .
unfortunately , i don' t share the sentiment .
i see a cop in jeopardy , he' s on his own , unless it benefits me to jump in for the save .
<i>listen .
i don' t try to be anything i' m not . </ i>
that ain' t gonna change ; i don' t care what day it is .
<i>you remember that , sergeant . </ i>
<i>hey !
someone' s comin ' . </ i>
oh , god .
it' s capra , sarge !
<i>you know this guy ?
he' s a cop .
he works here . </ i>
they' il execute him .
capra !
shh !
yeah .
drive .
drive !
<i>oh , my god .
he' s gonna make it .
he still has to get by the sniper . </ i>
<i>come on , capra ! </ i>
he' s still moving .
they didn' t get him yet .
<i>where are you going ? </ i>
come on .
come on .
<i>come on , capra !
come on ! </ i>
come on !
what the fuck is goin ' on ?
who' s fuckin ' shootin ' at us , sarge ?
who the fuck are all these people ?
<i>what are you doin ' here , capra ?
what are you doin ' here ? </ i>
it' s new year' s eve .
i knew you' d be here alone .
i came to have a drink with iris .
you picked the wrong night to make your move , baby , believe me .
you know , that' s really sweet .
that' s really sweet , but , unfortunately , i don' t believe a fuckin ' word of it .
put that goddamn weapon down , you psycho !
he works here !
i don' t care that he fuckin ' works here , man .
he could be a plant .
<i>no , jasper .
put the gun down , all right ?
let' s not start that again , all right ? </ i>
<i>he comes here in the guise of courting that lady .
it' s a fuckin ' ingenious plan . </ i>
they get one of their boys in here and then take us out one by one by one .
come on .
tell ' em .
they shot at him .
all right ?
they shot at him .
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah .
oh , but they conveniently fuckin ' missed , didn' t they ?
the act is a fuckin ' charade !
<i>come on .
tell ' em .
he' s fuckin ' right , anna . </ i>
<i>isn' t it a fucking charade ?
do i have a gun ? </ i>
<i>do i have a fucking gun ?
i can' t hurt you . </ i>
it' s not fuckin ' good enough , rat bitch .
come on .
just lock him up , man , so he doesn' t do any damage .
<i>come on .
come on , roenick .
listen to me , man .
we' re not lockin ' this man up . </ i>
not in my precinct , all right ?
i vouch for him .
okay .
okay , i' m fuckin ' sorry , but your authority has been super fuckin ' seded .
<i>you understand ?
you' re not in charge anymore . </ i>
right , bish ?
bish , tell ' em .
<i>he could be one of them , man , so fuckin ' easily . </ i>
<i>you don' t think we see right through you ?
fuckin ' believe that shit ? </ i>
<i>comes in here playing that game , playing stupid .
you don' t think we know ? </ i>
right , man ?
let' s do the math .
let' s put him away , man , just play it safe , you know ?
put it down .
no , no , no .
come on .
come on , man .
come on .
just do the math .
come on .
motherfucker comes in like that , playing ...
come here .
sergeant roenick is in charge .
understand ?
yes .
let' s go .
only because i respect you .
but i still say this shit is fuckin ' illogical bullshit , all right ?
he may not be who he says he is .
just mull that shit over .
think it over .
think it over , man .
iris , look after capra , fill him in on what' s goin ' on .
all right , capra ?
just be cool so no one else here gets spooked .
everybody else , back to your positions .
thank you .
don' t .
that was self preservation .
the more men we have , the better chance we stand .
are you sure you vouch for this man ?
i do .
come with me .
you know , i hate to admit it , but smiley agrees with what you said back there .
smiley want a fuckin ' medal ?
hear me out , man .

what do you want ?
listen to me , man .
look out that window .
that' s freedom , baby .
<i>get what i' m sayin ' ? </ i>
look , maybe this new year' s can bring something different for us after all .

problem with drugs and alcohol since the incident .
burned out cop .
only a matter of time before he drops his guard .
watch the truck .
they' il eye it as a way out .
what' s the word on the a. v. ?
storm' s starting to let up , so it shouldn' t be long now .
good .
someone gets inside , takes off , goes for help .
it' s too obvious .
we' d need a distraction .
we also need the keys .
your cop said he dropped ' em in the snow .
<i> i could hot wire a car .
i thought you never committed a crime in your life ? </ i>
i haven' t .
yeah .
<i>just picked up some shit along the way .
whoa .
