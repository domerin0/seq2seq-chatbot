one conveyor dead , one mangled , 150, 000 euros gone .
witnesses ?
only empty offices .
same guns , same o4 explosives , same planning .
it' s them again .
look around .
you won' t find much , but go ahead .
the headless man says hi !
blown away by a mercury bullet .
eve verhagen , oou .
eddy valence , brl .
yeah , i can read .
where do you hail from ?
suburban narcotics squad .
sick of smashing syringes ?
you could say that .
klein is sulking , stay with him .
don' t chat with the enemy .
we' re enemies ?
brl/ oou , it' s an old rivalry .
aren' t we a big family ?
so they say .
she' s private property .
klein' s ?
who else ?
how could you be pals with him ?
he wasn' t always like this .
their names ?
winterstein .
bruno and rolf .
the one who did me was bruno .
your big mouth will get you in trouble .
now it has .
7 vans in 18 months 9 conveyors slaughtered , and a 2 million euro booty .
the ministry of the lnterior sent us a memo .
asking us , and i quote : " to tackle the problem head on
and neutralize the criminals
who' ve derided our forces for too long .
too long " is bad !
means we' ve been around for too long , doing nothing !
as of today you' re on duty 24 hours a day !
drop your personal problems , don' t laze on sundays , go out and nab that gang of fuckers before they strike for the 8th time !
you got that ?
got that ,
oapt .
kechichian ?
we were up late .
for a good cause .
sure , loitering in a bar at 2 am , after defacing the wall of a government building , how can i fault you for being so admirable !
anything else ?
a lead on the van jobs .
victor dragan .
we got a tip off from an informant .
a reliable source ?
not at all .
what do you say ?
i know the fellow .
a sadistic loner .
barring a lucky break , he' il be tough to nail .
luck can be engineered .
briefing' s over !
vrinks , you stay .
i' ve been appointed police oommissioner .
as of when ?
l take over on sept 1 .
oongratulations .
i hate to leave before i' ve cleaned house .
i want that gang , leo .
as my farewell gift .
you' il get them .
another thing : someone will get my desk .
you' re the right man .
klein wants to be ohief .
he wants power , that' s different .
but you both qualify : same rank , seniority , service rating .
so whoever nails that scum , will be king .
i don' t mix with brass .
it' s better than mixing with whores and hoods .
times have changed .
get yourself a new style .
you' re an anomaly .
your men , your methods .
ln the police , now you toe the line , you snap to .
lf you don' t , no one will cover for you .
all the brass have caved in .
even you ?
lay off me , shit !
who the fuck are you ?
shit , what ya doin ' ?
who the fuck are you ?
what have i done ?
don' t do that , don' t !
lay off manou , or i' il stuff you with your brother' s head .
quite a shiv !
war booty .
oreep' s gotta hitchhike buck naked , and cuffed !
we shoulda wasted him !
gotta be ten grand !
a year' s pay for a flatfoot .
those fuckers !
for our slush fund ?
no , it' s for manou .
leo .
oome in .
hi , ohristo .
manou' s resting in her room .
i' il tell her you' re here .
let her rest .
she ok ?
just ok .
still after that van gang ?
still am .
i hear they hit again .
near the beltway , right ?
my only advice is : when you bust ' em , shoot first !
you know anything ?
i' m not a snitch .
ask your questions elsewhere .
who worked over manou ?
what do you mean ?
leo ...
l' m 46 , i spent 18 years in jail .
she' s the best thing that happened to me .
someone hurt her , i gotta know .
lf i tell you , what' il you do ?
that' s up to me .
you' re in trouble any time you step out of here !
you' re a hood , ohristo .
with a record for armed robbery .
lf you smack your neighbor over a trifle , you go back to jail !
manou needs you : if you go down , so does she .
screw your cop morality .
anyway , it' s settled .
i dealt with it .
this is to make amends .
around 7 grand .
i' il see you out .
thanks , leo .
i won' t forget .
the guy you' re looking for , dragan .
i know where he is .
at a chick' s place on borrego st.
don' t ask how i know .
police !
freeze !
stay there !
get up !
let me hug my kid .
your wrists !
sign there .
have a nice leave , silien .

with a 2nd clip , just in case .
this is dumb , silien .
you got 3 weeks to do .
watch the road .
neat vodka .
you kept dragan to yourself .
was that wrong ?
don' t they say , it takes two to tango ?
we' re not dancing anymore .
anyway , he was a bum lead .
how do you know ?
i know .
that' s all .
silien here .
how are you , captain ?
am i intruding ?
sure , it' s after midnight .
where are you ?

oamille ok ?
she' s fine .
when did you buy this ?
we' il talk cars later .
what' s up ?
nice welcome !
you haven' t seen me in 4 years .
don' t i rate a smile ?
this is a favor for a pal inside .
you made me cross paris for a lousy scam ?
i got a hot tip .
you' re a piece of shit .
what is it ?
heavy duty stuff .
real hot tip .

i know who the van gang are .
and their next stunt .
they' re in the sticks .
it starts from there .
ln exchange , you cover me .
or get nailed with me .
who did you waste ?
marcus zerbib , his driver and his goon .
marcus zerbib ?
the guy who put you in jail ?
you' il get nabbed right away !
not with a good alibi .
now ... you can grab the worst gang around .
ohoose .
ok , let' s have it .
francis horn and robert boulanger .
they' re squatting in st ouen .
on oaptain glarner st.
don' t you say hi ?
i hadn' t seen you .
want a drink ?
i' m with friends .
you got friends now ?
your only friend is me .
lf i conk out , you' re dead .
here' s my direct line , so you can' t forget it .
give me a lead , fast .
that gang ...
i want their names first .
nobody knows them , i swear !
i want news from you .
stay in touch .
so i know you' re ok .
good seeing you again .
how' d you get that ?
it' s nothing .
at work .
why not tell me what you do ?
i don' t want to lose you .
you get home late , leave early .
lots of cops live that way .
many wind up all alone .
what are you after ?
nothing .
i just do my job .
get up , lazybones !
morning , dad " .
morning , dad .
and give him a kiss .
no school today ?
never on wednesday .
you know that .
yeah , if i knew it' s wednesday .
mom in ?
rushing as usual .
thanks for the ... coffee !
my ass is spreading , that' s bad .
i don' t mind , i love big asses .
know what my big ass says to you ?
that it misses me .
sunday' s my dad' s 70th birthday .
he hopes we' il come .
there' il be a crowd .
you don' t have to talk .
what crowd ?
my mom' s family .
uncles , aunts , cousins coming from rome .
we' il see .
lola , hurry !
bye , daddy o .
bye , honey .
6 slugs were fired .
2 hit the driver , 1 the goon , 3 zerbib .
no one saw much .
the building' s all oldies .
by the time they shuffled to a window , it was all over .
but the concierge saw a girl get out of the merc and run away .
brunette , red coat , a bj artist .
zerbib liked cheap whores .
we' il find her .
that' s for homicide , not us .
you knew him well ?
enough to want to nab his killer .
vrinks , brl .
the names horn and boulanger .
give me all you' ve got .
what' s with the zerbib case ?
he was getting a bj in the car .
had his dong out and his pants down .
a concierge saw the girl leave after the shooting .
she see anything else ?
ask homicide , it' s their baby .
oan i see the telex ?
boulanger .
i got several , which do you want ?
robert .
francis horn and robert boulanger , aka bob .
horn : armed robbery record .
wanted for theft , armed robbery , extortion and attempted murder .
weapons freak , ex mercenary , trained in syria , a real psycho .
boulanger broke from jail 2 years ago , killing a guard and an officer .
seems horn sprung boulanger to have him on his team .
i have no other names , but they operate from here , a squat beside a warehouse by the beltway .
first , we find lookouts and set up surveillance teams .
smao and titi will be in the silo overlooking the squat .
you photograph everyone coming and going .
you identify all vehicles , and any lowlifes in the area .
second , we cordon off the area , block escape routes , one team per street in a perimeter of half a mile within the area .
third , we advise the local police we' il be playing on their turf for a few days , and to lie low on the day we make the grab .
no neighborhood investigations or questioning , we avoid concierges , storekeepers , local hangouts .
klein , oou .
you don' t know me , i know you .
no waves : we settle in , watch and wait .
know what they' il hit ?
no .
we can' t lose them .
let' s go .
wear bulletproof vests over your t shirts .
we have a common friend , a friend who just died .
marcus zerbib , you know him ?
he wasn' t a friend .
you two were in business .
some nasty gossips say he snitched on you 4 years ago .
the guys he snitched on would fill the phone book .
but only you could gun him down in cold blood , during a leave from jail .
would i waste him when i have 2 weeks left to do ?
what' s wrong , leo ?
nothing , why ?
don' t kid me .
you' re lost , i can tell .
i' m in deep shit , and i can' t discuss it .
not even with me ?
not even with you .
where were you that night ?
with a cop .
hq' s finest cop .
we met at " swann' s " at 1 am , we chewed the fat till 5 am , then he dropped me at my hotel .
ok ?
his name ?
vrinks .
i' il need your boys .
what for ?
we located the van gang .
how' d you get the tip ?
know a man called silien ?
why ?
says he was with you when zerbib died .
lf he says so , must be true .
oould i have that in writing ?
lnvestigating murders now ?
when my snitches get killed .
those fuckers give me a giant hard on .
some get laid , others freeze !
we' re on the wrong team .
no , that' s his last fuck .
we' il hump again .
you sure ?
big luc to fat ass .
mercedes wagon , local plates , 4 men on board .
lt' s headed your way .
long haired guy is frank ohenaf .
l nabbed him for a holdup 10 years ago .
a mean fucker .
i don' t know the others .
sad and jamel attia .
i say it' s for tomorrow .
nabbing ' em in the act' s dumb .
they' il fire at us .
we may lose them to avoid bloodshed .
what do you suggest ?
we hit ' em at night , and gun down the lot of them .
what about our ethics code ?
i' ve wiped my ass with that for years .
they killed 9 men .
9 families call me every week hoping i' il have good news at last .
i owe it to them .
it obsesses me .
stay home , let vrinks deal with it .
i' ve worked 2 years on this case .
it' s my collar as much as anyone' s .
ok , but you' il be back up .
you only move in on vrinks' s orders .
he and his men are the front line .
he' s in charge of this .
whether you like it or not .
lgor here , they' re coming out .
headed for the cars .
gotcha .
big luc here , they' re coming out .
two black suv' s and a mercedes .
standby .
i' il advise when they move .
seurat ohenaf in the lead car , the attia brothers in the second .
and the rest ?
i only see boulanger .
the suv' s are off .
they' re taking off .
the suv' s are leaving .
very slowly .
i see them .
they just passed us .
let ' em leave the area .
guy and bernie tail the suv' s .
we tail horn , boulanger , the chick .
we only hit ' em at the warehouse .
l repeat . don' t hit ' em here !
the suv' s are stopped at the entrance .
horn and the chick are out .
we' il be ok .
armed to the teeth .
where' s he going ?
eve to dennis .
what' s up ?
what are the orders ?
they' re about to leave .
shit , someone' s moving !
klein' s headed for the squat .
he' s alone .
what' s he up to ?
he' s drawn his gun , headed for them .
dennis to leo .
what is this ?
what is this ?
answer !
oops , behind you .
move in at once !
i said : move in now !
shit , big luc !
they hit me !
grenade !
oome on , bitch !
drop your guns !
drop your gun , pig !
drop your guns , hands on your heads !
hands on your head !
oome along , bitch !
let go of her !
fuck you !
shut up !
drop your gun !
drop your gun .
i' il waste her !
on your knees !
kneel !
that' s better !
hands behind your head , scumbag !
lf you tail me , i' il waste the bitch !
don' t take her , take me .
you' re dead !
stay put !
state police found eve lying on the freeway .
she jumped out of the moving car .
fucker' s got some nerve !
big luc , smao ...
what does this mean ?
the oommissioner didn' t like you and your men' s stunt at the funeral .
screw him !
i know .
but i' m warning you .
of what ?
top brass are like old maids : you don' t ream them .
get your men back in line , drop the petitions , the strike threats , the defaming of klein .
klein goofed , he has to be punished .
that' s for lnternal affairs , not you .
an investigation' s under way .
lf klein was responsible for this fuck up , it' il come out .
taking on klein is taking on the hierarchy , which is questioning the system .
you can' t do that .
so eddy died in vain ?
he died doing his duty .
sorry .
i owe him the truth .
what' s that ?
requests for transfers .
we all signed .
it' s klein or us , you decide .
lt' s dennis .
i hear you' re testifying against me at the inquiry .
valence' s death was fate , pal .
stirring up shit won' t bring him back .
you agree ?
i' m gonna hang up .
you can' t do this to me .
you can' t .
this job , is all i have .
so don' t crap on me , or you' il regret it !
where is he ?
room 24 , 2nd floor .
and the witness ?
he split .
he' s married and was with a chick , didn' t want any heat .
pulling strings is an insult to valence .
i can' t , dennis .
some deaths you can' t touch .
are you refusing ?
no .
as i said , this isn' t any old file .
he was a fine cop , the union backs vrinks .
unless we humor them , police hq will be up in arms .
all i can do is try to convince the board not to suspend you .
with your record , it should work .
and if it doesn' t ?
police !
freeze !
know why i didn' t kill you , horn ?
death only happens once .
i won' t let it surprise you .
you' il wait for it in a cell , like an idiot , until you go nuts from loneliness .
know what ?
one day i' il be behind your door !
i' il kill you and your whole family .
i doubt it .
oan i see you a minute ?
boulanger' s dead .
a freeway roadblock .
he tried to run it .
gift from the oommissioner .
with a letter of congratulations .
to be shared among you .
200 euros .
doesn' t cover eddy' s wreath .
klein' s in front of the board in 2 days .
i know .
let the system handle it .
lf you mess things up , they' il make you pay for it .
where do you stand ?
me ...
i' ve already left .
evening , oaptain .
i hear things are edgy at hq .
it' s a problem for cops .
not for you .
that why you wanted to see me ?
no , for my girlfriend .
she got busted .
they claim she' s hooking and gave it to the aliens office .
she may be expelled and fined .
what do i care ?
the zerbib affair interest you ?
go on .
he died in her mouth .
fix her case , you never heard of me , she' il tell all .
i' m listening .
there were two men .
one fired , the other waited in the car .
l saw the one in the car today .
where did you see him ?
at police hq .
he' s a cop .
what do you want ?
lssued by judge rousseau , instructions to search your home and take you in for questioning .
you crazy ?
you' d better let us in .
go fuck yourself !
you got fucked , vrinks .
search the whole place .
leo , what' s happening ?
who is this ?
it' s nothing .
stay with lola .
who' s lola ?
my daughter .
who are you ?
lnternal affairs .
don' t worry .
why are they arresting you ?
later , oamille .
do what i said .
oamille called .
what did she want ?
what do you think ?
was leo' s arrest your doing ?
it wasn' t my doing .
he was arrested for being dumb .
i did my job .
yourjob is jailing your friends ?
when they cross the line , yes .
you won' t fulfill yourself that way .
meaning ?
becoming the fine cop you' il never be .
why didn' t you tell me ?
what for ?
we nailed horn and his gang .
the rest is a detail .
lt could jail you for 10 years .
you covered up a murder .
you don' t realize .
no .
i got screwed by my informant , not the same .
i owed him for his tip .
you' d have done the same .
i' m not you .
what should i do ?
oome clean : don' t crap lnternal affairs .
the hooker recognized you and silien .
denial makes you an accomplice .
i gotta snitch on silien ?
he put you in deep shit .
tell us where he is .
it' s your only chance .
i don' t know where he is .
judge rousseau has been assigned to the case .
you know him .
he hates cops , he' il slaughter you .
... olosing a blind eye on 3 murders to protect an informant and arrest a vicious gang is one thing .
that this led to a colleague' s death , and the events that ensued , is another .
what is serious , vrinks , is that your silence meant silien was freed .
he' s a menace to society .
i won' t dwell on the ethics of policemen and informants .
we both know it' s open to personal interpretation , and rests on fuzzy rules and controls .
never to guarantee impunity to an informant , or take the place ofjustice , whatever the goals .
see you soon , boss !
that' s why i' m ordering your incarceration .
dennis klein , badge number 628049 .
you appeared before this board to answer on your responsibility in the death of lt. eddy valence during a police operation on glarner st , in st ouen , last january 12th .
seeing the findings of the lnternal affairs division , by ohief lnspector staneck , and the statement by lt. jenner confirming that you acted in self defense , as the man francis horn had
spontaneously opened fire ,
while you were on a reconnaissance mission .
seeing that oapt .
vrinks' s statement was held to be inadmissible due to his present situation , and his closeness to the victim , this board clears you of all responsibility in this tragic matter .
hence , all charges are dropped , nothing will appear in your file .
among criminals , guys like you end up on a vacant lot , with 3 slugs in their head .
among criminals , guys like me don' t listen to guys like you .
when' il dad be back ?
soon .
but he hasn' t left us ?
why do you say that ?
because you' re sad .
usually when he' s away , you' re not sad .
usually , he doesn' t go so far away .
your honor ,
i' m oaptain vrinks' s wife .
my husband has been jailed for almost 3 weeks .
i' m still not allowed to see him .
my little girl asks for news of her dad every night .
why do this ?
you could issue me a visiting permit now .
i have a lunch date .
excuse me .
who is this ?
i want to help you .
help me do what ?
i can' t say on the phone .
oan we meet ?
l' il call later .
l can' t say on the phone .
it' s him .
l' il call later .
it' s his voice .
tap her phone day and night .
don' t miss his call .
when you' ve zeroed in on silien , advise me .
only me !
hello , oamille .
got time for a coffee ?
what do you want ?
to say i' m sorry for what happened .
i didn' t want this .
lf you need anything ...
i don' t need you , dennis .
i haven' t for ages .
ls that all ?
no ...
that won' t be necessary .
one question , mr vrinks : the same one .
where' s your friend hugo silien ?
my answer hasn' t changed .
you can take him back .
why treat me this way ?
it' s how i treat people here .
i' m not like them .
i' m a cop .
you' re nothing now .
handcuffs !
don' t move !
the other one .
don' t worsen things .
ouff yourselves to the radiator !
fast !
don' t move , asshole !
hurry !
why did you do it ?
to see you .
now what' il they do ?
put me in the corner , till it blows over .
then i' il be let back in .
when ?
soon .
hold out !
lf you can outside , i can inside .
they can' t keep me for long .
why didn' t you tell me ?
so they couldn' t question you .
how' s lola ?
she misses you .
what did you tell her ?
the truth .
dennis came to see me at work .
what for ?
he wanted to know if i knew a man called silien .
what did you say ?
nothing .
i said nothing .
has he tried to reach you ?
who ?
silien .
has he ?
answer , oamille .
no one called .
stay away , he' s bad news .
you promise ?
i promise .
i love you .
i love you , too .
kiss lola .
we can go now .
let me welcome here our new police ohief , mr robert mancini .
and introduce you to the man who succeeds him as the new head of the old .
oaptain dennis klein .
let' s wish them both good luck .
to the new head !
what are you after ?
nothing ...
i came to watch you , to learn .
thinking of him ?
should l ?
i thought cops were special , above bad things .
why should we be ?
give me a good reason .
we' re paid to be better .
my respects , ohief .
throw the fucker out !
put him in the drunk tank .
let go !
i know the way out !
he' il resign once he' s sober !
under me , you' d better lose your bad habits !
this is captain klein' s number .
leave a message after the beep .
boss , it' s jenner .
are you in ?
we tapped silien calling her again .
they' re meeting at ...
i' m listening .
subject got in .
they' re on rte 20 , freeway bound .
zebra 4 stay put , let them come to you .
3 and 5 stay behind .
we' il nab ' em by the freeway .
think of her , it' s risky .
drive .
there' s 20 grand for you .
you and your daughter .
until leo' s out .
i should say thanks .
my letter explains things .
i can' t do more .
lf they nab me , i' il get life .
how long' s leo in for ?
those are the rules .
he took a gamble and lost .
damn that .
what can you do for him ?
nothing .
what' s this ?
you snitched !
turn !
stop !
they' re headed for you now .
don' t let her by !
i must !
don' t let her by !
dammit !
i hear you want a transfer .
too bad .
i' d put up your name for promotion to oaptain .
like the others ?
they saw it was a smart move .
i' m not made for your clan .
i' m a plain cop , no dumber than others .
i' m fine as i am .
then why didn' t you speak up ?
vrinks jailed , his wife dead , you as boss , suits ' em all .
why should i blab ?
one day the ghosts will come and take you away .
you' il have to answer for your dirty tricks .
some day , we all have to die ...
we have to go .
sorry .
i want to kiss my daughter .
not cuffed .
i can' t .
it' s the rule .
i' il handle it .
no one knows why silien shot her .
bye , darling .
i' il be back soon .
wait for me .
you going back to jail ?
yes , i' il write you every day .
don' t leave me alone , dad .
i' m not .
granpa' s there .
i love you , darling .
i love you , too .
captain vrinks released from jail ...
