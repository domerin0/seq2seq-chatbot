theresa , a man is never excited about meeting his future father in law .

i know .
but i' m thinking now that maybe it was a bad idea .
no , i think it' s a great idea .
announcing our engagement at my parents ' party ... is gonna be the best present we can give them .
babe , mom' s gonna flip .

yeah .
we' re bringing in a canopy here .
swags of tulle with festoons .
sprays of roses .
parquet dance floor here .
guests will be seated at tables in chiavari chairs .
very clean , very simple , very elegant .
and rose petals on the lawn .
and not just a few ... oodles .
at my wedding , we had oodles of petals .

i' m digging that one , baby .
really ?
well , that' s too bad , ' cause i' m wearing this one .
hallelujah .
sweetheart .
yeah ?
listen .
why do you even bother asking me ?
' cause it' s a big day for us and i wanted you to feel included .
why couldn' t you include martha superfreak out there ?
dante is a nice man .
a nice man .
a nice man that part of the time likes to sleep with other nice men .
will you stop it ?
would you open your mind , percy jones ?
dante is a metrosexual .
a what ?
he' s a straight man with taste .
no such thing .
you might as well tell me he rode over here on a unicorn .
look , serious face , serious moment .
i need to talk to you .
i know , baby .
i' m working on my vows .
almost got them perfect .
that' s sweet , but that' s not it .
what is it ?
this boy that theresa' s bringing home ?
i don' t know who his people are , where he' s from ...
i don' t know anything about him .
but what i do know is that i need you to be nice .
i' m always nice .
let' s be nice long enough to find out who the boy is .
i already know who he is .
you pulled his credit report ?
i did not .
you pulled his credit report , percy ?
i mean , i glanced at it .
but a credit report don' t tell you the character of a man .
but being a loan officer for 22 years ...
i can size that boy up in an instant .
and you know i got a knack for it .
you know that .
five seconds .
that' s all i need .
that' s all i need .
nobody knows that better than me .
say what ?
i didn' t stutter .
i' m not so good with dads , baby .
i' m good with moms .
i' m better with moms .
he' s a big guy , right ?
scary big .
he also has these ... piercing eyes that just burn right into your soul .
don' t maintain eye contact for a long period of time .
at least today , okay ?

i' m very sorry .
it was a bad joke .
so , did you tell them ?
no .
i only told them the important things .
that i love you .
that you' re an amazing man .
that you have a very cute birthmark on your left butt cheek .
you just didn' t feel the need to mention it' s a caucasian butt cheek .
that was ...
simon , look .
i didn' t mention it because i don' t think it' s gonna matter .
it' s gonna matter .
we' re fine , sir .
dad !
look at this here .
oh , my god .

but if you' re still down with me making your girl happy ...
i' m good to go .
why don' t you just go ?
just ...
i wish theresa would have told me you guys were black .
that would have saved an awkward moment .
kind of like this one .
yeah .
welcome home , sweetheart .

baby , let me get that .
i got it .
lemonade .
damn !

why don' t we go on inside and talk ?
come on , we going on inside with a quickness .
no use standing out here .
just come on .
that boy' s white .
nothing gets past you .
i guess it' s those 22 years as a loan officer .
you knew about this .
i didn' t know a thing , i promise you .
but i did figure it out after the second " daddy !
why she just didn' t say nothing ?
give us a warning , you know ?
we taught our girls to see only people , not color .
i know that but ...
so , what' s the problem ?
i guess the problem is she just didn' t tell us .
i' m expecting denzel washington to come walking through the door ... and i get whitey mcwhiteman instead .
hi , you guys .
hi !
i' m just showing simon the house .
you' ve a very beautiful home , mrs. jones .
why , thank you .
you can call me marilyn .

i' m just kidding .

i' m making lemonade .

so , simon , they tell me you work at j. p. oliver ?

you been there long ?
well , it' s a couple of years , i suppose .
you moving up ?
there' s been some recent movement , yes .
you a hard worker ?
you work hard ?
the hardest .
j. p. oliver has a huge ipo coming up ...
he doesn' t want to hear about this .
but he' s asking you about your work .
i know , but you go into details ...
he likes to be modest .
shut up .
anyway , they made simon their ipo ...
wait , what is it ?
point man ?
and they' re flying him to san francisco on monday .
i' m not going to see him for three days .
so , simon , what do your parents do ?
yeah .
my mother is a realtor .
mom , let me help you with that .
and she sells mini blinds and teaches dance .
damn .
how many jobs your mama got ?
she' s a single parent .
she' s always been a hard worker .
what happened to your father ?
he left when i was two and i haven' t seen much of him since .
i' m sorry to hear that .
it happens .
you play any sports ?
i played some foosball in college .
that' s the table with the soccer guys ...
i know what foosball is .
stupid joke .
it' s not a sport .
dad , stop badgering him .
i' m not badgering him .
i' m just taking an interest .
i don' t understand why you don' t play sports ?
it don' t make sense .
a man who don' t play sports isn' t a real man , as far as i' m concerned .
i used to run a little .
what ?
like track ?
i mean , you don' t look like a sprinter .
what' d you run ?
did you steeplechase ?
dad !
come on , man .
what was your race ?
cars .
cars .
nascar .
nascar !
that was the one .
i had some hopes and some dreams and ... it all ended on a hot august day on a speedway in charlotte .
it was a crash .
just ...
they said i should' ve been killed .
actually , i got out without a scratch .
i figured that was a sign .
nascar ?
mostly i just worked in the pit .
i mean , i test drove for one of the drivers some , but ...
what was his name ?
jay gordon .
you drove for jeff gordon ?
we called him jay or j. g. it was like a pet name .
a pit name , actually .
nascar ?
i believe i said i don' t like to talk about that time in my life .
nascar ?
what was i supposed to do ?
he was staring at me with those piercing eyes .
he was not .
it was like ... filled with piercing disappointment ' cause i don' t play sports ?
a man who don' t play sports isn' t really a man now , is he ?
i had to give him something !
he' s big .
he' s like ...
you said he was big , but he' s big big .
but why did you lie about nascar ?
my father loves nascar .
it' s nascar , baby .
that' s , like , the whitest sport on the planet .
not anymore , simon .
there' s , like , nascar and hockey .
hockey .
i should have went with hockey .
don' t worry .
he' il forget about it .
he' s like this with everyone .
it always takes him some time to warm up to new people .
that' s all .
what are we talking about here ?
by sunday , you' il be a part of this family .
i can tell he really likes you .
i don' t like him .
and i really don' t think the whole racial thing matters to him .
it' s not that he' s white .
it' s not ?
is this yours or mine ?
that' s mine and that' s for later .
no .
i think it' s for now .
if memory serves me right , i think it' s mine .
no , simon .
take it off !
take it off right now .
it' s perfect on me .
what are you doing ?
look at it .
red is my color .
always has been .
look at it .
my goodness !
simon , take it off .
but it fits me so perfectly .
look , you' re stretching it !
take it off right now .
it' s not ruined .
it' s nice .
you take it off .
i' m not joking .
you want some of this ?
stop it , simon .
take it off .
you take it off .
coming in .
mom !
i' m going to tell her right now .
go and tell .
what ?
he' s taking simon to a hotel !
i' m paying for it .
what' s the problem ?
can i speak to you ?
you sure can .
why are you taking him to a hotel ?
you didn' t see what they were about to do upstairs .
mom , we were just playing .
well , playtime is over .
mr. jones , i' m not a cross dresser .
just for the record .
a cross dresser ?
no .
what are you ...
it' s lingerie .
you shouldn' t even be having any .
i' m a grown woman , percy !
it is not covering up the grown parts !
what !
why does the young man have to go to a hotel ?
don' t start with me .
this is my house and my rules .
your rules ?
this house can' t handle no more testosterone .
we cannot exceed the testosterone level .
we gotta keep it like that until the girls get married .
maybe even beyond that .
and i' m not suggesting anyone get married !
why can' t he stay in the basement , in your room ?
because that' s my room !
that' s my stuff down there .
how selfish .
that doesn' t make sense .
it got mold , anyway .
could be black mold .
i wouldn' t feel comfortable putting him at risk .
do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds ?
no , it' s okay .
no , it' s not okay !
what are you talking about ?
look , this is your father' s house .
we' re gonna play it by his rules .
now , he' s obviously set a testosterone standard .
and i' m going to abide by that .
you falling for that ?
i' m going with you .
no , you' re not gonna do that .
you don' t want me to go with you ?
of course i want you to !
but what ?
you need to stay here .
hello ?
you need to stay here .
no .
i want to be with you !
we' re still here !
are you two gonna be done soon , or maybe we should have a seat ?
come on , honey .
let' s sit ...
you need to help your mom with the party arrangements .
we don' t want to stress them out , do we ?
no .
all right ?
yes .
all right .
we' re all set .
i' m glad you all decided .
come on , let' s go .
come on , get your stuff .
let' s go .
yeah .
all right .
where is he ?
girl !
oh , my god .

louie was whiter than white
danger

and the colored girls go doo do doo do doo
looks like rain .
nope .
those clouds look pretty threatening .
i live here .
i know the weather .
so , theresa tells me you' re in charge of the loan department at the bank .
that must be a rewarding job .
i' m thinking about making a switch to a smaller company .
i just think there' s less political garbage .
you think i don' t deal with political garbage ?
i got political garbage coming out my ass .
if i give a guy a loan , i' m married to him for 30 years .
if i deny him , i have to deal with him in church on sunday .
i know that feeling .
don' t try to act like our jobs are alike .
good thing it isn' t raining .
that' s not rain .
it' s sprinkling .
you might want to turn on the windshield wipers .
i will once it starts raining .
come on , you two , let' s go .
i don' t want to be late .
keisha !
coming !
why you always got to knock on my door first ?
' cause you still live here .
let' s go .
it' s raining .
i don' t wanna be late .
come on .
okay , tell me what' s it like ?
what' s what like ?
being with a white guy .
come on , keisha , what' s the sex like ?
yeah .
where' s mom ?
she' s downstairs , girl .
come on !
bring it .
okay .
you know that thing they say about the size ?
completely the opposite .
really ?
they' re huge .
and not only are their penises big , but they can sing .
when they get excited , they sing up a storm .
they know a million tunes .
they' re like big ipods .
cut it out .
stop it .
keisha , seriously , is he nice ?
yeah , and he' s cute , too .
i know .
what about mom and dad ?
mom is cool with it .
i mean , dad , he seems , you know , a little on edge , but not more than usual .
isn' t he ever ?
girls !
coming !
but can i just say , i love you so much right now because ...
why ? ... from now on , no matter what i do , if i ...
crash dad' s car , or if i ...
what' s wrong ? ... rob a bank ...
if i burn this house down ...
keisha . ... i won' t be the one who brought home the white boy !
thank you !
mom !
can i help you with your bag , sir ?
i' m okay .
i got it .
you don' t trust a working man with your bag ?
no , i just ...
it' s just one bag .
what do you think , he' il rifle through your luggage ... and steal your toothbrush and your fancy conditioner ?
no , that' s not it at all .
let me tell you something .
theresa' s grandfather was a bellman for over 60 years and he never stole nothing .
could you get my bag ?
what , he' s your slave now ?
no .
did you want me to take your bag , sir ?
i don' t know .
next , please .
okay .
hi .

and that' s jones with a " j " ?
no , jones with a " p.
i made the reservation last week .
you knew you were gonna kick me out a week ago ?
son , i knew i was gonna kick you out 24 years ago ... when the doctor announced it was a girl .
here you are .
good .
we gave your room away .
what ?
check in was at 4 : 00 .
it' s thursday night .
i' m quite sure you got another room available .
i' m sorry , we' re completely booked and so is everyone else .
there' s a shriners convention in town , actually .
may i help you with anything else , mr. pjones ?
i guess i' il have to stay at your house , then .
no , there' s a crack hotel downtown .
you' il be just fine .
come on .
next .
hi .
welcome to cranford .
i don' t know what your basement' s like ...
it' s damp .
you' d hate it .
i don' t think dampness is really an issue at this point .
you can' t think about anything but getting back in the house with my daughter .
mr. jones , i' m in your house .
i' il obey your rules .
yeah , right .
you' il obey mr. jones now ... but when you' re up at 3 : 00 in the morning ... all hot and horny , you' il obey mr. johnson .
you heard the lady .
there' s no available hotel rooms in the whole town .
i' m not gonna do anything .
i swear .
put your stuff in there .
come on .
you know , dinner' s in about 10 minutes .
i don' t know what marilyn is like about schedule , but i know theresa is ...
stay out of that storm .
all right .
you can stay in my basement .
but you remember one thing .
these eyes , they see everything .
now get in the car .
come on , let' s go .
ebony , ivory
living in perfect harmony
ivory , ebony
so , how long have you two been together ?
five months .
six months .
which one is it ?
well , see , theresa counts from the first day that we met .
and i count from the first ...
how' s the chicken here ?
it' s really good .
did i tell you two girls ... that for the first dance , your father and i are gonna do the tango ?
the tango ?
you and dad ?
you know what ?
your father and i used to dance all the time when we were younger .
sweetheart , i told you we' re not doing a tango .
we' re already saying our vows .
that' s enough .
we' re doing the tango .
sorry .
i forgot to turn it off .
know what ?
this is an important call .
i' m just gonna ...
no , you can take your call here .
sit down and take your call .
it' s a business call .
it' s boring stuff .
business is not boring .
simon , sit down and take your call .
sit down .
hello .
simon ?
yeah , this is simon .
sorry i didn' t get back to you earlier .
i hope theresa makes good money as a photographer .
someone started a rumor that you' re being investigated ... by the securities and exchange commission .
that is so nathan to do something like that .
i think it' s nathan , too ...
' cause this is the last thing he wants to see , is his best employee going to another firm .
you know me .
i' m always up for a new challenge .
are you listening to me ?
you' ve been blackballed .
great !
guy , it' s not my fault .
i' m just telling you what they told me .
i' il call you next week .
did nathan put you up for another award ?
nothing .
it' s embarrassing .
hello .
can i start you off with some drinks ?
vodka tonic .
celebrating a great phone call .
okay .
bring him his liquor , and bring the rest of us our usual .
they have iced tea and i have my lemonade .
actually , i think i' m gonna have a glass of pinot grigio .
and i' il have a cosmo .
me , too .
okay .
bring them their alcohol and i' il have my usual lemonade .
someone has to act responsibly around here .
so , simon , i hear that you' re a singer .
what are you , a soprano , an alto , or ...
no ?
maybe bass ?
i don' t really sing .
how long can you hold a note ?
he can hold a note .
really ?
for a very long time .
sing something for me , baby .
are you okay ?
drink some water .
jerry , nathan' s got my ankles to my earlobes right now .
i' m gonna need ...
i' m gonna need some cash .
call me back as soon as you get this .
i need a favor , okay ?
you' ve got to be kidding me .
let me see your sexy body go ...
i knew you' d be down here sooner or later .
did you bring some of that sexy lingerie for me to try ?
what is wrong with you , boy ?
don' t you have your own underwear ?
you like my space ?
yeah .
it' s very homey .
interesting odor .
i told you it had mold .
did you come down here for this ?
having a little trouble writing your vows ?
that' s none of your damn business .
i' m just saying , i could maybe help you come up with something romantic .
don' t start thinking that you know more about romance than i do .
with your hand holding and feeding each other food ... and wiping off each other' s faces .
that' s bullshit .
being married 25 years , that' s real romance .
and believe me , it' s a war .
brutal .
exhausting .
sounds like someone just finished their vows .
ready for lights out ?
looks that way .
good night .
good night .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
what are you doing ?
getting ready to go to sleep .
here ?
you' re sleeping here ?
right here .
don' t you have a bed upstairs ?
sure do .
so does theresa .
by me sleeping here assures me that she' il get a good night' s sleep ... all alone .
good night .
sorry .
what are you doing under there ?
it' s just a pillow .
we might need a barrier .
a barrier for what ?
i tend to move around a lot in my sleep .
how do you know you move around if you' re asleep ?
theresa mentioned once that ...
i mentioned it to her ... after someone else told me ... that wasn' t theresa .
okay .
we can talk about this , right ?
theresa and i have a ...
no , you can' t talk about it . ... healthy relationship ...
stop !
we can' t talk about this ?
i don' t wanna hear you talking about sleeping with my daughter .
you' re sleeping with me now .
now , good night !
good morning .
good morning .
you' re up early .
or late , depending on how you look at it .
coffee ?
yes .
bless you .
i don' t know how you sleep with that man .
did he get in your space ?
a little bit .
did he spoon you ?
it was more of a wedge maneuver .
big man likes to cuddle in his sleep .
i just wish he were a little bit more cuddly when he was awake .
you know , when my father first met percy jones , he could not stand him .
really ?
but eventually they got along , right ?
no .
good morning !
good morning .
good morning , babe .
i missed you .
i missed you .

yeah .
who' s going with me to get some flowers ?
i' il go .
me , too , if we go early , because i have to work this afternoon .
good morning !
you' re looking awfully chipper this morning .
something about knowing your daughter' s not being violated relaxes a man .
i thought you said that mattress hurts your back .
no , not me .
i could sleep on that mattress every night .
every single night .
good morning , boss .
got you some coffee .
so , what' s the verdict ?
what are you talking about ?
i' m talking about theresa' s new boyfriend .
what is he , a painter ?
poet ?
did he ask you to borrow some money ?
my daughter' s got great taste in men .
that new guy , he' s really something .
tell me a little bit about the brother .
oh , man , thank you .
i' il tell you about the brother .
he' s a big guy .
nice looking .
what' s his name ?
jamal .
graduated howard university .
howard ?
played basketball .
he almost went pro .
till he changed his career to medicine .
there was a big write up on him in jet four years ago .
no shit .
parents from atlanta .
friends with mrs. king , dr. cosby , rev. jackson .
come on now .

great .
jerry ?
hey .
simon , what' s up ?

i need you to get me into that nanotech ipo .
i want 10 blocks .
that' s $50, 000 !
did you inherit a boatload or something ?
the initial public offering comes out on tuesday .
what do you expect me to do ?
i know when it comes out .
i set the damn date , okay ?
just buy it for me on margin .
dude , you don' t work here anymore .
i need this ipo to hold me over until i get another job .
i know you' re really screwed right now ... but do you even have $50, 000 ?
i' m gonna sell off my iras , okay ?
i' il have it in 10 days .
i can' t do margin .
i need cash .
i' m in jersey right now .
where am i gonna get cash ?
i' m sure one of those chemical plants has an atm machine .
all right , look .
i' il get the cash .
just put in the order .
cash by tuesday .
i' il bring it to you personally on monday .
don' t punk out on me .
hey .
hey .
what are you doing here ?
i feel like we didn' t get off on the right foot yesterday ... so i thought maybe ...
i' d come here and take you to lunch .
maybe we could bond a little .
i think we bonded just fine around 3 : 10 this morning when your knee was in my crotch .
right .
i' il buy .
you want to buy me lunch ?
yeah .
i figured it' s the proper thing to do after sleeping with each other .
okay .
so , nice bank .
i' m glad you like it .
i like the small town feel .
it' s less complicated .
percy , i need a loan .
right ?
and then , of course , you say , " well , yeah .
how much ?
they say , " i don' t know .
you tell me . $50, 000 ?
what , you need $50, 000 ?
do i need $50, 000 ?
yeah .
no .
i most assuredly do not .
i was just admiring the process .
how many cylinders does a nascar engine have , six or eight ?
how ...
yeah .
six ... or eight ... depending on the gas mileage consumption of the automobile .
you never worked in the pit at nascar .
you might as well admit it .
all right , you know , fine .
i never really had an aptitude for engines .
jay ...
jeff ...
jeff gordon didn' t really trust me in the pit that much .
but you did drive the cars .
drive ?
yeah .
absolutely .
good .
all right !
fine !
i never drove nascar !
but i was nervous and i wanted to impress you .
you shouldn' t have lied .
all right .
this is the deal .
we go one lap around .
if you beat me , i' il loan you the money .
really ?
i knew it !
i knew you needed the money .
i don' t need the money !
move over !
yeah .
fool !
sucker !
move it , man !
what the hell are you doing ?
i think it' s obvious who came in first .
you' re doggone right .
you know i won .
i was through the bushes before ...
i was through first .
i had more speed .
i was through the bushes and on the asphalt ...
before you even were at the bushes .
look .
dispatch , this is 53 charlie .
brian , we got a problem .
two cars have jumped ...
license and registration .
poppy !
there' s my beautiful girl .
simon , i want you to meet my granddad .
hi , there .
howard jones .
simon green .
good to meet you , sir .
nice to meet you .
hey , speed racer .
hey !
what' s with the white kid ?
that' s simon .
he' s my boyfriend .
your boyfriend ?
you didn' t tell me he was white .
yes , i did .
when ?
back at the home .
i thought you was kidding .
okay .
well , i think that' s it .
i think you' re forgetting about the vodka .
say grace , percy .
thank you , lord .
amen .
that was fast .
the lord knows i' m busy .
simon , pass on the broccoli , please .
yes , sir .
so , what , they don' t have any available young black men in new york anymore ?
they just ran out last week , grandpa .
i' m just trying to figure out why you chose to go this way .
don' t mind him .
it' s okay .
my grandmother loved you when she first met you .
but later she said some things .
i was like , " wow , grandma .
what kind of things ?
yeah , what kind of things ?
nothing .
just things .
such as ?
yeah , such as ?
daddy ?
i got it .
i know .
you know what ?
you' re gonna laugh when you hear this .
she said that theresa was a very pretty girl .
that' s so nice .
good taste .
so i ask her what she liked about you the most , right ?
she said ...
she says , " i just love her cute , little , nappy little head .
your grandmother , where does she live ?
brooklyn .
why ?
i just wanna know how far i' d have to travel to kick her old white ass , that' s why !
grandpa .
you don' t call my grandchild no nappy head !
did she say that while putting on a sheet for the klan rally ?
settle down , now !
hand me the butter .
my grandmother' s not a malicious woman .
no , she' s not .
she' s 82 .
she comes from a different time .
i' m 74 and i come from a different time .
you don' t hear me calling white folks honky and flat ass !
casper .
cracker .
ofay .
peckerwood .
wonder bread .
bird shit .
bird shit ?
it' s almost white .
that' s pretty good .
howard .
percy !
it' s okay .
i' m really sorry about what my grandmother said ... but there are some people you' re just never gonna change ...
as much as you' d like to .
yep .
i can tell you this .
last thanksgiving ... my uncle dave said a black joke at the table , right ?
so i said , right in front of the whole family , " look , that' s inappropriate .
we' re not gonna have it .
i think that' s how you change people .
you just gotta attack it one at a time .
exactly .
what was the joke ?
excuse me ?
tell the joke .
i don' t remember it .
sure you do .
tell the joke .
really , i don' t remember it .
it was ...
dad .
chicken .
excuse me ?
i didn' t stutter .
okay , you know what ?
i' il tell the joke .
no , simon .
you don' t ...
baby , it' s okay .
i' il tell you why .
because by not telling the joke , i' m empowering it .
right ?
so i' il just ... tell the joke and expose how simple minded ... and crude and unfunny it actually is .
what do you call ...
what do you call 100 black men ... buried in the ground up to their neck ?
what ?
afro turf .
that' s cute .
what are you laughing at ?
it' s cute .
cute don' t make it funny .
tell another .
dad , no .
let the man tell a joke !
i don' t know any other ones .
obviously , i' ve heard other black jokes , but i think i' ve proven my point .
so it' s okay to empower the other ones ?
okay .
i see what you' re doing here , you' re putting me on the spot .
it' s okay .
look , it' s fine .
' cause i' m not gonna back down .
back down , simon .
the only way to break down barriers is to have everything out in the open .
right ?
exactly .
so , what do you call ... one black man being chased by 300 white men ?
what ?
the pga tour .
i get it .
tiger woods .
there it is .
that' s good .
tell another one .
how do we know that adam and eve weren' t black ?
how ?
you ever try to take a rib away from a black man ?
that' s pretty good .
that' s pretty good .
i wouldn' t take one from you , i know that !
you chewing it down to the bone .
that' s a good one .
he' s a rib fan .
don' t try .
tell more .
okay .
why don' t black people like country music ?
why ?
' cause every time they say " hoe down , " they think someone shot their sister .
you gonna be all right ?
that is so true .
that' s a tailored joke for you .
why i gotta be a ho ?
ain' t nobody talking about you .
it' s a sister joke !
you' re sisters .
i' m not the " ho sister .
come on now .
can' t stop now , baby .
what are three things that a black man can' t get ?
what is that he can' t he get ?
a black eye , a fat lip , and a job .
i tell you i' m going to kick this boy' s ass !
grandpa .
no , it' s ...
we know you can take him , but just sit down .
be nice .
come on .
come on , now .
it' s a joke .
that' s right , daddy .
sit down .
it' s just a joke .
come on .
hee hee , ha ha .
that' s all it is .
now if you' il excuse me ... all of a sudden , i lost my appetite .
think i' il take a walk .
i should have stopped at " hoe down . " you should have never started .
this isn' t like us at home , laughing about this bullshit .
it' s my father' s house , simon .
what do you want me to do , go upstairs and apologize to him again ?
no .
let the storm pass .
it' il be fine .
besides , he dared you !
he double dared !
he called me chicken .
i heard !
i can' t be called chicken .
you have to watch him on those .
you know ?
i' m fresh out of ideas as to how to impress your father .
telling black jokes is never a good idea , but that' s just me .
you think ?
i' il talk to him .
say nice things about me .
no , i' m not going to say nice things about you .
you are still punished .
baby , i' m a good guy .
i like ribs , too .
i don' t ...
why are you being so mean to me ?
my grandfather' s out there .
he' s not going to come in .
this is my mom' s kitchen !
she' s not going to come in .
you' re still gonna do the dishes .
get off me .
fine , i' il do the dishes .
here , do the broccoli one .
dad , i have to talk to you .
what ?
why did you do that ?
i didn' t start it .
mr. nappy head did .
dad , simon' s a good man .
he has a good heart .
a good man ?
you put him on the spot .
you really think so ?
what is your problem with him anyways ?
besides the fact , of course , that he' s white .
you gonna get in a heap of trouble talking to me like that .
don' t care nothing about that man being white .
he' s hiding something .
what ?
nascar ?
you thought i didn' t know ?
of course i knew .
we talk about everything , simon and i.
daddy , i love him , and you need to start respecting that .
then you respect me enough to tell me in advance who you' re bringing home .
i didn' t think you' d care .
but you weren' t sure .
so you decided to test me .
no , of course not .
so you' re looking for a reaction ?
no .
so what are you looking for ?
i' m looking for you to tell me that it' s okay for me to be with him .
i' m scared .
okay ?
i' m really scared , dad .
i know things are different now and times have changed ... but you should really hear the kind of things that people say to us sometimes .
and the way they look at us .
i need you to tell me that it' s okay to be with him .
baby , me telling you it' s okay is not gonna change the world .
dad .
but it would change my world .
it will change my world if i know that you' re behind us .
i' m always behind you , sweetheart .
and i love you .
it' s my job to keep you safe .
and i don' t trust that kid .
hey , baby .
yes .
i' m trying to figure out where he got all those doggone black jokes .
what do white people do , take a class ... sit around and think of new jokes about the black man ?
i don' t know , percy .
you need to let that one go .
come on , sweetheart .
we need to practice the tango .
i told you .
i ain' t doing no doggone tango .
why ?
you think you can' t dance anymore ?
no .
i think the tango' s a stupid dance and i ain' t doing it .
marilyn ... why can' t we do the hustle ?
what' s wrong with the hustle ?
because the hustle is a stupid dance ... and i want to do the tango .
look here , woman , can' t we do this some other time ?
i gotta take dad back to the home .
i' il be back .
okay .
shut up !
all right , stop .
okay , move a little to your left .
okay .
all right , kiss me .
this is the exact spot where i had my first kiss .
no !
i' m not going to kiss you in the spot that you had your first kiss .
no .
why not ?
it' s some other guy' s spot .
fine .
what was his name ?
curtis booker .
he had these big old bucky beaver teeth .
but he was such a nice boy .
he was a good kisser , too .
better than me ?
way better .
way better ?
yeah .
did he grab your ass ?
no .
squeeze it ?
no .
we were 13 .
grab you down here ?
no .
come on !
slow down .
come on .
there' s a car !
get out of the way !
come on !
yeah !
okay , be careful .
so , this is my favorite spot .
it' s pretty amazing , huh ?
all right , so it' s not ... the top of the world , but it' s nice .
it' s a fort .
it' s a gun placement .
when i was little , i would sneak out of the house in the middle of the night ... and just come out here and just dream .
yeah ?
weren' t you afraid of sneaking out of your house ?
please .
i' m not afraid of percy jones .
well , that makes you and ... you .
okay , so this is just cranford .
but it' s a great place to grow up .
it' s a good place to raise a family , too .
you know , maybe we shouldn' t do this .
what ?
live in the suburbs ?
no .
tell your parents about our engagement this weekend .
simon , i told you not to look at him straight in the eye .
i don' t think percy jones is ready .
i think percy jones needs more time .
a lot more time for percy jones .
are you getting cold feet , simon ?
no .
no , i' m not getting cold feet .
i can' t wait to marry you .
make babies with you .
give me a daughter that looks just like you .
i can work on that .
yeah ?
yeah .
and hopefully , i can be a good dad .
i think you' il be a great dad .
you' re never gonna be like your father , simon .
maybe i can be like yours .
like percy ?
yeah .
no .
baby , percy jones is a good dad .
he' s there for you .
he cares about you .
he loves you so much .
he does .
we just have to get him to love you .
maybe we can start by getting him to take the padlock off the basement door .
it' s not going to happen .
why don' t you give me a little curtis booker ?
i can' t believe i told you that .
come on , baby , a little bucky beaver ?
no .
no .
how about some simon green ?
marilyn , you cut off the porch light ?
that' s my girl .
very stylish .
i need to take a quarter inch off the pants .
i can do it here .
let me have them .
what , you mean take the pants off ?
i could do with you in them but i don' t want to poke you with my needle .
you keep your eyes on the pants , you hear me ?
mr. jones , do you know where the extra chairs are ?
what are you , blind ?
they' re against the wall .
when you go out , close the door .
right .
percy , put some pants on .
we got people in the house .
thank you .
thank you , sweetheart .
i didn' t realize .
how long' s it gonna take ?
two shakes of a lamb' s tail .
whatever the hell that means .
mercy , percy !
keep your shirt on !
or take it off .
whatever .
could someone answer that damn phone ?
thank you !
jones residence .
this is reggie .
who' s this ?
this is theresa' s boyfriend .
jamal !
what' s up , man ?
percy told me all about you .
what' s that ?
my name is reggie .
percy told me all about you , man .
he did ?
you know what we should do ?
get together and play some hoops , man .
i don' t really play hoops .
come on , man .
don' t be shy .
why are you being shy ?
percy told me that you went to howard .
he said you almost went pro .
he said that ?
yeah .
he was bragging all about you , jamal .
but listen ... two things .
could you autograph the issue ... of jet for me ?
and the other thing is , i would love to meet the cosbys .
when i say love to meet them , i mean i love to meet them .
i' il see what i can do .
i feel like i grew up with them .
let me get percy for you .
you know , in the ' 80s and whatnot and ...
it' s for you .
it' s reggie .
we were talking about the cosbys .
may i have some privacy , please ?
but , yeah , you know what i mean ?
and shut the door .
i' d still love to meet them .
theo ...
reggie .
what did you find out ?
you were right about simon green .
he is no longer at j. p. oliver .
come on .
give me my pants .
jamal , huh ?
don' t start .
this isn' t about me .
it' s about you and your job , that you don' t have anymore .
what ?
yeah .
move out of my way .
hey , baby !
theresa !
come here , sweetheart .
daddy needs to talk to you .
don' t listen to him .
what are you talking about ?
your boyfriend' s unemployed , lost his job .
he got fired a couple days ago .
i did not get fired !
i quit !
you quit ?
why didn' t you tell me this ?
it' s complicated .
it' s complicated when you' re a liar .
i' m a liar ?
what about the lies you told reggie ?
jamal ?
who' s jamal ?
he' s good friends with the cosbys .
what about nascar ?
that was nothing , and i admitted it .
you admitted that you lied .
you tried to kill me with a go kart .
at least i can drive .
this crazy ass almost got us arrested .
now we both got court dates .
i can' t believe you checked up on me .
you kept asking me for money .
i never asked you for money .
you asked my father for money ? $50, 000 loan , baby .
i did not .
he trapped me into it .
you' re a liar .
you were checking up on him ?
he forced my hand .
you' re my daughter and he' s not worthy !
that' s not for you to decide .
right !
and what about you , lying to me ?
you said you would never lie .
you ain' t gotta go over there .
i thought i could get another job .
i was gonna tell you , but i didn' t want to ruin the big weekend .
you said we would always tell each other the truth .
like how you told your parents about me being white ?
i knew they wouldn' t care about that .
i don' t care .
i care that you' re a liar .
that' s bullshit !
you care .
he has to care .
it' s human nature .
that means that you care that i' m black ?
do you ?
dad !
no .
it doesn' t matter what i say .
you people are gonna think i' m a racist .
you hear that ?
you people . " i know .
i heard .
what people ?
the people in the yard .
that' s what i' m ...
see ?
i say one thing and i' m a racist !
no , simon , you' re a liar .
and a racist .
where do you get off calling me a racist ?
i have a black girlfriend !
you had a black girlfriend !
have .
past tense !
had !
and let me tell you something else , son ...
what the hell is going on ?
i' il tell you what' s going on .
he got fired from j. p. oliver !
i did not get fired !
i quit !
i told you to stay out of theresa' s life .
thank you .
he can' t just walk in our house , telling our baby lies .
i' m not lying !
i don' t think so !
the party' s off , percy .
woman , you must be crazy .
i don' t want to say my vows with you .
it would be a lie before god .
marilyn , we' re saying some goddamn vows tomorrow .
yeah , he got a book and everything .
would you shut up ?
you got your vows out of a book ?
no .
don' t listen to him !
i got a book .
i' m using it for inspiration .
he wrote it down word for word .
you' re going to get hurt .
that is so pathetic !
come on , marilyn !
because if memory serves me correctly , i used to be inspiration enough .
you still are !
you' d be inspiration to me .
he neglects you .
marilyn , get your ass back here !
i got a $200 cake coming tomorrow !
sixty pounds of shrimp !
sixty pounds of shrimp , woman !
i had to take a second on the house !
she looked angry .
marilyn , don' t let me raise my voice now !
you gonna force me to use the muscle !
hope you like seafood .
theresa !
wait !
come on !
they' il be back .
no , they' re not coming back .
they gotta come back .
sixty pounds of shrimp !
come on , baby .
pick it up .
answer that phone , sweetheart , and it will be your last .
let me borrow your car .
what ?
you can' t go chasing behind no women .
have some dignity !
besides , you can' t even drive a damn go kart !
trouble in paradise ?
baby , we need to talk about this .
you should call me and we should talk about it like adults ... because adults communicate when they have problems .
i' m looking at your photos on the wall and they' re beautiful .
beautiful photos .
i don' t think that i compliment you on your work enough .
you know what ?
you' re being rude .
that' s what you' re being .
so call me back .
baby , i' m sorry .
you' re not being rude .
you have all the reason in the world to be upset with me right now .
you shouldn' t be calling me back .
if i was you , i wouldn' t call me back .
baby , call me back .
call me back , baby .
i' m looking at your bulletin board and there' s a picture of you ... sitting next to a guy and i think that that guy might be curtis booker .
he looks like he' s got bucky beaver teeth .
he looks a lot older than 13 !
so i don' t know how you feel about it , but it' s gone !
old curtis booker can go bye bye !
baby , do you have any scotch tape ?
you' re acting like i cheated on you , and i' ve never cheated on you ... except for that one time with myself , and you caught me .
hello .
darlene !
how you doing ?
this is percy jones .
i' m looking for marilyn .
she left a little earlier .
i thought she' d be back by now .
i' m sorry .
now , who is this ?
percy jones .
i' m sorry , percy .
i must have fell asleep on the couch .
baby , you say you looking for marilyn ?
have you seen her ?
well , now , what happened ?
what' d you say to my sister , percy jones ?
nothing .
listen , if you hear from her , can you let me know ?
will do .
and i look forward to seeing you tomorrow at the party , right ?
yeah , it should be a lot of fun .
goodbye .
girl !
you will never guess who was just on the phone !
who ?
a mr. percy a. jones .
percy a. who ?
yeah , well , baby , he is feeling the pain now !
mom .
is that gonna be your last one ?
it might be , baby .
and it might not .
you should be over there trying to work this out with dad .
i should be over there trying to work it out with simon .
mom , please .
child , leave your mom alone .
they ain' t going nowhere .
your man quit his job and didn' t tell you .
got to nip that shit in the bud .
yes .
no .
but ...
look , i have 15 missed calls .
fifteen , mom .
fifteen !
fifteen ?
your baby got 15 missed calls !
bullshit .
let him wait !
that' s true .
i' m gonna call him now .

step .
two .

no .
i didn' t get fired from this job .
i quit .
was it over money ?
because if it wasn' t , this doesn' t make any sense .
i had a difference of opinion with the management .
they weren' t ready for a guy like me .
i don' t get it .
and heads .
no , you' re doing great .
i ain' t talking about this .
i' m talking about you and theresa .
you ain' t got nothing in common .
you don' t like sports .
theresa loves sports .
you' re a businessman .
she' s an artist .
you' re white .
she' s black .
did i miss anything ?
no .
that' s just it .
she' s everything i' m not .
you know , she' s my other half .
without her , i' m not whole .
you know , the thing about meeting your other half is ... you' re walking around , you think you' re happy ... you think that you' re whole .
then you realize you ain' t shit without her .
then you can' t go back to being a half ...
' cause now you know what it' s like to be a whole .
you know what i mean ?
yeah , i do .
and i still got it .
that was nice .
real nice .
i liked the snap .
you like that ?
i think you hurt me .
percy jones , boy .
good morning .
looks like i missed a fun night .
just sitting up here , watching football .
that' s how it always starts .
where' s marilyn ?
she stayed all night at darlene' s house .
she must be really mad .
wait .
you knew where they were the whole time ?
yeah .
i thought they' d be back by now .
did you apologize ?
i didn' t do anything .
exactly !
dante , please .
don' t try to play that metrosexual mind game on me , okay ?
okay .
all right .
let' s go get them .
you don' t understand .
they done called all their friends and sat up all night ragging on men .
they' ve worked themselves up into a man hating frenzy .
how many women ?
i guarantee you , large numbers .
sisters .
you can' t just walk in on a bunch of angry black women .
you' il die .
well , we' il just have to go out like men .
he' s right , percy .
i know he' s right .
but i' m still scared .
keep talking .
what are you saying ?
like that , a little .
i' m liking it .
thank you .
you gonna share your colors ?
you' re one of them sisters who don' t share colors .
no , i' m not .
give up your secrets , honey .
this is gorgeous .
pink passion .
every woman needs this .
a little pink passion ?
you know what i always say ?
a little bit of makeup , a little bit of hair ain' t never hurt nobody .
how did i know she would be wearing pink passion ?
yes , they' re in there .
maybe i should go first .
are you crazy ?
i' m the one that got experience in this sort of thing .
you just pay attention .
i' il show you how it' s done .
here , straighten yourself up .
if you go up in there , you go in looking like a man .
wipe this off .
you got something .
thank you .
yeah .
man , i' m not gonna ...

we gotta do this .
well , well , well .
if it isn' t mr. percy jones .
it is i.
it' s about time you showed up .
what' s up ?
i' m well .
percy .
marilyn .
marilyn , may i speak to you in private over there , please ... so the ladies can continue eating ?
oh , no !
you go on home with that .
it' s not going down like that , my brother .
no way , no how .
you know better than that , percy .
you got something to say , say it here .
in front of everybody .
step up to the chalk line and be a man .
i married you , didn' t i ?
don' t that count for something ?
hell , no !
what does he want , an award ?
that don' t count for nothing !
it really doesn' t count .
come on , man .
i know , i' m just ...
oh , hell .
i was wrong , okay ?
it' s a good start , percy .
keep going !
i' ve been wrong for a long time .
ever since i forgot ... that you are my better half .
hell , marilyn , you' re everything i' m not .
without you , i' m not whole .
look .
let ...
baby , before i met you , i thought i was all that .
and then you came into my life , and i realized that i wasn' t all that .
wasn' t even half of that .
i might have been a quarter of that .
but then you left me last night !
and , baby , i remembered how it felt to be without you .
and let me tell you something .
i ain' t shit without you !
dad .
man .
and i forgot about that .
and i' m sorry .
baby , marry me .
make me whole again .
i love you , percy .
i love you , too .
that' s what i' m talking about , baby .
you go , marilyn , bad girl !
kiss your baby .
i missed you so much .
i missed you .
i couldn' t sleep at all last night .
i' m sorry , baby .
i feel so much better !
isn' t that lovely ?
get off that .
i guess it' s my turn .
all right .
that' s going to be a tough speech to follow .
it was a great speech , perce .
thank you .
i had something similar in mind .
great minds think alike .
admitting you were wrong would be a great start .
yes , it would .
right .
go ahead , man .
baby , i was wrong !
what are you doing ?
i want to see your sexy body go bump , bump , bump .
we have to talk in private .
i don' t wanna hear it .
no .
mom ?
just stay here and talk about it in front of everybody !
ladies , please .
take your man and go work out your business .
that' s right .
go on .
thank you .
don' t let him work on you .
that ain' t right .
did he say " bump , bump , bump " ?
yeah , and it' s percy' s fault .
it' s all your fault !
those kids are in love and they finally liked each other and you all interfere .
my love right here .
don' t tell me how to define my love !
lord have mercy .
baby .
come on .
i was trying to impress your father .
i didn' t want to show up here and be the unemployed fianc .
i' ve never lied to you before and i' il never lie to you again , ever .
you lied about asking my father for a loan .
that was an omission that was tied to a previous lie .
that doesn' t ...
and i look like an idiot to you .
no .
you look a little bit like percy jones , though .
i can' t believe you' re trying to be funny .
baby , come on .
why do you have to be funny right now ?
don' t touch me !
you need to calm down .
you made me look like an asshole in there .
don' t tell me to calm down .
i think you were doing a pretty good job of that yourself .
not telling them about me ?
and then i pitched in and i blew it , okay ?
i panicked when i found out that nathan was blackballing me .
i thought if i could score this ipo , i' d have enough money until i got another job .
but i was doing that for you .
what am i , your mother ?
i don' t need you to take care of me .
i want you to do things with me , not for me , simon !
will you just talk to me ?
i am talking to you .
you' re talking at me .
i am talking to you .
but you need to talk to me and tell me how am i supposed to believe in you ... when you don' t trust me enough to tell me the truth ?
how do we get past this , with this skin , if we don' t have each other' s back ?
okay , i' m always gonna be the white boy .
and i' il always be the black girl .
but at least i' m here and willing to deal with it , and i don' t know about you .
i don' t know .
and eventually , if you' re gonna quit on me , just do it and don' t ...
i' m standing right here !
what more do you want from me ?
what do you want from the white boy ?
i' ve been here busting my ass to make you happy !
then let me make this easy for you !
the engagement is off !
fine .
good .
great .
great .
i' m in jersey !
okay , stand still now .
i' m still .
you all right ?
i' m fine .
i' m great .
it' s going to be a great day , dad .
it sure is .
yes .
i' m gonna take lots of pictures .
so you better smile big for me , okay ?
i will .
and no crying .
mom said you cried last time .
i was not crying , i was sweating ... from my eyeballs .
hell , i was nervous .
i knew i was making a big mistake .
a 25 year mistake .
and going for 25 more .
sweetheart ?
why don' t you call that man ?
you know he got his cell phone on .
you know he does .
he' s probably waiting on the 5 : 15 train .
we got a party going on .
you get his ass back here !
how many missed calls you have last night ?
thirty three .
thirty three ?
yeah .
thirty three ?
yeah .
thirty three missed calls ?
sweetheart , that' s major .
and you know the man is unemployed , yes , but he calls you .
so give him that .
thirty three missed calls ?
and you can' t call him once ?
girl , don' t be so proud .
no .
daddy , it' s not ...
pride ain' t nothing when it comes to matters of the heart .
it' s not that .
it' s not ?
no .
i was going to marry him .
what ?
we were going to announce our engagement this weekend .
so , you see ?
i have you to thank ... because you saved me from a big heartache .
sweetheart , i just don' t understand something .
why did simon quit his job ?
i don' t know .
he didn' t say .
why would a man quit his job on the day he' s gonna meet his future father in law ?
maybe he got tired of waiting for that promotion that never happened .
simon' s a rising star , dad .
he really is .
i believe that .
but that boss of his is just not a nice man .
you ever met him ?
a couple of times .
he was always friendly , kind of .
but he always had this look in his eyes , you know ?
just not a nice man .
but he was simon' s mentor , so ...
whatever .
let it go .
today is about you and mom .
now , first picture of the night .
let me get my ...
on my good side .
smile .
i don' t want mom to see me like this .
i love you , dad .
i love you , too .
damn !
no .
do not do this to me , percy jones !
we have a schedule !
tick tock .
everything works .
timing .
i' il be right back .
timing !
i' il be right back .
in 10 minutes ?
or so , okay ?
how so ?
i' m sorry .
percy , have you met my wife , diane ?
i certainly have heard a lot about you , percy jones .
nice to meet you .
does marilyn know you' re going awol ?
of course .
she does not .
so you missed your train , huh ?
there' s another one at 6 : 00 .
you gonna be on it ?
i should have been on that one .
what are you doing here ?
i know why you quit your job .
don' t marry that black girl .
those weren' t exactly the words .
how did you know we were getting married ?
i told you , son .
don' t nothing get past percy jones .
theresa told you .
that , too .
come on , man .
let' s get real .
what you did with your boss was honorable , impressive ... and stupid .
you can' t quit your job every time somebody rolls their eyes at the two of you .
you' il never make any money .
how do you do 25 years ?
painfully .
no , seriously .
if you' re gonna marry one of these women , sometimes it' s gonna hurt like hell .
all you can do is admit that you' re wrong and know that she' s always right .
she' s right ?
that' s right .
always ?
right .
right .
that' s right .
all right .
okay , what about all the talk about my dignity ?
do you love her ?
do you want her ?
then she' s always right .
look , i know i didn' t give you a fair shake .
and i was wrong .
and my daughter , she' d be lucky to have you .
i' m not a quitter , mr. jones .
i think i know that about you .
theresa doesn' t .
you just have to show her what you' re made of .
you know she' s hot headed .
she' s just like her mama .
every man gets to choose his destiny , son .
no matter what his father did .
and , percy , you are not perfect .
but that works for me because two perfect people in one relationship ... might be too much .
and sometimes you bark and bluff and bluster ... but i always see the boy i married 25 years ago .
and i only wish i loved him as much as i did back then , but i don' t .
i love him more .
thank you , marilyn .
that was lovely .
percy ?
your vows ?
marilyn jones .
everyone knows i didn' t write my vows .
everyone knows because you kept beating me up about it for weeks ... crying to all your friends .
you know ?
now , look here , woman .
i love you .
but you didn' t have to do me like that about my vows .
you know i don' t like writing .
she knows that .
i' m not a wordsmith .
i do numbers .
that' s me .
i don' t do words .
damn it , i do money .
and after 25 years , all i' ve asked you ... is to let me be me .
you' il never find
as long as you shall live
oh , lord .
someone to love you
love you , love you
tender like i do
you know that about me , woman .
you' il never find
no matter where you search
i' m not looking .
someone to care about you
care about you , care about you
the way i do
oh , i' m not bragging on myself , baby
but i' m the only one that loves you
i think i forgot what love is until you and simon showed up .
give that man another chance , daughter .
you' il never find
simon !
yes , simon .
it' il take the end of all time
someone who understands you
like i do
that' s not jamal .
i could probably find a million reasons why we shouldn' t be together .
but you know what ?
i don' t care .
i don' t care , either .
i love you .
and i' m sorry that i lied to you .
i' m sorry , too .
you' re sorry ?
can you say that again ?
i' m sorry , simon .
you' re sorry ?
she said she was sorry .
i believe she' s ...
i' m sorry , simon .
get your man , girl !
go ahead , sweetie !
ladies and gentlemen , it gives me great pleasure ... to introduce to you all my future son in law , simon green .
he' s broke , unemployed , and he' s white .
but he loves my theresa and that' s all right with us .
that' s right .
welcome to the family , son .
welcome to the family .
and cue the magic .
look at this .
will you look at that shit ?
drink up !
enjoy !
welcome , man .
let' s watch the tango .
no , let' s watch the party .
all right .
get your feet off the table .
sorry , sir .
i look pretty good out there .
you do , mom .
baby , you look so good because you' re twirling around me .
oh , yeah , there you go , there you go .
all right , you blew that part .
that was perfect .
there was hesitation there .
you did it better the night before .
the night before ?
what happened ?
we had a little dry run the night before .
really ?
you didn' t tell me that , percy !
you' re hallucinating , simon .
i ain' t never danced with no man in my life .
taught him everything he knows .
percy jones was born knowing how to tango .
and let me tell you something about the tango .
it' s a structured dance .
i told you that .
what was that , mom ?
you know what that is , theresa .
you' re a grown ass woman .
damn , mama , you still got it .
i know it , keisha .
all right now , watch this .
this is when i got funky .
go , percy !
it' s your birthday !
go , percy .
let' s watch the vows .
no !
watch the party .
okay , fine , whatever .
there you are .
i got her , that girl is mine !
i was just shocked you didn' t fall down .
that is cold .
look .
check me out .
i am doing the hustle .
i' m doing the hustle in your honor , percy jones .
that ain' t no damn hustle .
that' s the white man overbite .
you ain' t even doing that right .
why' s it gotta be a white thing ?
blacks have overbites , too .
he' s doing a great hustle !
he' s turning it up .
why is my man looking at your ass ?
no , he' s not .
why is your man samoan ?
where is manu these days ?
we broke up last week .
thank you , jesus .
what happened ?
i only started going out with him to mess with daddy .
and , girl , please .
he is too big .
he is a bone crusher .
watch your mouth !
what ?
do not use the word " bone " in my house .
where were you all going ?
let' s see that again .
your mother and i got a sudden thirst for punch .
no .
you' re old enough to know .
we going to shake some sheets .
is that all right with you ?
i thought you said no bone in the house !
no !
if everyone wants to see the lift , we do the lift .
we' re doing the lift !
this is good .
no .
i was so sure you were going to drop me there .
i love you !
this is dirty dancing .
i' ve been doing this since high school .
look at that .
who' s the man ?
you did it with other girls ?
no , i only do that with you .
i know that hurt .
see that move right there .
that' s why you' re not getting any grandkids .
let me call your mama right now and thank her for those dance lessons .
that' s a low blow .
it' s just a joke .
simon !
come on .
i' il catch your big ass .
we' re down !
good thing is , she didn' t break that dress .
no , she didn' t , but she felt bad about it all week .
they gotta go deep .
i knew better .
oh , my god .
that was a great party .
it was , mom .
yeah , i guess a party not a party till something get broke .
