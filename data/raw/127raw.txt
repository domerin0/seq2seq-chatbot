i hate television ... gives me headaches .
you know i heard there were so many magnetic waves travelling through the air because of tv and telephones then we' re losing like 10 times as many braincells as we' re supposed to
like ... all molecules in our heads are all unstable , all the companies know about it but they' re not doing anything about it it' s a big conspiracy .
you can pick something , i don' t care .
do you have any idea how many electro rays are travelling through our head every second ?
i got a better one ... have you heard about this videotape that kills you when you watch it ?
what kind of tape ?
a tape ... a regular tape
people run it ... i don' t know
you start to play it ... and it' s like somebody' s nightmare then suddenly this woman comes on smiling at you , right ? seeing you through the screen
and as soon as it' s over your phone rings
someone knows you' ve watched it .
' you will die in 7 days . '
and exactly 7 days later ...
who told you that ? ... somebody from revere ...
who told you ?
what' s your problem ?
i' ve watched it
it' s a story , katie !
no , me and josh .
we saw it last weekend .
i thought you were with your parents !
i wanted to tell you ...
you were with josh all weekend ?
some of his friends got this place up in the mountains
they were trying to record a football game
i guess the reception was so bad
what are you talking about ... ?
listen to me !
we played the tape , the game wasn' t there .
it was ...
what ?
what was it ?
it was something else ...
we thought it was some kind of sick joke but then the phone rang
it was a week ago a week ago tonight .

no worries .
i want my own car .
have you got a moment , miss keller ?
um , sure !
call me rachel .
please , sit down .
he certainly is very independent , isn' t he ?
oh yeah .
he sure is .
i never have to tell him to do anything .
well , if that' s a problem you' d be the first teacher in history to say so .
miss keller ...
rachel .
i know that aidan miss and just lost his cousin ... yes , and i' m doing what i can to find him some good daycare , it' s just ...
no , that' s not what i meant .
by all means , take your time .
i know they were very close .
aidan and his cousin .
yeah .
they spent a few nights a week together .
did he talk to you about her death ?
well , like you said , he' s not the talkative type .
that doesn' t mean he has nothing to say .
he knows i' m there .
yes , i' m sure he does .
but he may be expressing himself in .... other ways .
i' d like to show you something .
that' s his cousin .
that' s katie .
miss keller ... i' m bothered by these drawings .
listen ... i appreciate your concern .
but my son lost his best friend 3 nights ago .
he' s just trying to deal with it .
yes , i understand , but these pictures are aidan' s way of working it out . of expressing himself , like you said .
he' il be okay .
you say she died 3 nights ago .
yeah , that' s right .
aidan drew these last week .
what ?
nothing .
should we read something ?
i' m kinda tired .
okay .
sweet dreams .
we don' t have enough time .
honey , i know we' ve been working a lot and i' m sorry , but i promise you i' m gonna make it up to you .
i' m not talking about that .
i' m talking about time before we die .
you have lots of time .
so you know when i' m going to die ?
no .
no one does .
but i know you don' t have to worry about it .
katie knew .
she told me .
katie told you she was gonna die ?
she said she didn' t had enough time .
good night , rachel .
shit !
aidan ? !
god damn it !
honey ? !
have you seen my black dress ?
aidan ?
have you seen my black .... dress ?
it' s a little wrinkled .
it' s fine .
oh ruthie .
i' m so sorry .
are you alright , dave ?
yeah , i' m fine .
how are you ?
he sleeps all day doesn' t move it' s too much for him .
it doesn' t make any sense , rachel .
i spent 4 hours on the internet and i couldn' t find one single case of a 16 year old girl' s heart just stopping .
i spoke to 3 different doctors and not one of them could tell me exactly what happened to my daughter .
she was close .... with you and aidan
she confided in you .
yeah , but she never said anything .
nothing that would have explained what happened .
you could find out .
it' s what you do , isn' t it ?
ask questions ?
rachel , please
i saw her face .
... i mean she was a little intense , but she wasn' t crazy .
and who put you into this straitjacket if you just freaked out ?
something scared the shit out of her .
hi .
so who' s in the mental hospital ?
becca .
katie' s friend .
oh , right .
she was the one who was ... ... there .
when it happened .
so what do you think they were doing up there ?
oh , thanks .
i remember i was that age me and my girlfriend used to sneak up to my room , get high do you think maybe she was into ... ... it' s not about that .
it' s about the tape .
alan , don' t even ...
what tape ?
the one that kills you when you watch it .
oh , please
what was on the tape ?
i haven' t seen it , obviously .
but katie told you she saw this tape .
not katie , i heard it from her boyf ...

she was dating this guy josh
he goes to revere .
it was kind of a secret .

josh ... is he here ?
josh is dead .

aidan

hi , i' m sorry ... ... pick a card !
any card .
go ahead !
put it back .
don' t let me see it .
that your card ?
no
damn
i was wondering if you' d remember someone from a week ago
is there a problem ?
it' s my niece .
she sort of ran out on her parents .
no
i have some photos here .
that' s her , and her friends
i think they stayed here a night or so .
yeah .
they were in cabin 12 .
they didn' t pay .
they had a number of complaints .
bout the tv mainly .
reception is never good here .
that' s why we bought tape players for videos
quite a selection .
mostly they' re hand me downs left by the guests .
anyway they didn' t pay and kids like that sometimes don' t
miss ?
you know ... ... i' m kind of tired .
i' m thinking i might take a nap before i drive back .
i' il take cabin 12 .
hey !
this is your card , right ?
that' s it !
seven days
i' m going to school !
what do you think ?
pretty cool effect
what does this have to do with the tape ?
take my picture .
are you gonna look at me at least ?
this the same camera ?
no
scan the rest .
so ?
what do you think ?
i thought you said this was about a tape .
i' m thinking maybe you shouldn' t see it .
no , i should know more about it first .
well isn' t that why i' m here ?
so you can benefit from my wisdom ?
4 kids are dead , noah .
not from watching a videotape .
show it to me .
no credits
that was very student film .
um , sure it' s a lot scarier at night
you' re gonna get that ?
so , you' ve been working a lot ?
i' m not tired , noah !
ok
that tape didn' t scare you ?
no , not really .
sorry .
4 people are dead !
like i said ... 4 people who watched it
come on , we watched it
it ... takes ... a week .
right
you know i' m just gonna go downtown , i gotta pick up some cameras from this guy and then i gotta prep this thing , i may not do it next weekend ...
noah would you say that i' m gullible ?
no
easily rattled ?
definitely not a little highly strung maybe you ain' t much of a dresser
who made it ?
where did it come from ?
alright make me a copy , i' il see what i can do .
thanks
you sure this is a copy ?
yeah , why ?
the numbers are all screwed up .
same problem got copied , i guess .
that' s impossible .
the numbers of the control track , they' re put on the tape whenever it' s recorded which means theoretically there shouldn' t be any images
hey , noah , can you pretend for 1 minute that i don' t read video geek magazine ?
okay , when you record a tape the makeup of the tracks is like a signature for whatever did the recording
like a camcorder , vcr , whatever so the control tracker tells where it came from .
but to not have one , i mean that' s like being born without fingerprints .
then how did this get recorded ?
i don' t know .
but i' m gonna find out
alright , take a look you should be able to see the camera here in the reflection .
the angle is straight on , but you don' t
mmm ... what' s that ?
looks like she' s walking away whoever she is
no , i mean up there at the top .
uh , that' s just the tracking , i can fix that .
wait !
go back .
there' s something there .
yeah , you' re right .
there' s more picture .
hold on .
i' m gonna stretch the alignment
yeah , it' s working .
ok , keep going .
nonono , let me do it !
come on !
what are you doing ?
let me do it !
shit !
hey noah !
i picked up the cameras .
they' re in really good shape .
did you see the reports i did about that guatemala stuff ?
it came out kind of ... overexposed
you' re working ?
this is a friend ... rachel keller .
she writes for the p. i.
rachel , this is beth , my assistant .
wanna prefer partner in crime ?
she' s a journalism student at kirkland actually .
oh .
i' il stay out of your way .
i' m not even here .
rachel is researching the story , of this video hoaxes , sort of interesting .
you know video , why don' t you come and look at this thing with the tracking ?
you know i' m late .
i really should go .
yeah , but why are you taking the ...
i gotta go !
it' s good to meet you .
you' re taking the tape ?
i don' t want her to see it .
whoa !
you don' t want her to see , what about me seeing it ?
you had no problem showing it to me .
i did have a problem !
you' re angry .
i' m not angry
oh no ?
what are you then ?
in a hurry .
i' m sorry , but i' m not gonna get all worked up over some high school rumour .
what are you thinking ?
i' m thinking this is the part where i say you' re a flake , never finishes anything , and you say i' m an obsessive bitch , needs to lighten up , then i storm out , all pissed off , kicking myself for ever thinking that you could just ... grow up !
so why don' t we just cut to that part right now and save ourselves a lot of grief !
alright !
bye .
watch out missy !
bad luck .
we don' t need that .
becca ?
becca .
you are almost there .
do you remember anything about that night ?
that night with katie .
do you remember how she died ?
becca ?
she told you about a video tape , didn' t she ?
she was afraid , wasn' t she ?
something was happening to her .
becca ... how did she die ?
please
i need to know .
and you will .
she' il show you .
who ?
who will show me ?
not now .
4 days
yeah , well your home vcr : s will give you a tracking wind up , but they won' t let you stretch it so no point really , unless we' re talking restoration .
archives will come in here with these primual tapes sometimes , tracks totally shot , servos can' t line them up , big box , here' s the most totally ..... will read to the very edge of your tape .
just don' t force her , or she' il get pissy with you .
your tracking , your monitor , your printer .
so , what are we watching ?
home movies or something ?
i really rather watch it alone .
really
whatever
come on
come on

... i believe you .
rachel , you there ?
he watched the tape .

who watched it ?
our son
you took some picture .
i' ve seen you .
while i' m in the yard at school .
you were there .
you wish i was around more ?
no
you wanna be around more ?
rachel and i we' re ...
wrong
mom' s told me that story .
the thing is
i don' t think i' il make a good father .
maybe it was because my own was such a disappointment .
and i don' t want anyone else to do it either .
your father
it' s a conundrum .
yeah , it is .
time to go , mister .
i' m not finished .
noah said to make one for you .
you could almost draw a line through her life .
a once ... happy woman who spends her time with her husband .
riding horses , everything sheltered , protected and comfortable .
her face , there' s ... light .
there' s pride .
and then one day something happens and she takes this hard corner and then light ... goes out .
and then she ends up in eola county psychiatric , all alone .
what happened to her ?
i don' t know yet , but i think it has something to do with the horses .
i think we should go to the island together .
it' s tuesday , noah .
i only have 1 day left .
i need you to go to the hospital , and find out as much as you can about anna .
the images on the tape relieves somewhere .
katie saw them all , too .
i think
before you die , you see the ring .
shit
hey , rach !
