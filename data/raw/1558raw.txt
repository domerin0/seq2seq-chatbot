miss , you okay ?
<i>i can' t remember when i had my first waking nightmare . </ i>
<i>they' re too disturbing to call daydreams . </ i>
<i>i never talked about them with anyone . </ i>
<i>they never made any sense to me ... </ i> <i>then i found the pathway . </ i>
<i>now they' re all clear , every one of them . </ i>
breakfast of champions .
when was the last time you slept ?
<i>i' m happy i can stand , man .
i' m on a three day rage . </ i>

no , man , no .
are you crazy ?
what , do you want to get arrested ?
where did you get this ?

happy birthday .
the need to worship god , to protect the family ... to coexist in harmony with nature .
now , from these very ideas stories were created ... and passed down from one generation to another ... each having its own central hero character .
want to see what you missed ?
<i>if i wanted to see it , i wouldn' t have missed it . </ i>
campbell termed this ennobled path ...
just trying to be helpful .
what a shame .
i thought you wanted to get in my pants .
it is my birthday .
works for me .
but little more than the stories we grow up hearing ... and the tradition of telling them ... is what binds together even the most disparate of societies .
happy birthday , handsome .

<i>i was building a ramp for my mom' s wheelchair ... </ i> and father moore came by to visit .
they were all inside watching football , dallas tampa game .
dallas lost .
that was your weirdest family holiday ?
so i had a hammer in my hand ... and i look up and father moore was smiling at me ... and all i could think about is just bashing his head in .
<i>over and over , and then i' d smash my parents ' heads in . </ i>
<i>then , like , half the people i knew , just ... </ i>
so then i started thinking , what else would i like to do ?
and all this crazy shit came into my head .
so then what happened ?
i finished the ramp , and we ate turkey .
<i>dude , that' s sick even for me . </ i>
<i>dude , i' ve castrated my dad 112 times in my dreams . </ i>
three of a kind , huh ?
<i>let' s play a real fucked up game . </ i>
<i>" welcome to the pathway . " </ i>
the pathway .
<i>i' ve never played this before . </ i>
<i>dakota , it' s a secret . </ i>
<i>well , it' s not a very good secret if you know about it . </ i>
serious .

what kind of bizarre things ?
<i>well , you don' t know unless you play . </ i>
how do you start ?

happy birthday .
<i>oh , shit .

since when are you into voodoo ?
<i>they' re spiritual interpretations of universal ideas . </ i>
<i>that' s what it said on the box . </ i>
so what did it have to say about these guys ?
<i>" the figures suggest youth , love , and virginity ... </ i>
<i>" before they' re corrupted by desire . " </ i>
remember taking my virginity ?
if i recall , i think it was you that took mine .
details .
should we light a candle or something ?
so much for cuddling .
well , jake , you got what you wanted ... and i get to keep playing the pathway .
you just made love to me because the pathway told you to ?

<i>like you' ve ever really given a shit about me , jake . </ i>
like any man ever has .
see you on campus .
hello .
<i>feeling distracted ? </ i>
beats watching tv .
<i>are you ready for another test ? </ i>
<i>i thought that was dakota' s test . </ i>
<i>besides , it' s not exactly our first time . </ i>
<i>with her in control it was . </ i>
i thought the point was to entertain me .
<i>no , the point was to see what' s inside your head . </ i>
<i>dinner' s ready . </ i>
trying to break my hand ?
<i>what' s the matter , you pull something ? </ i>
just throw the goddamn ball .
let me see .
darius do that ?
with a little help .
<i>damn it , connie , i can' t baby sit you day and night . </ i>
who asked you to ?
<i>don' t give me that shit .
i' ve been covering your back since we were nine . </ i>
<i>why don' t you stop already ? </ i>
okay .
sorry , man .
<i>i think i' m building up a resistance to my medication . </ i>
<i>yeah , i think we' re both losing it . </ i>
<i>listen to this shit .
the other night , i' m down in the basement . </ i>
i get a phone call from the pathway .
<i>i turn around .
there' s a big creature staring at me . </ i>
a creature .
half man , half woman .
anyway , i have this dream where i go upstairs ... and i shoot my dad in the back of the head .
has trippy stuff like that been happening to you ?
every goddamn day .
great .
<i> i' il take it easy on you .
right . </ i>
<i> hello .

<i>why didn' t you give me a shout ? </ i>

<i>why don' t we get breakfast in the morning ? </ i>
<i>okay .

dude , what the fuck do you want now ?
<i>nobody knows how fucked up you really are . </ i>
<i>and nobody really gives a fuck , do they ? </ i>
what the fuck !
connie .
<i>connie , let' s go get some breakfast , bud . </ i>
or more like lunch .
connie , wake up .
uncle ross .
<i>he didn' t sound good .
i should have come over . </ i>
you could have wound up dead , too .
<i>conrad wasn' t a psychopath . </ i>
he was always on the edge .
this thing with darius just pushed him over it .
<i>no .
those guys would fight one day , and then they' d get high the next . </ i>
<i>i' m sure their parents will be comforted to hear that . </ i>
did you help conrad steal that gun ?
what ?
<i>the serial numbers matched a .
38 stolen from sid' s sporting goods last week . </ i>
<i> that' s impossible .
why is that ? </ i>
because i threw that gun into cove lake .
you what ?
<i>i took a gun from connie ... </ i>
<i>i didn' t want him to get in trouble , so i threw it in the lake . </ i>
how would conrad have gotten the gun back ?
<i>he couldn' t have . </ i>
this is a bad time to start lying to me .
<i>i' m not lying to you . </ i>
<i>you think i don' t want to find out what went on in there ? </ i>
you going to tell my sister or am i ?
yeah , i want to go to the hospital now , if i can .
<i>you know , i' m your uncle . </ i>
you could have brought the gun to me .
are you okay ?
<i>it' s the worst day of my life . </ i>
you want to talk about it ?
not here .
meet me in front in five minutes .
okay ?
okay .
<i>i just don' t want to end up like my father . </ i>
go to work at 6 : 00 , come home at 8 : 00 .
do it all over again the next day .
what do you want to do ?
i wish i knew .
have you ever thought about leaving here ?
<i> who' d bring my mom orchids ?
i' m sure she would love postcards . </ i>
looks like you like to travel .
yeah .
i like collecting things .
how did you end up here ?
a man .
<i>sorry , i didn' t mean to pry . </ i>
<i>no , it' s okay .
i' m just enjoying this one too much . </ i>
so how about you ?
are you seeing anybody ?
took you long enough to ask .
i take that as a no .
no .
<i>but who knows , i could always run into someone when i' m not expecting it . </ i>
that never happens .
what timing .
all i want to do is leave this town , and you just got here .
we just have to meet somewhere in the middle .
okay .
well , you were right .
the day did get better .
<i>i' m sorry about your friend . </ i>
<i>so i' m going to try to play it cool and not call you for at least an hour , okay ? </ i>
okay .
bye , jake .
bye .
i remember when you and connie first met in sunday school .
<i>you' re drinking ? </ i>
<i>well , i' m not praying . </ i>
<i>you' re going to throw away five years just like that ? </ i>
<i>you think i don' t know what you and conrad have been doing to yourselves , son ? </ i>
<i>you think i don' t know that ? </ i>
what conrad did has nothing to do with me .
<i>he' s gone to hell . </ i>
<i>i don' t have to listen to this . </ i>
wait just a minute , jake .
wait a minute .
wait .
<i>we' re not going to be able to save you now . </ i>
<i>don' t preach to me with a drink in your hand , dad . </ i>
you ungrateful punk .
you realize that we have sacrificed everything for you here ?
sacrificed ?
you sacrificed ?
<i>i could' ve gone anywhere , i could' ve done anything ... </ i> but i stayed here for you , i stayed here for mom .
what did you ever give up for me ?
my beautiful wife .
what does that mean ?
<i> i thought i could do this , but i can' t .
thought you could do what ? </ i>
<i>what are you trying to tell me ?
you' re blaming me for the way mom is ... </ i> <i>for the accident ?
you' re gonna blame me for that now ? </ i>
<i>the day after my best friend kills himself , you' re gonna blame me for that ? </ i>
<i>it' s not very much , though , jake . </ i>
the day i need you the most , the day i need help , the day i need my father ... you do this ?
shame on you .
jake ?
<i>i don' t know whether to cry or scream . </ i>
i know what you mean .
you know , i called you six times .
<i>i' m really sorry about what happened the other night . </ i>
<i>don' t worry about it . </ i>
<i> so why didn' t you call me back ?
i was hanging out with a friend . </ i>
who is she ?
her name is marisol .
<i> sounds exotic .
she' s different . </ i>
<i> i' m super late .
dakota , hey . </ i>
you heard what conrad did to himself , right ?
<i>can' t stop thinking about it . </ i>
well , the other night , after i got off the phone with the pathway ...
i had a dream where i did the same thing to myself .
you think that the pathway has something to do with what conrad did to himself ?
yeah , maybe .
are you still playing ?
<i>it hasn' t asked me to corrupt anyone else , if that' s what you' re asking . </ i>
all right .
do me a favor .
anything .
stop .
sure .
<i>come by the tomahawk tonight .
dinner' s on me . </ i>
and bring your friend .
you sure you want company tonight ?
no , but i like being with you .
good .
<i>okay , now i' m jealous . </ i>
marisol , this is dakota .
nice to meet you .
<i> god , marisol .
that' s such a beautiful name .
thank you . </ i>
<i> what does it mean ?
it' s spanish for " sun and sea . " </ i>
oh , my parents named me for where i was conceived .
i would really love to stay here and chat with you guys ... but my boss is totally riding my ass .
<i>it' s okay .
we' re just going to do take out . </ i>
so two burgers , two fries , and two beers .
<i> we' re not staying ?
no .
i got a surprise for you . </ i>
now this would be the part where i get ill .
<i>sorry .
looking for the men' s room . </ i>
<i>you know where the men' s room is , professor .
you eat here twice a week . </ i>
so , have you thought about our little conversation after class ?
<i>professor , you twist that ring any harder , and your finger' s going to come off . </ i>
<i>i' ve got plenty more . </ i>
asshole !
<i> tomahawk .
even hartney knows you are weak . </ i>
<i>every man does . </ i>
<i>why do you think jake would never be with you for more than one night ? </ i>
<i>he knows you' ve fucked all his friends . </ i>
<i>who wants a girl like that ? </ i>
<i>i know .
it wasn' t your fault . </ i>
<i>daddy was a monster . </ i>
<i>but then , let' s face it . </ i>
<i>lots of girls have bad fathers , and they don' t end up like you . </ i>
<i>get used to it . </ i>
<i>you let hartney fuck you over ... </ i> <i>and you' re going to be working in dumps like this for the rest of your miserable life . </ i>
<i> is that what you want ?
fuck you . </ i>
fuck all of you !
<i>that' s my girl .
didn' t that feel good ? </ i>
<i>don' t you understand that i want to help you ... </ i> <i>make you feel better ... </ i> <i>help you get even with hartney before it' s too late . </ i>
yes .
<i>don' t be afraid .
it' s time to play . </ i>
when i was nine months old , my folks moved here from seattle ... <i>to be near my uncle , my mother' s brother . </ i>
there was a blizzard and my dad lost control of the car .
it was a miracle any of us survived .
<i>there' s a higher power looking out for you . </ i>
is she okay ?
<i> i' il call her later .
we are late .
late for what ? </ i>
<i>it' s so worth the pain .
i promise . </ i>
i need some more medicine , nurse .
ready ?
yeah .
one , two , three , go .
i hope you can fight .
i never put an orchid on a guy before .
<i>it' s for my mother , walt . </ i>
<i>okay , now you' re breaking my heart . </ i>
sorry .
quit smoking yesterday .
great .
jake .
what have you and your friends gotten into ?
nothing .
first conrad , now dakota kills your professor and mutilates herself .
this is no coincidence .
you could be next .
i am not going to let that happen .
all right , can you take him home ?
make sure he gets some sleep ?
listen to me .
first thing tomorrow morning , you meet me at my cabin .
no one will disturb us there .
<i>but we' re not leaving until you tell me everything you know . </ i>
uncle ross .
nine points ?
<i>didn' t hear you drive in . </ i>
so , how are you holding up ?
fine .
yeah ?
<i>what' s in the ground ? </ i>
<i>after a hunt , we bury the animal' s remains . </ i>
native american ritual i taught jake when he was a kid .
<i>returns the animal' s soul to the earth . </ i>
well , come on in .
when we started , the pathway was just a game ... that had this strange ability of knowing what we were thinking .
but then conrad used the gun that i threw into the lake ... and then cuts his tongue off ... the way that i did after a beast in a dream tells me to .
<i>so i' m thinking maybe it wasn' t a dream .
maybe it isn' t just a game . </ i>
<i>i feel like i' m going insane . </ i>
<i>no , i think you' re just looking for an answer for something so horrible it has none . </ i>
i like it here .
<i>it' s peaceful . </ i>
thanks .
well , i have to meet the fbi in my office in a couple hours .
<i>i' il ask them to check on this computer game of yours . </ i>
<i>why don' t you spend the night here ? </ i>
it might do you some good .
sheriff north .
what is it ?
<i>something' s wrong . </ i>
<i>i' m sorry , i think we ought to go . </ i>
okay .
jake , talk to me .
shit .
give rest , o christ , to your servant with your saints .
where sorrow and pain are no more .
neither sighing , but life everlasting .
you only are immortal , the creator and maker of all .
we are mortal , formed of the earth ... and to the earth we shall return .
<i>" you are dust , and to dust you shall return . " </ i>
all of us go down to the dust ... yet even at the grave we make our song .
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah .
<i>you know , you say there' s a higher power looking out for me ? </ i>
<i>well , i need him now .
he' s not here . </ i>
jake , what is it ?
i have to go see an old friend .
jacob , why this sudden interest in satan ?
do you think he really exists ?
many in the church take the devil quite literally ... but i think of him as a symbol of temptation , not as a beast with a pitchfork and horns .
what does it say in the bible about possession or self mutilation ?
you think that your two friends were possessed ?
maybe .
<i>" when jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene , he rebuked the evil spirit . </ i> <i> " ' you deaf and mute spirit , ' he said .
' i command you to come out of him . " ' </ i>
again , sorry about your friend .
thanks .
so when did you stop worshipping satan ?
<i>ten years ago .
i' m a christian now . </ i>
<i>it' s more forgiving . </ i>
<i>why' d you even start ? </ i>
<i>some folks want what god ain' t giving them : </ i>
money .
power .
me ?
i wanted to get laid .
<i>there' s more pussy at a black mass than there is at a metallica concert . </ i>
what happens at a black mass ?
people get naked .
then they sacrifice something .
a cat or a dog .
satan rewards you for killing a dog ?
the more you give , the more you get .
what happens if you kill a human ?
my group was more bankers and housewives ...
looking for a different kind of picnic .
do you know any people that are more devoted ?
<i>you don' t cross people who are willing to give up their souls . </ i>
walt , please .
yeah , i know a guy .
just do me a favor .
<i>don' t tell him i sent you . </ i>
coming .
sammy .
<i>mr .
reisz , i' m jake gray . </ i>
i called about an hour ago , said i was coming by .
yeah .
i get $50 an hour for consultations .
right .
i should charge more .
the guy who fixes my car gets $80 .
barely knows where the sparkplugs are , much less how to conjure up beelzebub .
i ever sell books to you before ?
no .
<i>you say it' s called the " pathway " ? </ i>
yes .
why ?
<i>because that' s what we call the connection between the devil and the possessed . </ i>
so how did i resist ?
<i>we' re often unaware of our strength until we' re tested . </ i>
why does the devil need to use computers or games ?
think about it .
<i>it' s a very effective way to spread a message . </ i>
i mean , imagine if hitler had had the internet .
<i>maybe satan' s found someone to do his bidding again . </ i>
<i>i' ve seen this man ... </ i>
in my head .
so have i.
what makes you think this guy can conjure satan ?
because i taught him to .
when aidan kater came to me to learn the black arts ... he was a geek living out of the back of his van .
i stopped teaching a few years later ... but by then he was very skilled .
why did you stop ?
i was going to be a father .
was ?
anne kilton was a student of mine before we were married .
the pregnancy was hard on her .
she had a bad premonition ... and asked me to perform a sacrifice for the health of the baby .
a human sacrifice .
i refused .
so kater took your place .
i came home one night and found a pentagram in my yard .
there was blood everywhere .
<i>" anne must have sacrificed some kind of animal here . " </ i>
but anne was gone , too .
when they found her bloody clothes in a ditch two days later , i knew ...
aidan kater had sacrificed my wife and unborn child .
<i>i' m sorry . </ i>
what did the police say ?
the police were very helpful .
they made me their prime suspect .
<i>i spent the next five years trying to prove that i didn' t do it . </ i>
<i>and that' s what i have left to remember them by . </ i>
an empty grave .
the devil uses the pathway to possess people .
and then forces them to kill ... and commit suicide ?
she seduces them .
<i>the devil' s a woman ? </ i>
<i>i don' t know .
it can be whatever it needs to be . </ i>
or what you want it to be ?
<i>i didn' t want it to be a woman . </ i>
you think conrad and dakota wanted to die like that ?
some part of them did .
<i>you didn' t even know them ! </ i>
<i>i' m not saying it' s your fault .
i think that you' re angry because ... </ i>
<i>yes , i' m angry . </ i>
<i>my friends are dead !
i' m angry ! </ i>
<i>but i' m not crazy .
this kater guy is behind this ... </ i> <i>and i gotta do something .
i can' t just stand here . </ i>
what are you gonna do ?
throw holy water on him ?
burn him at the stake ?
you believed me when i said i saw something .
i did .
i believed that you had a vision , maybe , or an apparition .
the bitch was in my basement !
okay .
you know what ?
this is getting a little bit too heavy for me right now .
i adore you , but this is getting to be too much .
<i>i guess i shouldn' t have come here . </ i>
<i>i' m sorry . </ i>
fucking shit .
<i>we' re not going to be able to save you now . </ i>
<i>you are dust , and to dust you shall return . </ i>
<i>he' s gone to hell . </ i>
where you going with those , jake ?
to your mother and father ?
<i>you can' t do that , man . </ i>
<i>you' il ruin everything . </ i>
jake .
<i>i didn' t have a choice . </ i>
neither of us do .
are we in hell ?
no .
<i>but hell ain' t so bad . </ i>
<i>you' il see . </ i>
you know , you remind me of myself when i was your age .
smart .
angry .
trying desperately to pretend that i was something good ... <i>but somehow deep down inside knowing you' re not . </ i>
<i>i' m nothing like you .
i don' t kill people . </ i>
no , you just dream about it .
is this how you got to conrad and dakota ?
you mess with their minds until they do what you tell them ?
it was a test .
they failed .
you passed .
you stared the devil directly in the face ... and you never looked away .
but when you finally did ... <i>we knew that we' d found you . </ i>
you used the pathway to find me ?
why ?
because you were stolen from us ... and we needed a way to get you back .
stolen ?
by who ?
those people you call your parents .
they found your mother where she was hiding on the night you were born .
she was too weak to fight them .
<i>you' re insane . </ i>
you were taken from your real mother on the night you were born .
my real mother ?
anne kilton .
bullshit .
anne never had a child .
you made sure of that .
every son wants to believe his father ... <i>but faking anne' s death kept ivan from the truth . </ i>
you belong to us .
you always have .
anne had a plan ... but when paul and kathy interfered ... you went from being a prince of darkness ... to just another fucked up kid .
look .
your whole life is a lie .
why are you doing this to me ?
why ?
<i>don' t be afraid . </ i>
<i>she' il explain everything . </ i>
where is she ?
i know who you are now .
why ?
no !
<i>there' s a higher power looking out for you . </ i>
i had to make sure my son still belonged to me .
oh , god .
you had to kill before i could show myself to you .
they took you from me ... <i>but i' m sorry i had to do this to you . </ i>
<i>that isn' t your blood . </ i>
drink this .
accept who you were born to be ... or go back to the life that you hate .
will you be with me ?
<i>i' il be whatever you need me to be . </ i>
<i>you' re a monster . </ i>
<i>my god , they think i killed them ? </ i>
<i>the devil couldn' t kill her child , so this is how she makes me pay ... </ i> <i>for wanting to be human . </ i>
<i>but maybe they' re right . </ i>
<i>maybe there is no pathway . </ i>
<i>and this is all a fantasy i' ve created to live with the horrible things i' d done . </ i>
<i>wake me from this nightmare . </ i>
<i>please .
help me . </ i>
