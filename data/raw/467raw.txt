surveillance cameras ?
we`re pulling the video now .

they know it`s ours .
they`re helping .

that`s the father over there .
gordy , we need to get you on a gurney .

i need to know what you know .

i won`t tell that dad the killer got away due to protocol .
tell him what you want .
we`re done talking until you`re cleared .
excuse me , nurse .
excuse me .
gordon brewer , please .
jack .
how you doing ?
hey , gordy .
how is he ?
could have been worse .
the glass missed his femoral artery by a hair .
he was lucky .
let me say , the full resources of the united states ... ... will be employed to make clear ... ... that we do not tolerate attacks on our city .
that said , we must fiight the temptation ... ... to make hasty policy decisions we may come to regret .
we can`t allow an anonymous criminal ... ... to unravel our partnership with colombia .
who was the specifiic target ?
hey , buddy .
how you doing ?
i won`t speculate .
what will the president do about it ?
he `s meeting with the joint chiefs .
was the state department warned ?
what do we know ?
the president`s coming on soon .
i doubt he`il say anything new .
turner says the bomb was hidden in a police motorcycle .
they don`t know who triggered it .
i saw a cop .
i saw him .
gordy , get back here !
goddamn it !
i saw him .
goddamn it , come here !
slow down !
i saw him .
you`re not going anywhere !
any problems , go through shrub`s office over at state .
that`s right .
yes , he`s one of us .
he can handle it .
ls beckett there ?
or moyers ?
he could help .
skin of his teeth , that guy .
classic agency mold .
get a copy of every visa on a colombian passport .
everyone`s covering up for him .
that`s why they`re called spooks .
bastards .
they must have used some kind of liquid explosive .
lf you`il follow me , sir .
i just want to help .
used to be with bomb and arson .
right this way , sir .
l`il take you to agent phipps .
gordy brewer is here .
the fireman ?
yeah .
says he talked to the cop .
we appreciate you coming down .
we know this guy .
his name is claudio perrini .
we think he`s a terrorist called el lobo .
the wolf .
definitely the guy i bumped into .
i talked to him .
i told him i was picking up my son .
the son of a bitch smiled at me .
the bomb may have been triggered by a cell phone .
did he have one ?
i don`t know .
how long between the time you saw him and the explosion ?
five seconds .
maybe 10 at the most .
that`s enough time to make a call ?
maybe .
this could be tough to watch , sir .
i was late .
they shouldn`t have been there .
they shouldn`t have .
no , the bomber shouldn`t have .
peter brandt , cla , latin american section .
he was one of the targets .
l`m sorry for your loss . lf there`s anything i can do for you ....
i promise , one way or the other , we`il catch that son of a bitch .
how do i get ahold of you ?
we`re not at all separated from one another .
we all run the same course ... ... and will find one another again .
we won`t be apart , for we live for christ .
now , we are united with christ as we go to him .
we shall all be together in christ .
amen .
this is gordy .
anne .
and matthew brewer .
leave us a message .
mr. brewer , my name`s ken barnett with lateline .
we`d love to get you in the studio to hear you tell your story ... ... in your own words .
if that`s something that interests you , please call us at 552 12
now back to rick garcia with more on the bombing in los angeles .
i`m at the state department , where the counter terrorism headquarters ... ... received a videotape from el lobo , or the wolf ... ... a colombian terrorist who is responsible ... ... for at least 7 bombings , including the most recent in los angeles .
on behalfof the people of colombia ... ... i claim responsibility for the bombing in los angeles .
the bombing was an act ofself defense againstamerican war criminals .
as long as america continues its aggression in colombia ... ... we will bring the war home to you .
and you will not feel safe in your own beds .
colombia is not your country .
get out now .
sangre o libertad .
for more , jenniluz in los angeles .
i`m with mr. ortiz dominguez of the latin american solidarity committee ... ... a group sympathetic to the army of colombian liberation .
sir , you`ve characterized the alc as freedom fiighters .
isn`t the bombing herejust a brutal act of terrorism ?
the wolfonly brought to the u. s. what the u. s. has brought to colombia .
the killing ofinnocentpeople like anne and matt brewer is terrorism .
their deaths are regrettable .
it`s called collateral damage .
ortiz , you want the call ?
cnn is holding .
washington post`s on the line .
am i the only one here ?
agent crosby will relieve you soon .
new york times is on one .
put them on hold .
that`s my position .
i already told you this .
why should i change it ?
collateral damage , huh ?
who the fuck are you ?
l`il give you collateral damage .
stop that !
it looks like the fireman .
move in .
go now !
go !
you want collateral ?
right here .
what are you doing ? !
want collateral damage ?
here .
what are you doing ? !
where`s the wolf ? !
i don`t know !
tell me where the wolf is !
put the bat down !
fuck you !
take him down !
i don`t know !
turn it off .
come on .
just relax , mr. brewer .
i have to cuff you .
l`m agent collins with the fbl .
bring your wrist right here , sir .
take it easy .
you`il be all right .
just relax . lt`s gonna be all right .
i can`t imagine what you`re feeling right now ... ... but you can`t take the law into your own hands .
i think you already lost him .
he`s long gone .
otherwise , he wouldn`t have sent you that tape .
am i under arrest ?
no .
we convinced mr. ortiz to drop the charges .
the truth is , we`re pretty sure the wolf is back in colombia .
i find this questioning offensive .
you are the reason this has occurred .
you went to the colombian consulate with a plan to attack the guerrillas .
then they tried to blow you up .
senator , if you intend to argue  mr. brandt , l`m not arguing .
i am telling you , your mission in colombia is terminated immediately .
with all due respect , senator ... ... that is the worst thing you can do now .
this isn`t for discussion .
peace talks are being arranged between colombia and the guerrillas .
this is insane .
you can`t negotiate with terrorists !
these guerrillas don`t want peace .
all they want to do is sell cocaine .
senator , peter brandt has had a great deal of experience
spare me , douglas .
brandt has failed .
all he`s done is bring the war home to american soil .
that is completely unacceptable , and you know it .
you have 72 hours to pull your operatives out of colombia .
have you any questions , mr. brandt ?
none at all .
damn it , pete !
come here !
why call them senate intelligence hearings ?
they`re all imbeciles .
l`m going back to colombia and kill them all .
we`ve been here before .
you know the drill .
this will blow over .
for now you`re being reassigned here to l tag .
you can find this animal , pete .
just do it via satellite .
all right ?
you`re okay .
l`m sick of this crap .
get the plane ready .
we`re leaving tonight .
another guy`s claiming he`s the wolf .
so ?
he asked for you by name .
and he knows unreleased details about the bombing .
take it over here .
who`s this ?
you`re tough to reach .
i tried for the last three weeks .
brewer ?
you`ve been busy finding the man who killed my family ?
right ?
i understand you`re anxious .
we`il keep you posted .
tell me the truth , brandt .
you owe me that much .
you`re not going after him .
the truth ?
the colombian government`s trying to negotiate peace with the guerrillas .
we can`t go in the guerrilla zone .
so bottom line is ... ... justice for your wife and son isn`t a priority .
colonel .
peter , good to see you .
i wasn`t expecting you back .
i won`t hand the country over to a third rate che guevara .
how are my boys ?
they`re dying to get in the field .
on furlough from the psych unit ?
lsn`t this it ?
i need to talk to you .
okay .
gordy , how you doing ?
come in .
meet a friend of mine , ed coonts .
l`m sorry about your loss .
thank you .
ed spent two years as a military adviser down in colombia .
he can help you .
i see you`re doing homework .
well , if i don`t do it , it seems no one else will .
you`d have to be freaking cracked to go there .
you can`t even land in colombia ... ... without a state department stamp on your passport .
you can bet you were on their restricted list ... ... five minutes after that bombing .
oh , yeah .
well , panama .
back door into colombia .
you have been doing some homework .
let`s say you managed to get into the country without getting killed ... ... you`d need a pass to get into the guerrilla zone .
they`re sure not going to give you one .
well , let`s say i got one .
it would take them about two seconds to realize you`re not juan valdez .
and they`d shove your head up your ass ... ... and bowl you off a cliff .
are you going to help me or not ?
tell me your plan .
i`il cross the border through the darien gap .
i understand thejungle is hard to patrol .
i can make it to valencia in one day .
then it`s 200 miles to the guerrilla zone .
i can pay someone to drive me to mompos .
i don`t think so .
approach the wrong person , you`re a dead man .
next to drugs , kidnapping gringos is the mostprofiitable business .
get on a bus as fast as you can .
mompos ?
si .
if you make it to the bus , you`re doing all right .
thanks for your advice .
lt`s only good advice if you take it .
que pasa ?
up ahead .
roadblock .
who are they looking for ?
anyone not like them .
his passport was found in his backpack when he escaped one of our roadblocks .
he`s committing suicide .
upriver or on the road through mompos .
lf we know he`s here , the guerrillas know .
or they will soon .
i want you to make sure of it .
all right .
i give you 1 2 hours before we find your fireman facedown in a pit .
sure would show washington you can`t negotiate with terrorists .
los angeles was a great success .
finally , the hypocrites want to negotiate .
americans hide behind family values .
false ideals .
they`ve forgotten the reality of war .
not like us .
they found his passport .
he`s coming to mompos .
excellent .
take a fireman from los angeles .
when america hears the story , they cry rivers of tears .
capture him .
we hold him for ransom , and they will pay .
two teams .
one at the harbor , one in town .
find him and bring him to me .
lf they don`t pay ... ... we kill him .
all roads end in mompos .
the only way into the guerrilla zone from there is upriver .
how do i go upriver in that ?
no one goes upriver .
not without a pass .
you said i need a pass to get in .
tell me how to get one .
you may be able to buy a pass from a local .
god help you if you ask the wrong one .
look , this is where ipretty much run out ofgood advice .
thanks .
i`m going to fiigure it out .
what are you doing ?
ls the boy okay ?
yeah , he`s okay .
but i don`t need any help .
i was just concerned about the boy .
sorry .
you are very kind .
he gets so excited .
i have trouble keeping up .
he couldn`t wait to get to the festival .
this carnival , he loves .
l`m selena .
gordy .
this is my son , mauro .
gordy .
friend .
all right .
better get going .
nice to meet you .
bye bye .
mr. brewer .
you have to come with me .
you`re on my list .
what`s this about ?
you`re here illegally .
no , l`m not .
my passport was stolen .
see those guys over there ?
they`re guerrillas !
hey , no , seriously , captain .
i appreciate you guys taking me without a reservation .
i know how crowded it gets in here .
you know , l`d tip you , but your chief took all my money already .
you gave away my favorite cell .
put him next to the american .
that`s not nice .
why`d you do that ?
because he`s bigger than i am ?
why are you doing this to me ?
i thought we had an understanding .
you`re calling me a pervert ?
i like you too .
sean armstrong .
public lewdness .
at least , that`s what they call it .
but i was just standing there .
she was doing all the work .
are you just quiet , or did somebody confiscate your tongue ?
gordy brewer .
do i know you ?
i doubt it .
so , what are you innocent of , huh ?
l`m an illegal alien .
you goddamn gringos .
you come down here and steal all the jobs .
half the country wants to kidnap you .
half wants to kill you .
no one gives a shit about us canadians .
death squads kill the guerrillas .
guerrillas kill the military .
peasants are killed by everybody .
but we canadians , flies on the wall .
hey , man .
don`t even look at them unless you can kill them .
they`re all guerrillas , aren`t they ?
i did not say that .
that`s what you meant .
you work the guerrilla zone .
that`s how you know .
can i move to a different cell ?
doing what ?
i fix and sell heavy machinery .
you satisfied ?
sell me a pass so i can work the zone .
stick a sock in it .
l`m just a wrench for hire .
lf anyone found out what i do , l`d be an organ donor .
my pass is not for sale .
thanks a lot .
don`t mention it .
give me a list of everybody they picked up .
the guerrillas were after brewer when the policia showed up .
everyone we need in the same jail .
we should put this fireman on the payroll .
seat belt .
i think we got some company coming .
mompos jail is under attack by guerrilla troops .
get a team outside the jail and two squads to clear the building .
copy .
goddamn it , i can`t believe this shit !
what about the fireman ?
claudio , they`re coming !
we have to go !
let him burn in hell !
shit !
we`re gonna fry !
we`re gonna fucking fry !
that`s using the old noggin !
that`s using the noggin !
yeah !
fuck america !
good .
that`s good , baby .
that`s good !
get me out of here !
let`s play this is your life .
i want your pass .
lt`s my livelihood !
you`d let me die here ?
i thought we were friends !
lt`s my livelihood !
you`d let me die here ?
that`s the last thing that will happen to you .
first , the air`s gonna heat up in here to 451 degrees .
your pass will explode , your socks will ignite , your fingernails will melt .
all right , all right !
shit !
here you go !
lt`s yours , all right ?
take it .
now get me out .
get me out of here , please !
come on !
witnesses heard prisoners call for el lobo .
he was here , boss .
he was into our hands and they let him walk out ?
what good`s a tower if nobody`s watching ?
the fireman isn`t here .
no kidding .
the fireman escaped the fire ?
look around .
with any luck , gordy brewer`s dead .
l`m sorry i had to scare you .
hey , i know when it`s time to retire .
you weren`t gonna let me burn .
what`s this for ?
for your retirement fund .
and for additional information .
tell me what i need to know .
get back to the harbor .
the guy who takes me upriver , his name`s omar .
he`il set you up .
ln san pablo , ask for felix ramirez .
say you`re my replacement .
say that i was arrested for something raunchy .
good luck .
you`il need it .
who did this ?
the guerrillas .
they think these people help the paramilitaries .
put your hands up !
and hold up your pass !
i replace armstrong .
you are not armstrong .
that`s for damn sure .
felix ?
heinrich beckmann , his replacement .
says you , buddy .
this is a serious breach of protocol .
i put in the papers , and this is what i get ?
lt`s like ordering a pizza .
ask for canadian bacon , you get german sausage .
lf you don`t want me to fix your engine , l`il go back home .
come on , come on .
don`t be such a sauerkraut .
what happened to my man armstrong ?
maybe you brained him for his pass .
armstrong was arrested yesterday .
he was caught screwing the police chief`s daughter .
that`s armstrong .
double dipping whore .
i love that guy .
i wish i were him .
i still can`t let him through , felix .
lf my generator isn`t fixed , i can`t pay my taxes .
i can`t pay , your boss will make some cuts .
now , it could be your salary , and it could be your throat .
l`il let you marinate on that , okay ?
bring him back here first thing in the morning .
danke .
beckmann .
don`t forget your pass .
your english is good for a german guy .
thanks .
when did you learn yours ?
oh , man , i been to new york , chicago , miami .
l. a. for a little bit .
i want to go back someday when l`m a big shot .
i can`t be begging some corporate asshole to put my cd on .
i want to cut an album , man .
lt`s kind of hardcore campesino rap .
want to hear a little taste ?
lf i have to .
with that attitude , it won`t be a lot of fun .
here you go .
guerrilla thrilla take me to manila
what do we got ?
smooth like vanilla
hottie , eenie minie mo tell the cla to go
they gotta get out , you know
what do you think , man ?
great .
i think you`il be a winner .
are you serious ?
you`re in the wrong profession .
i can`t believe this .
that`s exactly how i feel .
all right , here .
put this on .
what`s this for ?
for your protection .
you don`t wanna know how to get where we`re going .
it won`t be more than 1 5 minutes .
okay , we`re here , baby .
don`t get funky on me .
peekaboo .
so , what do you think ?
pretty snazzy , right ?
where are we ?
my place .
it smells here .
profits , baby , profits .
this is a cocaine plant .
i know .
just because l`m brown and down doesn`t mean i work for minimum wage .
lf i don`t do it , bolivia will .
bolivia don`t , china will .
lf china don`t , america will do it .
actually , they are doing it .
jesus !
i want to put you in my next video .
lt`s the diesel generator .
i should let it cool down ... ... but it`s drugonomics .
i can`t crank it out fast enough .
those silicon valley geeks must e mail it to each other .
that the one ?
yeah .
armstrong was a magician with that .
don`t worry . l`il make it work .
let`s hope so .
he told me his name was heinrich beckmann .
heinrich beckmann ?
he had a hat on .
i didn`t recognize him .
i made a mistake .
no !
please , claudio !
listen to me , please !
claudio !
ln the struggle for liberation ... ... there is no room for mistakes .
discipline is everything .
discipline and punishment .
find him .
and no mistakes .
come here whenever they want and barge in . l`m not a puppet .
i thought i was paid up for the month .
where`s the mechanic ?
calm down , dog .
you losing faith in me , man ?
i got everything under control .
i got him working his ass off .
germans are like cyborgs .
you seem tense .
need some r and r ?
you got pull , you can get me a new generator .
heinrich , i got some friends for you .
my bad .
i said if he fixed that gasket , he could take five .
he`s probably in the latrine .
he`s probably buffing the helmet .
besides , he can`t blend in .
he`s this big neanderthal
we`il get some rum , we`il hang out
what the hell was that ? !
get the mangueras !
get the pumps !

claudio !
no !
stop !
rest now .
who are you ?
l`m his wife .
get out .
the fireman , huh ?
the coward who kills women and children .
you americans are so naive .
you see a peasant with a gun on the news , you change the channel .
but you never ask , " why does a peasant need a gun ?
why ?
you think you`re the only ones who can fight for independence .
lndependence to do what ?
to kill my wife and my son ?
i remember your face from los angeles .
that was the face of a man who saved lives .
well , your face has changed .
you think your wife and son would recognize you now ?
i remember your face too .
the smile ... ... just before you killed them .
you`re gonna pay for that .
you`re gonna pay for that .
well , it seems we`re both willing to kill for a cause ... ... so what`s the difference between you and l ?
the difference is ... ... l`m just gonna kill you .
estaban !
estaban !
why do you want him alive ?
he saved my life and mauro`s .
what is the purpose ?
he`s the enemy . lf they don`t pay tomorrow , l`il kill him .
claudio , don`t do this .
don`t argue with me .
lt`s not the right way !
don`t tell me what to do !
come back !
this is a satellite photo of san pablo last night .
we got a large heat and light anomaly consistent with an explosion .
two minutes later , building blows up .
we got guerrillas , some down .
we have a big man down on the street , a woman and child .
and this guy .
this guy gives the orders .
i can`t believe it .
brewer found the son of a bitch .
a little later , an alc convoy arrives .
everyone loads up .
they travel two minutes upriver .
they stop here .
an alc base camp .
we`il insert a platoon here .
use air support to box in the rear .
we`il come in through the treetops .
only 20 minutes .
washington will know .
we got a wounded american being tortured .
this is a rescue mission .
we go in at dawn .
roger that .
why are you taking care of me ?
because you saved my son .
and your husband killed mine .
when i first met claudio , he was a teacher .
it was in guatemala .
sophia , our daughter , was born there .
the guerrillas were all around us , but they left us alone .
one night , soldiers came to our village .
they were led by american advisors .
we crawled into the fields , but they threw grenades .
sophia , our baby girl ... ... she was hit .
she bled to death in claudio`s arms .
mauro was orphaned that night , so i took him in .
claudio joined the guerrillas .
and now he`s a man consumed by hate and driven by rage .
just like you .
l`m not like him .
not yet .
what about you ? lf you keep working with him , you are no better than him .
what would you have me do ?
help me stop him .
lt`s too late .
l`m trusting you with my life .
and my son`s .
what are you saying ?
claudio went to washington to plant a bomb .
i can`t be a part of it anymore .
they`il protect us , won`t they ?
