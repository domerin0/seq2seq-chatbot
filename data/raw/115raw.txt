he is very distinguished .
totally .
i wonder how much he' s worth ?
quickly .
there are 2 intruders in your office .
block all the exits .

the question is not who it was , but who gave the order .
don' t do it
do you have him ?
we must go .
bring the dragon to safety we let them run for a while .
see you at the meeting
our lifes will change , tsu .
thank you for coming .
we know eachother from stories of others .
everybody does his thing .
we can make our sport public together .

bangkok , nothing beats that .
asia .
why not ?
what is this about ?
a gym for young people of the street . come on .
sorry .
my little son is waiting for me i' ve got nothing against exoticism .
i' il help .
it' s on the way .
instead of spreading out we are going to thailand together .
about these things you should never think so much
come .
this is cool , leo
when does the training start ?
we should do something like that overhere .
this is gonna be great , guys .
it' s magical
you have a paradise here you really feel like home .
i became worried
do you have it ?
show me i dont have it .
i left it where it belongs we' re sorry we wasted your time .
you turn to someone else .
no wait , she is still young .
don' t listen , master .
let us show you our loyalty
by crawling for him ?
we beg you to accept our apologies .
this theft should humiliate mr. wong for the final strike .
then i would rule the city you owe me one .
watch out .
kitano , you know our rules
our members dont marry outsiders
i know .
because i love a chinese .
i will be punished and chased away ...
like an ordinary servant
but i swear , misawa , that i will return as a master .
i give my family her lost honour back .
if you fail , you will lose a lot more .
you will lose your life .
and above all , your wife .
i can also succeed .
i can take over the lion section of wong' s empire .
i am his son in law .
if he likes it or not .
watch out for kien and tsu .
they can betray you .
they are chinese themselves .
it wouldn' t take a lot of effort for them .
they are hungry .
they will go until the end .
yeah , mate .
i want chicken
i dont want your sausage .
no , the entire chicken the chicken that i see there . boc boc boc .
it' s for the three of us .
no , that' s meat .
i dont want that i want the entire chicken .
rice , chicken .
that chicken there .
easy .
i said easy .
be calm .
no one is reacting .
nevermind .
if i watch , i' m an accessory control yourself .
come with me .
very good .
that was amazing .
i know someone that will be happy
come on , guys .
dont be afraid
so , that' s better eh ?
i hear you are going to your grandfather yeah , i intended to go .
has it been long since you saw him ?
i dont know him .
perhaps that' s why i' m a bit scared
he will be happy to see you .
i hope so .
our mixed blood will always be a problem .
only the yakuza offer us a future .
why you want to destroy everything so close to the target ?
we' ve made a mistake , kien .
from the beginning .
my little sister that knows and understands everything .
someday the triads will kill us for what we have done .
and if they dont do it , kitano will .
you are wrong .
he needs us .
she didn' t make sacrifices to let us become criminals .
because of her blood the triads have banned us . as ordinary strangers
tell me what she has left us ... other than sadness and fear to live .
she' s dead , kien .
she didn' t abandon us , she' s dead .
i will always be there for you .
anyone wants to excersize ?
i dont trust it .
we try it .
ok , lets go
look out !
that' s to dangerous .
i wont let them go now .
hey frenchman weren' t we clear enough ?
leo , do you know them ?
triangle
to understand your violent behaviour ...
you must always put yourself in the place of the person you are going to hit .
let' s get out of here .
bangkok is a battlefield .
it' s not a playground .
come .
thanks for your help .
you are here on his territory .
why ? we didn' t want to fight .
we just wanted to excersize excersize ?
he' s not allowed to see us together .
go away , or he' il kill you all
you should have warned us .
i didn' t expect this .
when i came there they wanted to scare me off .
but if you give in , you dont have a life .
i thought i was done with it .
which is not the case .
we have played with our lives .
sorry , but i' m not going to give up my gym .
the day when your agression will dominate you ... it will be too late .
what are you going to do ?
put my thoughts in order .
if you want to stay , you are welcome . thank you .
i' ve to go too .
and you ?
i' m going home .
i' ve been gone too long .
let' s spend the night here .
tomorrow we take a morningflight .

i didn' t find the right one yet .
different than others .
kien ?
come on in .
any idea on what we are going to do ?
i dont travel thousands of kilometers just to fight in bangkok .
that' s not for me anymore .
i should have asked her .
ik had het haar moeten vragen . who ? the small asian ?
she' s on the wrong side .
i dont want to judge her so soon .
have you already forgotten what happened ?
i know
she only brings troubles .
forget about her .
kenjee , dont ruin your life .
he' s not worth it .
no .
cut it out , kenjee .
no
what are you doing here ?
i didn' t mean it .
leave me alone .
can' t we talk ?
what are you afraid of ?
you came looking for me .
go away .
please .
daddy .
my boy .
i' m glad to receive you here with me in my house .
i' m only here to make my daughter happy .
it is good to reconcile our families and cultures with eachother .
our ways are too different .
you will never understand that .
an old rule of our triad says i will never be able to trust you .
kitano .
i' m sorry .
i' ve to go .
thank you for this second chance .
wong has been waiting long for someone to follow him up .
this kidnapping is breaking his heart .
i will not disappoint you now .
i' il be right back .
are you crazy ?
not today , guys .
come back tomorrow .
they got away good . ze kwamen goed weg .
do you want to trump them ?
it is tempting .
what ?
i wont be part of it .
yaguy , come for a second
he is right , he' s a father .
but i' m in .
otherwise i can forget about my gym
we take him to the airport and tackle them .
alright , but quickly .
take me with you ...
there she is .
there .
tsu , kien wants to talk to you .
tell him he solves it by himself do it yourself .
that idiot still doesn' t understand .
mind your own business .
hurry .
this way .
come with me
trust me .
your grandfather knew that you would come
he has told me so much about you that i know you better than yourself .
you have taken a long way .
thank you for seeing me .
your grandfather would have been proud if he knew you would be amongst his people .
i should have come much sooner .
he' s still here , you know .
his spirit still waits for you .
this temple is his residence he has not left it .
he' s here and there .
everywhere at once
he' s in the trees .
he' s in the wind .
he' s in you
they will never find us here .
i want an explanation
what do you want with my life story ?
maybe i want to stay then
you wont understand anyway we shall see .
he took care for me when i was small .
without him i would be dead .
i can' t just abandon him .
what is he to you ?
my brother .
let me help you then .
wong has been waiting long for someone to follow him up .
this kidnapping is breaking his heart .
kitano was very serious .
we can also do it without her .
but what did she do with him ?
can' t she see that he is dangerous ?
you always think too much it is time for deeds .
thinking ahead prevent mistakes .
tell that to your sister .
it' s her fault that it came this far .
after the kidnapping kitano will take us into his group .
it will be a massacre .
kitano will give us the chance to make up for our mistake .
this is our last chance . this time we wont let him down .
this is not the moment to be weak .
why aren' t you there ?
we must talk .
you want to talk ?
about what ?
about wong' s son ?
dont do it .
there is another solution .
logan will help us .
you do it your way , i do it mine .
everything that will happen will be your fault .
kien .
i must stop him .
i must warn someone .
think about what i' ve said .
wait for me .
i will come for you .
trust me .
this is there hiding place .
after the first troubles i followed them .
they wont stop until it' s settled .
hey you , do you remember us ?
we' il get them later .
we dont have time now .
dammit .
you only had to block the road .
yeah , i went a bit too far .
run !
yaguy , you blew it .
we have to go .
let' s go seperate .
we' il see eachother upstairs .
this way .
you wont get me .
what are you doing here ?
you started it we just hit back .
it was a big mistake to come here .
this will cost you .
you talk too much .
if you really wanted to kill me , you would have done it a long time ago .
let' s get out of here .
we should never have trusted you .
you are no better than your sister .
the yakuza and the triads will take a bet on who is going to kill us first .
from now on it' s each on his own .
we have no alternative .
the sister of kien is here .
kitano had ordered her to steal your family seal ... and kidnap your son tonight .
with this you will not erase the insult towards me .
but perhaps it will save your life and the live of your son .
do you think we are that weak ?
in a war no one is save .
even you .
i dont want to see you in this city anymore .
but before you disappear you have to do something for me .
mae , i put someone on .
she' s going to tell you something about your husband .
yes .
still nothing ?
still nothing .
mae just left .
i dont know where to .
i' m sorry ... my friend .
you can go .
what happens next ... only concerns me .
kien and tsu have betrayed us .
with the french they want to prevent the kidnapping .
dammit .
i cannot abandon him .
kien ?
did you deal with your ghosts ?
we have to leave here .
you have found her .
where are they coming from ?
logan .
our new master wants me to let you live .
for now .
no .
he appreciates your worthy help .
but the yakuza tolerate no traitors .
go and see if everything is ready .
i' m sorry .
my friends are in danger .
i' ve to go .
the road to them brings you closer to your grandfather .
you are always welcome here , son of the wind .
why did you follow us that evening ?
what did you do to my friend ?
why do you care ?
it' s your fault .
you owe me an explanation .
dont say that .
dat mag je niet zeggen .
are you going to hit me , like your brother ?
he only wanted to help you and now he' s dead .
master , it' s him .
your sister and her friend are impatient .
and we got one of the french .
where and when ?
twelve o' clock at the industrial grounds .
if the door opens i' il kill you .
where are you going ?
if you leave from the wind , you will leave from the life .
dont be afraid .
let the wind take you to us .
hold on .
how are you feeling ?
what happened ?
logan , where is kenjee ?
that' s not where he came for
it' s true .
now we are even .
they have my sister and your friend .
who is he talking about ?
the yakuza
by attacking us you have messed with their plan .
now they want your life and mine .
do what you want , but i' m going with him
not all of us will not return alive .
so dont feel obligated to come .
we are in this together .
they are in the west wing .
and you ?
i have a meeting .
where is she ?
safe .
for now .
what did you expect ?
where is the other ?
you are brave .
but your sister will be dead .
no .
friends will take care of her .
kenjee , everything okay ?
no .
what' s wrong ?
he' s happy to see you .
you' ve betrayed the love of my daughter ...
now you must face the consequences .
i' m glad you are here .
you have insulted us and you will pay .
we have come here to defend our honour .
if you kill him , you will become one of us , kien
that' s what you wanted , isn' t it ?
here' s the exit .
wait a second .
we' re not going to leave her brother .
dont do it or you will become like them .
master .
it' s over .
there are too many of them .
my death will do .
i hope they will spare you .
tell my wife i love her .
in a few minutes the police will come .
that' s enough time for you to follow your master in shame and blood .
our master showed us the road .
if we sacrifice our blood in battle , we wipe his honour clean .
prepare for battle .
do we fight or run ?
fight .
over the roofs .
no .
armed men are everywhere there .
you must conquer the security of your victory without fearing the defeat .
as long as you fight with dignity , you win .
you dont fight against others , but against yourself unite both our arts and control your violent temper .
then the road will open itself for you .
no .
come .
no .
do you realize what we just did ?
imagine yourself .
yaguy , we were almost dead let it decant for a bit .
stay .
do it for me .
i can' t .
men , from now on , we stay together we stay together , h ?
you must live your life and i live mine .
we never change .
run , you will never get him .
i' ve had a dream .
the wind floated me to you .
do you remember ?
hey love birds , what' s up with that meeting ?
which meeting ?
be patient .
