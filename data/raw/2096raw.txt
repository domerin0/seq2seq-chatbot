lin , wake up .
little sister !
get up !
lin , it ' s late .
let me sleep a bit more .
no way .
today is mum' s memorial .
you have to help big sisters in the kitchen .
remember yesterday when we were in cha ca street ?
it was crowded .
and i had a weird feeling .
what ?
i thought that people mistook us for a couple .
haven' t you ever noticed that ?
no .
ln fact ... maybe that ' s how people always see us .
knock it off .
go wash up .
let ' s go , big brother .
hurry up , i' m starving .
sit opposite me .
let me sit next to you ... so we see the same things .
you' re horrible .
you never do what i want .
we look good together , right ?
don' t talk rubbish .
what for ?
we were made for each other .
everyone knows you' re my sister .
better think about what to buy with big sisters instead .
i don' t decide what we' re eating .
it ' s always the traditional dishes .
exactly .
so don' t forget anything .
i' m sick of running to the market for two lemons .
probably a couple of shallots .
what ?
nothing .
khanh , do i throw out the seeds ?
no , cook the rice with it , it will be nicer .
and the pt ?
one inch or two ?
let ' s see .
too thick .
one inch is fine .
agreed .
lin , those shallots shoots ?
my god , i forgot .
kin could buy some .
let your husband be .
writers only know about the human soul .
he can' t tell shallots from chives .
but my husband , he knows his plants .
you' re right .
you should send hai , he' d love to do it .
okay , if the elders are chatting , i' il send little brother .
i photographed this fruit in hu .
i' il spare you its scientific name .
it ' s eaten with pickled prawns .
you only find it in hu .
hai !
go buy some shallots !
lin says you love the market .
yes , that ' s right .
kin , can i take your bike ?
ls the caf open ?
no , only from six o' clock .
auntie mai , bring me two trays .
yes , right away .
quc , the other day you said that apart from business ... you take photos for yourself .
why don' t you show them ?
i' d really like to see them .
i' m not happy with them .
i say that because , in your photos for the botanical society ... there are no faces .
and in your personal photos there are ?
yes , of course .
they are mostly portraits .
but i think photos of plants give me greater pleasure .
ln them , there is a tranquility you can' t find in a face .
it ' s tranquility i look for in a photograph .
i think i get you .
but all the same , in my opinion ... you have a real problem with faces .
i will demonstrate that your opinion is a writer' s fantasy .
this is my favorite part .
it ' s strange .
satisfying and disgusting at the same time .
it ' s true .
we women are condemned to disgusting things .
ln the old days , we couldn' t touch a man' s head .
that noble part of the body must not be soiled by our hands . but men have always liked and allowed us ... ... to touch another thing .
exactly .
so is that thing considered noble ?
we must conclude that it isn' t since we' re allowed to touch it .
it must be classified as disgusting .
i don' t find it so very disgusting .
on the contrary .
what do you mean ?
oh , well ... you could call it a culinary fantasy .
what ?
listen , i always thought that ... fried with a little garlic , it must have an amazing texture .
both tender and crunchy .
it ' s not easy to talk about a photo point blank .
i' d accept that excuse from anyone ... but not from a writer .
words are your business .
you exaggerate .
are you open , quc ?
oh , hello , kin .
come in , ton .
lin will make you a coffee .
no , i just came to say hello .
so , kin , when is your first novel coming out ?
oh , there' s no hurry .
i' m working on it .
but it ' s going well ?
ln fact , i' m nearly finished .
there' s little left to write , but i' m blocked .
it ' s about an encounter .
usually , that happens at the beginning or in the middle .
but here , it ' s at the end .
the protagonist meets a woman .
i want to write it concisely and end abruptly .
i can' t wait to read it .
big brother ton .
big sister lin .
an iced coffee ?
make up your minds , you two , it ' s getting ridiculous .
she calls you " big brother " and you call her " big sister " .
it can' t be .
it ' s actually absurd .
what ' s the problem ?
we were born the same day .
what time were you born ?
that ' s it , i don' t know .
i know when i was , but it doesn' t help .
nobody knows at home ?
no , nobody .
sorry , i have to help my sisters in the kitchen .
lf you find a solution let me know ... and i' il stick to it .
look , here' s how i see it .
she already calls you " big brother " .
call her " little sister " like husbands and wives do .
who says i want to marry her ?
just look at you .
what are you talking about ?
the boy wants to marry our sister in law .
oh , yeah ?
easy as a pie .
betel leaves and arec nuts for the engagement ... then a wedding 6 months later .
but first he must learn to say " little sister lin " .
okay , stop teasing me .
where have you been , little mouse ?
i went for a walk and i' m going to see mommy .
gorgeous .
not a crack in the skin .
let ' s decorate the altar for the ceremony .
the incense is burnt .
let ' s carve the chicken .
taste this wine , uncle .
what luck !
i was afraid you couldn' t make it .
the memorial meal is a success .
we' re hopeless .
we should' ve learned with our mother .
not at all .
you' re almost as good as she was .
uncle tung hasn' t aged , has he ?
want some water ?
hai , want some ?
i ate too much , didn' t you ?
yes .
me too .
i don' t think i' il eat tonight .
me neither .
what would you say to some snails in ginger ?
now , that i could eat .
me too , come to think of it .
good , that ' s settled .
shall we continue ?
start with the registry office .
so i was saying that kin became more and more interested ... as he discovered new clues .
after examining the register and putting aside the unlikely ones ... he arrived at the theory that mother' s ton ... was a certain phan chu ton .
they were at the same school for 5 years , which supports his theory .
then it must be that ton .
why only 5 years ?
because ton died of starvation in ' 43 during the japanese occupation .
mommy was 14 then .
so it was a schoolgirl crush ?
hang on , it ' s a theory , not a certainty .
kin hasn' t checked with this ton' s family yet .
they moved to saigon in ' 54 .
he' il have to go to saigon .
and be lucky enough to find a relative ... who may have got wind of this love story .
it can only be this ton .
i say that because according to this theory ... it ' s a case of puppy love .
at the end , when mum wasn' t all there ... and mistook dad for ton , she was reliving her childhood .
that ' s why she spoke to him like a shy little girl .
she told him that she loved him so innocently ... that it brought tears to dad' s eyes .
like i said , this is only a theory .
and i tell you that kin' s research will confirm what i believe .
it can' t be otherwise .
it ' s obvious .
me , too ...
i believe this version of the story .
our mother could never have loved any man ... but daddy .
i know in my heart that she was faithful .
i' m sure of it .
dad and mum were always together , they were inseparable .
the proof is that a month after mum died ... he followed her .
there' s something perfect about their relationship .
and remember what we' ve said a thousand times .
mum was one month older than dad .
he died one month after her ... which means that they lived almost the same lifetime ... give or take an hour ... by our reckoning .
poor daddy .
i wonder how much he suffered .
lf he had known that ton was a crush , it would have been different .
we should ask kin to stop looking .
what to you think ?
lin' s right .
he must stop .
he' il be disappointed .
here come the snails .
bring us some napkins .
please , suong .
lin , ton wants something .
i' il go see .
ton has the worst name on earth .
i find guc so proper , so perfect , he' s almost bland .
it ' s as if every desire had deserted his body .
some live out their fantasies .
others , like me , are content to write about them .
but quc is 1oo % fantasy free .
not an ounce of imagination .
anyway , suong told me that she' s not satisfied .
how do you mean ?
you know .
i' m not surprised .
don' t show off .
you' ve got work to do in that department .
how annoying .
you moved it .
should i put it back ?
absolutely not !
just when did you get in my bed ?
ln the middle of the night , i was cold .
nest time , i' il chuck you on the floor .
you know you' d never do that .
because of you , i fell out of bed this morning .
forgive me , big brother .
it ' s not nice to fall off of bed .
oh , poor you ...
what do you want to eat ?
sticky rice ?
excuse me ?
two portions for my brother and one for me .
daddy' s going away .
he' il be back in a few days .
see daddy over there ?
when is quc coming back ?
ln two weeks .
the radio says it will rain .
what do you think ?
yes , it looks like it .
little mouse !
i gave an errand this afternoon , i' il be back around 5 o' clock .
i' m pregnant .
ls that right ?
are you sure ?
it ' s strange .
all of a sudden , i' m exhausted .
i think i' il take a nap .
you go sleep .
i' il wake you up for lunch .
you' re white as a sheet .
remember the last time i was like this ?
yes , when i said i would marry you .
have you told your sisters ?
not yet .
it ' s our secret .
let ' s keep it for a month or two , okay ?
mum , can i draw ?
yes , go ahead .
where ?
on the wall , if you want .
lin ...
yes ?
i' m going out now .
i' il be back around 5 o' clock .
okay .
little mouse , come here .
i want us to talk .
i can' t take it anymore .
this vow of silence ...
i can' t stand it anymore .
we meet again .
we love each other without a word .
i know nothing of your life now .
i miss the days when all we did was talk .
lf you don' t speak , i' il go crazy .
i can' t stop looking at your lips .
have you noticed ?
i want to see them move .
you want to tell me something ?
lf ... you ... speak ... one ... more ... time ... we ... won' t ... see ... each ... other ... ever ... again .
you' re serious ?
okay .
i' il stop talking .
but give in just once .
i want you to say my name .
tun .
say it .
tun .
ls that the thirteenth shot ?
yes .
nhn , want some water ?
yes , please .
i could do with some food .
there' s nothing to eat .
are they biting ?
big brother hai ... turn off the alarm .
what about you ?
i' m smoking because it ' s raining .
ln fact , i don' t really smoke .
the new painting , is it vu' s self portrait ?
this place is turning into a museum .
i fell out of bed again .
oh , poor you .
ln the middle of the night .
i didn' t hear you get up this morning .
makes sense .
i slept in your bed .
oh , so that ' s why .
you took up all the room in my bed .
i had to sleep in yours .
i' m sorry .
will you do my nails ?
bring me the file and clippers .
good thing that it ' s raining .
i have a scene in the rain tonight .
what type of part ?
the usual .
a bit part that they edit out .
don' t be silly .
i' m not being silly .
this will be my 17th film .
17 tiny parts that nobody notices .
stop feeling sorry for yourself and tell me what happens instead .
okay .
here goes ...
i' m the heroine' s one night stand .
i' m a mistake in her life .
a meaningless affair for her .
nothing but the memory of a farewell in the rain .
that ' s the scene we' re shooting tonight .
a parting in the rain ?
i know ...
don' t tell me you' ve seen it a hundred times .
that would be true .
no .
it ' s lovely a farewell in the rain .
you think so ?
yes , i mean it .
i really think so .
i want to play the scene with you .
i haven' t finished your nails .
it doesn' t matter .
we' il do it later .
so you' re my one night stand .
a mistake in my life .
so , what are my lines ?
you don' t say anything .
and you ?
i don' t speak either .
there' s no dialogue .
then what does it say in the script ?
you have your back to me , you look ahead of you .
no , you look down .
i pull you by the arm , you turn around and we look at each other .
okay .
wait .
i' m ready .
i' m ready .
i' m hungry .
the rain gives me a taste for boiled sweet potatoes .
you know ...
i' m having trouble ending my novel .
finding out about your mother' s ton would do me good .
it would take me away from the book ... so i' d return with a fresh outlook .
i think it ' s a good idea .
what do you say ?
i' il only be in saigon for a week .
your nails are too long .
i' il cut them for you .
don' t worry .
mi and auntie mai will manage .
but there are a lot of customers in the caf .
i told mi to call if she needs help .
it ' s getting in my eyes .
i' ve finished your nails .
little mouse , do you want some ch ?
yes , some ch .
what are you doing in the rain ?
looking for ho .
have you seen him ?
he wasn' t in the class .
did you try his place ?
yes .
and caf quynh ?
he could be there .
thanks . ls caf quynh that way ?
i' il take you .
ah , ninh .
hello .
lin .
how are you ?
i' m looking for ho .
want to come in ?
i' m too wet .
have you seen ho ?
did you try his place ?
yes , an hour ago .
with this rain , if you don' t find him at his place ... ... you should go home .
thanks ... but i' il wait outside his place .
you never know .
bye .
bye .
did lin leave ?
she' s still downstairs .
listen , ho , i' m warning you , i won' t help you anymore .
i think it stinks .
lin doesn' t deserve it .
what did she do to you ?
i don' t know .
just a feeling .
i' m older than she is .
but she seems more mature than me .
i still don' t follow you .
you' re my best friend .
i' m not ashamed to tell you .
i think she dominates me .
you' re an idiot !
just now , i asked lin to come in .
luckily , she refused .
ho heard you were waiting here .
he' s busy , he can' t make it .
he' il meet you tomorrow .
three o' clock at the caf quynh .
thanks , nghia .
three o' clock tomorrow , then .
that ' s right .
bye , lin .
yes , thanks .
let ' s go , lin .
hai , let ' s go this way .
give me some .
dream on !
hai , look .
you didn' t believe me .
they think we' re a couple .
big brother , i' m so sleepy .
we' il go home when it lets up .
that ' s lucky !
cyclo !
no one lives here ?
no , not a soul .
this place would suit me .
not me , it ' s too sad .
i don' t think so .
one should live where one' s soul is in harmony .
where it is in accord with its surroundings .
harmony can sometimes be a consolation .
i didn' t realize you were so unhappy .
i know that living here isn' t the solution .
right now , i' m torn between two places ... that pull me with equal force .
lf i choose one place ... even temporarily ...
i feel guilty toward the other one .
with time , a guilty conscience ... turns into sadness .
i' m sorry that i can' t help you .
what do you do when sadness overwhelms you ?
i go down to the village to look for a woman and i snuggle up to her .
one of them is sweet and she likes me a lot .
when i' m sad i send for her ... and i lie down beside her .
that warm , damp flesh ... those soft hairs ...
all of a sudden ... a terrible pain crosses my chest .
then i thank heaven and i fall asleep .
lf i have the bad luck to wake in the night ... and find her at my side ... the sadness i feel then , nothing can make it go away .
filght vn 183 from hanol ... to ho chl mlnh city .
filght tlme ls one hour and 45 mlnutes .
we wlsh you a pleasant filght .
this is bui kim ngn .
did you reserve room 324 for me ?
thank you .
excuse me .
daddy !
daddy !
don' t move a muscle .
i' m going back to hanoi tomorrow .
i must speak to suong .
are you sure it ' s the right thing to do ?
i don' t know , but i must .
i don' t want to stop you .
for four years ...
i' ve held my breath .
both here and in hanoi .
the burden on your heart ...
i' m afraid of losing the moments when we are together .
i must speak to suong .
then leave tomorrow .
but don' t promise me anything .
i' il wait for you .
lf you come back ... it will make me happy .
kin !
hin ?
it ' s been ages !
big sister ... can i ask you a question ?
yes .
it ' s very important to me .
so please answer even if it ' s an indiscreet question .
okay , go ahead .
has the ... idea of cheating on quc ever crossed your mind ?
why do you ask me that ?
just because .
i was wondering under what circumstances the thought might arise .
does it bother you to answer ?
does it ?
no ... it doesn' t bother me .
the idea of cheating on quc occurred to me once .
it all started 4 years ago ... or 2 years after we married .
i can tell you now .
i was two months pregnant .
only quc knew .
we decided ... to keep it a secret ... and only to tell you when i was in my third month .
that ' s why you never knew .
quc was away on business , and i miscarried .
he came home immediately .
and something in him had changed .
it was as if his life were on hold .
i couldn' t get through to him .
and our marriage suffered .
later , after little mouse was born ... the situation hadn' t improved .
that ' s just when ... he appeared .
it was one morning ... very early .
as soon as he entered the caf , i felt a fondness for him .
it was a pleasure to wait on him .
i told myself ... that i wanted him to love me .
and then ?
and then , we met elsewhere .
he told me he loved me .
and it was true .
did you and he have a thing together ?
no , obviously not .
a few kisses .
a few cuddles , that ' s all .
that ' s all .
what do you mean ?
he went back to saigon .
he was a businessman .
he came to hanoi ... to set up a branch office .
when the work was done , he left ... because i told him ... that our relationship had no future .
do you still think about him ?
yes .
his name was tun .
right ... let ' s go to sleep .
thank you , big sister .
this time , you got into my bed .
you lie .
you got into mine first .
i had to take yours .
and then you came back .
that ' s how it happened .
i don' t remember a thing .
i remember too well .
sometimes i wonder if it isn' t time you got married .
i' m not kidding .
you' re old enough .
it ' s not a bad idea .
first of all , i' d have to find a man .
my ideal would be someone like you ... because you' re good like dad .
you really think i' m like him ?
yes , of course .
i know you too well .
the problem is to find someone who is like you .
but what will you do once i' m married ?
who' il wash your clothes ?
who' il make your meals ?
lf that ' s what worries you , i' il manage .
i' il do even better than that .
at least i won' t have to look at your stained panties ... next to my clean shirts when you have your period .
so ungrateful !
you' re horrid !
baboon face !
come and dance with me .
suong , quc is back .
he' s upstairs .
i' il go up .
can you manage ?
yes , khan will help me .
go ahead .
quc is upstairs .
i know .
lin told me .
have you been back long ?
half an hour .
do you want something to eat ?
no .
lin gave me some fruit .
i wasn' t expecting you for four more days .
what ' s going on ?
you' re back ?
what are you doing ?
i' m washing up and going up to bed .
i' m knackered .
did you work late , last night ?
worse than that .
i worked until dawn .
i put away my pen and went to the airport .
oh , poor darling !
do you like to kiss me ?
so , you finished your novel ?
that ' s wonderful !
you' ve been stuck for two months .
and , presto ...
ln two days , it ' s done !
the protagonist meets a woman ?
did you end it in 17 pages as planned ?
19 .
still very close to your estimate .
you are a real genius !
not necessarily , i haven' t re read it .
maybe when it ' s edited it will be 17 pages .
show off !
go rest .
when you wake up , there will be good things to eat .
have you forgotten to tell me anything ?
hin called me .
she told me everything .
what you ate , what you drank ... what you talked about .
i' m very annoyed .
why ?
it appears that you talked about the good old days .
but that ' s not why i' m mad at you .
i' m mad because you told hin that i' m pregnant ... when we agreed that it would be our secret .
forgive me , i was tactless .
it ' s okay .
go to sleep .
i' m going to tell my sisters in a little while .
we' ve talked all night .
i' ve told you everything .
i' m going back soon to finish my work .
i want to know what you' ve decided .
for a long time ...
i' ve known you had a child with another woman .
i went through your things and it was easy to figure out .
ln the photos you brought back from your trips ...
i watched the child grow up as if i had raised him .
ln everything you' ve said ... the only thing that matters to me ... is that you can' t love me anymore because of your dishonesty .
i' m not asking you to give up this woman and your son .
i know ... that you love them as much as us .
ln a few days , when you return , we' il start our life again .
here' s what i hope for .
i am your wife .
i expect you to love me better than you have loved me .
i want you to be the man i knew ... before we were married .
that ' s all .
khanh , can you help me ?
yes , i' m just back from the market .
i wanted to tell you ...
i' m pregnant .
how' s that ?
i' m pregnant .
i forbid you to smile !
it ' s serious , you know .
whose it is ?
i won' t play guessing games with you .
say it !
whose is it ?
his name won' t mean anything to you .
you don' t know him .
he' s married with kids , is that it ?
what does he do ?
studies architecture .
he knows you' re pregnant ?
yes .
i just told him .
unmarried and pregnant !
when the baby arrives , what will you two do ?
me and my baby ?
who said anything about the baby ?
he' s not born yet !
i meant the other one .
we haven' t decided anything .
which means what , exactly ?
why don' t you say something ?
talk some sense into her !
khanh ... don' t cry .
i' m happy , you know .
i know it might look terrible to you .
but i' m confident ... everything' s going to be okay .
khanh , instead of blubbering , reason with her .
what am i supposed to say when i' m pregnant myself ?
and i suspect that kin cheated on me in saigon .
enough !
i' m through crying .
khanh , how do you know you' re pregnant ?
what ' s that ?
how can you tell when you' re pregnant ?
so what makes you think you are ?
because ... two weeks ago ... he and i ... we did ...
was it the first time ?
yes , and the only one .
so what did you do ?
well , first , he put ...
what did he do ?
he kind of put ...
what ?
i don' t know how to say it .
right , that ' s it .
tell me .
when you had your last period ?
a week ago .
tell me if i' ve got this straight .
two weeks ago , you and he did something .
and a week ago , you got your period ?
yes .
good lord !
so , does that mean i' m pregnant ?
what an idiot !
it ' s not complicated !
this girl is really thick !
we' re going to have fun .
today , my sisters and i are doing everything ourselves .
the memorial dishes and the meal for 3o guests .
quc and kin will lend a hand .
you' re excused for reasons of incompetence .
why is the anniversary of a death so important ?
we didn' t celebrate dad' s birthday while he lived .
it was the same for mum .
oh , it ' s your birthday .
and that was all .
