diane !
i' m looking for my girlfriend .
i' ve got a picture i took today .
she' s wearing this .
yes , i did see her .
when ?
half hour ago .
she was over by the lotto machine .
was she alone ?
did she talk to anyone ?
you know how many people pass through here ?
no cutting in line !
my girlfriend' s disappeared .
has anyone seen her ?
please .
anybody ?
we pulled in , we got gas .
we then parked in that space .
she came into the store .
that' s when she disappeared .
did you fight recently ?
wasn' t a fight .
it was a thing .
a thing ?
don' t you have a girlfriend ?
yeah , and if i think something' s just a thing ... ... you can bet she' il think it' s a fight .
i' il make a report , but give it 24 hours ...
no , listen to me !
she has disappeared !
something happened to her .
it' s not a lovers ' quarrel .
i urge you to move your face back to where it was .
now , i know you' re upset .
if i get information indicating foul play , i' il proceed .
but for now , you better go home .
that' s it ?
i' ve had him in my class .
he' s a complete failure .
i know , but probably not a total lost cause .
please , i just ...
look , he put up a new one .
i heard him on the radio .
every month he replaces the posters .
every 30 days .
you can set your watch .
he must' ve loved her very much .
i do admire his perseverance .
night of the living dead .
i' il get him .
no , this is your second double this week .

mel gibson doesn' t call .
i know that guy .

rita , bring me those checks .
my friend disappeared between mount st. helens and seattle .
that' s about 60 miles from here .
i know .
what does your friend look like ?
i know this is really crazy , but i think ...
if i remembered everyone who came in , i' d be a freak of nature .
she' s beautiful .
yeah , i know .
what' s your name ?
jeff .
shit !
don' t worry about it .
it' s okay .
i' m not letting you get into a car like this .
there' s a nice , big cot in the back .
let me sit for a minute ...
you can' t drive like this .
you should be in bed .
i' il be all right .
what do you do now ?
i was a copywriter , but i lost my job .
i' m sorry .
no .
no , i' m writing a novel .
i couldn' t do that if i was still one .
why don' t you take my number ?
don' t give it to strangers .
i slept with you , at least in the same room .
that bed killed my back .
give me your arm .
turn around .
what are you doing ?
just relax , here .
did it crack ?
is it better ?
i gotta clear more space .
look what i found .
why don' t you talk about her anymore ?
she was the no .
1 topic .
what' s the point ?
to get upset ?
to wind up all frustrated ?
it' s weird how things just fade away .
it' s not faded .
your stuff is in the top drawer .
what' s in those boxes ?
more crossword puzzles ?
those aren' t crossword puzzles .
they' re anagrams .
oh , anagrams .
that' s really important .
it' s mostly old stuff .
just high school yearbooks .
really ?
where ?
i wanna see .
now ?
we have some unfinished business .
don' t go through my stuff .
rita !
you okay ?
no .
what is this ?
it almost killed me .
it' s nothing .
it' s for protection .
there' s a lot of psychos around .
it' s loaded .
that' s usually what psychos respond to , honey .
why didn' t you tell me we have a gun ?
you just moved in .
you also have to bang on the faucet .
let' s get one thing straight , okay ?
no secrets , jeff .
in the heart , on the lips .
rita , i need it .
fine .
thank you .
come on .
no more secrets , i promise , okay ?
one night when you' re asleep , i' m going to chuck that gun .
i' m sorry .

i need to talk to you .
hello ?
arthur .

i' m sorry , jeff .
i' m afraid it' s not for us .
but it' s very good .
very talented .
i see .
don' t look so destroyed .
we' d like you to write something else for us .
like an assignment ?
exactly .
that would be great .
i remember when your girlfriend' s disappearance was in the news .
that was terrible .
i was in tacoma at a wedding , and i saw your posters .
i' d forgotten all about it , but you' re still looking .
yes , i am .
i want your story , jeff .

what do you say ?
i' ve ...
i' ve been trying to put that behind me .

welcome to channel 7 news check .
i' m paul mcgraw .

welcome to our show .
thank you .
in the years diane' s been missing , any new clues ?
have the kidnappers made any contact ?
no , not at all .
and yet here you sit , year after year , trying to find her .
at least to find out what happened .
that must' ve cost a lot of money .
pretty much everything i have .
let' s just say the kidnapper is watching .
anything you' d like to say to him now ?
i want to meet you .
i don ' t hate you .
i just wanna know what happened to her .
i' m prepared to do anything to find out .
please .
i need to know .
there .
measure on the bench .
goggles .
don' t you value your eyes ?
all right , gather around , please .
the greatest risk the research chemist faces ... ... is that a contaminant is introduced ... ... into the experiment ... ... without his knowledge , rendering the experiment pointless .
rita baker .
once upon a time , in a wood , there lived a finch named kiki .
with her raccoon friends , pop and reba ... ... she went to find the source of the river .
a children' s book .
lulu the alligator .

oh , my god !
room service .
open up .
the guy at the desk said you' re here .
is this what you want ?
take it off .
why ?
i believe in giving my man what he wants .
you know what ?
call me diane .
i' il treat you like shit .
then i' il disappear !
take it off !
oh , my god !
no secrets ?
remember , jeff ?
no secrets !
i knew i could never make you understand .
who are you ?
you tell me the truth !
did you know what you were doing when you went ... ... from crying to waking up in a sweat from dreaming about her ?
mentioning her less and taking her picture off the night table ... ... and putting mine there ?
dancing on the balcony ?
was the whole thing planned just to throw me off ?
i didn' t wanna lose you !
you' re still in love with her !
i' m in love with you .
what are you saying ?
i may not be as smart as you , but i' m not a dumb bitch .
look at this room !
no pictures except for the posters !
no mementos , just this !
i love you , rita !
i cracked the code , jeff .
i saw the book .
you' re a liar .
i tried not to come .
i almost went back home ... ... but if i did , i' d just pack up and go .
why didn' t you ?
because i don' t know how not to fight .
nobody in my family ever fought for anything .
they wound up on prozac and sleeping all day ... ... or dead from liver disease at 35 .
that' s not gonna happen to me , jeff .
i fight !
it' s not her , rita .
it hasn' t been for a very long time .
then what is it ?
it' s it .
it' s not knowing .
you know what i do ?
i pretend i have a choice .
either to let her go on living wherever she is ... ... and never know what happened ... ... or she can be dead , and i get to find out everything .
so i let her die .
i swear to god , i wish she were dead .
you don' t know what it is like to not know .
shit .
i' m sorry .
but i don' t know what to do .
i do .
i haven' t been to the gas station since .
i sent the manager posters .
he put them up .
i never went back myself .
then it' s time you did .
come on .
till death do us part .
she' s gone , jeff .
gone .
you may never find out how or why .
you have to accept that .
if diane were here right now ... ... i' d ask you to marry me .
it' s you i love , i swear .
but if it were possible to choose right now ... ... i' d rather be back at this gas station ... ... so i' d find out what happened .
it' s not good enough .
if you ever wanna move on with your life ... ... if you wanna be just alive again ... ... then this is your last chance .
i love you ... ... but you must decide to be with me , or i' m gone .
let her go , jeff .
let her go .
diane .
meet me alone ... ... at the yacht club .
hey .
read it .
go on .
come on .
he' s watching me .
i can feel it .
my fear was that he was dead .
but there are things in this letter only he could know .
jeff , he' s seen your picture in the paper .
he wants to see how far you' il go .
he' s loving this .
no , look .
he signed it .
barney .
you think that' s his real name ?
that' s not the point .
you' re right .
the point is , what am i doing here ?
it' s never gonna change .
it' il just go on until you end up as crazy .
this letter' s the first break i' ve had .
i can nail this fucker !
go to the police !
you can' t do this on your own !
the police ?
they laugh at me .
i' m a joke to them .
i' m starting to see their point .
don' t do this to me , not now !
jesus christ , you are amazing !
did it occur to you that she doesn' t wanna be found ?
goodbye , jeff .
run like a coward .
at least diane was taken by force .
i am not diane !
you' ve reached jeff harriman and his twisted ego .
rita baker no longer lives here .
she' s left jeff .
she' s moving out , and she will not be found here again .
so don' t look for me , forever .
you reached jeff harriman and jeff' s twisted ego .
rita baker no longer lives here .
she has left jeff .
rita !
rita ?
oh , shit .
hi , you' ve reached 555 8767 .
please leave a message .
hello , jeff .
i' m the man you' re looking for .
i' m barney .
son of a bitch !
what did you do with her ?
where is she ?
what did you do with her ?
tell me !
where is she , barney ?
kill me if you want .
you have every right .
beat me to a bloody pulp .
but if i die , you' il never know .
i' m sorry .
were you done ?
tell me where she is !
there' s only one way for you to find out .
how ?
one .
how ?
come with me .
where ?
in my car for a drive .
to where ?
diane ?
come with me .
tell me , is she dead ?
i' m offering you this one chance ... ... to find out everything .
i warn you , i' ve taken precautions .
if anything happens to me , or if you speak to anyone ... ... you' il never know what happened .
i' m leaving now ... ... with or without you .
i' il go with you , but you take me to diane !
shit !
he' d be such a great guy .
if he wasn' t monumentally fucked up .
lynn , come here , come here .
i hope he hasn' t changed it .
listen to the message .
you' ve reached ...
he changed it .
leave him a message !
wait a minute .
hello , jeff .
what ?
i' m who you' re looking for .
oh , my god !
i' m barney .
what ?
oh , my god !
hungry ?
i hope you like roast beef .
i' ve thought a lot about meeting you .
i' ve wanted to right from the start .
did you rape her ?
i' m not a rapist .
it' s important that you understand that .
then what did you do to her ?
let me tell you a story .
when i was 15 , it was an ordinary day ...
i don' t wanna hear your damn story .
i couldn' t give a shit .
i wanna know what happened to her .
then you' il want to listen to the story .
you want to listen carefully .
sometimes the devil is in the details .
now , once , when i was 15 ... ... it was an ordinary day ... ... with my ordinary home and my ordinary life .
something willed me to the edge of the balcony .
i wondered if i had the courage to jump .
i kept waiting for something to stop me .
anything .
but nothing did .
and so i jumped .
everybody has had that thought at one time , but i did it .
why ?
because you' re a nut case .
i wanna know where diane is !
you' re still not listening .
be careful .
the answer will slip by you .
go on .
i lead a very normal life .
i work .
i have a home .
but then , one day ... ... on vacation with my family in california ...
there' s a little girl in the water !
hurry !
she' s drowning !
wow !
i jumped in without thinking , just like when i was 15 .
once again , nothing stopped me .
i didn ' t want to save her .
i wanted to be a hero for my daughter .
you' re the bravest man in the world .
i love you , daddy .
in that moment , she thought i was a god .
that would make most people feel great , but i panicked .
what does this have to do with diane ?
diane was an experiment .
saving a life made me a hero , but did it make me a good person ?
i had to prove to myself beyond a doubt ... ... that i was as capable of evil as i was of heroism .
real evil .
the worst thing .
or i wouldn' t deserve my daughter' s love .
you' re fucking insane .
you killed diane .
for me , to kill is not the worst thing that i could imagine .
there' s more to know .
tell me what happened .
i won' t say a word .
you won' t because if you do you won' t get what you need .
something wrong , officer ?
you have a broken taillight .
i don' t know what to say .
there' s nothing criminal on the tape .
we' il conduct a search , but he has to be missing 24 hours first .
twenty four hours ?
jesus !
what is this ?
gotta give out parking tickets first ?
lynn , please .
how much have you had to drink ?
one after another .
get that taillight fixed .
yes , officer .
will do .
thank you .
drive safely .
problem ?
your seat belt .
i' m claustrophobic .
just put it on .
yes , sir .
miss carmichael ?
it' s rita !
are you there ?
please come to the door !
i need to talk to you !
magically delicious .
miss carmichael !
can you come to the door ?
what' s the ruckus ?
you' re gonna wake elvis .
great .
miss carmichael , this is very important .
did you see jeff here today ?
did you see anything unusual ?
you mean the fight with barney ?
yes !
what fight ?
tell me about it .
nothing to tell .
your boyfriend was whopping that man' s head ... ... got in the car with him and drove off .
oh , god !
okay , what else ?
do you remember anything else ?
yes , come to think of it , i do .
something odd .
what ?
in the middle of everything ... ... that leprechaun popped off my lucky charms box ... ... and started dancing around .
magically delicious !
thank you .
if you wanna know the license plate number of the car , let me know .
wait , wait , wait .
it' s very urgent .
please !
i' il be one minute .
one minute .
please ?
thanks .
sir !
sir , my car was stolen .
your car was stolen ?
the license plate is 155iny .
i' ve already been to the police .
mrs. cousins ?
helene cousins ?
yes ...
you may still have my old address .
1804 northwest everett drive .
seattle .
new one .
thanks .
you gotta fill out this form .
i was having no success .
my methods needed to be rethought .
and then ... ... my family gave me a little party on my birthday .
okay , move in .
right , little closer .
smile !
happy birthday .
happy birthday , barney .
blow out the candles , daddy .
thank you .
forever .
more ?
i' m afraid to open it .
let' s see .
what happened to me ?
what happened , daddy ?
you fell off the balcony .
and that' s when it dawned on me .
it wasn ' t the lure that had to be stronger .
i had to be weaker .
excuse me .
i' ve opened mine with a barrette a million times .
this way ?
yes .
bless you .
excuse me .
i have to go to the men' s room .
i don' t feel so well .
i' d given up for the day .
it was comical .
i didn' t trust myself not to laugh the next time .
fate , jeff .
if i hadn ' t sneezed ...
i' m sorry .
quite all right .
i was just wondering if you had five singles .
three ones .
just a normal single you could trade me for my mangled one .
thank you .
could you ... ?
sorry .
thank you .
okay , now let' s see if this works .
this is your lucky day .
i can feel it .
thank you .
that' s a beautiful bracelet .
thank you .
that' s the symbol for infinity .
i suppose it means it' il stay forever .
well , it' s a nice thought .
my boyfriend would really appreciate something like that .
where' d you get that ?
i rep them .
i handle sales for the whole northwest territory .
wow !
if you promise not to tell the next time you' re in paris ... ... i' il let you have a sample for cost .
they' re in my car .
really ?
with a new product ... ... it' s a good idea to have people seen wearing it around town .
twenty two bucks .
that' s cheap .
if i told you the markup we get for these , you' d die .
you want one ?
yes .
right this way .
there they are .
please .
they' re called " tiles " in french ?
that' s the name of the company .
teels .
un tile infinity , please .
could you get in and give me a hand ?
get in ?
yes .
why did you make contact with me ?
because you asked .
the way you searched for diane .
such a worthy opponent .
a kindred spirit .
you don' t meet many men who refuse to give up or be dominated .
most just crouch frightened in the dark .
excuse me .
i' m looking for mr. cousins .
i saw you come out of his house .
i know who you are .
you do ?
yeah , i saw him watching you this afternoon ... ... at the restaurant .
come in out of the damp .
i' m rita .
i' m denise .
are you going to run away together ?
um ...
it' s complicated .
where is he now ?
at the cabin .
the cabin ?
i forgot .
don' t you wanna be together forever ?
that' s the symbol for infinity .
i gave it to him on a bracelet for his birthday .
look , i wanna go to him now .
but i' m not sure i can find my way .
it' s dark .
can you tell me the way ?
come on .
you can drop me off on the way .
i' m meeting a boy .
daddy has no idea .
mother' s asleep .
daddy says romance has to be secret .
you won' t tell him , will you ?
no , i won' t tell him .
i wanna know what you did with her .
i' il tell you .
i will keep my promise .
but there' s only one way to do it .
you must experience what she experienced .
what do you mean ?
everything that happened to her , every event from this point on ... ... you must duplicate exactly .
you' re crazy .
if you do , logic dictates you' il find her .
alive ?
this coffee is drugged .
judging from your size ... ... it would take 15 minutes to take effect .
it' il put you out for 40 minutes or so ... ... the same length of time diane was out .
you must remain unconscious for us to move on .
so she' s not dead ?
drink .
and afterwards , what ?
drink and you will experience exactly what she experienced .
you don' t understand .
i won' t tell anyone .
i just want to know .
i understand .
and when i put myself in your place , i believe you .
that' s why i don' t need a gun .
your obsession is my weapon .
it' s like you are my laboratory rat .
i provided the materials .
you' ve built the cage .
only now , you can' t escape what you' ve constructed .
if you want to know what happened to her ... ... you have to go through the same things .
the key chain , i' d like to see it again .
jeff , look at your life .
you have nothing .
no job .
no money .
no love .
no peace of mind .
it' s been three years of hell .
at what point do you say , " i' m not going to be over this " ?
there were nights with diane i' d pray she' d get into an accident ... ... just so she' d let me take care of her .
just so she' d have to stay with me .
you don' t care if she' s alive or dead .
i do .
you' re afraid that you won' t know who you are .
who is jeff if he' s not the guy looking for diane ?
please .
can you walk away from knowing the answer ?
please , i just wanna know what happened to her .
drink , jeff , really .
what choice do you have ?
i said i' d show you what happened to diane ... ... and i' m a man of my word .
no !
help !
diane .
oh , shit !
hello , rita .
i really dislike surprises .
rita ?
it' s me !
come out .
you can' t possibly win .
you don' t know how .
your hiding is pointless .
i know these woods inside and out .
they' re like a maze .
you must come out if you want to find jeff !
that' s why you came , after all .
where' s jeff ?
where ?
do what you want .
you' il never know what happened .
if anything happens to me , all you' il have is your same uncertainty .
your choice .
i' il take my chances .
jeff ? !
jeff !
jeff , are you here ?
jeff !
jeff !
jeff !
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
operator 319 .
what city , please ?
hello ?
hello ?
feeling strange ?
this is silly , rita .
you can' t fight .
no !
how did you follow us ?
did you see us leave ?
the important thing is that it was all jeff' s choice .
coming to the restaurant , getting in the car ... ... drinking the coffee .
he did what he wanted to do .
you' re feeling better , aren' t you ?
i know how long the chloroform effects last .
you' il soon be strong enough to fight .
well , i' m sorry , but ... ... i' m just not up to it .
and besides ... ... i have to get home before my wife wakes up .
tell me what you did to jeff .
you took your chances .
is he dead ?
i made him a cup of coffee .
it was drugged .
to find out what happened , he had to go through what she did .
and now you must do the same .
this can be easy , or this can be hard .
your choice .
don' t worry .
it won' t keep you up .
tell me , mr. cousins .
have you spoken to your daughter tonight ?
what ?
how do you know my name ?
i know your family' s names , barney .
wife , helene .
daughter , denise .
sweet , innocent , 13 year old daughter , denise .
brown hair , full of secrets .
i' ve got her .
what are you up to ?
how were you able to follow us ?
denise knows the way .
i took your daughter tonight to trade for jeff .
a brave attempt , but we both know it' s not true .
let' s talk about the mistress she wants you to have .
wuthering heights .
or better yet , let' s talk about infinity .
helene , it' s me .
is denise with you ?
her bed hasn ' t been slept in .
i got up to close the windows and she wasn ' t there ...
that' s right , shithead .
where is she ?
what did you do with her ?
if you wanna know , you' il have to go through what she did .
drink .
you can' t be serious .
try me .
lf you think ...

to your health .
jeff !
god , hold on !
jeff , hold on !

it' s over .
it' s over .
you all right ?
there was a terrific story there before , but now ... ... i think it' s an out and out smash .
i need for you to write it .
i don' t think so .
we wanna put the whole thing behind us .
look , i know i' m being gauche , but i' m a publisher .

you won' t regret it .
what do you say ?
no coffee .
we don' t drink that anymore .
