just 6 years ago the homcide rate in this country has reach acadamic proportion
it seems only a miracle could stop the blood shed .

the pre coptives .

he' d been waiting for me in the car . " " ... he was going to rape me .
i was going to be stabbed ... " " ... right here
within a year .
pre crime affectively stopped the murders
in our nation capital .
in the 6 years , we' ve been conducting our experiment .
there hasn' t been a single murder .
and now pre crime can work for you .
pre crimes , it' s works ... lt' s works ...

pre crimes it works .

the gentlemen of justice wants to take away all these from us .
we got to vote
whether or not noble enterprise .
to change what this country might stand
i understand .
john , watch danny witcrow .
yes .
i met him yesterday .
if there' s any problem , make sure we know about it first .
when the pre crime declared the victim of the killer the name is benicate
in the grain of wood .
each piece is unique to the shape and grain is unique
the shape and the grain
it' s possible to forge .
i' m sure you all understand the lead of precrime
here we go again .
let' s not kid ourselves .
we are arresting an individual who has broken no law .
but they will .
the comission of the crime itself is absolutely physic
if the pre cops can' t see the future .
and they never will .
is not the future to stop .
yes , it is .
why did you catch that ?
because it was going to fall .
it didn' t fall .
you caught it .
the fact is you prevented from happening
doesn' t change the fact it was going to happen
someone is intended to kill broston' s wife .
but they never looked through it .
how can precrime tell the different ?
precrime is intended to and only what you will do .
no sources of suicide .
because it nature of murder .
there is nothing more distracted to the phsycial fabric that binds us
cinommon, she developed pre crime system .
speaking interfact do wants you to say hello .
to cinommon ?
no . to them .
you' ve never been inside ?
it keeps strict operation .
no one get accused of it
i' il be the first one to go in .
maybe you didn' t hear me .
is a question of authority .
there is no question .
i have a warrant in my pocket , is said different .
show it to me .
sure .
there has been an investigation pre crime personnel has been conducted
by an elected supervision .
an expressed of the united states .
and here the representatives , which mean you are under my supervision
when we' re all ready , let' s go .
not cleared for access .
i. d approved .
danny suggested we' re getting some question .
i can' t
just ask some question , and we will get the hell out of here ...
shhh ... they' re sleeping .
sorry
tell me how all this works .
they are in the nutrient supply .
the conductor distinguish
the female agatha .
the twins are arthur and dash
in another word ,
we see what they see .
they can' t feel any pain .
they can drift off to the deepest sleep .
they can' t be kept too awake either .
the science are most of the miracle .
in a way , they give us hope .
hope the existence of the vibe find the identify of the pre cops
pre cop has a recognition that' s all .
you called it the temple . ls just a nick name you know the power in it ?
the power always been with the priest .
even if they have to invent the miracle .
you don' t know what danny talking about .
the way we worked , changing destiny
i mean more like clarity then cops .
jag .
go to work , all of you .
sorry , is has been 3 years in the force since i' ve been a cop .
my father was very proud .
what it is taken you chosen to do my work .
i don' t know .
he was shot and killed when i was 15
no one know what' s it like to lose someone close , john
of course nothing is like the lost of a child .
i don' t have any child of my own so i can only imagine what it been like
to lose your son , in a public place like that .
if me and you had the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn' t happen .
tell me what exactly you' re looking for
fraud .
there hasn' t been a murder in 6 years
there is nothing wrong with the system .
it is perfect , i agree .
is there a fraud , is human
it always is .
john .
john !
what the hell happened ?
they can see the future .
what did you do to them ?
she grabbed me .
grab you ?
is impossible .
you know all they see is the future .
it could have been a nightmare .
what did she say ?
can you see it ?
are you the receptionist ?
yes sir , i am gillan .
you are chief anderton ...
the music relaxes the prisoner .
i' m not in trouble am i ?
yes , i want to see the murders
not too many in here for that one .
the victim is called kate , female .
ls it about the justice department ?
told me to wore a tie .
like this one .
stop .
pull back ...
there .
she' s one of the oldies .
one of our first .
probably before your times .
this is all the three pre cops ?
that' s right , my datas based all three prevision .
my god .
i never seen anything like it .
they' il out there killing people
if it wasn' t for you .
look at how peaceful they all seem .
but on the inside , ... busy , busy , busy .
now that is one bad man , he drowned the woman ann lively in the lake
the killer is john dough , never idenified .
why is he still john dough ?
why he hasn' t got any i. d from the scan ?
i can' t have it from his eyes .
he swapped out to fool the scanners .
you can get it done on the street for few thousand bucks these days .
so you just want just the female pre vision .
we don' t seem to have her data .
try it again .
this is odd .
we have 2 pre visions .
is probably just a glint .
tell me the intended victim ann lively .
look likes she was an heroin addict .
like the john dough here .
it show the address of the clinic .
i thought she cleaned up ?
i think glint comes in two .
finally crawl the way out of one hole
just to fall in another .
no .
i can' t let you take that out of here , chief .
is against the rules .
is anything in here that' s against the rule ?
careful chief , you dig out the past .
all you get is dirty .
the pre vision what ?
fussy or something ?
the pre vision agatha ... wasn' t there .
my wife found a cure for the common cold right now .

i' m afraid that would be the vine for illegal climbing over my walls
the true down vine of course is harvested in my own design
of course something
once the posion get into your blood stream
you will start to see , no need for me to describe .
no extraordinary display .
blue object .
is just isn' t your relieve chief anderton
you better drink this .
so you won' t be able to swallow .
and you' il be totally buggered
just ... what it is that i can do for you ?
you can tell me how someone can fake a pre vision
how will i know that ? because you invented pre crime
what' s so funny ?
the consequences of the series of genetic mistakes and science
gone hay wired called in invention yes .
i prevented pre crime .
you don' t seem all that proud .
i' m not .
i was trying to heal them .
and i turned them into something else .
heal who ?
the innocent we use to stop the guilty .
you' re talking about the pre cops .
you think the 3 in the tank out of the test tube .
they' re nearly the one who survived
i was doing genetic research in a clinic .
to do children and drug addicts .
this was 10 years ago when now it first hit the street
it was the impure form of the drug .
not the engineerer cocktail ...
it became so popular educated .
all these kids were born ...
with severe brain damage . must died before the age of 12 . the pressure who survived they had a gift .
they called it a gift but is like more of a cosmic joke
they wake up in the night .
curled up in the corner of the room screaming .
they dreamt the murder over and over 1after the other
and they didn' t take long to realise the real nightmare was a so called dream
about to come true these murders were actually happening
you say some of the children died ?
many of them .
despite of what we did for them
or maybe because of what we did to them . it doesn' t matter .
is a prefect system now isn' t it ?
i am not gonna committe murder .
i never met the man i' m supposed to kill .
and a chain of events are started .
how can you avoid a man you never met ?
so you won' t help me ?
i can' t help you do it .
but pre cops are never wrong .
not occasionally .
they do disagree .
what ?
most of the time a few pre coptive will see an event
in the same way .
in a while most will see thing differently from the other two .
jesus chris , why didn' t i know that .
because this minority report are destroyed .
instanely occur .
why ?
obviously for pre crime to function
they can' t have suggestion of validity
after all the one who suggested the system has doubt
i' m saying every so often those refuse a pre crime might have an utimate future
does burgess know about this ?
about this minority report ?
i used to joked with lamar , his mother and father
answer my question .
does lamar burgess know about the minority report ?
yes , of course .
he knew
at a time he felt , we both felt he existence was insignificant .
insignifcant to you maybe .
what about the people i put away ?
your system will collapse .
i believe in the system .
do you really ?
you are without a doubt .
without a doubt if your man used to kill your victim
alright , that will be the most spectacular public display of pre crime
it didn' t work .
i didn' t kill anyone .
hold that thought .
why should i trust you ?
you shouldn' t .
you shouldn' t trust anyone .
certainly not the attorney general who wants all by himself . or the young federal or agent who wants your job
not even the old man just to hang on to what he created .
don' t trust anyone .
just find the minority report !
didn' t you say the minority report was destroyed ?
the record was destroyed .
the orginal report still exist
i designed the system .
so when ever i report in , it will be stored in a safe place
what' s the safe place is that ?
the safest place ...
where ?
inside the pre cop .
you protected it .
go to the temple , somehow
and down blow this minority report .
if you had one .
and then walked out ?
actually i think you have to run out
yes , that is what you have to do .
you' re insane .
what do you think i am ?
a dozen times before i get within 10 miles of pre crime headquarter
sometime in order to see the light .
you have to risk the dark .
you' re a policeman . ... you' re a formal policeman
i' m sure you know the people who can help you out
is funny how all these are alike .
the unit chip are down when the pressure is on .
every creature on earth is interested in 1thing .
and 1thing only .
is unsurvivable .
find the minority report .
i don' t even know which one has it .
which one is it ?
the female ...
there are 3 mens in the room .
the victim is here .
john is here .
this unidentified male at the window
the building suggest public housing i can' t make out the location
he won' t go down and kill crow for another 22 hours .
excuse me , this is too private in space you can' t sit in his chair .
he' s not here anymore .
he will come back
in the mean time , he' s smart enough not to go to electric bill board
why won' t he just run ?
because he think he' s innocent .
we concentrate on the sprawl .
and get 2 teams on the ground .
where is she ?
this damn cold .
don' t worry .
you see i can open your chest
and saw a dead cat in there and you will never leave you an infection
you don' t understand i can' t just give you virus .
please don' t touch
what was that ?
it' s anaesthesia
you sneak up on your patient again ?
please , relax .
i just want to tell you .
i need to remove your eyes completely .
i need to replace it with a new one .
my mother gave it to me .
your money .
let me introduce my gorgeous assistant
this is no longer money .
what do you say ?
oh yes , we do .
from where ?
all the way back .
i was a plastic surgent
mostly women .
you set your patient on fire .
change the subject , shall we ?
the future is much more interesting than the past don' t you think ?
she always have eyes for you .
i know what you' re thinking john .
i did spent and awful lot of time in the prison' s libary
i find the education a real ... eye opener .
that was a lot of fun , thank you so very much john .
you gave me the opportunity to get to know my self so much better
i will return the favour .
