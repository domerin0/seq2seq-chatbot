read between the lines !
dewey , man , i hope this doesn' t come between us .
like , i care about you , man .
you guys , you know what ?

you' ve been focused so hard on making it , you forgot about one thing .
it' s called the music .
and i don' t even care .
you know what ?
so what .
i don' t wanna hang out with wannabe corporate sellouts .
i' m gonna form my own band .
we' re gonna start a revolution .
and you' re gonna be a funny little footnote on my epic ass .
i feel sorry for you guys .

no , he' s not here .
could you take a message for me ?
yeah .
hi .
my name' s rosalie mullins .
i' m the principal at horace green prep .
we' re having a little emergency .
one of our teachers broke her leg this morning , and all of our subs are already working .
pat wickam at milton prep recommended i call mr. schneebly .
do you know if he' s available ?
how long is the gig ?
excuse me ?
how long is the job ?
as much as a few weeks , but we need somebody to start immediately .
so how much are we talking here ?
we pay our substitutes 650 a week .
now , do you know when mr. schneebly will be back ?
hold on a sec .
oh , you know what ?
i think he' s just coming in right ...
ned , phone !
hello , this is ned schneebly .
pat faxed me your resume .
it' s very impressive .
we' ve never been in a bind like this before , so thank you so much .
so how' s this gonna work ?
are you gonna pay me upfront ?
i don' t understand .
it' d be really great if i could get paid in cash .
oh , well , we don' t do that .
when you cut my check , make it payable to dewey finn , for tax reasons .
you can discuss all of that with candace at the end of the day .
when' s the end of the day ?
we commence at 8 : 1 5 , school lets out at 3 .
you know what ?
do you think i could cut out a little early today ?
i got some stuff i gotta do .
it' s cool .
i can stay .
mr. schneebly ... ... this is considered the best elementary school in the state , and we maintain that by adhering to a strict code of conduct , faculty included .
don' t worry about me .
i' m a hard ass .
if a kid gets out of line , i got no problem smacking him .
no , no .
we don' t use corporal punishment here .
ok , so just verbal abuse ?
if you have any problems with any students , send them to me .
i will do the disciplining .
check .
children .
please take your seats .
i' d like to introduce miss dunham' s substitute .
this is mr. schneebly .
why don' t you write your name on the board .
yes , i will .
you know what ?
why don' t you all just call me " mr. s " .
mr. s has never taught here at horace green , so i want you all to be on your best behavior .
so the curriculum is on the desk .
and do you have any questions ?
yeah , when' s lunch ?
the children just had their lunch .
is there anything else you need ?
i' m a teacher .
all i need are minds for molding .
all right , then .
well , thanks again .
you saved the day .
ok , who' s got food in here ?
you' re not gonna get in trouble .
i' m hungry .
you .
what do you got ?
that' s what i' m talking about .
ok .
teach .
teach .
teach .
all right , look , here' s the deal .
i' ve got a hangover .
who knows what that means ?
doesn' t that mean you' re drunk ?
no .
it means i was drunk yesterday .
it means you' re an alcoholic .
wrong .
you wouldn' t come to work hung over unless you were .
dude , you got a disease .
what' s your name ?
freddy jones .
freddy jones , shut up .
shut up .
the point is , you all can just chill today .
we' il start on this crapola tomorrow .
yes , tinkerbell ?
summer .
as class factotum , first i' d like to just say , welcome to horace green .
thank you .
any questions about our schedule ?
because usually now miss dunham teaches vocabulary , then gives us a pop quiz , then splits us up into reading groups .
track b is ...
ok , hey , hey , hey .
miss " dumbum " ain' t your teacher today , i am .
and i got a headache and the runs .
so i say , time for recess .
but mr. s , that poster charts everyone' s performance .
we get stars when we master the material covered .
how do we get gold stars if we just have recess ?
what are these black dots here ?
demerits .
what kind of a sick school is this ?
as long as i' m here , there will be no grades or gold stars or demerits .
we' re gonna have recess all the time .
but miss dunham only gives us recess for 1 5 minutes ...
you' re not hearing me , girl .
i' m in charge now , ok ?
and i say recess .
go .
play and have fun , now .
nice .
now , you don' t want me to have to call your parents , do you ?
it' s all right , emily , don' t cry .
just try to be a bit more conscientious .
would you like a hug ?
i' il be good , i swear !
all right , well , that' s fine , emily .
you' re excused .
yes , we did it .
we did it , come on .
give me some .
give me some .
give me some .
give me some of that .
i will see you cats on the flip flop .
later !
i heard she slipped in the bathroom .
yes , but we' ve got a wonderful new substitute who comes very highly recommended .
mr. schneebly ?
mr. schneebly ?
yeah !
hold on , buddy !
oh , my god .
you' ve gotta be kidding me .
oh , man , this guy sucks , man .
here , call him .
call him ?
yeah , right .
ok .
yes , you can be in my band .
but , ned , no power plays , man .
i' ve got vision up the butt , so just go with it .
no , thanks .
you' re not a teacher , ned .
you' re the cross dressing , blood sucking incubus from maggot death .
that' s the real you .
dewey , i' m not a satanic sex god anymore .
i' m a working stiff .
and that' s cool .
she' s got you brainwashed .
i' m working .
that' s terrific .
but who are you , babe ?
this is my apartment , babe .
not if you don' t pay your rent , it' s not .
get a job .
i got a job .
i' il have rent by the end of the week .
go tell the mayor .
you got a job .
doing what ?
i do what ned does , temping .
i' m not a temp .
i' m a sub .
and soon i' il be a certified teacher .
come on , man !
one show , $20, 000 prize , we split it 60/ 40 .
grab your bass and come back to the garage .
i mean , don' t you miss rocking out ?
if you think anyone is gonna be in a band with you , you' re more delusional than i thought .
dewey , you know , maybe it' s time to give up those dreams .
i did , and things are going really great for me .
are you gonna teach us anything or are we just gonna sit here ?
just do whatever you want .
i want to learn from my teacher .
besides that .
freddy , what do you like to do ?
i don' t know , burn stuff ?
just go out and have recess .
my parents don' t spend $1 5, 000 a year for recess .
you want to learn something ?
yes , i do .
you want me to teach you something ?
all right , here' s a useful lesson for you .
give up .
just quit .
because in this life , you can' t win .
yeah , you can try , but in the end , you' re just gonna lose , bigtime , because the world is run by the man .
who ?
the man .
oh , you don' t know the man ?
well , he' s everywhere .
in the white house , down the hall .
miss mullins , she' s the man .
and the man ruined the ozone , and he' s burning down the amazon , and he kidnapped shamu and put her in a chlorine tank .
there used to be a way to stick it to the man .
it was called rock ' n ' roll .
but guess what .
oh , no .
the man ruined that too with a little thing called mtv !
so don' t waste your time trying to make anything cool or pure or awesome .
the man' s just gonna call you a fat , washed up loser and crush your soul .
so do yourselves a favor and just give up !
mr. schneebly , it' s after 1 0 .
on tuesdays , the children have music class now .
right .
ok .
good work , people .
we will continue with our lecture on the man when we return .

i thought you didn' t believe in grades .
of course i believe in grades .
i was testing you .
you passed .
good work , summer .
four and a half stars for you .
now , listen , normal kids would have been stoked to slack off , but not you guys , because you' re not normal .
you' re special .
because you guys have the right attitude ,
i think it' s time we started our new class project .
a science project ?
no .
it' s called ... " rock band " .
is this a school project ?
yes .
and it' s a requirement .
it may sound easy , but nothing could be harder .
it will test your head and your mind and your brain too .
will other schools be competing ?
you could say that .
you could say that every school in the state will be competing for the top prize .
what' s the prize ?
a win will go on your permanent record .
hello , harvard , yo .
we' re not supposed to get started until next quarter , but i think we should get a leg up on the competition , don' t you ?
i do .
who else wants to go for the gold ?
i do .
all right .
but if anyone finds out , we' il be disqualified .
so let' s just keep it on the down low , shall we ?
can we tell our parents ?
no !
trust me .
they don' t want to know .
keep it zipped .
all right , you guys , let' s kick it into overdrive .
what are the rest of us supposed to do ?
you just sit back and enjoy the magic of rock .
you mean we' re not in the band ?
now , hold up now .
just because you' re not in the band doesn' t mean you' re not in the band .
we need backup singers .

why do you say you' re not cool ?
nobody ever talks to me .

let' s get rocking !
morning , summer .
groupie ?
what' s the matter ?
you want me to be a groupie ?
groupie is an important job .
i researched groupies on the internet .
they' re sluts .
they sleep with the band .
no .
that' s not true .
they' re like cheerleaders .
i don' t want to be a cheerleader .
look , my mother is a room parent , and she' s not gonna be happy when she hears about this .
ok , i didn' t want to say this in front of the other kids , but i made a special position just for you .
it' s the most important job of all .
band manager .
band manager ?
oh , yeah .
what' s that ?
i' m gonna be busy rocking out , so it' s up to you to make sure everyone is doing their job .
summer , you' re in charge of everything .
ok .
ok .
all right , look alive .
listen up .

michelle ?
here .
ok .
and marco ?
here .
ok .
summer .
here .
let' s see .
tomika ?

so who do you like ?
blondie ?
christina aguilera .

no .
come on .

ten to 1 1 , rock appreciation and theory .
then band practice till the end of the day .
what about math ?
no .
not important .
world cultures ?
not important .
we need to focus .
don' t you wanna win this contest ?
it' s prestigious .
how are we being graded in all this ?
since i' m band manager , and i have the most responsibility , wouldn' t ... ?
summer , if you grade grub , i will send you back to the first grade .
you got it ?
back to your seat now .
fine .
what are we gonna play ?
you don' t have to worry about that .
we have awesome material , which i wrote .
let' s hear it .
what ?
let' s hear your song .
you wanna hear my song ?
i' il play you my song , if you want .
the thing is , i just want you to keep in mind ,
i wrote it in , like , 1 5 minutes .
it' s not done .
you might not like ...
just play the song , schneebly .
ok , i will sing it for you , but let me just get in the zone .
i was not planning on unveiling it , but i will sing it .
tip of the tongue , teeth and the lips .
ok .
it starts off ... ... a dark stage , and then a beam of light , and you can see me and my guitar .
in the end of time
there was a man who knew the road
and the writing was written on the stone
and then a thin layer of fog comes in around my ankles .
roadies , that means dry ice .
we' re gonna talk about this later .
in the ancient time
an artist led the way
but no one seemed to understand
chimes , freddy .
in his heart he knew
the artist must be true
but the legend of the rent was way past due
and then , katie , you come in with the bass .
well , you think you' il be just fine without me , but you' re mine
you think you can kick me out of the band
and then , zack , you come in with a face melter .
ok ?
well , there' s just one problem there
the band is mine
how can you kick me out of what is mine ?
and then ...
hawaii five o.
you ever see that show ?
you' re not hardcore
unless you live hardcore
well , you' re not hardcore no , you' re not hardcore
unless you live hardc ...
unless you live hardcore
but the legend of the rent was way hardcore
boom !
big old explosion .
some , like , confetti comes down .
that' s all i got so far .
it' s a work in progress .
i liked it , mr. schneebly .
i thought it was really catchy .
thank you .
mr. s ?
we came up with some names for the band .
yeah ?
hit me .
the bumblebees ?
no , it' s sissy .
the koala bears ?
what are you talking about ?
it' s sissy .
i need to speak with principal mullins .
hey , miss mullins .
hello .
how' s it going ?
how about " pig rectum " ?
michelle !
it' s a science project .
listen , ros , i was thinking about organizing a field trip .
what do you think about that ?
well ... ... substitutes , as a rule , do not organize field trips .
but i figure i' m gonna be here for a while .
well , that remains to be seen .
have you met our other teachers ?
no .
but the kids could learn by getting out of the classroom .
it' s more complicated than that .
there' s safety issues .
parents need to be notified .
it' s against school policy .
mr. s , i have a lot of ideas .
how about everyone in magenta with beads and sequins ?
billy , i' m talking to principal mullins .
oh , hi .
william .
i' il make up some samples .
everyone , this is ned schneebly .
he' s covering for gail .
gabe green .
he teaches second .
jane lemmons , fourth .
bob' s our p. e. teacher .
roberta' s our librarian .
how do you do ?
care to join us , mr. schneebly ?
yeah .
did i say that correctly ?
schneebly " ?
actually , it' s " schnayblay " .
we were just discussing testing .
which test do you find most effective , the tass or the wilson binet ?
i say no testing , and i will tell you why , joe .
gabe .
gabe .
i believe ... ... that the children are the future .
now , you can teach them well , but you have gotta let them lead the way .
let the children' s laughter ... ... just remind us how we used to be .
that' s what i decided long ago .

all right .
everybody , class has begun .
and you know what ?
you guys have been doing real good in here .
if i was gonna give you a grade , i' d give you an a.

no .
eleni ?
getting wasted .
no .
come on .

leonard .
sticking it to the man ?
yes !
but you can' t just say it , man .
you gotta feel it in your blood and guts .
if you wanna rock , you gotta break the rules .
you gotta get mad at the man , and right now i' m the man .
that' s right , i' m the man , and who' s got the guts to tell me off ?
who' s gonna tell me off ?
shut the hell up , schneebly !
that' s it , freddy .
that' s it .
who can top him ?
get out of here , stupid ass .
yes , alicia .

oh , yeah .
i was this close to getting a chair on the polish philharmonic , and i nailed the audish , but i didn' t get it .
guess who did .
yo yo ma' s cousin , little " nepotis " .
anyway , i just decided to give up and become a teacher , because those that can' t do , teach .
and those that can' t teach , teach gym .
am i right ?
i' m just joshing .
cute .
hey , mr. schneebly .
hey , zack .
that was a really cool lesson today .
well , thanks , dude .

freddy , where are your sleeves ?
and what have you done to your hair ?
it' s called punk .

miss mullins , you' re the man .
thank you , frankie .
good morning .
parents ' night is coming up , and i expect everyone to have a presentation .
what ?
hot !
you ok ?
it' s all right .
as you know , it is the most important event of the year .
the parents scrutinize our every move , so i find it' s best to over prepare .
right ?
the best defense is a good offense .
and , roberta , now that i see you ...
hey , is she always like that ?
oh , yeah .
except for the time she got drunk at the alumni dinner .
you should have seen that .
she got up on the table and did a stevie nicks impersonation .
and she wasn' t bad .
remember , she took up the tablecloth and whirled around with it ? ... that had been on the turkey tray that were touched over onto the peanut butter and jelly tray .
now , i know that you know that this is a severe problem .
clear .
come on .
go , go , go !
all right , you guys .
is everybody ready ?
yeah .
strap in .
let' s do this .
oh , dude , cool .
three horns .
that' s very clever .

i don' t think i can sing .
what are you talking about ?
come here .
so , tomika , what' s going on ?
what do you mean , you can' t sing ?
i don' t feel good .
i feel sick .
just let alicia and marta do it .
no .
they can' t sing like you can .
i need you .
what is it ?
are you nervous ?
yeah ?
why ?
what are you afraid of ?
they' re gonna laugh at me .
why would they laugh at you ?
i don' t know .
because i' m fat .
tomika ...
hey , you' ve got something everybody wants .
you' ve got talent , girl .
you have an incredible voice .
i' m not just saying that .
you heard of aretha franklin , right ?
ok , she' s a big lady .
but when she sings , she blows people' s minds .
everybody wants to party with aretha !
and you know who else has a weight issue ?
who ?
me .
but once i get up on stage , start doing my thing , people worship me .
because i' m sexy and chubby , man .
why aren' t you on a diet ?
because i like to eat .
is that such a crime ?
you know what ?
that' s not even the point .
the thing is , you' re a rock star now .
all you gotta do is rock your heart out .
people are gonna dig you , i swear .
let' s just show them what we got .
what do you say ?
ok .
thank you .
let' s rock .

freddy , get out of that van this instant .
see you guys .
you think you' re pretty funny , partying with an innocent little kid ?
dude , we' re just chilling .
that kid' s 1 0 years old .
he looks up to you .
you are setting an example for him , so start acting like a responsible adult !
that goes for all of you guys .
don' t make me come back here .
come on .
let' s go .
what' s the big deal ?
you' re acting like my mom .
what' s the big deal ?
you had me worried sick .
i was hanging with real rockers .
they aren' t real rockers .
they' re posers .
rock ain' t about getting loaded and being a jerk .
now , this is serious business here .
we' ve got a mission .
putting on a great show is the most important thing .
one great rock show can change the world .
do you understand me ?
yeah .
if you ever scare me like that again , so help me ,
i will send a note home to your parents .
let' s go .
all right , you guys .
just wait here for a minute .
hey , man , check this place out .
yeah .
it' s cool .

my band .
kids ?
is this some kind of gimmick ?
it' s not a gimmick .
they' re kids , but they' re awesome .
thanks for coming down , but you' re really not what we' re looking for .
these kids have worked their fingers to the bone just to play one song for you , so sit down , shut up and listen !
sheila , call security .
oh , god .
it was just a warm up .
we' il still compete against the other schools .
what ?
this is the gig , summer .
this was our woodstock .
then we shouldn' t take no for an answer .
don' t take no for an answer ?
he was gonna call the fuzz .
would you just listen to me ?
i have an idea .
hi there .
hi .
it' s ok .
it' s cool .
i just wanted to say , i' m really sorry .
i shouldn' t have barged in here .
it wasn' t fair to you or the kids , especially after what they' ve been through .
god , i feel like a jerk .
god .
i' m taking them back to the hospital .
just wanted to say i' m sorry .
that' s fine .
see , i volunteer down at st. margarita' s , in the children' s wing ,
teaching music .
really ?
that' s nice .
that' s very nice .
actually , it isn' t , because i totally screwed up .
i told the kids if they practiced , they' d get into battle of the bands .
what did you tell them that for ?
i don' t know .
i just ...
i wanted to give them something to look forward to , to keep their spirits up .
look at them .
they' re terminal .
every last one of them .
jeez .
yeah , and all they wanted to do before they bit the dust was play battle of the bands .
what do they all have ?
it' s a ...
it' s a rare blood disease .
stick it to da man niosis " .
what' s that ?
i' ve never heard of it .
you' re lucky .
because it' s hell .
wow .
we' re on the bill .
yes !
cut it out !
you' re dying , remember ?
get in the van .
we come from the land of the ice and snow
from the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
the hammer of the gods
summer , you get an a plus and 50 gold stars .
i didn' t do it for the grade .
give me some of that .
yeah !
yeah !
and it was so scary .
hey , mr. s ?
we have a name for the band .
hit me .
the school of rock .
the school of rock .
and we shall teach rock ' n ' roll to the world .
there' s no way you can stop
the school of rock yeah
stop .
we have a red alert .
it' s mullins .
let' s go .
come on .
to your positions .
to your positions !
come on , come on .
and therefore , e=mc .
oh , miss mullins .
come in .
i' m sorry to interrupt , but miss lemmons said she heard music
coming from the classroom .
music ?
music .
i haven' t heard any music .
you know what ?
miss lemmons must be on crack , right , kids ?
well ...
well , what' s that ?
oh , that .
yeah .
we were singing .
we were singing and learning .
we were learning in sing song .
one of your methods ?
yeah .
i find it' s helpful when you' re teaching the subjects that are the boring subjects .
well , you don' t mind if i just sit in on your class this afternoon , do you ?
no .
no .
come on back this afternoon .
it is the afternoon .
i meant now .
so please just continue with your method .
yeah .
ok .
math is a wonderful thing
math is a really cool thing
so get off your " ath " let' s do some math
math , math , math , math , math
three minus four is ...
negative one .
that' s right .
and six times a billion is ...
six billion ?
nailed it .
and 54 is 45 more than ...
what is the answer , marta ?
nine .
no , it' s eight
no , it' s nine
yes , i was testing you it' s nine
and that' s a magic number
i' m very happy that you' re able to extend your stay , but i must say , i find your methods of teaching very unusual .
well , i did study with dr. errol von straussenburgerbecken .
who ?
oh , you don' t know him ?
oh , he' s , like , one of the leading leaders in ... unusual methods .
actually , he' s how i was appointed to the presidential council for experimental educationers .
that sounds very impressive , but we' re not interested in experimental education here .
so if from now on you could just stick to the curriculum , that would be great .
yes .
right .
thank you .
ros ?
yes ?
do you know ,
i would really love to talk some more about your philosophy on teaching .
do you think maybe we could grab some coffee ?
you want to go get some coffee with me ?
yeah .
i really would .
you' re sure you don' t have coffee ?
i' m quite sure .
well , i' ve never been here before .
i' ve never been to this side of town before , in fact .
so i have been ...
well , i' ve been ...
i' ve been dying to ask you something , mr. schneebly .
please , call me " dewey " .
dewey ?
ned .
call me " ned " .
i was thinking of my other name .
my middle name .
yeah .
well , ned ...
... in your experience , how does horace green compare to the other schools that you' ve taught at ?
oh , your school is the best .
you' re just saying that .
i' m not .
you know that kids at other schools just have fun all the time ?
they run around .
there' s no discipline .
they' re happy .
it' s anarchy .
this is the best school i have ever teached at .
i swear .
i' il drink to that .
stay there .
i' m gonna put on some music .
i love this song .
really ?
yes .
stevie nicks .
yeah .
stevie !
you know , she came to town , and she did a concert ,
and she was just so ... wild .
i know .
oh , man .
oh , my gosh .
she put on the best show ever .
she' s better live than she is on the album .
you know what i mean ?
yes , yes .
oh , my gosh , no comparison .
yeah .
you know what ?
oh , man , i would love to take the kids to a concert .
concert ?
yeah .
there' s one at the end of the month .
the philharmonic .
they do classics .
they do beethoven , mozart ... ... enya , that kind of stuff .
but you have a policy about field trips .
would it be educational ?
would it be educational ?
it could be very educational .
maybe we can make an exception .
yes !
sings a song sounds like she' s singing
ooh , baby , ooh , ooh
i' m holding you to that .
make an exception .
ooh , baby , ooh , said ooh
tomorrow
keeping your head over water making a wave when you can
temporary layoff good time
easy credit rip off good time
scratching and surviving good time
would you stop that , please ?
yeah .
i had a really nice time .
yeah , ditto .
this is the first time a teacher has asked me
to do anything outside of school .
no way .
it' s ...
it' s true .
in six years .
well , you know ,
i think it might be one of those things where people are intimidated .
intimidated ?
they hate me .
no .
they don' t .
yes , they do .
they sure do .
i can see .
i wasn' t always like this .
i wasn' t always wound this tight .
there was a time when i was fun .
i was funny .
i was .
but you can' t be funny and be the principal of a prep school .
no , you cannot , because when it comes to their kids , these parents , they have no sense of humor .
if anything goes wrong , it' s my head .
it' s my head in the smasher .
these parents will come down on me like a nuclear bomb .
i can' t make a mistake .
i gotta be perfect .
and that pressure has turned me into one thing that i never wanted to be .
a bitch .
no .
you' re not .
yes , i am .
i am a big one .
well , i don' t think so .
i think you' re pretty cool .
really ?
no .
yeah .
you' re way cool .
really ?
ok , drums ?
house .
keyboards ?
house .
amps ?
all right .
cable ?
got them .
all right .
guitar ?
yes .
mr. s. yeah ?
what do you think ?
i don' t know .
i ...
they might be a little distracting .
it' s glitter rock and it' s glam and it' s fabulous .
billy , it' s just not the right style .
you' re gonna talk to me about style ?
you can' t dress yourself .
look at that bow tie .
don' t talk about my bow tie .
you know what , i give up .
they can just wear their uniforms .
that' s not a bad idea .
not a bad idea ?
i was kidding .
excuse me .
hey , hey .
what is that ?
what' s what ?
what are you playing ?
just something i wrote .
you wrote a song ?
well , let' s hear it .
no , it' s not that good .
come on , i want to hear it , kurt cobain .
ok , but i' m not much of a singer .
it' s all right .
baby , we were making straight a' s
but we were stuck in a dumb daze
don' t take much to memorize your lies
feel like i' ve been hypnotized
wait .
you wrote that ?
you wrote that ?
that' s it .
guys , rock ' n ' roll positions .
what are you doing ?
we' re gonna learn your song .
but why ?
that' s what bands do , man .

d.

d ... ... c , g , c.
baby , we were making straight a' s yeah .
yeah .
but we were stuck in a dumb daze
don' t take much to memorize your lies
and if you wanna be the teacher' s pet
baby , you just better forget it
rock is the reason rock is the rhyme
know what would be better ?
rock got no reason , rock got no rhyme .
can we try that ?
try that .
can we take it from the chorus ?
one , two , three , four .
one , two , three .
and if you wanna be the teacher' s pet
baby , you just better forget it
rock got no reason rock got no rhyme
you' d better get me to school on time and if you wanna be the teacher' s pet
baby , you just better forget it
rock got no reason rock got no rhyme
you better get me to school on time
i' m gonna solo there if it' s cool with you .
all right .
you can solo later .
ok .
let me rock a solo there , i can feel it .
tomorrow is the big day , so get your rest .
no late parties , drinking tequila and trying to get lucky .
chances like this do not come around every day .
you' ve played hard in here , and i am proud of every last stinking one of you .
let' s just give this everything we got .
we may fall on our faces , but if we do , we will fall with dignity !
with a guitar in our hands and rock in our hearts !
we roll tonight to the guitar bite ,
and for those about to rock ...
... i salute you .
ros , excuse me , wanted to remind you about our field trip tomorrow .
what field trip ?
the educational concert .
oh , i forgot about that .
i don' t know , school policy is very difficult to get around .
but you said we could make an exception , and the kids are excited about hearing some mozart .
i know , but the preparations , there' s not enough time .
i don' t know anything about it .
where is it ?
i' ve got it all covered .
what' s going on , are you mad at me ?
no , no , ned .
i' m sorry , i' m just a little stressed out because it' s parents ' night tonight .
hey , it' s all gonna be fine .
ned , would you mind coming with me tonight to parents ' night ?
it wouldn' t be a date or anything .
i get nervous around the parents , and there' s something about you that makes me feel more relaxed .
you know what , that sounds so great , ros , but ...
but what ?
i wasn' t planning on going tonight .
you have to .
you' re their teacher .
you have to give the presentation .
oh , yeah , yeah .
no , i got you .
i' m ready for that .
so we' il go together ?
ok .
why don' t you pick me up at , say , 6 : 40 .
done .
all right .
ok .
what are you all dressed up for ?
i got a hot date .
that' s weird .
i got a check from horace green prep for $1, 200 .
i' ve never worked there .
what are you doing ?
calling the school .
hi , this is ned schneebly ...
dewey ?
what' s going on ?
i told them 1 5 times , make it out to cash !
dewey ?
i did something bad , ned .
no .
yeah .
they called for a sub .
i said i was you , to make some money .
but then i got there , and the kids , they rock , man .
she thought she was too fat , so they were dying , and the principal got drunk .
now we' re playing battle of the bands .
it' s the coolest thing !
one day .
then i will come clean .
i' il tell everyone it was my fault .
you' il be fine .
one day !
ned , home .
don' t say anything to her .
she' il blow everything .

ros ... ... l' m not a teacher .
oh , ned .
a substitute is a teacher .
no , no .
i' m not a teacher .
i' m a fraud .
no .
you' re not .
you' re a dedicated , talented teacher , and those parents are gonna love you .
just get in there and tell those parents what you' ve been teaching their kids .
yeah , you know , math , english ...
what ... ?
science ...
what else ?
geography , history ,
latin , spanish , french ,
latin ...
math .
did i say that already ?
anyway , all the stuff you want your kids to know , it' s been covered , ok ?
so ... ... it was great to meet you all , and drive safe .
excuse me .
since you started , all my son talks about is music .
he says he wants to be a musician .
is this your influence ?
why has my daughter become obsessed with david geffen ?
and how is this homework ?
ok , see , i would like to tell you about what we' ve been doing in here , but there' s such a thing as teacher student confidentiality , and i don' t want to be in breach of educational law because i could be dismembered by the teacher' s union .
so ...
you expect us to believe this garbage ?
mr. s , don' t you think you should tell them about the project ?
what project ?
our class project .
every school in the state is competing .
competing ?
it' s not till next quarter , but mr. s wanted us to get a head start .
well , what' s the project , summer ?
it' s prestigious .
a win will go on our permanent record .
you might as well tell them , mr. schneebly .
ok , look .
i' ve gotten to know your kids the past few weeks .
they' re awesome .
zack is an insane guitarist .
he' s the next hendrix , and he' s 1 0 .
and gordon here , he' s a genius !
he did a whole professional light show on his computer in three days .
and ...
and marta here , she' s ...
she can hit an a above high c.
did you know that ?
because that' s tough .
not many singers can do that .
and ...
summer is gonna be the first woman president of the united states .
she could run this year .
i would vote for her .
look , they' re just really cool kids .
if they were mine , i would be so proud .
and i am proud , just to even know them .
and ...
sir , can i see you in the hall for a moment ?
let me just say a couple more things .
what' s going on ?
what' s happening ?
apparently , that man is not ned schneebly .
what ?
what ?
this man is ned schneebly .
he' s not even a teacher .
you called the cops ?
she did .
she got it out of me .
sorry .
you' re apologizing to him ?
sorry .
ned .
ned , is this true ?
who are you ?
my name is dewey finn .
and , no , i' m not a licensed teacher , but i have been touched by your kids .
and i' m pretty sure i' ve touched them .
what ?
oh , my god .
i have nothing to say to you .
me either .
ok .
i' m going to bed .
it' s one thing to throw your life away , but to put ned in jeopardy is selfish .
you told me to be like ned and get a job .
i told you to be like ned , i didn' t tell you to be ned .
you' re not gonna apologize ?
you apologize for calling the cops .
i didn' t murder anybody .
i wanted to play a great show .
i was this close .
shut up !
shut up !
shut up !
would you both just cut it out for one second ?
look , i' m sorry , dude .
i was desperate .
it was easy for you to give up music .
it ain' t easy for me .
it wasn' t easy for me .
i miss it .
well , then why' d you give it up ?
because i couldn' t keep kidding myself anymore .
you can blame it all on bad luck , but in the end , maybe we just weren' t that good .
sometimes you gotta know when to quit .
right , maybe i suck .
that' s not what i said .
well , music is my life , man .
what do you want me to do ?
i don' t know , but ... ... i think it' s time you moved out .
sorry .
so his name wasn' t mr. schneebly ?
no , it was , like , dewey something .
what about the project ?
wake up , marco , there was no project .
he wanted us to play a show so we could make money .
i can' t believe we weren' t graded .
why are you bummed ?
we had a three week vacation .
it was a waste of time , but it was better than school .
it was not a waste of time .
yeah , that' s what it was .
you' re an idiot .
shut up .
no , you shut up .
you want to go ?
touch him , i' il shove those sticks down your throat .
mr. s was cool .
we worked too long and too hard not to play the show .
ok , so what are we supposed to do ?
we get out of here and play the damn show .
how could you let our kids be exposed to this impostor ?
do you just let anyone teach here ?
i pay $1 5, 000 ...
let me assure you that nothing is more important to us than for you to feel your children are in a safe and secure environment .
ok , we' re all here .
where' s mr. schneebly ?
he didn' t tell you ?
he' s at home .
we need to pick him up .
let' s go , hurry .
