take him out .
nasty shit becomes routine when you live like a gangster .
you think you' re prepared for everything .
until the day you' re ordered to kill your best friend .
my dad knew every pakistani in oslo , and they all knew him .
it always took forever to walk down the street .
and he always had to haggle .
hello .
welcome .
l hated that .
what are you looking at , boys ?
ask how much they are .
how much are these ?
398 kroner .
levi' s .
398 kroner , dad .
i heard him .
ask how much these are .
those are girls ' pants .
ask how much they are .
how much are these ?
they were in the discount basket .
they are 49 kroner per pair .
nice quality , but not exactly your style .
i know .
in pakistan they cost ten rupees .
that' s five kroner .
tell him 100 kroner for all four .
can we buy all four pairs for 100 kroner ?
they are 49 kroner each .
they are already on sale .
i' ve never heard a pakistani haggle so poorly !
we' il take these .
damn kids grow so fast .
100 kroner ?
no , as i told your son ...
my son doesn' t understand anything !
125 kroner .
you' re expensive .
they are already on sale !
196 kroner .
come , boys !
150 kroner .
my final offer .
hey , garlic !
where do you think you' re going ?
inside .
you can' t get in .
why not ?
because you stink .
i was 13 that fall .
i lived in one of the safest , most boring cities in the world .
but my life was far from boring .
the three of us were inseparable .
munawar was always looking for action and always in a good mood .
riaz was my neighbor .
we were like brothers .
l was the smallest .
not the youngest , but the smallest .
being small has its advantages .
everyone thinks you' re innocent .
look !
levi' s .
this is excellent .
we watched bollywood films , and dreamt of being like those heroes .
we weren' t going to end up losers .
a bus driver was the last thing we wanted to be .
all pakis in norway were losers , with a few exceptions .
47 , 48 , 49 , 50 !
come on !
get up !
ok , now a combination .
come on , you and me .
you meet someone , make small talk .
a bouncer , or whatever .
what ?
what have we done to you ?
and there !
step back , and ... bang !
his eardrum is popped , ok ?
you meet some guy ...
ok , pay attention .
then you go like this .
got it ?
up there !
saddiq was the most dangerous person we knew of .
saddiq and khalid , his brother , trained pakis for their gang .
the gang was called east side crew .
you didn' t mess with them .
come on !
good !
punks !
what are you doing here ?
are you spying ?
what did you see ?
nothing .
spies get punished , right ?
line them up .
one for each of us .
try the first combination .
remember the elbow .
don' t !
please !
shut up !
wait !
i found a boxcar full of levi' s .
like the ones we' re wearing .
where ?
right over here .
where ?
show me .
if you' re lying , i' il beat the shit out of you .
and you .
and you .
where are they ?
they' re ...
what do we get for showing you ?
attitude !
he has attitude !
i like that .
you got a big mouth , huh ?
just show me .
what are your names ?
wasim .
munawar .
riaz .
i have a job for you .
if you dare .
what kind of a job ?
come on , guys !
... and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
but when jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said unto them ...
thank you , eva .
wasim ?
can you read for us ?
page 107 .
start from " ... said unto them .
at the top of the page .
suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not ,
for of such is the kingdom of god .
what do you think he meant by that ?
who ?
jesus .
how should i know ?
this is the third time you haven' t paid attention .
please leave .
leave ?
where ?
out in the hall .
what the fuck ?
what kind of language is that ?
fuck , i haven' t done anything !
what is the matter with you ?
you simply can' t behave like that here .
the norwegian school is based on respect .
respect for each other .
respect for the teachers .
respect for yourself .
everyone has to respect each other .
for riaz .
here .
munawar .
come on .
and wasim .
you are expelled for one week .
and your parents must sign this letter .
wasim , what is this ?
i had a school project and got the highest grade .
the highest grade again !
where do i sign ?
you can sign your name here .
mom didn' t say anything .
she didn' t understand norwegian .
pops worked as a night watchman and had a cleaning job .
when he was home , all he wanted to do was sleep .
wasim , go make tea for your father .
i don' t want tea .
i' m going to sleep for an hour , then back to work .
where are you going now , wasim ?
i have practice .
ok .
bye .
who is it ?
ls riaz home ?
yes .
would you like to eat with us ?
we have to hurry .
we' re in a hurry !
riaz , have you eaten ?
hey , the boys showed up !
come on .
let' s get going .
hi , bullet .
hey there .
everything ok ?
come on .
hey , hold on !
what' s the matter ?
what' s this ?
what the hell do you mean ?
that' s 250 .
350, 000 .
give me a break !
you didn' t mention the alarm .
that costs more .
carry everything back !
what' s this ?
an alarm ?
i' d like to know about things like that .
320 .
that' s all i' ve got .
320, 000 .
you think this is a flea market ?
fine .
forget about it .
ok !
fine .
go fuck your sister !
what was that ?
what was that ?
i just said you were a good business partner .
you can save that monkey language for the jungle .
we stick to city talk here .
go ahead , boys !
here .
keep your mouths shut , and we might give you more jobs .
wasim , what are you doing home ?
no school today .
planning day .
who was that at the door ?
no one .
goddamn kids !
they have no respect .
if i get my hands on them , i' il wring their necks !
haven' t you learned ...
i' m sorry .
i thought it was those bastards ... children that ...
are you wasim khan' s father ?
i' m his principal .
is wasim home ?
wasim ?
yes , he is home .
wasim !
there you are .
why haven' t you been to school for three weeks ?
three weeks ?
you disobedient , stupid brat !!
why don' t you read and memorize ?
you little brat !
get out there and read !
dad sent me to pakistan to study the koran .
so i would become more respectful .
pakistan was like a different planet .
what was i supposed to do there ?
wasim ?
you have to go to school !
wasim , where are you ?
i know you' re hiding .
you' re just doing this to irritate me .
i won' t give up until i find you !
i lived with an aunt i didn' t know .
she nagged all the time , just like everyone back in norway .
dad left me alone there for two years .
in the village he himself had left .
everyone was foreign to me .
i had no one to talk to .
when i was 15 i came home again .
almost everything had changed .
dad had bought a snack bar and we had moved to stovner .
a goddam boring place , far from the city .
hello ?
hello ?
who was that , honey ?
no one , mother .
wasim , where are you going ?
i' m just going out .
he' s here !
get out of the car , boys .
come on .
east side crew hadn' t become any smaller .
the major newspapers had yet to realize there were any paki gangs .
and the politicians wouldn' t understand anything for years .
good to see you !
ten years later
east side crew had become renowned in the ' 90s .
and we three buddies had stuck together .
munawar .
riaz .
and me .
we three were the super sellers .
we handled everything that could be bought and sold in oslo' s underworld .
farooq and his muscle boys
beat up , threatened or whacked anyone who got in our way .
farooq was the worst .
saddiq trusted him 100 % .
saddiq , and his big brother khalid .
they came to an uncle in norway as kids .
he beat the shit out of them .
refused to let them go to school .
one day the uncle disappeared .
everyone suspected them .
but no body was ever found .
their goal was to take over oslo .
the only one in their way was the bullet .
hey , guys , feel free to come and play whenever you want .
isn' t it nice here ?
best place in town .
hey , we aren' t here to play .
come on , boys .
bullet , i want to buy .
the usual place .
1 500 for a fiver .
no .
1 000 .
saddiq , lots of guys want your job .
we had an ongoing business with the bullet , buying and reselling smack .
but saddiq felt we could be bigger .
so we started importing our own .
we had monthly mules from pakistan .
via copenhagen , stockholm , amsterdam .
we had a lot of smack , but no trouble getting rid of it .
our biggest client was the swede .
a failed rocker who dealt drugs to other failed rockers .
he was the bullet' s client , but we didn' t give a shit .
hey , wasim .
hey .
you' re late .
you want my business to go to hell ?
something to drink ?
whiskey ?
vodka ?
i have corona .
straight from mexico , hombre !
everything ok ?
we always kept the cash one place , the stash somewhere else .
yeah ?
you can order the food .
get caught with cash and drugs in the same place , and you' re fucked .
harry was the swede' s drug tester .
he was awesome .
harry could tell where it came from ,
and most likely who smuggled it in .
we have a deal .
you' ve got 14 days to pay the rest .
1, 530, 000 in cash .
monday the 25th at 12 noon .
sharp .
this is as good as sold .
i need more by the end of the week .
the same amount ?
if that' s all you can get .
or should i go back to the bullet ?
pay us within a week , and we' il get you more .
deal ?
deal .
respect .
respect , man !
the bullet didn' t like us stealing his clients .
something had to happen .
those gunshots could have triggered a war .
but saddiq understood that would be bad business .
the bullet stuck to the west side ,
we took over the rest of oslo .
times were good .
we made more than we could spend .
all those other pakis were losers .
they never got any respect , while we took the respect we deserved .
we were kings on the town .
thank you , god , for my devoted son
that manages to get home at five a . m . !
give me your key !
what ?
shut up and get out !
i know what you' re up to .
you' re no longer welcome here .
you think that makes me sad ?
that i like living here ?
you think i live here for my own sake ?
god help you if you walk out .
imagine what people will say !
my sons shall marry
and live with their wives and children in this home , with us .
everything ok ?
sure .
khalid and saddiq started a caf as a cover .
it was a hole in the wall ,
but not many places in oslo had that kind of turnover .
go get a van in bjrkelangen .
this is not a good time .
i have a date with nina .
it' s her birthday .
i have plans .
i can' t do this .
you what ?
relax .
relax .
he' il do it .
we have to be two .
then let' s go right now !
riaz had started to change .
didn' t respect the leaders .
put himself above others .
hurry !
i have to be back by nine .
not a chance .
maybe if you speed up .
i' m tired of being an errand boy for him !
come on !
you' re always so slow !
don' t make a scene .
fucking khalid !
he still treats us like punks .
it turned out khalid was doing riaz ' girlfriend whenever he sent us out .
that always leads to trouble .
wasim , i' m leaving .
wish her a happy birthday from me .
khalid got caught the morning after we picked up that van .
they found heroin in his car .
that isn' t mine , i' m telling you !
the same heroin only riaz and i knew about .
saddiq and khalid weren' t norwegian citizens .
khalid was deported to pakistan .
the worst thing that could happen .
it took several months to find riaz , but saddiq refused to give up .
khalid was saddiq' s only family , and he swore revenge .
i don' t know how riaz thought he could get away .
no one here .
not here either .
where is riaz ?
where is riaz ? !
where the fuck is riaz ? !
if you tell me where he is ...
i' il let you live ...
a normal life .
lisa ?
wasim !
come here .
check his breathing .
check his breathing !
he' s alive .
good .
take him out .
take him out ?
me ?
yes .
you .
are you fucking deaf , or what ?
why me ?
all the drugs disappeared when riaz snitched .
we needed new mules .
you' d think it would be hard to find someone .
but there was always some desperate paki in need of cash .
wasim ?
wasim ?
yes .
i' m coming .
do you have a paper towel ?
yes , sir .
wasim .
ok , babar .
you go to pakistan on saturday .
you get two days to visit family .
then you stay in our house in lahore the rest of the week .
you get 100, 000 cash for the job .
on delivery .
but i need the money now .
the bank is going to take my store .
you have to help me !
farooq ?
you get half now , the rest on delivery .
minus 10 % for this loan .
thank you , brother .
praise god !
if you fail , or if something should go wrong ,
we' il find out everything you tell the police .
wasim .
i guarantee you' re a dead man if you rat on us .
even if you' re in solitary confinement .
if the heroin or you disappear , we' il find you .
guaranteed .
hey !
do you have a video camera ?
the insurance company told me i had to !
you know i can' t be filmed !
is this the only copy ?
your life isn' t worth much !
you understand ?
you understand ? !
answer me , dammit !
wasim ...
wasim .
farooq , give me five minutes .
i' m unsure about him .
no .
he imports fruit .
he often takes trips to pakistan .
customs has checked him .
they know who he is .
ok .
you haven' t done anything wrong .
what about this ?
burn it .
my little brother , amir , also had problems staying out of trouble .
boss ...
what is it ?
amir .
he wants another 50, 000 credit .
amir felt sorry for himself because he was so fat .
it didn' t help that he worked with pops at the snack bar .
three daily cheeseburgers with dressing and fries ,
and pretty soon you look like nusrat fateh ali khan .
what did you say ?
could you repeat that ?
could you say that again ?
i didn' t know i owed that much .
didn' t know you owed that much ? !
you' ve been gambling for three days straight , losing the entire time !
you owe me 150, 000 !
i' m not paying you anything .
what' s that ?
i didn' t hear you .
you' re cheating .
that lady clearly cheated .
me , cheat ?
you don' t understand how serious this is .
what' s the stress ?
tonight is renate' s last night .
get in the car .
it' s amir .
hurry up !
come on !
are you gambling again ?
listen to mr. perfect .
at least i can take care of myself .
look at you .
who was it ?
no one .
i said , who !
i' m telling you , no one .
it was the bullet .
the bullet ? !
shit !
i don' t fucking get it .
why australia ?
could you please shut up about renate for one second ?
i don' t mind her going to school .
that' s fine .
but the other side of the world ?
she wants to get away !
concentrate .
relax .
i' ve been concentrating all night .
there he is .
this is not a good idea .
where the hell is he ?
dammit !
so goddam slow ...
don' t move !
don' t move !
easy , wasim .
can' t we talk ?
shut up .
we can fix this .
shut up !
on your knees .
we can agree on a price .
shut up !
on your knees .
give me a price .
anything .
this isn' t right .
you die now .
what did you do to my brother ?
take it easy ...
think .
be reasonable .
you can' t live with this !
what are you doing here ?
what' s this , saddiq ?
what' s going on ?
the prick beat up my brother .
wasim , relax .
take it easy .
put your gun away .
does that mean i can get up ?
of course .
wasim ...
what are you doing here ?
relax .
what are you doing here ?
come with us .
babar got caught with the drugs .
our supplies have dried up .
you were right .
he wasn' t a pro .
that was unfortunate , for him and for us .
we had to make a deal with the bullet .
he helps us deliver now , we help him later .
you could have said something .
munawar ?
we need a new courier .
you have to go to pakistan .
why him ?
you think the customs agents are that stupid ?
when ?
on saturday .
bring the money down ?
no .
the drugs up .
we' il send the money with someone else .
this is business , wasim .
get your brother to stop gambling , instead of going after the bullet .
i don' t want any trouble with the bullet !
don' t get out .
i' il go with you .
they' il be onto us , if they see us together .
give them my best .
who ?
everyone .
all of pakistan .
shit , i haven' t been there since i was 15 .
you looked like a real hick when you came home .
take care .
don' t look the agents in the eye .
i' m not going to pakistan .
this is no life .
i' m going with renate to australia .
why tell me ?
couldn' t you just have left ?
what are you going to do about it ?
shoot me , too ?
just get out of here !
tell them whatever you want .
i don' t give a shit .
take it easy .
i am taking it easy .
wasim , my boy , drive a little slower .
uncle and auntie want you to visit .
i agree .
you come with us next time .
right , mom ?
hey , wasim .
come in .
are you hungry ?
munawar never showed up .
the money made it , but no mule .
are you kidding ?
what could have happened ?
i thought maybe you could tell me .
me ?
he never left .
his ticket wasn' t used .
so he' s hiding .
but where ?
where ?
how would i know ?
wasim , your friends have become a problem for us .
but if you tell me where he is , i' il let him live .
i have no idea .
he didn' t say anything .
wasim , wasim ...
don' t let your emotions get the upper hand .
even though your friends have let us down ...
i' m counting on you .
but i need to know if i can trust you .
can i ?
here .
did you rob a bank ?
i' m leaving town for a week or so .
i want you to pay an installment to the bullet .
i can' t protect you anymore , but i' il get the rest of the money .
i' il be back in a week .
hang in there until then .
what are you doing here ?
i' ve paid you .
one installment .
how' s business ?
not good .
what do you have in the till ?
today wasn' t a very good day .
we' il be back every single day until you' ve paid off your debt .
don' t eat or drink until you get the bags out of your stomach .
stewardesses are trained to look for passengers that don' t eat .
be careful .
don' t let them notice that you don' t eat or drink .
you have 24 hours .
after 24 hours the bags will break .
if they break , you' re dead .
as soon as you get back , take a laxative and get them out .
it was sheer lunacy .
i knew it .
i was bound to get caught .
and i had no one to blame but myself .
hey , you !
come over here .
drive !
just drive !
fast !
and stop at a pharmacy .
i' il give you a discount .
what ?
what' s the catch ?
saddiq can' t find out .
no way !
i can' t start a war !
there won' t be a war .
you' ve bought from freelancers before .
i' il give you a good price .
how good ?
3000 per fiver , 100 % cash up front .
2900 , 70 up front .
2950 , 80 % cash .
yeah .
deal .
respect .
respect , man !
between me and you .
no problem .
wasim ?
you ?
it' s been so long .
this is riaz ' little brother .
aslam .
remember him ?
riaz has been gone a long time , if you' re looking for him .
we don' t know where he is .
what is this ?
i owed this to riaz .
if he doesn' t come back soon , you can use it .
that' s what he would want .
thank you , my dear child .
come , aslam , let' s bring this upstairs .
how much do i owe you now ?
how much ?
199, 000 .
lncluding interest .
i have a proposal for you .
give me the snack bar .
then you can forget about your debt .
scout' s honor .
huh ?
where did you get this money ?
the lottery .
do you mind ?
i' m about to close .
getting rid of the bullet was easy .
saddiq was a bigger problem .
who did the swede buy his heroin from ?
that cheap shit ?
it was wasim , i swear .
i heard it with my own ears .
i promise .
it was wasim .
it' s me .
do it .
robina doesn' t want to get married .
let' s not talk about that now .
yes , let' s !
the day you do something for this family
you can have an opinion .
don' t i drive you to the mosque every week ?
thank you so much , my son .
is everyone ok ?
are you trying to get us all killed ?
is anyone hurt ?
dad ...
this is your fault !
mine ?
dad !
dad !
call for an ambulance !
it' s me .
we have to meet .
wasim !
wasim ...
why are we meeting here ?
what is that ?
my life insurance .
you' re on that tape as much as i am .
want to put us all away ?
i know who tried to kill me , saddiq .
as long as i am alive , no one sees that tape .
but if i die , or get harmed in any way , the cops get the tape .
do you really think that was the only copy ?
don' t forget the gun you shot riaz with , with your prints on it .
i know .
but i' m a norwegian citizen , saddiq .
you aren' t .
you' il be deported .
i' d take prison in norway any day ,
over a life sentence as a sheep farmer in pakistan .
what do you want ?
you leave me alone , i leave you alone .
ok .
what is it ?
can you pick her up after a concert ?
where ?
when ?
at rockefeller .
it ends at two .
two o' clock ?
yes .

what about robina ?
can i have her ?
just hurry up and bring the tape tomorrow .
she can handle another round .
but i wouldn' t wait too long .
i want to see her !
wasim , you have no say in the matter .
you' re the lowest type .
you' re a thief .
show her to me , or you don' t get the tape .
you shouldn' t have stolen from us .
it' s your own fault .
wake up !
i' d like to fuck your little sister myself .
and now i' il have the chance , while you' re out getting that tape .
how do i know she isn' t dead ?
farooq , get her .
let' s see if you recognize your little sister .

elin hansen .
this is quite simple .
i ask you some questions .
then we discuss the questions i have asked .
then what ?
i write an evaluation based on my perception of you .
but in the end , the prison board determines if you can be paroled .
ready ?
yes .
start by stating your name and age .
wasim khan .
age 36 .
i' d like to ask you about your father .
my dad knew every pakistani in oslo , and they all knew him .
it always took forever to walk down the street .
and he always had to haggle .
i hated that .
