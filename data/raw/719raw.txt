you don' t like me because i don' t sign autographs .
you don' t like me because i don' t smile for the camera .
you don' t like me because i don' t suck up to the press .
you don' t like me because i make a lot of money .
but you love me .
because i' m one of the greatest hitters alive .
we' re back in milwaukee , and the sound you hear reverberating across the cities and farms of the great state of wisconsin is the roar of the brewer faithful for their longtime hero , stan ross .
and here he comes with that trademark arrogant scowl .
2, 999 hits to date in his illustrious career .
will this at bat , july 29 , 1995 , against the rookie right hander billy earil , be the historic moment when ross joins only 20 other major leaguers in that elite 3, 000 hit club ?
stan .
you' re gonna be the best looking cat in the hall of fame , that' s for doggone sure .
yo , scrub !
you want my autograph now or after i make history ?
you ain' t getting this hit off me .
this is gonna be your one career highlight .
you' re gonna be a game show answer .
well , i' il take " kiss my ass " for $1, 000 .
make it 3, 000 .
you hear that language on that rookie ?
kiss my ass .
how about you , ernie ?
you' re gonna tell me to kiss your ass , too ?
why don' t you suck my ...
i' il show you what kiss my ass look like .
i' il show him .
i' il put up this ...
damn it , joe !
he know better than to get me pissed off !
no pitcher wants to be the one that gives up that 3, 000th base hit .
clearly earil just sent that message .
a purpose pitch to get ross angry .
come on , this is the one .
you know what i' m talking about !
hope he trips and breaks his leg .
uhh !
oh , my !
it' s a vicious line drive off earil' s ...
well , it' s a bell ringing base hit .
that' s what it is .
stan ross is safe at first .
hey , coach , get me that ball .
that' s the ball that got me to the hall of fame .
you want this ball , ross ?
yeah .
thanks , man .
there goes your damn ball .
you see that , coach ?
you see what he just did ?
he threw my hall of fame ball in the stands .
what' s your problem ?
back up .
back up .
move , man !
you be out when i get back , or someone will have to pull a piece of baseball history out the crack of your ass !
what you looking at ?
make a move .
okay , i' il shrink your big ass .
you' il get some , too .
you saw what he did , coach .
all right , guys .
that ain' t gonna mean nothing .
get back in .
who got my ball ?
open that gate .
all right !
he' s coming on up .
hey , congratulations , stan !
give me my ball .
what ?
what' d he say ?
give me my 3, 000 hit ball .
don' t look at your daddy .
give me my ball !
whoa , make him a trade at least .
give him your cap or an autographed bat .
i' m not trading him !
hey , whoa !
what the ...
are you all right , pal ?
why don' t you take his cotton candy while you' re at it ?
were you glad to get number 3, 000 here in milwaukee ?
sure .
you ask any of the all time greats , man .
we all got a special connection with our hometown fans .
what connection did you make with that kid who caught the ball tonight ?
what you talkin ' about ?
people in that section say you threatened him .
i gave him good advice .
what the hell wrong with you people ?
i just became a legend like willie mays ,
stan musial , and carl yastrzemski .
y' all gonna try to speak on something negative ?
that' s what i' m talkin ' about .
that' s why i' m quittin ' .
what ?
what ?
what do you mean , quitting ?
quittin ' .
i' m done .
hangin ' it up .
now that i got this , i ain' t playin ' no more .
and that means no more talking to you stank ass reporters .
excuse me ?
that' s right .
i' m talking to you .
and i said " stank ass .
why now with the brewers still in the race ?
couldn' t you wait until after the season ?
i' d have quit last season if i didn' t think you were gonna try to block me from the hall of fame .
but it don' t matter ' cause i got mine .
3, 000 .
like it or not , i' m a certified immortal .
and there ain' t nothin ' you sons of bitches can do about it .
nothin ' .
attention , all milwaukee leprechauns .

sportswriters hate me .
but my numbers don' t lie .
i got 3, 000 up there , one for each one of my hits .
they gotta let me in .
it' s my year , and everybody knows it .
what about him ?
who' s that ?
you know who that is .
that' s t rex pennebaker .
best player on the brewers .
t rex pennebaker ain' t nothin ' .
i don' t even know why you bother learning his name , especially what you got in front of you , a living legend .
a certified immortal .
and i know you don' t know a lot of immortals .
hey , easy , old man .
old man ?
what you mean is " aged , " like u. s. d. a. beef .
it' s what' s for dinner .
not on my plate .
no ?
no .
monstrous .
just ain' t like the old days , huh , boca ?
mnh mnh .
wow .
spring training .
you can practically smell the grass , can' t you ?
can' t say i can , man .
what , you don' t miss it ?
miss it ?
nah .
nah .
stan didn' t make many friends when he was playing here .
he wasn' t very good with the press .
we invited him to old timers ' day every year since he retired .
that' s nine years .
and he never rsvp' d once .
he might not want to do this , you know what i' m saying ?
no .
what are you saying ?
i' m just saying , " stan ross day .
retire his number .
the fans , man .
did he go for it ?
did you hit him with the fans bit ?
how about where you say you didn' t know if i would do it ?
boca , i swear , when you get to going , you can talk a stripe off a zebra .
monstrous .
and welcome to beautiful miller park .
ladies and gentlemen , we' re here today to retire number 21 , worn by one of the brewers ' all time greats .
seven times an all star , a member of that exclusive 3, 000 base hit club , the wizard of wood , the count of contact , and the king of the swing ,
milwaukee' s own mr. 3000 , stan ross !
wow !
damn !
i still look good .
he hasn' t lost his touch , has he ?
and joining us today to pay tribute to stan ,
let' s welcome former teammate bill " big horse " berelli .
who ?
i think he played with you a couple of months in ' 79 .
he was a middle reliever .
what happened to paul molitor , man ?
robin yount ?
cecil cooper ?
what happened to them ?
they declined .
we' re lucky we got him .
you know , a lot of people said that stan only looked out for himself .
that he wasn' t a team player .
but i' m here to tell you that if you get 3, 000 hits , you don' t have to be a team player .
what ?
if you have a lifetime . 314 average , you don' t have to be a good guy .
if you lead the league in batting for three years , you can be the biggest jerk in the world .
he laughin ' , man .
he laughin ' .
so on behalf of all of us who played alongside of you , congratulations .
go on , go on , man .
you can' t help me now .
also here with us today , you remember him well , number 8 , anthony carter .
all right , come on .
tell them like it is , boca .
come on , baby .
now we' re talkin ' .
me and stan were teammates .
man , could he hit the ball .
tell ' em , baby .
and i loved him for that .
i love you more .
that' s it ?
i' m trying to get enshrined .
that' s it ?
man , y' all killin ' me , man .
all right , milwaukee ,
let' s hear it for our brewers ' own stan ross !
thank you so much .
first , i want to thank you , mr. schembri , and the entire milwaukee brewers organization .
and to my main man , my best friend , boca carter .
and to you , old donkey .
big horse !
whatever !
but most of all , i want to thank you all .
the fans .
you were always there for me .
and i know for a fact , if it was up to you ,
i' d have been in the hall of fame a long time ago .
but unfortunately , it' s up to a bunch of sportswriters .
some metalhead half asses .
how the hell do you bat 3, 000 and not be selected into the hall of fame ?
what type of bullshit is that ?
let me tell you something .
you all believed in me when i was at my best .
you all believed in me when i was at my worst .
you , the fans !
that' s why i know for a fact
i can depend on you all to bring me , stan ross , to cooperstown .
i can hear you say " stan !
stan !
say " stan ross " !
stan ross !
stan ross !
stan ross !
he' s the boss !
he' s the boss !
say " hall of fame " !
hall of fame !
it' s a damn shame !
over here , say , " hell , yeah " !
hell , yeah !
say , " hell , yeah " !
hell , yeah !
say , " you' re the man " !
you' re the man !
let me hear it again !
you' re the man !
they love me .
you' re the man !
you got a minute ?
hang on .
what ?
you know how when we think somebody' s gonna be voted in , we run the numbers .
every win , every home run , every hit ?
yeah .
we were running that for stan ross .
a list of every one of his 3, 000 hits .
there' s an error .
one of the hits was an error ?
no , all the hits were hits .
there just aren' t 3, 000 of them .
okay .
start over .
okay , there was a game in may 1982 that was called for curfew .
when they finished in august , the hits were recorded twice .
once in may , once in august .
stan ross had three hits in that game .
that means that three of the hits don' t count .
so you' re telling me ...
stan ross , mr. 3000 ,
has only 2, 997 hits .
2, 997 hits .
as yahko tried to escape across the rope bridge , he realized that he was trapped by both sides by the dreaded , evil boars .
yahko knew his only hope was to do the unthinkable , and that was to jump far , far below into the raging , raging river .
hold on , kids .
hello ?
hey ...
hey , man , the press is eating it up .
what happens to yahko ?
shh , shh , shh , shh .
what happened to yahko ?
what ?
what happened to yahko ?
what happened to yahko ?
shut up !
i can' t believe you said that .
2, 997 ?
man , that' s bullshit !
oh , mr. ross .
ooh !
please , the children .
man , hell with the kids !
yahko' s dead !
the hall of fame vote is in , and stan ross is not .
the always controversial ex brewer had slowly crept to within four votes of enshrinement , but this time finished 147 votes shy , following a correction in the record books that left him three hits short of the magical 3, 000 .
stan' s gonna wait turn it off .
till next year to wait till next life .
from the green ...
i can' t let them do it to me .
i can' t let them take away my legacy .
# watch me ! #
# watch me ! #

# watch me ! #
# i got it , hey ! #
you love me because i' m one of the greatest hitters alive .
# i got somethin ' that tells me #

# i got soul , and i' m super bad #
you love me because i' m one of the greatest hitters alive .
# i got soul #
# and i' m super bad #
# i got it , hey ! #
i' m back !
the king with the swing , the right arm they call " the gun ,
stan ross .
nitroglycerin himself .
number 21 , the man with sweetest swing in the major league , is back .
you gotta be joking .
how old are you ?
50 ?
47 and getting younger .
that' s why i love you , man .
man , what the hell ?
what' s your damn problem , man ?
that was 4/ 10 of a second .
that' s how much time you have after the ball leaves the pitcher' s hand to decide whether it' s a fastball , a split finger .
wait , wait .
hold on , hold on , hold on .
what you know about the game ?
you played in the majors ?
figures .
he' s drunk .
no , i' ve just been a brewers fan my whole life while you treated the team and the fans and the city like dirt .
yo , boca , get this man another bottle .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
i want you to try it again .
what ?
' cause last time i wasn' t standing at the plate .
come on , try it again .
yeah .
boca .
see that ?
three more of these .
three more hits .
as i said before , stan ross is back .
better talk to him , boca .
ladies and gentlemen , number 21 , the great , the fantastic ,
mr. incredible .
stan .
i thought when we retired his number , we wouldn' t have to see that prick anymore .
he' s a senior citizen .
do you think i want him here ?
and he hasn' t played the game in nine years .
it' s not like we' re in the american league anymore , so he' s gotta play the field .
can he even handle first base at his age , let alone hit ?
fellas .
we are in fifth place , and we are not drawing flies .
and we' ve got two very long months ahead of us .
the biggest crowd we' ve had all year was the day we retired stan' s number .
now , we give him a physical .
give him a month to get in shape .
then after that september roster expansion , if he' s up to it , we put him in the lineup .
bo , all i need is a bat .
that' s it , baby .
look at him .
he ain' t got no waist on him .
he got nothin ' .
stan ross .
hey .
eddie richling .
i' m the conditioning coach .
he here to carry you home ?
the only thing boca gonna carry is my plaque .
that' s why i love you .
i love you more .
is that right ?
how many push ups can you do ?
one arm or two ?
well , i' il tell you what , last time i counted , what was it , about 40 , 50 ?
i got 5 bucks in my pocket says you can' t give me 10 .
that' s easy money .
back up , man .
you better help your boy down .
he didn' t help me in .
come on , let' s see what you got .
okay , well , that' s one .
how many is that ?
oh , i don' t know .
i' d say 40 , 50 .
that' s four .
come on , stan .
you got this one .
oh , oh !
your knee touched , man .
that' s a girl push up .
you see my knee touch ?
well , it might have , yeah .
but who said girl push ups don' t count ?
yeah , who said girl push ups don' t count ?
how you want to pay me , cash or check ?
oh , look at them arms starting to shake .
come on .
come on .
aah !
oof !
okay , stan , now you ready to get started for real ?
man , what type of shit is this ?
hydrostatic weighing .
it' s how we determine how much body fat you really have .
i don' t need my balls washed to tell you how much i weigh .
hold your breath , stan .
this ain' t nothin ' but a southern baptism .
it' s called modern technology , stan .
recently , the brewers have incorporated new methods of training into their exercise regimen .
we' re gonna get you started on this bad boy .
look at this .
mm hmm .
this looks like some punishment .
actually , it' s very gentle .
it' s called pilates .
pi what ?
breathe in .
okay , feel the extensors now .
i feel like flipper .
b , that' s what i' m talkin ' about .
i' m gonna start off real light , about 463 .
you can throw 463 on if you want to , chicken chest , but your equipment is right over there .
remember what i told you .
keep that ass up .
all right , push !
whoa , where you going ?
is this a joke ?
it' s only a joke if you think weak abs are funny .
feel it in your lats ?
you ask me about my lats .
yeah , i feel it .
my spine and my butt , too .
push it !
push it !
push it !
come on !
aah !
# it' s fun to stay at the y. m. c. a. #

# you can get yourself clean , you can have a good meal #
# you can do whatever ... #
so , tomorrow , man , you ready ?
game' s changed a lot since we last played .
i still see the ball .
i still hit the ball .
all day .
but i do miss playin ' .
i know i always said i didn' t , but i do .
ain' t nothin ' like hittin ' in the major leagues .
bein ' a part of that great tradition .
i never felt that type of respect that i felt on the ball field .
that kind of attention .
oh , shoot , that reminds me .
you got a call this afternoon .
some ad agency guy from new york .
endorsement ?
was it reebok ?
it' s not reebok .
adidas or nike ?
viagra .
what ?
viagra , man .
you' d be the spokesman .
i ain' t gonna be no damn spokesman for no viagra .
i can still swing my bat , bo .
are we ready to roll here ?
okay , the milwaukee brewers are pleased to be able to help a member of the brewer family reclaim his rightful place in baseball history .
so it is with great pride that i introduce to you the once and future mr. 3000 , stan ross .
thank you .
thank you , mr. schembri , and the milwaukee brewers organization .
and i promise , it won' t be like last time when i' m in front of the microphone with all that cussin ' and shit , you know ?
hey , stan .
yes ?
is this only about getting back to 3, 000 hits , or do you believe you can help make the brewers more competitive on the field ?
how could i not make them more competitive ?
let me be a little polite here .
the milwaukee brewers are weak .
here we go .
who they got ?
they' re a little league team .
you all know it .
they need me .
how do you think you' il adjust to the contemporary game ?
you ever heard of harold melvin & the blue notes ?
earth , wind & fire ?
some things just always play well .
a little " old school " is what this team needs .
you nervous ?
what if you don' t hit ?
what' s that ?
i said , " what if you don' t hit ?
if all this talk is just talk and it becomes obvious you' re hurting the team , will you take yourself out of the lineup ?
i said i' m gonna hit .
when i say i' m gonna do something , i do it .
that' s not always how it works .
well , it is for me .
not the way i remember .
maybe you remember something you thought i said i was gonna do , but didn' t say i was gonna do it ,
' cause i cold blood do everything i say i' m gonna do .
is that the way you were raised ?
straight up and down , like 6 : 00 .
so what does your mama think about this comeback foolishness ?
why are we getting on this mama stuff ?
okay , that' s it for today , folks .
thank you very much .
just get one more question .
get in line .
you really nailed him on that one .
maureen .
hey .

what do you think ?
i' m covering the story for espn .
uh huh .
why you , though ?
they sent me .
just by chance , you ain' t here to see me ?

they asked me to cover a story , so i' m covering it , period .
i' il see you at the ball park .
mo , mo , mo , mo .
wait , wait .
how about an exclusive ?

you and me ?
huh ?
you think you' il get three hits in your first three at bats and get this thing over with ?
come on , mo , i' m 47 years old .

you' re one of a kind , stan ross .
thank you for sitting with us .
good luck tonight .
thank you .
that' s it .
thanks , guys .
that' s a wrap .
that wasn' t too bad , was it ?

mr. ross .

that' s your locker over there .
the arizona diamondbacks and the milwaukee brewers .
go ahead , man , it' s in my locker .

i know very well who you are .
i grew up watching your excellent play on television .
you are hero to many young japanese players .
but you have hole in your ass .
hole in my ass ?
what' s his problem ?
that' s fukuda .
he was taught english in school in japan , but they never taught him to cuss worth a damn .
but why he cuss me out ?
i never did nothin ' to him .
brother , you' re looking at 25 little leaguers in here who want to give you an ass whupping .
oh , 6 3 !
6 3 , man !
6 4 .
you' re right , 6 4 .
i was trying to cheat .

grandpa ?

ah , yes !
now batting leadoff .
skills that pay the bills .
whoo !

yeah , he was here .
i don' t think i was one of his favorites .
stan ross , you bat eighth !
ha ha !
eighth ?
that' s for banjo hitters .
man , i never batted lower than fifth in my life .
you bat that now , you son of my dick .
son of my dick ?
hey , what size you swinging over there , old school ?
34 ounce , like i always have .
you sure you can still get around with that at your age ?
don' t you worry about me .
i' ve been swinging this thing sweet before you knew which side of the bat was the good end .
whoo !
yeah , i swing a 36 myself .
yeah , that' s big talk .
i got a hammer my damn self .
whew .
come on , coach .
ross , you suck !
how' s it feel , stan ?
how about an interview after the game ?
come on , now , don' t distract me when i' m hittin ' .
hitting' s my business .
that' s what i' m talkin ' about .
lookin ' good , stan .
stan !
still the wizard of wood !
bingo .
oh , yeah .
i' m about to take care of business .
charge !
charge !
charge !
bottom of the third , and the cheers you hear , and the boos , for that matter , are for stan ross .
it' s the reason most of the 38, 000 plus fans are here tonight .
first baseman , number 21 , stan ross .
this guy throws pretty hard , pops .
is that right ?
well , i hit pretty hard , son .
strike one .
come on , stan .
be aggressive .
i am .
stay focused .
keep your eye on the ball .
i' m looking dead at it .
i don' t need you to tell me what to do .
come on in .
i' ve been here before .
this ain' t my first picnic , baby .
ooh , stan was a hair off timing that big breaking ball from hamilton .
of course , all season , a lot of hitters , who aren' t 47 years old , have been fooled by hamilton .
and we' re the little leaguers ?
not so aggressive , baby .
whew .
focus .
he playin ' to you .
let him play to you , baby .
come on .
come on , stan .
come on , baby .
strike !
inside fastball , and stan ross is out of there on three straight pitches .
it looks like it could be a long night for the king of swing .
what up ?
welcome to " sportscenter .
stuart scott with you .
we got some more baseball .
braves at brewers .
who cares ?
well , stan ross cares .
the first week at bat was a lot like the first week out of the womb for stan .
a lot of drooling and a lot of just flailing around for the erstwhile king of swing .
let' s check out the highlights .
well , stan the man more like stan the statue , just chillin ' at a curve for strike one .
next pitch .
now , wait a second .
what was it that stan said about the rest of his team ?
the milwaukee brewers are weak .
who they got ?
they' re a little league team .
they need me .
uh huh .
little leaguers , huh ?
well , my 9 year old has a better swing and better eyes than that .
oh !
just chillin ' at a called strike three , and , well , that' il get you some halitosis action .
yeah , when you get just a little too close to the umpire .
stan' s not done .
he decided to do a little spring cleaning .
either that , or he just wants to symbolize how well he' s been playing .
yeah , garbage !
now , i' m not gonna say that every brewer but stan had a hit , but i am gonna say that every brewer but stan that played had a hit .
our maureen simmons was at the game and had postgame duty .
not the day stan ross or the milwaukee fans had in mind .
word around the organization is that manager gus panas is particularly unhappy having ross back in the lineup .
apparently he hasn' t forgotten the way stan abandoned the team in the middle of the pennant race nine years ago .
stuart .
the press is having a field day .
hey , they' re just getting even with stan for all those years of abuse .
for turning this team into a laughingstock .
five games and hasn' t gotten close to a hit .
how long do we let this go on ?
we got 35, 000 people in the park today .
we' re committed to this .
whether stan ross ever gets another hit or not .
you sure you don' t want anything stronger than club soda ?
oh , no , i' m good .
thanks , boca .
why you call him boca ?
look at him .
he look like he' s ready for boca raton with them tracksuits .
stan don' t appreciate my velour .
that' s all he wears .
mo , i swear , he has a black one for funerals .
just comin ' from me , i think my man take his old reebok endorsement deal a little too serious .
hey , a lifetime supply .
that' s why i love you .
no , that' s why i love you .
no , i love you more .
no , i love you more .
no , no , i started the love .
and your life' s been richer ever since .
i hear you .
nice to see you again , mo .
mm , you too , tony .
so , you hire a fancy decorator to help you do this place ?
girl , you need to quit fightin ' .
you know doggone well you thought i was gonna be old and tired when i quit the game .
i never thought about it .
you thought it .
but i got news for you .
i own this place , and i own all the stores next door .
3000 suds , 3000 woks , and 3000 beeps .
that' s why you' re comin ' back .
so all them names make sense .
sister , you know why i' m comin ' back .
' cause i deserve to be in the hall of fame with the immortals .
you know , you really shouldn' t word it like that .
is that right ?
mm hmm .
what ?
oh , you know what .
you better hush .
you eatin ' that steak .
let me see something .
come here .
flex .
mnh mnh .
mo , mo , baby , look at you .
come on , mo .
look at you , mo .
oho !
and quick still .
you gonna eat this ?
you sure got time to eat .
baby , you hungrier than a hostage .
ooh , take a bite out of crime .
that killed me there , i' il tell ya .
i thought the lady must have ...
wait a minute .
wait , wait , wait .
you don' t train no more .
you don' t drink no more .
what' s up with that ?
' cause i remember you used to drink half the american league underneath the table .
i realized i had to start cuttin ' loose from those things that weren' t getting me anywhere .
where you need to be gettin ' ?
on with my life .
we don' t stay young forever .
come on .
you know we' re young enough .
ooh , i don' t think so , mr. ross .
come on , i know you remember what it was like .
you can' t say we didn' t have something special .
good night .
what about kansas city ?
that was a mind blowing weekend .
you mean to tell me you forgot about that ?
bye bye .
cleveland , when i had your toenails poppin ' off like redenbacher .
bye .
come on , how about toronto ?
god .
uh huh .
oh .
come on , say it .
come on , now .
you know i didn' t expect you in toronto .
you know how those canadian groupies are .
come on , now .
you know what ?
don' t give me that crap .
you' re a selfish man .
you always were .
okay , if you so upset , why was you willing to get back with me ?
we got together for a night , but i didn' t stay for breakfast , did i ?
we' d still be doin ' it if you didn' t take that espn gig .
when there' s a better offer on the table , you gotta take it .
i' il pay for it .
bye bye .
the count is 1 1 on the second baseman minadeo .
brewers down by 4 .
runner at first .
they sure could use a little spark here .
glickman now on the mound , working from the stretch .
throws to first and picked him off .
skillett is caught napping .
when is this ball club going to wake up ?
another mistake .
minadeo steps back in .
here' s the wind and the pitch .
swung on , a one hopper back to the mound .
he bobbles it , but what' s minadeo doing ?
he' s not running .
now they pick it up .
the throw to first , and he' s out .
aah !
come on !
look at that .
there should be a man on first and second right now .
but easy , gus .
don' t get excited .
i don' t want you to pop no blood vessel .
what you all havin ' , prayer ?
the only shining star on the team these days is their strapping young outfielder , t rex pennebaker .
but even his impressive power numbers have done little to stop the brewers ' losing streak .
pennebaker digs in .
and here' s the windup and the pitch .
swung on and a deep , deep drive to left field .
it' s going , going .
it is gone !
4 1 .
yet another bases empty home run for t rex pennebaker .
what the hell is that ?
that right there ?
that' s a little somethin ' for " sportscenter .
plus , that' s gonna look tight in next year' s video game .
what the hell you call yourself doin ' ?
yo , i' m puttin ' the show in the show .
but your team losin ' .
instead of playin ' , you makin ' like mr. bojangles .
i just hit a home run , son .
maybe you was takin ' a grandpa nap during that part .
but your team gettin ' picked off .
your boys ain' t beatin ' out grounders .
there should' ve been two men on when you hit that homer .
it should be a ball game right now .
so yell at them , old school .
get up out of my face .
i did my job .
you the superstar .
you set the tone .
listen here .
when you get a base hit in this millennium , then you can come on down there and talk to me .
is that right ?
yeah , that' s right .
hey , stan , you think that diaper' s affecting your swing ?
maybe you should use something lighter .
how about a wiffle bat ?
how ' bout i shove my hall of fame bat up the crack of your mascot ass ?
make you a hot dog on a stick , bitch .
yeah ?
i might be a sausage with teeth , but you sure as hell ain' t no hall of famer .
# if you disrespect # what ?
# everybody that you run into #
looks familiar ?
familiar ?
you ain' t changed nothin ' since back in the day .
in fact , i don' t think you even vacuumed .
well , why mess with perfection ?
oh , i can think of a lot of descriptions for this couch , and " perfection " ain' t one of ' em .
what' s the deal there ?
how come i hardly see you on " sportscenter " anymore ?
you know .
they got some pretty young thing they tryin ' to groom .
that' s bull .
they can' t treat you like that .
i remember once upon a time i pushed out the 40 year old .
i been playin ' this game long enough to know how it goes .
but i' ve been lookin ' ahead toward it , you know ?
i' m gonna start producing next year .
i' m goin ' behind the camera .
oh , you go , girl .
like i' ve been telling you , you can' t beat father time .
well , how come you really haven' t settled down ?
the right man wasn' t right .
# i' ve been really trying , baby #
what' s the matter with you ?
that' s my song .
# trying to hold back this feeling for so long #
come on , bump with me .
don' t leave me hangin ' .
come on .
i need you , now .
don' t leave me hangin ' .
come on .
come on .
come on out here .
all right , only ' cause i like this song , too .
not ' cause i like you .
i' il take it . # whoo , let' s get it on # come on .
# oh , baby #
# let' s get it on #
hey . # let' s love , baby #
# let' s get it on #

stan .
yeah , baby ?
honey , stop chasing the butt .
you know what , mo ?
the best sex i ever had was with you .
what ?
yeah .
you had girls in every city in baseball .
it wasn' t the best .
why is that ?
we do it longer ?
not really .
more positions , then ?
i ain' t goin ' there .
mm hmm .
more times a night ?
oh , you still hold the record .
i don' t know , baby .
i guess i like the rest of it .
the rest of it ?
what' s left ?
well , you know .
i like the sleepin ' and the talkin ' and hangin ' out and stuff like that .
# giving yourself to me #
# can never be wrong # but that' s not sex .
it is to me .
no , it' s not sex .
what you call that , then ?
# ooh ooh #
# now , don' t you know #
# how sweet and wonderful life can be ? #
# ooh ooh #
# i' m asking you #
before we go too far , i can' t spend the night .
why not ?
early flight .
where you got to go ?
i got three games before we go on the road .
but i got to get back .
you got to get ...
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
are you givin ' up on me , mo ?
what you got to say ?
i don' t have a say .
i just go where i' m assigned .
you tell ' em i' m startin ' to swing the bat good again ?
i' m just a reporter .
i don' t make the news or decide what is the news .
you' re givin ' up on me , too .
mnh mnh .
you just got to make the news , baby .
start hittin ' that ball .
come on .
what ?
come on .
you want to go up ?
stay down ?
what ?
no .
i' m not in the mood right now .
you ...
you' re kiddin ' .
you' re not in the mood ?
no .
oh , come on , baby .
no , i got a headache .
really ?
you gonna tell me you got cramps , too ?
maybe .
you know ...
whatever .
all right , now .
i' m leavin ' .
lord , just when i thought i' d seen it all .
when you get a base hit in this millennium , then you can come on down ...
i can still swing my bat .
you think you' il get three hits in your first three at bats ?
more like stan the statue .
when you get a base hit ...
you just got to make the news , baby .
start hittin ' that ball .
one , two , three strikes , you' re out !
oh , bat boy .
ooh , ooh , a little testy .
a little testy .
anybody have a stan ross rookie card ?
quite valuable .
if you look on the back , you' il see it' s written in latin .
you see , very old .
very old card .
it' s on parchment .
he' s now 0 27 in his comeback .
at what point , peter , does the rust come off ?
i' m not sure it does .
remember , jim palmer tried to come back after he was in the hall of fame , and he kept himself in better shape than ross .
why does the media hate this guy so much ?
he' s a jerk .
because t rex is the best in power and performance .
find it at radio shack .
radio shack .
you' ve got questions .
we' ve got answers .
' cause i want my hits that got stolen from me .
those hits are my ticket to the hall of fame .
he' s not going to the hall of fame !
you think three hits are keeping you out ?
3, 000 hits , baby , it' s automatic .
look at me .
you' re 47 years old .
you' re fat .
you' re out of shape .
favorite portion of the show , the comedy portion .
i' m gonna say it here , the woman that puts on the sausage outfit that races around miller park has got a better chance of getting a hit than stan ross .
that' s not fair , tom .
he' s a black athlete .
black athletes age slower .
george foreman didn' t know when to get out .
mike tyson didn' t know when to get out .
michael jordan struggled , and he was only out two years .
this guy hasn' t played since i was married to my first wife .
it just isn' t possible to get out of his day .
he' s a bad teammate .
stan ross was a great athlete .
stan is all about stan .
the brewers knew what they were getting into .
it' s a publicity stunt , just like when the white sox hired that midget .
tom , you can' t say " midget .
he' s small .
that guy was small for a friggin ' midget .
it' s like if the red sox thawed out ted williams , although he' d hit better than stan .
listen , stan' s playing like he' s frozen .
stan is embarrassing .
he' s embarrassing me .
he' s embarrassing him .
he should give it up .
but when an athlete gets to that point , he loses all his pride .
yeah , you' re making me cry .
i don' t think he' s embarrassed .
i think he' s having a party at his place , got bitches all around and counting all his money .
i don' t think stan cares .
wrong !
he' s embarrassed .
he used to be able to hit , cannot hit now .
very embarrassing , especially with all the bitches he got around .
hey , boca .
you think i should quit ?
do your thing , man .
you think ?
i' m just saying .
yeah , you' re right .
i got three home games against the astros before we go on the road .
i' m gonna play those games , and that' s it .
if i don' t get a hit , it' s over .
i' m not goin ' on the road .
what you think , boca ?
do your thing , man .
you think ?
i' m just saying .
yeah .
you' re right .
you want to get married ?
you the only one that love me .
i' m serious .
i' ve been waitin ' 20 years for you to ask me that .
and now that you have , i don' t know .
yeah , you right .
okay , erica kane .
dog , come on .
all my children .
you need to step up the degree of difficulty , brother .
asa buchanan .
that' s abc , right ?
i ain' t telling you nothing .
oh !
one life to live .
yeah .
okay , i got one .
come on .
don roberto .
don roberto .
oh , that' s the dude with the cologne .
guiding light .
what ?
wrong !
it' s " amigas y rivales .
no , we' re not doing spanish shows , man .
i don' t know what you' re saying .
what the hell they doing ?
seeing who can name the soaps .
you known me for two years .
have i ever spoke spanish ?
hey .
why don' t you have a contest guessin ' which team losin ' ?
stupid .
come on , stan .
get a hit , grandpa .
strike !
charge !
come on , brewers !
oh !
strike three !
he tucks his arm in on the curve .
number 21 , stan ross .
out !
you see that ?
hey , skillett !
you see that ?
i was all over that nickel curve ball .
looked like a groundout to me .
say what , partner ?
i said , " it looked like a groundout to me .
you don' t see it .
he tipped his pitch , and i called it .
koron , how long has this pitcher been in the league ?
two years .
two years , man !
he' s showin ' his pitch , and he don' t know it .
watch his right arm .
his elbow go in like this .
he grip the ball .
he throwin ' a curve ball .
dip , grip , curve ball .
come on , man !
skillett !
come on , baby !
come on !
runners lead away , and fukuda working from the stretch .
the pitch , and a swing and a solid line drive single to left field .
and another run scores .
the astros in a position now to break this game wide open .
hey !
you okay ?
i don' t want panas to take me out .
i had a few bad outings in a row , and if i don' t get my face out my ass and get out this inning ,
i know the team is going to give me the shoe .
give you the shoe ?
yeah , the shoe .
look , don' t be thinkin ' negative out here , okay ?
just keep the ball low and away .
we' il get you out the inning .
then i' m gonna work on your cussin ' .
come on .
let' s go , baby .
let' s go .
shortstop , number 3 , cecil gervis .
gervis , with a 6 game hitting streak , at the plate .
fukuda checks his sign .
the right hander from the stretch , checks the runners now , and here' s the pitch .
a big swing and a slow roller towards short .
skillett charges .
his only play is to first .
he' s safe .
the bases are loaded .
and ross is hot .
that' s the third out !
that' s the third damn out !
ray charles could' ve called that call !
last warning .
damn you , man !
be with me .
just be with me .
come on , let' s go .
let' s go !
two out !
i don' t know why i bothered comin ' back .
you can' t play .
you definitely can' t ump .
you need to relax before you pop a valve .
you need to sit your ass down .
yeah ?
why' s that ?
because you out !
he' s out !
right here .
right here , baby !
grab some , bitch !
# whoomp , there it is ! #
# whoomp , there it is ! #

t rex .
it' s the 31st time you' ve homered but your team' s lost .
does that get to you ?
my team lost , huh ?
you know what , man ?
this ain' t my team .
if this was my team , these fools would be hittin ' home runs like i' m hittin ' .
and they' d be stealin ' bases like i' m out there stealin ' .
i' m the only one out there gettin ' mine .
what the rest of these fools doin ' ?
they ain' t doin ' crap !

but you didn' t catch the real story on tonight' s game .
no , come here .
let me ask you a question .
move it over there .
when was the last time you saw a 47 year old man end an inning with the hidden ball trick , huh ?
is that the first time you pulled that off in a game ?
are the brewers goin ' to the world series ?
it was 1989 , against the mariners .
yo , t rex .

you know why i stepped in tonight with them reporters ?
yeah .
you can' t stand to see another brother gettin ' some attention .

yeah , man , that' s what i think .
let me tell you something .
you keep talking about your teammates the way you do , boastin ' about yourself , you' re gonna end up all by yourself .
all alone and empty , like you are right now .
you know what' s gonna happen ?
they' re gonna retire your number someday , and big horse berelli gonna be standin ' up there with you .
yeah ?
who the hell is big horse berelli ?
that' s my point exactly .
nice car .

when i was a kid on south side chicago , we used to play baseball when we got out of school till it got dark , when you couldn' t see your hand in front of your face .

you looked like a champion out there .
let me paint you a picture .
go ahead .
miller park , standing room only .
got that ?
i got it .
43, 000 screaming fans , and they' re there for one reason and one reason only .
to watch the legendary stan ross step to the plate and dig in .
shoot , that ain' t no picture .
that' s a damn rembrandt .
i agree , and that' s why i' m telling gus not to play you on the road .
hold on , man .
chill out , baby .
what are you talking about ?
man , we' re on a roll .
we' re going for third place .
you' re one hit away from making history , stan .
don' t you think you owe it to the fans to do it here at home ?
hmm ?
i don' t know .
you' re takin ' half my at bats away .
although i hit a home run , i' m still 2 for 51 .
2 for 58 !
# stan ross is at the plate , the fans , they sit and wait #
look , what i' m sayin ' is , don' t cut me out .
the team need me .
come on , now .
stan , you heard the sausage .
you' re 2 for 58 .
the team doesn' t need you to get third place .
they' re on fire !
come on , let' s face it .
but you , my friend , you have got to start thinking about life after baseball .
i' m talking endorsements , product lines .
a stan ross candy bar .
i want you doing press all week long on the road , stan .
you pull this off , nothing' s gonna keep you out of the hall of fame .
you' re a champion .
hey , stan , tom arnold here .
congratulations on everything .
the team' s on a tear .
you won seven in a row .
you guys could finish third .
are you really talking to us from the clubhouse ?
well , they' re not gonna play me until i come home , so i might as well do something else with my time .
stan , how does it feel not to be playing right now ?
it don' t feel good , especially the way i' ve been swinging , but that' s skip' s decision .
i have to go with it because , as you say , we got a chance to make third place .
and they were in fifth place when you got there .
i finally got them playin ' patented stan ross baseball .
okay , stan .
stan ross , at 47 , the oldest man to homer in the major leagues .
how' s it feel ?
to tell you the truth , we never thought you could do it , and some of us hoped you wouldn' t , so we owe you an apology big time .
well , it takes a big man to admit when he wrong , but like my teammate kenji fukuda taught me to say ...
what the hell is he talking about ?
stan .
what does the future hold ?
yeah , stan .
what about number 3, 000 ?
what game are you gonna get this hit in ?
i think i' m gonna get it on the next at bat .
you got another homer left in you ?
keep your popcorn by your side ' cause it' s comin ' .
stan ross .
is it gonna be a home run ?
the faster you throw it in , the quicker it' s goin ' out .
hey , stan .
i hope you weren' t listening to the trash we were talking about you before you hit your groove .
tom , you wouldn' t be where you are if it wasn' t for roseanne .
you know what ?
that would have hurt if it wasn' t true .
stan ross .
stan ross .
stan ross .
hey , girl , you been watchin ' ?
the whole world loves me again , baby .
stan ross , the king of swing .
sweetheart , i' m goin ' national .
you know , you' re starting to sound like the old stan .

like walter johnson and christy mathewson , and that candy ass cy young .
well , you draw up the plans .
you got a call an hour ago from " the tonight show .
they want you on there tomorrow .
i' m on a roll , man .
i' m tellin ' you .
that' s big time exposure .
here' s the hook .
they want you at the studio at 9 : 00 .
that' s cool .
but you got that extra practice .
that' s one practice .
one practice .
i' m talking about jay leno .
that' s bigger than the game .
stan ross , come on out here !
what' s up ?
what' s up , baby ?
all on , baby .
have a seat .
all right .
team brewer is on a roll , making a push for third place .
ha ha , baby , i' m on a roll , too , jay .
i' m on a roll , too .
i' m sure to stay on that roll , what , are you taking the ensure every day ?
is it once a day ?
and then you have a sensible meal for dinner .
i can do anything a 20 year old can do .
any doggone thing , baby .
anything , huh ?
show you right .
show you right .
and i can do it all night .
dave ?
yeah , there' s a large black man hitting on your wife .
yeah , show you right .
what' s next ?
i started my own little stuff right here .
check this out .
look at that .
my own little candy .
" ross bar .
get a shot of that one .
that is the most ratty ass candy bar i' ve ever seen .
it' s a piece of loose leaf paper you wrote " ross bar " on .
it' s a prototype .
oh , the prototype .
you gotta start somewhere .
you know , i' m an entrepreneur .
once you get over the initial modesty , i think you' il be fine .
you talkin ' to the ladies ' pet the men regret .
i' m stan ross .
what' s my name , baby ?
stan ross !
they call me what ?
the boss !
because i ...
pay the cost !
because i' m ...
stan ross !
turn it up , baby !
stan ross .
be right back right after this .
don' t go away .
yes , sir .
boca !
yo , bo !
did you see me , baby ?
ha ha .
jay and i did our thing .
that ain' t no espn .
i' m talkin ' big time .
hey .
hey , baby .
don' t you " baby " me .
i went to the park this morning , and you weren' t there .
your entire team was there , and you' re a no show .
well , i mean ...
well ? " didn' t you call for the practice ?
besides letting down your teammates , you told me i could interview you .
well , interview me now .
come on , turn the camera on .
it' s not like i' m hiding from you .
i' il come right around .
that ain' t nothin ' .
shoot .
come on , baby .
all right , forget this .
i' il freestyle it .
mark , steve , are you ready ?
you didn' t ask if i' m ready .
you always ready .
let me get on that side .
you can see the balls .
it looks better .
hey , how you doin ' ?
all right .
good .
come on , baby .
i' m here with hall of famer hopeful stan ross , who is now just one hit from reclaiming his cherished 3, 000 career hits .
but let' s talk about the name " mr. 3000 .
fit just right , doesn' t it ?
why is there so much emphasis on the name ?
why do you care so much about it ?
because it identifies greatness .
when you think of mr. 3000 , you think of mr. stan ross , one of the greatest hitters straight up and down .
who were you before mr. 3000 ?
mr. 3000 .
i' m just kidding .
before that , i was a young black kid on the south side of chicago , stanley ross , playin ' baseball .
what does stanley ross think of mr. 3000 ?
he wants his autograph .
really ?
really .
what about your teammates ?
they don' t need it .
they get the chance to see history in the making .
oh , okay .
so what you' re saying is , your teammates get to see your 3, 000th hit , but not potentially move into third place ?
what i' m saying is , thousands of people bought tickets this weekend , not to see us play for third place , but to see me get my hit .
really ?
damn right .
it' s the same reason why everybody else here .
same reason why you here , unless you' re here for something else .
oh , okay .
you selfish son of a bitch !
you don' t want that on camera .
no , i' m fine .
because i' m not the one who' s desperate to live his entire life in front of the camera .
tell them about toronto and the history you left there .
that' s so old .
your damn ego is so old !
it hasn' t changed , stan .
i mean , how am i supposed to think about moving here when you can' t do what you say you' re gonna do ?
mo , it' s only one damn practice , baby .
you know it' s bigger than one practice , stan .
but you' re right .
i am here to record your history in the making .
and it' s the same as it ever was .
mo .
you gonna run after her ?
no .
i' il catch her later .
i got ball games to play .
what ?
whew .
what ?
no , i' m just saying , man , that' s why i love you , man .
wait a minute .
what do you mean ?
i' m just saying that i could always count on you to do your thing , you know ?
you' re consistent .
you' re always driven .
and you' re always for yourself .
you sayin ' that' s a good thing ?
i' m just saying .
# come on ! #
just two weeks ago , fans , the milwaukee brewers seemed willing to accept their perennial position in the division cellar .
is it more than a coincidence that their solid defense and clutch hitting started with stan ross ' 2, 998th hit ?
while ross was just a spectator during their last road trip ,
t rex pennebaker has emerged as the team leader .
we' ve all witnessed the mounting frustration for ross , who has gone hitless in the first two games against the astros in this , his final home stand .
you can' t help but wonder what' s going through his mind as ross ' window of opportunity to join that elite 3, 000 hit club is about to close and close before a nationwide audience .
so , here we are .
the stage is set .
a re energized team plays for respectability , while stan ross knocks on the door of baseball greatness .
tonight , 35, 000 fans witness as history unfolds over nine innings of brewers baseball .
last chance to go out there and get yours .
we have a lineup change tonight .
in hopes of squeezing out an extra at bat for ross , he' s hitting cleanup right behind rex pennebaker .
now batting , first baseman , number 21 ,
stan ross !
this big crowd is charged tonight .
the right hander norton , one of the most competitive pitchers in the league , will do everything he can to avoid being a footnote in baseball history .
one game , one more hit , and he has that magical 3, 000 .
ball .
they' re on their feet , rooting for ross to get ahold of one , as norton gets his sign .
ross puts a good swing on it .
it' s deep to right field and carrying well .
damn .
yo , ross !
why don' t you take a seat ?
you ain' t gettin ' that hit off me tonight !
deal with it !
this guy' s slider sucks .
come on , man .
i guess somebody should have showed up to that practice .
home half of the fourth .
it' s still a scoreless tie .
this crowd ripe with anticipation every time ross steps to the plate .
ross swings .
a sharp ground ball up the middle .
second baseman gomez with a diving stop .
he scrambles .
it' s gonna be close .
he' s out !
oh , my , what a close play !
from our angle , i thought he was safe .
you' re wrong !
i' m surprised stan ross isn' t protesting the call .
that man was safe !
that man was out .
what game are you watching ?
i called the man out .
i' m watching the same game you are !
we are playing for third place !
the man was out !
don' t make me run you , gus .
you got your head so far up your ass , you didn' t see the play !
head up my ass ?
that' s right !
head up your ass !
that' s what i said !
that' s it !
you' re outta here !
you' re outta here !
let me tell you something !
get off of my field !
you' re the worst umpire in this whole league !
outta here !
you' re such a jerk !
the man was safe !
the guy' s out !
he was safe !
walk him off the field !
get him off my field !
you were safe !
you were safe !
you were beautiful .
come on , tiger .
he was safe !
so it boils down to the bottom of the ninth inning .
still scoreless here in the final game of the season .
mr. 2999 " very likely will be making his last plate appearance of a storied big league career .
but first the man who' s become sort of ross ' protege of late ,
t rex pennebaker .
we' ve got an interesting situation here , fans .
if pennebaker homers , that' s the game , and ross won' t get another shot .
go , t !
come on , baby !
come on , baby .
get on .
i' il bring you home .
come on , get on , baby .
just get on .
and that ball is crushed .
a line drive to deep left center .
it' s going , going .
it is off the base of the wall .
pennebaker rounds first , heading for second .
and he is safe with a ringing double .
oh , man !
he almost took the bat right out of stan ross ' hands .
but now ross is up with not only a chance for his 3, 000th base hit and a call from cooperstown , but an opportunity to drive in the winning run and end the brewers ' season on a high note .
3, 000 , baby !
all right .
come on .
ball .
pitch to him .
let' s go , man .
get your hit .
ball .
pitch to me , damn it !
reach out there and get it , then .
reach out and get it .
those first two deliveries , way outside .
ross now crowding the plate .
2 balls , no strikes .
nothing close from norton .
i' m right here !
here we go .
this is it .
3 0 , the count .
this crowd roaring , begging norton to challenge ross with a decent pitch .
i could always count on you to do your thing , you know ?
you' re consistent .
you' re always driven .
and you' re always for yourself .
that' s why i love you .
look at this !
ross lays a sacrifice bunt up the first base line , and t rex isn' t stopping at third .
here' s a throw to first base , and ross is out .
here comes the play .
the slide , the tag .
he is safe !
he is safe !
the brewers win !
the brewers win !
# we' re movin ' #
# groovin ' #
# ain' t no stopping us now #
# groovin ' #

stan !
stan !
stan !
stan !
corny enough for you ?
well , it gets worse .
first off , now all of a sudden , the press loves me .
took ' em long enough , though , huh ?
the hall of fame voted me in on the very next ballot .
and as you can imagine , i had plenty of people to thank .
and old mo .
she decided to move back to milwaukee after all .
i know she said i' d never get serious , but these days , i' m even thinkin ' about gettin ' married .
you know , so i can have that great sex all the time .
and hot damn , if boca didn' t just up and move to boca .
i can see him right now , helping some lost soul , sayin ' ,
" do your thing .
do your thing .
and me , i retired again , like you probably figured .
but i didn' t want to go out without leavin ' the fellas a little somethin ' to remember me by .
even though i left the game ,
i couldn' t stay too far from it , so i bought me that song .
# out of the tree of life #
# i just picked me a plum #
and that' s the whole story .
like my baby mo says ,
it' s all about figurin ' out who you are .
and some of that' s just a matter of gettin ' a little older and acceptin ' it .
and i can deal with that .
just ' cause i' m retired don' t mean i' m invisible .
in fact , i' m guessin ' you' ve probably seen my commercial once or twice yourself .
# the best is yet to come #
# and , babe , won' t it be fine ? #
# you think you' ve seen the sun #
# but you ain' t seen it shine #
# wait till the warm up' s underway #
# wait till our lips have met #
# wait till you see that sunshiny day #
# you ain' t seen nothin ' yet #

# wait till you' re locked in my embrace #
