i have to hang mirror ball .
you little snottynosed runts .
i know exactly where you are .
you messing with nick the quick , baby .

hit yourself over the head with a brick ... ... and say that they were kidnapped .
shut up .
happy new year .
you think nick' s okay ?
what are you worried about him for ?
i' m not .
it' s just ... ... maybe we were a little rough .
oh , please .
that player got what he deserved .
get your butts on this horse .
you got $400 ?
i' ve been thinking .
we should' ve brought soup or something .
what for ?
because dad' s sick .
what is he gonna eat ?
he' s a dad .
i' m sure he has soup .
he must be lonely , living all by himself .
look , don' t bug him about that .
lf we want him to hook up with mom , we have to be subtle .
got it ?
i got it .
come on , y' all .
let' s get out of here .
want some chocolate cake ?
it' s worldfamous .
mom says i shouldn' t have sugar .
what about you ?
it' il make your mouth all chocolatey .
no , thanks .
hey .
you forgot something .
sorry about what happened today .
i really wish you guys didn' t have to see that .
he used to look at me like that .
i know , man .
and when he hugged you , you thought he' d never let you go .
they make you laugh , they tell you they love you ... ... then one day , they never come back .
i bet you know all about leaving , don' t you , player ?
know what ?
as a matter of fact , i do .
but only because the same thing happened to me when i was your age .
yeah , my pops walked out on us too .
it' s a shame that anybody can call theyself a father .
but listen ... ... he' s the failure in this , not you .
he' s the one that' s gonna miss out .
i just hope it don' t take you guys as long as it took me to figure that out ... ... because it' s true .
you guys are some cool kids .
there you go .
come on , let' s get out of here .
nick ?
what' s up , little man ?
lf my dad left and your dad left ... ... does that mean i' il end up like you ?
i ain' t doing too bad .
look , i have blingage .
that' s not exactly what i meant .
l was watching oprah , and it was all about how depressed and lonely ... ... bachelors like you are .
but i' m not depressed or lonely .
yes , you are .
no , i' m not .
yes , you are .
no , i' m not .
mom says that if a man is not married by the time he' s 35 ... ... he' s either damaged or gay .
what ?
well , that would explain those earrings .
watch it , sucker .
but you do have intimacy issues , don' t you ?
no , i don' t .
yes , you do .
no , i don' t .
yes , you do .
look , it' s obvious you need a timeout ... ... and you need a little tickle time .
because all you do is ask a thousand questions , huh ?
hey .
are you all right ?
kevin .
i' m good .
you sure ?
yeah , except ... ... l' m out .
okay , don' t worry about that .
we' il get you more once we get there .
oh , sure , we can wait ... ... if you want me to die !

he' s off duty .
and i doubt very much he' s gonna want some guy interrupting his holi
just a second , sir , and i' il draw you up a map .
hey , nick , that guy was such a meanie .
how' d you get him to do what you wanted ?
oh , that was simple .
i just gave him the look .
it works every time .
it even worked through glass ?
oh , yeah .
the look is something i developed when i was a kid .
i had somewhat of a reputation .
surprise , surprise .
i don' t want everybody stepping to me , so i give them the look ... ... which told them , " back off .
that' s a bad mother " " shut your mouth .
i wish i could do that .
you got somebody bothering you at school ?
an asthmatic in the accelerated program ?
what do you think ?
try this .
it' s foolproof .
no , no , check the lip , check the lip .

yo .
give me my shoe .
yo .
excuse me , are you the pharmacist ?
not at the moment .
why ?
well , look , i got a kid with me , man .

that usually helps .
hey , hey .
knock it off .
steam ?
that' s enough of that .
look , look , all i need is a refill , okay ?
and i know you can help .
i' m asking you nice .
mister , i' ve been married for 38 years .
you can' t scare me .
come on , man , you the pharmacist .
i know you took a oath or something .
not that i can remember , no .
hey , will you go over there and behave yourself ?
yeah , go get him over there .
