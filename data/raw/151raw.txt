500 years had passed , and still the land was closed off .
it was isolated from the world , and knew neither hope nor despair .
an atmosphere of total stagnation ruled the land .
the rebels who dared to start an uprising ... were eliminated by the state .
the house takemikazuchi ... was a band of assassins , hired to quell this rebellion .
for a long time past ... they were the bodyguards of the rulers from a neighboring country .
but this land had overthrown its monarchy .
so they fled to this land , branded as exiles .
now they' re a band of mercenary assassins .
selling their skills to anyone in need of effective killing .
the takemikazuchi .
mother .
byakurai is looking for you .
anka ran away this morning .
if he has deserted the takemikazuchi ... he will betray our secrets .
he wants to flee to the shikon mountain .
but with that leg of his , he won' t even have reached the old mine yet .
yuki .
take kiri with you .
i go alone .
i' m going too .
he will only slow me down .
take me with you .
that' s what byakurai wants .
would you really kill anka ?
of course .
and when he begs for mercy ?
even then i' il kill him .
i don' t think so .
yuki , it' s you .
i' m unarmed .
don' t kill me .
please .
take my sword .
just tell them you' ve killed me .
alright ?
i see that i' m no longer a match for you , yuki .
who are you ?
my name is kuka .
i used to work for your mother .
i' m here to tell you something .
about the way your mother died .
you believe that she was killed in a raid .
but she was murdered by byakurai .
you' re lying .
byakurai is the murderer of your mother .
azora , princess takemikazuchi .
you must avenge her and take your mother' s rightful place .
or leave .
tomorrow is your 20th birthday .
on that day , a princess becomes the leader of the takemikazuchi .
you must take over the house' s leadership .
or you must leave .
should you decide to leave ... come to meet me at the old mine .
with this i have delivered the message from azora to you .
did anka beg for mercy ?
did my mother beg for mercy ?
what do you mean ?
your voice is quivering .
you think feverishly .
do you realize what you' re doing ?
tell me !
byakurai .
did you kill my mother ?
no .
yuki , put away your sword .
i' il overlook this incident .
i never meant to tell you this .
your mother was killed , because she wanted to betray us .
and wanted to flee .
liar .
stop it .
fighting will only make this worse .
you leave me no choice .
die .
important news from the assembly .
the ministry of consumption reports ... that the living standard has increased by 20 percent last year .
to celebrate this news ... the citizens took to the streets .
it turned into a spontaneous parade of rejoicing .
aya .
what' s wrong ?
you want to kill me with this ?
you' re of the takemikazuchi aren' t you ?
who sent you ?
tell me .
where are the others ?
there are no others .
and i don' t want to kill you .
you' re lying .
you expect me to believe that ?
trust me .
trust you ?
you' re prepared to kill anybody for money .
if i trust you , that will get me killed .
if it were you i was after ... you' d be dead right now .
do you trust me now ?
doesn' t that hurt ?
of course it does .
if you allow the pain .
i saw a girl .
where is she ?
i' m alone here .
that bed is mine .
goodnight .
we' ve lost her .
on the way through the forest .
is that all you have to report ?
no .
someone saw a car .
we' re keeping an eye on the road .
she' il be back .
she wants revenge .
somebody told her .
but who ?
that' s the question .
yuki turned 20 today .
whoever told her about azora must have known that and its meaning .
kuka .
she wants to kill you , to avenge azora ?
then she will be coming here .
there can be no doubt .
suppose kuka would want to speak with yuki .
where would he meet her ?
where he lives maybe .
i' d do it somewhere else entirely ...
how are you ?
it' s me , kidokoro .
i' ve returned .
there' s something i want to talk to you about .
i' m coming today .
no , i will come to you .
the day after tomorrow .
agreed .
i' il be waiting for you at the usual location .
a man once made a promise to azora , heiress to house takemikazuchi .
he swore fealty to the house .
but byakurai branded him a traitor and killed him .
that man was my father ?
you wouldn' t be able to remember that , you were only 2 years old .
the takemikazuchi still had many members back then .
byakurai wanted to marry azora himself .
and make house takemikazuchi his own .
but azora refused this .
in her desperation she wanted to disband the takemikazuchi .
but byakurai found out about it , and ended her life .
that changed everything .
many were dissatisfied with byakurai .
they tried to detach themselves from him .
but there were only few who managed to escape .
most of them had to pay for their attempt with their lives .
only one or two got away .
this is the place where princess azora died .
undoubtedly she hoped for you to leave the takemikazuchi .
she wanted you to succeed where she had failed .
there is no sense in seeking out byakurai for vengeance .
the takemikazuchi are doomed to disappear
princess yuki .
your mother was tortured to death in this place .
but the final blow was dealt by me .
you may kill me now if you wish .
since then i' ve been waiting only for this day to come .
i offered to join her on her journey to the other side .
but she didn' t allow me to .
she ordered me to tell you everything .
once you reached the age of 20 .
princess yuki is the one who must slay me now .
don' t say that .
that would be pointless .
so it was you , kuka .
soma .
my , how you have grown .
if you' il allow me ...
this is what i' ve wanted .
princess yuki , do not die .
kill me if you want .
but don' t raise your sword against princess yuki .
i can' t promise you that .
when i was little ...
i used to be cheerful all the time .
i never dreamed ... that it would end like this .
do you know why people thought like that back then ?
because nobody had ideals .
certainly , people died because of our bomb at the assembly .
but is was very effective .
you should be proud of that .
but it was a holiday .
the assembly would be empty .
that' s what you told me .
some losses are inevitable .
we don' t get it for nothing .
mimura knew that .
he did not die in vain .
nobody will pay us any heed if there aren' t any civilian deaths .
i want to move on to the next project now .
sugimoto ... thought differently .
did he call you while i was gone ?
last month .
sugimoto is no longer with us .
i have faith in you .
we must be prepared to do whatever it takes for our ideals .
takashi .
do you know what the safest place in the jungle is ?
on the back of the lion .
the fleas on its back live an extremely peaceful life .
what the ...
where are you bleeding ?
you need protein .
otherwise you won' t heal .
put this on .
it' s the only thing there is .
hurry up .
it suits you .
what are you doing ?
i' m throwing these away .
have you seen kidokoro ?
takashi , beware of him .
have you heard about sugimoto ?
kidokoro told me he is no longer a member .
he' s dead .
murdered .
i' m leaving this country .
there must be happiness somewhere .
i' m trying to find that .
who' s that ?
she' s a guest .
a guest ?
so you have found happiness .
good luck to you .
let me know , should you want to come with me .
thanks .
why did you come back ?
what happened this time ?
you don' t want to tell me .
it' s probably safer for me if i don' t know .
is it difficult for you to kill someone ?
why do you kill people ?
for the money ?
my body moves .
when i' m holding my sword , and approach the victim ... my body seems to move by itself .
without any conscious thought .
ah , poor you .
a monarch no longer wants to pay his bodyguards .
so they take their talents elsewhere .
you just kill people .
not to defend your country , not to defend yourself .
you have nothing to defend .
you just kill .
but i did ... have a reason .
i certainly had a reason ...
to kill people .
a reason to kill .
come .
my sister .
when she was 8 years old , i came home from school one day .
everything was covered in blood .
only she was still alive .
the perpetrators were acquitted , for lack of evidence .
so i killed them myself .
i was arrested .
i was put on trial and convicted .
when i came out 4 years later ...
i had a completely different view of the world than i did before .
everything seemed different .
and then i met someone .
he told me ... that he wanted to see me as happy as i had been before .
he was the only one who said that .
i did things .
i was forced to do things .
to become happy again ...
i rationalized everything .
renkyo .
i need to talk to you .
about what ?
can we really kill yuki ?
without yuki ... we will no longer have a leader of takemikazuchi blood .
and then ...
then what ?
there are only very few takemikazuchi left .
we' ve lost almost everyone .
but what reason is there for us to continue ?
without that name .
we don' t need a reason .
there' s nobody for us to guard anymore .
i honored our ancestors .
i believed in the fatherland .
but when the monarchy fell ...
our swords were taken from us .
some were imprisoned .
their memories erased with drugs .
to block their fighting power ... needles were stuck into their elbows .
some of us have fled .
but never have we fought against the motherland .
do you remember , renkyo ?
those tanks on the southern island ... that we encountered along the way ?
corroded by the acid rain .
the stench of corpses filled the air .
but there were no corpses .
the stench came from us .
at that moment ... we were dead .
hello .
it' s me .
kidokoro .
why do you call ?
i' ve sent you some plans .
could you have a look at them ?
sure .
i' il be right back .
did you see it ?
in ten days we' il make our move .
are you there ?
ten days .
i can' t make it .
alright .
when can you ?
never .
you won' t do it ?
no .
very well .
i' il contact you later .
you always look so somber .
you' re expressionless yourself .
have you ever been somber ?
i suppress it , like pain .
and that' s how you can kill people ?
when you' re somber ... you mourn .
when you' re happy , you act cheerful .
have you ever laughed ?
when i' m somber , i mourn .
for hours .
for days .
for years .
do you know what miki ishi means ?
no .
it means ' beautiful gemstone ' .
they' re very rare .
even if you search for a year ... you' il find one at most .
if you polish them , you will get a green crystal .
my mother used to collect them .
whenever she had one , she' d polish it and keep it safely .
when she had thirty ... she' d make them into a necklace for me .
for my wedding day .
she' d put it around my neck on the day i was to be married .
she started to collect when she was 18 .
she had me when she was 22 .
and she died when she was 27 .
on the day she died , she had nine of those crystals .
in a little box .
not enough for a necklace .
soon i' il be as old as she was when she had me .
and then as old as when she died .
but i' ve collected nothing to leave behind .
to nobody .
i don' t have anyone to leave something to .
i have nobody .
nobody to cherish .
let' s go away from here .
away from this country .
there' s nothing to keep us here .
there must be a place somewhere .
away from here .
a place where we can forget everything .
let' s go to that place .
your mother .
at this moment ...
i feel happy .
but will you ever be capable of feeling happiness ?
i don' t think so .
mother .
now ...
i' m happy .
you will never know happiness .
even if you' d kill me ... you will keep walking the path of death .
that is unavoidable .
kidokoro .
your sister looks very well .
what do you want from me ?
is it about the plans ?
no , i have a different plan .
it' s a very good plan .
you will like it .
what' s the plan ?
we' il strike a bargain with the government .
we will accomplish our ideals , and there won' t be many casualties .
what do you think , takashi ?
good plan , isn' t it ?
you' re betraying me ?
it' s all been arranged .
we keep quiet and our ideals will be safe .
traitor .
we' il continue in spirit .
the plan that i sent you , would have been the last .
because we' d all be dead afterwards ?
don' t talk to me like that .
it' s what you' ve always wanted .
you have it your way .
and so you keep out of harm' s way .
we' ve made the deal .
it' s a good deal .
then why did we do it ?
why all the casualties ?
it meant something .
we believed in our ideals .
no , we all believed in you .
manabe shot .
kazuki tortured .
mimura blown up .
they all believed in you .
you said we' d be happy again .
but that only goes for you .
happiness will come .
but not just like that .
you knew the price would be high .
we pray for the victims .
takashi .
you won' t have to pray .
because you' re one of the victims we' il be praying for .
you bastard .
i' m azora' s daughter .
princess yuki of the takemikazuchi .
in the name of my mother ...
i claim your life .
don' t you understand ?
it' s over .
scram .
i want to keep that .
live .
be happy .
live for me .
