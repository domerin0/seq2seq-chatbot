what ?
in life , there are all sorts of wake up calls .
but crowing on east 73rd street was one i was not prepared for .
it was my own fault .
i' d let my frenzy for a rent controlled apartment near barneys , override the fact that it was animal hospital adjacent .
that' s the thing about new york you never know what' s just around the corner .
or , in samantha' s case , just outside your window .
there they were samantha' s neighbourhood , transsexual hookers .
half man , half woman , totally annoying .
girl , she got herself a handful with that one !
he was all up in my stuff once .
i told him to get that thing out of my ass or i' il shit on it .
get that out my ass , or i' il shit on it .
is that the dirtiest thing you' ve ever heard ?
let' s hope so !
i am paying to live in a neighbourhood that' s trendy by day , and tranny by night .
transsexuals .
chicks with dicks .
boobs on top , balls down below .
i don' t get the appeal there .
it' s the other white meat .
i understand that pseudo straight men have to get laid , but not on my block .
i thought my chickens were bad .
every morning at 4 : 00 am they start up .
it' s like they' re putting on a show .
the " up my ass players " .
too early for tranny talk ?
it' s so weird to be sitting here eating omelette again
like nothing ever happened .
it was our first saturday morning breakfast since charlotte had left trey , her husband of three months .
i was married .
and now , what ?
i' m single again ?
you' re not single , you' re just separated .
that' s right .
i' il never be single again ...
i' il be divorced .
the only thing worse than being 34 and single is being 34 and divorced .
nice .
i think it' s worse to be 34 and trapped in a marriage that doesn' t work .
didn' t i try hard enough ?
" hard " is the word .
sweetie , trey has an impotence problem ...
i am so sick of talking about trey .
i think and talk about trey all the time .
change the subject , please .
talk about the " up my ass " stuff .
ok , here' s the plan .
sunday night , we all come over , have an unpacking party and no trey talk .
i' il bring the cocktails .
i' il bring the food .
how about roof chicken ?
can i help you ?
i live around the corner and my window
looks over the roof with the chickens and the crowing ...
roosters .
excuse me ?
they are roosters .
roosters crow .
yes , they do .
and very loudly .
i' m so sorry .
we just got them .
rescued from a cockfight in the bronx .
my god .
i' il have them moved to the basement .
you don' t have to do that .
they had all that fight trauma .
they need fresh air .
i don' t want them to be miserable .
don' t worry .
they have a very lovely life .
that' s all right .
i' il get over it .
thank you for being so nice .
just gonna take one of these for my friend .
she has a cat .
are you hungry ?
yeah ?
i' m hungry too .
shanghai garden .
may i help you ?
i' d like to order some take out .
address , please .
331 west 78th street .
apartment 4f .
i' d like to order some chicken with broccoli in a brown ...
brown sauce , with brown rice .
cold noodles .
i know .
every night the same .
right .
the chinese take out lady thinks i' m pathetic .
every night , the same thing .
that' s a tad bitchy for a take out lady .
do you think i' m in a rut ?
a food rut ?
i' m sitting home with my cat , ordering the same thing almost every night .
the only thing sadder would be to have a cathy comic on my refrigerator door .
never say cathy comic to me again .
she giggled at me .
the take out lady .
order from someplace else .
there is like 600 chinese places on your block .
this place is my favourite .
it' s easier than figuring out where else to go .
then bear the take out food shame .
there they were .
our ex boyfriends .
what are they doing together ?
are they friends now ?
apparently .
this is bad .
what do you think they are talking about ?
their dogs ?
how' s your dog ?
good , yours ?
was that the bitches who ruined our lives ?
they didn' t see us .
we have a choice .
we can either run the other way or move into this building .
we can' t run .
your shoe straps will break .
how do i look ?
good .
great !
you look great too .
thank god i didn' t wear my drawstring pants .
look who it is !
that' s another thing about new york .
you never know who is around the corner .
this is what i like about new york .
street traffic .
well , look at you .
look who it is , pete .
my god !
look how big he got .
he starts college next year .
you must be very proud .
two beers at a time .
did miranda and i give you guys a drinking problem ?
they are not just for us .
i' il have nightmares about that ladies room for weeks .
carrie and miranda , this is jessica and susan .
hello .
honey , do you still wanna see the movie or just crash ?
i don' t care .
we have to go .
yeah , we gotta go .
it was good to see you , aidan .
come on , this way .
that night at charlotte' s , some light unpacking and some heavy realisations .
well , they are over us .
it' s just so hilarious .
i' m haemorrhaging inside .
we thought they were sitting there , pining , and they have new girlfriends already !
were they cute ?
the point is not if they were cute .
the point is , they were there .
they were cute .
very cute .
how can they have new relationships ?
i' m still in the " i just broke up with someone " phase .
it' s infuriating .
women sit around obsessing about what went wrong .
men just say " all righty " and move on .
i take offence at that generalisation .
not all women sit around and obsess about men .
as soon as my relationships are over , i move on .
relationships ?
you know , dates .
i do try to figure out what went wrong .
but i don' t think that i obsess .
you are miss obsess .
big ?
big was tricky .
i still don' t know what happened there .
you should have a relationship rear view mirror .
relationships may appear closer than they actually are .
i didn' t obsess about aidan .
aidan was clear .
he moved on .
it' s much easier for men to move on .
is it ?
oh , please !
the ratio of women to men in this city is huge .
they can sit outside , have a beer and wait for the jessicas and susans to come to them .
maybe we only obsess over relationships that feel unfinished .
i can guarantee that trey isn' t sitting around with his friends , obsessing about what went wrong .
men never think anything is their fault .
i wish there were no men .
call someone , she' s gone insane .
if there were no men , then we wouldn' t feel hurt .
and we wouldn' t be disappointed .
and we wouldn' t be spending our entire night obsessing about them .
i' m so over men .
what ?
i am .
later that night i got to thinking about men and women and relationships .
or more to the point , how women feel men disappoint them in relationships .
then a radical , almost earth shattering thought popped into my head .
what if everything isn' t the man' s fault ?
after a certain age and a certain number of relationships , if it still isn' t working and the ex' s seem to be moving on and we don' t , perhaps the problem isn' t the last boyfriend , or the one before him or even the one before him .
could it be , that the problem isn' t them , but horror of horrors , is it us ?
downtown , the " up my ass players " were in the middle of their late night repertory .
much ado about up my ass " and " long day' s journey up my ass " .
samantha decided if she was gonna get a good night' s sleep , she' d have to test how effective a pr professional she was .
ladies , hello .
i live right up there , the loft within earshot .
as much as i respect a woman' s right for a little something with certain new jersey gentlemen ,
i have a request .
i have a very early business meeting .
and i think we all know , there are certain dark circles even the best make up tricks can' t cover .
am i right ?
sorry to wake you , baby .
we' il take it down here .
i appreciate it .
by the way , i' m samantha .
destiny .
chyna .
jo .
no " e " .
she got the " e " cut off .
those heels are fierce , miss girl .
don' t i know it .
samantha always knew how to get her way with men , even if they were half women .
what ?
rough night ?
who is this ?
it' s me .
i didn' t recognise your voice .
you sounded different .
did i wake you ?
it' s only 11 : 30 .
no , i was up late working .
and there were these goddamn chickens that crow on the roof next door .
roosters .
roosters crow .
the " fun on the farm " fact everyone seems to be aware of but me .
so tell me , is red a mistake ?
in what way ?
i' m repainting my bedroom .
a red bedroom ?
just one wall .
but i think it' s too red .
it' s like sleeping in communist china .
she left ...
we ended it .
i heard .
you did ?
how ?
i think it was on the news .
could we have lunch sometime ?
i really need to talk to you .
please ?
where ?
the boathouse restaurant , central park .
how about saturday at 2 : 00 ?
carrie ?
i' m nodding .
so i' il see you at 2 : 00 then .
bye .
later that day , i met miranda at my favourite thrift store , to dig for buried treasure .
do you think i can get away with a " hang in there , baby " halter top ?
nobody gets away with a " hang in there , baby " halter top .
do you wanna go to the hopper exhibit saturday afternoon ?
i can' t .
i have to work .
i lied .
i don' t have to work .
i' m meeting big for lunch and i didn' t think you' d approve .
you' re meeting big ?
he called .
he sounded upset and needed to talk .
since when does big talk ?
what does that mean ?
he' s upset about natasha leaving ...
i' m not holding your hand through this again .
i' m not asking you to hold my anything .
we' re just having lunch .
it' s a huge mistake .
it' s not a huge mistake , it' s lunch .
how many more times are you gonna go through this ?
he is bad for you .
every time you get near him you turn into this pathetic , needy victim .
what pisses me off is that you are more than willing to go back for more .
i am not going back for more and i can' t even believe ...
i can' t believe you would say that to me .
if you start up with big again ...
i am not starting up with big again .
if you do , i don' t wanna know anything about it .
no calls .
no crying .
are you gonna cut me out of your life like you did to steve ?
what ?
first sign of any little weakness or flaw and you just write people off .
my god , miranda .
you are so judgmental .
you can say that i' m pathetic and needy and i can' t say anything to you ?
everybody is not as tough as you , miranda .
people ...
some of us make mistakes .
that' s just perfect .
walk away .
it' s all my fault .
right there , next to the 2 for $5 bin ,
miranda and i had our first big fight .
you have no messages .
i thought by the time i got home , she would have left an apology on my machine .
i was gonna call her , but wasn' t quite sure of what to say .
or whose fault it really was .
and at the exact same moment across town ,
miranda was preparing to make the call she' d been dreading all day .
shanghai garden .
may i help you ?
i' d like to order some take out .
address , please .
331 west 78th street , apartment 4f .
i' d like some ...
chicken with broccoli , brown sauce , brown rice and cold noodles , right ?
you know what ?
i don' t need this .
never mind .
ok .
bye bye .
after she hung up , miranda couldn' t get the giggle out of her head .
she decided to walk the two blocks to confront the woman with the judgmental giggle who thought she was better than her .
shanghai garden .
may i help you ?
ok .
address , please .
224 west 78th ...
sorry , 73 .
miranda realised the giggle wasn' t about her at all .
it wasn' t about anything .
it wasn' t the noodles that kept her coming back to this particular restaurant .
it was the fact that this had been their place and it was filled with happy memories .
twice in one week .
am i lucky or what ?
i thought i got custody of this place .
i like their hot and sour soup .
are you here by yourself ?
me too .
sit down .
i' ve got this bowl of crunchies that i' il never get through .
how are you ?
not good .
carrie and i had a huge fight .
about what ?
me , her , you , big ...
me .
my judgmental stuff .
how bad was it ?
it wasn' t good .
steve , i didn' t throw you away .
did i ?
no .
she said i did .
miranda ...
only you and i can ever really know what happened between you and i.
it' s nobody else' s business .
but she said that , huh ?
must' ve been pretty mad .
i didn' t say nice things to her either .
i just don' t want her to get hurt again .
so you yelled at her ?
yeah .
sounds about par .
i guess your new girlfriend doesn' t yell .
no .
how' s that going ?
it' s ok .
like to order ?
yes , i' d like the chicken with broccoli ...
let me see the menu .
i should try something new .
you should .
go ahead .
live a little .
there is so much .
you' re so fucking hot .
i can' t believe they go away for one night and then back three in a row .
forget them .
look at me .
i' m sorry .
i' m here .
where are those cops ?
i called them half an hour ago .
look at me .
let' s bring it on home .
i can' t .
i' m close .
well , i' m not .
the idea that she' d miss a night' s sleep , pissed samantha off .
the idea that she' d miss an orgasm , was more than she could bear .
shut up , you bitches !
i' ve called the cops .
suck my cock !
keep talking and i' il come down there and cut it off for you .
i' d like to see you try , motherfucker .
you think we want that bs ?
no way !
are you gonna pull a lorena bobbit ? $7, 000 a month and i have to put up with this , talking to fucking trannies ?
i don' t fucking think so !
i am a taxpayer and a member of the young women' s business association .
i don' t have to put up with this shit !
forget them and come back to bed .
there was nothing anyone could do to stop her .
samantha was obsessed .
she had a date with destiny , chyna and jo , no " e " .
take this , ladies !
i' m gonna come up there and kick your ass , bitch !
get off my hair now !
move it along , girls .
you heard the man , move it along .
hey , where are you going ?
home .
you freak me out .
and uptown , charlotte was a bit freaked out as well .
unable to sleep and unable to unpack , she was spending time with the only man she could tolerate the dalai lama .
charlotte ?
it' s me .
trey ?
what are you doing here ?
it' s 4 : 00 am .
i saw your light on from the street .
i figured you' d still be up .
what do you want ?
ever since you left , i can' t stop thinking about you .
honey , we' re separated .
i know .
it seems , once charlotte swore off men , this man couldn' t get enough of her .
he wasn' t a rooster and it wasn' t the bronx , but from somewhere deep inside ,
trey' s cock began to crow .
across town , i was still wide awake .
i couldn' t get my fight with miranda out of my head .
turns out , i was not only capable of obsessing about relationships with men ,
i was capable of obsessing about relationships with women .
east side animal shelter .
please leave a message .
this is your neighbour who complained about the chickens .
i' m leaving a message ' cause i can' t take it any more .
move them in .
thanks .
i figured if they had a lovely life , i was entitled to the same thing .
well ...
all righty .
i knew that was in me somewhere .
you did ?
i just hadn' t felt it since before ...
why did you stop yourself ?
before what ?
since before we got engaged .
oh .
yeah .
oh .
do you think our whole problem had to do with the fact that ...
what ?
say it .
you didn' t really wanna marry me .
no .
i think it may be due to the fact that i didn' t want to get married to anybody .
then why did you ?
i guess i thought it was time .
i' m of a certain age , people expect you to get married .
yes , well ...
that sounds familiar .
one other thing ...
what ?
i married you because i knew i' d never find anyone as wonderful as you to marry .
he may have gone away , the transsexual , but he came back , loaded with eggs .
now who' s laughing , bitch ?
samantha knew this was one relationship with a man she couldn' t walk away from .
because this man was half woman .
good , you' re there .
i was just gonna call you .
do you really think i' m pathetic ?
no , i' m so sorry .
i don' t think you' re pathetic at all .
i' m outside the restaurant , hiding in some bushes .
do you still not think i' m pathetic ?
i know you think it' s a huge mistake .
it' s just something i feel i need to do to move on .
don' t listen to me .
i have no idea what' s right for you and big .
but if i' m wrong and it is a huge mistake , i need to know you' il be there for me .
i' m there .
i' m going in .
any last minute advice ?
don' t let him kiss you .
that seems to be where you get into trouble .
carrie ?
i' m nodding .
hello , you .
hello , you .
it' s good to see you .
are you ok ?
my hair is in a duck pond .
my dior purse .
i' il get it .
oh , my god !
what is that ?
how was your shower ?
i no longer smell of pond .
exactly how many terry cloth robes do you have ?
three or four .
oh , three or four .
i swore i would never be in this room with you again .
you said to take you to the nearest shower .
that is one red wall .
yes , it' s red .
i gotta ask you a question .
was it all my fault ?
no .
it wasn' t all your fault .
we really screwed that up .
what were we thinking ?
i have no idea .
fuck .
i was counting on you for answers .
how are you doing , kid ?
pretty good .
how are you doing ?
good .
beside for the fact i feel like i' ve been through a war .
we really were war buddies .
war buddies in calvin klein robes .
i hate to admit this , but i kind of like living alone again .
why doesn' t that surprise me ?
i should go .
don' t you want to stay a while ?
i can' t .
why ?
because , sweet friend , you and i are like that red wall .
it' s a good idea in theory .
but somehow , it doesn' t quite work .
and just like that , i realised big and i weren' t " us " any more .
we had become something else .
what it was , i had no idea .
you have one new message .
it' s me .
i' m just wondering how it went .
call me when you get home .
i had no idea where the chickens had gone , but i hoped it wasn' t the bronx .
and i hoped they were happy .
who wants a wiener ?
girl , i' m trying to get rid of one .
the next saturday , samantha decided to throw a kiss and make up party for the " up my ass players " .
trey called me three times last week .
he' s dying to get back together .
but i don' t know .
is that wise ?
i' m obsessing again , aren' t i ?
a bit .
so , what are we all drinking ?
flirtinis . " vodka , pineapple and champagne .
flirtinis .
destiny made them .
i' m way past a flirtini .
i need a " fucktini " .
watch your language .
there are ladies present .
where ?
you with the flower .
are you talking to me ?
it' s you , girl .
come on .
what do you want ?
i want you to give me a swirl .
i need to see you spin first , sister .
is that good enough ?
give me the shake .
don' t mind the weight .
eat something .
don' t worry , they have a very lovely life .
