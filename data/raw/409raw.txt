give me room .
here we go .
what' s this game called ?
lightcycle .
damn !
you' re getting brutal and needlessly sadistic , sark .
thank you , master control .
we' ve kidnapped military programs .
i can arrange more lethal matches .
interested ?
sure .
i' d love to go up against one of those guys .
it' d make a nice break from those accounting cream puffs .
what branch of the service ?
strategic air command .
nice !
look .
this is all a mistake .
i' m just a compound interest program .
i work at a savings and loan .
i can' t play these video games !
sure you can .
you look like a natural athlete .
me ?
i get out of breath checking on t bill rates .
you' re gonna make my user , mr. henderson , very angry .
he' s a full branch manager .
another religious nut !
i' d say " welcome , friend " , but not here .
i don' t know what i' m doing here .
do you believe in the users ?
sure .
if i don' t have a user , who wrote me ?
that' s what you' re doing here .
master control program' s been snapping up all us programs who believe .
if you' re useful , he takes over all your functions .
if he can' t use you , he sends you here to get your bits blasted .
what' s your name ?
crom .
i' m ram .
they' il train you for the games , but ...
i hope you make it .
what' s been going on in the other sectors ?
i' ve been stuck here for 200 microcycles .
it' s murder out there .
you can' t travel in your own microcircuits ... without permission from master control program .
sending me to play games .
who does he calculate he is ?
okay , clu , tonight we check everything in the right hand column .
where are you ?
there you are .
clu ?
yes , sir .
this is top priority .
i know , sir .
it isn' t just correcting my bank statement or phone bill .
this is a must !
i understand .
i wrote you and taught you everything about the system .
thank you , but ...
no buts .
that' s for users .
you' re the best program ever written .
you' re dogged and relentless .
let me at ' em .
that' s the spirit .
keep that tank rolling .
i' il cover you from this end .
you think we can merge with this memory , bit ?
yes .
hmm .
flynn is saying to look over here .
i don' t see what we' re looking for .
come on , you scuzzy data , be in there .
uh oh !
we' ve got company .
i don' t believe this .
a recognizer .
there' s too many !
what is this ?
ahhh !
dammit !
get out of here !
yes yes yes .
busted again !
that was my best program .
got a pirate program here .
says his name' s clu .
what did he pull ?
he came into the system with a stolen password .
we caught him trying to raid our high clearance memory .
no !
i must' ve gotten in by mistake .
who programmed you ?
i was simp
ahhh !
you' re in trouble , program .
make it easy on yourself .
who' s your user ?
forget it ,
mister high and mighty master control .
you aren' t making me talk .
suit yourself .
ahhh !
get me dillinger .
good evening , mr. dillinger .
thank you , peter .
you can go now .
yes , sir .
no problem , master c.
if you' ve seen ... one electronics show , you' ve seen them all .
what' s up ?
flynn ?
yes .
he' s looking for that old file .
can' t you appropriate it ?
i put it in my memory which he hasn' t located .
he might find it .
i' m afraid so .
i spotted him this time and kept him out .
it' s getting trickier .
we should shut down all access ... until we find that flynn .
there' s a 68 . 71 % chance you' re right .
cute .
come on !
alan , think i can have some of your popcorn ?
yeah , sure .
sit down .
thank you .
we' ve had to shut down ... all group 7 personnel ... just briefly .
security .
someone has been tampering .
you don' t think it' s me !
i don' t even balance my checkbook on downtime .
it' il only be a couple of days .
what' s your project ?
it' s called tron .
it' s a security program .
it monitors contacts between our system and others .
anything not scheduled , it shuts it down .
i sent you a memo .
part of the master control program ?
no .
it' il run independently and watchdog the mcp as well .
sounds good .
we should have you running in a couple of days .
i hope .
okay .
thanks .
oh , boy .
mr. dillinger , i' m very disappointed in you .
i' m sorry .
i can' t afford an independent programmer monitoring me .
you realize how many systems i' ve gone into ?
how many programs i' ve appropriated ?
come on !
a couple of days !
hi , dr gibbs .
here goes nothing .
you hear what you just said ?
here goes nothing " .
actually , we propose to change something ... into nothing and back again .
you might have said , " here goes something , here comes nothing " .
right .
this is the big moment .
this' il narrow your theory that the scan u v beam ... is superior to single pulse exposure .
laser activity will exist in 30 seconds .
put on your goggles .
leave the bay .
let' s see if we' ve got the green light .
target area shielded ?
they verified safety .
20 seconds .
looks good .
let her rip .
this is what we' ve been waiting for .
10 seconds .
5 seconds .
perfect !
beautiful !
hi , alan .
having fun disintegrating things ?
not disintegrating , digitizing .
a laser dismantles the molecular structure .
molecules remain suspended in the laser beam .
when the computer plays out the model , the molecules fall back into place , and voil !
great .
can it send me to hawaii ?
you' ve got to purchase your program 30 days in advance .
how' s it going upstairs ?
frustrating .
i had tron almost ready ... when dillinger cut everyone with group 7 access out .
ever since he got ... that master control program , the system' s got more bugs than a bait store .
you gotta expect some static .
computers are machines .
they can' t think .
some programs will be thinking soon .
computers will start thinking , and the people will stop .
i' m gonna put some data through .
see you .
bye .
come on .
did you say group 7 access ?
yeah .
what a hassle .
i was all set .
did he say why ?
something about tampering .
flynn has been thinking ... about breaking into the system ... ever since dillinger canned him .
and he had group 7 access .
flynn had access to you , too .
i want to go to flynn' s place .
what for ?
to warn him .
of what ?
that dillinger' s onto him .
i don' t see why i have to do that guy any favors !
i don' t know what you saw in that guy .
i loved him for his brain .
don' t put change in the meter .
we' re gonna need it for the games .
boy !
i haven' t been here in a long time .
hey , bobby , up here .
where is he ?
i don' t know .
where is he ?
i don' t know .
somewhere in here lost in one of his games .
do you know where flynn is ?
on his machine .
he' s really on a roll !
one more reco before he ties .
another reco and he gets the world' s record .
he' s going for the record .
the all time record coming up .
this is it .
it' s all over .
flynn' s gonna make him a part of history !
flynn , how' d you do it ?
it' s all in the wrists .
999, 000 points !
hey , good to see you guys .
nothing classes up the joint like a clean cut couple .
we gotta talk .
you can' t hear yourself think in here .
come on .
come on .
i' il be down in a minute .
how' s the world of serious science ?
go make yourselves at home .
the best programmer encom ever saw , and he winds up playing space cowboy ... in some back room .
let me handle this .
go right ahead .
have you been sneaking ... into the encom system ?
you never were much for small talk .
does she still leave her clothes all over ?
no !
alan !
i mean , not that often .
you can see why all his friends ...
are 14 years old .
touch .
i have been doing a little hacking .
you did break in .
tried to .
i can' t seem to quite get the connection .
if i had a direct terminal ...
flynn , are you embezzling ?
embezzling is such an ugly word , mr. bradley .
actually , i' m trying to get some evidence together .
i don' t get it .
okay .
i don' t get it .
okay .
sherman , set the way back machine for 3 years ago .
kevin flynn , one of encom' s ... brightest young software engineers .
he' s so bright that he goes in at night , and begins writing a program for video games ... called " space paranoids " .
you invented " space paranoids " ?
paranoids " , " matrix blaster " , a whole slew of ' em .
i was this close to starting my own enterprise .
but enter another ; not so young or so bright , but very sneaky ;
ed dillinger .
one night , our boy flynn ... goes to his terminal , tries to read up his file .
i get nothing .
there' s a big blank .
3 months later ...
dillinger presents encom with 5 video games ... that he' s invented .
the slime didn' t even change the names !
he gets a big promotion .
thus begins his meteoric rise ... to ...
what is he ?
senior exec .
senior exec ?
meanwhile , the kids ... are putting 8 million quarters a week into paranoid machines .
i don' t see a dime , except what i squeeze outta here .
i still don' t understand why you want to break in .
somewhere in one of these memories is the evidence .
if i got in far enough i could reconstruct it .
my password , dillinger' s instructions to divert ...
too late !
dillinger' s cut off group 7 access .
wait .
what are you saying ?
the guy knows what you' re up to .
great .
you' re kidding me ?
now there is nothing to stop him .
it' s just dillinger and the mcp running things .
not if my tron program was running .
that' d shut the system down .
if your file was in there ...
if we can get in there , i can forge a group 6 access .
well ?
shall we dance ?
i shut down group 7 for a very good reason .
if our people can' t get access to their programs ...
you know how frustrating it is when you' re researching .
i sympathize , but i have data coming from mcp ... telling me there' s something screwy going on .
that mcp is half our problem !
the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do !
i can' t worry about every user request .
user requests are what computers are for .
doing our business is what computers are for !
encom isn' t the business you started in your garage .
we' ve accounts in 30 countries , new defense systems , one of the most sophisticated pieces of equipment .
i know all that .
sometimes i wish i were back in that garage .
that can be arranged , walter .
that was uncalled for .
you can remove alan and me , but we helped create it .
our spirit remains in every program we designed .
walter , it' s getting late .
i' ve got better things to do .
don' t worry about encom anymore .
it' s out of your hands now .
i don' t think i' m cleared for this .
i' m certainly not .
want to move aside ?
give the kid a little room .
this guy' s a little like santa claus .
i make these myself .
you want one ?
they never should have gotten rid of me .
now that is a big door .
shut up .
i programmed you to want too much .
i was planning to hit the pentagon .
the pentagon ?
it shouldn' t be harder than any big company .
this is what i get for using humans .
i wrote you !
what do you want with the pentagon ?
the same thing i want with the kremlin .
with the information i can access ,
i can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human .
if you think you' re superior to us ...
you wouldn' t want me to dig up flynn' s file ...
and read it up on a vdt at the times .
you wouldn' t dare !
hi .
hi .
working late ?
yeah .
okay .
come here .
i' m gonna put him at my terminal ... and meet you in your office upstairs .
don' t fall asleep .
if and when i activate tron , you' il only have a few minutes ... before dillinger catches the break .
as long as we stay off the top floor ,
dillinger will never know we' ve been in here .
good luck , hot shot .
ahem .
flynn !
after you .
keep those programers out of the system .
get me that chinese language file .
you are going to stick with me ?
what for ?
you' re the one who never needed help , remember ?
i' m scared of the dark .
all this technology scares me .
this way !
when did they put this in ?
this is where i work .
i' ve got a direct terminal in the laser target area .
you can stay there all night .
like a man says ,
there' s no problems , only solutions " .
remember , this lazer is my life' s work .
don' t spill anything .
huh ?
have fun , sweetheart .
hey , it' s the big master control program .
sit right there .
make yourself comfortable .
remember the time we spent playing chess together ?
stop !
please .
you realize i can' t allow this ?
how are you gonna run the universe ... if you can' t answer unsolvable problems ?
let' s see what you' ve got .
i' d like to see what you' re made of .
you don' t look a thing like your pictures .
you' re entering a big error .
i' m going to put you on the game grid .
you want games ?
this isn' t happening .
it only thinks it' s happening .
vacate entry port , program .
i said , move !
ah !
hey !
look , if this is about those parking tickets ,
i can explain everything .
prepare all programs for war games .
i' ve got a challenge for you , sark ; a new recruit .
it' s a tough case , but treat it in the usual manner .
train him for the games ,
let him hope , then blow him away .
you' ve got it .
i' ve been hoping you' d send me somebody with a little guts .
what kind of program is he ?
he' s not any kind of program .
he' s a user .
a user ?
that' s right .
he pushed me in the real world .
somebody pushes me , i push back .
so i brought him here .
what' s the matter ?
you look nervous .
well , i was just ...
i don' t know .
a user , i mean ...
users wrote us .
a user even wrote you !
no one user wrote me .
i' m worth millions of their man years .
what if ... ?
you' d rather take your chances with me ?
want me to slow down your power cycles ?
i need that !
then pull yourself together .
get this clown trained .
i want him in the games until he dies playing .
acknowledge .
acknowledged , master control .
end of line .
game unit 18 .
in here , program .
who you calling " program " , program ?
ah !
new guy ?
another free program off line .
you think the users are still there ?
they' d better be .
i don' t want to bust out of here ... and find nothing but cold circuits .
hey .
who are you guys ?
hold it !
watch those force fields .
you' il be having plenty of chances to get hurt .
just so i can tell my friends ... what this dream is about , where am l ?
you' re a ...
guest of the master control program .
oh , great .
he makes you play video games .
no sweat .
i play video games better than anybody .
move out !
this way .
you , you come this way .
i' ve gotta see the guy in charge .
you will .
look operative .
command program sark' s carrier is approaching .
he will explain the training procedures .
greetings .
the master control program has chosen you ... to serve your system on the game grid .
those of you who continue ... to profess a belief in the users ... will receive the standard substandard training , which will result in your eventual elimination .
those of you ... who renounce ... this superstitious and hysterical belief , will be eligible to join the warrior elite ... of the mcp .
you will each receive an identity disk .
everything you do or learn ... will be imprinted on this disk .
if you lose your disk or fail to follow commands , you will be subject to immediate de resolution .
that will be all .
move out .
who' s that guy ?
tron .
he fights for the users .
that' s pretty good .
you gotta be good if you want to survive .
what' s your name ?
my name' s ram .
hey , ram , what were you before ?
i was an actuarial program .
i worked for a big insurance company .
really gives you a great feeling ... helping folks plan for their future needs .
if you think of the payments as an annuity , the cost is quite minimal .
yeah , that' s great .
actuarial program .
nice .
how about yourself ?
i don' t remember too much .
name' s flynn .
disorientation is normal in transport .
it' il come back .
this is it .
good luck , flynn .
sir , conscript being moved ... from pit cell to ring game .
hey !
you guys sure are friendly .
wait .
let him fight one of his own kind .
you think you' re gonna wipe me out ?
no ...
hey !
that new guy was asking about you .
too bad he' s in a match .
i' il probably never meet him .
you might .
there' s something different about him .
okay .
that was a very fancy shot .
okay , here' s an easy one .
finish the game !
no !
kill him .
no .
you' il regret this .
ahh !
i want him in the games until he dies playing .
this is the holding area for the lightcycles .
you made it !
wait here .
alan .
where did you hear that name ?
that' s your name .
the name of my user .
how did you know ?
i' m a program from a user that knows alan .
he' s disoriented , tron .
i' m remembering all kinds of stuff ,
like my user wants me to go after the mcp .
my user wants that , too .
i know .
prepare to transport to lightcycle grid .
we have transport .
wow .
this is blue leader to blue bikes .
run these guys into your jet walls .
copy , blue leader .
this is gold 1 to gold 2 and 3 .
split up .
take them one on one .
watch it !
ahh !
taking him into the maze .
this is it .
come on .
gold 3 to gold 2 and 1 .
i' m getting out of here and you guys are invited .
got it .
ready ?
ready .
so long , sucker !
ahh !
greetings , programs !
warriors escaping game grid .
this is an illegal exit .
you must return to game grid .
this is an illegal exit .
gold 2 to gold 3 .
those demons are coming down .
get them !
send out every game tank in the grid .
get them !
i should never have written all those tank programs .
targets leaving protective field .
missed !
all units exiting game arena .
target units accelerating !
pursuit force minus one tank .
close ranks .
oh , man .
on the other side of the screen , it all looked so easy .
they must' ve gone right past us .
we made it ... this far .
pursuit force reporting .
we lost visual contact .
get the pursuit forces back into the canyons .
those programs never made it out .
we' il have them back before the interrupt interface .
we' d better , null unit .
i' il be lucky if the mcp doesn' t blast me .
i want those conscripts !
what is it ?
what do you see ?
watch it .
come on , you little bugger .
look at that .
when do we pay our visit ... to the old master control ?
what ?
there' s just 3 of us .
if you know anybody who' s got an army for rent , fine , but my user told me to take that sucker out , or i' m never getting out .
we can' t get to the mcp ... without the help of my user .
i have to get to that input/ output tower , and communicate with him .
check in with alan .
maybe he knows ...
what' s that ?
that ... is just ... what i need right now .
oh , it' s nice .
incredible .
boy , you forget how good the power feels ... until you get to a pure source .
my friends , my fellow conscripts , we have scored !
i feel so much better .
pursuit force reporting .
no sign of escaped units .
moving into next sector .
thank you .
i can feel it .
feel what ?
you okay ?
alan 1 .
let' s move out !
come on , flynn , put a cork in it .
one second !
ahhh !
range ... 9 ,
mark ... 45 , 48 degrees .
hold it .
hold it .
fire !
ram , flynn , do you read me ?
pursuit force reporting .
2 escaped units de rezzed .
no !
tron unit heading into next sector .
ram ?
come on !
we gotta get outta here .
no sign of life .
looks like we got ' em .
continue pursuit of remaining conscript .
acknowledged .
proceeding towards sector frontier .
we' re gonna make it , ram .
we gotta find you a place to rest .
hang in there , ram .
this looks like a good spot .
those tanks won' t find us here .
okay .
i thought this was supposed to be easy .
what' s going on ?
you see this ?
you shouldn' t be able to do that .
now for some ... real user power .
hey , this looks promising .
this is just like the old arcade grips .
let' s get this show on the road .
now we' re smokin ' !
how can you steal a recognizer ?
you don' t look good .
we' il get you fixed up .
come here .
oh , my user !
users are users .
they ...
are you a user ?
flynn , help tron .
ram !
ram ?
damn recognizer .
the thing just goes straight .
i gotta get to that l/ o tower .
program alu , request additional information .
prepare hanger for game simulation transport .
attention all units , lock onto matrix code .
prepare for digital beam transport .
activate hanger doors .
what' s the progress on the simulation ?
30 , 56 , 99 are correct .
limited 4 and 8 are missing .
don' t scream .
yori !
30 , 56 , 99 are correct .
limited 4 and 8 are missing .
no , i ...
tron !
ah !
yori .
i knew you' d escape .
they haven' t built a circuit that could hold you .
listen !
we have to make plans .
where can we go ?
this way , quickly .
hey !
hold it !
yes ?
what do you mean , " yes " ?
yes ?
that all you can say ?
no .
anything else ?
yes .
positive and negative , huh ?
you' re a bit .
yes .
where' s your program ?
lsn' t he gonna miss you ?
no .
i' m your program ?
yes .
another mouth to feed .
yes yes yes yes !
watch out for nested macros .
who are these weirdos ?
inoperative data pushers .
control programs !
come on .
pretty good drivin ' , huh ?
oh !
no !
who asked you ?
no no no no !
ahh !
this baby doesn' t handle so good in town .
what' s this do ?
how ' bout this one ?
no , no .
here comes a headache .
ahhh !
no no no no !
we gotta stop this thing !
yes !
i' m glad you agree !
uh , i' m fine .
no problem .
oh , this town is full of live ones .
this is where tron said he was going .
losing flynn .
i don' t believe this .
halt !
more guards .
they don' t see us .
i' il go first .
are you all right ?
yeah .
let' s do that some more .
i think the guard saw me .
come on !
halt .
dumont .
i can' t stand this commotion .
what do you want ?
i' ve come to communicate with my user .
difficult ... proposition at best .
i could be de rezzed for letting you in here .
they hate this tower .
they' d close it down if they dared .
they keep me around in case ... one of them wants to deal with the other world .
dumont !
my user has information that could ... make this a free system again .
really !
you' d have programs lined up to use this place , and no mcp looking over your shoulder .
when you' ve been in the system as long as i have , you hear many promises , reassurances ,
many brave plans .
please ?
the guards are coming .
there they are with the guardian .
all right , yori .
who is your user , program ?
alan 1 .
he calls me .
may i pass ?
all that is visible ... must grow beyond itself , and extend into the realm of the invisible .
you may pass , my friend .
the tower guardian is helping him .
he thinks .
bring in the logic probe .
more power !
it' s begun .
tron , location query .
confirm .
confirmed , alan 1 .
i am creating the information that will erase the mcp .
dedicate yourself to getting the disc into the heart ... of the mcp .
this interface is located at its base .
we will not be able to communicate again ... unless you succeed .
go !
this is the key to a new order .
this code disc means freedom .
i think they' re breaking in .
thank you , dumont .
hurry !
the users are waiting .
dumont ?
where' s the program ?
what program ?
take him !
stay close .
if i can get us on the scanning transport beam , this simulation will take us ... across the game sea ... back into the central computer .
look out !
ahhh !
ahhh !
commander , you' ve enjoyed the power you' ve been given .
i wonder how you' d take to working in a pocket calculator .
we did take care of that user you sent us .
incompetent zero .
now you' ve got 2 renegade programs ... flying all over the system in a stolen simulation .
i' il get them .
it' s only a matter of time .
you' ve almost reached your decision gate .
i can' t spare you any more time .
end of line .
it' s me , flynn !
flynn !
greetings , program .
you' re alive !
barely .
yeah , i uh ...
where' s ram ?
he didn' t make it .
come on .
lora .
this is flynn .
the one who busted me out .
lora ?
well , then i owe him some thanks .
it' s no big deal .
i ought to know lightcycle .
i wrote the program .
you wrote the program ?
it' s time i level with you .
i' m what you call a user .
you' re a user ?
i took a wrong turn somewhere .
if you are a user , everything you' ve done is according to a plan .
you wish .
you know what it' s like .
you keep doing what it looks like you' re supposed to , no matter how crazy .
that' s the way it is for programs , yes .
most of the time , that' s the way it is for users , too .
stranger and stranger .
so , nice looking ship you got here .
what do you want done with the tower guardian , dumont ?
put him with the others ?
no , bit brain , prepare him for inquisition .
i need a bit of relaxation .
first , rezz up the carrier for pursuit .
one other thing .
don' t think anymore .
i do the thinking around here .
this isn' t going to be easy .
if those grid bugs get us , we' ve had it .
had enough ?
what do you want ?
i' m busy .
busy dying , you worn out excuse for an old program .
yes , i' m old .
old enough to remember the mcp when it was a chess program .
he started small and he' il end small .
very funny .
maybe i should keep you around for a laugh .
what' s happening ?
power surge in the mcp .
get off this beam .
there isn' t a junction for 7 or 8 nano seconds .
there' s another beam !
it' s too far .
he' s creating a junction .
did we make it ?
yeah .
hurray for our side .
ls he de rezzing ?
no , but i couldn' t tell you why not .
i' m all in one piece .
i' m still with you .
ohhh !
tell the guy with the jackhammer to lay off .
how' d you do that ?
elementary physics : a beam of energy can always be diverted .
are we there yet , mommy ?
sark !
dumont !
yori .
tron ?
tron' s dead .
who' s that ?
that is a user .
he came here to help us .
tron believed in him .
if the users can no longer help us , we' re lost .
so , we have erased that program ...
no .
you were de rezzed .
not me , sark .
you' re nothing special , just an ordinary program .
so are you , one that should have been erased .
you' re nothing .
take that program to the holding pit .
please !
i' m taking our friend ... and some other religious fanatics to master control .
when i disembark , this ship and everything on board ... will automatically de rezz .
this means you .
move on !
lmmediate vectors detached .
route us to the mcp .
i want to get rid of this dead weight , and catch a transport beam to the game domain .
these walls ...
yori , something' s happening .
hey .
i still have power .
sark doesn' t know that .
leave me alone .
we' ve failed .
only if we give up !
come on , look , the wall !
yori .
you brought me back .
how ?
why did you bring me back ?
i need your help .
come on !
do something with these controls !
i' m on it .
the mcp , the heart of the whole system .
i feel a presence .
another warrior is on the mesa .
sark !
we' re getting closer .
i don' t know how you survived .
it doesn' t matter .
prepare to terminate .
all programs have a desire to be useful .
in moments , you will no longer seek communication ... with each other or your superfluous users .
you' il each be part of me .
together we will be complete .
you should have joined me .
we' d have made a great team .
you' re very persistent .
i' m also better than you .
sark ?
all my functions are now yours .
take them .
sark ?
sark ?
look !
your user can' t help you now , my little program .
i got it .
steer us by the beam .
right next to it .
what good will that do ?
i' m going to jump .
it' s the only way to help tron .
don' t .
you' il be de rezzed .
don' t worry .
come on , let' s go !
we did it !
that' s nice .
we thought you were dead .
where' s flynn ?
he threw himself into the beam and distracted the mcp ... just long enough for you to get your disc in .
he saved us .
he really did it .
look at the i/ o towers .
every tower is lighting up .
priority one !
try to look official .
here comes the boss .
pick me up in an hour .
greetings , programs .
