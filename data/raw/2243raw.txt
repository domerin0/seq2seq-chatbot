she' s found us .
and i thought it was just to hurt aidan , but it' s more than that .
she wants to be him .
and she wants to live for real this time .
you tell me , who can help me ?
who ?
i' m sure there' s a rational ...
you take his picture and tell me why she' s in it .
rachel .
you take his picture .
it' s proof that he' s what ?
he' s got a ghost inside him ?
no .
the proof is what will happen .
aidan , you said samara couldn' t hear us when we sleep .
well , you' re sleeping now .
tell me how to stop her , honey .
tell me how to help you .
just tell me , i' il do anything , i swear .
ms. keller ?
hello , i' m dr. emma temple .
i' m a consulting physician at county child services .
well , i was hoping to speak with aidan when he wakes up .
is everything all right in here ?
yeah .
it' s fine .
thank you .
i was hoping to speak with you as well .
it' s rachel , isn' t it ?
yeah , about his situation .
i' m sorry , what kind of doctor did you say you were again ?
i' m a psychiatrist .
yeah .
i spoke with a dr ... ... koji in seattle .
aidars doctor .
look , if we could maybe talk later .
right .
dr. koji mentioned that you dealt with some ppd when aidan was born .
postpartum depression .
that was the first month .
that' s all .
i understand .
it' s very common .
i mean , a lot of women have trouble adapting to the stresses of motherhood .
what does this have to do with what' s going on with my son right now ?
have you been under stress lately ?
have you ever found that you were ... ... unable to experience love for aidan ?
what ?
have you hurt him , however unintentionally ?
have you left him alone ?
abandoned him ?
i' d like to be with my son , please , if you don' t mind .
yeah , of course .
i' m sorry , rachel .
until we can talk further , i cannot let you be alone with him .
i' m his mother .
there are bruises on his body .
he was hypothermic and very near death .
that is not because of me .
he' s gonna be all right , rachel .
he will .
but you need to leave .
now , please .
you can' t have him , samara .
you' re going back to where you came from .
we' il talk in here .
it really will help .
sharing one' s troubles never hurt anybody .
now , are you a coffee drinker ?
black .
yeah , i imagined so .
dr. forrest , dial 118 , please .
dr. forrest , please dial 118 .
let' s call the doctor in seattle .
i want to know just how bad her postpartum got .
yes .
thank you .
the mother is missing .
i want a watch on this room .
she returns , she is not allowed in .
okay , dr. temple .
all i wanna know is her history before the morgans .
i' m sorry , but the privacy laws still apply .
well , was she really adopted ?
can you at least tell me that much ?
was their story true ?
samara morgan was adopted , yes .
but you won' t tell me from who ?
i' d lose my job if i did .
look , ma' am , my son has a medical condition that his doctors don' t even understand .
this little girl had the same condition .
now , if i knew what caused that , it could save his life .
all i can say is you should speak to the morgans .
they' re dead .
they both killed themselves .
whoa !
look out .
early birds .
marty savide , stevens northwest realty .

okay , then , don' t mind me .
my first try with these things , took off flying .

a little color will really turn the place around .
it' s got a wonderful history .
working horse ranch .
how about that ?
and there' s even this cute little tree house thing way up in the barn .
is the place being sold unfurnished or ... ?
the previous owners didn' t leave anything behind ?
well , there were some things that were left , after they ... ... moved .
we' re storing that in the basement .
there' s a basement ?
well , you betcha .
no extra charge .
right this way .
if you don' t mind , i' m the welcome wagon .
gotta open up the gate for everyone else .
so please , make yourself at home .
do you know what happened to them ?
the previous owners ?
i believe they bought a condo in phoenix .

her mother .
oh , my .
you' re awake .
i' il take it from here .
hello , aidan , i' m dr. temple .
how are you feeling ?
you know , i' d really like to help you .
can you tell me how you' re feeling ?
where' s my mommy ?
well , she' il be here soon .
she' s on her way .
i want mommy .
yeah , i know you do .
your mommy wants to be with you too .
so where is she ?
she went home .
she didn' t think that you were gonna wake up so soon .
i wanna go home too .
well , you will .
we just have to ...
we just have to get you ...
you' re freezing .
i wanna go home to mommy .
well , we need to talk about her .
can you tell me about mommy a little bit ?
she loves me .
i know that she does .
she went looking for me .
she tried to find me .
it means she loves me .
i don' t understand .
can i go home now ?
no , honey , you' re not well enough .
can i go home ?
no .
i' m sorry .
then i have to show you something .
it won' t stop .
i' m gonna walk you just around the corner here .
hi , i' m sister diane .
how can we help you ?
i need to know about a child who was born here .
is there anyone that can talk to me who' s been here more than 30 years ?
please , come in .
thank you .
i remember this , yes .
a young girl made it .
sixteen .
she was shy , quiet ... ... beautiful .
she stayed here ?
yes .
did she have her baby here ?
yes .
and you arranged for the adoption ?
that' s right .
who was she ?
she was picked up wandering the streets and brought to us .
she was from some little town up in the mountains .
she said she' d been sent away to live with relatives in the city .
but no relatives were ever found .
her name was evelyn .
she came to us eight months pregnant .
and the father ?
there was none .
half the mothers that come to us say that .
so , what did she think got her pregnant ?
she wasrt well .
hallucinations , visions .
she believed some thing had come for her baby from the waters of the world beyond this one .
i' m sorry .
did you say water ?
well , we all envision the afterlife differently .
for evelyn , it' s just what she believed .
as you might imagine , she suffered severe postpartum depression .
she blamed her troubles on her child .
so she tried to kill it .
all babies are a challenge .
but samara , she never cried .
never .
except when her mother would try to bathe her .
then she' d scream like it was the end of the world .
it was the screaming that woke us .
evelyn , don' t !
evelyn !
evelyn , stop !
she was trying to drown the baby .
the baby was taken from her , of course .
evelyn was institutionalized .
and all those pictures she' d been collecting , they finally made sense .
did she say why she did it ?
she felt she had to kill her baby to save it .
i' m here to see a patient .
her name' s evelyn .
i don' t know her last name .
evelyn ?
that' s right .
evelyrs expecting you .
every few years , one of you comes to see evelyn .
she' s like a freakir patron saint or something .
got a problem with your kid , don' t you ?
something wrong ?
that song .
i know it .
yeah .
they all do .
hey , evelyn .
you were right as rain .
you got a visitor today .
hope she' s some help to your troubles .
ten minutes .
my name' s rachel .
but you know that .
some days i sort of have a feeling .
a feeling ?
this is about your child .
it' s ...
it' s about yours .
samara .
they don' t dream , you know .
the dead don' t dream .
look , something' s happened to my son .
you have to sleep to dream .
it has to do with your daughter .
and the dead never sleep .
they wait ... ... and watch for a way back .
but they never sleep .
that' s why dreams are safe .
i' m sorry , i just ...
i don' t have a lot of time .
please , i need your help .
i have to know .
can you tell me ?
why did you try to kill your baby ?
why ?
because my baby told me to .
just like yours will tell you .
and you have to do it .
you have to send it back .
what ?
they stopped me .
don' t let them stop you .
what ?
listen to the voices .
what are you talking about ?
because it' s our fault .
we did it .
yes .
we did it .
yes .
it was you .
it was you !
you did it !
what did i do ?
evelyn , that' s enough .
i love my son .
come on .
it' s all right .
i' m sorry , ma' am , that' s enough for today .
let' s go .
what did i do ?
you let the dead get in .
let' s go .

like , if she' d been hurting you somehow .
