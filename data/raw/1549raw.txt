hello ?
anyone here ?
hello .
numbers ... where' s the goddamn numbers ?
there' s something ...
oh shit .
i mean , they' re my numbers ...
damn !
don' t i at least get a shot with my numbers , you stupid fucks ? !
i want a chance !
i want a chance like everyone else .
oh my god .
oh , you bastards .
our father which art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come , thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven .
give us this day our daily bread , and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors .
lead us not into temptation ...
lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil .
for thine ... is the kingdom ... and the power ... and the glory , forever and ever .
amen .
hello ?
are you all right ?
can you hear me ?
are you hurt ?
don' t move .
don' t make a sound .
i said , " don' t move .
are you alone ?
blink once for yes , twice for no .
is there anyone else in the other room ?
all right .
all right .
i' m going to release you .
but i can take you down again , as quick as the first time .
so don' t scream , understand ?
once for yes , twice for no .
are you alone ?
all right .
all right .
what the hell do you think you' re doing ?
how many rooms have you been in ?
what is this place ?
i don' t know .
you tell me , how many rooms you' ve been in ?
i don' t know , five or six .
what about you ?
uh ... this is my third .
you sure you didn' t see anyone else ?
no .
have you ?
no .
so who are you ?
who are you ?
what the fuck are those noises ?
relax .
this is just for show .
pretend that you' re scared .
should be easy .
all right .
get down here now , or she' s dead .
some hero .
i have that effect on men .
glad to see you haven' t lost your sense of humor .
is this really necessary ?
just hang on .
isn' t that the same ...
yes .
hey !
come back !
wait .
jesus christ .
hey !
wait !
where the fuck do you think you' re going ?
this guy sure moves quickly .
he' s just gone .
maybe something made him go , maybe you should come back .
this place is awful .
please don' t hurt me .
don' t be frightened .
don' t worry .
there' s nobody else here .
just me .
i' m kate .
what' s your name ?
sasha .
that' s a beautiful name .
don' t worry .
everything' s going to be all right , okay ?
do you understand me ?
i' m just blind , not retarded .
finally .
i was beginning to wonder if i was the only one in here .
i kept hoping i would find some other people .
i' ve been wondering around these rooms for hours .
stay away from me !
no one' s going to hurt you .
well , certainly not .
no .
no .
i come in peace , young lady .
i' m jerry .
this is sasha .
she' s blind .
and she' s very scared .
what a bummer , to be blind in this place .
do you know what this place is ?
no .
no .
no .
i don' t suppose , either of you two could
let me know what we' re doing in here ?
no .
oh ...
jerry whitehall .
kate filmore .
what are you doing ?
i' m marking the rooms .
this is the fourth room you' ve been in ?
yeah .
i thought you said you' ve been wandering these rooms for hours .
yeah .
that' s the weird thing isn' t it ?
each one of these rooms , has six of these doors , or portals .
but no matter how many portals i go through ,
i always wound up in the same three rooms .
until now .
it' s as if the rooms were moving around or something .
yeah .
but i don' t feel any motion , do you ?
no .
it' s just so strange .
i ran into this guy ...
oh no .
it' s getting closer !
what is ?
i don' t know .
something' s coming after us , and i don' t think it likes us .
i don' t hear any people .
i think it' s just motors .
he wants us dead .
we have to get out of here right now .
any suggestion on which way to go next ?
your guess is as good as mine .
i don' t know .
please , we have to move !
uh ... here .
okay .
sasha , we' re going to have to climb a bit of a ladder .
hold on to me .
move quickly .
get me out of here !
help !
help me !
oh god !
there' s a guy hanging .
i can' t hold him much longer !
okay .
i' m coming .
oh my god .
what' s happening ?
hurry !
hang on .
hang on .
hang on .
grab his ...
i' m coming .
i' m coming .
here ...
good girl .
good girl .
sasha , you' re going to be okay .
just stay here .
you' re going to be okay .
there you are .
you' ve found some friends , huh ?
help me get him down .
fantastic .
give me some space .
i' m here .
i can grab his legs .
i' m loosening the belt .
all right .
all right .
i got him .
i' m losing it .
ready , you got it ?
yeah .
hurry .
there it goes .
i know you want a cigarette , but not yet .
slowly .
easy .
i' ve got his legs .
lean him up against this wall .
okay .
watch his head .
that' s it .
just make sure he' s upright .
he' s alive .
he' s breathing .
good .
he' s military .
colonel thomas h. maguire , department of defense ,
jesus christ .
he' s pentagon , hi tech liaison .
you ... how the hell would you know ?
a buddy of mine' s doing 10 20 upstate for cracking the mainframe on the pentagon two years ago .
i helped him write the code .
maybe that' s why i' m in here .
you know for sure we' re in prison ?
i' m assuming ...
you know what they say .
thanks .
that' s helpful .
jerry whitehall .
thanks .
simon grady .
that' s kate .
sasha .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t get your name .
max reisler .
thanks .
sasha ...
sasha ...
jerry , could you ...
sure , of course .
come on , sit him up .
let' s get you sitting up straight here .
sasha , you okay ?
this man' s been beaten badly .
he' s been tortured .
look at his hand .
cigarette burns .
jesus .
they' re coming for us next .
don' t you worry .
i won' t let anyone hurt you .
i hope it' s that easy , kate .
there' s nothing in here .
what do you think ?
i figure he knows something he didn' t want anyone to know .
that' s usually why people are tortured .
how do you know , mr. cigarette burns ?
what are you , an expert ?
as a matter of fact , you weedy little shit ...
they' re coming !
they' re coming !
they' re coming .
they' re coming .
oh , hello .
do you know where the showers are ?
i seem to be lost , again .
i always get lost in this gym .
i don' t know why my daughter in law insists on bringing me here .
it' s all the way across town .
whoa .
watch your step .
watch your step .
thank you , dear .
oh my goodness .
i' m afraid i can' t help you with the showers .
i' m jerry .
you' re not little jerry reisback , are you ?
no .
thank goodness .
he' s my paperboy , and i owe him $10 .
right .
well , this is simon .
kate and sasha .
hello .
and uh ...
max .
max .
max .
and you are ?
i' m mrs. paley .
how do you do mrs. paley ?
you don' t happen to know why you' re here , do you ?
oh dear .
i was never very good at philosophy .
do any of us know what' s going on here ?
sorry .
i' ve been trying to get a handle on the configuration of these rooms .
all i can say is ...
they just don' t make any sense .
that' s right .
they sure don' t .
it' s as if the rooms are moving around very quickly .
there' s got to be some kind of logic to it .
these rooms just seem to repeat .
you go in one direction , the room just loops back on itself .
it' s getting closer .
sasha , do you know what it is ?
not really .
but i can hear it .
all the time , even when you don' t .
and it sounds ... ... it feels wrong .
maybe we' re in hell .
all right ,
let' s get some real answers .
his answer was suicide .
not exactly a comforting thought .
soldier , up on your feet .
careful , he' s hurt .
come on , pumpkin , up you come .
stop it .
he' s in serious condition .
stop it .
listen to me , sweetheart ...
i' m not your sweetheart , asshole .
all right .
this man' s been tortured .
you want to be next when they come for us ?
who exactly are they ?
well , i' m going to find out .
come on .
stop it .
stop it .
are you trying to kill us ?
it' s not going to help us if he dies , you know ?
you' ve got no information whatsoever .
it' s here .
jesus ... what the fuck ? !
come on .
he' s conscious .
sit him up .
sit him up .
come on , soldier .
talk to me , soldier .
talk to me .
what' s going on here ?
are you speaking to me ?
yes .
jesus christ .
yes .
just tell me , how do we get out of here ?
i don' t know .
you figure out the code , you get out .
the first one had rules ...
the first one ?
what are you talking about ?
leave him alone .
he' s delirious .
he knows something , all right ?
i' il carry him myself , just ...
the first one had numbers ...
what do you mean , " the first one " ?
let him go .
i' m out of here .
oh my god .
are you okay ?
did you hit your head ?
yeah .
i slipped .
it' s a wall .
it wiggled .
you sure you' re okay ...
look .
there it goes again .
that ... that ... that ...
that' s ... that' s ...
i don' t know .
no !
holy fuck .
what is that ?
i don' t know .
but i don' t think we should stick around to find out .
come on , let' s go .
come on .
come on , sasha , i' m here .
i' m right behind you , honey .
hurry , let' s go !
easy , easy ...
for christ' s sake .
what the ...
come on .
there you go .
grab right there .
where are you ?
come on , colonel .
it' s time for us to go .
i' m not done with you yet .
i' m not going .
what did you do that for ?
i' m not going anywhere soon .
well , fuck you .
come on , kate .
let' s get out of here .
come on , where' s the key ?
do you have the key ?
you mean this ?
yeah .
no .
what did you do that for ?
you don' t honestly think you can escape ?
we have to try .
oh my god .
this is gonna hurt .
kate , get the hell up here !
no .
i' m not leaving without him .
for god' s sake , he' s a dead man .
move .
god .
there' s no time left .
let' s go .
oh my god .
there' s got to be a way .
get the ... get the hell out of there .
oh my god .
leave him , he' s dead .
oh my god .
let me go .
let me go .
it' s still coming .
come on .
so what the hell happened back there ?
i don' t know .
hello .
and where did you come from ?
what' s your name ?
i' m ...
i' m kate .
don' t you remember me ?
i' m mrs. paley .
the colonel was our only link to this place .
maybe not .
i designed the door panels in here .
the touch sensors .
what ?
i was freelancing for a subcontractor , i ...
you didn' t think this was worth mentioning before ?
i signed a confidentiality ...
given our current situation , i' d say it' s null and void .
jesus christ !
the legal ...
what the hell is this place ?
i don' t know .
you don' t think the guy that makes the toilets in the space shuttle , gets to see the plans for the rest of it ?
you must have had some idea what they were building .
it was experimental .
it was a prototype .
for what ?
i' m not sure .
for what ? !
leading edge stuff .
there were rumors ...
what kind of rumors , jerry ?
what rumors ?
quantum teleportation .
pardon ?
they were just rumors .
you mean , like ...
beam me up , scotty " ?
okay .
now this is getting ridiculous .
what do you know , jerry ?
nothing .
you' re lying .
why would i lie ?
because both you and the colonel work for them .
them ?
who the hell are " them " anyway ?
what ?
the government ?
the mafia ?
aliens ?
oh my goodness .
it' s a tesseract .
christ , she' s losing it .
isn' t it beautiful ?
isn' t what beautiful , mrs. paley ?
holy shit .
if you look at it from just the right angle ...
what did you call it again , mrs. paley ?
it' s a tesseract , sweetheart .
tesseract ?
tesseract .
it' s ...
it' s a tesseract .
how do you know it' s a tesser ... act , or whatever you call it ?
is the second act beginning already ?
we should be getting back to our seats .
excuse me .
yeah .
is she for real ?
a tesseract , holy christ , of course .
a tesseract .
jerry , you okay ?
yeah , yeah .
i can' t believe i didn' t see it before .
it' s been staring at us in the face the whole time .
maybe you could share with the rest of the class .
oh .
of course .
a tesseract ... it' s another name for ... ... a hypercube .
a what ?
a hypercube ... a four dimensional cube .
four dimensions ?
all the elements are there .
rooms repeating .
rooms folding in on themselves .
teleportation .
it could all very well add up .
look .
here .
see ?
let' s call one dimension , length , and represent that with a simple line .
now , two dimensions are length and width , which can be represented by a single square .
now if we extend that square , one more dimension ... we get ... a cube , which has three dimensions .
length , width , and depth .
come on , we' ve all passed the eighth grade .
hush .
here' s the really funky part .
if you take this cube , and extend it one more dimension , we get ...
a tesseract .
i thought time was considered to be the fourth dimension .
sure .
that' s one idea .
but what if you have a fourth spatial dimension ?
there' s no such thing .
why don' t you shut up ?
okay .
okay .
let' s just say that we are in this hyper ...
cube .
cube .
whatever .
does this diagram show us how to get out ?
well , uh ... no .
a hypercube isn' t supposed to be real .
it' s just a theoretical construct .
oh .
well that makes me feel better .
is there a theory on how we might get out of this ... theoretical construct ?
i don' t know .
don' t worry , dear .
it' s just a matter of time .
that' s so much clearer .
thank you .
great .
we are all ... unwilling participants ... in a game show , and are being videotaped as we speak .
although i don' t condone forcible abduction of innocent people , we can take comfort in the fact that once the show airs , we' il be able to parlay this into lucrative sponsorship deals .
okay , max .
and what' s the object of this game show ?
hmm ...
i don' t know .
to get out alive ?
i think we should make a map .
i don' t think a map is really going to help us .
look at that .
that wasn' t there a minute ago .
did you write that ?
no .
i left my wings at home .
i just marked this room as 10 before it .
somebody' s been here before us .
thanks .
a really large someone .
why go through the trouble of writing it on the ceiling ?
60, 659 rooms ?
christ .
this place must be huge .
oh yes , yes .
in a hypercube , there could be 60 million rooms .
she could be right .
there' s a comforting thought .
what the hell are you doing ?
yowza .
the ratings on this show just doubled .
what do you see ?
a girl .
oh jesus .
i' m going in .
i think i' m going to puke .
you all right ?
okay .
i just ... whoa ...
hey .
hey .
hey .
get back here .
what' s happening ?
what' s going on ?
help !
try to give me your hand .
help me !
you okay ?
what the hell is going on in there ?
max , don' t be an idiot .
come on back .
no , it' s okay .
the gravity shifted .
she needs help ,
she may be hurt .
wow .
are we going in there or what ?
maybe she knows something .
what about our ...
less agile members ?
i have an idea .
hello .
whoa .
i' m all right .
miss ?
hey , miss .
hey .
wake up .
she' s on her way .
i guess it' s time for plan b.
give her mouth to mouth and see if it works .
think i should ?
oh , very funny .
hi .
what' s wrong ?
what the hell ?
where am i ?
that' s the million dollar question .
does she have to keep cackling like that ?
come on , let' s get this over with .
all right .
this is going to be some kind of ...
yeah , mrs. paley .
just keep laughing there .
this is more fun than i' ve had since my thirteenth birthday .
glad somebody is having fun .
this reminds me of that rope swing we used to have at home .
for god' s sake , mrs. paley , this isn' t a game !
come on .
come on down .
simon , you guys , keep her steady .
all right , all right .
come on .
okay .
and you' re down .
that' s good .
it' s okay .
she' s down .
we' ve landed .
yeah .
it' s your turn , you' il have to climb around the sides .
well , this is a lot like the other ones , isn' t it ?
christ .
this is going to be fun .
hello there .
i' m mrs. paley .
who the hell are you people ? !
well ...
i' m kate , and this is mrs. paley .
and i am julia .
and this is ...
hey .
is this your jacket ?
no .
well then how did i ...
i must have had more to drink last night than i thought .
there' s nothing in here .
how the hell did i get here ?
have we been kidnapped ?
that' s a really good question .
does anyone remember how we got here ?
last thing i remember was going to sleep .
where ?
in my bed .
where do you live ?
lincoln , nebraska .
kate , i am a healthy , married , male white engineer , who enjoys reading horror novels and eating chocolate ice cream , as well as climbing around psycho jungle gyms .
okay .
i remember driving home from maine state hospital .
it was late , and i just wanted to get home ,
i' ve been working long hours .
i' m a psychotherapist .
simon .
new haven .
i was out for a drink .
what do you do ?
a consultant .
management consultant .
yeah , right .
and i' m santa claus .
okay , max .
how about you ?
i live in palo alto .
i design computer games .
the last thing i remember , i fell asleep on my keyboard .
sasha .
and where do you live ?
new mexico .
i was doing my homework in the kitchen , like i always do .
nothing ever happens to me .
the last thing i remember ... is taking the dog for a walk .
julia ?
i was at an after party for a premiere in santa monica .
are you an actress ?
no .
no , i' m an attorney .
let' s just say if i was kidnapped it was for the ransom .
so we' ve got silicon valley , connecticut , nebraska ,
hollywood , maine .
mrs. paley , where exactly do you live ?
in that high rise at the corner of riverside and 94th .
could you give me a lift home , dear ?
i seem to have lost my daughter in law .
ignorance is bliss .
this doesn' t make any sense .
yeah , well ...
i think they probably flew us here .
drugged us and flew us out here in private or military jets .
that' s what i think .
where is here ?
i don' t know .
your guess is as good as mine .
they could have built an hypercube structure anywhere .
and if this thing really does fold space , we could be literately anywhere .
what the hell ...
what ?
here is that number again .
6 0 6 5 9
this can' t be the same room .
jesus !
it' s not , because now they' re in a string of other numbers .
there just can' t be that many rooms .
maybe they are not room numbers .
maybe somebody else figured something out .
we are definitely not alone .
check this out .
what is it ?
what' s happening ?
julia , is that your watch ?
no .
no , it' s mine .
it ...
well , this is bizarre .
what , somebody else uses a watch just like yours ?
somebody is playing games with us .
shit ... look ... this is the watch that my wife gave me on my 40th .
see ?
this is the watch we' ve just found .
maybe it' s your game that we are playing , jerry .
you designed the doors , your watch .
what' s next ?
no , i ...
for the love of god , mrs. paley ...
mrs. paley , please don' t .
oh , my goodness , i think he' s still alive .
mrs. paley , please .
get her down .
easy , careful .
is somebody in there ?
what do you see ?
jerry ?
oh , god .
there' s a guy down here .
oh !
the gravity' s shifting .
what' s happening ?
you okay ?
are you all right ?
simon , what' s going on ?
my god .
hey , hey , fellow .
oh , jesus .
be careful .
ugh !
is he alive ?
i don' t think so .
let' s roll him over .
yeah , yeah ...
oh god , is he ripe .
what ... what is that ?
oh !
it looks pretty dead to me .
i hope he' s still alive .
he' s been here for a while , mrs. paley .
oh , poor man .
who do you think wrote these numbers ?
he must have written them himself , it' s all upside down .
it' s the same writing as those numbers we keep seeing .
oh , no !
it' s poor dr. rosenzweig .
you know him ?
he' il never get his nobel prize now .
who the hell is he ?
holy christ ...
phil rosenzweig .
last year he was the leading theoretical physicist in his field .
which was ?
quantum chaos .
oh god , phil rosenzweig .
i read his book ...
oh jesus .
oh my god .
is he ... ?
kate , is he ... ?
yeah , he' s gone .
you are positive ?
uh huh .
somebody ... ?
i' m here , sasha .
got you .
does anyone understand these numbers ?
what was he writing ?
beats me .
may be he was trying to calculate his way out of here .
looks like he ran out of time .
how did old mrs. paley know him ?
i don' t know .
hey , look .
more numbers .
same handwriting .
the question is , did he solve it before he died ?
god .
she' s okay .
are you okay ?
he must have finished it here .
look , there it is again ... 6 0 6 5 9 .
how does that get us out of here ?
it' s got to mean something .
yeah , but what ?
i don' t know , but we better remember it .
you know , i wonder if is he' s got a ...
what are you doing ?
that' s disgusting .
found a pen .
hope you have better luck than he did .
oh no , this can' t be happening .
oh dear .
oh dear , just wait .
oh , i' m such an idiot .
oh , no .
wait a minute .
she' s gonna drive me insane .
oh , it was right here .
what is it , mrs. paley ?
izon , where are you ?
i' m such an idiot .
did she say izon ?
izon , where are you ?
you come back here this instant .
who are you looking for mrs. paley ?
have you seen my dog ?
he' s a darling little shi tzu .
darn it .
her dog' s name is " izon " ?
that' s weird .
i thought izon was a ...
a weapons manufacturer .
yes .
and you guys would know that because ...
i read the papers .
mrs. paley ...
poor puppy ...
mrs. paley , are you sure you didn' t leave the dog at home ?
no .
he was right here .
i' m such an idiot .
this breaks my heart .
mrs. paley ...
mrs. paley , what do you do for living ?
oh , nothing .
i' m retired .
i shouldn' t have let him off the leash .
before you retired , what did you do ?
nothing very exciting .
i was a theoretical mathematician .
where did you work ?
oh , my head hurts .
at skippy research affiliates ... what do they called it ?
a think tank in washington state .
she worked for skippy research affiliates and her dog' s name was izon ?
mrs. paley ?
hmm ?
is it possible that you worked for izon research affiliates and your dog' s name is skippy ?
how did you know where i worked ?
oh , god .
she worked for a weapons manufacturer ?
she' s a good friend of our nobel wanna be .
i don' t think we should trust mrs. funnyfarm .
i' m not crazy , and i' m not hard of hearing either .
i told you no one would believe me .
mrs. paley , what sort of research did you do at izon ?
general , i will not be party to this insanity !
i' m not a general .
i don' t care what alex trusk says .
it' s impossible .
and what' s more , it' s inhuman .
who' s alex ?
did she say alex trusk ?
oh christ .
we' re dead .
this is really getting ridiculous .
who' s alex trusk ?
alex trusk ?
hacker extraordinare ?
he' s a legend .
this is exactly the kind of twisted maze he' d create .
alex trusk doesn' t even exist .
some things should never be created .
they exist for theoretical purposes only .
it would never last .
can' t you understand that ?
okay , you' re a shrink .
can you tell me what the hell' s happening ?
i ... umm ...
i' d say that seeing the dead man triggered some sort of emotional response .
flashbacks , post traumatic stress ...
so she is connected to this , yeah ?
skippy ...
ooh , i think i hear him .
skippy ?
mrs. paley , mrs. paley , don' t ...
skippy ?
mrs. paley .
oh my .
help me , please .
uh , uh .
no , don' t trust the old cunt .
she lied about everything .
what a ...
jesus .
what just happened ?
it took my head , man .
i lost my fucking head !
paley opened ... the portal ...
wait , wait , i have an idea .
i think we' re all tired .
we need to calm down , everybody .
hold it .
wait a minute !
i have an idea .
let me guess , you designed the floor too .
you better have a really good fucking explanation , jerry .
i know what just happened there was a little ... shocking , but it actually makes total sense if we' re ... in a really multi dimensional quantum environment .
english , please .
one fundamental idea of a quantum universe , is that parallel realities can actually exist simultaneously .
how do you know that , jerry ?
all you designed were the door panels !
i read it in rosenzweig book , it was a big part of this theory .
what if whoever designed this stinking thing somehow managed to create a place where parallel realities can crossover like that ?
so you are saying we just saw simon and mrs. paley
in a parallel universe ?
yes , yes !
stop it !
a universe where things turn out a little differently .
fuck .
uh , please .
think about it , think about it .
a few minutes before ,
when you found the watch , yeah .
and we realized that somebody else had been marking numbers in the rooms , right ?
that' s when i thought maybe we should leave markers behind , in case we doubled back and got side tracked .
things like a piece of clothing or jewelry .
i think what a pity it would be to leave my watch .
but i would do it if i had to .
you' re saying that in an alternate reality we' d already gotten ourselves into such trouble that you decided that is okay to leave your watch ?
yes !
for crying out loud !
what a load of crap !
there' s got to be a logical explanation .
what would you think that is ?
this is just an optical illusion or something ?
yeah , sure .
why not ?
finally , yeah .
a sane idea .
oh , that' s a sane idea .
all right .
if max is right , why don' t you go and open that door ?
oh , come on .
have a look .
excuse me ?
if you' re so sure it' s an optical illusion , open the door and have a look .
you might want to stand to the side , in case that thing ...
fuck off , jerry !
okay , hold it !
all right ?
don' t open it .
say jerry' s right ,
i think all of this is a hoax , okay ?
i think jerry' s either full of shit or part of this experiment .
simon , i never ...
shut the fuck up !
i' m agreeing with you , max .
i think we' re all pumped so full of lsd and i think we' re hidden in some cla hospital in area 51 , or whatever .
but let' s just say , on the off chance that jerry is actually right .
then what happens if whatever the fuck it was in there that killed the guy , killed me , what happens if that fucking thing gets in here ? !
what happens then ? !
you' re all crazy .
hey , man , what are you doing ?
just don' t fucking open the door .
what are you so scared of anyway ?
i just saw my fucking head taken off by something or other .
how' s that for starters ?
where did you get that knife ?
it' s mine .
i collect knives .
he had it when i first saw him .
he sure did .
that' s convenient .
he' s the only guy with a knife here , if anyone was a part of the experiment ... maybe you .
i know !
i know !
i' ve got it !
i' ve got it !
why don' t we all just get some ice cream and everyone will feel a lot better about everything ?
you' re funny , mrs. paley .
you really are a funny old lady .
you' re also cute and senile .
you leave her alone , she doesn' t understand .
all right , she' s already admitted working for izon , one of the most powerful weapons manufacturers in the world .
she recognized the figures on the wall , and she knew the dead guy .
no .
maybe my alter ego wasn' t all that wrong .
maybe we shouldn' t trust dear old mrs. paley .
maybe you' re the one we shouldn' t trust .
i beg your pardon ?
maybe you' re the one we shouldn' t trust .
oh .
i' m going to ignore that , little girl , because you' re a cripple .
i think we should keep moving , huh ?
after you .
kate , i' m really thirsty .
me too , sweetheart .
me too .
i' m exhausted .
are we there yet ?
come on , mrs. paley .
just hold on a little longer .
who' s this alex trusk person ?
are you kidding ?
he programmed the virus that crashed the tokyo stock exchange two years ago .
he' s the one that broke into the air traffic control grid , and crashed those two air force jets in nevada to protest military spending .
you forgot the one about alex trusk being the first genetically engineered superhuman , bred in a test tube , who now lives and walks amongst us .
that sounds a bit far fetched .
don' t worry .
alex trusk is a conspiracy theorist' s wet dream .
he doesn' t exist .
fine .
just keep fooling yourself .
would you people just shut up and keep moving ?
do you really believe this stuff about parallel universes ?
if you asked me yesterday , i' d say no .
but this place changes your perception about what' s possible .
look , let' s just keep this between us for now .
yeah .
okay .
here' s the deal .
i' m a private investigator .
i' m on a case , missing persons .
given our current situation , this counts as irony .
you' re right .
i think they stuck me in here because of her ...
becky young .
they' ve emptied my pockets except for my knife and this .
maybe it' s a message or a warning .
here' s the kicker .
guess who she worked for ?
izon ?
kate .
kate .
kate , you have to wake up , there' s ...
what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
there' s something here .
do you see anything ?
you' re probably just dreaming or some ...
whoa .
there is ... there is something .
what the hell is that ?
kate .
kate , what do you see ?
it' s a square .
it' s just floating .
what is it ?
it' s beautiful .
you recognize this too , mrs. paley ?
well , not exactly ...
what just happened ?
now there' s two .
it' s multiplying .
oh my god ...
maybe it' s the way out .
oh .
wow .
if we' re drunk , i wanna know what this stuff is .
maybe that' s what a four dimensional object looks like .
if that' s the way out , how do we use it ?
i hate it .
it sounds wrong .
it' s stunning .
the math of it .
it' s a perfect quadrangular oscillation .
it' s moving .
mrs. paley , no !
ahh .
get the fuck out of the way !
jerry , you' re hurt .
no .
i' m okay .
look out .
stay low .
whoa !
go on .
come on , mrs. paley .
it' s time to go .
over here .
it looks safe .
don' t stare at it .
go .
it' s coming back .
come on , max .
go , julia .
go .
i want to get it .
no .
we' ve got to go .
oh my god .
go .
go up the stairs .
come on , mrs. paley .
keep going ...
kate !
sasha .
jerry .
oh jesus !
no .
sasha .
no .
just don' t do it .
just get in here .
what the fuck are you doing ?
kate !
she' s gone .
you want to end up like jerry ?
sasha .
kate !
kate , i' m here .
kate .
you' re a dead woman .
oh ... oh jesus .
sasha .
kate , help .
kate , help !
i' m coming to get you .
help me !
drop to the ground , sasha .
now .
help me .
okay , sasha .
now ... uh ...
i can see you , sasha .
flatten yourself against the wall , on the ground .
crawl towards me .
no .
i can' t .
i' m scared .
you' ve gotta move , or i can' t come and get you .
move towards me .
no .
stop , sasha !
don' t , sasha .
get down .
damn it , kate , what do you want me to do ?
just keep moving until you hit that corner , and then stay put .
okay ?
sasha ?
okay ?
i' m almost there .
just crawl on .
keep your side to the ground .
you can do it .
you' ve made it .
i' m right behind you .
there you are .
keep your knees in .
kate , thank god .
there you are .
you' re okay .
you' re okay ...
what just happened ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know , sasha .
sweet jesus .
it' s shrinking so it can get us .
please let it be quick .
okay .
we' re going to make a run for it .
i can' t .
yes you can .
just hold onto me .
we' re going to go to our right .
no .
we' re going to go to the left .
all right ?
okay ?
okay .
on the count of three ... just hold on to me .
one , two , three ...
i' ve got you .
oh my god !
sasha , no .
it responds to our movements .
don' t move .
stay still .
don' t ...
oh my god .
is it gone ?
yeah .
it' s gone .
thank you .
we did it together .
let' s get out of here before it comes back .
my glasses .
you' re glasses are gone .
just go up the ladder .
kate .
yeah ?
what ?
i can smell it .
what ?
did someone die in here ?
yeah .
yeah .
jerry died .
oh no .
he was so nice .
we' ve got to go .
we' ve got to go , honey .
just get up there .
one foot after the other .
where are the others ?
i think we' re on our own .
you' re doing good .
i see a pattern .
anyone connected to this ... this hypercube ... eventually dies a very violent , and painful death .
i would hate for that to happen to you , mrs. paley .
i would .
so drop the act and tell us how we get out of here .
huh ?
simon .
simon , that' s enough .
shut up .
hey , simon ...
shut up .
okay .
okay , mrs. paley .
you ready to talk ?
' cause i' m all ears .
i really don' t need this operation , doctor .
i' m in perfect health .
just ask my daughter in law over there .
she' il explain .
this joke' s really getting stale .
i' m going to give you one more chance , mrs. paley .
you tell me what i need to know , or i' m going to have to kill you .
do you understand ?
i' m going to kill you .
it' s your choice .
get away from her !
you have a choice to make .
right now .
do you want to get out of here or not ?
yes , but ...
there are no buts !
hey guys , maybe ...
all right .
oh shit .
it' s here .
it' s gonna take my head off .
let' s go .
what about mrs. paley ?
goddamn it .
i' m not gonna die here .
you can' t leave her .
why should i help her ?
she' il die .
forget about her .
i' m gonna regret this .
julia !
i' m trying to get this off .
come on .
hurry .
shit !
would someone give me a hand ?
would somebody help me pick her up ?
shit !
let go of me .
shit !
i' m not staying here .
i' m out of here .
let go of me .
jesus christ .
oh my god .
oh god .
where do you think you' re going ?
hurry up .
get back here .
what the hell ?
6 0 6 5 9 .
it could mean anything .
right .
maybe it' s a coordinate of some kind but in four dimensions .
some ...
i don' t know .
for all we know , it could be somebody' s birthday , or a zip code , or just a serial number .
i wish i was just ... smarter .
why do you think you' re in here ?
i don' t know .
maybe i was just in the wrong place at the wrong time .
damn it .
there' s got to be some sort of meaning to this .
6 0 6 5 9 .
6 0 6 5 9 .
maybe they just like to watch us squirm .
alex trusk is the only one with the resources and brains to create something like this .
okay , max .
say you' re right .
say it is alex trusk who' s responsible for all of this .
does it help us get out ?
no , we' re still stuck here , with no clue .
and if this is someone' s game , it isn' t a fair one .
max , do you think ...
we' ve got to keep moving .
come on .
max ?
max , what' s wrong with you ?
holy shit !
variable time speed rooms .
pretty wild .
i guess you could say that .
holy jumping jesus !
get your hands off me .
hello , jerry .
who the hell are you ?
you don' t recognize me ?
where am i ?
how do you know my name ?
you don' t know me ?
no .
where the hell am i ?
you don' t ... ?
wait , wait .
you don' t remember me ?
no .
what about the senile old broad ,
or the little blind kid ?
what ?
or that thing that chopped you up like little pieces of deli fucking meat ?
i' m a friend ...
i mean you no harm .
let me go , and i' il be on my way .
no come on , you ...
you mean me no harm ?
you' re fucking hilarious , jerry .
how long have you been in here ?
i don' t know .
i just woke up .
you just woke up ?
holy shit !
holy shit .
maybe you were right before , huh ?
you or the ... whatever ...
this place does crossover parallel alternate realities , huh ?
have you been drinking ?
i really don' t give a shit anymore .
we are talking about alternate realities .
can i ask you a question ?
do you mind ?
yeah , okay , sure ... just don' t hurt me , huh ?
are you hungry ?
are you ... hungry ?
yeah , i guess ... my stomach' s ...
' cause i am hungry .
i' m fucking starving .
oh my god .
kate , what is it ?
kate ?
what do you see ?
kate , what' s going on ?
i don' t know .
i mean ...
i think in some other reality , things didn' t turn out so well .
again with the alex trusk ?
why are you so afraid of this alex trusk ?
because he' s ruthless .
he' s a hi tech genius whose morals make muammar qaddafi
look like mother teresa .
why are you panicking ?
because he' s throwing anybody connected to this thing in here to fucking die !
max , you' re not connected .
can you keep a secret ?
sure .
i love secrets .
i designed a computer game called " relativity , " where contestants linked to each over the internet do battle in a 3 d environment , using different time signatures .
what are you saying ?
are you saying that you designed all this ?
no .
just these variable time speeds rooms .
just the concept .
it was for a game .
now here we are .
wow .
this is really some game , max .
do you have other little secrets you want to tell me ?
people are dead , okay ?
i' m not responsible for this .
it was just a game .
i can' t even sell the stupid thing .
it' s all involved in a lawsuit .
what kind of lawsuit ?
i don' t know , some ...
right , you' re a lawyer .
a company called cyber thrill stole it from me .
cyber thrill ?
you' ve heard of them ?
yeah .
are you into computer games ?
settle .
excuse me ?
i strongly recommend that you settle .
you' il never win .
how do you know that ?
because ... you' re not up against cyber thrill .
they' re just a subsidiary .
who owns them ?
izon .
how do you know that ?
because i ... represent them .
i must be hearing things .
finally .
i was wondering if i was the only one in here .
do you need a hand there ?
you are upside down .
do you have any idea what' s going on here ?
be careful .
watch your step .
crazy .
you are not the only person here , jerry .
there' s lots of people just like you .
how do you know my name ?
we' ve met before , jerry .
i get this mouth watering feeling when i talk to you .
what do you mean ?
come here , look at this .
hey , hey .
agh !
agh , no !
take this !
and this !
why don' t you just go ?
i' m blind , kate .
i' m a burden .
you can move faster without me .
sasha , please , i know how you' re feeling .
no you don' t .
you have no idea how i' m feeling .
i know this seems hopeless it is hopeless .
no , it' s not .
i' m gonna figure this out .
figure it out .
trust me , precious .
if i haven' t figured it out , you sure as shit aren' t going to .
what did you just say ?
i' m sorry , kate .
i didn' t mean to ...
no , no .
wait a second .
back that up .
why do you think that you should be able to figure this out ?
i wasn' t kidnapped .
when i found out they were putting people in here ,
i tried to blow the whistle on them .
so they came after me .
i escaped into the one place they wouldn' t dare follow me ... in here .
poetic justice , don' t you think ?
who are you ?
max was right .
jerry was wrong .
i exist .
oh my god .
sasha .
of course .
sasha is the nickname for alexandra .
alex trusk .
pleased to make your acquaintance .
damn it .
this is the worst nightmare i' ve ever had .
i just i wish i' d wake up .
you really think this is all a dream ?
definitely .
in the real world i' d never kiss you .
oh , really ?
yeah , you' re not my type .
you' re not my type , either .
aa ah !
ya aa !
becky young .
yeah .
rebecca young .
yeah .
who ... are you ?
who am i ?
i' m simon grady .
your parents hired me to find you .
really ?
yeah .
thank god .
yeah .
i' m happy to see you too , becky .
i really am .
i' ve been wandering these rooms for hours .
ahhgh !
you gotta love these parallel universes .
you built this thing ?
i gave them the key to build it ... better than they wanted .
i gave them a real hypercube .
how do we get out ?
kate , this isn' t a game .
there' s no happy ending .
this place is out of control .
it' s not stable .
does this number mean nothing ?
6 0 6 5 9 .
it' s got to mean something .
it' s everywhere .
i' m sorry , kate .
it' s over .
no , it is not over .
not yet .
i refuse to die here .
what the hell ?
oh my god .
we' ve got to move .
come on .
we' ve got to get out of here .
leave me .
no , you' re coming with me .
oh my god .
we got to get out of here .
just go up as fast as you can .
faster , faster .
keep going .
okay .
good girl .
what the hell ?
oh my god .
okay , we' ve got to get out of here .
this is insane .
it' s jerry' s diagram .
it' s all the numbers .
they' re all just suddenly in here .
it' s jerry' s markings ... that dead physicist' s equations ... and that damn colonel' s corpse , just hanging there as if we never even rescued him ?
everything keeps appearing over and over again .
sasha ... please , you have to have some idea what this means .
all the realities are starting to collapse into one space .
and what happens to us when they ... " it " collapses ?
the whole thing implodes .
it' s only a matter of time .
i' m not gonna just stand here while it happens .
i' m not leaving him behind .
oh my god .
kate !
let me go .
get the hell up here !
oh my god .
kate .
we don' t have much time .
no .
i refuse to die here .
i wish i had your spirit .
hello , gorgeous .
miss me ?
huh ?
come on in .
the water' s fine .
agh !
hello , kate .
let her go .
who are you ?
yeah , it' s me ... good old simon .
do you remember this ?
do you ?
i' ve waited a long time for pay back .
that was just ... seconds ago .
don' t be so stupid , kate .
time works differently in this place .
hey , just ... okay .
just let her go .
she' s just a kid .
she' il be a dead little kid , unless you come here to papa .
okay .
just let her go ... we can figure something out , okay ?
you take her place .
what do you want ?
i' m hungry .
simon ?
huh ?
there' s no point .
we' re all dead anyway .
oh , oh .
okay .
no !
oh , come on kate .
the fun' s just beginning .
oh my god .
what the hell ?
yah !
agh !
i' m really gonna miss you .
jesus ...
of course , 6 0 6 5 9 .
it' s an expiration date .
he figured out when it' s gonna implode .
leave me .
hello , kate .
welcome back .
so , you figured it out .
yes , sir .
no time to spare .
the device ... any luck ?
we' il take that to darcy and see if anything recorded on it .
sir ?
yes , sir .
phase two is terminated .
i see .
yes , sir .
right away , sir .
