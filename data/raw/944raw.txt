there' s great wisdom in jokes , falk , really .
there' s an old joke about a prizefighter in the ring .
he' s getting his brains beat out .
and his mother' s in the audience , and she' s watching him getting beaten up .
there' s a priest next to her and she says , " father , pray for him .
and the priest says , " i will , but if he could punch , it would help .
there' s more insight in that joke , into what i call the giant so what than most books on philosophy .
women .
camus said that women are all that we' re ever going to know of paradise on earth .
in your case , falk , there is a seminal joke that henny youngman used to tell that i think is perfect .
it sums it up perfectly as far as you go .
guy comes into a doctor' s office .
he says , " doc , it hurts when i do this .
the doctor says , " don' t do it .
think about that .
that' s david dobel , and i' m jerry falk .
we spent many afternoons walking and talking in the park .
did i know when i first met him how nuts he was ?
we met at the office of some so called intellectual comedian' s agent .
we were comedy writers trying to break into the business by writing nightclub routines for comics .
the difference was , i was 21 and he was 60 .
he wants truisms .
not just jokes .
truisms .
we can' t afford the crazy prices for the more established ...
let me say this , if i may .
i can' t speak for david dobel because i don' t handle him .
in fact , jerry and i just met him now .
but i' ve handled jerry falk since he began , and with jerry falk , you get top quality goods for your money .
you can buy a suit and get the same cut in a cheap fabric as you can in an expensive fabric .
jerry gives you affordable fabric , a quality fabric , at affordable prices .
is this gabardine ?
who is that piece goods salesman who handles you ?
harvey ?
don' t ask .
my cross to bear .
i' d love to dump him , but i' m his only client .
you pay that troll ten percent of your salary ?
20 .
actually , 25 .
it' s a long story .
he was there for me when my marriage broke up .
your ... don' t tell me you got married young .
you thought it would be exciting .
it turned out to be hebetudinous and you dumped her .
am i right ?
you are not .
she left me .
i can' t leave anybody .
it' s my main problem in analysis .
i' m afraid to sleep alone .
hebetudinous ?
you' re in analysis already ?
yes .
very committed , actually .
i turned down some tv jobs in los angeles because my shrink felt we weren' t finished yet .
you chose psychoanalysis over real life ?
are you learning disabled ?
obviously , you' re not familiar with analysis .
wrong .
i' m completely familiar with it .
similar hustlers tried to fob it off on me at payne whitney .
you were in payne whitney ?
that' s right .
a nuthouse .
i was in the psycho ward for six months , a vacation i don' t look back on with great nostalgia .
really ?
relax .
you don' t have to move away .
oh , no .
i' m not suggesting you were violent .
but i was violent .
that' s why they put you in a straitjacket .
you were in a straitjacket ?
i' m not going to take an ax and split your head open .
don' t be scared .
i' m just surprised .
what happened ?
why were you there ?
i broke up with this girl , and they put me with a psychiatrist who said ,
why did you get so depressed ,
and do all those things you did ?
i said , " i wanted this girl and she left me .
and he said , " well , we have to look into that .
and i said , " there' s nothing to look into !
i wanted her and she left me .
and he said , " well , why are you feeling so intense ?
and i said , " cause i want the girl !
and he said , " what' s underneath it ?
and i said , " nothing !
he said , " i' il have to give you medication .
i said , " i don' t want medication !
i want the girl !
and he said , " we have to work this through .
so , i took a fire extinguisher from the casement and struck him across the back of his neck .
and before i knew it , guys from con ed had jumper cables in my head and the rest was ...
why are you in analysis ?
you' re afraid to sleep alone .
what else ?
fear of death .
that' s funny .
i have that , too !
my dog has it .
it' s very common to living creatures .
and i have rough patches with my girlfriend .
you have a girlfriend ?
i am deeply in love .
really ?
yes , with the most beautiful , charming , sexy ...
but there are rough patches .
we' il get through them .
but there are painful conflicts .
she can be difficult .
but you' d love her .
she' s a knockout .
a knockout , but impossible .
i never said impossible .
you did !
difficult .
she can be difficult .
now she' s difficult .
soon , she' il be impossible .
she' s very supportive of my goals .
what are these goals ?
i want to write a novel .
a novel about man' s fate in the empty universe .
no god , no hope , just human suffering and loneliness .
stick to jokes , that' s where the money is .
want a lift ?
no , i' m okay .
i' m meeting my girlfriend .
today is our anniversary .
you know , maybe next week , if you' d like , we could drive out to watch that intellectual comedian parade his amphigories for us .
sure .
that' d be great .
it' s funny .
i was once in a cab ... this was years ago .
and i was pouring my heart out to the driver about all the stuff you were prattling on about ...
iife , death , the empty universe , the meaning of existence , human suffering .
you know , it' s like anything else .
think about that .
he was a teacher who lived on roosevelt lsland .
public school .
too frightened to quit and write comedy full time because , as he said , he knew what it was to starve .
amphigories " ?
hebetudinous " ?
meanwhile , i' m on my way to meet amanda .
i' il be on time , she' il be late .
she' s late , she' s disorganized .
incidentally , that' s not our big problem .
she drives me crazy , but wait till you meet her .
she is adorable !
jerry !
amanda !
hey !
am i late ?
not if we go by rocky mountain time .
can you pay for the cab ?
i forgot my wallet .
pay for the cab ?
are you getting the picture ?
you know , we did say 7 : 30 .
sorry !
it was pretty tough to get a reservation .
what' s the matter ?
i' m in a bad mood .
i can see .
why ?
i did terribly at an audition today .
you always think you did badly .
i felt so confident until i got up to read , then i completely froze .
don' t obsess .
i' m sure it wasn' t that bad .
i' m my own worst enemy .
i could play that part in my sleep .
i know you can .
just calm down .
we' il go have a good dinner .
we' il have wine , you can relax .
i got to tell you about this character i met .
he' s fascinating .
don' t be mad at me , but i ate .
you ate ?
i was starving when i got back from the audition , so i had a little sliver of that sara lee cheesecake .
then i had another one .
you know what i' m like when i get started .
pretty soon , i' d eaten the whole cake .
you ate the whole sara lee cheesecake ?
then i figured , what the hell !
i finished the spaghetti in the refrigerator , ate that last lobster tail and heated up a chicken pot pie .
is there any furniture left in the house ?
i' m so fat , it' s disgusting .
how could you eat before dinner ?
i' m sorry .
i was so angry at myself for screwing up .
i couldn' t help it .
i reserved a corner booth .
it' s okay .
you can order and i' il get a club soda .
i' m dieting anyway .
i can' t take their best booth with just one of us eating .
it' s not nice .
it' s fine .
no , it' s not .
it' s dinner hour .
the restaurant' s jam packed .
how does it look ?
why do you always care what other people think ?
it' s embarrassing if just one of us eats .
okay .
i' il order a meal and i just won' t eat it .
i can' t do that .
so order me a steak , i' il get a doggie bag , and it' il be my insomnia snack .
what kind of anniversary dinner is that ?
can i have one dinner , and can you put a steak in a doggie bag ?
i thought we' d sit over some wine and i' d look in your eyes and tell you how beautiful you are .
i' m not beautiful .
i' m fat .
okay , i' il cancel the reservation .
let' s go home .
i' il make myself some eggs or something .
there are no more eggs .
i ate them .
what are you doing ?
i made myself a sandwich .
there were some cans of tuna left .
thank god she hasn' t learned how to use the new electric can opener yet .
my mother' s moving in with us .
what ?
i' m so angry at her .
wait a minute .
did i miss something ?
she left her boyfriend .
what happened ?
i thought she was finally settled .
what happened is she' s madame bovary .
she' s married to a park avenue doctor and that' s too dull for her .
then there' s tom , the money market maven , and perry , the travel agent guy .
but , no , she wants more .
more ?
more what ?
i' m sure she doesn' t know .
more fantasies .
her youth back .
she wants to " fulfill her life before it' s too late .
those are her words .
why is she coming here ?
she has no money .
she has nowhere else to go .
amanda , we have no room .
there' s no room here .
i figured we' il put a bed in the office .
in the office , amanda ?
that' s where i write .
that' s where i create .
my whole world is in there .
you can create in the living room .
in the ... ?
no , amanda .
everything is in there , okay ?
that' s my space .
it' s where i write .
all of my rituals revolve around my space .
i can' t ...
she' s my mother .
she' s not staying in a shelter .
why didn' t you tell me earlier ?
i didn' t want to ruin your dinner .
my anniversary tuna fish sandwich ?
you' re making matters worse , okay ?
you' re giving me a migraine .
hello .
i' il only be a minute .
when i left you , i ran into danny wax .
he said the baby sitter routine you wrote for him is not working .
there are no laughs .
not one laugh in that routine .
people are sitting with stone faces .
the routine is fine .
the guy' s just in the wrong profession .
that' s what i told him .
i said , " danny , you' ve been around for a long time .
you think there' s a reason you never made it ?
no tact .
none .
none .
i said to him , " danny , a man buys a suit .
he says he' s happy with it .
then he sees another suit .
suddenly he doesn' t want the suit he' s got !
he wants a new suit .
he' s not happy with the old one .
right , yeah .
listen , i' m a little busy now .
can i ring you back ?
i was up to nbc .
there is nothing doing up there .
not right now .
things being equal , they' il change .
right now they' re not equal .
i' d like to have lunch with you this week .
i need a business thing done .
we have to talk .
i got a business thing to discuss .
what kind of business ?
what do you mean ?
there' s nothing to get anxious about .
it' s about the future .
good bye .
jerry , do you think i' m fat ?
i think you' re amazing looking .
you' re just used to the losers you dated before me .
losers ?
not all of them were losers .
what is behind your back ?
something for me ?
this is for you .
happy anniversary .
happy anniversary .
you have to forgive the wrapping .
i lost my temper when i couldn' t get it even .
i can tell .
not exactly a work of art , but i forgive you .
open , open .
i think i know what these are .
do you ?
these are the earrings from downtown !
i couldn' t not get them for you .
you look so good in those kind of earrings .
do l ?
beautiful .
absolutely beautiful .
thank you .
you like them ?
you' re the only one i' ve ever dated who' s known exactly what to get me .
it' s because you have a special vision of me .
no exit " and " the flies .
jean paul sartre .
that' s amazing .
thank you .
it was between that and o' neill .
i couldn' t decide whose nihilistic pessimism made you happier .
i think it was tennessee williams who said that the opposite of death is desire .
and i desired you from the first moment we met .
i could live down here .
it' s so beautiful .
it is .
it' s very pretty .
i don' t know about living down here .
i like to visit , but i like to go home to the upper east side .
you wouldn' t consider it ?
after we get married , move to the village .
why is marriage so important ?
i just got out of a marriage .
just because we get a signed piece of paper ?
you moved in with me .
we' re a couple , right ?
yes , we moved in together .
we' ve been dating over a year now .
i guess i' m old fashioned .
i know .
all your girlfriends are getting married ...
falk , what' s up ?
bob , how are you ?
bob , this is brooke .
brooke , bob stiles .
how' s it going ?
falk and brooke .
this is amanda .
this is falk .
this is brooke .
so , what are you guys doing down here ?
she just bought her dad a ridiculous birthday present .
you think it' s ridiculous .
i think it' s great .
let them see it .
maybe i' m wrong .
oh , that' s a ...
a turn of the century stereopticon .
you knew that .
wait .
it' s complete with pornographic slides .
lsn' t it wonderful ?
i think it' s brilliant .
just what he needs , antique pornography .
i always thought you had a little yen for your dad .
ha ha .
hey !
we' re going to a great lndian restaurant tomorrow night .
we want to invite you .
i' ve hyped you to amanda .
you can only disappoint .
that sounds great .
are we busy tomorrow night ?
we' re taking my parents out .
but that was tentative , i thought .
you hate lndian food .
" hate . " that' s a strong word .
i' ve wanted to give it a second chance since i realized how much you ... she loves tandoori chicken .
come on .
it' il be fun .
i should give it another shot .
what i love about bogart is that he' s so intensely urban .
the cigarette , the five o' clock shadow .
always in some seedy nightclub .
didn' t i say that exact same thing about frank sinatra ?
urban .
exactly .
i even used the term .
that' s ...
where did you go to school ?
ethical culture .
fieldston .
brandeis .
but i dropped out .
one of her professors fell in love with her .
it was terrible .
he was married .
it was way too much pressure for all of us .
his poor wife !
in addition to acting , she' s a very good singer .
i try to sing , but then i hear someone like billie holiday , and forget about it !
she' s your favorite !
but you can' t listen to the cd' s , right ?
they sterilize the sound .
didn' t i say that ?
i absolutely agree with you .
it totally sterilizes ... that' s so funny .
actually , someone told me about this seedy record store that has all of her old recordings on 78s and 33s .
i' d love to know about it .
she is amazing .
it' s early .
let' s go to the village vanguard .
diana krall is playing .
it should be a great show .
i' il get so discouraged , but i am dying to see her .
great .
you get up so early to write .
yeah , but i did most of my stuff for tomorrow , so ...
should we ?
what do you ...
yeah , sure .
# hide your heart from sight
# lock your dreams at night
# it could happen to you
# don' t count stars or you might stumble
# someone drops a sigh
# and down you tumble
# keep an eye on spring
# run when church bells ring
# it could happen to you
she' s so moving .
i agree .
she' s totally moving .
absolutely .
you' ve captured her .
what was i saying ?
i' d love to take one of those boats down the amazon .
it' s supposed to be so beautiful .
not tonight ?
of course not tonight .
i was ... that' s funny .
but how thrilling that would be .
that would be so thrilling .
you hate heat .
you hate mosquitoes .
i hate malaria .
it' s malaria , remember ?
i don' t hate all mosquitoes .
i want to see the parrots and the giant butterflies .
i' ve seen pictures in national geographic .
they' re gorgeous !
giant , huge ...
and wild monkeys would be ...
monkeys ?
how much have you had to drink ?
do you like snakes ?
do i like snakes ?
some people get queasy around them , but i think they' re beautiful .
the way they move ... it' s so sensual .
so sen ...
i love snakes .
cobras , for example .
pythons .
naturally .
pythons .
garters .
rattlesnakes .
i love them all .
i cannot believe i' m hearing this .
oh , please .
i' ve often said , often , that there' s nothing like a dense jungle in the rain .
i' ve said this .
you' re drunk .
that' s not true .
speaking of rain , there' s supposed to be a hurricane tonight .
we should rent a car and drive to the hamptons .
we could walk on the beach ...
he hates the hamptons .
nobody hates the ocean .
she' s up for anything .
it' s too late for me .
i can' t .
don' t you have an audition tomorrow ?
my candle burns at both ends , it will not last the night .
millay !
edna millay !
she' s my favorite poet !
don' t i quote her all the time ?
edna millay ...
amanda' s pretty , isn' t she ?
she' s okay , i suppose .
you' re drunk .
i was looking at her face in the candlelight and she has this offbeat sexual quality .
yeah , i guess .
if , uh , you know , if you find that crippling sense of passionate heat behind those big eyes sexy .
huh ?
hmm ?
nothing .
bob' s crazy about her .
i got the whole story while you were in the men' s room throwing up .
i' m fine .
believe me , i' m okay .
she moved in with him and i get the feeling he is dying to marry her .
oh , yeah ?
they make a nice couple .
he' s charming and very attractive .
are you okay ?
yeah .
amanda ?
hey , it' s jerry falk .
good , good .
you ?
listen , i was just about to go to this old record store i found out about .
i know you were interested in picking up some billie holiday .
i' m actually vaguely near your house , so i thought that , um ...
i mean , if you and bob are busy ...
right .
of course .
he would be at work .
what was i thinking ?
i could be there pretty soon .
maybe , say , three minutes ?
great .
i' il meet you in front of your place .
bye .
these are great .
let me get you this diana krall record as a present since i know how big of a fan you are .
wasn' t she great the other night ?
so great .
i love that you appreciate old songs .
they' re so pretty .
i' d love to hear you sing sometime .
i can' t sing publicly .
i' m too fat .
fat ?
i' m sorry .
did you say fat ?
but i have these great diet pills .
they take away your appetite , but increase your sexual drive .
is that how you met bob ?
from his record company ?
no .
he picked me up in central park , actually .
oh , how funny .
and you guys got ... seriously involved ?
no .
he' d like to , but ...
i can' t commit .
i have a problem with commitment .
i dream of meeting someone who i' il want to give myself over to , where i' d be the one hurt in the end .
but it hasn' t happened yet .
you ?
me neither .
um , unfortunately , same here .
brooke and i are in the last stages , basically .
really ?
oh , yeah .
she didn' t give me that impression .
she didn' t ?
well , that' s strange , because that' s the only impression to give , really .
oh !
look at this , uh , record .
cole porter .
this is a fantas ... really pretty songs on here .
let me get you this as a little present .
can i do that ?
i was actually listening to this last night , and i thought of you .
you were listening to cole porter and thought of me ?
you must really have a crush on me .
i do ?
i' d say it' s fatal .
i' m sorry .
i , uh ...
i couldn' t resist .
don' t apologize .
i wanted you to .
you did ?
yes .
i' ve had a crush on you since we met .
couldn' t you tell , the way i was ignoring you ?
well , there was something compelling about your apathy .
i thought you were sweet and sensitive and vulnerable .
and i could tell you liked me , too .
i can' t believe i' m in love with a smoker .
i don' t want anyone to get hurt .
where were you ?
it' s 1 0 : 00 .
where ?
well , um , i had a meeting to go to .
you smell from alcohol .
i do ?
my god , your tongue is black !
it is ?
well , um ... that' s because i had some wine .
wine ?
why ?
it' s not passover .
no .
uh , to celebrate .
uh , the deal .
what deal ?
i have to tell you , um , it looks like i have a great opportunity to work for , for , um , a very , very funny , uh , puppet .
it' s , uh ... remember i ...
is this a woman' s hair ?
is this ... is this a woman' s hair ?
i mean , it could be ...
i suppose .
possibly from , uh , the taxi .
it was ...
i mean , i think , you know , all the people in and out ,
i probably sat up in ...
i guess , the woman' s hair .
i am exhausted .
she asked me if i still love her .
what could i say ?
why can' t i tell her the truth ?
i' m in love with amanda .
why can' t i tell her it' s over ?
why can' t i leave people ?
tell me about your dream .
the cleveland lndians got jobs at toys r us ?
yeah .
so what can it possibly mean ?
look , i can' t keep wasting my hour here describing lunatic dreams .
i have a date with amanda .
i can' t keep running around town on the sly and live like this .
amanda can handle it , but i need help .
what do i do ?
i have to extricate myself from brooke .
it' il break her heart .
she wants to marry me !
the guy will not talk .
i' ve been with him for three years .
what comes to mind about the cleveland lndians ?
see ?
this is what i get .
i need a course of action , and he wants me to free associate about the cleveland lndians .
i love doing it in hotels .
it' s so illicit .
check yourself for shoulder length hairs in hard to justify locations .
i have to decide how to let brooke down gracefully .
there' s no rush .
i' ve been the other woman before .
bob wasn' t upset when you told him ?
he was disappointed .
but i was honest about myself going in .
naturally , i didn' t tell him it was you i was in love with .
brooke ...
don' t give me that !
i don' t believe you !
those are bite marks on your back .
you didn' t fall on your comb !
what are you thinking about ?
everything .
when we first met , when brooke found out .
remember that ?
or when we checked into that hotel as s. and z. fitzgerald .
or how we made love everywhere .
god , everywhere .
when i think of all the risky places that lust overcame the two of us , it blows my mind .
you know fireside memorial chapel is a mcdonald' s now ?
fascinating .
don' t .
why not ?
i can' t .
what do you mean ?
it' s not natural .
we never sleep with each other .
i told you i' m going through a rough patch .
i' il say .
it' s been six months !
i said you could sleep with other women .
i don' t love other women .
i don' t want to sleep with other women .
i love you .
what did i do to turn you off ?
i don' t get it .
nothing .
you did nothing .
it' s always about you .
you have such an ego .
an ego ?
what do you want me to do ?
grit my teeth , close my eyes , hold myself stiff and let you do it to me ?
it' s getting to the point where i may settle for that .
sometimes i think it' s because you remind me of my father .
you once told me you thought your father was sexually attractive .
that' s not the part of him you remind me of .
it' s not ?
what is it , then ?
you know , his professional manner .
sweet and supportive .
gee , i' m sorry i have so many turn off qualities .
i didn' t realize .
sleep with other women .
just don' t tell me about it .
do you love me ?
what a question !
just because i pull away when you touch me ?
just because i pull away when you touch me ?
falk , give me a break .
she said it was temporary .
meanwhile , you haven' t consummated your passion for her in six months !
it' s unbelievable !
i have a theory that too much rejection causes cancer .
she encourages me to sleep with other women .
well , do it !
for god' s sakes !
there must be a million women who' d be excited to get into bed with you .
maybe not a million , but i' m sure you could find one , if you got her drunk enough .
it doesn' t matter .
i have no interest in other women .
see , even my first wife was ...
wife ?
you were married ?
a bitter story .
i was very young .
i should have known something was wrong on the wedding night when her family danced around my table chanting , " we will make him one of us !
oh , boy !
i had a rough day .
i got up , put on a shirt and the button came off .
then i went to the car to open the door , and the handle came off .
now i' m afraid to go to the bathroom .
what did you do ?
i wanted to grab the check .
no , you didn' t .
what do you mean ?
i did .
i was grabbing the check .
never trust a guy who fumbles for the check .
he who wants to get the check , gets it .
as you go through life , when you really want to get the check , you will .
well , i was planning on getting it .
let me ask you ...
did you hear what that guy said ?
three people were coming in as we were leaving .
the swarthy guy ?
yeah .
dark .
there were two guys and a girl .
i didn' t hear him .
jews start all wars .
did you hear that ?
no !
yes , absolutely .
he presumably said it to her or the guy with them , but it was really for our benefit .
jews start all wars .
i don' t think it was for my benefit because i didn' t hear anything .
i know who you' re talking about .
i saw this trio , but i didn' t hear anything and i have pretty good hearing .
because you were obsessed with the physically prepossessing waitresses running around .
let me tell you , falk .
we live in perilous times .
you got to keep alert for these things .
you don' t want your life to wind up as black and white newsreel footage scored by a cello in a minor key .
hey .
hi .
how are you ?
good .
how was the comedian ?
it' s exactly like dobel says .
there is truly a paucity of veridical talent in the world .
when will i meet this polymath ?
he is unbelievable .
he' s read everything .
he plays music .
he paints , or so he claims .
i' ve read some of his poems ... all morbid !
cancer and shock treatments and gas chambers .
and his vocabulary is astounding .
you can' t get the guy on a word .
it' s rare you' re so taken with somebody .
hey , mrs. chase .
i told you not to call me mrs. chase !
my name is paula !
mrs. chase makes me sound ancient .
my life isn' t over yet .
in fact , i' m just starting to live it .
definitely , paula .
and i need some help from you .
mom , could you talk about this tomorrow ?
it' s late .
what , are we six years old ?
it' s past our bedtime ?
it' s okay .
it' s only 1 : 30 .
i decided to put some songs together and do a nightclub act .
mother , the scene has really changed in the past 25 years .
why are you so discouraging ?
i' m not .
i' m realistic .
i don' t want you to get hurt .
how ?
i could always sing .
of course you can sing .
i' m not saying that .
but things change .
styles , the cabaret business ...
can' t you be more supportive ?
you' re so competitive !
i am not !
i hate my voice !
please .
you both have very good voices .
i thought i' d put a few songs together and you could write between the songs talk for me .
i' ve never done that sort of thing .
just some banter .
not jokes .
i couldn' t tell a joke if my life depended on it .
just some chit chat .
the truth is , i' m kind of snowed under right now ...
oh , god !
is nobody on my side ?
jerry , you could do it .
this stuff comes so easily to you .
you just said this is a fool' s errand .
what did you call me ?
it' s an expression .
i know .
i tried to dissuade her , but she won' t listen to me .
i' m trying to finish my book .
these comics are pressing me .
i' ve taken deposits from them .
oh , forget i even asked .
okay .
i never said i wouldn' t do it .
i just have to fit it in .
it won' t be arduous !
i have lots of ideas !
i' m even having a piano delivered !
here ?
it' s a rental .
i had to rehearse !
there' s no room for a piano .
because you don' t maximize your space !
i was an interior decorator .
tell him , amanda .
i know this is a real pain , but it' s temporary .
you mean like our lovemaking ?
could you not be gross ?
as the days passed , dobel and i got closer and closer .
after he finished school , we' d meet in central park .
he' d usually expound on something .
you think quantum physics has the answer ?
i mean , what purpose does it serve for me that time and space are exactly the same thing ?
i ask a guy what time it is , he tells me six miles ?
what the hell is that ?
falk , if a guy comes out onstage at carnegie hall and throws up , you can always find some people who will call it art .
years ago , a very wonderful comedy writer wrote a very funny book with a really deep and meaningful title .
it was called " never trust a naked bus driver .
you would be amazed how many people do exactly that , and worse .
do you masturbate , falk ?
what ?
i mean , given the circumstances of your sex life , i would think ...
this is not ... stop squirming .
i' m not .
i don' t know .
now and then , i guess .
when is now and then ?
on easter and purim ?
i don' t really enjoy it .
are you doing it right ?
does your hand fall asleep ?
i happen to think it' s a poor substitute for the real thing .
really ?
i prefer it to the real thing .
last night , i was home by myself and i conjured up a threesome with me , marilyn monroe and sophia loren .
it was very erotic .
in fact , if i' m not mistaken , it was the first time those two great actresses ever appeared in anything together .
it sounds nice , but ...
the only reason i ask is because i think that as you go through life , you learn to depend only on yourself .
you know ?
do you own a firearm ?
a gun ?
a gun qualifies as a firearm , yes .
no .
why would l ?
for self defense .
against who ?
against those who conspire to harm you .
harm me ?
don' t ask what you did to deserve it .
i mean , god , read auden .
you know , come with me to new jersey .
falk , i took the liberty a few weeks ago of ordering you a little present .
what ?
they' re having a sale here on surplus russian army rifles .
what ?
suppose you' re home one night in bed , masturbating , and some guys break in .
you need protection .
i' d dial 91 1 .
i don' t need a rifle .
have you ever dialed 91 1 ?
it' s like trying to get a mortgage .
come on .
i don' t need a rifle .
i' il probably wind up blowing my foot off .
what is wrong with you ?
are you such a maladroit you can' t keep a firearm without discharging it adventitiously ?
i don' t need a weapon .
everybody needs a weapon .
what does that mean ?
it means the day will come when you wish you had one .
why exactly ?
why ?
so they don' t put you in a boxcar .
i want to get you some of this stuff , too .
what for ?
so you can build a survival kit .
i have a perfect survival kit .
i' ve been working on it for years .
last week i got some great fishhooks , and a waterproof matchbox that floats .
what are you preparing for , the end of civilization ?
i have to know if i' m alone in the wilds , i can survive by myself .
dobel , you' re a madman .
that' s what they said in germany .
there were actually groups in germany called " jews for hitler .
they were deluded .
they thought he' d be good for the country .
never trust a naked bus driver .
by the time i got out of bed and loaded it ,
the damage would be done .
that' s why you keep it loaded .
i should keep a loaded gun in the house ?
why would you keep an unloaded weapon in the house ?
do you keep a loaded gun in the house ?
i have a loaded weapon in my house within reach .
within reach , falk .
in every room .
just how crazy are you ?
is there more ?
do you hear voices on the radio or worship snakes ?
you are a member of one of the most persecuted minorities in history .
the rifle' s on me .
let me handle this .
this makes me nervous .
i' ve never owned a weapon .
you have to learn to take it apart and put it together blindfolded .
you may have to do it in the dark .
you expecting nazis and a blackout ?
incidentally , while you were rummaging around the store in an aimless stupor ,
i got you a couple of items .
i got you a flashlight that floats if you drop it in the ocean for any reason .
when the hell am i near the ocean ?
i want you to build a survival kit .
i got you a compass , a ...
i live in manhattan .
why would i need a compass ?
this flare gun .
i got you some snakebite stuff , fishhooks , water purifying tablets .
this all sounds a little excessive to me .
and don' t pull the trigger .
squeeze it .
squeeze the trigger .
that' s right .
just take aim and squeeze ... [ gun clicking ]
sorry !
sorry , sorry !
it' s empty .
dobel was showing me how to use a rifle .
we were practicing .
why ?
why ?
well , it' s for protection .
from who ?
what do you mean , from who ?
dobel , tell her .
i' m dobel .
hi .
who do you need protection from ?
burglars , rapists , the gestapo .
it was my idea that , given the tensions in the world , perhaps it would be prudent for young falk to own a means of self defense .
have you had a mental breakdown ?
you and a rifle ?
i know it seems weird .
what' s this stuff ?
this is all very important .
these are water purifying tablets and that' s a flashlight that floats .
let' s say you drop it in the ocean .
it floats .
are you joining the boy scouts ?
it' s all very necessary .
are these bullets ?
they' re called rounds .
right ?
jump in here at any point .
falk , i don' t mean to incite domestic strife here .
amanda , it' s all very safe .
see what happens ... what i do is take a pliers and i remove the lead part from the shell .
you see ?
then i have the empty ... empty shell .
okay ?
and what i do is i put this now in the breech in the rifle , okay ?
so then if a shot' s taken , it won' t really fire .
not until the second round goes into the breech .
the chamber !
the chamber , falk !
into the chamber .
i am not living in the house with a loaded rifle .
you don' t trust me to keep a firearm without hurting anyone ?
am i an imbecile ?
is that a trick question ?
dobel , would you say something ?
it' s his feeling that as the economy slumps , crime rises , okay ?
and rape ... rape has risen .
statistically speaking , rape has gone up .
and he' s not convinced that the slaughter of six million jews is enough to satisfy the anti semitic impulses of the majority of the world .
you said this .
he' s paraphrasing .
i put it more succinctly when i ... [ door closing ]
oh !
don' t worry , mother .
it' s not loaded .
what' s happening ?
i bought a rifle .
a rifle ? !
i' m not living in a house with a rifle !
don' t worry , mom .
it' s leaving .
no , it' s not .
it' s not leaving .
perhaps we should rethink the concept of self defense .
mrs. chase , is it unreasonable to own a fire extinguisher , though you' il probably never use it ?
stop calling me mrs. chase !
my name is paula !
i' m not your goddamn schoolteacher !
falk , urgent business in tierra del fuego requires my presence , so i' il be leaving .
sir , would you mind helping me shift this piano ?
me ?
mother , he' s a guest .
would you take these when you go ?
i don' t care who he is .
this room isn' t right .
that' s because it' s too crowded .
meaning what ?
you want me on a park bench ?
don' t be so dramatic .
all i want out is this stupid rifle .
are you going to help me ?
i live to serve .
make your wishes known .
pivot .
pivot .
hello .
did i get you at a bad time ?
i just want to set the date for the end of the week for lunch .
how' s friday ?
friday .
hold on one second , harvey .
i have steamers in the fridge from a week ago sunday .
you hungry ?
no .
i make it a practice never to ingest bivalves that have been dead more than 72 hours .
christ , i need a drink .
this room just isn' t right .
what are these ?
water purifying tablets .
what for ?
is the plumbing backed up ?
thursday' s better .
what do you want to talk about ?
the who , the what and the wherefore .
thursday , lsabella' s , at noon .
right .
bye .
no , you' re doing it .
just pivot it .
what' s happening here ?
i have it under control .
nothing that can' t be done with 1 2 stevedores and some oxen .
paula , where do you want this ?
against the wall .
i' il help you do it .
sir , would you take this ?
mom , here you go .
jesus , what a butterfingers !
watch your hands when you pick these up .
these things happen .
this can be glued .
i don' t understand why those people could leave the room after the dinner party and go home .
what' d you think ?
it was great .
yeah , i agree .
listen , i' m sorry about my mother .
i know she' s been out of control .
don' t worry about it .
she is a little tough , but nevertheless , i will gladly help her with her singing act .
you are a sweetheart .
i don' t know what i' d do without you .
i' ve got a great idea .
instead of going home , let' s check into a hotel .
let' s check into a hotel !
maybe away from everything in a completely different atmosphere , you' il be more relaxed .
we used to check into hotels all the time .
it was exciting and fun .
but it was different then .
but it won' t be different .
it' il be just like we used to .
come on , it' il be great .
hi .
how are you ?
we' re interested in a single room .
how much is that ?
a single room is $200 a night . $200 .
wow .
it' s amazing how even the cheapest ones have gone up .
let' s not get a single .
it' s so sleazy .
we' re trying to be romantic .
you' re right .
um , do you have a small suite ?
a small suite ?
very small .
let me check .
i' il be right back .
wow !
look at this place .
it' s nice .
thank you .
have a good one .
how much did you give him ?
three bucks .
not five ?
five ?
he just turned the light on .
we have no luggage .
should i have given him five ?
it doesn' t matter .
i' m sorry .
i' m just tense .
this is fun , isn' t it ?
it' s kind of sexy , being back in a hotel .
should we order caviar ?
caviar ?
you just had all that popcorn at the movie .
plus the peppermints and the ice cream sandwich .
i know .
i' m definitely going on a diet tomorrow .
i can' t believe how much they charge for a suite .
it' s not what i expected .
is that what you' re thinking about ?
no .
no , i' m thinking of you and how sexy you are .
i need another .
come here .
what' s wrong ?
it' s too bright .
too bright ?
okay , well , i can fix that , i guess .
is that better ?
no , it' s still too bright .
really ?
yes !
you know how hard this is for me .
maybe it' s because of this room .
i' il shut these off .
there .
is that better ?
no .
turn that off .
you used to like making love with the lights on .
or in a sunny room in front of mirrors .
remember ?
can we start with the lights off ?
okay .
not a problem .
there we go .
how' s that ?
thank you .
come here .
you know how sexy you are ?
here ...
iet' s take off your sweatshirt .
i' il take my pants off here .
christ !
i' m sorry .
i had all this change from the movie house when i bought your popcorn .
i can' t do this .
the moment' s ruined .
that' s crazy .
it shouldn' t be that delicate .
it' s not about should !
look , i' m a wreck !
okay , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , but i can' t .
i can' t do this .
we' il start again , okay ?
it' il be fine .
a clean slate , okay ?
we got this room .
let' s take advantage .
we' il just start over , okay ?
come here .
see ?
it' s nothing we haven' t done before , right ?
jerry ?
jerry , i can' t breathe .
what do you mean ?
i can' t ...
what do you mean ?
i can' t breathe .
my throat' s swelling .
your throat' s not swelling .
it is .
this has happened before .
why don' t you sit down ?
amanda , sit down for a second .
you want me to get you some water ?
no .
i feel nauseous .
you' re not nauseous .
i am .
just , just take it easy .
amanda , do you want me to open the window ?
maybe you need some fresh air .
you' re getting pale .
are you serious ?
i need a doctor .
you don' t need a doctor .
just lay down for a second .
i' m really dizzy .
all right .
just , um , hold on .
just , um , breathe through your nose , okay ?
come on .
come on .
here .
leave a tip for the maid .
so , if i push on your chest here , do you feel any pain ?
well , it' s right under the breast i get a shooting pain .
your left breast ?
yes .
have you ever had a reaction like this before ?
yes .
do you have any allergies ?
i hope not .
i' m just checking your glands right now .
you take all these pills ?
yes .
they' re different diets .
then i have my antidepressants and my sleeping pills .
but they have opposite effects .
i don' t take them all on the same day .
you had a few vodkas , you say ?
breathe in .
hold .
let it go .
why do you use diet pills ?
i have some trouble with my weight .
you' re not overweight .
you have a lovely figure .
lean back .
this doesn' t hurt , does it ?
no .
you' re a very beautiful young woman .
thank you .
yeah , breathe .
good .
the doctor had better sex examining her than i' ve had in 6 months !
she has this wayward appeal .
men go instantly crazy for her !
what do i do ?
i' m trapped in a situation here .
what do i do ?
say something .
our time is up .
suppose we continue at our next meeting .
mr. falk , i would like to say that
i will stop treating you if you insist on keeping that rifle .
what ?
why ?
i think it' s an acting out .
and it' s more to your advantage to talk about it than act out .
but dobel thinks in the end , we can only count on ourselves .
i' m afraid our time is up .
if you don' t get rid of the rifle , i can' t continue the analysis .
jerry !
hey , bill .
how are you ?
i' m good .
so , what are you doing here ?
i' m having lunch with my manager , inside .
that harry wexler clown ?
i saw him go in .
harvey .
yeah , yeah .
nobody understands why you don' t lose him .
lose harvey ?
the guy is a joke in the business .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
i' m telling you this as a friend .
you' re starting to happen a little bit .
you don' t need a character like this representing you .
thanks .
i' il certainly think about it .
how' s your girlfriend ?
amanda ?
she' s good .
she' s studying acting and singing .
promise me one thing .
you guys ever break up , you give me her number .
just kidding .
except i' m deadly serious .
we' re not breaking up .
good to see you .
story of my life .
bye , jerry !
sorry i' m late .
i thought i' d be late .
my mom had a gallbladder attack .
so , you want to discuss ... ?
no big deal .
i' il get it out of the way then we can eat and enjoy the meal .
a coffee , please .
i' m fine .
now ... our original contract was for three years .
it' s almost up .
it' s up in a few months .
my game plan for you is going perfectly .
a lot of people laughed at me when i said i only wanted one client .
and a kid , too !
it' s like a clothing store that specializes in quality rather than quantity .
all the other managers in town , even my own family predicted that you would dump me if you made it big on my efforts .
i said , " you do not know jerry falk .
jerry falk and i have a special relationship .
it goes way beyond the contract .
we are very close .
i was at his wedding .
i bought him a toaster .
we are this close .
i' ve done things for him
you couldn' t even write into a contract .
what' s this ?
our new agreement .
you don' t have to read it now .
take it home and read it .
it' s not that complicated .
it' s the same thing , except it' s for seven years instead of three .
i figured , why burden you with signing a contract every three years ?
especially since we' re gonna be together for a long , long time !
you can' t sign that , falk .
what are you , a cretin ?
i can' t not sign it .
the guy' s whole life is invested in me .
the guy' s an idiot !
he' s in the wrong business .
he should be pushing a rack on seventh avenue .
he put in the tough work when no one else cared .
he' s not a bad guy , he' s just ...
i can' t figure you out .
you' ve been with a shrink for years , yet you' re too guilty to say good bye to the inept homunculus that poses as your manager .
incidentally , my shrink says i have to get rid of the rifle .
what ?
he says it' s an acting out .
what kind of charlatan would want you unarmed in this world ?
he' s not a charlatan .
they' re all charlatans , falk !
you know , since the beginning of time , people have been frightened and unhappy and scared to death and scared of getting old and there have always been priests and shamans and now shrinks to tell them " i know you' re frightened , but i can help you .
of course , it' il cost you a few bucks .
but they can' t help you , because life is what it is .
hey , what did you think of amanda ?
i know you only met her for , like , 1 5 minutes under pretty chaotic circumstances but she has a great quality , doesn' t she ?
she' s cheating on you , you know .
what are you talking about ?
she' s cheating on you !
how do you know ?
' cause i know .
how do you know ?
you see her with someone ?
no .
did she say something to you ?
no .
then why would you say she' s cheating on me ?
i can tell by her eyes .
her eyes ?
her eyes .
yes , her eyes .
dobel , you have a certain brilliance .
you do .
you' re a sweet guy and a wonderful writer of humor , but you are a deeply , deeply deranged human being .
falk , i' m telling you , she' s cheating on you , and you' re too typhlotic to see it .
typhlosis , falk .
blindness .
is she cheating on me ?
dobel has poisoned the well .
how the hell would he know ?
is he some kind of visionary ?
not at all .
he' s a simple , garden variety paranoid .
jews start all wars .
a gun in every room of his apartment !
amanda' s cheating on me because he sees it in her eyes ?
bull !
and yet ...
jerry ?
this is connie .
connie , jerry .
nice to meet you .
connie is a brilliant actress .
amanda' s the actress !
ray !
come with me .
i have to talk to you .
amanda tells me you' re a writer .
what are you working on ?
a novel .
about what ?
the absolute terror of confronting one' s death .
i just finished " notes from underground .
isn' t dostoyevsky the most amazing , poignant , talented writer ?
who cares about dostoyevsky if amanda' s sleeping with that guy ?
she always talks about ray polito .
such a hotshot new actor .
animal instincts .
this generation' s brando .
they certainly make eye contact .
she' s so sexy .
look at her body language .
all verbs !
have i ... ?
read " house of the dead .
oh , yes .
yes , i have .
i found it surprisingly neoteric .
modern .
very modern .
yes , modern .
would you excuse me just a second ?
yeah , sure .
jerry , hi .
you remember ray polito ?
nice to see you .
how are you ?
good .
you ?
i was telling ray about how you have a real interest in old theater posters .
he says he has a great source .
my buddy , jay binns , has some really rare ones .
he' d be happy to show them to you anytime .
thanks .
yeah , maybe sometime , sure .
we could rent a car and drive out tonight .
tonight ?
connie ?
you should come , too .
you should bring doug .
who' s doug ?
go where ?
my buddy lives in montauk .
we' re going there tonight .
at this hour , there' s no traffic .
montauk ?
it' s midnight .
montauk at midnight ?
what could be more romantic ?
i can' t .
me either .
it' s just too late .
i have to get up early .
you know i work best in the morning .
but we' il walk on the beach , maybe take a swim .
ray' il play his guitar .
you play guitar ?
yeah .
i' d rather eat rat poison than watch this guy play guitar on the beach at 3 am .
you' re so quiet .
so are you .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
don' t say , " nothing .
obviously , you' re upset .
are you crushed because we didn' t drive 1 00 miles to look at theater posters and hear this guy play his guitar ?
shhh !
my mother' s sleeping .
that road company james dean looked at you
iike you were a freshly baked cannoli .
are you in love with connie ?
connie ?
don' t pretend you can' t remember her name .
i wouldn' t have even looked at connie if you hadn' t thrown us together .
i thought you' d like her .
she' s smart and beautiful and very literate .
a literate actress ?
what , is that like a four leaf clover ?
most men find her seductive .
if you wanted to go off with ray polito , you should have gone .
you didn' t need to fix me up with someone .
please !
i thought you' d want to see his friend' s theater posters .
i have no interest in connie .
none .
nada .
you can sleep with other women .
just don' t throw it in my face .
i' m not sleeping with her !
do you want to sleep with ray ?
jesus christ !
will you two keep it down ?
i can' t sleep .
you got any pills ?
i' m sorry , mother .
i can' t have these late night discussions .
i need a sleeping pill .
jerry ?
come here .
i want to show you something .
now ?
it' s 2 am .
come here !
jerry .
this goddamn ballad is driving me crazy .
just tell me what you think .
# don' t cry
# there' il be another spring
# i know our hearts
# will dance again
# and sing again
# so wait for me
# till then
# be glad
# the bird is on the wing
# another chance to love
# and laugh with me
# just wait and see
# i love you now
# and i' il love you forever
# oh , don' t
# be sad
# we' il surely be
# together
# for the sky
# is bluer overhead
# if you will just
# believe in me
# there' il be
# another
# spring
if life is meaningless , then why choose to live ?
dobel says we don' t choose , our blood chooses for us .
what does it all add up to if i die ?
freud says sex and work .
dobel says work gives the illusion of meaning , and sex gives the illusion of continuity .
she' s going to practice now ?
hey , paula ?
i' m trying to clarify some ideas for my novel .
i just need ...
i have some ideas for dialogue leading to the judy garland medley .
could we talk about it later ?
i am so nervous .
i don' t know why i' m so scared of performing .
where does amanda keep her valium ?
there .
i' il get you one .
i just need a little bit of quiet , just for the morning .
okay , paula ?
i went to the bathroom to get her mother a valium .
because dobel made me so damn suspicious ,
i couldn' t resist the impulse to open her diaphragm case to see if it was there , and it wasn' t .
why does she need her diaphragm ?
what for ?
and what' s wrong with me ?
why should the thought of amanda sleeping with someone be both excruciating and exciting ?
i feel like committing suicide , but i have so many problems , that wouldn' t solve them all .
what should i do ?
what would you do ?
huh ?
what do i do ?
if it was me , falk , i would follow her .
why do you put these paranoid thoughts in my head ?
why does she wear a diaphragm ?
why isn' t she on the pill ?
it' s hormonal .
the pill makes her crazy .
the pill makes her crazy ?
falk , she is crazy !
the pentagon should use her hormones for chemical warfare !
i don' t get it .
where is it ?
where is her diaphragm ?
well , you know , i can imagine .
i' ve never followed anyone .
it' s not rocket science , falk .
the trick is not to be seen .
where is she now ?
acting class .
you think .
christ , don' t say that .
of course she' s at acting class .
she wouldn' t miss that .
it' s too crucial .
and that' s where she sees her acting partner , ray polito .
look , i' m not good at following .
why don' t you come with me ?
i can' t .
i promised students i' d take them to the caravaggio exhibit at the metropolitan museum .
i give them a little culture now and then so they don' t beat each other to death with bicycle chains .
i' m too nervous to follow her .
there' s nothing to it , you know .
you' re worried about what you' re going to find , that' s all .
you are a writer .
you have a gift .
you should have a girlfriend who helps you and is encouraging , not some mercurial little jitterbug who' il have you hold up filling stations
to keep her in mood elevators .
i shouldn' t have looked .
what you don' t know will kill you !
what you don' t know won' t hurt you , it' il kill you .
like if they tell you you' re going to showers but they turn out not to be showers .
ray polito .
i knew it .
where were you ?
we have theater tickets tonight .
paula , could you excuse us ?
i have to talk to amanda .
my god , jerry .
has the president been shot ?
fine with me .
i have a date tonight .
what ?
you have a date ?
with who ?
i must confess .
it' s with a guy who picked me up .
where ?
at my aa meeting .
great .
an alcoholic .
he' s not an alcoholic .
he' s the alcoholic' s friend , the enabler .
even better .
what does he do ?
he' s a horse whisperer .
what are you talking about ?
what are you looking for , your keys ?
yes .
they' re over here .
he' s 26 years old .
fabulous .
you' re going out with a 26 year old horse whisperer .
amanda , could i talk to you ?
hold on !
would you really care if i got a tattoo ?
yes .
we' il discuss it later .
no , mom .
we' il discuss it .
mom , don' t .
mom , your keys .
your keys .
thanks .
jesus , you' re so crazy !
where were you today ?
acting class .
no , i mean after .
at a girlfriend' s apartment , rehearsing a scene .
no .
no , you weren' t because i know you were in the school building with your teacher .
that' s right .
i saw you .
how ?
i was spying on you .
spying ?
that' s right .
i saw the three of you .
you , your acting teacher and your diaphragm .
your diaphragm .
it' s not here , so where could it be ?
there' s no such thing as a diaphragm repair shop .
i was there , amanda .
i saw it all .
okay .
okay , i slept with ron keller .
but i didn' t do it because i care about him .
no ?
what then ?
to punish him ?
i had to find out if something was wrong with me .
i can' t sleep with you , the person that i love .
i had to know if i was some kind of freak , or frigid .
i had to know if i could even get aroused anymore and have an orgasm !
and can you ?
yeah .
it' s good news .
i can !
okay .
i want out of this relationship .
jerry , don' t say that .
you know i need you .
need me ?
how can you need me when all these positive feelings happen with everyone but me ?
not everybody .
just ron keller .
he reminds me of my father .
i remind you of your father .
you remind me of the good parts .
he reminds me of the bad .
i figured i should try everything .
you know , to figure out what the problem is .
how did i get to be the good father ?
what am i , kris kringle ?
it is a maddening problem .
we had to try every kind of foreplay .
where' s the rifle ?
i' m going to blow my brains out .
don' t be so middle class !
i did it as much for you as for me .
oh , thank you .
for me ?
thank you so much for thinking of me .
well , it worked .
now i know that i can get excited .
very excited .
passionate !
i can have orgasms .
like the ones i had when we first started dating .
you know ?
multiple ones , where i claw the walls .
i' m so happy to hear this , amanda !
really .
this is just music to my ears .
i don' t need the rifle .
i' il just hemorrhage here on the carpet .
jerry , don' t be mad .
and don' t be mad at ron .
he was just trying to help .
ron ?
how could i be upset at ron ?
in fact , i' il put him on my christmas list , if i can figure out how to make a letter bomb .
jerry ...
jerry , please .
please .
you know i love you so much .
i need you .
i can' t live without you .
jerry , please ?
that' s bullshit , falk .
i don' t buy any of it .
she says she did it therapeutically .
that' s the kind of therapy they advertise on the back of the village voice .
she wanted to make sure she could still become aroused .
well , i' m glad to hear the little sweetheart can still ...
you know , it' s not in vino veritas .
it' s in eros veritas .
i don' t know what to do , dobel .
i' m totally confused .
you said it .
you' re afraid to sleep alone .
that' s the whole story .
you surround yourself with this farrago of baby sitters , this loving disabled sex kitten who' s driving you crazy , the jew manager , you know ?
let me tell you , i am of the hebrew persuasion , but that guy who handles you is a member of one of the lost tribes of lsrael that should have remained lost .
and you got this shrink who , like god , never speaks and , like god , is dead .
there' s nothing wrong with being afraid .
we were meant to be afraid .
that' s why you have to build a survival kit .
do you have a little time now ?
i want to chat with you .
it' s just a joint , but they have great chinese food .
we' re in luck .
there' s a guy pulling out .
let me speak to you about something .
i have an acquaintance out in california who produces and he' s doing some comedy shows on television .
i know they' re looking for teams of writers .
if i told them that you and i were a team , i think we could get hired .
in california ?
yeah .
all the action is out there .
it' s not here .
i don' t know what amanda would say .
though her mother' s always wanted to go to hollywood .
can i explain something ?
i' m talking about a clean break .
me with the board of education , and you with everybody .
with that fish peddler , garment center manager you have , with your shrink and with that little girl who gives you a hard time .
i can' t just leave ... go by myself ?
not go by yourself .
go with me .
we' d go together so you can' t fall back on being alone .
i' ve given it a lot of thought , falk , and i know for me , it' s now or never .
think about it .
just think about it .
hey !
hey , i was waiting for this space for five minutes .
i was here for five minutes , waiting ...
you got a problem with me parking here ?
you been waiting ?
too bad .
you slow , you blow .
i' m a busy man .
i have things to do .
but i was ...
what , are you high on crack to be arguing with him ? !
i was waiting here for five minutes !
you want to meet god ?
do you ?
get out of here !
go home , old man .
do what the man says .
go , before i kick you in the ass !
get in your car and go home .
and you , turn around !
idiots !
my god , dobel .
either one of those guys could have beat you to a pulp .
is it so important you insist ?
life' s unfair .
you said it yourself .
those guys have the muscles and we' re blessed with wit .
later on , in the quiet and safety of some delicatessen , we can write a biting satire and expose all their foibles and have a great , big laugh .
two jerks .
but in the meantime , they' ve got the biceps .
what are you doing ?
why are you parking ?
dobel , what are you doing ?
why are we back here ?
what is that for ?
dobel !
oh , my god .
dobel !
dobel !
dobel , let' s go !
my god .
you' re sick in the head , you know that ?
crazy !
start the car .
what are you doing ?
i had mixed feelings over the day .
on the one hand , i was convinced dobel was a raving , psychotic lunatic .
on the other hand , i had a kind of odd admiration for him .
i would have just slinked away , bullied .
you know ?
but he wouldn' t let the injustice rest .
he resisted .
there are always some people who will resist .
and , as he says , the issue is always fascism .
he' s nuts .
and yet the thought of giving up everything here and starting fresh in california , it' s so tempting and exhilarating .
why do i get so scared ?
because i' m not a leaver .
the one time amanda and i broke up , she left me .
it all happened too fast .
i was overwhelmed by you .
it was a whirlwind and right away , we were living together !
i think we' d both benefit by some time apart .
i don' t need time apart .
i know i love you .
well , i do !
i can' t think .
i get these migraines and sometimes , my throat closes up and i can' t breathe .
i feel trapped and suffocated !
maybe if we slept with the window open .
i' il move in with april .
what if you return to a shrink ?
i told you , shrinks don' t work for me .
i know how to fool them .
just all that talk about how we were made for each other , and marriage , i ...
she moved out .
i was miserable .
eating moo goo gai pan out of boxes every night , having dreams of death .
i tried dating , but it was hard getting her out of my mind .
why don' t you come to the ladies ' room ?
the door locks .
we can be alone .
the wine has put me , um , very much in the mood .
okay .
i' il count to 30 and meet you in the ladies ' room .
meet me where ?
i' m sorry .
my mind was somewhere else .
then , a few weeks later , just as suddenly as she moved out ,
amanda returned .
i' m back .
but if you don' t want me , i understand .
you' re back ?
i couldn' t be without you .
i tried , but i just couldn' t .
you didn' t move in with your girlfriend april , like you said .
i found out you went to naples with tony hanken .
well , you can understand .
he wanted me to go with him to naples and rome .
it sounded so romantic .
those are places i' ve dreamed of .
i thought that' s what i wanted .
but i missed you too much .
but of course you made love with him .
yes , but i thought of you .
you were really the person i was making love to in naples and florence and venice , on the airplane 40, 000 feet in the air ...
okay .
enough .
oh , yeah ... and at the vatican .
all i could think about while we were doing it was how much you would love that ceiling .
so i' m back .
i' m home because ...
i can' t live without you .
we made love that night .
it was wonderful .
if only certain moments in life could last , just stay frozen , like some old vase .
paula , would you keep it down ?
you' re going to wake amanda .
jerry , you haven' t met ralph .
this is ralph !
can you keep it down ?
amanda' s ... we saw elaine stritch on broadway tonight .
she was magnificent !
unbelievable !
i wish i could do that !
you can .
i can .
i mean , i have a voice .
i just need some snappy dialogue from you , jerry .
absolutely .
i' m sorry .
i' m , uh ...
ralph , don' t give me much .
i' ve never had cocaine before .
okay , just a little .
is that coc ... what are you ...
is that , uh ... ?
it' s blow .
blow ?
what are you doing with blow ?
and on my computer ?
you' re such a stick in the mud !
you can partake .
i' m not going to partake .
what is going on ?
i said they' d wake you .
mother , you know how difficult it is for me to sleep .
i took two sleeping pills tonight .
we saw elaine stritch on broadway .
you want some cocaine ?
no , we don' t want any cocaine , amanda .
i' ve never tried it .
i' ve never tried lots of things !
bungee jumping , alligator wrestling .
i' d have a little .
you don' t know what you' re doing !
no fears , jerry .
ralph knows exactly what he' s doing .
nothing to worry about .
great .
i won' t be a part of this .
you are so goddamn prissy !
thank you very much , paula .
she has a point .
you' re never up for anything .
i' m up for things that you' re not up for .
okay ?
what is that supposed to mean ?
nothing .
i' m not going to snort cocaine , okay ?
i' m a nice , square jewish boy , okay ?
i' m not putting anything up my nose .
my god , paula !
are you kidding me ?
i don' t know .
i do it right ?
it' il make you feel sexy , jerry .
does it ?
does it make you feel sexy ?
sexy .
this could be interesting .
some people it makes feel sexy .
other it makes belligerent .
with my luck , you' il take a knife to me .
come on , just do a line !
you know what this does to your nasal membranes ?
eats them raw .
just do some with me .
no !
maybe it' il turn me on .
darling , have a drink .
i have to talk to dobel .
it' s just a social thing .
it' s not like we' re drug addicts .
they snorted cocaine !
can you believe that ?
my mother fed me cheerios .
she' s giving her daughter coke !
by the way , it did not solve our problem in bed .
i was not making eyes at my mother' s boyfriend .
god , you' re so paranoid .
why would i be interested in a horse whisperer who lives in topanga canyon and has one of those giant suvs and stupid german shepherds and chain saws .
how do you know so much about him ?
well , he was interesting to talk to .
so you' re saying you' re on the defensive because you wouldn' t snort cocaine ?
it' s not the cocaine .
it' s the principle .
what principle ?
and , you know , she' s not entirely wrong .
i mean , i am too rigid and disciplined .
what is this ?
you don' t want to know .
what is it , a monologue for some alleged comedian who thinks to be offensive is in itself enough to be funny ?
i wish it were .
i certainly can' t write at home anymore .
what is it ?
my contract extension with harvey .
unsigned , of course .
you don' t understand , okay ?
if i don' t re up with him , he will truly die .
he' il commit suicide .
i understand .
no , i understand completely .
what are you doing ?
dobel , what the hell are you doing ? !
what is wrong with you ? !
where are you meeting him ?
what did you do ? !
at lsabella' s .
what did you do ?
well , go in and tell him it' s over .
tell him you and i are going to california to write as a team .
are you insane ?
why did you tear this up ? !
because you' re not spending five more minutes with this guy , much less seven years with this fumbling vantz who robs you blind with a sliding scale .
i can' t tell him it' s over , dobel .
i cannot ...
i' il go with you .
i' il sit in the place while you tell him .
i' il give you moral support .
and don' t beat around the bush .
once you tergiversate , you' re lost .
i' m sorry i' m late .
my mom has this hyperactive thyroid .
sorry .
i ran into dick mallory .
he' s working with a comic who needs material .
i naturally told him your price .
i said , you know , what you get .
the kid works dirty .
a lot of bathroom jokes .
i said , " look , jerry falk is a professional .
lf what you need are bathroom jokes , he can do them .
harvey ?
what' s wrong with your voice ?
we should talk .
yeah .
that' s the way i am .
i always like to settle business before the meal .
this way , you can relax and enjoy lunch .
you brought the contract , right ?
harvey ... there' s no question that you were there for me from the start .
and if you think it' s easy selling an 1 8 year old unknown ... it' s a jungle out there .
and , and you' ve done a very professional job .
and i' ve paid you ...
i mean , the sliding scale .
you know , even though it slid toward you .
now ... now i see myself moving in a whole new direction .
meaning ?
basically , i' m interested in more serious things .
a novel , maybe some plays , maybe not even comedy .
the dollars are in the jokes .
funny is money .
i mean , you know , as a hobby , later , when you' re rich someday , if you want to try a book ... fine .
although ... the young kids are not readers .
harvey ...
what ?
you' re all flushed .
i' m not going to re sign with you .
what ?
now i know this may be a little , uh , disappointing to you , but i' m moving to california and reevaluating my priorities .
you' re what ?
i' m not going to need a manager .
you' re not re signing with me ?
it' s not the end of the world .
you' re dumping me ?
no , not dumping .
i' m moving .
i' m changing my goals .
don' t take it badly .
no !
my life ...
my life is over .
you' re not re signing with me ? !
harvey , calm down .
but my future !
my plans !
the humiliation !
you' re dumping me !
you' re overreacting .
you ungrateful , phony , two timing ... you louse !
folks , this is not what you think .
i' ve invested all my dreams in you !
i' m leaving town .
what have i done wrong ? !
nothing .
how have i failed you ? !
you' ve been great .
can we discuss this elsewhere ?
this is the loyalty i get for years of struggle ? !
harvey , not everybody signs every contract for life .
the room is turning black !
turning black !
air !
air !
dobel !
dobel !
he' s firing me !
this is the payoff i get !
i' m out !
he' s taking it badly .
pains in my chest !
can we get some brandy for him ?
please reconsider .
tell him to reconsider .
i' il go home and think about it .
listen to me !
he' s not reconsidering .
he' s moving on .
get on with your life .
everybody , stand back .
relax .
oh , my god !
there seems to be a pulse beat here .
what have i done ?
we should get an ambulance .
an ambulance ?
what have i done ?
oh , my god !
relax .
the paramedics will pound on the chest .
i killed him !
i shouldn' t have listened to you .
sometimes the victim comes back .
you don' t need a manager .
well , maybe not , but i don' t need him to die .
relax !
if he dies because you don' t sign a contract with him , then you should have nothing to do with him .
harvey ?
harvey did not die .
as dobel predicted , he survived .
i walked around in the city , trying to get my thoughts in order .
whenever i' m unsure or troubled , i take to the city streets .
walking in new york clears my head .
i couldn' t deny it .
there was a feeling of freedom , of exhilaration .
hey !
hi !
hey .
jerry , you remember connie .
connie , nice to see you .
i invited her for dinner .
you' re cooking ?
yes .
i' m making spaghetti .
he makes fun of me because i only know how to make spaghetti for eight people .
i can' t change the recipe proportionally .
so tonight we' il be having five extra portions .
i have news !
i' ve parted ways with harvey .
oh .
the spaghetti for eight is terrific .
let me explain what happened .
there i am , having a nice time , a little drunk .
i have two drinks and i' m ready to hold up a brink' s truck .
i start to see what it is about connie that amanda had raved about .
she was very charming and pretty and smart .
i started to get the feeling that she was finding me engaging .
i' ve never found conventionally handsome men attractive .
i much prefer faces with character .
i' ve fallen for some pretty odd looking men in my life .
after dinner , i found myself alone in the kitchen with connie and wanting to touch her .
i say this because it was the first time since meeting amanda
i' d even looked at another woman .
and i began to feel that maybe the time had come for me to pack up and start over in california with dobel .
i' m terminating our sessions and moving to california with dobel .
there' s a job waiting for us .
i' il miss new york , but if i can accumulate enough money ,
i can return and work on my own projects .
what do you think about my decision ?
what do you think about it ?
i told them i' m leaving .
i gave notice and i won' t starve .
i' ve saved some money .
the thing i' il miss most is the kids .
the kids are wonderful .
bright .
you should see the creative ways they smuggle weapons past the metal detectors .
it' s amazing .
now you have to tell amanda .
i know .
and don' t tergiversate .
did i tergiversate with harvey ?
huh ?
no .
i don' t even know what the hell " tergiversate " means , so how can i tergiversate ?
ahh , she' il die .
amanda ?
amanda , i want to talk with you .
hi .
hi .
i want to talk about something .
i need to talk to you , too .
i think i should go first , ' cause it' s pretty serious .
me , too .
can we sit down ?
yeah , i think we should sit .
i' m moving to los angeles .
i' m moving out .
what ?
i want to be totally honest with you , jerry .
i' ve met someone and developed very strong feelings for him .
you met someone ?
yes .
have you been having an affair ?
no , and i don' t want to .
i can' t do all that lying and sneaking around .
well , where did you meet him ?
in passing .
you must have spent time with him to have feelings for him .
we' ve had a few drinks , nothing heavy .
just a few chats .
so you have been seeing someone .
i' ve had a couple of casual conversations .
you slept with him ?
my god , jerry .
what do you think i am ?
have you ?
once .
and very quickly .
i had to see if we were sexually compatible .
i refused to let myself have an affair .
that' s why i' m being so honest .
i want to be straightforward .
i' m at a loss for words .
i , uh , i ...
i don' t know what to say .
i' m completely taken aback .
i' il be moving out .
everything will be clean and honest .
mom will stay here till phil and i get settled .
phil ?
it' il only be a month , until phil' s divorce comes through .
no .
your mother' s not staying here .
i said i' m moving to california .
i won' t be here .
that' s so great !
did you get a job out there ?
yes .
dobel and i , on a tv show .
that' s wonderful .
you' il knock ' em dead out there .
idiots who are total losers in new york go to l. a. and become millionaires .
god , this is so much better this way .
it was unfair , the way we were living , you having to put up with my stupid inability to function sexually and me hating myself all the time .
this is sad , but it' s for the best .
you know what would be kind of romantic ?
if we were to make love , just one last time .
for old times ' sake .
i thought you couldn' t .
everything' s different now .
the psychodynamic has changed .
who knows ?
maybe we' il end up having an affair .
i did it !
i did it .
i cut all the ties .
i feel free and exhilarated
iike i' m falling through space .
i feel confident and i' m very positive , but also like i' m buried alive .
i don' t know .
i' m sure once we get to l. a. and start working ...
speaking of which , i just bought some luggage .
what' s wrong ?
you sound all weird .
where ?
now ?
i don' t think i know where that spot in the park is .
where is it ?
all right .
i' il find it .
you' re late !
could you pick a more secluded spot ?
did anyone follow you ?
no !
no one followed me .
wait until i tell you what amanda said .
i have to explain something to you .
due to circumstances , i think i should really get away to a less conspicuous venue .
maybe like alaska or something .
what are you talking about ?
you have to go by yourself .
i' m not going .
what ?
you have the job .
it' s there waiting for you .
it' s all done .
no , no , no .
that' s not the deal .
we go as a team , dobel .
you' re grown up .
you can handle it alone .
i don' t understand .
what happened ?
you don' t want to know .
you can' t cop out and not give me an explanation .
i' ve changed my whole life around .
what happened ?
just some nonsense , falk .
you know .
the other night , i was out of state .
don' t ask me where .
the less you know , the better .
i was trying to sell my car to a potential buyer as a preamble to our trip to california .
and i was coming home , speeding a little bit .
what' s the fun of having a car like that if you can' t get a little velocity going ?
and i was stopped by two state troopers .
they were exceptionally nasty , and one thing led to another .
they made some remarks and got physical , and i made some remarks , and they got a little rough , and the next thing i knew , they made some crack about my religion , which i found in poor taste .
religion ?
you' re an atheist .
yes , i' m an atheist , but ... but i resented the fact , however obliquely that they implied auschwitz was basically a theme park .
anyhow , a little bloodied , i returned to my apartment and got one of my many weapons , and i returned to find them .
don' t you dare tell me you shot them .
i couldn' t find both of them , only one .
as fate turned out , i located the more porcine of the two .
how serious ?
in a satirical mood , i thought it would be amusing if i shot him in the ass , but it was dark and i was nervous , and , you know , time has diminished my accuracy .
dobel !
dobel !
my god !
i always knew i would use the survival kit one day .
it' s just for a period of time until everything blows over , i suppose .
god .
oh , dobel .
dobel .
i never knew if dobel' s story was true orjust a piece of fiction he used to get me to go alone .
i never saw or heard from him again .
for all i know , he' s ice fishing somewhere in the yukon .
i thought a lot about that strange , sad , improbable character and remembered very fondly our afternoons in central park .
in life , they' il be no shortage of people who' il tell you how to live .
they' il have all the answers ... what you should do and not do .
don' t argue with them .
say , " yes , that' s a brilliant idea , " and do what you want .
whenever you write , strive for originality , but if you have to steal , steal from the best .
and if you take very good care of your styptic pencil and dry it after every shave , it' il last longer than most relationships you' re in .
that even a clock that' s broken is right twice a day .
dobel had a real sense of irony and would have appreciated that i got one last , to use his word , adventitious glimpse of amanda as i was leaving for jfk .
the doctor !
i knew that doctor was hot for her .
what' d you say ?
i was just saying how strange life is , how full of inexplicable mystery .
well , you know , it' s like anything else .
# you' d be
# so easy to love
# so easy to idolize
# all others above
# so worth the yearning for
# so swell to keep every home fire burning for
# we' d be
# so grand at the game
# so carefree together that it
# does seem a shame
# that you can' t see
# your future with me
# ' cause you' d be oh so easy to love
