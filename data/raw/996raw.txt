hairy palms .
you know what we haven' t done for years ?
remember bruno hakalugi , the italian wrestler ?
remember where bruno meets the invisible man ?
why don' t we do it where you play the samurai warrior ?
i' il be bruno hakalugi , and we' il do the wrestling skit .
i used to love that skit .
welcome to championship wrestling .
i' m your host , jerry dumphy .
with me tonight is three time world heavyweight champion , mike mcgraw .
welcome to the show , iron mike .
thank you , jerry .
we have an excellent card on top for you tonight between the italian bruno hakalugi and his team partner , japanese ltchy scratchy .
how do the boys look for you , iron mike ?
the italian looks pretty good .
the jap looks good .
they both look good .
their opponent tonight is none other than the world famous champion from nowhere .
the invisible man .
what do you think of him , iron mike ?
well , i haven' t seen too much of him lately .
in fact , no one has .
cos he' s invisible .
but i think it' s going to be a good match .
hakalugi and ltchy scratchy are certainly showing him no respect .
they' re not showing him any respect at all .
but i don' t think the invisible man is scared of them either .
they' re deciding who is going to go in the ring first .
yeah , they' re deciding who is going to go in the ring first .
they' re having quite a discussion .
i can' t understand what they' re saying .
the invisible man is ready .
i think it' s going to be the italian .
there goes the bell .
here we go .
it' s no holds barred texas rules , no referee and no pay cheque for the loser .
and he gets hits by a shot out of nowhere .
and another shot out of nowhere .
he' s down already .
quite a mess .
looks like the italian' s in trouble .
got him in a lock .
and now he' s got the japanese guy .
itchy scratchy into the ring .
he' s looking around .
looking for a sneak attack .
and he' s hit his rim .
and another rim shot .
that' s illegal , but there' s no referee so it doesn' t matter .
he bit him .
that' s good wrestling .
biting is allowed .
another rim shot .
here comes bruno hakalugi into the ring .
what is he doing ?
he' s probably digging for crabs .
he' s eating garlic .
he' s going to give him a garlic blowjob .
the japanese is down .
and now the knee drop !
and into the corner .
hard to get out this .
that' s pretty tough on the back .
that' s right , iron mike .
look at that one .
he' s got him in the " got ya " .
he' s got his hands full now .
he' s really stretching .
he' s slipped out .
must be the grease on his hands .
and he gives him another stretch .
and another stretch .
and over his shoulder for the volga boatman , marching to moscow .
he' s down now .
couldn' t see where he was going .
you can' t see invisible balls .
that' s right .
he' s got him in the bass , man !
that' s not orthodox wrestling .
he we go into double dutch .
listen to them hit the ground .
i' d say the invisible man' s in a lot of trouble .
he looks pretty tied up .
i bet he can get out of it .
hakalugi is going to make a four corner run .
that really hurts , let me tell you .
it happened to me once .
hakalugi is down .
itchy scratchy too .
and the invisible man wins .
those balls are pretty dangerous when they' re flapping around .
hey , cheech !
how can you stay in there that long ?
you know one skit we got to do ?

we' re gonna do a show for you anyway .
and ...
we want to start off with a dude who had his arm blown off during the war .

there are a lot of important people .
they even expect the queen will come .
all the people from the secret service ...
don' t use the word " bums " , don' t use those languages .
i know what a lot of you people out there are thinking .

let me tell you , ladies and gentlemen .
the act of which i speak ... is that i ... am the only person in the world who can play the trumpet ... out his nose .
that' s right .
and not only that .
i will make this trumpet sound like a slide trombone .
i would like to play a tune called ,
nobody knows about me cares and nobody cares about me nose " .
