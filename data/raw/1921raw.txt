i' m gonna finish this .
hey , mr. erection , you want a date ?
the room is 20 .

fuck it anyway !
next , please .

that one' s on the house , son .
were you in los angeles for the earthquake ?
it was pretty scary .
did you have a lot of damage ?
just a little bit .
are you desirable ?
are you irresistible ?
maybe if you drank bourbon with me , it would help .
if you kissed me , and i could taste the sting in your mouth , it would help .
if you drank bourbon with me naked ... if you smelled of bourbon as you fucked me , it would help .
it would increase my esteem for you ... if you poured bourbon on your naked body and said to me , " drink this .
if you spread your legs and you had bourbon dripping from your breasts ... and your pussy and said , " drink here " ... then i could fall in love with you .
because then i would have a purpose : to clean you up .
and that would prove ... that i' m worth something .
i' d lick you clean so that you could go away and fuck someone else .
our business is to make our customers happy .
next , please .
i am back .
i' ve got my check , and , baby , i' m ready to sign .

where you from , yuri ?
you sure don' t sound like you come from around these parts .
that is very true .
very good observation .
i am from latvia .

it' s amazing .
i haven' t worked for a really long time ... and i can just turn on a dime .
i can just become who they want me to be .
i walk into that room , i know right away ... this is their fantasy , and i become it .
i' m that service .
i perform it , and i perform it well .
i' m an equation mostly .
thirty minutes of my body costs $300 .
that' s just to get into the room .
it' s about $500 after that .
we negotiate .
but it' s a performance .
it' s definitely a performance .
i am very pleased with how you' ve moved up in the world .
it is , after all , a glamorous world i showed you .
why did you leave me in los angeles ?
because you are sly .
you knew there was more money here in las vegas .
you don' t need to fear me , sera ... because we belong together .
don' t we ?
are you lonely ?
i am lonely , yuri .
so am l .
janek , we called you last night !
there was no one home .
we' re 30 miles outside of las vegas .

i walk , you stop .
are you sorry ?

i walked into the room , and he was lying on the bed .
he had his arms behind his head ... and there was just hair everywhere .
he was really , really fat .
he had a large erection .
i remember he was so proud of his large erection .
i asked him where my money was , and he pointed to the dresser .
and then i asked him what he wanted ... and he said , " lie down , i' m on top .
he started pounding me really hard .
i had to bite my tongue to keep from crying .
he did that for awhile , and then i started to get up .
he pushed me back down , and he held my hair .
he was pulling it , and he stuck his penis in my mouth .
i tried to get up again , and he said ...
stay there , baby , i' m gonna come on your face .
so he did .
then he rubbed his semen all over my face and in my hair .
then he kicked me off the bed and told me to leave .
are you working ?
what do you mean ?
i' m walking .
just wait one second .
great ass !
want some ?
isn' t it illegal to drink and drive ?
that' s pretty funny .

you' re pretty drunk .
not really .
my room' s not far .
it' s the whole year lnn .

i kept running out of booze and the store would be closed ... because i forget to look at my watch .
i used to live in los angeles .

maybe you should give it a miss for tonight .
i don' t know , it' s just
i really like this guy .
i' ve never felt anything ... for anyone i' ve ever been with , as a trick .
it' s weird .
i feel kind of confused about it .
we were with each other only one night ... but i felt like the relationship
i felt like there was a relationship being formed .
i was kind of scared .
i don' t think i should see him again .
but i look for him .
i went out last night .
i was looking for him .
where' s your car ?
i sold it this morning .
i' m gonna take cabs from now on .
what' s it tonight ?
another 500 to watch you sleep ?
what' s up ?
i was looking for you tonight .
i don' t know if you have a boyfriend ... or a girlfriend ... but , if you have some free time ...
i thought maybe we could get some dinner .
are you serious ?
i think you know i' m serious .
i' il pay you if you like , but i just want to see you .
i can' t have dinner with you .
we could get prime rib .
they' ve got it on sale for $2 . 99 .

i' il do it .
this is the home of an angel .
are you okay ?
of course .
you look extremely beautiful .
i do ?
it' s really weird because ... you know ... it' s just like this thing' s happening ... really quickly .
i just don' t know what' s going on .
just the second i met him , and the way i said my name .
i just said , " hi , my name' s sera , " and that' s not what i do .
and it' s just
it' s all happening really quickly .
i just felt like we' ve been together for a long time .
it just felt so easy ... and i felt like
i felt like i was me .
i didn' t feel like i was ... trying to be somebody else .
when is your rent coming up at the motel ?
what do you mean ?
i think you should go and bring all your stuff over here .
sera , you are crazy .
so ?
don' t you think you' il get a little bored living with a drunk ?
that' s what i want .
you haven' t seen the worst of it .
these last few days , i' ve been very controlled .
i knock things over and throw up all the time .
right now i feel really good .
you' re like an antidote that mixes with the liquor and keeps me in balance .
but that won' t last forever .
all right , you go back to your motel .
i' il go back to my glamorous life of being alone .
the only thing i have to come home to is a bottle of mouthwash ... to take the taste of come out of my mouth .
i' m tired of being alone .
that' s what i' m tired of .
don' t you like me , ben ?
what you don' t understand is no .
see ?
no .
what ?
you can never , never ... ask me to stop drinking .
do you understand ?
i do .
i really do .
i' m nuts about you .
we didn' t know ...
whether to call the police .
he has been here about half an hour .
i know that  mickey had seen you two together .
i wasn' t opening the door .
i don' t know who , i don' t know where ...
i don' t know what , i don' t know whatever these days .
he' s my friend .
i' m sorry .
he must have had too much to drink .
that' s why i had him patch the key code .
because he' s not gonna do it .
i' il help him inside .
thank you so much .
i' m so sorry to bother you .
no trouble .
you just give me a call if you need any help .
ben , can you wake up ?
we gotta go inside , but i have some presents for you .
up we go .
here we go .
this is mrs. van houten .
this is ben .
outstanding , sir .
all right .
here we go .
you' re okay ?
i' m fine .
good .
i' m so sorry to bother you .
thank you for being so nice .
sure .
all right .
bye bye .
sorry .
i was miles away .
the gifts .
i love that name .
before we proceed onwards , there' s something i have to say .
i' ve come this far .
here i am , in your house .
let me pay this month' s rent .
why ?
because
because it' s better for me that way .
i' il tell you right now ...
i' m in love with you .
but , be that as it may , i am not here ... to force my twisted soul into your life .
i know that .
we both know i' m a drunk .
and i know you' re a hooker .
i hope you understand that i' m a person ... who is totally at ease with this ... which is not to say that i' m indifferent or i don' t care .
i do .
it simply means i trust and accept your judgment .
i was really worried about how that would be ... but now i' m not .
but you should know that included with the rent around here ... is a complimentary blow job .
i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck .
whatever that means .
open your presents .
presents !
all right .
open this one first .
very nice .
this should go very nicely with my suit ... which , by the way , is the only item of clothing ...
i brought over from the motel with me .
right .
the suitcase was clinking .
what did you do with your clothes ?
i threw them out , which was perhaps immoral ... but i wanted to come to you clean , so to speak .
thought we' d go shopping for a pair of jeans ... and 45 pairs of underwear , and just throw one out each day .
that' s nice talk , ben .
keep drinking .
between the 101 proof breath and the occasional drool ... some interesting words fall from your mouth .
it looks like i' m with the right girl .
i' m very impressed you would buy this for me .
i' m gonna fill it right now .
do you want to go gambling tonight ?
i was thinking we could go and just play for a few hours .
i hadn' t planned to gamble ... but if you could keep the bulk of my money ...
i could safely blow a couple hundred bucks .
giving you money makes me want to come .
then come .
i' m sorry .
i love you .
you got a 13 .
hit me .
wait .
she' s got a seven .
i don' t know .
you tell me .
hit .
i' m busted .
that' s all right .
you got it .
you can do it .
wait a minute !
really ?
oh , man !
what ?
he' s okay .
do you want anything ?
yeah , maybe a bloody mary .
can you make that ?
what ?
fuck you !
fuck !
you fucker !
that boy is you can' t judge me !
you !
i am his father !
get up !
let' s go , guys .
how are you ?
very well .
i never expected to have to ask this again ... but how did our evening go ?
i remember getting to the casino .
and i remember kissing you .
that was really nice .
and then playing blackjack ... and then security came .
but after that , everything' s a blank .
what happened ?
they wanted to carry you out and dump you onto the street ... but i talked them into letting me walk you out .
that' s impressive .
how did you do that ?
i told them that you were an alcoholic ... and that i would take you home ... and that we would never go in there ever again .
we " ?
that' s amazing .
what are you ?
some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies ?
how can you be so good ?
i don' t know what you' re saying .
i' m just using you .
i need you .
can we not talk about it anymore ?
not a word .
you go back to sleep ... and i' il go out and get us some breakfast .
will you be careful ?
don' t worry .
ben , i' m working tonight .
i know .
i fuckin ' talk all the time because you never fuckin ' listen to me !
so fuck you !
shut the fuck up .
i' d like a beer and a double kamikaze , please .
we mustn' t kick the bar .
we lean into the bar .
just lean into the railing .
it' s not vino veritaz .
it' s en vino veritaz .
who the fuck are you talking to ?
little brown nosed gnomes with a slingshot .
to be in drunk .
lean into the bar ?
you lean into the bar .
my boyfriend over there is really boring the shit out of me ... and i was wondering if you would buy me a drink ?
do you mind if i buy her a drink ?
i don' t care what you do with her .
i' il have a rum and coke , please .
barman , a rum and coke .
can i stay with you for awhile ?
you mean move in with me ?
lsn' t this a bit sudden ?
i don' t have a lot of things .
i don' t think my wife would dig it very much .
then maybe we should just go to a motel and fuck all day .
i could suck you like this .
i' m sure fucking you would be wonderful ... but it' s almost impossible for me to imagine being with someone else .
now listen , asshole , i' m not just gonna sit here ... and watch her suck on your ear !
shut the fuck up !
i am sorry ... but she and i have decided to spend a few hours together ... in a motel .
and after that , caviar .
baby , wait up !
you' re quite a fighter .
here .
listen , this may sound silly ... but i have to ask you to leave .
it' s what we do around here when there' s a fight .
the men' s room is around the back .
sexy .
i' m back .
oh , my god .
did i scare you ?
what happened ?
fuck , ben .
did you get in a fight ?
i thought you said you didn' t fight .
how do you feel ?
like the kling klang king of the rim ram room .
did you stop at a bar ?
did you say something stupid to somebody stupid ?
absolutely not .
i was defending the honor of some poor wayward maiden .
i bet you were .
why don' t you go take a shower and put on your other shirt ?
then we' il go shopping and buy you some new clothes .
i think this shirt is unlucky .
not at all .
your blood tastes good .
we got eggs .
i always had a fantasy of being a flamenco dancer .
i think you look great .
we' il just get you a bow tie ... and then you can be one of those blackjack dealers .
all right ?
they wear it because they have to .
i' il wear it because i want to ... which will make me look different .
let' s get a drink !
what is that ?
what ?
holy cow .
it came out of your ear !
i didn' t have time to write you a card ... with you breathing down my neck all day ... so you' il just have to wing it , baby .
open it .
they' re your color .
i think you should wear one of them at a time .
one of these and one of your other ones .
i was gonna buy you just one ... but i didn' t think it would fly .
nurse !
as a gift , i mean .
i' il wear them tonight .
one of them .
tonight .
put it on .
i can' t get it .
i' il help you .
you' il be able to feel it , sharp and hot under your ear ... as one of the brothers is putting your head facedown ... into one of the penthouse pillows .
wait !
maybe you should wait .
why ?
you can tell .
she really wants you to .
maybe i should follow you around ... and ask one of your tricks what it' s like to sleep with you .
they wouldn' t know .
maybe you should ask me sometime .
be happy to show you .
