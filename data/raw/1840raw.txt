you gotta do something about your schooling .
i don' t know how you made it to the 1 2th grade .
i don' t know what they discuss in class .
thing is , your lq tests say something completely different .
you' re just behind , but you cannot skate through this school ...
... like your others .
some days i have to leave early .
i don' t want to hear about you ditching .
it' s not ditching .
i need a job to make money .
gracie , making money is not as important as going to school .
now , look , i can' t help you at home , but i can make sure you do your best here .
i am doing the best that i can .
and i think you can do a lot better if you put your mind to it .
can i be excused ?
or whatever i' m supposed to say .

i hope that' s not giving you two any ideas .
well , i thought you wanted a grandbaby .
i do , but not yet .
where' s the powder room ?
the bathroom .
it' s through the door and to the left .
tommy , show gracie .
it' s okay .
i got it .
gracie , how do you like your burgers ?
cooked .
powder room ?
i keep telling your son he has to visit some colleges ... ... and make some decisions .
what colleges are you looking into ?
i hadn' t really thought about it .
well , you' d better .
there' s lots of competition .
oh , are you still hungry ?
lf no one' s gonna eat them , may i take them to my brothers ?
my grandma has a microwave  of course not .
we have some buns .
we got some cookies .
get some containers .
they' re just little children .
what am i supposed to do ?
rowena , i have asked you not to smoke in my house .
oh , okay .
that franco fellow is upstairs asleep on my bed ... ... and little robbie told me that he saw you in there with him ... ... doing exercises with him ... ... and i know them exercises .
ln front of your own children !
what am i supposed to do ?
there was no lock on the door .
well , i' m sorry , though .
i mean , that oh , god .
i don' t want the kids to see me like that , either .
i mean , what am i supposed to do ?
i don' t have much .
he' s all i' ve got .
rowena , the children are so upset .
they' ve promised not to tell anybody that you' re here , but they' re little children ... ... and robbie , he doesn' t understand .
oh , god .
your daddy , this would just about kill him .
listen , rowena , that check is gonna come tomorrow ... ... and why don' t you and your man take the check .
why don' t y' all just leave , because you know what ?
it would really be best for everybody .
i bring nothing but misery .
i didn' t say that .
no , you did .
you might as well .
let me get franco .
i' il get out of your hair .
please come to mama .
listen to me , honey .
lf you just get back into the church ....
mom .
why don' t you admit i should have never been born .
oh , god .
don' t say that , rowena .
you' re my baby .
oh , god .
i will not turn you out .
my sweet baby .
my little baby .
oh , my god .
i love you so much .
i love you too , mama .
oh , my baby .
god , i love you .
we know your mother' s at your grandmother' s .
i just have to ask you one question .
are there any relatives that would take you and your siblings ?
not that i know of .
we' il have to find foster homes .
you' re not separating us .
we' ve been through that .
it' s not juvenile hall .
they take the kids for the money .
i' m not stupid .
look , i' il get my mother out of the house .
it won' t work .
your grandma will take her back .
she says she won' t , but she does .
i' il take them .
i' il take them .
i' il get an apartment away from grandma , and i' il save up my money .
that money is for junior college .
i can always make more .
gracie , you' re 1 7 years old .
you have to be a legal adult to be a foster parent .
you' d have to be emancipated .
i can do that ?
yeah .
even then , a judge would have to go for it .
that' s too much on your shoulders .
it has always been on my shoulders .
look , this is a solution .
you can' t separate us .
i' il be their mother .
you ... ... are not their mother !
ls this so you can get the caregiver money ?
you are doing this to get the money .
this is all a setup !
she gets the money , and she gives it to you .
only because it belongs to me , you bitch !
no , don' t curse your daughter like that !
you shut up !
you are not taking my kids !
your kids ?
just admit that you had us for the welfare money .
too bad you had so many miscarriages because there would have been more !
you go to hell !
i was born in hell !
they are never going to give them to you .
not to you .
just leave ... ... before i call the cops .
oh , my little baby grandchild .
i love you .
oh , god .
we can run away .
we don' t have any wheels .
we could take a bus , get jobs and find a place to live .
wyoming .
we can' t run away , guys .
that' s how mom deals with her problems , by skipping town .
we have to ask the court .
you take care of us , so why do we have to ask the court ?
judges are smart and listen to both sides ... ... and they figure out what' s best for us , right ?
we already know what' s best for us .
why don' t i read you guys a story .
we' ve read bambi about 1 00 times .
don' t knock it .
it' s the only book we' ve got .
i don' t think you know what you' re doing .
you understand they must stay in school ?
yes , sir .
you' re employed part time .
you have a work permit ?
yes , sir .
through the school .
this has been a very trying day .
i' ve had half a dozen children who had to be placed .
well , your school records have certainly improved .
mrs. thurston ?
yes , your honor ?
you' re a counselor at gracie' s school .
what' s your assessment ?
gracie is doing extremely well , and i' m also encouraging her to apply for college .
all of the children are making an effort .
ryan and robbie are in special day classes , and jonny' s pulling in a' s .
what happens to them when gracie' s at work ?
my grandmother can come to my apartment after school ... ... or there' s foster family daycare .
i know it' s not perfect , but it' s very important to me ... ... and to my brothers that we stay together .
where is the mother , rowena larson ?
i talked to her yesterday .
she said she would be here .
well , how did these children get here today ?
easy .
we took the bus .
you don' t have a car ?
we' re getting one .
look , i don' t understand this money problem with your grandmother .
she' s getting $520 a month for each child .
the thing is , your honor , my grandmother gives the money to my mother .
we don' t ever see it .
gracie buys us our shoes and stuff , sir .
i mean , your honor .
the money would have to go directly to you .
that' s gonna make grandma really mad .
because my mother will raise hell about it .
i mean , heck .
you don' t have to worry about her .
just worry about these kids .
you got a checking account ?
i can get one .
what about an apartment ?
i found one .
it has to be approved .
how will you handle it ?
you got telephone , electricity .
these children gotta have their own bed , dresser .
yes , i have the list .
this is ridiculous .
i' il give you a week to get it all in order .
i can do it , judge .
well , if you can do all that , maybe we should give you a job around here .
okay .
this is just temporary , but we' re gonna give it a three month trial .
but i' m gonna be watching you .
i want reports from the doctor , the dentist ... ... and copies of report cards .
this is highly unusual , but i' m giving you a chance to keep your family together .
i hope it doesn' t come back to haunt me .
thank you , judge donner .
thank you .
next case .
tough neighborhood .
i don' t know .
it' s better than most places we' ve lived , and we can stay in the same schools .
well ... ... you' re gonna have to clean it up .
i have plenty of experience scrubbing out bathtubs and cupboards .
well , put some pictures up .
family stuff .
make it cozy and warm .
i' il be back in a week .
does that mean you approve it ?
done .
you did this without telling me ?
i was afraid you' d think i was nuts .
no , my parents think you' re nuts .
i , on the other hand , think you' re incredible .
i didn' t have a choice .
before i know it , i' m picking out beds .
what do you think of this one ?
it' s way too soft .
you know what ?
we got a twin bed in the garage .
okay , how much money you got ?
i' ve saved a few thousand , and with the foster care money
wait a minute .
you' ve been saving your money in a sock ?
yeah , underneath the mattress .
why didn' t you just put it in the bank , you know ?
earn some interest .
what' s that ?
the bank pays you a percentage for the use of your money .
free money ?
that is a great , great idea .
this thing' s awesome !
go , gracie , go !
go , gracie , go !
grandma ... ... could you cut this for me right there on that line ?
left , left , left , right , left .
up the stairs .
left , left , left , right , left .
we found a kitten !
can we keep him , please ?
yes , we can .
you all are gonna be taking care of him , okay ?
what do we call him ?
lobo .
that' s a good name .
okay , thank you , jonny .
that' s good enough .
what did i tell you ?
we do not jump on the furniture .
put it in the corner .
thank mrs. turner when we give it back to her .
we don' t have any pictures , so what pictures do we put in the frames ?
keep the ones that are in there .
lsn' t mr. bessey supposed to be here ?
i' m late for my open house .
don' t worry .
he will be here .
now can we go out and play ?
no , i don' t want you guys getting all dirty again .
mr. bessey is never late , so something must have come up .
okay , that' s him .
okay , come on .
come on , come on , come on .
okay , everybody ready ?
clean hands ?
elbows ?
okay , good .
this is such bull !
we' re gonna miss the whole thing .
calm down , ryan .
hello .
i' m sandy jacobs .
i' m your social worker .
hi .
you know what ?
there might be a mistake .
bob bessey , mr. bessey , he' s actually our social worker .
your file' s on my desk now .
that' s the way it works .
okay .
you' re late .
sorry .
traffic .
yeah , right .
we have a phone .
you could' ve called .
they' re upset because they had an open house at school tonight .
yeah , it started an hour ago .
yes , well , this takes precedence over an open house at school .
it' s very homey .
you have gas , electricity ?
look at our kitten , lobo .
it means " wolf " because he bites .
we got our teeth cleaned .
me too .
yes , i have the reports .
who are these people ?
aunt beth ann and uncle mike .
and where do they live ?
portland .
they do ?
okay , i noticed in the report that your grandma lou checks here regularly .
we have a stable support line .
very stable .
and i noticed that brian has communication problems .
do you mean ryan ?
oh , yes , ryan .
sorry .
so many families .
so many children .
i don' t wanna upset him .
i would rather discuss this in private .
i think you should consider counseling for him .
that that' s a great idea .
i will do that .
okay , well , i have to make my report to the judge .
all in all , i would say , " good job .
i' m gonna grant you a three month extension .
good work , boys .
grace , i have got to hand it to you .
you have a lot of patience .
and you' re a better mother than i ever was .
grandma , we never could have done all this without you .
who drank all the milk ?
lf you drink all the milk , we don' t have anything left for the week .
why couldn' t we get cereal ?
because it' s too expensive .
ryan will eat the whole box .
it' s got too much sugar .
you' re hyper enough .
gracie , who are those guys ?
mind your own business .
get in the car .
down , robbie !
get down !
gracie !
gracie !
stay down , robbie !
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
you can' t give us any description of the shooters ?
you didn' t notice the make , the color of either vehicle ?
i was covering up my brother .
that' s all i thought about .
where exactly were you ?
where were you ?
don' t talk to my sister like that .
she pays taxes !
show some respect .
you were caught in a crossfire .
they shot our car !
through the door , the rear view mirror , the windshield !
they blew a tire off !
my sister came home  ryan , get a grip !
go upstairs .
i' il be up in a minute .

excuse my brother .
he thinks he' s my husband .
this is all so terrible .
you could have been killed .
grandma !
robbie , honey , go upstairs and get ready for bed .
take lobo .
jonny will read one of the stories we bought .
good night , mr. policeman .

gracie !

i want to get this .
cheese !
beautiful .
i am so proud of you .
congratulations .
i told you you could do it .
hey , there' s punch in the corner .
gracie , tommy , there you are .
congratulations .
thank you , mrs. thurston .
let' s get a picture .
i' m so proud of you .
i am sorry i was a pain in the ass .
i hated your guts .
don' t worry about it .
i hated yours too .
i got a job this summer doing books for an escrow company .
this from the girl who once told me she couldn' t do math ?
i' m loading numbers into a computer , that' s all .
whatever it is , you' re starting a new life and with a new scholarship .
now , that is the best news .
you proud of that ?
i can' t believe it .
boys , do you want to say hello to mrs. thurston ?
say hello .
hi , mrs. thurston .
so when were you gonna tell me ?
i don' t know .
i just got all messed up .
you found out you got a scholarship ... ... and you threw it away ?
how do i go to college and leave the boys ?
a few years
robbie' s 7 years old .
that' s a long time , gracie .
look , i just gotta know .
do you love me or not ?
tommy , you know that i do .
say it , gracie .
but i can' t turn my back on the boys .
even if i wanted to , i can' t .
let somebody adopt them .
it' s a good opportunity
lf anybody' s gonna adopt them , it' s gonna be me .
do you know what you just said ?
so you' re serious .
you' re gonna try and adopt them yourself ?
i don' t know what i' m gonna do .
look , the boys adore you ...
... and i know that you love them .
i love you , damn it !
i want to be with you !
i want to marry you !
i want us to have our own kids , not with them .
tommy , don' t say that .
you' ve got to make a choice .
look , i' m sorry , gracie .
i' m only 1 9 .
got my whole life ahead of me .
i can' t .
gracie , your family is ruining your life .
you don' t even see it .
you expect me to take this pro bono ?
i don' t expect anything .
i' m hoping .
do you know your mom will sign a release ?
i don' t .
the only way she' d sign it is if she was high on pot .
they' il assign her a lawyer .
you only get one shot in court .
you' d have to luck out with an understanding judge .
we had one before .
and what about the fathers ?
i don' t know who half of them are .
neither does my mother .
you have to get a hold of relatives .
you have to check out last known addresses .
you have to put ads in newspapers .
you' ve got to locate these people so parental rights can be terminated .
ancillary costs can add up .
i know .
i' m prepared .
i went through all of this stuff with an adoption worker .
there' s little or no precedent for this .
a person as young as you
are you gonna help me or not ?
robbie ?
don' t wrinkle it .
i just ironed it .
it' s an expensive shirt .
belonged to my boss .
come on .
we gotta get going .
we can' t be late .
it got a big stain .
tuck it in and it won' t show .
why can' t we ever get anything new ?
why don' t you start mowing more lawns ?
are you scrubbed good behind your ears ?
my hair okay ?
what is that smell ?
i used some of tommy' s cologne he left in the bathroom .
well , you used too much .
ls mom gonna be there ?
come on .
all right , i want you to sit over here .
you' re in charge .
do not talk to anyone , okay ?
excuse me , while i go barf my guts out .
would you mind if i had two of those ?
aspirin ?
yeah .
yeah , sure .
i come here this morning thinking i was doing some good ... ... and they took my children away from me .
what kind of people take babies away from their mothers ?
i don' t ....
sorry .
i mean ....
i hope i hope it works out for you .
it' s a great idea .
gracie' s gonna love it .
hi , gracie .
look who' s here , gracie .
well , hi there , gracie .
hey , what do you think ?
they said i should look respectable .
she looks pretty , doesn' t she ?
i do feel like my mother .
maybe i should add more lipstick .
you' re beautiful , mom .
you look you look fine .
mom wants to take us to wyoming .
well ....
we could all go .
gracie , you too .
you' re invited .
we could start over .
we can take lobo .
she' s gonna sell grandma lou' s house and buy one in wyoming .
we' re gonna have a ranch house with cottonwood trees and a pond and a pasture .
we' re gonna have a huge garden .
because we' il grow all of our own food , right ?
oh , and she says we' re gonna have horses .
arabian horses like shamire .
yes , yes , yes .
i know i wasn' t a good mother ... ... but like i told the boys , i loved you .
i love all of my children .
i' m gonna make up for it now .
please don' t do this .
i' il raise them like i was raised .
my parents were good christians .
i had a good upbringing .
it' s just that i got a little off track , that' s all .
i' m in a parenting class now .
you' ve only attended once .
well , that' s because i only found out about it in the end ... ... but i' m gonna go to the next session , i swear .
judge marks , this is all a mistake .
i want my kids .
i want to give them a good life .
i' ve always wanted that .
are you prepared to get a job ?
you won' t raise them on welfare .
well , i' m taking it one step at a time .
thank you .
thank you .
will any of the children' s fathers be present here ?
oh , golly , no , no , no .
no , they owe me way too much child support .
i never had a penny .
but i will tell you that these kids were conceived in love .
i understand , but according to the petition signed by your daughter
oh , yes , i read that .
gracie is a good kid , but that' s all she is is a kid .
lf you don' t see me fit to raise the children , they should go to families that' il help them .
no one helped them more than l .
please .
i' ve gone over dozens of reports from social workers .
they' il tell you i' ve been the one that' s been responsible ... ... for feeding and clothing them .
i get them to school .
it has always been me .
you should know that she has sex with a boy in the
that is not the way it went !
he loved me !
yes , it is !
it is the way it is .
and i loved him .
will counsel on both sides please try to get a grip on your clients ?
miss larson .
i' d like to call the children to the courtroom .
let' s .
boys , the judge wants to see you .
come on .
come on , robbie .
ryan walker ... ... jonny blicker ... ... and robbie locascio ... ... you' ve been sworn in , and i' ve explained what that means .
now i' m going to ask each of you a very hard question .
ryan , you' re the eldest , so i' m going to ask you first .
who do you want to live with ?
one , four , three .
i love you , mom .
i will always love you .
i' m sorry , but i would rather live with gracie .
what ?
well , he' s been brainwashed .
wait , wait , wait .
jonny , what about you ?
jonny .
jon , jon , jon .
now , look at me .
miss larson !
look at your mother .
clearly , she has she' s
she' s poisoned them or brainwashed them to be scared of me ...
counsel , i' ve warned you . ... and told them that i am bad .
i' m not bad .
i' m not bad .
i' m just looking for another chance .
one more chance , please , to be their mother .
boys , come to me .
jonny ... ... come to me , my babies .
boys .
boys , i know this is going to be very difficult ... ... but ignore what your mother just said to you .
just try and stay with your feelings .
jonny ... ... who do you want to live with ?
your honor , we' ve been with gracie all our lives .
she feeds us and reads to us ... ... and helps us with our lessons .
she fixes us up when we' re hurt and when we' re scared .
that' s what a mother does , right ?
she changed our diapers when we were babies .
mom , you know that' s true .
robbie ?

but i would like to sleep in my own bed and go home with gracie .
i can take care of it .
i' ve been with this case for some time now .
it seems the children have finally found some stability .
i don' t want to disrupt that .
miss larson , i know you feel pain and remorse ... ... but it' s all coming too late .
