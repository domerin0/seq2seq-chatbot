woe unto man .
brave achilles , slain in trial by blood .
for prize , the bride of menaleas , and father of antigone , ruler of thebes , self rendered sightless by lust for expiation ,
lost victim of bewildered desire .
nor has jason' s wife fared better , giving life , only to reclaim it , in vengeful fury .
for to understand the ways of the heart is to grasp as clearly the malice or ineptitude of the gods .
who in their vain and clumsy labours to create a flawless surrogate have left mankind but dazed and incomplete .
take for instance the case of lenny weinrib , a tale as greek and timeless as fate itself .
lenny , let' s have a baby .
hey .. !
because she' s pregnant , you want to have a baby ?
you could raise your own middleweight .
i don' t want a middleweight .
flyweight .
it' d be fun .
have you ever had children ?
no .
i never ... never had children .
why not ?
why not ?
my first wife didn' t want to have a child , and then i never remarried ...
what am i ?
chopped liver ?
until now .
you didn' t let me finish .
you changed your mind .
you didn' t want to have a child .
you should have kids .
give him a break .
you don' t want a kid ?
when we first met , she didn' t like the beach .
she hated the hamptons .
she didn' t want to have kids .
she loved the upper east side .
suddenly she' s making noise about having a kid and moving to tribeca .
only if the gallery moves downtown .
being pregnant is great .
you get treated like the queen of england .
you say that like it' s a good thing .
well , i love the pampering .
yeah ?
it' s fantastic .
i can' t give up the time .
there are too many exciting things happening in my business .
let me ask you a question .
what ?
how do you plan to swing it without being pregnant ?
that' s a very good question .
it' s easy .
we' il adopt .
oh , well ...
not me .
i don' t want to adopt .
why not ?
no .
that' s a good idea .
no !
you must be nuts .
with my genes ?
to adopt ?
i have award winning genes .
i' m going to pass them on .
that' s crazy .
it' s for the same reason we don' t lease the car .
' cause it' s pride of ownership .
and i don' t want to adopt a child .
sorry , lenny , but it' s crazy , because the world is full of needy kids .
she' s right .
that' s true .
i know , but ... you know ...
no , i mean it .
why overpopulate the world when there are thousands of parentless kids ?
it' s because you don' t want to get morning sickness .
that' s not true .
i just can' t afford to give up a year .
well , forget it .
the subject is closed .
i' d be afraid that i might get a bad seed .
oh , come on .
that' s paranoid .
he' s right .
you read that in the tabloids all the time .
we adopt some sweet little boy , he turns 13 , we go to sleep at night , he' d split our head open with an axe .
why' d you tell him that ?
it' s a common occurrence .
i been to the same payco .
what do you mean , he ?
why can' t we adopt a girl ?
we' re not adopting anything .
let the guy have a shortstop or point guard .
can we get the check ?
i' il take the check .
i' m paying tonight .
yes .
i' m stunned .
you pay , you break your record .
one more and you break dimaggio' s record 56 straight .
now be nice .
laius , proud father , speak !
i with joy did have a son , so fair , so clear headed , and brave , that i a thousand pleasures did derive from his presence .
so what happens ?
one day , he kills me .
and don' t you think , he runs off and marries my wife .
poor oedipus .
king of thebes .
my son , my son did slay unwittingly my noble husband .
and did without realizing hasten with me his loving mother , to lustful bed .
and a whole profession was born , charging sometimes 200 an hour , and a 50 minute hour at that .
and why a child now , out of left field ?
one hopes it' s not to fill some growing void in their marriage .
leave her be .
a woman' s urge to motherhood is old as the earth .
children grow up !
they move out !
sometimes to ridiculous places , like cincinnati .
or boise , idaho .
then you never see them again .
you' d think once in a while they' d pick up a phone .
but is there a growing void in the weinrib' s marriage ?
we didn' t say there was .
we' re all just speculating on possible motives .
children are serious stuff .
look !
here' s a man who killed his father , and slept with his mother .
i hate to tell you what they call my son in harlem .
hello .
there' s a baby we can adopt .
are you serious ?
i spoke to carolyn hester and she' s found an infant for us .
but we have to act quickly .
i don' t want a kid .
lenny , you know how hard it is .
the baby' s one day old , totally healthy .
unwed mother , no diseases .
and it' s a boy !
you wanted a boy .
i can' t get into this with you now .
this is not the place to have this discussion .
i told carolyn to be on the lookout .
she' s experienced with adoption .
it' s a boy .
healthy .
born this morning .
no strings .
if we act quickly .
look , look ...
i gotta put my foot down .
i ...
i ... you know , if you want to discuss this another time , we can .
but if you gotta have a fast answer , it' s definitely no .
got his head ?
he' s adorable .
yes .
oh , god , this is great .
this kid is never gonna be a fighter .
i gotta run out and get some weights .
because he' s really ... he' s light as a feather .
yeah .
perhaps i should have him back .
he' s ...
here , maybe you better hold him .
he' s crying .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
he' s so good .
if there' s any greatness in my hands ,
let it pass into your body .
get a grip on yourself .
this kid is going to be a great kid .
he' s fabulous .
what do you want to call him ?
this is unbelievable .
call him ?
what about eric ?
eric ?
the kid' s not a viking .
i want to call him after one of my heroes .
like what ?
i don' t know .
what about groucho ?
groucho ?
oh , get real .
i' m serious .
it' s a great , you know ...
i don' t know .
what about phineas ?
do you like phineas ?
phineas ?
are you joking ?
yeah , call him phineas .
phineas is the guy who forecloses on the mortgage .
i don' t want to call this kid phineas .
he' s adorable .
that' s so great .
what ... let me think .
what about django ?
django ?
django , yeah .
after django reinhardt , the great guitar ...
django weinrib ?
that' s the curse of the weinrib name .
it doesn' t go with anything .
nothing works with weinrib .
okay , what about something simple , like ben ?
ben ?
you want to call him ben weinrib ?
what' s he going to be , a gin rummy champion ?
you want to deny your heritage ?
you know , i just want the kid to have a great name .
what about sugar ray weinrib ?
holden , after holden caulfield .
holden' s one of those things that works if we use your maiden name , if it' s holden sloan , but not holden weinrib .
the kid is so cute .
i can' t believe this .
what about cole ?
cole weinrib ?
harpo weinrib .
how about earl the pearl weinrib ?
that would be so perfect .
oh , god .
what about shane ?
do you like the name shane ?
yeah , shane' s pretty .
shane would be okay .
on the other hand you wouldn' t want a supreme court justice called shane .
oh , jesus .
i got it !
i got it !
brilliant .
this is so brilliant .
got it ?
ready ?
are you ready ?
thelonius weinrib .
max !
what about max ?
max ?
yeah , max .
look how cute he is .
i want to hold him .
max is okay .
look .
he' s smiling .
doctor max weinrib .
i like the name max .
max is good .
it' s simple .
how about senator max weinrib ?
rabbi max ...
rabbi max weinrib ?
maybe we should rethink max .
he' s happy .
he' s so great .
i think he likes us .
he looks like you .
he looks like me ?
yeah .
he looks like robert crawford a little bit .
he' s so smart .
yeah .
he picks up on everything .
he' s got a great personality .
you wake him up , he' s always smiling .
you were like that when you were a baby .
he' s so verbal .
well , he' s around a writer .
and an art expert , right ?
listen , when are you going to move the gallery downtown ?
we don' t want to get into that discussion ,
' cause , you know , i think we should move and lenny is a devoted upper east sider ...
or shall i say is opposed to change in any form ?
he' s unbelievable .
the kid is unbelievable .
i got him trains .
he put ' em together .
he put the trains together himself .
i thought you bought him an erector set .
i got him an erector set .
and i also got him this tricycle .
and the plastic kitchen ?
i got you a tricycle .
you can' t buy him so much .
i got you a tricycle .
look at that .
you can' t buy him so much .
i also got him skates .
skates ?
yeah , and i got a couple more things on the way ...
a small truck is going to pull up in front of the house .
what are you going to get next year ?
want anything to drink ?
go ahead .
shoot !
try it again .
ever think about what you want to be when you grow up ?
i don' t know .
maybe an interior decorator .
what ? !
just kidding .
just kidding .
don' t kid .
come on .
okay , those go in the bedroom .
you follow me .
give me a hand with this .
why did we move ?
what do you mean why did we move ?
i told you , we moved because ... because ... you know ... your mother wanted to move , because the art gallery she works at has moved downtown and , you know , she wanted to move .
who' s the boss between you and mommy ?
what is the question ?
who' s the boss between you and mommy ?
who' s the boss ?
you have to ask that ?
you don' t know who the boss is ?
no .
i' m the boss , okay ?
mommy' s only the decision maker .
you know , there' s a difference between ...
mommy says what we do , and i have control of the channel changer .
here' s your crayons .
thanks .
we' re new in the neighbourhood .
we want max to be in the best school .
this is it .
because he' s a very very bright kid .
really bright .
yes , i know .
i saw his test scores , and they' re wonderful .
they are .
he' s got a great sense of humour .
he' s a sweet kid .
he' s got a great personality .
i wanted to talk to you about a special program we have for bright students .
really ?
he qualifies ?
oh , yes .
absolutely .
sorry .
this is so great .
when you hear his syntax , it' s amazing .
verbal skills are telling .
his vocabulary' s good , but his syntax ... he speaks like a grown up .
sorry .
lenny .
what we can do ...
sorry .
excuse me .
certainly .
can we meet the dorans tonight for dinner at la cirque ?
no , because we have tickets to the edward albee .
listen , i can' t .
you have to .
we' ve been waiting for so long .
you don' t have to go , but i really should go .
no ...
go with bud .
this is the second time this week we' ve cancelled something .
i don' t want to go with bud .
i' m not married to bud .
can we not discuss it now ?
oh , my god !
that was embarrassing .
just because i don' t want to have dinner yet again with the world' s dullest couple .
someday they may sponsor me for my own gallery .
i said i' m going with you , but we got tickets to a show ...
this time , join in .
don' t sit there like some zombie .
the last time i joined in you got angry .
because we were discussing the i. m. pei museum , not muhammad ali .
my mind wandered .
i can' t keep on those topics .
i just don' t want to be at the bender gallery forever .
i want the amanda sloan gallery .
not amanda weinrib , because there' s a euphony problem .
i hope they don' t play like this .
what' s the matter ?
you seem down .
i' m fine .
fine ?
something' s on your mind .
last night i was at one of those dinner parties again .
amanda , you know , last week she took me to la cirque with the dorians .
last night it was with the grossbads on park avenue .
and then , after that , we were driving home and ...
i don' t know what to say .
it was saturday night , and we stopped for a light over on park avenue .
i looked out the window and i see some guy and this pretty girl .
they' re walking home , and , you know ... and the guy' s carrying the sunday papers .
they looked like they were having so much fun , you know ?
i don' t know .
i remember how great it used to be with me and amanda in our first apartment ... how romantic it was .
ln those days it was just a kick shopping together , you know , just walking the new york streets .
you know , and then when max came , it was ... everything was so great .
we had such terrific times .
i don' t know .
it' s been so long since there' s been ... you know , passion between us .
i don' t know .
but it was the first time i had any of those thoughts .
they made me feel nervous .
you weren' t too pleasant this evening .
why ?
' cause i said no about going to your boss jerry bender' s house in the hamptons ?
i don' t like the hamptons .
you used to hate the beach yourself .
not the way he lives .
it' s private and beautiful .
what are you getting so angry about ?
last time we went i got a tick .
a tick ?
oh , wow .
big deal .
for you it wasn' t a big deal .
everyone will be there .
for the potential contacts i can put up with a few ticks .
it' s like you' re an international spy .
you' ve got contacts all over town .
i plan to have my own gallery !
you' ve changed unbelievably over the years .
oh , yeah ?
you know what ?
people grow .
some people .
it' s not growth .
you used to hate the beach .
and jerry bender has got a crush on you ...
what ? !
that' s nuts .
this guy stares at you and mentally undresses you .
that' s his normal look .
if he looked at me like that i' d hit him with a brick .
or kiss him on the lips .
let' s drop this .
what do you mean , you couldn' t find it ?
i' m sorry .
it' s dark in here , and , you know , we ...
we haven' t done it in a while , and then you got so angry at me .
i wasn' t angry .
you were fumbling and i was getting out of the mood .
sorry i couldn' t find it .
we haven' t been doing it in a while .
i lost my sense of direction .
let' s not get into it .
i' m tired .
every marriage goes through valleys and peaks .
this is like a valley .
i don' t mind going through a valley , but not sinking beneath sea level .
why rock the boat ?
you got a bright , beautiful wife .
you got a kid you' re crazy for .
did i tell you about max ?
they want to put him in a special class because he' s got a high iq .
two bright parents ...
whoever they are .
i still don' t know .
it' s like raising thoroughbreds .
this kid must come from good stock .
he' s good looking .
he' s got a high i. q.
he' s got a great personality and he' s amusing .
this is not my doing .
amanda did the whole adoption .
i just ... resisted .
i complained , like a jerk .
i mean a good father , a dynamite mother produces a kid like max .
i think the father' s dead , but ... .. the mother ...
don' t go any further .
i know what you' re thinking , lenny , and forget it .
how can i forget it ?
the thought' s been put into my head .
oh , cursed fate .
certain thoughts are better left unthunk .
i' il bet this kid has a dynamite mother .
what makes you think he didn' t inherit everything from his father ?
everything ?
that' s very unlikely .
but i' m going to find out .
let sleeping dogs lie !
i' il bet she' s great !
curiosity .
that' s what kills us .
not muggers or all that bullshit about the ozone layer .
it' s our own hearts and minds .
i' m going to find out .
please , lenny , don' t be a schmuck .
i remember the adoption vaguely because i' m somewhat friendly with amanda .
it was not that long ago that we did this .
i recall trying to expedite matters for her .
i somehow think it was a single parent , with no father .
right .
exactly .
so is it possible for me to get the name ?
i' d like the name of the mother , if i could .
that remains forever in our files .
even if i have it , i can' t give it to you .
may i ask why you want to know ?
yes ... because i' m curious about it and i' m trying to get all the information that i can .
so ...
sorry , that' s all i can help you with .
there' s no possibility of ... of ...
no .
those are the rules .
i' m the father of the child .
i can' t find out who the m .. ?
they' re very firm .
it' s never done .
how is the little boy doing ?
good .
he' s great .
he' s fabulous .
say hello to amanda .
there' s no possibility that i could ...
i' m sorry .
really sorry .
no way .
okay .
thank you .
bye bye .
what are you doing , weinrib ?
don' t confuse me .
she' s coming back in a minute .
you are breaking the law .
breaking the law ?
there' s a higher law .
i can find out who my son' s mother is .
a judge won' t see it that way .
keep a lookout for me , for christ' s sake .
me ?
i' m the leader of the chorus .
so what ?
look out !
get your friend bud to help you .
bud can' t help me .
ellie and amanda are friendly .
bud can' t keep a secret .
why is it a secret ?
why can' t amanda know ?
what kind of argument am i getting into ?
because she wouldn' t understand .
you' re guilty because you already have exaggerated notions about your son' s mother .
it' s understandable , because things are not going smoothly ...
that' s why you will always be a chorus member , because you don' t do anything .
i act .
i take action .
i make things happen .
hurry the hell up .
i hear footsteps .
i forgot my ... dropped my manila envelope .
i didn' t realize ...
it has an important interview in it .
with roberto duran .
you won' t believe this , but he' s heading for pennsylvania .
of all human weaknesses , obsession is the most dangerous .
and the silliest .
yeah ?
i' m looking for a former tenant here .
a ... a ...
leslie wright .
who are you ?
i' m a friend of hers , and i believe she lived here at one time .
a leslie wright ?
yeah , i remember a girl that used to live here .
the pretty one upstairs .
she was only here for a while .
who are you ?
just an old friend .
i was trying to track her down .
do you know where i could find her ?
leslie wales was her name .
not leslie wright .
leslie wales ?
she moved to new york .
you sure ?
' cause i have a leslie wright .
did she get married , or ...
i don' t know .
you have no other information ?
where i could find her ?
no .
she was only here for a little while .
let me give you my phone number .
if anything turns up , i would love to locate her .
i' il take that .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
you have a phone call .
mr. lamont .
says he' s from philadelphia .
you gave him your number .
is this lenny weinrib ?
go ahead , sir .
hello ?
this is bill lamont .
that woman you were looking for ... we asked another guy who said her name was leslie st. james .
said she moved to new york city .
talked about becoming an actress .
leslie st. james ?
yes , sir .
he remembered her quite well .
leslie st. james is the name she took .
there was a leslie st. james who was a member of the screen extras guild .
so that' s that .
so what are you telling me ?
that she was a movie extra , or a stage extra ?
that' s all i have .
and there' s an address , but , you know , this book' s a few years old .
so ...
i' m looking for a leslie st. james , or maybe leslie wales .
i don' t know , but i think she lived here .
sure , i remember .
a tall girl .
she changed her name to linda ash .
linda ash ?
yeah .
it was a fake name .
she did sex movies .
sex movies ?
you know , like deep throat ?
skin flicks .
tall .
blonde .
hot .
very hot .
really good looking ?
great looking .
tremendous body .
how ya ' doin ' ?
hey , lenny , how are ya ?
good .
can i talk to you a minute ?
yeah .
i need a favour .
you got it .
what ?
you got friends in the adult film business , right ?
my nephew knows ' em all .
why ?
i' m trying to locate an actress named linda ash .
you know which movie she did ?
no .
i was in the video store , trying to get a video , but i get embarrassed because my neighbour saw me there ...
i hear ya .
let me get back to ya , len .
i don' t know why we have to do this .
i don' t want to spend the whole weekend at jerry bender' s .
please .
we' ve been through this .
there are lots of important clients there .
meanwhile , this guy is going to stare at you the whole weekend and mentally undress you .
he is not .
god , you' re paranoia' s rivalled in history only by joseph stalin .
i' m glad you could make it out this weekend .
there are some people around here you should meet .
thanks , jerry .
i really appreciate it .
i really do .
i love your sailboat .
it' s fun , isn' t it ?
sorry the waves were so choppy , lenny .
it' s no problem .
i don' t mind throwing up into the wind .
you know , we could see that house next door at three o' clock .
it' s a great ...

yeah .

could you show lenny the private phone ?
sure .
it' s right over here .
that house sounds exciting .
what are they asking again ?
why don' t you spend the night here tonight ?
what do you say ?
we could go for a sail .
you can' t believe what the stars look like lying in the back of a boat .
i' d love to .
i really would love to .
then do it .
but i ... he has to get back .
really ?
yeah .
i got the skinny on linda ash .
she' s been in a few films .
she' s no star , or nothin ' .
that' s why you never heard of her .
she works under the stage name judy cum .
mostly , she' s a hooker .
i got her number .
judy cum ?
you never should have looked for her .
now i see big trouble .
oh , for god' s sakes , you' re such a cassandra .
i' m not such a cassandra .
i am cassandra .
that' s who i am .
i gotta check this thing out .
you' il be sorry .
i' m telling you , quit now .

yes .
i see big problems with beach erosion .
and a heavy mortgage .
well , i love that property .

i' m not cheating .
i just want to see ...
you can get a disease .
aren' t you scared of alds ?
i' m not going to sleep with the girl .
i want to see what she looks like , get to know her .

you' re going to rent a hotel room with a hooker and not sleep with her ?
leave me alone .
i want to talk to her .

good .
then you' il like this .

i just got this .
somebody gave it to me .

as the mainspring goes back and forth , the bishop keeps fucking her in the ass .
it' s a genuine antique and it keeps perfect time .
my goodness , it' s disgusting ...
the water today is a little bit brown .
would you like some sprite instead ?
i' m feeling a little dizzy .
oh , no .
come sit down .
i don' t know why .
usually , you know , i' m just the picture of health .
yeah ?

oh , i' m not religious either .
mostly my folks were episcopalian .
oh , are they ?

i wasn' t even in the ball park .
wait , wait .
ball park .
sportswriter .

i don' t care if it' s brown .
i' m sorry .
i don' t mind rust .

paul delucca ?

he' s really well known .
he' s a genius .
i' m sure .
he says he thinks i' m going to make it big .
i know you will .
maybe you' ve seen some of my movies .
it' s possible .
did you ever see the enchanted pussy ?
not yet .
but i ...
i ... it' s on my list .
they' re videotaped , so you could rent it .
but my real ambition is to be on broadway in a musical .
i sing .
do you ?
excuse me .
hello .
is he ?
some of them are called john , all right ?
was that your husband ?
ha ha .
very funny .
but i mean , you have no husband or family ?
no children or anything ?
anything like that ?
' cause some do .
you have a funny look on your face .
did i say the wrong thing ?
no , not really .
i said ...
no !
no !
listen , what are you in the mood for ?
me ?
i would like ... we could chat for a while .
i thought i' d get into it slowly , and , you know ...
you' re married , aren' t you .
how can you tell that ?
' cause you got that look .
that look ?
what look is that ?
that look like it' s been a long time since you had a great blowjob .
oh , that look .
i can understand ...
where are you from ?
around .
what are you so interested in me for ?
that' s my fingers .
yes , i know .
here .
here .
pull !
pull !
pull .. ?
pull the string .
pull these strings ?
pull all the strings .
see what happens ?
i' m not so mechanical ...
it' s easy .
here .
pull .
see ?
it opens .
that' s amazing .
science is ...
oh , really .
you' re a very attractive woman ... a very beautiful young woman .
thank you , honey .
you' re cute , too .
so what do you say ?
you want to go inside ?
take a shower ?
you can study me up close and personal .
oh , no .
see , i' ve bathed already .
you got lipstick on my fi ...
you smell clean .
thank you .
as i say , i' m basically ...
my ear .
you' re sensitive , huh ?
that' s my weak spot , in my ear .
little nibbling .
just makes me ...
okay , lenny .
are you nervous .
i ...
no .
but , yes , i am nervous , to tell you the truth .
i' ve never done this , actually .
that' s all right .
i' il take it slow .
oh , okay .
lncidentally , i think i should tell you ahead of time ,
i get $200 .
that' s no problem .
i just ...
thanks , lenny .
just a show of good faith .
you' re really sweet , len .
put it down as a religious contribution .
no , but seriously , you want to know why i liked you right from the start ?
why ?
' cause i' m always attracted to losers .
losers ?
you think i' m a loser ?
yeah .
you got no confidence .
it' s sweet .
i like that in a man .
i can' t stand those johns who' ve come in here and throw down a couple hundred and whip out a big dick and wave it all over the joint .
i wouldn' t do that even if i wanted to .
shit !
hello .
oh , hello , angela .
oh , god .
thank you for thinking of me .
that' s great .
okay , yeah ...
well , i' il see you at ten .
bye .
i just got a small part in an angela dawson movie .
i get to do it with her .
i don' t understand you .
if you' re serious about being a broadway actress , what are you wasting your time with all this porn for ?
what' s it to you ?
it' s good experience .
making it with a woman in front of the camera is good experience ?
that' s going to get you closer to be a broadway star ?
what are you getting all mad for ?
i' m not mad .
i just think it' s crazy .
you' re an attractive young woman .
you don' t have to live like this .
you take money from guys , and you perform all these acts .
you could be ... hey !
i' m talking to you .
you could have a family .
let go of me .
you could have a husband and a child ....
stop !
stop it now !
now listen , i don' t like possessive men .
you don' t want to do anything with me ...
i want to talk .
do you want to do it or not ?
i paid you , i want to talk .
i bought the time .
you get your money back .
keep the money .
refund .
let' s go .
i bought the time .
stop it .
i' m giving it back and you' re leaving .
why can' t i talk ?
get out !
daddy , why are you staring at me like that ?
come here .
you know why i' m staring at you ?
i' m staring at you because i can' t believe it .
because you' re so bright , and you' re such a great kid ...
come on , max .
it' s time for bed .
come on .
time for beddums .
ready ?
kid' s gettin ' heavy .
he can walk , you know .
can you walk ?
poor weinrib .
turn back !
don' t meddle any further .
accept the truth .
i see disaster .
i see catastrophe .
worse !
i see lawyers .
but wait !
a messenger .
i come from the midtown area , where lenny weinrib tortured by passions too overwhelming to regulate , did indeed call this little hustler on the phone in earnest attempt to see her again .
at first , he wrestled with these drives , trying to master a curiosity not slaked by this initial meeting , but only whetted by it .
his thirst to know this woman more did inexorably provoke him to call her .
nervous and confused , at first he only got her answering machine .
then , at fifth try , she picked up the phone herself .
painful to relate , that she thought he was nuts , and did not want to meet him no how .
stop bothering me , creep ! " was her cutting declaration .
then she used the " f " word .
agonized , he called again , offering her abundant financial compensation just for a brief chat .
but she bade him get off her back and slammed the phone down .
finally , in doldrums mixed with much anxiety , he stood watch outside her apartment , and waited until such a time as he did spot her heading for the laundromat .
oh , my god .
don' t get upset or anything .
i thought we could have lunch .
i' il pay for your time .
i just want to speak to you .
all right !
what are you ?
some kind of fucking pervert ...
leave me alone .
i' m not one of those psychopaths that kills prostitutes .
i promise you .
why would you say that .
i' m joking .
i' m joking .
ln my work , i have to keep an eye out for strange individuals .
i knew a girl that got killed .
i got you some flowers .
here .
let' s have lunch .
i' il pay for it .
i' il pay for your time .
i just want to talk to you .
so then my mother married my third father ...
i don' t know if she married him , but he moved in .
we didn' t get along .
he was a disgusting drunk .
what about your hereditary father ?
your actual , actual ...
oh !
he was a drug pusher .
and he was also a car thief , and he picked pockets .
and , you know , he burgled and stuff , and he was an epileptic .
you haven' t left anything out , right ?
mail fraud !
mail fraud .
that' s what they caught him on .
hey , you got an appetite like a lumberjack here .
oh , well , thank you .
it' s fine .
eat all you want .
i' m very hungry , actually .
so then i ran away when i was 14 .
and i went away with this musician named johnny .
it was terrible , because we fought all the time .
finally , he committed suicide .
and for years i thought it was because of my cooking .
he always hated my clam sauce .
and so then i kicked around from chicago , philadelphia ... .. all over the place , and i ended up here .
you never thought of just getting a regular job ?
well , yeah , sure i did .
i did things .
i waited on tables .
i worked in a massage parlour .
i did phone sex .
now and then i would turn a few tricks to make some dough , and one day my friend suzie calls me and asks me if i want to be in a film , something called snatch happy .
i said sure , and i remember i was very nervous because i' d never done it in front of people with a camera before .
so there i am on the first day , on the set , and there' s this guy fucking me from behind , right ?
and there' s these two huge guys dressed like cops in my mouth at the same time , and i remember thinking to myself ,
i like acting .
i want to study .
yes , well , it' s ... it' s one way of getting into the profession .
tell me about your family a little bit .
i told you already .
you could write a book by now .
but were there any unusual members ?
very bright ones , brilliant , talented ...
yes , i' m sorry .
there was .
my father' s brother was supposed to be a genius .
i never met him , but everybody said he was brilliant .
really ?
what did he do ?
he was a serial rapist .
he spent his whole life in jail .
but if he had gone straight , he might have been very good in math .
i think i got my intelligence from him , because everybody else in the family is all slugs and lowlifes .
i' m the only one with any ambition .
are you ?
and you never had a drive to get married ?
what for ?
they were all assholes .
one of them used to beat me up .
another one used to fuck my best friend when i wasn' t looking .
it was sickening .
really ?
and let me ask you this .
at any point in your life did you ever think , like ... maybe i' d like to have a child ?
i did have a child once .
did you ?
it was a sad story .
i' il tell you some other time when i know you better .
if i ever know you better .
are you free this afternoon ?
do you have some free time this afternoon ?
are you finally in the mood ?
i have an assignment .
i thought you might want to come with me because i think you' il enjoy it .
i' m going to bet on a horse , and if it wins , you can keep the dough .
here' s one .
eager beaver .
i once did a film called beaver patrol about these boy scouts who find drunk girl scouts in the woods .
they take them to a cabin and pull out these dildos ...
all right , okay .
you' re sure you want to bet on eager beaver ?
i know it' s the one .
it' s 60 1 .
it' s a sign .
i know it' s going to work .
famous last words .
i got a hunch .
you got a hunch .
we' il bet on it .
so if he wins , how much do i make ?
at 60 1 you make three thousand dollars .
oh , my god .
i could get that blue chinchilla coat i wanted .
you could get anything you wanted .
a jacuzzi ...
except he' s not gonna win .
i know what i could do !
this is great .
i hope you' re right .
there' s a reason the horse is 60 1 , though .
he' s probably got polio .
no , no .
this is a sign .
my luck is going to change .
is your real name linda ?
i use a lot of names .
my born name is leslie , but i like to use names that have nice meanings , like mary ... for the virgin mary , or angel , or linda , which means pretty in spanish .
but my screen name' s judy cum .
lucky there' s not a horse with that name ...
no , no , no .
my attorney friend would take that under advisement .
i got exclusive rights to that name .
all right , all right .
let me ask you a question .
are you ever frightened that when a guy comes over to your house and pays you that he' s going to tie you up and kill you ?
i always get paid in advance .
come on .
eager beaver .
he' s paying .
honey ...
they' re coming to the finish .
it' s autumn daisy ...
eager beaver continues to drop back .
autumn daisy ...
it' s autumn daisy by a head .
shit !
last !
stupid horse .
damn it .
i had it spent already .
relax , relax .
i mean , relax , will ya ?
it' s not so terrible .
i told you it was a long shot .
i never have any luck .
never !
i never win a fucking thing in my entire life .
stay calm .
you gotta learn to be a graceful loser .
if it' s the money , i' il lend you the money .
it' s not the money .
i don' t care about the money .
i just wanted to win so badly .
what do you want to win for ?
we' re just out here having a good time .
because i wanted to impress you .
impress me ?
you' re not running in the race .
you don' t have to impress me .
but i wanted to show you i could pick a winner .
my horse didn' t win either .
come on .
you do impress me .
you' re attractive .
you' re quick .
you have a lot of energy .
you' re obviously a state of the art philatrix .
what ?
nothing .
i' m impressed .
don' t say " nothing .
you think i' m stupid ?
i don' t think you' re stupid .
i think you' re doing a stupid thing with your life , but i told you that already .
i don' t understand why it matters so much to you .
we' il stay for one more race , and this time i' il bet for you .
let me make the bet .
let' s go to the window .
we' il make one bet .
please don' t pick one that runs second ,
' cause i want a winner .
they give these horses saliva tests .
i can' t guarantee anything .
i gave you your winnings , right ?
yeah .
that was a great race .
too bad the horse only paid 40 cents .
it was a heavy favourite .
i bet him to come in third .
at least you get something .
yeah .
so , you want to come in ?
i gotta go home .
i got a wife and kid .
you only talk about me .
you never talk about yourself .
it' s late for me .
i had a great time , but i gotta go .
i feel i owe you a great fuck .
do me a favour .
go upstairs , rest your ulcer .
stay in tonight .
i can' t stay in .
i got six dates .
slow night for you .
i wish i had the penicillin concession in your apartment .
i' d be wealthy .
so you gonna call me again ?
yeah , i' il call you .
don' t worry .
promise ?
i' il call you again .
okay .
i had a great time .
bye .
congratulations .
thirty five years .
you and amanda have a way to go , but you' il make it .
you guys look so young , both of you .
your mother could be your sister , and you could be brother and ...
i don' t know where that puts me , but anyway ...
she looks so beautiful , doesn' t she ?
to me she always looks beautiful .
and you , when i said sisters before , i mean it .
you guys look so great .
with all the responsibility she has opening her new gallery ...
what new gallery ?
new gallery ?
i didn' t tell you , ' cause i don' t know until ...
did i say the wrong thing ?
no .
i' m just not sure .
it' s 100 percent definite .
you' re so insecure .
it' s happening .
excuse me .
what is the story ?
it looks like i have the backing , but it' s not definite .
your mother said it was definite .
seems i do have the backing , and there' s this wonderful space on vesey street .
down soho .
and it looks like ... we think we can get it .
the dorans are putting in some money .
don' t look so happy about it .
i am happy .
i' m very happy for you .
but it' s the first i' m hearing of it .
and if your mother didn' t tell me ...
i realize that for a time i' m going to be busier than usual .
i know that' s a sore point , but it will be only till it gets off the ground .
i' m happy for you .
you are ?
yes .
i just would have liked to have known .
the amanda sloan gallery .
on vesey street .
believe me , i haven' t even told jerry bender yet .
you' ve got a fine right , you have , after the way you treated mother , after the way you treated us all .
a fine right you' ve got to come back in here in your best country manner and strike attitudes and make stands and criticise my fianc , and give orders , and mess things up generally as if you' ve done ...
i can' t help it !
it' s sickening .
as if he' d done nothing at all !
well ?
what do you think ?
about what ?
about me .
you think i' m any good ?
yes , it' s fine .
i don' t know that much about acting , to tell you the truth .
i can tell you' re not too impressed .
i just thought it' s a very odd part for you to choose .
why ?
because it' s the philadelphia story .
i lived in philadelphia .
what has that got to do with it ?
i know the city .
who care ... ?
you pick a part like this .
you should get something closer to yourself .
it wouldn' t be such a struggle .
what part should i play ?
i don' t know .
something closer .
clint eastwood doesn' t play a meek little hairdresser .
i could play a hairdresser .
i used to do it a lot .
i wanted to be one .
i was very good at it .
why' d you give it up ?
i don' t know .
one thing led to another .
my aunt worked at a beauty parlour for years .
she loved it .
wait .
you mean not be an actress .
an actress is a very tough life .
but a hairdresser can always make a buck .
a buck ?
an honest buck .
no beatings .
no alds .
you can meet somebody ... get a family .
have a real life .
someone that cares for you .
hey !
now don' t you think that i want to meet somebody and get married and get the hell out of the rat race ?
i would like to move away and become a mother and just raise kids .
i don' t want to be a hairdresser .
if clint eastwood wants to , let him .
you miss the point .
clint eastwood doesn' t want to be a hairdresser .
i had a kid , lenny .
and i gave him up for adoption .
it' s the sorriest thing i ever did in my entire life .
there' s not a day that doesn' t go by that i don' t wake up thinking about him .
now some lucky family has him .
i just hope to god that they' re taking good care of him .
why' d you give him up ?
i don' t know .
i was all confused .
i had no dough .
i didn' t know what to do .
i ...
i didn' t even know who the father was .
it could have been any one of a hundred guys .
welcome to planet earth thanks to a broken condom .
that' s tough .
what about your kid ?
max ?
you know , max is the greatest .
yeah ?
sure .
do you have a picture of him ?
a picture of max ?
i' d like to see him .
yeah , i guess i ...
he' s very sweet .
you' re very lucky .
with amanda , it was fate .
with linda , it' s hubris .
his drive to find out , and now , to change her life , to control her .
yes .
danger .
wait .
i see danger .
wait a minute .
i don' t have any interest in controlling her .
i' m doing this for max' s sake .
when the kid gets older , inevitably he' s going to trace his mother .
and i' d be happier if she was married and a hairdresser rather than the star of the enchanted pussy .
danger .
i see horrible , horrible danger .
terrible danger .
i can handle myself emotionally .
not emotional danger .
physical danger .
i see a bald man .
he has a lead pipe .
he' s breaking your knee caps .
so how did jerry bender take it when you said that the decision was final ?
you know what ?
he was amazing .
i thought he' d be upset , but he was very excited and very supportive .
he was absolutely great about it .
anyway , i' m calling to say i can' t make dinner tonight .
you' re kidding .
it' s going to be great .
everybody in the madison square garden organisation is going to be there .
there' s no way i can get away .
the architects are here and the dorans are in town from paris .
and the architects fly back to milan tonight .
i can' t .
i' il tell you what .
i' il go home and put max to sleep .
i' il spend a little time there .
and then ...
look , let me ...
i' m going to call you back .
i got ...
i' m going to call you back .
it' s just against our policy .
i understand .
if you want to wait here .
whatever .
there' s someone here to see you .
come in .
come in .
this is miss gildersleeve .
you know her ?
miss gildersleeve .
we' re old ...
it' s okay .
i' il be in here .
you don' t need anything ?
i' m fine .
what are you doing here ?
lenny , i gotta talk to you .
ricky threatened to hurt me .
who' s ricky ?
he takes a percentage of my work .
he' s a pimp , right ?
no , he' s like a business representative .
what do you need a business rep ...
all you need is a mattress and a couple of garter belts .
you' re not a conglomerate .
he said he was going to cut me up because i told him i didn' t want to work anymore .
it' s a great idea that you want to phase out .
he has no qualms about killing me .
call the police .
that' s not a big deal .
how can i call the police with my set up ?
you know , i told you a thousand times you' re in a hazardous business .
so that' s what happens .
i' m sorry .
don' t go outside .
i' m not going outside .
i thought maybe if you could talk to him .
me ?
what are you , nuts ?
because you' re smart and bright and you got a way with words .
i can' t talk to him .
i don' t even know the guy .
he knows it was your idea that i get out of the business , so he said he' s going to kill you too .
he said he was going to kill me ?
' cause it was your idea , he' s going to cut up my face and put a bullet between your eyes .
really ?
did he specify the calibre ?
listen !
i just thought maybe you could reason with him .
no , i can' t .
i never told you this , but i got a slight heart murmur , and right now it' s murmuring , " hide " .
i don' t believe you' re a coward .
only in actuality .
this is not for me .
i need your help .
i' m not a violent person .
i write about hockey , and boxing and football .
this is not my world .
i want to quit , like you said .
he said he' s not going to let me .
he' s going to hurt us both .
what do you want me to do ?
how am i going to talk to him ?
you just talk , because you' re smarter than he is , and you' re stronger than he is .
you' re a much better man .
remember that .
he' s a little intimidating .
he' s got a bald head and an earring .
but you' il win .
i know you will .
does ...
i don' t ...
you' re a good man .
you' il win .
in case anything comes up ,
i want you to know that i' m type o positive .
okay ?
i got the feeling you came here and moved into this whole knickpersona ...
did you get caught up ....
excuse me .
i' m lenny gildersleeve .
i' m a friend of linda ash' s .
and i thought that perhaps we could ...
what i want to discuss with you is that ... there comes a time in the life of every young woman , not just linda , but everyone , that they want to perhaps make a change in their life .
they maybe want to settle down , or explore alternative lifestyles .
i don' t think you' ve been a very good influence on linda , mr. weinrib .
weinrib .
right .
gildersleeve is a name that i use for business purposes .
i got an investment in linda .
no question .
i honour that .
but by now she' s probably repaid you ten fold or twenty fold ...
don' t be so fuckin ' sure , ' cause you don' t know what the fuckin ' numbers are .
that' s a point well taken .
excuse me , you' re ...
i understand what you' re saying .
is that a peligrino ?
can i ...
because you' ve bent my throat now .
the windpipe used to hang straight .
fucking knicks suck .
they need a good shooting forward .
there' s going to be a three way trade .
seattle , atlanta , and the knicks are talking .
bullshit .
i kid you not .
i know .
it' s in the air .
they' re discussing a trade .
you think the nets got a chance ?
if they' re injury free , i think they have a good chance .
i like the nets .
they' re two years away is all .
i would say two or three , myself .
see ?
we have a common interest , the three of us .
what were we talking about ?
linda ash .
oh , yeah .
that girl' s goin ' no place .
she walks on me i' il disfigure her and i' il fuckin ' kill you .
that' s exactly what dr. kleinholdtz would call acting out .
don' t tell me how to run my business .
my girls do what i tell them .
far be it from me to advise you .
you obviously have a work ethic that' s specific to your needs .
that' s why you can afford an establishment like this .
you' re going to take that from him ?
take it easy .
i' m about to have an out of body experience here .
show strength .
show strength ?
this guy is going to put me into 27 separate mason jars .
the girl was right .
they respect strength .
they despise cowardice .
power is all they know .
stand firm .
remember brave achilles .
achilles only had an achilles heel .
i have a full achilles body .
go on .
look , i' il level with you .
i want to discuss this linda ash thing ...
what are you so interested in linda for anyway ?
are you fuckin ' her ?
it' s a strictly platonic relationship .
if you' re a friend of hers , don' t be putting stupid ideas in her head .
she' s liable to get hurt .
you too .
you going to let him do that to you ?
would you do me a favour and go back to athens ?
you going to let your son' s mother remain a white slave to this two bit pimp ?
it' s starting to look that way .
get the knicks tickets yet ?
no tickets .
i tried everywhere .
do you need tickets to the knicks game ?
why ?
who do you know ?
we want seats on the floor , next to the movie stars .
if you want to discuss a deal with linda i can get you courtside seats .
nobody can get ' em .
i tried .
i can .
i' m a sportswriter .
i can get ' em .
i' d fucking give you my mother for courtside seats , much less this cheap little whore .
perfectly put .
succinctly put .
i know what point you' re making .
if you' re trying to fuckin ' pull something ,
i will shoot you and her through the fuckin ' eyeballs .
silly to haggle over details .
i' il get the tickets .
i promise .
then we can discuss linda .
dad ?
are you very brave ?
am i brave ?
funny you should ask that question .
who' d win a fight , you versus mike tyson ?
what ?
who' d win what ?
who' d win a fight , you versus mike tyson ?
me versus mike tyson ?
who do you think would win ?
you ?
it' d be no contest .
he would probably take the early rounds , but i' d get to him .
i' d chase him all over the ring .
that' s my style .
always was .
i think it will work .
i think it will .
i want the gallery to be lit from above so i guess the skylight will have to be enlarged .
honey , bed ?
could you ?
me or him ?
him .
please ?
no , i' m sorry .
i can' t do this .
i can' t .
why are you fighting this ?
because i' m married , and i have a family .
and i love lenny .
i love him .
who are you trying to convince ?
you or me ?
i got you a present .
you' re kidding .
yeah , for fixing things up with me and ricky .
i know that he can be really rough .
that was completely unnecessary .
very sweet , but completely unnecessary .
you didn' t want a blowjob , so the least i could do was get you a tie .
good thinking .
that' s , uh ... a tie , isn' t it ?
would you ever wear anything that bright ?
if the occasion demanded .
if i ever get invited to the mardi gras .
oh , good .
do you want a sandwich ?
no , i' m fine .
thank you .
it' s great .
good .
you know what , lenny ?
i couldn' t get your son' s picture out of my mind .
he' s a very cute kid .
yeah .
len , i think i would be a good mother .
i think you' d be a great mother .
you' re very affectionate .
i would like to start over again .
maybe have a house .
that would be nice .
it would be great .
i think it would be fabulous .
and you could do it .

i saw her .
she was working late at the gallery .
and with her was this jerry bender guy .

you didn' t let me finish .
go on .
they spoke in intimate tones , and then bender rose and laid a big wet one on her .
big wet ...
bender kissed amanda ?
that' s what i' m tellin ' ya .
you must have known something was going on .
i always thought that bender had eyes for her .
now he' s got eyes and hands .
amanda didn' t respond , did she ?
no .
she just opened her mouth very wide and stuck her tongue out as far as humanly possible .
are you sure ?
hey , did the trojan horse have a wooden dick ?
and then she pushed her abdomen against his .
all right , all right .
i got the picture .
i knew it .
i always suspected .
something you don' t want to know , but you had to be blind not to see it .
god .
i' m gonna confront her .
not in front of max .
max has got a sleepover date at his friend' s house .
i knew it .
down deep i knew it .
thanks , weinrib .
thanks .
thank you .
god bless you .
oh my god .
it' s more serious than we thought .
it' s very serious .
her marriage to lenny is in crisis .
with the passage of time , even the strongest bonds become fragile .
great , fellas .
it sounds like a fortune cookie .
oh , zeus , most potent of gods , we implore thee , we need your help .
zeus , great zeus , hear us .
we call out to thee .
um , this is zeus .
i' m not home right now , but you can leave a message and i' ilget back to you .
please start speaking at the tone .
call us when you get in .
we need help .
god , i think i should move out .
i can' t understand this .
it' s so radical .
no , ' cause i can' t cheat .
jerry bender' s in love with me .
and what do you tell me ?
that you' re in love with him ?
i don' t know .
i gotta find out .
what do you mean you don' t know ?
i don' t know .
what do you mean you don' t know ?
are you in love with him or not ?
face it , things have changed between us .
we can fix things .
and what about max ?
he' il be okay .
maybe it will be better for him with us apart instead of together and arguing all the time .
that' s crazy .
i just think that' s crazy .
i can' t have this conversation .
it' s just too crazy .
where are you going ?
i' m going out .
i have to get my thoughts together .
i been waitin ' for you , man .
leave me alone .
i' m in a very bad mood .
how could you do this to me ?
how could you set me up with this stupid girl ?
what are you talking about ?
you didn' t tell me she was a hooker , and did porno films and had sex with hundreds and hundreds of men and women and who knows what else .
i thought it would prejudice you .
what ?
how did you find out ?
i call my friends up and tell them i got this girl i want to marry .
they have me over for drinks and my friend puts in this sexy video , but i' m not into pornography .
i look up on the screen and this actress is up there , judy cum .
i told you she had dramatic aspirations .
i flew off the handle .
i thought you were broad minded .
i came over here and she confessed to everything .
and i hit her .
you hit her ?
i was going to break your neck .
i don' t believe this .
i don' t believe this .
you hit her ?
a little bit .
god .
i called my mother .
i was upset .
she says i should come home .
i don' t understand you .
you' re a broadminded guy .
people change .
you going to hold her past against her ?
she' s a porn star !
you love her .
she loves you .
forget it , man .
it' s over , man .
i told you from day one the girl was not a virgin .
you didn' t tell me how many times , though .
thanks for nothin ' , lenny .
nah , man .
he hit me .
i know .
i ran into him downstairs and he ...
oh , jesus .
look at you .
god .
does it feel terrible ?
no , not really .
just my ulcer .
your ulcer .
you shouldn' t be drinking .
that' s the worst ...
oh , god , look at that .
remember you once said we were a couple of losers ?
yeah .
i think that' s definitely true .
why ?
what happened to you ?
amanda left me .
oh , i' m sorry , lenny .
would you like a drink ?
no .
what' s the matter ?
i don' t know .
was she great ?
you can tell me .
was she great in bed ?
i mean , a woman with all that experience .
i don' t know .
i just know that suddenly i really miss amanda .
but wait !
see who approaches .
there you are .
where have you been ?
i' ve been looking for you all over .
i was just out drinking and thinking about everything .
oh , lenny , i' m sorry .
i was up all night thinking how much i hurt you , and how much i messed us up for good .
and the thought of not being with you ...
i love you .
i don' t love jerry at all .
we have to put things right .
whatever has to be done .
when you' re alone the magic moonlight dies
at break ofdawn there is no sunrise
and as for linda , she drove upstate to wompsville and pleaded with kevin to take her back , but to no avail .
anyway , on the way home she was distraught , and felt life held no hope , when , talk about a deus ex machina ...
like faded flowers life can' t mean anything
when your lover has gone
so we just had a stabilizing problem and the thing got off balance and the radio went glitchy , so i needed to get down to use a phone .
thank you very much , by the way , for stopping .
my name' s don .
and so linda married .
and to a wonderful man who was not uptight and repressed and accepted her , and even laughed at wild tales of her promiscuous background .
and so our little greek drama comes ...
wait , wait .
there' s more .
what more , tiresias , blind seer of thebes .
tell them just to call me tiresias , will ya ?
the handicapped are always cranky .
on that night , lenny weinrib and linda did make love ,
like he was zeus and she was aphrodite with an aphrodisiac .
get to the point .
the point is linda did that night conceive a child .
she became pregnant with lenny' s child , but not wanting to complicate his life with amanda ,
she never told him .
lnstead she went off with her new husband who stood behind her loyally as she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl .
lenny never saw linda again , and then , one fall day in new york ...
i think they' re probably in the back there .
we can look through the whole store if you like ...
i don' t believe this .
what are you doing here ?
i' m stunned .
what happened to you ?
i' m living in connecticut .
i' m married , and my husband don is a helicopter pilot .
you' re kidding ?
where did you go ?
i searched everyplace .
it' s like you vanished off the face of the earth .
we had our moment , but i knew you would be back with amanda .
i can' t ...
that' s so great .
so you' re married , and this is yours ?
yes !
look at her .
she' s adorable .
very , very ...
this is max .
is that max ?
max , say hello .
this is a friend .
hi , i' m linda .
how do you do ?
what a handsome boy .
amanda must be very beautiful .
and you' ve gotta have a very handsome husband .
she has a great face .
i' m stunned .
i don' t know what to say .
lenny , it' s so great to see you .
you too .
you' re okay , everything ?
i' m really good .
thank you for everything .
i gotta go .
i' m sorry .
i' m going to be late .
it was great to see you .
it was great to see you .
great .
but they have each other' s child .
and they don' t know .
yes , yes . lsn' t life ironic ?
life is unbelievable ... miraculous , sad , wonderful .
yes , this is all true .
