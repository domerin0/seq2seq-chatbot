more like a civilian trapped in a cop' s body .
oh .
well , i hear you can get an operation for that .
but then , i guess you' d miss out on all those wacky things you highway guys do .
yeah , those stories about us are mostly lies , really .
except for the one about how we pulled over ac/ dc' s bus ... and then they flew us down to jamaica to party with them ; that one' s true .
but , yeah , other than that , it' s pretty boring out there .
yeah , well , i wouldn' t know .

john chimpo , i' m told .

farva , you' re ridin ' with thorny .
wait a minute  what do you want me to do about it ?
my hands are tied !
it' s all over the police band !
rabbit , you couldn' t have picked a worst time !
i got a q 17 request form today .
we have to inventory our equipment .
which means our balls are this close to the band saw .
what are you sellin ' , mac , hot dogs ?
there' s a new billboard .
casino le fantastique ?
let me guess .
you just humped the mayor' s wife and burnt down city hall .
i' il do you one better , captain .
so i' m walkin ' down by the local police station , minding my own business .
but there' s something funny in the air .
i feel like i just gotta get into that winnebago .
so after i jimmy the door , i do a quick recon .
bullshit .
i can see there' s something not right about that bed .
so i busted it in .
bullshit .
and just sittin ' there were ten huge duffel bags of these mothers .
let me get this straight .
you went into the impound , scaled the fence ... broke into the winnebago and smashed the bed , all on a hunch ?
i' il believe that when me shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbet .
what ?
do you think i just grew this weed ?
how could you know to look underneath the bed ?
it must have been my sixth or even my seventh sense .
you know , rabbit , a good cop doesn' t really know why he does anything .
disregard that , rabbit .
and you didn' t even think to call in your partner ?
so these local mothers have got a hundred keys of chiba and don' t know it ?
not a clue .
it' s totally hidden .
and grady' s walkin ' around like he' s hot soup .
all right , we got a chance here .
but we got to beat these guys to the punch .
mac , you and foster check out the truck stops ... and find out what you can about galikanokus and bunty soap .
i' il talk to grady and play a little hardball .
thorny , i' m takin ' a hard line .
you got to promise me no more bullshit .
cap , you know i' m cool , but i can take no responsibility for these white devils .
well , you' re gonna have to .
now , rodney , we' re under a lot of pressure here .
remember what we talked about .
if anything happens ... count to ten , take some deep breaths .
ten deep breaths .
i got it , cap .
foster , you re on duty .
trust me , skipper , we' il make you proud .
you are awesome .
you are incredible .
you are a fantastic cop .
keep goin ' .
uh , and then somebody said , i think it was o' hagan , said , um ...
" foster , you deserve a promotion .
hmm .
i think you get a star .
mm .
foster ?
wait .
i don' t know if this is gonna work .
this steering wheel is jabbing my ass .
oh , right .

yeah ?
oh .
foster ?
yeah ?
in our cruisers , somebody has to let you out of the back seat .
oh , fuck it !
do we look like the two dumbest guys in the world to you ?
is that why you choose to treat us with such disrespect ?
look , all i' m sayin ' , man , is switch partners .
it' il be fun .
i don' t think so .
come on , mix it up a bit .
mm , no fuckin ' way .

look , you' re fuckin ' super cop .
you should know this .
i am super .
plus , we can' t take our car ... until they replace the door you , for no reason whatsoever , removed last night .
i told you it was those kids with the wrenches .
ah , yes , those ballsy little punks who took your car door off ... while you were sittin ' in the damn thing .
i told you i was in a very deep sleep .
yeah .

maybe we can borrow his car today .
do you even know how to drive this thing ?
shit !
this rig sucks !
aha !
uh , who knew it was a stick ?
how about we , uh , pop a couple of viagra ... and issue tickets with raging , mega huge boners ?

nuh uh .
i' m back on the road , now .
until this little incident .
listen , rod .
this whole murder thing , we' ve been tryin ' real hard to break it open ... but o' hagan just will not cooperate with the evidence .
now i' ve spoken to the governor myself .
she is gonna shut your station down , son .
it' s gonna happen .
now , i' m gonna have a bigger budget then , and i could really use ... a good local officer like yourself .
could i go now ?
you could have your own car .
work on exciting cases .
hey , we could even chase drug dealers together .
now , the thing is , rod ...
i really need to know about your side of the investigation .
o' hagan' s making all kinds of threats , and
can we make a deal ?
i' m all highway .
let him loose .
sorry about that , bro .
hey , charlie' s angel .
what' s up ?
guys .
hey .
well , we got about , uh , twenty desk lamps .
farva went schizoid .
that' s good .
how did the undercover thing go ?
well , not so good .
turns out , this guy can' t drive a semi .
yeah .
you guys watch that johnny chimpo thing ?
funny , but nothin ' there .
mm .
maybe you missed something .
mm , trust me , bro .
there' s nothing there .
maybe we should take another look .
that' s it , you' re off the road .
never again .
sir , no .
it was not my fault .
neither was the goddamn school bus .
you know , there was a time we' d take a guy like you out back and beat you .
now you got your goddamn unions .
i' m not a pro union guy .
and you' re banned from dimpus burger .
damn it !
get some rubber gloves .
from now on , you' re my cleaning lady .
beat it !
well , the butler is basically saying to johannes chimpo ...
don' t let the great satan tempt you with the western culture .
you must remain true to the taliban warlord .
cool beans .
so , um , galikanokus is not the butler ?
well , possibly .
but this is , uh , quite brilliant , really .
and so , captain , you think there might be some connection with the smugglers ?
rabbit , get this meatball out of here .
you got it , captain .
come on , meatball .
we should probably do that .
back in the cage with your beautiful wife , huh ?
what did you find out at the weigh station ?
my cruiser weighs 16, 000 kg .
i just got off the phone with tom mccardle from the budget committee .
this thing with farva screwed our pooch .
what ?
they can' t lump us in with that fuckin ' martian .
we' re all in the same boat .
but our shenanigans are cheeky and fun .
yeah .
his shenanigans are cruel and tragic .
which makes them not shenanigans at all , really .
evil shenanigans .
i swear to god i' il pistol whip the next guy that says , " shenanigans .
hey , farva !
what' s the name of that restaurant you like , with all the goofy shit on the walls ...
and the mozzarella sticks ?
you mean shenanigans ?
no !

the mayor came down today .
ah , biker !
i' m an idiot .
boy , you guys just keep shooting yourselves in the foot .
heard you got to see farva naked .
yeah , it was hard to miss .
so , grady thinks he' s got you guys by the balls .
yeah .
how do you feel about long distance relationships ?
think i' m getting sent to deer lick .
well , i' ve been thinking about this .
i think i might have an idea .
the governor comes to town on saturday for that big thing , right ?
she' s gonna make a big speech about drugs and law enforcement ...
and all of that because of your bust .
she' s gonna shut us down .
no !
not if you give her more .
get the reefer out of the winnebago and give it to her during the party .
make a big show of it .
with all that media there , she would love us for it .
no way she' il shut you down .
that reefer' s locked in the winnebago ... which is locked in your impound , which is guarded by assholes .
all right .
here' s what i' il need .
five ski masks , a case of smoke bombs the good ones
and banana peels , lots of banana  foster ?
how about if i just help you get in ?
you would do that for me ?
yeah .
what the hell .
we' il work together .
like cagney and lacey .
yeah .
well , cagney and lacey were women .
but  i could be lacey .
mac o !
so that' s it , huh ?
c. c. s. rockman bulletproofing is the tops !
same guys who make our flak jackets .
now , rabbit , a good cop does what ... before using his equipment in the field ?
uh , they test it ?
they test it .
exactly .
how are you shootin ' today , thorn ?
dead on all morning .
how about that little fella ?
oh , that little guy ?
i wouldn' t worry about that little guy .
good enough for me .
you' re my man , now .
i don' t get it .
how are we going to get into the local impound ?
there are gonna be cops there .
wa hoo !
most of the local cops will probably already be at the banquet .
they' il leave , like , one or two of the dumbest guys at the station .
how are you feelin ' there , mac ?
good enough to fuck your mother !
so , what we have to do is distract whoever they leave there .
hey , mac !
you still have that halloween costume ?
oh , hell , yeah .
you don' t throw out
wa hoo hoo !
damn , that' s good !
so , if we can get ten minutes , you and i can get into the impound ... get the reefer , and get it to the governor before she leaves ?
nice and easy .
i like it .
you' re up .
me ?
now , don' t get puke on it .

maybe not to the untrained eye .
but if i was a bettin ' man , i' d put money on us changin ' the governor' s mind tonight .
well , you might want to strap on your ass kissing boots and start right now .

humane society ?
uh , it' s a drug bust .
cocaine ?
hello .
uh , marijuana .

i don' t envy her .

i' il be lucky to have a figure like that when i' m her age .
yeah .

due to our tight fiscal situation ...
we regret to inform you that we are still ...
going to have to close your station .
