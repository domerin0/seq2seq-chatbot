sunday , september 5
a grade school boy took a trip to lzu with his family , and they stayed in a cabin .
he wanted to go out and play ... but there was a tv show he didn' t want to miss .
so he recorded it on the vcr in their room .
but the channels down there are different from tokyo' s .
no station there uses that channel , so nothing should' ve been recorded .
you will die in one week .
the kid stopped the tape , and then the phone rang .
you saw it .
and the kid died a week later !
what' s wrong , tomoko ?
who told you that story ?
everybody' s talking about it .
was it yoko ?
no , not her .
what ?
i saw a weird video the other day .
where ?
with yoko and the others . is it true that you all went on a trip somewhere ?
nothing happened !
but that night ...
lwata found this weird video , and we all watched it .
what was it like ?
it' s hard to say .
as soon as it ended , the phone rang .
but nobody was there .
scary .
everyone else had heard that story .
today will be one week .
come on !
you' re just trying to scare me !
how did you know ?
i can' t believe it !
you' re so easy to fool .
but did you really spend the night there with lwata ?
so what happened ?
i' m not telling !
confess ! it' s a secret .
it was true , wasn' t it ?
masami !
masami !
hello ?
hold on a sec .
hello ?
it s you , mom !
a friend came over .
okay .
got it .
all right , all right .
extra innings .
they' il be late .
my parents shouldn' t have scared me like that !
look who' s talking .
i' m going to tell everyone tomorrow .
i m going to the bathroom .
don' t go upstairs without me .
sure .
on the mound , takasu , the third player ....
everyone' s talking about this deadly video ....
yes .
have you heard what' s on it ?
yes .
don' t look at the camera .
sorry .
one more time .
have you heard what the video is like ?
i heard that suddenly there' s this scary woman ... who says , " you will die in one week .
they say she appears when you watch late night shows on tv .
and then the phone rings .
late night shows on tv ?
what channel ?
i heard it was on a local channel down in lzu .
lzu ?
yeah .
and is there really anyone who died a week later ?
no one that we know .
well ....
what ?
a high school student i know told me ... a girl who watched it died in a car on a date with her boyfriend .
an accident ?
no .
they were found dead in a parked car .
he watched the video , too . it was in the paper a few days ago .
do you know which high school she went to ?
no .
my friend heard it from a friend of hers .
ms. asakawa .
yes ?
here .
thanks .
about ten years ago ... a star killed herself , and people saw her ghost on tv .
yeah , but this time everyone mentions the lzu peninsula for some reason .
well , maybe that' s where this one started .
where did the story start about the woman with torn lips ?
i think it was gifu .
there was a big traffic accident there and that' s how it started .
a big accident ?
these stories get started when people die horrible deaths .
did something happen in lzu then ?
i don' t know .
well , i have to go .
good night .
good night .
young couple found dead in car
a 19 year old tokyo boy and a 1 7 year old yokohama girl ... were found dead in a car on the morning of sept .
6
take care of it , okay ?
i thought you were leaving early today .
okazaki , will you do something for me ?
sure .
can you find out which high school she went to ?
no problem .
call me when you find it .
okay .
yoichi !
sorry i m late .
you changed already !
i got your clothes ready , too .
thanks .
we need to hurry .
did grandpa call ?
no .
how come tomoko died ?
probably some disease .
zip me up .
do young people die , too ?
sometimes they get sick .
but don' t talk about that at aunt yoshiki' s , okay ? it s too painful for her .
yeah .
tomoko used to play with you , didn' t she ?
dad .
how' s sister ?
she' s lying down .
better leave her alone .
i' il go help .
yoichi , you come sit here .
excuse me .
reiko .
does anyone know how tomoko died ?
no , i don' t .
but the police did an autopsy !
but there was no evidence of a crime .
people don' t just die like that .
and they never opened the coffin .
isn' t that strange ?
yoichi .
don' t play in this room .
let' s go downstairs .
okay .
go ahead .
okay .
hello ?
it' s okazaki .
i found the name of the high school .
seikei girls ' school in yokohama .
thank you .
in loving memory seikei girls ' school
yoko died , too .
yeah , and lwata , too ....
sorry to interrupt .
was the girl who died in the car a friend of yours , too ?
lf there' s anything you know ....
all of them died on the same day .
yoko and tomoko .
and lwata had a motorcycle accident .
they saw the video .
the video ?
yoko told us they' d all seen this weird video .
when it was over , they got a phone call .
tomoko saw it , too ?
where ?
they all went and spent the night somewhere .
a girl was with tomoko when she died .
she went insane and was hospitalized .
she never goes anywhere where there' s a tv .
the girl was tsuji yoko , 1 7 , a senior at seikei girls ' school .
the boy was nomi tadahiko , 19 , a junior college student .
the car doors were locked .
i' ve never seen a corpse look like that .
cause of death ?
unknown .
their hearts simply stopped .
drugs ?
nothing in the autopsy .
they went up there to make out , then they suddenly died .
it doesn' t make any sense .
i heard that yoichi came to the funeral .
yes .
he used to go upstairs and play in tomoko' s room .
he did .

i il check who stayed there , and if there were any pirate broadcasts .
wednesday , september 15
from the lzu bureau .
thanks !
what are you going to do with the cabin registry ?
sorry , but i just need to check something by myself .
was it you ?
did you do this ?
sorry i m late .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
so , do you have any new information ?
no one i phoned brought a tape to the cabin .
and they all sounded normal , not like they' d make a tape like this .
how about pirate stations ?
there' s no record of an illegal broadcast anywhere in lzu .
here' s the copy .
asakawa .
have you ever seen this woman ?
no .
this shot is strange .
from that angle , the cameraman should be in the mirror .
what do you mean ?
i don' t know .
you could fix it with special effects , but ....
eruption .
which eruption ?
you can' t read it on a regular home tv .
come in .
this is takano .
one of my students .
asakawa .
my ex wife .
how do you do ?
i m takano .
i m asakawa .
the publisher wants your essay .
why did they tell you that ?
because they couldn' t reach you .
ask for a week extension .
me ?
ask them yourself !
okay , okay .
not clear enough .
sada .
is yoichi all right alone ?
he' s used to it .
whoever made this video left a clue subconsciously .
the person wants to be found out .
wait .
frolic in brine , goblins be thine . " it sounded like that .
what does it mean ?
i il check tomorrow .
... who says , " you will die in one week .
they say she appears when you watch late night shows on tv .
and then the phone rings .
thursday , september 16
late night shows on tv ?
what channel ?
i heard it was on a local channel down in izu .
izu ?
yeah .
hello ?
i found it .
like i thought , it' s a dialect .
it' s about brine and goblins .
a dialect ?
from where ?
oshima island , where there' s a volcano , mt .
miharayama .
hello , yoichi ?
i il be late tonight .
yeah .
are you okay alone ?
i m sorry .
this is it , but it happened a long time ago .
mt .
miharayama eruption alert to local residents
did local woman predict eruption ?
what is it ?
does the paper have a bureau in oshima ?
i think there' s a correspondent there .
get me the number .
tonight .
why ?
you only have four days left .
i il handle it with your correspondent .
please stay with yoichi .
grandpa !
welcome !
friday , september 1 7
yoichi wants to go fishing with you .
really ?
c' mon , let' s go !
let' s get ready and go fishing !
yeah !
right there .
now that way !
grandpa !
you' ve got one !
we missed it !
you' re not very good at this !
okay , let' s try it again .
let' s fish over here this time .
all right .
you' re home .
hello ?
the correspondent in oshima did some research for us .
the woman who predicted the eruption is probably the one in the video .
her name was yamamura shizuko .
she threw herself into the volcano 40 years ago .
what do we do now ?
i' il go down there .
i' il go to oshima tomorrow .
oshima ?
but i only have three days left !
i know .
and i have four .
i' il call later .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
just doing my work .
auntie .
yoichi ?
yoichi !
did you bring this ?
how dare you ?
why ?
tomoko ....
tomoko told me to watch it .
i was careless .
i sensed something when i visited your house .
but i thought it was the video . it was tomoko .
she' s not tomoko anymore .
can yoichi see her , too ?
it s all my fault , isn' t it ?
it should have ended with tomoko and her friends .
i don' t know .
where did this story come from ?
nobody starts these kind of stories .
whatever people feel anxious about becomes rumor and starts to spread .
anxious ?
or people start them , hoping things will turn out like this .
mr. hayatsu ?
hello .
sorry you had to come all the way out here .
this way .
saturday , september 18
the yamamuras in sashikiji used to run a big fishery .
but they sold most of their business .
shizuko' s cousin is still alive .
his son and daughter in law run an inn .
i ve booked you there for tonight .
why did yamamura shizuko commit suicide ?
i heard she went insane .
the papers had written awful things about her .
she became famous all over the island after her prediction of the eruption .
she had strange powers all her life .
she was what they call a seer .
after that , a professor showed up .
you' ve heard of him . lkuma heihachiro .
wasn' t he fired ?
he brought shizuko to tokyo and experimented on her .
he was trying to prove the existence of esp .
the papers praised him , then trashed him .
it was 40 years ago , and the media still does the same thing .
i ve heard this story .
lf i m not mistaken , didn' t someone die in the experiment ?
dr. lkuma disappeared after his university fired him .
i doubt he' s still alive .
even if we found him , what could we do ?
they say shizuko had a daughter .
hello ?
hello .
welcome .
i il leave you here .
please come in .
how many rooms ?
two , please .
yes , sir .
this way , please .
sir ?
please .
wait !
please tell me about shizuko !
there' s nothing to say .
what about her daughter ?
she didn' t have a daughter .
not eating ?
no .
when i die , stay with me .
cut it out .
please !
please ?
and try to find a way to save yoichi !
stop it !
the girl who was with tomoko lost her mind , huh ?
i don' t know what' il happen to me .
you' il be all right !
because i m not normal ?
maybe all three of us should just die .
good idea !
we shouldn' t have had a kid in the first place .
stop it !
we still have two days left .
excuse me .
come in .
did you want to know about shizuko ?
this is all that' s left .
is this dr. lkuma ?
yes . it was before i came here .
good night .
thank you .
frolic in brine ... goblins be thine .
sunday , september 19
you' d better leave this town .
there' s a storm coming tonight .
what was shizuko like ?
she was a strange one .
she used to sit here all day long .
she' d just stare at the sea every single day .
all the fishermen hated her .
the sea is ominous for us .
every year some of us die in the sea .
but she just kept staring at it
frolic in brine , goblins be thine .
lf you play in the sea , the goblins come to get you .
shizuko was able to read people' s minds , wasn' t she ?
she must have known about things which people hid deep inside their minds .
that must have been painful .
go home !
i have similar abilities .
you were the one who spread a rumor about shizuko' s abilities , weren' t you ?
you also called dr. lkuma .
nonsense !
you thought you could make money off of shizuko .
you earned money from the newspapers , too .
that' s enough !
tell me about her daughter !
what happened to her ?
i don' t know !
she should have been with shizuko !
esp public demonstration
you were there ...
when shizuko gave her demonstration .
correct .
correct .
correct .
correct .
correct .
this is a fraud !
this is just a magic show !
you can' t fool me !
dr. lkuma , she' s deceiving you , too !
hey !
what' s wrong ?
he' s dead .
she' s a monster !
sadako !
did you do that ?
sadako ?
sada
sadako killed him ?
she could kill someone just by wishing ?
she was a monster !
sadako !
hey !
yes !
after shizuko killed herself , dr. lkuma took sadako with him .
but nobody knows what happened to them since .
find them !
dr. lkuma may be dead , but sadako should be in her 40s .
i il explain later .
hurry !
i doubt sadako is alive , either .
she killed a man just by wishing his death .
her power was much stronger than her mother' s .
then that video .... it s not from this world .
it s sadako' s wrath .
she' s put a curse on us .
all the ferries have been canceled because the typhoon' s too close .
try a fishing boat .
we' il pay .
a fishing boat ?
the typhoon might change course .
you' d better wait .
okay , then i il find one !
mr. takayama !
mr. takayama !
hello ?
ms. asakawa ?
i' m sorry , but there' s no trace of either of them .
hello ?
thank you .
yoichi !
lzu !
ryuji !
ryuji .
the phone didn' t ring at my house .
the only place it rang was at that cabin !
dr. lkuma must' ve ....
but we' re stuck here .
you can' t take a boat out on a night like this !
let me handle this .
sadako' s calling you , isn' t she ?
or maybe she' s planning to drag us into the sea .
take us !
it s strange , isn' t it ?
i m not afraid at all .
sadako probably died there , before that cabin was built .
was sadako dr. lkuma' s daughter ?
he had a wife and family .
his affair with shizuko caused a scandal .
that was another reason for his dismissal .
let' s find sadako' s corpse .
will that lift the curse ?
will that save yoichi ?
there' s nothing else we can do .
i have one day left .
i guess sadako doesn' t hate you .
shizuko used to talk to the sea .
she mumbled things to it .
she looked like she was having fun .
i hid once and listened .
but it wasn' t a human language .
monday , september 20
hello ?
yoichi ?
it s mom .
i m coming back tomorrow .
i' m bored here .
i want to go back to school !
don' t say that !
you' il hurt grandpa' s feelings !
he' s laughing .
do you want to talk to him ?
that' s okay .
i m sorry .
i il hurry home .
what' s wrong ?
i still have something to do .
say hello to grandpa for me .
what time did you watch the video ? it was 7 or 8 minutes after 7 : 00 p . m . , but it was before 7 : 10 for sure .
lf the story' s true , that will be your deadline .
here .
a well , just as i thought !
a well ?
her father ?
dr. lkuma put this lid on .
sadako' s under here .
i il go down .
sadako was still alive !
she tried to climb up .
lower the buckets !
pull it up !
pull it up !
pull it up !
it s 6 : 00 p . m . already !
i know !
hurry and take it up !
pull it up !
asakawa !
damn it !
are you trying to kill me ?
hey !
asakawa !
let' s switch .
you can' t lift anymore .
no !
then who' s going to lift the buckets up ?
we don' t even know if it' il save us !
then what about yoichi ?
you have to pick him up tomorrow !
don' t look down !
where are you ?
come out !
please !
where are you ?
it s you .
hey !
asakawa ! it s past 7 : 10 !
we' re saved !
why did he kill his own daughter ?
maybe she wasn' t his daughter .
i wonder if her father was even human .
the marks are gone .
it s over .
i il take you home .
get some rest .
i ve got a deadline for my essay .
thank you .
idiot !
tuesday , september 21
why ?
now i got it !
asakawa !
are you a resident ?
i m takayama ryuji' s wife !
the body' s been taken away , ma' am .
what happened ?
when i got there , he was lying on the floor .
did he say anything to you ?
about a video ?
his face ....
why , ryuji ?
will yoichi die , too ?
didn' t we lift the curse ?
why was i the only one saved ?
sadako' s curse was only lifted from me .
why not you , ryuji ?
what did i do that you didn' t ?
what did i do that you didn' t ?
ryuji ?
something i did that you didn' t ... to lift the curse .
i copied it ... and showed it to you !
dad ?
yeah , i m on my way .
i have a favor to ask you . it s for yoichi .
i heard that there' s a way to lift the curse from the video .
you have to copy it and show it to someone else within a week .
then what happens to them ?
they have to do the same thing within a week .
then it never ends ?
that' s right .
it goes on forever .
but if you don' t want to die , you' d do it , wouldn' t you ?
