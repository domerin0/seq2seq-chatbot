25 . 000
oh , no !
we' re trying to play football here , mate .
my lord , the green is ready !
the prince of bowls ... is on the green .
good morning , mr speight .
good morning , mr speight .
morning , ray .
may i ?
you' re rushing the release .
in bowls , the key is composure .
yeah !
just for daddy !
oh , my lord !
on the condom ?
it is on the condom !
come on !
the jack .
your wood , my wood .
if mine finishes closer to the jack than yours , i score one shot .
simplicity itself .
and bowls , bridget , is all about simplicity .
the three " a" s .
approach ...
assess ...
aim .
the three " b" s .
bend ...
balance ...
breathe .
finally , the three " t" s .
target ...
tempo ...
tosser !
who said that ?
saluting a fellow sportsman .
brothers ... of the black ball .
i mean , my god !
my god , the embarrassment !
we' il never hear the last of it .
that' s a great shot , that' s a beauty !
people know we' re related .
i know .
i wish you' d stop going in that club .
no , for me it' s embarrassing !
that' s the owner .
you did finish that bedroom ?
before you went bowling ?
yeah .
is this where we ripped it and you said , " let' s play fuckin ' bowls " ?
watch and learn , mate .
trick of the trade , right ?
if you tear the paper , you cut out bits of the pattern and stick it on the join .
see ?
do you not think there' s other things she' il worry about ?
it' s all evenly spaced up here .
down here it' s the fuckin ' milky way .
and in the bedroom ...
we' re coming along nicely .
all right , my love ?
done something a bit special for you over here .
i took the liberty of doing a bit of research , and i discovered the position of the stars on the night you were born .
what we' ve got here is the constellation of ormelius , the long straight snake .
the chinese believe this will have governed your career as a ... ?
professor of astronomy at exeter university .
bollocks .
i don' t understand why somebody who can place a wood perfectly , 30 yards away , can' t even hang wallpaper .
it' s a different skill .
wallpapering requires a different set of skills .
what are you doing ?
i do the heavy stuff .
grandad , he looks after the wallpapering , and i look after grandad .
deal ?
deal .
you' re a little terror .
ok , the first thing is your emergency stop , bridget .
when i tap the dashboard ,
i want you to stop as though a child had run out into the road .
there he is .
the ball' s bounced out , now out he runs .
one , two , three ... stop .
good .
right , emergency stop .
when i hit the dashboard , i want you to react as though a child had ...
that' s not fair .
that' s what a young mother with a pram would now be saying .
back to the test centre .
you know why he failed you ?
emergency stop .
wrong side of the tracks , mate .
ray speight does not pass people from the links estate .
simple as that .
i can always resit it .
and we should rise above that kind of behaviour .
for example , we should not take the piss out of them posh schoolgirls .
i absolutely agree .
i can' t resist it .
afternoon , ladies .
cliff starkey , torquay' s first sexual theme park .
and this here is the barry white of st helens .
the slug of love !
keep off the road , charlotte .
tonight , on sporstweb , channel 15 , the wizards of oz , kyle and mark doohan .
great bowls of fire !
the bowling brothers laid waste to south africa , new zealand and canada in the kyalami lawn classic .
tonight , will america fall ?
from saratoga , it' s australia versus america .
hollywood bowls !
eight p . m .
pacific standard time ...
now , football' s a team game .
yeah ?
great .
but with bowls , you' re on your own .
it' s just your hand , your eye , two and a half pounds of pure wood .
the reason it' s so simple is the reason it' s so magical .
have you seen this ?
the world of bowls cannot provide any competition for the doohan brothers .
i envy you .
i do , because ... you don' t know what it feels like , that first time .
annihilators of every bowling nation under the sun .
the first time you see your wood 20 metres away .
and suddenly , she starts to swing in .
and you know it was you that made that happen .
it' s the most perfect feeling in the world .
it' s the most unbeliev ... ... feeling .
laying waste to all the world' s greatest players .
except one , mate .
mr cocky back out of the box ?
you pretend not to know how good i am .
so how come you only ever play me , who' s so ...
what' s the word ?
crap ?
out of principle , i refuse to go into the royal torquay bowls club .
plus the fact the bloody doohans live in australia .
except for this summer , when they' re coming to england .
... lasted the afternoon !
afternoon , giles .
afternoon , derek .
afternoon , hugh .
afternoon , mutley .
welcome to torquay oxfam .
any trousers to donate ?
ones with arses the size of parachutes that smell of mints and wee .
put them back on the bloody pegs .
right , then ...
davis ...
how do i get picked for england ?
what ?
so i can have a go at the aussies .
by being champion of your county .
right .
off we go , then .
you sexy mother !
couple of minutes .
my god !
you' re playing alan booth .
he' s ranked 16 in devon , but he' s on his way up .
he' s young , he' s hungry and he' s dangerous .
all right ?
when this is over , i want to run through the meaning of " young " and " dangerous " .
nice woods .
canadian maple .
hence the case .
english plastic .
hence the asda bag .
that were a good length , alan !
how about some support for me ?
nice slacks !
oh , no , don' t start that .
great shot .
fight back begins , yeah ?
you' re flying now , mate .
sugar !
you what , my love ?
from the doughnut .
on the green .
i' il use my left hand .
in fact , not only that , alan .
i will concede the entire match if , having struck the jack , my bowl does not end up on this rizla paper .
don' t worry , he does it every night .
blindfolded !
that' s a new one .
oh , mama !
slacks !
slacks on , starkey .
slacks on !
ray , he' s been flicking it and ...
throwing it in the air .
with his feet , ray .
all right , alan .
ray , i' m feeling a little bit left out here .
eating doughnuts .
all right , hugh .
starkey ...
it' s to do with first and last names .
have you been picking the bowl up with your feet ?
i don' t think there' s anything in the rule book about it .
that' s because the rule book never envisaged people like you playing bowls .
and what kind of people am i , ray ?
get off the grass , starkey .
i will ...
speight .
as soon as i' m county champion .
all right ?
game , starkey .
starkey wins .
reg boyt , ladies and gentlemen .
let' s hear it for reg .
a fine eye , a steady hand , and possibly the only bowls player in britain still to be a working porn star !
what did he say ?
never seen " reg does paignton " ?
did he say " porn " ?
the follow up to " open your legs , i need my teeth back " , wasn' t it ?
17 0 , starkey .
hard luck , mate .
it hasn' t stopped yet .
don' t be a bad loser .
the bowl hasn' t stopped yet .
for christ' s sake !
just hang on there .
yours hits mine , sending the jack through the gate , off yours , onto my back .
i' m holding four , 21 0 , i win , you' re buggered .
i thank you !
come on !
that' s it , he' s done it .
game , starkey .
he' s in the final .
come on !
in a moment , i' m going to ask you to do an emergency stop .
" yes ?
starkey won .
damn it !
this is the first time in your life you' ve been quiet for longer than a minute .
i' m going to play for england , aren' t i ?
you' ve got to beat ray speight in this final first , sunshine .
and due respect to all them others that you beat , and all that , but they aren' t in the same class as ray speight .
is he ... ?
he' s good .
he' s the only player i have ever seen who is in your league .
how come if he ain' t been beaten for 23 years in this county , he' s never played for england ?
well , i expect he' s got his reasons .
can you pick me up from the council meeting ?
i' m making another presentation , so i might have a little drink afterwards .
no problem .
i have always felt that a town can be judged on the decorum and standards maintained by its swimming pools .
therefore , i propose that in addition to the notices reading
no diving , no running , no bombing and no petting " we now add the sign ,
no thongs " .
thanks to councillor speight for his vigilance in the field of municipal signage .
all members will join me in wishing him well for his record 24th consecutive southern peninsula bowls title on saturday .
cheers !
you are so beautiful , do you know that ?
so beautiful .
ok , my little angel .
here we go .
nice and easy .
just relax .
enjoy it .
so , this is what torquay' s sexual theme park gets up to after hours .
what' s your name , then ?
kerry .
as in the county ?
i' m cliff .
as in ...
richard .
don' t go near the edge of .
you spoilt that !
don' t worry .
i wouldn' t have had you down as a bowls player .
that depends on what your definition of a bowls player is .
right ?
what is this bowls player of which you speak ?
you can' t define it because you don' t ...
yes , i can .
a 50 year old with a mental age of 70 , who reads the " mail " , votes conservative and thinks a shag is something you put in your pipe .
what i' m trying to say , if you let me finish , is that there are , in fact , two types of bowlers .
yeah ?
there' s bowlers like me , bowlers this town don' t want .
grew up playing on any crappy bit of grass .
sneaking onto ornamental gardens , just to get a taste of that green velvet .
kerry !
then there' s bloody nazi twats like him .

bollocks .
good day , giles .

cliff starkey .
i call upon the outgoing champion to present the trophy .

award .
you ought to melt this down .
it' s only tin , but it' il get your grandad a new suit from oxfam .
we are the champions !
we' re taking home a champion .
you' il have to drive , i' ve had a couple .
come on , mate .
one moment .
mister speight is ...
mister speight is a tosser .
what do you understand by the phrase , " tosser " ?
i am aware that as a bowls player , i am " de facto " a despatcher of bowls .
however , my knowledge of mr starkey would lead me to believe he intended the vernacular sense ...
he' s going to say it ! ... of masturbator .
defacement of a scorecard is a protocol offence
against point 4a paragraph 2 of the ukbc codes and regulations ,
carrying an attendant fine of ?
15 .
well , sod it .
here' s ?
20 .
keep the change .
and a ban from all competition , at the discretion of the injured party .
cliff starkey is hereby banned from any national or international competition for 15 years .
" hear , hear !
" jolly good !
ladies and gentlemen !
the reinstated and record breaking 24th time southern peninsula bowls champion ,
ray speight .
don' t you think 15 years is a little excessive ?
eric cantona got eight weeks and he kicked someone in the head .
it equates , kerry .
in bowls , 15 years is only a sixth of your career .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
seeing as i won' t be needing these any more , you can have them .
yeah !
meet the new boss
same as the old boss
no point running away .
should have worn a mask .
this ain' t funny .
i never said it was .
it' s just another example .
an example of what ?
the torquay mafia , you know !
they all come from the same part of town and they all stick together .
don' t you worry about that .
you did write it .
what ?
you didn' t have to write on the scorecard .
the mentality of your tosspot father .
he' s still my dad .
exactly the same .
off you go .
back into ranks .
go on , off you go .
back into ranks .
" land of hope and glory !
good night , cliff .
mother of the free !
how shall we extol thee ?
here , i brought you these back .
i had to pretend i was keeping them for the police .
it' s bloody ridiculous .
80 hours community service for smashing a few plates ?
why did you do it ?
leave it out , mutley .
tell me !
afford me that .
at least afford the man who brought you up and took you bowling every sunday ...
i am sorry if my mum and dad dying ruined your sundays .
you' ve thrown away the biggest chance you' il ever have .
you took me bowling ' cause you wanted to go .
i stood by , bored off my tits .
i only started playing to keep myself sane .
i knew that .
exactly .
that' s why i kept going and i kept you doing it , until you kept sane to the point where you' d become a genius .
a potential national champion genius !
what did he say that was so terrible ?
it was nothing .
bollocks !
don' t shout at it , mutley .
hello ?
don' t shout at it !
you don' t need to , it' s electronic .
i' il get him .
i think she said it' s the local news .
hello ?
down the line !
pass it !
keep those sticks down .
camilla ?
this is the game of hockey calling .
what the hell are you doing here ?
too bloody right .
it' s burning my feet .
it' s taken a right effort morally to turn up here .
10 8 .
full time .
get changed , please .
what' s that ?
it' s a bit big .
but with a blouse with a frilly cuff , it' d look nice .
you' re trying to get me sacked .
do you know how much i spent on that ?
you won it on that arcade arm thing .
in , please , girls .
come on .
it' s not the real present .
it' s a pre big present .
why am i getting a real present at all ?
he' s still a tosser !
i reserve my right to that opinion .
but he is your dad , even though he is a twat .
and i could have been a little bit more tactical .
you know , blah di blah .
6 . 30 ?
palm gardens ?
unless friday is monopoly night in the speight household , in which case i advise you to buy the stations early on .
you' il have to excuse me , ' cause i' ve got to get interviewed by local television .
in !
having won the county championships at a young age , you' ve been banned for 15 years , cliff starkey .
what was your crime ?
just relax .
yeah , yeah .
just fuck off !
with bowls in danger of being cancelled from television , with young people like you being banned , do you think this sport could die out ?
yeah .
what age are the uk' s bowls committee ?
stone age .
they' re , like , neolithic .
that' s why they hate me .
i' m the sort of bloke that goes on 18 30 holidays .
when they go on holiday , that' s the sort of time they go to bed .
i can' t believe you got tickets for the delays .
we' re going in the vlp area .
i know a bloke who works there .
come on , through here .
on the list .
cliff starkey , " bad boy of bowls " .
this is my girlfriend , cindy .
she does underwear modelling for freemans .
starkey , you scumbag .
i can' t believe you' re still trying this .
leave it .
i' m gonna give you such a kicking .
please , cliff , no !
i' m sorry .
leave it out , please .
all right , cliff , mate ?
how you doing ?
all right ?
there you go .
all right ?
take it easy .
enjoy the gig .
what do you want to drink ?
so that' s how you normally get in , i take it ?
no , i just did that to impress you .
it' s broken , by the way .
what ?
the watch .
i put it on and it started playing the theme to " beverly hills cops " .
then it leaked something brown onto my wrist .
i' il mend it .
i' il get it fixed for you .
still , gig was good .
the gig was good .
i didn' t think you' d come .
i thought you' d presume i was a prat , rather than waiting to find out that i am .
thanks , it' s been a great night .
no , no , don' t go .
now is the time of night i like to ... hot things up a little bit .
do what ?
hot things up a little bit .
don' t be frightened of it .
just ...
go on ...
hold it .
now , you see , that there is the bias .
yeah ?
which means you' re going to have to aim it slightly to the left .
ever so slightly .
there' s a bias in each one of these little ladies .
and it' s going to pull it one way , no matter what .
cliff ...
yeah ?
i fucking hate bowls !
wahey !
i got the three " p" s .
pizza , pilsener and porn !
shops of the west country " .
that documentary you were after .
see ya .
you ... !
i' m sorry .
i am so , so sorry .
you made me look a right prat there .
sorry .
sorry .
shut up .
just piss off .
what' s the matter with you ?
porn shops of the west country " .
i think we got away with it .
i' m sorry .
look , i' ve said i' m sorry .
sorry , bollocks !
you made me out to be the kind of bloke who watches porn .
you are .
not only that , you go out with the kind of girls who appear in it .
kerry' s not like that .
i' m stepping out with a duchess , i am !
shut your mouth .
cliff starkey !
christ , it' s batman .
it' s that bloke from " the matrix " , innit ?
i don' t fucking believe it .
in the flesh ?
i mean , i ...
do you know what you are ?
you' re this .
late ?
gold .
you what , mate ?
you know , i heard they cancelled bowls .
made me so fucking mad !
i' m rick schwartz .
there' s someone i' d like you to meet .
quick , what' s its name ?
the white ball .
the jimmy ?
the jack .
these television guys are so far off the jack , you know ?
the bowls on tv in this country are a disaster , right ?
yeah .
thanks to bbc coverage , bowls is the only olympic sport you can win gold while still smoking a pipe .
that' s right .
you play , do you ?
i' ve rolled a few woods in my time , but you , cliff , i gotta say to you , man , i really love what you do with the game .
that' s why i brought dennis here .
who ?
dennis , as head of bbc sports , you gotta know that athletes are like popcorn .
some pop and some don' t .
believe me , this kid' s a popper .
people might not watch bowls on tv .
but trust me , they' il watch cliff .
his first exhibition match prime time special .
think about it , dennis .
might deflect all the flak you' ve been getting for cancelling bowls .
i' m not sure that ...
the train' s gonna leave the station .
are you on it , or just dicking around ?
that' s not entirely fair , rick .
what makes the difference between a game and a sport ?
passion !
yeah !
passion' s what makes the difference .
passionate is what the cable tv people were when i pitched to them last night .
i gotta run .
what' s going on ?
keep walking , guys .
move , move , move .
hey , hey !
who the hell are you ?
sta .
sports talent associated .
the biggest in the world .
first premiership player to get six figures a week .
me .
first non us boxer to be guaranteed 50 % of the take just for showing up .
me .
he' s banned .
screw the ban .
screw the ban , pal .
what i can do is make cliff starkey the bad boy of british bowls .
i can make him the hottest , richest , sexiest phenomenon in living memory .
listen .
it' s ten paces from here back to my limo .
before i get to five , that man' s going to be making us an offer .
he' s scared he' s about to lose out .
do me a favour .
can you walk with me ?
here we go .
one , two , three ...
rick !
rick !
could i have a moment ?
thank you .
dennis , what can i do for you ?
it' s blackball bowls and it' s live !
featuring the bad boy , cliff starkey , as he takes on the scottish legend , brian " iron wrist " cronk !
you fucker !
i' il have your arse !
i' il have your arse !
i asked you for another prodigy like cliff .
that' s him .
national champion at the age of 45 .
too much too young .
ladies and gentlemen , the bad boy of bowls is in the house !
let' s hear it for cliff starkey !
you hear that ?
that' s for you .
you' re the one they pay to see .
the baddest human ever to roll a jack .
you' re hostile , mobile , volatile !
now , burn it down , baby !
i will !
bad boy !
bad boy !
gonna break out of this city leave the people here behind
let' s bowl this mother !
searching for adventure is the type of life to find
tired of doing day jiobs with no thanks for what i do
come on !
... there must be someone now i' m gonna find out who
do anything you wanna do
do anything you wanna do
isn' t that the young man who did the decorating in this place ?
don' t need no politicians tell me things i shouldn' t be ...
it' s great , isn' t it ?
what a buzz !
brilliant !
all right , trev .
easy , mate .
a joke' s a joke .
slow down .
put your foot down , trevor .
but they tell you what you should do they don' t like to see you grow do anything you wanna do
do anything you wanna do
and you' re looking at , as of this morning , the first bowls player in history to be asked to present an mtv award .
in your capacity as a bowls player or a prick ?
both .
that' s why they want me .
they reckon i' m the maradona of bowls .
undercoat .
after i beat cronk , one bloke reckons i' m georgie best .
brian cronk' s a 60 year old alcoholic .
he couldn' t hit a cow' s arse with a banjo .
and if your agent knows so much about sport , just ask him what happened to maradona in the end .
and hurricane higgins .
all them guys .
undercoat .
forget the bloody undercoat .
nobody watched the snooker before the hurricane .
that' s what happened , doughnut !
it' s the savoy , kerry !
the hotel .
the girl who runs these awards , she' s only putting me up in the bloody savoy !
" i wish grandad could see this .
go on .
i' m walking down this long corridor .
this looks like my door .
oh , my god !
jesus christ !
" what is it ?
there' s loads of fruit , posh pictures all over the wall .
one of those ceilings you get in stately homes .
it ain' t got a bloody bed though .
does that pull out ?
no , you' ve got a separate bedroom .
i got a separate bedroom !
kerry , the bed !
" the bed is jiust ...
wasted ?
yeah .
oh , look at the view !
oh , wow !
tell me .
it' s just magical .
you got to be here .
how final is the ban on cliff starkey ?
why do you ask , chairman collins ?
as you know , we at central committee have lost two million in revenue by being dropped from television .
this afternoon , we were offered 2 . 3 million from targitex sportswear to sponsor the australian test .
oh , well ...
if cliff starkey is playing .
oh .
settle down , because now we have for you , to present the award for best newcomer , a young guy who this year became the most banned player in british sport .
please welcome the bad boy of bowls , cliff starkey !
nobody says that , right ?
nobody says that about bowls !
you say that again , i' il bloody kill ya !
bowls is the new rock and roll !
starkey , bad boy !
" what happened ?
are you ok ?
no , kerry , it was a stunt .
what do you mean ?
that bloke i was fighting with , mike .
he doubles for pierce brosnan .
he' s a bit pissed at the moment .
it was rick' s idea .
for heaven' s sake !
kerry , i met bands .
i just spoke to a bloke who' s on my t shirt .
that hasn' t happened since i saw sooty !
where are you ?
" and i got an advert .
someone wants me to advertise something .
and i said , " i demand a girl comes with me , a particular girl .
i demand this , because ... because , like ...
because when i' m not with her , it feels like someone turned the sun off .
and when i look at her , it feels like my lift' s crashing .
anyway , she couldn' t make it .
so i said , " i know this tart in torquay who i once shagged .
sod off !
mickey' s up on the lion !
kerry !
who was that ?
i' il fill in a form if you like .
you' re right .
there comes a point when a man must acknowledge his girl' s grown up .
that there are things she should be doing
i might have been holding her back from .
the royal torquay bowls club annual dinner .
look inside .
go on .
note the surprise element .
my love of bowls " by ray speight .
yes .
tell me , dad , do you ever wonder whether you love bowls so much because mum left ?
or whether mum left because you love bowls so much ?
in terms of cliff' s profile , there' s a volcanic coup i' m processing right now .
gotta keep it under wraps .
can' t share it .
but what i can tell you is this .
there' s a move to tie cliff in with a brand new government programme that' s gonna help kids from the wrong side of the tracks stay off drugs .
perfect .
britain' s drug estates are one of our chief concerns as a company .
that' s where we sell 80 % of our trainers .
exactly .
action !
and cut .
cliff , you open it after you' ve turned .
that' s when the tingle of taste will leap out of the can and bowl you over .
something' s gonna jump out at me ?
no , it' s a computer effect .
i don' t feel comfortable .
that' s what the blue screen' s for .
actually , we could get him a light .
mike , could we get a green light for him ?
so , you' il open the can on the green light .
ok ?
ok , mark it .
bad boy , diet coke , 3 , take 13 .
and cut .
tell you what .

yeah , keep on reading , guys .
and three hours ago , uk sportsnet offered 4 . 1 .
as soon as you can guarantee starkey plays for england , you' re gonna have australian tvbegging .
bloody speight and his blasted ban .
" the sell through rights are huge .
targitex' s jiust raised to 2 . 9 for the sponsorship deal .
every time this kid receives press coverage , sponsorship goes north .
and believe me , the press coverage he' s received so far is nothing compared to what i can confidently predict they are going to run with tomorrow morning .
come on , that' s the way !
nice !
that' s the way .
get it over .
get it over !
don' t hang about !
slip it in !
good lad .

oh , for god' s sake !
oh , you ... !
trev , do us a favour , mate .
bugger off .

i' d rather be watching man city than listening to you two shagging .
i' ve gotta sit here being a bodyguard .
i' m bloody under orders .
don' t get arsey with rick , mate .
if it' s any easier , stop calling me " mate " and use " employee " .
go on .
good night , trevor .
piss off .
if you' re not going to be grateful for everything ...
grateful ?
grateful ?
it' s a bloody free holiday , mate .
well , thank you for letting me sit on my arse while you have a shag .
for letting them tell me i can' t eat my dinner till you' ve had yours .
thanks for letting them call me a fat fucking butterball .
all in all , thanks for everything .
but funny thing is , next time i fancy a holiday , i' il go to fucking thomas cook !
you' ve got no bloody idea the pressure i' m under .
today i got to open a can of pop to the sound of a bell , with a light in my ...
you great twat !
you are sacked !
you can' t sack me , i' ve quit .
you can' t quit .
i' ve just sacked you .
shit boy !
fucking doughnut face !
i' il pull that fucking perm off ...
what is it about bowls that encourages friendship ?
tosser !
prick !
arsehole !
my speech was going to concern the history of our noble game .
but in light of recent events ...
have you seen ?
he' s all over the papers again .
... the future of the game demands attention .
we' re going to go down in history as the men who killed bowls . ... of like minded people with like minded ideals .
restraint and self control are the jewels in our crown .
any notion of commercialism ...
five million quid down the swanee .
we' ve got to get this ban overturned .
giles !
can' t we get some dirt on ray ?
dirt ?
ray " spotless " speight edited the bloody national rule book .
this we must remember now , particularly when our sport is under attack .
look , here we are again .
the indiscipline and bad language of this ...
fucking wanker !
gotcha !
and in a dramatic new twist ,
bad boy of bowls cliff starkey has been reinstated as southern peninsula champion .
his 15 year ban has been converted to a two week suspension .
what are you waiting for ?
warm up , once round the pitch .
what ?
nice one , miss !
yeah , nice one , miss !
ray speight is a valued servant of the game of bowls .
but we felt that his actions may lately have been clouded by a degree of personal animosity .
we all wish ray well in having a little respite from editing the rule book .
and welcome , cliff starkey , to the england team .
jesus !
look who' s in the neighbourhood !
that' s right .
have you seen the photos ?
i mean , what a place !
has rick got me the best flat in torquay or what ?
unbelievable !
two weeks ago , i was decorating this place .
i love this kitchen .
champagne ?
that' il be rick .
my school has suspended me .
that' s great .
you should have left years ago .
teaching snobby arsed girls .
they' re only going to work for daddy anyway .
some bubbly .
have you seen the photos ?
it' s just the press .
it' s part of being a celebrity .
you' ve got to deal with it .
well , thanks .
thanks for your concern .
what is the matter with you and trevor ?
why can' t you just be happy for me ?
you are so selfish !
i' m playing for england .
thanks to who ?
to my dad , who embarrassed himself ...
i am so sorry i didn' t send flowers .
he was the bloke that banned me , wasn' t he ?
yeah .
if he hadn' t , you wouldn' t be a celebrity .
do you think if you hadn' t been banned , anybody would give a toss who cliff starkey was ?
ok , off you go , back in line .
daddy' s little princess .
land of hope ...
oh , no .
yeah .
yeah !
it works in a caf ?
not in a penthouse .
well , sod off , then .
i will .
i' m going to give you five paces to come back , give me a kiss and say sorry .
one , two ...
bugger off , then .
i' il have a champagne bath on my own .
oh , my god !
dad ?
dad ?
he' s got concussion .
he' s torn ligaments in his knees .
he' il be on crutches for quite a while .
he' s come round ?
what did he say ?
it was that astronomer' s flat .
he got a call saying some american wanted it a week early .
right .
and of course , he had no one to hold the ladder .
no .
all right .
that' s it , we' re done .
you guys get to see one more trick .
what do you want ?
show us the rizla trick !
go ahead , kill it , baby .
give those aussies something to read about tomorrow , and let' s go home .
you ok ?
yeah , yeah .
just , you know ...
had a bit of a thing with kerry .
it' s all right .
kerry .
hi .
have a seat .
ch ?
teau l' azure .
it' s actually two types of grapes .
90 % cabernet , 10 % merlot .
it' s fantastic .
it' s from the oldest vineyard in the world .
lebanon .
bekaa valley .
where' s cliff ?
bekaa valley produces ...
rick !
yeah , i ...
kerry , i' ve been putting this off .
putting what off ?
kerry , there' s a ...
you phone me and tell me cliff wants to apologise .
i turn up here .
you' re here , there' s only two glasses .
oh , my god .
right , i get it .
i get it .
i' ve been kind of stupid , haven' t i ?
look , kerry , the problem with stars ...
rick , i ...
listen .
this is important .
the problem with stars is that about now , about when they' re this far up , they start to look down .
and the things that they were very , very close to suddenly seem to be very far away .
and very small .
and then they get agents .
agents like you , to do their fucking shitty business for them .
a little more , please .
he don' t live here any more .
try millionaires ' row .
my dad' s changed the locks .
come in .
thanks .
no , buddy , you' re not understanding the media coup i' ve been cooking up .
so , let me tell you once again what the english ashes team is going to look like .
the new england captain , cliff starkey .
ken star , " news of the world " .
all right , cliff ?
did you sleep with speight' s daughter just to wind him up ?
just ' cause you haven' t had a shag for 20 years , don' t take it out on me .
you have a question about the training ?
thank you .
dave gort , the " sun " .
cliff , how' s the training ?
i' ve never been a great believer in training , as such .
i think that' s absolutely a fair point to say .
cliff starkey is not bigger than the sport .
he is the fucking sport !
understand ?
can you give the aussies a whopping ?
the didgeri doohan brothers ?
kylie and jason ?
i' il stick ' em on the barbie !
trevor batty , " asian babes " .
cliff , can i ask , is your bad boy image for real ?
or are you the kind of twat who' d get his agent to dump his girlfriend for him ?
what ?
could we have a question from derek of " bowls and bowlers " ?
derek , where are you ?
whoa , tiger !
what did you tell her ?
shwarzenegger' s back in the neighbourhood !
what did you say to kerry ?
see , i figured , " who is the england team ?
who do people , in their fucking guts , want to see play the australians ?
get the fuck out of here .
think about it .
i know you want to know .
who is the one man i would team you with ?
cliff , i know i can be a bit of a bad boy too , but that' s what makes me a genius at what i do .
me and you are the same .
you' re fired .
you are fired .
ok .
ok .
so ...
yeah .
during the six paces between here and that door ,
i want you to think about one thing .
time is very pressing here , boy wonder .
listen to me , kid .
we have a very , very short season to gather our nuts .
i could do without your bitch ass whining when we should be out nut gathering .
i' m going to go now .
one , two , three , four , five , six .
that was a bad move !
in the " history of stupid things " , on that book , you' d be on the fucking cover !
you lost your focus .
she was a fucking distraction .
how blind ?
how stupid ?
ok .
i forgive you .
let' s put it behind us .
come on .
i' il hug the hurt out of you .
come on !
come on !
come on !
right .
well , there' s just ... finally just one itsy bitsy little thing that you should probably remember .
it' s ... bowls .
huh ?
no , no , no !
is kerry in , please ?
mr speight ?
bloody hell , ray !
what kind of ban did you give them lot ?
you can' t talk to people like me .
even though my house is just as big as yours .
and my house is on millionaires ' row , mate .
all because i come from the links estate .
what is your bloody problem ?
i came from the links estate .
what ?
don' t you hide behind that .
i came from the links estate and i' m not scum .
do you know what made me better ?
what got me out of that shithole ?
my game .
that i loved .
that you have ... ... shagged .
and will probably discard .
as you probably have my daughter .
they were taking on extra staff for the final against the aussies .
funny , isn' t it ?
i mean , bowls !
kerry , i didn' t know what was going on .
i didn' t know what was happening .
whatever rick said didn' t come from me .
i' m going to rent a flat .
i didn' t know what was happening .
i had no idea .
i' m absolutely fine .
i fired him .
i fired him .
cliff starkey , the bad boy of bowls , will face the world champions , kyle and mark doohan , teamed up with the man he insulted , ray speight .
i didn' t know that was happening , either !
you don' t seriously think i had anything to do with setting that up , do you ?
i' m not afraid of anything in this world there' s nothing you can throw at me that i haven' t already heard i' m jiust trying to find a decent melody a song that i can sing in my own company
you and me , man .
i never thought you were a fool
" i will concede the entire match " if my bowl does not end up on this rizla paper .
you gotta stand up straight carry your own weight
you little bastard !
you asked for this .
you had it coming !
drown , you buggers !
who' s laughing now , then ?
have you seen this girl ?
no , sorry , mate .
who looks stupid now ?
don' t say that later will be better now you' re stuck in a moment and you can' t get out of it
what the hell are we going to do ?
do we have a plan b ?
what do you mean , plan b ?
there can' t be a plan b. it' s ray or no ray .
bloody hell !
we twist every rule in the book to get him out .
now we' re ruined if we can' t get him back .
what if we tell him we got it wrong ?
ray , we checked the rule book , and you can say the word " wanker " .
hurts losing a child , don' t it , mr speight ?
whatever way it happens .
you don' t realise you can hurt that much .
all right , don' t talk to me , ray .
what do i know , anyway ?
only a bloody decorator .
i' m a fan , though .
big fan .
big admirer .
i can' t do much in life , but i can put wallpaper up straight .
and recognise talent .
it' s funny the way it happens , isn' t it , ray ?
in life ?
even though for 30 years you' ve ignored me in corridors , and you stand for everything that depresses me about this country ,
i still love watching you play .
loved watching you beat john cullen with that little in swinger , 1979 .
1983 , against andrew park , winning from four ends down .
thing i do know , ray , is that you are a world class player , who was never brave enough to play for his country .
do you think if you hadn' t been banned , anybody would give a toss who cliff starkey was ?
cliff starkey , the bad boy of bowls , will face the world champions , kyle and mark doohan , teamed up with the man he insulted , ray speight .
it' s bowls , the sport that time forgot .
reborn tonight on a rink of fire , on a crimson green , in the purpose built targitex bowladrome , torquay .
at its helm , perhaps the highest octane sportsman this country has ever seen .
son , what have you done ?
you' re caught by the river you' re coming undone
you' ve got a limousine , mr starkey .
please pick up the phone .
but you can' t jiust leave it ' cause you' re not in control no more and you give it all away would you give it all away , yeah ?
don' t let it come apart don' t want to see it come apart
he got in the limo .
let' s go !
while you' re giving it ...
i didn' t think you' d play .
i' m an englishman .
tosser !
you and i we' re so full of love and hope ...
oh , yes !
mr daly , my name' s giles booth .
allow me to introduce my committee .
nice job , people .
first it was cricket , then rugby , then even football .
now australia hold sway over the world of bowls .
the doohan brothers , unbeaten , remember , in seven years , face an ashes team at war with itself .
cliff starkey , ray speight .
yesterday we called them enemies .
tonight we call them england .
come on , guys .
proud to be english ?
yeah , yeah !
don' t want to see you come apart then you give it all away but you give it all away don' t let it come apart don' t want to see it come apart
this isn' t bowls .
well , it is now .
step forward , gentlemen .
little tighter , just for the camera , please .
beautiful country , australia .
eat shit !
referee , protocol !
those players are ... your referee , julian maycock .
england , starkey .
england , first mat .
here we go .
i' m dave zilato , and with me is the man with the stats .
angus loughran .
thanks , dave .
this is the first prime time bowls match since england versus canada in 1962 .
which was , incidentally , the only prime time televised bowls match .
fascinating .
angus will be keeping us up with lots of stats throughout the game .
so here we go , folks .
it' s the ashes .
but will it be ashes to ashes ?
or will tonight a phoenix rise ?
we are about to find out .
" what is that , angus ?
" must be nerves , dave .
is the bad boy trying to psyche out the australians with some naughty mind games ?
10 degrees at the 15 yard mark .
oh , it' s going to be well wide .
" wide and long .
" that' s a gutterball , dave .
10 degrees at the 10 .
good line , good weight .
15 degrees at the 20 .
bowlometer' s happy , dave .
that' s a sweet , sweet opener from mark doohan .
he' s pleased with that .
look at that , right in the red zone .
let' s see what the old master can come up with .
aim ...
assess ...
dropped it short , well short .
28 % low on power and short of the score zone .
kyle doohan .
and he' s away .
australia lead , 11 0 .
what' s going on , dave ?
we' ve all heard of bad boy starkey , but this is bad bowls starkey .
he' s technically very ragged .
you see , this is what happens .
this is exactly what happens .
wait a minute .
where' s the guy that wipes your ass ?
oh , that' s right .
you fired him and he' s in london .
tosser !
tosser !
this is a terrible shame , dave .
the sport does not need this , angus .
just play your normal game , yeah ?
i' m stood on a red green , using blue woods , with 2, 000 people shouting " tosser " .
please , remind me what my normal game is .
england debating tactics down there .
5 at the 15 , 7 at the 30 .
" bias kicking in .
5 at the 40 .
" that' s better .
that is not a bad lie from ray speight .
england , holding one .
my word , that put paid to that .
sorry , mate .
dave , 13 0 is a real test , psychologically .
no team in the history of lawn bowls has come back from 13 down .
england have to get something from this next hand , haven' t they , angus ?
ok , nerves of steel required .
auditorium silent .
they know the situation england are in .
" and here we go .
" 8 at the 15 .
" he' s trying to draw to the jack .
" weight' s crucial here .
" feels overtipped .
" it' s well overtipped !
not good .
he can' t handle it !
gets to the big dance , no one to hold his hand .
he' s lost .
you don' t get it .
i fuckin ' hate bowls .
hold on .
that' s it , isn' t it ?
you' ve lost it .
dave , look at this .
this was always on the cards if they' re put under pressure , if the old conflicts start coming out .
that' s the highest half time lead since australia against japan in 1989 .
and they didn' t have a half time then , it was jiust halfway through the game .
hey , cliff !
don' t worry , mate .
you can turn this round .
i get big match nerves myself some ...
that' s interesting .
maybe he' s only good when he' s playing people who are crap !
jon , so many expectations , so many hopes pinned on his shoulders .
has it all got a bit too much for starkey ?
what' s the mood ?
i wish i could tell you , dave .
i' ve been in the england dressing room , and cliff starkey has disappeared .
this isn' t a stunt , though it might be a stunt they' re unaware of .
but whatever , no one in torquay knows where cliff starkey is .
so , are you going back in ?
you' re just going to let my dad play all on his own out there ?
rubik' s cube or a toblerone ?
i don' t believe this !
have you any idea what it' s taken my dad to ...
how dare you walk away from me ? !
have you any idea what it' s taken my dad to get out there tonight ?
tonight my dad has done an incredibly brave thing , the first brave thing in a life of abject weakness .
he' s gone out there and he' s nailed his colours to the mast and steeled himself .
where the hell are you going ?
you' ve both given up everything you had in your lives for your sport .
what exactly do you have left to lose ?
this has gone past bizarre .
i have to tell viewers returning for the second half
australia are two minutes and ten seconds away from winning the ashes by default , due to a no show by both english players .
nothing is worth this .
nothing is worth taking your life for .
you bloody twat !
hold onto that , i' il be back in a minute .
we didn' t run .
that' s what matters .
you don' t mean that , do you , ray ?
no .
cream the bastards !
starkey to bowl .
rizla trick !
rizla trick !
rizla trick ?
rizla trick !
rizla trick !
here we go .
first time we' ve seen this .
starkey starting to play up to the audience .
excuse me , my love .
" talking to the audience , in fact !
" now what' s he up to ?
" oh , thank you , madam !
plenty of room in there !
he' s certainly putting a smile on the audience' s face there .
he' s not seriously going to ...
he is !
oh , mama !
yeah !
after an abjiect first half , the uproar tells you everything .
it' s starkey' s legendary rizla trick .
at last the english crowd have got something to cheer about .
wind me up , put me down start me off and watch me go
i' il be running circles around you sooner than you know
a little off centre and i' m out of tune just kicking this can along the avenue but i' m all right
you' re joking ?
you can' t just turn up and hope to get in .
this is bowls .
come on .
what ?
you' re going down , boy .
you jierk it out
you jierk it out
come on .
bollocks !
give us the phone .
the four corners of the empire trick .
get down .
ray' s favourite , this one .
come on !
ok , in you go .
don' t worry .
oh , you are a treasure .
thanks , pet .
mark doohan , crucial bowl for australia .
what ?
i dunno .
you started this fucking mumbling shit !
first sign of tension in the australian camp .
matilda not waltzing at the moment !
15 degrees at the 10 , it' s not a good line .
" too much weight .
" 5 degrees at the 40 .
" it' s overtipped !
" going long and wide .
the deadly doohans become the dreadful doohans , angus .
nice .
eat shit .
england , holding one .
as the end stands , we' re tied at 17 all .
speight has potentially the winning wood .
tricky end here , though , dave .
needs perfect weight .
tosser !
he' s bottomed it !
doohan said something .
big deal .
time .
this is the last wood .
and the jack' s been struck .
jack in the gutter is live , which will make mark doohan' s last bowl the winning wood .
the doohan bowl' s still in motion , dave .
protocol !
" starkey knows it .
the bloody prannet !
" he' s up to something !
" if there' s any movement on that ball , " the game is still live .
tosser , tosser !
the ball' s in motion .
it' s not over .
if that ball drops , it' s out of play and will not score .
that' s bowls , mate .
out of play .
that' s a draw .
17 all .
calm down , gentlemen .
a tie is enough .
have we tied ?
no , ray .
tragically , this is television .
thunderbowl !
it' s the thunderbowl , the ultimate test of bowling nerve .
one jack , one wood , closest wins .
it' s bowls for the brave .
well , dave .
england ?
penalty shoot outs ?
you' ve got to try and believe , angus .
kyle doohan for australia .
10 degrees at the 10 .
speed , 15 . 7 .
this is good .
computer likes it .
red zone , 2 degrees .
great line .
oh , this is good .
oh , yes !
would you look at that ?
yes !
i cannot believe it .
dear , oh , dear .
what must they be thinking ?
starkey , top on .
starkey jiust being asked to put a top on .
17 million viewers and he' s not even wearing our bloody logo !
cliff !
" someone in the crowd' s obliged .
that' s better .
oh , my god !
go on .
six weeks ago , this boy was a torquay decorator .
the eyes of the nation now rest on him .
what are his options , angus ?
in swinger .
what , love ?
he has to fire it to split them .
he has to fire it .
he can' t fire it .
in swinger .
firing it won' t work .
you need a cool in swinger .
trust the bias .
let the wood do the work .
" what' s happening here ?
" 35 at the 10 .
it' s going off the rink .
what has starkey done ?
he' s gone for a huge in swinger .
surely he should have blasted that kiss apart .
hold on .
computer says 45 at the 30 .
and tightening !
good man .
" this is unbelievable .
" how much spin has he put on this ? !
angus , it' s on line , it is on line !
and it' s going to get there , dave !
it' s there !
it' s on it !
whoa , whoa !
