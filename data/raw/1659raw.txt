this is a true story ... story of my sister daisy and my cousin gracie and me when we were little .
our people , the jigalong mob , we were desert people then , walking all over our land .
my mum told me about how the white people came to our country .
they made a storehouse here at jigalong ... brought clothes and other things ... flour , tobacco , tea .
gave them to us on ration day .
we came there , made a camp nearby .
they were building a long fence .
my dad was a white man working on that fence .
the white people called me a half caste .
see that bird ?
that' s the spirit bird .
he will always look after you .
hey , granddaughter , watch where you run .
you kids will destroy the tracks .
he' s here somewhere .
keep looking .
maybe over there .
here they are .
look .
he' s going this way .
see the tracks .
here , here ... in the tree .
watch out for his claws .
good hunters in this family .
you' re growing up fast , molly .
that' s them .
yeah .
molly' s the big one .
the little one' s her sister , daisy .
the middle one' s their cousin gracie .
well , what about their fathers ?
moved on .
fat one .
molly , hide those kids .
policeman ...
iooking for half castes .
next batch .
nothing out of the ordinary .
there' s 2 applications for section 63 exemptions .
the police reports are there .
william harris is applying for permission to marry ... uh , she' s half caste also ... and mary wilson is applying for permission to visit her child at moore river .
she' s quite agitated .
oh , and gladys phillips has written for permission to buy some new shoes .
she got a new pair a year ago .
uh , now , this report from constable riggs about the three little half caste girls at the jigalong fence depot ...
molly , gracie , and daisy .
the youngest is of particular concern .
she' s promised to a full blood .
i' m authorizing their removal .
they' re to be taken to moore river as soon as possible .
oh , and , miss thomas , if you could check that the rate for police transportation is still ,
i believe , 8 pence per mile .
yes , mr. neville .
thank you .
that country over there , that' s woman country .
you can' t go there .
you get big trouble .
yeah , i know .
where your country ?
my country ?
down south .
long way from here .
our dad works there , on the rabbit fence .
yeah ?
how far does rabbit fence go to ?
rabbit proof fence ... ... goes all the way to the sea down that way .
right to the top of australia .
longest fence in the world .
and all the way to the sea down that way .
1, 500 miles long .
keeps the rabbits on that side of the fence , keeps the farmland on this side of the fence .
that molly' s going to be a big girl .
mr. neville' s been writing to me about those girls , you know .
you tell that mr. devil molly not going .
she get married .
you tell that mr. devil he want half caste kid , he make his own .
frankie .
come on .
it' s your turn .
come and get your rations .
hurry up .
gracie !
come on !
come for the three girls , maude !
no !
no !
this my kids !
mine !
it' s the law , maude .
you got no say in it .
no !
mine !
mr. neville' s orders !
listen .
any running , and i' il lock your mother up .
mr. neville is their legal guardian .
no !
keep away from us !
no !
no !
no !
gracie !
give me back my kids !
come on , little one .
you sit up , and you stay .

i' ve got the papers , maude !

you' ve got no say in it !
no !
come on !
no !
get in the car !
now , the three of youse ... don' t move .
there' s nothing you can do here , old girl .
nothing you can do !
no !
no !
as you know , every aborigine born in this state comes under my control .
notice , if you will , the half caste child .
and there are ever increasing numbers of them .
now , what is to happen to them ?
are we to allow the creation of an unwanted third race ?
should the coloreds be encouraged to go back to the black , or should they be advanced to white status and be absorbed in the white population ?
now , time and again , i am asked by some white man ,
if i marry this colored person , will our children be black ?
and as chief protector of aborigines , it is my responsibility to accept or reject those marriages .
here ...
... is the answer .
three generations . half blood grandmother , quadroon daughter , octoroon grandson .
now , as you can see , in the third generation , or third cross , no trace of native origin is apparent .
the continuing infiltration of white blood finally stamps out the black color .
the aboriginal has simply been ... bred out .
now ... we come to ...
we come to the moore river native settlement .
ladies , most of you are familiar with our work here ... the training of domestic servants and farm laborers .
i would like to thank you for your continuing support .
hundreds of half caste children have been gathered up and brought here to be given the benefit of everything our culture has to offer .
for if we are to fit and train such children for the future , they cannot be left as they are .
and in spite of himself , the native must be helped .
hello , there .
a ghost .

you must be exhausted .

moodoo .
mr. neal tells me that your probation period is up and that you wish to return to the kimberleys .
is that right ?
of course , your daughter is here , isn' t she ?
there would be no question of her going .
she would have to stay here and continue her training .
i think for the time being it would be best for all concerned if you were to remain here , moodoo .
i' d be prepared to consider your case in a year or so , but , uh ... until then .
mr. neal , i don' t want you to feel guilty .
yes .

ask them for something to eat .
hey , you' re from that moore river place , eh ?
we' re going home .
where your country ?
jigalong .
jigalong ?
proper long way .
you know what you' re doing ?
that tracker from moore river ... ... he pretty good .
i heard he get them runaways all the time .
got to be good to beat him .
he' il take you back to that place .
here .
you watch out for him , eh ?
you think you' re so smart ?
where are we ?
we' re lost .
jigalong that way .
north .
tracker followed them to ... this river bank , but lost their tracks in the water about a week ago .
there' s been no sign of them since .
three little half castes .
we' re talking quite a few man hours here .
who' s going to pay for it ?
well , there' s very little money in my departmental budget .
i' m hoping that if your men can in some way combine this with their regular duties ...
we' il be able to handle all the notifications , posting all the police stations , farms , et cetera .
we' il provide a description , of course .
but if my men have to make trips outside of their duties , then i' m afraid it' il have to be an impost on your department .
if your men are out on other jobs at the same time , there would be no extra expense .
i' il concede that , mr. neville .
and it is the job of every one of your men in their role as local protectors .
my men will do their jobs , mr. neville .
now , a week ago , you said .
yes .
hey , maude , your girls have gone .
what' d you say ?
run away from moore river .
they' re gone .
everybody' s lookin ' for ' em .
and what do you think you might be up to ?
thieving my eggs , eh ?
you come out here where i can see you .
come on .
stand up .
out you come .
and get rid of that bread .
it' s filthy .
you want something to eat , you ask for it .
come on .
i' m not gonna bite you .
you on your own ?
hmm ?
got anyone with you ?
papa .
where you girls planning on going ?
cat got your tongue , eh ?
now get .
go on .
and watch out for those boys further along .
they go out hunting rabbits along the fence .
that rabbit proof fence ?
yes , the rabbit proof fence .
where that rabbit fence ?
east .
which way now ?
that way ... that fence .
find that rabbit fence , we go home .
then we see our mum .
the chief protector of aborigines , mr. a. o. neville ...
devil ! " ... is concerned about three native girls
ranging from 8 to 14 years of age
who , a month ago , ran away from the moore river native settlement .
yay !
he would be grateful if any person who saw them
would notify him promptly . " ' we have been searching high and low for the children for a month past , ' added mr. neville .
devil !
' and all the trace we found of them was a dead rabbit . " '
it' s the fence !
it' s the fence !
she found it !
the latest sighting , which is four days old ...
the man from the newspaper .
i have nothing more to say to him .
please , now , move on .
yes ?
bunnawarra .
yalgoo .
dalwallinu .
bunnawarra .
yalgoo .
dalwallinu , bunnawarra , yalgoo .
they' re on the fence .
they' re following the rabbit proof fence .
right .
just because people use neolithic tools , inspector , does not mean they have neolithic minds .
this makes our task very much easier .
look , there' s a branch off here to the west north of yalgoo .
now , you put your man out here on the fence north of this junction .
he can start to come down it to meet them .
i' il have moodoo come up from the south behind them .
we can' t miss them .
where daisy ?
wait here .
my legs , molly ...
they hurt .
i can' t walk .
i' il carry you only one once , so there .
come on .
come on .
don' t think i' m carrying you all the way .
camp , molly .
company .
where you girls headed ?
you goin ' to mullewa ?
you got family there ?
where mullewa ?
mullewa ?
west .
why , you' re headed along the number 2 fence .
you got two rabbit proof fence ?
why , uh , we got three of ' em .
we' re on the wrong fence .
where the north fence ?
north fence ?
back that way , where you come from .
you can cut across .
i' il show you .
number 1 rabbit fence .
here' s the number 2 fence .
now , you' re here .
but you wanna be here .
now , if you cut across here ... you' il save yourself a hundred mile or so .
it' s not hard .
i' m goin ' back .
i don' t have the petrol .
over here .
and we hungry .
youse that lot from moore river .
yeah .
what , you girls walk all that way ?
hmm .
800 miles .
i was there .
too scared to run away , but everyone was always caught , stuck in that boob .
youse got the furtherest .
where you headin ' ?
home .
mavis !
stay here .
i' il come back and get you .
you can sleep with me tonight .
i' il get you some food .
just getting the washing , mrs. evans !
shh .
what' s that ?
someone coming .
quick , quick !
in the bed !
under the blankets !
damn you , mavis .
mr. evans .
i' il get you for this .
go away .
don' t you worry about that .
come on , quick .
get up .
get up .
come on .
shh , shh , shh .
don' t go , molly .
please don' t go .
he come back if you go .
don' t go .
he won' t say anything .
please .
paul evans ?
hello .
wake ... wake up !
wake up !
you gotta go !
let' s have a look .
run that way !
just keep going !
they were running out over there about an hour or so ago .
we' il pick up their tracks in the morning .
i' il make a cup of tea .
that' s the tracker .
yeah , that' s him .
hop on .
i do not expect you to understand what i am trying to do for these people , but i will not have my plans put into jeopardy .
people fail to understand that the problem of half castes is not simply going to go away .
if it is not dealt with now , it will fester for years to come .
these children are that problem .
please explain exactly what happened .
i don' t know how they did it , but we lost them .
had larson out there , moodoo was with him , and we lost them .
they' re making right fools of us .
they are indeed , inspector , and the cost is more than to just our pride .
the reputation of this department is beginning to suffer .
i can assure you that my men have better things to do than chase your charges all around the country .
they' re coming into very rough terrain .
once they' re much past meekatharra ...
i can' t risk any of my men .
i agree ... we must find them before they get into the real desert country .
so , [ exhales ] ... this is what we' re going to do .
you get your man up there .
moodoo can join him .
well up the fence ... around here , hmm ?
far enough up so that we know we cannot possibly miss them .
and i want them to stay there .
they can set up camp and wait .
costly ?
well , we' il just have to bear it .
their lives may be at stake .
and , inspector , i understand the mother of one of the girls has gone to wiluna .
the children are headed into that country .
i want the word spread .
let' s see what that does .
you wouldn' t get me out there .
she' s pretty clever , that girl .
she wants to go home .
good thing you kids ran into me .
lot of people worried for you .
the police are up and down the country looking for youse .
it' s in all the papers .
which one of you is gracie ?
you gracie ?
i hear your mummy in wiluna .
you can catch a train there from meeka .
come on .
let' s go .
wiluna ?
is she at wiluna ?
yes .
come on , gracie .
don' t listen to him .
he' s a liar .
maybe she' s there , molly .
maybe he telling the truth .
molly ...
let' s go to meeka , catch a train to wiluna .
they see us , they' il catch us .
we can' t stop now .
we must keep going .
we' re nearly there .
but , molly ...
mummy there .
she at wiluna .
i want mummy .
come on .
come on , daisy .
come on , daisy .
you have to carry me , molly .
hop on .
she not coming .
don' t look back .
don' t look back .
she' il come .
higher .
you got ' em ?
three ... one for you , one for me , and one for both of us .
mmm .
come on , dais .
we gotta go back for gracie .
go !
what are you gonna do , sell the meat or what ?
i' ve got her !
i want to catch the train !
i want to catch the train to mummy !
this one come ... think mummy' s here .
gracie ...
hey , grab her !
hey !
got you !
get in that car now .
thanks , jacky .
there' il be a shilling for you back at the station .
taking you back where you belong .
she gone , molly .
she not coming back .
needle in a haystack .
well , that' s it .
pack your stuff .
we' re getting out of here .
they' re only paying us for three weeks .
to constable riggs , police station , nullagine ... the two missing half caste girls ...
molly and daisy ... are returning to jigalong via the rabbit proof fence , our efforts to apprehend them thus far having come to naught .
i therefore expect them to arrive in jigalong in about a month' s time .
in your capacity as local protector , you are to proceed to jigalong to await their arrival and effect their recapture .
yours , et cetera .
no fence .
i want mother .
mmm .
that fence will come back .
home .
it' s coming through now .
riggs arrived jigalong .
awaits your instructions .
yes , there will be a reply .
please wait .
girls to be sent south via meekatharra .
to be accompanied at all times .
awaiting notification .
what' s all that about ?
just some women' s business .
been going on all day .
hey , molly ?
yeah ?
that tracker ... he not gonna get us now ?
no , he not gonna get us .
i' m not gonna stay here .
i can feel it .
they' re up to something .
i' m gonna go take a look .
i lost one .
i lost one .
to constable riggs , police station , nullagine ... at present we lack the funds to pursue the missing half caste girls ...
molly and daisy .
i would ask to be kept informed of their whereabouts so that at some future date they may indeed be ... recovered .
we face an uphill battle with these people ... especially the bush natives ... who have to be protected against themselves .
if they would only understand ... what we are trying to do for them .
yours , et cetera .
thank you .
we walked for nine weeks , a long way , all the way home .
then we went straightaway and hid in the desert .
got married .
i had two baby girls .
then they took me and my kids back to that place , moore river .
and i walked all the way back to jigalong again , carrying annabelle , the little one .
when she was 3 , that mr. neville took her away .
i' ve never seen her again .
gracie is dead now .
she never made it back to jigalong .
daisy and me , we' re here living in our country , jigalong .
we' re never going back to that place .
