11 : 30 you said ?

okay , great .
all right , thanks .
and don' t forget to bring your own steaks .
i' il see you then .
yeah , okay .
i' m saving for my car .
i' m paying it off this month .
surprise !
hello .
hi .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
you were crying .
yeah .
is it something bad ?
i don' t know .
i' il see you later .
i have to go to a gay straight alliance meeting .
okay .
hi , acadia , how you doing ?
we were talking about walking down a street being gay .
what do you think about that ?
how can you tell ?
or can you tell ?
good question .
see , that' s the thing .
i don' t think you can .
i think in some situations you can tell ... and there are situations where people want you to know .
what makes you think you can tell ?
if somebody wants you to know .
if someone has ... dyed pink hair .
wait , what do you think about that ?
i know it is , but what do you think about that ?
i don' t think that wearing pink ... indicates your sexual orientation necessarily .
a lot of men wear pink .
it is a lot , yeah .
like rainbow necklaces .
i mean , if you have tons of rainbow paraphernalia ...
jump in on this .
help them out here a little bit .
come on .
did you guys see the cover story on the oregonian about the gay rams ?
yeah .
see , this is a good topic here .
go ahead .
because apparently the farmers can' t tell if the rams are gay or not .
so you get a ram to breed and it' s not ... so they waste a lot of money .
so they' re doing all this research .
they spend , like , $10, 000 on a ram .
that' s a lot of money for one ram .
but the scary thing is if they know what causes homosexuality ... is that something you could change , something you could remove ?
there' s all this weird political stuff around it .
i don' t think we' re talking about the change , necessarily .
we' re talking about if we notice somebody on the street ... if we can tell they' re gay .
i don' t think you can .
how in the world do we know their spirit ?
if they wear one of those bracelets , the rainbow and stuff , that' s a giver .
somebody walking on the street , all dressed up , wearing high heels ...
rainbow bracelets don' t necessarily mean that you' re gay .
i' ve never seen anybody wear one that isn' t gay .
me , for example .
then why would it even matter ?
you' re wearing a bracelet and you' re not gay .
who cares either way ?
what time will you be back ?
right around 1 : 30 p . m .
okay .
here' s the deal .
aaron and i and some of the other boys ... we' re gonna go fourbying later today .
we were wondering if maybe you would like to bring some of the girls along .
don' t you remember what happened last time ?
of course .
how could i forget ?
with sara and jessica ?
sara and jessica , they' re ...
don' t be mean .
i never tease you about jason and his hot dogs , or whatever .
that was an isolated incident .
besides , i don' t know if i can go .
i don' t know what time i' il get home .
home from the appointment ?
yeah .
does that , by any chance , have to do with ... when we went camping , two or three weeks ago ?
i don' t know .
it could be anything .
you know what ?
you don' t have to worry about it .
you know why ?
because we' re gonna have a blast fourbying ... as long as ...
you gotta promise to show up .
hey , eli !
what' s up , john ?
how' s it going ?
pretty good .
what are you doing ?
just taking pictures .
can i take a picture of you ?
yeah , sure .
okay , ready ?
one , two , three .
nice .
i' il see you later .
you going to the concert tonight ?
no , my parents are being bitches .
that' s retarded .
that happens .
all right .
i' il see you .
boomer !
come here .
what are you guys doing ?
get the fuck out of here and don' t come back .
some heavy shit' s going down .
what are you doing ?
when the electrons jump from one orbital to another one ... what does that do ?
what' s the difference between the orbitals ?
the orbitals differ in energy .
the orbitals , which are areas in space around the nucleus ... the ones that are closer to the nucleus , those are low energy ... and the ones that are further away are higher energy .
so when we put energy into the atom ... it kicks these electrons out ... further away from the nucleus , and produces a higher ...
yes ?
after putting electricity into the tube full of the electrons ... after they' re lit up , do they stay lit up or can they run out of energy ?
good question .
what they do ... is they will sit up in this higher energy state ... and then drop down again .
and when they drop down , they emit light .
what are you writing ?
this ?
yeah .
it' s my plan .
for what ?
you' il see .
hey , eli , what' s up ?
hey , how are you ?
not much .
i' m just gonna go to the darkroom and stuff , so ...
yeah .
watch out for mr. robertson' s class .
yeah , i know .
no kidding .
all right , i' il see you later .
okay .
bye .
how you doing ?
pretty good , actually .
how about you ?
fine .
michelle , look , we' ve got to talk about this gym clothes problem .
this is not gonna do it , these long pants .
everybody else is wearing shorts .
what' s the matter ?
i don' t want to talk about it .
i don' t want to give you a mark against you , either .
but i' il have to do it if you can' t show up in shorts ...
like you are supposed to .
look , i won' t do anything about it this time ... but tomorrow , i want to see those shorts .
okay !
there' s that nerd girl who sits behind you in math class .
that one right there .
yeah .
her .
green panties ?
loser .
where' d you take that at ?
the bleachers outside .
pretty blurry , though .
what' s that ?
it' s a rip in his shirt .
i thought it was coming out of her head .
i took that outside at the park earlier .
really ?
that' s pretty .
where' d you take that at ?
at my house .
that' s my light assignment .
great contrast .
i like how you can barely see the fence right there .
i think i' il make another print , though .
it came out too light .
yeah , you should burn in right here .
hey , eli .
what' s up , john ?
how' s it going ?
good , how about you ?
pretty good .
what are you doing ?
just taking pictures .
can i take a picture of you ?
yeah , sure .
okay , ready ?
one , two , go .
nice .
all right , i' il see you later .
you going to the concert tonight ?
no , my parents are being bitches .
that' s retarded .
that happens .
all right .
see you .
come on out here .
i got a job for you here .
you can take these books ... and you can reshelf them right over there , if you would , please .
i' il be here if you need me .
that' s what they told me .
i don' t know .
i mean , it' s really hard to decide .
yeah , i know .
i mean , the money' s really nice , but ...
he' s so cute .
did she see you ?
who ?
did she see you ?
who ?
her .
his girlfriend .
he has a girlfriend ?
since when ?
you didn' t know ?
no , i didn' t .
a long time .
are you joking ?
i hope she didn' t see you .
she' s not gonna do anything .
she hit a girl last time for that .
hit a girl ?
she slapped a girl .
no way .
she smiled , he smiled , and she slapped her .
my gosh , i cannot believe that .
are you joking ?
i saw it .
why wouldn' t she slap him ?
because ...
it' s not the girl' s fault .
all girls do that .
in the middle of the hall ?
yeah .
after school last friday .
wow , i am so tired .
i haven' t been getting any sleep lately ...
' cause every morning , i wake up and my mom' s going through my stuff .
going through your stuff ?
yeah .
completely , like , ruffling through my covers and like ...
your covers ?
yeah .
like , what would i hide there ?
what am i gonna be hiding ?
i don' t know .
didn' t your mom used to do that to you ?
she did that a couple days ago .
don' t go through my shit .
i don' t go through yours .
it' s not like you own my stuff .
i don' t own your stuff .
i don' t know .
okay , i' m sorry .
i won' t do it anymore .
and then all of sudden , i' il come home , and she' s in my room .
they think it' s their job because they' re the parents of the house .
i' m sick of it .
i want out of here .
i' m so ready to go to college .
yeah , i wanna get out of here .
only one more year , though , you guys .
one more year .
count it down .
what to eat ?
i can' t wait to go off campus .
can i help you ?
can i have a milk ?
wait , no , i think i want a capri sun .
can i have a juice ?
i' il have that milk .
thanks .
juice .
this one .
yeah .
thanks .
what do i want ?
none of it looks that good .
it never does .
some kids like this stuff .
thank you .
i know , they come back for , like , seconds and thirds .
they just keep coming ?
salads ?
it' s too crowded .
let' s go to the back .
where' s a table nobody' s sitting at ?
where' s your salad dressing ?
i don' t eat salad dressing anymore .
you don' t ?
i thought you loved it .
no , i hate it .
i used to like it , and then i tried once without it .
i cannot stand it without .
you know it has fat ?
you know salad dressing has 20 grams of fat in it ?
shut up .
it' s not like it stays in us anyway .
i can' t believe you just said that .
what if somebody heard you ?
it' s the truth .
is that john ?
what is he doing ?
is that a dog ?
i didn' t know he had a dog .
why would he bring it to school if he did have a dog ?
i have no idea .
maybe he just found it .
you guys want to go shopping today ?
that sounds like fun .
i don' t know .
ben wanted to do something .
are you joking me ?
what ?
this is the fifth day in a row you' re not hanging out with us .
you guys , it' s like , how much time do you want ?
put a number on it .
i don' t even want to talk about it .
you spend so much time with him .
you get , like , 75 % to 85 % of my time .
yeah , right .
more like 20 % .
you do !
school , after school ...
you know , you can' t have both weekends .
i need to split it a little more evenly .
we' re not just people to be pushed out of the way .
i' m not saying that .
you' re both very important to me .
i' m supposed to be your best friend and you pushed me out of it .
you' re both equally as important , but my time has to be split up .
what do you want ?
95 % and he gets 5 % ?
your friends are supposed to be just as important , if not more .
all the time .
haven' t you ever heard that ?
i' ve heard that , but it' s different .
i' ve been there for you , through everything .
we' ve been best friends for , what , three years now ?
since high school started .
i know , i' m working .
i' m done , guys .
let' s just go .
i' m going shopping .
sounds like fun .
i' il go .
i don' t want to be the only one not going .
i' il go .
okay , i' il go , but you cannot drive .
yeah , you' re not driving .
i am such a good driver .
you are not .
that' s mean .
you guys can' t say that .
i don' t understand because everyone else thinks i' m a good singer ... and a couple of weeks ago , when i sang star spangled banner ... everyone thought it was really good .
that' s why i' m really confused that you would say something like that .
seriously , i mean , why ?
why do you think i' m such a bad singer ?
do you guys have cars ?
because i don' t think you do .
so , how else are you going to get anywhere ?
we' il go , just drive 15 under the speed limit .
you have to have your hands at ten and two .
that' s no fun .
go back to the basic rules .
when you guys get your licenses , you' il understand .
we' il understand ?
i just want to live to get my license .
we want to live to see the rest of our lives .
i' m not gonna kill you .
it' il be in the newspaper ...
i might run into a couple of people on the way , but ...
it' s not funny .
oh , my gosh .
it' il be fine .
we' il just go .
this is disgusting .
i ate too much .
i always feel so fat after i' m done eating .
every time .
do you ever get ...
the pudge there ?
where it sticks out above your belt ?
and you can' t get rid of it , no matter what .
so gross .
that' s awesome .
what' s up ?
you suck .
see you tonight , dear .
yeah .
you know , jared' s got the pole this week and the track record .
what' s that smell ?
that' s just your mom .
you could find other places to eat .
i' m sure there' s better restaurants in town .
no , you' re the best .
want more of these ?
no thanks .
all right , lock the door .
the radio has wholly taken over .
many of the cinema' s ...
what was that ?
i don' t know .
all scripts must now be vetted .
the casting of actors must be approved .
from now on ... the german people will only know what their fuhrer wants them to know .
propaganda brought us into power .
that' s a lot of flags .
this was made in germany , right ?
yeah .
propaganda will enable us to conquer the world .
in his early munich days , hitler had taken an old hindu symbol ... the hooked cross , the swastika , as the nazi symbol .
now he multiplies it a million times .
from the romans , he steals the standards ...
can you still buy nazi flags ?
sure , if you' re a nut .
from mussolini , he steals the fascist salute .
check it out .
fuhrer , command , we follow you .
the fuhrer is always right .
who' s that guy ?
that' s hitler , right ?
yeah . ... who fears the intellect and hates all intellectuals .
so into the flames are flung the works not only of german philosophers ... scientists , doctors , poets , playwrights , novelists ... but those of all the world .
students as well as storm troopers obey the fuhrer' s orders .
any culture except nazi kultur must be destroyed .
hey , how you doing ?
you guys must be out of school today .
yeah .
good for you .
i' il have you sign for me here .
that' s great .
thank you very much .
sweet .
it' s here .
at a vast meeting in berlin ...
mussolini thanks germany for her help in his brutal abyssinian war .
and the fuhrer replies . ;
oh , yeah , dude .
this is so awesome .
peace , " did hitler say ?
let' s check this shit out , man .
hell , yeah , dude .
sweet .
back up .
whoa , dude , that was awesome .
hey , eli !
what' s up , john ?
how' s it going ?
pretty good .
and you ?
good .
what are you doing ?
just taking pictures .
can i take a picture of you ?
nice .
i' il see you later .
you going to the concert tonight ?
no , my parents are being bitches .
all right .
see you .
hi , michelle .
glad you could make it .
please come in and sign in here , then come out .
there are a few things we can work on together .
first , if you want to just take this cart of books ... and you can reshelf it over there in the non fiction .
i' il be right here to help you if you need me .
i guess this is it .
we' re gonna die today .
yeah , i' ve never even kissed anybody .
have you ?
i don' t appreciate you putting signs out like that .
the next day , he called up his friend and has him put out another sign .
and she doesn' t see it .
and so he puts out another one .
like , right in front of her house , in front of her apartment thing .
tim campbell' s whorehouse has been shut down .
or " has been placed under new ownership by " whatever her name was .
he couldn' t cut it anymore .
all right , let' s see this .
so , we' il park here , right ?
we' il enter through the south entrance .
then we go past the trophy case and the medal case , enter through the language lab .
they don' t use it anymore , so nobody' il be there .
we' il gear up there , we' il hear the primary explosions ... go about here in the cafeteria , right ?
when that goes , we should be able to pick off kids ... as we traverse the east wing .
and then we have another explosion that should go off here in the gym ... and here in the auditorium .
at that time , there should be kids flushing out in all directions ... and we' il be able to pick them off , one by one .
after that , you' il hit your yellow line here , which is your plan b.
and you' il go up through mr. luce' s office and take care of that .
fuck !
while i go , on the red line , up through this hallway ... where we' il have the best targets , dumb ass jocks and shit .
because we' il have a fucking field day down there .
i mean , come on .
you' ve got your tec 9 and your rifle ... and i' ve got my shotty and my . 223 on my back .
and i got a couple pistols and a knife .
we have enough explosives to last us almost a day .
most importantly , have fun , man .
yeah , man .
what are you guys doing ?
get the fuck out and don' t come back .
some heavy shit' s going down .
hey , don' t go in there .
hey , you guys , don' t go in there .
something bad is gonna happen .
don' t go in there , okay ?
dude , what the fuck ?
don' t worry about it , it' s probably just slow .
let' s go to plan b.
are you sure you set it right ?
positive .
sir , don' t go in there !
trust me !
just don' t go in there , please .
don' t go in !
dad !
hey , you guys ...
what was that ?
sounded like bombs .
that' s fine .
no more homework , no teachers .
that' d be so cool .
that' d be nice .
hi .
what' s wrong ?
what the hell is wrong with you ?
okay , then be a bitch .
what a freak .
i think maybe everyone could bring ...
well , i don' t drink soda , but some people do ...
what was that ?
firecracker .
don' t worry about it .
it' il be okay .
come on , sit down .
let' s finish this .
okay now , we talked about what we' re gonna do ...
nate ?
come on , get up , nate .
here we go , let' s go .
come on , let' s go , now !
it sounds clear .
go !
down the hallway to the band room exit !
hey , mr. luce .
why are you doing this ?
eric , put the gun down .
i ain' t putting shit down !
put the gun down , we' il talk about this .
shut up !
dad !
the school' s on fire .
are you all right ?
yeah , what' s going on ?
i saw two guys come in the other side .
holy cow !
they had big black bags and camo gear on .
my god .
where did you go ?
i just ...
i' m sorry .
yeah , you did , and i should shoot you right now for it , you know i should .
but i think i just might let you live , maybe , because i want you to know this ... and the next kids that come up to you with their problems ... that they' re being picked on , you should listen to them ... no matter what twisted shit they say .
fuck .
anyway , mr. luce , whatever .
you know there' s others like us out there , too .
and they will kill you if you fuck with them like you did me and jared .
get out of here , before i change my mind .
go !
bitch .
so foul and fair a day i have not seen .
fuck !
oh , my god , there he is !
oh , shit !
hey , man .
i wouldn' t drink that .
you' il get herpes or something .
so how did you do ?
