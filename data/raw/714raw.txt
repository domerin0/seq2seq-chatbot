so i' m going on a date with polly .
all right !
where are you taking her ?
i don' t know .
some restaurant in the east village .
she left the address on my machine .
how could you let polly pick the restaurant ?
well , i had no choice .
she called me , like , seven times ... to confirm and then cancel and then confirm again .
why ?
what' s wrong with letting her pick the place ?
you' ve got irritable bowel syndrome , dude .
if she chose an ethnic restaurant , you' re gonna be running to the bathroom every five seconds .
oh , my god .
you' re right .
thank you .
you know , i doubt it' il get this far , but if she turns out to be easier than i thought , there' s something you need to know .
i' m not a virgin , sandy .
no , not technically , but times have changed since you were last single .
now , listen , when i' m making out with a girl for the first time ,
i like to give her a little spankin ' .
what ?
<i>nothing violent . </ i>
you just tap her real light right on the tushy and say ,
hey , i' m your daddy .
i' m your daddy .
<i>listen to me . </ i>
<i>what are you doing ? </ i>
i' m blotting the grease .
that' s the best part .
let me see that .
listen , don' t be shy .
it' s just a little tap .
it' s like saying , " boop , i' m your daddy .
i' m not gonna tap her .
brings ' em right back to childhood .
trust me , they' re putty in your hands after that .
i gotta tell you , i' m really excited about this .
really .
i feel like this could be one of those ... defining moments of my life or something , you know ?
yeah , i actually think it' s not gonna work out , but i' m pulling for you , reub .
just pray to god she doesn' t go ethnic .
the place didn' t sound ethnic .

so i try to manage that risk by avoiding danger ... and having a plan and knowing what my next move is , and i guess you don' t exactly live your life that way .
no , i do it ...
i do it a little differently .

we' re presenting to aflac on wednesday .
polly , can you hang on a second ?
just hang on one second .
no , i kinda have to go .
you better not be bonus hunting on me , reuben .
<i>bonus hunting ? </ i>

<i>[ reuben' s voice ] </ i>
<i>i met a real estate agent</ i> <i>named lisa kramer ... </ i> <i>who showed me an apartment, </ i> <i>which i rentedjust so</ i> <i>she' d go out with me . </ i>

can we please just focus for a second ?
i' m almost finished .
what' s next ?
polly' s career prospects .
risky .
she' s writing a children' s book where kids get maimed .
yeah , see , i think her lack of career is actually a positive ,
' cause she' d have more time to spend with the kids .
<i>[ sandy ] </ i>
<i>you' re skewing the numbers</ i> <i>in polly' s favor , reuben . </ i>
<i>why are we even doing this ? </ i>
because i' m confused , sandy .
i mean , my goddamn wife shows up on my doorstep ... wanting to get back together , polly' s freaking out .
i just wanna make sure i' m making the right decision .
<i>i don' t see how putting these two girls</ i> <i>in the riskmaster' s gonna help you</ i> <i>make up your mind . </ i>
mmm .
<i>interesting . </ i>
<i>what' s it say ? </ i>
polly .
polly ?
yeah .
no way .
you should just cut your losses and get back with lisa .
nah , i checked it , like , three times .
the program says she' s the safer choice .
whatever .
<i>by the way , dude, </ i> <i>is your health okay ? </ i>
i mean , you' re looking kind of thin .

## [ fanfare ]
so i know we haven' t been seeing each other that long , but i really feel like it' s time we take things to the next level , and i' d like you to consider moving in with me .
why don' t we just ...
why don' t we just move in together ?
oh , yeah .
we' re gonna have ourselves a tussle .
<i>[ chittering ] </ i>
hey , polly !
<i>oh , my god . </ i>
<i>rodolfo' s in your toiletry kit . ! </ i>
<i>did you know that ? </ i>
did you pack him , or did you ... did you ...
what what is this ?
i mean , why am i in your computer ... on your riskmaster thingy and ...
okay , you know what ?
i can explain this , polly .
well , no , it' s fascinating .
i learned a lot about myself .
i' ve learned that i have no career , i' m flaky , i like ethnic food .
polly , would you let me explain this ?
uh huh .
lisa came back , and i , you know , i' ve been trying to figure things out .
what are you figuring out , reuben ?
just about us and our future .
future ?
what are you talking about ?
what future ?
reuben , come on !
this is a fling , you know ?
come on .
what , did you think we were gonna get married ?
whoa !
maybe ...
i was gonna ask you to move in with me first .
oh , my god .
you expect me to move to the suburbs with you ?
reuben , are you insane ?
whoa !
why is that so crazy ?
people do that all the time .
they have kids , they they they make plans , they get married , they buy houses .
you know what , though ?
that' s you , reuben .
you do that , right ?
that' s what you do .
i don' t live my life that way .
is your lack of a plan that different than my plan ?
i don' t ...
i don' t have a plan .
yes , you do !
you' re on the non plan plan .
i am not on a non plan plan !
you are too !
i' ve never met anybody more afraid of committing to anything .
i mean , you were a senior delegate at the model u. n. , polly .
what the hell happened to you ?
whoa !
wahoo !
come on , you mother !
you can do better than that !
i' ve been living my life , okay ?
<i>i' ve been in good relationships</ i> <i>and i' ve been in shitty ones, </ i> and i' ve moved a lot , and i' ve been happy and i' ve been sad , and i' ve been lonely , and that' s what i' ve been doing , <i>which is a lot more than i can say</ i> <i>for some freak who thinks ... </ i> he' s gonna get the ebola virus from a bowl of mixed nuts .
those nuts have pee on them !
it' s common sense !
oh , trust me , that is so far beyond common sense , reuben .
<i>you don' t understand</ i> <i>what i grew up with . </ i>
i had a mother who made me afraid of everything .
okay , well , big deal , reuben .
my dad had a whole second family .
what ?
yeah , on long island .
<i>a wife and kids</ i> <i>and a golden retriever . </ i>
a second family ?
whatever .
hey , you know what ?
i' m , uh , glad i saw that .
polly ...
<i>i am . </ i>
<i>' cause you know what ? </ i>
i' m gonna make this really , uh , easy for you , reuben .
i have , um ...
i have no interest ... <i>in getting married</ i> <i>and moving to the suburbs . </ i>
and , obviously , that' s something that' s really important to you .
so here' s what i think your new plan should be .
i think you should get back together with lisa , <i>move into your house, </ i> <i>and move on with your life . </ i>
and and , uh , i think you guys will be really happy together .
oh , dear lord .
whoa !
<i>[ reuben ] </ i>
<i>you' re not making myjob</ i> <i>any easier , leland . </ i>
<i>ah , come on , reub . </ i>

<i>[ wonsuk ] </ i>
<i>judas is biting me . ! </ i>
what just happened in there ?
i am a professional , reuben , and i' m not gonna put my reputation on the line for a group of freaking amateurs .
<i>[ irving ] </ i>
<i>it' s always the same story</ i> <i>with you , huh , pal ? </ i>
you did this one movie a hundred years ago .
from then on , you thought you were better than everybody else .
why don' t you let go ?
move on with your life .
it' s not about what happened in the past ... or what you think might happen in the future .
it' s about the ride , for christ' s sake .
there' s no point going through all this crap ... if you' re not gonna enjoy the ride .
and you know what ?
when you least expect it , <i>something great might come along</ i> ... <i>something better</ i> <i>than you even planned for . </ i>
you were funny as hell playing those bagpipes , though .
did i ever tell you that ?
l i don' t think i' ve ever heard you speak before , mr. feffer .
<i>so , reuby , we' re gonna grab a bite</ i> <i>after your work thingamajigy ? </ i>
no , lisa .
i shouldn' t have asked you to come down here .
i' m not getting back together with you .
what are you talking about ?
w why ?
<i>why ? </ i>
you screwed a scuba diving instructor on our honeymoon .
<i>i mean , what kind</ i> <i>of cold , heartless bitch ... </ i> would do that to someone they love ?
i' d have to be an idiot to get back together with you after that .
oh , and by the way , i destroyed all your little throw pillows .
yeah , because throw pillows suck , okay ?
they serve no purpose .
they' re purely decorative .
dude , that was incredible .
you' re the one who told me i should get back together with her .
reuben .
whatever you do , don' t ever take my advice again .
your dad totally put it in perspective for me .
i was barely famous back then , and i' m never gonna be famous again .
what about your <i>e . !
true hollywood story ? </ i>
the e !
channel doesn' t even know we' re making this show .
what do you mean ?
i hired dustin and vic myself .
<i>and i was gonna try and sell it</ i> <i>to the network when i' m done . </ i>
you mean you' re doing an <i>e . !
true hollywood story</ i> on yourself ?
sandy , that' s so ...
that' s the stupidest thing i' ve ever heard .
i know .
i' m such a loser .
look , i need you to do something for me that' s really , really important .
so you gotta promise me just this one time you won' t screw it up .
reuben , i' m your wingman .
whatever it is , i will not let you down .
your reuben' s proxy ?
what the hell does that mean ?
now , he' s dealing with a personal situation , so he asked me to fill in .
now , you gotta relax .
i' m a professional actor , and these dudes will never know the difference .
i can' t freaking believe this is happening .
be quiet , ' cause i' m ... tryin ' to prepare .
i' m gonna vomit .
i am so sorry for the delay , folks , but one of our senior analysts , reuben feffer , had his spleen burst just a few moments ago , and ...
that' s not good .
is he gonna be all right ?
<i>well , god willing , leland . </ i>
but anyway , be that as it may , we have mr. feffer' s associate here , mr. sanford lyle , <i>who' s been briefed on the case</ i> <i>and will present reuben' s recommendations . </ i>
thank you , stanley .
i just need a little bit of water .
as you know , this is a highly complex case .
um , let me see here .
yeah , on the plus side ,
leland' s blood pressure is pretty solid .
and he' s , uh , at a decent weight , and he looks pretty damn healthy , right ?
<i>and he' s a sexy guy , right ? </ i>
and he is sexually active in the community .
polly ?
j. f. k. , please .
<i>[ rodolfo chittering ] </ i>
let' s not bullcrap each other .
<i>on paper , van lew is one of</ i> <i>the riskiest sons ofbitches alive . </ i>
<i>but , people, </ i> we cannot sum up a man' s life with a bunch of numbers on a computer screen .
all right , we all need to look into our hearts and go ,
do i think this dude is gonna die in a few years or not ?
is old leland here gonna fight off a man ... with the last name " reaper , " first name ... who goes by the last name " reaper , " first name " grim " ?
<i>or will this base jumping, </ i> crocodile wrestling , shark diving , volcano luging , <i>bear fighting, </ i> <i>snake wrangling, </ i> <i>motocross racing bastard die ? </ i>
<i>and the answer is no , friends, </ i> <i>which is why myself, </ i>
reuben feffer , stan ... <i>and all of us here</ i> <i>at indurby and friends ... </ i> <i>are willing to lay our asses</ i> <i>on the line ... </ i> and proudly recommend that leland van lew ... receive fifty million dollars in life and health ... and automobile insurance ... for a duration of no less than 20 years .
hey , what do you think , guys ?
are you that kid from <i>crocodile tears ? </ i>
you' re goddamn right i am .

he' s insured .

bloody ripper !

<i>love ya , son . ! </ i>
<i>[ polly ] </ i>
<i>rodolfo , wait . ! </ i>
i' m so sorry !
<i>[ beeping intensifies ] </ i>
reuben , it' s too late .
i have to be on a plane in , like , 45 minutes .
i don' t think you really wanna leave here .
you have no idea what i want .
you left rodolfo behind .
does that mean anything to you ?
look , i made a mistake , all right ?
i should' ve never put you in the riskmaster .
truth is , no matter what happened on our honeymoon , you' re much riskier than lisa could ever be .
yes .
right .
that' s why it' s not gonna work out between us .
reuben , you are a nice , safe , conventional guy .
just ...
it' s not gonna work out .
i don' t think that' s who i really am .
it is , reuben .
that' s okay .
what do i have to do to prove it to you ?
huh ?
hey !
huh ?
what are you ...
oh , my god .
hey , look .
look , i' m eating nuts .
what the hell are you doing ?
those nuts aren' t even dirty .
hey .
oh !
since we' ve been together , i' ve felt more uncomfortable , out of place , embarrassed ... and just physically sick than i have in my entire life .
<i>but i couldn' t have</ i> <i>gone through all that</ i> ...
i couldn' t have thrown up 19 times in 48 days ... if i wasn' t in love with you .
<i>maybe you were right . </ i>
<i>maybe this is just a fling . </ i>
but if you get on that plane and you go to cincinnati ... or tanzania or wherever you' re going , we' il never know if it could' ve been something more .
oh , no .
no , no , no .
no .
oh , no .
n no .
oh , reuben .
please don' t eat those .
<i>no , really . </ i>
