hey , sheriff .
a mercury is a real good car .
that was the car i was driving that day .
i owned a lot of cars .
yeah , different kinds .
a lot of different kinds of cars .
she was standing , this girl ... on the side of the street by this chicken stand .
not the colonel' s , a different chicken stand .
i pulled the mercury up alongside ... and rolled down the window by electric power .
and she had this leather skirt on ... and she had a lot of hair on her arms .
i like that .
it means a big bush , which i like .
she says , " are you dating ?
you know ?
i said , " sure .
so she gets in ... and we pull off into ... this remote location comfortable for both of us .
she says , " how much do you want to spend ?
i said , " enough to see your bush .
i know it' s big .
she says , " $25 .
that' s not chicken feed to a working man .
i produce the $25 , she sticks it in her shoe ... pulls up her skirt ... and there is thin , crooked , uncircumcised penis .
you can imagine i wanted my $25 back .
why are you weirded out ?
it' s not san quentin .
it' s a nut house .
most patients don' t know where they are .
they won' t hurt you .
it doesn' t bother you we' il be facing a killer in a few minutes ?
you wanted to major in journalism .
they' re from that newspaper deal .
from the college ?
yes , sir .
i' m jerry woolridge .
i' m marsha dwiggins .
she' s theresa evans .
she' s here to take pictures .
y' all sit down .
a man named john leggitt hunter had a filling station .
a good filling station business .
he was the type of person that i' m sure you' ve met too ... who didn' t deserve what he had .
one thing he had was ... this beautiful , young bride , sarah .
she was a georgia peach .
she was more like the picture i had in my mind than any woman i' d seen .
so i took her away from john leggitt hunter ... who did not deserve her .
oh , i don' t know if i told you ... but he was a frenchman who claimed to be an englishman .
took strong nylon cord to get her away from him .
she was a fighter and a georgia peach .
there must have been a mix up .
i talked to your sponsor , teacher or whoever ... and told him no pictures .
this is for an article or something , right ?
yeah , it' s for the school newspaper which has pictures .
it' s a regular paper .
karl' s real sensitive about having his picture made .
he wouldn' t be on the bulletin board for the easter collage .
now ... a shovel just makes too goddamn much racket .
i' il talk to him , see what he says .
you gotta make something explode to truly understand it .
you gotta examine all those particles while they' re still on fire .
karl , let' s go down to the old classroom .
mr. woolridge has some people for you to see .
let' s go .
remember i told you about those newspaper people ?
they want to ask you questions about your release .
they think it' il make a good story .
will you talk to them ?
get interviewed ?
they' re women .
i think it' d be good for you .
you' il see all kinds of people on the outside .
this' il help .
now , he' il only talk to you but you can' t ask him anything ... and don' t stare at him .
how can i interview him if i can' t ask any questions ?
sorry , that' s the best it' s gonna get .
can i ask you a question ?
if he' s so troubled , why are you letting him out ?
what if he does it again ?
it happens .
his time' s up .
that' s the rules .
he' s been treated , reevaluated , doesn' t show any signs anymore .
signs ?
homicidal signs .
miss , i' m sorry , but you' il have to step outside .
why ?
please ?
i have to change the light in here for karl .
i hope you can still see to write .
i reckon what you want to know is what i' m doing in here .
i reckon it' s because i killed somebody .
but i reckon you want to know how come i killed somebody ... so i' il start at the front and tell you .
i lived out in back of my parents ' place most of my life ... in a little old shed that my daddy' d built for me .
they didn' t want me in the house with the rest of them ... so i sat around in the shed looking at the ground .
i didn' t have no floor ... but i had me a hole dug out to lay down in ... a quilt or two to put down there .
my father ... was a hardworking man most of his life ... not that i can say the same for myself .
i mostly just sat around in the shed ... tinkered around with a lawn mower or two ... went to school off and on from time to time .
but the children out there , they were very cruel to me ... and made quite a bit of sport of me , made fun of me quite a bit .
so mostly i just sat around out there in the shed .
my daddy ... worked at the sawmill , down at the planer mill ... for an old man named dixon .
old man dixon was a very cruel fellow .
didn' t treat his employees well or pay them well .
didn' t pay my daddy too much of a wage .
just barely enough to get by , i reckon .
i reckon he got by all right .
they used to come out , one or the other of them ... usually my mother ... feed me pretty regular .
so i know he made enough so i could have mustard and biscuits ... three or four times a week .
but old man dixon ... he had a boy ... name of jesse dixon .
jesse was more cruel than his daddy was .
he used to make quite a bit of sport of me ... when i was down there at the schoolhouse .
used to take advantage of the girls in the neighborhood .
they used to say ... that my mother was a very pretty woman .
they said that quite a bit when i' d be there at the schoolhouse .
i reckon you want me to get on with it and tell you what happened .
so i reckon i' il tell you .
i was setting out in the shed one evening , not doing much ... just staring at the wall ... and waiting on my mother to give me my bible lesson .
i heard a commotion in the house ... so i run up on the screened in porch to look inside .
i looked in and seen my mother laying on the floor without any clothes on .
i seen jesse dixon laying on top of her .
he was having his way with her .
i just seen red .
i picked up a kaiser blade that was sitting by the door .
some folks called it a sling blade .
i called it a kaiser blade .
it' s got a long , wood handle , kind of like an ax handle ... with a long blade shaped like a banana .
sharp on one edge and dull on the other .
it' s what the highway boys use to cut down weeds and whatnot .
yeah .
i went in the house ... and i hit jesse dixon upside the head with it ... knocked him off my mother .
i reckon that didn' t satisfy me ... so i hit him again in the neck with the sharp edge ... and just plumb near cut his head off , killed him .
my mother jumped up and started hollering ...
what did you kill jesse for ?
well , come to find out ... my mother didn' t mind what jesse was doing to her .
that made me madder than what jesse' d made me ... so i took the kaiser blade some folks called it a sling blade , i called it a kaiser blade and i hit my mother upside the head with it .
killed her .
some folks asked me : if you had it to do over again , would you do it the same way ?
i reckon i would .
anyhow , they put me in here ... and here i been for a great , long while .
i' ve learned to read some .
took me four years to read the bible .
i reckon i understand a great deal of it .
wasn' t what i expected in some places .
i' ve slept in a good bed for a great , long while .
now they' ve seen fit to put me out of here .
they say they' re setting me free today .
i reckon that' s all you was needing to know .
you want more details .
i reckon i can tell them .
i don' t know whether that' s enough for your newspaper or not .
will you ever kill again , karl ?
i don' t reckon i got no reason to kill nobody .
where will he go ?
anywhere he wants .
i think he' s going to millsburg where he' s from , about 20 miles from here .
will he be supervised ?
as much as anybody , i guess .
y' all have a nice day , now .
i' il get melvin to walk y' all out .
would you walk these girls out ?
thank you .
i reckon i' il have to get used to looking at pretty people .
guess you will .
reckon i' il have to get used to them looking at me too .
better go get your things .
ain' t got nothing but them books .
better go get them .
all right , then .
all right , then .
can i help you ?
i was kinda wanting something to eat .
well , what would you like ?
you got any biscuits in there ?
no , this is a frosty cream .
we don' t serve biscuits .
we got a lot of other stuff .
what you got in there that' s good to eat ?
we got big chief burgers , bongo burgers ...
foot longs , corny dogs , frosty shakes , creamy bars .
did you want me to go through the whole list ?
what do you like ?
well , the french fries are pretty good .
french fried potatoes ?
yep , french fries .
how much you want for them ?
they' re 60 for medium and 75 for large .
i reckon i' il have me some of the big ones .
all right .
one large french fries ?
these darn things are heavy .
hard to carry too .
you got wash in there ?
yeah .
can' t your mama and daddy tend to it ?
i got a mama but she' s at work at hoochy' s dollar store .
my daddy' s dead .
he got hit by a train .
how far you going with them sacks full of wash ?
half a mile , i think .
i can help you tote it if i don' t give out first .
okay , but you don' t have to .
all right , then .
my name' s frank wheatley .
what' s yours ?
karl' s my name .
what' s your last name ?
childers .
what are all them books ?
oh , different ones .
one' s the bible , one' s a book on christmas ... one' s on how to be a carpenter .
why do you carry them around ?
ain' t got no place to set them down .
don' t you live somewhere ?
did live at the state hospital .
why ?
i killed some folks a while back .
they said i wasn' t right in the head so they put me in the nervous hospital ... instead of putting me in jail .
they let you out ?
yeah .
how come ?
they told me i was well .
had to turn me loose .
are you well ?
i reckon i feel all right .
this here' s my house .
you don' t seem like you killed nobody .
we can just set these bags on the porch .
all right , then .
you like to play football ?
i never was no account at it , never got picked out for it .
me and the barnett twins and some boys ... play at the junior high school field all the time .
you want to play , come on over ' cause we ain' t no good either .
i' il see you later .
all right , then .
hon , you can' t just go in there .
what in the world are you doing here ?
i want to come back and stay in here .
you can' t .
you' re a free man .
they let you out so you can do as you please .
i reckon i don' t care about being a free man .
i don' t know how to go about it .
you' il have to learn .
it' il take some time .
don' t you have anybody to help you out ?
no , sir .
your daddy was living there last time i heard .
i guess he wouldn' t want to help you out any , would he ?
sorry .
i wasn' t thinking .
don' t you have anybody ?
no , sir .
never did know too much of nobody down there .
not to be helping me out , no way .
karl , the truth is ...
i don' t know where they expect you to go , what they expect you to do .
if i could , i' d let you come back here and stay if you wanted to .
i' m just doing my job .
you follow me ?
listen , karl , i know an old boy ... who' s got a fix it shop deal in millsburg .
he used to go to church with me .
you' re good working on small engines and things .
if i was to put my neck out for you with him ... do you think you could work it if he' il hire you ?
i' m pretty handy , i reckon , on lawn mowers and whatnot .
i know you are .
i' ve seen it myself .
could you give it a try ?
i reckon .
now i can' t promise that he' il hire you .
i' il have to tell him about your history .
i never was no good with history .
no .
i mean your past .
why you were in here .
take you down first thing in the morning .
you don' t have anywhere to stay tonight at all ?
no , sir .
it' s against the rules for you to stay here .
if something happened , i' d be liable .
i reckon i can walk around till morning time , sit and read a book .
karl , would you like a muffin ?
no , thank you .
so jerry' s taking you someplace else tomorrow .
i don' t know nobody named jerry .
that' s me , karl .
that' s my first name .
he' s carrying me to look for work down in millsburg ... where i was born .
would you like some coffee ?
coffee makes me a mite nervous when i drink it .
daddy , can i go to bed ?
sure .
you sleep with your mama tonight .
i' m sleeping with your brother so karl can have your room .
why ?
because he' s company .
karl , you up ?
yes , sir .
didn' t you sleep ?
you been sitting there like that all night ?
yes , sir .
come on .
we' d better hit the road .
all right , then .
jerry , how' s it going ?
hey , bill .
good to see you .
good to see you .
how' s everyone doing ?
pretty good .
kids are driving me crazy , and phyliss is putting me in the poor house ... but i can' t complain otherwise .
wouldn' t do any good anyway .
you know scooter ?
don' t believe i do .
good to meet you , scooter .
how about you ?
well , this is the one i was telling you about on the phone .
if you get nervous , i' il understand , but i' m not going to lie to you .
he got into that trouble , but he was young .
i remember .
he cut them to pieces , and one was his mama .
and that dixon boy .
hell , i always wanted to kill him .
he was an asshole .
i remember him too .
kinda retarded or something back in school .
seems like he' s pretty well adjusted these days .
i don' t think he' d ever hurt anybody .
he don' t look much like he would .
and he can fix a small engine real good ?
he' s a whiz .
it' s all he' s done since he was a kid .
you scared of him , scooter ?
no , i don' t guess so .
can he talk ?
oh , yeah .
you say he can stay out in the back ?
fine with me .
if he steals anything ...
i' il take it out of your pocket .
he won' t steal .
he' s a good old boy .
keeps to himself .
i got a room full of work .
scooter won' t do it .
karl , come over here .
i want you to meet your new boss .
this is bill cox .
he runs the place .
says you can work here , stay out back .
it' s good to know you , karl .
thank you .
it' s minimum wage .
there' s nothing back there but an army cot and a toilet .
that' s fine .
i' il go to the car and get your books .
all right , then .
they say you' re a whiz on fixing lawn mowers and things .
i' ve tinkered around on them a bit .
we order from the frosty cream at lunch , usually .
we' il buy you lunch till you get on your feet .
i like them french fried potatoes .
yeah .
me too .
they make a good double meat burger .
all right , then .
i' il see y' all later .
karl , you done good work .
they was right about you .
scooter , he' s gonna knock you out of a job if you' re not careful .
i' il see y' all tomorrow .
wait up .
i' il leave with you and lock up .
there' s a blanket under the cot , soap in the bathroom for cleaning up .
one more thing .
the way we lock these doors , you can' t get out at night .
did you want to go anywhere ?
i don' t reckon .
if it works out , we' il get you a key so you can get out at night .
i' il see you later .
all right , then .
did i tell you the one about the two old boys pissing off the bridge ?
i don' t remember .
these two old boys hung their peckers off a bridge to piss .
one was from california , one from arkansas .
old boy from california says , " boy , this water' s cold .
old boy from arkansas says , " yeah , and it' s deep too .
get it ?
yeah , that' s a good one .
that is a good one .
i do believe you told me that before .
i' ve heard it a bunch .
a long time ago .
yeah , that' s a classic .
karl , i' ve been thinking , and it' s not christian of me to keep locking you in .
you' ve been in lockup so long , you don' t need me to keep doing it .
you need to come and go as you please .
here .
take this key .
it' il get you in and out of here at night .
all right , then .
them french fries good ?
they' s good , all right .
you got any money ?
they give me some when they turned me loose .
i spent some riding the bus , eating french fried potatoes .
i' m going to pay you today for this coming week ... so you have some walking around money .
you need to buy some toothpaste and cleaning up supplies to have back there .
get you some magazines and some hard candy ... something to keep you busy at night .
all right , then .
i' il let you off while it' s still daylight .
i thought i heard somebody on the porch .
wasn' t your name karl ?
yes , sir , it is .
you' re named frank .
yeah .
what are you doing by here ?
you said for me to come by .
wanna play ball with us ?
i ain' t no good at it .
i just come by to see you .
i was going to see my mama at hoochy' s dollar store .
she works 2 : 00 to 8 : 00 .
all right , then .
you want to go with me ?
you can meet my mama .
i ought not worry your mama with company .
come on .
you' il like her .
she' s real nice .
she' il give us anything we want her to , candy or something .
i was needing to do some trading .
reckon they sell toothpaste ?
yeah , they sell a little bit of everything .
i won' t tell her about you being in the state hospital for killing .
come on .
let' s go .
you have to learn to live without all that grease .
here in the south , i like grease in everything .
i like fried chicken , fried okra , biscuits and gravy .
it will kill you .
hey , mama , vaughan .
what you up to , sweetheart ?
i bet i know .
you want candy and pop , right ?
yeah .
that rots your teeth .
i' ve got something better .
potted meat is on special four cans for a dollar .
they' re not selling but i' il give the right kid some for free .
i don' t like potted meat .
daddy said it was made from lips , peckers and intestines .
don' t talk that way .
did that strange looking man follow you in here ?
can i help you ?
that' s karl .
i met him at the laundry mat .
karl , this is mama and vaughan .
vaughan is the manager .
he lets mama off work anytime because they' re best friends .
nice to meet you , karl .
pleased to meet you .
frank , come back here with me for a minute .
i haven' t seen you here before .
no , sir , i don' t reckon you have .
i haven' t been in here before .
this store didn' t used to be here .
it' s been here 17 years .
did you live here before ?
i was born and raised here till i was 12 years old .
what brings you back ?
what' s that you say ?
why are you here now ?
they turned me loose from the state hospital .
is that right ?
how long are you staying ?
mr. woolridge got me hired at bill cox' s outfit .
you have family here ?
not to speak of .
hey , karl .
guess what ?
mama said you can stay in our garage .
our car doesn' t fit anyway .
it' s real neat .
frank told me about your situation .
frank loves company .
especially after his daddy passed and all .
there' s no sense in you staying in that greasy old shop .
he' s mentally retarded , poor thing .
he just go out of the state hospital .
i know .
can we get some candy and pop ?
sure .
go ahead .
come on .
is it safe to let him around that guy ?
frank' s crazy about him .
he likes the way he talks and he helped frank carry home the laundry .
he' s been in the hospital a long time .
there must be something wrong with him .
he' s retarded .
frank' s always after a father figure .
lord knows doyle ain' t a good one with his mean ass .
what about me ?
he doesn' t see you as a " guy " guy .
karl' s a " guy " guy ?
i call this my secret place .
i come out here when i feel like being alone .
i used to come here with karen cross .
she kind of used to be my girlfriend .
we would come out here and hold hands and talk ... and read books to each other with a flashlight .
she wouldn' t have nothing to do with me in front of other people ... because mama and i don' t have any money .
her daddy' s a dentist , so they' re rich .
was your folks well off ?
no , we barely had enough to scrape by on , i reckon .
your folks still around ?
my mother' s dead .
my daddy' s still around but he don' t want to have nothing to do with me .
how do you know ?
he never did want to .
i figure he probably ain' t changed his mind much .
how' d your mama die ?
you don' t need to hear things like that .
you just a boy .
you need to think good thoughts while you still a boy .
there' s lots of time for all the other .
i had bad thoughts since daddy died .
sometimes i wish i was still little and he was still here .
mama' s real good , but i wish i had both of them .
we went to memphis in the car once .
it was raining so hard we couldn' t see the road ... but i wasn' t scared because as long as daddy was driving ... nothing could happen to us .
that' s the way i feel about mama now .
mama has a boyfriend now .
his name is doyle hargraves .
he works construction so he makes a pretty good living ... but he don' t help mama out with any money .
he ain' t no good .
he' s mean to her .
he don' t like me at all .
mama says he' s jealous because i belong to my daddy .
he spends the night at our house and he' s got his own house .
somebody told me this way he can have more girlfriends .
i like the nights he' s not there .
i ain' t so nervous then .
how come she' s still being girlfriends with him if he' s mean to her ?
she says it' s for the times he' s good to her .
she' s lonely since daddy died .
sometimes she don' t know why .
he threatened to kill her if she left him .
my daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama .
vaughan' s real good to mama .
vaughan that you met ?
but he' s not able to do anything to doyle .
he' s funny .
not " funny , " ha ha .
funny , " queer .
he likes to go with men .
that makes him not able to fight good , but he sure is nice .
he' s from st. louis .
queer people get along better in a big town .
i wish he like to go with women .
i' d rather him be mama' s boyfriend than doyle .
karl , remember i told you daddy got hit by a train ?
yes , sir , i recollect that .
it ain' t the truth .
he shot himself with a shotgun on purpose .
how come him do that ?
because he didn' t have enough money to take care of us like he wanted to .
that' s what the letter said .
he got laid off of work and did odd jobs .
i thought he took care of us just fine .
karl , did you really kill somebody ?
yes , sir , i did .
who' d you kill ?
two people .
were they bad people ?
i thought they was .
maybe they needed it .
i growed up and learned that you ain' t supposed to kill nobody .
it' s okay if you' re protecting yourself , if it' s self defense .
was it self defense ?
my daddy was good .
i think too many good people die .
that' s what i think .
you sure you wanna stay with these folks ?
you' re welcome to stay here .
it' s working out good .
that boy wants me to .
all right , then .
i' il see you bright and early .
how' s that garden tiller coming ?
i fixed it .
it' s working pretty good now .
you done fixed it ?
i' il be damned .
scooter told me it couldn' t be fixed .
of course , scooter' s about as shiftless as one poor son of a bitch can be .
you done fixed it .
well , i' il just be damned .
i' il see you tomorrow .
all right , then .
i don' t guess i' il give a shit , then .
i ain' t here that much .
if you want a retard living in your garage , that' s your business .
i do got some tools i' d rather not have stoled .
i could take those home with me .
he' s real honest .
he wouldn' t steal nothing .
frankie , i wasn' t talking to you , was l ?
no , sir .
" no , sir " is right .
i was talking to your mama .
it' s her decision , not yours .
if i let it go on , it' s because she asked me , not you .
does this retard drool and rub shit in his hair and all that ?
i' m going to have a hard time eating around that kind of thing .
just like with antique furniture and midgets .
i can' t so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or an antique .
doyle , you' re awful .
you shouldn' t be that way .
i ain' t saying it' s right .
it' s just the truth .
he' il make me sick .
what was he in the nut house for ?
he' s just retarded , i guess .
no , he had of gone nuts and did something .
a lot of retards running around that ain' t locked up in the nut house .
think about it , linda .
you know what he done , frank ?
i ain' t sure .
you oughta want to find out .
he might have hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or something .
frank , you' d better ask him .
don' t hurt his feelings , but it would be good to know .
i' m sure it' s nothing .
he seems sweet .
you' re all hung up on people being sweet .
he' s sweet .
everybody' s sweet .
speaking of sweet , where' s your girlfriend ?
i thought he was coming over .
he' il be here in a while .
we' re going for ice cream .
now ain' t that sweet .
what do i do about supper while you' re running around with that fag ?
you' re not crippled .
go make something .
talking back and everything , aren' t you ?
that makes me horny .
frank , go and play in your room , if doyle' s going to talk nasty .
i don' t want to go play .
he don' t want to .
let him stay .
let' s be a family till your mentally retarded and homosexual friends arrive .
yes , sir ?
you' re really going to stay here .
that boy wants me to .
have you knocked yet ?
no , sir , i ain' t .
how long have you been here ?
quite a spell , i reckon .
before you get used to staying here , we need to talk about a few things .
can i take you to lunch ?
i done ate a little bit ago .
i mean tomorrow or the next day .
i reckon i could eat something at noontime .
bill cox generally gets me a box lunch ... but i reckon he can lay off doing it tomorrow .
then i' il come by and pick you up around noon , all right ?
all right , then .
there' s your girlfriend .
y' all come on in .
come on .
have a seat in here .
hey , vaughan .
how are you , karl ?
tolerable , i reckon .
karl , this is doyle .
frank , you and karl go fix him up a place in the garage .
vaughan , you ready to go ?
sure .
honey , don' t rush everybody off .
you and karl want to go with us ?
i don' t want to .
we got things we need to do .
vaughan , you know what i heard ?
that you been putting it on albert sellers over at the funeral home .
i know albert .
we' re friends .
i heard you was more than friends .
i heard dick rivers caught you two going at it in the same room ... with poor old mrs. ogletree and her dead as a doornail laid out on a gurney .
that' s ridiculous , a total lie .
let' s go , vaughan .
we' il be back in a while .
i' il bring you something .
your food' s in the oven warming over .
you fixed him something .
vaughan , i was just going on with you .
just joking around .
you know , buddy .
i know .
you' re a real card .
karl , come over , sit down and talk to me .
come on , karl .
let' s go to the garage .
goddammit .
i want to talk to him .
sit down , karl .
what' s in your bag ?
this and that .
toothpaste and whatnot .
what' s all them books ?
different ones .
one of them' s the bible .
you believe in the bible , karl ?
yes , sir .
a good deal of it .
i can' t understand all of it .
i can' t understand none of it .
this one begat that one , that one begat this one ... and begat and begat and lo and behold someone says some shit to someone .
how retarded are you ?
stop it , doyle .
frankie , be quiet .
we' re talking .
the adults are talking .
was you in lockup for cutting someone with a hatchet or something ?
i ain' t never used no hatchet that i remember .
so you' re just crazy in a retard kind of way then ?
it wouldn' t matter to me if you did do violence .
i ain' t scared of shit .
you think i' m scared for you to stay here ?
you just a humped over retard .
i' m just kidding you .
welcome to our humble home , buddy .
frank needs all the friends he can get .
frank' s a weak little kid .
his daddy taught him how to be a pussy .
don' t talk about my daddy .
go on out to the garage .
leave me be .
go on .
come on , karl .
don' t say nothing about our little spat to your mama .
i don' t want her worrying .
i' d like to kill that son of a bitch .
i hate him .
you ought not talk that away .
you just a boy .
well , i hate him .
he ought not talk that away to you neither .
he ain' t no account .
he' s mean to you and your mama .
your mama and that fellow that' s carrying me to get something to eat' s ... going to be back directly .
will you be here with us for a long time ?
i reckon , if you want me to .
i got some of that potted meat and soda crackers if you want some .
how can you eat all that stuff with them insides it' s made out of ?
i reckon it tastes pretty good to me .
i like the way you talk .
well , i like the way you talk .
you think it' s really got peckers in there ?
you know better than to say that word .
it smells kinda funny .
it' s a little loud .
looky right here .
i believe you right .
i believe i see one in there .
thank you , sir .
mister , could you hand me that mustard over there ?
thank you .
okay , karl .
the reason that i ... brought you here is ... to talk about something that' s on my mind .
i' m just going to put it right out on the table .
where do i start ?
linda and frank are very important to me .
they' re like family .
my own family was never like a family .
they' re horrible people .
as a matter of fact ... for years i prayed every night that my father would die ... and finally realized , through a lot of therapy ...
i was wasting my energy on hating him .
so now i just don' t care .
but you see , you and i are a lot alike ... as strange as that may seem .
i don' t mean physically or even mentally , really ... but emotionally .
actually , the hand we' ve been dealt in life
we' re different .
people see us as being different , anyway .
you' re you' ve got ... your affliction or whatever and l
well , mine' s not as easy to see .
i' m just going to say it .
i' m gay .
does that surprise you ?
that i' m gay ?
you know what " gay " is , don' t you ?
i don' t reckon .
homosexual .
i like men .
sexually .
not " funny , " ha ha .
funny , " queer .
that' s an offensive way to put it .
you shouldn' t say that .
you were taught that , weren' t you ?
i' ve heard it said that away , yes , sir .
anyway , it' s hard to live gay that' s the right way to say it in a small town like this .
i' ve wanted to leave many times , but ... because i love ...
linda , frank and ... a certain other person
they' ve kept me here .
anyway , i' m rambling .
if you' re going to live in the wheatley garage ... you need to know it' s not going to be easy .
doyle is a monster .
not just a closed minded redneck , but a monster , a dangerous person .
i' ve told linda that one day that man is going to hurt her and that boy ... maybe even kill them .
i see it in his eyes .
i' m very in tune , even psychic .
but doyle is going to make your life hell .
there' s one more thing .
it' s none of my business why you were in the state hospital .
everybody has something in their past .
maybe ... you tried suicide .
maybe you did something terrible .
but what i see before me ... is a gentle ... simple man .
all i want you to promise me ... is that you are capable of being around frank and linda .
you know .
you would never ... hurt either of them for any reason , would you ?
i would never hurt them .
that' s what i thought .
i' m sorry if i' ve offended you in any way .
you seem like a thinker , you know .
you seem to always be deep in thought .
what are you thinking right now ?
i was thinking i might wanna take some of these potatoes home with me .
how about before that ?
let me think .
before that , i was thinking ...
i could use me six or eight cans of that potted meat ... if you got any extra .
frankie , get some of this salad .
hold your plate up for me .
i' m just gonna reach .
how come karl won' t eat in here with us ?
i don' t know .
he said he' d eat out there .
i wouldn' t let it get to you .
put some dressing on there .
yes .
i just feel sorry for the poor thing .
who the hell could eat with him making all that racket in his throat ?
he does make some funny noises .
i like the way he talks .
sounds like a race car motor idling .
makes me not be nervous .
i' m glad of it .
what have you got to be nervous about ?
you' re a kid .
you got no bills to pay , no business to run .
you don' t even have to have a job .
you got no old lady on your ass at all .
i don' t know .
i just stay nervous .
could i have some of that ham ?
yeah .
i' m sorry .
thank you .
you know what , by god ?
what ?
i know what i ought to do tonight .
please , don' t .
i' m gonna call up morris and get the band together .
we' re gonna party our asses off .
i' d love to show them karl .
they' d get a kick out of him .
not tonight .
i' m not up for it .
they always stay till morning .
i' il just give out .
you don' t gotta do nothing .
just put chips in a bowl ... and run ice out to us when we get low .
last time , you got mad and run morris and them off and told them to stay away .
that ain' t none of your business .
besides , that' s the way friends are .
fuck .
i' m calling them up .
linda , go into the garage and get my guitar .
it' s out there with that looney toon .
now ?
yeah , now .
i' m calling them up .
morris , what you doing , boy ?
where' s randy and them ?
yeah , now .
please .
frankie , go help your mom .
when are we gonna eat ?
hang on .
eat when you come back .
get my guitar .
come on , sugar .
i wanna get together .
yeah .
call him .
one .
two .
one , two , three , four .
you gotta play through it .
wail on the gig , but you gotta play through it .
no , you play through  you like that , vaughan ?
sure .
it sounds like a number one hit tune .
karl , did you like that ?
i reckon .
i wish you' d all lay off for tonight !
i can' t think with that racket !
hey !
it' s nighttime .
hey !
i' m calling the police !
i told you already !
the law' s on my side !
i play cards with j. d. shelnut , chief of police !
so kiss my ass , you old bastard !
you and frank clean this mess up .
put the tarp over these instruments .
me and the boys are going to the county line .
we' re out of liquor .
karl , come with us .
vaughan , come on .
it' s late .
i have to work tomorrow .
don' t be a pussy .
we all gotta work tomorrow .
come on .
he don' t want to .
don' t go if you don' t want to .
you' il wreck , doyle .
you' re drunk .
i ain' t gonna wreck .
i' il be good .
i promise .
i love you , sweetie .
come on , karl .
go with us .
just trying to make these two feel like they' re part of it .
come on , vaughan .
this' il be fun .
karl , let' s go .
come on .
you gotta lay out on that tambourine .
i ain' t did nothing wrong .
hey !
ain' t anybody gonna come get me ?
i don' t understand what you are talking about .
exactly the point , my young friend .
i don' t get it .
i rest my case .
morris is real smart with philosophies and things .
that' s why him and me is the songwriting team of our group .
i come up with the good tunes , or melodies , as we call them ...
morris is the lyrics .
not unlike gary brooker of procol harum .
we don' t ever played songs y' all wrote .
i ain' t heard one of them .
y' all just talk .
we don' t play any songs with words at all .
we ain' t got no fucking microphone !
we ain' t got no speakers !
we wrote one last night outside the mini mart .
morris called it , " stuart drives a comfortable car .
then , like in country songs , in parenthesis it says ...
there' s usually someone in the trunk .
and i came up with a tune , just humming .
you don' t wanna question a genius , vaughan .
morris here' s a modern day poet .
kind of like in the olden times .
yeah , i got a new tune .
this composition' s entitled , " the thrill .
i stand on the hill , not for a thrill ... but for a breath of a fresh kill .
never mind the man who contemplates ... doing away with license plates .
he stands alone anyhow ... baking the cookies of discontent ... by the heat of the laundromat vent .
leaving his soul .
then , like in poetry , i go dot , dot , dot .
leaving his soul ... parting the waters of the medulla oblongata ... of ... mankind .
damn good song , wasn' t it ?
you like that song ?
all right .
i don' t think that' s right .
i believe the " dot , dot , dot " come between ...
medulla " and " oblongata .
well , it did .
the dots are where i say they are .
melody and tune .
that' s your trade , terence .
you' re a tunesmith .
i don' t understand the words .
y' all don' t shut up , i' m gonna go out of my mind .
besides , karl' s liable to bust his spring .
he' s already off balance .
that wasn' t the way you made it up before .
that' s all i know .
we don' t need no fancy words .
we need to practice , to rehearse .
i' il tell you what we need .
we need some paying gigs .
we don' t need this messing around .
that' s ridiculous .
amen , johnson .
we don' t got no goddamn band !
we don' t need to fucking practice !
we don' t need a shit ass manager neither !
you motherfuckers !
you' re all just a bunch of losers !
i' m the only sane son of a bitch here !
get the fuck out of my house !
it' s not your house .
it' s linda' s .
i' il whip the dog shit out of you .
i will fucking kill you if you talk to me again !
all of you get the fuck out before i get too mad to turn back !
what about our instruments ?
come here , you little prick !
come here , you little fucking prick !
get out !
all y' all !
get the fuck out !
come on , you motherfuckers !
get the fuck out !
randy , you tuning son of a bitch !
go fucking practice !
come on , morris .
you fucking genius .
get the fuck up ... and get the fuck out of here , goddammit !
this ain' t right , doyle .
there' s something wrong with you .
get out !
nobody wants to take this shit .
dots look good on paper .
you don' t sing them anyway .
you' re just showing your true colors .
stay out of my face , you buzzard !
hey !
i said get out of my house !
that goes for cocksuckers and retards !
get up off your asses and go !
this is not your house .
this is my house .
i' il say who stays and goes .
you got a house .
why don' t you go home to it ?
you know better to talk like that when i' m hurting .
don' t make me knock the piss out of you .
don' t you touch her .
that' s funny , vaughan .
linda , go to bed .
and take little snot nose here with you .
you' re not staying here tonight .
get sober before you come back .
i' m tired of my child seeing this .
get your ass straight or i' il lock your ass out of my life for good .
if you even think about leaving me , i told you ...
i' m gonna kill you deader than a doornail .
that might be better than this .
i' m a witness to you threatening her .
you get the fuck out now !
leave !
don' t tell me what to do .
leave !
don' t do that !
i' m calling the police !
goddamn you , little prick !
don' t touch my mama !
don' t touch her !
go home !
get away from here !
jesus !
hey !
goddamn you !
get away from us !
get away from us !
all right .
okay .
i' m gonna leave now .
fuck me .
i' m gonna go home and sober up .
go on , then .
everything' s bothering me .
i' m hurting , linda .
i love you .
well , i hate you !
i hate you , you little prick !
no , i don' t .
i love your mama .
i just
i can' t explain what goes on .
you bunch of freaks .
i hope you have fun .
i' il call you tomorrow .
i' m sorry , honey .
i said i' m sorry , linda .
all right .
you can kiss my ass .
and if you ever hit me again , you little bastard ...
i' il make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your ass out .
you hear me ?
you all right ?
i' m fine .
let' s just try and forget about tonight .
we don' t need to think about bad thoughts , do we ?
no , honey .
we don' t .
i' il make some coffee and start cleaning up .
karl , you want some coffee , hon ?
coffee kindly make me nervous when i drink it .
you scared me .
i didn' t aim to .
you wanna sit down ?
you need something ?
no , ma' am .
there was these two fellers standing on a bridge going to the bathroom .
one feller says that the water is cold .
the other says that the water is deep .
i believe one feller comes from arkansas .
get it ?
i' il be dog .
reckon you can make some biscuits ?
you mean right now ?
whenever you take a notion to .
i don' t mean to put you out none .
it is nearly breakfast time anyway .
i can' t go to sleep .
i have to be at work in three hours .
you know how it is if you only sleep an hour or two .
you feel worse than if you hadn' t slept at all .
yes , ma' am .
i do .
sit down .
i' il make you some biscuits and gravy .
mustard' s good on them to me .
okay .
thank you .
it' s all right .
i was thinking there' s this girl that works with me .
she' s real heavy , but she' s cute in the face .
well , you know , she' s slow .
she' s a little bit she' s not retarded .
it don' t matter .
i thought you might like to meet her .
vaughan wants to have a supper at his house .
we could invite her .
would you like that ?
i reckon i wouldn' t mind having a little supper .
vaughan' s friend will be there too .
he works at the funeral home .
you know , frank really likes you a lot .
he says you make him feel calm .
i like frank .
he' s a good boy .
me and him made friends .
it ain' t right for me to keep from telling you ... how come me to be in a state hospital .
that' s okay .
it' s not really my business .
have wondered , though .
why was it ?
was it like a nervous breakdown ?
i killed my mother and an old boy named jesse dixon .
i thought they' s doing wrong .
i was about your boy' s age .
they told me i' m well from it now .
was that you ?
i remember that .
i was only three or four ... but i always heard about it growing up .
they say you' re well ?
yes , ma' am .
i like your garage .
i never would hurt you or that boy .
i' d lay my hand on the bible and say the same thing .
i know you wouldn' t , hon .
well , i' il make you some biscuits .
how about you , jerry ?
how are you , bill ?
doing pretty good .
got a sick tiller .
what' s got you down this way ?
i thought i' d check up on karl .
see how things are working out .
he' s pretty quiet , except for them rackets and breathing things he does .
he ain' t threatening me with a killing or nothing .
you couldn' t have been more right about him fixing things .
he' s a regular eli whitney on a lawn mower .
and loves french fries .
he can eat four larges and won' t even belch .
i' m proud to have him .
him staying working out ?
he' s gone to staying with ... that wheatley boy and his mama in their garage .
that little boy' s adopted him like a mascot .
he got a key here to come and go as he pleases .
he' s working out real good .
can i see him ?
sure .
scooter , take jerry in to talk to karl .
all right .
sure you' il be okay staying with that woman and her boy ?
yes , sir .
do they know about you ?
my history ?
yeah .
i told them about it .
they know i' m well .
that miss wheatley made me some biscuits .
i' il be .
that boy , he' s my friend .
he likes the way i talk , and i like the way he talks .
i knew you were gonna be all right .
i just wanna check on you .
i' m gonna tell bill good bye and head on back .
all right , then .
karl , see if you can figure out what' s wrong with this thing .
it won' t crank up .
everything seems to be put together right .
bill , i' il see you .
okay .
stop back by .
don' t worry about your boy .
he' s doing good .
it ain' t got no gas in it .
you see there , scooter .
thinks of the simplest things first .
does everybody like the food ?
yeah .
good .
i haven' t decided yet if i' m a good cook .
karl , you know what ?
melinda was voted employee of the month at the dollar store last february .
isn' t that something ?
yes , ma' am .
i reckon .
when you like pricing items as much as i do ... it' s just bound to happen sooner or later , i guess .
maybe you and melinda might like to take a walk tonight .
it' s such a nice evening .
vaughan , don' t get pushy .
i' m sorry .
i kind of like walking from time to time .
i stay on my feet all the time at work .
i just can' t find shoes that' s comfortable .
hospital shoes might be the answer .
nurse' s shoes .
or the kind old ladies wear who work in school cafeterias .
same difference .
i get real mean when my feet hurt .
it' s the only time i don' t like checking out customers .
when my feet hurt .
you and karl aren' t talking much .
you boys must really like that food .
well , i ain' t got nothing to say about shoes .
listen , everybody .
this might sound corny , but
i' ve had some wine and that tends to make me emotional ... but i' m gonna say it anyway .
it came over me in a rush .
i just want you all to know ... that i care about each and every person at this table .
thank you .
that' s really sweet of you .
we care about you too .
don' t we , y' all ?
yeah .
also , please don' t tell anyone at the store ... that albert was here tonight .
why ?
you know how this town is .
people talk ... and they spread cruel rumors .
unfortunately , there' s certain parts of my life i have to keep private .
you mean about you and albert being together in that way ?
yes .
i think everybody already knows .
they' re always talking about it .
maureen ledbetter told the most awful story ... about why you ain' t allowed at the first baptist church no more .
karl , why don' t you and melinda take a walk ?
it' s nice out .
all right , then .
that sure was quick .
you walk fast , don' t you ?
i reckon .
these are the worst shoes i own for walking .
how far' d you say you want to go ?
i don' t reckon i thought about it too much .
i don' t know .
she just ain' t catching fire .
i don' t know .
she just ain' t catching fire .
did you check them points ?
no , i didn' t .
that' s probably it .
yes , ma' am ?
is karl here ?
yes .
just a minute .
karl .
there' s somebody out here to see you .
some gal holding a nice bouquet .
come on out .
she wants to talk to you .
don' t just sit there .
hi .
i' m on my lunch break .
these are on sale ' cause they' re not fresh .
two ninety nine a bunch , plus my ten percent employee discount .
since i didn' t bring nothing for you on our date last night ...
i thought you might like to have them .
thank you .
scooter , let' s go over to the frosty cream and pick up something for lunch .
i can go .
you don' t have to .
you don' t never go .
goddammit , scooter .
let' s go .
pardon my language , ma' am .
well , i just thought i' d bring them .
i liked walking with you .
i got a blister the size of a quarter on one heel .
well , i' il see you sometime , i guess .
blisters sure can hurt .
yeah .
flowers is pretty .
i' ve always thought that .
me too .
hey , karl .
how' d you know i was in the garage ?
i seen that door cracked open a little .
i figured you was in there .
you off of work ?
yes , sir .
where' d you get them flowers ?
that gal that made employee of the month at the dollar store .
she gave them to me for walking with her .
i was going over to the secret place .
i borrowed one of your books .
you ain' t mad , are you ?
no , sir .
you can look at every one of my books you want to .
thank you .
it' s name' s " a christmas carol .
that' s that one on christmas i was telling you about .
you wanna go with me ?
all right , then .
yeah .
come on .
all right .
know why i want you to play ball with me ?
no .
' cause it' s fun .
don' t matter if you ain' t no good .
it takes your mind off of everything else .
and when you' re trying to score a touchdown ... that' s all you' re thinking about .
i ain' t no account , but daddy always said ... he was proud of me when i threw the ball and ran with it .
did you have any brothers and sisters growing up to play with ?
i had one there for a little bit .
but ... it didn' t get old enough for me to play with it .
why not ?
it die ?
yes , sir .
why ?
it got born a little too early .
my mother and father made it come out too early .
so it died when it come out ?
my daddy come out to the shed and got me ... said , " here .
take this and throw it away .
he handed me a towel with something or another in it .
i started for that barrel ... and i opened up the towel ' cause there was a noise ... and something moving around in it .
that towel was all bloody like all around it there .
it was a little old baby , not no bigger than a squirrel .
it was alive ?
yes , sir .
right then it was .
a boy or girl ?
it was a little old boy .
you threw it in the trash barrel ?
that didn' t seem right to me .
so i went into the shed and got a shoe box ... and emptied out the screwdrivers , washers and nuts ... and things out of it .
i taken the little feller and put him in the box ... buried him in the corner of the yard .
that seemed more proper to me , i reckon .
it was still alive when you buried it ?
i heard it crying a little through that box .
that don' t seem right .
it seems like you would have took care of him ... if he was your brother .
i wasn' t but six or eight .
i reckon i didn' t know what to do .
i didn' t know how to care for no baby .
my mother and father didn' t want him .
they learned me to do what they told me to do .
i figure it probably best we give him right back to the good lord ... right off the bat anyhow .
that makes me feel real sad .
couldn' t you have done something ?
i would have .
i wish i' d had him .
he' d still be right here , now .
living .
it makes me sad too .
i wish there was something i could have did about it .
i don' t think nothing bad oughta happen to children .
i think all those bad things oughta be saved up ... for the folks that done growed up , that' s the way i see it .
i shouldn' t have told you about that .
boy your age ought not to hear such things .
it just kind of come out .
i didn' t mean to say nothing bad about you .
you' re good .
you don' t mean no harm .
you ever think about killing yourself on purpose , like daddy did ?
i studied about it some .
bible says you ought not to .
says you do that , you go off to hades .
some folks call it hell .
i call it hades .
bible says the same thing about killing others too .
yes , sir .
i reckon it does .
spend more time over here
well , hell .
there' s the boys .
how you doing ?
glad you all came back .
i was wanting to talk to y' all .
come sit down .
come on .
sit down .
i was just telling linda we were thinking that things ... would be a lot better if i spent more time over here .
and if we could hell , i' il just start over .
i took off work early today , and your mama did the same , so we could talk .
really what i came over here to do was apologize which ain' t easy for me about how i acted the other night .
i admit it .
i was drunk .
i got all worked up and one thing led to another .
i care about you all , though .
i do .
i don' t mean to be so damned well , asshole ish , i guess would be the word .
karl , i don' t believe i hit you , did l ?
so no apology necessary , i guess .
but , frankie , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry i hit your mama .
it' s just that i' m jealous of her .
i don' t like her life or how she lives it .
i don' t like homosexuals .
and she goes out and buddies up with one , so i gotta deal with that .
i don' t like wimpy ass kids or mental retards ... and she got one of each living with her .
i' m just kidding about that .
i mean , we all got to get along ... no matter what our differences are .
see , i work construction .
i build things .
you understand how important that is to the world , frankie ?
i don' t know if you realize the pressure a man like me' s got on him .
the upshot is , i' m gonna be spending a lot more time here .
we' re gonna all get along like a family should .
i might even surprise you and pop the question .
well .
i' m gonna get on back over to the job site ...
iock up some stuff over there .
i just wanted to stop by and give y' all a little piece of happiness today .
bye bye .
you be a good boy now .
hear me ?
well , at least he' s trying ... but who knows for how long .
he' s lying , mama .
he' il never do better .
i know , honey .
just remember what i said .
we' il bide our time .
you just steer clear of him as much as you can .
doyle' s had a hard life .
it' s just about run him crazy .
we had hard lives too , mama .
you' re a hell of a boy , frank .
someday , you' re gonna get all the good things you deserve .
karl' s gonna get some more biscuits tonight .
what do you think about that ?
i could sure use some .
karl , come unload a generator for me .
lift this thing down and carry it to the back .
it' s on the blink .
you want us to help you lift that ?
no .
that karl' s strong enough to lift a bulldozer .
he can fix anything too .
he' s mentally retarded , but he' s a whiz at small engines .
the lord works in mysterious ways .
what i was telling you was , he didn' t just make the team ...
coach says he' s gonna start him at end on defense .
guy' s a chip off the old block , ain' t you , steve ?
i guess so .
how' s the rest of the team look ?
pretty good .
we expect to do well .
got a quarterback this year ?
jeff bailey' s boy .
you know him .
got a good arm .

i watched him in junior high .
he throws the ball pretty well .
he' s taller now .
you gonna start at the defensive end ?
hup !
come on , man !
good job , karl .
we got a touchdown .
that was a good lateral .
that was just like the wishbone .
yes , sir .
i darned near made me a touchdown .
then i seen them boys bearing down on me .
figured i better give it off to you .
i seen you following me .
we liable to win if we keep this up .
for somebody like you , you sure can run fast .
come on .
let' s kick off to them .
all right , then .
i know you could have scored that touchdown by yourself ... instead of throwing it over to me .
them boys was trying to pull me down pretty hard .
you' re strong .
you just threw it to me ... where i could score that touchdown so i' d feel good .
my daddy used to do that kind of thing .
it don' t matter to me about us losing .
does it to you ?
no , sir .
it was fun anyhow .
i wasn' t thinking about nothing else , just like you told me i' d do .
can we play every saturday ?
if i ain' t too stove up .
i ain' t like you .
i' m old and give out .
i' m proud of you .
i' d kick your head in 25 years ago .
you' re dead , i guess .
where' d you go to ?
i know , mother .
that' s kind of sad .
i was drunk when i did it .
i' m your boy .
i ain' t got no boy .
i' m your oldest boy , name of karl .
i ain' t got no boy .
they turned me loose from the nervous hospital .
said i was well .
i got hired on to work for mr. bill cox , fixing lawn mowers and whatnot .
that grass out there in the yard growed up quite a bit .
i figured i might cut it for you .
i told you i ain' t got no boy .
get on out of here and let me be .
you ain' t no kin to me .
i learned to read some .
i read the bible quite a bit .
i can' t understand all of it .
but i reckon i understand a good deal of it .
them stories you and mama told me , they ain' t in there .
you ought not done that to your boy .
i studied on killing you .
i studied about it quite a bit .
but i reckon there' s no need for it if all you' re gonna do ... is sit there in that chair .
you' il be dead soon enough .
and the world' il be shut of you .
you ought not kill my little brother .
he ought of had a chance to growed up .
he would have had fun sometime .
little feller .

we can' t baptize you .
we' il go see brother epersom tomorrow and get you baptized .
it' s sunday .
you go on back to bed now .
what are you doing with that damn hammer ?
i don' t rightly know .
i just woke up holding it .
what' s he' s doing with that hammer ?
i don' t know .
upon his profession of faith in our lord jesus christ ... in obedience under his command ... and by the authority of this church ...
i indeed baptize this brother ... in the name of the father and the son ... and the holy ghost .
amen .
marie , would you sing 137 , please ?
softly and tenderly
jesus is calling
calling for you and for me
how' d the baptizing go ?

it sounds fine to me .
i' d value me a chicken leg or two .

i just wanted to get your mama out of the house so we could talk .
here' s the deal , frank .
if i' m gonna throw my life away to come live with y' all ... we' re gonna get some shit straight .
your mama and i don' t have no problems except for you .
fact is , we never have a bad word between us .
but since you do exist ... and i' m gonna be the head of the household ... you' re gonna learn to live by my rules .
you don' t speak unless you' re spoken to .
you got me ?
now you stay the hell out of my way .
and do what a regular kid does .
you' re a weird little shit , frank .
and i don' t get you .
so wake up and face what they call reality .
we' re gonna be a family .
my family .
i' il be paying all the bills .
so that means , you' re stuck with my ass ... but i ain' t your daddy .
you just act like i am .
the other thing i say is ... your buddy karl is going .
we can' t be no normal family with him living in the garage ... and coming in the bedroom at 4 : 00 in the morning with hammers .
karl could stay if he wants to .
mama said
what i tell you about your mama ?
mister , don' t you never lay another hand on that boy .
you understand me ?
let go of my hand , you retard .

get your shit and get out !
that' s a wake up call , frankie .

i' m going off somewheres .
well , okay .
i got you some .
frank he went off somewheres too .
so when you go in there , he won' t be indoors .
where did he go ?
what' s going on ?
he just wanted to go play , i reckon .
you go in and eat with that doyle ... and don' t worry yourself none .
all right , then .
well , i' il see you later .
if you see frank , tell him to come home .
i don' t get to see him except sundays .
he can go play tomorrow .
ma' am ?

you' re a good mama to that boy .
you care for him .
you work hard to care for him .
you light him up in his eyes .
i' ve seen it .
that boy wouldn' t know what to do without you .
thank you .
that' s real good of you to say .
i wouldn' t know what to do without him either .

i wish me and you and mama would just run away .
she said ... wherever we went , he' d find us .
he' s crazy .
sometimes i think it' d been better off if i wasn' t even born .
i' m glad of it you was borned .
i don' t reckon i' m gonna be out there in the garage no more .
you have to .
you have to look out for me .
you can' t let that son of a bitch run you off .
you just a boy .
you ought not use language like that .
i don' t mean to say nothing bad about you ... but why don' t you stop doyle when he' s being that way ?
you' re older than him .
you' re strong too .
my daddy wouldn' t let him do that to me and mama .
that feller' s a whole site meaner than me .
he' d just whup the tar out of me .
yeah .
i guess so .
i' m real tired , you know that ?
a boy my age shouldn' t be tired of things .
i' m tired too .
just ' cause i ain' t gonna be around no more , maybe ... that don' t mean i don' t care for you .
i care for you a good deal .
i care for you more than anything else there is .
you and me made friends right off the bat .
i care for you too .
but you' il be around .
don' t say that .
it don' t make no difference where i was to be .
we' il always be friends .
can' t nobody stop that .
i aim for you to have these books .
you don' t wanna give away all your books .
i aim for you to have them .
maybe you can make more sense of them than i can .
i made you a bookmarker and put it in that book on christmas .
thanks .
you know when you got a feeling and you don' t know why ?
yes , sir .
i got a feeling today .
reckon , what kind of a feeling ?
like something different .
i don' t know .
you leaving , ain' t you ?
would you do something for me if i was to ask you to ?
you know i would .
whatever you want .
when you leave outta here tonight ...
i don' t want you going over there and staying with that doyle .
he' s got it out for you tonight .
i got me a feeling too .
you ought not be over there when he' s all liquored up and mean .
your mama neither .
when you get up here and leave , i want you to go to that feller' s house your mama' s friend .
i want you to give me your word on it .
okay .
i give you my word on it .
is everything gonna be okay ?
are you all right ?
yeah , everything' s gonna be all right , boy .
i kind of wanna put my arm around you for a minute ... then i' m gonna get up and leave out of here .
i love you , boy .
i love you too .
all right , then .
what are you doing here ?
you wanna come in ?
i ain' t staying .
i need to ask you for a favor .
this evening i want you to go get miss wheatley ... and let her and frank stay over here with you tonight .
what' s wrong ?
ls everything all right ?
that doyle ... he' s in a bad way again with that drinking and being mean to folks .
i want you to give me your word you' il do it .
sure .
okay .
he hasn' t hurt them , has he ?
no , sir .
not yet .
here .
i want you to give that to miss wheatley .
it ain' t much ... but they might be a little something there to help out .
it' s what i made fixing lawn mowers and whatnot for bill cox .
how about you , karl ?
you wanna stay here ?
i don' t reckon that you have to go with women to be a good daddy to a boy .
you been real square dealing with me .
bible says two men ought not lay together .
but i bet you the good lord wouldn' t send nobody like you to hades .
that boy frank he lives inside of his own heart .
that' s an awful big place to live in .
you take care of that boy .
i will .
where' s everybody else ?
you seen them ?
didn' t i tell you to get moved out of here ?
how does a feller go about getting hold of the police ?
use the fucking phone , i guess .
which numbers do you put in ?
can' t you see i' m trying to relax ?
i thought i told you to get out of here and leave me alone .
what the hell you doing with that lawn mower blade ?
i aim to kill you with it .
to call the police you push ... nine , one , one .
just tell them to bring an ambulance .
or a " hearst , " if you' re gonna kill me .
yes , ma' am .
i need the police sent over here to the wheatley house .
i' ve killed doyle hargraves with a lawn mower blade .
yes , ma' am .
i' m right sure of it .
i hit him two good whacks with it .
that second one just plumb near cut his head in two .
it' s a little old white house ... on the corner of vine street and some other street .
there' s a truck out front , says " doyle hargraves construction " on it .
i' il be sitting here waiting on you .
and doyle said besides sending the police ... you might wanna send an ambulance ... or a " hearst .
thank you .
so ... now on the third day ...
i washed her , ' cause she wasn' t too clean , you know .
but i got all the right spots .
she was the first one i ever kept ...
' cause i get bored real easy i got a short attention span , you know .
now i can' t say that she enjoyed her stay ... with that washcloth i put in her mouth and held in place with duct tape .
kept her complaining down to a minimum .
i don' t like people who talk all the time .
i like to do all the talking .
that' s why i think i' m so fond of you ...
' cause you just so easygoing , you know .
although , i do sense a little tension in you from time to time .
so you were out in the world ?
did you have fun ?
did you make any acquaintances ?
there was a boy .
we made friends .
i' il bet you did .
i was never bent that way .
i was bent the other way .
so ?
what was it like out there in the world ?
it was too big .
it' s not too big in here , is it ?
you know something ?
i feel real ... generous today i feel like listening .
i bet you got plenty to tell .
who' d you kill ?
was it the boy ?
don' t you say nothing about that boy .
fact of business , don' t you say another word to me .
i ain' t listening to you no more .
yeah .
