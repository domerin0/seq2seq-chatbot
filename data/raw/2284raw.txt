three billion human lives ended on august 29 , 1997 .
the survivors of the nuclear fire ... called the war " judgment day .
they lived only to face a new nightmare ... the war against the machines .
the computer which controlled the machines , skynet ... sent two terminators back through time .
their mission : to destroy the leader of the human resistance .
john connor , my son .
the first terminator was programmed to strike at me ... in the year 1984 ... before john was born .
it failed .
the second was set to strike at john himself ... when he was still a child .
as before , the resistance was able to send a lone warrior ... a protector for john .
it was just a question of which one of them would reach him first .
i need your clothes , your boots and your motorcycle .
you forgot to say please .
get him off me !
pull it out !
take it .
can' t let you take the man' s wheels , son .
now , get off before i put you down .
that' s it , goddamn it .
r 31 david , sherman code 6 ... at the sixth street bridge and santa fe on electrical disturbance .
ten four , r 31 david .
connor , john
john , get in there and clean up that pigsty of yours .
your foster parents are kind of dicks , huh ?
i swear , i have had it with that goddamn kid .
he won' t even answer me anymore .
honey , move .
would you get off your butt and help me ?
todd !
what ?
he hasn' t cleaned that room of his in a month .
oh , it' s an emergency .
hang on .
i' il get right on it .
come on .
get your ass inside .
do what your mother tells you .
she' s not my mother , todd .
this next patient is interesting .
i' ve been following the case for years .
a 29 year old female ... diagnosed as acute schizo affective disorder .
the usual indicators : depression , anxiety , violent acting out ... delusions of persecution .
the delusional architecture is fairly unique .
she believes that a machine called the terminator ... which looks human , was sent back through time ... to kill her .
that' s original .
and also that the father of her child ... was a soldier sent back to protect her .
he was from the future too .
the year 2029 , if i remember correctly .
and here we are .
morning , sarah .
good morning , dr. silberman .
how' s the knee ?
fine , sarah .
she stabbed me in the kneecap ... with my pen a few weeks ago .
repeated escape attempts .
let' s move on , shall we ?
i don' t like to see the patients disrupting their rooms like this .
see she takes her thorazine .
sure .
i' il take care of it .
are you the legal guardian of john connor ?
that' s right , officer .
what' s he done now ?
could i speak with him , please ?
you could if he were here .
he took off on his bike this morning .
he could be anywhere .
do you have a photograph of john ?
yeah .
hold on .
gonna tell me what this is about ?
i just need to ask him a few questions .
he' s a good looking boy .
do you mind if i keep this picture ?
no , go on .
there was a guy here this morning looking for him too .
yeah , a big guy on a bike .
has that got something to do with this ?
i wouldn' t worry about him .
thanks for your cooperation .
please insert your stolen card now .
pln number .
hurry up .
this is taking too long .
go , baby .
all right .
pln number 9003 .
where' d you learn this stuff from ?
from my mom .
my real mom , i mean .
withdraw 300 bucks .
come on , baby .
come on !
yes !
hey , it worked .
all right .
easy money .
come on !
yes !
piece of cake .
ls that her ?
yes .
she' s pretty cool , huh ?
no , she' s a complete psycho .
that' s why she' s at pescadero .
it' s a mental institute .
she tried to blow up a computer factory but got shot and arrested .
no shit .
she' s a total loser .
come on .
let' s go spend some money .
it' s like a giant strobe light ... burning right through my eyes .
somehow i can still see .
oh , god .
we know the dream' s the same every night .
why do i have to ...
please continue .
children look like burnt paper .
black .
not moving .
and then the blast wave hits them .
and they fly apart like leaves .
dreams ... of cataclysm , the end of the world ... are very common .
it' s not a dream , you moron .
it' s real .
i know the date it happens .
i' m sure it feels real to you .
on august 29 , 1997 ... it' s gonna feel pretty fuckin ' real to you too !
anybody not wearing two million sunblock is gonna have a real bad day .
get it ?
god , you think you' re safe and alive .
you' re already dead .
everybody !
him .
you .
you' re dead already .
this whole place , everything you see is gone !
you' re the one living in the dream , ' cause i know it happened !
it happened !
i feel much better now .
clearer .
yes , your attitude has been ... much improved lately .
it' s helped me to have a goal ... something to look forward to .
what is that ?
well , you said ... that if i showed improvement after six months ... you would transfer me to the minimum security wing ... and i could have visitors .
well , it' s been six months ... and ...
i was looking forward to seeing my son .
i see .
let' s go back to what you were saying about those terminator machines .
now you think they don' t exist ?
they don' t exist .
i know that now .
but you' ve told me on many occasions about how you crushed one ... in a hydraulic press .
if i had , there would have been some evidence .
they would have found something at the factory .
i see .
so you don' t believe anymore that the company covered it up ?
no .
why would they ?
let' s try a new position right there .
mr. dyson ?
the materials team is running another ...
mr. dyson .
yes ?
the materials team is running another series this afternoon .
you have to sign for the ... it .
you have to sign it out .
okay .
i' il get it .
i know i haven' t been here long , but i was wondering if you know ...
know what ?
if you know where ' it ' came from .
i asked them the same question once .
you know what they told me ?
don' t ask .
good morning , mr. dyson .
how' s it going ?
insert key .
left on three .
two , one , turn .
how are the wife and kids ?
great .
thanks .
so what do you think , doctor ?
haven' t i shown improvement ?
well , sarah , here' s the problem .
i know how smart you are .
you' re just telling me what i want to hear .
i don' t think you really believe what you' re telling me today .
if i put you in minimum security , you' il just try to escape again .
you have to let me see my son .
please .
he' s in great danger .
he' s naked without me .
if i could make a phone call ...
i' m afraid not .
not for a while .
i don' t see any choice but to recommend to the review board ... that you stay here for another six months .
i' il kill you , you son of a bitch !
you son of a bitch !
ten ccs of sodium amobarbital , stat !
you don' t know what you' re doing !
get some restraints in here now !
you don' t know what you' re doing !
model citizen .
you just missed him .
he was here 15 minutes ago .
he was going to the galleria .
yeah .
the galleria ?
i' m gonna get some quarters .
i' il be back , all right ?
oh , no !
girls , do you know john connor ?
hey , do you know this guy ?
nah , i don' t know him .
john .
not now .
there' s this cop scoping for you .
check it out .
he' s right over there .
split , man .
just go .
yeah .
i saw that kid ...
you' re not supposed to be in here !
get down .
mister , are you all right ?
you all right ?
come on !
goddamn !
okay , time out .
stop the bike .
time out .
come on , stop the bike .
holy shit .
now , don' t take this the wrong way .
you are a terminator , right ?
yes .
cyberdyne systems , model 101 .
holy shit .
you' re really real .
i mean ...
you' re like a machine underneath , right ?
but alive outside ?
i' m a cybernetic organism .
living tissue over metal endoskeleton .
this is intense .
get a grip , john .
okay .
you' re not here to kill me .
i figured that part out for myself .
so what' s the deal ?
my mission is to protect you .
yeah ?
who sent you ?
you did .
thirty five years from now , you reprogrammed me ... to be your protector here , in this time .
oh , this is deep .
so this other guy , he' s a terminator like you , right ?
not like me .
a t 1000 , advanced prototype .
more advanced than you are ?
yes .
a mimetic poly alloy .
what the hell does that mean ?
liquid metal .
where are we going ?
we have to get out of the city immediately and avoid the authorities .
i gotta stop by my house .
i wanna pick up some stuff .
negative .
the t 1000 would definitely try to reacquire you there .
you sure ?
i would .
look , todd and janelle are dicks ... but i gotta warn' em .
shit .
you got a quarter ?
hello .
janelle , it' s me .
john ?
ls everything all right ?
are you guys okay ?
sure , honey , everything' s okay .
are you all right ?
yeah , i' m fine .
john , it' s late .
i was beginning to worry about you .
if you hurry home , we can sit down and have dinner together .
i' m making beef stew .
something' s wrong .
she' s never this nice .
where are you ?
what the hell is the goddamn dog barking at ?
hey , shut up , you worthless piece of shit !
the dog' s really barking .
you were gonna tell the kid to get rid of that mutt .
john , it' s late .
please don' t make me worry .
could he already be there ?
are you okay ?
i' m right here .
i' m fine .
are you sure you' re all right ?
what' s the dog' s name ?
max .
hey , janelle .
what' s wrong with wolfie ?
i can hear him barking .
ls he okay ?
wolfie' s fine , honey .
wolfie' s just fine .
where are you ?
your foster parents are dead .
i need a minute here .
you' re telling me that this thing can imitate anything it touches ?
anything it samples by physical contact .
get real .
it could disguise itself as a pack of cigarettes ?
no , only an object of equal size .
why not just become a bomb or something to get me ?
it can' t form complex machines .
guns and explosives have chemicals , moving parts .
it doesn' t work that way .
but it can form solid metal shapes .
like what ?
knives and stabbing weapons .
these were taken by a video surveillance camera ... at the west highland police station in 1984 .
he killed 17 police officers that night .
men with families ... children .
these were taken at a mall in reseda ... today .
miss connor , we know you know who this guy is .
i just sat here and told you that your son is missing ... that the foster parents have been murdered .
we know this guy' s involved .
doesn' t that mean anything to you ?
don' t you care ?
we' re wasting our time .
let' s go .
sorry , guys .
she' s grown more disconnected from reality as time goes on .
i' m afraid she can' t help us now .
if she clears at all and can give us anything , i' il call you .
sure .
douglas , take her back to her room .
yes , sir .
come on , sweetheart .
let' s go .
you see ... we spent a lot of time in nicaragua and places like that .
for a while there , she was with this crazy ex green beret guy ... running guns .
then there were some other guys .
she' d shack up with anybody she could learn from ... so she could teach me how to be this great military leader .
then she gets busted .
it' s like , ' sorry , kid , your mom' s a psycho .
didn' t you know ? '
like everything i' ve been brought up to believe is all made up bullshit .
i hated her for that .
but everything she said was true .
she knew ... and nobody believed her ... not even me .
listen .
we gotta get her out of there .
negative .
the t 1000' s highest probability for success now ... will be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her .
great .
what happens to her ?
typically , the subject being copied is terminated .
shit !
why didn' t you tell me ?
we gotta go right now !
negative .
it' s not a mission priority .
fuck you !
she' s a priority to me !
goddamn it !
what' s your problem ?
help !
this does not help our mission .
get this psycho off of me !
help !
i' m being kidnapped !
get this psycho off of me !
let me go !
why did you do that ?
because you told me to .
what ?
you have to do what i say ?
that' s one of my mission parameters .
prove it .
stand on one foot .
yes !
cool .
my own terminator .
wow .
you okay , kid ?
take a hike , bozo .
let' s get outta here , man .
fuck you , you little dipshit !
dipshit ?
put your leg down .
did you call moi a dipshit ?
just trying to help this punk .
grab this guy .
get him off of me !
now who' s the dipshit ... you jock douche bag ?
put the gun down now !
get outta here !
come on .
let' s split !
you were gonna kill that guy !
of course .
i' m a terminator .
listen to me very carefully , okay ?
you' re not a terminator anymore , all right ?
you got that ?
you just can' t go around killing people .
why ?
what do you mean , why ?
' cause you can' t .
because you just can' t .
trust me on this .
look .
i' m gonna go get my mom .
i order you to help me .
you have a sarah connor here ?
you' re runnin ' kind of late .
they' ve been in there for an hour .
hold on a second .
i' il buzz you in .
oh , here come your friends now .
gwen , you want some coffee ?
no , thanks .
how ' bout a beer ?
yeah , right .
hey , i got a full house .

must be my lucky day .
you' re right about number 24 .
increase the medication to 250 milligrams .
same kind ?
mm hmm .

you broke my arm .
there are 215 bones in the human body .
that' s one .
now , don' t move .
what are you going to do ?
why do we stop now ?
you gotta promise me you' re not gonna kill anyone , right ?
right .
swear ?
what ?
just put up your hand and say , " i swear i won' t kill anyone " .
i swear i will not kill anyone .
all right .
let' s go .
visiting hours is 10 : 00 to 4 : 00 ...
monday through friday .

you son of a bitch !
you shot me !
crazy bastard !
don' t shoot me again .
don' t kill me .
he' il live .
son of a bitch !
let' s try to remain calm .
open it , or he' il be dead before he hits the floor .
there' s no way , connor .
let him go .
open the door .
it ain' t gonna happen .
take it easy , sarah .
it won' t work .
you' re no killer .
i don' t believe you can do it .
you' re already dead .
everybody dies .
you know i believe it .
so don' t fuck with me !
open the door !
back off !
get back !
i' il pump him full of this shit .
i swear !
don' t move !
drop the shit !
do it !
get in the office .
on the floor , face down .
not you !
open the door .
on the floor .
hold it open .
face the wall !
get her !
hurry up !

here , drive .
there' s nobody behind us .
are you all right ?
yeah .
can he see anything ?
i see everything .
cool .
come here .
i said i was okay .
john , it was stupid of you to go there .
you have to be smarter than that .
you were almost killed .
what were you thinking ?
you cannot risk yourself , even for me .
do you understand ?
you' re too important .
do you understand ?
but ...
i had to get you out of that place .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t need your help .
what' s wrong with your eyes ?
nothing .
so , what' s your story ?
you okay ?
fine .
say , that' s a nice bike .
watch it , lug nuts .
listen , do you know what you' re doing ?
i have detailed files on human anatomy .
i bet .
makes you a more efficient killer , right ?
correct .
does it hurt when you get shot ?
i sense injuries .
the data could be called " pain " .
john , help me with the light .
will these heal up ?
yes .
good .
if you can' t pass for human , you' re not much good to us .
how long do you live ?
i mean , last .
whatever .
a hundred and twenty years with my existing power cell .
can you learn stuff that you haven' t been programmed with ... so you can be ... you know , more human ... and not such a dork all the time ?
my cpu is a neural net processor , a learning computer .
the more contact i have with humans , the more i learn .
cool .
are we learning yet ?
we have to get as far away from the city as possible .
just head south .
keep it under 65 .
we don' t want to be pulled over .
affirmative .
you gotta listen to the way people talk .
you don' t say ' affirmative ' or some shit like that .
you say , " no problemo " .
if someone comes off to you with an attitude , you say , " eat me " .
and if you want to shine them on , it' s " hasta la vista , baby " .
yeah , or " later , dick wad " .
if someone gets upset , you say , " chill out " .
or you can do combinations .
chill out , dick wad .
that' s great .
see ?
you' re getting it .
want some of my fries ?
need any help ?
no .
i got you !
no , you didn' t !
we' re not gonna make it , are we ?
people , i mean .
it' s in your nature to destroy yourselves .
yeah .
major drag , huh ?
break it up before i wring both of your necks .
i need to know how skynet gets built .
who' s responsible ?
the man most directly responsible is miles bennett dyson .
who is that ?
he' s the director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation .
why him ?
in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of microprocessor .
go on .
then what ?
in three years cyberdyne will become the largest supplier ... of military computer systems .
all stealth bombers are upgraded with cyberdyne computers ... becoming fully unmanned .
afterwards they fly with a perfect operational record .
the skynet funding bill is passed .
the system goes on line on august 4 , 1997 .
human decisions are removed from strategic defense .
skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate .
it becomes self aware at 2 : 14 a . m .
eastern time , august 29 .
in a panic , they try to pull the plug .
skynet fights back .
yes .
it launches its missiles against the targets in russia .
why attack russia ?
aren' t they our friends now ?
because skynet knows that the russian counterattack ... will eliminate its enemies over here .
jesus .
how much do you know about dyson ?
i have detailed files .
i want to know everything .
what he looks like , where he lives , everything .
wait in the car .
you' re pretty jumpy , connor .
hey , big john .
what' s up ?
he' s cool , enrique .
he' s with me .
he' s ...
uncle bob .
uncle bob , this is enrique .
uncle bob , huh ?
okay .
drink ?
uncle bob " ?
you' re pretty famous , all over the goddamn tv .
pictures of you , john , your big friend here .
cops are going nuts looking for you .
i just came for my stuff .
i need clothes , food and a truck .
how about the fillings in my teeth ?
now , enrique .
you two , you' re on weapons detail .
let' s go .
one thing about my mom ... she always plans ahead .
excellent .
this is my best truck , but the starter motor' s gone .
you got time to change it out ?
yeah .
i' m gonna wait ' til dark to cross the border .
i grew up in places like this ... so i thought that' s how people lived ... riding around in helicopters , learning how to blow shit up .
that' s definitely you .
most of the guys my mom hung around with were geeks ... but there was this one guy , he was kinda cool .
he taught me engines .
hold here .
mom screwed it up , of course .
she' d always tell ' em about judgment day ... and me being this world leader .
that' d be all she wrote .
torque wrench , please .
here .
i wish i could' ve met my real dad .
you will .
yeah , i guess .
when i' m , like 45 , i think .
they sent him back through time to 1984 .
man .
he hasn' t even been born yet .
it messes with your head .
the other bolt .
oh .
here .
mom and him were only together for one night .
she still loves him , i guess .
i see her crying sometimes .
she denies it totally , of course , like she got something stuck in her eye .
why do you cry ?
you mean people ?
yeah .
i don' t know .
we just cry ... you know , when it hurts .
pain causes it ?
no .
it' s different .
it' s when there' s nothing wrong with you , but you hurt anyway .
you get it ?
no .
all right , my man !
give me five .
just put out your hand like this .
all right !
now hit me .
give me five .
do the same thing .
okay , that' s good .
up high .
five low .
too slow .
i' m just kidding .
one more time .
good .
now try it .
now do me .
give me five .
watching john with the machine , it was suddenly so clear .
the terminator would never stop .
it would never leave him , never hurt him ... never shout at him or get drunk and hit him ... or be too busy to spend time with him .
it would always be there ... and it would die to protect him .
of all the would be fathers who came and went over the years ... this thing , this machine ... was the only one who measured up .
in an insane world ... it was the sanest choice .
hey , let' s try this one .
there we go .
she said go south with him like you planned .
she' il meet you tomorrow .
mom !
mom , wait !
no fate " .
no fate but what we make .
my father told her this .
i made him memorize it in the future as a message to her .
never mind .
okay , the whole thing goes ...
the future' s not set .
there' s no fate but what we make for ourselves .
she intends to change the future .
yeah , i guess .
oh , shit !
dyson .
yeah .
gotta be .
miles dyson .
she' s gonna blow him away .
come on !
let' s go !
this is tactically dangerous .
drive faster .
the t 1000 has the same files that i do .
it knows what i know .
it might anticipate this move .
i don' t care .
we gotta stop her .
killing dyson might prevent the war .
i don' t care !
haven' t you learned anything yet ?
haven' t you figured out why you can' t kill people ?
danny , i told you to go to bed .
i' m not kidding .
just a couple of minutes , mom !
danny , your time is up !
come brush your teeth and get to bed .
danny !
daddy !
danny , go !
go !
miles ?
tortsia , run !
oh , my god !
just take danny and run !
run !
oh , jesus !
miles !
daddy !
nobody fucking move !
don' t hurt my daddy !
on the floor , bitch .
get down now !

don' t hurt him !
get on the floor now !
just let the boy go .
shut up .
shut up .
shut up !
it' s all your fault , motherfucker .
it' s all your fault !
what ?
i' m not gonna let you do it .
shit !
we' re too late !
check them .
look at me , mom .
are you hurt ?
i almost ...
it' il be okay .
we' il figure something out .
okay ?
i promise .
you came here to stop me .
yeah , i did .
i love you , john .
i always have .
i know .
