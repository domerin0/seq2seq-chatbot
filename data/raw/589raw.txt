kip ?
kip ?
kip !
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
hey , we' re goin ' home !
when we' re out together dancing cheek to cheek
it' s raining .
and the cares that hung around me through the week
seem to vanish like a gambler' s lucky streak
when we' re out together dancing cheek to cheek
oh , i love to climb a mountain
and to reach the highest peak
but it doesn' t thrill me half as much
as dancing cheek to cheek
kip , come and dance with us .
later .
oh , come on .
clap now .
yeah .
here comes the bomb squad !
hey , let me handle it !
go on , sergeant hardy !
bring ' em home !
hardy !

i' m never going to forgive myself .
i' m never going to bloody forgive myself .
sergeant hardy , sir .
it was booby trapped .
they was runnin ' up the union jack , sir , up on that statue .
it just went off , sir .
sergeant hardy climbed up , sir , just for a lark , sir .
it should' ve been me .
it was my idea .
sir , you don' t wanna look .
ooh .
who' s that girl ?
his fiancee , sir .
hardy' s ?
he kept it a bit dark .
kip ?
kip , it' s me .
i' m so sorry about what happened .
can i talk to you ?
kip ?
kip , why won' t you talk to me ?
oh , kip .
oh , let me come in !
hana tells me you' re leaving .
there' s going to be trials .
they want me to interpret .
don' t they know i' m allergic to courtrooms ?
so ...
i come across the hospital convoy .
they' re looking for this stuff .
this nurse , mary , tells me about you and hana ... hiding in some monastery in
what do you call it ?
retreat ?
how you came out of the desert ... and you were burned and you didn' t remember your name , but you knew the words to every song that ever was ... and you had one possession : a copy of herodotus .
and it was filled ... with letters and cuttings .
then i knew it was you .
me ?
i saw you ... writing in that book at the embassy in cairo ... when i had thumbs and you had a face ... and a name .
i see .
before you went over to the germans , before you found a way to get rommel' s spy across the desert and inside british headquarters .
he took some pretty good photographs .
i saw mine in that torture room in tobruk .
so , it made an impression .
i had to get back to the desert .
i' d made a promise .
the rest meant nothing to me .
what did you say ?
that the rest ... meant nothing to me .
there was a result to what you did .
it wasn' t just another expedition .
it did this .
if the british hadn' t unearthed that photographer , thousands of people could have died .
thousands of people did die .
just different people .
yes , like madox .
what ?
you know he shot himself , your partner ,
when he found out you were a spy .
what ?
madox thought i was a spy ?
no .
no , i was never a spy .
it' s ghastly .
it' s like a witch hunt .
anybody remotely foreign is suddenly a spy .
so watch out .
right .
we didn' t care about countries , did we ?
brits , arabs , hungarians , germans
none of that mattered , did it ?
it was something finer than that .
yes , it was .
i' il leave the plane in kufra oasis .
so , if you need it  right .
hard to know how long one' s talking about .
we might all be back in a month or two .
hmm .
i have to teach myself not to read too much into everything .
it comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all .
goodbye , my friend .
there is no god .
but i hope someone looks after you .
in case you' re still wondering , this is called a suprasternal notch .
come and visit us in dorset when all this nonsense is over .
you' il never come to dorset .
so , you didn' t know madox shot himself .
no .
and you didn' t kill the cliftons ?
sh
she
she die
she i can' t .
well , maybe i did .
maybe i did .
i was packing up our base camp ... at the cave of swimmers .
clifton had offered to fly down from cairo to collect me .
he flew like a madman always , so i i took no notice .
aaah !
katharine ?
dear god , katharine , what are you doing here ?
i can' t get out .
i can' t move .
surprise , " he said .
poor geoffrey .
he knew .
he must' ve known all the time .
he was shouting , " i love you , katharine .
i love you so much .
is he badly hurt ?
i have to get you out .
please don' t move me .
i have to get you out .
it hurts too much .
i know , darling , i know .
i' m sorry .
come on .
now !
why did you hate me ?
what ?
don' t you know you drove everybody mad ?
shh .
don' t talk .
you speak so many bloody languages ... and you never want to talk .
you' re wearing the thimble .
of course .
you idiot .
i always wear it .
i' ve always worn it .
i' ve always loved you .
it' s so cold .
i know .
i' m sorry .
i' il make a fire .
did you get geoffrey out of the plane ?
yes , i did .
good .
that' s good .
thank you .
listen to me , katharine .
you' ve broken your ankle ... and i' m going to have to try and bind it .
i think you' ve also broken your wrist ... and maybe some ribs , which is why it' s hurting you to breathe .
i' m going to have to walk to el taj .
although , given all the traffic in the desert these days ,
i' m bound to bump into one army or another .
and then i' il come back and you' il be fine .
you promise ?
i wouldn' t want to die here .
i don' t want to die in the desert .
i' ve always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind .
particular hymns .
and i know exactly where i want to be buried .
in our garden , where i grew up ... with a view of the sea .
so promise me you' il come back for me .
i promise ...
i' il come back for you .
i promise ...
i' il never leave you .
you have plenty of water ... and , um , food .
i' il open them for you .
a good read .
don' t waste this .
will you bury geoffrey ?
i know he' s dead .
i' m sorry , katharine .
i know .
every night ...
i cut out my heart .
but in the morning it was full again .
darling .
my darling .
you' d better be ready about half past 8 : 00
now , honey don' t you be late
i' m going to be there when the band starts playing
remember when we get there , honey
an invitation to the strutter' s ball
a very swell affair
all the highbrows will be there
i' il be down to get you in a taxi , honey
i stopped at noon and at twilight .
three days there on foot , i told her , and three hours back by car .
don' t go anywhere .
i' il be back .
i' il be back .
just walked in from the desert , sir .
morning .
dear golly , where have you come from then ?
there' s been an accident .
i need a doctor ... to come with me , and i need to borrow this car .
i' il pay , of course .
and i need i need morphine .
may i see your papers , sir ?
what ?
if i could just see some form of identification .
i' m sorry , i' m not making sense .
forgive me , i i' m not
i' ve been walking and
a woman is badly injured at the gilf kabir , the cave of swimmers .
i' m a member of the royal geographical society .
right .
now , if i could ... just take your name .
count laszlo de almasy .
almasy . " would you mind spelling that for me ?
look , listen to me , will you ?
what nationality would that be ?
a woman is dying .
my wife is dying .
i have been ... walking
i have been walking for three days .
i do not want to spell my name .
i want you to give me this car .
i understand you' re agitated .
perhaps if you' d like to sit down , i can radio back to hq .
no .
no , don' t don' t radio anybody !
just give me the fucking car !
stop the car , please .
a woman is dying !
listen , fritz , if i have to listen to another word from you ,
i' m going to give you a fucking good hiding !
fritz ?
what are you talking about , fritz ?
well , that' s your name , isn' t it ?
count fuckin ' asshole von bismarck !
what' s that supposed to be , irish ?
please !
you have to listen !
katharine !
katharine !
excuse me .
i also need to use the lavatory .
you' il have to wait .
it' s urgent .
sarge !
sarge , jerry wants to use the lav .
says it' s urgent .
where are we going , please ?
oh , up north to the coast .
benghazi .
soon be there .
you can get your boat back home then .
all right , go on then .
here , you take him .
i' ve been up and down this bloody train all day .
it doesn' t open .
aaah !
so yes , she died because of me .
because i loved her .
because i
because i had the wrong name .
and you never got back to the cave ?
i did get back .
i kept my promise .
i was assisted by the germans .
there was a a trade .
i had our expedition maps .
and after the british made me their enemy ,
i gave their enemy our maps .
so i got back to the desert ... and to katharine ... in madox' s english plane ... with german gasoline .
when i arrived in italy , on my medical chart they wrote ,
english patient .
isn' t that funny ?
after all that , i became english .
you get to the morning and the poison leaks away , doesn' t it ?
black nights .
i thought i would kill you .
you can' t kill me .
i died years ago .
no , i can' t kill you now .
we' ve been posted .
north of florence .
i was thinking yesterday yesterday
the patient and hardy .
they' re everything that' s good about england .
i couldn' t even say what that was .
we didn' t exchange two personal words , and we' ve been together through some terrible things .
some terrible things .
he was engaged to a girl in the village .
i mean
and us , he never once
he didn' t ask me if i could spin the ball at cricket or kama sutra or
i don' t even know what i' m talking about .
you loved him .
katharine .
i' m still here .
you' d better be .
don' t depend on it , will you ?
that little bit of air in my lungs , each day it gets less and less .
which is all right .
it' s quite all right .
i' ve been speaking to caravaggio , my research assistant .
he tells me there' s a ghost in the cloisters .
i can join him .
hana !
it' s the boy .
i' il always go back to that church .
look at my paintings .
i' il always go back to that church .
so one day we' il meet .
thank you .
read to me , will you ?
read me to sleep .
my darling ,
i' m waiting for you .
how long is a day in the dark ?
or a week ?
the fire is gone now ... and i' m horr horribly cold .
i really ought to drag myself outside , but then there' d be the sun .
i' m afraid i waste the light ... on the paintings and on writing these words .
we die .
we die .
we die rich with lovers and tribes ,
tastes we have swallowed ,
bodies we have entered ... and swum up like rivers .
fears we' ve hidden in ,
like this wretched cave .
i want all this marked on my body .
we' re the real countries .
not the boundaries drawn on maps , the names of powerful men .
i know you' il come and carry me out into the palace of winds .
that' s all i' ve wanted , to walk in such a place with you , with friends .
an earth without maps .
the lamp' s gone out ,
and i' m writing ... in the darkness .
hana ?
hana , come on !
hana , this is gioia .
buon giorno .
buon giorno .
she' il take you as far as florence .
i can get in back .
