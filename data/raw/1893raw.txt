the afternoon of a torturer
there' s nothing in the universe without a reason .
if something occurs , either visible or invisible ,
it' s because another thing , visible or invisible , provoked it .
a leaf which gets loose and falls ,
the ice that melts ,
the sudden awakening of somebody ,
the appearance of a little spot on the smooths surface of the skin ,
an earthquake , a flood ,
a plentiful harvest of wheat , an insect invasion .
all the phenomenae of the visible and invisible universe are bound to one and the same principle : the causality .
a beating of wings of a butterfly over the mediterranean sea
can start one cyclone in the pacific .
the world is full of miracles
that our spirit is not taking into account anymore .
why does the light cross this window pane
and not this part , there , in our train compartment
who' s made of wood and steel ?
or why doesn' t it cross your body ,
as the x rays
who allow the doctor to see what we had for breakfast
or the customs officer to see what we have in our luggage
when we present them ?
me , madam , i' ve always been concerned
by the rational demonstration of god' s existence .
let' s continue .
when we achieved to crack the atom ,
not so long ago ,
dear madam ,
we isolated an ultimate element ,
an ultimate , unsplittable element : the quark .
there , on top .
the fundamental stone of the universe .
what you see , in the shape of this triangle there ,
it' s the material world as a whole .
but , by extrapolating ,
i prolong these two axes ...
and i obtain what ?
this symmetric triangle to the first one , on top of it .
the immaterial world , the energy ,
usually called antimatter .
the material world is in a ceaseless movement ,
now , the movement ,
even if we consider it only within this mere train corridor ,
occurs in the time .
movement and time .
the movement and the time are inseparable .
their empire , it' s there , this triangle below .
the upper triangle ...
do you know what they are , the hell and the paradise ?
i believe that if we do bad things , we are in hell already .
for me the hell and the paradise exist with a psychological meaning only ,
they are within ourselves ...
but on the metaphysical plan , dear madam ,
they are outside ourselves .
the triangle of at the top represents the energy , in it' s pure form .
or more simply the paradise .
and here , in the centre ...
god .
quod erat demonstrandum .
tandara !
you recognize me , tandara ?
shall we go ?
tell me , would you guess the occupation of our friend , franz tandara ,
during the last 35 years ?
he practises a profession so subtle , i shall say even noble .
millennium .
ancestral .
a biblical profession .
the beekeeping .
where do we go ?
madam asks where we go .
we go to the farm .
what farm ?
it' s not really a farm .
it' s a little house ...
it' s a hut ...
it belonged to my father .
he kept his sheeps in there ...
and now , i keep my bees .
there' s a tree ...
it' s beautiful .
we is going to eat there .
i brought some grills .
it' s there where you buy the cheese ?
what cheese ?
you don' t buy cheese from bulgaria ?
i' ve never been in bulgaria .
never abroad .
but bulgaria , it' s close .
no , i' m telling you .
i' ve never been there and i shall never go !
i' ve never asked of passport .
bees , they take me all my time .
and the hibernation of the bees in the forest , that takes place well ?
i know not i believe so .
it' s the first time , it' s experimental .
towards the end of his life , he doesn' t give up .
he searches , he ' s experimenting .
van gogh !
please , look at this extraordinary yellow , the colour of eternity ...
the honey of sunflower , the sweetest , the most gold coloured .
and this damned car shit ...
i' ve got a new one , too , but my son dosn' t allow me to use it ,
even if it' s me who bought it , see ? ...
who gave it to you ?
say , eh .
i gave everything to him , i shall give him everything ,
if god will leave him alive ...
ticuta !
ticuta ...
don' t leave me , ticuta !
seriously , one could swear this is a van gogh .
what shall i do without you , ticuta !
and the political parties , how is it going here , in giurgiu ?
i' ve given him and i shall give him everything ,
if good god will not take him away from me .
because he is my punishment that comes to me from god .
it' s your son ?  yes .
but your son can not work himself ?
no .
why ?
because my son is only 37 years old ,
but he' s got cirrhosis since he was 19 .
it' s my sins for which i pay .
please , excuse these ...
the honey has a strong erotic connotation .
the honey of the eternal love in the song of songs .
the honey is symbol of eternity .
archaeologists have found honey
since thousands of years ago in clay vases .
isn' t it , franz , that honey never deteriorates ?
what did you say , mr luci ?
you take it out finally ?
if we leave it outside at night , they are going to steal it .
take the grills !
you have some packages in the car there .
some fruit juice ?
no , no ...
bring some fruit juice .
please , enter , mr. professor !
please , make yourselves comfortable .
what is this ?
it' s you as a child ?
yes ...
it' s taken during the holy innocents day .
look , this one died .
this one also ...
this one' s in australia .
that one , i don' t know anymore who he is ...
please , have a seat , please .
thank you .
some coffee ?
no , no ..
let' s get started , we have a lot of work to do .
maybe we should stay outside .
it' s nice outside , nice indeed , especially if the wind is not blowing from avicola .
no .
let' s ...
that' il be fast .
the toilet , it' s behind that tree .
no , no , thank you ...
do you also harvest the poison of the bees ?
i stopped .
it' s difficult .
and what method did you use ?
narcotics
or the electric shock treatment ?
the electric shock treatment .
for the electric shock treatment in bees , you need : a pulse generator ,
the electric source
and the electric surface
where bees gather .
check in the car , there' s something for the ducks , too .
the pulse generator is an electronic device
fed by a 9 12v power source
which creates optimal electromagnetical charges .
optimal , for which purpose ?
optimal to obtain the bee poison .
the wind comes from avicola .
please , tell her not to pass by anymore .
did you hear that ?
stay away !
may i have something to put the flower in ?
come here !
put this flower in the jar .
would it be possible ?
i don' t recall if i already introduced her , she' s my wife .

at the beginning , this was his sheepfold .
he had 20 , 30 sheeps .
it was its sheepfold , all right .
but the law prevents you from inheriting ,
you killed your father , after all ...
it was a parricide
yes , you' re right ...
parricide , it' s the word of the lawyer .
this is the law , madam .
there' s no law , everything can be bought .
what is this , " parricide " ?
madam , on march 4th , 81 , when the doctors opened my son ,
they didn' t even sew him back well . " take him " , they said to me . " that he dies in his bed .
they' ve had already burry him ,
but i , i persisted .
i was in the church and i prayed . " god , please don' t take him away from me .
i' il stop searching for a treasure here , on earth but i' il search it in heaven .
i' ve flooded with my tears the paving stones of the church ,
but i held word ...
what if i didn' t have that money , what would i' ve done ?
nothing .
let' s return to your father , how did you kill him ?
yes .

people said to her : " take care , he is going to kill you .
my mother told her , too ...
sit .
my mother was the first who told her : " you won' t stay together long time . " " he has all bad parts of his father .
she was not afraid .
or maybe she was , but didn' t show ...
but i was imperative .
when i said to her : " do that " , she had to do it .
and if she could bear my wickedness .
because i' m nasty , you know .
it' s my partner for life .
please , go , bring some juice , this one is warm .
please , go !
you want me to tell you about my father ?
look ... he sleeps , the poor man .
i heard rumors that he' s getting into politics .
it' s true ?
please , ask him .
is that thing running ?
yes , it runs , didn' t i tell you ?
from the train station ,
i went straight to the communists .
then i returned at my father' s .
i was 15 . " i don' t have anyone else but you " , he told me , my father ,
that moved me and i stayed with him and his sheeps . " you were wrong to leave us .
what are you now ? " somebody told me
a wanderer , a shepheard .
another one , a big boss from the communist party , he told me : " if he had been my father , i would have knocked him out already .
shortly , i' il continue with the greatest misfortune in my whole life .
that took place during the autumn , on september 7th , it was tuesday .
at 7 am , a dispute burst between me and my father ,
because of his concubine .
he threatened me , he treated me as bolshevik : " go to hell , you damn bolshevik go to your damn party . " it' s them , your friends !
i' ve asked him for a hat .
it was the autumn , september 7th .
he didn' t want to give me anything .
then i decided to kill him .
i took an axe ...
why won' t you give me the hat ?
if there' s a thing i regret , that' s the little girl .
what girl ?
ah yes , i forgot to tell you .
he had a little daughter from a woman who dumped him .
i washed her ) , i brushed her hair ...
i started to like her .
what happened to her ?
she died ...
the evening of the fight .
it' s there , near the tree ...
it' s there that i knocked him out .
why do you keep calling ?
i told you not to call anymore , didn' t i ?
my father had a sister .
i shall tell you , but we' il deviate from the subject .
no problem .
he had a sister , a disabled person , thin , a dwarfish .
she balanced while walking , like a duck .
he was a giant , and she , a duck .
slept well , professor ?
no , i didn' t sleep . it was just resting my eyes .
that' s right , yes ...
she knit all day long .
i still see her kniting with those little hands ...
he took his sister to stay with him .
she had some terrain , and he wanted it , this terrain .
he told her : " it' s not me , it' s the boy , your giving the land to him .
i felt sorry for her .
i liked her .
if she won' t give you the land , i' il send her away .
she , she told me : " your father is rapacious . " " and my daughters , then ?
what will they say , my sons in law if i' il give you the land ?
and then , one day , she had a heart attack .
i look at her , me touche ses small cold hands ...
auntie ...
auntie !
what did you do ?
hey , you , get up !
damn you , you and your mother !
why you keep silent ?
that' s what i needed , to buy you a coffin ...
why you keep silent ?
listen , we won' t call the priest .
we' il take her at the edge of the field .
don' t tell anybody that she died .
or maybe we ' il burry her right there , under the tree ...
but in fact she was alive .
i was really glad that she didn' t die .
i made her a herb tea ...
some savage mint with some sugar , that was all we had .
i wet her lips .
a spoonful for mom ...
one for dad ...
one for me ...
damn you , you and your mother !
and now , what am i gonna do with the coffin ?
i already paid for it ...
what , should i feed the pigs in it ?
i' il kill you , i' il kill you both .
c' mon , dad , we' il settle that .
and the little girl , what happened to her ?
the little girl ?
she was swinging over there ...
when we fought she fell from swing ...
i think , i don' t know for sure .
she died because of the fall ?
i don' t know , maybe ...
or maybe she died one year later ...
they say that her mother buried her there , under the tree .
but i don' t think so , actually i know nothing about it .
do you remember her name ?
no .
what did you do afterwards ?
the little girl ?
she was swinging over there ...
when we fought she fell from swing ...
i think , i don' t know for sure .
she died because of the fall ?
i don' t know , maybe ...
or maybe she died one year later ...
please , put some clothes on you , it' s getting cold .
please , let me bring it to you , professor .
that' s how we eat them , cold .
avicola .
the first time , two civilians came .
they asked me if i knew how a psychiatric patient behaves .
a madman . " of course , i know . " we had one in my hometown in giurgiu . " and how did he behave ? " " show me how he behaved .
he behaved this way , that way .
it was like a test , like you do with actors , for your movies .
ah no , god protected me , i' m not in themovie business .
oh yeah , got it .
i concentrated to imitate that madman , or even better , if possible .
bravo !
what else did you see him doing ?
yes " , i said .
there was also vasilica .
he had legs like that .
vasilica was getting mad when someone irritated him ... " epileptics , did you see any ?
ah yes , i sure did .
they do what ?
they do that : " they jump in the air , the eyes rolled upwards , with foam in their mouth .
foam in their mouth ?
how' s that ?
they retain the foam in their mouth first
and they let it go out later .
some of them don' t have foam , they just roll their eyes upwards , that' s all .
i never had that , so i didn' t know ,
but i concentrated ...
i concentrated .
bravo " !
that they said to me .
and they laughed .
they' d liked well my number . " you act very well .
what was their interest to make you act like a madman ?
all day long , everybody must believe
that you are a ' mentally ill person ' " , they told me .
it takes a lot of talent , in the work camp i steered the artistic brigade ,
i acted in plays .
there ws a cultural committee with the actor mircea septilici there .
he died in canada , he even sent me a picture postcard from there .
go search the postcard for me !
the actor horia caciulescu was there , too . ,
he had his legs like the letter x , like vasilica .
they were writing the play .
and i saw it , aprooved it and played it . " sam the worker " , that' s how they called the play .
up , jump , malagamban up , jump , don' t stay
up , jump , in one foot mister exploiter
now' s my turn to make you jump !
go get the photo .
and one evening , i hear : " that' s it , tonight we get the job started .
they' re bringing some guys that have killed soldiers in the mountains .
you know what have you to do ?
i was told that you master the methods to make them speak the truth .
but no , i don' t know any method .
nobody told me that .
what should i do ?
how' s that , comrade cocos , didn' t he tell you anything ?
i don' t know cocos .
then we achieved nothing ! " " nobody goes out of here alive before they spit everything they know .
they began cooking them , but they got tired fast .
they were stupid , they knew nothing about torture .
a prisoner began to yell .
the militiaman arrives and says : " please , stop this torture .
here we don' t torture them like that , it' s forbidden .
you are not allowed to do that the patients must be relaxed .
and you irritate them !
there was nobody to form me .
and i , i' d never investigated .
then , a lady arrived .
she was a major .
she initiated me .
she was 30 old .
she seemed 15 .
a kid .
dounia .
she was from bessarabie .
dounia ...
she brought the materials : a torturer' s chair
where we could attach their hands and feet .
but they needed the person to serve as a ...
guinea pig .
there was a certain banu there ,
a prisoner of common law , he was incurable .
he wasn' t even aware any more ,
he was in the coma .
let' s sacrifice this one " , she says . " we' il take him as an example .
to show me how to knock with the pencil .
and you struck them where ?
on their testicles .
yes , on testicles .
yes , yes , on testicles .
a long , non cut pencil , with which we struck them on their testicles .
after she showed me on that prisoner ,
i still had enough to learn .
she said to me : " in time , you will become an expert .
i became an expert later ...
you found it ?
what is this doing here ?
are you blind ?
answer me , are you blind ?
ok , darling , it' s allright .
keep searching it .
i became an expert later ...
nobody is born learned .
every evening , from 11 hours ,
the inquiry started again until 4 5 in the morning .
the first one on which i experimented didn' t survive for long .
in the morning he entered in a coma , he didn' t say anything more .
his testicles darkened , inflated , inflated a lot ...
it was inexplicable .
who' s this woman ?
who , that one ?
a colleague , from timisoara .
irma .
i' d become a machine , a brainless robot ...
and this one ?
it' s the same .
and all these are near this tree ?
yes , near this tree .
what wabout the prisoner , burned in the oven by stanciugel ?
yes , in the oven of the brickyard .
there were some gipsies working there , gipsies from transylvania .
they' ve argued with stanciugel .
the gypsy was offended , he' s beed called " colored " .
to the appeal in the morning , an absentee . " where is he ?
they searched for him all day long .
in the morning , i said to the commander in chief : " he burned , sir , in the oven .
don' t say a word " , he told me . " we' il report him as fugitive .
it' s stanciugel who threw him in the oven ?
i know nothing about it .
would you excuse me for a minute .
that night , two gipsies from turda were feeding the oven .
just like that , they' ve seen a big greenish flame .
no smoke , just flames .
i think these two did it ,
he couldn' t have thrown himself in there .
just my two cents ...
the next day , people of the constanta public prosecutor' s office arrived .
stanciugel comes to me , he says to me : " don' t tell anyone that somebody told you it smelled like burnt flesh .
stanciugel asked you for that ?
yes .
because that smelt bad .
everybody could smell it .
the prisoners went to the toilet , behind the sheds .
all those who' ve been there that night smelled that .
the guard awakened me : " tandara
tandara , that smells burned , here in the back !
i went there , it smelled , yes , and some bones were burning .
i removed from the fire a man' s leg .
the morning , i told the commander . " it' s nothing " , he sayd . " you dreamed about it .
sir , but ...
you keep your mouth shut !
don' t say a word !
understood ?
do you know the name of the burned ?
i knew it .
i forgot .
most of us were criminals .
there was brganu there .
there was badea there .
there was one sentenced for 15 years .
he' d killed his mother .
and then epuran ...
we were numerous . heartless persons .
why do you say you were heartless ?
for example ,
the dead ones were in a bathroom on some grids .
we couldn' t have left them on the floor .
we arranged them on some grids .
naked .
and we played with them ...
how' s that , you played ?
we were not mentally healthy ...
a mentally healthy person wouldn' t have done such things .
how did you play with the dead ?
as the girl had taught us .
we played to stick them with one' s nose in the ass of the other one ,
stiff as they were .
they were light , ' bout 40 kilos ...
the skin on bones .
the skin which dangled , we called that ...
the " apron " !
bravo !
he didn' t forget that .
yes , the apron .
the chain of your dog it' s so short ...
my colleague throwed them into the cart .
i ran away rather that carrying them
however , that was 20 kilos for him , 20 kilos for the other one .
the strong ones among us were having fun to throw them in the air , as high as possible .
they fell again , with their heads on the arms of the cart ,
there was a whole mess ...
the officers of the securitate , the corporals came to assist ...
and they' d a good laugh , they joked .
and we laughed , too .
did anybody count them , these dead ?
did you know their names ?
what names ?
count them ...
why ?
we threw a blanket over them and they left in that cart !
the transport was made at night .
yes .
during the day , the excavator dug the hole .
i' m telling you , we were true brutes .
but you were also forced to do it .
forced ?
nobody froced us !
i agreed !
they didn' t threaten me .
i swear in front of god , it would be a lie to say that i was forced ..
in 51 , when they' ve told me they' il release me ,
you know what i said ?
i said like that : " not , please , keep me here some more time .
you understand ? " keep me here some more time .
this means i liked it , madam .
what do you think , am i crazy ?
over there , nobody ever tried to open your eyes ?
didn' t you ever have time to remain alone and face your sins , your decay ?
why did the questioning took so long ?
10 12 hours for a page or two ?
in which tortures have you participated
as witness and player ?
you don' t want to tell us anything more ?
the evening of my departure ,
when they let me go ,
i turned and i saw the barracks ,
it was as if i left my own home .
i was crying .
what am i going to do ?
it was so good in there !
it was not perfect ...
but it was my home , and i liked it .
you said that you searched for some of your colleagues .
executioners as me .
i went to find them , yes . " c' mon , let' s confess " , i told them .
what did they answer ? " are you crazy ?
do i look crazy like you
i' ve children to raise " , they said . " you want my kids to leave me ?
listen , the communiste will regain to power .
that one , he raises pigs . " wasn' t it good under the communists ? " didn' t we manage to live well ?
another one , vasile , his daughter is a school teacher in bucharest . " when my daughter will hear that " , he told me ...
i want to die in my own bed .
and his daughter , does she know what he was ?
of course she knows .
and your child , he knows ?
just go there and keep searching over there .
you' re stuck here , or what ...
your child , he knows ?
my child is very upset against me , madam .
in the recording done with the professor ,
you said that you couldn' t resist more than a month .
at the end of a month , i felt i was turning mad .
once , i stayed there two months .
did you also tortured common law prisonners ?
that arrived .
i heard you also tortured teenagers .
is it true ?
once we had a pilot , a young boy , practically a child .
he attempted to flee with the plane .
i did him a torpedoing .
what' s that , torpedoing ?
electrocution on his feet .
that is electric shock treatment .
same as for bees ?
yes , same as for bees .
later , she kicked himon his testicles .
he wasn' t dead yet , but he couldn' t speak anymore .
then she burned his testicules with a cigarette .
always that girl , she was doing it ?
yes , her ...
other times , made me do it ...
who made you ?
she did .
and all this time , she ...
she , what ?
about what does franz tandara dream ?
all those who did as i did , they dream the same way .
very bad dreams .
i dream about those who , when we remained alone ...
fell on their knees and implored me to spare them .
my only concern was not to leave any marks .
there was one , marin constantinescu ,
who took charge of our education .
he said : " we appear on certain lists
saying that we are commiting crimes agains humanity .
you understand ?
crimes against humanity .
be careful not to commit crimes against humanity " .
no blood .
hidden .
no blood .
it was its favorite expression . " no blood .
then we gave up kicking the testicles ,
as it' s been a crime against humanity .
then the woman came and showed us
how to beat them with sandbags .
they were stockings filled with sandat the bottom .
they left no track ,
not even red spots on the skin .
but the lungs detached .
the person was spitting and then died .
what else do you dream of ?
i dream about the patients in room n2 in the hospital .
about 20 beds .
there were madmen , real ones ,
but there were also a few , one or two , brought for questioning .
my task was to prevent them from sleeping all night long .
somebody came to me and told me : " look , the fat one in the bed number x
as soon as he fell asleep , i struck him with the sandbag .
there were about 20 patients in that room ,
well , not even one ...
you understand ?
not even one ...
ever tried to help another , none ever jumped at me .
naturally , i had a big bat under my bed .
how much did they pay you for what you were doing over there ?
5 000 lei .
what was a regular salary , at that time ?
a few hundreds of lei .
but i couldn' t do it for more than 3 months .
how did you return in there ?
they relieved me of duty during the winter of ' 55 .
the night of christmas 1955 .
i was very confused .
my place , it was over there ...
i couldn' t live with my freedom .
freedom terrified me .
how much did you remain outside ?
about nine months .
unfortunately , i didn' t have any talent for foreign languages .
what' s the connection here ?
if i' d learned a foreign language ,
they would have sent me abroad .
to do what ?
to terminate one or another .
and then i' d have returned ...
but , i didn' t have talent for languages , so i remained here .
after almost one year of wandering through the country ...
i returned to them .
today , almost 50 years later ,
do you imagine yourself outside the danger of killing a man ?
no , i don' t feel outside of this danger .
on the contrary , i' m afraid that i could do it again .
you smoke ?
yes , a lot , more than two packs a day .
and during all this interview , you' ve been able to refrain yourself ?
i' ve a lot of will .
yes , i have that .
of what are you afraid ?
didn' t you become more ...
more human ?
non , i haven' t become more human .
my nerves have weakened .
i' m not capable anymore even to bandage a wound ,
i can' t bear seeing the blood anymore ...
maybe , more human , or rather a nervous breakdown .
my wife , she knows about it .
she never asks me to sacrifice a chicken .
but my daughter in law , she' s deliberately doing it .
laughing , she says : " who' s going to kill the chicken ?
a man should do that ...
yes , my nerves are weakened .
i even wanted to see a psychiatrist , to tell if i' m sick .
rumania !
tandara , informer , " " the one selling the country away
tandara , little dick " " we' re going to fuck you , man
tandara , you' ve got no balls " " you sell the country for dollars
the sold , " " out of the country !

good afternoon , miss .
mr. professor , i greet you .

i told you to calm down , didn' t i ?

you want to confess ?
go see a priest , and confess .

it' s close .
go and confess . " please , forgive me , father , as i have sinned . " " i played with the dead ,
i fucked them in the ass .
but no , you don' t go cto see the priest , you dickhead .
you go to radio dustbin .
you do it to your whole homeland !
you sell it !
your homeland , that' s all you have .
you sell it and you shit on it .
how much did they pay you for that ?
you pretend you' ve got balls .
you hang up the phone in front of mr teodoresco .
you hang up the phone in front of him ?
hey , dickhead , do you see my pals over there ?
you see them ?
dickhead , we' re going to set you on fire .
shouldn' t we do it ...
we' re going to see the game now .
we kick their ass , and on the way back we set you on fire .

he is very angry .
very angry on me .

dirty blind bitch !
old bag , blow me .
kiss my ass !
come on , my baby my baby ...
there , there , stop crying , i am here .
i' m going to bring you some honey .
me , i steal everything .
this profession , i' ve stolen it from a hungarian .
he said : " the profession must be stolen , if you' re smart . " " don' t steal anything except for the profession and the knowledge .
and i stole !
go bring me the small axe .
it' s a metaphor .
because if i stole your hive ...
sure that it' s a metaphor .
it' s true .
it' s a metaphor .
it' s what i say .
it' s a metaphor ...
don' t steal the goods of others .
but the profession , steal it .
it' s a metaphor .
the ancient greeks said : " the beekeeping and the theft , they' re sacred .
you read that somewhere ?
i read it , mr luci .
it' s a paradox , tandara .
i know .
what ' that white flag doing here ?
it' s the flag of beekeepers from giurgiu .
before , i wandered all over the country with my bees .
now , i' m old .
i took my hives with me .
it' s so beautiful , our country !
why go somewhere else , when you have such a beautiful country ?
i' ve never been abroad , not even to bulgaria .
you' re allright , my beautiful ?
you' re beautiful .
are you beautiful !
i' d like to ask you another question .
you said you tortured a dying person ,
you " practiced " on him .
with a woman .
which woman ?
the same woman ?
stop asking those questions .
please , stop torturing him like that .
sorry . " sorry , sorry ...
in your opinion , how many persons died like that ?
maybe a hundred , only with me .
you said a hundred ?
on the tape recorded with the professor ,
you said you' ve done a " good job " of which you' re ashamed .
it was going well , the job .
i was good at what i was doing .
i couldn' t do it anymore , they started loving me .
loving " ?
who loved you ?
those were the good things .
and there are other things i cannot speak of ...
it' s too hard .
why did you keep those pictures ?
which relation you' ve ...
madam , don' t you understand ?
do i speak chinese ?
leave the damn pictures alone !
you' d better knock him in the head with this axe , please , kill him , but stop torturing him .
i' m begging on my knees .
your train , when is it ?
at 8 8 : 15 at 8 : 23 ...
well , then , make sure you don' t miss it !
c' mon , help me clear the table , they must be in a hurry .
here' s the hatchet you were seekeing .
she doesn' t want me to tell anything , and neither does her son .
nobody wants ...
the honey , are you still eating it ?
no , you' re not .
she is very angry on me .
his son is angry , too .
they are all very angry ...
everybody' s very angry ...
i' m very confused .
i wanted to be judged by somebody .
i can not be my own judge ...
i seeked the chindren of those whom i' d made suffer . " please , return tomorrow ... or on wednesday ...
nobody wants to listen .
what should i do ?
wait to die so god judges me ?
maybe .
but i want to do something over here , too .
to do something good , as of the evil , i made enough of it .
i seeked the professor , some 5 years ago ,
to the association of the former prisoners .
poor man , he fell asleep again ...
he is very tired .
i wanted those who sufferd to judge me ...
then when i' ve seen that not even him seem to care ...
i keep silent .
what did i tell you ?
it' s nothing , nothing compared to what happened .
one day , madam , you children will be grateful .
they' il be proud of the example given by your husband .
oh , madam not even my grandson ...
when he will be a grown up , he will not forgive me ...
oh , such an idiot grandfather ...
oh , what a disgusting grandfather ...
tandara , come here !
stay there , on your four paws , you stupid dog .
i doubt if they' il refrain from making me sleep in the doghouse .
that , i seized it from a prisoner .
a sas , named reiter .
he had it attached to the bars of the cell' s window .
he never wantd to say how he got it ...
may he rest in peace .
it' s in this train that i embarqued my old aunt , 50 years ago .
i was a child then .
i liked her .
the second time , she couldn' t escape the death .
it' s me , i killed her .
how did you kill her ?
take her far from here " , said my father . " i don' t want to see her anymore .
and where should i take her ?
in hell , or wherever you want .
don' t return her here anymore ,
or i' il kill you . " " i' il kill you , and i' il also kill her " " i' il kill you both . " " stay here !
don' t you dare to return home , you old whitch !
if you keep following me , i' il kill you .
then she cursed me : " may the plague take you all .
why do you curse me ?
i didn' t do anything to you .
i believed that you had you good heart , that you loved me .
what can i do ?
it' s your brother ...
from time to time , she turned her head like a beaten dog
and then , she saw me there ...
stayng there , with my bat .
she understood that if she turns back ,
if she doesn' t obey ,
i' d beat her up .
nobody ever heard of her again .
wolves may have eaten here over there , on these hills .
thats how they all died .
the last one to die was dounia .
alcoholic , in the last degree .
she burned alive because of a cigarette .
or maybe she set herself on fire , then threw herself through the window ...
i don' t remember anymore .
i' d like to ask you another question .
you said you tortured a dying person ,
you " practiced " on him .
with a woman .
which woman ?
the same woman ?
stop asking those questions .
please , stop torturing him like that .
sorry . " sorry , sorry ...
in your opinion , how many persons died like that ?
maybe a hundred , only with me .
you said a hundred ?
