# our house , our house , our house is burning down
# our house , our house , our house is burning down
it must have been the wiring .
that isn' t what the fire department thinks .
dean , if my boys say it was the wiring , you gotta believe them .
dean , school ought to be more careful .
we got a big game comin ' up .
i don' t want my boys worried about where they' re gonna live .
they should have thought of that before they burnt their house down .
what' s done is done .
where am i gonna put my athletes ?
the freshman dorm ?
what about the students there now ?
all right .
thanks to faulty wiring , we have no place to live .
right ?
right !
these freshmen are sittin ' pretty in there !
so as of now , that dorm is ours !
right ?
yeah !
any room you want .
ready ?
break !
don' t come back !
there' s your roommate , pal !
if everyone follows directions , we can manage this move with as little inconvenience as possible .
all right , men .
i want everybody to listen up .
we' re movin ' out , and i mean now !
move it !
move it !
move , move , move !
get outta here !
all right , listen up .
i' m gonna see to it that each and every one of you is taken care of .
you will be provided with the best possible food , shelter and accommodation .

nerds !
nerds !
nerds !
nerds !
nerds !
nerds !
nerds !
i know this move has been sudden for all of you , and you' re probably all still very disoriented .
i do want to assure you that this move is in no way permanent .
it' s only temporary .
as you see , we' ve provided accommodations for you that are ... quite acceptable .
it' il be a nice place for you to enjoy your studies .
i don' t even wanna go to college .
you have a special gift .
you need college to develop it .
i wanna be with people my own age .
you will be with people your own age when you' re older .
but you can' t drop me off in a gymnasium .
it looks like we' re refugees from a war .
we gotta go now , honey .
your dad has an appointment .
bye , son .
it is really very comfortable here .
is there anyone here with allergies ?
me too .
uh , for those of you who do have allergies , you can request a foam rubber pillow .
also , there' s a television for your viewing pleasure .
it is a black and white television .
more good news .
because of the housing situation , we are allowing the freshman class to join and live in fraternities .
yeah !
the fraternities will select their members tomorrow .
all right !
enough of this social bullshit .
grab a cot .
move it or lose it !
go , son .
move !
move , move , move , move , move !
and the delta kappa gamma fraternity has selected as its new members
oliver scott and bill daniels .
for those of you who weren' t selected by any fraternities , you won' t be left out in the cold .
you can stay here in the gym for as long as you like .
or at least until basketball season .

dooley , edward .
yozonski , yosef .
wait a second .
are you sure about this ?
gilbert , yes .
come on .
hi , girls .
are you guys looking to join a sorority ?
a sorority ?
no !
we need some help .
we figured pretty girls like you might be able to suggest a fraternity .
choosing the right fraternity can be one of the most important decisions in a man' s life .
for sure .
guys like you have to choose very carefully .
definitely .
tell us what frat do you think is us .
you guys are alpha betas all the way .
totally .
for sure .

wait .
aren' t alpha betas , like , all jocks and face men ?
yes .
but you guys have got that certain something i know they' d be interested in .
i' il tell ' em you' re coming .
should we ask for a particular alpha beta ?
stan gable .
and you' re ... ?
betty childs .
thank you , betty .
ms childs .
maybe if you' re not busy sometime we could have a cup of coffee or somethin ' .
come on , pal .
i can' t believe you asked her out .
you know , gilbert , if we get in , maybe we can have our old room back .
these guys will never accept us .
why wouldn' t they ?
these are the alpha betas .
they' re the football players .
i don' t think ms childs would have sent us over here if she didn' t think we had a decent chance of getting in .
yes ?
hi .
tell stan gable that we' re the guys that betty childs sent over .
follow me , boys .
gilbert !
welcome .
hi .
hey !
you guys seem pretty cool .

it' s no use .
it' s inhuman .
it' s not inhuman .
only humans can be inhuman .
here , let me show you .
working with a computer' s great .
i mean , it' s godlike , in a way , cos you can have complete control .
that' s good .
thanks .
you know , some people , they can create with their hands .
but when you' re working with a computer , you gotta build something with your mind .
if you' re good , you can do somethin ' no one' s ever seen before .
it' s a definite high .

judy .
hi , judy .
gilbert .

excuse me .
ah , thank you very much .
ok , takashi , show me your cards .

two and four kings .
that' s good , yes ?
no , you got too many kings .
so you gotta get rid of these here .
take three of these kings out , and replace them with ... three fresh cards .
oh , ok .
thank you .
when do i deal ?
you gotta win a hand first .
i told you we' d find a better place .
yeah .
this is way better than the dorm .
it says " nerds get out .
what is a nerd ?
we are .
i don' t know what this world is comin ' to .
you see that man over there ?
we arrested him for mopery .
what' s mopery ?
exposing yourself to a blind person .
i' m sorry about your windows , fellas .
it' s out of my jurisdiction .
sounds like a fraternity prank .
there' s only one organisation that can handle this .
what organisation is that ?
the greek council .
our next order of business : new membership .
earl , show the petitioners in , please .
shh !
kneel , gentlemen .
you are the gentlemen who wish to form a fraternity ?
yes , sir .
gentlemen , as president of the greek council ,
i' m sorry to inform you that your membership has been denied .
excuse me , but ... why ?
according to our charter , you must have a national fraternity as your sponsor .
do you have one ?
no .
i' m afraid he' s right .
but with a national sponsor , we' re in , right ?
right , right .
so i guess we' il see you in about , say ... 20 years .
dear sirs , thank you for applying to delta kappa gamma .
we have gone over your application , and it wasn' t even close .
ln the future , we recommend that you not include a group photo .
that' s 29 rejections so far .
did we send pictures to everybody ?
yeah .
everybody except for ...
lambda lambda lambda .
here' s one that will see us .
lambda lambda lambda ?
yeah .
they' re gonna love us .
as you know , we have no chapter at adams college , which is why we agreed to see you .
but i must tell you , gentlemen , you have very little chance of becoming tri lambdas .
i' m in a difficult situation here .
i mean , after all ... you' re nerds .
according to your bylaws , you have to take us on a 60 day trial basis .
i beg your pardon ?
according to your bylaws ...
he' s right , un .
any group that petitions can become a probationary tri lamb chapter .
may i see that , please ?
thank you .
well , gentlemen ... you are now probationary tri lambs .
hey .
great , un .
why don' t we have a party ?
you can celebrate with us and observe us to make sure we' re tri lamb material , ok ?
great .
we won' t let you down .
we' il have the highest grade point average of any chapter you' ve got .
we certainly won' t discriminate .
our chapter will be open to people of all races and creeds .
and sexual orientation .
wonderful .
hi .
remember me ?
no .
well , we' re having a party saturday night .
would you like to come ?
no .
oh , well ...

we' il put the bar here , the hors d' oeuvres over there , and we' il pass the cheese puffs .
oh , good .
that sounds expensive .
this party' s important .
if we don' t impress the tri lambs , we' il never get in .
maybe we can have robster craws .
what the fuck are " robster craws " ?
have any of you got dates , besides gilbert ?
i do .
yeah , but that' s with a guy .
what about you , booger ?
i' ve been out combing the high schools all day .
maybe we should cancel the party .
no , we can' t cancel the party .
un jefferson' s coming .

it must be the music .
i' il put on something he' il like better .
lewis ?
un ?
great party .
thanks .
where are all those sorority girls you have dates with ?
you know women , they' re probably just being fashionably late .
the pis aren' t gonna show .
they stood us up .
yeah .

you think they' il come ?
they' re really spontaneous people .
i' il call ' em .

# i' m sayin ' you gotta be ...
yeah !
this party isn' t going very well , is it ?
i don' t know why everybody' s so uptight .

yeah .
you wanna switch glasses ?
we almost have the same prescription .
yeah .
um , would you like to dance ?
yeah .
yeah , well , when i was in high school , i was thinking mostly of the aerospace field .
but then when i got into college , i decided i wanted something more challenging .
so , um , i switched to computers , and now aerodynamics is just sort of a hobby .
wait , wait .
no , no , wait .
would you rather live in the ascendancy of a civilisation or during its decline ?
poindexter , do you wanna fuck or not ?
agh !
you know , if we get into lambda lambda lambda , we could be partners in the homecoming carnival .
that' d be so great .
yeah .
this party sure worked out well .
# old macdonald had a farm
# e l e l o
# and on that farm he had some pigs
# e l e l o
we thought you could use some more pigs for your party , nerds .
# with an oink oink here and an oink oink there
# here an oink , there an oink , everywhere an oink oink
# old macdonald had a farm
# e l e l o
we' il never get into lambda lambda lambda now .
those jocks ruined everything .
i say we blow their fucking houses up .
no .
we can' t resort to violence .
that' il just bring us down to their level .
what do we do ?
we gotta beat ' em at their own game .
we' ve gotta become the best fraternity on campus .
you know , if we win that homecoming carnival , we can take over the presidency of the greek council .
that would drive ' em crazy .
but , gilbert , if we don' t get approved by the tri lambs , we won' t even be a fraternity .
i say we blow the fuckers up .
no .
we can' t do that .
but you' re right .
their action tonight demands an immediate retaliation .
and if we don' t , we' re nothin ' but the nerds they say we are .
i know what we' re gonna do .
down , down , down .
come on .
agh !
# e l e l o
# with an oink oink here and an oink oink there
# here an oink ...

you ought to feel it when i don' t dilute it .
get them .
make a pile here .
ok .
here goes .
ok .
don' t touch , now .
here , hit this one .
ok .
looks like salad .
the key to each season is homecoming .
you win that one , you got your alumni support .
you got your alumni support , you get that jock dorm , you get the laundry money , you get the new cars .
now , this season started out fine we won some big ball games .
but we were lucky .
we can' t get soft .
we can' t sit back on our laurels .
we win homecoming , we take league .
we take league , we get a bowl bid .
it' s as simple as that .
but , gentlemen , you have got to want it .
do you want it ?
yeah !
i can' t hear you .
yeah !
we can' t let up .
we gotta stay tough .
you can do it .
you can do it .
you gotta believe that you can do it !
you gotta let them know that you want it !
i want it !
good .
shower up !
shit .
we forgot to practise .
you put what ?
liquid heat .
on their what ?
in their jocks .
that' s outrageous .
are you angry , un ?
no .
i' m not angry .
i' m glad to see you nerds ... you guys finally fought back .
you' d make a fine addition to tri lambda .
i want to welcome you aboard .
congratulations .
all right !
you' il tell the guys ?
oh , i will .
ok , everybody ready ?
ok , i focus now .
i set timer .
now say " hi , un .
hi , un .
well , i' d like to propose a toast to un jefferson , who , in his ultimate wisdom , chose to accept us into our new fraternity , lambda lambda lambda .
lambda lambda lambda .
before we take this matter to a vote , i would like it clearly stated in the record ...
miss childs ... that the evidence is overwhelmingly against the alpha betas , and i urge that they be found guilty .
point of order .
dean ulich , i am an alpha beta , and i know that no member of my fraternity could have perpetrated such a callous , heinous act against the nerds ... or the tri lambs .
therefore , i feel a vote at this time would be , shall we say , premature .
premature ?
yes .
you see , instead ,
i am going to organise a special , blue ribbon , fact finding commission , made up of myself and ...
miss betty childs .
we will get to the bottom of this dastardly deed .
wait a minute , you can' t get away with this .
oh , no , i' m afraid i can .
you see , only the president of the greek council can call a vote .
that' s completely unfair .
this is bullshit !
meeting adjourned .
guys , we are never gonna get a fair shake as long as stan gable is president .
the only way to become president is to win the homecoming carnival .
that' s right , arnold .
and that' s exactly what we' re gonna do .
i take great pleasure in officially opening this year' s homecoming carnival .
the overall winner will be determined by total points from : number one field events , number two the charity fund raising booth , and number three the musical show and skit competition .
and now , let the games begin !
ok .
the object of the race is to complete 20 laps around the track , while stopping every lap for a mandatory pit stop , at which time the driver will chug a beer .
you don' t have a fucking chance , nerd .
oh , thank you .
good luck to you , too , burke .
fuck off .
gentlemen , start your engines .
this is trichloromethalene .
it counters all effects of alcohol in your system .
