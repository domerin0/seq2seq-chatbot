especially when i twirl them like this .
i' m h 2 o intolerant .
ah choo !
i' m obnoxious .

he wasn' t going to go .
he was too afraid .
no , i wasn' t .
this does not concern you , kids ... and you' re lucky i don' t tell your parents .
you know you can' t swim well .
i can swim fine , dad , ok ?
no , it' s not ok .
you shouldn' t be near here .
ok , i was right .
you' il start school in a year or two .

just because you' re scared of the ocean ...
clearly , you' re not ready ...
clearly , you' re not ready ... and you' re not coming back until you are .
you think you can do these things ... but you just can' t , nemo !
i hate you .
* there' s *
nothing to see .
gather .
over there .
excuse me .
is there anything i can do ?
i am a scientist , sir .
is there any problem ?
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to interrupt things .
he isn' t a good swimmer , and it' s a little too soon ... for him to be out here unsupervised .
i can assure you , he' s quite safe with me .
i' m sure he is , but you have a large class ... and he can get lost from sight if you' re not looking .
i' m not saying you' re not looking .
i' m not saying you' re not looking .
oh , my gosh !
nemo' s swimming out to sea !
nemo !
what do you think you' re doing ?

lf ... you are able to swim through ...
the ring of fire !
turn on the ring of fire !
you said you could do it .

sharkbait !
ooh ... ba ba do .
sharkbait' s one of us now , agreed ?
agreed .
we can' t send him to his death .
darla' s coming in five days .
so , what are we going to do ?
i' il tell you what we' re gonna do ... we' re gonna get him out of here .
we' il help him escape .
escape ?

you see that filter ?
yeah .
you' re the only one who can get in and out of that thing .
we need you to take a pebble inside there ... and jam the gears .
you do that , and this tank' s gonna get ... filthier and filthier by the minute .
pretty soon , the dentist' il have to clean the tank ... and when he does , he' il take us out of the tank ... put us in individual baggies ... then we' il roll ourselves down the counter ... out the window , off the awning ... into the bushes , across the street ... and into the harbor !
it' s foolproof .
who' s with me ?
aye !
aye !
i think you' re nuts .
no offense , kid , but you' re not the best swimmer .
he' s fine .
he can do this .

mr. fish , did you die ?
sorry , i was a little vague on the details .
so , where are you going ?
you see , my son was taken .
my son was taken away from me .
no way .
what happened ?
no , no , kids .
i don' t want to talk about it .
aww !
please ?
please ?
well , ok .
i live on this reef a long , long way from here .
this is gonna be good .
i can tell .
and my son nemo ...
see , he was mad at me .
and maybe he wouldn' t have done it ... if i hadn' t been so tough on him .
i don' t know .
anyway , he swam out in the open water to this boat ... and when he was out there , these divers appeared ... and i tried to stop them , but the boat was too fast .
so , we swam out in the ocean to follow them ...
they couldn' t stop ' em .
and then nemo' s dad ... he swims out to the ocean , and they bump into ... ... three ferocious sharks .
he scares away the sharks by blowing ' em up !
golly , that' s amazing .
and then dives thousands of feet ... ... straight down into the dark .
it' s wicked dark down there .
you can' t see a thing .
how' s it going , bob ?
and the only thing they can see down there ... ... is the light from this big , horrible creature ... with razor sharp teeth .
nice parry , old man .
and then he has to blast his way ...
so , these two little fish have been ... searching the ocean for days on the east australian current .
which means that he may be on his way here right now .
that should put him in sydney harbor ... ... in a matter of days .
i mean , it sounds like ... this guy is gonna stop at nothing ... ... till he finds his son .
i sure hope he makes it .
that' s one dedicated father , if you ask me .

marlin ?
marlin !
the little clownfish from the reef .
it' s my dad !
he took on a shark !
i heard he took on three .
three sharks ?
that' s 4, 800 teeth !
after you were taken by diver dan over there ... your dad followed the boat like a maniac .
really ?
he' s swimming , giving it all he' s got ... and then three gigantic sharks capture him ... and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet ... and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth !
he ties this demon to a rock , and what' s his reward ?
he gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest !
now he' s with a bunch of sea turtles on the e. a. c ... and the word is he' s headed this way right now ... to sydney !
wow !

all righty , mr. smartypants .
and it' s orange and small and white stripes ...
and it' s orange and small and white stripes ...

and the next one , just a guess , me .
that' s just scary .
wait , wait , wait .
i have definitely seen this floating speck before .
that means we' ve passed it before ... and that means we' re going in circles ... and that means we' re not going straight !
hey , hey !
get to the surface .
we' il figure it out up there .
let' s go !
hey !
relax .
what ?
take a deep breath .

let' s see .
ok , no one there .
nope .
nada .
there' s somebody .
hey !
excuse ...
dory , dory , dory !
now it' s my turn .
i' m thinking of something dark and mysterious .
it' s a fish we don' t know .
if we ask it directions ... it could ingest us and spit out our bones !
what is it with men and asking for directions ?
i don' t want to play the gender card right now .
let' s play the " let' s not die " card .
you want to get out of here ?
of course i do .
