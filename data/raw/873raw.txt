hello .
i' m the mother of the notorious " crossroads killer .
when my son comes home after one of his famous crimes ... his clothes are just filthy .
where are the clothes your son wore ... at the time of the murder ?
right here .
sparkling clean .
no trace of blood .
or guts .
unbelievable .
ecce homo .
it' s unbelievable .
a group of armed shiites was captured here in madrid today .... according to police sources .
a local shiite spokesman living in madrid ... stated that the commando group was acting on its own ... without any connection to the shiite community .
the same police sources ... promise to release additional information ... within a few hours ... after the interrogations are completed .
oh , my book !
ivan , i have to speak to you .
it' s urgent .

i' m going out to look for you now .

your mother' s too much .
i' m sorry , marisa .
and that slut in the window !

weren' t you going to use the phone ?
why don' t you use it ?
let' s go .
gather everything and let' s go .
something' s come up that concerns us both .
i must talk to you before you leave .
throw that away !
god , i hope he called .
pepa , it' s 5 . : 00a . m.
i' m across from your place , and you' re still not home .
i don' t know which end is up anymore !
i can' t explain over the phone .
what a pest !
i' il tell you one thing
i don' t understand , because if you had a problem
you' il feel guilty about this !
it' s you .
i called a million times .
you' re a drag !
don' t say that , or i' il leave .
come on in .
i' ve been out all night .
so have l .
let' s have some coffee .
going somewhere ?
no .
ivan' s leaving me .
we' re doing great .
my life' s a mess .
mine too .
problems at work ?
no .
i couldn' t tell you on the phone .
the phone !
i just ripped it out !
damn !
i' il have to call the phone company .
can i stay here ?
i' m in big trouble , pepa !
fix the coffee , then we' il talk .
you' re a pain today !
what ?
don' t call me a pain !
i' m feeling very vulnerable .
my god .
looks like the work of terrorists .
oh , the phone
this just isn' t normal .
god , the cops .
i' m dead .
hello .
open up .
we know you' re in there .
what do you want ?
to see the apartment .
which one ?
this one .
why ?
to rent it .
the real estate agency sent us .
in that case
come in .
the owner will be back in a minute .
carlos .
yes , honey ?
it' s too high .
darling , it' s a penthouse .
and expensive .
super expensive .
but it' s a great location .
i want a real house , and this is not a real house .
the girl is right .
don' t call me a girl .
carlos .
yes , my love ?
you call this great too ?
christ .
pepa is really something .
let' s go .
come on .
drop that !
you' re a cop , right ?
my carlos a cop ?
very funny !
i' m no cop .
isn' t that your father ?
nice people don' t touch what is not theirs .
why is this here ?
i don' t know .
do you know her ?
that' s pepa .
you know pepa ?
not personally , no .
well , here i am .
you know who i am ?
did you see the bed ?
i think so , ma' am .
you know who i am ?
since last night .
but don' t call me ma' am .
ivan sent you for his bag ?
no , the realtor sent us .
what a coincidence .
i' m glad to meet you anyway .
this is marisa .
who ?
oh , hello .
i' m his fiance .
very nice .
i' m his father' s ex lover .
pepa , listen
this is candela .
pleased to meet you .
carlos , please .
pardon the mess .
my life' s been hectic lately .
can you fix telephones ?
i ... can try .
come with me .
this one' s out of order ... and i' m expecting a call from your dad .
candela , make some coffee .
we have to go .
yeah .
good idea .
don' t be rude .
this is my house .
we' ve got to talk .
it can' t be that urgent !
have you any tools ?
yes , in the kitchen .
i' il go get them .
is this any time for repairs ?
don' t you recognize her ?
she was in the phone booth last night .
i hadn' t noticed .
if you don' t want me here , say so .
who says i don' t ?
i just learned that my ex lover has a son .
and he' s here .
shouldn' t he come first ?
but i' ve got a big problem .
okay , we' il talk .
let me know when we' re leaving .
it won' t take long .
here .
where' s ivan ?
i don' t know .
why doesn' t he call ?
i need to talk to him .
i don' t see him very much .
don' t lie .
he' s taking a trip with your mom .
my mother thinks he' s going with you .
then it' s someone else .
so that' s why he didn' t sleep at his studio !
how do you know ?
i spent all night keeping watch .
you must think i' m crazy .
no .
you' re just nervous from a lack of sleep .
you didn' t know about me ?
never .
i had no idea .
ivan never tells me anything .
i just find things out .
last night , when i saw your picture
from your dad , who doesn' t deserve you .
ivan .
that' s how i knew .
he never says anything , never admits anything ... never criticizes .
do you think i didn' t know he was cheating ?
sure , but i put up with it .
i tried talking to him civilly , but it didn' t work .
so i begged him not to lie about important things ... and to tell me if he stopped loving me .
last week , i finally got him to admit he didn' t love me .
it was like pulling teeth .
thanks for listening , since your father wouldn' t .
waiting for his call had me ready to choke myself ... with the telephone cord .
so i ripped out the phone .
you did right .
she' s gonna jump !
your friend' s jumping !
she jumped !
help !
carlos , be careful !
don' t let go of me , pepa !
oh , my god !
i can' t do it .
come on !
pull !
you could have killed yourself !
that was the idea !
i' m desperate .
so am i , and i don' t go jumping off terraces .
young people don' t know how to fight for things .
you think life is all pleasure .
well , it isn' t .
you have to suffer a lot .
pepa , please .
this isn' t the right time .
yes .
i' m sorry .
it' s because you scared me .
ivan  yes ?
i mean carlos .
bring me my tranquilizers from the kitchen .
i' m in big trouble .
i can see that .
carlos , do you love me ?
please , not now .
okay , what' s wrong ?
three months ago , i spent a weekend with a guy .
i didn' t know his name or anything , but after he left ...
i couldn' t get him out of my mind .
what happened that weekend ?
nothing special .
we fucked the whole weekend .
just thinking about it gives me goose bumps .
it was like a revelation .
like making love for the first time .
i loved it .
sex means a lot at your age .
because his life is always in danger ... he' s more intense than other guys .
i knew he' d be back , and i' d agree to anything .
he came back ?
two weeks ago ... with two more guys .
you let them all stay ?
they were with him .
they took advantage .
wait , wait .
i noticed something weird about them ... and he confessed that they were shiite terrorists .
i flipped .
i really did .
i knew it could be dangerous , but i didn' t think about it .
what' s worse , they had weapons ... and were planning to attack somewhere .
then i said to him ...
you should have told me about this .
that' s when i realized it was a ploy .
he didn' t love me .
he used me .
gazpacho .
you didn' t call the cops ?
delicious .
how could l ?
i was a hostage in my own house .
they were arrested yesterday ?
yes .
the ones on tv ?
i threw out all their stuff ... but if they confess where they were living
if they' re tortured , they might tell .
they probably won' t tell .
but if they do , the cops will want me for collaborating ... and you for not alerting them .
in my house , i collaborate with whomever i want .
i didn' t know where to go .
i couldn' t face my folks .
it' s bad enough that i became a model .
you need to see a lawyer .
i' il arrange for that .
you can' t leave now .
go to paulina morales .
the feminist ?
a feminist ?
as a woman , she' il take a personal interest .
i' il go change .
then give me her address .
why are men like that ?
i really don' t understand .
i couldn' t stand to be with a man right now .
that' s all i needed !
help me !
what happened ?
nothing .
she fell asleep .
so suddenly ?
the strangest things can happen suddenly .
you should know , candela .
it' s true .
but a minute ago
a minute ago she wanted to go home ... but since you ignored her ... she got depressed and had some gazpacho .
that made her fall asleep ?
yes .
it was spiked with barbiturates .
sorry .
we could call a doctor .
what kind of barbiturates ?
morphidal .
how many ?
twenty five or thirty .
she' il have a good sleep .
why did you do that ?
were you trying to kill yourself too ?
it was for your dad .
he loves gazpacho .
it' s no excuse ... but after waiting for hours , i just lost control .
that' s what happened to me .
it could happen to anyone .
don' t get me wrong .
i didn' t want to kill him just to make him stay .
i meant to throw it , but
i understand perfectly .
thanks .
the lawyer' s address ?
thirty one castellana .
do you mind staying ?
the house is so full of women .
i' il stay as long as you like .
thanks .
and fix the phone ?
are you okay ?
a bit shaken , but
don' t let her near the ledge .
see you later .
forget it .
hi , ana .
look what fell down from the sky .
it' s mine .
thanks .
it seemed strange just one .
be more careful !
ana was arguing with her boyfriend ... and it almost hit her head .
you again !
hope you don' t mind .
thirty one castellana .
i' m glad to see you .
my girlfriend loved the autograph .
when i tell her i saw you again , she' il think we
do you have eye drops ?
no .
sorry .
we could buy some .
that' s okay .
why didn' t i think of eyedrops ?
what a dope !
it' s working .
forget about them .
but they' re hijacking the 10 : 00 p. m. stockholm flight ... and taking it to beirut to free some shiite prisoners .
that flight will be fully booked .
we must report it .
then the cops will get me too !
i' il talk fast so they can' t trace the call .
yeah .
you have a way with words .
police precinct .
hello .
tonight' s 10 : 00 p. m. flight ... to stockholm ... will be hijacked by shiite terrorists .
thanks .
here we are .
don' t tell anyone i cried .
it' il be our secret .
good .
here ?
where it says " sign .
is paulina morales in ?
she' s not seeing anyone this afternoon .
it' s urgent .
it won' t take long .
come on .
you can arrange it .
okay .
come on .
thanks .
see you later .
wait here .
i' m coming .
can i use the phone ?
okay .
is paulina there ?
ivan ?
i' m going crazy .
stockholm .
you can go in .
of all the nerve !
she said i could come in .
i' m in a hurry .
don' t worry .
this won' t take long .
may i sit down ?
go ahead .
what' s the problem ?
a friend of mine is in trouble .
a " friend .
she got involved with a shiite terrorist .
i' m dying to smoke .
may l ?
the shoe is hers .
anyway , he showed up with two more shiites .
three shiites .
all three just moved in .
now they' ve been arrested ... and she' s scared shitless .
so she needs a lawyer .
why come to me ?
you' re a feminist .
so ?
this is clear cut chauvinism .
i' m going on a trip .
i' il recommend a colleague .
there' s not much to be done .
she must turn herself in , go to jail ... and let the jury decide her case .
i don' t understand .
she' s committed a crime .
her only crime was falling in love and being afraid .
i' d do the same .
i' m sure .
i don' t believe this !
and whom were you crying for ?
your friend ?
not over her .
you see ?
aren' t you the victim ?
yes .
i' ve also been cheated on .
by a terrorist ?
you could say that .
but not a shiite .
he' s from madrid .
i don' t give advice to the lovelorn .
you' re certainly no lawyer , you bitch !
leave , or i' il call the police !
was it helpful ?
yes .
i feel much better .
good .
what' s this doing here ?
a kid brought it and said it' s for mr. ivan .
if he wants it , let him come upstairs and show his face !
fine .
do you need some help ?
no , i don' t !
pepa , i' m here in madrid with you .
that' s all i need .
i' m also with you , and i' m so happy to see you write this card .
pepa .
he called ?
yeah .
i answered .
well ?
give me that !
i shouldn' t read your postcards .
never mind .
what did he say ?
he' s too embarrassed to see you , because ... you know who i am .
how sensitive of him !
i don' t want to see him either ... but if he wants his damn suitcase ... he' il have to come and get it !
how are the girls ?
fine .
where' s candela ?
in your room .
did anything happen ?
no , no .
did you see the lawyer ?
yes .
i' il tell you about it later .
you mind my wearing your dress ?
keep it .
it looks nicer on you .
don' t lose it again .
my shoes don' t fit you .
you saw the lawyer ?
yes .
we' re taking a trip .
running from the law like two fugitives ?
it' s best if we take a vacation away from madrid .
i sure need one .
i knew they' d lock me up ... and get you for hiding me .
nothing will happen .
we' il come back in a week .
you' il go to court and tell everything ... except for the fucking , and that' il be that .
really ?
don' t lie to me .
you know i' m naive .
the lawyer said not to worry .... just to stay in touch with her .
i' m causing so much trouble ... as if you don' t have enough of your own .
let' s water the plants now .
then we' il pack our bags .
dr. j. pardo .
test results on patient pepa marcos .
christ !
what about the animals ?
i don' t know .
your stepson was snooping around all day , spying .
it' s quite natural , but he won' t find much .
relax .
let me do that .
why ?
you feel okay ?
sure .
you two clean the cage while i water .
poor things .
you' re going to miss me .
you' re depressed .
just like me .
but you' il come along when i move .
i won' t leave you alone .
i' d be a fine one to abandon you .
she' s out cold .
let' s see .
anyway , who cares ?
too bad for her .
poor bunnies !
look .
totally dry .
pepa just has too much on her mind .
did you ever have rabbits ?
back home i had many .
i know lots about them .
look how they love turnips .
carlos , i' m sorry i teased you about your stuttering .
sometimes i' m so dumb .
forget it .
but you went a little too far .
you didn' t behave properly .
men keep taking advantage of me .
i always realize it when it' s too late .
look how the arab world treated me .
i sure didn' t deserve that .
this is lucia .
i need to see you .
i can' t .
i' m leaving town .
we have to talk .
about something that concerns us both .
if you mean ivan , i' m not interested .
then why are you going away with him ?
lady , you' re nuts !
between ivan and me , there' s nothing but pain .
i' m coming anyway .
i know where you live .
for two days everyone has been saying " no " to me .
now it' s my turn to say " no .
i must see ivan before he leaves .
look somewhere else and leave me alone !
that was mom ?
yes .
don' t be too hard on her .
the way she talks
she' s mentally ill .
she threatened to come here .
she shouldn' t see you .
and me ?
fix marisa some coffee .
we need to talk .
the lawyer didn' t work out .
we got into a fight .
she won' t defend her ?
she' d rather prosecute her .
how' d you meet her ?
she was mom' s lawyer .
i' m not surprised your mother is sick .
they split up before i was born .
after my birth , she went crazy ... and was placed in a mental institution .
my grandparents raised me .
they wouldn' t let ivan see me .
you can look now .
mom was released a year ago .
when she got out , she wanted to go back to ivan ... but he was with you .
can you zip me up ?
so she sued him for millions ... for all the time she' d been locked up .
paulina was her lawyer .
your mother doesn' t mess around .
paulina tried to sue ivan , but it didn' t work .
what an insane story .
mom hates me .
i represent all her years without ivan .
well , i love you .
you' re the only good thing ivan ever did .
oh , it' s you .
i didn' t want to interrupt .
why so dressed up ?
i' m going out .
don' t mention the lawyer .
what ?
see if you can wake up marisa .
and if not ?
it' s up to you .
anyway , we' re leaving .
what ?
on a trip .
where ?
it' s a secret .
we' re fugitives .
it' s better if you don' t know .
but he knows everything .
come on .
what if ivan calls ?
tell him i expect nothing from him .
all i have left from him is the suitcase ... and i' m getting rid of it now .
no .
don' t say anything .
don' t get the phone ... or the door .
fine .
i' il be right back .
i overheard about your mom , and i' m really sorry .
you' re a kissing fanatic !
let' s give her some coffee .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
she' s having fun .
i' ve never seen her like this .
don' t wake her .
she' s having a great time .
see her face ?
she' s having a ball .
her face !
look at her lip !
hi .
i' ve come for my bag .
pepa said it was here .
that' s strange .
a kid brought it down earlier ... but when pepa saw it , she threw a fit .
so where' s the bag ?
she took it and she said ...
if he wants it , let him come and get it ... and show his face !
that' s what she said .
she' s upstairs now .
i' m in a hurry .
she' s probably calmed down ... but you never know .
i' il be back tomorrow .
don' t tell her i was here .
sir , i' m a jehovah' s witness and cannot tell lies .
only the truth , and nothing but the truth .
but if she doesn' t ask
if she asks , i have to tell the gospel truth .
good bye .
i' d like to lie !
the bad thing about my religion is ... that we can' t .
i love the sound of the trumpets on judgment day
ivan , i have to speak to you immediately .
leave a message and tell me when and where .
i can' t pick up my bag .
i wanted to talk to you ... but i see you' re avoiding me .
i' il try again in a few days ... when you' re a bit calmer .
i want you to know that our years together ... were the best of my life .
i' m not going away with any woman .
good bye , sweetheart .
i wish you the best with all my heart .
i' m so unhappy
because you no longer love me
why should i try to change your mind
be happy , my love
for i' il never forget the love you gave me
i' m so unhappy
look at him !
he' s nuts !
i' il show her , all right !
pepa , you' il pay dearly for those three shiites !
i' m not going away with any women .
good bye , sweetheart .
i wish you the best
liar !
maybe it' s true .
he can fool me with everything but his voice .
i know all his intonations .
i worked long enough with him .
goddamn phone !
what were you doing ?
that damn fucking bitch !
what did you see in her ?
let' s get your luggage .
you did it again .
forget it .
calm down !
just look at this place .
the cops !
take it easy .
come on .
it' s ivan .
i knew he' s no coward .
it' s your mother .
let' s play .
i can' t !
should i let her in ?
yes .
read the instructions !
" strategy is
not out loud !
what are you doing here , traitor ?
well  carlos , who is it ?
i don' t know .
it' s the police .
what do they want ?
we understood .
come on .
right .
shut up or i' il smack you .
good evening .
is she with you ?
we met in the elevator .
what' s going on ?
nothing .
just discussing the lady' s dress .
it' s awful .
it' s just a dress .
but it' s awful .
maybe she likes it .
stop acting like a kid in front of the policemen !
i love you , need you , want you .
your ivan .
may i ask why you' re here ?
a call was made from your telephone ... about some terrorists .
pardon ?
someone called from here about the shiite terrorists .
see !
i told you !
those kids !
there' s been some mistake .
my phone' s been out of order all day .
she just now pulled it out .
i called her 20 minutes ago .
ignore her .
she' s a bit crazy .
what am i charged with ?
nothing .
we just wanted information about who called .
who ripped out the phone ?
i did .
this morning .
so nobody' s called from here today .
pepa' s some talker !
why ?
i was expecting a call .
they didn' t call , and i got upset .
who ?
ivan ?
where is he ?
shut up .
i' il ask the questions .
well ... we will .
go ahead .
ask her who ivan is .
who' s ivan ?
the cause of this mess ... and of the mess your partner' s about to see .
he' s going to find marisa .
all right .
explain .
may i sit down ?
if i' m to bare my soul , i' d rather be comfortable .
i' ve had a hard day .
are you comfortable ?
i' d be more comfortable alone with my friends ... playing strategy .
you can' t always have everything .
we agree on that .
who is this ivan ?
he was my lover .
before that he was with her .
he' s my son' s father .
him ?
what' s he doing here ?
he came to rent my apartment .
i didn' t know .
i get the feeling you' re pulling my leg .
you think i like baring my soul to strangers ?
well , you' re wrong .
it' s humiliating .
damn it , mom !
candela , get me a drink .
what kind ?
there' s gazpacho .
right !
gazpacho !
let' s go .
where are you going ?
for gazpacho .
want some ?
we' re on duty , but we don' t want to be rude
gazpacho for everyone .
is she sleeping ?
like a log .
she' s carlos ' fiance .
she was tired .
you want me to wake her up ?
not yet .
why don' t you sit down ?
i' m getting a stiff neck .
we have nothing against you
thanks a lot .
without being inquisitive ... you must admit this is a little weird .
a charred bedroom ... a broken phone , a smashed window
it' s been weird , all right .
okay .
start at the beginning .
and make it clear , concise , and fair .
i don' t know if i can .
i' m too hurt to be clear , concise , and fair .
words !
just the facts .
okay .
i lived here ... with ivan .
we loved each other .
at least , i loved him .
after months of trying to keep our love together ... we split up a week ago .
he told me to pack his bags .
he' d be taking a trip ... with another woman .
he said that ?
he never travels alone .
remember , these two for the cops .
an extra dose .
careful .
this is too warm .
carlos , my god !
in front of your mother , the cops , your fiance !
aren' t you afraid ?
go on , please .
so i packed up his stuff and went to work .
when i came back , the house was like this .
except for the phone , which i did .
the suitcase was gone ... and the bed was all burned .
they' re taking very long .
go .
check .
they' re probably kissing .
what about marisa ?
she' d better wake up .
takes after his father .
now , who' s that ?
yeah ?
telephone repair .
and you ?
police .
your i. d. ?
and yours ?
are you the lady who called this morning ?
yes .
here' s the phone , and here' s the plug .
i reached her here by phone 20 minutes ago .
there she goes again !
not on this phone .
let' s get to the point .
do you know any shiite terrorists ?
shut up !
he' s asking her !
i didn' t know madrid had any .
do you know them ?
not me .
i' m not into politics .
sure , man .
they were on tv today !
shut up !
you want the tv on ?
i' m not interested in shiites .
ma' am , what about you ?
pepa and i have important things to discuss .
men , right ?
what' s more important ?
fine .
we' il talk about men .
is ivan involved with these terrorists ?
relax .
ivan ?
i don' t know .
he' s hidden so many things from me .
can you give me his address ... or phone number ?
he has no phone .
and he' s not home .
i told you he' s leaving town .
try the airport .
the airport ?
where' s he going ?
where is he going ?
to stockholm ... tonight .
with paulina morales .
stockholm !
why didn' t you say so before ?
because i just figured it out .
now i understand it all
the phone call .
what an idiot i am !
why didn' t i see it before ?
your lawyer played it beautifully .
you didn' t know they' d be hijacking that flight ?
the shiites ?
the whole country knows .
it was on tv .
but the tip came from this phone .
i want to know who the hell called ... or i' il haul you all in !
why aren' t you at the airport ?
there are more cops there than passengers .
i don' t know what' s going on ... but if you don' t start talking
chief , this stuff has been spiked .
what' s in the gazpacho ?
tomatoes , cucumbers ... bell pepper , onion ... one garlic clove ... oil , salt , vinegar ... some day old bread , and water .
the secret' s in mixing it right .
ivan loves the way i mix it .
i made it for him .
you collect weapons ?
get back !
move back .
i don' t want to hurt the kids .
is ivan really going to stockholm ?
it' s just a hunch , but i' m pretty sure .
what did you have to tell him ?
nothing , now .
i just want to forget him .
and you should do the same .
in the hospital , i had forgotten him .
i didn' t remember anything .
until suddenly ... one night , i heard his voice on tv .
i didn' t recognize his face ... just his voice .
he was telling a woman he loved her .
i felt a spasm inside me .
i remembered all the times he' s said that to me .
i regained my sanity and my memory .
from that moment on ...
i acted as if i had been cured ... and they released me .
if you' re cured , stop aiming at me .
but i' m not cured .
i faked it , and i fooled them .
i can only forget him by killing him .
how will you do that ?
at the airport .
the airport is full of cops .
you heard him .
i' il manage .
now that you know
let' s drink a toast .
drink !
you too .
oh , my eyes !
my eyes !
she left the door open !
the door !
take me to the airport , please .
sorry .
i have a date .
take me !
what the hell is that ?
a gun .
let' s go .
my girlfriend will be mad .
not as mad as i' il be .
quick , to stockholm !
right under my nose !
did you see that ?
come on .
after them !
you again !
great !
we' re meant for each other !
whom do we follow today ?
that motorcycle !
that harley !
i' il do my best .
to the airport !
blow on my eyes .
that lady is crazy , and she carries two guns .
why did she take ambite ?
because she' s in a hurry .
ah !
eye drops !
anything else , ladies ?
no .
just step on it .
that lady is dangerous .
no lady' s dangerous if you know how to handle her .
there they are .
i' ve got them .
i can' t see .
he can never say " no .
ana , that lady has two guns , and she' s a nut .
look what she did to me !
you think i go around like this for fun ?
she' s capable of anything !
my ass is the only one allowed on that bike .
i' m fed up .
i' m gonna get myself some quick cash ... buy myself his bike and split .
with a bike ... who needs a man ?
learning mechanics is easier than learning male psychology .
you can figure out a bike ... but you can never figure out a man .
she' s going for his balls !
i think she' s just trying to hang on .
fresh out of the mental ward ... and she looks like a professional biker .
be careful !
she' s crazy !
and she has a gun !
bitch !
get down !
shut up , idiot women !
leave my man alone !
can' t you go any faster ?
lady , this thing is a relic .
a relic ?
just remember this gun !
okay !
don' t shoot !
don' t you sell guns ?
i don' t need them .
what if you' re held up ?
i avoid danger , just like now .
sorry , ladies .
the chase is over .
please , just take us to the airport somehow .
i' m a taxi driver , not a bounty hunter .
i warned you she was a dangerous woman .
he said he could deal .
right here .
thanks .
stockholm , please ?
international flights are over there .
you' re weak , ivan .
yes , sweetheart .
don' t agree with me !
but you' re right .
sometimes i like to be wrong .
take me back to the hospital .
that' s my home .
are you all right ?
let go .
you saved my life , darling .
don' t worry .
i don' t want anything in return .
just one thing .
tell her to go away !
go away !
pepa , i' m ashamed .
i' ve treated you so badly .
all i wanted was to talk to you .
i' ve spent two days waiting ...
looking for you , leaving messages .
we can talk tonight .
the trip to stockholm can wait .
no .
it' s too late now .
don' t hold a grudge .
let' s have a drink , now , in the cafeteria .
yesterday ... this morning , or even at noon today ... we could have .
but now it' s too late .
it' s been too late for the past two hours .
then why did you come out here ?
lucia wanted to kill you ... and i came to stop her .
since you' re out of danger , i' m leaving .
good bye .
home at last !
the visitors ... are comfortable .
and the kids ?
candela really manages to recover quickly .
hope he' s luckier for her than the shiites were .
god , what a mess !
the maid comes tomorrow .
better wear shoes with this mess .
i wonder which is better ... slipping on gazpacho , or cutting myself on the glass .
the repairman is a doll , but i' d better save him for marisa .
i fell asleep .
how do you feel ?
like new .
but you don' t look so hot .
well ...
i' m going to have a baby .
i didn' t know .
you' re the first person i' ve told .
congratulations !
you should sit here .
i' il explain tomorrow .
but  sit down .
you just woke up , but i haven' t slept in two days .
i won' t sublet it .
i love the view .
yeah , it' s gorgeous .
how long was i asleep ?
hours !
you have beautiful skin .
i had a dream .
a good one ?
i think so .
i was a virgin this morning ... but i don' t think i am now .
don' t tell me one of these jerks  no .
it was in my dream !
great !
actually , you' ve lost ... that hard look that virgins have .
virgins are awful .
if you were on stage faking a cheap pain
don' t bother to act
i know that play
liar
how well you fit that part
it would seem after all
that' s the way you are
i was blinded
by your passionate kisses
you lied coldly
but the curtain finally came down
playacting
that' s what you do best
a finely rehearsed lie
a well turned mockery
you outdid yourself
destroying my heart
and now that your tears are for real
i only remember your lies
forgive me if i don' t believe you
but i think you' re putting on a show
don' t forget that after all
i' m supposed to be in the wrong
playacting
that' s what you do best
a finely rehearsed lie
a well turned mockery
you outdid yourself
destroying my heart
