who would have the power to puii something iike that off ?
johnnie cochran .
the justice department , the da' s office , the fbl .
u. s. marshal .
that' s carter .
i never gave rings to a guy before .
the rings are secure , sir .
and we can all breathe a little easier .
well done , angels .
thanks , charlie .
halo is safe , thanks to you .
it' s been a pleasure .
i hope to work with you iadies again .
but not too soon .
good iuck with everything .
your keys .
what is it ?
my ribs .
these aren' t mine .
that was a nice reach for a guy with a couple of fractured ribs .
good going , bos .
we got him .
we got who ?
of course , he already had one ring .
he just needed the other .
he wanted to fake his own death so he wouldn' t be a suspect .
who you aii talking about ?
he needed time for his plan , so he set up seamus .
then turned him ioose on dylan .
i think you' re onto something , angels .
damn !
so carter' s the bad guy !
it' s just speculation at this point , bosley .
we need proof .
keys , bosley .
let' s hit it .
punk .

keily garrett .
heilo , dylan .
don' t you have a case to solve ?
weil , i tried to outrun my past , but it caught up with me yesterday .
and i put my friends in danger .
they' re in more danger now without you .
natalie and alex are gonna replace me with someone great .
a reai angel .
not someone who' s pretending to be something she' s not .
your past is what makes you who you are , dylan .
don' t forget that charlie chose you for a reason .
angels are iike diamonds .
they can' t be made .
you have to find them .
each one is unique .
sometimes we search too hard for answers that are right in front of us .
the buyers are set .
we did it , partner !
you know , i never reaily got that partner thing .
heilo , angels .
madison lee .
why ?
why be an angei when i can play god ?
looks iike one of the three amigos has gone adis .
welcome back , dylan .
you' re such a typicai rebeilious pisces .
always out to prove how tough you are ... ... and you couldn' t make it one day on your own , could you ?
someone reminded me that every angei is unique .
and i knew it was you .
who else had contacts in mongolia ... ... could hack the halo fail safe and hire a surfer as an assassin ?
same astrologicai phenom who would refer to a motocross rider ... ... with a iion on his helmet as " leo .
very weii done .
very impressive , reaily .
you' ve got it aii figured out .
and now i' m gonna reaily enjoy ... ... knocking those halos right off your heads .
but you' re an angel .
no .
you just don' t get it .
i don' t take orders from a speaker box anymore .
i work for myself .
weil , your boss sucks .
the angels ' ass kicking pose .
seeing the three of you iike that ... ... does give me this iittle twinge of nostalgia for the old days .
but back then , it was a iittle bit different .
you see , when i was an angel ... ... we used guns .
sorry , charlie .
hello , angels .
good evening , charlie .
i love the new office .
madison , is that you ?
where are the angels ?
i' m sure there' s three more where they came from .
madison , what have you done ?
we' re just having a iittle fun .
you shouldn' t worry yourself , charlie .
you' ve never had trouble ... ... finding someone to give their iife for you .
hurting the angels doesn' t prove you' re the best .
you know that .
do i ?
madison , you were never able to accept that this agency ... ... is about teamwork .
we' re a family .
we do
yeah , yeah , yeah , i know .
angels forever .
i' ve heard the sales pitch .
it was very seductive ... ... once .
madison , you deliberately went rogue on the desoto case ... ... and put your fellow angels in danger .
when we finally got you out of there ... ... you were wounded so badly , we thought we might lose you .
you did iose me .
you see , being an angei wasn' t fulfiiling my destiny .
it was keeping me from it .
your destiny is yet to be written .
do not do this , madison .
taking the lives of innocent people is not the answer .
there must be something in you that' s still good .
i was never good .
i was great .
damn .
what a bitch !
you guys , we have to outthink madison .
no matter what we do , she' s always two steps ahead of us .
she' s seiling the iist off tonight , 8 : 00 .
but where ?
nat , what else did carter say ?
okay .
take the stars beyond the galaxy .
it' s safe to say it' s on this planet .
take shore to hope and stop on a stair .
there' s a hope street downtown .
but no shore for miles .
a stair .
astaire !
