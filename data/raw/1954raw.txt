a man who come to the farm and kept chasing after me
because you' re beautiful , silly !

my pretty little fatso ...
one more , please
you are terrible !
always asking for credit , and now this !

this should hold you for a little while
that' s much better .
what about her ?
it looks like she' s not used to this ... poor thing !
what about you ?
no kiss ?
no way !
i rather pay !
that' s too bad , since her man ...
this woman is much smarter than you
forget it !
that' s just talk .
everybody knows that
lf he' s really getting married , poor thing !
it' s time now .
they are arriving
take anything you want !
ls everybody crazy ?
you' re not going to see him ?
who ?
she doesn' t know him yet .
when she does , she' il run even faster than the others .
are you taking that ?
no way , that' s green !
green , green of course !

i' d love to make the sun rise
give him the guitar .
just to ckeck it out
this is a very old guitar ...
" orpheus is my master " .
yes , that' s true
there was an orpheus before me .
and one may come after i' m gone but i' m the one ruling now .
do you understand that ?
don' t be sad .
don' t tell anybody , ok ?
i will play a new song i just wrote
pretty , isn' t it ?
morning , such a pretty morning
a new song is born
singing of your eyes , your laughter , your hands
there will be a day when you come
from the strings of my guitar
that only your love sought
a voice comes and talks about kisses
kisses lost in your lips
sing , my heart , happiness is back
ln the dawn of this love
what are you doing here ?
i have the right to ...
zeca , take the guitar !
you didn' t see me !
lsn' t he here ?
who ?
was that you playing ?
orpheus taught me
where is he ?
he just left with a woman
what ?
since you have the guitar , play something
he' il hear me
that' s even better .
play
you again ?
what are you doing here ?
why didn' t you tell me that serafina is your cousin ?
so , we are close .
what' s your name ?
don' t you remember ?
i' m eurydice
wonderful !
i like you already !
of course !
orpheus likes eurydice , as the story goes
are you orpheus ?
yes , i am .
from head to toe .
but i ...
i don' t like you
yes , you do !
try to remember .
this is really an old story
thousands of years ago , orpheus was sad and melancholic
like the bird trapped in this cage
one day , from the strings of a guitar , sought by only one love , a voice spoke of lost kisses from the lips of eurydice
and eurydice' s lips were trembling with anxiety ... and the perfumed flower of her mouth opened slightly
no !
you are too young to remember
yes ...
i remember the words you sang ... because they are the same !
exactly !
but it was the melody i liked best
forgive me , eurydice
look
i need to talk to him
no , leave them alone !
orpheus , they' re waiting for you at the rehearsal !
yes !
well ...
i need to go
i know
i' il sing and dance for you !
are you coming ?
yes , i am
take good care of her !
let' s go !
see you later
thanks
why aren' t you paying any attention to me ?
i have no time now

and who is she ?

she is orpheus ' fiance
look , he' s going to kiss her
ok , that' s enough !
what' s so funny ?
nothing !
that' s enough !
why didn' t you kiss me ?
leave me alone .
have you tried on your costumes ?
of course !
mira' s costume is a beauty , isn' t it ?
it has embroidered sleeves .
let' s go see it
come and dance , eurydice , come
come on !
and who is that ?

my happiness is dreaming
ln the eyes of my girlfriend
lt' s like this night , passing
seeking the dawn speak low , please
so she might wake up happy
look ... it' s rising
offering a kiss of love
it' s true
sadness has no end
happiness does
happiness is like a drop of dew
on a flower' s petal
brilliant and tranquil , then quivering
then falling like a tear of love

it' s me .
hermes also came
i' ve nothing left in life
i am poorer than the poorest of the black men
seek mercy , my son .
we are all poor and ... what' s left to be said is the poor people' s word thanks
i ask you for mercy , hermes
all i can do is give you mercy
here .
i have already done everything that had to be done
i think that you' il get true mercy there
thank you , hermes
no , my son .
you are going to thank eurydice
yes
are you going to take her yourself ?
all right .
come with me
lf you don' t want it , it' s always interesting ... having another cadaver for the doctors , for science
and it is also cheaper for you
it is my duty to ask that question , because of them ... and , the truth is , when one is here ...
carnival is over , there is nothing one can do
would you like to try and identify her ?
careful , you' il get a cold dressed like that
death is cheap here , right ?
careful !
you' re shaking
the same thing happens to me
lt doesn' t help to be careful .
l have a cold all year round
everything is beautiful , eurydice
my heart is a bird whose thirst is quenched by a drop of dew
thank you , eurydice .
thank you for this new day
you are the one who carries me
i am in your arms , like a sleeping child
the sweet breath of your chest
i know you will take me where i must go
thank you , eurydice .
the path you chose is full of flowers
the sun is rising to embrace us , my love
you are singing , eurydice
the happiness of the poor is the great illusion of carnival
we work all year long
mira !

play a song for me , please
