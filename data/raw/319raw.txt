the water' s coming in faster than it' s going out .
i can' t believe we were stupid enough to sign on with that guy again .
maricon , ese got a gun on you , man .
i would' ve decked that son of a bitch .
he had us pullin ' 500 tons of lumber and steel , uninsured , in a typhoon , a hundred miles from any normal shipping lane .
and woods tells me foster got tossed out of the navy for striking a superior officer .
hey , hiko .
comin ' through .
i' il tell you one thing , stevie .
it' s the last time we make a move ...
for percentage of cargo instead of a salary .
damn straight .
damn straight .
i told you it was a bad idea .
my idea ?
it was your idea .
it was your idea .
what are you talking about ?
how is it ?
it' s bad .
define bad .
we' re sinking .
that' s bad .
so does anyone have any suggestions ?
mayday , mayday , mayday .

we' re gonna distribute
fifty mile range .
piece of junk .
hey , you buy this shit ?
wait , wait , wait !
i' m picking up a contact .
there might be another ship in the eye with us .
twelve miles out .
speed : zero knots .
it' s dead in the water , but it' s really big .
let' s hail it , foster .
ahoy , vessel , latitude 29 degrees south , longitude 1 7 9 degrees east .
this is the sea star .
we are 12 miles northwest of your position .
come back .
so where the hell is the captain ?
i' m busy .
skipper , there' s a ship in the eye with us .
dead in the water , about 12 miles out .
dead in the water ?
i' il be there in a minute .
dead in the water .
captain ?
dead ahead , 300 yards .
hail it , woods .
unidentified vessel , this is the sea star ... approaching from the northwest , 300 yards out .
dead ahead , 300 yards .
unidentified vessel , this is the sea star ... approaching from the northwest , 300 yards out .
please come back .
over .
you see anything ?
nope .
not a thing .
that ain' t ours , brother .
unidentified vessel , this is the sea star ... approaching from the northwest , 200 yards out .
come back .
over .
this is the sea star approaching from the northwest .
ls anybody there ?
over .
she looks russian .
the academic vladislav volkov , missile and satellite tracking ship .
45, 000 tons full gross , 642 feet , two steam turbines .
300 .
armament : none .
she' s fitted for scientific purposes .
their biggest .
forty two labs , five machine shops outfitted with advanced robotics .
three parabolic dishes can maintain simultaneous communication ... with several spacecraft .
ahoy , the vladislav volkov !
i' m the captain of the sea star .
ls there anyone aboard ?
ahoy !
baker .
break out the shotguns , the flashlights and the walkies .
we' re goin ' aboard .
shit .
jesus christ .
this is kind of stupid , stevie .
shh .
come on .
very stupid .
stevie .
this is very stupid , what we' re doing .
stevie .
stevie !
those are bullet holes , stevie .
shit , i don' t like this at all , man .
this is bullshit .
ahoy , the bridge !
anyone aboard ?
the bridge is deserted .
what the hell happened in here ?
what a mess .
looks like somebody powered it down , captain .
captain ?
captain , do you see anything ?
you' il be the first to know , woods .
what do you think ?
pirates ?
russian mafia , probably .
pipe down .
check the radio .
it' s smashed .
these logs are worthless , unless somebody reads russian .
that storm wall is 16 miles due east .
captain , you' ve got an hour and a half .
he' s , uh , thinking , foster .
you know , something you were paid to do ?
you thinking what i' m thinking ?
huh ?
what ?
salvage ?
salvage , baby .
you all signed on for a percentage .
but you never figured i' d bring you this , did you ?
a ship abandoned in international waters .
maritime law says she' s a derelict .
all we have to do is tow her to safety , slap a salvage lien on her , and the russian government has to pay us 10o/ o of her value to get her back .
richie , put a number on her for me .
well , let' s see .
there' s three parabolic satellite dishes .
one of them' s kind of fucked up .
forty two labs all primed with , uh , state of the art stuff .
let' s see .
we' re talking ... two hundred ?
three hundred million ? $300 million . $300 million !
ten percent of that is $30 million .
that' s what' s comin ' our way .
the opportunity of a lifetime if we play our cards right .
that' s what , about 30 grand apiece ?
three hundred g' s apiece .
three hundred g' s !
that' s at one percent ?
i' m willing to change all that , cut you in for ten percent .
that' s $3 million each .
what do you think of that ?
what do you think ?
ls it legal ?
totally .
totally legal .
shit .
i' m in if you' re in , jefe .
hey , i' m good .
what about you , foster ?
oh , foster , please !
come on !
what ?
come on !
it' s easy money !
there' s no such thing as easy money , squeaky .
i' il take that as a yes , foster .
baker , find the ship' s generator .
we need power to the bridge .
see if you can get the main engines running .
squeaky , you go with him .
richie ?
throw a line down to the tug .
we' re gonna have to turn this ship into the wind .
foster , can you see if you can get some of this navigational equipment started ?
captain .
my father was an admiral .
i know a little something about maritime law .
lf there' s anybody alive on this ship , you can' t claim her .
then let' s not find anyone alive .
what does that mean ?
just that .
i hope we don' t find anyone alive .
woods , come back to me .
we' re gonna need to turn the ship into the wind .
it just doesn' t add up .
you know ?
russian vessel , middle of nowhere , dead in the water , crew vanished ?
i mean , why would they abandon ship ?
i don' t know .
and another thing .
who the hell do you think we can trust here ?
we' re talkin ' about an awful lot of goddamn money , right ?
listen , the only two guys that we can trust is just you and me , stevie .
that' s it .
i wouldn' t take a check from the captain .
woods is wound up so tight , you couldn' t pull a pin out of his ass with a tractor .
and hiko is like
i don' t understand what the hell hiko is .
richie' s crazy like a fox , stevie .
but , you know , i think he just might be there for us .
and foster' s good .
good " ?
what do you mean by " good " ?
i mean she' s solid , on the level .
what' d you think i meant ?
sounds like you think she' s hot .
course i think she' s hot .
don' t you ?
right here , steve .
right here .
got it ?
yep .
yeah , that' s it .
aw , shit .
no go ?
nope .
what' s wrong with this thing ?
here' s your problem right here .
looks like somebody trashed the control panel .
oh , yeah .
these three relays are unplugged .
let' s hustle , squeak .
we got no power to the rudder in a typhoon ,
we' re screwed .
i' m hustling , all right ?
okay .

that' s more like it .
captain ?

good job , baker .
you lit us up like a pinball machine !
tell you something .
we' re gonna be rich .
you' re gonna be a rich man , hiko !
captain ?
somebody' s running this .
looks like it' s running itself .
computers don' t run themselves .
i don' t know much about computers , but that' s an anchor .
emergency on top deck !
emergency on top deck !
anchor went down on the tug !
baker , did you copy that ?
we need you up here oh , jesus .

i' m doin ' fine .
this whole thing is automated .
it runs by itself .
negative , negative .
we got somebody else on board .

we got somebody else on board .
that' s who sank the tug .
now , i want you to bolt the engine room door shut .
you understand me ?
i copy that .
and hurry up , will you ?
listen , i think we should split up into two groups .
root ' em out .
i agree .
i just have to fix his leg .

three hundred crew members are gone ?
what happened ?
eight days ago , during a transmission from the mlr space station , something came onto the ship .
we thought our transmitters and receivers were malfunctioning , so we shut them down .
it took control of computers , scanned all information .
language , encyclopedias , medical data .
it was learning .
learning what ?
how to kill us .
my captain , alexi , and me were the last to survive .
we cut their cables , smashed them

squeaky ?

it' s us !
where the hell have you two been ?
back from your holiday ?
jesus christ .
woods , you' re a mess .
thank you .
you said a russian did this ?
no , a machine did that with a nail gun .
yeah , that' s right .
you' re not gonna believe it till you see it .
there' s some really weird shit goin ' down on this ship , man .
weird ain' t the word .
i' m in need of some proper medical attention .
shut the fuck up !
i don' t belong on this ship .
somebody just welded the engine room door shut .
it' s welded ?
squeaky' s still missing .
weird .
r richie ?
richie , it' s that smell again .
squeak ?
hey , squeaky !
squeak , man .
ls that you ?
shit !
go !
that bastard shot at us !
you' re all going to die .
you hear that , foster ?
we' re all going to die , because there are aliens on this ship .
that' s all the grounds i need .
one of my men is missing .
and i want some answers !
and no more of this twilight zone stuff .
i don' t know anything about your man .
rubbish .
i' m gonna give you five seconds , and then i' m gonna blow your brains out .
one  she couldn' t possibly know where squeaky is .
she was hiding in sick bay .
she knows .
she dropped an anchor on my tug .
she fired at us .
two .
captain !
hiko , come on !
that anchor nearly killed me .
i' m not feeling too sympathetic .
me neither .
three .
shoot me .
i don' t care .
just shut down the power to the ship .
captain , she' s not gonna tell you what you wanna hear .
hey , captain .
i' d like to hear what she has to say about this .
up here on the chart table , richie .
fake bastard !
what the bloody hell is that ?
it beats the hell out of us .
it' s alexi , my captain .
hell , whatever it is , it tried to kill us .
squeaky' s still awol , and somebody welded the engine room door shut .
we' re not alone here .
she' s got another friend down there .
can someone explain what the hell is goin ' on ?
finish your story , nadia .
the energy that came from the mlr ... infested all of the ship' s electrical systems .
mainframe computer , the labs , the machine shops .
it activated fire extinguishers .
sixty seven died from halon gas poisoning .
quarter of the crew .
it cut us off from machine shops and started building .
the little ones first the gatherers .
yeah .
we saw a whole room full of them .
that' s what nailed woods .
then came something ... more dangerous .
half man , half machine .
a biomechanism .
engineering beyond our comprehensions .
the rest of the crew deserted , taking their chances in the sea .
only alexi and me stayed , cutting cables .
what does cutting cables have to do with it ?
the machines are controlled by the electrical energy in the computer .
lf we can cut their source of power , they' il die .
we cut these to get him here .
what the hell are you talking about ?
what is this thing that' s inside the computer , huh ?
it' s a life form unlike anything we know .
not cellular but electrical in nature .
extremely intelligent .
you mean it' s like lightning that can think .
it has no form , no shape , but it' s giving itself what it lacks .
it' s creating a new life form ... using parts of the ship and crew .
blood is still pumping through this brain .
there' s been no decomposition at all .
yeah .
here , right here .
see ?
there' s ... some kind of coil or self contained power supply built right into it .
amazing .
this brain is still alive .
hello ?
stop fucking around with the damn thing , richie !
i' m just looking at it , steve .
alexi ?
touch it again , i' il cut your hands off .
i can respect that .
it' s still alexi .
it' s alexi .
rubbish !
you' re listening to a pile of russian rubbish .
and i for one won' t listen to any more of it .
there' s no alien .
something their government cooked up .
it all went wrong , didn' t it ?
you' re afraid the rest of the world' s gonna find out about it .
dr. lgor fuckin ' frankenstein there .
alexi was no medical experiment .
he was my husband .
rubbish .
could someone please come and take a look at the nails in my shoulder ?
woods , stop whining !
ow !
god !
ow !
oh , my god .
captain !
brace yourselves !
we gotta turn her into the wind !
the steering doesn' t answer .
we could steer the ship from the engine room .
i thought you said the door was welded .
we' il cut the damn door .
right .
bring her .
i wanna keep her in my sight .
i gotta get off this ship .
all clear ?
clear .
did you feel that ?
the ship' s turning .
we just turned 20 degrees into the wind .
the ship' s steering itself .
ships don' t steer themselves .
she' s altered her course .
let' s go .
come on .
engine room' s one deck down .
what the hell was that ?
could be squeak .
i don' t care who it is !
i said it could be squeak !
steve .
jesus christ .
careful , richie .
yeah .
it' s too weird , man .
you can' t open that door .
what is it , steve ?
i don' t know .
what you got , richie ?
i don' t know .
it could be squeaky .
let me see .
let me see !
what the hell is that ?

where are we ?
communications room .

i' m callin ' for help .
did you trash this ?
we destroyed every transmitter on the ship .
you didn' t smash this one .
mayday , mayday , mayday !
don' t !
what the hell is wrong with you ?
are you out of your fuckin ' mind ?
no one else is gonna claim salvage on this vessel but us .
you' re no longer in charge .
come here !
what do they want from us ?
it wants to kill us .
no , they want something .
it wants to mutilate us just like it did woods .
did you see squeaky ?
that thing wants something from us .
why don' t we talk to it ?
it' s in the computer .
we could talk to it .
what ?
talk to it !
it' s in the computer .
what the hell ?
what do i do ?
what do i do ?
nadia , please help me .
i need english , please .
