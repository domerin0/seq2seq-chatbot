you probably already thought about putting a sign up on the roof cos there' s still planes in the air .

we can get paint from case hardware .
use doors to board up the weak spots .
that' s a solid plan .
cj , is it ?

it' s the first place i went .
some dipshit on the radio said it was safe .
he was wrong .
that' s where you got them ?
i got a call on the cb from glen saying these folks were in the chapel .
he' s a priest ?
no , he plays the organ .
i was in the neighborhood so i picked them up .

i' il take my chances .
don' t be an idiot .

the people here could use your help .
fuck y' all .
it' s nice to see you' ve all bonded through this disaster .
hey .
you need anything ?
no , we' re fine .
he' s got a bite on his hand .
she' s cold .
that' s good , right ?
i don' t know .
it' s weird .
an infection this bad usually comes with a fever .
that guy' s arm looks pretty bad .
you should check it out .
all right .
stay with her for a minute .
let me take a look at that .
i' m fine , really .
they don' t hurt much .
tucker could use you more than me .
his ankle' s cut pretty bad .
i' il just clean it up a bit .
you ok ?
ma' am , can i get you something ?
like a glass of water ?
anal ana , come here !
anyone know her name ?
died without a name ?
damn .
you wanna use the other room ?
holy shit !
holy shit .
holy shit .
i think it' s the bites .
frank said she was walking on her own five hours ago .
the bites killed her .
the bites brought her back .
how do you know ?
i watched it happen .
i felt her pulse , she was gone .
then ... yesterday i saw the same thing .
i think that' s why it spread so fast .
all right .
so who else in the group is bitten ?
frank for sure .
and the one with the foot ?
tucker ?
he says no , he fell .
so it' s frank .
tall guy , right ?
right .
so we have to quarantine him .
where do we do that ?
there must be a place in here .
then what ?
i don' t know .
but ... it' s too dangerous to keep him here .
what are we talking about ?
are we talking about killing him ?
you' d rather wait for him to die and then he kills us ?
yes .
no .
you can' t kill him .
he' s got a daughter ! i' m sorry .
there' s no other choice .
he' s right .
michael , no .
what if i' m wrong ?
you' ve seen it happen before .
frank .
michael' s coming to shoot you .
what ?
you' re infected .
you' re going to become one of them .
is this true ?
are you here to kill me ?
you were bitten .
it' s only a matter of time .
no .
no .
no .
leave my dad alone .
go away .
you can' t do this .
you have to understand that she' s lost everyone .
her mother , her two brothers .
i' m all she' s got .
well , michael , what are you waiting for ?
go ahead .
kill him .
hey , kill tucker , too .
wait a minute .
i was never bit .
we can' t be sure .

are you sure it' s the bite ?
no .
she' s sure .
i' m sorry .
hey .
hi .
are you ok ?
mm .
let me see your arm .
it hurts .
it' s already starting to heal .
andre , i can' t have baby here .

i felt it .
we gotta come up with a name .
i want russian name .
don' t start that .

terry ?
yeah .
hold this .
oh , god .
somebody should say something .
yeah .
glen ?
no .
you worked in the church .
i played the organ .
you must have heard the priest say something about life and death .
it was a job .
i don' t believe in god .
i don' t see how anyone could .
somebody should say something .
there' s nothing to say .
i' ve been to a lot of funerals .
i' ve folded the flag and given it to a lot of wives and fathers and kids and told them how sorry i was .
but that' s not what i was really feeling .
in the back of my mind , i was always saying , " better them than me .
but i don' t believe that now .
now i realize there are some things worse than death and one of them is sitting here waiting to die .
i don' t want to die here .
i saw a couple of buses in the garage .
we could reinforce them , then get as far from here as possible .
and then what ?
i have an idea .
um ... why don' t we swing by the marina and hop in my boat and take it for a pleasure cruise , you jackasses .
wait .
there' s islands in the lakes , there' s not a lot of people on them .
i was kidding .
how far is the marina ?
oh , my god !
you' re serious ?
i think it' s a damn good idea .
how about the rest of you ?
kenneth ?
yeah , it' s a good idea .
we have to pick up andy .
he' s part of the group .
excuse me .
not to shit on anyone' s riff but let me see if i grasp this concept .
you' re saying we take the parking shuttles , reinforce them with aluminum siding and then head to the gun store where our friend andy plays some cowboy movie , jump on the wagon bullshit .
then we drive across a ruined city through thousands of dead cannibals , all so we can sail off into the sunset on this fucking asshole' s boat ?
and head for some island which may not even exist ?
yeah .
pretty much , yeah .
yeah .
ok .
i' m in .
we have 12 of these shotgun shells , 26 of those pussy .
9 mils , and 16 of the .
357 magnums .
yeah ?
that' s still not very much , so hopefully there won' t be too many of them at the dock .
nice to see you busting your ass .
oh , that' s sarcasm .
that is awesome .
you know , i would love to help but , er , a captain never works alongside his men .
you guys have a good ' un .
what a total dick .
guys , where did chips go ?
chips ?
i can' t find him .
chips ?
come on , chips !
" come on , chips ! " where' d you go , honey ?

come in here first .
i want you to see this .
when those things are on the side of the bus , this' il get them off .
cool , huh ?
wow .
that might be the most romantic thing anyone' s ever shown me .
i' m trying here .

it' s not just about him starving .
if we pick him up and he doesn' t have his strength , we' il be carrying him .
she' s right .
he' s a hell of a shot .
we need him .
i' m not saying we don' t .
there' s no point in arguing .
we need to get some food over there .
i know .
we draw straws and the loser runs across the lot with a ham sandwich .
could you be a bigger prick ?
yes , but that' s irrelevant .
my question is , what' s your plan ?
come on !

i have an idea .
it' s hurting him ! it' s not safe ! they' re not interested in him .
