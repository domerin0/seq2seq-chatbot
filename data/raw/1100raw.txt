really ?
same with you ?
wow .
well , in my business , it' s not a good thing .
what do you do ?
what do i do ?
i want to show you something .
i hold on to this .
a paper clip ?
was that a paper clip ?
it was .
i had to find something ... ... to draw the nervous energy away from my heart .
like a ....
like a lightning rod ?
like a lightning rod .
exactly .
all the energy goes into the paper clip .
and then what' s left is ....
your speech .
yeah , a smooth , and i' d like to think ... ... very compelling speech .
some of the best speakers in history ... ... a paper clip .
let me see , henry kissinger .
he wasn' t known for his speaking abilities .
no , he wasn' t , was he ?
he would' ve really sucked .
he would' ve what ?
really sucked .
right .
so maybe you' il try again ?
hey , ma , can we go see the penguins ?
let' s go see penguins .
five minutes .
you' re a bad influence .
i am ?
hurry up !
look at this guy go .
they' re so funny .
they look like little , fat , short guys with tuxedos .
speaking of fat guys in tuxedos , there' s this thing monday night .
it' s a black tie .
it' s a $2500 a plate dinner .
oh , my god . $2500 per plate ? $2500 a plate .
i hope you get to keep the plate .
you can if you want .
what is it for ?
for the inner city literacy campaign , something i support .
it' s a big benefit that maddox throws every year .
it' s not quite as boring as it sounds .
i don' t know , are you interested ?
wait a minute . lsn' t that the guy who hired yatter to get pictures of you ?
yes , it is .
i don' t get it .
why would you go ?
i go because i go it' s exposure .
won' t everyone know you' re there just to expose yourself ?
well , i kind of have to expose myself .
when you put it that way  i didn' t .
you put it that way .
i don' t care how much you pay for dinner .
you shouldn' t serve yourself up , no matter what the cause .
so why don' t you tell me what you really think .
you really want me to tell you what i think ?
lf mr. wanton maddox , or whatever his name is , really wants to help ... ... why doesn' t he give the $2500 per plate to the inner city schools ?
and eat a little bit lighter that night , you know ?
so why don' t you come with me and tell him yourself .
monday ... ... l' m busy .
sorry .
you' re busy , you can' t ?
what ?
can you change it ?
it' s complicated .
which reminds me , i gotta get out of here .
come on , we gotta go .
we gotta go .
we' re gonna be late .
do we have to ?
i gotta get back .
caroline .
this can' t be it .
come on , we haven' t seen the snakes .
except for yatter .
it was nice meeting you , chris marshall .
we' re late .
we gotta go .
come on .
here , ty ....
don' t use them all on one speech .
i won' t .
keep up the good voting record .
i' il do my best .
it' s complicated .
what kind of answer is that ?
honest .
the only thing complicated between me and him would be my bra strap .
look , what am i supposed to do ?
make his bed with me in it ?
get real !
he thinks i' m a guest here .
all right .
all right .
but just tell me what he was like .
sexy eyes .
and nice lips .
what about the hands ?
were they big ?
they were perfect .
perfect works .
marisa !
who ?
what ?
marisa ventura , are you back there ?
oh , my god , it' s paula !
what are you doing ?
i just ....
i spilled something on my apron ... ... so i was cleaning it , and she was helping me tie it .
mr. bextrum wants to see you in his office right now .
oh , shit !
look who' s here .
let' s review the last hour , okay ?
delgado killed while you were out walking that goddamn dog .
you got a pen that works ?
sure .
here you go .
anything else i can do for you ?
no , that' s good , thanks .
get this note to the woman in the park suite .
her name is caroline .
can you handle that for me ?
certainly .
thank you .
who' s caroline in the park suite ?
someone i met .
you wanted me to have an escort ... ... for that maddox literacy thing on monday night .
but i was thinking more of a blind , ex illiterate senior citizen who learned ...
... to read while fighting nazis .
i thought your mother was in florida .
just make sure she' s not married , on medication ... ... or a democrat .
did you check , or ?
rufus .
sure , okay , great .
can i talk to you for a second ?
i want you to find out who caroline is in the park suite .
don' t write it down .
just remember it .
thanks .
good job .
come in , miss ventura .
i assume you know the reason you' ve been called here .
i think so .
yes , sir .
do you know what the foundation of a great hotel is ?
location ?
loyalty and trust .
would you say those are qualities that you possess ?
i would .
yes , sir .
miss burns agrees .
and she' s urged me to consider you .
we had no idea you were interested in management ... ... until miss kehoe brought us your application .
by the way , you forgot your social security number ... ... and your mother' s maiden name .
lf you just fill them in and sign right there .
perfect .
normally , you' d go through the program and train for a year as a butler , but
given the circumstances  due to overbooking and understaffing ... ... we decided to accelerate your application .
and move you into management after the six week training .
with the proviso that you pass the practical exam ... ... and fulfill each requirement for every station .
so you see , miss ventura , sometimes ... ... when life shuts one door , it opens a window .
so jump .
steph , where are you ?
i know you' re in here .
don' t tell me you' re busted .
no , you are .
you know what ?
you had no right !
what are you talking about ?
you filled out an application for me ?
they' re considering you .
do you know what you' ve done ?
i did you a favor .
no . lf you wanna do me a favor ... ... then mind your own business once in a while .
for two years , you' ve yapped about getting out of uniform ... ... and what ideas you got .
this morning , i' m having coffee with rosalie from personnel ... ... and i ask her .
i go , " marisa got a shot ?
she goes , " marisa who ?
i go , " marisa ventura .
she' s applied .
she goes , " lf she applied , i' d slip it to the top of the pile .
so i just act real nonchalantlike and i go , " are you sure ?
marisa ventura ain' t never applied for no management program ever .
lmagine my shock and dismay .
my own partner , lying to me like that .
then i figured maybe you were too chickenshit , so i did it myself .
lf they took you , you' d be happy .
and if they didn' t , you wouldn' t know the difference .
so sue me !
these are the golden years .
we gotta prove our mothers wrong .
don' t waste them .
what we did today was wrong .
but you didn' t really lie .
not technically .
now you' re starting to sound like nixon .
letting someone believe something' s true when it' s not ... ... is just as much a lie as a lie is .
i let him think i was staying in the suite , not cleaning it .
i' m the maid .
i hate to break it to you , but i don' t think he' s after your money .
i can' t believe you just said that !
just get my keys in my pocket , please .
this is hot .
good job .
all right , sweetie .
behave yourself , okay ?
thank you .
my pleasure .
can i borrow this ?
of course .
thank you .
baby , bye .
and remember , all security lds ... ... will need to be rephotographed starting next week .
i think that' s all .
thank you very much .
barbara , clarice , come with me , please .
have you seen this ?
no .
what ?
well , let me show you .
give me this .
yeah .
so ?
what do you mean , " so " ?
what if somebody from the hotel sees it ?
i hate to break the bubble .
you can' t tell it' s you .
don' t worry about it .
it' s the front page of the paper today .
stop .
you do one spontaneous thing , you think you' re going to hell .
do you understand this could be bad ?
don' t be such a catholic .
please .
come on .
good morning .
nice to see you .
can i steal him away for a second ?
sure .
let me steal you away .
excuse me .
i want to talk to you .
what' s the problem ?
this !
do you know what this is gonna cost me ?
an entire day of doing nothing but covering your ass .
i' m getting calls from the london times , the washington post ... ... the chicago sun , asking about her identity , her background ... ... who the kid is .
a kid !
just when i get them to focus on your assets , they' re focusing on hers .
thanks .
yeah , well , they' re fantastic assets , don' t you think ?
squeezing the circle tighter and tighter and tighter ... ... and release .
let' s try that again .
and squeeze the circle tighter , tighter ...
... and relax .
sorry , i' il come back .
that' s okay .
you can work around us .
we could use some more towels , por favor .
rapido .
squeezing the circle tighter ... ... and tighter and tighter .
radiating from the pelvis .
good .
breathe .
exhale .
are you all right ?
twinkles , is it eric ?
i knew it .
he hasn' t called once .
not my cell , not the service , not the hotel .
so last night i called him , and rach , he was with ....
i can' t .
it' s like cheap wine .
shall we do some band work , ladies ?
go on , i' m listening .
i heard her in the background .
the cheap wine ?
his ex , in midlaugh .
butler service , miss lane .
i have a message from mr. christopher marshall .
christopher marshall ?

ln my room ?
i have to charge the full hour .

thank you .
when did this go down ?
we met at this thing in southampton last summer .
i thought we had a moment .
can you steal away an hour , please ?
you think he saw you in the hall ?
who cares ?
what should i wear ?
you look good in anything .
but i didn' t bring a thing !
let' s see .
maria , thank goodness .
i need a favor .
it' s urgent .
could you get those outfits you returned for me yesterday ?
there' s this divine dolce cashmere coat .
it' s just
actually , they' re still in the closet .
i thought you might want a second look .
you are so good .
thank god !
you should be a personal assistant .
she' s a maid .
so are they , with better titles .
actually , i' m up for a position .
what do you think ?
dolce coat , gucci pants ... ... or ralph lauren skirt , manolo pumps ?
they' re both divine !
let' s see .
how about the pants , open sandals , see through blouse ... ... colored bra and carry the dolce coat for effect .
maria ?
she barely speaks english .
what ?
excuse me ?
maria , what do you think ?
what about the beaded skirt with that beige ... ... crocheted halter you have in the closet ?
you know , casual sexy .
no stockings .
definitely eighty six the coat .
it sends the wrong message .
like you' re going someplace .
besides , that whole see through blouse , colored bra thing ... ... reads a little desperate , older gal , trying too hard .
don' t you think ?
you want to make him work for it .
who does she think she is to talk to me like that ?
thank you , maria .
eric who ?
excuse me .
sorry .
yes , that' s it .
all handles parallel with the right elbow .

i called about a ticket to the  benefit .
monday night .
we were able to procure you a single at a table adjacent to mr. marshall' s .

lnteresting .
yeah , we think so .
shall we ?
okay ?
bye .
what are you not saying ?

maybe you should spend real time in the projects ... ... and then you wouldn' t have to make up speeches and memorize them .
you know , it would be coming from someplace real .
and how would you know ?

i lived in a four block radius my whole life .

you can still be a manager , right ?
yeah , if i break it off with chris .
break what off ?
no offense , sweetheart .

how will you prevent her from speaking ?
this would never happen at the four seasons .
i can assure you it has never happened here before either .
lionel , you are slipping .
you should' ve noticed something .
i am disappointed .
please , mr. bextrum , he had nothing to do with this .
of course , sir .
i understand .
we' il talk about this later .
miss ventura , you no longer work here .
go to security , hand in your passes ... ... and you' il be escorted from the building .
yes , sir .
ls that really necessary ?
chris , let the man do his job , okay ?
oh , chris .
oh , chris .
i can' t help but feel that this is partly my fault .
it isn' t .
spare yourself .
at least let me buy you lunch .
after all , we' ve only got each other to get through this humiliation .
caroline , the first lunch was a mistake .
a second would be complete torture .
drinks , then ?
i need your nametag , passkey and your ld card .
sorry , marisa , but i have to .
i understand .
god , don' t tell me they fired you over this too .
no .
actually , i made a decision a moment ago .
it was long overdue .
you quit ?
sometimes ... ... we' re forced in directions that we ought to have found for ourselves .
thank you .
thanks , keef .
bye .
to serve people ... ... takes dignity and intelligence .
but remember , they' re only people with money .
and although we serve them , we are not their servants .
what we do , miss ventura , does not define who we are .
what defines us is how well we rise after falling .
i think you' il make a wonderful manager someday .
and it' s been my great honor to have worked with you .
marisa ?
marisa !
caroline !
marisa !
i don' t know which name to use .
marisa .
i don' t get it .
what just happened ?
what don' t you get ?
i' m the maid .
what was all this , some kind of bet ?
a little game of what , get the guests ?
i was trying on her clothes , and you were there ... ... and you invited me out , and everything
and you thought you had to lie to keep me interested ?
who' s kidding who here ?
think you would' ve looked at me if you knew i was the maid ?
well ....
come on .
with respect for your big hearted politics ...
... l don' t think so , mr. assemblyman .
you didn' t give me a chance .
you stand on your soapbox , judging everyone , so sure they' re judging you .
and you think they' re not ?
come on .
half the time , i' m a stereotype they make fun of .
the other half of the time , i' m invisible .
maybe that' s the point .
the first time you saw me , i was cleaning your bathroom , only you didn' t see me .
was i supposed to introduce myself while taking a leak ?
you can' t nail me for that .
what are you doing ?
not now , jerry .
just
go .
you might as well sell tickets .
i don' t care .
you care .
no .
no .
no .
no .
marisa .
i just want the truth .
all right , you want the truth ?
there was a part of me that wanted to see what it felt like ... ... to have someone like you look at me the way you did , just once .
and i' m sorry .
truly .
lf i could rewind the past week , i would .
was any of it real ?
yeah , it was real .
it was so real it made me wonder how i was ever gonna give you up .
but i had to give you up .
that was the plan .
and then ....
last night ... ... l couldn' t .
rosalie from personnel called .
we expected you hours ago .
hi , baby .
she told me what happened .
hey , ma .
you okay ?
scoot over , let me see your homework .
i don' t know what to say .
what are we gonna do for dinner ?
you hungry , sweetie ?
will you look at me ?
no .
i' m gonna take a bath .
don' t , mom .
what were you thinking , going out with someone like that ?
someone like what ?
chris marshall .
you had to pretend to be somebody so he' d go out with you ?
where is your pride , marisa ?
people like you make people like him a god .
why , because he' s rich ?
white ?
he has things we don' t have ... ... that we don' t want to dream about ?
it must really burn you that i think i have the right to go out with him .
you don' t .
ty , go to your room and finish your homework , please .
what happened to you ?
don' t speak to me like that .
i am not the one who lost her job today .
no , i did .
i messed up .
okay ?
it' s all my fault .
you know what ?
it' s all right .
i' il be fine .
you will because we' il call seora rodriguez .
she owes me a favor .
she has  i' m not calling mrs. rodriguez .
i love you , okay ?
i do .
but i don' t want to clean houses .
there' s nowhere to go from there .
hasn' t this taught you anything ?
wake up , little girl , you have responsibilities .
and they come every month like clockwork .
you want to end up back in the projects ?
keep dreaming dreams that will never happen .
you want to put food on the table ?
call seora rodriguez .
you' re right , ma .
i' m a good cleaning lady .
i' il start over .
but not with mrs. rodriguez .
i' m gonna find a job as a maid in some hotel .
after some time passes , i' m gonna apply for the management program .
and when i get the chance to be a manager ....
and i will , ma .
i know i will .
i' m going to take that chance without any fear .
without your voice in my head telling me that i can' t .
did you see this ?
how did it start ?
did he know you were a maid ?
are you a beresford perk ?
how long were you involved ?
how did they find you out ?
any advice to other maids looking to trade up ?
did democrats put you up to this ?
does he tip well ?
ls it true you' re booked on larry king live ?
i' m at the beresford hotel , where yesterday ... ... senate hopeful chris marshall was captured on video in a lovers ' spat ... ... with a woman now identified as a hotel maid .
who' s kidding who here ?
think you would' ve looked at me if you knew i was the maid ?
with respect  oh , shit .
oh , my god .
we won' t we will not be answering
we will not be taking any questions right now .
mr. marshall will make a statement .
morning .
i' d like to make a short statement .
and it will be all that i have to say about this ....
this invasion of my privacy .
i happened to meet miss ventura and her son ... ... during my stay at a hotel in new york .
and we became friends .
there are people from all walks of life who i count as friends .
and my only regret in this instance is that one of them , miss ventura ... ... was subjected to the scrutiny and innuendo of the media ... ... as a result of that friendship with me .
i need these numbers to be plus 1 0 percent .
welcome to the employee cafeteria .
it' s open 2 4 hours a day ....
please .
ls today the 1 9th ?
six more shopping days .
he' s here .
he' s back !

it' s cold .
at your hotel .
ma !

i heard you , bubba !
don' t you think it' s weird ?
you' il be there , he' il be there .
so will a thousand other people .
we talked about this .
you have your turtleneck on backwards .
i thought we talked about this .
i know , but it' s like fate .
no , it' s like new york city and an available conference room .
you knew , didn' t you ?
you weren' t gonna tell me .
you knew he was coming .
remember , bubba , what i told you ?
we talked about this .
he' s not part of our lives , but we wish him luck with his , right ?
you think he misses us ?
well , he' d be crazy not to .
mr. marshall , if elected , you' il be the third marshall ... ... to serve new york in the senate .
how does it feel ?
lf i get elected , i' il let you know .
did your father leave you any advice ?
yeah , he said , " don' t run .
we have time for one more question , folks .
then we have a meet and greet in the green room .
i have a question .
what ?
who said that ?
mr. marshall , down here .
sure .
what' s your question ?
i was wondering ....
chris , don' t do this .
no .
wait .
i' m listening .
go ahead .
well ....
i know everyone makes mistakes .
and it' s a sign of character to give a person a second chance , right ?
right .
i' m with you .
even if someone lied , they should be forgiven .
otherwise , we' d never have any congressmen or presidents .
thanks very much .
we have to wrap this up .
jerry , he' s not done .
go on .
well , what if you' re not a politician trying to do good for everybody ?
what if you' re just a regular person , like a maid or something ?
and she made a mistake .
do you think she should get a second chance ?
i mean , nobody' s perfect , right ?
no .
nobody' s perfect .
ladies and gentlemen of the press , take a look at a future candidate .
all right , thanks very much , folks .
we' il see you all in buffalo .
don' t do this .
don' t throw it all  i' m just trusting my instincts here .

eating out of your hands .
thanks .
cool .

have you seen marisa ventura ?
no , i haven' t seen marisa .
