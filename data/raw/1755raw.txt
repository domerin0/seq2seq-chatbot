this is relating to the recall ofamerican troops from abroad .
tragedy struck today as a charter aircraft carrying an army unit returning from duty injapan crashed this morning ... says secretary of the treasury rittenhouse is resigning because his wife is sick .
so who passed rittenhouse the hemlock ?
afl/ clo wanted him off the council of economic advisors for not supporting the pension bill , and the president' s going to need labour next fall .
and state' s still fuming
pentagon is unhappy with his readiness reduction proposals .
greenspan dislikes him .
christ , who didn' t this guy piss off ?
no wonder the wife' s sick .
she' s not sick , she' s a drunk .
how do you know that ?
mike woodward over at treasury .
mrs rittenhouse started drinking a couple ofyears ago when her husband had a series ofaffairs .
stepped it up last summer after their son died of leukaemia .
you want to do something on the price that wives pay ?
mike woodward ?
wife , 3 kids ?
he' s been after me for months .
so i threw him a breakfast and hit him up about rittenhouse .
bob campbell' s leaving , so midnight saturday anchor shift is opening up .
why would i want to give up the white house for a graveyard weekend
no , no , no , not foryou , for me .
no .
beth .
we' il talk about this later .

i' m sorry about this .
we' il get over it .
i love you .
i love you , too .

i was with the secretary since he' s been governor of connecticut .
i came to washington with him .
i moved here because i was dedicated to his career .
i trusted the man ... and then he fucked me .
he what ?
no , i didn' t have sex with him .
i should say i didn' t have sex with him , but somebody sure did .
it was about to come out , so he resigned .
but because i was hired from outside the government pool ,
i don' t get conveyed to the next secretary , so now i' m out a job ...
because he couldn' t keep his hands off women .
do you have proof ?
he thinks he was being so clever .
nobody else could answer it .
i picked it up once .
said hello , and it' s nobody home .
it rings , he shuts the door .
why not hang a sign ?
do you have a name ?
this is what i get for talking to the press .
i' m selling my soul right now .
i can feel it .
i can feel it .
i name a name and get someone into trouble .
so you do have a name .
just a fii rst name .
oh , my god .
i' m going to say it .
ellie .
ellie .
nothing else ?
i think the president knows about it , too .
overheard the secretary talking to him about her .
isn' t washington sick ?
hi .
how you doing ?
can i help you ?
well , actually , we' re looking foryour mom .
is she around ?
my mom' s sick .
she' s not here .
gosh , i love boats .
are you going on a trip ?
yeah .
that' s exciting .
looks like a long trip , huh ?
so , listen , do you know where you' re going ?
she' s going back to the house .
hey , you want to stop that ?
lily , please .
lily , that' s a pretty name .
lily .
do as i say .
go on .
ifwe could just get a minute ofyour time .
what do you want from me ?
we' d like to talk about your resignation .
my wife is sick .
she' s in the hospital .
that' s why i resigned .
everybody knows this .
we could talk about your wife , or we could just talk about ellie .
turn the camera off .
ifyou want to talk to me , turn it off .
we know everything .
nobody knows everything .
well , we know about the secret phone lines and the whispered calls to the president and about a secretary ofthe treasury who' s kept his entire department in the dark about what he' s really doing about a cover story about his resignation thatjust fell through .
you want me to go on ?
and you' re just gonna break it ?
well , that' s what we do for a living .
well , congratulations .
you now have the biggest story in history .
good luck to you .
personally ...
i think it' s a mistake to run the story , but hey , what the hell ?
why not ?
what difference does anything make any more ?
look .
i know you' rejust a reporter , but you used to be a person , right ?
i wanted to be with my family .
can you understand that ?
ok , secretary ofthe treasury alan rittenhouse resigns because ofa mistress named ellie .
the biggest story in history ?
what an ego .
now , if it was the president
whoa , whoa , whoa .
the president has a mistress named ellie , and rittenhouse pretends that he' s having the affair and takes the fall and resigns , and the president buys him a yacht ?
son ofa bitch .
oh , shit .
oh , shit .
right !
ok , ok !
oh , god .
oh , god .
fbl .
ifyou would , please , ma' am .
what do i do with my car ?
we' il take care ofyour car .
just step back to my car .
get her car here .
let' s go .
would you come this way please ?
morton entrekin , ms lerner .
i' m expected back at msnbc at 6 : 00 .
i think i should be there .
people knew about the manhattan project , you know , and they kept it a secret .
that wasjust the creation ofthe atom bomb .
hmm .
ms lerner , tom beck .
i understand you' ve come into some information .
ms lerner wasjust expressing her lack ofenthusiasm for matters of national security wherejournalistic competitiveness is at stake .
mr president , i' m not interested in using ellie to further my career .
what do you know about e. l. e. ?
i know you should have picked a better cover story than a sick wife .
see ?
what did i tell you ?
we' d always thought the deadline for going public was the publication ofthe budget , since we' ve spent more money than we can hide .
the budget comes out in 2 weeks .
i don' t suppose i could convince you to sit on this for 2 weeks .
no such thing as 2 weeks in the news business .
and i can' t appeal to your sense ofwhat' s in the nation' s best interest ?
i always thought the truth was in the nation' s best interest .
you want to hold her ?
what ifwe go public in 48 hours ?
now that' s doable , isn' t it ?
that would be very diffiicult , mr president .
morton , ifshe knows , how long can it be before cnn or the post breaks the story ?
this was never gonna be a secret as long as you wanted it to be .
give us 2 days , ms lerner .
you' il get second row , centre , at the white house press conference .
now , from what i know ofyour career , that' s a promotion .
i want exclusivity .
now , listen , young lady .
this is a presidential favour .
i' m letting you go because i don' t want another headache .
and i' m trusting you because i know what this can do foryour career .
it might seem that we have each other over the same barrel , ms lerner , but itjust seems that way .
i want
want ?
may i ...
may i have the fii rst question ?
we' il see you tuesday , ms lerner .
come on , come on .
e. l. e. , e. l. e.
paleontology ?
paleontology ?
what' s paleontology have to do with anything ?
come on .
hey .
hey .
look who' s working late .
how' s rittenhouse going ?
no sign ofthe wife yet .
is she missing ?
no .
we' re still working on it .
we' il get there .
i know , it' s a dull story .
next time we' il get you something more exciting .
great .
are you ok ?
yeah .
want to come to dinner with us ?
i can' t .
i have plans .
ok .
we' il see you tomorrow .
thankyou .
ah , here she is .
jenny .
hello .
hi , chloe .
would you like some champagne , miss ?
martini ... big .
i missed you .
i mean we missed you yesterday .
i must say , i' m ...
i' m disturbed that you didn' t come to our wedding .
jason , you promised .
i know i promised , but it was a beautiful event , and i missed her .
you should have been there .
the twins , they were running around like mad and throwing flowers .
it was wonderful , especially emma .
you know , the little one .
she loves you .
it was beautiful .
she missed you , too .
all right .
this is from us foryou .
are you not going to open it ?
i knew she wouldn' t ...
you can exchange them ifyou don' t like them .
jenny , i know this is hard .
i just want you to be happy .
happy .
well ,
i would like to propose a toast to happiness and to
mmm .
mmm .
are we going to have an evening or not ?
jenny , i know that you hate me .
i know that you have terrible things that you want to say to me .
you have to get over it .
life goes on .
life goes on ?
ok .
what' s so funny ?
life ...
we' il see .
what' s so funny about " life goes on " ?
life going on ?
i don' t think it' s funny that life goes on .
dad , you need to get back together with mom .
she' s all alone in the world , and she needs you right now .
ok ?
jenny .
i just got married .
i know , and i' m sorry .
chloe , this has nothing to do with you .
well , it has to do something for me , for christ' s sake .
this is insane .
i have to apologize for my daughter .
it' s not your fault .
i' m sorry .
i have to go .
i know you think i' m a bad person .
i' m really not .
and i don' t hate you .
i just i gotta go .
' cause for her , it doesn' t excuse me .
jenny .
hey .
what are you doing here ?
uh , yeah .
did stuart send you here without telling me ?
no .
ifstuart thinks he can push me out ofthe white house
ms lerner .
hi , beth .
right this way .
i' ve got you right down here .
excuse me , please .
ok .
he' il fii nd you for the fii rst question .
then you' re on your own .
hey , how are you ?
ladies and gentlemen .
ladies and gentlemen , please .
the president will begin by addressing the nation .
please hold your questions until he' s fii nished his remarks .
ladies and gentlemen , the president ofthe united states .
hello , everybody .
mr president .
hello .
1 0 seconds , mr president .
5 , 4 .
good evening .
a few minutes ago the united states ambassadors to every country in the world told the leaders ofthose nations what i am about to tell you .
it' s a bit complicated , so it will take some time , so i hope you will bear with me , hear what i have to say .
a little over a year ago , 2 american astronomers , marcus wolfand leo biederman , working on a mountain top in arizona ...
shh .
nobody say anything . saw something in the night sky that caused them great concern .
a comet .
but the comet was , well ...
there was a remote possibility that the comet was on a path that could bring it into direct contact with the earth .
now ... we get hit all the time by rocks and meteors , some ofthem the size ofcars , some no bigger than your hand .
but the comet we discovered is the size of new york city .
from the north side of central park to the battery .
about 7 miles long .
put another way , this comet is larger than mount everest .
it weighs 500 billion tons .
now , chances are ...
astrophysicists , geologists and climatologists .
where the hell is science ?
check with tokyo , tel aviv .
i want everybody .
the hale bopp stand ups .
graphics !
i need graphics !
comets begin far out in space .
they' re what' s left over from the creation ofthe solar system after the planets were formed billions ofyears ago .
these chunks ofspace debris are in an elongated orbit around our sun , but every now and then one ofthem gets bumped
iike a billiard ball on a pool table and is knocked into a different orbit .
ifthis comet continues on its path around the sun and keeps its present course , sometime on august 1 6 , roughly a year from now , there' s a chance that we might have impact .
so for the past 8 months , the united states and russia have been building the largest spaceship ever constructed .
it' s being built in orbit around the earth .
and we call it the messiah .
right now a team ofamerican astronauts and one russian are at cape canaveral in florida .
in 2 months , they will leave on the shuttle atlantis to board the messiah .
this is the crew that will stop the comet .
i' d like the world to meet some extraordinary people .
first is mission commander oren monash .
commander , would you introduce us to your team ?
i' d be honoured , sir .
pilot andrea baker .
medical offiicer
gus partenza .
from russia , nuclear specialist
colonel mikhail tulchinsky .
navigator mark simon and rendezvous pilot spurgeon tanner .
hello , mr president .
captain tanner , you flew 6 shuttle missions .
you were the last man to walk on the moon , weren' t you ?
yes , sir , but oren here will be doing most ofthe flying on this one .
i' il just be taking us down to the comet' s surface .
well , it' s good to know we' re going to have your kind ofexperience up there , captain .
thankyou , sir .
godspeed to you all .
we' re counting on you .
thankyou , sir .
got beijing , rome , sao paulo , cairo , berlin !
does anyone know how big the one was that killed all the dinosaurs ?
something majestic , mysterious , with a fanfare for the intro and a theme for the longer promos .
you want it hitting the goddam earth ?
well , that' s what he' s saying .
bring that up again .
it' il scare the shit out ofthem .
we will not tolerate any disruption ofour way of life .
our society will continue as normal .
work will go on .
you will pay your bills .
there will be no hoarding .
there will be no sudden profiiteering .
i' m freezing all wages , all prices .
what a bottle ofwater cost you yesterday ... it will cost you tomorrow .
now we' il take a few questions .
mr president !
ms lerner .
ahem .
ahem .
uh, jenny lerner , m msnbc .
jenny lerner ?
son ofa bitch .
um , mr president , why wasn' t this announcement made sooner ?
well , until we knew we could build the rocket and the comet could be intercepted , we saw no reason to alarm the planet .
sir !
mr president !
do you have another question , ms lerner ?
yeah .
um ...
is is there a connection between the comet and the recall ofamerican troops from abroad ?
our fii ghting men and women are coming home because we felt it prudent , in light ofdomestic security concerns , to have them available .
although i certainly hope we don' t need to use them .
next question .
mr president !
actually , mr president , if just one fii nal question , sir .
um ...
msnbc has learned that secretary rittenhouse did not leave for the reasons announced by your administration .
in fact , isn' t it true , sir , that not everyone in your administration is convinced that the messiah will save us ?
secretary rittenhouse served his country with full devotion .
he resigned for personal reasons .
now , i can promise you this , ms lerner , all ofyou , everyone in this room and everyone listening to my voice , that at some point over the next 1 0 months , all of us will entertain our worst fears and concerns .
but i can also promise you this .
life will go on .
we will prevail .
mr president !
please !
sally .
sir , what is the comet' s name ?
the 2 scientists who found the comet were killed in a car crash while racing from their observatory to alert the world .
so we named it for them .
wolf biederman .
leo biederman , they said it again .
shh !
leo , is he talking about you ?
he is , isn' t he ?
can you get that , please ?
janie , get the door .
well , we have the technology to build the ship .
they have the technology to make it go .
there' s someone at the door foryou , leo .
you' ve been watching live coverage of president tom beck ...
i can' t believe this .
this is so weird .
dr wolf from astronomy club ?
yeah , i guess so .
i think it' s really neat .
nobody on our block discovered the world was gonna end before .
he' s still very much alive .
he' s still alive , everyone .
he' s right here , and he' s still alive .
ok ?
hey , leo , cool !
as far as we know , what happened was that doctor wolf saw the comet in my photograph , so he shared the discovery with me , and then he was killed in that crash and everything got mixed up in washington , so the president thought i was dead , too .
leo !
leo !
jasmine .
how does it feel having your name on it ?
i don' t want anyone to think that i' m trying to take something away from dr wolf , because i' m not , but it' s kind ofcool .
leo !
leo !
jason .
you know , you' re gonna have sex a lot more now than anyone else in our class .
don' t listen .
don' t .
really ?
thankyou foryour sexual insight , mr thurman .
you can sit down now .
famous people always get sex , mr perry .
that' s the main reason it' s good to be famous .
fruit a reactor , bottle a rocket , ok ?
a nuclear reactor in space ?
yes .
isn' t that dangerous ?
no , no , no .
this is all russian design .
russian science .
uh , the same people who designed chernobyl .
chernobyl ?
chernobyl almost worked .
so what happens afteryou plant the bomb ?
well , we have 7 hours .
we' re gonna put the bombs inside the comet .
i' m gonna follow these two .
i don' t trust that combination .
after 7 hours , the 1 4 hour rotational cycle ofthe comet spins .
we' re gonna get married .
god knows i want to marry you , but the day i get back , the last thing i' m gonna do is step inside ofa church .
i don' t do churches well .
' cause there' s only 7 hours ofdarkness .
then the sun starts hitting the surface ofthe planet ...
these are your orders .
upon fii rst entering earth' s atmosphere , proceed immediately up the exterior ofthe mother ship .
when the sun hits the surface , there' s gonna be explosive outgassings that are very dangerous
gus , he' s 7 .
brittany .
you boys were , what , 4 and 6 when i went to the moon ?
yeah .
now , you saw me go into space 7 times , didn' t ya ?
i came back every time , didn' t l ?
yeah .
your mother and i used to play a game when she was still alive .
now , the game was , ifthere was a chance i might not be coming back , she wouldn' t say it , and i wouldn' t say it .
ok ?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
hey , fish .
how about a beer ?
you remember my boys , don' t you ?
steve and dwight .
ofcourse i do .
gentlemen , welcome to houston .
let me steal your old man for a second .
can i take your picture , please ?
ok .
thankyou .
so , what do you think ofthe crew ?
heroes all .
that' s the fii nest group i ever had the privilege ofworking with .
yeah , yeah .
off the record , huh ?
well , they' ve been trained in ways i' il never understand .
they' re smarter and in better shape than we ever were in the old days .
they' re sober , serious .
i guess i' d be a little happier about this whole thing if i thought that any ofthem were as scared as i am .
well , they' re not scared ofdyin ' .
they' rejust scared of looking bad on tv .
now , look , i wish i' d been to the moon .
i got respect for everybody who' s gone to the moon , but this mission ain' t going to the moon .
that' s right .
frank gifford , he was a great football player in his time , but if he played now , he' d get his ass busted .
that' s right .
all i' m saying is , the moon did not have a rotational cycle of 1 4 hours .
i mean , we only have 7 hours ofdark when the sun' s not up to land on this thing .
it was light when he landed .
this is gonna be dark .
we' re not gonna be able to see .
you can' t see now , gus .
don' t worry , don' t worry , don' t worry .
we what ?
we can do it .
no , no , no .
sit down .
i woke up this morning , and i realized ... none ofyou want me here .
you don' t even really know who i am , which is ok .
i walked on the moon , but i didn' t belong to you .
i belonged to your daddies .
now , if i askyou to askyour daddies what i meant to them , to explain to you what i' m doing here , that' s only gonna make things worse .
so ... what do we do ?
you haven' t trained for this mission .
we respect you .
i appreciate that .
but you' re here ... you' re here because the powers that be think we need a familiar face on this trip .
you' re here for public relations .
no , no .
i' m here because the powers that be know that i' m the only person on this mission who' s ever landed on the moon .
and i have 500 landings on aircraft carriers .
we' ve trained on
on flight simulators .
right ?
i mean , this is not a video game , son .
it really isn' t .
it really isn' t .
no .
we are go for auto sequence start .
atlantis ' 4 on board computers now have primary control ofall the vehicle' s critical functions .
ok , all flight controllers , we' re at t minus 30 seconds and counting .
let' s take a close look .
apus look good ,
lox and lh2 are pressurized .
1 0 , 9 ...
we' re go for auto sequence .
roger, jerry .
good luck and godspeed , atlantis .
thanks , mitch .
3 , 2 , 1 .
propelled by 500, 000 pounds of liquid fuel , the shuttle crew heads toward their initial destination .
when the crew enters the messiah , they will fii nd a payload of 8 nuclear devices that will eventually be used to blow up the comet .
the messiah itself will be powered by an experimental nuclear propulsion system that was originally created for a very different purpose .
that programme was called orion .
now , with the help of russian engineers , a technology designed to propel weapons of mass destruction will power the ship that will intercept the greatest threat our planet has ever faced .
orion burn ... in 1 0 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 .
ok , beth , white house reactions .
marianne , the whole world watching .
we have enough satellite space ?
78 uplinks .
tim , mission control in houston .
ira , the science guys lined up ?
ifthey got a ph. d. , we own them .
all right , this is the most important story ofour lives .
let' s not muck it up .
stuart , what about me ?
you' re on the anchor desk .
whoa !
and you could have been there a lot sooner .
what are you talking about ?
you know what i' m talking about .
don' t ever hold back a story from me again .

you' re on bi prop .
this is a special presentation of msnbc news withjenny lerner .
good evening .
sometime in the next hour , the messiah mission will enter its most critical phase : the interception ofwolf biederman and the setting of the nuclear devices that will deflect it off its collision course with earth .
but fii rst , captain spurgeon tanner will have to guide the spacecraft through the blizzard of rocks , sand , and ice that make up the comet' s tail , or coma .
the crew will have to complete its work before the sun rises .
sublimator looks good , mick .
disengaging auto now .
i' m eyeballs out from here on in .
how come that doesn' t make me feel any better ?
i heard that .
lights on .
cameras on .
on the mississippi river in mark twain' s time , there were riverboat pilots who only knew a few miles ofthe river .
i mean , conditions changed so much , you couldn' t know the whole trip .
floods , sandbars , fallen logs
it was all a riverboat pilot could do was to know his little piece ofthe puzzle .
so for the next few hours , this is my ship .
we start our approach .
jenny : ... are images from cameras mounted inside the cargo bay ofthe messiah .
now , these images are delayed by approximately 20 seconds , due to the distance they must travel .
ok , you can see that the image is breaking up a bit .
uh , houston is prepared for this .
they' ve informed us that due to the uncertain make up ofthe comet' s coma , they' re unsure whether or not transmission will be possible .
ok , now , now , it ap appears we' re losing reception here .
ok , we' ve we' ve lost picture now .
but we will stay on the air .
we' il stay with you through all ofthis .
dap is in descent .
roger , descent .
oh , my god .
look at these .
they' re the size of houses .
yeah , i know .
i see .

ok .
start the clock .
jenny : lfall is going according to schedule , the astronauts should now be placing the moles on the comet surface .
the moles are , well , they' re what they sound like .
they are drilling machines that burrow to a depth of 1 00 metres , where they wait to be detonated .
each one carries a 5, 000 kiloton warhead .
how' s our time ?
it' s getting tight .
1 : 36 : 30 .
it' s taking too long .
yup .
what happens if they do not get off the comet' s surface in time ?
the sun striking the comet will cause the temperature to rise 350 degrees in just a few minutes and activate the high speed gasjets .
well , ifthat happens , it will be like trying to work in a minefiield .
mark , what' s your mole 4 readout ?
mole 4 running true at 75 feet .
son ofa bitch .
what ?
it' s stuck .
try backing it up .
what' s your depth ?
75 feet .
is that enough ?
no .
that' il just break pieces off the surface .
that' s not deep enough .
yeah , fish , i know that' s not deep enough .
i' m going in .
oren , no .
no , i' m gonna see if i can free it up .
stand by , tether attached .
all right , i gotcha .
oren , suit pressure , 3 . 5 .
come on , come on .
how' s my time ?
23 : 57 .
another 6 minutes , they won' t have time to get back to us .
blow the tethers .
let' s go get ' em .
ifwe go after them , we may not have enough fuel to get off the surface .
blow the goddam tethers .
mole 3 at depth .
we' re heading your way , oren .
calculate exactly how much prop we need to get off this rock .
we' il shut it down when we hit it .
will do .
it opens up into a cave down here .
mole gotjammed against the side .
ok , fish , team 2 at location 4 .
give me your hand .
what the hell happened ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
everything was going great , and we gotjammed up at 75 feet .
ok , hold up .
all right , try backing it up .
roger that .
that' s it .
a little more .
shut it down .
no , they always put extra in these tanks .
fish , shut it down .
ok .
come on , you bastard !
come on !
time !
1 : 02 .
figured we' d better pick you kids up after school .
checkyour 6 , 1 00 yards .
i think we' d better hurry , boys .
all right , it' s going !
it' s going !
mole' s at 1 25 feet .
the sun' s rising behind you .
it' s coming up fast .
face shields down !
oh , christ !
get the hell out ofthere !
aah !
oren , get your visor down .
get your visor down !
oh !
my eyes !
ohh !
all right , we got him .
oh , god !
my eyes !
oh , god , we' re losing one .
he' s got escape velocity .
1 , 000 feet and climbing .
aah !
mark , mikhail , get the hell out ofthere !
firing primary thrusters .
payload doors still open .
close ' em as we go .
houston , all moles are at depth .
nukes hot and ready .
we lost partenza to explosive outgassing .
and monash is injured .
we have to go get gus .
there' s no time for that .
repressurize the cargo bay .
he' s going to die out there !
we can still fii nd him .
he has a beacon .
i don' t have time to argue with you .
just sit down and be quiet .
turn on the fuckin ' locator !
we' ve used most ofour propellant to get us out ofthe coma .
we can' tjust leave him .
we have to go back !
ifwe go back for gus , we all die .
we can' tjust leave him in space !
sit down , mick .
sit down .
it' s ok .
the messiah has safely lifted off the comet .
but sadly , gus partenza has been lost .
gus partenza , a native of harrisburg , pennsylvania , and graduate of carnegie mellon university , joined the nasa space programme shortly after completing his medical training at duke university .
dr partenza was selected specifiically for this mission , not only for his medical expertise , but also for his dedication to the advancement ofspace technology .
yeah .
with the loss of dr gus partenza and with oren monash injured ,
captain spurgeon tanner is now in charge ofthe mission .
the messiah has successfully docked with the orion powered boosters and is now prepared to detonate the bombs planted on wolf biederman .
the messiah' s exterior mounted camera will show us the detonation , but not before being temporarily blocked out by the nuclear blast .
once again , let me remind you , there is a 20 second delay , so when the picture comes back to us , the comet should already have been knocked off its present course .
prepare to remove safeties and fii re .
safeties removed .
weapons armed .
3 , 2 , 1 ...
now .
so now we' rejust waiting for the picture to come back .
decompression in area 6 .
mick !
i' il get the halon !
aah !
yes .
i' m still here .
we' re live in 1 0 seconds .
cue the president .
mr president , 5 , 4 , 3 ...
hello , america .
it is my unhappy duty to report to you that the messiah has failed .
this computer enhanced radar image from houston shows how the detonation succeeded , however , did not destroy the comet .
there are now 2 pieces one 6 miles wide , the other , a mile and a half .
both are still on a path towards earth .
we' ve lost communication with the messiah spacecraft , although we continue to track it visually .
we don' t know how many are alive .
we don' t know their condition .
now , we have to make some decisions together .
what do we do ?
you have a choice .
we have a choice ...
right now .
ever since the comet was discovered , we' ve been hoping and working for the best , but we' ve also been planning for the worst .
our strategy has been twofold .
first , our strategic missile command is preparing to coordinate with the russians a massive strike oftitan missiles to intercept the comets .
ifwe can deflect these comets enough , they will bounce harmlessly off our atmosphere and head on out into space .
unfortunately , the titans cannot be launched until the comets are only a few hours away .
and while we are confiident the missile attack will succeed , it is only prudent that we now take cautionary steps to ensure the continuation ofour way of life , to guarantee that there will be enough of us left to rebuild a new world in the unlikely event that the comets do strike the earth .
so , in the soft limestone of missouri , we' ve been preparing a network of immense caves , and they' re almost fii nished .
and we can put a million people in them .
and that million people can survive there , underground , for 2 years , until the air clears and the dust settles .
now , the cave is more than a dormitory .
it' s our new noah' s ark .
we' re storing seeds and seedlings , plants , animals , enough to start over .
on august 1 0th , a computer will randomly select 800, 000 americans tojoin the 200, 000 scientists , doctors , engineers , teachers , soldiers , and artists , who have already been chosen .
other countries are preparing similar caves along whatever lines they feel are best to preserve their way of life .
this is ours .
beginning tonight and continuing until the crisis passes ,
i am declaring a state of martial law .
the armed forces and the national guard are working with local law enforcement .
a national curfew begins at midnight tonight .
now , whereveryou are , go home .
stay off the roads after sunset .
crimes against persons or property will be dealt with swiftly and harshly .
news stations around the nation are being faxed copies ofthe lottery procedure as we speak , and they' il be broadcasting the details to you in a few moments .
i wish ...
no .
wishing is wrong .
it' s the wrong word right now .
that' s not what i mean .
what i mean is ...
i believe in god .
relax .
i know a lot ofyou don' t , but i still want to offer a prayer ... for our survival .
mine included .
because i believe that god , whomeveryou hold that to be , hears all prayers , even ifsometimes the answer is no .
so , may the lord bless you .
may the lord keep you .
may the lord lift up his divine countenance upon you ... and give you peace .
and in 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 ...
we now have the details for the national lottery .
those ofyou who have been preselected will be notifiied within the next few minutes .
for the rest , on the night ofaugust 1 0th , those whose social security numbers have been randomly selected by computer will be notifiied .
while some americans ... over 50 years ofage have been preselected for the ark due to their expertise in a necessary fiield ofstudy , no men and women over 50 in the general population will be included in the lottery .
the ...
the evac the evacuation ofthose who have been selected for the ark will take no longer than 2 days , beginning on august 1 2th .
during this 2 day period , no unoffiicial travel will be permitted .
those selected will be taken by bus and train to the underground ark site by military personnel .
civil defence teams have been formed in every town with a population over 5, 000 .
they will distribute supplies and organize group shelters in underground parking facilities and other appropriate sites .
construction plans ...
equipment lists , and locations for securing the necessary provisions ...
hello ?
yes , this is ellen biederman .
jenny : " ... on how to grow your own food underground and how to purify water are now available on the internet at www ...
we' ve been preselected .
jenny : " ... fcda . gov .
chuck ?
chuck ?
where are you going ?
our phone .
they could be calling .
jenny : " ... beginning on august 9th .
the only phones that ring will be those ofthe people selected .
that' s it .
that' s all there is .
the interior camera circuitry is shot .
so , andy , can we get back into the cargo bay to reroute the video functions ?
starboard cargo porthole' s blown .
we could go in with the evas , but there' s not much left in the life support packs .
we should be able to raise houston on the low band once we get closer .
and the orion is still functioning ?
system check was ok , but i don' t know about the radiation shielding .
so , ifwe fii re it up , we beat the comet back to earth , but we may end up glowing in the dark .
right ?
ok , so , uh ...
anybody ?
let' s go home .
ok .
i have to say it' s liberating knowing that i' m not going to be called .
i don' t think i' ve ever been happier .
i' ve even stopped smoking .
what are you gonna do with all that extra money you save ?
do you know the national gallery is saving all ofthe art ?
they' re shipping it to the caves .
i' ve given them my beautiful 1 8th century desk from new england and all the sheraton silver .
i really feel like i' d protected something when i gave them .
you should see my apartment .
there' s nothing there .
it' s practically japanese .
seems kind of unfair that i got picked .
you know , i' m not a doctor or a scientist .
people need continuity .
everyone knows you .
and they trust you .
but i ... can' t help you .
don' t worry about me .
i' m gonna be happy as long as i know you' re going to live .
mr hotchner ?
who did i think i was going to be when i bought that bike ?
well , every kid on the block wants one now .
every parent on the block hates you for it .
that' s the best news i' ve had in years .
um , sir ?
could you give me a hand over here for a second ?
yes , sir .
i just want to get these bars up .
hi , mrs hotchner .
a mob attacked and killed a miami rental yard operator who was charging $5, 000 an hour for backhoe and tractor rentals .
marines intervened to stop the violence .
mrs hotchner ?
sarah' s on the hill .
thankyou .
where were you today ?
i' ve been looking all over foryou .
why weren' t you at school ?
my dad said i didn' t have to go .
he said there' s no point .
i talked to civil defence .
they said if you and i got married we' d be family , and i could get you in .
what about my parents ?
they' re not your family .
i don' t want to go without my parents .
you don' t have to .
i' m the famous leo biederman , and i haven' t used my fame for anything , but i got them to let your family go , too .
you this is your only chance to survive .
across the country ,
iooters continue to set fii re to abandoned stores .
the fii res have been left to burn since many fii refii ghters have been called to help prepare shelters .
throughout latin america' s major cities , business districts have been abandoned to looting gangs ...
airlifts have been ruled out as too dangerous .
more street fii ghting in moscow as food and fuel shortages continue .
believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
when i was a child , i spoke like a child ,
i thought like a child ,
i reasoned like a child .
when i became a man , i gave up childish ways .
for now we see in a mirror dimly , but then face to face .
now i know in part , then i shall understand fully , even as i have been fully understood .
do you , leo , take sarah to be your wife ... to have and to hold from this day forward ... for better , for worse ... for richer , for poorer ... to love and to cherish ?
i now pronounce you husband and wife .
here , let me help you .
i' il get it .
yeah .
how you feeling ?
all right .
i want to tell you something .
you children didn' t bring any real books to read , did you know that ?
i brought moby dick and huckleberry finn and baker and simon had never read them .

hmm ?
hey , i' m a child ofthe movies , fish .
ok , i see .
so ...
you got a shitty deal , oren , you know that ?
you really did .
don' t worry about me .
yeah .
i mean that .

what do you mean by that ?
gotta be the best .
oh , i see .
be ... the best .
sometimes i see flashes of light ...
you know , like ... colours .
yeah .
i fall asleep ... and i dream .
but there' s a part of me that' s always awake .
and i can see myself dreaming .
i' m seeing things differently , fish .
well , that' s good .
fish ... why the hell do they call you " fish " ?
well , i ...
spurgeon , sturgeon , fiish .

mm hmm .
and this one , too .
she was such an artist , don' t you think so ?
you don' t remember when we take them , hmm ?
i' m 5 years old .
how would i remember that ?
some people do remember when they were 5 years old .
it was such a beautiful day .
all alone on the beach .
and , ofcourse , she would have been in the picture , but there was no one else to hold the camera , and ... she insisted .
you know how she is .
how she was .
jenny .
it was such a good day for all of us .
don' t you remember ?
keep them .
goodbye .
we have now confii rmed the launch ofall the titan missiles from their positions in north dakota and wyoming .
the comets are now approximately 1 4 hours outside of earth' s atmosphere , and we are told it should take these missiles
iess than 20 minutes to reach their target .
ok , here' s what we' re looking at .
all ofthe titans have been launched .
we still won' t know if they' ve made a difference .
the comets have to travel for a while before the radar tracking stations can see ifthey' ve been pushed to a safe course that' il bypass the earth .
so , one more time we have to wait .
are we on ?
we' re on , mr president .
our missiles have failed .
the comets are still headed for earth ... and there' s nothing we can do to stop them .
so , this is it .
ifthe world does go on ... it will not go on for everyone .
we have now been able to calculate the comets ' fii nal trajectories , and we have determined where they' re going to strike .
the smaller ofthe 2 comets , biederman , will hit fii rst , somewhere along the atlantic seaboard probably in the waters off the coast of cape hatteras in just under 1 2 hours at 4 : 35 p . m . eastern daylight time .
the impact ofthe comet is going to be ...
well , disastrous .
there will be a very large tidal wave moving quickly through the atlantic ocean .
it will be 1 00 feet high , travelling at 1 , 1 00 miles an hour .
that' s faster than the speed ofsound .
as it reaches shallow water , it' s going to slow down , but the wave height , depending on the depth ofthe shelfoff the coast , will be anywhere from 1 , 000 to 3, 500 feet high .
where the land is flat , the wave will wash inland 600 to 700 miles .
the wave will hit our nation' s capital 40 minutes after impact .
new york city , boston , atlanta , philadelphia ... all will be destroyed .
ifyou have any means of getting away from the path ofthis wave ,
ieave now .
the impact ofthe larger comet will be nothing less than an extinction level event .
it will strike land in western canada 3 hours after biederman .
within a week , the skies will be dark with dust from the impact and they will stay dark for 2 years .
all plant life will be dead within ... 4 weeks .
animal life within ... a few months .
so that' s it .
good luck to us all .
could i bother everyone for a minute ?
let' s take a look at the big one .
now , the outgassing has created a vent a half mile wide and at least 2 miles deep .
comet gets closer to the sun , sun melts the ice , ice turns to steam , we get a big hole , ok ?
so , how many nukes do we have left in the back ?
4 .
ifwe can get the remaining bombs in that vent , there shouldn' t be anything left bigger than a suitcase .
we can' t do anything about the little one , but itjust might give them a chance .
without the arming codes , we' re going to have to wait to set the bomb timers until we get closer to earth to raise houston .
we may not have enough life support left to get back into the cargo bay for the nukes , much less to go down to the comet .
we sure as hell don' t have enough propellant left in the messiah to manoeuvre with .
how are we supposed to get back off the surface once we' ve gotten down there ?
we don' t .
well , look at the bright side .
we' il all have high schools named after us .
houston , this is messiah .
houston , this is messiah .
nice ofyou to call , messiah .
we were beginning to wonder what you were doing up there .
admiring the view , houston .
fish , is that you ?
yep .
we don' t have time to talk , houston .
there' s nothing we can do about the smaller one , but we do have a plan .
we need the arming codes for the last 4 nukes .
arming codes ?
what the hell for ?
we can do or we can teach .
what' s your pleasure ?
get the arming codes !
get the goddam codes !
we have one helicopter .
holds 7 people .
we can ferry 6 people to high ground in west virginia and takejenny to the ark .
short stick goes .
i thought it was women and children fii rst .
ifyou get the short one , you can give up your seat .
thank god .
well , that makes sense .
i got a stick .
i got a stick .
i' m sorry , beth .
ok , honey , here we go .
let' s go now .
beth ...
there' s always the road .
we' il be ok .
come on .
ah , that' s my girl .
ok , that' s it .

sarah !
where' s that key ?
where' s the key ?
come on !
hurry up !
come on !
no , wait .
what are you doing ? !
we have to go now .
come on !
come on !
beth , what are you doing ?
the road was so crowded .
we weren' t gonna make it .
i thought ifthe wave comes , we should be here because she likes it here .
and we' re on the 1 5th floor , so maybe we' il be ok .
say goodbye tojenny what are you doing ? !

it' s been a pleasure serving with you , commander .
the honour' s all mine , andy .
be good , oren .
be good .
we watched as the bombs shattered the second comet into a million of pieces of ice and rock that burned harmlessly in our atmosphere and lit up the sky for an hour .
still , we were left with the devastation ofthe fii rst .
the waters reached as far inland as the ohio and tennessee valleys .
it washed away farms and towns ... forests and skyscrapers .
but the water receded .
the wave hit europe and africa , too .
millions were lost .
countless more left homeless .
but the waters receded .
cities fall ... but they are rebuilt .
and heroes die ... but they are remembered .
we honour them with every brick we lay ... with every fiield we sow ... with every child we comfort and then teach to rejoice in what we have been regiven .
our planet .
our home .
so now ...
iet us begin .
