between the time when the oceans drank atlantis ... andthe rise of the sons of aryas , there was an age undreamed of ; and unto this , conan , destined to bear the jeweled crown of aquilonia ... upon a troubledbrow .
it is i , his chronicler , who alone can tell thee of his saga .
let me tell you of the days of high adventure .
fire and wind come from the sky , from the gods ofthe sky .
but crom is your god .
crom , and he lives in the earth .
once giants lived in the earth , conan .
and in the darkness of chaos ... they fooled crom , and they took from him the enigma of steel .
crom was angered , and the earth shook .
and fire and wind struck down these giants , and they threw their bodies into the waters .
but in their rage , the gods forgot the secret of steel and left it on the battlefield .
and we who found it ... are just men .
not gods .
not giants .
just men .
and the secret of steel has always carried with it a mystery .
you must learn its riddle , conan .
you must learn its discipline .
for no one , no one in this world can you trust ; not men , not women , not beasts .
this you can trust .
conan !
kill that one first !
no !
no !
over there !
you !
get him !
the ashes were trampled into the earth , andthe blood became ass now .
who knows what they came for ?
weapons of steel ?
or murder ?
it was never known , for the leader rode to the south ... while children went north with the vanir .
no one would ever know ... that my lord' s people had lived at all .
his was a tale of sorrow .
sit here .
sit here !
life and death , the same .
only that the crowd would be there ... to greet him with howls of lust and fury .
he began to realize his sense of worth .
he mattered .
ln time , his victories could not easily be counted .
he was taken to the east , a great prize , where the warmasters would teach him the deepest secrets .
hai !
language and writing were made available . : the poetry of kitai , the philosophy of sung .
andhe also came to know the pleasures of women ... when he was bred to the finest stock .
but always there remained ... the discipline of steel .
my fear is that my sons will never understand me .
we' ve won again !
this is good , but what is best in life ?
the open steppe , a fleet horse , falcons at your wrists ... and the wind in your hair .
wrong !
conan , what is best in life ?
to crush your enemies , see them driven before you ... and to hear the lamentation of their women .
that is good .
that is good .
go !
go !
you' re free !
go !
it has been surmised ... that perhaps my lord was like a wild animal ... that had been kept too long .
perhaps .
but whatever , freedom , so long an unremembered dream , washis .
crom .
there' s warmth and fire .
do you not wish to warm yourself by my fire ?
they said you would come .
from the north , a man of great strength .
a conqueror .
a man who would someday be king by his own hand .
one who would crush the snakes ofthe earth  snakes ?
did you say snakes ?
what is it you seek ?
a standard .
a symbol , perhaps on a shield .
two snakes coming together .
facing each other .
but they' re one .
with ... with a sun ... and a moon below .
blacksun , blackmoon .
yes .
there' s a price , barbarian .
zamora .
the ... crossroads ... of the world .
you will ... [ moaning ]
find ... what ... you want ... in zamora .
ohh !
crom !
food .
food !
i have not eaten for days .
and who says you will ?
give me food so i have strength when the wolves come .
let me die not in hunger , but in combat .
who are you ?
i am subotai , thief and archer .
i am hyrkanian , the great order of kerlait .
so what are you doing here ?
dinner for wolves .
what gods do you pray to ?
i pray to the four winds .
and you ?
to crom .
but i seldom pray to him .
he doesn' t listen .
what good is he , then ?
ah , it' s just as i' ve always said .
he is strong .
lf i die , i have to go before him , and he will ask me , " what is the riddle of steel ?
lf i don' t know it , he will cast me out of valhalla and laugh at me .
that' s crom .
strong on his mountain .
ah , my god is greater .
ha ha !
crom laughs at your four winds ,
laughs from his mountain .
my god is stronger .
he is the everlasting sky .
your god lives underneath him .
civilization , ancient and wicked .
have you ever seen this before ?
no .
let' s waste no time !
it' s good .
you have no idea how long it' s been there .
so much meat ... stink .
does it always smell like this ?
how does the wind ever get in here ?
how about two snakes coming together over a black sun ?
a magnificent standard .
the only snakes i know of are those of set and those cursed towers .
they have spread to every city .
two or three years ago , it was just another snake cult .
now , everywhere .
it is said that they are deceivers .
they murder people in the night .
i know nothing .
hey .
black lotus .
stygian , the best .
this better not be haga .
i would sell haga to a slayer such as you ?
a pittance to protect you from evil .
i am evil .
they' re all sluts !
he' s dead already .
can you believe that ?
huh ?
can you b [ snorts ]
you' re too big to be a thief .
come .
let' s leave this place .
you' re looking for snakes .
they live in the tower of the serpent , said to have riches without end and the greatest jewel of all : the eye of the serpent .
chew it slowly !
it' s the good stuff .
you are not a guard .
neither are you .
we are thieves ...
like yourself .
we come to climb the tower .
you don' t even have a rope .
two fools who laugh at death .
do you know what horrors lie beyond that wall ?
no .
then you go first .
ohh !
what on earth could smell so bad ?
do you want to live forever ?
that one .
he' s the high priest , second only to thulsa doom .
they say thulsa doom' s a thousand years old .
i' il see what' s here .
go find out what' s below .
lnfidels !
lnfidels !
ahh !
kill them !
do you want to live forever ?
all manner of pleasures and diversions were indulged .
wealth can be wonderful .
but you know , success can test one' s mettle ... assurely as the strongest adversary .
they were taken to the hall ofking osric the usurper , once a powerful northman like my lord ... but now old and sotted .
these are the thieves you have requested , sire .
i thought there were three .
o o our companion , he died in the gardens .
lions ate him .
lions ate him ?
the lions ate him .
do you know what you' ve done ?
why , rexor himself has come before me , threatened me , a king !
what daring !
what outrageousness !
what insolence !
what arrogance !
i salute you .
thulsa doom .
i' ve chafed for years at this demigod .
snakes in my beautiful city .
nemedia , aquilonia .
koth , stygia , snakes .
everywhere these evil towers .
you alone have stoodup to their gods .
and what are you ?
thieves !
see this ?
they call it the " fangs of the serpent .
and this one ... was thrust into a father' s heart by his very son .
and my own daughter ... has fallen under this thulsa doom' s spell .
ls there a dagger such as this ... in her hand for me ?
she follows him as a slave , seeking for the truth of her soul ... as if i could not give it to her !
as we speak ... my daughter travels east ... to thulsa doom and his mountain of power .
she is to be his !
steal my daughter back .
take all you can carry .
there' s more .
much more .
enough to become kings yourselves .
there comes a time , thief , when the jewels cease to sparkle , when the gold loses its luster , when the throne room becomes a prison , and all that is left ... is a father' s love for his child .
to the hell fires with thulsa doom .
he' s evil , a sorcerer who can summon demons .
his followers ' only purpose is to die in his service .
there are thousands of them .
this mountain of power where he lives is said to be impregnable .
i have talked to subotai and he agrees .
let' s take what we have while we live .
i have never had so much as now .
all my life i' ve been alone .
many times i face my death with no one to know .
i would look into the huts and the tents of others in the coldest dark ... and i would see figures holding each other in the night .
but i always passed by .
you and i ... we have warmth .
that' s so hard to find in this world .
please , let someone else pass by in the night .
let us take the world by the throat ... and make it give us what we desire .
the children of doom .
doom' s children .
they told my lord the way to the mountain of power .
they told him to throw down his sword ... and return to the earth .
hah !
time enough for the earth in the grave .
ohhh !
once great men lived here .
giants , gods .
once , but long ago .
it was here that lmet my master .
it was no accident .
noris it mere chance ... that lam the teller of his tale .
hey !
i' m a wizard , mind you .
this place is kept by powerful gods ... and spirits of kings .
harm my flesh , and you will have to deal with the dead .
can you summon demons , wizard ?
yes !
lf i strike at you , i would summon the demon ... more ferocious than all in hell !
the mounds have been here since the time of the titans .
kings buried in them .
great kings .
domains once glittered like the light on a windy sea .
fire won' t burn there .
no fire at all .
that' s why i live down here in the wind .
do you care for these places ?
i sing to them .
on nights when they wish ...
i sing of the tales of battles , heroes , witches and women .
nobody bothers me down here .
not even ...
thulsa doom .
do flowers grow around here ?
flowers ?
flowers .
you' ve not come here as a pilgrim , have you ?
oil the sword and feed the horse .
have you ever ridden one of those things before ?
no !
warrior !
what are the flowers for ?
for a girl .
doom , doom , doom , doom
doom
doom
doom
where do you think you' re going , brother ?
i' m afraid .
afraid ?
to bare yourself ?
why ?
you' re so big and so well grown .
you should be proud of your body .
how do you expect to reach emptiness ... without knowing your own body ?
could we talk over there ... where the others do not see ?
why , yes , brother .
of course .
i' m afraid and i' m shy .
ls this , uh , your robe ?
a priest' s robe ?
yes , it' s all i have .
good .
that' s all you' il ever need .
brother .
what do you see ?
uh , infinity .
good .
i see you .
i have watched you .
for a thousand years i have watched you .
doom !
doom !
doom !
doom !
who among you still fears death ?
who will not face emptiness ?
lnfidel !
i wish to speak to you now .
where is the eye of the serpent ?
rexor says that you gave it to a girl .
probably for a mere night' s pleasure .
what a loss .
people have no grasp of what they do .
you broke into my house , stole my property , murdered my servants and my pets .
and that is what grieves me the most !
you killed my snake .
thorgen is beside himself with grief .
he raised that snake from the time it wasborn .
you killed my mother !
you killed my father !
you killed my people !
you took my father' s sword .
ah .
it must have been when i was younger .
there was a time , boy , when i searched for steel , when steel meant more to me than gold or jewels .
the riddle ... ofsteel .
yes .
you know what it is , don' t you , boy ?
shall i tellyou ?
it' s the least i can do .
steel isn' t strong , boy .
flesh is stronger .
look around you , here .
there , on the rocks .
that beautiful girl .
come to me , my child .
that is strength , boy .
that is power .
the strength and power of flesh .
what is steel compared to the hand that wields it ?
lookat the strength of your body , the desire in your heart .
i gave you this .
such a waste .
contemplate this on the tree ofwoe .
crucify him .
he said you were a wizard .
do the gods owe you any favors ?
yeah .
there are dangers .
but i see you care little for those .
the spirits of this place extract a heavy toll .
then i will pay them .
drink .
drink .
sometime soon , perhaps tonight ... they' il try to take him , and if they succeed
lf they succeed , you' il follow .
no !
no !
stop !
stop !
stop !
no !
stop !
stop !
they' re gone !
they' re gone !
all the gods , they cannot sever us .
lf i were dead , and you were still fighting for life , i' d come back for you .
back from the pit of hell to fight at your side .
the old man says the mountain of power is hollow .
thulsa doom lives in the mountain .
what else does he say ?
that in the back of the mountain there' s a gorge .
many caves .
good thief could get in there .
steal the princess .
be off before she' s missed in the darkness .
good thieves could do that , but not vengeful ones .
only thegirl .
we kill thulsa doom another day .
agreed ?
conan ?
so this is paradise .
princess .
yee aah !
uuh !
yee uuh !
get them !
come on !
you .
yee ah !
help him .
lnfidel defilers .
they should all drown in lakes of blood .
now they will know why they are afraid of the dark .
now they will learn why they fear the night .
seek .
uuh !
the wizard i told him i would pay the gods .
hold me .
kiss me .
kiss me .
let me breathe my last breath into your mouth .
i' m so cold .
so cold .
keep ... me ... warm .
keep ...
me ... warm .
hey .
fire won' t burn up there .
no fire at all .
why do you cry ?
he is conan .
cimmerian .
he won' t cry ... so i cry for him .
he will kill you !
he has seen your fires .
he will come for me , and when he does he will kill you !
i remember days like this , when my father took me to the forest ... and we ate wild blueberries .
more than 20 years ago .
i was just a boy of four or five .
the leaves were so dark and green then .
the grass smelled sweet with the spring wind .
almost 20 years of pitiless combat !
no rest !
no sleep like other men !
and yet the spring wind blows , subotai .
have you ever felt such a wind ?
they blow where i live too .
ln the north of every man' s heart .
it' s never too late , subotai .
no !
it would only lead me back here another day .
ln even worse company .
for us there is no spring just the wind that smells fresh before the storm .
hey , old man .
where' d you get this stuff ?
the dead .
our gods are pleased with you .
they will watch the battle .
heh !
are they going to help ?
no .
well , then tell them to stay out of the way !
crom .
i' ve never prayed to you before .
i have no tongue for it .
no one , not even you will remember ... if we were good men or bad .
why we fought or why we died .
no .
all that matters is that two stood against many .
that' s what' s important .
valor pleases you , crom , sogrant me one request .
grant me revenge .
and if you do not listen , then the hell with you !
aghh !
hey ya !
heh !
yah !
yee ee ee ah !
aaah !
yaah !
yaah !
aaa aaa aah !
that' s how we do it !
i did it with my spear !
aha !
do you want to live forever ?
doom !
don' t leave me !
my lord !
no , don' t kill me !
father !
aaah !
ah !
yuck !
ecch !
doom !
doom !
purging is at last at hand .
day of doom is here .
all that is evil : all their allies .
your parents , your leaders : those who would call them selves your judges .
those who have lied ... and corrupted the earth .
they shall all be cleansed .
doom !
you , my children , are the water ... that will wash away all that hasgone before .
ln your hand you hold my light .
the gleam in the eye of set .
this flame will burn away the darkness ; burn you the way to paradise !
doom !
doom !
my child .
you have come to me , my son .
for who now is your father if it is not me ?
who gave you the will to live ?
i am the well spring from which you flow .
when i am gone , you will have never been .
what will your world be without me ...
my son ?
