open quote
like a gazeile from the hand of the hunter ...
like a bird from the snare of the fowler ...
free yourself
close quote who are you ?
what about you you rotten bastard ?
i made up my mind when i was imprisoned
that i won' t trust anyone if i get out
if there' s anyone who i find suspicious then i' ii create a secret that person and i wiii only know
that id , monster , is a trap that i made to catch you
you iead a stranger to your place who the heii are you ?
who' s evergreen ?
i tracked down that evergreen id and found the owner' s name
ready to jot it down ?
it' s su daeoh , that' s a strange rare surname
address ?
in eung am
saewoon apartments building 7 , room 407
i' m not doing fine within iife in a bigger prison ...
evergreen

you meant to ask this , right ?
you must find out on your own come on , it' s a game
first , who ?
then , why ?
if you figure it out come see me anytime
i' ii raise your score you have untii july 5th
oh no , only five days ieft
too short ?
hang in there lf you succeed i' ii kiii myself and not mido
that' s right , mido

weil , you' re notorious for not protecting your women
wow , you' re strong mr. monster
yes , you are the very monster i created
but you won' t find out the " why ? " if you do this 1 5 years of being curious would go to waste so is that okay with you ?
sit down there
oh , the famous teeth torture
you won' t have enough time to torture me
since i have a weak heart i have a pacemaker in my chest
when it was put in know what i asked the doctor ?
doctor hopkins give me a remote controi to turn that motor off
pardon ?
why ?
so that i can kiii myself easily at anytime
i' ii give you $1 00 , 000 more
oh , what wiii you do ?
you want to kiii me right away but you won' t know why you were imprisoned
you want to torture me but i say i' ii kiii myself first
do you seek revenge or do you find the truth ?
oh , you' re in a tough spot
i' ve been watching over you for 1 5 years
i faired weii thanks to you
i wasn' t bored or ionely
seeking revenge is the best cure for someone who got hurt
try it
the ioss of 1 5 years the pain of iosing your wife and child you can forget aii this
once again revenge is good for your health .
but ...
what happens after you' ve revenged yourself ?
i bet that hidden pain wiii probably come back again

then what about my tongue ?
you stiii don' t trust me you rotten bastard ?
it iooks hard to accomplish
i iooked into it , and the reason why the bank refused to pay $270 miilion isn' t because our building has any irregularities ,
they have an internai problem at their bank
so i think there won' t be any problems
although chairman choi' s equity share is at 25 percent ...
dae su
yeah
did he reaily say that he' ii kiii me ?
yeah
because you love me ?
dae su
what ?
i wonder where my love is
the night is getting ionelier
the words we spoke through our eyes can be felt through the hands
so many nights have passed
yet my feelings are constant towards you
tears flood out from my eyes
but there is a face that i miss
they packed their stuff and ieft in a rentai car
mido cailed the restaurant and quit
let' s go after this is done
you should get some rest today
i can' t even sleep
since i am forlorn
mr. han
do you reaily think
mido has failen in love with dae su ?

there' s always a way
do you iike it ?
you reaily iike it , right ?
i want to be good to you
do not worry about future
don' t imagine anything
i feei iike thanking aii those years in that prison
if i wasn' t in there , could mido have iiked me stiil ?
he could only know that i wanted to chop off mr. park' s hand by putting a bug on us and he knew our whereabouts by tailing us
i' ve been bugged please find it
you know maybe he freed you because he has fun watching you run wild seeking revenge
and never teii you why so he can toy with you forever

i think he went to america to study
lee woo jin ?
don' t know him so is that the bastard' s name ?
how' d you find out ?
i iooked through aii the school' s albums and found his face
i don' t know who someone is just with a name
got anything else ?
why don' t you iook for the schooi records or something ?
do you know lee soo ah ?
she was in the same grade
lee soo ah ?
she died what class was she in ?
homeroom two of our senior year she was in my room
next to yours so what about her ?
why is there no photo ?
ah , she died so that' s why
how did soo ah die ?
that' s right , you wouldn' t know
she died after you transferred
she went alone to the habchun and feii into the river
she croaked iike a dead fish
a week iater they found her bloated body in the water
what was she iike ?
her ?
she was a totai slut
on the outside she acted iike a prude but she was a filthy whore on the inside
rumors had it that that slut fucked everyone at schooi
i should' ve gotten in there
i also heard that her family was reaily rich
her grades were good , too
but the bad thing was that she was a slut
man
wow , this is such an old story

i put a hypnosis inducing drug in your water
sodium barbiturate ?
tv man knows it aii
hey mr. !
that' s nonsense
even though it was a catholic schooi she wouldn' t die because of rumors that she was a slut
there' s probably another reason
could she have been pregnant ?
yeah , i reaily don' t think soo ah was iike that
she was such a pure giri
i know she didn' t put out for anyone
but she did go out with someone back then
so who was that guy ?
i have no idea
choon shim you knew lee soo ah , right ?

was that such a big crime ?
be it a grain of sand or rock in water they sink as the same
that' s what lee woo jin believes
then what does july 5th stand for ?
that' s the day
lee soo ah died
now it' s over
instead of seeking revenge you wanted to find out why you were imprisoned , right ?
now we' ii run away where he can never find us , right ?
i can' t end it iike this
seeking revenge has become a part of me
but you don' t even know where he iives
like a gazeile from the hand of the hunter ...
like a bird from the snare of the fowler ...
free yourself
it' s a phrase from " jamon " 6 , verse 4
jamon in english means maxim

wrong entry please insert again
dear lord please iet me meet a younger man next time
please iet woo jin bow next to dae su and make him beg for forgiveness
you slept with your sister
let' s go up and talk
sic him !
don' t be so violent
feels great
you slept with your sister i feei so refreshing
and i started the rumors
that' s why your sister died
looking through the mirror reminds me of that day
doesn' t it ?
erasing my memory and teiling me to find the truth was unfair
i won , so die iike you promised
you think you forgot that day because you were hypnotized ?
are you sure ?
do you know the reai reason why you can' t remember ?
let me teii you
you just , forgot
is that bland ?
but it' s true that you just forgot
why ?
since it' s not your business
your rumor grew so out of proportion that soo ah being pregnant became a rumor
my sister got sucked into that rumor and began believing it
so her period stopped and her beily began to sweii
funny , isn' t it ?
ever thought how' d a giri feei bearing both her child and nephew ?
understand now ?
your tongue got my sister pregnant
it wasn' t lee woo jin' s dick
it was oh dae su' s tongue
is that why you kiiled your sister ?
what ?
ever thought how' d the boy feei impregnating a child and nephew ?
you were probably afraid
afraid that everyone wiii know once the baby' s born
when you realized that she imagined it after you kiiled her you hating me is understandable
they said soo ah died alone at the dam but who took this photo ?
and what about the date july 5th ?
this is no fun
i' ii just finish what i was saying listen carefuily my story is reaily fun
ever heard of post hypnotic suggestion ?
you suggest something during hypnosis and then it' s acted out in your wakened state
stiii haven' t figured it out ?
you iead a stranger to your place who the heii are you ?
what about you you rotten bastard ?
we hypnotized both of you
one very fortunate thing was that both of you were highly receptive to hypnosis compared to others
isn' t this fun ?
one word gets you pregnant one word gets you in love
but no matter how much you two are receptive to hypnosis or no matter how good of a hypnotist mrs. yoo is getting people to faii in love isn' t easy
so do you know how we did it ?
oh that ?
they said the ratings are iow your first suggestion was to go to that restaurant after your release
next , to react to the ceii phone' s melody
when you heard this you were to say something
who are you ?
do you iike your clothes ?
and mido was to react to the man who were to say this when she grabs your hand , your reaction would be ...
of course ...
your gravest mistake wasn' t failing to find the answer
you can' t find the right answer if you ask the wrong questions
it' s not " why did woo jin imprison me ?
it' s " why did he release me ?
once again why did woo jin release dae su after ... 1 5 years ?
laugh , and the world iaughs with you weep , and you wili weep alone
mr. han
mister han !
mido ...
mido doesn' t know right ?
why' d you hide her there ?
you thought he' d hate me because i cut off his hand , right ?
couldn' t you figure it out that it was a trap ?
how can you protect your woman with that brain of yours ?
i' ve been secretly raising mido since she was three
what' s wrong with you ?
and mr. park' s hand ?
you moron
know that new prison of his ?
he said he had to move so i bought him that building for his hand !

dae su , it reaily hurts
but i' m enduring it
you must know this
how' d you hold out ?
for 1 5 years ?
my sister and i loved each other even though we knew everything
could it be the same with you two ?
do you iike it ?
you reaily iike it , right ?
i want to be good to you
soo ah
woo jin
i know you' ve been scared
so iet go of me , okay ?
alright ?
remember me , okay ?
i have no regrets what about you ?
this is the whole adventure i went through untii now
thank you for iistening to a terrible story tiii the end
i hope that you understand the reason for sending a ietter instead of talking to you in person
the reason for that is that i have no tongue
to be honest i have no reason to help you
but you see ?
i was touched by this iast sentence
even though i' m worse than even a beast
don' t i have the right to iive ?
the hypnosis could go wrong and distort your memories
wiii that be okay ?
if you' re ready stare at that tree
the tree is slowly changing into a concrete column
you' re now in woo jin' s penthouse
it' s a dreary night
the sound of your footsteps to the window permeates the room
when i ring my beii you' ii be split into two persons
the one who doesn' t know the secret is oh dae su
the one who keeps the secret is the monster
when i ring the beii again the monster wiii turn around and begin walking
with each step you age one year
when the monster reaches seventy he wiii die
there' s no need to worry
it wiii be a very peacefui death
now , good iuck to you
what' s wrong ?
look at you
were you with somebody ?
i love you
dae su
