going somewhere , solo ?
it' s too late .
you should have paid him when you had the chance .
jabba' s put a price on your head so large ... every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you .
i' m lucky i found you first .
if you give it to me , i might forget i found you .
jabba' s through with you .
he has no time for smugglers ... who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser .
you can tell that to jabba .
he may only take your ship .
that' s the idea .
i' ve been looking forward to this for a long time .
solo !
come out of there , solo !
have you now .
han , my boy , you disappoint me .
why haven' t you paid me ... and why did you fry poor greedo ?
han , i can' t make exceptions .
what if everyone who smuggled for me ... dropped their cargo at the first sign ... of an imperial starship ?
it' s not good business .
han , my boy , you' re the best .
so , for an extra 20 % ...
okay , 15 % .
but if you fail me again ...
i' il put a price on your head so big ... you won' t be able to go near a civilized system .
come on !
