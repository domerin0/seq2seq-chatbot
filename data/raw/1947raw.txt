i' il take of my shoe and crush your bonce !
they want to mess up my life , prick my brain with injections .
i' m not mad to accept that .
they order me to eat powders , to swallow electric bulbs .
they' ve bind my soul and lead it like a bear .
i am not bozana the she bear .
they want my wings .
what will my spirit do without wings ?
my spirit flies .
she cries , sings or laughs , when she wants to .
when god lived down here , he couldn' t get along with us gypsies , so he had to go up there .
it' s not my fault .
playing
propagate , procreate .
god help me .
you would beat me even if you threw them the wrong way .
everything i earned has gone .
if only i had a person in front of me , i wouldn' t be sorry about it .
but no , he' s a swine .
he takes and he smiles .
god , what have i done to you ?
i' il give it all .
i' il even sell my house if i need to .
just as long as i beat him .
i' il work for 20 years , if that' s my destiny .
my fate will change , and i' il have more luck .
if you would help me once more , god .
did you get drunk ?
do you want to ruin my wedding ?

what should i do now ?
music
directed by
god , for once , help me .
the house will be white like milk .
i must tidy up my house , so my leg sees a white god .

thank you for healing my husband .
take the turkey for luck .
i don' t charge for healing .
a little more , a little more .
eat .
don' t cry daca , i beg you .
perhan , look what i' ve brought you .
is it mine ?
only yours .
you obey me .
you' re grandma' s sweetheart .
mine alone ?
yours !
you' re a good person , you work , you take care of your sister .
danira , look .
i' il give you my soul if you' re a good boy .
whose bird is this ?
perhan' s .
he works .
you give everything you get to perhan .
he' s a good boy .
you give perhan everything , but nothing to me .
i' m not a war criminal !
don' t you see ?
don' t act stupid .
i' il lose my mind .
perhanu this , perhanu that !
eveything only to perhan !
you and your perhan can live in yugoslavia , i' m going to germany .
i' m leaving !
get it ?
go away !
what have you done to me ?
you' ve disgraced me !
why are you beating me ?
don' t curse me , mother !
woman , where is that actor of yours ?
look , what he did to my daughter .
do you have any problems , old woman ?
i' il put out his eyes !
i' il kill him !
don' t push me away , old woman .
where is your son ?
call him immediately .
call him !
sit , calm down .
i won' t sit .
i want you to call your son .

you chat a lot .
he pumped up my daughter , and she' s not even 11 years old .
find him at once !
he disgraced her .
why did you come to me ?
i' il pull out your eyes !
call your son at once !
he ruined my daughter .
i' il kill you .
me ?
look at you , what a disgrace !
stop it .
and you ?
you felt nice , when you lied under him .
i know your tricks .
you want money .
you have to pay because your son fucks anything that moves .
my brothers will castrate him .
sit down .
ok , i' il sit down .
there .
i sit .
call your son .
let him say , if he' il marry her .
if he wants her , you can do nothing about it .
when she sees my son her eyes are like blinkers .
don' t tell me !
she just winks , gives herself to others .
blinkers ?
shame on you , old woman .
winged , sunny bird .
what trouble brought you here , child ?
worse then trouble .
ruza turned the house upside down .
she wants everything to glare on holiday .
perhan , give the girl some special lime !
do you hear me ?
i' ve come to buy soome lime .
go , run !
sit down .
who' il carry such a sack ?
i will , if you' il help me .
do you know how to make lime ?
listen .
the most important thing is temperature .
without constant fire you cannot burn lime .
fire is the basis of everything .
wood burns , smoke goes through the oven , the air warms up , iron plate gets white hot .
limetone burns and then goes out .
in the end everything turns to white dust .
only god knows , how much is heat is needed for it .
do you know how to kiss ?
no house would be white without lime , plum jam would be sour .
do you know how to kiss ?
grandma thinks , that lime was the breast of the rocky mother .
mother of the forest and mother of the rock had a quarrel .
the forest mother tore her breast off with her teeth .
that' s why lime is white as milk .
the earth gave it birth , the water baptised it , the fire breast fed it .
you don' t know how to kiss .
i know , in a film way .
like richard gere .
at dawn we' il be in mexico .
at dawn ?
is it hot in mexico ?
it' s hot .
it' il be wonderful .
you , me , muchachos .
calm down .
how long can you kiss without breathing in ?
fifteen or twenty minutes .
no !
my god !
you' ve got magnet on your lips .
shall i show you something ?
look at the can .
fata morgana !
stop , the can !
stop !
you' ve come to propose her ?
me .
what ?
you' re proposing ?
this brat has come to spoil our vasilica !
look at him !
inside !
azra , stay here .
what ?
i said inside the house !
azra , stay here !
inside , if i tell you !
are you deaf ?
you' ve ruined my life .
what' s up with you ?
you' ve swallowed up my soul .
and you !
you army bastard !
one doesn' t know what faith you belong to !
neither gypsy nor non gypsy .
you haven' t got a single penny in your pocket !
you army bastard !
what are you waiting for , get lost !
and you ?
you' re silent as a grave !
you don' t even open your mouth , you asshole !
you' ve turned into a grave !
my god !
has anybody seen anything like it ?
help me neighbours !
he wants to kill me !
help !
he' il kill me !
i' il pull out your eyes !
help !
is anybody there ?
hurry , neighbours !
he wants to slaughter me !
dear grandma !
161 00 : 16 : 35, 007 > 00 : 16 : 37, 526
in a world , that does not understand me , there is no place for me .
when i finish writing this lettes , i' il swallow it .
i don' t want anybody to find it , because i would be later ashamed , of killing myself because for a woman .
i cannot live a second more without azra .
her mother , the three headed snake , does not allow me to see her .
yours , perhan .
my name is not zabit , if i don' t jump over the shadow !
one , two , three , now !
damned shadow !
the moonlight smiles .
azra !
around fire we snivel , cry rises , my shadow shivers , laughter lowers .
what is this pet doing at this hour ?
azra !
i love you !
i' m going !
who are you , politician , to hang yourself ?

fool !
if you were my son , i would kill you this moment ! .
here , the accordion .

it' s absolutely romantic outside .

why wouldn' t you dance with such a handsome man ?
how do you like it ?
absolutely romantic !
you' il burn me !
grandma , are you sleeping ?
i' m sleeping .

grandma , sit down by my side .
was my mother beautiful ?
like a mountain fairy .
when she gave birth to daca , her belly stretched .
i went to a witch .
she said , that she came upon a a water devil .
she gave her some spells , but nothing helped .
i took her to a hodja .
germany is my homeland .
merdzan , why didn' t your return there ?
he said she betrayed the path of the ancestors .
he read to her from the koran on his head .
to no purpose .
the doctor gave her the medicines and injections , but to no avail .
she died in my hands .
she was young .
god gave , god took .
what can i do .
daca' s father is not my father ?
no .
your father is a slovenian .
he was here in the army .
he promised your mother heaven on earth , but then he left .
then i' m an army bastard .
ruza told the truth .
let her eat shit !
you are grandmas child .

go back , we' re not going together today .
sit there and take care of daca .
are you deaf ?

even my grandma agreed .
you' ve come to propose her ?
i said , i will not give her away .

once there was the sky and earth husband and wife .
they had five children : sun , moon , fire , fog and wing .
they built a wonderful city and settled them there .
the bantering sun wanted to separate the earth from the sky , but it didn' t succeed .
others have tried as well , but with no avail .
when wind rushed at them with all its power , the earth separated from the sky .
hatidza !

no matter the price !
blood is the biggest secret .

that' s what the lawyer said , that acuired the passport for you .
there' s a big confusion .
it' s being reported in newspapers , on radio , tv .
they' ve made a movie about people , that sell children abroad .
don' t go there , please .

i' ve come as it befits .
oh my .
billions !
i don' t have to kiss hands .

look at him the big businessman .
how did you earn that much money ?
he came so he would trick my daughter with the money .
look !
did she get married ?
no .
what can i do .
woman like woman .
she did what she decided .
i don' t know how to deal with her .
i wonder myself .
what should i do with her ?
i don' t know myself !
and the child she bears ?
it' s supposably yours .
what do you think ?
ask your uncle .
god , what are you doing to me ?
a black train has come mother .
it has come , mother , a black morning .
neighbour , there is no sense in drinking that much .
i also drank brandy , but it doesn' t help .

mine is fine .
what' s with yours ?
where did you leave your sister ?
in ljubljana .
she should return back soon .
bring me a glass of brandy .
you take the chair and sit down .
why does your wife cry ?
the bitch has to let out water , and she releases it through her eyes .
why do you trust your mother in law more then your wife ?
since i' ve got myself lying ,
i don' t trust noone anymore .
if you don' t trust at all , god will abandon you .
where did you get this ?
where did you get these clothes ?
i' ve earned it with these ten fingers .
i will build a house with them as well .
who will live in this house ?
you and me , grandma .
i will not live in this house .
my spirit doesn' t want to .
god forbid , that you would live in this house .
don' t speak like that .
what have you become .
you were honest once .
now you changed for the worse .
what am i like , grandma ?
you' ve broken my heart .
you' ve spoilt entirely .
let me tell you something son .
all this is a fata morgana .
you gave me money .
i may die tomorrow .
who will return you ?
take the money back .
you' ve burnt your hand !
you know how that hurts .
you' re doing yourself evil things .
stop playing !
you' re playing madness .
you' il kill a man .
back !
perhan , wait for me .
neighbour , you' re blind drunk !
what are you looking at ?
get in !
my neighbour is my concern .
chandelier !
scales !
cooker !
this present is from a wedding witness .
let' s see what' s inside .
a bit of silence , please .
bread !
money !
gold !
a limuosine is coming .
the chauffeur is opening the door .
the bride is stepping out .
the groom is carrying her in his arms .
mother in law is offering the daughter in law bread and sugar , so she would have a sweet life .
be happy .
the groom kisses the bride .
mother in law leads daughter in law into the house .
the groom is being beaten to obtain power .
he' il need it .
grandma and her grandson will now dance .
how beautiful he is , how elegant , wise , civilized and pedantic !
grandma' s grandson .
my living monument .
get up , come with me .
you and ruza must help me .
find some cripples to go begging and a pregnant woman with the same fate , as mine has .
here' s your advance .
we' il find some cripples .
and how do you intend to sell your own child ?
you will meet with a terrible accident .
first , the child is not mine .
i will bring up no bastard .
and second , i won' t repeat .
only under these conditions will i marry her .
go out so they won' t see us .
are you building another house here ?
if we built it you would see it .
a house is not a needle .
if there is a god , the kids will go into the world , to work and earn money .
they just musn' t disgrace themselves .
let them build a house like other people , with their own labor by the sweat of their face .
i am already old .
i can' t work anymore .
why not ?
they' re still young .
you know we burn lime .
merdzan doesn' t want to work .
may i come to you ?
not even dead .
did you understand ?
i can hardly wait that perhan , my sweetheart , returns .
i can hardly wait that he gets a child .
so that this wish of mine turns true as well .
do with me whatever you want .
but why ?
you know well why .
don' t foist me a magpie instead of a gosling .
this child is diligent , obedient , qualified .
i' m sorry for speaking about this .
something is pressing me in my soul , so words are like a cure .
my son comes at midnight , the house is for him like an inn .
he eats and goes to the whores .
i don' t know what' s wrong with him .
my golden one , perhan , is the best person in this world .
he' s not like my son , bastard .
if you knew what kind of daughter i had .
his mother was a beauty .
he looks just like her .
she died young .
i fell ill because of her .
what should i tell you ?
are you alive ?
i' m alive .
here , eat .
perhan , you must believe me .
the child is ours .
merdzan assaulted me when i was three months pregnant .
don' t lie .
shut up , don' t lie .
i' m not lying .
i don' t want to bring up a bastard !
i will sell him .
then will make our own child .
give me your hand .
this one is ours too .
believe yourself , if you don' t believe me .
i concieved when we slept together on st. george' s day .
i' ve calculated everything .
i swear by my life .
i know he' s a bastard .
we' il make our own .
i said what i said .
why ?
this one is ours too .
wait .
something in me has turned upside down .
i dreamt that you gave birth to a white bird .
when i came near .
wait .
what do you want ?
you' ve done everything well .
but where is a wife for me ?
couldn' t you find her ?
where is my house ?
why did you lie about building a house for me ?
were you at home ?
from where would i bring my wife then ?
i thought .
what did you think ?
that you picked up one on the way .
what do i know .
you know , ahmed .
you know everything .
why did you lie to me ?
sadam lied to me !
i gave him the money for your house .
he put it into his own pocket .
he came yesterday to laugh in my face .
i' m sorry , i' m not responsible for your house .
i swear by my child .
believe me .
if you don' t want to , go .
leave me alone .
may i die .
i will give you half of my house .
here are the papers .
i will call the lawyer tomorrow so they will certify it in court .
i may not be much long .
and robert ?
i loved him more then life .
and now ?
i don' t know .
i obsere him every day and everything seems suspicious to me .
the eyes , the nose , hands .
he doesn' t look like me in any way .
we' re brothers in that way as well the wives cheated on us both .
boy !
look , perhan !
a boy !
let us not bewitch him .
azra !
no , azra .
i ask you like god , don' t leave me !
i love you !
azra !
god is nevertheless a blind cat .
he looked at me while i was hiding treasure in the canal .
he tied my sould with a rope and let the flood wash away the gold and money .
first he gave me wealth , in the end with the treasure he took my soul as well .
i had so much gold , dear hatidza , that i could build a house out of gold coins . and cover the roof with them .
we could build a big house , we could touch the moon from its roof .
a cruel fate has come upon me .
the more i rack my brain about where it came from , the bigger is the earthquake in my head and the more i go away from the truth .
maybe you have also put a spell on me , grandma tidza when i told you that i don' t trust anyone anymore , when i caught myself lying .
if you don' t trust at all , god will abandon you .
you won' t be good nor to god nor to people .
you know , i am not like that good to people , but i was deceived by a man , whom i trusted more then god .
ahmed was both god and father for me .
i wrote to you that daca stayed at the hospital .
even your own eyes can decieve yourself .
if i could , i would put out my eyes and get blind .
only later i have realised , what a trap ahmed set me up .
where is he ?
he ran away .
where ?
who knows .
he drove me away and found himself another woman .
dzamila , talk , if you know .
he has reconciled with his brothers .
they united the slaves and disappeared .
did you take my sister from ljubljana ?
where ?
speak , i' il kill you !
leave him alone , you fool !
to rome .
may god give you luck .
help the poor girl .
did you see this girl ?
no , i don' t know her .
fuck you !
fuck you , asshole !
you said i shouldn' t return home without danira .
i travelled the whole world from end to end .
ahmed as though as he would turn into a mole , and danira is nowhere to be seen .
i' ve been looking for ahmed for three years .
i' d like to live 300 years , just to find him and pull out his heart .
i' ve been searching for her for days .
this has made me turn into wind , my dreams have evaporated like dust .
i can' t dream anymore .
a gypsy without dreams is like a church without a roof ,
like a textbook without letters .
yours , perhan .
danira !
perhan !
brother !
god !
as long as i have found you !
and your leg ?
does it hurt ?
same .
oh my .
you know what happened ?
what ?
he said that the hospitals in italy are better .
that they will admit us here .
that you and i will be together .
since then i have been begging .
he have traviled over 101 cities .
today he' s getting married .
ahmed ?
yes .
and you have a son .
he' s just like you .
they' re waiting that he grows up , so they can sell him .
perhan !
what is it ?
what' s your name ?
perhan .
and yours ?
perhan .
don' t lie !
why are you lying ?
hurry up , please .
go , they will see us ..
this is your father .
give him your hand .
wait for me here .
i' il be right back .
don' t go anywhere , please .
i must buy a gift for grandma .
come back soon .

don' t forget about my accordion .
don' t worry .
if i' m late , i will catch up with you on the next stattion .
take it .
what' s wrong ?
i' m sad .
don' t be .
let ' wave to him .
daddy !
perhan , stop !
i am angry with you .

let me be damned , if i don' t return .

look at him , ahmed .
where are you , perhan , my child ?
i' ve come to you .
i' il serve you till i die .
you are my father .
you and god .
accept me or kill me .
why would i kill you , you poor fellow ?
kill me , sinful thoughts have come to my mind .
give him food to eat .
look how thin he is .
who is this ?
some fool , a poor man .
eat the cake !
die in shit !
hurry up .
quick , to the bridge .
i will kill you for preventing my marriage !
run .
you' ve ruined my youth , and i' il destroy your head .
let it be , what shall be .
i will catch up with you , even if you were a bird .
for fuck sake !
oh , god !
god , what have you done ?
you have turned as though the whole world has turned .
merdzan will lift you up again , but you must help me .
if you can' t , i' il lift you up myself .
did you see perhan ?
why ?
he left you without a father and mother , but he washed your feet .
he didn' t know how to call you .
you let him among the wolves .
lead him where you think is the best place in that world .
do you see these two dices ?
let them fall , for once let them fall , as i wish .
my wish would come true .
and may i not be merdzan anymore , if i don' t fulfill your wish .
and throw the dices like they should be .
