christmas comes but once a year
for every girl and boy
the laughter and the joy
they find in each new toy
i' il tell you of a little boy
who lives across the way
this little fella ' s christmas
is just another day
it was just before dawn
one miserable morning
in black ' 44
when the forward commander was told to sit tight
when he asked that his men be withdrawn
and the generals gave thanks
as the other ranks
held back the enemy tanks
for a while
and the anzio bridgehead
was held for the price
of a few hundred ordinary lives
he' s the little boy
that santa claus forgot
and goodness knows
he didn ' t want a lot
he sent a note to santa
for some soldiers and a drum
it broke his little heart
when he found santa hadn' t come
in the street he envies
all those lucky boys
so ya thought ya
might like to
go to the show
to feel the warm thrill of confusion
that space cadet glow
tell me , is something eluding you , sunshine
is this not what you expected to see
if you wanna find out what' s behind these cold eyes
you' il just have to claw your way through this disguise
mama loves her baby
and daddy loves you too
and the sea may look warm to you , babe
and the sky may look blue
ooh , ooh , ooh
ooh , babe
ooh , ooh , ooh
baby blue
ooh , ooh , ooh
ooh , ooh , babe
if you should go skating
on the thin ice of modern life
dragging behind you
the silent reproach
of a million tear stained eyes
don ' t be surprised
when a crack in the ice
appears under your feet
you slip out of your depth and out of your mind
with you fear flowing out behind you
as you claw the thin ice
daddy' s flown across the ocean
leaving just a memory
a snapshot in the family album
daddy , what else did you leave for me
daddy , what' d ya leave behind for me
all in all it was
just a brick in the wall
all in all it was all just bricks in the wall
easy .
be careful .
what ?
will you put me on there ?
well , where' s your mother , then ?
she' s gone to the shops .
yes , all right .
how' s that then ?
enjoying it ?
lovely , lovely .
now off you go .
go on .
now what have i told you about this ?
what have i told you ?
go on , go on now .
sling your hook .
go on .
sling your hook .
and kind old king george
sent mother a note
when he heard that father was gone
it was , i recall
in the form of a scroll
gold leaf and all
and i found it one day
in a drawer of old photographs
hidden away
and my eyes still grow damp to remember
his majesty signed
with his own rubber stamp
it was dark all around
there was frost in the ground
when the tigers broke free
and no one survived
from the royal fusiliers company c
they were all left behind
most of them dead
the rest of them dying
and that' s how the high command
took my daddy from me
did you see the frightened ones
did you hear the falling bombs
did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter
when the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue sky
did you see the frightened ones
did you hear the falling bombs
the flames are all long gone but the pain lingers on
good bye
blue sky
good bye , blue sky
good bye
good bye

when we grew up and went to school
there were certain teachers who would hurt the children anyway they could
by pouring their derision upon anything we did
exposing every weakness
however carefully hidden by the kids
what have we here , laddie ?
mysterious scribblings ?
a secret code ?
no .
poems , no less .
poems , everybody !
the lad here reckons himself a poet .
money , get back .

new car , caviar , four star daydream .

absolute rubbish , laddie !
get on with your work .
an acre is the area of a rectangle ... whose length is one furlong ... and whose width is one chain .
but in this town it was well known
when they got home at night their fat and psychopathic wives
would thrash them within inches of their lives
we don ' t need no education
we don' t need no thought control
no dark sarcasm in the classroom
teacher , leave them kids alone
hey , teacher , leave them kids alone
all in all it' s just another brick in the wall
wrong !

all in all you' re just another brick in the wall
we don ' t need no education
if you don' t eat your meat , you can' t have any pudding !
we don' t need no thought control
how can you have any pudding if you don' t eat your meat ?
no dark sarcasm in the classroom
you !
yes , you , laddie !
poems , everybody .
the lad here reckons himself a poet .
teachers , leave them kids alone
hey , teacher , leave those kids alone
all in all you' re just another brick in the wall
all in all you' re just another brick in the wall
we don ' t need no education
no dark sarcasm in the classroom
again .
an acre is the area of a rectangle ... whose length is one furlong ... and whose width is one chain .

what shall we use
to fill
the empty spaces
where waves
of hunger
roar
shall we set out across
this sea
of faces
in search of more
and more applause
shall we buy a new guitar
shall we drive a more powerful car
shall we work straight through the night
shall we get into fights
leave the lights on drop bombs
do tours of the east contract diseases
bury bones break up homes
send flowers by phone
take to drink go to shrinks
give up meat rarely sleep
keep people as pets
train dogs race rats
fill the attic with cash
bury treasure store up leisure
but never relax at all
with our backs to the wall
i am just a new boy
a stranger in this town
where are all the good times
who ' s gonna show this stranger around
ooooh
i need a dirty woman
ooooh
i need a dirty girl

oh , wow , look at this tub !

what are you watching ?
hello ?
hello ?

day after day
love turns grey
like the skin of a dying man
and night after night
we pretend it' s all right
but i have grown older
and you have grown colder
and nothing is very much fun anymore
and i can feel
one of my turns coming on
i
feel
cold as a razor blade
tight as a tourniquet
dry as a funeral drum
run to the bedroom
in the suitcase on the left you' il find my favorite axe
don ' t look so frightened this is just a passing phase
one of my bad days
would you like to watch tv
or get between the sheets or contemplate the silent freeway
would you like something to eat
would you like to learn to fly
would ya would you like to see me try
would you like to call the cops
do you think it' s time i stopped next time , fuckers !
why are you running away
oooh , babe
don ' t leave me now
how could you go
when you know how i need you
to beat to a pulp on a saturday night
oh , babe
don ' t leave me now
how can you treat me this way
running away
ooh , babe
why are you running away
oooh , babe
oooh , babe
i don ' t need no arms around me
and i don' t need no drugs to calm me
i have seen the writing on the wall
don ' t think i need anything at all
no
don' t think i need anything at all
all and all it was all just bricks in the wall
all and all you were all just bricks in the wall
good bye , cruel world

to make me change my mind

i' ve got a little black book with my poems in
got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
when i' m a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
i got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
got those swollen hand blues
i' ve got 13 channels of shit on the tv to choose from
i' ve got electric light
and i' ve got second sight
i' ve got amazing powers of observation
and that is how i know
when i try to get through
on the telephone to you
there ' il be nobody home
i got the obligatory hendrix perm
and the inevitable pinhole burns
all down the front of my favorite satin shirt
i' ve got nicotine stains on my fingers
i' ve got a silver spoon on a chain
got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
i got wild staring eyes
and i got a strong urge to fly
but i got nowhere to fly to
oooh , babe
when i pick up the phone
there' s still nobody home
i' ve got a pair of gohills boots
and i got fading roots
does anybody here remember vera lynn

there is no pain you are receding
a distant ship smoke on the horizon
you are only coming through in waves
your lips move
but i can' t hear what you' re saying
when i was a child
i had a fever
my hands felt just like two balloons
now i' ve got that feeling once again
i can ' t explain you would not understand
this is not how i am
i
have become comfortably numb

there is no pain you are receding
a distant ship smoke on the horizon
you are only coming through in waves
your lips move
but i can' t hear what you' re saying
when i was a child
i caught a fleeting glimpse
out of the corner of my eye
i turned to look but it was gone
i cannot put my finger on it now
the child is grown the dream is gone
i
have become comfortably numb
so ya thought ya
might like to go to the show
to feel the warm thrill of confusion
that space cadet glow
i got some bad news for you , sunshine
pink isn ' t well he' s , uh , back at the hotel
and they sent us along as a surrogate band
now tonight , we ' re gonna find out where you fans really stand
are there any queers in the audience tonight

there' s one in the spotlight he don ' t look right
have him up against the wall against the wall
and that one looks jewish and that one' s a coon
who let all this riffraff into the room
there' s one smoking a joint
and that one' s got spots
if i had my way i' d have all of you shot
run , run , run , run
run , run , run , run
run , run , run , run
run , run , run , run
you better make your face up in your favorite disguise
with your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
with your empty smile and your hungry heart
feel the bile rising from your guilty past
with your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
and the hammers batter down your door
you better run run , run , run
run , run , run , run
run , run , run , run
run , run , run , run
you better run all day and run all night
keep your dirty feelings deep inside
and if you' re taking your girlfriend out tonight
you' d better park the car well out of sight
' cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
they' re gonna send you back to mother in a cardboard box
you better run
you cannot reach me now
no matter how you try
good bye , cruel world
it' s over
walk on by
waiting
to cut out the dead wood waiting
to weed out the weaklings waiting
to smash in their windows and kick in their doors
waiting for the final solution to strengthen the strain
waiting to follow the worms
would you like to see would you like to see
britannia rule again
my friend
all you need to do is follow the worms

the prisoner who now stands before you
was caught red handed showing feelings
showing feelings of an almost human nature

but my hands were tied
the bleeding hearts and artists

over the rainbow he is crazy
the evidence before the court is incontrovertible
there ' s no need for the jury to retire
in all my years of judging
i have never heard before
of someone more deserving
the full penalty of law
the way you made them suffer
your exquisite wife and mother
fills me with the urge to defecate
since , my friend you have revealed your deepest fear
i sentence you to be exposed
before your peers
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall

all alone
or in two' s
the ones who really love you
walk up and down
outside the wall
some hand in hand
some gathered together in bands
the bleeding hearts and the artists
make their stand
and when they' ve given you their all
some stagger and fall
after all , it' s not easy
banging your heart
against some mad bugger' s wall
when they' ve given you their all
some stagger and fall
after all , it' s not easy
