we will give you five minutes to leave this area .
who is the heavyweight champion of the world ?
... against those ropes .
if he stays there ...

he' s bad .
he' s in bad shape , man .
you better get your belt back
you smell like you done did somethin ' .

do it for the experience .
well , you know , i was gonna change her but ...
i remembered that i didn' t want to .
look at this .
joe frazier .
can' t even talk .
he can' t up no gate .
can' t fill no arena .
they got to let me fight .
fight .
if that happens , promise me you' il put some new people around you .
what you talkin ' about ?
where herbert and them when we need ' em ?
gene kilroy' s dropping off groceries like charity .
we borrow money from my folks .
they' re all over you when you got it , and then they just drop off you ... when you don' t .
norton , he' s big and strong , but he ain' t nothin ' .
hold on a second, joe .
they' re telling me we have a caller .
go ahead , please .
cosell , this is muhammad ali .
it' s muhammad ali .
everybody knows that i am the champ .
the crown is a lie .
i know it' s a lie .
joe frazier knows it' s a lie .
and it' s time for everybody to stop lying and tell the truth .
let' s tell it like it is .
with your court and boxing problems ... can you get a fight promoted ?
i would fightjoe frazier for free in a phone booth ... in the middle oftimes square if i wasn' t broke .
did you say you were broke ?
how can you be broke ?
you made more money than all previous heavyweights champions combined .
what about your management ?
surely they have provided for you .
all i' m trying to say is it' s time for everybody to stop lyin ' .
muhammad ali is the champ .
get my son herbert on the telephone .
muhammad , thank you for calling in .
i' il relay that tojoe .
and telljoe i said he is very ugly .
muhammad says that he will fight you anywhere , anytime ... and that the championship really is his until that battle ensues .
why didn' t you call an ambulance or a doctor ?
because he gave me your number when he checked in .
normally , he' s up there making a lot of noise .
but now he hasn' t answered the door in three days .
what' s that ?
it' s daylight .
get me that short dog .
give it to me .
what' s wrong with you ?
ain' t nothin ' wrong with me .
my head ain' t bad .
leave me alone .
leave you alone .
you called me !
yes , but that was a week ago .
why are you shamin ' yourself ?
let me go , man .
why you doin ' that to yourself ?
why you shamin ' yourself ?
ain' t nobody shamed .
ain' t nothin ' wrong with me .
i' m flyin ' .
the sky chief talk through me .
i know the word .
you know low .
yeah ?
i know low where the king is goin ' back to his throne !
from the root to the fruit !
them rhymes is old , bundini .
you need to get some new ones .
god don' t care about you .
don' t care about me .
in all of everything , we don' t mean nothin ' .
he don' t know us .
we be .
and that' s the onliest thing he did .
but that' s good .
that' s why we free .
but free ain' t easy .
free is real and real is a motherfucker .
it eats raw meat .
it walk in its own shoes .
it don' t ever waiver .
yeah .
l i sold your belt .
i sold your belt to a barber for $500 on lenox avenue .
that' s how low i did you .
i couldn' t help it .
i got a crazy mind .
that belt say you the heavyweight boxing champion of the world ... and i took that $500 ... and i put it in my arm .
that' s what i called to tell you .
i heard about the nation stuff , the courtroom .
what you gonna do ?
take me back .
i could go down there and get the belt .
i can go get the belt .
mr. ali has sporting blood .
mr. ali wants a place in this sports world .
he loves it too much .
i am therefore suspending mr. ali from the practice of islam .
he may no longer appear in temple , pray or teach ...
hey , champ .
$1, 000 to the man that bring me howard cosell' s toupee dead or alive !
don' t bother me .
i' m a world famous sportscaster ... and you' re an ex champion with diminished skills .
i can' t be seen with you .
how' s it goin ' , champ ?
pretty good , man .
muhammad , i' d do anything for you .
you know that .
but i' ve got bosses who only give a damn about nielsen ratings .
i guarantee ... it will be a historical and a momentous night .
if they came to me tomorrow and say , " we want you to fightjoe frazier .
madison square garden .
millions and millions of dollars .
here' s your license back .
i will tell them ...
i will never fight again .
frankly , muhammad , i' m surprised , because unless you or until you fight frazier
cosell , are you losin ' your hearing along with your hair ?
don' t put no question to it , man .
i done told you , i' m through fightin ' .
i got a much bigger contender , a much heavier opponent .
i' m fightin ' the entire us government .
do you think you' re going to jail ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
joe frazier told me on this show that he could knock you out .
see , there you go agitatin ' .
you should' ve asked smokin' joe what have he been smokin ' ?
that boy even dream he whupped me , he better wake up and apologize .
if i was to get in the ring with joe ... here' s what you might see .
ali comes out to meet frazier , but frazier starts to retreat .
lfjoe goes back an inch farther , he' il wind up in a ringside seat .
ali swings with his left , ali swings with his right .
just look at the kid carry the fight .
frazier keeps backin ' , but there' s not enough room .
it' s only a matter of time before ali lowers the boom .
ali swings with his right .
what a beautiful swing .
but the punch lifts frazier clean out of the ring .
frazier' s still risin ' , and the referee wears a frown ...
' cause he can' t start countin ' till frazier comes down .
frazier' s disappeared from view .
the crowd is getting frantic .
but our radar stations picked him up .
he' s somewheres over the atlantic .
now , who would' ve thought when they came to the fight ... they was gonna witness the launchin ' of a black satellite .
but don' t wait for that fight .
it ain' t never gonna happen .
onliest thing you could do ... is wonder and imagine .
this has been another sports exclusive from abc .

how you gonna go from me tojim mckay ?
listen , uh

foreman is all over frazier .
and frazier is down again !
he may be no , he' s rising .

it' d be easy to get a fight with frazier now .

i don' t want to see your head become someone' s bull' s eye .
you think i still got the tools ?
yeah .

you still got the tools , daddy .
but they' re different .
well , we better sharpen them up , ' cause we goin ' to africa .

yes sir .
from the root to the fruit !
we' re gonna rumble in the jungle .
that' s right !
no girls , no pies , champ .
i' il bite you off at the elbow , you touch my pie .
the rumble in thejungle .
that is the name that i' ve given it .
muhammad ali and george foreman in kinshasa , zaire .
don , zaire ?
yeah , don .
i mean , why not antarctica , somethin ' like that ?
what' s wrong with new york city ?
because you miss the significance .
see , i dream of overcoming 400 years of racial depression ... to the dawn of a new day of liberation , financial and otherwise .
it will raise up the spirits of our inner cities .
it will rise up and fill with hope , the souls ... the unrequited needs of the black proletariat .
that is , the discouraged , dispirited , denigrated denizens ... of the demimonde that is called the ghetto .
man , don , you crazy .
you must' ve studied the whole " d " section of the dictionary .
george foreman demolished two of your most difficult opponents .
isn' t it intimidating to you in some way ... to have to face such a reality ?
that' s it with you , cosell .
that' s it , man .
i' m coming down there .
i' ve had it too .
you' ve had it too ?
man , i' m so sick of you .
i' m ready , man .
you been messin ' with me for years .
you wouldn' t hit a man without his coat on , would you ?
cosell , i been holdin ' back for years .
every time i see you , you' re usin ' big words you know i don' t understand .
you' re sayin ' stuff to me .
you asked me the last time , was i truculent ?
well , did you finally find out what that word meant ?
cosell , you never learned listen .
i be seein ' you doin ' interviews on your tv show ... and i realize that you don' t know nobody as famous as me .
you don' t know nobody .
nobody wouldn' t know who you was if it wasn' t for me .
i don' t think that' s exactly right .
wouldn' t nobody in this room look at all these cameras .
all these cameras all over the place , people takin ' pictures .
writin ' down everything i say .
and when they look it up and read it in their newspapers ... and they write it down , folks is lookin ' at it ... it' s gonna say , " muhammad ali and some strange white man .
good morning , sister .
hi , brother .
how you doin ' , champ ?
why they saying that ?
what they sayin ' ?
what that mean ?
i don' t understand .
it means  what ?
it mean , " ali , kill him .
ali , kill him .
the champ is here !
ladies and gentlemen , the heavyweight champion of the world has arrived !
the champ is here !
hey , man .
he' s quite younger than you .
how you feeling about that ?
he' s quite younger than me ?
well , we quite younger than you .
what you talkin ' about ?
thirty two years old .
best shape of my life .
hey , stop !
all right , back up .
did you see muhammad ali ?
you facin ' a man who will die before he lets you win .
here' s your water .
oh , thank you , hon .
bottled water .
frozen steaks .
brought all that stuff in like africa' s ain' t got no steaks .
you could pick up parasites .
mobutu eats it .
mobutu' s takin ' care of mobutu .
he steals all the wealth and sends it to switzerland .
what that got to do with any of why we here ?
we are here ' cause don king got mobutu to put up $10 million .
don king don' t care about africa .
he' s worse than herbert .
here come herbert .
and don king fit right in too .
now he' s a dashiki wearin ' rip off .
don king delivered the first ever ... black promoted championship fight in africa .
don king talks black , lives white and thinks green .
and you' re defending him and brother herbert ?
' cause clean cut muslims in a parade on the south side of chicago ... ain' t gonna get this done !
i got to put honkies with connections and bad ass niggas to it .
and now they matched you up against george foreman .
do you think they give a damn if you get killed ?
so that' s what you think ?
i just wanna know why my muslim husband ... is allowing himself to get strung up on a cross .
just tell me why .
maryum' s sick .
maybe i ought to go back to chicago and look after her ?
sure .
well , then i guess i' il be back before the fight .
if that' s all right , my husband .
hey , cosell !
hey , man .
how many of you ugly sportswriters in there got me over foreman ?
tell the truth .
how are you gonna dance against george ?
he' s sparring with a fast middleweight , training to cut you off .
he gets you against the ropes , he can knock you out with either hand .
you know i name all my fighters .
i' m gonna call george foreman " the mummy .
he fight like a mummy .
here come the left .
here come the right .
but the mummy can' t hit what the mummy can' t see ...
' cause i' m too fast for him .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i move too good for him .
i' il hit george foreman so many times , he' il think he' s surrounded .
he gonna say , " call the police !
it' s five of' em in here !
i' m bad , man .
i' m bad !
muhammad , i' m sorry .
i have to ask .
are you really fast enough anymore ?
many people believe you' re not the man you used to be ten years ago .
see , now , howard ...
i didn' t even want to talk about this , man .
especially not out here in front of all these people .
but i talked to your wife ... and she said you not the man you used to be two years ago !
man , don' t tell me i ain' t the man i used to be .
champ .
champ , george had an accident .
he he had what ?
what are you talking about ?
he got cut right above his right eye .
his sparring partner' s elbow split it open .
can he fight ?
not for six weeks .
this is not a humorous situation , my champ .
this postponement could be long , especially if george leaves .
you trying to pull something here , don ?
if george leaves , he ain' t comin ' back .
george don' t like it here .
how right you are , my suspicious and short italian brother .
look here , man , my fiduciary responsibility ... to this first all black promotion ... is analogous to a garden in the african sun it must grow , it must bloom .
cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to the astrodome ... or any dome out of zaire where it be deprivileged of light and bled of water .
' cause what gonna be bleedin ' out of there is money a hemorrhage of cash .
i' m talkin ' about blood on the floor .
double hotel costs , airplane , travel costs , food and beverage .
so what do you want us to do ?
muhammad ali .
the people' s champion .
my black brother .
i need you .
i need your strength .
i need you to find a way to get george to stay .
be moses in reverse .
do not let my people go .
keep them the fuck right here in egypt .
if you' il pardon my swahili .
lingala .
say what ?
they speak lingala .
ali wants his title , and he wants it in zaire .
okay , all right , okay .
let' s take it back .
george go , george go .
hell , i can get you joe frazier .
ali frazier 3 .
that' s the fight everybody want to see .
we don' t want frazier , we want george .
hell , i don' t control george foreman .
there' s been an accidental injury to george foreman in training .
the truth is ...
george knocked hisself out .
that' s right .
he did three rounds , realized he was gonna lose to muhammad ali ... and knocked hisself out .
i predict that when the fight is set , he might not show .
oh , you bad .
that' s right , i' m a bad man .
ain' t no doubt about that .
yeah , but you tell george the same thing .
i heard you .
i been watching you .
i know he' s your man , i know you got him picked , but the man is in trouble .
the whole world was gonna know , but now he ain' t gonna show .
in order to ensure that george is ready , we are thinking of postponing ... from september 24 to october 30 .
what about the concert ?
the concert will go on as planned .
those dates are september 20 , 21
i want all the helicopters guarded , all the private planes , private boats .
i' m serious .
i want the airports
i want president mobutu and all his paratroopers
all you zaireans , y' all be on guard too .
any strange boats creeping away , they might be taking him out .
bus stations .
and bus stations !
right .
watch the bus stations .
the elephant caravans they might be trying to take him out on an elephant .
what' d you say ?
hell , i ain' t talking to you .
hey .
hey , man .
don' t you never talk to angelo like that .
don' t you never talk to angie like that again .
something wrong with you , man ?
think you callin ' some shots here ?
you ain' t callin ' nothin ' .
they all know .
all them ladies out there , they know i' m ready .
i see fear in the eyes of his followers .
this was supposed to be the fight that muhammad ali was ended .
supposed to be muhammad was gonna fall .
supposed to be my destruction .

they got it wrong .
