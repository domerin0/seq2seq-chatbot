man walks into a bar with a giraffe .
they each get pissed .
the giraffe falls over .
the man goes to leave and the barman says " oi !
you can' t leave that lying there .
he says " no , it' s not a lion .
it' s a giraffe " .
he' s completely humourless .
you two should get on like a house on fire .
so who are you ?
you' re from the hospital .
are you a doctor ?
he' s not a doctor .
he' s a patient .
i' m a bicycle courier .
i was riding a package from farringdon to shaftesbury avenue and a car cut across me .
then i wake up today in hospital .
i wake up and i' m ...
i' m hallucinating or i' m ...
what' s your name ?
jim .
i' m mark .
this is selena .
ok , jim .
i' ve got some bad news .
it started as rioting , and right from the beginning you knew this was different .
because it was happening in small villages , market towns .
and then it wasn' t on the tv any more .
it was in the street outside .
it was coming through your windows .
it was a virus .
an infection .
you didn' t need a doctor to tell you that .
it was the blood .
there was something in the blood .
by the time they tried to evacuate the cities , it was already too late .
the infection was everywhere .
the army blockades were overrun .
and that' s when the exodus started .
the day before broadcasting stopped , there were reports of infection in paris and new york .
we didn' t hear anything more after that .
what' s the government doing ?
there' s no government .
of course there' s a government !
there' s always a government .
they' re in a bunker or a plane ...
no , there' s no government , no police , no army .
no tv , no radio , no electricity .
you' re the first uninfected person we' ve seen in six days .
where' s your family ?
they' re dead .
like selena' s .
yours will be dead too .
look , i have to find them .
they live in deptford .
i can walk it .
ok ?
you' il go and come back , yeah ?
you won' t .
yes !
no one ever comes back .
so lesson one .
you never go anywhere alone unless you' ve got no choice .
lesson two .
only travel during daylight .
unless you' ve got no choice .
we' il take you tomorrow .
we' il all go and find your dead parents together , ok ?
eat .
if you want her to slow down , you' il have to say .
if there' s anyone ...
i understand .
anyone ...
i understand !
ok .
jim ...
wait !
they died peacefully .
you should be grateful .
i' m not grateful .
my ... parents and my sister , we went to paddington station , hoping maybe we could get on a plane , maybe we could buy our way onto a plane .
i remember my dad had all this cash , even though cash was completely useless .
about 20, 000 other people had the same idea .
crowd was surging .
i lost my grip on my sister' s hand .
i remember the ground was soft .
i looked down and i was standing on all these people .
like a carpet .
people who had fallen and ...
somewhere in the crowd there were infected .
it spread fast .
no one could run .
all you could do was climb .
climb over more people .
so i did that .
i climbed .
and i got up on top of this kiosk .
looking down , you couldn' t tell which faces were infected and which weren' t .
then i saw my dad .
not my mum or my sister .
my dad .
his face ...
selena' s right .
you should be grateful .
we don' t have time to get back to the shop before dark .
we should stay here tonight .
my room' s up at the top .
you two can have that .
no , we' il all sleep in the same room .
it' s safer .
jim .
you' re back .
yeah .
how was it ?
fine .
give me a drink of that , will ya ?
it' s empty .
ha !
here .
i' il start working on them , then .
mark !
mark !
selena !
help !
it' s clear .
that' s mr bridges .
were you bitten ?
and his daughter .
from four doors down .
were you bitten ?
no .
did any of the blood get in your mouth ?
no .
mark ?
wait ...
get that cleaned off .
do you have any clothes here ?
um ...
i ...
yes .
then get them and get dressed .
we have to leave now .
more infected will be coming .
they always do .
how did you know ?
how did you know he was infected ?
the blood .
there was blood on me .
it was on you .
i didn' t know he was infected .
he knew .
i could see it in his face .
if someone gets infected , you' ve about 20 seconds to kill them .
it might be your brother , your sister or your oldest friend .
it makes no difference .
just so you know where you stand , if it happens to you , i' il do it in a heartbeat .
he was full of plans .
have you got any plans , jim ?
do you want us to find a cure and save the world or just fall in love and fuck ?
plans are pointless .
staying alive' s as good as it gets .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
what' s that ?
let' s go .
what is it about tower blocks and shopping trolleys ?
stop talking .
it' s a long way up .
do you need a break ?
you ?
no .
now i do need a break .
what' s up ?
nothin ' .
i got a headache .
bad ?
pretty bad .
why didn' t you say something before ?
i didn' t think you' d give a shit .
you' ve got no fat on you and all you' ve had to eat is sugar .
so you' re crashing .
there isn' t a lot we can do about that except pump you full of painkillers and give you more sugar .
as for sugar ,
pepsi or lilt ?
do you have any tango ?
actually , i did have a can of tango somewhere .
quiet !
that' s an infected .
oh no , they' re in .
move !
wait up , selena !
wait for me , please !
please , selena !
please !
wait for me !
come on !
run !
wait !
please !
for fuck' s sake !
selena !
down the corridor .
flat 157 .
move !
thank you .
thank you .
open the door !
open the door !
open up !

where' s dad ?
let them in , hannah .

so , i' m frank , anyway .
jim .
selena .
selena .
good to meet you .
this is my daughter hannah .
come on , sweetheart .
say hello .
come on .
so ...
this is great .
just great .
calls for a celebration , i' d say .
why don' t you all sit down and ...
hannah , what have we got to offer ?
we' ve got mum' s creme de menthe .
great .
creme de menthe .
oh , yeah .
look , sit , please .
get comfortable .
where are the bloody glasses ?
middle cupboard .
nah , the good ones .
it' s a celebration .
top cupboard .
so this is your place ?
it' s nice .
there .
i know it isn' t much but , well , cheers .
cheers .
you ok in there , jim ?
yeah .
sorry we couldn' t spare the water .
same with the toilet .
the flush doesn' t work .
you' il have to use the bucket .
have to empty it each morning .
just chuck it over the balcony .
no mod cons here .
it' s fine .
listen , it' s late .
we' re gonna turn in .
we have a spare room .
in there .
are you and selena ... ?
no .
no , no , no .
um ...
i' il take the living room .
it' s fine .
right .
no , i mean , yeah .
so , um ...
goodnight , then .
yeah .
goodnight , frank .
very spruce .
very shredded .
yeah .
so what do you make of them ?
well , they' re desperate .
probably need us more than we need them .
i think they' re good people .
good people ?
yeah .
you should be more concerned about whether they' re gonna slow you down .
because if they slowed you down ...
i' d leave them behind .
in a heartbeat .
yeah .
i wouldn' t .
then you' re gonna wind up getting yourself killed .
i' m gonna get some sleep .
selena ...
you think i don' t get it , but i do get it .
and i know i' d be dead already if i hadn' t met you .
sure .
no , look ...
i mean , thank you .
and i mean , sure .
goodnight , jim .
goodnight .
we lost water pressure three weeks ago .
i thought we' d be ok with the water from the other flats .
cisterns and tanks .
but it vanishes so quick you wouldn' t believe .
you drink it , it evaporates , turns stagnant .
they' re all empty .
hasn' t rained in ten days .
you can set up a plastic sheet to catch dew and condensation .
saw it on tv once , but i can' t make it work .
you' d never think it .
needing rain so badly .
not in fucking england !
jim , we' re not going to be able to stay here .
there' s been no broadcasts for weeks .
just listen .
salvation is here .
the answer to infection is here . if you can hear this , you' re not alone .
there are others like you .
there are other survivors .
we are soldiers and we are armed .
oh , my god .
soldiers .
quiet .
there' s more .
our location is the 42nd blockade , m602 , 27 miles northeast of manchester .
you must find us .
salvation is ...
now it just repeats .
it' s a recording ?
yeah , it' s a recording .
but this is where it' s telling us to go .
just there .
the way things are , we might need two or three days to get up there .
we " ?
sound carries in this flat .
me and hannah do need you more than you need us .
look , i didn' t ...
no , it' s ok .
it' s the truth .
i can' t leave the block if it' s the two of us .
something might happen to me .
hannah' d be alone .
i couldn' t risk it .
but with other people ...
if it' s a recording , the soldiers who made it could be dead .
it' s possible .
that stuff about the answer to infection ...
there is no answer !
it' s already done all the damage it can !
maybe they have a cure .
maybe they' ve got nothing .
the only way to find out is to reach them .
we could die trying , frank !
or die here .
and anyway , it isn' t true what dad said .
you need us just the same as we need you .
we need each other .
and we' il never be safe in the cities .
the soldiers could keep us safe .
so we have to try and get there .
get there how ?
just so you know , i don' t take cheques or credit cards .
what do you think ?
it' s the most direct route .
then we should take the indirect route .
the one in daylight and not underground .
let' s just get it done .
no , no .
no .
see , this is a really shit idea .
you know why ?
because it' s obviously a shit idea .
so we' re gonna drive into the tunnel full of fucking smashed cars ...
it' s really fucking obviously a shit idea !
hold on !
dad !
fuck !
the world' s worst place to get a flat .
agreed .
i think we' d better do this quick .
i' ve got the wheel .
you' re on the jack .
do you hear that ?
hey , hey , do you hear that ?
hear what ?
right , i' ve done it .
dad ?
jesus christ !
fucking rats !
they' re running from the infected .
move it !
forget the jack , hannah .
there' s no time .
just lift , everyone .
grab hold !
one , two , three , lift !
lift , lift !
don' t look at them !
don' t look !
i can see them !
they' re coming !
come on , hannah !
almost .
get the tyre on , hannah !
i' m trying .
three , two , one , drop it !
get in the car !
come on !
frank , drive !
move it , frank !
whoo !
goodbye , you fuckers !
frank , stop the cab .
let' s shop .
you ...
you ...
you ...
anybody seen any buns ?
hmm .
irradiated .
don' t take anything that needs to be cooked , ok ?
i think you can eat that raw .
decaffeinated coffee ...
put that back .
can' t just take any crap .
if i never see another chocolate bar again , it' il be too soon .
not counting terry' s chocolate orange !
now , single malt , 16 year old , dark , full flavour .
warm but not aggressive .  peaty aftertaste .
takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth .
either we do this now or we' re walking .
not you .
stay close , jim .
what ?
you heard .
where are you going ?
we' ve got enough food , jim .
we don' t have any cheeseburgers .
like going on holidays with your aunt !
oh , jesus .
hello ?
i hate you !
find anything ?
find anything , jim ?
no !
let' s get outta here .
ok , we' re done here .
ok , hannah .
easy .
brake !
brake , brake !
out .
mmmm !
oh my god !
i can , like , taste the vitamin c.
mmmm , the raisins are so moist .
what did you say ?
the raisins .
they' re so moist .
look over here .
like a family .
do you think they' re infected ?
no .
they' re doing just fine .
come on .
let' s eat !
know what i was thinking ?
that you' il never hear another piece of original music again .
you' il never read a book that hasn' t already been written , or see a film that hasn' t already been shot .
um .... that' s what you were thinking .
no .
i was thinking i was wrong .
about what ?
all the death .
all this shit .
it doesn' t really mean anything to frank and hannah because ...
well , she' s got her dad and he' s got his daughter .
so ...
cheeky monkey !
i was wrong when i said staying alive is as good as it gets .
see , that' s what i was thinking .
was it ?
mm .
you stole my thought .
sorry .
that' s ok .
you can keep it .
it' s getting late .
we' d better stay here for the night .
i can' t sleep .
me neither .
doesn' t feel safe , does it ?
outside like this .
i think we' re safe enough .
selena didn' t seem to have any trouble .
yeah , i noticed that .
hey , selena ...
what ?
what is it ?
how' d you get to sleep ?
bloody hell .
must' ve needed a hell of a prescription for that lot .
i didn' t need a prescription .
i qualified as a chemist .
oh , great .
valium .
not only will we be able to get to sleep but if we' re attacked in the middle of the night , we won' t even care .
two each .
not for me , thanks .
can i , dad ?
i don' t think so , sweetheart .
please ?
no .
i can' t sleep .
come on , frank .
let her live a little .
give her half of one .
all right .
we' re on .
night night .
you' re a big softie , frank .
frank ?
hannah ?
frank ?
hello ?
hello !
hello !
hello !
hello !
shh ...
you' re having a bad dream , that' s all .
thanks , dad .
come on , sleepyhead .
come on , babe ruth .
hurry up .
did i miss breakfast ?
you' il sleep through anything .
did you have a fry up ?
we' il stop at a pub on the way .
door !
our location is the 42nd blockade , the m602 , 27 miles northeast of manchester .
you must find us .
please !
salvation is here .
the answer to infection is here .
must be manchester .
the whole of manchester , the whole city .
no fire crews to put it out .
42nd blockade .
this is it .
i don' t understand , dad .
did they leave ?
i don' t like this .
i think we should go .
no !
vehicles .
we should check the vehicles .
there has to be something .
nothing .
i can' t believe it .
frank ...
frank !
we have to go .
yeah .
go fucking where ? !
get out of it .
get out of it !
dad , are you all right ?
yeah , i' m fine , sweetheart .
sorry i lost my temper .
hannah ...
i love you very much .
what ?
keep away from me .
stay where you are .
dad ?
keep away from me !
keep away from me !
keep away !
keep away !
keep away !
dad !
keep away !
keep away !
what' s wrong ?
dad !
jim !
jim , he' s infected !
no !

jim , kill him !
jim !
dad !
kill him !
stay away from him !
keep away from the body !
dad ?
three survivors .
one male , two female .
i repeat , one male , two female .
eta , 15 .
put the kettle on .
i' m major henry west .
welcome .
jim .
hello , jim .
hello .
well , we' ve got beds with clean sheets and a boiler that produces hot water .
so you can all have a shower .
you look like you need one .
please .
it ain' t funny .
i got loads of cooking to do , you fucking doris !
run him over !
how is she doing ?
she' s lost her dad , jim .
that' s how she is .
it' s all fucked .
what do you mean ?
oh , don' t do that .
come on , come on , come on .
hey , don' t do that .
hannah is what frank says she is .
tough , strong , and she' il cope just like i' il cope .
just like you' il cope .
i don' t want her to have to fucking cope .
i want her to be ok .
when hannah had her dad it was ok .
it was ok for them and it was ok for us .
now it' s all just fucked .
so you heard our broadcast ?
yeah , we did .
we must be a disappointment .
you were hoping for a full brigade .
an army base with helicopters and a field hospital .
we were just hoping for ...
the answer to infection .
yeah .
as i said before , it' s here .
though it may not be quite what you imagined .
just feel lucky to have found you .
you were lucky .
the fire drove hundreds of infected out of manchester .
the surrounding area' s teeming with them .
but don' t worry .
you' re quite safe here .
flat terrain all round the house .
floodlights which we' ve rigged up to a generator .
high perimeter wall which helps .
and we' ve been lacing the ground with tripwires and land mines .
you wouldn' t want to mow the lawn , but if they get in , we hear them .
secondary to protection , our real job is to rebuild .
start again .
the belly of the house .
the heart .
a wood fired boiler providing us with hot water .
the first step towards civilisation .
the kitchen .
here you are .
i' il swap you .
now don' t be throwing it .
here , give us some .
don' t be fighting .
will you put that back ?
put it back .
jones , our resident tin opener .
what are you cooking , jones ?
surprise , sir .
i can' t wait .
and lastly , meet mailer .
mailer , jim .
jim , mailer .
got infected two days ago .
mitchell managed to knock him out cold and we got a chain round his neck .
keeping him alive ?
the idea was to learn something about infection .
have him teach me .
and has he ?
in a way .
he' s telling me he' il never bake bread .
farm crops , raise livestock .
he' s telling me he' s futureless .
and eventually he' il tell me how long the infected take to starve to death .
you' il have to wait and see
hope it' s chips , it' s chips
we hope it' s chips , it' s chips
hat .
so , what have we here ?
tinned ham , tinned peas , tinned beans and ...
nice one , doris !
omelette !
it' s a feast , jones .
honour of our guests .
absolutely .
i was going to propose a toast but this omelette will do just as well .
to new friends .
new friends .
jones , did you notice while cooking that these eggs were off ?
i thought the salt might cover the taste , sir .
get rid of it .
doris , you twat .
i don' t suppose you can cook , can you ?
i can' t tell you how badly we need someone with a little flair in the kitchen .
what a fucking disappointment .
i saw those eggs , i thought it was christmas .
we' il have eggs again .
once everything' s back to normal .
you muppet !
look at him , eh ?
he' s still waiting for marks and spencer' s to reopen .
you don' t know nothing .
i think bill' s got a point .
if you look at the whole life of the planet , we ... you know , man has only been around for a few blinks of an eye .
so if the infection wipes us all out , that is a return to normality .
that what you meant , bill ?
yeah , yeah .
have you met our new age sergeant ?
our spiritual guru .
tell me , farrell , exactly why did you join the army in the first place ?
this is what i' ve seen in the four weeks since infection .
people killing people .
which is what i saw in the four weeks before infection , the four weeks before that ...
as far back as i care to remember , people killing people .
which to my mind puts us in a state of normality now .
you' re not eating ?
i don' t want to eat .
you must eat , hannah .
i don' t want to eat .
i want to bury my dad .
he' s one of the people you' re talking about .
let' s go , let' s go , let' s go !
move !
move !
move !
move !
enemy in front !
mick , i fucking got one !
what do you want , a fucking sweetie ?
keep shooting , you cunt !
fucking hell !
he bounced !
cease fire !
i ain' t never seen that in my life !
report clear !
fucking hell !
clear .
clear .
yeah , yeah , clear .
oh , hello !
listen , sweetheart , you ain' t gonna be needing this any more .
cos you got me to protect you now .
you wanna get your hands on a really big chopper , you just come and see me .
fuck you !
that' s an offer , mitch .
give her some .
how about right now ?
mitchell !
easy , tiger .
you don' t wanna go picking a fight with me , son .
sergeant farrell !
mitchell , first action on .
resecure the perimeter .
then get to it .
jones , bedford , go with him .
slow down .
sergeant ?
sir .
clear the bodies off the lawn .
the rest of you , go with him .
my apologies .
drink ?
look , we' re grateful , ok ?
we' re very grateful for your protection but if we' re gonna stay here ...
who have you killed ?
no one .
who have you killed ?
you wouldn' t be alive now if you hadn' t killed somebody .
i killed ...
i killed a boy .
a child ?
yes .
but you had to .
otherwise he' d have killed you .
survival .
i understand .
i promised them women .
what ?
eight days ago i found jones with his gun in his mouth .
he said he was going to kill himself because there was no future .
what could i say to him ?
we fight off the infected or we wait until they starve to death and then what ?
what do nine men do except wait to die themselves ?
i moved us from the blockade , i set the radio broadcasting and i promised them women .
because women mean a future .
selena !
hannah !
what is it ?
we have to go .
jim , wait !
no time !
come on !
come on !
we get in the car and we go !
no !
you' re not going to keep them here !
you' ve got to let them go !
you can' t keep them here !
stay where you are !
i' m not gonna let you keep them here !
you can' t do this !
right , get him !
i want to give you a chance .
you can be with us .
but i can' t let them go .
ok , jim ?
ok .
him too .
smithers says " women and semen don' t mix .
and mr burns says " we all know what you think , smithers .
and that was my favourite joke in the simpsons .
that' s what they' re doing a few hundred miles away , across the channel , across the atlantic .
eating dinner and watching the fucking simpsons !
they' re sleeping in their beds next to their wives .
but we' re here chained to a fucking radiator because the oc has gone insane !
starting the world again when the rest of the world hasn' t even stopped .
just imagine , just think about it .
how could infection cross the oceans ?
how could it cross the mountains and the rivers ?
it can be stopped .
right now tvs are playing and planes are flying and the rest of the world is continuing as fucking normal .
think !
actually think about it .
what would you do with a diseased little island ?
they quarantined us .
there is no infection .
it' s just people killing people . " he' s insane !
time to go .
quarantine ?
please ...
believe me , i' m not interested .
you see , i' m gonna have the black one .
and i' m gonna make her squirm .
mitchell , i swear to god it' s gonna end badly for you .
move .
come on , move !
get up !
get up , you cunt !
fucking move !
get up !
move your fucking arse !
come on then , you fucking pansies .
do me first .
no , mitch .
mitch , just use the gat .
so you' re gonna stick me ?
shoot ' em !
why ?
because it' s fucking quicker !
is that how you' d let your sergeant go out , jones ?
i' il shoot them !
no , you won' t .
you' il let him stick me ?
like a fucking dog ?
i' m gonna enjoy this .
you stupid cunt !
what are you doing ?
you wanna shoot me ?
you wanna shoot me ?
i' il kill you !
where' s he fucking gone ?
fuck it !
get up !
get after him !
jones , move it !
i can see him !
i can see him !
where are you ?
can you see him ?
through there !
oh no .
we' re fucked .
we' re fucked !
relax .
he' s over the wall .
he' s got no vehicle .
and no shooter .
he' s dead .
the first thing we' re going to do is make you look more presentable .
the lady of the house has an extensive wardrobe which she certainly has no use for .
you can' t do it to hannah .
go to the master bedroom , pick out a wide selection .
yes , sir .
no ...
ladies ...
it' s only dressing up !
no !
