hi .
how are you , tasi ?
all right .
i' ve got a job .
go and play somewhere .
where ?
in the hallway .
will you marry me ?
here ?
no , on the outside .
all right , but how ?
you take care of the paperwork , i' il come when i can .
you won' t .
listen , mikkonen .
i don' t think i can help it .
i' m thinking of getting out of here soon .
i see .
how ?
don' t know yet .
somehow .
getting out is no big deal , many people' ve made it .
but they' ve been brought back and ended up doing twice as much time as before .
they' ve stayed here or gone to sweden .
or headed to the nearest bar and got loaded .
you' ve got to go further away .
italy or africa , first at least .
i' ve been thinking about mexico or brazil .
even better .
but that costs money .
you think i haven' t planned it all a hundred times ?
first you need three grand for a passport and ten more for the seamen to hide you in the cargo and to put you off somewhere around the equator .
but it' s dangerous .
if the cargo begins to shift in a storm ...
many' ve died that way .
you must go underground until you get a passport and find the right ship .
how many years do you have left ?
eight , for manslaughter .
but i' m innocent .
are you ?
at least in god' s eyes .
in a way i did kill him , but the truth is i didn' t .
the result was the same : he died , and i was sent here .
all right , let' s go then .
i am 37 now and 8 more makes me about 43 .
then i won' t last 3 hours outside without killing somebody .
kasurinen !
what ?
you can take the floor map with you to bed tonight .
why ?
you can pretend it' s your wedding night .
kasurinen , taisto .
you cannot see him now , he' s in solitary .
why ?
for violent behaviour .
he' s not violent .
the warden whose jaw he broke disagrees .
it was somebody else .
come back on sunday .
he' il be taken to his cell tonight if he' s calmed down .
it' s his birthday , would you take these to him ?
happy birthday .
i didn' t want to begin alone .
age has given me a sweet tooth .
but nobody sends me anything , it' s my own fault .
when other boys had their eyes on girls , i sat in juvenile prison for having taken an old lame granny' s sledge .
mikkonen .
shoot .
this isn' t my birthday , it' s sometime in the winter .
the deal' s off .
you can' t do that !
why not ?
i hear the bitter laughter echo in the darkness
tonight i won' t accuse you of anything
because for you i would walk through a desert haze
on this autumn night my mind is blue
tonight no stars shine to comfort me
i guess it' s useless to hope for anything
best to drown myself in the night
where' s the other witness ?
there isn' t another .
i' il get someone .
in front of these witnesses i ask you irmeli pihlaja do you take taisto kasurinen as your lawful wedded husband in sickness and in health ?
i do .
you having both answered yes to my questions
i pronounce you man and wife .
what ?
dad , the cops are coming .
four thousand , each .
that' s a lot .
there' s not much competition .
all right .
how are you going to get the money ?
don' t you worry about that .
we could help you .
all right .
fix us a car and a gun .
what' s our cut ?
the passports are part of the deal .
a quarter , regardless of the take .
half .
and you can sleep here before and after the job .
and if we get nothing ?
every business has its risks .
when are the passports ready ?
in the morning .
all right .
half .
we need a car in the morning .
give me the gun .
let' s go .
how much did we get ?
enough .
i' il get the passports , you wait here .
why ?
i don' t trust them .
how did it go ?
where' s the passports ?
the car was fucked .
i know .
you couldn' t get it in reverse .
let' s split the take now .
i think we' il take it all .
you' re a risk to me , if you get caught you may start to sing .
the other one' s still outside .
go and get him .
mikkonen ...
take the money and run .
i have to go and i can' t take you with me .
you must be a brave boy and wait here for my call .
meanwhile you can pack your little suitcase .
put in it everything you want to take with you .
we' re going abroad .
irmeli .
what ?
be sure to call me .
we have to get him to hospital .
i know .
stop .
the ship' s called ariel .
tonight at ten o' clock , off hernesaari point .
bury my heart at the dump .
what' s this button for ?
hello .
i understand .
bye .
here' s a package for you .
over here .
where' s mikkonen ?
he won' t be coming .
but we are three .
i' d like to see the money .
all right .
let' s go .
where' s the ariel headed ?
mexico .
didn' t you know ?
somewhere over the rainbow , way up high
there' s a land that i heard of once in a lullaby
somewhere , over the rainbow , skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
