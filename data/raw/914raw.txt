daddy .
i bet it' il be all black and blue by tomorrow .
let me see .
wow , it' s even more swollen than before .
damn , jesse , why would you walk into a door ?
i' il say my man beat me up .
a packet of tigras , please .
usually , it' s the other way round .
yeah , who on earth would walk into a door ?
thank you .
where shall we go for breakfast ?
farine' s ?
you can' t smoke there .
how about jimmy' s ?
it burned down .
you don' t say ?
when ?
i dunno .
i felt like sitting at a terrace , but it was all cordoned off .
anyway , the grub was lousy there .
and it was filthy .
i heard that ...
enough .
it' s bound to be disgusting .
it was disgusting ...
i thought you were dead .
here .
we' re out of oranges .
i had an awful dream ...
oh yes ?
i wonder why .
what' re you dawdling around here for ?
and change those trousers .
they' re jeans .
they' re still blue .
the headmaster says they' re not allowed .
the headmaster' s queer .
charlie !
no , no , no .
no radio .
yes , the radio .
no !

yes .
how come ?
he doesn' t need me .
you don' t need him either , do you ?
chouki ...
drop it !
ok ?
just do what i do .
stay single .
hey , firmin .
does this go under the desk ?
yes , but be careful , ok ?
yeah , yeah .
you don' t know the half of what people say behind your back .
just as well .
i' d be even more bigheaded .
it' s better to have people say bad things about you than nothing at all .
sandrine , i' m not cross , i' m disappointed .
i hated that .
what made you bring that up ?
it just popped into my mind ...
i' d have preferred it if he' d been angry .
soap .
on the washcloth .
what ?
you know i can' t stand that synthetic rubbish .
just don' t do it again , ok ?
ok .
ok .
ok , ciao ...
show off .
let' s go .
come along , sweetheart .
now we' re going up .
paul , why does charlie always have this muck on his fingers when you take him to the dentist' s ?
it' s to stop him biting his nails .
his fingers are going mouldy .
from biting them .
it' s good for my teeth .
the dentist doesn' t give a damn about his teeth .
they' re fine .
maybe you should take him to your manicurist ...
don' t be so bad tempered .
you get on my nerves .
you' re not being very nice to me .
i' m not nice , period .
and stop switching languages .
the kid' il end up speaking neither one .
you' ve got a nerve .
you' re the one mixing up the languages .
same way you get everything mixed up .
who do you think you are , paul ?
you' re 52 years old , and since you finished that book , it' s as if you wanted to finish with me , too .
i refuse to be a character in your epilogue !
i' m your wife .
oh , stop your whining .
yes , mum .
stop your whining .
why is he going to the cellar ?
charlie , for christ' s sake !
it' s the other door for up .
i know that .
antwerp , a friday in june
here we are .
mr garcin , mr garcin ...
i know who stole the money from the sale of the hot dogs !
what are you studying , eyskens ?
classics , sir .
then you know the meaning of the word " sycophant " .
no , sir .
bootlicker " is a somewhat free translation , but it gives the general idea .
look it up and you can explain it to the class next week .
understood ?
my regards to your grandfather .
i too used to consider the future to be the sole competent judge of our works and acts .
only later did i understand that flirting with the future is the worst sort of conformism , cowardly flattery of the strong , for the future is always stronger than the present .
it is indeed that by which we shall be judged , albeit without competence .
but if the future has no value for me , to what do i accord importance ?
god ?
the homeland ?
the people ?
the individual ?
i am attached to nothing , except to cervantes ' decried heritage .
yes ?
sir , it' s a nice text , but isn' t it a bit complicated ?
did you enjoy the text , eveline ?
yes , sir .
and did you understand it all ?
not all of it .
well , that' s just perfect .
where do you want to be dropped ?
at the institute for tropical medicine .
i thought you didn' t go there anymore ?
what are you going to do ?
what ?
what are you going to do there ?
i' m going to pick something up .
what ?
one of these days , you' re going to get caught .
one of these days , you' re going to get caught .
i' m going to die .
goddammit , stop your bullshit .
i was only joking .
well , it' s not funny .
ok ?
oh , come on .
jesus , what' s this ?
nice one , mate .
what' s happening ?
look .
there' re some guys in there .
you' re not serious ?
there .
look .
check this out .
brilliant !
hey , what happened ?
what a question ...
chouki , that ...
how did it happen ?
what ?
i don' t understand .
there' s a bastard taking photographs .
here , grab my hand .
i' il try to open the door , ok ?
what' s wrong with my foot ?
stay calm , man .
ok , i' m calm .
i' m being crushed !
hurry up !
ok .
let' s try again .
it' s not going to work .
idiot !
i think she' s angry .
i' d say disappointed .
some list !
cretin , judas , and then idiot .
bit of an anti climax , eh ?
basel , maybe .
new york , it depends , and chicago is out of the question .
her latest work is just not good enough .
but you promised her .
no , i just said that the latest work isn' t good enough and that she shouldn' t panic ...
what' s his name always used to say that , too .
he' d say ...
you say that to everybody .
but you did promise ...
maybe years ago , at some party , when i still drank .
you still do .
much less .
is she another member of your harem ?
sandrine , " harem " comes from the turkish " harim " which means " sacred " , " forbidden " .
nothing sacred nor forbidden between me and her .
so ?
so what ?
i have a sort of warholian thing with her .
warhol was queer .
warhol was above all very vague .
you couldn' t say that about you .
anybody can see right through you .
is there any merit in being vague ?
i' m not the one who said you were vague .
you' re just trying to confuse the issue .
sandrine ...
idiot .
oh , no .
jeez .
good morning , sir .
police and art !
an initiative of our new chief of police .
from november on , several projects in and around antwerp will present our profession in an artistic light .
art should raise questions " .
that is why the antwerp police have asked nauman to place a video installation in the canteen in begijnenstraat .
and christo is going to wrap up our offices in quinten metsijslei ...
i hate those cops .
where have those chicks gone ?
when did they leave ?
shit , man , that little blond was a real looker .
i couldn' t remember her name .
i kept on asking , then i didn' t dare to any more .
how sweet .
what ?
nothing .
forget it .
iris , irne ...
when did they leave ?
sigrid .
sigrid !
that' s it .
it' s one of those names that just won' t stick .
that sounds nothing like iris .
what was yours called ?
awful woman .
a beautiful woman always has an ugly sidekick .
how did they get here ?
you begged them to come .
and when did they leave ?
jesus , fr , i' m not your goddam biographer .
they just left , that' s all .
the capital of nigeria ?
lagos .
abuja .

just a second , i have to shit .
shitting , pasting , shit , paste ...
any new kiss records ?
come off it , dario , even if they did release a new record , i wouldn' t stock it .
luc sells dance music .
well , well , bolland' s here too .
it' s the dance music snob convention .
i dance to kiss .
maybe so , but here they sell electronic music .
ah , electronic music .
i thought kiss didn' t exist any more .
what ?
he said ...
i heard what he said !
i' il go to a place where they sell mechanical music then .
gentlemen , mum' s the word !

i' m sick and tired of it .

subtle smile .
such a good looking guy .
come on , lara , let' s go and eat .
we' il go to the " daily bread " .

no .
i' ve heard he' s in italy .

jacky ickx wins le mans , there' s an antimissile demonstration in brussels , they blow up the hoveniersstraat , here in antwerp ,
borg plays against mcenroe in the wimbledon final .

your ash is going to fall .
you' re not working today , are you ?
there' s a problem .
oh ?
there' s a big scratch on the cronenberg copy ...
i haven' t used it yet today .
on all 4 reels .
a line on the right of the image .
it was perfect yesterday .
i' m serious , walter .
it' s no laughing matter .
i taught you everything .
are you serious ?
walter , do you remember when they used to write how long a film had run outside on a poster ?
26 weeks .
then it would move into the small auditorium .
52 weeks !
what' s wrong ?
the copies are insured , i' ve got a small deductible ...
there was a scratch on the film .
pierre told me about it .
pierre is an old man .
he wants to end on a high note .
38 years as a projectionist ...
he never could stand me .
you were the last one to use the film .
that' s right .
and there was nothing wrong with it yesterday .
pierre will replace you today .
and tomorrow ?
tomorrow as well .
are you going to fire me , guido ?
it' s not the first time this has happened .
during my training ?
that wasn' t my fault ...
it was pierre ...
pierre what ?
come on , guido , you can' t fire a person for that .
how the hell did that scratch get there ?
bad winding ?
that doesn' t make a line , guido !
at worst , it breaks the film .
what then ?
pierre ?
i want to see that copy .
i sent it back .
sorry , walter .
sorry , my ass .
do you really think so ?
i think he looked more like a penguin ...
are you going to the party , this evening ?
i wasn' t invited .
neither was i.
are you going ?
walter is dj .
what about your daughter , lara ?
do you still see her ?
she' s at walter' s parents .
but tomorrow ...
you don' t see her very often , do you ?
sometimes she spends the whole weekend with me .
a whole weekend .
what business is it of yours , anyway ?
thanks .
erwin , could you take off those shoes ?
it' s mashed potato .
it doesn' t melt under the spots .
i' m ready , thank you .
what a bitch .
drop it , jesse .
oh , sorry .
miss ?
yes ?
have you got " le salaire de i' ennui " by paul garcin ?
paul garcin ...
do you know when it was published ?
june 11th , la presse de saint germain .
you' re well informed .
no .
it' s been withdrawn .
but i can order it for you ...
order it ?
paul garcin , my god ...
ah , van lmmerseel ...
i thought you were dead .
and ?
i heard ...
you were very ill , weren' t you ?
but , here you are ...
yes .
fancy that !
when i left the school , i called you .
your wife answered .
i couldn' t remember her name .
elsie ?
yes .
so i hung up .
silly of me , wasn' t it ?
then i heard that you had cancer .
well ...
well , it' s ...
it' s good to see you again .
you called ?
she didn' t tell me .
well ... of course not .
well .
excuse me , i must be getting on .
if i had died every time i thought i was going to die ,
i' d be seriously fucked by now , you know .
watch out for the cops .
alright , mate .
for christ' s sake .
lazy bastard !
shit , the cops !
who gets nicked if the cops show up ?
lazy bastard !
is it too much to ask you to keep your eyes open ?
what' s going on in your head ?
what the hell do you think you' re doing ?
quit nagging .
felix , you idiot !
what suspense ...
he' s used to it .
idiot !
hello , princess .
shouldn' t you be at work ?
yes .
i just felt like going to collect her .
but shouldn' t you be at work ?
yes , mum , i' m going .
i just wanted to see her .
it doesn' t bother me , you know , picking her up from school .
yes , mum .
i know .
i' il come and pick her up tomorrow .
ok .
goodbye .
i had nothing to do with it .
what happened to that film ?
ask guido .
it has nothing to do with me .
he asked me to replace you .
i came .
and i' m out of a job .
satisfied ?
watch what you say , walter .
you have no reason to accuse me .
i don' t make mistakes like that !
what sort of scratch was it ?
was it regular , or ...
i didn' t see it .
he called me .
i came .
what ?
you didn' t see the damaged copy ?
no .
then how did guido ...
draw your own conclusions , i' m off ...
with a " q " .
frdrique , with a " q " ...
that' s a girl' s name , that is .
you can talk , " nicole " .
it' s " nico " .
undo your laces .
it' s velcro , nicole ...
all the rage in the eighties .
worried i might hang myself ?
how would i know ?
empty your pockets .
for sticking up a poster !
you' ve got to be joking .
i know .
but this is the sixth time .
call this a city .
you' il be going before the prosecutor .
ah , the prosecutor , he' s back from the tyrol ?
yes , and apparently he had good weather .
patrick saw him ...
listen , frdrique .
i' il tell you something ...
i' m not like that .
isn' t there another cell ?
nicole ?
friday ... 4 p .
m ...
21 ...
freezer temperature back to normal .
mice calm .
the one on the left has a slight squint .
it must be due to kemp' s infection .
nothing abnormal .
oxidation , petrol pump sensitive .
hamster still not decomposing .
incredible !
new biotope , new laws .
brussels exhibition cancelled , work seized .
martin hasn' t spoken to me for over a week ...
well ...
potentiometer attached to hamster , measured tension , enough to light a lamp .
so death is another form of ...
chouki !
natalie !
i' m here , in the back .
come out here .
yes , just a minute .
it stinks in here .
are you alright ?
where' s that rabbit ?
you' re looking at it .
haven' t you got work to do ?
i cancelled a few clients .
do you mind closing the door ?
oh , sorry .
you' re still wearing that lab coat .
yes .
it' s weird to see you here .
i ...
this morning , when you went to dad' s lab ...
we never talk about it .
how come we never talk about it ?
i don' t mean what you went there to get .
that' s your business , but ...
why do you never tell me how you feel ?
you never ask me .
yes i do , but you just ignore me .
or you make some cynical remark .
it' s just that i ...
i don' t know ... how i' m supposed to feel ... or how i can ...
i don' t know ...
i miss him so much .
it doesn' t seem to affect you .
sorry .
sorry for what ?
sometimes i get so scared .
with all these things here .
forget it .
i' ve had a lousy day .
you could always throw a party .
thanks for reminding me .
is firmin coming ?
i' il introduce you , don' t worry .
no , no .
forget it .
why did you ask then ?
if you could choose between physical tendemess and an intellectual discovery , which would you prefer ?
i believe that everything is an intellectual discovery , including the decision to be tender
when are you going to paint this place ?
next week .
in blue .
why not black ?
blue .
when is she arriving ?
she' s here ...
no , can' t be .
god , i look awful .
better than yesterday .
great .
when i turned 32 , i shaved all my hair off .
you know what my mother said ?
it' s much better like that " .
what does she look like ?
i dunno , it' s been a long time .
but she used to be beautiful .
were you in love with her ?
how do you express emotion ?
i don' t know .
it' s difficult to explain .
at the cinema when nobody' s looking
what do you prefer ?
to admire , or be admired ?
admiring oneself is a bit like fleeing one' s responsibilities
what do you think about love , mr delvoye ?
it' s hypnosis
being in love is a form of self hypnosis
it' s a threat disguised as an invitation
how do you feel about promiscuity ?
i think you should be faithful as much as possible
do you prefer the love of one woman or the love of a large audience ?
the love of a large audience , because the mass is greater and it takes longer to cool down
but even that cools down in the end
successful creativity acts like a drug
are you hooked , mr delvoye ?
i think creativity is hooked on applause
do you know what makes a woman happy in a relationship ?
yes
happiness just has to be grabbed ?
there' s no need to grab it , or even stoop down to pluck it y ou either have it , or you don' t
are you often on the run ?
what a day !
come dancing with me later .
i' ve got an appointment .
a date ?
you could call it that .
with a guy ?
imagine that .
how long have you known him ?
a few days .
why didn' t you tell me ?
you' re going to move .
you never tell me anything , either .
what does he look like ?
he' s not exactly good looking , his head' s a bit large , but he' s full of charm .
and he lisps when he' s drunk .
it' s so sweet .
that' s great .
yeah , we' il see ...
what about your black eye ?
i' il buy some glasses .
you' d better hurry up , it' s nearly closing time .
really ?
yes .
so , these people live together 50 years in the mountains
everything' s good , good air , good soil , everything nice and healthy .
they don' t drink , they don' t smoke , so nothing can go wrong .
and after 50 years , these people die together , the very same week , from lung cancer .
well , it' s possible .
yes , it' s possible , but ... it' s still mind boggling .
i don' t understand .
i don' t understand .
alright .
just forget it .
you and your non stories .
are you buying food for everybody ?
just the basics .
people will bring drinks .
they bring a bottle of wine and drink your vodka .
i know how it goes .
would you like a crisp ?
leave them alone .
but the people here look so unhappy .
perhaps they are unhappy .
what , all of them ?
yes , all of them !
excuse me , madam , are you unhappy ?
not at all .
my son has just got his doctorate from harvard .
he' s a nuclear physicist .
what about you , sir ?
are you unhappy ?
me ?
far from it .
but i' ve got a hernia and the trolleys are too low .
and you ?
we' re just in a bad mood .
see ?
look , soap for walter .
i can' t even wear my watch any more .
i never wear a watch .
i hate them .
don' t speak with your mouth full .
you could wear it on the other wrist .
well spotted , charlie .
dad doesn' t need a watch .
he' s already had his time .
mum' s a bit mean , isn' t she , dad ?
don' t get them bickering .
who do you think you are ?
kofi annan ?
he' s right .
charlie can be very manipulative .
who is kofi annan ?
imagine
kofi annan at school , when there was a fight .
be nice to one another .
his english is good !
yes , it' s better than his french !
who is kofi annan ?
do you have any troublemakers in your class ?
no , only bootlickers .
you' ve connected that old thing again ?
it' s better than " toooooot " .
is kofi annan a bootlicker ?
kofi annan is a mediator .
and ?
it' s ok .
and he says hello .
be careful next time .
what' s ok ?
aids test .
ah , aids test .
he' s sixteen .
you can' t stop him having sex at his age .
but he must be more careful next time and use a condom .
don' t speak like that in front of charlie .
next you' il be telling me that the kid masturbates .
what does " masturbate " mean ?
charlie , don' t read at the table .
thomas , will you keep an eye on your brother later ?
i' m going dancing .
what ?
you' re coming with me ?
no , you' re coming with me .
how about going together ?
i' il go and get ready .
marina ?
it' s walter .
is guido there ?
no , i' ve been there .
no , he' s not at the cinema .
no , his mobile' s off .
he fired me .
i don' t know .
if you see him , tell him to have the fucking balls to call me back .
sorry , marina .
i know it' s nothing to do with you .
ciao .
watch out !
thanks .
you' ve never played korfball ?
haven' t you got a brother ?
no , i haven' t .
i' ve got two big sisters .
and a gigantic mother .
no , the red .
i saw a microlight plane fly really low over the town just now , and the pilot waved to me .
did you wave back ?
you bet .
i went " helloooooo " .
fr , do you know benny ?
no .
fr , benny .
hello .
benny' s blind .
yeah ?
that makes a change .
i' m 1 m 90 tall and i' m wearing a stephen sprouse suit .
really ?
that' s funny .
what' s funny about it ?
you sound more like someone who' s 1 m 60 tall and wearing a pair of tight trousers .
wow , a visionary blind man .
let' s drop the stupid blind men jokes .
you break , i' il play with fiona .
what about me ?
you play with me .
i don' t suppose i have much choice .
no .
here , that' s for saving me .
cheers .
good health .
what do you think ?
the more you wear them , the better i like them .
i' m going to wear them all evening .
i can' t talk to the guy like this .
there' s nothing to be ashamed of .
no , but it' s cooler like this .
you sniffed both of them .
i' m sorry .
it doesn' t matter .
there' s a dealer who owes me some money .
usually it' s the other way round .
yeah , who on earth would lend money to a dealer ?
i' m going .
already ?
i' m late .
a woman should never be too early for a date .
and if the guy arrives late , he' s done for .
i hope he' s on time .
it' d be a perfect beginning .
it was in rome .
i was alone at night in the street , and all of a sudden i was surrounded by 3 italians , acting stupid , pulling on my jacket and saying " ciao bella " .
what did you do ?
come on , let' s move into the light ...
and then ?
i started picking my nose like mad .
good trick .
what did the guys do ?
they left .
do you want half ?
yes .
are you alright ?
yes .
great party !
natalie .
hi , dario .
take it easy tonight , ok ?
mum' s the word , eh ?
that' s right .
mum' s the word .
hey , how are you ?
fine .
are you natalie ?
yes .
i' m mario , the dealer .
if you ever need ... er , business cards , i know a printer .
capoeira !
go on , chouki .
let me introduce you .
no , really .
i hate to be pushed on someone .
i can make a fool of myself on my own .
he' s ok .
i used to go to his gym .
he gave me a discount .
lucky for you .
look , he' s flirting with a girl .
he hasn' t got time .
i' il suggest we sniff a line together .
elsie , i' m shocked .
does paul know you take drugs ?
i don' t even drink coffee .
i haven' t taken any for ages .
but i like to play the go between .
he' s claustrophobic , did you know that ?
who isn' t ?
no .
i' m serious .
nobody likes to be in a dark place with nothing to look forward to .
my husband does , in his office ...
my marriage is fucked up .
the last time we had sex was after grn' s header against the dutch .
when was that ?
in ' 85 ?
that can' t be right .
my son is seven .
i don' t know a thing about football .
neither do i , but when the belgians play ...
it' s fucked up .
and i like her .
i think it' s all over .
but you' re a teacher , that' s worth something .
you' re talking about very intimate stuff .
life deals you blows , the important thing is to stay beautiful .
what do you do ?
me ?
yes , it' s the first time again .
that' s true .
girls are good at it , because it' s an intuitive game .
i thought blind men didn' t smoke because they can' t see the smoke .
i' ve got my period .
does that make you less intuitive ?
you feel less like being intuitive .
can you do that ?
she' s moving the ball .
if the ball is touching the edge , you can move it the width of the cue .
bocelli ?
yes ?
have you ever heard that ?
in some " pawwish " centres , yes .
don' t tell me that on top of being blind , you can' t pronounce the letter " r " .
leave him be .
the letter " r " isn' t so important .
i guess not .
and neither is having a view of the sea .
frdrique , don' t be so rude .
a view of the sea is something that you can describe .
but how do you describe a fugue by bach ?
you can' t .
the ear has a much wider range .
see ?
no , but i heard .
what is it , benny ?
are you empathising with the table ?
no .
i need to go to the toilet .
come on , i' il take you .
and i suppose his car was in the bathroom ?
yes .
put some kiss on , mate .
kiss !
later , later .
yes , no , wait sweetheart .
i' m going outside .
i can' t hear you .
oops .
i tripped .
are you coming ?
what d' you mean , no ?
go on , come .
please come , babe !
what are you coming for ?
do you want one ?
no , thanks .
you neither ?
four of us here , and nobody wants a snort ?
alright , just a little one .
elsie , i' m shocked .
four of us in one toilet !
there' s plenty of room .
firmin' s claustrophobic .
everybody is .
name one person who ...
continue your story .
how did the truck overturn ?
i was busy taking photos , and then i noticed that the back door was open .
that' s when i saw it .
come on , chouki , tell us what you saw .
look for yourself .
a dead horse !
firmin !
be careful with the coke !
what d' you mean , " shush " ?
they must' ve guessed by now .
it fell against the van , died , and that flipped it over .
unbelievable !
it' s not possible .
why not ?
afterwards , i talked to those guys .
you should' ve seen their faces !
insane !
just before , they' d delivered another horse , and that one dropped dead too !
werner , the other horse , is dead too .
how come ?
how would i know ?
a horse called werner ?
where did this other horse drop dead ?
at a wedding .
oh , come off it .
a horse called werner .
hey , paul !
how are you ?
you' re looking well !
been to the barber' s ?
on an impulse .
looks good .
i' m just glad somebody noticed .
and how are you ?
well .
i hardly know anyone here , but i' m glad elsie came .
she took some persuading .
really ?
you know what she' s like .
are you alright ?
yes .
and you ?
i' m fine .
how' s natalie ?
how' s natalie ?
fine .
as long as she doesn' t know i' m with you .
how' s walter ?
he' s with his ex .
he looks so tense .
walter' s always tense .
did julie go swimming on thursday ?
yes .
how do you know that ?
he goes out too much .
during the week , i work in the evening , he works during the day .
and on weekends , he takes pills and gets pissed .
i said to him " come on , this is no relationship " .
i can' t take it any more .
it' s not a relationship , it' s ...
sorry .
what does he want to do about it ?
i don' t know .
i haven' t seen him for the past two weeks .
stupid cops .
you know what we should do ?
attack the oudaan
you' ve got to admit , it would be absurd .
completely pointless .
who on earth would expect someone to attack a building full of cops ?
stay away from the pills , fr .
they' re turning your brain into moosh .
you take them too .
me ?
never .
a little joint from time to time .
that' s all .
that' il turn your brain into moosh .
i don' t take pills or smoke joints .
alcohol does turn your brain into moosh .
i don' t take drugs and i don' t drink alcohol ...
if that doesn' t turn your brain into moosh ...
what does moosh mean ?
stay home ...
felix ...
the cops , 13th floor , in the canteen .
the cops ' canteen is on the 13th floor ?
what idiot would put the canteen on the top floor ?
it takes an hour for everyone to come down , ... or go up ...
they' re going to think it' s so ridiculous , us taking the place hostage .
i bet there isn' t even a law against it .
and our demands ...
our ultimatum !
attacking a police station .
it reminds me of a film ...
what film ?
nothing .
we demand nothing .
we' il just sit down a while , have a coffee ...
shall we go ?
have a smoke .
what ?
shall we go ?
it' s a private party .
they' il be sitting round the table playing " risk " .
risk " is a great game .
no .
it' il be ok .
natalie asked me to bring some friends along .
alright .
there' s nothing else to do .
i' il just go and have a crap .
i' m not driving .
i' m too stoned .
you don' t want to drive ?
no .
who' s going to drive , then ?
i dunno .
benny ?
no , seriously .
felix !
let fiona drive .
should we take something ?
yes , i think so .
a bottle ?
yes .
and who' s going to pay ?
i' il advance .
get a bottle of red .
i thought you didn' t drink .
hey , it' s party time .
who is this natalie girl ?
she' s great .
you' il see .
what sort of people will be there ?
a bunch of wankers ?
that firmin guy ...
he invited a lot of people .
my second book was a flop too .
yes , i read a review .
criticism is to the artist what ornithology is to a bird .
in " de standaard " ?
a vicious article .
yes , i didn' t realize they were talking about you .
so nasty .
where' s the ice ?
in the bucket .
and it was written by a former colleague of mine .
paul garcin is the pol pot of flemish letters " .
that was too much .
really too much .
firmin , this is paul , my french teacher from school .
the pol pot of flemish letters ?
vrij nederland " was even worse .
what ?
the idi amin of the roman cls ?
the general pinochet of science fiction .
the ceaucescu of children' s stories ...
the mickey mouse of cartoons .
what are you doing now ?
i' m writing a book .
don' t i know you from somewhere ?
your wife , didn' t she use to come to the fitness club ?
about fifteen years ago ?
yes !
what were you doing in a fitness ?
it was my club .
slender you " .
losing weight without paling .
without moving , i mean !
it was all very 80s .
where' s the ice ?
in the bucket !
there were big benches that moved ...
it didn' t work at all , but it was such a success !
wasn' t it 1 . 200 francs an hour ?
a half hour !
all the chicks fell asleep .
especially his .
i made loads of money with yours .
where' s the ice ?
in the bucket !
how are you doing ?
great .
like a new pair of shoes .
like a new pair of shoes ?
i got fired today .
i didn' t .
i liked my job .
why ?
why what ?
why were you fired ?
i don' t know .
i wasn' t fired , and i don' t know why either .
there was a damaged copy .
a copy ?
a copy of a film .
i want you to come back to me .
lara , don' t start that again .
it' d be nice , wouldn' t it ?
wouldn' t it be nice ?
lara , this is natalie' s party .
i feel great .
oh , they' re having a party here too .
where' s the toilet ?
this way .
i gave this to natalie as a gift .
it' s by tom wesselman .
when i was little , i was fascinated by the form of this image .
i didn' t know what it was .
i couldn' t see it .
it was hung high up in the living room .
but when i grew up , i saw what it was .
a naked woman .
can you imagine ?
abstract became concrete .
and it lost nothing of its power .
that' s it for me , getting a hard on for an abstract woman .
d' you understand ?
yes , yes .
here are a few ideas .
do you want to read them ?
huh ?
look there .
jeff wall .
you know that ?
a sudden gust of wind " .
wild work .
look at it ...
great memories ...
how come that blind guy has so much luck with the girls ?
i dunno .
ask him .
bocelli ?
yes ?
how come you' ve always got chicks hanging around you ?
i dunno .
girls like you to chat with them , not just feel you' ve got the hots for them .
so women don' t give you the hots ?
of course , but they don' t realize , get it ?
yeah , right .
benny' s a very clever guy .
no , i' m not clever .
besides , there are no stupid people , just people who are unlucky .
is there anything you don' t have a theory about ?
greediness .
that i don' t understand .
but you must have some theory about it .
this is way too deep .
yesterday , my boyfriend ...
shut the fuck up about your boyfriend !
you' ve been flirting with stevie fucking wonder all night .
there' s nothing wrong with that .
unlucky boyfriend !
i' m going to dance .
dance ?
to this music ?
at the table , this morning ,
i tried to screw the top of the heinz sandwich spread on the gherkin jar .
and it worked !
then i tried to screw the top of the gherkins on the sandwich spread , and that worked too .
say , what happened to your hand ?
walter is the complete opposite of a hypochondriac .
why ?
he suffers from imaginary healing .
have you got something against the 80s ?
no .
why ?
i heard you talking in the kitchen .
something about the 80s ...
why do you ask ?
we choose our words .
scientists don' t say just anything .
when they say a word , it' s as if they were giving the definition of it .
it' s not like a writer , for example .
are you quoting something from a film ?
yes , maybe .
people my age have to quote from films .
or television .
the 20s , 30s , 40s , the fucking 50s and 60s , the overblown 70s ...
of all the decades of that fucking century , why is it always the 80s that get shat on ?
i heard your tone , mate , it was pure scorn ...
wow !
super !
this armchair is so 70s !
i' d love an american car from the 50s !
but try getting someone to say something good about the 80s .
oh , no .
the 80s sucked .
the 80s had no style .
there was a depression , thatcher , the supermarket killers , aerobics , keith haring , the clothes were ugly , the music was bad !
no , man , no !
the music was way out , the clothes were beautiful !
but keith haring sucked !
yes .
ok .
take david bowie ...
people say the 80s were his worst period .
not true .
no way .
it was david bowie' s best period !
keith haring ?
what year ?
what year was keith haring ?
frdrique , would you try asking the dj to play something from kiss ?
i' ve got to go and change the record .
how about another slow ?
don' t be ridiculous .
you' ve been dancing with her all evening .
5 minutes .
i danced with her once .
have you taken something ?
let me see .
no .
she' s playing games .
why do you let her ?
we have a child together .
ah , she has a kid , has she ?
quit it , natalie .
calm down , mate .
mind your own business .
what is it with you ?
come on , chouki .
what are you doing with this loser !
goddammit !
stop that !
shit , man , they' re fighting .
i' ve got to put a record on .
you do that .
go and put a record on .
i' m not doing anything .
let me go !
don' t touch me !
i didn' t do anything .
he' s the crazy one .
come on .
what i like even better than watching people , is watching people watching people .
see that girl over there ?
yes .
now , look over there , the shabby looking man ...
now look at the young man over there .
hey , what are you doing ?
mum' s the word , eh ?
is that party still on this evening ?
you haven' t slept yet , and you' re already thinking about tonight .
i can' t think about parties now .
me neither , man .
could you close the window , please ?
no , really ...
is that party at charlotte' s still on ?
yeah , man ...
if she doesn' t commit suicide .
my god , you' re so cynical .
cynical ?
i' ve only known you for 24 hours and you already get on my nerves .
sorry .
she' s always talking about suicide .
the other day , she called me to say that i had one of her salad bowls and a jar of vinaigrette .
you can keep them " , she said .
and that van morrison cd " .
how come ? " .
i' m going to end it all " .
i replied : " charlotte , the salad bowl gets in my way , the vinaigrette is off , and the only
van morrison cd here , is mine .
in other words , you' re ' giving ' me two things i don' t want , and one which already belongs to me !
so , if you die tomorrow all that i get from you is a jar of vinaigrette and a salad bowl .
great !
me , making a salad ?
she' s always talking about committing suicide .
she' s tried it on with me , too .
same as peter' s sister .
and then she starts to blubber ...
who ?
peter' s sister ?
no , charlotte !
over that fucking van morrison cd !
is it yours ?
you don' t really strike me as a van morrison fan .
listen , you pseudo ray charles , i was listening to van morrison before you got your first pair of stone washed jeans .
in other words , i had style before you could read the words " duran duran " in braille .
word .
what ?
the ' words ' duran duran " , but it' s the same word twice .
so it' s the " word " duran duran .
it' s still two words , you dumb fuck .
one word , said twice .
so ?
it' s still two words .
the ' name ' duran duran " .
the ' names ' duran duran " , would you ?
and you don' t say : " the sports ping and pong " .
jezus .
why do you guys live in antwerp ?
if you don' t mind me asking .
can we drop you somewhere , benny ?
no .
thanks for the tea .
you' re spoiling me .
it' s my pleasure .
how was your date ?
it didn' t go too well .
it' s not that he' s an idiot , but when he' s drunk , he' s impossible .
yesterday you were telling me how cute his lisp was .
after three hours , i' d had enough .
i was soaked through .
poor thing .
and he went on and on about his english friends .
what d' you mean ?
his " english friends " .
a long tale about his " english friends " .
are they here ?
no , they' re still in liverpool .
then another rambling story about that .
irritating !
with his big head and all .
and who' s that ?
i brought him back with me last night .
he was too drunk to walk .
he' s a writer .
couldn' t you find anything younger than that ?
here ... vitamins .
i' d better be going .
what happened to your hand ?
how did i get here ?
you couldn' t remember where you lived .
all you did was sleep , paul .
all i did was sleep ...
all i dld was sleep ...
all i did was sleep .
my wife read somewhere that men reveal all their secrets if you dip their left hand in hot water while they sleep ...
hot water ?
yes , not boiling .
all she had to do was ask .
because men don' t have secrets ...
no , just things they' re ashamed of .
what' s that ?
what ?
where ?
what' s wrong ?
shit , what time is it ?
i don' t know .
twelve thirty .
you' ve got to go and get julie .
yes , i know .
why do you want to be in my gallery ?
everybody started out with you ...
why would i risk taking this on ?
there' s no risk .
have you read it ?
yes , with a bad hangover .
so why did you ring me so early ?
for talent .
i do the craziest things .
where did you get these bacteria from ?
that' s not important .
i' ve got them with me .
i had them yesterday , too .
you came to my party yesterday carrying plague germs ?
to your party ?
yes .
and above 4 degrees , they become ultra active .
they' ve had a tough time .
do you realize what such an injection could mean ?
of course .
you' re mad .
this isn' t a fucking gimmick , firmin , it' s well founded .
suicide is always well founded .
but this isn' t suicide !
that' s the point !
how wonderful .
listen , chouki , i appreciate what you' re doing , but that' s not how it works .
you don' t just take your dossier to a gallery and expect us to jump up and down .
understand ?
show me those tubes .
there' s nothing to see in these tubes .
show me .
sounds like you' ve got a stuffy nose .
i know .
shit , what' s this ?
put your shoes on , there' s glass everywhere .
is it bleeding ?
yes , i' ve cut myself .
oh , my god !
fuck !
jesus christ !
idiot !
what was that ?
nearly knocked a guy down .
watch out for my car , will you ?
i didn' t see him .
he was in the wrong .
the pedestrian is always right .
yes , benny , you' re right .
hello , yes ?
hey , fr , didn' t we stick posters there ?
goddam bastards !
come on , let' s paste over them .
where is the goddam thing ?
it' s ok here .
fr , the car !
i don' t believe it !
do you have to go to work later on ?
yes ...
alright , i' il do the cleaning up .
oh , no .
i' il call fiona .
what a fucking mess .
there were loads of people , eh ?
and what weirdos !
i don' t understand some folks .
take the crowd that was here last night .
i sometimes feel i' m the only normal person around .
don' t you ?
yeah .
what do they all do during the day ?
same thing .
i couldn' t live like that .
am i being a pain ?
no .
maybe i' m the one who' s boring , and they' re normal ?
i dunno .
you know , you can tell me if you think i' m boring .
for christ' s sake , stop worrying about what others think .
what did you invite them for , anyway ?
they fascinate you .
you' re hooked on weirdos .
you' ve even got one in the family .
but it was fun , wasn' t it ?
yes .
but you still haven' t told me whether you think i' m boring .
no , natalie , you' re not boring .
what' s your favorite animal ?
what ?
your favorite animal .
answer immediately .
sparrow .
sparrow ?
ok .
why ?
answer immediately .
because they' re ... sweet , not really interesting , but kind ... and because they' re nearly extinct ...
i feel sorry for them .
ok .
your second favorite animal ?
the hippopotamus .
why ?
answer immediately .
because on the outside they' re surly and aggressive , but on the inside they' re gentle and unhappy , because they prefer to live underwater , but they always have to get back onto land to survive .
the 1st animal is the way you see your partner , and the 2nd is how you see yourself .
my animal' s certainly right ...
so , i' m gentle , sweet and not very interesting ...
i' m a real hippopotamus , i am ...
and i' m a sparrow .
they shit straight out , did you know that ?
the shit comes straight out , and then they go like that with their tail .
all over the place .
sparrows ?
really ?
hippopotamuses ...
she' s been waiting for you .
sorry , it was a late night .
was it fun ?
it was ... turbulent .
are you coming in for a while ?
no , we' re going for a walk .
aren' t we , sweetheart ?
it' s nice weather .
a big kiss for granny .
goodbye , sweetheart .
thanks , mum .
here , darling ...
your schoolbag .
goodbye !
bye .
and ?
how did it go ?
ok .
ok ?
come on , then .
that' s good .
yes ?
what the hell are you doing ?
open the door .
i' m in the bath .
come back later .
no , i' ve got to come in now open the door
what' s the matter ?
i can' t tell you open up , please
chouki , come back in an hour .
i' m enjoying this .
besides , i cut my ...
art and police , an initiative ...
is there anyone else in the house ?
no .
leave everything just how it is , ok ?
i' il be back straight away
what a pest .
art should raise questions " , that' s why the police has decided to ask nauman to place a video installation in the canteen in begijnenstraat ...
hey , you losers !
bunch of losers !
something bothering you ?
something wrong ?
get a grip .
what' s wrong with you ?
picking a fight with a baby ?

let' s go to the cops ' .
yeah , wait .
i' ve got to have a crap first .
how many times do you have to shit in 48 hours ?
and why tell me every time ?
is it important for me to know ?
some sort of warning ?
don' t go on like that .
what' s with you ?
going on , eh ?
going on ?
first i get caught by the cops because you' re chasing girls .
then you let someone steal my car before i can even drive it ...
you haven' t got your licence .
i' ve passed the theory ... ... it' s still my car .
then i get insulted by a baby while you talk about your bowel movements !
in my family , when someone had to take a crap , you just came out and said so .
it was ok .
really ?
how touching .
i get a glimpse of how hard your childhood must have been .
really interesting .
thank you so much .
we can' t just go to the cops like that .
yes , we can .
my car' s been stolen .
thanks .
oh , yeah .
there was a blind man in it .
i beg your pardon ?
there was a blind guy in the car .
there was somebody in the car when it was stolen ?
yes .
that' s kidnapping !
well , yes , i guess so .
thanks .
you don' t mean someone actually intended to kidnap benny ?
not really , but he was still in the car , fr .
figure it out for yourself .
what date is it today ?
i don' t know .
they' il fill that out upstairs .

boutelier ?

while he was teaching ?
yes .
i bowed , he called out " on guard " , then he collapsed .
stupid .
but he' s ok .
what a champion , my son .
he just bows to his adversary , who falls down dead .
what mental power !

he was dribbling , doing well .
vincent , come over here a minute .

he asked me to ask you if you wanted to come along .
he' d enjoy that .
with the little girl .
how about it ?
the river schelde .
speeding along , with the wind in your hair .
yes , the wind in your hair .
