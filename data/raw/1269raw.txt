enough' s enough , curly .
you can' t eat the venetian blinds , i just got them .
down the hatch .
she' s no good .
what can i tell you ?
when you' re right , you' re right .
and you' re right .
i' il pay you the rest next week .
we only caught 60 tons of skipjack .
they pay less for skipjack than albacore tuna .
i only brought it up to illustrate a point .
i don' t want your last dime .
thank you , mr gittes .
call me jake .
careful driving home .
mrs mulwray is waiting for you , with mr walsh and mr duffy .
mrs mulwray , may i present mr gittes .
mrs mulwray , how do you ?
mr gittes .
what seems to be the problem ?
my husband ...
i believe is seeing another woman .
no ... really ? .
i am sorry .
mr gittes , do you think we could discuss this alone ?
i' m afraid not .
these are my operatives ,
and at some point they' il have to assist me .
i can' t do everything myself .
of course not .
what makes you certain that your husband is involved with someone ?
a wife can tell .
do you love your husband ?
yes , of course .
then go home and forget everything .
i' m sure he loves you too .
let sleeping dogs lie ?
you' re better off not knowing .
i have to know .
very well .
what is your husband' s first name ?
hollis .
hollis mulwray .
water and power ? .
he' s chief engineer .
chief engineer ? .
this type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook .
it takes time ...
money doesn' t matter to me .
okay , we' il see what we can do .
today you can hop a streetcar , and in 25 minutes , you end up in the pacific .
you can swim in it and fish in it , but you can' t drink it .
you can' t irrigate an orange grove with it .
we live next door to the ocean , but we also live on the edge of a desert .
los angeles is a desert community .
beneath this building is a desert .
without water , the dust will rise up cover us as though we never existed .
the alto vallejo can save us from this .
i suggest that 8 million dollars is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert from our streets , and not on top of them .
mayor bagby ...
let' s hear from all the departments again .
we' d better take water and power first .
mr mulwray ? .
in case you' ve forgotten , over 500 died when the van der lip dam gave way .
this shale is similar to the permeable shale in the van der lip disaster .
it couldn' t withstand that kind of pressure .
now you propose another dirt banked dam ,
with slopes of 2 to 1 , 1 12 feet high , and a 12 000 acre water surface .
well , it won' t hold .
i won' t build it , it' s that simple .
i' m not going to make the same mistake twice .
what the hell are you doing ?
get those goddam things out of here !
tell me where to take them !
you don' t have an answer for that .
you steal water from the valley , ruin the grazing , starve the livestock ...
who' s paying you to do that , mulwray ? .
that' s what i want to know !
save your clty los angeles is dylng of thlrst vote yes
jeez , he was there all night .
that' s right .
i had to go back three times to pick up the watches .
yesterdayhe went to three reservoirs , a men' s room , and the pig & whistle .
the guy' s got water on the brain .
so what have you got ?
this ?
they got into a terrific argument .
what about ?
i don' t know .
the traffic was loud .
apple core " .
apple core ?
yeah .
is that what you spent the day doing ?
you said to take pictures , so i did .
let me explain something to you , walsh .
this business requires a certain amount of finesse .
what is it , sophie ?
duffy' s on the phone .
duff , where are you ?
the buzzard' s got a cute little twist .
slow down .
where are you ?
they' re in echo park , in a rowboat !
okay ...
echo park .
water again .
okay , pal , let' s have us a big smile .
you' il love it .
when you get this much publicity , you' re practically a movie star .
look at that , barn .
yeah , the heat' s murder .
fools ' names and fools ' faces .
what' s that , pal ?
you' ve got some way to make a living .
what do you do to make ends meet ?
mortgages .
first national bank .
did you foreclose on many families this week ? .
we don' t publish records in the paper .
neither do l .
no , you have your press agent do it .
is this bimbo a regular customer ? .
i make an honest living .
i help people when they' re in a desperate situation .
i don' t kick families out of their houses like you bums at the bank do .
maybe you' d like to go outside and discuss it .
what do you think ? .
let me tell you about the guy ...
i don' t know how it got in the paper .
i make an honest living .
of course you do .
anyway , this guy got tired of screwing his wife .
so his friend says he should do what the chinese do ...
duffy .
hey , walsh !
sophie , go to the little girls ' room for a minute .
but mr gittes ...
yes , mr gittes .
i want to tell you a story .
there' s a guy who' s tired of screwing his wife ...
jake , there' s a problem .
wait a second .
his friend says to do it like the chinese do it .
how do the chinese do it ?
well , first they screw a little bit , then they read a little confucius ,
come back , screw a little bit more , then they stop again ...
jake !
walsh , just listen , you' il love this .
they go back and they screw a little bit more ,
and then they contemplate the moon .
it makes it more exciting .
so now the guy goes home and starts screwing his own wife .
so he screws her a little , then goes out of the room and reads life magazine .
he goes back in and screws her a bit , then goes out and smokes a cigarette .
his wife is sore .
hey , what' s the matter with you ?
you' re screwing just like a chinaman !
jesus , that barney ...
mr gittes ?
yes .
do you know me ?
well ...
i think i would have remembered .
have we ever met ?
well , no .
never ? .
never .
that' s what i thought .
i' m mrs evelyn mulwray .
mr mulwray' s wife .
not that mulwray ? .
yes , mr gittes .
that mulwray .
and since you agree that we' ve never met before ,
you must also agree that i never hired you to spy on my husband .
i see you like publicity , mr gittes .
well , you' re going to get it .
there' s been some misunderstanding .
there' s no need to get tough with me ...
i don' t get tough with anyone .
my lawyer does .
here' s something for you , mr gittes .
i suppose we' il be hearing from your attorney .
mr mulwray ? .
he' s not in , mr .. ?
may i ask what it' s regarding ?
it' s personal .
has he been gone long ?
since lunch .
gee whiz , and i' m late .
he was expecting you ?
15 minutes ago .
i' il go in and wait .
sir !
could i help you ?
russ yelburton , deputy chief .
j. j. gittes .
it' s not a departmental matter .
would you care to wait in my office ?
certainly .
we' re a bit nervous , with all this business in the papers
about mr mulwray .
right this way .
after you' ve worked with a man for a certain length of time ,
you come to know his habits and values .
either he' s the kind who chases after women , or he isn' t .
mulwray never even kids about it .
maybe he takes it very seriously .
sit down .
no , thank you .
where is he having lunch ?
i' m sorry , i don' t know .
well , tell him i' il be back .
i will .
do you mind if i take one of your cards , in case i have to get in touch with you ?
mulvihill , what are you doing here ?
they shut my water off .
so what ?
how' d you find out ?
you don' t drink it , you don' t take a bath in it ...
they wrote you a letter ...
but then you' d have to be able to read .
relax , glad to see you .
do you know claude mulvihill ?
i hope so , he' s working for us .
doing what ?
there' s been threats to the reservoirs .
any particular reason ?
rationing .
the farmers are desperate .
but the city needs drinking water .
well , you' re in luck .
when he was sheriff , the rum runners landed tons of booze on the beach
and never lost a drop .
he ought to be able to hold on to your water for you .
j. j. gittes to see mr mulwray .
please .
you wait .
bad for glass .
yeah , sure .
bad for the glass .
mr gittes .
actually , i came to see your husband .
something to drink ? .
what are you having ?
iced tea .
that' il be fine , thank you .
my husband' s at the office .
actually , he' s not .
and he' s checked out of his apartment at the ei macondo .
that' s not his apartment .
anyway , the point is , i' m not in business to be loved ,
but i am in business .
whoever set your husband up , set me up .
l. a. is a small town .
people talk .
i don' t want to become a local joke .
you' ve talked me into it .
i' il drop the lawsuit .
what ?
let' s just drop the whole thing .
sugar , lemon , or both ?
both ...
i don' t want to drop it .
i better talk to your husband .
why ? .
hollis seems to think you' re an innocent man .
i' ve been accused of a lot of things , but never that .
someone' s gone to a lot of trouble , and i intend to find out .
i' m not supposed to be the one caught with his pants down .
unless it' s a problem , i' d like to talk to your husband .
may i speak frankly , mrs mulwray ? .
you may if you can , mr gittes .
that little girlfriend .
she was pretty , in a cheap sort of way , of course ...
she' s disappeared .
maybe they disappeared together .
if they did , how does that affect you ?
it' s nothing personal .
it' s very personal .
it couldn' t be more personal .
is this an obsession with you ?
let' s look at it this way ...
this phoney broad , excuse the language , tells me she' s you .
whoever put her up to it isn' t after me , they' re out to get your husband .
if i can see him , i can help him .
did you talk to him this morning ?
no .
i went riding rather early .
it looks like you went quite a distance .
i was riding bareback .
you might try the oak pass or the stone canyon reservoir .
he often takes walks .
otherwise he' il be home by 6 : 30 .
i' il stop by .
please call first .
sorry , closed to public .
that' s all right , officer ...
russ yelburton , deputy chief of the department .
sorry , mr yelburton .
go on down .
gittes , get out before he sees you .
loach , what' s going on ?
hello , jake .
lou .
how are you ?
lousy cold i can' t seem to shake , but otherwise i' m okay .
summer colds are the worst .
yeah , they are .
there' s no smoking here .
we' il make an exception this time .
i' il see he' s careful with the matches and doesn' t burn himself .
how' d you get past the guard ?
to tell you the truth , i lied a little .
you look like you' ve done well .
i get by .
sometimes it takes a man a while to find himself .
maybe you have .
yeah , going through other people' s dirty linen .
tell me , you still putting chinamen in jail for spitting in the laundry ? .
you' re a little behind the times .
they use steam irons now .
and i' m out of chinatown .
since when ?
since i made lieutenant .
congratulations .
what are you doing around here ?
i' m looking for somebody .
hollis mulwray .
you seen him ?
yeah .
i' d like to talk to him .
you' d like to talk to him ...
you' re welcome to try .
there he is .
it looks like he was washed down the entire length of the run off channel .
could he swim ?
of course .
obviously , the fall must have knocked him unconscious .
mrs mulwray , this alleged affair your husband was having ...
the publicity didn' t make him morose or unhappy ? .
it didn' t make him happy .
he couldn' t have taken his own life ?
no .
do you happen to know the name of the young lady in question ?
no .
or where she might be ?
you and your husband never discussed her ? .
we did .
he wouldn' t tell me her name .
we quarrelled over her , of course .
it came as a complete surprise to me .
a complete surprise ?
i thought you hired a private investigator .
a private investigator ? .
mr gittes .
yes , but i did that to put an end to a ridiculous rumour that had no basis .
when did mr gittes inform you that the rumours had some foundation in fact ?
just before the story broke in the papers .
you wouldn' t happen to know where i could find her ... or her name ?
no .
of course not .
will you need me for anything else ?
no , i don' t think so .
if we need any more information we' il be in touch .
of course you have my deepest sympathy .
i' il see her to the car , lou .
i' il be right back .
jake , what' s the story ? .
take it easy .
we better do this in a hurry ...
give us a little room !
you want a picture , guys ?
here it is .
gittes " , two ts and an e.
thank you for going along with me back there .
i just didn' t want to explain anything .
i' il send you a check .
a check ? .
to make it official that i' ve hired you .
i' il have it this afternoon ...
jake , what are you doing here ?
it' s my lunch hour , morty .
i thought i' d drop by and see who' d dropped dead .
middle of a drought , and the water commissioner drowns .
only in l. a. looks pretty banged up .
well , it' s a long fall .
so how are you doing , morty ? .
never better , except for this cough .
you know me , jake .
yeah .
so who have you got there ?
leroy shuhardt .
local drunk .
used to hang around ferguson' s alley .
quite a character .
lately he' s been living in a downtown storm drain .
had a bureau dresser down there and everything .
he drowned too .
come again ?
got drunk .
passed out in the riverbed .
the l. a. river ? .
yeah , what' s wrong with that ?
it' s dry as a bone .
it' s not completely dry .
he ain' t gonna drown in a damp riverbed , no matter how soused he is .
we got water out of him .
he drowned .
hello .
howdy .
you were riding out here the other day , weren' t you ?
do you speak english ?
habla lngles ?
si .
you were talking to a man a few days ago .
he wore glasses ...
what did you talk about ?
the water .
what about the water ? .
when it comes .
what did you tell him ?
it comes in different parts of the river .
every night a different part .
son of a bitch .
goddam florsheim shoe .
hold it there , kitty cat .
hello , claude .
where' d you get the midget ?
you' re a very nosy fellow .
know what happens to nosy fellows ?
no ?
wanna guess ?
no ?
okay .
they lose their noses .
next time you lose the whole thing .
i' il cut it off and feed it to my goldfish .
understand ?
understand ?
i understand .
so a contractor wants to build a dam and makes a few pay offs .
so what ?
you can' t nail mulvihill .
they' il claim you were trespassing .
i don' t want mulvihill .
i want the big boys that are making the pay offs .
then what' il you do ?
sue the shit out of them .
what is it , sophie ?
a miss sessions is calling .
who ?
ida sessions .
don' t know her .
take a number .
people like that will be having dinner with the judge who' s trying the suit .
i' m sorry .
miss sessions insists .
she says you know her .
okay .
hello , miss sessions .
i don' t believe we' ve had the pleasure .
oh yes we have .
are you alone ?
isn' t everyone ?
what can i do for you ?
well , i' m a working girl .
i didn' t come in to see you on my own .
when did you come in ?
ipretended to be mrs mulwray .
shut the fuck up ...
yes , i remember .
is something wrong ?
i was just checking with an associate .
go on .
i never expected all this to happen .
ifitgets out , i wantsomeone to know thatl didn' t know what would happen .
i understand .
who was your employer ? .
it would be helpful to both of us .
oh , no .
no .
what' s your address ?
maybe we could talk this over .
justlook in the obituary column oftoday' s l. a. post record .
you' il find one ofthose people .
sure ...
how do you like them apples ?
thank you for coming .
yes , sir ? .
drink ? .
tom collins with lime , not lemon .
i got your check in the mail .
as i said , i was very grateful .
i' m afraid that' s not good enough .
how much would you like ?
oh , stop it .
the money' s fine .
but i think you short changed me on the story .
something else besides the death of your husband was bothering you .
you were upset , but not that upset .
don' t tell me how i feel .
sorry .
you sue me , your husband dies , you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato .
all of it quicker than the wind from a duck' s ass .
excuse me ...
then you ask me to lie to the police .
it wasn' t much of a lie .
if he was killed , it was .
this could look like a pay off to withhold evidence .
but he wasn' t killed .
mrs mulwray , i think you' re hiding something .
i suppose i am .
actually , i knew about the affair .
how did you find out ?
my husband .
he told you ?
and you weren' t in the least bit upset ?
i was grateful .
you' il have to explain that .
why ? .
when a wife tells me she' s happy that her husband is cheating on her ,
it runs contrary to my experience .
unless what ?
she was cheating on him .
were you ?
i dislike the word " cheat " .
did you have affairs ?
did he know about it ?
i wouldn' t run home and tell him whenever i' d been to bed with another .
anything else you want to know ? .
where were you when hollis died ?
i can' t tell you .
you don' t know ? .
i can' t tell you .
you were seeing someone too .
for very long ?
i don' t see anyone for very long .
it' s difficult for me .
now , i think you know all you need know about me .
i didn' t want publicity .
i didn' t want to go into all of this then , or now .
is that all ?
oh , by the way ...
what does this " c " stand for ? .
cross .
that' s your maiden name ?
yes .
why ? .
no reason .
you must have had a reason to ask .
no , i' m just a snoop .
no , i have my own car .
the packard .
wait a minute , sonny .
i think you better come with me .
there' s nothing more to say .
get my car , please .
okay , but in case you' re interested , your husband was murdered .
someone' s been dumping thousands of tons of water from the reservoirs ,
and we' re supposedly in a drought .
he found out about it and he was killed .
there' s a drowned drunk .
involuntary manslaughter , if anyone took the time .
it seems like half the city is trying to cover it up , which is fine by me ,
but i goddam near lost my nose .
and i like it .
i like breathing through it .
and i still think that you' re hiding something .
mr gittes ...
j. j. gittes to see mr yelburton .
mr yelburton will be busy for some time .
well , it' s my lunch hour .
i can wait .
he' s liable to be tied up indefinitely .
i take a long lunch hour .
all day , sometimes .
noah cross worked for the company ? .
yes ...
no .
did he or didn' t he ?
he owned it .
he owned the water department ?
yes .
you mean , he owned the entire water supply for the city ? .
how' d they get it away from him ?
mulwray felt the public should own it .
mr mulwray ? .
i thought you said cross owned it .
along with mr mulwray .
they were partners ?
yes , they were partners .
mr yelburton will see you now .
mr gittes , sorry to keep you waiting .
these staff meetings just go on and on .
it must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances .
yes , hollis was the best department chief the city ever had .
what happened to your nose ?
cut myself shaving .
that must really smart .
only when i breathe .
only when you breathe ...
don' t tell me you' re still working for mrs mulwray ? .
i never was .
i don' t understand .
neither do i , actually .
you hired me .
or you hired that chippie to hire me .
you' re not making a bit of sense .
mulwray didn' t want to build a dam .
his reputation was hard to get around .
you decided to ruin it .
then he found out you were dumping water at night .
then he was ... drowned .
that' s an outrageous accusation .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
well , whitey mehrholtz over at the times will .
dumping thousands of gallons of water in the middle of a drought is news .
mr gittes ...
we' re not anxious for it to get around , but we have been diverting water
to irrigate orange groves in the northwest valley .
they have no legal right to our water , but we' ve been trying to help them out .
when you divert water , there' s a little run off .
yeah , a little run off ...
where did you say those groves were ?
in the northwest valley .
that' s like saying they' re in arizona .
my field men are out , i can' t give you the exact location .
you' re a married man , aren' t you ?
hard working , wife , kids .. ?
yes .
i don' t want to nail you .
i want to find out who put you up to it .
i' il give you a few days to think on it .
call me , i can help .
who knows , maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big shots , and you can stay head of the department for 20 years .
drink ? .
no , thank you .
what is your usual salary ? .
$35 a day , plus 20 for my associates .
plus expenses , plus a bonus if i show results .
whoever killed my husband , why have they gone to all this trouble ?
money .
how they plan to make it emptying reservoirs , i don' t know .
i' il pay your salary , plus $5, 000 ,
if you find out what happened to hollis , and who is involved .
sophie , draw up one of our standard contracts for mrs mulwray .
were you married before mulwray and your father sold the water department ?
noah cross is your father , isn' t he ?
yes , of course .
it was sometime after .
i was just out of grade school when they did that .
then you married your father' s business partner .
you' ve already got one going .
does my talking about your father upset you ?
no ...
yes , a little .
you see , hollis and my fa ... ... my father had a falling out , finally .
over you or the water department ?
why should it be over me ?
then it was over the water department .
hollis felt the water should belong to the public .
i think my father disagreed .
actually , it was over the van der lip dam .
the dam that broke .
hollis never forgave him for it .
never forgave him for what ?
for talking him into building it .
they never spoke from that time on .
you sure about that ?
of course i' m sure .
sign here .
the copy' s for you .
mr gittes ?
how do you do ?
you got a nasty reputation .
i like that .
thanks .
you' re not a bank president .
in your business it' s good advertising .
it doesn' t hurt .
it helps get a client like my daughter .
probably .
i' m surprised you still work for her .
unless she' s suddenly come up with another husband .
she happens to think the last one was murdered .
how did she get that idea ?
i think i gave it to her .
i hope you don' t mind .
i believe they should be served with the head .
as long as you don' t serve the chicken that way .
tell me , what do the police say ? .
they' re calling it an accident .
who' s the investigating officer ? .
lt. lou escobar .
you know him ?
oh , yeah .
where from ?
we worked together , in chinatown .
would you call him a capable man ?
very .
honest ?
as far as it goes .
he has to swim in the same water we all do .
but there' s no reason to think he' s bungled the case ?
too bad .
too bad ?
it makes me think you' re taking my daughter for a ride ,
financially speaking , of course .
what are you charging her ? .
my usual fee , plus a bonus if i get results .
are you sleeping with her ? .
you have to think about that to remember ? .
if you want an answer to that question , i' il put one of my men on the job .
good afternoon .
mr gittes ...
she' s just lost her husband .
i don' t want her taken advantage of .
sit down .
what for ? .
you may think you know what you' re dealing with , but believe me , you don' t .
why is that funny ? .
the da used to say that in chinatown .
was he right ?
exactly what do you know about me ?
sit down .
you' re rich , and too respectable to want your name in the newspapers .
of course i' m respectable .
i' m old .
politicians , ugly buildings and whores get respectable if they last a long time .
i' il double your fee and pay you $10 000 if you find hollis' s girlfriend .
girlfriend ?
disappeared , hasn' t she ?
wouldn' t it be useful to talk to her ? .
maybe .
if he was murdered , she may be the last to see him alive .
when was the last time you saw him ?
sheriff' s gold posse .
damn fools .
they paid $5, 000 apiece toward the sheriff' s re election .
i let them practice up here .
do you know when you last saw him ?
at my age you tend to forget .
five days ago , at the pig & whistle .
you had one hell of an argument .
i got the pictures in my office , if that' il help you remember .
what did you argue about ?
my daughter .
what about her ? .
just find the girl , mr gittes .
i know hollis was fond of her .
i' d like to help her if i can .
i had no idea you and hollis were that fond of one another .
hollis mulwray made this city , and he made me a fortune .
we were a lot closer than evelyn realised .
if you want to hire me , i still have to know what the argument was about .
my daughter' s veryjealous .
i didn' t want her to find out about the girl .
how did you find out ?
i' ve still got a few friends in town .
okay ...
i' il have my secretary draw up the papers .
are you frightened for the girl or what evelyn might do to her ? .
just find the girl .
i' il look into it , as soon as i' ve checked out some orange groves .
orange groves ?
we' il be in touch , mr cross .
could you tell me where the plat books for the northwest valley are ?
part of it' s in ventura county .
we don' t have them in our hall of records .
then i' il settle for l. a. county .
row 23 , section c.
weasel .
sonny , why do they have all those names pasted in the plat books ?
land sales out of escrow are recorded within the week .
then these are all new owners ?
that' s right .
that means that most of the valley' s sold in the last few months .
can i check one of these volumes out ?
this is not a lending library , it' s the hall of records .
how about a ruler ? .
a ruler ? .
the print' s fine , and i left my glasses at home .
i' d like to be able to read across .
i thank you .
hold it right there !
all right , quit it now !
search the man , see if he' s armed .
i didn' t tell you to empty his pockets .
search him !
he ain' t armed .
who are you with , the water department or the real estate office ?
get away from me !
come near me with that again , you' il need a pair of them !
pick on somebody your own size .
give him a chance to say something .
the name' s gittes , private investigator .
i' m not with either one of them .
what are you doing out here ?
a client hired me to see if the water department was irrigating your land .
the water dept . ' s been sending people out here to blow up my water tanks .
they put poison in my wells .
that' s a funny way to irrigate .
who' d hire you for a thing like that ?
mrs evelyn mulwray .
that' s the one who' s done it to us .
mulwray' s dead .
you don' t know what you' re talking about , you dumb okie .
well , that' s that .
what' s going on ?
you didn' t look good .
we thought we better call your employer .
thanks for coming .
that dam your husband opposed is a con job .
they' re conning l. a. into building it , but the water' s coming here , not to l. a.
everything you can see .
all around us .
i was at the hall of records today .
in the last three months , robert knox has bought 7, 000 acres .
12 000 .
5, 000 .
25, 000 acres .
jasper lamar crabb ?
i think i would have remembered that name .
they' re blowing the farmers out and then buying their land for peanuts .
you know what this land would be worth with a steady water supply ? .
about 30 million more than they paid for it .
hollis knew about this ?
that' s why he was killed .
jasper lamar crabb ...
we got it .
what is it ?
a memorial was held at the mar vista lnn for jasper lamar crabb .
he passed away two weeks ago .
is that unusual ?
he passed away two weeks ago .
one week ago he bought the land .
that' s unusual .
hello , i' m mr palmer .
can i help you folks ?
yes , i hope so .
it' s dad .
i can' t handle him anymore .
my goodness .
it' s nothing with dad , it' s me .
dad' s an angel with everyone else .
but when he and my h ...
i don' t know .
of course , i' m anxious for him to have the best .
money is no object .
perhaps if we met with your father .
there is one question ...
do you accept people of the jewish persuasion ?
i' m sorry , but we don' t .
neither does dad .
we had to be sure .
would it be possible to see a list of your patients , just to be certain ?
we never reveal the names of our guests .
it' s policy .
you' d agree if your father lived here .
exactly what i wanted to hear you say .
is it too late for us to look around ?
no , allow me to show you .
could we stroll on our own ?
yes , if you stay in the main building .
it' s almost bedtime .
we understand .
come , my sweet .
charley , you ought to know better than that .
they' re all there .
every goddam name .
you' re looking at the owners of a 50 000 acre empire .
they may not know it , but they are .
hello , girls .
are any of you emma dill ?
are you emma ?
i' ve wanted to meet you a long time .
why ? .
did you know you were very wealthy ? .
i' m not .
you own a lot of land .

some time ago , my late husband owned a lot of beach property ,
but we lost it .
that' s very beautiful .
where did you get this piece of material ?
at the albacore club .
albacore .
it' s a fish .
my grandson is a member .
they take very nice care of us .
how do they do that ?
give us things .
not just a flag , but ...
but what ?
we' re an unofficial charity to them .
would you come with me ?
someone wants to talk with you .
goodbye , ladies .
i want you to meet someone , gittes .
can we leave the lady out of this ?
yeah , why not .
i' d like to see her to the car .
she knows where it' s at .
i' il stay .
get in the car .
maid' s night off ?
why ? .
because nobody' s here , that' s why .
i gave everyone the night off .
easy , it' s an innocent question .
no question from you is innocent .
i guess you' re right .
to you , mrs mulwray .
frankly , tonight you saved my a ... you saved my neck .
tell me , mr gittes , does this often happen to you ?
what' s that ?
i' m judging only on part of today , but if this is how you go about your work ,
i' d say you' d be lucky to get through a whole day .
this hasn' t happened for a long time .
when was the last time ?
why ? .
it' s an innocent question .
in chinatown .
what were you doing there ?
working for the district attorney .
doing what ?
as little as possible .
the da gives you advice like that ?
they do in chinatown .
why did you leave the police force ?
do you have any peroxide , or anything like that ?
surely .
come this way .
god !
that' s a nasty cut .
i had no idea .
sorry !
is it painful ?
it must be painful .
what' s wrong ?
your eye .
what about it ?
there' s something black in the green part of your eye .
oh , that .
it' s a flaw in the iris .
a flaw ? .
yes , it' s a sort of birthmark .
did you wear a uniform ?
sometimes .
you must have looked cute in blue .
give me a break , will you ?
i want to know more about you .
not now .
you really don' t like to talk about the past , do you ?
i' m tired .
why does it bother you to talk of it ?
it bothers everybody who works there .
where ?
chinatown .
everybody .
to me it was just bad luck .
why ? .
you can' t always tell what' s going on .
like with you .
why was ...
why was it bad luck ? .
i was trying to keep someone from being hurt .
i ended up making sure that she was hurt .
cherchez la femme .
was there a woman involved ?
of course .
dead ?
yes , hello ?
oh , my god !
don' t do anything .
don' t do anything until i get there .
i have to go .
where ?
it' s just that i have to .
i want to know where you' re going .
don' t be angry .
it has nothing to do with you or any of this .
where are you going ?
please ...
trust me this much .
i' il be back .
there is something that i should tell you
about the fishing club that old lady mentioned .
the albacore club .
it has to do with my father .
i know .
he owns it ...
you know ? .
i saw him .
you saw ... my father ? .
when ?
this morning .
you didn' t tell me .
well , there hasn' t been much time .
what did he say ? .
what did he say ? .
that you were jealous .
that he was afraid what you might do .
to whom ?
mulwray' s girlfriend , for one .
he wanted to know where she was .
i want you to listen to me .
my father is a very dangerous man .
you don' t know how dangerous .
you don' t know how crazy .
are you trying to tell me that he might be behind all of this ?
it' s possible .
even the death of your husband ?
it' s possible .
now please , don' t ask me any more questions .
just wait for me here .
i need you here .
give me the keys .
you .. !
it' s either that or you drive yourself to the police .
come on , mrs mulwray .
you have your husband' s girlfriend tied up in there .
she' s not tied up .
you' re holding her against her will .
i am not .
okay , then let' s go talk to her .
no !
she' s too upset .
what about ?
hollis' s death .
i tried to keep it from her until i could make plans for us to leave .
she just found out about it ?
that' s not what it looks like .
what does it look like ?
like she knows more than you want her to tell .
you' re insane .
tell me the truth .
i' m not the police .
i don' t care what you' ve done .
i don' t want to hurt you .
you won' t go to the police if i tell you ?
i will if you don' t .
she' s my sister .
take it easy .
if she' s your sister , she' s your sister .
why all the secrecy ? .
i can' t ...
is it because she was seeing your husband ? ls that it ?
i' d never have harmed hollis .
he was the most gentle , decent man imaginable .
and he put up with more from me than you' il ever know .
i wanted him to be happy .
i borrowed your husband' s car .
i' il bring it back in the morning .
aren' t you coming back with me ?
don' t worry , i won' t tell anybody .
that' s not what i meant .
yeah , well ...

mulwray had salt water in his lungs .
you tailed him day and night .

you accuse me of extortion ?
you' re dumber than you think i think you are .
i wouldn' t extort a nickel from my worst enemy .
i want the pictures .
accessory after the fact , conspiracy and extortion .
you think evelyn killed her husband in the ocean ,
then dragged him up to a reservoir to make it look more like an accident ?
he was moved because somebody didn' t want his body found in the ocean .
he found out they were dumping water and trying to cover it up .
what the hell are you talking about ?

let' s get a warrant for her arrest .
what are we waiting for ? .
he just made lieutenant .
he wants to hang on to his little gold bar .

i found these in your backyard , in the pond .
they belonged to your husband , didn' t they ? .
i don' t know .
yes , probably .
positively .
he was drowned there .

there' s no time to be shocked .
the coroner proved he had salt water in his lungs when he was killed .
i want to know how it happened , and why ,
before escobar gets here .
i don' t want to lose my license .
i don' t know what you are talking about .
this is the craziest ...
stop it !
i want to make it easy for you .
you were jealous , you had a fight .
he hit his head .
it was an accident .
but his girl is a witness .
so you had to shut her up , and you had the money to do it .

no !
who is she ?
she' s not your sister , you don' t have one .
i' il tell you the truth .

she knows something' s up .
what' s the maid' s address ?
she lives in pedro .
i' il write it down ...

because if she ain' t there , you' re gonna stay downtown until she does show up .
gee lou , i' m doing the best i can .
tell us about it on the way to san pedro .
let' s get the little lady .
can i ask you a favour ? .
i' d like to bring her out myself .
she' s not armed , she won' t be a problem .
i just want a minute alone with her .
it would mean a lot to her , and to me .
you never learn , do you , jake ?
i guess not .
okay ...
i' il give you three minutes .
just three minutes .
gee , thanks , lou .
hello .
mr gittes , come in !
this is some surprise .

but i' d like a glass of water .
come out in the kitchen with me .
curly , where' s your car ? .
in the garage off the alley .
can you give me a ride somewhere .. ?
right now .
it can' t wait .
i' il tell my wife .
tell her later , curl .
just drive slow for a block or two .
what' s this all about ?
i' il tell you in a block or two .
how much do you owe me ?
gee , we' re going out tomorrow .
you' ve been good about it , but my cousin' s sick .
how would you like to pay me off by taking two passengers to encenada ?
you' d have to leave tonight .
i don' t know .
i might be able to squeeze 75 bucks out of it for you .
maybe even 100 .
plus what i owe ?
i' il throw that in too .
1 712 alameda .
wait for me until 8 : 30 .
if i don' t show , take them to your boat .
you' re sure this is okay ? .
do you know how long i' ve been in this business ?
have you got your checkbook handy , mr cross ?
i' ve got the girl .
you' ve gother ?
where ?
remember the figures we discussed ?
yes .
where are you ?
your daughter' s house .
how soon can you get here ?
an hour .
there you are !
well , you don' t look too much the worse for wear .
where' s the girl ? ls she all right ?
she' s fine .
well , where is she ?
with her mother .
i' ve got something i' d like to show you .
what is it ?
an obituary column .
can you see all right in this light ?
i guess i can manage .
what does it mean ?
that you killed hollis mulwray .
right here .
in that pond .
you drowned him , and you left these .
the coroner' s report shows mulwray had salt water in his lungs .
hollis was always fascinated by tide pools .
you know what he used to say ? .
i haven' t the faintest idea .
that' s where life begins , tide pools !
he figured that if you dumped water into the desert sand
and let it percolate down to the bedrock ,
it wouldn' t evaporate the way it does in reservoirs .
you lose 20/ o , not 80/ o .
he made this city !
you were gonna do that in the valley ? .
i am doing it .
when the bond issue passes tuesday
there will be eight million dollars to build a reservoir .
people will be mad when they find out they' re paying for water they won' t get .
that' s all taken care of .
you see ,
either you bring the water to l. a. or you bring l. a. to the water .
how are you gonna do that ?
i' il incorporate the valley into the city .
how much are you worth ?
how much do you want ?
are you worth over ten million ?
oh , yes .
why are you doing it ?
what can you buy that you can' t already afford ?
the future , mr gittes .
the future .
now where' s the girl ?
i want the only daughter i' ve got left .
as you now , evelyn was lost to me a long time ago .
who do you blame for that ?
her ? .
i don' t blame myself .
most people never have to face the fact
that at the right time and the right place , they' re capable of anything .
claude , take those glasses from him .
not worth it , mr gittes .
it' s really not worth it .
take us to the girl .
you remember night train claude mulvihill ?
these are my associates ...
you' re under arrest , jake .
good news .
withholding evidence , extortion , accessory after the fact .
i didn' t extort nothing from nobody .
this is noah cross .
evelyn' s father .
he' s the bird you' re after .
i can explain everything in five minutes .
he' s rich !
he thinks he can get away with it .
you shut up , or i' il lock you up .
i am rich , i am noah cross .
evelyn mulwray is my daughter .
he' s crazy , lou !
he killed mulwray because of the water thing .
just listen !
lock him to the wheel of the car .
you don' t know what' s going on here .
katherine !
i am your grandfather , my dear .
i am your grandfather .
no , go on .
i' il follow you .
get away from her .
get away !
evelyn , please ... be reasonable .
come to my ...
get away from her !
how many years have i got ?
she' s mine , too .
she' s never going to know that .
you' re a disturbed woman .
you cannot provide ...
evelyn , let the police handle this .
he owns the police !
get away from her .
you' il have to kill me first .
close the door .
halt !
get the captain .
get an ambulance .
turn them all loose .
lord ...
oh , lord !
as little as possible .
what' s that ?
what' s that ?
you wanna do your partner a big favour ? .
take him home .
take him home .
just get him the hell out of here !
go home , jake .
i' m doing you a favour .
come on , jake .
forget it , jake .
it' s chinatown .
all right , clear the area !
on the sidewalk .
on the sidewalk !
get off the street !
get off the street !
