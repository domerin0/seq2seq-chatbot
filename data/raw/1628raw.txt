enjoy your hours !
grandfather .
this is for my family .
an excellent harvest , tsering .
how long do you think it will feed us ?
a very long time .
a lifetime .
with all this we can' t even feed the village for three months .
look grandfather , it' s the caravan .
the caravan .
lhakpa .
tinle , your son has died .
he wanted to take a different route .
he said it was a one day shortcut .
i told him it was dangerous but he wouldn' t listen .
a couple of hours later i found him .
dead .
this salt has been mixed with sand .
what are you waiting for ?
take him off .
well ?
tsering , i told you ... your father will be reborn in the kingdom padmasambhava .
when ?
it' il take a while for him to get there .
he must fly over hell before he reaches buddha' s paradise .
everyone will have to die in the end .
for how long will we stay dead ?
all that lives has to die .
it is reborn again and dies again too .
how many lives does it take to become a leader ?
we have been leaders for a very long time .
you will be next .
will you teach me what to do ?
thank you .
lhakpa defied the mountains .
the mountains haven' t done anything to him .
i know them very well .
you do , but lhakpa doesn' t .
he is my son .
he has inherited my forces .
your pride and persistance is what you mean .
you don' t know anything .
karma lied .
he has caused that accident because he wants to be the leader .
i know what i' m saying .
who will bring us the salt now ?
and what about the wheat ?
who will be taking care of the yaks ?
no leader , no land .
no woman , no husband .
my son without a father .
this is not our lucky day .
let' s try again .
this time i' il hit the target .
karma , i have no luck today .
you take the shot .
i will make a wish for you .
the gods triumph .
thanks to you my child will live .
you have shattered the heart of the evil spirit .
the evil spirit has died , but your daughter isn' t safe yet .
get the doctor over here .
i have more faith in you .
i' ve been looking everywhere .
karma' s hit the target .
ask him to teach me how to shoot .
come on let' s go home .
who will teach me now ?
don' t worry , you' re still young .
but i will become the next leader .
with daddy' s bow .
i' ve thrown it into the river .
don' t cry .
that was a lie .
it' s in the house .
it' s yours now .
karma was lhakpa' s right hand man .
he is the one that should be leader .
he is experienced .
he has the strength and knowledge it takes .
i will be leading the caravan .
i' ve done it a thousand times before .
lhakpa is dead .
his son tsering should take over .
he is going alright .
it' il take years before he makes a good leader .
the gods are on my side .
tinle , we have faith in you and in your experience .
but your legs they' re not what they used to be .
i will take a strong man with me .
he will be my support .
karma would be best .
karma is a traitor .
he isn' t to blame for the murder of past generations .
they killed my grandfather .
and now they' ve killed my son .
it was an accident .
karma didn' t do it .
nonsense .
kharma was chosen by the council .
the council is me .
you wouldn' t be here if it wasn' t for me .
tinle , there is no time to find a better man .
lama , what have you decided ?
the fifteenth constellation .
the thirteenth day , monday , the fifteenth constellation .
let me have a look .
the thirteenth day ... well ?
when do we leave ?
be patient .
it' s always the same .
you are putting our lives at stake with those calculations of yours .
the twelfth or thirteenth day .
be patient .
we were doing it this way already before you were born .
the thirteenth day , the fifteenth constellation .
this is the best day .
snow storms don' t wait .
the fifteenth constellation ?
isn' t that later ?
that' s settled then .
is it this day ?
monday , the fifteenth constellation ...
i can' t help you tinle .
a bag of salt doesn' t change anything .
it would be treachery if i took your offer .
go to karma .
he' s the best .
you and your ' karma ' .
karma this ...
karma that .
he will lead you into death .
you' re out of your mind .
you' re wrong , tinle .
karma tried to save lhakpa .
karma can drop dead .
he wants to take my place .
you' re all trying to set me up .
doesn' t my beer taste good , rabkie ?
it does , just don' t let your husband drink too much .
tinle , let' s call for a truce .
you will need me .
you will not find anyone else .
i don' t need you .
why are you treating me like this ?
lhakpa was my friend .
i forbid you to say his name .
the mountains have seen everything .
i will lead the caravan .
alone you will .
no one is going with you .
you haven' t done this in years .
they will accept me .
i was their leader before you were even born .
tsering will be my successor before you die .
your hate will not help your sorrow , tinle .
the lama' s have concluded on the day of departure .
we lave in ten days .
grandfather .
who will take our yaks ?
grandfather , what is wrong ?
don' t worry .
we' il find someone .
there' s still ten days left .
are you ignoring me ?
we must obey the gods .
you don' t belong in the mountains anymore .
my son has died in there .
we can' t help you .
don' t force us to say no .
grandfather .
why do they refuse to help you ?
it' s not easy to take your father' s place .
have you forgotten the way home ?
it' s been a while indeed .
every time you want to change your destiny you come to me .
come here , boy .
from now on you will be called pasang .
my name is tsering .
from now on you' re pasang .
the lama' s have called me tsering .
evil spirits are on their way .
they' re jealous at us .
we have a lot of yaks .
if we give you a blacksmith' s name they will not harm you .
your father is dead .
it is your task to replace him .
i will help you .
what are you doing , karma ?
i' m leaving .
now ?
you can' t leave now .
winter is coming .
do you believe in those calculations ?
it is the gods .
they can say whatever they want .
are you leaving all by yourself ?
me and my yaks .
join me .
my father would kill me .
who' s carrying the salt ?
you or your father ?
he is too old .
we' il join tinle .
yeah , tinle .
speaking of young men .
come here .
take tinle to norbou .
grandfather tinle , come with me .
is this color right ?
the blue isn' t as clear as it was yesterday .
watch closely .
we' il never finish this in time .
that is up to the gods .
we do not determine when we' re done .
we have no influence on it .
the fresco knows when it is done .
what is it ?
why are you here ?
norbou ...
father .
karma , teach me how to use the bow .
first you have to get strong arms .
it' s very important .
do you understand ?
come .
we leave tomorrow morning .
come with me .
but it' s before the set date !
there will be snowstorms soon .
you want to leave before tinle don' t you ?
let' s go together .
come on , tinle can' t do this on his own .
i wanted to join forces but he refused .
you ask him .
where is he ?
he' s in the monastery .
he' s getting norbou .
why would he do that ?
he doesn' t know what he' s doing .
he' s nothing but grief .
and what' s tormenting you ?
it is impossible .
karma was my brother' s best friend .
yes , but things have changed .
your brother is dead and i can' t look after the yaks alone .
will you lead the caravan ?
i have no other choice .
why ?
choose someone else .
this man is you , my second son .
i don' t know anything about the mountains , the yaks or the salt .
you' il learn .
no .
i' ve been here since i was eight years old .
i can read , know how to pray and paint .
you wanted me to become a lama .
i am no man to lead a caravan .
you have enough clothes and food .
we don' t .
you sent me here as a kid .
and now you want to send me off into the mountains .
you are afraid .
not afraid enough to refuse .
you are no longer lhakpa' s brother .
say your prayers if that is all you can do .
i' il bring tsering along .
he at least isn' t afraid .
do we leave tomorrow ?
go to sleep .
it' il be a long journey .
my wife wants to say goodbye tonight .
enjoy it .
pema .
are you there ?
do you remember ?
our hideout when we were kids .
did you call me just for that ?
you can' t leave .
not before tinle has returned .
why not ?
it is tinle' s law .
no , it' s the dolpo' s .
tinle isn' t the dolpo .
he will take the decisions for himself , you and the others .
pema .
go into mourning .
come with us .
and bring tsering .
we will add your yaks to the troop .
what will you do if you can' t sell the salt ?
tinle will return .
tinle is old .
he can' t think straight anymore .
i' m not going with you .
pema , i leave tomorrow at dawn .
are you ready ?
hurry up .
we' re ready .
come .
i' m ready too .
so are we .
let' s go .
karma , your father .
karma , all our sons leave together with you .
i didn' t force anyone to come with me .
i can' t support tinle .
i wanted you as our leader , but not like that .
i have no other choice .
if you go sooner the gods will be against you .
you will be banished from the dolpo .
i am taking the dolpo with me .
you are no longer part of this .
tinle has returned .
do you see my son ?
no .
i see tinle .
norbou isn' t with him .
what' s happened ?
are you alone ?
why ?
everyone' s here .
karma and the others have left .
where is the salt ?
i' ve got mine .
me too .
my sons have all my salt .
what are they doing with our salt ?
same as always .
we' re leaving on the set date .
tinle , we' re too old .
i see a couple of tough and cooperative men .
chopga , paljor , tensing , we' il make it together .
tinle , it' s been years .
we can' t do this anymore .
the gods are on our side , the mountains our allies .
in here we will die of embarrassment .
tinle' s right .
karma .
you did it .
we did this together .
long live karma .
we' il go , just like in the old days ...
my old ngeunpo .
we' il show them .
father , there is another bag inside .
do you need it ?
yes , bring it to me .
pasang , stop that , for christ' s sake .
the salt .
quick .
we must not waste it .
hurry .
lama norbou .
what are you doing here ?
go home .
my son is a member of the caravan now .
this one isn' t properly attached .
it' s going to fall off if you' re not careful .
give me a hand .
tie a knot in it .
come on .
the blessing will be later .
first we get this knot right .
is it ok now ?
yes it' il do .
put your boots on , boy .
don' t worry .
winter is coming .
you are all old men .
what if it' s going to snow ?
don' t worry .
pasang will be fine .
we' il take good care of our child .
but you' re the child .
hurry up .
move it .
come on .
move .
tinle .
we haven' t been here for so long .
you can say that again .
i' m exhausted .
are you my father' s brother ? yes .
do i look like you imagined ?
father says you have been locked up for years .
a monastery is not a prison .
you weren' t locked up ?
when you say your prayers the soul leaves the body .
this is pure freedom .
where does it leave the body then ?
the yaks are gone .
old ngeunpo , run like in the old days .
go .
easy , you' re scaring them .
don' t wave your arms and legs like that .
feel the rhythm of the yaks .
don' t make any sudden moves .
if you pray to the gods like this you' il scare them .
aren' t you tired ?
i' m okay .
i' ve heard you' re a good painter .
no , but my frescoes are good .
my father hasn' t changed a bit .
when he screams , man and animal bow their heads and walk past .
but where to ?
there they are , back there .
what' s happened ?
suddenly he fell .
the gods are having their revenge .
they' re sending evil spirits down .
the gods have left us .
karma , what shall we do ?
this is your fault .
here is his poison .
this is our evil spirit .
whoever' s scared tell me , but don' t blame me for it .
guide the yaks over here .
grandfather , my feet hurt .
do we have to go this far tomorrow ??
yes , and the days after that too .
eventually you will develop corns under your feet .
you will be a real dolpopa .
the beginning is tough .
it stays that way .
stop whining .
karma' s got a four day lead .
we must overtake them before the pass .
buddhas of the three era , padmasambhava .
rid us of all obstacles , internal , external or hidden .
make our wishes come true .
i' m not walking any further .
and i' m hungry .
just a little bit .
i' m hungry .
stop .
everyone .
pasang is hungry .
tinle , look , they' re tired .
they' ve stopped .
what' s the matter ?
i want to go home .
what do we eat when we don' t sell out salt ?
your grandfather has never given up .
paljor , explain to him ... that a true dolpopa never gives up .
i' m too tired for that anyway .
it' s because of us you' re getting more and more behind by the day .
me and pasang will go back .
no you won' t .
what are you going to do in the village ?
pasang belongs here .
he' s still a child .
yesterday he was one .
let' s sit down .
tinle said we would stop by that mountain . which mountain ?
can you see the shadow on the left side ?
there by that mountain ridge .
next to that ravine ?
no , next to that brown mountain .
the one in the sunlight ?
what sun ?
what mountain ?
they' re all the same .
you' re tired .
lean on me .
i' m younger than you are .
my yak is getting old .
we' ve been walking for eight days now .
eight days ?
it' s already been ten days since we left .
what' s he hoping for ?
we' il never gain on kharma .
he' s crazy .
we' il die in here if we' re not careful .
we have to end this .
you tell him .
me ?
you' re his best friend ?
what is that ?
a tree .
will we be seeing trees on our way ?
an entire forest .
have you ever seen a tree ?
no .
so how can you draw them ?
my teacher taught me .
how large is a tree ?
when you' re on top you can see far , like on a mountain .
like a leader .
what do you mean ?
like grandfather .
he can see far .
i' m exhausted .
wanneer zijn we er ?
i' m so tired .
grandfather .
i' m so tired .
we walk and walk and walk but we' il never get there in time .
we' il never catch up with karma .
be a sensible man .
the boy is exhausted .
if we die it' il be your fault .
we' ve always helped each other .
we must succeed .
succeed ?
at what ?
we have no other choice .
grandfather .
behind that mountain once leopards got two of my yaks .
ngeunpo' s yaks .
the screaming scares away the leopards .
not just the leopards .
the caravan .
it' s karma and the others .
that' s not the caravan .
it' s the pilgrims .
what are they ?
religious people that walk through mountains .
where are you from ?
mount kailash .
how far is shey riwo dupta ?
less than ten days from here .
where are you going ?
to the wheatlands .
have you seen the caravan ?
yes , and its two hundred yaks .
when ?
when ?
about three , four ..
no five days ago .
can' t be more than three days ago .
they were young and walking at a fast pace .
i thought we could make it .
we can' t gain on them .
karma knows the mountains well .
we' il never make it .
tinle is too stubborn .
but the mountains have been kind .
in one week we could be home safely again .
the mountains are our home .
we live for the yaks and the salt .
it' s insane to try and gain on karma .
you would be able to finish your fresco .
that can wait .
show me your hands .
why did you come with us ?
when you left the monastery ...
i remembered the words of one of my teachers .
' if you have to choose which way to go , take the most difficult way . '
the most difficult way ...
the hardest way .
the hardest way ?
some more tea ?
haven' t you had enough yet ?
labrang , don' t tell me you didn' t bring any beer .
you' ve forbidden me to bring beer .
and you listened to that ?
too bad , we have to drink karma' s then .
we will take the lake route tomorrow .
for god' s sake , tinle .
the devil' s path ?
i walked the path long ago once and i' m still here .
do evil spirits live there ?
if we make it ...
we will be ahead of them by the time we . reach the pass you go .
i' m leaving
you just go .
and keep your frontdoor locked tightly .
tinle , you' re asking too much of us .
what do you want to eat this winter ?
salt ?
i' m going to get our wheat .
we have no other choice .
we will be facing evil spirits .
in the flesh .
enough praying .
we' re leaving .
hold the yaks .
what' s wrong ?
part of the path fell down .
stop .
we can' t pass here .
what are you doing ?
the yaks can' t turn around and go back .
we must go through .
give me that stone .
not that one .
a smaller one .
where are you going ?
you' re going to fall !
i want to help grandfather .
be careful .
of course i will .
you can' t pass .
stay there .
stop them .
will this be strong enough ?
are you asking me ?
try it .
come , ngeunpo .
if you can make it all yaks will .
the path is safe now .
tundrup built it .
just like your fence .
get the yaks coming one by one .
oh god .
careful .
there is just enough room .
step by step .
give me your hand .
we' ve made it .
one yak and two bags of salt .
it is the price the spirits asked .
look , more pilgrims .
they have yaks with them .
are you serious ?
it' s a caravan .
it' s pilgrims .
no , it' s a caravan .
there is a lama there .
it look like that' s ngeunpo .
it' s tinle yaks .
it' s tinle .
and pasang , chopga en norbou .
they' re all there .
tinle is here .
karma , tinle is here .
we' il make camp there .
welcome tinle .
join us for a drink .
we' il stay here for two days .
let us take care of your yaks .
they' re already unloading them .
i didn' t know you were this close behind us .
i would' ve waited .
i haven' t been following you .
i left at the date we set .
bu that' s four days after we left .
four days ?
no one can be that fast .
it' s impossible they left so late .
he' s done the impossible .
ling' s prophesy .
when there' s good weather ahead the salt crackles .
when the weather' s going to be bad it' s as silent as the grave .
i don' t hear anything .
the salt is silent .
bad weather is coming .
we' re leaving tomorrow .
it didn' t crackle .
the salt didn' t crackle .
tinle ... we have been walking for two weeks straight .
our men and our yaks are exhausted .
we were going to rest for two days .
the grass is good here and the sky is blue .
the sky is playing games with us .
the salt didn' t crackle .
we must cross the pass now .
we can' t put our lives at stake for a handful of salt .
this salt has helped us for centuries .
are you listening to him ?
salt can' t talk .
it' s nonsense .
you must take the gods seriously .
if we survive this we have ourselves to thank for it .
ourselves .
not the gods .
please understand .
you are a leader , but not his son .
sometimes i wonder if lhakpa ...
he didn' t want you to come .
i wanted to follow him .
i should have persisted .
don' t blame yourself for it .
do you see that star ?
if you look closely you' il see that it beats just like a heart .
it is this star you must learn to find .
there are so many stars .
yes , but this one star ... is ours .
this is the star that will lead us to the land of the wheat .
our grand grandfathers already followed this star .
where is pasang ?
have you seen pasang ?
no .
are you coming with him ?
come with us .
you won' t survive the snow storm .
you will die here .
where is that snow storm ?
have you seen the stars ?
tinle is wrong .
he know these mountains .
come with us .
do it for me .
you have to choose now .
either you come with tinle or you' re staying with me .
you' re just like him .
all you ever think of is yourself .
and what about you ?
when will you start thinking of yourself ?
karma .
pasang .
let him , father .
stay out of this .
so should you .
come with us .
i can' t .
come with us , everyone together .
help him up .
we' re taking the salt .
tinle' s going to get us all killed .
aren' t you cold ?
tinle , let' s stop .
we' il never make it across .
we can' t even see where the path is .
we must face that storm .
let' s wait for it to pass .
there is enough food for four days .
if we go back we' il all die .
i am tinle .
master of the mountains .
father ...
are you alright , father ?
don' t listen to them . keep going , even though you' re going only slowly .
do not make camp before you reach the four chorten .
why ?
keep on walking .
i' m going to see if anyone was left behind .
grandfather .
straight into the mountains , boy .
have you seen my father ?
no .
i thought he was with you ?
father ...
tinle ...
if we' re not careful we' il get lost too .
we have to keep searching .
he' s got lost in the dark .
there .
father ...
he saw the storm in the clear blue sky .
i didn' t see anything .
i walked straight into the trap .
if you' d come with us you wouldn' t have saved him .
did i save him or did the mountains spare him ?
you don' t understand .
he will take everything from you .
you' re the leader .
don' t think like that father .
i' m not a leader .
i' m a painter , a son who helped his father out .
and pasang ?
pasang has made his decision .
everything will be alright .
let them .
are you going shooting ?
learn how to saddle your yak .
wear this or you will be blinded .
and you' il cry .
the boy is in good hands .
it' s up to you now .
don' t forget ... a leader guides his people ... but receives his orders from the gods .
don' t you ever forget .
i dreamt that you were my father .
you' re too much like me for me to be your father ... for you to be my son .
do you think i' ve never wanted to defy the lamas ?
a true leader starts by being disobedient .
the gods triumph .
what are you doing ?
put me down .
i' m staying here .
we will look for herbs to cure you down in the valley .
you want to cure me ?
i' m not ill .
i' m old .
leave him here .
he belongs here , in these mountains .
chopga' s right .
it' s what he wants .
karma , you will have to be their leader .
just go .
take good care of pasang .
you' ve gotten behind too much already because of me .
we' re almost there .
i can' t leave you behind when i' ve just found you .
we' ve always been connected .
we' ve always wanted the same .
tinle , please don' t die .
let him go .
he' s going to join my father in padmasambhava' s paradise .
i' ve learned so much .
from you , my father tinle , my brother lhakpa ...
from you , my nephew pasang of you , pema ... and from you , karma .
this fresco is for you .
it' s finished .
it tells a story .
the story of pasang ...
the youth of a leader .
the gods triumph .
