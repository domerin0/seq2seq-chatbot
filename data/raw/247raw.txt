here was troy 3000 years ago , a city of destiny ... ... so situated that it dominated the hellespont ... ... today known as the dardanelles .
this was the only sea route to and from the east .
as a result , troy grew prosperous ... ... a tempting prize of war for the greek nations .
the trojans had long memories of the time when the greeks , led by sparta ... ... had pillaged and burned the city of their fathers .
they had prepared strong defenses against the possibility of future assault .
that is why new troy , their rebuilt city ... ... was guarded by mighty walls , an impregnable shelter ... ... for a happy people in love with beauty .
in the palace square and the busy streets ... ... the industrious citizens were enjoying the works of peace ... ... as though this carefree era would last forever .
there was lord aeneas , nephew of king priam ... ... on his way to the palace ... ... where the future of troy was being weighed by the royal council .
and so we' ve locked out the understanding of nations ... ... and we' ve locked in the poison .
trojans jumping at every rumor ... ... pointing fingers at each other .
i tell you there' s only one solution .
have your way .
go to sparta .
go wherever you will ... ... but don' t try to drag the destiny of troy with you .
what destiny , to live like a crab in a shell ?
we live well .
we tax traders at the sea gate .
that' s our blood .
stupidity !
we' il choke on our own fat unless we sail our ships of trade .
but how can we , when every harbor is an enemy' s ?
oh , i' m sick of your crazy dreams .
careful , brother .
paris has always been able to crack your neck .
and you can thrash us both .
tell him he' s a fool , hector !
my sons ... ... the fool is the man who makes a quarrel of a debate .
paris , i bless your plan to sail to sparta .
i know i can trust you not to beg for peace .
i' il try to convince the greeks our power makes a treaty advisable .
i' d convince them .
i' d take 100 ships of war and burn the soil of sparta black !
i' m sure you would , polydorus , and create endless war .
and you , hector , do you aspire to anything ...
... but to excel at swordplay and boxing ?
yes , sire .
the javelin and the discus .
hector' s a good son , priam .
and a good husband , my lord .
is that not sufficient glory ?
by your leave , paris ' ship is ready to sail .
do the gods approve the day and the hour ?
the omens are good and also the prophecies , with but one exception .
one troubled priestess of the temple .
my daughter .
don' t be angry , priam .
cassandra is ill .
sick in the mind .
arise , paris ... ... and go .
the virgin cassandra does make one point that causes me much concern .
prince paris , it appears , gives all his worship to one goddess alone .
aphrodite .
i' m not sure i worship anything .
no .
admiration is the better word .
admiration for the beauty of a marble image .
it was not the goddess of beauty who taught us to arm against our enemies ... ... but athena , the goddess of wisdom ... ... and the patroness of the horses of war .
athena does not rejoice in this ....
this solitary adoration of yours .
neither is she delighted that you undertake a mission of peace .
and i suppose that evil horse of hers will spring out and trample me .
very well .
let it come , my lord ... ... if that' s the price of living in a world of fables .
do not say that , paris .
do not seek peace elsewhere , dear brother ... ... until first you have pacified athena .
my little cassandra , there can be no postponement .
give me your blessing for a happy voyage .
i cannot bless what i see in your future .
cassandra !
cassandra , stop this .
but , father , it' s true .
what i see and feel is true .
go , paris .
come , cassandra .
come and rest a while .
how can i , mother ?
oh , i wish it hadn' t been given me ... ... this agony i live with .
paris !
paris , don' t go .
please don' t go .
i must sail at once .
if you have any love for troy ... ... don' t bring this dreadful thing upon us .
and i thought you loved me best of all .
i do , but ... ... the noise , the storm grows so great .
the screaming of horses , the cries of dying men .
take care of her .
my dear , my dear .
perhaps it could not be otherwise .
what must be , no one can change .
where are we today ?
elysium ?
far from it .
we' re nearing sparta ... ... a harsh military land , where a man will cut off his arm to prove he' s brave .
i wonder what the women look like .
my profound cousin aeneas .
to think deeply , paris , one must think of women .
they bring all life into the world and much death .
they sway the destinies of men .
not my destiny .
what' s the matter ?
oh , just a quickening of the breeze .
but i don' t like the hot breath of it .
oh , it' s nothing .
only one drifting cloud up there .
up the mast with you !
i command you !
climb the mast !
drop the sail !
my prince , the ropes are fouled , and these men refuse to climb the mast .
i' il flay them !
no !
there' s only one way to cure these fantasies .
no , my prince , not you .
no !
paris !
paris !
paris !
paris !
paris !
paris !
megas !
aphrodite .
what ?
some ship had bad luck .
she does exist .
who ?
the fairest goddess .
this creature is crazy .
but with a nice sort of craziness .
what was your ship ?
the dolphin ...
... of troy .
a trojan .
cut him loose , andros .
maybe we can warm some life into him before we turn him over to the soldiers .
women !
why warm a man to cut his throat ?
cover him up , quickly .
we' re looking for our sovereign lady , the queen of sparta .
she came to the shore to visit a nurse of her childhood days .
my lady .
i left orders not to be disturbed here .
but there are certain developments which make this beach unsafe today .
a strange ship was sighted running out of the storm .
we couldn' t go after her .
heavy seas .
she might have been trojan .
it' s possible she left spies .
you see trojan phantoms everywhere .
this was no phantom ship .
the emblem of the royal house of troy .
the king would want me to insist that his queen return at once .
lnform king menelaus that cora is taking excellent care of me .
go along now .
very well , my lady .
andraste !
andraste , help us carry this man .
a man , my lady ?
how interesting !
i can' t risk hiding a trojan .
yes .
what if he' s a warrior and only pretending ?
you must be careful .
women who are always careful miss much in life , andraste .
he doesn' t seem to recover .
but his heart beats .
give him some broth , and we' il turn him over .
good .
oh , no !
they' il kill him .
i still say good .
and i , too , would say so ...
... if he were as unattractive as you .
thank you .
to whom am i indebted for this gallant defense ?
nobody of importance .
i am only a slave .
now tell us about yourself , trojan .
did i mention that ?
my memory is clouded .
but i do recall i thought you a vision .
a goddess .
dear aphrodite ... ... allow me to present myself .
prince paris of troy .
we' il dispense with impudence .
you' re a bit impudent yourself for whatever you are , a slave ?
silence !
you' re addressing  a slave of the palace , andros .
of what importance is that ?
i tell you truly , i am prince paris .
i come to offer a treaty of peace to king menelaus .
but of course , you don' t believe me .
my articles of identity ... ... all the gifts i was bringing to the court of sparta ....
my crew won' t come near a spartan harbor now .
they' il swear the gods hurled lightning at me .
perhaps i do believe you .
the sea has damaged your appearance , but not your manner .
you must leave here at nightfall .
follow the coast .
you' il reach a cove where phoenician ships put in .
no .
i still have a mission .
do as i tell you !
our soldiers have a habit of plunging a dagger into strangers .
and why should that worry you ?
never mind .
the feelings of a slave are of no importance .
they are to me .
in any place but sparta , one so fair would be a queen .
in troy , we' d make songs about you .
king menelaus would not permit that here .
because you' d make his queen look plain .
she would be pained to hear you say that .
do you know her ?
she owns me .
i' m her shadow .
and i always thought i knew her .
no , i don' t believe anyone knows queen helen very well ...
... including helen .
not even the king ?
great power doesn' t need knowledge .
wait .
i only ask these questions ...
... because i must go to the palace .
don' t chance it .
i intend to be discreet , so prepare me .
if menelaus won' t help me , i' il ask the queen .
that you must never do !
i
oh , if you were old and ugly , maybe then she could help you .
but you' re not old , nor ugly .
it' s late , andros .
we must get the fish to market .
gladly .
if the soldiers find him here , i don' t want to be involved .
i wouldn' t mind .
we must get back to the palace , andraste .
i' ve stayed here too long .
promise me ... ... we' il meet again .
you can go back now .
supplies , for your voyage home .
so you still hope i won' t go to the palace ?
more than ever .
the kings of greece are gathering there to consider a war against troy .
then my mission was well timed .
when will they be in council ?
tomorrow , perhaps .
but tonight ... ... there are only you and l .
under the magic of the moonlight .
here .
see what i brought you ?
my dear little slave girl ... ... i don' t want what you steal from the palace .
i only want what i steal from the palace .
no , my prince .
very well , then , i' il borrow you .
but we' il be quite honest about it .
i' il offer to buy you from the queen .
oh , no !
that would mean death !
nonsense .
i' il explain to her that you' re no slave to me ... ... but my future princess of troy .
let me go , paris .
don' t you believe i could love a slave ?
yes , i believe .
my heart believes and loves you .
my heart is yours , paris , but i can never be .
you must not seek out the queen , nor anyone at the palace .
and this moment must be our last .
don' t ask me why .
call it magic , call it a dream .
and never speak of it to anyone .
hear our spartan host , king menelaus .
are you sure ulysses is coming ?
his ship was not far behind mine .
this great ithacan refused to leave his wife and farm .
he' s so sick of war , he wouldn' t let go of the plow .
till his child was cast in front of it , to convince him greece' s glory ... ... comes before contentment .
you can have the glory .
i' il take troy' s gold .
not my share , brother .
ulysses , king of lthaca !
greetings , friend .
you' re acquainted with everyone .
ajax , prince of salamis .
nestor , king of pylos .
diomedes , ruler of aetolia .
and i think you know my brother , king agamemnon of mycenae .
greetings , fellow pirates .
it is a righteous war we plan , ulysses ... ... a war of defensive aggression .
a neat sort of righteousness .
you think the trojans built a citadel for peace lovers ?
have you heard of priam' s sons ?
polydorus begs for war !
hector wants only a challenge .
paris is anyone' s equal with a cestus , bow and javelin .
you believe they want peace ?
all the more reason why we cannot plan without achilles .
but he hates my brother and me
he hates you almost as much as he loves war .
in order to lock himself from all temptation of joining with us ... ... he hid himself securely , in a house of women .
that' s where i found him , hiding from all persuasion ... ... dressed as a woman !
did you persuade him ?
yes .
he' s here at the stables , seeing to the care of his horses .
achilles , a blushing girl .
i shall commend him for the beauty of his face and figure .
the man who blows his own horn .
commend him , menelaus .
i commend you , achilles .
and i despise you .
and you , agamemnon .
but it seems we must unite ... ... so i am here to lead you .
lead us , achilles ?
of course .
i and my good friend patroclus .
since we were boys , we could stand alone and defy an army .
i question that .
who ?
i , ajax .
my imitator .
you disgusting glory hunter .
to imitate him , i' d need to wear three layers of armor .
that' s where he gets his reputation for being invulnerable .
silence this fool , menelaus .
i would prefer not to be angered by him .
the truth of the matter is , his skin' s as tender as his vanity .
and especially his heel .
he can' t even stand leather against it .
i do not fight with my feet .
take your ease , my prince .
i' il handle this buffoon .
enough of this .
we must remain united .
lmpossible .
we' ve never been united , and we never will be .
keep my horses ready .
patroclus , we shall leave .
i see no ethical purpose for a raid on troy .
nor i.
now , wait .
wait .
here .
you talk of ethics .
here' s the sign of a trojan ship prowling our shores .
no peaceful trader , but a royal ship of the house of priam .
it was my ship , sire .
i am paris of troy .
you are king menelaus ?
yes .
sorry to present myself like this , i was swept overboard in the storm .
fortunately , this gathering of the most royal of greece ... ... makes my mission easier .
how' d you know we were here ?
i beg my lord' s indulgence , i know .
so i' m saved from journeying to each king ... ... if you decide against offers of peace i bring from troy .
what ?
troy does not plan war ?
you are wrong , menelaus .
stop this or lose your trojan plunder .
where' d you find this impostor ?
he came to the palace .
i thought you' d question him .
you interrupt council !
hear him .
this is our business .
he' s only some wandering vagabond .
see the rags he wears .
these roving jesters come often to my palace .
and they never fail to have some nimble talent .
what do you do besides this royal imposture ?
it seems i try to do the impossible .
the cesti .
if he' s paris , he should have some skill with the cesti .
brilliant , brother , brilliant .
you heard , ajax , achilles ?
achilles is weary from travel .
achilles did not make his reputation fighting children .
this sparta , my son , is a viper' s nest .
i' il see you aren' t  if we offend the pretender ...
... i give him leave to go .
no .
after all , part of my task was to spread civilization .
but i must exact an agreement .
if i come fairly out of this fight , will you believe that i am paris ... ... and hear the trojan peace terms ?
if your head' s still on your shoulders , yes .
paris !
my good trojan , you have used a spartan persuasion on me : courage .
my courage almost failed me at the thought of meeting ajax .
you shall rest .
and tomorrow we shall talk .
about your adventures , your voyage ... ... and the secret charm that makes me call you " friend .
and troy shall call sparta " friend .
alpheus , find quarters for our guest .
and , alpheus ... ... they say the trojans have great eyes for beauty .
find him a slave and see that she is beautiful .
there is one slave in your palace for whom i' d gladly become a slave myself .
menelaus !
you expressed a wish yesterday to present your guests to me .
a proud wish .
helen , queen of sparta , wife to menelaus ... ... i present paris , prince royal of troy .
why are you here , trojan ?
to study our arts and culture ?
yes , my lady .
the art of self preservation .
trojan impudence !
by your leave , my lord ... ... i shall receive the greeks at some happier moment .
i heard my lady was truly spartan this afternoon .
my heart behaved like a fool .
i' m sure menelaus could hear it beating .
tell your servants to go .
you may go .
get out !
when will you learn ?
the man can neither speak nor hear .
what did you think of the trojan ?
you saw what i thought .
yes , i saw what you thought .
of this trojan anyway .
what is this game you' re playing ?
helen , you reveal yourself .
so does he .
speak plainly .
if i' ve given you some offense , punish me ... ... but don' t welcome a stranger with one hand and strike him with the other !
so now we' re fond of trojans ?
i might do many things with him .
i might send him home ... ... with his appearance altered .
i might hold him hostage to bleed tribute out of priam .
i imagined once i had married a king .
you married a king .
i married a robber .
why did you marry him ?
why did you marry him ?
when a king takes spoils , he robs no one .
when he kills , he commits no murder .
he fulfills justice .
the way of a spartan .
i understand these things .
you do not .
i understand enough .
then understand your place in the palace , nowhere else !
you' ve seen this man before .
admit it .
your silence condemns you .
you' ve been out of the palace secretly .
admit it .
you know this man .
silent as ever .
no words for me , your husband .
i am your husband !
don' t .
say " husband " to me .
say " husband " to me .
i can think of many ways of dealing with your trojan , helen .
andraste .
i am the slave sent to the prince of troy .
the queen' s handmaiden , eh ?
the king commands me to entertain his guests .
a fine greek custom , but guest ?
he' s in a prison , if he only knew it .
oh , i' m instructed that he shall not know it .
must king menelaus command you himself to admit me ?
the royal temper' s already running a fever .
shall i tell the king you said that ?
get to your business , you little troublemaker .
you should be in bed .
yes , i should but
but your mistress sent you to play another trick on me .
no .
she sent me to help you escape .
escape ?
those two soldiers on watch down there ... ... are they going to help me too ?
you' re a captive .
the king plans tortures for you .
you must leave quickly .
return to the fisherman' s hut .
i' il go a distance with you to point the way .
my good friend menelaus .
the door is also watched .
then what chance have i ?
helen thought to make you look like a merchant .
any fool could see you' re a prince .
soldiers .
fisherman !
yes ?
fisherman !
yes ?
what do you want ?
a cup of wine .
our throats are salted by the breeze .
oh .
cora , the wineskin .
the captain' s an idiot .
does he think the man will swim ?
he' d be deep in the forest by now .
here .
take it with you .
go , and remember , there will be soldiers above ... ... so you' d best try the rocks under the cliff .
get to a cove beyond the tower .
there , a boat will send you to the ship .
wings of mercury speed you .
why do you wait ?
it was just a foolish hope .
i half imagined she' d come .
here ?
she sent you garments ... ... arranged for a phoenician ship to take you home .
what more , trojan ?
i didn' t really expect her to come .
i only hoped .
don' t even breathe it .
if she should show her face here and be recognized ....
i know .
and i wish i could repay you for your kindness .
and for the queen ... ... tell her she' il walk in all my dreams .
wait !
the ship is not yet in the cove .
helen .
andraste , you are free .
go as far away as you can from sparta .
my lady .
you made clear to adelphus what i said ?
he is far off by this time .
then be on your way .
freedom is made of quicksilver sometimes .
go .
hurry .
helen .
helen is the queen .
the girl you thought you knew was quite nameless and without reality .
i can' t believe that .
it was she who helped me to escape .
no .
that was the queen who hates cruelty .
she would have done the same for any slave .
i see .
she is the queen who comes here to say this .
she will always remember the gentle paris .
and she will do her small part to turn this nation from war .
you' re not a spartan .
i am .
daughter of a king who chose a spartan husband for me .
a man you despised .
i despise oppression , as do many others here .
we need to be spartan to endure it .
and we need to be understood .
you are .
you , not menelaus , will be sparta to me .
i' il tell my father there' s still hope .
i' il tell troy what i' ve seen and heard .
the rulers divided , unable to find cause for war ... ... even the spartan people .
stop worrying .
the kings have been carousing all night .
and so she is real , that one i loved .
yes .
the gods sometimes change the bravest of intentions .
they are kind .
i' il never doubt them again .
oh , helen .
helen , you are a slave as long as menelaus possesses you .
come away to freedom .
come to troy with me .
and destroy the hope of peace you were taking home with you ?
no .
if even one trojan dies on the walls , i' m a failure .
forgive me , helen .
you are two women , both wise and good .
i am two men .
one fairly good , i try to believe .
the other , very bad indeed .
one is a man .
the other just a boy , i think .
paris , let him be so always .
never let him grow old .
helen .
the ship .
and now i must go back .
it is a way the gods have ... ... to give with one hand and take with two .
oh , no .
this is not goodbye .
you shall still be with me across the sea .
and you with me .
and always young , paris , remember ?
what is remembered is forever young .
halt !
stand still , trojan .
my lady , i ask you remove yourself  send your archers away .
i beg the queen to stand out of danger .
you wouldn' t dare .
you' il die .
i can no more than lose my own life , and it' s lost if i let him go .
silence !
helen !
helen !
helen !
you lie .
she' s in there .
no .
she' s in there .
break the locks !
break them .
break .
it' s true .
the trojan' s taken helen .
he' s carried her away .
by force , against her will .
to think of her struggles , her fruitless cries for help .
we had our differences , but she was my wife .
it goes deeper than that .
this is the assault of all women in greece .
shame .
shame on every greek nation .
then man your ships .
follow them .
ulysses , why do you sit ?
she must be restored to me .
not now , menelaus .
later .
yes .
now , now , now !
will you not stand with me ?
menelaus , we will reclaim her , and with her , all the loot of troy .
but only if you wait .
we' il send out a call to every city in greece .
all greeks united in a war of honor .
yes .
that' s what the future will call it .
i call it that now .
this prince of troy has asked for war , not peace .
ulysses .
i' m sure you' il agree with me that it is my duty to become our leader .
leader ?
i' il see no one but achilles as leader .
it is my consecrated duty to become our leader to avenge my dear brother .
quite , quite , agamemnon .
and i will follow you .
and tell you what to do , as usual .
and i will persuade the sensitive achilles ... ... with certain fascinating facts ... ... about the great store of gold to be found in troy .
i seek no treasure .
i will kill .
so shall we all , brother .
to defend your honor .
who are they ?
i don' t know , but i know the color of their gold .
sparta is the past , helen .
troy is this way .
what will they call us there ?
a woman who left her husband .
a prince turned thief .
what else can we ever be ?
two people in love .
against the world , if need be .
if i could make a bargain with the gods ... ... we would escape the world ... ... never landing on any shore .
a lovely dream , but somewhere we must land .
paris , there' s an island called pelagos .
the sea can feed us .
and there are little houses near the village well .
let' s go there .
i cannot .
i was born to an obligation .
paris , son of priam , heir to responsibility .
i could leave the kingdoms of the world and never miss them .
but you  helen ... ... our life together will fade if i run from this .
it will become a slight thing that any storm can tear apart .
no , paris .
forgive me .
i forget you are a woman , not a goddess .
captain .
you know the island of pelagos ?
it' s far southward ...
... through the cytherean straits .
sail southward .
captain .
yes ?
we have decided otherwise .
sail north to troy .
what is it ?
you' il have to see , lord aeneas .
wait .
aeneas , call the queen .
paris !
paris .
come and meet my brothers .
hector , polydorus .
i told you about them .
lucky paris .
you could fall in the black pit of hades ... ... and come out with arms full of sunshine .
he' s always had a fine flair for surprises .
i' m happy to see that you diverted your mission ... ... to an enterprise more to your talents .
come .
aeneas .
paris .
paris .
i should have had faith .
the great god zeus would never let him die ...
... and with him our hopes of peace .
it' s a miracle .
tell us what happened , paris .
here is your miracle .
i would never have seen troy again but for her .
it would have taken a sea sprite to save you .
how could one so tender have managed it ?
postpone your questions .
she suffered an ordeal that i shan' t relate in her presence .
it' s enough that our son has been given back to us by you , my dear .
you are welcome , my child .
paris , call the high steward .
see that she is made comfortable .
later , you shall tell me of your adventures .
at your command , father .
my brother seems to have forgotten his courtliness .
by what name , my lady , shall we know you ?
my name is  her name is death .
cassandra !
forgive her .
she suffers an illness .
wait .
you were going to say ?
i am helen , queen of sparta .
the wife of king menelaus ?
his wife no more .
the goddess of beauty , aphrodite ... ... come down to earth in mortal form .
she will bring the disaster i have prophesied .
her name will be written in letters of fire .
helen .
helen of troy .
and she saved my life again ... ... but at such risk to herself that i couldn' t leave her ... ... to the mercy of the spartans .
i can see i' ve troubled you , sire .
but in your affection for me and mine for you ... ... i hope you will judge me fairly .
i would never have believed that this could happen ... ... not through this son of mine .
this son who shared my hope of everlasting peace .
who promised he would bring it .
and what have you brought ?
dishonor .
you have united the greeks .
you have kindled a flame that will weld them together against us .
this will bring them to our very shores .
that should delight you .
you may have to answer for the death of many a good trojan .
you have presumed too much upon our affection .
paris ... ... send her back to sparta and make your peace with menelaus .
i' il never send her back .
you reject every word of wisdom ?
my love has no logic .
it could only choose between troy and pelagos .
helen wanted to go to pelagos ... ... but i had to bring you the warning .
and she had the courage to come with me .
but she was right .
there is no heart in troy .
we' il seek it elsewhere .
the coward' s way to avoid the fight ?
you exceed the rights of a brother .
and you ....
you scorn every trojan duty .
the damage is done .
go or stay .
it matters not .
i shall not see you again .
priam .
bring to the council chamber the armory masters and the granary stewards .
tell them i want an estimate of troy' s ability to withstand a siege .
there were times when i almost forgot that i had other children , paris ... ... others to die , perhaps .
destiny , paris .
destiny .
every trojan woman with son or husband will curse you .
well , don' t worry , brother , a war may clear the atmosphere .
war , the only thing that could make you happy .
keep out of my way , or you' il never live to enjoy it .
lord aeneas .
you may go .
the ship that brought you to troy is still in the harbor .
my charioteer will take you there .
i see .
or if my lady prefers , i' il arrange for a royal escort .
no , i won' t delay .
wait for us .
my chariot will be in the courtyard .
athena wields much power , it seems .
if i return to menelaus  no .
pelagos ?
yes , i' il take you to pelagos .
you said our lives would fade if you ran away .
i also said that you' d be happy in troy .
paris , the word has spread .
they are not armed with flowers .
quick , before they overrun the courtyard .
they won' t as long as they enjoy their carnival .
take helen to the harbor .
don' t show yourself to them .
see her aboard the ship .
paris !
dog !
you expect us to fight a war for your amusement ?
my brave trojans ... ... will you show as much spirit against the spartan army ... ... as against one spartan woman ?
can you stand alone , each , in battle ... ... or do you need the cowardice of numbers to make you bold ?
go home and search your hearts , trojans ... ... for all this must be answered soon .
you can leave safely now .
without you ?
i' ve gained a victory of a sort tonight .
i mustn' t lose it , helen .
there' s no pelagos if i' m there alone .
but there' s always one island where the storm can' t touch us .
it' s anyplace , paris , where we' re together .
here ?
oh , yes , even here .
news reached troy that the greeks were about to sail ... ... with the mightiest armada ever known to man .
the trojans prepared for war .
our signals have never warned of so many ships .
that' s all right .
we' re ready .
hundreds .
many more than we can count .
five , 600 .
more .
no less than 1000 ships .
we' il make them pay a heavy price .
what shall we pay ?
aeneas , bring them here .
let them see .
yes , sire .
faster .
faster .
see what you have brought upon us ?
father .
the face that launched 1000 ships .
now remember , these trojan walls are our strength and our substance ... ... so let no eager fool attempt to charge this plain ... ... until these ramparts have served their purpose .
well , to your posts .
hector , where is my place ?
beside your spartan woman .
come with me , brother .
i' il share spartan blood with you .
you can have my share .
no trojans to greet us ?
i had hoped they' d be foolish enough to scatter their forces .
where do we make camp , agamemnon ?
camp ?
no , onwards .
every moment of delay , my helen suffers .
our camp is the trojan palace .
we must attack at once .
against troy' s walls , achilles ?
no .
we must equip to take this fortress .
ulysses is right .
we must prepare .
the canny counsel of ulysses prevailed .
the greeks consolidated their beachhead and built machines for attack ... ... on a scale big enough to match the trojan walls .
follow achilles !
hector .
to the ramps .
back !
we' re outflanked !
fall back !
return to your towers .
to the ramps .
back !
back !
polydorus .
it' s a good war , paris .
hector , the man of peace ... ... now our greatest warrior .
thank helen for your destiny .
thank paris .
i thank him for my life .
oh , great zeus , king of all ... ... we give to you polydorus , prince of troy .
i pray you , judge him with compassion and understanding .
let not athena' s hatred feed on my defenseless son ... ... but on our sorrow here .
we , the living dead of troy , shall pay his debt ... ... in the years of siege to come .
and the greeks did prepare for years of siege .
they unloaded provisions from their ships ... ... and as time went on they looted and raped ... ... the small surrounding villages .
take your hands off her !
a warrior commanding his commander ?
she' s mine .
great as you are , i' m still your chieftain , protector of all the spoils of war .
take her to my quarters .
no .
agamemnon , if you take this girl , i shall sail home .
then fly , mighty warrior .
fly .
agamemnon !
he didn' t mean that , achilles .
come on .
sail home , great warrior .
no , achilles .
out !
out !
out !
achilles , agamemnon does not speak for all our people .
dogs !
jackals !
i' il never fight his battles again .
but for greece , you' il fight .
no more .
during these years of stalemate , the trojans ... ... from the safety of their walls , constantly harassed the invaders ... ... with night raids on their camps .
helen , how perfect .
the girl you fell in love with ?
always keep that image with you , paris .
i shan' t need to .
i have the source of its magic .
right here , i hold its living warmth ... ... and its spirit is always with me on the ramparts .
then it can' t be lost , can it ?
what has been lived and shared is never lost .
never , helen .
but if you should lose me ... ... could you resign yourself to that ?
don' t worry , nothing will happen to you .
nothing endures on earth , paris , neither sorrow nor happiness ... ... or people in love .
dear helen , she looks for shadows in the one bright place in troy .
people in love should not be blind .
they should look to the future and prepare for separation .
but not so gloomily , my love .
i' il meet you in elysium ... ... where an age of years is just a wink of time .
you charter a ship .
i' il take the flying horse , pegasus .
to our island , paris ?
oh , goddess come to earth , make me immortal with your kiss ... ... and we' il live on nectar and ambrosia .
but i' m not sure i like being so ethereal .
nor i.
how many years , fellow trojans , shall we suffer ?
our only respite , a truce to burn our dead .
the holiday of a troy that once knew happy times .
must the trojans always set their funeral pyre so near this house ?
how long will they accuse me ?
they lost many loved ones , my lady .
lulled by the promises of peace forever .
i , for one , believe we might have had that peace ....
i thought i could escape from it , but there is no place
and no victory for anybody .
go .
leave me .
paris commanded me to stay with you while he' s on duty .
leave me , i tell you .
no , friends !
hear me , trojans .
cast her to the spartans .
cast paris out of troy .
if you haven' t the fiber for this ....
helen , don' t go out .
their mood is dangerous .
i' ve sent soldiers to disperse them .
you' ve come to ask me to leave troy .
no , helen .
no .
but for paris , i would have lost hector .
i must love my sons equally ... ... and whomsoever they love .
you are good .
the high priest says that even the gods fight each other .
some for athena and greece , some for troy and aphrodite .
how , then , could i blame you for this war ?
i could stop it .
no one could .
i could ... ... if i return to the greeks , to menelaus .
go back to someone you so despise ?
if it brings an end to war and restores paris to the love of the trojans ....
he' d never let you go .
and could i ever leave him ?
you must help me to decide .
would you defy the fates ?
no mortal should attempt so much , helen .
and yet i wonder ... ... is one so lovely quite mortal ?
lovely ?
no .
i am everything i was determined not to be .
i have only been selfish .
all the despair , the pain and the tears i' ve brought .
how different from that island dream .
return to your king of troy ... ... and tell him we will receive helen at the appointed place .
but warn him there must be no treachery or deceit .
i assure you , my lord , no deceit exists .
it is her wish to return to king menelaus .
it' s her wish .
you hear that , brother ?
i' ve heard it often .
wait , herald .
tell your master from menelaus that we demand
no , no , no .
nothing else .
nothing else , only the return of helen .
the trojans wish to make peace .
as men of peace , we accept their offer .
have we suffered to return empty handed ?
empty handed , menelaus ?
with helen returned , integrity satisfied ?
you are too outspoken , brother .
when the trojans have handed over helen , we' il teach them ... ... that we' re not easily bought off .
but i' d like achilles with us , in case they prove troublesome .
he still refuses to fight so long as you' re in command ... ... and your lovesick jackass of a brother brays upon this beach .
then he' il get not one obol of trojan tribute .
helen ?
helen .
where is she ?
she' s not here , paris .
not here ?
where ?
she' s gone to the camp of the greeks .
to menelaus ?
she was determined to end the destruction ... ... and restore you to the hearts of the trojans .
and you conspired with her  she was not a captive here , paris ... ... but a woman of self determination , a queen with more courage ... ... than i would have had to sail against the tides of heaven .
he shan' t take her .
the hour has passed , paris .
you can' t prevent it .
wait , trojans .
you' ve returned the wife of menelaus , but that isn' t all your debt .
debt ?
we recognize no claim of debt .
no ?
then who pays for the greek blood shed on this plain ?
trojan blood has paid in full .
trojan blood is not valid currency in sparta ... ... nor does it pay for launching 1000 ships .
the terms of this truce were clear .
the return of helen , in exchange for which ... ... you agreed to sail from these shores .
you trusting fools .
half the treasury of troy before we depart ... ... and after that , 1000 talents every year .
take these nobles as security !
here' s payment , menelaus !
to the gates with her !
bring her back to troy !
follow them !
after them !
after them !
back !
turn back !
don' t go too close to the trojan walls .
not against hector .
patroclus !
patroclus !
bring me my armor .
yes , master .
thank you , trojan , for bringing us the body of patroclus .
thank you very much .
my son , greek treachery has proved that theirs is not a war of honor .
helen , through you , we have learned that they seek plunder , not justice .
i ask forgiveness of you both .
cassandra ... ... we have found there is great wisdom in you .
what more can you tell us ?
new storms shall ride the sky ... ... but the guilt will be athena' s , not helen' s .
thank you , cassandra .
such courage must not go unrewarded .
helen , you will be a princess of troy .
where is hector and andromache ?
they are to bestow the laurels .
where is hector ?
by the scaean gates , sire .
he anticipates a call to single combat for the death of patroclus .
i killed him .
any greek challenge would come to me .
but hector didn' t want you to be challenged by achilles .
he was devoted to patroclus .
hector sent him his friend' s corpse ... ... with personal compliments .
no one can match achilles , not even hector .
this must not happen .
he cried like an animal in grief , my lord , and then called for his armor .
ah , so he comes .
hector !
hector !
it is done , andromache .
achilles ?
by his hand , my father and my brothers fell .
while you live , i still have them in you .
i intend to live , andromache , for you ... ... and for our son .
this helmet always frightens him .
let' s pray that he may never need one ... ... that he finds peace .
arms to bear .
if achilles wins , we move .
we strike at once !
to the palace !
and if achilles dies , we retire to consider a certain plan of mine .
there' s an immortal shield around him .
mighty zeus , help me find a weakness .
achilles is dead !
so dies greek courage , but not greek cunning .
defeated by men , deserted by the gods .
i used to number the months by a battle , a pestilence , a famine .
now it' s all one long nightmare .
i fought wars since most of you were sucklings , but never one like this .
let' s take our ships and sail back home .
that we shall do .
i have a plan that first required a trojan victory .
that much , at least , is accomplished .
you speak treason .
as you will , but let' s be realistic .
the greatest army on earth has lost its war .
what are you dreaming , ulysses ?
i' m dreaming of my wife , the good , constant penelope .
and in my dreams , i see myself returning to her with all the treasures of troy .
but how ?
has this anything to do with the work ... ... that apagos and his men have been doing in the woodlands ?
they' re building a monument to the triumph of paris and helen .
a gift from the goddess athena .
a sacred horse , so big and so beautiful ... ... that troy cannot help taking it to her heart .
remember , blow the retreat loud enough for troy to hear .
let the ships sail but keep sufficient force in the woodlands .
the ships will return at dawn .
are you sure the trojans will take this monstrosity into the city ?
i promise .
their gratitude to athena for her victory will be tremendous .
and they' il give a loving welcome to her wondrous horse .
and to bacchus , the god of grapes .
make ready , men of greece !
first they sounded retreat , and now the call to man the oars .
their torches are moving back to the sea .
aboard the ships ?
we' il soon know .
lord aeneas has gone to the shore with scouts .
sire , they' ve sailed .
the last of their ships has gone to sea .
sound the cry !
light the victory torch .
carry it through the streets .
good , priam .
good .
our heroes would wish us to rejoice .
light the victory torch !
you' il see a troy you' ve never known before .
i see it in your faces .
open it !
open it !
let us look at the world again !
the night smiles on us .
look , priam .
i was trying to tell you of it , sire .
some strange monument that the greeks have left at our doorstep .
beware the greeks bearing gifts .
my sister speaks truly .
it is a thing of evil that should be burnt upon the plain .
i agree .
the enemy doesn' t give joyful presents .
my children , this is no gift from the greeks ... ... but a symbol of worship they had to abandon .
sire , the people beg permission to bring this amazing prize into the square .
they have fought long and bravely .
i cannot deny them .
father , please hear me .
it is not the end of ruin , but the beginning .
we must not be ungrateful ... ... to a goddess who has proved herself our goddess .
bring in her sacred horse .
it shall be a monument to trojan valor .
yes , sire .
it is a great and perfect thing .
how childish i was to have misgivings .
and i to be afraid of a wooden giant .
what was that for ?
athena .
so forgiving of a rival goddess .
are you jealous , aphrodite ?
i' m only helen ... ... who wonders if she' il ever be a trojan , really .
when the trojan people look upon that plain ... ... won' t they always think of helen of sparta ?
there is peace everywhere now .
we' re not bound to remain here .
wherever you wish to go , helen , i' il take you .
hail to prince paris and his helen !
hail to helen !
all hail to paris !
hail to helen !
destiny , paris .
destiny .
there is no escape , it seems .
not even from happiness .
no , and i am happy .
very happy .
men of sparta !
men of sparta , to the palace !
forward !
troy is lost , but you must not die .
while the greeks plunder , make for the north gate .
do you think i would leave you now ?
or i ?
obey your king .
aeneas , take care of andromache and my grandson .
paris , helen ... ... i command you , go .
magnificent leadership , agamemnon .
athena will reward you with all the glory .
all of you , break in !
helen !
take them !
the rest of you , search !
find her !
don' t let me get lost , paris .
never .
paris !
paris !
paris !
paris !
oh , paris !
paris !
paris !
i thought i was lost !
the gods are with us .
come .
paris !
for a moment , i thought ...
... that you were that little slave girl .
oh , i am .
whatever your love wishes me to be , whatever is in your heart .
you are my heart .
paris .
no .
my ship has returned for you .
go there .
wash his blood from you .
that can never be .
it' s my blood .
it can ' t be lost , paris , can it ?
what has been lived and shared is never lost .
never , helen .
then this is not goodbye .
you shall always be with me .
and you with me .
