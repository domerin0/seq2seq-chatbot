there' s simply no way to shield against every weaponized agent .
but i can make super immune systems ... by strengthening the human cellular response .
banner , i know where you' re going .
but manipulating the immune system is dangerous and stupid .
the president' s science advisors made it absolutely clear .
no human subjects .
david , i have wonderful news .
i' m gonna have a baby .
what' s it gonna be ?
look at that .
want the dinosaur ?
come on , let' s have a little fight .
come on .
you don' t scare me .
that' s a delicious eyeball .
you' re big and green and scary .
i' il run away .
bruce , you' re hurt .
jack hit him with the stick , but bruce wouldn' t hit him back .
he just stood there , shaking .
it' s okay .
strange he didn' t make a peep .
any other kid would' ve wailed his head off .
that' s bruce .
he' s like that .
he' s just so bottled up .
the samples we found in your lab , they were human blood .
you' ve ignored protocol .
you had no right snooping around in my lab .
that' s my business .
wrong , banner .
it' s government business and you' re off the project .
attention , all personnel !
fail safe has been initiated .
gamma decontamination will occur in 30 minutes .
evacuate immediately .
i repeat ... evacuate immediately !
edith .
david , what' s going on ?
i gotta talk to you , edith .
bruce , stay here .
what are you doing ?
david , please stop it !
no !
bruce , wake up , son .
bruce .
bruce .
another nightmare ?
i don' t know .
i don' t remember .
hi , mom .
already off to college .
i' m gonna miss you terribly .
i' il miss you , too .
please , come here .
look at you .
soon to be a great scientist .
i guess .
i mean , who knows ?
i do .
there' s something inside you so special .
some kind of greatness , i' m sure .
someday you' re gonna ... share it with the whole world .
berkeley nuclear biotechnology lnstitute
as far as i' m concerned , security ought to be ....
good morning , dr. krenzler .
security ought to be beefed up a lot more .
ln a place like this , you can' t be too careful .
bruce .
big day .
did you sleep ?
i didn' t sleep .
i slept okay . ls betty here ?
she' s around .
i really got to say , seeing you in that styling headwear ....
you implying something about my helmet ?
you look like a massive nerd , even around other scientists .
can i just ask ?
were you wearing the helmet while she dumped you ?
see , it protects my very important brain , harper .
go prep the samples .
hey , i found you .
betty , hey !
i hate them .
i just got here .
who do we hate ?
the review board .
we have to make a presentation on tuesday .
and you' re gonna make it with me .
you think i should ?
yeah , you' re great with that stuff .
you start talking about microbes and nanomeds ... you sound almost passionate .
sorry .
that was rude .
look , nobody expects this to be easy ... us working together after being so close .
we were close ?
bruce : lf i could be more ... whatever , you know .
i' m just ....
don' t .
it' s not your fault , really .
you' re just a byproduct of my inexplicable obsession ... with emotionally distant men .
i' il get over us .
good for you .
anyway , i' m just really stressed about this review .
lf we don' t get impressive results , we' il have a hard sell on tuesday .
then let' s go be impressive .
harper .
ready when you are .
let' s hit it .
are we passing inspection ?
safeties all going green .
countdown started .
nanomeds released .
four seconds .
okay .
nanomeds fully dispersed .
okay .
let' s hit freddie with the gamma radiation .
gamma exposure .
nanomeds now active .
nanomeds replicating cells on border .
it' s working .
cell copy to disassemble ratio holding within 1 % .
harper : lmbalanced nanomed activity .
you want to tell the review board that we' ve developed ... a brand new method for exploding frogs ?
yeah .
i think maybe there' s a market for it .
what if there' s a plague ?
what have you had , betty , like one beer ?
i' m just saying , you know , frogs start falling from the sky ... who do they come to ?
we' d be world renowned .
make any parent proud .
i bet they would be .
they actually did want me to be a scientist .
i mean your birth parents .
i guess we' il never know .
i don' t understand why you don' t want to find out about them .
they' re dead .
they died before i could remember anything , any ....
why do you always come back to this ?
i don' t know .
i guess i figure there' s more to you than you like to show .
i guess there couldn' t be any less .
right .
so now we come full circle back to that .
nice work , betty .
betty .
glenn .
hi .
hi .
what happened to your uniform ?
i switched over .
i' m still working with your father ... but the military' s subcontracting the most interesting work ... and i can' t argue with the paycheck .
i basically run all the labs on the base now .
you' re looking good .
... you' re the genetics expert .
the good old college days .
so , how' s business ?
what do you want ?
all right , i' il cut to the chase .
i' ve heard interesting things about what you guys are doing .
your little molecular machines have some incredible implications .
how' d you like to come work for atheon ... get paid 10 times as much as you are now ... and own a piece of the patents ?
you just have to say the word .
two words : the door .
general ?
come in .
talbot wanted you to see this , sir .
it' s about a lab atheon is targeting to acquire and move to desert base .
why isn' t he going through nsc ?
it concerns your daughter , sir .
what happened to benny ?
he' s not working the night shift ?
benny' s dead .
i' m the new guy .
good to meet you .
same .
let' s try another .
no , stay here .
i look tired anyway .
yeah , but you look great .
what' s the matter ?
it' s these dreams , doctor .
i keep having them and they' re terrible .
tell me about your dream .
it starts ... with a memory .
i think it' s my first memory .
it' s this image i have ... from when i was maybe two years old .
do you think it' s just a dream ?
no , i think it' s something that happened ... when i was living at a desert base with my father .
anyhow , the dream goes on ... and suddenly i' m alone .
that' s terrible .
you know i' d never hurt you .
hey there .
what' s your name , darling ?
okay .
it' s okay .
i gotta talk to you , edith .
bruce , stay here .
c , t , g , a ...
g.
bruce .
my bruce .
morning .
glenn dropped by .
what' s he doing here ?
you know , dr. krenzler ... we' ve never had the chance to get to know each other properly .
it' s because i don' t want to get to know you , properly or improperly .
so leave .
hey , no worries .
you know , let me give you a little heads up .
there is a hair' s breadth between friendly offer and hostile takeover .
i' ve done my homework .
the work you' re doing here is dynamite .
gl' s embedded with technology ... that makes them instantly repairable on the battlefield ... in our sole possession .
that' s a hell of a business .
it' s not what we' re doing here .
we' re doing the basic science for everyone .
when stupid ldeals happen to smart penniless scientists .
ln the meantime , bruce , you will be hearing from me .
about glenn .
there' s nothing to talk about .
i just wanted to say , don' t worry about him .
i' il handle it .
how ?
i' m gonna call my father .
ask him to exert some pressure .
last i heard , you and your father weren' t speaking .
i guess now i have something to talk with him about .
i think this circuit' s fried .
i don' t know .
maybe you want to come take a look at it .
okay , i' il be right there .
the gamma' s too high !
bruce , i can' t stop it !
harper , get out !
get out !
how' s harper ?
he' s all right .
you saved him .
i don' t think he' s coming back to the lab for a while , though .
i don' t understand how this is possible .
you should be dead .
they worked .
the nanomeds .
i feel great .
i feel like ...
i don' t know , they must have fixed me .
they' ve killed everything else that they' ve come in contact with .
are you sure the doctor checked
the doctor gave me the full workup .
he wants to know where he can get what i' m taking .
i' m 100 % .
more .
what do you mean ?
remember my bad knee ?
now it' s my good knee .
bruce , this isn' t funny .
i was watching you .
you were gonna die and i was gonna have to watch you die .
i' m sorry .
really .
i am not gonna explode , okay ?
yeah .
you should get some rest .
i' m fine , really .
i' ve never felt better .
your name is not krenzler .
it' s banner .
what ?
your name .
it' s banner .
bruce banner .
how did you get in here ?
i work here now .
ln the labs .
the late shift .
it keeps me close to you .
you always work so late yourself with your friend , miss ross .
no , please .
let me .
you' re not well .
you' ve had a terrible accident .
you' re wondering why you' re still alive .
you' re thinking there' s something inside .
something different .
lnexplicable .
i can help you understand , if you let me .
lf you' il ... forgive me .
look , mister ...
i' m sure i have nothing to forgive you for ... so perhaps you should leave now .
i' il be fine .
you must know .
you may not want to believe it , but i can see it ... in your eyes .
so much like your mother' s .
of course you' re my flesh and blood ... but then you' re something else , too , aren' t you ?
my physical son ... but the child of my mind , too .
no .
you' re lying .
my parents died when i was a small boy .
no , that' s not true .
that' s what they wanted you to believe .
the experiments , the accident , all top secret .
they put me away for 30 years .
30 years .
away from you .
away from our work .
but they couldn' t keep me forever .
i' m sane .
they had to admit it .
you see ... everything your extraordinary mind ... has been seeking all these years ... it' s been inside you .
now we will understand it .
we will harness it .
don' t answer .
it' s miss ross again .
there' s something you need to know about her , bruce ... something troublesome .
let me protect you from her .
no .
get out .
get out !
sit !
we' re gonna have to watch that temper of yours .
sure you' re okay ?
yeah , just glad to be out of bed .
i got a message from my father .
he' s coming to see me .
your father ?
when ?
he lands in about an hour .
the funny thing is , he called me .
hi , dad .
hello , betty .
here , ma' am .
thanks .
you' re welcome .
sir .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
look , i' m gonna get right to it .
it' s about glenn , isn' t it ?
he' s been snooping around my lab .
glenn noticed some things .
he asked me to make some inquiries .
are you here to question me ?
no .
we' ve turned up some surprising things .
this krenzler you work with ... do you know who he really is ?
how much do you actually know about him ?
i think the question is ... what is it that you know about him ?
i' m not at liberty to
not at liberty to disclose it to me .
right .
you know , i think i was hoping ... that maybe this time you just honestly wanted to see me again .
you' ve got this all wrong , betty .
do l ?
yes .
i do want to see you .
i really wish that i could believe you .
everything your extraordinary mind ... has been seeking all these years ... it' s been inside you .
this is dr. krenzler .
please leave a message and i' il call you right back .
bruce , hey .
are you there ?
look , i think i screwed up .
my father , it' s like he suspects you of something .
i was so impatient , like always ...
i didn' t hear him out .
i don' t know .
i just think they' re planning something with the lab .
so call me , okay ?
bye .
betty !
dispatch !
we have a 4 15 at the lab !
send the berkeley p. d. now !
what' s going on ?
i gotta talk to you .
bruce , stay here .
my bruce .
bruce ?
there was some sort of explosion .
they wouldn' t let us into the building .
i was worried about you .
i' m okay .
what happened to you last night ?
i had the most vivid dream .
it was like being born .
coming up for air .
light hitting my face .
screaming .
my heartbeat was like ... boom ... boom ... boom .
were you at the lab ?
no .
but something ....
and there was that man .
the one with the dogs .
who ?
that new janitor .
he said he was my father .
i' il get it .
my father .
my , my .
so this is the young bruce banner .
krenzler .
i think you left something in your lab last night .
mitchell .
escort my daughter outside .
i' il join her shortly .
i' d rather stay here .
now , betty .
it' s okay .
i' il be fine .
keep him under observation .
i' il be back .
what ?
your friend in there ... there' s a good chance he' s caught up in some bad business .
unfinished business .
i promise you , i' m going to get to the bottom of it .
you have my word i' il make sure he' s cared for .
but as of right now , he' s incommunicado .
for the next few days at least ... you' re going to stay away from here , for your own good .
and that' s for the new guy on the night shift ?
great .
thank you .
i appreciate it .
how unexpected .
please , come in .
i' m sorry to show up at your house like this .
i came to ask you something ... that i really have no business asking .
he told you ?
he said you talked to him .
please , sit down .
bruce was at the lab last night .
he said that you were there , too , but he can' t remember much about it .
i need to find out what happened .
so you want to know what' s wrong with him .
so you can fix him .
cure him .
change him .
my father' s with the military .
he thinks he' s involved in some kind of threat to national security .
your father , ross .
you brought your father down upon his head .
how little you understand , miss ross .
and how dangerous your ignorance has become .
i' m sorry ?
don' t be sorry .
my son is ... unique .
that' s why you can' t relate to him .
and because he is unique ... the world will not tolerate his existence , will they ?
but you ... you try , don' t you ?
and a very beautiful woman like you ... your attentions ... can' t be completely unwanted ... can they ?
no .
not with eyes like yours ... watching expectantly , lovingly .
but i' m afraid we' re both too late to help him .
there' s nothing i can do for him , or for you .
besides ... he' s made it clear he wants nothing to do with me .
his choice .
now if you' il excuse me , miss ross , i have some work to do .
and don' t worry about the dogs .
you' il be fine .
just don' t look them in the eyes .
goodbye .
he gets released , and a month later your lab is destroyed .
what a coincidence .
so , you' re just not gonna tell me where he is , are you ?
how many times must i tell you ...
i want to help you , but i don' t know .
you know who i am , right , banner ?
you' re betty' s father , a high ranking general .
let' s cut the crap .
i' m the guy who had your father tossed away .
i' il do the same with you if i feel so disposed , you understand ?
lf you had him tossed away , why ask me ?
i don' t remember .
i was always told my father was dead .
don' t play with me !
you were four years old when you saw it !
when i saw what ?
you were right there !
who could forget a thing like that ?
what ?
some more repressed memories .
just tell me .
i' m sorry , son .
you' re an even more screwed up mess than i thought you' d be .
till we get to the bottom of this ... your lab has been declared a top secret military site ... and you won' t get security clearance to get back into it ... or any other lab that' s doing anything more interesting than ... trying to figure out the next generation of herbal hair gel .
lf you ever come within a thousand yards ... of my daughter again ...
i' il put you away for the rest of your natural life .
dogs ?
go !
go get her !
and let nothing stand in your way !
hello ?
bruce ?
so , they think they can just throw you away , as they did me .
what' s wrong with me ?
what did you do to me ?
i had a visit today .
a very unwelcome visit .
i' m afraid my hand is being forced .
what did you do to me ?
you so much want to know , don' t you ?
but no explanation will serve you half as well as experience .
ln any case , i still don' t quite understand it myself .
lf they' d only let me work in peace .
but , of course , my betters would have none of that .
so you experimented on yourself , didn' t you ?
and passed on to me , what ?
an alteration .
genetic .
a deformity , i guess you could call it that .
but an amazing strength , too .
and now , finally unleashed , i can harvest it .
no .
you' il do no such thing .
i' il isolate it and treat myself .
i' il remove it and kill it before it does any real harm .
i bet you and your betty would love to destroy it .
but would you really destroy part of yourself ?
i don' t think so .
and as for betty ...
i' m sending her a surprise visit from my four legged friends .
you see , i' ve managed to culture some of your very own dna , bruce ... and the results are tremendous .
they' re unstable , but very powerful .
what about my dna ?
let' s just wait and see what betty makes of the result .
no .
you' re crazy .
i won' t let you .
get your hands off me !
lnside , asshole !
i want to talk to you .
my father' s going after betty .
do you think you can go behind my back ... and get ross to cut me out ?
listen to me !
betty' s in trouble !
you pathetic freak .
betty' s in danger , i swear to you .
lf i can state the obvious , something tells me ... you aren' t in much of a position to be making stupid threats to anyone .
talbot .
yeah ?
you' re making me angry .
am l ?
open fire !
bruce ?
he sent his dogs , didn' t he ?
but i killed them .
oh , my god .
it must be the nanomeds .
it must be the gamma exposure .
but we' ve never seen any effect like this before .
no .
deeper .
the gamma just unleashed what was already there .
unleashed what ?
me .
lt .
it' s okay .
what were those animals ?
my father sent them .
he is my father .
he wanted me to change .
he wanted me to change into that mindless hulk .
and why would he want that ?
can you remember anything ?
ls there anything from when you were changed ?
it was like a dream .
about what ?
rage .
power .
and freedom .
hello .
sir .
hello .
dad ?
betty , are you all right ?
i' m scared .
i need your help .
where are you ?
how are you ?
okay , i guess .
i think that somehow your anger is triggering the nanomeds .
how could it ?
we designed them to respond to physical damage .
emotional damage can manifest physically .
like what ?
serious trauma .
repressed memories .
your father grilled me about something ... that happened to me from early childhood ... that i' m supposed to remember .
he did ?
it sounded bad ... but i honestly don' t remember .
the thing that worries me ... is a physical wound is finite .
but with emotions , what' s to say that it won' t just go on and on ... and start a chain reaction ?
you know what scares me the most ?
ls that when it happens ... when it comes over me and i totally lose control ...
i like it .
it' s okay , i' ve got you .
i' m sorry .
you' il be okay .
it' s just to make you sleep .
target down .
target secure .
i' m gonna take you someplace safe , okay ?
bruce .
bruce .
attention on deck .
carry on .
we' re buried out here in the middle of nowhere .
how long are you gonna keep him sedated ?
for the rest of his natural life , if i have to .
you said i could trust you .
i' m your father .
trust me to do what i think is right ... not what you think you want .
he is a human being .
he is also something else .
suppose he gets out ... and has one of his little mood swings in a populated area ?
yes , i' m aware of the potential danger .
i' m also aware that he saved my life .
yeah , from a mutant french poodle .
i' m indebted to him for that .
he also put three men in a hospital , and talbot' s barely walking .
i mean , what do you want me to do ?
i want you to help him !
why is he such a threat to you ?
because i know what he comes from .
he is his father' s son , every last molecule of him .
he says he doesn' t know his father .
but he' s working in the same , exact goddamn field his father did .
so either he' s lying , or it' s something worse ...
ross : and he' s ....
what ?
predestined to follow in his father' s footsteps ?
i was going to say " damned .
of course you were .
but i' m a scientist , and as a scientist ...
i believe we can figure this out and he can be helped .
i know you do .
look , whether you know or care ...
i' ve got a lot of pride in what you' ve done .
but this is too big for you .
look , i know the government thinks they have a weapon on their hands ... otherwise , he' d be dead by now .
they can probe and prod all they want .
meanwhile , let me try to help him .
nobody knows him better than i do .
what did david banner do to him ?
cover left !
cover right !
what' s happening here ?
my hand .
you see , the strength of my son' s dna ... combined with nanomed reconstruction ....
you see , i can partake with the essences of all things .
i' m gonna have to ask you to put your hands up , pal , okay ?
nice and easy .
do you really believe that i am separate from you ?
where am l ?
you' re home .
it' s hard to believe we used to live here .
i must have seen you or known you .
lf only i could remember .
this is my old house , isn' t it ?
let' s go .
please try .
what is it ?
nothing .
really ?
damn it .
okay , betty .
what do you want to know ?
what was in that room ?
what are you afraid that i' il see ?
see ?
there' s nothing .
it' s empty .
what do you mean i don' t have access to him ?
nsa has decided to turn over study of the threat ... to atheon .
but you' re head of the base .
i thought you were in charge .
i don' t set policy .
and i still take orders .
i can' t believe talbot would go around me like this !
there' s a lot of powerful people who want in on this ... and money to be made , lots of it .
know the worst part about all this ?
when i had david banner locked up and sent that kid away ...
i didn' t give the boy a second thought .
he was just collateral damage .
he isn' t anymore , is he ?
what can i do ?
you can go home now .
i' d tell you to go and say goodbye , but i' ve already been informed ... that for now all further contact is out of the question .
right .
hi , bruce .
how you feeling ?
the grub okay here for you ?
what do you want ?
that' s a good question .
i need your cells to trigger some chemical distress signals ... so you can turn a little green for me again ... and i can carve off a piece of the real you ... analyze it , patent it and make a fortune .
you mind ?
i' il never let you .
i' m not sure you' ve got much of a choice .
come on , aren' t you feeling a little angry ?
after all , you' ve only got me to play with ... now that betty' s dumped you and gone back to berkeley .
you' re lying .
you know , for me , this is a win win situation .
you turn green , all these guys come in and kill you ... and i perform the autopsy .
you don' t ... and i mop the floor with you ... and maybe by accident go too far and break your neck .
it' s bad science , maybe ... but personally gratifying .
come on , bruce .
let' s see what you got .
never .
you know , consciously , you may control it ... but subconsciously , i bet that' s another story .
all right , let' s jump start those brain waves .
my dear miss ross , welcome back .
there are two guards right outside .
you don' t have to worry .
i' m not angry with you , not anymore .
what do you want ?
it' s over for me now , i know that .
and soon it will be over for bruce .
that' s why i' ve come to you , to ask you ... if you could persuade your father ... as a man , as a father himself ... that if i turn myself in now , peacefully ... and before he puts me away forever ... that he would let me see my son ... for one last time .
could you do that for me ?
it' s out of my father' s hands now .
i understand .
he' s a puppet now .
i don' t blame him .
you shouldn' t .
you should blame yourself for what you' ve done to your son .
and what have i done to my son , miss ross ?
nothing .
i tried to improve on the limits in myself .
myself , not him .
can you understand ?
to improve on nature .
my nature .
knowledge of oneself .
it' s the only path to the truth ... that gives men the power to go beyond god' s boundaries .
you know what' s beyond your boundaries ?
other people .
all you' ve given bruce is fear .
a fear of life .
fear ?
perhaps , miss ross .
and loneliness , too .
yes .
i feel them both .
but i have lived ... completely once .
i was so much in love .
and she so much wanted a baby ... my baby .
i could tell from the moment she conceived ... that it wasn' t a son i had given her ... but something else .
a monster , maybe .
i should have put a stop to it right then ... but i was curious ... and that was my downfall .
and as i watched this tiny life unfold ...
i began to imagine the horror of it ... and my curiosity was replaced ... with compassion .
but they took away my chance to cure him .
your father threw me out .
i remember that day so well ... every moment , every sensation .
walking into the house ... the feeling of the handle of the knife in my hand .
i knew i was doing a father' s work ... fulfilling a father' s mercy .
david , please stop it !
no !
david , talk to me !
but then she surprised me .
it was as if ... she and the knife ... merged .
go !
you cannot imagine ... the unbearable finality of it .
and in that one moment ...
i took everything that was dear to me ... and transformed it ... into nothing more than a memory .
bingo !
that must be some jumbo nightmare he just had .
do it now .
start the enzyme extraction .
sir , negative on drill penetration .
damn it , drill him harder .
give me full rpms .
come on .
should i neutralize ?
no !
i can' t do anything with goop .
come on !
all right , put him to sleep .
it' s not stopping him !
ready room , send in our containment team , non lethals only .
i repeat , non lethals only .
i must have a sample of him .
sir !
jesus .
use the foam .
deploy containment foam .
talbot , talk to me .
cease fire !
under control , general .
i' il let you know if we need you .
unacceptable .
unseat your asses down there immediately .
i want a full evacuation now .
i' m shutting you down .
lock down .
didn' t you hear the general ?
i said lock down !
clear !
i need a sample of him !
all right , take it easy there , buddy .
this might give you a bit of a sting here , bruce .
fall back !
clear your weapon !
give me the m2 .
so long , big boy .
clear !
lock down the entire facility immediately .
target still moving towards blue level .
evacuate the main hall .
send in backup , heavy weapons .

in the meantime , if he does anything but sit in that chair ... we' il turn on the juice and he' il be incinerated immediately .
we' ve established a 200 yard perimeter , sir .
lf we deploy the electromagnetic array ... there should be no collateral damage .
i' m doing this for you , betty .
but one way or another , we' re gonna have to prepare for the worst .
i should have killed you .
as i should have killed you .

i saw her last night .
saw her face .
brown hair ... brown eyes .
she smiled at me .
she reached down and kissed my cheek .
i can almost remember a smell .
it was like desert flowers .
her favorite perfume .
it' s my mother ... and i don' t even know her name .
it' s all right , son .
go ahead and cry .
cry .
crying will do you good .
don' t touch me !
maybe once you were my father .
but you' re not now and you never will be .
ls that so ?
well , i got news for you .
i didn' t come here to see you .
i came here to see my son .
my real son .
the one inside of you .
you' re nothing but a superficial shell ... a husk of flimsy consciousness ... ready to be torn off at a moment' s notice .
you can think what you like .
i don' t care .
just go .
no , son , listen to me .
i found a cure .
for me .
my cells can transform , too ... absorb enormous amounts of energy .
but , unlike you , they' re unstable .
son ...
i need your strength .
i gave you life .
now you must give it back to me ... only a million times more radiant ... more powerful .
stop !
stop what ?
stop what ?
think of all those men out there in their uniforms ... barking and swallowing orders !
lnflicting their petty rule over the entire globe !
think of all the harm they' ve done !
to you !
to me !
to humanity !
and know this , that we can make them ... and their flags , their anthems and their governments ... disappear in a flash !
you in me .
i' d rather die .
that' s your answer ?
then indeed you shall die ... and be reborn a hero ... of the kind that walked the earth ...
long before the pale religions of civilization ... infected humanity' s soul !
go !
stop your bawling ... you weak little speck of human trash .
i' il go .
you just watch me go !
hit it !
hit it again .
we can' t , sir .
there' s no power .
some kind of counter electromagnetic field .
move in and assault the target .
move in !
sir , i' ve located them on radar .
pear lake .
call up the task force .
yes .
that' s right .
keep fighting .
the more you fight , the more of you i take .
strange .
we' re reading a phenomenal drop in temperatures there ... with simultaneous radiological activity .
they' re absorbing all the ambient energy .
relax .
sleep now , bruce , and forget forever .
struggle no more ... and give me all of your power .
you think you can live with it ?
take it !
take it all !
yes .
take it back .
it' s not stopping !
take it back !
gentlemen , release .
gamma charge away .
sweet dreams .
one year later ...
hello ?
betty ?
is that you ?
hi , dad .
i' m glad i caught you .
i' m glad you called .
thanks .
look , betty ... you and i ....
we both know that bruce ... couldn' t have survived that blast .
but ....
well , you know ....
what is it ?
you know , the usual loonies ... seeing things , only now everything' s green .
right .
look ... if by some chance he did survive ... and he should try to contact you , and try to get in touch ... you' d tell me , wouldn' t you ?
no .
i wouldn' t .
but you know as well as i do i wouldn' t have to .
i mean , my phones are bugged ... my computer is tapped , i' m under surveillance .
i' il tell you , though ... that if he were alive ...
i' m the last person i would want him to come to ... because , as much as i miss him ....
i loved him .
i' m sorry , betty .
i am so sorry .
i know you are .
listen to your father and take your medicine , okay ?
take all the medicine .
quiet !
sit down !
shut up !
we need these medicines for the people who live here .
who are you to decide what the people need ?
these people are helping our enemies .
and maybe you are too .
take all this .
it is the property of the government .
you' re making me angry .
you wouldn' t like me when i' m angry .
