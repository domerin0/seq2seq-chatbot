i know .
i see you .
and i don' t like it .
where' s your little servant girl ?
ruby .

her nose is in the butter .
her nose is right in your butter !
this farm' s got my name on it !
you listenin ' , woman ?
you' re gonna need more than a scarecrow !
sal .
afternoon .
don' t spread out .
why are they spreadin ' out ?
i never seen a man work a field with a shotgun before .
there' s a war on .
get off my land .
your boys come home ?
ain' t seen my boys in four years .
they' re out fightin ' other boys , not old men and women .
so you won' t mind if we look around ?
' cause we think they' re here .
we think you' ve got ' em hid up somewhere .
what i gotta give you ?
chicken ?
lamb ?
sure .
the thing is , you' ve only got one barrel .
and there' s five of us .
that' s not a fair fight .
king of kings !
hey !
what was that ?
you' re harboring deserters .
i could confiscate this farm and everything on it .
every plate , every sheep , every little pellet of chickenshit .
i could confiscate your old lady' s asshole .
so don' t you offer me no bird .
come on , boys !
mama' s callin ' !
mama !

god won' t let it ... stand this way long .
how long have i been sleepin ' ?
two days , three days .
not long enough .
i can' t stop here .
sit down before you fall down .
i' m a deserter .
if they find me here , things could be bad for you .
what are they gonna do ?
cut short my young life ?
i' ve learned a person can pretty much survive off of a goat .
a goat gives you company , and milk , and cheese , and , when you need it , good meat .
that' s my beauty .
there' s my beauty .
so you been fightin ' .
i could be at killin ' ... for days , my feet against the feet of my enemy .
and i always killed him .
he never killed me .
i don' t know why .
gave it a try , to look at ya .
yeah , i guess he did .
see , i think there' s a plan .
there' s a design for each and every one of us .
you look at nature .
bird flies somewhere , picks up a seed , shits the seed out , plant grows .
bird' s got a job , shit' s got a job , seed' s got a job .
and you' ve got a job .
you done good , goat .
you were a real beauty .
sometimes i think i' m crazy when i' m just hungry .
now drink this .
it eases the pain , and you' il sleep .
is she waitin ' for ya , this ada monroe ?
she was .
i don' t know .
or even if she knows me .
lie down .
i' m like the boy who goes for wood in winter and comes back in spring with a whistle .
like every fool sent off to fight with a flag and a lie .
that' s the laudanum gettin ' to ya .
that' s good .
say somethin ' more .
she got me a book .
ada monroe .
a man by the name of bartram .
he wrote about his travels .
sometimes ... just readin ' the name of a place ... near home ...
sorell cove .
bishop' s creek .
those places belonged to people before us .
to the cherokee .
what did he call cold mountain ?
how could a name ... not even a real name ... break your heart ?
it' s her .
she' s the place i' m headin ' .
and i hardly know her .
i hardly know her !
and i just can' t seem to get back to her .
to have traveled so far .
from east to west .
a thousand terrible miles .
i have to close my eyes .
my feet treadin ' all god' s surface
his ocean .
his swamps .
his slopes and ridges
to find myself .
at last .
a mark in the aching snow .
from whence i beheld through a blue haze a world of mountains piled upon mountains .
ada !
ada !
it' s a man !
what is ?
raidin ' our corncrib !
got him in the trap !
that' s him yelpin ' !
help !
here .
help !
damn .
listen up !
you got ...
aim !
you got a barrel trained on your rear end !
get me outta this dang thing !
you got a weapon ?
no , ma' am .
i' m ...
my fists are about to drop off .
unbelievable .
stobrod thewes !
ruby ?
that' s my daddy .
just so' s you know , i can eat while she' s doin ' this .
just so' s you know , you ain' t eatin ' inside .
number one , they hang people round here for takin ' in deserters .
number two , even if they was givin ' out prizes , you' d still eat outside .
you' re scarred .
i' m what ?
your heart .
scarred .
i did wrong to ya .
you' d be scarred .
you' d be real scarred if i hadn' t wrapped them trap teeth in sackin ' .
which was my idea .
which was her idea .
i hurt you .
good god .
i made up 50 tunes with you in mind .
ruby this , ruby that , ruby with the eyes that sparkle .
hey !
let' s agree .
you beat me , you abandoned me , you ignored me , then you beat me some more .
and all of that is better' n " ruby with the eyes that sparkle .
i' m changed .
people change .
war changes people somethin ' terrible .
ruby' s told you , i' ve no doubt , i wasn' t always the best .
you were an asshole !
i can' t disagree with that .
i was .
would you get him outta here ?
music' s changed me .
i' m full of music , ruby .
i wish i' d brung my fiddle .
hey , ruby , i got a new fiddle .
oh , it' s a beautiful fiddle .
it' s full of tunes , ruby .
i didn' t know i had it in me .
you' re all set .
i ...
bless you both .
all right , then .
ain' t you got a proper coat ?
aw , darlin ' , i' m fine , you know .
and you just say the word , i won' t come back neither .
don' t wanna put you or your mistress here in any bother .
i' m not ruby' s employer .
oh .
beg pardon .
nobody is .
oh .
you know who really needs a coat , darlin ' ?
my partner .
fat boy name of pangle .
we' re hidin ' up in a cave with a singer from georgia , and pangle , he feels the cold like a thin man , but there ain' t no coat' il fit him .
i love you , ruby .
in case the sky falls on our head .
you always were a good girl .
ooh !
he' s so full of manure , that man .
we could lay him in the dirt and ... grow another one just like him .
that' s medicine , that' s goat meat .
and you' re sick of both .
i have a deal to thank you for .
that' s just for show .
# ruby with the eyes that sparkle
get on back where you came from !
thank you for my coat !
thanks for the food !
git ! # ruby with the eyes that sparkle !
i love my coat !
my love for linton is like the foliage in the woods .
time will change it .
i' m well aware .
as winter changes the trees .
my love for heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath .
a source of little visible delight ,
but necessary .
he' s always ... always in my mind .
she ain' t gonna marry linton , is she ?
you can' t say that about heathcliff and then marry linton .
hmm .
we' il find out .
tomorrow .
i' m not waitin ' till tomorrow !
ruby ...
a source of ... little visible delight , but ... necessary .
i like that .
i' m a confederate soldier ... on furlough .
i need shelter ... and food .
i' ve got a rifle !
fair enough .
i have some beans and corn pone .
all i got .
thank you .
i' m alone here , as you can see , with my baby .
i need to believe you mean no harm .
no .
i don' t want it .
if i had my way , they' d take metal altogether out of this world .
every blade , every gun .
it' s all right .
you' re burnin ' up , little man .
is your baby sick ?
my man' s dead .
took his wound at gettysburg and never saw his boy .
i' m sorry .
it' s pretty much what you' il get if you knock on any door of this war .
man dead , woman left .
it' s mean food , but it' s hot .
there' s been no huntin ' on the road , just cress and roots .
i need to try and feed this man .
you gotta eat somethin ' , baby .
he won' t feed .
i' m inman , by the way .
that' s my name .
i' m sara .
my baby' s ethan .
glad to know you both .
you look about his size .
he was another man straight up and down .
thank you .
everything fit ?
these boots are good boots .
well , i' il say good night , then .

fellas , what' s the rush ?
if ruby finds out we' ve spent the night , there' il be hell to pay .
my love .
where are you ?
with no hope of reaching you .
i write to you .
as i always do .
as i have always done .
# i' m alone .
but i don' t worry
# ' cause i' m sittin ' on top of the world
you reckon we could eat this ?
hey .

it' s froze .
how long it been there for ?

yeah .
not very long .
good evenin ' .
hope we didn' t disturb you .
d' you mind if i warm myself by your fire ?
name' s teague .
do i know you ?
stobrod thewes .
that your wife ?
that' s a " he .
is " he " your wife ?
we' re musicians .
he picks a banjo , i got a fiddle .
your sweetheart' s got a nice piece of flesh on him .
he looks pretty romantic by the fire .
it' s a picture of love .
you gonna play that fiddle ?
sure .
sure .
hey , wake up .
evenin ' , missis .
where' s georgia ?
" where' s georgia " ?
captain teague wants us to play now .
love to .
we heard there were some deserters up in these parts hidden out in a big cave .
not come to my ears .
so you don' t know where this big cave is ?
no , sir .
you do , stobs .
he means ...
no , right .
no , no .
there is a cave right up near bearpen branch .
we played some music up there .
never occurred to me they were outliers .
it ain' t nowhere near bearpen branch .
he' s always gettin ' lost .
that cave we live there .
i used to freeze up in that cave till i got gived this new coat .
ruby made me this coat .
i like my coat .
this part belonged to a reverend and this part belonged to a horse .
ruby said what is it ? i should pray or neigh , dependin ' .
he don' t ... he don' t know what he' s sayin ' .
he got a mind no bigger than a pickled walnut .
it' s a good coat .
# i wish .
i wish my baby was born
# and sittin ' on its papa' s knee
# and me .
poor girl
# and me .
poor girl .
were dead and gone
# and the green grass growin ' o' er my feet
# i ain' t ahead .
nor never will be
# till the sweet apple grows on a sour apple tree
# the owl .
the owl
# is a lonely bird
# it chills my heart
# with dread and terror
# that someone' s blood
# someone' s blood
# there on his wing
# that someone' s blood
# there on his ... feather
broke my young heart .
we gonna be here all night ?
stand over there .
ruby , she don' t know one end of the war from the other .
you don' t have to worry yourself about her , is what i' m sayin ' .
or ada , neither .
you know what i' m sayin ' ?
you too .
you stand over there .
we gonna get our tintype made ?
don' t smile .
what ?
quit smilin ' .
he always smiles .
he don' t mean nothin ' by it .
i told him , there ain' t nothin ' in this world worth a smile !
put your hat over your face .
cover your face with your hat .
ruby !
what ?
ruby !
what' s wrong ?
teague ...
the home guard ...
what ?
they shot your daddy !
they shot your daddy , and pangle too !
i told georgia he can stop here .
i told him he can sleep in the barn .
he' s got nothin ' inside him .
he' il walk out of here and die in the snow .
he can milk the cows .
i was worried about that .
it' s five hours ' climb from here .
he drew a map .
i' m ready .
you know them fools stayed the night in the mill ?
that' s stobrod thewes .
can' t do one good thing without addin ' the bad .
left tracks in the snow all the way up for the home guard to follow .
sign that says " shoot me .
ruby ...
ruby .
i' m sorry .
every piece of this is man' s bullshit .
they call this war a cloud over the land , but they made the weather , and then they stand in the rain and say " shit , it' s rainin ' !
if i cry one tear for my daddy , i stole it off a crocodile .
all right , then .
all right , then .
dear god .
oh , dear god .
he ain' t here .
teague' s probably took him .
they did that with the swanger boys , didn' t they ?
strung ' em up , as a warnin ' .
they took his coat .
why would they take his coat ?
daddy ?
daddy !
daddy !
daddy ?
he' s still breathin ' !
it' s ruby !
don' t you die on me again !
we gotta get him home .
he won' t make it .
he' il die first .
he' s got hardly no blood left in him .
there it is .
i feel it .
you got it ?
yep .
there' s a place close .
old cherokee .
it used to be .
it' s got shelter .
water .
i used to hide up there when he' d get a temper goin ' .
god !
i' il go look for some food .
take the shotgun .
goddamn .
turn around !
go back where you came from !
go back !
ada ?
ada monroe ?
turn around or i' il shoot !
inman ?
inman ?
inman .
you better come with me .
ruby .
this is inman .
oh !
congratulations !
oughta send you out with a shotgun a lot more !
looks if he' s about to topple over .
i may need to .
you shot or somethin ' ?
not lately .
he' s asleep .
i ain' t surprised .
your man looked tuckered out .
i saw him .
in sally swanger' s well .
a man like a black smudge in the snow .
well , there you go .
it wasn' t the same , what i saw .
in the well it was as if he were falling .
you probably just don' t remember it right .
i remember it exactly .
there were crows black crows .
they were flyin ' towards me .
ruby , i thought i was seein ' him fall .
instead , i was seein ' him come back to me .
i got big plans for that farm .
i know .
i know you have .
i got a vision in my mind of how black cove oughta be .
i don' t know , ruby .
all this while i' ve been packin ' ice around my heart .
how do i make it melt ?
hey !
you about done with my knife ?
we got a bird to cook .
just about .
you' re makin ' a pig' s ear of that job .
give it to me .
oh , i ain' t gonna cut you .
can' t see that it' d make a bit of difference if i did .
you got the right feelings for her ?
don' t turn your head !
i do .
i' m sorry .
i was tryin ' to be quiet .
did you get my letters ?
i got three letters .
i carried them .
i carried them in the book you gave me .
the bartram .
i probably sent 103 .
did you write to me ?
whenever i could .
if you never got them , i can summarize .
no .
no , no .
" i pray you are well .
i pray i am in your thoughts .
you are all that keeps me from slidin ' into some dark place .
how did i keep you ?
we barely knew each other .
it was a few moments .
a thousand moments .
they' re like a bag ... of tiny diamonds .
don' t matter if they' re real or things i made up .
the shape of your neck .
that' s real .
the way you felt under my hands when i pulled you to me .
you were plowing a field .
you were carrying a tray .
you wouldn' t come in .
no , i wouldn' t go in .
so that' s why i had to carry a tray .
so i could come out to see you .
that kiss .
which i kissed every day of my walking .
every day i was waiting .
longing .
longing to see your face .
if you could see my inside ...
now , whatever you wanna name it my spirit ?
that' s what i fear .
i think i' m ruined .
they kept tryin ' to put me in the ground .
but i wasn' t ready .
inman ...
but if i had ... if i had goodness , i lost it .
if i had anything tender in me , i shot it dead .
how could i write to you after what i done , what i seen ?
number one , shut this door .
it' s freezin ' .
number two , shut that door .
it' s freezin ' .
layin ' on my back , my fingers poked in my ears , tryin ' to shut out who' s got a bag of diamonds , who' s carrying a tray ...
if you wanna get three feet up a bull' s ass , just listen to what sweethearts whisper to one another .
in fact , if y' all gonna wimble wimble all night , i' m gonna sleep in with him .
i' il say good night .
no .
please ... don' t say good night .
wars make some things pointless .
it' s hard to imagine a wedding .
i think even my father would recognize that .
ada , i wanna marry you .
if you' il have me .
isn' t there some religion where you just have to say " i marry you " three times , and you' re man and wife ?
i marry you .
i marry you .
i marry you .
why is that funny ?
i think it' s " i divorce you " three times and you' re not married anymore .
i can wait for you .
oh , inman .
i marry you .
i marry you .
i marry you .
i marry you .
i marry you .
i have so ...
i have so many buttons .
sorry .
will you turn your back ?
no .
no , i will not .
i' il lead the horse at a pace your daddy can tolerate .
you two go ahead now .
no , i don' t wanna do that .
no .
we can all go together .
it' s safer this way .
we' re deserters .
no one has a quarrel with you .
he' s right .
i gather i ...
i need permission from you , ruby , if i reckon on livin ' at black cove .
all right , then .
you stay on that horse .
and don' t lose it .
or sell it .
gonna need it back on the farm .
all right , daddy .
i don' t wanna let you go .
i' il be with you by nightfall .
ugh .
all right , then .
hope that georgia boy' s been tendin ' to the animals .
i knew you were thinkin ' on him .
i was not !
i was thinkin ' on swollen udders .
oh !
and before you say " same difference " ...
i' m sayin ' nothin ' !
miss lovey dovey !
miss lovey dovey !
hey !
that was a long funeral for your daddy .
that was a wake .
that was irish .
now , your friend georgia here ...
we went down to visit you when we heard you were harborin ' deserters , and he told us after some persuasion you were up here .
we were up and down this mountain .
up and down .
there will be a reckoning .
when this war is over , there will be a reckoning .
did you make this coat ?
helpin ' a deserter that' s treason .
now , i know it' s half horse and half reverend .
a reckonin ' ?
the reckoning' s for your world .
it' s not mine .
i' i be damned .
he' s a hard bastard to kill .
no !
ruby !
inman !
captain teague !
come down from there !
no , sir .
here is fine .
i' il just shoot the horse out from under you .
you ridin ' captain teague' s animal ?
i am .
he dead ?
i hope so .
look , give me your gun and ride on home .
i' m done fightin ' .
i' m sick of it !
i give you my gun , you' re gonna shoot me dead .
i will not shoot you , but nor am i goin ' down this mountain lookin ' over my shoulder for you .
that' s what they call a conundrum .
i' il tell you what i got on my side .
what you got on your side ?
the confidence of youth .
inman !
no !
i ... came ... back .
i love you .
baby .
what we have lost will never be returned to us .
the land will not heal .
too much blood .
the heart will not heal .
all we can do is make peace with the past and try to learn from it .
what are you doing ?
he died in the night , love .
bring him here .
don' t kill him .
i' m not gonna kill him .
we have to try somethin ' or else he' s gonna die too .
it' s all right .
we' re gonna try a little trick .
there are days now when i manage not to think of you .
when the needs of the farm call with more urgency than my heart .
this time of year there' s so much life everywhere .
i find you in all of it .
as if you were still walking home to me .
if you could see us now this easter day at black cove .
you would know every step of your journey was worth it .
# i' m still climbing upwards
# and my journey' s almost ended
# so .
friend .
if you' re thirsty
# climb this mountain with me
grace inman , nobody said " eat .
for good friends , good food , good family , all our blessings , o lord , we thank thee .
amen .
amen .
amen .
amen .
amen !
sweetheart , there' s no cider .
that' s for you .
right .
i' d best ...
i' d best fetch it .
i got my orders .
i looked once more down sally' s well .
and this time there was nothin ' there to haunt me .
just clouds .
clouds .
and then ... sun .
# well i recall his parting words
# must i accept his fate
# or take myself far from this place ?
# i thought i heard a black bell toll
# a little bird did sing
# man has no choice
# when he wants every thing
# we' il rise above the scarlet tide
# that trickles down through the mountain
# and separates the widow from the bride
# man goes beyond his own decision
# gets caught up in the mechanism
# of swindlers who act like kings
# and brokers who break everything
# the dark of night was swiftly fading
# close to the dawn of day
# why would i want him just to lose him again ?
# we' il rise above the scarlet tide
# that trickles down through the mountain
# and separates the widow from the bride
# you' il walk unscathed through musket fire
# no plowman' s blade will cut thee down
# no cutler' s horn will mark thy face
# and you will be my ain true love
# and you will be my ain true love
# and as you walk through death' s dark veil
# the cannon' s thunder can' t prevail
# and those who hunt thee down will fail
# and you will be my ain true love
# and you will be my ain true love
# asleep inside the cannon' s mouth
# the captain cries " here comes the rout
# they' il seek to find me north and south
# i' ve gone to find my ain true love
# the field is cut and bleeds to red
# the cannonballs fly round my head
# the infirmary man may count me dead
# when i' ve gone to find my ain true love
# i' ve gone to find my ain true love
