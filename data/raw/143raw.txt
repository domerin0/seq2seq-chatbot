ruger mini 14 , 223 calibre .
it comes in a fetching chrome .
20 rounds per banana .
unless the elite and snazzy lki special takes your fancy , extending your capacity to 40 .
we' ve got a czechoslovakian ...
cz 83 , i' il take one .
oh ...
well , that' s young felix' s weapon of choice , isn' t it ?
now , there' s a trip down memory lane .
i' m partial to a bit of sentiment , me .
i' ve heard things , you know .
he misses you .
so , what are you going to take ?
i' il take the beretta , the cz , an ankle holster , add the mini 14 and i' m done .
i want to get in and out fast .
don' t we all ?
does durant still do his deals at the port hotel ?
silly lad .
it' il be his undoing , one of these days .
but what do you expect from a fella who gets his arse waxed every month ?
i forgot what a circus this place is .
funny , that .
i never did much like the circus .
all that poking your head in a lion' s mouth shit .
bring on the horses !
get ' em rogering the dancing girls !
that' s a circus .
these ... and these are on the house .
welcome home , ...
dawn .
there you go , mate .
thanks , mate .
ta .
what the fuck did they do to this fish ?
batter it to death ?
fish and chips .
the national dish , mate .
more like a national disaster .
keys .
twat .
come on .
so , err ...
how much are they paying you to wear that skirt ?
fag ?
no , motherfucker .
ah , mr mcelroy !
that' s daring , but very dashing attire .
let' s stick to the business in hand .
hey , come on !
mr mcelroy' s a guest of ours .
ok boys guns on the table please
felix ?
i' ve delivered him .
i' il have my tickets and be off .
ok .
put your gun on the table .
fuck .
the game' s tomorrow .
put your fucking gun on the table , you gobshit !
what ?
so , who' s the chemist ?
this is pudsey smith .
a first class man .
qualified and everything .
he can' t talk .
he' s been shot .
felix , have you shit your pants , or something ?
something doesn' t feel right , mr durant .
i know .
you' re making me nervous , for fuck' s sake !
sit on your hands , or something .
ok , mr mcelroy , the ball' s in your court .
mdma utilises serotonin
opiates like hero in utilise dopamine
sort of like the same sensation you get after sex .
amphetamines increase adrenaline and cocaine gets those synapses in the brain firing really fast .
my product is 51 times stronger than cocaine .
51 times more hallucinogenic than acid and 51 times more explosive than ecstasy .
it' s like a personal visit ... .. from god .
it' s that good ?
the dog' s bollocks .
felix desouza .
i count ten .
that' s right .
that' s one million sterling , or 1 ... 1 . 6 million dollars .
but that ain' t what we agreed on , is it ?
you' re 18 . 4 million dollars shy .
and i don' t care how you cut it , that' s a whole lot shy .
no ...
mr mcelroy , what we have there is a goodwill gesture .
a deposit .
a down payment .
one and a half million' s not a bad start , is it ?
i need to do some research .
i need to feed a few thousand to the kids , get some feedback .
you don' t think i can allow you to walk out of here with $20 million for a formula that only exists in your head ?
and all i get is what ?
an ointment for toe jam .
uh huh ?
market research .
right .
profile customers , send out questionnaires .
get out the bloody way , felix .
i can dig that .
but unless you' ve got what we agreed on , what the fuck am i doing here ?
give me a call when you' re ready to deal .
i fucking knew it .
room service .
that old fuckin ' chestnut .
aaargh !
hey hold it fellas !
it' s my sausage and flamin ' mash !
ssh ...
sorry , love .
sorry about that , pet .
it' s just that err ... my dad ran off with a room service maid .
things have never really been the same since .
bollocks .
now' s not a good time .
change of plan what do you mean ?
i want mcelroy kept alive .
i don' t do alive , i do dead .
it' s a matter of $20 million in cash being vaporised , and it' s a matter of a lot of anger being directed at the lizardman .
you now do alive .
my future is inside mcelroy' s skull
you waste anything and everybody that gets near him .
you waste them , not him .
his mind belongs to the lizard
shit .
fucking hell !
shit , shit , shit !
arsehole .
let go , you double crosser .
let go !
they' re mine !
oh !
oh , shit .
shit .

i got you out of that deal in one piece .
as far as i' m concerned , my job' s done .
it' s finished .
you can leave my motor alone , get your golf clubs , and fuck off back to dixie .

she dumped me .
two years ago now .
changed her name from dawn to dakota .
fucked off for las vegas and a deck of cards .
so who hired her to take me out ?
you' re asking the wrong question , mate .
she' s your guardian angel .
if she wanted you dead you' d be dead
she never misses .
i mean , fucking look at that .
if she really wanted to hit me ...
i' d be shitting through a tube for the rest of my life .

how the fuck did we end up in here ?
one little mistake ... 30 years ago .
all of these items are over the counter .
nothing illegal here .
you' re no fucking help , are you ?
i beg to differ .
you see , it' s not the ingredients themselves which determine the effect but the manner in which they' re combined .
these kids are getting very smart .
he' s right .
the ravers are the key .
aren' t you the clever little chunky monkey ?
you keep banging on about my weight .
you' re crossing a line .
arthur , it was a joke .
it was a joke .
smile .
smile .
you fat cunt .
yo , blowjob .
pos 51 .
comes in blue or race car red .
destination : stratosphere .
only , this one gets you there in 60 seconds .
you try one first .
thought you' d never ask .
pos 51 ?
you can' t call it that .
punters' il feel like right tits asking for tabs of 438 lou , whatever the number is .
no one' s going to know what they' re on about .
these scumbags spend their entire life smacked out of their heads .
numbers they couldn' t even tell you what fucking time it is .
all right , mr smug , what have you done ?
i think the shit' s about to hit the fan .
arrrrrgh !
phew .

special occasion , is it ?
are you going to be all right here on your own ?
mm hm .
she' s here .
right .
everything all right , lads ?
problems ?
no , man .
nothing we can' t handle .
every chemical used in the production of this drug is 100 % legal .
not one ingredient is found on any known government' s banned substance watch list .
hell , you can ship supertankers of this shit .
you can even lay a goddamn pipeline and no one would bat an eye .
pos 51 .
it' s all that .
and it can be yours .
if the price ... is right .
chemistry ...
mr mcelroy .
what is chemistry ... .. but the ability to attract adoration in others ?
you see , you' re like me , mr mcelroy .
you' re a sky highatrist , i' m a sky highatrist .
see i always knew i' d be a drug dealer even when i was a kid
i saw my dad hit my mother my mother hit my brother my brother hit my sister , and my sister fuck my father .
so it' s inevitable , really .
you' d have to be on drugs just to live in that madhouse , wouldn' t you ?
drugs are good , mr mcelroy .
drugs are our mates .
fuck .
i' m getting on my own nerves .
what i' m trying to say to you , mr mcelroy , is ... .. i' m very much attracted to what you have to offer .
how are you doing , felix ?
well , my boss is dead ... .. can' t get a ticket for tomorrow' s match , and , oh , yeah , i' ve got a fucking bullet hole in the arse .
apart from that ,
i' m tiptop .
so who' s the target ?
you' ve got that look in your eye .
i' ve been looking for you
oh , yeah ?
for old times ' sake or for the company i keep ?
little bit of both .
so , you have got me on your list , then ?
you' ve always been on my list .
40 years ago a rock and roll revolution was launched in this town .
tonight , we' re going to launch a new revolution .
one that will rock and roll your senses .
and you ... are my test pilots .
you' re going to kiss the sun and taste the motherfuckin ' rainbow .
are you ready ?
are ... you ... ready ?
then let' s get ready to party y y y .
have you any idea how much i missed you ?
why didn' t you stay with me , then ?
what , me ?
in america ?
don' t be soft !
besides , i don' t know who you are any more , girl .
it' s been nearly two years .
i haven' t heard a word .
still ...
i always hoped ...
.. you might ... change your mind ... .. and come home .
we could have a fresh start .
aren' t you going to say anything ?
this , mr mcelroy , is a fucking miracle .
drug use will reach epidemic proportions , revolutions will break out , governments will fall !
20 million , and not a penny less !
where do i sign ?
si ...
sign ? !
this ain' t some written contract .
the kind of agreement i could take you to court and sue your ass over .
you fuck me on this deal ,
i gotta take out a contract just to get even on the goddamn contract !
we think we have an agreement , we think we see things the same way .
either we do , or we don' t .
you' re either in , or you' re out .
you give me the money , i give you the formula .
are we clear ?
crystal , mr mcelroy .
crystal .
i' m not leo durant .
i' m a man of my word .
get in my way , and i' m gonna have to shoot you .

time to go , elmo .
mr kane .

i thought you weren' t due till next week , you eager beaver .

elevator music , a nigger in a kilt , and a chick with a nickel plated nine .
and now a word from our sponsor .
that ain' t no liverpool accent .
say hello , elmo .
hello , elmo .
absence makes the heart grow fronder elmo
and the lizard is so full of motherfucking fonderence for you that he got on this plane just to come see you .
i' m touched .
you will be .

you' re flush , sweetcakes .
you are flush .
he' s looking forward to seeing you .
so , what' s the price tag on my ass ?
it' s enough .
move .
last stop .
there' s nowhere from here but down .
reel me in !
why would i do a stupid thing like that ?
pull me up , will you ?
fold or call ?
what ?
you play poker .
fold or call ?
i' m your last chance , girl .
i' m that out you' ve been looking for .
i' m only gonna make this offer once .
you either take it and get out from under the lizard , or you stay a slave and wonder where your life went .
you think you can save me , do you ?
look where you are !
get real !
a million in bonds , untraceable .
that' s real !
that' s a fresh start .
try quitting while you' re ahead for a change ...

tell me something .
i' m intrigued .
is it true that you fellas are equipped with incredibly ... .. large ...
fuck !
thanks .
my pleasure .
you can move your arm now .
right then you scouse git in the hast 12 hours this city has gone from a peaceful fun loving utopia to an all out fucking war zone .
and i , virgil kane ...
well , i want to know why .
nobody cuts me out of anything in this parochial pisshole .
you smell that , felix .
smell it .
smell it !
that is essence of durant .
and durant got what he deserved .
so , when a deal goes down , you , my old sausage , will fix it .
time and place .
and then you will call me .
otherwise ...
accessory to murder .
possession of a firearm .
you fuck me ,
i' il have you on your hands and your knees , with your arse in the air , exposing your rusty sheriff' s badge for the next 20 years .
so ask yourself , are you going to help restore some national pride , and stick one on the yanks ?
or , like the rest of your life , are you going to piss it all away ?
are you going to help me to help you ?
eight hours till kickoff .
it' s a big game .
let' s just see if you come good .
mr kane .
see ya !
you' il never walk alone , eh , mate ?

i' m listening .
lizard offered dakota 250k to deliver my live ass to him .
i' ve made her a significantly better offer .
and i' m thinking ... she might entertain ... .. certain sentimental reasons for not doing her job .
the question is whether it' s going to pay me ... to be sentimental .
look , we have a choice .
we can use our " get out of jail free " cards , or we can choose " stop , do not pass go " .
do not collect 20 million dollars .
do we have a deal ?
do that again , i will definitely fucking shoot you .
shut your gob !
go and get yourself cleaned up !
and no shagging up there !

just to get out .

it' s bogus .
it' s what we chemists call a placebo .
it' s whatever you want it to be .
you can run all the tests you want , and it' il look like the best shit in the universe , but the ingredients ... they cancel each other out .
fucking confusing the lizard ain' t gonna fucking help your cause , elmo .
you' ve gotta give big ups to marketing .
the ability to make people believe .
the power of suggestion .
pos 51 .
i don' t give a shit !
