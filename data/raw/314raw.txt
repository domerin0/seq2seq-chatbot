this is henderson .
south side basement door' s open .
i' m gonna check it out .
ok , copy that .
whoa !
jeez , carlos .
thanks for the heart attack .
right back at ya .
had to swap out that septic pipe .
mmm .
well , on behalf of a grateful nation ...
henderson here .
mystery solved .
what happened ?
found a crazed plumber .
halt !
no !
don' t !
aaaah !
ok , um , professional opinion ?
uh ... sexy soccer mama or brainy beauty ?
you' re an aging sexpot celebrating a decade of turning 29 .
you got 2 little rugrats that aren' t that little , a husband who thinks the extras trailer is a buffet table , and gravity ain' t doing you any favors .
so " happy birthday , sexy mama " or ...
fred .
hey , fred , sweetie , you' re sorta like a woman .
oh , that' s ... not a compliment .
well , i mean , more so than el cid here .
i need some insight .
you' re an aging ...
i heard .
don' t send a card , don' t mention her birthday , send a big bunch of flowers just because she' s special and perfect and eternally blah di blah .
huh !
staring me right in the face .
genius .
and i' m a lot like a woman .
oh , you' re all woman .
you' re everywoman .
you' re wonder woman !
damn straight .
is that blood ?
yeah , but it' s ok .
it' s yours .
huh .
and how is that ok ?
demon law requires blood signatures on all legal documents .
your herbie hancock here locks and loads these docs .
then i take ' em into court and fire away .
locks and loads .
got it .
as c. e. o. and president of wolfram & hart , you just bankrupted a company that dumps raw demon waste into santa monica bay , banished a clan of pyro warlocks into a hell dimension , and started a foster care program for kids whose parents have been killed by vampires .
not bad for a day' s pay .
yeah .
great .
look , i know legal weasels and business deals aren' t as heroic to you as rescuing young honeys from tumescent trolls , but i love what we do .
tumescent ... trolls ?
went a little johnnie cochran on ya .
you know , for the first time in my life , i can' t wait to get to work in the morning .
you' ve always had your special powers .
now i have mine .
isn' t that special !
we all have special powers .
anybody wanna trade ?
i' il swap ya two for one .
walking through walls , picking up mugs ... in exchange for ...
i don' t know , how about me not being dead ?
how about you not being here ?
if wishes were horses ...
you ok ?
yeah .
fine .
like you said , not bad for a day' s pay .
i know you hate working here , what with the bureaucracy and the fact that most of our employees want us dead .
but in house attacks are down 30 % this week .
and we' ve done more good here in a month than angel investigations did in a year .
i know , i' m just ...
i don' t know , just feeling a bit ...
squishy ?
disconnected .
are you serious ?
here you are , finally living a piece of the high life ... new clothes , new cars , my old tumble fetching you tasty snacks ... and what' s your gripe ?
i feel disconnected .
you want to feel disconnected , try being a bloody ghost for a bit .
try bobbin ' around with no touch or taste or smell .
not many fates worse than that , i' d wager .
ok , maybe that .
i know what you' re saying about the disconnect .
much as i love the legalese , gotta admit , i miss mixing it up sometimes , you know ?
i miss getting my hands dirty .
then you' il be interested in this .
3 people found with their hearts cut out in east los angeles , all within the last couple of hours .
the police are on it , but my sense is it' s more demonic than some murderous nut job .
so we' re ruling out demonic nut jobs , then , are we ?
we should check it out .
right .
yo !
you missed one .
i' il get it .
wait !
wait .
hold up for a second .
i really hate this place .
the cautlonary of numero clnco  season 5 ep . 06
what happened ?
the mail guy threw me .
what ? !
number 5 ? !
he did this ?
isn' t he like 100 years old ?
kinda hard to tell with the mask .
angel was attacked .
lock it down .
no .
one of ours .
the mail guy , number 5 .
why did he attack you ?
i was trying to give him the mail ?
security' s on it .
we' il find him .
look , this is just a thing .
maybe i , you know , startled him or something .
i' m not taking any chances .
this is wolfram & hart .
you have enemies everywhere .
hey !
fred !
did ya hear ?
angel attacked the old mail guy .
what ? !
not number 5 ?
you didn' t hurt him ?
no .
i ...
he attacked me .
we should find him .
absolutely .
wanna buy him a pint .
bloody made my day .
gunn .
good .
great .
security found him .
they' re escorting him off the premises .
you do wanna fire his masked ass , don' t you ?
um , i don' t ...
i think it' s best .
look , really , i' m fine .
let' s just get back to the bod ...
holy tornado !
it' s true !
yeah .
it was amazing .
angel went right off on the mail guy .
oh , this must' ve been one major smackdown .
there was no smacking .
that' s not the hubbub i' m hearing , honeybuns .
word on the web has you sucker punching grandpa moses .
the web ?
don' t sweat it , sweetie pie .
i' ve got my flak catcher spinning this into p. r. gold .
once the word spreads you beat up an innocent old man , well , the truly terrible will think twice before going toe to toe with our avenging angel .
yes .
the geriatric community will be soiling their nappies when they hear you' re on the case .
bravo .
i didn' t beat anybody up , ok ?
so let' s just focus on what' s important , like wes ' bodies .
wesley has bodies ?
someone found 3 bodies .
4 .
another one was just found in a church after an all souls ' mass .
all souls ?
prayers for the departed .
you should know that , being departed and all .
tonight was a special service .
it' s the mexican day of the dead .
still not sure why blondie ghost tagged along .
not much choice really , is there ?
can' t drink , smoke , diddle my willy .
doesn' t leave much to do other than watch you blokes stumble around playing agatha christie .
yeah , remind me again how you ended up in the front seat .
called shotgun , mate .
oh .
i thought we were doing a weapons check .
nothin ' wrong with that .
we may need these bad boys if we' re going up against some mexican day of the dead heart suckin ' monster .
angel , the church we' re looking for is about half a mile ...
always was a bit of a drama queen .
too late .
so you what , heard his scream ?
he smelled the blood .
nothing grabs a vamp' s attention like the ruby red .
notice no matter how uptown we go , we always wind up in some stanky hole in the middle of the night ?
angel !
his heart' s missing .
looks like it was cut out with some sort of crude knife .
and based on these blood spatters ,
i' d say it was still beating when it was removed .
the blood' s fresh .
this just happened .
so whatever did this might still be close .
how close ?
i' d say 10 , 11 feet .
how you like that , sparky ?
ok , so next time , i hold onto the axe .
not that way , you git !
now focus .
bloody useless !
we shot it , chopped it , hacked and whacked it .
the only souvenir we got was the gunk on this blade .
thought you might do some tests .
sure .
maybe hematological ... cellular rh enzymes ... obviously a full sma 20 .
obviously .
give me a shout when you know something , ok ?
hmm .
demonoid entropy patterning couldn' t hurt .
if you' re trying to find out what this thing' s made of , it' s gonna take a while .
couldn' t care less . ' m just trying to put as much distance between myself and general grumpypants as my ghost leash allows .
he just gets like that sometimes .
not easy being a champion .
you know that .
really don' t .
come on .
you saved the world , sacrificed yourself , closed a hellmouth .
didn' t do much , really .
i just stood there ...
let the fire come .
nothin ' real heroic about that .
well , you did save my life .
well , when you say it like that ...
cross reference the weapons list against both aztec and incan artifacts .
sir .
uh , less reptilian , and the mouth was larger .
think predatory bird meets demonic gladiator .
xiochimayan codex .
how we doin ' ?
based on the creature' s appearance and weaponry ,
i' m focusing my team on prehispanic texts .
specifically mesoamerican .
good .
we' re not there yet , but i' m confident .
yeah , i can see that .
you' il find it .
then we' il figure out a way to stop it .
then ... then i' il ... stop it , ' cause that' s what we do .
i' il be in my office .
i wasn' t aware that you could read cuauhtitlan pictograms .
who , me ?
nah , i was just ... is this one of those books on prophecies ?
no , it' s a source book .
each one ties into a discipline within the wolfram & hart archives .
this one is linked to historical narratives .
that' s the one dedicated to prophecies .
so ... you could look up that , uh ... sans shoes thingamabob .
you know , the prophecy that says that angel gets to be a real boy again .
shanshu prophecy , yes .
uh , though it' s a bit more complicated than that .
complicated .
it tells of an epic , apocalyptic battle and a vampire with a soul who plays a major role in that battle .
and there' s the suggestion that the vampire will get to live again .
when you say , " plays a major role in an apocalyptic battle , " you mean like , um ... heroically closing a hellmouth that was about to destroy the world ?
the text isn' t specific about the battle .
but it' s specific about the name of the vampire with a soul .
no , i imagine it could be any vampire with a soul ...... who isn' t a ghost .
it' s a bunch of nonsense .
it' s a bedtime story to get vampires to play nice .
says you .
no , says angel .
yeah .
tall dark and dreary told me he doesn' t believe in that shanshu bugaboo .
says it' s a sucker' s game .
sir !
that' s it .
good .
print it out .
it' s an aztec demon named tezcatcatl .
we don' t know a lot about it yet .
our codex is missing several key pictographs .
what we do know is that it' s been here before ... 50 years ago to the day .
the day of the dead .
yes , though that may be a coincidence .
i' il know better once we determine why it' s here in l. a. or what it wants .
wolfram & hart has a brief record of what happened .
according to this , tezcatcatl rose in the same place ,
east los angeles , killed over a dozen people before it was finally defeated .
defeated ?
yes , by 5 heroes .
brothers .
they were the champions of that time .
they destroyed the demon ?
yes , but at quite a price .
the brothers were all killed .
all but one .
not to be captain obvious , but ... either the brothers didn' t really finish the demon off , or it' s figured out a way to come back from wherever they sent it .
either way , best of luck , mate .
you said one of the brothers survived .
is he still alive ?
yes .
ok then , i' il talk to him .
i' m sure he' il want to help .
do we have his number ?
as a matter of fact , we do .
hi .
unh !
stop doing that .
perhaps i wasn' t clear in our last conversation .
what conversation ?
you threw me through a window .
i heard you speaking .
you were going to drag me into your quest for the aztec demon .
no , i wasn' t .
i was gonna give you some mail .
oh .
sorry .
now i' m dragging you back in .
i need your help .
you and your brothers beat this aztec warrior thing first time around .
and i need to know how .
i' m sorry .
in case you haven' t noticed , i have retired from that life .
wearing that mask doesn' t exactly hide your past .
it reminds me that only a fool would want to be a champion .
fool ?
is that what you think of your brothers ?
never disrespect the memory of my brothers .
they were honorable men ... luchadores .
mexican wrestlers .
the greatest that ever lived .
together we were known as los hermanos numeros .
the number brothers ?
boy , you guys had no problem getting past the whole irony thing now , did you ?
it was a different time .
one that no longer exists .
we were great warriors in the ring , great heroes .
children worshipped us .
women loved us .
men wanted to be us .
in all the years we fought , we never lost .
never quit .
never compromised .
we were the best .
but not all of our battles were in the ring .
hermanos !
you need to understand .
we were more than just luchadores .
no one else cared about mexicans or chicanos , so we protected our own .
the five of us were always joined , always connected .
and when necessary , we came together as a fist .
we fought monsters and gangsters .
vampiros .
we were heroes .
we protected the weak ... and we helped the helpless .
i know a little something about that .
we spent every waking hour together .
we fought hard .
we played hard .
brothers in the truest sense .
never jealous , never bickering .
those were the happiest days of my life .
wait a second .
so you guys always wore your masks ?
what you are failing to see , my friend , is that we had to be ever vigilant , ready for action at a moment' s notice .
si .
si . ! hermanos !
surely you have heard about our great victory over the devil' s robot ?
sorry .
nobody remembers the good stuff .
but tell me about the aztec warrior .
what can i say about a demon who killed the people that mattered most to me ?
you can start by saying how you killed it back .
i don' t know .
can' t remember .
can' t remember or don' t care ?
do not misunderstand me .
after my brothers were killed , i tried to carry on ... ... tried to help people .
but after a while , the phone stopped ringing .
the people went away ... until one night when a man walked in .
he said his company could use a young man with my abilities .
wolfram & hart .
i needed a job .
they needed muscle .
i knew that wolfram & hart was everything my brothers despised .
but what did i care ?
nothing mattered after i buried them behind san gregorio .
every year on el dia de los muertos , i prepare this altar for them .
and every year , they never come , never visit .
because i am not worthy .
but it does not matter anymore .
not after this year .
i should have died with my brothers .
but you didn' t .
you got stuck with the hard part , the carrying on .
no wonder your brothers ' spirits never come to visit .
listen to yourself .
you' ve quit .
why' d you stop caring ?
it was not hard .
i will show you .
this is how my brothers are remembered , what their good deeds earned .
they sacrificed their lives as heroes , and it is played out as a farce .
maybe you expect too much from people .
is it too much to expect them to remember their past ?
to honor those that fought and died ?
my brothers are dead , and tezcatcatl is back to kill again .
why did we bother ?
what difference did we make ?
you made a difference in the lives you saved .
and you did it because ... it was the right thing to do .
nobody asks us to go out and fight , put our lives on the line .
we do it because we can , ' cause we know how .
we do it whether people remember us or not , in spite of the fact that there' s no shiny reward at the end of the day ... other than the work itself .
i think some part of you still knows that , still believes in being a hero .
i' d forgotten that aztec culture was so violent .
yeah , ' cause our culture' s so at peace .
all right , but by and large , we don' t eat our victims .
you got that file on the lady from the all soul' s mass ?
she' s the most puzzling .
the demon passed by over 20 people ... so he could attack her .
i know .
we need to find its m. o. , so angel can guess its next move .
does angel seem all right to you ?
yeah .
still adjusting to corporate life , i guess .
bit of a disconnect .
disconnect ?
his word , not mine .
but he' s still doing his hero thing .
wait a minute .
didn' t you say the homeless guy in the alley was a vet ?
yeah .
gulf war .
and something about a bronze star .
bronze star , lady in the church worked with gangs , this dude , a fireman .
saved his crew in a fire .
that' s the thread , that' s the m. o. ?
it' s taking the hearts of heroes .
so much for my stirring speech .
so you think this demon is eating the hearts of heroes , huh ?
well , it' s an interesting theory , and i can see where your research might seem to support that , but ... your theory kinda fell apart in the field .
angel , i know you' ve been through a horrible ordeal , and i' m not trying to ...
the reason why i know this aztec demon is not eating the hearts of heroes is ... he didn' t take mine .
am i honestly supposed to believe that it had no problem sticking a sword in my stomach but then decided , " oh , wait , his heart' s not heroic enough " ?
ha !
i don' t think so .
i understand you' re feeling rejected .
but this aztec warrior ... it wants the hearts for sustenance .
it wants it for the meat , not the metaphor .
what are you saying ?
as meat goes , your heart' s a dried up hunk of gnarly ass beef jerky .
yeah , well , stick a piece of wood in it , and i still die .
must mean something .
can we get back to figuring out how to kill this demon rather than figuring out why it didn' t kill you ?
ok , before ol ' numero cinco bolted on the bus , did he drop any details about how he and his brothers defeated this aztec thing ?
wes , did you ever hear that the devil built a robot ?
el diablo robotico .
why ?
nobody ever tells me anything .
i' m gonna go check with my guys in contracts .
gunn , this should take precedence .
relax .
it' s warrior related .
i got to thinking , if this aztec demon got back to come back after 50 years , maybe it made some kind of supernatural deal with something .
and if there' s a deal , might be a contract .
angel , what gunn said about your heart ... the dried up bit ...
i don' t think that' s the problem .
but you do see a problem ?
it' s the work .
oh , yeah .
the 18 hour days , the constant slaying of evil , and the being shish kebabed to a chevy .
i didn' t say you weren' t working .
i' m just saying your heart' s not in the work .
well , yeah , you know , i' ve been feeling a little bit , uh ...
disconnected .
yes , i' ve heard .
but i think it' s more serious than that .
you blame your melancholy on your new position , but i don' t think it' s about the type of work .
i think it' s because you' ve lost hope that the work has meaning .
of course it has meaning .
we save people' s lives .
i' m not talking about them .
i' m talking about you .
it' s lost meaning for you .
spike says you no longer believe in the shanshu prophecy .
of course not .
the prophecies are nonsense .
you know that .
oh , come on , wes , after everything we' ve seen the past couple of years ?
the father will kill the son .
what are you talking about ?
look , we' re getting the work done .
as long as i keep doing what i do , doesn' t matter if
i believe in the shanshu or any other prophecy .
i' m sorry , angel , but nothing matters more .
it' s the only thing that will sustain you , that will keep you from ending up like number 5 .
yeah .
it' s fred .
she' s got something .
so it' s eating the hearts of heroes , and their blood is what keeps it alive .
yeah , but it does more than that .
it acts like a kind of supercharged rocket fuel .
makes it , you know ...
nigh invulnerable .
oh , i could kill it .
i mean , ghostiness to the contrary .
well , come on , lads .
everything has an achilles heel .
and you just so happen to know this creature' s achilles heel ?
well , i wager it' s the heart .
you see that in the science ?
no , luv , in the poetry .
we' re dealing with a mythic creature here , a kill or be killed kind of creature .
if i was gonna kill something that was trying to take my heart ,
i' d try to bloody well take its heart first .
and you' d be doing the right thing .
that' d stop it for the time being .
time being ?
yeah .
he' s kinda got a get out of jail free card .
it' s in his contract .
contract ?
figure of speech .
curse , hex , any shady supernatural deal ...
wolfram & hart has a record of it .
tezcatcatl was one of the aztecs ' most powerful warriors .
he forged a mystical talisman that would harness the power of their sun god , make him supernova powerful .
but he got found out , was sentenced to die on the aztec version of day of the dead .
so he made a mystical deal .
yeah , it was pretty clever , really .
he had their shaman put a curse on him to return from the dead every 50 years .
been doing it for centuries .
usually , that' d be a bad thing , but , in his case , it brings him back so he can keep searching for the talisman .
any idea what happened to the talisman ?
it was given to a great hero in charge of protecting it .
which gets passed down through the generations so each time this demon returns , it' s searching for that talisman .
and if it finds it , the demon becomes sun god powerful , and you sods become a series of hearty snacks .
is there a drawing of it ?
negative .
all i know is that it' s gold , about the size of a quarter , and has the sun and some other spooky mumbo jumbo carved into it .
oh , see !
drama queen .
tezcatcatl ... ven .
yo te espero .
come .
i wait for you .
won' t work , you know .
you want the aztec warrior to come , to kill you so you can be with your brothers , but ... he won' t .
he will be here .
i summoned him .
maybe .
but he won' t kill you ... or me .
missing the secret ingredient .
now give me the talisman , and i' il leave you to your misery .
i don' t have it .
where is it ?
you are one strange man , seor angel .
i' m not the one in a mask standing in a cemetery in the middle of the night .
no .
but you will be .
you want this thing to punch your ticket , fine .
but i' m not gonna let it get the talisman .
say you stop it .
then what ?
in 50 years it' s back , and nothing has changed .
give it to me .
you were right about tezcatcatl not wanting to kill me , that i am not a hero , so i had to find a way to fool him , to make myself worthy .
i swallowed the talisman .
if he wants it , he will have to cut it out of me .
you want your talisman ?
pues , ven y tomalo .
esta en mi panza .
don' t you remember ?
i' m the hombre who destroyed you last time .
come on .
it' s in here .
come and get it .
that' s it .
again .
not gonna make it that easy for you .
we already did this little dance , remember ?
if you' re looking for heroes , you' re wasting your time .
no !
it' s time i taught you something .
mis hermanos .
! andale !
amigo ... andale .
we' re trying to kill it , not pin it .
ok .
pinning works .
mis hermanos , they came back .
because you' re worthy .
you proved it .
maybe .
but still the demon did not want my heart .
he didn' t want mine , either .
of course not , amigo .
who would want that dried up walnut of a dead thing ?
... c coffee ...
coffee ?
you want coffee ? ! estupido !
the talisman .
it' s in ...
i may not be a hero , but i am not a fool .
see if you can put this someplace safe .
angel , are you ok ?
i know you' ve been feeling ...
i' m fine .
got the job done .
that' s what' s important .
it' s been a long day .
see you guys in the morning .
so number 5 , he jumped in and helped at the end ?
he died a hero .
shansu prophecy , english translation .
