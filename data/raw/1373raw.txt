the ship' s unique design ...
there were no fatalities ...

oh , come on !
you gotta admit , this is cool .
just like a movie !
the robot will emerge dramatically , do some damage .
throngs of screaming people !
and just when all hope is lost , syndrome will save the day !
i' il be a bigger hero than you ever were !
you mean you killed off real heroes so that you could pretend to be one ?
oh , i' m real .
real enough to defeat you !
and i did it without your precious gifts , your oh so special powers .
i' il give them heroics .
i' il give them the most spectacular heroics anyone' s ever seen !
and when i' m old and i' ve had my fun , i' il sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes .
everyone can be super .
and when everyone' s super ... ... no one will be .
fire at will !
it' s overwhelming the tanks .
i' m sorry .
this is my fault .
i' ve been a lousy father .
blind to what i have .
so obsessed with being undervalued
that i undervalued all of you .
dad ?
shh .
don' t interrupt .
so caught up in the past that i ...
you are my greatest adventure .
and i almost missed it .
i swear , i' m gonna get us out of this safely if i ...
well , i think dad has made some excellent progress today but i think it' s time we wind down now .
we need to get back to the mainland .
i saw an aircraft hangar on my way in .
straight ahead .
where are all the guards ?
go , go !
hey , every time they run , you take a shot .
this is the right hangar , but i don' t see any jets .
a jet' s not fast enough .
what' s faster than a jet ?
how about a rocket ?
great !
i can' t fly a rocket .
you don' t have to .
use the coordinates from the last launch .
