# i know i am , i' m sure i am i' m west ham till i die # [ shouting ]
go on , bruv .
go on , bruv .
fuck me .
if i knew we was going to a bar mitzvah , i' d have brought me fucking skullcap .
mate , tottenham' s due north .
are you lost or just fucking stupid ?
still a stand up comedian , eh , dunham ?
all right , mate .
when the major was doing your job , he wasn' t nearly so chatty .
probably ' cause he wasn' t quite so nervous either .
the major always preferred a scrap to your yammer .
what' s all that ?
what is that ?
yammer ?
you reckon ?
mate , i think you should get on the next train and fuck off out of here .
before something bad happens .
we' d be interested to see exactly what that is .
you' re not exactly top flight mob these days , are you ?
more like a two bob mob .
see , now , that' s just plain rude .
but if you fancy it , who are we to let you down ?
come on , then !
come on , then , you fucking poncey cunt !
you fucking cunt !
you !
fucking have it !
come on .
let' s go .
i' m telling you , you don' t need lewis .
i will trade you keeshon and maddux for lewis .
and i' m gonna be losing out on this deal .
because keeshon , he' s back with the old coach .
he' s back with parcells .
and they are gonna be an unstoppable team .
you know that .
i know that .
look , man , he was comeback player of the year , you know .
not many guys have thrown over 6, 000 yards .
come on .
let me call you back .
i gotta deal with something .
buckner .
that $10, 000 .
i think it' s a pretty good deal .
we never had a deal , jeremy .
look , i know you got screwed here .
but i have my family' s reputation to protect .
a van holden getting expelled from harvard .
no way .
i' ve got a little more at stake here , matt .
buckner .
come on , man .
my dad is definitely gonna get re elected .
when i graduate , i' il totally hook you up .
thanks , bro .
you' re really saving my ass .
you' ve reached carl buckner .
i' m currently on assignment in kabul and i' m unreachable .
leave a message at the foreign correspondents desk at the washington bureau of the times and we' il get back to you as soon as possible .
thanks so much .
this is a security announcement at heathrow airport .
please keep your belongings with you at all times .
my name is matt buckner .
last spring , i got kicked out of harvard two months shy of my diploma , but what i was about to learn , no lvy league school in the world could teach me .
mind the gap .
please stand clear of the closing doors .
mind the gap .
please stand clear .
matt !
hi .
hey .
hey .
oh , my god .
it' s so good to see you .
you , too .
was that a terrorist attack ?
what happened here ?
welcome to match day madness .
tottenham was in town last night .
are you a soccer fan now ?
don' t let them hear you say soccer .
who' s " them " ?
the british empire .
uncle matt , meet ben .
can you believe that ?
hey there , little guy .
he' s adorable .
yeah .
it is so good to see you .
but what are you doing here ?
it doesn' t make sense .
why would you have been expelled if you didn' t do anything wrong ?
it was my roommate .
he' s a total cokehead .
somebody tipped off campus security and we got our room searched .
they found his stash in my stuff .
i guess he' d been hiding his shit in my closet the entire time .
really ?
yeah , really .
you could tell me if you were taking ...
it' s not like that .
so you fought it and they didn' t believe you ?
matt .
you fought it , right ?
look , you don' t know who this guy is .
he' s a van holden .
i wouldn' t have even had a chance .
so what did dad say ?
you' ve reached carl buckner .
i' il be in the lvory coast for 57 years " ?
kabul this time .
whatever .
seriously , though , when you spoke to him , what did he say ?
i didn' t tell him .
he doesn' t know ?
i probably would have done the same thing .
yeah ?
once he finds out his golden boy got kicked out of harvard , he' il dive headfirst into an empty swimming pool .
gee , thanks .
oh , steve' s home .
hi , baby .
hey .
i' ve got a surprise for you .
oh , honey , we have a guest .
this is my kid brother , matt .
matt .
all right , mate ?
how are you doing ?
it' s good to finally meet you .
and you .
finally made it across the pond ?
yeah .
who' s this ?
who' s this ?
come here .
oh , i missed you .
come here .
oh !
i missed you , little lord ben .
honey , you want some tea ?
yeah , that' d be great .
tea , huh ?
get over it .
he' s a good looking little geezer , in' t he ?
sure is .
listen , matt .
i' m really pleased you' re here , but i made some plans for tonight .
i' ve got this whole romantic evening set up .
i' ve got the babysitter booked , and we' ve got tickets to see chicago .
you wouldn' t mind if we go ?
oh , excuse me .
shall we go and see who' s banging the door down ?
what a surprise .
what are you doing ?
aye aye !
all right , bruv .
jesus , shannon , you look rough .
you' re a funny guy , pete .
matt , this is pete , steve' s brother .
pete , this is my brother , matt .
hi .
all right , son ?
good to meet you .
hello , ben .
# i' m west ham till i die i' m west ham till i die
# i know i am , i' m sure i am ... # all right .
i' m taking him to bed .
all right , babe .
see you later , ben .
well done .
i thought you were going to the match .
well , technically , yes .
but we got into a bit of a drinking session last night .
one thing led to another ...
you' ve lost your wallet .
and me keys .
there' s a taxi outside .
top bloke , my brother .
so ...
how are we , my colonial cousin ?
fine , thanks .
fine , thanks .
you couldn' t make it a hundred ?
how does piss off sound ?
fuck off , come on .
# get some drinks in get some drinks in
# get ... # shut up .
just shut up .
i' il tell you what i' il do , all right ?
i' il give you a hundred ... ... if you take matt here to the match .
fuck off , you' re having a bubble .
i can' t take a yank to football .
yeah , you can .
and you' re gonna be on your best behaviour , do you understand ?
go on .
well , come on , then .
cheers , matt .
we don' t get much time on our own .
right , listen to me .
you don' t give him the money , ok ?
no way .
that' s beer for the boys .
all right .
all right ?
matt ?
where are you going ?
i' m going to the soccer game with pete .
but you just got here .
i know , but i' il catch up with you later .
have a good time .
see you .
hurry up .
i don' t want him hanging out with pete and those thugs .
it' s all right .
he' s a big boy .
he can look after himself .
pick a hand .
come on .
the right hand ?
you' ve just won the star prize .
yeah ?
how much do you love me ?
a lot .
that' s not enough .
i' m not being funny , but the last thing i want to do is to take you to the match .
so here' s how it works .
give me half the money .
i' il go to football .
you can see where churchill took a tom , or whatever you yanks do in jolly old .
tom ?
tom .
a tomtit , shit .
it' s rhyming slang .
like bees and honey for money .
like i could say to you , give me the fucking bees .
i made a promise to steve .
well , steve ain' t here , is he , mate ?
i am .
you' re pissing in the wind if you think i' m taking you .
i' m not giving you the money .
you ain' t really got a fucking choice , mate .
and you' re starting to get on my tits .
give me half the money .
cops !
well , how fucking stupid do you feel now ?
come on , then , dance for me , yankee .
serves you right for fighting like a bleeding tart .
but try that again and i will kick the shit out of you .
yeah , the tom out of me .
i get it .
get up .
come on .
so , i' m guessing you' re not much of a fighter .
fighter ?
that' s probably the first fight i ever had .
you call that a fight ?
fuck it .
i will take you with me .
you might learn something .
about soccer ?
no , mate .
not about soccer .
and for fuck' s sake , stop saying soccer .
come on , hurry up .
what are you talking about , baseball is a girls ' game ?
the red sox guy pitches a ball at 90 miles an hour .
who cares ?
all that means is he can have a wank faster than you .
come on .
think about it .
i just don' t get it .
what is it with you americans ?
you start a fucking war , bottle it , then we have to come save your arse again .
save our ass ?
yes .
on top of that , you kill half our soldiers in friendly fire .
that' s called an accident .
yeah , accident my arse .
all right ?
all right , dunham ?
look , we' re sort of going into my place of business , right ?
shut up and you might have a better run of things .
only thing regarded worse than a yank around here are coppers and journalists .
what have you got against journalists ?
how long have you got ?
they' re lying fucking scum who' il write anything just to fill papers .
not your old man , of course .
he' s the exception maybe .
these boys don' t know about your old man .
if i was you , i' d keep it that way .
another thing .
what you hear in here stays in here , all right ?
no blabbing to brother steve about who said what .
what happens at football stays at football .
all right ?
yeah , all right .
let' s have some fun .
it' s football day !
all right , pete .
aye aye !
how' s it going ?
good , yeah , good .
all right , boys ?
this is matt , shannon' s brother .
ned .
nice to meet you .
dave .
swill .
hello , mate .
ike .
and the one with the dodgy haircut' s keith .
hey , keith .
i' il get the drinks in , then .
does that mean i' m getting the drinks in ?
every fucking time .
every fucking time .
where' s bovver ?
he' s been in the toilet for 15 minutes .
dodgy ruby or something .
look , he looks lost .
ruby murray means curry .
we call it cockney rhyming slang .
slang .
yeah , like bees and honey for money .
struggle and grunt for cunt !
why' d you go there ?
like septic tank for yank .
bovver .
bov .
how you doing ?
all right ?
this is matt , shannon' s brother .
hey .
that' s the proper ...
he don' t give a fuck .
he don' t give a fuck .
mate , he' s practically family .
ah , mate , it' s fucking painful .
bov' s a miserable cunt , but we love him dearly , don' t we ?
sometimes .
like a fucking brother .
grab these last two pints .
get some salted peanuts .
sure .
bov , come on .
he' s all right , man .
what' s with all the fucking babysitting ?
you know we had a meet set up for today .
i' il stay out the way .
it' s not like we didn' t have it last night .
what ?
that' s not the bloody point , is it ?
we look like right mugs if our fearless leader don' t show
' cause he' s playing pin the tail on the fucking yank .
he' s right .
he' s got a point .
you let me worry about that , all right , boys ?
as for the yank , he' s too modest to tell you , but back in the states he' s an internationally ranked double black belt in karate .
is he fuck !
look at the size of him .
no .
bloody karate kid film ?
based on his exploits .
really ?
yeah , it' s true .
bollocks !
bollocks !
come on , why not ?
you' ve been here fucking five minutes and you' re lying .

you owe it all to him .
i can' t remember it .
miyagi !

miyagi .
miyagi .
mr miyagi .
he was based on a real person .
they based him on a real person .
that' s out of order .
did they pay him ?
of course he got fucking paid .
just imagine the situation .
no , listen , seriously .
imagine the situation .
someone uses you in a fucking film ...
it' s a liberty .
don' t take the piss out of me .
this is real stuff i' m talking about .
to the real mr miyagi !

any trouble , just walk the other way .
don' t worry .
let' s go , eh ?

look , i don' t want any trouble !
a fucking yank .
why' s a yank running with the gse ?
i don' t know anything about the gse .
i' m just a tourist .
how about we leave you with a souvenir ?
ever heard of a chelsea grin , huh ?
come on , please !
do you take american express ?
i bet the major gave out his share of chelsea grins , back when the gse weren' t so sloppy to leave one of their own behind .
we don' t leave our mates behind .
you horrible bastard .
look , he' s getting away !
let' s go !
down this side .
i' il get the van .
where the fuck' s he gone ?
where the fuck is he ?
i' m getting too old for this shit .
seriously , i could use a beer and a lie down .
oh , here he is .
get it out of first .
can' t get it out your mum .
she has to be financed .
come on , back to the abbey .
whose round is it ?
whose round do you think it is ?
it' s not my round .
oh , shut up moaning .
it stinks .
fuck off !
come on , boys .
let' s fucking have him !
let' s have the little cunt !
zulu !
zulu !
zulu !
zulu !
zulu !
what the fuck' s that ?
well , come on , then !
what you fucking standing there for , you cunts ?
oh , here we go .
let' s get out of here !
what ?
there' s 20 guys !
you don' t run when you' re with us .
you stand your ground and fight .
i don' t know how .
just think of someone you hate .
come on , then !
get up , you fucking twat !
come on !
ah , you fucking ...
get off !
come on !
come on !
come on !
come on !
fuck me !
what do you make of that , then ?
what a fucking result !
you were a fucking maniac , matt .
fair play , son .
there' s plenty who would' ve bottled it and done a runner .
good for you .
i' m proud of you .
who was he , then ?
who ?
the geezer you was just fighting .
jeremy van fucking holden .
you done yourself proud , mate .
now we' ve all stopped kissing each other' s arses , see the first punch he threw ?
on the feminine side .
a bit gay .
little bit larry grayson .
come on .
come on , yous all wanna get pinched ?
let' s push him out .
morning , sunshine .
how do you feel ?
oh , a little sore .
english breakfast , double dose of aspirin , you' il feel sweet as a nut , mate .
yeah .
i gotta piss like a racehorse .
fucking journos .
look at this .
west ham wins three nil in a blinding performance and our little scrap makes the headline .
bloody muckrakers .
so , what is this ?
bollocks journo bullshit .
no , no , this .
the gse .
shh !
lower it , son .
are you guys like an organised political movement or something ?
no , mate .
we' re a firm .
you never heard of a firm in the states ?
no .
every football team in europe' s got a firm .
some have two .
christ , i forgot how clueless you yanks are .
all you' ve seen of us are the stadium riots on tv .
come on .
two bacon sarnies .
see , west ham football' s mediocre , but our firm is top notch and everyone knows it .
the gse .
green street elite .
great football , shit firm .
the gooners .
shit football and a shit firm .
the yids , they' re called .
i put their main lad through a phone box window .
what about millwall ?
ah , millwall .
where to even fucking begin with millwall ?
millwall and west ham firms hate each other more than any other firms .
sort of like the yankees and the red sox .
more like the israelis and the palestinians .
we haven' t played millwall in ten years .
their top boy' s this geezer named tommy hatcher .
horrible old cunt .
back in the major' s day , tommy' s son was killed in a scrap .
after that , he went completely mental , lost the plot .
who' s the major ?
ah , the major .
quite a legend round here .
he ran the gse in the ' 90s when i was coming up .
hardest bastard you ever saw .
they say we kind of lost our way when he left .
but believe me , my boys are bringing the old gse reputation right back .
so , basically , firms are gangs .
kind of .
but we' re a far cry from all that bloods and crips bullshit .
shooting a machine gun out of a moving car at an eight year old girl , that' s just cowardly .
see , we might be into fighting and all that , but it' s really about reputation .
humiliating another mob in a row or doing something the other firms get to hear or talk about .
like a yank in his first fight battering one of birmingham' s main lads .
here you are , love , sit down .
thank you .
i don' t know how to thank you for what you did .
don' t give it another thought .
yesterday was a good result for us .
we had a laugh , a few pints , cheered on the mighty hammers .
we was completely outnumbered , but we stuck by our mates and we stood our ground , no matter what .
that' s what it' s all about .
looking at the fucking state of him .
don' t fucking start , all right ?
what did i say to you ?
no trouble .
it had nothing to do with me .
he' s walking home , he gets jumped .
he' s lucky we was there .
you' re a real hero , ain' t you , mate ?
and you saw the whole thing from your sofa ?
concentrate on your family and leave my business to me .
my family ?
what is it with you , eh ?
do you want mum to visit you in the nick ?
maybe you want the plot next to dad .
oh , my god !
matt , what happened ?
shannon , i' m fine .
pete , can' t you see what you' re doing to this family ?
all i see is a scared old man .
don' t talk to me like that !
you got the wrong idea .
get your fucking hands off me !
stop it !
steve !
stop it !
get the fuck out !
get out !
fuck !
shit .
babe , i' m so sorry .
well , that weren' t the smartest of moves , mate .
but thanks , yeah ?
fancy a pint ?
no .
oh , come on .
you' re the one that' s got to buy the bleeding thing .
get your cash out .
the fat bird' s about to sing .
ah , shot .
jesus !
you two joined at the fucking hip or what ?
leave it out , bov .
it' s getting old .
no , i' m starting to wonder about you two .
if i didn' t know any better , i' d say you was a couple of gay boys .
bov , we' ve known each other a long time , yeah ?
i trust you more than any other bloke i know .
but you' re getting dangerously close to crossing the line with me .
if you' ve got a problem , then it' s your fucking problem , not mine .
but if you want to discuss it further , we can go outside .
beers , boys .
hey , bov .
it' s your shot , mate .
come on .
let' s crack on with the game .
pete .
everything all right , mate ?
i can' t believe you came all this way and didn' t even stay the night .
i don' t want to mess anything else up .
you didn' t mess anything up .
so you and steve are ok ?
yeah .
yeah , we' re fine .
all right , well , i' il call you from pete' s .
matt .
please don' t go .
steve feels so horrible about what happened and he really wants you to stay with us , and so do i.
i don' t want you to stay with pete .
well , i wanna stay with pete .
pete and his thug friends aren' t the answer .
what are you talking about ?
what answer ?
i' ve been begging you to come and visit me for the last three years and you didn' t even come to my wedding and ...
you don' t know my husband , haven' t held your nephew , and you show up on my doorstep yesterday and you' re leaving already .
look who' s talking .
you ran to another fucking country after mom died .
i' m sorry .
you come and visit me .
yeah , of course .
jeremy van holden ?
sounds like a cunt .
mate , if he' d done that to me , i' d smash seven shades of shit out of him .
sounds like these harvard boys would slit your throat in your sleep .
what was you studying , before this geezer stitched you up ?
history .
history ?
i teach history .
you teach ?
yes , cheeky slag .
history and pe .
what , did you think the gse paid a bloody wage ?
i' m smart as fuck .
come on , it' s brass monkeys out here .
class , today we have an extraordinarily distinguished guest .
mr buckner is an american who went to the finest university in the united states , harvard .
but despite his prestigious education ,
mr buckner still thinks that baseball is better than football .
i know , boys .
it' s an utter sin .
it' s our job to save this heathen from his evil ways and teach him what really matters in life , and that is ?
football !
exactly .
we' re going to play five a side .
mr buckner will be goalie for the away colours .
now , go easy on him , boys .
you know how these americans bruise .
how do we keep this fair ?
i let every other ball go through ?
i wouldn' t worry about that .
all right .
you ready ?
go on , son .
that' s it !
that' s it !
ah , beautiful !
beautiful !
relax , kids .
go on , duncan .
go on , duncan , have it .
take it all the way .

oh , beautiful goal !
all right , that' s it .
what was that ?
go on , my son .
beautiful .
sheer beauty .
lovely .
all right .
10 .
3 .
thanks to some pathetic goalkeeping from the away keeper .
all right , get yourselves changed , boys .
played .
that' s what i call a real ass whipping .
you set me up .
that was like the junior olympic football team , right ?
no , mate .
just regular english boys .
we' ve got history next .
say a few words about the american war of independence .
they' d get a kick out of a real live colonial .
american history isn' t really my specialty .
mate , they' re ten .
teach them whatever you want .
well , i sort of have plans with shannon this afternoon .
we' il have a beer later .
yeah , see you at the pub .
all right , mate .
who are you ?

but these kids ...
he set me up , man .
i' m thinking this is some class of kids , little ones .

fat cunt .
fucking fat bastard .
hello , mate .
get the fucking chips in .
well , i' il be fucked .
if it ain' t my old mate bovver .
how are you doing , son , all right ?
i' il say one thing , you got some fucking front showing your face over this side of the water .
there' s plenty of people round here love to kick your fucking arse , given half the chance .
there' s four of ' em stood over there .
fucking right , son .
so , bov , what' s all this i' m hearing about your firm gone all fucking international , eh ?
don' t you even fucking think about ignoring me , you little cunt .
now , i said what' s all this bollocks i' m hearing about you having a little yank on the firm ?
it' s only temporary .
temporary , eh ?
do you think i can get a bit of quiet here ?
i' m trying to have a fucking conversation !
what' s his problem ?
shh .
