i want to say good bye .
bye , y' all .
excuse me .
thank you all for coming .
i' m donald sinclair .
i own this hotel .
we don' t have much time .
there' s a meteor the size of north carolina heading straight for earth .
the impact is going to kill every thing and everyone on this planet .
i built a bunker in the basement strong enough to withstand the blast .
there' s room for eight people .
i have chosen the seven of you , plus me .
when this is over , we will repopulate and re civilize the planet .
i couldn' t resist !
i' m sorry .
a joke .
he made a joke .
do sit down , please .
merrill , you and your mother can sit over here .
how do you know she' s my mother ?
alas , there are no secrets anymore .
actually , that' s not quite true .
there is one secret , one last secret .
it involves all of you .
i' m getting goose pimples .
hey
ah , mr. schaffer !
curiosity got the better of you , eh ?
come and sit down .
i' m fine .
thanks .
you haven' t missed anything .
we were just cutting to the chase .
cutting to the chase .
well , you' il laugh later .
now , as you know , the odds against winning a jackpot downstairs ... or hitting the state lottery are astronomical millions to one .
a serious person doesn' t even bother , but today ... you have the chance of playing a game ... where the odds of winning are one in six .
one in six .
it' s one throw ... of the dice .
this is my attorney , mr. grisham ... who tragically was born without a personality .
mr. grisham insists anyone who wishes to participate in our experiment ... sign this waiver , absolving the casino from responsibility or damages ... personal liability , blah , blah , blah .
so , who do you like , claude ?
the young woman in the black coat .
she looks desperate .
yes , but she has her mother with her .
that could slow her down , hmm ?
perhaps .
now , 563 miles from here ... is a little town called silver city , new mexico .
gold rush .
quite right , nick .
yes , they struck gold there in 1860 .
it was the second largest gold rush in american history .
very good , nick .
i think nick should be our captain .
in downtown silver city , there' s a train station .
as you go in the front door , there' s some lockers on the right .
mr. grisham , do you have the keys ?
six identical keys .
they all open the same locker .
that' s locker 001 .
inside the locker is a red duffel bag .
inside the red duffel bag ... is $2 million .
in cash , fifties and hundreds , makes a pile about so big .
first one there keeps it all .
i put transmitting devices in your key rings to keep track of you .
and that' s it .
go .
you just can' t pick people at random .
i can do anything i like , owen .
i' m eccentric .
go !
wait , wait .
so , it' s like a race ?
a race .
it' s a race .
i hope i win .
what are the rules ?
there' s only one rule .
are you ready ?
here it is .
there are no rules .
go .
go !
so now when you say , " go , " you mean just go ?
begin , commence , start moving .
theoretically , you have been racing for about 40 seconds .
so far , mr. schaffer is winning ... because he' s nearest to the door .
you' re crazy !
a race !
a race !
you have to pace yourself .
carbohydrate is important .
pasta is good .
breathing is important .
scusi .
one
it' s some sort of joke .
it has to be .
what kind of jackass just gives away $2 million ?
maybe it' s a publicity stunt .
what kind of publicity ?
he swore us all to secrecy .
maybe it' s a secret publicity stunt .
a secret publicity stunt ?
yes !
i don' t know what his angle is , but there' s always an angle .
donald sinclair people like him make millions of dollars ... playing people like us for chumps .
i' m nobody' s chump .
so you don' t believe 11 : 30 , nonstop to chicago .
i' m gonna be on it .
you know what ?
he' s right .
i' m not cuttin ' short my first family vacation ... in three years to go on some half assed wild goose chase .
okay , so , you' re not goin ' for it ?
i don' t think so .
not me , no .
no .
great .
i guess that' s that , huh ?
right .
it was nice meetin ' y' all .
i' m gonna take the stairs .
my room' s just two floors down , so nice meetin ' ya .
hey , have a nice vacation .
you know , it' s probably stuck .
i think i' m gonna take the stairs too .
crap .
go , go , go , go !
come on , vera !
watch out !
comin ' through !
hold the door , please .
take your time .
no rush .
get up !
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait !
if we' re all gonna go for it , why don' t we go for it together ?
you know , split the money 50 50 .
fifty fifty ?
you know what i mean .
whatever .
yes , yes , that' s a good plan .
it' s a race .
it' s a race .
i' m winning .
i' m winning .
and they' re off !
no one no one is offering you action like this .
a horse race with animals that can think and plan ... and lie and cheat and play dirty .
it' s the gambling experience of a lifetime .
it' s my way of saying i understand men like you .
i know what you want .
i know what you need .

ladies and gentlemen , members of the press
what' s going on ?
some rocket scientists from l. a .... they' re trying to break the land speed record .
a unique combination of automotive and aerodynamic innovation .
the vehicle , which we call lightning ll ... represents three years of r & d ... which was conducted at the california institute of technology .
the design team was led by professor ken freedman and dr. richard kramer .
we believe that , aerodynamically ... this is the most perfect vehicle ever designed .
the entire vehicle weighs less than 1, 850 pounds .
the body is a one piece kevlar composite .
the wheels are solid billet aluminum ... and she' s powered by twin je 79 turbojet engines ... the same engines that are in the f 4 phantom jet .
are there any questions ?
mr. calvert , what is the current land speed record ?
that would be 742 miles per hour ... but we hope to have a new record today .
anyone else ?
how do you start it ?
good question .
a green lever to the left of the steering wheel in the cockpit ... engages the primary thruster , igniting the je
740 , 745
that' s a record .
they' il break the sound barrier .
well , that' s it .
i still don' t think she' s gonna hold .
what do we owe you ?
five hundred bucks .
what ?
for two quarts of sealant ?
no way .
that' s 20 bucks tops .
okay , here' s 40 dollars .
that' s double what it' s worth , okay ?
come on , nick .
let' s go .
hold it .
another little tool no mechanic should be without .

here' s your $500 .
but you know what , billy ray ?

somebody once told me
the world is gonna roll me
i ain' t the sharpest toolin the shed
and she was lookin ' kind of dumb
with a finger and a thumb
in the shape of an " l " on her forehead
well , the years start comin ' and they don' t stop comin '
fed to the rules and i hit the ground runnin '
didn' t make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
so much to do , so much to see
so what' s wrong with takin ' the backstreets
you' il never know if you don' t go
you' il never shine if you don' t glow
hey , now , you' re an all star
get your game on , go play
hey , now , you' re a rock star get the show on , get paid
all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
it' s a cool place and they say it gets colder
you' re bundled up now wait till you get older
but the meteor men beg to differ
judgin ' by the hole in the satellite picture
the ice we skate is gettin ' pretty thin
the water' s gettin ' warm so you might as well swim
my world' s on fire how about yours
that' s the way i like it and i' il never get bored
hey , now , you' re an all star get your game on , go play
hey , now , you' re a rock star get the show on , get paid
all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
go to the moon
go to the moon
go to the moon
oh , yeah , go to the moon
hey , now , you' re an all star get your game on , go play
hey , now , you' re a rock star get the show on , get paid
all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars
somebody once asked could i spare some change for gas
i need to get myself away from this place
i said yep , what a concept
i could use a little fuel myself
and we all could use a little change
well , the years start comin ' and they don' t stop comin '
fed to the rules and i hit the ground runnin '
didn' t make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
so much to do so much to see
so what' s wrong with takin ' the backstreets
you' il never know if you don' t go
you' il never shine if you don' t glow
hey , now , you' re an all star get your game on , go play
hey , now , you' re a rock star get the show on , get paid
all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
