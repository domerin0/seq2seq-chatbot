this must end !
i agree .
then get started .
we didn' t wait for you to go after pp .
and the result ...
what ?
pp le moko is still at large .
algiers isn' t pigalle .
in pigalle , he' d have been behind bars long ago .
you' il think otherwise when you understand the situation .
our people in paris don' t see why le moko' s so untouchable .
your people are funny .
this can' t go on any longer .
arresting pp in a place like the casbah isn' t child' s play .
it takes time .
time !
he' s eluded you for two years .
and it' s cost us five detectives .
too high a price for so little .
true .
but don' t forget he got here the day after the toulon bank job .
remember ?
sure , the machine guns , the car chase , and two million gone .
that' s when you should' ve intercepted him .
the continental police are so " organized " !
hello , chief .
meet inspectorjanvier from paris .
i know .
carry on .
i was explaining our failure to catch pp le moko .
the casbah .
just as i said .
i' il go up there tomorrow to see how the land lies .
how the land lies .
funny !
the casbah is like a labyrinth .
i' il show you .
you can say pp' s gone underground .
from the air , the district known as the casbah
looks like a teeming anthill , a vast staircase where terraces descend stepwise to the sea .
between these steps are dark , winding streets like so many pitfalls .
they intersect , overlap , twist in and out , to form a jumble of mazes .
some are narrow , others vaulted .
wherever you look , stairways climb steeply like ladders , or descend into dark , putrid chasms and slimy porticos , dank and lice infested .
dark , overcrowded cafs .
silent , empty streets with odd names ...
inadequacy st .
soum soum st .
honey hotel st .
man wlth a pearl st .
apopulation of 40, 000 in an area meant for 10, 000 .
from all over the world .
many , descended from the barbarians , are honest traditionalists , but a mystery to us .
kabyles .
chinese .
gypsies .
stateless .
slavs .
maltese .
negroes .
sicilians .
spaniards .
and girls of all nations , shapes and sizes .
the tall .
the fat .
the short .
the ageless .
the shapeless .
chasms of fat no one would dare approach .
the houses have inner courtyards , which are like ceilingless cells that echo like wells and interconnect by means of the terraces above .
they' re the exclusive domain of native women .
but europeans are tolerated .
they form a city apart , which , step by step , stretches down to the sea .
colorful , dynamic , multifaceted , boisterous , there' s not one casbah but hundreds .
thousands .
and this teeming maze is what pp calls home .
catching him is no piece of cake .
he' s well protected .
he has his gang .
every crook is his accomplice .
news travels from terrace to terrace .
no need for newspapers .
he has spies on every rooftop .
doors open and close , and no one knows why .
guns go off by themselves .
he has friends where we have enemies .
ask inspector slimane .
the devil' s son always works with demonic children .
le moko ?
a prince of plunder .
fifteen convictions , 33 daylight robberies , two bank holdups .
and burglaries ?
we haven' t enough fingers in this room on which to count them all .
how could he not be admired ?
and such a good boy !
he wears his heart on his sleeve .
as quick with a smile for friends as a knife for foes .
so charming !
slimane sees him daily in the casbah .
and you don' t arrest him ?
i have my plan .
in the casbah , he' d kill me without blinking .
i' m tolerated .
that' s something .
you' re too lazy to worry him .
i watch out .
for your hide .
i' ve only one !
we' il clean up the casbah tonight .
we' il get him dead or alive .
nice , very nice .
nice , very nice .
this gem is a tribute to your taste and expertise , pp .
can it !
how much you offering ?
you' re like a fidgety coquette .
we' re talking dough .
carlos , my friend , your words fail to shine likejapanese pearls .
slang is a phony language .
cut the gab !
cough up the bread !
you talk like a baker .
this ruby has such sex appeal !
my dear pp , this burglary does you credit .
what' s on your mind ?
nothing .
my palm looks like an oyster shell .
it hurts to part with this , grandpa .
i can' t take my eyes off this beauty spot .
what' s your offer , grandpa ?
let him think .
he thinks , we lose .
grandpa' s a friend .
and for two years now .
i' ve always been behind your company .
your mistrust offends me .
well said , grandpa !
sure , stick up for him !
you' re not straight !
not straight ?
no !
you should' ve seen him slice up some fox stoles with a razor !
a razor ?
a real vandal !
a what ?
repeat that !
real sabotage .
you pain me .
what ?
say that again !
you pain me .
he says you pain him .
i got it .
i was a cabinetmaker as a kid so i respect good craftsmanship .
i don' t go slicing up fox stoles .
i snatch them , that' s all .
and i know my place .
right , jim ?
right , max ?
right , pierrot ?
and how , pp .
sure , they always say you' re right .
i' m square with them .
and i ain' t ?
you' ve got business on the brain .
fork it over !
you' re no man , but a cash register .
a what ?
come now , gentlemen , be civilized .
i got it .
police !
no , rgis .
let me in !
where' s pp ?
we have to warn him .
a busload of cops .
like a wedding party after the groom .
so soon ?
you were expecting them ?
it' s about yesterday' s jewel robbery .
i' il warn him .
where is he ?
at grandpa' s .
he' s safe .
what a relief !
i was in such a sweat .
i could almost see him handcuffed like a two bit hood .
you' re sweet , rgis .
i' m a sensitive fellow .
but pp' s not your friend .
well , i' m his , even if he doesn' t like me .
but one day , i' il prove myself .
i' m not a talker , but i admire him so discreetly he' il have to take notice someday .
thanks , rgis .
good luck , ins .
i' il go over the terrace .
seen pp le moko ?
me ?
never heard of him .
look out !
police !
pp , it' s me .
rgis sent me .
the police are closing in .
can' t we think in peace ?
let' s scram !
where' s the fire !
we' ve seen cops before .
where are you going ?
to get a look .
not you , pierrot .
don' t you trust me ?
not you , i said .
there' s no risk !
you' re too young .
it' s rgis .
he' s at grandpa' s .
the corner house .
they' re coming here .
someone squealed .
no .
sure .
someone knew i was here .
you' re imagining things .
you saw someone .
i saw rgis .
so you saw rgis .
he warned me .
i' m fond of you .
why do you say that ?
because you' re a child .
i think your activities don' t allow you to stay here .
shove over !
they' ve got a shooting gallery mentality .
let me through !
quick !
in here !
stay here , my beauty .
you might get hurt outside .
what' s going on ?
oh , nothing much .
nothing ?
you' re funny .
the police are after a man .
don' t bother !
they' re not the talkative kind !
relax , i won' t hurt them .
i aim at the legs .
good for varicose veins .
four so far !
four varicose veins ?
no , cops !
are you hurt ?
it' s nothing .
give me that !
stay here .
you' re hit ?
just a flesh wound .
one !
two !
three !
she counts so nicely !
tell them to hold their fire .
and you run on home !
your place is at home .
you saw nothing .
what can i have seen ?
you heard nothing .
i' m one eyed and going deaf .
doesn' t the noise bother you ?
i' m used to it .
have they been after him long ?
two years .
the police are so stupid .
aren' t they ?
don' t you agree ?
absolutely .
especially tonight .
where does he live ?
just opposite ?
sometimes in here on the side of the heart , sometimes , the other .
home is wherever he finds a woman .
here , he' s the caid' s caid .
caid ?
the boss .
his favorite is ins , a gypsy .
don' t say it so loud .
when he' s killed , there will be 3, 000 widows at his funeral .
patch me up , angel .
not with them , slimane ?
hasty work is sloppy work .
shouia .
slow is better .
don' t like to brawl , my little beagle ?
no , my little fox .
excuse us if we talk shop , ma' am .
cigarette ?
i won' t say no .
let me help you .
so , they surrounded the house ?
funny , they thought i was at grandpa' s .
he can' t even sleep in peace anymore .
so you fired at them ?
a few pot shots .
at the legs , as usual .
i love ninepins .
but they won' t get me this way .
i couldn' t agree more .
you see !
you see , we finally agree on something .
i' il get you , pp .
but in my own way .
if god is willing .
i can' t wait !
i' il get the others , too .
pierrot , carlos , jimmy , max , the lot .
and alive .
for the zoo ?
you' re not rare enough animals .
that' s not nice .
you' re gutter lions .
i' il catch you with my bare hands .
without props .
think so ?
it' s written .
shouia .
slowly .
by attrition .
you' re not big enough , sonny .
care to bet ?
a hundred francs .
twenty dourous .
you' re too ambitious .
not ambitious , just patient .
i can wait .
i tend to stand people up .
i know how to wait in one place .
one day you' il forget and walk into my sights .
our friend slimane is funny .
he means it .
he wants to arrest me .
delusions of grandeur !
i' il get you .
it' s written .
sure , sure , sure .
you' re funny .
and how much time will i do ?
consult a fortune teller .
and if i kill you ?
insh' allah !
you despise me too much to kill me .
you have a good mug .
do i ?
you wear your badge on your face .
to look this phony , now that' s honesty !
your compliments touch me .
you deserve them .
i must be going .
business calls .
let' s go .
luck be with you , pp .
what an amazing fellow !
isn' t he ?
i think it' s over .
i' il take you back .
with pleasure .
i lost my friends .
they must have gone home .
isn' t pp le moko amusing ?
he' s entertaining .
but you won' t arrest him .
i' ve written the date of his arrest on the wall of my room where the sun shines .
not bad for a fiasco !
no police operation was better named .
for a cleanup , it was a wipeout .
spare us your jokes .
it' s not a joke , it' s an image .
forget about arresting pp in the casbah .
not even this " grandpa " fellow who greets us with a hail of lead ?
we arrested him twice .
he had alibis .
we all but apologized to him .
ever search his place ?
four times .
and ?
four times nothing .
he' s god up there .
you don' t arrest god .
in paris , we' re not so easily discouraged .
but you have means .
exactly .
your best means is the information you get from us informers .
the only way to arrest pp is to get him into town .
but he knows the score .
he' s no dumber than you are .
what we need is bait .
pierrot .
pp loves pierrot like a brother , a brother who could be his son .
you get my meaning ?
not really .
i get pierrot to come into town .
you collar him .
you keep it under your hat .
mystery and discretion are your trump cards .
pp starts to worry .
what does he do ?
he comes looking for him , like a worried mother .
he falls into your snare like a confused rabbit .
child' s play !
what do you say ?
why not ?
how about you gentlemen ?
it remains to be seen .
why not call in the army to clean up the casbah ?
algeria was already taken by marshal bugeaud .
are we agreed ?
agreed .
and the reward ?
agreed , too .
but can we trust you ?
no double dealing ?
i' m an informer , not a hypocrite .
how will you get pierrot down ?
i have a brilliant plan .
pierrot has a mother , whom he loves .
he' s a bad boy , but a good son .
we don' t arrest the son , but the bad boy .
how ?
the great thing about my plan is that it has to stay a secret .
is the " ayrab " here ?
i need paper .
tonight , you can add pierrot' s name to your list of arrests .
what' s so funny ?
i' m not laughing .
i' m watching you sell out your friends retail .
you' re a born trader , rgis .
you deliver door to door .
that supposed to be an insult ?
what are you looking at , pp ?
nothing .
the sea .
the boats .
doesn' t it make you seasick ?
doesn' t it give you a headache asking stupid questions ?
you have a headache ?
no , a ship ache !
don' t shout .
i' m not .
i' m thinking .
about what ?
about stuff .
you shouldn' t think about stuff .
you' re not used to it .
that' s why you have a headache .
when will i get out of this place ?
you starting again ?
i' m like england .
my future is on the waves .
do i bore you ?
no , ins , algiers bores me .
i' d go with you .
that' s impossible .
if you came with me , you' d be a sort of portable casbah .
two years of the casbah , two years of you .
it' s getting to be a round figure .
ins morning , noon and night .
you' re no woman , you' re a diet !
you didn' t used to say that .
i was being polite .
you , polite ?
yes , polite .
i' ve been fed up for six months .
but i kept my mouth shut for you .
so show some tact .
with or without tact , you can never escape the casbah .
they want to arrest you .
but you' re already under arrest .
just try to get out .
one step out , and it' s " good bye , pp !
thank heavens for the police !
will you shut up !
forget about paris !
no more paris , no more marseille .
nothing but the casbah !
shut up , i tell you !
are you finished ?
no , i love you !
and i' m not finished !
i' il shut you up !
hello , tania .
carlos doesn' t talk like that .
no , he never talks .
he acts .
he beats you ?
yes , it relaxes him .
and since you' re a woman , you take it without complaining .
i' ve always been beaten .
when i did the music halls , my crooner boyfriend used to slap me around because i was more popular .
i got a face men like to clout .
i' ve tried changing it .
i' ve been a redhead , a brunette , a blonde , but nothing doing .
i can' t dye my hair green !
they' ve calmed down .
pp ?
he wouldn' t hurt a fly .
you don' t say !
did you hear all that ?
hello , old girl .
women will be your undoing , pp .
relax .
i give them my body but i keep my head .
who knows when i might need it , right ?
but when they say " i love you , " they don' t practice discretion .
what do you expect ?
it' s my sex appeal .
going down ?
get home all right ?
no problem .
meet any shady types ?
who ?
you .
i was very cuddly with you .
and your girlfriend ?
i took her back to her hotel .
what' d she say ?
nothing much .
she just talked .
i don' t really listen to women .
what did you think of her ?
not bad .
with lip rouge !
in platinum with small diamonds .
and a " to hell with you " attitude .
what' d she say ?
you charm them all to pieces .
sure , but this one' s a little queen .
did she mention me ?
she got to you .
she' s as different from ins as a phonograph from a wireless .
what did she say ?
she asked lots of questions .
and what did you answer ?
nothing .
i kept thinking i hadn' t answered that question you' d asked me .
oh , sure !
so , what do i get if you arrest me ?
twenty years , with a good lawyer .
you love me too much for that .
don' t make me turn you into a stiff .
you have such nice curls .
what' s her name ?
who ?
the sister last night .
you must really like her , pp .
just a passing fancy .
let' s go to chani' s .
i have a mother , too , pierrot .
have confidence .
but i sent her the money order .
why doesn' t she come ?
what did she write ?
that she was waiting to get over a cold .
we' re not in normandy .
she still has to cross france .
she' s 72 .
so what ?
my mother died at 82 in an accident , coming home from a dance .
stop yakkin ' and come play cards !
grandpa wants to win the trick .
right , grandpa ?
win the trick at belote ?
this game is beneath one' s honor .
quit making a fuss .
belote is just the poor man' s bridge .
i never use the vernacular except when i' m with one of those " gentlemen " who think french is a dead language .
c' mon , pierrot .
mister chic and me are waiting .
hello , yaslema pp .
is pierrot around ?
he' s down at chani' s .
pierrot' s new girl is cute .
his new girl is albert' s old girl .
i arrested him during the last ramadan .
praise be to god , he went down for 20 years , as well .
why " as well " ?
no reason .
i have a letter for him .
i' il give it to him .
i can' t .
why not ?
i was told to give it to pierrot .
i' m his woman .
it' s the same thing .
i never gave it to you .
say what you want .
more shenanigans !
the " shenani gangster " isn' t who you think .
the what ?
nothing .
it' s a neologism .
a neo ...
i got it .
you' re lucky .
how' s the game , grandpa ?
look at your friend carlos .
doesn' t he look like a losing card ?
count me in .
carlos plays a brutal hand .
a tactical error .
be careful how you play !
i' d have played the ace .
i smell trouble .
or the queen , not the jack .
stop sneezing at my hand .
you have no hand .
thank you !
and get off my back .
why ?
i have an itch .
you' re so nervous .
consider yourself excluded .
got it ?
go home !
read this and wait outside .
listen , pierrot .
your pal rgis ...
i don' t like you two together .
why not ?
some clocks read 2 o' clock and chime 4 when it' s only 11 : 45 .
rgis doesn' t ring true .
you can' t prove that .
i' m telling you .
he' s straight with me .
maybe , but don' t be pals .
well , i like him .
there are two things , pp .
for business , you' re the boss .
then there' s the rest .
i don' t need anyone for that .
you don' t need anyone ?
lucky for you i like you .
now run along .
he' s just a kid .
well ?
it' s strange .
your mother arriving without letting you know .
not even a cable .
exactly !
is she stingy ?
it depends .
maybe she wanted to surprise you .
but she wrote !
it' s funny she would arrive here sick .
she' s never traveled before .
where' s she staying ?
at a friend' s .
12 trough st.
you know it ?
i do .
i could take you there .
it' s a safe neighborhood .
but tell me , are you sure it' s her handwriting ?
you have any other letters ?
sure .
put them side by side , like siamese twins .
we' il see if it' s the same mother .
let' s go to the house .
carlos , you lost your tricks for the fifth time .
slimane is a delightful good luck charm .
cops bring me bad luck .
go buzz somewhere else .
i don' t like bluebottles .
don' t get excited , i' il move .
but it won' t change your luck if it' s bad .
have a good game and bon appetit .
so long , slimane .
you' re too brutal .
and you' re not brutal enough .
i can' t stomach slimane .
slimane' s a regular guy .
sure , regular .
sure , he' s a cop , but he understands things .
when pierrot deserted and came here , he looked the other way .
slimane is welcome so long as i' m in the casbah .
you' re too good .
like with pierrot , you' re too soft .
kick their butts !
you' re too sentimental .
you pain me .
repeat that ?
you pain me .
he says you pain him .
i got it .
your play .
i have 50 .
no mistake about it .
it' s from my old lady .
looks like it .
same spelling mistakes .
same " m.
what ?
same " m.
same simple way of crossing her " t' s .
but this one looks a little shaky .
my old lady has a fever .
you have an answer to everything .
her temperature must' ve been 104 here .
this isn' t a letter , it' s a thermometer .
would you go if you were me ?
sure .
i can' t leave her alone .
she knew you as a child .
is this street far ?
an hour , round trip .
let' s go .
i' il never forget you doing this for me .
you' re a pal .
i' m good natured .
a nice little lunch , mr. slimane ?
a nice little lunch , mr. slimane ?
why not ?
i feel an appetite coming on for good things .
ajackal' s appetite !
we don' t often serve mr. slimane .
gluttony doesn' t usually mix with my usual occupations .
be it as god wills .
who are those four people there ?
mr. kleep , of kleep champagnes , his lady friend , his associate and lady friend .
i see .
seat me next to them .
the pleasure of their company will add to the menu .
sulking , maxime dear ?
it' s the heat .
and my head .
and my stomach .
i feel nauseous .
is that all ?
algeria doesn' t agree with you .
he' s too old .
i never felt better in my life .
you enjoy contradicting me .
you don' t love me .
come on , old man .
who asked you ?
she doesn' t love me .
it' s a fact .
i adore you , so calm down !
wipe your face .
you' re handsome .
smile .
you' re all sweaty .
your skin sticks like taffy .
inspector !
come have something with us .
a cocktail .
mr. kleep , miss berthier , mr. gravre ...
inspector slimane .
have a seat .
what will you have ?
thank you .
i don' t drink .
where was i last night , during the shooting ?
with me .
you see ?
and who did i meet ?
pp le moko .
what connections !
business connections .
you don' t choose them .
the cutthroat they' re talking about ?
the gangster , yes .
you saw him again ?
this morning .
did he mention me ?
to be frank ...
he liked my pearls .
he can still admire the woman .
pp' s a fellow with taste .
what' s he like ?
charming ... and frightening .
i want to see him !
i want to know what he thinks , how he ended up in the casbah .
it must be thrilling !
that can be arranged , provided you have a guide .
for a lady without an escort , the casbah ...
whenever you like .
i' m at your service .
as soon as you can .
tonight , then ?
once was enough for me .
i hate the lice and the stench !
we' il go with gravre , all right ?
i love adventure !
i' il spray myself with pesticide .
so , inspector , this evening , if you like ...
where' s pierrot ?
how should i know ?
weren' t you with him ?
on the way down , but not coming back .
hasn' t he come back ?
what did he tell you ?
he just said " see you later .
he didn' t say when .
you' ve got a face to scare someone off his feet .
go check at grandpa' s .
here' s the bank .
the main entrance .
the staff entrance .
follow me ?
i follow you .
go on .
tomorrow at 2 p . m .
the cashier brings the money here .
this is all from a sure source .
here' s the cash desk , the strong room .
the safe is here .
grandpa , you' re outside .
you fade into the background .
into the background !
not so easy !
i' il wear my brown suit , pearl gray tie and suede vest .
who is it ?
is that you , pierrot ?
it' s ayesha .
grandpa , it' s my pierrot .
i' ve looked all over .
you tried chani' s ?
yes .
i' ve looked everywhere .
i can' t find him anywhere .
he should' ve been back by now .
back ?
where from ?
12 trough st.
he went down into town ?
yes , to see his mother .
to see his mother ?
she' s sick .
what' s this nonsense ?
someone brought him a letter .
who did ?
the " ayrab .
so pierrot went right down with rgis .
then rgis came back .
now i' m waiting for pierrot .
that' s all .
and where' s rgis ?
at the algerian' s .
no need to spell it out .
let' s go !
see you later .
stick around .
i' m in a hurry .
let' s wait for pierrot .
you' il leave when he gets back .
look , pp ...
no " look . " c' mon .
you afraid of something ?
why should i be afraid ?
yes , why ?
but usually you never even say hello to me , so i' m a bit disconcerted .
i underestimated you .
i was wrong .
come on .
where ?
in here .
i hear you' re a brave man .
surprised ?
and you proved it .
you can be naturally brave without knowing it .
like when you took pierrot down to trough st. that was nice .
you heard about that ?
naturally .
in here .
you' re a good guy , rgis .
a real man .
i' m just a friend .
sure you are .
tell me , when did you leave pierrot ?
right away .
on trough street ?
he went to see his old mother .
so she' s in algiers ?
i don' t know .
but he went to see her .
it seems he got a letter from her .
but you read this letter ?
so there' s no " it seems " ?
then you two left together .
then you came back alone .
that' s normal .
what could be more normal ?
need me ?
no , we' re just chatting .
sit down .
rgis and pierrot went down to trough st.
fine .
so you' re waiting for poor pierrot .
why " poor pierrot " ?
because he went with rgis .
so what ?
you' re right , pp .
you' re waiting for pierrot with poor rgis .
you feeling hot ?
i can' t breathe !
buck up , old man .
sure , you' re worried about pierrot .
have a drink .
don' t break the glass .
what' s the matter with me ?
you' il feel better in an hour .
let me go , pp !
you can' t just leave .
with a fever like that ?
cigarette ?
don' t make such a fuss .
smoke it .
his hair' s a bit long in the back .
should i cut it ?
you were fond of pierrot .
i still am .
then you can' t go until he gets back .
you want to know .
you' re hot .
i feel bad .
he' s burning .
burned , even .
let me go !
i have nothing to do with his absence !
let me go !
please !
you know me .
i' m a regular fellow !
let me out , pp !
let me out of here !
he' s raving .
poor guy !
he should stay in bed .
don' t do anything foolish .
watch out for chills , my good man .
what' s going on ?
we' re giving mr. rgis some last aid .
is he sick ?
he' s feeling indisposed .
a slight blackout .
come along , my good man .
ins , go get pierrot at 12 trough st.
bring him back here , if you can .
the sooner you do , the sooner rgis feels better .
move it !
12 trough st.
a game of cards ?
if you want .
cut , rgis .
spades , the death card !
not good .
where' s pp ?
my friends want to meet him .
the brunette .
the one with the diamonds .
yesterday , by chance ...
no , there is no chance ...
she saw him and then ran into him again .
but why bother explaining ?
you know you make all women jealous .
why tell me this ?
because i respect you .
so tell me , my sweet , where' s pp ?
i don' t know .
have a nice walk , child .
if you' il come this way ...
trumps .
play your heart .
you asked for it .
sorry , i' m not feeling myself .
where are you , then ?
stay with us .
he' s thinking of pierrot .
the undertaker !
the one eye !
if our friend and collaborator doesn' t come back soon ,
i' il be very anxious .
it won' t be funny .
no , it' d be awful .
but he' il be back , i tell you .
i' m sure of it , rgis old pal .
what ?
i' il be right out .
play without me .
i' il be right back .
you boys look after rgis .
never abandon a friend in need .
you still here ?
a glass of anisette ?
i love this place !
oh , delectable !
a vision out of the arabian nights !
a night to spend a day with .
i love to travel .
i always imagine i' m somewhere else .
in corsica , i felt like i was in turkey .
here , i' m in china !
a phonograph !
let' s have some music .
cheka tema ...
it must be native music .
that should be funny !
so what do you think of the strange animal ?
strange , but not such an animal .
how do you like my burg ?
i don' t like the provinces .
once past the paris city limits , i feel ill at ease .
really ?
if i can' t wake up to paris ,
i want to go back to sleep .
you know paris ?
it was my last burg ...
rue saint martin .
the champs elyses .
gare du nord .
the opera .
the boulevards .
barbs .
la chapelle .
rue montmartre .
blvd .
rochechouart .
rue fontaine .
place blanche !
small world , isn' t it ?
got a rif ?
you understand ?
we' re neighbors .
do your eyes hurt ?
your gems .
not afraid they' il get swiped ?
not with you .
right you are .
excuse me .
rgis ?
he' s on his last hand .
congrats !
the kid' s hardware must be worth a mint .
so ?
don' t fall asleep .
cut it out .
need a hand ?
cut it out , i said !
what ?
i' m old enough to know what to do .
so if you don' t like it ...
i got it .
this should be more fun .
what' s his problem ?
nothing .
he' s complicated .
this is fine stuff !
and they don' t weigh much .
look !
what' s it all worth ?
two grand ?
add a zero .
my selling price !
put them back on .
you put them back on .
shall we dance ?
what' s your name ?
gisle .
gaby for short .
you a widow ?
why ?
who are you with ?
a gentleman .
what' s he like ?
jealous .
you in a hotel ?
yes , the aletti .
what' s so funny ?
nothing .
a pity .
a pity ?
a pity i don' t know you better .
why ?
so i could smack you one .
i hate people laughing without me knowing why .
this reminds me of bastille day , when i was a kid , in the gobelins .
you from the gobelins ?
can' t you tell ?
i went to school on rue de i' arbalte .
just around the corner !
imagine that !
let' s take a walk .
where ?
on the terrace .
there' s a view of the port .
not tonight .
i' m not alone .
when , then ?
later .
when ?
tomorrow .
you' il be gone by then .
i' il come back .
promise ?
promise .
you want that , kid ?
have some respect .
what for ?
because you don' t usually .
where' s pierrot ?
i don' t know .
didn' t you go ?
i couldn' t leave you alone .
i' m with the lady .
where is he ?
who ?
rgis .
come with me .
so he squealed on you ?
you were right .
forgive me .
where is he ?
i saved him for you .
where are they ?
gone .
they were scared .
the boy came of good stock .
of course , he sort of deserted .
he hated the army .
personally , i admire the uniform .
they' re putting him in cold storage now .
he' s cashed in his chips .
you' il get sick if you drink like that .
i was fond of pierrot .
are you done ?
can' t we even talk ?
well ?
well , it' s over .
no more pierrot .
i was alone at the cemetery .
i did as the gypsies do .
a handful of dirt over his body .
pierrot can sleep in peace now .
you have a heavy heart .
you couldn' t even escort him to his final resting place .
i' m your friend .
i feel for you .
but don' t worry .
one day , your enemies won' t stop you from leaving the casbah .
what do you mean ?
you' il go like pierrot .
feet first .
if you' re patient , you' il have the last word then .
i' il go when i want .
and alive .
don' t get upset .
i know you .
you' re not crazy .
what' s all this ?
that' s enough !
enough of that racket !
you saw her again ?
who ?
gaby , the woman the other night .
wasn' t she a beauty ?
a pity .
why a pity ?
a pity she won' t be back .
she' s a lady who dislikes disturbances .
you feel hurt .
what ?
why should i care ?
so you say .
enough out of you !
get on home !
go on !
get out , all of you !
you , too !
i don' t want to see anybody .
but she said she' d come again .
a pity .
pierrot is dead and the woman you desired ...
there are such days .
she ain' t coming back and that suits you fine .
her rocks .
woulda been a snap !
get off my back !
guys with all flash and no fire burn me up !
no moonlight serenades for me !
get the hell out !
no need to insist .
i got it .
your friends lack tact .
they don' t respect the appeal of your sorrow .
shakespearean style is out of fashion nowadays .
i can see how they disgust you .
get off my back !
i' il go into town when i like !
i' m a free man , you hear !
and i' ve had enough of all your yapping !
i' il go when i feel like it .
right now , even !
i' m going down now !
she can' t come up , but i can go down .
and no one will stop me , you hear ?
what' s the matter ?
he' s mad !
he' s going into the city .
he won' t listen to reason .
it' s slimane .
le moko' s coming out .
post men at new gate st. , casbah st. and ramdam st.
he' s drunk .
we' ve got him .
quick !
pp , you' re crazy .
don' t go !
don' t go !
i' m not jealous !
she' s up there !
she' s at the house .
she' s waiting for you .
up there .
where is she ?
where is she ?
so you were pulling my leg ?
a cock and bull story ?
answer me .
answer me !
it was the only way to stop you .
you do this to me ?
begging for myself wouldn' t stop you .
so ...
you' re right .
i' m an idiot .
i' m sorry .
aren' t you fed up with a guy like me ?
i' m rotten .
you are what you are .
a good kid like you should have it easy .
it' s not fair .
but here we are , the two of us .
you run so fast .
i really stepped on it .
but i caught up with you .
you' re a real champ !
i' m thirsty .
it' s just like me .
nothing in its gut .
i' m going for a drink .
i kept my promise .
here i am .
you look strange !
we didn' t say good bye the other night , so i came to say hello .
c' mon !
is she there ?
she' s a walking ice palace .
the sparklers she' s got on her !
looking for pp ?
no , why ?
he' s busy .
i' m not looking for him .
in case you were , i just ran into him .
i didn' t ask you .
he' s with the girl with the diamonds .
will you come again ?
tomorrow .
you sure ?
same time .
here ?
i really like you .
you' re beautiful .
and being with you is like being in paris .
with you i escape , you see ?
you' re a different landscape .
i was pretending to sleep earlier .
i let my mind wander .
you know what i heard ?
the mtro .
can you imagine ?
the mtro !
you taunt me with diamonds , you' re wearing silk and gold , but you remind me of the mtro and frites and caf au lait on caf terraces .
that' s what you' re like .
what did you do before ?
before what ?
before the diamonds .
i dreamed of them .
i have to go .
if you don' t come ...
what will you do ?
you really can' t get rid of this casbah ?
why do you ask ?
no , they' ve got me boxed in .
i can' t hole up anywhere else .
they' re hunting me .
if i leave here , they nail me .
happy now ?
you' re reassured .
i' m neither happy nor reassured .
you' re right , because i could do anything , even come looking for you .
until tomorrow , pp .
i always keep my promises .
you smell so good .
it' s the mtro .
in first class .
take her to marengo st.
did it go all right ?
got the gems ?
what gems ?
what gems ?
the lady' s !
what were you doing together ?
watercolors !
water what ?
i got it .
oh , what a splendid day
the sun shines along my way
the sun shines along my way
is that pp le moko ?
he sounds so happy !
he must have come into money !
love paints all a rosy shade
it' s the one thing that doesn' t fade
you can say what you may
it' s sad when it goes away
all you need for a life ofbliss
is a sweet miss
something' s up .
love paints all a rosy shade
it' s the one thing that doesn' t fade
you can say what you may
it' s sad when it goes away
what' s got into you ?
i' ve got a rendezvous today on place blanche !
you' ve gone mad !
i' m mad , and it' s a great feeling !
we have to have fun today !
today' s sunday !
it' s thursday .
i tell you it' s sunday !
hello , carlos .
how are things ?
shopping with your dame ?
he still treats you with kindness ?
he' s not the kind to sing .
it' s business first .
what' s that ?
go easy !
i got it .
you' re happy .
to see you .
have you seen gaby again ?
you' re nosy !
she came again ?
such lovely curls !
did she come again ?
you must sweep ' em off their feet .
did she come ?
will she come ?
what mascara do you use ?
you naughty thing !
did she make a date ?
so long , inspector darling .
and keep what i said under your hat !
well ?
this is going to be difficult , but i have to do it .
your friend miss gaby is overly fond of local color .
she spends her time in the casbah .
what' s all this about ?
the casbah is a place where caution must be taken .
an unaccompanied woman is an object of desire .
so i can' t insist enough that you keep an eye on your friend and advise her to ...
it would be a pity if there was an accident .
i didn' t notice anything .
of course not .
but let me make this clear .
miss gaby must not return to the casbah .
thank you .
you needn' t worry .
i got it .
you can come at 5 : 00 .
make sure everything looks right .
i want cushions and ashtrays , and vases with flowers .
no problem .
and water the flowers with eau de cologne .
i' il use my " rve dejava " !
it smells like violets !
and put out a table with two settings .
i' il handle the grub and the juice .
all this for his new bird !
she' s no bird !
why ?
birds are nice .
sure , my turtledove !
five o' clock sharp .
going out ?
to do what ?
to take a walk .
where ?
bois de vincennes .
i want a serious answer !
then stop asking stupid questions .
i don' t know anyone here .
i just walk straight ahead .
and where do you end up ?
i' il find out .
you' re staying here !
oh , no !
your hotel' s as dreary as a funeral parlor .
whenever i come back here , it' s like walking into a family vault .
good bye , darling .
i know where you' re going .
so show me the way .
to the casbah , as usual .
as usual ?
to meet pp le moko .
so you' re spying on me now ?
you' re with me , you stay with me .
what for ?
i won' t have you behave like a ...
a what ?
like a ...
exactly !
that' s what i am to you .
shut up !
i say what everyone knows .
look at yourself , then look at me .
you stay !
don' t waste your time !
if you go , don' t bother coming back .
my mind' s made up .
here !
you can have your investment back .
stay here !
have my mail forwarded .
i must be crazy !
no need going to the casbah .
why not ?
inspector meunier acted in self defense .
so ?
so he fired .
there' s no more pp le moko .
alas .
i knew she' d stand him up .
he' s got feelings .
well , i' m going down into town and personally take care of the lady' s sparklers .
which boat ?
city of oran ?
at 10 a . m .
prepare my bill and make reservations ...
are you coming ?
not staying for the funeral ?
four first class cabins .
have two whiskies sent up .
will you have a little whiskey ?
just what a widow needs .
you look dead .
somebody turn off the juice ?
i' ve had it with the casbah .
you too ?
it weighs on me , too .
i know how you feel , pp .
we don' t always see eye to eye on business .
but we agree on principles .
what do you mean ?
i' m going into town to see what' s what .
we gotta find a dodge to get outta here .
be a good guy .
give me some tips .
when are you going ?
now .
why wait ?
i' il fill you in on something .
sure , i' il case the joint .
since you' re going down , do me a favor .
let' s hear it .
deliver a letter for me .
can i count on you ?
so long as it' s not too heavy .
it' s for your society lady .
don' t blush .
just give me your note .
bring me a pen and some paper .
so you wait for an answer .
i' il be back in two hours .
i' il be with tania at ma tarte' s .
i' d rather not be at ins' s .
she' d only ask questions .
at ma tarte' s in 2 hours .
tell tania .
what time is it ?
nine o' clock .
it' s light out .
i slept that long ?
and snored even longer !
where' s carlos ?
he' s not back .
i waited up all night .
he won' t come now .
sure he will .
he' s not a kid .
i hope he does .
i' m gonna give him a piece of my mind for being late .
poor carlos .
there are days i could kill myself .
bite your tongue !
do like me .
when i feel down , i change eras .
change eras ?
i think of my youth .
i look at my old photo and imagine it' s a mirror .
i put on one of my old records , from the days when i' d sell out the paris music halls .
i' d go on stage against a country backdrop with a red spotlight on my pale face , and i' d sing ...
some people dream of america
as they see it at the cinema
a magnificent land they swear
our paris just can' t compare
that kind of talk makes them bold
when they feel blue and want to holler
but theyjust end up hungry and old
in new york scrounging for a dollar
among the criminals and outcasts
and emigrants with broken pasts
they sing of paris at last
where' s my windmill on place blanche
my tobacco shop , my corner caf
when every day was a new chance
where are all the friends who made my day
where are the dance halls where we' d meet
the songs the accordionist would play
where are the places where we could eat
without a cent in our pockets to pay
where are they now
is pp here ?
what is it ?
i couldn' t find you .
who let him in ?
i must speak to you .
alone .
there are no false witnesses here .
we' re silent as the grave .
no one will talk .
i' m rotten .
i know .
worse than that .
not likely .
insult me .
i deserve it .
you got delusions of grandeur ?
it' s about that letter from pierrot' s mother .
i took it to ayesha , not knowing it was police bait .
had i known , i' d never have taken it to ayesha !
a woman gave it to me .
i didn' t suspect a thing .
i' m an informer , but i have limits .
you' re only a half weasel .
that' s why i came .
for what ?
i couldn' t take it anymore .
it was weighing on me .
forgive me , pp .
don' t run yourself down .
i want your respect .
i want to win it back .
carlos is done for .
what ?
what' s this ?
it' s the truth .
you squealed ?
i wouldn' t be here .
carlos , pierrot ...
it' s your turn next .
stop it !
they arrested him ?
who did ?
inspector meunier and his men .
they cornered him .
did they shoot ?
no , it was a clean arrest .
clean !
a dirty trick !
i was there when they brought him in .
i got near him .
he slipped me the letter you gave him .
take it to the aletti hotel .
it' s for a woman .
so i took it , like he said .
always playing the mailman !
shut up !
so you write to women ?
and he says it in front of me !
don' t like it ?
get out .
you never wrote me a romantic letter !
so you saw the lady ?
so give !
the reply .
she couldn' t write .
she' s being watched .
but she' s waiting for you .
her hotel window overlooks the port .
she' s on the lookout .
she' il let you in .
go through the casino .
is that all ?
she said she couldn' t get away .
you' re not going ?
get off my back !
she' s waiting .
what message do i give her ?
waiting , is she ?
i' il take the reply myself .
you wait here .
they' il keep you company .
i' m expected .
then i' il wait .
carlos say anything else ?
nothing .
did they search him ?
so they swiped the 5, 000 francs ?
he didn' t slip them to you ?
you sure ?
on my honor !
come off it !
louvain took them .
he put them in his desk .
so gaby couldn' t write since she' s being watched ?
by her friend .
but she can see me later ?
sure , on the docks behind the hotel .
funny , isn' t it ?
her friend won' t be there .
but why can' t she write ?
her friend was there .
then how could she talk to you ?
because ...
because what ?
your story doesn' t hold together .
how could they have taken 5, 000 off carlos when he hadn' t a cent on him ?
but i saw 5, 000 .
and do you think carlos would give you my letter ?
you wrote one , didn' t you ?
you think i' d believe carlos could be that stupid ?
i give you my word .
keep it !
so you wanted to deliver my reply .
so her friend will be out ?
for a woman being watched , she' s a bit free .
the joke' s over , ayrab !
now you come clean !
spill the beans !
there' s nothing else to say !
yes , there is !
you' re choking me !
just a clinch !
i told you the truth !
find another truth !
it' s the truth !
shut up !
i swear !
on my father' s head !
no risk !
he was guillotined !
let' s start over .
move and you' re a dead man !
carlos was arrested .
that' s true .
i told you he was .
and you read my letter .
i told you i did .
so far , so good .
but the rest bothers me .
what happened next ?
nothing !
something did !
you' ve got a thick skull !
we' il see just how thick !
you' il hurt him !
spit it out !
do i have to kill you ?
i' il refresh your memory !
it was all slimane' s doing .
he told me to come here .
to tell you what i told you .
he thinks you' il come down .
he has the hotel surrounded .
that' s all .
so you didn' t see her ?
why didn' t she come last night ?
slimane told her you' d been killed .
she sails at 10 : 00 on the city of oran .
that all ?
thanks , then .
go get max and jimmy .
you stay put !
stay where you are .
you' il have to console ins .
with carlos and me gone , that makes two widows .
you' re not going !
what ?
think i' il let her leave without me ?
so long , old girl .
not waiting for ins ?
tell her i got away .
you' re a woman , you know what to say .
i' m going by the house .
so long .
you can' t leave like this , pp !
what did i do wrong ?
you' re a good kid .
don' t be angry .
blame it on the casbah .
let me go .
let me go !
it' s not you i was expecting .
he won' t come .
what are you saying ?
pp' s leaving .
leaving ?
what do you mean ?
he' s at the harbor , waiting to board ship .
we' il see about that .
how wretched you must be !
go on !
let him leave !
five minutes !
the nice thing about traveling is going home .
that way you can leave again .
i' ve had a good time .
even if i' ve always found the sun dreary .
how about you , maxime ?
i' ve never laughed so much .
you see , pp , you showed up for our rendezvous .
i knew i could count on you .
not here , slimane .
as you like .
i can' t refuse you anything .
be a sport .
i just want one last thing .
i can' t escape .
let me watch the boat sail .
i promise i' il stay right here .
i know i can trust you .
forgive me .
