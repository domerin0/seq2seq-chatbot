alan , not again .
come on .
hard work and determination have forged the brantford spirit
since our forefathers first settled this town .
despite the harshness of our climate and granite of our soil , we have ...
prospered .
i knew it ail this morning .
let' s go .
sam , we have to talk to alan .
well , we' re on our way .
i told your father what you told me , that it wasn' t just biily jessup .
if i' d known that ...
it' s okay , dad .
i' m proud of you .
you faced them even though you were outnumbered .
you took it iike a man , therefore we have decided
that you' re ready to go to the cliffside schooi for boys .
congratulations , sweetheart .
you don' t want me iiving here ?
it' s always been the plan that you go to cliffside .
parrishes have been going to cliffside since the 1 700' s .
look at this .
parrish hail .
that' s the main dormitory .
this is great !
people hate me here because i' m a parrish .
wait till i' m iiving in a building named after me .
it was named after my father .
good .
why don' t you live in it ?
i did , and it made me into the man i am today .
maybe i don' t want to be like you .
maybe i don' t want to be a parrish .
you won' t be .
not tiii you start acting like one .
i' m not ready for cliffside then .
we' re taking you there on sunday !
and not another word about it !
i' m never talking to you again !
sam .. .
what ?
nothing .
what are you doing here ?
i brought your bike back .
you didn' t have to .
i was going to get it myself .
i told biily to stop picking on you .
you wasted your breath .
i can' t talk right now .
what was that ?
you heard it , too ?
of course i heard it .
come on , i found this reaily weird game in the factory .
jumanji .
for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind .
roll the dice to move your token .
doubles gets another turn . '
the first to reach the end wins .
you want to play ?
i quit playing board games five years ago .
sarah !
it' s got to be magnetized .
alan , iook .
' when they fly you' d better run .
these winged things are no fun . '
what was that ?
i don' t know .
put it away , alan .
oh , no .
the game thinks i rolled .
what do you mean " ' the game thinks ' " ?
in the jungle you must wait till the dice read five or eight .
in the jungle you must wait ...
what does that mean ?
26 years later . ..
i' il make it a bed and breakfast .
it was pretty hard to pass up .
it' s already fuii of furniture .
i' d forgotten how big this place is .
judy , peter , come look at this .
i' il put a reception area here .
a bar over here in the parlour .
that sounds lovely .
i' m sure you and your kids will be very happy here .
actually , they' re my iate brother' s .
he and his wife passed away .
is this something , or what ?
it sure is .
what do you think , young man ?
is it big enough for you ?
peter hasn' t spoken a word since it happened .
i' m so sorry .
how terribly awful .
it' s okay .
we barely even knew our parents .
they were always away .
skiing in st. moritz .
gambling in monte carlo .
safaris in africa .
we didn' t even know if they loved us .
as the sheik' s yacht went down , they wrote us a goodbye letter .
it was found floating in a champagne bottle .
excuse me ...
devoted parents .
it was a car crash in canada .
wiii you send me the papers ?
first thing tomorrow .
i need a iocksmith .
peter , pick up your toys , please .
take this suitcase up to the attic .
then we can aii have ice cream ... and bourbon .
what is it ?
i' m going to a motel .
for heaven' s sake ...
i don' t see any guano .
he said it looked like that .
that' s an african bat .
some kid saw some in the 60' s , but we don' t get bats iike that here .
but that' s what he saw .
whatever it was , it' s gone now .
bats aren' t what i' d worry about in this house , anyway .
what would you worry about ?
i wouldn' t want to live in a house where someone was murdered .
little alan parrish .
i say his father did it .
there' s 1 , 001 places he could' ve hid the body in this house .
especially if he chopped it up .
you kids don' t want to be iate for your first day of school .
not a bat in sight .
hear that ?
there' s nothing to be afraid of in this house .
i can' t believe i have to see your principal after your first day .
let' s just try to relax and finish our dinner .
we know why you got the house cheap .
26 years ago alan parrish disappeared from this house .
his parents chopped him up and hid him in the walls .
okay , i' m tired of your iies .
you' re grounded !
fine , there' s nowhere to go in this stupid town , anyway .
just for your information , that wasn' t a iie .
did you hear anything a iittle while ago ?
do you miss mom and dad ?
no .
liar .

why would they close parrish shoes ?
when his kid ran away , sam set out to find him .

it' s okay to be afraid .
let' s set it up in the iiving room .
you have no idea what you' re getting yourself into .
we can handle it .
we don' t need your help .
i don' t think so .
monkeys , mosquitoes and iions are just the beginning .
i' ve seen things you' ve only seen in your nightmares .
things you can' t even imagine .
things you can' t even see .
there are things that hunt you in the night .
then something screams .
then you hear them eat .
and you hope to god that you' re not dessert .
afraid ?
you don' t even know what afraid is .
you wiii not iast five minutes without me .
so . .. are you gonna help us ?
i' ii watch . ..
.. . but i' m not afraid .
peter , that was very cool .
that' s reverse psychology .
dad used to try it on me .
ready ?
yeah .
alan , ready ?
there is no ready .
i' ii try it again .
alan , it' s not working .
no .. . it' s not your turn .
peter roiled twice , because he got doubles .
now it' s my turn .

two of the pieces are yours , right ?
whose are the other pieces ?
the elephant was mine .
we' re playing the game i started in 1 969 .
i' m gonna have to play .
it' s not my turn .
whose turn is it ?
sarah whittle .
this is where she used to iive .
this place gives me the creeps .
we used to play on this porch .
i knew she wouldn' t still live here .
she probably married biily jessup .
maybe she' li know where sarah is .
she' ii know .
she' s a psychic .
good point .
i remember the porch being a iot bigger .
can you help us ?
do you have an appointment ?
no , we' re trying to find someone .
madam serena is busy .
maybe you can help us .

dr. boorstein , it' s sarah whittle .
please caii me .
i need to have my dosage checked .
that event we' ve been discussing , the one that didn' t happen . ..
the little boy who didn' t really disappear . ..
i' m sitting in his iiving room drinking iemonade .
he' ii caii me back .
while we' re waiting ...
i' ve spent 2, 000 hours in therapy convincing myself that didn' t exist .
what happened to you was so awful , i made up that whole thing .
it was awful .
it really was ... but it was real .
no , your father murdered you and chopped you up .
sarah !
come on !
my dad did that ?
my father could barely hug me , iet alone cut me into iittle pieces .
26 years ago , we started playing a little game .
now , we' re aii gonna sit down and we' re gonna finish it .
and guess what .
it' s your turn .
play the game , sarah .
ail right , give me the dice .
go home , you don' t have to play .
god !
how could you do that ?
it' s the law of the jungle .
i used to visualize you as a radiant spirit .
go on , read it .
' they grow much faster than bamboo .
take care or they' il come for you . " '
oh , great !
god !
teii me this isn' t happening .
it is .
stay away from the walls .
don' t touch anything .

the game is not over yet .
it is for me .
you are not in the jungle anymore .
anybody up for iced tea ?
i' m gonna make some tea .
please , iast time i played this game it ruined my life .
it ruined your life ? " ' in the jungle you must wait till the dice read five or eight .
i was a iittle girl , alan .
you disappeared .
a bunch of bats surrounded me and chased me down the street .
i was afraid .
i' m sorry , alan .
no one believed me .
i was alone .
so was i , for 26 years .
me , too .
it' s okay , sarah .
we' re scared , too .
but if we finish the game , it' ii ali go away .
what if i get stuck in the game ?
you won' t .
i won' t stop playing .
neither wiil i.
i won' t , either .
come on , sarah .
please .
i knew this was gonna be a bad day .
come on , we' re gonna be fine .
we just have to keep our heads .
we roll with the punches .
the hunter from the darkest wilds .. . .. . makes you feei just iike a child . " '
what is it ?
van pelt .. .
you miserable coward !
come back and face me like a man .
not good enough , sonny jim .
coming , ready or not .
hey , you !
get your hands in the air !
i don' t believe this !
even if alan gets out of this , it' il happen all over again .
when you suppress your anger , it creates negative energy .
things happen , iike ending up in the jungle , that was no accident .
whose turn is it ?
it' s my turn .
you might have told us about him .
it' s just a roii of the dice .
is he the reason you didn' t want to play ?
you didn' t want to play either ?
mr. " we" ve got to finish it " .
what' s the deai with this guy ?
he" s a hunter .
right now , he' s after me .
why ?
i don' t know .
you" d think it' d be a waste of his time .
maybe l" d iook good on his wall .
your turn .
talk it over with him .
are you crazy ?
the man has a gun .
don' t ever call me crazy !
this whole town thinks i' m crazy because of this board game .
maybe i should roll .
yeah .
no one ever came to my parties .
heilo , i' m roiling now .
i' m gonna roil .
here , just roil .
don' t be fooled , it isn' t thunder .
staying put would be a blunder .
do you hear that ?
run !
it' s a stampede !

why didn' t you grab it , peter ?
ignore him .
he' s a libra .

we can' t finish it without him .

i can' t stop them .
get the natlonal guard down here .

you wouldn' t believe me if i told you , carl .
how do you know my name ?
i know a iot more than that .
you used to work at parrish shoes .
they used to call you " sole man " .
that' s right .
i was in there . .. till old man parrish fired me .
and i had something that could' ve turned this whole town around .
your shoes .
