shadows in paradlse
friday !
take it .
i' m driving .
listen , nikander .
we' ve been a team for quite a while .
but i' ve been doing this for 25 years .
i' m getting tired , and so' s the old heart .
what' s the matter ?
never mind .
i' ve got an idea my own company .
five trucks to start with ...
where does it end ?
the sky' s the limit .
the state and the banks will back us .
i know everything about this game but i' m not going to die behind the wheel .
where , then ?
behind a desk .
and i need a good foreman .

we' il put a plaster on it .
coming out tonight ?
where ?
somewhere with some fun .

how was the weekend ?
great !
i had a hell of a time !
have you thought about it ?
everything' s ready .
the bank' s with us and we' ve got a garage .
maybe i should go on a course .
fine !
do whatever you think .
i promised my wife way back that with me , she would get to see the world ... ... it' s about time .
i can be a driver , too .
or whatever , if you think i can manage .
sure you can !
reliable garbage disposal since 1986 .
but that' s now !
that' s why it catches the eye !
pretty smart !
isn' t it .
who can put out the flame once it starts to blaze
underneath the hot , hot sun
on life' s highway you can see many pretty will o ' the wisps
but there' s only one i truly miss ...
another one .
no more !
no ?
good morning .
dammit !
my neck' s stiff .
what happened ?
i' m not at work !
where are we ?
the door' s locked .
it usually is , in jail .
i' il lose my job .
do you come here often ?
no , never .
you' re ok then .
i don' t have a job at all .

why do you think ?
we got a spare job yesterday .
maybe you could get it .
what' s your job ?
garbage truck driver .

won' t help .
she' il hit me anyway .
why drink then ?
it makes me feel good .
things seem to be fine .

yea .
how about another ?
no .
why not ?
i' il call her after it .
if it helps .
if you' ve got a problem ...

nobody .
of course not .
hello .

i' ve been wondering who takes that away .
it' s only me .

i' m working till eight .
that' s ok .
alright then .
i' il be here at eight .

i' ve got a weird migraine : gotta go .
what' s the rush ?
let' s have a drink .
i' m in a hurry .
hi .

what' s the matter with you ?
why ?
you look nervous .
bullshit !
don' t you eat around this time ?

doctor' s orders !
a barefaced lie !
admirable !

i don' t think it' il work out .
what won' t ?
anything .
morning .
how was it ?
what ! ?
104 . 95 .
you' re wanted downstairs .
no one can predict how the market forces change .
sometimes you have too much staff , sometimes too little .
but i' d have liked to keep you here with us .
sure !
but there' s nothing i can do about it .
i just sit here and watch the sales graph ...
there must be a new supermarket around here with all their special offers and so on ...
so our sales will go down temporarily .
i' m afraid you' il have to go .
the supermarket' s a merciless machine .
your daughter finishes school in two weeks .
she needs a job .
you don' t fool me .
you can stay the two weeks .
and the flat ?
two weeks .
that' s all .
i think i' il leave now .
then you lose two weeks ' salary .
thanks a lot .
that guy is crazy .
what do you mean ?
i got fired .
you did ?
yes .
why ?
just because .
oh shit .
hi .
well , hi !
let' s go .
where ?
for a drive , out of town .
what , now ?
ok .
but i must see a friend first .
why ?
that' s my business .
let' s go then .
hi .
lend me some money and a clean shirt , will you ?
ok .
give me 500 .
i haven' t got it .
you just got paid yesterday !
i paid the food bill .
damn you .
find a clean shirt , will you ?
good evening .
we saw the vacancy sign .
one double , is it ?
no , two singles .
please fill these in .
are you coming in ?
now what ...
nikander ?
i don' t know .
are you hungry ?
yes .
let' s go to a restaurant and eat .
i must change then .
ok .
change .
i' il see you in the corridor .
not bad , is it ?
it' s fine .
do you find it dull here ?
with me , i mean .
why ?
just asking .
take it easy .
everything' s ok tonight .
i don' t know about tomorrow , though .
maybe the weather will turn , or something .
what do you want from me anyway ?
who me ?
yes , you .
more wine ?
answer me !
i don' t want anything from anybody !
i' m nikander .
ex butcher , now a garbage truck driver !
bad teeth and stomach , liver hanging on !
more than i can say about my head !
no use asking what i want .
i only asked .
you' re welcome .
it' s cold here .
really ?
i hadn' t noticed .
good night .
thanks for the evening .
come in .
breakfast .
what' s that ?
supermarket' s cashbox , but it' s locked .
show me .
is there money in it ?
yes .
how much ?
how should i know ?
i can' t get it open .
wait , don' t do a thing .
all you ever gave me was sorrow and pain
but that' s alright , i can hide my ache .
i won' t let people know for if you leave me now
my heart will cry but it mustn' t show .
what shall i do with the money ?
there' s too much of it , you' il have to give it back .
it was revenge .
it' s the third job i' ve been thrown out of this year .
i wanted to go to florida but i missed the plane .
anyway , i couldn' t get the box open .
my aunt' s been to florida all she saw was some finns and donald ducks .
they must know i took it .
i' il take care of that .
that would be great .
do you know what you' re doing ?
of course .
ilona rajamki ?
if you didn' t take the money why won' t you tell us where you' ve been since you left work on saturday ?
it' s none of your business , that' s why .
you haven' t been to your flat , we have witnesses .
witnesses ?
your ex workmates .
when you were fired you left right away .
you were very upset .
a cash box disappeared .
sounds bad , doesn' t it ?
that depends .
you' re the only suspect .
shall i go through the questions again ?
don' t bother .
i ...
yes ?
what do you want me to say ?
don' t say anything .
say that i went back where i came from .
i thought you were a local .
no .
where' re you from , then ?
down the street .
i' il say you just took off .
fine .
see you .
how much for a single ?
300 marks , with breakfast .
and without ?
the same .
i' il take it .
no way .
why ?
we' re full .
why didn' t you say so ?
is ilona there ?
no .
she should be !
yes , but she left .
where ?
she didn' t say .
i see .
so long .
we' re closing .
i must go to work .
i' il stay here and sleep .
here are some sheets and a towel .
right .
i must go .
it' s beautiful .

the sun , the sea and the birds .
gimme a light .

guess where she is now ?
no .
sleeping in my bed .

horror , fear and this work shift .
i' il take care of things .

when will you pay me back ?
i' il get liver pt tomorrow .
go ahead .
thanks .
mother in law' s babysitting tonight .

if you' ve got a bad conscience , i can' t help .
why should i have ?
how should i know ?
maybe you just got lost , maybe not !
i' il go in the morning .

but we' ve still gotta collect the shit .
no way .
i' il make you some coffee .

you' il get fired without a doctor' s certificate .
the kind of doctor i need hasn' t been born yet .
are you coming ?
are you still seeing that dustman ?
no .
he was a bit ugly , anyway .
what do you mean ?
he wasn' t .
really ugly .
but nice .
maybe a bit strange .
at least he wasn' t as dumb as your men .
they can' t even chew gum and walk at the same time .
but nikander can ?
a lot of other things , too .
but it' s too late now .
three sixes .
why do i keep losing ?
you' ve got no desire to win .
so what ?
you' ve got a kid .
that' s right .
how does it feel ?
it' s ok .
want me to smash you face in ?
who , you ?
no .
that' s what i thought .
why ?
why not ?
want to buy a video recorder ?
i' ve got one .
i can sell you one .
i don' t need another one !

my wife' s in there , with the washing machine .
she could watch it while she' s cooking .
are you out of your mind or something ?
i don' t think so .
want to go out for a beer tonight ?
can' t , the wife' s going .
they always do .
three twos .
i was pretty well through with the subject .
i' d probably considered it from most of its various angles including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious with the person possessing them .
it' s funny .
it' s very funny .
and it' s a lot of fun , too , to be in love .
do you think so ?
it' s funny .
it' s very funny .
and it' s a lot ...

my poor heart longs for you
it' s beating here all alone .
so hurry , please , oh , hurry home
man' s life is oh so short .
hurry to me , my love , my own
you give me everything .
hurry , please , hurry to me
everything here is yours .
but my friend , although i ask
i know it' s all in vain .
even though i long for you
day and night , don' t run to me .
don' t , because you know it too
life would only bring us pain .
don' t hurry now back to me
the shadows here would swallow you .
hurry not , see the beautiful world
because here you wouldn' t see for tears .
