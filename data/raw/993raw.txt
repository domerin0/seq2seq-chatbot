this guy has officially become a pain in the ass .
they' re both gonna drown !
what do you want ?

to god .
you' re not god !
not even close .
not much of a swimmer either , really .
i' il go .

jemi ... !
it' s so dangerous .
i was gonna go in there and then i had to get the towels .
there were three .
wendy , you' re really wet .
there you go .
you poor thing .
why did you do that ?
it' s my job at the post office .
we don' t like citizens in the water .
makes it hard to deliver mail .
why did you do that ?
ok .
my wife died last christmas .
all my friends are dead .
anybody i can talk to is dead .
i wanted to be with my ann and my friends .
you stopped me .
why ?
maybe the reward is in the caring .
you don' t even know me !
so you' il do this again tomorrow ?
probably , yeah .
we only do rescues on our day off .
he' s kidding .
of course we' il rescue you .
but could you give us an idea of the time ?
no !
that' s good .
you can spend the rest of the day not butting into other people' s business .
he lost his wife and friends .
that' s so depressing .
did i tell you i was a recovering workaholic ?
rebecca , more towels .
ok .
if you were going to kill yourself , why write to god ?
why not just do it ?
there is nothing wrong with people choreographing their own ending .
a lot of people do it .
even more people think about it .
didn' t you ever think about it ?
well , i guess i' m just curious to see how the hand plays out .
i' m 74 years old !
i don' t have time for another hand to be dealt .
maybe you need to meet someone .
sure .
who would date me ?
i got brown spots all over .
i got a voice like a loud snore .
i got a lot of hair in my ears .
sure , who' s gonna date me ?
maybe a blind woman .
if we' re gonna keep the ball rolling , we thought we' d better come up with a system .
mr dooly ?
hats ?
i get headaches .
i can' t wear hats .
to people coming in , it looks like hats , but wait till you see this .
got ' em all categorised , people .
bin a , these are people' s needs .
things , someone , food , love , a break .
bin b , places and what they need ...
dear god , my sister and i are nurses at a retirement home .
we read an article that said single people live longer when they have a pet to love and care for . " dooly , listen !
we' ve got the senior single people .
can you supply the pets ?
thank you , lori and terri nathan .
hi , how are you ?
darwin !
he needs a home .
this is darwin .
best dog of the lot .

no , mr raskin is allergic to cats .
he can' t have cats .
he ought to have a medical sign .
forget that , go get mr raskin !
tom .
excuse me .
dooly !
dooly , are you completely psychotic ?
dear god ...
well , i' ve got the twins , lilly and charlotte .
i thank you for them .
but i didn' t know it would be such a job raising them !
there' s feeding , rocking , cleaning .
it' s day and night , 24 hours .
my husband , kenny , works nights , my in laws live in alaska and my parents haven' t spoken to me since i married kenny .
please , i need a break .
just one night to relax .
thank you , crystal fricker .
dear god , i' ve tried to maintain our home , my kids and my work since alex died .
you' ve always answered my prayers .
thank you .
i have a steady job and happy , healthy kids .
but when i get home from cleaning at the hotel
i don' t have the energy to do it again in my own home .
please give me strength and patience with the kids when they make messes and cause more work for me at home .
so , this the big date ?
there' s no date .
sarah gave me the afternoon off , so i figured i' d test out some new recipes on him .
if sylvia plath were alive today
she' d put her head in a microwave oven
i' il do that one tonight .
ok .
tom and i are going out but rebecca will take you next door .
you can play as many video games as you like then she' il take you home .
we' il have a good time , won' t we ?
yes .
ok .
this isn' t a ...
i know .
well , it' s a beautiful day today , so you two have a lot of fun .
is she gonna do that all day ?
ok , here come the videos .
let' s go .
charles , i owe you .
yeah .
it' s ok , tommy .
just clean up after yourselves .
you got about an hour .
how do you know that guy ?
gave him a tip on a horse .
and he still let us in .
you' re confusing me .
why ?
we both know that you' re a screw up , but lately ...
gloria , trust me , you can' t trust me .
that' s what i thought .
i believe you .
thank you very much .
what did i promise you ?
a concert , a picnic and a dance .
and that , my dear , is exactly what you shall have .
so what about your father ?
i' ve only heard you talk about your mom .
my dad couldn' t cut it as a golfer so he became a golf hustler , i guess .
this is my place .
celebrity apartments ?
yeah .
do celebrities live here ?
yeah .
none that you' d actually know , but a lot of international stars .
huge honduran contingent .
you' re not coming , are you ?
tell me more about your father .
we' ve done this .
he' s a golfer .
you told me your dad' s a mortician .
i didn' t laugh .
we talked about indiana , new jersey .
i believe we' re to the awkward groping part .
yeah , but you said , " i guess " .
so where' s your dad ?
i don' t know .
where is he ?
well , when i was a kid , one morning , very early ,
i heard a noise downstairs .
it was my dad .
he was standing there , and he told me to close my eyes .
i thought he had some sort of a surprise for me .
when i opened them ... ... he was gone .
i never closed my eyes again .
sorry you asked , right ?
and you never heard from him ?
no , i never did .
it' s still early .
you should check the place out .
you' il feel so much better about your own place .
i think i' d like to feel awkward in private .
just for a few minutes , though .
it' s right here .
it might be on the messy side .
i' m sure it' s fine .
more company , tom ?
i won' t tell the enquirer .
thanks , otis .
i won' t tell unsolved mysteries about you .
tom !
somebody really trashed the place .
the fish are ok .
who' s junior ?
someone determined to ruin our evening .
i' m sorry .
it' s just stuff .
yeah , well , it' s the only stuff i own .
possessions are chains .
a free man owns nothing .
you don' t really believe that .
you want me to say you don' t have a pot to piss in ?
like they say , no good deed goes unpunished .
would you mail this for me ?
word is , you have a lot of pull with the man .
god , the big guy in the sky .
would you ?
we' il take care of it .
thank you .
i gotta get some breakfast .
why would they break my eggs ?
it makes no sense .
don' t we know each other ?
i don' t think so .
i' m here a lot .
i love this neighbourhood .
i love the ambience , the milieu .
dear god , my horn is in hock .
the pawn shop will only hold it a few more days .
i' m desperate for a horn .
any horn .
i need to play !
randy sky tyler .
here are today' s announcements .
all the clerks selling elvis stamps are not permitted to dress like him .
no , not there !
throw it here .
like me .
you ?
like that ?
no , not at me !
like me .
you like me ?
no .
get away !
no , no .
like me .
i don' t see why you can' t do your nails at the end of the day .
tom , you just don' t understand nails .
changing shift .
you had some visitors again .
alright , everybody , let' s macarena .
come on up , i' m having a party .
dear god , a friend of ours was burglarised last night .
he doesn' t deserve much , but what the hell , it' s christmas .
whatever you find for him has to be better than his old stuff , which he is better off without .
signed , everyone but tom .
our letters are getting to god and , for that , i am very grateful .
they are getting to god faster than they' re getting to my sister .
coupled with an article in today' s " el peridico " about this girl and her letter to god , some are calling it the case of the postal miracles .
this is andr james signing off .
yo , cowboy , take it easy !
it was junior' s idea to trash this place .
dude !
are you boffing the cleaning lady or something ?
nice pad !
hurry up and beat me up , webster .
i gotta get some sleep .
food , dude !
listen , man , there ain' t gonna be any beating .
junior' s dead .
he' s dead ?
i can' t believe it .
heart attack , right ?
i knew he needed to lose a few pounds .
nope .
got hit by a bus .
did a lot of damage to the front end .
so , happy holidays !
don' t mess with my head .
so , what ?
i' m off the hook now ?
i' m officially debt free ?
right .
but first things first .
tonight , you and me are gonna make party like old times !
wait .
get your own .
this is my chaser .
that is , if you can still party .
i heard you and some postal buddies have been doing some good deeds .
you are kidding , right ?
this is my greatest hustle of all time , webster .
eventually , people will send money through the mail ,
i' il take the money out , pay off whoever you work for , and you can get your boots off of lucille' s blanket .
tom !
i brought in a horn .
don' t tell me .
we' re gonna start the dlo marching band ?
no , it' s for randy , the homeless guy .
i got a problem .
he can' t know where it came from .
he' s too proud .
make a fake notice of delivery slip .
he can pick it up himself .
perfect .
you' re starting to participate .
no , just helping a fellow musician .
i' m emanda maine at the central post office as crowds gather for some sign of a miracle in their lives .
doug diamond at la post office with people in search of miracles .
people of all shapes and sizes .
police feel it could turn into a logistical nightmare .
can we go again ?
i have a hair issue .
as a retired juggling motorbike hoodlum , what are you praying for ?
i need a new hog .
stories of hope .
this one is from a homeless guy living on ocean avenue .
he says they really need food , boxes and cans this christmas .
13 days till christmas and the holiday spirit is engulfing la .
emanda maine has the update .
emanda ?
among the usual holiday scenes , a wave of kindness is going on .
for instance , a salvation army post was robbed .
people heard about it from the post office and contributed toys to make up for the stolen ones .
a leaflet told santa monica homeless people
santa claus would bring canned food .
nobody thought santa would be coming but ...
he is coming !
i' m barbara beck .
good evening .
dear god , i am young , gifted and latino , but the people on the soap operas , don' t think i could play a wasp hunk opposite susan lucci .
dear god , i need a jet black turbo saab 900 .
of course you do , sir !
poor guy .
put him at the top of the list .
rebecca' s rocking .
dear god , i am sorry for my sins .
i have had my faith restored these last few weeks .
in honour of my patron saint , paul , please accept this $5, 000 to use as you please .
cash ?
$5, 000 ?
that could do somebody a lot of good .
5, 000 ?
nobody ever sent that before !
let' s add it to the 82 cents in the dlo fund .
tom , tell us what we do with it .
you be in charge of the money .
so ?
let me think about this .
attention , everybody .
be careful .
some nut outside is baptising our postal people on the head .
put it back .
all of it .
turn it in to the financial office ?
if that' s what you do .
the man' s an angel .
this is the second time i' ve seen him return money .
tom turner cannot be bought !
it' s a setup .
they want to charge us with stealing cash from the mail .
a federal offence .
of course !
you' re an extraordinarily paranoid guy .
i like that !
it' s a madhouse out there !
pushing , shoving , squeezing !
i had a little fun !
mucho ms mail for dear god .
tom , what do we do now ?
now ?
now we hang low for a while .
see what they do if all this stops .
you think if you guys stop , the letters will stop ?
we just got started here .
we got all the bins organised and everything .
ok , so we' re clear ?
low profile .
try not to do anything nice for a few days .
i was beginning to care .
you know , when you care , you' re kind of rewarded for that .
with us tonight is preston sweeny , us postmaster general .
i' m sitting here in washington dc , very upset .
you don' t think god is really answering these letters ?
i don' t think so .
we have many rules in the postal business .
but we have one ironclad rule .
you cannot open someone else' s mail .
doesn' t matter who it' s addressed to .
elvis , god , the easter bunny .
you , barbara .
you can' t open other people' s mail .
that' s the rule .
i vow we will find these people and we will put them in jail !
thank you , mr sweeny .
this is barbara beck saying goodnight .
thanks for helping with his homework .
he' s better at math than i am .
it' s frightening .
ok , so clue me in .
are you going to jail ?
you afraid you' il have to dress in black and pine away in front of the prison ?
no , i just don' t know how to bake a file into a bran muffin .
i see .
but it' s safe to say that you were maybe thinking about it .
you can never tell .
you were considering it .
i saw that !
yes .
ok , say goodbye .
bye .
thanks for doing my homework .
see you , buddy .
good luck tomorrow .
yeah .
i saw that , too !
in front of the post office , a frenzied make me a miracle crowd is being fired up by the 90 degree holiday heat wave in los angeles .
it was not me .
i swear on the bible .
did you guys know we was on tv ?
they said we did 14 postal miracles since friday .
we' re getting credit for miracles we didn' t do .
what is going on ?
don' t you get it ?
no .
well , they do .
faith , thomas .
faith .
people are helping people .
regular people are doing miracles all by themselves .
and you started it .
you should be proud .
congratulations .
let' s get to work .
nice job , guys !
way to go !
thanks , tom !
postal police !
everybody , freeze !
i am not illegal .
i am puerto rican .
that' s him .
but there must be a mistake .
no , that' s the guy .
eye dris abraham ?
idris .
idris abraham , you' re under arrest .
cuff him good .
put him in the car .
this is big mistake .
we fix .
guy , what ... ?
this is great .
like being on cops .
why are you ... ?
how about that guy ?
ten days left to his pension and he screws up .
he forged a notice of delivery slip and we nailed him .
everybody , come , go back to work .
back !
father ?
wait , i remember you .
you' re the beeper man .
you walked out on my sermon about thomas .
you remember that ?
yeah .
comedians and priests , we never forget a walkout .
while i' m here , out of curiosity , how did that sermon on doubting thomas end ?
well , you know , thomas found his belief again .
then , according to the version i like ,
thomas became a wealthy architect .
he moves to india , he meets this king , who gives him a ton of cash and says ,
build me a grand palace .
that' s it ?
the end ?
he spent every rupee of the king' s fortune feeding the poor .
when the king found out ...
he killed him .
sent his goons in .
no .
thomas told him , " instead of a palace on earth ,
i' ve built you a palace in heaven .
and then he killed him .
i got it .
thank you .
can you hold this , please ?
well , look , the king let thomas go and thomas spent the rest of his happy life sacrificing for others .
so thomas conned the king , right ?
no .
no , the king was not conned .
the king had faith .
he believed .
see , that' s where i get confused .
that' s good .
confusion is good .
faith isn' t arrived at easily .
it' s the struggle that gives it its power and its meaning .
you still struggling ?
every day .
yeah .
when times are particularly trying ,
i try to act as if everything is as it should be , the way god intends it .
and then , eventually , i get my faith back .
what if you never had it to begin with ?
that' s a big one , isn' t it ?
i can' t believe i' m doing this .
my name is rebecca .
i' m pretending i remember how to be a lawyer , which i don' t .
do they have anything on us ?
i mean , him ?
a trumpet .
some homeless musician got a horn from god .
they traced it back to idris , who' s charged with tampering with the mail .
he' il probably plea bargain and throw our bodies on the spears !
ratfink !
no .
you didn' t hear ?
no , he confessed .
confessed to what ?
he didn' t do anything .
they told him if he pleaded guilty , they' d drop the whole investigation .
but he' s the only one not guilty .
i should not be saying this , but it doesn' t exactly feel right to let him take the rap alone .
i feel ok .
i don' t know what good it' d do for us to turn ourselves in .
now , tom , what do you think ?
i think ...
... i should have gone to jail in the first place .
i' d have met a better class of people there .
a study shows that approximately 55 percent continue to believe in a thing called miracles .
faith is a natural response .
it is cynicism we learn .
wait , we have a breaking news story .
let' s go to the la post office .
this is tom turner , a postal worker , with some new information on the god squad case .
mr turner ?
yeah , they arrested the wrong man .
idris abraham was a scapegoat .
really ?
he wasn' t involved in any of this .
and how do you know this ?
because i did it all .
excuse me ?
i did it all .
it was me .
i did everything .
i' ve got another client .
as we approach christmas , the case of the so called postal miracles takes another strange turn .
previously arrested idris abraham has been set free and given his pension , while postal worker tom turner has confessed and been charged with answering god' s mail without authorisation .
the postal miracle trial has taken a holiday high speed lane through the overloaded court docket .
having dispensed with the arraignment , we are ready for trial .
and the whole country is watching as the post office miracle workers take on the us government in a modern day david versus goliath .
legal experts predict that , in this case , goliath will win .
i agreed to let you broadcast from here but you gotta work or i' il get fired .
pick up a brush .
grab the putty !
i' m here for you .
i meant to keep you guys outta here , so you could continue your work .
i' m sorry .
mr bacon ?
this court is now in session .
judge kits van heynigan presiding .
stuart banks , for the prosecution .
for the defence , rebecca frazen .
excuse me .
pardon me .
excuse me .
stuart !
hi .
when did you get out of the rubber bungalow ?
good to see you .
gentlemen .
he knows you ?
i used to live with him , in another life .
a total sociopath .
not a problem .
your honour , we are prepared today to charge one mr tom turner with several counts of tampering , impersonating a federal employee and theft of government property .
does the defence have an opening statement ?
not at this time .
i guess we never thought about who tom was , or his people , or how god had contacted them .
i thought he was a nice man , that tom turner .
so you turned to tom turner ?
well , no .
i turned to god .
what he did was very nice , but i don' t know if what he did was right .
thank you .
no more questions , your honour .
the prosecution rests .
ok , give it to me straight .
worst case scenario .
one to five years for every count , or every miracle .
12 miracles .
you could get 60 years .
we' il adjourn until 1 pm .
lunch .
i gotta go .
can i have my son back now ?
i' m outside the la federal court , where lawyers for the prosecution and defence are locked in contentious legal debate over the origins , motives and parties responsible in the so called postal miracle trial .
i' ve dealt with some of these attorneys .
people , i' ve been to boxing matches that are more civilised .
you may be seated .
mr turner .
are there any witnesses for the defence ?
witnesses ?
i don' t even know where my lawyer is .
we' re here .
we' re here , your honour .
we' re all here .
i was basically the ringleader .
el nmero uno .
el hombre con los manos de piedra .
i' m the one you' re looking for .
he was a pawn in the chess game of life .
why would a con like tom turner do good deeds ?
think about it .
did you talk them into this ?
no .
they all wanted to do it .
do you have to type while i' m talking ?
it was !
it was thursday .
i threatened tom .
i said , " either get in on this or i' il bite out your spleen !
mr dooly , do you really expect us to believe you' re the enforcer type ?
yeah .
you got a problem with that , bobbing head ?
wanna see ?
wanna see me enforce something ?
i' d like to enforce you .
let' s take it outside !
come on , let' s go !
i want this man removed from my courtroom .
take him out .
i' il get you , you legal lump of lard !
lighten up here .
you come down to the post office for stamps , you' il be in line a week .
now , mr vidov , if you would give us your impression of the defendant ...
i' ve lost the witness , your honour .
no , right here .
i lost pipe .
i' m trying to stop smoking .
i' m nervous .
there' s no smoking in the courtroom .
no ?
ok .
now , if you would give us your impression of mr tom turner .
see , i do believe that god may or may not live in heaven ...
and you' re going to heaven ?
i believe in russian proverb .
it says , you go to heaven for weather and hell for the company .
may i finish , please ?
knock yourself out .
i do believe that god also lives within each of us .
is this going somewhere ?
perhaps he does not live within lawyers .
but i believe that god was speaking through tom .
tom turner made ordinary people do extraordinary things .
we need this .
as his supervisor , i covered up for him .
therefore , i am as guilty as him .
ok .
enough .
fine .
is there anybody else here who would like to confess ?
is there anybody else here that the defence would like to blame ?
maybe society at large ?
maybe the media ?
maybe , i don' t know , lex luthor .
maybe sacco and vanzetti .
maybe hannibal lecter .
maybe the one armed man .
what the hell is going on ?
now that i have your attention , mr banks , please proceed with a little more decorum , rather than this childish display of histrionics .
yes , judge kits van heynigan .
the prosecution is finished with its cross examination .
it is so obvious this whole performance is just to impress me .
put your arm around me .
what ?
put your arm around me .
does the defence rest ?
rebecca ?
yes .
defence rests .
in that case , your honour , the prosecution is ready to begin its summation .
after a five minute recess .
this may be the first time a serial killer has actually killed with poisoned cereal .
no one knows the motive .
and we have a bulletin in the who' s answering god' s mail case .
that' s right , barbara .
experts are even more certain that the prosecution' s case will prevail .
it' s defence attorney rebecca frazen' s first time in the courtroom since leaving the legal profession two years ago for unknown reasons .
rumour has it she appeared at a deposition for an animal rights case totally nude .
will you stop the shaking ?
i' m trying to listen !
the government wishes to keep its focus on mr tom turner , despite the multitude of sins confessed to by his co workers .
now , what do these co workers have in common ?
all of them have worked at the post office for years without ever committing a crime .
that' s a good point .
shut up !
the defendant , however , a man with a dubious character , arrived a month and a half ago , at precisely the same time that these so called miracles began to occur .
he broke the law and he directed others to break the law .
but worst of all , he literally chose to play god , to who knows how many hundreds of good and faithful people .
and what of the countless others who write to god every day ?
there must be accountability here .
there must be a reckoning .
this is no petty misdemeanour , your honour .
this is hurtful and cruel fraud .
the government demands the maximum fine and imprisonment .
i know , tom .
i was the one that got you into this and i' m gonna figure out something tonight .
and i' m gonna get you out .
thanks .
we' il adjourn until nine tomorrow morning .
i just want you to know
joey and i think you did the right thing and we' re proud of you .
ps , i included something to make you smile .
here we are .
i didn' t know rebecca had dogs .
dogs ?
your honour , these are my witnesses for my closing argument .
alright , proceed .
thank you , your honour .
let me take you back , back millions of years ago , when the earth spewed forth many different species from its molten loins .
some species stayed in their microscopic state , others moved on .
no matter how far they developed , they all retained one common characteristic which i will demonstrate for you now .
your honour , this is rocky .
and rocky is a healthy little doggie , aren' t you , sugars ?
and that is his friend , taffy .
and taffy' s been a sick puppy all week .
now , taffy needs some nourishment , and in my pocket i have a little doggie treat , which i am going to set between these two old friends .
now , healthy doggy rocky cares about his poor sick friend taffy , but he still quickly gobbled up the treat .
gobbled it up !
because rocky acted only on instinct and not feelings .
because that is what animals do , your honour .
you big thing , you !
but human beings , human beings are able to help their friends , because human beings can recognise when their friends are sick , or our friends are happy , or our friends are ... sad .
now , yes , maybe tom turner did do some of those things that the learned prosecutor , who sucks his thumb in his sleep , says that he did .
but tom turner didn' t do these things for himself .
tom turner did these things for other people .
can the dogs leave now , before there' s an accident ?
ok , everybody up .
rocky and taffy may step down .
mayday !
mayday !
we all know what tom turner did .
what we don' t know is why he did it .
things aren' t going well .
i need all the help i can get .
would you like to know why ?
i' d like to know .
i need sorters , carriers , drivers .
speaking on his own behalf , may tom turner finish my closing argument ?
roll the trucks .
you didn' t prep me on this .
just tell them the truth , or ... make something up .
proceed .
i want to celebrate christmas before it' s new year' s .
she' s making tom speak ?
yeah .
thank you , judge kits van ...
heineken .
i can' t pronounce your name .
then call me shirley .
but let' s get this thing moving along .
i don' t have any dogs with me and i' m not a very good dancer .
i can only tell you my thoughts .
i lay awake most of last night , wondering how i ended up here .
about how i' ve spent my life playing people for fools .
and these losers ' letters to god gave you a sudden change of heart ?
they didn' t .
when i first saw them , i thought these people were saps .
if i could have taken advantage of them , i would have .
but they didn' t have anything to take , except their faith .
and i didn' t even know what that was .
i mean , how could people , especially people dealt such crummy , pathetic hands , have faith in anything or anyone ?
i don' t know how things got going , but it' s not because i had some sort of noble intention .
if anything , it' s because i met somebody who saw right through me .
i wanted her to think i was a better person than we both knew me to be .
she' s not here right now .
her name is gloria .
she had to work .
as many do , i' ve discovered .
window .
mr bacon , will you please see to it that all of the windows are tightly closed ?
yeah , tom !
proceed , young man .
well , that' s pretty much it .
i mean , the letters kept pouring in and i began to believe .
to believe that i could really help people and that that was more rewarding than any con that i could pull .
and then i found , this is the really bizarre thing , the less i tried to take advantage of people , the more i got back .
your honour , i lost my programme notes .
is this where we all clap for tinker bell ?
you' re blessed with a con artist' s gift of talking his way out of trouble .
that didn' t sound like a compliment .
so how do i know if your words are sincere or if they' re some cynical attempt to talk your way out of trouble ?
i don' t know .
i appreciate your candour , mr turner .
and i hope that you can appreciate ...
would somebody please tell me what is going on out there ?
the federal courthouse is surrounded by what appears to be every mail truck in the southland .
outside the federal courthouse , traffic is at a standstill .
tom in jail , no mail .
your honour , you' re gonna have to see it to believe it .
there must be 1, 000 postal trucks out there .
that' s a damn miracle .
let go of me .
i am postmaster general preston sweeny .
sure !
i' m shaquille o' neal , this is michael jordan , but you still can' t go in .
i flew in from washington .
i left a party to come here .
he is the postmaster general !
sorry .
thank you very much .
i' il remember you .
let go of me !
mr sweeny , let' s have a photograph !
we met at your daughter' s wedding .
she' s divorced .
it' s the day before christmas , i got 30 million pieces of mail backed up .
fruitcakes are rotting all over this country .
do something .
don' t tell me what to do .
tom turner , the defendant .
my client might plead no contest to one count of unauthorised ...
miracle doings .
are you nuts ?
forget it !
since he passed his postal exam ,
i move that all charges be now erased from his record .
free tom t !
they seem to like tom , your honour .
the mail must be delivered .
please .
with the proviso that the defendant complete a year of employment , as was previously ordered by the lower court , this court finds the defendant , tom turner , not guilty .
tom turner , the rocky balboa of the judicial system , has scored a knockout .
acquittal .
tom turner , not guilty , as in innocent .
as in , he needed a miracle and he got one .
i was wrong about you .
yes , you were .
thanks , rebecca .
i' il see you at work .
you missed my speech .
way to go .
i gotta see my buddy , the postmaster general .
it was a piece of cake .
i think i might go to law school .
the verdict is in .
not guilty .
you didn' t even write a dear god letter !
mr turner , if you don' t come out here and wave , there' il be a riot .
by the way , you won the bet .
steep odds .
you bet the bailiff on the verdict ?
just a silly side bet .
there' s joey .
hi , mom .
there' s my mom .
where ?
he' s got a girl with him .
really ?
yeah .
close your eyes .
take a chance , tom .
see ?
so the trial of tom turner ended but the effects of the god squad linger through the holiday season and , hopefully , even longer .
a side note .
herman dooly got his old route back and returned to the neighbourhood which had cost him his job .

herman , how are you doing ?

welcome back .
good to see you .

hi , wallace .
i' m sorry that i bit you in the knee .
i was just under a lot of pressure at the time .
it seemed like the thing to do .
you were barking , too .
so it was kind of ...
i don' t want to lay no blame or nothing .
anyway , i' m sorry .
see you around , pal .
happy holidays , wallace !
mrs morgan , got those cookies with the raisins ?
