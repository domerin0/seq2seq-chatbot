it' s the only way he can follow us .
what if it' s not who you think it is ?
it' s them .
it' s treadstone .
jason , don' t do it .
look , marie , i warned ' em .
i don' t want you to do it .
i told them what would happen if they didn' t leave us alone .
it' s never gonna be over like this .
i don' t want ...
we don' t have a choice .
yes , you do .
thank you .
two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines , and one of them failed .
the fingerprints from the one that didn' t go off .
and the germans can' t match it ?
no .
nobody' s got it .
we checked out every database we could access .
but we' re hooked into langley now .
run it .
okay .
what the hell' s treadstone ?
all right .
get me a flight .
we' re going to langley .
two men dead , three million in cash gone , no neski files , and all very public .
this is still a clandestine agency , no ?
i don' t view this event as a failure .
you call it a success ?
we have a lead .
a fingerprint left by the assassin .
he' s one of us .
who is it ?
what can you tell me about treadstone ?
treadstone ?
it' s where the trail dead ends .
if you want an answer , you' re going to have to give me ... a level five s. c. i. access .
we have a lead , marty .
all right .
you' ve got your clearance .
but you' re on a very short leash .
and you' il give a full report to the group .
i wanna know where you' re going with this .
sir .
ward ?
yes ?
pamela landy .
hey , pam .
what can i do for you ?
i was hoping you had some time for me .
time for what ?
i' m free right now , actually .
that sounds ominous .
let me check my schedule .
excuse me .
i need to , uh ...
excuse me .
can i help you ?
yeah , i' m here to see mr. abbott .
twenty minutes ?
see ya .
operation treadstone .
never heard of it .
that' s not gonna fly .
with all due respect , pam , i think you might' ve wandered past your pay grade .
that' s a warrant from director marshall granting me unrestricted access to ... all personnel and materials associated with treadstone .
so , what are we looking at ?
i wanna know about it .
know about it ?
it was a kill squad .
black on black .
we closed it down two years ago .
nobody wants to know about treadstone .
not around here .
so i think you better take this back to marty and let him know exactly what you' re doing .
he does .
i' ve been down to the archives .
i have the files , ward .
let' s talk about conklin .
what are you after , pam ?
you wanna fry me ?
you want my desk .
is that it ?
i wanna know what happened .
what happened ?
jason bourne happened .
you got the files .
then let' s cut the crap .
conklin had these guys wound so tight , they were bound to snap .
bourne was his number one .
the guy went for a job , screwed the op , never came back .
conklin couldn' t fix it , couldn' t find bourne , couldn' t adjust .
it all went sideways .
so you had conklin killed ?
i mean , if we' re cutting the crap .
i' ve given 30 years and two marriages to this agency .
i' ve shoveled shit on four continents .
i' m due to retire next year .
but if you think i' m gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this , you can go to hell ... and marshall too .
it had to be done .
and bourne ?
where is he now ?
dead in a ditch .
drunk in a bar in mogadishu .
who knows ?
i think i do .
i had a deal going down in berlin last week .
during the buy , both our case officer and the seller were killed .
they were killed byjason bourne .
they' re ready for us upstairs .
seven years ago , $20 million of c. i. a. funds disappeared during a wire transfer through moscow .
in the investigation that followed , we were contacted by a russian politician , vladimir neski .
neski claimed we had a leak and that we' d been ripped off by one of our own .
and were we ?
we never found out .
we were negotiating a meet with mr. neski when he was killed .
by who ?
his wife .
the case had gone cold until a month ago when we found a source .
another russian in berlin who claimed to have access to the neski murder files .
we thought we had another bite at the apple .
turns out the assassin was one of our own ... jason bourne .
i know treadstone' s not a very popular subject around here , but we found some interesting things when we dug a little deeper .
this is conklin' s personal computer .
his treadstone files are bloated with code keys and case files that he neither needed nor had clearance for .
buried in the hard drive , we found a deleted file with an account number to a bank in zurich .
at the time ofhis death , he was sitting on a personal account in the amount of $ 760, 000 .
you know what his budget was ?
we were throwing money at him and asking him to keep it dark .
it was his own account .
he was up to something .
this is supposed to be definitive ?
what' s definitive is that i just lost two people in berlin .
so what' s your theory ?
conklin' s reaching out from the grave to protect his good name ?
the man is dead .
no one' s disputing that , ward .
for christ' s sake , marty , you knew conklin .
does this scan ?
i mean , at all ?
cut to the chase , pam .
i think that bourne and conklin were in business together , that bourne' s still involved and that whatever information i was trying to buy in berlin ... was big enough to bring bourne out from hiding to kill again .
how' s that scan ?
excuse me , sir , but you' re not gonna believe this .
jason bourne' s passport just popped up on the grid in naples .
okay .
contact naples .
they need to know who they' re dealing with .
find out what kind of local assets we have in place there .
nah , it' s nothing .
some guy' s name came up on the computer .
yeah .
hey , listen , tom , i' m gonna call you back , okay ?
all right .
mr. bourne , i' m john nevins .
i' m with the u. s. consulate .
i just have a few questions for you .
you' re coming out oftangier .
is that correct ?
what' s the , uh , nature of your visit to naples ?
look , i don' t know what you did , and i don' t know who you' re working for .
but i promise you this ... you' re gonna play ball one way or the other .
this is nevins .
this is tom cronin , c. i. operations officer calling from langley , virginia .
do you have a jason bourne in custody ?
yes , i do .
listen , he' s an agency priority target .
call me back as soon as he' s secure .
i understand .
he' s been detained .
here' s the number .
he' s being interrogated by a field officer out of the consulate .
hello .
this is pamela landy , c. i. supervisor .
where do we stand ?
i , uh , think he got away .
damn it .
have you locked down the area ?
locked it down ?
no .
no .
this is , uh ...
this is italy .
they don' t exactly lock down ...
how long have you worked for the agency ?
me ?
for four years .
if you ever wanna make it to five , you' re gonna listen to me real close .
bourne is armed and extremely dangerous .
last week in berlin he assassinated two men ... one a highly experienced field officer .
i want you to secure that area .
i want any evidence secured , and i want it done right now .
is that clear ?
yes , sir ... ma' am .
i' m getting on a plane to berlin in 45 minutes , which means you' re gonna call me back in 30 .
and when i ask you where we stand , i had better be impressed .
berlin ?
i already have a team in place there .
i doubt that bourne' s in naples ready to start a family .
you have no idea what you' re getting into .
do you have any idea ?
from the minute he left treadstone , he' s killed and eluded every single person that you' ve sent to find him .
you read a couple of files on jason bourne , and that makes you an expert ?
this is my case , ward .
enough .
i want you both on that plane .
we are , all of us , going to do what we were either too lazy or inept to do the last time around .
we' re gonna find this son of a bitch and take him down .
i' m not having jason bourne destroy any more of this agency .
is that definitive enough for you ?
yes .
jason bourne is armed and extremely dangerous .
last week in berlin he assassinated two men ... one a highly experienced field officer .
i want that area ...
... he assassinated two men ... one a highly experienced field officer .
i want that area secured .
i want any evidence secured , and i want it done right now ...
this is not a drill , soldier .
this is not a drill , soldier .
this is not a drill , soldier .
we clear on that ?
we clear on that ?
you' d been working at treadstone for three years , and your cover at the time was what ?
that i was an american student in paris .
and what exactly did your job with treadstone in paris consist of ?
i had two responsibilities .
one was to coordinate logistical operations .
the other was to monitor the health of the agents .
health , meaning what ?
their mental health .
because of what they had been through , they were prone to a variety of problems .
what kind ?
depression , anger , compulsive behaviors .
they had physical symptoms .
headaches , sensitivity to light .
amnesia ?
before bourne ?
no .
the plane' s ready .
there' s a car waiting for you .
good luck .
no .
you were his local contact .
you were with him the night conklin died .
you' re coming with us .
langley pulled an image out of naples .
it' s uploading right now .
it' s coming in now .
i need clearance .
he' s not hiding , that' s for sure .
why naples ?
why now ?
could be random .
maybe he' s running .
on his own passport ?
what is he actually doing ?
he' s making his first mistake .
it' s not a mistake .
they don' t make mistakes .
they don' t do random .
there' s always an objective .
always a target .
the objective and targets always came from us .
who' s giving them to him now ?
scary version ?
he is .
i emptied it .
it felt a little light .
put it down .
front .
sorry .
old habits .
use your teeth .
ah .
word in the ether was you' d lost your memory .
you still should' ve moved .
what do you want ?
conklin .
he' s dead .
shot dead in paris .
dead the night you walked out .
so who' s running treadstone now ?
nobody .
they shut it down .
it' s over .
we' re the last two .
if it' s over , then why are they still after me ?
i don' t know .
ever heard the name pamela landy ?
i don' t know who that is .
pamela landy and berlin .
what' s going on in berlin ?
i don' t know .
why would i lie ?
i thought you were here to kill me .
what' d you do ?
i' m sorry .
did you call it in ?
get up .
come on .
you have a car out front ?
the keys are in my coat pocket .
but we should ...
what ?
go out the back .
i have another car .
pamela landy .
nein , mein herr .
danke .
pamela landy .
nein .
pamela landy , bitte .
ja .
pamela landy , please .
one moment , please .
thank you .
i wanted to call a guest .
pamela landy .
just one second , please .
hello ?
hello ?
i' m sorry , sir .
the phone' s busy right now .
just try later .
thank you .
okay .
let' s take a look at the timeline .
what' s bourne' s objective ?
now , i wanna break this out in boxes .
naples outbound .
check everything .
flights , trains , police reports .
that' s box one .
teddy , that' s yours .
got it .
box number two .
call it ' prior connections .
i want to rerun all bourne' s treadstone material .
every footstep .
kim , box three .
i want to identify his method of travel .
stay on the local cops .
we need a vehicle , a parking ticket , something .
langley' s offered to upload any satellite imaging we need , so let' s find a target for them .
danny , box four .
i need fresh eyes .
review the buy where we lost the neski files .
timeline it with what we know about bourne' s movements .
turn it upside down and see what we find .
come on , guys .
we ran this guy' s life with total control for all those years .
we should be a step ahead ofhim .
you wanna go home ?
find jason bourne .
pamela landy .
this is jason bourne .
bourne ?
it' s bourne .
we need 90 seconds to triangulate his position .
what do you want ?
are you running treadstone ?
treadstone was closed down two years ago .
you know that .
then who' s planning the missions now ?
there are no missions .
it' s over .
then what do you want with me ?
berlin .
have you forgotten what happened in berlin ?
you killed two people , bourne .
you killed two people , bourne .
you killed two people , bourne .
neski ...
vladimir neski ...
vladimir neski ...
bourne ?
i wanna come in .
okay .
how do you wanna do it ?
we need 35 seconds .
i need someone i know to bring me in .
who ?
there was a girl in paris .
she was part of the program .
she used to handle logistics .
alexander strasse , 30 minutes , under the world clock .
send her alone .
give her your phone .
what if i can' t find her ?
it' s easy .
she' s standing right next to you .
there' s just so many areas ...
it' s a very simple layout .
get the second quadrant .
pull it out .
where is it ?
get the second quadrant , please .
pull it all the way up .
clock is right here ...
shit , he' s put her in the middle of everything .
this is a security nightmare .
there is no way we are going to get her covered ...
call a mayday into berlin station .
we need snipers , d. o. d. , whatever they' ve got .
no snipers .
you put snipers on the roof and it' il scare him off , and i need answers .
you can' t really believe he wants to come in .
he knows something about the neski case .
i' m not gonna pass up this chance to find out what it is .
don' t be a fool .
not when we' re this close .
are we talking about protecting nicky or killing bourne ?
we' re talking about killing bourne .
we' re talking about the next dead body .
it might be nicky .
it will be someone .
you' re not hearing me .
bourne dead gives me nothing .
can i talk to you privately ?
what ?
i know how you' re feeling .
you lost two men in berlin and you want it to mean something .
but nothing bourne gives you will bring your men back .
nothing in those files makes their sacrifice worthwhile .
you have to let go .
we' re professionals .
when an operation goes bad , we tie it off .
if there' s something you' re not telling me , i want it now before i send that girl out there .
do you understand ?
you talk about this stuff like you read it in a book .
what do you want to do ?
put the snipers in place .
if things go bad , we take him out .
you got it .
hub , this is survey one .
we have a crowd moving in .
it' s some sort of protest march .
i' m sorry .
this is as close as i can get .
survey two , can you get in any closer ?
kurt , make sure the south end is covered .
roger .
affirmative .
copy that .
hello .
there' s a tram coming towards you .
get on it .
she' s moving to the tram .
where' s it going ?
the tram is going to alexanderplatz station .
survey five , i can' t see him .
i don' t see him .
hub , this is survey two , she' s getting on a tram .
she' s getting on the tram .
zoom in on the tram .
bourne' s on the tram .
i don' t think he' s on the tram .
he' s on the tram .
send them in to follow .
tell them to keep their distance .
okay , delta , let' s go .
get on it .
come on .
let' s go .
tell her to hurry .
there' s nothing on the south side .
alexanderplatz station , 25 seconds .
