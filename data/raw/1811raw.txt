she wasn' t the main attraction , she was only under card to the middle weight title fight .
but ask someone who was there , and they couldn' t tell you who else fought that night .
she' s tough ,
i can' t go inside , i can' t get close enough to hit her .

my daddy had a german shephard , axl , axl' s hind quarters were so bad he had to drag himself room to room by his front legs , me , me and mardel bust up laughing watching him scoop across the kitchen floor .
daddy , he so sick by then he couldn' t hardly stand himself , but one morning he got up , carried axl into his rig and the two of them went off into the woods singing and howling , but wasn' t til he got home that night alone , that i saw the shovel in the back of the truck .

how' s the blood boss ?
how many eyes do you need to finish this fight ?
one' s enough .
now , what do i do about the bear ?
stepping to the outside and hooking the liver ?
i' ve been doing that , she' s waiting to steal .
i know but i dont want you to go to the liver this time , i want you to heel , right up under her skinny ass , understand ?
right in the cianic nerve , just keep digging it in there , digging it in , and just keep sticking her , you hear that ?
what about the ref ?
just keep yourself between the ref and the bear and things' il just be fine .
this is yours , keep your guard up , keep it up .
c' mon breathe , that' s it , breathe , good ....
how you feeling darling ?
i wanna beard boss .
i thought it might help me with the ladies .
can' t say it does .
does it , does it hurt much ?
don' t hurt at all .
that' s good .
where' s frankie ?
he' s uh , he' s out there talking to the doctors , probably telling them how to do their job .
there telling em i' m a c1 and c2 complete , means my spinal cord is still broken never be able to breathe easy .
that i' il be frozen like this for the rest of my life .
i asked them to tell him , i dont know how' s he gonna take it .
did you see the fight ?
of course i did .
you had her cold maggie .
i should' nt have dropped my hands , i shouldn' t have turned ,
always protect myself how many times he would tell me that .
yeah he does like to repeat himself .
well you tell him , i' m real sorry .
no , i wont do no such thing maggie .
damnest thing , so what' s the plan , i know you got one , so you might as well tell me what it is ?
it' s your fault , yeah it' s your fault she' s lying in there like that , you kept after me until i trained her , i knew i shouldn' t have done it , her being a girl and all everything kept telling me not to , everything but you .
i' m gonna get you outta here , doctors around here dont know squat , why would they be living here out in the desert , as soon as you' il be able to be moved , find some place where they actually studied medicine , you just rest there and i' m on it .
frankie must have called every hospital in america looking for somebody who would tell him they could fix her , came close twice , til they checked her over said there was nothing to be done , took 2 months til she was stable enough to move .
they got nurses for that you know .
the' re amateurs .
she developed skin cause she couldn' t change positions .
thank you .
it made the 6th trip by ambulance .
fly there , drive back .
the rehab center frankie found was a nice place , they took good care of maggie she would have complained if they hadn' t .
took her several hours everyday to get her ready for the wheel chair .
since she couldn' t breathe on her own , the resperators were always on , oxygen was pumped in her 24hours a day .
maggie' s momma called to say they were all coming for a visit , she waited by the window everyday for the next 2 weeks .
frankie finally tracked them down , learned they checked into their hotel 6 days earlier , kept leaving messages which were never returned .
you dont have to hang around all day .
no , i like it here , i dont mind , fact if you weren' t here i' d come here anyway to read my books .
momma' il be here soon to share some of the burden .
oh it' s no burden , here read this .
ok ok that' s enough , that' s terrible .
but anyway i' il tell ya in english what your saying , it says that " i will arise and go now , and go to in its free , in a small cabin built there of clay and waddles made , and i shall have some peace there , for peace comes dropping slow , dropping from the vales of the morning to where the crickets sings .
not bad huh ?
you gonna build a cabin boss ?
me ?
yeah , you know when you quit all this .
you mean boxing ?
no i' il never quit ,
like the stink too much i guess .
you think ? cause i could see you there real easy with your books and lemon pie .
how about you would you like to go live in a cabin ?
i could learn how to bake .
ya well then i' il maybe i' il start looking then .
hi i' m frankie dunn , i met you back out in missouri . where' s my little girl ?
well don' t you think you oughta go back to the hotel and change , she doesn' t know you' ve been here a week visiting woody and mickey .
we got business with my sister , why dont you tell us where she is ?
well you must be jd and you must be the business guy ,
look there' s some rides you missed , why don' t you just go on back and i' il tell her you couldn' t make it .
i drove all the way here to take care of my child and your suggesting i' m not a good mother ?
marianne can' t go no where , if we could have taken her to disneyland we would' ve .
maggie fitgerald ?
right down here 301 .
> <
just some kind of legal thing . what is it ?
how we all doing here ?
sorry darling but we aint got alot of time , mr johnson is charging us a lot of money to be here to make sure this is done proper .
why dont you just leave that and i' il read it to her later ?
hey old man , you part of our family ? stay the hell out of this .
read it to me momma .
just something legal , protect your money .
momma you dont have to worry , the boxing commission is paying for all this , everything .
what if they dont marianne ? mr johnson says they can take my house .
if you assign your assets to your mother no one will be able to touch them .
no doctors , no funeral expenses , nothing .
now look , why dont you just leave it and i' il just read it to her later on .
mr dunn with respect this aint your business .
alright , i' il be out in the hall .
you' ve been a good daughter marianne , you sign that paper it' il take care of your family ,
like the way your daddy would have wanted you to , uh how do you make your mark .
can you hold a pen ?
she gotta do it with her teeth momma .
huh ?
you got to put it in her mouth .
here you go honey .
did you see the fight momma ?
now you know how i feel about that .
i did pretty good .
you lost marianne , ain' t your fault the way i heard it but you lost , dont want to lost the rest of what you got left .
what happen to you ?
what' s that supposed to mean ?
momma you take mardee and jd get home , before i tell that lawyer there your so worried about your welfare you never signed those house papers like you were supposed to ,
so anytime i feel like it , i can sell that house from under your fat lazy hill billy ass , and if you ever come back , that' s exactly what i' il do .
well maybe someone oughta count to 10 .
doesn' t smell real pretty does it doc ?
you might have to lose it maggie .
they took my leg boss .
it' s gonna be alright , here .
all i hear is your voice boss .
need anything ?
need to know what mokulsha means .
well , you didn' t win , i dont have to tell ya .
you are the meanest man i' ve ever met , no wonder no one loves you ,
you remind me of my daddy .
well he must have been a very intelligent , handsome man .
you ain' t gonna make me tap no more 8' s are ya ?
no i was , looking at this catalog from city college ,
i thought i' d get ya a wheel chair maybe the kind that operates by moving through a straw , thought maybe you' d like to go back to school .
got a favor to ask you boss .
sure , anything you want .
well i want what my daddy did for axl .
don' t even think about that .
i can' t be like this frankie , not after what i' ve done , i' ve seen the world , people chanted my name , hell , not my name , some damn name you gave me , they were chanting for me ,
i was in magazines , you think i' d ever dream that happen ?
i was born 2 pounds 1/ 2 ounces , daddy used to tell me i' d fight to get into this world , and i' d fight my way out , that' s all i wanna do frankie , i just dont want to fight you to do it ,
i got what i needed , i got it all , dont let em keep taking it away from me , dont let me lie here til i can' t hear those people chanting no more .
i can' t , please , please dont ask me .
i' m asking .
can' t .
hello .
in the middle of the night , maggie had found the wrong solution , she' d bit her tongue .
stop , stop , look at me look at me .
nearly bled to death before they stitched her up , she came around and ripped them out before frankie even got there , they stitched her up again , padded the tongue so she couldn' t bite .
you can' t do it , you know that .
i do father , you dont know how thick she is , how hard it was to train her , other fighters would do exactly what you would say to them and , she' d ask why this , and why that , and do it her own way anyway , she fought for the title , wasn' t by anything , wasn' t by listening to me .
but now she wants to die , and i just want to keep her with me ,
and i swear to god father it' s , it' s committing a sin by doing it , by keeping her alive i' m killing her , how do i get around that ?
you don' t , you step aside frankie , you leave her with god .
she' s not asking for god' s help , she' s asking for mine .
frankie i' ve seen you at mass almost everyday for 23 years , the only person that comes to church that much is the kind that can' t forgive themself for something , whatever sins you carry there nothing compared to this , forget about god , or heaven and hell , if you do this thing , you' d be lost , somewhere so deep .
you' il never find yourself again .
i' m keeping her sedated so she wont try that again .
went to see maggie this morning , you must have been somewhere else .
ya .
you got a fighter i dont know about ?
wasn' t your fault , i was wrong to say that .
your damn right , i found you a fighter , and you made her the best fighter she could be .
i killed her .
don' t say that , maggie walked through that door with nothing but guts , no chance in the world of being what she needed to be , a year and a half later she' s fighting for the championship of the world , you did that , people die every day frankie mopping floors , washing dishes , and you know what their last thought is , i never got my shot , because of you maggie got her shot , if she dies today you know what her last thought would be ?
i think i did alright .
i know i could rest with that .
ya , ya .
i' m gonna get a cup of coffee .
alright ,
i' m gonna disconnect your air machine and your gonna go to sleep
and i' il give you a shot and you' il stay asleep .
mokulsha means " my darling , my blood
he gave her a single shot , it was enough adrenaline to do the job a few times over , he didn' t want her going through this again .
then he walked out , i dont think he had anything left .
i went back to the gym , waited figuring he' d turn up sooner or later
and that' s when a ghost came through the door .
i got to thinking what you said mr grant .
and what was that danger ?
anybody can lose one fight .
that' s the truth , go ahead and put your clothes on , you missed a lot of training . will do mr grant , sure thing .
frankie never came back at all ,
frankie didn' t leave a note , and nobody knew where he went ,
i' d hope he' d gone to find you , to ask you one more time to forgive him , but maybe he didn' t have anything left in his heart , i' d just hope he found some place where he could find a little peace , a place set in the cedars and oak trees , somewhere between no where and goodbye , but that' s probably wishfull thinking , no matter where he is , i thought you should know what kind of man your father really was .
