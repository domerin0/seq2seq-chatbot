all right , chewie , let' s get out of here !
the empire is still out there .
i don' t think it' s wise to ...
no time to discuss this as a committee .
i am not a committee !
you can' t make the jump to light speed in this asteroid field ...
sit down , sweetheart .
we' re taking off !
look !
i see it , i see it .
we' re doomed !
the cave is collapsing .
this is no cave .
what ?
run !
yes .
a jedi' s strength flows from the force .
but beware of the dark side .
anger ... fear ... aggression .
the dark side of the force are they .
easily they flow , quick to join you in a fight .
if once you start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny , consume you it will , as it did obi wan' s apprentice .
vader .
is the dark side stronger ?
no ... no ... no .
quicker , easier , more seductive .
but how am i to know the good side from the bad ?
you will know .
when you are calm , at peace .
passive .
a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense , never for attack .
but tell me why i can' t ...
no , no , there is no why .
nothing more will i teach you today .
clear your mind of questions .
there' s something not right here .
i feel cold , death .
that place ... is strong with the dark side of the force .
a domain of evil it is .
in you must go .
what' s in there ?
only what you take with you .
your weapons ... you will not need them .
bounty hunters .
we don' t need that scum .
yes , sir .
those rebels won' t escape us .
sir , we have a priority signal from the star destroyer avenger .
right . ... there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the millennium falcon .
you are free to use any methods necessary , but i want them alive .
no disintegrations .
as you wish .
lord vader !
my lord , we have them .
oh , thank goodness we' re coming out of the asteroid field .
let' s get out of here .
ready for light speed ?
one ... two ... three !
it' s not fair !
the transfer circuits are working .
it' s not my fault !
no light speed ?
it' s not my fault .
sir , we just lost the main rear deflector shield .
one more direct hit on the back quarter and we' re done for .
turn her around .
i said turn her around !
i' m going to put all power in the front shield .
you' re going to attack them ? !
sir , the odds of surviving a direct assault on an lmperial star destroyer ...
shut up !
they' re moving to attack position .
shields up !
track them , .
they may come around for another pass .
captain needa , the ship no longer appears on our scopes .
they can' t have disappeared .
no ship that small has a cloaking device .
well , there' s no trace of them , sir .
captain , lord vader demands an update on the pursuit .
get a shuttle ready .
i shall assume full responsibility for losing them , and apologize to lord vader .
meanwhile , continue to scan the area .
yes , captain needa .
use the force .
yes ...
now ... the stone .
feel it .
concentrate !
oh , no .
we' il never get it out now .
so certain are you .
always with you it cannot be done .
hear you nothing that i say ?
master , moving stones around is one thing .
this is totally different .
no !
no different !
only different in your mind .
you must unlearn what you have learned .
all right , i' il give it a try .
no !
try not .
do .
or do not .
there is no try .
i can' t .
it' s too big .
size matters not .
look at me .
judge me by my size , do you ?
and well you should not .
for my ally in the force .
and a powerful ally it is .
life creates it , makes it grow .
it' s energy surrounds us and binds us .
luminous beings are we not this crude matter .
you must feel the force around you .
here , between you ... me ... the tree ... the rock ... everywhere !
yes , even between this land and that ship !
you want the impossible .
i don' t ... i don' t believe it .
that is why you fail .
apology accepted , captain needa .
lord vader , our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing .
if the millennium falcon went into light speed , it' il be on the other side of the galaxy by now .
alert all commands .
calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory .
yes , my lord .
we' il find them .
don' t fail me again , admiral .
alert all commands .
deploy the fleet .
captain solo , this time you have gone too far .
no , i will not be quiet , chewbacca .
why doesn' t anyone listen to me ?
the fleet is beginning to break up .
go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw .
i really don' t see how thats going to help .
surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances .
the empire may be gracious enough ...
thank you .
what did you have in mind for your next move ?
well , if they follow standard lmperial procedure , they' il dump their garbage before they go to light speed , then we just float away .
with the rest of the garbage .
then what ?
then we' ve got to find a safe port somewhere around here .
got any ideas ?
no .
where are we ?
the anoat system ..
anoat system .
there' s not much there .
no .
well , wait .
this is interesting .
lando .
lando system ?
lando' s not a system , he' s a man .
lando calrissian .
he' s a card player , gambler , scoundrel .
you' d like him .
thanks .
bespin .
it' s pretty far , but i think we can make it .
a mining colony ?
yeah , a tibanna gas mine .
lando conned somebody out of it .
we go back a long way , lando and me .
can you trust him ?
no .
but he has no love for the empire , i can tell you that .
here we go , chewie .
stand by .
detach !
you do have your moments .
not many , but you have them .
concentrate ... feel the force flow .
yes .
good .
calm , yes .
through the force , things you will see .
other places .
the future ... the past .
old friends long gone .
han !
leia !
control , control .
you must learn control .
i saw ... i saw a city in the clouds .
mmm .
friends you have there .
they were in pain .
it is the future you see .
future ?
will they die ?
difficult to see .
always in motion is the future .
i' ve got to go to them .
decide you must how to serve them best .
if you leave now , help them you could .
but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered .
no , i don' t have a landing permit .
i' m trying to reach lando calrissian .
whoa !
wait a minute !
let me explain .
you will not deviate from your present course .
rather touchy , aren' t they ?
i thought you knew this person .
well , that was a long time ago .
i' m sure he' s forgotten about that .
permission granted to land on platform three two seven .
thank you .
there' s nothing to worry about .
we go way back , lando and me .
who' s worried ?
oh .
no one to meet us .
i don' t like this .
well , what would you like ?
well , they did let us land .
look , don' t worry .
everything' s going to be fine .
trust me .
see ?
my friend .
keep your eyes open , ok ?
why , you slimy , double crossing , no good swindler !
you' ve got a lot of guts coming here , after what you pulled .
how you doing , you old pirate ?
so good to see you !
i never thought i' d catch up with you again .
where you been ?
well , he seems very friendly .
yes ... very friendly .
what are you doing here ?
ahh ... repairs .
i thought you could help me out .
what have you done to my ship ?
your ship ?
hey , remember , you lost her to me fair and square .
how are you doing , chubacca .
you' re still hanging around this loser ?
hello .
what have we here ?
welcome .
i' m lando calrissian . who might you be ?
leia .
welcome , leia .
all right , all right , you old smoothie .
hello , sir .
i am see threepio , human cyborg relations .
my facilities are at your ...
well , really !
what' s wrong with the falcon ?
hyperdrive .
i' il get my people to work on it .
good .
you know , that ship saved my life quite a few times .
she' s the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy .
how' s the gas mine ?
is it paying off for you ?
oh , not as well as i' d like .
we' re a small outpost and not very self sufficient .
and i' ve had supply problems of every kind .
i' ve had labor difficulties ...
what' s so funny ?
you .
listen to you you sound like a businessman , a responsible leader .
who' d have thought that , huh ?
you know , seeing you sure brings back a few things .
yeah .
yeah , i' m responsible these days .
it' s the price you pay for being successful .
oh !
nice to see a familiar face .
e chu ta !
how rude !
hello ?
how interesting .
who are you ?
oh , my .
oh , i' m terribly sorry .
i ... i didn' t mean to intrude .
no , no , please don' t get up .
no !
luke !
you must complete the training .
i can' t keep the vision out of my head .
they' re my friends .
i' ve got to help them .
you must not go !
but han and leia will die if i don' t .
you don' t know that .
even yoda cannot see their fate .
but i can help them !
i feel the force !
but you cannot control it .
this is a dangerous time for you , when you will be tempted by the dark side of the force .
yes , yes .
to obi wan you listen .
the cave .
remember your failure at the cave !
but i' ve learned so much since then .
master yoda , i promise to return and finish what i' ve begun .
you have my word .
it is you and your abilities the emperor wants .
that is why your friends are made to suffer .
and that is why i have to go .
luke , i don' t want to lose you to the emperor the way i lost vader .
you won' t .
stopped they must be .
on this depends only a fully trained jedi knight with the force as his ally will conquer vader and his emperor .
if you end your training now , if you choose the quick and easy path , as vader did , you will become an agent of evil .
patience .
and sacrifice han and leia ?
if you honor what they fight for ... yes !
if you choose to face vader , you will do it alone .
i cannot interfere .
i understand .
artoo , fire up the converters .
luke , don' t give in to hate that leads to the dark side .
strong is vader .
mind what you have learned .
save you it can .
i will .
and i' il return .
i promise .
told you , i did .
reckless is he .
now matters are worse .
that boy is our last hope .
no .
there is another .
the ship is almost finished .
two or three more things and we' re in great shape .
the sooner the better .
something' s wrong here .
no one has seen or knows anything about threepio .
he' s been gone too long to have gotten lost .
relax .
i' il talk to lando and see what i can find out .
i don' t trust lando .
well , i don' t trust him , either .
but he is my friend .
besides , we' il soon be gone .
and then you' re as good as gone , aren' t you ?
what happened ?
where ?
found him in a junk pile ?
oh , what a mess .
chewie , do you think you can repair him ?
lando' s got people who can fix him .
no , thanks .
i' m sorry .
am i interrupting anything ?
not really .
you look absolutely beautiful .
you truly belong here with us among the clouds .
thank you .
will you join me for a little refreshment ?
everyone' s invited , of course .
having trouble with you droid ?
no .
no problem .
why ?
so you see , since we' re a small operation , we don' t fall into the ... uh ... jurisdiction of the empire .
so you' re part of the mining guild then ?
no , not actually .
our operation is small enough not to be noticed ... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves .
aren' t you afraid the empire' s going to find out about this little operation and shut you down ?
that' s always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we' ve built here .
but things have developed that will insure security .
i' ve just made a deal that will keep the empire out of here forever .
we would be honored if you would join us .
i had no choice .
they arrived right before you did .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , too .
no , threepio' s with them .
just hang on .
we' re almost there .
mmmm .
oh , my .
uh , i , uh take this off !
i , uh , don' t mean to intrude here .
i , don' t , no , no , no ... please don' t get up .
no !
stormtroopers ?
here ?
we' re in danger .
i must tell the others .
oh , no !
i' ve been shot !
lord vader .
you may take captain solo to jabba the hut after i have skywalker .
he' s no good to me dead .
he will not be permanently damaged .
lord vader , what about leia and the wookiee ?
they must never again leave this city .
that was never a condition of our agreement , nor was giving han to this bounty hunter !
perhaps you think you' re being treated unfairly .
no .
good .
it would be unfortunate if i had to leave a garrison here .
this deal' s getting worse all the time .
oh , yes , that' s very good .
i like that .
oh !
something' s not right because now i can' t see .
wait .
wait !
oh , my ! what have you done ?
i' m backwards , you stupid furball .
only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough ...
i feel terrible .
why are they doing this ?
they never even asked me any questions .
lando .
get out of here , lando !
shut up and listen !
vader has agreed to turn leia and chewie over to me .
over to you ?
they' il have to stay here , but at least they' il be safe .
what about han ?
vader' s giving him to the bounty hunter .
vader wants us all dead .
he doesn' t want you at all .
he' s after somebody called skywalker .
luke ?
lord vader has set a trap for him .
and we' re the bait .
well , he' s on his way .
perfect .
you fixed us all pretty good , didn' t you ?
my friend !
stop !
i' ve done all i can do .
i' m sorry i couldn' t do better , but i have my own problems .
yeah , you' re a real hero .
you certainly have a way with people .
this facility is crude , but it should be adequate to freeze skywalker for his journey to the emperor .
lord vader , ship approaching .
x wing class .
good .
monitor skywalker and allow him to land .
lord vader , we only use this facility for carbon freezing .
if you put him in there , it might kill him .
i do not want the emperor' s prize damaged .
we will test it ... on captain solo .
if only you had attached my legs , i wouldn' t be in this ridiculous position .
now , remember , chewbacca , you have a responsibility to me , so don' t do anything foolish .
what' s going on ... buddy ?
you' re being put into carbon freeze .
what he doesn' t survive ?
he' s worth a lot to me .
the empire will compensate you if he dies .
put him in !
oh , no !
no , no , no !
stop , chewbacca , stop ... !
stop , chewie , stop !
do you hear me ?
stop !
yes , stop , please !
i' m not ready to die .
chewie !
chewie , this won' t help me .
hey !
save your strength .
there' il be another time .
the princess you have to take care of her .
you hear me ?
i love you !
i know .
what ... what' s going on ?
turn around , chewbacca , i can' t see .
oh ... they' ve encased him in carbonite .
he should be quite well protected if hesurvives the freezing process , that is .
well , calrissian , did he survive ?
yes , he' s alive .
and in perfect hibernation .
he' s all yours bounty hunter .
reset the chamber for skywalker .
skywalker has just landed , my lord .
good .
see to it that he finds his way here .
calrissian , take the princess and the wookiee to my ship .
you said they' d be left in the city under my supervision .
i am altering the deal .
pray i don' t alter it any further .
luke !
luke , don' t it' s a trap !
it' s a trap !
the force is with you , young skywalker .
but you are not a jedi yet .
well done .
hold them in the security tower and keep it quiet .
move .
what do you think you' re doing ?
we' re getting out of here .
i knew all along it had to be a mistake .
do you think that after what you did to han we' re going to trust you ?
i had no choice ...
what are you doing ?
trust him , trust him !
oh , so we understand , don' t we , chewie ?
he had no choice .
i' m just trying to help ...
we don' t need any of your help .
h a a a ...
what ?
it sounds like han .
there' s still a chance to save han ... i mean , at the east platform ...
chewie .
i' m terribly sorry about all this .
after all , he' s only a wookiee .
put captain solo in the cargo hold .
artoo !
artoo !
where have you been ?
turn around , you wooly ... !
hurry , hurry !
we' re trying to save han from the bounty hunter
well , at least your still in one piece !
look what happened to me !
you have learned much , young one .
you' il find i' m full of surprises .
your destiny lies with me , skywalker .
obi wan knew this to be true .
no !
all to easy .
perhaps you are not as strong as the emperor thought .
impressive ... most impressive .
obi wan has taught you well .
you have controlled your fear ... now release your anger .
only your hatred can destroy me .
the security codes has been changed !
artoo , you can tell the computer to override the security system .
attention !
this is lando calrissian .
the empire has takes control of the city .
advise everyone to leave before more lmperial troops arrive .
this way .
don' t blame me .
i' m an interpreter .
i' m not supposed to know a power socket from acomputer terminal .
what are you talking about ?
we' re not interested in the hyperdrive on the millennium falcon .
it' s fixed !
just open the door , you stupid lump .
i never doubted you for a second .
wonderful !
ouch !
oh !
ah !
that hurt , bend down , you thoughtless ... ow !
leia !
go !
i thought that hairy beast would be the end of me .
of course , i' ve looked better .
you are beaten .
it is useless to resist .
don' t let yourself be destroyed as obi wan did .
there is no escape .
don' t make me destroy you .
you do not yet realize your importance .
you have only begun to discover you power .
join me and i will complete your training .
with our combined strength , we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy .
i' il never join you !
if you only knew the power of the dark side .
obi wan never told you what happened to your father .
he told me enough !
he told me you killed him .
no .
i am your father .
no .
no .
that' s not true !
that' s impossible !
search your feelings .
you know it to be true .
no !
no !
luke .
you can destroy the emperor .
he has foreseen this .
it is your destiny .
join me , and we can rule the galaxy as father and son .
come with me .
it' s the only way .
leia ...
hear me !
leia !
luke ... we' ve got to go back .
what ?
i know where luke is .
but what about those fighters ?
chewie , just do it .
but what about vader ?
all right , all right , all right .
look , someone' s up there .
it' s luke .
chewie , slow down .
slow down and we' il get under him .
lando , open the top hatch .
okay .
easy , chewie .
lando ?
okay , let' s go .
oh , leia .
all right , chewie .
let' s go .
i' il be back .
star destroyer .
all right , chewie .
ready for light speed .
if your people fixed the hyperdrive .
all the coordinates are set .
it' s now or never .
punch it !
they told me they fixed it .
i trusted them to fix it .
it' s not my fault !
they' il be in range of our tractor beam in moments , lord .
did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the millennium falcon ?
yes , my lord .
good .
prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun .
yes , my lord .
iieutenant !
yes , sir .
noisy brute .
why don' t we just go into light speed ?
we can' t ?
how would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated ?
the city' s central computer told you ?
artoo detoo , you know better than to trust a strange computer .
ouch !
pay attention to what you' re doing !
luke .
father .
son , come with me .
ben , why didn' t you tell me ?
chewie !
it' s vader .
luke ... it is your destiny .
ben , why didn' t you tell me ?
alert all commands .
ready for the tractor beam .
artoo , come back at once !
you haven' t finished with me yet !
you don' t know how to fix the hyperdrive .
chewbacca can do it .
i' m standing here in pieces , and you' re having delusions of grandeur !
oh , you did it !
luke , we' re ready for takeoff .
good luck , lando .
when we find jabba the hut and that bounty hunter , we' il contact you .
i' il meet you at the rendezvous point on tatooine .
princess , we' il find han .
i promise .
chewie , i' il be waiting for your signal .
take care , you two .
may the force be with you .
