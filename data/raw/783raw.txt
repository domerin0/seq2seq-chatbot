once upon a time , in a faraway kingdom , lived a beautiful little girl ... ... and her widowed father
it' s beautiful .
okay it wasn' t that long ago and it wasn' t really a faraway kingdom
it was the san fernando valley it looked faraway ... ... because you barely see it through the smog
but to me , growing up , the valley was my kingdom
i was my dad' s best friend and he was mine
being raised by a man put me behind in the makeup and fashion departments
but i never felt like i missed out on anything
i was the luckiest girl in the world
my dad owned the coolest diner i loved hanging out there
diet was a four letter word here ... ... and grease came at no additional charge
at hal' s , everyone felt like family
oh , yeah , i have drinks .
happy birthday !
make a wish , princess .
what did i need a wish for ?
i had amazing friends and the coolest dad
fiona
i am so sorry .
you look beautiful , fiona .
hey , hal !
along with my new stepmother came her twin daughters , brianna and gabriella
my out of step sisters
but as long as my dad was happy , so was l we were going to be one big , happy family
cheese .
one' s enough .
unfortunately , this was no fairy tale
he took her hand , and he kissed it .
then he swooped her up onto his horse .
and the beautiful princess and the handsome prince rode off to his castle ... ... where they lived happily ever after .
do fairy tales come true , dad ?
well , no .
but dreams come true .
do you have a dream ?
yeah .
my dream is that you' il grow up and go to college ... ... and then maybe someday you' il build your own castle .
where do princesses go to college ?
they go ... ... where the princes go .
they go to princeton .
but , sam , you know , fairy tales aren' t just about finding handsome princes .
they' re about fulfilling your dreams ... ... and about standing up for what you believe in .
as i always say , never let the fear of striking out ...
keep you from playing the game .
right .
just remember , if you look carefully , this book contains important things ... ... that you may need to know later in life .
earthquake .
my kingdom crumbled ... ... during the northridge earthquake
help !
help !
don' t go .
i' il be right back .
i lost my best friend that day
from then on , the only fairy tales in my life ... ... were the ones i read about in books
since my father didn' t leave a will , my stepmother got everything
the house , the diner , and to her dismay , me

come on , get going .
and flying karamazov .

leave those on .
the lawn looks a little brown .
fiona , we' re supposed to be conserving water .
we' re in the middle of a drought .

carter , you could do so much better than shelby cummings .
even in your mind .
there' s another spot .

austin .
people like shelby and austin ... ... are genetically programmed to find each other .
how can so much ego be in one relationship ?
imagine what they say about you .
they don' t even know i exist .

the white zone is for cool people only .

laugh out loud .
i wanna hear your laugh when can we finally meet ?

how' s your day so far ?
raging stepmom , work and cool kids who can' t get over themselves

i can be surrounded by a sea of people and still feel all alone
then i think of you
hey , nomad , do you think we' ve ever met ?
i don' t know our school has over 3500 kids
well , that narrows it down
well , at least i can eliminate the guys
you' re not a guy , right ?
because if you are , i' il kick your butt
i am not a guy
have you told your dad about princeton yet ?
if only i could i haven' t even told him i wanna be a writer
my father always encouraged me to pursue my dreams
not mine he has another plan for my life
it' s 2 a m we' ve been at this for five hours
well , i think we broke our record
we should turn in sweet dreams  wait
i can' t sleep without knowing there' s hope .
half the night i waste in sighs
in a wakeful doze i sorrow
for the hand , the lips ... ... the eyes
for the meeting of tomorrow

you talk to him all the time .
you know him .
i know , but he doesn' t know me .
what if i meet him and i' m not what he expects ?
maybe this whole relationship' s just better for cyberspace .

you have to go to that dance , okay ?
this nomad guy isn' t gonna be in one place for long , all right ?
lf it helps , i' il be your escort .

others need you to go to the diner and mop the floors tonight .

" i' m a very appealing person .

she' s gonna have to go through me to hurt you .
go , girlfriend .

call me " girlfriend " one more time .
okay , sorry .
sam , your dad did not leave this earth wanting you to be unhappy .
it' s time for you to find your own bliss , starting with this dance .

you' re always studying , always working .
take some time for yourself .

i was saving this dress for my next attempt down the aisle .
long story .
it' s beautiful .
rhonda , i can' t wear that .
yes , you can .
and you will .
that dress has been in that box so long , it deserves a night out .
let' s go .
this is gonna look so good on you .
welcome , north valley high school seniors to the halloween homecoming dance .
tonight , our panel of esteemed teachers will use their years of higher education ... ... to choose our homecoming prince and princess .
in true l. a. fashion , it' s not about who you are .
it' s about what you wear .
are you ready to crank it up ?
yeah .
i cannot believe i put you in charge of costumes .
i told you siamese cats , not siamese twins .
are we having a catfight ?
welcome , guys .
what up ?
sorry about your costume getting lost .
it' s all good .
no , it' s not .
we don' t get to be the three musketeers .
you get to be prince charming and we' re the two wimps in wigs .
take the cape off already .
you look amazing .
i' m sorry , i' m just freaking out here .
listen , it' s gonna be okay .
hurry up , it' s almost 11 .
carter , wait .

okay .
all right , there .
now , give me the cape .
come on , it' s time
sam , what are they all staring at ?

sam , don' t worry , okay ?
any guy would have to be completely insane not to like you , all right ?
i' m just gonna be standing right over here .
okay .
do you know you' re standing precisely in the middle of the dance floor ?
fate has brought us together right here at this anointed hour ... ... under the shimmering disco ball .
terry .
are you nomad ?
nomad ?
indeed .
i have traveled through time and space to find you .
now join me in the mating dance of zion .
terry , that' s nice .
hey , i know that girl from somewhere .
i' m thirsty .
i gotta get some punch ...
some libations for the fair maiden ?
your wish is my command .
i knew this was too good to be true .
princeton girl ?
austin ames ?
you' re nomad ?
yeah , i guess my costume doesn' t do ... ... a very good job at hiding who i am .
no , i know exactly who you are .
i' m sorry .
this was a really big mistake .
i' ve gotta go .
wait .
wait .
wait .
it' s not a mistake .
don' t you know who i am ?
of course i do .
you' re princeton girl .
you' re the girl i' ve been waiting to meet .
i know who you are .
what' s your name ?
your sweet libations , my lady .
mr. anderson .
austin ames with my lady .
a devastating blow .
a worthy opponent .
what about your girlfriend ?
it' s over .
i guess you were expecting some guy who hangs out at starbucks ... ... and writes poetry .
something like that .
come on , you' re austin ames .
you' re football captain and student body president .
and closet poet ?
you can' t be both guys .
i' m not .
then who are you ?
i live in a world full of people pretending to be something they' re not .
but when i talk to you ...
" i' m the guy i wanna be .
give me a chance to be that guy .
do you want to join me for a stroll outside ?
if you wanna be voted homecoming prince , you' d better stay inside .
i really don' t care about becoming homecoming prince .
so , princeton girl , would you tell me who you are if i guessed it right ?
maybe .
maybe ?
well , how about we play 20 questions .
how about 10 .
i' il take what i can get .
okay , first question .
you do actually go to north valley high school , right ?
of course .
look , i' m just checking .
i mean , you never know with the internet .
okay , next question .
were you disappointed when you found out that i was nomad ?
be honest .
surprisingly , no .
did you vote for me for student body president ?
surprisingly , yes .
really ?
okay , i got it .
given the choice ... ... would you rather have a rice cake or a big mac ?
a big mac .
but what does that matter ?
well , i like a girl with a hearty appetite .
and besides , you just eliminated about 50 percent of the girls in our class .
you' d think i' d remember those eyes .
you' re so beautiful .
next question .
what' s up , girl ?
what are you supposed to be ?
a three musketeer .
you don' t look like a candy bar .
right .
look , now that you and austin are toast ... ... okay , why don' t we have our own little party .
back off , david .
come on , shelby .
i know you like me .
no .
stop it .
no .
i know ...
i know it .
no , stop it .

the lady said , " stop .
oh , yeah ?

well , i hate to tell you this , dude ... ... but i starred in pirates of penzance three times .
oh , yeah ?

there' s no music .
so ?
all out of questions ?
do you believe in love at first sight ?
i' il let you know .
but i' ve seen you before ?
yes .
man .
how could i have seen you before ... ... and not know who you are now ?
maybe you were looking , but you weren' t really seeing .
you' ve got one more question left .
okay .
do you , princeton girl ... ... feel like you made the right choice meeting me here tonight ?
i do .
and do you , austin ames , ever wanna see me again after tonight ?
i' d have to think about that .
absolutely .

i' ve gotta go .
you have a curfew or something ?
something like that .
i' m sorry , but thank you .

austin ames was crowned prince of the homecoming dance .
big shocker there .
didn' t see that one coming .
but the real mystery , though , is who was his princess ?
how long are you grounded for ?
well , how long is forever ?
so you' re not gonna tell austin ?
come on , carter .
it' s not like he' il pine for me .
trust me , he' s forgotten all about cinderella by now .
yeah , he' s obviously forgotten all about you .
dude , why are you going through all this trouble for one chick ?
look , she' s not just some chick , all right ?
she was real .
real .
like , she still had her old nose .
no , real .
a girl who has more on her mind than what she wears ... ... or how much weight she wants to lose .
she listens to me .
listens to you ?
hey , brother , i listen to you , okay ?
i feel your pai ...
hello , kitty .
yeah , you' re a great listener .
well ...
look , man , you found her cell phone .
you just gotta get some clue from that .
the phone' s locked .
i keep getting messages like , " i need you , " and , " come see me now .
oh , dude , it' s so hot .
see , that' s what i thought .
until i got one that said , " come fix fryer .
oh , dude , that' s hot and kinky , baby .
you know what i' m saying ?
can i get one ?
let me get a pound , baby .
he' s looking for you everywhere .
tell him it was you .
isn' t it better to cling to what might' ve been ... ... instead of ruining everything with reality ?
you can' t hide from him forever .
not forever .
just until graduation , when i leave this place and never see him again .
okay , so , what about you , zorro ?
when are you gonna tell shelby ?
well , i' ve been thinking about doing just that , as a matter of fact .
right .
okay , so the day you tell shelby it was you , i' il tell austin it was me .

look in the yearbook again .
maybe she' s foreign exchange .
that' s hot .

he was so mysterious , but really obvious at the same time .
i mean , kind of dangerous , but very safe .
and wild , but tame .
i' m gonna go change .
i cannot believe you' re gonna tell shelby it was you .
sam , once she realizes that she' s found her zorro , okay , she' il be thrilled .
now , watch and learn .
good luck .

i' m cinderella , your dream girl .
you see , i live in a world full of ...
you .

the girl that i met at the dance , she dropped something on her way out .

excuse me , miss ?
do you ever feel like if you show someone who you really are ... ... they won' t accept you ?
yeah .
i do .
like being yourself isn' t good enough .

like you' re wearing a mask .
that' s exactly how i feel .
you just wanna be honest with this person and tell them , " it' s me .
i' m the one that you' ve been looking for .
yeah .
austin ... ... l' m ...
sam !

oh , great , thank you so much .
thank you very much , sam .
you' re welcome .
don' t hose your lawn , your car , or anybody else , for that matter
and remember , tickets for the big game go on sale ...
and then she told us that she was going to try to steal ... ... austin away from you if that was the last thing she did .
our stepsister has always been jealous of you .
go on .
well , that' s when she invented this whole cinderella plot .
she got ahold of austin' s e mail address ... ... and that' s when she started the whole affair .
we wanted to tell you sooner , but she threatened to kill us .
she' s such a monster .
look , if you don' t believe us , look at the e mails .
she goes by princeton girl 818 , but her real name is sam montgomery .
and we' re brianna and gabriella .
so that little boyfriend stealer thinks she can pull a fast one on me ?
well , we' il just see about that .
austin was really late today and asked me if you' d read this announcement .
cinderella ... ... if you' re listening , your prince wants to rendezvous with you after the pep rally
nothing like a pep rally to warm up our prince
carter !
i talked to him .
and not as cinderella .
i talked to him as me , sam , and he didn' t hate me .
so you told him everything ?
no , not everything .
not the part about me being cinderella .
but i' m gonna go tell him right after the pep rally .
you coming , cowboy ?
so you think i look like a real cowboy ?
sure .
who we gonna beat ?
the lancers !
and when we gonna beat them ?
friday !
good news .
i just got off the phone with hank cole .
you play well on friday , and your future is set at usc football .
that' s great , dad .
and who' s gonna lead us to victory ?
austin !
i can' t hear you !
kill the lancers !
austin !
the cheerleaders have put together a skit to help get us in the spirit .
i love you , shelby !
thank you .
once upon a time , there was a big , strong fighting frog .
he had a beautiful girlfriend , and his dad owned the biggest pond in all the land .
but he still wasn' t happy .
if only he can find a princess , then she could kiss him ... ... turn him into a prince , and they would run away together .
one night , after the slimy frog ditches his super hot ... ... senior poll most popular girlfriend , he meets his princess .
your highness .
alas , it turned out that our frog not only had a secret identity ... ... but also had a secret e mail relationship with a pen pal named princeton girl .
this isn' t good .
dear princeton girl , i can' t wait till we finally get to meet .
you' re the only one who understands the real me .
the man who doesn' t want to play usc football .
but who wants to be at princeton , with you .
what are they talking about ?
nothing .
dear nomad , i want you to know who i am , but i' m scared !
i' m scared that you' il reject me .
and i' ve never had a real kiss before .
i can' t believe they' re reading my e mails .
let' s go .
but our princess had a secret too .
she wasn' t royalty at all , but a geek , a loser , a servant girl .
yeah !
any ideas about this ?
and who , may you ask , is this imposter ?
give it up for the pretend princess , diner girl , sam montgomery !
diner girl !
diner girl !
diner girl !
diner girl !
come on .
sam !
go away !
but , sam , you' ve got a letter from princeton .
what does it say ?
i didn' t get in .
oh , no !
and you studied so hard .
i can' t believe i actually thought i had a chance .
sam , i' m heartbroken .
life can be so unfair .
well , just look at the bright side .
you have a job at the diner for the rest of your life .
you want a cookie ?
they' re so moist .
people like her don' t belong in our world , austin .
sam , what are you doing ?
i' m trying to get these floors clean .
come on , sweetie , get up .
what i meant is , what are you doing with your life ?
i' m diner girl .
i' m doing what diner girls do , rhonda .
baby , what' s gotten into you ?
you don' t even realize how blessed you are .
look , you' ve got a whole family behind you .
we have faith in you .
and you gotta have faith in yourself .
mother !
sam just ruined your wall .
what ?
yes , you did .
well , that' s gonna come out of your paycheck .
and cover up those stupid words .
never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game .
all right .
i' m going off to get some more lipo .
come on , girls .
sam , i need you to clean the pool tonight .
no .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
i quit .
i quit this job .
i quit your family .
and i' m moving out .
oh , and where are you gonna live ?
with me .
you can' t just walk out on me .
you know what , fiona ?
you can mess with your hair , your nose and your face ... ... and you can even mess with my dad' s diner .
but you' re through messing with me .
wait up , sam .
you take one more step , and you' re fired .
oh , no , that won' t be necessary , because i quit too .
and you know what ?
the only reason why i put up with you all these years is because of that girl .
now that she' s free of you , nothing is stopping me from kicking your butt .
come on , no .
not my face .
it' s much newer than the girls .
go for the girls !
mom !
rhonda ?
rhonda !
she' s not even worth it .
you' re right .
you know what ?
i quit too .
me too .
hey , rhonda .
eleanor .
hold up , i need a ride .
see you .
well ...
see you .
send me a bill .
fiona actually thought you were gonna slug her .
i was gonna do more than that .
i had no idea that you were that tough .
yeah , but i always knew that you were .
rhonda ... ... are you sure that this is okay ?
sam , i wouldn' t have it any other way .
i haven' t felt this much at home in such a long time .
i' m sure , compared to the addams family .
what' s on your mind ?
i gotta do something tonight .
don' t wait up for me , okay ?
welcome to the start of tonight' s game between the south bay lancers ... ... and the north valley fighting frogs !
big welcome to all returning alumni to tonight' s 38th annual homecoming game !
check it !
chick at 3 o' clock !
hey , diner girl !
what' s she doing in here ?
what are you doing in here ?
sam .
okay , i know you think i' m just some ...
coward ?
phony ?
okay , just listen .
no , you listen .
you turned out to be exactly who i thought you were .
i never pretended to be somebody else .
it' s been me all along .
and it was me who was hurt in front of everybody .
look , i didn' t come here to yell at you , okay ?
i came to tell you i know what it feels like to be afraid to show who you are .
i was .
but i' m not anymore .
and the thing is , i don' t care what people think about me ... ... because i believe in myself .
and i know that things are gonna be okay .
but even though i have no family and no job and no money for college ... ... it' s you that i feel sorry for .
heads up .
yo , five minutes .
i' m coming .
i know that guy that sent those e mails is somewhere down inside of you .
but i can' t wait for him ... ... because waiting for you is like waiting for rain in this drought .
useless and disappointing .
sam .
sam .
hey .
what are you doing here ?
rhonda told me where you might be .
i thought you could use a friend .
come here .
sam , i' m so proud of you .
you did ...
your stepmom and austin , all in one day .
how do you feel ?
i' il let you know when i can catch my breath .
let' s do something tonight .

you' il go to the game ?
yeah .
i can handle it now .
it' il be our first and last .
and besides , if i don' t go , who else is gonna explain the game to you ?
i like what you' re wearing .
what character are you today ?
myself .
i think it' s your best look .
thank you .
come on , everybody weren' t they great ?

it' s okay .
no !
oh , my god .
touchdown !
the fighting frogs have won they' ve done it they won the game
oh , my ...
you gotta love high school .
so we won the big game that day
but what i remember most was i got my prince
and a really bad cold
after that , it was like everything fell into place
my dad was right the fairy tale book did contain something important
take this one and take the two cars in the front .
i can pay for those parking tickets !
actually , i' m selling your cars , fiona .
for college tuition money .
what gives you the idea you can sell our cars ?
she owns them .
exactly .
i own them .
i' m the county district attorney .
have you ever seen this before ?
i' ve never seen that before .
isn' t this your signature on the witness line ?
i have never seen my husband' s hidden will before .
i' m afraid you' re gonna have to come downtown with me , ma' am .
that hidden will stated that the house , the diner and everything belonged to me
it turned out my stepsisters knew where fiona had filed my real acceptance letter
i got it !
my dad' s diner was restored to its former glory
and my stepmother made a deal with the da
she' s working off her debt to society at hal' s ... ... under the watchful eye of my new partner
and my stepsisters ?
they finally put their teamwork to good use
austin' s dad finally came around and got off his trojan horse
things even cleared up for carter
anything is possible if you just believe .
he ended up filming a commercial
and in addition to landing that commercial ... ... carter also landed the girl
the san fernando valley was clear and beautiful ... ... the way it only is after a big rainstorm
as for austin and me , well , i finally got my cell phone back
we wound up going to princeton together and lived happily ever after
at least for now hey , i' m only a freshman
