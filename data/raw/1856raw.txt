here comes pippi longstocking , with a hey , and a skip ...
cut it out , mom .
did you ever sleep with ramon ?
no , why are you asking me that ?
how are molly and isak ?
they' re all right .
you know , ninni , i' m very ... ... very , very proud of you .
i wish i was more like you .
more like you ...
dogface !
dogface .
come here !
mom , isak took my game !
i had it first !
if you' re going to fight , i' il take it .
isak is a jerk .
i' m not , you fucking idiot .
don' t swear , isak .
buckle up .
but you and dad swear .
you can swear when you' re adults too .
falllng beauty
after all , for the past ten years we' ve managed every payment .
only now when the wiring needed replacing ... ... and i' ve had less work than usual ...
perhaps you need to review your entire situation .
it would make more financial sense to have a smaller house .
maybe you should consider it .
our choice of home is ours , thanks .
it would be very good if you gave us this opportunity .
my suggestion is to grant you more time to pay your debts , until the 1st of august .
will you be able to manage that ?
of course .
i want a zelda windwaker .
you can get a second hand one .
yeah , when all my friends don' t play it anymore .
there they are . ... grateful to pay through the nose !
if you think you can act like that at a bank , you' re dumber than i thought .
i' m telling you , we' re not going to crawl in the dirt and die alive .
everybody fucking dies alive .
some people never start living .
complaining !
if you could just say something useful for once !
hi .
hello .
oh ...
hi !
hi there , ekborg .
hi there , bergendahl .
how are things ?
okay ...
you' re certainly hot right now .
sometimes it' s up , sometimes it' s down .
how about you ?
the tv series went off the air , right ?
that happened about a year ago .
things have been kind of ...
it' il be fine , but if you hear anything , give me a call .
of course .
you too .
we' re having a midsummer party .
well , midsummer' s kind of ...
lia' s the one who knows about the holidays .
i' il call you .
take care !
say hi to lia .
i will .
oh , i' m sorry .
how are you doing , your family ?
we' re all fine .
good .
we' il be in touch .
fine " ...
fucking fine !
get in , we' re going home now .
i' d like to take a picture .
please , ninni , take it today .
i' m not in the mood ...
how did it go ?
absolutely great !
we have to pay the debt , or we' re out on the street .
couldn' t we sell our house and find a smaller place ?
could you be quiet ?
i want to have a hamburger .
not today .
why not ?
we don' t have money for burgers .
i want a hamburger !
hamburger , hamburger , hamburger ...
stop it , or i' il turn you into a hamburger !
slow down !
i' m not going fast .
we' il make hamburgers at home .
money' s kind of tight right now .
homemade burgers suck .
i feel sick ...
would you slow down !
that' s enough , isak .
your party' s going to cost a lot .
it' il be fun for you too .
it' s still true .
parties are better than regular days .
hamburger , hamburger , hamburger ...
shut up !
basta !
talk about typical midsummer weather !
that guy is going to stay in the hunting cabin near by your house .
why ?
maybe he likes it when nothing much happens .
if you pick seven different kinds of flowers on midsummer eve , and put them under your pillow , you' il dream about your intended .
the person you' re going to marry .
the love of your life .
i' m going to marry you , ninni .
we' re going to be lesbians .
what ?
the toilet' s clogged .
the tank hasn' t been emptied , has it ?
so we' il use the outhouse .
the outhouse ? !
this is a party !
everything will be fine .
everything will be fine , mom .
i' m sure it will .
i' m not going to move out of this house , you hear ?
at least not until we get some decent tri chamber sewage put in .
oh , mom ...
little froggies , little froggies , they' re comical to see
little froggies , little froggies they' re comical to see
no ears , no ears , no tails ' a hanging free ...
eat , drink and be merry !
let' s do " song of summer " !
ninni , that was the summer you were conceived ...
should anyone feel we' ve had enough to drink
anyone at the table who' s had their fill ...
their singing makes me feel sick ...
who' s that ?
oh , right ...
that guy' s staying at the cabin .
i gave him a lift .
he' s never celebrated midsummer before , so i invited him to join us .
could everybody please listen ?
where can ramon sit ?
here .
what' s his name again ?
ramon .
some aquavit ...
take it easy .
hey , isak , shoot at the target and that' s it .
point the gun at anyone else , and i' il take it away from you .
how are things with you and jorgen ?
how should i put this ...
that old rose bush over there sees more action than mine .
no , things are kind of iffy .
ninni , how do you say " lagom " in english ?
i don' t know .
what about a new mortgage ?
the bank turned us down .
so do some commercials .
i haven' t exactly been turning down any kind of work for quite a while .
i' m sorry , but if we don' t leave now , she just won' t sleep .
bye !
it was a lovely party , really lovely .
mom ?
hey , mom , why did you take off ?
i was feeling sad .
yeah ?
when i was your age , ninni ...
i thought ...
i thought things would ...
i figured someone would come along and make things right .
like when i was expecting you .
we had no place to live , and no money either .
christ , i was just a baby myself .
now ... everyone' s become so boring .
they talk about boring things .
you' re drunk , that' s why you see things that way .
you' re boring too .
oh , ninni , i didn' t mean that .
i' m sorry , sweetheart .
no problem .
it' s all right , mom .
i' il go back ...
i' il go back to the others soon .
you go ahead , honey .
promise me you' il be back ?
i' m sorry i said those awful things last night .
no problem .
want me to help you clean up ?
i' m going out for groceries , want to come along ?
no ...
may i be excused ?
that was way out of line .
what ?
you know , doing that striptease .
what' s the guy supposed to think ?
that your wife is horny ?
tiresome , you mean .
you wouldn' t dare .
what do you mean ?
rob a bank .
you want me to rob a bank ?
actually , i do .
show you have the balls .
that would be nice .
anything ...
i would do anything .
don' t wreck it !
it' s my turn ...
hi , was the water nice ?
yeah , it was great .
time to go ...
i saw you and ramon over by the tree .
i don' t think he' s ... the right kind of company for you .
don' t tell me , tell him .
is he the right kind of company for you and mom ?
what' s up with you and him ?
what do you mean ?
welcome to the children' s hotline .
hi , my name is ninni .
i' m 16 .
is there anything particular you' d like to talk about ?
my parents are planning to do something illegal .
rob a bank , i think .
oh ...
are you sure ?
many adults fantasize about things they wouldn' t actually do .
they' re kind of different .
well , if this is true ...
you aren' t the right person to stop them .
then who is ?
hi .
you just went to the bank .
this time we' re seeing the top dog .
i don' t need a baby sitter .
neither do i.
do i have a choice ?
no .
all right , i' il baby sit .
the bank robbers take their own cars to the parking lot .
they switch to the getaway car .
and stop here , by the bank .
the alarm will go off .
and the police will come .
but since the robbers are so darn good ...
the police will stay on their tail .
no , they' il switch cars .
daddy showed me how to play cops and robbers .
how did it go ?
we didn' t get much .
see you .
that sure took a while !
where is ramon ?
i dropped him off at his place .
we got stuck in a roadblock .
he' il be here for dinner .
what happened ? !
they weren' t looking for a car with a man and a woman in it .
just like we thought .
how did it feel ?
let' s go into the kitchen , molly .
what are they doing ?
they' re fighting ... maybe .
come on .
what happened at the bank ?
we couldn' t see the manager , so we' il have to go back .
shit , i' ve got to go to work .
i' il take you .
are you going to fight some more ?
no , molly , we' re not going to fight .
at least not for a while .
the food was great , thanks .
what are you doing ?
it sounded like you were talking to someone .
i guess i was talking to myself .
you weren' t smoking , were you ?
no , dad .
now just go .
knock next time .
hi .
what' s that ?
a registered letter .
what does that mean ?
your parents have to sign it .
how are you ?
fine , how about you ?
i don' t know .
things are kind of weird .
hi .
see you .
see you .
bye .
bye , ninni .
jorgen .
well aren' t you dressed up ...
i' m going to stockholm .
what ?
tina and i are going to the amusement park .
you' il have to bring the kids along .
no way !
we' re spending the night with a friend of tina' s .
i won' t do it .
we need a sitter , comprendes ?
take care of your own kids , god damn it !
watch your language !
i' m not taking them along .
could i have a ride ?
tina' s already in stockholm .
bye !
how about a hamburger ?
yes !
then you can tell me where that store with the video games is .
what are we waiting for ?
let' s go !
hi .
hi .
here' s our receipt , we' ve paid the debt .
the sum total of 18, 730 kronor .
the works .
tutti frutti !
i' m sorry , but it' s too late .
didn' t you get my letter ?
what ... ?
we' re foreclosing , you' il have to pay in full within 60 days .
i don' t understand .
you told us the deadline was the first of august .
you didn' t inform me at the time of your other outstanding debts .
may i ask where the money came from ?
our friends lent it to us ...
does it matter ?
it shows that your overall situation hasn' t really improved .
first you tell us to pay what we owe .
then it' s not good enough .
i' m sorry ...
now listen to me , you little cunt !
you aren' t the least bit sorry !
i' d like you to leave .
shafting us turns you on .
know what , molly and isak ?
you should be proud of your dad .
what are you doing ?
we' re going camping , remember ?
we' re going to do something together .
ramon' s back , by the way .
he' il be going with us .
he' s right behind you , mom .
hi .
go pack your things .
how are you doing , mom ?
come on , everybody look this way ...
into the camera .
nice night .
yes , and the day was nice too .
i' il go read molly a bedtime story .
have you asked him ?
no , not yet .
if you can' t take the heat , stay out of the kitchen .
what was that ?
quiet !
i heard everything you said .
like what ?
i could hear everything .
have you had a bad dream ?
i know what you' re up to .
and i' m not going to accept it .
we haven' t asked for your opinion , ninni .
this is totally crazy !
if you get caught , i' m the one who gets hurt .
along with molly and isak .
who says we' il get caught ?
dad , you' ve always been there for me , don' t change that .
everything we do , we do for you .
don' t you know that ?
when i was your age i' d moved from place to place with a lot of different jerks my mom met in lousy bars .
dad and i wanted you to have a place to call home .
but you' re all so fucking spoiled and take things for granted .
damn it !
dad ?
your mother and i made this decision together .
i' m going to call the cops .
go to bed .
he' s going to back out of it .
we' il do it ourselves .
just the two of us .
we' il modify the plan .
forget it .
we' re going away for a while .
ninni .
listen ...
i' m leaving .
i know ...
what the ... ?
cool it .
it will be all right .
what time is it ?
15 .
it' s locked .
it will probably take the police in eskilstuna at least 20 minutes .
let' s do it .
hi .
nice wig , what' s up ?
it' s a practical joke .
a practical joke ?
i' il tell you later .
somebody getting married ?
no ...
i' il tell you later .
why the hell did you move the car ?
because i had to !
step on it !
is that guy following us ?
where ?
that car ?
i don' t know .
there are two passengers ...
a guy and a kid .
gee , aren' t we the lucky ones !
don' t worry , i' il lose him .
i' il make a left turn here .
floor it !
he' s gone .
really ?
oh , christ !
shit , isn' t that the car that was following us ?
i don' t know .
it could be ...
we' ve got to go .
we' ve got to leave .
christ , he is following us .
he' s following us !
stop shouting !
calm down !
jorgen , this is a dead end !
stop shouting , damn it !
fucking lousy car ...
what' s he doing now ?
he' s still right on our tail .
what a moron , chasing bank robbers with a kid in the car .
there are lots of morons around .
helena !
think he got our license plate no . ?
probably .
what do we do now ?
i' ve reported our car as stolen and i left it over at ramtorp .
the bag of money' s up in that big oak tree over by the bend .
i think they were injured .
we' ve got to keep our mouths shut .
if we' re arrested and the police say that one of us has confessed , they' re lying .
in this country it' s hard to convict anyone on circumstantial evidence .
especially people like us .
so , we have to shut up .
for the children' s sake .
okay .
i' il get it .
hello ?
no , she' s not in .
i don' t know when she' il be back .
bye .
ninni , call the police .
love , helena and jorgen
oh , ninni , you' re so grown up .
we were in the neighborhood , so we dropped by .
hi , i' m lia .
this is a great place .
you' re too late .
i mean , mom and dad ...
i don' t know ...
i don' t know when they' il be back .
has something happened ?
is this a bad time ?
probably .
i never lie .
then explain why the money was found up a tree in your yard ?
i can' t explain that .
can' t you stay with someone ?
like your grandparents ?
my dad' s mom is dead and ...
no , it' s not possible .
i want us to be together .
i understand .
but isak and molly will have to stay at a care center at first .
that' s the best i can do .
that' s pretty .
you can have it .
thank you .
what' s that ?
bars .
jails aren' t very pretty , so i added lots of flowers .
shut up , you idiot .
don' t say that , isak .
somebody at the bank claims they recognized my voice from tv .
funny , isn' t it ?
not really .
no ...
well , it' s not evidence .
time to go .
don' t you want my drawing ?
hi .
come on in .
how are you ?
fine .
i' ve been thinking , you could stay here for a while .
but we only have one bedroom .
we can stay at the house .
the bank is selling it .
as of saturday .
didn' t you know ?
no .
there' il be some money from the sale , you could buy a new place .
i' il have to talk to the bank .
oh , honey ...
i' m sorry .
i' m going to go see mom in an hour or so , on top of it all .
i' il be back in an hour .
hello , ninni .
hello , mom .
i' m going to interview you .
why ?
all right ...
listen , ninni ...
could you film the house before it' s sold ?
here comes pippi longstocking ...
cut it out , mom .
tell me what it was like growing up with my grandmother .
well , you know ...
drunks always tell lies .
they lie to themselves and to others .
they run out on you , they' re not there for you .
why don' t i ever get to see her ?
i only remember meeting her twice , when i was just little kid .
we had a deal , she could only see you when she was sober .
see you later , alligator .
i didn' t want you to be subjected to that kind of crap .
did you ever sleep with ramon ?
no , why are you asking me that ?
how are molly and isak ?
they' re doing all right .
you know what , ninni ?
i' m very , very proud of you .
i wish i was a bit more like you ...
more like you .
we' ve got to go now .
no , you can' t go !
we have to .
no !
i' m going with you .
i' m going try to bring you home .
promise ?
yes , i promise .
now you come here and say you' re going to be a big hero ...
do i even exist ?
rosie ...
ramon told me he committed the robbery .
he wants to take the blame .
the police might not believe me , but if you tell them ...
listen , i saw helena downtown right before the robbery .
she was wearing a wig and waiting in a car i didn' t recognize .
don' t worry , i haven' t told anyone .
you' re talking about perjury .
he' s going to leave the country .
there won' t be a trial .
and you' il never see him again .
don' t say that .
what a mess .
they' re such fucking idiots .
okay .
but i' m doing it for you , and for molly and isak .
gracias .
goodbye .
hi , mom .
this is the last day , tomorrow the movers will be here .
you wanted me to film the house , and i wanted to say a few words too .
i won' t tell dad about you and ramon .
i' ve been thinking about that , and about what you said about grandma ...
well , everything felt hopeless .
then i got angry .
how long do molly , isak , dad and i have to suffer because she drank ?
isn' t it about time you stopped feeling sorry for yourself ?
cleaned up your own act ?
mommy !
oh , molly ...
hi , isak !
hello there , big guy !
the house is great .
yes ?
want to see my room ?
i' d love to see it .
