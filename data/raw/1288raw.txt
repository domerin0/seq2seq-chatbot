okay .
so this and my other factory , i can guarantee production ... of 200 kilos refined every month of the year .
the problem is i have no steady market .
basically , what i' m looking for is somebody in the states ... who can share the risk with me , somebody who can guarantee to buy from me , say , 150 kilos a month .
oh !
that' s a big commitment , mr. sosa .
something like that , uh
it' s too bad frank' s not here .
you should talk to him .
it would' ve been nice if he could have come .
he would like to come , but with his trial coming up , it' s hard for him to get out of the country .
so he sent you instead ?
yeah , something like that .
we' il talk at my house , shall we ?
you got good stuff here .
class ' a ' shit .
so this lpez guarantees to buy from me 150 kilos every month of the year .
he picks it up here .
i can sell it to him for as little as , uh ... 7, 000 a key .
you cannot do better than that .
yeah , but then we gotta take the risk of moving it .
also , we' il be cutting out the colombians .
you know what that means ?
that means we have to go to war with them .
we cut out the colombians , we take risks on both sides .
why don' t we split the risk ?
you guarantee your delivery , say , as far as panama .
we take it from there .
panama is risky .
it costs me more .
panama i can sell for ... 13 . 5 a key .
13 . 5 ?
what , are you nuts ?
13 . 5 ?
we still gotta take that shit to florida , man .
do you know what that' s like these days ?
you got the fucking navy .
you got frogmen .
you got ec 2s with the satellite tracking shit .
you got the fucking bell 209 assault choppers up the ass .
we' re losing one out of every nine loads .
that' s no duck walk anymore , man , let me tell you .
forget about 13 . 5 .
well , what do you suggest that is reasonable ?
excuse me one moment .
hey , montana , what the fuck' s the matter with you ?
you negotiating for frank lpez , huh ?
don' t worry about it .
take it easy .
i' m not worried about it .
you should worry about it . lf he wants to make a deal , it' s up to him , not you .
we' re gonna do this one deal .
that' s it .
fuck you .
how' s that ?
fuck you .
fuck you .
you need to open your eyes and keep your mouth shut .
that' s it .
let it go at that .
don' t worry about it .
your head is in the wrong place .
you got to watch out for yourself .
why don' t you talk to him about it ?
you think he wants to give you the money ?
shut the fuck up .
i' m doing the talking here , not you .
you' re here to watch my back .
watch my back .
better than your front , let me tell you .
that' s easier to watch .
close your mouth .
i can' t wait to see what frank' s gonna react to this one .
just shut up .
i' m doing the talking here .
now where were we ?
panama .
you' re looking for a partner , right ?
something like that .
look , mr. sosa , we' re getting ahead of ourselves here .
i am down on frank' s authority to buy 200 keys , that' s it .
that' s my limit .
i got no right
nobody got no right to negotiate for frank  let the man finish , okay ?
let him propose a proposition ; then we can talk more .
you got no authority here .
i started you in this fucking business , so shut the fuck up .
frank is gonna love it .
don' t worry about it .
that' s up to frank , not you !
i' m sorry about this , mr. sosa .
no , it is all right .
you' re right .
maybe you should talk to frank .
well , good .
i don' t think it' s something i wanna do on an overseas phone .
but as soon as i get back to miami , i will talk to frank personally .
good .
my associates here can escort you to my chopper .
my chopper can take you to santa cruz .
i have a jet there , can have you in miami in five hours .
you should be back here tomorrow in time for lunch .
good .
good .
good .
good .
good .
good .
hasta maana .
good talking to you .
why don' t you leave your friend here ?
while you are gone , maybe he can tell me how to run my business .
i think frank would like to see him  no , that' s okay .
you tell frank i keeping this guy on ice for him .
i guess so .
let' s finish our lunch .
i have to hand it to you , mr. sosa .
you got everything a man could want .
i like you , tony .
there is no lying in you .
unfortunately , i do not feel the same about the rest of your organization .
what do you mean by that , mr. sosa ?
i' m talking about omar surez .
this garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch ...
from several years ago in new york .
he was an informer for the police .
he put vito duval and the ramos brothers , nello and gino , away for life .
so how do i know you' re not a chivato too , tony ?
hey , sosa .
let' s get this straight now .
i never fucked anybody over in my life didn' t have it comin ' to him .
you got that ?
all i have in this life is my balls and my word , and i don' t break ' em for no one , you understand ?
that piece of shit up there , i never like him , i never trusted him .
for all i know , he had me set up and had my friend , ngel fernndez , killed .
but that' s history .
i' m here , he' s not .
you wanna go on with me , say it .
you don' t , then you make a move .
i think you speak from the heart , montana .
but i say to myself , this lpez , your boss , he had chivatos like that working for him .
his judgment stinks .
so i think to myself , how many other mistakes has this lpez guy made ?
how can i trust his organization ?
you tell me , tony .
frank is smart , you know ?
you can' t blame him for that animal .
it' s a crazy business we' re in , you know ?
that could happen to anyone , even you .
why don' t i go back and talk to frank ... and work it out ?
i fix things between us .
you got my word on it .
i think you and me , we can work this thing out , we do business together a long time .
just remember i' il only tell you one time don' t fuck me , tony .
don' t you ever try to fuck me .
you what ?
you made a deal for a fucking $18 million ... without even checking with me ?
are you crazy , montana ?
are you crazy ?
coo , frank .
take it easy .  coo , my ass !
at 10 . 5 a key , it' s puro .
you can' t lose money .
no way .
we make 75 million on this deal , frank .
seventy five million .
that is serious money .
what the fuck is sosa going to do when i don' t come up with the first five million ?
what is he gonna do ?
ls he gonna send me a bill ?
he' s gonna send a fucking hit squad up here !
relax !
take it easy .
i' m in tight with sosa .

like your friend sosa .
let me tell you something about that greaseball cocksucker .
he is a snake , that' s what he is .
you turn your back on him , he' il stick it in .
you don' t trust a guy like that .
you want me to believe ...
omar was a stoolie because sosa said so ?
you bought that line .
maybe i made a mistake sending you down there .
maybe you and sosa know something i don' t know .
like what ?
like what ?
you tell me like what ?
you calling me a liar , frank ?
that what you calling me ?
let' s just say i want things to stay the way they are for now .

i want you to meet some of my friends .
this is pedro quinn , chairman of the andes sugar corporation .
pleasure meeting you , mr. montana .
nice to meet you .
general edward strasser , commander of the first army corps .
tony montana .
mucho gusto , amigo .
pleasure .
this is ariel bleyer with the ministry of the lnterior here .
tony montana .
bienvenido .
and here is our friend , charles goodson from washington .
this is tony montana .
how do you do ?
how do you do , mr. montana ?
sit here , tony .
gentlemen .
i would like to discuss something that is of interest to all of us here .
you have a problem , tony .
we ... have a problem .
i think together we can solve all our problems .
we all know that you have tax troubles in your country ... and that you may have to do a little time .
but we have some friends in washington that assure us these troubles can be taken care of .
you may have to pay some back taxes , a big fine , but , uh , there will be no prison .
okay .
so what' s your problem , alex ?
i' il show you my problem .
i' ve heard whispers about financial support your government receives ... from the drug industry in bolivia .
well , the irony of this is that this money , which is in the billions , is coming from your country .
you are the major purchaser of our national product , which is cocaine .
on one hand you' re saying the united states government ... is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets .
at the same time , we are doing business with the same government ... that is flooding our streets with cocaine .
s .
let me show you a few of the other characters ... that are involved in this tragicomedy .
my organization just recently traced a large purchase ... by this man .
this charming face here belongs to general cucombre .
he is the minister of the defense of bolivia , my country .
and general cucombre just a couple of months ago ... bought a $12 million villa on lake lucerne in switzerland .
now , if cucombre is supposed to be the bolivian defense minister , what is he doing living in switzerland , guarding cash registers ?
this man here ,
alejandro sosa , a very interesting character .
he' s a wealthy landowner , educated in england , very good family .
but this man is the business brain and drug overlord ... of an empire that stretches across the andes .
he' s not your ordinary drug dealer .
well , discussing it openly [ tape stops ]
he is scheduled for 60 minutes next .
he is going on french , british , ltalian ,
japanese television .
people everywhere are starting to listen to him .
it' s embarrassing , tony .
yeah .
that is our problem .
you remember alberto , don' t you ?
how could i forget him ?
alberto is an expert in the disposal business .
he' s going to help us fix our problem .
but he doesn' t speak english .
he doesn' t know his way around the states too well .
he needs a little help .
ls that a problem , tony ?
no problem .
good .
so what' s the big mystery with the bolivian situation ?
you gonna tell me what happened with sosa or what ?
a lotta bullshit , that what happened .
politics .
okay .
i want you to stay down here for a while .
run things for me .
i gotta go to new york next week .
okay ?
fuck this , man .
i don' t like it , man .
i don' t like this at all .
you don' t like it ?
okay .
you the one that got me into this mess in the first place , you know that ?
oh , yeah ?
with that fuckin ' seidelbaum , that right ?
with seidelbaum ?
man , what does seidelbaum have to do with sosa ?
how you connect those two ?
why don' t you eat your food ?
what' s wrong with it ?
i' m not hungry .
you' re not hungry ?

what did you order it for then ?
