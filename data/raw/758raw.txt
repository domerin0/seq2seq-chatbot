oh , mr president, things are more complicated than that .

well , if you tried to make a name for yourself in gulf , you wouldn' t start off by ...
wow, nice shot . ... challenging tiger woods .

same as politics .
you don' t start political career by running against former president of united states .
fine .
fine ?
it' s a privilege to run , it' s a privliege to withdraw .
all settled .

sally . is it me or did you just get it by the president guy .
yes , i think i did .
how could he choose from us
and, is it me or did you just say " yes" to the president guy ?
yes , i think i did
look , sally , i' m sorry that i was late .
ok, but you can' t take the president because of that .
did you really think that is the reason ?
why ? then .
my heart
use this
shut up !
sally , i want to talk to you .
sally . i want to talk !
mr president
yes, handy, what it is ?
mr president
thank you very much
i can' t do it . i can' t draw back from the mayor race
excuse me ?
i ... don' t have the eagle things like you , but i' m a man of my word too .
and every man' s word is important is it natural ?
does he want money ?
otherwise what is it
if you stay in the race, i' m sure you' re going to score off me . but ...
i' m running for the mayor of mooseport
ya ... hoo !
he' s loosing his money ?
what' s just happened ?
you are running against the president
and your girl friend ditchs you .
ur hum .
i repeat . ur hum !
no , the president has no comment .
no, no comment . thank you .
that' s all network' s
the handyman' s girl friend ?
his girl friend ? why didn' t you tell me
i won' t look like a idot
i tried to tell you mr president .
remember ?
why didn' t you try harder ?
what must i to do now ?
appologize ? backdown ?
you want to call bert langdon ?
for what ? i don' t need a campaign manger for this .
hello , one second .
mr president . bert langdon on line 1
bert, what a coincident .
oh, well, that' s what i gonna ask you .
eagle
it' s dead mission i' m here . i' il be happy to roll up my sleeves and come up there if you want .
bert , i' m running against my plumber .
is there something i don' t know ?
you watching fox news ?
the results are quite interesting .
the poll of course is preliminary, but it does harrison was surprising strong .
there are 8 % margin error and it' s still early .
but it looks to be very close .
seems to me that president has got himself a good horse race .
eagle, you with me ?
don' t you mean " lose race " ?
eagle, hey !
oh hu oh !
are you sally mannis .
yeah could i ask a question about handy harrison .
are you now dating the president ?
no, i' m dating the president .
it' s one date .
and i' m even not sure you should call it a " date
you don' t call it a " date " ?
what would you call it exactly ?
can you answer us a couple of questions ?
we won' t ask you hours
have you and the president had sex yet ?
who got sex !
think about it handy .
our mayor , we could have the president of the united states !
what are you trying to tell us ?
come on, guys .
you know he' s going to win
you' re bad . you bastard !
come on .
thank you reuben
and you' d better keep an eye .
you' re bananas , harrison
handy, handy ...
what' s this, come on !
what' s going on ?
what' s it look like ?
your campaigner !
handy, handy guys, come on .
hey, handy . do you like it there ?
oh, that' s ... yeah .
guys , thank you very much in the moo' s head and everything .
but irma . we disgust this .
i' m not compaigning . i' m not .
what ?
do you care about sally or not
look, her going out with him , it' s ... just a kind of ...
call a postman a parcle in two vasion . it' s just my opinion .
lose the election, lose sally .
is that going to go anywhere, ok ?
he' s like 20 years older than me .
he is a president
so
power takes 10 years off a man handy .
rich , another 10 .
by timing you figure he' s in great shape, you are not .
he is younger than you are .
so, you want a campaign or not ?
better shape
i know i can kick your ass .
how do we keep this thing offerd ? obviously it' s to keep him presidential
just pound these mooseporters, what his unbelievable experience can bring to them .
look at it, think about for half an second .
harrison can' t bring even a function what he brings .
what ever he is .
and what excatly is he preliminary research said he is something that actually we have never faced before , mr president ?
and that is ?
he is generally honest man, sir
come on , grace . all that means he has never run for public office
what you got ?
bert
fbl, cla, nothing
and this turned up in a local paper and ... that' s it .
that' s it ?
we' re running against a pie eating champinon ?
but think about this
he runs for mayor, but only when he think he is on the post .
he dates the same woman for 6 years , but he never pops the question .
what' s wrong with the picture ?
he won' t take risks
he won' t make commandment
and any man who won' t make a commandment shouldn' t be a mayor or anything .
that' s good , how could we get it out ? whisper campaign first , then radio, and eventually, we' il have to have some tv surport .
shouldn' t get too expensive, but ..
mr president, i' m sure you don' t want to hear this .
but would the easiest thing be ...
should we discuss our withdraw ?
withdraw ?
grace . he is the eagle
eagle cole has never run away from anything in his life .
now imagine what we' il do with finances finances
book deals, quarter board, library fund raising , you quit , you quit, got help us lose to promote we can' t keep so still and say goodbye fast you can see a road roller .
mr president, this is not about mooseport , it is about winning !
it' s about spending 3 million dollars to protect 20 .
maybe i should come and speak to her .
i ... i canceled that sir .
you .. what ?
it ... seems obvious we are right in the middle of campagin .
it was millions of dollars .
well , sir, there is still that offer from the super motor' s people
bullard, the ex president of united states can not do car commercial .
oh, have you seen the car , mr president
look at this, it' s steepy style . and snappy president . and ...
bullard smooth head line, leathering steering ..
bullard !
get out ! get out !
i' il handle the money, eagle .
i' m sure there will be library pledgers something will turn up .
may i sit down , sir ?
go in the corner, out of my eyeline
thank you sir
i can still see you .
yes , sir .
what about the girl ?
what about sally handy, sally eagle .
he' il have to cancel the date .
wow, no, he can' t cancel the date .
you said that, bert . the eagle doesn' t back down .
you clear up what i didn' t know, when i didn' t know it . i will be fine .
shall i tell the press list , mr president .
yeah , oh , no, no .
call the press, have more over here in the morning, and get handy harrison here to fix the toilet .
you see what i' m going with this , do i have to draw you a picture .
i see , mr president, am i ?
let' s get to work come in
let' s go, let' s go . move on through .
move on home .
looks like at airport .
handy, what are you going to do ?
good morning , handy good morning, mr president, you got toilet trouble, right ?
handy, ah . i want to make it clear that when i asked miss mannis out, i have no idea that you two have relationship
and even though i found it reprehensible for any man in the experience i' m going romance me too
i also believe that woman' s heart is hers and hers alone to give .
ah, it' s a good point
so, i asked sally out in ignorance and she agreed to go
until she tells me she stands down , i intend to see her, there .
call him howling dog !
what did she say ?
howling dog ?
well ... if it' s ok with you, sir , let' s chew on that i bet ok
ok , you chew on that , and ... if you find that you can' t swallow it, you let me know and i' il give you the hand lock, and over , ok ?
go on in there and fix the toilet .
so , we' re going to see your date , mr president .
i don' t know what you' il see .
thank you so much , thank you
oh , it' s great mood, do we have any ice cream ?
absolutely, sir .
and i think we find the way to solve the money problems .

hi, handy
i just want to say one thing
i' m a little embarrassed about the way i have been running my campagin .

sallyif you watching this ,
i was wrong to bring our relationship been to this .
i' m sorry
oh ... i guess i did it again , i just brought our relationship been to it again .

i guess, what i want to say, folks, i thik an election should be about the town .
it should be about what we need and how we can work together to get things done .
the president can do great things for us
son of bitch
having him as a mayorthat' s an oppounity we can' t pass off .
tomorrow morning, i' m going to the polls , i' il cast my vote for the president .

a man who was stood to anything to win a position he doesn' t even want .
