i should' ve known that you would be here , professor mcgonagall .
good evening , professor dumbledore .
are the rumors true , albus ?
i' m afraid so , professor .
the good and the bad .
and the boy ?
hagrid is bringing him .
is it wise to trust hagrid with something so important ?
professor , i would trust hagrid with my life .
professor dumbledore , sir .
professor mcgonagall .
no problems , i trust , hagrid ?
no , sir .
little tyke fell asleep as we were flying over bristol .
try not to wake him .
there you go .
do you really think it' s safe , leaving him with these people ?
i' ve watched them all day .
they' re the worst sort of muggles .
they really are  the only family he has .
he' il be famous .
every child in our world will know his name .
exactly .
he' s far better off growing up away from all of that .
until he' s ready .
there , there , hagrid .
it' s not really goodbye , after all .
good luck ... ... harry potter .
up .
get up !
now !
wake up , cousin !
we' re going to the zoo !
here he comes , the birthday boy .
happy birthday , son .
cook breakfast .
and try not to burn anything .
yes , aunt petunia .
i want everything to be perfect ... ... for my dudley' s special day !
hurry up !
bring my coffee , boy .
yes , uncle vernon .
aren' t they wonderful , darling ?
how many are there ?
36 .
counted them myself .
36 ? !
but last year i had 37 !
but some are bigger than last year' s .
i don' t care !
this is what we' re going to do .
we' re going to buy you two new presents .
how' s that , pumpkin ?
it should be a lovely day at the zoo .
i' m really looking forward to it .
i' m warning you now , boy .
any funny business , any at all ... ... and you won' t have any meals for a week .
get in .
make it move .
move !
move !
he' s asleep !
he' s boring .
sorry about him .
he doesn' t understand what it' s like , lying there ... ... watching people press their ugly faces in on you .
can you hear me ?
it' s just , i' ve never talked to a snake before .
do you ... ?
do you talk to people often ?
you' re from burma , aren' t you ?
was it nice there ?
do you miss your family ?
i see .
that' s me as well .
i never knew my parents either .
mummy , dad , you won' t believe what this snake is doing !
thanks .
anytime .
snake !
mum !
mummy !
help me !
my darling boy !
how did you get in there ?
who did this ?
how did you get in there ?
is there a snake ?
it' s all right , sweetheart .
we' il get you out of these cold clothes .
what happened ?
i swear , i don' t know !
the glass was there and then it was gone , like magic .
there' s no such thing as magic .
marge is ill .
ate a funny whelk .
dad , look !
harry' s got a letter !
it' s mine !
yours ?
who' d be writing to you ?
no more mail through this letterbox .
have a lovely day at the office , dear .
shoo !
go on .
fine day , sunday .
in my opinion , best day of the week .
why is that , dudley ?
because there' s no post on sundays ?
right you are , harry !
no post on sunday .
no blasted letters today !
no , sir .
not one single bloody letter .
not one !
no , sir , not one blasted , miserable
make it stop , please !
stop it !
mummy , what' s happening ?
give me that !
give me that letter !
get off !
they' re my letters !
let go of me !
that' s it !
we' re going away !
far away , where they can' t find us !
daddy' s gone mad , hasn' t he ?
make a wish , harry .
who' s there ?
sorry about that .
i demand that you leave at once .
you are breaking and entering .
dry up , dursley , you great prune .
i haven' t seen you since you was a baby , harry .
you' re a bit more along than i expected .
particularly in the middle .
i' m not harry .
i am .
well , of course you are .
got something for you .
afraid i sat on it , but i imagine it' il taste fine just the same .
baked it myself , words and all .
thank you .
it' s not every day your young man turns 1 1 , is it ?
excuse me , but who are you ?
rubeus hagrid , keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts .
of course , you know about hogwarts .
sorry , no .
didn' t you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all ?
learned what ?
you' re a wizard , harry .
i' m a what ?
a wizard .
a good one , i' d wager , once you' re trained up .
no , you' ve made a mistake .
i mean ... ... i can' t be a wizard .
i mean , i' m just harry .
just harry .
well , just harry , did you ever make anything happen ?
anything you couldn' t explain , when you were angry or scared ?
dear mr. potter , we are pleased to accept you ... ... at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry .
he will not be going !
we swore we' d put a stop to all this rubbish .
you knew ?
you knew all along and you never told me ?
of course we knew .
how could you not be ?
my perfect sister being who she was .
my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter .
we have a witch in the family .
isn' t it wonderful ?
i was the only one to see her for what she was .
a freak !
then she met that potter , and then she had you ... ... and i knew you would be the same .
just as strange , just as abnormal .
and then she got herself blown up , and we got landed with you .
blown up ?
you told me my parents died in a car crash .
a car crash ?
a car crash killed lily and james potter ?
we had to say something .
it' s an outrage !
a scandal !
he' il not be going .
a great muggle like you is going to stop him ?
muggle ?
non magic folk .
this boy' s had his name down since he were born .
he' s going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry .
he' il be under the finest headmaster hogwarts has seen , albus dumbledore .
i will not pay to have a crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks .
never insult albus dumbledore ... ... in front of me .
i' d appreciate it if you didn' t tell anyone at hogwarts about that .
i' m not allowed to do magic .
okay .
we' re a bit behind schedule .
best be off .
unless you' d rather stay , of course .
all students must be equipped with ... ... one standard size 2 pewter cauldron ... ... and may bring , if they desire , either an owl , a cat or a toad .
can we find all this in london ?
if you know where to go .
ah , hagrid !
the usual , i presume ?
no , thanks , tom .
i' m on official hogwarts business .
just helping harry buy his school supplies .
bless my soul .
it' s harry potter !
welcome back , mr. potter .
welcome back .
doris crockford .
i can' t believe i' m meeting you at last .
harry potter .
can' t tell you how pleased i am to meet you .
hello , professor .
i didn' t see you .
professor quirrell will be your defense against the dark arts teacher .
oh , nice to meet you .
fearfully fascinating subject .
not that you need it , eh , potter ?
yes , well , must be going now .
lots to buy .
goodbye .
see , harry ?
you' re famous .
but why am i famous ?
all those people , how is it they know who i am ?
i' m not sure i' m the right person to tell you that .
welcome , harry , to diagon alley .
here , you get your quills and ink .
over there , all your bits and bobs for doing wizardry .
it' s a world class racing broom .
look at it !
the new nimbus 2000 !
it' s the fastest model yet .
but how am i to pay for all this ?
i haven' t any money .
there' s your money .
gringotts , the wizard bank .
ain' t no safer place , not one .
except perhaps hogwarts .
hagrid , what exactly are these things ?
they' re goblins .
clever as they come , but not the most friendly of beasts .
best stay close .
mr. harry potter wishes to make a withdrawal .
and does mr. harry potter have his key ?
wait a minute .
got it here somewhere .
ha !
there' s the little devil .
and there' s something else as well .
professor dumbledore gave me this .
it' s about you know what in vault you know which .
very well .
vault 687 .
lamp , please .
key , please .
did you think your parents would leave you with nothing ?
vault 71 3 .
what' s in there , hagrid ?
can' t tell you .
hogwarts business .
very secret .
stand back .
best not to mention this to anyone .
i still need a wand .
you want ollivanders .
there ain' t no place better .
run along there and wait .
i got one more thing to do .
hello ?
hello ?
i wondered when i' d be seeing you , mr. potter .
it seems only yesterday ... ... that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands .
here we are .
give it a wave .
apparently not .
perhaps ... ... this .
no , no , definitely not .
no matter .
i wonder ....
curious .
very curious .
sorry , but what' s curious ?
i remember every wand i' ve ever sold , mr. potter .
it so happens that the phoenix ... ... whose tail feather resides in your wand , gave another feather .
just one other .
it is curious that you should be destined for this wand ... ... when its brother gave you that scar .
and who owned that wand ?
we do not speak his name .
the wand chooses the wizard , mr. potter .
it' s not always clear why .
but i think it is clear ... ... that we can expect great things from you .
after all , he who must not be named ... ... did great things .
terrible ... ... yes , but great .
harry !
harry !
happy birthday .
you all right , harry ?
you seem very quiet .
he killed my parents , didn' t he ?
the one who gave me this .
you know , hagrid .
i know you do .
not all wizards are good .
some of them go bad .
a few years ago ... ... there was a wizard who went as bad as you can go .
his name was v
his name was v  maybe if you wrote it down ?
no , i can' t spell it .
all right , voldemort .
voldemort ?
it was dark times , harry .
voldemort started to gather some followers .
brought them over to the dark side .
anyone that stood up to him ended up dead .
your parents fought against him .
but nobody lived once he decided to kill them .
nobody , not one .
except you .
me ?
voldemort tried to kill me ?
yes .
that ain' t no ordinary cut on your forehead , harry .
a mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse , an evil curse .
what happened to v ?
to you know who ?
well , some say he died .
codswallop , in my opinion .
nope , i reckon he' s out there still ... ... too tired to carry on .
but one thing' s certain .
something about you stumped him that night .
that' s why you' re famous .
that' s why everybody knows your name .
you' re the boy who lived .
what are you looking at ?
blimey , is that the time ?
i' m gonna have to leave you .
dumbledore will be wanting his
well , he' il be wanting to see me .
your train leaves in 1 0 minutes .
here' s your ticket .
stick to your ticket , that' s very important .
platform 9 3/ 4 " ?
but , hagrid , there must be a mistake .
this says platform 9 3/ 4 .
there' s no such thing , is there ?
sorry .
excuse me .
excuse me .
on your left .
can you tell me where i might find platform 9 3/ 4 ?
think you' re being funny , do you ?
it' s the same every year , packed with muggles .
muggles ?
platform 9 3/ 4 , this way .
all right , percy , you first .
fred , you next .
he' s not fred , i am .
you call yourself our mother ?
i' m sorry , george .
i' m only joking .
i am fred .
excuse me .
could you tell me how to ... ?
how to get onto the platform ?
not to worry , dear .
it' s ron' s first time to hogwarts as well .
all you do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 1 0 .
best to run if you' re nervous .
good luck .
excuse me .
do you mind ?
everywhere else is full .
not at all .
i' m ron , by the way .
ron weasley .
i' m harry .
harry potter .
so it' s true !
i mean , do you really have the ... ?
the what ?
the scar ?
wicked !
anything off the trolley , dears ?
no , thanks .
i' m all set .
we' il take the lot .
bertie bott' s every flavor beans ?
they mean every flavor .
there' s chocolate and peppermint and also ... ... spinach , liver and tripe .
george sweared he got a booger flavored one once .
are they real frogs ?
it' s a spell .
you want the cards .
each pack' s got a famous witch or wizard .
i' ve got about 500 meself .
watch it !
that' s rotten luck .
they' ve only got one good jump in them .
i' ve got dumbledore !
i got about six of him .
hey , he' s gone !
you can' t expect him to hang around all day , can you ?
this is scabbers .
pathetic , isn' t he ?
a little .
fred gave me a spell to turn him yellow .
want to see ?
yeah .
has anyone seen a toad ?
a boy named neville' s lost one .
no .
oh , are you doing magic ?
let' s see , then .
sunshine , daisies , butter mellow
turn this stupid , fat rat yellow
are you sure that' s a real spell ?
well , it' s not very good , is it ?
i' ve only tried a few simple ones myself ... ... but they' ve all worked for me .
oculus reparo .
that' s better , isn' t it ?
holy cricket , you' re harry potter !
i' m hermione granger .
and you are ... ?
i' m ron weasley .
pleasure .
you two better change into robes .
i expect we' il be arriving soon .
you' ve got dirt on your nose .
did you know ?
just there .
right , then .
first years , this way , please !
come on , first years , don' t be shy .
come on now , hurry up .
hello , harry .
hi , hagrid .
right , then .
this way to the boats .
come on now , follow me .
wicked .
welcome to hogwarts .
shortly , you' il pass through these doors and join your classmates .
but before you take your seats , you must be sorted into your houses .
they are gryffindor , hufflepuff ... ... ravenclaw and slytherin .
while you' re here , your house will be like your family .
your triumphs will earn you points .
any rule breaking and you will lose points .
at the end of the year , the house with the most points wins the house cup .
trevor !
sorry .
the sorting ceremony will begin momentarily .
it' s true then , what they' re saying on the train .
harry potter has come to hogwarts .
harry potter ?
this is crabbe and goyle .
and i' m malfoy .
draco malfoy .
think my name' s funny , do you ?
i' ve no need to ask yours .
red hair and a hand me down robe ?
you must be a weasley .
you' il find out some wizarding families are better than others .
you don' t want to go making friends with the wrong sort .
i can help you there .
i think i can tell the wrong sort for myself , thanks .
we' re ready for you now .
follow me .
the ceiling isn' t real .
it' s bewitched to look like the night sky .
i read about it in hogwarts , a history .
will you wait along here , please ?
now , before we begin ... ... professor dumbledore would like to say a few words .
i have a few start of term notices i wish to announce .
the first years , please note ... ... that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students .
also , our caretaker , mr. filch , has asked me to remind you ... ... that the third floor corridor is out of bounds ... ... to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death .
thank you .
when i call your name , you will come forth .
i shall place the sorting hat on your head ... ... and you will be sorted into your houses .
hermione granger .
oh , no .
okay , relax .
mental , that one , i' m telling you .
right , then .
right .
okay .
gryffindor !
draco malfoy .
slytherin !
every wizard who went bad was in slytherin .
susan bones .
harry , what is it ?
nothing .
nothing , i' m fine .
let' s see ....
i know !
hufflepuff !
ronald weasley .
another weasley !
i know just what to do with you .
gryffindor !
harry potter .
difficult , very difficult .
plenty of courage , i see .
not a bad mind , either .
there' s talent , oh , yes .
and a thirst to prove yourself .
but where to put you ?
not slytherin , not slytherin !
not slytherin , eh ?
are you sure ?
you could be great , you know .
it' s all here , in your head .
and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness , no doubt about that .
no ?
well , if you' re sure .
better be ... ... gryffindor !
your attention , please .
let the feast begin .
i' m half and half .
me dad' s a muggle .
mum' s a witch .
bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out .
percy , who' s that teacher talking to professor quirrell ?
professor snape , head of slytherin house .
what' s he teach ?
potions .
but he fancies the dark arts .
he' s been after quirrell' s job for years .
hello !
how are you ?
welcome to gryffindor .
it' s the bloody baron !
hello , sir nicholas .
have a nice summer ?
dismal .
once again , my request to join the headless hunt has been denied .
i know you .
you' re nearly headless nick .
i prefer sir nicholas , if you don' t mind .
nearly " headless ?
how can you be nearly headless ?
like this .
gryffindors , follow me , please .
keep up .
thank you .
ravenclaw , follow me .
this way .
this is the most direct path to the dormitories .
keep an eye on the staircases .
they like to change .
keep up , please , and follow me .
quickly now , come on .
come on .
that picture' s moving .
look at that one .
i think she fancies you .
look !
who' s that girl ?
welcome to hogwarts .
password ?
caput draconis .
follow me , everyone .
keep up .
quickly , come on .
gather around here .
welcome to the gryffindor common room .
boys ' dormitory is upstairs to the left .
girls , the same on your right .
your belongings have already been brought up .
made it !
can you imagine the look on old mcgonagall' s face if we were late ?
that was bloody brilliant !
thank you for that assessment .
it' d be better if i transfigured mr. potter and you into a watch .
then one of you might be on time .
we got lost .
then perhaps a map ?
i trust you don' t need one to find your seats .
there will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class .
as such , i don' t expect many of you to appreciate ... ... the subtle science and exact art that is potion making .
however , for those select few ... ... who possess the predisposition ...
... i can teach you how to bewitch the mind ... ... and ensnare the senses .
i can tell you how to bottle fame ... ... brew glory and even put a stopper in death .
then again , maybe some of you have come to hogwarts with abilities ... ... so formidable that you feel confident enough ... ... to not pay attention .
mr. potter .
our new celebrity .
what would i get if i added root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood ?
you don' t know ?
let' s try again .
where would you look if i asked you to find a bezoar ?
i don' t know , sir .
what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane ?
i don' t know , sir .
pity .
clearly , fame isn' t everything ... ... is it , mr. potter ?
eye of rabbit , harp string hum turn this water into rum
eye of rabbit ....
what' s seamus trying to do to the water ?
turn it to rum .
actually managed a weak tea yesterday , before
mail' s here .
can i borrow this ?
thanks .
look , neville' s got a remembrall .
i' ve read about those .
the smoke turns red when you' ve forgotten something .
the problem is , i can' t remember what i' ve forgotten .
somebody broke into gringotts .
listen .
believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches ... ... gringotts goblins acknowledge the breach but insist nothing was taken .
the vault in question , number 71 3 , had been emptied earlier that same day .
that' s odd .
that' s the vault hagrid and i went to .
good afternoon , class .
good afternoon , madam hooch .
good afternoon , amanda .
good afternoon .
welcome to your first flying lesson .
what are you waiting for ?
step up to your broomstick .
come on now , hurry up .
stick your hand over the broom and say , " up .
up !
up .
up .
up .
up !
with feeling .
shut up , harry .
now , once you' ve got hold of your broom , i want you to mount it .
grip it tight .
you don' t wanna be sliding off the end .
when i blow my whistle , i want you to kick off from the ground , hard .
keep your broom steady , hover for a moment ... ... then lean forward slightly and touch back down .
on my whistle .
three , two ....
mr. longbottom .
mr. longbottom !
down , down !
neville !
come back down this instant !
everyone out of the way !
is he all right ?
oh , dear , it' s a broken wrist .
poor boy .
come on now , up you get .
keep your feet on the ground while i take him to the hospital wing .
understand ?
if i see a single broom in the air ... ... the one riding it will be expelled before they can say quidditch .
did you see his face ?
if he had squeezed this , he' d have remembered to fall on his arse .
give it here , malfoy .
no .
i' il leave it somewhere for longbottom to find .
how about on the roof ?
what' s the matter , potter ?
bit beyond your reach ?
harry , no way !
you heard what madam hooch said .
besides , you don' t know how to fly .
what an idiot .
give it here or i' il knock you off your broom !
is that so ?
have it your way , then .
nice going , harry .
that was wicked , harry !
harry potter !
follow me .
you wait here .
professor quirrell , excuse me .
could i borrow wood for a moment ?
yes , of course .
potter , this is oliver wood .
wood , i have found you a seeker .
have you heard ?
harry potter' s the new gryffindor seeker .
i always knew he' d do well .
seeker ?
but first years never make the house teams .
you must be the youngest player in  a century , mcgonagall says .
well done , harry .
wood' s just told us .
fred and george are on the team .
beaters .
our job is to make sure you don' t get bloodied up too bad .
can' t make any promises .
rough game , quidditch .
but no one' s died in years .
someone vanishes occasionally .
but they' il turn up in a month or two .
go on .
quidditch is great .
best game there is , and you' il be great too .
i' ve never played .
what if i make a fool of myself ?
you won' t make a fool of yourself .
it' s in your blood .
you never told me your father was a seeker too .
i didn' t know .
i' m telling you , it' s spooky .
she knows more about you than you do .
who doesn' t ?
what' s happening ?
the staircases change , remember ?
let' s go this way .
before the staircase moves again .
does anybody feel like we shouldn' t be here ?
we' re not supposed to be here .
this is the third floor .
it' s forbidden .
let' s go .
it' s filch' s cat !
run !
quick , let' s hide through that door !
it' s locked !
we' re done for !
move over !
alohomora .
get in .
alohomora ?
standard book of spells , chapter seven .
anyone here , my sweet ?
come on .
filch is gone .
he thinks this door' s locked .
it was locked .
and for good reason .
what are they doing , keeping a thing like that locked up in a school ?
didn' t you see what it was standing on ?
i wasn' t looking at its feet !
i was preoccupied with its heads .
or maybe you didn' t notice .
there were three !
it was standing on a trap door .
it wasn' t there by accident .
it' s guarding something .
guarding something ?
that' s right .
now , if you two don' t mind , i' m going to bed ... ... before you come up with another idea to get us killed .
or worse , expelled .
she needs to sort out her priorities .
quidditch is easy to understand .
each team has seven players .
three chasers , two beaters , one keeper and a seeker .
that' s you .
there are three kinds of balls .
this one' s called the quaffle .
the chasers handle the quaffle and try to put it through one of those hoops .
the keeper , that' s me , defends the hoops .
with me so far ?
i think so .
what are those ?
you better take this .
careful now , it' s coming back .
not bad , potter .
you' d make a fair beater .
what was that ?
bludger .
nasty little buggers .
but you are a seeker .
the only thing i want you to worry about is this .
the golden snitch .
i like this ball .
you like it now .
just wait .
it' s wicked fast and damn near impossible to see .
what do i do with it ?
you catch it .
before the other team' s seeker .
you catch this , the game' s over .
you catch this , potter , and we win .
one of a wizard' s most rudimentary skills is levitation ... ... or the ability to make objects fly .
do you have your feathers ?
good .
now , don' t forget the nice wrist movement we' ve been practicing .
the swish and flick .
everyone .
the swish and flick .
good .
oh , and enunciate .
wingardium leviosa .
off you go , then .
wingardium leviosa .
wingardium leviosa .
no , stop , stop , stop !
you' re going to take someone' s eye out .
besides , you' re saying it wrong .
it' s leviosa , not leviosar .
you do it then , if you' re so clever .
go on , go on .
wingardium leviosa .
well done !
see here , everyone , miss granger' s done it !
splendid !
well done , dear .
i think we' re going to need another feather over here .
it' s leviosa , not leviosar .
she' s a nightmare , honestly !
no wonder she hasn' t got any friends .
i think she heard you .
where' s hermione ?
parvati said she wouldn' t come out of the bathroom .
she said that she' d been in there all afternoon , crying .
troll in the dungeon !
troll in the dungeon !
thought you ought to know .
silence !
everyone will please not panic !
now ... ... prefects will lead their house back to the dormitories .
teachers will follow me to the dungeons .
gryffindors , keep up , please , and stay alert .
how could a troll get in ?
not on its own .
trolls are really stupid .
probably people playing jokes .
what ?
hermione !
she doesn' t know .
i think the troll' s left the dungeon .
it' s going into the girls ' bathroom .
hermione , move !
help !
help !
hey , pea brain !
help !
do something !
what ?
anything !
hurry up !
swish and flick .
wingardium leviosa .
cool .
is it dead ?
i don' t think so .
just knocked out .
troll boogers .
oh , my goodness !
explain yourselves , both of you !
well , what it is  it' s my fault , professor mcgonagall .
miss granger ?
i went looking for the troll .
i thought i could handle it .
but i was wrong .
if harry and ron hadn' t come and found me , i' d probably be dead .
be that as it may , it was an extremely foolish thing to do .
i expected more rational behavior and am very disappointed in you .
five points will be taken from gryffindor ... ... for your serious lack of judgment .
as for you two gentlemen ... ... i just hope you realize how fortunate you are .
not many first year students could take on a troll ... ... and live to tell the tale .
five points ... ... will be awarded to each of you ... ... for sheer dumb luck .
perhaps you ought to go .
it might wake up .
take a bit of toast , mate .
go on .
ron' s right .
you' il need your strength today .
i' m not hungry .
good luck today , potter .
you' ve proven yourself against a troll .
a game of quidditch should be easy work .
even if it is against slytherin .
that explains the blood .
blood ?
last night , i' m guessing snape let the troll in as a diversion ... ... so he could get past that dog .
but he got bit , that' s why he' s limping .
but why would anyone go near that dog ?
at gringotts , hagrid took something out of the vault .
said it was hogwarts business , very secret .
you' re saying
that' s what the dog' s guarding .
that' s what snape wants .
bit early for mail , isn' t it ?
but i never get mail .
let' s open it .
it' s a broomstick .
that' s not just a broomstick , it' s a nimbus 2000 !
but who ?
scared , harry ?
a little .
it' s all right .
i felt the same way before my first game .
what happened ?
i don' t really remember .
i took a bludger to the head two minutes in .
woke up in hospital a week later .
welcome to hogwarts ' first quidditch game of the season .
today' s game , slytherin versus gryffindor !
the players take their positions ... ... as madam hooch steps onto the field to begin the game !
now , i want a nice , clean game ... ... from all of you !
the bludgers are up , followed by the golden snitch .
remember , the snitch is worth 1 50 points .
the seeker who catches the snitch ends the game .
the quaffle is released and the game begins !
angelina johnson scores !
ten points for gryffindor !
well done !
slytherin takes the quaffle .
bletchley passes to captain marcus flint .
another 1 0 points to gryffindor !
give me that !
take that side !
what' s going on with harry' s broomstick ?
it' s snape .
he' s jinxing the broom !
jinxing the broom ?
what do we do ?
leave it to me .
come on , hermione !
lacarnum inflamarae .
fire !
you' re on fire !
go , go , go , go !
looks like he' s gonna be sick .
he' s got the snitch !
harry potter receives 1 50 points for catching the snitch !
gryffindor wins !
nonsense !
why would snape put a curse on harry' s broom ?
who knows ?
why was he trying to get past that three headed dog ?
who told you about fluffy ?
fluffy ?
that thing has a name ?
of course he has a name .
he' s mine .
i bought him off an irishman .
i lent him to dumbledore to guard
shouldn' t have said that .
no more questions !
that' s top secret .
but whatever fluffy' s guarding , snape' s trying to steal it .
codswallop .
professor snape is a hogwarts teacher .
teacher or not , i know a spell when i see one .
i' ve read all about them .
you' ve got to keep eye contact , and snape wasn' t blinking .
exactly .
now , you listen to me , all three of you .
you' re meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in .
it' s dangerous .
what that dog is guarding is between dumbledore and nicholas flamel .
nicholas flamel ?
i shouldn' t have said that .
i should not have said that .
nicholas flamel .
who' s nicholas flamel ?
i don' t know .
merry christmas merry christmas
ring the hogwart bell
merry christmas merry christmas
cast a christmas spell
knight to e5 .
queen to e5 .
that' s totally barbaric !
that' s wizard' s chess .
i see you' ve packed .
i see you haven' t .
change of plans .
my parents went to romania to visit my brother charlie .
he' s studying dragons there .
good .
you can help harry .
he' s going to the library to look up nicholas flamel .
we' ve looked a hundred times !
not in the restricted section .
happy christmas .
i think we' ve had a bad influence on her .
harry , wake up !
come on , harry , wake up !
happy christmas , harry .
happy christmas , ron .
what are you wearing ?
oh , my mum made it .
looks like you' ve got one too .
i' ve got presents ?
yeah .
there they are .
your father left this in my possession before he died .
it is time it was returned to you .
use it well .
what is it ?
some kind of cloak .
well , let' s see , then .
put it on .
my body' s gone !
i know what that is .
that' s an invisibility cloak !
i' m invisible ?
they' re really rare .
i wonder who gave it to you .
there was no name .
it just said , " use it well .
famous fire eaters .
fifteenth century fiends .
flamel .
nicholas flamel .
where are you ?
who' s there ?
i know you' re in there .
you can' t hide .
who is it ?
show yourself .
severus , i ....
you don' t want me as your enemy , quirrell .
i don' t know what you mean .
you know perfectly well what i mean .
we' il have another little chat soon .
when you' ve had time to decide where your loyalties lie .
professors .
i found this in the restricted section .
it' s still hot .
that means there' s a student out of bed .
mum ?
dad ?
ron , you' ve really gotta see this !
ron , you' ve gotta see this !
ron , come on , get out of bed !
why ?
there' s something you' ve got to see !
come on !
come !
come look , it' s my parents !
i only see us .
look in properly .
go on , stand there .
there .
you see them , don' t you ?
that' s me !
only i' m head boy .
and i' m holding the quidditch cup .
and bloody hell !
i' m quidditch captain too !
i look good .
harry , do you think this mirror shows the future ?
how can it ?
both my parents are dead .
back again , harry ?
i see that you , like many before you ... ... have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised .
i trust by now you realize what it does .
let me give you a clue .
the happiest man on earth ... ... would look in the mirror and see only himself ... ... exactly as he is .
so then , it shows us what we want .
whatever we want .
yes .
and no .
it shows us nothing more or less ... ... than the deepest and most desperate desires of our hearts .
now you , harry , who have never known your family ... ... you see them standing beside you .
but remember this , harry .
this mirror gives us neither knowledge ... ... or truth .
men have wasted away in front of it .
even gone mad .
that is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home .
and i must ask you ... ... not to go looking for it again .
it does not do to dwell on dreams ... ... and forget to live .
i had you looking in the wrong section .
how could i be so stupid ?
i checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading .
this is light ?
of course !
here it is !
nicholas flamel is the only known maker of the philosopher' s stone .
the what ?
honestly , don' t you two read ?
the philosopher' s stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers .
it' il transform any metal into pure gold ... ... and produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal .
immortal ?
it means you' il never die .
i know what it means !
the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr. nicholas flamel ... ... the noted alchemist who last year celebrated his 665th birthday .
that' s what fluffy' s guarding .
that' s what' s under the trap door .
the philosopher' s stone .
don' t wish to be rude , but i' m in no state to entertain .
we know about the philosopher' s stone .
we think snape' s trying to steal it .
are you still on about him ?
we know he' s after it .
we don' t know why .
snape is one of the teachers protecting the stone .
he won' t steal it .
what ?
you heard .
come on , i' m a bit preoccupied today .
wait a minute .
one of the teachers " ?
there are other things defending the stone , aren' t there ?
spells , enchantments .
right .
waste of bloody time , if you ask me .
ain' t no one gonna get past fluffy .
ain' t a soul knows how , except for me and dumbledore .
i shouldn' t have told you that .
i should not have told you that .
hagrid , what exactly is that ?
that ?
it' s ....
i know what that is !
but , hagrid , how did you get one ?
i won it .
off a stranger i met down at the pub .
seemed quite glad to be rid of it , as a matter of fact .
is that ... ... a dragon ?
that' s not just a dragon .
that' s a norwegian ridgeback .
my brother works with these in romania .
isn' t he beautiful ?
oh , bless him .
look , he knows his mummy .
hello , norbert .
norbert ?
he' s gotta have a name , don' t he ?
don' t you , norbert ?
he' il have to be trained up a bit , of course .
who' s that ?
malfoy .
oh , dear .
hagrid always wanted a dragon .
told me so the first time i met him .
it' s crazy .
and worse , malfoy knows .
i don' t understand .
is that bad ?
it' s bad .
good evening .
nothing , i repeat , nothing ... ... gives a student the right to walk about at night .
therefore , as punishment for your actions , 50 points will be taken .
50 ? !
each .
to ensure it doesn' t happen again ... ... all four of you will receive detention .
excuse me , professor , perhaps i heard you wrong .
i thought you said the four of us .
no , you heard me correctly .
honorable as your intentions were , you too were out of bed after hours .
you will join your classmates in detention .
a pity they let the old punishments die .
was a time detention found you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons .
god , i miss the screaming .
you' il be serving detention with hagrid tonight .
he' s got a little job to do inside the dark forest .
a sorry lot , this , hagrid .
good god , you' re not still on about that bloody dragon , are you ?
norbert' s gone .
dumbledore sent him off to romania to live in a colony .
that' s good , isn' t it ?
he' s with his own kind .
what if he don' t like romania ?
what if the other dragons are mean to him ?
he' s only a baby .
for god' s sake , pull yourself together .
you' re going into the forest .
got to have your wits about you .
the forest ?
i thought that was a joke .
we can' t go in there .
students aren' t allowed .
and there are ... ... werewolves .
there' s more than werewolves in those trees .
you can be sure of that .
nighty night .
right .
let' s go .
hagrid , what is that ?
what we' re here for .
see that ?
that' s unicorn blood , that is .
i found one dead a few weeks ago .
now , this one' s been hurt bad by something .
so , it' s our job to go and find the poor beast .
ron , hermione , come with me .
and , harry , you' il go with malfoy .
okay .
then i get fang .
fine .
just so you know , he' s a bloody coward .
wait till my father hears about this .
this is servant' s stuff .
if i didn' t know better , i' d say you were scared .
i' m not scared , potter .
do you hear that ?
come on , fang .
scared !
what is it , fang ?
harry potter , you must leave .
you are known to many creatures here .
the forest is not safe at this time .
especially for you .
what was that thing you saved me from ?
a monstrous creature .
it is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn .
drinking its blood will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death .
but at a terrible price .
for you have slain something so pure ... ... that the moment the blood touches your lips , you will have a half life .
a cursed life .
who would choose such a life ?
can you think of no one ?
do you mean to say that that thing that killed the unicorn ... ... that was drinking its blood , that was voldemort ?
do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment ?
the philosopher' s stone .
harry !
hello there , firenze .
see you' ve met our young mr. potter .
you all right there , harry ?
harry potter , this is where i leave you .
you' re safe now .
good luck .
you mean , you know who is out there right now in the forest ?
but he' s weak .
he' s living off the unicorns .
don' t you see ?
we had it wrong .
snape doesn' t want the stone for himself .
he wants it for voldemort .
with the elixir of life , voldemort will be strong again .
he' il come back .
but if he comes back ... ... you don' t think he' il try to kill you , do you ?
if he' d had the chance , he might have tried tonight .
and to think i' ve been worrying about my potions final .
hang on a minute .
we' re forgetting one thing .
who' s the one wizard voldemort always feared ?
dumbledore .
as long as dumbledore is around , harry , you' re safe .
as long as dumbledore is around , you can' t be touched .
i' d heard hogwarts ' final exams were frightful , but i found that enjoyable .
speak for yourself .
all right there , harry ?
my scar .
it keeps burning .
it' s happened before .
not like this .
you should see the nurse .
i think it' s a warning .
it means danger' s coming .
of course !
what is it ?
isn' t it odd that what hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon ... ... and a stranger just happens to have one ?
how many people wander around with dragon eggs ?
why didn' t i see it before ?
who gave you the egg ?
what did he look like ?
i never saw his face .
he kept his hood up .
you and this stranger must have talked .
he wanted to know what sort of creatures i looked after .
i said , " after fluffy , a dragon' s gonna be no problem .
was he interested in fluffy ?
of course he was interested .
how often do you come across a three headed dog ?
but i told him , " the trick with any beast is to know how to calm him .
take fluffy , for example .
play him music and he falls straight to sleep .
i shouldn' t have told you that .
where are you going ?
we have to see dumbledore .
immediately !
i' m afraid he' s not here .
he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and left .
he' s gone ?
but this is important !
this is about the philosopher' s stone !
how do you know ?
someone' s going to try and steal it .
i don' t know how you know , but i assure you it is well protected .
now would you go back to your dormitories ?
quietly .
that was no stranger hagrid met .
it was snape .
which means he knows how to get past fluffy .
and with dumbledore gone  good afternoon .
what would three young gryffindors ... ... be doing inside on a day like this ?
we were just  you ought to be careful .
people will think you' re ...
... up to something .
now what do we do ?
we go down the trap door .
tonight .
trevor .
trevor , go !
you shouldn' t be here !
neither should you .
you' re sneaking out again , aren' t you ?
neville , listen .
we were  no , i won' t let you !
you' il get gryffindor into trouble again .
i' il fight you .
neville , i' m really sorry about this .
petrificus totalus .
you' re a little scary sometimes , you know that ?
brilliant , but scary .
let' s go .
sorry .
it' s for your own good , you know .
you stood on my foot !
sorry .
alohomora .
wait a minute .
he' s ... ... snoring .
snape' s already been here .
he' s put a spell on the harp .
it' s got horrible breath .
we have to move its paw .
what ?
come on !
okay .
push .
i' il go first .
don' t follow until i give you a sign .
if something bad happens , get yourselves out .
does it seem a bit quiet to you ?
the harp .
it' s stopped playing .
jump !
lucky this plant thing' s here , really .
stop moving , both of you .
this is devil' s snare .
you have to relax .
if you don' t , it will only kill you faster .
kill us faster ?
oh , now i can relax !
hermione !
now what are we gonna do ?
just relax !
hermione , where are you ?
do what i say !
trust me .
are you okay ?
yeah , i' m fine .
he' s not relaxing , is he ?
apparently not .
we' ve gotta do something .
what ?
i remember reading something in herbology .
devil' s snare , devil' s snare .
it' s deadly fun ... ... but will sulk in the sun !
that' s it !
it hates sunlight .
lumus solem .
ron , you okay ?
yeah .
lucky we didn' t panic .
lucky hermione pays attention in herbology .
what is that ?
i don' t know .
sounds like wings .
curious .
i' ve never seen birds like these .
they' re not birds .
they' re keys .
and i' il bet one of them fits that door .
what' s this all about ?
i don' t know .
strange .
alohomora !
well , it was worth a try .
what will we do ?
there must be a thousand keys .
we want a big , old fashioned one .
probably rusty .
i see it !
the one with the broken wing .
what' s wrong ?
it' s too simple .
go on !
if snape could catch it on that old broomstick , you can .
you' re the youngest seeker in a century .
this complicates things a bit .
catch the key !
hurry up !
i don' t like this .
i don' t like this at all .
where are we ?
a graveyard .
this is no graveyard .
it' s a chessboard .
there' s the door .
now what do we do ?
it' s obvious , isn' t it ?
we' ve got to play our way across the room .
harry , you take the empty bishop' s square .
hermione , you' il be the queen side castle .
as for me , i' il be a knight .
what happens now ?
well , white moves first .
and then ... ... we play .
ron , you don' t suppose this is going to be like ... ... real wizard' s chess , do you ?
you there , d5 .
yes , hermione .
i think this is gonna be exactly like wizard' s chess .
castle to e4 !
pawn to c3 !
wait a minute .
you understand right , harry .
once i make my move , the queen will take me .
then you' re free to check the king .
no .
ron , no !
what is it ?
he' s going to sacrifice himself .
no , there must be another way !
do you wanna stop snape from getting that stone or not ?
harry , it' s you that has to go on .
i know it .
not me .
not hermione .
you .
knight to h3 .
check .
ron !
no , don' t move !
don' t forget , we' re still playing .
checkmate .
take care of ron .
then go to the owlery .
send a message to dumbledore .
ron' s right .
i have to go on .
you' il be okay , harry .
you' re a great wizard .
you really are .
not as good as you .
me ?
books and cleverness .
there are more important things .
friendship and bravery .
and , harry , just be careful .
you ?
no , it can' t be .
snape , he was the
yes , he does seem the type , doesn' t he ?
next to him , who would suspect ... ... poor , stuttering professor quirrell ?
but that day , during the quidditch match , snape tried to kill me .
no , dear boy .
i tried to kill you !
if snape' s cloak hadn' t caught fire and broken my eye contact ... ... i would have succeeded .
even with snape muttering his countercurse .
snape was trying to save me ?
i knew you were a danger to me , especially after halloween .
then you let the troll in !
very good , potter , yes .
snape , unfortunately , wasn' t fooled .
while everyone ran about , he went to the third floor to head me off .
he , of course , never trusted me again .
he rarely left me alone .
but he doesn' t understand .
i' m never alone .
never .
now , what does this mirror do ?
i see what i desire .
i see myself holding the stone .
but how do i get it ?
use the boy .
come here , potter !
now !
tell me , what do you see ?
what is it ?
what do you see ?
i' m shaking hands with dumbledore .
i' ve won the house cup .
he lies .
tell the truth !
what do you see ?
let me speak to him .
master , you are not strong enough .
i have strength enough for this .
harry potter ... ... we meet again .
voldemort .
yes .
you see what i' ve become ?
see what i must do to survive ?
live off another .
a mere parasite .
unicorn blood can sustain me ... ... but it cannot give me a body of my own .
but there is something that can .
something that , conveniently enough , lies in your pocket .
stop him !
don' t be a fool .
why suffer an horrific death ... ... when you can join me and live ?
never !
bravery .
your parents had it too .
tell me , harry ... ... would you like to see your mother and father again ?
together ... ... we can bring them back .
all i ask is for something in return .
that' s it , harry .
there is no good and evil .
there is only power ... ... and those too weak to seek it .
together , we' il do extraordinary things .
just give me the stone !
you liar !
kill him !
what is this magic ?
fool , get the stone !
good afternoon , harry .
tokens from your admirers ?
admirers ?
what happened in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a secret .
so , naturally , the whole school knows .
i see that your friend ronald has saved you the trouble ... ... of opening your chocolate frogs .
ron was here ?
is he all right ?
what about hermione ?
fine .
they' re both just fine .
what happened to the stone ?
relax , dear boy .
the stone has been destroyed .
my friend nicholas and i have had a little chat ... ... and agreed it was best all around .
but then , flamel , he' il die , won' t he ?
he has enough elixir to set his affairs in order .
but yes , he will die .
how is it i got the stone , sir ?
one minute i was staring in the mirror and
you see , only a person ... ... who wanted to find the stone , find it ... ... but not use it , would be able to get it .
that is one of my more brilliant ideas .
and between you and me , that is saying something .
does that mean , with the stone gone , that voldemort can never come back ?
i' m afraid ... ... there are ways in which he can return .
harry , do you know why ... ... professor quirrell couldn' t bear to have you touch him ?
it was because of your mother .
she sacrificed herself for you .
and that kind of act leaves a mark .
no , this kind of mark cannot be seen .
it lives in your very skin .
what is it ?
love , harry .
love .
bertie bott' s every flavor beans .
i was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one .
and since then , i' ve lost my liking for them .
but i think i could be safe ... ... with a nice toffee .
alas !
earwax .
all right there , ron ?
all right .
you ?
all right .
hermione ?
never better .
another year gone .
and now , as i understand it , the house cup needs awarding .
in fourth place , gryffindor with 31 2 points .
third place , hufflepuff with 352 points .
in second place ... ... ravenclaw with 426 points .
and in first place ... ... with 472 points , slytherin house .
nice one , mate .
yes , well done , slytherin .
well done .
however , recent events must be taken into account .
and i have a few last minute points to award .
to miss hermione granger , for the cool use of intellect ... ... while others were in grave peril ... ... 50 points .
good job .
second , to mr. ronald weasley , for the best played game of chess ... ... that hogwarts has seen these many years , 50 points .
and third ... ... to mr. harry potter ... ... for pure nerve and outstanding courage ... ... i award gryffindor house 60 points .
we' re tied with slytherin !
finally , it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies ... ... but a great deal more to stand up to your friends .
i award 1 0 points ... ... to neville longbottom .
assuming that my calculations are correct ... ... i believe that a change of decoration is in order .
gryffindor wins the house cup .
come on , now .
hurry up , you' il be late .
train' s leaving .
go on .
come on , hurry up .
come on , harry .
one minute .
thought you were leaving without saying goodbye , did you ?
this is for you .
thanks , hagrid .
go on .
on with you .
on with you now .
oh , listen , harry .
if that dolt of a cousin of yours , dudley , gives you any grief ... ... you could always threaten him ... ... with a nice pair of ears to go with his tail .
but we' re not allowed to do magic away from hogwarts .
you know that .
i do .
but your cousin don' t , do he ?
feels strange to be going home , doesn' t it ?
i' m not going home .
not really .
