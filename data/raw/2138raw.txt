in the middle ... of the first row , i saw my father .
he seemed tired .
and sleepy .
but he was starring a girl' s ass . the shithead who let you in wouldn' t make him leave .
he told me , that if he pays , he has a right to watch .
i didn' t know who i could count on .
i was desperate .
i didn' t know who to talk to .
that' s why i phoned you .

10 minutes ago , he looked at his watch and left .
at 23 . 45 is the last train to montpellier .

julie ...

lucille , we are on .
it' s me .
european council proposes you to finish the composition of patrice de courcy .
i agreed .
i am working on it now .
i' m trying to understand patrice .
it' s not easy .
can you tell something about this score , shown here for the very first time ?
it' s the first part of the concert patrice composed , commisssioned by the european council .
the concert was to be played just once by twelve symphonic orchestras in the 12 eu cities .
patrice was a secretive man .
only his wife , julie , would understand him .
i tried asking her to participate in this program , but she refused .
i assume that these documents are from your archives .
no , they are not archives .
who can predict ... ?
they are photos and documents which i found in his desk at the conservatory .
his wife didn' t want them .
i am not sure i should show them .
he was a great man .
one of the most important composers of our time .
people like him belong to everybody .
i' il be five minutes .
where did i put it ?
a green calling card .
did you watch tv today ?
no .
i found it .
her number at home and at work .
why do you need this ?
today , on tv , she showed the scores i took from you .
after the accident , when nothing was sure , i made a copy .
when you picked it up , i knew you' d destroy it .
i kept the copy and sent it to strasbourg .
why did you do that ?
the music is so beautiful .
you can' t destroy things like that .
olivier !
i' m sorry .
it' s nothing .
i heard you' re finishing patrice' s concert .
i thought i could try ...
you can' t .
you have no right .
it won' t be the same .
i said i' d try .
i don' t know if i' il finish .
i' il tell you why .
it was a way ... that' s what i thought , to make you cry , run .
the only way of making you say , " i want " or " i don' t want " .
it' s not fair .
you didn' t leave me any choice .
you have no right to .
you want to see what i' ve done ?
i' m not sure i understood .
if i could play for you ...
do you know what the chorus sings ?
i thought patrice had told you .
in greek , the rhythm is different .
who was that girl ?
what girl ?
in the photos on the program .
she was with patrice .
didn' t you know ?
just tell me , were they together ?
yes .
since when ?
several years .
where does she live ?
near montparnasse .
they often met at the courts .
she is a lawyer .
or she works for one .
what do you want to do ?
meet her .
excuse me .
what about equality ?
is it because i don' t speak french that the court won' t hear my case ?
excuse me .
yes ?
you were my husband' s mistress ?
yes .
i didn' t know .
i just found out .
it' s a shame .
now you' il hate him , and me too .
i don' t know ...
of course you will .
it is his child ?
yes .
but he didn' t know .
i found out after the accident .
i didn' t want a child but it happened .
now i want to keep it .
do you have a cigarette ?
you shouldn' t .
do you want to know when and where ?
no .
you want to know if he loved me ?
yes , that was my question .
why ask , i know he loved you .
yes .
he loved me .
julie ...
will you hate me now ?
come in .
what happened ?
you met her ?
once you asked me to take patrice' s papers .
you didn' t want to .
no , but if i had ...
the photos were among them ?
yes .
if i had taken them , i' d have known .
and if i had burned them , i' d never have known .
that' s right .
maybe it' s better this way .
can you show me what you' ve composed ?
these are violins ?
the altos .
and now ...
wait a second .
lighter , without the percussions .
lets remove the trumpets .
instead of a piano ...
a flute ?
flute ...
start back here .
that' s as far as i got .
and the finale ?
i don' t know .
there was a paper .
the counterpoint was supposed to come back .
he told me , it is memento .
try weaving it back in .
van den budenmayer ?
he wanted to allude to him at the end .
you know how much he loved him .
are you still in touch with our lawyer ?
sometimes .
did he sell the house yet ?
i don' t know .
i doubt it .
he' d have called .
tell him not to .
if you can handle all this , will you show me ?
yes .
there was a mattress inside .
mr olivier bought it .
i didn' t think you would need it .
that' s fine .
good morning .
have you been here before ?
no .
never .
upstairs are the bedrooms and the office .
i' il show you them later .
this is the kitchen .
it' s always been like this .
is it a boy or a girl ?
boy .
have you chosen a name ?
yes .
i thought ... he should have his name and his house .
do you still need me ?
no , you can go home .
thank you .
i knew it .
what ?
patrice told me a lot about you .
really ? like what ?
that you are good .
that' s what you want to be .
people can always count on you .
even me .
i' m sorry .
it' s me .
i finished .
come pick it up tomorrow .
or now , if you' re not too tired .
i' m not tired .
but i will not come for the score .
what ?
i won' t pick it up .
i' ve been thinking it for a week .
this music can be mine .
a little heavy and awkward , but mine .
or yours , but everyone would have to know .
are you there ?
yes .
you right .
it' s me .
i wanted to ask you .
you really sleep on the mattress ?
yes .
you never told me .
no i didn' t .
do you still love me ?
i love you .
are you alone ?
of course i' m alone .
i am coming .
if i can talk like angel ,
and i have no love ,
i will be a copper ringing .
if i can prophesy
and if i have no love
i will be nothing .
love is patient .
love is kind .
it bears all things .
and knows everything .
love never ends .
prophecy gone .
if languages silent .
knowledge nothing .
prophecy gone .
languages silent .
and only stays
faith , hope and love
but the biggest one from this three
is love .
