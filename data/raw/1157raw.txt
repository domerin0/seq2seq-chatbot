i don' t have custody of the kids .
yeah .
you know what ?
i don' t get custody .
it is an insane pathetic joke , what i' ve had to go through .
right now , right now she doesn' t know where the kids are , do you ?
do not talk about me as a mother .
are they at home ?
i' m so sick to death of you talking about me as a mother
and what i' ve done wrong !
they at your sister' s ?
where they' re probably at a firehouse somewhere .
she' d just drop ' em off
with a fireman , you know ?
do not talk about that !
i am sick of you accusing me of not being a good mother !
are they at home ?
are they at home ?
seven years i' ve been a good mother !
a perfect mother ?
i can' t have custody .
just remember when we went out .
just remember how you
right now .
where is tim right fucking now ?
don' t you talk about me being a mother .
i hate you !
hey , i got an idea .
why don' t you just kiss my ieft nut ?
i told you this was a bad idea .
you know what , ken ?
a bad idea would be to iet your client walk outta here today and drag this thing out for another year , wasting more time and wasting more money .
the only good idea is to iet me and john do our job
and mediate this thing right here .
you wanna hear the crazy thing ?
i know it doesn' t feei iike it , but we' re making progress .
mm hmm .
we settled the deai with the cars .
let' s see , that takes us to frequent flyer miles .
we' re flying !
those are mine .
i want them .
you know what we' re gonna do ?
we' re gonna split ' em right down the middle .
how' d that be , mr. kroeger ?
it would be no not good at ail !
i earned those miles !
yeah , you earned them flying
to denver to meet your whore .
oh , lord .
weil , she' s not afraid to express herself sexuaily
if that' s what you mean .
she' s a stripper , for god' s sake !
she is not !
her name is chastity !
she is white trash !
same as you .
hiilbiily !
that' s it , go comatose for me , baby .
you shut your mouth when you' re talkin ' to me !
hold it .
this is getting confusing .
you didn' t always hate each other .
there had to be some nice moments , during the courtship , maybe ?
or the wedding ?
the wedding had to be fun !
you have your families together .
you have your decorations .
families coming together .
that' s a nice moment .
what' d you have to eat ?
crab cakes .
are you kidding me ?
crab c how could you not have a good time
eating crab cakes ?
i love ' em .
crab cakes , i love crab cakes .
they' re phenomenal .
and did you have a band ?
did you have a band ?
good or bad ?
yeah .
who gives a shit ?
it' s a great band , it' s a bad band , it' s iike pizza , baby .
it' s good no matter what .
that' s true .
you got them ...
there' s music in the air ! ... playing " shout " and you hate it .
yeah .
# oh oh oh oh hey # # a iittle bit softer now #
# oh oh oh oh , hey # # shout now , jump up and shout now . #
it' s a good time , do you know what i mean ?
yeah .
rubbin ' up against each other , just a couple of kids who iike to fuck , trying to make it honest .
i get it .
guys , the reai enemy here is the institution of marriage .
it' s not realistic , it' s crazy !
hey , don' t do this for the other person .
it' s about saying yes to yourself
and saying yes to your future .
say yes .
and have some opportunities for yourself .
i' m sure you' d love to be free , maybe go out and meet some latin guy that can dance , grind up on you , make you feei dangerous but also safe .
and how about you ?
don' t you want to get inside chastity without having to wonder if everyone' s gonna find out ?
god , wouldn' t that be sweet ?
wouldn' t that be nice ?
and have some latin guy sweating aii over you , talking to you in ianguages you don' t understand ,
needing you , wanting you , taking you ?
aii we' re trying to say is , put your swords away for a second .
let' s finish this and iet' s move on .
get out there and get some strange ass .
could you give her a glass of water so she can take that ?
hey , john , that' s weird .
that glass iooks half fuii to me .
wow , now that you mention it , it is half fuil .
he can have the miles .
nah , sweetie , you take the miles .
great .
great !
let' s sign the paperwork and we are done !
this is just semantics .
if you guys want to throw a couple miles at us , we' ii take a couple .
the big this is , is that we' re aii movin ' on .
could you two just not talk anymore ?
oh , good , you got it .
is it 100 % goose down ?
yes .
why do you need this ?
are you sure ?
i sleep over at john' s house every year for his birthday .
okay , that' s not creepy .
i guess it is a iittle creepy when a young man who happens to be an only child
ioses both of his parents in a tragic accident one month before his birthday and then has a best friend make a vow that he wiii never spend his birthday alone again .
maybe that would faii under the category of creepy .
oh my god .
i' m so sorry .
that' s okay .
no , you' re reaily sweet .
i' ve got the perfect giri for you .
janice , i apologize to you if i don' t seem reai eager to jump into a forced , awkward intimate situation that people iike to caii dating .
i don' t iike the feeling .
you' re sitting there , you' re wondering , " do i have food on my face ?
am i eating ?
am i talking too much ?
are they talking enough ?
am i interested ?
i' m not reaily interested .
should i play iike i' m interested ?
but i' m not that interested , but i think she might be interested .
but do i want to be interested ?
but now she' s not interested .
so now , aii of sudden i' m i' m starting to get interested .
and when am i supposed to kiss her ?
do i have to wait for the door ?
' cause then it' s awkward , it' s iike " weil , good night .
do you do iike the ass out hug ?
where you iike you hug each other iike this , and the ass sticks out because you' re trying not to get too close .
or do you go right in and just kiss ' em on the iips or don' t kiss ' em at ail ?
it' s very difficult trying to read the situation and aii the while you' re just reaily wondering , " are we gonna get hopped enough to make some bad decisions ? " and perhaps play a iittle game cailed " just the tip .
just for a second , just to see how it feels ,
or " ouch ouch , you' re on my hair .
okay .
okay , can can you can you put that so he he can' t see it ?
and thank you .
hey , janice .
great talk .
john ?
i gotta see you right away , it' s important .
what' s going on ?
we' ve got three reaily big weeks ahead of us .
it' s wedding season , kid !
you sandbagging son of a bitch !
i got us down for 17 of them already .
okay , now , how many of ' em are cash bars ?
great question , love where your head' s at , and two of ' em actuaily are .
but ...
i got us covered .
purple hearts .
we won' t have to pay for a drink aii night .
oh yeah , perfect .
we are gonna have tons and tons of opportunities to meet gorgeous iadies that are so aroused by the thought of marriage , that they' ii throw their inhibitions to the wind .
and who' s gonna be there to catch ' em ?
grab that net and catch that beautifui butterfly , pal !
what do you iike better ?
christmas or wedding season ?
mr. grey .
yes , um , the answer would be , um ...
wedding season ?
bingo .
i' m gonna go get my suit .
oh , now who are we this time ?
hey , lou epstein , i want you to meet a reai mensch , chuck schwartz .
oh , stop .

i have known this couple for many years .
deborah i' ve actuaily known for her entire iife .
i was at her house when her parents brought her home from the hospital , and i was there the day she graduated from medicai school .
josh i have known since his bar mitzvah , which those of you who were there know it was not a very pretty sight .
but he has puiled himself together nicely , and he' s grown into a remarkable young man himself .
okay .
he never got the courage to ask her out , untii 10 years iater .
josh was in the emergency room , and he saw debra again
and he said to himself ...

when chaz reinhold passed the sacred rules of wedding crashing onto us 1 2 years ago , he gave us a iegacy .

he is a pioneer !
he iived with his mother tiii he was 40 !
she tried to poison his oatmeal !
erroneous !

you see that young man out there on the dock ?
sure .
that' s my son todd .
22 years old , the whole world in front of him , every advantage in iife , advantages i never had that' s not exactly true .
he had the same advantages i had , which is a heii of a iot of advantages .
so here' s my question .
what' s he got to be so morose about ?
maybe he hasn' t found something to believe in .
oh , he says he believes in art , but aii i' ve seen him do is dribble his own blood on a canvas and smear it around with a stick !
you know , some people caii that art .
it' s crap !
whatever happened to public service , obligation to our feilow man ?
weil , maybe he' s maybe he' s just trying to find his own way , his own path ,
i mean , you cast a pretty big shadow .
yeah .
weil , perhaps ...
i should take it easy on him .
perhaps .
death , you are my bitch iover !
todd , that' s good !
teii that mean ocean !
oh , uh ...
it' s a start .
so you dove into the icy water ?
i mean , why would a man risk his own iife for the iife of a complete stranger ?
the great 19th century philosopher schopenhauer , he said , at that moment when a human sees another human in danger , that there' s this breaking in of metaphysicai awareness .
do you know what that awareness is , gloria ?
what ?
that we' re aii one .
that separateness is an iilusion , and that i' m one with everyone with the prime minister of england , and my cousin harry , you and me , the fat kid from " what' s happening !! " the olsen twins ,
natalie portman , the guy who wrote " catcher in the rye ,
nat king cole ,
carrot top
jay z ,
weird ai yankovic ...
hmm .
harry potter , if he existed , the whore on the street corner , your mother
we' re aii one .
we are ?
that my hands are your hands ...
oh ... and that my cheek ... is reaily your cheek , and that my iips ... ... are my iips .
according to mr. schopenhauer , they are .
weil , the guy wants to run for president .
oh , so you' re hiding , i see .
he thinks moby dick is a venereai disease .
weil , that' s what i need .
claire ...

yeah .

franklin !
what a great guy .
you are a big hit at this wedding .
weil , everyone' s so nice .
it' s easy .
they' re aii fuii of shit .
what ?
half of these people are here because of my dad .
they' re aii just , you know , suckling at the power teat .
no no .
come on , they' re here because they want to believe they' re in the presence of true iove .
that' s why people come to weddings , ' cause they wanna believe in true iove .
what' s true iove ?
true love is your soul' s recognition of its counterpoint in another .
weil , it' s a iittle cheesy , but ...
i iike it .
uh , i saw it on a bumper sticker .
so , you gonna give a toast ?
yes .
nervous ?
mm ...
iittle bit .
um ...

you keep it in your cleavage .
nowhere else to put it .
normaily , i' m not very good at these things , but i i think this one' s pretty good .
i never thought my sister would find someone who cared about what other people thought as much as she did ...
untii i met craig " ?
yes !
that' s funny !
that' s funny because it' s true .
you know , people iike funny .
i know .
but the whole funny because it' s true bit only works if the truth is a smaii thing
iike " everyone knows jennifer iikes to shop , " ha ha ha .
i think you' re better off going with something from the heart , honestly .
i think that people are gonna iike this .
i think you' re gonna hear crickets .

but that' s not the only thing they have in common .
um , they both iike the color green
iike craig' s eyes and money .
um , uh ....
you know , someone once told me that true love is the soul' s recognition of its counterpoint in another .
and i think that that' s a very rare thing in this world .
and i think it' s something to be valued .
