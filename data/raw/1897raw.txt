do you think they' ve been hurt ?
yes .
you' re doing just fine .
we' re going to find them .
but we need you to tell us more .

the pencils .
yeah .

i' m bushed .
i think it' s going to take me a while to get used to it , and on top of that , night shifts .
don' t worry , you' re just starting .
anyhow i' m going to my father about getting your shift changed .
we' il see .
do you know where the toaster is ?
i have no idea .
we still have tons of boxes left to open .
unless you give me a hand , i give up .
hey , big guy .
hi .
today' s your first day , isn' t it ?
yeah .
you nervous ?
a little .
you' il see that you' il like it .
you' il make lots of friends soon .
come on , paul .
you' re gonna be late , come on .
bye .
it' s about time .
i was just about to get you up .
we' ve got to do .
it' s too early .
and i have swim practice .
that' s not for two hours .
and travel .
this is the sticks , i have to take the bus everywhere .
i' m not waiting any longer for this to start looking like a real house .
we' ve been here almost three weeks , and with the notable exception of myself , one has unpacked one single box .
and don' t forget , you promised you were going to paint your room .
mom , i don' t ...
i don' t know if i' m staying .
i thought we discussed this , reggie .
you know how your father and i feel .
when have you ever listened to me ?
i just want to finish school in the states with my friends .
is that so abnormal ?
hi .
hi .
what are you doing here ?
you' re crazy .
i' m not doing anything wrong .
i' m just here to pick up my american friend .
well , you got here too late ' cause i got to go .
just tell me if you' re gonna stay .
i' m not .
come on , you got to go .
why not ?
go , please .
they saw you .
we' il talk about it later .
promise ?
i promise .
i' m warning you , it' s not going to be easy for your family to live in another country .
especially for the kids .
oh , i know .
it' s a big move .
i' m sure hoping they' il get used to it .
it' s a great place .
think so ?
it needs work .
yeah , that' s true .
a hammer and nails and a bit of paint , you' il see .
plus i got one month before semester starts .
good luck .
did you meet ?
no .
hi .
how ya doing ?
i was just saying , it' s like a dream come true .
you know what ?
he' s lying .
you don' t want to play anymore ?
oh , thanks .
everybody seems to be having a good time , right ?
paul reminds me of mark when he was that age .
before ... he left .
now you' il have your grandchildren all to yourself and you' re gonna get sick of them .
yes .
it must be strange for them .
poor paul .
he' il end up crazy about you .
you' il see .
i' m gonna get jealous .
it' s good to see you , dad .
that' s it .
it' s over .
finally .
i thought it would never end .
way to close a party .
not again .
... experts suggest to be cautious .
never look directly at the sun , nor the optlcal device .
so take care , but make sure not to miss it , don' t forget it' s a unique event ,
a very special eclipse that takes place only every 40 years and there are just 5 days to go .
you lived here with grandpa ?
yeah , when i was your age .
that' s when you left for the states ?
why did you have to ?
well , your grandparents decided to split up and ...
i didn' t have a choice i had to go .
with your mom ?
that' s right .
are you and mom going
to split up ?
no .
only families that don' t get along split up .
we get along , don' t we ?
yeah .
it' s the second day and i bet i' m the only one late .
don' t worry .
you' il make it .
' we' re like the lonely wildebeest bleating his plaintive poetry to the infinite herd .
hey dad , do you even know what a wildebeest is ?
sure it' s ...
it' s like a cow .
and what' s your cow saying ?
get your ass out of my face .
get your ass out of my face .
dad look , it worked .
dad ?
hey , shithead , what are you doing ?
move it !
fuck !
help me !
help me !
please !
when was his last attack ?
more than ten years ago .
haughtlngton is unpredictable , but it doesn' t have to be serious .
as quickly as it has come , it can go .
i don' t know .
i' m going to give him haloperidol .
but if he does have an attack , you know about the risk of choking .
just keep a close eye on him .
this couldn' t come at a worse time .
don' t worry .
everything will be fine .
trust me .
dad .
i' m okay , sweetie .
nothing' s happened .
come on , let' s go inside .
we' ve still got a lot of work ahead of us .
this is going to be the best house in the whole world .
mom ?
what happened ?
your father had a small attack , but it' s nothing , don' t worry .
i' ve been talking to your grandfather .
he' s got to go back on medication for a while and that' s all .
mom .
it' s starting again .
nothing is starting again .
this is an isolated incident .
don' t blow it out of proportion .
you remember what happened .
you know exactly what this is .
and just now .
just now what ?
we' re completely isolated .
what if something were to happen ?
we' re ten minutes away from downtown and i already told you , nothing' s going to happen .
mom .
what ?
if you don' t like this house or your family , then get your things and go .
isn' t that what you wanted , to go ?
well , go on then !
i think we' il survive .
since the beginning of time , people considered this phenomenon in different ways .
but how do eclipses exactly work ?
feeling better ?
no .
come on , i fight with my mom all the time .
it' s normal .
no it' s not .
she' s never been this cruel before .
i bet she didn' t even notice .
sometimes people say things that ...
i don' t care .
i' m not comfortable .
i don' t feel happy in that house .
hey there , tiger .
hi .
what are you doing ?
drawing .
you don' t play with this anymore .
you used to like it .
are you going to die ?
no .
listen buddy , what happened is that your dad ...
i got a little too tense this morning .
forget about it .
you' re not going to let that worry you , are you ?
come on , time for bed .
dad , don' t .
come on ,
lights out .
you okay ?
yeah .
what are you doing up ?
i couldn' t sleep .
dad said i couldn' t leave a light on .
since when are you afraid of the dark ?
i' m not .
so ?
it' s different here the dark .
what do you mean ?
it eats my pencils .
come on , i' il tell you what , how' bout we make a deal ?
i' il lie down with you
until you fall asleep .
promise ?
of course .
just give me a minute .
okay .
i can' t find anything wrong .
there' s definitely something wrong .
maybe you should check again .
i don' t know what it could be .
look , i' il check the sockets .
where' s my drawing pad ?
i left it here last night .
these are kind of wierd drawings .
they' re not wierd .
they' re just drawings .
yeah , but you keep on doing the same thing .
they' re not the same .
they' re different .
they look the same to me .
that' s because they' re all children .
but they' re different children .
paul .
what' s this ?
did you hurt yourself ?
i don' t know .
has mom seen it ?
yeah .
she says i probably did it in my sleep .
when it was dark .
i' m going .
if you go outside , don' t go near the road .
okay ?
okay .
what are you doing here ?
i need to use up the last few frames on this roll and you will be my model .
i like you as a photographer , but i think i like you better as a painter .
oh , dad , this is carlos .
hi .
hi .
nice to meet you .
do you know anything about electricity ?
no .
come on .
it doesn' t look like mold , it' s more like ... rust .
i don' t understand .
they painted the whole house before we moved in .
trust me , baby , this is going to look great .
it better .
and i' m gonna go get some paint thinner , just in case .
if you want , phone the electric company .
the hell with that , there' s something here that doesn' t work .
we' ve been here for three weeks now , and every day the lights go out .
they flicker , like the voltage dropped .
do you understand ?
look , if i were you , i' d talk to the neighbors .
if it' s a supply thing , they' il have noticed something too .
what neighbors ?
we don' t have neighbors .
this is a fucking nightmare .
calm down , okay ?
i' ve done all i can .
in other words , fuck you , right ?
in my own house .
and to my face .
fuck you !
well , you' re not getting a penny from me .
not a goddamn penny .
the insurance company will pay me either way .
tell it to them .
not now .
what' s wrong ?
i' m staying .
i can' t leave now .
i' m not going to ask you why .
that' s probably a good idea .
what are you doing up ?
it' s late .
i was waiting up for you .
i' m bushed .
i hope you painted that room .
i need to talk to you .
tomorrow .
i' m wrecked .
you can' t imagine how busy it' s been today .
why can' t wejust talk ?
theres something i need to tell you .
you say not to worry , but dad is a bundle of nerves .
you should have seen the way he blew up at the electrician this morning .
oh , he' s just ...
and like , paul' s not well .
i mean ...
paul' s okay .
look at the drawings .
i mean , does this look like the kind of thing normal kids do ?
i mean ...
he' s a kid .
you should have seen the ones you used to make .
come on .
don' t touch it !
sorry .
these old things can be pretty delicate .
what' s that ?
a room .
hidden behind the wall .
how did you know it was there ?
paul told me .
hey , check it out .
what about hanging it here ?
fuck !
it works .
that' s the beauty of old things , no electricity required .
i' il stop it .
no .
and you , little psychic , how did you know that room was there ?
what are you talking about ?
dad said you told him it was there .
i didn' t say anything .
that' s a lie .
you want to be a martyr , fine .
if you keep this up , i don' t know what we' il do .
what' s going on ?
nothing .
your brother' s gone and bruised himself again .
that' s all .
clumsy .
who did this to you ?
oh , reggie .
don' t start .
please , don' t get paranoid .
don' t get paranoid ?
this has happened twice .
are you trying to tell me there' s nothing going on ?
that' s not what i' m saying .
all i' m saying is these things happen .
he' s got to be more careful , that' s all .
mom , why do you refuse to see what is staring you clearly in the face ?
this is not normal .
we' il talk to your grandpa .
maybe he can talk to paul .
i don' t know .
what more do you want me to do ?
i need to get the rust off the floor .
where did you guys put the matt knife ?
i was opening boxes yesterday .
it' s gotta be in there somewhere .
i don' t understand you .
honestly , i don' t .
what' s going on here ?
everything' s fine .
great .
couldn' t be better , right , mom ?
fantastic .
maybe you ought to unpack something .
what' s up ?
you said you weren' t going to ask me why .
what ?
why i' m staying .
and ?
i wanted you to ask me .
my dad' s kind of sick .
he has this disease .
it' s called " haughtington' s syndrome " .
just before paul was born it got really bad .
he was having attacks .
but you can' t imagine what it must be like to be afraid of your own father .
but ... he' s okay now .
the treatment took .
he' s been fine for years until now .
until now ?
he' s not doing so good .
and there' s definitely something wrong with paul .
he' s woken up with bruises twice now .
hold on .
you don' t think ?
i don' t think anything .
he' s acting weird and he barely speaks .
sometimes i think it' s that house .
you know , this thing is much more complicated than it looks .
where' s paul ?
grandfather came to talk to him .
they' re upstairs .
i' m a mother .
mothers worry .
don' t worry .
regina ...
i was beginning to think i wouldn' t get to see you .
hi , grampa .
you' re going to catch a cold .
dry off , hon .
try and get him to stay for dinner .
thanks again .
how are you ?
i' m good .
and paul ?
he' s fine .
i' m sure this is no big deal .
the change of houses , habits , environment .
but he' s never been afraid of the dark before .
i don' t think that paul' s fear of darkness is your biggest concern .
why would he hurt hinself ?
he' sjust trying to call attention .
but dad' s been strange too .
he' s worse .
he' s aggressive
like he used to be .
that' s nonsense , regina .
i know what you all went through .
and i know it wasn' t easy .
but your father is under control now .
you need to stop worrying .
nothing is going to happen .
all right , dear ?
thanks , granpa .
and now , i' m off .
he says we shouldn' t worry .
kids do strange things sometimes .
we have to find a place to hang that picture .
i don' t know ...
mark , please .
we' re talking about our children .
they' re going through a rough time .
reggie ... she' s at a difficult age .
maybe we' re not being understanding enough with her .
and what about me ?
who' s being understanding with me ?
what are you talking about ?
come on , please .
you don' t think
i hear the little secret conversations that go on behind my back ?
you' re losing it .
right .
exactly .
that' s exactly the attitude i' m talking about .
thank you .
i know where they get it from now .
mark , please , calm down .
did you take your medication ?
mark !
mark ?
mark !
regina !
mom ?
reggie , quickly !
come over here .
i' m feeling kinda woozy .
slow breaths , okay ?
hold it .
i have to get the alcohol .
not now !
mom !
mom !
mom !
where' s the fuse box ?
in the laundry room .
reggie !
paul ?
paul , what' s the matter ?
let me in .
they won' t let me .
there' s someone here .
paul , let me in .
i can' t .
paul !
dad !
shut up !
you' re scaring him !
i said , stop it !
dad !
open this door right now !
mom !
stop it !
shut up !
let me go !
stop !
paul , honey , come here .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
i don' t know .
i got scared .
we couldn' t open the door .
baby ,
are you all right ?
what' s wrong with you ?
i' m here now .
it' s okay .
it' s all over .
it' s not all over .
they never go away .
they only hide .
who ?
what are you talking about ?
the kids .
what kids ?
the ones in my room .
they wouldn' t let me out .
they hate me .
they say i' m an impostor .
paul , there' s no one else here .
just you and me , and mom and dad .
those kids don' t exist .
you' re imagining them .
yes they do .
they come out when it' s dark .
they live in the dark .
didn' t you hear them ?
didn' t you ?
hello .
carlos ?
reggie , is it late ?
i know .
i know , i' m sorry .
i need your help .
what' s wrong ?
it' s this house .
nobody has ever lived in your house before .
the guy who sold the house to your father doesn' t even exist .
neither does the real estate agent or the lawyer .
and the phone number that' s on the contract has never been in service .
so there' s nothing we can check ?
maybe .
i found some information about the architect .
great .
excellent .
wanna help me ?
where' s regina ?
she left at the crack of dawn .
i don' t know .
there' s no one here .
hey , i' ve seen that guy before .
he was standing outside my house , the other night , when it was raining .
i' m sure it' s him .
come on .
you shouldn' t have come .
you designed the house , right ?
i just drew the plans according to the measurements they gave me .
they ?
they who ?
i never saw anyone .
everything was taken care of through an intermediary .
all i had to do was draw and keep quiet .
that was the one thing they insisted on .
but that wasn' t the strange part .
we' ve got to talk .
oh , yes .
we' ve got to talk , about that thing you hung up there .
it' s hideous .
what are you talking about ?
you told me to hang it there .
what ?
last night .
right here .
honey ,
that is not the problem .
oh , no ?
then what is the problem ?
the larvae .
the what ?
the larvae .
they' re everywhere .
in the walls .
i hear them whisper .
they talk about us .
we' ve got to do something .
it was the design .
the shape of the house .
in some parts of the world , a similar form is used in the design and costruction of the temples , or other types of occult architecture .
something about giving birth to spiritual energy , or entities .
it' s been so many years ...
but i didn' t like it .
reggie , i think we' d better get going .
no , just wait .
and then ... the thing with the kids happened .
what are you planning to do ?
find them .
they must have their nest underneath this house somewhere .
and i' m going to find it .
seven children .
they never found them .
except one .
when the police questioned him , what he told them didn' t make any sense ...
it was some crazy story about a round house .
just dark .
so dark .
i' ve spent years obsessed with this story .
prowling around the house .
it' s always been empty .
and then suddenly , one day , i find that a family' s
living there .
with a kid .
for the first time in 40 years .
why now ?
so why haven' t you called the police ?
and tell them what ?
you think they' il listen to the crazy ramblings of some old fart with one foot in the grave ?
you could have told somebody .
oh , yes ,
i could have .
but i didn' t , you want to know why ?
because i was scared .
what are you talking about ?
please go .
that' s all i know .
thank you for sharing your theories , mister villalobos .
my phone number .
in case you remember something .
get your brother
out of the house .
why ?
get him out .
mom !
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
he had another fit , but it' s okay now .
let' s go .
no .
you' re not driving like this .
carlos , can you take them to the hospital , please ?
well , what about you ?
i' m staying .
there' s something i have to do here .
reggie .
carlos , please .
just go .
hello ?
hello .
we' re watching you , bitch .
what the fuck do you want ?
well , i just wanted to tell you your father will be fine .
if that' s all right with you .
mom ,
i' m sorry .
i thought you were someone else .
well , i guess we' ve all been through a lot .
seems the problem was the tranquilizer i gave him after he cut himself .
it reacted badly with the haloperidol .
i' m a nurse .
i should have known .
i don' t think that' s the problem .
we need to talk .
they' re keeping him under observation for a couple of days .
mom ?
mom .
ouroboros .
it' s an old occult symbol .
it means darkness , the return to the beginning ,
chaos ...
what' s going on in my house ?
what the hell is this ?
it' s a ritual .
take the breath and the love out of seven children .
and close the circle with their blood when morning turns to night .
the old man was right .
seven children' s throats cut by someone who loves them .
when morning turns to night ...
the eclipse .
it' s tomorrow .
it only happens every 40 years .
the last time they tried it , something went wrong .
one of the kids escaped .
they had to be seven , but they only got six .
it' s going to happen again .
with paul .
reggie , no one' s going to do anything to paul .
my dad is sick .
sometimes he doesn' t even know what he' s doing .
reggie , you should hear yourself ... ?
mom ,
it' s the house .
you' re not .
dad would never hurt us .
what you' re saying is terrible .
it' s obscene .
is that too hard for you to accept that your father and i ... ?
mom !
please !
dad is sick !
and the stuff that' s been going on , it all fits .
the eclipse is tomorrow .
just don' t go back to that house , please .
we' il do whatever your grandfather says , since he' s your father' s doctor .
not you .
hello .
grampa ,
it' s regina .
regina , come up .
it' s villalobos .
listen , i' ve found one of the papers the guy sent me , you know , the intermediary .
there was a lettherhead , an address .
and i' m going over there .
and you should too .
here , this will make you feel better .
you have to believe me .
i don' t know what to do .
i believe you , regina .
it' s just that this ... is all too strange .
i don' t know .
i don' t understand a lot of what you' ve been telling me .
you have to help me .
you' re a doctor .
they' il listen to you .
okay .
i don' t want you to worry .
i' m going to call the hospital .
please !
don' t let them go back to the house .
they won' t go back .
trust me .
yeah ?
listen .
it' s the old man , villalobos .
he found the address of the guy who was sending him instructlons .
he said he was going over there .
wait .
i want to come with you .
it' s one of those buildings behind the park .
number seventeen .
what ?
reggie , numberseventeen .
number seventeen ?
i' il wait for you out in front ,
but i' m here .
reggie , wait ,
grandpa .
regina .
you should have been in your house .
with your family because they are in the house .
what are you doing in the dark ?
where' s reggie ?
i don' t know .
she hasn' t called .
i expected her to call .
let her be .
you know how she' s been lately .
in the beginning it was just science .
you begin studying minds of children .
how their fears work .
a fear shared by all children .
in all times and in all cultures .
the fear of the dark .
i think i might take a nap .
i' m eshausted .
sounds like a good idea .
and now , we are almost ready .
after so many years .
what are you talking about ?
about darkness , my dear , the true darkness .
a kind of evil in its greatest form .
pure ... and alive .
and now , the moment has arrived .
finally be born .
dirty and perverted .
don' t try so hard ,
regina .
the game has already begun .
the countdown has already begun .
we' re getting closer to the moment when the sun and the moon aligned submerges for a few moments in darkness .
why ?
why ?
because it' s a question of faith .
we are our origin .
and our origin is that .
evil , disorder ...
we discovered the spell to get it back .
the egg temple
and seven children' s throats cut by loving hands .
and the eclipse of course .
it' s just an experiment .
i' m a doctor .
do you know what the ancients called it ?
the great liar .
where' s regina ?
she' s here .
come in .
thank goodness you came .
i didn' t know what to do .
hey .
what' s going on here ?
do you know what' s going on here ?
what' s going on is that you have fucked up .
i don' t know why everyone is trying to ruin this moment for me .
once begun no one can stop it .
there is no way back .
everything was perfect .
we were seven .
we had built the temple .
and waited for the eclipse .
each one with his child .
but at the last minute it fell apart .
i' m the only one left .
the only one who has survived all these years .
ironic , isn' t it ?
because it was my fault .
i had to let my son escape .
i couldn' t do it .
mom !
yes , paul .
can i have a glass of water ?
mom .
please , just go away .
you loved him .
let me go .
we can still stop it .
the rules of the game are very clear .
seven children' s throats cut by hands which love them .
go away ?
you want me to go away .
what the hell are you talking about ?
this is my house .
open the fucking door !
now !
the last minute
i realized it wouldn' t work , because , honestly ,
i didn' t love him .
mark ?
please , just go away .
paul doesn' t have any thing to do with this .
you haven' t understood anything , have you ?
it' s not paul , you idiot .
it' s your father .
what ?
it has to be the same child .
mark , just leave us alone .
open this fucking door !
mark !
mark , you' re sick .
you' re not taking your medicine , that' s why you' re sick .
no !
liar !
that' s a lie !
please , mark , go .
can' t you see you' re sick ?
mom ...
it wasn' t dad .
he didn' t hit me .
it' s impossible .
it' il never happen .
darkness is very wise .
knows very well what a mother is capable of doing to protect her young .
mark , enough !
this is my toy .
a snake , and something about to be born .
it sounds familiar , doesn' t it ?
it' il never happen .
i saw it in the book .
the throat has to be cut ... and my mother wouldn' t do that .
it' s impossible .
have faith , regina .
darkness knows a great deal .
okay .
here' s my medication .
mark .
what are you doing ?
here are the goddamn pills .
daddy .
i' m so sorry .
i love you .
i love you .
so much .
run .
you don' t have much time .
run !
it' s your turn .
answer me !
pills .
fucking pills .
you want me to take pills ...
what' s going on ?
paul , go get a pen .
i' ve got to open him up or he' s going to die .
go !
paul , hurry !
paul , you should just go up to your room and don' t look .
just go , now !
mom , no !
what are you doing ?
he needs air .
i gotta open his throat .
get out of my way .
don' t you understand that' s what it wants ?
your father is dying .
