inside your son an ancestor is protesting , causing this fever .
until that ancestor obtains justice the fever will shake your child like a fish out of water , flapping its gills .
here .
when you sense the fever coming , you soak these roots in water .
make him take a few swallows , and then wash him with the rest .
tell me what' s on your mind .
is his father with the ancestors ?
you know better than i do .
do you want to know if your husband is still alive ?
