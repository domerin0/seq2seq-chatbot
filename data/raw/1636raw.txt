good evening , pilot .
good evening , father .
i have a package for his eminence .
i will see that he receives it .
oh , forgive me , father , but i swore that i would place it in his hands myself .
wait here .
ah , it' s good to see you , father alvito .
i' m pleased your journey was a safe one .
ah , by the grace of god .
you must tell me about it later , but now his eminence is waiting .
vasco rodrigues , your eminence .
you have a package for me , my son ?
from father sebastio in anjiro .
i swore to place it in your hands .
would that all vows were so dutifully obeyed .
thank you , my son .
it' s the english pilot' s rutter .
yes ... i want you to read it all tonight .
if the rutter proves that they' re pirates , which , of course , they are , then the man has damned himself .
yes , your eminence .
why has he come here ?
why now , when we' re almost safe again ?
as god is my judge , if i didn' t know better , i' d believe that the spaniards , or their benedictine lackeys , had deliberately guided him here to plague us .
perhaps they did , your eminence .
may god show them the error of their ways .
where are we going ?
toranaga sama ?
you understand , um , uh ... wakarimasu ka ?
where ?
you' re an unpleasant little bugger , aren' t you ?
hai ?
hai .
that' s what i thought .
anjin san ...
dozo .
yoshi toranaga , lord of the kwanto .
my name is martin alvito of the society of jesus , captain pilot .
lord toranaga has asked me to interpret for him .
first , tell him that we are enemies .
all in good time .
vasco rodrigues has told me of your bravery .
tell lord toranaga that i do not trust you to translate what i say .
you would be wise to reconsider .
lord toranaga has favored me with his confidence for many years .
perhaps i should point out that i' m quite apart from father sebastio , who is , unfortunately , overzealous , and does not speak japanese very well .
his own experience here is limited , and your sudden presence took away god' s grace from him ... regrettably .
tell him .
you may tell him yourself .
the japanese word for " enemy " is teki .
if you point to me and say that word ,
lord toranaga will understand clearly what you mean .
teki .
hmm ?
mariko ...
hai .
since you have objected to my translating your words ,
lord toranaga will have the lady toda explain your responses .
i can have no objection to that , but since the lady is to convey my words , i would like to be introduced .
lord toranaga has agreed .
what is your full name ?
pilot major john blackthorne .
pilot major john blackthorne , may i present the lady toda buntaro mariko .
i am honored , lady .
if you are english , why were you leading dutch ships ?
that is not unusual .
holland and england are allies , and i was glad for the opportunity to sail into these waters .
no english ships were planning to come this far , but we' re a trading fleet , though we have letters of mark to attack the enemy in the new world .
we came to japan to trade .
what are letters of mark ?
legal licenses issued by the crown , our government , giving authority to war on the enemy .
and since your enemy is here , do you plan to war on them here ?
if they war on me .
what you do at sea or in your own countries
is your own affair ,
but here , there is one law for all ,
and foreigners are in our land by permission only .
any public mischief or quarrel
will be dealt with immediately by death .
my laws are clear and will be obeyed .
do you understand ?
yes , sire , but we come in peace .
we came here to trade .
could we discuss trade , sire ?
i need to careen my ship and make repairs .
we can pay for everything .
and then there' s the question ...
when i wish to discuss trade or anything else ,
i will tell you .
meanwhile , please confine yourself to answering the questions .
so , you joined the expedition to trade for profit ... not because of duty or loyalty , for money ?
yes .
it is our custom to be paid , sire .
and i have a share in all ... all goods captured from the enemy .
so , you are a mercenary ?
i was hired as senior pilot to lead the expedition , yes .
but i am not a pirate .
what is a pirate ?
a man who kills , rapes , and plunders for personal profit .
isn' t that the same as a mercenary ?
isn' t that what you are , a pirate and the leader of pirates ?
no , sire , i am not a pirate .
the portuguese and spanish will tell you that because we' re at war .
what did he say ?
what i said is no concern of yours .
when i wish you to know something , i will tell you .
i' m sorry , lord toranaga , i did not mean to be rude .
then hold your tongue until i require an answer .
lord toranaga says that i have told him that holland was a vassal of the spanish until a few years ago .
he asks you if that is true .
yes .
then your ally holland
is fighting against its lawful king .
is that true ?
they' re fighting against spain , yes , but ... " isn' t that rebellion ?
yes or no ?
yes , but there are mitigating circumstances , serious mitigating circumstances .
there are no mitigating circumstances when it comes to rebellion against a sovereign lord .
unless you win .
yes , mr .
foreigner with the impossible name ,
yes ... you name the one mitigating factor .
will you win ?
yes .
hai , we will win .
how long did it take you to travel here ?
almost two years .
exactly one year , 11 months and two days .
how did you come ?
by what route ?
by the pass of magellan .
if i had my maps and rutters , i could show you clearly .
but they were stolen .
they were removed from my cabin with my letters of mark and all my papers .
you claim all your papers were removed ?
yes .
you are to come over here , captain pilot , away from the door .
if you value your life , don' t move suddenly or say anything .
what' s going on ?
you will be a dead man the next time you speak .
lord ishido , master of osaka castle .
lord toranaga asks that you stand .
move slowly and do not speak .
lord ishido says you are a pirate .
captain pilot , you are to follow this man .
where am i going ?
you are to be detained .
where ?
for how long ?
i do not know , my son .
until lord toranaga decides .
thank you for your help , lady .
you are quite welcome , pilot major blackthorne .
like hell , i will .
thank you .
thank you .
uh ... me , anjin san .
anjin san .
you ?
anjin san .
anjin san .
ji ... jirobei .
jirobei san .
hai .
i don' t understand .
wakarimasin .
ah ...
in nomine patri et fili et spiritus sancti .
mother of god !
art thou real ?
yes .
who are you ?
oh , blessed virgin .
real . " who are you ?
l i , l i am friar domingo of the sacred order of saint francis .
my prayers have been answered .
i thought i was seeing another apparition ... a ghost .
the evil spirit ... yes , l i' ve seen so many , so many .
how long have you been here ?
yesterday .
and you ?
oh , a long time .
l i don' t know .
i was put here in september , in the year of our lord 1598 .
it' s may now ... 1600 .
1600 ?
come with me , my son .
they are my flock .
they are all my sons in the blessed lord jesus .
i' ve made so many converts here .
this one' s john .
that' s mark ... methuselah .
please ... sit down , my son .
you must be tired .
one of my flock says that you are a pilot , an anjin .
is this so ?
yes .
you came from manila ?
no , i' ve never been in asia before .
why why are you here ?
jesuits put me here , my son .
jesuits and their filthy lies .
you are not spanish ?
no .
nor portuguese ?
was your ship portuguese ?
tell me the truth , before god .
no , father , it was not portuguese ... before god .
of course .
your ship was spanish .
huh .
spanish .
and you were shipwrecked , like us .
foully thrown into this jail .
falsely accused by those devil jesuits .
god curse them , and show them the error of their treachery .
you said you had never been in asia before ?
this is my first time .
you will be like a child in the wilderness , my son .
yes .
oh , there' s so much to tell .
did you know that jesuits are merely traders ?
gunrunners ?
usurers ?
and that the black ship is worth a million in gold to them every year ?
black ship ?
what is the black ship ?
that is why the jesuits are here , my son .
they control all the silk trade , all the trade with china .
selling silk in japan alone is worth a fortune to them , and once a year , the black ship takes their ungodly profits back to europe , to fill their filthy coffers ever further .
you have never heard of this , my son ?
no , never .
how did that happen ?
the jesuits have forced his holiness the pope to grant them total power over all asia ... them and their dogs , the portuguese .
did you know that all other religious orders are forbidden here ?
yeah .
the jesuits deal in gold , reveling in their profits against the direct orders of his holiness , pope clement , and of our king phillip .
yes , and even against the laws of this land .
they meddle in politics , and lie and cheat and bear false witness against us , my son .
their lies and poison put me here .
i must tend my flock .
there are converts here and ... little time .
sit here , my son .
you will be safe here .
shimsama .
domo arigato .
korewa anjin san .
oh , i' m sorry , my son .
i ... i did not mean to disturb you .
we thought ... we thought you might be thirsty when you awaken .
dozo .
thank you .
how do you say that in japanese ?
domo .
sometimes you say " arigato .
a woman must always be very polite .
she says " arigato goziemashita .
what' s his name ?
he' s gonzalez .
no , his , uh , japanese name .
ah , yes , ah , uh ... kagoya .
but that just means " porter .
they don' t have names .
only the samurai have names .
what do you mean ?
only the samurai have names .
first names and surnames , and everyone else is known by what they do .
porter or ... fisherman , cook ... domo , kagoya san .
only yesterday you said you you came here only yesterday .
what occurred with you , my son ?
when we landed , there was a jesuit there .
jesuits come from hell .
god curse them .
oh ... god forgive my foolish rage .
ayiko yodoro !
ji nomi !
nokoro hajiro !
koyano kanski !
kanski , suyi !
what' s going to happen to him ?
he will be executed .
are you sure ?
his calvary is outside the door .
may the holy madonna take his soul swiftly and give him everlasting reward .
what did he do ?
he broke the law , my son ... their law .
the japanese are a simple people .
death .
you forget about imprisonment .
that is not one of their punishments , my son .
to them , prison ... is a temporary place where they keep a man till they decide his sentence , and that sentence is always death .
oh , only the guilty come here , for just a little while .
but you' ve been here almost two years .
oh , one day they will send for me
like all the others .
this is a resting place between the hell of earth and the glory of everlasting life .
but you' re not guilty of anything .
then i am the one exception .
perhaps ... perhaps it is the will of god .
perhaps those devil jesuits are keeping me alive to torture me .
yeah .
it is so hard to be patient .
so very hard .
what is it , my son ?
nothing , father .
go back to sleep .
there is nothing to fear .
we are all in god' s hands .
ah .
how are you today , my son ?
fine .
thank you , father .
and you ?
i' m quite well .
thank you .
how do you say that in japanese ?
domo , genki desu .
domo , genki desu .
mm hmm .
has anyone ever tried to break out of here ?
no , no .
why should they ?
there' s nowhere to run , nowhere to hide .
to help an escaped prisoner is punishable by death .
you' re here , even if all you do is not report a crime .
even that will take you to the cross .
do not think of it , my son .
no .
no .
tell me more , father ...
hmm ?
about the black ship .
have you ever seen one ?
oh , yes .
they are the greatest ships in the world .
almost 2, 000 tons .
as many as 200 men are needed to sail one .
how many guns do they hold ?
mm , sometimes 20 or 30 .
three decks .
then she probably lumbers when the wind' s abeam .
huh ?
i don' t understand .
big but slow .
the black ship ?
ah , yes .
domo .
denkides .
ah !
oh , you remembered .
if only i had ink and quill and paper , i could write the words down for you .
would you teach me anyway , father ?
i want to learn .
yes , of course .
here .
let let us trace the words in the dirt .
you' il remember them .
now .
dozo is " please .
water .
mizu .
yeah .
and " please wait " ... mate ... kudasai .
mate kudasai .
mate kudasai .
now you write .
anjin san !
your confession , my son , say it quickly .
i don' t think i ... very quickly , my son , and i will give you absolution .
be quick for your immortal soul .
just say that you ... you confess before god all things past and present .
say it now .
the blessed virgin will watch over you .
go with god , father .
