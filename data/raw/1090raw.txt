you better get married soon .
you' re starting to look old .
my dad has been saying that to me since i was 15 ... because nice greek girls are supposed to do three things in life .
marry greek boys , make greek babies , and feed everyone ... until the day we die .
when i was growing up , i knew i was different .
the other girls were blond and delicate .
and i was a swarthy 6 year old with sideburns .
i so badly wanted to be like the popular girls ... all sitting together , talking ... eating their wonder bread sandwiches .
what' s that ?
it' s moussaka .
moose ka ka ?
and while the pretty girls got to go to brownies ...
i had to go to greek school .
at greek school , i learned valuable lessons like .
if nick has one goat and maria has nine , how soon will they marry ?
my mom was always cooking foods filled with warmth and wisdom ... and never forgetting that side dish ofsteaming hot guilt .
niko , don' t play with the food .
when i was your age , we didn' t have food .
ma ?
what ?
why do i have to go to greek school ?
when you get married , don' t you want to be able to write your mother in law a letter ?
niko , come on , eat !
we lived in a normal , middle class chicago neighborhood of tasteful , modest homes .
our house , however , was modeled after the parthenon ... complete with corinthian columns , and guarded by statues of the gods .
in case the neighbors had any doubts about our heritage ... they couldjust check out our subtle tribute to the greek flag .
my dad believed in only two things ... that greeks should educate non greeks about being greek ... and that any ailment , from psoriasis to poison ivy , could be cured with windex .
six years later , i was 12 .
athena , my older , perfect sister , was 15 .
and my brother , nick , was 11 .
every morning , my dad would lecture us on the " history of our people ...
the great civilization , the greeks .
now , name three things the greeks did first .
astronomy , philosophy , and democracy .
bravo !
very good .
now , give me a word ... any word ... and i show you , how the root of that word ... is greek . sweet lord , again .
how about " arachnophobia " ?
arachna , " that comes from the greek word for spider ... and " phobia " is a phobia , it means " fear . " so , " fear of spiders . " there you go .
okay , mr. portokalos , how about the word " kimono " ?
" kimono .
good one .
kimono , kimono .
of course , " kimono " comes from the greek word ...
cheimonas , " which means " winter . " so , what do you wear in the wintertime ... to stay warm ?
a robe .
you see , " robe , " " kimono . " there you go .
bye bye .
goodbye , mr. portokalos .
toula !
you should be proud to be greek .
a couple more years went by ... and my dad brought his mother from greece to live with us ... because we weren' t weird enough .
where is she going ?
mama , please !
the greeks and the turks friends now .
we told my grandma the war was over ... but she still slept with a knife under her pillow .
stop hitting me !
niko , be careful . she has a very mean punch .
nice greek girls who don' t find a husband work in the family restaurant .
so , here i am , day after day , year after year .
thirty , and way past my expiration date .
my god .
it' s freezing .
fotoula !
you closed last night , you' re opening this morning ?
i have no life .
fotoula , you talk to me sometime .
ma , you' re gonna make me swallow my tongue .
toula ! ls nikki here ?
what' s up ?
no , my nikki . she was supposed to come over to curl my hairs .
nick , did you check the meat before you signed for it ?
dad checked it .
it better be fresh .
my brother has two jobs , to cook and to marry a greek virgin .
voula , have something to eat before you go to work .
if nagging was an olympic sport , my aunt voula would have a gold medal .
taki , you couldn' t wait for me ?
sorry . sorry , sorry .
don' t " sorry " me .
look at this .
rash . somebody gave me the mati .
put some windex on it .
oh , gus , please .

why you not wait for me ?
gus .

anyway , i tell her ...
i will send her to greece to find somebody . she' s not too old .
she' s okay .
in greece ... don' t tell anyone how old she is . she won' t go . she won' t go ?

for the new menu ?
where did you get that ?
i drew it , dad .
dad , i' ve been going through our inventory ... and i' ve noticed that we' ve been doing a lot of unnecessary ordering .
i' ve been thinking that maybe we should update our system .
we could get a computer .
i don' t know if you remember , but i got all a' s in computers .
but there' s a lot of new stuff to learn now ... so , if you want , i could go to college and take a few courses .
why ?
why you want to leave me ?
i' m not leaving you .
don' t you want me to do something with my life ?
yes !
get married !
make babies !
you look so old !
hey , toula .
come on .
i know what you want .
you have , how you say , a spirit .
you want to see things .
you want to learn .
i know , you' re from my side .
come on .
don' t you worry .
i' m gonna talk to him .
dad is so stubborn .
what he says goes .
the man is the head of the house .
let me tell you something , toula .
the man is the head , but the woman is the neck .
and she can turn the head any way she wants .
my baby .
don' t cry .
come on .
and what is wrong with toula going to school downtown ?
they use drugs downtown .
what are you saying ?
are you saying that toula will get involved with drugs ?
take this bag down to the bus depot , " and she' il do it . she' s not stupid . she' s smart .
i know she' s smart , so what for she needs more school ? she' s smart enough for a girl .
you think you' re smarter than me ?
no , i mean , you know
what ?
what do you mean ?
i run the restaurant , i cook , i clean ...
i wash for you , and i raised three kids ... and i teach sunday school .
you know , it' s lucky for me i have you to tie my shoes .
maria ....
is this seat taken ? sure .
hi .
that' s what i want to talk to you about .
look at you .
what are you talking about ?
what ?
i don' t like my butt .
taki likes it .
i won' t pretend the travel industry is something i' ve always wanted to do .
i' m not gonna pretend that , but i' m saying that it' s different .
you know i' ve been learning about computers ?
there' s this course , a seminar .
it' s all about computers and tourism .
there are all the latest applications and programs .
i could apply it here , thia .
and your business would double or triple .
you could be with thio more , and you could take a vacation .
i could book it for you .
but , thia , would you hire me ?
of course .
my god !
we must let kosta think this was his idea , that he came up with it .
ma , he' il figure it out .
don' t worry .
i know what to do .
you don' t know what to do , you talk .
do you want my help ?
tell me what to say , but don' t tell me what to say .
perfect .
that' s good .
so , voula .
how is business ?
woe to me .
business is bad .
what' s the matter ?
what happened ?
do you need money ?
no , what she means is that , with the two businesses , she suffers .
she suffers . she has to be at the travel agency alone , all day ... because everybody else needs to be working at the big dry cleaning store .
that' s right .
i make taki go to the dry cleaner store ... and now i have no time with him .
so , send angelo or nikki ... to the travel agency , you be with taki at the dry cleaner .
that would be good .
that would be no good .
because ... neither angelo nor nikki know how to use the computer .
that' s why that no work .
computer ?
i have your answer .
toula will go to the travel agency ... and you send nikki here to work for us .
i can' t believe this .
wonderful .
you see , a man ....
you' re just so smart , i love you .

that' s where we dip the baby ... in a beautiful , little silver basin .
it' s not so bad ?
are you kidding ?
right , you' re so not worth this .
yes , you are .
you' re all oily .
i' m greek , now .

so , for " happy easter , " we say " khristos anesti .
then the other person says back , " alithos anesti . " so if you want to say " happy easter , " you go , " khristos anesti . " so try it .
that' s good .

and " miller " come from ... the greek word milo ... which is mean " apple .
there you go .
as many ofyou know ... our name portokalos ... is come from the greek word portokali ... which means " orange .
so , okay ... here tonight ... we have apple and orange .
we all different ... but , in the end , we all fruit .
yes , we are all fruit .
my wife and me , we have a gift .

yia sou , lan .
sometimes , i' m afraid that it didn' t happen .
i' m scared i' il wake up and still be buttering garlic bread ... waiting for my life to start .
but it did happen .
it did !
and i figured out some stuff .
my family is big and loud ... but they' re my family .
we fight and we laugh .
and yes , we roast lamb on a spit in the front yard .
and wherever i go , whatever i do ... they will always be there .
so , lan and i moved into the house my parents bought us .
