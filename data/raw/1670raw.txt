the little one' s her sister daisy .
the middle one' s their cousin gracie .

nothing out of the ordinary .
there' s two applications for section 63 exemptions .
police reports are there .
william harris is applying for permission to marry .
she' s half caste also .
and mary wilson' s applying for permission to visit her child at moore river .
she' s quite agitated .
oh . and gladys phillips has written for permission to buy some new shoes .
she had a new pair a year ago .
er . now . this report from constable riggs about three little half caste girls at the jigalong fence depot molly .
gracie and daisy .
the youngest is of particular concern .
she is promised to a full blood .
i' m authorising their removal .
they' re to be taken to moore river as soon as possible .
oh . and miss thomas . if you could check that the rate for police transportation is still .
i believe . eight pence per mile .
yes .
mr neville .
thank you .
that country over there . that' s wongi country .
you can' t go there .
you get big trouble .
yeah .
i know .
where your country ?
my country ?
down south .
long way from here .
our dad works there on the rabbit fence .
yeah ?
how far does rabbit fence go to ?
the rabbit proof fence ?
it goes all the way to the sea down that way .
right to the top of australia .
longest fence in the world .
and all the way to the sea down that way .
1 . 500 miles long .
keeps the rabbits on that side of the fence .
keeps the farmland on this side of the fence .
that molly' s getting to be a big girl .
mr neville' s been writing to me about those girls . you know .
frankie ...
come on . it' s your turn .
come and get your rations .
hurry up .
come for the three girls .
maude .
no !
this is my kids !
mlne !
it' s the law .
maude .
no !
got no say in it .
no !

move one inch and i' il lock your mother up !
neville' s their legal guardian .

maude !
don' t take them !
no !
you' ve got no say in it !
no !

nothing you can do here . old girl !
nothing you can do .
leave them !
as you know . every aborigine born in this state comes under my control .
notice . if you will . the half caste child .
and there are ever increasing numbers of them .
now . what is to happen to them ?
are we to allow the creation of an unwanted third race ?
should coloureds be encouraged to go back to the black ?
or should they be advanced to white status and be absorbed in the white population ?
now . time and again .
i' m asked by some white man .
if i marry this coloured person . " will our children be black ?
and as chief protector of aborigines . it is my responsibility to accept or reject those marriages .
here is the answer .
three generations .
half blood grandmother .
quadroon daughter .
octoroon grandson .
now . as you can see . in the third generation . or third cross . no trace of native origin is apparent .
the continuing infiltration of white blood finally stamps out the black colour .
the aboriginal has simply been bred out .
now ... ... we come to ...
we come to the moore river native settlement .
ladies . most of you are familiar with our work here the training of domestic servants and farm labourers .
i would like to thank you for your continuing support .
hundreds of half caste children have been gathered up and brought here to be given the benefit of everything our culture has to offer .
for if we are to fit and train such children for the future . they cannot be left as they are .
and . in spite of himself . the native must be helped .

hey . you from that moore river place . eh ?
we' re going home .
where your country ?
jigalong .
jigalong ?
proper long way .
do you know what you' re doing ?
that tracker from moore river ... ... he pretty good .
i heard he get them runaways all the time .
you' ve got to be good to beat him .
he' il take you back to that place .
here .
you watch out for him . eh ?
you think you' re so smart .
where are we ?
we' re lost .
jigalong that way .
north .
the tracker followed them to this riverbank but lost their tracks in the water about a week ago .
there' s been no sign of them since .
three little half castes .
we' re talking quite a few man hours here .
who' s going to pay for it ?
there' s very little money in my departmental budget .
i' m hoping your men can combine this with their regular duties .
we' il be able to handle all the notifications . posting police stations . farms ...
we' il provide a description .
but if my men make trips outside their duties . it' s an impost on your department .
mr neville .
if your men are on other jobs . there is no extra expense .
i see that .
mr neville .
every one of your men has a role as local protector .
my men will do their jobs .
mr neville .
now . a week ago . you said .
yes .
hey .
maude .
your girls have gone .
what did you say ?
they' ve run away from moore river .
they' re gone .
everybody' s looking for them .
and what do you think you might be up to ?
thieving my eggs . eh ?
you come out here where i can see you .
come on .
stand up .
out you come .
and get rid of that bread .
it' s filthy .
you want something to eat . you ask for it .
come on .
i' m not going to bite you .
are you on your own ?
hmm ?
got anyone with you ?
there you are .
where are you girls planning on going ?
cat got your tongue . eh ?
now get !
go on .
and watch out for those boys further along .
they go out hunting rabbits along the fence .
that rabbit proof fence ?
yes . the rabbit proof fence .
where that rabbit fence ?
east .
which way now ?
that way .
that fence .
find that rabbit fence . we go home .
then we see our mum .
" the chief protector of aborigines .
mr a. o. neville ...
the devil ! " ... is concerned about three native girls
ranging from eight to fourteen years of age
who a month ago
ran away from the moore river native settlement .
he would be grateful if any person ... who saw them
would notify him ... promptly .
we have been searching high and low for the children
for a month past . ' added mr neville .
and all the trace we found of them was a dead rabbit . " '
it' s the fence !
it' s the fence !
she found it !
now . the latest sighting which is four days old is ...
the man from the newspaper .
i have nothing more to say !
may i have a look ?
dalwallinu .
yes ?
bunnawarra .
yalgoo .
dalwallinu .
bunnawarra .
yalgoo .
dalwallinu .
bunnawarra .
yalgoo .
they' re on the fence .
they' re following the rabbit proof fence .
right .
just because people use neolithic tools .
inspector . does not mean they have neolithic minds .
this makes our task very much easier .
look .
there' s a branch off here to the west . north of yalgoo .
now . you put your man out here on the fence and north of this junction .
he can start to come down it to meet them .
i' il have moodoo come up from the south behind them .
we can' t miss them .
where daisy ?
wait here .
my legs .
molly .
they hurt .
i can' t walk .
i' il carry you only once . alright ?
come on .
come on .
don' t think i' m carrying you all the way .
camp .
molly .
damn me .
where are you girls headed ?
going to mullewa ?
got family there ?
where mullewa ?
mullewa ?
west .
the way you' re headed along the number two fence .
are there two rabbit proof fence ?
my oath .
we' ve got three of them .
we' re on the wrong fence .
where the north fence ?
north fence back that way where you come from .
you can cut across .
i' il show you .
number one rabbit fence .
here' s the number two fence .
now . you' re here .
but you want to be here .
now . if you cut across here ... ... you save yourself 1 00 mile or so .
it' s not hard .
i' m going back .
i don' t have the petrol .
hey . we' re hungry .
are youse that lot from moore river ?
yeah .
what you girls walk all that way ?
yeah .
800 miles ?
i was there .
too scared to run away . but .
everyone was always caught . stuck in that boob .
youse got the furtherest .
where you heading ?
home .
mavis !
stay here .
i' il come back and get you .
sleep with me .
i' il get you some food .
just getting the washing .
mrs evans !
shh !
what' s that ?
there' s someone coming .

mavis .

shh . shh . shh .

evans .
hello .
mrs evans .
quick !
wake up .
wake up .
you got to go .
let' s have a look .
out that way .
just keep going .
they were running out over there about an hour or so ago .
we' il pick up their tracks in the morning .
i' il make a cup of tea .
that' s the tracker .
yeah . that' s him .
hop on .
i do not expect you to understand what i am trying to do for these people .
but i' il not have my plans jeopardised .
the problem of half castes is not simply going to go away .
if it is not dealt with now . it will fester for years to come .
these children are that problem .
please explain exactly what happened .
i don' t know how they did it . but we lost them .
i had larsen out there .
moodoo was with him .
they' re making right fools of us .
they are indeed .
inspector .
and the cost is more than to just our pride .
this department' s reputation is beginning to suffer .
my men have better things to do than chase your charges all around the country .
now ... ... they' re coming into very rough terrain .
once they' re much past meekatharra .
i can' t risk any of my men .
yes . we must find them before they reach real desert country .
so this is what we' re going to do .
you get your man up there .
moodoo can join him .
well up the fence around here .
far enough up so we know we cannot possibly miss them .
and i want them to stay there .
they can set up camp and wait .
costly .
well . we' il just have to bear it .
their lives may be at stake .
inspector .
i understand the mother of one of the girls has gone to wiluna .
the children are headed into that country .
i want the word spread .
let' s see what that does .
you wouldn' t get me out there .
she' s pretty clever . that girl .
she wants to go home .
good thing you kids ran into me .
a lot of people worried for you .
the police are up and down the country looking for youse .
it' s in all the papers .
which one of you is gracie ?
are you gracie ?
i hear your mummy in wiluna .
you can catch a train there from meeka .
come on .
let' s go .
wiluna is she at wiluna ?
yes .
come on .
gracie .
don' t listen to him .
he' s a liar .
maybe she there .
molly .
maybe he telling the truth .
molly .
let' s go to meeka . catch a train to wiluna .
if they see us . they' il catch us .
we can' t stop now .
we must keep going .
we' re nearly there .
but .
molly .

she at wiluna .
i want mummy .
come on .
come on .
daisy .
come on .
daisy .
you have to carry me .
molly .
hop on .
she not coming .
don' t look back .
don' t look back .
she' il come .
higher .

three !
one for you . one for me and one for both of us .
mmm !
come on .
dais .
we' ve got to go back for gracie .
go !
what are you going to do sell the thing ?
i' ve got her !
i want to get the train to mummy !
this is one of them .
she thinks her mummy' s there .
gracie .
oi !
grab her !
hey !
gotcha !
you' re not going anywhere .
now . get in that car now .
thanks .
jacky .
there will be a shilling for you back at the station .
i' m taking you back where you belong .
she gone .
molly ?
she not coming back ?
needle in a haystack .
well . that' s it .
pack your stuff .
we' re getting out of here .
they' re only paying us for three weeks .
to constable riggs .
police station .
nullagine .
the two missing half caste girls .
molly and daisy . are returning to jigalong via the rabbit proof fence . our efforts to apprehend them thus far having come to nought .
i therefore expect them to arrive in jigalong in about a month' s time .
in your capacity as local protector . you are to proceed to jigalong to await their arrival and effect their recapture .
yours . etc .
no fence .
i want mother .
the fence will come back .
home .
it' s coming through now .
riggs arrived jigalong .
awaits your instructions .
yes . there will be a reply .
please wait .
" girl is to be sent south . via meekatharra . " to be accompanied at all times .
awaiting notification .
what' s all that about ?
just some women' s business .
been going on all day .
hey .
molly .
yeah ?
that tracker . he not going to get us now .
nah . he' s not going to get us .
i' m not going to stay here .
i can feel it .
they' re up to something .
i' m going to go take a look .
i lost one ... ... i lost one .
to constable riggs .
police station .
nullagine .
at present . we lack the funds to pursue the missing half caste girls .
molly and daisy .
i would ask to be kept informed of their whereabouts . so that at some future date . they may indeed be ... recovered .
we face an uphill battle with these people ... ... especially the bush natives . who have to be protected against themselves .
if they would only understand what we are trying to do for them .
yours . etc .
thank you .
