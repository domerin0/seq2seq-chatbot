doug ?
honey , are you all right ?
you' re dreaming .
was it about mars ?
is that better ?
my poor baby .
this is getting to be an obsession .
was she there ?
who ?
the one you told me about .
the brunette .
lori .
i can' t believe you' re jealous of a dream .
who is she ?
nobody .
nobody " ?
what' s her name ?
i don' t know .
tell me !
i don' t know !
you better tell me !
it' s not funny , doug .
you dream about her every night .
and i' m always back in the morning .
let me go !
come on , baby .
you know you' re the girl of my dreams .
you mean it ?
you know i do .
i' il give you something to dream about .
the chairman defended the attack , saying that space based weapons ...
the chairman defended the attack , saying that space based weapons ... are our only defense against the southern block' s numerical superiority .
and more violence last night on mars ... where terrorists demanding independence ... once again halted the extraction of terbinium ore .
kuato and his so called freedom brigade ... claimed credit for this latest bombing , which attempted to reopen the sealed off pyramid mines .
mars military restored order with minimal use of force ... and all damage to the strategic facility was repaired within hours .
no cameras !
with one mine already closed , mars administrator vilos cohaagen ... vowed that troops would be used if necessary ... to keep production at full capacity .
no wonder you' re having nightmares .
you' re always watching the news .
lori .
doug ?
let' s do it .
do what ?
move to mars .
why do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning ?
just think about it .
we' ve been through this before .
you' d hate it on mars .
it' s dry , it' s ugly , it' s boring .
i mean , really , a revolution could break out there any second .
cohaagen says it' s just a few extremists .
you believe him ?
okay .
forget about it .
absolutely not .
mars was colonized by the northern block at enormous expense .
our entire war effort depends on their terbinium .
it' s absurd to think we' d give it away ... just because some lazy mutants think they own the planet .
maybe we should take a trip .
any comment on the rumor ...
lori , move . that you' ve closed the pyramid mine ... because you found alien artifacts inside ?
there' s a lot better places than mars .
what about saturn ?
don' t you wanna see saturn ?
i wish we could find some artifacts .
our tourist industry could use a boost .
everybody says that its gorgeous .
the fact is , it' s mr. kuato and his terrorists who spread these rumors ... to undermine trust in the government .
we could take a long space cruise , the kind with nothing to do .
have you found kuato yet ?
we don' t even know what he looks like .
what do you say ?
that' s the news .
stay tuned for weather .
i' m late .
but first , this .
tonight , world series game five ...
sweetheart .
iive from tokyo .
i know it' s hard being in a new town , but let' s give it a chance , okay ?
don' t you understand ?
i feel like i was made for something more than this .
i want to do something with my life , to be somebody .
you are somebody .
you' re the man i love .
bye .
have a nice day .
you are now entering a safety zone .
no unauthorized weapons allowed beyond this point .
would you like to ski ... but you' re snowed under with work ?
do you dream of a vacation at the bottom of the ocean ... but you can' t float the bill ?
have you always wanted to climb the mountains of mars ... but now you' re over the hill ?
then come to rekall lncorporated ... where you can buy the memory of your ideal vacation ... cheaper , safer and better than the real thing .
so don' t let life pass you by .
call rekall for the memory of a lifetime .
for the memory of a lifetime
rekall , rekall , rekall
harry .
you ever hear of rekall ?
rekall ?
where they sell those fake memories .
oh , rekall .
thinking of going there ?
maybe .
well , don' t .
why not ?
a friend of mine tried it , nearly got himself lobotomized .
no shit ?
don' t fuck with your brain .
it ain' t worth it .
i guess not .
good afternoon .
welcome to rekall .
douglas quaid .
i have an appointment .
bob ?
yeah ?
doug quaid is here to see you .
i' il be right out .
just one minute , mr. quaid .
thank you .
paul mcclane .
good to see you .
nice to meet you .
come on in .
make yourself comfortable .
thank you .
help me out here , doug .
you were interested in a memory of  mars .
yeah .
mars .
is there a problem ?
to be perfectly honest ... if you like outer space ... you' d be happier with one of our saturn cruises .
i' m not interested in saturn .
i said mars .
okay .
you' re the boss .
mars it is .
now , let me see .
the basic mars package ... will run you 899 credits .
now , that' s for two full weeks of memories , complete in every detail .
a longer trip is more expensive because it' s a deeper implant .
what' s in the two week package ?
when you go rekall , you get nothing but first class memories .
mount pyramid , the grand canals ... and , of course , venusville .
but how real does it seem ?
as real as any memory in your head .
don' t bullshit me .
i' m telling you , your brain will not know the difference .
that' s guaranteed or your money back .
what about the guy you lobotomized ?
did he get a refund ?
you' re talking ancient history .
nowadays traveling with rekall is safer than getting on a rocket .
check out those statistics .
besides , a real holiday is a pain in the butt .
you got lost luggage , lousy weather ... crooked taxi drivers .
when you travel with rekall ... everything is perfect .
what do you say ?
all right .
smart move .
while you fill out this questionnaire ,
i' il familiarize you with some of our options .
no options .
whatever you say .
let me ask you one question .
what is exactly the same ... about every single vacation you have ever taken ?
i give up .
you .
you' re the same .
no matter where you go , it' s always you .
let me suggest that you take a vacation ... from yourself .
i know , it sounds wild .
it is the latest thing in travel .
we call it the ego trip .
i' m not interested .
you' re gonna love this , doug .
we offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip .
why go to mars as a tourist when you can go as a playboy ... or a famous jock or
secret agent .
how much is that ?
let me tantalize you .
you are a top operative under deep cover on your most important mission .
people are trying to kill you .
you meet this beautiful , exotic woman .
go on .
i don' t wanna spoil it for you ... but by the time the trip is over ... you get the girl , kill the bad guys and save the entire planet .
now , you tell me .
isn' t that worth a measly 300 credits ?
your first trip ?
don' t worry .
things hardly ever fuck up around here .
good evening ...
doug .
i' m dr. lull .
nice to meet you .
ernie , patch in matrix 62 b 37 .
would you like us to integrate some alien stuff ?
sure .
why not ?
two headed monsters ?
don' t you watch the news ?
we' re doing alien artifacts now .
it' s wild .
yeah , they date back a million years .
ernie ?
that' s a new one .
blue sky on mars .
been married long ?
eight years .
oh , i see .
slipping away for a little hanky panky .
no .
i' m fascinated with mars .
all systems go .
number seven .
ready for dreamland ?
i' il be asking you some questions so we can fine tune the ego program .
you answer honestly , you' il enjoy yourself much more .
your sexual orientation .
hetero .
how do you like your women ?
blonde ?
brunette ?
redhead ?
brunette .
slim .
athletic .
voluptuous .
athletic .
demure .
aggressive .
sleazy .
be honest .
sleazy .
demure .
41a , ernie .
boy , is he gonna have a wild time .
he' s not gonna want to come back .
that' s for sure .
so ... what do you say ?
i' m not so sure , and i don' t get a souvenir .
not true .
we supply t shirts , snapshots of you at the site ... and even letters from
what is it ?
get down here .
i am with a very important client .
looks like we got another schizoid embolism .
i' il be right back .
mr. mcclane ?
bob !
what' s wrong ?
don' t let her leave !
get off !
you blew my cover !
you can' t do a simple goddamn double implant ?
we hit a memory cap .
they' re coming !
they' il kill you all !
what is he talking about ?
let me go !
mr. quaid , try to calm down !
my name is not quaid .
let me go !
untie me now !
ernie , grab his leg !
hold him down !
let me go !
are you all right ?
listen to me .
he' s been going on and on about mars .
he has really been there .
use your head .
he' s just acting out the " secret agent " portion of his ego trip .
that' s not possible .
why not ?
we haven' t implanted it yet .
oh , shit .
i' ve been trying to tell you , someone has erased his memory .
excuse me .
someone " ?
we' re talking about the agency .
shut up !
bob , the client' s gone .
renata , cover up any memory he' s got of us or rekall .
i' il try .
it' s pretty messy in there .
ernie , dump him in a cab .
tiffany , you help him .
i' m gonna destroy his file and refund his money .
and if anybody comes asking , we never heard of douglas quaid .
where am l ?
you' re in a johnnycab .
what am i doing here ?
i' m sorry .
would you please rephrase the question ?
how did i get in this taxi ?
the door opened , you got in .
hell of a day , isn' t it ?
this okay ?
right here .
thank you for taking johnnycab .
thank you .
hope you enjoyed the ride .
hey , quaid .
harry .

thank you .
i' m already late

let' s go get that drink .
move it !
what is going on ?
what the fuck did i do wrong ?
tell me !
you blabbed about mars !
are you crazy ?
i don' t even know anything about mars !
you should' ve listened to me , quaid .
i was there to keep you out of trouble .
you' re making a big mistake .
you got me mixed up with somebody else .
you got yourself mixed up with
and pivot ... and serve ... and shift ... and stroke ...
very good .
perfect form .
hi , honey .
what are you doing ?
some men just tried to kill me .
muggers ?
are you all right ?
no , they were spies or something .
harry , from work , he was the get down !
harry was the boss .
take it easy , doug , okay ?
why would spies want to kill you ?
i don' t know .
it had something to do with mars .
you' ve never been to mars .
it sounds crazy , but i went to this rekall place after work
those brain butchers ?
let me finish .
what did they do to you ?
i got a trip to mars .
forget about rekall .
they were going to kill me .
doug , nobody tried to kill you .
they did .
but i killed them .
listen , sweetheart .
those assholes at rekall have fucked up your mind .
you' re having paranoid delusions .
you call this a delusion ?
doug , i' m gonna call a doctor .
don' t .
don' t call anybody .
lori , go !
get out !
why are you doing this ?
talk !
i' m not your wife .
the hell you' re not .
i never saw you before six weeks ago .
our marriage is just a memory implant .
you think i' m stupid ?
i remember our wedding .
it was an agency implant .
falling in love .
implanted .
our friends , my job , 8 years together .
all of this was implanted ?
the job' s real .
the agency set it up .
bullshit .
they erased your identity and implanted a new one .
i was written in as your wife so i could make sure the erasure took .
sorry , quaid .
your whole life is just a dream .
okay , then if i' m not me , who the hell am l ?
beats me .
i just work here .
there' s something i want you to know .
you were the best assignment i ever had .
really .
i' m honored .
you sure you don' t want to , just for old times ' sake ?
if you don' t trust me , you can tie me up .
i didn' t know you were so kinky .
maybe it' s time you found out .
clever girl .
you wouldn' t shoot me , doug , after all we' ve been through .
some of it was fun .
nice knowing you .
don' t touch her .
nobody here .
are you okay ?
i guess i blew it .

nothing , so far .
i' ve got him .
he' s going for the subway .
let' s go .
let' s go .

that' il muffle the signal .

we hope you enjoyed the ride .
howdy , stranger .
this is hauser .
if things have gone wrong , i' m talking to myself ... and you' ve got a wet towel wrapped around your head .
whatever your name is , get ready for the big surprise .
you are not you .
you are me .
no shit .
six beta nine , six beta nine , come in .
did you find him ?
we picked up an explosion at the old cement factory .
send two units .
we' il meet you there .
all my life i' ve worked for mars intelligence .
i did cohaagen' s dirty work .
but recently i met somebody a woman and i learned a few things .
i' ve been playing for the wrong team .
all i can do now is try to make up for it .
there' s enough shit in here to fuck cohaagen good .
but if you' re listening to this , that means he has got to me first .
here comes the hard part .
now it is all up to you .
great .
what have we got ?
nothing here .
he' s gone .
i got a weak signal over there .
find him .
first let' s get rid of that bug in your head .
take this thing out of the case and stick it up your nose .
don' t worry .
it' s self guiding .
just shove real hard .
when it crunches , you' re there .
just pull it out .
be careful .
it' s my head too .
i' ve got a lock .
up .
let' s go .
this is the plan .
get your ass to mars ... go to the hilton and flash the brubaker l . d. at the desk .
that' s it .
just do what i say and we can nail that bastard who fucked you and me .
i' m counting on you , buddy .
don' t let me down .
straight ahead .
in there .
there !
give me that .
shit .
get your ass to mars get your ass to mars
welcome to the mars federal colony .
for your safety and comfort , domes have been installed ... to protect you from the vacuum outside .
please do not touch exterior windows or air locks .
air volume is limited .
no smoking is allowed anywhere in the colony .
next .
thank you , and enjoy your stay on mars .
passport .
get out of the way .
make way !
stand back .
mr. cohaagen wants to see you right away .
any news of quaid ?
not since you lost him .
watch your mouth , captain .
how long do you plan to stay ?
two weeks .
look at that shit .
what the hell' s this ?
the martians love kuato .
they think he' s fuckin ' george washington .
kill the bastard .
nobody knows who he is .
have you brought any fruits or vegetables ?
two weeks .
excuse me ?
two weeks .
it' s not just graffiti .
the rebels took over the refinery last night .
the rebels took over the refinery last night .
no terbinium is going out .
and it gets worse .
quaid .
that' s quaid !
where ?
the woman !
get him her !
arrest that woman !
grab her !
catch !
get ready for a surprise !
open the goddamn door !
i can' t !
open it !
they' re all connected !
a few days ago cohaagen raised the price of air .
again ?
nobody on earth cares about mars .
they just want our terbinium so they can fight their war .
excuse me .
what' s that ?
you mean the pyramid mine ?
i used to work there until they found that alien shit inside .
well , that' s a rumor , isn' t it ?
think so ?
mr. cohaagen .
you wanted to see me , sir ?
richter ... do you know why i' m so happy ?
no , sir .
because i' ve got the greatest job in the solar system .
as long as the terbinium keeps flowing , i can do anything i want .
anything .
in fact ... my only worry is that one day ... if the rebels win ... it all might end ... and you' re making it happen !
first you try to kill quaid , then he escapes .
he had help from our side , sir .
i know that .
but i thought  who told you to think ?
i don' t give you enough information to think .
you do what you' re told .
that' s what you do .
yes , sir .
let' s get to business .
we' ve got a tricky situation here .
kuato wants what' s in quaid' s head .
he might be able to get it .
they say he' s psychic .
i have a plan to keep this from happening .
suppose you could play along ?
yes , sir .
great .
otherwise , i' il erase your ass .
you need a taxi ?
i got magazines , music , whisky .
you need a cab ?
come on !
can i help you ?
i would like a room , please .
nice to have you back , mr. brubaker .
would you like the same suite ?
definitely .
you' ve left something in our safe .
could you get it ?
identification ?
i' il encode your room key .
thank you .
suite 610 in the east wing .
thank you .
could i borrow your pen , please ?
certainly .
thank you .
hey , man , you need a cab ?
what' s wrong with this one ?
he ain' t got five kids to feed .
where' s yours ?
right over there .
hey , asshole !
that' s my fare !
eat this !
damn you , benny !
welcome to mars , man !
what was that , an accident ?
that' s the rebels .
let' s get outta here ... before they arrest us !
what do the rebels want ?
the usual .
more money , more freedom , more air .
so , where to ?
last resort .
you' re getting off to an early start .
first time on mars ?
yes .
well , actually , no .
well , sort of .
the man don' t even know whether he' s been to mars or not .
voila .
venusville .
hey , you see anything you like ?
end of the line .
we' d better walk from here .
i' il show you where .
do you want to know the future ?
what about the past ?
it' s around the corner , right down this alley .
they got everything .
not bad , huh ?
read your palm ?
your mind ?
your aura ?
probe the secrets of your heart ?
i bet i can guess your birthday .
you' re a taurus , right ?
how did you guess ?
tell me , are all psychics  freaks ?
afraid so .
it goes with the territory .
what happened to them ?
cheap domes , no air to clean the rays .
this is it .
the last resort .
you sure you want to go in here ?
why not ?
there' s a better place down there .
the girls are cleaner , the liquor ain' t watered down
sure , and you get kickbacks .
hey , man , i got five kids to feed .
take them to the dentist .
thanks , mister !
i' il be waiting for you .
take your time .
benny' s the name .
what do you want ?
melina .
she' s busy .
but mary here , she' s free .
well , not free , honey , but ... available .
thanks .
i' il wait for melina .
earth slime .
thing is , friend , mel' s real picky .
she sticks to her regulars .
she' il like me .
mel !
hello , hauser .
still bulging , i see .
what you been feeding this thing ?
blondes .
i think it' s still hungry .
you got a lot of nerve showing your face around here , hauser .
look who' s talking .
hey , tony , give the big guy a break .
relax .
you' il live longer .
come on .
honey , take care of tony , will you ?
no problem .
if you need any help with this one , give me a holler .
you son of a bitch .
you' re alive ?
i thought that cohaagen tortured you to death .
well , i guess he didn' t .
and you couldn' t get me a message ?
you never wondered what happened to me ?
hauser , thank god you' re alive .
melin melina .
melina .
i have to tell you something .
what ?
i don' t remember you .
what are you talking about ?
i don' t remember you .
i don' t remember us .
i don' t even remember me .
did you get amnesia ?
how did you get here ?
hauser left me a note .
you' re hauser .
not anymore .
now i' m quaid .
douglas quaid .
hauser , you' ve lost your mind .
no , cohaagen stole it .
he found out that hauser switched sides , so he turned him into somebody else : me .
this is too weird .
he dumped me on earth with a wife and a lousy job
did you say wife ?
are you fucking married ?
she wasn' t really my wife .
oh , she isn' t ?
how stupid of me .
she was hauser' s wife ?
forget that i said wife .
let' s just forget everything .
i' m sick of hearing your goddamn lies .
why would i lie to you ?
because you' re still working for cohaagen .
don' t be ridiculous .
you never loved me , hauser .
you just used me to get inside .
inside what ?
i think you' d better leave .
melina , hauser sent me to do something .
i' m not falling for it .
he says there' s enough in here to nail cohaagen for good .
get out !
you' ve got to help me remember !
i said , get out !
melina , please !
people are trying to kill me .
really ?
all right , i' m leaving .
baby , you make me wish i had three hands .
i think you' re doing just fine with two .
excuse me , baby .
we' il pick this up later .
hey , that didn' t take long .
let me ask you a question .
did you ever fuck a mutant ?
take me to the hotel .
i know these siamese twins .
man , you won' t know if you' re coming or going .
this afternoon at 4 : 30 p . m . , i signed an order declaring martial law ...
this afternoon at 4 : 30 p . m . , i signed an order declaring martial law ... throughout the mars federal colony .
i will not tolerate any further damage to our mineral export operations .
mr. kuato and his terrorists must understand ... that their self defeating efforts will only bring misery and suffering
mr. quaid ?
what ?
i need to talk to you about mr. hauser .
who are you ?
dr. edgemar from rekall .
how did you find me ?
it' s difficult to explain .
could you open the door ?
i' m unarmed .
don' t worry .
i' m alone .
may i come in ?
what do you want ?
this will be hard for you to accept .
i' m listening .
you' re not really standing here now .
doc , you could have fooled me .
i' m quite serious .
you' re not here and neither am l .
that' s amazing .
where are we ?
at rekall .
you' re strapped into an implant chair ... and i' m monitoring you from the psychoprobe console .
ah , i get it .
i' m dreaming .
and all this is part of the delightful vacation your company has sold me .
not exactly .
what you' re experiencing is a free form delusion based on our memory tapes ... but you' re inventing it yourself as you go along .
if it is my delusion , who the hell invited you ?
i' ve been artificially implanted as an emergency measure .
i' m sorry to tell you this , but you' ve suffered a schizoid embolism .
we can' t snap you out of your fantasy ... and i' ve been sent in to try to talk you down .
how much is cohaagen paying you for this ?
think about it .
your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure .
everything after that the chases , the trip to mars ... the suite at the hilton are elements of your rekall holiday and ego trip .
you paid to be a secret agent .
bullshit .
it' s coincidence .
and what about the girl ?
brunette , athletic , sleazy and demure ?
just as you specified .
is that coincidence ?
she' s real .
i dreamt about her before i even went to rekall .
mr. quaid .
can you hear yourself ?
she' s real because you dreamed her ?
that' s right .
maybe this will convince you .
would you mind opening the door ?
you open it .
no need to be rude .
i' il do it .
sweetheart ?
come in , mrs. quaid .
i suppose you' re not here either .
i' m here ... at rekall .
i love you .
right .
that' s why you tried to kill me .
no .
i' d never do anything to hurt you .
i want you to come back to me .
bullshit .
what' s bullshit , mr. quaid ?
that you' re having a paranoid episode triggered by acute neurochemical trauma ?
or that you' re really an invincible secret agent from mars ... who' s the victim of an interplanetary conspiracy to make him think ... he' s a lowly construction worker ?
stop punishing yourself , doug .
you' re a fine , upstanding man .
you have a beautiful wife who loves you .
your whole life is ahead of you .
but you' ve got to want to return to reality .
let' s assume i do .
then what ?
swallow this .
what is it ?
it' s a symbol of your desire to return to reality .
inside your dream , you' il fall asleep .
all right , let' s say you' re telling the truth and this is all a dream .
then i could pull this trigger and it won' t matter .
doug , don' t .
it won' t make a difference to me .
but the consequences to you would be devastating .
in your mind i' il be dead .
with no one to guide you out , you' il be stuck in permanent psychosis .
doug , let dr. edgemar help you .
the walls of reality will come crashing down .
one minute you' il be the savior of the rebel cause , and right after that ... you' il be cohaagen' s bosom buddy .
you' il even have fantasies about alien civilizations , as you requested ... but in the end , back on earth you' il be lobotomized !
so get a grip on yourself , doug , and put down that gun !
good .
now take the pill and put it in your mouth .
swallow it !
go ahead , sweetheart .
now you' ve done it .
now you' ve done it !
that' s for making me come to mars .
you know how much i hate this fucking planet !
cuff him .
i got him .
bring him down in the service elevator .
let' s go .
fuck you !
doug .
honey ... you wouldn' t hurt me , would you , sweetheart ?
sweetheart , be reasonable .
after all , we' re married .
consider that a divorce .
that was your wife ?
what a bitch .
hey , get out of the way !
i thought you didn' t like me .
if cohaagen wants you dead , you might be okay .
got it .
so you' ve come back to apologize .
kuato wants to see you .
come on .
now what ?
jump !
no !
don' t do it !
you' il crack the fucking dome !
what are you trying to do , kill us ?
the dome will crack !
move !
taxi !
melina !
melina !
need a ride ?
last resort .
you guys are going in circles .
jesus !
come on !
you drive !
you guys are in trouble ?
go !
go !
what are you trying to do to me ?
shut up and drive !
hey , i got five kids to feed !
shit !
no brakes !
you idiot !
what are you doing ?
christ !
now they' re after me !
give me that !
get out of the way !
tony !
get out of the way !
come on !
come on !
come on !
thank you , tony .
you wanna have some fun ?
where are they ?
what are you talking about ?
i don' t know .
maybe you know .
kill them all !
thumbelina !
richter !
a call from cohaagen !
richter here .
we' ve got them pinned down .
stop fighting and pull out .
but they' ve got quaid .
they' re protecting him .
perfect .
get out of sector g now .
don' t think .
do it !
yes , sir .
pull ' em out .
everybody , pull out !
move !
cohaagen' s sealing off the area !
come on , benny !
the first settlers are buried here .
they worked themselves to death , but cohaagen ended up with all the money .
he built cheap domes and watched the kids turn into freaks .
i saw them .
and if you want to breathe , you have to buy his air .
maybe you can change all that .
hey , i think my grandpa might be here .
so what can i do ?
kuato' s gonna make you remember some things you knew when you were hauser .
like what ?
all sorts of things .
maybe you' il remember you loved me .
i don' t need kuato for that .
since when ?
freeze !
come on , melina .
kuato' s waiting .
i didn' t find grandpa , but
oh , shit .
who' s this ?
he helped us get away .
hey , don' t worry about me , man .
i' m on your side .
you' re a mutant , huh ?
all right , let' s go .
have you tried ramming down the door ?
you wait here .
follow me .
it won' t do any good .
cohaagen depressurized the tunnels .
then drill through to section m.
we can' t .
we' re running out of air .
we need help .
sit tight .
melina just got here with quaid .
i hope he was worth it .
so do l .
i' m glad you made it .
you don' t look glad .
cohaagen sealed up venusville .
he shut off the air .
you must know something pretty important , quaid .
he wants you .
if we don' t hand you over , everybody in this sector will be dead by morning .
then we don' t have much choice .
we can' t turn him in .
that' s up to kuato .
come with me , quaid .
sit down .
where' s kuato ?
on his way .
you heard the rumors about the pyramid mine ?
yeah .
cohaagen found something weird inside and it' s got him scared shitless .
what ?
aliens ?
you tell me .
i don' t know .
yes , you do .
that' s why we brought you here .
cohaagen' s big secret is buried in that black hole ... you call a brain .
and kuato' s gonna dig it out .
you' re kuato , right ?
wrong .
kuato' s a mutant , so don' t get upset when you see him .
what do you want , mr. quaid ?
same as you : to remember .
but why ?
to be myself again .
you are what you do .
a man is defined by his actions ... not his memory .
please ... take my hands .
now open your mind to me .
please .
open your mind .
open your mind .
open your mind .
open your mind .
open your mind .
we should blow the thing up before the rebels turn it on .
i say we throw the switch and see what happens .
don' t be an idiot .
we can' t risk it .
the chain reaction could spread to all the terbinium in the planet .
that means a meltdown , a meltdown on a planetary scale .
don' t you think whoever built this thing thought of that ?
who knows what the hell they thought ?
they weren' t human .
maybe it' s a trap .
maybe they want a meltdown .
we don' t even know if this piece of junk will work .
what is it ?
a million ?
half a million ?
about half a million .
half a million years old .
let' s make sure kuato
wake up !
wake up !
come on , wake up !
they found us !
shit !
let' s go !
wake up !
snap out of it !
come on !
they found us !
everybody out !
melina !
get moving !
get out !
get out !
everybody out !
get out !
get to the air lock !
follow me !
benny , come on !
benny !
i' m coming !
put these spacesuits on !
we' re going outside !
benny , hurry .
congratulations , quaid .
you led us right to him .
how can you do this ?
you' re a mutant .
i got four kids to feed .
so what happened to number five ?
shit , man .
you got me .
i ain' t even married .
now put your fucking hands in the air !
quaid .
quaid .
forget it , man .
his fortunetelling days are over .
start the reactor .
free mars .
mr. cohaagen would like to talk to you .
so this is the great man .
no wonder he kept out of sight .
well , my boy ... you' re a hero .
fuck you .
don' t be modest .
kuato is dead .
the resistance is completely wiped out , and you were the key to the whole thing .
he' s lying .
you two faced bastard .
you can' t blame him , angel .
he' s innocent .
you see , quaid , none of my people could get close to kuato .
fucking mutants could always sniff us out .
so hauser and i sat down and invented you , the perfect mole .
you know you' re lying .
hauser turned against you .
that' s what we wanted you to think .
the fact is , hauser volunteered to become doug quaid .
it was the only way to fool the psychics .
get your story straight .
this idiot has been trying to kill me ever since i went to rekall .
you don' t kill somebody you' re trying to plant .
he wasn' t in on it .
you set him off by going to rekall .
so why am i still alive ?
we gave you lots of help .
benny here .
my pleasure , man .
the guy with the suitcase , the mask , the money ... the message from hauser , all of that was set up by us .
sorry .
too perfect .
perfect , my ass !
you pop your memory cap before we can activate you .
richter goes hog wild , screwing up everything i spent a year planning .
frankly , i' m amazed it worked .
well , cohaagen ...
i have to hand it to you .
it' s the best mind fuck yet .
well , don' t take my word for it .
someone you trust wants to talk to you .
who is it this time ?
my mother ?
howdy , quaid .
if you' re listening to this , it means that kuato is dead ... and you have led us to him .
i knew you wouldn' t let me down .
sorry for the shit i' ve put you through , but hey ... what are friends for ?
i would like to wish you happiness and long life , old buddy ... but unfortunately , this is not gonna happen .
you see , it' s my body you' ve got there and i want it back .
sorry to be an lndian giver , but i was here first .
so adios , amigo .
and thanks for not getting yourself killed .
hey , maybe we' il meet in our dreams .
you never know .
you bastards !
let go of me !
ready ?
auto .
check .
ready to go , sir .
relax , quaid .
you' il like being hauser .
the guy' s a fucking asshole .
that' s not true .
he' s one of my best friends .
besides , he' s got a big house and a mercedes .
and you like melina , right ?
you' il get to fuck her every night .
that' s right .
she' s going to be hauser' s babe .
i' il bust his balls .
uh uh , princess .
we' re having you fixed .
you' re going to be respectful , compliant ... and appreciative , the way a woman should be .
mr. cohaagen , telephone .
yes ?
what is it ?
the oxygen level is bottoming out in sector g.
what do you want me to do about it ?
don' t do anything .
but they won' t last an hour , sir .
fuck ' em .
it' il be a good lesson to the others .
you got what you want .
give these people air .
my friend , in five minutes you won' t give a shit about the people .
fire it up , doc .
excuse me , doctor .
is he gonna remember any of this ?
not a thing .
oh , really ?
quaid , i' m having a party tonight .
why don' t you and melina drop by .
remind him , doc .
sure .
see you at the party .
keep still .
fighting just makes it hurt .
if you don' t keep still , you' il end up psychotic .
hey , don' t !
melina , hold on !
are you all right ?
are you still you ?
i' m not sure , dear .
what do you think ?
let' s get the hell out of here .
you have to make a decision , sir .
kill him .
it' s about goddamn time .
where are you going ?
to the reactor .
what reactor ?
the one in the mines .
come on !
people are dying , quaid !
stop !
we' ve got to get air !
the reactor makes air .
that' s cohaagen' s secret .
let' s go .
where' s this reactor come from ?
aliens built it .
aliens ?
are you sure about this ?
it' s just up ahead .
what the hell
quaid !
hey , quaid , you remember me ?
benny !
benny' s the name !
oh , that' s good !
i' m gonna drill you , sucker !
i' m gonna grind you up !
i' m coming !
i' m coming for you , baby !
what the fuck is this ?
damn this piece of martian junk !
hey , quaid , i' m gonna squash you !
benny , here !
where the fuck are you ?
screw you !
quaid , get over here !
what is it ?
there' s an opening .
i knew it .
this whole thing is one big reactor made out of terbinium .
cohaagen knows it makes air .
the bastard won' t turn it on .
of course not .
if mars had an atmosphere , he' d lose control .
see down there ?
it' s a glacier .
the whole core of mars is ice .
the reactor melts it ... and it releases the oxygen .
come on .
enough for everyone to breathe ?
sure .
enough for the whole planet .
if we turn it on in time .
come on .
come on !
hold on .
now !
son of a bitch .
go !
he' s got a hologram !
you think this is the real quaid ?
it is .
you' re coming with me !
see you at the party , richter .
don' t touch that !
get away !
get back !
what are you afraid of ?
turn it on .
impossible !
once the reaction starts , it' il spread to all the terbinium in the planet .
mars will go into global meltdown .
that' s why the aliens never turned it on .
and you expect me to believe you ?
who gives a shit what you believe ?
ln 30 seconds you' il be dead .
then i' il blow this place up and be home in time for corn flakes .
i didn' t want it to end this way .
i wanted hauser back .
but no .
you had to be quaid !
i am quaid .
you' re nothing !
you' re nobody !
you' re a stupid dream .
well , all dreams come to an end .
melina , hold on !
don' t do it !
we' il all die !
everybody will die !
quaid !
i can' t believe it .
it' s like a dream .
what' s wrong ?
i just had a terrible thought .
what if this is a dream ?
well , then kiss me quick before you wake up .
