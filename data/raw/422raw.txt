it sounds broken .
most likely .
i' il bet it was something nice .
this is an insurance form .
if you' il just sign here , here , and here ... ... we' il get the rest of the forms to you soon .
that' s a lovely dog .
do you mind if i pet him ?
i don' t give a rat' s ass .
oh , brother !
that' s fine .
i can finish the rest .
you just have yourself a good day .
take care now .
bye bye .
excuse me !
hds !
hds !
coming through !
got a package , people !
get away from the door .
what' s the matter with you ?
i said , get !
son of a bitch !
that was a close one !
unfortunately ... ... in every contest there must be a loser .
hungry , fellow ?
there you go .
no problem .
it gets flooded .
we' il just wait a few seconds .
or we can try it now .
putz !
come on !
get out !
get out !
assholes are closer than they appear !
give me a push while you' re back there .
alrighty , then !
it' s alive !
it' s alive !
my little baby , come here .
you missed mommy , didn' t you ?
yes , you did .
did daddy hurt you ?
i won' t let him .
no , i won' t .
he can keep the big tv , but he' s not gonna hurt my baby , no he' s not .
thank you , mr. ventura .
how can i ever repay you ?
a reward would be good .
there is some damage to my car , and i had to fill it with premium .
would you like for me to take your pants off instead ?
gee !
let me think .
sure .
people are real friendly around here .
ventura !
yes , satan ?
i' m sorry , sir .
you sounded like someone else .
never mind the wisecracks , ventura .
you owe me rent .
mr. shickadance , i told you , you' re my first priority .
i' m on a very big case right now .
check this out .
look at that .
that' s a true albino pigeon .
some rich guy lost it .
he' s offering a $25, 000 reward .
as soon as i find this bird ... ... you' re paid .
i heard animals in there .
i heard them again this morning , scratching around .
i never bring my work home with me .
oh , yeah ?
what' s all this pet food for ?
fiber .
wanna take a look inside ?
come on !
come on !
go ahead .
snoop around !
well ?
are you satisfied ?
just don' t let me catch you with an animal in here .
that' s all .
all right .
take care , now .
bye bye , then .
loser !
come to me , jungle friends .
roger , let me ask you one question .
how in hell do you lose a 500 pound fish ?
what ?
i' m sorry , i was just going to say ... ... that it' s not a fish .
it' s a mammal .
thank you , miss jacques cousteau .
she didn' t mean anything by that .
i don' t give a good goddamn about that fish !
fillet it and fast food it if you want to !
all i give a damn about is winning the super bowl !
my athletes have got to have their heads in the right place !
shit , roger !
you' ve been in this business a long time .
you know how superstitious these players are .
i have a quarterback that' s put his socks on backwards since high school .
i' ve got a linebacker that hasn' t washed his jockey strap in two years ... ... because he thinks flies are lucky .
i want that fish on that field super bowl sunday .
find the fish ... ... or find new jobs !
why did it happen now , two weeks before the super bowl ?
i' il tell you , it' s those animal rights activists !
animals were born free !
stop torturing snowflake !
that fish lives better than they do .
the police are checking into the animal rights groups .
have they called back ?
no , but i wanted to tell you , when i lost my cuddles ... ... i hired a pet detective .
a what ?
a pet detective .
thanks , martha , but we better leave this to professionals .
well , actually , he was quite good .
pet detection is a very involved , highly scientific process .
like a glove !
mr. ventura here to see you .
thanks , martha .
hi , i' m melissa robinson .
pleasure to meet you .
any trouble getting in ?
no , the guy with the rubber glove was surprisingly gentle .
security' s tight super bowl week .
why don' t you have a seat ?
i' il get right to the point .
our mascot was stolen from his tank last night .
are you familiar with snowflake ?
negative .
we got him from miami .
he' s a rare bottle nosed dolphin .
this is a new trick he was going to do for the halftime show .
let' s go .
blue 42 , blue 42 !
hut , hut !
all right !
come on , let' s go !
good boy !
would you like an ashtray ?
i don' t smoke .
it' s a disgusting habit .
the police came today .
apparently , the kidnappers came in through the back with a ...
four wheel drive van , loaded from the rear .
roger , how you holding up ?
if i' m walking funny it' s because i got two dozen reporters up my ass .
they' ve been asking me about snowflake all morning .
who' s he ?
roger podacter , meet ace ventura .
he' s our pet detective .
nice to meet you .
you came very highly recommended by martha mertz .
martha mertz ?
oh , yeah , the bitch !
pekingese , lost in highland park area .
she was half dead when i found her .
is that the tank ?
excuse me .
cops drain it ?
yes , this morning .
if i' m not back in five minutes ... ... just wait longer .
captain' s log , stardate 23 . 9 , rounded off to the nearest decimal point .
we' ve traveled back in time to save an ancient species from annihilation .
so far ... ... no signs of aquatic life , but i am going to find it .
if i have to tear another black hole , i' m going to find it !
i' ve got to , mister !
oh , great !
i' il try to head them off .
ace , get out of the tank .
i just can' t do it , captain !
i don' t have the power !
people !
i said , get out of the tank now !
for god' s sake , jim , i' m a doctor , not a pool man !
where' s snowflake ?
snowflake is not available right now .
roger , i' ve been waiting all day .
i got to get a shot of his new trick !
what , is he sick ?
people , people !
lassie must be missing .
make any good collars lately ?
or were they leashes ?
homicide , ventura .
how are you gonna solve that one ?
good question , aguado !
first , i' d establish a motive .
the killer saw the size of the bug' s dick and became insanely jealous .
then i' d lose 30 pounds porking his wife !
come on !
now , kiss and make up !
excuse me .
i' d like to ass you a few questions .
this is not the time , ace .
if einhorn come down here and see me talking to you or your ass , i' m history .
i can keep him under control .
you have to tell me who' s on the snowflake case .
i can' t do nothing for you on that .
my hands are tied .
all right , that' s it !
now it' s my turn !
five minutes alone , that' s all i need !
better look alive .
einhorn' s on her way down .
come on , now .
ace , please .
what' s that matter ?
afraid i' il make a stink ?
come on !
aguado' s working the case , all right ?
aguado !
good call !
we' re just a little busy now ... ... with murderers and burglaries and drug dealers .
things like that .
a missing dolphin isn' t exactly a high priority .
now you' ve pissed him off .
would you give me a break ?
i can' t hold him much longer !
my boss is coming !
okay , look .
we ran a check with local animal rights groups .
we checked out the taxidermists and we already checked on van rentals .
so far , nothing , nathin ' , nada .
all right ?
any unusual bets being made ?
of course !
this is super bowl !
what' d you find out about the tank ?
nothing .
tire tracks , an escape route .
a guard didn' t see anything .
that' s it ?
i swear .
now will you please get out of here before i get in trouble ?
thank you for your cooperation .
by the way , do you have a mint ?
perhaps some binaca ?
assholomio
osadomia
holy testicle tuesday !
what the hell is he doing here ?
i came to confess .
i was the second gunman on the grassy knoll .
spare me the routine .
i know you' re working the snowflake case .
may i suggest you yield to the experts on this one ?
we' il find the porpoise .
now i feel better .
of course , that might not do any good .
nobody' s missing a porpoise .
it' s a dolphin that' s been taken .
the common harbor porpoise has an abrupt snout ... ... while the bottle nosed dolphin , or tursiops truncatus ... ... has an elongated beak , cone shaped teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage .
but i' m sure you already knew that .
that' s what turns me on about you .
your attention to detail .
listen , pet dick ... ... how would you like me to make your life a living hell ?
well , i' m not really ready for a relationship , lois .
but thank you for asking .
maybe i' il give you a call sometime .
your number still 911 ?
alrighty , then !
excuse me .
is greg here ?
thank you !
what' s the password ?
new england clam chowder .
is that the red or the white ?
i can never remember that !
white ?
hey , woodstock !
hey , saint francis , how' s it going ?
super , thanks for asking .
i hope you' re having a lovely day .
do you ?
don' t i ?
so what are you up to ?
just watching the fishies .
you see those blips ?
that' s a norwegian whaling fleet .
i' m sending them new directional coordinates .
they' il find jimmy hoffa ... ... before they find any whales .
gravy !
so can you still tap into the aquatic supply stores in the area ?
of course i can .
why ?
i wanna trace the sale of equipment ... ... for transporting or housing a dolphin recently .
come on , i thought you had a challenge for me .
all right , we got marine winch , sling , feeder fish , 20, 000 gallon tank ...
wait a minute .
look here .
that' s a lot of equipment for a civilian .
ronald camp ?
the billionaire ?
billionaire and rare fish collector .
really ?
that is the face of the enemy .
always trying to get his greedy hands on endangered species .
hold on .
camp is connected with the dolphins ?
that subgenius gave them the land the stadium' s built on .
and look , he' s throwing another " i' m the richest man in the universe " party .
looks like it' s time for me to get myself a date .
i' m really going out on a limb here .
his social events are strictly a list .
the date started good , chuck , but before we got to the party , she tensed up .
if you do anything to embarrass me ...
what ?
like this ?
hi , captain stubing .
how are gopher and doc ?
permission to come aboard , sir .
i' m sorry , ladies .
glad you could make it .
thank you .
you look wonderful .
and who is he , a friend ?
no , this is ...
this is my date .
he' s a lawyer .
does he have a name , or should i call him " lawyer " ?
i' m sorry .
this is ace v ...
tom ace .
pleasure to meet you .
congratulations on all your success .
you smell terrific !
one of the first lessons we learned ... ... back at ... ... stanford was the growth of food poisoning claims against wealthy people .
one could make quite a lucrative law practice ... ... with little else .
how is everybody feeling tonight ?
very , very well , thank you .
look , honey ... ... there' s the hors d' oeuvres .
are you insane ?
there is no way that camp stole snowflake .
what are you trying to do ?
will you keep him occupied while i work my magic , please ?
smooshy , isn' t it ?
we got a few cases from my new dealer in paris .
excuse me , ron ... ... i need to use the bathroom .
i think it' s the pt .
sure , it' s over there .
stuff probably looks better on the way out .
he wasn' t feeling well earlier today .
gravy !
don' t worry , snowflake .
ace ventura' s here .
yummy !
snowflake !
here , snowflake .
i' ve got a snack for you .
they' re wonderful , aren' t they ?
yes , they certainly are .
no matter what' s going on in my life ... ... i can always watch them swim ... ... and be totally at peace .
it' s not snowflake !
it' s not snowflake !
it' s not snowflake !
are you sure your date is all right ?
it' s been an awfully long time .
who , tom ?
well , i' m sure he' s fine .
do not go in there !
i' m sorry .
i' il have the plumbing checked immediately .
do that !
if i' d been drinking out of the toilet , i might' ve been killed .
i' m sorry again , mr. ace .
what' re you doing ?
i' m sorry , ron .
what' s he doing ?
let' s go !
stop it !
i don' t even wanna know why your pants are missing !
you could' ve cost me my job !
so you found a pebble in snowflake' s tank .
i' il call cnn .
i found it in the filter , thank you .
and it' s not a pebble , it' s a rare , triangular cut orange amber .
what' re you talking about ?
tonight i saw the same stone in camp' s ring .
i thought you said camp didn' t do it .
no , his ring wasn' t missing a stone .
but whoever was in that tank had a ring just like his .
ring ?
what ring ?
the 1984 dolphin afc championship ring .
i find the ring with a missing stone , i find snowflake .
how you gonna do that ?
simple .
loser !
why don' t you learn how to drive , pal ?
you wanna play ?
damn it !
that stone could' ve come from anywhere .
it could' ve come from ... ... a necklace or a pendant , an earring .
it came from an ' 84 afc championship ring .
einhorn thinks it may have been an animal rights group .
you know fan ?
free animals now , started by chelsea , daughter of industrialist fisher gamble ?
over half a million members worldwide ?
no .
who are they ?
did you know ... ... they sent letters to college teams demanding the release of their mascots ?
what do you feed your dog ?
dog food .
why ?
he is miserable !
what are you talking about ?
he' s very unhappy .
i feel sorry for him .
bad diet , isolated environment .
it' s amazing he' s still alive .
you' re just mad because your stupid pebble theory didn' t work out .
you can' t express anger .
yeah ?
and you' re ugly .
i' m not even gonna talk to you .
would you please leave ?
why ?
so you can beat him ?
fatty !
you' re unbelievable !
hiring you was the biggest mistake i ever made .
well , why don' t you cry about it , saddlebags ?
you like her , huh ?
yeah , she' s all right .
look , melissa , i ...
i' m here at the north beach towers condo complex in north miami ... ... where roger podacter , head of operations for the miami dolphins ... ... has apparently committed suicide ... ... allegedly leaping to his death from his 20th story balcony ...
you okay ?
i told you .
i was in my apartment ... ... across the hall .
i heard a scream ... ... so i called the manager .
the place was empty , except for the dog .
i opened the balcony door and looked out ... ... splat , bang , pancake time .
okay , thank you very much .
hi there , fella .
have a bad night ?
so ... ... animals can sense evil .
who let dr. doolittle in ?
lieutenant , he came with miss robinson .
this is police business .
we' il let you know if the coroner finds a tick .
face it ...
forget it .
she' s right .
besides ... ... i wouldn' t want someone tracing my steps , pointing out my mistakes .
so ... ... you don' t think this is an obvious suicide , mr. pet detective ?
i wouldn' t say that .
there' s plenty of evidence here to support your theory .
except , of course , for that spot of blood on the railing .
may i tell you what i think happened ?
alrighty , then !
roger podacter went out after work , had a few drinks , then came home .
he wasn' t alone .
someone else was with him .
there was a struggle ... ... and he was thrown over that balcony .
roger podacter didn' t commit suicide .
he was murdered .
that' s a very entertaining story ... ... but real detectives have to worry about that little thing called ... ... evidence .
i think i heard a toilet flush .
maybe somebody lost a turtle .
well , i ...
i guess i' m out of my league here .
good work .
there is just one more thing , lieutenant .
this woman is roger podacter' s neighbor .
she said she heard a scream .
right ?
and you had to open the balcony door when you came in ?
that' s true .
you' re sure you had to open this door ?
i' m certain .
what' s the point , ventura ?
only this .
this is double paned , soundproof glass .
there is no way ... ... she could have heard podacter scream on the way down .
the scream she heard came from inside ... ... before he was thrown off the balcony .
the murderer closed the door upon going .
can you feel that , buddy ?
i have exorcized the demons !
this house is clear .
losers .
get him out of here !
losers !
losers !
let' s go , ace .
losers .
come on .
back to the zoo .
what are you thinking ?
this whole thing is connected , somehow .
i want to find that other ring .
ace , you checked all the rings .
receipts ?
what about receipts ?
there' s gotta be receipts .
that was pretty impressive , what you did at the apartment .
you don' t have to tell me .
i was there .
maybe you should' ve joined the police force , become a real detective .
i don' t do humans .
you really love animals .
if it gets cold enough .
no , i have a kinship with them .
i understand them .
wanna hear something spooky ?
sure .
one time when i was about 12 , i had a dream that i was being followed by ... ... a big dog with rabies .
he had these bloodshot eyes ... ... and foam came out of his mouth .
no matter how fast i ran , he just kept gaining on me and gaining on me .
then just before i got to my front door ... ... he jumped and sank his teeth in .
that' s when i woke up ... ... and felt the back of my neck .
check that out .
bastard !
i' m sorry , i just couldn' t help myself .
want to know why i do this ?
i' m not sure anymore .
you better be sure ... ... because once you get inside my head ... ... there' s no turning back .
so ...
are these all ?
there' s only a dozen .
maybe it' s in another file , in the back .
who the hell is that ?
what ?
that .
who the hell is that ?
that' s ray finkle , the kicker .
don' t you know who he is ?
why isn' t he in this picture ?
this was taken earlier in the year .
ray finkle wasn' t added till mid season .
he missed the final field goal in the super bowl that year .
cost the dolphins the game .
but he got himself a ring , didn' t he ?
definitely .
replacement kicker having a great year .
ready for super bowl , all star kicker boasts .
field goal sails wide , dolphins lose super bowl .
the kick heard round the world .
that was finkle .
the dolphins lost by one point .
poor guy .
poor guy with a motive , baby .
where is he now ?
i heard he went back to his hometown in collier county .
really ?
you' re gonna drop me off before you go ?
no way .
you shouldn' t be left alone right now .
it might not be safe at your apartment .
what do you suggest ?
oh , my god !
oh , my god .
three times ?
i' m sorry , that' s never happened to me before .
i must be tired .
okay , i' m ready again .
i' m looking for ray finkle ... ... and a clean pair of shorts .
what do you know about ray finkle ?
soccer style kicker .
graduated from collier high , 1976 .
stetson university honors graduate , 1980 .
holds two ncaa records .
most points and distance .
nickname , " the mule .
the only pro athlete from here .
and one hell of a model american .
are you another one of them hard copy guys ?
no , sir .
i' m just a big finkle fan .
this is my graceland , sir .
will you put that gun down ?
the boy is a fan of our son .
so nice to meet you .
i' m ray' s mother ... ... and this is ray' s father .
it' s a real honor !
it' s an honor to have you here .
my ray is so appreciative of his fans .
he' il be so pleased you stopped by .
are you expecting ray anytime soon ?
oh , yes .
i expect him home any minute .
would you like some cookies ?
i just baked them .
yummy !
ray finkle' s house .
i can' t wait to meet him .
ray ain' t coming home .
but your wife expects him any minute .
she expects him home any minute .
see , the engine' s running but there' s nobody behind the wheel .
eight years ago ... ... our son escaped from shady acres mental hospital .
and they' re still bugging us to pick up his stuff .
it was all that dan marino' s fault .
everyone knows that .
if he' d held the ball laces out , like he' s supposed to ... ... ray wouldn' t have missed the kick .
dan marino should die of gonorrhea and rot in hell .
would you like a cookie , son ?
what do you know ?
they' re little footballs .
laces out .
when ray gets back and starts kicking again ... ... he' il never even know he was gone .
i' ve kept his room just the way he left it .
oh , boy !
what a sports nut , huh ?
may i ?
oh , yes , by all means .
five seconds to go here in super bowl 17 .
dolphins trailing the 49ers ... ... by one .
this will win the game for miami .
there' s the snap .
marino holds .
the kick ... ... and it' s high .
no , it' s ... ... no good .
ray finkle blew a 26 yard field goal !
i don ' t believe it !
the dolphins lose !
the dolphins lose !
the dolphins lose the super bowl !
melissa , it' s ace !
where are you ?
i' m in psychoville , and finkle' s the mayor .
where' s marino ?
why ?
he' s about to join snowflake .
i' ve gotta know where he is !
he has a commercial shoot at the bogart sound stage .
call the police .
get extra security over there .
now !
ace , what' s going on ?
thought i left ?
i' m really gonna go this time .
here we go , folks .
very quiet .
action !
i' m dan marino , and if anyone knows the value of protection , it' s me .
so i take care of the hands that take care of me ... ... with isotoner gloves !
cut !
again from the top .
i said , cut !
guys , it' s a cut !
what the hell are they doing ?
that' s a cut !
what is this , a rewrite ?
shut up !
where' d they go ?
over there !
let' s go !
excuse me , gentlemen !
pet detective !
come on !
what' s wrong ?
can' t you hit me ?
have there been ransom demands ?
there' s no communication with the kidnappers .
will the super bowl be postponed ?
the game is on as scheduled .
why weren' t we told about the kidnapping ?
secrecy was essential .
we couldn' t risk any interference .
are the crimes related ?
i' m sorry , i can' t comment further .
now , if you' il excuse me ...
get me the autopsy on podacter !
no one talks to the press !
and somebody get me some coffee !
tonight on miami vice , crockett gets the boss a coffee !
when i get out of that bathroom , you' d better be gone !
is it number one or number two ?
i just wanna know how much time i have .
by the way , i went ahead and solved that ... ... pesky snowflake podacter marino thing .
you ever heard of a former dolphin kicker named ray finkle ?
all right , ventura ... ... make it quick .
i found a rare stone at the bottom of snowflake' s tank .
it belongs to a dolphin ' 84 afc championship ring .
it would' ve been a super bowl ring , but ray missed the kick .
blames the whole thing on marino .
we' re talking paranoid , delusional psychosis .
i saw the guy' s room .
cozy , if you' re hannibal lecter .
so how does roger podacter fit in ?
my guess is , finkle was snooping around .
podacter recognized him .
end of story .
as for snowflake , they gave him finkle' s number , taught him how to kick a goal .
finkle took it personally .
so where is finkle now ?
busted out of a mental institute .
he' s been plotting his revenge for years .
waiting for the perfect time to get back at them .
super bowl time .
man , i' m tired of being right !
congratulations .
you' ve done some fine detective work ... ... ace .
i' m sorry , could you speak into my good ear ?
i thought i heard you call me ace .
maybe i was wrong about you .
maybe you are more than just a pet dick .
your gun is digging into my hip .
what' s wrong ?
want me to read you your rights ?
maybe later .
what is it ?
that bony little bitch ... ... melissa robinson ?
you just don' t do anything for me .
down , boy !
everything okay in here ?
i heard some commotion .
fine , sergeant .
you want me to throw him out ?
why don' t you throw yourself out ?
yes , ma' am .
ace , i want you to leave everything to us .
i can' t do that , lieutenant .
i was hired to find snowflake .
when we find marino ... ... we' il deliver snowflake .
when i find snowflake ... ... i' il deliver marino .
melissa , it' s ace !
what are you doing here ?
it' s the middle of the night .
you have to commit me .
finkle escaped from shady acres .
they still have his stuff .
they aren' t gonna let us look around .
i know .
it' s a good thing i' m a master of disguise .
mrs. robinson ... ... i' m dr. handly .
now who is it you want us to look at ?
my brother ... ... larry .
i' m ready to go in .
just give me a chance !
i know there' s a lot riding on it , but it' s all psychological .
just gotta stay positive .
i' m gonna execute a buttonhook pattern , super slow mo .
let' s see that ... ... in an instant replay .
your brother won' t be the first football pro we' ve treated .
is that right ?
yes , we' re very sensitive ... ... to the stress athletes have to endure .
i' m open !
i' m open !
i' m open !
we' il do some preliminary evaluations ... ... but i think he' il fit in nicely here .
over here !
351 !
351 !
rover , sit !
hut , hut !
he seems to have some difficulty letting go of the game .
has he had a history of mental illness ?
as long as i' ve known him .
this is one of our therapy rooms .
and we do arts and crafts out here in the courtyard .
and this is the storage room .
down the hallway we have another ...
halftime !
he' il be fine there by himself for the next 20 minutes .
i' il show you the dormitories , then .
isotoners .
obsess much ?
where are you going ?
to clean the storage room .
no , clean the cafeteria .
i don' t tell you how to do your job .
the schedule says ... ... clean the cafeteria .
i know what i' m doing .
you should' ve done it earlier .
man , come on .
cafeteria , my ass !
i' m cleaning in here !
you take breaks too long .
you smoke ...
man , you' re a pain in the ass !
search called off for missing hiker .

a hiker missing since friday ?
lois einhorn ?
holy shitballs !

a magical afternoon ... ... where dreams are made ... ... and crushed .

i don' t know .

in time , you could develop a tumor .
aguado , it' s lieutenant einhorn .
send some men over to the hallandale yacht basin .
i' ve got the kidnapper trapped in the warehouse .
it' s ace ventura , pet detective .
code 11 in progress , 343 victorville road ... ... at the palmdale basin .
officer needs backup .
ace ventura ... ... should be considered armed and dangerous .
it' s ace .

well , i have kissed a man .
of course , there' s never been a more crucial kick in a super bowl ... ... than the " kick heard around the world .
i mean , it' s clear to me that it was a good hold .
finkle just booted it .

you don' t understand ... ... she' s a ...
get him , lois !
get him !
get him !
shoot him !
shoot him !
hold your fire !
don' t shoot !
put your guns down , or this cop gets it !
i mean it !
she' s not joking !
he kidnapped snowflake !
he killed roger podacter and was about to kill marino and me !
fiction can be fun !
but i find the reference section much more enlightening .
for instance ... ... if you look up ... ... professional football' s all time bonehead plays ... ... you might read about a miami dolphin kicker named ray finkle ... ... who missed a 26 yard field goal in the closing seconds of super bowl 17 .
you wouldn' t read that finkle was committed to a mental hospital ... ... only to escape and join the police ... ... in a scheme to get even with marino ... ... whom he blamed for the entire thing !
what are you talking about ?
she' s not lois einhorn !
she' s ray finkle !
she' s a man !
he' s lying !
shoot him !
let' s just see who' s lying , shall we ?
would a real woman have to wear one of these ?
boy , that' s really on there !
would a real woman ... ... be missing these ?
that kind of surgery can be done over the weekend .
but i doubt very much ... ... if he could find the time during his busy schedule ... ... to get rid of ... ... big old ... ... mr. knish !
oh , boy !
come here .
would you excuse me for just one second ?
ladies and gentlemen ... ... my esteemed colleague , mr. marino ... ... brought new evidence to my attention .
now ... ... history has certainly shown that even the most intuitive ... ... criminal investigator can be wrong .
but if i am mistaken ... ... if the lieutenant is indeed a woman ... ... as she claims to be ... ... then , my friend ... ... she is suffering from the worst case of hemorrhoids i have ever seen !
that' s why roger podacter is dead !
he found captain winkie !
good night !
you' ve been a wonderful audience .
be sure to tip your waitress .
die , animal boy !
quick decision .
loser !
you have any more gum ?
that' s none of your damn business .
stay out of my personal affairs .
you' re a weird guy , ace .
a weird guy .
snowflake !
and now ... ... returning for the second half , the dolphins ' most valuable player ... ... dan marino !
idiot !
do you know what you' ve done ?
you just cost me 25 grand , polly .
yeah ?
blow me !
really ?
the national football league ... ... would like to offer a special thank you to the man who rescued dan marino ... ... and our beloved snowflake .
mr. ace ventura !
get off me !
get off me !
tone , put that big ass size 13 on and kick it for the homies .
