the u. s. military presence abroad was rocked today when a bomb exploded
in the army barracks in dhahran , saudi arabia .
a multinational force
ripped the front offthe 8 story military dorm , exposingjust how vulnerable u. s. troops are here .
and marines on duty seem , for the most part , numbed by the horror ofthe morning bombing .
early indications suggest this to be the work ofsheikahmed bin talal , a radical fundamentalist cleric known to have issued
the explosion appears to be the work ofterrorists .
and ifthat is the case ,
like all americans , i am outraged by it .
the cowards who committed this murderous act must not go unpunished .
sand leader , this is eagle eye .
we have a fix on the package .
it is in a mercedes sedan traveling south
com sat 1 , your coordinates are as follows .
1 8 0 5 0 .
package is approaching target area .
estimated time ofcontact is approximately 1 4 seconds .
yallah !
yallah !
let me say again .
america takes care ofour own .
those who did it must not go unpunished .
eagle eye , this is sand leader .
the sheik is in our custody .
he is alive and well , and will be delivered intact by 0800 tomorrow .
fbl .

they' re going in now .
how soon can we get there ?
this time ofday ?
maybe tomorrow .
oh , fuck .

and nobody' s hurt ?
this is our first and last warning .
we expect our demands to be met .
there will be no negotiation .
no more communication ofany kind .
that is all .
demand forwhat ?

maybe it' s a prank .
some sense ofhumor .
here' s what i know .
b. p. , as in blue paint .
voice altering technology .
what doyou think ?
available from the sharperlmage catalog .
last i looked , they didn' t have an exploding paint bomb .
still , the rhetoric sounds political .
you think it' s militia ?
no , not their style .
frank ?
islamicjihad aren' t known for their sense ofhumor , and hamas is raising so much money here .
why queer their deal ?
isn' t green the color oflslam , not blue ?
another good point .

itjust occurs to me
has anyone committed a crime here ?
i mean assault with a deadly color ?
here' s what i don' t like .
they know explosives .

hmm .
okay , i can understand .
whywe wouldn' t want to advertise the fact that , uh , our government' s in the kidnapping business , but why not let us know ?

mine , yours , the israelis , the saudis .
one time or another , everybody in the middle east is sleeping with everybody else .
soyou' re saying you sleep around .
only professionally .

call i. n. s. , check samir' s status , start deportation procedures .
i can' t letyou do that .
oh , you can' t let me do that .
what precisely is your involvement with these people , elise ?
samir has been a very important project ofmine for some time .
i' m the only one he' il deal with .
he' s verywell connected and extremely high strung .
call i. n. s. , frank .
how easy is it to get inside , frank ?
how good areyour sources in the community ?

no surveillance .
i' ve seen your deft touch .

and i run him .
we share him .

he can' t know we' re talking .
i won' t tell him .

i need you to help me .
i need you to be strong ,
likeyou' ve always been strong , for both ofus .
samir , look at me .
look at me .
go .
yeah , frank ?
you know , some peoplejust cannot live in the camps .
for my brother , it was already like dying .
the only thing he lives for is movies .
and then some sheik came and tell him that ...
to die forallah is beautiful .
and ifhe does this thing , our parents will be taken care of , and he will live on in paradise with 70 virgins .
i mean ...
70 .
and my brother , he need to believe it very much .
so he straps 1 0 sticks ofdynamite to his chest .
and he went to the movie .
and then i become a v. i. p.
it' s very confusing .
so who areyou afraid ofbetraying ?
we know these people .
they bomb , they maim .
they represent the palestine you want to build ?
they' re using you .
you are using me , too .
everybody uses the palestinians .
hey .

and what about fucking me ?
i had to get special permission for that .
beats the shit out ofcable .
he asked to wait inside .
good morning .
bill devereaux .
i know whoyou are .
i was with the 82nd
airborne .
yeah , i know .
i was in the 1 73rd at the time .
god , duty , honor , country
remember ?
mm hmm .
where on capitol hill orwall street or hollywood haveyou heard anyone utter one ofthose phrases in the last 1 0 years ?
what brings you to new york , general ?
the president' s concerned .
he' s worried that haveyou met the president ?
uh , no , i haven' t .
i read the newspapers , though .
i know he' s concerned about terrorism .
well , with all due affection for the man , the president doesn' t know fuck all about the mideast or terrorism that i don' t write on his cue cards .
he is an expert in covering his own ass , ifyou catch my meaning .
yes , i do .
so i guess you didn' t come up here just for a cup ofcoffee , huh ?
with all due respect ,
i thinkwe' re on the right track .
that' s exactly what i told the president .
the army' s not some big green police machine .
stickwith the men on the ground is what i advised the president .
well , i appreciate your support .
as long as you' re sureyou' re not chasing your tail here .
so what can you tell me about the sheik ahmed bin talal ?
just that he' s old news .
but we received 2 communications from the bombers to release him .
we can' t release him .
i know our stated policy is to never negotiate
we can' t release him because we don' t have him .
we never did .
our latest intel says that he' s dead .
the agency doesn' t think so .
the cla didn' t know the berlin wall was coming down until bricks started hitting them in the head .
who' s your source ?
elise kraft .
a woman will never understand the middle east .
just between you and me ,
elise kraft wouldn' t know a sheik from a prophylactic by the same name .
well , i , uh , appreciate the heads up .
hub , we followed up that tip on
why , elise , what a nice surprise .
how areyou ?
hello , general .
how nice to seeyou again .
please , don' t let me interrupt .
uh , sorry .

just like the bus .
we got ' em .
3 men were reported killed today after a shootout with the fbi in a quiet neighborhood in brooklyn .
already there are unconfirmed reports ofa link between the victims , who are reported to be arab speaking , and the bombers ofbus 87 .
fbi spokesman , anthony hubbard .
uh , we are presently following up on as many leads , and , uh , we' re confident that we' re on the right track .
i thinkwe' re all happy that these criminals are offthe streets , and we can all get on with our lives .
dad !
yeah !
i think the fbi deserves special recognition for the speed with which they handled this current crisis .
i' d especially like to single out
special agent tony hubbard and the men and women ofthe nypd , fbl ...
here we are .
drink up , everyone .
my first boyfriend was palestinian .
you know , my father used to say they seduceyou with their suffering .
haveyou ever been over there ?
haveyou seen the camps ?
no .
no , never been .
oh , there' s these incredibly warm , hospitable people ,
living in this horrible place .
butyetyou work against them .
only the crazy .
i tend to be suspicious ofall true believers , present company included .
areyou saying i' m a fanatic ?
why areyou a fed ?
you read my file .
you tell me .
okay .
all right , i' il tell you .
catholic school ...
st. raymond' s in the bronx .
president ofthis , captain ofthat , hard work , make a difference , fair play , change the system from within .
rah rah rah .
what ?
what aboutyou ?
what doyou believe ?
like what ?
like right and wrong .
it' s easy to tell the difference between right and wrong .
is it ? yes . what' s hard is choosing the wrong that' s more right .
i just ...
okay .
no , i just want to make things a little better , okay ?
ignore me .
i' m shitfaced .
elise .
elise .
frank .
ahh .
hi .
tell us all about being a spook .
come on .
it' s the bay of pigs .
you' re there on the beach with all the girl scouts .
i love the wayyou guys predicted the fall of the soviet union .
genius .
yeah , yeah , yeah , right .
andj .
edgar hoover wore a dress , right ?
mmm .
i love lebanese men .
come on , let' s dance .
come on , hub .
dance with me .
sure .
it' s yourwife .
oh .
oh, jeez .
this feels like high school .
yeah .
except my prom date didn' t wear a gun .
so what' s the latest on samir ?
i want a list ofevery visa he sponsored .
i' m not sure he' il do it .
no ?
you know , i once knew this undercover guy who cared so much for his source ...
he' s a source , period .
you ever consider the fact that he might be in bed with the other side ?
samir in bed with them ?
that would be too much to wish for .
you' re so confident .
only in bed .
it' s a broadway theater .
it went offjust as people were getting up for intermission .
there are bodies everywhere .
sir , help ' em !
they' re trapped inside !
no group has taken responsibility for the bombing yet so far as we know .
scores of the wealthiest and brightest of new york society were killed last night when a bomb ripped through a crowded theater .
the list ofvictims is a veritable who' s who ofthe city' s cultural leaders .
you can be sure that all of our considerable resources are being brought to bear on the situation .
new york city has been brought to its knees by the events ofthe past week .
retail sales are down 72 % .
hate crimes have skyrocketed .
and the fbi seems , at least for the moment , incapable ofstopping the terror .
once busy streets are eerily silent as many have fled .
ira , why do they let those people in the country ?
they know who those people are .
ifyou think i' m gonna let my kids out there with all this stuffgoing on , you have got to be crazy .
the senate intelligence committee today authorized a special panel to investigate the current situation in new york city .
tonight at 1 0 : 00 terrorism in the united states .
the worst kind ofreaction is a reaction that' s based on fear .
he says ifyou' re on the state department terrorist watch list , you cannot get into the country .
so i sayali waziri was on the watch list , and he got in .
what did the state department say ?
they told me to call i. n. s.
what did i. n. s. say ?
they told me to call state .
oh , god !
the purpose ofthis meeting is to keep our city safe , and your department' s responsibility
my department what , asshole ? is to keep us safe .
look , i' m very sorry , but we' re gonna have to raise our hands before we ask a question , okay ?
yes , sir ?
howard kaplan , i. n. s.
howyou doing , howard ?
good , thanks .
so , we pulled every ethnic visa in the city and traced them to the source .
danny ?
bring ' em in , and we talk to ' em .
what about translators ?
how many people we talking about here ?
1 , 600 , maybe more .
1 , 600 ?
that' s right .
where are we gonna put 1 , 600 people ?
danny , slow down , okay ?
yes , sir ?
what about a military presence atj fk and la guardia ?
i don' t thinkwe' re thereyet , and i don' t think it' s gonna stop these criminals .
sir ?
what about protecting the arab population ?
there' s a lot ofanger out there .
i represent the arab antidefamation league .
whatever injustices my people may be suffering at this very difficult moment , we will continue to show our commitment to this country .
i appreciate that . thankyou , sir .
and i want to thank everybody for their patience today .
this has been an extremely difficult
time .
london , paris ,
athens , rome ,
belfast , beirut
we' re not the first city to have to deal with terrorism .
in tel aviv
in tel aviv , the day after they bombed the market in tel aviv , the market was open , and it was full .
this is new york city ...
we can take it .
oh , my god .
it' s the buckley school .
not kids .
one ofthe moms was carrying a gun , wounds the guy as he' s planting the device .
he kills her , then he locks them all on the roof .
any kids get hurt ?
i don' t know .
it' s over there on the table .
i don' t know ifit' s a radio or a timer orwhat .
whoa , hold right there .
see ifyou can move in a little closer on the device .
right there .
focus that .
radio device .
he' s got a radio control .
what the fuck' s the news media doing here ?
they must have been monitoring our frequency .
danny , your boys were supposed to call the f. a. a. to clear the airspace !
i' m on it , i' m on it .
do it now .
this is nypd ...
get those fuckin ' birds out ofhere !
hub .
everybody out .
takeyour time .
need some help here .
all right , come on .
eitherwe answer this threat quickly and convincingly , or next week , there will be a hundred more all over the world .
sounds great , general .
why can' t we find out who' s behind it ?
it seems to me , gentlemen , that conventional law enforcement just isn' t up to the task .
how about who' s behind who' s behind this ?
either libya , iran , iraq , possibly syria .
ask a question , get an atlas .
all i know is that we must respond .
that' s an excellent idea , senator .
how do we do that ?
find out who they are and bomb the shit out ofthem .
and ifwe can' t find out ?
i hate to be the voice ofdoom , but it keeps escalating .
first a bus , then a theater .
what' s next ?
how about sending in the national guard ?
the national guard is for riot control , senator , not for counterterrorism .
the army then .
i' ve read the contingency plans .
it' s established legal doctrine posse comitatus . the army can' t be turned against our own people .
even ifthat' s what are own people are asking for , 3 to 1 ?
ifthe president' s willing to declare a state of
president lincoln declared martial law in 1 862 . he suspended habeas corpus .
which the supreme court
later found unconstitutional .
ex parte millegan .
and i' ve got an election in november
ex united states congressman .
let' s save the quips for the sunday morning talk shows .
the president' s plane lands in 2 hours , and we owe it to him to have a consensus .
you don' t fight ajunkyard dog with a. s. p. c. a. rules .
whatyou do is you take the leash offyour own bigger , meaner dog .
general .
the army' s a broadsword , not a scalpel .
trust me , senator , you do not want the army in an american city .
but hypothetically , how long would it takeyou to deploy ?
you know we can' t go in until the president invokes the war powers act .
i understand that , general .
let' s assume for a moment that the order has been given .
1 2 hours after the president gives the order , we can be on the ground .
one light infantry division of 1 0, 700 men .
elements ofthe rapid deployment force , special forces , delta ,
a. p. c. s , helicopters , tanks , and , ofcourse , the ubiquitous m 1 6 a 1 assault rifle .
a humble enough weapon until you see it in the hands ofa man outsideyour local bowling alley or 7 1 1 .
it will be noisy , it will be scary , and it will not be mistaken for a vfw parade .
i remind you , general devereaux does not speak for official army policy .
a police function has become accepted as our role in haiti and somalia .
make no mistake .
we will hunt down the enemy , we will find the enemy , and we will kill the enemy .
and no card carrying member ofthe aclu is more dead set against it than i am , which is why i urgeyou ...
i imploreyou ... do not consider this as an option .
i knowjust what the president' s going to say .
that' s exactlywhyyou' re the only man for thejob .
i' d like to introduce anthony hubbard .
he' s myasalc on the ground up in brooklyn .
his team was able to take out the first cell within 36 hours ofthe attack on the 87 bus .
he' s also the man who took out the terrorist in that schoolhouse .
hub .
thejob ofthe fbi is to ... to respond .
thejob ofthe army to defend .
with the presence ofthe army , our ability to investigate will be seriously inhibited .
it will push these criminals further underground .
most importantly , you can' t fight a war against an enemy you can' t see .
i think ifwe exercise patience , restraint , allow our men and women up in new york to do theirjob ...
i thinkwe' il be effective .
thankyou , agent hubbard .
i , too , think that we should proceed with caution .
some ofyou may not know sharon bridger .
sharon was posted in iraq as part of our covert operations during the gulfwar .
sharon .
sir , ifi may .
thankyou .
i' m sure everyone here knows the traditional model ofthe terrorist network .
one cell controls all others .
cut offthe head , the bodywill wither .
unfortunately , the old wisdom no longer applies .
the new paradigm is each cell operates independent ofthe other .
cut offone head , another rises up in its place .
bus 87 was the work ofthe first cell whose remaining elements , we believe , the fbi took down .
this then activated the work ofcell 2 .
the theater gala .
at the most , we believe , there are 3 , possibly 4 cells .
well , then how much longer before we can take out the last cell ?
we don' t know .
this is a tragedy ofstaggering proportion .
one federal plaza was the headquarters ofthe fbi counterterrorism task force , as well as many other federal agents ...
authorities are withholding the names ofthose who died .
the worst in new york city' s history .
the most devastating ...
letters ofcondolence have been received from leaders around the world .
boris yeltsin forwarded a message ...
body count' s a little over 200 so far .
what about our people ?
mike , tina .
theywere all in there working .
hub .
hub .
this is colonel hardwick , army intelligence .
colonel .
i' m here as an advisor only .
i intend to keep a low profile .
appreciateyour concern .
i don' t mean to be insensitive , but , uh, just what exactly are your capabilities at this point ?
your infrastructure ?
you' re standing on our infrastructure .
excuse me .
hey , hub , they managed to get a partial vi n number offthe van .
dmv says it was reported stolen the day before ... in brooklyn ?
you got it .
hub , the final body count just came in .
600 dead .
i' m very sorry aboutyour friends .
frank , it' s , uh ...
sharon .
i didn' t catch your last name , sharon .
bridger .
howyou doing , frank ?
been better .
well ... the agency came up with another list ofprobables .
i thinkwe should circulate them .
hey ... this stuffmight be good .
whywas there no warning from samir ?
because he didn' t know anything .
says samir .
says me .
maybe i' il ask him .
yeah , over my dead body .
over 600 dead bodies .
look , he' s one ofthe good guys , okay ?
how can you be so sure ?
because he was part ofthe operation to destabilize saddam hussein with me , okay ?
samir is a go between .
he risked his life for us over there .
go between who , sharon ?
look , come on , i need names , okay ?
i need i need photographs or something , okay ?
i don' t need a history lesson .
i can' t giveyou pictures because i don' t know what they look like .
we did everything at arm' s length .
soyou got nothing ?
i' ve got samir .
well , does samir have any contact with them ?
minimal .
so how does he do it ?
he can' t .
they initiate .
and otherwise ?
he' s waiting .
he' s he' s waiting ?
what the hell is he waiting for ?
more bodies ?
more buildings ?
we got a lot ofbuildings out there .
maybe he' s waiting to blow up a few more ofthem .
hey , look , i know howyou must feel .
hey , look , you don' t know how i feel .
i lost friends ofmine tonight .
you don' t know how i feel !
they' il make contact soon .
when ?
that' s what i want to know when ?
why soon ?
why not now ?
what is the trade craft ?
what are the visuals ?
what are the iron sights ?
you know , all that cla spy shit .
all right , i' il tell you what i' m going to do .
i' m going to take your boy samir downtown ,
i' m going to strap his ass to a polygraph machine , and i' m going to ask him questions aboutyou .
then i' m going to take those transcripts
i' m going to take them to a friend ofmine at the new york times whojust loves to write stories about the link between the cla and political horror shows .
ifyou burn him , you' il lose any chanceyou' ve got .
so what ?
it' s lose lose , isn' t that whatyou said ?
i' m not fucking with you .
how could you possibly rememberwhoyou' re fucking ?
24 hours .
forwhat ?
24 hours forwhat , sharon ?
elise .
have anything for me ?
nothing new .
now , we' ve got 3 bombings in new york city .
we' ve got 600 people dead .
the nypd , the fbl , they don' t seem up to it .
do we need to bring the army into this , arianna ?
absolutely .
how many people have to die before we do bring the army ...
u. s. government troops are not trained to police their own population .
that' s why we have an fbl .
that' s whywe have a police force .
no .
you see
we don' t want an occupying army in brooklyn .
i would imagine you would have to speak to the army to verify those rumors .
and here we have the fbi having failed to do theirjob , having failed ...
this is an attack .
this is a time ofwar .
the fact that it' s inside our borders only means that it' s a new kind ofwar .
this is the kind ofshit these towel heads do in their own country , and now they' re bringing it here .
people must understand that the word " arab " is not synonymous with the word " terrorist .
islam is a religion ofpeace .
these people defile the holy koran when they use ...
you know there' s a lot ofpent up frustration ...
a merchant , abdul hassam , was beaten today and his store vandalized .
the president released a statement today
one of our greatest freedoms is the freedom from fear , " and he pledged to protect that freedom with all the resources ...
the fbi has received another fax .
ahmed bin talal .
apparently , they' re still under the impression that we have him .
do we ... have him ?
let me giveyou a little advice , steve .
do not come between me and the president .
i am speaking for the president .
as far as the president is concerned , no , we do not have him .
general , did you know that afteryesterday' s attack halfthe parents in this country kept their kids out ofschool ?
they' re attacking ourway oflife .
it ends now .
areyou saying the president is prepared to take the necessary steps ?
i am saying the president is prepared to be presidential .
hello .
it' s me .
turn on the tv .
hang on .
the senate remained in emergency session
late into the night debating the president' s call for martial law .
we have , in this country , a tradition ofinvoking martial law ...
yeah , i got it . onlywhen the most dire ofcircumstances require it , but at what cost ?
all eyes now turn to new york city to see ifmartial law will bring the terror to an end .
move it !
good morning .
today , with the invocation ofthe war powers act by the president ,
i am declaring a state ofmartial law in this city .
to the best ofour knowledge , we are opposed by no more than 20 ofthe enemy .
he is hiding among a population ofroughly 2 million .
intelligence tells us that he is most likely arab speaking , between the age of 1 4 and 30 narrowing the target to 1 5, 000 suspects .
we can further reduce that number down to those that have been in this country
less than 6 months .
nowyou have 20 hiding among 2, 000 .
ifyou are one ofthese 20 young men , you can hide among a population ofsimilar ethnic background .
unfortunately foryou , you can only hide there , and that population , in the classic immigration pattern , is concentrated right here in brooklyn .
we intend to seal off this borough , then we intend to squeeze it .
this is the land ofopportunity , gentlemen the opportunity to turn yourselves in .
after sundown tonight , anyyoung man fitting the profile i described who is not cooperating will be arrested and detained .
there is historically nothing more corrosive to the morale ofa population than policing its own citizens , but the enemywould be sadly mistaken iftheywere to doubt our resolve .
they are now face to face with the most fearsome military machine in the history ofman , and i intend to use it and be back on base in time for the playoffs .
thankyou foryour time .
good to seeyou again , hub .
can' t say the same thing aboutyou , general not like this , not in that uniform .
i thought you were against this .
i am against this .
this was not my call .
soyou' rejust following orders , huh ?
the president madeyou put tanks on the brooklyn bridge ?
areyou questioning my patriotism ?
i' m questioning yourjudgment .
negative , command .
i' m here serving my president and quite possibly not in the best interest ofour nation .
my profession does not allow me to make that kind ofdistinction .
i won' t question your patriotism , but don' tyou ever again question my command .
doyou understand me ?
i' m not underyour command .
you really believe that , hub ?
take a look around and tell me that' s true .
arrogant prick .
you ever met anybody so in love with the sound ofhis own voice ?
we' re putting samir into play .
now ?
with all this going on ?
he' il freak .
yeah , he' il freak .
i' m already freaked .
the whole damn city' s freaked .
oh , fuck it one more lamb to the slaughter .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
it' s fine .
he' s cool .
what' s he fucking doing here ?
hey , doyou know what' s happened outside ?
they' re killing arabs out there .
you can put a stop to it , samir .
what areyou talking about ?
the army' s here .
they' re setting up interrogation centers right now .
they' re torturing people in cellars .
calm down , all right ?
i got to get out ofhere , and you have to help me .

well , i' m going to post it in every shop in brooklyn , and then i' m going to send copies to some friends ofmine in the west bank .
your mother' s still there , isn' t she ?
all right , all right !
fucking let go ofme !
all right , get out ofhere .
get out !
i' m sorry .
hey , nobody' s going to burn you , okay , samir ? nobody' s going to call anybody .

how long haveyou been at him ?
not long enough , apparently .
how much longer , doyou think , before he gives up the other cells ?
he can' t give up the other cells ifhe doesn' t know where they are .
he knows .
no , he doesn' t .
you said ityourself , sharon , didn' tyou ?
in the strategy meeting , the briefing
the one cell doesn' t know where the other one is , right ?
how long before he breaks , sharon ?
well , at this rate , too long .
the theaterwas hit 9 hours afterwe took down the first cell .
so ... what other models do we have ?
shake him ?
what about it , sharon ?
won' t work .
it works for the israelis .
only in conjunction with sleep deprivation .
it takes at least 36 hours .
we don' t have 36 hours .
electric shock ?
the neurotransmitters just shut down .
water ?
palestinian authorities ... producing good intel with water .
ofcourse , there' s cutting .
it' s extremely messy .
areyou people insane ?
what areyou talking about ?
the time has come for one man to suffer in order to save hundreds oflives .
one man ?
what about 2 , huh ?
what about 6 ?
how about public executions , huh ?
you' re free to leave wheneveryou like .
come on , general , you lost men , i' ve lost men , butyou you can' t do this .
what ifwhat they reallywant
what ifthey don' t even want the sheik ?
haveyou considered that ?
huh ?
what if what they reallywant is for us to herd children into stadiums
like we' re doing ?
and put soldiers on the street and and have americans looking over their shoulders ?
bend the law , shred the constitution just a little bit ?
because ifwe torture him , general ... we do that , and everything that we have bled and fought and died for is over , and they' ve won .
they' ve alreadywon .
escort him out .
aah !
he knew nothing .
aah !
you got to call offthe dogs .
we can' t call offthe army until the threat is gone .
the army is the threat .
they' re the ones out ofcontrol .
devereaux' s killing innocent people .
you guys took the leash offofhim .
just put it back on him .
areyou wearing a wire ?
areyou ?
it was devereaux who took the sheik in the first place .
devereaux ?
so we do have him ?
what doyou think , hub ?
our government operates as one coherent entity ?
everybody , you and me , we all wanted that sheik' s head on a plate .
devereaux didn' t start this agenda about hunting down terrorists .
he' sjust kind of pushed it a little bit .
hang on a sec .
so , now what do we do ?
there is this growing feeling in certain circles that we ought tojust let the sheik go set him free .
i mean , after all , we kidnapped him .
we kept him in isolation .
ajudge might let him walk .
you don' t let a murderer go free any murderer .
any murderer !
sharon thinks we can get to the last cell ifthey believe we' re going to release the sheik .
why should they trust her ?
i mean , why should i trust her ?
ask her .
i ran the network in iraq for 2 years .
samir recruited them from among the sheik' s followers , and i trained them in the north .
the sheikwas going to help us overthrow saddam .
i mean , he was our ally .
we were financing him .
and then ... then there was a policy shift .
it' s not like we sold them out exactly .
wejust stopped helping them .
theywere slaughtered .
so i quit the operation .
i took another assignment .
butyou helped them first .
what doyou mean ?
you said theywere being slaughtered .
they needed to get out .
theywere on the terrorist watch list , soyou got them visas , you and samir .
i promised them we would take care ofthem .
theywere working for us .
doing what exactly ?
i told you .
no , you didn' t .
you told me thatyou trained them trade craft , subversion .
that' s whatyou said , wasn' t it ?
you' re leaving something out , aren' tyou , sharon ?
you taught them ... how to make bombs .
that' s whyyou were looking for the wiring signatures on that blue bus .
and now they' re here ... doing whatyou taught them how to do .
right ?
you' ve got to let me make this right .
please ?
