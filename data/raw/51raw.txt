i' m 53 .
i' m out in the bush , out of shape , overweight ... a big , fat and immobile target .
a lot of guys had a lot worse than me .

why do i have to keep coming here to feel any better ?
what about you , dean ?
it' s your first time .
wanna share ?
yeah .
my name is dean cage .
i was in bosnia .
this a small war compared to what some of you guys have been through .
there ain' t no small war , brother .
no .
i guess there isn' t .
my friend , amy ... she' s more technically like ...
she' s my best friend' s sister .
you know , she and i ... it' s kinda complicated .
anyway , she suggested that i come .
they' re pouring gasoline on me .
because i' m ...
the bastards are gonna burn me !
i' m kinda stuck .
they' re gonna burn me , dean .
they' re gonna burn me .
if it' s alright with you guys , since it' s my first time here ...
i' d like to just sit this one out ... and listen if it' s okay with you guys .
of course it is , dean .
what the hell happened ?
the trucker said this guy came flying out of an ambulance .
that john doe over there , riding like a bronco .
the bastard took an up close of each tire .
is this the ambulance ?
no , another one .
where is it ?
that' s the thing .
the ambulance kept going .

does this make sense to anybody ?
not yet .
can you make up these letters here ?
what is that , an " m " ?
n " , " v " ?
i don' t know .
so , wanna tell me about it ?
did you fuck up ?
who told you to interrogate him after the injection ?
lietch , would you put your piece to his head , please ?
do as i ask , please .
you think i like this ?
lietch doesn' t like it , i know you don' t .
this is where we are , because you ... despite all your training , decided on actions ... that went outside the mission parameters , do you understand ?
wilson did say something .
the guy was snitching .
supposed to have a meeting .
we know when and where .
tonight ... diner , 7 o ' clock .
you can low your weapon now .
the point has been made .
of course , wilson can' t tell us what he told the feds .
the federal agent he' s been snitching to can .
well , why don' t we stick around and see who should up for coffee ?
how did it go ?
it' s still going on .
dean , you left ?
you know , look .
these guys ... they' re alright , but they' re kinda cuckoo .
i was thinking ... maybe we can meet up at some place .
there are some things i wanna tell you .
i don' t wanna tell them , i wanna tell you .
meet me at the diner .
7 o ' clock , ok ?
i' il see you there , baby .
alright .
bye .
macnab ...

peterson , i want you out in the street

so what this stuff is gonna do ?
what' s gonna do ?
it' s gonna make us very rich .
this is about all you need to worry right now .

you stick it in his arm , his leg .
doesn' t matter where .

you take him down outside , you understand ?
outside when you inject him .
do not talk to him .

i got it .
let' s rock and roll .

alright .
here we go .
you look good .
we tried .
the best as you can .
beautiful .
ready ?
one , two , three !
dean !
listen , macnab , he' s not going anywhere .
we wait .
sullivan , i just got made .
big time .
what you mean ' made ' ?
how can he make you , you' re on the street !
he' s right .
he' s anxious and scooping this place out like a pro .
he' s just made us too .
we' re not sure .
fuck !
damn it !
what we' re gonna have to do is ugly .
macnab , you' re a go .
compromised authority .
sorry pal , that seat is taken .
i' m afraid not .
wilson can' t make it , ever again .
look buddy , you got the wrong table .
this don' t have to be messy .
i just got a few questions for you .
sorry , left handed .
you see ?
now it' s gonna get messy .
get out of the way .
hello ?
how are you doing ?
he' s a runner , lietch .
you' re out of position .
get in position .
get out of the way !
back it up .
we need to extract macnab .
are you ok , man ?
police officer !
let me see your hands !
get your hands in the air and get on your knees !
now !
hands behind your head and get on the ground .
kissing the pavement now .
alright , down on the ground .
take it easy .
dean !
move !
what' s with you , idiot ?
you stupid man !
sullivan , we got him .
turn him over .
let' s go .
lift .
apparently , dean assaulted another man outside ... before been picked up by an ambulance .
we' re calling hospitals .
this doesn' t make sense .
you don' t use a hypogun as a weapon .
look , i like dean too .
he' s a war hero .
he certainly got medals to prove it .
but did you see that guy' s face ?
so what ?
he just snapped , is that it ?
just went nuts ?
you say like the possibility has never occurred to you .
what is this ?
who are you guys ?
i' m one of the guys washington has sent you to whack .
but we didn' t like that idea very much .
peterson , don' t talk to him .
your instincts are right .
you should be scared .
will you shut up ?
where is he ?
where' s scott ?
where is he ?
who the hell is scott ?
where does he think he is ?
what did you say to him ?
who' s in charge here ?
detective knight .
can i help you ?
agent junod .
fbl .
you had a suspect here .
where he' s been booked ?
slow down .
this is my crime scene , alright ?
my town , my suspect .
i' m sorry , my fault .
you' re under the impression i' m asking .
we' re investigating the theft of a prohibited narcotic ... from a government facility .
our drugs , our facility , our suspect .
no , you' re gonna have to do better than that .
if i get the right phone call from the right person ... then we can talk .
i want the other one too .
the runner .
he' s at a hospital , and he hasn' t been charged with anything .
you sure he' s at a hospital ?
witnesses saw him being picked up by an ambulance .
so yes , i' m sure .
amy , why are you messing with the bureau ?
because they are here .
whys is the bureau here ?
you shouldn' t have brought a body here .
how much time do we have ?
when did you inject him ?
about thirty minutes ago .
he' s pretty beat up .
he weights what ?
180 , 190 ?
i' d say synapse failure and death in six hours .
let' s get him inside .
and then he pulled down on me .
i know .
he' s the wrong guy we' re asking .
no , i don' t know what that is .
what is that ?
what did you do to him ?
you injected him ?
with what ?
i got news for you , you cocky little prick .
you fucked with the wrong guy , because when you fuck with him ... you fuck with me .
i' m gonna get what i need from you , even cut you open to find it .
still haven' t got that phone call .
i weighed you one better .
in writing .
alright .
every ' i ' dotted , every ' t ' crossed .
i guess he' s all yours then .
you' il have him as soon as he' s out of processing .
i want him now , detective .
that' s a whole other set of orders .
if you' ve gotten here a little quicker ...
the other from the diner , dean cage , i checked him out .
the guy is a three charlie .
jesus !
pentagon' s training spook ...
black ups , panama , lraq .
real bad ass .
this guy has torn the world and left a wake of bodies behind .
so what' s going on now ?
he' s a civilian now .
discharged right after his last job .
a little wet job in bosnia .
complete failure .
cage is the only member of his team that came back .
the guy snapped .
was exonerated .
so who is he working for ?
who cares ?
we know where they are .
i say we move it on the hospital .
and if the package ain' t there ?
we stick to the plan .
this is the man who killed your husband and children .
would you like to know where you can find him ?
hold up .
what are you doing with my suspect ?
stand down , detective .
this is no longer your concern .
what do you think ?
you think you can walk in here ... flash your badge and i' m supposed to give you a hand job , is that it ?
well , fuck you !
and fuck hoover too , i wanna talk to that man .
you ain' t talking to no one .
you' re annoying ... you' re a mutt running around , sniffing other dogs ' butts .
go away .
you' re out of your league .
these guys ain' t fbl .
what ?
you' re talking ?
what did you say ?
you have the balls to open your mouth ?
i' il talk to you .
i' il tell you whatever ...
fuck !
it' s alright .
it' s just the shoulder .
somebody get me an ambulance .
dean , can you hear me ?
can you hear me ?
can you hear me ?
we' ve got someone that wants to talk to you .
someone you trust .
your best friend .
alright , shit , it' s me man .
it' s me .
fuck ...
scott ?
they need to know what wilson told you about the shipment .
it' s not a big deal .
they just need to know ...
did he tell you where they were shipping it out from ?
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
did wilson tell you where they were picking up the ex ?
i don' t understand .
if you don' t tell them ... what wilson told you , they' re going to kill me .
scott ... you' re already dead .
i' m right here .
you can see me , i' m talking to you .
what did wilson tell you ?
what did he tell you about the shipment ?
what do you know about the goddamn shipment , dean ?
dean cage , united states army ... 1 9 0 4 0 5 2 4 3 .
dean cage , u. s. army ...
1 9 0 4 0 5 ...
son of a bitch .
what the fuck is going on here ?
what is this ?
we told him you' re his best friend .
his best friend is dead .
now he thinks we killed him .
hold on .
give me a sec .
how are you feeling ?
does it hurt ?
fuck you !
where did you get that ?
you don' t share with us , we don' t share with you .
you' re not fbl , who the hell are you ?
cla .
spooks working domestic .
now that' s illegal .
we' re on the same side .
no .
somebody injected this shit into my friend .
i' m on his side .
your friend ?
my friend , my family .
you' re fucking with my family .
what is this shit ?
it' s called ex , as in " experimental " .
what does it do ?
if i inject you with this ... can i make you shoot somebody at the police station ?
yes .
you can control the subject with a simple suggestion .
and it' s fatal .
total synapse failure from 6 to 8 hours of injection .
is there an antidote ?
we don' t have it .
who does ?
alright !
sullivan has the antigen .
who' s sullivan ?
he' s formal agency .
he used the ex for hostile interrogations .
he was impressed .
he decided he can make more by selling it .
he went after the whole batch and he got it .
where can i find him ?
where ?
i don' t know .
let him go .
what did he say ?
let him go .
cut him down .
cut him down or i' il kill every one of you motherfuckers .
cut who down , dean ?
don' t say another word to him .
is he talking about his buddy ?
you said his buddy was dead .
you have to understand something here .
this is the most powerful hallucinogen the world' s ever seen .
his susceptibility to suggestion is almost total ... but his mind will still take him places .
i don' t understand .
something was said to him before you brought him to me .
it' s total reality , but in his mind ...
i' m gonna kill every one of you .
future tense , past tense ...
ok .
you mentioned scott .
now scott is dead .
still he says ...
cut him down .
he' s remembering something now .
this is a memory .
he' s reliving a memory .
what is it a memory of ?
dean cage , u. s. army .
i say he was captured , a man named scott .
he was out in the field when he was captured .
something was said to him before you brought him to me .
you didn' t bring me a clean subject .
peterson .
what exactly did you say to him before you brought him here ?
i told him we were the guys washington has sent him to whack .
great .
because that has triggered something ... and now he thinks we' re about to kill his friend scott .
you said he' s already dead .
not anymore .
he' s not in his mind .
why couldn' t you keep your mouth shut like i asked you to ?
let me raise his heart rate a little bit ... just give it a little bump .
these floors are completely sound proof .
doesn' t matter how loud it gets .
whatever .
just get me what i want .
i' il get you what you want .
i don' t wanna do this the hard way .
we got more on that ambulance .
what ?
he used his strobe box to change the traffic lights to catonsville .
where did it go ?
we lost it when it got off the belt , but we got its id .
st. nevis hospital .
it' s a private facility .
psychiatric .
psychiatric ?
dean ...
cut him down .
listen , i wanna get this straight .
cut him down . cut him down .
you want us to let scott go , is that it ?
cut him down .
we' il cut him down .
cut scott down .
he doesn' t have to die again .
just tell us what we wanna know .
is it safe to move the ex ?
i don' t know .
i told you i don' t know anything about any ex .
do the feds know where we' re moving the ex ?
don' t make me kill him .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
don' t know what i' m talking about ?
are you sure ?
fuck it , i don' t know .
you don' t know ?
have it your way .
kill him .
kill him .
go kill scott .
cut his fucking throat .
we' re gonna make this prick watch .
mr. sullivan ?
i' m sorry to disturb you , but we got a situation down here .
mr. sullivan ?
we got a couple of cops wanting to get in .
wanna tell me what i should do ?
are you coming down or what ?
give me a couple of minutes .
i' m gonna have to let them in .
here we go .
detective knight .
my partner , detective miller .
my supervisor will be right down .
we didn' t ask to see a supervisor .
make it hurt .
fuck you .
this is all your fault .
kill him .
kill scott .
you fucked up .
sullivan ...
we have a problem .
whatever it is , it can wait .
open it .
hi , i' m the hospital administrator .
how can i help you ?
clear .
clear .
are you quite sure it was one of our vehicles , right ?
that' s a little strange .
i didn' t hear anything about accidents tonight .
would they concern you with such information ?
absolutely .
i' m very hands on here .
can we see that ambulance ?
sure , if you think it' s important .
i do .
shit !
did i do that ?
i don' t see any signs of any accidents .
where' s the other ambulance ?
the other one ?
it' s been on the shop for over a week now .
i' ve got a better idea .
the whole place is on fire .
the whole place is on fiire .
the drug .
the drug .
right .
alright .
let' s try this .
you' re on fire .
you' re on fiire .
we' ii put that fiire out for you .
there' s lots of water down here .
come on down .
we' il put it out for you .
what the fuck ...
goddamn it !
you' re free !
you' re free !
what the hell is he doing ?
he thinks the whole place is on fire .
there' s one in there .
he' s saving the patients .
have you seen my pony ?
he' s white .
if any comes to mind , anything at all .
sure .
thanks for your time .
put your hands over your head and surrender your weapon .
you won' t be harmed .
place your weapon on the ground and put your hands over your head .
put your weapon on the ground and your hands over your head .
amy ?
don' t fire .
do not fire .
don' t fire !
officer needs assistance .
hold your fire !
hold your fire !
forget about him , miller .
you' re not gonna catch dean .
not dean .
he' s killing people , amy .
he' s killing people .
dean cage just escaped from st. nevis .
he shot a guard .
and bcp is all over the place up there .
tell them to get that goddamn detective knight out of there ... and tell her to go after cage .
he drops down .
we' re waiting for him .
he plugs the guard , then he runs , jumps ...
and you saw the rest .
he' s dying , ok ?
and we' re the only ones with the antidote .
and if they do find the body ... it' s gonna be three weeks from now in some goddamn ditch .
what a difference does it make ?
you didn' t get a word out of him .
we tried .
you find him , and you find before anybody else does ... and you get me an answer !
i should' ve get paid in advance .
you' re on fiire .
kill him .
what happened to dean over there , in bosnia ?
what the hell happened ?
scott died .
it' s all i know .
he won' t talk about it .
what the hell is this ?
where are you going ?
we' re supposed to focus on the runner and leave this guys alone .
specially you , knight .
me ?
no , this is bullshit .
i' m not backing off , i want answers .
go , i got this .
amy !
just hold on .
great .
that' s great .
i' m trying to help you .
i' m sorry .
i don' t know what' s happening .
somebody does .
and if we' re getting orders , we' re getting them for a reason .
that' s bullshit !
i lost scott to bullshit like that .
and i' m not gonna lose dean too .
you already lost him .
he snapped .
sorry , but you gotta deal with the fact that you lost both over there .
the dean you were in love with is gone .
at least that' s not him out there , right ?
you' re on fiire .
you' re alright , man ?
look , my legs are burnt .
it looks like your legs are fine .
jack , the man can be crazy .
i just escaped from this asylum .
the people tried to kill me .
fucking crazy , man !
i don' t even know if this is real .
i want you to listen to me , alright ?
you' re on a drug , alright ?
you paid for this drug .
you paid to have a good time .
disorientation .
jack , he' s got a gun .
look at this .
you don' t have to worry about this .
let' s get out of here !
no man , it' s ok .
you might need it .
there are strange things going on around here .
some really strange things .
dean cage , his iast job was two year ago .
he' s been exonerated and been dismissed ever since .
guess what ?
our boy is ex special forces .
and the feds are using the locals .
probably told them he robbed a liquor store .
police just got a call about a guy leaping on a fuel truck ... while it was moving .
farm market road 2920 .
they injected him with something , that hypodermic gun .
we' re at the bottom of the food chain .
they' re not gonna tell us anything , are they ?
he' s out there all alone .
there he is .
holy fucking shit .
it' s a fuel truck .
i' m not gonna hit the truck .
you' re gonna knock out a shot at 60 miles per hour ?
where the fuck did he go ?
eye witness said the truck was headed north ... on the 2920 towards the baltimore bridge .
the suspect might be our runner .
fucking guy .
i' il get to your shot .
hell yeah .
how' s kennedy ?
she' s shot , she' s pissed .
what do we got on this truck ?
one body .
it wasn' t cage .
but i can deal one better .
i checked on your ankle biter , detective knight .
she had a brother in cage' s special jobs unit .
k. i. a.
so she knows him .
are they fucking ?
they don' t have that on these files .
of course not .
that would be useful .
alright , how' s this ?
she' s got a mortgage payment .
a house .
the place is 5 miles away from that tank truck .
see ?
that' s good .
amy ?
there' s no reason to believe this exchange can' t happen .
there' s every reason , because we didn' t get an answer .
i asked you very expressly to find him ...
i did not ask you to kill him .
this is over .
we' re leaving .
this exchange is not gonna happen .
we' re out of here .
i' m calling this off .
dean .
i think i' m gonna do it .
i' il ask your sister to marry me .
come on scott , i need your blessings on this .
you' re my best friend .
who else would i want her to be with ?
look at this .
you know what i think ?
that we' ve been searching the unluckiest man alive .
i don' t get it .
i think our friend cage was at that coffee shop ... waiting to meet up with his lady friend , detective amy knight .
and that boy bastard sat on the wrong booth .
so sullivan thinks he' s wilson' s contacts .
sullivan thinks he' s me .
so he' s useless .
no , he ain' t useless ... as long as sullivan thinks he' s me .
she' s calling her own place .
he was here .
dean ?
time to come out .
you can stop running , man .
nobody is gonna hurt you .
it' s alright .
easy .
easy , man .
wait a minute , dean .
put the knife down .
he stops talking or you' re dead .
down .
down , down .
hands on your head .
your turn .
alright .
be cool .
down .
i' m down .
cross .
cross , cross .
who the hell are you guys ?
d. a. fbl .
do you know you' re moon lighting ?
we' re cla .
cla ?
yeah , i' il buy that .
you' re some creepy fucks .
why are you trying to kill me ?
we' re not trying to kill you .
so i guess it' s just my unlucky day .
you have no idea .
those men that are trying to kill you were our targets .
we' re on the same side , dean .
you and i. you understand ?
i don' t work for you guys anymore .
i was discharged .
you fired me .
that doesn' t matter now .
listen , you' re safe .
you' re safe .
sit down .
you need to sit down .
go ahead .
that' s right .
go ahead .
go ahead .
you believe in me , don' t you ?
that you' re safe .
that' s right .
it' s alright , dean .
don' t even think about it .
drop the gun !
drop it !
cross .
cross !
amy ?
they injected you with a drug , dean .
it' s been screwing with your mind since the coffee shop .
you' re not real .
we' re not the problem .
i want this man sullivan .
i want the antidote .
do you hear me , motherfucker ?
i want the antidote .
you got it .
i want it too .
but the only thing that' s gonna make sure the ex shows up ... it' s him .
what' s ex ?
why should i wanna go back there ?
' cause that' s your only chance .
if you don' t go back and convince them it' s safe to move that ex ... you won' t get your antidote and you will die .
i don' t understand .
why don' t you storm the hospital and arrest him ?
' cause the ex is not in the hospital .
we don' t know where it is .
but if we convince them that it' s safe ... the ex will be moved to that airfield along with your antidote .
if he shows up there he' s dead , and you know it .
he' s dead if he doesn' t .
that ex will fry his brain .
either way , i don' t care .
i got one priority ... and that' s contain that ex .
that' s it .
' cause if that stuff gets in the open ... every breathing human being becomes a potential assassin .
house wives , children ...
there ain' t no secret safe .
i' m sorry , this man is not a concern of mine .
maybe of yours , but you' re all his got .
i stopped doing drugs as a kid for a reason .
i was gonna ask you to marry me .
did you know that ?
i know .
there' s always tomorrow , and the day after that .
and the day after that , and the day after that .
i never told you what happened over there .
with scott .
he died , baby .
he' s gone , it' s all that' s important .
listen to me ...
i' il be right behind you , dean .
as soon as this man sullivan heads to the airport ...
i' il come in for you .
you better .
it' s gonna take months to set up a new meeting .
this wasn' t part of the agreement .
it wasn' t part of our agreement you two fuck up over and over .
sullivan , you weren' t there .
you don' t know .
we had no option .
give me a break .
he didn' t talk to anybody .
and dean cage is dead .
i think i escaped from here .
i think i' m a patient ... but i don' t remember being a patient .
i' m pretty sure i' m a patient .
you did the right thing .
i can use some help .
welcome back .
do you know who i am , dean ?
i' m your doctor .
your psychiatrist .
i' ve been treating you for the past 6 months .
i don' t remember .
i know .
your mind is not working like it used to .
before you left , we were making progress .
