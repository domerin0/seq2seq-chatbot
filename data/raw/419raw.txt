because i want you to know , it' s now out of my hands .
happy birthday .
will you help me ?
of course .

i remember one summer ... ... the iocal kids ... ... the kids ' family owned this mare .
she was ... ... black as a raven' s wing , completely wild .
remember ?
they called her beauty .
she was trained as a trotter , but she had never really been ridden .
anyway ....
the kids told claudia that she had to ride beauty ... ... that it was like an initiation , the kind of thing they all had to do .
anyway , one day , i remember ... ... about noon ... ... it was really , really hot .
we heard this scream .
we ran outside .
there was claudia .
claudia ... ... bareback on this wild horse .
the horse went completely crazy .
bucked , reared .
she hung on .
she just gritted her teeth , dug her heels in ... ... and she hung on .
and , by god , she rode that horse .
i guess that' s how i remember her really .
this silp of a giri on a wild black horse .
she was so beautiful .
she was so beautifui that she gleamed .
