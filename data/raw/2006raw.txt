johan became a multimillionaire in his old age .
an old danish aunt ... who had been a renowned opera singer ...
left him a fortune .
once he became financially independent , he left the university .
he bought his grandparents ' summer house .
a run down chalet in an isolated area near orsa .
johan and i haven' t had any contact with each other for many years .
our daughters are far away , even from me .
martha lives in a home , sinking in the isolation of her illness .
i visit her now and then , but she doesn' t recognize me .
and sarah ...
sarah married a successful lawyer ... and then moved to australia where they have very good jobs .
they don' t have any children .
me ?
i still practice my profession , but at the pace i choose .
family quarrels and divorces mostly .
i' ve been thinking i should visit johan .
one marianne carries out her plan
i' ve been thinking ...
i should visit johan .
and now i' m here .
he' s sitting there , at the porch .
and i' ve been standing here , watching him and ... waiting , at least ten minutes .
maybe i should have ignored this irrational impulse .
this trip .
in fact , i' m not an impulsive person at all .
but here i am ...
slowly return to my car ... or get close to him .
of course , i could stay here a while longer ... and let my confusion abate .
but not very long .
a minute more !
this minute is taking its time .
33 seconds ...
47 seconds ...
55 seconds ...
no !
did i wake you ?
it' s you , marianne .
hi !
no , don' t get up .
typical , you were spying on me .
that' s not true .
we haven' t seen each other in 30 years .
32 years !
we simply lost track of each other .
that' s natural .
people start together , then they separate and talk by phone ...
and finally silence .
so sad !  was that a reproach ?
no , we had nothing to say to each other .
then suddenly you call me and tell me you want to visit .
you didn' t sound very keen .
keen ?
i said no .
i still say no .
i don' t want this .
no .
but you don' t care .
i had to come .
why ?
i won' t tell you .
you' re laughing .
johan ...
i' ve driven 340 km .... and managed to find your hideout ... in the middle of the jungle .
now that i' ve seen and kissed you and we' ve spoken i can leave .
that won' t be enough .
really ?
at least you can stay over for dinner .
why ?
a week ago , i told mrs. nilsson ... that my ex wife was coming to visit .
i can' t tell her suddenly that there' il be no dinner .
she' il go crazy .
who' s mrs. nilsson ?
agda .
agda nilsson .
are you and her a couple ?
god forbid !
the two of you live all alone here in the midst of a dark forest ?
mrs. nilsson lives in the village .
she cleans and cooks and then goes home .
she' s religious and mean .
there' s no romance then .
to be honest , i fear the hag .
i fear that she might want to marry me .
anyway , stay for dinner .
she' s made up the guest room , so you have to stay and spend the night .
i suppose i better accept .
it' s so hard to get up from this chair .
no , don' t help me .
what' s wrong , johan ?
i' m trying to put my arms around you .
want to hug me ?
damn , johan !
old idiot !
and how old are you ?
i don' t know , and you ?
86 .
no , not you , me !
around 55 .
i' m 63 .
really ?
that many ?
and i' ve had my uterus and ovaries removed .
does that trouble you ?
yes , sometimes .
let' s sit on the bench .
it' s so beautiful !
when beauty is revealed ... in life , in creation ...
where is the source , the giver ?
beauty forever .
i didn' t know you knew some psalms .
my grandmother taught me .
and my grandfather rewarded me with little iron soldiers .
we can enjoy the view ,
hold hands ...
are we going to hold hands ?
didn' t we used to do it ?
yes , i believe so .
i haven' t done it since ...
i' ve stopped doing it .
you really have a beautiful view .
can you see the lake house from here ?
you can see the light reflected , behind the rocks .
i drove by the lake house coming here .
it looks inhabited .
you could say that .
henrik is there .
yes , henrik .
mi dear son .
the assistant professor .
are you on speaking terms ?
not exactly .
i got a brief letter declaring that he was planning on moving there .
he and his daughter karin have been there since late april .
you don' t have much contact then .
absolutely .
a cordial conversation if we run across each other .
fat boy henrik !
he must be ... 61 !
my god !
you can say that again !
and his daughter karin ?
karin is 19 .
her mother died of cancer two years ago .
anna ...
tell me .
anna and henrik were married for 20 years .
he couldn' t take her death .
he retired before his time .
i heard they were happy to get rid of him .
he felt mistreated there .
like you , at that age .
me ?
no ...
well , yes , i was a bit fed up with the academic standards silliness .
my honorary doctorate from the university of michigan ... finished all that .
we were talking about henrik .
he directs an orchestra called " uppsala chamber soloists " .
but he' il quit that also .
he must do something .
i think he' s writing a book .
what about the daughter ?
karin ?
karin also plays the cello .
she' il audition for the conservatory in the fall .
henrik is teaching her .
they sit in the house with their cellos every day .
you could say she' s beautiful .
like her mother .
yes .
so ... i know nothing about our daughters .
sarah is in australia .
australia ? !
yes , australia .
well , she managed to get far away .
i get letters and phone calls from her .
she' s fine .
a good law firm .
a good husband .
sarah' s happy with her life .
and poor martha ?
martha' s sinking further and further .
she didn' t recognize me .
she' s no longer aware , in our sense , of the world .
i understand ...
and you ?
i can' t complain .
though sometimes , i see myself in voluntary isolation ... and i think i' m in hell .
like i' m dead , but i don' t know about it .
but i' m fine .
i' ve plagiarized my past now that i have the page of answers .
doesn' t sound like fun .
that' s it , marianne .
it' s not .
and who the hell said that damnation would be fun ?
what does your " page of answers say " ?
want to know ?
i asked the question , didn' t i ?
it says my life was shit .
a stupid and totally senseless life .
is our marriage part of your hell ?
to be honest , yes .
i' m sorry to hear that .
a good relationship has two elements : a good friendship and an unshakeable eroticism " .
nobody can say that we weren' t good friends .
good friends .
of course .
you were unfaithful .
i ...
i was too .
it' s so sad .
but it was long ago .
it' s still painful .
not for me .
no , i suppose not .
dearest marianne .
that' s what you say .
yes , it' s what i say .
it' s nice to be here with you .
holding hands , watching the beautiful view .
without talking about painful things .
you' re holding my hand .
dinner !
mrs. nilsson will be furious if we' re late .
johan , i need to wash up and get my bag from the car .
this was a mistake !
two nearly a week has passed
are you karin ?
do you want to speak to your grandfather ?
your grandfather and mrs. nilsson went to the dentist .
i' m marianne .
i was your granddad s wife .
i' m visiting .
i know .
come on , sit down .
if you want , you can help me clean out these mushrooms .
here' s a knife .
if you want to talk , we' il talk .
if not , we can just be together .
you must know henrik , my dad .
can' t say i do .
i' ve just greeted him , but i don' t know him .
mom is dead .
i know .
she died two years ago .
your granddad told me .
dad retired and is spending his time with music now .
the cello , right ?
he' s writing about st john' s passion .
you also play the cello ?
i hope to get into the conservatory .
your father is the teacher and you are the student .
yes .
what' s wrong ?
do you know hindemith' s cello sonata , opus 25 ?
i don' t know anything about music .
dad wants me to play it for the audition .
it' s too hard !
and doesn' t he think so ?
how were you in the days before your period ?
a premenstrual monster .
i would go to sleep as an angel , and wake up as a demon .
my mind gets shattered .
and it' s very hard for me to get up .
dad is a morning person .
and i yawned .
we were working on the fourth movement .
lebhafte viertel ohne jeden audsdruck und stets pianissimo
you know ?
it looks difficult anyhow .
so i sat there with my shattered mind and i tried .
i begged him to let me off the hook , to no avail .
he made me play the same part at least twenty times !
i don' t give a damn about this " .
i said that it wasn' t a class , it was animal torture .
lebhaft , sehr markiert ... mit festen bogenstrichen .
i was so angry that i couldn' t .
he said i was doing it on purpose .
i was unfair .
dad is the most patient , sensitive and courteous teacher there is .
he said it had nothing to do with the teaching , but rather with willpower and discipline ... and that i was lazy .
that i was lazy !
then i got up and left the cello because i was trembling .
i said that it was enough for the day and that i was going out for a walk .
he turned pale .
i' d never seen him like that .
you' re not leaving " .
i put my boots on and headed for the door .
i didn' t hear him approach , but he grabbed me by the shoulders ...
you' re not leaving !
you' re not leaving !
i sat and cried .
never again , never again , ... never again " .
and kept crying until i felt empty .
then i thought of coming over to see granddad and begging him to help me ...
leave that lunatic .
it was too much for me .
now the old man can take care of his crazy son : send him to the farm , go to the police ... or kill him .
then i became aware that from now on , i know nothing .
i know nothing about my life , what i' il do or become .
then i realized that mom is dead , and i can' t ask her anything .
i was overcome with sorrow for myself and cried again .
you must think i' m a very nervous person , but i' m not .
do you think henrik is suicidal ?
if he' d kill himself ?
in an extreme situation like the one you' re describing ... could he hurt himself ?
you know , to be honest , i don' t know my father very well .
i only know that deep inside he' s ... good .
if not , mom never ...
mom loved him , you know ?
they loved each other .
and i suppose i was out of that love .
that' s what i think when i' m feeling sorry for myself and i get tired of my boyfriends .
why can' t i feel love like mom did ?
were you afraid your dad would kill himself after her death ?
i never gave his tragedy much thought .
but i tried to take care of mom , as much as he' d let me .
mom was never very talkative .
but on one of her last days ...
she was always drowsy from the morphine ...
you know i love you " .
you know i love you , karin " .
my mother never spoke that way .
dad once said as a joke , this was a long time ago ,
anna never says i love you , but her actions are always full of love " .
what if grandfather comes back ?
it' s ok , i' ve got another bottle .
were you really married to grandpa ?
is that so strange ?
it' s hard to imagine it .
what kind of person is he ?
good question .
did you love him ?
i' ve asked myself the same question all my life .
was he so difficult ?
we were married for 16 years .
then we got divorced .
he had met another woman , an idiot named paula .
i got married again to a boring glider pilot .
one day , he just flew away .
they never found him .
for some reason , johan and i got together several times .
then i found out he was servicing ... another lady , a real whore .
i was angry and hurt and finished with him .
i suddenly realized , that i was the most cheated on wife and lover in the world .
johan was remarkably and compulsively unfaithful .
you mean that my grand father ... was a real liar .
and he used to write poems .
a volume got published , but it wasn' t successful .
my grandfather used to write verses ?
yes , even love poems for me .
did you keep them ?
no .
but did you love him ?
i was terribly naive .
nowadays , i suppose it' s just not possible to be so , so childish ... and so know it all like i was .
i think i loved him .
utterly .
you never suspected ?
not for an instant .
what made you come here suddenly ?
i don' t know .
you still love him !
don' t you ?
if you had to be honest , marianne ...
i hear people say johan is this or that , not very kind things usually .
but i don' t know the johan they' re talking about .
i always thought he was a good man .
very , very good .
it was so easy to hurt him , he could never defend himself .
i believe that johan ... is a moving person .
he' s moving .
are you crying ?
yes , a little .
are you crying for granddad ?
i' m crying for johan and marianne .
i understand .
this is strange .
dear ...
what will you do ?
return to henrik .
is that intelligent ?
it has nothing to do with that .
i' il stay here a few more days .
let me know what happens .
i will .
three about anna
it can' t happen again .
never again .
never .
we must have a serious talk .
we both know how things are .
there' s nothing to sort out .
i' m glad it' s so simple !
i was scared to death .
i was scared to death .
do you understand ?
i' m very tired .
i' m going to sleep .
are you asleep ?
no .
once i had a similar situation with anna .
we weren' t married yet , but we lived together .
maybe i was a little drunk .
i said nasty things about ... the damned university , my colleagues , our work environment .
and then about my father , that old bastard .
anna didn' t say a word .
and that upset me even more .
i remember thinking ...
what' s on anna' s mind , while she' s sewing that skirt ?
what' s she thinking ?
maybe that henrik is unbearable " .
and then she said it .
when you' re like this ,
i start thinking that you' re not the man i planned to marry " .
then she went to the living room and started to pack .
i tried to stop her .
she didn' t move ... but a message got through from her body to mine .
it said " i' m leaving ...
i' m leaving you " .
nobody leaves me " .
nobody leaves me
nobody turns his back on me and leaves ... " .
it' s over " .
anna' s leaving and she won' t return " .
but then i heard her going around the kitchen .
she was making coffee .
but she didn' t say a word .
maybe she wanted to sober me up .
she didn' t say anything for the rest of the evening : just kept on sewing .
anna was the silent type anyway , she never spoke much .
but we didn' t need to speak ; we always knew ...
i begged her to forgive me .
i won' t do it again " .
it' s just what i want to say to you , but it sounds ridiculous .
anyone can say " i' m sorry " , but it' s meaningless .
so no further words were spoken that night .
it became a ... distant night .
i stayed awake listening to her breathing .
i watched her , a street light shone through the window .
i gazed at her for a long time and wondered if she really knew ... how much i loved her .
between anna and me it was a question of belonging , if you know what i mean .
an ownership that was ... a miracle .
i know it sounds fatuous .
there' s no better word .
i fell asleep as dawn approached , and when the alarm clock rang , we got up , had breakfast and chatted as usual .
i went to a class and anna went to the library .
this is an explanation : not an excuse .
i have no excuses .
if you leave me ...
i il be ruined , or some other word that doesn' t exist .
in due time , you' il have your freedom .
you' il go to the conservatory ...
with professional teachers and a different life .
it' il be different for me also .
these months with you have been " a state of grace " .
for me , that is , not for you .
it was kind of you to return so soon .
i don' t know what to say .
it' s all so complicated .
we don' t have to speak about that .
sometimes i feel a great punishment awaits me .
four
about a week later , henrik visits his father .
kierkegaard , s.
or a fragment of life
am i interrupting ?
oh , so it' s you .
it' s been a long time .
how are you ?
well , thank you , and you ?
at 60 there' s 6 things wrong with you , at 70 , 7 and so on .
of course , it depends on your priorities .
i heard about your ex wife' s unexpected visit .
typical marianne .
she' s always known i hate improvisation .
maybe i can see her .
she' s gathering strawberries .
i don' t know if you' il be here when she returns .
i don' t mean to disturb you .
thanks for being considerate .
what do you want ?
i need 890, 000 kroner .
an advance on my inheritance .
you need money again .
i know , i owe you 200, 000 .
that you haven' t even begun to pay back .
don' t worry , i' il pay it back .
i' m sure i' il never see that money again .
it' s funny to consider it a " loan " .
if humiliating me amuses you , let' s not forget ...
i' m not paying rent on the lake house .
we' ve been there for five months and you haven' t seen a cent .
but you were able to buy a new car .
it' s a loan .
the owner is away .
when he returns in october , i' il be without a car .
how' s the book going ?
well , thank you .
that' s a thorough answer .
i' ve been here ten minutes , letting you humiliate me .
if i didn' t need the money , i' d have left long ago .
you can leave now .
it' s not for me .
it' s for karin .
i see ...
marianne told me you two argued .
are you trying to make her stay ?
do you think she' il accept a bribe ?
i wonder how anna was able to stand you .
don' t bring anna into this .
don' t you dare mention anna with that mouth .
i like you more or dislike you less when you use that tone .
there' s a healthy dose of hate in your banalities .
there' s a cello i can buy karin ; an 1815 fagnola .
it' s an excellent instrument , almost like a guarneri .
karin has a special talent , she could become a great musician .
i took care of her instruction , but her talent calls for more .
like her cello .
her german cello is passable , but she' il audition for the conservatory .
are you sure it' s good ?
it wouldn' t be the first time they fool you .
it has an authenticity certificate
and the seller is decent .
is that why it' s so cheap ?
he' s old and sick and can' t take care of it any more .
he said it' s perfect for her .
how touching .
dad , where does all this hostility come from ?
speak for yourself .
when you were 18 or 19 i tried to approach you .
you had been very ill and your mother wanted us to talk .
i told you i knew i had been a bad father , but i wanted to make it better .
and you screamed .
bad father ? !
you never were a father !
then you said you could do without my help .
honest hate must be respected ; i respect it .
but i couldn' t care less if you hate me .
you hardly exist .
if it wasn' t for karin , who thank god is like her mother , you wouldn' t exist at all for me .
there' s no hostility here , i swear .
give me the name and number of the cello owner and i' il see .
here you are .
thank you .
what' s your answer ?
i' il let you know .
can i go ?
i' m leaving .
can i just say one thing ?
only if you must .
that tale of an argument fifty years ago in no excuse .
poor anna .
will you hit me now ?
flve
i hope i' m not interrupting .
no , i' ve just finished .
i practice in the mornings .
i' m replacing her .
i thought you played the cello .
i have an organ diploma .
in my time , it was smart to have one .
there were a lot of churches and few orchestras .
what were you playing ?
a bach sonata for a trio .
first movement .
it was beautiful .
this is a unique organ from 1728 .
nobody knows how it ended up here , in the middle of nothing .
a few weeks ago , karin and i played a concert here .
it was almost full .
will you be playing any more concerts ?
i don' t have the time .
karin has to prepare her audition and i have to finish my book .
yes , i' m writing a book about bach' s passion of st. john .
i met karin .
they say she' s talented .
she' s considered exceptional , and not only by her dad .
are you her teacher ?
that' s the way it' s turned out .
in the conservatory , she' il have the best european teachers .
won' t it be difficult to let her go ?
yes .
you could say that .
do you love her a lot ?
yes .
i' m sorry .
no , it' s all right .
karin is like anna .
she doesn' t look like her .
what' s wrong ?
whenever i mention anna , i cry .
that' s the way it is .
i can' t help it .
she' s been dead for two years and it still hurts just the same .
that' s the way it is .
life itself has become a ritual .
i don' t know , i can' t find words to describe it .
i' ve become a handicapped person .
just like that .
handicapped .
karin is everything that lends sense into my life .
and so ...
it wouldn' t have much sense without her .
i think a lot about death these days .
one day i' il walk through the forest to the river .
a foggy , windless autumn day .
absolute silence .
then i see someone by the gate .
coming towards me .
she' s wearing a denim skirt ...
a blue jacket ...
she' s barefoot and her hair is tied up in a long pony tail .
and she' s walking towards me .
anna is walking towards me , through the gate .
and then i realize i' m dead .
then something strange happens .
is it this easy ?
we spend life thinking about death and what comes after .
and then it' s so easy .
i can see a flickering light in the music .
like bach .
i think i understand .
come for dinner tonight .
we' re good cooks .
thanks , i like that .
i have to go now , we' ve got a class .
karin gets angry if i' m late .
see you soon .
wait , i don' t think i can go .
i understand .
the old man would get mad ... no .
why did you come here ?
i don' t know .
you' re a lawyer , right ?
can i sue him ?
why would you want to do that ?
he' s got a fortune and won' t die .
he' s probably mummified by his own evil .
i asked him for an advance on my inheritance , but he humiliated me .
i' d love to sue him .
not while he' s mentally competent .
he' s not ill in that sense .
no , he' s not ill .
are you here to ask for money for a poor abandoned wife ?
don' t get angry .
of course i ask myself .
you haven' t had contact for decades .
i' m not here to ask for money .
are you fucking ?
do you hate him so much to have to talk this way ?
forgive me for desecrating this place and ruining our chat .
i hate him in all possible dimensions of the word .
i hate him so much , i would like to see him die from a horrible illness .
i' d visit him every day , just to witness his torment .
maybe i' m just a pathetic soul .
theoretically .
i see surprise and displeasure in your eyes .
as a lawyer , you should be used to ... the stupidity and repulsiveness in the world .
goodbye , marianne .
it was nice of you to listen to me .
sometimes i think i' m insane .
i suffer all the time .
slx an offer
karin !
hi , granddad .
well ... this is my study .
i haven' t been here for years .
you and anna would come sometimes , when you were living at the lake house .
you used to smoke then .
yes , you' re right .
i stopped when i read freud' s biography .
33 operations for a mouth cancer .
and even then he couldn' t stop smoking .
bur are you all right ?
unless you consider aging an illness .
that' s a beautiful picture of mom .
i found it by chance .
i had it blown up ... and there it is .
i think of mom every day .
and dream of her at night .
i thought the pain would subside .
but that' s not happening .
but it doesn' t hurt like in the beginning , now it' s here .
like a part of me .
i wouldn' t want to be without her .
i can say i miss her , painfully .
we didn' t see each other very often , due to henrik and i.
anna tried and tried .
but henrik and i never managed ... well , you know .
you wanted to speak to me ?
yes , sit down .
last night , mrs. nilsson came personally to deliver a letter .
meaning that dad shouldn' t ...
that was all right .
he' s in uppsala with his orchestra .
i have here a letter that came a few days ago , and it involves you .
have you heard of ivan chablov ?
director in st. petersburg .
he toured here recently with the philharmonic .
fantastic !
i' ve known him since my years in leningrad .
this letter is from him .
johan , my dear friend and brother " .
sorry for writing in my poor english and german
but my excellent secretary has just had twins " .
it' s very important that i write you , my dear friend " .
on a free night , i went to a young musician' s concert " .
i must say i was surprised and happy " .
a young female cellist was playing ...
a zoltan kodaly solo piece .
and i was surprised by that young performer' s talent .
" her maturity , her skill and courage " .
well , i' il be !
the school gave me her name ... " " and told me her father was her teacher .
i got in touch with him , but he rejected me curtly ,
maybe arrogantly is a better word .
my dear johan , i know you' re ... " her grandfather .
and that' s the reason why i' m writing you .
the young lady' s technique is risky , somewhat lacking : " " which could result in a future catastrophe " .
i' m a guest professor at helsinki' s sibelius academy ,
one of the best in europe .
i have a good rapport with the president .
and we could , after the mandatory exam ,
offer our young cellist a quality education ..
that her talent obviously deserves .
let me know your answer as soon as possible .
my embrace , ivan .
so , karin , what do you say ?
maybe i should add ... that i' il take care of all your expenses as long as you need it .
i' ve made him a good offer .
more than he was asking for .
so if you want it , it' s yours .
assuming , of course , that you accept chablov' s kind offer .
i don' t know what to say .
it' s overwhelming .
i understand this letter puts you in an awkward situation .
i' il write him and tell him that you' re ... flattered .
but that your decision affects others .
others ?
your father , specifically .
i need to rest .
goodbye , karin .
thanks for the chat .
marianne used to say that i was a terrible character judge .
that i didn' t understand emotions .
your mother lived in this world ... to do the most unbearable chore .
darkness got even darker ... and light faded away when anna died .
it' s hard for henrik .
to live .
despite everything .
you' re like your mother .
and i' m fond of you , katja .
goodbye , karin .
goodbye , grandfather .
seven anna' s letter
to henrik from anna ?
i found it in a book .
may 18 .
anna ... wrote it one week before dying .
i' d like you to read it .
i can' t understand anna' s handwriting .
you' il have to read it to me .
i' il try .
here , have some whisky .
mom had found out a few days before ... that she didn' t have much time left .
she wrote the letter because henrik had a cold ... and wasn' t allowed to visit her .
the fact that you can' t visit me is , perhaps , a relief for both " .
we understand each other well .
you open the door .
i make an effort .
you make an effort " .
but i still see in your eyes how sick i am " .
this is the difficult part .
she writes about dad and me .
is that painful ?
yes .
when you were with her at the hospital , did you speak about what she had written ?
no , never .
what did she write ?
dear henrik , i have to tell you something of which we' ve never spoken " .
i' ve wanted to talk to you about karin " .
but it was never necessary because i was always there " .
then i got sick and i was there no longer " .
of course i was there , but you kept me apart " .
you and i love each other .
i was sure about our love " .
but no love is strong enough ... to stand a devastating effect like my illness " .
i see that you love karin , but that you also tie her to you " .
it' s good that you were her teacher , but there' s a limit " .
when i' m no longer there , the limit will be unclear " .
i know that karin loves you " .
but you mustn' t use her love .
you' il hurt her " .
that could be a permanent wound " .
that' s why i ask you to let her go " .
you shouldn' t take advantage of her kinship " .
don' t take advantage of her because you' re her self proclaimed teacher .
dearest henrik " .
you' re so sensitive , so considerate , so kind " .
i know it , without a doubt , after so many years together " .
but you must be careful not to burden karin ... with the orphaned love that will remain when i' m no longer there " .
there' s more , but i don' t want to read any more .
i can' t .
it hurts so much !
i can hear my mother' s voice !
karin ...
why did you reach out to me ?
you' re very involved .
you could say that .
and you know about granddad s plans .
he told me .
i don' t expect advise , i need to hear my voice aloud .
i believe things will clear up this way .
go ahead , speak .
mom saw .
yes , i think so .
and everything she warned about has happened .
i can' t accept grandfather' s offer .
why not ?
if i leave henrik , he' il die !
if i leave him , he' il die ...
i' m sure about it , marianne ...
he doesn' t even have his orchestra anymore !
he can go on with his music , but the county is reorganizing ... and dad will not be part of the administration : he' il resign .
i can' t leave him .
i' m so tired of him sometimes !
i know all the things i can do in the future .
but mom is dead , and henrik can' t manage his own life .
how do you think i' d feel with the guilt if something happened to him ?
my future and henrik' s are entwined for now .
at least you say " for now " .
only for consolation .
i want you to know that i don' t feel the same as you .
i know .
anna' s love ...
that letter is love .
isn' t it ?
i don' t know .
elght
back already ?
there wasn' t much to do in uppsala .
hi , dad .
hi , little katja .
what score is that ?
bach' s suites for cello !
you' re mad !
listen , anderberg suggested that you and i ... play a concert in november .
it' s very hard for me .
we' il play together .
what do you mean together ?
like a dialogue , facing each other .
you' il play the parts you can handle and i' il play the difficult ones .
especially the prelude .
it' il be great !
which parts can i play ?
the sarabandes , for example .
it takes a lifetime to tame them .
we have three months .
and my audition ?
it' s almost ready .
and students get permission to play concerts .
i' ve spoken to brtz .
it' il be good for the both of us , now that i don' t have the orchestra .
i won' t even be the first violin any longer .
dad !
you must be furious !
perhaps .
but now i' il have more time for you .
i can help you better .
yes , of course .
that doesn' t sound very encouraging .
hello , katja , darling .
i have a feeling an argument is coming .
what' s wrong , katja ?
i don' t know .
that is , i think i know , but i don' t know how to ...
i know you' ve talked to your grandfather .
and with the bitch , i mean marianne .
yes .
i see .
you did it beautifully .
i must decide .
i thought you had already done that .
no , you did it .
really ?
i mean , is that what you' ve been thinking ?
dad ...
i haven' t bothered to think .
i thought , " dad knows what' s best for me " .
perhaps you' ve already made up your mind , haven' t you ?
will you accept your grandfather' s offer ?
have you read this ?
i have .
you read the letter that mom wrote me ?
it speaks about me .
but it was for me !
and you read it .
just like that .
do you think that' s all right because it speaks about you ?
if you' re going to get so upset , it' s no use talking about it .
i' m sorry , i' m sorry .
i said i' m sorry , damn it !
why do you say you' re sorry ? !
shall we get to work ?
or is there something else ?
dad ...
it' il be painful .
for you or for me ?
it may sound stupid , but your tone frightens me .
i' ve made up my mind .
for the first time in my life it' s my decision .
but are you sad ?
yes , i' m sad .
if you had told me you had that letter from mom ...
if you had let me read it , maybe we could have ...
you never told me ...
you should have ...
well , that' s the way it is .
how ?
next week , i' m going to hamburg with emma .
she and i will be going to a school for young orchestra musicians .
claudio abbado will come in october and we' il go to munich .
it' s for young people from all over europe .
you can' t be older than 22 .
abbado will work with us for six weeks and we' il play four concerts .
emma recorded a video .
she sent it to the admission committee , as a joke ...
we played brahms .
emma and i got a letter ... which says the school accepts us .
that we' re welcome .
and that ...
that' s exactly what i want to do .
and it' s exactly what i' ve decided to do .
and the conservatory ?
how long is the hamburg course ?
two years .
then there' s a paid internship in an austrian or german orchestra
three years .
how will you pay for it ?
i have my inheritance .
you' ve been thinking a lot .
i told emma it was useless .
that you had already decided .
god ...
oh god ...
but dad , i don' t want to ...
i don' t consider myself a soloist .
i want to play in an orchestra , be part of a team effort .
not sit down in a stage , alone and exposed .
i don' t want strangers to say that i' m not good enough .
i want to decide my own future .
i want a simple life
i want to be ... home .
to live a normal life .
not a poor substitute for mom ... who gets your praise for something i' m not .
it has to end .
and now it' s ended .
at least , give it the perfect ending .
what are you talking about ?
wouldn' t you like to play the fifth sarabande ?
right now ?
yes , please .
nlne cruclal moment
he' s here .
thank you .
can i ask who it was ?
from the hospital .
henrik tried to commit suicide .
with pills .
then he cut his arms and neck with a knife .
he' s in intensive care .
call this number and ask for nurse ingegerd .
god .
they found him at the last moment .
a certain mrs. berg was walking by the house ...
and saw a naked person on the floor .
god .
the door was unlocked .
she tried to wake him up , but he was unconscious .
and bleeding .
the ambulance took 20 minutes .
my god .
i should call karin , but she' s on her way to hamburg .
henrik systematically fails at everything .
he can' t even kill himself .
say something , for god' s sake .
you want me to answer that ?
whatever .
say something spontaneous for once .
you can' t .
sometimes you act like a forgotten character ... in some stupid old movie .
you' re not real .
you don' t say .
right now ... no , let' s leave it .
no , go on .
where did you gather all this disdain ?
i didn' t remember you like this .
disdain ?
yes !
i don' t know .
any disdain i have is for myself .
i don' t know .
i never thought of it this way .
and the poor boy ?
boy ?
ah , henrik .
maybe he realized he was a lot like me .
i was never like him .
so ridiculous all the time .
obese and submissive .
he surrounded me with a sticky love .
i admit i ignored that love .
he was as dedicated as a dog .
i wanted to kick him , metaphorically .
what will happen now ?
how will this affect karin ?
she' il blame herself .
she should have thought about it .
do you think she' il return home ?
i don' t know .
you' il speak to her , won' t you ?
if we find her .
i' il hire you as my agent .
how much do you charge ?
money is no problem .
as long as you put her guilt in a safe .
what if she comes ?
she loves that bastard .
that would be disastrous !
yes , i believe so .
what can i say ?
i was so close to anna .
it was terrible when she left .
for me also .
even though i was on the outskirts of the catastrophe .
it' s incomprehensible that henrik ... had the privilege of loving anna .
and that she loved him .
you' re smiling ironically .
no .
i' m not smiling .
i' m trying not to cry .
there' s no reason for you to cry .
there is , but i won' t give any explanations .
ten the hour before the dawn
marianne .
marianne !
sorry to wake you up .
it' s all right .
i' il go back to sleep .
what' s wrong ?
johan ?
i don' t know .
i think it' s anguish .
anguish ?
what do you mean ?
i see !
you' re sad !
i' m not sad ...
it' s worse .
it' s an anguish from hell .
it' s bigger than me .
it' s trying to make way through every orifice in my body ; my eyes , my ass .
it' s like a huge mental diarrhea !
i' m too small for this anxiety .
are you afraid of death , johan ?
more than anything , i' d like to scream .
what can you do with a baby that won' t be comforted ?
come , lay by my side .
there' s no room .
we' ve slept in smaller beds .
we won' t be able to sleep .
it doesn' t matter .
not in the last days of our lives .
i have to take off my shirt .
it' s damp from my diarrhea .
come on .
you take it off too .
yes
come on , johan .
come here .
there ... lie down .
good night , marianne .
good night .
could you explain why you turned up here ?
i thought you were calling me .
i never called anyone .
i had it in my head .
how strange .
i understand your not understanding .
how long will you stay ?
i have a case on the 27th .
november ?
october .
good night , again .
good night .
perhaps you' re asking yourself how it came out .
i stayed with johan until early october .
our time together was relaxingly pleasant .
we almost never talked about sensitive subjects .
the last night we celebrated .
nothing out of this world , but good enough .
we promised to remain in touch .
i think we even fantasized about a trip to florence ... the next spring .
that trip never happened , of course .
but we used to speak on the phone on sundays .
then , one day mrs. nilsson answered the phone .
she said that johan couldn' t take any calls , but that he would write .
i asked if he was all right ; she said yes , as far as she could tell .
that he was just tired and that he would be writing .
i never got a letter , of course .
i wrote him , but never got an answer .
that' s all i know .
things are always all right with me .
in order .
everything in its place .
maybe i' m a bit lonely , but i don' t know .
sometimes ...
i think of anna .
i wonder how she managed her life .
how she spoke ...
how she moved ...
her look ...
that almost surreal smile .
anna' s feelings .
anna' s love .
well ...
something happened to me that perhaps is related to this .
when i came back , i visited my daughter martha at the sanatorium .
but i thought about the enigma ... that for the first time in our lives ...
i realized ...
i felt ... that i was touching my daughter .
my baby .
