take a look at a castle , any castle .
now break down the key elements that make it a castle .
they haven' t changed in a thousand years .
one , location .
a site on high ground that commands the territory ... as far as the eye can see .
two , protection : big walls .
walls strong enough to withstand a frontal attack .
three , a garrison .
men who are trained and willing to kill .
four , a flag .
you' re soldiers and that' s our flag .
nobody takes our flag .
one step forward .
forward !
and you raise that flag so it flies high where everyone can see it .
now you' ve got yourself a castle .
the only difference between this castle and all the rest , is that they were built to keep people out .
this castle is built to keep people in .
ohh !
come on .
give me the ball .
give me the ball , man .
come on .
give me the fucking ball .
fuck you !
sir ?
sir ?
a movement order just came in .
give it to captain peretz .
i' il take that , sheila .
it' s a category " a " transfer .
let me see it .
fall out !
fall out !
fall out !
play ball , man .
come on .
1700 hours ?
n no , no , we' re prepared .
well , it' s just really fast .
okay .
mm hmm .
all right .
you' re sure you' re positive about this .
okay .
thank you .
sir ?
sir ?
it' s the real deal .
he is coming in at 1700 hours .
seventeen hundred hours today ?
that' s what they said , sir .
i don' t understand .
the trial began today .
apparently , he pled guilty and got ten years .
they' re expediting his transfer as a courtesy .
oh , as a courtesy ?
they should be naming a base after the man .
not sending him here .
my god , eugene irwin .
well , we have verdict .
we have a sentence .
we have a prisoner .
we do our job ... whether we like it or not .
puts us on our toes , though , doesn' t it ?
escort detail report to gate 18 prisoner .
escort detail meet the prisoner on gate " a " .
i give him a week .
' till what ?
' till he " scrags " himself .
the court martial didn' t put him over the edge ,
i guarantee you the shithouse will .
a week ?
six bundles .
six ?
let' s make it ten .
all right .
make it ten then .
ah , there we go .
ten bundles , mr. dellwo .
very specific man .
anybody else ?
you have absolutely no idea what you' re talking about .
come on .
we' il make it like the final four .
ten bundles a square .
who' s in ?
i' m not going to bet on whether or not a man' s going to kill himself .
that' s some creepy shit , pilot .
besides , look at him .
one week ?
he' s tougher than that .
how much tougher , eight , ten , what ?
eight .
anyone else ?
you' re an ice cold motherfucker , yates .
hey , i' m not betting ... he' s going to off himself , i' m just playing the books .
what about you , cutbush ?
i know you' re in .
put me in for a week and a half .
a week and a half ?
wallace ?
go ahead .
i have the transfer " a " to the p. r. u. now .
copy that .
p. r. u. one wallet .
leather .
family photos ?
my daughter .
grandson .
would you like to keep these ?
um , that' s an authorized item .
i' d appreciate that .
one set of keys .
glasses .
i' m going to need your ring .
thank you .
oh .
actually , you can keep that .
academy rings are authorized .
three stars , two sets .
looks like that' s everything .
so , uh ...
sir ?
prisoner irwin is outside .
five minutes .
five minutes .
you can put that down if you want .
you talking to me ?
yes .
i know what you' re thinking .
do i salute you , or do you salute me ?
well , the answer is neither .
my men salute me , of course , and each other according to rank .
but there is no saluting by the general prison population .
well , first things first .
are you hungry ?
no .
are you sure ?
mondays are our salisbury steak night .
always a cause for celebration .
indeed .
indeed .
may i offer you some lemonade ?
thank you .
just be a minute , sir .
prisoner aguilar ...
if you' il step over here , i' il give you ... a basic layout of the facility .
the building we' re in now is the administration building .
that building there houses the tiers .
that' s where you and the other inmates will live .
the building next to it is the laundry , where i' ve had you assigned .
oh , that is the old blockhouse wall .
it' s all that' s left of the original prison from the 1870s .
i could' ve removed it , but i thought it was important to keep a sense of history , so i asked the men to rebuild it .
they seem to enjoy it .
it' s a matter of some pride now .
sir ?
yes ?
please , on the table there .
please .
come on .
let' s go .
i personally meet with every new inmate here at the prison .
usually downstairs .
and i ask them a question .
what do you expect from your time here at the castle ?
nothing .
just to do my time and go home .
perfect .
that is the perfect answer .
and now i have what may seem under the circumstances , a bizarre request .
i have a collection of most of the seminal books on warfare , including the burden of command .
and i was wondering if you would do me the honour of signing it ?
certainly .
thank you .
captain peretz .
yes , sir ?
two minutes .
that' s impressive .
yeah .
it' s a great collection , isn' t it ?
yeah , sure .
that' s a minie ball from shiloh , used in battle .
grant lost 13, 000 men at shiloh .
suppose this got one of' em ?
never know .
do you ?
i mean , do you collect anything ?
no .
just a few coins from some of the countries i' ve travelled to .
my father didn' t care for military collections .
i guess it stuck with me .
any man with a collection like this is a man who' s never set foot on a battlefield .
to him , a minie ball from shiloh is just an artefact .
and to a combat vet , it' s a hunk of metal ... that caused some poor bastard a world of pain .
i must have misshelved it ... your book .
we' il do it another time .
no , please , please .
allow me .
sir , lights out in five .
do i hold the lock ?
no .
no .
we are ...
we' re through here .
prisoner aguilar , what are you doing ?
you do not salute this man .
this man has no rank .
saluting amongst prisoners is prohibited .
y yes , sir .
bu but i was saluting you .
take the prisoners to their cells , captain .
yes , sir .
thank you for your hospitality , colonel .
you' re welcome .
inmates , one step to the rear ...
ho !
shut the doors !
you' re gonna be in cell 345 .
you get to shower every other day .
okay , hold up .
you fuck !
i' m going to kill you !
shut up , beaupre .
do not cross the yellow line while in formation .
during the day you' re free to be in this area we' re walking in right now .
showers on both sides .
those stars don' t mean shit now , do they ?
you' re allowed one book in your cell , in addition to the bible .
go up here , then make a right .
i' ve got eight bundles on you , general !
let' s see ...
no , no , no .
you got to hold out for five weeks , then kill yourself !
three four five .
crash 345 .
you all right , general ?
first call , 0600 .
what' d you do , man ?
what are you here for , man ?
close 345 .
how many did you kill ?
welcome to the castle , baby !
sir ?
sir ?
prisoner irwin' s in his cell .
he' s really something , isn' t he ?
mmm .
would you like the end of day report , sir ?
is everyone where they' re supposed to be ?
yes , sir .
then skip it .
very good , colonel .
is there anything else ?
tomorrow , put out only one basketball .
what you doing ?
you just hit a brick wall .
nigger , why you doin ' that shit ?
come on , little brother .
get your hands off me !
come on , bitch !
three to one on the little man .
stab him !
come on , thumper .
kill ' im !
come on , bitch !
what are you doing ?
man , you don' t like it , doc , take a walk .
you' re fuckin ' sick , yates .
you see how easy it is to manipulate men ?
someone should write a paper on it .
hold .
come on !
come on , bitch !
end it .
sound the horn .
on the ground now !
all inmates remain on the ground in a prone position .
get the hell down now !
thumper , get down !
i didn' t mean it !
get down , thumper !
get down !
get down , thumper !
yes , sir .
all inmates remain on the ground in a prone position .
no !
i didn' t do anything !
thumper , get down !
' sound off
oh , shit !
watch where you' re going .
kiss my ass !
don' t worry about it .
we' il do it later .
damn nigger !
what ?
you heard me !
say it to my face , white bitch !
i' m gonna kick your white ass through the air !
shut the fuck up !
what the fuck you doing , beano ?
hey !
i said what the fuck are you doing ?
the mortar' s weak , beaupre .
don' t worry about it .
mind your own business .
cool out , man .
shut the fuck up , or i' il stick this in your neck .
they' il throw you back in the hole .
it' s all w weak .
don' t worry about the mortar .
m my daddy' s ...
my daddy' s a mason .
spit it out .
i don' t give a fuck if your dad built the pyramids .
whites work the wall , period .
get back on spic duty and bring me some rocks before i give you a slap .
they won' t set , beaupre .
what did i just tell you ?
what' d i just tell you ?
we' re only doing this ... to keep johnny fucking eyeballs off our back .
don' t make me tell you again .
back the fuck off !
beaupre !
knock it off .
what ?
big hero .
don' t worry about me going back to the hole .
how you doing ?
you probably don' t remember me , but i served under you in the gulf .
dr thomas bernard , 33rd medical unit .
that' s right .
actually , it' s lee bernard , but close enough .
you were arrested for hashish ... possession of hashish ... as i remember .
that' s right .
it was a small amount , as i recall .
you don' t get sent here for that .
no , no .
you don' t .
there' s more to it than that .
hey , thumper !
i was able to get you an aspirin .
thanks .
i got shot with a real bullet once , doc .
didn' t hurt this much .
that' s the upside of real bullets , they cut through the flesh , hit fewer nerve endings .
downside is they kill you .
of course , so do the rubber ones sometimes .
hell of a downside .
hey , doc , you think i might get one of them purple hearts ?
absolutely , thumper .
you take it easy .
i' il try to get you some more .
you know winter played us with that one basketball shit ?
come on , man .
general , sir .
don' t call me sir .
i' m not a general any more .
can we at least talk to you ?
about what ?
you still got friends in the pentagon , right ?
you could talk to them .
i' m a little hazy on the subject matter .
look , what happened here today happens all the time , sir .
let me get this straight .
you mean there' s violence ?
yeah .
in a prison packed with violent criminals .
that' s not what we' re saying .
no .
there' s been ...
how many this year , doc ?
um , 13 men down , 11 of them were critical injuries ...
stop your fucking whining .
listen to yourselves .
then he only gives us the most basic medical treatment .
completely substandard services .
substandard services ?
yes .
substandard services .
it' s fucked up shit , man .
i had a friend in hanoi who had to repair his own fractured tibia .
you cannot begin to compare what went on in a foreign pow camp 30 years ago ...
no , you can' t compare .
i' ve led real soldiers in more difficult situations than this .
but you' re not real soldiers any more , and neither am i.
there' ve been murders .
do you know what happens when you take a rubber bullet to the head ?
the lights go out .
twice in the last year there' ve been accidents ...
where men have been hit in the head and killed .
nothing can be proven .
we' re talking about expert marksmen shooting from minimal distances .
the guards just say the guy turned his head and boom .
it' s not a random thing .
you get on winter' s bad side , you' re done .
when you' re doing combat duty , after a while ,
life just becomes snapshots .
most of them horrible .
but not all of them .
three years ago in bosnia , i was driving a small unit through an ifor town .
and i saw something pretty interesting .
i saw an old man sitting on a bombed out porch , playing a game of dominos with what i presume is his grandson .
when i saw that i thought , you know , it' s my turn .
i didn' t retire after that , as i should have .
i took one last assignment .
it was a mistake .
so , gentlemen , i' m done .
i' m not fighting anyone or anything any more .
i' m doing my time here , i' m going home , and god willing ,
i' m going to sit on the porch and play a game of dominos ... with my grandson , who i' ve never met .
what' d i fucking tell you , doc ?
you call a three star general " man " ?
why don' t you call him " dude " ?
attention , inmates , the library will close early at 1700 hours .
the library will close early tonight at 1700 hours .
watch yourself , snitch .
hey , yates , everything all right ?
okay .
my boy say you got a nice ass .
i got a guy in 129 who' s way behind , telling me stories .
how late is he ?
three weeks .
why didn' t you tell me ?
i' m telling you now .
yates , no way that was a touchdown , baby .
that was a fucked up call .
keep that shit on the down low .
they' re all fucked up calls .
how you doing ?
22 to 20 .
army navy game .
class of ' 92 .
i met you once when i was a kid .
1981 .
it was a welcome back celebration at the white house for the pows .
my father was with you in hanoi .
what' s your name ?
yates .
yates ?
sam yates ?
that' s right .
good man .
nah , he wasn' t .
after 30 years , everyone' s a good man .
it' s the law .
mmm .
how is he ?
how' s your dad ?
he' s not too good .
he' s dead .
i' m sorry .
what happened ?
came home .
billingworth , irwin , jacobson ...
you' re late .
you have five minutes left on your visitor .
five minutes left .
rosalie ?
hi .
hi .
it' s good of you to come .
thank you .
was it hard getting here ?
um , i missed a turn .
it' s just good to see you .
how' s ben ?
good ?
fine .
uh huh .
school okay ?
grades ?
um , well he' s in first grade .
well , do you have a picture of him ?
no .
the one i have is two years old .
he must have changed a lot since ... since then .
and how are you , rosalie ?
um ...
look , dad ...
uh oh .
look , dad .
i just ...
i can' t do this .
i can' t do this small talk thing with you .
the whole drive over here , i was trying to think what ...
what am i going to say ?
what can we talk about beyond the weather ... and how' s ben , and i just went blank .
do i ...
do i intimidate you ?
intimidate me ?
i guess that' s the downside ... of having a " yes , sir " " no , sir " military father , but i tried not to ...
you weren' t a father at all .
god , i' m sorry .
i don' t want to whine .
i' m not here to be cruel .
you' re a great man .
and you' ve done so much for this country .
but ?
no .
no but .
no but .
just this isn' t the place .
well , it' s the only place i' ve got right now , rose .
why did you call me , dad ?
why ?
i don' t know you .
you don' t know me .
i mean , what did you think asking me here ?
that i' d come every sunday and maybe i' d bring ben ... and he would sit and colour while we talked ?
there was a time .
when i was about 20 ,
i had a whole list of things i was going to say to you .
those days are gone .
the visitation session is over .
please conclude your visits .
this isn' t enough time , man .
let' s go , folks .
let' s go .
i' m sorry you' re in this place .
and i wish you the best .
i wish you the best .
i guess you figured out what to say after all .
i guess i did .
be all right if i wrote ?
is that okay ?
there' s some things i' d like to tell you .
when i was in first grade , i got straight " a" s .
come on .
let' s go .
afternoon , sir .
don' t call me that .
i' m not ...
put your hand down .
permission to speak , sir .
what ?
i just wanted to say welcome to the castle , sir .
it' s good to have you aboard , sir .
aboard ?
you navy puke , son ?
no , no , sir .
i was in the corps .
what rank were you when you were arrested ?
i was a c c c ...
it was either colonel or corporal .
i' m guessing corporal .
yes , sir .
why are you here ?
what did you do ?
well , that' s just it .
i di didn' t do nothing .
it was a mistake .
oh .
okay .
medication call is in five minutes .
i h hurt someone real bad .
how long you been here ?
two years .
and how long do you have ?
how much longer ?
four years , eight months , eleven days .
and this mistake , you' ve just the one ?
just just one .
just one day in your life ?
ju ju ju ...
no .
take your time .
got plenty of that .
just five seconds , sir .
and you' re a marine for what , one or two years ?
and you' re a violent criminal for five seconds ?
yes , sir .
well , according to my calculations , that makes you mostly marine .
about 98 percent , i' d say .
yes , sir .
then why not act like one ?
stand tall .
this thing that you' re doing with your hand , grabbing your hair , what' s that ?
that was a salute .
a sa ...
oh , no .
i don' t think so .
you know where saluting comes from ?
no , sir .
it comes from medieval times .
two knights would approach each other on horseback .
they would raise their visors and show their faces .
it' s like they' re saying , " this is who i am .
i' m not the enemy and i' m not afraid .
a salute' s about respect , son .
respect for yourself , the service and the flag .
if you' re going to do this ...
sir , you wanted to see me ?
sir ?
come .
look at that .
oh , man .
no , no , no .
at the war college , his very name was spoken ... with a reverence .
as if the syilables themselves conveyed what it meant to be a soldier .
now here he is commanding an army of one ... the stuttering monkey .
can' t even watch .
i discussed the regulations on saluting with aguilar , did i not ?
yes , sir .
remind him again ... effectively .
put your hand down .
put it down .
you don' t have to do this .
prisoner irwin , what are you doing ?
he doesn' t have to do this .
look , just step back in the prison ...
son , i know a thing or two about the disciplining of soldiers .
prisoner aguilar , resume your punishment .
punishment is over .
aguilar , i' m warning you ...
men down !
men down !
you' re better than this .
okay , okay .
that' s enough .
all inmates remain on the ground in the prone position .
all inmates remain on the ground in the prone position .
stay down !
everybody stay down !
what is happening here ?
this prisoner was interfering with the corporal punishment of prisoner aguilar .
prisoner irwin , i understand your coming here must be a big adjustment for you .
to go from commanding thousands of troops in battle , having no war to fight and no one to follow you must not be easy .
however , i do ask that you learn how things are done around here ... and try to set an example for the other men .
saluting is prohibited .
aguilar was saluting .
he is being disciplined .
surely you understand that .
captain , take the prisoner back to his cell .
yes , sir .
sir ?
may the prisoner speak , sir ?
yes .
according to the manual of conduct , the corporal punishment for a prisoner begun on the day shift ... cannot exceed the following morning' s horn .
prisoner irwin , you are absolutely right .
thank you for bringing that to my attention .
captain .
captain .
yes , sir .
prisoner irwin , under no circumstances ... is an inmate allowed to make physical contact with an officer .
you have violated the u. s. m. c. f. manual of conduct .
and this violation requires discipline .
what' s going on ?
winter' s got him on rock and roll detail .
is he not going to make it ?
no way .
three two against .
come on , you guys .
those stones weigh 25 pounds apiece .
it' s gonna be 85 degrees by noon .
we have 2, 000 percent humidity .
the guy' s not going to make the day .
everyone paid up this week ?
yeah , we' re good .
put mine in , double or nothing against .
no way he' s gonna make it .
beaupre , 12 .
double or nothing , against .
hey , hey , hey .
who' s down for ten ?
at least take some water .
if you' re dehydrated , you' re gonna drop .
can he take it off , boss ?
captain ?
you can take off your shirt if you want .
hey !
what the fuck is that ?
electrical burn scars .
what do you mean ?
how long was he in there ?
six years .
could' ve got out in four .
they offered him a full release , but he stayed six .
he said he wouldn' t leave without his men .
come on , baby !
drop that rock !
come on , general .
you can do it .
come on , baby !
push that rock , soldier !
kind of tired , sir .
why don' t you call it quits ?
don' t listen to him , sir .
it' s not that hot .
why don' t you call it quits , sir ?
go , general !
come on , baby !
come on .
one more rock !
you got it , sir !
that' s it .
it' s over .
somebody pushed me .
that' s it .
he' s down .
he can' t go on like that .
it' s all over .
stay down .
look at me .
follow it .
it' s all done .
all over .
it' s all over .
yates , 36 packs you owe me .
how many ?
four .
what day is it ?
saturday .
he' s fine .
yeah !
go !
go !
go !
yes , sir .
the discipline order was horn to horn labour .
doesn' t matter where the stones are .
you have to continue .
what' s he supposed to do , captain ?
he just moved the whole goddamn pile .
well , he can move ' em back .
bets are still on .
seven two , against .
you' re a fuckin ' snake , man .
don' t bet if you don' t want to .
yates , four in favour .
four in favour , aguilar .
four in favour !
who' s down for ten ?
the horn .
they' re holding the horn .
winter' s holding the horn .
that ain' t right .
son of a bitch .
all right , everybody to the tiers for count !
let' s go !
move it !
inmates will move to tiers ... for face to badge count .
inmates will report to the tiers for face to badge count .
why would you kill yourself to help him with his wall ?
it' s not his wall .
it' s your wall .
prisoner irwin , let' s go .
the commandant would like to see you .
they clean you up okay ?
yes .
the cut above your eye , it' s not too serious i hope .
i' m okay .
well , i am sorry about this .
it' s the standard cooling off period after a punishment detail .
i hope you understand ...
i did this for the men .
the men ?
yes , to show them ...
to show them that you are no different than they are .
your new friend , aguilar , he took a claw hammer to his platoon leader .
he maimed him in a quote , unquote fit of rage .
whenever i am ... filled with doubt ... whenever sentiment creeps in ...
i just have to open an inmate' s file and see what he' s done .
i see what he' s capable of .
i see the worst in him .
and that makes my job easier .
it crystallizes my mission .
take him back to the tiers .
yes , sir .
hold on .
sergeant , taking him back to cell 345 .
very well , private .
general !
good night , guys .
your winnings .
my winnings ?
aguilar placed a bet for you .
four bundles at seven to two , two bundles at eleven to one .
that' s 36 bundles .
you know , you could get yourself thrown out of the hall of fame for betting on yourself .
corporal aguilar .
would you pass these out to the men ?
i don' t smoke .
thank you , sir .
so you' re the gambler .
nah , i don' t gamble .
i' m just the bookkeeper .
yeah ?
i hear you' re running a suicide pool on me .
that' s right .
any squares left ?
yeah , there' s one .
nine weeks .
how much to enter ?
no way , man .
knowing you , you' d off yourself just to win the bet .
oh ho , not me .
i bet on myself , it' s to win .
yeah , you don' t always win .
no .
clearly not .
you know , my father said you kept him alive in hanoi .
he said you kept all those guys alive .
nah .
when you' re tortured , the first thing they do is try to break down your sense of self .
and i broke in hanoi .
for weeks , the last thing in my mind was self preservation .
in fact , i prayed for death every night .
and the only thing that kept me from answering those prayers , were the voices of the men in the other rooms ... your father among them .
i don' t care what you' ve heard , yates .
they kept me alive .
not the other way around .
hey !
sir ?
you cost me my whole stash of smokes .
oh .
well , i' m sorry about that .
well , you win some , you lose some .
so what did you mean earlier about it being our wall ?
i mean , it' s winter' s wall .
that fuck just makes us work it to keep us occupied .
it' s like we' re a bunch of little kids or something .
in 1870 , there was nothing here .
the original prison was built by prisoners .
i want to show ...
i want to show you something i found the other day .
where ?
oh , here it is .
you see this ?
private a. j. beck , 1912 1923
now why do you suppose private beck ...
what do you think he was doing , building his own prison ?
how the fuck do i know ?
well , i don' t know either , but i can make a guess .
my guess is he wasn' t building a prison .
my guess is he was building something else .
they may have told him to build a prison , but , in his own mind , he was raising walls to protect himself .
my guess is he was building a castle .
that' s a castle ?
yeah , it could be .
could be .
if somebody rebuilt it .
how we supposed to do that , sir ?
how are you supposed to do that ?
i don' t know anything about walls .
why don' t you ask pri ...
ask aguilar .
his dad' s a mason .
niebolt !
good morning , sir .
what happened here ?
the prisoners , they knocked it down , sir .
why ?
irwin , he told them to .
thank you .
beau beaupre ?
what' s up , aguilar ?
th that' s not the right rock .
cutbush , you believe this kid ?
yeah , he seems to know his shit , you know ?
all right , aguilar .
i' il bite .
bring me the right rock .
o okay .
you need a rock with a flat edge , because because that one' s jagged .
th the jagged ones go in the middle .
the middle ?
all right .
bring me another one .
if i keep getting you the flat rocks , you' il never learn ...
i' il get you one more , okay , beaupre ?
mr. aguilar ?
it looks good .
thanks , chief .
morning , chief .
" molly be damned
smote jimmy the harp with a horrid little pistol and a lariat
she' s goin ' to the bottom she' s goin ' down the drain
said she wasn' t big enough to carry it
she said , " get behind the mule
" gotta get behind the mule " pu put that on the outside .
you gotta get behind the mule
in the morning and plough
you gotta get behind the mule
in the morning and plough
i' m impressed .
pretty handy with a trowel .
good work , you guys .
you know it , chief .
nice work .
thanks , chief .
what do you think ?
i think she' s beautiful .
that' s the word .
eighteen courses in one week .
aguilar ...
i' m proud of you .
you should be proud .
men did good , huh ?
they did .
now , listen .
be sure to leave a window , a portal .
every castle has one .
aguilar ?
excuse me , chief .
aguilar , come here a minute .
go ahead .
guys , hold up a minute .
hold up the work .
hold up .
maybe you should go first .
put your name in the wall .
hey , hold up on the work .
come on .
put your name right in here .
spell it out .
a ...
g g g.
scumbags are having at it , sir .
yes , sir .
really ?
they' re calling irwin " chief " .
that' s the word they got for general .
they got substitute names for the other ranks , too , sir .
anybody who was a captain is " boss " .
sergeants are " sport " , privates are " pal " .
playing soldier , sir .
hearts and minds .
sir ?
he' s building a structure of loyalty .
he' s offering them self respect , in exchange for obedience .
the general is building himself an army .
he can have their hearts and minds , sir .
as long as we got ' em by the balls .
well put , corporal .
thank you , sir .
captain .
bring him to my office .
who , sir ?
the prince of venezuela .
who do you think ?
general irwin ?
mr. irwin .
when you first arrived here , i asked you a question .
apparently , i need to ask it again .
what do you want from your time here at the castle , mr. irwin ?
and my answer is the same as it was then .
do my time .
go home .
so you say , but everything you have done has contradicted that .
these men are not here for unpaid parking fines and traffic ...
i' m under no illusion why the men are here , colonel .
i just think they might be reminded ... about some of the good things they' ve done , rather than only the worst .
yes , that is ... that is something my predecessor used to say .
in his last two years here there were seven escape attempts , twelve injury assaults on officers and n. c. o. s , including one killed .
since i' ve assumed command , there have been zero escape attempts , zero injury assaults , zero fatalities .
some may question my methods , but they do work .
no soldier has ever died needlessly under my command , mr. irwin .
see , i , too , share the burden of command .
you may not think that i' ve ever set foot on a battlefield , but that' s because you' ve never sat behind this desk ... this desk .
my men and i are vastly outnumbered .
we spend every day behind enemy lines .
because , make no mistake about it , mr. irwin , they are the enemy .
but i don' t need to justify myself to you , do i ?
i don' t know .
do you ?
this wall ... that has become the focus of so much ... tension ... and turmoil ...
well ... in about two minutes , there will be no more wall .
back away from the wall ...
back away !
come on !
back away from the wall .
come on !
aguilar !
aguilar , damn it !
what is he doing ?
sound the horn .
agui ...
get down !
all inmates remain on the ground ...
aguilar , get down !
what the hell are you doing ?
get down , aguilar .
no !
get down !
hey , what are you doing , ramon ?
get down !
aguilar , get down !
aguilar , get the hell down !
zamorro .
yes , sir .
you bet , sir .
what the hell are you doing ?
get down !
get down !
get down !
aguilar , get down !
get down !
aguilar ?
permission to examine the prisoner , sir .
doc !
come on !
sir .
dellwo .
sir ?
you' re a sergeant major ?
i was .
prisoners !
fall in !
i said , fall in !
let' s go , ladies !
now !
now !
now !
all right !
let' s fall in !
fall in !
we don' t got all day !
come on .
fall in !
you look like a bunch of old women !
fall in , goddamn it !
fall in !
now !
now !
now !
scumbags runnin ' the asylum ?
maybe .
some may think to be remembered in this way ... would be a disgrace to a soldier .
but this is not a disgrace .
the greatest monuments to fallen men ... are not made in marble .
they' re deep in the sea , deep in the jungles , on foreign battlefields , a rifle driven into the ground ... with a helmet on top ... and some tags .
and that is the tribute that this man has earned .
gentlemen , corporal ramon aguilar ,
united states marine corps .
from the halls of montezuma
to the shores of tripoli
' we fight our country' s battles '
in the air on land and sea
first to fight for right and freedom
' and to keep our honour clean '
' we are proud to claim the title '
' of united states marines '
' duh duh , da , da , da , da da , duh duh '
' la , la la , la la la , la '
sir , do you ...
' da da da da da da da da da da '
' da da da da da da da da da '
sound the chow horn .
sir , you still have about ten minutes .
sound it .
yes , sir .
" da da da da ...
present ... arms !
fall ... out !
chow call .
all inmates report to the mess hall .
chow call .
all inmates report to the mess hall .
so , tell me again .
why is it aguilar had to die ?
believe us now ?
i believe you now .
very good .
you have checkmate in five moves .
looks that way , sir .
why you movin ' if i have checkmate in five moves ?
' cause i have checkmate in three .
shall we , uh , call it a draw ?
if you' il excuse us , mister , uh ...
enriquez .
let' s go .
move it out .
your , uh , grandson .
yes .
very cute .
five ?
four , when that picture was taken .
oh .
six now .
it was unfortunate about ...
aguilar .
but tough decisions do go with the job .
burden of command , correct ?
look .
these salutes , i' ve given them some thought .
technically , they are not a violation of regulations .
so , if the inmates can confine themselves to a simple ... hand movement through the hair ,
i see no problem with it .
and if the men want to call you chief , well , that' s fine .
free speech and all that .
okay , then .
no , not okay .
it' s too late , colonel .
it' s too late for what ?
for your offer .
the men don' t want to salute .
they don' t want to use rank .
they don' t want better food .
they don' t want more tv .
they just want your resignation .
so do i.
my resignation ?
you' re a disgrace , colonel .
a disgrace to the uniform .
you should not be allowed to retain your command .
well , then i' d better go pack .
i think you should .
oh ?
tell me , mr. irwin , what' s to stop me from just ... placing you in the hole ... for , say , six months ?
nothing .
if that' s the way you want to win .
sir , if i can make a suggestion ,
maybe we should isolate prisoner irwin ...
get me general wheeler .
yes , sir .
two weeks ago , i watched as he marched a man up and down the yard .
a minor eccentricity .
fine .
since then , he' s been acting as though ... he still has a command in some fantasy army .
and yesterday ...
i don' t think you' d want to make general .
now , you wouldn' t want to give up all these perks , would you ?
sorry .
go on .
yesterday , mr. irwin ... told me he required my resignation .
frankly , i think he' s started to lose the plot .
you saying he' s delusional ?
i' m saying he needs professional psychiatric help .
he' s sick and becoming pathetic .
uh , you might want to be a little more careful in your word choice .
that sick , pathetic man put this star on my shoulder .
yes , sir .
i know .
and i also know that you sat in on his court martial .
and don' t talk about things that are above your pay grade .
hmm ?
yes , sir .
general wheeler , i admire the man as much as you do .
so i want to see that he gets the best care possible .
and i' m not sure that this is the right place for that .
all right .
well , let me see him .
do we read the rules , sir ?
read ' em .
well , sir , normally for a contact visit , folks are limited to one embrace in the beginning and one at the end .
and , uh , hands must be visible at all times , also .
i guess that rules out the hand job .
thank you , gentlemen .
permission to be seated , sir .
permission granted .
what are you doing here , jim ?
i' m here to see if you' ve lost your mind .
uh , he should be available later .
i can take a mes ...
just a second .
good morning , miss kelly .
jim ...
jim , yeah ...
hold on ...
miss kelly ?
miss kelly , i got everything here but ...
the athletic gear .
i found that ...
i found that top one laying on the floor out in the hallway .
hold on one second .
what , danny ?
i found that top one ...
laying on the floor in the hallway .
fine .
thanks , danny .
uh , yeah .
we just needed you to send him up here as soon as possible .
he' s saying you' re delusional , that you' re acting as if you' re still in command of an army .
he' s saying i' m delusional because he wants me gone .
now , if you had ironclad evidence ... of winter killing a man in cold blood for no good reason , then i could do something , maybe .
outside of that , the man' s been investigated three times .
he' s been exonerated three times .
and as far as washington is concerned ,
he' s doin ' a superb job .
yeah , and you' re a convicted criminal .
you could get another investigation .
yes , i could .
but without any new evidence , what would be the point ?
and besides that , gene , honestly ,
i don' t give a rat' s ass .
i don' t care .
what i care about is you and getting you out of here .
now , haven' t you punished yourself enough ?
what i did was wrong , jim .
all teams .
all teams , this is a full s. o. r. t. alert .
repeat ...
all teams , this is a full s. o. r. t. alert .
i cannot let this continue .
now , you will get out of here , and you will go spend some time ... with your daughter and your grandson .
i can have my staff write up a compassionate release on medical grounds .
it can say whatever you want it to say .
there' s nothing wrong with me , jim .
for christ' s sake , will you work with me ?
there is nothing wrong with me .
i see no indication of anything , sir .
of course not .
he' il keep it hidden until the last possible second .
red team , go .
go , go , go !
gene , what the hell is this about ?
is this about control ?
because , you know , no castle can have two kings .
go , go , go , go , go !
get down !
on the floor , now !
general , you must come with us .
what are you doing ?
all inmates remain on the ground in the prone position .
all inmates remain on the ground ...
let' s go !
what is this !
what is this for christ' s sake ?
go !
let' s go !
go , go , go , go !
all right !
sir ?
tear gas ?
return to hangar .
nothing is happening .
it was a bluff .
you can take her home .
return to hangar .
you thought he was gonna try to take me hostage ?
yes , it was a precautionary move .
what the hell kind of ... grab ass unit are you running here , colonel ?
sir , at 11 : 58 this morning , i received a letter ... stating that a group of inmates were planning on taking you hostage at 12 : 10 .
i thought it prudent to act immediately to ensure your safety .
i' ve been hearing some disturbing things about what goes on in here .
and now i' m hearing it from a man i trust and whose opinion i respect .
may i speak freely , sir ?
yes , you may .
with all due respect , general ,
i don' t know what you may have been hearing .
but until you' ve spent some time in the yard with those animals , you have no idea what happens in there .
point taken , colonel .
nevertheless , if i hear ... one more story about a man dying under your command , you are through here .
do you understand me ?
yes , sir .
all right .
as far as gene irwin is concerned , it is my judgment he is as sane as you or i.
i wish he wasn' t .
he is .
frankly , i' d like nothing more than an excuse to get him out of here .
but i see the only way that' s gonna happen is if you request it .
that is true , sir .
so you just ...
you tell me you can' t handle him .
he' s gone .
oh , i think i can handle him , sir .
you watch yourself , colonel .
eugene r. irwin ,
lieutenant general , united states army ,
in direct contravention of an order to evacuate burundi ... by his commander in chief ...
that is the president , for those of you who do not know . " ... selected a platoon of men to extract jackson ngwe , a local warlord .
disregarding reliable intelligence ,
general irwin' s reconnaissance team entered the ville at 0300 .
eight men were captured and executed .
disregarding ... reliable intelligence ... eight men ... were executed .
what i want you men to understand ... is what the consequences can be ... when you choose to follow a man who is motivated ... solely by his pride .
a man who will do anything for one more victory notch on his belt , no matter what the cost , before he fades away .
start the extractions .
over here !
come here !
let' s go .
get out !
get out !
hi , doc .
let' s go for a little walk .
get the fuck back !
open 355 !
open it up !
look at you .
relax , ladies .
hold him down , men !
i had nothing to do with this !
no !
uhh !
why don' t you just execute me ?
no reason for that !
turn him around .
don' t put me in the hole !
oh , don' t ... don' t put me in the hole !
no !
you want that ?
no .
thanks , man .
you bet .
what do we do now ?
jimmy , wait up !
attention , inmates .
all visitation requests must be submitted ... to the s 3 by 1100 today .
all visitation requests ...
so , you really did ...
you really did bluff winter .
the problem is his flush beat your straight .
i don' t play poker , mr. yates .
i play chess .
and in chess , you play with somebody long enough , you come to realize that their first three moves are usually the same .
chess , huh ?
what was his first move ?
what was the first move ?
first , uh , two teams ,
20 men apiece .
like i was saying , the inside teams only have batons .
second ?
second ?
water cannon .
third ?
what kind of chopper ?
chopper .
sir , are you sure we should be having this discussion this man standing ...
you know he can' t be trusted , right ?
i don' t know .
is that how you use the burden of command ?
to make men into ... into , uh , chess pieces ?
yes .
hey , yates .
why don' t you do yourself a favour and run along .
pawns .
that prisoner walking away , who is that ?
uh , that' s ...
that' s yates .
he was an apache pilot , but now he' s a lowlife ... a hustler .
he takes bets .
on what ?
anything .
fights , the weather .
he even took bets on whether irwin was gonna kill himself .
ahhh .
this highly effective officer seems to have no moral grounding whatsoever .
is that so ?
well , that' s what men better than me seem to think , sir .
why are you here , yates ?
i would like your version .
i was involved in a drug smuggling operation from juarez to el paso ... including several of my subordinates , sir .
you were " involved " .
you ran it , did you not ?
correct .
says here that you wore a wire on your men .
is that correct ?
yeah .
and how many years ... did they take off your sentence for ... that ?
four years , sir .
and now you' re the prison bookie .
tell me , yates , how does a man like you ... get into west point ?
my father was a winner of the congressional medal of honour , sir .
oh , right .
well , sometimes the apple does fall far from the tree .
your father ...
your father was a pow with mr. irwin , was he not ?
yes , that is correct .
and yet , you haven' t seen fit to join mr. irwin' s ...
crusade ?
crusade .
why is that ?
it' s not my fight .
mr. irwin is in a fight ?
it says here you have three years ...
left with us .
correct ?
that' s what it says .
that' s what it says .
does three months sound better ?
i need to resolve this situation ... quickly ... before someone else gets hurt ... or killed .
do you agree ?
i guess .
and the way i need to do that is with information .
so , you might want to rethink ... your joining mr. irwin' s ... crusade .
you asking me to be your snitch , sir ?
isn' t it a little late in the game to be self righteous ?
dude , why i got to get my ass kicked ?
how many times you gonna ask ?
stop your sniveling .
i' m only gonna hit you once .
well , when ?
now !
fight !
fight !
fight !
sit your tray down !
hey , fucker !
back off now !
i said back off now !
on your cans !
let' s get on !
sit your asses down , now !
let' s go !
you guys , we don' t have much time .
we can no longer wear the uniform of a soldier .
we forfeited that right .
and that includes me .
i disobeyed an executive order .
i violated my duty as a commanding officer .
and eight men paid a catastrophic price .
it' s a mistake not easy to live with .
so , here i am , just like you , a convicted criminal .
the only difference between you and me is i know i' m guilty .
so we' re packed away here as prisoners .
and one thing is certain .
our captors have the power .
they can try to humiliate us .
they can beat us .
they can lock us away in a dark hole for days on end .
but there' s one thing they cannot do .
they cannot take away from us who we are .
and we are soldiers .
yeah , that' s right .
it is the one thing ...
it is the one thing that gives us a chance in here .
and that nobody can ever take away .
yeah , that' s right .
the uniform code of military justice .
" one .
dereliction of duty .
that' s right .
yeah .
" two .
criminal malfeasance .
" three .
noncompliance with procedural rules .
yeah .
four .
making false official statements .
five .
conduct unbecoming to an officer and gentleman .
yeah !
six .
cruelty and maltreatment of persons under his command .
seven .
command failure resulting in loss of control of facility .
gentlemen , i propose that we seize control of this facility .
take a look at a castle , any castle .
now , break down the key elements that make it a castle .
location .
protection .
garrison .
flag .
the only difference between this castle and all the rest ...
is they were built to keep people out .
forward .
ho .
this castle was built to keep people in .
but it' s still a castle .
and any castle can be taken , whether you' re fighting in the 14th century or the 21st .
to succeed in a castle war , you have to overcome the garrison , take the high ground ... and ultimately capture the flag .
okay ?
enriquez .
all right .
you set up a command post , okay ?
and here , you have the guard ...
well , here .
first of all , this is admin building ,
winter' s office , guards .
okay ?
phase one , neutralize winter' s guards .
phase two , towers .
control the towers , you control the yard .
tower one , tower two , tower three , tower four .
tower four is zamorro ... guy to watch .
phase three , water cannon .
four , helicopter .
helicopter' s the high ground .
takin ' the helicopter' s gonna be a bitch .
but it' s doable .
finally , the flag .
capture the flag .
when we capture the flag , it' s raised upside down .
distress .
right .
right .
upside down means ,
send help .
the fort has fallen .
we raise it upside down , and keep it that way until wheeler arrives and sees it .
then , we' ve won .
yates , shut the fu ...
you see what i mean about him ?
hey , yates , what are you doin ' here , huh ?
i don' t know .
ask him .
he invited me .
general , i know , uh , his father served with you in vietnam , but do we really need him around ?
yeah .
he stays .
duffy ?
you' re in maintenance ?
yes , sir .
yates .
got a minute ?
how am i doin ' ?
five to two , in the colonel' s favour .
well , you don' t think i can win .
he knows too ...
he knows too much .
he' s prepared .
he' s ready .
he may be prepared , yates , but he' s not ready .
you know , we can use you .
hey , look man , i just want to survive this and go home .
you make a deal with him ?
what ?
that' s what i would do if i were him ... go to you .
he knows what you' re capable of .
listen , man .
but so do i.
oh , yeah ?
well , i know what you' re capable of .
i know your type very well .
is that right ?
is that from your infinite years of experience on the battlefield ?
why do you think i should help you ?
can you get me out of here ?
no .
then what are you going to do for me ?
oh , let me guess , you' re going to make me a soldier again ?
is that what you' re doing ?
i get to be all i can be ?
you gonna teach me to salute ?
you know what ?
this is about the time i would be giving you my internal soldier speech .
but the truth is , you probably never should have been a soldier .
your father was .
that' s how i saw him .
you saw him as a disappointment .
okay .
get past it .
that was then .
the only thing that matters here is ... what we are now and what we do now .
this man is going to you because he sees the worst in you .
he' s going to play for the worst .
i want to see the best .
that means there' s no middle .
now , these men need you .
and i need you .
now , it' s your choice .
and don' t tell me you' re surviving here , yates .
you' re hiding .
how' s it going this evening , sir ?
fine , sergeant .
how are you ?
sir ?
prisoner yates wishes to have a word .
give me five minutes , captain .
hi .
hi .
colonel winter' s office .
yeah .
yeah , go ahead and just send it up .
sir .
sir ?
yes .
prisoner yates .
you want me to do this thing for you ?
this 30 days ...
this three months , it' s not gonna cut it .
i got to get out of here immediately .
i got to get out of here tomorrow .
i' m afraid that' s not possible .
look , when this thing explodes , everyone' s gonna know it' s me who yakked .
and then my life' s worth nothing .
so , either you get me out of here immediately ... or you find another guy who knows as much as i do ... and who' s willing to spill it .
good luck .
the soonest i can get you out is one week .
sir , i' m not gonna last ...
i won' t last seven seconds let alone seven days .
well , you can ride the week out in the hole .
no one will get you there .
so what does mr. irwin have planned for us ?
he' s planning to take over the prison .
really .
well , that information won' t get you released .
that information won' t even get you extra potatoes at lunch .
i know the details .
i know how he plans to neutralize your men , how he plans to take over the tower , weapons and tools he' s building .
do you know when ?
yates , i know you' re in there !
yates !
yates , i know you' re in there !
cutbush !
you' re a fucker , yates !
you are gonna snitch !
cutbush , shut up !
cutbush , get down !

no one talks to him .
no one sees him .

place a guard on his cell .
yes , sir !
damn rat !
what' s the problem ?
my mother' s sick .
i' m trying to get a furlough .
shut up !
get him out of here !
captain , with me .

i need more time .
i got to go back into general .
i' il know somethin ' tomorrow .
come get me at 0500 .
i need more time !

colonel ?
colonel .
good morning .
good morning .
so , what do you have for me ?
not much .
not much .
then why are you here ?
i thought there was something you might wanna know .
when they take over the prison , they' re going to fly the flag upside down .
upside down ?
it' s the international sign of distress , sir .
yes , i know what it means .
and where are they going to get a flag ?
they already have it .
yours .
mine .

yes , i know you did .

sir , they found a lot of weaponry .
but no flag .
no , sir .
but at least we have all their weapons .
there' s nothing much they can do now .
how many men do we have searching the tiers ?
we have close to a hundred .
pretty much everybody we could get .
it' s not about the flag .
he wants to be in the yard .
get our men out of the tiers and into the yard now .

you tell your men , ' you' re soldiers . '
' that' s our flag . '
you tell them , ' nobody takes our flag . '
' raise your flag so it flies high where everyone can see it . '
' now you' ve got yourself a castle . '
where the years have gone i have years to go
workin ' for the man to pay the debt i owe
well , the time may pass but the truth will stand
when the good lord shakes this calloused hand
you can call my name it' s time to go
but i' il never be free till it' s chiselled in stone
ain' t no man gonna carry my load
i gotta be a man and do it on my own
devil' s in my path and the hound' s on my heel
have to walk in my shoes just to know how i feel
the devil' s callin ' my name he' s the one who knows
that i' il never be free till it' s chiselled in stone
chiselled in stone
well , i keep on goin ' though there' s no way out
every stone in my path is a brick in my house
a man' s life is built all along the way
by the things that he' s done and the choices he' s made
someday they' il call my name i' il have a place of my own
but i' il never be free till it' s chiselled in stone
on the final day when the whistle blows
i can rest my body i can rest my soul
i built my castle in the promised land
it' s made of rocks and stone and like the shifting sands
when they mention my name after i' m long gone
well , they' il know i' m free ' cause it' s chiselled in stone
chiselled in stone
