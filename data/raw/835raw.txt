high school is like the training wheels ... for the bicycle of real life .
it is a time when young people can explore ... different fields of interests ... and hopefully learn from their experiences .
in coming to terms with my own personal setback ...
i have been able to learn ... that i don' t need to rely on drugs and alcohol ... and that i' m very lucky ... that more people besides myself and kerry ... weren' t injured in the accident .
and i have learned ... that to overcome life' s obstacles ... you need faith , hope ... and above all , a sense of humor .
no more education
it' s time for celebration
' cause this is the day of our high school graduation
we' ve stayed for the duration
achieved matriculation
now we' re the newest members of the general population
god , what a bunch of retards .
god , i know .
i thought that chipmunk face ... was never going to shut up .
i know .
i liked her so much better ... when she was an alcoholic crack addict .
she gets in one car wreck ... and all of the sudden she' s little miss perfect ... and everyone loves her .
let' s see if they gave me the right diploma .
what ?
what ?
these assholes are saying i have to go to summer school ... and take some stupid art class .
why ?
god , i didn' t think that just because you get an " f " ... you have to take the whole class over again .
loser .
wow .
this is so bad , it' s almost good .
this is so bad , it' s gone past good and back to bad again .
at least we' il never have to see ... any of these creepy faces ever again .
unless they' re in your summer school class .
shut up .
don' t turn around .
what ?
why ?
don' t turn around .
damn it .
oh , my god .
you guys , i can' t believe we made it .
yeah .
we graduated high school .
how totally amazing .
so , what are you guys doing this summer ?
nothing .
well , i' m going to this actor' s workshop ... and i' m hoping to start auditions soon .
oh , we have to get together this summer .
yeah .
that' il definitely happen .
well , bye , you guys .
congratulations !
hey , rebecca .
oh , hi .
so , we finally
what about me ?
am i not even here ?
hey , enid .
so , we finally made it , huh ?
yeah .
so , where are you going to go to college ?
we' re not .
really ?
both of you ?
why not ?
just because .
yeah , we made other plans .
i guess i should have figured ... that you two would do something different .
so , todd , what are you going to be when you grow up ?
well , i' m majoring in business administration ... and thinking of minoring in communications , so
see , that' s exactly the type of thing we' re trying to avoid .
look at this .
is stacy himmler going out with rod harbaugh ?
oh , god .
how perfect .
he better watch out , or he' il get alds when he date rapes her .
where is the love
you said you' d give to me
as soon as you were free ?
will it ever be ?
god , just think .
we' il never see dennis again .
good .
no , really .
think about that .
it' s actually totally depressing .
is it crazy for an oil company to care about the environment ?
we don' t think so .
i already told you i' m not going to college .
i think it' s a good idea to keep all your options open .
you can even enroll in the winter quarter .
actually , you could live here ... and go to the city college part time ... and still get a job if you want .
look at me .
i' m not even listening ... to a word you' re saying .
did i tell you who i ran into at the bagel place ?
who ?
guess .
how should i know ?
well , someone from the past .
who ?
you give up ?
yes .
maxine .
not the maxine ?
yeah .
oh , god .
how horrifying .
it' s very good .
jesus .
check out these people behind you .
i' m totally convinced they' re satanists .
so when are we gonna start looking for our apartment ?
soon .
i have to wait and see how this summer class goes first .
god , it' s so weird that we' re finally out of high school .
we' ve been waiting for this our whole lives .
it' s such a weird feeling .
yeah .
it hasn' t really hit me yet .
well , well , well .
if it isn' t enid and rebecca the little jewish girl and her aryan friend .
you' re late , asshole .
fine , and how are you ?
did you bring the tape ?
you never paid me for that tape of the lndian dance routine .
yes , i did .
you jews are so clever with money .
fuck you !
you stupid redneck hick .
oh , my god .
look , the satanists are leaving .
hey , we should follow them .
oh , we totally have to .
oh , my god !
so , what do you do if you' re a satanist , anyway ?
sacrifice virgins and stuff .
well , that lets us off the hook .
how the hell did we get so far behind them ?
i don' t know .
that' s just great .
jesus !
oh , yay .
oh , my god .
look at this .
wowsville " ?
authentic fifties diner ?
since when were there mini malls in the 1950s ?
who could forget this great hit from the fifties , huh ?
i feel as though i' ve stepped into a time warp .
hey , check out the awesome fifties hairdo on our waiter .
hi .
my name is allen ... and i' il be your waiter this afternoon .
hi , al .
can we call you " weird al " ?
i' d imagine so .
you should check out the personals .
maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us .
here we go .
windsurfing doctor , mensan iq , maverick sagittarius .
let' s hit the clubs , make each other laugh .
you can have that one .
jesus , listen to this one .
do you remember me , airport shuttle , june 7 ?
you , striking blond with yellow dress ...
pearl necklace , brown shoes .
i was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan ...
who helped you find your contact lens .
am i crazy , or did we have a moment ?
god , that' s so pathetic .
i mean , she probably didn' t even notice him .
and he' s psychotically obsessing over every little detail .
we should call him and pretend to be the blond .
oh , we totally have to .
it' s his machine .
hi , it' s me .
your striking blond .
of course i remember you .
let' s get together for lunch sometime .
how about friday at 1 : 00 ?
meet me at my favorite restaurant wowsville .
it' s in the mall on century parkway .
see you there , darling .
oh , yeah , and be sure to wear that sexy green cardigan .
oh , it' s that comedian i was telling you about .
i still live with my mother .
he' s the absolute worst .
so what if she' s been dead for fifteen years ?
see ?
that' s barely even a joke .
well , it' s like i always say take my life ... please .
joey mccobb , the weirdest man in show business .
if he' s so weird , how come he' s wearing nikes ?
joey mccobb is our god .
i want to do him .
i bet .
actually , he kind of reminds me ... of that one guy you went out with larry .
god , what look was he going for ... a gay tennis player from the forties ?
fuck you .
you dated him .
why do you have this ?
i don' t know .
you lent it to me in , like , tenth grade .
oh , look at how cute i am .
what a little hose bag .
look , there' s my dad with maxine .
god , look at her .
what a fucking monster .
if he starts dating her again , i' il kill myself .
listen , lady , you tell me you want to relax your hair .
sing it a lullaby or use this .
it' s all i' ve got .
hey , what you doing ?
you have five minutes left on your shift .
well , hello there , young employee of the sidewinder .
look , i already told you guys , i' m not giving you a ride .
what can you tell me , young man ... about the various flavors of frozen yogurt ?
i' il be done in a minute .
can you guys just wait outside ?
i don' t understand .
i simply wish to know
josh , what are you doing ?
in addition to our favorites , chocolate and vanilla ... this week we are featuring six gun strawberry ... wild cherry roundup , and ten gallon tangerine .
i don' t believe i care for any of those .
what' s up , josh ?
give me two packs of cigarettes today .
working overtime .
sixteen hours .
and nature' s nectar , wake up juice .
and give me six of these beef jerkys .
i' m hungry enough to chew the crotch out of a rag doll .
hey !
hey , you !
how many times i tell you ?
no shirt , no service .
get the hell out of my store .
what do you think this is , club med ?
it' s america , dude .
learn the rules .
no , you learn the rules .
we greeks invented democracy .
you also invented homos .
fuck you .
you wish .
you got to buy me dinner first .
so ...
can we talk about this in a minute ?
seriously , i' m , like , this close to being done .
son of a bitch .
what do you think you' re doing ?
turn off that goddamn noise .
rock ' n ' roll , baby .
freedom of speech .
what do you think this is , woodstock ?
that guy rules !
who , doug ?
that guy spends more time in here than i do .
it' s my parking lot !
so , josh , will you please give us a ride ?
please , josh ?
no .
please ?
it' il be super fun .
please , josh ?
look , i don' t see why you guys even need a ride .
you could walk there in two minutes .
it' s just an excuse for us to spend time with you , josh .
if this guy freaks out , will you protect us ?
this guy has every reason to freak out .
this is a pretty fucked up thing to do to somebody .
i think josh is becoming too mature for us .
oh , look , maybe that' s him .
no .
it' s still twenty five minutes too early .
aren' t there a million places like this ?
no .
this is the ultimate .
it' s , like , the taj mahal of fake fifties diners .
so , where' s the weird ai guy ?
there he is back there .
i can see his hair bobbing up and down .
i want to make love to him .
i' m gonna tell him you said that .
so nice to see you again , ladies .
hi , weird al .
my friend here has
shut up !
she says she wants to  shut up !
oh , my god .
god , that is obviously him .
oh , my god .
he just ordered a giant glass of milk .
that' s a vanilla milkshake .
oh , god , this is totally unbearable .
fucking asshole !
what' s wrong with you ?
oh , my god .
it' s him .
can anybody drive ?
he' s insane .
we should follow him home .
forget it .
come on , josh .
don' t you want to see where this guy lives ?
god , he lives right in our neighborhood .
he doesn' t even look all that bummed out really .
i know .
wouldn' t he be , like , totally pissed off ?
this type of thing must happen to him all the time .
mirror , father , mirror .
that piece is entitled " mirror , father , mirror .
i like to show it ... to people that i' m meeting for the first time ... because i think it says so much about who i am ... and what it feels like to inhabit my specific skin .
and this is exactly what i' m hoping to get ... from each of you over the course of this summer a picture of your own self exploration .
now , my own background is in video and performance art ... but i' m hoping that doesn' t influence you too much ... and you' il find your own ways of externalizing the internal .
and at the end of the summer , this class has been invited ... to participate in a show of high school art ... at the neighborhood activity center .
the title of the show will be ...
art as dialogue .
are there any questions so far ?
great !
this is really creepy .
we just need to find out what apartment he' s in ... and we' il stalk him from a distance .
i' m afraid if i see him , i' il feel really bad again .
this is girl mail .
this is computer catalogs and stuff .
the w. c. fields fan club newsletter " ?
oh , my god .
the national psoriasis foundation ?
bingo .
did you hear something ?
come on .
what if he recognizes us ?
eww , look at this .
eww .
gross .
kinda cute .
it looks like a gross rat .
that' s a mongoose .
how much is it ?
that' s not officially for sale .
i might have to hang on to that for the time being .
so , you looking for anything in particular ?
do you have any other old records besides these ?
seymour does .
who does ?
oh , him .
seymour .
he' s the man with the records .
do you have any old lndian records ?
indian records ?
yeah .
you know , like , old lndian 1960s rock ' n ' roll music .
i may have one hindu 78 ... in my collection from the twenties ... but it' s not really for sale .
i don' t really collect foreign .
those are all 78s .
you play 78s ?
maybe not 78s , but i can play regular records .
well , there' s some good stuff in here .
you like old music ?
yeah , it' s good .
there' s some choice lps in here ... that reissue some really great old blues stuff .
how about this one ?
ls it any good ?
no , that one' s not so great .
excuse me .
this is the one i' d recommend .
it' s ...
this track alone by memphis minnie ... is worth about $500 if you own the original 78 .
i know the guy who owns the original ... and lent it for use on this reissue .
wow .
how much is it ? $1 . 75 .
if you don' t like it , you can bring it back for a refund .
we' re here every saturday .
i' m sure it' s ok .
enjoy .
it was so cute how he had his own little bags .
i thought i was going to start crying .
yeah , he should totally just kill himself .
oh , here' s one .
but you have to share with a ...
nonsmoking feminist and her two cats .
i don' t know .
i kind of like him .
he' s the exact opposite of everything i really hate .
in a way , he' s such a clueless dork ... he' s almost kind of cool .
that guy is many things , but he' s definitely not cool .
this would be good , but there' s no kitchen .
yeah , but ... you know what i mean .
not really .
forget it .
i can' t explain it .
oh , my god .
what are you guys doing here ?
what are you doing here , melorra ?
my acting workshop is across the street from here .
i' m just on my break .
well , we won' t keep you .
i love this place .
it' s so , i don' t know ...
you know , funky .
so , what are you guys up to ?
we' re looking for apartments .
god , how cool .
where are you moving ?
we don' t know yet .
that' s why we' re looking .
somewhere downtown .
god , that' s so exciting .
oops , i should go .
bye , you guys .
call me .
bye .
funky .
what , is she black now ?
so , i was thinking that when we look for our apartment ... we have to convince these people that we' re totally rich yuppies .
what are you talking about ?
that' s who people want to rent to .
so all we have to do is buy semi expensive outfits ... and i think it' s no big deal .
it' il be really fun .
honey , have you seen my blue spatula ?
what , are you making pancakes ?
not if i can' t find that goddamn spatula .
that' s just great .
when did you do that ?
god , how long have you been standing there ?
hey , look .
there' s the pants .
where are we going ?
let' s go hassle josh .
hassle ?
oh , look , there he is .
as always .
waiting for the bus that never comes .
i wonder if he' s just totally insane ... or he really thinks the bus is coming ?
why don' t you just ask him ?
hi .
what' s your name ?
norman .
are you waiting for a bus ?
yes .
i hate to tell you this ... but they canceled this bus line two years ago .
there are no more buses on this street .
you don' t know what you' re talking about .
josh !
i bet he' s in there jerking off .
i' il bet he never jerks off .
yeah , he' s beyond human stuff like that .
should we leave a note ?
yeah .
you got a pen ?
yeah .
dear josh , we came by to fuck you ...
but you were not home .
therefore , you are gay .
signed tiffany and amber .
you' re going to leave that ?
why not ?
why do we have to go in here ?
i hate this place .
don' t worry .
it' il only take a second .
whoever told you that bullshit about boiling ... is out of his mind .
carpet beetles are the only way to get flesh off a corpse .
i' m just telling you what he said .
don' t you creeps ever talk about anything nice ?
don' t you ever talk about fluffy kittens or the easter bunny ?
look who' s talking , little miss badass .
yeah , nice outfit .
who are you supposed to be , cyndi lauper ?
blow me , doofus .
oh , my god .
didn' t they tell you ?
tell me what ?
punk rock is over .
i know it' s over , asshole .
want to fuck up the system ?
go to business school .
that' s what i' m going to do .
get a job at some big corporation ... and , like , fuck things up from the inside .
you know , i' m not even trying  yeah , yeah , yeah .
hey , do you have my money ?
oh , how punk .
you know that tape sucked , by the way ?
so sorry if it offended jew .
go die , asshole .
get a job .
god , fuck you .
can we go now ?
you know , it' s not like i' m some modern punk , dickhead .
it' s obviously a 1977 original punk rock look .
johnny fuckface over there is too stupid to realize it .
i didn' t really get it , either .
everyone' s too stupid .
it took me a while before i got a chance to actually play it ... but once i heard that song , it was like
you liked it , huh ?
there' s some really rare performances .
what about did you like the memphis minnie ?
that was good , too .
the whole record was good ... but that one song , " devil got my woman ...
i mostly just keep playing that over and over .
do you have any other records like that ?
there are no other records like that .
actually , i have the original 78 in my collection .
it' s one of maybe five known copies .
wow .
yeah .
do you want to see it ?
i can run upstairs and get it .
sure , yeah .
watch my stuff .
here we go .
it' s ...
it' s only about a b minus .
it' s got an incipient lam crack ... but it plays decent as i recall .
oops , i dropped it !
jeez !
i was only kidding .
jesus , seymour , are you all right ?
yeah , it' s just ... it' s very valuable .
now , last week , i asked you ... to try to create a piece of artwork ... that responds to something you have strong feelings about .
i merely want to help you find ... the best way to look within yourselves ... the best key to your particular lock .
and it looks like we have some really interesting work up here .
thanks .
what can you tell us about your piece ...
phillip ?
it' s about the mutilator .
my goodness .
it' s a really great video game ... about a guy who kills people with a big hammer .
oh .
i thought maybe this was supposed to be your father .
what can you tell us about this piece ..
enid .
enid .
well , it' s kind of a diary , i guess .
colorful .
i think that phillip and enid can help us to see that ... there are many different ways we can express ourselves .
we can do things like these cartoons that are amusing ... as a sort of a light entertainment ... or we can do work that is more serious ... in scope , in feeling , and that deals with issues emotional , spiritual , political ... of great importance .
who is responsible for this ?
i am .
talk to us about it .
it' s my response to the issue of a woman' s right to choose .
it' s something i feel super strongly about .
isn' t this a wonderful piece , class ?
this definitely falls into that higher category of art ...
i was speaking of earlier .
in a world where nothing is what it seems ... in a time of uncertainty ... the future is about to be placed ...
hello .
welcome to masterpiece video .
how may i help you this afternoon , sir ?
i' m looking for a copy of " 8 1/ 2 .
is that a new release , sir ?
no .
it' s the classic ltalian film .
yes , sir .
i' il just check that on the computer for you , sir .
hello !
how are you young ladies this afternoon ?
may i help you find a particular masterpiece movie ?
no .
yes , here it is .
9 1/ 2 weeks " with mickey rourke .
that would be in the erotic drama section .
no , not " 9 1/ 2 , " " 8 1/ 2 .
the fellini film .
how about this one ?
forget it .
i' m sure it sucks .
all these movies suck .
america' s top critics agree
the flower that drank the moon ...
let' s get out of here .
this place makes me sick .
we have to do something fun tonight .
it' s my last weekend of freedom before i start my stupid job .
i know a party we could go to later .
really ?
where ?
it' s a surprise .
some records i will pay serious money for ... provided that they' re a sincere v plus .
other than that , i just prefer to have them on cd .
but cds will never have the presence of an original 78 .
wrong .
a digital transfer , adequately mastered ... will sound identical to the original .
do you have a decent equalizer ?
i have a klipsch 2b3 .
obviously the problem .
you expect a ten band equalizer ... to impart state of the art sound ?
dream a little dream .
it' s never gonna happen .
i totally , totally hate you .
come on .
this is a fun party .
erskine hawkins and his orchestra , do you have that ?
that' s nice , but no .
" golden wedding " ?
oh , i know that .
that' s excellent .
what' s the story with the two cheerleaders over there ?
they' re seymour' s .
seymour ?
no .
you got to be kidding me .
don' t worry about it .
i' ve lived with the guy for five years .
he' s not getting any .
neither are you .
hey , you know what ?
listen to me , joe , all right ?
let me tell you something , joe , ok ?
you can' t score a home run without swinging the bat .
all right ?
physically impossible .
watch and learn , padre .
how' s it going , adam ?
there' s a seat right there .
mind if i sit down ?
yes .
oh , man .
that was cold .
you' re all right .
you' re pretty sharp .
you' re wearing a green dress .
what are you , lrish ?
i bet you' re lrish .
what' s your name ?
melorra .
ah , melorra .
so listen to me , melorra .
let me tell you something .
you seem like an interesting chick .
what are you doing hanging here with all these losers ?
what do you say you and me go hit some night spots ?
well , melorra , i' il be right back .
i' m gonna get a beer .
no , enid , wait .
hey , that' s all right .
it has a large center hole and a hair crack .
but the crack is so tight , it' s completely inaudible .
but a tight hair crack is just that a crack .
i don' t collect cracked records .
i only pay premium on mint records .
seymour , you know that .
please .
so , what was all that about enlarged holes and tight cracks ?
i didn' t think you would have any interest ... in this get together .
if you would have told me you were coming ...
i would have warned you it' s not like a real party or anything .
you' re right about that .
so , is this your record collection ?
god , no .
this is just junk i have for sale .
the record room is off limits .
really ?
here .
are all these records ?
i' ve got about 1, 500 78s at this point .
i' ve tried to pare down my collection ... to just the essential .
look at this room .
this is , like , my dream room .
look at all this stuff .
you are , like , the luckiest guy in the world .
i would kill to have stuff like this .
please .
go ahead and kill me .
oh , come on .
what are you talking about ?
you think it' s healthy to obsessively collect things ?
you can' t connect with other people ... so you fill your life with stuff .
i' m just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers .
no , you' re not .
you' re a cool guy , seymour .
then how come i haven' t had a girlfriend in four years ?
i can' t even remember the last time a girl talked to me .
i' m talking to you .
you know , i bet there are tons of women ... who' d go out with you in a minute .
i know i could get you a date in , like , two seconds .
good luck .
i mean it .
you leave everything to me ...
i' m going to be your own personal dating service .
yeah , well , we should get back .
by the end of this summer ... you' re going to be up to your neck in pussy .
jesus .
what about her ?
would you go out with her ?
what kind of a question is that ?
it' s totally irrelevant , because a girl like that ... would never be caught dead with me .
yeah , but put that aside for now .
would you go out with her ?
i really didn' t get a good look at her .
yes , you did .
whoa .
what about her ?
are you into girls with big tits ?
jesus .
i mean , as long as she' s not a complete imbecile ... and she' s even remotely attractive ...
hey , look , there' s norman .
hi , norman .
we need to find a place where you can go ... to meet women who share your interests .
maybe i don' t want to meet someone who shares my interests .
i hate my interests .
list your five main interests in order of importance .
i' d have to put traditional jazz , blues ... and then ragtime at the top of the list .
right , so let' s just say music .
that way , we only use up one .
all right .
can we go in here for a second ?
just for a second .
just stopping by to say hi .
this is my friend seymour .
ok .
well , we' il see you later , josh .
josh , what you goddamn doing ?
clean up that fucking mess !
jesus .
so , was that your boyfriend ?
josh ?
he' s nobody' s boyfriend .
he' s just this guy that becky and i like to torture .
but do you ...
are you going out
oh , my god .
we have to go in here .
come on .
yeah , sure .
very funny .
come on .
please ?
becky and i have been dying to go in here ... but we can never find any boys to take us .
i would really rather not .
come on .
please ?
just for a minute .
it' il be a riot .
i don' t think so .
please .
please .
oh , my god .

at least the wheelchair guy is entertaining .
he doesn' t even need that wheelchair .
he' s just totally lazy .
that rules .
no , it really doesn' t .
you' il see .
you' il get totally sick of all the creeps ... and losers and weirdos .
but those are our people .

sweetie , you remember maxine ?
i' m going to go to bed .
i' m really tired .
honey , i made spaghetti .
you don' t want some ?
no .
i have to get up early for class tomorrow .
it' s really quite something to see you all grown up , enid .
i' d love to know what you' re doing now .
i can' t help but feel ...
i had some small part in how you turned out .
what are you studying ?
you were always such a smart little girl .
i' m taking a remedial high school art class ... for fuck ups and retards .
who is this , enid ?
it' s supposed to be don knotts .
and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject ?
i don' t know .
i just like don knotts .
interesting .
what do we have here , margaret ?
it' s a tampon in a teacup .
i can see that .
what can you tell us about it ?
first of all , what kind of sculpture is this ?
it' s a found object .
that' s where an artist takes an ordinary object ... and places it in an artistic context ... and thus , it becomes art .
but what can you tell us about it ... in regard to your artistic intent ?
well , i guess i see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood .
such as tea parties in the olden days ... but instead of tea ...
i was trying to kind of confront people with this
this shocking image of repressed femininity .
right .
exactly .
well , i think it' s a really wonderful piece ... and it illustrates perfectly what i was saying ... about not being afraid to use controversial imagery .
oh .
well , this looks like the work of phillip .
hey , you see that guy over there ?
which one ?
the blond guy over there .
he gives me , like , a total boner .
he' s , like , the biggest idiot of all time .
you guys up for some reggae tonight ?
ok , you' re right .
sometimes i think i' m going crazy ... from sexual frustration .
and you haven' t heard of the miracle of masturbation ?
heads up .
my band' s playing here on friday night ... and there' s going to be a bunch of cool bands playing ... and you don' t have to pay ... if you show them this flier at the door .
you should come check it out .
which band is yours ?
it' s alien autopsy .
oh .
bitchin ' .
yeah , well ... maybe i' il see you there .
yeah .
thanks .
god , what a dork .
you' re just jealous .
trust me , at this point , i' m past the fact ... that every single guy likes you better than me .
oh , face it .
you just hate every single guy ... on the face of the earth .
that' s not true .
i just hate all these extroverted , obnoxious ... pseudo bohemian losers .
the donnie g show .
donnie g !
nothing but classic rock ... coming at you this beautiful evening .
you' re listening to kfto
god , that asshole' s voice is so hateful .
no wonder i never listen to the radio .
relax , seymour .
relax .
he' s just so shrill and loud and piercing .
i feel like i' m being jabbed in the face .
kto coming at you on this beautiful evening .
so ...
thank you .
why' d you bring the record ?
i brought it so he can autograph it .
he' s going to be amazed to see it .
it' s one of only two known copies .
i can' t believe they have him as the opening act ... and not the headliner .
it' s what an insult .
there' s gonna be lots of girls to pick from at this bar .
i' m not holding my breath in that department .
what , are we in slow motion here ?
what are you , hypnotized ?
have some more kids , why don' t you ?
jesus christ , move it !
seymour !
god .
i can' t believe these people .
they could at least turn off their stupid sports game ... until he' s done playing .
thank you .
don' t go away .
we got blues hammer coming up in just a minute .
hey , check that out .
she' s nice , but , you know ...
offer her a seat .
i' il do it .
no , no , no , no .
wait .
let me think of something to say to her first .
that was great music , huh ?
yeah , i just love blues .
actually , technically , what he was mostly playing ... would more accurately be classified in the ragtime idiom .
although , of course , not in the strictest sense ... of the classical ragtime piano music ...
iike that of scott joplin or joseph lamb .
authentic blues has a more conventional ... twelve bar structure in its stanzas .
oh .
if you like authentic blues ... you really gotta check out blues hammer .
they' re so great .
all right , people , are you ready to boogie ?
' cause we gonna play some authentic ... way down in the delta blues .
so get ready to rock your world !
well , i been plowin ' behind the mule , son
picking cotton all day long
yes , i been plowin '
picking cotton all day long
i said , lordy , baby
but my woman she be gone
now i remember why i haven' t been anywhere in months .
it' s simple for everybody else .
you give them a big mac and a pair of nikes ... and they' re happy .
i can' t relate to ninety nine percent of humanity .
i can' t relate to humanity , either ... but i don' t think it' s completely hopeless .
well , it' s not completely hopeless for you .
i' m not even in the same universe ... as those creatures back there .
we just need to find you a place ... where you can meet someone ... who isn' t a complete idiot , that' s all .
why do you care so much if i get a date or not ?
i don' t know .
i guess i just can' t stand the idea of a world ... where a guy like you can' t get a date .
what is this , seymour ?
oh , that .
i borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago .
i guess it' s mine now .
what are you , a klansman or something ?
yeah , i' m a klansman .
you know the cook' s chicken franchise ?
four piece cook' s special ...
deep fried with side and slaw .
it' s outrageous !
yeah , well , cook' s is just a made up name .
back in 1922 ... they were originally called coon chicken lnn .
that' s an early painting of their first logo .
how come everybody doesn' t know this ?
it' s ancient history .
same reason nobody knows about this lionel belasco record .
i was more interested in the whole cook' s phenomenon ... when i was about your age .
sort of lost interest when i started working for them .
you work for cook' s chicken ?
for nineteen years .
were you a fry cook or something ?
nothing so glamorous , actually .
i' m an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters .
jesus .
i' d go nuts if i had to work in an office all day .
so i don' t really get it .
are you saying that things were better back then ... even though there was stuff like this ?
i suppose things are better now , but ...
i don' t know , it' s complicated .
people still hate each other ... but they just know how to hide it better .
can i borrow this ?
for what ?
i promise i' il take good care of it .
they' re very sensitive about that kind of stuff at work .
don' t you trust me , seymour ?
let' s address discussion to this piece .
i don' t like it .
can you tell us why ?
i don' t know .
i think it' s totally weird .
it' s totally offensive .
yeah .
i agree .
it' s not right .
well , these are all valid comments , but ...
i think we should see if the artist ... has anything to bring to this .
well , i found this when i was doing some research ... and i discovered that cook' s chicken ... used to be called coon chicken .
so i decided to do my project based on this discovery ... as kind of a comment on racism ... and how it' s whitewashed over in our culture .
did you actually do this painting ?
well , no , it' s more of a found art object .
how do you think this addresses the subject of racism ?
it' s complicated .
i guess i' m trying to show ... how racism used to be more out in the open ... and now it' s hidden or something .
and how do you think an image like this ... helps us to see that ?
i' m not sure .
i guess because when we see something like this ... it seems really shocking .
and we have to wonder why it' s so shocking .
i don' t really know what to say , enid .
i think it' s a remarkable achievement .
i' m going to let you handle the 4 : 30 crowd by yourself .
that way , i can evaluate your performance while it' s slow .
then we' il ease you into the big crowds , all right ?
you can count on me , sir .
cool .
do you serve beer or any alcohol ?
i wish .
actually , you wish .
after about five minutes of this movie ... you' re going to wish you had ten beers .
what are you doing ?
you don' t ever criticize the feature .
why ?
what' s the difference ?
i mean , we already got his money .
look , that' s the policy , ok ?
if you want to make up your own rules ... open up your own theater .
and let me have lots of butter on it .
here you go .
smothered in delicious yellow chemical sludge .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
what ?
i was just joking around with the customers .
it' s my shtick .
well , lose it .
and why aren' t you pushing the larger sizes ?
didn' t you get training about up sizing ?
yeah , but i feel really weird .
it' s pretty sleazy .
it' s not optional !
jesus .
hi .
can i get a medium 7 up ?
medium ?
why , sir , do you not know that for a mere 25 cents more ... you could purchase a large beverage ?
and you know , i' m only telling you this ... because we' re such good friends .
medium is really only for suckers ... who don' t know the concept of value .
what are you talking about ?
what kind of loser gets fired after one day ?
look , i told you .
the manager was a total asshole .
i' il get another job .
besides , i have some ideas to make money in the meantime .
i can' t believe you' re selling some of this stuff .
fuck it .
everything must go .
i remember this hat .
this was during your little old lady phase .
how much is this ?
that' s not for sale .
wait a minute .
it says five dollars .
i know , it' s ...
that' s a mistake .
i' m not selling it .
what was that all about ?
i thought " everything must go .
yeah , right .
like i' d let some asshole with a soul patch own goofy gus .
how much for this dress ?
god , i can' t believe you' re selling that .
that' s five hundred dollars .
what ?
five hundred .
you' re crazy .
it should be , like , two dollars .
i was wearing that when i lost my virginity .
why do i care about that ?
why do you want it ?
it would look stupid on you anyway .
god !
fuck you !
so , now are you going to get a regular job ?
do you want to do something tonight ?
i can' t .
it' s seymour' s birthday tonight .
oh , shit .
what time is it ?
i' m supposed to go to the store .
i was going to make him a cake .
do you still want to go shopping tomorrow ?
yeah , i guess .
call me .
since when can you make a cake ?
ok , you can open your eyes now .
oh , hey .
thanks , enid .
i really appreciate it .
no , blow it out , doofus .
are you ok ?
yeah .
oh , it' s just my stupid back .
i' il be all right in a minute .
what is that ?
it' s ...
it' s just this elastic thing i have to wear sometimes ... for lumbar support .
what , like a girdle ?
maybe now you can understand why i can' t get a date .
well , at least you' re not the only one .
i think only stupid people have good relationships .
that' s the spirit .
actually , there is this one guy i have a crush on right now ... but ... totally fucked up situation .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
you met him , remember ?
that guy josh .
but i can' t do anything about it ... because becky would totally freak out .
why ?
just forget it .
it' s complicated .
aren' t you going to get that ?
let the machine get it .
i have no desire to talk to anyone who might be calling me .
i knew it .
it' s my mother .
hi , i' m calling for ...
you placed an ad in " the weekly " over a month ago , and ... well , i' m the blonde in the yellow dress .
at least , i think i am .
i saw the ad when you first placed it ... but i was in this relationship at the time ... so i cut the ad out , and ... and i' m not in a relationship anymore .
god , this is really confusing .
don' t !
anyway , if you still want to talk to me ...
i can be reached at 555 2673 .
that' s my work number ... and my name is dana .
ok !
bye .
wow .
what was all that about ?
it' s just somebody' s idea of a joke .
that didn' t sound like a joke to me .
what , did you place an ad in the personals or something ?
yeah , a long time ago .
she called before .
it' s just somebody trying to humiliate me .
i think you should call her back .
oh , look .
we have to get these .
you know , i can' t afford stuff like this right now .
look , i' m sick of waiting .
i mean , we have to get stuff if we' re ever going to move .
aren' t these the greatest ?
what ?
they' re nice .
i can' t imagine spending money on plastic cups .
you don' t have to .
i' il pay for everything now ... and you can pay me back when you finally get a job .
you' re insane .
so , are we still going to that thing tonight ?
what thing ?
you know , that guy' s band is playing tonight .
alien autopsy .
actually , seymour' s big date is tonight .
and i kind of want to be around when he calls ... you know , so i can hear how badly it went .
god , i' m so sick of seymour .
that was great .
jeez , thanks a lot for cooking .
i love to cook .
most women wouldn' t invite a guy over on the first date , but ...
i think you should trust your instincts .
when i talked to you on the phone ... you just seemed so ...
i don' t know , so harmless .
thanks .
i love this song .
isn' t it great ?
doesn' t it make you want to dance ?
come on .
no , i don' t really dance .
come on , seymour .
don' t be silly .
anybody can dance .
here , follow me .
watch my feet .
no , really .
come on , seymour .
just feel the music .
loosen up .
it' s all in your head .
here , let' s put down your bowl of ice cream .
wow , it' s 9 : 00 already .
if we' re gonna make that movie , don' t you think we should go ?
ok .
party pooper .
i' m so excited to see this film .
dustoff varnya is such a brilliant director .
did you see his last film ...
the flower that drank the moon " ?
it was glorious .
must have missed that one .
then again , what do i know ?
i like laurel and hardy movies .
really ?
i never really cared for those .
why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one ?
hello ?
hey .
it' s me .
oh , hi .
so , what happened ?
actually , it' s still kind of happening .
she' s over here right now .
i think it' s going pretty well .
what ?
you' re joking .
yeah , so i better go .
it' s not really the best time to talk , ok ?
what , are you going to have sex with her on your first date ?
jesus !
i' il talk to you later , ok ?
bye .
that was my mother .
do you still want to do something tonight ?
what happened to seymour ?
i can' t believe this .
he actually scored .
god , how repulsive .
so , should i come over ?
actually , i was just about to go out with some friends .
what are you talking about ?
who ?
just some people from work .
i don' t believe you .
you said you were busy , so ...
look , i better get going .
i guess i' il call you tomorrow .
boo !
please .
boy .
so , where have you been ?
i' ve been looking all over for you .
i' ve been wandering the streets day and night ... trying to find you .
really ?
no .
joe told me where you are .
but how come you never call me anymore ?
i' m sorry .
i' ve just been really busy .
so , how are things going with ...
what' s her name ?
dana ?
pretty well .
surprisingly , you know .
it' s good .
what do you do together ? ls she into your old records and stuff ?
yeah , sort of .
i mean , she doesn' t dislike that stuff .
anyway , she' s trying .
actually , we' re supposed to go antique shopping ... for her apartment this afternoon .
sounds good .
so , we should get together .
i' il definitely give you a call this week or something .
are you trying to get rid of me ?
no , no , no .
it' s just that i ...
i should be going in a few minutes , and ...
aren' t you even going to ask how i' m doing ?
sorry .
so , how are you ?
i don' t know .
good , i guess .
oh , hello .
guess i' m a little early .
this is enid .
hello .
it' s great to finally meet you .
so , how do you two know each other ?
i' m kind of surprised he hasn' t mentioned me .
we' re old friends .
really ?
yeah .
very close .
in fact , i was standing right next to him ... the first day you called .
you know , if it wasn' t for me ... he would have never called you back .
is that right ?
i would have
well , i' ve really got to get going ... but i' il stop by and see you sometime , seymour .
it really was great to meet you .
now remember , the art show is this saturday ... 7 : 30 p . m . , sharp .
oh , and justin .
i' m sorry .
i' m gonna really miss all of you people .
i hope that each of you feels as if you' il be ... taking away something from this experience .
thanks .
so long , everyone .
enid , can i speak to you for a moment ?
uh oh .
don' t worry , it' s nothing bad .
i got a call from a close friend of mine ... at the academy of art and design ... and she tells me i' m allowed to place one student ... from your graduating class for a full one year scholarship ... and i took the liberty of submitting your name .
as far as i know it includes housing ... and meals and everything .
it' s really quite an offer .
let me know as soon as you can , enid .
this could be a really great thing for you .
pumpkin ?
honey ?
i' m coming in .
well , i have some good news .
what is it now ?
are you still looking for a job ?
i guess .
maxine thinks she can get you a job at computer station .
normally , you have to have a lot of references .... and at least two years of experience ... but she thinks she can convince them .
tell her to forget it .
i don' t need her help .
ok , that' s ...
you know , if that' s ...
if mm hmm .
awful !
just awful !
i will take care of it , i promise you .
i will handle it .
thank you .
excuse me .
i' m sorry , i need to speak with her for a second .
well , enjoy the show .
thank you .
yes , what is it , phyilis ?
i am sorry ... but you are simply going to have to remove that painting .
several of the parents have complained about it already .
well , i will do no such thing .
then i' m going to go over there and take it down myself .
i think we should give the artist a chance ... to talk with the parents about her intentions with this piece .
we should be promoting discussion as a solution ... instead of censorship .
censorship ?
yes .
oh , that is such a big word for you , roberta .
excuse me .
do not touch that  ok , i have a solution .
thank you , everyone , for your patience .
margaret , have you seen enid ?
i don' t think she' s even here .
you' re kidding .
all right .
there we go .
thank you very much .
so excuse me .
so there' s this stupid art show i' m going to tonight ... and i want you to be my date .
there' s something i want to show you .
yeah , i ...
i don' t think i should .
of course you should .
i' m already a million hours late .
come on .
i better not .
ok , well , forget the art show .
let' s do something else , then .
i really wish i could , enid , but ...
dana just got out of a really bad relationship ... and i don' t want her to have the wrong idea , you know ?
hey , what' s happening ?
where' d you get those pants ?
they were a present from dana .
you like them ?
they a good fit ?
yeah , whatever .
i mean , what do i know about clothes ?
it' s nice to have somebody do all the work for me .
i' il just be in my room .
what' s her deal , anyway ?
did she actually tell you that you can' t see me anymore ?
no .
no , i mean ...
not exactly .
she just ...
she just doesn' t understand how i would know someone like you .
what does that mean , " someone like me " ?
just someone so young .
don' t worry .
i won' t bother you anymore .
do you remember me ?
sure .
sure .
you' re , like , the only person in this world i can count on ... because , no matter what , i know you' il always be here .
well , that' s what you think .
i' m leaving town .
where are we ?
this is such a weird neighborhood .
this is a totally normal , average neighborhood .
3128 .
that must be it .
great .
what ?
what' s wrong with it ?
it looks totally normal .
what ?
i said great .
yeah , i can tell you really love it .
what am i supposed to say ?
gee , i can' t wait to live in some depressing shit hole ...
out in the middle of nowhere " ?
you know , you hate every single place that we look at .
why don' t you just tell me you don' t want to live with me ?
because you' il totally freak out and act like a psycho about it .
what ?
you' re the psycho .
you' ve totally ignored me ever since high school ended .
you' re still living out some stupid seventh grade fantasy !
your own apartment .
fuck you .
have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life .
god .
fuck you , too .
pumpkin ?
pumpkin ?
honey ?
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
because , honey , if something' s wrong ...
i' d love it if we could talk about it .
it' s nothing .
it' s just some hormonal thing .
don' t worry about it .
ok , because i have some very , very important news ... to talk about ... and if you' re not feeling well , we can do this some other time .
what ?
well , maxine and i have been seeing a lot of each other .
and we were thinking it might be really best ... for all of us if at the end of the summer ... she came here to live with us .
we could really just see how we got along together ... and see if this is
is this your first death mask ?
all artists have to suffer .
just a minute .
i brought the application for the art academy .
i just hope it' s not too late .
i am so sorry about what happened , enid .
what do you mean ?
well , the whole business with the art show ... and the newspaper it' s just absolutely ...
they' re forcing me to give you ... a non passing grade in the class .
can' t i still get a scholarship to the art academy ?
well , i' m sorry , enid  can you help me out here ?
i can' t breath under this mask .
excuse me .
that' s fine .
just breathe .
don' t worry about it .
hey , what are you doing here ?
i needed to see you .
what' s up ?
can you at least let me in ?
yeah , sure .
come on in .
look , i just need someone to be nice to me for five minutes ... and then i swear i' il leave you alone , ok ?
what' s the matter ?
do you have anything to drink ?
there might be some root beer .
what' s this ?
that' s dana' s .
we' re supposed to be saving it for our two month anniversary .
you better not
i mean , you like me , right , seymour ?
we' re good friends , right ?
yeah , sure .
of course .
what is this ?
dana got it when we went shopping for antiques .
she said it didn' t go with her stuff ... so she gave it to me .
said it would go better with my old time thingamajigs .
jesus , how can you stand her ?
how come all that time i was trying to get you a date ... you never asked me out ?
you' re a beautiful young girl .
i couldn' t imagine you' d have any interest in me ... except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity .
at least you' re not like every other stupid guy in the world .
all they care about is guitars or sports .
i hate sports .
maybe i should just move in with you .
i could do the cooking and dust your old records ... until i get a job .
you know what my number one fantasy used to be ?
what ?
i used to think about one day ... just not telling anyone and going off to some random place .
and i' d just disappear ... and they' d never see me again .
do you ever think about stuff like that ?
i guess i probably did when i was your age .
you know what we should do ?
we should just get in your car right now and just drive off .
just find some totally new place ... and start a whole new life .
fuck everybody .
i' m not in any good condition to drive .
i' m serious .
i' m just so sick of everybody .
why can' t i just do what i want ?
what do you want ?
what do you want ?
don' t you like me ?
boy , i never expected anything like this to happen .
yeah , well , me , neither .
you must know i always ...
did you mean all that stuff about moving in with me ?
i was just thinking out loud .
i mean , you' ve got this thing with dana , and ...
i' m not gonna let you fuck that up .
yeah , but i don' t know , i just ...
i really need to get some sleep .
good night .
right .
one second .
sorry .
go ahead .
we' re almost done .
hi .
yeah .
no , it' s excluded .
they' ve already paid the earnest money .
well , let' s see if they bring it up ... if they notice it on the final walkthrough .
right .
great .
sounds good .
yes !
we did it !
great job .
thank you .
i' m proud of you .
i' il catch you guys later .
i' m going to start the paperwork .
congratulations .
thank you .
have a seat .
so , what brings you down here ?
i just really feel like i need to say something to you .
i' ve never said this to anyone before .
believe me , i' ve ...
i' ve stayed in horrible relationships for years ... just so i wouldn' t have to do this .
what are you trying to say ?
maybe it' s not such a good idea that we keep going out .
it' s enid .
leave a message .
seymour , here .
i really want to talk to you .
i' ve been thinking about what you said ... about moving in here , and ...
yeah , so just ... give me a call when you get a chance .
ok .
thanks .
bye .
look , i' m really sorry about the other day .
i don' t know what' s wrong with me .
i really do want to move in with you .
look , i don' t know .
i was thinking maybe i should just live alone , you know ?
i' ve decided to rent that place that we looked at ... and i start moving in next week .
please let me come with you .
please .
look , i don' t know .
i don' t think it' s such a good idea .
of course it' s a good idea .
it' s our plan .
yeah , but how are you going to pay rent and everything ?
you don' t even have a job .
i' il get a job tomorrow .
i promise .
maxine said she could get me a job at computer station .
please , becca .
tonight , i have a very special partner one who is a performance artist ... in sign language for the deaf .
please welcome to the stage ...
well , here' s where the fun never stops .
she could at least have the decency to call me back .
wasted time , trying to logically figure out the female brain .
that' s for sure .
maybe she got another boyfriend .
yeah , well , thanks for cheering me up .
oh , god .
it' s enid .
leave a message .
oh , come on .
hey , look at it this way ... at least things can' t get any worse .
seymour !
just the man i want to see .
step in here for a minute .
have a seat .
what can you tell me about this , seymour ?
so , what do you think ?
it' s fine .
where' s all your stuff ?
there .
that' s all you' re bringing ?
no .
i' m gonna pack up the rest tonight .
i' il bring it over sometime tomorrow .
what time ?
i don' t know .
noon ?
all right , cool .
just make sure you' re here by then ... because we got a lot of stuff to do .
oh , wait .
i got to show you this .
it' s really cool .
isn' t it great ?
