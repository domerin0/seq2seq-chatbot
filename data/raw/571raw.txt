this motion picture is set over the mediterranean sea in an age when ... seaplanes ruled the waves .
it tells the story of a valiant pig who ... fought against flying pirates for his pride , for his lover , and for his fortune .
the name of the hero of our story is crimson pig . .
the crlmson plg
yeah ?
porco rosso , get going .
mamma aiuto " is on the move .
mamma aiuto ?
i don' t need a cheap job .
a charter ship from venice was attacked .
they' re stealing fuel from the ship .
is that all ?
ah ...
well ...
some vacationing girl school children on are on board .
it' s going to cost more than you think .
i' m going to apply clause three of the contract to this case .
and clause four , too .

we' re gonna be kidnapped !
wow !

yeah .
you guys are called air pirates , aren' t you ?
you know a lot .
it' s a skull .
neat , isn' t it ?
hurry up with the kids !
i' m busy .
do you want all 15 of them ?
of course .
it' s not nice for a girl to be left behind .
i' m too late .
the girls were kidnapped !
bring the girls back !
they went that way !
i know what they' re thinking .
since they' re poor and stingy , they' il want to save gas .
so , they' il change course for the nearest island as soon as they' re out of sight .
crap !
dammit .
this is no good .
there they are !
what the heck is this ?
a sightseeing plane around the islands .
look at that !
it' s a pig .
what a cute pig .
you girls could be kidnapped here .
watch out , babes !
cool !
what a nuisance !
we are flying !
let me see , let me see !
hey , don' t !
shut up , shut up .
please !
hey , do something , will you ?
that' s why i asked if we wanted to take all of them .
ok , just for a little while .
wow !
wonderful !
hey , look at that !
a red plane .
where ?
where ?
it' s over there , right ?
yeah .
that' s as far as you go .
see , here he comes .
that' s porco rosso !
hey , i can' t see .
it stopped .
we' re gonna fall .

what the heck are you doing ! ?
shoot , shoot him , shoot him down !

they' re very valuable hostages to us !
don' t worry , mister .
we' re all students at the swimming school .
oh , no .
no !
me , too .
another message from the pig !
i' m going to let you to take half of the gold coins .
but leave the rest of the coins and the hostages , behind !
if you don' t , i' m going to kill you all !
that' s what he says .
a half of the coins ! ?
shut your mouth !
come on , pig .
let' s fight it out !
here we go !
it' s broken .
we give up !
we give up !
good bye !
play with us again
good bye !
this is great .
we have enough money for repairs
you , idiot .
be more greedy !
quiet down .
quiet down , will you ! ?
don' t touch that , you' il break it .
stay away from the propeller .
pee ?
do it around there , please .
mamma aiuto' s men said they couldn' t come to see us .
damn !
how can a pig be such a hero ?
that young fella is an american , isn' t he ?
if he is , that' s a shame for the pilots of the adriatic .
oh , not at all .
his grandmother is quarter italian .
we should do something about the porco .
we have a great deal of trouble .
but , 10 % !
that' s not fair .
when we will sing in the time of cherries
happy nightingales and mocking thrush
will all celebrate .
lovely ladies will be dreaming of follies
beautiful ...
and lovers will have sun in their heart .
when we will sing in the time of cherries .
the mocking thrush will trill much better .
but it is so short , the time of cherries
when we go together , pretending
to pick earrings .
cherries or love , both clothed alike ,
fall under the leaves , like drops of blood .
but it is so short , the time of cherries ,
coral pendants we picked while dreaming .
here he comes .
he stinks .
what a fake !
i will always love the time of cherries .
it is then that i hold a wound in my heart .
porco rosso !
i' m a reporter for the neptune .
you did another great job , again .
i think " mamma aiuto " isn' t going to show up again for a while .
anyway , about your estimated bounty this year
they say it must be more than last year' s ...
wait .
let go of me .
hey !
listen to a song in silence .
she' s wonderful .
she is a wonderful lady .
madam gina of the hotel adriano ... ... is famous among the pilots throughout this country .
while she sings , even pirates and bounty hunters become good guys .
is that plane up front yours ?
yeah , it' s a plane of the rattle snake , bringing me fame and fortune .
that plane beat an italian at the schneider cup , twice .
not only is it fast , ...
it' s also and excellent fighter .
i heard there' s a little pig named porco rosso who' s famous around here .
if you' re dealing with the air pirates , watch your tail " cowboy .
they' re misers , and are poor , too .
they stink , because they don' t take showers .
i know that .
what ?
come on , you little chicken !
may i help you , gentlemen ?
what' re you up to tonight ?
you' re up to no good , aren' t you ?
i' m glad you came , but don' t play war games .
we know , gina .
we don' t work within 50km of this establishment .
we' re even getting along with that pig .
you' re good boys .
see you later .
hey , what are you doing ! ?
porco , tell me the whole story .
next time we' re alone .
that american is really funny .
as soon as he saw me , he proposed .
i' ve married three pilots ...
the first died in the war , ... the second died in atlantic ocean , ... and the last one died in asia .
you got the news ?
i got it today .
it says the remains were found in the forests of bengal .
i' ve been waiting for three years .
my tears dried up long ago .
good guys always die .
for my friend .
marco , thank you for staying with me all these years .
you' re the best friend .
the only thing i don' t like is that you won' t take that picture down .
don' t break it , you promised me .
that' s the only picture left of you as a human .
how can we break your curse ?
that american is very talented .
i envy you .
i wish i could make money like you .
this is the payment for this month .
you' ve paid off the entire loan for the airplane .
let' s see ...
how about buying some patriot bonds in devotion to our country ?
i' il leave that to the " humans .
welcome , mr. porco rosso .
it' s ready .
give me 60 rounds of ammo as well .
o. k.
the country' s busy , isn' t it ?
oh , yeah .
the government is probably going to change .
if so , people like you will be outlaws .
country " and " law " don' t mean anything to a pig .
you' re right ,
the same goes for a mole .
is it ok , like usual ?
we have a new supply of an incendiary bomb .
hey , kid .
i' m not going to war .
see you .
thanks for coming .
excuse me , boss .
could you tell me the difference between a soldier and a bounty hunter ?
one' s scum if he can' t win in war .
the other' s useless and stupid if he can' t make a fortune .
who ever heard of an air pirate who was deep in debt ?
we had nothing to barter with , captain .
we couldn' t even afford paint .
there' re ships up ahead !
crap .
why do i have to stay with such pathetic looking group ?
it' s due to the pig , the crimson pig .
take a look at that .
mama aiuto " don' t even have money for paint .
sorry looking chumps .
well , we' re all here .
hey , is the american around ?
yeah , he' s in the sun .
just like he told us .
target sighted !
it' s the queen of mediterranean !
are we going to take on such a big ship ?
that' s why we prepared well .
don' t be afraid !
i' m having engine trouble .
you go first .
you are cunning !
do as we agreed !
we share the cost of repairs when we loose , don' t we ?
you , stingy ...
of course we share them !
wait a minute ...
engine trouble ...
shut up !
knock it off !
attention please .
attention please .
air pirates are attacking this ship .
but there is nothing to worry about .
this ship has excellent fighters .
let me introduce the pilots .
no .
1 is the black stallion , signore bulkar .
no . 2 is the seawolf , visconti .
i didn' t know they had fighter protection .
ah , ah , they' re upset .
let' s get out of here !
all right , wait there .
this engine' s finally had it .
looks like i' il have to take it to milan .
... but they succeeded in escaping by parachute .
the air pirates , who took all the money and gold from the ship ...
you' re next , pig !
come get it , pig !
i repeat that ...
you are next , pig .
come get it , pig !
this crime ...
you guys are special kind of trash .
i' m sorry , but i' m going on vacation .
white sheets ...
beautiful ladies ...
hang in there to milan , engine chan .
i don' t like this weather .
i guess i' il have to go under the clouds .
be a good girl , hang in there .
you' re a good girl , engine chan .
rosso !
fight me man to man .
i don' t have time to play with you now .
don' t run away , or i' m going to tell everybody about it .
see you later , american !
damn , i' m out of the clouds .
oh oh .
gotcha !
no , you didn' t .
it' s broken .
did it !
i' m going to be famous !
they won' t believe me if i don' t bring back any proof .
let' s see ...
there !
this cheap , red piece ...
this is it .
this will be a nice gift for my mom in alabama .
please hurry .
madam !
madam ...
telephone . please .
he' s still alive .
please use the phone at the front desk .
marco , is this you ?
are you hurt ?
i was about to leave to pick you up .
yes ...
that' s great .
i lost some weight , because i was stranded on an island .
i' m going to milan to repair my plane .
if that american stops by your hotel , tell him ...
see you again next time .
what ?
do you think i' m a bulletin board or something ?
however much i' m worried about you guys ...
pilots like you regard women as nails in a landing pier or something insignificant .
marco , you' re going to end up as roast pork someday .
i' d hate to witness such a miserable funeral .
a pig who doesn' t fly is just an ordinary pig .
idiot .
i' ve been waiting for you ; i expected you tonight .
i need your help again .
you lost too much this time .
why don' t you just build another one ?
i want to keep this one .
i know how you feel .
step aside , please .
i need drive into the factory .
who' s the cute girl ?
my granddaughter , from america .
all right .
all right .
all right .
nice plane .
it' s neat , grandpa .
good design .
these days there' re almost no workers to do a job like this .
she doesn' t resemble you .
is she really your granddaughter ?
don' t touch her !
fio , i leave this to you .
ok .
i' il do it .
my opponent is curtis .
i need 15 knots more .
curtis ?
i' ve hear of him .
what do you think ?
this is a hallvolley , isn' t it .
don' t ask how i got this .
an italian plane with this engine lost to curtis at the schneider' s cup race in 1927 .
but it lost due to poor engineering , not this engine .
this is exciting .
don' t tune it up too delicately .
my plane isn' t for racing .
are you preaching to me ?
do you know the saying , " preaching a sermon to buddha . ?
are you going to take all of my money ?
these days , wads of bills aren' t worth a damn .
give me the money in your pocket , for propeller and paint ...
this is for living expenses , such as hotel and meals .
you can stay here .
i won' t charge you much .
meals included .
i don' t see your sons .
are they all right ?
all three left to look for work .
then ... who is going to design my plane ?
fio is .
fio !
that little girl i just saw ?
she is young , but she' s got something my sons lack .
look , old man , we' ve known each other for long time .
but i' il look for another repairman this time .
hold it .
are you worried because i' m a woman ?
or , do you think i' m too young to do it ?
both , miss .
ok .
i agree with you .
well , can you tell me the first priority of being a good pilot ?
experience ?
no , inspiration , i think .
well , i' m glad you didn' t say " experience .
anyway , i heard from grandpa that you flew at an early age .
and you' ve been an excellent pilot since then .
that was 1910 , when i was 17 .
17 !
that' s the same age i am now .
i can' t quit being a woman ...
but let me do the job , will you ?
if i don' t do it well , don' t pay me .
ok , grandpa ?
she' s my granddaughter , she' il do well .
in my case , i was able to fix engines at the age of 12 .
could you sleep here tonight ?
i' il make your bed tomorrow .
breakfast' s at 7 : 00am .
you can take a hot shower .
i' ve you left a towel already .
have a good night .
you don' t have enough money .
we know each other well , so will make the rest a loan .
good morning .
did you sleep well ?
did you stay up all night ?
this is the rough plan .
what do you think ?
i want to redesign this wing section , leaving the plane shape as it is .
this will make your plane fly faster .
five knots faster , i think .
i' m surprised at the original plan .
the wing was also made of wood .
this plane is great .
whoever designed this wing must have known the wood very well .
i' m really impressed .
this is the only plane of its kind made .
the designer said this plane was too dangerous to fly .
so nobody used it .
no wonder !
i' m surprised that this radical design lets you to take off from water .
only take offs and landings give me some difficulty .
it behaves strange during the flight .
there' s a 5 degree angle to the wings here , right ?
everything should be fine then .
you' il let me continue with this , then ?
thank you .
i' il do my best !
but let me tell you something , miss .
don' t stay up all night .
you can' t do a good job without sleep .
and it is not good for your beauty .
thank you for your advice .
well , to be honest , i couldn' t sleep well last night , ... because i was very nervous .
i was worried that you won' t let me do this job .
well , i' m very sleepy now .
i' il make some coffee for you .
is she going to build this plane by herself ?
next is my niece , monica , in charge of general construction .
nice to meet you .
this is my nephew' s wife , silvana , to do finishing construction .
these are daughters of my relatives .
sophia , laura , constance , valentina .
this is fio' s elder sister , giliora .
this is sandra , my cousin .
you look so pretty , marietta .
maria , tina , anna , and her younger sister , birreta .
angelino !
grandma !
are you still alive ?
you' ve grown up to be such a nice boy !
are you ladies going to work ?
yes , i' d like to have some money for my great grandchildren .
there are no men here , right ?
yup .
these are all relatives of yours ?
yes , they don' t have any jobs these days .
all the men went elsewhere to work .
because of the " great depression ?
don' t worry .
girls are nice , they work hand , and they' re also gutsy .
building an airplane isn' t like cooking pancakes .
dear god in heaven ...
you gave my company , which was about to go bankrupt , ... a piece of bread and a job .
please forgive us , who make a fighter plane with ladies .
well , let' s eat well and work hard !
sounds good !
this engine is really something !
what do you say , it' s nice , isn' t it ?
don' t over do it , or this factory will be gone .
you don' t think curtis is worth it ?
sure , this is a good idea .
so , let me do it .
but , this is going to cost a fortune .
i got a lot of bills already .
i' m not sure what the sponsor thinks .
porco ...
ok .
don' t look at me like that .
do it your way .
all right !
i' ve already talked to manufacturers .
i' il order these immediately .
porco , i love you !
it' s going to take at least 3 months .
i want to change my job and become an air pirate .
she is a nice girl , isn' t she .
don' t touch her .
i wouldn' t be happy being henpecked .
so , you' re a major ?
you' ve moved up in the world , fierrali .
you , fool .
why did you come back ?
i make it a rule to go wherever i want to .
the government won' t let you go this time .
were you followed ?
i gave them the slip .
they' il issue a warrant for your arrest . anti fascism ... illegal entries ... corrupt ideology ... being a shameless , lazy pig , ... and public indecency .
idiot , this is no laughing matter .
they say they' il confiscate your plane .
this movie is crap , don' t you think .
look , marco , come back to the air force .
i would make room for you .
i' d rather be a pig than a fascist .
the era of sky adventures is over .
the only thing left for us to do is to fly for such ridiculous reasons as the " country .
i' ve lived my life my way , without relying on force .
you are a pig after all , huh ?
thanks for your advice , fierrali .
give my regards to the others .
this is a nice film , don' t you think .
take care .
they don' t sue pigs , but ...
yeah .
goodbye , my comrade .
porco , need a ride ?
hey , you' re a life saver .
i borrowed this to take your plane to the lake tomorrow .
it' s for a test flight .
i don' t need the test flight .
i need to fly as soon as possible .
don' t be stupid .
i' m not going to give you the plane without testing it .
besides , it will take almost a day to take it apart and transport it to the lake .
we don' t have that much time .
take a look back , will you , ... slowly .
that' s the fascists ' secret police .
they were following you , fio .
me ?
why ?
because i gave them the slip .
and , because you are working on my plane .
hey , porco , are you really a spy ?
me ?
a spy ?
look , a spy works a lot harder than i do .
but , you were a hero in the war .
this is strange if you didn' t do anything .
i think so , too .
this isn' t the right way !
looks like you' re used to being in big trouble .
well , we' il be very busy .
you can take off anytime you want .
two guys are hiding in the backyard , ... and three in the front .
this is so exciting !
hey , grandma , don' t ramble .
see you later .
take care of yourself .
thank you .
fio !
what are you doing ?
i' m going , too .
hang on 5 minutes while i prepare my seat .
quit fooling around .
do you understand what you are saying ?
shh ...
don' t talk so loud .
fio .
listen .
you' re the daughter of a decent man .
besides , you' re not married yet .
then ...
hold this for a moment .
thanks .
i made this in a hurry .
see ?
this really fits .
would you hold that ?
look , miss .
i' m a bounty hunter wanted by the government .
i' m not going to be playing with this plane .
i' m sorry , but i have responsibility for this plane .
but , i' m going to take off from the canal out back .
and i' m not even sure if it can fly .
all the more reason i should go with you .
and , if you' re going to fight curtis ... you' il need a good mechanic , won' t you ?
look , i' m a man , you know .
we' re going to be camping alone on a deserted island .
i don' t care , i like camping .
that' s not what i meant .
take her with you .
i want you to beat curtis so you can repay the loan .
my company may go bankrupt if you don' t pay it .
are you really her grandfather ?
you don' t have to pay her .
plus , i' m going to install this phone for you two .
you really want her to be wanted by the police ?
no .
i' m going to be porco' s hostage .
that way they can excuse their cooperation with you .
so , please , take me with you .
i won' t give you any trouble .
take off the machine gun on the right side .
what ?
there' s almost no space , even if you' ve got a small butt .
take off one machine gun !
great !
my butt is bigger then it looks .
it will be just take a minute .
i want to take off as soon as possible .
before the old ladies say they want to come with me too .
oh , that' s a nice idea .
grandma , come on , hurry .
fio .
you don' t have get me a souvenir .
contact .
open the door !
let it go !
how is the steering , porco ?
kind of like a tomboy , just like you .
it' s beginning to go wild .
stop the plane at once !
we' il make adjustments !
we don' t have the time to do it .
just do your job .
ship dead ahead !
let' s fly !
easy , tomboy !
the turning wing is shifting to the right .
use the tab !
the tab ?
the new one i put in !
hurry !
good .
it became a nice boy all of a sudden .
beautiful .
the world' s really beautiful .
is he following us ?
no .
he' s not attacking .
that' s a parade plane of the italian air force .
looks like it' s fierrali ...
do you know him ?
the air force lies in wait up ahead .
he says he' il show us how to avoid them .
he also says that we should fly low to the adriatic sea .
thanks , comrade !
thanks !
he told you , " don' t cast pearls before a swine .
you' re lovely .
you look like a rose blooming in a secret flower garden .
you , bastard !
this is private garden .
i really want you to look at this .
oh , this is from hollywood .
about the production of the story and casting you sent ,
please contact us as soon as possible ; we are in the middle of preliminary trials .
the title is , " a bouquet of the adriatic sea .
that' s nice .
really ?
that means o. k. , then ?
gina , come to hollywood with me .
i only worked for the pirates to gain fame and fortune .
next , i want to be a hollywood star .
and , then ?
the president !
i' m serious .
i promise to make you the first lady .
gina .
i like you for such foolishness .
really ! ?
but i must say no , because i already have a gamble going .
when i' m in this garden , if he comes over here , ...
i will love him .
but he comes only to the restaurant at night .
and never emerges in the daylight .
he' s come back .
fool .
he left without landing the plane .
i lost the gamble again .
you' re kidding !
the gamble is about him ?
is that a problem ?
life is more complicated here than in your country .
here i can fall in love anytime i want .
kid , go to hollywood by yourself , ok ?
kid ... ?
i hit my head because you did an acrobatic maneuver all of a sudden .
i just said hello to my friend .
to gina of the hotel adriano ?
that was her in the white dress on the hotel terrace , wasn' t it ?
my grandpa told me that every pilot in the adriatic sea falls in love with gina .
you speculate a lot .
so , what' s the lady like ?
you fell in love with her too , didn' t you , porco ?
we' re going down to refuel .
close your mouth , or you' il bite your tongue .
w wait !
a girl on a fighter ?
where' s porco ?
he is talking with my dad .
not only the temporary government ... but also the royalist faction ...
they' ve tried to get along with the air pirates .
fighting against the air pirates is not a thing to do .
here you are .
thanks .
no thanks for such bad news .
what ?
you should offer yourself to one side or the other .
they' il pay a fortune for your skill .
you got a cigarette ?
curtis will go back to america sooner or later .
we' re the ones who should to go to america .
goodbye to freedom in the adriatic sea .
is that byron ?
no , it' s me .
see you later .
later .
porco , this is awful .
the gas price is three times as much as in italy .
we' re not in luck .
don' t be like a businessman , make it cheaper .
this gas is genuine .
that' s why i hate women .
hey , would you explain it to her ...
pay him , fio .
then put your big butt back in the space between the machine guns .
we' re going to fly to my home .
i' il add the gas bill to your account .
nobody can live alone .
we rely on each other .
nobody lives around here , ... even though the landscape is beautiful .
here we are .
that island is my home .
beautiful !
what a wonderful place .
my legs are stiff from the long flight .
don' t move !
they' re stinking up the place again .
boss , we caught him !
boss !
damn !
don' t step on me ...
back off !
i was waiting for you , pig !
i knew you' d be coming here .
you gave us a lot of trouble .
it' s a girl .
the pig is with a girl .
she' s cute .
shut up !
so what if it' s a girl ?
about a half of the world' s population are women !
hey , that' s no ordinary girl .
she is a chief engineer at the piccolo company .
but , she' s so young and pretty .
that girl ?
really ?
she made my plane much better then before .
she may be young , ... but she' s really something .
you mean it , porco ?
you' re good with airplanes in general .
be polite , boys .
she came with me to collect my debts .
you' re deep in debt after all .
it serves you right !
hey !
let' s break his poor red plane , and leave him his debt !
break ?
are you going to break the plane i made ?
are you going to break such beautiful airplane with axes ?
miss , there' s a complicated reason behind this .
you are going to break it !
well , that is ...
are you guys really seaplane pilots ?
would you step back ?
my shoes .
i' ve grown up with a lot of stories about pilots since i was a small child .
my grandpa always told me that no one is as nice as sea pilots .
grandpa said it' s because sea and sky purify their hearts .
hence , sea pilots are much braver then sailors , ... and prouder than the ordinary pilots .
don' t tell me .
i know that .
they' re the pilots .
what they value most , he said , is neither money nor women , ... but honor .
yes , you' re right !
yes , lady !
a toast to the sea pilots !
she' s really something .
i understand .
i won' t smash the plane you made with axes .
but we' il be mortified if we don' t do anything .
let' s lynch the pig !
yeah !
lynch the pig !
what the hell you talking about ?
you guys don' t understand a word i said .
i asked whether you feel ashamed or not .
aren' t you ashamed that you need the help of that american , curtis ?
if your mother heard of that , she would cry .
what the hell are you saying , you don' t even take a shower .
porco came back to fight curtis , ... for the pride and honor of the pilots of the adriatic .
you guys are lowest of the low !
fight with dignity !
i told you not to hire curtis , eh !
that' s not fair .
don' t try to excuse yourself .
boss , what are we supposed to do ?
she convinced us .
how about asking curtis to fight the pig ?
do we ask him to fight the pig , again ?
the contract is already over .
i' m so ashamed ...
that' s curtis !
i heard that .
i' m not going to run away !
you guys are crazy , coming down here like that .
hey , hold this .
you want a re match , don' t you .
but i won once , already .
besides , i' m not a bounty hunter for these guys anymore .
you mean you won' t fight for nothing ?
what' s your proposition ?
beautiful !
will you marry me if i win ?
i' m serious .
o. k. and if porco wins , you' il pay these bills .
wait , fio !
stay out of this !
fio , you still have time to think about that .
ask him , not me .
this is very expensive .
it' s very cheap .
are you going to fight or not ?
i' m willing to fight for love .
all right !
listen up everybody .
i' m really impressed with miss fio' s decision .
we , " mamma aiuto " , are going to sponsor fight !
let the air pirates union do this , too !
fio !
see you soon !
this stinks !
hey pig , don' t run away !
shut up !
get lost !
bye !
this is ridiculous .
well , you are ...
don' t tell me .
i know , i was foolish .
fio ...
i think i have to thank you .
you gave me my chance .
thanks .
we share the same luck .
we are partners , aren' t we ?
we are going to have a hard time .
i trust you , porco .
trust me , eh ?
i haven' t heard that in a long time , but i' m glad you said that .
what' s wrong ?
you feel sick ?
fio ...
i' m fine .
it' s just that my heart is pounding .
my knees are shaking .
to be honest , i was really scared .
i want to swim .
porco !
i made a big mistake !
what' s wrong ?
i should have padded the deal .
we made a bad bargain .
you' re right .
porco ....
having trouble sleeping ?
just now ...
it must have been a dream .
everything is all right .
it' s too early to get up .
porco ...
why did you become a pig ?
don' t know .
i' ve heard a lot about captain marco pabatto .
my father used to be in the same unit .
i' ve heard many a story , ... about how the captain saved the live of enemy pilots .
i liked it .
porco !
how about if i kiss you ?
you know , like a fairy tale where a princess breaks a curse on a prince who was changed into a frog .
silly girl .
save it for your first love !
won' t my kiss work ?
you' re a nice kid .
you make me feel comfortable and make me wish i was a human being again .
now be a nice girl and go to sleep .
tell me your story and i will .
my story ?
well ...
it was the last summer of the war .
we were flying on our usual patrol , ... heading over the adriatic sea to istria .
belneldi was flying on my right wing .
he was an old friend of mine .
he got married just two days before .
i was the matchmaker .
he didn' t have enough leave to be with his wife for long .
so , he returned to duty .
everyone was falling like flies , friend and foe alike .
i was being chased by three planes , ... and had no time to worry about my friend .
in the end , i was the only one left from my unit .
but , they never gave up chasing me .
i made desperate efforts to run away .
my hands and feet went numb , and i grew dizzy .
i thought i was going to die .
that was when i saw the white sky .
white sky ?
yeah .
it was like a flash .
it was so bright , it took me a while to realize that i was in a cloud .
i was worn out , ... and didn' t have any power left to control my plane .
in spite of that , ... my plane continued to fly .
a cloud of planes ...
yeah
it was calm .
the sky was very clear , too clear .
there was a line of clouds far above me .
belneldi , you' re alive ?
belneldi , wait !
where are you going ?
belneldi , don' t go !
are you going to leave gina alone ?
i' il go instead of you !
when i came to , ...
i was flying alone over the sea , almost touching it .
god said it wasn' t your time yet , didn' t he ?
in my mind , i thought he might let me fly like that forever .
that would not have been right !
you' re a good guy !
the good guys are all dead already .
besides , that might have been hell inside that cloud .
well , that' s the end of my story .
now go to sleep .
shit , they gave me crap ...
i' m glad you came back to live , ... because i like you .
good night !
hey , hey , ...
which one' s gonna win ... a pig ...
place yer ...
fools .
they make our fight into a festival .
are they all air pirates ?
the scum of the mediterranean ... gangs , ... pirates , smugglers , ... spies , ... and even a few ordinary people .
this' il make me even more famous .
ten minutes' til start .
ten minutes' til start .
all right !
this is a fight between porco rosso and donald curtis !
there are no special rules , ... but any unfair tricks will be a disgrace to their fans .
shut up and get started .
get on with it .
shut up !
or i' il kill you all !
he' d be better off dropping a 10 ton bomb .
this fight will determine the future of miss fio piccolo .
so shut up .
do you understand ?
now let' s have some applause !
clap !
let' s get going .
shut up
this is a formality .
well , both of you present your stakes .
have a seat .
thanks .
put it on the chair properly !
none of you have anything to say ?
well shake hands or something before you start !
no way .
i' m fond of cleanliness .
he' s hard to please .
fio , as soon as this fight is over , we will go to the church .
don' t worry .
my mom told me you' re going to like me soon .
may i take a picture with you ?
everybody , smile !
smlle !
yes .
the flight' il be over in 3 minutes .
the black plane has the advantage ...
the black plane has the advantage ...
this is great .
i wish they' d do this every month
15 seconds to go .

curtis took over !
this is going to be a one sided fight .
give me that .
porco , what are you doing ?
pull up !
he' d be shot if the climbed now .
it' s very difficult for curtis to shoot porco in this situation .
i know you want me to waste ammo .
looping !
the pig took curtis ' back !
looping ?
that skill made the pig the ace of the adriatic sea .
dammit !
he' s gonna shoot !
why doesn' t he open fire ?
is his machine gun broken ! ?
i got it .
the pig won' t shoot until the end .
what ?
the pig doesn' t kill anybody .
for now , the american should be fine .
you got it !
shoot !
oh , he didn' t shoot yet ....
see , i told you .
if the pig opened fire , it would kill the american .
so , he' s going to hit curtis ' engine with a few bullets after curtis gets tired .
he said this is not war , but ...
porco ...
are you teasing me or what ?
come on !
is your machine gun broken ?
you poor bastard !
they are coming this way !
you' re teasing me .
come on , pig !
go away !
fight somewhere else !
great !
the pig is leaving a cloud trail .
i' ve never seen such an air fight before .
i' m really impressed .
i' m ready for takeoff .
she' d better hurry , or the fight will be over .
she' s in her room , and won' t come out .
does she want to go or not ?
i want to see that fight myself ...
to g of hearts , for the pig .
the air force found out about the fight .
stop the silly fight .
f ?
must be from fierrali .
i' d better hurry .
both of them are very tough .
the show isn' t over yet !
porco , hang in there !
i' m not going to give fio to a man like you .
o. k. the pig took curtis' s tail .
it' s all over !
ooops .
jammed ?
you' re finished .
ooops .
jammed , too .
you idiot !
you' re finally out of ammo !
this is broken because of fio' s butt .
i' m not going to let this fight end in a draw .
this isn' t a western .
you can' t hit me .
you ...
you really think it will reach this far ?
you , stinking pig !
looks like something' s wrong .
ah ... they' re coming in .
they' re coming back !
wait !
the stakes can' t leave here .
o. k. wait , you guys .
you fat pig !
you chicken cowboy !
come on , bare hands !
go back to the cows !
porco , hold on !
stand up , pig .
go , go !
all bets still stand !
where' s the betting table ?
can' t you fly any faster ?
it' s impossible .
the engine would blow .
pilots are all stupid , aren' t they ...
hey , fio .
did you see my punch ?
i' m gonna take him down next round .
i' il take you down this time .
porco , hang on !
i' il make prosciutto out of you !
come on , you chicken !
you are the chicken !
you seduce all women around you .
choose gina or fio , one or the other .
what ?
you can' t have both .
gina is ...
gina ?
leave gina out of this !
gina loves you , pig .
she is ... ... waiting for you ... ... in the garden !
porco !
the gong !
count him out !
but ...
look at that !
i can see it .
the italian air force hasn' t arrived yet .
you are unfair ...
you' re a dirty liar .
don' t you understand , you idiot .
i' m not lying ...
i won' t give fio to you .
that' s gina' s plane .
it' s an emergency signal .
the winner is whoever stands up first .
everybody , let me through .
gina , don' t .
marco .
marco , can you hear me ?
do you want another girl to be unhappy ?
porco !
porco !
porco , thank you !
nothing to it .
this party is over .
the italian air force will be here any minute .
everybody get out of here quickly , please .
then stop by my restaurant .
i will serve you all .
everybody , let' s go !
it' s all over .
hey , boss , come on !
hurry up !
shut up !
this is the ceremony .
i don' t like the pig , but i like you .
be a nice lady engineer .
goodbye !
thank you .
take a shower sometime , will you ?
thank you , too , mr. curtis .
next time i' il propose to you formally , not as a bet .
o. k.
but i' ve made up my mind already .
you' re getting on gina' s plane .
no !
no !
no .
i' m going on porco' s plane .
you said i' m your partner , didn' t you .
gina .
take her home , please .
you always do this .
i' m sorry .
you better go .
let' s go .
the italian air force is finally here .
do you want to help me ?
i' m going to lead them off .
your face !
wait !
hey !
let me see your face !
that' s your plane is over there .
just a peek !
after the flight from the italian air force , ...
i returned to milan .
i haven' t seen porco since .
instead , i' ve found a very good friend in miss gina .
since the day of the fight , there have been many wars .
but i still keep in touch with gina .
after i took over the piccolo factory ,
i make it a rule to spend summer vacations at the hotel adriano .
miss gina has become more beautiful each year .
old friends still stop by the hotel all the time .
oh , yeah , ...
although he is not the president of the u. s. yet , ...
mr. curtis writes to me sometimes .
he says he longs for the summer of the adriatic sea .
it' s a secret between me and gina that she won her gamble .
