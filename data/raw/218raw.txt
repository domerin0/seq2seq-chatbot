your favorite simulation .
just killing time .
you want to spar ?
as you wish .
that was too easy .
what' s the problem ?
where' s your concentration ?
maybe you regret taking the red pill .
maybe .
it crosses everyone' s mind at least once .
the wish to return to an ordinary life .
a carefree life in the country .
the life we had before knowing all this .
even if that life was just an illusion ?
it' s ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world .
finally starting to warm up .
listen to me .
i have something i want to talk to you about .
it' s all right .
i' ve blocked the signal so no one else can hear us .
so , what ?
you gonna propose ?
i' m going back to the matrix and i want you to come with me .
come on , be serious , duo .
stop teasing me .
i am serious , and you know it .
i really thought you' d be with me on this .
anyway , it' s done and it' s all been settled with them .
what do you mean , it' s all been settled ?
this is the only way .
it' s just a matter of time before zion is wiped out .
come with me .
stop it .
please do not do this to me , duo .
we can' t .
we can !
i' ve come to my senses .
you should do the same .
i took the red pill because i wanted to know the truth .
but i don' t care about the truth anymore .
what' s real doesn' t matter .
what' s important is how we live our lives .
are you listening to me ?
you know i' m right .
but we can' t go back , duo .
we know the truth now .
we can forget all of this .
duo ...
i know how .
trust me .
don' t be afraid to look into your heart .
say what you' re really feeling .
tell me .
i can' t .
i don' t know .
running away won' t change anything !
you' re the one that' s running away !
stop pretending !
enough , duo .
i' ve had enough !
there' s no time .
they' re on their way .
you betrayed us , didn' t you ?
operator , please !
get me out of here right now .
operator , i need an exit !
it' s no use .
i told you .
i' ve blocked your signal .
you won' t stop me .
this is your last chance .
the choice isn' t that hard .
come with me .
you can forget about it , duo .
i won' t look away from the truth .
i can' t .
that' s too bad .
i' m sorry .
i wanted to go back with you .
i love you .
no !
relax , you' re okay .
easy , cis , settle down .
he was just part of the training program .
he' s just a simulation .
it' s over .
it was a test .
judgment .
concentration .
technique .
high scores on everything .
now , get some rest .
you okay ?
i feel a lot better now .
except for that last part ... ... i' d say she passed .
