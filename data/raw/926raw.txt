well , you were right .
delauer diamonds is looking for a new ad agency .
warren wants to move on it aggressively .
yes !
oh , oh , this is a good day , this is a good day .
guys , did you know that diamonds are about as common as taxis on fifth avenue ?
the value is entirely sentimental , maintained by a supply , demand and advertising .
stripes .
now , delauer dominates the world diamond market .
meaning if i represent them ,
i basically represent the entire industry .
tell him .
what ?
warren gave it to the judys .
spears and green they' re already on it .
no way !
yeah , well , you know , he' s kind of partial to hot , leggy chicks for some reason .
yeah , and we' re the , you know , the sneakers and beer division .
precious gems aren' t exactly our forte .
lips and hips are over at a chick' s magazine right now .
i got to get to warren before they sink ...
you can' t , you can' t .
he' s on a plane .
easy , pal .
the chicago meeting .
and it' s too late anyway , because warren' s meeting them for drinks at mullins ' tonight to discuss their ideas .
you know what ?
this isn' t happening .
you know why ?
this was my tip .
it' s going to be my pitch , my account , my campaign .
this is my baby .
that' s what i' m talking about .
they will not ace me out of this .
that' s right .
i heard that .
okay .
mullins ' , tonight .
i heard that " ?
oh .
hi .
hi .
l i don' t really want to talk about it , okay ?
okay .
okay .
okay .
why does this always happen to me ?
things were going great for , like , a week and a half , and then , all of a sudden , it' s over , and i am mystified .
seriously , i am mystified , because it always starts out so well .
poor baby .
let' s just roll with this one .
oh , mike and i had such a connection .
the first time that we had sex , ... it was so beautiful ...
i cried .
you cried ?
yeah .
you mean , like , one glistening tear on your cheek , right ?
no .
i was really emotional .
i even told him that i loved him .
after how many days ?
five .
two .
it was how i felt .
i wanted to express myself .
okay , well , what did he say ?
oh , mike didn' t have to say anything .
i know that he felt the same .
but then he started getting really busy , and i didn' t know where he was .
so i kept calling him and calling him .
he was never home ...
you kept calling him ?
i didn' t leave a message .
he didn' t know it was me .
my number' s blocked .
oh , l i' m sure he thought it was one of his friends .
you know , men frequently call their friends ' answering machines and hang up 20 times .
anyway ...
i' m too fat .
you' re not fat !
you' re not fat !
oh , michelle , if the most beautiful woman in the world acted the way you did , any normal guy would still go running in the other direction .
oh , no .
no guy would go running from you , andie .
you could barf all over him , and he would say , " do it again .
that is both incredibly disgusting and categorically untrue .
lf i did the things you did , i' d get dumped , too .
okay , family , shoes off .
and breathe .
out .
okay , lori , let' s start with you .
well , the " botox for beginners " piece is done .
now , it' s a little scary , but mostly upbeat .
now i' m on
what your gyno won' t tell you , " which is also pretty scary , but , you know , upbeat .
i finished my research on deadly pedicures , about the woman who contracted that fungus from the unsterilized tools .
yeah .
it' s a terrible story .
although , surprisingly ... upbeat !
marvelous .
what' s next for " ' how to ' with andie " ?
well , i' ve been working on something that' s kind of different .
it' s ...
it' s a political piece , and it' s ...
no .
andie , you work at composure magazine .
we are fashion , trends , diets , cosmetic surgeries , salacious gossip that' s composure .
okay , but ...
look ,
andie , okay the column is new for you .
when you turn it into a must read , then you can write about whatever you want .
until then , you can write about whatever i want .
understood ?
yeah .
michelle , what have you got ?
i' m sorry , lana ,
i wasn' t feeling very well ...
she got dumped .
oh , no ,
michelle ...
what a hellish ordeal for you .
but i must say , you are looking fabulous .
are we loving the way she looks , all ?
we love the way she looks .
oh , you are so right .
she looks great .
well , i haven' t eaten since the split .
good for you !
write about it .
i can' t use my personal life for a story .
i understand completely .
who will use michelle' s personal life for a story ?
oh , i will .
go .
no , no , no ,
lana , with all due respect ,
lori has no business mucking around in my personal life , and i can' t ...
i can' t let her .
i am ...
i' il do it .
what ?
i' il ...
i will ...
i' il sort of do it .
it' s ...
you will be my inspiration .
for ?
look at michelle .
she is a great girl , right ?
yes .
an amazing woman .
but she has a problem hanging onto relationships , and doesn' t really know what she' s doing wrong , which is like a lot of our readers .
uh huh .
so , i was thinking that i could start by dating a guy , and then drive him away , but only using the classic mistakes most women , like michelle , make ... all the time .
i' il keep a diary of it , and it will be sort of a ... dating " how to " in reverse .
what not to do .
yeah .
how to lose a guy in ten days .
yes .
go .
bart , what' s new in the shoe world ?
wait , wait , lana , i' m sorry .
why ten days ?
five days is too short , and we go to press in 1 1 .
yes ?
okay , what we found out is men are attracted to purple shoes .
now , i love ...
maybe toss in something spiritual as well .
who' s that chic buddhist richard gere cavorts with ?
the dalai lama .
he' s fabulous .
ah !
here' s my 10 : 00 .
welcome .
hi .
ladies , judy spears and judy green from warren advertising .

jeannie ashcroft , fashion and trends .
michelle rubin , fitness and health .
excuse me .
hi .
and andie anderson , our resident " how to " girl .
oh , i' ve seen your column , andie .
what are you working on now ?
oh , actually ...
how to lose a guy in ten days .
she' s actually going to start dating a guy , and then drive him away in a week and a half .
sounds needlessly vicious .
it' s going to be fabulous .
now all she has to do is run along and find the lucky guy .
go , go , go .
nice to meet you .
bye .
good bye .
ladies , come .
find the guy .
okay .
find the guy .
oh , you are never going to pull this off .
watch me .
tonight , i' il hook a guy .
tomorrow , pull the switch .
before the ten days are up ,
i' m going to have this guy running for his life .
you' re not going to burn his apartment down or bite him or anything , are you ?
no !
i' m going to limit myself to doing everything girls do wrong in relationships .
basically , everything we know guys hate .
i' il be clingy , needy ...
yeah .
be touchy feely .
ooh , call him in the middle of the night , and tell him everything you had to eat that day .
what' s wrong with that ?
i' m kidding .
hello , ben .
what are you doing here ?
phil , i' m here for the meeting .
ladies .
but you weren' t invited .
yeah , but i should have been .
i mean , it was my tip that delauer' s shopping for a new firm .
yes , it was , but i have to think in terms of who' s best suited within the company team .
yes , sir , and that' s me .
i want to handle this pitch .
ben , you sell joe blow better than anyone else in my shop , but these girls sell luxury better than anyone else in the business .
we have to put our best foot forward on this pitch .
delauer would be our biggest account .
yes , sir , they would .
annual advertising billings of 50 to $60 million .
and i am the man that' s going to bring this home for you , phil .
why this place ?
it' s perfect .
hi , lngrid .
hi .
mullins ' is the apres work watering hole for the upwardly mobile .
now , to date , the diamond industry has always targeted men , sending the message that the woman needs the man to buy her the rock .
all right , they say , " a diamond is forever .
we say , " a diamond is for everyone .
i like that .
yes .
we don' t .
a diamond is for everyone " sends the message that diamonds are everywhere , which means they' re not rare , and if they' re not rare , they lose their status .
status is the reason to buy them in the first place , which benjamin would know if he understood women , which you don' t .
you can' t feel bad about that , ben .
no man does .
here you go .
thank you .
thanks .
oh !
sorry .
here .
here .
thanks .
dum , dum , dum , dum , dum , dum , dum ...
hey , don' t pressure her .
she' s perusing .
yes , exactly .
hmm .
hmm .
selling a diamond to a woman is like making her fall in love .
she has to feel giddy , desirous , adventurous , and desperate .
take a look around this room , phillip .
most of the women in this bar are looking for just that .
exactly .
the skills required to market diamonds are the same as those needed to make a woman fall in love , yes .
i' m not talking about lust .
a woman in lust wants chocolate .
a woman in love ... wants diamonds .
yeah , i' m not talking about lust , either , ladies .
i' m talking about deep , meaningful , head over heels , his and her towels ,
let' s grow old together , l o v e.
look , i love women .
i do .
whether they' re four , 40 , or my 88 year old grandmother ,
i respect women , all right ?
and i also listen ... to women , and that' s why i can sell myself to any woman , anywhere , anytime .
make a woman fall in love with diamonds , benjamin ... or with you ?
eh , either one .
well , that' s cocky , ben .
no , not cocky confident .
i' d like to see you prove that .
you would ?
the agency' s cohosting a party for the delauers at the astor museum .
the party' s a week from sunday .
do you think you could make a woman fall in love with you by then ?
ten days ?
any woman , anywhere , anytime ?
any single , available , straight woman yes .
yes .
i' m not trying to trick you , ben .
ln fact , we' il choose a woman right here , right now , in this bar , and then you decide .
ooh .
so , who' s the lucky girl ?
okay ...
let' s see here .
ooh , there' s that blonde babe in the leopard print .
whoa , ho , ho !
she looks like fun .
be nice , ladies .
or ... wow ,
miss babylon five .
now , she' s on the prowl .

but here are the stakes .
after i win this bet , this pitch is mine .
agreed .
phil ?
agreed .
you come to that party with a girl that' s really in love with you , ben ... you can make the pitch to the delauers .

oh , you are already falling in love with me .
i' m going to make you wish you were dead .
poor guy .
of all the women spears and green could have thrown at me , this one is amazing .
hanging with her for ten days is going to be no problem .
right , so , it' s only nine days longer than you' ve ever spent with any other chick , huh ?
that' s why i didn' t go for the gold immediately .
oh .
i' m taking my time .
it' s a marathon , not a sprint .
ten days is a marathon ?
okay , so it' s more like the 3, 000 meter hurdle .
the point is , she' s already on the ropes , guys .
wow , that that' s a lot of sports analogies .
that it ?
that that' s it ?
that' s it .
have you looked inside ?
no .
do you have an ethical problem with rifling through a woman' s purse ?
uh , yeah , i guess i do .
well , it' s hardly a purse , dude .
it' s more like a clutch or something .
guys , a woman' s purse , all right it' s her secret source of power .
all right ?
there there are many dark and dangerous things in there that we , the male species , should know nothing about .
oh .
unless , of course , she , uh , left it behind intentionally to secure a next day call back .
mm hmm .
she' s a very clever minx .
oops , i' m sorry .
oh , god .
um ...
oh , shit , we got to clean that up .
yeah , yeah .
carefully .
carefully .
oh , what have we here ?
let us see , let us see .
oh ...
knicks tickets ...
huh . ... for tonight' s game .
delivery , andie .
wow , look at those !
oh , who are those for ?
andie , oh , my god !
where do you want these ?
who are these to ?
wait .
100 times ...
... more beautiful ...
wait . " ... than 100 roses .
catchy .
the guy' s in advertising .
he can' t help it .
so , does this mean he' s hooked ?
this means he found the knicks tickets .
you left the tickets in the purse ?
yeah .
you are just on a whole different playing field .
here you go .
mm hmm .
andie anderson .
hey , hey , pretty girl .
guess what ?
i got a really embarrassing display of white roses .
well , you are welcome .

i have your bag .
ah , i know .
i can' t believe i left it there .
yeah , well , you must need it back , what with all the cash , credit cards , and ... those knicks tickets for tonight' s game .
sounds like you' ve been peeking through my bag , ben .
oh , absolutely not .
tony , my art director , he' s an oaf , and he accidentally knocked it over .
ow , right !
yeah , i' m a clumsy man .
all right , i' m sorry , though .
i' m going to the game with somebody else .
not anymore .
besides , what ?
you think you left your purse at my place by accident ?
no .
subconsciously , you are dying to take me to that game .
denying your subconscious desires is extremely dangerous to your health , young lady .
