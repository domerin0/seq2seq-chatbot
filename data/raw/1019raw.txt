hike !
martel !
martel , you' re a wimp !
i can' t believe that martel goes for a give up slide
it did look cautious i could have scored on that !
it may be the lastplay of the season .
the player' s strike became official . .. ... at 4 p . m .
eastern time .
i' m sad that the players ' demands , which center around . .. ... a rise in the current salary cap , were rejected by the owners .
i have told my union brothers to walk .
get me jimmy mcginty !
have him here tonight yes , sir
i' m here with eddie martel .
a lot of angry fans out there feel that the players are being too greedy .
any comments ?
dwight , i know $5 million a year sounds like a lot of money ... ... but i have to pay 10 % to my agent , 5 % to my lawyer
do you know what insurance costs on a ferrari , mother
pat , back to you .
that was washington running back malcolm lamont
it' s all about money , folks , but isn' t it always ?
yes .
this is pat summerall for john madden saying ... ... so long from nextel stadium .
you look like shit i' m dying , jimmy
come on you' ve been dying for 20 years
give me a cigarette i quit
nobody likes a quitter

no
why , you liar
could you believe that slide by martel ?
what a pussy

she had her lips done
i never even knew you could have your lips done
looks like a largemouth bass
i' m too old to screw around let me give it to you straight
i want you back you already have a coach i' il take care of it
like you took care of me now , jimmy your players all flew home to their castles in their private jets
we' re gonna finish the season anyway
i' m gonna use replacement players
jeez , what a business we got 4 games left
we win three , we' re in the playoffs
really ?
win three out of four with replacement players ?
that' s not too much to ask you won for me once , you can do it again
what' s the matter , jimmy ?
nobody' s gonna give you a better chance than this after that dallas mess
i was right about that it had nothing to do with being right !
went head to head with an $8 million quarterback
who did you think was gonna win ?
that' s not gonna happen here !
i' m talking about a team of poor nobodies who play to win
not a bunch of bitchy millionaires
come on , jimmy !
i' m thinking
hello !
hello !
i want total control of my team
i want to be able to recruit anybody that i want , no interference
my word is my bond
i want it in writing
okay , jimmy
okay
we thought we' d skip special teams for now
it' il be tough enough to put together a team in a week
we' re gonna go a different way a different way ?
here' s a list of people i' ve been watching over the years
they' ve all played football , not all of them in the pros
but they all have something unique to bring
we' il take them and try to put together a winning team
if nothing else , they should be fun to watch
daniel bateman , swat team officer
awarded a purple heart for losing a kidney during the gulf war .
a walk on at michigan state before he gave up football ... to sneak back into the service for one more tour of duty .
clifford franklin
great attitude , great desire , and the fastest son of a bitch i' ve ever seen
clifford !
twinkie !
what' s up , man ?
got any twinkies ?
can he catch ?
that' s why i have you
andre and jamal jackson
together , these guys are the best tandem team of guards in the game
you' re kidding me !
andre got traded and they fell apart
he ain' t our problem no more we gonna play football
football ?
football
nigel gruff
striker out of cardiff , now residing in hell' s kitchen .
he' s " the leg " because he can kick a soccer ball the length of the field
gentlemen the drinks are on the house !
bollocks !
pissing away our money again ?

that old coach from the ' 80s
we met just before the sugar bowl
i remember
hell of a game , that sugar bowl

40 points ?
that would be 45
a game like that sticks with you you never shake it off
got 3 concussions to prove it that' s why girls don' t play
why are you here , coach ?
back with the sentinels i want you as quarterback
i found the best guards and a wide receiver even you couldn' t overthrow
i' m retired retired ?
it looks like things have gone real well for you since
i got no complaints
it' s quiet here
nobody bothers me
the great thing about plankton is , it pretty much keeps to itself
you know what separates the winners from the losers ?
the score
getting back up after being kicked in the teeth
i watched films of your games since the sugar bowl you shouldn' t have been trying to carry the whole team that first year your teammates leaned on you and you crumbled
is that how you want to be remembered ?
i don' t want to be remembered at all
if you do well , who knows what' il happen after the strike
i' m not making you any promises , but why don' t you take a chance ?
rather than scraping crap off the bottom of somebody else' s toys ?
think it over
you could be part of something
football fans , what the owners are doing is absolutely unconscionable
they have blatantly hired scabs
which goes against our constitution , the declaration of independence ... ... and the emancipation proclamation .
here come the scabs now !

it' s a good thing you did last night
it was just stupid

how' s that arm ?

what' s that smell ?
wild yam
that' s nice you like that ?
and so , boys and girls , if anybody does have any firearms ... ... you need to turn them in as soon as possible .
no questions asked
understood ?
all right
okay , coach , it' s all yours
last sunday , i saw a team on the field play as hard as they could to win the football game
we lost not because of effort or desire but because of lack of leadership and trust one' s been resolved
but leadership means nothing if we don' t believe in each other
players spend years together before they develop trust
i' m asking you to do it in a week , not reasonable but these aren' t reasonable times
i know you all have concerns about this sunday
but a real man
admits his fears
i' m asking you to do that here , tonight
who wants to start ?
let' s talk about fears
fears fears
i' m scared of spiders , coach
that' s not what i meant i' m afraid of spiders too
goddamn spiders freak me , too , fellas
well , i didn' t mean that
ever get one of those spiders crawling up your arm ?
crawling on you ?
damn !
thanks , jumbo you can just rock me to sleep tonight
okay , that' s great , but i' m talking about what scares us on the field
like spiders on the field ?
can we get beyond the spiders , please ?
bees
bees ?
bees ?
bees
anybody here afraid of anything other than insects ?
come on
quicksand
shit , yeah !
quicksand' s a scary mother , man
it sucks you right in and even if you scream , you get that muck
i don' t think that' s it
that' s not what he had in mind
what' s he talking about , then ?
ask him
what' s up , shane ?
you' re playing and you think everything is going fine but then one thing goes wrong
and another
and another you try to fight back , but the harder you fight , the deeper you sink
until you can' t move you can' t breathe because you' re in over your head
like quicksand
that' s some deep shit some deep shit
anything else ?
going back to the mini mart the shipping yard
the auto plant
prison yeah , all right
the truth is , you guys have been given something that every athlete dreams of
a second chance
and you' re afraid of blowing it
we all are
but now our fear is shared and we can overcome it together
let' s lose that fear this sunday and put it into san diego !
come on !
another vicious hit by the all pro hank morris .
that' s his third of the game .
it' s just me , dickhead
i tell you , he is really putting a hurt on falco .
i' m not sure how much more of this abuse he can take
huddle up !
huddle up !
same play , except let morris by nobody touch him
it' s 16 0 already i said let him through !

touchdown , brian murphy .
everybody in the stadium knows that an onside kick is coming ... ... with 55 seconds left on the clock .
with just 55 seconds left , washington has to recover the ball . .. ... call a time out fast , so gruff will have a shot at a field goal .
big bateman ends up with the ball !
danny , go down !
no one' s gonna tackle him .
he ' s reversing his field !
he forgot the clock' s running out .
well , he' s trying to run out the clock .
danny , go down ! you' re using up the clock !
you won' t see that every day
time out !
time out !
nice hit , shane !
nice hit
what do you think ?
we don' t stop the clock , it' s over
you just hold it , and i' il kick the bloody piss out of it
what the hell ?
what the hell !
field goal !
mcginty' s gonna let gruff try this field goal from 65 yards out !
i don' t know if he has enough leg .
i think he' s smoking on the field
smoking ?
i' m sure you just imagined that .
no , i saw the smoke and everything .
vito !
look who' s on tv !
he wants to keep his pub , he' s gonna stop blowing some kicks !
i' m telling you , that' s him
it' s straight enough .
if it' s got the distance ....
it has the distance !
it' s good !
washington wins !
the 65 yard field goal attempt is good by nigel gruff .
washington 17 , san diego 16 .
you the man ! you the man !
oh , bollocks !
come here !
sorry , man sorry , excuse me
all right good game we snuck by on that one
i' il take it all right
i' il take it congrats
what do you think of the new team ?
it' s great !
these guys are like us .
this strike ain ' t about guys like me .
it' s about them superstars ... ... who want $8 million instead of 7 .
to hell with them .
this is the most fun i' ve had in football in years .
go falco !
all right let' s go , baby , let' s go !
i love you , annabelle i know you do , alan we' re closed

so , we were so tight we had so much fun in here
since i was five years old , i been sitting on those stools
and then after he died , i took over
is that you and him ?
yeah
he was the biggest washington fan you have ever seen
other kids got bedtime stories , i got football stories
he used to talk all the time about the glory days of football
said how they were gone forever
i wish he was here to see you guys play
i don' t know about that i do
good game today
thanks
it' s late yeah
us babies need our rest yeah , you do
between the guys on the field and the guys in the bar a girl' s gotta keep her guard up yeah , i imagine yeah
you coming to the game on sunday ?
no , we don' t travel with the team
can i see you when i get back ?
sure
good night , annabelle
good night
what do you do here , john ?
you go for it .
you have to .
but falco' s been shut down by this defense all afternoon .
but i' il tell you this , all it takes ... ... is one big play to get him back in the ball game .
and here goes falco .
falco scores !
falco scores !
here' s falco he' il try to reverse pivot , turn and pitch out here
but in doing so , his left guard , andre jackson , is going to pull and falco will hit him with the ball in the back
then it' s gonna flop around the ground
here comes cochran , he' il kick it franklin' s gonna pick it up
franklin' s gonna get hit right here
the ball will go flying in the air falco will pick it up and the guy who started the play , falco will end up with it in the end zone for a touchdown !
welcome to strike football and the fabulous falco
get to the playoffs .
call time out !
time out !
time out !
time out washington .
franklin , come here , come here , come on
i had it
shut up give me the stick em
that' s illegal think you' il go to football jail ?
now , you know this don' t look natural
don' t talk we' il run the same play you' il catch the ball
i look like i jacked off an elephant !
say you understand
i understand
go out there and catch the ball for a change , all right ?
damn !
this cup is stuck !
gonna need some time on this one
here we go same play pro right switch 9
franklin franklin !
i can' t get the damn cup off ! you can do this
it' s one on one ready ?
ready !
blue 89 !
blue 89 !
and franklin catches the ball !
who would' ve thought ?
he never catches a ball .
but he caught the ball !
that makes the score 21 to 20 .
conventional wisdom says kick the extra point , tie the game ... ... and go into overtime .
especially with the playoffs on the line .
but jimmy mcginty is anything but a conventional guy
and mcginty says go for it
let' s go for the win !
i need a receiver !
4 22 y cross , okay ?
we gotta have it , gotta have it !
ready ?
go !
ready !
this kind of situation has not been falco' s strong point in the past .
falco rolls to his left and throws ... ... right into the defender' s hands .
and he drops it right into the unsure hands of clifford franklin !
washington wins !
what a lucky break for shane falco , who threw a bad pass ... that could' ve blown the game for washington
get over it
it' s a win
better lucky than good ?
right
shane falco
great game out there today thanks
to what do you attribute this team' s sudden rise over these past few weeks ? you know , you should talk to franklin he' s the hero today
clifford franklin terrific day today yeah , today was a good day for clifford franklin
clifford franklin can' t wait till tomorrow
clifford franklin gets better looking every day
we' re beginning to scratch the surface of the talents of clifford franklin
clifford franklin has moves even clifford franklin ain' t seen yet you showed us a few moves today against phoenix but it could be a different story against dallas
that' s the same story , different chapter
the football is like a one man cold to clifford franklin
clifford franklin' s the only one catching it and coming down with it
cheers , babe
i think we got it
what are you up to ?
what ?
i can' t get excited about the future of my team ?
okay , okay , i got some great news
martel and carr have crossed the picket line
with a deal i made them swallow , i can' t not take them back
no
no what ?
i' m sticking with falco
jimmy , come on
have you read the newspaper ?
the entire dallas team has crossed the picket line
thanksgiving night we play the world champions
we have a deal no interference with my coaching
as long as the strike is on , falco is my quarterback
we have to beat dallas to get into the playoffs
falco can' t do that you saw what happened yesterday
jesus christ !
do you think he' il have that luck against dallas too ?
they' il murder him !
he' s just getting his game back
he falls apart when the game is on the line !
that' s been his rap ever since the sugar bowl
21 other men put their faith in you to lead them they' d be heartbroken if you abandoned them before the biggest game of their lives you really are a son of a bitch , you know that ?
what are you doing ?
don' t want to make the same mistake i did in phoenix
we might end up in that situation with dallas
they like to send their safeties put the pressure on yeah , coach ?
it' s over
martel crossed
i' m sorry
chokes with the game on the line " ls that what o' neil said ?
it' s okay
it' s better for the team , right ?
i mean , martel he is the best the guy' s got it all
no
he doesn' t have heart you do
it' s been a privilege
thanks for believing
you give them hell on thursday
i just wanted to tell you before you left
i' m sorry
thanks no , really
i think it' s terrible what they do to you guys
they make you believe that you' re better than you really are
then they pull the rug out from under you
the cruelest thing that they can give guys like you is hope
you' re a real class act , martel
a real class act
she deserves better you' re a sinking ship don' t drag her down with you
take care of my guys
come on , boys , let' s go !

welcome back to nextel stadium in our nation' s capital .
i' m pat summerall and with me as always is john madden
it appears that the strike is coming to a close
martel will be resuming the quarterback position tonight .
i gotta admit , i was looking forward to seeing what falco could do ... ... with one more game .
he made amazing progress the past few weeks ... ... under the tutelage of jimmy mcginty .
he really did .
but tonight it' il be martel leading washington against dallas .
i never thought i' d say this , but . .. ... l' m gonna kind of miss those replacement games .
bring back falco !
ladies and gentlemen , leading your washington sentinels today ... ... welcome back number 7 , eddie martel .
go on , boys !
come on , martel get moving , get moving !
maybe you should try scrambling
brilliant how about a quick kick ?
hey , butler
red 38 !

that' s not how i coach i don' t give a shit because that' s the way i play
that' s the end of the first half . .. ... with a score of dallas 17 , washington 0 .
coach mcginty !
what will washington need to get back into this game ?
heart i' m sorry ? you gotta have heart
can you elaborate ?
miles and miles of heart
there you have it , in a word , from coach mcginty ...
washington will need " heart " to get back into this
i ran it like you said ! you just under threw me !
this isn' t a track meet , asshole you have to look for the ball !
i' il pull you off the field , spoiled punk
is o' neil gonna side with a burnout coach or someone who delivers the fans ?
son of a bitch !
what are you thinking about ?
we got a game to play !
nobody can win with these losers !
i can
falco , great to see you now , get the hell out of my locker room !
coach ?
what took you so long ?
traffic
suit up !
o' neil will fire your ass !

this is bullshit !
i' il end this right now
come and get some !
you big fatty !
this doesn' t change anything
i' m an all pro quarterback !
i got two super bowl rings ! you' re no more than a replacement yeah
i can live with that
my brothers , will somebody please get this asshole out of here ?
get your hands off me , you gorilla !
jimmy mcginty is anything but a conventional guy
and mcginty says , with the playoffs on the line , go for it .
get to the playoffs .
something washington ... ... has not been able to do against dallas in seven years .
falco ?
what the hell is he up to ?
look , here comes falco !
falco' s back !
what happened to martel ?
i don' t know , but the way falco' s running ... ... and that look he has in his eye , he thinks he' s gonna play .
i' m sorry
they' re playing zone and you can pick them apart if you keep your eyes open
he seems to be necking with that cheerleader !
that' s what he' s doing !
players aren' t supposed to be fraternizing with cheerleaders . yeah , but what are they gonna do ?
fire him ? you give me strength you' re late for work
kick ass , falco !
what' s all the celebrating about ?
we' re down 17 to nothing
it' s nasty out there
that' s why girls don' t play the game , coach
listen up this time tomorrow , the strike will be officially over
dallas made a big mistake they haven' t been afraid of you
they should be , because you have a powerful weapon working for you
there is no tomorrow for you
and that makes you all very dangerous people !
kick ass on one ready ?
clifford franklin is looking for a new ho
ready for some pain ?
bring it on it' s coming
it' s coming
see him coming in motion ?
i' ve never seen anything like this !
unbelievable !
there' s at least five , six flags out there .
hats , everything !
this is what you call an old fashioned melee
unnecessary roughness , number 16 and number 34
fifteen yards , so that' s , wait 4530
how many yards so far ?
who do they think they' re playing here ?
come on , let' s go !
come on !
my knee !
it' s my knee !
i think i broke it
did i do it ?
did i score ? yeah , you did it god , it hurts it hurts !
i' m sorry
don' t be sorry going out in front of 80, 000 people ain' t bad you finish what you started
white 24 !
blue 15 !
hut , hut !
first down , washington .
good job i got skills
feel like running the ball ?
better give it to wilkinson
he' s going to jail
i' il clear the way i' m right behind you
we need it , we need it !
a gain of 20 yards by ray smith .
first down .
i know you' re tired , i know you' re hurting
i wish i could say something classy and inspirational
but it wouldn' t be our style
pain heals
chicks dig scars
glory lasts forever
right on , shane
right on , baby right on !
shotgun dc right
flip 90 dig , on the center ready ?
we ' re looking at a different team here in the second half .
absolutely .
washington is playing like there' s no tomorrow ... because there isn' t
touchdown , baby !
son of a bitch !
odd bullets , blitz coverage !
daniel bateman comes up with a big stop on third and one .
that forces a dallas punt .
pat , with 28 seconds remaining , washington needs a decent return ... ... in order to give gruff a shot to tie the game .
with 12 seconds remaining ...
it' s yours , nigel ... a 32 yard field goal . .. ... will send this game into overtime .
32 yards is just a chip shot for gruff
you all right ?
i' m sorry
i had the money but i pissed it away at the track again
what ?
what are you talking about ?
they' il take my pub away from me
it' s all i got
come on , shane !
it' s a fake !
falco still has it !
he ' s running with it !
touchdown , falco !
holding !
number 68 on the offense 10 yard penalty repeat first down
what a terrible call !
time out !
you okay ?
i broke my arm
cheers you saved my ass
take care you' il have to explain to me what that was about
what' s it gonna be ?
i want the ball
winners always do
spread formation
damn !
sorry , shane i' m sorry , everybody
no problem just rip someone' s head off on this one
consider it done
all right so besides me , who really wants the ball ?
yeah , you want it , brian
let' s hook up dc left , wide motion , 88 war
gentlemen
it' s been an honor to share the field of battle with you
we ain' t losing this game
green 86 !
green 86 !
touchdown , brian murphy !
i knew it !
i knew it all along !
jimmy , you beautiful son of a bitch !
i knew you could do it !
washington 20 , dallas 17 .
washington goes to the playoffs !
you did it !
you did it !
when the replacement players for the sentinels left the stadium ... ... there was no ticker tape parade ... ... no endorsement deals for sneakers ... ... or soda pop or breakfast cereal .
just a locker to be cleaned out . .. ... and a ride home to catch .
but what they didn' t know ... ... was that their lives would be changed forever ... ... because they had been part of something great .
and greatness , no matter how brief . .. ... stays with a man .
every athlete dreams of a second chance .
these men lived it .
