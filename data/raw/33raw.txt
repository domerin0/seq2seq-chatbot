i thought sushi came from japan .
i know where sushi come from , nigga .
i ain' t even talking to you .
you know i could smash you right now .
you and your little tricycle friends .
but i' m gonna give you a pass .
consider it a welcome home present .
under one condition .
somebody gonna give my brother a new bike .
i want his bike .
i ain' t giving you shit .
there' s only one way you' re getting one of these bikes .
i know you been gone a long time , ford .
but not long enough to forget who run things around here .
i hate to see you end up as dojo' s dinner .
trey .
one time .
probably not a good time to be feeding dojo anything , huh ?
get that bike from you later .
hey , officer , how' s it going ?
beautiful day today .
what are you waiting for ?
what you think ?
go show these boys how to ride .
how about a ride ?
this thing might be too much for you .
we' il never know till i' m on it .

it' s not that i don' t enjoy your company .
just be gentle with him .
nice bike .
nice ass .
got a name ?
yeah .
ford .
what' s he doing here ?
forecast for today : sun , sun and more sun .
highs 94 to 103 .
don' t forget your sunscreen , folks .
southwest winds 10 to 15 miles per hour , with locally higher gusts .
be with you in a second .
looking for something in particular ?
yeah , you got one of them seats in a pink naugahyde ?
maybe with a little gold fringe ?
you never were funny , ford .
oh , come on , you used to think i was funny .
maybe you lost your sense of humor .
i think i have a pretty good sense of humor .
like the morning you skipped town before agents raided my shop ... ... waving warrants , telling me my boyfriend' s a drug dealer ?
that was funny .
i laughed my ass off for weeks .
i wrote you letters .
i made fires .
i tried to call .
yeah , but my phone was tapped for six months .
that was fun too .
can i explain ?
let me guess .
you' re sorry , you didn' t mean to hurt me , you were trying to protect me ... ... and it wasn' t your fault .
it was my fault .
we' re closed .
the sign said ...
well , the sign lied .
thanks .
you too , ford .
you don' t know how many times i' ve played this out in my head in the last six months .
must be frustrating .
you got balls even coming here .
the feds and the hellions are after you and henry james thinks you stole his bikes .
yeah .
well , that' s because i did .
ford ?
yeah ?
go now , please , before i ...
before what ?
and to think we almost decided to go to the beach this weekend .
lucky for me , luther hates to swim .
henry .
i don' t know why you' re buying a new seat , ford .
looks like you haven' t broken in your old one yet .
looks like ford prefers to ride bitch to me .
it looks to me like you ought to buy a new seat yourself , henry .
share one with your friends long enough and you' re liable to catch something .
heard you were in indochina .
some shit like that .
good food there ?
thailand , actually ... ... but the food was great .
thanks for asking .
you' re a pretty funny guy , ford .
where are my goddamn bikes ?
you really want them ... ... or what' s inside them ?
where are they ?
why don' t you just cut it out of him .
no , he won' t .
he' s too smart for that .
because he knows if he touches me he' il never get his shit back .
then again ... ... l' m not that smart .
shane .
you' ve got till sundown to hand over my bikes .
your brother said we had a deal .
junior don' t do the deals around here , i do .
well , if junior ain' t allowed to make deals , he shouldn' t be allowed to speak .
that' s funny , because i was thinking the same thing .
i didn' t come here to watch you pet your dog , primate .
i didn' t invite your dukes of hazzard ass .
so you can raise up whenever you feel it .
the answer is no .
you' re not slinging your dope on my streets .
hand me that bottle .
look ... ... l' m not some dimebag street punk .
i' m a businessman .
and i' m telling you to make this right .
i wouldn' t give a shit if you was don corleone himself .
the answer is still no .
so get out of my face .
what the hell was you looking at ?
i love you .
trey , what' s wrong ?
i thought you would' ve been down with that shit .
you could' ve made a killing .
first you gonna act a fool up there on the road , now this ?
what' s wrong with you ?
you messing with my goddamn good nature , boy .
go get me a beer , man .
you messing up my buzz .
get me a diet pepsi .
don' t slam my door .
you better count to 10 !
i' m gonna whup his ass .
shut up .
put rasan and nomo on him .
dojo got more sense than that boy .
henry , looks like you' re the one riding bitch .
looks like your engine could use a little work .
what part of " i don' t love you anymore , you' re a bastard ... ... and i never wanna see you again " didn' t you understand ?
how about the part that stops you from driving off right now ?
thirsty ?
all right , one beer .
but you' re buying .
what up , junior ?
you all right ?
no , i' m definitely not all right , man .
move !
watch out , white boy .
call it an accident ?
how about i kick your ass ?
no , i prefer we still call it an accident .
how about now ?
now it looks like you owe me a beer .
junior !
junior !
i' m gonna kill you !
come on , chill !
i' m gonna talk to you .
why you always got to show your ass , man , huh ?
why you can' t come here and play your position ?
look at me , boy .
i love you .
you' re my brother , but you better stop embarrassing me .
stop acting so damn crazy .
and i got your back for life .
well , if you got my back , then show me , blood , on everything !
you ain' t got my back , man .
you ain' t got my back , trey .
forget you , man .
watch out .
get out of my way , man .
dawson' s creek almost beat your brother' s ass , blood .
shut up , man .
go get my dog .
what' re we gonna do about ford ?
junior just solved our problem .
why don' t we just grab him right now ?
no , not now .
i got a better idea .
get the boys .
what is it with you , ford ?
everywhere you go , everything turns to hell .
yeah , it' s a talent i have .
go powder your nose , china .
let' s have some fun .
that' s him .
get him .
there he is .
we' d like to thank the hellions for messing up another gig .
i' m out of here .
he ain' t going anywhere .
here he comes .
there he goes .
get him !
see you , junior .
hey , what' s up , man ?
hey .
what' s up ?
hey , dude .
damn !
you screwed me , junior .
i assume you' re apologizing for setting up a deal you couldn' t do .
i made promises based on your black ass .
and now i' ve got a problem .
but you' re gonna help me out of it .
yo , dog .
just give me time .
i' m gonna talk to trey .
we could work this out , man .
i could make this happen , all right ?
time' s up .
you know what to do , baby ?
there' s this one road that winds up the coast from bangkok to pattani .
it' s got mountains on one side , ocean on the other ... ... so close sometimes it feels like you can just drag your foot in it .
i tell you , the last six months , every time i took that drive i thought about you .
did you come all this way to sell me a trip to thailand ?
you got to the bottom of this beer .
explain away .
all right .
first met henry about a year ago .
i didn' t like him , but he was a paying customer .
i fixed his chopper a couple times .
six months ago , he turns up at your shop ... ... with these two bikes .
he asked me if i' d mind looking after them .
i figure , what the hell , right ?
so i do .
then i go to move them , they don' t start .
so i check the tanks .
they' re filled with kilos of crystal meth .
so first thing , i get them out of there .
so that' s why that fed mcpherson raided my shop after you split .
and you dropped off the face of the earth .
i took off ... ... so that you wouldn' t get dragged into it .
i split .
now i' m the only one involved with henry .
so you left to protect me ?
what' d you think , you were gonna just come back and explain everything ... ... and then we' d just ride off into the sunset together ?
more or less .
well , which is it ?
more or less ?
well , i was actually thinking mexico .
you' re killing me .
get your gear on .
not a good time .
heading to cabo .
shane' s coming .
damn , really ?
yeah .
give me 10 minutes , all right ?
come on .
move .
move , man !
move !
damn !
wait .
that' s my brother , man .
it' s all right .
oh , no .
no , man .
i' m taking him with me .
you can' t do that , son .
now , we' re gonna find out who done this .
if you have any ideas who would want to kill your brother ...
if i knew who did this , you' d have two dead bodies right now .
we got a witness .
says she saw the whole thing .
a white male , mid 20s , rode a custom motorcycle .
wore black and orange leathers .
black and orange leathers ?
hey , you know somebody who fits that description ?
not anymore .
let' s go !
fbl .
agent mcpherson , federal gang task force .
sheriff barnes .
you don' t look like your typical fed .
what' d you expect ?
a cheap suit , late model taurus , a $ 10 haircut ?
how' d y' all get here so fast ?
get this many motorheads in one place , all wearing colors ... ... something' s bound to happen .
pays to be close .
oh , this is agent henderson .
don' t let her good looks fool you .
she' s one of the best field operatives .
excuse me , i have to take this .
yeah .
hi , baby .
i' m at a crime scene right now .
it' s a typical homicide .
typical homicide ?
maybe you can explain to me what a typical homicide is .
all right , i' il take care of it .
yeah , i promise .
i' ve got an eyewitness .
you do ?
yeah .
you' ve practically got this solved .
i love you too .
jesus christ .
we' ve got the murder weapon and she saw the whole thing .
congratulations .
i don' t care if we have to comb every inch of california .
i want that boy ford , and i want his head in dojo' s bowl by midnight .
amen ?
amen .
come on , boy .
motel policy for cash customers .
jay .
got him .
son of a bitch .
i tried to pop ford six months ago .
he' s cute .
you can visit him in prison .
map .
that' s why you broke , you eat too much .
i got it .
that' s okay .
what were you planning on paying with , your good looks or your smile ?
i love a girl who can take care of herself , man .
i would' ve come back too .
if you boys will excuse me .
it seems like i' m overdue for some paint and bodywork myself .
so , what are you gonna do about henry ?
we got a plan , right ?
yeah , once we' re in the clear , i' m gonna tell henry where he can pick up his shit .
of course ... ... l' m also gonna call that punk mcpherson and tell him .
arrange a get together with the evidence .
that way everybody gets what they deserve , right ?
henry gets his shit , mcpherson gets henry ... ... and we all go to mexico and get drunk .
as i reported earlier , wallace , a member of an inglewood motorcycle gang ... ... the reapers , was brutally murdered last night with a motorcycle chain .
cary ford , a white male in his late 20s .
ford was last seen riding a black custom motorcycle ... ... wearing orange and black racing leathers .
if you have any idea as to his whereabouts ... ... please contact the local authorities .
cary ford is now the prime suspect in the murder of junior wallace .
call the sheriff , hal .
ford was just spotted at lone pine .
let' s drive a little .
yeah .
heard on the scanner they spotted the white boy .
dawson' s creek , the white boy .
all right , get me a map .
we gotta make up some time .
yeah ?
give me ford .
ford .
it' s for you .
ford .
change in plans .
seems your buddy junior' s dead .
feds think you did it .
reapers think you did it .
hell , everybody thinks you did it .
you tell me where my stuff is and it all goes away .
i don' t take orders , henry .
never have , never will .
what' s that ?
ever heard that what you put out comes back tenfold ?
you spent too much time in chink land , ford .
what does that mean ?
it means i don' t wanna be next to you when the shit hits the fan .
and by the way , henry ... ... " chink land " implies china .
i was in thailand , it' s a different country .
hey , my phone !
hold it right there .
everybody down on the ground !
quit shooting !
you got the wrong guy .
we' il let the sheriff sort it out when they get here .
are you okay ?
i got it under control !
i didn' t kill anybody .
shit !
you earl ?
loved your french toast .
down .
like i said ... ... i love a girl who can take care of herself .
thanks .
you' re on the news .
that guy you got in a fight with is dead .
henry set me up .
he wants his drugs back .
why don' t you give them back .
it' s the only insurance i got .
you were with me last night .
i' m your alibi .
down , earl !
tell the cops .
right now it ain' t the cops that i' m worried about .
not good .
reapers !
he' s right , shane .
you think we could finish this conversation later ?
all right .
once we' re in the clear , you call the cops .
agreed ?
what should i do with this ?
forget what i said about liking women who can take care of themselves .
sorry , it' s gonna get crazy .
you' il be safer here than running with us .
see you back in l. a. what am i supposed to do ?
hang out with earl ?
which way ?
which way did you say , old man ?
which way ?
shortcut !
let' s catch them , kill them and bury them !
they' re still on us !
shit !
there' s more of them !
what are we gonna do , ford ?
where we going ?
i' m working on it !
which way did they go ?
damn !
come on !
now can we call the cops ?
no .
why not ?
because it' s not just the cops , it' s mcpherson .
mcpherson ?
the guy that tore up your shop .
he already thinks i' m a drug dealer .
now he thinks i shot junior .
and he has no reason to think otherwise ... ... unless i can prove it .
bad just turned to worse .
bent link .
this just keeps getting better and better .
i got a spare in my toolkit .
he was strangled , by the way .
who ?
junior .
he was strangled with a bike chain .
shit .
henry used the chain off his own bike .
how do you know that ?
how do you know ?
yeah , how did you know that ?
well , it' s ...
it' s complicated .
you turning left , or we going to oregon ?
it' s right .
it' s right ?
what ... ?
get the finger out of my face .
i know where i' m going .
henry just screwed himself .
see those scratches and nicks ?
yeah .
well , it picks them up from the sprocket .
now , no two bikes got the same chain wear pattern ... ... because no two sprockets are the same .
so we match the chain used to kill junior with henry' s bike ... ... and we got him .
like a fingerprint .
try not to move your lips so much when you think .
now we call the cops , right ?
now we call the cops .
real cute , guys .
get a room .
mcpherson , it' s f ...
ford .
looks like you' re trading up .
going from drug trafficking to first degree murder .
i was set up .
in my business i hear that a lot .
loud .
recorder' s on .
who wants to set you up ?
henry james .
leader of the hellions .
now , why would he wanna do that ?
those drugs you were looking for belong to henry .
i stashed them the night before you raided the shop .
he wants them back .
tell me where the drugs are , i might buy that' d give henry motive .
maybe we can work something out .
" maybe " don' t cut it .
arrest henry ... ... then i' il take you to the drugs .
arrest him ?
on what grounds ?
first degree murder .
what if i tie the murder weapon to henry ?
big " if .
arrest him .
get his bike , i' il show you .
get his bike .
okay .
anyone else you' d like me to arrest ?
ex girlfriend , second grade teacher ... ?
hold on , i' m making a list .
you' re not listening to me .
henry killed junior .
i don' t know that .
then you can' t help me !
well , that didn' t fly .
screw it .
let' s haul ass down to mexico and don' t look back .
as much as i hate to say it , i agree with him .
we' re going to l. a. oh , yeah .
that makes sense .
i have to get henry' s bike .
that will clear me .
they' il have checkpoints on every dirt road between here and the coast .
we' re not exactly hard to spot driving these .
you wanna ditch the bikes ?
no , i' d rather be fast than invisible .
come on .
wouldn' t be any fun if it was easy , right ?
i live my life a quarter mile at a time .
that is the dumbest thing i' ve ever heard .
po po got the highways blocked from here to l. a.
l. a. ?
why would he go to the one place he know i got on lockdown ?
let' s catch him on the interstate .
no , he' s smarter than that .
he trying to backdoor us .
he going through the palms .
that' s the way i' d go .
and that' s the way we going .
you know , henry james did pull six months in l. a. county last year for possession .
maybe ford is onto something .
then you can' t help me !
call in .
check everything from lone pine and l. a.
you think ford' s going back to l. a. ?
he' s going after henry james .
if he' s right and henry did set him up , that' s what i' d do .
let' s go !
you have to pay for the gas .
oh , right .
reapers !
we' il lose them in the palms !
are you crazy ?
i hate it when he does this !
they going into the trees !
i could see that , fool !
stay on ford .
i got his ass !
they' re shooting at us , ford !
i know !
what do we do ?
go right !
they' il follow me !
meet the twins !
all right , ford !
just you and me , baby !
shouldn' t pick on girls .
you all right ?
i just jumped my bike onto the roof of a moving train .
it' s amazing what you can do when you have no choice .
where are val and dalton ?
he had me , dog .
he had me .
i was gone !
he' s the one snatched me up out of there !
i' m trying to figure out why .
he ain' t acting like no killer !
your brother' s dead and cracker' s on the run .
shit don' t feel right .
don' t sound right , don' t look right .
only way we can find out is to get our hands on him .
i' m with that .
then get your black ass up and let' s go !
everybody , let' s go !
first time val' s beat you anywhere !
must be the chick .
yeah , i stopped for a manicure .
want this hour' s bad news ?
every major road in l. a. is blocked .
i know you said it wouldn' t be any fun if it was easy ... ... but does it have to be this much fun ?
you said you could make this go away .
how ?
sometimes witnesses forget what they saw .
refuse to testify .
you still want your shit back ... ... l' il call you when i get to l. a. 3 : 00 tomorrow afternoon .
what ?
jay , something doesn' t sit with me .
ford doesn' t profile up as a killer .
yeah ?
good instincts , henderson .
listen , i gave ford a chance to tell the truth six months ago .
he ran .
i gave him another chance last night .
he ran again .
innocent men , henderson , don' t run .
he went for it !
now we just gotta get past the several hundred cops between us and l. a.
god , i hope you have a plan this time .
yeah , i got a plan .
you gonna leave without me ?
oh , my god .
check it out , man .
holy shit .
seen three bikers and a chick on a couple of crotch rockets in the last hour ?
must be something in the water up here .
okay .
words strung together into sentences obviously bewilder you .
let me try again .
three dudes ... ... a girl ... ... and a couple of bikes .
don' t know .
seen a lot of truckers .
really ?
one girl .
man , you should' ve seen the pair ...
shut up .
does this thing work ?
ford .
what is wrong with you ?
sorry .
is it fried ?
yeah .
so you never actually told me why you chose thailand .
well , i just wanted to go someplace that wouldn' t remind me of you .
oh , yeah ?
how did that work out for you ?
not real well .
no ?
oh , come on , admit it .
you' re so glad i came back .
i just had nothing better to do this weekend .
why we stopping in the middle of the interstate ?
roadblock .
sir !
you' re clear .
go ahead .
move it out .
go ahead and send the next one !
check the second one back !
good evening , officer .
could you step out of the vehicle , please .
there a problem ?
no , sir .
just a routine check .
you mind opening her up ?
no , not at all .
where you coming from ?
barstow .
much drier in barstow .
yeah , just a little .
hey , ed !
what are you doing back so soon ?
i got a race in l. a. tomorrow night .
he' s all right .
regular hero here on the local circuit .
let him through .
yes , sir .
hey , ed , good luck tomorrow night .
beat it .
thanks , frank .
ford should' ve called us by now .
he' s just having a good run .
don' t sweat it , man .
we got over a mil riding on this !
we' re looking at life in prison if ford doesn' t go down as planned .
don' t tell me not to sweat it .
so grab yourself a candy bar and shut your mouth .
that' s a sweet hog , man .
look at that beast !
live to ride .
or that .
yeah .
could we get a picture of you guys ?
we' re on a road trip , we e mail people on our buddy list where we' re at .
could we do that ?
who' s in love ?
they are .
right there .
give me a big smile , like you guys are human .
he blinked and she blinked .
look at this .
let' s do it again .
this time , no blinking .
smile .
now what ?
it' s also about financial freedom .
what can i do for you ?
why don' t you open up the back for me .
that' s a long truck .
don' t touch me .
that' s weird .
what ?
my lock' s gone .
you waiting for a green light ?
let' s go , make a hole !
truck' s broke .
call a tow truck .
are you done ?
get in .
i' m driving .
fuck the police !
was that a threat ?
i think it was .
ford , traffic !
this is why i hate four wheels .
hey , you' re gonna have to make a break !
we go together !
no , you and val can get shane out of this !
no way , i' m going with you !
no , you' re not .
goddamn it , ford !
i always knew you had a thing for me .
get her out of here !
hey !
watch out .
and i' m not gonna stand for it .
i wanna return the bike .
you can take it back .
what do you mean i can' t bring it back ?
okay , there' s only 200 miles on the bike .
if you say one more word ...
asshole !
hello ?
hung up again !
bikers .
this is crazy !
we can call backup .
if you don' t like my driving , henderson , you can get out and hitch .
no way !
thank god for airbags .
shut up .
come on , ford .
you got this wrong !
damn !
damn !
crazy white boy !
look , man , i don' t wanna ...
you think you man enough to drop that hammer ?
don' t want to .
i didn' t kill junior either .
if i did , i would' ve let you die at the tracks .
why didn' t you stick around and talk ?
i didn' t think this would go all that well .
all right .
you didn' t kill him , who did ?
henry james .
he set me up .
so i' m supposed to just believe what you say now ?
well , see for yourself .
i' m taking him down .
you don' t believe me , you can always shoot me then .
you dropped this .
this better be someone with good news or money .
what would you say if i gave you junior' s killer and henry' s drugs at the same time ?
where ?
you know the address .
you busted its doors down about six months ago .
meet me there in two hours .
crystal meth .
i don' t suppose we got a spare set of hands ?
yeah ?
