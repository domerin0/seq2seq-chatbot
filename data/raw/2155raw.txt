how do you do ?
mr carl laemmle feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning .
we are about to unfold the story of frankenstein .
a man of science , who sought to create a man after his own image , without reckoning upon god .
it is one of the strangest tales ever told .
life and death .
i think it will thrill you .
it may shock you .
it might even horrify you .
so if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain , now is your chance to , er ...
well , we' ve warned you .
... dona eis , domine : et lux perpetua luceat eis .
amen .
down .
down , you fool !
now !
come on !
hurry , hurry .
the moon' s rising .
we' ve no time to lose .
careful !
here he comes !
he' s just resting .
waiting for a new life to come .
here we are .
look , it' s still here .
climb up and cut the rope .
no !
go on .
it can' t hurt you .
here' s a knife .
look out !
here' s the knife .
here i come .
is it all right ?
the neck' s broken .
the brain is useless !
we must find another brain .
that' il do , gentlemen .
and in conclusion , ladies and gentlemen , here we have one of the most perfect specimens of the human brain ever to come to my attention at the university .
and here , the abnormal brain of the typical criminal .
observe , ladies and gentlemen , the scarcity of convolutions on the frontal lobe as compared to that of the normal brain , and the distinct degeneration of the middle frontal lobe .
all of these degenerate characteristics check amazingly with the history of the dead man before us , whose life was one of brutality , of violence and murder .
these jars will remain here for your further inspection .
thank you , gentlemen .
the class is dismissed .
herr victor moritz .
victor .
i' m so glad you' ve come .
what is it , elizabeth ?
oh , you' ve heard from henry .
yes .
the first word in four months .
it just came .
victor , you must help me .
of course i' il help you .
i' m afraid .
i' ve read this over and over again , but they' re just words that i can' t understand .
listen .
you must have faith in me , elizabeth .
wait .
my work must come first , even before you .
at night , the winds howl in the mountains .
there is no one here .
prying eyes can' t peer into my secret .
what can he mean ?
what does he say then ?
i am living in an abandoned watchtower close to the town of goldstadt .
only my assistant is here to help me with my experiments .
oh .
his experiments .
yes , that' s what frightens me .
the day we announced our engagement , he told me of his experiments .
he said he was close to a discovery so terrific that he doubted his own sanity .
there was a strange look in his eyes .
some mystery .
his words carried me right away .
of course , i' ve never doubted him .
but still , i worry .
i can' t help it .
and now this letter .
all this uncertainty can' t go on .
i must know .
victor , have you seen him ?
yes .
about three weeks ago .
i met him walking alone in the woods .
he spoke to me of his work , too .
i asked him if i might visit his laboratory .
he just glared at me and said he would let no one go there .
his manner was very strange .
oh , what can we do ?
if he should be ill !
now , don' t worry .
i' il go to dr waldman , henry' s old professor in medical school .
perhaps he can tell me more about all this .
victor , you' re a dear .
you know i' d go to the ends of the earth for you .
i shouldn' t like that .
i' m far too fond of you .
i wish you were .
victor .
i' m sorry .
good night , victor .
and thank you .
thank you .
good night .
and don' t worry .
promise ?
i won' t .
victor !
what is it ?
i' m coming with you .
you can' t !
i must .
i' il be ready in a minute .
herr frankenstein is a most brilliant young man , yet so erratic .
he troubles me .
i' m worried about henry .
why has he left the university ?
he was doing so well and he seemed so happy with his work .
you know , his researches in the field of chemical galvanism and electrobiology were far in advance of our theories here at the university .
in fact , they had reached a most advanced stage .
they were becoming dangerous .
herr frankenstein is greatly changed .
you mean changed as a result of his work ?
yes .
his work .
his insane ambition to create life .
how ?
how ?
please tell us everything , whatever it is .
the bodies we use now , dissecting them for lecture purposes , were not perfect enough for his experiments , he said .
he wished us to supply him with other bodies , and we were not to be too particular as to where and how we got them .
i told him that his demands were unreasonable , and so he left the university to work unhampered .
he found what he needed elsewhere .
oh .
the bodies of animals .
well , what are the lives of a few rabbits and dogs ?
you do not quite get what i mean .
herr frankenstein was interested only in human life .
first to destroy it , then re create it .
there you have his mad dream .
can we go to him ?
you will not be very welcome .
what does that matter ?
i must see him .
dr waldman , you have influence with henry .
won' t you come with us ?
i' m sorry , but herr frankenstein is no longer my pupil .
but he respects you .
won' t you help us to take him away ?
very well , frulein .
i' ve warned you .
but if you wish it , i will go .
fritz !
hello .
have you finished those connections ?
yes , they' re done .
well , come down , then , and help .
we' ve lots to do .
look out !
fool !
if this storm develops as i hope , you will have plenty to be afraid of before the night' s over .
go on , fix the electrodes .
this storm will be magnificent .
all the electrical secrets of heaven .
and this time we' re ready .
hey , fritz ?
ready .
oh !
why , what' s the matter ?
look .
there' s nothing to fear .
look .
no blood , no decay .
just a few stitches .
and look .
here' s the final touch .
the brain you stole , fritz .
yes .
think of it the brain of a dead man waiting to live again in a body i made with my own hands .
with my own hands .
let' s have one final test .
throw the switches .
good .
in 15 minutes , the storm should be at its height .
then we' il be ready .
what' s that ?
there' s someone there .
shh !
quiet .
send them away !
nobody must come here .
here .
cover this .
whoever it is , don' t let them in .
leave them to me .
of all the times for anybody to come !
now !
i' il show them , messing about at this time of night .
got too much to do .
wait a minute !
all right , all right !
wait a minute , i' m coming .
it' s dr waldman , fritz .
you can' t see him .
go away .
all right , knock !
you won' t get in .
henry !
frankenstein !
henry !
frankenstein !
henry !
open the door !
let us in !
who is it ?
what do you want ?
you must leave me alone now .
it' s elizabeth !
open the door !
henry !
frankenstein !
what do you want ?
open the door !
you must leave me alone .
at least give us shelter .
what' s this nonsense of locked doors ?
henry !
elizabeth , please , won' t you go away ?
won' t you trust me just for tonight ?
you' re ill .
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
i' m quite all right .
truly i am .
can' t you see i mustn' t be disturbed ?
you' il ruin everything .
my experiment is almost completed .
wait a moment .
i understand .
i believe in you .
but i cannot leave you tonight .
you' ve got to leave !
henry , you' re inhuman .
you' re crazy !
crazy , am i ?
we' il see whether i' m crazy or not .
come on up .
you' re quite sure you want to come in ?
very well .
forgive me , but i' m forced to take unusual precautions .
sit down , please .
sit down !
you too , elizabeth .
please .
a moment ago , you said i was crazy .
tomorrow , we' il see about that .
don' t touch that !
i' m sorry , doctor , but i insist .
please .
doctor waldman , i learnt a great deal from you at the university about the violet ray , the ultraviolet ray , which you said was the highest colour in the spectrum .
you were wrong .
here , in this machinery , i have gone beyond that .
i have discovered the great ray that first brought life into the world .
oh .
and your proof ?
tonight you shall have your proof .
at first i experimented only with dead animals , and then a human heart , which i kept beating for three weeks .
but now i' m going to turn that ray on that body , and endow it with life .
and you really believe that you can bring life to the dead ?
that body is not dead .
it has never lived .
i created it .
i made it with my own hands from the bodies i took from graves , from the gallows , anywhere .
go and see for yourself .
you too .
dead , hey ?
quite a good scene , isn' t it ?
one man crazy , three very sane spectators .
yes !
test the batteries .
look .
it' s moving .
it' s alive .
it' s alive !
it' s alive .
it' s moving .
it' s alive !
it' s alive !
it' s alive !
it' s alive !
it' s alive !
henry , in the name of god !
in the name of god ? !
now i know what it ...
henry is well , but he' s very busy .
he said he would get in touch with you soon .
don' t worry about him , baron .
he' il be home in a few days .
you two have it all arranged , haven' t you ?
you think i' m an idiot , don' t you ?
but i' m not .
anyone can see with half an eye that there' s something wrong .
and i' ve two eyes , and pretty good ones at that .
well , what is it ?
you' re quite mistaken , baron .
what' s the matter with my son ?
what' s he doing ?
he' s completing his experiments .
why does he go messing around an old ruined windmill when he has a decent house , a bath , good food and drink , and a darned pretty girl to come back to ?
would you tell me that ?
baron , you don' t understand .
i understand perfectly well .
there' s another woman , and you' re afraid to tell me .
pretty sordid experiments these must be .
huh !
oh , but you' re wrong !
and how do you know ?
if you please , herr baron , the burgomaster .
well , tell him to go away .
but he says it' s important .
nothing the burgomaster can say can be of the slightest importance .
good day , herr baron .
frulein .
well , what do you want ?
if it' s trouble , go away .
i' ve trouble enough .
oh , there' s no trouble , sir .
what do you mean , " no trouble " ?
there' s nothing but trouble .
i brought you these flowers .
thank you , herr vogel .
both in my private and official capacities as burgomaster ...
yes , yes , yes , we know all about that , but what do you want ?
what i really want to know is when will the wedding be , if you please .
unless henry comes to his senses , there' il be no wedding at all .
but the village is already prepared .
well , tell them to unprepare .
but such a lovely bride ...
such a fine young man , the very image of his father .
heaven forbid .
but , sir , everything is ready !
i know that !
don' t keep on saying so , you idiot !
there' s nothing to cry about .
good day , miss elizabeth .
good day , herr moritz .
good day , herr vogel .
good day , herr baron .
and good riddance to you .
there you are .
huh !
you see how it is .
the whole village is kept waiting , the bride is kept waiting , and i am kept waiting .
henry must come home , if i have to fetch him myself .
no , no , baron .
what about his work ?
stuff and nonsense .
what about his wedding ?
there is another woman ... and i' m going to find her .
come and sit down , doctor .
you must be patient .
do you expect perfection at once ?
this creature of yours should be kept under guard .
mark my words , he will prove dangerous .
dangerous ?
poor old waldman .
have you never wanted to do anything that was dangerous ?
where should we be if nobody tried to find out what lies beyond ?
have you never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars ?
or to know what causes the trees to bud ?
and what changes the darkness into light ?
but if you talk like that ... people call you crazy .
well , if i could discover just one of these things what eternity is , for example
i wouldn' t care if they did think i was crazy .
you' re young , my friend .
your success has intoxicated you .
wake up and look facts in the face !
here we have a fiend whose brain ...
whose brain must be given time to develop .
it' s a perfectly good brain , doctor .
well , you ought to know .
it came from your own laboratory .
the brain that was stolen from my laboratory was a criminal brain .
oh , well .
after all , it' s only a piece of dead tissue .
only evil can come of it .
your health will be ruined if you persist in this madness .
i' m astonishingly sane , doctor .
you have created a monster and it will destroy you .
patience , patience .
i believe in this monster , as you call it .
and if you don' t , well , you must leave me alone .
but think of elizabeth .
your father .
elizabeth believes in me .
my father ?
he never believes in anyone .
i' ve got to experiment further .
he' s only a few days old , remember .
so far , he' s been kept in complete darkness .
wait till i bring him into the light .
here he comes .
let' s turn out the light .
come in .
come in .
sit down .
sit down !
you see ?
it understands .
watch .
take care now , frankenstein .
take care .
shut out the light .
sit down .
go and sit down .
it understands this time .
it' s wonderful .
frankenstein , where is it ? !
aagh !
quiet , you fool !
get away with that torch .
aagh !
quick !
fetch the rope , quick .
stop pushing .
get him to the cellar .
shoot it !
it' s a monster .
quiet .
quiet !
stop that !
you' il have the whole countryside on us !
come away .
he has the strength of ten men !
here , give me that !
come away , fritz .
leave it alone .
leave it alone .
listen .
what' s that ?
who' s there ?
it' s fritz !
come on , doctor .
quick , hurry .
get back .
get out !
come on , quickly .
he hated fritz .
fritz always tormented him .
come , pull yourself together .
what can we do ?
kill it , as you would any savage animal .
we must overpower him first .
get me a hypodermic needle .
it' s murder .
it' s our only chance .
in a few minutes , he' il be through that door .
come , quick .
hurry .
got it ?
yes , here it is .
it' s very strong .
half grain solution .
good .
now then .
you stand there .
when he goes toward you , i will make the injection in his back .
ready ?
yes .
aagh !
get back !
back !
dr waldman .
dr waldman !
are you hurt ?
no , i' m all right .
it' s nothing .
see who' s at the door .
what' s happening ?
elizabeth and your father are coming to see you .
keep them out .
too late !
they must not see that .
here , quick , give me a hand .
quick !
henry , hurry , get that blood off your face before your father and elizabeth get here .
well , er ...
pretty sort of place for my son to be in , i must say .
is that the front door ?
yes , this is it .
right .
i don' t like it , but ... here goes .
there doesn' t seem to be anybody in the place .
god ...
what a ...
what a forsaken place .
are you trying to burn it down , eh ?
what' s that for , eh ?
well , what' s the matter with you ?
you look as if you' ve been kicked by a horse .
where' s henry ?
why ...
well ?
he can' t be disturbed just now .
oh , can' t he ?
huh !
i' il soon settle that nonsense .
victor , where is he ?
this place seems to drive everybody crazy .
oh , heavens ...
what' s that ?
i beg your pardon .
i am dr waldman .
oh , are you ?
i' m baron frankenstein .
perhaps you know what all this tommyrot' s about .
i ...
i' il be shot if i do !
i advise you to take henry away from here at once .
well , what do you suppose i' m here for ?
pleasure ?
nah .
where are you , my dear ?
oh , there you are .
let' s see what' s up the awful stairs .
i don' t know how the deuce i' m going to get up ' em , but ...
leave them alone .
no banisters or anything else ...
how much further ?
come in .
henry .
elizabeth .
henry !
victor !
dr waldman !
come quickly .
my dear , what have they done to you ?
poor fritz ...
it' s all my fault ...
get him on the sofa .
have you got any brandy ?
quick , quick , quick .
here , i' il do that .
my boy ...
now , now ...
now drink .
drink this .
there .
there , that' s better .
i' m going to take you home with me , henry .
no , i can' t .
my work .
what will happen to the records of my experiment ?
we will preserve them .
and ...
i will see that it is painlessly destroyed .
yes , yes .
leave it all to me .
poor fritz .
all my fault .
there , henry .
you can' t do any more now .
you must come home until you get well again .
you' il soon feel better when you get out of here .
it' s like heaven being with you again .
heaven wasn' t so far away all the time , you know .
i know .
but i didn' t realise it .
my work .
those horrible days and nights .
i couldn' t think of anything else .
henry , you' re not to think of those things any more .
you promised .
all right .
let' s think about us .
when will our wedding be ?
let' s make it soon .
as soon as you like .
for three generations , these orange blossoms have been worn at our weddings .
your great grandfather wore this , henry .
looks as good as new now , hey ?
and here .
here is one to make the best man look still better .
30 years ago , i placed this on your mother' s head , henry .
today , you' il make me very happy by doing the same for elizabeth .
and i hope , in 30 years ' time , a youngster of yours will be carrying on the tradition .
and now , how about a little drink , eh ?
my grandfather bought this wine and laid it down .
my grandmother wouldn' t let him drink it .
bless her heart .
here' s to your very good health .
well , are you all full ?
yes ?
come along .
here' s a health to a son of the house of frankenstein .
a son to the house of frankenstein .
here' s a jolly good health to young frankenstein .
young frankenstein .
give the servants some champagne .
this stuff' s wasted on ' em .
well , well , well .
go on , mop it up .
it' il do you good .
house of frankenstein .
to the house of frankenstein .
now then .
now be off about your business .
listen !
listen to ' em !
the boys and girls of the village are out here .
it' s extraordinary how friendly you can make a lot of people on a couple of bottles of beer .
tomorrow they' il all be fighting .
no doubt !
they' re calling for you , baron .
hey ho .
well , i suppose i' d better show myself .
quiet !
thank you all very much indeed .
i' m very pleased to see you all , and i hope there' s plenty of beer .
there' s lots more where that came from .
you stay here , maria .
i' il just take a look at my traps .
then we' il go to the village and have a grand time , huh ?
you won' t be long , daddy ?
oh , no .
if franz comes by , tell him i' il be back soon .
daddy , won' t you stay and play with me a little while ?
i' m too busy , darling .
you stay and play with the kitty , huh ?
bye , daddy .
goodbye .
be a good girl now .
come on , kitty .
who are you ?
i' m maria .
will you play with me ?
would you like one of my flowers ?
you have those , and i' il have these .
i can make a boat .
see how mine float ?
ohh !
no , you' re hurting me !
no !
henry .
elizabeth !
how lovely you look .
but you shouldn' t be here .
i must see you for a minute .
why ?
what' s the matter ?
could you leave us for a moment ?
why , of course .
why , what is it ?
i' m so glad you' re safe .
safe ?
of course i' m safe .
but you look worried .
is anything wrong ?
no .
no , forget my foolishness .
it was just a mood .
there' s nothing the matter .
of course there isn' t !
henry , i' m afraid .
terribly afraid .
where is dr waldman ?
why is he late for the wedding ?
he' s always late .
he' il be here soon .
something is going to happen .
i feel it .
i can' t get it out of my mind .
you' re just nervous .
all the excitement and preparation .
no .
no , it isn' t that .
i' ve felt it all day .
something is coming between us .
i know it .
i know it !
sit down and rest .
you look so tired .
if i could just save us from it .
from what , dear ?
from what ?
i don' t know !
if i could just get it out of my mind !
i' d die if i had to lose you now , henry .
lose me ?
why , i' il always be with you .
will you , henry ?
are you sure ?
i love you so .
sure .
how beautiful you look .
henry !
henry !
what' s that ?
what' s that ? !
henry !
dr waldman !
what about dr waldman ?
henry , don' t leave me !
no , darling , you stay here .
henry !
henry !
dr waldman' s been murdered in the tower .
the monster .
he' s been seen in the hills , terrorising the mountainside .
he' s in the house .
he' s upstairs !
it' s in the cellars .
it' s elizabeth !
come on .
elizabeth !
what is it ?
don' t let him come here .
no , no , no , darling .
it' s all right .
don' t let him come here .
it' s all right , darling .
it' s all right .
oh , look !
that' s maria !
silence !
silence !
silence !
what is it ?
maria .
she' s drowned .
my poor man .
why do you bring her here to me ?
but ...
but she has been murdered .
silence !
i' il see that justice is done .
who is it ?
how is elizabeth now ?
i don' t know .
she' s still in a daze .
just looks at me and says nothing .
it' s maddening .
easy , old man .
she' il be all right .
our wedding day .
steady .
your wedding will be postponed a day at most .
a day ?
i wonder .
what do you mean ?
there can be no wedding while this horrible creation of mine is still alive .
i made him with these hands , and with these hands i will destroy him .
i must find him !
i' il go with you .
no .
you stay here and look after elizabeth .
i' il leave her in your care , whatever happens .
you understand ?
in your care .
quiet !
quiet !
quiet !
ludwig .
you will search the woods .
those are your group .
we' il get him !
quiet !
herr frankenstein .
you will take to the mountains .
those are your people .
i ...
i will lead the third group by the lake .
and remember ... remember ... get him alive if you can , but get him !
quiet !
search every ravine , every crevasse , but the fiend must be found !
are you ready ?
light your torches and go !
stop !
frankenstein , mountains !
ludwig !
lake party , this way !
come on , boys !
keep together .
you search there .
the rest , come with me .
look lively !
come on !
come on !
herr frankenstein !
herr frankenstein !
come on , men !
quick !
this way !
which way did he go ?
which way did he go ?
tell me !
tell me !
over there .
you stay here and take care of him .
the rest , follow me .
come on !
come on , quick !
no , come back !
this way .
herr frankenstein !
herr frankenstein , where are you ?
i think he' s up there .
come on , follow me .
quick !
hello !
fire .
fire !
help !
help !
listen .
help !
it' s frankenstein .
that way !
this way !
come on , hurry !
hurry !
look , they' re there !
turn the hounds loose !
there he is !
the murderer .
he' s alive .
frankenstein !
frankenstein .
bring him down to the village and let' s take him home .
murderer !
burn the mill !
burn the mill !
he can' t get away !
aaagh !
have you got it ?
come on , hurry .
quiet , quiet .
well , go ahead and knock .
well , well , well , what' s all this ?
what do you want , hey ?
what' s this ?
if you please , herr baron , we thought that mr henry could do with a glass of his great grandmother' s wine .
fine old lady , my grandmother .
very foreseeing of her to prevent my grandfather drinking this .
mr henry doesn' t need this .
as i said before , i say again , here' s to a son to the house of frankenstein .
yes , indeed , sir .
we hope so , sir .
