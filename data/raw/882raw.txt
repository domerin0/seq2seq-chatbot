i' m a red sea pedestrian , and proud of it !
sex , sex , sex .
that' s all they think about , huh ?
well , how are you , then , officer ?
ladies and gentlemen , the next contest ... is between ...

jaguars ' earlobes .
wolf' s nipple chips .
get ' em while they' re hot .
they' re lovely .
dromedary pretzels , only half a denar .

i do feel , reg , that any antilmperialist group like ours ... must reflect such a divergence of interest within its power base .
oh , great .
francis ?
yeah , i think judith' s point of view is very valid , reg , provided the movement never forgets ... that it is the inalienable right of every man or woman . or woman to rid himself
or herself . or herself
agreed .
thank you , brother .
or sister .
or sister .
where was i ?
i think you finished .
oh , right .
furthermore , it is the birthright of every man
or woman .
why don' t you shut up about women ?
women have a perfect right to play a part in our movement .
why are you always on about women , stan ?
i want to be one .
what ?
i want to be a woman .
from now on , i want you all to call me " loretta .
what ?
it' s my right as a man .
well , why do you want to be loretta , stan ?
i want to have babies .
you want to have babies ?
it' s every man' s right to have babies if he wants them .
but you can' t have babies .
don' t you oppress me .
i' m not oppressing you .
you haven' t got a womb .
where is the fetus gonna gestate ?
you' re gonna keep it in a box ?
here , i' ve got an idea .
suppose you agree that he can' t actually have babies , not having a womb which is nobody' s fault , not even the romans ' but that he can have the right to have babies ?
good idea , judith .
we shall fight the oppressors ... for your right to have babies , brother
sister .
sorry .
what' s the point ?
what ?
what' s the point of fighting for his right to have babies ... when he can' t have babies ?
it is symbolic of our struggle against oppression .
symbolic of his struggle against reality .
it' s dangerous out there .

having grabbed his wife , we inform pilate that she is in our custody ... and forthwith issue our demands .
any questions ?
what exactly are the demands ?
we' re giving pilate two days to dismantle ... the entire apparatus of the roman lmperialist state , and if he doesn' t agree immediately , we execute her .
cut her head off ?
cut all her bits off .
send them back on the hour , every hour .
and , of course , we point out that they bear ... full responsibility when we chop her up ... and that we shall not submit to blackmail .

oh , yeah , yeah .
they did give us that .
and the sanitation .
oh , yeah , the sanitation , reg .
remember what the city used to be like .
yeah , i' il grant you , the aqueduct and sanitation are two things the romans have done .
and the roads .

i mean , the roads go without saying , don' t they ?
but apart from the sanitation , the aqueduct and the roads
lrrigation .
medicine .
education .
yeah , all right .
fair enough .
and the wine .
yeah , that' s something we' d really miss , reg , if the romans left .
public baths .
and it' s safe to walk in the streets at night .
yeah , they certainly keep order .
they' re the only ones who could in a place like this .
all right , but apart from the sanitation , the medicine , education , wine , public order , irrigation , roads , the fresh water system and public health , what have the romans ever done for us ?
brought peace .
oh , peace !

there is not one of us who would not gladly suffer death ... to rid this country of the romans once and for all .

if questioned , we are sewage workers on our way to a conference .
reg , our glorious leader and founder of the p. f. j. , will be coordinating consultant at the drain head , though he himself will not be taking part in any terrorist action ... as he has a bad back .
aren' t you going to come with us ?
solidarity , brother .
oh , yes , solidarity , reg .
once in the sewer , timing will be of the essence .
there is a roman feast later in the evening , so you must move fast .
and don' t wear your best sandals .
turning left here , we enter the caesaraugustus memorial sewer , and from there proceed directly to the hypocaust .
this has just been retiled .
so , terrorists , careful with those weapons .
we will now be directly beneath pilate' s audience chamber itself .
this is the moment for habbakuk to get out his prong .

they hung me up here five years ago .
every night , they take me down for 20 minutes , then they hang me up again , which i regard as very fair in view of what i' ve done .
and if nothing else , it' s taught me to respect the romans , and it' s taught me that you' il never get anywhere in this life ... unless you' re prepared to do a fair day' s work for a fair day' s
oh , shut up !

ninebladed not two or five or seven , but nine which he will wield on all wretched sinners , just like you , sir , there .

and nobody will really know where lieth ... those little things ... with the sort of raffia work base that has an attachment .
at this time , a friend shall lose his friend' s hammer , and the young shall not know where lieth ... the things possessed by their fathers ... that their fathers put there only just the night before about 8 : 00 .
yea , it is written in the book of cyril ... in that time

some things in life are bad .
they can really make you mad .
other things just make you swear and curse . " when you' re chewing on life' s gristle
don' t grumble give a whistle
and this' il help things turn out for the best
and
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the light side of life " " lf life seems jolly rotten there' s something you' ve forgotten
and that' s to laugh and smile and dance and sing
when you' re feeling in the dumps " " don' t be silly chumps
just purse your lips and whistle , that' s the thing
and always look on the bright side of life
always look on the bright side of life " " for life is quite absurd
and death' s the final word " " you must always face the curtain with a bow
forget about your sin
give the audience a grin " " enjoy it , it' s your last chance anyhow
so always look on the bright side of death
just before you draw your terminal breath
life' s a piece of shit when you look at it
life' s a laugh and death' s a joke , it' s true
you' il see it' s all a show people laughing as you go
just remember that the last laugh is on you
and always look on the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
come on , brian .
cheer up . " always look on the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
worse things happen at sea , you know ? " always look on the bright side of life
what have you got to lose ?
you come from nothing .
you go back to nothing .
what have you lost ?
nothing ! " always look on the right side of life
nothing will come from nothing .
you know what they say ? " always look on " cheer up , you old bugger . " the bright side of life " give us a grin .
there you are .
see ?
it' s the end of the film .
incidentally , this record' s available in the foyer . " always look on the right side of life
who do you think pays for all this rubbish ? " always look on the bright side of life
i told him .
i said to him , " bernie , there' il never make their money back . " " always look on the right side of life
