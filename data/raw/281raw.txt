are you ok ?
thanks for taking my life
huh ?
i didn' t suffer at all
one blow and i' m in heaven
we had to meet ,
like this ,
on a night like this
it was such a boring evening ,
i was drinking around at this late hour ,
on my way home from work , all alone ...
i was wandering around the city
but i don' t find it strange at all
even a tragic meeting like this
isn' t a coincidence at all
you and i , " we were destined to meet right now , like this
to see our last dream together
just you and i ,
our last dream ...
hey !
what' s wrong with you ?
why' re you singing all of a sudden ?
you' re the one i was meant to meet
at the very end ,
and then part
we meet , and then i die
isn' t this the most shortlived
and bittersweet love story ever ?
between the curtain rising and then falling on the act ,
is only a matter of a few minutes
would you believe that
a love so brief would even exist ?
love ?
tragedy , you see ,
has a tendency to turn into
a romantic drama
let me see your face more clearly
let' s look into our eyes when we talk
that way , " we' il see each other' s heart better
we don' t have much time ,
before the moon is clouded over
our time together
is short
wait a sec !
what' re you talking about ?
just speak normally !
we only have one life to live
i tried to live it as preciously as i could " but something went wrong along the way
i just killed you !
how can you talk like that ?
i' ve been living a lie
i' ve been lying to myself that i don' t feel any pain
what ?
i' ve been lying to myself that i don' t feel any pain
that' s your own business just go off and die on your own
why' d you have to come and show up in my life ?
i didn' t mean to
look , i didn' t mean to kill you
i know
i beg you , just forgive me !
keep me warm
i wanted to be with someone
dance ... !
you were just dancing !
hey
c' mon , just once more !
don' t go cold on me !
hlgh voltage
we' ve apprehended the suspect
give it back !

move back to where i can' t see you hurry !
i' il shoot her for real !
move back , goddammit !
hurry , or i' il shoot !
no reception !
i' il call , sir
evacuate civilians and secure the perimeter !
i' m finished !
yes , we' re trying to apprehend the suspect
how' d he steal your gun ?
because you weren' t paying attention !
don' t worry , he doesn' t have the guts to pull the trigger
hey you !
you know what you' re doing ?
let the girl go !
shut up or i' il shoot her !
calm down !
it' s not too late
don' t make me do it if she gets shot , it' s your fault !
you !
don' t upset him !
damn , what do i do now ?
i haven' t thought of anything
a hostage !
jesus , what a drag ...
what am i gonna do about you now ?
copy that !
our back up' s here , sir
got it tell them not to upset him
the suspect' s excited , so please don' t upset him
i know !
i' m supposed to demand something , like a helicopter
wait , i get airsick easily
can' t believe this is happening to me
shit , i' m probably finished
hey , how come i' m the only one talking here ?
say something
a cold one , aren' t you ?
you' re no fun
can you see with that ?
sure , i cheated on exams with this
so what do you see ?
hey , how about this ?
damn , i wanna pull the trigger
my finger' s gonna move by itself
he' s pointing the gun at his own head
that' s not good
man , my finger' s itching should i just do it ?
why' re you so quiet ?
you think an idiot like me should just die , don' t you ?
what the hell !
where' s the bullet ?
first one' s blank next one' il fire , for real
give it back !
drop the gun !
i' il shoot , dammit !
what the fuck !
just go away !
go away !
the last one was blank , but the next one' s real !
give back my gun !
i' il kill you !
go back !
good !
hey , hey , what' re you doing ?

hey there now that' s dangerous
what' re you doing ?

hey , what the hell ...
you' re ok now don' t worry !
don' t worry !
the next one' il go off !
there' s no point in doing that , so c' mon , give it up , hurry
get back !
don' t upset her !
i got it , i got it ...
that' s dangerous !
hand it over !
that' s a bad idea just give it up
ok , so i understand how you feel now so give it back now !
give it back !
you' re still young you don' t wanna die
wait , you wanna die ?

i believe meeting someone is never a coincidence
i was waiting for this all along
i' m alive ...
