it all started on the day that i died .
if there had been an obituary ... ... it would' ve described the unremarkable life ... ... of an unremarkable woman ... ... survived by no one .
but there was no obituary ... ... because the day that i died ... ... was also the day i started to live .
but that comes later .
this was my life .
days blended together , consistently ordinary ... ... thanks to a job that was the practical version of my passion .
i' m sorry .
watch where you re going !
i was supposed to be an artist by now .
instead ... ... i was designing ads for beauty cream .
you are so addicted to that stuff , sally .
happily .
beau line is magic in a bottle .
i don' t know how you get it .
it' s not even in production yet .
we have our ways .
hey .
no !
headaches again .
my brain' s all tight and cranky .
in one week , precisely , we will launch the most exciting ... ... and revolutionary product to hit the beauty industry since ... ... soap .
beau line .
now , beau line doesn' t just hide the effects of aging ... ... it actually reverses them .
however , with change ... ... must come sacrifice .
my husband ... ... and i have decided that it' s time for me to step aside ... ... as the face of hedare .
it has been a magnificent 15 years .
but we have decided to choose a new face to represent beau line .
exactly .
drina .
the future of hedare beauty .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , i look forward ... ... to seeing you at the gala , where you can toast to drina and our success .
careful , george .
she' s not old enough to drink .
you' ve got more talent than anybody in the building , which i hate you for .
sal , this is my first lead campaign .
it' s gotta be perfect .
you know that .
what is wrong with you ? !
good luck .
yeah .
you simply couldn' t resist it , could you ?
you had to make a scene out of it , laurel .
what' s the matter , george ?
did i steal your moment ?
come in !
hi , mr. hedare .
did you still want to see me , or ... ?
sit .
right .
okay .
i' m not pleased .
this isn' t even close to what i wanted .
i can' t imagine what on earth you were thinking .
i am so sorry
i mean , look at this red .
it' s all wrong .
i wanted it darker .
i specifically heard you say  i know what i said .
okay .
maybe i misunderstood you .
clearly .
mr. hedare , i know i can fix it .
if you give me a chance , i know i can fix it .
i do not reward incompetence .
i have no idea why i expected your art to show better taste than your wardrobe .
oh , and do try and get a manicure , will you ?
oh , for god' s sake , george .
let her fix it .
she' s good and you know it .
whatever .
by tomorrow night .
midnight .
right .
thank you .
excuse me .
hi !
do you think you could just maybe turn the music down ... ... just a little bit ?
no ?
okay .
kitty !
kitty .
how' d you get up there ?
come down here .
what , are you stuck ?
you' re gonna make me come out there .
hey !
easy !
hold on a minute !
wait !
wait !
wait !
whatever you' re thinking or feeling ... ... it' s not worth it , you understand ?
i' m a cop .
maybe i can help .
okay .
i' m fine .
it' s just that  listen to me .
we' il get through this together .
what' s your name ?
patience phillips .
but this cat ...
sure , sure , patience , and it' s a real beauty .
very cute .
the cat' s not up here anymore .
okay .
and i' m sure that makes you very sad .
what' s your apartment number ?
twenty three !
hold on !
hurry .
i got you .
you okay ?
thanks .
you sure you' re okay ?
that was the cat .
you weren' t kidding .
you actually climbed out there to rescue your cat ?
yeah .
i mean , no .
it' s not my cat , it' s a cat .
to rescue somebody else' s cat ?
well , that' s something else .
oh , my gosh , i' m late for my job !
i' m on a deadline today .
yeah ?
well , good luck with that .
thanks .
thank you !
after all , no one can defeat father time .
though you did put up a hell of a fight , didn' t you ?
beau line works wonders , doesn' t it ?
yes , it does .
i have a busy day today .
drinks , then dinner .
don' t wait up , will you , darling ?
i stopped waiting a long time ago , george .
oh , and that lunch tomorrow ?
cancel that too , will you ?
problems ?
i doubt it ... ... but slavicky won' t stop calling .
you know scientists .
they' re worse than models .
you have to coddle them all the time like little children .
i' il have wesley reschedule .
bye .
hey !
man sandwich , 12 o' clock .
oh , my god .
hello , miss phillips .
hi .
this is the officer i was telling you about from earlier .
detective lone .
tom lone .
god , that is such a good name .
tom lone .
rhymes with cone , phone , bone .
not that rhyming' s all that important .
i' il just be in my cubicle .
alone .
hi .
hi .
how' d you get ... ?
you dropped something .
you can really cover a lot of ground when you' re in a hurry .
thanks .
is this yours ?
yeah .
it' s nice .
thanks .
yeah , it kind of reminds me of early chagall .
elegant , but whimsical .
very much in the ... ... tradition of the old dutch masters .
i' m impressed .
don' t be .
i noticed all the art in your apartment , so i googled it at the office .
no , but really , i like it .
thanks .
listen , i wanted to apologize about this morning for thinking you were a jumper .
i was hoping to make it up by taking you to coffee .
i know this great italian place around the corner , grecchio' s on 6th .
or , listen , maybe tomorrow' s better .
say , 1 : 00 ?
yes .
okay .
yeah ?
okay .
so tomorrow then , 1 : 00 .
you make sure she gets there .
yes , officer .
counting on you .
i screw it up ... ... you can throw away the key .
see you tomorrow .
okay , bye .
patience .
that is a man in serious like with you .
you think ?
hello .
we got a lot of work to do .
first , you gotta shave those legs .
second , wear that leather outfit we got you for your birthday .
remember ?
first , it' s only coffee .
and second , i will never , ever , ever wear that leather outfit .
good night !
hi , this is patience in the art department .
yeah , i' m expecting a messenger to come and pick up
but it' s gotta be there by midnight .
well , i ...
i know it' s not your fault , but ...
okay .
i' il take it myself .
hello ?
is anybody in there ?
oh , come on , slavicky .
when did you grow a conscience ?
i don' t care that the fda never saw the headaches ... ... and the nausea and the fainting spells .
those are symptoms i can live with .
hello ?
and with what we stand to make from consumers demanding their fix ... ... i can live with it being addictive .
but these side effects from the long term studies ...
that won' t happen if they keep using it .
and we' il make sure they do ... ... because that' s where the money comes from .
i' m not sure anymore .
hello ?
hello ?
i thought i could live with it ... ... but i can' t live with turning people into monsters .
oh , my gosh !
you' ve gotta let me pull the plug .
we can' t let this go on the shelves .
who' s there ?
armando , come in .
i' m on my way .
you can come out now .
it' s okay .
we' d just like to ask you a few questions .
sorry .
but i think maybe i' m in the wrong
what are you doing ?
don' t ever do that again .
where is she ?
she ran down to waste treatment , jumped in a pipe .
we don' t know who she is , but we know what she heard .
we can' t risk it .
get rid of her .
seal the door .
patience phillips , i' ve never been so proud of you .
you ' re probably sipping your decaf soy whatever ... ... fantasizing about licking the foam off his lips .
wait , that' s what i' m doing .
how' d the presentation go ?
did you get me free samples of it ?
listen , call me .
what ... ?
hi , i' il take a decaf latte .
hey , patience , it' s tom lone .
i' m here at grecchio' s waiting ... ... and you ' re not here .
anyway , i gotta get back to work , so ...
bye .
okay , kitty .
it' s time for you to go home .
now ...
are you ophelia powers ?
yes .
i got your cat off a ledge and ever since  why , midnight .
you' ve never brought a stranger home before .
please , come in .
no , i can' t come in .
i' ve got to go to i' m late .
midnight .
i' m sorry ?
her name .
she' s an egyptian mau , the rarest of breeds .
temple cats .
it' s said that maus have special powers .
like popping out of nowhere ?
i know .
among other things .
your cat ...
socrates !
no caffeine .
it makes him irritable .
you look a little out of sorts yourself , my dear .
the cats , perhaps .
they seem to be taking quite an unusual shine to you .
this has been a really bad day for me already .
i can' t even remember most of yesterday .
perhaps i can help you .
right .
this really isn' t your problem .
i don' t even know why i' m here .
it' s all right .
tell me .
really .
i' m late for work .
i' m sorry .
i shouldn' t even ...
come back anytime .
i' m always here .
catnip .
no
i' m fine .
i am fine .
what the hell is wrong with you ? !
you never delivered the design !
you don' t even know where they are .
you do not know where they are because , and i quote you , you " cannot remember " !
your incompetence is staggering !
are you even listening to me ?
i' m sorry !
sorry " ?
sorry' s not nearly enough .
okay .
then let me try the remix .
i' m sorry for every second i wasted ... ... working for an untalented , unethical egomaniac like you .
clean out your cubicle .
you are fired .
wait !
mr. hedare !
i didn' t mean it .
did i ?
my hero .
where did that come from ?
i don' t know , it' s like i can' t describe it .
i was saying it , but i wasn' t saying it .
do you understand ?
whoever said it has the thanks of a grateful art department .
you don' t understand , sal .
i wanted to cause him pain .
i' m sorry .
what was that ?
allergies ?
maybe ?
you just got fired , remember ?
but it' s so pretty .
sal ?
sal ?
sally ?
sally !
sally ?
hey .
ever noticed when they keep you for observation no one really observes you ?
did they tell you what was wrong ?
oh , they have no idea .
they did run a million fun tests , though .
hey , upside , you gotta see my doctor .
i can see you' re feeling better .
reminds me , what' s up with the " hot yet modest , but who cares ... ... because he' s so hot " detective ?
it' s not gonna work out , sal .
patience , you never think it' s gonna work .
because it doesn' t .
i' ve got a good reason for saying it this time .
trust me .
look , this time i refuse to let you sabotage a good thing .
if it' s broke , fix it .
all right ?
now , i love you , and he is gonna love you .
now , go .
go give him some brown sugar .
i gotta meet my hottie doctor .
tell me i look vulnerable .
being good is something you keep in your heart because you put it there .
i' m not saying it' s easy .
i' m not saying some people don' t choose to be bad .
but i want something different for you .
i want something better .
you understand ?
yeah .
can i see your gun ?
no .
you know what makes somebody  will you shoot it ?
no .
i want you to be the good guys , got it ?
yeah .
let' s go shoot some hoops .
i called the police station and they said you might be here .
you never got your coffee .
well , you' re a brave man to be facing a mob like this .
no backup ?
i' m used to working alone , most of the time .
is that by choice , or  yeah , theirs .
no , i' ve had partners before .
turns out i take my job too seriously .
you know my friend sally ?
that' s what she says about me .
she says that i' m fun deficient .
i don' t believe that .
that' s what she says .
one on one ?
who ?
me and her ?
yeah , come on .
you wanna do this ?
one on one one on one
i haven' t done that since i was a kid .
come on .
can we have our ball back ?
you don' t seem so fun deficient to me .
mr. hedare wanted me to inform you he' il be at the factory the rest of the day .
if by " factory " you mean the four seasons ... ... teaching drina to unlock the minibar ... ... consider me informed .
he' il be working with
wesley , george hasn' t said anything meaningful to me since he said " i do .
hello ?
you' d think with the advances ... ... in medicine , this place would have a wet bar .
seems like you' re feeling better .
some new medication i can' t pronounce .
so , what' s up ?
nothing .
just fixing a little snack .
what i' d like to know is did you fix it with the cute cop ?
i think i did .
details !
and make it good , honey .
i' m sitting here in a paper dress , for god' s sakes .
all we did was talk .
and play a little one on one .
you know how to play basketball ?
apparently i do .
i even went shaquille on his butt .
patience , have i taught you nothing ?
you never beat a guy at sports .
it messes them up .
they end up in a men' s group , banging on a drum .
it' s not like i meant to .
it just happened .
i' m telling you , sal , something really , really weird is happening to me .
i practically jumped him .
that' s called lust , sweetheart .
animal attraction .
you think ?
what if it gets worse ?
i mean , what if the next time  next time ?
he asked you out again ?
i love this guy .
so do i. but it' s me i' m worried about .
i felt like i couldn' t be myself .
well , feel free to be me next time .
sally  i' m teasing .
just be yourself .
myself .
okay .
i' il try .
oh , i gotta go .
future father of my children' s coming .
sweet dreams , honey .
excuse me .
i think i might have a fever .
hey !
shut that off !
get a life !
yeah , get a life , you loser !
sorry , babe .
this ain' t the slumber party .
however ... ... in your case , i can make an exception .
i' m flattered .
but do you think this one time ... ... you could turn the music down just a little ... ... bit .
tell you what , why don' t i do it myself ?
hey !
hey !
listen , you freak
i' m sorry , what did you say ?
is the music still too loud ?
hey !
you hear that ?
it' s called silence .
that' s all i ever wanted .
now , keep it down .
thanks for the party .
i had fun .
time to accessorize .
my bike !
amateurs .
you boys thought you could come in here and steal all these beautiful things ?
what a perfect idea .
meow .
that was one of a kind .
from egypt .
that' s a hell of a profile .
thieves said she jumps around like a cat .
what should we call her ?
cat chick " ?
no , no . " cat broad .
what do you got ?
cupcakes .
midnight .
i knew you' d come back when you were ready .
the goddess bast .
the maus are sacred to bast .
they' re her messengers .
you wrote this ?
i was a professor for 20 years ... ... until i was denied tenure .
male academia .
bast is a rarity .
a goddess of the moon , and of the sun .
she represents the duality in all women .
docile , yet aggressive .
nurturing , yet ferocious .
but what does all of this have to do with me ?
i mean
what happened the other night ?
i don' t remember .
do you want me to tell you ?
yes .
you died .
what ?
i didn' t die .
look at me , i' m right here .
you died .
but you were reborn .
oh , you' re crazy .
you are a crazy cat lady .
midnight knew your fate .
that' s why she tested you .
to see if you were worthy of a gift she could give you .
a gift that could change your life ... ... and give you a new one .
you' re not alone , child .
he' s saved others before you .
look .
catwomen are not contained by the rules of society .
you follow your own desires .
this is both a blessing and a curse .
you will often be alone and misunderstood .
but you will experience a freedom other women will never know .
you are a catwoman .
every sight , every smell ... ... every sound , incredibly heightened .
fierce independence , total confidence , inhuman reflexes .
so i' m not patience anymore ?
you are patience .
and you are catwoman .
accept it , child .
you' ve spent a lifetime caged .
by accepting who you are , all of who you are ... ... you can be free .
and freedom is power .
you saved my life , midnight .
but somebody killed me ... ... and i' ve got to find out who , and why .
you dealt with slavicky ?
it' s done .
oh , my god .
we danced all night .
been here all night .
absolutely .
keep the change .
what can i do for you ?
white russian .
no ice , hold the vodka , hold the kahlua .
cream .
straight up .
looking for something ?
the other night you killed somebody .
she was a nice girl .
why ?
cat got your tongue ?
i don' t know .
they told me to flush the pipes so i flushed the pipes .
why ?
i don' t know why .
beau line .
there' s something wrong with beau line .
she heard something she wasn' t supposed to hear .
and hedare is covering it up .
i can' t live with turning people into monsters .
hey , hey , hey .
wow !
you look amazing .
do you like it ?
love it .
like the hair ?
love the hair .
did good ?
you did real good .
this guy is good for you .
aren' t you glad i pushed you into it ?
props to sally .
let me hear my props .
props to sally .
yeah .
clothes , and a treat .
so are you gonna be okay , or what ?
i do feel better .
that' s maybe laying off the cosmos for a couple days .
check this out .
some chick in a cat suit murdered slavicky last night .
the actions of this lunatic will not keep beau line off the shelves .
we will launch next week as planned ... ... because we owe it to the women of this country .
because  please .
that guy is so full of himself .
i' m almost out .
let' s see .
how long have you been having headaches ?
about a month .
do me a favor .
stop using this .
why ?
because it' s making you sick .
trust me .
thank you , lieutenant .
you' re gonna roll with him .
for tom , from forensics .
oh , and slavicky homicide .
maybe you' il want to look at that .
hey , bob , let me ask you a question .
would your wife crawl out on the ledge of a building to rescue a cat ?
maybe , if the cat was carrying a pizza .
well , there are similarities .
shape of the s , harsh stroke of the r' s .
were they written by the same person ?
well , it' s not an exact science .
but this first one .
the broad spacing of the letters ?
indicative of loneliness .
and the o reaching out , insecure .
handwriting of a people pleaser .
now , we look at the loop of the y.
very self confident , almost angry .
and the o , well , this person doesn' t like to play by the rules .
so they' re different people .
very .
if you put these two women in the same room ... ... you' re gonna have one hell of a party .
you got a big weekend planned , tom ?
i do now .
aren' t you supposed to let me win ?
not that kind of girl .
what kind of girl is that ?
a loser .
hey , can i ask you a question ?
you work for hedare , right ?
somebody was murdered at his factory the other night .
i' m sorry .
can you think of anybody who might have a grudge against the company ?
lots of people .
george hedare isn' t the nicest guy in the world , you know .
he fired me .
what ?
am i a suspect now , detective ?
no .
looks like we' il be up here for a while .
you in a hurry ?
mom !
hey !
don' t move !
hold on tight .
i gotta stop this thing .
mom !
frankie .
mom !
mom !
help , mom !
mom !
help , mom !
help !
help !
you are one tough little guy , you know that ?
take it easy , partner .
bye .
it' s over .
well , i' m not sure how you did it , but i' m impressed .
well , i saw how you did .
and so am i.
you know what ?
what ?
we should celebrate .
why don' t you let me take you to dinner tonight ?
i would love to , but i can' t .
not tonight .
i' ve got ... ... some business that i have to take care of .
you picked the wrong house .
you' re the cat that killed slavicky .
you don' t believe everything you see on tv , do you ?
what do you want ?
your husband .
is he home ?
i' m here .
why on earth would he be home ?
oh , too bad .
if your husband ever comes home , tell him i know all about beau line .
it' s disease in a jar .
i wouldn' t caulk a sink with it .
come on .
i' ve been using it for years .
it' s your funeral .
because whoever killed slavicky did it to keep beau line' s toxic little secret .
are you suggesting that my husband is a murderer ?
i' m suggesting that you tell me where he is .
so i' il ask him myself .
i suppose i should be shocked .
protest his innocence .
but the truth is ... ... that man' s capable of anything .
you wanna find him ?
there he is .
thanks .
i' d like to help .
how can i reach you ?
i' m not exactly listed .
take my phone .
call the cops .
you' re not going to believe this .
i think this is a total waste of time .
don' t .
what ?
think .
ever .
consider it a condition of our relationship .
i love this part .
who the hell ?
like my nails ?
just got them done .
my bad .
get your paws off me this instant !
i know about beau line , and your cover up .
what ?
so did my girl , patience .
that' s why you killed her .
what ?
i didn' t kill her  too bad your last words will be a lie .
freeze !
hey !
hold it right there .
don' t you move .
now , come down from there nice and easy .
cats come when they feel like it .
not when they' re told .
i won' t tell you again .
you turn around .
hands on your head .
you' re under arrest .
gotcha !
you think this is a game ?
now we' re playing .
you' re playing .
i' m at work .
seems like you love your job .
don' t i get din din first ?
i' il feed you in your cell .
careful .
that cable hits us , we' re both fried .
i knew i felt a spark between us .
not on the first date .
don' t flatter yourself .
i' m taken .
does she know about us ?
there' s no " us .
too bad .
it' s over .
there she is .
okay , boys .
show of hands .
who can see in the dark ?
i can .
but this is a disaster !
it' s a total bloody disaster .
how does she know all this ?
who is she , anyway ?
and how come ?
it' s all right .
don' t be scared .
great .
you haven' t got a clue , do you ?
don' t be scared " ?
no .
my advice to you , george ... ... quit the self tanning .
stop eating viagra like they' re vitamins .
resist the urge to date children born the same day they invented the cell phone .
for once , george , in your miserable life ... ... be a man !
terrific .
beau line works wonders , doesn' t it ?
okay , sal .
what do you think ?
i don' t know .
you going to a church or a playboy mansion ?
well , that was helpful .
i' m such a freak .
please , i' m a freak thursday through sunday , big deal .
okay , but what if he doesn' t like ... ... the real me ?
he can' t pick and choose , patience .
if he wants this to work , he' s gonna have to like all of you .
senora hedare .
perdon .
go .
pretty .
thanks .
oh , you too .
but i was talking about the fish .
detective work is like dating .
it' s all about the pursuit .
but when you catch them
you like your sushi , huh ?
that' s good .
so tell me about this one ... ... that got away .
catwoman .
you heard of her ?
oh , yeah .
hot , black leather , whip .
she kissed me .
really ?
yeah .
what do you think about that ?
depends .
you like bad girls ?
only if they like me back .
no , listen , bad isn' t something that does it for me .
okay , bad , good .
gotta be something in between , right ?
maybe it' s a little more complicated .
why don' t we talk about you ?
okay .
what' s it like to be an artist ?
well , i' m not really an artist .
i mean , yeah , i did go to art school ... ... but then i got a regular job at an advertising agency ... ... and now i don' t really know what i am anymore .
well , i know what you are .
you' re different .
you' re special .
and i like that about you .
thanks .
no , it' s true .
and i want to know more about you .
you know ... ... i guess there' s a few things i need to explain .
like what , your new look ?
huh ?
your dunk shot ?
no , that' s not what i was thinking .
hey .
you can tell me anything .
i' m ...
i hate the rain !
what were you saying ?
nothing important .
tom ?
it' s me .
you were right about beau line' s secrets .
i can' t believe it , but you were right .
beau line is toxic .
i have proof .
we can stop him , but we have to stop him together .
george will be launching beau line at a press conference tomorrow .
beau line will be on the shelves on monday .
so , what' d you find ?
enough evidence to put someone away for a long , long time .
i was everything they wanted me to be .
i was never more beautiful .
never more powerful .
and then i turned 40 and they threw me away .
it' s all there behind the desk .
how' d i do ?
the clawed flesh thing was a little tricky ... ... but i think i pulled it off .
you killed him ?
no one is gonna stop beau line ... ... from hitting the shelves .
not slavicky .
not george .
and certainly not you .
i' m sorry .
i' m forgetting my manners .
can i offer you something ?
can of tuna ?
saucer of milk ?
smoking gun ?
which , sweetheart , you just emptied into my husband' s chest .
oh , george !
help , somebody help !
it' s catwoman !
she killed george .
oh , my god !
patience .
i' m sorry .
i guess you could take this right out of my hands if you wanted .
if i wanted .
i' m telling you , slavicky had evidence that beau line was toxic .
that' s why laurel killed him .
george found out and she killed him too .
she was covering it up .
the gun in your hand .
catwoman' s hand .
what' s the difference ?
guess it doesn' t matter .
don' t you understand ?
all of the evidence , every single piece , it points to you .
there' s nothing that shows me anything else .
there' s me .
you can believe me .
do you remember the first time you saw me ?
yeah .
what did you see ?
a girl ... ... rescuing a cat .
no , you didn' t .
you saw a crazy person out on a ledge trying to jump .
and all the evidence pointed to that , didn' t it ?
i really need you to believe me .
how can i ?
i don' t know who you are .
i' m the same girl you were with last night .
take her back .
you be a nice kitty , now .
look at it this way , lone .
you may have lost your woman , but at least you got your man .
did i ?
yeah .
hello , midnight .
you' ve spent a lifetime caged .
by accepting who you are , all of who you are ... ... you can be free .
and freedom is power .
it' s not just about me anymore , midnight .
you know ... ... lassie would have brought me a key .
cross your paws .
we ' re gonna shift change in half an hour .
all right .
dave' s gonna take over then ?
yeah , as far as i know .
yeah , right through here , pal .
you' il get to talk to a lawyer .
are you okay ?
a girl like me lands on her feet .
wait !
wait !
my husband dreamed of a world ... ... where every woman could be as beautiful as she wanted to be .
he dedicated his life pursuing that dream .
as hedare' s new chief executive ... ... i intend to make that dream a reality ... ... by proceeding with tomorrow' s launch of beau line .
thank you !
thank you so much .
i have been dying to get some of this stuff .
my husband would have wanted you to have it .
he wanted that for everyone .
detective lone .
what a surprise .
yeah ?
everyone , this is the man that brought my husband' s killer to justice .
can i talk to you , in private ?
come upstairs to my office .
number five , ready to go .
yeah , yeah .
yeah , go ahead .
right there .
get a move on .
gotta meet that midnight delivery .
i saw her standing over him .
there were claw marks all over his body .
but not on slavicky' s .
because she didn' t have the time .
she also didn' t have a motive .
i don' t know .
what if i told you i know the truth ?
that i know who killed your husband , i know about beau line .
why , detective , you make it sound like i' m a suspect .
what if i told you i had evidence ?
if you have evidence , then how come i' m not in cuffs ?
well , you' re a smart woman , mrs. hedare .
beautiful .
rich .
i thought maybe we could work something out .
so this evidence ...
you' il make it disappear ?
pin it on the other girl ?
if that' s what you want me to do .
and you ?
what do you want ?
you just gave me what i want .
you just told me it was you .
now , why would you believe it was me ?
because i finally trusted a friend .
yeah , well , your friend just got you killed .
don' t be stupid , laurel .
you don' t want to kill a cop .
i' m a woman , lone .
i' m used to doing all kinds of things i don' t wanna do .
give my regards to my husband .
how sweet .
thanks .
now i can kill you both .
hold on , i gotta stop .
how is it ?
well , there goes my jump shot .
listen .
i want you to know i' m sorry .
i should have trusted you all along .
you' re confusing me with somebody else .
come on , patience .
i' il take this side .
i can' t believe i ever trusted you .
you' re a fake .
and what are you ?
a hero ?
a thief ?
a freak ?
if you don' t have an identity , why keep it a secret ?
because you killed me .
it was me you flushed down the pipes .
i' m patience phillips .
that' s who' s under there ?
i can' t be hurt .
beau line .
you stop using it and your face disintegrates .
and if you keep using it , skin like living marble .
and you can' t feel a thing .
you' re just a scared little girl playing dress up .
nobody .
nothing .
where do you think you' re going ?
you' re gonna look like a cop killer .
you wanted to save him .
honey , you couldn' t save yourself .
game over .
guess what .
it' s overtime .
give me your hand !
help me !
i might not be a hero , but i' m certainly not a killer .
you know ... ... once laurel' s boys start talking ... ... we' il be able to wrap up these murder cases pretty easy .
and if patience is back in her cell by tomorrow morning ... ... it' il be awfully tough to prove that she was catwoman .
exactly .
delicious , thank you .
you know , the strawberry was good too .
the day i died was the day i started to live .
in my old life , i longed for someone to see what was special in me .
you did , and for that you' il always be in my heart .
but what i really needed was for me to see it .
and now i do .
you ' re a good man , tom .
but you live in a world that has no place for someone like me .
you see , sometimes i' m good .
oh , i' m very good .
but sometimes i' m bad .
but only as bad as i wanna be .
freedom is power .
to live a life untamed and unafraid is the gift that i' ve been given ... ... and so my journey begins .
