well , well , well .
what do you pay your pit crews with , oreos and gummi bears ?
i folded , atley .
you know that .
what are you doing here ?
is there someplace we can talk ?
about what ?
about your brother and the deep shit he' s in .
frank .
would you watch the kids for a minute ?
tell me about kip .
he took a job and he fumbled it .
now he' s jammed up .
he' s jammed up bad .
what kind of job ?
a boost .
a big boost .
a boost .
what' s kip doin ' on a boost ?
oh , you' re shittin ' me , man .
kip' s become quite the little crew runner since you left .
you don' t talk to your ma ?
she neglected to mention it .
listen , i need somethin ' .
i i need somethin ' cold to drink .
i thought we were goin ' someplace to talk .
who was the job for ?
a new guy named raymond calitri .
they call him " the carpenter .
he' s runnin ' all the dark ponies down there now .
it' s a full on " devil came down to long beach " trip .
he' s bad .
he' s real bad .
and this calitri is the one who' s after my brother ?
like stains on a mattress .
and you should know , i work for him .
there weren' t a lot of opportunities for retired car thieves on the gimp .
he put me to work .
but i gotta tell you , memphis , this guy , he scares the shit out of even me .
what are you doing , man ?
stop !
stop !
atleyjackson .
right .
they have kip .
take me there .
raymond calitri , memphis raines .
i try to learn your ways , understand your obsessions .
but this baseball , it' s so bleeding boring .
isn' t it ?
where' s my brother ?
memphis raines .
your legend precedes you .
atley tells me you' re the best .
after you left , auto theft in the south bay area went down 47 percent .
where' s my brother ?
i' m proud of these .
straddle chair from the arts and crafts period .
mahogany table with cloud lift pattern .
black walnut wine table .
metal' s cold , ugly .
wood' s warm , clean .
provided by nature .
to see a piece of furniture take shape , it' s like watching a child grow .
i asked you a question .
they threw us out england , threw us out of france , but here we are .
flourishing , really , except for the minor inconvenience of despising everything about your country .
on this list you' il fknd 50 cars fkve , zero .
i need all 50 delivered to long beach harbor , pier 1 4 , by 8 : 00 a . m . four days from now .
i' m paying $200, 000 .
i' m not interested .
i' m just here for my brother .
your kip came to me .
he had street cred .
the brother of the notorious memphis raines .
so two weeks ago i hired him and advanced him $1 0, 000 .
atley told me .
if it' s about the advance , i can understand your anger .
a debt has to be settled .
ten grand , from me to you .
i wish it was that easy .
i don' t see the complication .
i have four days to deliver 50 cars , and i have no cars .
well , that' s another problem .
it is another problem , isn' t it ?
it' s about me delivering 50 top end cars because i said i would ... because if i don' t my south american friend goes somewhere else from now on .
and that' s not good .
it' s a humiliation .
because i' m the asshole who said i could deliver .
am i an asshole ?
do i look like an asshole ?
yeah .
i need that paper satisfked .
i' m retired .
now , where the hell is my brother ?
i made this as well .
my fkrst one .
it takes 80, 000 pounds of pressure to crush a car .
kip ?
who' s that ?
memphis .
oh , shit .
you okay ?
shut it off ! .
turn it off ! .
you' ve got 30 seconds to consider your options .
shut it off ! .
you kill me , they kill you , your brother dies anyway .
you lie , you accept the job , you take your brother , you run .
i hunt you down , i kill you , i kill your brother ... and i kill your mother for the aggravation you' ve caused me .
you accept the deal , you steal some cars , you make some money ... and you be a big brother .
memphis !
8 : 00 a . m .
friday morning .
the cars are on the boat , or your brother' s in the coffkn .
get me out of here !
somebody get me out of here !
listen , you don' t really have to make me anything .
oh , hey , you come down here , you save my ass , it' s the least i can do .
hey , i heard you were pumpin ' gas someplace up north or somethin ' , right ?
yeah , i' m workin ' with kids .

you play shadow games and shit .
we' re on a truncated timetable .
otto , i' m sorry .
c can you just listen to me for one second ?
all right ?
we' ve heard you , kip .
shadow games .
but what you have to understand is that if you play shadow games ... by the second night the heat is onto you .
with a one night boost , by the time the fkrst car is reported stolen , your ship sets sail ; it' s a surprise attack .
this is a complicated list , fellas .
it really is .
okay ?
there are 25 that aren' t a problem , but these exotics are tough to fknd .
and the new mercedes , they require laser cut keys .
okay ?
uh , yeah , i got that covered .
you have that covered ?
what' d i just say ?
yeah , i got it covered .
yeah .
yeah .
all right , all right .
well , then , let' s get to work .
toby , hack into the insurance database and fknd as many cars as you can .
yes !
i got addresses on hillary , natalie and tracy .
donny , check the dmv for the remaining cars on the list .
i' m sorry , miss , but you' ve missed fkve questions .

perhaps , mmm .
but you know , this is the one .
yes , yes , yes .
i saw three of these parked outside the local starbucks this morning , which tells me only one thing there' s too many self indulgent wieners in this city with too much bloody money !
now , if i was driving a 1 967 27 5 gtb four cam
you would not be a self indulgent wiener , sir .
you would be a connoisseur .
precisely .
champagne would fall from the heavens .
doors would open .
velvet ropes would part .
i don' t have one here .
however , i do have one in the warehouse .
superb .
what else do you have in the warehouse ?
mm hmm .
