i want you to talk about women .
mr. crown ?
i' m sorry .
women .
you' ve yet to talk about women .
i enjoy women .
enjoyment isn' t intimacy .
intimacy isn' t necessarily enjoyment .
how would you know ?
has it occurred to you that you have a problem with trust ?
i trust myself implicitly .
yes , but can other people trust you ?
you mean society at large ?
i mean women , mr. crown .
yes , a woman could trust me .
good .
under what extraordinary circumstances would you allow that to happen ?
a woman could trust me ... as long as her interests didn' t run too contrary to my own .
on society at large ... if its interests were to run counter to your own ?
jimmy , i think i' il walk for a while .
i' il meet you at the office .
you want me to take your briefcase ?
no , i' il carry it .
whoa !
jesus christ !
look at this jerk .

you' re an odd duck .
everybody else goes right for the monet .
it' s very nice .
nice ?
do you know what it' s worth ?
i just like my haystacks .
yo , you gonna move it ?
come on , buddy .
let' s go .

jesus christ .

something' s screwed up .
my list says some kind of sarcophagus .
what do you want me to do ?
it' s a horse .
you want i should take it back and dump it ?
just unload the damn thing .
boy , it' s gonna be hot today .
good morning , mr. crown .

you forgot your briefcase , right ?
i must' ve left it here last night .
we have a disparity here .
i saw that .
well , we can' t leave it here .
let' s find out what the problem is .
that is not a sarcophagus .
it' s friday .
what did he mean by that ?
i' d say come monday there' s gonna be hell to pay .
deuce !
times in this thing i never thought i' d see that .
thomas crown forced to sell something .
so what do you think ?
you don' t have any regrets about the way you played this ?
regret is usually a waste of time .
as is gloating .
have you figured out what you' re gonna say to your board ... when they learned that you paid me 30 million more than others were offering ?
good morning , gentlemen .
all right , english only from now on .
gentlemen , upon closer inspection ... your proposal is not as generous as you led us to believe .
there is no mention of executive compensation .
look , gentlemen , we understand your objection to the merger .
it' s not a merger !
your stockholders have spoken .
the stock price was manipulated .
we' ve anticipated your reluctance .
we won' t be a crown subsidiary .
our attorneys are prepared ... to go head to head with you at the sec .
i thought that kid would bust a gut when you went into that thing about sec .
that was brilliant !
how' s it go ?
it' s sad to see another tired man
lay down his hand and quit the holy game of poker .
that' s the line , danny .
he' s right , you know .
third generation company , you think they would have shown more grit .
don' t forget about the douglaston conference call in ten minutes .
speak to scully .
miso soup , daria .
on its way .
go , go , go !
this painting is considered to be the first lmpressionist work in history .
it started the lmpressionist movement .
it influenced major artists who went on to found the first major school ... or style of the 20th century .
okay .
try this .
it' s worth a hundred million bucks .
and the government guy we paid off to make the state deal is back .
no , this is the second time they lied .
screw ' em .
daniel , you had turkey .
mr. schmidt called from ubs .
says there' s an opening for the board .
douglaston conference call , 10 minutes .
young lady ... do not touch .
i' il let you go this time .
on your way .
jimmy , would you take a look in the compressor room ?
there' s something wonky with the a. c.
can' t we pass it on to engineering ?
the book says we check it first .
all right .
it would be one of the hottest days of the year .
can you believe it' s nearly october ?
why don' t you bring the kids ?
are you kidding ?
you know how she is .
she' d probably run to court saying i was endangering them .
you' re not kiddin ' ?
you wouldn' t believe the shit the woman deals out .
the whole air conditioning plant' s crapped out .
why didn' t they call maintenance ?

i set out a bottle of wine .
thank you .
i may have won a cruise .
mikey .
they find the chopper ?
abandoned in queens .
we know where it was stolen ?
checking .
maybe a pad in the hamptons .
mr. lenox .
mr. lenox is the director of the museum .
this is detective michael mccann .
sorry to be here , sir .
who are the actors ?
four , all foreign .
probably eastern european .
no print records .
illegals .
check with lnterpol .
russian government might help .
in the works .
point of entry was a hollow statue delivered this morning .
they brought it in through their own security .
next you' re gonna tell me it was a horse .
a trojan horse ?
bingo .
somebody' s got a sense of humor .
we got three digits of the truck plate .
this place been hit before ?
they just lost their cherry .
i gather it was just the one painting ?
but it' s such an important one .
it' s a seminal work , a historical watershed .
it' s truly irreplaceable .
i love this neighborhood .
some of these broads are wearing my salary .
so the skylight was rigged to blow ?
yeah .
and there were cargo nets spread out ready to use .
and they were wearing rappelling harnesses underneath their clothes .
let' s just track this thing through .
so , they kill the air ... make the place uncomfortable , drive out the tourists , right ?
then they lower these gates so nobody can get in to disturb them .
then they lower the paintings into the cargo nets .
pull the paintings , ditch the frames .
figure they' re gonna fly out of here like a road company of peter pan .
but somebody makes them early .
chopper takes off .
some of the crew make it , some of them don' t .
basically , amateur night , right ?
what' s that ?
it was wedged under the gate .
and ?
not exactly samsonite .
titanium .
the engineer said that it' d have to absorb ... 15 to 20 tons to stop this gate .
seems there may be a couple of holes in your theory .
they shut off the air to drive out the tourists ... then they escort them out anyway ?
then they close the gates to keep everybody out ... but block one of them open while they prepare to load conservatively ... a thousand pounds of paintings and 800 pounds of men ... that we know about , in a
what was the chopper model ?
sikorsky s 76 .
right .
in a chopper with a 600 pound useful load .
you figure you' il wrap this by morning , do you , lieutenant ?
it' s detective .
and i' m a little fuzzy about who you are .
i' m sorry .
i' m catherine banning .
of ?
zurich underwriters requested well , actually
you' re insurance .
so , i' m stuck with you on my back .
come on , lieutenant .
who knows ?
you might enjoy it .
thousand bucks says you can' t do that again .
tony , put another ball down there .
tommy , it was a figure of speech .
let' s make it interesting , shall we ?
ten to one ?
fine .
i' il take your money .
let' s go again .
still ten to one .
that' s $100, 000 on a goddamn golf swing .
it' s a beautiful saturday morning , john .
what the hell else do we gotta do ?
she does live in europe but she' s actually from the midwest .
born catherine olds .
who' s banning ?
some englishman she married for six months .
so she' s not law enforcement .
worse .
bail bonds and bounties .
whoa , tough people .
her father' s an ohio hardcase , clarence milton olds , called bumper olds .
story goes he kept a chain on his back bumper .
a guy ran on him once , he brought him back on the end of the chain .
guess you don' t wanna cross old clarence .
good morning .
how are you ?
i said , how are you ?
jet lagged .
thank you .
we thought we' d start with the security tapes .
what is that ?
you don' t wanna know .
all right .
these are yesterday' s tapes from the lmpressionist wing .
why are they different from the corridor cameras ?
we' re upgrading to thermal imagery .
so far , it' s just the high value areas .
but it works in the dark .
even senses body heat .
got it .
so that' s the monet that morning .
right .
skip forward to the robbery .
time of the robbery .
whoa .
zip .
was the camera still working , or what , did they cut the feed ?
that' s why they cut the air .
you know , that could be .
these things need a ten degree difference .
if the temperature of the ambient gets within ten degrees of the bodies
then the camera can' t tell between people and walls .
how hot did it get in the museum ?
check the other cameras .
so why can you see people in this room ?
the ambient in that room only went up to the mid 80s .
wait a minute .
you' re telling me that for some reason ... the area around that particular painting went above 90 ?
what ?
i don' t know .
something .
what , are we channeling now ?
how long you been doing this ?
a while .
where ? ln europe ?
and other places .
you' re a real self promoter .
give me a for instance .
how many legs ?
what ?
the bench .
two .
you still have that tape up ?
great .
back it up to the morning part of the tape .
stop .
hello .
jesus .
so they bring this thing in earlier in the day .
what' s in it ?
it could be a heater .
what ?
in the briefcase , on a timer .
bring the temperature up ten more degrees .
you ever eat ?
lunch , for instance ?
you like pizza ?
i know a great place we could stop .
i' m on london time .
and pizza' s not your thing .
what' s the matter , lieutenant ?
did she leave you for a stockbroker ?
it' s detective , first grade .
and he was a urologist .
can i drop you someplace ?
at your hotel ?
one , i keep an apartment here , and two , i' m going to your office .
she keeps an apartment .
i keep goldfish .
hello there , little lady .
how are you doing ?
detective .
they don' t seem to be russian .
tadross thinks maybe romanian .
the witness is here .
right .
come on in .
number four .
you' re sure ?
i' m sure .
would you mind indicating that here ?
certainly .
just check it off .
and if you could sign down here , please .
these gentlemen will take you out , finish the paperwork .
appreciate it .
thank you very much .
we' re gonna go beat up the romanians .
thank you , thank you .
wait a minute .
i' m gonna go get some coffee .
that sums it up , gentlemen .
and you' d be willing to testify ?
absolutely .
i have to tell you , people like this , they might have friends .
you realize they might try to make it ugly for a witness .
i understand , gentlemen , and i guess i' il take my chances .
we' il nail these jokers .
i can' t imagine somebody thinking they' d get away with a thing like this .
they say anything yet ?
not in english .
they' re still trying to find somebody to translate .
let me try .
do not tell me you speak romanian .
god , who would ever bother with romanian ?
give me the quiet one .
they do speak english .
it was a prepackaged robbery .
he picked them up in little odessa .
they were given timetables , electrical
who' s " he " ?
you don' t think they know , do you ?
i mean , there were intermediaries .
they never saw his face or heard his voice .
one time hires .
that' s why they failed .
what makes you think they failed ?
oh , maybe it was a successful robbery .
maybe they were set up to fail .
why ?
diversion .
make a lot of noise over there ... so over here in this room you can take a hundred million off the wall ... and waltz right out the front door .
oh , that' s good .
doesn' t matter .
as soon as he tries to sell it , we nail him .
he' s not gonna sell .
he' s not ?
mm mm .
this is an elegant crime ... done by an elegant person .
it' s not about the money .
okay .
so who' s gonna risk prison to steal a monet ... just to not sell it ?
a monet lover .
whose desk is that ?
could i use it ?
yeah .
sure .
okay .
let' s dig up every major auction in the last five years ... and see who' s been bidding on monets .
see anyone we know ?
him ?
a big day for this guy is taking off his tie .
he' s a finance geek .
is he ?
how' s that ?
yeah !
go , go !
ease up .
whoa .
come on !
get ' em up .
get it !
let' s go !
i saw him wreck a $100, 000 boat because he liked the splash .
do you have any idea what kind of flesh eating lawyers this guy has ?
hmm ?
mm hmm .
not to mention political connections .
mr. thomas crown has very generously loaned us ... a pissarro until our own monet is restored to us .
not to mention personally apprehending one of the suspects .
come on !
i' m afraid jim embellishes horrendously .
i just did what jim does at these fund raisers .
i waved my arms in the air ... and shrieked for help .
hello , gloria .
how are you ?
lovely to see you .
you' re well ?
i knew him , you know .
did you , madam ?
his son , that is .
lucien pissarro in the ' 30s in paris .
it' s very impressive .
well , it seemed the right size for the space .
or maybe you were bored with it .
do we know each other ?
not yet .
i' m catherine banning .
thomas crown .
vodka rocks , twist .
okay .
and scotch neat .
how did you know that ?
i' ve been reading about you .
oh ?
where ?
in a file .
who do you work for ?
i' m in the art world .
dealer ?
mm mm .
gallery owner ?
no , it' s closer to insurance .
i' m covered .
not for this .
the painting ?
the monet ?
you don' t think they' d simply cut a check for a hundred million dollars ... do you ?
so you  get them things .
when it' s this much money involved , it usually means i get them someone' s head .
and whose head are you after ?
yours .
good evening , mr. crown .
are you trying to
are you trying to imply that i had something to do with that painting ?
trying ?
thank you .
no , i wouldn' t call it an attempt .
what' s your take from this ?
five percent of the value recovered .
oh .
a bounty hunter .
if you like .
always get your man ?
mm hmm .
think you' il get me ?
oh , i hope so .
can i drop you somewhere ?
i have a car here .
thanks .
then tomorrow ?

you' re on .
let' s make it early .
we' ve got a stop to make first .
what' s happened ?
happened ?
whenever i talk while you' re tuning out what i say ... the corners of your mouth go up .
you' re enjoying something .
it' s not me .
what is it ?
an entertainment .
very little entertains you .
so i can easily guess .
a worthy adversary ?
did someone swindle you ?
you waltz in there without even a heads up ... without one word to me or anyone else in the department .
i had a little chat with him , yes .
you had a little chat .
you told him balls out he was a suspect .
i cut through the crap .
how long was it gonna take you , mike ?
weeks of wire taps , if you could get them .
guys tailing him to the bathroom .
i found out in ten minutes .
he did it .
the smug son of a bitch did it .
you compromised the investigation .
no , i jump started it .
oh , really ?
what do you have to show for it , besides a date ?
the man likes the high wire .
i' m gonna play with him for a while .
well , i think there' s some question as to who' s playing whom .
you saying i shouldn' t go ?
don' t piss on the department , okay ?
we' re on this .
how do you do ?
this is a warrant .
we' re here to conduct a legal search of these premises .
i' d let us .
jack , give me two men up here .
i want two more men in this room here .
let' s go .
move , move .
come on .
let' s go .
john , take the back room .
you want help in here ?
mr. crown .
thank you .
excuse me ?
why are you in my house ?
i' m sure it' s a mystery to you , but your lawyer will be able to explain .
wallace ?
this gentleman happens to be my attorney .
keep your knickers on .
i' il get into his house .
you look wonderful .
thank you .
how are you ?
popular .
mikey .

it' s kinda sweet .
you know , for a first date .
huh ?
hey , i didn' t know your portrait was here .
the faceless businessman in a bowler hat .
everything but the briefcase .
did you have to sit long for the artist ?
actually , i do own a copy of that .
oh , of course you do .
and where might you be taking me ?
come , come , come , come .
good evening , sir .
the museum is closing in 15 minutes .
thank you .
your loaner .
that' s the least i could do .
i see they got the air back on .
i shouldn' t have checked my coat .
well , thank you .
you know , if i had my pick in this room ...
i wouldn' t have taken the monet .
no ?
no .
what would you take ?
for my personal choice ?
that one .
you ?
you' d like to have that ?
why ?
will you get it for me ?
anything' s obtainable .
okay , i' il bite .
what would you do to get it ?
i' d buy a print .
it looks like they' re going into cipriani .

i' m watching them walk into cipriani .
and with no reservation .

we have krug grand cuvee 1981 .
sounds great .
thank you .
wonderful .
on the way .
you' ve been busy .
i' m sure your files are thicker than mine .
the thing that impressed me most ... was getting from glasgow to oxford on a boxing scholarship .
not bad for a wee lad from " glasgee .
it was easy .
rich kids can' t box .
the hard part was learning to talk .
but you , now .
the matador ?
the ltalian industrialist ?
the ambassador' s son ?
he was cute .
he was 17 .
yes , he was .
i must admit , that' s a fair litany for a young girl from lima , ohio .
but the part i didn' t get i mean , it' s obvious that you like men ... but you never keep any of them around very long either .
oh , well , men make women messy .
thank you .
here' s to the fear of being trapped .
here' s the fish for the lady .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
and the lamb chops for the gentleman .
thank you .
we' d like to pre order souffles .
and i' d like to send a bottle of burgundy to those two gentlemen .
of course , sir .

i' m under glass .
soon you' il know everything about me .
there are things we don' t know .
like what ?

were you bored ?
acquisitions and mergers looking a little stodgy ?
is it more fun getting it than keeping it ?
is this the fun part for you ?
how do you mean ?
it' s not about the money .
you like the chase .
not many women get to chase .
it' s like poker .
we don' t let you in the game .
you' re right .
my brothers said i didn' t have the mind for it .
and now they' re plumbers .
oh , but you knew that .
hmm .

that' s as good as it gets .
oh .
excuse me .
may i ask you a very personal question ?
oh , sure .
by all means .
do you really think i' m going to sleep with a man i' m investigating , hmm ?
is that the question ?
yes , that' s it .

i' d be hugely disappointed if you did .
how do porcupines mate ?
old joke .

it' s beautiful !
wanna see it ?
are you sure ?
i' m sure .
would you like a splash ?
come here .
wanna see it ?
you sure ?
you think i believe you' d leave your hard stolen painting lying around a hut ?
what if i did ?
and that you' d tell me ?
what if i trust you ?
you know you can' t .
you don' t believe it' s possible that you could ever trust me , do you ?
you know how likely i think that is ?
excuse me .
should i open another bottle ?
yes .
i think so .
i think so .
the ' 85 wasn' t very good .
no , it' s it' s not at all .
truce .
a truce would be good .
that' d be great .
that' d be good .
what was it ?
it' s a nice little renoir .
oh .
renoir .
nice little copy ?
we' il never know , will we ?
okay , i give up !
easy , easy .
think i' il get that bottle .
oh , yeah .
that would be good .
oh , you' re not boring .
i' il give you that .
you' ve complimented me .
how ?
they were bankers .
who ?
who ?
the suits .
you' re transferring assets , getting ready to run .
and suppose i did run ?
then what would you have ?
suppose i gave you ten .
to fail ?
how would i hide it ?
i' d teach you .
you really think there' s happy ever after for people like us ?
so just how big of a thief are you ?
well , if you count wall street ... pretty big .
if you mean art ...
i' m just an amateur .
beginner' s luck , huh ?
gentleman jockey wins the derby .
something like that .
well , you got your hand caught in the cookie jar now .
how are you gonna get out of it ?
it' s just a game , love .
just a game .
nice tan .
thanks .
went to the beach a couple days .
on the job ?
that' s right .
and did you pick anything up ?
he' s got an ornament worn by frederick barbarossa at his coronation in 1152 .
really ?
stolen ?
so , that' s it , huh , after two days and two nights ?
that was it .
would you like to know where he was the night before he left ?
or after he left you last night ?
not really .
okay , suit yourself .
she' s ...
striking .
he seems to think so .
three dates in six days .
where does he find the time ?
you okay ?
you know , i was okay once .
my girlfriend got drunk .
stayed out all night , came back in the morning married .
i told people i didn' t care ... and then i fucked five women in three days ... flipped my car on an on ramp ... beat a suspect unconscious , got suspended .
but i was okay .
is there a point to this story ?
they both had to come out of the same building .
what' s this ?
photos of the borders of the monet .
the borders ?
before insurers indemnify a painting ... they remove it from the frame and photograph the borders .
borders are never seen in galleries or auctions , so if a picture is stolen ... and someone tries to pass off a forgery , the borders won' t match .
and if the borders do happen to match ?
then the forger was in the presence of the original painting .
so , if crown' s prank monet happens to be too good
then we find the forger and nail the bastard .
how long have you had these ?
five days .
and you didn' t open them ?
yeah , well , they' re open now .
it' s beautiful .
you' re not gonna say ...
i couldn' t possibly " ?
i wouldn' t say anything that boring .
she' s an old friend , but it' il be like having dinner at a morgue .
you know , it occurred to me , i might be able to bear it if you came with me .
tomorrow ?
that' s so soon .
i sense hesitation .
do you find my company monotonous ?
because i' d hate to think you could .
what , be bored by you ?
require a little variety ?
you' re referring to anna .
they photographed me with anna .
you know , that' s your prerogative .
i thought they were .
i let it happen .
you wanna know why ?
i' il tell you why .
i don' t want to know why .
i wanna tell you .
you know what ?
i don' t wanna know why .
jimmy , i' d like to get out .
jimmy , keep driving .
i don' t wanna know why !
just let me tell you why !
now ask me why !
i don' t wanna know !
you' re upset about it .
yeah , because that' s what you wanted .
i needed you to be upset .
he' s sadistic .
who knew ?
did it occur to you i needed to know ?
know what ?
know whether all it was to you was the painting .
how else could i know ?
what about you ?
i can leave here tomorrow .
so can you .
we' d be fugitives .
fugitives with means .
all the difference in the world .
i don' t know .
oh , dear .
peter pan decides to grow up and finds there' s no place to land .
the only sad part is ... if she' s anything like you ... she won' t know what she' s lost until it' s gone .
hey , let' s go .
where ?
the painting' s borders match perfectly .
then again , i' m sure you knew that , didn' t you ?
come on .
let' s go meet some forgers .
i was never an lmpressionist .
anyway , i pay taxes now .
doing what ?
portraits .
inserting the rich into old masterpieces .
the wife' s face on the mona lisa .
from brooklyn to greenwich in one generation ... you gotta have the paintings to match .
so , who did it ?
the german .
heinrich
knutzhorn .
art' s a small world , michael .
so who do you think did this ?
frederick golchan .
he said you did .
so you think if i want paint , it just comes fedex ... and the guards just think it' s therapy ... while i madly copy a monet in my cell from the original ?
what ?
what ?
nothin ' .
i was just wondering about what he wouldn' t say .
give .
there' s nothing .
you know what ?
life is full of shitty conflicts , okay ?
give .
i just wondered if there was a connection between them , that' s all .
between crown and that old man ?
you are spooky .
you are really spooky .
they owned a gallery together crown and knutzhorn .
in berlin , 1990 .
and another one in hamburg and one in paris in ' 94 .
you notice the one man show in paris in ' 95 ?
the artist is knutzhorn .
so ?
so look at the first name .
tyrol knutzhorn .
yeah , we spoke to a heinrich .
you know what it was ?
the way he smiled at the painting ?
pride .
paternal pride .
i bet you it' s his son .
son of a great forger ... who paints as well as dad .
just hasn' t been caught yet .
well , i assume if you look ... you' il find tyrol knutzhorn lives in new york .
you know what ? l
i owe you an apology .
i didn' t think you had the chops to see this through .
well , you don' t know me .
yeah , but i should have .
i bet you' d stand at the pearly gates and kick st. peter right in the teeth ... before you' d let somebody play you .
harold , listen carefully .
please , don' t interrupt .
if i had to be gone , and i mean seriously gone , in about eight hours ... how much could i take with me ?
are you all right ?
you' il be taking an enormous loss , if you liquidate like this .
understand ?
i understand that , and that can' t be helped .
but what could i leave with ?
call me back in an hour , i' il have a number for you of some kind .
leavin ' us ?
no , you' re not that lucky .
i' m organizing .
no knutzhorn' s ever been to see the old man .
there was a knudsen , though , three times last month .
you think that' s just a coincidence ?
could be .
probably is .
look , here' s an extra hundred .
just go , go !
is he here ?
he' s in a meeting .
it' s very important .
wait in the living room .
i' il get him .
ma' am , wait .
i know we have a plug adaptor .
i saw it .
i just can' t find the bloody plug adaptor .
would you go downstairs and
well , we seem to have backtracked .
take your hands off me !
what do you have that' s fresh ?
like who that girl is and why she' s here always
anna works for me .
oh , you never thought i was a fool before .
she' s here because i owe her money and i wanted to pay her before i go .
really ?
and what is it she does for you ?
i would be compromising her to say .
oh , tommy , you' re going away together .
no , i' m going with you .
of all the things in the world to take with a leap of faith .
how can i possibly trust you ?
i' m not gonna ask that .
i' m gonna trust you .
isn' t that what you wanted , my trust ?
tomorrow afternoon ...
i' il put the monet back .
where ?
hanging back on the wall in the museum ?
you know , tommy , i' m all checkmated out .
if the painting' s back , we' re free of it all .
we' re only for each other .
back on the wall in the museum ?
and you' il meet me at 4 : 00 ... at the wall street heliport and we' il leave together .
or
or you can have them at the museum waiting for me .
i' m trusting you .
i can' t .
i can' t do that !
damn you , you son of a bitch !
get away !
i need to talk to you .
you' re in the lobby , right ?
yeah , mikey , i' m here .
me and about 30 other guys .
let up on yourself .
you did the right thing .
assuming the son of a bitch shows up .
mark , stay with the car .
get a uniformed man on the fire escape .
got it .
detective .
goddamn it !
she leave anything behind ?
just stake out the whole place .
maybe she' il come back again .
is jack there ?
put jack on the phone .
get jack .
what ?
forger .
you didn' t think we just dropped that , did you ?
jack ran it down this morning .
it was a daughter , not a son , and she was under our noses the whole time .
tyrol anna knudsen knutzhorn .
whatever .
crown' s known her since she was ten .
when her father went to jail , crown became her guardian .
put her through college , for christ' s sake .
now she works for one of his companies .
jack , here' s what i want you to do .
he' s in .
got him .
i' il call you back .
that' s him .
overcoat and briefcase .
yeah , mikey , we got him .
center entrance .
grey overcoat .
bring up the lobby on the big monitor .
move in quietly .
we don' t wanna make a scene .
what the hell' s he doin ' ?
it' s almost like he wants to make sure we see him .
let' s play ball .
there he goes .
bowler hat .
move in and pick him up .
go .
move it .
quietly .
excuse me .
excuse me .
shit , he switched the painting .
stay with the painting .
what ?
i can' t
shit !
there' s another one .
where is he ?
what the hell
there' s guys with bowler hats  all over the goddamn place .
did you warn him ?
what ?
no .
no !
then he knew you were gonna betray him .
shit .
they' re going for the stairs .
that does it .
now we got four floors to keep track of .
stay with him .
he disappears , it' il be ten years before he surfaces again .
is the lmpressionist wing sealed off ?
completely .
there' s no way to get in ?
gates are down .
we got men on the roof .
if he tries to put the painting back , i guarantee it won' t be in that room .
got ' em coming out of the woodworks .
what' s the deal ?
he' s going the other way .
what ?
where are you ?
i can' t hear you .
this is ridiculous .
he' s got us running around in circles .
paretti' s trying to reach you .
i know , you' re fucked .
i' m coming down .
what do we do ?
start arresting people .
come on .
excuse me , sir .
one moment .
shit !
i knew it .
excuse me .
coming through .
get the civilians out of here .
how do we get this gate open ?
kill the sprinklers in the lmpressionist wing now !
it' s water paint .
it' s been here the whole time .
from what , one , two days after the robbery ?
there' s something jammed in the track .
returned the damn thing practically as soon as he stole it .
oh , lord .
oh , dear .
this this can' t be .
it simply can' t be .
now , how the hell did he do that ?
where are you goin ' ?
oh , office .
write up my report .
the job' s done , right ?
yeah .
so , the other painting , why do you think he chose that particular one ?
i have no idea .
but it' s not insured by my people , so i' m out of it .
obviously , you' il still have to pursue it .
i don' t really give a shit .
you don' t care if you catch him ?
i' il do what they tell me to do .
did you ever care ?
yeah .
he pissed me off .
but look , the week before i met you ...
i nailed two crooked real estate agents ... and a guy who was beating his kids to death .
so , if some houdini wants to snatch a couple swirls of paint ... that are really only important to some very silly rich people ...
i don' t really give a damn .
you' re a good man .
okay .
get out of here .
and tell him i said hello .
i have no idea what you' re talking about .
go on .
and don' t stiff us for your phone bills .
taxi !
you know , i' m just gonna run .
thanks .
excuse me .
you can' t go out there without an escort .
you would be catherine ?
he wanted you to have this .
good day , ma' am .
how can i help you ?
i have a reservation .
okay , miss banning .
will you be carrying any luggage today ?
can you see that this ...
gets to this man at police headquarters ?
this should take care of it .
it won' t get there till the morning .
that' s fine .
departures for international flights are up the escalator to your left .
ma' am ... is everything all right ?
everything' s fine .
you don' t need to cry there , lassie .
did you set this up ?
did you set this up ?
miss , please , the seat belt sign is still on .
i' il tell you what .

i' il break both your arms .
