thank you .
all right , everybody , that' s it for the day .
be sure you get that drop cloth up before you leave , all right ?
that' s some nice work , young blood .
thank you , mr. roulette .
yeah , your daddy taught you right .
you know , when all the construction starts coming back ... you got skills to make something of yourself .
thank you , sir .
that' s fine .
i can wait until payday .
i' m sorry , all the others have families to feed ... but you do good work .
i like what you do , okay ?
okay .
you got a funny way of telling me that .
morning .
didn' t i tell you i could pull some strings ?
yes , you did , charlie .
thank you , you' re a good man .
yeah .
but tell me why ....
morning .
why would a doctor want to hire a carpenter ?
because it ain' t nothing but scud work anyway .
you ain' t gonna like it .
you say the pay is $12 a week ?
yeah .
i' m liking it already .
all right , then .
dr. blalock , this is vivien thomas .
vivien ?
that' s a girl' s name .
yes , my mother was so sure she was having a girl ... that she picked the name early , and kept it .
you don' t say .
i' m pleased to meet you , sir .
call me doctor , and , francis , you can tell this good doctor ... that his theories are extremely interesting , and i' il be praying for him .
yes , doctor .
though it' s his patients i should be praying for .
keep up , son .
this is where my work is done .
what is your work ?
medical research .
we push the limits of surgery ... using stray dogs we get from the local dog catch .
they' re darling , but don' t get too attached .
they' re a means to a great end .
the dog pens get cleaned up twice a day .
i need the lab swept every morning .
simple tasks , but they proved beyond the abilities of your predecessors .
do you think you can handle it ?
so ?
so what ?
don' t " so what " me .
did you get it ?
you got it .
you must have got it .
it' s working at a hospital , right ?
yeah .
i' m so glad .
everyone' s gonna see how smart you are .
i don' t know how smart you have to be to shovel .
the guy i' m working for , he seemed kind of eccentric ... but he is a doctor , yeah .
that' s right , he is a doctor .
so you just keep your eyes open .
we can get married now .
yeah .
do everything just like we laid it out .
doctor ... and mrs. thomas .
vivien .
good morning , sir .
you said you were a carpenter ?
yes .
did you go to high school ?
yes , i did .
got my diploma .
planning on going to tennessee state next year ... to study medicine , be a doctor .
unusual ambition for a carpenter .
i always wanted to be one since i was a kid .
i almost saved up enough money for college ... and then slowdown hit .
those are van slyke gas manometers over there .
so you can handle a saw ?
yeah , since i was 12 .
do tell .
for cutting the lines , my father would measure on the lumber , sir .
call me doctor .
so your daddy' s a carpenter , too ?
what does he think of your ambition ?
he' s always known i had my mind set on it .
those apparatus on the workbench , what are they called ?
van slyke gas manometers , sir , doctor .
they are , indeed .
vanderbilt may be a podunk institution , but i' m gonna put it on the medical map .
i' m working on traumatic shock .
damn thing kills thousands of people every year ... and doctors don' t know what the hell to do about it .
let me see those hands .
pick that up .
now the left hand .
good .
excuse me , vivien .
dr. blalock wanted you to have this .
thank you .
good night .
you know what my grandfather did ?
it doesn' t have anything to do with me going out on strike .
i said , " do you know what my grandfather did ?
yes .
he picked cotton in mississippi , you told me a hundred times .
my grandfather was a piece of property .
no better than that chair or table over there .
his son became a free man at the age of 15 .
he raised me with hardly an elementary school education .
now i see my son graduate college and go on to teach school .
so don' t tell me things don' t get better over time .
things don' t just get better .
people got to change things , pop , make them better .
lf i don' t do something now , i' il be a dead man ... before i get paid like white teachers do .
vivien , you know i' m right about this .
all right , now , harold , just hold your head .
i got reading to do .
to anesthetize brutus , first we have to calculate the weight .
he weighs 18 . 4 kilograms .
and it should take 552 milligrams of sodium barbital ... to anesthetize him for three hours if the absorption rate is uniform .
dogs ?
what kind of doctor is he ?
dogs ?
what kind of doctor is he ?
when you practice on dogs , and then you can help heal people .
gives me the willies .
it' s not that bad .
i mean , you look inside , you see all the colors ... all the pinks and blues , reds .
it' s beautiful , clara .
that' s where life comes from .
what' s this ?
what' s this ?
open up .
excuse me , sir .
what' s going on here ?
the bank is closed .
closed ?
yup .
open up .
open this door !
somebody got to see somebody in there .
open up , it' s 10 : 00 .
i got to get to work .
let' s go , vivien , we' il come back later .
no , clara , something' s wrong .
it can' t be closed .
excuse me .
excuse me , sir .
hello .
get away from that window , we' re closed .
but i have my money in there .
i need to get my money out .
i can' t get your money back for you .
why not ?
tell me why not .
go on home , son .
the bank has failed .
sir , that' s all my savings .
i had my money for school in there .
they got my money in there .
sir , that' s my money for college .
your money' s gone .
gone ?
but what are they talking about ?
they talking about , it' s gone , ma .
we' il all just have to start over .
can' t fight it now , it' s done .
it just feels so wrong .
took me seven years to save that money .
you' re not the only one who had money in that bank .
it' s done , it' s over with !
we still got each other , viv .
yeah , we got each other .
that' s all poor people ever have is each other .
there' s no cut down the cannula , the femoral vein .
i showed you how to do it .
i figured out a way to give it barbital intravenously .
where you putting it ?
ln the forepaw .
the manometer .
it' s all set up , doctor .
good .
you can begin the incision .
i' m not ready for that .
i say you' re ready , you' re ready .
i' il mark out the line .
and you cut along it .
just like you did for your old daddy .
like this ?
just like that .
keep your hand taut .
why are we making the incision here ?
to gain access to the pulmonary artery .
and how will we find it , vivien ?
it' s the artery leading to the lungs from the right side of the heart .
not bad .
now the rib spreader .
and why are we gonna damage poor brutus ' greater vessels ?
to induce traumatic shock , to study it .
watch this manometer .
and imagine that brutus is a 16 year old boy ... just fell out of a tree saving his mom' s cat .
he' s broken four ribs , he' s concussed .
dad' s rushed him to er .
but he' s gone into shock .
his blood pressure' s way down .
his vital signs almost nonexistent .
can we save him ?
not if i use present methods of treatment .
see , conventional wisdom says i should constrict the vessels .
i beg to differ .
let' s break their rules .
use my rules .
body needs blood .
let' s give it some .
how' s that gauge ?
still falling .
maybe the experts are right .
maybe i' m wrong .
maybe i' il kill this boy and break his mother' s heart .
it' s rising .
that' s life coming back .
how' s that make you feel ?
good .
very good , doctor .
let' s look at the record of our work .
where' s the smoke drum ?
i' m sorry ?
the smoke drums .
you didn' t set the smoke drums ?
what is a smoke drum ?
that' s a smoke drum .
what the fuck is wrong with you ?
i record all the information i need for my research on a smoke drum .
i did not know that .
ls nobody listening to me ?
god damn it !
i have to do everything myself .
a whole day' s work goes down the toilet , and i have to start all over again .
do you have sawdust or just plain shit for brains ?
where the hell do you think you' re going ?
fine , get out of here .
where the hell do you think you' re going ?
fine , get out of here .
vivien .
jesus .
hold on a minute , will you ?
i was not raised to take that type of talk .
my apologies .
i' m sorry i lost my temper .
normally it takes assistants months to learn what you picked up in a matter of days .
it won' t happen again .
please .
ladies and gentlemen .
fellows , take the music down , will you ?
ladies and gentlemen , thank you .
i mentioned to gen. cunningham the other day ... how proud we were that al had chosen us ... over all the medical schools in the country .
john , why don' t you tell everyone what you said ?
be glad to , walter .
i just got back from a month at the front .
there are thousands of our boys in field hospitals ... all over north africa and ltaly ... who owe their lives to dr. blalock' s work in the treatment of shock .
i want everyone here to know how grateful we are to him ... and how proud you all should be .
hear , hear .
dr. blalock , welcome .
thank you .
thanks , general .
it' s great to have you here , al ... but truth be told , it' s mary we really want .
our new chairman of the department of surgery ... my old and dear friend , dr. alfred blalock .
thank you , walter .
mary and i welcome you all to our home .
as do our dear children .
sadie , get them to bed , now .
no !
thank you , johns hopkins , for my prodigal return ... after 15 years in the tennessee backwoods .
to find myself back here .
dreams do come true .
you' re the best surgeons in the country and i' m honored to lead you .
we' il storm the beaches together .
shoulder to shoulder .
lay siege to the mysteries of medicine .
we' il make the kind of progress hopkins used to be known for .
i know we will accomplish great things together .
i' m looking for my next watershed discovery ... not to put too modest a point on it .
it' s not enough for us to be great surgeons .
we need to be outstanding researchers .
any ideas ?
anything innovative ?
what about skin grafts ?
testing what skin grips might take .
lsn' t skin merely packaging ?
no , it keeps out infection .
excuse me , doctor , may i suggest something ?
please do .
i' m very suggestible .
tell us your name again .
i run the harriet lane clinic for children .
dr. taussig .
yes , of course .
dr. longmire , dr. kelven , dr. cooley .
i' ve read about your research .
on congenitally malformed hearts .
yes .
boy , women and their hearts .
vivien , would you get dr. taussig a drink ?
what would you like ?
champagne would be lovely .
let' s lubricate the vein of inspiration .
go on , dr. taussig , tell us more .
it' s something that up to now has been written off as untreatable .
but i don' t believe it has to be .
i' m speaking of tetralogy of fallot .
blue babies .
yes , these children , their hearts aren' t failing ... they' re suffocating due to a blockage in the main artery to the lung .
pulmonary stenosis .
the mortality rate is 100 % .
i' ve watched hundreds of cyanotic children die .
i admitted a baby tonight who will certainly die ... simply because no one has had the courage ... to attempt a surgical solution to this .
maybe with good reason .
to put it mildly , you can' t operate on the heart .
that' s basic .
we don' t have clinical proof of that  my point exactly .
it' s possible for us  denton , you have to stop the heart ... to perform a complicated correction within three minutes .
by that time , they' re dead .
these children are doomed .
there must be a way to get more blood to the lungs .
i mean , i doubt we could repair a defect in the heart walls
without causing ventricular fibrillation .
but maybe there' s a way to avoid interfering with the greater circulation ....
lf we focus on the pulmonary artery .
who on this god' s earth are you ?
brought home some food from the party .
i' m trying to get her down .
hold on .
okay , girl .
now go to sleep , baby .
the girls are just getting to bed ?
2 ton neighbor upstairs nearly burst through the boards .
i' m gonna have to fix that .
are you gonna fix the fat man ?
get him to stop hollering his head off , when the girls is trying to sleep ?
try a deviled egg .
they' re real good .
seen better in nashville .
i want to go home , viv .
clara , it' s our first week .
yeah , and you said if we didn' t like it , remember ?
yes .
our family' s in nashville .
we had a nice home in a good neighborhood .
the schools were fine .
not living in this ....
i don' t know how we' re gonna make it on that paycheck he' s talking about ... and he got you serving drinks at his party just to make ends meet .
come on .
try to understand .
when i started at vanderbilt ...
i was a janitor .
i know .
dr. blalock saw what i could contribute , and he gave me a chance .
and when they offered him that big job in detroit ... he didn' t take it because they didn' t take me .
now i' m a lab assistant to a top surgeon ... at the number one medical school in the country .
it' s a good position .
what about you going to medical school ?
you don' t have to remind me of that .
we have a family now .
sweetheart , it' s important work .
and it' s a real opportunity , and i love what i' m doing .
so it doesn' t really matter how i feel , then , does it ?
clara , you know it matters .
see that man ?
that' s johns hopkins himself .
sir william osler ... the father of modern american medicine .
william halstead , invented the mastectomy .
let me show you some of the others .
excuse me .
all workers punch in at the rear entrance .
he' s with me .
that don' t make any difference .
do you know who i am ?
no , sir .
dr. blalock , chief surgical professor .
i' m sorry , dr. blalock , but that' s the rules .
i' il meet you in the labs , vivien .
hey , you need to punch in first .
thank you .
i can see we' ve arrived .
when was the last time they used this place ?
have someone clean it up before they put the equipment in .
i' il meet you in an hour at the harriet lane wards .
let' s see if there' s anything in this idea of dr. taussig' s .
excuse me ?
good morning .
where do you think i could find someone to help us clean up the lab , doctor ?
who do you think you' re talking to ?
i' m not sure .
i' m vivien thomas , i work for dr. blalock , running this lab .
i' m dr. edgar v. hecker ...
director of laboratories .
i' d like some coffee and a doughnut .
doctor .
there must be a mix up .
listen , i don' t stand for insolence .
we' il see about this .
you know , doctor , there aren' t many  what ?
you' il have to speak up , i can' t hear too well in this ear .
you' re one of the few women doctors i' ve seen here .
at least they let me in through the front door .
this is where we keep some of the older kids .
doctor , why do they squat like that ?
a little boy told me that it helps him breathe better .
it cuts off the blood to the legs , pushes it up into the lungs .
they both look very cyanotic .
here he is now .
dr. blalock .
welcome .
helen , sorry .
here is the saxon baby i was telling you about last night .
thank you .
she usually smiles when someone does that .
hello , mrs. saxon .
what is that thing ?
it' s an oximeter .
reads how much oxygen there is in the blood .
she looks cold in there .
but i can' t hold her .
they say it isn' t good for her .
i' m not even supposed to let her cry .
how do you keep a baby from crying ?
especially if you can' t hold her .
you can see the change in the shape and the size of the vessels ... as these hearts grow larger .
i did necroscopies on some of my patients ' hearts .
to study the malformations in detail .
it' s amazing they could live at all with hearts like these .
dr. gross at harvard said only god could correct ... a narrowing indentation of the left side of the aortic arch .
perhaps that statement says more about harvard than it does about god .
that baby back there , how long ?
six months .
a year at the very most .
that' s not right .
are you going to take this on , doctor ?
i want to see all your diagnostic notes .
i' il get them right away .
thank you .
put away the books , vivien .
let' s not waste any more time on theoretical crap .
let' s start with experiments .
four separate defects of the heart working in combination .
the pulmonary artery is constricted ... in the main artery before the divide , diminishing blood supply to both lungs .
and the hole in the septum ... causes the used blood to flow back into the arterial system ... instead of flowing through the lungs , turning the babies blue .
a baby' s heart is delicate .
it' s a goddamn minefield .
the first step is to see if we can create the " blue baby " condition in a dog ... and then come up with a plan to solve it .
you' re drinking too much coffee .
balzac drank 300 cups of coffee in one day .
of course , he died of a perforated ulcer .
odds are against us reproducing this in the laboratory .
are you sure this is the limb you want to climb out on ?
back in ' 29 , when i had tb ...
the x rays showed a big gaping hole in my left lung .
i laid there on a freezing porch ... in a sanatorium in upstate new york ... with 18 blankets on me .
nothing but my nose exposed to the elements .
death' s a very humbling thing to live with day in and day out .
i swore then ... if i got my life back , i would do something important with it .
i know , in every fiber of my being ... that this is a limb i want to climb out on .
it' s gonna be hell trying to work with a child' s vessels ... three or four millimeters thick .
like sewing over cooked spaghetti noodles .
we' il need the smallest sutures .
we' il need to make our own tools .
we could be in for trouble , vivien .
big trouble .
<i> dr. alfred blalock to or , please . </ i>
they' re driving me crazy .
this goddamn war .
we don' t have enough doctors .
my surgery cases are through the roof .
we don' t have enough doctors .
my surgery cases are through the roof .
lf i' m not operating , i' m teaching .
you' re gonna have to do most of this research .
what' il you need ?
i need a bulldog clamp small enough for the baby ... but strong enough to stop the flow of blood .
what about a breathing device ?
i' d love a positive pressure respirator , but with this war going on ....
yeah , how in hell can i do the experiments if i can' t even get the equipment ?
shut up .
you surely pissed off ed hecker .
you mean i disturbed his afternoon nap ?
what is it with you and that boy of yours ?
thomas .
why' d you bring him up here ?
we' ve been together more than 12 years .
he' s a really good worker .
how about a little wager ?
$50 ?
give him a break , dick .
you' re on .
there' s a rumor going around you' re contemplating heart surgery .
that' s an intriguing rumor , don' t you think ?
wouldn' t it be a feather in our cap if we were the first ones to do it ?
lndeed , it would .
but i hope you' il forgive my skepticism .
there is no reason for us to think it' s possible .
and every indicator says it can' t be done .
most of us agree , al , the risks are huge .
there isn' t even any incremental progress .
where you see risks , i see opportunity .
you gotta take care of that sink up in 4 b.
you said you were gonna fix these steps .
yes , forgive me , i' ve been very busy at work .
but i will get to it .
the deal is $7 off for odd jobs every month .
you gotta pick up the pace .
<i>with allied forces fighting at cassino ... </ i>
<i>german field marshal kesselring</ i> <i>has earned a reputation as one of our few .... </ i>
this is good , sweetheart .
it' s got some kick to it tonight .
the same as last night .
just put it on a different side of the plate .
sometimes it' s better the next day .
i hope so , ' cause guess what ?
tomorrow it' s hash la king .
it' s hash la queen tonight .
i could get a job .
who' il look after the girls ?
i know it' s not nashville .
and i know ...
i wouldn' t be able to do what i' m doing without you .
my father took care of us , i' il take care of you .
and everything' s gonna be just fine .
we' il be just fine here .
i know , you' re right .
we' il be fine here .
we' re gonna run out of dogs at this rate , vivien .
it' s been three months , and all i' m closer to is retirement .
things move slow sometimes .
no matter what you want .
i' m getting close .
i' ve got 30 % desaturation .
i' m getting close .
i' ve got 30 % desaturation .
that dog was faintly blue at best .
until we get the dog in the same state as the baby , we can' t go forward .
what is the problem ?
every time i constrict , it kills the dogs .
i' ve tried nylon , ligature , umbilical tape , ox facet .
we need a new approach .
okay , forget constriction .
try a partial lobectomy .
remove both lobes of the right lung .
do an arteries to veins fistula , where the medial wall of the aorta ... and the pulmonary artery adhere .
i' il be in the or .
that' s a very good idea , doctor .
thank you .
god damn it !
you did the best you could .
with the condition of his liver , you never had a chance .
i always have a chance .
get me his autopsy .
yes .
shit .
damn .
what' s that ?
our new respirator .
i was rummaging around the machine shop .
it' s not pretty , but it works .
it is pretty .
i knew i could count on you .
you' re the only one i can trust around here .
i suspect others relish the thought of seeing me fail .
mary !
there' s an ambulance in the driveway .
good evening .
there' s an ambulance in the driveway .
good evening .
gen. cunningham needed help carting wounded gl' s off the ship .
so i volunteered to be a driver on the base .
that' s wonderful .
not really .
i' ve a lot of time on my hands .
she wouldn' t go to bed ?
not until you came home .
you know what she said today ?
she said she wanted to be a patient when she grows up .
so she can get to see her daddy .
i don' t remember you wearing a tool belt at your coming out party .
guess it has been ... a couple of weeks since i made it home before 11 : 00 .
no , it' s 23 days .
not as if i don' t know the lot of a doctor' s wife ... but i miss you .
it' s gonna change .
it' s probably gonna get worse .
vivien .
dr. longmire .
ls dr. blalock in ?
no , he' s not .
i don' t know where he is .
you should check his office .
that' s an interesting procedure .
never seen a clamp like that before .
it is for small vascular work .
where' d you get it ?
i pieced it together from some things lying around .
now we' re getting somewhere .
you' re not even looking .
it' s like when you come home late at night , you know ?
you know the feel of the room in the dark .
that looks impossible .
no , if i can do it , you can do it .
you see , this string here ... that' s how you get traction on the suture ...
' cause you need a lot of exposure for the anastomosis .
i' d like to work with you sometime .
fine , dr. longmire , that' d be fine .
my emergency rotation starts in 10 minutes , but i can come in on thursday .
that' d be fine .
you have a good day , doctor .
what are you doing here ?
i was in the neighborhood .
supreme court , finally made it .
a long time .
you been working on this case for what , nine years ?
no , 12 years .
12 years ?
time .
so , tell me , what was it like ?
nine white guys in big gowns walked in first .
then the school board lawyers .
our lawyer , thurgood marshall , he looked kind of lonely in there .
you know what them people said in their brief ?
said since colored teachers in nashville live so cheaply ... they should pay us a whole lot less than white teachers .
but let me tell you ...
thurgood said he' d be goddamned if they could get away with that .
so he gets up and says to that white lawyer , " you' re full of it .
have you ever read the constitution ?
the damned 14th amendment .
the equal protection clause says : " ' a government can' t discriminate based on race . " '
yes , lord .
i mean he was good , viv .
i think we got the board of education on the run .
that' s good news , harold .
so when will they decide ?
could be months , longer .
i don' t know , but i can wait .
after all these years .
all those calls i got in the middle of the night .
white folk telling me they gonna kill me if i don' t drop this lawsuit .
no , you gotta show them you won' t take that treatment .
wait .
listen to me when i tell you , you need to leave this sorry ass place ... and that dead end job .
harold , dr. blalock' s doing the best he can for me .
it' s not enough .
he trusts me to carry out those experiments on my own .
i' m running the whole lab .
thank you .
but does he compensate you extra for that ?
now , harold , vivien' s doing important research now .
but he' s forgetting what granddaddy told us .
he said he regretted acting so grateful for being free ... for what really wasn' t any freedom at all .
i know , i remember .
what you giving him extra for ?
what' s wrong with me ?
nothing minding your own business wouldn' t cure .
you got that white coat .
but you' re just a class three worker , same as me .
ln fact , i got two years ' seniority on you .
i' m making more than you .
don' t think you' re some kind of big shot around here .
excuse me , buddy .
class three , what does that mean ?
it means salary grade .
and , ma' am , and this here ?
what' s this ?
job classification .
what is class three ?
maintenance worker .
i' m a lab technician .
that can' t be .
vivien thomas .
okay .
here we go .
vivien thomas , class three .
thank you .
how' s it going ?
the vessel' s tolerating ligation .
any progress ?
lf you kill that dog , i swear i will take it out of your paycheck .
i' m finished up here .
dr. longmire , would you mind closing up for me ?
thank you .
come on , vivien .
i was kidding about taking it out of your paycheck .
good luck .
' cause i only make $16 a week .
for a 16 hour day .
that' s all they can pay .
that' s all they can pay class three workers around here .
what are you talking about ?
that' s my job classification .
who cares what they call you ?
you and i both know how valuable the work is that you do .
lf my work is so important , then why am i class three ?
two grades below what i do .
ln classification and pay .
i don' t know why .
i don' t pay attention to bureaucratic details .
i see .
look , at hopkins you can' t be a technician without a college degree .
and where are you going ?
i need to fix some steps .
we have work to do .
do i have your permission to do some work for my landlord ... so i can pay my rent ?
dr. blalock , could you come here , please ?
you' re not gonna believe this .
look at the oximeter .
the gums are blue , doctor .
vivien did it .
off , alfred .
i brought him up here ...
i gave him this opportunity .
i don' t set the pay scale .
i just don' t see what more i can do .
you' re probably feeling guilty .
guilty ?
what the hell do i have to feel guilty about ?
for not sending him to college .
you think i should have sent vivien to college ?
sure , why not ?
told me that was his dream .
even mentioned it to me once .
you know i need him in the lab .
i guess there' s only so much good one person can do .
congratulations on the dog .
the kind of raise you' re suggesting , how important is this ?
he makes it possible for me to be in many places at the same time .
can' t you just hire a well trained college kid
no , i can' t .
his hands are important to me .
he' s good at following my instructions , improving on them ... better than anyone i' ve encountered .
you want me to circumvent every administrative regulation ... on behalf of a colored helper ?
walter , i' m close to accomplishing something .
i need him with me so i can continue with my research .
can i count on your help ?
hello , clara .
dr. blalock .
come in , sir .
thank you .
ls vivien at home ?
yes , he' s putting the kids down .
you know , in 13 years , dr. blalock ...
i don' t recall you ever stopping by our house .
i don' t recall ever being invited .
professor .
did something happen ?
yes , i obtained a raise for you , $25 extra a month ... on top of what you' re already making .
that' s $300 for the whole year .
will that be sufficient ?
what job classification ?
surgical technician .
i got you promoted .
promoted .
to what he already does .
excuse me .
you can pay your rent and put all your focus on our research .
vivien , back there in the lab with ponchos , what did you do ?
what you suggested .
a partial fistula .
i stitched the main arteries and veins together , end to end ... and two lobes in the lungs . and two lobes in the lungs .
we created a blue baby' s heart in that dog .
did we ?
now we have our disease model , we can find a cure .
and much as i enjoyed coming here to see you ... would you mind terribly if i got you a telephone ?
no , not at all .
thank you .
a shunt .
i' m sorry , doctor .
what' d you say ?
we need to create a shunt to get more oxygenated blood to the lungs .
can' t see how to do it .
remember back in vanderbilt when we were doing the research ... on how to create high blood pressure in the lungs ?
yes , i connected the subclavian to the pulmonary artery .
we failed to get the higher blood pressure ... but we did get higher blood flow .
which is exactly what dr. taussig said these babies need .
that' s it .
we build a bypass .
take an artery and redirect it .
systemic artery to the pulmonary artery .
through the lungs .
it' s a long way around , but it gets you there .
lf we wait from the right side , we have an advantage there .
but the recurrent nerve is in the way , and if we kink that
vocal cords parallel .
and the carotid' s here .
we may kill the brain if we damage that .
comforting thought .
the subclavian ....
tie it off .
after the divide .
cut it right under the clavicle .
swing it down .
long , slow general arc .
will it hold if we pull it down four inches ?
lf your hands don' t get too excited .
thank you for the vote of confidence .
no one' s ever done anything as hard as this .
changing the course of blood .
it' d turn blue into pink .
and death into life .
i don' t care what the chart says .
this girl wants to live .
retractor .
no , suture .
can' t we try things my way occasionally ?
all right .
sutures .
do you mind if i show you something , doctor ?
thank you .
do you need any help ?
no , that' s fine .
thank you .
i have to purse string the anastomosis .
okay , there .
he' s all yours , doctor .
do you feel the connection ?
are you sure you did this , vivien ?
this is like something the lord made .
look , mr. saxon , mrs. saxon ...
i acknowledge that these are uncharted waters .
there are risks .
but i think we have found a way to repair your daughter' s heart .
how ?
you' re stationed , where , norfolk , is it , mr. saxon ?
yes , sir .
been working on the <i>spencer, </ i> trying to get her back out to sea .
you work on the engines , right ?
yes , sir .
i' d be changing around some of the piping ...
leading to and from your daughter' s heart .
just switching around the pipes ?
yes .
arteries that bring the blood ... to and from the heart to the lungs ... act just like pipes .
i' ve been successful , switching them around .
it' s that easy ?
no , it' s not that easy .
no surgery is ... and this operation has special complications .
but i still think it' s worth doing .
we' re going to talk about this , doctor .
good idea .
it' s going to be a lot harder with a baby .
we' re going to have to collapse one of her lungs .
she' s already so cyanotic .
she' s not getting enough oxygen ... and we' re going to have to take away half of her lung function .
you made those new clamps yet ?
i' m working on it .
what if i shred her insides with those clamps ?
so many ways to fail .
every second counts .
a single minute is too long .
a single minute of poor blood flow to the brain ... a single second of open bleeding ....
<i>are you saying</ i> <i>i shouldn' t allow this doctor ... </ i> to perform a miracle to save my baby ?
we don' t get to demand miracles .
honey , god has his plans .
maybe we just have to accept it .
but i was so happy when i was pregnant with eileen .
you know , i haven' t had enough time .
why can' t god let me get to know her first ?
i mean , i don' t want to go against him .
but why can' t his plan be ... to let this doctor save her life ?
prof. blalock .
mrs. saxon told me you plan to operate on her baby .
have you seen this child , doctor ?
i check on her every day .
and you' re still going to proceed ?
have you had any success in the lab ?
absolutely .
i successfully performed a shunt on a dog just two weeks ago .
i can' t imagine you' re going to proceed based on the laboratory success on a dog .
how many people have you saved ?
so what you' re saying is you' re performing an experiment ... not an operation ?
my instincts tell me nature made a mistake and i can fix it .
would you like to see what i' ve been doing , father ?
right now my instincts tell me perhaps you should come back another day .
what ?
your quest for glory is vain , arrogant .
it takes arrogance to cut someone with a scalpel to save their life .
i have no doubt .
but if you intervene with god' s will ... violate the purity of an innocent heart ... the parents , not you , doctor , will bear the burden of guilt .
perhaps god is , as you say , trying to kill this child .
i am not .
look at this .
the shunt gave out .
looks like a train wreck .
what happened to you , ponchos ?
maybe we should just stop here , doctor .
no .
we using the wrong vessel ?
what the hell' s going on ?
viv , get up .
wake up .
it' s okay .
it' s okay , baby .
it' s just a nightmare .
my god .
where the hell have you been , vivien ?
i had a dream about this white woman last night .
perhaps that' s something best kept to yourself .
no .
i knew it was eileen saxon .
she was all grown up .
she was sitting there in a corner .
she was knitting ... and she let out a baby voice ... and she fell over dead .
i couldn' t see it ... but i knew on the inside she had a baby heart .
she just fell over dead .
what the hell does that have to do with ....
the stitches didn' t grow .
when we did the shunt on ponchos , he was 10 pounds .
he went up to 20 .
he pulled it loose .
i was wrong .
purse stringing doesn' t work .
we need a new stitching technique .
continuous on the back wall , interrupted on the front wall .
that' s what we need .
and then , the shunt will grow .
65 % oxygenation .
she' s deteriorating so rapidly .
have we got time to practice the operation ?
we can' t let up .
what about the new stitching technique ?
we' re trying it out tomorrow .
you have to see this .
vivien thomas is operating , assisted by the chief of surgery .
pull the inbound vein anastomosis .
long , slow , general arc .
i can' t see .
can you see , vivien ?
could you adjust that lamp ?
are the clamps still holding ?
yes .
no kinking ?
none .
all right , now for the tough part .
continuous sutures on the back wall ... interrupted on the front .
removing bulldog clamp .
come on , girl .
come on , please .
that' s it , a little bit more .
i can feel the flow to the lungs .
helen , tell the saxons we' il be operating .
you bet .
you' il be ready .
yes , now that i' ve seen the master at work .
master of the hounds .
your daddy should be proud of you .
i think he is .
mine was only proud of the fact that i could wiggle my ears .
i think he' il be proud when you operate .
he' s dead .
the dead are with us all the time , i believe .
can' t separate the past from the future ... any more than you can your right arm from your left arm .
but , you see , they are separated ... by this , by the heart .
or connected .
or connected .
</ i> do not touch .
do not touch the heart .
we are gonna challenge this ancient doctrinal myth ... in this hospital .
who wants to attend ?
dr. swedlin ?
dr. philmore ?
dr. cooley .
and dr. longmire .
thank you .
you' re dangling your reputation off a cliff .
calm down , walter , this isn' t grand opera .
do no harm " ?
what are you saying ?
postpone the operation until you have more experience .
postponing means signing that baby' s death warrant .
i will not be the one to do that .
but they' il ruin you .
walter , i' m operating tomorrow .
you' re rushing this ... because you don' t want to admit to those parents ... that you spoke too soon .
you should come to bed .
i tried that .
can i give you a ride to the hospital tomorrow ?
thanks .
i could use the lift .
i don' t trust myself behind the wheel .
al , anybody would be nervous .
it' s not that .
i was just thinking about a remark you made .
you said i used to be wild ... not just ambitious .
but i wonder if my ambition hasn' t driven me wild .
dr. taussig , professor .
i just wanted to wish good luck to everyone .
thank you , vivien .
thanks , vivien .
we' re going to block that baby' s pulmonary artery for 30 minutes .
as long as her blood pressure doesn' t go below 60 , i think she should be fine .
i don' t think she can survive much lower than that .
lsn' t that right , dr. harmel ?
not below 60 .
that' s right , doctor .
dr. blalock , they' re ready .
doctor .
coming in now .
dr. longmire .
what is going on ?
they won' t page him .
why not ?
something about hospital policy .
page vivien thomas immediately .
dr. blalock , what' s wrong ?
what' s happened ?
it' s all right .
i won' t tell you again .
page him .
we' re only allowed to page doctors .
give me that , goddamn you .
vivien thomas , paging vivien thomas .
<i>you' re wanted in or right now . </ i>
<i>come on the run , do you hear ? </ i>
this is blalock .
thank you .
good luck .
jesus .
about time .
scrub up .
scrub up ?
you' re coming in with me .
would you find mr. thomas something to stand on ?
what for , doctor ?
you' re talking me through this .
now scrub up .
what' s he doing here ?
what the hell is that ?
i' il see about this .
should we say a prayer ?
forget it .
he won' t listen to me .
dr. blalock , a word .
you can resume your duties .
these are his duties .
can you see now ?
yes , doctor .
okay , i think we' re ready to start .
okay , we' re going in .
it' s going to be all right .
it' il be just fine .
she' il be all right .
lncising the mediastinum pleura ... from the main left pulmonary artery .
to the apex of the pleural space .
i' m dissecting the pulmonary artery .
well back into the mediastinum .
this all right , vivien ?
that looks fine .
the right angle clamp .
okay , i think it' s holding .
are you able to deliver to the left subclavian artery ?
i believe so .
blood pressure ?
70 , falling .
do not move that light .
and now ...
i' m dividing the  careful .
clamp it .
i can' t reach it , doctor .
i got it .
hemorrhage controlled .
can you see , doctor ?
not really .
nurse .
for goodness sake , can' t you even see my ears ?
sorry , doctor .
suture .
blood pressure is 68 .
yes , go on .
watch the carotid .
yes , traction on the suture .
okay , now the clamp vivien made .
what clamp ?
the one just there .
right there , yes .
we' re about to connect the shunt .
blood pressure is 60 .
no , 59 .
i know , i' m almost there .
now front , interrupted .
that' s good , doctor .
just a little more now .
removing the bulldog clamp .
i see some bleeding right  i know , i see it , too .
suture .
no , doctor , the other way .
yes .
good , you got it now .
bleeding controlled .
i' m palpating the connection .
what do you feel ?
i can' t tell if blood is flowing through the shunt .
it' s just too small to feel anything .
dr. blalock , you have to see this .
my god .
her blood pressure is rising .
evacuate the blood in the chest cavity .
put in the chest tube .
are we inflating the left lung with oxygen ?
ready for closure .
who would have thought it possible ?
heart surgery .
and we did it right here in johns hopkins .
thank you , dr. blalock .
thank you so much .
i knew you could do it .
some operation .
amazing .
that child' s chances were so slim .
took a hell of a surgeon to pull her through .
he was lucky to have that nigger in there with him .
thomas sure saved his ass .
i' d like to see him try it without him .
you did well in there , vivien .
thank you .
you performed an excellent surgery , doctor .
yes .
i think i did .
please , i understand .
this is a hospital .
can you please keep your voices down ?
i can understand how you all must feel ... but we have been overwhelmed with children from all across the country ... and then there' s just one doctor to perform these operations .
so if you could just go to the administration office ... they' il accommodate all of you into dr. blalock' s schedule ... as soon as possible .
all right ?
i' m terribly sorry .
making the first incision .
are you there , vivien ?
yes , i' m here .
thank you for the opportunity to observe , dr. blalock .
it' s an honor , doctor .
again , excellent work , gentlemen .
thank you , helen .
may i introduce my colleagues ...
dr. helen taussig , vivien thomas .
this is dr. craford , from stockholm ...
and dr. petrovsky from leningrad .
honored to meet you .
you have given surgeons around the world great courage with your deeds .
coming from such an eminent surgeon as yourself , that is a compliment , indeed .
it' s been a great pleasure to meet you , dr. taussig .
thank you .
dr. thomas .
call me mr. thomas , or vivien .
you' re not a doctor ?
no , i just work here with dr. blalock .
can we please have all the doctors who participated ... in the " blue baby " operation in this shot ?
there' s a young woman who hitchhiked from appalachia with her son .
and i think his blood levels may be low enough to test .
talk to dr. taussig about scheduling him in .
lf you' d all turn and face the center , please , like dr. longmire .
helen .
very good .
thank you , now focus your attention here , please .
smile , focus here .
hold that .
good .
now if we could have one of you alone , dr. blalock .
very good , sir .
focus here , if you would .
here we go , doctor .
thank you very much .
they' re nice pictures , aren' t they ?
they always have nice pictures .
just ' cause you' re not in the news doesn' t mean you weren' t there , viv .
i' il be back .

what the hell is this ?
i need to do something different .
what about our work ?
you got all of those other people you were thanking .
what are you talking about ?
belvedere hotel .
the belvedere is segregated .
you were there ?
snuck in , just like a bellhop .
ls that what this is about , hobnobbing with the powers that be ?
vivien , they will never let you into their club .
it is naive to think otherwise .
will you stand still ?
i' m not talking about them .
i' m not talking about hopkins .
i' m talking about you .
me ?
what have i ever done except fight in your corner ?
i have taken you every step of the way with me ... and now you want to throw all that away ?
for what ?
ls that any way to show your gratitude ?
i don' t know .
you tell me , doctor .
vivien , take pride in the fact you have power in your mind ... and in your heart .
and in my hands .
exactly , in your hands .
we made history together .
we changed the world .
the world .
i' m invisible to the world .
i don' t mind that .
i understand that .
i thought it was different in here .
<i>mr .
thomas , i' m a little confused . </ i>
<i>now you want college credit</ i> <i>for morgan state ... </ i> <i>without actually taking classes ? </ i>
ln certain courses , yes .
i' il take the test .
i' il take finals ...
chemistry , biochemistry , science , physics .
also , i can get the credit for material i already know .
i need to get through college a little more quickly ... so i can get on to med school .
and so you actually participated ... in all this groundbreaking research , mr. thomas ?
yes , i did .
i' m afraid it just doesn' t work like that .
you' il have to start with freshman english .
social science , maybe .
i don' t have time for that .
i' m 35 years old .
you' re saying that i have to start at the beginning ?
yes , mr. thomas .
i' m afraid that is in fact what i' m saying .
i thought this institution provided opportunity for colored people ?
i have a wife , two young daughters , son .
and i' ve been working in my field for over ....
almost 15 years now .
i' m from nashville , i came ....
and what can i do for you ?
my name is vivien thomas .
i work for the ralph wintham company .
we have a line of pharmaceuticals , particularly antacids .
we already have a supplier of antacids .
yes , well , these antacids block against gastroesophageal reflux ...
without any adverse side effect  vivien thomas .
the fellow with the blue babies ?
a patient of mine who works at the hospital told me about you .
hopkins is doing well because of what you did for them ... and here you are .
i don' t have anything against the hospital .
i' m just working in medicine in a different way now .
let' s see what other lines you have .
yes , we have effervescent powder here ....
oh , william , look who' s here ?
hello .
say hi to grandma .
my goodness .
how you doing , sweetheart ?
look at him .
stop running .
go up and wash your hands .
and you bring your little sister down .
and be careful on them steps .
what about construction ?
i keep asking him .
thomas and thomas .
with the building boom , we could clean up .
now , he know i can' t saw a plank worth a damn .
yeah , that' s the truth .
yeah , dad .
i did see that mailbox leaning to the side a little bit .
i don' t understand why you quit teaching in the first place .
i never really liked the classroom that much , clara .
too many kids .
but you fought all those years , and you won the case , so
exactly .
and quitting now means you' ve just wasted a whole lot of time .
no  i don' t think it' s a waste of time .
lf harold wasn' t down there doing what he was doing ... there' d still be a lot of colored teachers down there getting cheated .
i think they ought to name a school after him .
yeah .
harold thomas high .
harold thomas high .
hear , hear .
no , most of these young teachers , they don' t know anything about that strike .
they take their equal paycheck for granted .
harold , you' re full of excuses .
there' s no point in waiting for the world to thank you .
that bus ain' t never going to come .
amen to that .
i' m not waiting , pop .
i' m just looking for something that excites me as much as ... hammering nails pleases you .
viv , <i>jeopardy</ i> is on .
i' il be in in a minute .
you okay ?
i' m fine .
stomach' s bothering me a little bit , but i' m fine .
why don' t you take those fancy antacid pills that you always brag about ?
it' s your brother ?
i miss him .
i miss the old harold .
seems a little lost now .
i miss you .
still got my mind in that lab .
it' s not just your mind , viv .
it' s your heart , too .
i don' t know what i' m supposed to do , clara .
i think i' ve embarrassed myself enough .
i can' t go back in there with my tail between my legs .
it' s where you belong , vivien thomas .
so how you walk back on in there , well , that' s up to you .
yes ?
doctor .
good morning .
how was your trip to europe ?
it was very gratifying ... and how well it seems to have stood on its feet ... for this moment in time .
what can i do for you , vivien ?
i' ve made a mistake ... and i would like my old position back .
and how' s it going to be any different ?
i' m still the same self righteous bastard .
it' s not about you .
it' s about the work .
i like the work .
mr. thomas , we' ve got an animal going into shock here .
what do we do , sir ?
did you try clamping off the lateral part of the atrium ?
yeah , hold it right there .
careful .
okay .
yeah .
you handled yourself well there , doctor .
that' s good .
thank you .
it started
there was a message for you , mr. thomas .
dr. blalock wanted to see you .
i' m sorry .
would you ....
tell him i' il see him  he' s about to leave for the day .
honey , i have to call you back .
okay .
how' s your girls ?
they' re fine .
they' re doing well .
theo' s in morgan state now .
that must feel good .
yes .
how are things with you ?
i' ve had the unfortunate experience of being put in the hands of a surgeon .
you have something on your mind , doctor ?
yes , columbia' s been dangling an offer to teach ... but i wanted to talk to you first .
i really would like you to come with me .
they know about your work .
you could write your own ticket .
it' s hard to imagine being there without you .
i thank you for thinking of me , doctor .
i think i should stay here .
we could do great things there .
wouldn' t it be fun to do it one more time ?
one more time .
i like what i' m doing .
teaching , helping people along .
working with the young doctors .
i like it here at hopkins .
yeah , i guess you got your own things going on here now .
i recognize this man .
man looks very distinguished up there .
thank you , vivien .
that was a while ago .
yeah .
i' m feeling the years now .
yes .
we all are now .
you know , vivien ... they say you haven' t really lived ... unless you have a lot to regret .
i regret ....
i have some regrets .
but i think we should remember not what we lost ... but what we' ve done .
all the lives we saved , and we did .
we saved plenty , didn' t we , vivien ?
yes , we did .
no .
