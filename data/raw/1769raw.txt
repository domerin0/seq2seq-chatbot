stand by , flies .
stand by , flies .
stand by , flies .
and cue .
cue !
cue !
it is the cause , it is the cause , my soul ,
let me not name it to you , you chaste stars !
it is the cause .
yet i' il not shed her blood ;
nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow ,
and smooth as monumental alabaster .
yet she must die ,
else she' il betray more men .
sh !
if i quench thee , thou flaming minister ,
i can again thy former light restore ,
but once put out thy light , thou cunning' st pattern of excelling nature ,
i know not where is that promethean heat
that can thy light relume .
she wakes .
who' s there ?
othello ?
ay , desdemona .
will you come to bed , my lord ?
have you pray' d tonight , desdemona ?
ay , my lord .
if you bethink yourself of any crime unreconcil' d as yet to heaven and grace ,
solicit for it straight .
alas , my lord !
what do you mean by that ?
i would not kill thy unprepared spirit ;
no , heavens forfend !
i would not kill thy soul .
talk you of killing ?
ay , i do .
what' s the matter ?
that handkerchief that i so lov' d and gave thee .
thou gav' st to cassio .
no , by my life and soul !
send for the man and ask him .
down , strumpet !
kill me tomorrow ; let me live tonight !
nay , if you strive ...
but half an hour !
being done , there is no pause .
but while i say one prayer !
it is too late !
oh , my good lord ...
bravo !
bravo !
bravo !
oh , my good lord , yonder' s ...
bravo !
bravo , mr kynaston ! ... foul murders done !
bravo !
well done , mr kynaston !
bravo !
kynaston !
kynaston !
oh , my good lord , yonder' s foul murders done .
it' s the same every bloody show !
it' s not working .
what do you mean ?
i' m trying to get to the end .
they' re shouting , " kynaston !
we haven' t finished the show for three weeks .
fucking ned kynaston !
not again , dickie !
it' s my scene his fans ruin .
my entrance !
my lines !
emilia dies too , you know .
dear boy , i had no idea .
that does it .
i serve my notice , mr betterton .
i quit !
mr kynaston !
mr k !
mr k , you were brilliant !
such eyes , such hair , such lips and voice to thrill .
surely you were the most beautiful woman in the house .
see , pepys likes it .
i' m talking about my death scene .
something eludes me .
a gesture , a tone .
you know what , tommy ?
i' m dying too soon .
there' s an actor for you .
my death scene doesn' t go on long enough .
grasp the fact , mr kynaston .
the performance is a grand success .
what i don' t grasp is this .
the king comes to the show last week ...
this is othello ?
this is othello .
and he says , the king says ,
bravo , betterton .
wonderful show .
lots of thrills and chills .
we' re coming again , saturday next .
one question , though .
could you make it cheerier ?
cheerier ? " says i. " yes , " he said .
just make it a little bit more jolly .
so i say ,
your majesty , shakespeare ends his play with desdemona strangled ,
emilia stabbed , and othello disembowelling himself .
do you suggest we do away with all that ?
oh , no , " he says , " kill ' em all .
just make it jollier .
what none of you glean is that the king is expressing a particularly salient view of the stage .
ah , your grace , what salient view of the stage would that be ?
he wants surprises .
the king' s been away .
the theatre' s been closed for 18 years .
now he' s back , the theatres are open , what does he find ?
the same old things .
poetry , he approves .
ideas , he approves .
two ladies to see mr kynaston .
death , tragedy , yes .
but surprise him .
are they of quality ?
what about sex , vis vis the stage ?
the king approves of love , the idea .
what about sex , the expression ?
poetry can express sex .
so can sex .
mr kynaston , if you insist on something more graphic , show a tit .
the king won' t complain .
how would you suggest i do that ?
surprise me .
excuse me , two gentleladies want to come backstage .
two of them ?
excellent .
they wish to be received by mr kynaston .
five minutes .
then bring them back .
why five minutes ?
got to put my visage back on .
they want the illusion , not some green room hermaphrodite .
this , tommy , is why i deserve a share .
oh , no .
what are you two talking about ?
mr kynaston' s contract is up .
he' s putting the screws on me .
i want a share of the company .
i' m as much a draw as you are .
more so .
prove it !
well , where are your fans ?
where are your ladies ?
oh , all right .
but a share of the company is out of the question .
however as a gesture of faith to prove that i am trying to find a way , in the interim , from this time forth , you can have approval of any actor who shares the stage with you .
gentlemen , you are my witnesses .
noted .
and i' m off to another show .
what show ?
something new .
i' il join you .
good show , betterton .
lovely as always , mr k.
your grace .
gentlemen .
pepys !
mmm !
go away .
ah !
mr betterton !
could i have a word with you a moment , please ?
oh , look , there' s mr betterton !
evening , ladies .
i wasn' t good tonight .
you were splendid .
yes .
but i wasn' t good .
same old things .
fortunately , they keep giving us new audiences .
why does one act ?
when you act , you can be seen .
hmm ?
greet your public .
it always cheers you up .
wait .
wait !
now
lady meresvale and miss frayne .
oh !
you start .
you do it .
oh , you do it .
i' il die !
mr kynaston , we saw the performance this evening .
we' re such fans , i can' t tell you .
she' s seen you six times .
she has .
juliet and ophelia .
and the one with no hands .
mr kynaston , i am a great fan .
and i was wondering ...
well ...
would you be willing to ride with us through st james' s tonight ?
it would be such an honour to have you .
please , please , please !
please !
if you give me half an hour to remove my face and clothes .
oh , no , don' t , please !
mr kynaston , weod ke you to eave you r appearance as is .
he said yes !
this is so good !
mr kynaston , if i may , would you be able to make me an advance on salary ?
advance ?
that' s unlike you .
till the end of the week .
how much ?
six .
thank you .
will you be needing me later ?
oh , yes .
hopeless without .
how long do you think you' il be with them ?
three hours , say ?
yes , i' il be here .
mr kynaston !
mr kynaston !
is he coming ?
do hurry up , mr kynaston , please !
all these people !
mr kynaston !
man are you an actor , too ?
i played the moor .
you look different .
yes , i' m not really black .
where were you ?
thought you' d abandoned us .
i couldn' t get away .
did you bring it ?
she' d better had .
mr cockerell .
if you expect to perform , i expect my guarantee .
it' s my risk , you know .
it' s illegal to have these on stage .
both of us were rather wondering if you were ... really ... ... well , a gentleman .
for , you see , my father' s a wigmaker .
he says you' re much too beautiful to be a gentleman .
he says you must be a woman .
my mother' s friend , the earl of lauderdale , says , if you' re a man , you don' t have a gentleman' s thingy .
he says you' re like those italian singers , the whatsits ?
castrati .
the earl says they cut off your castrati at birth .
then you become a woman .
so the earl of lauderdale is not a surgeon ?
no , he' s an earl .
well ...
how then may we prove to both your father and your mother' s special friend ... ... that i do indeed have a thingy ?
a big , bulging , orb and sceptre of a thingy .
well , i ...
i ...
i think we' d ...
we' d have to ...
we' d have to ...
we' d have to touch it .
touch what ?
what ?
what ...
whatever it is .
oh !
mmm !
if i quench thee , thou flaming minister ,
i can again thy former light restore ,
but once put out thy light , thou cunning' st pattern of excelling nature ,
i know not where is that promethean heat
that can thy light relume .
she wakes .
who' s there ?
othello ?
whoa !
whoa !
oh , my !
i think my wrist' s broken .
oh , erm ...
here .
what' s this ?
a shilling .
for services rendered .
women , beware !
i see three fish eager and awaiting .
come , skewer on my pole !
i know a playful bunch when i see ' em .
oh , painted ladies in the night !
universal sign for whores to let .
how much for the each of you ?
for honour' s sake , sir , assert yourself .
well , dear , how can i ?
i' m but a wilting girl .
oh , come on , how much for a fuck ?
do something !
very well .
that one' s a shilling , that one' s a penny .
i' m five pounds a week .
sir , do you know who i am ?
i am lady aurelia meresvale .
she' s the shilling .
oh , you ... !
driver , get us out of here !
wait a minute !
i' ve got a shilling .
wait ho !
i' m not done haggling yet .
i warn you , sir , i doubt you' il find in me what you' re looking for .
oh , ho , ho !
i' il be the judge of that .
now , come on
open up !
found a guardian at the gate , did you ?
five pounds indeed .
' twas the weight , not the price .
wait a minute .
didn' t say no , did i ?
i' m in the market for a mistress .
a male one might be just the thing .
sir , i am spoken for .
oh , come along !
i shall never wear this glove again .
ha , ha , ha !
mark me , bum boy !
i shall see to you and we shall settle this account .
two , three ... four , five , six !
cheers !
even if it was only a one off , at least we did it once , eh ?
and in under three hours !
oh , no , i have to go !
maria !
maria , where are you going ?
my dear !
mr pepys !
maria , that was quite a performance .
thank you , sir .
hidden talents .
thank you .
yes , well ...
who' d have thought it ?
our secret , eh ?
yes , quite .
i say , do you know , i was wondering , maria ,
i know it is rather last minute , but still , if i may , tomorrow evening ...
really ?
oh , yeah .
if you' re free , that is ?
what happened to my pillow ?
oh , god , a tear .
did i do that ?
ah , must have .
oh , we do not know our passions .
oh , maria , i am exhausted .
why ?
those two gentleladies wanted to feel my cock for the sake of a wager .
ah .
are you in a hurry to get home ?
no .
help me .
i want to do the death scene again .
now ?
mm .
all the elements are there .
it just feels off .
the audience doesn' t notice .
i' m not satisfied .
you be othello .
i' il be me .
where do i start ?
i' il start .
alas ...
alas , he is betray' d , and i ... undone !
grab the pillow .
out , strumpet !
weep' st thou for him to my face ?
o , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
down , strumpet !
kill me tomorrow ; let me live tonight !
now come at me .
nay , if you strive ...
but half an hour !
being done , there is no pause .
but while i say one prayer !
it is too late .
smother , smother , smother .
she doesn' t kiss him .
what is it ?
did they succeed ?
did who succeed ?
the ladies .
in feeling you .
what kind of girl do you take me for ?
help me with this .
do you want me to mend your pillow ?
oh , do it tomorrow .
day off .
plenty of time .
you could use a new one .
maria ... ... this pillow was given to me by my old tutor who found me in the gutter .
he gave me a home .
he gave us all a home , pretty boys like me .
he taught us to read .
he taught us shakespeare , all the tricks and turns and ...
he gave this to me the first time i played desdemona .
and remember , " he' d say ,
the part doesn' t belong to an actor .
an actor belongs to a part .
never forget .
you' re a man in woman' s form .
or was it the other way round ?
well , he' s dead now .
hard to prove either way .
i think you' d be as fine a man as any woman .
maria ...
we are souls entwined .
off you go .
i can shed my skin without you .
oh !
damn !
milady .
don' t ever do that again !
oh , my god !
what are you doing here ?
thought i' d surprise you .
oh !
where' ve you been ?
i was stranded in st james' s park .
a frilly fop with a hard on thought i was a whore on the make .
this is why i prefer hyde park .
there' s so much less of that sort of thing .
so , what happened ?
once he found my cock , off he went .
it wasn' t the case with me .
let me show you something .
here .
read .
i saw the lady drest .
the woman plays today ...
the woman plays ... " the woman ?
what ?
hm ?
an actress .
a what ?
an actress .
at cockerell' s tavern .
the cockpit put up a little stage .
very tatty , but still .
my , my , it' s a joke .
it' s a fake .
jimmy noakes ...
i know jimmy noakes .
and it was not jimmy noakes .
it was not any man .
it was a girl .
but it' s illegal .
one did think as much .
wha ...
a woman playing a woman .
what' s the trick in that ?
what was the play ?
no !
if you' re wondering , she did not play the moor .
how was she ?
what ?
oh , you mean the acting ?
i never noticed the acting .
did you go round after ?
oh , too crowded .
pepys went .
if two mice were fucking in a nutshell , he' d find room to squeeze in and write it down .
what was her name ?
the " actress " ?
er , mrs margaret hughes . ...
margaret hughes .
the word is , she' s going to be at the palace tomorrow night .
the palace ?
oh ...
are you invited ?
i' m the duke of buckingham .
i always am .
are you going ?
i might drop by .
take me there .
you want to go to the palace ?
yes .
with me ?
yes .
you' il go as an acquaintance who behaves himself .
if you try to grow your part , you' il find the role' s been cut .
agreed .
right , then .
oh , ned ...
put this on , will you ?
i like to see a golden flow as i die in you .
would you ask your lady whores to wear a wig to bed ?
if it made them more a woman .
# who can resist such mighty , mighty charms ?
# who can resist
# such mighty , mighty charms ?
# victorious , victorious , victorious love
# who can resist # who can resist
# who can resist # who can resist
# who can resist
# such mighty charms ?
# such mighty , mighty
# mighty , mighty charms
bravo !
bravo !
well done !
ha , ha !
his grace , the duke of buckingham , and mr edward kynaston !
george , you' re late !
your majesty .
i thought you' d skipped us .
and kynaston ?
i know you .
you' re ...
the actor .
oh , yes , you were in ...
othello , sir .
this thursday last at mr betterton' s .
were you ?
not lago , i hope .
i didn' t like him .
i played desdemona .
ah !
that kynaston .
late wife of the murderous moor .
went to see the show last week
the curtain was late .
i said , " what' s the matter ?
they said , " your majesty , desdemona is still shaving .
you paint a blush upon me , sir .
do you know miss gwynn , my pretty , witty nell ?
mr kynaston , i am a great admirer .
oh !
nell is the most ardent theatregoer in london .
i used to be an orange girl .
i worked the stalls before , during and after every performance .
oranges !
oranges !
two pence a pair !
yes , exactly
kynaston , about the othello .
saw it last week .
good show .
but it needed changes .
you see , it could be a bit ...
jollier ?
that' s what i said .
yes , what we want are ...
surprises ?
exactly .
but we don' t want to know they' re coming .
mr samuel pepys !
and mrs margaret hughes !
your majesty .
pepys , you brought a guest .
mrs hughes ,
miss gwynn .
i' d take your hand but my tit' d fall out .
and mr kynaston .
k n gg hon , are you overcome ?
oh , dear .
are you all right , mrs hughes ?
yes ...
sir charles sedley .
sedley , i think you know everyone here .
except for mrs hughes and mr kynaston .
kynaston ...
it feels i' ve had the honour already .
or you' ve already had the honour of feeling it .
obviously , i' m behind in my drinking .
shall we go in for dinner ?
oh , we' re deeply privileged .
lady jane bellamy , follow me .
allow me , mrs hughes .
i can explain everything .
are you a philosopher ?
you , pepys , the duke , this is all some great joke the three of you are playing .
mr kynaston , i had no idea ...
mrs hughes , will you sit next to me ?
don' t make a scene .
george , do you know lady jane bellamy ?
no , but i certainly hope to .
tell me about your parentage , miss gwynn .
my mum was a whore , my father in the navy .
i see .
that' s why i don' t never do sailors .
i' m sorry i missed your performance tonight , miss gwynn .
will you do it again ?
no .
and all that for a one off .
work , work , work , and it' s over in a pop .
like charlie .
what , my dear ?
miss gwynn , i remind you , you are speaking of the father of his people .
well ... a lot of ' em .
mrs hughes , have you seen mr kynaston perform ?
he' s doing desdemona in othello now .
you' ve seen it , george ?
yes .
i never tire of othello .
truth be told , sir , he never tires of desdemona .
kynaston , isn' t there someone else who does desdemona ?
can' t think of his name now .
james noakes .
yes , good actor noakes
not quite his part , though .
doesn' t have your beauty .
no , kynaston , desdemona is yours alone .
ha , ha !
well , but if i may , sir ...
a part doesn' t belong to an actor , an actor belongs to a part .
don' t you agree , sir ?
don' t know .
do you agree , mr kynaston ?
oh , well , there have been other desdemonas before me , sir .
there will be more after .
in fact , the duke of buckingham saw another one just last night .
did you , your grace ?
george , what performance does mr kynaston refer to ?
you showed me the fly bill .
i think i have it .
yes , here it is .
the cockpit tavern .
yes , that was name of the theatre , wasn' t it ?
well , it wasn' t strictly a theatre .
the woman ... plays today
mrs margaret ...
mrs hughes .
is this you ?
yes .
you ?
a woman ?
performed in a play ?
in a public theatre against the order of the crown ?
as his grace said , it' s not a real theatre .
it' s more a sort of tavern , and hence , outside ...
i am the first minister , mrs hughes .
i know what the law ...
mrs hughes .
this performance of yours , was it too a one off ?
well , sir , it certainly was novel .
but we had hoped to have more chances .
that' s the tricky thing about novelty .
do it more than once , it' s not novel any more .
that may be true , mr kynaston .
but in the theatre , i am told , there are no old shows , just new audiences .
ha !
are you going to do it again ?
she most certainly is not .
sir , i insist you issue a proclamation
closing this cockpit ...
but , charlie !
sir ...
silence !
when my father was alive , it had long been illegal for a woman to perform in public .
in the palace , of course , it was women galore .
private musicales , masques ...
no one gave a damn .
except ... the clerics .
one minister , a mr prynne , wrote a pamphlet against all actresses as lewd women ... and whores .
now my mother acted in some of those court masques .
and she felt mr prynne' s diatribe was directed at her .
so , mr prynne was tried , convicted , and sentenced to the stocks .
where his feet were burned , his ears lopped off , and his tongue cut out .
yet ... in spite of all this ,
mr prynne never recanted .
some say his stoicism in the face of such excess ... ... is what fanned the flames of the puritan revolt .
and so , off with my father' s head .
and i to holland for 20 years .
i think it might be fun to see women on the stage .
they have had them in france for a long time now .
yes .
whenever we' re about to do something truly horrible , we always say the french have been doing it for years .
hyde , issue a proclamation .
permission to perform is hereby granted .
for mrs hughes ?
to all women .
we wish to see this new othello at the earliest possible convenience .
say , saturday .
make note , hyde .
saturday , othello .
the other one .
so , kynaston , will you see mrs hughes perform ?
i' d love to know what you think of the death scene .
oh , i' m always interested in how my rivals die .
your grace ?
well , no .
i' ve had my fill of desdemonas .
shall i escort you home , mrs hughes ?
yes .
i' il see mrs hughes home .
i suddenly find myself a devotee of the stage .
not in an artistic sense , of course .
but as a sort of patron
i' m off as well .
kynaston ... shall i drop you ?
yes , i need my sleep .
we' re auditioning new emilias tomorrow , then two shows of you know what .
mrs hughes , perhaps i' il see you there ?
sir charles .
i shall never wear this glove again .
mrs hughes .
the cockpit tavern is no place for someone of your particular attractions .
i think you should audition for mr betterton' s theatre tomorrow .
i couldn' t .
what about mr kynaston ?
surprise him .
morning , mr kynaston .
your picture' s selling well .
anyone want to buy a rabbit ?
mr kynaston .
mr betterton .
i wish to discuss with you the role of emilia .
bit over the top for that , aren' t we , sunshine ?
not me , sir .
not me .
i come to speak on behalf of mrs margaret hughes .
mr kynaston .
aha !
mrs hughes .
settling in , i see .
that dress one of mine ?
i made it for myself .
oh , of course you did .
you' re so good at the needle and pin .
mr kynaston , i must apologise ...
oh , no , no .
please .
just a question , as you are quite obviously going to audition today .
do you know the five positions of feminine subjugation ?
what ?
the five positions of feminine subjugation .
no ?
or perhaps you' re more acquainted with the pose of tragic acceptance ?
or the demeanour of awe and terror ?
mr kynaston ...
the supplicant' s clasp ?
or the attitude of prostrate ...
funny , you' ve seen me perform them a thousand times .
mr kynaston !
now , there' s a feminine gesture .
you seem to have managed the stamp of girlish petulance .
i just wanted to act .
i just wanted to do what you do .
but , madam ,
i have worked half my life to do what i do .
14 boys crammed in a cellar .
when i trained , i was not permitted to wear a woman' s dress for three years .
i was not permitted to wear a wig for four , not until i had proved that i had eliminated every masculine gesture , every masculine intonation , from my very being .
what teacher did you have ?
what cellar was your home ?
i had no teacher , nor such a classroom .
but then , i had less need of training .
at any rate , mr kynaston , i thank you for the professional advice .
but i did not come here today to audition .
oh , come , i saw sedley downstairs singing your praises ...
what he does is his business .
sir charles has taken an interest in me .
oh , sir charles !
sir charles ?
other actors have aristocratic patrons .
whom would you rather take me in hand ?
i did not come here to audition .
i only came to the theatre today
to collect my belongings ...
well ...
but now , sir !
oh , now ...
oh , lest i forget .
your advance , sir .
you' il be pleased to know it was your generosity that bought last night' s performance .
put paid .
with interest .
you want to pay me to watch an audition ?
this could start a trend .
who is your protg ?
mr betterton , this is mrs margaret hughes .
maria ?
maria ?
it' s an off stage name .
oh , wait a minute .
so the hughes that played at cockerell' s place last night was ... was ... our maria ?
all of london is talking about mrs hughes ' performance .
and , as you know , the king has , just this past evening , relaxed the laws
against women playing women .
yes , i heard .
and , as this is your day , mr betterton ,
to seek out new emilias ...
yes , yes , i see .
ned , just in time !
such drama .
our very own maria is going to take the stage .
do you have a scene for us , maria ...
er , mrs ...
i do , actually .
well , er ...
what will you be doing for us today ?
a soliloquy .
from ?
othello .
and the role ?
desdemona .
well ...
this should be fun .
sir charles .
thank you , mrs hughes .
what shall i do to win my lord again ?
good friends , go to him ; for , by this light of heaven ,
i know not how ...
may i start again ?
oh , please .
thank you .
what shall i do to win my lord again ?
good friends , go to him ; for , by this light of heaven ...
i know not how ...
i know not how ...
i know not how ...
i know not how ...
i know not how i lost him .
yes , of course .
thank you .
not at all .
i say it every night .
may i begin again ?
oh , heavens .
i was going to suggest it myself .
i know not how ...
i know not how i lost him .
what shall i do to win my lord again ?
good friends , go to him ; for , by this light of heaven ,
i know not how i lost him .
if e' er my will did trespass ' gainst his love ,
either in discourse of thought or actual deed ;
or that mine eyes , mine ears , or any sense ,
delighted them in any other form ;
or that i do not yet , and ever did ,
and ever will ,
though he do shake me off
to beggarly divorcement ,
love him dearly ,
comfort forswear me !
unkindness may do much ;
and his unkindness may defeat my life ,
but never taint ... my love
that was it .
was it ?
oh , yes !
yes , yes , of course it was .
i was caught up with the ... by the gestures and such .
well , well , i , i ...
i' ve er ...
i' ve never seen the role performed quite ... quite like that before .
do you think there might be something for me ?
er , i don' t know .
it ... depends .
on ?
on thousands of actors ahead of you dying of the plague .
intolerable !
ned' s being funny .
it depends on the audiences of london losing their eyes , their ears ...
and truth be told , their sense of smell .
i confess , mrs hughes , when i heard about your performance , i was worried .
women on stage .
what would become of me ?
and then , you auditioned for us .
you have taken a great load off my mind .
mr betterton , thank you for your time .
maria , my dear ...
no , sir , i' m late for mr cockerell' s .
dear , dear .
well , good luck with the show .
i' d love to pop in and see it ...
yes , i' d arrange tickets , but we' re sold out .
sold out ?
maria , maria .
er , mrs hughes .
come , come , come .
ned , ned .
what say we give mrs hughes one of the roles to play ?
no , no , not you know whno , that' s you , of course
but we are looking for an emilia .
she might just ... splash things up a bit .
what do you say ?
i i i refuse .
what do you mean , you refuse ?
i shall not act with her .
on what right ?
my right , mr betterton .
you gave me approval over casting and i hereby exercise said right .
but she' s sold out cockerell' s .
indeed !
the place was packed and the crowd clapped and clapped .
i recall a puppet show once where a recently departed dog was stuffed and danced with punch and judy and that crowd clapped , too .
oh , ned ...
if you argue the case for mrs hughes further , indeed ...
if you attempt to audition her or any other woman ever again ,
i will consider it a breach of contract and leave the stage forthwith !
bitch !
i had myself intended to audition today .
but if this is how you treat women , well , mark me , sir , women shall lay blame .
who the hell was that ?
that ... ... is the king' s mistress .
this shall be remembered , betterton .
oh , my god .
er , sir charles .
sir charles ...
mr kynaston .
i am a man of my contract and my word .
you exercise your right today .
i , mine , tomorrow !
this vile thespian is in need of a come down and on his own turf !
nell , is that you ?
yes .
what is it , sweet ?
charlie ?
mm ?
you love me , don' t you ?
well , i' ve always said .
and you' d never deny me ?
now , what do you want ?
no , i can' t .
please !
it' s out of the question .
i' il never ask another favour .
no !
charlie ...
nell , i' ve work to do .
please ...
charlie boy .
where' s his toy ?
no , this is very important business .
we are at war with the ...
dutch .
oh , your majesty !
let me see the crown !
hyde , erm ...
i want to dictate something .
are you all right , sir ?
now , st james' s park , the gazebo .
your majesty .
your majesty .
your majesty .
your majesty .
we' re going to really hurt him because ...
but we can' t do too much .
we can' t do ...
kynaston !
kynaston !
bravo , mr kynaston !
bravo !
kynaston !
kynaston !
not like that .
mr ned , sir ?
we need to see you
mr kynaston .
mr kynaston , we wish to apologise for our rudeness the other day .
we wish to make things up with you .
may we take you for a drive ?
may we ?
why have we stopped ?
come with us , mr kynaston .
what are you up to ?
it' s more a question of what you' re up to .
have you ever had occasion to perform out of doors ?
er , not that i can recall .
then i beg you , sir , flatter us , who do not deserve your good graces .
hmm .
you mocked us , sir !
you , an actor , mocked your betters .
you shall know the other end of it now , bum boy !
here is the whore of the moor of venice .
where' s your frock , my girl ?
you mistake me , gentlemen !
no mistake !
' tis he .
the slut himself .
just as we have been foretold !
hit him again !
i have in hand an edict .
i wish it passed , put down in law , and circulated throughout the affected areas posthaste .
whereas the women' s parts in plays have hitherto been acted by men in the habits of women , at which some have taken offence , we do permit and give leave , for the time to come , that all women' s parts be acted by women .
no he shall e' er again ... ... upon an english stage play she
mrs hughes , though it be true that talent is as talent does , whilst beauty fades like starlight at the break of day , surely you recognise the fact that you are , without doubt , the most beautiful woman on the english stage .
i am an actress , not a beauty .
be that as it may , if i am to paint your beauty , mrs hughes , i must paint it with tit exposed .
how else prove to the theatregoers of london that you are a real woman ?
want to be taken as a serious actress
my dear , before you can be taken seriously , you must put bums on seats .
all right , paint !
and thus is flesh made art .
kynaston
i see your wounds are on the mend .
yes , i was fallen upon by a gang of critics .
when will you be back on stage , mr k ?
soon , i hope .
as soon as they' il let me .
physicians , eh ?
what role will mark your return ?
what else but desdemona ?
what do you want here , kynaston ?
i want my pillow .
it seems to be lost .
i was wondering if mrs hughes might know where it is .
this is intolerable !
sir charles , gentlemen , could you leave mr kynaston and me for a moment ?
certainly .
you know , mr k , the performance of yours i always liked best ?
as much as i adored your desdemona and your juliet ,
i always loved best the " britches " parts .
rosalind , for instance .
and not just because of the woman stuff , but also because of the man sections .
your performance of the man stuff seemed so right , so ... true .
i suppose i felt it was the most real in the play .
you know why the man stuff seemed so real ?
because i' m pretending .
you see a man through the mirror of a woman through the mirror of a man .
you take one reflecting glass away , it doesn' t work .
the man only works because you see him in contrast to the woman he is .
if you saw him without the her he lives inside , he wouldn' t seem a man at all .
yes , you' ve obviously thought longer on this question than i.
i heard about your ...
yes , yes , i imagined you heard .
i imagined you might have more than heard .
perhaps you even heard before it happened .
i do not have your pillow .
well , you could have said that in front of them .
i have taken nothing that belonged to you !
you wear my clothes , play my parts , live my life and you' ve taken nothing ?
woman' s perspective .
but at least a recognisable one .
that pillow was my own .
it was given to me some time back , as you know .
yes , a dresser always knows a gentleman' s secrets .
of course , i have my own dresser now .
he' s a man .
he used to be an actor .
i don' t suppose you' d guess wnat type ?
you know , madam , i am amazed you have need of an audience !
with such self regard as you display , what room is left for the public' s love ?
what do you know of love , sir ?
or loyalty ?
or adoration suffered in deepest silence ?
the only love you know , sir , is what you act on stage .
the difference between man and man ...
wilt thou be gone ...
it was the nightingale and not the lark ,
that pierc' d the fearful hollow of thine ear ...
oh , look , it' s kynaston !
o , you are men of stone .
o , you are men of stone .
lear .
how did you guess ?
cordelia .
you' re practising the carry .
light ?
lighter than you .
that work in performance ?
in performance , i carry a real woman .
a former seamstress from sheffield twice my size .
so , what do you want ?
er , i want another go at the death scene .
can' t .
the crown would close me down if i did .
tommy ...
you cost me the palace' s support .
you refused to act with women on the day the king' s mistress , a mistress desirous of a career on stage , was watching .
besides , the company' s full up .
you weren' t the only actor cut loose by the law .
the town' s full of your sort now .
mr betterton .
time to see the gonerils .
happy days
tommy , is she ... ?
is she good ?
the hughes ?
as an actress ?
she' s a star .
she did what she did first .
you did what you did last .
good god .
you' il poach in that .
would your grace like me to disrobe ?
quiet .
this isn' t the place .
i thought you hated heat and steam .
i' m purifying myself .
why didn' t you come to my rooms when you heard i' d been attacked ?
i knew you wouldn' t want me to see what they' d done to you .
why didn' t you write ?
ned , i' ve never been a word type
letters are dangerous .
they live on long after their passions have died .
they' re dangerous only if they' re secret .
i' d call us a secret , wouldn' t you ?
there were beginning to be whispers .
those things you said at the palace .
i warned you , ned .
what shall i do to win my lord again ?
don' t .
i' m getting married .
jane bellamy .
you met her , i believe ?
it' s this saturday .
the king' s coming .
dryden' s composed a sonnet .
jane' s quite a charming thing , really .
pretty , rich .
surprisingly literate .
and a woman .
what' s she like in bed ?
what' s she like ... to kiss ?
does she wear a golden flow as you die in her ?
or don' t you know ?
i don' t want you !
not as you are now
i ...
when i did spend time with you ,
i ... always thought of you as a woman .
when we were in bed , it was always in a bed on stage .
i' d think , " here i am , in a play ... ... inside desdemona .
cleopatra , poor ophelia ...
you' re none of them now .
i don' t know who you are .
i doubt you do .
kind sir , would point thy dagger at this comely thicket , my lady ...
kind sir , would point thy dagger at this comely thicket , my lady ...
madam , beg your pardon , i' m looking for miss nell gwynn .
you won' t find her here .
she' s in the wings about to make her entrance .
kind sir , would point thy dagger ...
sir ?
do forgive .
we' re about to perform one of our palace musicales .
sir , the guests ?
you look familiar .
sir , i am edward kynaston .
kynaston !
how in hell did you get in here ?
a former fellow actor is your undercook and has long been dear a friend to me .
then we' il have to execute him .
joke , joke .
calm down , kynaston .
what do you want with nell , anyway ?
nell doesn' t like you very much .
when she came to mr betterton' s theatre , my bile was aimed at another .
i did not even see miss gwynn .
i' m sure you can straighten it out .
but it' s just not important to me .
it is to me !
charlie , what' s holding things up ?
say what you want .
i want to act .
then act .
i want to act as i did before .
the girls ' parts ?
if you will .
i won' t .
balance the scales , kynaston , give the girls a chance .
besides ... it' s a sop to the church .
priests always preach about boys playing women .
they say it leads to effeminacy and sodomy .
well , they' d know , they' re priests .
act a man , kynaston .
how hard could it be ?
it is not a question of acting a man .
i can act a man .
there' s no artistry in that .
there are things that i can be as a woman that i cannot be as a man .
such as ?
a star .
no , i think mr kynaston could be a star in any guise .
if indeed there is no artistry in acting a man , then show us .
be a man for us and perhaps his majesty will change his mind as to whether you can play a woman .
yes , perform a soliloquy that displays all that is bold and strong and masculine in a man .
let' s see you as ... ... othello .
it is the cause ...
it is the cause , my soul ,
let me not name it to you , you chaste st ...
may i start again ?
oh , yes , yes , by all means .
thank you .
it is the cause .
it is the cause , my soul ,
let me not name it to you you chaste stars !
it is the cause .
yet i' il not shed her blood ;
nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow ...
sorry , may i ... once more ?
please .
yet she must die , else she' il betray more men .
put out the light , then put out the light !
oh !
oh !
oh ...
oh !
oh ...
oh ...
oh ...
if ... ... i could ... could give it ... one more go .
i ...
well , well , show to do .
come on .
kynaston !
my astronomers tell me the star' s light shines on long after it has died .
even though it doesn' t know it .
exile is a dreadful thing for one who knows his rightful place .
shall we , sir ?
we shall , madam .
i' m not staying .
it' s by royal command .
stay without me !
mr kynaston !
mr kynaston !
mr kynaston !
there' s an handsome lad !
bet you like a lady , don' t you ?
the difficulty as i see it is that ...
well , a theatregoer these days has so many choices .
there' s mrs corbett doing romeo and juliet ,
mrs bracegirdle in twelfth night ,
mrs barry in hamlet .
and you ... you , of course , in lear .
the house was half full today at best .
well ...
summer , you know .
will you be here for the second performance ?
i fear not , mrs hughes .
going off to see one of my rivals ?
you have no rivals , mrs hughes .
mr pepys .
who do you write all those little notes for ?
for myself alone .
do you enjoy it ?
i love it .
don' t you love acting ?
yes .
but unfortunately , i cannot do it for myself alone .
for i fear ... ... in truth , i' m terrible at it .
oh , now !
now , my dear mrs hughes !
you are too harsh on yourself .
you made your debut as the first actress on the english stage .
mr pepys ... ... when i made my debut , was i a good actress ?
mrs hughes ... ... there was no comparison .
mr cockerell .
mrs hughes .
thought i' d pop in and see the show .
light house today .
oh , mrs hughes ?
do you know mrs barry ?
i have heard so much about you , mrs hughes .
i would so like some day to see your ophelia .
well , let' s have a cordial after the show , eh ?
i want to talk about some changes .
mr pepys yes ?
do you know the whereabouts of mr kynaston ?
# oh , mother , oh , mother
# oh , what shall i do ?
ooooh ...
# i' ve married a man
# who' s unable to screw
# my troubles are many
# my pleasures are small
# for i' ve married a man
# who has no balls at all
# no balls
# no balls at all
# married a man who has no balls at ...
# no balls at ...
# no balls at all !
that was top hole !
and speaking of hole ...
... it is my understanding ,
having circled the room as t' were ...
wahay ! ... that there are some of you gents ...
who , us ? ... and maybe even some ladies out there ...
you can rub my pole any time ! ... what think our little pretty one here is not actually what we call " a complete female stage beauty " or even a real , live ... fish !
well ... we got the proof .
show us the proof !
right here !
ha , ha , ha !
come on !
up further !
missy , dear ... raise the curtain , will you , please ?
up , up , up ...
higher !
stop it !
stop it !
what do you want , trout ?
i want the lady !
after we' ve finished .
i' il give you five pounds !
take the money !
now get the fuck off my stage !
she' s still got your merkin !
and give me back my merkin !
you' ve slept .
you can stay here the week .
i paid the inkeeper that far .
have you eaten ?
no .
we' il get food and drink in you .
and no spirits .
why are you doing this ?
why won' t you play men ?
men aren' t beautiful .
what they do isn' t beautiful , either .
women do everything beautifully , especially when they die .
men feel far too much .
feeling ruins the effect .
feeling makes it ugly .
perhaps that' s why i could never pull off the death scene .
i ... ... could never feel it ... in a way that ... ... wouldn' t mar the ...
i couldn' t let the beauty die .
without beauty , there' s nothing .
who could love that ?
i' il stay with you while you sleep .
want to make sure i don' t run off ?
no .
i' ve never slept with a man before .
and i' ve never slept with a woman ... except myself .
never ?
never slept .
what do men do ?
with women ?
with men .
they ...
we ...
well , it depends .
on ?
on who' s the man and who' s the woman .
but i said men with men .
yes , yes , i know , but with , er ... ... men and women , there' s a man and there' s a woman , and my experience has been that it' s the same with men and men .
were you the man or the woman ?
i was the woman .
that means ?
er , it ...
... um , in the saddle .
so , am i the man now or the woman ?
you' re the man .
and you' re the woman ?
yes .
there isn' t much to do .
not with what we' re given .
so , who am i now ?
er , you' re the man ...
er , you' re the woman !
and you' re ... ?
i' m the man .
or so i assume .
seldom get up here .
quite a view .
but i' m ...
i' m the man woman ?
yes ... you' re the man woman .
and what am i now ?
i ...
you' re the woman .
still ?
yes .
and now what am i ?
the woman .
and now ?
the woman .
and you are ?
the man .
tell me something .
anything !
how do you die ?
what ?
as desdemona .
how do you die ?
oh , no , i' m sorry ...
i wanted ...
your old tutor did you a great disservice , mr kynaston .
he taught you how to speak and swoon and toss your head , but he never taught you to suffer like a woman or love like a woman .
he trapped a man in woman' s form and left you there to die !
i always hated you as desdemona .
you never fought !
you just died beautifully !
no ... no woman would die like that , no matter how much she loved him !
a woman would fight !
i need a desdemona !
what ?
sheffield' s gift to the theatre " has returned to her mother' s to have a baby !
a baby ?
well , that didn' t happen in the old days , did it ?
it' s a catastrophe !
the palace is reconsidering its patronage , the king is coming to see the show tonight and i need a desdemona by eight o' clock .
right , who' s available ?
there is only one actress in london i' m aware of who knows the part , and is currently between bookings .
i won' t do it !
but didn' t you hear him ?
it' s for the king !
but i' m no good .
well , that never stopped you before .
my dear , the king comes tonight to decide whether to patronise my theatre again .
if we put him off , he' il know something' s up !
you must play , mrs hughes !
what do you intend to do about this ?
i can' t play desdemona .
i never could .
i don' t know how to act .
where is he ?
if you could just take her in hand .
teach her some tricks and turns .
most of the play she' il get by , it' s the end that' s bad .
when she dies .
she ... she' s no good !
i say this as a friend .
mr kynaston , have you ever seen mrs hughes on the stage ?
i saw her audition , that was enough .
why ?
what' s she like ?
you .
she does you .
every inflection , every bat of the eye , bits of business , vocal tricks ...
then she shouldn' t be half bad .
but it doesn' t work !
forgive me .
i have spoken loudly .
did she send you here ?
no one knows we' ve come
what do you offer me ... ... pretty , witty nell ?
a friend .
friends i' ve had .
give me an audience .
if that' s what you want , you must take it with your own hands .
a man isn' t how he walks or how he speaks .
it' s what he does .
well ?
what' s your answer ?
gentlemen !
we have procured a tutor !
oh !
ned .
tommy .
kynaston !
some rules of engagement ...
first rule , you' re out .
betterton !
no , no , no , no .
best work in private , sir charles .
we shall exeunt , kynaston , but mark our history and my property .
you are assisting my desdemona .
don' t try anything funny .
if you give her a funny voice or a funny walk , a squint ,
i' il notice .
and i won' t like it .
a critic is born .
and all because i thought you were a whore and grabbed your cock !
now , is there anything you want ?
some wine , some cheese ?
a share .
oh , ho , ho !
now , i would say , " what ?
and you will say ?
" a share .
how much ?
five .
thief .
shall i fetch her , mr kynaston ?
would you be a dear ?
mr kynaston .
mrs hughes .
let' s get to work , shall we ?
er , yes .
are you wearing that tonight ?
yes no , youre not
sir charles designed this costume .
it looks it .
you' il strip down to your shift .
strip ?
you can' t teach me how to be a woman !
i' m not teaching you how to be a woman , but how to be desdemona .
i don' t want to be desdemona .
i don' t want to act ever again .
no !
you claimed the role .
hold onto it till they pry your fingers from its neck .
and you hold this theatre in your hands .
so stand still , dry your eyes and strip !
muss your hair before the scene .
not like that , that' s puffing it to make it look attractive .
no , no , no , no lip paint .
white cheeks .
pale lips .
blood drains down with sleep , not up to the face .
now , the way betterton does the last scene , there are 32 lines , cutting 17 .
you' re the woman , i' m the man .
start on the bed .
not like that !
that' s like me .
is that how you sleep ?
how am i supposed to know how i sleep ?
i' m sleeping while i sleep !
don' t act with what isn' t there !
the man' s been a festering boil
for three fucking hours , hasn' t he ?
yes .
he' s come to your room , woke you and told you to pray before you die .
so , what' s the line ?
talk you of killing ?
ay , i do .
then heaven have mercy on me !
good girl .
keep going .
they are loves i bear to you .
peace , and be still !
and i mean that .
but othello is advancing on her .
am i ?
you see me moving ?
you take two steps back on the first line , then stumble on the last line .
i can' t remember the stumble .
peace , and be still !
by my life and soul , send for the man and ask him .
send for the man and ask him .
easy to say , isn' t it ?
send for the man and ask him .
cassio' s name gives her the willies .
but she doesn' t say the name " cassio " .
aha !
i' m lost .
if lago wanted to poison the moor' s mind with a lover for desdemona , he had to pick someone who made sense .
it couldn' t be ...
jo jo the mute boy .
lago picked cassio because , in truth , desdemona does fancy him .
so , when othello mentions him , she must say , " yes , call for cassio .
but his name doesn' t come easily .
but she doesn' t say his name !
yes .
this next exchange of lines comes fast .
why ?
we want to get to the murder faster than they expect .
how can i say things like , " while i say one prayer , " fast ?
no , you' re not in charge of this part of the scene , the moor is .
the moor says his lines fast .
you have to slap your words in as fast as you can .
go .
alas , he is betray' d , and i undone !
out , strumpet !
weep' st thou for him to my face ?
o , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
down , strumpet !
kill me tomorrow !
nay , if you strive ...
but half an hour !
being done , there is no pause .
but while i say one prayer !
it is too late .
see what comes out of rehearsal ?
i had planned to scream anyway .
good for you .
throw me on the bed , kill me .
no .
we have to finish this off .
save something for the moment .
always do something different than you planned .
good to throw yourself a bit .
recall what we' ve done to this point .
then when you die ... ... surprise me .
but how do i know mr betterton will do as you have done ?
you don' t .
because he won' t .
right , ready to go ?
yes .
i' m playing the moor .
i beg your pardon ?
mrs hughes insists .
mrs hughes ?
i do .
but does he even know the part ?
yes , he knows it .
right , now i' il need bootblack .
i have bootblack .
with you ?
a scuff , sir , is a dreadful thing .
now , out , all of you .
mr kynaston .
my thanks .
it' s not a good part , desdemona .
go for cleopatra .
cleopatra ?
she kills herself with the sting of an asp .
those who do die , do never recover .
i blame you for my death .
what' s that from ?
see you on stage .
it is the cause .
it is the cause , my soul ,
let me not name it to you , you chaste stars !
it is the cause .
who' s there ?
othello ?
ay , desdemona .
will you come to bed , my lord ?
have you pray' d tonight , desdemona ?
ay , my lord .
if you bethink yourself of any crime
unreconcil' d as yet to heaven and grace , solicit for it straight .
alas , my lord , what may you mean by that ?
i would not kill thy unprepared spirit ;
no , heaven forfend !
i would not kill thy soul .
talk you of killing ?
ay , i do .
then heaven have mercy on me !
think on thy sins .
they are loves i bear to you .
ay , and for that thou diest .
that death' s unnatural that kills for loving .
alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ?
these are portents ; but yet i hope ,
i ...
i hope they do not point on ...
peace , and be still !
i will ...
i will so .
what' s the matter ?
that handkerchief ... ... which i so lov' d and gave thee .
thou gav' st to cassio .
no , by my life and soul !
send for ca ... the man and ask him .
his mouth is stopp' d ;
honest lago hath ta' en order for' t .
alas , he is betray' d , and i undone !
out , strumpet !
weep' st thou for him to my face ?
o , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
down , strumpet !
kill me tomorrow ;
let me live tonight !
nay , if you strive ...
but half an hour !
being done , there is no pause .
but while i say one prayer !
it is too ... late .
no !
put out the light !
help !
help !
he' s killing ...
he' s killing me !
what noise is this ?
not dead ?
not quite yet dead ?
i that am cruel am yet merciful ;
so ...
so .
o , my good lord , yonder' s foul murder ...
oh !
falsely ... ... falsely murder' d !
alas !
alas !
alas ... ... what cry is that ?
sweet mistress , speak !
who hath done this deed ?
nobody ,
i myself .
o , farewell !
why , how should she be murder' d ?
bugger !
brava !
brava !
brava !
brava , mrs hughes !
brava !
who knows ?
bravo !
bravo , mrs hughes !
brava , mrs hughes !

mrs hughes !
brava , mrs hughes !

mrs hughes !

hughes !
brava !
very , very good .
brava !
brava !
please , we still have one more scene .
mrs hughes !
mr betterton !
surely that was the finest night i' ve ever had in the theatre .
what performances !
mrs hughes !
producer coming through , thank you .
i do think i did the most extraordinary performance of my life .
isn' t it truly wonderful ?
marvellous , thank you .
good show , betterton !
ho , ho !
thank you .
thrills and chills .
that new ending very , very real .
almost too much so .
but restorative somehow .
well , that' s tragedy for you .
awe and terror , and yet we still go to dinner .
where are mrs hughes and mr kynaston ?
you almost killed me !
i did kill you .
