hey , guys .
i got a surprise for you .

ginuwine .
so which one of you wants to audition for his video ?
what video ?
open calls are in two weeks , and i' il rehearse with anybody who' s up to it .
so which one of you wants to audition for ginuwine' s video ?
all right .
can i help you ?
you' re the dance teacher , right ?
i' m otis' s brother .
you' re the one his little man' s been hanging out with , right ?
you mean benny ?
yeah , benny .
we ain' t seen benny around in a while and we miss him .
he' s been busy .
check this out .
he' s part of my crew .
and when you' re in my crew , you don' t mess with other shit .
so you tell him i' m looking for him .
i' m not gonna do that .
what ?
why not ?
i asked you a question !
yo , honey .
hey .
b. b. , what' s poppin ' ?
am i interrupting ?
well , if it ain' t floyd the barber .
how are things in that cute little barbershop of yours , b. ?
you making ends meet ?
oh , you know .
i' m definitely doing me .
getting this paper .
getting this paper .
check this out .
when you' re tired of nickel and diming, just give me a holler .
i' m gonna hook you up .
well , you ever get tired of wearin ' those bum ass do rags , you give me a holler .
i' il hook you up .
i wanna see that kid .
you okay ?
yeah , i' m cool .
what was that all about ?
how did you get on b. b. ' s bad side ?
i made the wrong friend , i guess .
well , you know , you should stay away from him .
he' s dangerous .
seriously .
yeah .
thinking of picking up some pepper spray tomorrow or something .
did i say thank you ?
you sure you don' t want me to walk you upstairs and make sure you' re safe ?
no .
i can handle myself .
thanks again .
uh
bye .
come on .
mom , what happened ?
another pipe burst .
you can' t be in here .
how long will it take to fix ?
oh , who knows ?
building codes , inspections .
now the city wants to do a full assessment , see if the building' s even worth reopening .
ma , you can' t let them shut you down .
honey , your telling me what i can and cannot do is not gonna improve my mood right now .
i don' t know what to do about this .
lf there' s a danger to the kids
he' s one of those kids , you know , trying to act all bad .
but 10 seconds into a routine , i catch a glimpse of him .
it' s like i can just see this light shining out of him .
he' s a kid again .
yeah .
it' s the best feeling i know seeing that .
it' s scary though .
' cause when i think of him hanging out with b. b. , it' s like i can watch that light get dimmer and dimmer .
well , you know , when a thug joint' s the hottest spot in the hood , it' s hard for a kid not to want to be down .
i know .
i' m over here .
nah , nah , nah .
i wanna show you something .
all right .
all right , sexy ?
stop with that .
you know , most of the kids i came up with werejust like that .
trying to be thugged out , and wanting to fit in .
' cause that' s what everybody else was doing .
where are they now, jail ?
most of them , or headed that way like b. b. , or dead .
listen , this is bad date talk .
we should change the subject .
what' s your favorite color ?
how come you turned out so good ?
she thinks i turned out good .
i' m serious .
i don' t know .
i got lucky .
what happened ?
well , the guy that used to own this shop lived right next door to me and my mom .
and when he saw me get into some bad things , he gave me a job here sweeping up the floors .
it' s crazy ' cause he couldn' t even afford it .
he paid me right out of his own pocket .
i worked for him for 1 0 years .
and when he passed , he left this place to me .
see , b. b. likes to talk shit like i' m the one that' s losing ,
like i' m missing something out there on the streets , but he and i both know who' s winning .
i' ve found something that i truly love , that truly makes me happy .
and that' s a million times better than finding something that makes you rich .
so , it' s just someone believing in you .
well , that and having a place to go where i could stay out of trouble , yeah .
what ?
nothing . just thinking .
about what ?
about what makes me happy .
well , you know , i would really love to be a part of that .
what ?
making you happy .
477 castle hill avenue ... will go for about $170, 000 .
so 17 down ?
seventeen thousand down , yes . ln cash .
how about i give you half the down payment now , and you give me 30 days to come up with the rest ?
lf i don' t , you put it back on the market .
why do you even want this property ?
it' s just an empty storefront on a bad block .
it' s perfect for a dance studio .
maybe even a dance school for the whole neighborhood .
so am i writing a check or not ?
by all means .
five , six , seven , eight .
cut .
you have no idea what this means to them .
oh , sure , i do .
i had a first job too once .

i thought we were going to a meeting .
business and pleasure are the same thing .
you know that , honey .
lf i knew it was a party , i wouldn' t have canceled on my best friend' s birthday .
you would rather go to atlantic city , which will always be there , with friends you always see , instead of going to the hottest party in town with me ?
look .
everybody is gonna be there .

artists , producers , other choreographers .
it would be career suicide if you didn' t go .

nah , it' s not it' s not working .
which part ?
the whole part .
the whole kid thing .
it' s horrible .
no , michael .
don' t do this .
i was thinking i wanted to make it a little more sexy , you know .
a little more real .
what' s more real than these kids ?
oh , no .
michael , don' t do this .
lf you want to get back at me , do that , but don' t take it out on these kids .
katrina , baby .
hey .
all right , now i' m gonna give you some music .
okay .
and i want you to listen and then move .
got you .
go do your thing .
do not take away the one thing they have to be excited about .
look .
i have a lot to do today , all right ?
so if you want to get paid , pack up your shit and take your little friends out of here .
i want you to fire ' em .
i want you to tell them why you' re not using ' em .
what' s going on ?
don' t worry about it .
what makes you think i care what you want ?
yeah , the label called .
they' re not into the kid thing at all .
for real ?
aw , man .
all right .
i' m so sorry .
so it' s not gonna happen ?
no .
he changed his mind about what he wants .
why ?
just because .
you made him mad , didn' t you ?
not intentionally .
look, you guys .
there will be other opportunities .
no , there won' t .
let' s go , y' all .
this is wack .
oh , you' re funny , right ?
okay .
what happened to your big dance career ?
it' s weak , man .
thug life , baby .
yo .
that' s what it is .
i like those .
yo .
go cop those for me , man .
let' s move .
come on , go .
come on , ladies .
let me see it .
five , six , seven , eight .
turn .
front .
back .
lf that' s the girl we heard about , then no way .
i can' t get a job anywhere .
michael' s blackballing me .
you sure about that ?
yeah , and all he has to do is mention he doesn' t want me working .
what kind of clown would do that , stop somebody from earning a living ?
i guess he figures since he gave me my career , he can take it away .
hey .
he didn' t give you anything .
you get hired because you' ve got drive , talent and love for what you do .
that' s a gift from god , not some video director .
the thing is , i was counting on that money .
not for me , for the kids .
that studio could be unbelievable .
it could change their life .
hmm , paying off that balance ?
actually , i came for an extension .
i need more time .
how much ?
i don' t know .
i sort of hit a financial snag .
miss daniels , if i could help you , i would .
but i' ve already agreed to keep this property off the market for two full weeks for you .
that' s the best i can do .
i know it' s a lot of money .
i' m sorry , honey .
we just don' t have it .
and even if we did evelyn , don' t .
even if you did what , ma ?
honey , a commitment like that , you take that on , you are gonna be stuck here forever .
you' il never leave .
oh , i forgot .
i' m supposed to see all the beautiful things in this world .
well , there' s nothing wrong with my wanting that for you .
no , but what about what i want ?
you' re 22 years old .
you don' t know what you want .
you know what i see living in this neighborhood ?
i see kids go from bad homes to bad schools and back again .
and i' ve seen you unlock a door to a place where those kids can feel safe .
maybe i' m dumb because i haven' t been to paris or milan or wherever , but to me , it doesn' t get much better than that .
it was everything i always wanted .
but when i had got it , it felt like nothing , less than nothing .
and now losing it feels even worse .
i' m not looking for sympathy .
i just need someone to talk to , someone i know and trust .
i' m so sorry , gina .
i totally let you down .
do you think you could ever trust me again ?
i don' t know .
maybe .
you' re my girl .
you know the first thing i thought when i saw that picture in the paper ?
that hood rat lied to me .
no , that was the second .
that hood rat skipped out on my birthday .
no , that was the third .
what was the first ?
that hood rat went to the black and white party and she did not bring me .
i know you' re in a jam right now , but , honey , you got skills .
and that' s gonna take you places .
i just thought that , you know , being your girl and all , i' d get to go too .
you can .
no , i can' t .
i' m just your friend .
you' re the one with the goods .
you' re the one that people want .
you don' t need me .
you just need to trust and believe in yourself .
like i do .
come here .
don' t worry , baby , you' il find work real soon .
you' re too good not to get hired .
all right ?
i just don' t have the time to wait for people to wake up to that .
i' m gonna lose the building at the end of the month .
lf i can' t earn it , and i can' t borrow it , and i can' t steal it ,
i could raise it .
what do you mean ?
well , i' m trying to get a space for kids , right ?
lf people knew about it , they' d want to help , wouldn' t they ?
yeah , probably .
i could put on a benefit performance .
charge a cover .
get some donated food .
put on a great show .
i could do that .
why couldn' t i do that ?
' cause i don' t have a space , that' s why .
damn it !
come here , mami .
i got an idea .
that' s love .
nah , baby , i got you on my christmas list .
all right ?
one , one .
it' s just off the b. q. e. it used to be a church .
the cat i was just on the phone with , he used to own it .
but in three weeks they' re converting it to office space , so it' s empty now .
lf you want it , you better jump on it .
what' s it like ?
it' s dirty .
it' s old .
but it has a floor , right ?
yeah .
i' il take it .
thank you .
hey , guys .
hi , honey .
what' s up ?
i know what you' re thinking , " what the hell we doing here ?
don' t worry , it' s temporary .
this is what we call a means to an end .
nobody' s gonna give us a space , that much is clear .
so we' re gonna raise the money and buy it , straight up and legal .
y' all ever heard of a benefit performance ?
what do you mean ?
likejerry lewis ?
sort of .
i' m jerry .
you' re the kids .
let' s get to work .

she said you' re getting out tomorrow .
that' s right .
when you do , i want you to come hang with me .
nah .
you could have a good life , benny .
it doesn' t have to be like this .
what do you know ?
you ain' t got no job .
you ain' t got no money .
matter of fact , you ain' t got nothing .
what i got is a clear conscience .
yeah ?
what you gonna buy with that ?
it breaks my heart seeing you selling yourself short like this .
so leave .

let me ask you something .
you know your homies , those guys that got your back ?
yeah ?
how many times they come to visit you ?
you think about that .
i don' t know if this is gonna work , missy .
