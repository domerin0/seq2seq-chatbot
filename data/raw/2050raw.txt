" dear mom , this is my first letter .
we have sea on one side and mountains on the other .
everything is okay with me .
do not worry .
your loving son , lvan .
such a short letter .
got a cigarette ?
i get it .
if you are waiting for the john ... tough luck .
it' il take a while .
souvenir .
how was it ?
why did he bring these russians to the village ?
i want to talk to him .
you know how he is ... always hardheaded .
hey , old bandits !
what' s up ?
what did you shoot them with ?
who ?
our men .
with every kind of weapon .
keep those russians away from the village !
what are they going to do ?
kill us ?
i don' t think so .
these chains cost money , stupid .
they' il sell us .
give us some bread , please !
we' re starving .
how much did you pay for the soldiers ?
nothing .
osman was sure they would die .
don' t keep the russians here .
everybody wants you to kill them .
i had no choice .
my son is in prison in town .
i brought money to buy my son back ... but the commander was afraid to take it .
i' il trade these russians ... for my son ... in two days .
don' t let them ... pull a fast one on you .
it' s better ... if you kill them .
if they try to trick me , i' il suck their blood .
sergeant ?
i don' t understand .
who will want to buy us ?
you ?
nobody will .
the commander will pay for me , though .
it' s my third war with him .
but who needs you ?
i can learn how to kill , too .
it' s too late .
to tell you the truth , they can' t afford it .
our army is too poor ... to pay for both of us .
what about me ?
they' il kill you .
please , wait as long as you can ... before telling my mom .
okay , i' il make a deal .
they' il pay for you , too .
that will be a little bit expensive , though .
by the way ... there' s a little detail i forgot to mention .
say good bye to your balls .
what do you mean ?
these guys don' t think twice .
they just cut your balls off .
have you ever fucked someone ?
sure .
why worry then ?
you already had a good time .
still , it' s too bad .
" too bad .
i' ve had enough of you !
too bad .
by the way , my name is sasha sly .
i get it .
what do you get ?
report your altitude .
200 meters .
going along the river , everything is quiet .
get to 500 and proceed to the site .
roger .
get to 500 and proceed to the site .
how does it look ?
looks normal .
i met a girl in town last week .
we went to her house , had some champagne .
i had my condom on ... when she suddenly falls asleep .
i couldn' t wake her up , she was out cold .
i ran over to her neighbors .
they said she gets those lethargic spells sometimes .
then what happened ?
i took off the condom ... and returned to base .
did she ever wake up ?
how should i know ?
they sleep for years sometimes .
where is the sack ?
put your hands behind your back .
walk straight ahead .
if you hear any shots ... roll over to the rock ... and don' t move .
yes , sir .
stay alert .
still a half hour to go .
i can' t believe they' il trade us .
don' t count on it .
they got no choice .
we might even get a vacation .
for what ?
we' il say we captured ... five guerrilla fighters .
and where are they ?
they escaped .
make it 10 , then .
sounds better .
what if they' re really holding two of our men ?
they never take prisoners .
it doesn' t look good .
why ?
shut up .
did you kill them ?
where are they ?
those bastards didn' t even bring my son !
i' il give you one last chance .
write your mothers ... to come to the commander ... and trade you for my son .
and no tricks !
i won' t write .
write , or i' il cut your throat .
the watch doesn' t work again .
what did i tell you ?
get me some matches in town ... neighbor !
you had better marry again .
your daughter needs a woman' s care .
these russians are dangerous .
it' s none of your business !
you' re a fool .
dead patima was the fool when she agreed to come into your house !
who are your parents ?
mom' s an actress , and dad is a general .
where do they live ?
in the north .
that' s far away .
and yours ?
i have no father .
mother is a teacher .
she will surely come .
how do you spell " deodorant " ?
d e o d o r a n t.
i want them to send me a package .
do you need anything ?
no .
that' s all , then .
stop !
papers !
where are you going ?
to the commander .
how long does the mail take ?
about 10 days .
who empties the postbox ?
him .
i do .
come with me .
make sure they get there .
don' t worry .
hello , uncle boris .
hello , uncle abdul .
what' s new ?
how is your health ?
what brought you here ?
do you need your boots repaired ?
no , thank you .
i have a favor to ask .
ask .
if a russian woman asks for me ... tell her how to find me .
i know where to find you .
have a good day .
bye .
i have a good friend .
will you marry him ?
yes or no ?
i will marry him .
do you have a dowry ?
this silver necklace and two russian slaves .
and dust of three roads ... and a rat' s tail !
no one wants to marry you ?
no .
it' s a present ... for you .
thank you .
it' s time to get out of here .
we have to get the chains off , or we' il die .
why did you do that ?
shut up .
that is enough , hasan .
let' s take a break .
you are not deaf .
what is this " mm mm " ?
don' t you have a tongue ?
did they cut your tongue off ?
and your balls , too ?
gilin , would you rather keep your balls or your tongue ?
fucking bandit !
he could have killed us .
good !
here comes lunch .
why did that man shoot at us ?
he wants to kill you .
we are not too popular here .
two of his sons died in the war .
the third works for the russian police .
who cut out hasan' s tongue ?
russians .
of course , russians .
his wife left him for a geologist .
hasan went after her ... found her and killed her .
he served time in prison in siberia .
but he couldn' t keep his mouth shut .
so they cut his tongue out .
he loves to sing .
is he your relative ?
his wife was my sister .
i hear you loved to sing .
so sing for us , why don' t you ?
i will sing along .
i' ve heard the tune before .
but i can' t remember the words .
do you ?
why are you sad ?
father said if your mothers are not here within 10 days ... he will kill you .
they will come .
you are a good man , hasan .
why don' t you let us go ?
" dear mom , i' ve been captured .
" don' t worry .
" abdul murat wants to trade us for his son .
" he treats us well .
" but if you can , come here soon .
" don' t tell anyone about my letter .
abdul , you have kept the russians too long .
i know .
people don' t approve of you .
sasha , my mom will get the letter .
and then what ?
then you will get a screwdriver up your ass .
would you come back here ?
no .
i would come back .
in new camouflage .
you' il have your flame thrower ... and i' il have my submachine gun .
we' il enter this courtyard ...
abdul and hasan will come to meet us ... and they will remain forever in that courtyard .
the girl will invite us into the house .
we have never been inside the house .
i don' t want to kill them .
you have to , vanya .
it' s war .
she waits on the two russians .
keeps bringing them water .
if you say that again , you will be sorry .
what' s going on ?
sasha , let me go to the window .
now what do you want ?
you' re always in my face !
i want to look out the window .
do whatever you want !
what' s so interesting out there ?
why are you such a psycho ?
it' s my birthday today .
happy birthday !
maybe we should try to get out of here .
i' m ready .
fuck !
i think that' s it .
i see that .
what do you like , red or white ?
i prefer vodka .
right .
i have a great idea .
after the war , we open a bar here .
we will call it " hasan' s bar .
god , it stinks here .
i joined the army because i was stupid ...
loved guns , and needed money .
then i began ... to like it .
everyone told me i should be an actor .
i am very talented .
the bolshoi theatre invited me to play hamlet .
look what else i found .
we won' t get out of here today .
i' m totally fucked up .
i will get you out of here .
hasan , come here .
let' s have a drink .
it' s against their traditions .
then why are these bottles here ?
drink , or we will be upset !
i never thought you would do it .
what a surprise !
can you dance , hasan ?
watch us while we' re still alive !
vanya , are you a soldier ?
at attention !
draw your swords !
here , i fixed it .
it really works .
if our country calls us all as one we will go to war and we will fight to the last drop of blood for our homeland
hit me .
look me in the eye .
you have to yell louder , vanya .
my mom probably got the letter ... and is on her way .
maybe so .
when i was 4 ...
i fell into an abandoned well .
everybody looked for me , but it was my mom who found me .
she cried all day .
then she spent the next week ... filling up the well with sand .
can you imagine that ?
she' s so emotional .
what about yours ?
who knows ?
she might be .
i am from an orphanage .
who did you write the letter to ?
to the cook .
what a gal !
died 15 years ago .
otherwise , she would have come .
she fell and her head split open .
just like that .
come on .
you think i' m lying ?
why didn' t you tell me before ?
i' m telling you now .
where did you get this bird ?
lvan gave it to me .
is living with me so hard ?
do you know that i love you ?
i love you from the bottom of my heart .
my son is here in prison .
i must see the commander .
get him .
they are bandits .
you think i didn' t try to arrange a trade ?
i did .
i took a platoon , a helicopter ... but they never showed up .
they didn' t want to trade .
they wanted to ambush us .
you think i' il let you and the prisoner ... go for a stroll , arm in arm ?
they' il dupe you .
you can' t trust anyone here , not even children .
soldiers traded grenades for hash ... and kids threw the grenades back at them .
calm down .
mother !
try to understand .
we have casualties every day .
how do i get to soviet street ?
hello .
hello .
please sit down .
you need your shoes repaired ?
no , thank you .
i' m looking for abdul murat .
i know him .
come here .
take her to the teahouse .
abdul murat will find you there .
thank you .
good bye .
give me two bottles of vodka .
soldier ... give me the money .
keep the change .
where are your prisoners ?
don' t you know our laws ?
they are mine .
those are your laws .
these are mine .
give me the prisoners !
take out the prisoners .
hasan ... take them out .
move !
you look familiar to me .
recognize me now ?
move .
i remember .
give me the rifle .
why don' t you ask me where they are taking us ... what they will do with us ?
it figures .
probably nothing good .
keep walking .
there are russian mines here .
go find them .
but it' s dark .
go , or i will shoot you .
abdul ... take off the chains or we will blow up !
the keys are at home .
they will blow up .
who cares ?
we need to get through .
quiet .
it' s here .
is that all ?
no .
it' s only the first one .
good job !
take it .
well , guys ...
i was sure you would blow to pieces .
it' s your second birthday .
drink , relax , be my guests .
nobody touches you .
my word .
kid !
you want to wrestle my nephew ?
let me .
you are old .
let' s see the young one .
take off his chains .
what should i do ?
yell louder .
come here !
come on .
i give up !
take him away !
for you .
thank you .
they make a beautiful sound .
it' s my grandmother' s .
it' s very old .
wolf faces , horns ... apple seeds ... poppy buds .
you are very pretty .
dina .
go home .
take care of the house .
i will be back tomorrow .
the russian' s mother wants to meet you .
i told her to wait .
45 ...
46 ...
47 ...
48 ...
turn it up .
... 49 .
wake me up in an hour .
tell me where we will meet .
i will tell you when everything is ready .
i know your son is a teacher .
i am a teacher , too .
it doesn' t matter now .
we are enemies .
i understand .
but can i trust you ?
you have no choice .
i could only open one lock .
we' il figure it out later .
just in case .
i have a son in chita .
he' s not well .
i send him money .
the commander will give you the address .
all right .
private gilin , good luck .
give it to me !
let' s go .
how are the nuts ?
fine .
watching after a herd with one bullet !
it looks so old .
can it fire ?
better than a new one .
put it down before anything happens .
i didn' t do anything .
remind me never to run off with you again .
don' t turn around .
sanya !
shut up !
put the rifle on the ground .
put your hands behind your head .
who killed the shepherd ?
i did .
take the young one back to abdul .
i' il take the other one .
gilin !
thank you .
don' t come here anymore .
why not ?
ask the old lady , your neighbor .
why ?
because it stinks here .
you are like a dog now .
it' s not a shame for a dog to smell bad .
were you cold last night ?
yes .
luckily , it didn' t rain .
it won' t rain today .
lots of fireflies are out tonight .
so , did you get married yet ?
no .
i would marry you .
we cannot marry .
i can get married next year .
we marry early here .
did you like that ?
how are you doing ?
pretty shitty .
how about you ?
what about me ?
i' m dead .
but i like it .
everything is peaceful now .
sanya .
how will i make it without you ?
you can come with me .
no , thanks .
as you wish .
by the way , i forgot again .
what' s your name ?
are you the russian who fixes clocks ?
or is he the one who is already dead ?
i' m the one .
can you fix my clock ?
i won' t have the time .
what kind of life is this ?
nobody has time to fix clocks .
stop .
papers ?
where are you going ?
to see my son .
he' s a policeman here .
all right .
hello .
i brought the money .
this one .
over here .
stay here .
really good caviar .
fishermen brought it .
i' il tell you what else is good here .
lots of fruit .
yes , we have many different fruits .
but i don' t want to live here .
nobody likes us here .
and after this war ... they will like us even less .
who likes each other in a war ?
you call this a war ?
attack , retreat .
make peace , make war .
no army can take this .
what do you want ?
i want to see my son , mamed .
wait here .
the old man here says he' s mamed' s father .
send him in !
mamed , take charge of the prisoners .
there' s one guy i want to keep aside .
two of our men have been taken hostage .
the mother of one of them came here and says she' s made a deal .
let her try .
sometimes it works .
how are you , father ?
get him !
everybody get down !
mother , get out of the way !
stop !
where are you going ?
get the others into the van !
shoot , or he' il escape !
i have bad news , abdul .
your son is dead .
my brother , dzarahmat , is dead .
you have one more night to live .
help me .
i cannot .
you have to die .
i don' t want to .
usually they throw the enemy' s body to the jackals .
but i will bury yours .
bring me the key .
nobody' s here .
i will dig a wide grave for you .
and you will see ... the angel of death .
i' il put my necklace in the grave ... as your wedding gift .
maybe your soul will find a bride in heaven .
i don' t think so .
don' t cry , mother .
we' il make them pay , i promise .
are you glad to see me ?
yes .
don' t kill any more people , promise ?
hurry !
go !
don' t stay here .
i can' t .
they' il never forgive you for helping me .
come here .
don' t kill him .
why aren' t you crying over your brother ?
they killed him .
now i' il kill this russian .
go home !
let' s go .
keep walking , and don' t look back .
vanya , what' s the matter with you ?
look back !
i' m here !
stop !
don' t do it !
when it was over , i spent two weeks in the hospital .
then i was discharged and sent home .
mom cried all the way home .
she kept telling the woman next to her ... how lucky she was .
i want to see them in my dreams ... all those people whom i grew to love ... and will never meet again .
but they just won' t come to me .
