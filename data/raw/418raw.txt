oh , yeah , we got this puppy .
this was a good idea .
elliot looks a little green .
do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass ... that tastes like french vanilla ice cream ?
what ?
i said , do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass ... that tastes like french vanilla ice cream ?
no .
no .
then why are you telling me this bullshit ?
what , do you want to fuck me ?
clarence .
he' s sick , man .
let me handle this , all right ?
look .
you know what ?
just get it straight .
lee is not into taking risks , okay ?
he' s got a couple of guys , he' s been dealing with them for years .
they' re reliable , they' re dependable , and they' re safe .
riddle me this , batman " .
if you' re so much in love , what are you doing here ?
i' m sure you' ve got better things to do than hanging around on a roller coaster .
your guy is interested because with that much shit ... he could play joe fucking hollywood until the wheels come off .
he can sell it , he can snort it ... he can play santa claus with it .
at the price he' s paying he' il be able to throw it around .
he' il be everybody' s best friend .
i' m not putting him down .
it' s his money , let him do what he wants .
but don' t expect us to hang around ... waiting for you guys to grow some guts , all right ?
jesus .
yeah , hello .
hi , lee .
elliot , it' s sunday .
can you tell me why i' m talking to you on sunday ?
don' t i see enough of you all week ?
i' m with that party that you wanted me to get together with , lee .
you know who i' m talking about ?
i don' t believe this .
why are you talking to me ... on my phone about that ?
well , because i' m standing with the guy , and he insists on talking to you .
what , are you out of your fucking mind ?
he said that if i didn' t get you on the phone , that he would leave ....
hello , lee , it' s clarence .
at last , we speak .
first , i want to tell you i' m a big fan of yours .
that' s why i want to open dr. zhivago in la .
and i need you and your abilities to distribute it .
i don' t know .
dr. zhivago is a pretty big movie .
the biggest movie you' ve dealt with .
we' re talking a lot of film here .
a man would be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that .
and , lee , you' re no idiot .
i' m not saying i' m not interested .
it' s just , being a distributor is not what i do .
i' m a movie producer , you know ?
i' m here to make good movies , nothing more ... and nothing , well , maybe less , sometimes .
hey !
choose a fucking lane !
not you , just an idiot ...
don' t give me the finger !
i' il fucking have you killed !
so , bottom line is i' m not paramount .
you know what i' m saying ?
i got a select few distributors .
i buy their little movies and i accomplish what i want and i get out of there .
very business like , very easy , and very little risk .
we' re talking dr. zhivago .
it' il be packing them in .
for a year ... two years you won' t have to deal with anybody else' s movie but mine .
nobody' s but yours .
well , what' s the rush here ?
i want to be able to announce the deal at cannes .
if i had time for a courtship , i would .
i' d take you out , hold your hand , kiss your cheek .
but i' m not in that position .
i need to know right now if you and i are in bed together or not .
if you want my movie , you must come to terms ... with your fear and desire .
fear and desire , huh , clarence ?
don' t you know that my films have grossed more than $2 . 8 billion ?
let me talk to elliot .
you want to talk to elliot ?
let me talk to elliot .
elliot .
he wants to talk to you .
hi , lee .
elliot , where do you know this guy from ?
he' s a friend of dick' s , remember ?

it covers the whole spectrum .
talks to the fans ... people who grew up with him and love his music .
then , there' s the fanatics .
right ?
i don' t know about you , but they give me the creeps .
yeah , yeah , i see what you mean .
i mean , look at her .
looks like she fell off the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down .
now the first time you kill somebody , that' s the hardest .
i don' t give a shit if you' re fuckin ' wired up , or jack the ripper .
remember that guy in texas ?
the guy up in that fucking tower , killed all them people ?
i bet you green money , the first little black dot he took a beat on ... that was the bitch of the bunch .
first one is tough .
no fucking fooling .
the second one ain' t no fuckin ' mardi gras ... but it' s better than the first ' cause you still feel the same thing ... except it' s more diluted .
you know , it' s better .
i threw up on the first one , you believe that ?
then the third one .
the third one is easy , you level right off .
that' s no problem .

it' s all fun until you get caught .
now we got you .
okay , mr. elliot , fucking actor , you just made the big time .
you' re no longer an extra ...
a bit player . a supporting actor .
you' re a fucking star .
you' il be playing your one man show ... nightly for the next two fucking years !
for a captive audience .
you' il get out in a few years and meet some old lady .
you' il marry and be understanding to your wife' s needs ... because you' il know what it' s like to be a woman .
you' il only want to fuck her ass ' cause her pussy won' t be tight enough .
good point , detective .
right ?
fucking faggot !
krinkle , this is it , and it' s all ours .
i mean , talk about falling into something ....
would you shut up !
i can' t understand shit .
what happened ?

okay , all right .
patrol car pulls a guy over for speeding .
suspect is covered with coke ... so they bring him to me and nicholson .
nicholson and l .
what' s the difference ?
we go to work on him .
we know something is strange ' cause he ... is fucking stupid , and he' s got a big bag of coke , and it' s uncut .
and you won' t believe what he' s got to say .
seems a cop from some department , stole ... $500, 000 worth of coke from the property cage ....
he sat on the shit for a year and a half .
now , the cop' s got this weirdo ...
suspect' s words . to front for him .
our guy , elliot blitzer , is making a deal between them and his boss ... big time fucking movie producer named lee donowitz .
he did coming home in a body bag .
a vietnam movie ?
yeah .
good fucking movie .
fucking a. great fucking movie .
so , do you believe him ?
i believe he believes him .
this guy is too rattled to be lying .
he' d roll over on his mom , dad , his two pantied granny ... and the king of siam if he had anything on him .
this guy was a sissy .
this rabbit will do anything not to do any time .
you know what he' il do ?
he' il wear a wire .
he' il wear a wire ?
he' il wear a wire , we talked to him .
dirty cops , we got to get lnternal affairs on this .
i don' t care who you bring in .
you can bring in the state enlisted ... the ghost of steve mcqueen , ten roman gladiators .
i don' t give a shit as long as me and todd get credit for the bust .
listen , we found him .
we just want the fucking collar .
that' s it .
end of story .
you got it .
did i ever tell you how much i hate airports ?
see , i used to live by one back in dearborn , you know .
really frustrating living next to an airport when you don' t got shit .
and all day long i' m seeing and hearing people doing exactly ... what i want to be doing , but couldn' t .
what ?
starting new lives , leaving detroit , vacations , business trips ... fun , fun , fun .
knowing us , we can jump on any of those planes ... and go anywhere we want .
gives me a whole new outlook .
love how it works out .
you' re not kidding .
we got lives to start over .
we should go somewhere where we can start from scratch .
i' ve been in america all my life .
i' d like to see what tv in other countries is like .
where do you think we should go , my little turtle dove ?
cancn .
cancn , why cancn ?
it' s got a nice ring to it .
sounds like a movie .
clarence and alabama go to cancn , don' t you think ?
in my movie , darling , you get top billing .
don' t worry about nothing , all right ?
it' s all going to work out for us .
we deserve it .

anything happens , we' il be there like fucking gangbusters ?
you must remember something .
you don' t want to go to jail , right ?
no .
i don' t want to go to jail .
so , what do we got to do ?
we got to put your boss in jail , okay ?
you do that , and you got to show in court , beyond any reasonable doubt ... that this respectable man in the hollywood community ... is dealing cocaine .
we must prove it , and you must do it .
that' s what we' re doing here .
you' re going to be okay , you won' t get hurt .
okay ?
so what you got to do is to get him ... to admit on tape , all right ?
that he' s buying this coke .
okay , champ ?
get a hold of yourself .
okay .
i' m going to get some coffee .
alabama , you really got that playing basketball ?
yes , i got an elbow right in the eye .
then ...
i got hurled the ball when i' m not looking .
wham !
right in my face .
you should be careful .
i should .
what the fuck did you bring that for ?
in case .
in case of what ?
i don' t know , what do you want me to say ?
look , clarence , lee donowitz is not a pimp .
i know that , but one thing this week has taught me ... it' s better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it .
there he is .
elliot , your motivation is to stay out of jail .
easy , easy , easy .
hi .
hi .
i guess it' s about that time .
yeah .
here we go .
you' re an actor .

it' s a helicopter .
sorry , it' s nothing personal .
clarence .
there' il be no need to search me , daredevil .
all you' il find is this right here .
now what compelled you to bring that along ?
the same thing that compelled you guys ... to bring heavy artillery to a business meeting .
i' il take that .
well , you' re going to have to .
oh .
hi .
everybody' s here .
elliot .
who' s who ?
that' s dick on the end there .

boris , shut the fuck up !
come on , everybody , don' t be shy .
come on in .
okay , lee ?
lee .
lee .
that' s right , lee .
i just gotta tell you , i really am a big fan .
coming home ln a body bag is my favorite movie .
after apocalypse now , i think it' s the best vietnam movie ever made .
wow .
thank you very much , clarence .
lee .
what ?
this guy is packing .
really .
well , i mean , i' ve been pretty scared about this whole thing .
i' m fairly confident you' re here to do business , so look .
i don' t want to be a wise guy .
if you want , i' il lay my gun on the table .
it' s up to you .
no , i don' t think that' s necessary .
boris , be nice .
make everybody some coffee .
okay ?
a pleasure to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
honey , sit down .
relax , relax .
elliot , you look like shit .
oh , i' m sorry .
i mean , it' s completely disgusting .
if i could get a quick signature , it would be great .
whatever bonnie wants .
like my dailies , there , clar ?
is that what these are ?
you like them ?
they' re great .
they better be , they cost me enough .
what did that day cost me ? $357, 000 .
elliot , i swear to god , somebody is stealing from me .
what' s this one called , anyway ?
it' s a sequel to body bag .
really ?
we don' t have a title yet , but what does joe like ?
body bags two .
oh .
that' s imaginative .
i' ve got more taste in my penis .
this guy is really fucking funny .
most of these movies that win a lot of oscars , i can' t stand them .
they' re safe , geriatric , coffee table dog shit , you know ?
we park our cars in the same garage .
it' s all right .
all they make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books .
mad max , that' s a movie .
the good the bad and the ugly ...
rio bravo , those are movies .
and coming home in a body bag , that was a movie .
it was the only movie that won oscars with balls ...
i mean , since deerhunter .
i don' t believe you .
what , do you like a little coffee with your sugar , or what ?
lee , i' m not satisfied until the spoon stands straight up .
give me a coffee , will you ?
my uncle roger and my uncle jerry , who were in nam ... saw coming home in a body bag .
they said that' s the most accurate vietnam film ... they had ever seen .
i' il tell you .
when veterans in that war say that about my project ... it makes the whole thing worthwhile .
here' s to you .
my friend , oops , i just met you .
you know why ?
i think because we got the same interests .
and you know what i' d like to do right now ?
i' d like to see dr. zhivago .
where is it ?
is there a fucking doctor in the house , or what ?
hang on a second .
when you see this , you are going to shit .
i better .
what' s the guy' s name ?
donowitz .
lee , that' s all practically uncut .
if you so desire ... you can cut that a lot more .
don' t worry , i' il desire .
get me another cup of coffee , will you ?
me , too , boris .
i have to hand it to you , clarence , this is not nose garbage .
this is quality stuff .
perfect merchandise .
the only trouble is ... when i' m offered a deal that' s too good to be true ... it' s because it' s a lie .
convince me you' re on the level .
convince him .
if he don' t bite , we have nothing but possession .
we got lots of sandwich shit back there , make something .
we got pastrami , nice rye ....
anybody want anything ?
you , got any aspirin ?
yeah , sure .
get him that .
well , lee , it' s like this .
you' re getting this bargain because i don' t know what i' m doing .
you' re used to dealing with professionals which i' m not .
i' m a rank amateur .
what the fuck is going on ?
what' s going on , joe ?

and a million bucks !

and fast !
i am going to do this bitch , motherfuckers !
amid the chaos of that day ... when all i could hear was the thunder of gunshots ... and all i could smell was the violence in the air ...
i look back and am amazed ... that my thoughts were so clear and true .
that three words went through my mind endlessly .
repeating themselves like a broken record .
you' re so cool .
you' re so cool .
you' re so cool .
and sometimes clarence asks me what would i have done if he had died .
if that bullet had been two inches more to the left .
to this , i always smile .
as if i' m not going to satisfy him with a response .
but i always do .
i tell him of how i would want to die .
but that the anguish and the want of death would fade ...
like the stars at dawn .
and that things would be much like they are now .
perhaps .
except maybe i wouldn' t have named our son ...
elvis .
