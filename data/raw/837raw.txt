panama .
panama ?
best i could do , andrew ... ... in the circumstances , given your sins .
they were baying for blood .
i argued your case .
for his long service , his fine brain in the balance ... ... against the gambling debts ... ... the blown cover and the wives .
the wives .
so , a last chance .
panama .
keep the head down ?
serve out my time ?
not quite , andrew .
the canal , vital artery .
there is work to be done .
but for god' s sake , be careful out there , man .
there' s a nasty web of money laundering ... ... drug trafficking and corruption .
really ?
there are only 200 resident brits in panama .
butyou can surely ferret out one or two ... ... who can gain you access to the corridors ofpower .
look , look !
the bridge of the americas .
you know , eversince the canal cut them in half ... ... this bridge is now the only link ... ... between north and south america .
think about it !
the way i see it , we all have a dream of ourselves ... ... that we could be more than we are .
well , pendel and braithwaite are here to help you realize that dream ... ... in the savile row tradition .
let' s try this one now .
oh , yeah , i guess this is kind of ....
i thought you' d like that one , sir .
mr. connery' s choice .
as soon as i saw you i thought , " who does he remind me of ?
and that' s it . ln the build too .
golfer' s shoulders .
how about that , uncle benny ?
you' ve got the fluence , harry .
i' ve always said it , and you have .
you' re the outright best tailor in the world .
barnone .

tyger , tyger , burning bright ln the forest of the night

shalom .
shalom .
look at your hair !
oh , what immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful cemetery
no , " symmetry . " symmetry .
i still don' t know what it means .
did you see the news last night ?
yes , i did .
your people want their canal back .
not my people , ernesto .
they' re rabid , right wing senators .
do you know what they are ?
say it .
assholes .
you see ?
turn around .
it' s only a tad , ramon .
lf you want to look good in my suit , lose weight and grow a foot .
come to the shop .
we can ease it a little .
okay .
so , what are we gonna do about the overdraft , harry ?
you tell me , ramon .
you have to think about selling the farm , harry .
sell it ?
it' s a gold mine , ramon .
angelo' s turning it around .
he' s a very good man , ramon .
dedicated .
i hear you got a water problem .
did have , ramon , did have .
i put that right .
now , it flows like ....
water .
exactly , ramon .
maybe you shouldn' t have bought it , eh ?
on your advice , ramon .
fair' s fair .
the bank wishes to see a substantial reduction ... ... on the outstanding sum by the end of next month .
otherwise ... ... we have to call it in .
what ?
the whole lot ?
but of course the whole lot .
you are my friend .
i hate to do this , but my hands are tied .
what can i say ?
what am i going to tell louisa ?
i bought it with her inheritance .
well , you' re the storyteller , harry .
you' re an angel .
someone to see you .
oh , yes ?
who ?
new customer , he say .
hi .
name' s osnard .
i phoned .
mr. osnard .
harry pendel .
very happy to meet you , sir .
no offense , but i was hoping to see mr. braithwaite .
no chance of that , i' m sorry to say , sir .
my late partner has been dead and gone these many years .
though his exacting standards are very much alive and well .
glad to hear that .
he dressed my father , you know .
back in his savile row days .
well , i never !
now that' s a first , i don' t mind admitting .
father to son , savile row to panama city .
did you hear that ?
i thought you' d be surprised .
surprised , sir , and delighted .
marta , put mr. osnard down as an old customer .
arthur braithwaite made for his father .
now , if you' d care to come this way , mr. osnard .
what in hell happened to her ?
ln the bad old days , would that be ?
noriega' s time ?
rough justice meted out ?
lf you' d care to take a seat , sir .
thank you .
we call this the club room .
many of our gentlemen spend time here ... ... in the lunch hour and at the day' s end .
and why not ?
what did you have in mind , sir , exactly ?
i thought i' d start with a few lounge suits .
see how they go .
after that , well , the " full monty , " as old braithwaite used to say .
i see .
very good , sir .
pity the expression' s been hijacked .
means quite the other thing now .
so they tell me , sir .
bollock naked , in fact .
quite so , sir .
money' s no problem .
take a look at these , sir .
see what takes your fancy .
they' re all the right weight for this diabolical climate .
seven ounces of nicely breathing , finest worsted .
about all a man could or should put up with .
how about this one ?
alpaca , am i right ?
very good , sir .
perfect .
and exactly what i should' ve picked .
given that money' s no object ?
so , what' s next ?
ah !
the sun !
vital statistics .
please step this way .
certainly .
lf i could ask you to slip off your jacket .
thank you , sir .
you were noriega' s tailor , weren' t you , in his time ?
i' m sorry , sir , is that a problem ?
not necessarily .
smelly little bugger , was he ?
lf i may , sir .
forty .
and the waist ....
what' s the damage ?
a very creditable 34 plus .
plus what ?
plus lunch , put it that way , sir .
very good .
do you ever miss it ?
the old country ?
savile row ?
the row .
well , now ... ... l do and i don' t .
nothing beats it , but when i was there ... ... l always felt very much in old arthur braithwaite' s shadow .
though it was arthur braithwaite who encouraged me to spread my wings .
good old boy , arthur , was he ?
one of the old school , sir .
now , if i might ....
very good , sir .
do we dress right or left ?
most gentlemen favor left these days .
don' t think it' s political .
never know where the bloody thing is .
bobs about like a windsock .
you were saying ?
saying , sir ?
braithwaite .
telling you to spread your wings .
yes , of course .
i remember it like yesterday .
i was cutting a nice muted check hacking jacket for lord braeburn .
finest mohair , dash of cashmere .
i looked up and he was looking at me from the doorway .
arthur braithwaite , that is .
he was a big man , imposing .
he had a presence .
it' s hard to put it into words .
it was the moustache .
moustache ?
bloody great bushy job , soup all over it .
there was no moustache in my day .
i can see it now .
bright brown .
i think we' re being rumbled , harry .
admit nothing .
deny all .
i think your memory' s playing tricks .
you' re thinking of another man and awarding his moustache to braithwaite .
go on .
harry , " he says to me , " i think you' ve earned your spurs .
how would you feel about taking my name ... ... and tradition to the new world ?
i' m talking about a full partnership .
i don' t mind saying , there were tears in my eyes .
you' ve practically got tears in mine .
thank you , sir .
i' ve never heard such a load of bullshit in my life .
come and sit down , harry .
it' s all right .
i' m your fairy godmother .
the thing is , harry , i know who you are .
more accurately , i know who you aren' t .
i don' t know what you' re saying .
it' s all right .
relax .
because i know .
you' re 90601 7 pendel .
six years for arson , served two and a half .
learnt your tailoring in the slammer .
lnsurance scam , wasn' t it ?
set fire to a warehouse for your uncle benny .
they caught you with the matches in your hand .
you' ve never been near savile row .
braithwaite is your uncle benny ... ... raised from the dead , born again and given a size nine halo .
upon release , you did a runner to panama with your uncle benny' s help .
built up a fine business .
married the daughter of an american canal engineer .
well respected man .
but you owe the bank 50, 000 , thanks to that farm .
you' ve put in the shop and the house as collateral .
not wise , harry .
not wise at all .
i can almost hear the creditors banging on the door .
who are you ?
i' m andy osnard .
new boy at the british embassy , finding my way around town .
strictly between us ... ... l' m ml . 6' s man in panama .
it' s dark and lonely work , like oral sex .
but someone has to do it , harry .
i' m opening up a little network .
keeping an eye on the canal .
so , what' s that got to do with me ?
what gives you the right to come here ... ... sandbag me with my past after i' ve paid my debt to society ?
cool down .
i' m bonus .
okay .
what do you want ?
your memory .
your " rock of eye .
lsn' t that the expression ?
things you know and don' t even know you know .
highest prices paid .
get out .
now .
off .
don' t be a cunt , harry .
we' re made for each other .
you have debts , i have money .
where' s your patriotism ?
i had it out in prison , without an anesthetic .
there' s five grand there .
say it' s on account of the suits .
call it " entertainment expenses , " anything you like , really .
i want us to get on , harry .
go on .
show me around , is all .
do i have a choice ?
oh , don' t put it like that .
it' s a game .
let' s have some fun , eh ?
hi .
no , nothing much .
well , sure , if you feel you have to .
why not just bring him home ?
i think i' il take him to the club .
not sure .
he' s an odd chap .
no , nothing' s wrong .
your voice sounds funny .
he called it a windsock ?
seor .
good evening , mr. pendel .
must have cost a lot to get in here .
had to be done .
hey , harry , what about my blazer ?
drop by on tuesday , luis .
it' il be ready to try on .
blazers , they all want blazers .
you dress everyone here ?
just about , andy .
so who are " they " ?
who gets to join ?
basically , 30 ruling families , their lawyers and their bankers .
and their tailors , i take it .
harry , they got ali baba , but they missed the 40 thieves .
well , here they are .
so fill me in .
nobody ever loses their reputation in panama .
they hang it in the closet for a bit to get its shape back .
when they put it on again , it' s as good as new .
on the dance floor , rafi domingo .
shipping and drugs .
i could fuck that very easily .
wouldn' t be any pain at all .
a lot have , andy .
a lot wish they had , who haven' t ... ... and one or two have , who wish they hadn' t .
who are those charmers just come in ?
government ministers and the money boys who own them .
at the table , bunch of gentlemen from the loyal opposition .
they come much cheaper , naturally .
welcome to panama .
a casablanca without heroes .
you are pure gold , harry .
hey !
harry !
mickie .
harry .
mickie , i think you' re a touch refreshed !
please , come and sit down .
a man should stand on his feet .
anyone remember that ? !
lsn' t that the next bit ?
never on our knees . " right .
or on our asses .
so who the fuck are you , my friend ?
i' d like you to meet andy osnard .
british embassy .
mickie really is a genuine hero , andy .
one of the few with the guts to stand up to you know who .
mickie , please sit down .
people are staring .
i don' t give a fuck about these fucks .
these are the fucks who kept that fuck noriega in power .
you know what i would do mr. andy , right ?
you know what i would do if i was president ?
what ?
i' d kill every fuck in this room .
all of us .
look at us .
look at us !
we got everything god needed to make paradise .
and what do we do ?
we sell each other .
we sell our country .
we sell it all away !
harry , you take him for a walk .
look at these people , eh !
look at these people .
you sold your souls , you don' t even know it .
stupid !
lf you make any more trouble , i will never cut you another suit .
come on .
i' il take you home .
sorry .
he' s an old friend , you know .
hello , harry .
seor delgado .
buenos noches .
canal commissioner ?
he as clean as they say ?
well , my wife thinks so .
come on , mickie , what is this ?
come on , mickie .
you' re a good man , harry .
the only good men left in panama city are you and me .
that' s all .
you and me .
okay , in you go .
come on .
he has heart , mr. cool .
heart .
come on , now .
call it a night .
so , what' s the story with him ?
mickie ?
he was my first customer .
best looking man in panama .
a god .
till noriega threw him into prison to shut him up .
didn' t bloody well work , did it ?
there' s more to mickie abraxas than meets the eye .
oh , i' m sure there is .
my people don' t care about the glorious past exploits ... ... of some shagged out old wino .
they want the real stuff .
today' s men .
tomorrow' s , not yesterday' s .
we' re not a fucking charity for losers .
i hope i haven' t made a mistake with you .
don' t underestimate mickie abraxas .
so ?
what if i was to tell you he' s still at it ?
at what , exactly ?
he' s still in there .
the silent opposition .
the " silent opposition " ?
he' s never lost touch with ordinary , decent people .
deprived people .
people who are tired of the corruption , the greed .
do you know what the poor call those ?
the cocaine towers .
and our 85 banks ?
the launderettes .
can we buy him ?
mickie ?
never .
but he might allow you to contribute to the cause .
uncle benny , i fill up .
i can' t stop .
i get the wind in my ears .
you' ve got the fluence in full flow and the rock of eye .
but it' s a curse as well as a blessing .
how' d it go ?
fine .
i think .
hey ... ... get in here .
hi .
i missed you .
wait , i' il take my socks off .
i may be some time .
mr. osnard .
ah , andrew osnard .
nigel stormont .
francesca deane .
hello .
welcome to panama .
thank you , ambassador .
please .
i gather you' ve been having a look round already ... ... quite extensively .
yes , indeed .
great spot .
right up my street .
and how should we describe your street , andrew ... ... to the curious ?
i usually say i' m in information technology .
oh , you' re one of them .
a friend .
that' s right .
i' m a friend .
oh , my dear , but it' s a huge secret .
or it was , until osnard blubbed it .
i mean , i' m barely allowed to know it .
not the osnard got drummed out of madrid ?
foreign minister' s wife , wasn' t it ?
not his wife .
mistress .
there are some things i won' t do for england .
got your picture in the paper , didn' t it ?
hence my posting to panama .
what was your crime ?
coffee ?
thank you .
help yourself .
ls it just exile , or do you have a purpose here ?
sure .
the boys at home are concerned that the world' s biggest trade gateway ... ... doesn' t fall into the wrong hands ... ... now that it' s in the wrong hands .
forgive me .
don' t want to seem presumptuous ... ... but i doubt you' il find anything they don' t know ... ... from our regular embassy briefings .
know about the silent opposition ?
there you go .
you' re a fast worker .
see something worth having , go after it .
may i ask at what point we here at the embassy ... ... will get sight of your product ?
my boss says no local sharing unless he gives the nod ... ... but i' m not really bothered about that .
say , the four of us in this room ?
i' d have no problem with that .
well , all that seems very satisfactory .
nigel ?
francesca ?
good to have you with us , andrew .
good to be here .
francesca will show you to your office .
yes .
it' s a bit on the poky side , i' m afraid .
bit on the poky side' s fine with me .
we thought you' d be out and about a lot .
here we are .
what are you listening to ?
the sea .
bloody thing' s been sitting in the warehouse all its life .
stuck on one combo .
tumblers all shot .
gotcha !
are you quite sure that it was locked in the first place ?
i' m staying at the gamboa rain forest resort till the apartment' s ready .
come out on sunday .
spot of lunch .
swim in the lake .
see how it goes .
i think i' m busy on sunday .
you' re right .
it was open .
just tight from lack of use .
the ambassador' s asked me to brief you ... ... in case there' s anything you don' t already know .
noriega formed these so called " dignity battalions .
dingbats .
they were to beat the dignity out of anyone remotely critical of noriega .
it was dr. frankenstein , george bush ... ... who created this monster ... ... when he was head of the cla .
and when noriega' s ... ... drug running and brutality got too much , even for the cla ... ... it was george , now president bush , who decided to take him out .
and just to make sure ... ... they fire bombed a big chunk of the old city .
sadly , that' s where the anti noriega rebels were .
the handful that noriega hadn' t banged up already .
so no more opposition , silent or otherwise .
burnt ... ... scattered ... ... fled .
or risen again from the ashes .
okay , okay , okay .
everybody , here we go .
sorry .
mickie !
come in .
sorry about the other night .
i' m going through a bad patch .
ls it money , mickie ? ls it ?
maybe i can help .
you ?
you got worse debts than me .
mr. farmer , huh ?
do you still keep in touch , you know ... ... with any of the students , the fighters , from the old days ?
no , they' re all lawyers now .
bankers .
haven' t you heard ?
we got a democracy .
there' s still a lot to fight for , mickie .
i haven' t got the stomach for it .
i get the shakes when i see a cop .
unless i' m drunk , and then i want to hit him .
either way ....
what about marta' s people ?
they loved you .
they looked up to you .
you should give up on me , harry .
i' m a lost cause .
how much do you owe , mickie ?
owe to the casino ?
to you ?
all of it .
all in .
come on .
not much change out of 20 grand .
i' il get it for you , mickie .
and i' m gonna make you a new suit .
a lovely silk and mohair herringbone .
okay ?
okay .
okay .
seor pendel ?
what have i done wrong , marta ?
nothing .
that' s the problem .
look at these accounts .
your friend rafi domingo .
two months overdue .
carry it till next month .
he' s a good customer .
he' s a shit .
he made all his money under noriega .
i' m going to charge him interest .
you can' t do that .
yes , i can .
you' re worried they won' t like you if you make them pay .
it' s a tradition .
gentlemen keep tailors waiting for money .
gentlemen ?
find me one .
your mr. osnard isn' t one , that' s for sure .
what does he want ?
a suit .
this is me , harry .
he' s looking for information .
be nice to him .
no sulks .
promise ?
he' s a devil .
who says ?
his eyes say .
i' m just having a bit of a natter with him .
don' t look at me like that , marta .
i' m just a tailor .
no , harry , not just a tailor .
you are a dreamer .
which is why i have to watch over you .
oh , speak of the devil .
mr. osnard !
how' s my suit coming along then ?
harry , this is gonna be something special .
a poem , is it ?
great body .
as long as her face is turned away when you' re fucking her .
marta' s decent .
she' s been in some very bad places .
oh , yeah ?
such as ?
here .
under noriega .
she stood up when the rest of us were lying down .
that' s why they did her face for her .
are her sacred causes still intact ?
she' d never budge .
not marta .
so she' s one of them .
one of who ?
the silent opposition .
absolutely .
harry , stop .
i can' t .
what is she ?
their chief of ops ?
head spook ?
she' s more .
much more .
how much ?
you press me too hard , andy .
sweetheart , you haven' t even felt me yet .
think " farm .
she' s their joan of arc .
their spiritual leader , bar none .
you' re too much , harry .
can i have her ?
every penny you give her goes to the cause ... ... without commission or deduction of any kind .
how much ?
for the pulse and soul of the silent opposition ?
for marta ?
mickie needs 20 grand to activate his units .
marta should get the same .
yeah , i think we can swing that .
thank you , mr. osnard .
london' s tickled pink with this silent opposition of yours .
how is the farm , by the way ?
don' t ask .
know who your neighbor is ?
the guy who' s cutting off access to your water ?
he' s not a person , he' s an absentee landlord ... ... and a corporation in miami .
and a prick .
you know where he banks ?
with your chum ramon .
not to put too fine a point on it , he is your chum ramon .
well , ramon owns two thirds .
mr. x owns the other third .
you know who mr. x is ?
no , i don' t know who mr. x is .
how about your farm manager chap ?
angelo , isn' t it ?
no !
mickie !
marta !
oh , for the love of god !
mickie !
oh , god !
it' s okay .
what time is it ?
it' s 7 : 00 .
i' il make breakfast .
what happened to your diet , mom ?
i' m in denial .
what' s denial ?
a very big river in africa .
ba bum !
thank you .
mom , this girl in school told me mothers who work ... ... feel guilty about their children .
why don' t you ?
maybe because your father is such a good mother .
listen , it' s ballet today .
do not forget your bag .
let' s go .
okay , come on .
are you seeing the president today , dad ?
lndeed .
so we' d better get our skates on .
harold pendel .
this way , mr. pendel .
working .
always working .
he thinks only of panama .
seor pendel .
show me your pass , please .
marco , you know me .
i made you that double breasted mohair .
i' m still waiting for you to pay me for it .
through here .
he' s gonna give you only five minutes , okay ?
your excellency .
welcome back , indeed .
five capitals in one week , i think i read .
paris to tokyo in seven days .
a record for a world class statesman .
pants .
they' il know where panama is then , won' t they ?
we won' t be just a wriggly little worm on the map with a canal , will we ?
vest .
i dispense with the rear buckle as a rule ... ... with your handmade waistcoat , excellency .
too many of my gentlemen report a discomfort to the lower vertebrae ... ... when leaning backward , relishing a postprandial cigar .
jacket .
did we discuss the canal' s future on our travels ... ... if i may be so bold ?
so you want to know something about the canal ?
lf it pleases your excellency .
you' re halfway up it .
i stand upright .
okay , just .
i bend down ... ... my balls are in my ears .
very good , sir .
you make your pants too tight , mr. braithwaite .
harry !
i' ve got a job .
shit , shit , shit !
it' s upstairs .
no .
thank you .
harry , " he says to me , " you make beautiful pants .
when i was a boy , i dreamed of wearing pants like these .
his very words , andy .
to be quite frank , do we have to meet here ?
it' s not very salubrious .
good cover , harry .
they rent the rooms by the hour .
cash .
no questions asked .
no paper trail .
anyone sees you going in , you' re here to get your end away .
same as me .
so that' s it , is it ?
half hour' s tte tte about knickers .
what about the canal ?
did he say anything about his trip ?
he had talks , yes .
constructive discussions , " was his phrase , i believe .
you' re not gonna pay off the farm at this rate .
andy , this is hard for me .
he confides .
a tailor' s like a priest in these situations .
for me , the changing room is as sacred as the confessional .
lips are sealed , eh ?
have you had a chance to make arrangements about the farm , andy ?
well , the money' s there , as long as you deliver .
he' s selling it , andy .
what ?
the canal .
he' s selling it ?
has to .
needs the money .
relieve the poverty . lnfrastructure .
who' s buying ?
who' s buying ?
various interested parties , i believe .
come on .
he mentioned the french , the japanese .
and ?
oh , yeah .
and the chinese .
harry .
andy .
are you pulling my pisser ?
not unless the president' s pulling mine .
this is fucking dynamite .
does he always talk to you like this ?
not always ... ... but mostly .
now this is for the record .
times , names , places .
his actual words , if you remember them .
goose it up a bit .
it' s going straight to the top .
here we go .
what kind of chinese , by the way ?
you know , chinese , like chinese .
oh , fuck' s sake .
i mean , mainland ?
taiwan ?
the both , andy .
the two together .
hand in hand .
it' s something the president' s very proud of ... ... bringing them together , at the same table .
harry , " he says to me , " if it' s all i' m remembered for , then so be it .
i brought reconciliation to the great chinese people ... ... for the betterment of all mankind .
you' ve excelled .
this is a better yarn than arthur braithwaite .
are you implying ?
doesn' t matter what i think .
it plays .
abraxas and marta .
lnstallments ?
payment on results , harry .
and the farm as such , andy ?
looking good .
oh , look at those tits .
yum yum .
you want to pay off the debt ?
with what ?
let' s say i won the lottery , ramon .
and i want to buy your farm from you .
what do you mean , you want to buy my farm ?
i don' t have no farm .
oh , yes , you do , ramon .
i know all about it .
okay .
you won the lottery , you can pay me $3000 an acre .
two .
you' il be paid direct from europe .
i' ve made the necessary arrangements .
you won' t mind if i deduct your tailoring bill ?
it has a bad smell .
that would be the fish .
i' il pay you back .
i' m going to straighten out .
just don' t resent me for doing you a favor .
harry , this is panama , where no good deed goes unpunished .
right .
there' s two ways we can deal with this one , old girl .
darling , why didn' t we ever do this before ?
full on affair now .
observing tight security all round .
see how we like it .
lf we don' t , no one' s the wiser .
i don' t suppose it' s occurred to you that i might prefer someone else ?
ls that a no ?
no .
come and dance .
oh , god , you don' t dance as well , do you ?
as well as what ?
my chaps in london are in a bit of a spin about it .
i understand they' re talking to washington .
lf the canal' s being sold out , how come we never got a whisper of it ?
i' m sure the question is being asked ... ... and not to your credit , nigel , as political officer .
what about the americans ?
they' ve got billions in surveillance .
they don' t know ?
perhaps they do know about it , but they' re not telling us .
you' re very quiet , francesca .
what are your feelings about andrew' s amazing discoveries ?
well , i couldn' t possibly comment .
no insight into the osnard methods , i' m afraid .
try not to look so furtive , harry .
i' m feeling a little anxious .
how do you think i feel ?
something wrong ?
yes .
we bombed in washington .
sit down .
the yanks say we' re talking through our asses .
no silent opposition .
no conspiracy to sell off the canal .
no fuck all .
they can' t say that .
they just said it .
the buchan material holds no credibility .
no credibility equals no cash .
without the yanks , london will pull the entire project .
why ?
because in matters of intelligence ... ... as in most other matters ... ... merry england sucks on the american hind tit .
it' s called , " the special relationship .
mickie will be very downcast , andy .
so will marta .
what about us ?
we both had a good thing going here .
i was counting on making a pension .
you thinking of retiring ?
scrap heap at 45 in this game .
it was blue chip material .
you said so yourself .
london needs something solid .
documents , evidence .
does your wife bring home papers , canal stuff ?
what' s that got to do with anything ?
does she ?
that' s all .
it happens .
take a look up its skirt .
come here .
come here .
give it back .
it' s a camera .
one picture' s worth a thousand words .
or a thousand bucks .
tell her that .
tell her ?
why not ?
put her on the payroll .
double your money .
i want something in writing on delgado' s dealings with the chinese .
no more bullshit .
louisa would never betray delgado .
she worships the man .
does she know where you' re at ?
not an inkling .
ever tell her about your prison days ?
not as such .
haul her in , harry ... ... or i might have to tell her about harry pendel , the criminal .
you stay away from her .
okay , i' il handle it .
you' re rather tense tonight , lou .
maybe because you' re peering over my shoulder again .
or maybe because i had a call from donna .
donna ?
teddy' s wife .
she said you were seen coming out of the hotel paraiso .
i said , " harry' s a tailor .
he has clients from all walks of life .
true .
you' d never meet them at the hotel paraiso .
i had a fitting with andy .
andy osnard .
he' s a bit eccentric .
are you seeing someone ?
me ?
you stay out late and you don' t say where .
you come at me like a lover and then you don' t touch me for weeks .
what' s going on , harry ?
who' s getting the rest of you ?
uncle benny , i' m cornered .
there' s nothing for it but to tell her the truth .
she deserves the truth .
a man who tells the truth is bound to be found out sooner or later .
try sincerity , that' s a virtue .
but truth , it' s an affliction .
i swear to you on my life ... ... there' s no other woman .
never has been .
never will be .
okay .
louisa ?
i' m a thief in my own home .
but with best intentions .
with a good heart .
for the family .
like you did forme .
that' s true .
you' re the apple ofmy eye , harry .
stay shtum , and i' il always be there foryou .
harry .
harry !
i couldn' t sleep .
what do you mean you couldn' t sleep ?
you were just out cold .
busy times at the shop , lou .
so who is this andy osnard ?
tell me about him .
he' s become a bit of a pal ... ... as such .
i used to be your pal ... ... " as such .
i' d like to meet him .
why don' t you invite him on sunday ?
that' s sarah' s birthday .
why not ?
i could look into it .
lf you don' t want to call him , i' il call him .
good .
and this season' s suits are very thin ... ... and it' s lined with panama' s best fabric .
buchan .
lady jane' s .
twenty minutes .
that' s two zero minutes .
over and out .
he' s been waiting and complaining .
sorry , teddy .
jacket' s ready .
just pop into the fitting room .
sorry , jaime , i need this .
ln you go , teddy .
wow !
even better than i thought .
you look like bobby de niro in this jacket .
don' t schmooze me , harry .
what' s going on ?
little bird tells me you paid off your overdraft .
business is good , teddy .
i smell a story .
there' s no story .
you want me to make one up ?
don' t .
louisa reads your gossip column .
i don' t want her to know i owed money .
come clean .
probably won' t run it .
i' m like that .
the more i know , the less i print .
you know i' il find out what you' re up to ... ... don' t you ?
well , i had absolutely no idea ... ... how delightful panama was gonna be .
yes , it' s beautiful country .
i was thinking about the people .
meant a lot to me , being able to tag along today .
it' s been a real pleasure to have you along , andy .
hasn' t it , darling ?
can we go and see the monkeys , dad ?
there' s a monkey island .
we bring bananas for them .
wonderful .
what' s my birthday girl say ?
can andy come too ?
no , andy needs to stay here and keep mommy company .
you go with dad .
ln you go .
cast off , captain .
so , andy ... ... maybe you wouldn' t mind telling me what you' re up to .
sorry ?
there' s something between you and my husband , i know it .
i can feel it .
ever since he' s met you , he' s a changed man .
sneaky and secretive .
all of a sudden , i' m his enemy and you' re his friend .
lf i didn' t know him better , i' d say you two were gay .
do you want it straight ?
always .
you' il keep it secret ?
lf i have to .
and he' s told you nothing ?
absolutely nothing ?
zero .
lnformation is my business .
gossip .
harry' s kind of gossip .
he' s smart , he' s down to earth .
he' s got great contacts and no agenda .
are you talking about spying ?
oh , that' s much too heavy a word for what harry' s doing .
are you paying him ?
no money , i' m afraid .
just the honor and privilege of service .
ls that why he' s been looking at all my private papers ?
oh , no .
harry .
oh , bless him .
that really is going too far .
spying on his own wife .
i' m terribly sorry .
still , you are the canal , aren' t you ?
you sit at ernie delgado' s right hand .
harry' s aware that we' re desperate to know what will become of it .
the canal is always gonna run the way it' s run .
ernie delgado will make sure of it .
that' s as may be ... ... but it' s our main artery .
you can' t blame us if we need constant reassurance .
harry' s only trying to help .
don' t ... ... use him .
i love him .
as we both do .
i' m going for a swim .
there' s one .
where ?
up there .
oh , yeah !
oh , he' s lovely !
so ....
tell me , how did harry win your heart ?
i was raised in the canal ... ... around military types and engineers like my father ... ... and i had never met anyone like harry .
he treated me like a princess .
sent me flowers every day .
wrote me love letters .
did he have to get arthur braithwaite' s permission ?
he called him in london .
he was on his deathbed , the poor man .
oh , god .
did he fly over for the funeral ?
arthur forbade it .
harry was completely wiped out .
i' m sure he was .
so the two of you have lived happily ever after ever since ?
yeah , until you came along .
don' t you ever feel like ... ... breaking out ?
running wild ... ... just for the badness ?
never .
harry is my virtue .
without him ... ... l' d be ....
you' d be ... ... like harry without arthur braithwaite .
well , she' s finally asleep .
i think she enjoyed her day .
yeah , i think so too .
and did you ?
yeah .
kind of .
what did you and andy find to talk about ?
you , mostly .
bit of a boring topic , wasn' t it ?
you' re a very surprising person , harry pendel .
after all these years ?
just don' t come between me and ernie delgado .
my work is off limits .
do you understand ?
okay , lou .
absolutely .
done .
harry .
what ?
make me laugh .
you' ve got a gift for it .
what ?
letting go .
few people can .
you can' t , or won' t .
no .
i' ve been reading your files .
oh , those fucking files .
we know too much about each other .
kills the romance .
what romance ?
oh , shit !
shit .
yes ?
yeah .
what ?
it' s a bit of a bad time , actually .
i didn' t know what she knew , did l ?
well , i' m sure you handled it like a master .
look hey , i had to think on my feet , didn' t l ?
all right .
all right , if you must .
rendezvous number three .
you know where that is , don' t you ?
oh , good .
twenty three hundred hours .
good .
what warrants dragging me out of the saddle on a sunday night , eh ?
look , about louisa .
some woman , harry .
i envy you .
the way she looks up to you .
you' re her moral virtue , her center .
just like arthur braithwaite was to you , is what she said .
i enjoyed the comparison .
you say anything ?
would i ever ?
expect me to tell her that an old jew brought me up ?
burned his frocks as a favor ?
hated the old fellow , did you ?
i know this place where we can talk .
i loved him .
i revere him .
dressed him up as arthur braithwaite .
gave him a good suit .
clothes maketh the man , " and all that .
come on , let' s dance .
camp it up a bit .
come on .
i' il lead .
so , i gather you' ve made no attempt to recruit her so far .
as of now , that is correct .
seemed perfectly approachable to me .
thought i' d have a go at her myself .
no , don' t do that .
ls this what you came to tell me ?
lay off her ?
i came to tell you i' ve had enough .
i want out .
i don' t think so .
you' ve taken the money , i want something for it .
those documents .
those ones that you snapped .
did you read them ?
i was pushed for time , andy .
pension scheme for lock keepers .
dredging contract .
water analysis .
zilch .
time to deliver .
i' m tired of your bullshit .
i can' t go on with it !
you want me to tell louisa ... ... about harry the convict ?
will you tell me what you want ?
come here .
keep moving .
stop acting so butch .
lf the canal' s being flogged off on presidential instructions ... ... what' s the price ?
who' s the buyer ?
when do they sign the contract ?
how much are delgado and the pres creaming off for themselves ?
right .
can' t hear you .
right .
then there' s your end of the bargain .
abraxas , the silent opposition .
are they going for direct action ?
direct action being in this case ?
shootibangs .
raising proletarian consciousness .
bombing banks , gunning down a couple millionaires .
no , not mickie , not marta .
so , what the fuck are they doing ?
who are they buying arms from ?
what are they gonna do with them ?
they' il have to do more than wear white shirts ... ... and get the shit beaten out of them by the dingbats !
come on .
i' ve got to get out .
i can' t think .
i can' t breathe .
go , harry .
go , go , go .
get me some answers .
your ass is on the line .
london' s coming .
get the stuff , we make you rich .
you don' t , we tell the pans you' ve been spying for the yanks .
you and louisa both .
do you understand what i' m saying ?
i haven' t come clean with you .
i' ve been dragging my feet .
at mickie' s behest , i might add .
he has a huge arms shipment on the way .
but he' il pay for it from another source .
oh , yeah ?
who the fuck would that be ?
won' t say .
no , he wouldn' t , would he ?
how much ?
it' s big money , andy .
harry , " he says to me , " your guys pay peanuts .
this is out of their league .
well ... ... this is an interesting development , harry .
give me a ballpark figure .
ten .
we' re talking ten million dollars , andy .
ten million dollars ?
yeah .
ten million dollars .
yeah .
andrew .
sir .
the winds of fortune blew me to caracas ... ... allowing me this brief stopover .
i' m on my way to washington .
our revered leader , henry cavendish , is coming too .
pick up the phone .
there' s prestige at stake , you see .
can you back it up ?
are we copper bottomed ?
yes .
how much are they asking for ?
fifteen million .
fifteen .
lf i get it for you , can you guarantee action ?
oh , absolutely .
go after them , andrew .
push .
the iron is hot .
strike !
sir , can i have your glass ?
we are ready for landing .
thank you .
oh , harry .
i hear that delgado ... ... is setting up a canal police force ... ... with powers to search the ships .
it' il never happen .
it would kill the drug trade , the arms trade ... ... everything we hold dear .
the way it is now , you pay your dues ... ... you don' t piss in the locks , they don' t fuck with you .
does louisa know anything about this little plan , harry ?
leave louisa out of this .
take it easy , harry .
time you took some holiday .
you look fucked out .
maybe if you paid your bill ...
... l might be able to .
maybe you' d be healthier ... ... if you stuck to tailoring .
listen , teddy  hey , harry .
it doesn' t look right .
this isn' t a suit , it' s a piece of shit .
come on , it' s the first fitting .
it can be fixed .
i don' t know .
think i' m gonna go to armani .
get myself a proper suit .
he doesn' t like it when i mention armani .
harry , why you make me this shit ?
why can' t you make a suit like armani ?
why can' t i make a suit like armani ?
you think armani can make a suit like harry pendel ?
why not ?
okay , fuck off .
go down the road , buy an armani !
save yourself $1 000 , see if i care !
at pendel and braithwaite you get savile row tailoring ... ... with 400 years of tradition behind it .
down the road you get an ltalian gents ' outfitter .
lf you don' t understand , then save your money .
hey , harry , come on .
the whole country' s going down the plug hole !
nobody cares !
someone' s got to stand up and be counted !
someone has to say , " here i am .
this is what i stand for !
lmpeccable standards and ... ... and old fashioned integrity !
and if you don' t like it , you can go down the road !
gentlemen , you go down that road ... ... you can never come back .
when you' ve gone down that road it' s over , it' s curtains .
and i' m not just talking about panama !
i' m talking about the whole human race .
you too .
get out .
harry , i was only kidding , i swear .
it' s just a sleeve .
i swear to god .
teddy came to see mickie .
he brought two goons with him .
said they were ministry of lnterior .
teddy ?
of course , he' s the worst .
they pay him , the ruling families .
he takes money to inform on his friends .
they were asking around about us .
they came to me too .
thinks we' re involved in a political thing against the system .
you know , like the old times .
you and marta ?
you and mickie .
why would they think that ?
maybe you know , harry .
i couldn' t do it again .
no more prison .
they break you in there .
you got so much courage in life .
when it' s gone , it' s spent .
i got none left .
i know what you mean .
i' ve been there , i know .
and they came to you ?
big chinese guy .
the man who beat her before .
what did they do to you ?
nothing .
they wanted information .
lf i didn' t give it to them , they' d make me look the same , both sides .
what information ?
about the two of you .
how often you meet , what you talk about .
i want you both to get out of town .
take a holiday .
there' s a fireworks festival in guarare .
you love fireworks .
the address is on the label .
pete abuleira lent it to me .
what are you going to do ?
sort it out .
talk to people i know .
better we go in separate cars .
i follow you later .
no more drinking now .
thanks , harry .
take care .
i never lied to you , marta .
you know that .
i didn' t tell you everything , but what i told you was true .
there' s only so many people you can do that to .
tell the truth .
other people are different .
they need to be ....
tailored .
helped .
yes .
you flatter them .
you make things up .
they start believing you , harry .
their leading man is one michelangelo abraxas .
known to many , i am sure , as the elusive pimpernel ... ... of the popularmovement against general manuel noriega .
abraxas is a man ofproven integrity ... ... skilled in clandestine warfare .
his second in command ... ... but i submit his equal in skill and resolution ... ... is code name " marta .
another veteran of the anti noriega resistance .
for cover purposes , she is employed as accountant receptionist ... ... by our own panamanian head agent ... ... the redoubtable buchan .
lf i may say so , elliot , a " silent opposition " ... ... doesn' t send radio messages .
half don' t possess telephones .
why else would they call themselves silent ?
they' re a life force , not an embassy .
fishermen ... ... small farmers , peasants , have nots , penniless students .
people we wouldn' t entertain in the woodshed .
so why should we support them , henry ?
because if we don' t , someone else will .
because the silent opposition is the new panama in the new millennium .
and getting in with these chaps ... ... is the sweetest , cheapest way of saving the canal .
do you think personally , this abraxas is ... ... presidential material ?
scotty .
abraxas is world class .
courageous ... ... unsullied , incorruptible .
a man to dream of when you' re shaping nations .
but abraxas can' t go it alone .
he needs our support now .
lf u. s. military assistance is guaranteed ... ... abraxas and his forces will launch an attack on the government .
they' il commandeer the radio stations and the canal administration office .
subject , of course , to advance payment ... ... for arms , equipment and medical supplies .
how much ?
the sort of money you boys leave under the plate , elliot .
how much ?
twenty million dollars .
elliot , may i say a couple of words , please ?
i' m only a rookie at heart .
i was the last american commander in panama .
i had the task of taking our men out of there .
only retreat of my career .
broke my heart .
there is a missing star on our flag , gentlemen .
looks to me that god has given us a second chance here .
yes ?
sir .
encrypted .
it went over like ninepins .
asked for 20 and guess what ?
they beat me down to 1 5 .
i' m on my way .
press play , andy .
teddy !
teddy !
why are you hassling mickie and marta ?
what are they up to this time , harry ?
what are you up to ?
spin me one of your stories .
you stay away from them or else .
how could you fuck that faceless half breed ?
no , no .
relax .
you' re a disgrace to that suit , teddy .
hey .
louisa .
there' s something i must tell you .
okay .
lou .
i need to talk to you .
okay .
hello ?
marta ?
yeah , it' s louisa .
i can' t hear you .
i' il get okay .
it' s for you .
it' s me .
oh , harry .
i need you .
please come .
it' s mickie .
he
marta ?
i' ve gotta go .
so it' s marta ?
all this time , under my nose .
no , you don' t understand .
oh , come on , harry .
please .
be a man .
well , if you love her , go .
yes , i do love her .
but i' ve never made love to her .
get out .
get out !
harry .
harry !
oh , shit !
washington has agreed that as we have the contacts ... ... that we should undertake the financing and arming ... ... of the silent opposition .
and it' s been agreed that that task be undertaken by an older hand .
by myself , in fact .
and on a more formal basis than hitherto .
i dare say that' il come as a bit of a relief to you , andrew .
equipping an army , tedious business .
not the sort of task for your mercurial brain .
best left to us humble planners and plodders , eh ?
it' s fine in principle , scotty .
just one snag .
they won' t talk to anyone but me .
i think you' il find that , however shy they are ... ... they' il talk to a candid friend ... ... who has $1 5 million to spend on them .
wouldn' t you say , ambassador ?
you know , for quite a while i was skeptical ... ... about this extraordinarily silent opposition .
and i always thought that mickie abraxas was just a harmless drunk .
funny how wrong you can be .
andy may have a real problem conjuring up one of these people for you .
afraid so , scotty .
lf you don' t go through me , there is no silent opposition .
it doesn' t do to be too possessive .
we must be brave and wean them off the osnard teat , my boy .
might i offer myself as a go between , so to speak ... ... to verify andy' s dispersal of these funds ?
kind of you to offer , ambassador .
perhaps so .
meanwhile , andrew can brief me on the details .
we have a lot to catch up on , eh ?
whiskey till the small hours in the privacy of your abode ... ... is indicated for osnard and luxmore , i believe .
sure .
excellent , gentlemen .
andrew , i take it you have a secure safe in your apartment ?
absolutely , sir .
fort knox .
ambassador .
i' il get my files .
you are getting out , aren' t you ?
possibly .
too early to say .
you' il have to , won' t you ?
i mean , there is no silent opposition , is there ?
who told you that ?
you did , just now in the meeting .
you made it all up , didn' t you ?
what are you talking about ?
i think you' re the wickedest human being i' ve ever met .
that was the attraction , wasn' t it ?
how about a farewell fuck ?
here in the office .
a knee trembler .
you know , i think i' m cured .
excuse me , francesca .
a private word with andrew .
he' s all yours .
my duty is to inform the foreign office of this ... ... travesty .
how much is your duty worth ?
two million .
one .
one and a half .
one and a quarter .
done .
andrew .
good night .
you got a lovely little family , harry .
only one thing can spoil it .
what' s that , uncle benny ?
the truth , harry .
that' s the honest truth .
esmeralda ?
esmeralda .
i' m going out .
watch the children .
marta !
marta !
oh , god !
i' m not imposing on you , am l ?
you' re not imposing on me in the least .
who the devil' s that ?
buchan 2 .
we got trouble .
when i get her into the other room , get out .
ln the lobby , give the concierge a dollar .
he' il get you a taxi to the el panama hotel .
get a room .
a taxi ?
at this time of night ?
i don' t speak spanish , andy .
i' m unarmed .
life is cheap here .
you can handle it .
you' re a field man , aren' t you ?
what about the bags ?
i' il guard them with my life .
believe me .
louisa .
something on your mind ?
what the fuck have you done ?
what is all this bullshit about abraxas and delgado ?
don' t worry .
it' s nothing .
it' s crap .
it' s all a game .
where' s harry ?
harry' s okay .
i' m gonna take care of harry and you .
get your fucking hands off me !
get off me .
relax .
we both know why you' re here .
yeah .
shit !
you ....
what have you gotten harry into ?
harry got himself into this with his own ludicrous stories .
when the americans take back their canal , it' il be down to him , not me .
when ?
when ?
get out of my way !
i killed him , marta .
i killed him with my bullshit .
he said the police were after him .
tell harry i' m sorry .
and i didn' t finish his suit .
it would' ve given him back his dignity .
he wouldn' t have shot himself in it .
he was always going to do it .
he was just looking for a good enough excuse .
shall i close his eyes ?
you must go now , harry .
go , harry .
yep .
harry , my man , where have you been ?
louisa was here .
i think she thought i was leading you astray or something .
jesus .
i see .
go on .
so we have to stop all this , you hear ?
mickie knew nothing about it .
you know and i know i made it all up .
it' s too late for that , old boy .
out of ourhands .
a case of life imitating art .
bit of a setback , sir .
it' s mickie abraxas .
bullet through the head .
suicide .
setback ?
setback ?
on the contrary .
no , they' il probably claim he killed himself in police custody .
that' s standard euphemism for assassinations in regimes of this ilk .
no , no one' s going to swallow that one .
no .
leader of the democratic rebel movement murdered .
yes .
i think we could have the peg we' re looking for , andy .
i' il inform ouramerican cousins .
now , tell me ... ... did you manage to resolve that buchan 2 situation ?
i got the distinct impression she was in a state ofhigh anxiety .
you must impress on your operatives the importance ofstaying in control .
andrew ?
hello , is anybody there ?
i must talk to the ambassador .
i' m english .
it' s a matter of grave importance .
mickie abraxas died three hours ago .
executed by a government death squad .
i have informed the president .
he has authorized us to go on in .
we have that right under the treaty if the canal is threatened .
operation straight arrow is all yours , general .
how soon can you be operational ?
give me four hours , sir .
that fast ?
my rapid response units are on full alert , sir .
carrier alaska is off the coast of panama .
eight f 22 raptors are on alert .
twelve gunships .
a battalion of marines .
i' ve got to speak to the ambassador .
the ambassador is busy .
you' il have to come back tomorrow .
ambassador .
i am buchan .
i made it all up .
you' ve got to stop it .
you see , i' m buchan .
i' m sorry , but aren' t you that tailor fellow ?
you' re rather upset .
nigel , please show the gentleman out .
yes .
there is no silent opposition !
someone' s gotta blow the whistle .
might as well be me .
you' re a diplomat .
be diplomatic .
can' t interfere at this stage .
it would reflect very badly .
and what could we say ?
that some deranged tailor johnny told us it was all a joke ?
nevertheless .
darling , what ?
i need to talk to ernesto .
andy .
andy !
wait !
oh , harry .
well , if the ambassador' s been recalled ... ... give me somebody who hasn' t been recalled .
his secretary , his butler , his
come with me , louisa .
we' re going to see the president .
shit !
oh , no , no , no .
come on , come on , come on .
what the fuck do you want ?
i want you to come back to the embassy and tell them it' s all a mistake !
harry , i' ve got our money here .
yours and mine .
i' m trying to get out before they close the airport .
i' m going straight to switzerland .
open numbered accounts for both of us .
you' il be a rich man .
just give me a lift .
we' re going back .

ambassador !
will you vouch for me , my credentials ?
i need to get on a plane .
you wish for this man to be included ?
i' ve never seen him before .
ambassador .
as you can see , the airport is closed , but palms have been greased .
and once our arrangement has been concluded ... ... you' il be free to go .
it is a fabrication , mr. president .
a pack of lies , a travesty .
the canal is safe , secure .
unthreatened .
call off your dogs , sir .
call them off .
i' il walk you to your plane .
could this be the beginning of a beautiful friendship ?
i think it desperately unlikely .
mission aborted .
return to base .
why ?
i don' t know .
i thought it was a game .
and behind my back ?
all those lies about the president and delgado ?
oh , yes , the lies .
i' m very , very sorry about the lies .
louisa ....
i never did work in savile row , did l ?
not as such .
i learned the tailoring in prison .
i burnt down my uncle benny' s warehouse to help him out .
and then , when i' d done my time ... ... uncle benny , he gives me my portion ... ... sends me out here so i can' t get into trouble .
i pretended he was arthur braithwaite .
you see , lying' s what you do in prison , lou .
it' s instead of love , really .
you tell it the way it should be since that' s better than how it is ... ... when it' s that bad .
lf you follow me .
why didn' t you just tell me from the start ?
because i fell in love with you , my princess .
and i knew that i wasn' t good enough for you .
not as i stood .
harry , you are such a fool .
dad , you promised to tell me a story .
where were you ?
oh , sarah .
i' m so sorry .
no need to cry about it , dad .
hi , dad .
hi , mum .
so , what do you want me to do ?
what do i want you to do ?
what you always do .
make breakfast .

yeah .
