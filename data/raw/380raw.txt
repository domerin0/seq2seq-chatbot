just as in the old days , huh ?
whenyousa ved our lives , sa ved our very sanity .
dmitri ... we have this little problem .
every search for a hero ... must begin with something that every hero requires a villain .
therefore , in thesearch forour hero , bellerophon , we created a monster , chimera .
i beg you , dmitri , come to sydney and accompany me to atlanta immediately .
ho wever we tra vel , lmust arrive at my destination ... within 20hours ofdeparture .
i fear i can entrust this to no one but you .
dmitri , as we say , i' m sorry andyou' re sorry .
do you have any idea what the hell he' s talking about ?
an idea ?
yeah .
like ?
like it ' s agoodidea topick him up in a hurry ... and a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier .
is he still in sydney ?
dr. vladimir nekhovich is dead .
so is his colleague gradski , but that happened earlier .
we had nekhovich on a flight from sydney that crashed in the rockies .
dead ?
are you listening to me ?
if he didn' t want to go anywhere without me , how did you get him on that flight ?
oh , you were there .
when lcouldn ' t findyou , lhadto replaceyou .
seanambrose was the obvious choice .
no w , he doubledyou , what , two orthree times ?
twice .
what did you think of him ?
we had our reservations about each other .
isn' t it a little late to be asking me that ?
no , not necessarily .
airline records ...
list a captain harold macintosh as the pilot offlight 2207 .
as fa r as the media and all government agencies are concerned ,
captain macintosh died on the flight .
but , in fact , he missed it .
he did , however , make the next flight ... in cargo .
stuffed into a rather small suitcase , considering his size .
now , someone on that flight planned an operation ... designed to bring theplane do wn andmake it looklike an accident .
someone skillfu i enough to bring the whole thing off without a hitch .
so there' s one thing we know that ambrose doesn' t .
you do think it was ambrose ?
you' re not surprised ?
sean feels he hasn' t done thejob unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground .
the question is why ?
what was this , uh , chimera , nekhovich was carrying ?
only ambrose knows that .
in any case , you must recover this whatever chimera , and bring it to us .
in order to do that , i have to fii gure out how he plans to make money with it .
that is where miss hall comes in .
excuse me ?
miss hall and ambrose had a relationship ... which he took very seriously .
she walked away , and he' s been wanting her back ever since .
we believe she' s our surest and quickest way of locating him .
and then what ?
well , make sure she continues to see him , gets him to confii de in her , and report to you .
you made it sound as if i was recruiting her for her skills as a thief .
well , then i misled you , oryou made the wrong assumption .
either way , we' re asking her to resume a prior relationship , not do anything she hasn' t already done .
voluntarily , lmight add .
no , she' s got no training for this kind ofthing .
what , to go to bed with a man and lie to him ?
she' s a woman .
she' s got all the training she needs .
i don' t think i can get her to do it .
you mean it' il be diffii cult .
very .
well , this is not mission diffii cult , mr. hunt , it' s mission impossible .
diffii cult should be a walk in the park foryou .
i' m open to suggestion .
lfyou can think ofa quicker way , you' re welcome to try .
you might take a lookat these ... ifyou have any further qualms aboutgetting her to do thejob .
****** [ woman vocalizing ]
how many people are capable ofsomething like that ?
sean ambrose , for one .
right .
this wasn' t what i had in mind , nyah .
but it is what you' d like me to do .
what ?
oh , let my conscience be my guide , is that it ?
something like that .
i don' t have a conscience .
i' m a bloody thief .
are you gonna try and force me to do this ?
generally , i don' t favor coercing someone , not when there' s a chance my life could end up in their hands .
is that the only reason ?
can you think ofa better one ?
me ?
no .
but i wasjust hoping that you might , thinking that somewhere , this got personal as well as physical !
would it make you feel any better if i didn' t want you to do this ?
yeah , much .
then feel better !
you know , sean will never be anything butsuspicious ... iflpitch up saying , " hey , honey , i' m home .
what wouldn' t make him suspicious ?
that i needed him in some urgent way .
destitute .
in serious trouble .
the kind i couldn' t possibly sort out myself .
serious trouble , nyah , is something that i can always arrange .
this transponder chip is completely untraceable .
it transmitsyour location to a satellite ... which can be read by only this computer .
we can then trackyou to within three feet .

every search fora hero ... must begin with something that every hero requires a villain .
therefore , in the search for our hero , bellerophon , we created a monster , chimera .
nekhorvich was a molecularbiologist .
why is he going on about an old greek myth ?
nekhorvich specialized in recombining dna molecules .
in the myth ,
bellerophon was aprince who killed the chimera .
a monster with the headofa lion ... andthe tail ofa serpent ... whoplagued the ancient world .
i think nekhorvich created a monster virus named chimera ... andthe antivirus to kill it , named bellerophon .
that simple , huh ?
why not ?
$$37 million .
now , that' s a promising bid for nekhorvich' s work .
don' t look so worried , hugh .
we' re halfway there .
we' il need this at the track ... ifwe' re gonna get the other half .
well , then ... sorted .
not everything .
why do you think she' s really here ?

you' re dead .
dead , certainly .
but dead is a little extreme .
on the other hand , when my colleague gradski had your pulse ... and your blood pressure , he had less than a day to live .
you are infected with chimera , my friend .
no use , my friend .
the medicalstaff wants nopart ofthis .
doctors don' t fa ncy the idea ofdying any more than anybody else .
how could i possibly be infected ?
that' s exactly what gradski said 27 hours before he died .
you' ve got the antidote , you miserable bastard !
you stole bellerophon !
all of it !
my , my , my .
lneed it ! lneed it now , you whacked out russian gypsy !
and what about gradski , who you deliberately infected with chimera ?
how was i to know they needed ... to be treated with bellerophon within 20 hours ?
by asking me .
youstill don' t get it , doyou ?
i needed to knowjust how bad the disease was in the real world , notjust the lab .
you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza ... to create a cure forall influenzas .
butyou were also creating a disease so terrible in chimera , the cure would be priceless .
lneeded chimera in order topeddle bellerophon .
it' s not that diffii cult to understand , is it ?
look , i' ve got the virus .
you' ve got the cure .
lneed them both .
time was a shot of penicillin would knock off ... every bloody bug in the zoo .
not anymore .
lfl couldn ' t make money killing the microscopic little shits out there , well , you' d help me put one out there that i could make money on .
well , there it is .
i' ve confessed .
i, john c. mccloy , am in business to make money .
no w , forget any dealyou may have made with that thugambrose .
get me treated , and let' s go back to work .
you know ,
i think it' s a little late for that .
dogive my regards to gradski ... ifyou see him .
well ...
i' ve heard ...
all i need to hear .
nyah ... it' s imperative that we do nothing to alarm ambrose .
what ?
you told me to get out ofthere as soon as possible .
i thought you were here to collect me !
shh , shh , shh , shh , shh !
listen to me .
there' s no time to talk .
it is critical , absolutely critical , that you do whatever ambrose asks .
do you understand me ?
don' t worry .
it will all be over ... very soon .
that' s a promise .
go on .
go on .
off you go .
luther , we know this much .
nekhorvich gets on a plane ... to go to the center for disease control in atlanta .
he' s carrying a virus he created , chimera , and the cure for that virus , bellerophon .
ambrose doesn' t have the virus .
that' s why ambrose needs mccloy .
so we go into biocyte , kill chimera ,
ambrose has a cure without a disease , and we' re home free .
you were right .
huntstung mccloy tonight .
so he knows .
he' il be going into biocyte .
good .
then we' il know where he' il be , don' t we ?

okay , take a look at this .
start from the inside out .
all storage and production of chimera is done here , in this lab on the 42ndfloor .
hunt' s target will be the chimera , stored and manufactured at biocyte on the 42nd floor .
ifyou look at hunt' s operational history , and i have , he invariably favors misdirection over confrontation .
he ' il never breakinto biocyte from the bottom where security is hea viest .
no garage entrances .
lobby' s protected by fiive guards on rotating patrol .

show me the atrium .
the atrium ?

andifthe louvers are up for more than 40 seconds at night , the civil emergency alarms are tripped .
those , even lcan' t stop .
ethan , we have a total of40 seconds ... to get you in and the cables out .
no , hunt willprefer to enter biocytesomewhere from the top ... where security is minimal .
he' il undoubtedly engage in some aerobatic insanity ... before he' il risk harming a hair on a security guard' s head .

ethan , thegenerator' s about togo active .
just a friendly reminder .

hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one .
ho wever we tra vel ,
lmust arrive at my destination within 20hours ofdeparture .
ho w was lto know that he needed to be treated ... with bellerophon within 20hours ?
get him .
how much longer before you can reach him ?
we ' ve got29 seconds before thegenerators turn off , then ethan will be back on line .
ahh !
luther !
luther !
holdyour fire !
hold your fii re , damn it !
well , hunt ... how' ve you been ?
fighting a bit ofa cold .
aww .
you know , that was the hardest part of having to portray you grinning like an idiot every 1 5 minutes .
i would' ve thought the hardest part was curbing that pressing need ofyours ... to get your gun off .
you were in such a hurry to knock off that 747 ... you never fii gured out where chimera really was .
i knew where it was .
oh .
then you knew the only way nekhorvich could smuggle the live virus ... is by injecting himselfandusing his own bloodstream as apetri dish .
you knew that ... while you were knocking him off , destroying the very thing you came for .
stop !
put a sock in it !
hit that bloody gun , and you' il spray the virus all over the place !
there it is , guys .
the last of it .
what was the top bid ?
why ?
you gonna make me a better offer ?
than $$37 million ?
not really .
oh !
somebody has been slipping you our mail .
come on out here , you badgirl .
sean , she doesn ' t belong here .
let hergo .
she wouldn' t be here ... if it wasn' t foryou , hunt .
from this moment , you are responsible for what happens to her .
and ifyou' re looking out for her well being ,
lsuggestyou advise her topick up the injectiongun andbring it to me .
ball' s in your court , hunt .
nyah' s in the building .
do you copy ?
thankyou .
how do you know he won' t shoot you the minute he' s got it ?
please .
one can' t hold nyah responsible for her actions .
you know women , mate .
like monkeys they are .
won' t let go ofone branch till they get a grip on the next !
get it , nyah .
i' il coveryou .
i am waiting .
things haven' t exactly worked out the way you thought they would , ethan .
sorry .
you bitch !
****** [ lndistinctsinging ]
you' re not gonna shoot me , sean .
not this bitch .
' cause she' s worth $$37 million .
what did you thinkyou were doing ?
i wasn' t thinking !
just trying to stop you from getting hurt , that' s all !
you who don' t have a conscience .
i guess i lied .
you can' t get us both out of here , can you ?
i' m infected with chimera .
you know you don' t have a choice .
just do it .
do it now !
we' ve got 1 9 hours and 58 minutes !
i' il get bellerophon into your system before then !
just stay alive !
i' m not going to lose you !
feel like pleading foryour life ?
well , then , how about dying ... so you can make me a lot of money ?
in just a few hours time , you can be assured ... of going down in history as the typhoid mary of oz .
g' day .
there ' s not a chance oflocating nyah until lcan access thesatellite .
and there' s not a chance ofdoing that until i can get this computer fiixed .
how much time does she have left ?
not long .
but whatever happens , nyah will take care of nyah .
what do you mean ?
unless we dose her with bellerophon ,
nyah will kill herself .
so fii rst things fii rst .
ethan , ambrose and his team have arrived ... over the bridge , andnyah' s not with him , mate .
copy that .
you all right , mate ? looks like pretty hea vy security from here .
what' s it looklike from there ?
risky .
simon ?
simon !
stay here .
breached the structure at the 1 0 : 00 grating .
it' s a dna match .
the blood' s loaded with chimera .
and they certainly have bellerophon .
well , then you' ve got both the virus and the antivirus , which means i' ve got 30million foryou .
not exactly .
we don' t wantjust your cash .
what do you want ?
stock , mr. mccloy .
stock options , to be a little more precise .
cut her loose ... right in the center oftown .
the more crowded the better .
ethan , just picked up an ambrose call .
nyah' s been dropped off .
where is she ?
somewhere in sydney .
somewhere in sydney ?
care to harden the target ?
i can' t until ...
i can get the gps up on our computer .
it' s down .
the clock is ticking .
how quickly can you manufacture more ofthe antivirus ?
no time at all , once i' ve got it .
good .
biocyte stock isjust a few weeks away from going through the roof .
what are you talking about ?
an outbreak of chimera .
where ?
downtown sydney , for a start .
you create the supply , mr. mccloy .
we' vejust created the demand .
three million people in sydney ... and 1 7 million people in australia ... are going to need bellerophon within the next few days , not to mention the rest ofthe world .
now , this is how it' s going to work .
wallis , theshares outstanding are ?
93 . 4 million .
which means , mr. mccloy , we need to get our hands on 480, 000 options .
we' il borrow your 30 million to buy those options .
yourstock has neversold above $3 1 a share .
when your stock goes north of 200 , which it will , those options will be worth billions , andl will own 51 % ofbiocyte .
this is outrageous .
i will not let you take control of my company .
sit down .
you' il be a billionaire .
it ' s better than being broke .
i have terrorists and ... other pharmaceutical companies standing in line .
the ball' s in your court , mr. mccloy .
run that bastard down .
we' re running short on time , mr. mccloy .
we have got to conclude our business .
yes .
start the transfer .
follow it ... and let me know .
uh !
raise your hands very slowly .
sure you want me to do this ?
raiseyour hands very slo wly .
ethan , ethan , do you copy ?
do you copy ?
keep it going !
sean , this rat' s reached the endofthe maze .
is he alive ?
yeah , more orless .
bring him to me .
go !
sean , transfer completed .
well done , stamp .
well done .
stop mumbling !
i' m afraid he' s got no choice .
lbelieve lbroke hisja w .
stamp , i' m impressed .
right .
we don' t have a lot oftime , hunt .
whateveryougot to say , say it now .
how about giving us a big smile ?
no ?
what are you doing ?
get down on your knees .
now , this is what' s known ... as getting your gun off .
****** [ choirsinging requiem ]
there he is !
ethan !
just back off and pinpoint your positions !
luther , clear the bridge for me !
hunt' s heading for the bridge , coming in at 1 2 : 00 high .
oh , i' m mad now .
ha ha !
you all right , mate ?
that punk put a hole in my versace !
ethan , the computer' s up .
i' ve got nyah .

but i can' t get a visual .

she' s only got a little time left !
track ahead and pick her up !
i can' t get a good shot .
ethan , we won' t be able to coveryou !

billy , north head bluff .
haul ass .

ahhh !

it ' s not a bad way togo .
it' s a lot better than the way that bitch is gonna die .
****** [ lndistinctsinging ]
hey , there she is !
****** [ woman vocalizing ]
hunt !
youshould' ve killed me .
miss hall' s blood , it appears , has absolutely no elements ofthe chimera virus , not even antibodies .
yes .
i gathered as much .
but you were under specifii c instructions , mr. hunt , to bring back a living sample ofthe chimera virus .
i' d be very interested to know how , afteryou managed this recovery , it subsequently got destroyed .
by fii re .
it' s the best way , really .
oh .
well , mr. hunt , as for miss hall , in light of her efforts , her criminal record will certainly be expunged .
wiped out .
i' m assuming you approve .
i do .
yeah .
where is she now , by the way ?
any idea ?
i don' t know .
not exactly .
so , what areyourplans ?
uh , somesort ofvacation .
i' il letyou know where i' m going .
