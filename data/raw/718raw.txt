all right , what the hell .
this must' ve been , like , 15 years ago , you know ?
we had a kid working at the club named phil coletti .
and one night it was a night a lot like tonight this gorgeous woman comes into the club , asks him if he wants to go out to the jungle .
he' s like , " yeah .
why not ? '
so they split .
and as they started getting out to the jungle ... further and further away from the lights of the club ... she starts asking him these questions , like ... does he believe in the local legends of the island ... voodoo , zombies .
he' s not too worried about it .
he just rolls right over , starts putting the screws to her .
but something doesn' t feel right to coletti .
but he can' t see shit .
it' s pitch black , so he just keeps bangin ' away .
but then , boom !
a flash of lightning lights up the whole island , and in that one moment ...
coletti looks around and sees not only is he out in the middle of that old mayan cemetery ... not only are all the other guys from the resort standing around watching him ... but he sees that he' s having sex with a corpse .
a cold , white ...
dirty from the grave dead body .
and they say ...
phil coletti calmly walked to the groundskeeper' s shack ... found a machete ... and chopped those staff members into a hundred pieces .
and they say he took that same machete ... chopped his own dick off and ran screaming into the jungle .
nobody ever saw him after that .
but from that point on ...
phil coletti was forever known ... as machete phil .
are you telling me there' s some totally deranged , dickless dude running around out there ?
all i ' m saying is i don' t go into the jungle alone if i can help it .
' cause you can hear him , and i' ve heard him ... crying out ...
where' s my penis ?
where' s my penis ?
where' s my penis ?? '
and that boy was me !
you' re an asshole , putman .

that' s great !
i only heard it for a second , but  so what do we do ?
if it is one of ours , this guy' s got it .
it' s probably not a real good idea ... to go lookin ' for it unless you want to get your dingy chopped off .
what ?
hey , i figured it out .
i know where those lines on the board came from .
you know that line , " everyone' s looking to find their own paradise " ?
that' s from one of your songs .
what the fuck you talkin ' about ?
one of my songs ?
yeah , it' s off your album " sea shanties and wet panties . '
1978 ?
let' s see those pinchers , people !
what does this song have to do with all this ?
the name of the song is " naughty cal .
naughty cliff .
naughty carlos .
naughty cal !
shit .
that' s the line that was on the board yesterday .
i didn' t know where it was from .
how do you not know the words to your own song ?
i don' t even remember making the album , okay ?
shit , it was ' 78 .
we were all out of our gourds .
it was kind of a crazy time in 1978 .
oh , man , we had some fuckin ' parties .
" high as a kite " ?
he fell and cracked his shell " ?
that' s like carlos up in the parasail .
then " lost in a maze , " exactly like cliff .
so this guy is killing people according to a fucking acid trip song ?
this is insane !
peter .
what' s the song about ?
i s there some sort of special significance ?
fuck no .
i mean , uh , i don' t know .
it' s a sea shanty .
naughty cal' s this , uh , underwater cowboy ... and tokey and bongo are his buddies .
and they go on this adventure to find , uh , atlantis or some shit .
i i i  let' s listen to the next line and see what happens .
maybe if i play it backwards .
wait , listen .
listen .
so , what the hell ?
the orca and the octopus ?
i mean , is it the next victims , or is it the killer ?
our lives depend on us interpreting the dumbest fucking song i' ve ever heard .
please , don' t hold back .
just say what you really think .
i' m not sensitive .
you know , i won about five fucking gold records in my lifetime .
h how many gold records do you have ?
let' s see how it ends .
jesus .
pete !
yu and hank are dead .
why ?
what did we do ?
no , man .
yu and hank are fucking dead .
you threatening me ?
' cause if you are , you little hairless lap dog ! ay , puta !
just come and look !
don' t let this be yu . '
she was just trying to warn the guests .
hank !
yu ?
why are we doing a goddamn fashion show ?
because it' s goddamn fashion show wednesday , that' s why !
look what happened to yu !
do your jobs or die " ?
so we' re just gonna put little smiles on our faces ... and march out there and do our goddamn jobs .
you got that ?
lars , you' re up .
come on .
let' s go .
you got it , pete .
lars brunckhorst , everybody .
lars is sporting the pleasure poncho .
only 19 . 95 at the gift shop .
thank you , lars .
i' m tellin' ya , i got a bad feeling about that new guy .
you are right .
it all started when he got here , didn' t it ?
sam , it isn' t lars or any of us .
look , jenny .
i know why you re defending him .
pajamas !
come on !
move !
putman , pillow .
putman livingston , i presume .
oh , if it isn' t little lord fauntleroy !
pip , pip !
tallyho !
i got it .
in that song ...
naughty cal sings about the scary octopus .
look at putman !
putman is the octopus .
hello ?
dave , just go play with the curtains or something .
no , no , no .
we can' t dismiss that song .
what about carlos and cliff ?
what about the fact that hank was buried in the sand like the buried treasure in the song ?
all right , so maybe the octopus ... is the way the next person dies ?
how do you kill someone with an octopus ?
octopus spelled backward is " supotco .
juan , isn' t that spanish for something ?
supotco " ?
no .
the word for shoe is zapato .
hmm .
shoe .
am i the only one who thinks his head looks like an octopus ?
shh , shh , shh .
here he comes .
what did i miss ?
apparently , somebody' s gonna get killed by a shoe .
hmm .
okay , you guys , instead of focusing on the song , why don' t we go look for those boats ?
good idea .
jenny , why don' t you and i go search together ?
um  putman .
why don' t you and i go and look for that boat ?
are you daft ?
i' m not going out in the jungle with you and your bloody shiatsu .
if you re the killer , you' il snap my neck like a twig .
all right , stick to the shore .
there' s no reason to go in the jungle .
the boats are probably gonna be covered with sticks .
or branches .
thanks much , officer .
aren' t you taking any weapons ?
i have all the weapons i need .
piss on that .
i' m taking a machete .
thanks for doing this , lars .
you' re very brave .
just be careful , all right ?
good luck , putman .
better believe i' il be keeping an eye on you , mr. miyagi .
i know you guys are probably a little intimidated by cooking for the whole resort ... but i think you re gonna get a big kick out of it , okay ?
i bet you watched yu and kelly .
and most of it' s just common sense .
like right now ...
i' m making my famous coconut pete' s paella .
can anyone guess the secret ingredient ?
come on .
coconut pete' s paella ?
the secret ingredient ?
coconut ...
pete' s  eh
coconut ?
yes , goddamn it !
yes !
yes !
jesus !
you think eddie money has to put up with this shit ?
goddamn it !
coconut pete' s paella !
jesus christ .
what you think ?
i think pete' s under a lot of pressure .
i don' t think we can say for sure .
god , i don' t know .
what are you doing ?
uh , you know .
just , uh , hanging around , uh , looking through the window .
calamari ?
uh  it' s an aphrodisiac , juan .
oh .
oh !
what' s wrong ?
you' re not afraid of a little octopus , are you ?
thank you .
when you' re done here ...
i want you to come inside and find me ...
' cause i wanna wrap my little tentacles around you .
okay .
no way .
think about it , the octopus .
look , she' s a weird little chick , i' il give you that .
but , look , it still doesn' t prove that she' s the killer .
all right .
there is only one way to find out .
don' t be nervous .
eh , i just want our first time to be wonderful .
so i would say that if you re the killer ... just , you know , just maybe don' t kill me .
or at least make it , you know , painless .
with those moves of yours , i bet you could put me down nice and easy .
just , zip , and i' m out , right ?
look .
the whole reason we' re hiding in this closet is because we think she' s the killer .
oh .
i' m gonna bite you .
well , not too hard , i hope .
i really like juan .
i remember when we first met , i was kinda like , " who the fuck is this guy ?
some local guy comin ' down here and
mmm .
i haven' t been entirely honest with you .
you mean ... you don' t really go to the oral roberts ?
aah !
i mean ...
i just wanted to leave my past behind me when i came here .
what the fuck are you , a praying mantis woman ?
i
i' ve never been to a place like this .
i mean , it' s just so free .
juan , i have spent my whole life in a gym .
i just wanted to party like everyone else .
my coach , orgrav , would kill me if he found out .
he would hunt me down like a deranged lunatic .
he' s really scary some  wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
you are a gymnast ?
yeah .
oh !
gracias .
no tushie !
no !
no !
i ' i i be right back .
okay .
eh , i ' m still not sure .
i may need a few more hours to pump her for information .
you asshole !
now you' re just trying to get laid .
how would you like to be stuffed in this closet while i go out there and have sex ?
that is a great idea .
shh !
here she comes !
what exactly are your intentions with jenny ?
you know , put ... during the sung dynasty , there was a great mystic master tsu tong po .
if you love something , set it free .
if it comes back to you " fuck off .
it' s a bloody hallmark card .
just trying to help you , man .
well , she has taken quite a fancy to you , hasn' t she ?
but i have some ... ammunition of my own .
what kind of man would i be if sat idly by while you stole her from me ?
do not underestimate me , lars .
i know things you don' t .
all right , lars , let' s see what you got .
look what i found .
wow .
yeah .
shiny .
hey .
oh !
i knew it .
oh , sick fuck .
dear god in heaven .
lars ?

whoo !
hang on to your kudos .
oh !
she' s not going anywhere .
what did you do to the propeller , man ?
i didn' t do anything .
this is the one that was pulling carlos .
well , we could send a group to paddle out to the mainland .
we' ve got plenty of strong guys .
no chance .
the riptide' il take you out to sea .
you' il be drinking your own urine in less than 20 hours .
where' s putman ?
he' s not here ?
he left last night .
he ran off into the jungle .
oh , by " ran off ' do you mean " got killed by you " ?
ah !
what , did you really think we wouldn' t notice putman was gone if you came back with a boat ?
sam , that' s ridiculous .
why is that ridiculous ?
hey , look .
putman freaked out in the middle of the night and took off into the jungle .
look , we went into your room last night , lars .
mark david chapman over here has a shrine to pete .
it' s unbelievable !
so i' m a fan .
a fan ?
man , you' re a fucking loon !
look , nobody here was killed last night ... because lars was in the jungle killing putman .
hey , look .
i could never hurt another person , okay ?
i don' t believe in violence .
mm hmm .
i touch other people to make them feel better .
come on .
i have an obligation to get to the bottom of that
come on .
i have an obligation to get to the bottom of that
! ay !
you are the fucking fun police !
juan !
what the hell  come on , take it easy !
quit your bickering !
now , we just get through one more night , the boat will be here tomorrow .
we il be all right .
so , come on , everybody , let s just have a drink ...
and ... mellow out .
i don' t want to mellow out , pete !
i want to know what lars' s deal is , huh ?
you come here and everyone starts getting killed .
hey , i don' t have to tell you shit , fun pig !
you wanna fun arrest me ?
you get a fun fucking warrant !
until then ... stay out of my fun fucking face !
come on !
jenny , you know i' m not the killer , right ?
look , lars , it' s not so bad in here , okay ?
i' il bring you some magazine .
yeah .
you familiar with the expression " sitting duck " ?
no .
you guys , this is totally fucked up .
look , jenny ... if he s the killer , then we have him in this room .
and if not , then at least we know it' s not him .
did it stink ?
you bet it stunk .
oh , shit !
hey , you guys gonna be hanging around for a while ?
totally .
we' re just getting started .
anyway , that' s my mom for you .
any of you guys have a mother ?
free drinks , whoever catches me !
whoo hoo !
shit .
oh , god !
your prayers have been answered .
you asshole !
nah , i' m not an asshole .
i' m just young , dumb and full what the fuck ?
what ?
something just brushed against my leg .
what the
no , there' s seriously something down here .
what ?
oh , no , wait !
it' s just my gigantic cock .
amy' s got some fantastic advice for everybody .
oh , my god .
so , you want to get it on ?
dirk , get outta the pool !
huh ?
i' m not kidding !
hurry !
hey , that' s what i call service !
now !
get outta the pool !
hey , help me !
putman !
you' re alive !
you' ve got your arms around me , jenny .
i can only assume this means every other man on the island is dead .
we got to get outta here !
dirk' s dead !
he just got electrocuted in the pool !
really ?
what was the look on his face ?
he must have screamed bloody murder .
you' re scaring me .
i just want to know if smoke came out of his ears .
is that so wrong ?
hey !
oh !
putman , where have you been ?
running in circles through this bloody jungle , that' s where .
thank god you' re not dead .
now , we need to get over to pete' s cabana ...
and get that auxiliary generator .
wait , hang on !
if dirk just got killed , then lars couldn' t be the killer !
all right now , be on guard .
he might be a little cranky .
lars !
lars , we' re here !
oh , do give it a rest , jen .
he couldn' t have .
he' s far too large .
we gotta find pete .
pete !
pete ?
pete ?
you in here , pete ?
peter !
we need the key to the generator box .
damn it !
isn' t somebody going to get the fuckin ' door ?
who' s there ?
who' s out there ?
hey !
i think there' s a problem with the lights !
right ?
all right , lars will probably come after us here .
we don' t know for sure that it is lars .
and we don' t know if he got out or if someone else got in .
what is it with you and lars ?
i' m beginning to wonder if you aren' t in cahoots !
i mean , let' s see .
you had sex with rolo , and he' s dead .
you and cliff , right ?
he' s dead .
give me a break .
i screwed juan and pete , and those guys aren' t dead .
bloody hell , jen !
am i the only one ?
all right , let' s get back to the case .
what we have to do
why don t you drop the bullshit cop routine , okay , sam ?
oh , just as soon as you drop the " i' ve got nothing to hide " routine , juan .
let me guess .
you were in here looking for this letter from the encarnacion prison facility ?
what the fuck , man ?
fuck , why you are doing this , man ?
juan shows no signs of the bizarre and horrible behavior ...
that brought him to this institution .
we believe him to be fully rehabilitated ... and will be an excellent addition to your staff .
what did you do , juan ?
i did nothing , jenny .
what the fuck did you do , man ?
costa rican prison that' s some hard core anal action , man .
juan , we have to know .
what did you do , juan ?
what did you do , juan ?
what the fuck did you do , man , huh ?
what did you do ?
tell us !
i did nothing !
huh ?
el chupacabra !
hey !
no !
oh !
oh , my god !
how could you do that ?
wait , wait !
i did not do this .
i ' m not a killer .
i did not do this .
i' m not a killer .
what the fuck , man ?
then , what is this ?
you want to know what i did ?
huh ?
you all want to know what i did ?
juan castillo ... went to jail ... for having sex with a goat .
all right ?
what you want me to say ?
we lived on a farm !
and i got lonely !
we were
oh , we were just a couple of stupid kids .
no , it wasn t juan .
it was dave ... wasn' t it ?
you hated him for what he did to your parents .
you see , what none of us did know ... indeed , what none of us could know ... was that david' s parents ... were trampled to death at a coconut pete concert .
what the hell' s wrong with you , putman ?
everyone knows dave' s parents got killed at a pete show .
yeah , way to bring up a sore subject .
what ?
i what ?
you think i could have killed him ?
he' s my uncle petey .
you all saw him as ... a mellow island songster ... and a resort owner , but ... how many of you knew that he he was afraid of dogs ... and that his favorite spice was rosemary ?
how many of you knew that ... he was uncircumcised and smelled of oranges ?
yes , that' s all well and good , david .
but i' il bet hind to horses ... that you inherit the island .
the island is already mine .
what ?
pete signed it over to me last week .
he was going back on the on the road where he belonged .
he was forming a super group billy squier and eddie money !
don henley was gonna play drums !
fuck , that would' ve been tight !
fuck .
he was gonna sell the island to the navy for test bombing .
but i told him i i could handle the responsibility .
lars .
no !
no !
pete .
oh , my god !
pete !
bravo , lars , bravo .
very convincing .
very convincing .

lars !

let' s lock him up again .
no !
no !
stop it !

we' re not locking anybody up !
we' re all gonna stay together , in one room !
look , the boat will be here tomorrow .
we' il go to the club , gather all the guests ... and wait until the morning , and we' re going to do this together .
and we' re gonna make it through the night , okay ?
screw this , man !
i' m not going anywhere with lars .
well , i' m not going anywhere with juan .
ooh !
what kind of a man has sex with a goat ?
hey , i used a condom .
oh .
you told me they were against your religion .
ehhh , you know , i need to find peenalop .
i am sure you all understand .
you come anywhere near my cabana , i' m taking your head off ! .
let' s get outta here , dave .
come on , dave , let' s get outta here , man .
i don' t think so .
jenny , you' re making a most grievous mistake .
i' m still not sure what happened ... with all that dodgy business back in the jungle .
but i' m plagued by the dreams .
i believe i' m safer on my own .
well , that plan went to hell .
well , at least they left us a torch .
jenny ?
jenny ?
i believe i know where the generator is .
damn it !
he must have taken my swords .
i don' t care if have to carve a spear out of bamboo , this asshole' s

he' s the guy from the campfire story machete phil , the kid with no dick .

that' s just an old campfire story .
what do you piss out of , your asshole ?
it' s just a story !
i have a dick .
i' m not machete phil .
i' m machete sam .
sam , why are you doing this ?
oh , i remember it like it was yesterday .
i asked rolo if he had any grass , and he said he didn' t have any .
so then i followed him into the jungle .
would you believe what i saw ?
no .
he had grass .
my grass !
a huge bag of it .
and he was smokin ' it with those two little hussies ... even though he said he had none .
so then no , wait , that' s not it .
i found out that pete was giving the island to dave .
oh , yeah .
that' s it .
it wasn' t about the grass .
although that was incredibly uncool .
it was about pete giving the island to that little shithead !
all night raving , pill popping little son of a bitch !
what about me ?
h uh ?
i deserved it !
i ' m the best goddamned employee this place has ever seen !
dave was gonna run it into the ground .
not on my watch !
this is my home .
pete thinks i m just a clown , good for fun and games .
well , i got you guys to do your jobs , didn' t i ?
