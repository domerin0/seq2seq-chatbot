did you blow the candles out downstairs ?
yeah .
look at this .
a thanksgiving cornucopia made of pie plates and spackle .
what the heck is a cornucopia ?
it' s like a horn of plenty .
oh , dear , can' t it wait ?
we just finished decorating for halloween .
well , good night .
good night .
go look !
just a prank , that' s all .
anton .
our little scooter would never do something like that .
quit calling him that baby name .
anton would not scoot his behind off the couch if the house was on fire .
god knows he didn' t help me with the halloween decorations .
did you hear that ?
i heard something downstairs .
well , the dog' s out in the yard .
it' s probably just the cat .
well , go see !
hey , bones .
gary ?
anton ?
gary , you said you
the house could burn down !
wake up !
anton , is that you ?
if you' d like to make a call , hang up and try again .
if you need help , hang up and then dial your operator .
hey , mom !
we' re out of milk !
mom , we' re out of dog food !
a special report .
four bodies were found .
and the killer is still at large .
bolan is gripped with fear ... ... as killings spread from a postal route ... ... to the bowling alley and now to our own burger jungle .
with halloween only one day away ... ... bolan officials have set a 9 p . m . curfew for all teenagers .
hey , what' s up , man ?
what' s up with you ?
i' m dry .
so ?
so why don' t you bring me a dimer ?
this ain' t domino' s , you lazy bitch .
come over and get it .
come on , man .
i' m comfortable .
hello ?
what' s up , anton ?
nice outfit !
yeah ? lf your mom had teeth , she wouldn' t suck dick so well .
what' s your point ?
what' s up , anton ?
how' s it going , brother ?
nice boxers .
pass the chronic .
i' m sorry , man .
this bong is cashed .
you said you was holding .
i didn' t say what i was holding .
that' s messed up .
i hear if you combine nutmeg and oregano you can get pretty wasted .
all you do is smoke pot ... ... and watch tv all day .
don' t get me wrong .
that' s what life is all about .
but don' t you think you should have some ambition , a goal ?
i mean , my dream life would be ... ... to lie around and watch tv while some hot broad delivers me food .
until your parents kick your oily ass out .
i haven' t seen my parents in a few days .
maybe they' re dead .
party at anton' s .
what are you doing ?
with a killer loose , you can' t rule out murder .
what killer ?
don' t you watch the news ?
i hate that fucking show .
our little town is in the national spotlight .
local mailman , iced .
barmaid at the bowling alley , iced .
you haven' t heard about the twins ?
they were jerking off in the milkshake maker again ?
iced times two .
last night , when they were working at burger jungle .
damn .
anton , here comes your woman .
he' s got serious problems .
molly' s lived across the street for , like , what , ever ?
tell her about your obsession with her .
start by telling her your name .
yeah , man .
she' s waiting for you .
she' s not waiting for me .
would you stop being such a puss and go , like , ask her to the dance .
what dance ?
if you' d been to school recently , you' d know .
halloween thing in the gym ?
9 : 00 curfew ?
no trick or treating allowed ?
dumb dance is the only option .
you guys going ?
hell , no .
can you see us in stupid ass costumes ?
grooving to hanson and jewel ?
what do we look like , total losers , man ?
i see your point .
she dropped her lyrics book .
she' il catch you reading that over her shoulder in biology .
her songs are badass .
she' s like a poet or something .
go bring it back to her .
be like a knight in shining armor .
she' d be all grateful , invite me in , offer me a drink , i' d accept .
she' d rip your clothes off ... ... and make sweet love to you , red shoe diary style .
right .
could happen .
just go talk to her , man !
maybe she' il think you' re funny .
you know what ?
i think i' m going to .
you want to borrow some pants , chief ?
first impressions and all .
you' re a bud .

okay , i did it .
but it was an accident .
i can' t believe you told me to smoke that shit !
okay , anton .
i have to leave now .
yeah , that' s probably a good idea .
it' s the basement !
you can' t get out that way !
why are you doing this ?
i don' t know !
it' s me , pnub !
your buddy !
i know who you are .
i don' t want to hurt you .
then don' t !
it' s not me !
it' s my hand !
it' s like i have no control over my hand !
i don' t know how long i can hold it .
run !

it' s going to be okay .
i won' t tell anybody .

jesus , look at you .
i was looking for my cat .
we got in a fight .
you sure got your ass kicked .
i did okay .
so you ran and hid in my bush .
i shouldn' t be here .
i' m not myself today .
i' m someone completely different .
you' re so shy .
it' s okay , i get it .
so let' s skip this chickening out , sneaking around stage .
no , you don' t understand .
i' m
do you want to come inside and talk ?
you never gave me a chance to thank you .
that book is important to me .
so ... ... nothing cooler than a chick bass guitar player .
especially one that writes her own lyrics .
you read them ?
i couldn' t help looking in the book .
they' re amazing .
look , i even got my favorites memorized .
devil girl with nothing to lose
she got wind in herhair and gum on her shoes
i was 1 3 when i wrote that .
yeah , well ... ... they' re amazing .
thanks .
i should not be here , molly .
safer in here than on the streets .
there' s a killer out there .
that' s exactly what i' m saying .
i' m dangerous .
oh , yeah ?
how dangerous ?
i' m not kidding .
i' ve done stuff , you know ?
i' m impressed .
i never would' ve thought you' d have the balls to just grab me like that .
me neither .
you' re kinky .
that' s me .
move it , people !
let' s go !
some of us are on serious missions here .
there' s evil out there and i got to kick its ass !
shit , my parents are home .
we' il pick this up later .
my parents might take offense to some bloody boy banging their daughter .
tomorrow .
you want to see me ?
come by at seven .
the curfew' s annihilated our options , but we can go to the dance .
i thought you said the streets weren' t safe .
i' il protect you .
dearly beloved ... ... we' re gathered here today because you' re all dead .
and it' s my fault .
mom , dad ... ... what can i say ?
i mean ... ... you brought me into this world ... ... you put a roof over my head , you fed me until i killed you .
if you look at it that way , i haven' t been a good son , but i' m really ... ... really , really sorry .
and wherever you are ... ... l just want you to forgive me ... ... because i' m going to try to change .
mick ... ... pnub , guys ....
you guys were the greatest .
i' m never going to forget the way we sat around all day ... ... watched tv and got really stoned .
and all those other times where we just ....
i guess that' s all we did .
amen .
over here .
anton , help me .
come on , man .
i can' t breathe down here .
anton , can you hear me ?
yeah , man , mick .
now get me out of here .
you' re dead .
no , i' m not .
you conked my head pretty good .
i must' ve been unconscious .
you think ?
i know , fucker , now dig me up !
stay where you are , mick !
please don' t kill me .
watch it , man !
what did i take last night ?
that dream was intense .
intense .
turn it up .
check it out .
yeah , i' m watching .
did you see ?
guys !
that' s funny .
thank god you' re alive , because i had this dream that i killed
oh , shit !
sorry about that thing with the shovel .
you' re dead .
easy , tiger .
undead , actually .
you said you were unconscious .
you lied .
you killed me , all right ?
try and keep this thing in perspective .
i was bitter about the getting killed by my best friend thing ... ... but i got over it .
so why you here ?
we need a place to kick it .
don' t be selfish .
no one else' s parents are dead .
no , not why are you " here " here .
i mean ....
are you flesh eating zombies back from hell to exact revenge ?
is that it ?
why would we go to hell ?
we' re not bad .
it' s not like we' re good , but at least we don' t kill people !
i didn' t kill anybody on purpose .
yeah , well , we weren' t in hell .
there was this bright light at the end of a long tunnel .
there were all these chicks ' voices .
and that music .
music ?
kind of uncool music , like enya .
and these chicks were saying ... ... " come to us .
come towards the light .
so what happened ?
we figured , fuck it .
i mean , it was really far .
i' ve got to ask .
what' s with the hand ?
it doesn' t obey me at all .
the only thing i can come up with is it' s got to be possessed .
do you guys know anything about satan or evil or ... ?
but we know somebody who does .
did you know them well ?
not really .
you ?
yeah , they were great .
i just feel really bad , you know ?
because i was always so mean to them .
like this one time , they asked me to go out on a double date ... ... and i thought they were ' tards , because there' s only one of me .
so i told them to go blow each other .
did they ?
the way you treated them ... ... the guilt must be making you feel like shit inside .
randy !
you still in high school ?
yeah , me , i got out about three years ago .
i need your help .
what are you playing , a little two ball ?
look , i got to talk to you .
serious stuff is going on .
anton , can' t you see i' m getting a little action over here ?
oh , man .
i can' t believe you cock blocked me like that .
i thought we were buds .
randy , wait !
i didn' t mean to mess you up .
listen .
i need your help .
piss off !
fresh tomatoes ....
hey !
who are you ?
new .
drive thru duty .
excuse me .
sorry .
break time .
all right .
give me the big five with the spicy safari fries ... ... the african apple turnover ... ... and the raspberry rainforest shake .
slap some extra mustard on that jungle burger .
tell me everything you know about the devil .
are you out of your fucking mind ?
you listen to satanic music .
you must' ve picked up something .
look , it' s just music .
like mozart and that other fag ....
keep it clean .
who , beethoven ?
that' s the guy .
it' s just like their music , only louder .
you got to know .
i' m desperate .
oh , man !
here !
asshole !
it' s my hand .
it' s like it' s got a mind of its own .
it makes me do things i don' t want it to do .
i used to be like that .
get into all kinds of stupid shit .
look , the trick is ... ... to keep yourself busy .
that' s why i' m always working on the ford .
keeps me out of trouble .
idle hands are the devil' s playground .
keep my hands busy .
yeah , that actually makes sense .
thanks .
you' re the coolest .
so do you , like , knit now ?
don' t take this the wrong way , but you look queer doing that .
randy broke it down for me .
ldle hands are the devil' s playpen .
so i' m thinking ... ... keep my hands occupied , right ?
man , that saying' s not literal .
it' s more like ... ... you know ....
metaphorical ?
right .
this is the noise complaint .
ain' t this the tobias residence ?
holy shit !
it' s anton .
he' s the killer !
i better call for backup .
are you crazy ?
and let the feds get the credit ?
lf we collar him , we' il be heroes .
we can' t go in without a warrant .
piss on the bill of rights !
we got just cause .
freeze !
yeah , freeze !
guys ... ... what do i do ?
i think you
i was going to say do what the officers tell you ... ... but now i changed my mind .
you should just kill them .
they' re alive !
they are not !
you shot one in the head !
they' re morgue meat .
look , guys .
i don' t want to kill anybody else .
you don' t want to go to jail , though .
jail .
that' s it !
they' il throw me in a rubber room .
i can' t hurt anybody else .
cuff me !
okay .
just ... ... drop the knitting needles .
that' s not a good idea .
why don' t you just cuff me ?
drop the needles and put your hands on your head !
i can' t !
put down the needles and come quietly .
cuff me !
put the needles down !
now !
cuff me !
put them down !
put them down !
cuff me !
go , go , buffalo !
stop !
i didn' t do it .
it was my hand .
it' s like , the knitting didn' t help at all .
i told you that saying was more , like , metaphorical .
i can' t keep doing this !
i' m losing my mind .
get your head .
no way .
it' s the only thing i can think of .
once that hand is gone , how will you cut off the other one ?
the left one' s a keeper .
i mean , i guess it wasn' t idle enough .
are you sure ?
i use it for a lot of things .
i light up , i change the remote ... ... l relieve a little tension .
this is the answer .
i know it .
those things won' t even cut my bagel .
shit !
grab the carver .
look at me !
i' m leatherface !
thanks , mick .
i' il just use this one .
i can' t watch .
you missed .
pnub ... ... bite down .
don' t cut me , man !
you scream like a girl .
what the hell are you doing ?
i got to stop the blood flow .
don' t you watch er ?
look at that nasty thing .
that' il be infected for sure .
you got any antiseptic , anton ?
i don' t know .
pnub' s got some in a first aid kit in his house .
and burritos .
you' il be okay , buddy .
we' il be back in a sec to fix you up , anton .
catch you on the flip flop .
oh , shit !
anton , are you home ?
don' t come in !
just stay there , okay ?
very funny , anton .
stay out there , molly !
i' m freezing my butt off .
anton , we' re going to be late .
anton , i can hear you in there !
stay outside !
come on , anton !
let' s go !
we' re going to be late !
we' re going to miss the band .
fry !
gross .
anton , i' m coming in .
wait !
you look incredible .
thanks .
but you should' ve called .
if you needed more time with your costume , fine .
but i hate waiting .
so what are you supposed to be , anyway ?
i' m a ... ... fast food employee that cut off his own hand .
cute .
come on !
anton , we' re back !
we got antiseptic and adhesive bandages !
the ouch free kind !
microwave for three minutes and enjoy .
this is getting on my nerves .
what are you doing ?
could you ... ?
this way .
easy .
that' s better .
all right .
thanks , man !
gross !
maybe we should clean it first .
while we' re at it , we can clean the whole house .
this ain' t our mess .
look , i can' t go to the dance yet , okay ?
i' m sorry .
my parents will be home in a few minutes .
if they see the mess i made , they' il kill me .
look , i won' t be too long .
i' il meet you there .
is something wrong ?
you need to go there now ... ... and you can' t stop till you' re inside with everyone .
you wouldn' t stand me up , would you ?
not a chance , babysnakes .
i' il get the next one .
shit !
i bit my tongue .
that' s disgusting .
i bet i can fix that for you .
hold still .
that' s better .
burrito , burrito
wait , wait !
don' t open it !
i' m sorry , there were only two .
no !
you let the hand out !
we brought you a first aid kit .
where did it go ?
what ?
you mean the hand ?
of course , the hand .
try looking up your ass .
damn .
hey , foxy .
looking for a ball ?
because i could help you find one that' s the right size for you .
what the hell ?
try and keep up .
i' d be happy to keep up with you , sweet thing .
didn' t you have a dance to go to ?
that' s right .
we got to do our costumes .
you coming , randy ?
i think i can find myself a ride .
all right .
so what brings you to bolan ?
you don' t want to know .
no , seriously .
i' m interested .
really ?
here it goes .
i' m a druidic priestess sworn to fight a certain evil force ... ... that possesses the laziest fuckup it can find .
it will kill as many people as possible ... ... and then drag a free soul into the netherworld .
that' s some weighty shit there .
here' s the kicker .
i have the one thing that can stop this from happening .
i just need to find the bastard whose hand is possessed .
weird .
earlier today , this guy , anton , told me that his hand was doing stuff ... ... that he didn' t want it to do .
don' t you fuck with me !
ease up , there , kitten .
i' m telling you the truth .
this guy was freaked !
show me where he lives .
left !
turn left !
guys !
we got to go to the dance .
the hand , it' s after molly .
let' s check out the dance .
i' il win best costume .
chicks dig winners .
i' il probably hook up .
yeah , because severed heads are one of the top ten big turn ons .
it kills me to see you stressed out .
you cut off your hand in the interest of however many others .
it' s not your problem anymore .
so what i want you to do is take a little anton time .
just relax and kick back , my man .
no , no .
you know what ?
not this time , okay ?
i' m through with that .
all i do is sit around .
i veg out , i watch tv , i smoke pot

yes , of course .
what' s taking so long ?
ls this the supervisor ?
what do you mean my credit card is no good ?
well , you must have the wrong number .
no , it' s 8 4 6 8 .

i think you' ve been a bad girl ... ... and i want to spank you with my ruler .
yes , that' s nice .
that is nice .

you won' t go anywhere , evil hosting fuck stick .
nobody touches my ford !
come on , debi .

wait , wait !
i' m not a host .
okay , look .
the evil was in my hand , all right ?
i cut it off .
okay ?
oh , shit !
you let it loose ?
that was probably a mistake .
no kidding .
and now it' s after my girlfriend .
you got a girlfriend ?
i got to stop it .
it' s out for blood .
that ain' t all it' s out for .
if your girl' s the one it' s after , then at midnight ... ... it' s taking her to hell .

pnub' s a lot more creative than i thought .
i mean , he' s actually kind of cool .

i don' t know if he did it or
wait , wait !

we can' t go through the blade !
we' il be pulverized !
give me your shoe !
what are you going to do ?
no , no .
oh , god , it' s too far !
i can' t drop that far !
we' il die in this vent !
we won' t die .
we' il die here .
the rats will eat us , and nobody will find us .
okay , we' re good .
be careful .
all right , let' s go !
this would be more comfortable if your ass wasn' t so wide .
this is dumb .
anton needs our help .
the best thing about being dead is zero responsibility .
that' s tanya .
let' s save her .

she needs me .
she needs you like a fish needs

grab the cord and come down !
i can' t .
i can' t , i' m scared !
