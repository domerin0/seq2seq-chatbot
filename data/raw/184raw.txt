i' m not a guest .

thanks .
that' s , johnny ross .
yes , sir .
sorry , sir , nothing .
nothing ?
are you sure ?
i' m sure , sir .
okay , thanks .
thank you .
yes , i' m sure it was him .
sunshine cab , 6912 .
would you pull up ?
i want to make a call .
right .
yeah ?
delgetti .
what is it ?
wo r k .
frank , let me in , will you ?
what time did you get to bed this morning , frank ?
about 5 : 00 .
mumps vaccine on the market .
the government authorized yesterday ...
... what officials term the first clearly effective vaccine to prevent mumps .
... announced it has granted a license for the vaccine ...
... at 12 : 45 wednesday ...
why don' t you just relax and have your orange juice , and shut up , delgetti ?
let' s go , frank .
lt. bullitt to see you , mr. chalmers .
it was purely unintentional , i assure you .
it wasn' t that i was so well informed , it was just that he was so ill informed .
would you excuse me for a moment , please ?
what do you like about ... ?
in orinda , we have all this beautiful dry sunshine .
absolutely perfect for roses .
i do all my own work .
see my hands ?
they prove it .
hello .
lieutenant , how are you ?
thanks for coming over .
name is frank , isn' t it ?
that' s right .
please call me walter .
i have an important job for you .
captain bennet suggested that you take it .
as you know , there is a senate subcommittee hearing here monday .
i have a star witness who needs protection .
sam said that you were the man for the job .
and i can' t find a flaw in that statement .
protection from who ?
the organization .
his name is ross .
johnny ross .
from chicago .
once and for all , the top men in law enforcement are united .
we' re going to expose the organization .
i read your speech .
why san francisco ?
ross is safer here .
that' s your province .
keeping him out of reach for 40 hours .
where ?
the hotel daniels .
226 embarcadero road .
room 634 .
he' s there now , expecting you .
now that you know where my house is ... ... i hope that we' il get to see a lot more of each other .
particularly in view of the investigation .
a senatorial hearing has a way of ... ... catapulting everyone involved into the public eye ... ... with a subsequent effect on one' s career .
it will be a pleasure to have you along .
have him in court on monday , frank .
what was that all about ?
pals .
you and chalme r s , huh ?
the r e' s a lot of juice ?
hotel daniels , 226 embarcadero road .
state' s evidence witness , and we' re babysitting .

mr. chalmers said you' d be here by 5 : 00 .
he guaranteed me that .
oh , sorry , we got held up in traffic .
got any firearms ?
no , man , i' ve got nothing on me .
just my wallet ... ... cigarette lighter .
want to check me out yourself ?
no , that' s not necessary .
put that stuff on the bed , will you , please ?
how did you ... how did you get here from chicago ?
i flew .
sure none of the boys were on the plane with you , or saw you get on ?
how would i know ?
i wouldn' t know .
why did you pick this room to hole up ?
i didn' t pick it .
chalmers picked it .
why ?
stay away from those windows !
that' s why .
sit down and relax , ross .
it' s a long wait until monday morning .
we' d better get a fix on some food .
what ?
some food .
i know chalmers wants you to be happy , and we' il do the best we can .
dad , it' s for you .
listen , you' re not going .

what do you know about ross ?
chicago .
it could be very big .
h e had access to all the r eco r ds .
h e r an the w i r e se rv ices w ith his b r othe r , p ete .
did chalmers ask for me ?
uh huh .
do you happen to know why ?
yes , i know why .
he' s grooming himself for public office .
you make good copy .
they lo v e you in the pape r s , f r ank .
i see .
okay .
so long , sam .
say , who were you talking to about me on that telephone ?
mr. chalmers said this was just between me and him .
me and him , and that' s all .
delgetti will take the first shift .
stanton will be on at 12 : 00 .
i' il take the third .
all you have to worry about is to stay away from the windows .
especially at night .
you call me before you leave .
excuse me .
fire escape and the freeway .
bad news , right ?
right .
want me to stay ?
no .
go on home to your wife .
what shift ?
second .
if we work on the weekend , we get two days off ?
so long .
hi .
hi .
is this the new fountain ?
fountain ?

i thought that , money didn' t matter to artists .
it costs money to have a soul .
friction loss of water in feet per hundred feet .
length of pipe ...
formula using constant one hundred size of standard pipe in inches .
i want to use 600 gallons of water per minute .
now what' s the velocity per second of a five inch pipe ?
look to the extreme right .
now go down the figures until you find 600 .
got it .
now go across until you find the five inch pipe column .
what does it say ?
nine point eight .
now i want the loss in feet .
feet , huh ?

but i' ve got to know , now .
the two men .

caucasian .
the one who fired , about 5 foot 10 .
white hair .
gun , winchester pump .
all i remember .

what is it ?
what' s his blood pressure now ?

it' s down to 90 over 70 .
suture .
scissors .

h e' s d r opping .
p ulse is also going up , no w .
what was it pre op ?
bp pre op was 140 over 90 .
kahn , take this .
now it' s down to 90 over 70 .
how much blood do you have ?
we have four up here , and we' ve ordered four more units .
how much have you given him ?
we' re starting the first one right now .
you' d better bring me another one .
mayo , please .
this is the subclavian .
here' s your wipe , doctor .
thank you , deanne .
what are his chances ?
no more than 50 50 .
we stopped the hemorrhaging , but they got some of the major blood vessels .
thank you , doctor .
how is he doing ?
holding .
stanton ?
okay .
he' s sleeping now .
i want to talk to you .
i got the report back from the lab .
nothing at the hotel .
how come they got in ?
ross got to the door , unhooked the chain from the inside .
he let the killers in himself ?
why would he do a thing like that ?
i' m waiting to ask him .
what about the setup ?
what do you think about that ?
shotgun and a backup man .
professionals .
yep .
i had to call chalmers .
and ?
it didn' t go down too good .
it' s the main event for him .
you kno w , the senate subcommittee hea r ing .
h e can' t p r oduce the big su r p r ise he p r omised e v e r yone .
he may try to make up some mileage by laying it on us .
play it by the book from now on .
does chalmers run the case , or do i ?
all i' m interested in is results .
do whatever you think is best .
i' il try to back you up .
excuse me , sir .
are you the policeman who hasn' t eaten ?
yes , ma' am .
thank you .
surely .
where is he ?
how is he , doctor ?
as well as can be expected .
he' s still under the anesthesia .
i' m walter chalmers .
is there any possibility of my getting a deposition from ross before monday ?
that' s impossible to say at this time .
he may remain in shock .
i thank you for doing all you can , doctor .
get the supervisor .
now , what went wrong , lieutenant ?
who else knew where he was ?
what ?
who else knew where he was ?
what are you implying ?
they knew where to look for him and they used your name to get in .
are you suggesting i disclosed his whereabouts ?
somebody did .
and it didn' t come from us .
that' s hardly the issue .
well , it certainly is .
i' ve got an officer with a family .
and he' s shot up pretty bad .
and i' ve got a witness who can' t talk .
i want to know about ross .
what was the deal you made with him ?
deal ?
lieutenant , don' t try to evade the responsibility .
in your parlance , you blew it .
you knew the significance of his testimony .
yet you failed to take adequate measures to protect him .
so to you it was a job .
no more .
were it more , and you had the dedication i was led to believe ...
you believe what you want .
you work your side of the street and i' il work mine .
lieutenant , i shall personally officiate at your public crucifixion ... ... if ross doesn' t recover during the course of the hearing ... ... so i can at least present his deposition .
and , i assure you , i shall not suffer the consequence of your incompetence .
and even if there wasn' t any ... ... l' m rather certain i can prove negligence on your part .
there may be another attempt on his life .
i' il be back in the morning , with my people .
thank you , doctor .
i' d like to have dr. willard replaced .
i think he' s too young and inexperienced .
i' d prefer my surgeon .
inform the administrator .
but dr. willard is one of our ...
i' d like him replaced , if you don' t mind .
i' il report this to our administrator .
thank you very much .
doctor ?
a relative of mine , he' s here with a gunshot wound .
could you please tell me where i can find him ?
why don' t you try at the reception desk ?
there' s no one there .
he could be up on the second floor in the emergency room .
thanks , doctor .
yes ?
oh , lieutenant .
it' s for you .
thank you .
yes ?
dr. kenner .
this probably isn' t important ... ... but a man asked me whether a relative of his ... ... with a gunshot wound was in the hospital .
i thought you should know about it .
was he about 5 foot 10 ?
gray hair ?
i' m afraid i told him that he was on the second floor .
thank you .
delgetti .
our man is in the building .
he was tipped where to find ross .
you take the ground floor , okay ?
got it .
get in ross' s room .
nobody in except dr. willard and the nurses .
there' s a man down the stairs !
polly , call anesthesia and bring the crash cart !
doctor , there' s a cardiac arrest in icu .
get delgetti .
you and the patrolman cover the lobby .
okay .
i can' t get a blood pressure .
go .
do you want to defibrillate again ?
not now .
not with that complex .
how much bicarb ?
fifteen .
go ahead .
push it in .
do you want some lactose ?
draw some up .
any pupillary reaction ?
no .
dilated .
get some calcium up , too .
what' s that no w ?
what' s he got ?
n o acti v ity .
i need some mo r e epineph r in .
h alf a millig r am , please .
i need your help .
what is it ?
i want this kept open .
if chalmers finds out that ross died , he' il fold this up .
i want the man who killed him !
i understand .
i don' t want your head on a block .
i understand .
his chart could be misplaced .
you filed it .
it' s missing .
i' il take the responsibility .
all right .
call the coroner' s office .
tell them to put ross under a john doe .
i want a private ambulance , unmarked , and i want it quiet .
far as you go , doctor .
take it slow .
city morgue .
let' s go .
fresh today !
see if dr. willard is still in the hospital .
get lt. bullitt on the phone .
i' m sorry , joe .
he' s been transferred to another room .
may i have an outside line , please ?
may i speak to your supervisor , please ?
i' m afraid she' s busy at the moment .
i' d be grateful if you would tell her that chalmers wishes to see her .
immediately .
it' s very urgent .
yes , mr. chalmers .
i' d like to speak w ith dr .
willa r d , please .
thank you .
yes ?
can i help you ?
i wanted the other supervisor .
the night supervisor went off duty an hour ago .
i' m mrs. francis .
may i help you ?
you may , indeed .
there was a patient here .
his name is johnny ross .
and he seems to have disappeared .
disappeared ?
he was in intensive care , but there' s no record of his whereabouts in the hospital .
that' s impossible .
may i see his medical chart , please ?
i' m sorry but hospital regulations ...
it' s an official police request .
is it not , captain baker ?
yes , captain .
i' il take care of it .
excuse me , but dr. willard has gone off duty .
call him at home .
are you sure he' s not there ?
do you have dr. willard' s home number ?
i' m sorry , but there has been ... ... some medical complication as regard to my witness .
i' m afraid i' il have to forego that bedside picture ... ... as much as it would' ve compensated for his inability to testify tomorrow .
but , in all decency , i can hardly force the issue .
does this mean your surprise witness won' t be able to make any statement ?
the man was near death when he was brought in here .
in view of the attempt on his life ... ... l' m sure you can understand my reasons for secrecy .
yeah , of course .
good to see you again .
can' t reach lt. bullitt , either .
keep trying .
i can' t find mr. ross' s medical chart .
it' s evidently been misplaced .
or appropriated .
appropriated ?
all right .
i' il inform the administrator .
thank you very much .
i want a complete list of the staff who might' ve been involved ... ... in helping bullitt spirit johnny ross out of here .
i' m certain he grabbed my witness for his personal aggrandizement .
i' il lay odds on that .
and find ross !
i' il get on that right away .
mr. chalmers , i have lt. bullitt .
where' s my witness ?
i' ve got him .
where is he ?
are you going to tell me or not ?
well , i can' t at the present time .
captain baker would like to have a word with you .
now , listen to me , lieutenant .
nail him .
i want him written off .
no problem .
you want some breakfast ?
just coffee .
thank you .
for what ?
is it open ?
the door' s open , sir .
now think back to the time the two of them first came in and you saw them .
anything you can remember ?
like i said .
they hit me before i got a chance to look at them .
i don' t remember nothin ' about them .
nothin ' .
start remembering .
i can' t !
and that' s the honest truth .
delgetti , take him downtown .
lieutenant , give him a chance , will you ?
he' s trying .
he' s not trying hard enough .
it will come to him .
you' re wasting your time .
okay .
come on .
one thing about the guy who hit me ...
he had a square face .
there wasn' t much light here .
they try to save on electricity .
like this ?
no .
thinner .
that' s it .
now it' s coming back .
let' s go to the guy in 634 .
no luggage ?
that' s right , sir .
and he didn' t store anything ?
no , sir .
he came in empty , which means you gave him a good look over .
always do .
they' re the ones i give the eye to .
then you saw how he arrived ?
yes , sir .
in a cab .
what line ?
sunshine cab .
now , the guy who hit you .
how old was he ?
oh , about 50 .
what was his hair like ?
gray .
getting bald .
bald on both sides .
that ?
no , balder .
am i helping you , sir ?
i never had it so good .
his first stop was the mark .
how long ?
not long .
pull over there and wait .
h ello .
eddy ?
dues time .
i need some information on a johnny ross .
chicago .
gi v e me half an hou r .
m eet you at en r ico' s .
right .
two .
two what ?
calls .
he called twice .
the second was long distance .
how do you know it was long distance ?
he put in a lot of change .
good morning , sam .
i don' t believe i' ve had the pleasure .
this is mr. chalmers .
my wife , mrs. bennet .
my son , paul .
my son , tony .
tony , how are you ?
would you mind if i had just a moment alone with sam ?
no , of course not .
must be difficult raising children in the world of today .
i presume tony is a college student .
yes , that' s right .
i can well imagine the financial strain ... ... of sending a boy to university on the salary of a captain .
there' s no reason why a man with your potential ... ... shouldn' t move right up , given the right support .
my family is waiting for me , mr. chalmers .
bullitt abducted my witness .
he removed him from the hospital .
as his superior officer , i' ve given him complete charge of the case .
if he' s moving ross around , it' s for a reason .
so you mean that you would not order him to reveal where he' s keeping ross ?
it' s his case , mr. chalmers .
captain , i' m serving you with a writ of habeas corpus ... ... making you responsible for the delivery of ross .
duly observed ... ... you have received it .
now i need that witness to prove his very existence .
excuse me , sir .
dad , mom is waiting .
would you excuse us for just another moment , tony ?
i don' t choose to have people accuse me of false promises ... ... for the sake of cheap sensationalism ... ... or to be compromised by your lieutenant .
or castrated .
wait for me .
i won' t be long .
according to my sources , the organization , chicago branch ... ... caught johnny ross with his hands in the till .
they estimate he siphoned off ... ... about two million bucks while operating their wire service .
the story is they tried to get rid of him .
friday night .
chicago .
chicago ?
he got away unharmed .
they believe he' s hiding here in town .
how old is this information , eddy ?
four hours .
they' re looking for him all over town , frank .
they' ve staked out the docks , the airport , to keep him from leaving the country .
anyone else trying for a hit ?
haven' t heard of any such likelihood .
what about his brother , pete ?
in the clear .
okay , eddy .
thanks .
anything i can do for you ?
there is something .
remember zash zhoe ?
they gave him three to five .
what is he in for ?
receiving stolen property .
i' il try .
thanks , frank .
here you go .
take care , lieutenant .
