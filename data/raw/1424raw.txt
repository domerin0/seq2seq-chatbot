another village has died .
let' s go .
this place too , will soon sink into the wasteland .
1000 years after the collapse of the giant industrial civilization , rust and ceramic fragments covered the land .
over this wasteland , a deadly forest of fungi spreads , releasing poisonous vapors .
the spread of this wasteland threatens the existence of the remnants of the human race .
nausicaa of the valley of the wind
an ohmu track .
it' s still fresh .
a shed ohmu shell .
magnificent .
i' ve never seen such a perfect shell .
good sound .
it chipped a ceramic sword .
the valley people will be happy .
they won' t have to worry about materials for making tools for a long time .
what an amazing eye .
maybe i can fly back with this one .
got it .
it' s so light .
the mushibayashi plants are spreading their afternoon spores .
how beautiful .
yet , this is a deadly forest .
if not for my mask , it would destroy my lungs in five minutes .
who ?
what can it be ?
it' s an insect gun !
someone is being attacked by the insects .
sorry !
what ?
a great pillar of spores .
ohmu ? !
it must be the one that shed that skin .
you can' t escape that way .
please , see the signal !
he answered !
he' s coming this way !
why , that' s
what a splendid ohmu .
to the windward side !
thanks .
ohmu , go back to your forest .
this side isn' t your world .
see ?
be a good child .
he' s forgotten himself with anger .
i' il have to calm him down .
the ohmu' s been stunned by the flare !
an insect whistle .
ohmu , open your eyes .
let' s go home to the forest .
it' s awake !
the ohmu' s returning to the forest .
with only flare bombs and an insect whistle , she managed to calm the ohmu .
lord yupa !
nausicaa , you' ve grown !
it' s been a year and a half !
father will be ecstatic .
i must thank you .
you' ve become a fine wind rider .
no , father says not yet .
oh , yes ...
i completely forgot about this fellow .
wow !
a fox squirrel !
i' ve never seen one before .
this fellow was kidnapped by a bird louse .
i mistook him for a human baby and i ended up using my gun .
so that' s why the ohmu was so angry .
it seems he didn' t inhale any poison because he was unconscious .
no , you shouldn' t put out your hand like that .
he' s small , but ferocious .
come ...
hey ...
there' s nothing to fear .
don' t be afraid .
you were only scared , weren' t you ?
master yupa , would you give him to me ?
ah i won' t mind , but
thank you .
kai and kui .
do you remember me ?
such a mysterious power .
are you tired ?
you' ve run a lot !
how' s everyone doing ?
what' s the matter ?
it' s father !
father can' t fly anymore .
jhil ?
the forest' s poison ?
yes .
it' s the fate of all who live near the wasteland , i' m told .
i should have visited earlier .
no it was really good of you to come .
teacher !
later , i want you to seeomething .
my secret room !
don' t tell anyone lest they be frightened .
i' il go on ahead to tell everyone you' re coming .
you hurry , too .
master yupa !
would you carry this for me please ?
it disrupts the air currents so i can' t fly well .
my , she reads the wind well .
come , just a little further .
master yupa !
welcome !
is everyone well ?
both water and wind are calm , without problems .
master yupa !
ah , everyone' s well , i hope ?
it' s master yupa .
we' ve been waiting for you , master yupa .
princess !
he' s arrived !
just a second .
master yupa !
uncle mito !
working hard , i see .
tell us some more of those foreign stories tonight !
ok .
turn it .
it looks good .
oh , it' s a really good one .
we must set out first thing tomorrow to get it .
okay , toeto ?
master yupa !
this is toeto' s child , who was born this year .
oh , let me see .
she' s a fine girl .
reminds me of nausicaa when she was young .
would you please be this child' s godfather ?
so that a good wind will always blow for her .
i accept .
i' il give her a good name .
thank you .
may she grow as healthy as the princess .
yeah .
if we' re talking about health , the princess if famous for it .
but it wouldn' t do if the child imitated the princess' s playing in the wastelands as well .
but thanks to that , i found that ohmu shell .
well , put yourself in my shoes as the steward .
i can' t sleep easily at night from worry .
if we consider the ohmu' s shells ,
we can' t say that the princess' s playing is for nothing .
that' s true .
i was rescued , too , wasn' t i ?
saved by this child ?
this valley is good .
every time i come here , my heart is soothed .
how were your travels this time ?
it' s terrible .
in the south , the wasteland has swallowed two more countries .
the wastelands are steadily expanding .
wherever i go , there' s only hunger and warfare ... ... and ominous shadows .
why can' t they live like you in this valley ?
it' s because here we are protected by the blessed wind that blows from the sea .
the poisons from the wasteland cannot reach this valley .
how about it yupa ?
why don' t you settle in this valley soon ?
i' m in this condition .
everybody would be glad .
that' s impossible .
yupa is a man destined to continue his search .
destined , you say ?
grandmother , what do you mean by " search " ?
my , my ...
you didn' t know , nausicaa ?
there it' s in that tapestry on the wall .
i can' t see it any more ... ... but it' s the lord on the left corner .
that one , wearing a robe of blue , shall descend onto a golden field .
to forge once again the lost bond with the land .
and lead everyone , at last , to a land of blue purity .
master yupa , i thought that it was only and old legend .
grandmother !
you vex us with your teasing .
same thing , isn' t it ?
i only want to solve the riddle of the wastelands .
are we , the human race , destined to be swallowed by the wastelands and be destroyed ?
i want to see and judge for myself .
if only i could help master yupa .
princess .
princess !
what is it , mito ?
goll says he smells something in the wind .
it' s almost dawn , isn' t it ?
i' il be right there .
good work .
it' s a good storm ... ... but something' s strange .
there !
see , again !
it' s a plane .
why would a plane be in a borderland like this ?
what' s happening ?
master yupa !
it' s a plane .
a plane ?
it' s coming !
it' s huge !
it' s a giant torumekian ship !
it' s flying strangely .
it' s trying to make an emergency landing .
goll !
get me up !
princess !
that' s absurd !
i' il guide them to the coast !
they' ve turned around !
here goes !
teto !
how could they ?
they must have been in the wasteland and killed some insects .
pull up !
you' re going to crash !
pull up !
up !
it crashed .
princess
it' s at the seaside cliff .
let' s go !
move it , let' s go !
all who are able , hurry up !
it' s that girl .
she' s alive .
where ?
the valley of the wind .
you mustn' t speak .
i am ... ... rastol of pejite .
the cargo ...
please burn the cargo .
the cargo ?
please burn it .
the cargo .
i understand .
it' s all right .
everything burned .
thank god .
princess !
this lady ...
she' s a princess of the royal house of pejite .
an insect !
an ushiyabu is still alive !
damn !
it' s calling other insects !
it' s hurt and can' t fly .
bring your guns here !
that' s no good !
if we shoot , it' il call more of its kind !
i' il kill it on the first shot .
you can' t kill an ushiyabu with a gun !
then what ?
wait .
mito , bring mehve , please .
right .
princess !
go back to the forest .
it' s all right !
you can fly .
that' s a good child .
princess .
thanks .
thank god .
who knows what would happen if we killed even one of them .
ohmu ?
found one !
over here !
here it is .
there were spores on that ship after all .
they haven' t given off any poisons yet .
we' re almost done .
yup .
if even one remains , it would be a disaster .
what is this thing ?
it didn' t burn , even in the fire .
well , everybody , we' il return to investigate this later .
please go help burn the spores .
be extra careful .
really , what a mess they' ve dumped on us .
mito ...
look here .
it' s moving .
it' s as if it' s alive .
master yupa , what is this ?
in my travels , i heard of an ominous rumor .
it said that a monster from the ancient world was excavated from beneath the city of pejite , where it had been sleeping .
a monster from the ancient world ?
it' s a god warrior .
a god warrior ? !
you mean those that burned the world in the seven days of fire ?
this thing ?
all the god warriors should have become fossils by now .
but , this one managed to sleep underground for a thousand years .
now that you mention it , it does seem to have human characteristics .
torumekia is a large military state in the far west .
and , with these dead captives from pejite ... i' m worried .
please take care of the rest .
what can it be ?
it' s a torumekian ship .
everyone , to the castle !
everyone , to the castle !
everyone !
to the castle !
everyone , head for the castle !
to the castle !
father !
hide , grandmother .
i' il stay here .
i' il stay here .
princess !
how could you ? !
nausicaa !
you !
don' t move !
if you do , this knife , shaved from the shell of an ohmu ... ... will pierce even your ceramic armor .
that man it' s master yupa .
i ask the torumekian army .
last night , the people of this valley worked furiously to save your ship .
even now , they just finished carefully burying your dead .
though it may have been a small thing , is this the courtesy of torumekia towards such a country ?
if you' re starting a war , you should give a reason .
you should first send a messenger and state your complaints .
nausicaa calm down , nausicaa .
if we fight now , everyone in the valley will be slaughtered .
we must remain alive and wait for our chance .
that wench !
stop it , kurotowa .
but
oh hell .
what a bitch !
she killed off everyone .
your admonition pains my ears .
aren' t you yupa miralda , the best swordsman in the borderlands ?
our objective is not massacre .
i want to talk .
i ask that you sheathe your sword .
look !
it' s the princess !
listen !
these are the words of her highness kushana ...
commander of the borderland expeditionary force of the torumekian empire !
we have come to unite the borderland countries ... ... to construct a land without worry .
you are on the verge of being engulfed by the wastelands .
obey us .
cooperate in our undertaking !
burn the wasteland !
take back our world !
burn the wasteland ?
is that possible ?
we have revived the miraculous skills and powers that once made the human race ... ... the masters of this planet .
to those who obey me ...
i promise a life without fear of the forest poisons or the insects !
wait !
you must not raise a hand against the wastelands !
who is this old crone ?
hey !
take here away !
let her speak .
in the thousand years since the birth of the wastelands ,
humans have frequently attempted to burn down the poisonous forests .
but every time , a herd of ohmu , maddened with anger , ... converged to become a giant wave that covered the land and came as a flood ,
destroying countries , swallowing up cities ...
the ohmu continued to run until their own lives ran out .
in due time , using ohmu' s corpses as the seed beds , the spores dropped their roots ... ... and more lands were swallowed into the wastelands .
you must not touch the wastelands .
shut up !
i won' t allow such raving !
well , what will you do ?
kill me ?
wh why you !
go ahead , kill me !
i' m a blind old woman .
it' s simple !
like the way you killed jhil .
lord jhil ? !
what did she say ?
lord jhil was ill !
murderers !
murderers !
silence them !
don' t be easy on those who defy .
everyone , wait !
please listen to me .
i don' t want any more bloodshed .
please .
please understand as well , grandmother .
let' s obey these people .
it' s a pretty nice valley , don' t you think ?
i' m opposed to this .
our orders are to transport the god warrior back home as soon as possible .
the order cannot be carried out .
our largest ship couldn' t bear the weight of that thing ; it crashed .
but , you can' t seriously want to establish a state here ?
and what if i am ?
are you saying we should make that monster the play thing of those fools back home ?
well , i could understand that , but ...
i am no more than a simple soldier .
i would be overstepping my authority in such a decision .
hmph !
fox .
i will return to pejite .
in my absence , put all your efforts into reviving the god warrior .
yes , ma' am !
can we take this gunship ?
yes , spoils of war .
don' t mistake me .
i am not consulting you .
but , taking the princess to pejite ...
five hostages , the gunship , and goods , you say ?
i' il leave the selection of the hostages up to you .
complete preparations for departure by tomorrow morning .
thanks for being the hostages .
never mind us .
look they intend to take everything .
i will leave this place for the time being .
i' il return secretly and wait for an opportunity .
we must stop the revival of that monster at all costs .
nausicaa ?
teto , where is your mistress ?
nausicaa .
what is the meaning of this ?
these are plants from the wasteland .
i gathered the spores and grew them .
it' s all right .
they' re not giving off any vapor .
not giving off poison ? !
although the air in here is certainly pure .
why ?
even this venomous hisokusari plant has flowered .
the water here is brought up from 500 meters underground by the castle' s giant windmill .
i gathered the sand from\ the bottom of the same well .
with clean water and soil i' ve found out that the wasteland' s plants don' t emit poison .
it' s the soil that' s polluted .
even the soil of this valley is polluted .
why ?
who could have done this to the world ?
you found that out all by yourself ?
yes .
i wanted to cure father' s and everyone' s illness .
but , i' il close this place soon .
i stopped the water a little while ago , so everything should soon wither away .
nausicaa
i i' m afraid of myself .
i lost my temper and killed in spite .
i don' t know what i will do .
i don' t want to kill anyone else .
princess !
we' ve gathered these chico nuts .
we give them to you , princess !
everyone ...
so many ...
it must have been hard .
thank you .
i' il eat them with care .
poor princess .
hurry it up !
we' re leaving .
come on , everyone .
don' t cry any more .
it' s ok .
i' il come right back .
really ?
oh !
have i ever lied to you ?
no .
have i ?
no .
see ?
now go , it will be dangerous here .
promise !
take care of the princess !
take care of the rest !
are we in pejite yet ?
my butt is killing me .
my , my ....
the princess has chosen hostages that won' t be missed .
say , don' t you think this is strange ?
why are they in such a tight formation ?
it' s as if they' re afraid of an attack .
there' s a huge storm of vapors under the clouds .
don' t move .
gunship !
enemy attack !
ship number 2 , destroyed !
like i said !
how frightening !
perimeter defense !
it' s a pejite gunship !
pejite ?
damn ship number 3 , destroyed as well !
what is the corvette doing ?
what a fragile ship .
the rear guard was caught up in it !
the barge' s wire !
teto , hurry !
it' s no use , this one' il fall , too !
princess !
stop !
don' t kill any more !
stop !
princess !
hurry , mito !
princess it' s no use !
we might be able to fly it !
what ?
mito !
hurry !
coming !
engine , start !
we' il blast the door with the gun !
right !
come on !
quickly !
quickly , get inside !
mito , ready ?
somehow !
engine full .
same time as the gun blast !
roger !
ready !
flre !
put on the masks !
we' il descend below the clouds and rescue the barge !
still warm .
please don' t die , teto !
what a world down there .
i' ve never seen such dense a vapor before .
rear seat , watch to the right !
it' s near .
it' s still flying !
it' s true !
it really is there !
it' s the princess !
princess !
everyone !
hang on !
i' il extend the tow rope .
the hook is broken .
aerial retrieval is impossible !
i don' t want to land and be eaten by the bugs !
i' il just die without any more ado !
calm down !
dump the cargo !
fare thee well !
do as i say !
dump the cargo !
rear seat !
cut the engine !
what ?
the engine noise is a hindrance .
hurry !
p princess !
w what
princess , your mask !
you' il die !
put on your mask !
everybody !
i' il save you for certain .
trust me .
dump the cargo !
we' il do anything !
just , please , put back your mask !
the princess is smiling .
we' re going to be saved .
hurry !
the bow is falling !
ignite the engine !
we' il look for a place to land .
a little got in my lungs .
princess !
is everyone ok ?
don' t move !
you
thanks for all your help .
princess !
why save such a
you' re far too trusting .
did you think i would get on my knees and thank you ?
you don' t understand anything about the wastelands .
this is not a human world .
you can' t know what will happen if you use that gun in this place .
in the battle a little while ago ... ... many ships fell into the forest .
the insects are angry .
look , above .
the royal yanma are the forest sentinel .
they will summon other insects soon .
we must escape at once !
fetch the spare rope !
mito , repair the hook !
don' t move !
i' il give the orders !
what are you frightened of ?
you' re like a little lost fox squirrel .
what !
don' t be afraid .
don' t be frightened .
i just want you to return to your own country .
they' ve come !
quiet !
don' t anger them .
this is an ohmu' s nest !
w we' re surrounded !
they' re looking us over .
ohmu !
i' m sorry !
forgive us for disturbing your nest .
but , please understand !
we' re not your enemies .
p princess !
that one is alive ?
wait !
ohmu !
what' s going on ?
the ohmu' s eyes are bright red .
princess what do you think you' re doing with mehve ?
when the water calms down , take off at once and wait up in the air .
if i' m not back in one hour , return to the valley !
but princess !
