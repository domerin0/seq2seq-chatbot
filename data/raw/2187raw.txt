okay , you ready for this ?
as ever .
let' s do it .
let' s play who wants to be a millionaire ?
who wrote the phrase " no man is an island " ?
john donne ?
john milton ?
john f. kennedy ?
jon bon jovi ?
jon bon jovi .
too easy .
and , if i may say so , a complete load of bollocks .
in my opinion , all men are islands .
and what' s more , now' s the time to be one .
this is an island age .
a hundred years ago , you had to depend on other people .
no one had tv or cds or dvds or videos ... ... or home espresso makers .
actually , they didn' t have anything cool .
whereas now , you see ... ... you can make yourself a little island paradise .
with the right supplies and the right attitude ... ... you can be sun drenched , tropical , a magnet ... ... for young swedish tourists .
hi , it' s kristina .
i haven' t heard from you .
i had a great time last weekend .
so give me a call , okay ?
' bye .
and i like to think that perhaps i am that kind of island .
i like to think i' m pretty cool .
i like to think i' m ibiza .
there were people who had a good time in life .
i was beginning to realize i wasn' t one of them .
i just didn' t fit .
i didn' t fit at my old school .
i definitely didn' t fit at my new one .
i heard that some kids got taught by their parents at home .
mum couldn' t do that , unless i paid her to teach me .
because it was just her and me .
and she went to work .
she made400 a week .
where was i gonna get that kind of money from ?
maybe if i was like that movie kid , haley joel osment ... ... i could pay her that much .
but if that meant being good at drama , forget it .
i was crap at drama .
' cause i hated standing up in front of people .
so , basically , i had to go to school .
the sad fact is that , like any island dweller ... ... from time to time i had to visit the mainland .
this is lmogene .
you can hold her if you like .
that' s ....
well , okay .
yeah .
got her .
lovely .
yeah , she' s delightful , isn' t she ?
i know .
isn' t she ?
to tell the truth , i' m being crap with her .
you better take her back .
she could' ve been yours if you got your act together .
just think of that , yeah .
so , the place is looking really nice .
barney , barney , barney .
say hello to will , barney .
here we go .
it' s the antichrist .
hello , barney .
how are you ?
he' s lovely .
yeah .
and what about you , will ?
any desire for a family of your own yet ?
i' d rather eat barney' s nappies .
not really .
i' m sort of all right as i am .
please , will .
what does that mean ?
please " what ?
look at yourself .
you' re 38 and you' ve never had a job ... ... or a relationship that lasted longer than two months .
i wouldn' t exactly say you were okay .
i mean , i would say you were a disaster .
i mean , what is the point of your life ?
bloody hell .
you' re right .
there' s probably no point to my life ... ... but thank you for bringing it up .
the reason we wanted you to come here today was we wanted to ask you ... ... how would you like to be lmogene' s godfather ?
seriously ?
seriously .
listen , i' m really , really touched .
but you must be joking .
i couldn' t possibly think of a worse godfather for imogene .
you know me .
i' il drop her at her christening .
i' il forget her birthdays until her 18th , when i' il take her out and get her drunk ... ... and possibly , let' s face it , you know , try and shag her .
i mean , seriously , it' s a very , very bad choice .
we know , i just thought you had hidden depths .
no .
no .
you' ve always had that wrong .
i really am this shallow .
here we are .
you know you don' t have to walk me to school anymore now , mum .
i know the way now .
but what if i like walking you to school ?
right .
who are you ?
i' m me .
and what are you not ?
a sheep .
right .
and what does a sheep go ?
marcus ?
i love you .
look .
i love you , too .
i love you , marcus !
love you !
look at him !
while i couldn' t accept the offer ... ... to become their child' s godfather ... ... i did allow them to set me up with angie , a rather beautiful coworker of christine' s .
they had , however , being them , neglected to tell me one thing .
there' s something you don' t know about me .
yeah ?
something exciting ?
i think so , yes .
i have a 3 year old boy .
i wanted to throw the napkin on the floor , push over the table and run .
brilliant .
i love kids .
yeah .
i like messing about with them .
doing kid things .
i' d have been disappointed if you didn' t have a child .
why do you say that ?
god knows .
mainly because it sounded smooth and winning .
because i love kids so much .
they' re so lovely .
what in god' s name are you saying , you idiot ?
she can' t be buying this rubbish .
but she did buy my rubbish .
and for the next few weeks i was suddenly will the good guy .
her kid took to me , mainly because on our first meeting ... ... i took him to the zoo and held him upside down by his ankles .
i wish relationships with proper humans were that easy .
you know , you are brilliant .
i came to realize that with single mums ... ... particularly ones who' d been badly treated ... ... and eventually abandoned by the father of their children , you became by comparison ....
you are a wonderful person .
no , i' m not .
but it was hard to be wonderful all the time .
eventually i began to wonder whether angie was exactly what i was looking for .
for instance , she was late for the new imax movie because the babysitter hadn' t turned up .
i' m so sorry .
it' s all right .
that pissed me off .
you okay ?
yes .
and there were deeper problems .
she couldn' t stay at my place , and she didn' t have a dvd , or satellite or cable .
so we were always stuck watching some crap made for tv movie about a kid with leukemia .
i' m afraid there' s nothing we can do .
godl nol please , please , nol
i was going to have to end it .
but having been will the good guy ... ... i didn' t relish going back to my role of will the unreliable , emotionally stunted asshole .
i' m sorry ?
you' re breaking up with me ?
you ... ... self centered bastard .
i can' t believe i' ve wasted all this time with you !
you useless , superficial loser .
will ....
then something magical happened .
i' m sorry .
i' m not sure this is working out .
it' s not you .
you' ve been great .
it' s me .
well , my situation with louie and his dad .
i' m not ready to launch into a relationship with anybody new .
yeah .
i' m so sorry .
i think i understand .
you' re a wonderful man , will .
i' d never watched a woman cry without feeling responsible before .
she even wanted me to forgive her .
it felt amazing .
listen , you don' t have anything to feel sorry about .
really .
so that was the end of angie , but the beginning of a whole new thing .
single mums .
why hadn' t anyone told me about them before ?
passionate sex , a lot of ego massage and a guilt free parting .
there must be thousands , just waiting for a nice guy to sleep with and break up with .
fabulous , sexy , gorgeous single mums .
can i have cocoa puffs ?
no , it' s not sunday .
the crying had started again .
and it scared me ... ... ' cause now it was in the mornings .
she' d never done that before .
i couldn' t figure it out .
nobody was dead .
she had a job as a music therapist , which is kind of a teacher for sick kids .
so there was enough money for food and everything .
should i get my own breakfast ?
no , i' m doing it .
so , you looking forward to school today ?
today , you' il need to effect ... ... the decimal point when you multiply it by 10 ... ... 100 and 1000 .
nothing to do but frown
rainy days and mondays always get me down
thank you very much , marcus .
hi , nicky .
hi , mark .
are you going to computer club later ?
i don' t know .
marcus ....
madonna !
go on , give us a song !
you' d like that , wouldn' t you ?
spice girls or something .
three of them .
yeah .
hey , spice girls .
you made me lose my football .
marcus , we don' t really want you hanging around with us anymore .
why not ?
well , it' s because of them .
they' ve got nothing to do with me .
yes , they do .
we never had trouble with them before we started hanging out with you .
now we get it every single day .
besides , everyone thinks you' re weird .
only a bit , though .
okay .
' bye .
there you have it .
i was having a shit time at home and a shit time at school .
it was fine deciding single mums were the future ... ... but the frustrating truth was i didn' t have their numbers .
hi , dad .
hey .
where did they hang out ?
i' m a single father , i have a 2 year old boy .
i' m a single father , i have a 2 year old boy .
i' m a single father , i have a 2 year old boy .
i' m a single father , i have a 2 year old boy .
spat .
this was exciting .
a potential gold mine of single mums .
i could see the beautiful creatures now , getting roaring drunk ... ... forgetting their troubles , ready to rock and roll .
that was when i was 7 months pregnant .
by the time i had the baby , he was in majorca with another woman .
not even the one he cheated on me with the first time .
well , with me , it was the week before the birth .
he said i' d got too fat .
mine was shagging his secretary .
such a cliche .
men are bastards .
after about 10 minutes ... ... i wanted to cut my own penis off with a kitchen knife .
me .
yes .
i have a 2 year old .
ned .
he' s got blue eyes and sort of sandy colored hair ... ... and he' s about 2' 3 " .
and his mum left .
really ?
yeah .
yeah , i mean , obviously it was a very big shock ... ... because we were so happy , you know ?
sandra' s neurology practice was just up and running ... ... and then one day her bags were packed , and my best friend was waiting outside ... ... in his ferrari .
yeah .
you know , the modena ?
the one with the supercharged engine , where you can see it through the back window ?
you got dumped then ?
yeah .
may i ask , does your ex see ned at all ?
sorry , i didn' t catch your name .
suzie .
suzie .
she doesn' t see much of him , no .
how does he cope with that ?
he' s a very good little boy .
very , very brave .
they' ve got amazing resources , don' t they ?
just the other day i was thinking about my ex .
you hang in there , dad .
god , that' s amazing for a 2 year old !
is it ?
yeah , he' s very special .
very , very special .
sometimes i think , you know , he' s the one taking care of me .
teaching me the ways of the world .
sorry .
thank you .
my god , what a performancel i was even fooling myself .
there you go .
you okay ?
yeah .
perfect , thanks .
trust me ?
of course .
by the end of the evening , i had a date lined up .
single parents alone together !
single parents alone togetherl all for one and one for alil
the problem was i also had an imaginary 2 year old son .
the date was a spat picnic in regent' s park , with everyone bringing their kids .
sadly , ned couldn' t be there .
his mum had come and picked him up at the last second .
what a shame .
yeah .
i' m sorry .
got it .
this is megan , by the way .
hello , megan .
yeah .
a friend of mine from spat isn' t feeling so great ... ... so i said that we' d take her kid to the picnic , too .
ls that all right ?
yeah .
the more the merrier .
right .
come on , slowcoach !
i hated that spatlot .
mum' s friend suzie was fine , but now there was that wally who wanted to get off with her .
marcus , will .
will , marcus .
hi there .
right .
pile in , everyone .
look what a mess ned made of the car seat .
what a shame he can' t come .
so , what do you do ?
me ?
there were too many lies to keep track of so i told the truth .
nothing .
well , before then .
what do you mean , before i did nothing ?
yeah .
i did nothing .
you' ve never worked ?
i' ve done the odd day here and there , but , no .
crazy , isn' t it ?
it' s ....
brilliant .
my god , i was going to have to tell her .
what happened , in fact , was that my dad wrote a song ... ... in 1958 , and it' s quite a famous song ... ... and i basically live off the royalties of that .
you know michael jackson ?
he makes a 1, 000, 000 a minute .
that' s 60, 000, 000 an hour .
i don' t make a1, 000, 000 a minute .
nothing like , sadly .
how much then ?
marcus !
i was beginning to wonder if we' d be stuck with this weird kid all day .
so , what' s this song then ?
if you can live off it , we must' ve heard of it .
it' s santa' s super sleigh .
god , please don' t sing it .
look who' s coming round the bend it' s santa and his reindeer friends
with a ho , ho , ho and a hey , hey , hey , it' s santa' s super sleigh
i expect people do that all the time .
no , i think you two are the first .
sorry .
i don' t understand .
how does that make you money ?
do carol singers have to pay you 10 percent ?
they should , but you can' t always catch the little bastards .
so , how often do you look after him ?
marcus .
every once in a while .
his mum' s a little off color sometimes .
you call it off color , i call it nuts .
she' s not nuts , marcus .
she just needs a weekend taking it easy .
we' il have a nice picnic , and when you get home , she' il be all rested up .
my god !
what the hell is that ?
my mum' s homemade bread .
it looks pretty good .
no , it isn' t .
it' s healthy .
you miss him , don' t you ?
who ?
ned !
yeah .
yeah , very much .
he' d have loved this .
i think i killed a duck .
i was only trying to feed it .
what' s that floating in the water next to it ?
is that your mum' s bread ?
you didn' t have to throw the whole loaf .
that would' ve killed me .
you the one who was throwing bloody great loaves at the ducks ?
yeah , he was , but i' ve stopped him now .
you know , boys will be boys , and all that .
so he killed it .
no .
sorry , i misunderstood you .
the duck was dead already .
he was throwing bread to try and sink the body ... ... because megan here was getting upset .
marcus wouldn' t kill a duck .
would you , marcus ?
no .
i love ducks .
they' re my second favorite animal after dolphins .
they can kill sharks with their noses .
i' il have to wade in and get it .
listen , i hope it' s not some sort of epidemic .
i think we beat the rap there , mate .
yeah .
well .
marcus ?
mum .
that day , the dead duck day , was when it all began .
that bloke will just followed us in and i didn' t tell him not to .
afterwards , i realized that there was no way i could have been nervous just then ... ... because just then i didn' t know there was anything to be nervous about .
but then i put the key in the lock , opened the door ....
are you decent ?
and a new part of my life started .
bangl
jesus christ .
oh , my god .
will , call an ambulance .
marcus , where' s the phone ?
where' s the phone , mate ?
it was horrible .
horrible .
but driving fast behind the ambulance was fantastic .
she' s conscious .
she was okay in the ambulance .
she was asking after you , marcus .
that' s nice of her .
listen , you know this has nothing to do with you , don' t you ?
i mean , you' re not the reason that she ....
you' re not the reason that she' s here .
isn' t that right , will ?
yeah , that' s right .
i' il go get you some water .
i can get that .
no , you' re okay .
your mum' s going to be okay .
yeah , i suppose .
that' s not the point , though , is it ?
right , you mean you' re afraid she might try again ?
just shut up , all right ?
there you go , warm and flat .
are you with fiona brewer ?
yes , i' m her friend suzie .
this is marcus and will .
she' s recovering well , but we' il keep her overnight .
i' m going to get a consent form for ms. brewer so the boy can stay with you two tonight .
right .
so , my place or yours ?
sorry .
okay .
i should get back to ned , i think .
i' il take that .
all right .
all in all , this was very interesting .
so i' il call .
but i wouldn' t want to do it every night .
see you soon .
the thing is , a person' s life is like a tv show .
i was the star of the will show .
and the will show wasn' t an ensemble drama .
guests came and went , but i was the regular .
it came down to me , and me alone .
if marcus ' mum couldn' t manage her own show ... ... if her ratings were falling , it was sad , but that was her problem .
ultimately , the whole single mum plot line was a bit complicated for me .
i got the letter .
thanks .
oh , my god .
i' d forgotten .
you forgot ?
you forgot a suicide letter ?
i didn' t think i' d have to remember it , did i ?
did you read the part where i said i' d always love you ?
it' s a bit hard for you to love me when you' re dead , isn' t it ?
i' m sorry .
i can understand why you' re angry , marcus .
i don' t feel the same as i did yesterday , if that' s any help .
what ?
it' s all just gone away ?
all that ?
no , but ... ... at the moment , i feel better .
at the moment " is no good to me .
i can see you feel better at the moment .
you just put the kettle on .
but what happens when you finish your tea ?
what happens when i go back to school ?
i can' t be here to watch you all the time .
i know .
we have to look after each other .
the two of us .
suddenly i realized two people isn' t enough .
you need a backup .
if you' re only two people , and someone drops off the edge ... ... then you' re on your own .
two isn' t a large enough number .
you need three , at least .
three what ?
nothing .
but i' d had a great idea .
the important thing in island living is to be your own activities director .
i find the key is to think of a day as units of time ... ... each unit consisting of no more than 30 minutes .
full hours can be a little bit intimidating ... ... and most activities take about half an hour .
one unit .
okay ....
one unit .
two units .
three units .
four units .
it' s amazing how the day fills up .
i often wonder , to be absolutely honest ... ... if i' d ever really have time for a job .
how do people cram them in ?
yeah , will here .
it' s marcus .
pardon ?
it' s marcus .
marcus ?
marcus .
hi .
how' d you get my number ?
from suzie .
i thought you' d like to take me out for the day on saturday .
and why did you think that , marcus ?
suzie said we hit it off .
did she ?
yeah .
and you said , " see you soon .
i said what ?
see you soon .
the night you dropped us off .
remember ?
you said , " see you soon .
this is soon , all right , marcus .
the thing is , mate , my life is kind of hectic at the moment .
why ?
i thought you did nothing .
i' ve got ned and stuff to look after .
matter of fact , i should be on the way to preschool right now .
what' s that noise ?
that' s a lawn mower .
so , you know , just time wise it' s not ....
tell you what , just hold the line one sec .
hold on , one sec .
thanks .
but then i thought , " why not ?
why shouldn' t i take the poor little sod out for a meal ?
i could be uncle will .
cool uncle will , king of the kids .
okay , marcus .
you' re on .
i' il come if you take my mum , too .
she has no money , so we' il have to go somewhere cheap or you' il have to treat us .
listen , don' t beat about the bush , marcus .
why should i ?
we' re poor .
you' re rich .
you pay .
bring your little boy , i don' t mind .
that' s really big of you .
fine .
come round at 12 : 30 or something .
remember where we live ?
flat 2 , 31 craysfield road , islington , london , n12sf .
england , the world , the universe .
yeah .
marcus ?
so , fiona , how are you ?
i mean , how are you feeling ?
my stomach' s fine .
great .
i must still be a bit barmy , though .
this kind of thing doesn' t go away overnight , does it ?
no .
if mum was going to get will to marry her , she' d have to quit making jokes .
at least she looked good .
i had her put on that nice hairy jumper ... ... and the earrings she got from her friend that went to zimbabwe .
the kid seemed to think this was a date .
as for his mum , she was clearly insane ... ... and appeared to be wearing some kind of yeti costume .
this had better be quick .
we were definitely not ordering starters .
i' il start with the artichoke , please .
then i' il have a mushroom omelet with fries and a coke .
i' il have the vegetable platter .
we' re vegetarians .
i' d never have guessed .
steak sandwich , please , mate .
thanks .
this was going really well .
i wondered if we were going to move into will' s place or move into someplace new .
i heard he sang a good song
i heard he had a style
i knew , of course , the song couldn' t last forever ... ... that i' d soon be at home , tucked up in bed .
i knew it , but i couldn' t feel it .
and there he was , this young boy
i must' ve been insane .
all i' d wanted was a date with suzie .
this was my punishment .
strumming my pain with his fingers
the worst part was when they closed their eyes .
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly
come sing with us , will .
i should really get going .
thanks .
that' s the problem with charity .
you must mean it .
you have to mean things to help people .
like the time i volunteered to help out at a soup kitchen ... ... and very nearly made it .
or the time at amnesty international .
did you know in burma you get seven years in prison for telling jokes ?
next time you laugh , think of pa pa lay , the burmese standup comedian .
we' re at a crucial stage in our struggle for human rights ... ... which have been grossly abused by the ruling junta .
we need your support more than ever .
together we can make a difference ....
you' re kidding .
and what' s your boyfriend say about that ?
wait a minute .
you say you haven' t got a boyfriend ?
talk about human rights violations .
is that right ?
you' re in the bath now ?
you have to mean things to help people .
fiona meant killing me softly .
killing me softly meant something to her and look where she ended up .
me , i didn' t mean anything , about anything , to anyone .
i knew that guaranteed me a long , depression free life .
yet over the next few days , i did have a strange feeling .
like a presence lurking at the back of my mind .
and i didn' t like it .
you don' t have a kid , do you ?
what ?
you don' t have a kid , do you ?
of course i do !
what are you on about ?
no , you don' t .
i' ve been watching you , and you don' t have a kid .
what is it to you , anyway ?
nothing .
except you' ve been lying to me , my mum and my mum' s friend .
can i come in ?
no .
why ?
' cause i' m busy .
what are you doing ?
i' m watching tv .
i could watch it with you , if you like .
that' s very nice of you ... ... but i usually manage on my own , thanks .
don' t you have homework to do , or something ?
want to help ?
no , that' s not what i meant .
i meant , why don' t you go home and do your homework ?
i' il do you a deal .
i won' t tell anyone you don' t have a kid if you go out with my mum .
you' d want your mum to go out with someone like me ?
you' re not too bad .
i mean , you told lies , but apart from that you seem okay .
and she' s sad .
i think she' d like a boyfriend .
i can' t just go out with someone ... ... because you want me to .
i' d have to like the person , as well .
what' s wrong with her ?
nothing' s wrong with her , it' s just the system .
that' s how it ....
i' m not talking about this with you .
just go .
okay .
but i' il be back .
i' m really scared !
that' s the best i could come up with , " i' m scared .
but as a matter of fact , i was .
okay , that' s it .
tim , goodbye .
jill , goodbye .
carol , goodbye .
goodbye .
and from me , arrivederci .
bye bye .
thanks .
see you .
hello , everybody .
welcome to the game of countdown .
you remember yesterday , carol , i revealed to a grateful nation ... ... that our guest , tom o' connell
yes .
he , like all of us , changes for each show .
but he is such a
is that right ?
yeah .
another term for hosta , i think .
yes , well .
named after heinrich christian funck , who also invented disco dancing .
yes .
i' ve got all his audios .
mum , did you always know i was going to be a vegetarian ?
yeah , of course i did .
i didn' t decide on the spur of the moment ' cause we ran out of sausages .
did you ask me if i wanted to be a vegetarian ?
what , when you were born ?
i do the cooking and i don' t want to cook meat .
you have to eat what i eat .
but you don' t let me go to mcdonald' s , either .
is this premature teenage rebellion ?
i can' t stop you from going to mcdonald' s .
i' d just be disappointed if you did .
don' t worry , mum .
i won' t go to mcdonald' s .
after a few visits , will seemed to think he had to ask me serious questions .
but i knew he really wanted to watch warrior princess .
so , how' s it going at home then ?
you mean my mum ?
yeah .
she' s all right , thanks .
i mean , you know , she' s ....
yeah , i know .
no , nothing like that .
does it still bother you , then ?
does it bother me ?
are you decent ?
every single day .
that' s why i come here , instead of going home .
a bit .
when i think about it .
fucking hell .
i don' t know why he swore like that , but it made me feel better .
it made me feel like i wasn' t being pathetic to get so scared .
i wouldn' t make the mistake of asking about fiona again .
marcus was clearly screwed up about it ... ... and unfortunately i couldn' t think of anything to say that' d be of any value .
next time he could talk to suzie , or a counselor ... ... or anybody capable of something more than an obscenity .
shit !
it can' t be .
november the sodding 19 .
six weeks before christmas and already they were playing the bloody thing .
dad ?
what was your dad like ?
a bit sad , really .
you know , he wrote one crap song that turned out to be a massive hit ... ... and then spent the rest of his life trying to write a better one .
do you ever want to write songs like him ?
is that what the guitar' s for ?
no .
so , that' s just there to look cool .
yeah .
i like santa' s super sleigh .
madonna !
come here !
we' ve got something .
he' s getting away , look !
hurry up !
on pet rescue today , the clever stoat keeps everyone ... ... on their toes in somerset .
hey !
what are you doing ?
who are you ?
who am i ?
bugger off , that' s who i am !
go on , piss off !
who were they , then ?
who ?
what do you mean , " who ?
the ones trying to embed sweets into your skull .
oh , them .
they' re just a couple of older kids .
they started following me after school .
does this happen often ?
they never chucked sweets before , they just thought of that .
i' m not talking about the sweets .
the kids trying to kill you .
yeah , they give me a hard time .
you know , about my hair , and my clothes and singing and stuff .
and what ?
and singing ?
sometimes i sing out loud without noticing .
that' s not a brilliant idea , is it ?
i said i did it without noticing , didn' t i ?
it just happens !
i' m not going to do it on purpose , am i ?
i' m not stupid , you know .
my advice is to keep out of people' s way .
try to make yourself invisible .
how can i be invisible ?
one machine in your kitchen is an invisible machine ?
i don' t think so .
i just try not to think of it , that' s all .
it happens , and i wish it didn' t , but that' s life , isn' t it ?
there' s nothing i can do about it .
no .
there is something we can do about it , marcus .
you' re coming with me .
i was worried he was going to take me to the headmistress ' office .
but instead he took me shopping .
i don' t get it .
we' re starting with your feet .
i can' t make you invisible , but i can make you blend in with the crowd .
i don' t know how to tie them .
they' ve got these funny strappy things .
it' s called velcro .
it' s a revolutionary new technology .
for christ' s sake .
it' s not hard .
all right , wait a minute , it is a bit hard .
everything all right ?
yeah , thanks .
pretty trendy , your old man , isn' t he ?
there .
you think you look cool , don' t you ?
don' t know .
do you think i look cool ?
yeah , marcus .
i think you look cool .
yeah .
that' s it , you got the walk .
that' s really cool .
brilliant .
high five .
yeah .
i was suddenly hit by an extraordinary rush of well being .
so this is what people meant by a natural high .
and it only cost60 .
i had made an unhappy boy temporarily happy .
and there wasn' t anything in it for me at all .
i didn' t even want to shag his mum .
marcus !
what happened to your shoes ?
they stole them .
why would anyone want to steal your shoes ?
i could see i had to tell the truth .
the problem was , the truth would lead to a lot more questions .
they were nice ones .
they were just ordinary brown lace ups .
no , they weren' t .
they were cool new trainers .
where did you get cool new trainers ?
she had loads more questions .
will bought them for me .
will ?
the guy who took us to lunch ?
yeah .
he' s sort of become my friend .
he' s sort of become your friend ?
she kept repeating the last thing i said .
except she shouted it .
i go round to his place after school .
you go round to his place after school !
you see , he doesn' t really have a kid .
he doesn' t really have a kid ?
can i play computer games now ?
where does he live ?
he' s not there at the moment .
he' s out to dinner .
christine had asked me to dinner for a pep talk .
you will end up childless and alone .
both fingers crossed , yeah .
you must have a lot of courage .
why is that , christine ?
most people need something in their lives to keep them afloat ... ... and you have absolutely nothing .
doesn' t that scare you ?
do you know what you want ?
yes , i do .
i' il have the steak
what the hell are these little after school tea parties about ?
hi .
sorry ?
what did you say ?
i was just wondering why a single , childless man would want to hang out ... ... with a 12 year old boy every day ?
you didn' t tell your mum that you' ve been coming round ?
i think i forgot .
tell me what ?
what are you doing with my son ?
wait a minute .
what are you suggesting here ?
i' m not suggesting anything .
i think you are .
you were suggesting that i' ve been interfering with your son .
i' m simply asking you why you entertain 12 year olds in your flat .
my god !
oh , my god !
what do you have to say for yourself ?
well ?
don' t " well " me !
don' t " well " me about this !
he comes over uninvited every night !
do you know why ?
he' s having the shit bullied out of him at school !
and you haven' t got a clue .
you send him out like a lamb to the slaughter !
he' s been taken to pieces every day of the week , you daft , fucking hippie !
i think you' re being a bit melodramatic .
marcus is fine .
strange .
will had it right , mum didn' t .
it should be the other way around .
you haven' t had much contact with kids .
i used to be a bloody kid !
i went to a bloody school .
i know when kids can' t settle down and when kids are miserable !
look at him , for christ' s sake !
don' t accuse me of being melodramatic .
this coming from a woman who tried to  cowabunga !
what' s the matter with you ?
nothing .
i just felt like a shout .
jesus , what a family .
will , you' re disturbing the other customers .
it' s fine .
i' m sorry .
i' m done .
okay , so , you' re not ....
what ?
no , i' m not !
no , i' m not .
listen , don' t worry about it .
i won' t open the door to marcus again , okay ?
i' il be glad to be rid of the pair of you , frankly .
go on .
bugger off .
sorry .
so that' s it , is it ?
you' re just out of his life , like that .
excuse me ?
let' s say you' re right and i' m wrong .
let' s say there' s this whole world ... ... that i don' t understand , and somehow , miraculously , you do .
what are you going to do about it ?
i' m not going to do anything .
he' s none of my business .
you' re a selfish bastard .
that' s what i tell him .
he always puts himself first .
but i' m on my own .
it' s just me .
i' m not putting myself first .
there' s nobody else .
yes , there is !
there' s marcus .
you' re involved now .
he keeps coming around your bloody house .
you' ve come into his life for a reason .
you can' t just shut him out .
you can' t shut life out .
no man is an island .
she' s right , you know .
yeah , she is .
no , she' s not !
she' s wrong !
some men are islands .
i' m a bloody island !
i' m bloody lbiza !
what are you talking about ?
do you want to come over for christmas ?
no , marcus , i do not want to come over for bloody christmas .
i do not want to spend christmas with miss granola suicide and her spawn .
i' d always thought what you did with christmas ... ... was sort of a statement about where you stood in life .
i was going to spend this christmas the way i usually did .
watching videos and getting drunk and stoned .
before you came , i was all alone .
it is bad to be alone .
alone , bad .
friend , good .
friend , goodl
now come here .
the good news was it wasn' t just me and fiona and marcus .
the bad news was , well ....
so , you' re marcus ' dad .
yeah , i guess so .
and this is my girlfriend , lindsey .
and lindsey' s mum .
hi there .
thanks , dad .
that' s okay .
i had to hand it to the kid .
he could be enthusiastic about some truly crap present .
wow , a tambourine !
thanks , mum .
isn' t that cool , will ?
yeah , that' il come in handy .
i saw it and i thought , " this' il be perfect .
maybe you can perform at that school concert .
get a pop group together .
make some friends .
maybe , mum .
when you sing , it brings sunshine and happiness into my heart .
thanks , mum .
this one' s from me .
brilliant !
what is it ?
it' s a cd , marcus .
by mystikal .
they' re cool .
you' il like them .
and what kind of music is mystikal ?
it' s sort of world music .
shake ya ass .
slash rap type thing .
shake ya ass ?
is he moroccan ?
i' m afraid we haven' t got a cd player .
it' s great anyway .
i know you haven' t got a cd player , so , i got you one of them as well .
what a lucky boy .
look , mum .
open yours , will .
all right .
thanks a lot .
marcus , is this a joke ?
yeah .
it' s not bad .
hi .
sorry , i' m dead late !
have i missed anything ?
no , come on in .
merry christmas .
merry christmas !
hey !
long time no see .
where' s megan ?
at her dad' s .
where' s ned ?
at his mum' s for christmas ?
yeah .
no .
i should probably go , shouldn' t i ?
you could go pose as santa , try and shag some carol singers .
are you a professional santa ?
how lovely !
right .
that' s it .
i' m off .
thank you very much .
it was great .
suzie has every right to express her anger .
yes , and she' s expressed it .
now i have a right to bugger off .
thanks a lot .
' bye .
wait !
he' s my friend .
i invited him .
i should be able to tell him when to go home .
i haven' t told will to go , marcus .
suzie' s angry and has every right to be , and she' s telling him so .
she' s right , marcus .
just leave it , okay ?
all he did was make up a kid for a couple weeks .
god , that' s nothing .
so what ?
who cares ?
kids at school do worse than that every day !
the point is , marcus , will left school a long time ago .
he should' ve grown out of making people up by now .
that' s for sure .
it' s not fair to gang up on him .
he' s been better behaved since then .
he bought me trainers , he lets me go round to his house and he knows what kids need .
what ?
expensive footwear and obscene music ?
if there' s something you really need then we can talk about it .
no , we can' t .
it' s not a discussion , it' s an argument , and you always win .
why not just tell me what to do ?
i want you to think for yourself !
i' m thinking for myself !
and i want will to stay !
he' s not the only one who ever did anything wrong !
remember how we met ?
remember why ?
because you
because you threw a loaf of bread at a duck' s head and killed it , basically .
excuse me ?
what' s this about a duck ?
are we having duck ?
delicious !
of course we were not having duck .
instead we had nut loaf with parsnip gravy .
as i sat there , i had a strange feeling .
i was enjoying myself .
i' d never really enjoyed christmas before .
my mother used to make me sing santa' s super sleigh ... ... in front of my inebriated uncles and aunts ... ... just to get at my dad , i think .
but christmas at marcus ' , i' m ashamed to say it , gave me ... ... a warm , fuzzy feeling .
i held that feeling responsible for the strange events that followed .
first of all , marcus got a crush on a girl .
hello .
piss off .
and then , even stranger , so did i.
it was all marcus ' fault , really ... ... because once you open your door to one person , anyone can come in .
on new year' s eve , i met rachel .
she was interesting , smart and attractive .
and for about five minutes , i had her convinced that i was , too . ... things like political events .
okay .
you in television ?
am i in television ?
no .
everyone else is in television .
yeah .
i watch television .
right , right .
so you' re more in front of it than in it .
ln it , yeah .
yes , i get it , yeah .
it was torture .
for five minutes i realized what life would be like if i were , in any way , interesting .
if i had anything to say for myself , if i did anything .
but i didn' t do anything .
and in about 30 seconds she' d know and she' d be gone like a shot .
so what do you do ?
i' m sort of taking a bit of time off at the moment .
sounds good , yeah .
yeah .
time off from what ?
to be absolutely honest , time off from time off , in fact .
the interesting thing about me is i don' t actually do anything .
you don' t do anything ?
actually , no .
nothing .
nope .
wow .
that' s ....
now , rachel , darling .
east coast or west coast rap ?
i have absolutely no ....
there .
she was gone .
there was no more to say .
all rap music sounds exactly the same to me .
or was there ?
i tell you what .
i know a 12 year old who' d kill you for saying that .
really ?
yes .
so do i , come to that .
yeah ?
yeah .
what' s yours called ?
mine ?
he' s called marcus .
mine' s ali .
alistair .
and there it was .
it wasn' t a lie .
it was 100 percent her assumption .
well , 50 percent , at the very least .
i was in fantasyland again .
but this time it was different .
spat was for fun .
this was serious .
i acted in self defense .
we arranged to get our lads together .
which means we arranged for us to get together .
single parents , alone together .
happy new year !
i was in deep trouble .
and there was only one person who could help me out .
shake ya ass , but watch ya self shake ya ass , show me what you workin ' with
shake ya ass , watch ya self
" show me what you workin ' with " what did you just say to me ?
you heard me , squitty little shitty snot nosed bastard !
sorry .
i was singing along to this song by mystikal .
it' s a rap .
you like rap ?
a little .
it' s by black people , mostly .
they' re angry most of the time .
but sometimes they just want to have sex .
you taking a piss ?
' cause if you are , you' il get a slap .
i' m not taking a piss .
i don' t even know how to take a piss .
what' s your name ?
marcus .
i' m ellie .
hi , ellie .
nice to meet you .
not so fast .
i' m not ready for physical contact .
next thing you know , we' il be having sex .
and where will that get us ?
and stop telling strangers to shake their ass .
okay , ellie .
see you !
hello , mate .
listen , i need your help .
why did you tell this lady i was your son ?
no , i didn' t tell her .
i told you , she just got the wrong end of the stick .
so just tell her .
no .
can' t do that .
why not ?
we' re really going around in circles here .
just accept the facts , okay ?
you' re my son .
i' il tell her , if you like .
i don' t mind .
that' s very kind of you , marcus , but no .
why not ?
for christ' s sake !
she' s got a rare disease and if she believes something that' s not right ... ... then hears the truth , her brain will boil in her head and she' il die , okay ?
that' s a load of shit .
i' m really interested in this woman .
what do you mean , interested ?
what' s so interesting about her ?
okay , marcus , here .
here' s my last scrap of dignity .
enjoy it .
i want to go out with her .
okay ?
i' d like her to be my girlfriend .
there , i said it .
brilliant !
why didn' t you just say that ?
i don' t know .
i was embarrassed or something , ' cause this is a bit new for me .
i just met her , her name' s rachel .
she' s sort of
there' s this girl at school .
ellie .
i kind of want her to be my girlfriend .
i' m not exactly sure .
i' ve been meaning to ask you .
what' s the difference between a girl who' s your friend and a girlfriend ?
well , i don' t know .
do you want to touch her ?
is that so important ?
yeah , you' ve heard about sex , right ?
it is kind of a big deal .
i know .
i' m not stupid .
i just can' t believe there' s nothing more to it .
i mean , like , i want to be with her more .
i want to be with her all the time .
and i want to tell her things i don' t even tell you or mum .
and i don' t want her to have another boyfriend .
if i could have all those things ... ... i wouldn' t really mind if i touched her or not .
well , you' il learn , marcus .
you won' t feel like that forever .
okay , how do i look ?
good .
how do i look ?
just be as normal as you can , okay ?
good advice for marcus .
i wish i could have followed it .
i' m sorry it' s such a mess .
that' s where i work .
my mouth was dry and my palms sweating .
i didn' t know what the hell was happening to me . ... manage to tidy up .
ali ?
all i could do was stand there , grinning like an idiot .
should we just go upstairs ?
sure .
okay .
ali .
marcus .
marcus .
ali .
you' re in my year at school .
really ?
yeah , i think i' ve seen you around .
great !
then you guys' il have a lot to talk about .
will , this is ali .
ali , this is will .
all right .
all right .
do you guys want to hang up here for a while ?
yeah , sounds good , right ?
yeah .
okay .
for a moment , i loved him .
really loved him .
you can show him your new computer games .
good .
okay , catch you later .
let' s leave them to it .
if your dad goes out with my mum , then you' re dead .
really dead .
don' t worry .
he' s all right .
i don' t care if he' s all right !
i don' t want him going out with my mum !
i don' t want to see him or you around here ever again , okay ?
i' m not really sure it' s up to me .
well , it better be !
or you' re going to die .
i was getting the feeling that maybe this kid ali was a serial killer .
can i have a go on your computer ?
what games you got ?
are you listening to me ?
yeah , it' s just that i can' t really do much at the moment , can i ?
i mean , will , that' s my dad ... ... he likes your mum , and i think she' s keen on him .
she' s not keen on him !
she' s only keen on me !
one amazing thing about rachel ... ... was that i wanted to kiss her every time she said something interesting .
which was all the time .
it was sexy .
it was weird .
i use bristol boards , india ink and ....
am i boring you ?
no , no .
no .
what ?
nothing .
it' s just you looked like marcus just then .
did i ?
i think it' s sweet how much he seems to take after you ... ... and the way he dresses like you , as well .
i don' t think i dress like marcus , really .
marcus ?
wait !
hang on .
hang on .
come on , we' re going back .
he' s off his head .
no , he' s not .
he said he' d cut me up into little pieces and hide me under the floorboards .
he did ?
no .
but i' m sure he' s capable of it .
it' il be different .
you' il like it , i promise .
marcus , ali has something to say to you .
doesn' t he ?
sorry , marcus .
i didn' t mean to say those things .
it' s okay , ali .
ali finds all this very difficult .
yeah , so does marcus .
don' t you , mate ?
you know , i mean , divorced parents ... ... and not knowing how to feel about new people .
yes .
absolutely .
absolutely the way i feel .
ali didn' t get along with the last bloke i went out with .
he was a liar !
all right , darling .
he wasn' t 100 percent good news .
i' m not saying that you and i are .
that' s okay .
he fancies you .
he told me .
thanks a lot , mate .
oh , dear .
cheers , mate .
don' t look so worried , sweetheart .
ellie !
marcus ?
what , are you stalking me ?
no .
too bad .
made me feel like a celebrity .
yeah , but i didn' t know that then , did i , sexy ?
all i' m saying is , you know , watch out .
it just looks a bit more like owner and pet than boyfriend and girlfriend .
at least i' m honest .
what does that mean ?
it' s just that you and rachel ....
what ?
what does that mean ?
i don' t know , i think there' s a problem with you and rachel .
i mean , like , you want to be with her but she thinks you have a son .
and you don' t .
if you' re going to be with someone ... ... shouldn' t you tell them things like that ?
no .
i mean , you know , like the truth .
what' s wrong with you ?
but later that night , when i was on my own ... ... i remembered the deal marcus was prepared to strike .
yes , i wanted to touch rachel .
but at this moment , if i had the choice ... ... i' d settle for the less and the more that marcus wanted .
jesus , was i turning into marcus ?
would he be buying me shoes soon ?
i took his advice and told rachel the truth .
or very nearly the truth .
that i wasn' t marcus ' natural father .
and that is not natural seaweed .
the problem was , once i told the truth , i knew there' d be more questions .
i don' t get it .
if you' re not his natural father ... ... and you don' t live with him , then how is he your son ?
yeah , i see .
it must look very confusing from the outside .
tell me how it is on the inside .
it' s just one of those long , boring stories .
look , do you want to move on to wine ?
you want some chinese rice wine , miss ?
you would like to try , i suspect , the panang paneng .
yeah ?
no .
tell me about your relationship with ali .
ls that as complicated as mine and marcus ' ?
no .
i slept with his father , and then nine months later i gave birth .
pretty straight forward .
yeah .
i envy you that .
i' m really sorry to harp on about this but i haven' t got it all worked out yet .
you are marcus ' stepfather , but you don' t live with him or with his mother .
no , you see , wait .
i never said he was my son .
did i ?
the words " i have a son called marcus , " never escaped my lips .
it' s what you chose to believe .
yeah .
right .
it' s me that' s the fantasist .
i wanted to believe that you had a son , so i let my imagination run riot .
obviously i played a part , i can see that .
no !
not at all .
i met you and i thought , " cute guy .
god , if only he had a son .
a geeky , teenage kid , if possible .
then you turned up at my house with marcus , and bingo !
now i made this crazy link ' cause of some deep psychological need in me .
you shouldn' t beat yourself up about it .
it could have happened to anyone .
the first time i met you i thought you were a bit blank .
but then you changed my mind .
maybe i was right .
rachel , listen .
yes ?
i' m sorry , you' re right .
i am a blank .
i' m really nothing .
i don' t know what the hell i was thinking of , i' m sorry .
' bye , ellie .
marcus !
my man !
bye , marcus !
see you , marcus !
mum ?
so , if z = 17 , does x > 2 ?
marcus ?
i didn' t know what the answer was .
i didn' t know what " x " equaled .
and i didn' t know how to help my mum .
and then i realized .
there was something she said i could do for her .
i' m thinking of singing at the school concert .
you ?
at the rock concert ?
i don' t think that would be a very good idea , marcus .
will you accompany me ?
all i' ve got is a tambourine .
no , i' m sorry .
it' s suicide .
i mean , they' il crucify you .
mum' s at it again .
at what ?
sorry .
what do you mean , what ?
the crying .
she sits in the house all day , crying .
she does it in the mornings , too .
it' s as bad now as it was before the dead duck day .
marcus , i' m sorry , mate ... ... l' m a bit busy at the moment .
you' re busy ?
doing what ?
didn' t you hear me ?
i heard you .
what do you want me to do about it ?
i don' t know .
you could talk to her .
yeah ?
and what would i say ?
i don' t know !
why would she listen to me ?
who am i to her ?
i' m nobody .
you' re not nobody .
you' re  who ?
who do you think i am ?
who do you think you are ?
you come here uninvited , you disrupt my life , you screw things up .
what do you want from me ?
this isn' t my problem .
i' m not your family , mate .
i' m not .
i' m not your uncle .
i' m not your big brother .
we' ve established pretty firmly that i' m not your father , either , am i ?
but ....
i' il tell you what i am .
i' m the guy who' s really good at choosing trainers or records , okay ?
that' s it .
i can' t help you with real things .
i can' t help you with anything that means anything .
you could try .
you' re right .
you can' t help me .
how could you ?
you' re a stupid person who watches tv all day ... ... and buys things .
you don' t give a shit about anybody , and nobody gives a shit about you !
mum said my singing brought sunshine and happiness ... ... into her life .
so i' d do it , even if it meant mine was over .
look , mum .
my life is made up of units of time .
two units .
three units .
two units .
all in all , i had a very full life .
it' s just that it didn' t mean anything .
look who' s coming round the bend
marcus .
he was the only thing that meant something to me .
and fiona was the only thing that meant something to him .
and she was about to fall off the edge .
single parents alone together !
single parents alone together !
single parents alone together !
all for one and one for all !
fiona !
will , we haven' t seen you for a while .
how' s ned ?
who ?
he' s a load of crap .
he doesn' t exist .
yeah , i made him up .
you made him up ?
yeah .
to meet women .
you' re sick .
fiona , i' ve got to talk to you .
go ahead .
no , you know , properly talk to you , privately .
no , this is a circle of truth .
whatever you have to say , you can say it in front of everybody .
okay .
please don' t try and commit suicide again .
i can' t believe you just said that .
that is my private experience .
yeah , well , that' s the thing , isn' t it ?
it' s not .
marcus is worried about you .
i' m worried because he' s worried about you .
will , i don' t have plans to commit suicide .
you don' t ?
not at the moment , no .
great .
great !
good .
you know i' m not attracted to you , right ?
what are you on about ?
no .
what are you , nuts ?
right .
wrong word completely .
but that' s something that we should , you know , talk about a bit .
the crying in the morning thing , the depression .
let' s get that fixed .
that' s what men think , isn' t it ?
what ?
i know a bloke in the essex road who can fix that , " then there' s no point bothering .
no .
well , yeah , okay .
i would .
i' d love to know the name of the bloke in the essex road ... ... because i' ve got a feeling i' d be useless .
will , you' re not useless .
you' re here .
and that matters .
right .
now , can we ....
do you mind ?
what ?
marcus is singing at the school concert .
marcus is singing ?
yeah , singing .
at school ?
it' s a pop concert .
he' s so excited .
i want to get there on time .
wait , wait .
what' s he singing ?
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life
what time does this thing start ?
what have you got against marcus singing ?
you know the dream where you' re at school without your trousers on and everyone laughs ?
what' s the connection ?
that will be marcus , but for real .
if he sings that song in front of those kids ... ... you can just write him off until university .
if he reaches university , ' cause he' s going to get torn to shreds .
you cannot stop someone from expressing themselves .
he' s not expressing himself !
he' s expressing you , okay ?
oh , god .

what are you doing here ?
i heard you were about to commit social suicide , so i dropped by .
my accompanist left !
brilliant .
you don' t have to do it .
i can' t do that .

artistic differences .
you can' t work without him .
he had a drug problem .
my mum wants me to sing it .
it' il make her happy .
look , mate , nothing you do can make your mum happy , all right ?
not in the long term .
she has to do that for herself .
get over here right now !
just bugger off , will you !
what i' m saying is , the important thing is to make yourself feel happy .
i' ve tried just making myself happy .
she' s tried making herself happy .
it doesn' t work .
you need other people to make you happy .
but that' s just it .
if other people can make you happy then they can also make you unhappy .
what , you think those people out there are going to make you happy ?
hang on .
wait .
marcus , don' t .
marcus !
bollocks .
come on , britney !
yeah , give us a song , then .
this is for my mum .
i heard he sang a good song
i heard he had a style
and so i came to see him
to listen for a while
and there he was this young boy
a stranger to my eyes
you' re rubbish , mate !
strumming my pain with his fingers
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly
who the hell is that ?
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly with his song
i felt all flushed with fever
embarrassed by the crowd
i felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
i prayed that he would finish
but he just kept right on
strumming my pain with his fingers
singing my life with his words
killing me softly
give it a rest .
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words killing me softly
with his song
he sang as if he knew me
will .
in all my dark despair
we' re finished .
and then he looked right through me as if i wasn' t there
will , come on .
will , we' re finished .
so there i was , killing them softly with my song .
or rather , being killed .
and not that softly , either .
i was singing with my eyes closed .
was i frightened ?
i was petrified .
this was definitely not island living .
killing me softly
with his song
thank you , finsbury .
i' d like to introduce one or two members of the band .
marcus brewer on vocals and tambourine .
and that' s about it .
let' s get off quick .
get off .
marcus , thank you .
for the song .
you were terrific .
you think so ?
yeah .
as a matter of fact , i think we should celebrate .
okay .
how about mcdonald' s ?
mcdonald' s ?
yeah .
thanks , mum , but it' s okay .
no , really .
i want to go to mcdonald' s .
you know , i' m not really hungry .
come on .
are you telling me you couldn' t murder a big mac ?
mum !
okay , another time .
any time .
i' il be around a while , you know .
by the following christmas things were back to normal .
before you came
every man is an island .
and i stand by that .
but clearly , some men are part of island chains .
below the surface of the ocean they' re actually connected .
so you' re going to marry my mum , then ?
don' t know .
why ?
you think she' s up for it ?
i used to want him to marry my mum .
you serious ?
yeah .
but that was when she was depressed and i was desperate .
thanks , mate .
cheers .
how do you use this blender thing ?
you don' t .
i used to think two wasn' t enough .
christ .
now there were loads of people .
and that was great .
mostly .
are you two lazy bastards gonna get up and help , or what ?
so how do you know will ?
we volunteered together at amnesty international a couple years ago .
yeah , that' s right .
how is the burmese situation , tom ?
better ?
i mean good ?
yeah , and he called me up out of the blue for christmas lunch .
so , here i am .
really ?
so , listen , what' s the deal with you and ellie now ?
is she your girlfriend ?
are you insane ?
where did you get those trainers ?
why ?
what' s wrong with them ?
nothing .

by the way , i do think you and rachel have a shot .
i mean , if you don' t screw it up .
thank you .
i' d created a monster .
or maybe he created me .
i don' t know what will was so upset about .
all i meant was i don' t think couples are the future .
you need more than that .
you need backup .
the way i saw it , will and i both had backup now .
no man is an island .
