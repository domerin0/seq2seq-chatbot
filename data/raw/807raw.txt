hmm ?
take him back to solitary .
psst .
have a nice week' s holiday .
yeah , lovely .
there is a way out .
what ?
listen .
convince the governor the best way to train the guards ... is to play a really tough match against a team of cons ... with you as the captain .
well , pros always have a preseason friendly .
well , what do you think , mr. burton ?
could be winwin for everybody .
well , could this work , meehan ?
yeah .

ooh , i could get a real f. a. ref .
there' s one at my golf club .

acid .
you see , the governor lets sykes get his racing times ... and other papers special delivery .
he thinks it helps sykes work out form ... and give him tips .
he doesn' t know that they' re presoaked in acid .
he' s actually smuggling sykes' s drugs in for him .
he came second , and it cost me 5, 000 pounds .
you must have made the wrong bet .
w " for win .

if it means getting out early , i' il take another beating from your mob .

i don' t think so , mate .
good job he likes you .
he blew up five people he didn' t .
they' re stupid , you know .
they won' t even let me in their shitty squad or nothing like that .
i don' t give a fuck about their fuckin ' squad !
do you understand me ?
if you want out of this fuckin ' prison ... you gotta come up with something to spoil their little party .
otherwise , you' re fucked .
okay , okay , okay , relax .
00 tomorrow morning .
ah , mr. burton .
thank you .
it' s only a paper .
mmhmm .

search him .
what you looking at , freak ?
you were grassed up .
eh ?
that dodgy fuckin ' meehan is getting well pally with mr. burton .
i' ve seen ' em talking .
what are you doing , ketch ?
no one likes a rat , danny boy .
what do you mean a rat , eh , chiv ?
the big man' s right .
we' re gonna see what we can do about them beady eyes , eh ?
fuck , you know it weren' t me .

i cut myself shaving .

it' s the altitude .
ooh , you wanna get that seen to .
right , that' s a yellow card , gentlemen .
behave yourselves .
you wanna be more careful with this .
you could have had my eye out .
thanks , by the way .
you saved me a lot of grief back there .
sorry about that .
that' s all right .
anyway , you need a few more players .
what about your lot over there ?
don' t think so .
not against sykes' s lot .
not that some of them wouldn' t be up for it .
what makes you bulletproof ?
he' s not ... but he' s well friendly with one bloke that sykes is nervous about .
who ?
the monk , man .
that dude is beyond mental .
and so are his pals on the outside .
sykes , he wants a smooth flow .
all he really cares about is profit .
what money ?
what money ?
you' re a betting man .
we' il make a deal .
let your lads play .
win or lose ... you call the result , bet accordingly .
back to your fixing the match routine , right ?
now , listen .
it' s like this .
i' d never take a bet against england ... and i wouldn' t bet the screws against the cons .
then we can play to win .
would you think about it ?
yes , i' il think about it .
but right now , i' m thinking you' re polluting my air .
now go away .
how' d it go ?
it didn' t .
here , dan .
dan
i' ve been thinking .
leave the thinking to me , billy .
yeah , yeah , of course , dan .
well , what it is , dan
i was wondering if
wondering what , billy ?
can i be on the team ?
the squad , billy .
you can be on the squad .
i won' t let you down , danny .
you know that , don' t you ?
yes , the squad , yes !
come on !
well in , bill .
well done !
yeah , the squad , the squad !
well in .
yes , you told me they were reasonable .
they are reasonable , but they' re businessmen .
you got me into this , and you can get me out .
i opened the door , you walked through it .
you' ve been making money ever since .
so why haven' t you got it ?
it is just a temporary cashflow problem .
the team is bleeding me dry .
well , get it sorted .
because this lot have got a bad habit of turning cashflow problems ... into bloodflow problems .
i used to do double this just for a warm up , you know .
anno domini , mate .
i used to be able to piss in one go ... and then forget about it for the rest of the morning .
you never did say how come it ain' t done your nut in here being in so long .
only does your nut if you don' t think you should be here .
look at me .
sweet old man , huh ?
bit bumbly , full of jailblock wisdom .
cornerstone of the jail , put in with the foundations , right ?
right .
i didn' t get to be the oldest con for breakin ' windows .
villains spend their lives shitting themselves ... that other criminals are going to seize them .
so they get their retaliation in first and twice as nasty .
a bloke was comin ' after me .
so i ...
i went around to his digs and lobbed a grenade in the window .
left over after the war , you know .
army surplus .
i didn' t know , but he had his little baby ... and his girl in there with him .
the house went up like a firecracker .
no one came out .
he barricaded the door with furniture in case i came around .
by the time they got in , the screamin ' had stopped .
thirteen months old .
learning to walk , apparently .
nothing i can do is ever gonna make up for that , is it ?
you' re on .
what' s that , a joke ?
i' m not famous for my sense of humor .
i know nitro' s the grass , not you .
one thingyou fight one of my boys .
fight ?
a little earner i stage now and then .
i can' t be seen giving you a free ride .
fight who ?
fight him .
soft as puppy shit , nick is .
i' m an exfootballer , charlie , not a boxer .
so ?
kick him .
an eye for an eye , you bastard .
fucking eye for a fucking boo !
don' t you do that again .
calm down , silly beggar .
you seem to be making more fucking enemies by the minute .
yeah ?
well , i want out ... of this shithouse !
please !
please !
you' re halfway home , son .
i' m taking you down to segregation now .
that' s why i' m here .
yeah ?
yeah .

silverino sands , yeah ?
boom , boom , boom , boom .
i will do anything , mr. ratchett , sir .
i will do anything , mr. ratchett .
you owe me for this .
out .
now .
we have a small change of plan .
nick has come over all poorly ... so i had to bring on a substitute .
walk away , danny .
walk away .
mass , this is the only way we' re gonna get these boys to play .
in the dirty brown corner , with a record of 350 ... all coming by the way of the big k o ... the heavyduty champion of the penal world ...
ketch , the black country bastard !
come on !
and in the other equally dirty brown corner , we have the challenger .
formerly known as " the mean machine .
danny " i' ve had more bloody backhanders than boris becker " ...
meehan !
gentlemen , it' s alternate punches ... followed by one mug of fivestar prison cognac .
cheers .
no using your left hand .
no butting , biting ... spitting , poking or kissing , you .
it' s show time !
first head to hit the table loses .
first punch to the challenger .
is he trying to kiss me or what ?
keep your head off the table .
head up !
hey !
hey !
focus , danny .
wake up !
he fuckin ' he fuckin '
get the water on him .
straighten yourself up , danny .
concentrate .
focus , danny !
easy , easy , easy , easy .
by the way ...
i' m in here for assault and battery .
troj , water !
come on !
come on !
keep your head up .
keep your head up !
i' m in here for drunken assault .
yeah !
first up , i' d like to welcome mr. sykes' s boys .
now watch this .
hey , all right !
nice , danny .
okay , if you wanna do that , join a circus .
it' s no good to us .
what we need is 11 men to play as a team .
right ?
right !
yes !
that' s lovely , dan , that .
well in .
okay , positions .
now i play center midfield .
let' s have all the midfield players behind me defenders to me left , strikers to me right .

that' s good .
now pass it .
pass it , trojan !
pass it !
trojan , it' s a team game !
pass to our team !
he' s too greedy .
okay , fellas .
now the key to set pieces is concentration ... calculation , teamwork .
with corners , it' s about movement ... drawing defenders out of position .
when it comes to defending ... it' s about tackling ... finesse ... calculation .
now remember these simple rules and we' re in with a chance .
any questions ?
lovely story .
yeah .
we still need a goalkeeper .
somebody to boss the defense about .
well , there' s one man i know who could boss our defno .
no .
fuck that .
that' s not even worth thinking about .
who ?
who ?
no , you' il laugh your head off .
who ?
the monk .
the monk ?
can he play ?
well , they say he could have turned pro before he turned mad .
how mad is he ?
he' s the scot that even scots fear .
what did he do ?
something very dark up in glasgow .
i heard he ate hannibal the cannibal .
let me tell you something .
not even the pope could get him out of the special wing .
well , monk is in the highsecurity wing .
so do me a favor .
maybe i can help you with barry the bookie .
i' m listening .
bet the game , your guards to win .
price is right , we make a killing .
you pay off barry and have some left .
take the missus to malaga .
this is so illegal .
i think " criminal " is the word .
all right , big man .

danny meehan , he' s all right .

he' s got a wee favor to ask you .

he said it was an accident .
you' re not worried about the opposition , are you , mr. burton ?
a team of life' s losers , led by a man who can be bought and sold .
i don' t think so .
not when the game' s about character .
we' il give you a match .

one , two , three , four !
and left , and right .
and left , and right .
and left , and right .
and left , and right .
hurry it up there !
i told you two to keep the center tight !
i' ve also always told you to wear tieups on your socks .
now you , get over there and mark up .
and you , bugger off .
four !
five !
now listen , daniel .
i' m not putting you under pressure , right ?
but i' m burning up phone cards ... taking bets from prisons up and down the country .
oh , no .
and despite what the governor thinks ...
i' m betting us to win .
so my arse is on the line .
and by my arse , i mean your arse .
okay , lads , need a volunteer .
yep , dan .
dan .
yeah , all right , bill .
give monk and chiv a hand with their demonstration .
lovely .
cheers , danny .
aye , right , so , we are the cons ... and they are the screws .
so if anybody' s gonna play dirty , it' s gonna be they fuckers .
so here' s one or two wee examples , just to keep us a step ahead .
know what i mean ?
numero uno
the accidental tread on the toe .
it' s an obvious one , but it works .
aw , fuck !
numero two
right , daftie .
run towards the monk .
what now ?
yeah ?
on you go , half pace .
the cunningly titled " elbow in the face . " very , very effective .
but you do tend to get sent off , so if you' re gonna use it ... make sure the ref' s not looking .
number four .
hold up .
hold up .
what happened to number three ?
when you' re helping them up ... grab the hairs under his armpits and twist them round .
hurts like a bastard , doesn' t it ?
yeah .
number five .
wait .
i' m gonna have a sitdown .
i don' t want to hog it .
let one of these have a go .
you' re all right , bill .
you' re the man .
you' re hard .
get in there .
yeah , as it happens , yeah .
no , go on , yeah .
and finally , the piece de resistance .
number 23 .
i can' t .
monk , stop .
i' m in a bad way , mate .
monk , i can' t breathe !
oh , fuck !
the guillotine .
come on then .
let' s move on .
get yourself up .
you' re making the place look untidy .
was that all right , though , dan ?
cream .
well done , lads .
finish with a bit of shooting practice .
troj , you come out and lay them off .
massive , marks out of ten .
you done well with that lot .
passes the time , doc .
you know , it' s not a crime to admit enjoying it .
you' re becoming a sentimental old fart , ain' t you ?
go on , troj , hit it !
that bloody meehan .
who does he think he is , eh ?
don' t you worry about meehan .
i' ve got something sorted for him .
mr. popular , time to meet your friends .
you can' t put me back on the wing , sir .
you scratch my back ...
sykes will fuckin ' kill me .
i' il scratch yours .
sykes will kill me .
you know the itch i want scratching .
i don' t want meehan on that pitch .
you understand ?
okay .
i know what needs to be done .
nice and easy .
right down the middle .
and aone ...
and atwo .
good shot .
good shot .
where you been ?
the governor' s been waiting .
it' s the end of your shift .
i' il take him straight in .
okay , miss .
i' ve thought of a way i can really help you .
the sad old twat videos all their games .
really ?
and i' ve written some pointers .
my own little dossier on the guards , like funny habits and that .
i' m sure you' il find it interesting .
now can you hurry up ?
we haven' t got much time .
quicker !
one thing .
what ?
this is strictly sex .
i ain' t gonna respect you after .
i don' t blame you .
girls like to brag at the pub as well .
i' ve heard .
what ?
what ?
easy .
change your oil , did you ?
gentlemen should never kiss and tell , massive .
you know that .
i think i' d better go home .
massive , inside information on the opposition .
read it careful .
it' s really important .
all right , danny .
there' s a meeting now in mr. sykes' s cell .
all right , lads , a bit of windup material on the opposition .
ketch , this one' s for you .
you know old ratchett keeps going on about his dodgy knee .
well , it' s the right one .
this one is dynamite .
marsden' s daughter donna ... has been known to dabble in quite a few different class a drugs .
let him know about it at the right time .
here we go , danny boy .
danny boy .
and now for our secret weapon .
danny , tape .
oh , shit .
i forgot it .
left it in me locker .
ah , yeah , i need a piss anyway .
cheers , doc .
sorry , boys .
that' s all right .
get the old boy working .
danny , why did you do it ?
throw that game .
fuck me , jerome .
you do talk too much .
sorry .
no , you' re all right .
it' s funny ... but when you' re in that football world ... you just don' t realize what it means to people .
and you only find out how disappointed they are when you let them down .
i was 16 when i signed pro forms .
thought i was the business .
didn' t take long for standards to start slipping .
cars , booze , bad tips for slow horses .
you think you can handle it , then bang very soon it' s handling you .
before i was picking up trophies ...
i was 425 grand down ... to men nasty enough to
well , they even would have put the wind up mr. sykes .
but they did give me two choices a wheelchair for life ... or a deliberate penalty against the germans .
it' s not as if i' ve prospered .
look where i' ve ended up .
but i' il tell you something
i didn' t start off as a youngster looking to sell me country out .
none of us planned to be here , mate .
you' re a hero in scotland .
sign it , and i' il ship you straight out of here .
okay .
you know , even down here it ain' t safe from sykes .
he' s put a price on your head , sunshine .
killing doc was a big mistake .
fuck him .
where am i off to , boys ?
the hmp silver sands , where all the rich go ?
not exactly .
no .
no ?
no .
you' re gonna catch the ghost train out of here ... to the funny farm .
the funny farm .
her majesty' s prison broadhurst .
what ?
i' m gonna get you !
yeah !
i' il find your house !
i' m gonna blow it up !
no , you won' t !
by the time the orderlies are finished with you ... you won' t be able to blow your fucking nose !
let me out !
i' m gonna get you !
i reckon you' re quits now , old man .
no , don' t don' t you worry about the car .
i' d have my bloody house on this one .
done deal , darling .
yes .
wanker .
okay , gentlemen .
you' ve got 90 minutes ... to show them that when it comes to physical and mental strength ... they can' t touch us .
most of them are gonna want to mix it up out there .
don' t get involved .
all right , lads .
you wanna be nothing ... numbers , prisoners , that' s fine .
if you win out there today , you' il have something to remember forever .
you' il talk about it over and over .
' cause up and down the country cons are sick about not being here today ... just to have one crack at those bastards next door .
let' s win , and let' s win well .
lose , and they' il never let you forget it .
run your guts out , you' il have something here they can never touch .
no parole boards , judges ... or nutcase governors .
they' ve got one good player .
but he' s had his moment , and this is a team game .
now , ask yourselves one question .
are you ready ?
yes .
are we ?
yes !
well , come on !
so i' m lookin ' at each and every one of you lads ... to get out there and show them who' s boss !
come on !
hold up for mr. sykes .
doc was a different generation .
and he saved all his life .
but before he died , he had me sort out these .
come and get ' em , mates !
good afternoon .
i' m bob likely .
you join us live from the recreation field .
yes , i' m bob carter .
and thanks once again to our esteemed governor wanker for providing the splendid facilities that are here ... as part of his progressive rehabilitation campaign .
for our audience who are cooped up inside , here' s a weather report .
it' s a beautiful day , bob .
and what a day it is .
and the waiting' s over .
yes , the guards are out first ... fronted by mr. burton .
and here comes the mean machine , led out ... by our most famous son , danny meehan .
don' t worry .
the boys are up for it .
i' m not worried .
where' d they get those uniforms ?
cheeky bastards .
mean machine !
mean machine !
skip .
skip .
your call .
heads .
heads we are , then .
okay .
this is the one .
take your chances .
don' t start anything .
if they do , finish it , okay ?
yeah !
come on , then !
simple ball every time , eh ?
boy , mr. sykes , you look the part .
all you need now is a
here we go , bob .
it' s the big one we' ve all been waiting for .
longmarsh prison guards versus longmarsh prison cons .
it' s the cons to kick off .
ref !
a free kick to the cons .
ketch has just floored mr. ratchett .
what' s the matter with you ?
shut up , you pussy .
ow !
you fat bastard !
ow !
you fat bastard !
well done , ketch .
just be subtle .
which one' s he , then ?
come on .
take him out , son !
and trojan evades marsden brilliantly .
if only he could have done that the night he got nicked .
keeper plays it long .
walker brings it down to the halfway line .
and it' s a misplaced pass to jerome mcfife .
but the everobservant mr. burton kicks it back to the guards .
it' s a neat onetwo .
walker to burton .
back to walker .
he shoots .
ooh !
just past the post .
almost .
and that was too close for comfort .
too fucking close for my liking , bob .
get up there !
monk plays it out to danny meehan .
meehan has it in the center .
goes forward unchallenged .
it' s a onetwo .
and burton has taken meehan' s legs away .
and meehan does not look happy .
that' s it , burton !
now , what' s the matter with the rest of you , eh ?
you four stand there .
split on my run .
i want to try something .
meehan to take it .
looks like he might chip this one , bob .
right at ratchett' s crown jewels .
it' il take more than a magic sponge to take the sting out of that .
fuck me .
for christ' s sake , ref , that was bloody deliberate .
free kick .
and ball .
protect yourself at all times .
you what ?
ten yards !
ten !
come away !
right in his carrots and onions .
no nookie for mr. ratchett .
no nookie for mrs. ratchett neither .
play on !
just goes to show , bob , lightning can strike twice .
absofuckin' lutely , bob .
23 minutes of the first half to go and it' s getting heated out there .
oh , yeah , bob .
very rock and roll .
fuckin ' hell .
he' s got to get back in goal .
well , i ain' t tellin ' him .
piss off , you scotch bastard .
how' s your daughter , by the way ?
donna ?
still hanging about street corners and that to feed the habit ?
what' s up with ya ?
for christ' s sake !
that' s it , fellas !
good teamwork !
that is a hard but a fair tackle , bob .
yeah , it was a fair challenge .
but that wasn' t .
oh , and this could be dangerous for the cons , bob .
a free kick here .
you' re back in afterwards .
don' t think i didn' t see it .
ketch has took his drop .
the guards look determined to convert this .
make it count !
get him !
the monk' s collected it cleanly .
the monkcalm and calculated .
looks like the therapy' s paying off .
and once again , monk' s played it out to trojan ... who' s again switched to the left .
he must be ambidextrous .
i don' t know about that , but he sure can use both feet .
goal !
goal !
yeah !
beauty !
you beauty !
go on , my son !
go on , my son !
we' re all over ' em .
onenil , to the mean machine .
it' s the guards to kick off .
it' s getting tough out there , bob .
you can say that again , bob .
it' s getting tough out there , bob .
never mind , bob .
oh , no , bob .
it looks like the monk' s at it again .
pass it !
do that again , i' il rip your head off .
ref , did you hear that ?
i' m not worried .
he said it to you , not me .
let' s go , sonny .
what is he doing ?
don' t ask me .
you' re the skipper .
you tell him .
bollocks .
hold on .
oi !
you great fucker !
ooh , it' s kicked off .
let' s just try and keep calm .
referee !
go on !
get in there !
go on !
chin him !
this isn' t a football match !
do him !
do him !
go on !
this is bollocks .
hey .
come on .
hit him !
fuck you !
this is bollocks !
what the fuck' s going on here ?
where the fuck are you , referee ?
excuse me .
sorry .
calm down , everybody !
come on !
ref , how long ?
bollocks .
that' il do .
halftime .
come on .
one nil , to the mean machine one nil
and what do you think you' re doing ?
you' re supposed to throw this game .
yeah .
the boys don' t seem to be taking much notice of me .
youthful exuberance .
shame .
would have worked out nice .
that' s halftime .
what do you think meehan will be saying to the boys ?
he' d be telling them that there' s only 45 minutes left to play .
yeah .
well done .
well done .
settle down , boys .
have a listen .
we ain' t won nothing yet .
all we got is one goal .
now , this half is when we' re gonna earn it .
midfield , tuck in .
get round behind the ball .
monk
good work , monk .
just don' t leave us exposed at the back , all right ?
mouse it' s me nose .
bill , you come on for mouse .
where am i playing ?
take his place .
come midfield with me .
frenchy , have a look at his nose .
okay , lads , we' ve botched it , but we' re onenil down .
mr. hayter , when the overlap comes you think about it .
we' re getting beaten by a bunch of worthless criminals .
i' m doing my halftime talk , sir .
you sit down .
have you forgotten who they are ?
they' re the dregs of society and they' re in the next dressing room ... and they' re laughing at you right now .
every man here is playing for his job .
including you .
you wanted to see me ?
yes .
what the hell' s going on ?
you wanted a game .
yes , but you never said anything about winning .
i never said nothing about losing either .
before leaving us , nitro wrote a confession .
he admitted to killing doc .
said you knew about it , and that you sent doc to your cell .
now , that' s accessory to murder .
and that' s 20 years .
you' il never get that to stick .
one whiff of this ... will kill you with the parole board .
oh , you could be with us for some time .
so i think it' s in everyone' s interest ... if you lose this game .
i can' t do that .
well , you' ve done it before .
you had everything they ever dreamed of ... and you threw it all away .
meehan !
meehan has given it away again .
fuck sake , danny .
i was open .
i didn' t see you .
looks like he' s in a fuckin ' world of his own .
wake up , meehan !
the ball' s played to the left .
hibert picks it up ... and moves forward to the edge of the 18yard box .
the defender cuts inside .
he plays it neatly to hayter , who knocks it for downes .
oh , no !
he' s been brought down in the area .
could be a penalty .
the ref' s waved play on and
oh , no , bob .
what goes through monk' s head ?
scary thought , bob .
yeah , i' d hate to think about what he dreams about .
it' s getting a bit naughty out there , bob .
positively brutal .
don' t know whether they' re fighting or doing a tango .
no , they' re definitely fighting .
billy the limpet , bless him .
he' s chasing the ball like a little terrier .
shame he hasn' t the skill to match his enthusiasm .
shame he' s fuckin ' useless , bob .
absofuckin' lutely , bob .
ratchett' s taken out cigs .
the guards are taking no prisoners .
you get it , bob ?
whatever , bob .
you fucking watch it .
no , you fucking watch it , you fat bastard .
that' s going a bit too far , isn' t it ?
he took a dive !
number seven .
violent conduct .
off the park .
it was a dive !
look !
come on .
do one , now .
fuck off .
it' s a straight red .
the cons are down to ten men .
well , it' s an early bath for raj ... which is really gonna put pressure on the mean machine .
it' s disappointing , but you can be sure it' s not going to be easy out there .
that' s right , bob .
they' re taking full advantage of the extra man on the pitch .
walker' s through ball to mr. gayle , who plays it .
and hayter .
and monk !
superb save , way down to his left .
all right !
all right !
29 minutes , bob .
still onenil .
and the cons are holding out .
the monk' s gone on another walkabout !
but this time he plays it safe to trojan out wide .
all troj has to do is look up .
come on .
pass it .
pass it .
pass .
pass it .
pass it .
pass it .
pass it !
pass the fucking ball !
yeah !
goal !
two nil to the cons .
ten men down , their liberty taken away from them ...
locked in a cell for 23 hours a day ... and today our boys have their day .
what' s up with you ?
for the last hour of my life sentence ...
i have been free !
mean machine !
mean machine !
mean machine !
mean machine !
yes !
it' s the guards to kick off .
mr. williams lays it back for mr. hibert ... who whips a beautiful ball into the box .
monk' s got it covered .
safe as houses .
oh , you' ve gotta love the monk .
gotta love the monk .
what' s monk doing ?
he' s left an empty net !
he' s lost the fuckin ' ball !
he' s lost the fuckin ' plot .
guards ' goal .
twoone .
yes !
hey !
stop fucking about back here !
get the ball up the park !
all right .
my fault .
it' s no longer just a game out there .
there' s a match on now .
have a word , dan .
fuck off , trojan .
come on , lads .
let' s go .
come on , boys .
the cons kick off .
but what is he doing ?
he' s given it straight away .
oh !
he' s hit the bar !
you see ?
there' s no cohesion .
there' s no character , eh ?
the mean machine really need their star player ... to pick up his game now .
what is meehan doing , anyway ?
it' s like he' s not even on the pitch .
what' s up with you ?
i never touched you .
looks like danny' s injured .
you' re cheating now , are you ?
once a loser , always a loser .
what happened ?
where' d you get hit ?
down there .
doesn' t look too clever , boys .
i can' t see anything .
come on .
let' s get him up .
all right , ref .
come on , danny .
don' t put no weight on it .
looks like meehan is leaving the pitch .
lets hope they bring a sub on .
it' s 11 against 9 out there .
frenchy , i' ve got it .
get it fixed .
okay , mr. sykes .
we got it .
shove up and shut up .
the guards are really moving the ball about nicely .
oh .
neat passing .
but the cons are determined not to give up .
there' s nothing wrong with that leg , is there ?
why don' t people just let me play this game ?
didn' t think you' d sell us out .
not after the big " it' s your time " speech .
is there something i should know ?
he' s fucked something up .
could be a strain .
it' s getting tough out there .
the guards are putting the pressure on .
fuckin ' hell , massive !
help us out !
we' ve only got nine men on !
get a sub on !
walker to marsden .
downes wide to hibert .
hibert clips it forward .
walker brings it down .
the cons are swamped at the back .
ratchett' s free in the area .
yes !
yes !
twofuckingtwo .
good one .
good one .
thanks , danny meehan .
come on , lads .
twotwo .
right .
now a third .
get up there .
ref !
sub !
mass , look it' s your life .
ratchett just brought down billy the limpet .
that' s like kicking a puppy dog , bob .
give me my boot .
yes !
ref !
ref !
i' m coming back on .
sit the fuck down , man .
forget it , meehan .
who' s coming on ?
me .
him .
you' re playing like crap and you know it .
will you make up your mind ?
who' s in charge here ?
i' m in charge .
i' m the manager .
danny' s coming on .
hold it !
listen , i' m the owner .
you ?
yes .
the owner ?
yes .
behave .
manager' s decision .
you .
on .
the great danny meehan returns to the pitch .
yeah .
that' s all we fuckin ' need .
if he carries on playing like he did before he went off ... we may as well all go home now , bob .
ketch knocks it out wide to trojan .
it' s amazing .
the guards are still finding it hard to deal with this man .
i' m with you here if you want !
yes , troj !
troj , pass it !
i' m on !
pass here !
trojan plays it into the center .
i' m free there .
yeah , well ...
i didn' t fucking see you , did i ?
oh , really .
chiv !
chiv , lay off !
pass it !
chiv , pass it !
pass
god , that was a meeting of minds .
not a pretty sight .
it looks like danny meehan' s trying to redeem himself .
he' s gonna have to do a fuck lot of work to manage that , bob .
danny meehan is now everywhere .
he' s bobbing and weaving , bob .
no way was that offside !
that' s the way it' s done , pal .
the ball' s pushed high into the guards ' half .
cigs pulls it down .
shoots .
oh , it' s a goal !
the mean machine are out in front again !
there' s a flag .
god bless the mean machine .
keep your shirt on .
something' s up .
there' s something going on , bob .
the mean machine are celebrating .
i think it' s been disallowed .
the ref has gone to the linesman .
there' s confusion on the pitch .
there certainly is , bob .
they' re conferring .
oh , surely not !
yeah , yeah .
if this stands ... it' s a free kick to the guards 35 yards out from the goal .
get up , you bloody tart !
aah !
easy .
okay .
let' s get him off .
it' s in a goalscoring position if i' ve ever seen one , bob .
we' re in the dying seconds of the game .
it' s twotwo .
lee , get changed .
you' re on , mate .
ref !
mr. ratchett , are you all right , sir ?
obviously not .
all right .
take him away .
are you gonna do absolutely nothing about that ?
it' s a free kick .
now take it .
how long , ref ?
just moving into injury time .
this is it .
if he scores now , it' s all over .
all right , gaylie .
stick it in .
and prison warder mr. gayle will take it .
he curls it .
heading to the top righthand corner !
guards of pentonville , guards of wandsworth
walton nick in liverpool policemen of britain
traffic wardens parole officers , wheelclampers ... your boys have taken a hell of a beating today !
a hell of a beating !
