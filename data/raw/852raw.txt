# roaming through the hood in a super sport
# bumper too short
# 18' s got the rear view mirror' s vibrating
# and deep dish dating
# you know how we do it , ain' t nothing to it
# but the floss of the crowd , harris & ross
# ' cause if you fuck with ours , we leave scars
# on a " g " right course , living like stars
# might hit the highway on the vegas run
# fool , ' cause it' s friday
# oh , yeah , throw your neighbourhood in the air
# if you don' t care
# oh , yeah , throw your neighbourhood in the air
# if you don' t care
# standing outside on the friday
# living on the edge
# ' cause we all got them hard heads
# it seems like we all away
# for the drive by , playing tag with satan
# but we chillin ' , yeah , we ready and willin '
# you hear about the latest west side killing ?
# but we slippin ' , say trippin '
# for dipping , pistol gripping , never slipping
# big g' s trying to hang out
# but old " g " said , take your little ass in the house
# my big homie just got out
# used to be damned , now we just crack dead
# he' s about as hard as darth vader
# in his sweatshirt , khakis , and chuck taylors
# just seen them in the driveway
# getting beat like a smoker , fool , ' cause it' s friday
# oh , yeah , throw your neighbourhood in the air
# if you don' t care
# oh , yeah , throw your neighbourhood in the air
# if you don' t care , fool
# why must i be like that and chase the cat ?
# or settle for a hood rack ?
# do be brave
# no dreadlocks flying in and out of town
# with half a chicken and a cock
# and i love her
# ' cause she dared to fuck around
# with the underground
# pussy hound , and her ass is big , round , and wide
# jacked up , making niggers down the rye
# smoking in dope , playing that super nintendo
# hear a rat a tat on my window
# there goes that pelvic thrust
# don' t trust a rubber , ' cause it' s bound to bust
# in the oven , in the nappy
# i had on 2 , so i was happy
# ' cause that hlv will make your dick hang sideways
# and that ain' t cool , fool , ' cause it' s friday
# throw your neighbourhood in the air , if you don' t care
# oh , yeah , throw your neighbourhood in the air
# if you don' t care . #
