i never knew the old vienna before the war ... with its strauss music , its glamor and easy charm .
constantinople suited me better .
i really got to know it in the classic period of the black market .
we' d run anything if people wanted it enough and had the money to pay .
of course , a situation like that does tempt amateurs ... but , you know , they can' t stay the course like a professional .
now the city , it' s divided into four zones , you know , each occupied by a power the american , the british , the russian and the french .
but the center of the city , that' s international , policed by an international patrol , one member of each of the four powers .
wonderful !
what a hope they had , all strangers to the place ... and none of them could speak the same language , except a sort of smattering of german .
good fellows , on the whole .
did their best , you know .
vienna doesn' t really look any worse than a lot of other european cities .
bombed about a bit .
oh , wait .
i was gonna tell you about holly martins , an american , came all the way here to visit a friend of his .
the name was lime .
harry lime .
now , martins was broke , and lime had offered him some sort of a job .
anyway , there he was , poor chap , happy as a lark and without a cent .
passport , please .
oh .
what' s the purpose of your visit here ?
a friend offered me a job .

of course .
thanks .
schmolka ?
i guess nobody knew harry like he did , or like i did .
how long ago ?
back in school .
i was never so lonesome in my life till he showed up .
when did you see him last ?
september , ' 39 .
when the business started ?
mm hmm .

once in a while .
best friend i ever had .
that sounds like a cheap novelette .
well , i write cheap novelettes .
i' m afraid i' ve never heard of you .
what' s your name again ?
holly martins .
no , sorry .
you ever hear of the lone rider of santa fe ?
can' t say that i have .
death at double x ranch ?
uh , raunch .
nope .
he must' ve known i was broke .
he even sent me an airplane ticket .
it' s a shame .
what ?
him dying like that .
best thing that ever happened to him .
what are you trying to say ?
he was about the worst racketeer in this city .
policeman , huh ?
come on , have another drink .
no , i never did like policemen .
i have to call them sheriffs .
ever seen one ?
pin it on a dead man .
some petty racket with gasoline or something .
just like a cop .
you' re a real cop , i suppose .
it wasn' t petrol .
so it wasn' t petrol .
so it was tires or saccharin or
why don' t you catch a few murderers for a change ?
well , you could say that murder was part of his racket .
it' s all right , paine .
he' s only a scribbler with too much drink in him .
take mr. holly martins home .
holly martins , sir ?
the , uh , the writer ?
the author of death at double x ranch ?
listen , callaghan  calloway .
i' m english .
you' re not going to close your files at a dead man' s expense .
so you' re going to find me the real criminal ?
sounds like one of your stories .
when i' m finished with you , you' il leave vienna .
here' s some army money .
it should see you through tonight at sacher' s hotel , if you don' t drink too much in the bar .
we' il keep a seat for you on tomorrow' s plane .
please be careful , sir .
up we come .

take him to sacher' s .
don' t hit him again if he behaves .
and you go carefully there .
it' s a military hotel .
i' m so glad to have met you , sir .
i' ve read quite a few of your books .
auf wiedersehen .
i like a good western .
that' s what i like about them .
you can pick them up and put them down anytime .
oh , mr. hartman ?
yes , sir ?
mr. calloway said this gentleman' s got to have a room for the night .
passport , please .
can' t very well introduce you to everybody .
would you mind filling this in ?
mr. crabbin .
what is it , sergeant ?
mr. holly martins , the author .
who ?
thought you might be interested .
never heard of him .
he' s very good , sir .
i' ve read quite a few of his books .
author ?
martins ?
thank you , sergeant .
mr. martins ?
my name' s crabbin .
i represent the c. r. s. of g. h. q.
you do ?
yes .
cultural reeducation section .
propaganda .
very important in a place like this .
we do a little show each week .
last week we had hamlet .
the week before we had ... something .
the striptease , sir .
yes , the hindu dancers .
thank you .
this is the first opportunity of making an american author welcome .
welcome ?
i' il tell you what , mr. martins .
on wednesday night , we' re having a little lecture on the contemporary novel .
thought perhaps you' d like to speak .
they wouldn' t know me .
nonsense .
your novels are very popular here .
aren' t they , sergeant ?
very popular .
are you staying long ?
how long can one stay here on this stage money ?
listen , mr. martins , if you' d agree to be our guest ,
we' d be delighted to have you .
would you ?
as long as you care to stay .
he' s due to leave tomorrow .
have you got a toothache .
number 8 , mr. martins .
come upstairs a moment .
i know a very good dentist .
i don' t need a dentist .
somebody hit me , that' s all .
goodness .
we must report that .
were they trying to rob you ?
oh , just a soldier .
i was trying to punch his major in the eye .
a major ?
were you really ?
heard of harry lime ?
i' ve heard of him , but i didn' t exactly know him .
i was going to stay with him , but he died thursday .
goodness , that' s awkward .
ls that what you say to people after death ?
goodness , that' s awkward ?
mr. martins ?
excuse me .
telephone .
who is it ?
baron kurtz .
must be some mistake .
yes ?
i was a friend of harry lime .
i' d very much like to meet you , baron .
come around .
austrians aren' t allowed in your hotel .
couldn' t we meet at the mozart cafe ?
where ?
just around the corner .
how will i know you ?
i' il carry a copy of one of your books .
harry gave it to me .
be there in a moment .
wait a minute .
lf i do this lecture business , you' il put me up here a while ?
certainly .
it' s a deal .
did you ever read the lone rider of santa fe ?
no , not that one .
it' s a story about a man who hunted down a sheriff who was victimizing his best friend .
seems exciting .
it is .
i' m gunning just the same way for your major callaghan .
sounds anti british , sir .
baron kurtz ?
mr. martins ?
delighted to meet you .
come , let' s sit down here .
what would you like ?
tea ?
coffee ?
coffee .
it' s wonderful how you keep the tension .
tension ?
suspense .
you really liked it ?
at the end of every chapter you are left guessing .
so , you were a friend of harry' s ?
i think his best .
except you , of course .
the police have a crazy notion that he was mixed up in some sort of a racket .
everyone in vienna is .
we all sell cigarettes and that kind of thing .
i tell you , i' ve done things that would have seemed unthinkable before the war .
once when i was hard up , i sold some tires on the black market .
i wonder what my father would have said .
i' m afraid the police meant more than that .
they get rather absurd ideas sometimes .
he' s somewhere now he won' t mind about that .
even so , i' m not going to leave it at this .
would you help me ?
i wish i could .
but , you know , i am an austrian .
i have to be careful with the police .
i' m afraid i can' t help you .
except with advice , of course .
advice .
we came out of his place like this ... and were walking this way .
a friend of his called to him from over there .
harry went across , and from up there came the truck .
it was just about here .
here ?
yes .
his friend and i picked him up , carried him across over here .
it was a terrible thing .
terrible .
we laid him down just about here .
and this is where he died .
even at the end , his thoughts were of you .
what did he say ?
i can' t remember the exact words , holly .
i may call you holly , mayn' t i ?
he always called you that to us .
he was anxious i should look after you when you arrived , to see that you got safely home , tickets , you know , and all that .
but he said he died instantaneously .
well , he died before the ambulance could reach us .
well , there was only you and this friend of his .
uh , who was he ?
a romanian .
mr. popescu .
i' d like to talk to him .
h he has left vienna .
uh , excuse me .
yes ?
did you know mr. lime well ?
mr. lime ?
yes .
you remember me .
u upstairs .
yes , i remember you .
who used to visit mr. lime ?
visit ?
eh [ speaking german ]
what did he say ?
he says he doesn' t know everybody .
excuse me .
who was at the funeral besides you ?
only his doctor , dr. winkel .
wasn' t there a girl there ?
some girl of the josefstadt theater .
you know what harry was .
you oughtn' t to speak to her .
it would only cause her pain .
not necessarily .
she' d probably want to help .
what' s the good of another postmortem ?
suppose you dig up something discreditable to harry ?
would you give me your address ?
i live in the russian sector .
but you' il find me at the casanova club every night .
one has to work the best way one can , you know .
what' s the name of this girl ?
i don' t know .
i don' t think i ever heard it .
you did mention the theater .
josefstadt .
but i still think it won' t do harry any good .
you' d do better to think of yourself .
i' il be all right .
of course .
i' m so glad i' ve met you .
a master of suspense !
such a good cover , i think .
number 8 , please .
mr. calloway' s compliments .
here' s the ticket for the plane tomorrow .
tell the major i won' t need it .
oh , porter , order me a ticket tonight for the josefstadt theater .
ah , mr. martins !
good evening , mr. crabbin .
he said i was to drive you to the airfield or the bus , whichever you prefer .
didn' t you hear mr. crabbin offer me the hospitality of the h. q. b. m. t. ?
i was a friend of harry lime .
afterwards .
uh , miss schmidt ?
oh , come in .
thank you .
sit down .
i enjoyed the play very much .
danke .
guten nacht .
guten nacht .
you were you were awfully good .
do you understand german ?
no , l excuse me .
i could follow it fine .
oh , yes .
perhaps harry told you about me .
my name is holly martins .
no , he never told me about his friends .
oh .
would you like some tea ?
someone threw me this packet last week .
thank you .
sometimes the british do instead of flowers , you know , on the first night .
that was a bouquet from an american .
would you rather have whiskey ?
oh , tea' s fine .
good .
i wanted to sell it .
oh , there is some tea left .
had you known him some time ?
yes .
i wanted to talk to you no , thank you .
i wanted to talk to you about him .
there' s nothing really to talk about , is there ?
nothing .
well , i saw you at the funeral .
i' m so sorry .
i didn' t notice much .
you were in love with him , weren' t you ?
i don' t know .
how can you know a thing like that afterwards ?
i don' t know anything anymore , except i want to be dead too .
some more tea ?
no , no tea .
would you like a cigarette ?
oh , american .
thank you .
i like them .
i was talking to another friend of harry' s , a baron kurtz .
do you know him ?
no .
he' s got a little dog .
oh , yes , yes .
don' t understand what harry saw in a fellow like that .
that was the man who brought me some money when harry died .
he said harry had been anxious at the last moment .
hmm .
he said he remembered me too .
seems to show he wasn' t in much pain .
dr. winkel told me that .
dr. winkel ?
who' s he ?
a doctor harry used to go to .
he was passing just after it happened .
his own doctor ?
yes .
well , were you at the inquest ?
yes .
they said it wasn' t the driver' s fault .
harry had often said what a careful driver he was .
he was harry' s driver ?
mm hmm .
well , uh , i don' t get it .
all of them there !
uh , kurtz , this romanian , uh , popescu , his own driver knocking him over , his own doctor just passing by .
no strangers there at all .
i know .
i' ve wondered about it a hundred times , if it really was an accident .
what difference does it make ?
he' s dead , isn' t he ?
but if it wasn' t an  [ woman ]
frau schmidt !
i must hurry .
they don' t like us to use the lights .
the porter saw it happen .
then why worry ?
look , do you know that porter ?
yes .
what' s he saying ?
he says it happened right down there .
happened , yes .
happened right down there .
you saw it ?
well , not saw , heard .
heard .
i heard the brakes .
and i got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side ... uh , josef , the josef
emperor josef statue .
why didn' t they bring him in the house ?
could he have been conscious ?
conscious ?
uh , was he was he still alive ?
ah , alive !
he couldn' t have been alive , not with his head in the way it was .
i was told that he did not die at once .
no , i mean that [ german ]
no , you
he was quite dead .
he was he was quite dead .
he was quite dead .
but this sounds crazy .
lf he was killed at once , how could he have talked about me and this lady here ?
why didn' t you say all this at the inquest ?
uh , it' s better not to be mixed up in things like this .
things like what ?
i was not the only one who did not give evidence .
who else ?
three men helped to carry your friend to the statue .
kurtz ?
yes .
the romanian ?
yes .
and ?
there was a third man .
he didn' t give evidence .
you mean the doctor ?
no , no , no .
he came later , after they carried him to the josef statue .
what did this man look like ?
i didn' t see his face .
he didn' t look up .
he was quite , uh , ordinary .
he he might have been ... just anybody .
just anybody .
hello ?
hello .
hello .
hello ?
who was that ?
i don' t know .
they didn' t answer .
but i was told there were only two men there .
you' ve got to tell your story to the police .
the police ?
why police ?
it' s nonsense !
it is all nonsense !
it was an accident
you don' t know it was an accident .
you only saw a dead man with three men carrying him .
i should have listened to my wife .
she said you were up to no good .
gossip .
suppose i take your evidence to the police ?
now , hold on .
i have no evidence .
l i saw nothing , i said nothing .
it' s not my business .
we' il make it your business .
hold on .
i have always liked you , but you must not bring this gentleman again .
you must go at once , please .
please !
please !
you shouldn' t get mixed up in this .
well , if i do find out something , can i look you up again ?
why don' t you leave this town ?
go home .
what is it ?
what' s she talking about ?
the police are searching my room .
what the devil ?
getting around , martins ?
oh , pinning things on girls now .
miss schmidt , i should like to see your papers , please .
don' t you give him anything .
thank you .
you were born in graz of austrian parents ?
yes .
paine .
hmm .
it' s very good , sir , isn' t it , eh ?
how much did you pay for this ?
i' m afraid i shall have to keep this for a while , miss schmidt .
how do you expect her to live without her papers ?
write her out a receipt .
give her a receipt for those letters too .
this way , miss .
i suppose it wouldn' t interest you to know that harry lime was murdered .
you' re too busy .
you haven' t even bothered to get the complete evidence .
must you take those ?
they' il be returned , miss .
they are private letters .
that' s all right , miss .
don' t worry .
we' re used to it .
like doctors .
there was a third man there .
i suppose that doesn' t sound peculiar to you .
i' m not interested in whether a racketeer like lime was killed by his friends or by accident .
the only important thing is that he' s dead .
i' m sorry .
tactful too , aren' t we , callaghan ?
calloway .
must you take those letters ?
yes , i' m afraid so .
they' re harry' s .
that' s the reason .
you won' t learn anything from them .
they' re only ... love letters .
there are not many of them .
they' il be returned to you , miss schmidt , as soon as they' ve been examined .
there' s nothing in them .
harry never did anything .
only a small thing once , out of kindness .
and what was that ?
you' ve got it in your hand .
major calloway ?
finished ?
yes .
okay .
you will have to come with us , miss schmidt .
you' re not locking her up .
go home , martins , like a sensible chap .
get the next plane .
as soon as i get to the bottom of this .
death' s at the bottom of everything , martins .
mind if i use that line in my next western ?
you can' t chuck me out .
here we are , miss .
your receipt for the letters .
i don' t want it .
well , i' ve got it when you want it , miss .
anything really wrong with your papers ?
they' re forged .
oh .
why ?
the russians would claim me .
i come from czechoslovakia .
what' d she say ?
only complaining about the way they behaved in her house .
give her some cigarettes .
uh , cigarettes , hmm ?
danke .
no , go ahead , take the
miss schmidt , ready ?
now , look ,
i' il straighten out all this nonsense about harry .
you' il be all right .
sometimes he said i laughed too much .
oh , what' s the name of that doctor ?
harry' s doctor ?
dr. winkel .
what do you want to see a doctor for ?
a bruised lip .
good .
laboratory , we' re coming right down .
you wait here , miss schmidt .
ls dr. winkel in ?
dr. winkel .
i' m sorry .
i don' t speak german .
nein .
please , won' t you say that i' m a friend of harry lime ?
bitte .
thank you .
bittesehr . ??
guten nacht .
dr. winkel ?
vinkel .
uh , dr. vinkel .
quite a collection of , uh ... collection .
yes .
ls that your dog ?
yes .
would you mind , mr. , uh
martins .
martins , coming to the point , please ?
thank you .
i have guests waiting .
we were both friends of harry lime .
i was his medical advisor .
i want to find out all i can .
find out ?
yeah , the details .
i can tell you very little .
he was run over by a car .
he was dead when i arrived .
who was with him ?
two friends of his .
you sure ?
two ?
quite sure .
could he have been at all conscious ?
i understand he was , yes , for a short time ... while they carried him across the road .
ln great pain ?
mmm , not necessarily .
could he have been capable of making plans ... for me and others just , just during those few moments ?
i understand he left some instructions before he died .
i cannot give an opinion .
i was not there .
my opinion is limited to the causes of death .
have you any reason to be dissatisfied ?
was it possible that his death ... might have been not accidental ?
could he have been
could he have been ... pushed , dr. winkel ?
vinkel .
i cannot give an opinion .
the injuries to the head and skull would have been the same .
major , may i see you for a moment , please ?
certainly , brodsky .
what is it ?
this forgery is very clever , and we are interested in this case .
have you arrested the girl ?
no , not yet .
please , keep this passport to yourself until i will make some inquiries .
will you , major ?
thank you .
yes , of course .
right , sit down , miss schmidt .
we' il send your letters and things back to you .
and my passport ?
we' il need that for a while .
what did he mean ?
you know as much as i do .
miss schmidt , you were intimate with lime , weren' t you ?
we loved each other .
do you mean that ?
do you know this man ?
i' ve never seen him .
joseph harbin .
no .
he works in a military hospital .
no .
it' s stupid to lie to me , miss schmidt .
i' m in a position to help you .
i' m not lying .
you' re wrong about harry .
you' re wrong about everything .
ln one of his letters , he asked you to telephone a good friend of his called joseph .
he gave you the number of the casanova club .
that' s where a lot of friends of lime used to go .
it wasn' t important .
what was the message ?
something about meeting harry at his home .
harbin disappeared the day you telephoned .
we' ve got to find him .
you can help us .
what can i tell you , but you' ve got everything upside down .
okay .
that american friend of yours is still waiting for you .
he won' t do you much good .
i thank you , miss schmidt .
we' il send for you when we want you .
hello , mr. martins .
i' ve been trying to get you at your hotel .
i' ve arranged that lecture for tomorrow .
well , what about ?
on the modern novel .
you remember what we arranged .
oh .
they want you to talk on the crisis of faith .
what' s that ?
oh , i thought you' d know .
you' re a writer .
but of course you do .
good night , old man .
i' ve forgotten my hat .
i' il let you know the time later .
mmm . ??
drink ?
whiskey .
two whiskeys .
zwei whisky .
how much ?
twenty shillings .
oh , they don' t take army money here .
how much did he say ?
harry ?
yes .
he moved his head , but the rest is good , isn' t it ?
good evening , miss schmidt .
good evening .
you' ve found out my little secret .
a man must live .
how goes the investigation ?
have you proved the policemen are wrong ?
not yet .
but you will .
our friend dr. winkel said you had called .
wasn' t he helpful ?
well , he was limited .
but mr. popescu is here tonight .
the romanian ?
yes , the man who helped carry him .
i thought he' d left vienna .
he' s back now .
well , i' d like to meet all of harry' s friends .
i' il bring him to you .
haven' t you done enough for tonight ?
the porter said three men carried the body , and two of them are here .
who are you lookin ' for now ?
shh .
shh .
don' t .
please don' t .
silly lookin ' bunch .
mr. popescu , mr. martins .
how do you do ?
any friend of harry is a friend of mine .
i' il leave you together .
good evening , miss schmidt .
you remember me ?
of course .
i helped harry fix her papers , mr. martins .
oh , you did ?
not a sort of thing i should confess to a stranger , but you have to break the rules sometimes .
humanity is a duty .
cigarette , miss schmidt ?
keep the pack .
i understand you were with harry
two double whiskeys .
it was a terrible thing .
i was just crossing the road to go to harry .
he and the baron were on the sidewalk .
maybe if i hadn' t started to cross the road , it wouldn' t have happened .
i can' t help blaming myself and wishing things had been different .
anyway , he saw me and stepped off the sidewalk to meet me .
and the truck
it was terrible , mr. martins .
terrible .
i' ve never seen a man killed before .
i think there was something funny about the whole thing .
funny ?
something wrong .
of course there was .
some ice for mr. martins .
you think so too ?
it was so terribly stupid ... for a man like harry to be killed in an ordinary street accident .
that' s all you meant ?
what else ?
who was the third man ?
i oughtn' t to drink it .
it makes me acid .
what man would you be referring to , mr. martins ?
i was told that a third man helped you and kurtz carry the body .
i don' t know how you got that idea .
you' il find all about it in the police report .
there was just the two of us , me and the baron .
who could have told you a story like that ?
the porter at harry' s place .
he was cleaning the window at the time .
and saw the accident ?
no , he didn' t see the accident , but he saw three men carrying the body .
why wasn' t he at the police inquiry ?
he doesn' t want to get involved .
you' il never teach these austrians to be good citizens .
it was his duty to give the evidence .
even so , he remembers wrong .
what else did he tell you ?
that harry was dead before you got him to that statue .
he probably knows a lot more than that .
somebody' s lying .
hmm , not necessarily .
the police say he was mixed up in some racket ?
oh , that' s quite impossible .
he had a great sense of duty .
your friend kurtz seems to think it was possible .
i understand how an anglo saxon feels .
the baron hasn' t traveled , you know ?
he seems to have been around a bit .
do you know a man called , uh , harbin ?
no .
joseph harbin .
joseph harbin ?
no .
that' s a nice girl , that , but she ought to go careful in vienna .
everybody ought to go careful in a city like this .
he will meet us at the bridge .
good .
hello ! ls it so very important for you ?
yes , it is .
i am not a bad man .
i' d like to tell you something .
tell me , how did the car
shh , shh .
come tonight .
my wife goes out .
all right , i' il come back , but  shh .
tonight .
does that mean come in ?
oh , yes , come in .
the porter' s going to talk to us tonight .
need we go through it all again ?
i can manage by myself .
you busy ?
just another part i' ve got to learn .
can i hear you ?
ln german ?
i can try .
ls it comedy or tragedy ?
comedy .
i don' t play tragedy .
do i , uh , read  well , you read this .
oh .
well , l [ speaking broken german ]
what' s that ?
uh , heurigen , i guess .
h e z t
oh , let me see .
no , no , that' s not the cue .
it means she has to sit down .
well , uh , frau hausman
no , no .
it' s no good .
bad day ?
it' s always bad around this time .
he used to look in around 6 : 00 .
i' ve been frightened .
i' ve been alone without friends and money .
but i' ve never known anything like this .
please talk .
tell me about him .
tell you what ?
oh , anything .
just talk .
where did you see him last , and what did you do ?
oh , we didn' t make much sense .
we drank too much .
once he tried to steal my girl .
where is she ?
oh , that was nine years ago .
tell me more .
well , it' s very difficult .
you knew harry .
we didn' t do anything very amusing .
he just made everything seem like such fun .
was he clever when he was a boy ?
he could fix anything .
what sort of things ?
oh , little things .
how to put your temperature up before exam .
the best crib .
how to avoid this and that .
he fixed my papers for me .
he heard the russians were repatriating people like me who came from czechoslovakia .
he knew the right person straightaway for forging stamps .
yeah .
when he was 14 , he taught me the three card trick .
that' s growing up fast .
he never grew up .
the world grew up around him , that' s all .
and buried him .
anna , you' il fall in love again .
don' t you see i don' t want to ?
i don' t ever want to .
come on out and have a drink .
why did you say that ?
seemed like a good idea .
it was just what he used to say .
well , uh , i didn' t learn that from him .
lf we have to see the porter , we' d better go .
what' s the hurry ?
can' t we talk quietly for a couple of minutes ?
i thought you wanted  a moment ago , you said you didn' t want to see the porter .
we' re both in it , harry .
holly .
i' m so sorry .
it' s all right .
you might get my name right .
you know , you ought to find yourself a girl .
his english is so very bad , we' il let him talk german .
lf you' il be good enough to trans  look .
that' s harry' s place , isn' t it ?
yes .
let' s go away .
what' s the matter ?
let' s not get into any more trouble .
wait here .

i' d better not see you again .
what are you going to do ?
i wish i knew .
be sensible .
tell major calloway .

oh , mr. martins .
it' s very urgent .
just get him on the telephone .
do you know his number ?
no , i don' t know his number .
i' il look it up for you .
ls there a car here ?
of course .
there' s one waiting for you .
never mind about the number .
take me to the headquarters
hold on !
i haven' t even told you where to take me yet !
driver !
driver !
slow down !
have you got orders to kill me ?
ah , ah , ah !
ah , mr. martins !
what a relief to see you .
i was beginning to think something had happened to you .
everything' s ready for you .
i was frantic in case you hadn' t got ... my message at the hotel .
porters out here are so unreliable .
we' re all set for a wonderful meeting .
you' il find the audience most appreciative .
oh , let me take your coat .
i' ve got it .
there' il be refreshments afterwards .
come along .
follow me .
well , here we are , ladies and gentlemen .
would you look after those ?
thank you .
would you like to sit there ?
that' s right .
i have much pleasure in introducing mr. holly martins from the other side .
well [ clears throat ]
bring the car and anyone else who would like to come .
don' t be long .
hmm .
yeah , well , l i suppose that is what i meant to say .
of course , of course .
do you believe , mr. martins , in the stream of consciousness ?
stream of consciousness ?
well , uh well , uh
well , uh  what author has chiefly influenced you ?
grey .
grey ?
what grey ?
zane grey .
that' s mr. martins ' little joke , of course .
we know perfectly well zane grey wrote what we call westerns .
cowboys and bandits .
mr. james joyce now , where would you put him ?
oh , uh , would you mind repeating that question ?
i said , where would you put mr. james joyce ?
ln what category ?
can i ask , is mr. martins engaged on a new book ?
yes .
it' s called the third man .
a novel , mr. martins ?
it' s a murder story .
i' ve just started it .
it' s based on fact .
why , it' s mr. popescu !
oh , very great pleasure to see you here .
as you know , mr. popescu is a very great supporter of one of our medical charities .
are you a slow writer , mr. martins ?
not when i get interested .
i' d say you were doing something pretty dangerous this time .
yeah ?
mixing fact and fiction .
should i make it all fact ?
why , no , mr. martins .
i' d say stick to fiction .
straight fiction .
i' m too far along with the book , mr. popescu .
haven' t you ever scrapped a book , mr. martins ?
never .
pity .
ladies and gentlemen , if there are no more questions ,
i think i can call the meeting officially closed .
that' s him .
who' s there ?
who is it ?
who is it ?
it' s all right .
it' s all right .
i told you to go away , martins .
this isn' t santa fe , i' m not a sheriff and you aren' t a cowboy .
you' ve been blundering around with the worst bunch of racketeers in vienna ,
harry' s friends , and now you' re wanted for murder .
put down drunk and disorderly too .
i have .
what' s the matter with your hand ?
parrot bit me .
oh , stop behaving like a fool , martins .
i' m only a little fool .
i' m an amateur at it .
you' re a professional .
you' ve been shaking your cap and bells all over town .
get me the harry lime file , and get mr. martins a whiskey .
i don' t need your drinks , calloway .
you will .
i don' t want another murder in this case , so you' re going to hear the facts .
you haven' t told me a single one yet .
have you ever heard of penicillin ?
well ?
ln vienna , there hasn' t been enough penicillin to go around .
stealing penicillin from the military hospitals , diluting it to make it go further , and selling it to patients .
do you see what that means ?
are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder ?
these were murders .
men with gangrened legs , women in childbirth , and there were children too .
they used some of this diluted penicillin against meningitis .
the lucky children died .
the unlucky ones went off their heads .
you can see them now in the mental ward .
that was the racket harry lime organized .
calloway , you haven' t shown me one shred of evidence .
we' re just coming to that .
paine , magic lantern show .
very good , sir .
paine' s one of your devoted readers .
he' s promised to lend me one of your books .
which one is it , paine ?
the lone rider of santa fe , sir .
that' s right .
i' d like to visit texas one day , sir .
come on , show me what you' ve got to show .
all right , paine ?
yes , sir .
paine , paine , paine .
i got them muddled .
it' s the new lot that' s just come in for mr. crabbin .
see this man here ?
a fellow called harbin , a medical orderly at the general hospital .
he worked for lime and helped to steal the stuff from the laboratories .
we forced him to give information to us which led us as far as kurtz and lime .
but we didn' t arrest them , as it might have spoiled our chances of getting the others .
next , paine .
i' d like a word with this orderly , harbin .
so would l .
well , bring him in .
i can' t .
he disappeared a week ago .
this is more like a mortuary than police headquarters .
we have better witnesses .
look here .
how could he have done it ?
seventy pounds a tube .
go back to the hotel , and do keep out of trouble .
i' il try and fix things with the austrian police .
you' il be all right in the hotel , but i can' t be responsible for you on the streets .
i' m not asking you to .
i' m sorry , martins .
i' m sorry too .
you still got that airplane ticket on you ?
we' il send one across to your hotel in the morning .
thank you .
excuse me .
get me austrian police headquarters .
can i have that woman' s passport ?
you know , the anna schmidt one .
oh ... we' re not going to pick her up for that , are we ?
what can we do ?
we have our instructions .
??
it' s me .
it' s me .
hello .
what is it ?
what' s happened to you ?
just came to see you .
come in .
i thought you were going to keep away .
are the police after you ?
i don' t know .
you' re drunk , aren' t you ?
a bit .
i' m sorry .
but i did want to say good bye before i pushed off .
i' m going back home .
why ?
it' s what you' ve always wanted all of you .
kitty ?
here , kitty .
kitty ?
here , kitty .
kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty .
don' t you want to play , kitty ?
come on .
sleepy ?
sleepy kitty ?
not very sociable , is he ?
no , he only liked harry .
what made you decide so suddenly ?
i , l brought you these .
they , they got a little wet .
what happened to your hand ?
a parrot
let it go .
have you seen calloway ?
lmagine a parrot nipping a man ?
have you ?
it' s oh , i , l
i' ve been saying good bye all over , you know .
he told you , didn' t he ?
told me ?
about harry .
do you know ?
i' ve seen major calloway today .
he is better dead .
i knew he was mixed up , but not like that .
i knew him for 20 years at least , i thought i knew him .
suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time ?
he liked to laugh .
seventy pounds a tube .
he wanted me to write for his great medical charity .
i' il put these flowers in the water .
perhaps i could have raised the price to 80 pounds for him .
oh , please .
for heaven' s sake , stop making him in your image .
harry was real .
he wasn' t just your friend and my lover .
he was harry .
well , don' t preach wisdom to me .
you talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners .
no .
i don' t know .
i' m just a hack writer who drinks too much ... and falls in love with girls .
you .
me ?
don' t be such a fool .
of course .
lf you' d rung me up and asked me were you fair or dark ... or had a moustache , i wouldn' t have known .
oh , i am leaving vienna .
i don' t care whether henry was murdered by kurtz or popescu ... or the third man or
whoever killed him , there was some sort of ... justice .
maybe i would' ve killed him myself .
a person doesn' t change because you find out more .
look .
i' ve got a splitting headache , and you stand there and just talk and talk and talk .
l i hate it .
that' s the first time i ever saw you laugh .
do it again .
there isn' t enough for two laughs .
i' d make comic faces ... and stand on my head and grin at you between my legs ... and tell all sorts of jokes .
i wouldn' t stand a chance , would i ?
well ... you did tell me i ought to find myself a girl .
what kind of a spy do you think you are , satchel foot ?
what are you tailing me for ?
cat got your tongue ?
come on out .
come out , come out , whoever you are .
step out in the light and let' s have a look at ya .
who' s your boss ?
harry .
harry !
i followed his shadow ... until , suddenly
well ?
this is where he vanished .
i see .
i suppose you don' t believe me .
no .
look .
i tell you
you don' t think i' m blind , do you ?
yes .
where were you when you saw him first ?
fifty yards right down there .
which side of the road ?
i was on that side .
his shadow was on that side .
and there are no turnings on either side .
what about the doorways ?
i tell you , i heard him running ahead of me !
yes , yes , yes .
and then he vanished out there , i suppose , with a puff of smoke and like a clap of
it wasn' t the german gin .
well , what' s this ?
where are we ?
it' s the main sewer .
runs right into the blue danube .
smells sweet , doesn' t it ?
we should have dug deeper than a grave .
you knew him , major ?
hmm .
yes .
yes .
joseph harbin .
medical orderly at the general hospital .
he used to work for harry lime .
joseph harbin ?
yes .
he' s the man i told you was missing .
next time we' il have a foolproof coffin .
fraulein schmidt ?
ja .
where are you taking me ?
lnternational police headquarters , just to check up .
i' m sorry , miss .
it' s orders .
we can' t go against the protocol .
i don' t even know what protocol means .
neither do i , miss .
mademoiselle , your lipstick .
thank you .
anna , what' s happened to you ?
all right .
keep out of this .
listen , i' ve got to talk to you .
i' ve just seen a dead man walking .
all right , chum .
get back .
i saw him buried .
but now i' ve seen him alive .
just a minute .
bring her in here .
you stay out here .
come in , miss schmidt .
now then , miss schmidt .
i' m not interested in your forged papers .
that' s purely a russian case .
when did you last see lime ?
two weeks ago .
i want the truth , miss schmidt .
we know he' s alive .
it is true , then .
joseph harbin' s body was found in the coffin .
what did you say ?
i' m sorry .
i said another man was buried in his place .
where' s harry ?
that' s what we want to find out .
i' m sorry .
i don' t seem able to understand anything you say . l
he is alive .
now this minute , he is doing something .
miss schmidt , we know he' s somewhere across the canal in the russian sector .
you may as well help us .
ln a few minutes ,
colonel brodsky will be questioning you about your papers .
tell me where lime is .
i don' t know .
lf you help me , i am prepared to help you .
martins always said you were a fool .
vienna is a closed city , miss schmidt .
he can' t get away .
right .
poor harry .
i wish he was dead .
he would be safe from all of you , then .
why , that' s you !
come up .
winkel , look who is here .
i want to speak to you , kurtz .
of course .
come up .
i' il wait here .
i don' t understand .
i want to talk to harry .
are you mad ?
all right .
i' m mad .
i' ve seen a ghost .
you tell harry i want to see him .
be reasonable .
come up and talk .
no , thank you .
i like the open .
tell him i' il wait by that wheel there .
or do ghosts only rise by night , dr. winkel ?
you got an opinion on that ?
hello , old man .
how are you ?
hello , harry .
well , well , they seem to be giving you quite some busy time .
well , listen .
i want to talk to you .
hmm , yes ?
talk to me ?
well , of course .
come on .
kids used to ride this thing a lot in the old days .
but they haven' t the money now , poor devils .
listen , harry .
i didn' t believe that
it' s good to see you , holly .
i was at your funeral .
that was pretty smart , wasn' t it ?
oh , the same old indigestion , holly .
these are the only things that help , these tablets .
these are the last .
can' t get ' em anywhere in europe anymore .
do you know what' s happened to your girl ?
hmm ?
she' s been arrested .
tough , very tough , but don' t worry , old man .
they won' t hurt her .
they' re handing her over to the russians .
what can i do , old man ?
i' m dead , aren' t i ?
you can help some .
holly , exactly who did you tell about me , hmm ?
i told the police .
unwise , holly .
and anna .
unwise .
did the , uh , police believe you ?
you don' t care anything at all about anna , do you ?
i' ve got quite a lot on my mind .
you wouldn' t do anything .
what do you want me to do ?
be reasonable .
you can get somebody else  do you expect me to give myself up ?
why not ?
it' s a far better thing that i do ... with the old limelight than follow the curtain
no .
you and i aren' t heroes .
the world doesn' t make any heroes
you' ve got plenty of contacts .
outside of your stories .
i' ve got to be so careful .
i' m only safe in the russian zone .
i' m only safe as long as they can use me .
as long as they can use you ?
i wish i could get rid of this thing .
so that' s how they found out about anna .
you told them , didn' t you ?
don' t try to be a policeman , old man .
what do you expect me to be ?
part of your  part ?
you can have any part as long as you don' t interfere .
i' ve never cut you out of anything .
yes , i remember when they raided the gambling joint , you knew a safe way out .
sure !
yeah , safe for you .
not safe for me .
old man , you never should have gone to the police , you know .
you ought to leave this thing alone .
have you ever seen any of your victims ?
you know , i never feel comfortable on these sort of things .
victims ?
don' t be melodramatic .
tell me .
would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever ?
lf i offered you 20, 000 for every dot that stopped , would you really , old man , tell me to keep my money ?
or would you calculate how many dots you could afford to spend ?
free of income tax , old man .
free of income tax the only way you can save money nowadays .
a lot of good your money will do you in jail .
that jail' s in another zone .
there' s no proof against me , besides you .
i should be pretty easy to get rid of .
pretty easy .
i wouldn' t be too sure .
i carry a gun .
i don' t think they' d look for a bullet wound after you hit that ground .
they dug up your coffin .
and found harbin ?
mm hmm .
pity .
holly , what fools we are talking to each other this way , as though i' d do anything to you or you to me .
you' re just a little mixed up about things in general .
nobody thinks in terms of human beings .
governments don' t .
why should we ?
they talk about the people and the proletariat .
i talk about the suckers and the mugs .
it' s the same thing .
they have their five year plans , and so have l .
you used to believe in god .
i still do believe in god , old man .
i believe in god and mercy and all that .
but the dead are happier dead .
they don' t miss much here , poor devils .
what do you believe in ?
oh , if we ever get anna out of this mess , be kind to her .
i think you' il find she' s worth it .
i wish i' d asked you to bring me some of these tablets from home .
holly , i' d like to cut you in , old man .
there' s nobody left in vienna i can really trust , and we' ve always done everything together .
when you make up your mind , send me a message .
i' il meet you anyplace , anytime .
and when we do meet , old man , it' s you i want to see , not the police .
remember that , won' t you ?
and don' t be so gloomy !
after all , it' s not that awful .
ln ltaly , for 30 years under the borgias , they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed .
but they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
ln switzerland , they had brotherly love .
they had 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce ?
the cuckoo clock .
so long , holly .
but look here , martins .
you can always arrange to meet him at , at some little cafe here in the international zone .
it would never work .
we' il never get him in the russian zone .
calloway , you expect too much .
oh , i know he deserves to hang .
you' ve proved your stuff , but 20 years is a long time .
don' t ask me to tie the rope .
okay .
forget it .
busy , major ?
what is it , brodsky ?
we have identified the girl .
here is her report .
i' ve questioned her .
we' ve got nothing against her .
we shall apply for her at the four power meeting tomorrow .
she has no right to be here .
i' ve asked your people to help with lime .
that' s a different case .
it is being looked into .
so long , major .
ln the last war , a general would hang his opponent' s picture on the wall .
he got to know him that way .
i' m beginning to know lime .
i think this would' ve worked , with your help .
what price would you pay ?
name it .
here we are .
you' il be all right here , miss .
i don' t understand major calloway . l
i expect he' s got a soft spot for you , miss .
why has he done all this ?
don' t you worry , miss .
you' re well out of things .
there we are , miss .
thank you .
you' ve been so kind .
well , i' il be saying good night .
good night , miss .
good bye .
are you going too ?
oh .
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to see you off .
see me off ?
from here ?
oh , i watched you onto the train , uh no harm in that , is there ?
how did you know i' d be here ?
i heard something about it at police headquarters .
have you been seeing major calloway again ?
of course not .
i don' t live in his pocket .
harry , what is it ?
for heaven sakes , stop calling me harry .
i' m sorry .
let' s go .
what' s on your mind ?
why did you hide here ?
hide ?
can' t a fellow have a drink ?
here .
it' il be cold on that train .
i shall be all right .
you send me a wire as soon as you are .
what' s going to happen ?
where is harry ?
he' s safe in the russian zone .
how do you know ?
well , i saw him today .
how is he ?
he can look after himself .
don' t worry .
did he say anything about me ?
tell me !
oh , the usual things .
ls something wrong ?
did you tell calloway about harry ?
of course i didn' t .
why should he help me ?
the russians will make trouble for him .
that' s his headache .
oh , anna !
his ?
why are you lying ?
we' re getting you out of here , aren' t we ?
i' m not going .
you' d
anna , don' t you recognize a good turn when you see one ?
you have seen calloway ?
what are you two doing ?
well , they , they asked me to help take him .
i' m helping .
poor harry .
poor harry .
poor harry ... wouldn' t even lift a finger to help you .
oh , you' ve got your precious honesty and don' t want anything else .
you still want him .
i don' t want him anymore .
i don' t want to see him , hear him , but he' s still a part of me .
that' s a fact .
i couldn' t do a thing to harm him .
oh , anna , why do we always have to quarrel ?
lf you want to sell your services , i' m not willing to be the price .
i loved him .
you loved him .
what good have we done him ... for love ?
look at yourself .
they have a name for faces like that .
calloway .
come in here .
there isn' t much time .
i want to get a plane out of here tonight .
so she talked you out of it .
gave me these .
a girl of spirit .
she' s right .
it is none of my business .
it won' t make any difference in the long run .
i' il get him .
well , i won' t have helped .
that' il be a fine boast to make .
well , i always wanted you to catch that plane , didn' t i ?
you all did .
i' d better see if there' s anyone still at the terminus .
you may need a priority .
mind if i drop off somewhere on the way ?
i' ve got an appointment .
it won' t take five minutes .
of course .
why don' t you come in too ?
you' re a writer .
it might interest you .
this is the biggest children' s hospital in vienna .
all the kids in here are the result of lime' s penicillin racket .
he' d had meningitis .
they gave it some of lime' s penicillin .
terrible pity , isn' t it ?
paine lent me one of your books .
oklahoma kid , i think it was .
i read a bit of it .
looks as if it' s gonna be pretty good .
what made you take up this sort of thing ?
been doing it for long ?
all right , calloway .
you win .
i never knew there were snake charmers in texas .
i said you win .
win what ?
i' il be your ... dumb decoy duck .
psst !
paine .
look , sir !
how much longer are you going to sit here ?
shall i go over there , sir ?
no .
no , leave them for a while .
mein herr , ballon ?
nein , danke .
nein .
ballon ?
go on .
hop it , scarper .
ballon , mein herr ?
all right , all right .
only one .
go on , scarper .
you should have gone .
how did you know i was here , anyway ?
from kurtz .
they have just been arrested .
but harry won' t come .
he' s not a fool .
yes , paine .
slip over there .
see what she' s up to .
right , sir .
don' t tell me you are doing all this for nothing .
what' s your price this time ?
no price , anna .
honest , sensible , sober , harmless holly martins .
holly .
what a silly name .
you must feel very proud to be a police informer .
harry , get away !
the police are outside !
quick !
anna .
sir , the back !
all right .
martins , get back !
harry !
ls that you ?
you' re through .
come out .

you might as well give up .
mr. martins , sir , get back , get back !
keep back , sir !
come back !
come back , sir !
martins !
martins !
be careful , martins .
don' t take any chances .
lf you see him , shoot !
what time is it ?
2 : 30 .
i' il have to step on it if you' re going to catch that plane .
calloway , can' t you do something about anna ?
i' il do what i can , if she' il let me .
wait a minute .
let me out .
well , there' s not much time .
one can' t just leave .
please .
be sensible , martins .
i haven' t got a sensible name , calloway .
