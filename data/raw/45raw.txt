let' s go .
come on .
oh , shit .
perimeter alarms are off .
killing video surveillance .
everyone' s in .
hallway alarms deactivated .
working on main gallery .
this way .
are you ready , hector ?
disarming security lasers .
there it is .
no , wait .
god damn it .
there' s a booby trap .
wait .
jose , don' t .
wait , no .
fuck .
shit .
go .
come on !
go .
hello ?
victor .
sandra .
i' m in barcelona .
my el greco was stolen last night .
what ?
i need you on a plane .
right now .
i' il be on the next flight over .
can' t believe i listened to you .
victor , i' m so sorry .
you should be .
what are you doing in my bed ?
bad dream .
careful , allie .
it' s heavy .
i' il get it .
daddy .
hey , my alley cat .
you' re getting too big for your old man .
hey .
hi , thanks for doing this .
okay .
so , maria' s going to pick her up from school everyday ... and stay with her until you get home from work .
and there' s a week' s worth of microwave dinners in the freezer ... and all of her favorite snacks are in the fridge .
can we watch scary movies ?
no dice .
absolutely not .
al , will you do mommy a favor and go up and get my jacket for me , please ?
what ?
i' m not gone a month here and you changed the locks .
berate me when i get back .
so , you' re off to your old stomping grounds .
it' s not what you think .
i have to go smooth victor boyd' s feathers .
this whole thing is my fault .
i' m the one who convinced him to hang that painting in barcelona .
if it weren' t for me , it' d be still hanging in his bathroom in the hamptons .
victor boyd .
you know i hate that rich asshole .
50 cents .
for what ?
mommy says whenever you swear , you got to give me 50 cents .
50 cents .
is that right ?
what the hell is this ?
now it' s $1 .
you' re killing me , kid .
how is this ?
victor boyd , that rich ... jerk .
dork is fine , too .
dork ?
give me a kiss .
one more .
i got you .
so , he gets this outrageously expensive trophy ripped off ... and you got to go globetrotting to the other side of the earth ?
shame just for a painting .
it' s not just a painting .
it' s an el greco .
some people dedicate their entire lives to studying them .
dedicate .
waste .
let' s not split hairs here .
cab' s here .
i am gonna miss you so much .
i love you , mommy .
love you too , honey .
i' il call you in a day or two .
it' s the third painting stolen in spain in a month .
and all the robberies have been clean .
no clues , no leads , no suspects .
i' m sorry , victor .
i just thought exhibiting your el greco here would increase the market value .
let me tell you about value .
these paintings are my children .
this collection is my life .
i hired you because i thought you felt the same way about art .
this exposition will be over in two weeks .
that' s how long you have ... to find my christ , or i' il find another agent .
inspector , i' d like you to meet sandra walker .
she' s my agent from new york .
inspector rubio will be in charge of the case .
how do you do ?
mr. boyd claims you are an expert on the world market .
that you know all international buyers .
i know most of them .
any suspects yet ?
we' re checking on raymond douglas .
i know raymond douglas .
he collects illuminated medieval art .
he' s not your guy .
i told you she was good .
good luck .
thank you .
don' t let me down .
shall we go in ?
yes .
one doesn' t exactly sell an el greco in the street , you know .
our investigation is concentrating on potential buyers .
you know their tastes , mrs. walker .
make a list .
you' il be working with our art expert .
a professor from the barcelona institute of fine arts , named ...
daniel ?
yeah ?
sandra .
i can' t believe it .
daniel and i studied here at the institute together .
well , then you' il have no problem working together .
let me know if you need anything .
thank you .
they told me the new york expert' s name was walker ...
my husband' s name .
well , congratulations .
it' s good to see you .
how did you get involved in this ?
the police needed a consultant .
i happen to know all the private owners in the city .
most of them have let me study their collections for the institute .
well , where do we start ?
it was close , but ...
no , sir .
it won' t happen again .
we' il be more careful next time .
i promise .
okay , to us , cheers .
to all the money .
yeah .
you fucked up , jose .
i just got a little nervous .
i thought all the alarms were off .
come on .
it was a mistake .
shit .
do you know the kind of people we are working for ?
do you know how they punish failure ?
repeat after me .
okay .
no more ...
no more ... ... mistakes . ... mistakes .
i promise .
drink .
hiroshi yakamura .
billionaire .
founder of kodo industries .
he collects 16th and 17th century european art ... and has a particular affection for el greco .
maria teresa alcalde .
one of the wealthiest ... and most ruthless businesswomen in europe .
interpol accused her of illegally obtaining a rembrandt in 1989 .
she claimed it was a misunderstanding ... and returned the painting to the dutch government .
and , finally , in my opinion , our main suspect .
dimitri maximov , head of the baltic drug cartel .
maximov cultivates an image of a european intellectual .
he likes french wine , cuban cigars , russian poetry .
at the end of the cold war , maximov looted many of the museums ... that were previously under soviet control .
men like maximov see art as a trophy , not as a living thing .
good .
well , these are the 12 buyers identified ... by mr. marin and mrs. walker as potential suspects .
i want to know everything about them .
is that all ?
wellington' s barcelona is having our annual auction next week ... and all of our suspects are confirmed bidders .
and daniel and i will be attending that .
excellent .
okay .
thank you both .
lights .
back to work .
we have many new leads to pursue .
we make a pretty good team .
we always did .
hello .
hey , i' ve been trying to reach you .
i was just about to call you .
how is everything going ?
great .
we are making breakfast .
she' s not giving you any trouble , is she ?
no way .
not my little angel .
hey , big al ... put some cornflakes on it , it' s yummy .
listen , the bank called .
something about a deposit cleared .
it must have been a pretty big sum of money for them to call you personally .
what deposit ?
i haven' t received any checks lately .
i wouldn' t know , seeing that we don' t have that joint bank account any more .
it' s probably a computer glitch .
i' il take care of it in the morning .
sure you don' t want me to take care of it ?
bruce , it' s my problem .
i' il fix it .
okay , just asking .
all right , i' il talk to you later , okay ?
bye .
how are things in paradise ?
my husband , the alpha male , trying to control things .
say , partner , all this detective work has made me hungry .
i don' t know .
there' s a lot of work to do .
come on .
a nice dinner .
some good vino .
we' il talk about old times .
just talk .
okay .
i can' t believe you brought me here .
i hoped it would bring back fond memories .
it does .
it' s hard to believe it' s been 10 years .
yeah .
i keep expecting to run into claudio or miranda .
did i mention tonia became a hairdresser ?
no .
we had a lot of fun , daniel .
we' re all scattered all over the world .
none of us paint anymore .
you were so good .
why did you stop ?
now that you mention it , i think you' re right .
i was .
no .
but not great .
but no regrets .
i love teaching .
besides , you were the one with real talent .
no .
what happened ?
family .
career .
are you happy at least ?
i was , at first .
very .
but lately , bruce and i have been having problems .
it' s tough for a new york police officer .
he sees reality on the street every day ... and how can he understand something as ethereal as art ?
and how do i explain to him that it' s not just a hobby ?
it' s something you do with all of your heart ... or not at all .
we' ve been separated for about a month now .
well , i' m very sorry .
look , sandra .
i want you to know that if any of this makes you uncomfortable ...
any of what ?
working with me .
you don' t make me uncomfortable , daniel .
it' s good to have a friend .
okay , enough about me .
what about you ?
any special lady in your life ?
there was .
once .
and ?
what happened ?
she was offered a job in new york and chose her career over me .
imitating the great masters is a first step in developing your craft .
salvador dali learned to replicate all classic art ... before he formed his own unique style .
hi .
hey , class , we have a visitor .
this is sandra walker .
you' d better be nice to her .
she could have a significant impact on your careers .
there' s a lot of talent in this class .
but then again , they have a very gifted teacher .
no .
a teacher is only as good as his students .
the auction is in an hour .
yeah .
let me get my jacket .
toni , please take over .
okay .
see you .
bye .
sir lawrence stanton .
andre buchart .
oliver roughchild , gonzalo ...
sheikh al ahmad , senora alcalde .
that proxy bidder is on the phone with yakamura .
a rogue' s gallery of suspects .
but no maximov .
maybe he' s not our guy .
oh , no .
you' ve got to be kidding me .
victor .
sandra .
why didn' t you tell me you were coming today ?
i could have put together a portfolio for you .
actually , miss yee of sotheby' s is assisting me today .
okay .
any news on my christ ?
we' re doing the best we can , victor .
one week down .
one week to go .
i guess i' d better start looking for a new career .
maximov .
quite a collection .
have a favorite ?
this one .
early luis tristan .
somebody has already bought it .
some men are attracted to that which they cannot possess .
mrs ...
sandra walker .
wellington' s .
dimitri maximov .
baltic industries .
pleasure .
wellington' s .
it so happens i' m looking for fresh talent .
my last agent displeased me .
i fired her .

victor boyd .
although , as you can see at the moment , that' s an open question .
my , my .
it appears we are both available .
we should meet sometime .
i can show you our new acquisitions .
ready ?
okay .
let' s do it .

sandra , wait .

i can' t quite read the license plate .

we' ve got company .
all right .
lose them .
oh , shit .
oh , my god .
no .
please , my car .
hey , sandra , are you ...
sandra ?
oh , my god .
sorry about your car .
it' s only an object .
a very expensive one but still an object .
i' m sorry about your head .
it' s no great loss .
i hardly ever use it .
the doctor said he will release you today on one condition .
no more driving .
thank you for being here .
mommy .
what a surprise .
it' s so good to see you .
we flew on an airplane .
and you brought flowers .
that was daddy' s idea .
i wanted to bring candy .
what are you guys doing here ?
we came to take you home .
i can' t leave now .
daniel needs my help .
sandra has been a vital part of our investigation .
i' m sure the police department would hate to lose her .
right .
bruce walker .
daniel marin .
alison walker .
how do you do ?
charmed .
have you ever tasted crema catalana , alison ?
no ?
come with me , you will love it .
we' il go to the cafeteria while mommy and daddy talk , okay ?
so you' re working with your ex boyfriend ?
daniel and i are just friends .
i can' t leave because i' m right in the middle of this case .
and on thursday , we are gonna meet with the prime suspect .
who' s that ?
dimitri maximov .
the russian mobster ?
yes .
babe , are you kidding me ?
this guy has killed more people than the plague .
no way .
wrap it up .
you told me you were coming here to baby sit this victor boyd .
let' s go .
home .
no .
for the first time in a long time , i feel like i' m doing something important .
it' s my decision .
i' m staying .
any evidence that the stolen paintings are on board ... will help us to get a warrant .
what' s wrong with you ?
this guy is an animal .
maximov lives in total fear of rival gangs .
what choice do we have ?
let me tell you something .
once we had a guy that worked on the inside as a courier for maximov .
he sampled the merchandise one time too many .
by the time we caught up with him ... he was sitting in a chair with his balls marinated in a bottle of vodka .
you' re not going in there .
i' m going .
you' re not going in there .
enough .
you' re out of your jurisdiction here .
please .
you okay ?
yes , i' m fine .
are you sure you wanna do it ?
yes .
yeah .
i know .
okay .
here we go .
mrs. walker .
ravishing .
as usual .
forgive me .
an influential man makes persistent enemies .
she' s okay .
my wife says you' re a professor .
are you an artist , too ?
those who can' t do , teach " ?
i hope your appreciation of fine things ... extends beyond art .
this sherry comes from the region of seville .
exquisite bouquet .
i see you like my samson and delilah .
i do .
i like rembrandt' s version much better .
i like that .
many try to flatter me .
i value honesty .
deceit , on the other hand ...
take delilah ... she thinks she' s clever , betraying samson .
stealing the source of his power .
but samson had the last laugh .
delilah ended up in the temple ruins , crushed ... a pulp of flesh and blood .
fitting end for a traitor , don' t you think ?
i do .
i also think that this is a very good copy , dimitri .
was it taken from the national gallery ?
actually , the national gallery has a copy .
this is the original .
really ?
that' s a start .
do you think i' m bragging ?
no .
i' m not like other men , sandra .
when i desire something beautiful , i take it .
well , let' s get back to business .
shall we ?
what are you offering ?
security .
more .
insurance .
more .
exclusive service .
i can have your services exclusively ?
lf you like .
very much .
no rest for the wicked .
no .
there isn' t .
excuse me .
okay .
i' m in way over my head here .
i' m gonna find the d. h. and get out .
d. h. ?
what' s that ?
antique art is sensitive to temperature conditions .
maximov didn' t go through all the trouble to steal the el grecos to let them rot .
he' il keep a dehumidifying chamber handy .
i think i found it .
it' s empty .
no more games .
i' m sorry ?
i know why you are here .
you can' t keep any secrets from me .
jesus christ .
he is on to her .
i can see right through you .
you are a spy .
we got to go in there now .
you hear me ?
wait .
i' m going in .
quiet .
idiot .
my apologies .
i never get so emotional , but it' s beluga .
a taste ?
sure .
thank you .
why did you call me a spy ?
i know who sent you .
victor boyd .
hand on my heart , victor did not send me .
lying insults us both .
victor ... wants to know what paintings i' il be bidding on next ... so he can steal them from me .
can you blame him ?
he did have his el greco stolen recently .
he should be careful .
any one of his employees with knowledge ... of his collection and his security systems might just be willing ... to sell that information if the price were right .
yuri .
show this traitor out .
i' m just not sure it' s him .
you' re the one who said maximov' s an animal .
he is .
i' m just not sure he' s responsible for this .
look , mommy .
you wanna talk ?
about ?
us .
what' s there to talk about ?
you said you wanted your space , i said i wanted mine .
i just thought it might not be a bad idea if we tried .
hello .
daniel .
hola .
i' ve been trying to call you .
any news ?
no , it' s okay .
you didn' t interrupt anything .
is she talking to her old boyfriend again ?
what ?
where did you hear that ?
women' s intuition , daddy .
jesus christ .
50 cents .
you know , now that you wiped me out ...
you might at least buy me an ice cream .
okay .
come with me .
let' s go , you little thief .
hey , i' m selling this kid .
big al .
your favorite .
vanilla bean .
yum yum .
when are you coming home ?
i' m working on that , babe .
hopefully soon .
why did you leave ?
sometimes when people are married , they go through phases ...
like when you get happy and sad .
right now mommy and daddy are going through a little bit of a sad phase .
but that doesn' t mean that i love her any less , or you , too .
trust me , i' m doing my best to make things right .
okay ?
good .
i' m tired of being the man of the house .
is that right ?
if i slit your throat right now , sandra walker ... it will take you 90 seconds to die .
a minute and a half of knowing that your life is about to end .
and there' s nothing you can do but watch .
stop helping the cops .
stop harassing people .
go home .
this is your only warning .
are you all right ?
i' m okay .
yes .
mommy .
go .
what' s going on ?
god damn it .
that was too close .
this guy is crazy .
fuck him .
let' s go .
get up .
let' s go .
you two okay ?
yes , we' re okay .
what' s the word on the plates ?
we ran them .
the owner reported it stolen from a disco in sitges three days ago .
maximov must have had those men follow her from the yacht .
you' ve got to bring him in , inspector .
we' ve filed for a search warrant .
to arrest him now without evidence would devastate our case .
i' m sorry .
you' re sorry ?
you' re sorry .
this is over .
you understand ?
you wanna put yourself in danger , that' s fine ...
i' m not gonna let you put our daughter at risk .
come on .
she was safe in new jersey .
if anyone has put her in danger , it' s you .
sandra is right .
now that maximov' s men have seen her , alison could be in jeopardy .
perhaps you should go home .
perhaps you should stick to the paintbrushes .
where are you going ?
we' il be at the hotel .
mr. and mrs. vidal , nice to see you .
thank you for coming .
this is my wife ana .
hello , ana .
and my daughter , gabriela .
hello .
very beautiful .
good to see you , mr. and mrs. puig .
you' ve met my wife ana ?
yes .
how are you ?
it' s been such a ...
hello .
dr. and mrs. phillips .
so nice to see you .
i' m very glad you were able to make it .
this is my wife ana and my daughter ...
you sure ?
alarms are off ?
boss says so .
they wouldn' t want a guest to accidentally trigger them .
haven' t heard from you in a while , jordi .
i thought you' d forgotten me .
no man could ever forget you .
we' re wired .
he' s in .
remember , i can only interrupt the beams for a few seconds .
three , two , one .
now .
i' m so sorry .
i was adamant this painting stay in catalonia .
call it a matter of personal honor .
what the ...
hector ?
shit .
we' ve been made .
where the fuck are you , hector ?
fuck .
there he is .
son of a bitch .
go .
unbelievable .
it was daring .
i' il give them that .
ripping off one of the richest men in spain in the middle of a party .
probably guessed the alarm system would be down .
was the daughter any help ?
yeah , sure .
she gave us a detailed description of the waiter .
jordi pons .
you know , there' s thousands of them .
senor duran bought the painting at an auction in 2001 ... after a heated bidding war with an anonymous buyer .
i just got off the phone with wellington' s .
guess who the anonymous buyer was ?
maximov ?
when i desire something beautiful , i take it .
his own words .
great job , sandra .
so , you have maximov on tape bragging he has a stolen painting ... in his boat .
now this .
probable cause ?
we' il get our search warrant today .
put together a dossier ... with all the valuable stolen art in the last five years ... and help my men identify the paintings .
we might not find the el grecos .
but if we uncover so much as a stolen postage stamp ...
maximov is finished .
come on , partner .
okay .
here' s another one .
he is risen by andrei rublev .
stolen from the ukrainian people' s museum in ' 99 .
maximov' s cartel was spreading into the ukraine that year .
what a shame , all these paintings .
food' s here .
hungry ?
i' il wash up .
what' s this ?
nothing .
the food will get cold .
daniel , i know your style .
you are painting again ?
no , don' t look .
it' s not ready , okay ?
no , it' s ...
okay .
it' s great .
you really think so ?
i could sell this .
there' s a patron .
he likes my work .
we are talking about an exhibition overseas .
it only takes one sale to start a career .
it' s fantastic .
why haven' t you mentioned this before ?
superstition .
afraid to jinx it .
someone with your talent has nothing to be afraid of .
no , you were the good one .
remember ?
no .
what would you do to it ?
no .
please .
why not ?
yeah .
why not ?
no .
come on , please .
look , here .
i insist .
come on , don' t think , just let yourself go .
okay .
that' s it .
come on .
where are we going ?
some fresh air .
you know hector ?
hector ?
yes .
he owes me money .
you know him ?
yeah .
i got to catch him right now .
let' s catch him .
come on .
i wish ...
i wish you never left .
come on .
i got to go .
thanks for the ride .
you go ?
yes , i have to go .
you sure ?
thanks for the ride .
in case you change your mind , here' s my card .
sandra .
oh , my god .
are you okay ?
go .
but ...
go .
yuri .
ilya .
what the devil ?
sandra .
maximov is dead .
his boat was burnt .
what happened ?
as your husband pointed out , maximov had many enemies .
it looks like they finally caught up .
no one could have imagined it would end this way .
who says it' s over ?
the paintings and the culprit have been destroyed .
case closed .
and the kid that got blown up last night .
what' s that ?
spontaneous combustion ?
mrs. walker .
have you ever seen this document ?
it' s a fax from my office .
yeah .
dated four days before mr. boyd' s el greco was stolen .
describing its exact location in the museum and all security precautions .
addressed to dimitri maximov .
where did you get it ?
from a letter left for me with the duty officer .
it also contains a bank statement ... indicating a recent deposit was made in your account ... for the amount of $200, 000 . $200, 000 ?
that' s a mistake .
5 % of the painting' s worth .
yeah .
it could be a mistake .
or a finder' s fee .
wait a second .
i' d like to ask you a few questions .
i don' t think so .
get your stuff now .
we' re going straight to the american consulate .
i have nothing to hide .
i want to stay and clear this up .
what , you can' t tell when you' re being set up ?
set up ?
what do you base that on ?
why don' t you check the explosives from maximov' s boat ... with the kid who got killed last night .
i bet they match .
why would maximov' s enemies want to kill some boy ?
that' s my point exactly , ace .
mr. walker , please .
there won' t be any questions without a lawyer present .
you understand ?
none .
bruce , please don' t make a scene .
i' m going to clear this up .
okay ?
i' m gonna handle this .
after you .
so , we' re gonna get paid soon ?
very soon .
good .
i' m putting my share in the bank for my son .
he' s two months old now .
last night ...
i noticed some of the explosives were missing ... and now hector is gone ...
like jose .
yet you' re still here .
i figure a two way cut is better than four anyway .
maybe you figured a one way cut is better than two .
sorry , cesar , winner takes all .
what are you doing here ?
you' re the one who said if i ever changed my mind .
who are you ?
and don' t tell me you' re an old friend of hector' s .
i should call the police .
i am the police .
i need to know more about this kid , hector .
he was just a customer .
he was into extreme sports , right ?
yeah .
what kind ?
everything .
rock climbing , paragliding , scuba diving .
do you know any of his friends ?
he used to shop with a guy named jose .
jose ?
how do i get in touch with him ?
listen , honey .
you wanna get implicated in this ?
yeah .
i didn' t think so .
don' t come back .
so , you' ve known about this deposit for two weeks ... and you never once called your bank to verify ?
i' ve been busy .
had i known about the amount , of course i would have called .
have you recovered my el greco ?
tell me you found it , sandra .
victor , i' m sorry .
mr. boyd , please .
come in .
i' m here to see jose bassols .
my son was killed .
jose' s dead ?
yes .
my youngest , javier , he was born with curvature of the spine .
an operation could cure him ... but the money ...
jose always said he would find it .
that' s hector .
hector diaz .
this is my son .
they did many crazy things .
you know the others ?
cesar gomez .
this is fernando manes .
i didn' t like him .
his eyes never smiled .
you know where i might find them ?
the institute .
they are all art students .
victor .
if you' re guilty i' il spare no expense at destroying you .
bruce walker , u. s. immigration .
you got a student here who applied for a visa .
i got to check him out .
okay ?
don' t worry , it' s fine .
all the new beefed up security since 9l11 .
his name is cesar gomez .
what ?
no address ?
that' s odd .
you' il have to speak to his counselor .
who' s that ?
daniel marin .
do me a favor .
check out another one for me , okay ?
i thought you said only one .
that was for a visa .
these others are for green cards , okay ?
fernando manes .
m a n e s.
hector diaz .
daniel marin .
jose bassols .
b a s s o l s.
son of a bitch .
i' m not saying it' s you .
but it fits .
why not ?
a frustrated artist ... tired of seeing other people' s paintings sell , while her own art languished .
i gave up painting when i got married .
and i' ve never regretted my decision .
haven' t you ?
that' s it .
i' ve done everything i can to convince you that i' m innocent .
now i want to speak to my consulate .
certainly .
you' re not under arrest , mrs. walker .
good .
not yet .
but if i were you , i wouldn' t leave barcelona .
he actually thinks i' m guilty .
you want me to take you back to the hotel ?
no , i think i need some time alone , to think .
i' il get a cab .
jesus christ , sandy .
you almost gave me a heart attack .
what the hell are you doing in here ?
i left some papers here the other night .
it' s okay .
he' s working with prof. marin and i.
how did you get in here ?
i had a key .
what are you doing ?
trying to find evidence your boyfriend set you up .
okay .
first , he' s not my boyfriend .
and second , what the hell are you talking about ?
the kid that got killed last night , hector ?
he was one of daniel' s students .
daniel has thousands of students , bruce .
hector and all three of his buddies were also daniel' s students ... and they were all trained in extreme sports .
bruce , jealousy has completely warped your mind .
tell me something .
how did the thieves get into the museum the other night ?
through the roof .
that' s right .
and at duran' s mansion , they just flew off of some cliff ?
how about the auction ?
they climbed down the side of the building .
what does all this prove ?
it proves that they had the training and the ability ... to pull something like this off .
daniel is using them , just like he' s using you .
that doesn' t make any sense , because daniel has been working ... with me day and night to help me solve this .
he' s been working to set you up , sandy .
just like he set up maximov .
where are these kids ?
i want to speak to them .
good luck .
it ain' t gonna be easy , ' cause two of them ... are already dead .
oh , god .
this boy was at the auction .
he' s the one who spilled the wine on me .
daniel pretended not to know him .
i happen to know all the private owners in the city .
he knew all the el greco owners .
he' d been in their homes , so he knew the security systems .
... in my opinion , our main suspect .
he' s the one who pointed us to maximov .
maximov must have had those men follow her from the yacht .
and made us think that maximov' s men ... were the ones who threatened me in the park .
salvador dali learned to replicate all classic art ... before he formed his own unique style .
he had his students replicate the masters ... and put them in maximov' s boat .
the paintings and the culprit have been destroyed .
case closed .
why didn' t i think to have those fragments carbon dated .
if we can find the original paintings , we are home free , babe .
are you painting again ?
don' t look .
it' s not ready .
humidity .
how could i have been so blind ?
is that it ?
that' s one of them .
bad news .
the americans are here .
do you want me to take care of it ?
no .
wait , don' t hurt anyone , okay ?
i have a better way .
thank god .
i thought they were lost forever .
i can' t wait to see the look on victor' s face .
rubio owes you an apology , big time .
he does .
we make a pretty good team .
always did .
i' m very glad you' re here .
you' re my girl .
nothing' s ever gonna change that , right ?
the story of my life .
hello .
i understand you have something precious of mine .
so i was forced to take something precious of yours .
hi , mommy .
alison .
are you okay ?
of course she' s okay .
we' re sitting here watching tv .
where' s the baby sitter ?
i sent her home .
i swear to god if you lay one hand on my daughter .
what do you think i am ?
i won' t hurt her .
just do as i say .
met me at el tibidabo in one hour .
bring the paintings .
come alone .
no cops .
and especially , no husband .
hello ?
come with me .
don' t be frightened .
everything will be okay .
let' s go .
the paintings ?
damn .
go .
get rid of him .
go .
is it worth it , daniel ?
threatening a child ?
you left me no choice .
if i hadn' t taken her , you would have gone to the police .
what does it matter ?
you' re finished anyway .
no .
without the paintings , they have no evidence .
stay here .
come on .
how can you live with yourself ?
your students are dead .
that was all fernando' s doing .
i swear .
i didn' t find out until it was too late .
i never meant for things to turn out this way .
why did you do it ?
the money ?
no .
a career .
i know i can be an artist .
and this is my last chance .
and now with my patron' s help , i might stop teaching and ...
who is this mystery patron , daniel ?
doesn' t matter now anyway .
like you said .
no evidence .
alison , run .
mommy .
bruce .
daddy .
you .
both of you .
come here .
it was you ?
all along ?
that' s what i love about you , sandra .
you are quick .
you stole your own painting ... so they wouldn' t suspect you when you stole the others .
so you recruited daniel and his students ?
and got me to come to barcelona so you could frame me for it ?
you' re my scapegoat .
the police are very tenacious .
and the best way to close a case is to give them a culprit .
all this for a bunch of stupid paintings .
why ?
why ?
because human life is temporary , sandra .
these paintings ... are forever .
daniel .
i' il take care of these loose ends .
we have the paintings .
they can' t prove a thing .
i mean , there' s no need ...
they know , daniel .
that' s enough .
they are liabilities .
daniel .
please don' t do this .
you' re not this person .
i know you .
don' t be a fool , man .
think of your future .
your immortality .
i won' t let you do this , victor .
now get the paintings .
now .
or i' il shoot the child first .
you don' t wanna see your daughter die .
all right .
move .
all right .
good girl .
now hand them over .
you want your paintings , victor ?
go get them .
no .
allie , run .
no .
bruce , honey , are you okay ?
yeah .
mommy , can we go home now ?
yes , sweetheart .
we' re gonna go home .
jesus christ , i' m shot .
50 cents .
