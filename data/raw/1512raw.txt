let me tell you a story .
a fairy tale .
kinda .
about a bunch of tooth fairies who lost their magic ... .. and the adventure we all had to get it back .
it all started last christmas , ... .. when i was about to break the world land speed record .
captain tom wallit is cleared and ready for takeoff .
i dedicated that historic moment to my mother and father ... .. and to the memory of my sister tolly , who had just recently been ... .. eaten by bears .
tommy ?
tommy ?
what are you doing ?
keepin ' an eye on your sister ?
yeah , mom .
so i lied about the bears .
but a boy can dream .
harsh .
card' s declined .
really ?
no problem , i' il just ...
i' il write out a cheque .
sorry .
can' t do it .
you' re the wall of shame , lady .
the wall of what ?

sorry , dear , can' t help you .
but ...
turn it down or i' il kick it in !
come on , tol .
look , lady , do you know what we' ve been through ?

you don' t care about them .
you' re just scared people will hate you .
the only one you' ve cared about this whole time is you .
it' s not true .
the money .

oh , what' s the use ?
no money means no christmas , no teeth , no us .
we might as well just fade away .
come on !
where' s your spirit ?
ahhh !
remember when you did easter duty after eating 400 pounds of fudge ?
or the time your belt broke ... .. so you bored that boy back to sleep with the story of your life .
sir , you' d better have a look .
we' re done for !
hunters !
they' re coming !
this wouldn' t be happening if we still had ... magic .
where are we going ?
my house .
first time i ever have friends over and it has to be like this .
now arriving , ... .. fairy hunters .
the kids .
the kids !
showtime !
mom !
dad !
secure the exits .
gut the joint .
is it getting hot in here or is it just me ?
a talking giant rabbit .
tommy , what' s going on ?
i know you .
you used to put your mother' s bridgework under the pillow .
don' t you know how greedy that is ?
i call it initiative .
oh ho ho ho !
who are you , the cheesecake fairy ?
mr plug , on behalf of the children of the world ... .. and all that is decent and good in the universe , ... .. i demand that you leave at once .
zip it , fuzzball .
you bet .
i' il ... be over here ... .. if anyone needs me .
who' s the wacko ?
i' m the easter bunny' s evil twin .
the tooth fairy' s ugly stepsister .
i' m roadkill to reindeer , sun lamps to snowmen .
i am ... the anti claus .
knock it off , plug !
mrs c ?
she' s back !
and she' s bad .
run , plug .
while you still can .
ooh .
scary .
or , as my colleague here would say , ...
aaaaaarrrgghh !
what are you doing here ?
i' ve come to help , old friend .
but why' d you leave us in the first place ?
because the world had got greedy .
magic didn' t matter any more ; money did .
but what i didn' t realise is ... .. that there are a few loving and generous spirits ... .. still alive in this world .
all right , lady .
you wanna help ?
prove it .
very well .
i' ve got your money .
the garbage men , they work for me .

that is a long way up .
ok , is there another way out ?
hold on .
he' s burying us alive !
i know there' s a way out .
you don' t know anything .
help me out here , lady !
well , ... there is a way out .
you fly .
poppycock !
this is for you to do , for the ones you love .
magic is love , and wishes , and wanting to help other people .
and it' s here .
deep inside .
like a kidney ?
hello .
sceptical examiner ?
you guys want the exclusive of a lifetime ?
send your best man , and tell him to bring his camera .

the sceptical examiner was right .
you' re just a big fat liar .
you ...
you worthless , ... .. lowlife , ... .. bottom feeding ... .. trailer trash !
yes , mummy .
i am .
i am worthy of his memory .
stage dive !
aaaaaarrrgghh !
tolly !

daddy , can we keep her ?
she' s so cute .
tolly , are you ok ?
everything all right ?
mr plug .
i' ve examined your claim thoroughly .
you' re from the sceptical examiner !
oh !
afternoon .
did you see ?
did you see inside ?
as is typical of your claims with us , ... .. there is nothing extraordinary or unusual in any way to report .
but the rabbit ... and the zing ... and the wheeee ... and the zhooom ...
we' re not in the fruitcake business , mr plug .
evidently you are .
please , shh , ... don' t call again .

i ran , darling , i ran all the way .
goodness me .
little t , are you all right ?
ah , got you safe .
tom , tom !
come here .
come here , oh ... we saw fairies and they were flying !
there were fairy hunters , and they had a huge tunnel , and we won !
that' s wonderful ... so , that' s my story .
how me and my family and the craziest tooth fairy ever found magic again ... .. and got the holidays back on track .
ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ...
herbert the extractor escaped and became a professional soccer player .
those wacky golfers had a pretty good year .
and plug spent the rest of his holidays in jail .
as for my family , ... .. my dad started a car wash record store for the musically challenged ... .. and mom went to work for mrs c.
tolly got to keep the thing in the cage ... .. and she even got a new baby sitter .
everything' s fine , mrs wallit .
you and mr wallit just try and enjoy yourselves .
ciao .
and me , ...
tom wallit ?
i made a friend who liked me , ... .. even though i' m a flesh eating virus .
a friend who taught me that magic is inside all of us .
