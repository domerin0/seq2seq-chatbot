she thinks it' s dumb to spend $600 on an l. p.
carla' s right .
why don' t you just spend $13 . 00 on a cd , man ?
first of all , it' s because i' m a beatlemaniac .
and second , these sound better .
could be serious .
could be sarin gas .
dog out at j. f. k. caught a whiff of something in this package ... postmarked to a bosnian refugee camp .
it could be detergent ; it could be sarin gas .
bosnian refugee camp ?
half a million serbians reside in the u. s. serbians don' t like bosnians .

stan ?
hey , darlin ' .
i had such an interesting day today .
yeah , i had kind of an interesting day myself .
okay , you go first .
some terrorists decide to send a little care package box o ' goodies which had to be neutralized before blowing up the office .
i took the rest of the day off .
glass of wine , a little guitar relaxin ' .
wow .
i mean it , honey .
the world is being fed ex' d to hell on a handcart .
i believe that anyone who' s thinking about having a child in this world ... is coldly considering an act of cruelty .
i know , i' m rambling , i' m complaining , i' m sorry .
what' s your news , baby ?
i' m pregnant .
i' m sorry ?
i' m pregnant .
really ?
yeah .
wow .
all you' re gonna say is ' wow ' ?
you' re pregnant ?
three weeks .
how do you know ?
i mean , h how do you know ?
blue .
just turned blue , so i went to the doctor .
did you mean what you just said ?
when ?
just right now , when you were talking about bringing a child into the world ... and having it be an act of cruelty .
i meant it at the time .
at the time ?
you said it seven and a half seconds ago .
well ... gosh , kind of a lot' s happened since then .
we' re not even married .
i know .
it' s funny you should mention that .
it' s funny ?
do you love me ?
of course i love you .
good .
will you marry me ?
whoa .
marriage police , pull over .
come on , stanley .
i' m proposing to you right now .
the rock is the most famous and was the most feared prison ever built .
ls it really true that there' s never been an escape ?
ah , that' s true .
from 1936 until ' 63 when the prison closed ... there were 14 attempts .
no one is believed to have made it to shore alive , at least .
hey , fellas .
i' m sorry , but tourists are not allowed back here .
i don' t really give a shit .
you give a shit ?
no .
come here , fruity .
move !
hey , girls ?
you havin ' a good time ?
yeah .
will you do something for me ?
it' s really it' s really important .
tell your teacher that you need to get back on the boat and go home now .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome to broadway !
this cell block housed ... the most awesome scum in america .
ladies and gentlemen , i , ranger bob ... cordially invite you to become inmates of alcatraz temporarily , of course .
on line !
pretty tight quarters , aren' t they , huh ?
like being a caged animal .
spend a couple of years in there
something wrong with the tour ?
tour' s over , bob .
what kind of fucked up tour is this ?
gen. hummel , captains frye and darrow reporting , sir .
welcome to the rock .
land the choppers and deploy as planned .
aye , aye , sir .
aye , aye , sir .
move out !
i' m not allowed to carry a gun !
you' re not allowed to carry a gun ?
i got a goddamned gun !
lf i' d known this would happen , i' d have brought my motherfuckin ' gun !
help !
gentlemen , this' il be our new home .
i want my command center right here .
i want coms up .
roger that , sir .
put the satellite over there .
i want to be up at 1600 .
let' s move it .
systems up .
possible penetration point in the shower room .
we' re setting anti intrusion .
i brought a personal touch , sir .
it' s an antimotion trembler device .
it' s custom made .
nobody knows about it and nobody expects it .
what' s it do ?
we head fake ' em with the laser beam .
then if they disturb mr. backup here , [ chuckles ] we own ' em .
ladies and gentlemen , you' re being detained against your will .
for that i apologize .
it is not our intention in any way to harm you .
you' il not be detained longer than is needed for us to complete our mission .
attention on deck !
stand easy , men .
make no mistake about it , gentlemen .
we are now in harm' s way .
for major baxter and i , this is the last campaign in a career dating back ... to tet ' 68 .
likewise for captain hendrix and gunnery sergeant crisp ... who cut their teeth under my command in desert storm .
capt. frye , capt. darrow , this is my first operational situation with you ... and your men , and i have to say thus far your conduct reflects your reputations .
thank you , general .
thank you , sir .
we have achieved our position through poise , precision and audacity .
to this we must now add resolve .
we' il be branded as traitors , the gravest capital crime .
punishable by death .
two hundred years ago , a few guys named washington , jefferson and adams ... were branded as traitors by the british .
and now they' re called patriots .
ln time , so shall we .
god willing , in less than 48 hours we will evacuate this island in gunships ... under cover of hostages and v. x. gas warheads .
your destination : a nonextradition treaty country .
you will each be paid a fee of $1 million for services rendered .
but you can never again set foot on your native soil .
can you live with that ?
yes , sir !
the men of marine force recon are selected ... to carry out illegal operations throughout the world .
when they don' t come home ... their families are told fairy tales about what happened to them ... and denied compensation .
well , i have choked on these lies my entire career .
well , here and now the lies stop !
god be with all of you .
man your positions , men .
this is fbl director womack .
director ... be advised ... 81 ...
i say again ... 81 civilians are under my control as of this moment .
81 civilians are under my control as of this moment .
you are to take measures to assure this remains a need to know classified fact .
who is this ?
mr. director , you have a very serious problem .
a battery of v. x. gas rockets is presently deployed to deliver ... a highly lethal strike on the population of the san francisco bay area .
i will call again at 0100 hours to state my demands .
i wanna know who i' m talking to .
this is brigadier general ...
francis x. hummel , united states marine corps from alcatraz .
out .
i' il cancel your reservations .
get the pentagon and call the san francisco office .
it seems alcatraz was just reopened .
last night , gen. hummel , using brutal but nonlethal force ... under the guise of a security exercise ... walked off with 15 v. x. poison gas rockets .
he lost one of his own men in the process .
that' s gen. hummel in vietnam .
i think he was a major at the time .
three tours in vietnam , panama , grenada , desert storm ...
three purple hearts , two silver stars and the congressional medal of
jesus .
this man is a hero .
well , i think ' legend ' might be a better description , mr. sinclair .
well , now we can add kidnapping and extortion to his list of accolades .
mr. sinclair , gen. hummel is a man of honor .
general , it' s him .
frank , it' s al kramer .
hi , al .
how ya doin ' ?
i don' t know , frank .
why don' t you tell me ?
there are a lot of very , very worried people here , frank .
i' il come straight to the point .
83 force reconnaissance marines have died under my various commands .
47 in northern laos and southern china .
southern china ?
we never admitted we sent troops into china .
who is this ?
ldentify yourself .
white house chief of staff hayden sinclair , general .
how old are you , chief of staff sinclair ?
i' m 33 .
well , mr. sinclair ... you' ve probably got no fucking idea what i' m talking about .
by your ninth birthday , i was runnin ' black ops into china ... and my men were responsible for over 200 enemy kills .
now put some rigging tape over mr. sinclair' s mouth .
he' s wasting my time .
ah , you want to continue , frank ?
remember operation desert storm ?
those surgical hits made by our smart bombs covered so well on cnn ?
my men on the ground made those hits possible by lasing the targets .
twenty of them were left to rot outside baghdad after the conflict ended .
no benefits were paid to their families .
no medals conferred .
these men died for their country , and they weren' t even given ... a goddamn military burial .
the situation is unacceptable .
you will transfer $100 million from the grand cayman red sea trading company account ... to an account i designate .
from these funds , reparations of $1 million will be paid ... to each of the 83 marines ' families .
the rest of the funds i will disperse at my discretion .
do i make myself clear ?
except for the red sea trading company .
what is that ?
ldentify yourself .
this is fbl director womack , general .
it' s a slush fund where the pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales .
jesus , frank !
this is classified information .
you alert the media , i launch the gas .
you refuse payment , i launch the gas .
you' ve got 40 hours ' til noon , day after tomorrow to arrange transfer of the money .
i am aware of your countermeasure .
you and i know it doesn' t stand a chance .
hummel from alcatraz , out .
all right .
we have to identify the hostages and contact each of their families .
tell ' em somethin ' .
make up a story , and we' ve got to keep this undercover .
lf this comes out , the city of san francisco will be in chaos .
i am talking anarchy .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
what is the potential casualty rate ... for a single rocket armed with v. x. poison gas , gen. peterson ?
sixty or seventy .
well , that' s that' s not so bad .
thousand .
seventy thousand dead .
oh .
one teaspoon of this hits the floor ... it' s lethal up to ... 100 feet .
one teaspoon of this shit detonated in the atmosphere ... will kill every living organism in an eight block radius .
get the point ?
what did hummel mean by your ' countermeasure , ' general ?
standard poison is countered by napalm .
it burns it up , consumes it upon detonation .
the problem with v. x. poison gas ... is that it' s designed specifically to withstand napalm .
that' s where thermite plasma comes in .
gen. peterson ?
thermite plasma incendiary systems ... can burn hot enough to consume v. x. , but they' re still in the test phase .
it' s not operational .
hummel knows this .
we are dealing with one smart son of a bitch .
what' s it gonna take to equip a flight of f 18s ... with thermite plasma within the next 36 hours ?
an act of god .
excuse me ?
all right .
we can try .
but i strongly urge you to consider the use of this as a secondary initiative .
then we have to go to our primary initiative .
uh , admiral ?
sir , i' d like to bring in our seal ground commander , cmdr. anderson .
mr. womack , who is your best chemical/ biological man ?
that' s interesting .
oh , yeah .
that' s very compelling .
ahh , you like my pigtails ?
oh , yeah .
pigtails are naughty .
naughty , naughty  [ moans ]
you' re just an amaretto cream with peach sorbet persuasion .
this isn' t happening .
no , stan .
don' t answer it .
this isn' t happening !
no , just don' t answer it .
it' s okay .
i have to .
it' s the office , baby .
they know i' m home .
how could they know that you' re home ?
it' s the fbl .
stanley !
tsk !
goodspeed .
yeah .
okay .
yeah , i' il be i' il be down
yeah , downstairs in ten minutes .
no , you won' t .
i have to go to san francisco .
no , you don' t .
stanley .
no , you do not have to go to san francisco .
are you kidding me ?
you need to stay here and talk to me about things .
i' ve got to go , baby .
i am catholic .
do you realize that ?
i am pregnant and i am unmarried ... and this causes a serious problem for me .
i cannot believe you .
n n no .
i love you .
i will marry you .
i just didn' t plan on this , that' s all .
come to san francisco .
really ?
i' m sure it' s just a training exercise .
check into the hotel , order up some champagne
and we' il finish what we started ?
exactly .
baby , you gonna marry me ?
you know it .
you' re gonna marry me !
oh , honey , come on .
just a really quick one .
oh !
oh !
i gotta go !
a nighttime airdrop incursion is out , due to the full moon .
likewise a frontal seaside attack .
lf we' re compromised and shots are fired , hummel might launch .
our only alternative is an attack from within the prison .
we penetrate the island ... through the tunnels under the prison buildings undetected ... and emerge in its center , where we can jump the marines from behind ... and if we' re lucky , take their rocket positions without a shot fired .
i don' t understand .
you' ve studied the architectural plans ?
they' re useless .
alcatraz has been ripped up and rebuilt for years .
under there is a maze of shit .
there' s no question .
we need firsthand intelligence of the tunnel systems .
so what about the former warden ?
died in 1979 .
all the guards we contacted were useless .
umm ... there is someone who , i think , can help us .
this is for the sake of national security .
no , it' s the sake of national security ... that got us here in the first place 33 years ago .
i knew i knew someday this would come back to bite us .
forget it .
he does not exist .
he does exist !
we just forgot him for 30 years .
we locked him up and threw away the key .
oh , and a lot of goddamn good it did us .
he broke out of two maximum security prisons , and if he hits the streets
he' s not gonna ' hit the streets , ' jim !
thirty years ago he was a highly trained s. a. s. operative .
he is my age now , for christ' s sake .
i have to get up three times a night to take a piss .
we can' t risk letting him out .
he' s a professional escape artist .
here he is now .
ah .
neat , uh  yeah .
neat , neat plane .
dr. goodspeed .
james womack .
pleasure meeting you , sir .
thank you .
welcome .
you come very highly recommended .
b. a. , columbia ...
m. a. , ph. d. , johns hopkins .
biochemistry/ toxicology ?
well , i' m one of those fortunate people who like my job , sir .
got my first chemistry set when i was seven .
blew my eyebrows off .
we never saw the cat again .
been into it ever since .
what do you know about v. x. gas ?
liquid .
failed pesticide discovered by mistake in 1952 .
it' s kind of like champagne that way .
the franciscan monks thought ... they were making white wine , somehow the bottle carbonated , voila , champagne .
then the whole thing  the gas , dr. goodspeed .
it' s very horrible , sir .
it' s one of those things we wish we could disinvent .
this isn' t a training exercise , is it ?
no , dr. goodspeed , it' s not a training exercise .
ernest .
good morning , director .
this is ernest paxton , agent in charge of the west coast operation .
dr. goodspeed .
pleasure to meet you .
how do you do , sir ?
it' s been a fairly interesting day so far .
the prisoner' s here .
shall we ?
my boys haven' t been able to find a file on this guy .
who is he , anyway , sir ?
his name is john mason , a british national ... incarcerated on alcatraz in 1962 ... escaped in ' 63 .
i was under the impression that no one escaped alcatraz , sir .
paxton , don' t argue !
this man has no identity ... not in the united states or great britain .
he does not exist .
understand ?
how he escaped the rock .
specifically , the route he took through the island' s bowels .
papers are in order , sir .
we' re prepared to offer him a full pardon .
and , paxton , no strong arming mason .
i know him too well .
well , if you know him , then why don' t you question him ?
no , he' il remember me .
i don' t want his anger clouding the issue .
all right , i' il take care of him .
mr. mason , i' m special agent in charge ernest baxter .
ln charge of what ?
fucking me over for another three decades ?
i don' t know anything about your previous matters .
i' m here because ... a special situation exists that we feel you might be able to help us with .
now , what might that be ?
i' ve been in jail longer than nelson mandela ... so maybe you want me to run for president .
not exactly .
ah , pity .
i feel rather like alcamenes .
who ?
alcamenes .
he was imprisoned by his king in ancient greece .
like sir walter raleigh .
same fate .
james the first .
even someone as bright as you ... must be aware that , uh , there' s a certain pattern emerging here .
alexander solzhenitsyn ?
yeah , i heard of him .
didn' t he play hockey for the fuckin ' red wings ?
that' s the chap .
get this straight , pops .
i don' t like you any more than you like me .
but i' m here to make you a legitimate offer .
you wanna hear what i have to say or not ?
by all means , dear paxton , by all means .
we got a problem in a place that i think you know .
there' s a hostage situation on alcatraz .
hostage ?
eighty one tourists .
the rock has become a tourist attraction ?
why don' t we cut the shit , huh ?
you know the rock .
you broke out .
yes , successfully .
yeah .
so why don' t you do yourself a favor while you' re helpin ' us .
i mean , it' d be nice to get out of jail while you' re still vertical .
hmm ?
while you got a little lead left in your pencil ?
while i' m considering your offer ...
i want a suite at the fairmont hotel .
you know , i' m here to cut you a deal .
i am not here to bend over and take it up the ass from you .
here .
here' s a quarter .
do yourself a favor .
call your lawyer .
you' re goin ' back to jail .
you' re sending him back to jail ?
i' m not sending him anywhere .
i' m just givin ' him somethin ' to think about .
with all due respect , sir ... we don' t have time for him to think about it .
oh , really ?
no , goodspeed' s right .
go talk to him .
me ?
sir , i' m not qualified for that .
yes .
you' re an fbl agent .
what is your specialty again ?
chemical weapons .
don' t mention that !
you want me to lie ?
yeah , lie .
we got less than 24 hours .
give it a shot .
okay .
hiya !
i' m an agent with the , uh ... eh , federal fbl .
uh eh , well , my i' m stanley goodspeed .
but of course you are .
at least he got his name right .
of course i am .
and you have an emergency .
that' s right .
and you need my help .
exactly right .
coffee .
no , no , i' m fine , thank you .
offer me coffee .
oh , yes .
well , that was , in fact , going to be my next
could we get a cup of coffee in here , please ?
and offer ... to take these off .
mr. mason , really .
all kidding aside  as a gesture of your good faith .
prisoner requests to have his handcuffs taken off .
no , no , no !
look , why don' t you go ahead and have his handcuffs taken off , please ?
well , i guess that' s one way to go .
this is a pardon and release contract from the attorney general' s office .
now , it makes you a free man ... provided you cooperate .
so , if you' il just , ah , sign , uh , eh ...
uh , where it says  ' signature ' ?
that' s yes .
' signature . '
well ... timeo danaos et dona ferentis .
' i fear the greeks even when they bring gifts . '
oh , an educated man .
that rules out the possibility of you being a field agent .
ln point of fact , i am a field agent , mr. mason .
really .
yes .
ln which field ?
antiterrorism .
then you' re trained in weaponry , explosives and mortal combat .
well trained .
then it' s the fairmont hotel .
okay .
i want a suite ... a shower , a shave ... and the feel of a suit .
may i also suggest a haircut .
am i out of style ?
unless you' re a 20 year old guitarist from seattle .
it' s a grunge thing .
grunge ?
yeah .
well , uh , uh okay .
thank you very much .
all right .
call the fairmont .
close the floor if necessary ... but i want him sealed off , and he gets two hours max .
great job , goodspeed .
why didn' t you throw in a trip to tahiti ?
i' il deliver this to the attorney general .
no .
give it to me , reynolds .
take attorney reynolds outside .
there' s a car waiting for you .
thank you .
that' s a signed federal document , sir .
lsn' t that illegal ?
you' re not acquainted with the full facts , goodspeed .
with all due respect , sir , i' d like clarification .
i gave that man my word .
damn it !
you' re on a need to know basis , and you don' t need to know !
it' s uh , eh , kind of curious , but , uh

well , they were all wrongfully imprisoned .
womack !

oh !

mm hmm .
my secretary will settle the bill .
so , what do you have in store for me , womack , when this is over ?
you' il get your life back , mason .

why should i trust you now ?

i' m not really feeling too good about it , okay ?
wolfburg , got it ?
yeah , i got it .
all right , magrane , masconi , masters .

who was transferred to wolfburg from san quentin ?
this is weird .
they got medical records , they got place of birth glasgow
uh , but they don' t have a name .
uh , wait a minute , wait a minute !
they have next of kin .
a jade angelou of 32 stenson drive , san francisco .
jade ?
no , i' m stacy , jade' s friend .
were you afraid to come alone ?
yeah .
it' s okay .
i' il be over here if you need me .
last photograph i had of you , you were about ten .
yeah ?
i found a picture of you among my mom' s things ... when she died .
oh , yeah ?
well , uh
why don' t we take a walk ?
i got ' im .
palace of fine arts .
your mother , uh [ sighs ]
ya know , well , she was very special .
yeah , she was .
but i don' t think we should romanticize what happened between you and her .
meeting in a bar after a led zeppelin concert .
head out , and i was the result .
well , i' d like to think it would' ve led somewhere , if only
lf only what ?
six federal marshals hadn' t kicked down our door and dragged you back to prison ?
i' m sorry .
it' s all right .
so they let you out ?
yeah .
that' s good .
what did you do ?
' i do ' ?
jade , i don' t have a great deal of time here .
but i' il be coming back , and , uh ...
maybe we can  what ?
we can what ?
you know ... you' re almost the only evidence that i exist .
but i don' t know you .
that' s what i want to change , eh ?
i' ve rehearsed this speech a thousand times on the chance that we would meet .
here we are ... and i' m lost .
well , i don' t know how i' m supposed to be feeling either .
jade , i' m not an evil man .
lf you can believe that , then it' s a start .
okay .
ls this about you ?
you broke out of prison again , didn' t you ?
why did you come to me ?
fbl , ma' am .
your father' s working with us .
he' s helping us resolve a dangerous situation .
he is ?
yes , ma' am .
well , gee whiz , john , i guess we oughta get goin ' , huh ?
whatever you say , stanley .
thank you for that .
you could' ve handled it differently .
what do you say we cut the chitchat , a hole ?
you almost got me killed twice , and my jaw hurts like hell .
good .
cocksucker !
lf i had my way , you would be shipped back to wolfburg in leg irons ... and caged like an animal for the rest of your natural fuckin ' life !
you wrecked half the city !
give me a hand with the system .
now , tell me about the tunnels .
lf you know the system , it will take you wherever you need to go .
all right , there' s an intake pipe here , below low tide . ls that our best access ?
yes , that' s exactly where i came out .
then beneath the cistern
there' s a connection to the abandoned septic system .
how many feet is that ?
ehh ... 57 paces .
where do we go from there ?
where do you go from there ?
that' s a good question .
i have no idea .
what ?
i mean ...
i' il know when we' re all inside .
no .
you' re not goddamn goin ' .
show us on the blueprints .
i can' t !
my blueprint was in my head .
i was underground for three days in the dark ... just waiting for the tides to be right .
but don' t worry .
it' il all come back to me .
you' re not going anywhere , mason .
wait a second .
this piece of work might be the only chance those people over there have .
lf he' s not going , then why the hell did we get him out of jail ?
he' s smart .
i got him out to get you people in , not go with you .
lf it' s the only way of getting the intelligence i need ...
then he goes .
he' il fuck with you .
you compromise my men' s lives , and i' il bury you out there .
now , womack , you' re between the rock and a hard case .
hmm .
how' s your bowling arm ?
dr. goodspeed , the goal is to take out the launchers ... then neutralize the v. x. chemical rounds .
well , we know the poison' s being kept in the prison morgue from the satellite thermal imaging ... which is right here , these colorized dots .
have you ever actually seen one of these devices ?
no , sir , but i' ve studied them .
i should really begin briefing your guys on defusing and detoxification .
got a really neat layout here of the chem round as well as the rocket , so let' s get rolling .
that won' t be necessary .
oh , it' s very necessary , sir .
the power of this chemical is way beyond anything you can imagine .
an ecological disaster , sir .
plus , the devices themselves are complicated .
that' s why you' re coming with us .
i am ?
you' re the expert .
what' s your problem ?
you mean i' m going going out there ... under the water ?
earlier today you wanted a gun .
now you' re getting a gun and a wet suit .
have you ever been in a combat situation ?
define ' combat , ' sir .
shep ?
an incursion underwater to retake an impregnable fortress held by an elite team ... of u. s. marines in possession of 81 hostages and 15 guided rockets ... armed with v. x. poison gas .
oh . ln that case , no , sir .
excuse me .
here .
ah , thank you .
you don' t look too good .
ln fact , you look like shit .
my stomach' s doing hula hoops around my ass .
you all right ?
i mean , you gonna make it through this thing ?
i don' t know .
i always expected something like this was going to happen , but nothing prepares you for it .
now i' m i' m responsible ... for a whole city .
look , i know this isn' t easy for you .
remember , you were trained for this kind of situation .... and believe me , it' il come back to you .
besides , you got the best seal team in the country backin ' you up .
okay .
you' re right .
i' il be on the wire .
i' il help talk you through it .
there' s something else .
it' s terrible n no , it' s wonderful ... except it isn' t .
my girlfriend' s pregnant ... and she' s ... just flown in to see me .
you keep your mind on what you' re going to be doing out there tonight ... and i' il send someone to pick up your girlfriend and bring her here to the command center .
hummel !
hello , frank .
lou linstrom .
i' m at the white house with general kramer .
uh , frank , we' re havin ' a few problems with the account transfer .
don' t tell me problems , tell me solutions .
we' ve spoken to the president , and i know that you' re aware of his stance on terrorism ...
so what we' d like to do  this isn' t about terrorism .
this is about justice .
it' s about reminding you people who found it politically convenient to forget .
this is goin ' nowhere , frank .
15 v. x. gas rockets into the heart of san francisco .
you' ve got 17 hours to deliver the money .
or be prepared to reap the whirlwind , gentlemen .
what' s the word from mojave ?
general peterson can give us no definite assurance on the thermite plasma .
that is the word .
green light to seal incursion .
fall in !
fall in !
all right .
listen up .
mr. mason will run point for us .
lieutenant shepard will be attached to his hip .
you breathe , he breathes with you .
you piss , he helps .
understood ?
dr. goodspeed is our specialist .
when he neutralizes the threat , we launch green flares and we wait for the cavalry .
make no mistake , gentlemen , we' re in the fight of our lives ... against maybe the greatest battalion commander ... in the vietnam war , i shit you not .
any questions ?
let' s load up !
after you , ace .
pass out and activate the minicams .
everything set here ?
minicams operational ?
roger that , sir .
we are on line .
shep , what' s the status on the special operational gear for mr. mason ?
let' s see , we have , uh ... one quart of kerosene and a squeeze bottle ... three washers and waterproof matches .
use the green flares to signal when the threat has been neutralized .
now , this is atropine .
lf you come in contact with the gas ... you have 20 seconds to inject it into your heart .
don' t fuck with me on this .
it may save your life .
i have three incoming bogeys bearing 2 7 5 .
6, 000 meters .
fbl command center ?
oh , i would just love for you to tell me what is goin ' on .
nope .
listen , stanley goodspeed is my boyfriend .
actually , he' s my fianc .
where is he ?
classified , lady .
okay , well you just sit here and act like a bureau bonehead , then .
hey , where are you goddamn it .
decoy choppers commencing run to alcatraz .
i just lost one , sir .
i just lost one .
we only got two flying in .
i just lost one .
shit .
ln my day , we did it all with a snorkel and a pair of flippers .
your day ?
yes , didn' t you read my resume ?
i don' t i don' t know anything about you .
i know something about you , godspell .
goodspeed .
goodspeed , godspeed , godspell , you never went to any anti terrorist school .
so just make sure you don' t get us all fucking killed .
we' re going dark .
night vision !
raider one has dropped below radar coverage ... heading around treasure lsland .
sir , we' ve got two bogeys bearing due east and closing .
decoys ?
prepare to deploy !
good luck , commander .
sir , raider one is at the drop zone .
stanley' s not a very good swimmer .
i mean , he can' t even snorkel .
everyone , good to go ?
good to go !
good to go !
good to go !
so the s. d. u. s have been deployed , and the eagles are in the water .
major , i want the perimeter patrolled to the west end of the island .
yes , sir .
hendrix , lead the patrol .
aye , sir .
let' s move !
move out , move out , move out !
the eagles are on the rock .
they' ve entered the cistern room .
thank you very fucking much , mr. mason .
you sent us into a room with no exit .
any ideas , dillinger ?
figure it out soon .
we' re sitting ducks .
real tight on time .
you stand by the door .
until i open it .
i' d like to know how you plan on accomplishing that .
through here .
you' re shitting me .
i memorized the timing .
i just hope it hasn' t been changed .
you catch one of those flame bursts , you' re a corpse .
thank you .
commander , you said never leave his side , but , uh  stand fast , lieutenant .
have a nice day .
where' d you dig up this guy ?
that' s classified .
clear here , sir .
no motion sensors tripped .
nothing .
well , tell them to stay out there .
sweep forward !
looks like he fucked us , commander .
i knew it .
that son of a bitch jumped ship .
welcome to the rock .
mason .
that' s a no no .
that' s the subway .
that' il drop you into the tunnels .
do it !
sir , the eagles have breached the tunnel system .
you enjoying this ?
well , it' s certainly more enjoyable than my average day : reading philosophy , avoiding gang rape in the washroom .
though it' s less of a problem these days .
maybe i' m losing my sex appeal .
we' ve got seismic activity in one of the storm grates .
north side .
continue patrolling the area .
sweep forward .
commander , halt .
we' ve got movement .
they' re hearing sounds above , sir .
stand fast .
down , down , down .
west storm drain' s clear .
ninety seven paces to the shower room .
the eagles are now at the access tunnel .
they' re under the shower room , sir .
fiber optics .
something' s not right .
i' ve got a bad feeling about this .
quiet .
motion sensors .
beams cutting across manhole covers .
deal with it .
commander , the beam is hitting some sort of reflective device .
possibly a prism .
i want to use a mirror to cut the beam ... send the beam back to its source ... and then i' m going to move the prism .
we' ve got motion on a trembler in the shower room , sir .
we' ve got visitors .
let' s move .
got it .
good to go .
stand fast .
we' il secure the area .
they' re entering to the shower room , sir .
they' re securing the area .
just sit tight .
drop your weapons !
drop ' em !
get back !
hold your fire .
drop your weapons .
hold your fire !
it' s a fucking trap .
this is gen. hummel .
drop your weapons .
drop ' em !
anderson here , gen. hummel .
commander .
team leader .
cmdr. anderson , if you have any concern for the lives of your men ... you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on the deck .
this is not happening .
sir , we know why you' re out here .
god knows i agree with you .
but like you , i swore to defend this country against all enemies ... foreign , sir , and domestic .
general , we' ve spilled the same blood in the same mud .
you know goddamn well i can' t give that order .
we' re dead .
your unit is covered from an elevated position , commander .
i' m not gonna ask again .
don' t do anything stupid .
no one has to die here .
men following the general , you' re under oath as united states marines !
have you forgotten that ?
we all have shipmates we remember .
some of them were shit on and pissed on by the pentagon .
but that doesn' t give you the right to mutiny !
you call it what you want !
you' re down there ; we' re up here .
you walked into the wrong goddamn room , commander !
stand fast !
commander , one last time .
you tell your men to safety their weapons .
i cannot give that order !
i am not gonna repeat that order !
i will not give that order !
what the hell is wrong with you , man ?
stand fast !
oh , my god !
let' s waste these fuckers .
one last time .
you order your men to safety their weapons [ screaming ]
cease fire !
don' t go .
cease fire !
cease fire !
shit .
goddamn it .
let go of me .
let go of me !
don' t , don' t go .
fuck .
it' s over .
oh , god !
we got some movement .
who ?
who is it ?
two of ' em .
eagles 11 and 12 .
it' s goodspeed and mason .
i knew it .
i' ve gotta get a team together .
we' ve gotta move with the second option .
what , and invite another massacre ?
no way .
we' ve got a 60 year old convict and a lab rat .
i' m telling you , it' s over .
not for mason it isn' t .
goodspeed , i' m not gonna kill you .
where are you going ?
off this bloody island .
what ?
wh what for ?
goodspeed , do you read me ?
it' s for you .
sir ?
what' s the status ?
the status is , they' re dead .
they' re dead !
it' s just me and mason .
now he says he' s leaving .
that is unacceptable , do you hear me ?
unacceptable !
well , there' s a problem , sir .
he' s got a gun .
what do you have , a fuckin ' water pistol ?
no , sir .
go after him and stop him .
i didn' t want this .
jesus , i didn' t want this .
we knew this might happen .
maybe now they' il pay up .
maybe now they won' t , captain .
maybe we need to execute a few hostages .
got a live one !
put a bullet in him .
you heard him , end it .
holster that sidearm , captain !
sir ?
you made a terrible mistake .
and more of our brothers have died in vain .
damn you for forcing me into this position .
i need to talk to you .
right now , alone .
now you told me i' m on a need to know basis ... and i' m tellin ' you right now i need to know who the fuck john mason is right now , sir .
all right , you wanna know ?
1962 , j. edgar hoover ... is head of the fbl , some say the country .
it' s no secret he kept microfilm files on prominent americans and europeans : de gaulle , british members of parliament , even the prime minister .
i mean , this guy had dirt on everybody in the world .
yeah .
i know all the cloak and dagger stories .
where does mason fit in ?
mason was the british operative who stole the files .
but our bureau agents caught him at the canadian border .
of course , the british claimed they' d never heard of him .
and we held him without trial until he gave up the microfilm .
but he never did .
i' m surprised hoover didn' t use his daughter as leverage .
hoover was dead in ' 72 .
she wasn' t born yet .
today , well , it' s a different bureau .
so you held this guy without trial his whole life .
no wonder he' s pissed .
this man knows our most intimate secrets from the last half century : the alien landing at roswell , the truth about the j. f. k. assassination .
and mason' s angry , he' s lethal .
he' s a trained killer .
and he is the only hope that we have got .
mason !
mason !
there are 81 hostages still up there .
yeah .
like me .
you wanna play tough ?
you wanna play tough with me ?
okay , fbl !
freeze , sucker !
i' il fire .
no , you won' t .
throw down .
you' re not the sort .
let' s find out .
i could ; you , no .
besides , your safety' s on .
goodspeed , have you resolved the situation ?
not yet .
he' s got all the guns now , sir .
shit !
you' re right .
i don' t use guns and i don' t kick down doors .
this is what i do .
i haven' t got my glasses .
what it says is , ' chemical weapons specialist . '
that' s right .
i got a lunatic up there , man , with 15 missiles ... armed with some really funky stuff .
that lying womack .
you could' ve told my daughter .
it was classified .
look , i' m in the same situation .
they' ve got my girlfriend in the city with a baby on the way .
look , i can defuse the rockets .
i really can .
but i' m gonna need your help , and i' m gonna need it right now .
sir , this man' s weapons and tack radio are missing !
shit , we got a rodent problem .
flush the pipes .
there' s probably a maze of tunnels on this goddamn island .
check every access you can find .
sir !
even if you escape from the island ... you can' t escape the rockets .
so , where are you gonna go ?
go where ?
what' re you gonna do ?
show me where the morgue is , mason .
i' m out of here .
what about your daughter ?
mason ?
rodents located .
the way i see it , you don' t really have any choice , do you ?
i don' t think you do .
move !
ooooh !
they' re on to us .
burn ' em out .
this mother' s gonna blow big .
i don' t understand .
how could we lose radio contact all of a sudden ?
we' ve lost coms .
still got ' em on locaters .
so what' s it gonna be ?
what ?
how do you like your choices ?
i don' t .
that' s what i thought .
come on .
this is the oldest part of alcatraz .
did you know it was originally a civil war fort ?
oh , really ?
yeah , wow .
you know , i like history , too ... and maybe when this is over , you and i can stop by the souvenir shop together ... but right now , i just i just i wanna find some rockets .
don' t tempt me .
we are going to the morgue .
you sure you' re ready for this ?
i' il do my best .
your best ?
losers always whine about their best .
winners go home and fuck the prom queen .
carla was the prom queen .
really ?
yeah .
locaters have them approaching the morgue , sir .
come on , come on , you can do it , doc .
you must never hesitate .
i think you' re shooting too close to the rocket .
him , but not the rocket .
any other news , professor ?
the rocket !
not the rocket !
i got a little something for ya .
yeah , okay , that' s just about the most awful thing i' ve ever seen .
mason ... the second you don' t respect this , it kills you .
put it over there .
you' ve been around a lot of corpses . ls that normal ?
what , the feet thing ?
yeah , the feet thing .
yeah , that happens .
can you do something about it ?
like what ?
kill him again ?
listen , i' m just a biochemist .
most of the time , i work in a glass jar and lead a very uneventful life .
i drive a volvo , a beige one .
but what i' m dealing with is one of the most deadly substances the earth has ever known .
so what do you say you cut me some friggin ' slack ?
a really elegant string of pearls configuration .
unfortunately , incredibly unstable .
what exactly does this stuff do ?
lf the rocket renders it aerosol , it can take out the entire city of people .
really ?
what happens if you drop one ?
happily , it' il just wipe out you and me .
how ?
it' s a cholinesterase inhibitor .
it stops the brain from sending nerve messages down the spinal cord within 30 seconds .
any epidermal exposure or inhalation , and you' il know .
a twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes your nervous system .
do not move that !
your muscles freeze , you can' t breathe ... you spasm so hard you break your own back , spit your guts out .
but that' s after your skin melts off .
my god .
well , i think we' d like god on our side at the moment , don' t you ?
so what i' m doing now is removing the guidance system chips ... so the rocket' il splash down after 500 feet .
all right , let me have that .
you can let go of it .
all right , just back away .
just back away !
sir , morgue team has not checked in .
blackbird one , it' s blackbird , over .
blackbird one , this is blackbird , come in , goddamn it !
somebody' s still there .
let' s move !
rats alive !
close on the morgue !
close on the morgue !
go , go , go , go , go , go , go , go !
frye , darrow , hustle up .
we got more company !
hold it !
converge on the morgue !
move out !
goodspeed , come on .
come over here .
yeah , i love pressure , i eat it for breakfast .
come on .
time' s up .
there' s three rockets somewhere else .
we have to find them !
come on !
clear !
i' m too old for this !
where' s it go ?
i' ve no idea .
sir , all the guidance chips are gone .
captain , i guess you didn' t quite take care of the rat problem .
no , sir .
well , there are two dead men who strongly suggest you go finish the job .
yes , sir .
yes , sir !
you really don' t know where this goes ?
no , i don' t know where it goes .
well , we' re picking up speed .
do you know how to slow it down ?
no , i don' t .
god !
mason !
you all right ?
yes , perfectly okay , you fucking idiot .
they' re coming .
who ?
the marines !
where ?
what the fuck' s goin ' on ?
let' s cut him off .
mason !
mason !
you motherfucker , die , die , die !
i' m rather glad you didn' t hesitate too long .
how do you do it ?
oh , i was trained by the best .
british lntelligence .
come on .
but in retrospect , i' d rather have been a poet or a farmer .
okay .
okay , the president arrives in three hours .
his directive is to string hummel along until the air strike is operational .
what' s the word from mojave , general ?
same as last time , lou .
they' re going as fast as they can .
do it over here .
on your knees !
navy seals , listen up .
you' ve got something that belongs to me .
twelve guidance chips to be precise .
let me remind you that there are lives at stake , civilian lives .
speak up .
speak up !
oh !
i , uh
uh  tell them your name .
my name is larry henderson .
oh , man .
and i' m a father of three , and , uh ... they' ve got a gun to my head .
you' ve got exactly three minutes to return the guidance chips ... or mr. henderson won' t have a head .
oh , no .
hey , what
now , three to go .
you find them and defuse them .
okay ?
all right .
all right .
i' il try and delay hummel and give you more time .
hey , what about mr. henderson' s head ?
okay .
what do you mean ?
okay .
general .
who the hell are you ?
i' m all that' s left of the enemy .
bingo .
stand easy .
thought i' d been in the service a long time .
name and rank , sailor .
it' s army , actually .
answer the question .
and address him as ' general , sir . '
captain john patrick mason , general , sir .... of her majesty' s s. a. s.
retired , of course .
you' re a long way from home , captain .
how the hell are you involved in this ?
i have a unique knowledge of this prison facility .
i was , uh ... formerly a guest here .
hi , sweetie .
hey , come back here , little boy .
did they bother to tell you who i am , why i' m doing this ... or are they just using you like they do everybody else ?
all i know is you were big in vietnam .
i saw the highlights on television .
you wouldn' t have any idea what it means to lead the finest men on god' s earth into battle ... and then see their memory betrayed by their own fuckin ' government !
i don' t quite see how you cherish the memory of the dead by killing another million .
and , uh ... this is not combat .
it' s an act of lunacy , general , sir .
personally , i think you' re a fuckin ' idiot .
' the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time ...
' with the blood of patriots and tyrants . '
thomas jefferson .
' patriotism is the virtue of the vicious , ' according to oscar wilde .
thank you for making my point .
where are the guidance chips ?
where are the guidance chips !
i destroyed them .
that was a bad move , soldier .
does that mean you' il execute us both ?
you' re lucky that old man hummel wants you alive .
' cause i' d take pleasure in guttin ' you , boy .
i' d take pleasure in guttin ' you ... boy .
i' il take pleasure in guttin ' you .
boy .
what is wrong with these people , huh , mason ?
don' t you think there' s a lot of anger floatin ' around this island ?
kind of a pubescent volatility ?
don' t you think ?
a lot of angst , lot of ' i' m 16 , i' m angry at my father ' syndrome ?
i mean , grow up !
we' re stuck on an island ... with a bunch of violence for pleasure seeking psychopathic marines .
shame on them !
anyway , i only got one chem rod , and there' s two left .
mason ?
yes , i' m here .
i was just thinking how wonderful it was ... when the inmates weren' t allowed to talk in here .
not allowed to talk .
how did you do it ?
nurtured the hope that there was hope ... that one day i' d breathe free air .
perhaps meet my daughter .
modest hopes , but they kept a man alive .
what did they put you away for , john ?
oh , that' s a long story .
well , i' m not going anywhere .
when was the last communication from our men on alcatraz ?
seven hours .
thermite plasma is operational .
get me the president .
be seated .
gentlemen , consider yourselves on ground alert .
lf we receive launch authority , your mission : the complete thermal destruction of alcatraz lsland .
the entire island is to be blanketed , not one square inch missed .
eighty one american civilians and a number of u. s. marines will lose their lives .
why didn' t you just tell them where the microfilm was and create a solution ?
the moment they had the microfilm , they' d suicide me .
some solution .
you ended up here .
which brings me to another question .
you broke out let me see if i can get this straight you went down the incinerator chute , on the mine car ... through the tunnels to the power plant ... under the steam engine that was really cool , by the way and into the cistern through the intake pipe ... [ clears throat ] but how , in the name of zeus' s butthole ... did you get out of your cell ?
i only ask because in our current situation ... well , it could prove to be useful information , maybe !
trade secrets , my son .
wow .
general , two operational rockets left .
one at the lower lighthouse and one at the roof .
both of the birds are ready to fly , sir .
general , can you hear me ?
i heard you , captain .
just makin ' sure .
should we ... prepare for launch , general ?
i' il handle the strategy , captain .
yes , sir .
the hour is approaching .
just letting the general know of the time , sir .
i' m very aware of the time , captain .
aye , aye , sir .
lettin ' you know .
me and my boys are cocked , locked and ready to rock .
mason , where are you going ?
thirty years ago i vowed i wouldn' t die in this toilet .
you' re not leaving !
there' s a madman in there with his hand on a button !
shhh .
some sniper' s gonna get his ass .
stop moving , mason .
mason , stop moving .
hummel won' t do it .
he' s a soldier , not a murderer .
i read it in his eyes .
read his eyes ?
oh , well , then everything' s just fine !
i can' t afford to take that chance .
why don' t you talk louder ?
three minutes to go , sir .
they' re not gonna call for it .
oh , they' il call .
they' il call if we fire one of our rockets up their ass .
sir .
hummel .
hi , frank , it' s al kramer here .
how' s it going out there ?
how do you think it' s going ?
we' re gonna need another hour , frank .
you' ve got three minutes .
we have to get authorization from the president .
you' ve got three minutes .
frank , please don' t do anything stupid .
they want another hour .
that' s bullshit .
that' s bullshit , general .
they' re lying .
they' re calling our bluff , sir .
they' re playing you for a fool .
sir , order the launch , general .
come on , general , let' s be all we can be .
the mission' s not complete !
well , mine is .
when this is over , you' il go back home ... driving carla and your baby insane in your beige volvo .
and i' il be dead , or back in prison , which is the same thing .
you' re not leaving .
all right ...
i' il do it myself .
i got three weeks ' weapons training .
i' il kick the out of a platoon full of marines .
no problem .
major , patch me into roof battery .
aye , sir .
fire open control circuit coordinates to the roof , sir .
let' s go !
laser powered up .
oh , no .
i said , on your knees !
my name' s stanley goodspeed .
i' m a chemical weapons specialist for the fbl .
uh , glass or plastic ?
what ?
glass or plastic !
shut the fuck up !
because if the winds change , and if you launch those rockets , we' re all gonna die .
shut up !
and you' re gonna end up in either a glass jar or a plastic bag .
so do the math , hand over the gun and let' s go find some rockets !
i said shut the fuck [ neck snaps ]
you made the right choice .
i decided i didn' t want your child growing up without a father .
hey , the last time i swam this channel i was your age .
so i' m fucked either way .
so come on .
the weapon is hot .
i am standing by for the launch command .
man , killing navy seals is one thing ls this for real ?
hey , it' s business .
access code entered .
weapon available for release .
launch coordinates : six , seven , five , four , five , niner .
the weapon is hot .
i' m standing by for launch command .
it' s affirmative .
standing by for command .
i' m waiting for a launch command , general .
fire .
fire !
missile loose !
missile loose !
alcatraz , 67253725 .
what' s the heading ?
heading 185 degrees south southeast .
speed ?
300 knots .
it' s headed right at oakland .
the football game .
oh , my god .
missile radically changing direction .
275 degrees west .
it' s headed out to sea , sir .
oh , christ !
missile losing altitude .
falling .
falling , 300 feet , 200 , 100 .
bogey detonated under water .
what the fuck ?
it missed .
well , that' s great .
extremely great , but there' s still one left .
what happened to the rocket ?
what happened to the coordinates ?
what the fuck is going on ?
sir !
major !
captain , step outside .
talk to me , sir .
captain , step outside !
get me the pentagon .
what the hell was that , frank ?
i said , what the hell  i heard what you said !
i' d appreciate a little more respect .
cut the crap , general .
what the hell are you doing ?
i' m not ready to kill these people .
call the pentagon .
ask for more time .
no .
do it , frank !
we' re coming loose .
you' re coming loose .
the rest of us are in complete control .
we' re gonna ask for a new deadline .
put the phone down .
the men are falling apart !
the men are marines !
are they ?
i wanna talk to gen. kramer .
you' ve been asked by an old friend .
put him on the phone right now .
you' ve been ordered .
this is major baxter !
now you' re being given your last chance by a man with a gun .
put the phone down .
i thought you weren' t ready to kill .
i' m warming up .
at ease .
they need a decision , mr. president .
these past few hours ... have been the longest , darkest of my life .
how does one weigh human life ?
one million civilians against 81 hostages .
and in the middle , frank hummel .
that we have ignored , abandoned ... or marginalized a great soldier like frank hummel ... and american boys have paid for that neglect ... with blood is equally real ... and equally tragic .
we are at war with terror ... and fighting war means casualties .
this is the worst call i' ve ever had to make .
air strike approved .
red thunder to tower .
request clearance .
the amount of firepower they' re gonna drop in there ...
this is strike leader .
prepared to go . it' il be over in a few seconds .
17 minutes .
excuse me , general , sir , with all due respect to you , but what the fuck is going on ?
you changed the coordinates , didn' t you , general ?
that' s affirmative , captain .
now they think we' re gutless , the feds ?
they think we won' t actually do it .
they' re gonna come at us with everything they got .
air and sea .
they' re gonna bomb our ass back to the stone age .
they don' t know we missed on purpose .
great .
we' re not gutless .
we' re incompetent .
that right ?
i don' t think i like your tone , captain .
we planned for this contingency .
load the v. x. into the choppers , take four hostages and evacuate .
the consequences of our actions i' il face alone .
excuse me , general , but what about the fucking money ?
there is no fucking money .
mission' s over .
bullshit it' s over .
you' re talking to a general , soldier !
maintain discipline !
i' m not a soldier , major .
the day we took hostages we became mercenaries .
and mercenaries get paid .
i want my fucking money !
this mission was based on the threat of force .
i' m not about to kill 80, 000 innocent people .
do you think i' m out of my fucking mind ?
we bluffed .
they called it .
the mission' s over .
who ever said anything about bluffing , general ?
stand down , captain .
stand down , captain !
major , i' m ordering you to take these men to the choppers and evacuate .
that' s a simple order , major !
it' s not so simple , frank .
sgt. crisp , secure the general .
i' m relieving you of your command , sir .
sergeant !
i' il have that sidearm , sir .
you mean this sidearm ?
maj. baxter , you' re either with us or against us .
it has been the greatest honor of my life to serve with you , general .
but like he said ... it' s over .
let' s get him .

there has to be something you can do .

i' m fed up saving your ass .
i' m amazed you ever got past puberty .
i suppose all this will make a great bedtime story to tell your kid .
