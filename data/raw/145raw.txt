previously on " alias " ...
someone now has the ability to detonate six nuclear weapons , and i am responsible .
so i am going to be part of the team that finds and disarms those warheads .
i need your help .
there are two things you need to know about this necklace .
it' s layered with c 4 .
if you remove it while it' s armed , you' il break the circuit , and it' il detonate .
if at any moment i believe you' re attempting to escape or sabotage us ,
i' il activate this remote trigger and blow your head off myself .
hold it .
back up now !
is there something you' d like to tell us ?
we' d like the warheads you' ve acquired .
thank you for the supplies .
of course .
absolutely .
mr. vaughn .
yes , sir .
mr. vaughn .
the necklace has been deactivated .
i' il have to call you back .
when ?
just now .
you' ve confirmed this ?
yes .
satellite imagery detects combat .
combat ?
what just happened ?
it' s over .
can we tell if there' s survivors ?
not with this bird .
we need new satellites .
even if they survive , sending in a team is out of the question .
why ?
they' re on an authorized mission .
a clandestine mission .
if we start scouring the countryside , the indian government is gonna figure out that
pakistani supported rebels have acquired nuclear weapons .
they' re gonna launch strikes .
the pakistanis retaliate .
i' m gonna get called in front of committees demanding to know why we screwed up !
the only thing we' re interested in is how to make this problem disappear .
i want an options paper from you in two hours .
after that , i' d like to look for the bristows .
nuclear weapons .
i shouldn' t have to define your priorities .
i don' t think we should cut them loose .
alive or dead , the mission failed .
so if the bristows are out there , they' re on their own .
hey , man .
check this out .
nothing like more bad news ?
maybe they were a roving patrol .
no , prf rebels would never be this deep into indian territory without being dispatched .
your father' s right .
we had one advantage .
surprise .
now that' s gone .
just a second .
can' t stop .
more patrols could be in the area .
what happened ?
nothing .
i just scraped my leg .
dad , i can do it .
i got it .
you need to stop the bleeding .
where are you going ?
these bushes .
they have myrtus communis berries .
their juice soothes the skin , helps healing .
you should put this on first .
seriously , i' m fine .
you' re not .
no , you' re not fine .
jack , i know you' re determined to get to srinagar , but my contact in jaipur is much closer .
he' s reliable .
he has good equipment .
this is a cla mission .
i have operational control .
you' re a prisoner .
your only function , sole reason you' re breathing air , is to use your knowledge of the rebels ' base to help us steal the suitcase nukes and leave .
that' s why we' re using people i know and trust .
i' m not having this conversation again .
you okay ?
thanks .
this is not a power play .
the facility we' re headed for , security' s tighter than the nsa .
if i don' t have the right equipment , it' s pointless .
we should move .
i know what you' re thinking .
do you ?
the toaster .
what are you guys talking about ?
we used to have this toaster at home .
it was broken , and using it one night ,
i started a small fire .
we had something like this to drink , and we both had a little too much .
i forgot about the toast i was making .
when was this ?
you were 4 years old .
there was so much smoke , we had to move out for a week .
we stayed in that hotel .
summit .
wait .
was that the hotel with the sundaes ?
i think you had one every night .
you should get some sleep .
jack ?
i would have called .
i need your help .
yes , of course .
no one can see you dressed like this .
that' s one of the reasons we' re here .
it is good to see you again .
you too .
you look well .
imagine how bad i looked before .
are you who i think ...
is she yours ?
yes .
he always brags about you .
he showed me a picture once ...
we need to penetrate a class a target outside muzaffarabad .
we' il need aliases , papers , transpo , ammo , sat phone , and security penetration .
yes .
would you like some tea ?
no , thank you .
we also need tactical gear and night vision goggles .
yes ... except no .
my main supplier died two months ago .
saresh was killed ?
heart attack .
we are old men , jack .
we don' t live forever , especially in kashmir .
of course , i can provide aliases , basic weapons , access to satellite phone and transportation .
what kind of security ?
biometric sensors .
dual infrared passive and microwave sensors .
fiber optics on the fence .
your timeframe ?
none .
we' re behind schedule .
well , i can do what i can do , but it might not be enough .
we' il take whatever you' ve got .
thank you .
yes .
first thing ...
you need to be looking not like you .
hi .
i' m on a secure line .
sydney .
we saw the blast .
what happened ?
i' il fill you in later .
we were compromised .
i' m glad you' re okay .
what about your parents ?
some people go miniature golfing .
we go to india and look for nukes .
listen , sydney .
we intercepted a communication .
the rebels say they' re activating the nukes tomorrow .
activate how ?
we don' t know .
deploy , detonate ?
activate .
that' s the word they used .
it might mean delivery , detonation .
we don' t know , but we have to assume the worst since they got the control codes through sd 6 .
i got the control codes for sd 6 .
i can deactivate the nukes .
if you get there in time .
perfect .
here .
my truck is on the other side of the market .
i owe you .
what kind of air filter does it have ?
a foam filter .
that won' t work .
it' il clog up in the desert .
we' il return the truck as soon as we can .
it' il never get us there .
you think i' m second guessing you .
this is my decision .
it is not negotiable !
listen to me !
we have a job to do .
your issues are going to have to be dealt with later .
please excuse us .
right now we have six suitcase nukes that are going to be activated tomorrow .
is that confirmed ?
cla doesn' t have details .
they want us to deactivate the nukes .
cla needs to get authorization for a strike now .
they need confirmation the nukes are there .
it' il be too late .
not if we work together .
this is the way it' s gonna be .
dad will decide how we get to the base .
it' s his call .
once we arrive , mom takes over .
you know your way around .
you' il lead us to the nukes and back out .
then you' il resume control and get us home .
there will be no objections to and no deviations from this plan .
three of these are filled with grain .
irina , you' il be in the fourth .
you can' t be serious .
she' s the most likely to be recognized .
the rebels are looking for a 3 person team .
we have a better chance of avoiding detection if we alter our configuration .
you sure she can breathe in there ?
dad , we need to get moving .
i know .
i' m just ... preparing myself to let irina out .
it' il be fine .
sydney , i' ve been doing this job a long time , so when you lectured me about continuing the mission ...
dad , my point was ...
i know what your point was .
the truth is ...
i needed to hear it .
i' m proud of you .
that' s all .
thank you .
what are we doing here ?
this is not the drop .
the filter got clogged , didn' t it ?
we' re still 10 miles away from the base .
we need to hike to the field , where we' il access a sewage tunnel .
that' il lead us into the facility .
i thought you said security was heavy .
it is , on the other side of the facility .
at the entry point we' re using , the rebels rely on land mines to keep intruders away .
we don' t have the equipment to detect land mines .
we don' t have the equipment because your contact didn' t come through .
i know where the mines are .
you' il walk through a minefield you haven' t seen in 19 years ?
is there another way ?
and assume no new mines ?
i just spent five hours in a grain bin .
it' s my turn now .
let' s get to it .
i spoke with gerard cuvee , leader of the prf .
he' s quite charming .
more like a banker than a rebel leader .
but you' re a money man , too , aren' t you ?
is everything in place ?
the nuclear cores will be activated at 1700 hours .
as soon as it' s done , they' il upload the results to our server .
sir , i have someone calling regarding your wife .
they won' t identify themselves .
record the call .
i need some privacy .
romantic touch .
your wife' s ring finger .
by now , your lab' s confirmed that despite your best efforts , you didn' t kill emily .
and now i have her .
what do you want ? $ 100 million in bearer bonds .
this is about money ?
everything is about money .
instructions for the drop have been electronically mailed to you .
you' ve got 24 hours .
fail to deliver the bonds , and the next delivery will go to the alliance .
where did the prf get all these mines ?
you americans have the worst inventory controls in the world .
so , sydney , how' s school ?
i' m writing my dissertation .
supposedly .
quiet .
behind the tree !
to your left , jack !
jack , i need a gun .
don' t move .
you' re on a mine .
sydney , don' t move !
five steps forward .
three to your left ... and straight towards us .
are you hurt ?
no .
the bullet hit my vest .
it' s an m 26 anti personnel mine .
we' il need to pry off the panel and remove the blasting cap .
you need to cut the core that leads to the blasting cap .
her knife' s not coated .
if she cuts with metal , she' il complete the circuit and set it off .
i can do it .
it' s okay .
over that hill is the entrance to the tunnel .
we should hurry .
follow closely .
contact the bristows .
tell them to pull out .
i have no way of initiating .
why ?
the indians found out the rebels have acquired nukes .
they' re launching air strikes in 24 hours .
we have to get them to back off .
they' re angry we knew and kept it from them .
they' re insisting on going forward .
then let me make a personal appeal .
vaughn , everybody is working on this .
state , nsc , dod .
you' re probably gonna say no to this ... but i want to go to india .
i was stationed there for two years .
i have relationships with ...
go .
go ?
i' il have a military aircraft waiting .
this is totally back channel .
you' re just gonna ...
are you trying to get rid of me ?
clear .
we' re here .
the nukes will either be in a sealed r& d lab or a vault located in the sub basement .
the lab' s security system is more sophisticated .
so check the vault first ?
not if we only get one shot .
the lab has thermal sensors to detect intruders through their body heat .
if we raise the room to body temperature , 98 . 6 degrees , the sensors won' t be able to distinguish between us and the thermostat level of the lab .
sydney , you' il get to the central heating control panel .
it' s located in a room near the stairwell in the sub basement .
find the panel for zone 3 .
got it .
jack , the lab door is controlled by a voice recognition system .
only cuvee' s voice is programmed to open it .
we need to break into the main computer system here to access his file .
you' il erase his voice and substitute your own .
i' il be in cuvee' s private office .
you and i are not separating .
not in here .
jack , listen to me .
unless i deactivate the facility' s surveillance system from cuvee' s office , we won' t get anywhere near the nukes .
no .
you' ve done good work getting us here .
i' m not blind to that .
but i' m also far from trusting you .
if you want those nukes for yourself , this is a perfect setup .
you were an officer in this facility .
you' ve got friends here willing to work with you .
friends ?
know what this place was when i was here , jack ?
a prison .
where the kgb interrogated suspected traitors .
and , no , i wasn' t an officer here .
i was a prisoner .
why do you think i learned the sewage tunnels or memorized the mine locations ?
so i could escape , you idiot .
we' re out of time .
we either split up and meet at the lab in five minutes , or we' re going back .
it' s your choice .
dad , she' s right .
we don' t have any more time .
i' il be in the lab in five minutes .
i promise .
you better be .
mera naam gerard cuvee .
mera naam gerard cuvee .
thank you for agreeing to this emergency meeting .
despite my best efforts to comply with your orders to kill my wife after she learned the truth about sd 6 , someone interfered .
and this person is now extorting me for her return .
last week , the blackmailers sent me emily' s finger .
her ring finger .
lab tests confirmed emily was alive when they severed the finger .
blood coagulation tests are not 100 % accurate .
yes , but they are reliable .
then , two days ago , security section obtained those .
those are photographs of airport security in santiago and london .
and we have confirmed that emily was on flight manifests last week .
any idea on the men with her ?
no , but the blackmailer wants $ 100 million in bearer bonds for her return .
who else knew about your instructions to kill emily ?
only the people in this room .
you believe one of us may be behind this ?
no .
but someone has infiltrated our secure communications .
well , whoever it is will get nothing .
no .
it' s not quite that simple .
we have to eliminate this leak before more damaging information about the alliance gets out .
so i propose that we put a tracking device on the bonds .
that we make this exchange .
that we follow the blackmailer .
and we assassinate him .
you understand , arvin , after all this , if you get your wife back , she will still have to be eliminated .
i understand .
the thermal sensors are neutralized .
where' s your mother ?
i haven' t seen her .
we got this far .
she must have gotten to cuvee' s office and disabled the system .
she' il be here .
mera naam gerard cuvee .
we' re not waiting .
use the control codes to begin deactivation .
the plutonium core is gone .
hi , mr. sloane , it' s me .
marshall .
but ... sorry .
you probably already know that .
we planned this .
anyway , the tracer on the bonds is working perfectly .
good .
i' m turning off my comm .
i see you .
leave the briefcase on the bench and keep walking .
proceed toward the corner while we verify the authenticity of the bonds .
oh , yeah , i got you , baby .
right into my wheelhouse .
come on .
go to the row of vending machines .
take the " city view . " fifth from the top .
i told you , ain' t nobody getting by
magic marshall' s invisible liquid tracer .
i say , come on !
come on !
wait a minute .
wait .
no .
where did ...
oh , god , no .
no !
i think you understand the situation you find yourself in ...
not to brag , but i' m kind of responsible for matchmaking you and irina .
didn' t she tell you ?
i was a supervisor at the kgb .
i gave her the assignment to go to the u. s.
and marry a cla officer .
you weren' t the only prospect , but you had the most potential .
i actually thought it would dawn on you that a woman like this would never go for someone like you .
luckily for me ... your ego was too big for that .
you' re a dead man !
no , wait , wait .
i want what we came for .
sark' s made a deal with us .
what kind of double cross is he planning ?
maybe you didn' t hear me .
we know sark has a new partner .
who is it ?
get the information ...
and meet me in my office .
i was caught .
i had to do this , or we' d all be killed .
they' re not detonating the nukes .
here' s what you have to do .
is everything on target ?
we ran into a few problems , but ...
what kind of problems ?
we' ve got it under control .
we' il proceed as planned .
i' il expect your report within the hour .
trust me on this .
if you don' t make it out , i' m sorry this happened .
mr. vaughn , good to see you again .
but i' m afraid you came a long way for nothing .
we have people at the prf base stealing the nukes .
if they fail , we' il be the pakistanis ' target .
they won' t fail .
you can' t guarantee that .
if you launch those strikes , you will be killing some of our best assets .
your government knew the rebels acquired the suitcase nukes .
they said nothing .
they place our country at risk .
at least delay a few hours until we get our people out .
i' m sorry .
the air strike goes as planned .
you look more like your father every time i see you .
my father wrote about you ... in his journal .
he wrote that he trusted you and respected you , and that is why i came such a long way .
i cannot call off the strike .
but i will give you a head start .
meaning what ?
meaning a chopper and a pilot .
but if you' re going to try to rescue your friends , you' re doing so at your own risk .
dad !
shh !
how did you get free ?
your mother is helping us .
what ?
what about cuvee ?
she was torturing you .
she was putting on a show for cuvee .
before she left , she put these in my hand .
she told me they' re using the cores to activate a rambaldi artifact .
they' re not detonating the nukes ?
rambaldi experimented with self sustaining cell regeneration .
this artifact they' re opening is reported to be rambaldi' s proof of endless life .
we have no time to make any meaningful assessment .
your mother claims to have provided us the opportunity to contact the cla for extraction , and we should act on it .
can' t this thing go faster ?
this is it .
we' re going against the wind .
operations .
this is mountaineer .
voice i. d. number alpha charlie 7 1 10 .
i need to speak with agent vaughn .
vaughn' s not available .
let me give you kendall .
agent bristow , do you have the package ?
we' re in process .
we' il need extraction .
abort .
the indians have launched air strikes .
air strikes ?
we' re not finished .
get them to hold off .
fighter planes are in the sky .
you have to leave now .
not until we get my mother .
i am ordering you out .
head for the extraction point .
this is jack .
you' il either hear from us again , or you won' t .
our assignment is to bring her back .
that' s our job .
a flower ?
that' s what this is all about ?
we need to get the cores and get out of here .
it' s vaughn !
we' ve got the cores .
tell them to call off the air strikes .
this is agent vaughn .
abort the air strikes .
repeat .
abort the air strikes .
you must have a lot of questions .
one thing that should not wait any longer is why i shot you in taipei .
the rebel leader , gerard cuvee , when you were in taipei ... he was in the next room watching to see if i would betray him or you .
shooting you in the shoulder ... giving you time to escape .
it was the only way i could think to maintain his trust ... and keep him from killing both of us .
we' re both tired .
you should get some rest .
you too ...
... mom .
hi .
any word on the flower ?
preliminary analysis indicates that it' s anywhere from 400 to 600 years old .
like i said , preliminary .
what' s this ?
