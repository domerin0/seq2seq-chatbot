one night , a girl came running under my umbrella
my heart still lingers on that nightstreet
then i believed we shared the same soul
but she loves someone else
a man who makes her shed tears
sadly , there isn' t a thing i can do for her
she often makes me feel that the world has ended
i wish i could get over her like the umbrella i left on the bus
looking at his drawing
i can tell he has a pure soul
hyun soo , don' t give up
i hope things work out with her
one summer night by chelsia chan and abba

students , go back to your classrooms
a school inspector is on his way to our school
go back to your classrooms
a school inspector is on his way
hurry back to your classrooms
woo sik
woo sik !
i couldn' t call out to him any more
someone had sent an anonymous letter to the school inspector on the new class system
it must be one of the kids in the inferior classes
they' re fucked
the school inspector was hiding in the outhouse
no more inferior classes ?
you fools do nothing but talk
i sent the letter , man
bullshit go clean the bathroom
be thankful to me
we study with smart ones and what ?
we became smart , too ?
hell no !
have you heard about woo sik ?
no ?
he took off
with a girl from eunmyung
says who ?
his mom was here earlier
i bet it' s eun ju
model student my ass !
i knew she was a horny bitch
what ?
what makes you so sure ?
you didn' t see them
what are you getting upset at me for ?
you really don' t know ?
no i haven' t seen him since that day
where the hell is he then ?
if you hear from him let me know
i heard ...
he ran away with a girl
is that true ?

huh ?
no
eun ju ...
eun ju
eun ju !
eun ju !
you bastard !
you call yourself human ?
look at this
you call these grades ?
you think you can go to college ?
do yourself a big favor
drop out of school and start temping for peanuts !
i' m not going to college
i' il drop out !
what ?
you bastard !
you know what you become without a degree ?
' a surplus man ' !
you know what that means ?
you' re nothing but waste !
you think you' re a smart ass ?
then get out of my house !
what the ...
yeah , i was a surplus man
i had no dreams left in me
not a thing that i was to do or that i wanted to do
then i had an urge to jump
like those raindrops falling ...
i felt like falling , too
hamburger !
how are you doing , bruce ?
welcome , brother jong hoon
you' ve got tits , man

fuck you your fly is open
i prefer the inferior class
those in the superior class do nothing but study
i should hang out here from now on
hamburger , go ahead show me some moves
if you wish , bro
i' m fine , it' s nothing
it gave me a hard on
he thinks his bruce lee
fool !
cheetah
we need to talk
you wanna quit school ?
why don' t you rat on me , too ?
you' re not smart , so what ?
morality is all that counts
you go to a good college but you' re immoral then what' s the point ?
many people make it big in life without a degree
this new class system is for your own good
why can' t you see that ?
we' re not playing favoritism
and someone had to send an anonymous letter
how would that make us feel ?
being a righteous person is far more important than getting into a good college
where are you going ?
hey , woo sik' s sidekick !
did you just glare at me ?
don' t make faces at me
