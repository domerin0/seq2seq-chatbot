how much longer ?
are you in a hurry ?
we' re almost there .
egypt october 1942
this is it .
you' re here .
report over there .
okay , thanks .
is that good water from el daba ?
yes , a two liter canteen .
don' t let them steal it .
pvt. serra , reporting .
i just got here .
i' ve been posted here .
lt. fiore .
are you alone ?
what do you mean , sir ?
i asked for substitutes , i expected at least 10 men .
are you alone ?
yes , sir .
are you an urban vigilante ?
i' m a university volunteer .
i know what it stands for .
it was a joke .
what do you study ?
literature and philosophy , third year .
why didn' t you finish ?
i heard soldiers were needed on the front , i' d be a coward not to go .
they said they' d send us to africa , so i signed up .
where are you from ?
palermo .
what' s being said in italy ?
we' il arrive in alexandria and drive the british out of egypt .
how' s the weather there ?
fall has begun , but we' re still swimming in palermo .
is that good water ?
yes .
let me have a sip .
come on .
good .
sorry , water' s an issue here .
you' il join s. sgt. rizzo' s unit .
corporal .
take our student to rizzo .
take off that patch .
it' s useless here .
yes , sir .
why did he tell me to remove it ?
some people have been in africa for two years now .
they' ve earned repatriation , but can' t get back home .
when they see someone who could have stayed home ... but decided to volunteer ... they get ticked off .
what was that ?
british 88' s .
they always shoot four at a time ... but the ones that hit you sound different .
it' s the first thing you need to know .
if you want to get out alive , perk up your ears .
give me some of your water .
excuse me ...
i haven' t had real water in so long .
get down , this' il hit us !
corporal !
who are you ?
what happened ?
pvt. serra .
i have to join sergeant rizzo' s unit .
they shot at me and the corporal , but i can' t find him anymore .
i' m rizzo .
de vita and spagna .
who was the corporal ?
part of the command company .
boys , take a look around .
i found this .
he became sand .
it happens .
we' il report it .
you used up your first miracle .
just got here and already used up a miracle .
what miracle ?
that' s enough .
let' s go .
is that good water ?
yes .
stay low .
set yourself up there , a guy from padua used to be here ... he got hit by a grenade splinter .
it literally pierced his stomach .
is he dead ?
the war is over for him .
he' s in a hospital in bengasi .
they will send him home soon .
come , i' il brief you .
to the right , the qattara depression .
not much to worry about .
there' s a minefield past the barbed wire , then no man' s land .
the british are over there , you can' t see them .
but they see us clearly and send their 88' s here .
keep low during the day , we move at night .
our artillery ?
the remaining cannons are in the north .
we' re in the south sector , abandoned by god .
keep your head low .
if you get dysentery don' t report sick , we all have it .
just cope with it .
vipers and scorpions .
watch where you put your hands and when you put on your shoes ... because scorpions look for warm places at night .
a quarter liter of water a day .
if you' re used to washing up , learn how to do it with sand .
rations arrive after dusk , but often don' t show up .
you' il have to make do with canned goods and biscuits .
cigarettes in abundance , but matches are scarce .
got that ?
yes .
any questions ?
the mail ?
on and off .
beloved mom , dear father ...
i' ve finally arrived on the front line .
my unit is posted in the southernmost point of the front ... near the qattara depression .
i' m the youngest .
the others are veterans of africa .
everything is empty , immense .
i' ve yet to see real war .
it' s not what i expected .
clashes , battles , gunfights .
our real enemies now are thirst and dysentery .
we must be careful ... because we can die suddenly , unexpectedly ... without ever seeing the enemy .
i hope i' il distinguish myself and make you proud of me .
spagna , where the fuck are you ?
everything okay ?
yes , lieutenant .
if that had hit our pit , goodbye homeland .
lieutenant .
how' s it going ?
fine .
well , they keep getting closer .
lieutenant , two wounded in the connection zone .
hit by 88' s ?
no , by a sniper .
what ?
let' s go .
what happened ?
the two linemen were adjusting the telephone cables ... and they were shot by a sniper .
how did he get there ?
we don' t know .
he must have arrived last night .
he wasn' t there yesterday .
stretcher bearers !
where is he ?
perhaps behind those wrecks .
lieutenant , sir .
do you feel like going ?
yes .
be careful .
he may disregard your armbands .
we' il go anyway .
run !
hide !
he got him .
did you see where he' s shooting from ?
i saw a spark from behind that truck .
are you sure ?
yes .
i saw him clearly .
we need the mortar .
who' il go call tarozzi ?
me .
go to the command post , get him , and bring him here .
he needs to bring his 81 , hurry .
stay low and always run for cover !
where' s tarozzi ?
over there .
who' s tarozzi ?
me .
lt. fiore needs you , hurry .
you called for me ?
set up the mortar .
ready .
come here .
see that wreck ?
yes .
there' s a sniper in there , blow it to pieces .
yes , sir .
cover !
you son of a bitch !
go to hell !
don' t shoot !
damn you !
to hell !
don' t waste ammunition !
bastards !
listen ... shall we blow up this son of a bitch ?
yes , sir .
see what he did to our boys ?
yes , sir .
then concentrate and send him straight to hell .
got it ?
i' il get him , i swear .
cover !
get the wounded man and take him to the infirmary .
fix the cables .
good job , tarozzi .
let' s go .
you' re a champ .
what a sight .
they remind me of my town' s fireworks .
the rations arrived today .
tasty sand and rice mush .
know why rations arrive at night ?
so we can' t see all the flies in the food .
when do you think we' il attack ?
when will we get to alexandria , to cairo ?
maybe you don' t get it .
we' ve been here four months and haven' t advanced a meter .
cairo , the pyramids , we can forget about them .
you' ve become an expert on military strategies ?
it' s common sense .
our provisions are in libya , bengasi and derna .
that' s 1, 000 kilometers from here .
we' re far from everything that' s why nothing arrives on the front line .
but the british bases are nearby .
they switch off every 15 days .
they take leave and go have fun .
rommel isn' t just any guy ... he whipped the british pretty badly .
if he made it this far , why can' t he advance some more ?
if he stopped , something must have happened .
supplies and ammunition haven' t arrived .
gas hasn' t arrived and neither has water .
i think the british will attack soon .
even if they do , they won' t get through here .
they won' t kick us out .
firm , solid , immovable ... neither forward ... nor backward .
sergeant , what do you think ?
that you talk too much .
once you start thinking , you' re dead .
just do as you' re told .
and if i have to die ...
i' il die .
that i won' t surrender .
they won' t take me ... not alive .
what is it ?
a british truck .
it drove over a mine .
let' s go .
where ?
to do some shopping .
there are mines here .
stay in line behind me .
i don' t want to have to scrape you off the ground .
sergeant .
what ?
i stepped on something .
don' t move .
stay still .
you lucked out .
move .
slowly .
it' s an anti tank mine .
they' re calibrated for 300 kilos .
if it was an anti personnel mine , you' d be gone .
christ , be careful .
you used up your second miracle .
damn .
what do we have here ?
look .
these british have it all .
chocolate , whiskey , jam ...
everything , even canned fruit .
sergeant , he' s alive !
what' il we do ?
the british will come get him , they' il handle it .
let' s hurry up .
come on , let' s go .
serra , move it .
good stuff .
want some ?
british vitamins .
all this talk about miracles ... what is it ?
look at this .
it was on my head .
a bullet entered here and exited here .
i could have died .
but i didn' t ...
i felt ... a breeze through my hair .
what would you call that ?
when you step on a mine that doesn' t explode ... grenade splinters hit the pit ... and the guy next to you dies ... these are miracles .
the corporal turned to sand , you didn' t even get a scratch .
that was your first miracle .
here , we are each allotted three miracles .
you' ve only got one left .
afterwards all you can do is pray .
and you , how many do you have left ?
we used them up long ago .
don' t worry ... if you' re going to die , it shows the day before .
how can you tell ?
your nose becomes thin and long ... and your ears , transparent like tissue paper .
you' re pulling my leg , right ?
good morning , lieutenant .
what have you got there ?
where are we ?
naqb rala , south sector , why ?
i knew i' d get lost .
damn !
these trails are all alike , nothing but fucking sand .
these aren' t supply trucks ?
no , special transport .
i' m supposed to go to el daba ... but i had to change route because of a bombardment .
el daba is on the northern coast , at least 80 kilometers away .
it' s full of shoe polish .
what ?
for the parade , when we reach alexandria .
what' s in this truck ?
a horse .
mussolini' s , for the parade .
we could roast it with potatoes .
you can' t touch it , i have to bring it back .
then say the british took it as a prisoner .
do something , you tell them .
you keep this .
i' m confiscating the horse .
pull it out .
you can' t , it' s mussolini' s horse .
if anything happens , they' il shoot me .
bullshit .
tell them i took it , they can come to me .
open up .
it really is mussolini' s personal horse ...
i swear .
you don' t get it .
tell mussolini we' ve been eating sand and drinking piss for months .
if he wants to march in alexandria with his horse and shiny boots ... he' s got to send us arms , uniforms ... water , shoes , food , medicine , and fresh troops to replace us .
he has to send the air force to bomb the british .
forget about shoe shines .
got it ?
who' s going to kill it ?
who' s going to kill it ?
sorry , you' re a beauty but we' re in bad shape .
take it , get lost .
beloved mom , dear father , today we' re moving .
the lieutenant is sending us behind the front to get bins of water .
after weeks of being stuck in the pits ... riding in the desert tastes like freedom .
we seem to smell the sea .
it' s 60 kilometers away ... but for us , it' s more unreachable than a mirage .
camel plains , dove hills ...
gazelle cliff .
but they are mere dots on the map that only the bedouins can recognize .
are we lost ?
no .
know where we are ?
more or less .
it' s all the same here ... even the names ...
qaret el khadim , qattaret el diyura ...
qaret el yidma .
all the same .
they said there were palm trees , but i don' t see any .
we should be near , try that way .
there they are .
no one' s here .
are you from the pavia division ?
yes , that' s us .
i thought you got lost .
it' s all yours .
tastes like diesel !
tanks we stole from the germans .
we have to drink diesel tainted water ?
you should thank god i brought them .
how long since you' ve gotten a water supply ?
seems you' re not doing well .
we can' t drink this water , we' re not animals !
enough , let' s unload it .
all wasted water .
know how many i' ve transported through this desert ?
thousands of tanks , and what for ?
to rinse the generals ' underwear .
then they complain we don' t move forward or backward .
bullshit !
i' ve got a solution .
what ?
if i transported grappa ... we' d be at the pyramids by now .
in wwl , we italians along the piave river ... were all drunk , otherwise , like hell would we have won .
i feel generous today .
drink , men are supposed to drink wine .
use the water for the truck radiators .
spagna , how long since you' ve had a bath ?
do i smell ?
sure , we all stink !
i asked because ... about 40 kilometers from here ... is the sea .
how would you feel about a swim ?
are you crazy ?
we' il dive in and leave .
then they' il court martial us all .
let' s vote .
shall we go or not ?
let' s go .
shall we go ?
yes !
sure , fuck it !
why don' t we stay here ?
we' il hide away and wait here for the end of the war .
hey , what are you doing ?
who are you ?
pavia division , we' re on a mission .
that' s a mined area .
get out of there !
sergeant , is what they say true ?
what do they say ?
that the british took you as prisoner and you managed to flee .
they caught me when bengasi fell .
they brought us to a pow camp in egypt .
some were glad ... because they figured the war was over for them .
being a prisoner is horrible for a soldier .
it' s humiliating ... it' s a non life .
a soldier' s duty is to fight , a prisoner' s is to flee .
i didn' t want to rot away in kenya or india .
i managed to go back to bengasi .
the british were still there .
for three months i hid out at a friend' s place ... in a brothel .
it was the best time of my life .
then when we liberated bengasi ...
i went back to my troop .
how long have you been in africa ?
two years .
you never went back to italy ?
no .
this is a cursed place .
you boil in the day , and freeze at night .
but what a sky .
i' d never seen a sky like this .
the desert plays with you ... makes you think strange things .
i' m sure of one thing .
when we go home ... if we save our hides ... we' il miss this wretched place .
the minefields , the sand , the pits ...
everything .
we' il miss hunger and thirst .
it' s cooked .
a brush of oil and rosemary .
lieutenant , want some ?
fire up two steaks !
what is this stuff ?
camel steaks .
where did they come from ?
serra did it .
wait .
what does that mean ?
weren' t you on lookout today ?
yes , sir .
tell me exactly where you found the camel .
right in front of me .
at the lookout point ?
yes , near there .
christ .
show me .
here ?
there , see the blood ?
how was it killed ?
i shot it .
isn' t this supposed to be a mined area ?
i believe so .
how did the camel get here without blowing up ?
i don' t know .
the camel didn' t come here by chance .
the british sent it into the minefield .
if it doesn' t blow up , that means it' s safe .
we have to check the area .
what' s the situation ?
it' s all de mined here .
there' s a clear path of at least five meters here .
can you close the gap ?
we' il try .
any news from command ?
we' ve been cut off , we know nothing .
they say the british are preparing an attack .
it' s a matter of days .
they' re waiting for the full moon .
this time , it' il be a major attack .
we keep finding de mined areas along the front .
which sector will they attack ?
they say to be on guard .
they saw heavy movement of vehicles and troops .
our command is moving the ariete tanks toward the north .
but that' il leave our rear uncovered .
if they attack with tanks , how will we stop them ?
that' s what i heard .
call us if you need us .
thanks .
you called for me , sir ?
rizzo , sit down .
this arrived .
we' re on general alert .
after that de mined area ... they asked me to send a unit to check the depression .
the depression ?
they want to be sure the enemy won' t attack through the depression .
that' s impossible .
the depression is impassable , even for bedouins .
it says here to send some men to verify .
you must find out what happened to the bersaglieri unit ... which was posted on look out .
they haven' t reported back in days .
got it ?
good .
get one of your men and leave right away .
all right .
lf we encounter the enemy ?
leave immediately .
units are only useful if they return .
yes , lieutenant .
good luck .
know why i chose you ?
because you' re the youngest , you' re a volunteer ... and the last to arrive .
we' re below sea level here , right ?
according to the map we' re at 70 below .
it' s an oven , it must be at least 50 degrees celsius .
don' t think about it .
the more you think about it , the hotter it feels .
how far have we gone ?
about 12 kilometers .
sergeant , what is it ?
it' s a mirage .
they call it morgan le fay .
what shitty shoes .
i got blisters all over .
what is it ?
i wonder who drew these .
once , this area was all green .
there was water , trees , animals ...
when the ancient romans were here ?
long before that ... at least 10, 000 years ago .
10, 000 ?
i can' t even imagine a number like that .
studying teaches you lots of things .
i finished elementary school , i can read and write ... but that' s it .
at age 10 , i was in the hills with the cows .
know what i miss most ?
the green fields behind my house .
there' s a plum tree .
i sit under it ... and look up .
know how to ski ?
no .
back home , the first snow has already fallen .
see anyone ?
no , no one .
nothing .
what if the british are there ?
they' il shoot at us .
if the british made it here , they can make it anywhere .
they' re more bedouin than the bedouins .
what will we do now ?
we' il go back .
is today the 23rd ?
what ?
is it october 23rd ?
yes .
why ?
it' s my wife' s birthday .
how old is she ?
30 .
i haven' t seen her in two years .
i wonder if she' d recognize me .
that' s the north .
those are our posts .
these aren' t the usual 88' s .
let' s go .
de vita .
what are you doing ?
fixing the case .
it' s all broken .
how are you ?
fine .
what happened to you ?
nothing , why ?
your hair turned white .
really ?
where' s spagna ?
spagna ...
spagna , how are you ?
it came down like hail .
what happened to de vita ?
a grenade landed three meters from him , made a huge hole , but he' s fine .
not a scratch , just his hair .
how many boys did we lose ?
at least 20 , between dead and injured .
what we expected has happened , the battle has begun .
the british attacked the entire front .
they bombed us , but they didn' t attack with tanks and infantry .
they tried to break through the folgore sector .
they suffered great losses there ... entire companies destroyed ... but they held their position .
they stopped the tanks with incendiary bottles .
an attack is expected tonight , with the full moon .
our 28th is with ruspoli' s group at point 105 .
they want us to go there .
a gap has opened , they want us to patch it .
are they sending us to croak , sir ?
who are you ?
pavia division .
i' m lt. fiore .
lt. sforza of folgore , we were waiting for you .
how' s your situation here ?
last night was a nightmare .
the british bashed us .
the 19th is gone , the 22nd has few remaining defense posts ... and the 6th is surrounded .
we don' t know how long they' il hold up .
we stopped them by burning about 30 british tanks .
they told us to reinforce ruspoli' s group at point 105 .
ruspoli' s gone , he died this afternoon .
an 88 hit his truck , three officers died .
one from the pavia division .
what should we do ?
take post at point 115 , between the 24th and 20th .
one of my soldiers will bring you there .
are there tanks ?
they promised us the ariete tanks and the german panzers ... but we can only count on our forces now .
you three with the breda , in here .
tarozzi , there with the mortar .
three more in there .
serra , de vita , in here .
find some sacks and rebuild the wall .
you two , in here .
rizzo , there .
you two , in here , set up the pit .
spagna , get three men and stay here .
boys , come here .
three more with me .
take these sandbags .
you two , in here .
de vita , here .
you all , in here .
you three , over here .
remove what you don' t need from the pits .
distribute the ammunition .
de vita , knock it off !
i' m fixing it .
fix it some other time .
fine .
i brought some amphetamines .
so you' il stay awake .
get down !
de vita !
where the fuck are you going ?
come back here !
finally , war , the real kind , has arrived .
i kept an eye on it , like a bus on the corner of a street .
the british broke through the first line ... but they were stopped by the artillery .
they got stuck in the minefields and had to turn back .
maybe this was the third miracle .
today i looked horror in the face .
lucky is he who dies a hero .
i' ve seen many of these heroes .
those who die are neither lucky nor unlucky .
they are just dead .
they rot at the bottom of a pit ... without a shred of poetry .
death is beautiful only in school books .
in real life it' s pitiful , horrendous ... and it stinks .
this time , i' m going home .
of course .
they' il even give you a medal .
if you' re lucky , it' il happen to you , too .
see you back in italy .
see you in italy .
write to me , sergeant .
got it ?
write to me .
what do they say ?
ii duce deems it necessary to maintain the front at all costs .
win or die .
the big battle moved up north .
it overthrew us like a flooded river .
then , once the flood passed ... it all went back to normal .
it seems they' ve all forgotten about us .
our enemies and our command .
the days pass , always the same .
we don' t know what will happen to us .
we' ve become rocks , boulders ... immobile , hard .
fear no longer exists , because life no longer exists .
we know we can' t win .
we' re alone , in the middle of the desert .
alone with our sins .
it' s all one great light with no dimensions , no size .
it' s all a blinding light ... immense , infinite .
the british broke through up north , the ariete division was destroyed .
and the germans ?
they lost almost all of their armored divisions .
rommel decided to retreat , he wants to save the afrika korps .
what are our orders ?
what' il we do ?
disengage and establish a new line of defense ... 30 kilometers from here , at qaret el khadim .
the folgore division , too ?
no .
we' re at gebel kalakh .
they stationed us as rearguards .
let' s hope for the best .
they say " disengagement " but they mean " retreat .
maybe we' il get our hides home safely .
are they sending trucks ?
no , there are none .
we' il have to make do .
may god help us .
look !
the germans !
stop !
italians , you' il die here !
damn germans !
italians !
stop .
stop , for god' s sake !
not even the holy spirit could fit in here !
there' s plenty of room !
we' re full !
let us in !
son of a bitch !
general .
lt. fiore , 27th pavia infantry ... at your orders .
at ease .
can we be of help ?
no , i don' t need anything .
we can dig .
he was my orderly for 15 years , i want to bury him myself .
you' re not wounded ?
no .
we' re retreating to qaret el khadim .
want us to send a vehicle for you ?
thank you .
take cover with your men , don' t worry about me .
yes , sir .
whom did i have the honor of speaking to ?
it doesn' t matter anymore .
good luck .
thanks , your excellency .
i want my shoe back !
here it is !
it' s all over , you can go home .
you' re going home .
good evening , lieutenant .
where are you going ?
to qaret el khadim .
this is it .
where' s command ?
there isn' t one , it' s a hospital .
they told us to come here .
the british are everywhere , we' ve been ordered to retreat to fuka .
how will we get to fuka ?
that truck is leaving soon .
get on and leave the injured behind .
what will you do ?
i' m staying here .
we' re waiting for the british .
they' il take better care of them .
good luck .
tarozzi !
hello , serra .
lieutenant .
how are you ?
here' s how i am .
stop !
calm down , there' s a shelter !
there it is .
we' re there .
stop , you can' t enter !
they' re shooting , we' ve got injured men .
you can' t go in !
understand ?
you don' t understand , we won' t stay out in this bullet storm .
look !
what a mess !
christ !
lieutenant ?
yes , sir .
where are you going ?
retreating to fuka , taking the injured to the hospital .
good .
make sure they get better soon ... and go back to the front line as soon as possible .
aren' t we retreating ?
this is an active war , sometimes we go forward , sometimes we go back .
it' s a strategic retreat , temporary .
reinforcements are arriving .
colonel !
we don' t have a vehicle .
will you send one for the injured men ?
sure , will do .
an italian soldier never loses hope .
if he' s willing , he' il always find a way .
shall we go ?
stop !
we' ve come from qaret el khadim .
they told us to go to fuka .
the british are in fuka .
the 10th army corps should gather at marsa matruh .
but that' s 100 kilometers away !
we don' t have a vehicle , we' ve got injured men .
those are the orders .
i' il go look for the rest of the column .
we proceed haphazardly .
commands and countermands .
no one knows what' s happening , what to do .
we wander through the desert fending for ourselves .
we can only hope something will happen ... anything that will put an end ... to the humiliation of this endless end .
lieutenant , how' s the wound ?
fine .
want to eat something ?
we have some extra canned goods .
no , thanks .
serra .
it' s the last one ?
eat .
i don' t sleep near corpses .
it' s not right .
it' s not right .
this is a cemetery .
will we make it back home ?
we' il make it .
italian soldiers , command has abandoned you .
the war is over for you , surrender !
put down your weapons .
don' t resist .
lieutenant !
i' il help you .
look !
maybe they' re ours .
start .
start !
lieutenant , there' s water .
seems to work .
there' s gasoline !
sergeant , help me pull it out !
it won' t start .
start !
it' s pointless .
start !
it started !
i told you so !
maybe we' il make it .
we won' t make it .
i won' t make it .
you go .
find a vehicle and come back for me .
i' il wait here .
sergeant , let' s go !
i' il help you .
get on that bike .
get on that bike .
i' il stay here .
the lieutenant can' t stand up .
you go without me .
