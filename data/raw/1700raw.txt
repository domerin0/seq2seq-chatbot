<i>looked like leonard was trying</ i> <i>to get the breaking pitch inside ... </ i> <i> ... but it just didn' t have</ i> <i>any break on it that time . </ i>
agent mackelway , we' re over here .
i was gonna introduce you two , but i understand that won' t be necessary .
seems your former office decided we needed help ... ... so they sent us agent kulok .
hey , tom .
hi , fran .
i guess we' re gonna skip the tearful reunion .
have a seat , tom .
how are things in dallas ?
wouldn' t really know .
i' ve been chained to a desk .
okay , what do we know ?
picked up a footprint in the back seat .
a size and a half bigger than speck' s .
okay .
wounds on speck' s throat indicate he was strangled from behind .
i think our guy was waiting for him in the back seat ... ... sprung this on him once the car was moving .
lab picked up talcum traces along the edges ... ... consistent with powdered gloves .
so he gets this dropped in his lap ... ... it spooks him , car ends up in the ravine .
that car was pushed to the state line .
the depth of the tire tracks ... ... footprints near the embankment .
that car wasn' t going more than 3 miles an hour ... ... and it stopped literally on the state line .
guy must have used gps .
why would he push it to the state line ?
same reason he did everything else , to get the fbl' s undivided attention .
there' s an association here .
you have a circle ... ... and a lidless eye that' s always open .
seeing .
seeing .
or making sure that we' re seeing .
it' s just a feeling .
he was a normal guy .
you know , kind of quiet .
he liked to read fishing magazines , and he wasn' t much of a tipper .
is that a lousy thing to say ?
no , it' s fine .
could you tell us about the other man ?
like i said , i never really saw him .
harold came up complaining about the guy ... ... but by the time i turned around , he was gone .
can you desc ... ?
desc
can you describe him , ma' am ?
oh , sure .
you could tell he wasn' t from around here .
did you see what he was driving ?
you know , now that you mention it ... ... there' s a torino out in the parking lot with a real crappy paint job .
it' s been here since last night .
we need a protocol for interviewing witnesses .
fine .
i' il handle it .
always in control .
tell you something , tom ... ... i want my life back , so i want this over quick .
so , what happened ?
your ring .
it didn' t work out ... ... just like us .
so why are you here ?
you vacationing in albuquerque ?
oh , tom , you sure haven' t changed in six whole months .
keys are in the car .
i don' t need a babysitter ... ... so let' s do it right this time .
then don' t make things so unnecessarily complicated again .
trunk' s ajar .
you listening to me ?
you think i wanna be down here ?
i' m not interested in hanging out ... ... and i' m not your babysitter .
i' m your partner .
i didn' t put you here , remember .
and i' m not going through this again with you .
holy shit .

this guy started in oklahoma , left these for us .
mrs. speck ... ... i just heard .

hello ?
fucking freak !
what a fucking freak .
can i help you ?
why didn' t you report it as stolen ?
the truth is , i always hated that car .
nobody but benjamin could ever make it run right .
is that his name , benjamin ?
it' s hard to say .
that' s what he liked to be called .
this bad wiring .
i think we' ve got an obsessive compulsive here .
i' il call grieves .
get him to work up a list of behaviourists for us to talk to .
give me that .
excuse me .
these came from benjamin ?
he used to spend hours down here .
it was like ...
like his office .
what are these ?
with those numbers and pictures , he said he could find anybody .
benjamin o' ryan ?
special agent benjamin o' ryan , fbl .
it was his fantasy .
oh , fuck .

raymond starkey .
starkey did this ?
tom , starkey' s the guy on the ground .
you son of a bitch ... ... why are you baiting me ?
you want me to see what you see .
you want me to see .
i' m trying to see it .
i' m trying to see it .
he opens up an old wound .
yeah .
what does he want ?
i don' t know .
maybe he' s got something against law enforcement ... ... like the zodiac .
you' re welcome , tom .
you' re welcome , tom .
not fbl .
tom .
he' s baiting me .
he wants me .
why ?
what does he want ?
okay .
tom , i want you to take me through this .
explain this to me .
okay .
see if this makes sense to you , okay ?
each of the 45 abduction dates on these faxes correspond ... ... to one of the gps coordinates on o' ryan' s map .
what about the two bodies we id' d ?
okay .
well , let' s find the faxes .
here we go .
male victim .
last seen , trenton , new jersey .
okay .
found in dyersville , iowa .
okay .
female .
last seen , dayton , ohio .
found in brownsville , texas .
so we have two bodies ... ... that were found 1000 miles from where they were last seen .
what' s this ?
that' s tucumcari , new mexico .
why blue ?
that' s the only city where the date on the fax and the map didn' t correspond .
christmas .
on o' ryan' s map , 8 27 .
the only thing we know is there never was a benjamin o' ryan , fbl .
he would have made a hell of an agent .
autopsy reports just arrived for both the new positive ids .
bruises ?
no , they' re burn marks .
we' ve got them here too on our female from dayton .
and these marks relate to the marks found on fulcher and speck how ?
they don' t .
there were no burn marks on speck , fulcher or starkey .
and we have no slash circles here on these bodies .
right .
my office , as soon as someone finds something useful .
no luck on the behavioural specialists .
i do have a couple other leads that i' m following up on .
i' m hopeful they' re gonna pan out .
great , thank you .
a professor of criminal biology , professor daitz , just called .
he says he' s got time for you on saturday .
thank you , katie .
i was operating under the assumption that o' ryan was somebody' s fantasy .
oh , no , he' s real .
he was a student of mine .
that fax you sent me , this circle with the slash through it ?
that' s his construct , his theory .
he called it " suspect zero .
suspect zero ?
he posited a theory that a serial killer ... ... could cross the entire country without ever getting caught .
what makes a killer catchable ?
patterns , repetition of behaviour .
he imagined someone with no patterns ... ... no telltale fetishes , no rituals ... ... just a random killing machine that never leaves a clue .
but a serial killer by definition is condemned to repetition .
i mean , isn' t that what he' s all about ?
well , he is until he isn' t .
and this suspect zero , is that something that you believe in , doctor ?
it' s something o' ryan believed in .
he swore guys like that existed , only we couldn' t see them ... ... because they didn' t obey the usual laws , like cancer doesn' t ... ... or the hlv virus that tricks your immune system ... ... into thinking it isn' t there .
so you' re saying a guy like that could exist ?
do you know the definition of a black hole ?
not precisely , no .
it' s a celestial body with a gravitational force so strong ... ... that nothing escapes it .
not even light .
well , then how do you find something you can' t see ?
well , it was there and we found it .
why do you think o' ryan is convinced a person like that is around ?
in this time and place .
what about a split personality ?
could you have a stone cold killer on one hand ... ... and a thoughtful man with a conscience on the other ?
i mean , could o' ryan ... ... possibly be this suspect zero ?
yeah .
it' s a viable theory .
i mean , the point is , i don' t think you' re gonna know until you find o' ryan .
<i>point is , i don' t think you' re</ i> <i>gonna know until you find o' ryan . </ i>
<i>just a random killing machine</ i> <i>that never leaves a clue . </ i>
yes , lord .
yes , lord .
sing it , lord .

yeah , fran , i need somebody to talk to .
it' s driving me crazy .

fulcher , a schoolteacher from boulder and then starkey .

you got one of those pins in deming ?
o' ryan was spotted there yesterday .
he took a squad car and a sidearm off a highway patrolman .
about an hour later a 5 year old boy was abducted a mile up the interstate .
we also found the bodies of two females in a dumpster off the highway .
your boy' s been busy .
we' re establishing a perimeter around the city .
was the patrolman hurt ?
what' s the difference ?
he wasn' t , was he ?
he was fine .
the girls in the dumpster had fatal injuries .
o' ryan' s not the guy .
he' s chasing the guy or that patrolman would be dead .
can i ship this guy back to dallas ?
o' ryan was fbl , you ever heard of a project called icarus ?
no .
have you ?
it' s agents trained to see distant locations ... ... using only the mind .
they call it remote viewing .
bureau stole it from the army .
they use it to track down serial killers .
what ?
you don' t believe me ?
it' s bullshit ?
it' s voodoo ?
it worked .
they made a science of it .
that' s how he drew this .
he' d never been in this house ... ... he just saw what was there .
the bureau taught him ... ... and he' s using it to track suspect zero .
you know what ?
i' m extremely tired of that term .
profile the guy .
he' s straight out of quantico .
he' s working like we would .
he' s not kidnapping , he' s chasing the guy ... ... that' s doing the kidnapping .
look at the map .
okay .
what you' re telling me is all these abductions are the work of one guy .
yes .
mac , do you realize how insane that is ?
fran , please help me .
he' s not listening to me .
tom , i' m not sure that you' re seeing things very clearly right now .
tom ... ... let' s just try something that actually makes sense .
this guy sends in these faxes .
he picks off three scumbags .
why ?
so that we' il think what you' re thinking , that we got a friend .
somebody who' s willing to take out the trash for us , and it' s horseshit .
what if it isn' t ?
what if there is a suspect zero , and o' ryan' s the one guy who' s got a shot ?
for fuck' s sake , mackelway .
when did you start buying into this guy ?
well , he' s smarter than we are .
speak for yourself .
i' m going to deming .
you can take the rest of the day off .
<i>i' il be damned . </ i>
kulok here .
<i> hey . </ i>
where are you ?
i' m headed towards tucumcari .
listen , those marks on the bodies , could they be freezer burns ?
let me get into this .
yeah .
there' s crystallization because the blood never clotted .
freezer burn .
he keeps the bodies in a freezer and buries them 1000 miles apart ?
hey , tom , what' s going on ?
i got a possible suspect .
that kid' s been a brat all morning .
i turned around ...
see what you caused ?
are you afraid ?
it' d be custom here at this point to start praying .
i see a lot of that .
haven' t heard too many answers though .
you' re alone .
come on .
are you afraid ?
where' s the boy ?
my , my !
must be extremely satisfying to hear yourself say something so heroic .
i' m almost envious .
the boy' s in pieces under the bed .
now are you afraid ?
i know what you' re thinking , " pain is coming .
will i take it like a man .
let me put you at ease , you won' t .
none of them do .
men , women , children , they all weep , they all beg .
they pass out , piss themselves , attempt negotiations .
you wouldn' t believe how many men i' ve seen where you are .
grown men with wives and children at home ... ... offering sexual gratification for a five minute reprieve .
it' s pathetic .
are you afraid ?
when they realize there' s nothing left to negotiate , and they' re helpless ...
well , the look in their eyes , the level of surrender ... ... it' s almost pornographic .
i put that mirror here because i didn' t want you to miss it .
are you afraid ?
look in the mirror .
are you afraid ?
look in the mirror .
are you afraid ?
look in the mirror , o' ryan .
hey , you , fucking mackelway .
look at yourself , look in the mirror .
are you afraid , mackelway ?
look at yourself .
are you afraid ? !
no , i' m not afraid .
open your eyes !
open your eyes , goddamn it ... ... or i' il cut the fucking lids off !
then cut the fucking lids off !
<i>the initiation used to be more civil . </ i>
<i>i' m sorry about that . </ i>
<i>you' re part of it now . </ i>
there were five of us , you know .
the most skilled ... ... technical remote viewers on project icarus .
you come in in the morning , have a cup of coffee , talk about the yankees .
you go to your room with your pen ... ... and your pad of paper , always alone .
you try and lock in , you crank out an ideogram .
son of sam , john wayne gacy , ted bundy .
he might be driving his car , having a beer , brushing his teeth ... ... cutting someone' s eyes out .
if you did it right , you got it all .
the way it sounded , the way it smelled .
those people were looking right up at you , begging you for mercy .
it was like being god .
but , of course , you' re not god .
can' t do a thing for them .
they wired us into this current , the five of us ... ... darkness , the pit itself .
we were plugged right into it , and no one taught us how to turn it off .
we saw things men shouldn' t see .
agony ... ... torture ... ... evil .
it never shut off .
i checked once with all the guys that' d ... ... been on the project when it was just used for intel .
you know , finding gun runners and drug lords , soviet missile sites ... ... even the iran hostages .
anyway , i checked with them , and they' re all okay .
but the five of us ... ... plugged into the brains and nervous systems of human beings ... ... that' s when we lost it .
we' re all either dead or institutionalised .
after a while , those conversations about the yankees became impossible .
o' ryan .
those faxes ... ... the missings ... ... how many of them are his ?
all of them .
you were the missing piece , mac .
now everything is in place .
all you have to do is finish it .
this is mackelway .
i' m travelling north , approaching l 54 at tucumcari , request backup .
i' m pursuing a possible suspect in a refrigerated truck .
brake !
hey , tom !
tom !
get the trailer open !
there' s a kid in the trailer .
hey , buddy .
you okay ?
i got you , okay ?
okay , come here .
i got you .
get an ambulance .
yes , ma' am .
i knew i was right about you .
no .
no , that wasn' t me .
of course it was you .
wasn' t me .
wasn' t the wind .
you beat him to death .
now all you have to do is finish it .
finish it !
understand , none of this was arbitrary .
we were chosen , you and i.
it' s not a bad start , mac .
you made the world a little safer .
we made justice .
this wasn' t justice .
yes , it was !
and so is this .
i' m not going to kill you , o' ryan .
you already have .
i' ve seen it a thousand times .
no , you saw wrong .
that' s impossible !
i saw us here .
i saw all of it !
me baiting you , testing you !
look at him !
you' ve arrived !
you' re cursed , like me ... ... only you keep running from it !
you hear things , you see things ... ... that' s why you can' t sleep .
why your head always aches .
get up .
get up .
there is no zero .
you' re confused , old man .
can' t you see that ?
you think we did something mythical here today ?
you think we put an end to evil ?
we killed a deviant , that' s all .
there are thousands of them out there .
o' ryan , you' re a guy with a skill .
you' re not god .
you can' t see everything .
you don' t decide what' s justice .
freeze !
please , mac .
i can' t sleep anymore .
i keep seeing all those faces .
the ones i couldn' t save .
all those missings .
you know , they never blink .
they' re all in here .
i want you to shut it off for me .
please , mac , i' m so tired .
i just want you to shut it off for me .
shut it off for me .
i can' t .
i' m not you .
yet .
so tired .
so tired .
thank you .
