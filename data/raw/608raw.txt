excellent match , mr. vardon .
well played .
would you like to have dinner tonight ?
i' m sorry .
i have a previous engagement .
he' s on the verge .
i can feel it .
a putt here or there makes all the difference .
ln a word  the word is " vanity .
i have a grandson who is well equipped ... for the rigors of commerce , and yet you allow him ... to dissipate his powers in the presence of idle men .
my son is a grown man , papa .
i have never dictated to him the things that shall make him happy .
and i won' t start now .
why do you defy me ... and allow in your son what i wouldn' t allow in you ?
because he is my son !
he is my only son , and there' s greatness in him .
i can see it even if you can' t .
angus , this damn wind .
i can' t believe how hard it blows .
even the crows are walking .
who made this course ?
a glacier , 15, 000 years ago .
do you know the definition of " insanity , " laddie ?
when you keep doing the same bloody thing and expect to get different results .
angus , i hate this course .
it' s a god forsaken cow patch .
an old woman with a croquet mallet could play this hole in three .
i' ve done it in two .
laddie , you did wrong .
you can be forgiven for losing but not for quitting .
there won' t come a day when it shall be forgotten that bonny bobby gave up .
not by them , mind you .
but by you !
i heard about what happened today .
the old course gave you a thrashing , did she ?
that' s her duty .
they were playing golf here when they still thought the world was flat .
all i really want to say is ... don' t give up on her .
she' s the grandest course there is .
hopefully , some day you' il see .
i' ve been playing golf for 35 years ...
i' ve never seen anyone play it with more grace .
whatever you do , don' t stop hitting the ball .
honey , honey , hear that tone
honey , honey , hear that tone
on that slippery slide trombone
baby beautiful
tutti fruttiful
please don' t blow that home , sweet home
mister , don' t you ever waste a fancy telephone
slide , slide , when i glide , glide , glide
to the music of the slide trombone
he looks sluggish .
he played well this morning .
don' t worry , colonel .
i think he' s ready .
he learned his lesson at st. andrews .
i' m picking him to win it all .
hell , grantland , everybody is .
ls it me , or does he look like he' s limping ?
oh , god , no .
he' s gonna go for it .
son of a bitch !
are you okay ?
are you all right , ma' am ?
i' m so sorry .
i didn' t mean to do that .
it' s all right .
i' m fine .
really , i' m fine .
i' m sorry .
it is from george walker himself .
you want me to read it again ?
you will never play in another usga event ...
until you can learn to control your temper .
do you understand what this means ?
sit down !
i' m not finished yet .
son ...
i know how difficult this is for you .
the pressure .
i understand this entire town is rooting for you .
betting on me .
you have to forget about all that .
forget about those other guys .
you have all the talent in the world .
it is time for you to step up and be a man !
lf i win , does that make me a man ?
ls that what it takes ?
come back here .
what' s the matter with your leg ?
robert , what' s the matter ?
my god .
how long has it been like this ?
weeks .
camilla , call the doctor !
varicose veins .
at his age .
i keep thinking back to merion ... when he was 1 4 .
there was so much promise .
you' re disappointed in him .
i didn' t say that .
you didn' t have to .
dear mr. walker , i want to formally apologize to you ... and usga for my behavior in st. louis this fall .
i want to assure you that in the future , i will act with all civility .
and that i will never again show ill temper in any way , shape , or form on a golf course .
you have my word on this .
yours sincerely , robert tyre jones , jr .
he speaks six languages .
a little bit closer .
smile , bob .
i saw your son play baseball at georgia .
he was a terrific player .
that would be the poorest compliment you could pay him .
what are your plans , bob ?
will you take up golf professionally ?
you should think about it .
pros are making some big money nowadays .
look at walter hagen .
you' d earn a lot more than any other professional golfer .
i was thinking of enrolling in harvard this fall .
my mother would like me to get a master' s in literature .
but you are gonna play in the major tournaments this summer ?
lsn' t he , colonel ?
that would be up to him .
sir walter ...
i heard he' s broken all 1 1 of the ten commandments .
it' s not true , perry .
he just can' t bring himself to attempt more than six of them at a time .
good morning .
which one of you boys is gonna be second ?
proceed , my good man .
i don' t have all day .
after four rounds at the us open ...
bobby jones and bob cruickshank are tied at 76 .
jones blew a three stroke lead down the stretch ... finishing , in his own words , " like a yellow dog .
cruickshank made two crucial birdies as jones faltered in the second playoff .
bobby jones is the best shot maker in golf ... but it seems he just can' t win .
the playoff tomorrow ....
ldle hands are the devil' s workshop .
walter hagen finished three strokes back .
did you get any sleep ?
did you ?
the betting is 10 to 7 on cruickshank .
he' s got the momentum , coming from behind .
and they' re saying that you' re weak under the belt .
that' s what they' re saying ?
this playoff ... it means a fortune to cruickshank .
you' il just be playing for pride .
this telegram came for you .
what' s it say ?
keep the ball in the fairway ...
and make all the putts go down .
and it' s signed ...
robert tyre jones , sr.
grandfather .
ln case you haven' t realized it yet ... you' re the best golfer in the world .
now , when you get that through your head ... you' re not just gonna win one tournament .
you' re gonna win them all .
ladies and gentlemen , the contest for the 1923 open championship ... will continue with a playoff between ...
mr. robert tyre jones , jr . , and mr. robert cruickshank .
stewart , how you doing ?
good , thanks .
where' s big bob at ?
he thinks he' s a jinx .
he won' t be coming .
good idea .
mr. jones has the honors .
bobby , hit hell out of it .
jones birdied the seventeenth .
they' re even , with one to play .
he should lay up .
well played , bobby .
congratulations .
i' ve finally won a championship .
i don' t care what happens now .
... the goods , at all times , after delivery to coca cola or a transportation company
yes , doris ?
sorry to interrupt , sir , but it' s major cohen of the atlanta journal .
excuse me .
hello , major .
hot damn and hi dee ho !
boys , i think we have a champion .
congratulations .
how long you been selling real estate ?
just a couple of months now .
when' s your next tournament ?
the us open , next month .
but golf is not as important ... as finding the right house for you and your wife .
i think she wants a word with you .
i don' t like this house !
but , honey , this is bobby jones .
who' s better than us ?
you better show me something today , kid .
anyone can win one open .
official .
i caused my ball to move .
y' all didn' t see it move ?
no .
we' ve talked with walter ... all the officials , and several people in the gallery ....
nobody saw your ball move .
it seems a matter for you to decide .
are you sure you caused that ball to move ?
i know i did .
you' re to be congratulated , son .
sir , that' s like congratulating a man for not robbing a bank .
i don' t know how else to play the game .
bobby jones lost the us open by one stroke .
in calling a penalty on himself ... he demonstrated for all of us the highest ideal of sportsmanship ... and personal honor .
i am prouder of him than if he' d won .
there are things finer than winning championships .
nice shot , bob .
beautiful !
that was a beating i' il not soon forget .
come on , let' s go get drunk .
this was billed as the unofficial world championship of golf .
why do you think it was so lopsided a victory ?
when walter had to putt ... he made it every time .
it' s documented that you shun the limelight .
how do you feel being the most famous golfer in the world ?
i don' t think i am .
i think walter' s much more famous than i am .
no , i' m infamous .
i think fame' s overrated , anyway .
they asked enrico caruso what he thought of babe ruth .
he said , " i don' t know , i never heard her sing .
what' s your handicap coming into this season , sir walter ?
same as last year .
drink and debauchery .
i just want to say one thing .
even if he had won today ...
bobby jones would' ve walked away without a dime ... and i would' ve gotten the purse .
now , bob realizes that a professional makes his living out of the game .
and i want the world to know that i appreciate his immense generosity ... in coming here to play in this event .
this is a small token of my esteem .
thank you , bob .
consolation prize .
doesn' t look like it' s going to be a very promising year , does it , bobby ?
not a very promising year for bobby jones ?
i' m here to eat my words , sports fans .
in what has been called the finest golf ever seen in the united kingdom ...
bobby jones has won the british open .
this young man hasn' t played as much golf as your average doctor ... but with his trusty putter , calamity jane , and his driver , jeannie deans ... he' s quickly becoming the greatest to ever play the game .
if he can win the us open later this month ... he' il be the only golfer in history to hold both world titles .
can he do it ?
here' s my advice , sports fans ..
bet the ranch .
if i were famous , for even a day
i won a fortune on you , son !
you' re my hero !
i' d buy and stake
i' m staying at this hotel .
i put a bundle down on you to win the open .
don' t let me down .
can i have your autograph , mr. jones ?
just sign my shirt .
we' re gonna have a bigger party in atlanta !
i' m calling the doctor !
no .
he' s holding in his temper and i think he' s paying the price for it .
he' s wound up tighter than a drum .
all the celebrations , new york , then atlanta , all the travel ....
hell , he hasn' t had any time off since the british open .
and now , with all this pressure ....
i don' t think he should play .
doctor , this is the us open final .
and there' s another one next year .
he' s exhausted , dehydrated .
and frankly , gentlemen ...
i believe he' s suffering from a neurological disorder .
i' m going to run more tests .
look , he' s not gonna win anyway .
he' s , what , six strokes behind ?
i' m going to play .
just give me something for my stomach .
rob , the doctor thinks  just give me something for my stomach .
thank you , doctor .
i' m heading back to the hotel .
there' re still men there with a fair chance of catching you .
i know , but i' ve got to get away from here .
please .
all i ever wanted to be was a normal person .
we can' t undo what' s done , bob .
you have to make a decision .
i did .
i came here to win .
hello ?
yes , would you hold one moment , please ?
my love for you has nothing to do with you winning any championships .
yes , i' il tell him .
you just won the damn thing .
the judge predicted dire consequences if the plaintiffs were to prevail .
these were harsh words by the lower court .
probably bluff .
the appeals court reversed , demanding strict compliance with protective covenants .
even in law , there is virtue in necessity .
your assignment is on the board .
we will cover the common law principle of finds ... which expresses the ancient and honorable principle of finders keepers .
this is a beautiful course .
i don' t know why i couldn' t see it before .
aye .
it' s the true test .
nothing would make me happier than to take home your trophy .
but i cannot .
please honor me by allowing it to be kept here ... at the royal and ancient golf club , where it belongs .
well said , bobby .
hip , hip , hurray !
how rare .
a playoff .
this is grantland rice , bringing you up to the minute details ... of the united states open golf tournament at winged foot .
with one hole to play in the 36 hole playoff ...
bobby jones leads a beleaguered al espinosa by 23 strokes .
i' il go ahead and say it .
this is the most crushing performance ... by a champion in a playoff in the history of golf .
bobby jones has won his third us open ... and his ninth major professional tournament in six years .
he' s so far ahead , no one is second .
and by the by , lucky for all you professional golfers out there ...
bobby jones has passed the bar .
come on , bobby .
cheers .
thanks .
honey , can you just stop that for one second ?
hello ?
hello , honey .
i won .
hello ?
honey ?
that is terrible .
then what did mr. grimes say to you ?
he told me to go to hell .
i think the best course of action for you ... is just to forget about this whole thing .
but he told me to go to hell !
yes , well , i' ve checked the law on that , and ... you don' t have to go .
hi , daddy .
i' ve got something in my pocket .
i wonder what it is .
well , this ... mulligan stew is fantastic .
robert jones , what is on your mind ?
because we know it ain' t my cooking .
i talked to mike mcmahan today .
it would seem that ... the usga wants me to captain the walker cup team .
the british amateur is at st. andrews this year .
ln six years , have we spent even one together ?
well , if you' re going to go ... then go .
the british amateur is the only major i haven' t won .
this may be my last chance .
mary , honey , i understand how you feel .
you do ?
you know how i feel ?
this time it' s gonna be different .
the usga is paying for everything .
i' m taking you with me .
do you think i' m worried about myself ?
i know what these tournaments do to you ...
i know how exhausted ... and tired and depressed and physically ill you get .
even when you win .
and when you lose ....
we' ve been through this ... over and over .
i can' t stand by and watch you kill yourself over a stupid trophy anymore .
don' t you have enough of them ?
how many is enough , bob ?
it' s one of your favorites .
puccini died before he finished it .
sometimes i wonder if its beauty was the very thing that killed him .
a slave girl loves a prince ... but he cannot return her love .
he must not know .
he knows .
very well .
but there' s an evil princess in the land ... and he must solve a riddle she invented .
then he' il be free of his desire for her .
she begs and pleads , the girl whose love is true ... but he sends her away .
i' ve been selfish .
no , you haven' t .
mary , sometimes i feel like i' m in a cage .
like a cage of championship .
first you' re expected to get into it ... and you' re expected to stay there .
i can win all four of them .
what ?
i can win all four majors .
bob .
mary ...
i can do it .
i can' t get away from this idea of predestination .
i have to do it .
and then i' m gonna give it up .
i will have done everything .
no one can say a word .
but i can' t do it without you .
will you talk to the papers ?
what do you think your chances are to win all four majors this year ?
lloyds of london have the odds of 1 20 to 1 against it .
no wonder .
no one could do that .
i' ve put 500 on him .
ladies and gentlemen ... you gaze upon the winner of the 1930 amateur championship .
said winner to be formally presented to you by myself ... at some juncture in this final round of match play .
mr. bobby jones ... versus a champion of the united kingdom ...
mr. roger wethered .
at your pleasure , gentlemen .
good luck .
thank you .
a three footer , and the american is our champion .
on my signal , begin playing , and we escort the winner to the clubhouse .
after six grueling and closely contested matches this week ...
bobby jones emerged victorious today after beating roger wethered five and four .
i told you not to worry .
his moon is in sagittarius .
he' s in a very powerful cycle .
with this victory , mr. jones raises the question ..
can he win the remaining major contests this season ?
can he win the impregnable quadrilateral ?
yes , of course he can .
get up , let' s pour something for him .
don' t you start drinking till i' m there to supervise .
yes , dear .
come along .
morning .
good morning , sir .
sorry , you can' t park here , sir .
do you know who i am ?
yes , sir .
then you know i' m the defending british open champion .
yes , sir .
and you also know that for some archaic reason ... professional golfers are not allowed to use the clubhouse facilities .
amateurs only .
yes , sir .
well , this automobile is my dressing room .
and this automobile is my wardrobe .
and these stay parked right here until the tournament is over .
you see , i' m here to beat bobby jones .
hey , fellows .
i' m here to beat bobby jones .
how are we doing ?
walter hagen shot a sixty eight .
you only have one round to catch him .
or him to sink to my level .
careful , o. b. you' ve got a big black thing on your head .
you' re gonna kill me with those 40 footers .
mr. ramsey , the putter please .
thank you .
your boy' s finished .
i recognize you .
you' re the british open champion .
mary gave me your stomach medication .
i guess there' il be another parade in new york .
and the pros will be gunning for you at lnterlachen .
you know , the longer i play this game ... the harder it gets .
smile .
it' s 1 10 in the shade .
thank goodness we don' t have to play in the shade .
hello , kid .
hello , walter .
how' s that swing ?
you remember our match in ' 26 ?
i seem to remember you beat the living hell out of me .
remember what the headlines said ?
i think i tried to avoid the papers for a time .
jones loses to hagen .
that' s what the papers said .
you were always the news .
always the news , kid .
win or lose .
but you know ... this is where it stops , don' t you ?
lf you pull off this grand slam thing ... then i am nothing but a footnote .
i can' t let that happen .
i know .
you know , it' s kind of hot out there .
you might want to roll your sleeves up .
i can' t .
who' s gonna be second , walter ?
tell me something , fellows .
why is it , whenever i fail to stop this amateur ... the rest of you curl up and die , too ?
all this damn part timer has to do is show up ... and the best pros in the business drop dead .
one of you better step up in the final round , you hear me ?
go to hell , hagen .
he' s the best there is , and you know it .
three in a row , one to go !
well done , sir .
set them up .
yes , sir .
get this thing off me .
so , jones , when are you gonna cash in ?
hagen' s pitching that hair tonic , which is why you never see him wear a hat .
they pay a man not to wear a hat , can you believe that ?
hair tonic , shaving cream .
all you' ve got to do ... is sign your name and make a million bucks .
so , what' s holding up your parade , sport ?
i' m an amateur , mr. mullen .
do you know what the origin of that word is ?
it' s from the latin root , " to love .
to be an amateur is to love the game .
once you play for money ... you can' t call it love anymore .
but i guess you' d know all about that .
so , what are you , jones , some kind of idiot ?
don' t think i don' t read your crap , keeler .
and that' s not the story we all want .
we want the one you' d print if you didn' t have your nose stuck so far
by golly , it' s fisticuffs .
bobby jones is a true amateur and a gentleman .
there' il never be another one like him .
money .
it' s gonna ruin sports .
colonel .
colonel ?
bob has got terrible stomach cramps .
i think it' s his appendix .
well , we' ve run every test we know .
and we all agree that the cramps are being caused by a nervous disorder .
and all i can do is prescribe paregoric .
i' m o. b. keeler , bringing you the first ever live radio broadcast ... of the u. s. amateur golf championship .
mr. bobby jones' s quest for the grand slam .
does the road wind uphill all the way yes , to the very end
will the journey take the whole day
from noon till night , my friend
... from the merion cricket club , where bobby jones has defeated jess sweetser ... in the semi finals of the u. s. amateur golf championship .
gene homans is now the one man who stands between ...
mr. jones and the grand slam .
good luck , son .
good luck .
bobby jones wins the hole .
he' s eight up with eight to play .
bobby jones to putt .
he lines it up .
now , the putt should break sharply to the left .
jones just misses left , leaving him a three footer .
mr. homans to putt .
he addresses the ball .
now , this putt should break right .
not even close .
mr. homans ... he' s conceding the hole and the match .
bobby jones has won the grand slam !
bobby jones has won the grand slam !
he won !
your dad won .
when do you turn pro ?
pardon me .
coming through .
where is he ?
congratulations , son .
thank you .
there are finer things than winning championships .
could i interest you in a marriage to a full time atlanta man ?
i think you' il like this fellow .
an obscure lawyer .
dots " i' s , " crosses " t' s " all day .
home for dinner by 5 : 30 .
it sounds like a dream .
it' s our dream .
i' m finished , mary .
i' m retiring from tournament golf .
you fulfill my heart , mary .
i love you .
i love you .
for when the one great scorer comes to write against your name
he writes not that you won or lost
but how you played the game
you won all these tournaments for your dad and for me ... and the people of atlanta .
you got two college degrees for your mother ... became a lawyer for your grandfather ... and you retired from golf for your wife .
what are you gonna do for yourself ?
we' re standing on the first tee .
i' m gonna call it augusta national .
it' s gonna be my homage to st. andrews .
welcome back to the course at st. andrews .
