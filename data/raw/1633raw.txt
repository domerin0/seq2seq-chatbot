locutus .
i am locutus of borg .
resistance is futile .
authorization picard four seven alpha tango .
admiral .
catched you in a bad time , jean luc ?
no , of course not .
i' ve just received a disturbing report from deep space five .
our colony on ivor prime was destroyed this morning .
long range sensors have picked up
i know .
the borg .
captain' s log , stardate 50893 . 5 .
the moment i' ve dreaded for nearly six years has arrived .
the borg , our most lethal enemy ... have begun an invasion of the federation ... and this time , there may be no stopping them .
how many ships ?
one , on a direct course for earth .
they' il cross the federation border in less than an hour .
admiral hayes is mobilizing a fleet in the typhon sector .
at maximum warp , it will take us 3 hours , 25 minutes
we' re not going .
what do you mean we' re not going ?
our orders are to patrol the neutral zone ... in case the romulans decide to take advantage of the situation .
the romulans ?
captain , there' s been no unusual activity ... along the romulan border for the last nine months .
it seems highly unlikely they' d choose this moment to start a conflict .
does starfleet feel we need more shakedown time ?
we' ve been in space nearly a year .
we' re ready .
the enterprise e is the most advanced starship in the fleet .
we should be on the front line .
i' ve gone over this with starfleet command .
their orders stand .
number one , set a course for the neutral zone .
bizet ?
berlioz .
what do you have ?
we finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone .
oh , fascinating .
twenty particles of space dust per cubic meter ... fifty two ultraviolet radiation spikes ... and a class il comet .
this is worthy of our attention .
why are we chasing comets ?
let' s just say starfleet has every confidence ... in the enterprise and her crew .
they' re not sure about her captain .
they believe a man who was captured ... and assimilated by the borg ... shouldn' t be put in a situation where he would face them again .
to do so would introduce an unstable element ... into a critical situation .
that' s ridiculous .
your experience makes you perfect to lead this fight .
admiral hayes disagrees .
bridge to captain picard .
go ahead .
we' ve received word from the fleet .
they' ve engaged the borg .
put starfleet frequency one four eight six on audio .
aye , sir .
flagship to endeavor .
stand by to engage at grid a 15 .
acknowledged .
we have it in visual range a borg cube on course zero mark two one five .
speed warp nine point
we are the borg .
lower your shields and surrender .
we will add your biological and technological distinctiveness ... to our own .
your culture will adapt to service us .
resistance is futile .
they' ve broken through the defense perimeter .
the cube is changing course .
zero two one mark four .
starfleet command , we need reinforcements .
ninety six dead , 22 wounded on the lexington !
this is commander luxi on the madison ...
lieutenant hawk , set a course for earth .
aye , sir .
maximum warp .
i' m about to commit a direct violation of orders .
any of you who wish to object should do so now .
it will be noted in my log .
i believe i speak for everyone when i say ...
to hell with our orders .
red alert .
all hands to battle stations .
engage .
report !
our weapons are gone .
perhaps today is a good day to die .
prepare for ramming speed !
sir , there' s another starship coming in .
it' s the enterprise .
the defiant' s losing life support .
transporter room , beam the defiant survivors aboard .
the admiral' s ship has been destroyed .
what' s the borg cube' s status ?
it has sustained heavy damage to its outer hull .
i am reading fluctuations in their power grid .
on screen .
number one , open a channel to the fleet .
channel open .
this is captain picard .
i' m taking command of the fleet .
target all your weapons onto the following coordinates .
fire at my command .
the coordinates you have indicated ... do not appear to be a vital system .
trust me , data .
the fleet' s responded .
they' re standing by .
fire .
mr. hawk , pursuit course .
engage .
aye , sir .
what ?
i hear them .
i have a patient who insists on coming to the bridge .
welcome aboard , mr. worf .
thank you , sir .
the defiant .
adrift , but salvageable .
tough little ship .
little ?
we could use help at tactical .
you do remember how to fire phasers ?
sensors show chronometric particles ... emanating from the sphere .
they' re creating a temporal vortex .
time travel .
data , report .
we' re caught in a temporal wake .
captain ... earth .
the atmosphere contains ... high concentrations of methane , carbon monoxide , and fluorine .
life signs ?
population approximately nine billion .
all borg .
how ?
they must' ve done it in the past .
they went back and assimilated earth , changed history .
lf they changed history , why are we still here ?
the temporal wake ... must have protected us from changes in the time line .
the vortex is collapsing .
hold your course , mr. hawk .
we must follow them back ... repair whatever damage they' ve done .
come on .
good night , eddy .
go home .
you' re gonna regret this tomorrow .
one thing you should have learned about me by now ... is i don' t have regrets .
come on , lily .
one more round .
z , you' ve had enough .
i' m not going up in that thing with a drunken pilot .
i sure as hell am not going up there sober .
what is that ?
that is the constellation leo .
no .
that .
it' s an econ !
after all these years ?
we gotta get to the phoenix .
to hell with the phoenix .
help !
move out !
this way !
run !
report .
shields are down .
long range sensors are off line .
main power' s holding .
according to our astrometric readings ... we are in the mid 21st century .
from the radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere ...
i estimate we have arrived 10 years after world war ill .
makes sense .
most of the major cities have been destroyed .
very few governments left .
600 million dead .
no resistance .
captain ...
mr. worf , quantum torpedoes .
ready , sir .
fire .
they were firing at the surface .
location ?
western hemisphere , north american continent .
looks like a missile complex in central montana .
missile complex ...
the date .
data , i need to know the exact date .
april 4 ... 2063 ?
april 4th the day before first contact .
precisely .
the missile complex must be where zefram cochran ... is building his warp ship .
that' s what they came to do stop first contact .
how much damage , lieutenant ?
can' t tell .
long range sensors are still off line .
we have to go down , find out what happened .
data , beverly , you' re with me .
have a security team meet us in transporter room three .
computer , mid 21st century civilian clothing .
number one , you have the bridge .
over here .
they' re all dead .
see if one of them is cochran .
data , let' s go check the warp ship .
the structural integrity of the missile appears intact ... but there is significant damage ... to various sections of the fuselage ... and primary intercooler system .
we have blueprints in the enterprise computer .
commander la forge will need to bring a team here
hold your fire !
we' re here to help !
bullshit !
captain , i believe i can handle this .
greetings .
captain , this woman requires medical attention .
severe theta radiation poisoning .
the radiation' s from the damaged throttle assembly .
we all have to be inoculated .
i have to get her to sick bay .
doctor ...
no lectures about the prime directive .
i' il keep her unconscious .
very well .
tell riker to beam down with a search party .
we need to find cochran .
crusher to enterprise two to beam directly to sick bay .
in less than 48 hours , this ship has to be launched .
picard to engineering .
la forge here .
geordi , cochran' s ship was damaged .
come with an engineering detail .
we have work to do .
i' m on my way .
alpha team , let' s assemble in transporter room three .
we' re heading to the surface .
porter , you' re in command till i get back .
and check out the environmental controls while i' m gone .
it' s getting warm in here .
let' s go .
isn' t it amazing ?
this ship used to be a nuclear missile .
it' s an historical irony that cochran would choose ... an instrument of destruction to inaugurate an era of peace .
it' s a boyhood fantasy .
i' ve seen this ship hundreds of times in the smithsonian ... but i was never able to touch it .
does tactile contact alter your perception of the phoenix ?
yes .
for humans , touch can connect you to an object ... in a very personal way , make it seem more real .
i am detecting imperfections in the titanium casing ... temperature variations in the fuel manifold .
it is no more real to me now than it was a moment ago .
would you three like to be alone ?
what have you found out ?
there' s no sign of cochran in the complex .
he has to be here .
there was nothing more important to him than this ship .
this flight was his dream .
we should consider the possibility ... that dr. cochran was killed in the attack .
lf that' s true ... the future may die with him .
what do you think ?
the environmental system' s gone crazy .
it' s not just engineering .
it' s the entire deck .
maybe it' s a problem with the e. p. s. conduits .
hello ?
hey !
are you talking to me ?
is anyone else working in this section ?
not that i know of .
aah !
paul ?
paul ?
are you ok in there ?
aah !
captain ?
what is it ?
picard to enterprise
mr. worf , is everything all right there ?
yes , sir .
we' re experiencing environmental difficulties on deck 16 ... but that is all .
what kind of difficulties ?
humidity levels have risen 73 % ... and the temperature has jumped 10 degrees in the last hour .
mr. data and i are returning to the ship .
number one , take charge down here .
aye , sir .
damage to her cell membranes is repaired .
she should be fine ... but i' d like to run another test on her spinal tissue .
and find out why it' s so hot in here .
now what ?
crusher to engineering .
crusher to bridge .
worf , i need to know exactly what' s been happening .
we just lost contact with deck 16 communications , internal sensors , everything .
i was about to send a security team to investigate .
no .
seal off deck 16 .
post security teams at every access point .
aye , sir .
before we lost internal sensors ... what were the exact conditions in main engineering ?
atmospheric pressure was 2 kilopasquals above normal ninety two percent humidity , 39 . 1 degrees celsius .
39 . 1 degrees celsius ...
like a borg ship .
they knew their ship was doomed .
our shields were down .
somehow they transported here without being detected .
they' il assimilate the enterprise , and then ...
earth .
picard to riker .
enterprise to away team .
respond .
main control is being rerouted ... through main engineering weapons , shields , propulsion .
quickly , mr. data , lock out the main computer .
i have isolated the main computer ... with a fractal encryption code .
it is unlikely the borg will be able to break it .
the borg have cut primary power to all decks except 16 .
the borg won' t stay on deck 16 .
wake up .
you' re all right .
come on .
wake up .
hmm !
stay calm .
you are all right .
you are gonna be fine .
i need you to do as i say .
alyssa , is the e. m. h. program still on line ?
it should be .
that' s a girl .
i swore i' d never use one of these .
computer , activate the e. m. h. program .
e. m. h. please state the nature of the medical emergency .
twenty borg are about to break through .
we need time to get out .
create a diversion .
this isn' t part of my program .
i' m a doctor , not a doorstop .
do a dance , tell a story .
i don' t care .
just give us a few seconds .
ahem .
according to starfleet medical research ...
borg implants can cause severe skin irritations .
perhaps you' d like an analgesic cream ?
which way ?
we need to get off this deck .
follow me .
first thing they' il do in engineering ... is establish a collective a central point from which they can control the hive .
if we fire particle weapons in engineering ... there' s a risk we may hit the warp core .
our goal should be to puncture one of the plasma coolant tanks .
data ?
excellent idea .
plasma coolant liquefies organic material on contact .
but the borg are not entirely organic .
true , but like all cybernetic life forms ... they cannot survive without their organic components .
i have ordered all weapons to be set ... on a rotating modulation .
the borg will adapt quickly .
we will be able to fire 12 shots at most .
one other thing
you may encounter enterprise crew members ... who have already been assimilated .
don' t hesitate to fire .
believe me , you' il be doing them a favor .
let' s go .
deanna ?
deanna !
deanna !
no , no !
don' t turn off that
who is this jerk ?
who told him he could turn off my music ?
will riker ...
zefram cochran .
he a friend of yours ?
yes .
husband ?
no .
good .
now , this , dina ...
deanna .
this ... is the good stuff .
dr. cochran  shh !
to the phoenix ... may she rest in peace .
ohh .
ok ... that wasn' t so good .
will , i think we have to tell him the truth .
but the time line  time line ? !
this is no time to argue about time !
we don' t have the time .
what was i saying ?
you' re drunk .
i am not .
yes , you are .
he wouldn' t talk to me unless i had a drink with him .
then it took three shots of something called tequila ... just to find out he was the one we' re looking for .
i' ve spent the last 20 minutes trying to keep his hands off me .
so don' t go criticizing my counseling technique .
sorry .
it' s a primitive culture .
i' m just trying to blend in .
you' re blended , all right .
i told our cover story .
he didn' t believe me .
we' re running out of time .
if we tell the truth , do you think he can handle it ?
lf you' re looking for my professional opinion ... as ship' s counselor ... he' s nuts .
i' il be sure to note that in my log .
captain , i believe i am feeling ... anxiety .
it is an intriguing sensation .
a most distracting
i' m sure it' s a fascinating experience ... but you should deactivate your emotion chip for now .
good idea , sir .
done .
data , there are times that i envy you .
it' s only me !
are you all right ?
yes , but we have wounded here .
lopez , get these people to deck 14 .
there was a civilian a woman from the 21st century .
we got separated .
we' il watch for her .
she has no idea what' s going on .
try to find her .
lower your weapons .
they' il ignore us till they consider us a threat .
the manual release .
mr. worf , hold this position .
manual release is on line .
perhaps we should just knock .
data .
ready phasers !
data , cover me .
captain , they' ve adapted !
aah !
regroup on deck 15 .
don' t let them touch you !
captain !
data !
uhh !
here !
help .
please , help .
aah !
you !
how did you  back off !
calm down !
shut up !
who are you ?
jean luc picard
no !
who are you with ? !
what faction ?
i' m not a member of the eastern coalition .
shut up !
i don' t care who you' re with .
get me out of here .
now !
that isn' t going to be easy .
find a way , soldier , or i' il push buttons .
all right !
follow me .
slow !
your efforts to break the encryption codes ... will not be successful ... nor will your attempts to assimilate me ... into your collective .
brave words .
i' ve heard them before ... from thousands of species across thousands of worlds ... since long before you were created .
but now , they are all borg .
i am unlike any life form you have encountered .
the codes in my neural net cannot be forcibly removed .
you are an imperfect being created by an imperfect being .
finding your weakness is only a matter of time .
let me make sure i understand you , commander .
a group of cybernetic creatures from the future ... have traveled back through time to enslave the human race ... and you' re here to stop them ?
that' s right .
hot damn .
you' re heroic .
we' re gonna prove it to you .
geordi ?
there she is .
beautiful !
all right , take a look .
well , well , well .
what we got here ?
i love a good peep show .
that' s a trick .
how' d you do that ?
it' s your telescope .
that' s our ship , the enterprise .
and lily' s up there now ?
that' s right .
can i talk to her ?
we' ve lost contact .
we don' t know why yet .
what is it you want me to do ?
simple .
conduct your warp flight tomorrow morning as you planned .
why tomorrow morning ?
because at 11 : 00 ... an alien ship will begin passing through this solar system .
alien .
you mean extraterrestrials ?
more bad guys ?
good guys .
they' re on a survey mission .
they have no interest in earth .
too primitive .
oh .
when they detect your ship' s warp signature ... and realize humans can now travel faster than light ... they decide to alter their course ... and make first contact with earth right here .
here ?
actually , over there .
it is a pivotal moment in human history .
you make first contact with an alien race ... and after you do , everything begins to change .
your theories on warp drive ... allow fleets of starships to be built ... and mankind to start exploring the galaxy .
it unites humanity in a way no one thought possible ... when they realize they' re not alone in the universe .
poverty , disease , war they' il all be gone in 50 years .
but unless you make that warp flight tomorrow morning ... before 11 : 15 , none of it will happen .
and you people , you' re all astronauts ... on some kind of star trek .
i know this is a lot for you to take in ... but we' re running out of time .
we need your help .
what do you say ?
why not ?
it' s pretty bad , sir .
it looks like they control decks 26 up to 11 .
but when they took deck 11 , they just stopped .
the borg have assimilated more than half the ship ... in a matter of hours .
why stop there ?
what is on deck 11 ?
hydroponics , stellar cartography ... deflector control .
no vital system .
they wouldn' t stop unless it gave a tactical advantage .
return to your checkpoint .
send reports every 10 minutes .
something must' ve happened in sick bay .
where are dr. crusher and the others ?
why did you break the cease fire ?
we didn' t attack you .
who did ?
there' s a new faction ... that wants to prevent your launch tomorrow morning ... but we' re here to help you .
this may be difficult for you to accept ... but you are not in montana anymore .
you' re on a ship a spaceship orbiting the earth at an altitude
you wanna help me , get me outta here .
all right .
you want a way out , here it is .
what is this ?
australia ...
new guinea , the solomons .
montana will be up soon .
but you may want to hold your breath .
it' s a long way down .
now , listen to me , i' m not your enemy ... and i can get you home .
but first you must put that weapon down and trust me .
jean luc picard .
my name .
that' s my name .
what' s yours ?
lily .
welcome aboard , lily .
thank you .
maximum setting .
if you' d fired this , you would' ve vaporized me .
it' s my first ray gun .
there' s no glass .
aah !
force field .
i' ve never seen that kind of technology .
that' s because it hasn' t been invented yet .
what ?
there' s more i have to tell you .
come on .
are you ready ?
who are you ?
i am the borg .
that is a contradiction .
the borg have a collective consciousness .
there are no individuals .
i am the beginning ... the end ... the one who is many .
i am the borg .
greetings .
i am curious .
do you control the borg collective ?
you imply a disparity where none exists .
i am the collective .
perhaps i should rephrase the question .
i wish to understand ... the organizational relationships .
are you their leader ?
i bring order to chaos .
an interesting , if cryptic response .
you are in chaos , data .
you are the contradiction .
a machine who wishes to be human .
since you seem to know so much about me ... you must be aware that i am programmed to evolve ... to better myself .
we , too , are on a quest to better ourselves .
evolving toward a state of perfection .
forgive me , but the borg do not evolve , they conquer .
by assimilating other beings into our collective ... we are bringing them closer to perfection .
somehow i question your motives .
that is because you haven' t been properly ... stimulated yet .
you have reactivated my emotion chip .
why ?
don' t be frightened .
i am not frightened .
do you know what this is , data ?
it would appear you are attempting ... to graft organic skin onto my endo skeletal structure .
what a cold description for such a beautiful gift .
was that good for you ?
ooh .
how many planets are in this federation ?
over 150 spread across 8, 000 light years .
you must not get home much .
actually , i tend to think of this ship as home .
but if it' s earth you' re talking about ...
i try to get back whenever i can .
good .
they haven' t broken the encryption code yet .
who , those bionic zombies you told me about ?
the
borg .
borg ?
sounds swedish .
how big is this ship ?
there are 24 decks .
almost 700 meters long .
it took me six months to scrounge enough titanium ... to build a four meter cockpit .
how much did this thing cost ?
the economics of the future are different .
you see , money doesn' t exist in the 24th century .
no money ?
you mean you don' t get paid ?
the acquisition of wealth is no longer ... the driving force in our lives .
we work to better ourselves ... and the rest of humanity .
actually , we' re rather like yourself and dr. cochran .
aah !
all right !
all right .
come on .
is there another way around ?
i know what i' m doing .
definitely not swedish .
aah !
aah !
what the hell are you doing ?
perhaps something in satin ?
and you do understand we have a strict dress code ... so if you boys don' t leave right now , i' il
i' m looking for nicky the nose .
the nose ?
he hasn' t been here in months .
this is the wrong chapter .
computer , begin chapter 13 .
lf i say i love you ...
try to look as if you' re having a good time .
i want you to know ... it' s not just because there' s moonlight ... although ...
no .
look at me .
try to act naturally .
there he is .
you' re all dressed up ... to go dreamin ' .
now , don' t tell me , i know ...
mmm .
ruby .
this is not a good time .
it' s never the time for us , is it , dix ?
always some excuse , some case you' re working on .
i have talk to nicky .
i' il see you later .
watch your caboose and dump the broad .
lf i say ...
i love you ...
i want you to know ...
well , well , well , look what the cat dragged in .
what' s shakin ' , dix ?
the usual , martinis and skirts .
excuse me .
whaa !
no offense .
ooh !
aah !
yaaaah !
aah !
hey !
i think you got him .
i don' t get it .
i thought you said this was all a bunch of holograms .
i disengaged the safety protocols .
without them , even a holographic bullet can kill .
what are you doing ?
i' m looking for the neuro processor .
every borg has one .
it' s like a memory chip .
it will contain a record of all the instructions ... this borg has been receiving from the collective .
oh , my .
jean luc , it' s one of your uniforms .
yes .
this was ensign lynch .
tough luck , huh ?
i' ve got to get to the bridge .
go on .
jeez .
ffft .
doctor ?
yeah ?
would you mind taking a look at this ?
uh , ahem , yeah .
ahem .
i tried to reconstruct the intermix chamber ... from what i remember in school .
tell me if i got it right .
you learned about this in school ?
basic warp design is required at the academy .
the first chapter is called " zefram cochran .
well , looks like you got it right .
commander , this is what we' re thinking of using ... to replace the damaged warp plasma conduit .
yeah , reg , that' s good , but you need ... to reinforce this copper tubing with a nano polymer .
dr. cochran , i know this sounds silly ... but can i shake your hand ?
oh , thank you , doctor .
i can' t tell you what an honor it is to work with you .
i never imagined i' d meet the inventor of warp drive
reg !
i' m sorry .
right .
thanks .
do they have to keep doing that ?
it' s just a little hero worship .
to tell you the truth , i can' t say i blame them .
we all grew up hearing about what you did here ... or what you' re about to do .
i probably shouldn' t even tell you this ... but i went to zefram cochran high school .
really ?
you know , i wish i had a picture of this .
what ?
well , you see , in the future ... this whole area becomes an historical monument .
you' re standing almost on the exact spot ... where your statue' s gonna be .
statue ?
oh , yeah .
it' s marble , about 20 meters tall ... and you' re looking up at the sky ... and your hand' s sort of reaching toward the future .
i gotta take a leak .
leak ?
i' m not detecting any leak .
don' t you people from the 24th century ever pee ?
oh .
leak .
i get it .
that' s pretty funny .
excuse me .
commander ?
captain .
jean luc .
reports of my assimilation are greatly exaggerated .
i found something you lost .
i am a klingon .
mr. worf , report .
the borg control over half the ship .
we have tried to restore power ... to the bridge and weapons systems ... but we have been unsuccessful .
we have another problem .
i' ve accessed a borg neuro processor ... and i' ve discovered what they' re trying to do .
they' re transforming the deflector dish ... into an interplexing beacon .
interplexing ?
it' s a sub space transmitter .
if they activate the beacon , they' il establish a link ... with the borg living in this century .
but in the 21st century ... the borg are still in the delta quadrant .
reinforcements .
humanity will be an easy target .
attack the earth in the past to assimilate the future .
then we must destroy the deflector dish ... before they can activate the beacon .
we can' t get to deflector control or a shuttlecraft
mr. worf , do you remember your zero g combat training ?
i remember it made me sick to my stomach .
what are you suggesting ?
i think it' s time that we took a little stroll .
hang on .
there' s a humanoid life sign up ahead .
511 meters .
cochran ?
mm hmm .
it' s him all right .
i have remodulated the pulse emitters ... but i do not believe we will get more ... than one or two shots before the borg adapt .
then we must make every shot count .
magnetize .
watch your caboose , dix .
i intend to .
how are you doing , mr. worf ?
not well , sir .
try not to look at the stars .
keep your eyes on the hull .
let' s go .
tell me , are you using a polymer based neuro relay ... to transit the organic nerve impulses ... to the central processor of my positronic net ?
if that is the case , how have you solved ... the problem of increased signal degradation ... inherent to organo synthetic transmission
do you always talk this much ?
not always ... but often .
why do you utilize this primitive communication ?
your android brain is capable of so much more .
have you forgotten ?
i am endeavoring to become more human .
human .
we used to be exactly like them flawed , weak , organic .
but we evolved to include the synthetic .
now we use both to attain perfection .
your goal should be the same as ours .
believing oneself to be perfect ... is often the sign of a delusional mind .
small words from a small being ... trying to attack what he doesn' t understand .
i understand that you have no real interest in me ... that your goal is to obtain the encryption codes ... for the enterprise computer .
that is one of our goals ... one of many ... but in order to reach it ...
i' m willing to help you reach yours .
aah !
is it becoming clear to you yet ?
look at yourself standing there ... cradling the new flesh that i' ve given you .
if it means nothing to you , why protect it ?
i ... am simply imitating the behavior of humans .
you' re becoming more human all the time , data .
now you' re learning how to lie .
my programming was not designed to process these sensations .
then tear the skin from your limb ... as you would a defective circuit .
go ahead , data .
we won' t stop you .
do it .
don' t be tempted by flesh .
are you familiar with physical forms of pleasure ?
if you are ... referring to ... sexuality ...
i am fully functional ... programmed in multiple techniques .
how long has it been since you' ve used them ?
eight years ... seven months , sixteen days , four minutes
far too long .
we should bring reinforcements .
there' s no time .
it looks as if they' re building the beacon ... right on top of the particle emitter .
once all the transponder rods are in place ... the beacon will be activated .
lf we set our phasers to full power
no .
there' s a risk that we hit the dish .
it' s charged with anti protons .
we could destroy half the ship .
we have to find another way .
doctor ?
sir ?
you still looking for the bathroom ?
i' m not going back .
look , doc , we can' t do this without you .
i don' t care .
i don' t want to be a statue .
doctor  you stay away from me .
we don' t have time for this .
unh !
you told him about the statue ?
for this to work ... all three maglocks will have to be released .
magnetic constrictors are disengaged .
they' ve adapted .
warning .
decompression in 45 seconds .
hawk !
aah !
we' ve had a change of plans , data .
assimilate this .
only got an hour to go , doc .
how you feeling ?
i got a four alarm hangover ... either from the whiskey or your laser beam ... or both ... but i' m ready to make history .
ha ha ha !
troi to commander riker .
riker here .
we' re ready to open the launch door .
go ahead .
oh .
look at that .
you don' t have a moon in the 24th century ?
sure we do .
just looks a lot different .
there are 50 million people living on the moon in my time .
you can see tycho city , new berlin ... even lake armstrong on a day like this .
uh huh .
and you know , doctor
please !
don' t tell me it' s all thanks to me .
i' ve heard enough about the great zefram cochran .
i don' t know who writes your history books ... or where you get your information from ... but you people got some pretty funny ideas about me .
you all look at me as if i' m some kind of ... saint or visionary or something .
i don' t think you' re a saint , doc ... but you did have a vision , and now we' re sitting in it .
you want to know what my vision is ?
dollar signs .
money .
i didn' t build this ship to usher in a new era for humanity .
you think i want to go to the stars ?
i don' t even like to fly .
i take trains .
i built this so i could retire to some tropical island ... filled with ... naked women .
that' s zefram cochran .
that' s his vision .
this other guy you keep talking about ... this historical figure ?
i never met him .
i can' t imagine i ever will .
someone once said , " don' t try to be a great man .
just be a man and let history make its own judgments .
that' s rhetorical nonsense .
who said that ?
you did .
10 years from now .
you got 58 minutes , doc .
you better get on that checklist .
they' re on the move again .
the borg just overran three of our defense checkpoints .
they' ve taken over decks five and six .
they' ve adapted to every modulation of our weapons .
we have to work on finding another way ... to modify our weapons so they' il be more effective .
in the meantime , tell your men to stand their ground .
sir
fight hand to hand if they have to .
aye , sir .
wait .
captain , our weapons are useless .
we must activate the auto destruct sequence ... and use the escape pods to evacuate the ship .
no !
lf we destroy the ship , we destroy the borg .
we' re going to stay and fight .
sir , we have lost the enterprise .
we should not sacrifice
we have not lost the enterprise .
we are not going to lose her , not while i' m in command .
you have your orders .
i must object to this course of action
objection noted .
with all due respect , sir , i believe you are allowing ... your personal experience to influence your judgment .
you' re afraid .
you want to destroy the ship and run away .
you coward .
jean luc !
if you were any other man , i would kill you where you stand .
get off my bridge .
what do we do now ?
we carry out his orders .
dyson , kaplan , start working on a way to modify the weapons
this is stupid .
if we can get off this ship and then blow it up , do it .
once the captain' s made up his mind , the discussion' s over .
lily !
you son of a bitch .
this really isn' t the time .
ok .
i don' t know jack about the 24th century ... but everybody out there thinks that staying here ... and fighting the borg is suicide .
they' re just afraid to come in here and say it .
the crew is accustomed to following my orders .
they' re probably accustomed to your orders making sense .
none of them understand the borg as i do !
no one does .
no one can .
what is that supposed to mean ?
six years ago ... they assimilated me into their collective .
they had cybernetic devices implanted throughout my body .
i was linked to the hive mind ... every trace of individuality erased .
i was one of them .
so you can imagine , my dear ...
i have a somewhat unique perspective on the borg ... and i know how to fight them .
now , if you will excuse me , i have work to do .
i am such an idiot .
it' s so simple .
the borg hurt you ... and now you' re going to hurt them back .
in my century , we don' t succumb to revenge .
we have a more evolved sensibility .
bullshit !
i saw the look on your face ... when you shot those borg on the holodeck .
you were almost enjoying it .
how dare you ?
come on , captain .
you' re not the first man ... to get a thrill from murdering someone .
i see it all the time .
get out !
or what ?
you' il kill me like you killed ensign lynch ?
there was no way to save him .
you didn' t even try !
where was your evolved sensibility then ?
i don' t have time for this .
oh , hey , i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to interrupt your little quest .
captain ahab has to go hunt his whale .
what ?
you do have books in the 24th century ?
this is not about revenge .
liar !
this is about saving the future of humanity !
jean luc , blow up the damn ship !
no !
no !
i will not sacrifice the enterprise .
we' ve made too many compromises , too many retreats .
they invade our space , and we fall back .
they assimilate entire worlds , and we fall back .
not again .
the line must be drawn here !
this far , no farther !
and i will make them pay for what they' ve done !
you broke your little ships .
see you around , ahab .
and he piled upon the whale' s white hump ...
the sum of all the rage and hate ...
felt by his whole race .
if his chest had been a cannon ...
he would have shot his heart upon it .
what ?
moby dick .
actually , i never read it .
ahab spent years ... hunting the white whale that crippled him .
quest for vengeance .
but in the end ... it destroyed him and his ship .
i guess he didn' t know when to quit .
prepare to evacuate the enterprise .
a. t. r. setting ?
active .
main bus ?

initiate pre ignition sequence .
begin auto destruct sequence ... authorization picard four seven alpha tango .

awaiting final code to begin auto destruct sequence .
this is captain jean luc picard .

enable .
self destruct in 15 minutes .
there will be no further audio warnings .
so much for the enterprise e.
we barely knew her .
you think they' il build another one ?
plenty of letters left in the alphabet .
mr. worf .
i regret some of the things i said to you earlier .
some ?
as a matter of fact ...
i think you' re the bravest man i have ever known .
thank you , sir .
see you on gravett island .
captain .
data .
control to phoenix .
final launch sequence checks are complete .
good luck .
everybody ready to make some history ?
always am .
i think i forgot something .
what ?
i don' t know .
it' s probably nothing .
begin ignition sequence .
oh , god !
now i remember .
what ?
where is it ?
we can' t lift off without it .
geordi , we' ve got to abort .
no !
no , wait !
i found it .
twelve , eleven ... ten ... nine ... eight ...
let' s rock ' n ' roll !
you don' t know what ... we can find .
why don' t you come with me , little girl ... on a magic carpet ride ?
you don' t know what ... we can see .
why don' t you tell your dreams to me ?
could you turn that down a little ?
close your eyes
we' ve got a red light on the second intake valve .
ignore it .
we' il be fine .
prepare first stage shutdown and separation on my mark .
three ... two ... one ... mark .
ok , let' s bring the warp core on line .
oh , wow .
you ain' t seen nothin ' yet .
lf you see any of my crew , give them this .
what is it ?
orders to find a quiet corner of north america ... and stay out of history' s way .
well , good luck .
to both of us .
you' re not leaving , are you ?
lily , when i was held captive on the borg ship ... my crew risked everything to save me .
there is ... someone still on this ship ... and i owe him the same .
go and find your friend .
what' s wrong , locutus ?
isn' t this familiar ?
organic minds are such fragile things .
how could you forget me so quickly ?
we were very close , you and l .
you can still hear our song .
yes , i ...
i remember you .
you were there all the time .
but that ship ... and all the borg on it were destroyed .
you think in such three dimensional terms .
how small you' ve become .
data understands me .
don' t you , data ?
what have you done to him ?
given him what he always wanted flesh and blood .
let him go .
he' s not the one you want .
are you offering yourself to us ?
offering myself ?
that' s it .
i remember now .
it wasn' t enough that you assimilate me .
i had to give myself freely to the borg .
to you .
you flatter yourself .
i' ve overseen the assimilation of countless millions .
you were no different .
you' re lying .
you wanted more than just another borg drone .
you wanted a human being with a mind of his own ... who could bridge the gulf between humanity and the borg .
you wanted a counterpart , but i resisted .
i fought you .
you can' t begin to imagine the life you denied yourself .
it' s not too late .
locutus could still be with you ... just in the way you wanted an equal .
let data go ... and i will take my place at your side ... willingly without any resistance .
such a noble creature ... a quality we sometimes lack .
we will add your distinctiveness to our own .
welcome home ... locutus .
data , you are free to go .
data , go .
no .
i do not wish to go .
as you can see , i have already found an equal .
data , deactivate the self destruct sequence .
data , no .
don' t do it .
data , listen to me .
auto destruct sequence deactivated .
now , enter the encryption codes and give me computer control .
data !
data ...
he will make an excellent drone .
plasma injectors are on line .
everything' s looking good .
i think we' re ready .
they should be out there right now .
we better break the warp barrier in the next five minutes ... if we' re gonna get their attention .
nacelles are charged and ready .
let' s do it !
engage .
warp field is looking good .
structural integrity is holding .
speed 20, 000 kilometers per second .
sweet jesus !
relax , doctor .
i' m sure they' re just here to give us a sendoff .
i am bringing the external sensors on line .
30 seconds to warp threshold .
approaching light speed .
we' re at critical velocity .
quantum torpedoes locked .
destroy them .
watch your future' s end .
data !
resistance is futile .
aah !
whoa !
aah !
aah !
that should be enough .
throttle back .
take us out of warp .
is that earth ?
that' s it .
it' s so small .
it' s about to get a whole lot bigger .
captain .
data .
are you all right ?
i would imagine i look worse than l
feel .
strange .
part of me is sorry she is dead .
she was unique .
she brought me closer to humanity ... than i ever thought possible ... and for a time ...
i was tempted by her offer .
how long a time ?
zero point six eight seconds , sir .
for an android , that is nearly an eternity .
captain' s log , april 5 , 2063 .
captain' s log , april 5 , 2063 .
the voyage of the phoenix was a success ... again .
the alien ship detected the warp signature ... and is on its way to rendezvous with history .
my god ... they' re really from another world .
and they' il want to meet the man who flew that warp ship .
live long and prosper .
thanks .
i think it' s time we made a discreet exit .
riker to enterprise , stand by to beam us up .
you gotta go ?
i envy you ... the world you' re going to .
i envy you ... taking these first steps into a new frontier .
i shall miss you , lily .
picard to enterprise , energize .
report .
the moon' s gravitational field ... obscured our warp signature .
the vulcans did not detect us .
i' ve reconfigured our warp field ... to match the chronometric readings of the borg sphere .
recreate the vortex , commander .
all decks report ready .
helm standing by .
mr. data , lay in a course for the 24th century .
i suspect our future is there waiting for us .
course laid in , sir .
make it so .
no , no .
it' s music .
i' il play you some .
ooby dooby ...
no , no ...
ooby dooby ...
you dance to it .
ooby dooby dooby dooby ...
dooby dooby doo wah doo wah doo wah ...
well , you wiggle to the left ...
you wiggle to the right ...
do the ooby dooby with all your might ...
ooby dooby ...
