the commander and jetstream .
his super strength makes him pretty much indestructible .
she has the power of supersonic flight along with a total mastery of unarmed combat .
by day , they live as steve and josie stronghold , the top real estate agents in the metropolis of maxville .
but whenever duty calls , they are the commander and jetstream .
mom and dad .
that' s me in the middle .
you look at them and see the defenders of the world .
all i see is my dad wearing tights .
don' t get me wrong .
it can be cool to have superhero parents ,
like when mom picks up awesome takeout on her way home from work .
on the other hand , living up to the family name means that i' m supposed to save the world someday .
here we go .
i just have one small problem .
everybody wants to rule the world ]
come on .
come on .
exactly what we want to hear .
well , that was bert timmerman and he is buying the colonial on pine terrace .
above asking .
no contingencies .
honey , i know that selling real estate is just our cover , but i think we' re in line to win that sales trip to hawaii .
we haven' t been to hawaii since king kamehamayhem set off that volcano .
you , me on the beach , no exploding volcanoes .
mmm , i can feel the sand in my toes already .
will is gonna be down any minute .
hey , it' s his first day of school .
where is he ?
will ?
will ?
oh !
ah !
come on , buddy .
let' s get moving !
two hundred !
oh , hey , dad .
just trying to get a few sets in before school .
low weights , high rep , huh ?
good thinking .
don' t want to bulk up .
nah , going more for definition .
big day , huh ?
will ?
i just want you to know how proud i am that you' il be attending my alma mater and someday following me into the family business .
real estate ?
right .
real estate .
on a more serious note , son ,
i know that every kid thinks his dad' s invincible and i nearly am , but who knows ?
maybe the next time i punch a meteor hurtling toward earth ,
i' il be the one who shatters into a million pieces .
i i guess all i' m trying to say here , will , is it' s nice to know that whatever happens to me , you' il still be around to save the world .
looking forward to it .
we all are .
oh !
hey !
oof !
good morning , mrs. stronghold .

josie stronghold .

if you' re traveling eastbound on the 115 , you might think about alternate routes .
hang on .
this just in .
the commander and jetstream are on their way .

son of the commander and jetstream !

the seat behind ron wilson belongs to will stronghold .
it would be an honor .
it' s fine .
you don' t have to .
no , i want to .
you' re third generation , man .
magenta , get up .

he only needs one seat .
so he can sit with his girlfriend .

freshmen .

sky high .
kept aloft by the latest in antigravitational propulsion .
she is in constant motion as a precaution against those who otherwise might have nefarious plans , her location supplied only to a few highly qualified individuals such as myself , ron wilson , bus driver .
smooth and easy .
whoa !
sorry !
word of advice .
don' t miss the bus , ' cause the bus waits for no one .
except for you , will stronghold !
you ever running late , running early , or you just want to talk ... ... give me a call .
thanks , ron .
seriously .
can' t stop the world ]
yeah !
freeze girl !
hello , freshmen , don' t be shy
welcome newbies to sky high !
juniors , seniors , all the rest
we' re back to school sky is the best !
ready , one , two , three .
whoo !
we' re number one !
sky high !
we' re ...
i hate that cheer .
speed , round ' em up , ok ?
hey , freshmen !
your attention , please .
i' m lash .
uh , this is speed .
as representatives of the sky high welcoming committee ...
we' d be happy to collect that $15 new student fee .
um , there was nothing about a new student fee in the handbook .
ok , guys .
very funny .
i' il take over from here .
hey , everybody .
i' m gwen grayson , your student body president .
i know you' re all going to love it here at sky high .
i know i have .
i' ve just had the greatest experience ...
true ]
... but there are a few rules that i just want to let you guys know .
first of all ...
if you can remember those few simple rules ,
i promise you will not fall off the edge of the school .
follow me inside for orientation .
rules ?
what rules ?
werert you paying attention ?
good morning .
i am principal powers .
on behalf of all the faculty and staff , welcome to sky high .
yeah !
in a few moments you will go through power placement and your own heroic journey will begin .
" power placement " ?
sounds fascist .
it' s how they decide where you go .
the hero track or the loser track .
th th there' s a loser track ?
i believe the preferred term is " hero support .
for now , good deeds and good luck .
let the adventure begin .
comets away !
all right , listen up .
my name is coach boomer .
you may know me as " sonic boom .
you may not .
here' s how power placement is gonna work .
you will step up here and show me your power .
and , yes , you will do so in front of the entire class .
i will then determine where you will be assigned .
hero or sidekick .
now , every year there are a few students or , as i like to call them , " whiner babies , " who see fit to question and to complain about their placement .
so let' s get one thing straight .
my word is law .
my judgment is final , so there will be no whiner babies .
are we clear ?
i said , are we ... [ roaring ] clear ? !
yes , coach boomer !
go time !
you !
what' s your name ?
l l larry .
little larry .
get up here .
what' s humiliating him going to prove ?
this is so unfair .
if life were to suddenly get fair ,
i doubt it would happen in high school .
car !
big larry .
hero !
so he' s good .
but i' m better .
did i say you were next ?
name' s zach , coach boomer .
try not to drop your clipboard .
any day now , superstar .
i' m doir it .
doir what ?
i' m glowir .
i don' t think so .
well , it' s easier to see in a dark room .
turn off these lights , cup your hands around your eyes and look real close ...
sidekick !
are you sure you don' t want to just ... [ roaring ]
sidekick !
you !
front and center !
let me start off by saying
what an honor it is to ...
is that your power ?
butt kissery ?
very funny , sir .
i' ve heard you had a wicked sense of ...
shut up and power up .
right away , sir .
say , that' s pretty impressive ... ... for a popsicle !
sidekick !
hero !
side ... kick !
super spit ?
sidekick .
acid spit .
hero !
ho !
hero !
and a handsome one at that .
get out of here , knucklehead !
purple kid .
let' s go .
what' s your shtick ?
i' m a shape shifter .
ok .
shift it .
a guinea pig ?
yep .
not even a swarm of guinea pigs ?
uh , no .
sidekick .
shoo !
bite me .
you .
flower child .
let' s go .
uh , i believe in only using my powers when the situation demands it .
well , you' re in luck .
this is the situation , and i' m demanding it .
but to participate in this test would be to support a flawed system .
the whole hero sidekick dichotomy only serves to ...
let me get this straight .
are you refusing to show your powers ?
it' s more complicated .
sidekick !
we' il pick it up right after lunch , starting with you .
that' s not cool .
i tell you , boomer will regret making me a sidekick .
i tell you , boomer will regret making me a sidekick .
all right ?
someday it' il be dark , he' il be all alone , walking to his car .
he' il drop his keys , and i won' t glow to help him find ' em .
you got a problem with me ?
uh , no .
no what ?
no , sir .
no , sir !
no , sir !
just messir with you , sidekick .
you' re not supposed to use your powers outside of the school gym !
the cafeteria staff requests sidekicks stop ordering hero sandwiches .
am i crazy , or is that guy really looking at me ?
dude .
what ?
that' s warren peace .
that' s warren peace ?
yeah .
i' ve heard about him .
his mom' s a hero and his dad' s a supervillain .
baron battle .
where do i come in ?
your dad busted his dad .
quadruple life sentence .
no parole until after his third life .
that' s great .
my first day of sky high , and i already have an archenemy .
hmm .
is he still lookir ?
no .
no ?
no .
i thought you said he wasrt looking .
there is no smoking on school grounds , or freezing or bursting into flame .
i' m ...
will stronghold .
aha !
mind reader !
no .
name tag .
right .
uh ...
uh , these are my friends .
that' s zach .
what' s up ?
and ...
layla .
got it .
i' m gwen .
hi .
i love your skirt .
th thanks .
how' s power placement going ?
um ... great .
i' m not surprised .
i need a freshman rep for the homecoming committee ...
true ]
... we could talk about it over lunch .
i eat lunch .
how cute is he ?
i guess i' il see you guys around .
yeah .
bye .
bye .
i don' t think she really liked my skirt .
see you .
and thanks for the swirly .
what' s up , guys ?
the kid , uh ,
looked a little dehydrated .
how about it , stronghold ?
you gonna hang with us this year ?
help us bring some pain to the sidekicks ?
that sounds like ... fun .
hmm .
good man .
see you around .
ok .
what do you mean , you don' t know what your power is ?
well , uh ...
i got it .
you' re messir with the coach .
just like your old man !
car !
wow !
that was close !
are you insane ? !
i don' t have super strength !
oh , i get it .
you' re a flier , just like your ma .
why didn' t you say so ?
whoa !
quit messir around .
i haven' t got all day .
what' s your power ?
i don' t have one .
stronghold .
siiiide ... ... kick !
hmm .
i remember doing this to your father when he was just your age .
kicked me through that wall !
you , uh , haven' t called him yet , have you ?
like i want to be the one to tell the commander his son has no powers ?
ooh !
let' s ...
let' s take a look at that chest .
well , nothing seems to be broken .
except for me not having my powers .
well , maybe you' re just a late bloomer .
you could get one of them or both .
your mother' s flying or your father' s super strength .
but when ?
the kids who get bit by , uh , radioactive insects or fall into a vat of toxic waste , their powers usually show up the next day .
or ... they die .
ooh , lookit .
but kids who inerit their powers ... ... well , impossible to say .
but i will get them , right ?
many sidekicks are the offspring of one super parent , mmm , and one ordinary parent .
hmm !
but there are cases , rare , yet not uneard of , where the child of two super powered parents , mmm mmm , never acquires any ... powers whatsoever .
there are ?
like who ?
well , i know of only one .
ron wilson , bus driver ?
there he is .
there he is now .
a three and a half bath victorian with original crown molding ?
you bet we' d love to take a look .
how' s , uh ...
when do we brief the president on supervillain infiltration of the irs ?
president would be monday .
tuesday ?
great .
no , thank you , linda .
hon , dinner' s almost ready .
could you stop playing with your robot eye
and help set the table ?
sure .
oh , there he is !
hey .
man of the hour !
well , how' d it go ?
um , dad , we need to talk .
you mean a little hero to hero talk ?
i think i know just the place .
come on .
hon ?
ok , so , dad ...
oh , this isn' t the place , will .
this ...
... is the place .
no way !
the secret sanctum ?
you know , i' il never forget my first day at sky high .
your grandfather finally trusted me enough to give me the key to his secret sanctum .
' course , in those days , we still used keys .
go ahead , son .
i already added your biometrics this morning .
oh , will , one thing .
' course , you must never ever bring anyone into the secret sanctum .
that' s why it' s called the secret ... sanctum .
uh , i would never .
go for it .
oh , this one' s mine , will .
you can use mom' s .
sorry .
no way .
you' ve got a pool table ?
how about the pinball machine ?
man .
let' s see .
where do i start ?
uh , i don' t know .
over here we got mom' s stuff .
uh , scientific equipment , gadgetry , whatnot .
will ?
oh .
yeah .
all our greatest battles .
our finest moments .
ticranium' s head .
exo' s number one bug bot .
and is this , uh ... ?
royal pairs pacifier .
now that was a great day , will .
the first time your mom and i ever teamed up to fight evildoers .
soon as she came smashing through the window , i knew she was the one for me .
i wish you could have seen us .
we were fantastic !
royal pain got his , and i got the pacifier .
and this is my proudest possession .
oh .
well , it' s amazing .
well .
what' s it do ?
no idea .
so this is it .
it' s all down here .
our story , your mom and me , of , well , kickir butt and takir names , huh ?
but now it' s time for a new chapter in the story .
the three of us , fighting crime together side by side ... by side .
now , what was it you wanted to tell me about ?
oh , um ... ... that i' m gonna kick your butt at pool !
well , we' il see about that !
ok .
choose your weapon , sir .
i' il break .
there it is .
you got the right one .
you were right .
he took it home .
hey , he' s got the ego the size of a giant robot .
uncle !
uncle !
uncle !
please , please let me get what i want ]
hey , layla .
hi .
so where were you after school ?
i was worried .
i got stuck in the nurse' s office .
and the news just keeps getting better and better .
turns out i may never get my powers .
how' d your dad take it ?
what was i supposed to do ?
he showed me the secret sanctum .
you have to tell them .
my parents are the greatest superheroes on the planet .
everybody expects greatness from me .
well , you are great .
thanks .
ok , so you' re a sidekick .
it' s not the end of the world .
when life gives you lemons ...
make apple juice ?
i can' t make lemons .
i don' t know what it is .
yeah , but see , no .
you have an awesome power .
you could have made hero easy .
i' m not into labels .
but why would you choose to be a sidekick ?
because i think the whole thing is stupid .
dividing people into groups like that .
i mean ... ... what is this ?
high school ?
apple ?
thanks .
morning , class .
welcome to hero support .
my name is ... ... all american boy !
' course , nowadays ...
ooh ! ... i just go by mr. boy .
but this year , it will be my privilege to help each of you become the very best hero support that you can be .
without hero support , why , there wouldn' t be any heroes .
all right , there probably would be heroes , but they would be very lonely .
lonely heroes indeed .
and ...
yes ?
uh , yeah , um , when do we pick our names and costumes ?
because i call dibs on " zach attack .
well , you don' t get to pick .
on graduation day , you' il be assigned to your hero , and then he or she will , uh , decide what you will be called and what you will wear .
i think this is mostly done in an attempt to avoid clashing colors .
that' s why when i was paired with ... ... the commander , red , white and blue it was , which for me was a very good thing because , uh , as you can see , blue really just makes my eyes pop !
it' s very dramatic .
huh .
uh , excuse me .
i didn' t know you worked for the commander .
i worked with the commander .
we were a team ,
mr ...
mr ...
stronghold !
stronghold .
you steve' s son ?
yeah .
and he never mentioned me to you .
i don' t ...
i don' t think so .
makes sense .
that makes perfect sense , because the commander does not have time to sit around flipping through scrapbooks that i took the time to make for him .
no , the commander' s got to be out there saving the world !
with your mom .
your mom .
she ever mention me ?
uh ...
incoming !
oh , look .
he does glow .
i told you .
greetings .
little misfire in the mad science lab .
no need to panic , unless you' re a single cell organism .
mr. medulla , we in hero support are trained never to panic .
my bad .
i' il get the nurse ... unless she' s injured .
ah !
through being cool ]
change ... and ho !
now you .
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
go back .
ok , number one .
a radioactive zombie is charging at your hero .
a ) his silver tipped crossbow ;
b ) a wooden spike ; c ) ...
yo , that' s so weak , man .
i' m holding his crossbow .
why can' t i shoot him myself ?
' cause we' re hero support .
and if your hero asks for a crossbow ,
you hand it to him .
or her .
by the way , zach , you can' t kill a zombie .
you can only re kill him .
or her .
if you kids are all in here , who' s out there saving the world ?
dad .
why are you home so early ?
after i stopped the superdome from collapsing ,
i was watching the game and got to thinking ,
it' s been a while since will and i tossed the old pigskin around .
i thought i' d hustle back home , but i see you and layla have already made new friends .
it' s an honor to meet you , sir .
what' s your name , your power ?
i' m ethan , and i melt .
ok .
zach .
i glow .
i see .
magenta .
i shape shift .
shape shift !
into a guinea pig .
great .
great .
great .
great !
really great .
well !
i make a mean tuna fish salad sandwich .
anybody want one ?
no , no , no .
pleasure meeting everyone .
they' re a good bunch of kids , will .
yeah .
can i ask you something , though ?
does that one kid really , you know , glow ?
sometimes .
boy , they have really lowered the bar some for superheroes at that school since i went there .
well , actually , he' s a sidekick .
oh .
well , that makes sense .
yeah .
actually , they' re all sidekicks .
good for you , son .
kid of your stature hangir out with a bunch of sidekicks .
as a freshman ?
i didn' t have the guts .
and i can only imagine what your grandfather would have said if i' d have brought some of them home .
you know , there' s nothing wrong
with being a sidekick , dad .
oh , no .
of course not .
i used to have one .
saved my life once too .
old ... what' s his name .
so then you would be fine with ... ... if i was a sidekick .
well , yeah , sure , i guess .
hey , hand me that mayonnaise there .
well , that' s good then , because ... because i am .
am what ?
a sidekick .
who is ?
me , dad .
dad , i' m a sidekick , ok ?
i washed out of power placement .
washed out !
boomer .
couldrt make the big time , so now he thinks he can pass judgment on some real heroes ' kids , huh ?
oh , it' s a power trip , will .
that' s all it is .
sonic boom ?
try " gym teacher man .
no , dad !
what are you doing ?
i' m calling the school .
the tuition we pay them !
dad , don' t .
dad !
it' s not coach boomer !
it' s me , ok ?
i don' t have any powers .
but you never said ...
i mean , you made it seem like ...
like i had super strength like you ?
but i don' t .
but you will , will !
you' re just ...
you' re just a late bloomer !
that' s what it is !
maybe .
maybe not .
but i don' t care .
because , really , the fact of the matter is
i' m proud to be a sidekick .
actually , i' m proud to be hero support .
uh , so i , uh , think we pretty much covered the undead .
what' s next ?
what ?
your hero flies north at 300 miles per hour for 15 minutes .
his archenemy is tunneling south at 200 miles per hour for 10 minutes .
assuming your hero has x ray vision , how long before he realizes he' s going the wrong way ?
all i ever wanted for him was to save the world .
to just feel that once .
that' s a lot to put on a 14 year old' s shoulders .
oh , come on , josie !
when i was his age , i could put a truck on my shoulders .
oh !
honey , i know you' re disappointed .
so am i. you think i didn' t want to see my son fly ?
or have super strength ?
or fly ?
but we can' t change who he is .
not without dropping him in a vat of toxic waste .
steve !
aw ...
oh , no , no ...
where would we even find a vat of ...
steve !
i i just , i' m thinking .
will is a great kid .
this is not the end of the world .
ok .
so maybe we won' t be the stronghold three , the greatest family of superheroes the world has ever known .
but we will be the stronghold three , the greatest family the world has ever known .
you' re right .
you' re right , and he can always go into real estate !
welcome to sky hi ...
come on , ron .
hey , big boy .
where' s your hat ?
hey , where' s your hat ?
if you' re not gonna respect me , at least respect the hat !
oh , pfff !
guys .
guys , come on .
give ron his hat back .
all right .
you' re the sidekick .
give him his hat back .
we' il catch you later , stronghold .
hey , race you up the steps .
thanks , will .
sure , ron .
over here !
saved you a seat !
hey , and i saved you a pudding !
hey , what' s up ?
hey , buddy .
check this out .
whoa !
uh ... sorry .
you will be .
let' s not do this .
you think you can do whatever you want ' cause your name' s stronghold ?
i' m sorry my dad put your dad in jail , but ...
nobody talks about my father .
ah !
oh , it is so on !
fight , fight , fight !
mr. boy , do something !
i' m on it !
principal powers !
principal powers !
principal powers !
principal powers !
principal powers !
fight , fight , fight !
oooh !
hurry up !
move out of the way !
oh !
where are your sidekicks , sidekick ?
right here !
yeah .
leave them alone !
he' s strong !
i' m strong ?
he' s super strong .
yeah , will !
now , who tripped me ?
stronghold !
what if i said it' s not just her twin ?
it' s her evil twin .
this friday , you say ?
medulla , you dog !
think i can' t take a hit ?
will !
will !
pull the pin !
he' s comir , man !
hi .
i didn' t do anything , though .
he started it .
your dad started it , and i' m gonna finish it .
don' t bother .
the detention room neutralizes all super powers .
sit .
now , here at sky high we do everything we can to teach you how to use your powers .
but what you do with them , now that' s up to you .
living up to your father' s reputation or trying to live it down is a sad waste of talent .
your talent .
try to keep that in mind the next time you' re about to do something stupid .
all right , look .
whatever happened with our dads , it has nothing to do with us .
what do you say ?
i say if you ever cross me again , i' il roast you alive .
so , will , anything interesting happen at school today ?
uh ...
well , as you may have noticed , i got my powers today !
yes , we know .
the principal called .
ok .
look , it' s not ...

dude , you made sidekick history !
aw .
i don' t know about that .
dude , you made sidekick history !
aw .
i don' t know about that .
no , seriously .
from now on , people mess with us at their own peril .
you' re breaking down barriers , proving we' re not heroes and sidekicks .
we' re just people .
super people .
seats , please .
we have a lot to cover this morning , starting with motorcycle sidecar basics .
uh , except for you , mr. stronghold .
would you gather your gear and come up here , please ?
i' ve got your new class schedule .
congratulations .
you' ve been transferred to the hero class .
oh , and by the way , if you should find yourself needing any hero support ,
i still do a little freelance .
ha !
ha !
but what about them ?
we' il see you on the bus .
we' il hang at lunch .
right after you' ve dunked ethars head in the toilet .
well , you best not be late .
just go already .
rays !
from the silliness of the shrink ray to the devastation of the death ray .
these are the very foundations of mad science .
yes ?
they told me you were coming .
unfortunately , all the lab partners are taken .
i suppose i could pair you with my teaching assistant .
miss grayson ?
my apologies .
true ]
come on .
come on !
quickly , quickly , quickly .
feet !
you stepped on my foot !
ok , how' s that ?
perfect ... if you' re building a heat ray .
you' re supposed to be building a freeze ray .
ok , i have no idea what i' m doing .
dreadful technique .
you' ve confused rays with beams !
d !
minus !
i' d give you an f , but that would only mean having to see you in summer school .
and what have we here ?
uh ...
well , i don' t know .
i didn' t do it .
you' re far too modest , mr. stronghold .
or perhaps not modest enough .
miss grayson , in the future , please allow the students to succeed , or fail , on their own .
how did you do that ?
i' m a technopath .
i can control technology with my mind .
wow .
all i can do is punch stuff .
yet he' il be the one on cereal boxes .
show me the justice in that .
miss fernandez , kindly thaw out mr. hellman .
that was amazing .
so is what you did in the cafeteria .
yeah .
once they start handing out grades for destruction of school property , i' il be in good shape .
you know , i can totally help you out with all this science stuff .
yeah , you' d do that ?

gwen ?
hey .
oh , uh , dad , this is gwen grayson .
gwen grayson , this is dad .
mr. stronghold , it' s such an honor .
i' m sorry to barge in like this .
oh , not at all .
will and i were just hangir .
chillir .
honey , gwen is a technopath , and she' s offered to help will with his science homework .
and she' s a senior .
we said we' d work on that antigravity stuff tomorrow , but something came up .
any chance we can do it tonight ?
sure .
yeah .
on one condition , gwen .
you join us for dinner .
oh , no , i couldn' t intrude .
oh , yes , you can .
you must .
ok .
well , thanks .
so should we get started ?
certainly .
well , she' s gorgeous .
and she fixed the disposal .
really ?
so there we were , in the middle of nowhere , and she' s like , " i can' t change a tire !
i can only change the weather !
i' m like , " can you at least make it stop raining ?
uh , i' il give him a few more minutes .
so , gwen , do we know your parents ?
mmm .
i don' t think so , mrs. stronghold .
dad went inactive a few years ago .
lets mom do all the work now , huh ?
mom passed away when i was a baby .
so i did have an ulterior motive in coming here tonight .
will told you i' m the head of the homecoming committee ?
uh , he most certainly did not .
well , i was wondering if you' d consider attending the homecoming dance .
we would love to chaperone .
sure .
that' s very nice , mrs. stronghold , but no .
we were hoping that you' d be the guests of honor and receive the award for heroes of the year .
still workir on that ?
hey .
hey .
we go to school together .
you' re stronghold' s friend .
yeah .
yeah .
you want me to heat that up for you ?
you' re not supposed to use your powers outside of school .
i was just gonna stick it in the microwave .
uh , i was supposed to be meeting will here , but , um ...
you want to sit down ?
i think i can spare a minute .
oh , look , hon .
there' s ...
what' s his name ?
kid with the gravity .
lance , i think .
lance something .
yeah .
oh , my gosh , look .
there' s boomer .
he had a mullet ? !
oh , god .
oh , whoa whoa whoa .
remember her ?
hmm ?
she was a weird one .
oh , yeah .
sue tenny .
disappeared right before graduation .
why is that ?
no one ever really knew .
some say she was , uh , recruiting villains at the school .
others say she was smoking in the girls ' room .
nightmare .
all right , now .
speaking of villains , there' s one of the worst .
baron battle .
warrers dad ?
always swore he' d have his revenge on me .
and he totally stole the lead in oklahoma !
you have to stop caring about that .
it' s a long time ago .
hon.
don' t wanna talk about it !
you deserved it .
then there was this time in first grade .
you know how you grow lima beans in school ?
will could not figure out why mine grew so quickly .
it was driving him crazy .
so finally i took mercy on him and i told him about my powers , and we' ve been best friends ever since .
hmm .
and falling for him , was that before or after the lima beans ?
what ?
i am not in love with will strong ...
is it that obvious ?
yeah .
great .
so why don' t you tell him ?
well , i was gonna ask him to homecoming , but there' s two problems .
he likes somebody else , and she' s perfect .
hmm .
you know what i think ?
to let true love remain unspoken is the quickest route to a heavy heart .
wow .
that is really deep .
yeah .
and your lucky numbers are ... ... four , 16 , five and 49 .
i gotta go .
see you around , hippie .
you didn' t have to walk me home .
true ]
i did if i wanted to spend any time alone with you .
and , just so you know ,
i don' t usually hang out all night with my mom and dad .
your parents are great , will .
i' m so glad they' re coming to homecoming .
now , if i could only find someone to go with .
you don' t have a date for homecoming ?
well , i' ve gotten a few offers , but ... ... i turned them down .
i' m just waiting for the right guy .
oh .
you , will .

oh , hi , daddy .

you' re a hero , she' s a sidekick .
she was holding you back .
what ?
why would you do that ?
layla' s been my best friend since first grade .
you' ve got new friends now , and i think that you need to figure out whether you want to hang with us or with those losers .

i wouldn' t be surprised if layla or any of the other guys
ever want to talk to me again .

you must have been a real jerk .
because no matter what i do ,
i can' t get ' em to stop talking to me .
thanks .
one thing leads to another ]
hey , you want to dance ?

hey there , layla .

oh , don' t worry .
the bubbles are just ginger ale .
oops .

thanks a lot .
i thought you werert gonna rent a tux .

cheese cube ?
we' re taking off now , hon .
still time to change your mind and come with us .
nah , i don' t think so .
mom , you ever feel like you messed something up so bad that you' il never be able to fix it ?
people make mistakes , will .
that' s what high school' s about .
heck , that' s what life' s about .
the key is to learn from them .
i hope my friends see it that way .
if someone is a true friend , you' d be surprised at how understanding they can be .
thanks .
do me a favor ?
put this away for me .
i caught your father sneaking it out under his cape .
he' s convinced that everyone wants to reminisce with him .
i bet .

that' s weird .
gwen ?
oh , no .
oh , no .
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
i gotta get to sky high .
josie , wait .
we can' t unveil the stronghold three without will .
it' s just ... it' s just not the same .
maybe we should fly home .
and we really don' t need another award .
welcome , commander and jetstream !
good evening .
first , a quick announcement .
the owner of the blue cold fusion powered jet pack , you left your lights on .
sorry .
sorry .
excuse me .
sorry .
and now , please help me welcome the head of the homecoming committee , the girl who made all this possible , gwen grayson .
thank you , principal powers .
and a very special thank you goes to our guests of honor and the recipients of our first ever hero of the year award ,
the commander and jetstream .
and to mark this occasion , we' ve planned a special tribute to the most powerful super being ever to walk the halls of sky high .
me !
commander ?
royal pain is a girl ?
yes , i' m a girl , you idiot !
how i ever lost to a fool like you i' il never know .
now prepare to be pacified !
do you honestly think you can kill me with that little toy gun of yours ?
my dear commander , who said anything about killing you ?
ahhh !
josie !
i' ve always ...
rock a bye , baby !

boomer !

you' re never gonna believe this .
gwen ...
is royal pairs daughter .
yeah , and she ...
stole the pacifier .
right .
she turned everybody into babies , including your parents .
ok .
that i didn' t know .
this is even more than the great will stronghold can handle .
she' s right .
it' s gonna take all of us .
all of who ?
you and warren ?
the rest of us are only sidekicks .
just because you have powers , that doesn' t make you a hero .
sometimes it just makes you a jerk .
makes me a jerk .
i guess what i' m trying to say is ...
we get it .
you' ve been a jerk .
layla , in case my homecoming date ends up killing me tonight ,
i just want you to know ...
isn' t that sweet ?
i hate sweet !
you guys are a part of this too ?
why am i not surprised ?
go take care of gwen .
we' il handle these clowns .
go .
whoa !
while pushing down on the infant restraint , pinch the two straps together .
pinch , royal , pinch .
pinch what ?
restraint a or b ?
now you just calm down .
let' s go back to one .
ahhh !
come back and fight !
you ...
come on , sidekick !
you gonna fight back ?
i don' t believe in using powers for violence .
i don' t believe you even have any powers !
go , penny !
beat layla !
go , penny !
beat layla !
you can' t hide forever , sidekick !
no way .
sucks for you !
cootchie cootchie coo !
i take you back , my dear commander , to your senior year at sky high , a time before anyone knew what a technopath was .
so a brilliant but misunderstood girl named sue tenny was written off as a science geek and stuck in sidekick class .
she hatched a plan , so daring , so visionary , to start her very own supervillain academy and raise a generation of heroes from scratch as villains .
but first she had to destroy the very institution that dared to spurn her genius !
and now , so many years later , that plan is complete .
that this may be the finest supervillain speech ever given , and you don' t even know what i' m saying .
but i do .
look .
i' m sorry that my parents destroyed your mom .
now put my dad down .
no one could defeat royal pain .
when the pacifier exploded , i wasrt destroyed .
i was merely turned into a baby .
stitches took me away and raised me as his daughter .
daddy' s little girl .
i told you never to call me that !
lunatic !
that' s right .
royal pain wasrt my mother .
royal pain is me !
oh , my god .
i made out with an old lady .
yoo hoo !
right here !
whoa , whoa , whoa !
way to go , popsicle .
hmm !
big mistake .
but i thought you were a sidekick !
i am a sidekick .
don' t leave us here to die !
royal pain sabotaged the antigravity device !
the whole school' s gonna fall out of the sky !
we only have 10 minutes !
here' s the antigravity room .
didrt royal pain seal off every route ?
what about this conduit ?
right .
you' d have to be like a rat to fit in there .
oh , great .
this is so stupid .
ok .
ok , you' re doir great , magenta .
looks great .
look at those cute little legs .
ok , go about 10 feet .
yeah , there should be a opening on your right .
gotcha !
find the access panel .
what ?
it leads to the generator .
i' m on it !
will !
no !
and there goes your last chance of stopping me .
we' il see about that !
huh ?
surprised ?
so am i.
you' re flying ?
that' s impossible !
ah !
there' s only one person authorized to transport superheroes .
and that' s ron wilson , bus driver .
and i' m ron wilson , bus driver .
i found the generator ...
i think .
chew the wire to the scrambler .
cut the wire connected to the scrambler .
the red one .
what ?
cut the red wire !
there' s a lot of red wires down here .
uh oh .
the school is falling !
ahhh !
chew !
chew the wire !
all unpacked , and the movers didn' t break a thing .
told you we didn' t need that extra insurance .
no , i know .
oh , no !
it' s all on you !
hold me !
hold me !
ahhh !
whoa .
that could have been messy .
good night .
ohh !
chester ?
chester ?
now what ?
beats me .
perhaps i can be of assistance .
it should only take me a couple of hours to reconfigure the pacifier .
mr. peace , would you please carry me to the mad science lab ?
sure .
and , mr. peace .
yeah .
regrettably , i have made boom boom .
people , if you' ve already been de pacified , please find your clothes , grab a baby and report to the science lab .
mom ?
dad ?
guys ?
i just want to say sorry because this whole thing was my fault .
honey , you can' t blame yourself .
' course not .
how were you supposed to know your girlfriend was a psychopath ?
no , that' s not it .
um , you gave me one rule , and i broke it .
i took her into the sanctum , and that' s how she got the pacifier .
the whole party was a trap .
and so was the homecoming , will .
we all fell into royal pairs trap , but you defeated her .
you saved sky high , and everyone in her .
i didn' t do it by myself .
excuse me .
steve ?
josie ?
even though it appears gwen only came up with this award as a way to lure you to the dance and your ultimate doom , still it' s inscribed , so ...
i' d be honored to accept this " hero of the year " award .
but i' m afraid this doesn' t belong to us .
it belongs to them .
the sidekicks .
i mean , hero support .
why don' t we just call them what they really are , josie ?
heroes .
oh , and , jonathan ?
whatever you' re teaching them , keep teaching them it .
sure .
what a waste .
i can' t do anything more to help you .
i' m not wonder woman , you know .
i went through puberty twice ... for this ?
i have de pacified all the babies and destroyed that horrible weapon forever .
let' s boogie !
melt with you ]
this is so sweet , i could hurl .
tell me about it .
do you wanna dance ?
yes !
i mean , yeah .
yeah .
compared to homecoming , the rest of the year was pretty boring .
gwen and her gang got what they deserved .
but now nobody wants to save the citizen .
uncle !
uncle !
relax .
i' m just kidding .
but they are getting to spend a lot of quality time together .
oh , yeah , and ron wilson , bus driver , fell into a vat of toxic waste .
he now works for the mayor , defending the city from giant robots .
so in the end , my girlfriend became my archenemy , my archenemy became my best friend and my best friend became my girlfriend .
but , hey , that' s high school .
save it for later ]
