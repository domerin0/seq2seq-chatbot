get the corpse from the well .
yes , sir .
mr yamamura .
don' t .
i haven' t seen her since she was a child .
the well was on dr ikuma' s estate .
it was sealed when they sold the place 30 years ago ... ... and it was never opened after that .
but that is sadako .
there' s no record of a " sadako " , not in dr ikuma' s or the mother' s family .
what happened to dr ikuma ?
he died right after the place was sold .
i' m the only one left alive .
burn her !
dispose of the ashes wherever you want .
i' m afraid that' s not possible .
it' s a very strange case .
one of the people who found her is dead , and the other' s vanished .
and there' s one more thing ...
the time of death .
according to the autopsy she died only a year or two ago .
what ?
that means that she was alive down there the entire time ...
for 30 years .
everyone' s talking about this " video curse " .
what happens in it ?
i' ve heard that it' s a creepy woman  who tells you that you will die in one week' s time .
they say she appears if you watch tv late at night .
then the phone rings .
tv ?
what channel ?
some localstation in izu .
izu ?
do you really want to use this ?
why not ?
you die if you don' t show it to someone within a week ...
we' il have to get someone to say that on camera .
still no word from reiko ?
no .
the police called about her .
is asakawa reiko here ?
no , not at the moment .
everyone' s talking about this " video curse " .
what happens in it ?
i' ve heard that it' s a creepy woman  who tells you that you will die in one week' s time .
excuse me !
do you know what this is all about ?
we haven' t heard from her .
a man named takayama ryuji died .
takayama ?
ms asakawa' s ex husband .
the police have been here , too .
she' s been gone for days .
have they been inside ?
no .
they never asked .
go ahead .
ms takano ...
what' s that ?
a videotape ?
forgive me , father !
i had to save yoichi .
are you okay ?
she asked me about a video when i saw her ...
she' s a single mother , so they don' t assign her important stories .
that' s right !
her boy !
he was in school ...
ms asakawa ?
she' s not here right now .
this is the police .
ms asakawa' s father was found dead this morning .
where' s mr kadokura ?
over there .
sir ?
yes ?
omuta , shizuoka police .
thanks for coming .
have you found the daughter ?
no .
the woman in the well ?
we' re reconstructing the face .
we' re going to make a model and ask around the area .
he found the body .
hang on ...
do you want to see him ?
people don' t usually die like that .
are you recording something ?
yes .
we' re wondering if it has anything to do with this note .
reiko , i got rid of the tape .
there' s nothing to worry about now .
he' s been absent more than ten days .
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
why are you looking for reiko ?
i want to find out why professor takayama died .
i' il check around .
i' il call you if i find anything .
bye .
yes ?
it' s the police .
i know it' s late , but i' d like to ask about takayama ryuji .
ms takano mai ?
first on the scene ?
yes .
can i come in ?
please .
that' s right ...
professor takayama taught math , didn' t he ?
and you are ... ?
his assistant .
have you ever heard of yamamura sadako ?
no .
her mother shizuko ?
no .
ikuma heihachiro ?
no .
takayama ryuji and asakawa reiko were looking for something , right ?
i' m afraid i don' t know .
i see .
asakawa reiko' s father was found dead today .
in a similar state to professor takayama .
do you know what i mean ?
go away , please .
they' d found a corpse in a well .
a woman who died a year or two ago .
but that well was sealed 30 years ago .
it' s hard to imagine , right ?
almost 30 years down there in the dark ...
neither of the hands had nails .
they were found in the sides of the well , where she had tried ...
go away !
all right .
call me if you hear where asakawa reiko is .
i' m sorry .
it' s just such a strange case .
what' s the " video " all about ?
i don' t know .
nope ...
do you live around here , professor ?
yes .
i can concentrate better here than in my apartment .
we' re rolling .
pick up where we left off .
three seconds ...
you have to copy it and show it to someone within a week .
if you don' t , exactly one week later ...
so there was an original video that people copied ?
where did it come from ?
it was just there .
everyone has tapes that they don' t know what' s on .
one had this weird stuff on it .
how can you tell that it' s that tape ?
you' il know .
does anyone have this tape ?
i know people .
they' re scared , so they' re all showing it to each other .
have you seen it ?
can you get me a copy ?
okay .
look ...
excuse me .
work out a price .
she was probably after these four .
they all died exactly one week after they watched the tape .
it' s hard to believe , right ?
this is tomoko .
she was ms asakawa' s niece .
there was a friend with her ...
kurahashi ...
kurahashi masami .
what happened to her ?
she can' t speak .
she' s in the hospital at the university .
the doctor can' t talk about a specific patient .
you can only ask about his research .
all right .
this way , please .
ms kurahashi ?
how are you feeling ?
would you like to sit outside for a while ?
the doctor said the air would do you good .
are you still afraid of the tv ?
i' il bring a partition so you won' t have to see it .
okay ?
they' re here , doctor .
myname' s kawajiri .
have a seat .
we put photos of our patients in their files .
do you know why ?
in case they run off .
that' s right .
illness can change people to the point where their families don' t know them .
so we always take pictures .
but when we photographed this patient ... ... using an ordinary camera ... ... we came across something strange .
it' s called " spiritphotography " .
something in a person' s mind affects the light .
there have been many cases .
is that what' s happened here ?
we tried just having her hold the film ...
do you see the character ?
sada
you probably think i' m crazy .
the entire university does .
did you know takayama ryuji ?
yes .
he was the only one who would listen to me .
he studied medicine before he switched to math .
do you know he' s dead ?
it was a real shame .
then why didn' t you attend his funeral ?
you can' t see it , right ?
there' s no need to rush .
just take it nice and easy .
what' s wrong ?
are you feeling ill ?
ms kurahashi ...
get her out of here .
tomoko ?
tomoko ?
help me ...
help me ...
restrain her !
help me !
they said that was the first time she has spoken .
are you going to proceed with ms asakawa' s story ?
yes .
i wouldn' t do that .
why not ?
i just wouldn' t .
did the girl tell you anything ?
wait !
i' m sorry .
don' t tell anyone .
the power you have now won' t save anyone .
yoichi !
are you yoichi ?
where do you live ?
can' t you talk ?
go in there .
it' s not much of a place .
have a seat .
i want to go to school .
i' m hungry .
well ?
do you remember masami ?
she was with tomoko when she died .
yes .
she passed a tv set at the hospital , and something strange appeared .
what was it ?
a well .
you could only see it for a second .
was that it ?
yes .
you' ve seen it too , haven' t you ?
you' il be all right , if that' s all .
but i wouldn' t look at it again .
masami can' t speak either .
so ?
if yoichi goes on like this ...
so what should i do ?
lock him away in some hospital ?
what' s it got to do with you ?
i' m sorry .
please leave .
can i come back and see yoichi sometime ?
hi .
here .
you got it ?
we said 20, 000 , right ?
i watched it last night .
mr okazaki , you' il watch it too , won' t you ?
sure .
there' s no point if i don' t .
do you promise ?
of course .
trust me !
hang on .
the money ...
don' t forget .
nice catch .
here it comes .
are you studying that already ?
why were you at the station the other day ?
was your mom angry ?
was there someone there ?
the woman with long hair .
let' s eat .
go and wash your hands .
i think yoichi won' t speak because he blames me .
that' s not true .
after we left my dad' s place , the tv would come on when yoichi came near .
could you talk to dr kawajiri ?
if he' s like tomoko' s friend masami ...
you' ve seen asakawa reiko .
i didn' t call him .
a reporter asked us about a patient .
he' il be here soon .
we' re going to try an experiment .
it might help the boy , too .
come in .
this way .
what are you going to do ?
this is tap water .
the paper can absorb ...
... about that much .
just like before .
concentrate on the water .
that' s good .
the water has changed .
some kind of energy has gone from her to the water .
we can explain the film the same way .
it' s energytransfer .
in time all the energy should be transferred .
we' re going to try that now .
have a seat .
are you going to record this ?
yes .
just like with the pictures .
but you' il see the well .
a well ?
everyone who sees it dies .
you' re still alive .
hayashi ... mr okazaki .
this is a blank tape .
can you set it up ?
masami !
this is dangerous .
if everyone sees it ...
there' s something in my head .
quick !
the tape .
even if we get it on tape , videos don' t kill .
fear can kill .
prove that , and the energy will dissipate .
you can leave if you want to .
no .
begin .
just like with the photo film .
relax and look at the camera .
what' s that sound ?
who' s that ?
doctor !
ms kurahashi !
what are you doing ?
some girl called for you ...
she said that it' s been a week .
was it the girl with the tape ?
right .
i' il give her a call .
good night .
sawaguchi .
is this kanae ?
yes .
it' s okazaki .
i' ve watched the tape .
great !
i was really scared .
don' t you trust me ?
it was almost time ...
you know that strange woman ... the one in the mirror ?
hello ?
yes , that' s the one .
didn' t it look like she changed into a child for a second ?
just before you could see the well .
where' s the tape now ?
i got rid of it .
it' s too dangerous .
nobody else should see it .
but you have to show it to someone !
you have to , mr okazaki .
i don' t want you to die .
all right .
see you , then .
the woman in the mirror ...
reporter dies witnessing psychic test
the test destroyed the reputation of a certain dr ikuma heihachiro .
the fatal demonstration yamamura shizuko and dr ikuma
shizuko ...
you can' t just will someone dead .
dr ikuma spoke about how intention is a living thing ... ... and how energy of thought could take physical form .
30 years in a well ... 30 years of concentrated thought ... ... wanting revenge .
we' ve all seen it .
did takayama and ms asakawa' s father see it before they died ?
why the father ?
did her boy see it ?
him , too ?
just like the girl .
this can' t go on .
where' s ms asakawa ?
tell me !
yes ?
kanae !
kanae !
come with me .
we just want to ask a few questions .
don' t worry .
just a minute ...
get away from here !
run !
can' t you hear me ?
run !
what' s wrong ?
mom !
yoichi !
freak !
freak !
murderer !
freak !
yoichi !
yoichi !
yoichi !
dad ?
dad !
we didn' t save yoichi ?
your child isn' t yoichi anymore .
yoichi ...
yoichi ...
no !
stop it !
okay .
why won' t this erase ?
who did the story start with ?
it never really starts with anyone .
people get anxious , and rumors start to fly .
professor ?
what' s wrong ?
let' s go .
does it look like her ?
yes ... just as strange .
we' il take some pictures .
that' s good .
sadako !
why did you leave me alive ?
i was the one who made you and your mother into a freak show !
do you want me to return you to the sea ?
is that it ?
do you know the yamamuras in sashikiji ?
there are lots of yamamuras around here .
a woman named shizuko lived here .
oh , there ...
the yamamura inn
hello ?
this way .
i' m sorry .
did i wake you up ?
no .
can you promise me something ?
what ?
don' t do that again , no matter what happens .
it' s really scary .
okay ?
are you on my side ?
of course i am .
okay .
i put sadako in the sea .
it' s the only thing i could do .
that' s what shizuko did with her .
she went off alone when she went into labor .
she came home with a flat stomach , saying she' d put the baby in the sea .
but the next day she came back , and the child was with her .
what' s that sound ?
it' s the cave where sadako was born .
the river of offering " .
unwanted children were put here , so the tide would take them .
who was sadako' s father ?
hello ?
yes ?
is ms takano mai staying here ?
no .
well , at least you have vacancies ...
sir !
sadako !
you' re dead !
you' re dead !
you' re safe !
do you remember what you dreamt about last night ?
okay .
think of your mother .
that' s good .
can i speak to you ?
the thing that controls him is anger .
his anger summons her .
he can' t control it .
my equipmentis on its way .
i' il try to make sadako disappear .
there are no ghosts , no next world .
despite what takayama said .
will yoichi be strong enough ?
what' s your suggestion ?
what if the police show up ?
he can channel the energy .
he' s the best medium .
i' il do it .
are you as strong as takayama ?
yes .
that doesn' t mean you' il be better than the boy .
what if i saw the video ?
all right .
all we need now is water .
water ?
sea water doesn' t permeate as well .
we need fresh water to absorb sadako' s bitterness .
guide the energy into the water .
it will dissolve there .
and sadako will disappear ...
all right ?
yes .
take your places .
remember that i' m on your side .
begin .
close your eyes .
remember what you saw .
what did you see ?
yes !
your father and mother are dead .
you' re all alone .
what did you see ?
it' s that woman' s fault your mother died .
she betrayed your mother .
that' s right .
it' s my fault .
good !
just like that .
dr kawajiri !
what' s that ?
i can see into the next world .
sadako ...
sadako ...
take me !
please .
take me ... ... and put an end to this !
no !
are you okay ?
don' t let go .
let me fall .
grab the wall .
i can' t hold you .
grab the wall !
ms takano ...
it' s all right .
no more !
yoichi !
yoichi ?
yoichi !
take him .
professor ...
yoichi , give me your fear .
give it to me !
give it to me !
climb the rope !
don' t look back .
help me ...
why are you the only one saved ?
are you still scared ?
no .
are you ?
me ?
a little bit .
how' s okazaki doing ?
he' s still in the hospital .
the hospital ?
where' s the key for this ?
isn' t it this one ?
mr okazaki .
i need to take your picture .
can you look this way ?
mr okazaki ?
look this way .
there you go .
thanks .
