you say how much you' re paying .
how much you got for the old one .
mortgage .
interest rates .
stamp duty .
solicitor' s fees .
how much you' il get if the new one goes up in value .
that' s called equity .
personally , i think , ' so what ? '
money' s just a thing .
and things change .
one minute something' s there and you can cuddle up to it .
the next minute it' s gone .
like a malteser .
that goes in the kitchen .
is this fantastic or what ?
surprisingly spacious , with attractive views .
oh , that' s anthony' s .

no one sir , he' s a saint .
oh that' s better , go on .
he was so worried that he might say something bad .
that he said nothing at all for twenty years .
we could do with a couple like him in this class .
thank you , damian .
i like a lot of virgin martyrs too .
like saint agatha .
she ripped her own eyes out , so she wouldn' t have to marry this man .
or saint katherine of alexandria .
they tried to kill her by crushing her to death on a wheel .
but she made the wheel explode and all the splinters killed people in the crowd .
the patron saint of fireworks .
that' s where we get the catherine wheel from .
i did say thank you , damian .
right , i brought in this picture .
this is a hero of mine .

do you know how many times we' d have to visit pizza hut to get rid of all the money ?
one thousand , three hundred and three point five one seven times .
it' s just not practical .
we should buy property .
see this house , we could buy two like that .
if they knocked some off the asking price .
and if we did buy property , that' il go up in value .
so we' d have even more money .
damian ?
excuse me ?
are you poor ?
beg your pardon ?
are you poor ?
are you asking for money ?
me ?
no .
because we don' t have any .
we live in a community , you know , it' s very basic .
we don' t have a dishwasher for instance or a microwave .

hello .
what are they singing ?
they are praying for rain .
where i come from ... people have to pay a tenth of their daily income on water .
it' s so expensive that they can' t afford to wash their hands .
so they get disease .
you don' t need fancy hospitals or medicines to make life better , just a well .
and you ... can build a well for as little as one hundred pounds .
that' s fantastic !
thanks .
i' m sorry i don' t know who you are .

loads of money .
we' ve been saving it up for ages .
you can have it if you need it .
come on damian .
you' il have to change it quickly .
do you think that was really enough ?
more than enough .
that' s him completely sorted out .
right .
have you given money to anyone else ?
not really .
what ?
it wasn' t that much .
just like a bagful .
what' s that ?
scuba scooter .
it goes at ten mile an hour for up to five hours .
we could have one of them .
we could have one each .
we could have a whole fleet .
she' s nice .
huh !
i' ve seen better .
close the door .
look you can see it protruding .
what is it ?
it' s a nipple .
what' s it for ?
well it' s for feeding babies .
did mum have one ?
two .
they' ve all got two .
and did she feed us with them ?
yeah , course she did .
i remember .
you can' t remember when you were a baby .
i don' t remember her doing it to me .
i remember her doing it to you .
anthony ?
what ?
i thought you' d done the washing up ?
i did it !
what do you call that glob ?
hello what' s your name ?
keegan .
alright , k , what' s happened to your finger ?
that' s quality .
pure scary , pure scary .
hey , give me your money .
come on , empty your pockets .
hey you !
excuse me , excuse me !
give me all your money .
come on , every copper .
who feels sorry for poor children ?
correct answer .
everybody sitting up nicely ?
ok .
so , as you know , we' re going to have new money in the new year .
does anybody know how much a euro is worth in pounds ?
yes .
sixty seven p .
spot on .
here , there' s a little prize for you .
it' s your own euro converter .
now !
who else wants one ?
anybody ?
me !
ohh .
everybody .
ok .
so , who can tell me how much two pence is worth in euros ?
mmm .
well i' il tell you .
it' s worth not very much .
almost nothing .
to you .
but if we all put our two pences together .
then we' il have a lot of two pences won' t we ?
yes .
how many people are there here ?
one ... two ... three ... four ...
five ... six ... seven ... eight ...
two hundred and fifty .
sorry ?
there' s two hundred and fifty in the school .
oh clever clogs head master .
ok two hundred and fifty .
so if you each gave me two pence , then i' d have five pounds .
it' s not that much here .
but in ethiopia five pounds could feed a family for a week .
and if you all gave me two two pences , then we' d have a tenner .
and that' s enough to provide that village with a source of clean water forever .
it' s no good to you .
so chuck it in the bin .
excuse me .
give me all your money !
come on , every copper .
get out of my way .
hey you !
hey , give me your money !
come on .
empty your pockets .
hello , what' s your name ?
damian .
hi damian .
i' m the bin .
hello bin .
damian , you' il give me some money won' t you ?
yeah .
what did you do ?
you did it again didn' t you ?
what ?
i saw what you did .
how much ?
not much .
she' s nice .
i' ve been thinking .
why don' t we give the money to her ?
so how did it go ?
well ...
a thousand !
what did you bring a thousand to school for ?
can' t you see that that' s suspicious ?
it' s not suspicious .
it' s unusual .
how can it be suspicious ?
it' s our money .
right you lot outside ... come on .
right , that' s enough messing around .
do you know in africa you can build a well for as little as a hundred pounds .
just listen .
it was the most daring , most brilliant , cleverest and biggest robbery on record , ever .
the train was here .
the train , the one with the money ,
used notes .
right the van comes up onto the platform ... here .
it' s a railway van so no one takes any notice .
until ...
they jump out of this van and some of them got hold of the driver .
some of them start shifting the money .
by this time rapid response has been mobilised .
alright , let' s go .
come on !
the van drives off with a reckless disregard for life .
rapid response goes after it .
there' s ... armed units .
dog handlers .
helicopters .
throw everything at them .
the train stays here .
an ambulance comes , takes the driver to hospital .
get another driver .
the cld count the bags .
there' s only one missing .
then rapid response corner the van .
trapped .
the robbers dropped the lot and they leg it !
they' ve got no chance , except ...
newcastle united versus arsenal at highbury .
one all .
disappointing result for the gunners .
please advise car , i think we' ve lost them .
they don' t catch the men .
but that' s alright because when they get back to the van ... there' s the missing bag .
how do you ... how do you know all that ?
his uncle works for the police .
the van has gone .
the train is in the station .
and the cops are in the cop shop making tea .
where are the robbers ?
where' s the last place you' re going to look ?
our house ?
maybe .
so the train moves off with a new driver and all the money .
on the train .
the money was on the train and so was a robber ?
lateral thinking .
the money stays on the train , but so does a robber .
he sits tight .
and every time the train comes to a slow bend he chucks a sack of money out .
they' ve got people waiting all over the country .
could be stafford or crewe .
could be preston or wigan .
runcorn , it could be .
could be here .
damian .
damian .
calm down .
it' il be alright .
no one knows it was us .
i don' t care .
leave me alone .
what you have to tell me for ?
because i wanted you to know the truth .
we have to give it back .
no ... no we can' t do that .
they were going to burn it .
now come on , it isn' t the money' s fault it got stolen .
i thought it was from god .
what ?
well you know sometimes you tell people about mam and they give you money or sweets .
well i told god and ... well who else would have that kind of money ?
well ... in a funny ...
god doesn' t rob banks , alright .
god does not rob banks .
office .
now .
your father' s on his way .
come in .
the mormons !
you stole money from mormons ?
would you like to tell us why you did it anthony ?
our mam' s dead .
hey .
hey .
hey anthony come here .
anthony , damian , come here .
ok .
team talk .
your mother ,
she would not want you , to stand around crying or to steal things .
she wants you to get on with your lives and do the best you can .
make her proud , son , eh ?
and not , you know ... cry .
ok .
so let' s stop crying eh ?
and stealing things .
let' s stop that too .
get in the car .
don' t ever do that to me again .
look .
i' m really sorry it was me .
i didn' t mean to cause any trouble or anything .
no you did right .
they stole it , what could you do ?
they did give it to a good cause .
i wouldn' t have done that at their age .
they must be ... you did a good job .
thanks .
are you from the social ?
no .
i' m just a visitor .
i go round the schools collecting for this water thing .
and try and tell them about the change over , you know .
making sure that the kids understand it .
does anyone understand it ?
sometimes they are a bit confused , until i talk to them .
and then ...
they' re really confused .
i' m sorry .
they' re very sorry .
i' ve sent them to bed .
i want you to know that it won' t happen again .
do you mind me asking how you came to have so much cash in the house ?
it was a donation .
it was left here anonymously .
and you weren' t suspicious about that ?
no , we pray a lot and we thought it was the answers to our prayers .
only it has been mentioned that you spent close to five thousand pounds in comet ...
a few days ago .
digital television .
mircowave oven .
dishwasher .
foot spa .
did you actually pray for all of these things ?
we were praying for comfort and encouragement .
i think we felt comforted and encouraged .
by the foot spa ?
and the dishwasher .
samaritans .
oxfam .
christian aid .
for christ' s sake , don' t tick them little boxes .
the ones about putting you in touch with like minded organisations .
you' il be besieged man .
i' m telling you !
saint peter , died ad sixty four .
alright , don' t remind us .
the money ... it' s robbed .
i know .
patron saint of keys , locks and general security , man .
including up there .
i' m on the door .
is it still alright , if it' s robbed ?
can you still do good with it or should you give it back ?
i thought it was a miracle , but it is just robbed .
damian .
listen .
one day i was with you know who , jesus .
and he went up into the mountains and thousands of people followed him .
the police said five thousand , five thousand .
everybody knows this story .
loaves and fishes .
see , i knew you' d say that .
that' s what everybody says .
this yours ?
it' s the key to the old house .
jointed pin tumbler engineering perfection .
anyway , this kid comes up to us , about your size ,
his name was ... no i have forgotten .
i still see him sometimes .
anyway he comes up with these loaves and fishes .
sardines .
and jesus blesses them and passes the plate round .
now the first person he passes it to , passes it on .
he doesn' t take anything .
he just passes it on .
do you know why ?
because he had a piece of lamb hidden in his pocket .
and as he is passing the fish , he sneaks a bit of meat out and pretends he' s taken it off the plate .
do you see what i' m saying ?
and the next person exactly the same story .
every single bastard one of them has their own food .
and every one of them is keeping it quiet .
looking after number one .
but as that plate went round with the sardines on
they all got their own food out and started to share .
and then that plate went all the way round
and back to jesus and it' d still got the fish and the loaves on it .
i think jesus was a bit taken aback .
he says , ' what happened ? '
and i just said ' miracle ' .
and at first i thought i' d fooled him .
but now i see it was a miracle , one of his best .
but this little kid had stood up and ...
everybody there just got bigger .
do you understand what i' m talking about ?
not really .
i' m talking about you .
now i' m really lost .
you' re trying too hard .
that kid he wasn' t planning on doing a miracle .
he wasn' t planning anything , except lunch .
something that looks like a miracle turns out to be dead simple .
but what am i going to do with all this ?
i just want to be good .
look i can' t say too much about this , because of that whole free will thing .
right ?
but ...
see this key ?
keep it safe .
alright ?
and i' il have a word upstairs ...
see if i can get somebody on your case more permanent .
it' s three days left to e day , my true love said to me .
convert your change or donate to charity .
huummmmm , marvellous .
there are just three days left to e day .
remember the money in your bank account has already been converted .
the easiest way to change any cash you have is to pay it into your account .
the sterling becomes euros the moment it' s paid in .
and if you don' t have an account , why not open one today ?
can i help you at all ?
we' d like to open a bank account .
is your mum and dad with you ?
no .
well i need an adult signature .
i need proof of who you are .
oh we thought of that .
leisure pass .
i' m afraid you' re going to have to ask your mum to come in .
this isn' t enough .
just ask your mum to come in .
we can' t .
why not ?
our mam' s dead .
there' s two free euros in here
and you can keep the rest of your money in it .

i had a great evening .
i know what she' s after .

we' re going to have to keep it with us ... all the time .
fill your school bag .
and don' t let it out your sight .
guard it with your life , whatever happens .
ok ?
ok .
damian ?

have you any room ?
no , damian ,
damian he' s tired , he' s walked here all the way from nazareth .
he' s tired .
he' s very , very tired .
well ...
tired .
the walk from nazareth , people did that all the time .
and he was a carpenter .
so he was very fit .
he wasn' t tired .
he was excited .
his wife was going to have a baby .
they weren' t expecting to go to sleep .
ok .
you say excited .
i say tired .
let' s try nervous ?
ok ?
shall we start again ?
joseph the worker , first century , dates uncertain ?
i wouldn' t have said nervous .
i would have said focused .
well , have you any room ?
what did he want to bring her for ?
you invited her .
beginners .
beginners positions .
damian , come on .
the word went out from julius caesar .
caesar ...
caesar augustus that everybody had to go to their home town to be taxed .
so mary and joseph set out for bethlehem .
# little donkey , # little don .
key .
# on the dusty road ...
do you know how much a piece of gold that big would be worth at today' s prices ?
a lot .
an awful lot .
i wonder what happened to it ?
because he was poor after that .
i wonder what he spent it on .
can we please loose the anachronistic bag ?
i don' t think they had addidas in the first century .
far away to the east , three wise men saw a star .
thanks girls .
look a star !
let' s follow it .
# come , they told me , # par um pa pa pa pum
# a new born king to see , # par um pa pum pum
no , saint maureen .
i don' t think i have heard of her .
is she a virgin martyr ?
i don' t think so .
here he is .
he' s always got those bags with him .
pom pom pom ...
do you remember me ?
mmmm ... ?
i' m the poor man .
damian cunningham , what are you doing there ?
come on , where should you be ?
where should you be , you should be in bethlehem , come on .
i can' t believe you' ve got ... no go back ... go back .
as for these .
what have i told you about these ?
i' ve told you before .
ssshhhhh .
back out !
back out !
back out !
shhhhh !
back on !
back on !
they tried first at one inn .
do you have any room at this inn ?
no sorry , we' re fully booked .
do you have any room at this inn ?
we haven' t any room , but we' ve got a stable .
so he took them to the stable ...
oh , this is nice and cosy , joseph ... and cosy joseph ...
i said this is nice and cosy joseph .
damian ?
damian ?
yes , this is where our lord baby jesus will be born .
and so our saviour came , bringing peace to all the earth .
# silent night , holy night ...
quick , come on !
you stay there .
oh no the keys !
oh no !
damian !
what you doing ?
dad !
come here !
oh god !
come here !
come here !
it' s alright .
let' s get you down .
what were you doing ?
is he all right , dad ?
there we go ,
what' s he doing ?
good lad .
well he found it !
it just fell out of the sky .
right in front of me .
i thought it was from god .
from god ?
it' s not really his thing is it , handing out cash ?
why would god hand out ...
two hundred and twenty nine thousand , three hundred and twenty pounds .
blimey !
i was going to give it to the poor , but it was really hard .
why didn' t you tell me ?
anthony said not to , because of the tax .
we could keep some of it though couldn' t we , like a reward ?
get in .
oh !
so what are we going to do with it then ?
we' re going to hand it in .
all of it .
well what else can we do ?
it' s not ours is it ?
hello ?
i called round , the door was open .
i' ve called the police .
i thought you might have come home .
everyone gets burgled at christmas , dad .
this will be your crime number .
so you can get on to your insurance company .
of course they can' t really recompense you for this .
i mean they can' t give you your christmas back can they ?
probably be next christmas by the time you get anything back .
i don' t suppose you' ve got any serial numbers , security codes , anything like that ?
no ?
well , wouldn' t make any difference .
it' s very rare we get anything back .
very rare .
we know the stolen currency is around here somewhere .
that' s what this is all about .
but they can' t do anything about it .
all the banks have been warned to look out for anyone making any large deposits .
and of course , it' s only one day or two , before they realise that the money is worthless .
what' s that ?
it' s nothing , it' s nothing .
it' s just my stuff .
oh dad , don' t .
oh my god !
this is what they were after .
that' s a lot of money .
where did it come from ?
they took our christmas .
we' il take their cash .
you can' t keep it .
you' re going to keep it ?
it belongs to the government .
they were going to burn it .
they were going to burn all this money , that' s a crime if you ask me .
definitely .
but stealing is wrong .
if you steal something , you have to steal it from somebody .
who would we be stealing it from ?
it' s not right !
damian , my house has just been ransacked .
i work every second god sends just to cover the mortgage , to give you a decent home .
and now it' s been wrecked .
i am owed this .
but da ...
go to bed .
now !
do you want a story ?
it' s wrong .
who says ?
god .
yeah , well .
yeah , well what ?
don' t you want to go to heaven ?
look around you , damian .
we' re on our own .
no one is smiling down on us damian .
no one is is looking out for us .
so we' re looking out for ourselves .
but mam ...
is dead .
she' s dead , damian .
you' il never see her again .
and neither will i.
and the money , is ours .
we' il take it to town tomorrow and change it and spend it , do you hear me ?
all of it , because it' s ours .
i know you' ve got it .
it' s mine .
and you' re going to change it tomorrow .
and that' s a good thing .
ok ?
when you come back .
i' m going to call you on this phone .
open the front door .
let me in .
and we' il take the money .
and you won' t have to worry about it any more .
understand ?
you make sure your phone' s switched on .
... fifteen .
you take one side and we' il take the other and then swap .
all right .
ok change what you can and what you can' t change spend .
have a ball !
you do realise , you just kissed goodbye to the money .
come on let' s get cracking .
she' s going to run off with it , you must know that ?
come on !
how can she , she' s got damian ?
she' il kidnap him , hold him to ransom for the rest of the money .
no , anthony , that' s what you' d do .
come on .
ok , you wait here all right ?
it' s mine .
we' il have to change more than this .
no !
what ?
that' s the whole point , do it in small amounts and no one will be suspicious .
look at the queue .
look at the time .
we' il be lucky to get round three banks at this rate .
you' il be lucky to stay out the jail .
go on !
what ?
it' s just quite a lot in the circumstances .
it' s five thousand quid .
it' s the front half of a ford fiesta .
is this a bank or a sweet shop ?
what ?
i need a wee .
tell her that .
can i use your loo ?
well i' m not sure ...
well i' m not queuing up again , the poor kid' s been in here half an hour .
you must have a loo ?
what do you do when you need to go ?
ok , just this once .
you' il have to go here .
i don' t really need one .
you little belter .
i just can' t see why it' s so difficult .
i need a wee .
it' s the front half of a ford fiesta , as far as i' m concerned , that' s ...
i need a wee .
i need a wee .
today' s the day , that britain enters a new currency era .
you must spend or bank any remaining old money today .
it' s now or never .
use it or lose it .
at midnight tonight , it' s euros only for british business .
well if you say so for business ... business is ... now what was your name .
what ?
i' ve got an idea .
what ?
dollars .
change it into dollars now and change it into euros whenever .
actually once all the excitement' s over the euro will most likely drop in value .
so we' il probably get a better exchange rate this way too .
what ?
where did i get you ?
they' ve got a bank in there .
it stays open late .
you know everything , you do , don' t you ?
yeah .
what' s wrong ?
how did you know about the bank ?
is this where your mum worked ?
in here ?
well stay there then .
you' il be alright .
i' il come straight back for you .
i' il do this one .
ok ?
don' t look .
this is where your mum used to work .
nice .
best get a move on , huh ?
go on .
damian ?
what you doing ?
hey , what' s up ?
did you think i' d run off and left you ?
did you ?
well i didn' t , did i ?
no , you didn' t .
the bank' s upstairs .
it' s closed .
and i' ve had a much better idea .
come on .
let' s go and stuff our faces .
oh i could have had my eye out .
where are the glasses ?
damian , wants to give his to the poor .
do you ?
of course they won' t be poor anymore , once you' ve given it to them .
what' il do you do then , take it back ?
speaking of which ...
right mystery activity ... champagne . ... follow me .
a woman opens the door in her nightie and i thought funny place to keep a door ...
this is your fault this .
what is ?
you don' t even know , do you ?
you brought her and you don' t even know .
what are you on about ?
can you hear them laughing ?
even he' s laughing .
listen .
very good .
once she' s got what she came for , she' il piss off again .
then he won' t be laughing will he ?
it will all start again like when mam died .
he' il be angry ...
maybe ... she , you know , she won' t , she' il stay .
oh great !
much better .
is that what you want ?
her in there with him instead of mam ?
why are you angry with me ?
because you did it .
you and your weird stuff .
chucking money away .
talking to yourself .
seeing things .
i don' t .
i mean maybe i do , but ...
and me !
sticking up for you .
for what ?
the truth is , you' re a loony !
don' t say that , anthony .
please don' t say that !
you' re just a fucking loony and you should be locked up .
be at the front door with the money in ten minutes .
damian !
we were ...
i was just ...
dad , don' t answer it .
dad don' t .
what is going on .
please !
see this little girls .
my girls .
these girls santa claus forgot .
you' re our last hope .
we haven' t got a heater home .
because no point going back if you don' t help ... took it out .
just ...
who is it ?
excuse me please .
wheelchair like these need your help .
fifty percent of families with a chronically ill child , break up .
you' re maybe asking yourself why these waterloo station need friends .
oh , let me explain .
this is a mid of night .
this is a privat time .
who are you ?
get out please .
get mind .
just leaving .
go on , you and your ... get out .
come on two euro' s a month ...
it' s absolutely ...
would you be prepared to consider a direct debit .
just shut up , will you ?
damian ?
damian ?
this is that same donkey as he looks after just a few months in our sanctuary .
i think you' il agree ...
all right love .
put him down .
shall we ?
you' d better tell me how this started ?
i' ve no idea .
some one must have said something strange .
digital ?
yeah that' s right , yeah .
how do you find it ?
i' m yet to be convinced .
well you can come and have a look , when you get rid of that lot .
mmm .
one step at a time , eh ?
any chance of a bit of toast ?
you do that , i' il have a look around .
evening , lad .
you .
where is he ?
i don' t know .
ha ?
where is he ?
upstairs .
peaceful isn' t it ?
who are you ?
who am i ?
who are you ?
we' re the police .
oh .
i know you' re only a dream .
but i don' t care .
it' s nice to see you .
even if you' re just a dream .
the money just makes everything worse .
i' ve got something for you .
from readers digest .
here .
you may have already won ten thousand pounds .
please will you talk to me ?
five minutes .
ok ?
now , don' t interrupt .
i' m dead .
i know what i' m talking about , ok ?
you need to use conditioner on your hair .
your dad won' t think of that , but it makes all the difference .
me ?
you are not to worry about me .
you have been worrying about me , haven' t you ?
i' m fine .
anthony .
he seems to have taken it better than you .
but he hasn' t .
he' s got a good heart , he just ... he doesn' t know where it is .
damian ?
he' s going to need you .
be good to him .
dad doesn' t believe .
doesn' t believe what ?
any of it .
anything .
he mustn' t do or he wouldn' t .
couldn' t you talk to him ?
he can' t see me .
oh .
is it because of the money ?
in a way .
the money makes it harder to see what' s what .
you know that already .
never really win with those things anyway .
you just end up with books about the building of the american railways .
it' s her isn' t it ?
your dad and her ?
damian .
you know how complicated the money was ?
well ... people are even more complicated .
you need to remember that there is nearly always enough good around to be going on with .
you' ve just got to have a bit of faith , you know .
and if you' ve got faith in people that makes them stronger .
and you , you' ve got enough to sort all three of you out .
hey ?
that' s why i' m counting on you .
i haven' t really been worried about you .
i' ve just been missing you .
that' s allowed .
are you really a saint ?
well , the criteria' s very strict .
it' s not just a case of doing good and all that .
you do have to do an actual miracle .
so ...
i' m in there .
course i am .
what was your miracle ?
don' t you know ?
it was you .
hey ?
aren' t you going to say goodbye ?
bye .
did you see her ?
what did she say ?
she said to tell you not to worry .
it' s all going to be alright .
she' s looking out for you
come on !
well it was fun while it lasted , eh ?
look there' s no easy way to say this , but i put a bit to one side , for me , to spend .
you can have it back .
dorothy , six thousand , three hundred and ten euros .
all for the best , eh ?
dollars .
it' s just a few grand .
dad ?
ten really .
eleven thousand , four hundred dollars .
i was going to tell you .
i sort of kept them by mistake .
anthony .
i just enjoyed having a wedge .
it wasn' t really the money .
i just liked having it .
four thousand , seven hundred and eighty euros .
dorothy wanted a holiday of a lifetime .
dad wanted to pay off all his credit cards .
come on dad .
anthony wanted one game boy advanced xp .
one play station three .
a shogun new bmx bike .
a rekia five hundred super quad bike .
nimbus two thousand eltro magnetic stair rider .
a table top candy floss maker .
an ipod , obviously .
an ibot obviously .
and a stamp on it hydraulic rocket capable of a attaining altitudes of over one hundred metres .
three ...
two ...
one ...
that' s how anthony would want this story to end .
with big piles of stuff .
but it' s not his story .
it' s mine .
oh , regarde ca .
qu' est ce que c' est ?
this is where i want it to end .
