what' s that ambulance doing there ?
i don' t know .
i' il check it out .
evening , sir .
how' s it going , griff ?
i can' t complain ... and won' t .
is that him ?
yep .
might just be some crackpot but i figured i should call you anyway .
did he ask for me by name ?
nope , asked for the agent in charge of the " god' s hand " case .
said he had some important info on it .
didn' t say what ?
nope .
said he' d only talk to you .
you the agent in charge of the " god' s hand " case ?
that' s right .
wesley doyle .
that a picture of you and your mother , huh ?
i' d appreciate it if you wouldn' t take things off my desk .
sorry about that .
guess i' ve been in here a while .
already had a look at all your plaques and your citations .
didn' t really care to have a look at those .
what can i do for you , mr ... ?
meiks .
my name' s fenton meiks .
now listen , this may sound a little bit crazy but ...
i know who the " god' s hand " killer is .
all right , i' il bite .
who ?
you haven' t even heard me out yet and already you doubt me .
why is that ?
because in a case like this nobody just walks in the office and tells you who the killer is .
it doesn' t happen that way .
sometimes truth defies reason .
yeah ?
so who is it then ?
my brother .
what makes you think that ?
i got a call from him ...
last night .
hello ?
hello ?
demons are taking over the world .
adam ?
i can' t destroy them all .
i can' t take it anymore !
now , let' s talk about this , adam .
but there' s nothing to talk about !
it' s over ... whatever happens , you have to take me to the rose garden .
you promised , remember ?
now , that s just till ...
remember ?
you promised !
meat ?
that' s where all this took place .
it' s about 200 miles west of here , just north of abilene .
why did you go to thurman ?
to bury adam , in the rose garden .
why would you do that ?
i promised him i would .
a long time ago .
that' s a pretty wild story , mr. meiks .
i don' t see what , if anything , this has got to do with my case .
adam is the " god' s hand " killer , agent doyle .
he' s the one you' re looking for .
did he tell you that before he asked you to take him to thurman ?
if that' s the case , you left that part out .
i haven' t finished yet .
oh , there' s more ?
a lot more .
excuse me a minute .
meat sheriff' s office .
can i talk to a sheriff , please ?
this is agent doyle of the fbl .
he' s not in right now .
may i help you ?
well , i' ve got a man here in my office , name of fenton meiks .
fenton meiks ?
what' s he doing there ?
you know him ?
he caused a ruckus here earlier .
he stole an ambulance and his brother' s body too .
did my story check out ?
yeah , it did .
so am i under arrest now ?
you damn sure should be .
the sheriff' s willing to forget it if you bring that ambulance back .
nobody wants to press any charges .
well you gotta love small towns .
why would you go to all that trouble just to walk in here and confess it to me ?
i' m here because i can' t live with what i know anymore .
what exactly do you know ?
that is your mother , isn' t it ?
yeah , it is .
i knew it .
you got the same eyes .
why don t we get back to your story ?
what makes you think that your brother' s the " god' s hand " killer ?
i know it was him .
how do you know ?
it started back in thurman .
it was near the summer of 1979 .
i got the joy , joy , joy , joy down in my heart .
you' re supposed to say , " where ?
i don' t want to sing that dumb song .
you don' t have to sing .
just say " where ?
all right .
where ?
not now .
i' il point to you when it' s time .
i got the joy , joy , joy , joy down in my heart .
where ?
down in my heart .
where ?
down in my heart
i got the joy , joy , joy , joy down in my heart .
and if the devil doesn' t like it he can sit on a tack .
ouch !
sit on a tack .
ouch !
sit on a tack .
and if the devil doesn t like it he can sit on a tack today .
who was that chick that threw up ?
katie hagen .
she' s sure pretty .
it was real messy though .
oh , yeah .
all over the floor !
and when the principal fell ...
i got the joy , joy , joy , joy ...
we lived right behind the thurman public rose garden in the house where they used to keep the gardeners back in the fifties .
dad had gotten a good deal on it back when he and mom got married .
the unexpected incident that creates those dangerous moments .
the ropes were suddenly off the alligator .
adam was 3 years younger than me .
our mom died giving birth to him , so
i basically took care of him ever since i can remember .
our dad worked as a mechanic over in jupiter .
he usually got home around 5 . 30 and we' d all have dinner together .
hey , kiddos .
hey , dad .
something sure smells good .
how was your day ?
it was all right .
let' s eat .
whoa , tiger .
save some for us .
i sure love peas .
you must .
you better be careful , though .
you might turn into one .
how did you do on that math test ?
i barely passed .
well , i was never any good at math either .
shoot , i still can' t do anything without a calculator .
yeah , but there' s going to be another test next week .
and that one' s going to be harder .
hey , don' t sound so glum .
tell you what , we' il sit down this weekend and we' il see if we can' t figure out that junk together , okay ?
all right .
hey , fenton .
can we go see " meatballs " after school tomorrow ?
we' ve already seen it .
i want to see it again .
nah , we' re gonna go see " the warriors .
can' t .
it' s rated r. we' il sneak in .
teeth all brushed ?
you sure about that , adam ?
all right .
breath test time .
dad !
i did
brush them !
i' m just joking with you , egghead !
don t worry , fenton .
i know you' re too big for a goodnight kiss .
sleep tight .
don' t let those bedbugs bite .
that' s right .
love you guys .
love you too , dad .
night , dad .
night , curtis .
i wanna see " meatballs " again .
fine , you can see " meatballs " and i' il see " the warriors .
but i don' t like to watch movies by myself .
too bad .
please ?
all right .
just go to bed .
that was our family .
just the three of us .
all of mom and dad' s relatives had died , so there was no one but us .
we didn t mind though .
we didn' t need anybody else .
we were happy together .
until ...
fenton , wake up .
dad ?
i' ve got something to tell you .
what' s wrong ?
it' s okay .
adam , wake up and listen .
i need you both to listen to me very carefully .
something' s happened .
he said he' d had a vision that night
a vision from god .
an angel came to him and told him the truth of this world and revealed god' s special purpose for our family .
the end of the world is coming .
it' s near .
the angel showed me .
there are demons among us .
the devil has released them for the final battle .
it' s being fought right now .
but nobody knows it except us and others like us .
i' m scared , dad .
there' s nothing to be afraid of .
we' ve been chosen by god .
he will protect us .
he' s given us special jobs to do .
we don' t fear these demons , we destroy them .
we pick them up one by one , and we pitch them out of this world .
that' s god' s purpose for us .
the angel called us " god' s hands .
so we' re like superheroes ?
that' s right .
we' re a family of superheroes that are gonna help save the world .
but , dad , that doesn' t make any sense .
i know it sounds that way , son , but it' s the truth .
so what are our superpowers ?
well ... we can see the demons while other people can' t .
the angel told me god would send us 3 weapons to destroy them with .
magical weapons ?
i imagine so .
when do we get them ?
i don' t know .
the angel just said soon .
that' s all i was told , except we' re not supposed to tell anybody .
absolutely no one .
if we do , we put them and ourselves in danger .
fenton ?
don' t worry , it' s okay .
it' s a lot to understand .
i waited to tell you until i had a chance to figure it out myself .
but the angel said i had to do it now .
fenton ?
i didn t know what to say or how to feel .
do you understand what i told you ?
judgment day is here .
it was too messed up to understand or even acknowledge .
soon we' il all be in heaven .
you , me , adam .
with mommy .
i didn t realize it at the moment , at least not consciously ...
she' s waiting to see us in heaven . but my happy and mostly secure world had just been flipped over .
and there were dark things there .
judgment day is here .
very dark things .
we' ve been chosen by god .
and my little boy' s mind just couldn' t take it .
adam !
fenton !
up and at ' em , boys !
morning , kiddo .
hey , come on ,
lazybones .
it' s late .
we overslept .
let' s go .
snap to it and get dressed .
i gotta get to work .
drop you guys off on the way .
what' s wrong with you ?
nothing .
hey , let me have a bite of that .
none of us mentioned it it was only a dream , a nightmare .
nothing that crazy could be real .
everything was okay , just like before .
have a good day at school , boys .
and remember not to tell anyone .
we won' t , dad .
bye .
okay , now .
i want you all to copy down this sentence .
we' re gonna go through the structure .
the girl in the blue dress ...
i refused to believe it
" walked ...
that next week was a dream too .
her ... brown dog .
like when dad started bringing home the " magical " weapons .
he was on his way to work ... when god called to him .
be careful .
i still can' t understand what these gloves are for though .
just a long , long dream .
i want you to write this down at the top of your pages in big letters .
boys !
boys , look at this .
we got them all .
it won' t be long now .
the angel came again last night and told me that god will be sending us a list of the first 7 demons soon .
it wasn t real .
it couldn' t be .
i just had to wait it out .
come over here a minute , fenton .
i' m washing dishes .
that can wait .
come here .
i want to talk to you .
i know you' ve had some trouble adjusting to everything .
and i' m sorry .
but god has willed this and we must obey god .
maybe you just dreamed it .
i didn' t dream it .
i wouldn' t make up something like that , son .
maybe ...
maybe you' re not right in the head .
it happened , fenton .
it' s true .
you' il see that soon .
that' s what i wanted to talk to you about .
i got the first list .
the angel came to him while he was at work .
dad ,
these are people' s names .
that' s right .
and they' il look like people too .
but they' re not .
the angel said when i lay my hands on them
i' il reveal them for what they truly are .
that' s what the gloves are for .
i get them and bring them back here with the gloves on , and once they' re back here , i take the gloves off and reveal them .
you' il see .
then you' il believe .
does anyone know what this word means ?
do you remember what this word means ?
the dream had finally ended .
it was all real .
and i had to stop him .
the obvious answer was to tell someone what he was planning .
but i couldn' t do that
i loved him even if he had gone crazy .
dad , look , i got a list too .
where did you get this , adam ?
god gave it to me .
isn' t travis shed that boy that was picking on you at school last week ?
he' s a demon .
tell the truth , adam .
you made this list up yourself , didn' t you ?
no , god did .
adam ?
come on , right here .
now , listen to me , son .
you can' t make stuff like that up .
we destroy demons .
if we were to use your list , we' d be killing people .
and we can never do that .
now , destroying demons is a good thing .
killing people is bad .
you understand ?
i' m sorry , dad .
that' s all right .
it' s okay .
you just got to have a little patience .
don' t worry .
god will send you your own list when you' re older .
okay .
go do some homework .
the only thing left to do was to tell .
that was easier said than done .
dad had promised to take us to the movies that night , but he didn' t come home from work .
when' s dad coming home ?
i don' t know .
think he' s destroying a demon ?
it' s all make believe , adam .
no , it' s not .
it' s true .
listen to me .
none of that demon junk is real .
daddy just made it up .
no , he didn' t .
he did too .
just like santa claus .
you remember when you caught dad putting our presents under the tree ?
it' s just like that .
adam , have i ever lied to you ?
all right , look .
dad made up this whole thing .
the names on his list are real people .
do you understand ?
but why would he make it up ?
i don' t know .
but i think we should leave .
you mean ... run away ?
will you go with me ?
only for
a little while .
i don' t want to leave dad .
neither do i.
but we might have to .
why ?
dad' s gonna kill somebody .
son , come over here .
come on , i need your help .
dad ?
come on out here , adam .
shine that light over here .
hey , dad , who is that ?
that' s a demon , son .
come on in here , boys .
it' s all right .
go on , don' t be afraid .
god came to him earlier that day and told him that the time had come .
after work he drove down to jacksonville , about 45 minutes or so southwest of thurman .
he said he d never been there before but he had no problem finding it
god was leading him .
cynthia harbridge ?
yes ?
dad , don' t .
please don' t .
fenton , if i could spare you this , i would .
but we are god' s servants and his will must be served .
don' t be afraid , son .
is that true ?
why would i make it up ?
where' s your father now ?
dead .
sir , i was thinking about heading out .
unless you need me to stay .
no .
that' s all right .
you go ahead .
have a good night , sir .
so he killed that woman right there in front of you ?
but not to his way of thinking .
you see , to him he hadn' t killed a woman , he' d destroyed a demon .
he believed that when he laid his hands on her , it revealed her sins .
dad , don' t !
please !
no , adam .
do it like this .
it' s gotta be done in a certain way .
the angel was real specific .
why out here in the rose garden ?
god chose it .
just like he chose us , i suppose .
don' t cry for her , fenton .
she wasn' t human .
didn' t you see when i touched her ?
i saw it , dad .
you killed her .
i didn' t kill her , son .
i destroyed her .
she was a demon .
you know , i wasn' t so sure i could do it myself .
i mean , she looked like a woman to me too .
but after i touched her , all i could see was the evil .
and i had to do it .
i' m sorry you didn' t see it too .
you will next time .
you ... you' re gonna do it again ?
this is our job now , son .
you' ve got to accept that .
i won' t let you .
we are doing god' s work here .
i' il tell .
if you do , someone will die .
the angel was clear on that .
do you understand ?
answer me , fenton .
do you understand ?
so you didn' t tell ?
no .
i should have , but i was afraid .
i mean , i loved my father , but i was terrified of him .
so now you understand why i know my brother is the " god' s hand " killer ?
have you got any physical proof ?
i read in the paper that only one of the bodies of the 6 victims had been found .
is it true ?
you read it in the papers , didn' t you ?
it doesn' t necessarily mean it' s true .
well , in this case it does .
see , the first victim was found mutilated with a note saying that god' s hand had taken him .
all the rest , only notes were found .
no bodies .
how do you know they' re dead ?
oh , we don' t for sure .
but the first note said we wouldn' t find any more bodies from then on .
said he wanted to keep them .
i got a pretty good idea where the rest of them bodies are .
the rose garden ?
now why didn' t you tell me that in the first place ?
would you have believed me ?
come on .
here .
what' s this ?
put them on .
or i' il put them on for you .
let' s go .
so tell me something .
why didn' t you come see me sooner ?
you' re gonna wanna get on 30 east up here .
i can' t imagine how you can keep something like that inside so long .
i guess i avoided it because i wanted to .
you never did tell me why it is you just keep one picture of your mother in your office .
my mother was murdered a couple days after that picture was taken .
butchered by some whacked out killer like your dad .
did they ever catch him ?
no .
is that why you took this job ?
you' re pretty good at this .
you ever think about becoming a cop ?
well , you know , when i was a kid .
well , you got the instincts for it .
a cop' s gotta have good instincts .
you know what mine are telling me now ?
you' re hiding something from me .
what is it you think i' m hiding ?
why don' t you just keep talking ?
maybe i' il figure it out .
you okay , dad ?
i' m all right son .
here i come .
dad , why did god let this happen to me ?
don t blame god , davy .
it wasn t his fault .
god let me do it .
what god lets you do is decide for yourself what you will do .
you' re not puppet with strings .
# no . #
so god doesn t make you do anything .
he wants you to decide for yourself .
after that night nothing much happened .
dad didn' t mention it anymore .
neither did adam .
once a full month had gone by , i' d completely convinced myself it was over and everything was gonna be all right
bye .
see you all later .
did you see " dukes of hazard " last night ?
remember when daisy duke bent over ?
i like boss hogg .
he' s funny .
man , i' d do anything to really see her tits .
ahhh ... you said " tits .
shut up , adam .
you wanna spend the night tonight ?
we can wrap corey' s house .
i' il have to ask dad though .
my mom can ask if you want .
sure .
i' il see you in a little bit .
bye .
hey , what' s " wrap " mean ?
tell you later .
come on , i' il race you .
come on !
no , i' m gonna go round on the road .
dad ?
in here .
whose van is that out there ?
ours .
ain' t she a beauty ?
you friend' s mom just called .
i told her not tonight .
we got some work to do in the morning .
dad told us that there were moments when people could just disappear without anyone knowing where they went or why .
he said those were the moments when god' s hands could take you .
according to dad , nothing , not even a camera , could catch us .
we were invisible when we were god' s hands .
what do we do now , dad ?
we' il get him when he comes out just like i told you , remember ?
fenton ?
i can' t do this , dad .
" can' t " never could do anything .
i can do it , dad .
you sure can , tiger .
well , what if someone sees us ?
they won' t .
it' s broad daylight .
god will blind them for us .
there he is , boys .
come on , fenton .
dad , i can' t .
yes , you can .
now move .
do what i tell you !
please , trixie !
trixie , come on !
come , trixie !
trixie , come on !
what you doing , boy ?
my dog ... she' s under your car .
oh , well , let' s see .
help me grab his legs .
help me grab his legs now !
come on !
edward march .
you think that' s an innocent man there , don' t you ?
well , it' s not .
you didn' t think anyone knew about that , did you ?
but god saw you .
dad , don' t !
please !
quiet !
and you can' t escape god' s wrath !
can' t believe you still didn' t see it .
he was the murderer of little children , fenton .
babies .
babies .
he' s the murderer .
we gotta get out of here , adam .
what do you mean ?
gotta run away .
told you we might have to .
i don' t wanna run away .
we have to .
why ?
listen to me , adam .
dad kills people .
no , he doesn' t .
he' s a demon slayer .
that' s all lies , adam .
no , it' s not .
i see it when he touches them .
no , you don' t .
dad' s brainwashed you .
it' s all a big lie .
he' s a murderer and you help him .
no !
we re just serving god' s will .
i' m telling dad on you !
adam !
adam !
adam !
get up and get dressed .
and don t wake your brother .
sit down .
your brother told me what you said last night .
i want you to know i' ve never killed anything in my whole life .
that' s a lie and you know it .
i did a lot of thinking and praying after you went to bed .
i asked the angel to visit you .
but instead he visited me .
and he told me something ...
i don t want to believe .
what ?
it doesn' t matter .
because together you and i are gonna prove him wrong .
you just don' t have any faith .
that' s why you can' t see the truth .
but we' re gonna change that .
i want you to dig a hole right here .
need to be about 10 feet deep and 15 feet wide on both sides .
the length and the width should form a perfect square .
what ?
you heard me .
why ?
because i' m your father and you' il do what i tell you .
understand ?
do you ?
yes , sir .
all right .
i expect half that to be dug by the time i get home tonight .
dad , i can' t do that .
pray !
i started digging that goddamn hole , but i did not pray .
i would not .
i hated god , i despised him .
my hatred helped me dig , kept me going .
dad' s or god s or whoever s plan it was , it would not work on me .
i knew what dad was doing was wrong , and nothing was gonna change that
fenton ?
sorry i told on you .
you tell him about running away ?
no .
will you go with me then ?
there' s no reason to go .
he' s a killer .
no , he' s not .
i' ve been praying for you .
have you been praying ?
nope , and i' m not going to !
but dad said ...
i don' t care what dad said !
he might be able to make me dig this hole but he can' t make me pray .
just get out of here and leave me alone .
i' il help you if you promise you won' t tell dad .
i don' t want your help .
but there' s another
shovel in the shed .
get out of here !
butt hole !
i wanted to run away ... faraway , but
i still couldn' t leave adam , no matter how crazy dad was turning .
besides , there was nowhere to go .
finally gave up , huh , kiddo ?
i' il be there again in the morning .
come on , i didn' t mean it like that .
i don' t want to fight with you , son .
i' m not doing this to hurt you .
wish you could understand that .
what' s the matter with you ?
nothing .
let me see your hands .
they' re fine .
let me see them .
didn' t you wear gloves today ?
i didn' t need them .
i' m fine .
here .
help ease the pain .
i said i was fine .
i know you' re mad at me but that' s no reason to cause yourself pain .
i got an extra pair of work gloves in the shed .
i want you to use these from now on .
it won' t do you any good now that you' ve wrecked your hands , but a couple of days and you' il be fine .
i want you to know i' m proud of you .
and i know god' s proud of you too .
take some time off and let those blisters callous over .
then you can get back to it , all right ?
well , good night then .
come on , tiger .
bedtime .
fenton gets to stay up .
please , dad ?
come on .
brush your teeth .
i' il be in to say goodnight in a minute .
i kept digging .
my hands bled , but i wouldn' t stop .
i kept at it morning , noon and night for 5 days .
and by the sixth day , that hole was as dark as my hatred for dad' s god .
well , you finished it all right .
betcha you didn' t pray once the whole time , did you ?
nope .
we started the cellar after that .
at least that' s what dad called it .
but i knew better .
we were building a dungeon down there .
we basically built a big wooden box in the ground .
good , boys .
get it over there .
cover it good .
dad said it would hold .
he said god would see to it
get back here and help me push !
come on .
keep it going !
push it !
go !
go !
keep it moving !
keep it moving !
you boys did good .
especially you , fenton .
no .
i just did as i was told .
well , what do you think ?
all right .
the next night he brought home another demon .
get down there .
it has to be done .
it' s god' s will .
come on , do it like i showed you ... the neck first , fenton !
fenton , get back here !
boy !
fenton !
i half expected angels or god to come out of the night and stop me .
but i had to do it .
it had to end .
hello ?
1034 to any and all units in the vicinity of garden .
we have complaints of a 501 driving on the alternate side of the street
hello ?
hello ?
take it easy , boys .
don' t break my door down .
well , what' s your problem ?
craziest thing i' ve heard in a long time .
what are you doing ?
calling your dad .
you can' t .
yes , i can .
you ought to be ashamed
making up stories like that .
but , it' s true !
i can show you !
come on .
let' s go .
it' s around back , under the shed .
that' s enough of that now , boy .
i' il put an end to this .
come on .
no ... he' s around back .
see what your dad' s got to say about all this .
what' s the trouble , sheriff ?
sorry to wake you , but your boy here seems to have a problem .
come on in .
i was about to head over to lake thompson , to get a jump on the bass .
and he comes running in with this wild story .
yep .
it' s quite a tale all right .
it' s the truth and you know it .
it makes me mad to think that he told everyone down at your office too .
you can set your mind at ease about that .
i was the only one there .
course , i don' t believe a word of it .
what does get me , though , is why would he make up such a crazy story ?
i don' t know why he made it up .
probably did it to get back at me for punishing him earlier .
did you tell him about that ?
he' s lying .
just check the shed .
i don' t know what to do with him .
well , they hit puberty , seem to lose all respect for you .
me and my boys survived it .
you will too .
just check the shed or the rose garden .
i could show you where
they' re buried .
why don' t you just quit all this ?
please , i can show you .
maybe we ought to check the shed just to quiet him down .
well , if it has to be done , it has to be done .
what do you think , kiddo ?
does it have to be done ?
see ?
i figured we ought to have a storm cellar .
go on down and check it out .
just watch your step .
i' m not much of a carpenter .
i don' t see a thing .
he was here .
you realize the trouble you could get into over a thing like this ?
they must have moved him because he was here .
adam .
adam' s got him somewhere , i know it .
i think i' ve seen enough .
but ...
i could show you where the bodies are buried .
please !
you gotta believe me !
may god welcome you and keep you .
i never killed a man before tonight .
i' ve seen you kill plenty .
those were demons .
that was a man .
why can' t you see that ?
you didn' t have to kill him .
i had to protect our mission .
there is no mission !
that man is dead because of you .
you see him ?
look at him !
he' s dead because you have no faith .
do you understand what you made me do ?
you made me commit murder !
i didn' t make you do anything !
you did !
you' re crazy !
shut up !
you' re scared !
dad , no !
dad , don' t !
i ...
i can' t .
it' s all right , dad .
don' t cry .
wait a minute , fenton .
go on inside , son .
i' il be there in a minute to tuck you in .
go on , it' s all right .
go .
come into the shed .
come in and shut the door .
are you afraid ?
of what ?
you .
only demons should fear me .
and you' re not a demon , are you ?
the angel said you were .
but i can' t believe that .
i won' t .
you' re my son .
and i love you more than my own life .
you know what s funny about all this , fenton ?
i' m afraid of you .
go on .
but , dad .
i don' t want to do this , fenton , but i have to .
i had to kill a man tonight .
i can' t let that happen again .
but , dad , i promise i won' t tell .
i can' t trust you .
i wish i could .
now go on .
but , dad , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry too but this has to be done .
now you get on down there or i' il put you down there myself .
but , dad ...
go !
no !
no !
no !
dad , please !
dad !
dad !

i' m not a demon !
please !
please , please !

fenton ?
fenton !
fenton , you all right ?
adam ?
adam , is that you ?
adam ?
adam , you gotta get me out of here .
i can' t .
but i' m hungry and i gotta go to the bathroom .
dad won' t let me feed you .
i brought you some water though .
he says you can have a cup a day .
but i' il bring you more if i can .
look , adam , he' s gonna kill me .
you gotta get me out of here .
i can' t .
put your mouth to the knothole right here .
you ready ?
here .
you want some more or you want me to save it
for later ?
more !
more !
you' ve gotta get me out of here .
dad says you' il probably be out of there by the end of the week .
you just have to accept god' s will .
a week ?
i can' t stay
in here that long .
i' il pray for you .
adam ?
adam ?
adam ?
the days came and went .
i counted them by the light through the hatch door and adam' s visits .
i only slept when i passed out from exhaustion .
what about your dad ?
didn' t he ever come back to at least check on you ?
on the seventh day .
has god spoken to you yet ?
there is no god .
i lost count of the days after that .
it felt like weeks .
i finally went beyond fear into total insanity .
i saw god .
he had finally sent me a vision .
it was then that i understood my destiny just like dad said i would .
dad !
fenton' s not answering !
fenton ?
fenton ?
fenton !
fenton .
what ?
come on , kiddo .
give me that water .
easy , boy .
easy .
easy .
here you go , kiddo .
here you go , buddy .
dad ?
i saw god !
just try to take a little sip .
slow down there .
don' t want to eat too fast , you' il make yourself sick .
so did god tell you about the demons ?
sorry i ever doubted you .
i' m sorry too , son .
what did god look like ?
kind of hard to describe .
was he big ?
adam ,
let your brother eat in peace .
he can' t explain something
like that .
but i want to know .
then maybe you should pray for it .
it' s not fair .
all i' ve ever seen are demons , and he gets to see god .
that' s right .
but look at the price he paid .
that' s all behind us now .
it' s a new day .
isn' t it , fenton ?
so we gonna go get us a demon now ?
after a while .
when fenton' s ready .
a week later i was ready .
my first demon was to be brad white from dallas .
there it is .
i see it .
you' re sure you' re ready for this ?
yes , sir .
i bought these for you .
you' il need them now that god has spoken to you .
all right , let' s go .
i want to go too , dad .
not this time , adam .
you stay here and keep your eyes peeled .
don' t worry .
your time will come .
let' s go .
sorry to bother you but ...
yeah ?
my mom and i , we got a flat on our van .
yeah .
well , i was wondering if you had a tire iron .
we went off and left ours at home .
hey , pal , what' s with the gloves ?
oh , to change the tire .
don' t want to get your hands dirty ?
yeah .
brad , who is it ?
mind your business , you fucking bitch !
goddamn women .
yeah , i think i got one for you .
out back .
great .
back here .
let' s see .
here it is .
shit !
grab his legs .
brad white ?
you know , fenton ,
i' ve been waiting for this moment ever since all this started .
i' m ready to fulfill my destiny .
i' m proud of you , son .
fuck you !
you fuck !
get your fucking hands away !
get the fuck off !
destroy him !
dad !
dad , no , no , no !
no !
i buried him in the rose garden .
we went to the sheriff' s office a week later and told them that dad just didn' t come home one day .
they filed a missing persons but they didn' t find anything .
after awhile they sent us to separate orphanages .
so , nobody ever knew about any of this ?
no .
not until now .
what about adam ?
he didn' t tell anybody ?
mind if we just sit here ?
i don' t much feel like talking anymore .
tell me more about that promise you made to your brother .
it was later on that night .
adam ?
if you ever destroy me , promise me you' il bury me here .
i promise to god i' il bury you here .
i don' t get it .
he promised you that he' d bury you here ?
yeah .
if he killed you .
no , not killed .
destroyed .
don' t make any sense .
yes , it does .
if that man standing in front of you is adam meiks .
so you killed all those people .
no .
no , i told you before , i' ve never killed anyone in my life .
fenton was the killer .
just stop the bullshit and tell me the truth .
you' il understand soon .
just let me show you where i buried fenton .
hold it .
you take it real slow .
that' s it .
this is the spot .
there' s too many graves here .
there' s only six victims .
fenton didn' t bury his victims here .
he kept them as trophies in his basement .
this is where i put demons .
you thought your brother was a demon ?
he was .
that' s why he couldn' t see the truth .
dad knew it too .
he just couldn' t accept it .
you see , god asked dad to destroy his son , much like he asked abraham to sacrifice his son isaac .
but dad couldn' t do it .
and god didn' t take pity on dad like he did abraham .
so he handed down the duty to me .
fenton knew i' d come .
that' s why he left those notes to lure me in .
i guess he figured when the killings made the news that i' d come for him .
but i had to wait till god put him on my list
to come before that would have been murder .
adam ?
jesus christ , you really do believe all this stuff .
i' ve always believed .
that' s all lies , adam .
no , it' s not .
i see it when he touches them .
you re just crazy as hell .
fenton or adam or whatever your damn name is .
i don' t really give a fuck .
all i need to know right now is you' re a murdering son of a bitch .
and i got you .
maybe .
but that' s not gonna bring your mother back , is it ?
she' s dead and her killer got away , didn' t he ?
goddamn you .
dirty little son of a ...
how did you know ?
you were on my list .
you didn' t think anybody knew about that , did you ?
god knew .
that' s why he sent me .
i' m an fbi agent .
they' il come looking for me .
no , they won' t .
they' il keep looking for fenton .
you' re going to be his last victim .
they' ve seen you .
they' il know it was you .
god will protect me .
i can' t talk right now , i can' t .
i' il get back to you .
here .
thank you .
are you sure neither one of you can remember what he looks like ?
look , i told you it s just a blur .
i can' t understand it .
i looked right at him .
i shook his hand .
dave , we' ve got a problem .
you' ve got to take a look at this .
there he is .
we got you now , buddy .
what is this ?
all the tapes look like this .
goddamn it !
we' re running the name he gave you .
it' s got to be a fake name .
sounds fake .
fenton meiks .
fenton meiks , this is the fbl !
we' re coming in !
go !
go !
clear !
anything ?
no .
all right , let' s dust it .
oh , my god .
there' s no one here , sir .
we found this in the basement .
is he down there too ?
not him .
1034 , possible 1070 ...
excuse me .
didn' t hear you come in .
how can i help you ?
i' m with the fbl .
i need to speak to the sheriff .
is he in ?
sure thing .
sheriff ?
would you like some coffee ?
no , i' m fine , thanks .
well , hey , curtis .
afternoon , becky .
sheriff ?
yeah .
i' m agent griffin hull of the fbl .
i need to ask you some questions about your brother .
fenton ?
yes , sir .
why don' t you come on around back ?
well , i appreciate you coming by to tell me personally .
i just wanted you to know before we go public .
well , listen , if there' s anything i can do , don' t hesitate to call .
i think we got it pretty well covered from here .
but again , if you can think of anything , or if he contacts you ...
of course .
all right .
you' re a good man , agent hull .
everything okay , adam ?
everything' s just fine , becky .
god' s will has been served .
praise god .
