in that small cafe
the park across the way
the children' s carousel
the chestnut trees ...
southern summers are indifferent to the trials of young love .
the wishing well armed with warnings and doubts ,
noah and allie gave a remarkably convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl traveling down a very long road with no regard for the consequences .
they fell in love , didn' t they ?
yes , they did .
good .
i like this kind of story .
go on .
after that night ,
allie and noah spent every waking hour together .
and soon they were inseparable .
noah , come on .
your boat cannot beat me there .
that' s really nice .
mmm , mmm , mmm ...
beautiful dripping fragments .
the negligent list of one after another , as i happen to call them to me .
or drink to them .
the real poems , what we call poems , being merely pictures .
the poems of the privacy of the night .
and of men like me .
this poem , drooping shy and unseen , that i always carry .
and that all men carry .
not bad for whitman .
hey , look , we got a visitor .
i' m sorry , i didn' t mean to interrupt .
well , don' t apologize , come on up here , darling .
we could use a little something here besides the smell of lumber .

dad ...
so ... well , you did .
i didn' t know that .
god .
i stammered .
stammered , stutter , what' s the difference ?
couldn' t understand a damn thing he said .
so , i got him to read me poetry out loud .
it wasn' t very pretty at first , but then his stutter went away .
well , it' s a good idea , that poetry .
yeah , i thought so .
huh ?
unbelievable , unbelievable .
i' m a tennyson man , myself , but he likes whitman ...
for some reason , i don' t know .

they didn' t agree on much .
in fact , they rarely agreed on everything .
they fought all the time .
don' t kick me !

and they challenged each other every day .
but despite their differences , they had one important thing in common .
they were crazy about each other .

summer' s over and it' s time to go home .
if he wants to talk to you , he' il write .
if not ?
okay .
okay , can you just ... can you just tell him that i love him , then ?
can you do that ?
i' il tell him .
thank you .
bye , fin .
she' s gone .
summer romances end for all kinds of reasons .
they are shooting stars ... a spectacular moment of light in the heavens , a fleeting glimpse of eternity .
and in a flash , they' re gone .
noah was desperate .
he wrote to allie that he was sorry and stupid for breaking up with her .
he wrote to tell her that he still loved her , and he wanted to see her .
and that if she would write back , he would come to wherever she was .
he wrote one letter a day for a year ... 365 letters , but they all went unanswered .
hey fred !
nothing ?
sorry .
all right , thank you .
finally , after a year of silence , he decided to put it all behind him and start a new life .
so he wrote a farewell letter
and he and fin packed their bags and headed for atlanta .
noah !
noah !
noah !
come on , listen to this !
a state of war has existed between the united states and the ...
the constitution of the united states , against all enemies , foreign and domestic .
noah and fin enlisted together .
and after two years of chasing rommel through the north african desert , they were deployed to patton' s third army in europe .
go !
fin !
do i contradict myself ?
very well then , i contradict myself .
allie was in her third year of college when she volunteered as a nurse' s aid .
to her , the broken men with shattered bodies , who filled the ward were all noah .
or someone who fought beside him in the jungle or frozen snow swept road .
i' m gonna lift you up .
ready ?
there we go .
now , i' m gonna bring this leg over .
set it on the stool .
all right .
you okay ?
yeah .
miss , can i ask you a question ?
hmm ?
i noticed that you aren' t wearing a ring .
and i was wondering if i could take you out .
excuse me ?
on a date .
now , before you go and say no ,
i' il have you know that i am an excellent dancer and my intentions are completely dishonorable .
okay , okay " casanova , " come on .
let' s just get you better , then we' il talk about a date , okay ?
would you get a load of him ?
oh my gosh , he is dreamy .
what is he doing here ?
mmm .
he' s staring at you .
oh , miss ?
i' m all better .
now , how' s about that date ?
allie was surprised how quickly she fell in love with lon hammond .
he was handsome , smart , funny , sophisticated and charming .
hey !
he also came from old southern money , and was fabulously wealthy .
what ?
hya !
oh , what' s happening ?
where you going ?
where they going ?
see you later , sweetheart .
oh dear , look at that .
allie , i' ve been thinking a lot about why we shouldn' t get married .
okay , i give up , why shouldn' t we get married ?
well see , that' s the thing , i couldn' t think of anything at first .
an then , it just dawned on me .
your parents ...
my parents ?
absolutely .
your old mom and dad .
thank you for that .
mom ?
you see , the problem is that they love me .
i' m exactly the type of man they do .
they want you to end up with .
really ?
you know , i' m wealthy , i' m from the south , i got a decent job .
you know , i' m an incredible dancer , i' m a really smart guy .
you look great .
i like to think ...
so what' s the problem , huh ?
now just this , if you marry me ...
mm hmm .
now listen close .
if you marry me ...
mm hmm .
then you will have lost a life long battle of defiance against them .
oh my goodness , what are we going to do ?
i do not know .
huh !
hey , band , you feeling all right ?
hey , band , you feeling all right ? !
ooh bop sha bam , shi bimmy bop
oh bop sha bam , shi bimmy bop you say it !
ally ally ally ooh ally ally ally ooh
olly olly olly ooh olly olly olly ooh
whooly ooh whooly ooh
whooly ooh whooly ooh
see allie , i think ... damn it , i think you have to marry me .
i think you need to marry me .
i do ?
yes you do .
i do , why ?
because if you do , you parents will always know the unhappiness that you feel for not being able to disappoint them .
i think you may have overlooked one minor detail .
and what' s that ?
well , you see you have to get their permission first .
and i think you may have overestimated their affection for you .
is that right ?
mm hmm .
oh , i don' t think so .
then why not ?
oh , ' cause i asked them already and they said yes .
what ?
one more thing .
i love you .
will you marry me , honey ?
i know i kid around a lot , but i' m crazy about you .
marry me ?
make me the happiest man in the world .
yes .
yes !
just hold tight .
where are you going ?
oh my god .
mama .
okay , stop the band .
excuse me .
i' d like everyone here to know that this young lady and i are getting married .
she agreed with all her heart , but couldn' t understand why at the very moment she said yes ,
noah' s face came to her mind .
hey , noah , yeah !
oh , good to see you .
let me see you .
you bleeding anywhere ?
no ?
everything good ?
yeah .
oh , i love you .
come on , there' s something i got to show you .
come on .
all right .
what' s going on ?
what is this ?
here .
i sold the house .
you sold the house ?
yup .
gotta be out by the end of the month .
between that and your gi bill , you ought to be able to get it now .
get what ?
your dream house .
the windsor plantation .
dad ...
now , don' t dad me , i don' t want to hear about it .
i already talked to the bank , they' re gonna give you the loan .
well , i can' t let you sell your house .
it' s done .
it' s a good thing .
you should do it .
wait a second .
you sell the house , where are you gonna live ?
with you , dummy , what do you think ?
somebody' s got to help you fix it up .
noah took a look at the house , but only saw one thing ...
allie .
he decided right there to fulfill his life long dream .
he would rebuild the old house from the ground up .
and when noah went to charleston to get the building plans approved , fate stepped in and dealt him a sweet card .
stop the bus !
stop the bus .
sorry , mac , i can' t stop the bus until i get to the depot .
no , no , no , please stop the bus now .
please !
do you understand english , pal ?
no one gets off till we get to the depot .
now sit down .
god .
hey !
watch it , screwball !
what are you doing ?
hey !
how old is your daughter now ?
well , you mind .
he' s right over there .
baby , hello .
oh !
hold it .
oh , come with it .
after seeing allie that day , something inside noah snapped .
he got the notion into his head that if he restored the old house where they had come that night ,
allie would find a way to come back to him .
some called it a labor of love .
others called it something else .
but in fact , noah had gone a little mad .
excuse me .
would ...
it' s time to eat .
lunch will be served in the sun room today .
the melon is good .
i had a bite .
did they ever see each other again ?
noah and allie ?
now you don' t want me to spoil the end of the story before i get to the good part , do you ?
where did i leave off ?
i shall not want .
when noah' s father died in november , the house was all he had .
he leadeth me down ...
in time , noah finished the house .
okay , smile .
here we go .
he took a good look at what he had accomplished , got rip roaring drunk for 10 days , thought seriously about setting it on fire , then finally put the house up for sale .
i' m prepared to offer you this much .
he had a number of interested buyers , but he always found a reason not to sell it to them .
no .
either the bids were too low , or if they met his asking price , he felt it was worth a lot more .
it' s a lot of money , but i' il take it .
$50, 000 .
that' s more than my asking price .
that' s right .
it' s a great deal more .
he told the man that offered him $5, 000 over his price that no one in his right mind would do that and he wouldn' t have a lunatic living in his house .
he worked out his frustration with life on the creek every morning .
and in the evenings , to temper the sting of loneliness , there was martha shaw .
martha was a war widow who lived in quail ridge , a town away .
so you want to go out tomorrow ?
i got to work .
well , we could down to the river if you want to .
next week , sometime .
maybe we could take a drive somewhere ?
no .
well , i' m just asking you .
what do you want , noah ?
what do you mean , what do i want ?
from me .
sometimes when you talk to me , you don' t even see me .
look , a woman knows when a man looks into her eyes and sees someone else .
now you know i want to give you all the things that you want , right ?
but i can' t , because they' re gone ...
they' re broken .
all right ?
is the veil too much ?
are you kidding ?
you look perfect !
you' re the most beautiful bride .
you look gorgeous , honey .
thank you .
wait until lon sees you in this dress , he' s gonna go crazy .
he won' t be able to take his eyes off you , or his hands .
oh , you' re bad !
have you seen this morning' s paper ?
the " daily journal " says that you are going to be
the social highlight of the season .
of the season ?
this is gonna be a celebration the likes of which this town' s never seen !
she doesn' t plan , she plots , doesn' t she ?
mama , look , the governor' s coming .
he better .
let me see .
oh , boy .
all right savannah , where are we at ?
we' re 82 now .
memphis , where are at ?
we' re 89 now .
89 , great , up from 85 .
sir ?
yes .
you have a visitor .
well , hello .
baby , i didn' t know you were coming .
i' m ...
i' m so sorry , i should have called .

you don' t have to call .
guys , could you give us a minute ?
all right .
yes , sir .
miss allie .

is everything okay ?
i need to get away .
okay .
i need to take care of a few things .
i need to clear my head .
okay , should i be worried ?
no , i don' t think so .
oh , that' s reassuring .
listen , are you all right ?
yeah .
okay , then go .
take your time , do whatever you need to do .
it' s okay to be nervous , all right ?
it' s normal to get cold feet before your wedding .
no , no second thoughts , huh uh .
i love you .
i' m going to be back from seabrook in a couple of days , okay ?
seabrook ?
yeah , seabrook .
hello .
i saw your picture in the paper , the one with you and the house .
and i just wanted to come and see if you were okay .
i mean , i wasn' t in the neighborhood or anything .
i just ...
so are you okay ?
okay , good .
i' m a stupid woman , i shouldn' t have come .
you want to come in ?
okay .
this is a good story .
i' m glad you like it .
i think i' ve heard it before .
yes .
perhaps more than once ?
doctor needs to see you .
me ?
now ?
no , him .
but he hasn' t finished reading his story .
i' il read some more when i' m through with the doctor .
this shouldn' t take too long .
all right .
don' t you go away .
i' il be right back .
while you waiting , maybe you' d like to play the piano for a few minutes .
you do like that .
i do ?
mm hmm .
i don' t know any tunes .
you can read music .
no kidding ?
mm hmm .
who are you ?
i' m dr. barnwell , one of the new attending physicians .
we haven' t met , so i thought i' d examine you myself .
okay , so i see here that you' ve had two heart attacks over the last 18 months .
yeah , minor ones , i think one was angina .
okay , any complications ?
nope , feel fine .
okay , deep breath for me .
okay , one more time .
and deep breath .
and one more .
terrific , terrific .
you still taking your medication ?
every day , twice a day .
good , good , good , good , good .
okay , you can put your shirt on .
so i understand that you read to miss hamilton .
yeah , to help her remember .
hmm .
you don' t think it' il help ?
no , i don' t .
she remembers , doc .
i read to her and she remembers .
not always , but she remembers .
but senile dementia is irreversible .
it' s degenerative .
after a certain point , its victims don' t come back .
yeah , that' s what they keep telling me .
well , i just don' t want you to get your hopes up .
well , thanks , doc , but you know what they say ?
science goes only so far and then comes god .
then comes god .
damn , i forgot to turn the page for her .
you through with me ?
i guess they flipped that page .
no , that she' s playing by memory .
his name is lon hammond , jr .
hammond ?
as in hammond cotton ?
as in hammond cotton .
well , your parents must love him .
he' s a really good man , noah .

well , you go slow then , i don' t want to have to take advantage of you .
you wouldn' t dare .

why are you looking at me like that ?
just memories .
this room .
this ... is this where we ...
this is the room ?
huh ...
i' m full .
me too .
oh how your fingers drowse me .
your breath falls around me like dew .
your pulse lulls the tympans of my ears .
i feel a merge from head to foot .
delicious enough .
it was real , wasn' t it ?
you and me .
such a long time ago , we were just a couple of kids .
but we really loved each other , didn' t we ?
i should go .
goodbye .
do you think you could back tomorrow morning ?
there' s some place i' d like to show you .
please .
okay .
okay .
she had come back into his life
like a sudden flame , blazing and streaming into his heart .
noah stayed up all night contemplating the certain agony he knew would be his , if he were to lose her twice .
oh , i do wish i could figure out the end of this story .
the children are here .
children ?
not yours , his .
oh ...

she' s sensational .

i' m really glad that i came , noah .
i' d forgotten what it' s like .
for the first time since i lost richard ,
i feel like i' ve got something to look forward to .
mmm ...
lon is on his way here .
i' m afraid your father spilled the beans about noah , and when lon didn' t hear from you again last night , he decided to come .
well , that' s great .
that' s just terrific .
you , me , noah and lon , one big happy family .
tell me about the letters , mother .
is it true ?
yes .
you watched me cry myself to sleep for months and months and you never said anything .
how could you do that ?
i' m sorry .
you' re sorry ?
you' re sorry ?
yes , i am ...
i am sorry .
because of you , my entire life is ruined !
okay , yes , i stole your letters .
it was wrong , but stop being dramatic and at least take some of the responsibility .
you came down here .
you knew what you were doing .
you knew this would happen .
oh , so now i' m a tramp ?
you are unbelievable .
unbelievable .
go on and get some clothes on .
let' s take a drive .
let' s take a drive ?
why would i want to go anywhere with you ?
because i might know you a little better than you think .
and i don' t want you waking up one morning thinking that if you' d known everything , you might have done something different .
what are we doing here , mama ?
do you see that man , there ?
mm hmm .
don' t look like it now , but 25 years ago ... oh my goodness , he was really something .
we were out of our minds in love , let me tell you .
wow .
well , naturally , your grandfather was furious , so ... we decided to run away .
we didn' t even make the next town before the police picked us up .
but that was then .
you know sometimes when i' m in the area ,
i just stop here and i watch him , trying to picture how different my life might have been .
i want you to know that i love your father .
mama , i' m ...
no , goddamn it , this is important and you need to hear it .
i do .
he is a wonderful man .
he is good to me and i don' t deserve him .
i love him , allie , i do , i love him .
i know .
oh , god .
oh , this is just very embarrassing .
oh , i' m a stupid woman .
look at me , the big old bawl bag .
it' s crazy .
i don' t even know who that person is .
oh , boy .
okay .
allie !
here .
i hope you make the right choice .
interesting morning ?
yeah .
lon' s here in town .
he' s here ?
yeah , we saw his car on the way , at the hotel .
huh .
i see you got my letters .
finally .
what are you going to do , al ?
i don' t know .
we' re back to that ?
are we back there ?
what about the past couple of days ?
they happened , you know ?
i know that they happened , and they were wonderful , but they were also very irresponsible .
i have a fiance waiting for me at a hotel , who' s going to be crushed
when he finds out .
so you make love to me and then you go back to your husband ?
was that your plan ?
was that a test that i didn' t pass ? !
no , i made a promise to a man , he gave me a ring and i gave him my word .
and your word is shot to hell now ,
don' t you think ?
i don' t ...
i don' t know .
i' il find out when i talk to him .
this is not about keeping your promise , and it' s not about following your heart , it' s about security .
what is that supposed to mean ?
money !
what are you ta ...
he' s got a lot of money .
now i hate you , you smug bastard .
well , i hate you .
if you leave here , i hate you .
you wou ...
hate you if you leave here .
have you been paying attention to anything that' s happening ?
i guess not .
i think i must have misread
all of those signals .
i guess you did .
you' re bored .
you' re bored and you know it .
you wouldn' t be here if there wasn' t something missing .
you arrogant son of a bitch !
would you just stay with me ?
stay with you ?
what for ?
look at us , we' re already fighting .
well , that' s what we do .
we fight .
you tell me when i' m being an arrogant son of a bitch and i tell you when you' re being a pain in the ass .
which you are 99 % of the time .
i' m not afraid to hurt your feelings .
they have like a two second rebound rate and you' re back doing the next pain in the ass thing .
so , what ?
so it' s not gonna be easy .
it' s gonna be really hard .
and we' re gonna have to work at this every day , but i want to do that , because i want you .
i want all of you , forever , you and me , every day .
will you do something for me ?
please ?
will you just picture your life for me ?
30 years from now , 40 years from now , what' s it look like ?
if it' s with that guy , go !
go !
i lost you once , i think i could do it again , if i thought it' s what you really wanted .
but don' t you take the easy way out .
what easy way ?
there is no easy way , no matter what i do , somebody gets hurt .
would you stop thinking about what everyone wants .
stop thinking about what i want , what he wants , what your parents want .
what do you want ?
what do you want ?
it' s not that simple .
what do you want ?
it' s not ...
goddamn it , what do you want ?
i have to go .
my dearest allie ,
i couldn' t sleep last night because i know that it' s over between us .
i' m not bitter anymore , because i know that what we had was real .
and if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives ,
i' il smile at you with joy and remember how we spent a summer beneath the trees
learning from each other and growing in love .
the best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more , that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds .
and that' s what you' ve given me .
that' s what i' d hoped to give to you forever .
i love you .
i' il be seeing you , noah .
it' s beautiful .
it' s a beautiful story .
yes , it is .
i don' t know why , but it makes me feel sad .
i know you feel lost right now , but don' t worry , nothing is ever lost , nor can be lost .
the body sluggish , aged , cold , the embers left from earlier fires .
shall duly flame again .
did you write that ?
no , that was walt whitman .
i think i knew him .
i think you did .
shall we go in ?
i' m feeling a little chilly .
okay .
thank you .
well , who did all of this ?
i did , with a little help from my friends on the nursing staff .
oh ...
i' ve never seen anything so beautiful .
neither have i.
shall we ?
some grape juice ?
i' d love it .
ah , so many pills .
how sick are you ?
the sickness has become a relative term for me .
i think of it now as more a general wearing out process .
to you .
so what happened ?
in the story , which one did she choose ?
okay , the way i see it , i got three choices .
one , i can shoot him .
two , i can kick the crap out of him .
or three ...
i leave you .
well , all that' s no good .
you see , ' cause ... none of those options get me you .
and in spite of everything ,
i love you .
i love you too .
i meant what i said when i gave you that ring .
i did too .
i did too .
it' s just that when i' m ... when i' m with noah i feel like one person and when i' m with you i feel like someone totally different .
look , it' s normal not to forget your first love .
i love you , allie , but i want you for myself .
i don' t want to have to convince my fiance that she should be with me .
you don' t have to .
i already know i should be with you .
and they lived happily ever after .
who ?
who did ?
oh yes , of course .
i remember now .
it was us .
it was us .
it was us .
oh , my darling .
oh my sweetheart .
i love you so much .
oh , my baby .
noah , noah .
i love you , angel .
what happened to me ?
nothing .
you just went away for a little while .
how much time do we have ?
i' m not sure .
last time it was no more than five minutes .
okay .
