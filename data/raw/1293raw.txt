there' s this group of koreans over in koreatown startin ' this neighbourhood watch thing .
they need some weapons so they can show the neighbourhood niggers they mean business .
now , i' m gonna sell them the other two machine guns , all right ?
the problem is , i ain' t never done business with these koreans before .
i ain' t worried , ' cause by and large asians are very dependable .
they don' t want no trouble .
you might argue with them about price and shit ... but you ain' t gotta worry about them shootin ' you in the back .
never do business with people you ain' t never done business with before without backup .
that' s why i need you .
backup .
look , all you' ve got to do is lay in here and hold on to this motherfucker .
all right ?
i' m gonna tell ' em i' m goin ' in the trunk to show ' em the goods .
when i open the trunk , you pop up and rack this motherfucker .
man , fuck that shit .
i ain' t fixin ' to shootin ' nobody .
i ain' t said nothin ' about you shootin ' nobody .
all you gotta do is hold on to it .
they' il get the idea .
you must be out of your mind if you think i' m gonna get in this dirty ass trunk .
we ain' t goin ' nowhere but to koreatown , man .
you ain' t gonna be in here no more than ten minutes .
i ain' t ridin ' in no trunk for no minute .
why can' t i ride up front with you ?
you can' t ride up front with me .
the surprise element is 90 % of it .
i' m sorry , man , but i ain' t gettin ' in no goddamn trunk .
i can' t believe you' d do me like this .
do you like what , man ?
i just ain' t climbing in no goddamn , dirty ass trunk , man .
i got a problem with small places .
i got a problem to spend $10000 on ungrateful niggers to get them out of jail ... but i did it .
how small was that jail cell , motherfucker ?
i know i owe you , you got to bring all this up .
then get your ass in this trunk .
i want to help you , but i won' t be locked in no goddamn trunk of no car .
you think i wanted to spend $10000 on your ass , huh ?
i know you helped me out .
yes or no ?
of course you didn' t , but look , in the trunk ?
that' s the only way i could help you , right ?
so that' s what i did .
now , look , man , all i' m asking you to do is get in the trunk ... hold this fuckin ' shotgun , point it at these buddha heads when i open it , all right ?
you' re catching a nigger off guard with this shit .
look here .
i tell you what .
when we get through fucking with these koreans ... me and you go to roscoe' s chicken and waffles on me .

i got some for your eyes only shit to show you .
why don' t you step outside ?
who was that ?
that' s beaumont .
who' s beaumont ?
an employee i had to let go .
what' d he do ?
he put hisself in a position where he was gonna have to do ten years in prison .
that' s what he did .
and if you know beaumont ... you know there ain' t no goddamn way he can do ten years .
if you know that , then you know beaumont' s gonna do anything beaumont can ... to keep from doin ' them ten years ... includin ' tellin ' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing ... about my black ass .
now , that , my friend , is a clear cut case ... of him or me ... and you best believe ... it ain' t gonna be me .
now , louis ...
if you gonna come in on this thing with me ... you' ve got to be prepared ... to go all the way .
now , i got me , so far , a half million dollars in lock boxes ... in a bank down in cabo san lucas .
i make this delivery ...
i' m gonna have me over a million .
hey , you think i' m gonna let a little cheese eatin ' nigger like this fuck that up ?
you best think again .
before i let that happen , i' il shoot this nigger in the head ... and ten niggers look just like him .
you understand what i' m saying ?
yeah .
so we on the same page then ?
yeah , i follow .
my nigger .
miss brown !
hi , i' m detective mark dargas , l. a. p. d.
can i ask what you have in that bag ?
the usual stuff .
you know , i' m a flight attendant for cabo air .
can i help out here ?
who' s this ?
sorry , this is special agent ray nicolet with alcohol , tobacco and firearms .
oh , yeah ?
may i see some i. d. ?
yeah .
sure .
would you mind if we just took a look in that bag ?
do i mind ?
do i have a choice ?
yeah .
you have the right to say no .
no .
i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant .
if i don' t want to go to all that trouble , i' d just take you in on suspicion now .
suspicion of what ?
uh , could i say something ?
he just wants to peek inside the bag for a minute .
i' il keep my eye on him so he doesn' t take anything .
go ahead .
thanks a lot .
bad knees .
you have a good flight ?
it' s a shitty flight down to cabo .
i went down there one time with susan , my wife .
fuckin ' turbulence was unbelievable .
hey , can i look in this envelope ?
ah .
goddamn .
i' d say there' s about , oh , uh ... $50, 000 here .
what would you say , ray ?
looks like about 50, 000 from here .
is this your money ?
what if i say no ?
you should know if you bring in anything over 10, 000 , you have to declare it .
you forget , or what ?
you can get a $250, 000 fine , plus two years in prison .
you want to talk to us about this , or do you want to talk to customs ?
i' m not sayin ' another word .
jackie ...
i hope you don' t mind if i call you jackie .
those guys down in customs ?
they' re a bunch of pricks .
excuse me , but they are .
there' s something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with .
you can go down and talk with those guys ... who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings ... or you can talk with a couple of good hearted guys like mark and myself .
it' s up to you .
let' s take a look here at the file on jacqueline brown .
according to this , this isn' t the first time you' ve run afoul of the law .
in 1985 , while a stewardess for delta ... you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot ?
that pilot was my husband , and i got off .
you mean they offered you a deal , and you grabbed it .
he did time ; you did probation .
i didn' t hear you ask permission to smoke in my office .
may i smoke ?
no , you may not .
so you get off with a slap on the wrist ... but all this criminal activity fucks up your shit for good with the big airlines .
cut to 13 years later , you' re 44 years of age ... flying for the shittiest little shuttle fuckin ' piece of shit mexican airline there is ... where you make what , $13000 a year ?
i make 16, 000 , plus benefits .
you been in the service industry 19 years , and all you make is 16, 000 , plus benefits ?
didn' t exactly set the world on fire , did you , jackie ?
jackie , you have a good lawyer ?
can she afford a good one , is more like it .
otherwise you' il be in sybil brand three weeks ... before the public defender gets around to ya .
hey , jackie , do you know a guy named beaumont livingston ?
yeah ?
no ?
because he knows you .
well , he knew you .
he doesn' t know anybody now .
he' s dead .
they found him in a trunk of a car this morning ... shot twice .
once in the chest , once in the head .
here you go .
so i guess i' m wondering .
if you don' t know beaumont ... how do you suppose beaumont knows you ?
look , miss brown , we don' t give a fuck about you .
you know who we want .
if you cooperate , tell us what we want to know , we' il help you get out of this .
if you refuse to cooperate , continue to cop a shit attitude like you' re doing now ... we will give you to customs and they will take you to court .
with your prior , the judge will give you two years .
now , you' il probably only end up serving a year and some change ... but if i was a 44 year old black woman ... desperately clinging on to this one shitty , little job i was fortunate enough to get ...
i don' t think that i' d think i had a year to throw away .
so let' s start again now , shall we ?
who in mexico gave you this money , and who in america were you bringing it to ?
i' m not sayin ' another goddamn word .
i' d like your permission to look through this again so we' il know how much we' re talking about .
sure .
go ahead .
while we' re at it , let' s see what else is in there .
do you mind ?
beauty case .
mm hmm .
what' s in it ?
beauty products .
alarm clock .
glass case .
birth control .
what' s that ?

got caught coming back from mexico with some blow .
they set her bond this afternoon at $10000 .
now , i' m figuring you could take that $10000 you owe me from beaumont ... move it over to the stewardess .
the bond for possession' s only a thousand .
hmm .
yeah .
man , they fuckin ' with her .
they callin ' that shit " possession with intent " .
a 44 year old black woman caught with less than two ounces ... they calling that shit " intent " .
the same thing happen to a movie star , they call it " possession " .
still sounds high .
well , um , she had on her , i believe it was 50 grand in cash .
all right , before we start talking about stewardesses ...
let' s get beaumont out of the way first .
you know , i think somebody already did .
what ?
you ain' t hear ?
hear what ?
somebody with a grudge blew beaumont' s brains out .
oh , shit .
that shit rhymes .
blew beaumont' s brains out .
police make contact with you ?
oh , hell , yeah .
first motherfucking thing they did .
you know , they see i pay a big money bond for my boy ... they start thinking that " where there' s smoke there' s fire " logic .
rousted my ass out of bed 10 : 00 in the morning .
scared the shit out of my woman sheronda .
she thought they was gonna take my ass away for sure .
this stewardess ...
you know her last name ?
brown .
jackie brown .
what does she do for you ?
who said she do anything for me ?
she' s my friend .
my friends get in trouble , i like to help them out .
beaumont worked for you .
this you and me talking , like lawyer client thing ?
you can' t tell nothing i say to you ?
you' re not my client till you get busted and i bond you out .
well , we ain' t got no , uh ...
what you call that shit ?
confidentiality .
why should i tell you anything ?
' cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are .
you got stewardesses bringing you 50 grand .
and why would a stewardess be bringing me 50 grand ?
now you want me to speculate on what you do .
i' d say you were in the drug business , except the money' s moving in the wrong direction .
whatever you' re into , you seem to be getting away with it , so , uh , more power to you .
all right .
you want another bond ?
you want to move the 10, 000 you got on beaumont over to the stewardess .
that means paperwork .
i gotta get a death certificate , present it to the court ... make out a receipt for return of bond collateral , type up another application ...
hey , hey , hey , hey . ... another indemnity agreement .
jackie ain' t got time for this .
i' m telling you what i have to do .
what you have to do , in case you forgot ... is come up with a premium of a thousand bucks .
i can do that .
you know i got the money .
i just ain' t got it with me .
come back when you do .
i' il bond out the stewardess .
look , you got to look at this with a little compassion , all right ?
jackie ain' t no criminal .
she ain' t used to this kind of treatment .
gangsters don' t give a fuck , but your average citizen ... a couple of nights in county get to fuckin ' with their mind .
ordell , this isn' t a bar .
you don' t have a tab .
listen to me , all right ?
you got a 44 year old , gainfully employed black woman falsely accused ...
falsely accused ?
she didn' t come back from mexico with cocaine on her ?
falsely accused of " intent " .
if she had that shit ... and mind you , i' m saying if ... that was her own personal shit to get high with .
is white guilt supposed to make me forget i' m running a business ?
oh , it' s like that , huh ?
all right .
i got you a thousand bucks .
hey , candy .
hey , max .
dropping off lopez , anita .
picking up brown , jackie .
okay , no problem .

i don' t know you
why do i feel this way

and i don' t even know you
miss brown ?
yes ?

i could give you a lift home , if you like .
of your charms

you got any cigarettes in here ?
you won' t find any cigarettes in there .
can we stop and get cigarettes ?
sure .
have you ever been to the river bottom ?
i don' t think so .
it' s all right .
it' s a cop bar .
can we just stop at a 7 eleven or something ?
i thought you might like to have a drink .
i' d love to , but not there .
how ' bout the hilton by the airport ?
is it dark ?
kind of a sports bar .
it doesn' t sound dark .
why does it have to be dark ?
because it looks like i just got out of jail , that' s why .
you' re dropping me off at my place .
there' s a joint near me .
no , thanks .
i quit three years ago .
gain weight ?
ten pounds .
take it off and put it back on .
that' s why i don' t quit .
mm .
if i can' t fly , i' m gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my brand .
you know ... the other day i figured out that i must have written about ... 15, 000 bonds since i' ve been in the business .
i figure about 80 % of those were drug related , so ... if you want , i could help you figure out your options .
so far , they told me if i cooperate ... then i' il get probation , maybe .
or if i stand mute , i can get as much as five years .
does that sound right ?
i' d say that if they try you and convict you , you won' t get more than a year and a day .
that' s state time , prison .
but they won' t want to do that .
they' il offer you simple possession , a couple of months of county time ... and a year or two of probation .
do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag ?
yeah .
but that' s not what this is about .
they were waiting for my ass .
they knew about the money .
they even knew the exact amount .
what did they want to know ?
who gave me the money and who i was givin ' it to .
they found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off .
they said it was him who told them about me .
that would be ...
beaumont livingston .
how do you know about him ?
i wrote him on monday .
they found him dead on tuesday .
ordell pick up his bond ?
same as you ... $10, 000 .
back about 18 and 25
i left tennessee very much alive
thanks for the drink .
you' re welcome .

good luck .
we' il be in touch .
on a tennessee stud
had some trouble with my sweetheart' s pa
one of her brothers was a bad outlaw
i wrote a letter to my uncle fudd
and i rode away on a tennessee stud
the tennessee stud was long and lean
the colour of the sun and his eyes were green
he had the nerve and he had the blood
there never was a horse like the ...

who the hell do you think got your ass out of jail ?
the same guy that put my ass in jail .
thanks a lot .
hey , you got caught with blow .
that' s your business .
it wasn' t mine .
what ?
oh , shit .
i bet that was that present mr walker was sending melanie .
yeah .
if you didn' t put it in there , he must have .
damn .
that shit wasn' t called for .
baby , i' m sorry .
bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions about it , huh ?
and all that money , where it came from .
probably asked you who you was bringin ' it to too .
they asked .
and you said ?
i want to talk to my lawyer " .
you sure you didn' t get nervous and kind of let somethin ' slip ?
i mean , if you did , i ain' t mad at you .
i just gotta know .
you ain' t asking the right questions .
you should be asking why they picked me up .
they were waiting for me .
they knew about the money and they knew the exact amount .
they tell you how they happen to come by this information ?
hmm .
beaumont livingston ?
i knew it .
i knew it .
they even asked me if i knew mr walker .
yeah ?
i didn' t tell them anything about him .
my name come up ?
mm mm .
you ain' t said nothin ' about me ?
mm mm .
ah , that' s mighty noble of you .
they tell you what happened to this beaumont fellow ?
yeah , they told me .
yeah .
somebody must have been real mad at old beaumont .
or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time .
yeah , i bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions .
and you ain' t givin ' them no kind of answer ?
mm mm .
you scared of me ?
you got any reason to be nervous around me ?
is that what i think it is ?
what do you think it is ?
i think it' s a gun pressed up against my dick .
well , you thought right .
now , take your hands from around my throat ... nigger .
what the hell' s wrong with you , jackie ?
shut the fuck up .
don' t you move .
oh , what is this ?
what the fuck is this ?
hey , that ain' t got nothing to do with you .
i carry that all the time .
you been talking to them police too much .
the police didn' t try and strangle my ass .
come on , girl .
i was just playing with you .
i ain' t playing with you .
i' m gonna unload both of these motherfuckers if you don' t do what i tell you to do .
you understand what i' m saying ?
jackie , stop acting crazy .
do you understand what the fuck i' m saying ?

if i have to tell you to shut up one more time , i' m gonna shut you up .
i just came over here to talk to you .
to talk ?
the way i see it , you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about .
one thing ... and that' s what you are willing to do for me .
i can get you a lawyer .
no , let' s be realistic .
now , sooner or later they' re gonna get around to offering me a plea deal ... and you know that .
that' s why you came here to kill me .
i ain' t come over to kill you .
no , that' s all right .
it' s okay .
now , i forgive you .
now , iet' s say , if i tell on you ...
i walk .
if i don' t , i' il go to jail .
uh huh .
i want $100, 000 ... in an escrow account in my name ... if i' m convicted up to a year or put on probation .
now , if i have to do more than a year ... you pay another $100, 000 .
i can do that .
you know i got that problem .
all my money is ...
in mexico .
right .
well , i been thinking about that too .
i got me an idea .
uh ...
let me hear that .
we friends again .
why don' t you point that motherfucking gun somewhere else ?
i' il talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it' s on .
all right .
you want your gun back ?
come on in .
i' il get it for you .
max , look , i am so sorry about this .
you know , i was afraid to ask to borrow it , ' cause i was afraid you would say no .
i mean , you' d have to .
would you like some coffee ?
if you' re having some .
i am .
come on in .
why don' t you make yourself at home .
just , you know , have a seat .
did you get a chance to use it ?
i felt a lot safer having it .
oh , the milk went bad while i was in jail .
black' s fine .
cool .
would you , uh , care to hang on to it for a while ?
it wouldn' t be legal , but if it makes you feel better , i guess ...
well , thanks .
i got one now .
you went out this morning and bought a gun ?
what ?
i didn' t hear you .
you went out this morning and bought a gun ?
well , let' s say i got one now , okay ?
somebody loan it to you ?
yeah .
all right !
we' re on .
it might be a little black .
would you like to hear some music ?
sure .
cool .
you know , i couldn' t wait to get home last night ... and wash the jail outta my hair .
it looks nice .
thanks .
you never got into the whole cd revolution ?
oh , i got a few , but i can' t afford to start all over again .
i mean , i' ve invested too much time and money ... in my albums .
yeah , but you can' t get new stuff on records .
i don' t get new stuff that often .
i gave my heart and soul
to you , girl
didn' t i do it , baby
it' s pretty .
didn' t i do it , baby
mm hmm .
who is this ?
the delfonics .
it' s nice .
didn' t i do it , baby
mm hmm .
didn' t i do it , baby
i called in sick today .
as far as the airline knows , i' m still available .
are you ?
i don' t know .
i' m gonna go in and talk with nicolet and dargas today .
i' m going to do what you suggested ... offer to help and see what happens .
what i meant was to have a lawyer do the negotiating for you .
no , i want to talk to them first .
i know more now about ordell' s money .
well , if it' s the a. t. f. guy that wants you , that' il only interest him up to a point .
i know , but it' s a lot of money .
it' s a half a million dollars all in cabo , and more coming in .
how' d you find that out ?
ordell told me last night .
he called ?
he came by .
what' d you do ?
we talked .
do you think he still trusts you ?
he had his doubts at first , but he' s always trusted me .
and he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can .
why ?
because he needs my ass .
otherwise , that money' s just gonna sit over there in cabo .
you want some sugar ?
no , thank you .
there' s gotta be other ways of getting it out .
maybe , but i' m the only one he' s ever used .
i mean , he can' t use his other people .
they' re crooks .
i mean , he might try to ... bring the money in himself ... but he ain' t gonna wanna stand in no customs lines .
so , either he recruits another cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me .
and i made him feel like he still can .
are you gonna offer to set him up ?
yeah , if i get off .
otherwise , fuck ' em .
it' s very possible that ordell' s killed somebody .
do you realize that ?
well , i ain' t going back to jail , and i ain' t doing that probation thing again .
max , how do you feel about getting old ?
you' re not old .
you look great .
no , i' m asking you how do you feel about getting old .
doesn' t it bother you ?
it' s not really something i think about .
really ?
i guess i got sensitive about my hair a few years ago .
it started falling out , so i did something about it .
how' d you feel about that ?
i feel fine with it .
otherwise , i wouldn' t have done it .
i did it to feel better about myself , and , you know , i do .
i look in the mirror .
looks like me .
yeah , but it' s different for men .
you know , i can' t really feel too sorry for you in this department .
i bet that , except for possibly an afro ... you look exactly the way you did at 29 .
well , my ass ain' t the same .
bigger ?
yeah .
ain' t nothing wrong with that .
something else worry you ?
oh .
i always feel like i' m starting over .
how many bonds you said you wrote ?
15, 000 .
is that a lot ?
that' s plenty .
well , i' ve flown over seven million miles ... and i' ve been waiting on people for 20 years .
then after my bust , the best job i could get was with cabo air ... which is the worst job you can get in this industry .
you know i make 16, 000 a year ... plus retirement benefits that ain' t worth a damn .
and with this arrest hanging over my head , max , i' m scared .
and if i lose this job , i gotta start all over again ... and i ain' t got nothing to start over with .
i' il be stuck with whatever i can get .
and that shit is more scary than ordell .
let' s go .
you don' t have to ...
ow !
hey !
hey , great , you' re here .
yeah .
hey , jackie .
how' re you doing ?
fine .
can i have a word outside with ray for a minute ?
sure .
take your time .
i' il just be a minute .
may i smoke ?
absolutely .
dude , what up ?
she wants to make a deal .
oh , yeah ?
did she sound scared ?
she almost sounds scared .
what' s she want ?
she wants to go back to work .
oh , yeah ?
so what' s she going to give us ?
she hasn' t gone into specifics .
she' s been waiting for you to get here .
she knows it' s my case , right ?
well , she hasn' t said it , but she' s not stupid .
she knows it' s you who wants her .
let' s go .
cool .
jackie , sorry to keep you waiting .
now , what can we do for you ?
i need permission to leave the country so i can keep my job .
yeah , we can look into that .
i need it tomorrow .
if i don' t show up for work tomorrow , i' m fired .
well , you know what we want .
if i' m working, i can help you .
help us do what , jackie ?
help you get ordell robbie .
so now , you do know him .
you never asked if i did or not .
so you' re telling us now that you do know him .
of course i do .
i deliver money for him .
no shit ?
you know how he makes his money ?
he sells guns .
you ever see him sell a gun ?
no .
then how do you know he sells guns ?
he told me .
besides , why else would an a. t. f. man be after him ?
well , how can you help us ?
i' il do anything i can to help you get his ass , short of wearing a wire .
and in return for my help , i need permission to leave the country , and immunity .
you don' t want much , do you ?
can you do it or not ?
you know , i mean ...
it' s possible .
you' re going to hear a guy beg for his life , lady ...
' cause he betrayed nani vitali .
read the paper .
read it !
nani vitali , a dangerous criminal .
he' s already killed two people .
you know what he' s known as ?
the mad dog murderer .
hey , girl .
hola !
hey !
hey , hey , hey !
looks like somebody got some new clothes .
yeah , we did a little shopping .
you know , i couldn' t have my boy running around looking like no bum .
i don' t know .
i didn' t look like a bum .
come on now , man .
you know you had that salvation army thing going .
goddamn , girl .
you getting high already ?
it' s just 2 : 00 .
it' s that late ?
you smoke too much of that shit , that shit' s gonna rob you of your ambition .
not if your ambition is to get high and watch tv .
oh , y' all a couple of cheech and chongs , huh ?
oh , don' t get up .
i got it .
have a seat .
yo .
jackie !
what' s up ?
no , jackie , i didn' t get your message .
i was gonna tell you !
no , no , no , no , no , not on the phone .
here .
you gotta make sure ain' t nobody following you .
it' s ready to go ?
yeah .
there' s another bowl left .
take your thumb off the carb .
shit .
you okay ?
i' m just ... getting old .
i can' t ... smoke or laugh now without coughing .
coughing' s good .
it opens up the capillaries .
you know , when you cough , you' re pulling air ... in this case , smoke ... into parts of the lungs that don' t normally get used .
and so , coughing' s good .
it gets you higher .
you definitely know a lot about that .
look here , louis , i got to run out for a little while .
so , since you like getting high so much ... why don' t you hang out here with mel , watch a little tv ?
way ahead of you .
see , i get high later on when i come back .
see , i get high at night when i get through with all my business .
is that rutger hauer ?
no , it' s helmut berger .
hmm .
why don' t you walk me to the door , space girl ?
okay .
you know , i hope you don' t mind hanging out with louis .
no problem .
try not to tear his clothes off of him , all right ?
they' re new .
ha , ha , ha !
ha , ha !
yo , louis !
catch you later , man .
okay .
later .
want a metrix ?
uh ...
damn .
shit .
what' s a metrix ?
it' s like this major meal that you drink in a shake instead of having a big meal .
it' s like a diet thing ?
no .
it' s what bodybuilders drink to , you know , beef up .
no , thanks .
okay .
when was the last time i saw you ?
oh ... six , seven years ago .
it doesn' t seem like that long ago .
it was that long ago .
how old were you in this picture ?
which one ?
the roller disco picture .
this one .
oh .
um , 14 .
you were 14 here ?
yup .
shit , man .
i thought you were at least 16 .
well , i' m about the same height now as i was then .
that other picture , that green one ?
yeah ?
that was taken at that place called flippers .
do you remember that ?
it was in hollywood .
were you in l. a. then ?
no .
where were you ?
i was in detroit .
with ordell ?
yeah .
we had done some time already .
oh .
were you a ... disco guy ?
nah .
come on .
don' t lie .
no , i wasn' t .
i don' t like to dance .
were you ever in one ?
i went to a few just to meet women , but ... it was so loud and i didn' t like to dance .
during that whole scene , i just drank in bars usually .
so who didn' t make the cut ?
that' s a picture of me in japan .
whose arm is that ?
uh , that' s the guy that i lived with .
his name was hi hiro ...
hiro ...
hiroshi .
he must have made quite an impression .
if you count cheese .
i never got to know him really .
you know , i couldn' t speak any japanese , and his english was terrible .
but what am i going to say ?
his english was better than my japanese , you know .
that sounds like a problem .
not really .
you know , we didn' t have that much to say to each other anyway .
i never really got to know him , but i knew enough to know ... that i wasn' t missing much , so ...
anyway , i keep that picture because , of all the fucking time i was there ... that' s the only picture i' ve got of me in japan .
that' s japan .
oh .
yeah .
well ...
yeah , i can ...
yeah , it looks .
i could tell .
wanna fuck ?
yeah .
that was fun .
yeah .
yeah , that really hit the spot .
now we can catch up .
yeah .
you got a beer ?
yeah , sure .
in the fridge .
uh , i mean , damn me and you forever hand in hand
i' m married to the firm , boo you got to understand
i' il die for ' em gimme a chair and then i' il fry for ' em
and if i got to take the stand i' m a lie for ' em lie for ' em
it' s me and you hand in hand forever
i' m married to the firm , boo you got to understand that we be
i' il die for ' em gimme a chair and then i' il fry for ' em
and if i got to take the stand i' m a lie for ' em uhh , sugar
i' m going to the bar , baby .
jackie jack !
hey .
damn !
i' m gonna have to remember this place .
this is all right .
about two minutes from your crib , ten minutes from the gig .
not bad .
what' s your drink , brother ?
let me get a screwdriver , home .
how' re you doing ?
oh , i' m fine .
yes , you are .
damn !
i bet you come in here on a saturday night ... you need nigger repellant to keep them motherfuckers off your ass .
oh , i do okay .
bullshit , jackie .
you' re a fine motherfucker .
i bet you do a damn sight better than okay .
you think anybody followed you ?
i don' t think so .
but it don' t matter , ' cause they already know i' m meeting you .
how the fuck they know that ?
i told them .
you told ...
3 . 25 .
here .
keep it .
thank you , sir .
you told ' em it' s me ?
they already know it' s you .
goddamn , that don' t mean you got to confirm it .
look , the only way they' re going to give me permission to fly ... is if i agree to help ' em , which is what i have to appear to be doing .
so i might as well give them somebody they already know ... you .
you tell ' em anything else ?
yeah , you got a half a mil in mexico , and you want me to bring it in .
goddamn ...
you told them all that ?
it' s true , ain' t it ?
what the fuck that got to do with anything ?
they know i' m delivering for you .
i told ' em about the half mil .
they could give a fuck about it .
all they wanna do is catch your ass with guns .
so i said , " look , you want proof he' s getting paid for selling ' em ?
let me bring in the money " .
and they said ?
yes .
hey , what' s the matter ?
i mean , that' s what we discussed last night .
this is just seeming kind of risky now , you know .
fuck this .
now , let me lay it all out to you , okay ?
i make two deliveries ... the first with 10, 000 .
you know , like a dry run ?
they watch it , see how it works .
then the second delivery , i come home with the half mil .
mm mm , mm mm .
see , that' s too much exposure .
now , i ain' t goin ' nowhere near that money .
you don' t have to .
i told them you never pick up the money yourself .
you always send someone , and i never know who it is .
that' s a good idea .
if you listen , it' s a damn good idea .
now , the first time i do it , they' re looking around ... they see me hand the 10, 000 to someone .
who ?
i don' t know .
a friend of yours .
like a woman ?
if you want .
yeah .
yeah , i' m thinking a woman .
wait a minute .
if they' re gonna let you go ... how come we don' t bring all the cash in the first time ?
' cause i don' t trust ' em .
now , the next trip , when i bring in the half mils ... it' s gonna look like i' m doing the same thing as i did before .
but you don' t ?
no .
i hand it to someone else first .
hmm .
and they follow the wrong one ... thinking she' s bringing the money to me .
that' s the idea .
so , we gonna need two women .
can you cover that ?
yeah .
yeah , i got the women covered .
where are you planning on pulling this off ?
the del amo mall , the food court .
and i suppose you see a piece of this for yourself ?
it' s my plan .
we' re in this together .
yeah , but it' s my money , and i don' t need no fuckin ' partners .
i ain' t your partner .
i' m your manager .
and i' m managing to get your money out of mexico , into america , in your hands ... and i' m managing to do it all under the nose of the cops .
so , therefore , i' m your manager , and a manager gets 15 % .
no , a manager gets ten percent .
no , that' s an agent .
i' m gonna give you ten .
no .
no .
a manager gets 15 % , agent gets 10 .
i' m getting 15 % , all right ?
all i' m gonna give you is ten .
and the same deal as before .
i can do that .
so he says , " fuck that " , and moves over into guns .
see , you can sell guns wherever there' s a demand , and nobody gives a shit .
he' s acting like he' s this big international arms dealer ... when , come on , face it , the only people he ever sold to were dopers .
well , he seems to be making out .
is it dead ?
yeah .
yeah , well ... so far , he is .
but you got to admit , he' s not too bright .
oh ...
i wouldn' t go so far as to say that .
he moves his lips when he reads .
what does that tell you ?
let' s say that he' s streetwise , you know .
we' il give him that .
he' s still a fuckup .
he killed a man who worked for him the other day .
well ...
so , what are you trying to tell me ?
that i should get out of here ?
that' s not what i' m saying at all .
you know where he went ?
he went to go meet that stewardess .
does that bother you ?
please !
well , i don' t know .
you live with him , so ...
no , i live here .
he just drops in and out .
did he tell you about that half million he' s got down in mexico ?
of course he did .
he tells anybody who' s gonna listen .
well , that' s what him and that stewardess are doing .
they' re scheming on how they can get that money over here .
and your point is ?
let him and the stewardess get the money over here ... and then just take it from them .
can i ask you a question ?
oh , man .
you ain' t gonna get serious while we' re in here chilling ?
no .
it' s just about melanie .
you know what ?
i' m real sorry about that , man ... but i had to be somewhere all of a sudden .
i figured , well , shit , louis ain' t had no pussy for a while .
so i thought , let him kick it here with mel .
so , what she say ?
she didn' t have to say shit .
i know melanie .
that bitch is gonna be fucking you two minutes after i' m out the door .
melanie real good about throwing a fuck a nigger' s way .
i mean , she ain' t no damn good at it , but she likes to fuck .
oh , so she ain' t your girlfriend ?
is that what you thought ?
no , i wasn' t sure .
i didn' t know .
but you fucked her anyway ?
well ... the " not your girlfriend " part i felt more about .
oh .
well , i hope you felt appropriately guilty afterwards .
afterwards , i did .
oh , oh , shit .
but , um ...
but , like , you know , what is she to you ?
you know , she' s just one of the bitches i got set up .
i got mel over in hermosa beach ... and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you' re staying ... and about four blocks away i got this young 19 year old country girl named sheronda .
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia ... barefoot , country as a chicken coop .
took her to my place in compton , told her it was hollywood .
she believed you ?
hell , yeah .
to her dumb country ass , compton is hollywood .
closest she' s ever been , anyway .
but you trust melanie around your business ?
oh !
she trying to play your ass against me , ain' t she ?
yeah .
uh huh .
see , i knew it .
i knew it .
i knew it !
see , you didn' t have to say nothing .
i know that bitch .
i don' t understand why you keep someone around your business and you can' t even trust ' em .
i ain' t gotta trust her .
i know her .
i don' t know what that means , man .
well , you can' t trust melanie ... but you can always trust melanie to be melanie .
well , i don' t understand why you keep her the fuck around .
i told you , man .
she' s my fine little surfer girl .
you know , she ain' t pretty as she used to be ... and she bitch a whole lot more than she used to ... but she white .
you have one message sent at 8 : 06 p . m .
hi , jackie .
it' s max .
i was just calling to find out how everything went today at a. t. f.
if you want to call me , my home number is ... 915 9302 .
or you can reach me at my office , which is ... 313 3688 .
that' s on the card i gave you when we first met .
i don' t know whether you still have it , but it' s on it .
oh , let me give you my beeper number .
it' s 991 1075 ... then dial 6872 .
wait for a beep , dial 59 ... and hit the pound .
um , okay , so i' il talk to you later .
hope everything' s well .
bye bye .
end of message .
now , the money' s gonna be in a del amo shopping bag , all right ?
i get some food , sit down here in the food court , then your girl comes in .
did you find somebody yet ?
mm hmm .
who ?
what you care ?
what i care is my ass facing the penitentiary .
you send some hardheaded rock whore up here and she ...
hey , hey , hey , hey !
she ain' t gonna be no rock whore .
she' s gonna be cool , i promise .
all right , so we' re straight , right ?
mm hmm .
i' m gonna roll up over here and check out this shirt i was looking at .
i' il catch you .
hey , don' t forget your bags .
shit !
max !
max !
hey .
well , hello .
hey , surprise .
i walked right past you .
i know , ignoring me .
so , what are you up to ?
just catching a movie .
what' d you see ?
what the fuck is up with this shit ?
i called you last night .
i know .
i got your message .
ray wanted to have dinner with me so we can , you know , talk about the sting we' re plotting .
that' s what he calls it , a sting .
he' s been ...
he' s been real nice .
you think he' s got a thing for you ?
maybe .
but i' m thinking it' s something more like he wants the money for himself .
has he hinted around ?
no .
he just tries to act cool .
you know , i don' t think there' s anything wrong with that .
he' s just a young guy having fun being a cop .
i know the type .
trust me on this .
he' s more interested in ordell than he is in the money .
if he does anything suspect , it' il be cutting corners to get the conviction ... but he wouldn' t walk off with the money , it' s evidence .
and what about you , max ?
what ?
if i was in nicolet' s place ?
no , i mean you right now , not if you were somebody else .
if i saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money , would i take it ?
you know where it came from .
it' s not like it' s somebody' s life savings .
it wouldn' t even be missed .
half a million dollars will always be missed .
you' re avoiding the question , max .
okay , sure , i guess i' d be tempted ... especially now since i' m getting out of the bail bond business .
why ?
a lot of reasons .
i guess the main one would be , uh ...
i' m tired of it .
when did you decide ?
it' s been a long time coming ... but i finally made up my mind .
i guess it was ...
thursday .
miss brown ?
yes ?
i' m max cherry , your bail bondsman .
the night you got me out of jail ?
yeah .
i went to pick up this guy .
i hear he' s staying at a house , and , uh ...
i sneak in , and i' m waiting for him ...
wait a minute .
after we were together , you snuck into a guy' s house ?
yeah .
i went back to my office and found out that you took my gun ... got another gun and the stun gun ... went to this guy' s house in el monte and waited for him to come home .
what do you do when he comes home ?
shoot him with the stun gun .
while he' s incapacitated , you cuff him and take him to county .
you do that ?
it' s my job .
did you do that that night ?
well , the guy never came home .
but i' m sitting on his couch in the dark holding my stun gun .
the whole house smells of cat pee .
and after a couple of hours , i think ...
why am i doing this ?
it' s 19 years of this shit .
and i make up my mind .
that' s it .
i' m not sure you answered my question , max .
which one ?
if you had the chance , unemployed now ... to walk away with a half million dollars ... would you take it ?
we gotta stop meeting like this .
how was your flight ?
fine .
bet you' re happy to be working again .
yeah .

you rationalize .
i can do it , max .
i know i can .
i just can' t do it without you .
it' s cool .
excuse me , baby .
uh , do you know what time it is ?

i gave my heart and soul
to you , girl
didn' t i do it , baby
didn' t i do it , baby

jackie brown .
it ain' t like i' m asking you to go somewhere and spend the night .
i just want you to go out for a little while while i work this deal .

what the hell i' m talkin ' about ?
sheronda passed the money on to somebody else .
how do you know she did that ?
i was there !
i saw it !
you weren' t supposed to be there .
i knew you would try to pull some shit like that !
hold up !
i ain' t pulling no shit !
what do you call it , then ?
it' s my goddamn money !
i can do whatever the fuck i wanna do with it .
with my ass on the line , oh , no , you fuckin ' don' t !

oh , no !
chill , my ass !

the woman you saw was my friend simone .
she' s the one gonna be receiving the money .
i think she oughta see how the shit go down .
she' s a nice woman .
you' il like her .
matter of fact , she' s on her way over here right now .
hold up .
louis , call simone .
tell her to get her ass over here .
we' re waiting on her .
damn !

oh , just a little pissed ?
mm , mm , mm .
i' m sorry .
i' m about ready for a refill .
are you sure i can' t tempt you a little bit more ?
come on .
okay , fine .
yeah .
you better give me something strong .
now , nicolet and dargas are gonna stop me at the airport and mark your bills .
i don' t like that part .
it washes off !
i tell ' em we do the same thing as before , and they' il follow sheronda .
yo , louis .
louis ?
she ain' t there ?
yo !
no answer ?
hmm ?
now , you gotta listen to this , man , ' cause this concerns you , all right ?
lou !
hmm ?
okay , now , this time you' re going to get sheronda a billingsley bag , right ?
right .
the same one simone gives me , okay ?
now , simone and i make the switch in billingsley .
she knows what i look like ?
she' s seen you with sheronda , remember ?
all right .
now , simone' s gonna meet you in the dress department , right ?
right .
designer clothes .
right , right , right .
the place y' all try shit on .
it' s a fitting room .
big sign over the door .
you can' t miss it .
uh ...
why over there ?
because they' re gonna be watching my ass hard .
that' s why we can' t take the risk in doing it out in the open ... or even in the dining area .
that' s why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman .
okay .
now , you' re going to take ... the billingsley bag simone gives you and give it to sheronda .
right .
and simone is going to wait .
then she' s going to peep out the dressing room , wait on you ... to give her the sign there ain' t nobody watching .
she' s going to leave the store , get in the car , mission accomplished .
hey !
see ?
so , what are you going to be doing during all this ?
now that you got ' em watching my ass , i' m gonna be in a titty bar waiting on louis ... to call me and tell me everything' s cool .
i got to go !
hey !
damn !
who' s wantin ' to page you like that ?
it' s ray , the a. t. f. guy .
that shit works my nerves , you and that motherfucker being so buddy buddy .
hey , if i wasn' t so buddy buddy with that motherfucker , this wouldn' t work .
ordell has a guy working for him named louis .
you two meet ?
yeah , this afternoon before i came here .
he was at ordell' s apartment in hermosa beach .
yeah .
i don' t know if he lives there , but i can find out .
did you talk to him ?
not really .
mm mm .
a fellow named louis gara .
just did four years up in susanville .
for what ?
bank robbery .
we' ve been following him .
he definitely works for ordell .
they did two years together about , i don' t know ... 20 years ago or so over at huntsville .
he' s not living over in hermosa beach , though .
ordell' s got him staying down at compton .
living with some 56 year old petty thief , some woman named , uh ...
hawkins , simone hawkins .
hmm .
you know her ?
no .
they ever talk about her ?
not yet .
okay , who' s the other one ?
some white chick named melanie , another girlfriend of ordell' s .
what' s her deal ?
it was her coke i got busted with .
oh , yeah ?
she knows everything .
she' s not a part of it ... and she' s pissed off that she' s not a part of it .
well , this is definitely somebody i wanna meet .
okay , are we all set up for tomorrow ?
everything okay ?
everything' s the same , except for one change .
i told him ordell' s changing the amount he' s bringing in .
think they bought it ?
mm , oh , yeah .
i got ' em thinking that ordell' s real nervous ... and they love thinking that he' s scared of ' em .
you know , a good cop will never let you know that he knows you' re full of shit .
all he needed was a reasonable explanation .
everything' s the same , except for one change .
what' s that ?
ordell feels way too hot for him to bring in his money ... and he knows you' re watching him and he' s fucking paranoid .
so he' s sweating a little bit .
he' s gonna keep his half mil where it is ... but he' s gonna bring in 50, 000 just in case he needs bail .
it' il be more than that .
don' t be so literal .
ray believed it .
you still have to show him the money at the airport .
i' m not gonna show him the whole amount .
he' il see 50, 000 .
and where' s the rest of it ?
in the bag , underneath .
what if he checks ?
he won' t .
he didn' t before .
he' s expecting to see 50, 000 , and there it is , on top .
you' re taking a hell of a chance , kid .
not really .
if he finds it , i' il say mr walker put it in there ... and i didn' t know anything about it , like the coke .
well , then you' re out .
you get nothing .
yeah , but i' m not in jail ... and at least i tried .
you' re going to have surveillance all over you .
that' s why you don' t make a move until i come out of that fitting room .
wearing a dress .
well , a suit .
there' s this one i had my eye on .
you know , it' s like ...
excuse me .
hello ?
look here , we got a little change in plans .
no , no , no , no , it ain' t no thing .
everything' s the same , except one little difference .
you know that bitch simone you saw in the mall ?
well , she wasn' t here today ' cause she done split on my ass .
yeah .
me and louis went by her pad .
she' s gone .
she' s gone , her shit' s gone and my 10, 000 motherfucking dollars is gone .
hey , hey , hey !
don' t start buggin ' on me .
goddamn it , i' m telling you , ain' t nothing different .
everything' s just like we discussed .
now , except for this time when we make the split ... instead of simone it' s gonna be melanie .
i think someone' s knocking on the door .
goddamn it , melanie got just as much sense as that bitch has .
she' il be in the same place .
all right .
yeah , later .
yeah ?
well , i' m gonna open it .
i hope he' s a good sailor .
chicken shit .
okay , the envelop contains $50, 000 .
i' ve counted it , and i' m now marking the bills ... in the upper left hand corner in the second zero with a green felt tip pen .
ever been tempted ?
what ?
put one of these in my pocket ?
mm hmm .
if i did , i' d have to give one to you , wouldn' t i ?
of course , nobody knows how much there is .
i guess we could take as much as we want .
isn' t that right ?
yes .
all those things are true .
i mean , it' s not like the money belongs to anybody .
that would be one point of view .
yeah .
except it' s not a point of view shared by the a. t. f.
once we make this evidence , it belongs to us .
you' re officially out of trouble now .
don' t go doing something stupid .
how can i do anything stupid when i' m being watched every second ?
you know , i' m glad you pointed that out ...
' cause it saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you .
now , look .
here' s the deal .
i want you to take all this cash .
i want you to put it in this billingsley shopping bag .
and that is exactly what i expect to see ... when i look inside sheronda' s billingsley shopping bag .
comprende ?
s , comprende .
cool .
hey , there' s only three reasons you couldn' t make your court appearance .
one , you' re in a hospital , two , you' re in jail , three , your ass is dead .
that means you' re not my friend , man .
why' re you putting ...

here you go .

there' s nobody in there .

i tried so many times and that' s no lie
it seems to make you laugh each time i cry
all right .
just keep drivin ' to ninth , where all them car dealerships is .
we gonna leave this heap in the parking lot and pick up ... a car the cops don' t know nothin ' about .
where' s melanie ?
that' s what i wanna tell you .
she was buggin ' me the whole time .
she got pissy with me ' cause i wouldn' t let her carry the bag .
and then she started runnin ' her fuckin ' mouth about , you know , like ...
' cause i couldn' t remember where the car was parked right away when we came out .
so then she got on me about that .
is it this aisle , louis ?
is it that aisle , louis ? " it was totally fuckin ' with my nerves , man .
so , what ?
you left her there ?
i , i shot her .
you shot melanie ?
twice .
in the parking lot .
you couldn' t talk to her ?
well , how can you talk to her ?
you know how she is .
you couldn' t just hit her ?
maybe , but at that time ... moment , i don' t know , i ...
you shot her ?
twice ?
is she dead ?
i ...
pretty much .
what do you mean " pretty much " , louis ?
that ain' t no fuckin ' answer .
yes or no .
is she dead ?
i think so .
you think so ?
tell me louis .
is she ...
she' s dead .
she' s dead .
well , where' d you shoot her ?
in the chest and the stomach .
if you had to do it , then you had to do it , brother .
what we don' t want is that bitch survivin ' on us .
anybody but that woman .
louis ?
what ?
where' s the rest of it ?
how much is there ?
i don' t know .
maybe 40 .
shit , maybe less .
well , you ... you said 550 .
yeah , so you light , ain' t you ?
you light about half a million , ten .
look , look , man .
that' s the bag she came out with .
she never put her hand in it .
neither did i.
came out of where ?
the fitting room .
it went down exactly the way it was supposed to .
how long was she in there ?
a minute .
not even a minute .
she came right out .
louis , you tellin ' me the truth ?
listen , i swear to god , man .
i swear on my life .
she came out with that fuckin ' bag , and i took it from her .
and then what ?
and that was it .
we went to the parking lot .
where you shot her ?
that' s right .
louis , you sure melanie ain' t in a room somewhere ... with a half million dollars ...
i worked my ass off to get waitin ' for you ?
fuck you for asking me that .
i know the bitch tried to set me up .
fuck you , brother .
how could you fuckin ' ask me that ?
she didn' t ask you ?
shit !
pull the car over a minute .
why' d you ask me that ?
all right , so where' s the gun you shot her with ?
it' s in there .
now , what the fuck' s that gonna tell ya ?
i could' ve taken two out already .
it' s jackie brown .
well , you know , if she got to it , why didn' t she take it all ?
oh , i' il be sure and ask that bitch before i blow her brains out .
well , maybe the feds got it .
uh uh , uh uh , uh uh .
see , if there wasn' t nothin ' ... in that bag but them towels ... then maybe she didn' t get a chance to take the money ... out of her suitcase and the a. t. f. got it .
but she put them books in there to trick our ass .
well , that' s why i didn' t check it .
because the bag felt right .
that' s right .
and then she puts 40 grand or so in there ... to rub that shit in my face .
you know what i' m sayin ' ?
she wants me to know she ripped me off .
ah .
i don ...
i don ...
you know , i don' t know .
i don' t know .
unless , you know , either she' s got it or the feds got it .
or ...
or ...
now , check this out .
what if she gave the money to somebody else first ... before melanie even went in the dressing room .
uh huh .
oh , man .
you know what ?
what ?
do you know who i saw in the dress department ?
no , tell me .
i didn' t think anything of it .
i ...
no , no , i did wonder ... what he was doin ' there .
i wondered what he was doin ' there , but i thought it had ... nothin ' to do with us .
like , maybe he was with his wife or his girlfriend .
it' s a big place ...
louis , louis , louis !
you gonna tell me who you saw ?
yeah , max cherry .
max che ...
you seen max cherry in the dress department where we ...
man , look at me when i' m talkin ' to you !
you see that motherfucker in the dress department when we ... about to get a half million dollars .
and you don' t think nothin ' about him bein ' there ?
no .
do they know each other ?
hell , yeah , they know each other .
he bonded her ass out of county .
well , how am i supposed to know that ?
you know your bail bondsmen .
you know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes , don' t you ?
why should i think something' s weird if i don' t know nothin ' ... about them knowin ' each other ?
i don' t wanna hear no fuckin ' excuses , louis .
i ain' t givin ' you excuses .
but i' m tellin ' you ...
i don' t fuckin ' ...
i' m givin ' you fuckin ' reasons .
oh , you gonna tell me the reason ... you lost every goddamned cent i got in the world ?
hey ...
hey , man .
you gonna tell me reasons ?
you better ...
let me tell you the reason , motherfucker .
the reason is your ass ain' t worth a shit no more .
you better fuckin ' back off , man .
what the fuck happened to you , man ?
your ass used to be beautiful .
you didn' t tell me you were goin ' shoppin ' .
i thought i did .
yeah , well , you didn' t .
you know , if it' s me ... and i got all that shit hangin ' over my head like you got hangin ' over yours ...
i don' t know , i' d go shoppin ' later .
well , i got there early .
you see , i' ve had my eye on this suit ... that i' ve wanted , and , well , i' m just gonna go try it on ...
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
wait , wait , wait .
just wait a minute .
just wait a fuckin ' second , all right ?
let me finish .
i got there early .
the idea was to try on the suit , see if i liked it .
if i did , they would wrap it up , and i would put back on my uniform ...
' cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it .
meet sheronda , give her the shopping bag with the $50, 000 and go home .
yeah , but you didn' t do that .
because i couldn' t .
ray , i swear .
melanie burst in .
she grabbed the bag .
and then somebody fuckin ' killed her for it .
what happened to the bag she gave you ?
she didn' t give me a bag .
melanie was not a part of the plan .
ordell probably told her to do it .
that' s why she came into the dressing room , grabbed the bag , took off .
but i couldn' t go after her , because i was in my fucking underwear .
and i had to put on this suit because i could put it on faster than my uniform ...
you had time to pay the sales chick .
i had to .
ray , i was frantic .
what was i supposed to do ?
all right , what you do after that ?
i went lookin ' for you .
and i went back to the place in the mall ... where you were before , but you weren' t there .
what was i supposed to do if something happens ?
you didn' t tell me how to do that .
there was a guy with melanie ?
there was nobody in the fitting room .
okay .
you' ve no idea what happened to the $50, 000 .
you' re clueless , right ?
you' ve no idea where the 50 grand is ?
i have no idea .
none .
you have no idea ...
none .
it could' ve gone here , could' ve gone there ?
i know nothin ' .
not a clue .
i don' t have an idea where the motherfuckin ' money is .
not even a little idea .
a maybe .
not a tiny motherfuckin ' idea .
you' d take a polygraph ?
yeah , if it' d motherfuckin ' make you happy !
yeah , put it right there .
i' il do it .
man .
i sure hope you didn' t do anything stupid , jackie .
i gotta talk to you for a second .
fuck .
louis gara' s dead .
l. a. p. d. found him shot in the car on ninth .
and we lost ordell .
i thought you were fuckin ' watchin ' him .
we were , and we lost him .
he walked into a strip bar sometime around 3 : 30 and never came out .
the bar was on ninth , what , less than a mile and a half from where they found louis .
it looks like louis ' buddy shot him twice , point blank range .
so what' s gonna happen now ?
we pick up ordell .
we got three murders we can link him to , and we got you .
what about me ?
what about you ?
you think i took some of that money ?
hey , i have no evidence of you doin ' anything .
you didn' t pay for that snazzy new suit with marked bills .
i' m glad to see that .
you' ve been helpin ' us out .
you gave us melanie .
you gave us louis .
melanie was found with a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts .
that goes a long way in backing up your story .
i' il settle for ordell with marked bills .
but if there' s anything else ... you haven' t told me about , you know what , that' s between you and ordell .
i just got one thing to say .
you better hope we find him before he finds you .
no , no , no , i done told you , i can' t leave here tomorrow , mr walker .
i ain' t goin ' no goddamn way anyway till i get my motherfuckin ' money .
come on , man .
if it wasn' t for me , you wouldn' t have that motherfuckin ' boat .
oh , yeah , yeah , right .
i' m seein ' who my friends are , motherfucker , right ...
hello ?
hello ?
motherfucker hung up on me .
do you believe that shit ?
ingrate nigger .
see , you bring a motherfucker up ... next thing you know they breaking you off some goddamned disrespect .
motherfuck !
shit !
goddamn , girl .
how you live like this ?
like what ?
like this .
this some repugnant shit .
bail bonds .
yeah , max there ?
he ain' t here right now , man .
well , where he at ?

he' s around , man .
well , give me his home number .
no , i' il give you his beeper number !

yeah .
i' ve been looking for you .
do you know who this is ?
this is mr robbie , isn' t it ?
i have your 10, 000 .
that' s why you called .
the bond collateral that you put down on beaumont livingston ... and moved over to miss brown , remember ?
oh , she got off , did she ?
they decided to no file this morning .
tell me where you are .
i' il come give you your money .
you still there ?
look here , man .
i know you helped her .
and i know you know what i want .
and jackie can tell me any story comes into her pretty little head ... as long as at the end of that story she hands me my motherfuckin ' money .
now , she wanna be my friend , she do that .
she don' t want to be my friend no more ... well , you just tell her to think about old beaumont .
and if she go to the police ... you tell her i will name her ass as my accessory .
and we' il go upstate , hand in handcuffed motherfuckin ' hand .
and that' s a promise .
do you understand what i' m sayin ' ?
you tell her that , and i' il call you back .
you' re right .
it was ordell .
if you have time , do you think you could find out where he' s stayin ' for me ?
cops can' t locate him , huh ?
they don' t have your winning personality .
sure thing .
i don' t have to know what i' m doing , just as long as you know .
i think i do .
good enough ?
you bet .
fuck' s wrong with you , knockin ' on the door like the goddamned police ?
you lookin ' to get shot ?
i thought you might be asleep .
you keep fuckin ' with me , you the one gonna be asleep .
forever .
i' m alone .
get your ass in the house .
no , freeze , motherfucker .
what you doin ' ?
you want your money ?
your bond refund ?
this all ?
i have a receipt for you to sign .
no , no , no , motherfucker .
you know what i mean .
you talked to her ?
she wants to give you your money .
if she didn' t , there' d be cops batteramming your door down right now .
how' d you find me , anyway ?
winston found you .
how' d he find me ?
that' s what he does .
he finds people that don' t wanna be found .
oh , well , bully for that nigger .
so , she wanna give me my money , huh ?
yeah .
she wants to give it to you herself , and she wants to collect her ten percent .
she also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it .
oh , and i wanna hear that shit too .
turn around .
put your hands on your head .
why don' t you tell me why ?
jackie didn' t trust melanie .
she' d already tried to get jackie to go in with her ... split the half million amongst themselves .
what she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money .
and you helped her , didn' t you ?
all i did was walk out with it .
y' all went to all that trouble just to protect my interest ?
in a way , yes .
my ass may be dumb , but i ain' t no dumb ass .
go over there and sit on that couch .
don' t worry about her .
she don' t even know you' re here .
sit down .
place stinks .
you get used to it .
where my money at ?
my office .
where jackie at ?
she' s been there since thursday night .
if she want to talk to me , how come she wasn' t home ?
she' s afraid .
oh , right .
that i gotta see .
she still is .
she doesn' t wanna get shot before she can tell you what happened .
tell her to bring the money over here .
it' s in the safe , she can' t .
call her and give her the combination .
look , i' m tellin ' you , you got her spooked .
she won' t leave there till you get your money and you' re gone .
oh , you expect me to just go walkin ' in there ?
if she wanted to set you up , you' d be in custody by now .
when you told her that you' d name her as an accessory , that scared her more than anything .
she believed you .
mmm .
then that' s why she wanted to give me my money , ain' t it ?
it ain' t got nothin ' to do with that bullshit about melanie , huh ?
see , i ain' t trust melanie either , but i could handle her .
that was my little blonde haired surfer girl .
and i told that fuckin ' louis all he had to do was hit her in the mouth .
but no , he had to shoot her .
jackie' s at your office , huh ?
uh huh .
she by herself ?
that big ass nigger winston ain' t there , is he ?
she' s all alone .
all right .
