sergeant , command says air support is holding till they can assess our status .
our status is we need some gorram air support .
that skiff is shredding us , sir .
they won' t move without a lieutenant' s authorization code , sir !
here .
here' s your code .
you' re lieutenant baker !
congratulations on your promotion .
now get me some air support .
pull back just far enough to wedge ' em in here .
get your squad to high ground start pickin ' ' em off .
high ground is death with that skiff .
that' s our problem .
thanks for volunteering .
bendis .
give us some cover fire . we' re going duck huntin ' .
just focus .
the alliance said they were gonna waltz through serenity valley .
and we choked ' em with those words .
we' ve done the impossible , and that makes us mighty .
just a little while longer .
our angels are gonna be soaring overhead , raining fire on those arrogant khangs .
so you hold !
you hold !!
go !
really think we can bring her down , sir ?
you even need to ask ?
ready ?
always .
bendis .
bendis !
yeah .
huh .
zoe .
nice cover fire .
did you see that ?
green , what' s our status on
zoe .
hey , listen to me !
bendis , look at me !
listen .
we' re holding this valley , no matter what .
we' re gonna die .
we' re not gonna die .
we can' t die , bendis .
and you know why ?
because we are so very pretty .
we are just too pretty for god to let us die .
huh ?
look at that chiseled jaw , huh ?
come on .
if you won' t listen to me , listen to that .
those are our angels .
they' re gonna blow the alliance to the hot place .
zoe , tell the 82nd to
they' re not coming .
command says it' s too hot .
they' re pulling out .
we' re to lay down arms .
but what' s
the vault' s sealed .
okay , i' m gonna boil it .
jayne , give me the sticky .
okay , we get the goods .
we' re off this wreck and back on the ship .
no worries .
everything looks good from here .
yes .
yes , this is a fertile land , and we will thrive .
we will rule over all this land , and we will call it ...
this land .
i think we should call it your grave .
curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal .
mine is an evil laugh .
now die .
oh , no , god .
oh , dear god in heaven .
oh , motherless son of a bi
full pressure .
the goods must be intact .
okay .
lookin' good .
captain , we got incoming alliance cruiser bearing right down on us ! $$ ## $$ !!
have they spotted us ?
i can' t tell if  have they hailed us ?
if they' re here for the salvage , we' re humped .
they find us at all , we' re humped .
thievin' ain' t
i don' t like this .
wash , shut it down .
now !
evetything but the air .
kaylee .
kaylee .
go to blackout .
we' re being buzzed . $$ ## $$ ...
goin ' dark .
okay , now i can' t get down .
what am i looking at ?
it' s a carrier .
blew out a few months back .
lost all hands , but it was only run by a skeleton crew anyway .
damn shame .
no point in checking for survivors ?
wash , they slowin' down ?
that' s a neg .
doesn' t look like they' re interested in us .
we should be eating wake in a minute or two .
sir , there is a reading on that thing .
some residual heat .
do a sweep .
$$ ## $$ !!
captain , we' re humped !
prep the ship now !
we move these in double time !
kaylee , fire it up .
it' s a transport ship .
firefly class .
they still make those ?
illegal salvage .
low life vultures picking the flesh off the dead .
should we deploy gunships and bring her in ?
do it .
cry , baby cry .
make your mother sigh .
engaging the crybaby .
captain , i am picking up a distress signal 13 clicks ahead from a sounds like a personnel carrier .
definitely a big ship , sir .
and she' s without power .
wash , we' re on .
go .
hang on , travelers .
let' s moon ' em .
they' re rabbitting , sir .
should we continue deployment ?
our gunships would never get back to us in time .
all right .
let' s go help these people .
but put out a bulletin on the cortex and flag interpol .
a firefly with possible stolen goods on board .
maybe somebody' il step on those roaches .
we look shiny , captain .
they are not repeat not coming about .
close one .
yeah .
any one you walk away from , right ?
as long as we got the goods , i call this a win .
right .
we win .
take my love , take my land   take me where i cannot stand   i don' t care , i' m still free   you can' t take the sky from me   take me out to the black   tell them i ain' t comin' back   burn the land and boil the sea   you can' t take the sky from me
there' s no place i can be   since i' ve found serenity   but you can' t take the sky from me
well , there we are .
they' re awfully pretty .
i' d say worth the little risk .
yeah , that was some pretty risky sittin' you did there .
that' s right .
of course .
' cause they wouldn' t arrest me if we got boarded .
i' m just the pilot .
i can always say that i was flying the ship by accident .
they' re pretty
problem , sir ?
couldn' t say .
but we best be gettin ' rid of these before we run into another alliance patrol .
what the hell they doin ' out this far anyhow ?
shining the light of civilization .
how long till we reach persephone ?
three or four hours .
can we shave that ?
we' re down to the wire on fuel cells .
we run hot , we might not even make it .
play it as close as you can .
this catch is burning a hole in my hull .
think that cruiser might have i. d. ' d us ?
let' s hope not .
contact badger .
tell him the job' s done .
don' t go to mentioning the cruiser though .
keep it simple .
sir , we' re sure there' s nothing wrong with the ca  it' s fine .
just want to get paid .
all right .
let' s get these crates stowed .
i don' t want any tourists stumblin ' over ' em .
we' re taking on passengers at persephone ?
that' s the notion .
could use a little respectability on the way to boros .
not to mention the money .
pain in the ass .
no , it' s shiny .
i like to meet new people .
they' ve all got stories .
captain , can you stop her from bein ' cheerful , please ?
i don' t believe there' s a power in the ' verse ... can stop kaylee from bein ' cheerful .
sometimes you just want to duct tape her mouth and ... dump her in the hold for a month .
i love my captain .
i know somethin ' ain' t right .
sweetie , we' re crooks .
if everything were right , we' d be in jail .
it' s just that the captain' s so tense .
the man needs a break .
in fact , we could all use a couple days ' leave .
we still gotta drop the goods .
and when we do , we' il fly off to boros , rich and prosperous well , less poor but with enough to find some sweet little getaway .
oh , wouldn' t mind a real bath .
and a meal that included some form of food .
just a couple of days lying around .
you with the bathing .
me with the watching you bathe .
well , if the captain says it' s all right .
what if we just told mal we need a couple of days ' stead of asking him ?
he' s the captain , wash .
right .
i' m just the husband .
look , i' il ask him .
don' t forget to call him " sir .
he likes that .
who likes what ?
it' s nothing , sir .
has the ambassador checked in yet ?
nah . i think she had a pretty full docket .
after you talk to badger , let her know we may be leaving persephone in a hurry .
inara has our timetable .
she should be checking in .
i can tell her to cut it short , meet us at the docks .
no , no .
don' t want to get in her way if we don' t have to .
somebody on this boat has to make an honest living .
oh , my god .
oh .
sihnon isn' t that different from this planet .
more crowded , obviously , and i guess more complicated .
the great city itself is pictures can' t capture it .
it' s like an ocean of light .
is that where you studied ... to be a companion ?
i was born there .
i can' t imagine ever leaving .
well , i wanted to see the universe .
do you ... really have to leave ?
i mean ...
i my father is very influential .
we could i could arrange for you to be
the experience has been more than it was very good .
thank you .
the time went too quickly .
well , your clock' s probably rigged to speed up and cheat us out of our fun .
serenity , this is shuttle one .
what' s you e. t. a. ?
inara , hey .
we' re touching down at the eavesdown docks ... in about 10 minutes .
i' il join you there .
thanks .
lookin' forward to it .
we missed you out here .
yeah .
me too .
go on .
this shouldn' t take too long .
put us down for departure in about three hours .
grab any supplies we' re low on , fuel her up .
i' d sure love to find a brand new compression coil for the steamer .
i' d like to be the king of all londinum and wear a shiny hat .
just get us some passengers .
them as can pay .
all right ?
the compression coil busts , we' re drifting .
best not bust then .
zoe $$ ## $$ ... $$ ## $$ .
we will .
going on a trip , grandpa ?
you need safe passage ?
we' re cheap .
we' re cheap , we' re clean .
the brutus best ship in the ' verse .
what' s your des , grandpa ?
come on .
we' re hittin ' the outer rings .
uh , i never married .
what ?
i' m not a grandpa .
let me see your teeth .
yes .
you' re late .
you' re lying .
what did you just say to me ?
you' re well aware we landed two hours before we planned to ... with all the goods you sent us after intact , ready to roll .
so your decision to get tetchy , say we' re late ... means you' re lookin' to put us on the defensive right up front .
which means something' s gone wrong .
it didn' t go wrong on our end .
so why don' t we start again with you tellin ' us what' s up .
you' re later than i' d like .
well , i' m sorry to hear that .
you' d gotten here sooner ... you might' ve beaten the bulletin that came up sayin ' ...
rogue vessel , classification firefly ... was spotted pullin ' illegal salvage on a derelict transport .
didn' t i. d. us .
doesn' t lead to you .
no , it doesn' t .
but a government stamp on every molecule of the cargo just maybe might .
oh , you noticed that .
you were gonna hand over imprinted goods and just let me twist ?
is that the case ?
we didn' t pick the cargo .
and i didn' t flash my ass at the gorram law .
there' s no deal .
that ain' t fair .
crime and politics , little girl the situation is always ... fluid .
the only fluid i see here is the puddle of piss refusing to pay us our wage .
it doesn' t have to go this way .
you know you can still unload those goods , so i can' t help thinking ... there' s something else at work here .
what were you in the war ?
that big war you failed to win .
you were a sergeant , yeah ?
sergeant malcolm reynolds .
balls and bayonets brigade .
big , tough veteran .
now you got yourself a ship , and you' re a captain .
only i think you' re still a sergeant , see .
still a soldier .
man of honor in a den of thieves .
well , this is my gorram den ... and i don' t like the way you look down on me .
i' m above you .
better than .
businessman , see ?
roots in the community .
you' re just a scavenger .
maybe i' m not a fancy gentleman like you ... with your ... very fine hat ... but i do business .
we' re here for business .
try one of the border planets .
they' re a lot more desperate there .
of course , they might kill you .
but you stay here , and i just know the alliance will track you down .
i have that feeling .
wheel never stops turnin ' , badger .
that only matters to the people on the rim .
you' re gonna come with us .
excuse me ?
you like ships .
you don' t seem to be looking at the destinations .
what you care about is the ships , and mine' s the nicest .
she don' t look like much .
oh , she' il fool ya .
you ever sail in a firefly ?
long before you were crawling .
not an aught three though .
didn' t have the extenders .
tended to shake .
so , uh , how come you don' t care where you' re goin ' ?
' cause how you get there is the worthier part .
are you a missionary ?
i guess .
i' m a shepherd from the southdown abbey .
book .
i' m called book .
been out of the world for a spell like to walk it a while .
maybe bring the word to them as need it told .
well , i' m kaylee .
and this here' s serenity ... and she' s the smoothest ride from here to boros for anyone can pay .
can you pay or
well , i got a little cash and , uh
ooh .
grandpa .
i never married .
i don' t understand why we didn' t leave that sumbitch in a pool of his own blood .
we' d be dead .
can' t get paid if you' re dead .
can' t get paid if you crawl away like a bitty , little bug neither .
i got a share of this job .
ten percent of nothing is
let me do the math here .
nothin ' and then nothin '
so we find a buyer on boros .
there' s gotta be
boros is too big .
it' s crawlin ' with alliance .
they could be waiting for us .
you really think badger will sell us out to the feds ?
if he hasn' t already .
the alliance catches us with government goods , we' il lose the ship .
that' s never gonna happen .
sir , we could just dump the cargo .
no ruttin' way .
we ain' t had a job in weeks .
i didn' t sign on to take in the sights .
we need coin .
jayne , your mouth is talkin ' .
you might wanna look to that .
i' m ready to stop talkin ' when  you' re right , though .
the last two jobs we had were weak tea .
we got nothin ' saved .
takin ' on passengers won' t help near enough .
we don' t get paid for this cargo , we don' t have enough money to fuel the ship .
let alone keep her in repair .
she' il be dead in the water .
so we do like badger said ?
the border planets ?
i' m thinking whitefall , maybe talk to patience .
sir , we don' t want to deal with patience again .
why not ?
she shot you .
well , yeah .
she did a bit .
still
so we find somebody else .
horowitz .
he can' t afford it .
holden boys .
they wouldn' t touch it .
want me to go through the list ?
capshaws are brain blown .
gruviek' s dead .
he' s dead ?
town got hit by reavers .
burned it right down .
i ain' t goin ' anywhere near reaver territory .
them people ain' t human .
whitefall is the safest and the closest .
it' s been a long time since patience shot me ... and that was due to a perfectly legitimate conflict of interest .
i got no grudge .
she owns half that damn moon now .
she could afford what we got , and she might need it .
i still don' t think the old lady' s the way .
i' m not sayin' it won' t be tricky ... but we got no kind of choice .
welcome aboard , mr.  dobson .
dobson .
we gotta keep our heads down ... do the job , and pray there ain' t no more surprises .
please be careful with that .
mal , this is simon .
simon , this is our captain .
captain reynolds .
welcome aboard .
this all we got ?
now we have a boat full of citizens right on top of our ... stolen cargo .
that' s a fun mix .
ain' t no way in the ' verse they could find that compartment , even if even if they were looking for it .
why not ?
' cause .
oh , yeah .
this is gonna go great .
if anyone gets nosy , you know , just ... shoot ' em .
shoot ' em ?
politely .
inara .
just in time .
let me guess .
we' re in a hurry .
looks like .
starboard hatch green for docking .
locked in five , four
the ambassador has returned .
we got a full house , captain .
kaylee , i' m lockin ' it up .
all aboard .
meals are taken up here in the dining area .
kitchen' s pretty much self explanatory .
you' re welcome to eat what there is any time .
what there is is pretty standard fare protein in all the colors of the rainbow .
we do have sit down meals next one being at about 1 800 .
i think shepherd book has offered to help me prepare something .
you' re a shepherd ?
i thought the outfit gave it away .
is it a problem ?
of course not .
it' s not a problem ...
' cause it' s not .
no .
as i said ... you' re welcome to visit the dining area anytime .
apart from that , i have to ask you to stay in the passenger dorm while we' re in the air .
the bridge , engine room , cargo bay they' re all off limits without an escort .
some of my personal effects are in the cargo bay .
i figure you all got luggage you' re gonna need .
soon as we' re done here , we' il be happy to fetch ' em with you .
now , i have to tell you all one other thing ... and i apologize in advance for the inconvenience .
unfortunately , we' ve been ordered by the alliance ... to drop some medical supplies off on whitefall . it' s the fourth moon on athens .
it' s out of our way , but we should have you on boros no more than a day off schedule .
what medical supplies ?
i honestly didn' t ask .
probably plasma , insulin whatever they ain' t got enough of on the border moons .
alliance says jump  all right .
zoe , you want to take them to the cargo bay ?
yes , sir .
anything else you need , just ask .
we , uh , live to serve .
did you send word to patience ?
ain' t heard back yet .
didn' t she shoot you one time ?
everybody' s makin ' a fuss .
oops .
i' m sorry .
ah , the ambassador graces us with her presence .
hello , mal .
i see we have some new faces .
hey , you .
hey , you .
ambassador , this is shepherd book .
i' d have to say this is the first time we' ve had a preacher on board .
well , i wasn' t expecting to see a state official either .
ambassador .
i' m missing something funny .
not so funny .
ambassador is mal' s way of saying
she' s a whore , shepherd .
the term is " companion .
i always get those mixed up .
how' s business ?
none of yours .
she is pretty much our ambassador .
there' s plenty of planets wouldn' t let you dock without a decent companion on board .
this this isn' t a problem for you , is it , shepherd ?
well , i
i certainly  it' s all right .
i mostly keep to myself .
when i' m not whoring .
don' t you want to meet the rest of the bunch ?
why don' t you make sure they want to meet me first ?
so how many fell madly in love with you and wanted to take you away from all this ?
just the one .
i think i' m slipping .
oh , i' m starved .
this is incredible .
it is great .
it' s not much .
i had a garden at the abbey ... thought i should bring what i could .
it' s very kind of you to share with all of us .
it won' t last .
i' m taking this to wash .
they' re not the same when they' re frozen .
pass the tomatoes .
the important thing is the spices .
a man can live on packaged food from here till judgment day if he' s got enough rosemary .
captain , do you mind if i say grace ?
only if you say it out loud .
so , does it happen a lot ?
government commandeering your ship ...
telling you where to go ?
that' s what governments are for get in a man' s way .
well , it' s good if the supplies are needed .
we' re just happy to be doing good works .
i hear a lot of the border moons are in bad shape plagues and famine .
some of that' s exaggerated , and some of it ain' t .
all those moons , just like the central planets ... they' re as close to earth that was as we can make ' em gravity , atmosphere and such , but
once they' re terra formed , they' il dump settlers on there ... with nothing but blankets , hatchets maybe a herd .
some of them make it .
some of them
then i guess it' s good we' re helping .
you' re a doctor , right ?
oh , uh , yes , i was a trauma surgeon on osiris in capital city .
long way from here .
you seem so young to be a doctor .
yeah .
you' re pretty young to be a ship' s mechanic .
know how .
machines just got workings , and they talk to me .
that' s a rare gift .
well , not like being a doctor .
helping fix people that' s important .
little kaylee here just wishes you was a gynecologist .
jayne ... you will keep a civil tongue in that mouth , or i will sew it shut . is there an understanding between us ?
you don' t pay me to talk pretty .
just because kaylee gets lubed up over some big city dandy
walk away from this table .
right now .
what do you pay him for ?
what ?
i was just wondering what his job is ... on the ship .
public relations .
$$ ## $$ ...
if i' m intruding  not at all .
i expected you .
couldn' t really say the same .
so , would you like to lecture me on the wickedness of my ways ?
i brought you some supper .
but if you' d prefer a lecture ...
i have a few very catchy ones prepped .
sin and hellfire .
one has lepers .
i think i' il pass .
but thank you for this .
the captain said you might like it .
i was surprised at his concern .
for a lowly whore ?
it was unjust of him to say that .
believe me , i' ve called him worse .
anyway , i suspect he has more interest in making you uncomfortable than me .
he' s not wildly interested in ingratiating himself with anyone .
yet he seems very protective of his crew .
it' s odd .
why are you so fascinated by him ?
because he' s something of a mystery .
why are you ?
because so few men are .
mal , you might want to get up here .
what is it ?
a signal .
somebody went on the cortex , hailed the nearest alliance cruiser .
tell me you scrambled it .
all to hell , but i don' t know how much got through .
alliance got a pin in us for sure . $$ ## $$ !!
we got a mole on board .
forget your toothpaste ?
are you out of your mind ?
just about .
what' d you tell them ?
tell who ?
i got exactly no time for games .
what do they know ?
you' re a lunatic .
and you' re a gorram fed .
hate to say it , captain ... but you' ve got the wrong man .
son of a bitch .
drop that firearm , captain reynolds .
this is not my best day ever .
simon tam , you are bound by law to stand down .
what ?
the doctor .
oh .
hey , is there is there a reward ?
get on the ground .
get on the ground .
lawman , you are making a mistake .
get on the ground , son .
the man seems a mite twitchy .
i think everybody could stand to calm down a bit .
this isn' t your business , shepherd .
the boy' s not going anywhere , lawman .
as i understand it , it' s pretty cold outside .
not to worry .
put lord fauntleroy in one of the passenger cells .
he won' t make a peep
get the hell away from that weapon ..
do you think i' m a complete back birth ?
you' re carrying a fugitive across interplanetary borders .
you think i believe you' re bringing medical supplies to whitefall ?
as far as i care , everyone on this ship is culpable .
well , now .
that has an effect on the landscape .
please , we' re very close to true stupidity here .
i got a cruiser en route for intercept .
so talk all you want .
you got about 20 minutes .
you might have less than that .
yeah , threaten me .
for god' s sake .
you think i wouldn' t shoot a shepherd ?
back off ..
take the kid .
get your hands off ..
stand the hell down .
what is
stop it ..
wha  kaylee .
how do you feel ?
a little odd .
be still .
be still .
out of the way .
you' re not killing this man .
not right away .
he' s no threat .
why did he
oh , wow .
that ain' t hardly a mosquito bite .
big mosquito .
move .
not gonna happen .
i ain' t jokin ' , preacher .
jayne .
just tie him up .
do it .
kaylee , stay with me .
stay with me .
can you move your feet ?
are you asking me to dance ?
she' s going into shock .
kaylee .
mei mei , you have to focus .
the gun , shepherd .
please .
the infirmary working ?
yeah , we got it stocked .
captain , we' ve been hailed by a cruiser ordered to stay on course ... and dock for prisoner transfer .
change course .
run .
hell with you .
you brought this down on us .
i' m dumping you with the law .
mal .
she' s dying .
you' re not gonna let her .
yes , i am .
no , you can' t .
no way the feds' il let us walk .
then we dump him in a shuttle and leave him .
everybody' s so mad .
it' s okay .
do you know what a stomach wound does to a person ?
i surely do .
then you know how crucial the next few minutes are .
you let her die , you' il never make it to the feds .
she' il still be dead .
you rich kids .
you think your lives are the only thing that matters .
what' d you do ?
kill your folks for the family fortune ?
i don' t kill people .
then do your job .
turn the ship around .
enough .
mal , do it .
don' t you ever tell me what to do on
zoe , change course .
help me get her up .
wash , change course and go for hard burn .
we' re runnin ' .
you have an extractor ?
got a laser saw .
no , that' s not good enough .
uh , my room , red bag .
when this is over , you and me are gonna have a personal chat .
won' t that be fun .
dope her .
can' t do any more till she stabilizes .
will she ?
i can' t say yet .
i want to know what' s going on here .
well , then why don' t we find out ?
what are no .
no .
stay away from that .
where' s the fed ?
secured .
the shepherd' s with him .
he seems to think he' s not safe alone with me .
no .
well , let' s see what a man like you would kill for .
no , don' t ..
huh .
i need to check her vitals .
oh , is that what they call it ?
she' s not supposed to wake up for another week .
the shock  the shock of what ?
waking up ?
finding out she' s been sold to some border world baron ?
or i' m sorry .
was this one for you ?
is it true love ?
you do seem a little
r river
hey .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
i' m here .
simon .
simon , they they talk to me .
they want me to they want me to  no .
they' re gone .
they' re gone .
they' re gone .
they' re gone .
we' re safe now .
we' re safe .
we' re safe .
i' m here .
come here .
what the hell is this ?
this is my sister .
i am very smart .
i went to the best medacad on osiris .
top three percent of my class .
finished my internship in eight months .
gifted " is the term .
so when i tell you that my little sister ... makes me look like an idiot child ...
i want you to understand my full meaning .
river was more than gifted .
she
she was a gift .
evetything she did you know , music , math ... theoretical physics , even even dance there was nothing that didn' t come as naturally to her ... as breathing does to us .
and she could be a real ... brat about it too .
i mean , she used to
there was a a school a , uh a government sponsored academy .
we had never even heard of it , but it had the most exciting program the most challenging .
we could have sent her anywhere .
we had the money , but ... she wanted to go .
she wanted to learn .
she was 14 .
i , uh
i got a few letters at first , and then i didn' t hear for months .
finally i got a letter that made no sense .
she
she talked about things that never happened .
jokes that we never
it was a code . it just said ...
they' re hurting us .
get me out .
how' d you do it ?
money .
and and luck .
for two years i couldn' t get near her .
then i was contacted by some men some underground movement .
they they said that she was in danger , that that the government was ... playing with her brain .
if i funded them , they could sneak her out in cryo ... get her to persephone , and from there i could take her ... wherever .
will she be all right ?
i don' t know if she' il be all right .
i don' t know what they did to her .
or why .
i i just have to keep her safe .
that' s quite a story , son .
yeah .
it' s a tale of woe .
very stirring .
in the meantime , you' ve heaped a world of trouble on me and mine .
i never thought  no , i don' t imagine you thought .
in consequence of which we got a kidnapped federal officer on board ... we got the alliance hard on our trail and kaylee
how much does the alliance know ?
i can' t say .
i killed the message pretty quick , so they may just have our position .
or they might have personal profiles on each and every one of us .
till that fed wakes up , we won' t know .
so what do we do ?
the job .
we finish the job .
i got word from patience .
she' s waiting for us .
we circle round to whitefall ... make the deal , get out , keep flying .
what about us ?
kaylee comes through , you and your sister get off at whitefall .
if she doesn' t come through ?
well , then you' re getting off a mite sooner .
that' d be murder .
boy made a decision .
he didn' t shoot her .
no , but somebody else on this boat did ... and i' m scratching my head as to why we ain' t dealt with him .
kill a fed ?
can you think of a stupider thing to do ?
he can i. d. us .
throw me out the air lock .
fine .
but river is not a part of this .
can we maybe vote on the whole murdering people issue ?
we don' t vote on my ship .
my ship is not the rutting town hall .
this is insanity .
i think we' re a ways beyond that now , sir .
we' re gonna talk this through .
i will not sit by ... while there' s killing .
the way it is is the way it is .
we gotta deal with what' s in front of us .
mal , you know those two wouldn' t survive a day in whitefall anyway .
you throw them out , i' m leaving too .
it might be best you do .
you ain' t a part of this business .
what business is that exactly ?
i' m a dead man .
i can' t know ?
is it gold ?
drugs ?
pirate treasure ?
what is it that makes you so afraid of the alliance ?
you don' t want to go down this road with me , boy .
oh , you' re not afraid of them ?
i already know you' d sell me out to them for a pat on the head .
hell , you should probably be working for them .
you certainly fit the profi
saw that comin ' .
i' m in a tricky position .
i guess you know .
got me a boatload of terribly strange folk makin ' my life a little more interesting ... than i generally like .
chief among them an alliance mole
likes to shoot at girls when he' s nervous .
now i gotta know how close the alliance is ... exactly how much you told them before wash scrambled your call .
so ...
i' ve given jayne here the job of finding out .
he was nonspecific as to how .
now you' re only gonna scare him .
pain is scary .
just do it right .
you have any idea how much trouble you' re in ?
gee , i never been in trouble with the law before .
no , not like this you haven' t .
you think this is just a smuggling rap ?
the package that boy is carrying  it' s a girl .
she' s cute too .
except i don' t think she' s all there , you know .
course , not all of her has to be .
that girl is a precious commodity .
they' il come after her .
long after you bury me , they' il be coming .
oh , i' m not gonna kill you , dobson .
what' s your first name ?
lawrence .
lawrence .
ah .
i' m just gonna cut on ya till you tell me how much they know .
they know everything .
they know every name , every record .
they know how many ... nose hairs you' ve got .
aw , see ?
they don' t know a damn thing .
it' s all over your face .
i ain' t even
i was gonna get me a ear too .
aren' t you an officer of the law ?
well , don' t they teach you how to withstand interrogation ?
you can' t even tell a damn lie .
okay .
i can see you' re not an idiot .
wish i could say the same , lawrence , but this is disappointing as hell .
let me speak a language you will understand money .
this girl is worth a lot of money .
i mean a lot .
now , you kill me , there' s nothing .
but if you help me out ... you' il have enough to buy your own ship .
better one than this piece of crap .
does helping you out mean turning on the captain ?
yes , it does .
how the hell' d they find us ?
you said we could get around them .
it' s not alliance .
you sure ?
nah , it' s a smaller vessel .
commercial ?
uh , yeah .
i read it as an older model ...
trans u.
i didn' t think trans u still operated .
they don' t .
get me a visual .
they' re still too far out .
get me somethin ' .
i' m picking up a lot of radiation .
they' re operating without core containment .
that' s $$ ## $$ ...
that' s suicide .
reavers .
oh , god .
oh , god .
oh , god .
this is the captain .
we' re passing another ship .
looks to be reavers .
from the size , probably a raiding party .
could be they' re headed somewhere particular .
could be they already hit someone and they' re full up .
so everyone stay calm .
we try to run , they' il have to chase us . it' s their way .
we' re holding course .
we should be passing them in a minute .
so we' il see what they do .
zoe , you come on up to the bridge .
uh , i don' t understand .
you never heard of reavers ?
uh
campfire stories men gone savage on the edge of space , killing
they' re not stories .
what happens if they board us ?
if they take the ship , they' il rape us to death ... eat our flesh and sew our skins into their clothing .
and if we' re very , very lucky , they' il do it in that order .
there' s their magnetic grappler .
they get a hold of us with that
just tell me if they alter course .
they' re holding course .
i guess they weren' t hungry .
didn' t expect to see them here .
they' re pushing out further every year too .
gettin ' awful crowded in my sky .
hey , captain .
hey .
hello , kaylee .
what' s the news ?
i' m shiny , captain .
a ok .
i can' t feel much below my belly though .
it' s gettin ' cold .
well , you just gotta rest .
something' s gonna break down on this boat real soon .
who else i got to fix it ?
oh , don' t you worry none .
doc fixed me up pretty .
he' s nice .
don' t go workin ' too hard on that crush , mei mei .
doc won' t be with us for long .
you' re nice too .
no , i' m not .
i' m a mean old man .
he wasn' t gonna let me die .
he was just trying to
it' s nobody' s fault .
okay .
just promise me you' re gonna remember that .
i' il keep it in mind .
you are a nice man , captain .
you' re always looking after us .
you just gotta have faith in people .
she' s a real beauty , isn' t she ?
it' s just a standard companion immunization package .
thank you .
i' m not sure if it' il help in this  it won' t hurt .
supplies down there are pretty rudimentary .
is there anything else i can do ?
i don' t think so , but i appreciate it .
kaylee' s very dear ... to all of us .
i i' m sorry .
for my part in what happened .
i i' ve never
i mean , i i don' t know how to
you' re lost in the woods .
we all are .
even the captain .
the only difference is he likes it that way .
no , the only difference is the woods are the only place i can see a clear path .
what' s your business here ?
it' s my business .
the usual .
i gave the boy ... a free thrust since he' s not long for this world .
what are you doing in my shuttle ?
it' s my shuttle .
you rent it .
then when i' m behind on the rent , you can enter unasked .
i thought you were leaving anyhow .
well , i guess that depends on you .
you' il ruin her too , you know .
this is the thing i see you' re uncomprehending on .
everyone on this ship ... even a legitimate businesswoman like her ... their lives can be snatched away because of that fed .
you got a solution for that ?
you got a way around ?
i don' t .
comes time , someone' s gonna have to deal with him .
that should be you .
but i don' t think you got the guts .
and i know you don' t have the time .
what do you mean ?
kaylee' s dead .
the man' s psychotic .
you are psychotic .
no , you should' ve seen his face .
oh , i' m a bad man .
and kaylee' s really okay ?
yeah .
to tell the truth , i didn' t expect her to heal this quick .
doctor knows his trade , i' il give him that .
being hailed .
that' d be patience .
we' re close enough for vid .
put her up .
malcolm reynolds ?
hello , patience .
i have to say , i didn' t look to be hearin ' from you anytime soon .
well , we may not have parted on the best of terms .
i realize certain words were exchanged .
also , certain bullets .
but that' s air through the engine . it' s past .
we' re business people .
besides , your days of fighting over salvage rights are long behind you , what i hear .
what are you , mayor now ?
just about .
you tellin ' the truth about that cargo ?
' cause your asking price is a bit too reasonable for that much treasure .
it' s imprinted alliance hence the discount .
oh , government goods , huh ?
that doesn' t work for you , no harm .
just thought you could use  alliance don' t scare me .
just collatin ' data , as they say .
i like that you' re up front about it .
we can deal .
i' il upload coordinates for a rendezvous point outside of town .
see you in the world .
i believe that woman' s plannin ' to shoot me again .
she meant to pay you , she' d have haggled you down some .
just a little effort to hide it would' ve been
sir , we don' t have to deal with her .
yes , we do .
here' s a little concept i been workin' on
why don' t we shoot her first ?
it is her turn .
that doesn' t get us what we need either .
there' s moons we ain' t seen .
we could try our luck  our luck ?
you notice anything particular about our luck these past few days ?
any kind of pattern ?
you depend on luck , you end up on the drift no fuel , no prospects ... beggin' for alliance make work , gettin' towed out to the scrap belt .
that ain' t us .
not ever .
patience has got the money to pay ... and she will , one way or another .
there' s obstacles in our path , and we' re gonna deal with ' em one by one .
we' il get through this .
we will .
nice place for an ambush .
that it is .
here you are .
i buried ' em good .
equipment' s back on the boat .
testing .
testing , captain , can you hear me ?
i' m standing right here .
you' re comin ' through good and loud .
' cause i' m standing right here .
yeah , well , but ... the transmitter' s
patience is gonna figure we buried the cargo ... which means puttin ' us to our ease before there' s any action .
she' il come at us from the east ... talk the location out of us .
she' il have the coin to show us first .
we get it , give the location .
snipers hit us from there ... and there .
you figure they' re in place yet ?
should be .
feel like takin ' a walk around the park ?
sure you don' t just want to piss yourself and back down like you did with badger ?
walk soft .
i want patience thinkin ' they' re still in place .
don' t kill anyone if you don' t have to .
we' re here to make a deal .
don' t think it' s a good spot , sir .
she still has the advantage over us .
everyone always does .
that' s what makes us special .
lawman .
it' s shepherd book .
i believe you' re in more danger
ah .
mal .
how you doin ' , boy ?
walkin ' and talkin ' .
is that zoe ?
you still sailin ' with this old bum ?
awful lot of men to haul three crates .
yeah , well , i couldn' t be sure my mal here wouldn' t be lookin' for some kind of payback .
you understand .
we' re just on the job , patience .
not interested in surprises .
i don' t see my cargo anywhere .
and you' re not gonna till i' m holdin ' 200 in platinum .
oh , come on , reynolds .
i' m supposed to take it on faith that you got the goods ?
it' s pure , patience .
genuine a grade foodstuffs protein , vitamins ... immunization supplements .
one of those would feed a family for a month .
longer , if they don' t like their kids too well .
yep .
that' s the stuff .
so where' s the rest ?
simon ?
what' s wrong , sweetie ?
look at you , all woke up .
oh , i' m sorry about what happened before , but make so much as a sound ... the next one goes through your throat .
and east half a mile , bottom of the first hill you' il see where it' s been dug .
i reckon i will .
well , then .
yep .
i' d appreciate it if you all turn around and ride out first .
well , you see , there' s a kinda hitch .
we both made out on this deal .
don' t complicate things .
i got a rule .
i never let go of money i don' t have to .
which is maybe why i' m runnin' this little world ... and you' re still on that dinky old boat sniffin ' for scraps .
got the money back .
there' s no need for killin ' .
we' re just gonna walk away , sir ?
guess that' s up to patience , here .
could be messy .
not terribly .
mal , you just ain' t very bright , are ya ?
that' s quite a rifle .
boy must be your best shot to carry that .
called " two fry " .
always makes it quick and clean .
two fry .
nice hat .
should think about asking the captain to drop you somewhere else .
whitefall ain' t exactly civilization in the strictest sense .
you don' t have to worry about me .
well , zoe' s out on a deal .
i always worry .
so , it' s not out of my way .
he took her .
he took river .
oh , don' t don' t you dare .
watch out ..
hyah ..
hyah .
zoe ?
armor' s dented .
well , you' re right about this being a bad idea .
thanks for sayin ' , sir .
mal , don' t you take another step .
now i did a job .
i ain' t got nothing but trouble since i did it ... not to mention more than a few unkind words as regard to my character .
so let me make this abundantly clear .
i do the job ... and then i get paid .
go run your little world .
mal , it' s wash ..
we got a ship comin' in ..
they followed us .
the gorram reavers followed us .
no , don' t .
don' t move .
reavers ..
reavers , incoming and heading straight for us .
we are in the air in one minute .
i guess they got hungry again .
you can do that ?
you' re gonna kill a lawman in cold blood ?
i know what you did for your sister .
i understand .
it doesn' t make you a killer .
i don' t want to hurt anybody .
i have a job to do to uphold the law that' s what we' re talking about here .
come on , come on .
where the hell are you guys ?
there' s nowhere you can take her the law won' t find .
nobody is going to hurt her ... unless you hurt me .
no , i said .
i said don' t don' t move .
it' s your call .
i' m not playing anymore .
anybody makes so much
jayne ..
wash , we' re on .
how close are they ?
about 20 seconds from spitting distance .
well , lose ' em .
gimme the vid .
$$ ## $$ .
how close they need to be to fire those grapplers ?
dodge ' em ..
if everyone could just be quiet a moment .
i need kaylee in the engine room , please .
can she even  get her in there now .
i want you in your shuttle .
get the civilians and get ready to go .
we can' t just leave you here .
well , that was the plan .
mal , don' t do this .
we get boarded , you take off .
head for town .
we might be able to stop them from following you .
they' il kill you .
inara
go .
how we doin ' ?
i don' t mean to alarm anybody ... but i think we' re being followed .
you three , come with me .
i think i can help kaylee out .
should i  take her .
keep her safe .
can' t keep this up .
they get a bead , they' re gonna lock us down .
kaylee , how we doin ' ?
gonna need a little push here .
you want me to go for full burn ?
not just yet .
but set it up .
you know where the press regulator is ?
head of the class .
we' re ready for full burn on your mark .
full burn in atmo ?
that won' t cause a blowback , burn us out ?
even if it doesn' t , they can push just as hard , keep right on us .
wash , you gotta give me an ivan .
i' il see what i can do .
kaylee .
how would you feel about pullin ' a crazy ivan ?
always wanted to try one .
jayne , open the port jack control , cut the hydraulics .
where the hell is  look .
look .
look where i' m pointing .
okay .
now it' s real simple .
they' re on us .
kaylee .
come on , come on , come on , come on .
okay .
everybody hold on to something .
here' s something you can' t do .
now .
i knew i hired you for something .
whoo .
whoo hoo .
ain' t no way they can come around in time to follow us now .
we' re good , people .
we' re out of the woods .
whoo hoo hoo .
yeah .
that' s my girl .
that' s my good girl .
we should have just enough left in us to hit a fuel station .
we' il need to do some patching up .
i hope we got paid today .
we did .
sir ?
i' d like you to take the helm , please .
i need this man to tear all my clothes off .
work , work , work .
should really have the young doctor look at this .
it' s not so bad .
well , i' m sure you' il be fine .
i didn' t say that .
is this what life is ... out here ?
sometimes .
i' ve been out of the abbey two days .
i' ve beaten a lawman senseless .
i' ve fallen in with criminals .
i' ve watched the captain shoot the man i swore to protect .
and i' m not even sure if i think he was wrong .
shepherd
i believe .
i just
i think i' m on the wrong ship .
maybe .
or maybe you' re exactly where you ought to be .
the shot i gave you will help you sleep .
i slept for so long , didn' t i ?
just a little while .
and then we' il find a place .
we' il find a safe place .
i didn' t think you' d come for me .
well , you' re a dummy .
the girl' s a problem .
the lawman said they' d keep looking for her .
something about her ... brain bein' all special , important to the alliance brass .
sooner we dump them two , the better .
suppose so .
funny how the lawman got out of his room ... you havin ' tied him up so well and all .
i didn' t have nothing to do with that .
anyhow , it all turned out just fine .
buzzards are the only ones gonna find him .
but he did try to make a deal with you , right ?
how come you didn' t turn on me , jayne ?
money wasn' t good enough .
what happens when it is ?
well , that' il be an interesting day .
imagine it will .
you need me to look at that ?
it' s just a graze .
so , where do you plan on dumping us ?
there' s places you might be safe .
if you want the truth , though , you' re probably safer on the move .
and we never stop movin ' .
i' m confused .
no , wait .
i i think maybe you' re confused .
it may have become apparent to you that the ship could use a medic .
you ain' t weak .
don' t know how bright you are , top three percent , but ... you ain' t weak , and that' s not nothin ' .
you live by my rule you keep your sister from doing anything crazy you could maybe find a place here , till you find a better .
uh , i' m trying to put this as delicately as i can .
how do i know you won' t kill me in my sleep ?
you don' t know me , son , so let me explain this to you once .
if i ever kill you , you' il be awake .
you' il be facing me , and you' il be armed .
are you always this sentimental ?
i had a good day .
you had the alliance on you criminals and savages .
half the people on this ship have been shot or wounded , including yourself ...
and you' re harboring known fugitives .
well , we' re still flyin ' .
that' s not much .
it' s enough .
