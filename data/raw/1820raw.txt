very well .
it' s the best thing that i' ve produced in 25 years .
hello , george .
how are you ?
healthy and wealthy , i see .
you' ve rearranged a holiday for me and i won' t forget it .
for you , charles , anything .
you won' t regret it .
i' m sure .
have you got the tickets ?
they' re in my pocket .
there' s mrs barrie .
oh , mr and mrs snow .
we were so hoping to speak with your husband before the show .
have you seen him ?
i' m not sure where he is , actually .
we do miss seeing you on stage .
you were so wonderful .
yes , well , it' s been some time now .
are you right to find your seat ?
oh , yes , yes .
see you at the party , then .
excuse me .
could you find mr barrie and remind him that they' re doing his play this evening .
yes , ma' am .
thank you .
let' s close the doors .
really , i mustn' t inconvenience you in this way .
i can wait quite well in the shop .
' tis no inconvenience .
the shop is chilly .
and there is a fire here .
really , you are uncommonly good .
sorry , sir .
mrs barrie wanted me to remind you that the play' s begun .
though i imagine you know that .
they hate it .
sir ?
it' s like a dentist' s office out there .
why ?
i wouldn' t say they hate it , sir .
what do you think ?
do you like it ?
i' ve just been hired here , sir .
yes or no ?
i' m not bothered .
i' m not really qualified to ...
do you like it ?
is it crap ?
crap , sir ?
go on , say it .
just say it .
it' s shite , isn' t it ?
go on .
say it .
don' t know if i' m ...
" it' s bull' s pizzle , mr barrie . " go on , say it .
it' s bull' s pizzle , mr barrie .
i knew it .
no , i haven' t even seen it .
i knew it .
thank you .
thank you very much .
might i knock a tune , milord , for a moment ?
i' m an old man ... ... and i' ve seen few of the sights .
absolute rubbish from start to finish .
yes , i found it fearfully dull .
say goodbye to your investment , old boy .
good to see you .
my apologies .
we' il get them with the next one , charles , i promise .
of course we will , james .
i know you put a lot into this one .
a fortune , james , but i am fortunate because i can afford to lose a fortune .
can you ?
no , i can' t .
how are you ?
arthur .
james .
you were sorely missed at the last club meeting .
was i ?
we were beginning to wonder which is your hobby , writing or cricket .
you wanted to speak with mr barrie , didn' t you ?
oh , yes , but we shouldn' t interrupt them , should we ?
i don' t see why not .
if you ask me , the problem lies in our batting order .
james .
hello , darling .
you remember mr and mrs snow , don' t you ?
mrs snow .
mr barrie .
mr snow .
the snows have been waiting to meet with you all evening .
oh , yes .
is that right ?
your play this evening , it was remarkable , wasn' t it ?
was it ?
well , thank you .
that' s very kind of you .
i' m glad you liked it .
how did you feel it went ?
i think i can do better .
really ?
mary ?
hello ?
yes , james ?
i' m headed off for the park if you' d like to join me .
it' s a beautiful morning .
you' il be working , won' t you ?
perhaps , yes .
i' il let you to your work then .
morning , mr barrie .
morning , emma .
have a good day , sir .
and you .
that' s it .
go on , boy .
go get it , boy .
that' s right .
good boy .
grab it .
good .
who do you belong to ?
come on , boy .
come on .
excuse me , sir , you' re standing on my sleeve .
am i ?
so sorry .
i might point out you' re lying under my bench .
i have to , i' m afraid .
i' ve been put in a dungeon by the evil prince george .
i' m sorry if it bothers you .
well , if you' re trapped in the dungeon , there isn' t much to be done now , is there ?
perhaps i could slide a key to you through the bars .
i wouldn' t risk it , sir .
the evil prince george has tortured many men .
i' m sorry .
is he bothering you , sir ?
my brother can be an extremely irritating sort of person .
aha , prince george , i gather .
i understand you are the horrible tyrant who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch .
i' m not horrible really , but a firm ruler , yes .
kind and tolerant .
and what precisely is ...
what did you say your name was ?
michael .
what precisely is michael' s crime ?
he' s my younger brother .
ah .
fair enough .
sorry , lad .
cannot free you .
that' s all right .
do you mind us playing with your dog ?
no .
go on .
this is jack , second in line to the throne and that one' s michael .
he' s only five .
and i' m in prison for it .
i' m so sorry .
are my boys bothering you ?
we' re not bothering him , mum .
michael , darling , come out from under there .
i can' t .
i' m in prison .
oh , i see .
jm barrie .
pleased to meet you .
jm barrie , the author ?
a pleasure .
sylvia llewelyn davies .
are you a writer ?
i am .
he' s a playwright , jack .
quite a famous one , at that .
i apologize .
i imagine you' re writing .
no .
not at all .
where' s peter ?
what have you written , mr barrie ?
well , currently , i make my living entertaining princes and their courts with my trained bear , porthos .
if you command your brother , peter , to join us ,
i am willing , prince george , to give you just such a performance in exchange for the freedom of this prisoner , of course .
very well .
very well .
now ...
i want you to pay particular attention to the teeth .
some unscrupulous trainers will show you a bear whose teeth have all been pulled , while other cowards will force the brute into a muzzle .
only the true master would attempt these tricks without either measure of safety .
what did you bring me over here for ?
peter .
this is absurd .
it' s just a dog .
come on , darling .
just a dog " ?
just " ?
porthos , don' t listen to him .
porthos dreams of being a bear and you want to dash those dreams by saying he' s " just a dog " ?
what a horrible , candle snuffing word .
that' s like saying , " he can' t climb that mountain , he' s just a man .
or , " that' s not a diamond , it' s just a rock .
just .
fine then .
turn him into a bear .
if you can .
peter , where are your manners ?
with those eyes , my bonny lad , i' m afraid you' d never see it .
however , with just a wee bit of imagination ,
i can turn around right now and see ... the great bear , porthos .
dance with me .
thank you .
i don' t think i' ve ever seen a performance quite like it .
we' re here every day , and the bear is always more than happy to perform .
well , perhaps we' il see you here tomorrow then .
perhaps .
peter , jump up please , darling .
quick .
bye .
bye .
peter , didn' t you enjoy that ?
i' ve seen better .
well , michael wanted the bear kept prisoner with him , and peter insisted that michael was hardly a prisoner and porthos simply wasn' t a bear at all .
i do very much hope to see them tomorrow .
what' s her name ?
sylvia .
um ...
mrs ... something davies .
llewelyn davies ?
you know her ?
i know who she is , of course .
why , she' s a du maurier , for heaven' s sake .
her father was the artist .
her brother' s the actor .
and there was something ... tragic that happened with her husband .
oh , yes .
he died .
cancer of the jaw , i believe .
that' s horrible .
yes .
apparently , he left her with four boys and no income to speak of .
if it wasn' t for her mother' s help ...
james .
we should have them to dinner .
should we ?
absolutely .
i' ve always wanted to meet madam du maurier .
why , she knows practically everyone there is worth knowing .
what are you writing about ?
oh .
nothing of any great consequence .
i can' t write .
have you ever kept a journal ?
ever tried your hand at writing a play ?
well , then how do you know ?
i know .
that' s all .
i see .
where' s your mother today and the rest of the boys ?
home .
mother' s got a bit of a chest cold .
i' m sure everyone would be happy to see you though .
one afternoon .
i should leave you to your writing .
peter .
i' il see you later then .
why didn' t you tell me , charles ?
you knew it wasn' t any good .
why didn' t you tell me , james ?
you knew it wasn' t any good .
hm ?
i took an extended lease on the theater , keeping the actors on .
i don' t have another play .
i' m sure you will .
won' t you ?
we' il see .
i need you to sign for the storage , mr frohman .
lower .
easy does it .
take your time .
it was never meant to be taken seriously .
you know what happened , james ?
they changed it .
they changed what ?
the critics .
they made it important .
hm ?
what' s it called ?
what' s it called ?
" play . " " play .
bang , bang , bang !
bang !
return the boy to us , you nasty injun .
our people teach boy indian ways , make him great warrior .
our chief , running nose , never let him go .
bang , bang , bang !
me wounded , peter .
time' s short .
you go .
spread wings and soar like eagle above enemy .
fly back to our chief .
tell her of my brave defeat .
that' s crazy .
indians can' t fly .
of course they can .
go on , go on , go on .
listen to us , boy .
this injun kidnapped you .
not true .
we kidnap no one .
you lost boy .
i teach you ways of the brave .
i take you as my own son .
you are not my father .
bang , bang , bang , bang !
i' ve got him !
let me go !
stop it , you two .
ooh , we are awful , aren' t we ?
i' m warning you .
oh , i' m scared .
of course , you had a bit of fun for a change .
stop it , you two .
get off !
don' t .
jack !
stop it !
get off , george !
peter .
i' m terribly sorry .
no , it wasn' t your fault .
i' m afraid it might have been .
to be honest , i' m just happy you got him to join in the game .
oh , yes , i was a tremendous success .
mr barrie , it' s more than i' ve been able to achieve .
peter' s a different boy since his father died .
you know , i don' t think he' s even had a good cry about it .
well , grief affects us all in different ways , doesn' t it ?
yes , it does .
oh , by the way , my wife would like to invite you and the boys over to dinner .
your mother as well .
oh .
how kind .
that would be lovely .
well ...
don' t you all look lovely in your little suits ?
and , mrs du maurier , what a shame it is that we' ve not met until this evening .
how kind of you to say so .
not at all .
i can' t tell you how many times i' ve been to a charity or a social event and seen your name listed among the organizers .
it' s the very thing i would love to do myself if i could just find the time .
my problem is in finding the time to do everything else .
at the moment i am running two households .
sylvia believes she can get by without a housekeeper .
mother .
my house is quite large enough for us all ,
but the idea of living with me seems ...
not now , please , mother .
we help her keep the house in order .
don' t interrupt , george .
where did you get your manners ?
sorry , grandmother .
mr barrie , i understand you' ve become playmates of my grandchildren .
oh , they indulge me , really .
on the contrary .
the other day we took to an exploration of darkest africa in our garden .
but mr barrie was taken ill by the bite of a ...
what was it ?
tsetse fly .
quite horrible .
yes , and he swelled to the size of a hippopotamus .
fingers like sausages .
and we had to float in him down the river like he was a great bloated raft .
but the fishing was good , wasn' t it ?
james .
please .
bye .
thank you so much .
lovely evening .
thank you .
bye .
good night .
good night .
well , that was a disaster .
painful .
utterly painful to see .
i don' t know what you mean .
i had a lovely time .
oh , james , please .
my problem is in finding the time to do everything else .
i never felt so judged in my life .
judged ?
how do you mean ?
a grown man , for heaven' s sake , playing all day long with children ?
in any case , i hardly think they' il be the social contact we' d hoped for .
i hadn' t really thought of them that way .
i just enjoy their company .
he' s been a good friend to us , mother .
yes .
but what does that mean ?
hm ?
surely you don' t intend ... ... to keep spending your afternoons with those children , do you ?
and so today , ladies and gentlemen , using only the wind and his own physical strength ,
george llewelyn davies shall test the very limits of the atmosphere using his tethered craft .
go on , boy .
go on , george .
you' re going to break it , george .
george , stop !
i just need a bit more speed .
i want to do it .
hold off a bit , george .
i think it' s in need of a tail .
oh , wait .
here .
james , this will do .
that' s a good idea .
no , it' s not heavy enough .
i want to do it .
you coming , peter ?
porthos !
it' il work this time .
porthos , give us your bell .
that' s good .
michael ?
yeah ?
now , would you like to give it a go ?
yes , please .
oh , he can' t run fast enough .
of course he can .
let him try , jack .
now , george , you hold the kite .
george .
come on , boys , let' s go back up to the top .
come on , peter .
right , george , hold it up .
darling , you' ve got to run now .
ready ?
ready ?
run !
run , michael !
run !
oh .
oh , i told you this wasn' t going to work .
i don' t think he' s fast enough .
it' s not going to work if no one believes in him .
now , give him a chance .
michael , go back to your starting position .
come on , darling , try again .
george , you take the kite .
now this time , i don' t want a flea' s breath of doubt .
we must get that kite in the air .
right .
look , i think i feel a bit more breeze .
are you ready , michael ?
you can do it , michael .
you' ve got to run .
run , michael , run .
run !
that' s it !
yes !
he did it !
keep running !
keep running !
what are you writing about now ?
oh , just making notes .
i' m never really certain what they' re about until i' ve read them over later .
something about the kite ?
now , why do you ask that ?
i don' t know .
if i were a writer i think i could tell a whole story about flying the kite today .
perhaps you should then .
that' s a fantastic idea .
why not give it a try ?
i hope you haven' t been talking about anything too serious with this one .
no .
talking a bit of silliness really .
can we have him for supper ?
have him to stay for supper , michael .
we' re not cannibals .
you are welcome , you know .
sylvia .
mr barrie .
where have you been ?
flying a kite , mother , and having a wonderful time .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t know you were coming this evening .
no ?
well , apparently you forgot then .
i brought some supper along for us all .
you didn' t need to do that .
well , there' s no food in the house , is there ?
really .
you don' t need to wait till the cupboard is bare .
please , mother .
come on , darlings .
wipe feet .
there' s been enough tracking round here .
george , i thought you said you were going to help your mother take care of the house .
coat , michael , please .
yes .
and ... coat hanger .
good .
will we see you tomorrow ?
no .
you' re going to be helping round the house tomorrow .
mother , there is absolutely no need for this .
you can' t do everything yourself .
look at you .
you' re horribly flush .
you' re wearing yourself out .
thank you for a lovely day , james .
excuse me , mother .
so from tomorrow , we' re going to have some discipline around here .
and not one of you will escape .
good evening , mr barrie .
good evening , sarah .
good evening , mr barrie .
good evening , emma .
you missed supper .
perhaps i' il have something later .
i have a bit of writing i wanted to do .
are you sure ?
it was a lovely meal .
duck .
sarah let ema cook this evening .
is that right ?
listen , what would you think of loaning ema out to the davies for the occasional evening ?
they don' t actually have a cook .
i take it mrs davies enjoyed the meal that she had here ?
i imagine she could use an extra hand now and again .
that' s all .
that' s very charitable of you .
perhaps we can send over some of the silver as well .
and what about linen ?
i wouldn' t be surprised if some of hers was looking a bit shabby .
please , mary , stop .
maybe she can send over some of the things we' ve run short on .
my husband , for example .
we rarely see him in this house .
that hasn' t seemed to bother you for some time now .
lords and ladies , his royal highness , king michael the benevolent , protector of the realm .
that scepter' s made of wood .
yes , well , we dream on a budget here , don' t we ?
no , i mean , everyone thinks it' s made of gold , but it' s just an old hunk of wood .
the means to an end , peter .
what we' ve done is taken an old hunk of wood and transformed it for all the world to see into the most magnificent gold .
there you go .
what' s this ?
all great writers begin with a good leather binding and a respectable title .
open it .
the boy castaways .
being a record of the terrible adventures of the brothers davies , faithfully set forth by ...
peter llewelyn davies .
kipling would swallow his own ear for a title like that .
stab him , george .
you can do it .
i still have no idea what to write .
write about anything .
write about your family .
write about the talking whale .
what whale ?
the one that' s trapped in your imagination and desperate to get out .
come sit down .
i have actually begun writing about the adventures of the davies brothers myself .
a play ?
a play indeed , yes .
and i would be extremely honored if you would allow me the use of your name for one of the characters .
i don' t know what to say .
say yes .
good man .
porthos !
that' s mine .
let go .
i won' t go to bed .
i won' t , i won' t .
you should have been in bed half an hour ago , young man .
i' m afraid i' ve grown hopelessly lax in my discipline .
nonsense .
young boys should never be sent to bed .
they always wake up a day older .
and then , before you know it , they' re grown .
their father would have been horrified .
of course , he never would have allowed a dog in the house either .
he' d have tied him up in the yard .
right !
last one in bed' s a hairy toad .
you mean a lot to my boys , you know .
especially peter .
it seems to me that peter' s trying to grow up too fast .
i imagine he thinks that grown ups don' t hurt as deeply as children do when they ... when they lose someone .
i lost my elder brother , david , when i was just peter' s age .
and it nearly destroyed my mother .
james , i' m so sorry .
your poor mother .
i can' t imagine losing a child .
aye .
she didn' t get out of bed for months .
she wouldn' t eat .
i tried everything to make her happy , but ... she only wanted david .
so ... one day ...
i dressed myself in david' s clothing and i went to her .
you must have frightened her to death .
i think it was the first time she ever actually ... looked at me .
and that was the end of the boy james .
i used to say to myself he' d gone to neverland .
where ?
neverland .
it' s a wonderful place .
i' ve not spoken about this before to anyone .
ever .
what' s it like ...
neverland ?
one day i' il take you there .
wait a minute , james .
he' s a fairy ?
er , no .
he' s the irrepressible spirit of youth .
tinker bell is the fairy .
tinker bell is a woman ?
she' s not a woman .
she' s a fairy .
he is a boy who stays young forever .
james , how does anyone stay young forever ?
it doesn' t work .
he just believes , charles .
he imagines life the way he wants it to be , and he believes in it long enough and hard enough that it all appears before him , see ?
james , i' m your friend .
you' re coming off a flop .
you have a man who is a fairy .
no , a boy who has a fairy .
and this girl calls herself tinker .
and you have a pirate ship on stage surrounded by tons and tons of water .
that' s a lot of water .
it' s a lot of water .
yes , and that' s a lot of money .
it is , but we can fake the water .
oh , well , if we can fake the water then i' m sure your play will be a hit .
you know what i think i' il do ?
i think i' il imagine life the way i want it to be ...
long enough and hard enough ?
yes , and then the money for the play will appear magically before me .
that' s right .
that' s it .
yes .
how does the clock wind up inside the crocodile ?
he swallows it .
ah , of course he does .
out !
how was he ?
well done .
good show !
i finally get the courage to invite the boys to a game and we have to suffer this grave humiliation .
it' s perfect actually .
spend a good deal of time with them , don' t you ?
every moment i can spare , in fact .
i' m glad for you .
and mrs davies seems to be having a good time of it as well .
you should be aware though , james , what some people have been saying .
mind you , i wouldn' t bring it up if i thought the rumors would pass .
i' m not surprised .
what are they saying ?
very well .
that you spend much more time with mrs davies than you do with your own wife .
she' s a widow .
and ...
and a friend .
that' s it .
nothing more .
there have also been questions about how you spend your time with those boys .
and why .
that' s outrageous .
how could anyone think something so evil ?
they' re children .
they' re innocent children .
you find a glimmer of happiness in this world , there' s always someone who wants to destroy it .
no .
thank you , arthur , but i don' t think many will give credence to such nonsense .
then why is no one sitting with them ?
once you get a bit of notoriety , james , people watch you and they will look for ways to drag you down .
are you sure your wife doesn' t object to us taking over your cottage for the summer , james ?
she doesn' t go there anymore .
really ?
it' s such a relief to get away .
you' il come and visit , i hope ?
of course .
are we in ?
everyone in ?
can i drive , uncle jim ?
er , no .
out of the way or i' il make haggis out of you .
get the sheep out the way .
are we there yet ?
almost .
almost there .
i can see the cottage !
shall we explore , michael ?
don' t tear your clothes , please .
come on .
follow me .
be careful of stinging nettles .
hurry up , everyone .
would you like to see the rest of it ?
mm .
yes .
' ello !
thought you could escape from captain swarthy , eh ?
off to the ship with you , then .
off to the ship , son !
so now you can either choose to become a pirate with the rest of us , or we' il toss you to the sharks .
how marvelous .
well , maybe the crocodiles , eh ?
no one' s escaped , captain .
excellent work , matey .
now then .
now is your only chance to speak .
who amongst you is ready to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea ?
i am !
not finished yet .
to enter upon the most dangerous chapter in your young and soon to be wasted lives ?
what did you say ?
what are doing , son ?
are you giggling ?
on my ship ?
giggling ?
what did you say ?
i said i' m ready , captain .
what' s your name , boy ?
i' m curly , the oldest and wisest of the crew .
cut him loose , matey .
welcome aboard , curly .
your job will be to mop the deck .
and who be you , young squire ?
my name be nibs the cut throat .
feared by men and greatly desired by the ladies .
jack !
welcome aboard , nibs .
you shall polish all wood surfaces .
grab a hold of that rigging .
and you , lad ?
i' m peter .
that' s not a pirate name .
what about dastardly jim , eh ?
no .
just peter .
i like my name .
very well .
in punishment for lack of an interesting pirate name , peter shall walk the plank .
cut him loose .
what are you playing again ?
the boy .
what have you got ... ?
excuse me .
mr barrie , sir ?
there' s been a mistake here , sir .
it says here i' m to play the nanny .
i don' t imagine i quite fit that part , eh ?
you' re not actually the nanny .
you' re a dog .
what ?
a newfoundland .
we' il put you in a great big fluffy dog suit .
rrr .
oh , right .
actually , we don' t have a tinker bell cast , do we ?
he could play tinker bell .
heavens , no .
tinker bell' s a light .
it moves around the stage .
just a wee light that moves around the stage .
bit worried about this .
let' s see .
we' ve got john darling , michael darling ,
tiger lily , smee , skylights .
it' s a play for puppets .
tootles , nibs , curly .
all these names are absurd when you see them all together .
captain hook , s ...
oh , hello , james .
you' re out of your mind .
how were rehearsals ?
fine .
great .
they' re going ... quite well .
good .
yes .
thank you .
hello .
hello .
how was your journey ?
it was quite long .
i' m exhausted .
let' s get you some tea .
that' d be nice .
thanks .
can you come to the playhouse ?
in a moment , michael .
he' s just arrived .
but i said i' d get him .
they always send peter to do things .
i said i' il do it .
it will spoil the surprise .
what surprise , darling ?
it' s a great surprise .
we' ve taken most of the day preparing for it .
everybody' s waiting for you .
then we mustn' t keep them waiting .
please don' t tell them that i told you the surprise .
i said i wouldn' t .
oh , well , you didn' t really tell us anything about it , did you ?
yes i did .
it' s a play .
it' s a play ?
the lamentable tale of lady ursula .
a play in one act by peter llewelyn davies .
this is just a bit of silliness , really .
i should hope so .
go on .
i just wanted to take a stab at writing , you know .
well , the others do a good job with it anyway .
well , let' s see it then .
the lamentable tale of lady ursula .
one morning , just after sunrise ,
lady ursula , the most beautiful daughter of lord and lady dubon , made her way up the steps of the great cathedral to pray to her blessed saint .
suddenly , as she reached the cathedral doors , the gargoyle that guarded the sacred structure came to life and swooped down upon her .
the people of the village all ran to safety , but lady ursula slipped on the cathedral steps and the gargoyle descended upon her , wrapping her in its huge wings and taking her high up into the spires of the cathedral .
go on , peter .
" not long after this sorrowful event , a young knight named jm barnaby came into the city .
sylvia .
do you want some water ?
mother ?
no , james .
let' s get her back to the house .
go on .
she won' t discuss it with me at all .
she claims it was nothing .
i tell you , doctor , she couldn' t breathe .
you can' t very well treat a patient who won' t admit there' s anything wrong .
well , you' il have to make her understand that something is .
i' il try and do my best .
great .
just there .
get your hand flat like that .
ow .
then ...
like that .
come in .
the good doctor didn' t feel up to the challenge on this one .
he thinks you need to go to hospital for further tests .
nonsense .
when would i have time for that ?
besides , this family' s had enough of hospitals .
perhaps they can help you .
i know what they can do for me .
i saw what they did for my husband .
no , james .
i' ve no interest in hospitals .
i' m keenly interested in having some supper .
what did you and mother decide to tell us this time ?
it' s only a chest cold " ?
we hadn' t decided anything .
stop lying to me !
i' m sick of grown ups lying to me .
i' m not lying to you .
i don' t know what' s wrong .
father might take us fishing , " that' s what she said .
in just a few weeks .
and he died the next morning .
that wasn' t a lie , peter .
that was your mother' s hope .
he barely moved for a week , but i started planning our fishing trip .
i will never lie to you .
i promise you that .
no , all you' il do is teach me to make up stupid stories and pretend that things aren' t happening until ...
i won' t !
i' m not blind .
i won' t be made a fool .
what' s this ?
peter .
the play .
darling , i wanted to see the rest of it .
magic' s gone out of it a bit now , hasn' t it ?
all because of a silly chest cold .
james .
well , you remember gilbert cannan , don' t you ?
good evening .
mr cannan has been working on the committee to fight government censorship .
i know how involved you' ve been as well .
he wanted to speak to you .
i did think you' d be home so much sooner .
it' s been a long evening , mary .
yes .
well , if i' d realized how late it was , of course .
i should perhaps talk to you at another time ?
not so late ?
that will be fine .
we' il talk then .
thank you for your patience , mrs barrie .
mr barrie .
good night .
night .
well , aren' t you going to speak ?
what would you like me to say ?
curious how late mr cannan stayed , " i suppose .
and then , let' s see .
what comes next ?
no later than you were out , james .
and how is mrs davies this evening ?
oh , yes , i would have a great answer for that one , wouldn' t i ?
how dare you .
this isn' t one of your plays .
i know that , mary .
it' s quite serious .
but i' m not ready for this conversation , wherever it may lead .
perhaps we can talk in the morning , yes ?
good night then .
mr barrie .
don' t you agree this is a little bit tight ?
no .
no , in fact i think it' s quite ... baggy .
baggy ?
quite frumpy .
i' d bring it right in just there .
that' s very tight .
and put maybe a plank of wood there to straighten him up .
oh , aye .
yes , mr barrie .
plank of wood ?
some wood there on the shoulders as well .
otherwise , it' s marvelous .
right , sir .
you' il be sick tomorrow .
i' il be sick tonight .
james .
we' re just having some tea .
you remember my mother , of course .
yes .
of course .
how do you do ?
may i take your hat ?
that' s enough , boys .
boys , please don' t run in the house .
you' il break something .
come away from that door .
come on , come on .
i' d like a word with you , mr barrie , before you go .
we' il only be a few minutes .
boys , why don' t you go and play in the garden ?
go on .
is he in trouble ?
sh .
because i' ve been alone with grandmother and i know what it' s like .
should we retire into the study ?
why don' t you join them , dear ?
very well .
i do apologize for interrupting .
would you close the door , please ?
certainly .
sylvia has told me you have offered her the services of your household staff .
well , not exactly .
that won' t be necessary .
i' il leave that to sylvia , of course .
you' il leave that to me , mr barrie .
you see , i' m moving in here from now on .
you' re moving in ?
i' m going where i' m most needed .
and i can certainly see to it that this house is managed without resorting to your charity .
it isn' t charity , mrs du maurier .
i was only trying to help , as a friend .
have you no idea how much your friendship has already cost my daughter ?
or are you really that selfish ?
i beg your pardon ?
don' t you see what a visit to the summer cottage of a married man does for a widow' s future prospects ?
sylvia needs to find someone .
the boys need a father .
and you are destroying any hope this family has of pulling itself together again .
i have only wanted good things for this family , mrs du maurier .
i' il look after them .
you have your own family to concern yourself with .
what are you suggesting ?
i' m suggesting that you protect what you have , mr barrie .
that is precisely what i am doing .
i was so certain what i would find in this .
some little confession would leak out onto the page .
i don' t write love notes in my journal .
no .
still , you knew who i meant , didn' t you ?
that' s some comfort , actually .
it means i know you just a little after all .
you needn' t steal my journal to get to know me , mary .
no .
i suppose i could just go see the plays .
i was hopelessly naive when i married you .
i imagined that brilliant people disappeared to some secret place where good ideas floated around like leaves in autumn .
and i hoped , at least once ... you would take me there with you .
there is no such place .
yes , there is .
neverland .
it' s the best you' ve written , james .
and i' m sure the davies will adore the world you' ve created for them .
i only wish i were part of it .
i' ve wanted you to be .
i' ve tried .
mary .
i always imagined us going off on great adventures once we were together .
but we moved into this house and you started , i don' t know ,
you started rearranging the furniture .
what was i supposed to do , james ?
you were always gone .
i was right here .
sitting in your parlor , staring off into other worlds as though i didn' t exist .
look .
just give me bit more time to finish up the play .
to spend with your muse ?
no , i' m tired of waiting , james .
i' m tired of looking like a fool .
well , i can' t very well give up the play .
of course not .
just come home to me at the end of the day .
rehearse and be home for dinner .
no more trips to the country , no more long afternoons in the park .
if you can' t give us that much of a chance , then we must end this .
and i will .
pitiful display .
nanny .
nanny .
what ?
first you get the pajamas , then you make the bed .
with my paws ?
you make the bed with your paws .
the pajamas you get with your teeth .
because in fact , being a dog , you haven' t any proper digits , have you ?
well , i don' t have any teeth , either .
i mean , i can' t see .
i can' t breathe .
all i' ve got is this rubbery snout .
can we get him some teeth ?
he can have mine .
we' il get you teeth .
let' s have a wee break , shall we ?
right .
i thought you were wonderful .
you were marvelous .
i think you' re better on four legs than you are on two .
oh , give it a rest .
i do .
just say it , charles , go on .
well , you picture it , james .
opening night , doctors , lawyers , businessmen and their wives , all dressed to the nines .
they' ve paid good money , they' re expecting theater , what we call theater .
the curtain opens and it' s crocodiles and fairies and pirates and indians .
i don' t even know what it is .
but you did know , charles .
you' re an absolute genius , charles .
that' s it .
oh , don' t patronize me , james .
you know how much money i put into this show that i haven' t even found yet ?
listen , listen .
opening night , i want 25 seats set aside .
set aside ?
25 ?
25 seats .
scattered throughout the theater .
two here , two there , three up there .
are they paying for it ?
they' re filled .
no , no , no .
i' m asking ...
the seats are filled .
uncle jim ?
hello , boys .
could i speak to you for a moment , please ?
certainly .
25 seats , charles .
it' il be great .
it' il be fantastic .
25 scattered seats ?
who' s paying for them ?
throughout the theater .
who' s paying for these 25 seats ?
they' re filled up seats , charles .
whoa .
look .
this is great .
i' m flying .
we don' t need to use much pull at all , see ?
as long as we' ve got the balance down .
mother asked me to take the boys out for the afternoon .
she said she only wanted a bit of quiet , but she was trembling so badly she couldn' t even finish her tea .
i' m not a fool , uncle james .
i deserve to know the truth .
i don' t know the truth .
she won' t talk about it .
but you think it' s serious ?
it could be .
the doctor felt she should go and have some tests .
then you' il have to convince her to go then .
i' ve tried .
she won' t listen to me .
and lately , to be quite honest , it seems that all my best intentions for your family have come to nothing but harm .
apparently i' ve made quite a mess of things .
it' s grandmother , isn' t it ?
she' s run you off , hasn' t she ?
oh , she' s absolutely tried with great effort .
and perhaps with good reason .
it isn' t you , uncle jim .
she just ...
she just doesn' t want to see mother hurt anymore .
look at that .
how magnificent .
the boy' s gone .
somewhere during the last 30 seconds , you' ve become a grown up .
right then .
i think you should be the one to talk to her , george .
but i wouldn' t know what to say .
you' il do fine .
you' il do just fine .
mr barrie , sir .
sorry to interrupt .
it' s nana , he' s expired backstage .
what' s happened ?
i think his costume is too tight .
it' s not possible , too tight .
george , give me a minute , i' il be back .
pull that one tight .
here , last one .
ok .
flap those wings .
there you go .
whoa !
can i have a go ?
yeah , you can have a little go if you want .
give that a tug .
go on .
just give it a little pull .
can i have a go ?
in a minute .
in a minute .
can i have a go ?
jack .
pull me higher .
i have to concentrate .
stop it now , boys .
no , michael .
stop mucking about , boys .
come on now .
i want to do it now .
no , don' t go down there .
what are you ... ?
ow !
oh , no .
oh , no , i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
george ?
mr barrie ?
mrs davies would like a word with you .
no , just mr barrie .
did you encourage this ?
encourage what ?
oh , james , please .
you know perfectly well what .
george won' t allow them to set his arm unless i submit to an examination .
i see .
well , i suppose you' il have to then , because he' s quite a stubborn young man when he sets his mind to it .
this is absurd .
they won' t tell me anything different .
different ?
so you' ve already spoken to a doctor then ?
that is not your concern .
my understanding is that my condition may be quite serious .
however ... my wish is that life should go on as normal .
so ,
i' il have the examination , and i' il take whatever medications they advise .
but i don' t want to know what they' re for .
and i don' t want you inquiring into it any further .
wouldn' t dream of it .
mary ?
mary ?
peter , could you help george to fold a pocket handkerchief , please ?
they' re in the linen cupboard .
darling ?
yes , mother .
jack , how do you manage to always come untucked ?
would you check your shirt tails in the intermission , please ?
yes , mother .
you' re not planning on attending any after theater events , are you ?
only for a short time if we do .
the tickets !
with the children ?
george !
um , possibly .
would you see if george has the tickets , please ?
i' il just check the dressing table .
sylvia , there' s a ...
mother , please see if george has the tickets .
michael , where are your socks ?
wait here , don' t move .
take her feet , george .
we' il need some more blankets .
oh , take michael with you , would you ?
she looks much worse than when we were at the cottage .
sh , michael .
those 25 seats , has anyone shown up ?
no , sir .
not yet .
precisely .
have there been many people asking for seats ?
yes , sir .
charles .
i suggest you start selling them .
yes , james ?
have you seen any of the davies family yet this evening ?
the 25 seats , are they filled ?
it' s taken care of .
yes .
yes .
who did you invite ?
because obviously whoever you invited decided not to come .
the seats will be filled , i promise .
yes .
you' ve been promising me all ...
charles ?
hello , mr stanley .
have you seen the davies family this evening ?
no , sir .
jack has gone to get dr brighton .
oh , no , mother .
i don' t need a doctor .
yes , you do , dear .
i think i' il get some chamomile to help you relax .
peter will be here if you need anything .
peter .
peter .
can i do anything , mother ?
no , darling .
you must go to the play .
i can' t do that .
yes , you can .
i need you to .
i need you to come back tonight and tell me every bit of it .
please .
it' s only a play , mother .
it doesn' t matter .
what do you want ?
take it out .
open it .
i' ve never been so proud of you .
last call , please , ladies and gentlemen .
last call .
yes , yes , yes .
it' s all right .
they know .
we had time to sell those 25 seats .
the play' s starting .
charles .
what ?
they' re here .
who' s here ?
do forgive them being a bit late short legs , long walk from the orphanage .
i' m not clear what they' re doing here .
they' ve come to see the play .
mm hm .
that' s the 25 seats .
mm .
25 seats given to orphans .
right .
now my nightmare is complete .
you can start your play now .
your play .
get them in the scattered seats .
just there , boys .
excuse me , sir .
this way .
thank you .
looks like we got one of the better dressed ones .
i just want you to know , i think you' re a wonderful dog .
thanks .
i won' t go to bed .
i won' t .
i won' t .
nana , it isn' t six o' clock yet .
two minutes more .
please .
one minute more .
nana , i will not be bathed .
i tell you , i will not be bathed .
who are you ?
no one there .
yet i feel sure i saw a face .
my children .
how is she ?
she' s resting .
may i see her ?
no , mr barrie .
i don' t think we need to include you in everything that goes on in this household .
but she' d want to see him .
be quiet , george .
and since , as i' ve discovered , you' ve seen fit to conceal certain facts about my daughter' s condition from me ,
i feel no remorse at excluding you from my home .
but you can' t ...
go upstairs , george , now .
stop ordering me about .
this isn' t your home .
it' s our home .
just cos mother' s needed your help recently doesn' t give you the right to rule over her existence .
she' s not a child anymore , and neither am i.
if she wants to see uncle jim , she can see uncle jim .
there' s nothing you can do about it .
mother ?
yes , darling ?
james .
no .
your play .
look at all this .
i' d have come tonight , it' s just ...
mother , you need to rest . ...
i still have things to do here .
see ?
this needs mending .
four boys , no end of patches .
can' t seem to keep up .
i haven' t the time for all this .
don' t look at me like that , james .
you make me feel so utterly exposed .
boys , would you give me a moment with your mother , please ?
thank you .
they can see it , you know .
you can' t go on just pretending .
just pretending " ?
you brought pretending into this family , james .
you showed us we can change things by simply believing them to be different .
a lot of things , sylvia , not everything .
but the things that matter .
we' ve pretended for some time now that you' re a part of this family , haven' t we ?
you' ve come to mean so much to us all that now it doesn' t matter if it' s true .
and even if it isn' t true , even if that can never be ...
i need to go on pretending .
until the end .
with you .
oh , i am sweet .
how do you do it ?
you just think lovely , wonderful thoughts and they lift you up in the air .
you are so nippy at it .
couldn' t you do it very slowly once ?
yes , i' ve got it now , wendy .
i must blow fairy dust on you first .
now try .
try it from the beds .
just wriggle your shoulders like this and then let go .
i flew !
how ripping !
now join hands .
look at me !
i do like it !
bravo !
let' s go out .
second on the right and straight on till morning .
genius .
sylvia , don' t move .
i feel a little better .
it' s been a bad day , that' s all .
now i want you to go back to the theater .
find peter .
of course .
thank you .
are you sure there' s nothing else i can do for you ?
no .
well ,
i have always wanted to go to neverland .
you did promise to tell me about it , you know .
aye .
that i did .
it' s a bit late for it tonight though , i' m afraid .
perhaps some time soon though ?
most definitely .
d' you mean we shall both be drowned ?
look how the water is rising .
it must be the tail of the kite we made for michael .
you remember .
it tore itself out of his hands and floated away .
the kite .
why shouldn' t it carry you ?
both of us .
it can' t lift two .
michael and curly tried .
i won' t go without you , peter .
let us draw lots which is to stay behind .
and you a lady ?
never .
ready , wendy ?
peter !
don' t let go , wendy .
peter , i' m frightened .
hang on , wendy !
peter !
to die will be an awfully big adventure .
i' m glad you came .
well ...
i' ve never missed an opening .
so i ... assume you heard about gilbert and i.
yes .
quite the scandal , so i' m told .
how are you ?
i' m all right .
how are you ?
i' m sorry .
don' t be .
without that family , you could never have written anything like this .
you need them .
goodbye .
mr barrie .
mrs snow .
thank you .
that was quite the nicest evening i' ve ever spent in the theater .
very kind of you to say .
thank you .
where' s mr snow this evening ?
oh .
i' m afraid he' s left us .
and he would so have loved this evening .
the pirates and the indians .
he was really just a boy himself , you know .
to the very end .
i' m terribly sorry .
how are you doing ?
i' m doing well enough now , thank you .
i suppose it' s all the work of the ticking crocodile , isn' t it ?
time is chasing after all of us .
isn' t that right ?
that' s right , mrs snow .
aunt rose , your drink .
thank you .
i mustn' t keep you .
you' ve a lot of friends here .
well , it' s lovely to see you .
i' m terribly sorry , once again .
was that mr barrie ?
that was mr barrie .
well done , mr barrie .
good show .
well done .
psst .
what did you think ?
it' s about our summer together , isn' t it ?
it is .
about all of us .
that' s right .
did you like it ?
it' s magical .
thank you .
oh , thank you .
thank you , peter .
this is peter pan !
how wonderful .
really ?
you' re peter pan ?
why , you must be quite the little adventurer .
look , it' s true .
he has no shadow .
but i' m not peter pan .
he is .
and there' s been no improvement since my last visit ?
no .
has james been by at all today , mother ?
dr brighton .
may i have a word ?
excuse me a moment .
you haven' t been keeping him from me , have you ?
as a matter of fact , i actually hoped he might come .
would have proved me wrong about him .
of course , with the success of his play , the whole of london must be knocking at his door .
i' m sorry , dear .
what is it ?
it' s a secret .
quiet , michael .
i didn' t say anything .
mother , could you come downstairs for a moment ?
oh , she can' t come downstairs .
what are you thinking of , george ?
actually , i think a trip downstairs might do her good , ma' am .
what have you been up to ?
just wait and see .
it' s a play .
it' s not just a play , michael .
it' s the play .
of course , we' il have to make do with a few compromises .
much of it will have to be imagined .
as it should be .
as it should be , that' s right .
michael , come and sit here , next to mum .
when you' re ready .
i won' t go to bed .
i won' t .
i won' t .
nana , it isn' t six o' clock yet .
two minutes more .
please .
you know fairies , peter ?
yes .
but they' re nearly all dead now .
you see , wendy , when the first baby laughed for the first time , the laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about and that was the beginning of fairies .
and now when every new baby is born , its first laugh becomes a fairy .
so there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl .
ought to be ?
isn' t there ?
oh , no .
children know such a lot now .
soon , they don' t believe in fairies .
and every time a child says , " i don' t believe in fairies , " there' s a fairy somewhere that falls down dead .
who is that ?
the redskins were defeated ?
wendy and the boys captured by the pirates ?
i' il rescue her .
i' il rescue her !
oh , that' s just my medicine .
poisoned ?
who could have poisoned it ?
why , tink .
you' ve drunk my medicine .
it was poisoned .
and you drank it to save my life ?
tink .
are you dying ?
her light is growing faint .
if it goes out , that means she' s dead .
her voice is so low i can scarcely hear what she' s saying .
she says she thinks she could get well again if children believed in fairies .
do you believe in fairies ?
say quick that you believe .
if you believe , clap your hands .
clap louder .
thank you .
thank you .
that is neverland .
so many perfect days .
i really began to believe we' d go on like that forever .
oh , stop it .
she wasn' t going to stay with you forever .
she had a husband .
my father .
she never cared for you the way she did for him .
i' m not trying to replace your father , peter .
i could never do that .
you' d best let him go .
george , would you take the boys back to the house ?
i' il be with you in a moment .
go on , dear .
i' m terribly sorry .
i' ve ruined everything i' ve touched in this family .
stop giving yourself so much credit .
peter' s grieving .
it has nothing to do with you .
perhaps if i just had a bit more time with him .
no , mr barrie .
that won' t be good enough .
if " a bit more time " is all you can provide , you' d better leave him alone .
i know you don' t much care for me , mrs du maurier , and i respect that , but i loved your daughter very much .
and i love those boys .
and i think they need me right now .
is that so ?
and for how long after ?
meaning what ?
sylvia has requested a co guardianship for the boys in her will .
you , mr barrie , and myself .
and what do you have to say about that ?
i shall respect my daughter' s wishes .
something i should have done more of while she was alive .
but if you feel you' re not ready for such a commitment ,
i assure you i can certainly look after the boys by myself .
do you think i could abandon those boys ?
sit down , peter .
mother pasted it back together after i ruined it .
and then i saw the play .
i just started writing and i haven' t been able to stop .
she would be very pleased to know that .
listen .
i' ve just spoken with your grandmother and i' m staying .
for good .
i' m sorry i was so horrible .
don' t worry .
it' s just ...
i thought she' d always be here .
so did i.
but , in fact ... she is .
because she' s on every page of your imagination .
you' il always have her there .
always .
but why did she have to die ?
i don' t know , boy .
when i think of your mother ...
i will always remember how happy she looked sitting there in the parlor , watching a play about her family .
about her boys that never grew up .
she went to neverland .
and you can visit her any time you like if you just go there yourself .
how ?
by believing , peter .
just believe .
i can see her .
