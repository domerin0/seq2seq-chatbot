turn around .
turn around .
turn the car around and get the hell out of here .
right now .
don' t go back .
do not go back there .
hey !
hey !
what the hell' s going on here ?
you stole my story .
well ?
i' m sorry .
do i ... ?
i don' t know you .
i know that .
that doesn' t matter .
i know you , mr. rainey , that' s what matters .
you stole my story .
you' re mistaken .
i don' t read manuscripts .
you read this one already .
you stole it .
i can assure you that i ...
i know you can .
i know that .
i don' t want to be assured .
if you want to talk to someone about some grievance you feel you have ... ... call my literary agent in new york .
this is between you and me .
we don' t need outsiders , mr. rainey .
it is strictly between you and me .
all right , look , mister , whoever you are ... ... i don' t like being accused of plagiarism ... ... if that' s what you' re accusing me of .
chico , inside .
i don' t blame you for not liking it , but you did it .
you stole my story .
leave .
i have nothing more to say .
yeah , i' il go .
we' il talk more later .
i' m not taking that .
won' t do you any good to play games with me , mr. rainey .
this has got to be settled .
so far as i' m concerned , it is .
sowing season .
john shooter .
never heard of you , pal .
never heard of your story .
now ... ... where was i ?
i' m open to suggestions .
if you don' t go and bite her , i' il kill her .
four days after george had confirmed to his satisfaction ... ... that his wife was cheating on him , he confront ...
this is just bad writing .
just bad writing .
so you know what to do .
just do it .
no bad writing .
i think that solves it .
oh , i found one of your stories in the trash , mr. rainey .
i thought you might want it , so i put it on the table .
yeah , i see that , mrs. garvey .
todd downey thought that a woman who would steal your love ... ... when your love was really all you had , was not much of a woman .
he , therefore , decided to kill her .
he would bury her in the deep corner formed ... ... where the house and the barn came together at an extreme angle .
he would bury her where his wife kept her garden .
the garden she loved more than she loved him .
oh , shit .
oh , sh ...
thank god .
from the sound of you , i didn' t know what to think .
let me get this .
that' s my job .
i' m terribly sorry , mrs. garvey .
i really am .
i' il take care of this .
go on back to work .
i didn' t write this .
oh , i thought you did .
no , it' s not mine .
look , it says john shooter right there .
it' s not me .
oh , i thought it was one of those ... ... whatchamacallums , pseudo names or nyms .
no .
no , i never used one .
i' ve never used one .
oh , i can' t imagine why you would .
i mean , hide behind a made up name .
no .
mrs. garvey , what i' m trying to tell you is that someone else wrote this .
oh .
okey dokey , then .
a woman who' d steal your love when your love was all you had ... ... wasn' t much of a woman .
that , at least , was tommy haverlock' s opinion .
he decided to kill her .
he even knew the place he would bury her .
the exact place .
the little patch of garden she kept in the extreme angle ... ... formed where the old and new parts of the house came together .
he' d bury her in the garden she loved more than she loved him .
come to the flea market with me .
it' il be fun .
we' ve got to get rid of some of this stuff .
look at this , it' s awful .
no wonder they left it .
oh , my god , look , there' s a window .
it' s a secret window .
oh , this is perfect .
i' m gonna put my garden right there .
it' s a secret window , and it' il look down on a secret garden .
shit .
i didn' t steal it .
what ?
mr. rainey ?
i' m all done .
really ?
so soon ?
well ... ... i' il see you next time .
mr. rainey ... ... there' s something i want to say .
some women don' t know a good thing when they got it .
they don' t know they got the whole world right in front of their nose .
there .
that' s it .
not another word from me .
mr. rainey ?
can i make you something to eat ?
no .
i ate .
well , earlier .
i' m going to eat later .
and i' il make it myself .
you' re a good man , mr. rainey .
you too , mrs. garvey .
it' s my personal business , mrs. garvey .
thank you very much .
my pillows now .
her sticky , weird fingers on my privacy .
i didn' t steal that story .
i don' t think .
hello ?
hello , mort .
are you all right ?
yeah .
i' m all right .
why wouldn' t i be all right ?
i don' t know .
you' re up there alone .
anything could happen and nobody would know .
i' d know .
right .
how' s my little baby puppy ?
did chico get those cataracts removed ?
why did you call , amy ?
what do you want ?
i had one of those feelings i get .
i know you think they' re stupid and you don' t believe them ... ... but i believe them .
i was making a sandwich and i had a sensation that you might not be okay .
i held off as long as possible .
but then i couldn' t anymore , so here i am .
well , i don' t know what to tell you except i' m fine .
nothing weird happened or anything ?
do you remember secret window ?
what ?
my story .
you know , the one where the woman has the garden ... ... and then the guy has the shovel .
not one of my favorites .
that' s good to know .
well , it was kind of hostile , don' t you think ?
gee , i miss your constructive criticism .
i really do .
what about the story , mort ?
i was just wondering , do you think it' s possible ... ... that i might have been influenced by anybody or anything at that time ?
other than jack daniel' s ?
i know that part , amy , hence the question .
i don' t know .
you got weird on that one .
you' d write it mostly at night , i think .
what do you mean , influenced ?
i don' t know .
like , by another story ?
look , forget it .
mort , you swore the one time was the only time .
forget it , please .
please , just forget it .
come on .
how' s ted ?
he' s fine .
i was thinking that he and i should get together sometime , have a drink ... ... because we' ve been to a lot of the same places .
you know what ?
i gotta go .
so do i.
okay .
is he there ?
no .
we' re not together .
wow , well ... ... i' d be lying if i said i wasn' t on the verge of doing snoopy dances .
no , mort .
what i meant was we' re not together at the moment .
he' s coming over later .
he hardly ever comes here .
i usually go to his house .
there' s a useful detail .
thanks for that .
don' t ask , then .
it was working just fine that way .
i think you should have him over to the house more .
such a nice house .
i like it .
i mean , i love it .
that' s why i bought it .
goodbye , mort .
goodbye , amy .
shit .
shit .
shit .
stupid .
stupid .
stupid .
you read it ?
i did .
i imagine it rang a bell , didn' t it ?
oh , it certainly did .
when did you write it ?
i thought you' d ask that .
that' s the whole point .
two writers have the same story , it' s all about who wrote the words first .
wouldn' t you say that' s true ?
i suppose so .
i suppose that' s why i came all the way up here from mississippi .
i wrote it seven years ago , 1997 .
how' d you get it ?
that' s what i really want to know .
how in the hell did a big money scribbling asshole like you ... ... get down to a little shitsplat town in mississippi ... ... and steal my goddamn story ?
drop it .
drop it ?
drop it .
what in the hell do you mean , drop it ?
you said you wrote your story in 1997 .
i wrote mine in late ' 94 .
it was published for the first time in june 1995 in a magazine .
nice try , mr. shooter , but i beat you by two years .
if anybody' s got a bitch about plagiarism , it' s me .
you lie !
no , i don' t !
prove it !
i don' t have to prove a thing to you .
go look for yourself .
ellery queen' s mystery magazine , june 1995 .
and how am i supposed to find that ?
that' s not my problem .
am i supposed to drive down to your house in riverdale , new york ... ... and ask your wife , amy , for it ?
i read it on your book jacket .
that' s not my house .
that' s hers .
what the hell does that mean ?
what do you think , you ignorant hick ?
i' m in the middle of a divorce .
d i v o r c e. divorce .
you strike me as the kind of guy ... ... who' s on the lookout for a head he can knock off with a shovel .
but what you don' t understand is , if we do start to fight ... ... it' s not going to end ... ... until one or the other of us is dead .
hold your water , i' m just getting my smokes .
i don' t smoke .
i' il give you three days .
call your ex and get her to send you the magazine with your story in it ... ... if there is such a magazine ... ... and i' il be back .
if i show you , will you go back where you came from and leave me alone ?
three days .
always a pleasure to meet a reader .
i don' t want to call her .
i want to go to sleep .
i want to take a nap .
okay .
no nap .
i give her a call about the magazine ... ... i go write some crap for a couple of hours ... ... and then i get to take a nap .
right ?
chico ?
chico
don' t be discouraged
all right , go ahead and be discouraged , you blind bastard .
see if i care .
and returned to the couch ... ... in shame ... ... degradation ...
... and sloth .
sloth .
shooter !
i' il get you for this !
you hear me ?
i' il get you for this !
chico ?
he killed chico ?
yeah .
last night around 9 .
i was asleep .
look , he left this .
you have three days .
i' m not joking .
no police .
anytime somebody sits down and writes no police ... ... that' s exactly the time that a fella should get himself over to the police .
yeah , well , that' s what i figured .
so , what i' ve got is a detailed description of him and his car .
type a little harder .
you have to get through the carbon .
i didn' t get the license plate number ... ... but i' m sure it had mississippi tags , and i think that it started with an a.
that' s what i see in my mind .
needlepoint .
can you believe it ?
doc says it' s good for the arthritis .
anyway , anything you can find out about this guy , i' d appreciate it .
i must cut quite an intimidating law enforcement figure , huh ?
i' d like to know what i' m dealing with .
maybe he has a violent history .
maybe you can find him , talk to him .
i think that would be better .
so you got yourself a member of the crazy folks tribe ?
yeah .
i mean , they pop up every once in a while .
i suppose it' s just the price of selling a few books .
sorry .
here' s the ...
here' s that description .
of course , killing an animal isn' t like killing a man .
i' m not even sure it' s a crime , come to think .
come on , it' s gotta be .
what about animal cruelty ?
what about destruction of private property ?
what about ... ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
maybe .
okay .
first thing i' m going to need is a description .
tell me the truth .
did you steal it ?
what ?
no !
kind of an amazing coincidence , don' t you think ?
the stories being so much alike ?
obviously he copied me .
would you like to choose a side before we go on ?
i' m on your side .
but i still need to know the truth .
which kind of situation is this ?
is he a regular wacko like you' ve had before , in which case i can help ... ... or something you should talk to your lawyer about ?
no , this guy is just simply out of his mind .
that' s all it is .
fine .
okay .
what do you want me to do ?
i want you to help me in the same way that ...
in the same way that you did before .
he wasn' t this crazy .
that guy was just an obsessed reader ... ... who couldn' t tell real life from the crap you make up for a living .
no offense .
now , this shooter guy , he threaten your life ?
he put a screwdriver through my dog .
well , he did break a law ... ... but it doesn' t seem to be a very important law in tashmore lake .
the sheriff must be a cat person .
yeah , well , i don' t exactly feel safe ... ... with a 70 year old arthritic sheriff watching my back .
are you gonna help me or not ?
let' s see ... ... i got a corporate loyalty thing i got to be back for on friday ... ... but i can give you a couple of days .
okay .
my story came out a couple years ... ... before he says he wrote his .
i' ve got a copy of the original at amy' s house .
i was just gonna stop by on my way upstate and pick it up .
amy' s house ?
yeah .
amy and i split up six months ago .
i' m sorry .
yeah , me too .
amicable ?
not remotely .
what happened ?
you finally nail one of your groupies at a book signing ?
the omaha barnes and noble ?
that was a dick thing to say , you know ?
rotten profession .
i apologize .
you were saying ?
i was saying ... ... that if it' s just proof that this guy wants , fine .
i show him the magazine .
but i think maybe you should be with me when i do .
no shit , i' m gonna be with you .
you remember my rate ?
yeah .
an obscene fortune , right ?
you' il see a black cadillac in the driveway tonight when you get home .
don' t freak out , it' s me keeping an eye on things .
okay .
get a good night' s sleep .
you don' t look too hot .
this is not my beautiful house .
this is not my beautiful wife .
anymore .
you scared the shit out of me .
hey , i' m sorry about that .
this last week must have finally caught up with me .
that' s very reassuring .
thanks .
hey , relax , hemingway .
i was only out 10 minutes , swear to god .
already checked the place .
everything is fine .
just waiting for you to get back to let you know .
you think you' il be sticking around tonight , or ... ?
no .
not unless you want me to .
no .
no .
no , i' m sure it' s fine in there .
nope .
no monsters up here .
did you check under my bed ?
even in your toy chest .
i' il be back in the morning .
start asking around town .
what the hell you gonna do with that , sailor ?
find out who else saw your nut job .
tom greenleaf .
tom greenleaf passed by when i was talking to shooter .
he waved at us , so he must have gotten a good look at him .
tom greenleaf .
how do i get ahold of him ?
bowie' s store , breakfast every morning , 9 a . m .
okay , i got it .
don' t worry .
once i find out where this shooter' s staying ... ... i' il stop in for a little freak me out chat .
use the word we a lot .
we know what you' re doing .
we want it to stop .
we' re watching you .
trust me , he' il hit the road so hard , it' il hit back .
hey .
you know what ?
are you staying in town tonight ?
yeah , some motel out by route 9 .
irv' s lakesider , i think it' s called .
you know the place ?
yeah , i know the place .
okay .
good night .
hello ?
shit .
i know you' re in there , shithead !
if you don' t come out by the time i count to five ... ... i' m gonna come in swinging .
one .
two !
i killed a mirror .
and my shower door .
i don' t care .
i' m just gonna smoke .
i' m just gonna totally smoke .
i' il finish these , go to the store ...
i' il finish these , go to the store ... ... get a brand new pack , smoke the shit out of that one .
thought you didn' t smoke .
i took it up recently for my health .
how are you , mr. rainey ?
oh , i' m just peachy , mr. shooter .
how are you ?
well , it sounded like you pitched a fit or something in there .
i don' t think you' re really all that well .
stealing from another man , that don' t seem to have ever bothered you none .
being caught up on , though .
or maybe it' s just that successful writers like you ... ... throw tantrums when things don' t go the way they expect .
why didn' t you get that magazine ?
you were down there at her house today , weren' t you ?
if i get this story and i show it to you ... ... will you then kindly disappear ?
there isn' t any magazine with that story in it , mr. rainey .
you and me , we know that .
okay , then .
what can we do to make you feel better ?
i want you to fix it .
what would you like me to fix ?
my ending .
the one you wrecked .
i can' t decide what' s worse ... ... stealing my story or ruining the ending .
mine was perfect .
i don' t think i read your whole story .
oh , i bet you did .
' i know i can do it , ' todd downey said ... ... helping himself to another ear of corn from the steaming bowl .
' i' m sure that in time ... ... her death will be a mystery even to me . '
that' s how the story ends , pilgrim .
it' s the only ending .
you' re going to write it for me and get it published .
and it' s gonna have my name on it .
i' d be more than happy to write your ending , mr. shooter .
saw that wife of yours coming out of the house .
she' s purty .
my wife ?
why don' t we just leave her out of this .
would if i could ... ... but i' m starting to think you ain' t gonna leave me that option .
you want to wake up from one of your stupid naps ... ... and find amy nailed to your garbage bin ?
or turn on the radio some morning and hear she came off second best ... ... in a match with the chain saw you keep out in the shed ?
do you ?
you can' t get away with it .
i know what you did ... ... and i ain' t quitting until right gets put right .
is that you , john wayne ?
mort ?
are you there ?
mort ?
yes , amy , i' m here .
just lower your voice a little .
what is it ?
where have you been ?
i' ve been trying to get ahold of you all night and this morning .
i was asleep .
oh , great , so you unplugged the phone ?
how may i assist you , amy ?
oh , god , mort .
what happened ?
what ?
someone burned down our house .
that' s what happened , okay ?
what ?
someone burned down our house !
bye , babe .
pardon me , miss .
you left $ 100 on the dresser .
shut up !
surely the escort service told you i was three .
please .
some guys are less , some guys are 100 if you like that kind of thing .
some guys are less than that , but i' m three .
i happen to be three .
there' s something on your mouth there .
bye .
mort !
hi .
hi .
i' m really sorry about all this , amy .
so am i.
me too .
thank you , ted .
mr. and mrs. rainey ?
yes .
you the owners ?
yes , we are .
we were the owners .
were the owners ?
what do you mean ?
you don' t own it anymore ?
were mr. and mrs. rainey .
are the owners .
i' m steven bradley , riverdale p. d. how do you do ?
ted milner .
this is fire chief wickersham .
chief .
we won' t keep you long .
the insurance investigator needs to see you at 3 .
you' re victims of arson .
the fire was started by an incendiary device ... ... made with a champagne bottle and a couple of quarts of gasoline .
oh , that really works , then , eh ?
enemies .
you got any ?
no .
no one .
no , no .
not a soul .
bother you if i answer one or two of these , ted ?
it' s okay .
it' s cool .
yeah .
i have an enemy .
sorry i wasn' t there to meet you this morning .
i spent last night poking around the site with a flashlight and a polaroid .
oops .
broke one of my own rules .
i don' t like to call it the site .
it wasn' t a site , it was a house .
your house , and i' m sorry for your loss .
thank you very much , mrs. evans .
it still says mrs. ?
fran is fine .
these meetings are hard .
people in your situation are already upset ... ... and quite often they see an investigator ... ... as an accusation that they' ve torched their own property .
and in this case , you' ve given us a plausible suspect ... ... who we' il investigate aggressively along with the police .
but in the meantime , that' s a list of your claimed insurable property .
read it and sign an affidavit swearing that the items still belong to you ... ... and that they were inside when the fire occurred .
i' m told there was a separation of residence recently ... ... so that last bit will be important .
we' re going through a divorce .
it' s not final yet .
well , the settlement agreement' s all done .
everything' s been negotiated ... ... we' re just waiting for it to be signed by both parties .
i moved out about six months ago ... ... and just hadn' t gotten around to hauling all the stuff out yet , so ...
been down that road .
sucks .
these things just have to follow their natural course .
things will wrap up when everybody' s ready for that to happen .
that' s been my feeling .
in the meantime , do the best you can with the list .
thanks .
do you actually intend to rubberneck ?
i hardly think my concern could be construed as rubbernecking .
amy , he' s rubbernecking .
i' m not gonna freak out about this , but , i mean , this is our stuff .
no .
all right .
he' s right .
this is our stuff .
he' s right .
he' s right , ted .
he is right .
the law says you have no right to see the listed items at all .
we wink at things like this if nobody minds , but it seems mr. rainey does .
yes .
mr. rainey minds a lot .
would it help matters if i took a walk around the block ?
yes , thanks .
sure .
oh , heck , ted , live a little .
make it two .
rubbernecker .
mort .
wait .
i need to ask you something .
what ?
this guy , shooter .
his story .
i mean , is this situation like the other time ?
i' m sorry .
i wouldn' t bring it up , but it did happen once before .
look , that is the only time i' ve ever done anything remotely like that .
i paid the guy everything he wanted .
never happened before or since .
okay .
okay .
okay .
amy .
what ?
only you , me and the lawyers know about that , right ?
right .
because you haven' t said anything to ted .
surely not .
no .
have you said something to ted ?
come on !
well , do i have timing or what ?
yes , you do .
sorry you had to miss that .
i know how much you like my things .
oh , jesus .
you and me are gonna have a talk .
be back in 10 minutes .
i' m in trouble .
i' ve had enough of your bullshit .
you' re a dick .
do you feel better ?
yes , i do .
yeah , look , marriages end .
i' m sorry , but i didn' t end yours .
it was done by the time i got there .
really ?
you must' ve thought her wedding ring was a little strange .
oh , man .
listen , i apologized to you months ago .
i know you don' t want me in your life .
i don' t want you in mine either .
but until this little divorce thing' s done , not much we can do about it .
but i will not let you upset amy any more than you already have .
so why don' t we just wrap this thing up and get out of each other' s lives ... ?
are we getting the message i' m sending ?
where are we from , teddy ?
tennessee ... ... morty .
i was gonna say mississippi .
no .
long way from there .
little place called shooter' s bay .
come on , karsch .
five hundred dollars a day .
where are you when i need you ?
what ... ?
what fresh hell ... ?
yeah ?
where you been all day ?
i might ask you the same question .
relax , you' re fine .
i checked the cabin an hour ago .
well , he showed up an hour after you left last night .
oh , really ?
then he had a busy night .
my office called me about your riverdale house .
i' m sorry .
the worst part is , i hadn' t had a chance to get the magazine out .
the one with the story he says i stole .
that' s gone up in smoke now .
do you still want to go through with it ?
meeting ?
showing him the magazine ?
hell , yes , man .
i' ve had a shitty year .
i want it settled now .
everything .
good .
i called your agent when i heard about the house .
i figured he' d have a copy of the magazine .
he sent the original by ups overnight today .
you can pick it up tomorrow after 3 .
i knew there was a reason i hired you .
there' s something else .
i caught up with your tom greenleaf today .
the guy who drove past you and shooter on the lake road .
well , he' s a weird one .
first he says he did go down to the lake drive on tuesday ... ... and he saw you like you said .
no , come to think of it , i didn' t .
didn' t see anybody .
wasn' t even on lake drive on tuesday .
yeah , well , tom' s old .
maybe just slipped his mind .
don' t be naive .
he was scared shitless .
somebody got to him .
come on , wait .
why would shooter care if tom greenleaf knows he' s here ?
well , it depends .
on what ?
on what he plans to do to you .
i' m revising my opinion , mort .
i don' t think shooter' s just some nut .
we need to consider the possibility that he was hired to do this .
somebody with a grudge against you hires a tough guy to rattle you ... ... scare you to death .
but he hires the wrong guy .
things get out of control .
they go further than they' re supposed to .
dead dogs ... ... burnt down houses .
now he can' t call him off .
ted .
who ?
ted .
amy' s ted .
the ted that amy left me for .
that' s why he calls himself shooter .
ted wants me to know it' s him .
he' s trying to intimidate me , trying to send me a message .
why ?
what does he want ?
i don' t know .
did you piss him off ?
i might have .
okay , here' s what we do .
what proof do you have that shooter was there ?
other than the manuscript .
physical evidence , i' m talking about .
bruises .
i got bruises on my arms from where he grabbed me .
all right .
you and me are going to go see greenleaf together .
all right .
bring the manuscript .
bring your bruises .
i' m gonna push the guy hard , make it impossible for him to lie .
if he' il tell the police he was threatened too , we' ve got something .
bowie' s store , breakfast ?
9 a . m .
sharp .
i' il see you there .
and bring your six gun , pilgrim .
it is a good ending .
oh , shit .
shit .
pall mall .
cracker bastard .
sorry .
ken ?
tom ?
would you like a pack ?
i don' t smoke .
did a guy come in here looking for me around 9 : 00 ?
no .
big guy , kind of a new york cop type .
no .
no , that doesn' t ring a bell .
i overslept .
well , maybe he did too , because he wasn' t here .
yeah .
what are you doing here ?
matter of fact , i was just on my way over to your place .
where' s your buddy ?
came alone .
sure you did .
i know what you' re up to .
look , mort ...
a lot of what' s going on right now is my fault .
most of it , in fact .
what do you want ?
i want you out of our life .
gotta sign your papers , mort .
my divorce papers ?
tell her to send them to my lawyer .
she did .
he said that you won' t return his calls for weeks .
this is about the settlement ?
just calm down .
money ?
it' s not about money .
this is about getting this thing done .
because i' m afraid if we don' t , who knows where it might go .
i think you know what i mean .
i don' t respond well to intimidation .
makes me feel icky .
you know ?
you know , i' m attempting to have a normal conversation here .
i buried my dog , mister .
this whole thing is out of your control now .
you know it , i know it .
you started this shit , i' m gonna finish it .
now , do me a favor , go back and tell that to your filthy little friend .
god !
bummer , ted .
yeah ?
go to where we met the other day .
walk down the path a little way .
why ?
i' il catch up with you this afternoon .
anybody you call between now and then is your responsibility .
tom ?
greenleaf ?
quarter past 2 .
you been out about three hours .
your leg' s sleeping .
you laid on the damn thing .
now , i would have moved you , but i didn' t want to wake you .
got tired of waiting .
almost pinned a note on you .
decided not to .
you scare too easy .
i wouldn' t go too far if i were you .
i hooked you to those two men in more ways than you know .
you' re insane .
i' m going to the police .
whose screwdriver you think is in that fella' s head ?
if you leave them here and i disappear ... ... you' il find yourself standing with your head in the noose ... ... and your feet in crisco .
what do you want from me ?
why , i told you that already , mr. rainey .
i want you to fix my story .
the one you stole .
or ain' t you ready to admit it yet ?
i did not steal your story .
i expect you' il let yourself go to greenhaven for murder ... ... before you' il admit it .
i have the magazine , you lunatic !
i have the magazine !
i have the goddamn magazine !
you have this so called magazine right now ?
on me , no .
i was gonna go pick it up at 3 : 00 .
there can' t be any magazine .
not with that story in it .
that story is mine .
what do you want ?
to kill me ?
why don' t you just do it ?
just kill me .
no , sir .
these others here were gonna get in the way of our business .
i couldn' t have that .
you bring me that story ... ... if it exists .
your house in two hours .
you got some heavy lifting here first .
i' d get to it if i were you .
by the way ... ... if you talk to that sheriff of yours again ... ... or if you don' t show up at 4 : 00 ... ... i will burn your life and every person in it ... ... like a cane field in a high wind .
when i show you the magazine that has my name on the contents page ... ... with my story inside ... ... then what ?
then i turn myself in .
but i' d take care of myself before a trial , mr. rainey .
because if things turn out that way ... ... then i suppose i am crazy .
and that kind of crazy man ... ... has no reason or excuse to live .
listen , you got my hat .
i want it , one way or the other .
hello ?
mort ?
yeah , hi .
i' ve been so worried about you .
are you okay ?
i' m okay .
i' m okay , amy .
are you sure ?
when i saw you yesterday , you seemed so strained .
i mean ...
what ?
do you ... ?
do you think things would' ve been different if we hadn' t lost the baby ?
jesus christ , i don' t ...
amy , i don' t know .
let me call you later .
i gotta go .
i gotta be somewhere .
what ?
what is it , amy ?

breathe .
take a breath .
where are you ?
you at ted' s ?
yeah .
how we feeling about old ted these days ?
i don' t know .
i love him , i guess .
that' s good .
i didn' t go with other men , you know .
i always wanted to tell you that i didn' t go with other men .
only ted , and only the last few months after you and me were already over .
if we were over while we were still together , you might' ve mentioned it ... ... because it was news to me .
that' s because you weren' t there anymore .
you were gone all the time .
i worked at home , amy !
that' s not what i mean .
even when you were with me , you were gone , up in your head .
i don' t think that i looked in your eyes and saw you looking back at me ... ... i mean , really with me , for the last two years .
you know what , you' re right .
you' re absolutely right .
it' s all my fault .
no .
i was a chickenshit .
ted wanted us to tell you together .
he kept asking , i kept putting it off .
i' il never forget that look on your face .
get out !
get out !
i gotta go .
mort , wait .
can' t we just ... ?
no !
i' ve gotta go .
will you call me if you need me ?
i doubt it .
can i come up there ?
why on earth would you do that ?
you still haven' t signed the papers yet , mort .
i know you don' t want to deal with it .
me neither .
but everything' s been negotiated .
we don' t disagree on a thing .
i don' t understand why you won' t sign .
don' t you want to get it over with ?
unbelievable .
you were worried about me , and i believed you .
what an idiot .
i am worried .
you sound like you did six months ago , and i think it' s my fault .
it' s my fault , and i wish i could take it back , but i can' t .
i guess you shouldn' t have fucked him , then !
you' re not going up there ?
i am not going to dance around this anymore .
once he signs , it' il be over .
we won' t have these horrible conversations .
all right , well , i' m going with you .
i just ...
i really think i should go alone , ted .
well , that makes no sense .
just the sight of you is gonna send him .
i was married to the guy for 10 years , i know how to talk to him .
all i want is for this to be over .
excuse me .
i' il be back around 7 .
hey , mr. rainey !
i' d like to ...
yeah , yeah , yeah .
hey .
mr. rainey .
mr. rainey , are you all right ?
i' m sorry , my throat just double clutched on me for a second .
you' re very pale .
yeah , thank you .

just the one thing .
pardon me ?
just the one thing , i said .
oh .
yeah .
thank you .

post office would have a cow if they knew we handled the ups guy' s stuff .
i know that , and i certainly appreciate it .
you won' t tell them , will you ?
no way .

because i saw what you did .
i' m sorry ?
i said , they' d shoot me if you did .
you ought to go home and lie down , mr. rainey .
you don' t look well at all .

we' il tie you to them ... ... and you' re going away .
in the meantime , i' d appreciate it if you didn' t come into town anymore .
makes people uncomfortable .
you can do your shopping in new london .

no problem .
you know ... ... the only thing that matters is the ending .
it' s the most important part of the story , the ending .
and this one ... ... is very good .
this one' s perfect .
i know i can do it , todd downey said ... ... helping himself to another ear of corn from the steaming bowl .
