they' re trying to be us .
no , they used to be us .
learning how to be us again .
no way .
some germ or some devil got those things up and walking ... but there' s a big difference between us and them .
they' re dead .
it' s like they' re pretending to be alive .

he knows we' re here .

<i> life goes on</ i> <i>at fiddler' s green ... </ i> <i>in the heart of one of america' s</ i> <i>oldest and greatest cities . </ i>
<i>bordered on three sides</ i> <i>by mighty rivers ... </ i>
<i>fiddler' s green offers luxury living</ i> <i>in the grand old style . </ i>
<i>dine at one of</ i> <i>six fine restaurants . </ i>
<i>look for that perfect gift in our fully stocked</ i> <i>shopping mall . </ i>
man , they sure did used to make it sound nice .
still sounds nice to me .
<i> there is a difference between</ i> <i>our place and other places . </ i>
<i>if you can appreciate</ i> <i>that difference ... </ i>
you' re not going to be around no more ?
you little bitch , you can come up and party with me any time you want .
i hate going under the river .
cholo .
shit .
let' s get out of here , foxy .
yeah , man .
back off , riley .
just back the fuck off ' cause i am not in the mood .
you think that kid was in the mood ?
look , he knew the risk , man .
he took the job like we all took the job knowing the risk .
exactly , the job .
you know what the job is , cholo ?
it' s to bring things in that people need .
not to make a few extra bucks selling liquor on the street .
what , you' re talking about this ?
this is for me and my new friends , to celebrate .
that' s what that' s for .
a kid died out there on the street tonight ... so that you can fucking celebrate .
riley , you know what you remind me of ?
you remind me of my old man .
a nice guy .
i loved him and all that but he was a dumbass .
never went for anything , so he never had anything .
what do you got , riley ?
nothing .
i' m going to have my own place , man .
my own goddamn place .
you' re dreaming , cholo .
they won' t let you in there .
they wouldn' t let me in there .
we' re the wrong kind .
yeah , well , we' il see .
<i>isn' t it time ? </ i>
<i>isn' t it your time ? </ i>
<i>for fiddler' s green ? </ i>
demora , supplies unit .
what' s in them boxes ?
essential supplies .
for kaufman .
<i>mark your calendars . </ i>
<i>mr .
kaufman</ i> <i>cordially invites ... </ i> <i>residents of the green</ i> <i>to a masked ball ... </ i> <i>on the eve of allhallows . </ i>
<i>it is strictly forbidden</ i> <i>to come as you are . </ i>
it' s expensive .
look at that .
you like it ?
i could tell .
can i ask you to stop , sir ?
quitting time , deke .
you' re going to need this to get back in .
when i said quitting time , i meant quitting time .
hey , baby .
the only way to the father , is through me , " sayeth the lord .
so , riley , you want to go get a drink ?
just look at me .
you can tell i could use a drink .
you know , charlie , why don' t you go ahead ?
i' il catch up .
where are you going ?
i got to see a man about a car .
a car ?
all right .
here' s the deal .
rivers protect us on two sides .
bridges are all blocked up .
the only overland access is here , called the " throat .
and these fences go all the way across ?
half a mile , both ways .
stench .
high noon .
shit .
they don' t come around here much anymore .
it' s like they' ve learned they can' t get in .
take his fucking face off .
how long are you going to let kaufman push you around ?
you like shining his shoes , pressing his pants ?
he didn' t build that place .
he just took it over .
kept the best for himself , and left us with a slum to live in .
but if there' s enough of us , if all of you would join up ... we could make this a fit place to live in .
dad , look who' s here .
riley denbo !
i used to work with him .
bringing in toothpicks for the bastards to pick at their gums .
and food and other stuff , for all of us .
come in with us , riley .
both of you .
together we' d be unstoppable .
no one' s unstoppable , mulligan .
you' re worried about being locked out .
now , you see that ?
i can' t help but think we' re all locked in .
i' m looking for a world where there' s no fences .
here .
antibiotics for your boy .
thanks .

i' m fine , dad .
hey , easy , easy , knipp !

lady , you know what i have to do .
i' m sorry .
dad !

shut up .
hey , kid .
what the hell' s going on here ?
it' s your problem .
clean it up .
hey , lady , it' s okay .
what did you do to my car ?
what car ?
the last car i drove out of this town was three years ago .
no , i bought a car .
it was right there yesterday .
there were two guys working on it .
there was nobody here this morning .
son of a bitch .

did you get fucked ?
come with me .
you got fucked .
roach .
hey , how' s it going ?
i' ve been better .
where' s chihuahua ?
around the back .
come on !
lot of action in here today .
we' ve got a new kind of game .
what are they betting on ?
black and red .
who wins the fight .
stenches don' t fight .
they do when there' s food .
what' s on the menu , cat or dog ?
i told you , today it' s something new .
who do you want , black or red ? $60 on black .
what the fuck happened to my car ?
they' re fixing it up .
no , i went to the garage .
there' s nothing there .
your guys aren' t there , and my car is not there .
this is not me .
i do not do this to you .
i' m your friend .
well , be my friend and get my fucking car back ... or i' il have to carry you out of here inside that fucking hat .
this guy could be trouble .
keep him busy .
give a drink .
let me have my gun .
supply run last night , huh ?
i heard you got some money .
not interested .
i' il show you how to turn that money into more ...
i said i' m not interested .
jesus !
fuck !
my suit .
he ruined my fucking suit !
shit .
i' m all right .
thank you .
thank you .
i' ve seen you around .
i' ve seen you around , too , working the streets .
you were checking me out ?
what the hell happened here ?
someone shot the little fat man .
i see that .
you' re under arrest .
hey .
what ?
why you ?
why' d the little fat man throw you in there with them things ?
wasn' t the little man .
it was the big man .
mr. k.
he' s got his fingers in everything here .
if you can drink it , shoot it up ... fuck it , gamble on it , it belongs to him .
didn' t answer the question .
he asked you why .
i know what he asked me .
they found out i was helping out mulligan and his people ... tired of eating bones while he' s having a steak .
me , too , but every place is the same .
places with people .
i' m going to find a place where there' s no people .
north .
canada .
if you get a way out ...
i' m coming with you .
no , riley likes to be alone .
he might take me , ' cause he says ... having me around is pretty much the same as being alone .
and ' cause i can make myself useful , and i can shoot .
i can shoot .
i can be pretty fucking useful .
i had training .
i was going to join the army , help the green ... till somebody figured i' d be a better hooker than a soldier .
you know , i don' t want to hear your fucking story .
everyone' s got a story , and i am sick of hearing them .
what' s your story , riley ?
i don' t have one .
nothing bad ever happened to me till everything changed .
everything changed for all of us .
hey , mulligan .
what they going to do ?
kill him ?
not right away .
first they' il try to get him to talk .
about people like me .
mr. demora .
boss .
how was uniontown ?
dead .
death intrudes on us even here in the city , i' m afraid .
i heard abut what happened with my neighbors .
and i' m grateful for your help .
that' s what i' m here for , boss ... to take care of any problems you got .
look , i got you a little present , a little souvenir from town .
i know you' re used to better vintage than this ... but it' s the best we got .
little champers to take the edge off things .
there we go .
this is very extravagant .
yeah , well , i can afford it .
with the $20, 000 you owe me from last night ... and the money from all the other nights together ...
i got enough for my own place .
you mean here in the green ?
sure , why not ?
i' m sorry , mr. demora ... but there' s a very long waiting list .
how long ?
well ... this is an extremely desirable location .
space is very limited .
you mean restricted , don' t you ?
i do have a board of directors ... and i have a membership committee .
they have to approve .
don' t do this to me .
don' t .
how long have i been working for you ?
three years ?
taking out your garbage , cleaning up after you ... and then you' re going to say i' m not good enough ?
let me tell you something , you' re going to let me in ... because i know what goes on around here .
do your committee members know ... what the fuck is going out with the garbage ?
so , you' re gonna let me in , you hear me ?
maybe we could talk about this when you' re a little less excited .
i won' t be needing this man anymore .
take that , you scary zombie .
... come back to god .
give up your lives of sin .
praise the lord !
father is the only way .
come back to jesus .
fox , get the guys .
we' re going out .
want me to call riley ?
forget riley .
just us .
come on .
thanks .
shit , man .
you win .
you got him right in the brain .
that' s right .
double or nothing .
brubaker , who' d you blow to get this cushy job ?
cholo , you bum , how' s it going ?
where' s riley ?
he' s retired .
we' re taking the truck out .
that' s from yesterday .
what ?
you' re shitting me .
i' m gonna quit drinking , man .
what the hell is that ?
relax .
it' s just target practice .
barrett , stop scratching around back there .
you' re going to fuck up my shot .
i' m not doing nothing , man , i' m just standing here .
there' s nothing there , man .
so , what the hell is that , screaming practice ?
<i> stenches ! </ i>
<i>they' re all over the place . </ i>
let' s make our move .
come on .
all right , go .
their eyes .
mouse , take that .
cholo , should we send up some sky flowers ?
it ain' t our fight , fox .
the stenches want to get in , let them in .
come on .
everybody , get busy .
that' s our way out .
should we do something about this ?
that' s our way out , get us there .
no .
get out of here !
no !
<i>kaufman . </ i>
the one that got away .
<i>that' s right . </ i>
<i>remember you said we should talk</ i> <i>when i was less excited ? </ i>
<i>i' m a lot less excited</ i> <i>right now . </ i>
what do you want , mr. demora ?
you might have noticed that i had to leave in a hurry ... so i didn' t get a chance to take my money out of your bank .
i' d like you to handle that withdrawal for me .
with interest : $5 million .
or i' m gonna blow you out of your fucking castle .
because i got dead reckoning .
that' s unfortunate .
<i>well , unfortunate for you, </ i> <i>perhaps . </ i>
<i>i want you to put that money</ i> <i>on a boat ... </ i> <i>and send it across the river to the south side, </ i> <i>10th street pier . </ i>
<i>one man to drive the boat, </ i> <i>no more . </ i>
you have till midnight , that' s two and a half hours .
i won' t be there , and dead reckoning won' t be there .
but i' il know if it happens , and i' il know if it doesn' t happen .
copy ?
trouble ?
in a world where the dead are returning to life ... the world " trouble " loses much of its meaning .
he wants money .
pay him .
we don' t negotiate with terrorists .
we have other options .
denbo .
give me denbo .
get up .
you' re coming with me .
where you taking him ?
don' t worry .
where are you taking him ?
you take care of him ?
hell , yeah .
he pulled me out of the fire .
it was bad .
just look at me , you can tell it was bad .
mr. denbo , can i offer you a drink ?
i don' t drink .
why am i here ?
we want you to repossess a vehicle that belongs to us ... a vehicle that you designed , mr. denbo .
dead reckoning has been stolen by your second in command ... who i want captured or killed ... and i want my $2 million piece of equipment returned .
my truck .
my truck , which has guns .
powerful guns .
it' il do a great deal of damage ... if they' re aimed at this city .
why don' t you just send out your troops ?
i can send 50 men against that thing ... and they' d come back in body bags .
now , cholo was your man .
maybe you can get close enough to do what has to be done .
it' s a good thing i' m still in town .
see , i bought a car .
i was going to drive out of here , but it disappeared .
i guess someone didn' t want me to leave .
you' re a very popular man .
how much are your services going to cost me ?
a vehicle , enough weapons and ammunition to go north .
but there' s nothing up north .
that' s the idea .
my friends , they go with me .
take them .
can you find dead reckoning , quickly ?
how quickly ?
midnight .
i have a way .
be born , die , and we all know the other one , don' t we ?
yeah , okay , cholo .
just don' t leave me here alone too long ...
two hours max .
give me a call .
let me know if we' re rich or not .
all right , two hours .
give him something for the nerves .
something for the nerves .
stay real .
okay .
can' t believe you guys are turning me into a fucking boy scout .
not a boy .
you don' t have to come out if you don' t want to .
i didn' t say that .
some shit , though , going out to save kaufman' s ass .
i' m not doing this for kaufman .
this is for the people in the city .
what do you think' s going to happen to them if cholo shells the green ?
okay .
i' m with you .
no , i like the ones i already got .
this piece fires 14 rounds a second .
i don' t normally need that many .
i don' t normally talk to retards .
pretty easy to make fun of some people , huh ?
i could make a whole lot of fun out of you .
i' il take this one .
he thinks he' s taking care of you .
he does .
without his guns , i' d be dead by now .
without you , he' d be dead by now .
fair trade .
riley , these guys are coming .
gentlemen and lady .
mr. kaufman thought you could use some support .
don' t need any .
nevertheless .
manolete .
manolete , named after the bullfighter .
monica .
you can call me motown .
pillsbury .
i' m here to do something .
why are we standing around ?
let' s do something .
we taking the jeep ?
the woody .
it' s bigger , has guns .
jeez .
cholo made a mess .
no .
cholo didn' t do all this .
this is stenches .
a lot of them .
maybe still here .
that' s where they came in .
look .
that' s where they went out .
trying to get to the city .
i' m going to go get the ammo .
crank up the woody , charlie .
make sure she doesn' t hurt herself .
i can take care of myself , okay ?
fine .
charlie , make sure she doesn' t hurt anyone else .
you , come with me .
<i>walkers , mr. denbo ? </ i>
and moving toward the city .
<i>they' il never get across the river . </ i>
i wouldn' t be so sure .
<i> they learned</ i> <i>how to work together . </ i>
they' re mindless walking corpses ... and many of us will be , too ... if you don' t stay focused on the task at hand .
zombies , man .
they creep me out .
do you really think they can get across the water ?
if you asked me that a week ago , i would have said no .
but now ...
one way or the other , we got to get our hands on dead reckoning .
there' s more of them out there .
i can hear them .
they' re always out there .
you' re all right ?
yeah , no problem .
woody' s in there .
who' s got the keys , guys ?
no keys to get .
melted .
screw the keys .
let' s just hot wire the fucking thing .
yellow to red .
what the fuck does a samoan know about hot wiring a fucking car ?
fifty thousand cars stolen in samoa every year .
yeah ?
well , a million in detroit .
detroit' s got 50 million cars .
50, 000 .
every one stolen .
charlie .
why do you lick your rifle ?
it catches the light .
what light ?
how can you see anything ?
good eye .
hey .
charlie ?
shit !
off center , but i got him .
awesome , man .
got a flashlight ?
yeah .
brubaker ?
hey , brubaker ?
brubaker , you there ?
hear that ?
yeah .
all right , keep that thing shining .
let' s get ammo .
there' s .
50 caliber around here somewhere .
great .
here' s the .
50 .
jesus christ .
no , not in here .
think about where we are .
take a breath .
choose your shots .
we' re even .
not .
that hurt .
i didn' t hurt you .
i got it .
oh , god .
is he bit ?
yeah .
go !
how long does he have ?
had a little brother bit .
he took less than an hour before he turned .
and then what happened ?
i shot him .
you said nothing bad ever happened to you .
that happened to my brother .
yeah .
dead is dead .
and that ain' t you or me .
i' m sorry .
no !
no !
i recognize that some of you are concerned ... and i wanna assure you ... that if anything goes wrong , measures have been taken .
i' ve established outposts with food and supplies ... that will support us on our way .
on our way to where ?
anywhere that we want to go .
alternative sites have been chosen for us and our families ... as well as necessary support personnel .
what about all the others ?
all the others can be replaced by others .
boss .
you' re interrupting me , bill .
it' s bad timing .
just when i was talking about how people can be replaced .
a day may come when you earn yourself some responsibilities .
but right now the responsibilities are mine .
they' re all mine .
it was my ingenuity that took an old world ... and made it into something new .
i put up the fences to make it safe .
i hired the soldiers and paid for their training .
i kept the people off the streets by giving them games and vices ... which cost me money .
but i spend it because the responsibility is mine .
now , do you understand the meaning of the word responsibility ?
we have to do what we have to do .
foxy , i know i' m never gonna be great .
i' m never gonna be on the list of names of people ... who done great things because i don' t do anything .
not one thing .
if it wasn' t for this truck , i wouldn' t be any different ... than that poor mexican bastard out there .
cholo , look , kaufman might not pay .
kaufman' s gonna pay , man .
but if he doesn' t , he knows i' m gonna do a jihad on his ass .
when you hit route 6 , take a right .
how do you know which way to go ?
homing device .
cool .
how long since you been out here ?
i' ve never been out .
i' ve lived in the city since it was a real city .
pull over .
cover them , charlie .
all right , you' re working for kaufman , i' m working for kaufman .
my job is to stop cholo .
your job is to bring the truck back , with or without me , right ?
not without you , no .
well , that means yes .
here' s what' s going to happen .
i' m going to do my job .
you' re not going to get to do yours .
kaufman is never going to see dead reckoning again .
and when i get it , i' m gonna do what i want with it .
anyone has any problems with that , you can get out right here .
some choice .
no choice .
close door .
keep them covered , charlie .
wait .
you made us come all the way out here ... just to steal a fucking truck ?
you made a deal , riley .
you' re going back on a deal .
you never done that before .
if cholo shells the green , all deals are off .
if something worse happens , i don' t know about you ... but i don' t want to be out here in a car without a roof .
mouse , you got anything ?
no boat , no money , no nothing .
load the six packs .
six pack loaded .
all right , load the other six .
we' re not gonna show them any goddamn mercy .
i know where cholo' s going .
where ?
mount washington , overlooks the city .
we can beat him there .
in that truck , he' s gotta take the main roads .
we can take the back streets .
right .
make a right on ivy , then take a left on westminster .
you wanna go up the hill ?
yes , i' m wanna go up the hill .
let' s go up the hill .
almost midnight , sir .
pack us up .
we might be leaving .
in the boat ?
i' d rather be taking dead reckoning ... but not available .
from this hillside , they can shell the green .
they' re gonna be coming up this road .
pull in around the corner .
all right , they' re coming .
you guys stay here and keep real quiet .
i' m going to try and talk my way inside .
he' s going to steal that truck and leave us here .
riley would never do that .
just look at him , you can tell he' d never do that .
i like that man .
you , go help him .
go .
everything' s okay back there .
it' s too late to send me back .
now , put that thing away .
put on your best sunday smile , and just try to look friendly .
i am friendly .
hey , cholo .
take a look at this .
it' s denbo and his idiot .
all right .
stop the truck .
come on , here .
so , how did you get up here ?
in the woody .
i tracked you with this .
forgot to tell you ... the truck' s got a little transmitter in her belly .
you were always a smart guy .
<i>always a lot smarter</ i> <i>than me , man . </ i>
that' s not saying much .
open up .
what , are you fucking nuts ?
open up .
hey , charlie .
so , who' s the smart one now ?
thought you would have quit ... but here you are still working for the man , aren' t you , riley ?
what ?
kaufman sent you up to take care of me ?
yeah .
takes a true friend to stab you right in the front , doesn' t it ?
that man pulls the trigger , he' s dead .
who else is out there ?
kaufman sent some guys with us .
we took care of them .
cover him .
pretty boy , lock in the target .
we' re running out of time .
i got you now .
you hit that tower square on ... you' re gonna kill a lot of innocent people .
you miss , you hit the city , you' re gonna kill a lot of our friends .
want to know who killed our friends ?
kaufman is the one that' s killed our friends .
every time i took out his garbage , i took out one of our friends ... people he wanted off the streets .
he turned me into a goon , then he' s gonna piss all over me ?
i don' t think so .
what are you gonna get out of this , cholo ?
hopefully my money .
money burns .
yeah , not if it' s in a vault .
all right , mr. k. , won' t be needing you anymore .
you set this right ?
yes .
riley , you did something to it with your fucking little toy .
this ?
what the fuck did you do ?
fix it .
fix it .
not a fucking chance .
cholo , look out .
fuck .
you know , riley ... there' s something about you that i' ve always really hated .
you' re still here , aren' t you ?
what do you care ?
you got what you wanted .
you' re hit .
how you doing in there , charlie ?
i' m being friendly .
what' s in the bags ?

i might not have done otherwise .
you lied to me , denbo .
you didn' t get demora .
he' s shooting at us .
<i>that' s not cholo , mr. kaufman . </ i>
holy shit .
they got across the river .
look at that .
i didn' t even have to blow the place up .
the fucking stenches did it for me .
we' re going back to the city to see if we can help .
pick him up .
where we going , man ?
what are we doing ?
easy , gargantua , come on .
get him inside .
quick .
not this horse .
not this horse .

thanks .
anyone else ?
where you gonna go , cholo ?
there' s always that outpost in cleveland .
haven' t heard from them in a while .
take my chances .
you have no right .
no right .
woody' s around the corner .
guns and ammo inside .
thanks .
get us back on the main road .
you have blood , here .
we almost lost you there .
you all right ?
yeah .
you want to be really helpful , roll me one .
yeah , all right .
what was built to keep people safe is gonna trap them inside .
<i> this is denbo</ i> <i>in the reckoning . </ i>
<i>open up those fences</ i> <i>and let the people out . </ i>
the fences are still hot .
we can' t cut the juice from here .
we' ve been trying to call the power station .
there' s no one left over there .
we got to get the fuck out of here .
there' s no one left here , either .
move it .
we can rocket those fences .
got to get across river .
the bridges into the city , they' re all bricked up .
let' s just fucking blast our way through .
no , we can' t do that .
there' s a war going on over there .
we cross any of these bridges ... we' re gonna end up right in the middle of it .
we have to come in outside of the throat .
somehow , fox , i thought we' d be traveling ... in a lot better style than this , baby .
at least we' re still fucking traveling , brother .
what ?
come on , fox , let' s get the hell out of here .
what ?
can you fucking believe it ?
nothing works out the way you want it to .
there' s something always comes around the corner and just gets you .
it' s your choice , bro .
i always wanted to see how the other half lives .
the old j& l can take us over .
it' s a drawbridge .
they leave it up .
that means it' s not guarded .
can you get us there ?
yeah .
let' s go .
i can stay with you , if you want .
no .
no .
this is between me and the man .
fox , she' s all yours .
hope you do better than you did with me , man .
yeah .
holy shit !
<i> a disturbance</ i> <i>has been reported ... </ i> <i>on the outskirts of the city . </ i>
<i>there' s no reason</ i> <i>to believe ... </ i> <i>that fiddler' s green</ i> <i>could ever be compromised . </ i>
<i>but we suggest that residents report any sightings</ i> <i>of unusual behavior . </ i>
there it is .
let' s hope it' s still wired into the grid .
shut the hatch , just in case .
when i get the bridge down , you come pick me up .

it' s just like a video game .
what the fuck are you doing ?
