i started every interview
i' ve ever given the same way for over 10 years .
so , when did you fall in love with hip hop ?
i basically fell in love with hip hop , you know what i' m saying , when cats first started going out to the parks , you know , with the 2 turntables , the mic .
i think it was 1977 .
people are rocking in the parks .
i can remember back in the bronx , 1979 .
set up some turntables in front of the building .
and we was getting the power from the street lamps outside .
plug it up into the street pole .
mc ing , djj ing , b boying , break dancing .
break dancing or popping , beats or rhymes , you know .
i was in love with it .
probably about 12 years old , man .
and i was watching wild style .
it was creative , it was new , it was fresh .
breakin ' , rappin ' , battlin ' .
it was the whole culture , period .
the bambaataa show , the afrika islam show .
it was just like our way of expression .
hip hop spoke directly to me because , you know , it was speaking from the language that the people i was dealing with was speaking , and i loved it as soon as i ...
as soon as i got introduced to it .
i was gonna be dealing with hip hop whether i wanted to or not .
like a forced marriage , it was predetermined .
and i heard eric b is president , and then that kind of changed my life .
i heard the message , melle mel .
there was a rapper named eddie cheeba who was one of the pioneers .
when i first heard sugarhill gang .
rapper' s delight .
rapper' s delight .
that set it off for rap music .
funky four plus one more .
plus one more , you know what i' m saying ?
furious five , freedom .
run and them and whoudini freestyling .
sucka mc' s by run dmc .
sucka mc' s live .
grandmaster flash on the wheels of steel .
grandmaster caz from the cold crush brothers .
cold crush .
cold crush .
cold crush .
grandmaster flash .
treacherous three , body rock .
spoonie gee , love rap .
the first time i heard rebel without a pause .
eric b and rakim .
epmd and them .
i gotta say public enemy as a group ... you know .
classics , bangers .
i mean , to this day they' re bangers .
i just love what it sounded like , and i loved what he was saying .
you know , the whole slick tongue thing .
i felt like these dudes hit the truth .
forget everything else you heard on the radio and all that .
this is it .
this is what i want to do .
i was in .
it was freedom .
i remember the exact day
i fell in love with hip hop .
it was ...
bye !

the day i saw slick rick , who went by ricky d back then ,
dana dane , and doug e. fresh battle in the bronx was the day i truly met hip hop .

ricky d would would join the get fresh crew and record the hip hop classic the show , and of course the b side la di da di .
dana dane would drop a couple years later with his classic cinderfella .
but little did i know how much hip hop would be a part of my life .
hip hop was as young , naive , confused , sometimes innocent , and sometimes as mischievous as i was .
and as i grew up ...

sid , i could ...
i could feel that look of yours from 3, 000 miles away .
and i was ready , too .

not even a little bite sized ,
melt in your mouth , not in your hand " punk out ?

the union of hip hop to the mainstream was a hard thing to imagine .
hip hop was always this personal , regional thing that belonged to just me .
starting with fab 5 freddie and yo . !
mtvraps . !
anyone with a television set and cable box could get a piece of hip hop .
i knew i was gonna have to share , and that was hard to get used to .
# one shot to your heart without breaking your skin #
# no one has the power #
# to hurt you like your kin #
# kept it inside , didn' t tell no one else #
# didn' t even wanna admit it to yourself #
# and now it just burns and your back aches #
# from 15 years of holding the pain #
# and now you only have yourself to blame #
# if you continue to live this way #

no , not at millenium .
i wasn' t .
i mean , you know how much i love music , how much i love hip hop ,
how it makes me feel , dre ...
and i lost that love at millenium .
how could you make a change like this without consulting me ?
' cause this is something i had to do for me .
plus , i know you would' ve just tried to talk me out of it , and ...
it' s not fair for you to assume that .
you don' t know that .
reese , you mean to tell me , had i told you , you wouldn' t have tried to talk me out of it ?
yes , i would have tried to talk you out of it , but i' m supposed to do that .
you get so excited , and you don' t think straight , and then you do something like this .
you can' t make a major life decision just because you feel like it ...
i don' t need you to be my lawyer !
reesey , i need you to be my wife .
and a husband is supposed to consult his wife when he changes the plan .
and a wife supports her husband !
baby , i need your support !
ok , fine .
i support you .
i' il call some money people .
we' il get this squared away .
that' s all taken care of .
uh ...
sid said she' d help out with some of the investing , and ...

commandeering the kitchen , serving you like a queen .

you ballplayers .
all right .
i didn' t think so .
you think you' re gonna get some booty , don' t you ?
well , yeah .
yeah ?
that' s the plan .
one of these days .
come on , that' s what this is all about .
you know , the dating , the awkward walks home .
that' s what men and women do .
you got it all figured out , don' t you ?
i' m just tryin ' to be straight up .
you put a man and a woman together long enough , and ... something' s gonna go down .
well , what makes you think you gonna be around long enough for something to go down ?
well , i think i got a pretty good shot .
it' s not that good .
especially outside 20 feet .
and you could work on that d a little , too .

hey , reese .
sidney , hi !
hey , how you doing ?
i never see you in here .
well ...
i usually don' t have the time , but ... ever since dre started this record label project ,
i' ve had a lot more free time .
so i guess i actually have you to thank for bringing me back to class .
me ?
yeah .
you know ?
for all of your support of dre and his project .
all right , everybody , listen up .
we' re just about ready to go .
i want you to find a partner , grab a pair of focus mitts .
we' re gonna do some punch combos .
alternate on my whistle .
oh , thanks .
i' m already working with my man right here .
just you and me .
whoa .
ohh !
you ok , reese ?
oh , yeah , i' m fine .
i' m just ...
fine .
i' m ...
i' m just ... thankin ' you .
ok , reese .
we' re both big girls .
let' s let it out .
you have a problem with me and my friendship with dre ?
no , i don' t have a problem with your friendship with dre .
i have a problem ... that you' re in love with dre .
what ?
it' s understandable .
dre' s an incredible man .
listen , me and dre have been through a lot together .
so , yes , i love him as a friend ,
like a brother , but that' s it !
friend , brother , whatever .
he ...
he lets you in ... in a way that he hasn' t let me in yet .
and all the secrets ...
i have to ... beg for ... you already know !
so just maybe the fact that ... you' re that close ... bothers me !
i realize my friendship with dre may make things awkward ... but i am not gonna apologize for it !
i don' t want you to apologize for it !
that' s not what i' m saying .
i knew you were friends with dre when we got married , but this is not what i expected .
this was not part of our plan .
i never see him any ... more ... because of this ... record label thing !
you just said " record label thing ,
like it' s a hobby or a distraction .
this label is more than just a thing to him !
well , you know , like i said , i guess ... you know him better than i do .

anyway , this has been a hell of a year , as all of y' all know , full of ups and downs .
um ... for one , i married this beautiful young woman beside me ... mmm ...
which is cool .
but i also lost my job at millenium .
no , no , bruh , the job lost you .
that' s right !
yeah , ok , i like that .
i like that .
but because of it ,
i , um ...
i was able to start my own label .
all right !
whoo !
that took a lot of courage .
thank you .
i would like to thank all of y' all for all of y' all' s support during this , uh ... this time .
i would especially ... [ sighs ]
like to thank my best friend , who , uh , left that 75 degree weather to come back home .
you are the perfect verse over a tight beat .
ooh !
word up !
to hip hop .
and to the new year !
yeah !

hippy hip hip !
yeah !
yeah , yeah !
ok .
let' s get to the food !

excuse me .
uh , since ... uh , since we' re all celebrating ,
i' d like to ... excuse me .
i' m sorry .
i' d like to take this to another level .

i don' t ...
i don' t know what to say .
say yes .
yes .
all right !
aah !
yeah !
yes .
so , what is the difference between rap and hip hop ?
it' s simple .
it' s like the difference between saying you love somebody and being in love with somebody .
rap is just a word .
um , what are you doin ' ?
gettin ' more to drink .
you know what i' m talkin ' about .
gettin ' into this whole ... marriage thing .
don' t you think this is just a little too fast ?
you' ve only known the cat for a couple months .
about as long as you knew reese before you got married .
that' s why you doing this ?
this whole competition thing ?
what , i marry reese and you marry sasquatch ?
oh , so now i' m doing this ' cause of you ?
you arrogant son of a bitch !
you really on your own sack right now .
so i guess since i can' t marry you , i' m marrying kelby .
no , no , no , no !
no , that' s not what i meant .
no .
hey ...
sid , that' s not what i meant .
sid , don' t ...
sid !

you need to talk to your friend .
what y' all goin ' through ?
you crazy .
ahh , here we go .
hey ...

yeah , that' s funny .
you ever wonder why they call them champagne flutes ?
no , i never really thought about it .
oh , shoot !
hey , don' t break the flute now .
if you find out , get back to me and let me know .
i will .
hey , that' s a nice outfit .
you look real ... real nice .
and the food was tight , too .
it was tasty and nutritious .
oh , shit .

it' s so hard to get respect as an mc when you' re a ballplayer .

but i was thinking , you could be my mentor .
right .
you know what i' m sayin ' ?
yeah .

you could work it out so my ... my ... my lyrics get tight .
tight .
tight lyrics .

you should hire a lawyer to negotiate your contract .

yeah , i mean , why pay an agent 4 % to negotiate numbers that are already set by a salary base cap ?
dre , don' t say anything .
quit while we still have a friendship .
hey , that' s what i' m tryin ' to do right now .
i' m trying to save our friendship .
i' m worried about you .
worried about me ?
yeah !
you need to stop worrying about me and worry about your own marriage .
so you' re ... excuse me .
so you' re the attorney
i' m supposed to hire , right ?
yeah !
very good !
my marriage ?
what you mean ?
what' s that supposed to mean ?
nothing .
nothing .
sidney .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
maybe this is not the best place ...
the best time to talk business , but i' m sure we' il have plenty of opportunity since our spouses are best friends .
best ...
best friends .
they' re so close .
yeah , well , how ... how do you feel with them being so close ?
well , let' s just say it' s very hard to get used to .
sidney , what did you mean ? !

hmm .
she' s a flirt .
all right ?
she flirts ...
she flirts a lot .
she' s always been a flirt .
and she' s flirted with me .
i' m cool with that .
she flirt .
ok .
that' s what i thought .
you' re probably right .
it' s when you talk like that , that' s what makes me think that you' re jealous .
what ? !
yes .
jealous !
no wonder you two are married .
you' re both crazy !
look here , contrary to what you and your wife may think ,
i don' t spend my nights thinkin ' about you , ok ? !
i got a man who' s fine , intelligent , successful , and gives it to me on a very , very regular basis , and the shit is the bomb !
so ?
i don' t care what ...
dre , i need you to be happy for me .
i need you to be there for me , just like you asked of me .

iook , hey , i' m sorry .
i didn' t ...
that' s cool .
that' s cool .
how could you know ?
she ain' t wearing the $15, 000 ring that i bought her ass .
i' m still paying it off , but you understand .
actually , i' m paying for it .
could you not put my business out on the street ?
will you be joining us for dinner ?
listen , my man ...
you know what ?
we were just about to leave .
i' m trying to order the most expensive bottle of champagne , ' cause we fixin ' to celebrate .
dre .
we gonna celebrate what ?
# my divorce # how about that ?
and some pork chops .
dre , come on .
' cause i' m kind of hungry .
all right ?
you' re making a scene .
good .
i want to make a scene .
you know what i' m sayin ' ?
bye bye , richard lawson .
this is so embarrassing .
i can' t believe you got me to do that .
hey , stop complaining .
you forget it was me who helped you
let all the air out of shawn' s tires when he asked angie to the homecoming dance instead of you .
key word : home ... coming .
high school .
we' re almost 30 years old , dre .
oh , time is a bitch .
i swear , i still feel like we' re just those 2 kids pop locking at the block parties .
you remember my first little beat machine ?
boy , you thought you were d nice .
the tr 808 .
bust this .
simplicity provides
a fine line between eloquence and plainness .
that' s a dope line .
and i know ll didn' t think he was that deep .
that was my first published article .
i can' t wait for your book to come out .
and when you left ,
i went out , got the l. a. times , every wednesday , for your column .
i' d go to the park and read it .
i don' t know , it just ... made me feel closer to you .
uh ... you want anything ?
coffee ?
vodka ?
uh , no .
i wanted them pork chops .
i told you we should have stayed for dinner .
how can you ... joke about this ?
' cause i would be flipping out .
ha ha !
sid , i do not know .
i guess i' il break down later .
you know what , though ?
i ...
i ...
i' m glad i know now .
i guess i always knew deep down inside that we weren' t meant to be together .
yeah ?
mm .
and when did you figure that out ?
the night before the wedding .
something happened between me leaving the house ... and , uh ... getting to the wedding .
but , you know , i shook it off ,
' cause , damn , i had a beautiful woman that loved me to death .
so , you know , i took all those feelings and ... locked them away ,
' cause not everybody can marry their one true love .
it was a pretty difficult situation .
do you , uh ... you know anybody like that ?
no , i don' t .
no ?
but ...
i do know somebody that was friends with this guy a long time , and ... she thought maybe it was more than just ... friends , but ... something happened to her , coincidentally , before your wedding .
oh , yeah ?
and ... she realized it was nothing more than just friends .
nothing ?
nothing .
just friends ?
just friends .
i can' t believe what just happened .
i know .
i don' t know what to say .
i mean , usually i' m like the energizer bunny .
you know .
i keep goin ' and goin ' ...
i was talking about us ... doing it .
this was bad .
we made a huge mistake .
honey , i said i was sorry .
i mean , next time i won' t be so caught off guard .
i' il use a little ginseng .
there isn' t gonna be a next time .
don' t you get it ?
this was bad .
real , real bad .
it couldn' t have been that bad .
dre , i' m not talking about that .
i' m getting married .
you' re still married .
and we ... we just got busy .
where are my shoes ?
they' re downstairs .
wait .
where you goin ' ?
this is your spot .
i need to get myself together .
i have to meet kelby after the game .
wait .
you' re not gonna tell him , are you ?
what are you gonna tell him ?
are you gonna tell him ?
i don' t know .
i ...
i ...
i ...
no , i' m not .
i' m not .
i' m ...
he doesn' t know what happened and i want to keep it that way .
well , you' re not gonna ... are you still gonna marry this cat after what we just had ?
dre ... what just happened was the most ... amazing ... most fulfilling ... most exhilarating ... 5 minutes i' ve ever had in my life .
7 .
10 minutes .
9 ?
ok .
8 .
whatever .
the point is , what do we do now ?
we can' t just go back to the way things were .
wait , wait .
what are you saying ?
i need space .
us staying so close , spending so much time together , just confuses things for me right now .
and besides , we wouldn' t even be here if it wasn' t for you catching reese .
why are you talking like that ?
why does it have to be all or nothing ?
because we both know it' s the right thing to do .
hey .
i know you' ve done this mad times .
i know you know what you' re doing .
but , you know , when you go in there , just , you know , be firm with them , you know what i' m sayin ' ?
yeah .
don' t punk out like you did with sidney .
just ... you stand your ground .
i never punk out with sidney .
you did .
all i did was respect her wishes .
sound like some punk logic right there .
how you figure ?
what about francine ?
you were feeling her , right ?
yeah .
you ain' t doin ' nothin ' about it .
i' m not ... the humphrey bogart in this .
i' m the peter lorre .
i' m the sidekick character .
you the humphrey bogart .
you had your opening .
you know what i' m saying ?
she wanted you to stop her from marrying the old dude , but you let it ride , you know ?
same thing bogey did , man .
you' re the same dude .
man , don' t be dissin ' humphrey bogart , man .
why not ?
' cause he' s humphrey bogart .
he' s the man .
yo , he was fightin ' a war .
that' s what they did back then .
you know what he needed to do back then ?
he needed to stop fine ass ingrid bergman from gettin ' on the plane with the corny dude .
and then , he gonna walk off in the fog with some other dude .
come on , man .
with another dude , in the fog ?
come on .
2 grown men walk off in a fog , you don' t know where they goin ' ?
think about it , man .
you smoke too much grass , man .
i hope you don' t think you walkin ' off noplace with me , man .
matter of fact , let me sit over here .
don' t fight it .
i' m not here with him .
i came by myself .
i' m a solo artist .
i' m doin ' my own thing .
security .
a' ight , we got a new joint for y' all .
i want you to check this out .
new millenium recording artists ren and ten .
# hey , yo , ren #

and thanks for coming by .
go ahead .
ok .
thank you for coming by .
# i can fix it up right quick ... #
how many ?
# listen , y' all ... #
i don' t think so .
hey .
what the hell is this ?
i said to give me space and then you pull this stuff ?
what ...
what are you talkin ' about ?
guess what demo i heard for our unsigned underground review today .
are you serious ?
dre , don' t act like you didn' t plan this .
you know the editor does the unsigned reviews .
why would i need to plan ?
i could have just given it to you at any time .
i was hoping it got the xxl
' cause the shit' s tight , not ' cause i know you .
well , i' m not doing the review .
i gave it to gabe .
why' d you give it to gabe ?
i gave you money to help start the label .
doesn' t the conflict of interest seem obvious ?
all right .
well , what did gabe say ?
it wasn' t a bad review .
he dissed us .
he didn' t diss it .
he just wasn' t feelin ' it .
sid , you gotta step in .
you gotta do your thing .
you' re editor .
i mean , you heard the cd .
i can' t do that , dre .
i can' t step on his review .
you' re the main person that' s talkin ' about hip hop losin ' its way , how we gotta get back to its roots .
what' s wrong with getting in touch with why we both fell in love with hip hop in the first place ?
' cause it' s about forward movement .
innovate and move on .
one minute you talkin ' about you want things to change , and the next minute you talking about you want things to stay the same .
i do want things to change .
i just don' t like how things have changed .
and ...
and i didn' t know this is how it would turn out .
and that' s why we need to look back , ok ?
' cause if we look back , it will make us see things ...
the mistakes we' ve made , things that we never knew were there before .
and if we just can stop ... then maybe we can find that thing ... that we both know is missing ... and build on that .
are we ... are we still talking about hip hop ?
that' s all we' ve ever talked about .
it' s all we' ve ever known ... from when we were 10 .
sid , just do me a favor .
before you do something you might regret , just ... just listen again .
just listen again .
and just follow your heart .
and whatever you decide ... whatever you decide is cool .
whatever you decide is cool .
dre ...
dre .
i' ve made my decision .
you ain' t gonna change your mind ?
what about your heart , sid ?
sid ?
hey .
can i get you something , sir ?
yes .
macallan 25 , neat .
hey .
hey .
you smell nice .
uh ... you gonna have to treat me ,
' cause i can' t afford that shit no more .
here .
please .
you couldn' t afford it then , remember ?
i had to keep playing if i was gonna get your number .
damn .
i lost nearly $200 that night .
yeah , yeah .
dre ...
so , what ... why' d you , uh ... why' d you call me here tonight ?
so we could have a drink , laugh on our good times , and , uh , act like none of this ever happened ?
yes and no .
i went to a divorce lawyer today .
and ... he asked me one simple question .
have we tried to make it work ?
are you serious ?
dre , let me finish .
we never tried .
we just assumed it was over ,
like we were in high school or something .
but we' re not .
we' re married .
we took those vows , dre .
you broke those vows .
come on .
i know that you and sidney have something very special that you share .
i also know there' s a reason you made me your wife .
and i ... and i' m hoping that whatever that reason is , it' s enough to make you want to keep me as your wife .
oh , reesey .
i do .
i love you .
but i think we both know that this can' t work .
i don' t know if we have enough of ... what it takes to ... to make this last .
i don' t know if we ever had enough .
we can' t stay married .
another round ?
damn .
well ... at least ... stay a while and have a few drinks and ... have a few laughs .
i hope you realize this means that i have to take half of everything you have .
let me make it easy on you .
here' s my little $58 . 25 now .
kelby ... sorry i' m late .
i' m sorry .
well , we missed the show .
i' m sorry .
i just got caught in the middle of this tug of war between dre' s label and xxl and ...
i don' t know what to do .
i feel so helpless .
kelby , we can see the show on saturday .
yep .
will you wait up a second ?
how long are you two gonna play this game ?
what are you talking about ?
what am i talking about ?
you don' t want to get married .
i love you .
but not the way you love him .
i' m sorry .
i don' t know why your heart doesn' t do what your mind tells it .
you don' t know .
i' m sorry .
# lying here #
# how bad i feel #
# the clock tick #
# and i think of you ... #
i always thought , one day i would outgrow my relationship with hip hop .
# confusion #
# is nothing new #
i never thought it was a fad , like many .
# flash back #
# all night #
but i never thought it could grow and mature .
# almost left behind #
# suitcase #
# of memories #
# time after sometimes #
# you picture me #
# i' m walking #
# too far ahead #
# you' re calling to me ... #
i thought it would be an adolescent memory
i' d look back on ,
like a crush on the captain of the football team .
but i realize we have more than that .
much more .
we have a history ... a friendship .
we listen to each other .
we laugh together .
we finish each other' s lyrics .
i don' t have to pretend with hip hop , and hip hop doesn' t have to pretend with me .
# you will find me #
# time after time #
my feelings have never been more clear , and i know they will never go away .
# i' il be waiting #
to hip hop .
# time after time #
# mmm mmm ... #
# mmm mmm ... #
wait .
didn' t i already see you ?
mm , yeah .
so what are you doing back here ?
i know that y' all put a new song in rotation every week .

i' m gonna show up every week till you take a serious listen to this cd .
then i' m gonna come back every week until you put this here cd into rotation .
