so i' m gonna get a three to one return on my money ?
otto is the real deal .
i met him at a hash bar in amsterdam .
he speaks russian , german , arabic ...
mr. ostroff' s trust is not gained easily .
two years it took me .
you see , micky , he doesn' t like new faces .
so tell me , why am i looking at a new face ?
otto krieg , meet my friend , bobby .
he' s helping me with the finance .
he' s not a cop .
let' s see the money .
you like it ?
yeah , i like it .
we have deal ?
we have deal .
bring ' em down !
move !
move in !
this is the fbl !
put your hands on your head !
what is this ?
you brought a cop , and he brought his fucking friends !
don' t look at me .
this is not good .
my father will kill me !
you' re under arrest for the importation and sale of contraband firearms .
scheisse !
gun !
drop the gun !
drop the gun !
whoa , whoa , whoa !
otto !
this is not my deal .
this is not my deal !
i don' t even know these guys !
cease fire !
holy shit .
holy shit .
bobby !
bobby !
stay down !
i' m calling it .
it' s 1 : 37 am .
bag him and ship him .
god , i hate this job .
give me a hand , fellas .
yeah .
all right , frank .
we gotta get you outta here .
what the hell happened ?
who' s the kid ?
definitely not in the plan .
but we beat the spread .
this isn' t football .
it' s a figure of speech .
people weren' t supposed to die out there .
get them ided and get them to the morgue .
and get me my pants !
can we get some pants over here ?
ah , shit .
surprise !
to frank castle ... the finest soldier , the finest undercover op , the finest man i' ve ever known .
what am i gonna do without you ?
get a girlfriend .
have fun in puerto rico , man .
say hello to your folks .
thanks .
agent weeks .
he' s robert saint .
howard saint' s son .
more paperwork for tampa pd .
no , we can handle this .
see you , buddy !
see you , fellas !
bail him now .
bring him to the club .
don' t hit me .
don' t hit me .
hey , micky .
don' t hit me .
you sell homegrown pot by the ounce , micky , not by the barrel .
you sell badly forged , fake passports to haitians .
so what inspired you to become ... the mr. universe of international arms dealers ?
you should apologize for the death of mr. saint' s youngest child .
okay , i know how it looks ...
but bobby , he buys pot from me .
and when he found out what i was doing , he insisted on coming in .
he put up half the cash .
he came of his own free will .
if you' re gonna kill me , will you leave my face alone , for my mother ?
we just made your bail .
if i wanted to kill you , i would have left you in jail where we have friends , and in some way that i can only describe as deeply pornographic , you would have been killed .
but you' re a small piece of shit , and i don' t want the karma of your death on my soul .
but on the other hand , maybe i don' t believe in karma ,
so guys ...
no , i' il tell you what i want to know .
i want to know one thing only , who brokered the deal ?
his name is otto krieg .
and if it' s any comfort to mr. saint , he' s dead too .
well , it' s not .
it' s actually no comfort at all .
but what might be comforting to me , is to watch the slow death of the man who was supposed to be taking care of my son , and making sure that he did not get into trouble .
now , micky ... what would your father think of this ?
your father gave his life for me .
what would he say ?
i didn' t know it was gonna happen like this .
please !
well , ignorance is no excuse .
the man who is responsible for my son' s death must die .
i told you to never let him out of your sight .
mr. saint , bobby told me to stay .
tell him , john .
john !
mr. saint !
it was bobby' s idea !
he wanted to go alone !
he thought he could impress you .
thank you for that explanation .
my son didn' t need to impress me .
more boxes , guys .
this was a hard one .
this was the last one .
it' s over .
tell that to your son .
he doesn' t believe me .
where is he ?
you know .
you know what i miss most about buck ?
he could catch a ball , no matter how hard you threw it .
he was right there .
why are we always moving ?
this is the last time .
you said that last time .
i did ?
yeah .
you said we were leaving california and we were gonna move to virginia , and you' d work in washington ... and we' d never move again .
i guess i' ve said a lot of things , huh ?
so why london ?
london' s a safe place where we can all be together .
no more more moving around , i promise .
some day when you' re older , will ...
i' il tell you why we had to move so much .
he was such a special boy .
are you identifying this body as your son , robert saint ?
he deserved better .
somebody lied to him .
promised him one thing , gave him another .
do you know that i used to have to dress him till he was 13 ?
i' d tie his ties , and comb his hair ...
i' il have to get him a new suit .
who is otto krieg ?
who are the people who work for him ?
who are his friends ?
who would stand to make money from this deal ?
tell me .
we can' t talk about the case , mr. saint .
now , i understand your grief , but for your own safety ,
leave this to professionals .
professionals .
yes ...
i' il do that .
i' il do that .
good bye , son .
we called new york , we called las vegas , we called europe and hong kong , we even got the sicilians in it for old time' s sake .
with what you' re paying howard , we' il know everything about otto krieg within 24 hours .
high five .
come on .
that was cool !
leave it .
we' il be back .
race you ?
yeah .
got anything left ?
i don' t see it !
come on !
he did his free ascent on the first try .
i' ve seen navy seals do worse .
that' s what we like to hear .
i' m so proud of you .
good job , babe .
hey , frank , is that that candelaria ?
yeah , manuel .
people around here call him a witch doctor .
he lives on that island way off the point .
only one damn fool i know crazy enough to swim over there .
gee , let me guess .
this is the first family reunion we' ve had in five years .
and that' s too long .
that' s too long .

and i' m really sorry ...

hey , hey , hey .
i married you .
i knew what i was doing ... and i' d do it again .
you and i , we' re not lucky , we are blessed .
i' il see you at home , son .
his name' s frank castle .
senior agent .
just got the bureau' s london desk .
his alias , connections , apartments in europe , none of it was real , not even his death .
well , maybe it was .
maybe ... he died and came back to life so he could die again .
you have your chance .
he' s leaving for england next week and he' s at a family reunion in puerto rico .
i think you should be there so you can come back and tell livia how he died .

i asked you to avenge our son and you did .
thank you .
vaya con dios , castle .

it' s really loud .

bye , joan .
bye .
this is undignified .
you' re supposed to be dead .
let' s talk .
stay away from me , castle .
i have friends , you know ?
let' s talk about your friends .
make you own friends , buddy .
i' m not saying nothing .
i talk to you , they' il kill me .
you don' t help me , i' il kill you now , mick .
the saints tell me nothing .
nothing ?
they pay your rent ... your legal bills ...
you should know something .
what' s the torch for ?
2, 000 degrees , mick .
enough to turn steel into butter .
it won' t hurt at first .
it' s too hot , you see ?
the flame sears the nerve endings shut , killing them .
you' il go into shock ... and all you' il feel is ... cold .
isn' t science fun , micky ?
i don' t know shit .
you' il smell burning meat , and then ... then it' il hurt .
i swear i' m telling the truth !
son of a bitch !
oh , my god .
should we call the police ?
let' s stay out of it .
he' s a very scary man .
he' s killing someone and we' re next .
exactly .
wait , wait !
smell that , mick ?
i' m burning off some of your fat .
i' il tell you anything , anything , anything you want to know .
that' s a good boy .
okay , okay .
any discussion of howard saint' s business involves two cubans ... the toro brothers .
they control all the prostitution and gambling up and down the gulf coast ... tons of cash .
they give their dirty money to howard saint , who transports it in cigarette boats to his banks in gran cayman , washes it and wires it back clean as a whistle .
for the love of god !
you are not a nice person .
so what' s up , you' re gonna string up howard saint and blowtorch him ?
i like that idea ...
but i have something better .
guess what ?
you' re gonna help me .
unless you want to stay howard saint' s lackey for the rest of you life .
i hate the saints .
all of them .
tell me about them .
what they do , where .
when .
howard saint' s a man of strict habits .
he has first tee time five days a week at tampa springs .
never fails .
he likes money , he likes power , but the thing this guy covets most , the wife , livia .
what happened to your family ...
howard did that for her .
she' s just like him , and she' s just as predictable .
every thursday , she works out , gets her nails done and goes to the movies .
howard knows every move this broad makes .
any man who looks at her wrong , he ends up in tampa bay .
let' s not forget johnny boy , the son you didn' t kill .
what a putz .
last but no least ,
quentin glass .
been with howard 20 years ... the family consigliore , lawyer , cpa and a sadist .
who knows what' s going on with this guy ?
yes ?
pop , you are not going to believe this .
no , i think i might .
chief morris , will the budget cuts mean less officers on the street ?
thank you .
thank you .
what impact will all this have on police layoffs ?
castle ?
frank castle ?
hey , i thought you were dead .
wait , hold them .
where have you been ?
it' s been five months since my family was killed , and i don' t see one man in jail .
obviously you' re upset .
upset ?
is that the word ?
i used to get upset when i had a flat tire .
i used to get upset when a plane was delayed .
i used to get upset when the yankees won the series .
so if that' s what " upset " means , then how do i feel now ?
if you know the word , tell me , because ...
i don' t .
taxi !
enrique , qu pas ?
get up .
wheel the money out .
fill that up .
you know whose money this is ?
you know whose building this is ?
howard saint' s .
he' s going to fuck your life up .
he already fucked my life up .
now , out the window .
what ?
out the window .
good business , murder ?
did saint pay for each one , or does he get a group rate discount ?
our top story this morning , a double homicide in downtown tampa .
two men were gunned down in the lobby of the saint building ...
frank castle is alive and back in tampa .
you may remember , castle' s the fbi agent presumed dead ...
he speaks six languages , he did two tours and 12 special ops ctu .
what' s ctu ?
counter terrorism unit .
at this hour , tampa police do not have a motive and no arrests have been made .
that' s the latest news at this hour ...
it' s him .
hi , there .
i just want to say that i' m very happy that you' re all here , very proud that you' re all here .
i guess i' ve said a lot of things .
we' re not lucky , we are blessed .
maria !
how is he still alive ?
i don' t know , quentin .
i wasn' t there .
why is he still alive ?
that' s an interesting question .
maybe he' s still alive because he was meant to suffer more .
i don' t know .
but how can we make him suffer if we can' t find him ?
he' s daring us .
no , no , he misses his family and he wants to die .
he' s asking for help , so let' s help him .
did the toros call ?
they' il be here tomorrow morning .
you invited them to this house ?
they invited themselves , howard .
mike , joe .
welcome .
let' s get a drink .
we don' t have time for that , howard .
oh my god , this weather .
yeah , just a little polluted , don' t you think so ?
i' ve seen hurricanes .
i' ve seen it rain like cats and dogs .
but never in all my years have i seen it rain hundred dollar bills .
yeah , this rainmaker , castle , he was supposed to be dead , no ?
yeah .
guys , look ... come on ... been working together for 10 years .
first time anything like this ever happened .
at a personal loss to us of $50 million , howard .
that' s one time too many .
do you want us to find another banker ?
no .
okay .
look , we want our money back , all right ?
and we want protection on the next shipment .
do you guarantee our money this time ?
with everything i' ve got .
in 48 hours , castle is a memory .
a pro from memphis .
the best .
come on , joannie .
open up the goddamn door , you fucking bitch !
i want to talk with you now honey , you' re hurting my feelings .
joannie , open up the goddamn door !
you' re hurting my feelings , you bitch !
hmm , dude ?
it' s kind of late .
yeah ?

joannie , come on , baby , let me in .

and the speed ?

no one' s ever stood up for me before .
come on , champ .
let' s get some ice on that .
come on .
frank kicked his ass , huh ?
he' s fine , he' s all right .
i ...
i' ve lived in seven cities in seven years and ... in each one , i' ve managed to find the one guy who will treat me the worst .
but i' m trying to fix that .
you' re castle .
used to be .
we saw you on tv .
i don' t have one .
i' m joan .
dave' s the one with all the ... the metal .
and bumpo' s is the ... well , you can probably figure out which one bumpo is .
we are really sorry .
about what ?
about your family .
did you know them ?
no .
i' m over it .
don' t let your memories kill you .
they won' t kill me .
glass .
quentin glass ?
who is this ?
i have certain photographic studies of you and your boyfriend .
meet me at the bar , at the wyndham hotel .
bring $5, 000 , and i' il give you the photos .
you wouldn' t want howard saint to see them , mr. glass .
thank you , sir .
have a good night .
quentin is late .
do you know were he is ?
i have no idea .
have you seen your mother ?
it' s thursday , pop .
right .
movies .
mr. saint ?
i know where mr. glass is .
i saw him pulling into the wyndham hotel a couple of hours ago .
howard ?
come here .
i was just telling quentin about the movie .
where have you been , quentin ?
i' ve been looking for you .
i dozed off out by the pool .
that' s funny .
what' s funny ?
micky said that he saw you at the wyndham .
micky should have his eyes checked .
so he' s mistaken ?
yes , howard , he' s mistaken .
oh , my goodness .
these pancakes are really good , joan .
what' s he been doing for the last few days ?
drinking .
a lot .
good morning , sir .
sit anywhere you like .
i can hear what you' re thinking
all your doubts and fears
and if you look in my eye
in time , you' il find the reason i' m here
and in time , all things shall pass away
in time , you may come back some day
to live once more
or die once more
but in time , your time will be no more .
do i know you ?
i know you .
you' re that boy in the newspaper , came back from the dead .
i didn' t catch your name .
you like that song ?
i wrote that for you .
i' m gonna sing it at your funeral .
you are one dumb son of a bitch .
bring a knife to a gunfight .
ms rpido , ms rpido !
come on , let' s move .
let' s move !
all of it ?
all ?
look at this , joe .
this is what i' m talking about .
don' t touch me , cojones .
don' t tell the toros , till we have a plan .
look at this place .
isn' t it beautiful ?
howard , we had chicken a la havana tonight .
very tasty .
don' t touch the cubans .
have you heard the news ?
a shipment of cash was torched at malaqui .
whose money was it , huh ?
our mother always put her cash in the mattress , which i thought it was a good idea till the house burned down .
it was a big fire .
she lost everything .
that' s what happens when you don' t watch your money .
you lose everything , howard .
everything .
14 shipments are perfect .
one went bad and i get this , why ?
because you want to scare me ?
there' s no insurance in this business .
you know that .
so i' m not covering you fucking losses .
i' ve got more guns than you do .
it' s not even cuban , howard .
it' s honduran .
they' re animals .
with all due respect , we don' t have more guns .
it' s my duty to ...
it' s your duty to make castle dead !
i don' t care what it takes , what it costs .
call the russian .
hi .
mr. castle , we need you help right now , because the guy who' s after joan is in her apartment ... right now .
we want you to have dinner with us .
i know it' s not thanksgiving , but um ...
i' d like us to all say what we' re thankful for .
i' il start .
i' m thankful to be alive this year .
and to have a job .
and to be sober .
yeah , i' m thankful for my mom ... getting out of jail .
you know , it' s cool .
and this girl gave me her number ... which is also cool .
thanks for leftovers .
i' m full .
thanks for diet pepsi .
and thanks for good neighbors .
thanks for dinner .
there' s dessert .
ice florentine .
you have to try my ice florentine .
come on , dave .
come on .
i need your help .
no , no .
i' il do that .
i know what it' s like .
i know what it' s like to try and make your memories go away .
you can make new memories .
good ones .
good memories can save your life .
i' m not what you' re looking for .
la donna mobile
qual piuma al vento
muta d' accento
e di pensiero
sempre un' amabile
leggiadro ...

felice appieno
chi su quel seno
non liba amore

evening , quentin .
howard .
what are you doing here ?
jim bowie .
excuse me ?
you know , jim bowie , the colonel ... the man who died in the alamo ... had a knife named after him .
he was a gambler .
and when he was accused of cheating at cards , what he would do is take the guy in the other room , move the furniture like so ... then he' d take his knife , he' d throw it in the ground ... and the one that left ... got the money .
gee , i didn' t know that , howard .
the only problem is that you have too much furniture .
i' m not following this .
i' m accusing you .
of what ?
cheating .
i' ve never taken a cent from you .
where were the two of you going to do it next time , the wyndham ?
two who ?
you and the whore .
i don' t know what you are talking about .
you' re good .
you should have been a stage actor .
maybe next lifetime .
what are you doing ?
you better pick up the knife , quentin .
if you don' t , i will .
i don' t need to grab a knife , howard .
this isn' t funny , howard .
whoa !
what ?
what ? !
how long have you worked for me ?
you think i' m an idiot ?
have you lost your mind ...
you were my brother .
i gave you everything , didn' t i ?
but it wasn' t enough .

don' t , don' t , don' t do this .
howard ... you' re killing me .
you' re killing me .

why are you killing me ?
why are you killing me ?
what the hell are you doing ?
i know about you and quentin .
quentin ?
you went to the movies last thursday , 8 : 00 ?
yes .
then at 9 : 00 , you called him from your car ?
must' ve been a short movie .
howard , there' s an explanation .
i know , i know .
you' re fucking him .
you' re fucking my best friend .
that would be a little hard to accomplish , howard .
oh , so true .
so true .
howard .
you should really learn to pay your parking tickets .
what ...
you thought we ...
howard ...
quentin was gay .
you' d say anything !
i don' t know what happened .
would you just talk to me ? !
howard , howard .
howard .
you have to listen to me .
please , howard .
please , howard .
do you recognize the neighborhood ?
little cuba .
just think , the first time i saw you was only three blocks from here .
look at me , howard .
of course then , the neighborhood was much more colorful .
look at me .
howard , please .
please , howard .
now it' s just for whores .
you' il fit right in .
look at that rock !
look at it !
take a look !
i gave you that when i had nothing .
all i asked for in return , was loyalty .
i have been loyal to you , howard .
you' re not making any sense !
i' m not making sense ?
here , look at this .
i found that in quentin' s bed .
does that make enough sense for you ?
huh , huh ?
no .
me neither .
i' d like to go to the club .
i need a martini .
$50, 000 a piece .
and $50, 000 more to the man who kills him .
if you accept this money , you are in till it' s over .
where have you been ?
huh ?
where' s quentin ?
oh ... well , he' s wrapped up in something .
i called home , no one was there .
your mother' s gone .
what ?
she took the train .
frank castle is dead .
he died with his family .
in certain extreme situations , the law is inadequate .
in order to shame its inadequacy , it is necessary to act outside the law , to pursue ... natural justice .
this is not vengeance .
revenge is not a valid motive , it' s an emotional response .
no , not vengeance ... punishment .
hey , eddie , more champagne on the double .
coming right up .
stop !
you look like a strong kid .
you must work out .
ever try isometrics ?
this antipersonnel mine weighs eight pounds .
not much .
well ... try holding it with an outstretched arm .
hell of a workout .
don' t leave me like this .
don' t leave me like this !
help , please .
howard saint .
howard saint !
you took everything from me .
you killed my son .
both of them .
i made you kill your best friend .
i made you kill your wife .
oh , god .
and now i' ve killed you .
you' re right , good memories can save your life .
when dave gets out of the hospital , check the cupboard .
i left something .
for all of you .
you' re leaving ?
i have work to do .
read your newspaper every day .
you' il understand .
which section ?
obituaries .
those who do evil to others ... the killers , the rapists , psychos , sadists ... you will come to know me well .
frank castle is dead .
call me ...
the punisher .
one , two , three , go !

i' ve thrown away , i' ve thrown away again
standing all alone
i' ve thrown away , i' ve thrown away again
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
pulling back the skin , it happens , we' re getting older
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
it' s all the same , but in the end
it keeps me coming
i' ve blown away , blown away again
the fear of failing
i' ve blown away , blown away again
the lies that make me sane
i' ve blown away the chance to make it right
i want to be , i want to see
i want to make it back to me
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
pulling back the skin , it happens , we' re getting older
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
it' s all the same , but in the end
it keeps me coming
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
pulling back the skin , it happens , we' re getting older
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
it' s all the same , but in the end
it keeps me coming .
i wanted you to know
that i love the way you laugh
i want to hold you high
and steal your pain away
i keep your photograph
and i know it serves me well
i want to hold you high
and steal your pain
because i' m broken
when i' m lonesome
and i don' t feel right
when you' re gone away
you' ve gone away
you don' t feel me here
anymore
the worst is over now
and we can breathe again
i want to hold you high
steal my pain away
there' s so much left to learn
and no one left to fight
i want to hold you high
and steal your pain
' cause i' m broken
when i' m open
and i don' t feel
like i am strong enough ...
