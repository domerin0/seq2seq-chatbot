wake up .
baby' s spotted two machines heading in fast .
i see them .
they' re runners .
think you can handle them ?
watch me .
okay .
i' m in .
that runner' s smarter than we' ve seen so far .
it' s quite a catch .
thanks .
will it ... ?
do you think it' il convert ?
to convert is its choice to make .
do you think maybe we ought to reprogram it ?
no .
we can' t make slaves of them .
because that would be simpler .
we won' t beat the machines by making them our slaves .
better to let them join us by choice .
make them believe the right choice is the one we want them to make .
all right .
yes , machines are tools .
they' re made to be used .
it' s their nature .
to be slaves .
that' s why we can show them a better world , why they convert .
but that world we show them isn' t real .
it doesn' t matter .
i' m afraid they' il figure out that we' ve made up the thing in our heads .
they can' t tell the difference .
to an artificial mind , all reality is virtual .
how do they know that the real world isn' t just another simulation ?
how do you ?
i know i' m not dreaming now because i know what it' s like being in a dream .
so dreaming lets you know reality exists .
no .
just that my mind exists .
i don' t know about the rest .
okay , he' s good to go .
looks like we are too .
dreaming already ?
he' s had a rough day .
you poor baby .
would you mind ?
not at all .
hello there .
what' s happening ?
sentinels .
let' s go !
come on , damn it , help me !
