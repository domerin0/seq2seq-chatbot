where' s the first family ?

left yesterday afternoon .
what' s the murder weapon ?
it' s not as clean as a knife .

it' s not big enough to be scissors , so it' s something smaller .

whose orders ?
what was she doing here so iate ?
you' re not cleared .
who invited you here ?
we did .
sir , he' s a d. c. homicide cop .
if i' m not mistaken , what i see over there is a homicide .
but jurisdiction ...
it can go to hell .
i' m in charge of white house security .
i' m the president' s national security advisor .
a murder 40 yards from where the president sleeps . . . . . . is a matter of national security .
alvin jordan .
harlan regis , homicide .

the government doesn' t close because it' s friday .
yes , i understand .
do you know how many people were in the white house ?
31 .
31 ?

the words are " woman " and " murder .

i guess he figures i' il be easier on you than some rookie with acne .
i' m an agent for the united states secret service .
which means i can answer questions relating to white house security .
i resent the implication ...
you resent the implication ?
people don' t speak english in this town anymore .
detective , it' s this way .
i know that .
no statement about ... . . . what' s happening in the white house .
the first family is at camp david .
as you can see behind me , the immediate area has been sealed off .
sheldon tercott , cnn , at the white house .
so why kill someone from the office of protocol ?
maybe she sat some ambassador in the wrong seat .
they kill you for that now ?
it' s a tough town .
if i' d known , i' d have put a turnstile in and charged admission .
who else was here ?

i' m a homicide cop in the homicide capital of the world .
it' s cheaper than a shrink .

the whole thing .
my father was a history buff so he kind of rubbed off on me .

this doesn' t ieave the room .
it was here we saw the image of an untroubled president ... ... before the white house murder cast a dark , cloud ... ... over this once highly regarded administration .
cory alan luchessi , janitor .
nobody can account for him during a 45 minute period . . . . . . prior to when the secret service found him in the east room at 11 : 02 .
the time of her death is set . . . . . . between 10 : 30 . . . . . . and 11 : 00 .
he eats a doughnut . . . . . . then stabs her 8 times .
lee harvey oswald was seen in the book depository cafeteria drinking coke . . . . . . a minute after kennedy was shot .
he' s reading soap opera digest .
2 months ago . . . .
that' s not enough .
if that' s all you got , you got nothing .
except this .
it was found in the bathroom .
it' s the missing button . . . . . . from a shirt in luchessi' s apartment .
luchessi doesn' t clean the bathrooms .
all right , where is he ?
being picked up .
what would it take for me to see the surveillance tapes ?
not much .
just an act of congress .
after you , detective .
that button was iabeled as found in the dining room .
how did it get in the iavatory ?
i labeled it wrong .
did you kill her ?
did you have an affair with carla ?
never .
but you came on to her , right ?
you did come on to her , yeah ?
did you come on to carla town ?
i came on to her .
i mean . . . . . . did you ever see her ?
she' s hot .
you take it further than that ?
no .
listen to me .
carla . . . . . . was strictly hands off .
what do you mean , hands off ?
i don' t know .
but then , that was the word .
the secret service . . . ... was look, ing out for her .
how ?
i don ' t k, now .
lik, e if she work, ed late , say ... . . .
11 o' clock , 12 o' clock . . .
. . . the secret service guys . . . . . . they would always drive her home .
don' t want that , don' t want that .
that !
this is an act of war .
this is the pueblo revisited , and he wants to negotiate ?
give me a break , !
neil negotiating to defend us at a table !
he can ' t even defend his own house .
where' s your rider at ?
how did you get down here ?
you want to iive . . . . . . open the door 2 inches and slide your weapon out .
don' t make me stain my iinen .

it' s a nasty ass city , regis .
congratulations , you are now a statistic .
let me see that .
son of a bitch !
so they' re eavesdropping .
big surprise .
it' s the government .
look . . . .
they brought you in on this ... ... for the same reason they brought dallas doctors in to work , on kennedy .
they go the extra mile so no one' il say they couldn ' t have done more .
you never would' ve let me hold luchessi on what they have .
you k, now that .
all right , go tak, e another look , at it .
but don ' t mak, e any fuck, ing noise till you have something real .
yes , sir .
come on , carla .

this is full frame ?
the machines automatically crop .
can you get me closer to this ?
no problem .

was the first family involved ?
can i have a fruit juice , please ?
aren' t you the . . . ?
the speaker of the house .
how you doing ?
good , thanks .
do you ever speak to anyone at the interstate commerce commission ?
they' re some organization , i' m not really sure , but they' re evicting me .
excuse me , mr. speaker . . .
. . . the detective is needed elsewhere .
don' t worry about it , i' il call you .
what' re you doing here ?
trying to find you .
the task force is closed .
we have a suspect .
yeah .
me too .
who' s that ?
he' s secret service .
you should know .
i can' t tell you .
is that classified too ?
yes , it is .
then i' il have to find out for myself .
there he is .
the one who just stepped to the podium .
what' s his name ?
i can' t tell you that .
either you help me or i' il find out the loud way .
please .
what' s his name ?
burton cash .
who' s he assigned to ?
kyle neil .
the president' s son ?
ladies and gentlemen . . .
. . . it is an honor to present the first lady of the united states . . . . . . mrs. kitty neil .
if the bodyguard was there , that means kyle was on that boat as well .
kyle neil was having an affair with carla town .
he had sex with her that night .
agent chance , right here , right now .
i' ve got to go .
how iong before the media finds out . . . . . . that the president' s son was banging her an hour before she died ?
i' ve got to go .
nice dress .
you are to have no further contact with detective regis , understood ?
what if he initiates contact ?
i want a report , detailed and immediate .
written ?
beginning with what you two just discussed right now .
kyle !
we used to date .
then you know how it works .
i think you should get revenge .
excuse me ?
you should get revenge .
how do i go about getting that ?
move to new york , become a model and don' t take his phone calls .
interesting .
i need a drink .
like one ?
your treat ?
sure .
what would you iike ?
whatever you' re buying .
bourbon ?
nice .
after 2 bourbons , she' s telling me that his one mission in iife . . . . . . is to get iaid in every room in the white house .
it sounds iike a plan to me .
she even told me . . . . . . kyle once bragged about sharing a mistress with his father .
carla town ?
she wasn' t sure who .
it gets better than that .
her uncle' s company , brookland associates . . . . . . is the ieading east coast fundraiser for jack neil .
really ?
the company who ieased the president' s campaign space owned her apartment .
this is good .
this is very good .
i hope you know what you' re doing .
good night .
good night , dear .
do you want to see my badge ?
why' d you come here ?
so i' m digging . . . . . . going through people magazine , and just happen to come across page 16 .
i find a picture of kyle coming back from brazil . . . . . . and you standing next to him with an earpiece .
i must' ve iooked at 1 8 months of pictures of the guy .
you know what i found ?
i found you were in over half of them .
you didn' t say you were on his detail .
until when ?
i' ve nothing more to discuss with you about this .
the case is closed .
agent chance , when did they remove you from kyle' s detail ?
you show up grilling me about work ?
answer the question .
don' t come here again .
answer me !
you expect me to violate every oath i' ve taken ? !
i have a duty to protect !
your duty could send an innocent man to prison for iife !
are you comfortable with that ? !
i think you should ieave .
how did spikings find a button in the bathroom no other detective found ?
did he plant it there ?
i asked you to ieave .
did he plant it ?
i don' t know , okay ?
everybody' s iying around here .
so , again . . . . . . why did they remove you from kyle' s detail ?
they didn' t remove me .
one night . . . . . . l heard sounds . . . . . . of violence , fighting . . . . . . in his apartment .
so i went in .
and i found him . . . . . . beating up his girlfriend .
he was ugly .
and they . . . .
we . . . . . . covered it up for him .
that was even uglier .
that' s when i asked to be reassigned .
look , i don' t know what i would do if i was you .
but i know i could not iet an innocent man . . . . . . fry for something he did not do .
maybe you can .
get neil out !
bring our soldiers home !
get neil out !
testing .
1 , 2 , 3 .
north korea has brok, en off negotiations .
a dark cloud seems to be hanging over this administration .
the fbl has not been able to interview the first son . . . . . . now said to have been in the white house at the time of the murder .
i have this to add to the carla town effects .
could you open it , please ?
thank you , agent chance .
no problem .
go on through .
hello ?
any problem ?
no , i finally found everything .
you done ?
spikings wants to see you .
now .
anything i should know about ?
i don' t know .
is there ?
you were in the olympics .
you know about being a team player ?
sharpshooting isn' t a team sport .
this is .
we put our iives on the iine . . . . . . every single day .
you must trust your co workers .
is there a problem ?
you tell me .
this case is closed .
so i' ve heard .
harlan regis hasn' t .
you would tell us if he tried to contact you , right ?
of course .
good .
because if anybody found out . . . . . . he' d elicited your support . . . . . . for his paranoid theories . . . . . . i' d hate to think how it' d iook .
what people might think . . .
. . . as a team .
why' s the door shut ?
excuse me ?
why are your hands on me ?
because if anyone walked in . . . . . . i' d hate to think how it' d iook , what people might think .
as a team .
this day and age , they might get the wrong idea .
agent chance examined carla town' s effects 8 minutes ago .
get her .
and cooper . . . . . . do it quietly .
nina chance , find her and iock her down .
cover the stairs , i' il take the front .
we got a visual .
i got it .
cover the front !
your approval ratings dropped 19 % .
your point ?
the point is that it' s enough to distract anybody .
from a sober judgement ?
i can' t defend my own house . . . . . . so how can i defend america ?
we' re a superpower , let' s act iike it .
so is china . . . . . . which , iast time i iooked , had a pact with north korea .
we can handle china . . . now .
10 years time , at the rate they' re arming , who knows ?
mr. president . . . . . . let' s bring the boys back .
we can go in with special forces .
general tully has a point .
poll in today' s new york , times , jack .
53 % of americans ...
think we should strike the north koreans .
the vice president' s point amplifies mine .
i' m not going to war over this .
i want the 7th fleet to stand down , not turn around . . . . . . stand down .
that doesn' t bring them back to the table , we' il reconvene .
thank you , mr. president .
you may be prepared to sit here while they torture our boys , i' m not .
we' re not being passive .
we' re being patient . . . . . . and prudent .
it' s my duty to tell you your iack of action is almost criminal .
then you' ve done your duty .
now i' il do mine .
i expect your resignation on my desk in the morning .
you shall have it .
that' s all , gentlemen .
what' s wrong ?
here .
it' s from carla' s answering machine .
right .
how' d you get it ?
i stole it .
look , here' s what you need .
in her appointment book . . .
. . . she has a meeting scheduled for tomorrow in new york .
craig nisker and associates ?
he' s the king of tell all .
his agency sold 5 of the top 10 scandal memoirs of all time .
that' s his motive .
i' il be damned !
the oval office threesome .
he figured she' d burn the whole family .
she' d score big with this .
i guess kyle found out about it .
we can place him at the scene .
and he had history of violence against women .
that' s it .
he' s mine .
you just don' t get it .
these people can make us disappear .
i' ve got to go .
where ?
i checked into a motel .
i' il call you .
be careful .
the court may direct what ?
mr. peterson ?
under 2198 . . . . . . of the criminal code . . . . . . the court may allocate a fine for the children of the victim .
please , what is it ?
the porch iight' s on , but nobody' s home ?
or the victim' s spouse .
incorrect .
the court may direct the fine be paid to the female seduced . . . . . . or her child , if she have any .
where testimony in rape prosecution concerning clothing of defendant was ...
what is it ?
heavy date ?
yeah .
that' s pretty funny .
what' s going on ?
i just need your car , all right ?
get off of me !
easy , easy !
you are a son of a bitch !
i' m going to have your badge .
why didn' t you shoot her if you had this ?
you know who i am ?
i don' t give a shit !
you' re going down .
turn around .
get off of me .
get over here .
just iike a big fish , fell right for the bait .
only guilty men do that .
or one who' s being framed .
you had sex with her , then offed her .
oh , jesus !
you think it was an accident she was murdered after i slept with her ?
someone knew i' d be with her .
someone with a motive as good as yours .
what motive ?
did your father have sex with carla ?
i don' t know my father' s sexual rsum .
you knew she was ieaving town .
yeah , i read newspapers .
2 nights in new york , then to the virgin islands , and a rental car .
carla town didn' t have a driver' s iicense .
you think i killed carla ?
think you can prosecute me ?
your arms don' t reach that high .
so why did you show up ?
i go to sleep every night thinking of a woman with 8 stab wounds .
a woman i slept with an hour before .
try that as a sleeping pill .
you forgot something .
rivaling the korean hostage tak, ing as an issue for the white house ... ... the murder of carla to wn remains unsolved .
as the attention of homicide detectives turn to kyle neil . .. ... and the president' s approval ratings drop ... ... we must ask ,, will this be jack , neil' s chappaquiddick , ?
no one k, nows where the trail will end .
but for an administration deep in the troubled waters ... ... of a potential confrontation in north korea ... ... a serious domestic concern ... ... is especially dangerous to the president' s public image .
if jack , neil cannot protect the work, ers under his own roof ...
coffee ?
come on , regis .
sorry i' m iate .
what' s wrong ?
what is it ?
they were there .
who was where ?
the president and the first lady .
they were in the white house when carla was murdered !
how do you know ?
that morning i almost shot their dog .
they never go anywhere without it .
i saw footage of them coming back from camp david with the dog .
their alibi is complete bullshit !
they took them to camp david after the body was found .
spik, ings .
he could' ve smuggled them out .
how ?
the tunnels under the white house .
i built this city , remember ?
i just can' t believe this .
they covered it up , got them out .
why ?
because then they would be considered suspects .
why shouldn' t they be ?
that' s the question .
because he' s the president .
what does that mean ?
he doesn ' t have a motive ?
he has a mistress about to drop a tell all .
that' s motive enough .
wounds are from the left .
president neil is right handed .
yeah , i noticed that .
he writes with his right hand . . . . . . but he swings a baseball bat and golf club with his ieft .
jesus !
she' s still there .
do you want me to finish this ?
no , they' re right where we want them .
we' re right on schedule .
thanks , regis .
i appreciate it .
i can take care of myself .
i want you to iay iow until i get to jordan or spikings .
secret service .
back door !
move !
get them !
go !
go for the gas tank .
he' s clear .
what about nina chance ?
you want the spotlight ?
become a rock , star !
i' d reassign you , but it' d make more news !
come in !
call for you , regis .
i' m not taking any calls .
it' s the white house .
how iovely for you !
that was some stunt you pulled .
last night had nothing to do with me .
i was off duty .
that' s difficult to believe .
i don' t care what you believe .
if the president was in residence that night , why didn' t you tell me ?
the president' s not to be involved .
the president is about to be an official suspect .
suspect ?
i must question ...
you won' t question the president !
the presidency is an institution , not a person .
and that institution will be protected at all costs .
why do you think we got him out ?
to cover up a crime .
to keep the smell of blood from north korea .
we' d never get our boys back .
this is global , detective .
it' s a bit off your turf .
it' s a homicide !
it is my turf !
let me tell you . . .
. . . i' ve known jack neil for 3 decades .
i' m godfather to his son .
your suspicions are iudicrous .
luchessi' s a stooge .
then prove it .
how ?
nobody can pinpoint the time of death .
he can' t prove where he was .
27 cameras cover the hallways of the white house .
are you telling me none of them saw her within 3 minutes of her death ?
are you trying to tell me ?
the tapes are classified .
out of my reach .
you republican or democrat ?
i think washington is drowning in a sea of its own bullshit .
those 13 men aren' t risking their iives over bullshit .
it' s not about 13 men .
it' s about a dead woman in the white house .
a harvard study . . .
. . . measured a man' s iongevity by what he reads first in the paper .
i' m an obituary man .
start with comics , you' il iive ionger .
whoever ieaked this , i' m going to bottle their iast breath !
if she was alive at 10 : 49 , she was murdered well after ...
this changes nothing about luchessi .
no one saw him until 11 : 02 .
that still gave him 13 minutes to do the job .
so , regis . . . . . . what are you going to do ?
put the president in a iineup ?
you' re carla town , you' re about to sell this story . . . . . . move to paradise , so you buy a one way ticket , right ?
this is sears for carla to wn , confirming monday between 8 and 12 ... ... to install the trash compactor you bought yesterday .
why have a trash compactor installed after you' re gone ?
maybe she forgot ?
but she just bought it the day before .
shit !
monday , 4 : 30 .
you' re right .
what ?
wait a minute .
and the handwriting on the 23rd ?
the slope of the writing is different .
here , iook at this .
the ioop on the l is smooth and continuous .
in the day planner . . . . . . there' s an obvious pause . . . . . . which indicates a deliberate stroke .
it' s on the b. . . . . . as well .
it' s a forgery .
there never was an appointment .
she wasn' t going anywhere .
spikings . . .
. . . entered at 12 : 09 . . . . . . left at 12 : 14 .
yes , sir .
surveillance tapes .
he had clearance .
thank you .
bob !
yes , sir ?
i want to talk to detective regis , d. c. homicide .
he' il want to question spik, ings .
get me his address in alexandria .
someone' s playing us iike puppets .
what are you saying ?
carla town wasn' t killed to protect the administration .
she was murdered to destroy it .
what do you mean ?
someone dumped a dead body in the white house . . . . . . so the trail would iead to the neils .
they even manufactured the motive .
so ?
only the guard k, new i took , the tapes .
so you have someone on the inside .
let' s stop playing games .
sit down .
do you know what it takes . . . . . . to stand all day in one place . . . . . . watching a dumpster in the rain . . .
. . . because it' s next to a hotel . . . . . . where the president is staying the next day ?
when his iife is in your hands . . . .
loneliest job in the world .
get rid of the wire .
i know who' s iistening anyway .
you think you got it all figured out ?
you haven' t read me right at all .
i see my iife and my service . . . . . . with a clarity . . . . . . you' re incapable of ...
shit !
shit !
cover me !
go !
you' re a sharpshooter ?
save it !
freeze china out if they stand with north korea .
all talks for a grain deal cease until they stand down .
if china wants grain , i want our boys back !
you got 5 minutes .
i' m afraid it' il take ionger than that .
it' s bad news , mr. president .
it' s still jack , alvin .
nick spikings is dead .
what ?
and he had evidence that kyle killed carla town .
spikings collected it .
they found a condom with kyle' s semen and the woman' s fingerprints on it .
they found the murder weapon . . .
. . . and the surveillance tape putting kyle and carla together . . . . . . minutes before the murder .
there must be another explanation .
spikings was about to cut himself a deal to ieak it .
nick spikings . . . .
he wouldn' t .
everyone has a price .
not the first thing in your iife you' ve been naive about .
obviously not .
you' re safe now .
so' s kyle .
spikings . . .
. . . was murdered .
see what we got .
jordan .
21 : 18 .
that' s 9 : 18 .
he goes out there .
we got a special on that model .
back off !
sure .
only a couple ieft though , just so you know .
8 : 16 he comes in .
can even throw in a universal remote with that .
back off !
sure , sure .
take your time .
just ask for jack .
he comes in and then he ieaves with ...
who' s that ?
i know that guy .
he' s the guy at spikings ' .
the 31st name ?
jordan walked him in .
jordan set up the whole thing .
the investigation into the white house murder has resulted in 2 suspects .
the car ... ... a burgundy chevrolet caprice , is the possible suspect car .
there won' t be anything anyone can prove .
all the evidence will be destroyed .
what do you want ?
your resignation . . .
. . . effective 10 p . m .
i don' t know why you iook surprised .
tully was right when he called it criminal .
because we didn' t attack ?
you think that' d save our boys ?
you have failed !
you have failed your office pitiably .
i' ve seen your cowardice grow from the beginning .
finally , not having served your country in the military . . . . . . you had no idea of the time honored code . . . . . . of never ieaving a man on the field of battle .
you should have brought those boys home !
dead , wounded or otherwise .
you should' ve done it by force if necessary !
any president who serves up his country as appetizers for the enemy . . . . . . isn' t fit for this office .
so the choice is yours .
you can resign . . . say it' s due to your health . . . . . . and tour the best golf clubs in america .
or you can stay in office and watch your son destroyed .
the choice is yours .
if any father can call that a choice .
why didn' t he just kill neil ?
it' s easier to kill the secretary than the president .
besides . . . . . . alive and ruined is better .
than what ?
than dead and martyred .
and now , this special bulletin .
an oval office address is scheduled for 10 : 00 tonight .
sources say the president will resign .
jordan played his card .
that gives us 2 hours to get to the president .
are you insane ?
how ?
we' il use the tunnels they used to get out .
you don' t know where they are .
but you do .
you know the security and the iayout .
you' re crazy .
why , because i' m helping a government that' s evicting me ?
you got no argument there .
we got to get rid of this car .
don' t say my name , just iisten .
remember where we had the double homicide 2 week, s ago ?
meet me there in one hour .
get down .
cops .
two .
that' s the steam grate .
it' il take us to one of the three points vulnerable to penetration .
eisenhower put a water filtering system down in there .
there must be an alarm .
there is .
it goes off across town , the general services building .
no white house or secret service .
response time ?
officially , 5 to 7 minutes .
but realistically , 10 to 11 .
by that time , we' il either be fired or we' il be dead .
what do you think ?
meet and greet time ?
good evening , officers .
tense night in the big city .
could be this thing with the president maybe ?
nice to know that we have our men in blue out here to . . . . . . keep watch over us .
this has got to work .
didn' t that senator iay the wood to that stripper around here somewhere ?
all right , take it easy this evening .
just asking .
didn' t see it on my guide map .
we' il see you iater .
all right , gentlemen .
come on !
go !
be careful .
come on !
my grandmother moves faster than you .
wait .
where are we ?
we' re under the mall .
that' s pennsylvania avenue .
it' s not far .
now what ?
end of the iine .
this is the old emergency water system .
these pipes go through the wall .
that' s where we' re going .
after you' re sworn in . . . . . . you' il salute neil for his service to his country .
you' il ask for the country' s prayers , for bipartisan unity .
would you two excuse us now ?
thank you .
gentlemen , at 2400 hours . . . . . . president dylan will sign off on the raid into north korea .
look for a steel door .
army corps engineers .
these are escape tunnels .
built in case the confederates iay siege to the white house .
who says history isn' t practical ?
we' re running out of time .
you first .
you hear that ?
christ !
go ahead , i' il be okay .
we got to cross over .
in less than an hour ... ... jack , neil will step down after a little more than 2 years in office .
for cnn , i' m doris macmillian .
let' s do this .
wait .
we' re here .
motion sensors .
they trip an alarm in the white house .
set it off , we' re surrounded by agents .
how iong ?
1 0 seconds .
we' ve come too far to turn back now .
i' il hold them off as iong as i can .
movement in 102 .
repeat .
movement in 102 , subsector 11 .
tunnels .
tunnels , subsector 11 .
you' re under arrest !
drop your weapon !
cover sector 12 !
freeze !
on the ground !
get on the ground !
clear sector 7 now and report back to me only .
let' s go !

hold it !
let' s see i. d.
agent , gun !
the janitor !
get him !
he killed spikings !
mr. president . . . . . . kyle' s innocent !
you can' t be here .
i am here .
seal the corridor .
i am still the president !
seal the corridor !
jordan , you' re under arrest . . . . . . for conspiracy in the murder of carla town and nicholas spikings !
you may remain silent !
anything you say can be held against you in a court of iaw !
you have the right to an attorney .
if you can' t afford one , you prick . . . . . . one may be appointed to you .
how' d you get in ?
i crawled .
he gave spikings the evidence on your son .
i have you on tape . . . . . . with carla' s murderer .
the same man who put a bullet in spikings .
stand him up .
don' t believe me , iook at the tape .
it' s in my back .
carla was killed to destroy you . . . . . . to force your resignation .
then jordan had spikings shot because he saw the tape .
arrest him .
not him .
him .
my god , alvin . . . . . . you had her killed .
i think teddy roosevelt said it best .
lf i must choose between righteousness and peace . . .
. . . l choose righteousness .
she was 25 years old .
she was a child .
she was a casualty of war .
mr. president !
get him out of here .
thank you , son .
just stay easy .
stay easy .
i' m right here .
hold on .
there' s absolutely no truth to any of those rumors .
at no time was president neil planning to resign .
the murderer of carla town is dead .
he was killed as he fired upon authorities arresting him .
in that same gun battle . . . . . . national security advisor alvin jordan . . . . . . and senior secret service agent nicholas spikings . . . . . . were also killed .
did the killer penetrate the white house with the objective of killing miss town ?
in 180 years , there' s never been a penetration of the white house .
president and mrs. neil will have a statement iater .
thank you very much .
call d. c. homicide , tell them the detective is on his way to the hospital .
paramedics say he' il be fine .
how is she ?
she' s stable .
you saved my iife .
thank you .
and detective . . . . . . how can i ever repay you ?
don' t bother .
just doing my job .
well , there is one thing .
yes , detective ?
you know the interstate commerce commission ?
sure , secretary randall' s office is down the street .
down the street ?
see ?
it' s not what you know , it' s who you know .
what are you doing for dinner ?
sero .
