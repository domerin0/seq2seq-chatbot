time .
time , it has been proposed is the fourth dimension .
and yet , for mortal man , time has no dimension at all .
we are like horses with blinders seeing only what lies before us .
hear , hear .
forever guessing the future and fabricating the past .
it' s him .
who ?
brilliant .
quite right , your grace .
how , you ask , can we lift these shackles and live not in the moment but in the glorious expanse of time' s continuum ?
listen , and i shall tell you .
the secret lies in the enduring power of our achievements our creations !
as the pyramids testify to the egyptians so my glorious erection shall represent our culture in perpetuity .
behold , rising before you the greatest erection on the continent .
the greatest erection of the age !
the greatest erection on the planet !
hold this .
of course .
for the herald , your grace .
i understand you' il be making an important announcement tonight .
good afternoon , ladies .
please , excuse me , please .
good afternoon .
and the perrier jouet should be chilled .
you understand ?
chilled .
yes , sir .
leopold !
leopold , where have you been ?
leopold !
otis , i demand explication !
it' s half past 5 : 00 !
he' s not even dressed !
he' il be ready , my lord .
i assure you .
i don' t want him ready .
i want him resplendent !
ah , miss blaine .
you dance like a ...
like a herd of cattle .
you are a rare woman who lights up a room simply by leaving it .
might you be rich , miss blaine ?
you see , whilst i am the third duke the little secret of those of us in the royal court apart from our general uselessness i i s our massve indebtedness .
it' s always been your misfortune , leopold that you so thoroughly amuse yourself with the sound of your own voice .
in a life as stagnant as mine that i can amuse myself at all is an evolutionary marvel .
hmm .
please don' t touch that .
the device you were jabbering about .
to take priests to the bell tower .
to take anyone , uncle , to the floor they so desire .
buildings continue to climb .
soon they will outstrip the stamina of our legs .
you speak of progress and invention .
yet what i offer you downstairs is reality .
take a wife .
marry .
marriage ... marriage is the promise of eternal love .
as a man of honor , i can not promise eternally what i have never felt momentarily .
born into privilege , yet perversely ashamed of it .
that is your tragedy .
my god !
if my brother could only see you , he' d be heartbroken .
you are no duke !
of course i' m not .
the monarchy is dead , uncle .
we are relics .
that is reality .
the new royals are men of accomplishment .
men like roebling , with his bridge
edison , with his lamp
diesel , bell , westinghouse ...
those men made themselves from nothing !
you , on the other hand , were born with everything and from it , fashioned nothing .
as of tonight , i wash my hands of you .
take a good look at your dance card , leopold .
a wealthy bride is your only surety .
your grace , may i present miss tree of the trees of schenectady , sir . of the trees of schenectady , sir .
miss tree ?
it' s an honor to be making your royal acquaintance , your highness .
shall we ?
# #
many dreams , all useless .
who are you ?
uh ...
no , no , no .
okay , rela ...
please , wait , no .
i don' t want to harm you .
stop !
please !
sir , wait !
pardon me .
pardon me .
go !
go !
ya !
ya !
ya !
# #
stop , sir !
please !
oh , my god .
no !
oh !
let go !
just let go .
it' s okay !
you don' t understand !
let go !
oh !
i don' t want to hurt you !
let go !
goddamn it !
whoa , whoa ...
oh ...
bart !
wait !
shit !
ow !
oh , my god .
we must remember , bart that sometimes it is okay to color outside the lines .
hello ?
my palm pilot .
you still have it .
kate , it' s 1 : 00 in the morning .
and clearly you' re awake , so what is the infraction ?
look , kate , i don' t know where your palm pilot is .
and i can' t do this right now .
not now .
i' m expecting a call .
oh , bart.
oh , i' m sorry , baby .
she is not a happy person .
goddamn it !
you know what , stuart ?
you know what ?
i' m ...
kate ...
stuart ... ?
please .
i' ve got somebody here , okay ?
i know .
i saw her .
no , you didn' t .
yes , i did !
it' s a him , if that' s any kind of consolation to you .
so , look , now that you know
i' m not getting laid , just go to bed , okay ?
nuh uh , don' t .
do not hang up on me , stuart .
don' t do that .
kate , please .
i beg of you .
something big is happening .
something that validates my entire life ...
something that validates your entire life .
what could that possibly be ?
are you sitting down ?
yes .
no , you' re not .
yes , i am .
no , you' re not .
ye ...
okay .
i found it .
what did you find ?
the portal .
a crack in the fabric of time .
it was over the east river , kate just where i said it would be .
you found the portal ?
a portal into april 28th , 1 876 .
i jumped off the brooklyn bridge and took a walk in 1 876 today .
i followed the duke of albany around old new york .
are you listening ?
avidly .
this here' s the twist , kate .
here' s the kicker .
what' s the kicker ?
he followed me home .
the duke of buffalo ...
no , the duke of albany . ... albany followed you home through a crack in time .
he' s a brilliant engineer .
he patented the counterweight pulley .
he invented the elevator , for christ' s sake .
you know what , stuart ?
you know what ?
i' m not your girlfriend anymore .
i haven' t been for a whole month now .
you can tell me the truth .
i am telling you the truth , kate .
you can tell me you went and picked up a transvestite in times square .
i don' t care .
you know what , kate ?
this is it , right here .
this is it , in a nutshell .
our downfall .
you never not once believed in me .
oh , i did , stuart .
i did , for four years .
and i got burnt .
okay , you want to know who he is ?
i' il tell you who he is .
he is a hacker .
high end .
english .
i know him from columbia .
he' s in town for the mac expo at the javits .
we went out , got a little sloppy on guinness and he passed out on my couch .
and that' s the truth ?
mm hmm .
that' s the truth .
okay ?
are you happy now ?
is that plausible enough for you and your little focus group ?
you know what , stuart ?
i blew my best years on you .
those were your best ?
look ...
i' m sorry .
i have to go .
you' il get your pilot in the morning .
# #
orange alert .
oh !
otis !
otis !
bart , stop !
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
where am l ?
well , um , there' s not an easy explanation for that .
if it' s a ransom you seek , my uncle won' t pay a cent .
except , perhaps , for my demise .
no . no .
you' re not being kidnapped .
bart , quiet !
i can scarcely see , thanks to your spray .
my eyes feel like
steak au poivre .
so i ask you again , where the hell am l ? !
as far as i' m concerned , you might be jack the ripper !
and you would have me believe that i' m being detained at present in the hereafter ?
the time to come ?
yes .
bart , quiet !
he needs a walk .
oh , and you would have me believe that you have found a crack in time .
you , of all people , should understand .
i mean , you' re a scientist .
you invented the elevator .
what is an elevator ?
what the hell are you talk ...
where the hell am l ? !
i told you you haven' t actually gone anywhere .
you' re still in new york .
that , sir , is not new york !
i' m afraid it is .
no , kate .
hello .
hello there .
what' s your name ?
what' s your name ?
leopold .
tell me something .
i' m having trouble with my g 5 .
how much ram do i need to properly run os 9 . 6 ?
clearly , the mac expo is out .
so you must be ... a man out of time ?
or sergeant pepper ?
you know what ?
actually , we could use a little privacy .
stuart , i want my palm pilot .
i' m not ...
i' m serious .
maybe later on , kate .
i just want my palm pilot , stuart !
no .
no .
hey , give me my palm pilot !
give it to me .
this is madness .
this is madness .
who was that ?
l i feel as if i' ve seen her ...
women have changed since your time , leo .
they' ve become dangerous .
it' s on the landing !
you say this is no kidnapping .
you say you mean no harm .
then why is it , sir , you will not unlock the door ?
i' m sorry , okay ?
i' m sorry about her .
i' m ...
look , with all due respect
i can' t let you just go running around free out there , okay ?
this is new york city .
it' s not such a safe place anymore .
look at you .
you look like some sort of psychotic escapee from a renaissance faire .
i understand you have some anxiety but you have to trust me .
i' m going to get you home , okay ?
i promise .
bart !
the portal opens up again next week .
monday .
i know that , because it was my back up in case
i didn' t make it last night .
it' s on a cycle , you know ?
kind of like , uh ... total eclipse .
once every 20 years .
you understand ?
generally , i understand everything .
since i' ve met you , nothing .
i can only assume i' m in a nightmare brought on by agita , or else i am dead .
you' re not dead .
come here .
sit down .
here .
want some milk in yours ?
bart , can i just have ...
sorry .
he' s he' s really got to go out .
look here .
uh ...
i' d be honored if you took a look at those .
um , i' il explain everything when i get back .
he' s got to go out or he' s going to drop a bomb in there .
come on .
let' s go .
back in five .
one quick trip to spectra , bart and you and i will be nobel ...
laureates .
come on , bart.
hey , let' s go .
come on .
let' s go !
oh !
oh .
oh , jesus !
good boy , bart !
stay !
stay , bart !
stay !
oh , bart , please stay !
# #
stuart you forgot the pointy thing !
stuart ...
look , this is not complex .
he gave me the palm pilot but he forgot the pointy thing .
i' ve been warned about you .
oh .
really ?
and what , pray tell did the great disappointment say ?
that you were dangerous , though you hardly look it .
oh , really ?
a lady in trousers isn' t dangerous , merely plain .
i take it you' re a career woman .
yeah , market research .
mm .
fine avocation for women , research .
perfect for the feminine mind .
huh .
you' re a trip , lionel .
i myself once courted a librarian in sussex .
oh .
good for you .
aha !
i must confess
i feel as though we' ve met i i on a prevous occason .
well , lionel , seeing as
i' ve never met a single friend of stuart' s
i' m not even sure he' s ever had any
i really don' t see how that' s possible .
oh , man !
bart !
he just made lake erie out there .
you just can' t toss a dog out into the hall like that .
you can' t do that .
i assure you , i did not .
let' s go .
i beg your pardon ?
come on .
let' s go !
bart ...
look , pal , i don' t care how many elevators you got .
this one' s in my building .
hang hang on a second .
sorry about the elevator , miss kate .
i' ve got them on the phone right now .
hey , gracy .
this is lionel , stuart' s friend .
how do you do ?
ten minutes ?
i need someone here right now .
watch it , man .
i beg your pardon .
hey , what are you doing ?
you need to be going that way .
there' s an electron ...
hello ?
hello ?
there' s an electronics store .
hello ?
i' m sorry , miss .
there' s a patch of grass across the street .
take him there .
he' il do his business .
can you give this to stuart , please ?
it' s his cable bill .
they haul our furniture and cradle our children but this morning , from the battery to the bronx elevators have mysteriously ...
so sorry .
stupid !
i do beg your pardon .
i beg your pardon .
are you going to remove that ?
i beg your pardon ?
pick it up and put it in the trash .
absolutely not .
maybe you don' t understand .
it' s against the law to leave it there .
are you suggesting , madam , there exists a law compelling gentlemen to lay hold of canine bowel movements ?
i' m suggesting you pick the poop up and throw it away now .
i refuse .
respectfully .
all right .
what' s your name , fancy pants ?
leopold ...
alexis elija ...
walker thomas garrett
mountbatten .
all right , stuart .
have a nice day .
i appreciate you putting in a good word for me but j. j. ' s not back from london .
right .
bye .
what' s with the elevators ?
it' s happening everywhere .
darci .
last page .
i' m sorry .
did everyone live happily ever after ?
he lost his leg to gangrene waiting for her on the island .
but they' re together now .
wonderful .
oh , look , you got your palm pilot back .
a nightmare .
okay , so who do i owe ?
okay , bobby at hasbro .
reeves at crunch .
and the finals came in for " love for sale .
the call with the studio' s at 4 : 00 .
the margarine thing' s in 1 5 in the conference room .
j. j. wants to talk to you before that .
oh , and one more thing .
i remember that you told me to start thinking ahead so i know your brother' s getting back from his retreat tomorrow and if you want something in the fridge ...
darci ...
mm hmm ?
can you tell me why i' m upset right now ?
because , uh ...
j. j. called this morning .
that is why i have a cell phone .
so you can call me ...
kate , kate , he didn' t call .
he just popped his head in here and spoke two sentences .
so he' s back ?
margo says he' s going to make a big announcement about the merger next week .
margo ?
what does she know ?
how does she know anything about anything ?
oh .
all right .
so he popped his head in here .
all right , so you have to tell me exactly what he said , darci .
you have to start at the beginning and tell me ...
he said , " tell kate i' m going to sit in on farmer' s bounty .
j. j.
good morning , kate .
good morning .
i' il see you in there .
good lord , it still stands .
the world has changed all around it but roebling' s erection still stands !
that , my friend , is a miracle .
what ?
it' s a miracle , man !
it' s a bridge .
tell me ... when did they adapt it for steam engines ?
the fire brigade .
i don' t know how it happened .
i found him in a shaft .
stuart !
leopold , what are you doing out here ?
get back inside !
one , two , three .
they' re taking him to goodman memorial .
fresh creamery butter .
is there anything more comforting ?
there is and i know you will agree when you try farmer' s bounty with the essence of real butter in every bite . with the essence of real butter in every bite .
your first choice .
however , 45 % of our demo circled " shifty " as his key descriptor .
not good .
this is what i say .
everybody should be trying
farmer' s bounty with the real , rich , creamy taste of real butter .
try it , and you will be losing pounds .
poof !
boom !
voila !
your second choice .
unfortunately , the group found him obnoxious , abrasive and a whopping 72 % found him just plain creepy .
the spot rolls out in four days .
we have to ...
what the hell am i supposed to do ?
we have to do another session .
tomorrow .
i had my assistant book the response room at national so we can decide then and there .
kate , are you all right ?
you okay ?
i' m fine .
geez , kate , i' d ask for a decaf .
monica , i need you to call barney' s .
i need a white blouse , size small in kate' s office by lunch .
oh , dear .
hi , you' ve reached stuart .
please leave a message .
leopold ?
leopold , look , don' t be frightened .
this is stuart , okay ?
is it bell' s talking telegraph ?
i saw a prototype at last year' s faire .
i need you to pick up the handset , leo .
you pick up the green handset , because i need to talk to you ...
are are you there ?
hello ?
leopold , thank god .
listen , they' re taking me to x rays .
everything' s going to be fine but you have to stay in the apartment , do you understand me ?
oh , stuart , i saw roebling' s bridge today .
i saw it ... complete .
yes , yes , but listen to me .
you can' t go out again .
you have to stay in the apartment .
stay in the apartment ?
for how long ?
leo , i' il be back tonight .
i promise no more field trips .
would you ...
hel ... hello ?
stuart ?
hello ?
blast !
hello .
hello .
who are you ?
hector .
my mom works late on wednesdays so i watch tv with stuart .
want some pirate' s booty ?
hang on .
excuse me , j. j. , i wanted to thank you for the shirt .
that was very nice .
come in , come in .
yeah .
uh huh .
absolutely .
oh , good , good .
yeah , she' s here right now .
i' il tell her .
okay ... okay .
bye .
sit down .
that was barry .
he was thrilled with your work at the screening last night .
oh , good .
good .
you' re a rarity among women , kate .
i' m sorry ?
you don' t cling to illusion .
you don' t get caught up in emotion .
you don' t do pretty .
i don' t ?
you skew male .
you' re like a man .
a man who understands women their desires , their needs .
you understand them but you' re not really one of them .
you don' t mind my being frank , do you ?
no .
i don' t .
no .
edamame ?
kate ?
but one day , he lowered the jolly roger
stu ? and set sail in search of another kind of treasure .
not money , not jewels , not gold ... but a bride .
despite his being a ruffian of the brine fearless in his plunder and merciless with the sword the pirate king was also lonely .
you see , he had never met a lady .
he never met a girl ?
no .
not a girl , not a lady , not even his own mother .
so what happened ?
as with all comedies the most ridiculous thing imaginable the pirate king fell in love with the major general' s daughter .
i had the good fortune to see the premiere last month at the fifth avenue theatre .
since when is penzance at the fifth ?
is it your habit , sir to simply enter a conversation without introduction ? to simply enter a conversation without introduction ?
whoa , you are deep in it .
it' s cool .
i' m an actor , too .
i' m charlie .
i live downstairs .
kate mckay , senior vice president .
darci , it hasn' t happened .
all he did was dangle a carrot .
until he makes a decision the pressure' s doubled .
when' s he going to make a decision ?
we' re having dinner tomorrow to discuss it further at commune .
kate ?
yeah .
i have stuart on the line .
no !
he says he' s in the hospital .
no !
leopold is just sitting alone in my apartment right now .
god knows what could happen to him .
do you know he got outside today ?
of course he did i made him walk your dog .
what ?
no , kate , you can' t do that !
he can' t go outside !
jesus christ , kate .
he' s from 1 876 , kate .
he doesn' t know our customs .
if something were to happen to him
it could be catastrophic .
shh !
if he doesn' t go back to april 28 , 1 876 , he doesn' t get married he doesn' t have children , and you want to know what ?
what happened with the elevators today , well that' s going to seem like a walk in the park .
stuart !
this is embarrassing .
it' s embarrassing now , all right ?
someone has to keep an eye on him .
stuart , he' s a grown man .
he' s a grown man .
he' s fine .
he can take care of himself .
no .
wait .
aah !
i' m going .
kate , please .
just take this to spectra , okay ?
get it developed .
you' il see i' m telling the truth .
tell manny it' s important .
you want double prints ?
that' s not funny , kate .
this is not a joke .
you need help , stuart .
you need help .
# ... square of the hypotenuse #
# i' m very good at integral and differential calculus #
# i know the scientific names of beings animalculous #
# in short , in matters vegetable , animal and mineral #
# i am the very model of a modern major general . #
charlie ?
hey , kate !
can i see you downstairs for a minute ?
i invited someone to dinner .
he' s up there all alone .
stuart' s in the hospital .
i didn' t think you' d have such a problem ...
no , you didn' t think , charlie .
you didn' t think .
you came home early , one day early from actor camp .
okay , it' s not actor camp and yeah , i came home a day early , all right ?
there was this tai chi broad who kept trying
stick her fingers ...
no , this is the point .
you immediately march upstairs to my ex boyfriend' s apartment and you invite his freakish friend ...
see , that' s what it' s about .
it' s not that i went up there .
it' s that it was your ex boyfriend ...
no , it' s not about stuart .
greetings , kate .
charles .
hey , leo .
be nice .
so , when' s stuart getting back ?
couple days , maybe a week .
he promised me that he would return late this evening .
well , maybe he will , leopold .
he' s so big on keeping his promises .
may i have the next course ?
there is no next course .
ha .
where i come from the meal is the result of reflection and study .
menus are prepared in advance timed to perfection .
it is said , without the culinary arts the crudeness of reality would be unbearable .
you shake and shake the ketchup bottle .
none will come , and then a lot' il .
what is that ?
i beg your pardon ?
why are you standing ?
i' m accustomed to stand when a lady leaves the table .
tell me , charles when stuart and your sister were engaged did you happen to read his papers on the temporal universe ?
i spent the morning perusing them , and must confess ...
stuart and i were never engaged .
not even close .
but i did read ...
thank you .
but i did read his papers however , to show support .
is stuart still trying to make a time machine ?
that' s the beauty of it he discovered no machine was necessary .
all one had to do was to develop formulae to forecast portals natural windows in the fabric of time .
apparently , stuart located one utilizing modern ...
ah !
utilizing modern theories of weather prediction .
what' s a portal ?
an opening which exists for but a moment .
this explains why one must jump through it from a height in order to achieve the required velocity .
the speed of gravity , to be exact .
it' s quite brilliant .
you are so method .
you don' t even break for a second , do you ?
it' s unbelievable !
oh , stop it , please !
no more !
stop , please ?
i beg you .
i' m tired .
can you go away ?
can you just go away ?
can you go away ?
she' s drunk , leo .
oh , shut up , charlie !
and you , can you go upstairs ?
can you go away ?
i am truly sorry if i have offended you in any way .
goodnight , charles .
goodnight , charles .
goodnight , leo .
what the hell was that ?
he thinks he' s from the 1 9th century , charlie .
he thinks he' s a duke .
i know . lsn' t that cool ?
no .
kate , he' s in character .
he is an actor .
oh , really ?
for what show ?
you know that just because someone doesn' t have i i a payng gg it doesn' t mean they' re not working on their craft .
what' s going on here ?
i think there' s something wrong with his , uh ...
thing .
give me that telephone .
no .
give it to me .
no , i need to ...
what do you expect me to do ?
you took away my cell phone .
they' re not allowed on hospital property .
i have to make a phone call !
you' re not going to make one now .
no , no , you don' t understand .
this is a very important phone call .
i have to leave this hospital now .
i can' t be here anymore .
mr. besser
i am tired of telling you this .
you are not going nowhere until dr. feinstein signs your release !
did you ever take any earth science , esther , hmm ?
you look like a smart woman .
ever hear of the time space continuum ?
sounds important , doesn' t it ?
well , it is .
and you want to know something , esther ?
it' s broken !
okay ?
and i' m the only guy who can fix it .
so why don' t you go down the hall there and get on your little telephone and call dr. feinstein ...
goodnight , mr. besser .
you tell him that ...
you tell him that i ...
point the toes , pull your shoulders back .
take a deep breath in and then exhale into downward facing dog .
oh , be quiet !
be quiet ... oh !
bart barking )
bart , shut up !
that thing is a damned hazard !
it' s just a toaster !
well , insertion of bread into that so called toaster produces no toast at all merely warm bread !
lnserting the bread twice produces charcoal .
so , clearly , to make proper toast it requires one and a half insertions which is something for which the apparatus doesn' t begin to allow !
one assumes that when the general of electric built it he might have tried using it .
one assumes the general might take pride in his creations instead of just foisting them on an unsuspecting public .
you know something ?
nobody gives a rat' s ass that you have to push the toast down twice .
you know why ?
because everybody pushes their toast down twice !
not where i come from .
oh , because where you come from toast is the result of reflection and study .
yes , you mock me .
but perhaps one day , when you' ve awoken from a pleasant slumber to the scent of a warm brioche smothered in marmalade and fresh creamery butter you' il understand that life is not solely comprised of tasks , but tastes .
say that again .
pardon me ?
did they start yet ?
yes .
session list .
leopold , darci .
darci , leopold .
i' d like him to read .
can you tack him on at the end ?
and , leopold , go with darci .
she' il take you to the greenroom and explain everything .
i need to work out .
i need a place i can work out .
if i could get mr. duke ?
is he ready ?
where is he ?
oh , my god , look at this .
let' s skip this one .
mr. duke , right here on the floor .
excuse me , that' s your mark , right there .
just stand on that tape line .
look , forget this guy .
i can' t waste any more time , j. j.
we need to make a decision now .
all right , we' ve got plenty of good choices .
let' s cut it off , kate .
that would be a mistake , j. j.
kate , the client wants to move on .
we should see this last guy .
it' il ...
two minutes !
i think he looks like the quaker oats guy .
well , phil , it' s really not about what you think .
it' s about what they think .
they' ve been in a coma all day and now look at them .
to them , this guy is a dream .
he' s handsome , honest , courteous .
stands when you walk in a room .
brings you brioche in bed .
if you eat his margarine maybe your hips will shrink and he' il come to your door .
i take it this is to be delivered in direct address as on geronimo .
geronimo ?
he means geraldo .
exactly .
okay , everyone quiet please .
and action .
start talking , bud .
fresh creamery butter .
is there anything more comforting ?
i say there is .
and perhaps you' il agree when you sample fat free farmer' s bounty with the genuine essence of creamery butter in every bite .
with every mouthful of farmer' s bounty you shall receive butter' s luxurious comfort in your mouth without adding to the luxury of your waistline .
not bad , kate .
where' d you find him ?
he lives in my building .
where do i sign ?
right here , and here .
oh !
hi .
that was spectacular , kate .
thanks , j. j.

nice work , mr. margarine .
thank you .

nice .
yes !

oh , you did so great in there !

you are going to be on a national television spot !
i take it you' re dining with that man tonight .
huh ?
oh , yeah , j. j.
he' s my boss .
you require a chaperone .
his intentions are obvious .
i' m alone with you .
do i need a chaperone ?
we' re not courting , kate .
if we were , as a man of honor
i would have informed you of my intentions in writing .
oh ...
good day .
hey !
kate , why don' t we take one of these .
they' re for tourists .
sorry , she doesn' t seem interested .
oh , hey , hello .
hello .
hey !
hey !

yah !
what do you think you' re doing ?
whoa , hey !
yah !
i warn you , scoundrel
i was trained to ride at the king' s academy and schooled in weaponry by the palace guard .
you stand no chance .
where you run , i shall ride and when you stop , the steel of this strap will be lodged in your brain .
your boyfriend' s a very good rider .
yeah .
are you for real ?
pardon me ?
are you for real ?
i believe so .
you' re a duke .
i was born a duke .
i' ve never felt like one .
stay .
sit .
on your feet .
stay .
stay .
good boy .
i' m off to dinner .
what are you two doing ?
i don' t know .
maybe we' il watch the rest of the game or go out or something .
oh , thank you .
kate , may i repeat my offer to serve as a chaperone ?
no , thank you , leopold .
charles , don' t you find this inappropriate ?
as her brother , i would think ...
as her brother , i would think that my sister would invite me to an audition .
could be just me , though .
seems kind , but ...
charlie .
hmm ?
you' re not exactly a margarine spokesperson .
i can' t sell butter , kate ?
i don' t mean to be insulting ...
it' s insulting .
i' m an actor .
you don' t have faith in me to sell butter ?
no .
no .
i' m sorry .
i can do british , kate .
i' m an actor .
i can be anybody !
you' re a very , very good actor .
i am a good actor .
you are .
okay , fine , all right .
a victorian dude who' s never seen a mets game watching tv .
okay .
scene i say , are those little people in that box of phosphorous ?
crikey , i believe it is !
this game' s more beguiling than cricket !
good golly , oh , jesus !
it looks like mike piazza just hit a game !
how about canadian ?
oh , right on .
right on , you like butter , huh ?
yeah , what' s that about ?
good night .
good night . ... all those people up in that stadium .
know what they probably could go for ?
some margarine !
when your friend walked in in that outfit
i was getting a little nervous for you there .
lf you eat his margarine , maybe your hips will shrink .
it' s brilliant .
you saved phil from his own ambivalence .
i knew it was the way to go in my gut .
i' m counting on that gut .
can i get a bottle of your ' 95 lynch bages and a bottle of evian ?
i' il tell you one thing your friend is going to be bigger than mr. whipple .
thanks .
you' re not sleeping with him , are you ?
no .
no .
leo .
leo , come on .
come here .
how' s it going , man ?
see the girl with the long brown hair ?
that' s patrice .
she' s lovely .
she' s mine .
congratulations .
hey , everybody , this is leo !
leo , this is everybody .
what' s up ?
dennis .
shelby , allison , monica .
and this , this is the insatiable patrice .
hey , charlie .
hey .
how do you do ?
patrice , let me assist you .
thanks .
you got it ?
i was going to get it .
let me get that for you .
there you go .
you look nice tonight .
very ...
like a judy blume book .
that' s good , because i thought for a moment that body of water here was a moat .
no , that' s a pond .
the gardens are devastating .
they are .
they' re very , very beautiful .
ooh .
you' il have to come and see them firsthand .
right , right .
after the merger
i' m going to be stuck over there , setting things up .
i' il be craving a little face time from my new top honcho in new york .
what are you saying ?
i' m saying you should come visit .
i' il fly you over for the weekend .
oh , yeah , i heard that .
the other part the part before that .
the part about the top honcho .
i didn' t understand that , that part .
how about catching an opera saturday ?
la bohme' s at the met .
okay , so she comes back the audience is about to leave she comes back on stage and she starts squirting the audience with this turkey baster filled with this pine mist .
and she' s screaming " un sex me !
un sex me !
but no tears .
just raw human passion .
lsn' t willem dafoe part of that group ?
yeah , and he did this monologue about how all the best things in life are hidden in people' s basements .
like the louvre .
i' m sorry .
you were saying , charles ?
just ...
no , what about the louvre ?
tell us what you were going to say .
well , only a fraction of the louvre is on the walls .
the rest is in the basement .
you' ve been in the basement of the louvre ?
oh , yes .
i was an art history major at vassar .
ah .
and so , what' s down there ?
well , that' s where the real show begins .
unspoiled by dilettante .
davinci , michelangelo , david , chardin .
allow me to assist you , patrice .
oh , let me light that for you , monica .
what , this ?
this is my family crest .
been in the family for ...
oh , in the basement ?
what do they have in the basement ?
why , the works of da vinci
michelangelo , chardin , david all surrounded by great coral sponges to absorb the moisture .
just for the record , i was working it .
i was in the zone and i would have gotten her number if you hadn' t turned the evening into a guided tour of the louvre .
my apologies .
let' s get one thing straight .
patrice , she thought you were cute probably gay and cute .
and cute , leo , that' s the kiss of death .
perhaps .
perhaps ?
certainly .
i believe this is her number .
as i see it , patrice has not an inkling of your affections .
and it' s no wonder .
you , charles , are a merry andrew .
a what ?
everything plays a farce to you .
women respond to sincerity .
this requires pulling one' s tongue from one' s cheek .
no one wants to be romanced by a buffoon .
now , that number rings her .
yes .
so ring her tomorrow .
i can' t .
she gave the number to you .
only because i told her of your affections .
whawhat did you say ?
merely that you admired her but you were hesitant to make an overture since you' d been told she was courting another .
shit .
that' s good !
whawhat did she say ?
she handed me the napkin .
charles , it' s quite late .
no , no , no , she won' t be home yet .
i get her machine , i leave a message ball' s in her court .
you' re ladling calculation upon comedy .
the point is , to keep the ball in your court .
you' re right .
you' re right .
okay .
nothing need be done till tomorrow .
tomorrow .
then i make my move .
an overture , charles .
make your intentions known .
think of pleasing her , not vexing her .
no vexing .
you' re intoxicated .
we should retire .
i' m sure kate will be home .
i doubt it .
but it' s nearly midnight .
you like her , don' t you ?
who ?
kate .
you do !
oh , charles , stop .
you like my sister !
well , you made your intentions known , right ?
right ?
you' ve been drinking .
leo , commune ... right around the corner .
we could stop in , you could give me a couple of pointers pull out a chair or two you could throw out a gesture here or there .
yeah , see , it' s one thing with patrice .
you don' t give a shit .
it' s a whole other ball of wax when it' s a girl you like , huh ?
yeah , who' s the merry andrew now ?
you want to vex my sister !
i have to confess that i' m a little bit confused .
um ...
no .
thank you .
when you asked me to dinner tonight
i was under the impression that we were here to discuss ...
the merger .
yes .
right .
yes .
and a possible promotion .
yes .
yes , that , too .
and , well , dinner is winding down and we haven' t really discussed anything even remotely relevant to what i thought we came here to ...
i don' t believe i' ve ever seen you this flustered , kate .
you haven' t even kissed me yet .
yeah .
right .
well ...
i like you , j. j. , i do .
i like you quite a bit .
um , as a matter of fact
i think you would agree that a working ... a successful working relationship requires a great deal of ...
what exactly is our working relationship ?
kate ...
hi , kate !
hi , charlie .
well ... what are you doing here ?
we just thought we' d come by
to say hi .
kate .
j. j. , right ?
right .
might i have a word with you ?
now ?
ln private .
no !
no .
mr. margarine .
please ... please join us .
and where did you say it is ?
ln sussex .
near ballmour .
yes .
built in the 18th century .
early 1 8th century .
really ?
are you quite sure ?
yes .
he' s got pictures , leopold .
perhaps you were swindled , because i can assure you as of the late 1 9th century there' s nothing but farmland near ballmour .
you' re mistaken .
that' s not possible .
well , it' s quite possible , leopold , that you are mistaken .
no , it is not .
... the only manor house in the county .
i know because i grew up there .
leopold , it wasn' t ...
leo , do you enjoy opera ?
i do .
and do you ?
oh , yes .
it keeps ... keeps me alive .
do you have a favorite ?
bohme .
la bohme .
la bohme .
i' ve seen it 1 2 times .
that' s ... that' s how i learned to speak french .
you speak french ?
fluently .
oh .
ah .
que ton visage est doux entour par la lumire de la lune .
what did he say ?
how sweet your face looks gently encircled by the soft moonlight .
oh , i like that .
from the opening scene of bohme .
a stunning duet .
andre sings it to mimi .
andre ...
i invited kate to the met next week .
she' s never been .
patrone is singing andre , and she turned me down .
can you explain that , leopold ?
well ...
la bohme is one of man' s great achievements and should not be missed .
but perhaps kate resists on moral grounds .
how so ?
should we get the check ?
well , some feel that to court a woman in one' s employ is nothing more than a serpentine effort to transform a lady to a whore .
oh .
j. j.
this guy' s charming , kate .
the duke of margarine thinks me a serpent .
no , he doesn' t .
no , not a serpent .
that' s too grand a word .
simply a braggart and a cad who knows less french than i , if that' s possible .
and by the way there' s no andre in bohme it' s rudolfo .
and though it takes place in france it' s rarely played in french , as it is written in ltalian .
good night .
sorry .
kate , might i have a word ?
# #
morning .
hi .
you want some coffee ?
no , thanks .
you want to read ... you want to read your paper ?
no , thank you , charlie .
i want to go to work and try and clean up this mess you made .
you sure you don' t ...
uh ...
kate ...
uh , kate !
what ?
l i just thought maybe you' d want a a kiwi for for for the subway .
that' s a papaya , charlie .
oh .
you' re right .
okay .
but while using the product 80 % found the product too soft to be ... effective .
this , of course , presents a conundrum for us marketeers .
how do we maintain a soft feel on the exterior of a plastic wrap or pack while retaining the useful tensile strength in the sheets ?
now , i' m going to suggest to the summer soft people to scale back to a limited release of the product in the mid atlantic states , where we can refine the product on the basis of extensive ...
dearest katherine ...
i behaved as an imbecile last night animated in part by drink , in part by your beauty and in part by my own foolish pride .
and for that i am profoundly sorry .
please accept as a gesture of apology a private dinner on the rooftop tonight at 8 : 00 .
okay , where are we on farmer' s bounty ?
kate ?
care to share with us ?
farmer' s bounty ?
where we are .
where we are is good .
um , as you know , we found our spokesperson .
the response room final showed a 96 in the top two boxes .
his key female descriptors ... were " handsome , " " romantic " with several write ins of ...
what a hunk . " with several write ins of ...
what a hunk .
great .
would you hold this ?
j. j. ?
j. j. , hi .
um , listen , i just want to apologize again for what happened last night .
there was no need for things to get that way .
i appreciate that .
so ... everything' s okay ?
yes , kate .
i didn' t jump ; i fell .
there' s a difference a subtle difference , but nonetheless a difference .
so how did you fall down there ?
because there was no elevator .
and you feel that was your fault ?
you know what , i' m sorry .
i got to concede that you are a very busy man and i' m sure there are plenty of people clamoring for your particular brand of attention .
unfortunately , i am not one of them .
so if you don' t mind , would you please unlock this door ?
i' m concerned you might be a danger to yourself .
and in such cases
hello ? ! state law requires that i keep you under ...
will someone please open ...
aah !
aah !
everything all right , dr. geisler ?
yes , gretchen .
everything' s fine .
stuart , i' m going to prescribe
stuart , i' m going to prescribe something called prolixin .
it' s a mild antipsychotic .
nothing too strong .
i was wondering ...
i was wondering if you would like to accompany me ...
lf you' ve already been previously engaged
i understand .
tonight at 7 : 00 , 7 : 30 .
please don' t be late .
i got to talk to you about this , okay ?
' cause there' s some shit here that just cannot be said .
did you assemble a bouquet for patrice ?
look , you just can' t tell a woman she' s ...
gracefully serene .
no , no , this will not do .
wha ...
why ?
what is wrong with this one ?
the orange lily implies extreme hatred .
the begonia and lavender danger and suspicion , respectively .
every flower has a meaning , charles .
might i suggest the amaryilis , which declares the recipient a most splendid beauty .
or the cabbage rose .
darci !
hmm ?
what is this ?
it' s a reply
to leopold' s invitation .
uh huh ?
you' re going , right ?
i haven' t decided yet .
oh , you haven' t decided if you want to have dinner on your rooftop with a duke ?
who thinks he' s from 1876 !
no !
and i would appreciate it if ...
kate , come on , okay ?
i don' t know what this guy did to piss you off but that is the best apology letter in the history of mankind .
just sign it , kate .
it' s 4 : 30 .
we' il fax it .
kate mckay' s office .
they hung up .
hi .
is patrice there ?
hey , patrice ?
hi .
it' s me , charlie .
hey , charlie .
i was just calling to find out if you got my flowers your flowers .
i was calling to see if you got the flowers i sent you .
yeah , i did .
and i was just wondering if you would like to go to a movie tonight and maybe afterwards perhaps accompany me to dinner ?
i mean , i ...
i understand completely if you' re otherwise engaged .
but , uh , you know , i just wanted to say that , um ...
yeah ?
i wanted to say that you' ve , uh ...
you' ve made an impression on me .
and and it it' s not just the way you look
i mean , which are great .
your looks are , you know , top top shelf .
but , uh ...
i don' t know , it' s , um ...
what ?
you' re graceful .
you know , the way you move and speak .
i mean , some people have a way with words and , you know , you ... you do .
the bottom line is , i like you .
patrice ?
what about 7 : 00 ?
7 : 00 ?
7 : 00 would be heaven .
okay .
see you then .
it worked !
it worked cool !
# who' s going out with patrice ? #
# charlie' s going out with patrice ! #
# charlie' s going over there . #
oh , better go get ready .
better go get changed .
shouldn' t change too much , though
' cause she likes me for who i am .
oh .
hey .
charlie , you look fantastic .
yeah ?
yeah .
i got a date .
i got to go .
bye .
bye .
kate ?
yeah ?
um , have a good time tonight .
bye .
my god .
this is beautiful .
the very word for which i was searching .
may l ?
she was a real romantic , my mom .
when prince charles and lady di got married , she had a party .
she made crumpets and jam .
it was like a super bowl party , but for moms .
she cried for a week .
i don' t know the story of prince charles and lady di .
oh , you don' t want to .
it' s a cautionary tale .
further proof .
of what ?
you can' t live a fairy tale .
i' m not very good with men .
perhaps you haven' t found the right one .
maybe .
or , uh , maybe the whole love thing is just a grown up version of santa claus just a myth we' ve been fed since childhood so we keep buying magazines and joining clubs and doing therapy and watching movies with hit pop songs played over love montages all in this pathetic attempt to explain why our love santa keeps getting caught in the chimney .
otis always told me love is a leap .
lamentably , i was never inspired to jump .
by my 30th birthday , i had , according to my uncle become a blemish on the family name .
so he brought me to this country with the proviso i marry an american .
a girl with a good deal of , um ...
charm ?
money .
since my parents died our family fortune had become , shall we say , depleted .
i would be married now if i hadn' t followed stuart .
i was to announce a bride that night .
who ?
i don' t know .
someone .
one of them .
what are you doing ?
i' m just cleaning up .
would you do me the honor of a dance ?
please ?
i am not much of a dancer .
you' re doing famously , then .
leopold , this was lovely .
but i don' t know if i can leap even if i am inspired .
people might think i' m brave , but i' m not .
the brave are simply those with the clearest vision of what is before them .
glory and danger alike and notwithstanding , go out to meet it .
hey .
morning , charles .
how was your evening with patrice ?
good .
nice .
how was yours ?
good .
nice .
so , leo , don' t you think it' s time you tell me who you are ?
what do you mean ?
the sequel .
i know she seems pretty tough but she hasn' t had it that easy .
she' s always getting stuck with people who don' t hold up their end .
like me .
i just don' t ...
i understand , charles .
you do ?
yes .
so ... who are you ?
i am the man who loves your sister .
okay , door' s open .
shut the lid .
push the drawers in .
close the door , and you push this button .
don' t press that till she wakes up .
so she sees you doing it .
oh , clever .
the proverbial tree in the woods .
if a man washes a dish and no one sees it ...
did it happen ?
right .
a cup of coffee , my dear .
thank you .
breakfast ?
nine grain toast with strawberries and mascarpone , madame .
it' s apparently low in polyunsaturates .
it' s really good .
it' s good .
what should we do today ?
oh no , no , no , no , no , no .
thank you .
no .
you know what makes me happy ?
you don' t look good in those .
they' re so completely inappropriate for you .
kate .
kate , kate , come .
leopold ?
leopold ?
hey , what are you doing ?
it boggles the mind that it is still here .
this is my uncle' s home .
well , was .
this is where i lived .
good lord .
a portrait of my parents ... and me .
uh ... uh , leopold ?
look , i just don' t think that we should just be barging around here like that .
leopold ?
my old quarters .
what are you doing ?
hey .
the place where i put everything i most cared for .
hmm .
things i didn' t want my uncle to touch .
my mother' s ring .
oh , it' s beautiful .
you know , i live on an island connected to everything by bridges and i never cross them .
i' ve lived here for ten years and i' ve never been to the other side of anything .
you' ve never traveled ?
no .
do you ...
what ?
do you miss where you' re from ?
in a way , i ...
i miss ...
i miss its rhythm .
it was slower ?
quite a bit slower .
like today ?
yes .
# wherever you' re going , i' m going your way ... #
do you hear that , leopold ?
do you hear that music ?
yes .
have you ever seen the movie
breakfast a tiffany' s ?
uh , no .
no .
not yet .
you see that guy down there with the light on ?
mm hmm .
he listens to the soundtrack of breakfast at tiffany' s every night until exactly midnight .
and then he turns his light off goes to sleep .
# my huckleberry friend #
# moon river and me . #
oh , that means it' s sunday .
oh , i don' t want it to be sunday .
i want more of this .
more 1 876 .
but , kate , you don' t work on sundays .
we can have more .
well , oh , no , ' cause sunday is the day before the day i work , so ... : it gets poisoned .
i see .
besides , tomorrow is the day we shoot your commercial .
kate .
hmm ?
would you ... ?
might you ever ... consider ... ?
hmm ?
it' s time for bed .
oh .
i' m so relaxed .
that' s all right .
oh ...
you' re tucking me in .
yes .
huh , you' re my otis .
yes , your grace .
oh , wait .
hey , hey , don' t ... don' t go upstairs .
stay .
# #
i love you , kate mckay .
scone , your grace ?
ah , thank you , millard .
and you brought the farmer' s bounty ?
but of course .
ah !
fresh creamery butter .
is there anything more comforting ?
i say there is and perhaps you' il agree when you sample fat free farmer' s bounty with the genuine essence of creamery butter in every bite .
with every mouthful of farmer' s bounty you shall receive butter' s luxurious comfort in your mouth without adding to the luxury of your waistline .
farmer' s bounty .
now , on this one take a bite and smile .
and ... cut !
all right , check gate .
good enough for me .
can we get a dedo up here and something ...
oh , excuse me .
excuse me .
is this an actual sample of farmer' s bounty ?
yeah .
why ?
this tastes like saddle soap .
well , that' s not really your concern , now , is it ?
not my concern ?
this product tastes like raw suet .
how is that not my concern ?
hey , pal , it' s a paycheck !
wait a minute .
paycheck ?
a ...
this is an outrage !
don' t worry about the taste .
come back .
we need another shot .
something that brings the light up on this ...
leopold .
leopold !
hey !
leopold , what' s going on ?
what are you doing ?
they they need you back in there .
do they ?
yeah .
they have to shoot the rest of the spot .
they' re not finished yet .
well , i want no part of it .
why ?
have you tasted it ?
farmer' s bounty ?
yes , farmer' s bounty .
yeah , i' ve tasted it .
it' s revolting .
i know .
you know it' s revolting yet you have no qualms enlisting me to endorse it ?
it' s diet ; it' s supposed to be awful .
i mean , what is the problem ?
the problem is that for no reason beyond my affection for you
i find myself peddling pond scum to an unsuspecting public .
hey , listen , you know the stakes are very high for me here .
you can' t just quit because ...
yes , i can .
and so can you .
when one finds oneself participating in an endeavor entirely without merit , one withdraws .
no .
no .
because sometimes you have to do things that you don' t like .
sometimes you have to suck it up and finish what you started .
it' s part of life .
you sound like my uncle .
look , leopold , jansen foods is a very important account for my company .
if you don' t go back in there then i get into a lot of trouble .
is this what you do at work , kate ?
research methods to deceive people ?
refine lies until they resemble truth ?
it' s no wonder you dread your work week .
oh !
man , i don' t have time for this .
what has happened to the world ?
you have every convenience , every comfort yet no time for integrity .
no .
what i don' t have time for are pious speeches by 200 year old men who' ve never had to work a day in their life .
you have no idea what i' ve done with my life .
and you you have no idea what i' ve done with mine !
i haven' t had all that many comforts and conveniences
leopold , because i' ve been paying dues all of my life and i' m tired , and i need a rest and if i have to peddle a little pond scum to get one then so be it .
very well .
we' re kidding ourselves , leopold .
in point of fact
i don' t even really know who you are .
you still don' t believe i' m the man i say i am ?
we had a great weekend ; that' s that .
and now it' s sunday .
it' s over .
# there' s such a lot of world to see ... #
i know .
i know , i know , it sounds crazy talking about ... finding a crack in time under the east river .
but in , in point , in point fact , gretchen you know ... it is no more crazy than , uh , a dog finding a rainbow .
dogs are color blind , gretchen .
they don' t see color .
really ?
just like we can' t see time .
we can feel it .
oh ... we can feel it passing but , uh , we can' t see it ; it' s just a blur .
it' s like , uh ... it' s like we' re riding in a , in a supersonic train and the world is just blowing by .
but imagine if we could stop that train , gretchen .
hmm ?
lmagine if we could stop that train get out , look around and see time for what it really is .
a universe , a world a thing as unimaginable as color to a dog .
and as real and tangible as that chair you' re sitting in .
now , if we could see it like that
i mean , really look at it then ... maybe we could see the flaws as well as the form .
and that' s it .
it' s that simple .
that' s all i discovered .
i' m just a ... just a guy who saw a crack in a chair that no one else could see .
i' m that dog who saw a rainbow .
only , uh ... none of the other dogs believe me .
i believe you .

i am a people pleaser , people !
whoo !
thank you so much .
i am so ...
kate !
stuart !
charlie !

maybe we weren' t such a waste of time after all .

leopold .
you got to go back , kate .
you got to go back there .

whoa , whoa !
whoa .
you okay ?
yeah .
i' m sorry .
thank you .
quite an entrance , huh ?
thank you , j. j.
thank you very much .
thank you .
thank you .
wow .
well , it' s a great night .
we here at crg have always considered ourselves to be in the " find what people want " business and at jansen , you guys are in the " make what people want " business .
so , imagine what we can do together .
we' il be able to find out exactly what people want and make it ... for them .
so ... yeah , so our customers ... will be able to get exactly ...
uh ... ... what they ... ... they want .
and , uh ... ... it' s a great thing to ... to get what you want .
uh , it' s a really good thing .
unless what you thought you wanted wasn' t really what you wanted because what you really ... ... wanted you couldn' t imagine , or you didn' t think it was possible .
but ... but what if someone came along who knew exactly what you wanted without asking ?
they just knew .
like they could ... hear your heart beating or listen to your thoughts .
and what if they were sure of themselves and they didn' t have to take a poll and they loved you ... and you hesitated ?
uh ...
and ...
i have to go .
i , uh ...
i' m sorry , but i have to go .
kate ?
stuart , can you tell me in short , complete sentences featuring no words over two syilables why exactly i am in these pictures ?
probably not .
try .
because you were there .
i wasn' t .
i would remember .
believe me , i would remember
if i was there .
because you' re going to be there .
if we get there in time .
these are pictures of the past , not the future .
not exactly .
theoretically speaking if you go to the past in the future then your future lies in the past .
and that is a picture of you in the future in the past .
we have to make a run for it .
let' s go .
come on , come on .
let' s go , let' s go .
come on !
whoa , where the hell do you think you' re going ? $6 . 80 on the meter , pal .
it' s going to close , kate !
come on !
ladies and gentlemen , may i have your attention ?
the duke of albany will be making a very important announcement in 20 minutes from this very stage .
and i believe it shall be an announcement that will justify the playing of a bridal waltz .
okay ... this is the hard part .
what ?
the girder .
the girder ?
you have to cross the girder , kate .
that girder ?
stuart , i can' t cross that girder .
i can' t go across ...
you love him , right ?
what ?
leopold .
you love him , right ?
yeah .
that' s all you need to know .
now go .
you' il be fine .
katie ...

# if i caught the world in a bottle #
# and everything was still beneath the moon #
# without your love , would it shine for me ? #
# if i was smart as aristotle #
# and understood the rings around the moon #
# what would it all matter if you loved me ? #
# here in your arms where the world is impossibly still #
# with a million dreams to fulfill #
# and a matter of moments until the dancing ends #
# here in your arms when everything seems to be clear #
# not a solitary thing would i fear #
# except when this moment comes near the dancing' s end #
# if i caught the world in an hourglass #
# saddled up the moon so we could ride #
# until the stars grew dim #
# until ... #
# one day you' il meet a stranger #
# and all the noise is silenced in the room #
# you' il feel that you' re close to some mystery #
# in the moonlight and everything shatters #
# you feel as if you' ve known her all your life #
# the world' s oldest lesson in history #
# here in your arms where the world is impossibly still #
# with a million dreams to fulfill #
# and a matter of moments until the dancing ends #
# here in your arms when everything seems to be clear #
# not a solitary thing do i fear #
# except when this moment comes near the dancing' s end #
# oh , if i caught the world in an hourglass #
# saddled up the moon and we would ride #
# until the stars grew dim #
# until the time that time stands still #
# until ... #
