so did they knock it down ?
i' m not getting through to people .

when they told me i' d been chosen the medicai center' s man of the year ... ... i assumed it had something to do with ... ... the miilions we have contributed to the new pediatric wing .
but as it turns out , i had my appendix removed earlier this year ... ... and under anesthesia , i apparently proposed marriage ... ... to every nurse in the hospital .
including the many attractive male nurses .
why are pediatrics so important to wade ?
i think feet are very important , aren' t they ?
i' m just teasing .
i know there' s more to pediatrics than feet .
thank you very much .
thank you .
always nice to see you .
george , congratulations .
hey , terry , how are you ?
stiii slicing people up ?
indeed .
yeah , i bet you are .

melanie corman .
hospitai administration .
my friend elaine cominsky wants to meet you , but she' s shy .
is that okay ?
that' s fine .
i' ve been too nervous to meet elaine myself .
good .
don' t move .
great tie , by the way .
thanks .
i was rather nervous about it .
hey .
hey .
hey , your brother wants to see you .
what ?
now ?
tonight ?
yeah , that' s what he said .
although sometimes it' s hard to teii with the accent .
this is elaine .
oh , heilo .
hi .
would you sign my go ?
oh , go !
i see what you mean .
sorry , i thought it was a medicai term .
you had me aii excited .
" to elaine , george wade .
thank you .
hang on just one second .
there' s no way i' m running up to westchester just because he cails .
it' s absurd .
he' ii just have to wait .
right on .
hey , man , forget him .
yeah .
should i get the car ?
yes , get the car .
good evening , mr. george .
good evening , rosario .
exceilent new hairdo .
mr. george .
no , i' m serious .
you iook iike a young imelda marcos .
heilo , george .
heilo , helen .
don' t you think rosario iooks particularly iovely tonight ?
i hadn' t reaily noticed .
rosario , the children need baths , please .
yes , miss helen .
so how are the kids , apart from dirty ?
they' re fine .
can i get you anything ?
i' d love some milk duds .
we don' t have any .
i could send out for one .
oh , no , don' t be ridiculous .
if you' re going to send out , get a whole box .
howard is in the gym .
right .
forty five minutes , 6 . 5 miles an hour , at an elevation of three .
it' s incredible how much more relaxed i feel .
helen does an hour a day too .
yes , you both seem extremely relaxed .
you can cut the relaxation with a knife .
so why am i here , howie ?
we iost the west side waterfront deai because your chief counsel ... ... your iatest model/ attorney ... ... forgot to file an environmentai impact report .
i wiii admit that the iaw is not amber' s strong point .
that' s why i fired her .
no , i fired her .
just as i fired debbie from st. barts ' law school ... ... and stacy from online law school .
i want someone from yale or columbia or from the continentai united states .
women of that ievei of inteilectuai ability often find me shailow .
then hire a man .
don' t be absurd .
because they wouldn' t sleep with you ?
no , because it would make you and dad too happy .
dad has been dead for 1 0 years .
weil , there is no reason for him to start enjoying himself now .
you need someone who can write a brief instead of removing yours .
and she can handle your divorce while she' s at it .
you are stiii getting divorced ?
unless my ex wife decides to faii in love with me again , or for the first time , yeah .
no !
why do you always find that so funny ?
it' s very hard to say .
hire a reai attorney by tomorrow .
don' t !
heilo , have a good day .
thank you , ma' am .
so you' re russian , you say ?
1 00 .
hence , blond hair , blue eyes , cheekbones .
sorry to have kept you so iong , but at ieast i feei i know everything about you .
and i you .
you know , usuaily i' m so nervous at interviews , but that was fun .
yes .
isn' t " fun " fun ?
it' s been a pleasure , tiffany .
mr. wade ?
mr. wade ?
hi , i' m lucy kelson .
i' m an attorney .
have you ever heard of saint tropez law school ?
no .
shame .
where did you go to iaw school ?
harvard .
harvard ?
yes .
intriguing .
teii me more .
what' s your background ?
i don' t see how that' s relevant .
i work for the coalition for the homeless .
i' m working at legai aid .
that can' t pay much .
weil , i' m not very interested in money .
now , mr. wade ....
wait a minute .
you' re kelson .
you iie in front of our wrecking bails .
you attacked the zegman brothers  i did not .
it' s not my fault they walked under a protest sign .
you' re not here for a job ?
i' m here representing ... ... the coney island community center .
it was built in 1 922 .
it' s the heart of coney island .
it has adult education , basketbail ... ... cpr , lamaze , water bailet , senior' s tae kwon do .
it' s great .
for children , it' s a home away from home .
i mean , i practicaily grew up there .
it' s iovely , but trump has the inside track .
nice to meet you .
no , mr. wade , you don' t understand .
i iive there , as weii as my parents .
they know assemblyman perez , who' s on the board .
if you can guarantee the preservation of this center , i can guarantee you the build .
but why us ?
why wade ?
weil , i can' t get in to see trump and the zegmans have a restraining order .
mr. w ?
you' re supposed to be taping the view in half an hour ... ... and public policy magazine needs a quote on the chailenges of urban planning .
hey .
right .
yes .
quote , quote , quote , quote ....
what i love about architecture is its ability to shape a community .
this center has shaped the community !
it turns strangers into neighbors
its ability to change strangers into neighbors .
how the right design for a park makes people feei secure .
how a schooi building can be functionai and beautifui so that kids feel ....
no , the community center makes children feei engaged , and it ailows them a place
functionai and beautifui so that kids feei engaged instead of imprisoned ?
yeah , it sounds good .
i iike that .
but i said a community center , not a school .
i know , it' s aii very good .
jump in .
thanks .
nice shirt .
thank you .
so do we have a deal ?
no .
i want something else from you .
no .
i am fuily aware of your reputation and there' s no way you' re getting that .
no .
getting what ?
you know .
the sex .
that' s not gonna happen .
no , that would be nice .
i promise to save your community center .
on top of which , you can direct our pro bono efforts .
that' s miilions at your charitable disposal .
i' ve spent my entire iife working against people iike you .
weil , maybe if you work for me , you' ii win occasionaily .
i need an answer , i' m afraid , immediately .
here is my direct number at the grand hotel .
you iive at a hotel ?
weil , i own the hotei and i iive there .
my iife is very much iike monopoly .
and i know you wouldn' t care , but i' ii start you at $250, 000 .
there' s also usuaily a very nice christmas bonus .
thank you .
i can' t believe how much i ate .
i' m proud of you .
the whole ieft side of the menu .
you know when i get tense , i just start to eat .
honey , you cannot work for that man .
hey , we can use the baii money .
remember what sun tzu said ?
yes .
keep your friends close and your enemies closer .
sun tzu didn' t have a daughter .
what' s this ?
oh , dessert .
thank you .
it' s the only way to save the community center .
it is .
and if i work for him ... ... i have huge resources at my disposai for charities and shelters ....
yes , but  mom , i promise .
i wiii stiii be your daughter .
i wiii stiii be a iawyer .
and i wiii stiii have aii the same ideals .
let' s update aii the files .
especiaily the muni codes because i' ii need those .
i' m gonna speak with mr. wade .
mr. wade , so sorry to bother .
i' ve been over the environmentai impact reports for island towers .
i would reaily love to talk to you .
very good .
which one of these do you prefer ?
how do you mean ?
it' s for my new personalized stationery .
is this a trick question ?
they iook exactly the same to me .
no , not at ail .
this is a iinen finish and this is a watermarked veilum finish .
leaving aside the fact that they' ve taken perfectly good forests ... ... and denuded them in order to produce this nonrecyclable paper ... ... i would say it was ....
weil , then this one .
it tastes better .
do you know , i' ve asked 30 people that question .
you' re the only one to come up with that answer .
my god , you' re good .
i' m getting you a bigger office .
no , it' s very sweet , but i' d rather go over the
very firm .
but is it too firm ?
there' s some debate among chiropractors about the optimum ievei of mattress tension .
what are your thoughts ?
if you reaily want to know , the more firm the mattress ... ... the more pressure on the 5th vertebra .
quite bouncy , though .
have a bounce .
no .
heilo .
yes , i' m glad you' re up .
i didn' t want to wake you .
i just felt iike a chat .
george , it is 2 : 1 5 in the morning .
can' t you talk to whatever mensa candidate you' re with ?
i resent the implication ... ... that because someone may not share your high iq ... ... they' re not a person of substance and depth .
you aii right ?
i swailowed my altoid .
she swailowed her altoid .
that can happen .
a sudden hair flick , very dangerous .
okay , george , i am tired .
put her on the phone .
you mean , put her on the phone ?
put her on the phone !
aii right .
someone for you .
hi .
hi .
the man you' re dancing with is deeply troubled , okay ?
and even though he' s rich and attractive ... ... you' re too young to trade yourself iike a stock on nasdaq ... ... for someone who won' t remember your name ... ... or his in the morning , is stiii married ... ... and has recently had a very suspicious rash .
it is 2 : 1 6 .
go home , finish high schooi and reach your potential !
you aii right ?
i think i' m gonna go .
what did you say to her ?
nice chat ?
yes .
that we have to talk about .
now , do you think i should cry ?
i was thinking bursts of sobs .
more of a whimper .
you' re pathetic .
good night .
aii right .
i' m sure he' ii be here any minute .
is there any more diet coke ?
sorry , everybody .
did i miss the blessed event ?
check with me before you talk .
now that we' re aii here , i' d iike to discuss the settlement terms .
the terms have been set .
it' s cailed a prenup .
we both know ... ... that a prenup doesn' t preclude certain recompensatory
in plain english , although i can foilow you in german and japanese if you prefer .
she wants double the alimony .
no way .
given the situation , it' s not an unreasonable request .
you' re referring to the aileged infidelity , are you not ?
aileged ?
he was having sex with her in our bed .
i knew you were worried about getting anything on that sofa .
how dare you come in here  i shouldn' t have said that .
sorry .
please .
so you are saying that infidelity is worth twice the alimony .
using your reasoning , any infidelity on her part ... ... would have to be held against her in a monetary accounting .
what are you suggesting ?
the soon to be ex mrs. wade did a iittle couch time with a company accountant .
and he' s wiiling to testify .
i have ioyai employees .
i think it' s the health plan .
the health plan is exceilent .
thank you .
we wiii not agree to pay any  we wiii pay the alimony ... ... plus $ 1 00, 000 and a generous property settlement ... ... if you release me from further obligation .
you son of a bitch !
what ?
watch your ianguage or you wiii not get the estate , mrs. wade .
don' t caii me that !
you' re just another one of his stupid bimbos !
now , wait !
she is far from stupid
what do you think you' re doing ?
went up my nose .
water went up my nose .
it' s only water .
okay , this hankie is very nearly clean .
i' m going to dab you .
you may blow .
thank you .
good .
divorce always gives me an appetite .
kebab ?
no , i' ve never warmed to the idea of a flesh popsicle .
one , please .
chicken , thank you .
why did you give her the money ?
she' d never have stopped tiii she got what she wanted .
you always say i have a responsibility towards those iess fortunate .
everybody is iess fortunate than you ... ... so just give the money to someone who' s not gonna spend it on coilagen .
you only want me to be generous to those you approve of .
no .
i only want you to finaily ailow me to do my job .
you did your job .
this morning i was married , now i' m not .
you did it superbly .
thank you very much .
here , that' s fine .
you keep the change .
thank you .
george .
hey , that' s my coffee , you jerk !
oh , sir , i' m so sorry .
moron !
i thought you were needy .
what' s wrong with you ? !
can' t a guy have a cup of coffee ? !
it' s aii right .
come on , mother teresa .
my only cup of the day !
you ruined it !
okay , now , what do you think ?
too ornate ?
i don' t care about the belt .
you' re upset .
look , from now on , i' ii get someone else to handle my divorces .
it' s not iike i enjoy them .
maybe i should go somewhere where no one knows how much money i have .
where is staten island ?
why don' t we go there ?
thanks , but harvard doesn' t give a degree in yenta .
i' m not here to find you a wife or to pick out your clothes .
my heroes are clarence darrow , thurgood marshail ....
who' s another non scummy iawyer ?
my parents !
my father worked for martin luther king .
my mother is a iaw professor .
they taught me that iawyers should be treated with respect .
i have complete respect for you .
r e s p e c t.
luce , wait .
wait !
dearly beloved , we are gathered here to join together meryi and tom ... ... as they stand before us on this joyous day ... ... proclaim their love and enter into that most sacred bond of ail ... ... the bond of holy
is that yours ?
i' m so sorry .
please continue .
everyone iooks so beautiful .
just keep going .
bye .
you guys , i' ii be right back .
hold this for me .
i' ii be back .

keep your dinner .
i' ii keep my 20 and we' ii caii it even .
okay , sounds good .
okay , bye .

miss kelson .
ms. hana .

it' s on television .
what do you think ?
please don' t teii me you cailed me out of a wedding to help you pick out a suit .
you ran out of a wedding ?
that' s horrible !
you said it was an emergency !
didn' t i memo you as to what constitutes an emergency ?
yes .
large meteor , severe ioss of blood and what' s the third one again ?
death !
and you' re not dead .
no .
you weren' t dead when you cailed me at 3 : 00 a . m ... ... because you had a nightmare about becoming a member of klss .
just iike when you barged in on my woman' s doctor appointment ... ... to ask me which picture to put on the cover of people .
i don' t iike those very much .
if it' s any consolation , i wiii be dead eventuaily .
tonight is important .
i' m representing the wade organization .
that includes you .
not anymore , george .
i' m sorry ?
you got island towers , i got coney island .
why don' t we just caii it quits , okay ?
i can' t take it anymore .
what , are you serious ?
yes .
please , consider this my two weeks ' notice .
i find you ungrateful .
ungrateful ?
yes , ungrateful .
ungrateful ? !
yes .
i hire you with no corporate experience .
i give you an apartment , a great office , the nonfat muffin basket every morning .
george !
why do you keep your phone on ?
you crave the excitement .
this is entirely my thing ... ... because i' ve managed to turn myself into this ....
it' s not iike i' m enjoying it either .
now i can' t .
i' m addicted .
i have to know what you think .
what do you think ?
i think you are the most selfish human being on the planet .
that' s just siily .
have you met everyone on the planet ?
goodbye , george .
i don' t have a shirt .
ansel , i finaily quit .
he cailed me out of meryl' s wedding .
i' ii never get that moment back .
okay .
i' ii set up interviews with iaw firms that do pro bono work , and
all right , hang on .

lucy , your rsum is amazing .
you know that .
but we do a iot of business with wade .
aii the more reason for me to make a smooth transition .
lucy .
yes .
george wade cailed me this morning and informed me ... ... that you are indispensable to his organization .
at the moment , we' re not hiring .
then why did you agree to see me ?
honestly , we' re partners with zodiac construction
they do miilions of doilars of business with wade realty
and mr. wade  doesn' t want you to hire me .
the attorney who was planning to quit reconsidered .
when did mr. wade cail ?
mr. wade never cailed .
when ? !
maybe an hour ago .
make sure you massage his cloven hoof !
i' m suddenly feeling a pain in my ass .
i am unemployable !
you cailed everyone except for slurpee heaven !
that is not true .
i did caii slurpee heaven .
they didn' t want you .
heard you had attitude .
said you weren' t slurpee material .
you should reaily iet us work on you .
i don' t iike to be touched !
i' m sorry , you guys are great .
it' s not you .
aii right , iisten .
you have a contract and it says you wiii work untii island towers is finalized .
which is completion of construction , or i can stop you working elsewhere .
and there' s no ioopholes because you drafted it and you' re the best .
subconsciously , i think you drafted it that way because you don' t reaily want to go .
does it kiii you how weii i know you ?
honey , this contract is exceilent work .
i' m very proud of you .
dad , i' m trying to get out of it .
i don' t know why you went to work for that philandering robber baron .
you usually have impeccable instincts .
look at your boyfriend , ansel .
he' s a dedicated environmental warrior .
this is ironclad .
houdini couldn' t get out of this contract .
you should' ve stayed at the iegai aid job .
if i do pro bono work with a company with these resources ...
... i can accomplish so much  come on over for strawberry ice cream .
have tofutti !
you heard what the doctor said .
your cholesteroi is over 300 !
you' re basicaily a solid .
two of the greatest iegai minds in this country arguing over dessert .
lucy , it was your choice to work for that man .
you could' ve done anything .
you could' ve clerked for the supreme court .
i don' t know what to teii you .
short of going in and deliberately trying to get fired .
you stay away from that freezer !
good morning , boys .
sorry , i am so iate .
that' s fine .

i' d iike to stir up some publicity if we could .
yes , very nice .
i' m
i' m working on endorsements from iocai merchants .
we were working on some ideas there .
i thought that was terrific .
pathetic .
what' s pathetic ?
you .
i know what you' re doing .
i am not doing anything .
you think if you come in iate and spit on the boss that wiii get you fired ?
not in this company .
chris .
george .
george , i have an ulcer .
i don' t sleep weil , mostly because you keep cailing me at night .
if you don' t caii me , i dream you' re gonna caii me .
i think about you in the shower , not in a good way ... ... but in an i' m so distracted i can' t remember if i washed my hair way .
so i wash my hair twice .
so i have a hole in my stomach , i am running out of shampoo ... ... and today is the first time in my iife i did not give a 1 000 percent on the job ... ... and i hate that feeling !
i won' t caii after hours .
you wiil , george !
you know you wiil .
yeah , i wiil .
i just don' t think we can see each other professionaily anymore .
aii right .
stay untii you find a replacement .
train him up for a couple of weeks , then you can go to slurpee heaven .
thank you !
i promise i wiii find you somebody amazing .
somebody better than me because i' m not even any good .
no .
a glorified ambulance chaser .
thank you .
i got it .
it' s just my earring .
my hair !
careful !
that' s my overpriced italian belt .
just get it off !
howard .
join us .
we were just brainstorming .
lucy ?
yes .
i was thinking it might be a good idea to do a photo op at the build site ... ... where george would be in the ....
george in the foreground , pointing up to the sky ...
... iike this .
yes .
then i thought i could take my belt off , as if to say , iet' s get to work !
right .
right o .
on behalf of wade corporation , i' d iike to thank the community board ... ... for giving us the opportunity to work with you on this project .
and we iook forward to seeing aii of you at the groundbreaking .
i did weii with those eight people .
i thought you were fantastic .

it won' t be charming ... ... once you block out the sun with this condo hotei monstrosity !
we wiii have a sun deck .
that' s something , isn' t it ?
larry , ruth , i can' t teii you how much i appreciate your support on this project .
at ieast you' re keeping the community center .
unless you' re wiiling to reconsider the entire project .
i' m afraid that won' t happen .
it is over 50 miilion in profits .
i think it' s immorai that any human being should acquire that much wealth .
i don' t know how you sleep at night .
a machine that plays the ocean .
i used to come up here aii the time when i was a kid .
my speciai place .
i had a smaii one bedroom on park and 91 st .
that' s so very oliver twist .
times were hard .
but you know what ?
we were happy .
didn' t have a view as good as this .
it' s great , isn' t it ?
i used to take up some ice cream and my carole king tape ... ... and iook at the neighborhood .
it' s amazing what you could see .
at night , the whole building went downstairs .
the fathers stood on one corner .
the mothers stood on the other .
kids would just ride their bicycles around .
as you can see , not much has changed .
mr. and mrs. goldfarb would be sitting in the middle of the street ... ... saving a parking space for their children who were coming next weekend .
and you up here on your own .
it' s hard to find a quiet place in brooklyn to think .
or to replay whatever argument i just had with my mother .
yes .
yeah , she' s terrifying .
i thought she was gonna kiii me and feed me to the poor .
yeah , she' s a piece of work .
but for better or worse , she' s the voice in my head pushing me to do better .
chailenge the accepted wisdom .
never settle for a b instead of an a on a test .
you once got a b ?
hypotheticaily speaking .
right .
of course , no matter how hard i try , i wiii never iive up to her expectations .
weil , there are worse things in iife .
like no one having any expectations .
there' s something amuck with this sponge cake .
tofu .
you' re not concentrating .
this offends me .
yeah , i' m sorry , ton .
i iost lucy .
i just think it' s a shame because i' ve come to rely on her for everything .
and i trust her completely , and she' s funny .
not deliberately , of course .
hey , you know , it' s probably for the best though .
oh , yeah ?
why is that ?
two things i know is chess and women .
chess , it has rules , pieces , rooks , knights , bishops .
they move in predictable patterns .
somebody wins , somebody ioses .
but women , they don' t have no rules , man .
they move in unpredictable ways too .
nobody ever wins or ioses when it comes to women .
you talk about your feelings untii your breath is sucked out your body .
aii men are pawns when it comes to women .
especiaily a smart one iike lucy .
she' s hard to control .
and you know , the man has got to be in control .
like with me .
i come home .
when i walk in , i know my mama has dinner on the table .
aii right , so you' re stiii iiving at home ?
yeah .
yeah .
of course .
here' s somebody interesting , poily st. clair .
weil , it' s a terrific rsum , poily .
congratulations on the baby .
what baby ?
maybe you should check with me before you talk .
what baby ?
i' d iike to talk about your moot court experience .
what baby ?
yeah , what baby ?
you should do the interviews on your own .
harry raskin , richard beck .
interesting prospects for my replacement .
let' s see .
no , it' s gotta be a woman .
what a surprise .
i suppose a certain bust size would help .
maybe some bathing suit shots ?
it wiii annoy howard if it' s a woman .
thank you .
teii you what .
aii i want is someone as inteiligent as you ... ... but a iittle iess tense and argumentative .
a sort of katharine hepburn figure .
you don' t deserve katharine hepburn .
audrey hepburn .
also too good .
just stay away from the hepburns .
you forgot a beet .
beet .
thank you .
i' ve got that charity tennis thing tonight .
and i need to know , does this shirt make me iook a bit kind of bjrn borg ?
ansei and i got into a huge fight , and i think we just broke up .
reaily ?
he wants me to go on a greenpeace boat .
he thinks i can' t embrace iife .
is that the case ?
because i just don' t see it .
i just don' t see it .
and by the way , how can i embrace him when he is never here ?
maybe it' s me .
maybe the rose colored glasses have finaily come off .
okay .
we obviously can' t ieave you alone with the stapler .
i' ii teii you what .
i' ii cancei tennis .
they always make me play with ed koch .
what can we do to cheer you up ?
nothing .
there' s no solution .
good .
good attitude .
i can' t help it if i don' t iike boats .
surely not aii boats .
yes , aii boats .
i don' t understand .
what is wrong with me ?
at the moment , huge quantities of alcohol .
i don' t know .
i just seem to drive men away .
there' s ansel .
there' s biily from legai aid who ran off with a stripper .
don' t forget gary from the peace corps who married his trainer .
gary , yes .
what is wrong with me ?
i want to know .
you' re sort of a man .
aii right ?
i' m good .
so teii me .
what' s the matter with me ?
weil , you can be somewhat intimidating .
you could ioosen up a iittle , get in touch with your feminine side .
okay , that' s a good suggestion .
perhaps soften your appearance .
not that i don' t love that iook , but you could get doiled up occasionaily .
i' m not going to spend hours fluffing my hair and applying ... ... animal tested makeup to my face ... ... just so i can turn myself into some male fantasy , degrading kewpie doil .
unless i , you know , reaily iike the guy or something .
you see , maybe that' s the problem .
you don' t iike these guys .
you drive them away because you realize , deep down , they' re wrong for you .
they' re not wrong for me .
we have aii the same politicai goals and ideals , aii of them .
which i guess isn' t very romantic , but what can i say ?
i' m fine .
what can i say ?
i' m just not a romantic person .
never felt that way about anybody .
nope .
no .
no , in high school , rick beck took me parking .
you know , parking ?
and the whole time i talked about nelson mandela .
don' t know why i did that .
that is hard to say .
i certainly would have found it extremely erotic .
come back .
i' m fine .
i don' t know .
maybe i' m just not good in bed .
maybe you' re not .
i am .
yeah ?
yeah .
i am reaily good in bed .
you might be iousy .
no , believe me , pal .
you should be so iucky because the iawyerly exterior ... ... don' t iet that fooi you because inside i am , iike , a complete animal .
it' s , iike , bobcat .
you know , it' s scary .
i can see that it might be .
no .
no .
look , i can bend iike a pretzel .
i' m serious .
and i' m not talking the straight kind .
i' m talking , iike , the twisty kind .
twisty iike the bobcat , salty type of pretzel .
because that' s what men want , right ?
that is their dream .
the twisty bobcat kind of pretzel ... ... because that' s what you want , and i bet i could give you a twisty bobcat pretzel .
do you want it ?
you' re a reaily good iistener .
luce ?
luce ?
are you ... ?
heilo ?
cormac !
help !
help !
i' ii just get her upstairs .
think you can make it ?
no .
no , iet' s put her somewhere else .
good .
good .
like a doil .
a doii with a sinus problem .
we should put a piilow under her head .
i think that helps .
good .
much worse .
interesting .
do you think we should change her clothes ?
right .
don' t know where that came from .
morning !
okay , not so ioud .
we didn' t ....
last we didn' t ....
it was a magicai night .
you made sounds i' ve never heard a woman make before .
we didn' t ....
not physicaily , but spirituaily , you were the best i' ve ever had .
whatever i did or didn' t do or said or didn' t say ... ... it was aii a iittle mistake .
weil , nothing happened .
that' s a relief .
i' m very busy .
i have work to do .
you stay there and relax .
okay , i' ii see you iater .
lucy !
jesus , careful .
there' s a june carver to see you .
june carver , june carver , june carver .

weil , you know , not that much , reaily .
i just
and there' s this .
i' ve never met mr. wade ... ... but in public policy magazine he was interviewed ... ... about the chailenges of urban development and he said that
is it ridiculous that i' m quoting this ?
no , not yet .
architecture can shape a community and turn strangers into neighbors .
the right design for a park makes people feei secure .
a schooi building can be functionai and beautiful ... ... so kids feei engaged instead of imprisoned .
when i read that , it made me feei i' d be working for a cause ... ... not just a company .
okay .
you' re hired .
you' re mr. wade .
someone has to be .
although , i didn' t write that .
lucy did .
no , you did .
i remember being shocked .
we' ve been working together so iong it' s hard to remember who did what .
sounds iike an amazing team .
george , do you mind ?
i was saying how incredibly presumptuous it was of me to come waltzing in here ... ... but miss kelson was nice enough to see me .
they' re cailing from the zoning commission , lucy .
june , why don' t we set up a proper interview for tomorrow .
it' s aii right .
it' s aii right .
i could finish up with june .
you' re not coming to the meeting ?
have i ever come to the meeting ?
good point .
alrighty .
alrighty .

the ficus is fired .
bye bye .
bye .

i was just wondering , are we stiii on for the mets game tonight ?
i love basebail .
so are we stiii good ?
i' m a red sox fan , aii the way .
a red sox fan ?
interesting .
you obviously have a rich fantasy iife which is a fabulous plus in this company .
okay , that means you' re a boston girl , probably a iittle bit irish , catholic ...

yeah , she smiled obsequiously , flattered me constantly .
she' d have no problem picking out an ottoman .
exactly what i' m iooking for .
a tad weak on the experience side , but
we went out for a drink , talked for an hour .
she' s a very clever girl , you know .
sharp .
so you guys went out for a drink and ....
she got nowhere to stay at the moment , so i found her a room at the grand .
and i invited her to the company outing .
turns out she' s a usefui tennis player .
weil , i can swing a racket .
yes , i know , at my head .
i' ve experienced it .

thomas , ginsburg , scalia , stevens ... ... kennedy , rehnquist , souter , breyer , o' connor .

how should i know ?
want some ?
thanks , i reaily shouldn' t .
okay .
you think she' s a naturai redhead ?
you know , i was gonna give june a iift , and then howard offered .
the fact that he iiked her is a big strike against her .

i thought you iiked her too .
no , i jus i think i just ate too much .

it' s not perfect timing , i must say .
we' ii be in the city in 20 minutes .
i don' t have 20 seconds !
i feei iike i swailowed a cruise missile .
what ?
what am i ?
5 years old ?
it' s only a volvo .
weil , people just don' t go in volvos !
i' ii buy you another volvo .
no !
that' ii be the only thing you' ii ever remember about me .
i' ii be the woman who went on the front seat !
that would be hard to forget .
okay , i have an idea .
see that rv ?
yes .
that is our target .
can you make it ?
therein iies your salvation .
no .
yes , it' s an exceilent idea .
it' s unclean !

i can hold it !
george , i can hold it !
i' m holding it !
i' m fine , i can hold it !

i' m sure it' s been safely towed by now .
oh , god !
george , george , george !
don' t worry , don' t worry !
in many ways , it was the perfect end to the day .
except for those poor children in the trailer .
they actuaily iooked quite frightened .
don' t worry , i won' t teii anyone .
once it' s published in the company newsletter , there' d be absolutely no point .
aii right , i' ii caii for a iift .
would you iike to have your nails done ?
a hoilywood tan , perhaps ?
god , it is such a beautifui city .
and my favorite building of aii time .
look at that .
nirosta steel , sunburst tower , gleaming gargoyles ... ... aii designed by a man cailed wiiliam van alen ... ... obsessed with beating his former partner ... ... who was building the bank of manhattan tower at 927 feet .
so van alen announced the chrysler building at 925 feet ... ... and then surreptitiously assembled the 1 80 foot mast inside the tower ... ... and only revealed it after the bank tower had been completed ... ... giving van alen the tailest building for three months ...
... untii of course  untii the empire state building .
aii right , please give me the name of van alen' s former partner .
who is h. craig severance ?
i find you annoying .
yes , i' m sure you do .
but it is pretty amazing what dreams and iots of money can do , isn' t it ?
yes , it is .
and you know you' re part of that , george .
yes , i am .
aii you have to do is use your power for good instead of evil .
if only i would .
listen ... ... i' m very sorry that these iast couple of months have been unbearable for you .
not at ail .
unbearable would have been bearable .
then i suppose it' s a good thing that your two weeks are almost up .
this is it .
i' ii do the children' s league benefit .
i' ii make sure june is set up .
i' ii take a pass at your speech for the groundbreaking ... ... and i' ii be out of your iife forever .

i stiii feei terrible about that .
thank god she iooks okay .
especiaily with that big benefit you' re aii going to tonight .
what was it again ?
it' s a benefit ... ... for the new york children' s league .
lucy makes us give iots of money ... ... to help society and get a tax break .
briiliant .
sounds exciting .
it would be almost impossible ... ... to teii you how boring it is .
largely because it would be too boring .
weil , boring to you might be scintiilating for a giri from plainview , wisconsin .
see you iater .
what about , if you' re not busy ... ... a bunch of us are going , do you want to come and be bored ?
i' d love to .
aii right .
see you iater .
okay .
oh , good .
these need to go to accounting .
the ioan agreements need to be notarized .
i got it .
here' s the zoning commission reports .
now you can start with the appraisals
actuaily , i don' t know how much time i have .
george sort of asked me to go to the benefit with him tonight .
great .
i just have to figure out what to wear .
i don' t have anything .
" i don' t have anything .
god , she' s nice .
no , they' re very good muffins .
they just need more fat .
george , sign these or we default on five different ioans .
take care .
weil , hang on .
hang on .
i need to go over my speech .
sorry .
i gotta run .
we' ii pick you up at eight and go through it in the car .
i asked june to come .
hope that' s aii right .
oh , that' s dandy , but i don' t need a ride .
thanks .
heilo , howard .
george ... ... i just received new estimates on island towers .
costs are skyrocketing .
it will be cheaper to just knock down the community center .
what are you talking about ?
we only got the job because we said we' d keep it .
we said we intended to keep the center .
no wait .
you can' t
this is nonsense .
you can' t just decide unilateraily .
i' m coming over .
george .
i want to take a nap before the benefit .
it' s all very simple .
why can' t we just build the towers over the center ?
because it will eat away our profits .
there' s to be a groundbreaking ceremony at coney island ... ... with our friend assemblyman perez .
all i need is one of your charming speeches .
weil , you' re not gonna get one .
i need you there .
i have to consult my schedule .
no , you won' t , george .
it' s your job .
you' re the public face of the company .
they don' t want to see me .
i can' t for the iife of me think why not .
you' re magnificent .
look , whatever we iose on this deal , i' m in for half .
you' ii be in for nothing at the rate you' re going .
expensive divorces , poolside parties at the hotei for 1 000 people ... ... including fireworks and a performance by sting .
that was one speciai night .
it was wendy the concierge' s fareweii bash and a very good party if i say so myself .
look , i know you don' t have a clue , but the economy is not what it was .
everything we' ve got , aii of it , could go .
faster than you can imagine .
we need this built .
you' re our closer and you wiii help me close this deal ... ... or i wiii fire you and take aii your stock options .
and i can' t bear to see you iike that , george .
you wiii help me close this deal , george , won' t you ?
i' m surprised you have to ask .
i wasn' t reaily asking .
you should have gone with george .
weil , he asked june .
not exclusively .
he asked you too .
he asked me too ?
how many women should a man take to dinner ?
maybe in utah .
so you' re gonna go alone ?
sure , why not ?
hey , i think it' s great .
i was always too scared to go anywhere alone .
then i got married .
now i' ii never be alone again .
check out this situation .
you two kids have fun .
aii right .
howard .
helen , how are you ?
mr. and mrs. wade , good evening .
i hate these things .
ridiculous .
why can' t we just give the money and be done with it ?
yes , that' d be fun .
who wants a drink ?
i' d love some champagne .
we don' t want anything .
i' ii have a scotch .
great .
i' ii be right back with one of the promotionai bottles .
wade .
trump .
i hear kelson finaily dumped you .
not exactly , no .
we came to a mutuai understanding that she couldn' t bear me for another second .
so who' s the new chief counsel ?
if she' s any good , i' m gonna steai her away .
i doubt it .
she seems quite ioyai to me .
let me be the judge of that .
aii right .
i' m not intimidated .
i' ii even iead you to her .
she' s over there somewhere .
good evening .
good evening .
weil , you iook i
i you
i can' t wait to hear your speech .
yeah .

i' m sorry , was i interrupting something ?
no , no .
we were just ... ... going over my speech .
right .
work , work , work .
howard wants me to revise the island towers proposal ... ... now that we' re tearing down the community center .
i could reaily use your help with that .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
george , can i please talk to you for a second ?
hang on .
they' re about to shoot a man out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .
george .
i don' t care about howard .
no community center .
i see .
okay .
we do give miilions to charities .
so that justifies iying .
since when is helping people and teiling the truth mutuaily exclusive ?
you promised me .
oh , here we go .
you said you needed me to teii you when you were being a schmuck .
it' s frankly none of your business , is it ?
you don' t work here anymore !
i cannot believe you won' t even try to be the person you could be .
this is the person i could be .
no .
you think you' re second rate and there' s nothing you can do .
and i never believed it untii right now .
this minute .
this is the first time in a year that i reaily don' t iike you .
i haven' t iiked me for ionger than that .
and i' m not crazy about you right now .
why don' t you go and be the person you' re supposed to be .
oh , good .

for years , coney island has been trying to attract this kind of development .

we didn' t raise you to sit on the sidelines .

you were on the white house enemies iist at 5 .
dad , i' m not sitting on the sidelines .
i' m going to work .
what' s the point ?
the man' s not gonna iisten to me .
besides , you know , he said some things to me that were just so ....
true .
then you change your tactics , you change your argument .
you don' t give up .
we didn' t give up on civii rights or equality for women or fair housing .
honey .
as iong as people can change , the world can change .
yeah , but what if people can' t change ?
weil ... ... iet me put it this way .
i' m sitting here eating a piece of cheesecake made entirely of soy .
and i hate it .
but i' m eating it .
i' m going to work .
bye .
good iuck .
the iaw is pretty clear on this .
if the iandlord has not kept up proper maintenance , he cannot evict you .
we wiii help you , mrs. muez .
let me run and get you some forms that you can fiii out , and we' ii get started .
weil , heilo .
hi .
you don' t remember me , do you ?
poily st. clair ?
you interviewed me ?
you thought i was having a baby ?
oh , yes .
yes , poily .
wow .
so you work here now .
terrific .
how are you ?
pregnant .
i' m not failing for that one again .
no , i' m reaily pregnant .
you can congratulate me now .
poily , i was not born yesterday .
i' m pregnant !
you want to see the damn sonogram ?
mrs. muez , we have two other cases
hi .
hi .
i' m busy .
yes .
i need your advice on one iast thing ... ... and then i promise you wiii never hear from me again .
i just delivered the first speech written entirely by myself since we met ... ... and i think i may have blown it , so i wanted to ask your thoughts .
okay .
then i wiii read it to you .
i' d iike to welcome everyone on this speciai day .
island towers wiii bring prestige to the neighborhood ... ... and become part of brooklyn' s renaissance .
and we' re very pleased and proud to be here .
unfortunately , there is one fly in the ointment .
you see , i gave my word to someone ... ... that we wouldn' t knock down this building behind me .
normaily , and those who know me or were married to me can attest to this ... ... my word wouldn' t mean very much .
so why does it this time ?
weil , partly because this building is an architecturai gem ... ... and deserves to be iandmarked .
partly because people do need a place to do senior' s water bailet and cpr .
preferably not together .
but mainly because this person , despite being unusuaily stubborn ... ... and unwiiling to compromise and a very poor dresser , is ....
she' s ... ... rather iike the building she ioves so much .
a iittle rough around the edges , but when you iook closely ... ... absolutely beautiful .
and the only one of her kind .
and even though i' ve said cruei things and driven her away ... ... she' s become the voice in my head .
and i can' t seem to drown her out .
and i don' t want to drown her out .
so we are going to keep the community center .
because i gave my word to her ... ... and because we gave our word to the community .
and i didn' t sleep with june .
that' s not in the speech , that' s just me ietting you know that important fact .
what do you think ?
i have to get back to work .
right .
right , yes , yes , yes .
sorry to disturb .
congratulations again , poily .
aside from the split infinitive that was somewhere in the middle ... ... that speech was actuaily quite perfect , wasn' t it ?
yeah .
i don' t know what the heii you' re stiii doing sitting here .
and i don' t even iike him .
george !
george , i just want to say thank you .
thank you and i know i can be harsh and demanding ... ... but i want to try and change because i believe people can change .
i can change and not be so demanding and , you know , iike , meet you halfway .
i just i know things just
once i
lucy ... ... i am in love with you .
and i' m in love with you .
oh , i should just mention that i have resigned ...
... and am now poor .
good .
when i say poor , i mean we may have to share a helicopter with another family .
does that work for you ?
as iong as i don' t have to work for you , we wiii be fine .
exceilent .
