we' ve never followed through on a single thing , you know .
and i think that' s what makes us so special .

you hear me ?
you be quiet ! enough in there !
hi .
i' m violet sanford .
i just recently moved to new york , and i was wondering ifyou would give my tape to one of your artists .
violet , that is so cute .
now , let me tell you about me .
my name is wendy , and i first moved to new york ... when i was 21 to be a dancer , but i broke my big toe .
and then i got knocked up by this actor who dumped me to join the peace corps .
so for the last 16 years i been raisin ' my daughter all by myself .
and then two weeks ago she tells me that she is a bisexual ... and that she hates me more than any person on this planet .
now , tell me how i can help you , please , because i am dying to make your dreams come true .
you don' t take the tape unless it comes from an agent , but i can' t get an agent until i get published ?
if we were to listen to that tape , that would give you grounds ... for a copyright or plagiarism lawsuit .
it' s just a little tape .
all i want is someone to sing my songs .
welcome to the music business .
good evening .
i. d. , please .
hi .
uh , sure .
what can i get you ?
let me ask you something .
i' m a songwriter .
is there someone here i could talk to about my songs ?
i' ve been a struggling sax player for 12 years .
what can i get you from the bar ?
pepsi and some crackers .
hey .
how are you doing ?
excuse me .
who' s that guy ?
that would be mr. o' donnell .
mr. o' donnell .
he' s the manager or something ?
yeah .
he' s the music manager .
he' s in charge of finding bands and ... booking new talent .
hey , where the hell were you , o' donnell ?
i got 15 orders stacked up here and nobody to run the grill .
fifteen orders , walt .
is that all ?
gimme ten minutes , i' il catch us up .
go on .
lie down .
relax .
you look tired .
we can talk about my raise later .
you think this is australia ?
there' s no raise .
i' m about to fire you .
um , excuse me .
mr. o' donnell ?
yes .
mr. o' donnell .
my name is violet sanford .
i' m a songwriter .
i just wanted to give this to you .
i know it' s not the most professional way to submit a tape .
but this is all pretty new to me .
it' s pretty new to me too .
i just figured as the manager of a club like this , you must know every band on the east coast .
the manager ... of this club .
um
you guys go ahead .
i' il catch up .
sure thing .
mr. o' donnell .
i don' t usually do this , violet .
um , but i i have a feeling aboutyou .
so i' m gonna take your tape , and i' m gonna see what i can do .
thank you .
i can' t believe how easy this was .
neither can i.
uh , you wanna go for some coffee or something ?
o' donnell , who do i look like ?
your goddamn maid ?
that' s mr. o' donnell , but i' il let it slide this time .
i told you to take your stuff home and wash it .
you got cow grease caked on the front .
walt , i' ve warned you about your attitude you' re fired .
oh , you better not push me , kid .
i can find a hundred other little punks like you , can burn a turkey burger .
minimum wage punk .
maybe we should start over .
uh ...
i' m kevin o' donnell , and i work the grill here at the fiji mermaid club .
i just made a complete fool of myself .
i was gonna tell you .
i' m almost sure i would have told you .
i just want you to know i' m not following you home .
i' m just walking myself 26 blocks in the wrong direction .
i asked you to leave me alone .
did i mention how sorry i am ?
i mean , not that it' s all my fault .
you did throw yourself at me .
i didn' t throw myself at you .
i was pretending to be sweet and innocent so you' d give me a break .
can i ask you a question ?
what ?
is there a reason we just walked in a circle ?
are you lost ?
i' m not lost .
somebody just moved my street .
you you wanna play a game ?
i bet i can guess where you' re from .
i' m about to get out my pepper spray .
i reckon you' re from a big city .
and there' s no sign from here of a belly button ring ... or a tongue piercing .
i gotta go with chicago .
okay .
i' ve never had anyone stare at my ass for half an hour , so i' m gonna say good night .
and i' m hoping you' re gonna say it back .
okay .
i can take a hint .
i really do know a lot of people in the music business .
you just don' t give up , do ya ?
well , it was the sweet and innocent thing .

sorry to disappoint you , but i' m a songwriter , not a singer .
when i get on stage , i freeze .
what if the fate of the free world rested on your voice ?
okay .
if the fate of the free world depended on me singing , maybe .
all i ever really wanted is to sit in the dark ... and hear someone great singing my songs .
i wanna be the one who writes the music .
i remember the first time my mother played me " bridge over troubled water " ... by simon and garfunkel .
i remember exactly what she was wearing .
i remember exactly how her hair smelled .
i remember exactly how i felt .
and every time i hear that song ,
i remember exactly what she was wearing ... and exactly how her hair smelled ... and exactly how i felt .
' cause the great songs last forever .
so , what' s the problem ?
well ... now they' re telling me the only way to get my songs heard ... is to go out there and sing ' em myself .
so we' re gonna have to try fix this little problem straight away .
hmm .
and how do you propose we do that ?
well , is there any place you feel comfortable singing ?
the shower .
we' il start there .
i mean , i don' t care how long it takes , how many hours we have to spend in that shower .
let' s get to it .
okay .
before we hit the showers , maybe you could tell me a little something about yourself .
oh , really ?
what doyou wanna know ?
what part of australia are you from ?
i' m from all over .
my family moved around a lot .
so the rest ofyour family doesn' t live in new york ?
do you always ask this many questions ?
do you always dodge this many questions ?
you can at least tell me where you got all the moves you pulled on the bar tonight .
well , if i told you , i' d have to kill you .
that' s original .
oh .
the sun' s coming up .
we' re gonna be late .
late ?
late for what ?
this is incredible .
look at that fish !
all right .
put this on .
you' re gonna need it .
why ?
what are you talking about ?
you' re gonna help me unload the next bin .
you' re joking , right ?
no .
it' s not that bad , vi .
i do it all the time .
exactly how many jobs do you have ?
tuesday through saturday , i' m at the club .
sunday and monday i park cars at the plaza .
i' ve been a telemarketer .
would you like to switch to at& t ?
and for six terrifying hours i delivered phone books in queens .
don' t forget your extensive work in fish .
this is an expensive city , and these guys pay cash .
i don' t care if they pay in lobster .
i' m not sticking my hands in that fishy bin .
i was gonna split the money with you .
a hundred bucks a piece .
a hundred bucks ?
wait , wait .
why didn' tyou say so ?
thanks , dan .
you' re not ready , are you ?
fifty bucks .
wait .
no .
twenty five , ten .
ready ?
okay .
uh huh .
ooh !
that' s disgusting .
hey , you' il hurt their feelings .
okay .
just on top of the other fish .
so , i know i just met you a few days ago .
there' s something i have to tell you .
you smell really bad .
well , so do you .
i mean , i was gonna kiss you good bye , but , um , i thought i might gag .
you' re a real charmer .
okay .
good night .
good morning .
don' t look at me like that .

what are you doing here ?
i changed my mind about this kiss .
i think we should give it a shot .
well , have a nice day .

i mean , wow .

even the girls .
not a dry seat in the house .
you guys , that was , like , a one time performance  [ rachelsighs ]
hmm ?
that i have to repeat , like , every night .
yahoo !
she sang along with a jukebox .
let' s not start polishing a grammy .
oh , come on , rach .
she saved your butt .
admit it .
no .
she saved me from kicking the shit out of a couple of drunks .
that' s it .
ooh .
ooh , that was good .
where you goin ' ?
i don' t know .
i gotta walk or celebrate or
ugh , pass out or something .
hey , ladies and gents , how about a big round of applause for the singing coyote from jersey !
so i' m a coyote ?
five nights a week .
hey , what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
why would anything be wrong ?
um , you called me in the middle ofthe night and said there was an emergency .
what was that for ?
i had a good night .
i wanted a good night kiss .
well , wait a second .
where areyou going ?
have a nice day , mr. o' donnell . " have a nice day " ?
what' s going on ?
why do we need my guitar ?
you' il find out soon enough .
no .
this way .
okay , now there' s a seat .
just there .
uh huh ?
okay ?
take a look .
your fans wanna hear you sing .
i told you .
i i can' t sing my own songs .
i never could .
well , that' s too bad , because they' ve requested to hear your songs .
be gentle on the keyboard .
i borrowed it from the club .
you did all this just to help me sing ?
i thought maybe we could cure that stage fright i' ve heard so much about .
kevin , i wish you could .
come on , let me try .
tell me what it feels like .
you really wanna know ?
yeah .
you asked for it .
what are you doing ?
the only way i can show you ... is to make you ... really ... nervous .
the first thing that happens ... is my heart starts to race .
good .
racing heart .
yep .
got it .
and then ... my entire body starts shaking .
shaking body .
i' m i' m getting that .
yeah .
and ... then everything gets ... a bit ... cloudy .
clouds are definitely rolling in .
then i start ...
losing control .
well , how long does this usually last ?
oh , it' s been known to last all night .
that must be horrible .
it' s excruciating .
i think that audience got more than they paid for , really .
what' s " l. m. s. " standfor ?
lynn marie sanford .
it was my mom' s guitar .
she died five years ago .
she moved to new york to be a singer when she was my age .
she came pretty close to the big time .
well , what happened ?
she hated the stage .
she said it was the scariest place in the world .
sounds familiar .
you really want me to sing ?
just tell me what i have to do .
disappear .
all right .
no problem .
if you wanna write a song .
if you want to be like a serious songwriter , you simply gotta go with the mac .
laptop .
you can lay your tracks down on a blank cd , and you' re done .
do you do you have a payment plan ?
come on , cammie !
hey !
what are you doing ?
what are you , brain damaged ?
you know what kind of maniacs we got driving through here ?
they don' t stop for nothin ' .
whose boat ?
i borrowed it from a friend .
yeah ?
looks like a guy' s car to me .
how can you tell ?
i' ve been staring at cars every day for the last 16 years .
who is he ?
he' s a friend .
look , i brought you a turkey sandwich , no mayo , extra sprouts .
thank you .
great .
i' m starvin ' .
now tell me about this bar .
is it a bunch of bankers havin ' martinis afterwork ?
i gotta go .
look .
i loveyou .
i love you too .
be careful .
hey , do i come to your office and honk ?
come on !
i got you a gig .
there' s this club where a lot of music people hang out called the elbow room .
my friend' s the manager .
he owes me a favor , and you' re it , next thursday night .
are you forgetting about the stage fright ?
uh , what about the bar ?
come on , kevin .
all i do is sing along with the jukebox .
see ?
you' re making progress .
a few more nights at my place , and you' il be cured .
i hate to burst your bubble , but i' il never be cured .
it' s genetic .
stage fright dna .
yes , i saw that on e. r. last week .
okay .
laugh all you want , but my mom couldn' t do it , and neither can i.
so was your mother afraid to try ?
look , i just wanna be a song writer .
why won' t you give up on this ?
because i' ve been giving up on people my entire life , and it' s a nasty little habit .
so , you' re gonna sing at the club , or i' il
or you' il what ?
i' il never kiss you again .
that sounds like a threat , mr. o' donnell .
well , let' s just say ... it' s gonna be quite a long , cold winter .
that' s supposed to convince me ?
it' s working , isn' t it ?
your knees are getting weak .
i' il think about it .
try again .
uh , i' il see ifi can get offwork .
you' re gettin ' warmer .
all right .
you win .
i' il do it .
oh , i love winning .

it' s a goddamn sand box for you to stick your head in .
what is that supposed to mean ?
the place is a joke .

they don' t come to watch you sing .
they come to watch girls shaking it on a bar !
and what would you have me do ?
sing for quarters in the park ?
well , at least you' d be singing your own songs .
i told you i can' t do that , so stop pushing !
i' m just asking you to try , but i guess that' s asking a bit too much .
right .
it' s so easy to be you , isn' t it ?
you have no dreams , no hopes , no chance of getting hurt .
when was the last time you took a chance on something ?
some of us don' t have that luxury .
why is that ?
oh , right .
we don' t talk about you , right ?
it' s a big secret .
come on , kevin .
let' s play a game .
i' m gonna guess why you left australia .

you have a wife and four kids in sydney .
come on .
am i getting warm ?
come on , kevin .
i don' t have a lot of time .
why' d you run away from home ?
i didn' t have a home .
is that what you wanted to hear ?
i don' t have a family .
i mean , that' s the big secret .
are you happy ?
huh ?
are you gonna feel sorry for me now ?
you gonna hold me close while i tell you i had to change homes every two years ?
i had a bad childhood .
big deal .
i don' t need your sympathy , ' cause i' m here , and i' m living on my two feet like i wanted to .
that was my dream .
and at least i did it with a little bit of dignity .
and i didn' t .
that' s it ?
well, just unbutton the blouse a little and unzip the pants , show a little bit offlesh , i think you can figure it out .
go on in .
your fans are waitin ' for ya to crawl on a bar .
i told you not to break the rules .
what are you talking about ?
i' m talking about you and your boyfriend making a scene in my bar .
i' m talking about a friend of mine inside with a broken nose .
the rules were simple, jersey .
i' ve fired girls for a lot less .
what , so i can' t have a boyfriend now ?
what kind ofstupid shit is that ?
hey !
this place is my home , and i' m not willing to risk everything i have on your personal life .
it' s business , plain and simple .
this is not business .
i worked my ass off for you , and you' re supposed to be my friend .
i never said i was your friend .
i' m your boss , and you knew the rules like everybody else .
will you stop ... with " the rules " ?
it' s a bar , for christ' s sake !

because of me .
right after you were born , she told me she wanted to quit , and i let her .

i loved her ... more than anything .
and i just went on and pretended that there was no other choice .
