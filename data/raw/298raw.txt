3 years has past ever since noriko and i escaped from that island .
many students died from the br act .
but nobody could stop me and noriko from fighting back .
the world is now in the age of terrorism .
the anti br act organization ' wild seven ' leader , nanahara shuya , is wanted for his acts .
the adults started a new game in the name of ' justice ' .
' new century terrorist counter measure alternative ' .
also known as ' battle royale il '
the dice has been thrown .
we will never forget the adults who made us kill each other .
let us stand together .
let us fight together .
we are declaring war to all adults .

3 years ago , my father , who was a teacher , was shot by his own student .
the picture my father finished painting had a drawing of a girl .
when i found out that it wasnt me , i never went to school again .
and now , i' ve decided to join the game to confront my feelings about my dad .
wanted for murder and accessory nanahara shuya , nakagawa noriko
brii bright , cheerful , fun thank you for registering !
and so i enrolled at shikanotoride middle school .
a ragtag collection of losers and delinquents from across all of japan .
we' d all been written off by adults .
buncha jocks !
none of us had any real future .
for me , the only thing that felt real was my pain .

the international symbol of guerilla resistance .
3 years it survived from former game to come out also one name female child
20      .
400  ,
other countries tried to ignore it as if it was already over .
but even under those hellish conditions , their smiles were always those of pride .
the open smiles of the children .
so what ?
what the hell' s that got to do with us ?
what are you fighting for now ?
listen , kill me and the game' s over .
but would your struggle end ?
can you forget all this , and resume your old lives ?

until the day that we can smile in the same open way as the children we saw .
shuya !

i don' t have a clue to what the hell your pulling .

you aim a gun , you shoot it .
this is what it takes to survive .
yuuma ?
yuuma ? !
yuuma !
down !
hq !
this is mamiya !
the students have gone over to the terrorists !
we' re being slaughtered !
send reinforcements !
sir !
sir ?

day three 12/ 25 christmas

all of you , survive ...
don' t forget about me .
don' t for ... get ...
nozomi !
sagisawa !
girl # 6 nozomi sagisawa .
dead .
10 to go
we' ve lost another friend .
now , what are we supposed to do ?
answer me !
there' s no answer .
you' ve got to find it for yourself .
taku !
we never had anywhere we could go , i knew that all along .
no place to call our home .
you' re all fighting for your lives !
this is war right ?
but die and you' re just one more victim .
even those poor little kids .
you' re all the same .
you' re no better than the adults !
how i wish this war would end .
how can i answer all those who have died ?
i don' t know ...
but inevitably , we' il all grow up to become adults .
the best survivors can do , is to remember the ones who died .
always and forever .
even after we grow up .
hello ?
hello ...
what are you doing ?
i told you to knock .
you stink .
don' t come in here .
listen , today' s your birthday right ?
i thought that you , mom and i could go out .
you' re the worst .
what ?
my birthday was yesterday .
isn' t it today ?
it was yesterday .
just get out .
listen , shiori ...
still got more to say ?
what ?
i guess , i should ... do this , right ?
what an idiot .
the thing people fear most , isn' t death , but being forgotten .
we' re all here now .
we all wanted someone to know .
you' il be just fine , just fine .
you don' t keep losing your temper because you' re sick .
if you make friends at this school , you' il get better .
because all the kids here are just like you .
i promise i' il come and get you .
please , let' s go .
one day , they' il all disappear .
family , friends ...
but i' il always be by your side .
i can' t do anything for you , but i' il be there .
i promise ...
nobu ...
kawada , all you guys ...
i' m not wrong , am i ?
i' m fighting along ... with the best of you , right ?
you ok ?
mimura !
run !
shit !
blowing away a couple of guys won' t change a thing in this country !
but i don' t know any other way .
survive this !
and don' t look back !
and then , finally the rain stopped .
how much blood has been shed ?
how many tears spilled ?
all of our friends who fought beside us are dead , killed in the last 3 years .
but even as justice can never be vanquished , we terrorists will never vanish , however evil they deem us .
because we know , that a handful of adults , selfishly define the nature of peace as freedom in this world .
but our world is so much more complex than theirs .
this world has 63 billion people living their own lives ,
living 63 billion different ways , 63 billion kinds of peace , 63 billion kinds of justice , 63 billion kinds of war and evil .
and no one has achieved peace ... without fighting for it .
behind every peace , there' s a river of blood , sweat and tears .
it' s going live to global host computers .
but if we avert our eyes from that history and abandon it , then peace might as well be dogshit .
dogshit , huh ... ?
japan , china ,
north korea ,
guatemala , indonesia ,
cuba , congo ,
peru , laos ,
vietnam , cambodia ,
grenada , libya ,
el salvador , nicaragua , panama ,
iraq , somalia , , sudan ,
jugoslavia , afghanistan .
you may be lonely , but it' s time to stop being afraid .
to all the abandoned children on earth ,
let' s rise up together and fight together !
we' re throwing away the old rules , taken from a place far , far away !
tonight , i send this message to all the adults who stole our freedom and pinned us down .
merry christmas .
wild seven and nanahara shuya .
evacuate !
you ok ?
look after the baby , the children ...
who fired the missile ? !
we' re still investigating !
sir , a call for you .
who the hell is it ?
it' s ... the prime minister .
put him through .
yes sir .
hey teacher , what a mess , huh ?
who do you think fired those missiles ?
we finally pissed that country off !
i just got a call from their president .
they' re going to attack in 12 hours .
what the hell' s going on with your class ? !
what are you waiting for ? !
so what if a dozen kids die , it doesn' t matter !
fire a missile and blow up the whole damned island !
you really mean that ?
you surprise me .
i thought you were a full fledged adult who' d cross the line a long time ago .
you do understand , there are only two sides , the winners and losers .
which side are you on ?
fight with that country for justice and freedom ...
cut the crap , you murderer !
what ?
half a century ago , that country compared ours to a 12 year old .
how old does that make that country now ?
if any country pisses it off , it just bombs them .
you call that adult behavior ? !
listen , the whole world' s rallied by that country .
and who made that choice ? !
so what the hell are you doing there ?
i see .
too bad .
i had hopes for you .
exercising my full power as prime minister , i call upon the armed forces .
prepare for battle immediately .
before that country launches its missiles
i want every last terrorist and nanahara shuya ,
dead !
attention !
salute !
taku !
taku ...
taku ... ?
takuma ?
kuze ...
you ok ?
i can' t really move .
but we' ve got to get back or nao will worry .
you' re hurt , save your strength .
how ironic ...
what ?
i have waited too long with telling you takuma ...
i kind of like you ...
i had to say it before i die .
but ... but ... now ...
kuze !
girl # 5 kuze haruka .

it' s nearly dawn .
our battle with the adults is about to begin .
in the 6 months we' ve been here , we' ve stumbled upon a mine shaft .
it might lead back to the mainland .
take the children and escape .
what about you ?
we' il stay here and draw the enemy in .
this is no place for you .
the real struggle lies ahead .
truly ,
living life is 100 times harder than dying .
