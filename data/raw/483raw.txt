you sure it' s the russians ?
one hundred percent , sir .
submarine launched ... 12 to 15 megatons , and they went to strike status 15 minutes prior .
clnc lant reports the roosevelt splashed six incoming cruise missiles .
the russians are moving west through poland .
if they head for germany , the berlin brigade is outnumbered .
we' ve got another launch from alyesk , central russia .
i don' t believe it .
what the hell' s in alyesk ?
ss 18 icbms .
probable targets ...
new york , washington , here .
how good is this ceiling ?
anything but a direct hit .
satellites confirm birds in the air ... multiple launches .
first impact estimated 25 minutes .
how do we know that' s accurate ?
it' s accurate .
sir , i advise we go to defcon 1 .
get president zorkin on the hot line .
zorkin is missing .
we have reports of a coup in moscow .
general bulgakov is calling the shots now .
who the hell is bulgakov ?
the asshole who wanted to use nukes in chechnya .
sir , defcon 1 , we' re out of time .
do it .
mr. president .
after you give the order , the launch sequence takes a minute to process .
before the order can be taken , an i. d. check must be performed .
my i. d. number is fifth from the top .
sir , it' s your wife on 2104 .
thank you .
under the two man rule ... the order must be confirmed by someone on the approved list .
gene revell , national security advisor .
second from the top .
is it black tie ?
okay , i' m on my way .
can we ... finish this up some other time ?
we gotta update these fire drills , billy .
if the shit ever hits the fan , i' m not goin ' underground .
the place is a goddamn tomb .
we have to choose someone to face off against besides the russians .
really ?
let' s see .
who else has 27, 000 nukes for us to worry about ?
it' s the guy with one i' m worried about .
speaking of russia , i have to send some folks over there ... inspect their nuclear decommissioning facility .
place called " armazaz .
arzamas .
yeah .
whatever .
someone from your staff should be on the trip .
i' il go .
billy , send staff .
i wanna go .
okay .
and don' t underestimate zorkin , pal .
between his economy , crime , chechnya ...
his liver .
what' s left of it .
how is he ?
he' s scheduled a press conference for this afternoon ... so at least we know he can sit up .
why not negotiate ?
the interview is over .
only criminals and their friends in the west wish it to be separate .
but , mr. president , if you will kindly come back ... we do have a few more questions we would like to ask you .
you see what i see ?
his jacket .
he used to button it all the way .
he' s gettin ' fat !
i know how he feels .
wow .
look at that .
maybe it' s not the same jacket .
no ...
yeah .
shiny sleeves .
he wore it last time he got out of the hospital .
he' s definitely off the diet .
he' s also off the wagon .
you hear how he slurred ?
that must be why chelinski' s hanging around , to keep him off the sauce .
where' s chelinski ?
next to ...
what' s her name ?
the chick with the brown hair .
elena rishkov .
no , that is not chelinski .
busted .
it' s chelinski .
you' re thinking cherpitski .
that ain' t cherpitski , either .
i know .
it' s chelinski .
no , it' s not .
trust me .
he' s next to elena rishkov .
he was banging her at the geneva summit .
chelinski was not at geneva .
cherpitski was at geneva .
what are you saying ?
cherpitski was banging elena rishkov ?
i say zorkin' s putting on weight .
why reduce everything to sex ?
i agree .
write it up .
and if he is putting on weight ... that might have health consequences so get it in the afternoon brief .
and somebody find out who is banging elena rishkov .
this is good .
what shall we make of chechnya ... asking the west for protection ?
she is like a beautiful virgin ... escaping the clutches of a lecherous bear ... and running to bill clinton to save her maidenhood .
meet the new boss , same as the old boss .
he could have been writing of us , of europe in the 21st century .
over 50 years of america and russia ... imposing their will on the european community ...
east and west .
and we are still treated like children ... but without the toys or the good night chocolates .
each day we lose a little bit more of our separate ... sovereign ability to determine our own futures .
and each day the world comes closer to that terrible moment ... when the beating of a butterfly' s wings ... unleashes a hurricane ...
god himself cannot stop .
was that yours or mine ?
it must be yours .
mine' s just for show .
it' s not the hospital .
cool .
good .
hi .
you' re still here ?
i think to be accurate and everything ... it' s actually you are still here .
oh .
right .
not that i' m complaining .
jack ?
i know this is new and all , but ...
i have something i have to say or i' m gonna explode .
i don' t want you to be scared .
what ?
you' re in love with me .
i' m a medical professional .
i can read the symptoms .
you' re definitely in love with me .
and that scares you .
not even a little .
but i think it scares you .
no .
not even a little .
and , for the record , you' re the one who brought it up .
forget it .
i' m gonna get it .
no , wait .
it' il stop .
i don' t know who this is .
but ...
just go about your business .
the timing sucks .
do what you have to do .
i totally understand .
yes .
this is dr. muller .
muller .
you paged me ?
hello ?
stop .
yes , this is jack ryan .
jesus .
okay .
i' il be there in half an hour .
i gotta go .
i have an emergency at work .
i have to run .
i' m sorry .
cathy , how about dinner tonight ?
yeah .
how about tomorrow night ?
jack , i said yes to tonight .
i know .
what kind of emergency does an historian have ?
he died at 04 20 zulu .
eight and a half hours later , they swore in a new president .
everybody wants to know who this new guy is .
who is he ?
alexander nemerov .
you' re kidding me .
i wrote a paper about him a year ago .
i know .
mary pat , i said he could be next .
i said he could be next .
i predicted this .
and nobody read it .
they' re reading it now .
who ?
cabot .
i' ve been here 14 months .
i don' t think he knows what i look ...
are you ryan ?
yes , sir .
what is this ?
the paper chase ?
sir , my ...
come on .
we' re late .
you' re about to breathe air that' s over your pay grade , so listen up .
you' re gonna be asked for analysis and advice .
be sure you know what you' re talking about before you give it .
don' t be afraid to say you don' t know .
choose your words carefully .
words have a habit of becoming policy .
you , you .
give me your coat .
come on .
you' il get it back .
tie .
so , intelligence committee ?
mm hmm .
i' ve watched these on c span .
never actually been to one .
you' ve never watched one of these on c span .
our most important assessment comes from a high source in the kremlin .
in his opinion , nemerov does not owe his ascension to the military .
everyone has opinions , mr. cabot .
i respect that .
this morning my wife woke up and said i was old , bald and ugly .
is that a question , mr. chairman ?
i told her appearances aren' t everything .
would you agree , mr. cabot ?
i certainly would , sir .
now , this new fellow " nezmeroz " ...
is that his name ?
nemerov , sir .
despite what your source says , we hear " nezmeroz " is a hard liner .
is he a hard liner ?
no .
it' s a bit too soon to make that assessment , sir .
according to cnn ... your mr. " nezmeroz " is making promises ... to rebuild the russian empire .
that sounds pretty rash from where i sit .
if i were sitting in chechnya , i' d be even more worried .
sir , nemerov' s saying what he needs to get the hard liners off his back .
if we leave him alone , russia will stabilize .
push him , bets are off .
when i asked for your advice , i didn' t mean you should actually speak .
yes , sir .
mr. cabot .
mr. chairman , some of our assets in the russian government ... who actually know mr. nemerov , have not had a chance to report in .
i' d like to take a couple of days ... and get more information for you before characterizing him .
but i do maintain my opinion that appearances can be deceiving .
you' re saying i' m wrong ?
absolutely , mr. chairman .
i don' t think you' re ugly .
i apologize for being out of line .
senators don' t like surprises .
i give them a hint of what i' m going to tell them ... then i give them a while to get used to it .
then i tell them .
i understand .
good .
but i' m right about nemerov .
your girlfriend like this stubborn streak in you ?
what ?
cathy muller , second year surgical resident ...
baltimore memorial hospital .
welcome to the cla , sport .
well , your intelligence is just a little flawed in this matter .
i wouldn' t call her my girlfriend yet .
what exactly would you call her ?
great .
amazing .
she' s just afraid to commit .
he' s terrified of commitment .
the man is afraid of commitment after three dates ?
alert the media .
i know , i know .
what does he do ?
he was in the marines before he hurt his back .
now he' s an historian .
yawn .
no .
he works for a think tank across the river .
double yawn .
all right , rita .
let' s see what you have to say after you meet him tonight .
he' s ...
cute ?
i have fat fingers .
cathy !
cute scale .
one to ten .
oh , god !
i don' t know .
twelve .
ask them where they found this .
in the field , in the golan .
there was a lot of fighting in 1973 .
did they witness it ?
this one says he lost his son .
does he remember ?
was there a plane shot down ?
yes .
an israeli jet , destroyed .
this is worthless .
but tell him ...
i will give him $400 because of his son .
thank ...
thank you .
you don' t find this lying around .
absolutely not .
how did you come by it ?
i found her in the attic of an old mansion in glasgow .
all right .
your trip to the attic actually has got you a piece worth ... the best part of a thousand pounds , even in this condition .
had she been in better condition , even more .
ajolly nice find .
hello ?
cathy .
so glad you called .
i' m running a little late .
i' m sorry .
can you come a half an hour later ?
i can' t make it .
i' m really sorry .
it was a last minute work thing .
what' s that noise ?
i' m calling from a plane .
this just came up .
i tried to call .
where are you going ?
i can' t tell you that .
jack .
you can' t tell me where you' re going ?
hold on one second .
yes , sir ?
what are you doing ?
i had a date tonight , so i had to call and cancel .
don' t be stupid .
tell her where you' re going .
in fact , tell her who you work for .
she' il be impressed .
in fact , tell her who you work for .
she' il be impressed .
i work for the cla and the director asked me at the last minute ... to come with him to russia to do a nuclear arms inspection .
that is so lame .
i swear .
we' re making sure ... they' re decommissioning their nuclear arsenal .
thanks .
thanks a lot .
zdrastuyte " , william cabot .
president nemerov .
pleasure , sir .
may i present mrs. lathrop .
mr. president .
general rand .
mr. president .
and dr. ryan .
mr. president .
you must be the dr. ryan who' s done such interesting research on me .
you should not be surprised by this .
we know quite a bit .
for instance , we know how wrong you were that ...
i had many girlfriends in college .
i met my wife in my third year and haven' t looked at other women since .
i was referring to the first two years ... sir .
i like him .
in that case , so do i.
let me apologize for interjecting myself in your inspection tour .
but there is a message i wish for you to take to president fowler .
you could just call him on the phone .
i would like him to hear it from you , his friend of many years ... who received it personally from me ... saw my expression and the language of my body as i spoke it .
i understand .
chechnya is an internal affair .
what we do there should be none of your concern .
i will relay the message , but i don' t think he will agree .
there are those in my country who will use this issue to weaken me .
there are those in my country who say your war in chechnya ... is exactly your weakness .
chechnya is a nation of criminals .
every day brings another cowardly attack on innocent russian citizens .
it is none of your concern .
stability is our concern .
peace in chechnya is our concern .
and , if i may speak frankly ... your control over your military concerns us too .
for you to get involved here , it' s ...
like sleeping with another man' s wife .
and what you are suggesting is that afterward ... they can all live together under the same roof .
but what really happens is ... the betrayed husband buys a gun .
that went well .
who' s the guy with nemerov ?
anatoli grushkov .
old kgb ?
been lurking around since brezhnev .
plays all sides .
and nobody' s had the guts to get rid of him .
is that because he knows where the bodies are buried ?
probably because he buried them himself .
and we were able to obtain a roster of their scientists at arzamas .
who' s who , what their expertise is .
arzamas 16 is home to the all russian ...
scientific research institute of experimental physics and ... is the birthplace of our first atomic bomb .
many of our greatest scientists worked here and many still do .
since 1995 ...
we tried so hard to get in here over the years .
i sent three people .
they all died trying .
what does the t shirt say ?
i am a bomb technician .
if you see me running ... try to catch up .
sir ?
i' m sorry .
just one quick thing .
i' m sure it' s nothing .
according to this , there are 17 senior scientists on duty today .
i only count 14 .
doctors milinov , orlov and spassky .
they don' t seem to be here .
i will make inquiries .
dr. milinov is out sick .
orlov is on vacation .
spassky , i' m grieved to say , was killed ... driving his car to work just this past week .
we move on , shall we ?
please .
very impressive .
you almost seemed to have that information memorized .
i assumed you would ask , dr. ryan .
we touch down at andrews at 2130 .
tell him to meet me there .
sir , those three missing scientists ?
milinov' s expertise is detonators .
spassky' s expertise is the package , the nuclear core itself .
and orlov is a mathematician whose expertise is the geometry ... of high explosives inside a fission bomb .
exact three men you would need if you wanted to build a bomb .
grushkov would have us believe ...
grushkov' s a liar .
milinov is not sick .
orlov hasn' t taken a vacation in years .
and spassky , who' s supposed to have died driving a car , doesn' t drive .
they have no idea where these guys are .
i' m dying to ask you how you know that .
secure source inside the kremlin .
spinnaker .
he gives me stuff .
i give him stuff .
we keep the back channels open in hopes of staving off disaster .
and speaking of disaster , did you call your girlfriend yet ?
no .
i haven' t figured out how i' m gonna dig myself out of this .
listen .
call her up and invite her ... to the white house correspondents ' dinner sunday night .
it' s the hottest ticket in town .
she' il love it .
that sounds great .
how do i get in ?
trust me .
i' il see you at the car .
still loving your desk job ?
yeah , i am .
how' s your russian ?
it still works .
why ?
three russian nuclear scientists are missing .
i need to know where they are .
i thought i wasn' t doing this anymore .
i just need information this time, johnny .
your orders are on the plane .
wheels up at 2330 .
have a nice flight .
sunday night at 8 : 00 at the hilton .
the tickets are under the name of john clark .
you do have a tux ?
yeah !
yes , sir .
my beautiful wife , julie ... is from new jersey ... 15 electoral votes .
and is , as you know , half jewish ... so we' il take florida' s 25 electoral votes and divide by two .
this is a nice hotel .
yeah , it' s beautiful .
my friend rita stayed here once .
she said it was real nice .
maybe after dinner , we can ...
i don' t know .
we could get a room .
i already did .
she reminds me that i have publicly acknowledged ...
no , you didn' t .
yes , i did .
i did , on a handful of occasions , smoke marijuana .
california ... 54 electoral votes .
at approximately 0600 , moscow time , the russians launched ... a massive artillery strike against grozny , the capital of chechnya .
the shells contained an experimental chemical weapon ... known as the novichok binary nerve agent .
on those infrared sat photos , you can see saturation took 20 minutes .
after which , every man , woman and child ... inside a radius of 12 miles was rendered helpless ... by symptoms approximating acute , late stage cerebral palsy .
how many dead ?
best guess , 80 percent .
which means , nemerov just launched ... the most massive attack in the history of chemical warfare .
let' s talk response .
worst thing we could do is nothing .
i agree .
let him get away with chemical weapons , what' s next ?
biological ?
nuclear ?
okay .
short of gassing the kremlin , what' s our strongest response ?
we send in peacekeepers .
chechnya' s not sovereign .
they requested recognition , so we recognize them .
not full diplomatic recognition .
provisional .
then we get the chechens to request emergency international assistance .
and we send in peacekeepers .
how do you get them in there ?
fly them in from turkey .
over armenian airspace ?
to screw russia , they won' t complain .
let' s do it .
nemerov can choke on it .
bill .
dr. ryan .
yes , sir ?
what do you think ?
mr. president , conventional wisdom would suggest that nemerov ... is playing the traditional russian role ... be aggressive , flex your muscles ... dare the world to stop you .
but nemerov isn' t conventional .
he walks like a hard liner , talks like a hard liner .
yes , but with all due respect , i don' t think he is one .
he gassed another country' s capital .
with all due respect , you' re wrong .
why are we wasting our time ?
what if he didn' t order the attack ?
what if nemerov didn' t order the attack ?
what if it was ... a rogue general or a splinter military unit ... frustrated they couldn' t get their rebels out of the city ?
have you any reason to believe he didn' t order it or are you ... just floating this ?
you don' t know .
i don' t think he did it , sir .
i would bet he didn' t do it .
if i could ask senior staff to remain behind , please .
roger , we have to interrupt because we' re going back to moscow ... where russia' s newly installed president , alexander nemerov ... has just begun to address the state .
we join him in progress .
for ten years now , we have contended ...
excuse me , sir ?
would you mind turning that up ?
finally ... every nation has a right to defend itself .
this terrorism must end .
the bombing of chechnya was my decision .
nice goin ' , ace .
and how is our russian friend affected by this ?
i am not affected .
i remain devoted to our little plan .
at what you' re charging us , i am not surprised .
and the american ?
mr. mason is a believer .
i put a little extra in the escrow account for him .
why ?
because he won' t live long enough to receive it .
where is the package ?
it left haifa a week ago .
i' m told these things can kill you .
but so much has changed .
perhaps the new situation ... suggests we consider a different approach ?
maybe try to bring russia ... more into europe , more into our way of thinking .
we have discussed that , monsieur monceau .
and with your concurrence , rejected it .
oh , perhaps we were hasty .
perhaps our plan is ...
is what ?
well , not perfectly conceived .
well , i respect the will and judgment of my friends .
but in light of the week' s events , i am grown ... uncomfortable with this plan .
so i must beg your leave .
gentlemen .
herr haft will help you out .
your scarf , monsieur .
mason , would you watch it with that ?
you' re gonna kill someone .
yo , what' s up , mason ?
i always wanted to ask you .
where' d you get that tat , man ?
the navy .
navy ?
i was in the navy .
hospital ship , six years .
you ?
eight months .
oh .
you wash out ?
all right , brother .
you have a good one .
yeah , brother .
you' ve got to realize the russian world is watching ... and they' re gonna take the cue from us and what we ... the unprecedented attack on chechnya ... signals a dangerous and troubling shift in russian policy .
it demands the toughest and most unambiguous response from the west .
nato forces are on their way to chechnya to serve as peacekeepers ... and to provide desperately needed humanitarian relief .
victims of this monstrous ...
these are four hours old .
russian 12th , 15th and 2nd tank regiments .
they haven' t moved .
why haven' t they moved ?
nemerov' s too smart to move tanks .
he speaks .
jack , look .
nemerov' s got , like , what , 19, 000 tanks ?
no way nato can match that .
that' s why he won' t move them .
it' s a chess game .
he' s thinking three moves ahead .
he knows he has more tanks than we do .
nato says the only way to stop them is by using tactical nuclear weapons .
and there' s no way he wants to risk a nuclear war over this .
i also think he' s sending us a message .
he didn' t bomb grozny .
clark got us her number .
nsa collected records of all calls made to that number and traced it ... back to here , an abandoned soviet army base outside cherkassy ... on the kremenchug reservoir .
what are three russian atomic scientists doing in ukraine ?
fair guess , they' re building a bomb .
nemerov has thousands of bombs .
why does he need to build a secret one ?
deniability .
build one nobody knows about .
he could drive it to chechnya in the trunk of his beemer .
no way to track it .
no way to trace it .
and he could set it off , sit back and say , " i didn' t do it .
with all due respect , sir , i don' t think that adds up .
it adds up .
you just don' t like what it adds up to .
the explosive blocks must be replaced ... and machined to a thousandth of a millimeter ... in a mathematically determined configuration .
do we have a bomb ?
first , we must analyze the yield ... spassky ... do we have a bomb ?
yes .
yes , we do .
this is a test .
yeah .
answer it .
answer it .
you sure ?
yeah .
hello ?
yes .
yes , sir .
i have to go outside for just a second .
okay ?
i' il be right back .
i' il be right back .
one second .
i write reports .
i reviewed your military records .
you can take care of yourself .
yes , sir , but i' m not trained for that .
i' m asking you to be my eyes and ears , not an operations officer .
i can' t go .
so , this isn' t sanctioned .
give this to clark , see what he finds out , bring it home .
yes , sir .
we never had this discussion .
what discussion ?
okay .
clark ?
this is three days ago , and it shows vehicles here ... guards here and here .
i oughta get one of those .
the infrared satellite , in position 34 hours ago , took this photograph .
it shows guards here and here .
i don' t even have e mail .
two more at the checkpoint .
between two and five in the barracks , two with the package .
which we believe to be here .
no problem .
give me a couple of guys , a box of tranquilizer darts .
if we' re lucky , we can be out in six minutes .
actually , there is a problem .
what' s that ?
this is yesterday .
no guards visible at all .
and why is that a problem , mr. ryan ?
for two reasons .
either we can' t see ' em , which is bad ... or , worse , they left , and we' re too late .
suit up .
what ?
you can' t go dressed like that .
no , no .
besides , i' m an analyst .
i don' t go on the , you know , missions .
relax , 007 , it' s not a mission .
it' s just a recce .
fine .
whatever you call it , i don' t do that .
i just write reports .
okay .
so write a report about it .
suit up !
clark , no !
cabot tells me you got my ticket to the correspondents ' dinner .
have a good time ?
never been to one of those .
was actually looking forward to it .
clark , no .
i' m not going in there .
goddamn right , you' re not .
you' il stay and make sure nobody steals my boat .
be right back .
damn .
oh , god .
immigration didn' t call you guys , huh ?
i' m sorry .
you speak english ?
i don' t speak ukrainian .
you ?
i know this doesn' t look good .
i' m an american citizen .
my papers ...
okay , no papers .
please , just put the gun down .
all right ?
the light .
put the light down .
okay , okay .
take it easy .
i' il put the light down .
here we go .
i' m putting it down .
shoot him , ryan .
shoot him .
shoot him before he figures out what i' m saying .
get their shoes .
what ?
tell them to take their shoes off .
you speak ukranian .
yeah .
you don' t ?
whatever it is they were spray painting was big .
about the size of a fridge .
the imprint it left was deep , so we know three things ... it was heavy ... something was radioactive ... and now it' s gone .
one of them spoke english ?
south african .
okay , so the question is ... what' s a south african doing in the ukraine ... with three russian scientists and a crate from israel ?
tell cabot i' il call him from haifa .
i have a feeling you' d better hurry .
most people believe the 20th century was defined ... by the death struggle of communism versus capitalism ... and that fascism was but a hiccup .
today we know better .
communism was a fool' s errand .
the followers of marx , gone from this earth .
but the followers of hitler abound and thrive .
hitler , however , had one great disadvantage .
he lived in a time when fascism , like a virus ... like the alds virus ... needed a strong host in order to spread .
germany was that host .
but , strong as it was , germany could not prevail .
the world was too big .
fortunately , the world has changed .
global communications , cable tv ... the internet .
today the world is smaller ... and a virus does not need a strong host in order to spread .
this virus ... is airborne .
one more thing .
let no man call us crazy .
they called hitler crazy , but hitler wasn' t crazy .
he was stupid .
you don' t fight russia and america .
you get russia and america to fight each other ... and destroy each other .
so what' d you find ?
ukraine doesn' t have a thriving export economy , but it' s on line .
i pulled up every shipping manifest for the past two weeks .
the only crate the size of that imprint ... was picked up at kiev international ten days ago ... and flown to the canary islands .
i can' t find cabot .
the air force has a nuclear assessment team .
call them and tell them ...
it got put on a cargo freighter headed for the east coast .
what ?
baltimore , jack .
it' s coming here .
it' s another spectacular view from the budweiser blimp ... as we count down to game time .
we' il have all the rest of the pregame festivities ... as well as the arrival of the nation' s number one football fan ... in just a moment .
then conquer we must for our cause it is just and this be our motto in god is our trust and the star spangled banner forever shall wave
o' er the land of the free
then give me the duty officer !
and the home of the brave
ladies and gentlemen ... the president of the united states ... robert fowler .
show time .
shit !
fifteen yard penalty .
first down .
that' s the way !
shit .
sir !
hello ?
sir !
shit !
yeah ?
cabot .
it' s ryan .
what ?
the bomb is in play !
dillon' s called the afra team .
they' re meeting me at the docks in 20 minutes to see if we can find it .
docks ?
what docks ?
baltimore .
you' re breaking up .
what did you say ?
i' m losing you .
i' il call you back ... baltimore !

let' s go !
let' s go !
excuse me !
excuse me !
let' s go !
let' s go !
step back !
go , go , go , go !
move !
move !
what' s going on ?
sir , stay down .
the russian scientists have been working on a bomb .
nuclear .
it arrived in baltimore this morning .
get those people out of the stadium !
we' re on it !
stay down !
all we know is , the president has been taken off ...
all set .
thanks, j. j.
clearly something has happened of tremendous proportion .
we have no word yet or confirmation as to what ... but there is an enormous cloud over ...
go , go , go !
come with me !
mr. president !
mr. president !
are you all right ?
he' s stuck !
he' s stuck !
get out of the way !
mr. president , are you all right ?
are you all right , mr. president ?
the marines will take you home , sir .
i need your help , danny .
alvarez , get me a stretcher !
now !
you got the stretcher ?
you got the stretcher ?
no , i don' t want one .
okay .
let' s go , let' s go !
let' s go !
move it !
move it , move it !
go , go !
close the mouth !
got ' em !
hey !
it' s ryan !
jack , where are you ?
i don' t know .
somewhere outside baltimore .
cabot got the president out .
where' s the president now ?
they' re taking him airborne .
he' s on naoc .
why ?
they think it may be the russians .
it wasn' t the russians .
i gotta talk to cabot .
can you patch me through to the plane ?
cabot' s not aboard .
we don' t know where he is .
can you call back in an hour ?
we don' t have an hour !
fowler will want to show how tough he is .
he' s gonna hit back , now !
listen to me .
we must prove it wasn' t the russians before he' s convinced it is .
can you get back to langley ?
there' s no time !
there must be a command post on site .
the radiation assessment team ... where are they ?
stambler tunnels , south of the city .
stambler tunnels , south of the city .
the prevailing winds are blowing the fallout from east to north .
as long as you stay south , you' re okay .
mr. president , are you all right ?
how the hell do you think i am ?
how many casualties ?
we don' t know .
cabot said it was russian .
how did it get in there ?
we don' t know .
radar didn' t pick it up , so it wasn' t a missile .
how is cabot ?
where is he ?
i don' t know .
well , what do you know ?
i don' t know !
all right .
i don' t know , for christ' s sake !
general , prozain and kondor are not on board .
mr. president , i recommend that we move to defcon 2 .
where' s our intelligence ?
russian air defenses have moved to their highest level .
maybe they' re afraid of an attack .
i can' t get this goddamned chair to open !
sir , defcon status ?
we' re about to take off .
we don' t know who did it .
we think russia' s at high alert .
excuse me .
you think ?
sir ?
defcon 2 ?
we' re groping in the dark ...
this is too much goddamn bullshit !
not enough fact .
the blast crater is about 100 , maybe 140 yards wide ... which suggests a relatively low yield device .
quite a bit smaller than , say , the hiroshima bomb .
maybe a quarter of a square mile around the stadium is just gone .
beyond that , buildings remain ... although heavily damaged for another quarter mile or so .
the damage appears to taper off further away from ground zero .
herr haft has left for america .
and now we are counting on you .
i assure you , i will earn every pfennig .
the ash isn' t radioactive , and winds are blowing the fallout to sea .
jack ryan , cla .
lorna shiro .
you need to wait outside with everybody else .
i don' t think so .
i need to know everything you know about the bomb .
look , pal , we' re collecting samples and analyzing the debris ... so take a number , get in line , and we' il have the report tomorrow .
captain , i don' t have time for this .
where did this bomb come from ?
i' il settle for where it didn' t come from , but i need to know now ... otherwise there may not be a tomorrow .
shit .
wesson , where are you ?
about a quarter mile from ground zero .
i think this is about as far as we go .
our feet are sizzling .
i' m getting rads here nearly the limit of our gear .
okay , cut the rover loose and get the hell out of there .
roger that .
the crate the bomb was shipped in ... somebody signed for it at the port .
customs must have a database .
get me a name .
and where' s cabot ?
no one knows .
we' re checking the hospitals .
have you tried memorial ?
he wouldn' t be there .
no , i mean , is it still ...
it' s cathy' s hospital .
as far as i know it' s still there .
but the phones are down .
can you keep checking for me ?
thanks .
they could' ve launched a cruise missile .
dsp sats might' ve missed it .
we don' t know this is russia .
but we don' t know it' s not .
if they were sending us a message , like " stay out of chechnya " ... the whole point would be for us to know it was them .
except that they could inspire the confusion we' re going through now .
mr. president , we' re uplinked .
president nemerov , a short time ago ... there was a major nuclear event on the eastern seaboard of the us .
loss of life is severe .
it was no accident .
it was not an accident .
we don' t yet know where it came from , we don' t ...
we have not yet ascertained the source of this weapon .
rest assured ...
whoa , that was a little fast .
please accept the deepest sympathies of the russian people .
if it was deliberate , this is a crime without precedent .
what madman would do such a thing , and for what purpose ?
you must believe russia had nothing to do with this infamous act .
it' s canned .
they prepared that in advance .
president nemerov , we have no reason to suspect russian involvement ... at this time .
tao , ew .
i' m picking up intermittent radar bearing 020 .
where ?
now it' s gone .
there !
it' s a weak signal .
low on the horizon .
tao , alr sup .
inbound contact !
multiples on the same bearing !
vampire !
vampire !
fast movers inbound !
i got seven , eight ... nine of them !
the missiles came from russian aircraft .
grennel thinks he can save the ship , but flight ops are definitely out .
... until we investigate all possibilities .
like you did in chechnya ?
mr. president , who is in control of your armed forces ?
mr. president ... we are now at a de facto state of war with the russians .
john clark was in haifa yesterday .
i don' t know where he is today , but he may have something .
find him .
check out that gadolinium reading .
yeah , the mass fraction is huge .
okay , connect me to dillon .
i' il hold .
there it is .
savannah river .
oh , yeah .
" oh , yeah " what ?
always had that gadolinium problem .
hanford does it another way .
they always generate too much promethium .
hold on .
can you translate that into english ?
this plutonium came from the doe plant at savannah river ...
february of' 68 , from " k " reactor .
you can even tell which part of " k " reactor .
wait , this is our plutonium ?
made in the usa .
you gotta find cabot .
are you advocating we launch a first strike ?
it is not a first strike !
there' s already been a first strike , and a second !
don' t you get it ?
no , i don' t !
i don' t understand why we have to nuke them !
it' s not reasonable !
sidney , goddamn it !
they practically sank an aircraft carrier !
their missile silos are hot .
we' re getting nothing but bullshit from nemerov .
and let' s not forget how this thing started .
they tried to kill me !
remember ?
so don' t fucking tell me to be reasonable .
sir ?
sir .
what ?
the president .
the president' s fine .
he' s fine .
the bomb .
the plutonium was ...
wife .
what ?
wife .
your wife .
i' m sure she' s fine .
she' s in dc .
the blast radius wasn' t that ... wasn' t that wide .
here .
sir , now listen to me .
the plutonium was ours .
john clark' s in haifa right now trying to find the arms dealer .
i can' t get a hold of him ... and i don' t know what to do .
girlfriend .
she works in baltimore , so ...
i don' t know .
spinnaker .
what ?
spinnaker .
sir ?
bill ?
yeah , jack , just got in .
we found the receiver address for the crate .
yeah , port of baltimore .
can you get to the docks ?
yeah .
find the trans con warehouse .
the name on the manifest is mason .
sorry , i need this truck .
come on .
shit .
come on !
we' ve come up with an alternative .
we' il counterforce .
a conventional attack on the russian air base ... where the carrier attack originated .
it' s what we' re looking for ... a measured response .
nonnuclear .
is it strong enough ?
smart bombs and f 16s .
pretty goddamn strong .
can' t afford for them to see us as weak .
they' ve gotta know we have the guts to take it to the next level .
i think they' il get that message .
hit ' em .
eagle' s nest , this is eagle one .
we have target acquired .
target is lit .
good bye .
everyone , can i have your attention ?
the generator has gone out .
i don' t want anyone to move because there' s broken glass everywhere .
we' il get back to you ...
good .
okay , stay where you are .
we' re going to get you one by one .
sir , can you hear me ?
can you feel your arms and legs ?
a 9 % iv and morphine drip .
we' re gonna take care of you .
what do you got ?
what do we do with the ones we know won' t make it ?
whatever we can .
what ?
bill cabot died .
i' m really sorry .
this can' t be happening .
sir , you have a call from langley .
thank you .
becker .
this is jack ryan , russian desk .
oh , great .
the nemerov apologist .
sir , this bomb was not nemerov .
i know this guy .
that' s what you said after grozny , mr. ryan .
put it in your report .
the plutonium came from ...
seems unusual to find radiation poisoning all the way out here .
i have never myself seen such a thing .
that is why we published the case on the internet ... to seek help .
how did he say it happened ?
he will not talk about it .
was anyone else exposed to the materials that made you sick ?
mr. ghazi , i' m not the police .
i' m a physician .
anything you say to me stays between us .
my friend and i ... find bomb .
we sell ... to man who buys such things .
was it this man ?
other people may have come in contact with that bomb .
i am ... going to die ... yes ?
yes .
his name ... is olson .
he lives in damascus .
oh , yeah .
we' re getting it all .
mr. president , we need you to initiate snapcount .
what happens then ?
we prepare to take out their land based missiles ... with a massive nuclear strike ... find and kill their subs ... knock out whatever planes they have on the ground ... and mobilize to destroy the ones they already have in the air .
what are our chances ?
david ?
odds are ... we leave nemerov in a pretty pickle .
he' il be left with , at best , a few hundred nukes ... the ones we can' t find .
mostly the smaller , more mobile , less accurate kind .
all he can do with those is target our cities .
but he knows to an absolute certainty ... that we will respond against his cities .
i spent my entire adult life wanting to be president .
this is my presidency .
sir , i believe he' il keep his 300 nukes .
it' s still a credible deterrent against some future aggressor .
he' il push back from the table and call it a night .
i' m giving the order for snapcount .
maximum readiness .
jack , we' re in olson' s files .
he shows wire payments of $45 million from someone named dressler .
dillon , run dressler .
find out who he is .
jack , i want you out of there .
i' m at the docks .
somebody' s here .
try to find the name " dressler .
no !
jack , get out of there .
dillon , call the baltimore pd , give them the address .
hurry .
jack , wait for the cops .
i' il call you back .
wait .
who' s dressler ?
huh ?
where is he , goddamn it ?
where is dressler ?
police !
get your hands up !
where' s dressler ?
are you jack ryan ?
where' s dressler ?
tell me !
let him go .
let him go .
where' s dressler ?
where is he ?
langley said you might need some help .
i gotta get to the pentagon .
i think i can help you with that .
the russians are scrambling their fighters .
we are out of time .
he has a heart condition .
get a doctor .
mr. president .
david , where' s your nitro ?
i said get a doctor in here !
mr. president .
take him to my quarters .
bring him the launch codes .
okay , dressler' s an austrian manufacturer , a billionaire .
his father was executed at nuremberg .
five years ago he bought himself a seat in parliament .
then he got himself booted out for saying nice things about the nazis .
get me the president .
i can' t .
come on !
get me through !
they' re into snapcount .
there' s no way in .
bullshit !
i can do that for you .
no , it' s fine .
got some dirt on the card .
may i see that card , sir ?
we' re on a high alert .
put the card down , please .
back off .
i am ordering you ...
hold on .
take a step back , now !
i am ordering you to take a step back immediately , sir .
general , there' s a dr. ryan from the cla .
he wants to enter nmcc .
he' s unescorted , sir .
what' s he want ?
you , sir .
sir , my name is jack ryan .
i have an urgent message from director cabot ... that i need to transmit over the hot line immediately .
what' s your authorization ?
i don' t have an authorization .
then where' s cabot ?
cabot' s dead , sir .
i just need to get this information sent .
please .
not without authorization .
get him out of here .
wait a minute !
general !
the president' s basing his decisions on some really bad information ... and if you shut me out ... your family and my family and 25 million other families ... will be dead in 30 minutes !
my orders are to get the right information ... to the people who make the decisions .
i just need to send some information .
what makes you think the president will even listen to you ?
he doesn' t have to .
you have about a minute for the launch sequence to process ... after you give the order .
before the order can be taken , an id check must be performed .
mine is the ...
my number is the ... third number down from the top .
your order , sir ?
strike .
i' m sorry , sir ?
i give the order to strike .
under the two man rule , the order to strike must now be confirmed .
bob , for the love of god ...
just do it .
sidney owens , secretary of state .
it' s the fourth number down .
the order to strike has now been confirmed by the two man rule .
nmcc , this is lasseter .
the strike order has been confirmed .
start the sequence .
we' ve got activity on the hot line .
they' ve had their chance .
somebody' s talking to the kremlin .
as you can imagine ... there has been much confusion here ... and fear .
but we know the weapon was not russian .
we know the weapon was not russian .
repeat .
the weapon was not russian .
what the hell is going on ?
who are we talking to ?
ryan .
i met you in moscow with bill cabot .
he died today in baltimore .
cut him off .
we can' t .
launch sequence has begun .
two months ago , a neo fascist named dressler ... bought an a bomb on the black market .
cut him off .
you can' t .
that' s the whole idea .
then get somebody to stop him .
he paid three disaffected russian scientists ...
to make the bomb active .
he shipped it to the us , where a man named mason ... " was hired to deliver the bomb to the target ... and set our countries on a collision course .
what are you asking of me ?
back down .
what guarantee do i have that president fowler will follow suit ?
none .
sir , i know you .
i know you had nothing to do with the baltimore bomb ... and you sure as hell know you didn' t .
but you' re still about to launch a nuclear strike against us .
yes , sir .
it' s no longer about baltimore .
now it' s about our fears .
that' s all , dr. ryan .
move away .
fear of being weak , of mistakes .
fear of the other guy that built these bombs in the first place !
it stopped .
thirty seconds to launch .
oh , my god .
mr. president .
we will maintain our defensive alert for the moment ... but our offensive forces are withdrawn .
if you match our move , i propose a phased mutual stand down ... over the next five hours .
stop the launch sequence .
lasseter here .
flash override .
stop the sequence .
stop the sequence .
order the planes to stand down .
take us to defcon 3 .
and would somebody ask mr. ryan if i can use the phone now ?
you' re still here .
there is no more fitting memorial ... for those who perished in this tragedy ... than the steps we have taken this week ... toward a multinational campaign ... to root out and eliminate weapons of mass destruction .
we embark upon this course ... because we have finally learned , at far too great a cost ... that if the most powerful weapons ever created are unleashed ... they will be fired not in anger , but in fear .
dr. ryan .
mr. grushkov .
it is a lovely day .
yeah .
oh , i' m sorry .
this is ...
dr. muller .
how do you do ?
nice to meet you .
why am i not surprised that you know her name ?
our friend william thought i was a spy .
of course , he could never prove it .
he never told me you were friends .
perhaps he didn' t know you well enough .
cabot did tell me he had a source in russia .
to keep the back channels open ?
in hopes of staving off disaster .
president kennedy said , " our most basic common link ... is that we all inhabit this small planet .
we all breathe the same air .
we all cherish ... our children' s future .
and we are all mortal .
i will miss ... so very much talking to william .
me too .
perhaps ... from time to time ... you and i can talk .
i' d like that .
what is this ?
a modest gift ... for your engagement .
he just asked me this morning .
we haven' t told anybody about ...
how did you ...
how could you possibly know ?
