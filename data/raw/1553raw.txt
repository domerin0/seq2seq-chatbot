what' s the scene like right now ?
all lines have stopped running completely .
no word on their resumption .
have the victims been identified ?
the police are working on it , but none have been made yet .
we first reported that it was 50 highschool girls ... ... who jumped the tracks .
but we' ve since learned it was actually 54 students .
hello ?
anyone there ?
hello ?
hello ?
ms. kawaguchi ?
jiro ?
you scared me .
have you seen akko ?
yes , i have .
she still out ?
i guess so .

i don' t know .
well whatever .
i' il call you when she returns .
thanks .
ms. kawaguchi ?
ms. sawada ?
ms. kawaguchi ?
nurse kawaguchi ?
yoko kawaguchi ?
what an ordeal that turned out to be .
i think the power' s out .
the bakery is closed so i walked all over .
did ms. kawaguchi go home ?
i' m beat .
hey , where' s yoko ?
i think she went home .
oh .
you want her food .
um ... sure .

ah , that feels good .
i' il see you later .
what' re you doing ?
you' ve still got blood on you .
your shoes .
where' s kuroda ?
we' re all here .
listen up .
this was not a crime .
it' s an accident .
stop looking so glum .
they weren' t all from the same high school , were they ?
no , they weren' t .
so far we know it' s 18 schools .
the connection .
it wasn' t a crime .
i' il check it out .
it may have been some sort of cult .
a suicide cult ?
ridiculous .
excuse me .
phone call .
i' d say it' s too much tv , " the pied piper .
shibu here .
it' s bothered me for a while .
what has ?
you know , the suicides .
yeah ... go on ...
you at a computer ?
yes .
i' ve got a web site for you to look at .
hold on .
call everyone .
go ahead .
www . maru ... ... ne .
jp
what is this ?
the red dots ... are women .
the white ones are men .
what' s it mean ?
i had a hunch when i first saw it ... ... but after today , i' m sure of it .
there were 54 new red dots .
there are even more now .
when did you find this ?
when did you find this ?
recently .
it intrigued me .
after those 4 suicides the other day ... ... i saw 4 more dots .
it' s a weird site .
this is all there is .
check out the provider .
tell me what you find , okay ?
i' il do the same .
understood .
and you would be ?
the bat .
no , i mean your real name .
the bat' s fine .
all right , " the bat " it is .
do you have a web site ?
i post on a bbs a lot , look for the bat there .
gotcha .
www . jikennews . com
gotta go now .
wait .
oh yeah , the dots appear before the suicides are reported .
anyway , good luck .
hello ?
hello ?
she hung up .
we' ve got another suicide .
go talk to the witnesses .
jesus !
may 27
yeah , there was a ...
sports bag ?
yes .
it was found on the platform at the time .
yeah , here it is .
could you wait outside for a minute ?
why ?
please .
all right .
knock when you are finished .
same thing .
it may not be the same person , but it' s human skin .
that is certain .
the stitches are the same size .
identical work .
the skin is stitched 10 centimeters apart .
there' s so much of it .
we' re looking at an incredible number of people .
you think they' re different people ?
we' re not sure yet , but we think so .
each piece is different skin .
it' s possible that skin from the same person is repeated somewhere ... ... if it' s like the one found yesterday .
so together , it' s skin from about 200 people then ?
you could say that ... yes .
there are several bodies here .
we' il pry them apart later .
look here .
we won' t know until tomorrow , but we' re sure it' s their skin .
so the other 100 or so skin samples ... ... could be from living people ?
i have no idea ...
i' d prefer it be from corpses , though .
we' d have to check a lot of murder and accident victims .
most have already been cremated .
the remaining 100 are still to come .
that' s totally absurd , impossible .
the tokyo bound train now arriving on track 8 .
for your safety , please stay behind the yellow line .
see you tomorrow .

there .
welcome to my pleasure room .
let' s entertain them .
shut up and listen !
time and time again the sky is blue .
and yet it' s strange how people seem to always fall in love .
an unfamiliar yellow dog ... ... keeps grinning as it tears us from the ones we love .
because the dead ...
because the dead ...
because the dead shine all night long .
i want to die as beautifully as joan of arc ... ... inside a bresson film .
lesson one , apply the shaving cream ... ... and smile as you then slowly slice away the heart .
because the dead ...
because the dead ...
because the dead shine all night long .
feel the warmth of the spring rain as it gently moistens down a cheek ... ... that' s streaked with dried up tears .
a guileless boy but five years old stares blankly in the face of death ... ... while his heart is cut and torn away .
kuroda ...
the tattoo of the 6th chain .
this isn' t suicide .
it' s murder .
tell me .
which is murder , and which isn' t ?

if you die , will you lose the connection with yourself ?
even if you die , your connection with your wife will remain .
so will your connection with your children .
but if you die , will you lose your connection with yourself ?
will you live on ?
are you connected to yourself ?
why couldn' t you feel the pain of others as you would your own ?
why couldn' t you bear the pain of others as you would your own ?

i' ve had delusions of grandeur since i was a child .
may 31
just after 7 this morning ... ... the police arrested a group calling itself the suicide club ... ... and claiming responsibility for multiple murders .
the group used the internet to call upon people to kill themselves .
their proclaimed aim was social upheaval .
investigators are now working to uncover the details .
stand back please , move aside .
am i on camera ?
good , good , good .
first i' d like to say reality is invisible to the naked eye .
you and me both know that life is a real bitch .
bring your best you say ?

it' s like that dessert song .
how' s that go again ?
the world is a jigsaw puzzle .

to open up and feel the brand of life ... ... for each and everyone .
light yourself with life .
light yourself with love .
light yourself with memories .
all it takes is just a little heart and courage on your part .
turn yourself around and take it once again from the start .
though you may feel out of touch at times ...
... or fear a wicked spell has got your life in hand .
if by some chance , you share the feelings that i have for you ... ... come occupy the chasm of my heart .
together we can shed light on the dark .
scary , it' s true .
but we ' il be happy too .
now do you really want to say good bye ...
