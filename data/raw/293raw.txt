police are withholding his name ... ... but we have obtained this photograph ... ... taken after the beating , his face grotesquely bruised and swollen .
it was a bumblebee .
officer rafferty' s vicious beating of a black suspect ... ... has sparked a swift and angry response from the black community .
the police and the district attorney' s office are treating this very seriously .
i urge the people of this city ... ... to please be patient and trust us to do our jobs .
clearly , this is an isolated incident .
it was a bee .

y' all mind if i have a seat ?
cool .
y' all gonna ask a brother questions , don' t even offer me a seat .
what' s happening ?
all right .
while i was being slammed into the car , having billy clubs jammed in my neck ... ... that psychotic storm trooper y' all call a cop ... ... also allowed this big ass bumblebee to nearly sting me to death .
you know what ?
i' m not even sure that bee wasn' t one of his own .
like some anti africanized attack bee , trained to hate black people .
that' s the sort of thing y' all gonna uncover in your investigation ... ... so i ain' t tripping .
would you excuse us for a moment ?
do your thing , man .
thank you .
we can' t put this guy on the stand .
he' s unstable .
not to mention that he  yo .

handsome man .
i don' t believe this .
i' m calling this off .
this is crazy
like it or not , rafferty violated his rights .
people won' t look the other way .
we can' t go through this again .

what' s wrong with this piece of junk ?
i don' t know .
i was gonna take it for a regular maintenance ... ... but for the past six months i' ve been in prison !
you should' ve got more time .
pushing me into cars and putting me in satanic chokeholds .
you were resisting arrest !
i was authorized to use any force
we could go back and forth on this all night long , man .
fortunately , there are courts to handle this matter .
according to the courts ... ... you were assaulting and battering me like a hillbilly on his wife .
yo , yo , yo !
oh , shit .
this is how i' m gonna conceal the weapon .
pull over !
pull over !
get the van !
you pull over , buddy !

lf i would' ve gotten out with a wallet in my hand ... ... l' d have bullets all in my ass !
that' s some bullshit , man .
security guard , huh , hank ?
that' s a shame .
hey , washington , how you doing ?
better than you .
you okay , man ?
you know how it is , my brother .
just a little shaken up , that' s all .
let me see if i got this figured out .
you get out of prison , pissed with your life ... ... you decide to pay your buddy earl a visit .
things got out of hand ... ... shots are fired , police respond just in time to catch hank trying to get ... ... away with you in his car , probably holding you at gunpoint .
am i correct ?
amazing .
you are very , very good .
wait a second .
this is crazy .
i wasn' t out for revenge .
shut the hell up !
just shut the hell up .
i' m tired of your goddamn lies .
i got a restraining order saying you can' t get within 1 00 feet of this guy .
so i don' t really give a damn what you have to say .
all i need from you ... ... is your testimony and his ass goes back to prison .
tomorrow .
nothing would make me happier than to see this man go back to prison .
good .
for the heartache ... ... and the trauma .
one time he took the club and he switched it around ... ... with the handle sticking out and bop , right there .
can you see that little cut , right there ?
anyway ....
what happens is it makes me start saying incoherent ....
you know , i' m liable to spurt that out .
just incoherent shit .
bitch !
i apologize .
my doctor said i' m not getting proper oxygen up through here .
they said pump it and breathe .
and it' s sort of like that sneaker .
it' s a weird exercise .
anyway , nothing would make me happier than to see him go to prison .
wait a second here !
get back , bitch !
shut the hell up , hank , and i mean it !
you the violence .
let me calm myself .
unfortunately , certain details of your story are slightly skewed .
what do you mean , skewed ?
hank ... ... did not come back for revenge .
thank you .
he came back to apologize .
what ?
you went there to apologize ?
the man' s talking to you .
yep .
and you were saying ?
i was ... ... saying i was sorry .
for what ?
beating you .
yeah , my dog .
that' s what i' m talking about , man .
hank was right in the middle of this very touching apology ... ... when i discovered that my warehouse was being robbed .
so hank and i , we banded together to apprehend these outlaws .
and we would' ve had them , had not your boys come along .
excuse me ?
deputy droop a long .
man , they stopped the wrong car .
you better watch your mouth .
what you gonna do ?
beat the hell out of me ?
probably blame it on a damn spider .
what you got ?
the updated report .
we got a 4 59 at the warehouse , but nothing on a van .
coroner has two bodies .
da says self defense .
so we kick them loose .
the c and l warehouse on 1 8th ?
yeah .
not a cop anymore , hank , so stop acting like one .
i' m all too happy to find any reason to lock your ass up .
you understand ?
go find mcduff , tell him i want to see him right away .
yeah , we also encountered a naked girl upstairs , handcuffed to a light fixture .
lola .
do you think you could hook a brother up with another restraining order ?
right there , because i recognize them .
great .
all my stuff should be in here too .
what' s up ?
right .
i don' t believe this .
where' s my bullets ?
we don' t return live ammunition .
well , if you' re gonna keep the bullets , just keep the gun .
all right .
give me my gun , man .
where' s my car ?
lmpound lot .
twenty blocks up , seven blocks over .
you expect that man to walk ....
y' all got a shuttle bus ?
you know what ?
you upset my partner .
i should set it off up in this ....
but you got your boys .
hank , you believe his attitude , man ?
man , they probably gonna give you your car back with no tires .
i like the way you played it back there .
yeah , not letting them in on our case .
that was smooth .
this is our bust , right ?
get the hell away from me !
hey , hank !
you know what ?
sooner or later , your hostility is officially gonna start affecting our work .
now , look , man .
all you got to do is kind of
what is you running for ?
i' m trying to talk to you .
look !
i am trying to remain calm ... ... because if i hit you , i will never see the light of day .
which right now seems almost worth it .
so don' t push it !
you threatening me ?
yeah !
yeah , i' m threatening you !
well , bring it on .
bring it on , hank .
i could have went pro .
i drop bombs on them , drop bombs on them .

oh , bang them out of there .
hey , where you going , man ?

what the problem is ?
hey , man , do i got to solve this crime by myself ?

it' s probably gonna say " big red " all along the side of the truck ... ... in big , red letters .
hey , hank , you know that file back at washington' s office ?
well , i used my acute peripheral vision to get a upside down read .
wanna know what i saw ?

it weighs next to nothing , disperses heat instantaneously ... ... and is resistant to almost any force in man or nature .
well , is it worth anything ?
yeah , millions !

we' re wanted for the shootout on the vincent thomas bridge .
yeah , well , that' s fair .
no , it doesn' t make any sense .
how' d the cops know we were on the bridge ?
only the guys in the truck could ld us , and they wouldn' t call it in .
maybe someone on the inside put out a apb to locate us .
now we' re talking about dirty cops .
what you doing ?
running the numbers on the van .
no , plates are phony .
damn it !
check the vln .
