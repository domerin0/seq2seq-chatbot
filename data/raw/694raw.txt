adam : oh , my god !
all : oh ! charles : jesus christ ! adam : don' t touch her ! don' t touch her ! call 9 1 1 ! don' t move . we were playing . we were playing . i think she' s dead . how do you know she' s dead ? she' s got no fucking pulse !
listen , you don' t know what the hell you' re doing . just get back . all right , where do you look ? what side of the neck ?
left , left , left side . either side , you idiot ! i' m calling 9 1 1 . mike : we were playing , and she bumped her head . bumped ? ! bumped ? ! she' s got a fucking spike in her head ! adam , wait ! what ? boyd : what are you doing ? what do you think you' re doing ? i' m calling the ambulance ! just wait one wait one second . ok ? michael ? michael ? i' il take it out . i can take it out . what the fuck have you done ? ! why are you calling an ambulance ? she' s dead . i' m sorry . sorry . oh , god , just call the police . no . just call 9 1 1 . i slipped . what did you do , goddamn it ? nothing . what the fuck did you do , you little shit ? ! charles : get out of here ! all right , all right , just calm down . mike : it was an accident ! boyd : everybody just get a hold of themselves , all right ? you are a lying deviant ! it was an accident ! are you sure yes , i' m sure ! what were you doing ? the floor was wet , and so i slipped . why was the floor wet ? ! i don' t know . why , goddamn it ? ! why , you little fucking pervert ? ! boyd : come on , damn it , take it easy . you don' t fucking know ! calm down . we' re not helping anything by losing our temper . boyd : let' s just get our heads together . ok ? whatever we associate in our nervous system determines our behavior . you fucking guys . you fucking guys . you fucking guys . kyle : you fucking guys ! boyd : now let' s just take a second here , and take a hold of the situation and review our options . we call the police ! ok , call the police , that' s good . that' s one option . that is not an option ! this is not multiple choice here . yes , it is ! there are always options , adam . kyle : you fucking guys ! boyd : we can definitely call the police . that' s an easy call . now , if we call the police , what happens ? they come up here , they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom , and then they ask us what happened . what the hell are you going to tell them ? you had nothing to do with it ? you didn' t know she was a prostitute ? i mean , that it was all michael here ? your brother , by the way . you don' t mess around with a homicide ... what about the alcohol , narcotics ... don' t tell me there are no options . there are always fucking options . what is the choice ? what options ?
we can bury her out in the desert . oh , sure , why not ? charles : no , no , he' s right , he' s right . he' s right . he' s right . boyd : we could take her up to red rock . find some nice quiet place and just put her in the ground . we can do this . we can get her out of here . have you lost your fucking mind ? nobody knows she' s here . i called her personally . nobody knows . her blood is all over the bathroom . don' t you think we got a little bit of a dna problem here ? it' s a marble floor . we can clean it up . they' ve got us on accessory to murder , adam . it' s not accessory , ok ? i didn' t do shit . that' s not the point , adam . i mean , the room is covered with blow , moore looks like he went at it with a fucking mountain lion . i mean , the room looks like the manson family stayed here a month . this is a major thin ice situation we got here . i' m getting married , guys . adam : i have got a wife , and i' ve got two boys , ok ? don' t tell me .
let' s just take a vote , a simple vote . we got two choices : one , we clean up this mess right now , bury it out in the desert , go home , and never look back . or , we can easily call the police , roll the dice , take our chances , and pray to god that it' s only michael who falls . the choices are simple : it' s desert or police .
desert .
the fucking desert . uh uh . fish , i owe you , bro . i owe you , man .
desert .
nobody knows she' s here . oh , god ... oh , god .
how do we get her out of here ?
we can wrap her up in blankets , bring the car around to the back of the hotel ,
lower her gently down off the balcony , put her in the car . we' re done . jesus christ , have you done this before ?
the reality is , you take away the horror of the situation , take away the tragedy of the death , take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap that you' ve had conditioned and beaten into your head since grade one , what are we left with ? what ? it' s a 105 pound problem .
105 pounds that' s got to be moved from point " a " to point " b . " now , a straight line is the shortest distance between two points , but we' re denied the luxury of a visible straight line , but that line exists , and i see it . i see that line . trust me . adam , trust me .
man : hotel security . could you please open the door ? oh , fuck .
man : hello ? hotel security .
what do they want ?
shit .
oh , fuck . they know . calm down . man : hello ? adam : goddamn it , they know ! tell them right now ! boyd : just keep your voice down .
they have cameras in the ceiling . shut up ! boyd : shh shh . we don' t have time . shut up . shut up . shh .
he' s gone .
boyd : he' s gone .

it' s a bachelor party . well , y' all going to have to keep it down . boyd : well , we will . we will . we absolutely will .
listen , we' re very , very sorry , we apologize . we' ve been partying a little hard , but we' re all getting ready to go to sleep .
guard : mmm mmm .
well , this is going to be a problem . someone' s going to have to pay . yeah , we' re going to take care of that first thing in the morning . yeah , you will . what the hell gets into you people ? drugs and alcohol .
well , i got no problem with that .
dr . bigbucks .
adam : hey , how about a beer ? no . maybe some other time .
listen , we' re very , very sorry , we apologize . we didn' t mean any disrespect to the hotel . we' re very sorry . hey , hey , don' t worry about it . don' t worry about it at all . just as long as you keep it down .
what the fuck is that ?
adam : sir , please , before you go in there , i just want to explain . can i talk to you one second , please ? d d don' t go in there yet . we were calling 9 1 1 right when you came , i swear to god . this is not what it looks like .
adam : go in there and put your fucking pants on . mike : i' m not going to put my pants back on . no , you get dressed . goddamn it , i' il handle this . just get back . just get back . everybody just get just move back . mike : the floor was wet . she completely slipped . guard : get me a phone . just get me a telephone . back up , back up ! he wants us to back up . guard : i want everybody just to move back . just take your fucking hands off me !
guard : clear a path !
boyd : don' t let him bleed on the carpet ! go on ! get out ! get out !
shut the door !
boyd : come over here ! help me ! jesus ! oh , shit ! son of a bitch ! boyd : he' il bleed out . he' il bleed out ! oh , my god ! guard : you motherfuckers ! boyd : all right , he' il bleed out . he' il bleed out .
oh , die !
die ! die , you son of a bitch !
it' s all right .
come on .
come on .
bingo .
new plan .
no , no , not so much of a new plan as a modification on the old one . i' m calling the police . so help me god , you touch that fucking phone , i' il bury you with them . surrender is no longer an option . i repeat , it is not an option . is there anyone here who does not understand that ?
little gut check time , fellas . time for some serious self exploration . how do i function ? for real , no more bullshit . can i keep my cool when they bounce my bananas , when they won' t play my song , et cetera , et cetera ? you get me ? do you get me ? not really , no . that' s not a problem . understand not my words , but follow my orders . follow my orders .
let me be the success coach .
wait a minute . wait a minute . wait , wait , wait , wait . boyd : what ? we can' t do this . we' ve already done this . no , no , i mean the suitcases . we can' t bury them like this in the suitcases . why not ? because it' s sacrilegious . how do you figure ? according to jewish law , the blood and the limbs are considered to be a sacred part of the human spirit . the body has to be united , or the soul can' t rest in peace . what the hell ? that' s what we' re doing . no , no , it' s not . we got their parts all mixed together . we can' t do this to them . she' s asian . they don' t have jews in asia . that is absolutely not true . michael , do they have jews in asia ? huh ? they have yes , they do . they have jews in asia . he is correct . what the fuck are we supposed to do ?
we' re going to have to open up the suitcases . we' re going to unpack the bodies and reunite the appropriate limbs . no fucking way ! that' s what we' re going to do ! no fucking way ! we have to do this , goddamn it ! adam , we got to get going . the sun' s coming up . come on ! i am not flexible on this .
let' s do it .
i' ve got her head .
adam : this is her head . i got a combo situation . do you have any of him ? i have that' s her .
boyd : watch your step , all right . hey ! hey !
i' ve got a mop . kyle : just open the fucking bags up ! adam , heads up . jesus christ ! mike : don' t just toss it around , goddamn it ! show a little fucking respect ! i have her lower leg . ok , i have his upper leg and her lower leg . i have his upper leg and her lower ,
leg and they don' t go together ! boyd : how do we get started , adam ?
look , if you don' t want to do it , just sit the fuck down ! great fucking idea ! everybody' s losing their goddamned minds ! is this her stuff here ? that' s her ! that' s him ! all right , let' s do this . boyd : all right , somebody get his torso , find his torso . forget the head , we' il just start . mike : we got the head . boyd : we' il start with black , then we' il go to the asian , all right ? we' re going to make you very happy . ok , you don' t do nothing . i got toes ! ok , relax . i got toes . i have somebody' s toes .
boyd : ok ?
all right .
allow me to be the first to say that what we have done here is not a good thing . it' s clearly not a good thing , but it was , given the circumstances , the smart play .
i' m proud of us .
i am proud of each and every one of us . it' s going to be ok .
we performed under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations . i mean , each one of us stood fast , and we all delivered . i feel proud . we' re going to hell ... hell or prison , whichever comes first . that' s wrong . that is flat out wrong , adam . you got to change your associations . hell is for cowards , for hypocrites , for people who fear to live by the strength of their own conviction . now , this is war ! given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not , we' ve all chosen life over death . i mean , two wrongs don' t make a right , so our conviction and execution would only mean more death here , not less . i don' t know , boyd . just seems to me ever since you started this personal growth , self help , power fucking dysfunctional fucking bullshit , you are all fucked up in the head ! don' t even go there . you don' t know what the hell you' re talking about , all right ? personal strength has nothing to do with this . true , it' s helped me to unlock energies and see my options more clearly , but to give it credit for all of this is a little bit more than they deserve .
kyle : don' t you think we ought to say some words over the bodies ? what kind of words ?
like a ... a prayer .
go ahead .
dear god ...
i don' t fucking know how to pray . say what' s on your mind . speak from the heart .
let it flow .
dear god ... this is pathetic . you' re pathetic . what did you say ? you' re not a team player . don' t point at me . you' ve never been a team player . that' s why you don' t have any friends . what are you talking about ? i have friends . the hell you do . the hell i don' t . you have acquaintances . business friends , superficial golf buddies . you' ve always been a fringe player . don' t point at me . you have some serious male on male intimacy problems . what are you fucking talking about ? you can' t deal with men ! guys , maybe now is not the time for this . come on , fisher , this is the perfect time . this is the real time . we' re in the moment . adam , your brother and myself as well as several others present have always felt that you were a fully repressed , living in major denial , lock down flyboy .
what ? fire in the hole , big guy . what ? dear god , please forgive us for what we' ve done here tonight . we' ve lost our way . speaking for myself , i am deeply in love with the woman i' m about to marry , and i am very much looking forward to raising a family and being a positive member of society . we promise , if you forgive us , that we will never forget this tragedy and we will try with all our power to use it as a daily reminder that we are on this earth to do good , not evil .
let us move from this day forward with new spirit and purpose . you have given us a second chance , so let us take that second chance and use it to fuel our fires of productivity so that the spirits of the two people that we buried here tonight can forever live on in our good deeds and positive achievements that we , from this day forward , shall make our lives ' work . thank you , god , and once again , please give us your guidance and your forgiveness . amen .

michael was in love with lois . that' s what michael and adam were arguing about in the parking lot . michael killed adam in a jealous rage ,
lois rejected michael , he strangled her to death ... and he shot himself in the head . happens all the time .
that lois , she fought like a fucking comanche .
man : well , i don' t see how this could have been kept from you .
last month , adam and lois changed their will . they requested that you two , as a married couple , be custodians of record for their estate , including all properties , cash holdings , security holdings , and ... children . adam had a $500, 000 term life insurance policy . what does that mean ? that means we have $500, 000 to help raise the kids . no ! yes . no ! yes . actually , no . adam failed to make his last payment , so his term life lapsed . but he did have a pension account worth $150, 000 and the house , valued at 350, 000 . ok , so where does that leave us ?
150 and 350 , that takes us back up to 500, 000 . not even close . the property value' s down . the house is worth 100, 000 less ... 3 credit cards ... the minivan payments ... and the income and the state taxes assessed on his i . r . a ... that leaves you in the neighborhood of ... $14, 223 . are you fucking kidding me ?

what are you talking about ? in vegas . michael killed a woman . michael killed her he hit her head and she bled . and she ... she died . but there was nothing we could do about it , so we buried her . who' s dead ? the prostitute' s dead . you fucked a prostitute ? no . michael did . it was an accident , michael did it . where is she ? she' s buried in the desert . you left a dead prostitute alone in the desert ? she' s not alone . boyd went boyd went crazy . he went nuts , and he started killing everybody . he killed a guard . he killed michael . he killed lois stop , ok ? just stop right there . i don' t want to hear any more of this , ok ? i told you not to do that stupid fucking bachelor party thing . i know . you were warned ! i know . you were warned , kyle ! you were warned ! i told you your friends were just jackasses ! i know ! and i' m sorry . i' ve waited 27 years , ok ?
