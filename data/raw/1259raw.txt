this better not be a joke .
this ain' t a joke .
i' m in .
i' m up his ass .
nice guy eddie tells me joe wants to meet me .
he says i should just wait for a phone call .
after waiting three days he calls me last night and says joe' s ready .
he' il pick me up in 15 minutes .
who picked you up ?
nice guy .
we get to a bar .
what bar ?
smokey pete' s in gardena .
we get there ... and i meet joe and a guy named mr. white .
phony name .
my name' s mr. orange .
mr. orange ?
mr. orange .
okay , mr. orange .
you ever see this motherfucker before ?
who ?
mr. white ?
yes .
mr. white .
no .
he ain' t one of cabot' s men either .
he' s gotta be from out of town .
joe knows him good .
how can you tell ?
the way they talk .
you can tell they' re buddies .
you two talk ?
me and joe ?
mr. white .
a little .
about what ?
the brewers .
milwaukee brewers ?
they won the night before .
he made some money off them .
good .
if this crook' s a brewers fan , he' s gotta be from wisconsin .
and i' il bet you everything ... they got a sheet in milwaukee on this mr. white' s ass .
so i want you to go through everybody in milwaukee ... with a history of armed robbery and put a name to the face .
nice work , freddy .
thank you , my man .
how was long beach mike' s referral ?
perfect .
his backing me up went a long way .
i told them i played poker with him .
nice guy checked it out and said it was a okay .
said i was a good thief , i didn' t rattle ... and that i was ready to move .
he' s a good guy .
i wouldn' t be inside without him .
long beach mike is not your friend .
long beach mike is a fucking scumbag .
he' s selling out his friends .
that' s how nice he fuckin ' is .
i' il take care of his ass ... but you get that scumbag out of mind and take care of business .
gone .
use the commode story ?
what' s the commode story ?
it' s a scene .
memorize it .
a what ?
undercover cops gotta be brando .
to do this job you gotta be a great actor , naturalistic .
you gotta be naturalistic as hell .
if you' re a bad actor , that' s bullshit in this job .
what is this ?
that' s an amusing anecdote about a drug deal .
something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job .
i gotta memorize all this ?
there' s four pages of this shit .
think about it like it' s a joke .
memorize what' s important .
the rest you make your own .
you can tell a joke , can' t you ?
well , pretend you' re don rickles ... and tell a joke , all right ?
the things you gotta remember are the details .
the details sell your story .
this particular story takes place in a men' s room .
you gotta know all the details ... whether they got paper towels or a blower to dry your hands .
you gotta know if the stalls ain' t got no doors or not .
you gotta know if they got liquid soap or that pink , granulated shit ... they used in high school .
you gotta know if they got hot water or not , if it stinks ... if some nasty , lowlife , scum ridden motherfucker ... sprayed diarrhea all over one of the bowls .
you gotta know every detail there is to know about this commode .
what you gotta do is take all them details and make ' em your own .
while you' re doing that , remember that this story is about you ... and how you perceived the events that went down .
the only way to do that ... is keep sayin ' it ... and sayin ' it and sayin ' it .
this is during the l. a. marijuana drought , 1986 .
i still had a connection , which was insane ' cause ... you couldn' t get any weed anywhere then .
anyway , i had a connection with this hippie chick in santa cruz ... and all my friends knew it .
they call me and say , " hey , freddy ...
i say , " hey , dude .
you gettin ' some ?
can you get some for me too ?
they knew i still smoked , so they asked me to buy some for them .
it got to be ...
every time i bought some weed i was buyin ' for four or five people .
finally i said , fuck this shit .
i' m makin ' this bitch rich .
she didn' t even have to meet these people .
i was doing all the work .
that got to be a pain in the ass , people calling all the time .
i couldn' t even rent a tape without six fuckin ' interruptions .
when' s the next time you' re gettin ' some ?
motherfucker , i' m tryin ' to watch the lost boys .
when i get some , i' il call you .
then these rink a dink potheads come by .
they' re my friends and everything , but still ...
i got it laid out in 60 dollar bags , they don' t want 60 dollars worth .
they want ten dollars ' worth , and breaking it up wasn' t easy .
i don' t even know what ten dollars ' worth looks like .
this was a very weird situation .
remember back in ' 86 ... there was a major fuckin ' drought .
nobody had anything .
people were livin ' on resin , smokin ' the wood in their pipes .
this chick had a bunch and she' s beggin ' me to sell it .
so i told her i wasn' t gonna be joe the pot man anymore ... but i would take a little bit and sell it to my close friends .
she agreed and we kept the same arrangement as before ... ten percent and free pot for me ... if i helped her that weekend .
she was sellin ' a brick of weed and didn' t wanna go to the buy alone .
her brother usually goes with her , but he' s in county unexpectedly .
what for ?
his traffic tickets gone to warrant .
they stopped him , found warrants on him , took him to county .
she doesn' t wanna walk around alone with all that weed .
i don' t wanna do this .
i have a very bad feeling about it .
she keeps asking me , asking me .
finally i said okay ' cause i' m sick of hearing it .
so we go to the train station ...
wait .
you' re goin ' to the train station with the weed on ya ?
the guy needed it right away .
anyway , we get to the train station ... and we' re waitin ' for the guy .
i' m carryin ' the weed in a carry on bag .
i gotta take a piss , so i tell her i' m goin ' to the boy' s room .
so i walk into the men' s room and who' s standing there ?
four los angeles county sheriffs and a german shepherd .
they' re waitin ' for you ?
no , they' re just talkin ' .
when i walked in , they all stopped talkin ' ... and they looked at me .
that' s hard .
that' s a fuckin ' hard situation .
german shepherd starts barking .
he' s barkin ' at me .
i mean , it' s obvious he' s barkin ' at me .
take off , man .
just bail .
get the fuck outta there .
panic hits me like a bucket of water .
bam !
right in the face .
i' m drenched in panic and these cops are lookin ' at me and they know it .
they can smell it , sure as that fuckin ' dog can .
they can smell it on me .
shut up .
so anyway , i got my gun drawn .
i point it at this guy and i tell him ...
freeze .
don' t fuckin ' move .
this little idiot' s looking right at me and saying ...
i know , i know .
but meanwhile his right hand is creepin ' toward the glove box .
i scream at him , " asshole !
i' m gonna blow you away right now !
put your hands on the dash .
he' s still looking at me , nodding his head .
i know , buddy , i know .
meanwhile his hand is still going for the glove box .
and i said ...
buddy , i' m gonna shoot you in the face ... if you don' t put your hands up .
chuck , what are you doin ' ?
listen to the officer !
put your hands on the dash !
so then the guy snaps out of it and puts his hands on the dash .
what was he goin ' for ?
his fucking registration .
you' re kidding .
no , man !
stupid citizen doesn' t know how close he came to gettin ' blown away .
that close , man .
you knew how to handle that situation .
you shit your pants , dive in and swim .
tell me more about cabot .
i don' t know .
he' s a cool guy .
he' s funny .
he' s a funny guy .
you remember the fantastic four ?
yeah , with that invisible bitch ... and " flame on " and shit , right ?
thing .
motherfucker ...
looks just like the thing .
hey !
showtime !
grab your jacket .
i' m parked outside .
i' il be right down .
he' il be right down .
don' t pussy out on me now .
they don' t know .
they don' t know shit .
you' re not gonna get hurt .
you' re fuckin ' baretta .
they believe every fuckin ' word ' cause you' re super cool .
there goes our boy .
the guy has to have rocks in his head the size of gibraltar ... to work undercover .
you want one of these ?
yeah , give me the bear claw .
i know what i' m talking about .
black women ain' t the same as white women .
there' s a slight difference .
very funny .
you know what i mean .
what a white bitch will put up with , a black bitch wouldn' t for a minute .
if you cross their line , they fuck you up .
i gotta go along with pink on that .
okay , mr. expert , if this is such a truism ... why is it that every nigger i know treats his woman like a piece of shit ?
i' il bet those same niggers who show their ass in public ... when their bitches get ' em home they chill the fuck out .
not these guys .
oh , yeah .
those guys too .
tell you guys a story .
in one of daddy' s clubs there' s a black cocktail waitress named elois .
elois ?
yeah , elois .
e and lois .
we called her lady e.
where was she from ?
compton ?
she' s from ladora heights .
ladora heights .
the black beverly hills .
it' s not the black beverly hills .
it' s the black palos verdes .
anyway ...
lady e , she was a man eater upper .
un fuckin ' believable .
every guy who ever saw her had to jack off to her at least once .
you know who she looked like ?
christie love .
remember that tv show get christie love ... about the black female cop ?
she always used to say , " you' re under arrest , sugar !
who played christie love ?
pam grier .
no , it wasn' t pam grier .
pam grier was the other one .
pam grier did the film .
christie love was like a pam grier tv show without pam grier .
so , who was christie love ?
how should i know ?
great .
now i' m totally fuckin ' tortured .
whoever it was , she looked exactly like elois .
anne francis .
no .
that was honey west .
anne francis is white .
i' m tryin ' to tell a story here .
she looked exactly like elois .
we come into the club one night ... and there' s carlos , the bartender .
he' s a wetback .
he' s a friend of mine .
i says to him , " carlos , where' s lady e tonight ?
apparently lady e ... was married to real piece of dog shit , a real animal .
he used to do things to her .
like what ?
what would he do ?
beat her up ?
i don' t know .
he just did things .
so anyway , one night she plays it real cool .
she waits for him to get drunk .
he falls asleep on the fuckin ' couch .
she sneaks up on him , puts some glue on his dick ... and glues his dick to his belly .
jesus christ !
i' m serious , man .
i' m dead serious .
they had to call the paramedics to cut the prick loose .
was he all pissed off ?
how would you feel if you had to do a fuckin ' handstand to take a piss ?
you guys like to tell jokes and giggle and kid around , huh ?
giggling like a bunch of girls in the schoolyard .
well , let me tell a joke .
five guys sittin ' in a bullpen ...
san quentin ... wonderin ' how the fuck they got there .
what did we do wrong ?
what shouldn' t we have done ?
it' s your fault , his fault ...
all that bullshit .
finally somebody says ...
wait a minute .
while we were planning this caper ... we just sat around tellin ' fuckin ' jokes .
got the message ?
i don' t mean to holler at ya .
when this caper' s over , and i' m sure it' il be successful ... we' il go down to hawaiian islands , i' il laugh with all of youse .
find me a different character down there .
right now it' s a matter of business .
with the exception of eddie and myself ... who you already know ... we' re gonna be using aliases on this job .
under no circumstances ... do we want any one of you to relate to each other ... by your christian names .
and i don' t want any talk about yourself personally .
that includes where you been , your wife' s name ... where you might' ve done time ... or a bank maybe you robbed in st. petersburg .
all i want you guys to talk about , if you have to ... is what you' re gonna do .
that should do it .
these are your names ...
mr. brown , mr. white ...
mr. blonde , mr. blue ...
mr. orange and mr. pink .
why am i mr. pink ?
because you' re a faggot !
all right ?
why can' t we pick our own colors ?
no way .
no way .
tried it once .
it doesn' t work .
you get four guys all fightin ' over who gets to be mr. black .
they don' t know each other , so nobody wants to back down .
no way .
i pick .
you' re mr. pink .
be thankful you' re not mr. yellow .
but mr. brown , that' s too close to mr. shit .
mr. pink sounds like mr. pussy .
how about mr. purple ?
that' s sounds good .
i' il be mr. purple .
you' re not mr. purple .
some guy on some other job is mr. purple .
you' re mr. pink !
who cares what your name is ?
easy for you to say .
you' re mr. white .
you have a cool sounding name .
if it' s no big deal to be mr. pink , you wanna trade ?
nobody' s tradin ' with anybody .
this ain' t a goddamn fuckin ' city council meeting , you know .
now listen up , mr. pink .
there' s two ways you can go on this job ... my way or the highway .
what' s it gonna be , mr. pink ?
jesus christ , joe .
fuckin ' forget about it .
it' s beneath me .
i' m mr. pink .
let' s move on .
i' il move on when i feel like it .
do all you guys got the goddamn message ?
i' m so goddamn mad hollerin ' at you guys , i can hardly talk .
let' s go to work .
let' s go over it .
where are you ?
i stand outside and guard the door .
i don' t let anybody go in or out .
mr. brown .
he waits in the car .
i give him the signal , he pulls up in front .
mr. blonde and mr. blue .
crowd control .
they handle the customers and the employees .
that girl' s ass .
sittin ' right here on my dick .
myself and mr. pink ?
you two take the manager and make him give you the diamonds .
we' re there for those stones , period .
since no display cases are being fucked with , no alarms should go off .
we' re out in two minutes , not one second longer .
what if the manager won' t give you the diamonds ?
a store like this is insured up the ass .
they' re not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever .
if you get a customer or an employee who thinks he' s charles bronson ... smash their nose with your gun .
drops him right to the floor .
everyone jumps .
he falls down screaming , blood squirts out of his nose .
freaks everybody out .
nobody says fuckin ' shit after that .
some bitch might talk shit to you .
give her a look like she' s next .
watch her shut the fuck up .
if it' s the manager , that' s different .
the managers know not to fuck around ... so if he' s giving you static ... he probably thinks he' s a real cowboy so you gotta that bastard in two .
if he won' t tell ya something , cut off one of his fingers .
the little one .
then tell him his thumb' s next .
after that he' il tell you if he wears ladies underwear .
i' m hungry .
let' s get a taco .
fuck .
jesus .
i' m blind , man .
i' m fuckin ' blind .
no , you just got blood in your eyes .
is he dead ?
did he die or not ?
let' s go .
hold it !
get out !
get out of the fuckin ' car !
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , larry .
i can' t believe she killed me .
who' d have fucking thought that ?
hey , just cancel that shit right now .
you' re hurt .
you' re hurt real fuckin ' bad .
but you ain' t dying .
all this blood' s scaring the shit out of me , larry .
i' m gonna die .
i know it .
what the fuck happened ?
he slashed the cop' s face , cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive .
what ?
i didn' t hear you .
i said ...
blonde went crazy .
he slashed the cop' s face , cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive .
this cop ?
he went crazy ?
something like that ?
worse or better ?
eddie , he was pulling a burn , man .
he was gonna kill the cop and me .
when you guys walked in , he was gonna kill you and run with the diamonds .
what' d i tell ya ?
that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho .
you should' ve asked the cop , not just killed him .
he talked about what he was gonna do when he was slicing him up .
i don' t buy it .
doesn' t make sense .
makes perfect fuckin ' sense to me .
you didn' t see how he acted during the job .
we did .
he' s right .
the ear' s hacked off .
let me just say this out loud , ' cause i wanna get this straight .
you' re saying that mr. blonde ... was gonna kill you ... and then when we got back he was gonna kill us ... take the diamonds and scram .
i' m right about that , right ?
that' s your story ?
i swear on my mother' s soul ... that' s what happened .
the man you killed just got released from prison .
he got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items .
he could' ve fuckin ' walked .
all he had to do was say my dad' s name , but he didn' t ; he kept his mouth shut .
he did his fuckin ' time like a man .
he did four years for us .
so , mr. orange ... you' re telling me that this good friend of mine ... who did four years for my father ... who , in four years , never made a deal , no matter what they offered him ... you' re telling me that now that he' s free ... and we' re making good on our commitment to him ... he' s just gonna decide , out of the fucking blue ... to rip us off ?
why don' t you tell me what really happened .
what the hell for ?
it' d just be more bullshit .
this man set us up .
dad , i' m sorry , but i don' t know what' s happening .
it' s all right .
i do .
what are you talking about ?
that lump of shit' s workin ' with the l. a. p. d.
i don' t have the slightest fucking idea ... what you' re talking about .
joe , i don' t know what you think you know , but you' re wrong .
like hell i am .
trust me on this .
you' ve made a mistake .
he' s a good kid .
i understand you' re super fuckin ' pissed .
we' re all real emotional .
but you' re barking up the wrong tree .
i know him .
he wouldn' t do that .
you don' t know jack shit !
i do .
the cocksucker tipped off the cops ... and got mr. brown and mr. blue killed .
mr. blue is dead ?
dead as dillinger .
how do you know all this ?
he was the only one i wasn' t 100 percent on .
i should have my head examined , going ahead when i wasn' t 100 percent .
that' s your proof ?
with instinct , you don' t need proof .
i ignored it before , but no more .
have you lost your fuckin ' mind ?
i' m not gonna let you make a terrible mistake .
come on , guys .
nobody wants this .
we' re supposed to be fuckin ' professionals .
larry , look ... it' s been quite a long time .
a lot of jobs .
there' s no need for this , man .
let' s just put our guns down ... and let' s settle this ... with a fucking conversation .
joe , if you kill that man , you die next .
repeat : you kill him , you die next .
larry , we have been friends .
you respect my dad and i respect you ... but i' il put bullets in you .
you put that fuckin ' gun down now .
goddamn you , joe ... don' t make me do this .
larry , you stop pointin ' that gun at my dad !
i' m sorry , kid .
looks like we' re gonna ... do a little time .
i' m a cop .
larry ...
i' m sorry .
i' m ... so sorry .
i' m a cop .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m ... sorr ...
freeze !
drop the fucking gun , buddy !
now !
put the gun down !
don' t do it !
drop the gun , man !
drop the fucking gun !
we' re gonna blow you away !
