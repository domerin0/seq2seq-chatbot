this gentleman , however , will need surgery .

it' s not a big deal .
at worst , you' d lose a toe .

i' il be right back .
are you sure about this ?
we' ve got the fbi on us like trailer trash on velveeta .

the bunion ... what ?

gives you a hell of a kick .
people say they wake up so refreshed .

it' s not like we' re going to the bahamas or anything .
i mean , this is official business .

oh , no .
this is about the tax return , isn' t it ?
you ever been to france , jer ?
no .
i think we' re flying way too low .
well , we gotta stay under the radar .
it makes things a little less complicated .
yeah , but this is just too low .
let me tell you about this guy we' re gonna see .
his name is jean pierre thibodoux .
now , he is a smuggler of the worst kind .
but not to worry , all right ?
we' re just going in and out .
gotta pick up $ 170 million .
hopefully broker a deal where i can bust both the buyer and seller , put them in jail .
you' re getting $ 170 million ?
yeah .
it' s chump change for a guy like that .
once he' s got olga ... ... he can control the black market in the u . s . , russia and the middle east .
so everybody wants this olga .
oh , my god .
oh , no .
what' s this shaking ?
what is that ?
that' s too much !
oh , jer ... ... do you know anything about flying a g5 ?
that' s not funny !
i' m serious , jer .
there' s something wrong here .
what are you doing ?
why are you banging that ?
do you know how you put the landing gear down in this ?
you don' t know where the landing gear is ?
how can you not know that ? !
i got you so good , didn' t i , jer ?
you son of a ...
my husband couldn' t possibly be buying a ...
could you please repeat that ?
a stealth nuclear submarine .
missing since 1998 . the commander of the fleet , one alexei cherkasov ... ... now a kingpin with the russian mob , has been selling stolen military equipment .
this is his big ticket item .
and we found a sample ... ... of her fissile nuclear waste in your husband' s possession .
fissile nuclear what ?
each submarine emits a kind of radioactive waste ... ... which bears a unique imprint to that particular sub .
a proof of possession .
you guys , my dad wouldn' t buy a russian sub .
i mean , he won' t even buy a foreign car .
place is clean .
thank you .
we' il be in touch .
guys , let' s go .
when i opened the door , i thought they were strippers .
so i' m in france because of submarine piss .
yeah , it' s nutty , isn' t it ?
think what you' il tell your grandchildren .
of course , you' re gonna be sworn to secrecy , so you won' t be able to , but ... who are these guys ?
hi , how are you ?
nice hair .
i don' t understand something !
why would a smuggler want a ... ?
large , armed , virtually undetectable transport vehicle ?
right .
so he moves drugs , munitions , everything .
world falls apart , this guy makes a fortune .
i see a lot of guns .
did you ever think it' s because you want to see the guns ?
i mean , i look around , i see birds , flowers , beautiful girls .
the cup is half full .
you know , you gotta stop , smell the roses .
arms up .
please be careful .
i have very sensitive underarms .
i just don' t ...
i' m not kidding .
don' t do that , please .
please !
fanny pack ?
by the way , this fanny pack comes from france .
take a good look , boys .
i' ve been known to shoot tranq darts from my knees .
look at you .
you' re just an old guy pretending to be a little kid .
knee brace .
the brace is for getting through metal detectors .
distracts them from the knife in my shoe .
steven !
jean pierre .
come on .
one little thing i almost forgot .
i' ve been known to travel with some dangerous types ... ... so he might think that you' re an arms dealer or a deadly assassin .
so you just play along with it , okay ?
what ?
just play along at being a deadly ... silent , but deadly .
we must hold our introduction .
please , gentlemen , walk with me .
this man was caught stealing from me .
were this one year ago , i would torture him to death .
but i have made some personal growth .
you notice it , right ?
i noticed right off the bat , jean pierre .
well , i' m calmer now .
i am more centered .
i spent some time with deepak chopra .
he wrote molecules of emotion and natural healing for anxiety and depression .
i have learned how to forgive .
run for your life !
i know i need to do more work on myself .
you' re doing great , j . p .

i would love nothing more than to share a drink with the legendary fat cobra .
those mosquitoes are bad this time of year .
so you' re buying a submarine .
well , that' il be nice .
wonderful .
now i can take anything anywhere .
cocaine , nuclear devices .
whatever you want , i will move it .
that' s terrific .

we' re gonna lay here together .
thank you .
to fat cobra ... ... in the flesh .
so tell me ... ... how many kills do you have ?

they don' t know the joy of holding a man' s beating heart in the palm of your hand .
that' s a good feeling .
let' s take a walk .

i' il be right back .
i' m going to kill you !
kill you !
that' s great !
great , jerry .
you' re getting into character .

did you hear what he' s calling me ?
did you hear that ?
fat cobra !
listen ... ... i have to talk to you .
hey !
i can' t go in with you , but i' m happy to watch .
why ?
i have , like , a childhood problem .
a disease .
sort of rare .
i' m not waterproof .
my skin will let in water .
so i can' t be in a situation where ... ... i submerse myself .
so as a child , i couldn' t do anything .
i couldn' t even play with a hose .
you know , the slip ' n slides ?
yes .
i couldn' t have that .
and even snow cones .
anyway , if i got in there and it happened , then i could really get sick .
what would happen is the water goes all the way through the skin ... ... because i got what they ... well , they call " wet bone .
i' m curious to know more about wet bone .
well , the money' s all there , huh ?

you' re looking a little dizzy .

well , my wife is still very much alive .
it' s very nice to have a wife .
but as a man , there are certain things i can only do with other men .
like golf ?

it' s just occasionally i need the company of a man .
just because i' m big , it doesn' t mean i' m easy .

we' ve changed the location of the rehearsal dinner .
we' re gonna meet you at the signature room ... ... at the hancock tower instead of the marriott .
you moved the rehearsal dinner ?
well , the hancock tower owed us a favor and they' il set us up really nice .
so if you get there before i do and there' s any kind of problem , ask for artie .
reference the alabaster incident .
he' il know what you' re talking about .
oh , my god .
i' m sorry about this , buddy , but it' s important .
and this isn' t ?
you gotta trust me on this , all right ?
have i ever let you down ?

i know all about you now .
you' re a liar .
you lie about everything .
i did not lie to you , jer .
i do not lie to family .
don' t call me family !
we' re not family !
he did what ?
it' s fine .
he switches things around sometimes ... how could he just go and do that ?
because he' s steve tobias .
and steve tobias is an emotional fascist .
but i' d like to say something .
just because i hate marc' s father ... ... it' s not going to be uncomfortable here at the wedding .
hello , everyone !
hi , mom .
hi , honey .
i' m so happy to be here .
and i' m so proud of you .
and finally , the daughter i never had .

what happened to the marriott ?
it' s closer to the ground .
come on .
the signature room .
i' ve always wanted to come here , but jerry gets vertigo .
thank you so much for the surprise .
this would be steve' s doing .
he doesn' t have a soul ... ... so he has to compensate by making extravagant gestures .
well , marriage is difficult .
but we had fantastic sex .
fantastic , angry ... ... crazy , crazy , crazy sex .
hey .
we' re here .
oh , my god .
your dad must sell a lot of toner .

let' s not .
why do you enjoy moving rehearsal dinners and having everyone hate you ?
another question .
on your birthday ... ... why do you always end up in the bathtub in the fetal position clutching a firearm ?
and one more .
why did you always weep like a little girl during orgasm ?
fear of intimacy .
judy .
you' re heading for a crash , steve tobias .
into a mountain called self awareness .
you have been running away from yourself your whole life .
no , i' ve been running away from you !
because i' m the only one that' s got your number !

well , i stand before you this evening as a very , very happy man .
not only has the almighty seen fit ... ... to provide me with a beautiful new daughter ... ... but i am blessed with this man here on my left .
a man who' s given so much to so many .
a man who has a taste for adventure ...
this is your father , right ?
my dad ? ... who is willing to try new things .
damn it !
let' s take the stairs !
now !
but most importantly ... ... a man who i know will always be close in my heart .
a man who i ...
he is mentally ill !
no , i mean it , he' s dangerous !
listen , he gave me a roofie !
he took me on a plane to france !
yeah , i took him to france !

i' m ... there' s 100 guns pointing at my head !
they think you' re the fat cobra .
because you told them !
no , i didn' t .
you told them !
no , i didn' t !
meliss ?
okay .
it may not be the best time to tell you this ... ... but a couple of years ago , i slept with marc .
and i think i' m still in love with him .
what ?
yesterday , i was a respected man in my community .
today , they want to kill me !
my life is ruined !
jerry , i am sorry i ruined your life , but you know what ?
this case is my life .
i' m on a roof .
i don' t do roofs .
peyser , down on the ground !
on the ground now !
well , buddy , i guess this is it , huh ?
we tried .

what , are you crazy ?
fine , i' il hug you .
no !
what are you ... ?
wait !
wait !
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ? !
holy mother of god !
now , you' re gonna feel a slight jerk .
you' re so much more than a slight jerk !
that' s not very nice .
jerry , listen to me .
i need you to keep your weight centered !
my weight' s fine !
help !
we' re fine !
help !
have a good night !
get control !
get control , you schmuck !
you' re not exactly helping things , jer .
helping how ?
unwrap your legs .
what ?
unwrap your legs !
all right !
thank you .
i guess i forgot to take parachute etiquette when i went to medical school !
this isn' t fun .
you gotta stop and smell those roses .
don' t ever use that expression again !
ever !
we' re about to get impaled by that !
what the hell is that ?
i don' t know .
i' ve always hated it .
jer ?
hold on to me !
i' il hold on to you !
it' s okay .
we' re down .
easy , jer .
get off me !
i' m choking !
all right .
we' re safe and sound .
unbuckle it .
quick .
we' re neither !
we are .
okay , pal , let' s get the hell out of here .
no , no .
i am done !
i' m finished with you !
i mean it !
what do you mean ?
when i thought i was gonna die , you know what image is in my head ?
no .
i' m thinking of that look my daughter gave me up there .
i' ve given her these things she doesn' t want , and the one time she needs me ... ... where am i ?
i' m with you !
something you should work on , jer .
what did you say ?
i said ... i have to work on that ?
the worst father in the universe is telling me i gotta work on something ?
do you know in the last three months i have spent almost every day with your kid ?
have you seen him even once ?
were you even there for conception ?
i bet you mailed your sperm in .
i may be bad , granted , but you' re worse !
way worse !
and you know i' m right !
you' re way off course .
what is he doing here ?
my least favorite person .
you wanna do something about it , fanny boy ?
i do .
i really do .
let' s go .
come on .
bring it on .
you wanna fight me ?
three rounds .
let' s do it the right way .
he' il referee , we' il ... it was before i even met you .
it doesn' t bother me that you went out with someone before you met me .
i went out with other guys !
but that' s not even ...
you went out with other guys ?
who ?
i' ve told you about them .
and that' s the thing .
you weren' t as honest with me as i was with you .
and by the way , can you just tell me what your dad really does ?
because he' s got a few too many prada and gucci outfits to be a xerox salesman .
i can' t say .
what ?
i mean , i really ...
i' m not allowed to say .
he made me vow .
and i gave him my word .
how good is your word ?
okay .
i just think you' re feeling a little nervous about the wedding .
don' t tell me what i' m feeling !
my father does that .
so , what are you doing ?
just confirming .
cherkasov' s got her in position five miles offshore .
thibodoux' s guy is en route , and they' re both set for a noon exchange time .
i guess i can squeeze it in between the " i dos " and the appetizers .
unless you think i' m ready to take the lead .
excuse me .
that' s what i thought .
always a bridesmaid , never a bride .
don' t worry , i' m used to it .
push everything back .
meaning what ?
the whole exchange .
cherkasov , thibodoux , the money , everything .
put it off until tomorrow when the kids are on their honeymoon .
i thought you were gonna juggle both .
you always do .
i am tired of juggling .
cherkasov and thibodoux are not gonna like this .
well , they can kiss my ass .
fair enough .
did you get the tuxedos from the dry cleaners ?
i sure did .
what about the pictures ?
jacket pocket .
anything else ?
you look very nice this evening .
thank you .
what are you doing ?
i' m just waiting for you , mr .
bright eyes .
you dressed me ?
yes , i did .
so , jer , we gotta talk .
i know we' ve had our differences , but our son and daughter are gonna be married .
and whether we like it or not , we' re stuck with each other .
yeah .
so you knocked some sense into me , father wise ... ... and i' m gonna be changing my lifestyle .
no more shenanigans .
and i' m not working today .
does the fbi know about this ?
it won' t be a problem .
this wedding is gonna be as normal as butter on mashed potatoes .
come on , let' s go .
freeze !
like butter on mashed potatoes , huh ?
that lasted about 10 minutes .
jer , just relax .
hutchins ... ... do you have kids ?
i have a jack russell terrier .
well , then you' il understand .
you gotta give me two hours .
you' re kidding me !
this is my son' s wedding .
you can do anything you want to me afterwards .
you can take me out back , shoot me , be a hero .
but let me see my boy get married .
or ...
hey !
hey !
hey !
well , maybe you ought to just see this .
what ?
where' d you get ... ?
this was in college , man .
i was pledging .
wow .
stand down !
that' s a big pair of heels .
hutch , thanks so much .
yeah , thank you .
we' il send out some cake later .
yeah , we' il be right here !
that was fun !
yeah .
blackmail .
it' s terrific .
jerry !
uncle ben !
mazel tov .
thanks .
where' s marc and melissa ?
where are they ?
where are they ?
i don' t know .
where are they ?
i don' t know .
ben , i' m asking you .
i' m asking you .
i' m asking you .
all right , stop !
we' re turning into abbott and costello .
i' m sure they' re here .
dr. peyser .
hi , rabbi .
we' re already behind schedule , and i do have two other ceremonies this afternoon .
and that buddhist monk ...
that was not my idea .
what' s wrong with him ?
he' s an idiot .
okay .
well , let me talk to him .
thank you .
i don' t know one person here !
not one person .
that' s right , because it' s not an arms convention .
talk to these guys .
hey , guys !
hey .
hi , who are you ?
marc' s frat brothers .
who are you ?
i' m marc' s dad .
seriously ?
yeah .
marc never mentioned he had a dad .
like , not ever .
well , i' m traveling a lot .
i just assumed that you were dead or in jail .
me too .
well , fuck you very much and have another beer .
thanks a lot .
thanks .
mr. monk ... ... if you two can' t work this out , the planet is doomed .
what can i do ?
just talk to her .
dr. peyser .
hi .
gloria , from before .
yeah , i know .
hi , gloria .
have you seen melissa ?
no , where is she ?
i' m a little worried .
i got really wasted last night , and i did this my best friend' s wedding thing ... ... and told her i dated marc one time .
you what ?
i think she may have bolted .
so , i thought you' d like to know the wedding is off .
why ?
what happened ?
marc and melissa have vanished .
jerry , calm down .
it' s all gonna be all right .
melissa .
melissa !
hey !
i' il be right back .
melissa !
melissa ... ... i know you' re a little stressed out .
well , so am i .
you know , it' s a big day and , you know , you' re confused .
i was confused on the day i got married .
obviously .
i' ve never seen marc happier , and i know it' s because of you .
and i get down on my knees , and i thank that big man up there ... ... for you coming into his life .
and to tell you that the second i saw you , i knew ... ... you' re the best girl in the world .
hi , steve .
oh , my god .
what are you doing in that dress ?
i won' t be the bridesmaid anymore .
do you understand ?
no !
no , not really .
no .
i taught you .
when you' re ready , take the lead .
well , i' m ready , and i' m taking the lead .
i don' t wanna end up like you , steve .
no personal life ... ... a family that hates you .
i choose happiness !
it' s really a breakthrough for me .
now , where' s the money ?
it' s in a case in the warehouse .
the case in the warehouse is empty .
we want the money .
we ?
jesus christ .
oh , god .
what a lovely setting .
i see your touch in the decor , no ?
i worked with the designer a little .
why , it' s wonderful .
i was on my way here , excited about my submarine , and then i realized something .
do you want to know what it was that i realized ?
sure .
i was more excited to see you .
i cannot get you out of my mind .
okay .
i am attracted to you physically , which for me is very strange ... ... because i find homosexuality disgusting !
this is a big subject .
and , you know , the wedding , so i actually have to find my family .
i' il talk to you later .
i have them .
you what ?
what are you doing in that ?
steven , i see you have met my partner .
yeah , you make a lovely couple .
so where' s cherkasov ?
dead .
what about olga ?
steven tobias , you son of a bitch !
lf we don' t die , i' m gonna kill you , dad !
you suck !
she' s wearing my dress !
quiet !
if i give you the money ... ... will you leave everybody here unharmed ?
of course .
hi .
since we can' t find the bride and the groom , we' re just gonna open up the bar .
so everybody have a cocktail !
that would' ve made a great gift .
now get out .
are you coming , sweet cobra ?
daddy , this is weird .
where you going , jerry ?
i' m sorry , katherine .
can i talk to you alone for one second ?
it' s about us .
we don' t have time to dilly dally .
pull around the boat .
what is it , darling ?
what am i to you , exactly ?
a plaything ?
or a toy ?
no , no , no .
okay .
let' s do this the right way .
jean pierre , i love you .
and i want you to be ... ... my wife !
how' s the plantar fasciitis now ? !
help !
jean pierre , come on , we have to go .
i keep making myself vulnerable .
focus on revenge .
well , steve ... ... you have ruined this darling girl' s wedding .
no , no .
i' m okay .
no , you' re not !
you will carry the scar of this day until you die .
all right , i guess i am kind of sad .
judy , how is this helpful ?
would both of you please just stop it ? !
why don' t you give me a break , huh ?
i' il break your neck !
that' s good , marc .
express your anger .
you want a piece of me ?
you bet i do !
here it goes !
oh , my god !
what was that ?
the one time my dad showed up at cub scouts ... ... i earned a merit badge in covert evasion techniques .
what happened ?
we broke up .
what is that ?
that , my friend , is olga .
in lake michigan ?
so much for homeland security .
i' m excited to go on a submarine .
what was your name again ?
it' s angela .
goodbye , angela .
what are you doing ?
taking preventative measures .
to prevent what ?
may be a torpedo heading towards the wedding .
what ?
i' m gonna come with you .
sorry , buddy .
it' s a one man job .
you drag me around the world when i don' t want to go .
the one time i want to , you say no ?
it' s my family too .
i' m going .
you can' t stop me .
wow , jer .
get on .
on this ?
okay .
what is the plan ?
the juliett class torpedo has an acoustic guidance system .
it tracks whatever' s making the most noise .
so if he pulls the trigger , we' ve gotta divert the torpedo .
towards what ?
let me rephrase the question .
what does the torpedo wind up hitting ?
you said you wanted to help .
oh , my god .
that' s before i knew the plan !
it' s a terrible plan !
how are you doing ?
you doing okay ?
yeah .
you know , i got a few questions , like ... ... what the hell is happening ?
my father is in the cia .
he works deep undercover .
i' ve spent my life hiding that , but that' s the truth .
i dated a few skanky girls before i met you .
i don' t really like being a lawyer .
played with legos until i was 17 ... ... and i go to a colorist because i' m prematurely gray .
it' s a rinse .
really ?
i don' t want to hide anything from you anymore , because i don' t care !
all i care about is you !
marc !
what ?
i love you .
what are we doing now ?
why are we turning ?
make noise !
quiet !
no noise !
hi !
wait , wait !
i' ve got something ... ... in my fanny pack !
look !
i' il never make a crack again !
yeah , because we' il be dead !
hold on !
hold on !
i' m gonna throw up !
it' s coming at us !
could you stop that , please ?
touchy .
all in all , i' m glad i met you !
me too , buddy !
i mean it !
you' re the real thing !
i' m sorry i called you the worst father in the world !
i really didn' t mean it !
thank you , jer .
i' m sure there' s at least two or three guys that are worse !
that' s so awesome !
marc ?
marc ?
honey ?
honey ?
honey , are you okay ?
baby , are you okay ?
yeah , but there' s cake in my shorts .
wait .
we' re gonna go freshen up .
are you guys all right ?
steve ?
we just wanted to let you know this was the worst wedding we have ever been to .
you should thank jerry .
he put it all together .
thanks for coming .
we gotta do something about this .
come on .
i know you all got a lot of questions , but listen up .
i am deep cover cia , case number 3924 .
peter markell' s my sole contact at the agency .
all right .
well , we' re gonna check that out .
you know , you almost blew my cover a few times .
but i don' t want an apology ... ... because i think i got a way that you can make it up .
and do you , melissa , take marc to be your wedded husband ... ... to have and to hold from this day forward ... ... for better or worse , for richer or poorer ... ... in sickness and in health , till death do you part ?
i do .
by the power vested in me by the federal bureau of investigation ... ... i now pronounce you man and wife .
you may kiss the bride .
yeah .
mazel tov !
mazel tov .
you know how i run around and try to save the world ?
dad , it' s okay .
no , no .
no .
what i want you to know is , you are my world , marc .
i' m so proud of you .
congratulations .
i know we fought a lot , but we must have done something right .
he' s a great kid .
and you' re a very good mother .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
and i still hate you .
but i do have a room back at the club .
i am so sorry about the wedding .
what are you talking about ?
daddy , don' t you realize ?
what ?
this is exactly what i wanted .
six people on a beach .
good .
i love you .
thank you .
i love you too .
thanks .
six people on a beach .
i could have saved a fortune !
jer , you' re gonna be fine .
as a matter of fact ... ... the whole family , they' re gonna be just fine .
cobra !
fat cobra !
it' s all right , darling !
i forgive you !
call me .
you know something ?
he might actually like prison .
like it ?
he' s gonna love it .
