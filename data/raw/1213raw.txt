sleep well , oh people of bagdad !
all is quiet !
sleep !
sleep , oh dwellers of bagdad !
all is quiet !
look straight ahead of you !
go !
sleep , oh people of bagdad .
all is quiet .
the name ? !
tell me , wise star !
tell me the name !
aladdin , son of ali al marouf !
aladdin , son of ali al marouf !
oh , most esteemed sprinkler of the streets !
do you know a certain aladdin , son of ali al marouf ?
you' re sure you don' t mean karim who fell into the pond and ran stark naked around the town ?
or maybe houssein who hoisted his donkey to the minaret ?
allah punished him by making him blind in one eye .
where are you going ?
wait !
oh , masters of the best of games except for playing with dice !
could you tell me ...
oh , honored one , where might i find aladdin , son of ali al marouf ?
bagdad is a large city ...
you' ve been reading for 2 hours without paying me a thing !
oh , most worthy keeper of knowledge ! ..
people of bagdad !
quickly , stranger , quickly !
the beauty of all beauties , the unrivaled princess boudour , honors the baths with her presence !
any who dares to look upon the princess shall lose his head !
i don' t want to !
i don' t want to bathe !
i don' t want to !
i don' t want to !
what do you want , then ?
i want him to look upon me .
then he' il have his head cut off .
so what ?
mustafa !
young man , open your eyes !
come on , and you' il have no head .
i wish that a wild lion would pounce on you , so that i could kill him .
i wish that a fire would engulf all bagdad and i' d rescue you .
and that an earthquake would cause all people to perish ,
leaving only two of us , you and me .
what name were you given ?
aladdin , son of ali al marouf .
you can' t take the princess ' hand .
i' ve already done so .
cut off his head anyway ...
strike the blow !
what' s the matter with you ?
catch him , dead or alive !
mother !
i held the hand of the sultan' s daughter , boudour !
you must ask the sultan for his daughter' s hand .
and yesterday he said he was flying on dragons .
ls this not the dwelling of the chosen one and the king of luck , aladdin ?
aladdin is my son .
here are presents for you from your uncle !
i didn' t know my husband was blessed with a brother .
ls this not the house of aladdin , son of ali al marouf ?
from my uncle ?
your uncle .
they must have made a mistake .
they' il come and take it all back .
where is my brother ?
where' s my brother , ali al marouf ?
ali al marouf has been dead for three years .
i was his best friend .
oh , my miserable brother !
oh , how cruel and bitter my fate !
forty years have i wandered over the earth !
i dreamed of coming back and embracing my brother !
but my ali didn' t have any brother .
believing me dead he couldn' t bear to mention my name .
where is the place the deceased loved most ?
where' s my nephew aladdin ?
there !
my cherished nephew , tell me your innermost desire .
i shall grant it .
he will ask you for a star from the heavens .
he has just wanted me to ask for princess boudour' s hand !
could he be possessed by genies ?
i will cure him .
leave us now !
for 40 years i have studied alchemy and black magic with the wisest men of all maghrib .
forty years have i dedicated to the preparation of magic powders that' d open the gates of dungeons and reveal the darkest secrets .
put your trust in me .
i will help you .
where are we going , uncle ?
to an enchanted city .
why ?
you alone will penetrate a place from which no one' s ever returned .
there you' il find an old bronze lamp .
repeat it !
an old bronze lamp ...
you will bring it to me and all your wishes will be granted .
go now !
the entrance is there !
you' il get in the shadow of the city and in the city of shadows .
who is there ?
who is there ?
who is there ?
who is there ?
who sneezed ?
show yourself !
why have you come here ?
i came to find the lamp !
amazing !
lncredible !
he said the truth !
i must have the lamp and i' ve just told you so .
what shall we do ?
i don' t know .
hey !
where are you ?
where are you hiding ?
silence !
you' re disturbing our meditation !
take the lamp .
it is yours .
where will i find it ?
show him the way .
this way .
this way !
this way !
ls this it ?
what are you doing , uncle ?
uncle ? !
aladdin !
where are you ?
come back at once !
aladdin , i was only joking !
aladdin !
i hear and obey !
who are you ?
i' m this lamp' s slave .
i' m at your command !
are you a genie ?
yes .
why did my uncle want to kill me ?
he is not your uncle .
he' s an evil maghribian sorcerer .
we genies have long known him .
i' m yours to command !
to do what ?
what you will .
strangle him ?
drown him ?
reduce him to dust ?
no !
no !
let him go to all four corners of the earth .
to all four corners of the earth ?
i hear and obey !
i don' t want to !
we don' t want to !
the blessings of allah be upon you !
wake up !
it' s time to bake cakes .
allah has granted us another fine day .
i wish i had a skewer of shish kebab !
i didn' t know you were a joker !
you play little jokes , too .
who started the fire ?
i didn' t know you could make cakes .
i' m eighty five , but never have i made a single cake .
have a cake !
genies never eat cakes .
what do genies eat , then ?
nothing at all .
i' d like you to meet my friend the genie .
i' d rather stay in the lamp .
i knew that all that reading would end up badly .
remember , i haven' t seen anything .
you haven' t seen anything either .
neither of us have seen anything .
do you know why i have lived to be 85 ?
all is quiet in bagdad !
to live to be 100 years old , you must learn to be virtuous .
the basis for all good is in holding the spirit in check , in humility and in piety , and above all in chastity , in patience and modesty .
each of us must know when to give proof of our modesty and when to show impertinence .
and to act so as to be permanently exploring good .
because the state of perfection is modesty , and the state of evil is another kind of modesty .
will you come out for a second ?
are you listening to me ?
yes .
guards !
don' t be afraid !
who are you ?
who am l ?
and who are you ?
who am l ?
but who are you ?
princess boudour .
who ?
the princess boudour .
that' s all we needed .
who' s that mumbling there ?
where' s that voice coming from ?
it' s a loafer who' s listened to too many silly stories .
come here !
what' s that ?
ajar .
and what' s that ?
that ?
an oven !
an oven ...
for baking meat cakes .
you understand ?
no .
what is this mysterious monster ?
it' s a goat , not a monster .
does it make the cheese ?
how old are you ?
i' m sixteen .
i already knew what a goat is when i was three years old .
they' re looking for someone .
perhaps for the bagdad thief .
they' re not looking forjust one , but for forty of them .
ah , it' s you ?
yes , it' s me .
why are you laughing ?
i know what you' re going to ask me .
what ?
i' ve already been asked by 1 7 princes .
poor princes .
i refused them all .
then it' s " no " ?
why not ?
go to my father and ask for my hand .
and will you say " yes " ?
how should i know what i' il say ?
i' il say whatever comes to my head !
the princess is here !
that' s you again !
tie him up !
yes !
tie him !
i hope princess boudour will forgive me !
my sultan , he' s the one who dared gaze on the princess twice .
sultan !
it' s real luck , my meeting you like this .
i' m asking for the hand of princess boudour .
what did he say ?
my tongue refuses to repeat it .
your daughter likes me and i like her .
only she says she won' t marry me without your permission .
yes , sire .
our great sultan asks whether you know , young man , that seventeen princes ...
eighteen princes !
that 19 princes have already come to ask for the fair boudour' s hand .
she did tell me that .
before asking for marriage , you should offer the sultan presents .
you mean rubies and emeralds ?
precisely !
oh , i forgot about that !
i' il have them brought here right away .
do you have a treasure buried at your house ?
i' ve got no treasure .
but i have a genie friend .
what ?
a genie .
stay there !
throw him in the dungeon !
daughter of ours !
we' re most displeased .
i' m the one who' s displeased !
you' ve refused all of the princes .
there' re no princes left .
and you did it in order to end up in a beggar' s hut .
don' t you dare call him that bad name !
what name should i call him ?
aladdin !
from now on we shall call by name every beggar and good for nothing .
shut up !
who is to shut up ?
us ?
you will set him free at once and ask for his forgiveness .
those were your last words .
we' il have you wedded today .
try and see what happens .
i' il try .
well , so !
remember it and write it down !
write it down .
we shall give our daughter and half our kingdom to ...
to the very first man to walk through that door .
from now on , half our kingdom and our daughter belong to your son .
out of my way !
grab the princess !
no one has anything to suggest to us ?
there is a way .
speak up .
since your daughter went to bagdad and acquired bad habits there , we should convince her that she never visited bagdad .
how ?
the princess must be told it was just a dream .
since it was but a dream and nothing has happened to her , she will be obedient again .
and the heart of our great sultan will rejoice .
and what does the great wiseman say ?
a dream' s not that' s not a dream , and not a dream is not a dream .
so to say of not a dream that it' s a dream is the same as to say of a dream that it' s not .
we order to say of a dream that it is not one , and of not a dream , that it' s a dream ...
the princess went nowhere .
she dreamed it all .
everybody understood us ?
be off with you !
i even saw in a dream that i taught crocodiles to read in persian .
i have also dreamed that i was a minaret and that from my top the muezzins were crying .
i have even dreamed that my hair walked to the bazaar to buy a comb .
so what ?
so you' ve only dreamed about that beggar .
lf i dreamed it , how come mubarak fought with him ?
mubarak !
i' m told that yesterday you fought with some beggar .
yesterday i didn' t go any place .
i mean i hunted and killed ...
a lion .
a lion !
yes !
i remember it very well .
i was in bagdad and i saw a goat .
a what ?
a goat .
it' s true .
and mustafa brought me back to the palace .
mustafa !
i' m told that yesterday ...
who ?
me ?
the last two days i spent in bed with a toothache .
our daughter boudour , we' re not angry with you .
tell me , it did happen , didn' t it ?
you did scold me about aladdin !
i scolded you about prince abou abdul ibn abdul ...
no !
aladdin !
i' ve never heard of aladdin .
how can it be ?
aladdin !
then i dreamed it .
all this was just a dream .
tomorrow you' il lose your head .
any other news ?
do you hear that music ?
i' m marrying princess boudour !
are you in there ?
i hear and obey .
have you no shame ?
what ?
why did you let them throw aladdin in a dungeon ?
all you had to do is to rub the lamp .
couldn' t you guess it yourself ?
it' s not my concern .
i knew it would end badly !
oh , my heart' s joy !
my little camel !
bring aladdin back !
take your lamp and your genie !
i never want to see them again !
i' il teach you how to fly on dragons !
i' il teach you how to ask for princess boudour' s hand !
i pray that' s not the goat !
the lamp will be mine !
oh , the brightest of all stars !
he flew away !
he' s flown away !
where' s mubarak ?
who has flown away ?
mubarak !
what is the meaning of this ?
get me down from here !
what are you doing there ?
come down !
i can' t !
get me down from here !
how did you climb up there ?
let him stay up there !
jump !
i' m stuck !
why did you climb up there ?
i didn' t climb up there .
everybody saw you up there !
since you climbed up there , you might as well say so .
oh great sultan , pardon this foolish child !
it is only because he' s young and has too much passion .
all right .
we' il leave them once more .
stay here !
what if he flies away again ?
just let him try to .
oh , heavenly one ...
oh , the brightest of all ... ... stars !
good night , boudour !
i' m the son of the grand vizier !
what a clever genie !
what would the son of a vizier be doing in a jar ?
make way for the great sultan !
so , whoever is stuffed in the jar claims to be my son !
who is in there ?
mubarak ! ls that you ?
get them all out of here !
get them out !
why did you get in the jar ?
i didn' t .
lousy liar !
everyone saw you in thatjar .
why did you stuff yourself in there ?
whether or not he got in there no longer interests us .
lf he prefers stuffing jars to half my kingdom and my daughter , just let him stuff them .
announce it to all of bagdad !
from this moment on , the son of the vizier and princess boudour are no longer husband and wife !
ln ten thousand years i haven' t laughed so much !
let' s stuff someone else into a jar !
wait .
we' ve other things to do .
go away !
why ?
because when i wake up and you' re not here , it will be so painful .
wait !
let this dream go on and on ...
i don' t want to wake up .
it' s no dream .
i simply have a genie friend .
don' t you believe me ?
rub this .
then it wasn' t a dream , but pure and simple magic ?
you can do anything ?
that' s right !
you must swear it .
it' s you women who need to swear , but we genies always speak the truth .
well , then , bring me a peach .
so it was real !
i was not dreaming at all .
they have deceived me !
what' s all this for ?
the wedding !
whose wedding ?
ours .
don' t interefere .
salam .
salam .
what is all this ?
what does it mean ?
it means you' re sleeping .
what d' you mean , i' m sleeping ?
they are sleeping , too .
and i' m too .
we' re all sleeping and seeing a dream .
now we' il have a wedding !
here' s my fiance !
you' re in prison , aren' t you ?
now you see it' s just a dream !
don' t try to confuse us .
what says the vizier ?
let the wiseman speak first .
what says the wiseman ?
the realization of knowledge is a sign of ignorance , and ...
but why me ?
and why me rather than you ?
a goat !
yes , a goat !
it is my goat !
look !
don' t be afraid .
it' s a dream .
let me explain it .
don' t be scared !
everything' s possible here !
we' re just dreaming .
you understand ?
he doesn' t !
don' t be afraid !
look .
i' m pushing you .
now you push me !
that' s right !
be seated , honored guests .
after all , it' s a wedding !
look at him .
where' s he now ? ln prison .
he' s to be executed .
oh , when we wake up , have him executed too .
and what is he now ?
a bridegroom at his wedding .
he is happy !
and we are happy !
lsn' t it swell to have a wedding !
when i married your father , it was not in a dream .
give the lamp back .
no , i won' t .
i don' t want it this way .
give it .
and i like it this way .
don' t quarrel .
i' il give you a spinning wheel .
and what is that ?
you will like it .
no mercy for me , and no forgiveness , my dear nephew !
kill me as you would kill a mad dog .
or i shall kill myself and take the sin on my soul !
what' s stopping you ?
to the count of three .
one .
two .
it' s a bad dream .
we' d better awaken .
two and a half .
aladdin , don' t spoil the wedding !
two and a quarter !
all right .
i forgive you .
why does no one glorify us ?
oh incomparable sultan , whose brightness is eclipsing moon and sun and fiery meteors , and all the world' s emperors !
this pleases us .
i shall go milk the goat .
give the lamp back .
no , i will not !
give it back !
no , i won' t !
will you give it back ?
i want our wedding to be real and not a dream .
it is real .
lf you don' t give it , i' m going !
then you don' t love me .
go !
and take your lamp , too !
we call you .
i won' t come !
come out !
no , i won' t !
what are you supposed to say ?
i hear and obey .
who are you ?
i' m the lamp' s slave .
repeat it .
i' m the lamp' s slave .
louder !
i can' t hear you !
i' m the lamp' s slave !
the wedding is going on .
i' m the bridegroom !
sultan .
a miracle' s happened !
long live the new sultan al salam kerim !
a sultan the world has not yet beheld .
the wisest of all sultans !
the wisest .
i ask your forgiveness .
but i have to kill you .
go ahead , kill me !
i' m your friend , but i' m the lamp' s slave !
yes , of course .
i' m the lamp' s slave , but i' m your friend !
a slave or a friend ?
get in this jug .
why ?
you' il live in the jug .
no genie ever lived in a jug .
you' il be the first then .
all right ?
rub me .
i hear and obey .
i dreamed i was a sultan .
don' t get distracted .
come out !
i dreamed i milked a goat .
and like a bright star ,
like the constellation of the lion among ordinary lions , shines the name of our great ...
traitor !
our daughter boudour !
won' t you come in ?
all is quiet in bagdad .
all is quiet in bagdad , all is quiet , quiet ,
all is quiet in bagdad , all is quiet , quiet ...
for children up to 16 years old ...
the end
