to my first master , jean pierre melville v. s.
coup de grace
the baltlc states 1919/ 20
directed by volker schlndorff
i recall little of these far off struggles against bolshevism in livonia and kurland .
it is said that the dead ride quickly , but so do the living .
michel !
take the horse .
for konrad , it meant going back to his childhood .
kratovice was in that lost borderland of eastern europe where russian or german place names no longer meant anything .
the master is back !
sister !
welcome , reval !
to the health of the prodigal brother !
you' re unrecognizable .
what ?
unrecognizable !
you too .
did you cut your hair ?
you' re more beautiful that way .
merciful lord !
aunt praskovia !
i prayed for you day and night .
the blessed virgin heard me .
what a joy to see you , my boy .
you look pale .
we' ve been fighting .
i can see .
you haven' t shaved .
lhomond , he' s a true soldier .
always on the go .
very brave .
our comrades in arms , the officers from kronstadt .
the mind raises itself .
the body remains on the sofa .
on your way here , you could assess the military situation .
bolshevism is infecting the entire population .
the enemy is invisible .
by day it hides in the woods .
at night it comes to the villages to be fed by the inhabitants .
i' ve set your nightshirts to warm up in the flue of the stove
like in the old days .
where is sophie ?
she won' t appear again tonight .
the young mistress dines in her room .
thank goodness they' re back .
i' m very glad they' ve arrived , my dear .
now i' m very tired .
goodnight , aunt .
sleep well .
good night , sophie .
the men lack discipline .
neither war nor revolution are ruining the land as much as its saviors .
just tell yourself it' s a foxhunt that' il last until the war ends .
sophie had changed .
until our arrival , she had been but a frightened prisoner .
her brother konrad' s presence restored her to her role as mistress of the mansion .
the smell of the fields after a battle is unmistakable .
the first dead body .
it leaves an indelible impression .
a hand that springs from the earth , blue hued lips on white teeth .
prepare for it all you like , but it' s always the same horror mangled bodies , shattered skulls , deathly faces .
and you wait impatiently for the cry that will begin the attack .
the fields will turn to marshes if the sewers aren' t repaired by spring .
the servants have left .
except mila and old michel .
we' il get it back in order as it was before .
look , a carp .
fantastic .
put it in the bag .
after the war , we' il turn this house into a place where writers and artists can meet to talk , work and live together .
good morning .
first man .
good morning .
morning , erich .
where were you ?
at the pond .
we went fishing .
are there still fish in our pond ?
i' il cook it with fines herbes .
we must draw up an inventory to know where we stand .
let' s go .
the men must be deloused .
they' re incredibly filthy .
paul can' t do it all .
i hope you enjoyed your meal !
what a nice surprise .
coffee !
like before the revolution .
but there' s no sugar .
just as long as you' re here .
it' s completely out of tune .
there must be something inside .
a bullet .
will you dance ?
not now .
look at those pictures .
aunt praskovia when she looked human .
aren' t there any of you ?
the young blonde haired girl is me .
it' s inscribed " sonja .
i dislike nicknames .
everyone used to call me sonja .
i prefer sophie .
are you comfortable ?
did you enjoy the meal ?
and the apple ?
wonderful .
you' re quiet , aunt .
what do you want me to say ?
alarm . !
two men on guard .
a mortar near the pond .
merciful lord .
they' il kill us all .
keep calm .
it' s nothing .
we' il bring them to their senses .
cut off their heads !
turn out the light !
orders from the commander of the landwehr .
1 .
each member of the gang is declared an outlaw whom anyone can kill or wound to put out of action .
2 .
the commander' s cashier will pay a reward for each red killed amounting to 100 eastern rubles .
3 .
the same amount will be paid to anyone giving information
leading to the capture of a red .
4 .
each inhabitant is duty bound to give relevant information to the military as quickly as possible .
those who do not denounce the reds or who assist them will be executed immediately .
stop , you bastards !
you stupid fools !
who are you ?
leave him be .
are you german ?
yes ... and there are more germans around .
we' il get rid of you .
how did you get to the other side ?
i was a prisoner in siberia .
and you were recruited by the reds ?
what did they promise you ?
where do you come from ?
darmstadt .
what' s your job ?
fitter .
do you still have any relations in germany ?
are you a communist ?
yes .
i don' t care what you do to me .
may i come in ?
of course .
thank you .
it' s quite late , sophie .
i' il just smoke a pipeful .
why did you come to kratovice of all places , erich ?
where should i have gone ?
you could have stayed in paris or berlin .
no one forced you to fight in this war .
i' m an officer , and useless in berlin .
what are you defending here ?
your mother lost everything before the war .
perhaps i like lost causes .
in any case , i' ve always fought for them .
at least you' ve none of konrad' s illusions .
konrad' s beliefs are truer than yours , sophie .
his don' t come from books , but from life , from your family tradition .
the new era has no use for our tradition .
no one chooses his own story .
oh , yes .
you should go to bed , sophie .
do you have a mistress ?
some woman must be waiting for you in germany or france .
franz tells me women are fond of you .
i have no mistress , sophie .
you don' t want to talk about it .
my affairs with women have been short and trivial .
there' s nothing to say .
a brief affair can be beautiful .
women want lasting relationships .
friendship means more to me .
than love ?
it' s more reliable .
you' ve only met the worst sort of women .
on the contrary , i thought them the best .
in any case , they didn' t try to play a part in my life .
sophie barely hid her sympathy for the reds , especially her friend grigori loew , son of thejewish tailor and midwife .
my brother is back .
how is the young man ?
isn' t erich von lhomond here , too ?
that' s right .
how did you know ?
the whole village knows .
they' re afraid of him .
he' s an excellent officer .
pity he' s always on the wrong side .
are there more soldiers coming ?
who' s likely to come here ?
erich will try to hold the house as long as he can .
there are enough mercenaries and adventurers at home in any war .
what can a von lhomond do in berlin ?
an out of work officer !
he prefers to lord it over everyone here .
you should take care of your hands .
erich came back for us .
the material is beautiful .
very easy to alter .
may i take it ?
of course , but we' il need it for the meeting .
i' il bring it back .
there' s a table inside .
it' s nice here .
do you trust me ?
the day is not purer than your heart .
why shouldn' t i trust you ?
i' m in love with you .
and if you want ...
i have no hope of earning my living anywhere in europe .
it doesn' t matter .
i couldn' t offer you the life you deserve .
you' re mocking me .
you don' t even know me .
we spent our childhood together .
i remind you of your brother .
you think i am as honorable as he is .
i' m not the man for you .
it doesn' t have to be serious .
with you it' s always serious .
you must go .
they' re looking for arms .
they' re taking men up to the house .
there are no arms here .
you' re dangerous for us .
if they follow you , they' il find me .
i wanted to return the paper .
do you have any books for me ?
what' s the use if you go on living as before ?
what can i do ?
stay where you are .
is it konrad or lhomond who keeps you there ?
what if i joined you ?
what would lhomond say ?
my mother will know where i am if you need me .
always follow the voice of your heart .
grigori .
end of the game .
you' re not concentrating .
lhomond , don' t be a killjoy .
blankenberg , come and play .
i saw you in the village .
what were you doing there ?
visiting a friend , but he was away .
it' s dangerous to cross the lines .
everyone knows me there .
no one would dare touch me .
suppose they took you hostage to make us surrender .
would you surrender ?
typhus .
it' s impossible to go on like this .
what' s the situation ?
no more alcohol or morphine .
four weeks without typhus vaccine .
i' ve opened the last box of dressings .
i know .
we couldn' t bring any .
konrad cabled riga yesterday .
meanwhile , i' m in this mess .
forgive me .
i' m tired and depressed .
and how are you ?
i wanted to talk about sophie .
what' s this about some lithuanian soldier ?
you know about him ?
who was he ?
the same scum that war stirs up everywhere .
unfortunately , he met sophie .
what happened exactly ?
a classic rape .
a sergeant .
he was here a few days .
one night he was drunk and assaulted her .
you can imagine the rest .
konrad wasn' t here .
fortunately , he never found out .
sophie was afraid she was pregnant .
it really upset her .
chopin was here .
he wanted to kill him , but he was wounded at that moment and sent behind the lines .
you should look after sophie .
it will be good for her .
i' m so fed up with all this .
where were you before ?
on the western front .
douaumond .
this isn' t a war anymore .
why did you come ?
you should have stayed at home .
positions .
prepare ... aim ... ready ... fire . !
i' m sorry you had to hear that .
it wasn' t the first time .
i' m on patrol .
would you like to come ?
all right .
everything all right ?
yes , sir .
awful weather .
looks like rain .
take a gun .
i don' t shoot .
that' s a pity .
you used to have a steady shooting hand .
the panes must be replaced .
if there' s no glass , use oiled paper .
even if he died an atheist , he was born a christian .
he was just a young fellow , the kid from darmstadt .
if you really loved another woman , it would be easier for me to give up .
then you don' t know yourself very well .
you' d do everything to separate us .
texas .
good morning .
it' s so deserted here today .
where are my brother and his men ?
gone to riga , to the main quarters .
the telephones don' t work .
nobody is familiar with the military situation anymore .
but if you ask me , they just wanted some fun .
you should have gone , too .
i don' t like that sort of fun much .
don' t look at me like that .
i feel ugly today .
i adore you , sophie .
you' re not ugly .
but you look sad .
isn' t there anything i can do ?
i' d like to help you .
we went to riga to discuss the details of the next offensive .
we learned that the allies favored the soviets , depriving our obstinate resistance of all meaning .
careful of the ice .
imagine being killed in a car .
during the war !
take that to the kitchen .
that' s my sister sophie .
forgive me , ma' am .
borschikoff !
there was no medicine in riga .
but we got a case of champagne .
sophie , what is it ?
you look pale .
we could' ve been even paler !
the trip was for nothing .
until we meet again
on the green shores of the baltic
ah , the doctor !
a specialty from riga .
real french champagne .
not like our hungarian ladies who tried to pass for french .
that russian was a real moscow jewess .
erich fell for the parisian charm of a hungarian named madeleine .
she clung to him like an octopus with her long , white gloved fingers .
at 5 : 00 a . m .
they wanted to go for a drive .
they seem to miss that so much .
in the snow .
snow as you start is bad for the heart .
or was she really a parisian ?
erich , you should know .
you were with her .
she said she sang in a budapest cafe .
that girl was no singer !
good evening .
franz , you' re just in time .
real champagne .
they brought it from riga .
they had great fun .
they met a frenchwoman but later discovered she was hungarian .
the population is against us .
germany no longer helps us .
we should go to canada and start over on a farm .
begin a new life and forget kratovice .
erich brought me some candy .
he thinks of everything .
which is your favorite ?
marzipan .
this one here .
thanks .
if we give up now , none of this will mean anything .
the struggle , the casualties .
no one cares about us now .
would you like to go for a walk ?
gladly .
as long as we resist , we can' t be destroyed .
we must hold out at all costs .
good night .
good morning , aunt .
good morning , aunt .
some candy your favorite .
wonderful !
i love candy .
put the rest in the chest in the drawer .
your great aunt would not have allowed it .
she was very strange .
she always said someone would come to tie your laces .
she never said that to me .
she didn' t like me .
you were her favorite .
no , it was mother .
your mother ... ?
i get muddled .
i must be getting senile .
i didn' t want to marry so early .
my god , 19 was early then .
i didn' t want that .
you never did get married .
i didn' t get married .
i was too young .
i didn' t want to marry at all .
i wasn' t interested in marrying .
what are you doing over there ?
standing by the window .
erich and konrad are playing in the snow .
that' s more than he ever hoped for .
you know who i saw in a dream last night ?
me ?
no , me ... dead .
in a cemetery , near the family tomb .
with my throat cut .
you mustn' t take it seriously , franz .
we' re all afraid .
i' m going to die soon , sophie .
the house is calm .
it was a dream .
you' re safe here .
where did you find him ?
behind the pond .
who is it ?
franz .
my condolences .
he was always punished for other people' s actions .
easy !
texas ?
nothing to report .
i' m going to bed .
what is it ?
sophie .
have you seen texas ?
he' s lying in the pantry .
look at him .
he dug up a grenade .
he thought it was a truffle .
are you all right ?
would you care if i died ?
if i was happy , i wouldn' t mind dying .
are you happy ?
you don' t look happy !
go away .
i' m so ashamed .
i' m only doing what i would do for konrad or any of our friends .
get undressed .
everybody gets a new sheet .
burn it all .
it' s the best way to fight infection .
two more deaths last night .
typhus .
come here , paul .
sophie shouldn' t be working here .
she' s too fragile .
no , she' s too useful .
get someone from the village .
you know we can' t .
can' t you see she' s just asking to catch typhus ?
i don' t care about her reasons .
no one asks why i do this .
she' s great with the sick .
may i have a taste ?
i made them for you .
they make my mouth water .
is this how you charm the young men of the village ?
i don' t think so .
they want something else .
you can offer that too , can' t you ?
put the apples in the cellar .
can' t you do that somewhere else ?
do you enjoy humiliating me in front of her ?
i enjoy talking to mila .
don' t tell me you' re content with such trifles .
do you like her because she won' t play a part in your life ?
why do women always fall in love with men who are not meant for them ?
so who are the women meant for you ?
whores or farm maids ?
at least you see clearly in your hysteria .
if i needed a woman , you' re the last one i' d think of .
will you stop looking after me ?
i' m not afraid .
the old woman and konrad are living here too .
if you want to die , that' s your business .
i' m responsible for the others .
responsibility and discipline !
everything else inside you is dead .
you' re incapable of passion !
you cling so tightly to life , erich .
everybody out . !
what' s the matter with the horses ?
stay calm .
damned bastard !
get the horses out !
chopin .
plessen .
glad to see you , reval .
nothing serious , i hope .
i' il find lhomond .
erich von lhomond ?
you know him ?
met him in riga .
a long time ago .
we had the same teacher .
he was an excellent student .
good to see you again .
how many men did you bring us ?
i' m sorry .
that' s not my mission .
von wirtz sent me to recall you .
the baltic states must be evacuated of german units by the end of the year .
the allies will control the retreat .
the horses are not for your pleasure . !
i told you , your escapades endanger all of us .
you weren' t so touchy before .
i didn' t mean to cause trouble .
they act as if it were peacetime .
what impudence !
good morning .
how nice of you to come , lhomond .
i came to see how you are .
i' m fine .
everyone has forgotten me .
an early taste of christmas .
mila made it .
even sophie has forgotten me .
may i ?
sit down .
do you know what i' m doing ?
i' m cutting toilet paper .
sophie is going out with volkmar .
he' s a charming man .
tell me , is it true volkmar is going to marry sophie ?
have you heard that ?
is that a rumor going around ?
i' ve heard it' s true .
she should get married soon .
she' s of an age ... really of an age .
his father had an affair with rasputin .
don' t you believe it ?
his father and rasputin ?
no , the father of what' s his name volkmar had an affair with rasputin .
he must have been a queer .
he was everything at the same time .
i' il cut this one and then you take over .
that' s a peculiar shape .
yes , each one is a different size .
you' re better at this than i.
a second time .
you make a hole to put the string through so we can hang it up .
i like volkmar .
he' s a smart fellow .
oh , we' il have to wait and see .
you can stop cutting .
it' s driving me crazy .
we don' t need that much .
come in .
i' m sorry i talked to you like that .
sit down .
no , thank you .
cigarette ?
thanks .
gen. broussaroff is surrounded at gurna .
it' s a dreadful situation .
soldiers ' councils have been formed .
i suggest we get him out .
we can deploy some troops beyond the river at olida to mine the railway and cut off the reds .
it won' t be that easy .
i' il join you with my troops .
thank you , plessen .
do you have a medic ?
bring him , too .
of course .
we leave after christmas day .
for the party tonight ,
wine is always served on the right , food on the left , and plates on the right as well .
now we just need some mistletoe .
drinks on the right , dishes on the left .
is there a pianist for me ?
here he is .
can he play ?
to have some fun , to play around
you' re behind .
wonderful
then , when it ends
a whirling waltz
faster .
he held me against his heart
so tight against his heart
you gentlemen , all my cavaliers
you are my passion
and you too , young lieutenant
i love you too
he twirled his moustache
he twirled me around
there you are .
come and join us .
midnight ?
the midnight kiss under the mistletoe .
may i , sophie ?
blankenberg , your turn .
at last .
you' re mad !
leave him .
disgraceful behavior !
i demand satisfaction .
i understand your irritation , but it' s no reason for a duel .
aren' t there enough men in the ward already ?
come on .
find a second !
stop it now !
time for bed .
go away .
can you hear me ?
i love you .
i beg you to forgive me .
forgive me .
it is i who asks forgiveness .
i' m not worthy of your love .
i should have waited .
i never loved anyone but you .
dear sophie , i am packing .
wait until i return from gurna , please .
i love you .
get ready to leave !
michel , bandages !
no , i must go on .
erich and his men are surrounded .
i must see von wirtz .
the telephones don' t work .
i could have died a hundred times on my way here .
that' s probably why erich sent me .
saddle a horse !
erich wouldn' t do that .
move !
i don' t blame him .
in his place , i' d have done the same .
i must go .
i' ve been offered a job .
i' il leave the army .
sophie , will you be my wife ?
it can' t be .
i thought so .
erich is very clever .
he takes the sister to get the brother .
you know what happened in riga ?
the broussaroff operation is a failure .
we still don' t know whether we' il be able to retreat .
what is it ?
what' s happening ?
why doesn' t anyone tell me ?
it' s over .
the end !
are you going out ?
i' m leaving .
where are you going ?
none of your business .
i realize that the life i' ve led until now
i' ve had enough !
i can' t go on !
your honor , your war , your " manly " friendships !
the war is only a pretext for your pleasure .
if that' s what you want , take a stable boy , but don' t use me as an alibi .
did volkmar tell you these stories ?
didn' t i say you' d despise me one day ?
i didn' t think you' d use konrad in all this .
streetwalkers shouldn' t pose as the vice squad .
paul is dead , too .
i know .
any news from your wife ?
she had a child .
in warsaw .
in the clinic .
she' s all right .
your second .
yes , two girls .
where are you going ?
i can' t tell you now .
erich has sent me .
i knew sophie well enough to know she' d never be seen again at kratovice .
but i was sure our paths would cross again one day .
even had i known the circumstances of our future encounter ,
i would have still just let her go .
four men !
search the house .
have you seen the countess ?
not for a long time .
not since last autumn .
think carefully .
when did you see her ?
i haven' t seen her .
what about this jacket ?
a peasant paid me with it .
no one here .
no arms ?
no arms .
get out .
some tea ?
no , thank you .
just a glass .
this is enough to arrest you .
the countess rested here thursday evening .
she left during the night .
why did she come ?
she wanted to see me .
was she pregnant ?
she' s not one of these peasant girls .
then tell me the real reason .
she needed some men' s clothes .
i couldn' t refuse .
she tried them on where you' re standing .
did she leave alone ?
she had a guide .
who ?
he has not returned .
where are they ?
if i knew , sir , i don' t think i' d tell you .
i alone fought her revolutionary ideas .
she knew all our plans .
she betrayed our operations to loew .
hence our defeat .
the inevitable failure of operation broussaroff , the surrender of kratovice .
no one could have suspected her .
what a perfect cover .
she' s not mata hari .
a radio message from riga .
they' re sending a train to marba .
sophie' s disappearance was enough to give this house , now bereft of women , the stillness of a monastery , and it soon reverted an outpost for german knights .
finally we could defend kratovice no longer , and we left for germany while the roads were still open .
stay here !
four of you go around back .
we' il divert their fire .
let' s go .
march !
out !
all of you !
the young lady .
take them away .
let' s go , on the double !
where are the others ?
who gives you orders ?
take off your cap !
was loew your leader ?
take him away .
get out !
the woman !
don' t expect information from me .
i' il say nothing .
i know nothing .
i didn' t bring you here to get information
but to clear some things up .
thank you .
you know neither side is taking prisoners .
i know .
i saw grigori' s mother .
she said you were married .
no .
but you slept together .
you thought i was engaged to volkmar .
i always told you everything .
grigori was very good to me .
i don' t know what i' d have become without him .
was it hard for you there ?
no , i was all right .
have you any family in germany ?
you want to take me back to germany ?
is that konrad' s idea , too ?
konrad is dead .
my condolences .
do you want to die , sophie ?
what will you do with the others ?
i' il do what i can for you .
i don' t expect that much .
you don' t want to owe me anything .
it' s not even that .
stop it .
it' s not like you .
the train was attacked on its way here .
it won' t be here until tomorrow .
give me a light !
take out the prisoners one by one .
on your knees !
she demands
the young lady requests
she' d like you to do it .
line up for a picture .
ready .
all aboard .
