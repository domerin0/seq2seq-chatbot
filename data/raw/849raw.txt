carol , did i ever tell you why i married her ?
yes , sam , you told me many , many
her father was very , very rich ... and very , very sick .
the doctors assured me he' d be dead any minute .
there wasn' t a second to lose .
i rushed right out and married the boss' s daughter .
he was so sick !
it was like the angel of death was sittin ' in the room with him , watchin ' the clock .
they pulled the plug on him .
he wheezed and shook for about an hour .
and then ... he stabilized .
that son of a bitch just got older and sicker .
and older and sicker !
and older and sicker !
more coffee , sir ?
no !
i couldn' t wait around any longer .
i went out and made my own fortune .
the old fart hung in there for 15 years !
finally died of natural causes .
i want the rest of that money !
his money , her money , it' s my money !
i had to live with that squealing , corpulent little toad all these years !
god , i hate that woman !

i hate her furniture .
and i hate that little sound she makes when she sleeps .
ohhh !
and that filthy , little shitbag dog of hers ...
muffy !
aren' t you scared ?
scared ?
hell , no .
i' m lookin ' forward to it .
my only regret , carol , is that the plan isn' t more violent .
don' t you consider throwing a body off a cliff in the dead of night violent ?

i' m talkin ' about hands on involvement .
hands on ?
ohh .

bye bye , barbara .
in local news , a kidnapping today in bel air .
police tell us this woman , barbara stone , the wife of clothing tycoon , sam stone , was abducted earlier today from the couple' s estate on bellagio drive .
preliminary sources indicated that mr. stone was contacted late this afternoon ... and that a ransom demand has been made .
police officials [ newscaster # 2 ]
... kill mrs. stone if demands were not met .
it' s on every goddamn channel !
millionaire heiress , barbara stone , has been kidnapped ... from her bel air mansion .
what' d he do , hire a publicist ?
i feel terrible .
do you feel as guilty as i do ?
guilty ?
are you kidding ?
he takes our money , steals your idea , goes out and makes a million dollars , and you feel guilty ?
i can' t believe it !
how many times have we been over this ?
oh , honey , not again .
let me remind you of something .
you are the spandex miniskirt king .
not him .
he is the spandex miniskirt thief .
he' s the one who should feel guilty .
look at this .
do you remember this ?
you cried for a week when you saw this .
look at the smile on that asshole .
i know he stole it , but she really didn' t do anything .
she was his partner !
oh , damn it , sandy .
do you enjoy getting stepped on ?
do you ?
' cause i don' t , and i don' t feel guilty .
i take it back .
i do feel guilty .
i feel very guilty .
i trusted a sleazeball like sam stone ... with our life savings on a handshake deal , and then sat there and watched him take it all away from us .
but that' s over .
we know better now .
from now on , we trust no one .
to hell with everybody else .
we' ve got to be ruthless .
think ruthless .
what if i can' t think ruthless ?
you' ve got to .
it' s good for you .
it makes you strong .
what the hell' s the sense of being a decent person when nobody else is ?
let' s be assholes and get rich !
oh , oh !
i' m crazy about you , you big galoot !
ooh , you were somethin ' today !
yeah , it just doesn' t get any better than this .
mmm .
i' m gonna take a quick shower .
can you be ready by the time i get out ?
ready ?
you' re getting ready for sam .
the video equipment , remember ?
tonight' s the night .
oh yeah , i knew that .
now , do you remember where i told you to go ?
yeah .
the old deserted bridge near the hollywood sign .
that' s right .
you wait for him there .
he' il be in some rented car .
he' s afraid of getting blood on his sports car .
get in as close as you can .
it' s important you get a good shot of his face .
if we can' t recognize him , we can' t blackmail him .
you get that videotape of sam finishing off his wife , and that man will give us anything we want ... for the rest of his life .
yeah , then we' re off to haiti .
not haiti , tahiti !
i knew that .
the passports came today .
cool .
frank , glad you' re here .
what have we got ?
we found a chloroform soaked handkerchief stuffed way down in the garbage , and a tire print on the lawn , a good one .
i' m having the lab check it out .
and we found a few drops of blood in the kitchen .
where' s mr. stone ?
he' s upstairs .
he seems pretty upset .
##
yes ?
mr. stone , lieutenant bender and walters are here .
they' d like to start as soon as possible .
i' il be right there .
ow !
oh , oh !
hee hee hee .
i like to hear a woman make a lot of sound .
uh huh .
i' il scream my head off if you want to , honey .
it' s your money .
my wife just lays there like a gunnysack .
oh , my god .
she isn' t dead yet .
he' s gonna kill her right here !
oh , oh .

i i' m a businessman .
i manufacture women' s sportswear .
i think i' ve heard of you .
don' t they call you the " spandex king " ?
the " spandex miniskirt king .
you probably read one of the articles .
yeah , it was all his idea ... spandex miniskirts .
was there anybody here today when you came home ?
servants ?
maids ?
it was the maid' s day off .
did you notice anything out of the ordinary when you came home ?
no , not that i can remember .
what time did you come home ?
it' s the dog !
she isn' t properly house trained .
no , it' s sweet .
the dog' s a little diabetic .
i think it' s wine ...
or  oh , i know what that must be .
i i closed a very important business deal ... this morning and when i came home ...
i opened a bottle of champagne and and as i was ... walking through the house , celebrating ,
i called to barbara to come and share the moment with me .
she never came .
those monsters !
earl !
it was horrible .
she wasn' t drugged or anything .
what happened ?
she screamed and screamed .
god , it took forever .
it must have lasted ... two minutes .
he kept stopping and starting .
she' d be at the brink of death and he' d stop ,
let her catch her breath then start into her again !
she' d scream louder and louder and then , when she finally died , he looked so satisfied i thought he was gonna light up a cigarette afterwards .
son of a bitch enjoyed it !
sam' s just been on tv claiming she was kidnapped .
she wasn' t kidnapped .
he killed her .
i saw it .
honey , i know .
it' s just an alibi .
he just said that to throw the police off his trail .
you gonna watch that right now ?
i think i should .
baby , you don' t wanna see it .
it' il make you sick .
i think i can take it .
oh , no !
ooh !

your dance card' il be filled every day .
you' il be so popular , making all kinds of new , close friends .
big , ugly hairy friends !

can i help you ?
yeah , uh
hi .
hi .
candy' s here to get a stereo , and i' m here to see she doesn' t get ripped off .
don' t worry , i' m not like the others .
how much did you want to spend ? $800 . $500 .
okay , i think i have an idea what to show you .
let' s start with speakers .
okay .
over here , we have a great speaker , sentry ev 1 .
consumer stereo has just rated this a best buy .
i have a pair myself .
yeah , uh , what do you think of this one ?
the dominator x 1 ?
the dominator' s a good marketing idea , but it' s really not a good speaker .
we give it a 500 % markup , so we sell it at 50 % off , give the customer the illusion he' s getting a deal , and we still make a bundle .
but it' s so big and impressive !
size means very little .
bigger is not necessarily better .
i sound like dr. ruth .
you mean the dominator' s like a , uh  well , the dominators are very popular with men who like to have bigger ... uh
equipment ?
exactly !
all right , let' s try this one .
knees bent down , hips tucked under .
we' re gonna work on the waist .
we' re gonna loosen it up .
take the arms left and right .
out , and reach as far as you can .
keep going .
okay , left .
this time hold it over to the left .
reach as far as you can .
reach the right arm up to it and take it out .
very slowly twist through the rib cage .
slowly lengthen , lift that right leg up and hold it .
aaah !
keep holding it .
great !
doesn' t that feel good ?
muffy ?
oh , muffy ?
muffy , meet adolph .
adolph , eat muffy !
bon appetit , adolph .
junk , garbage , garbage , junk .
what do we got here ?
oh ho ho .
i thought you might find this interesting .
an anonymous friend " .
more !
hello .
carol , i got your tape .
what are you talking about ?
the tape ... the videotape .
what makes you think it was me ?
who else would send me something like this ?
it' s sam .
he' s onto us .
how in the hell did you get this , carol ?
a friend of mine took it .
it' s terrific .
i know why you sent me this tape , honey .
and you know what i' m gonna do ?
i' m gonna do the same damn thing with you .
and you , too , could scream your brains out because no one' s gonna hear .
you are gonna be beggin ' me for mercy , whimpering .
oh , here she goes again .
listen to this .
this is my favorite part .
he' s gonna kill me .
he' s gonna torture me and kill me .
i can' t stay here .
i' m gonna have to stay ... at your place .
##
don' t worry , honey .
stay here as long as you want .
oh , shoot !
crockett and tubbs , they' re floatin ' .
i can' t just sit here and wait for him ... to track me down and kill me .
we' ve got to get sam put in jail .
i want you to make another copy of that tape , and this one' s for the police .
so , i guess it' s just a matter of time before you' re caught , right , honeybun ?
barbara , i want to ask you a personal question .
you and mr. stone , did you get along ?
so , what did she say ?
she just insulted me .
i don' t think he loves her .
let' s face it , she' s not mother teresa .
gandhi would have strangled her .
what are we gonna do , kenny ?
i' m tired of being scared all the time every day .
i can' t take this anymore .
i know he' s bluffing .
i just know it .
i' ve got to be really tough with him .
never let the seller know you' re hot to trot .
tell him you haven' t got the money .
hello .
debbie ?
yeah , debbie' s here .
who' s this ?
well , ralph , debbie can' t talk right now .
my dick' s in her mouth .
how ' bout if i have her call you back when i' m done .
i love wrong numbers .
anyway , tell ' em you don' t have the money , that it' s all tied up in investments or some crap .
hang on !
a bad salesman will automatically drop his price .
bad salesmen make me sick .
hello .
mr. stone , do you love your wife ?
hang on .
would you excuse me for a moment , please ?
oh , sure , mr. stone .
go ahead .
mr. stone , you love your wife , don' t you ?
sure , i love my wife .
mr. stone , we demand a satisfactory explanation ... why you haven' t shown with the money .
look , pal , you' re asking a lot of cash .
i haven' t got that kind of money around the house .
it' s all tied up in investments , so , uh , sorry .
sorry ?

no can do .

then the next time you see your wife , pal , will be in the morgue .
mr. stone , i have bad news .
we think we' ve found your wife .
we' il need you to come with us to identify the body .
that' s not her .
there must be some mistake .
we want the woman who was brought in this morning .
oh , jane doe 56 ?
she' s in the next room .
it looks like her , a lot like her .
but it' s not her .
my barbara !
she' s alive !

mr. kessler , over a week ago ... a lady named barbara stone was kidnapped from her bel air home .
are you familiar with the case ?
yeah , i read about it .
we believe the vehicle the kidnappers used left a tire print in her driveway .
we took a mold of that print , had our lab analyze it , and the results were rather interesting .
these are the prints of the kidnapper' s car , and these are the prints of your car .
is there a phone i can use ?
uh , sure , it' s right over there on the desk .
amazing similarity !
would you excuse me for a second ?
i' ve got to go to the bathroom .
i' ve got a touch of the stomach flu .
sure , go right ahead .
chloroform ?
what about fingerprints ?
bingo !
we have a winner .
you won' t believe this .
they found evidence implicating stone .
stone ?

chloroform and fingerprints .
i' il be damned .
let' s get out of here .
where' s kessler ?
in the john .
stomach flu .
mr. kessler ?
i' il b be right out .
don' t bother , sir .
thank you for your help .
we' il just show ourselves out .
hello .
all right , mr. stone .
we came very close to killing your wife , but she begged us repeatedly for just one more chance .
so in the spirit of compassion and mercy , we decided not to kill her just yet .
compassion and mercy ?
what the hell' s going on over there ?
i thought you people were ruthless !
we are , mr. stone .
then what' s this phone call about ?
we called to make you an offer ,
an offer even you can' t refuse .
oh ?
yeah .
10, 000 .
fat chance !
mr. stone , this is no joke !
we' re desperate people .
i believe this is a joke , pal , and you' re it .
the last time we spoke , you said my wife would be ... in the morgue if i didn' t pay .
well , i didn' t pay and today i was at the morgue .
she wasn' t there .
you lied to me .
you know what i think of you ?
no .
you got no nuts !
what do i have to do ?
put a gun in your hand , aim , and pull your finger down , you spineless wimp ?
i dare you to kill her !
now that oughta do it .
hey , you ?
wanna sell me a stereo ?
yeah , i' il sell you a stereo .
all right .
i' m lookin ' for something real hot .
i don' t wanna get ripped off , you know ?
okay .
you' re looking for some real hot speakers , right ?
i' m not talking about something you just listen to .
i' m talking about the kind of sound you can feel .
yeah !
you know what i mean .
yeah !
when it comes to great stereo , you can' t beat big speakers .
i' m talking about big speakers with big woofers like this .
you can get this .
it has a nice little eight inch woofer , or this ten incher .
over here we have a nice big 12 inch .
but i can tell by the look on your face , man , you want something even bigger .
fuck , yeah !
" fuck , yeah " is right .
we gotta go to the big room for this !
the big room !
check it out , my man .
the flagship of the entire dominator line .

30 inches of thigh slappin ' , blood pumpin ' nuclear brain damage !
bitchin ' !

that' s the bitchin ' part about it .
it don' t matter .
if you can' t afford it , fuckin ' finance it !
## [ loud hard rock ]
yeah !
whoo !
so what if it' s as big as a subaru and costs as much !
you' il never have to trade this in .
this is gonna be with you for the rest of your life .
and when you die , they can bury you in it !
i want it !
this guy is okay .
first guy i feel i can really trust .

whew , i' m pooped .
let' s take a break .
take a break ?
come on , you little wimp !
let' s go !
here' s your lunch .
it' s fruit salad .
you seem to like that the most , although you still don' t eat as much as you should .
my body' s become a more efficient machine .
i go farther with less food .
you must be in pretty good shape by now .
you certainly look good .
you' ve lost a lot of weight .

oh , yeah , you' ve lost a lot of weight , at least 20 pounds .

i' ve been to ... ten different fat farms in ,
god , i don' t know how many years .
and i lost a total , a total of six pounds .
i have lost 20 pounds !
i wasn' t sure , but ... it felt thin .
you wouldn' t have a never mind .
a a what ?
no , no , no .
it' s very silly .
no , what ?
please tell me .
all my life i wanted to have a slinky little figure ... so i could wear some bill blass or valentino , some exotic evening gown like christian dior , jerry galanos .
are you kidding me ?
you' re kidding me , aren' t you ?
i' m sorry .
i know it' s ridiculous to think that somebody of your ,
well , moderate means  i' il be right back .
just don' t go anywhere .
sam stone ?
yeah ?
mr. stone , you' re under arrest .
for mixing cotton with silk ?
this is absolutely beautiful !
whose design is this ?
is this bill blass ?
albert nipon ?
nah , too conventional .
halston ?
i know who did it .
oscar de la renta .
i designed it .
get outta here !
really ?
wow !
you' re a professional .
nah .
you are !
this is sensational .
do you have any more ?
wait !
# i won' t do you no harm no #
# you' ve got to be all mine all mine #
# ooh , foxy lady #
# foxy #
so , sam told you i was his partner ?
no way !
he was just passing the buck .
oh , god .
so , when do i get out of here ?
as soon as mr. stone pays the ransom .
what' s the problem ?
what is the ransom ?
it , it was $500, 000 .
that shouldn' t be a problem .
he complained .
he complained ?
and then we dropped our price to $50, 000 .
yeah ?
he didn' t pay .
he didn' t pay ?
so now what ?
so now ... we' re dropping our price again to $10, 000 .
do i understand this correctly ?
i' m being marked down ?
what is this ?
the bargain basement ?
i' ve been kidnapped by kmart !
don' t cry , barbara .
hey , check it out .
you sure got a pretty mouth .
all right , stone , let' s go .
hey , was it something i said ?
yeah .
although this is a capital crime , the accused is an upstanding member of the community , a responsible and successful businessman ... and has never before posed a threat to society .
bail will be granted and set at ...
$700, 000 .
you want to try for a reduction ?
no , pay the ticket and let' s get the hell out of here .
that filthy slug !
that screeching little witch !
that pasty faced troll !
the judge ?
my wife !
i gotta get her back !
sandy ?
kenny ?
it' s over .
sam isn' t going to pay the ransom .
he couldn' t care less .
i' m no criminal .
i can' t even sell retail ... and that' s legal .
we gotta get packing and get outta here .
oh , kenny !
i' ve got some very interesting news for you .
i am the new rising star ...
in high fashion !
let' s get a grip on ourselves .
try to be calm .
we' re going down to mexico for a couple of years .
we can camp on the beach .
does that mean we let barbara go ?
we' re not going to take her with us .
good .
' cause i' ve already let her go .
what ?
you let her go ?
oh , my god !
you didn' t let her just run right out of here ?
yeah !
oh , my god !
why not ?
she knows where we live .
she' il turn us in .
the police will be here .
you don' t understand .
she really likes us now .
i showed her my gowns .
she loves them .
we' re all going into business together .
we' re gonna open our fall line in paris .
she told you this ?
yes .
she really , truly loves me .
she can be trusted .
she' s changed !
changed ?
what' d you do ?
perform an exorcism ?
ken , she lost nearly 20 pounds .
well , you just had to be there .
it was a very special moment .
i' m surprised they knocked .
good afternoon .
we' re wondering if you' ve seen this man .
he was sighted in the area a few weeks ago and then again this morning .
he' s psychotic , extremely dangerous and violent .
he' s killed half a dozen people .
i gotta get outta here .
my wife , she' s late for work .
doesn' t look familiar .
keep this and give us a call at this number in case you do see him .
under no circumstances should you try to subdue him yourself .
he' s extremely violent .
he looks it .
thank you very much , officer .
sandy ?
it' s okay .
it' s okay !
they' re looking for somebody else .
i' il get the other suitcase from the basement .
hello ?
hello ?
anybody home ?
oh , hello .
are you a friend of ken and sandy' s ?
you ...
look like my mother .
i hate my mother .
no .
you you look just like my father .
i hate my father !
jesus .
what the hell was that ?
honey , don' t touch him .
oh , my god .
it' s the bedroom killer .
he told me i look like his mother .
he hates his mother .
he' s dead .
so , if i look like his mother ... and you look like his father , this is what our son would look like .
pretty strong argument for birth control .
what do we do now ?
barbara , what are you doing here ?
i got it !
i tell you , i' ve got it .
listen to this .
all right .
sam arrives on a motorcycle wearing shorts , no shoes , no shirt , nothing .
maybe we' il just put him in a jockstrap .
we send him all over town in the middle of a hot , sunny day .
sam burns real easily .
he' il be bright red .
i can' t believe this is happening .
then he' s got to cover himself with honey and go to a bee farm .
we make him dance so the bees go absolutely nuts !
i don' t think she really
then we all watch while they sting him to death !
yeah !
don' t we want a punishment that' il keep stinging him the rest of his life ?
my god , he must' ve been seeing this woman for years .
castrate him !
i want to castrate him .
wouldn' t it be better if we struck at the core of sam' s being ,
his reason for living ?
what would that be ?
his testicles !
would you know in complete detail what sam' s total net worth would be , not just the big stuff , the little stuff too , down to the last penny ?
yeah ...
i think so .
good .
i want you to write it down in as much detail as you can .
fire up the stove .
get the tofu burgers from the freezer .
we' re calling sam .
my tux , my silk tux .
et tu , adolph ?
et tu ?
hello ?
hi , sam .
oh , thank god it' s you !
i' ve been thinking about your last offer .
i think you' re right .
i cannot refuse . $10, 000 is fair and totally acceptable .
she' s in bad shape , sam .
we' ve been torturing her .
aaah !
aaah !
don' t kill her !
we found out your wife is worth quite a bit more than $10, 000 .
what do you mean ?
we changed our minds .
we' ve upped the ransom .
to what ?
we' re up to $2 million . $2 million ?
you outta your fucking mind ?
where' d you get an incredible figure like that ?
oh , you' d be surprised at the quality and quantity ... of information a lit cigarette can provide .
what else ?
shh !
gems !
he' s got rare gems in the safe .
oh , sam , forgive me .
what kind of gems ?
how many ?
i don' t know .
aaah !
aaah !
four flawless one karat diamonds !
the bitch blabbed .
apparently , you got a million two built up in equity on sam' s sportswear , another 350, 000 in your pension plan .
general dynamics closed at 75 and 3/ 4 today , which brings another 175, 000 to the party .
45, 000 for the excalibur and now there' s the four one karat diamonds in the safe .
you inhuman slime !
after his release yesterday ,
mr. stone continued to deny the charges ... despite what the district attorney' s office insists is overwhelming evidence .
overwhelming evidence is right !
what more do they want ?
how could they let him go ?
hello ?
hello .
it' s me again .
i see sam stone' s been released .
it' s not easy keeping a man in jail with these liberal courts .
a man is innocent until proven guilty .
well , how do you think these courts would feel ...
if i gave that tape to the media ?
oh , my ...
god .
yeah !
they' d go crazy for it .
they love to show sick stuff like that .
it' d probably be on national tv 24 hours a day for weeks !
i bet that' d get a hell of a reaction .
please , please don' t do that .
where' s your sense of compassion ?
why do you have to be so vicious ?
vicious ?
have you seen that tape ?
come on !
what' s the big deal ?
it' s just a lonely man who wanted a little excitement .
that kind of thing happens every day .
everybody does it !
i don' t believe this .
i don' t believe you said that !
men get the urge .
we' re only human .
you' re sick .
hello ?
no , don' t hang up on me !
so , what' d he say ?
something strange is happening here .
either the chief is a complete moron , and complete morons are rare , or he' s playing games with me .
we better find someplace where we can look at that tape .
this is perfect .
it is ?
give me the tape .
okay .
ho , ho ho !
you idiot !
this isn' t sam .
and he isn' t killing her .
that' s my husband !
barbara really was kidnapped .
she really was kidnapped !
i didn' t kill her .
please believe me .
you gotta be there .
they' re coming this time for sure .
i think the deli' s using a different mustard .
the last time it was tangier .
jesus christ !
i' m pleading for my life ... and you' re discussing the inconsistency of lunch meat condiments !
haven' t you heard a word i' ve said ?
god !
i' m sorry , mr. stone , but since the house is in your wife' s name , as well as her other 15 million in assets , you' re not legally entitled to it as long as your wife is alive .
however , you' ve got a million two built up in equity in your business , another 350, 000 in your pension plan .
you' d have no problem using that as collateral .
all right .
let' s do it !
hello ?
sam ?
carol !
where the hell have you been ?
i' ve called you 100 times .
sam , i miss you .
how have you been ?
i' m going crazy over this kidnapping thing .
and the cops won' t do a damn thing to help me .
why ?
they don' t believe me .
they think i made up the kidnapping .
they won' t even show up at the ransom drop to see if i' m telling the truth !
you' re gonna be all by yourself ?
that' s terrible .
how much money is it ? $2 . 2 million .
cash ?
of course it' s cash .
have you ever heard of a kidnapper taking a check ?
where are you going to give them the money ?
i mean , i , i hope it isn' t dangerous .
i' ve gotta go to a phone booth ... on hope street plaza .
hello ?
sam !
it' s so nice to hear your voice .
how' s muffy ?
listen , sam , we don' t have much time .
there' s a gun pointed at my head .
they' re making me give the ransom instructions in case the police are listening .
you must make sure there are no police , otherwise they' il kill me .
nope .
no cops .
now , have you got all the money ? $2 . 2 million in unmarked , nonsequential bills ?
you miserable scum sucking pig !
oh , honey , i' m so sorry .
they made me say that .
yeah , i got all the money .
it' s there in the briefcase ?
you scumbag !
you lowlife motherfucker !
oh dear .
they made me say that too .
it' s in the case , yeah .
the rolex too ?
the gold rolex ?
who said anything about the rolex ?
they never mentioned the rolex .
they want the rolex and your pinkie ring !
honey , they tortured me with cigars .
i had to tell them everything .
all right .
what else ?
that' s it !
just wait there .
bag , please .
come on , give me the bag !
freeze !
put the bag down and put your hands on your head .
bender !
they' re from the government .
they' re here to help you .
i said no police .
do you know what this means ?
stay back .
they touch me and i give the order to kill !
got it ?
leave me alone or she' s a dead woman .
you want her blood on your hands ?
what do you think ?
let' s just follow him home .
okay , let him go .
what ?
what are you doing ?
gimme it !
let go .
tell him to let go .
if he doesn' t let go i give the order .
go ahead , give the order .
let go !
she' s a dead woman if he doesn' t !
all right , drop it .
punk .
hello ?
hello ?
this is lt. bender .
what are you doing ?
i' m taking my money .
you got your man .
the rest is your problem .
mr. stone , you may be guilty of obstructing justice , aiding and abetting a felon , accomplice to kidnapping and possibly murder .
my advice to you is to drop the gun , give back the bag .
we have 150 officers , 75 cars and two helicopters .
he won' t get away .
that' s better .
here !
what are you doing here ?
tell them to get out of here !
if they don' t go , she' s dead !
all right , gentlemen , clear the street , please .
you too , mr. stone .
back away .
that' s better .
you can go now .
don' t follow me .
understand ?
we understand .
don' t move !
who the hell are you ?
what the hell is going on ?
i' m robbing you !
stop him !
did you shoot at me ?
no , you moron .
there' s police all over .
hundreds of ' em !
do i look that stupid ?
yes , you do !
if you shot at me , where' s your gun ?
well , you' re too sharp for me !
you got me figured out .
i don' t have one .
that was a brand new tire .
give me your keys .
i don' t believe this !
give the bag to bozo , drop the gun and put your hands in the air .
who said that ?
this could very well be the stupidest person on the face of the earth .
perhaps we should shoot him .
it' s the police department .
really ?
no !
we' re the national rifle association !
christ !
i' m leaving now .
they said they wouldn' t follow me .
# hey #
# stand up #
# ruthless people #
# watch yourself #
# hey #
# stand up #
# ruthless people #
# ruthless people #
# you can have it if you want it #
# it might take the rest of your life #
# if you want it you can have it #
# ruthless people # they' re still following me .
i should have known .
i knew this wouldn' t work .
you can' t trust the police !
oh , god .
oh ... boy .
he' s cornered and he knows it .
i hope he doesn' t hurt anybody .
i' m not going to jail !
i' m not going to jail !
oh , my god !
hey , look out !
watch it !
somebody help !
he' il drown !
the water' s way too cold .
there' s riptides .
i' ve seen sharks .
somebody call an ambulance .
look there !
that' s money !
my money !
let' s get the coast guard and fish him out .
you can' t do that !
that' s not your money !
that' s my money !
stop ' em !
aaah !
the bedroom killer !
what about the money ?
they recovered a few thousand dollars .
the rest washed away .
he said if anything went wrong , they' d kill barbara .
things couldn' t have gone more wrong than this , could they ?
that means she' s dead .
mrs. stone !
i' il be damned !
mrs. stone ?
yes .
i' m lt. walters .
we' re glad to see you' re okay .
i' m sorry to have to ask you to do this right now , but i' m afraid we need you to identify the body .
yes !
that' s him !
oh , i could never forget that face .
what hell he put me through .
you' re sure he worked alone ?
positive .
he mentioned a partner .
he was schizophrenic .
he thought he had partners .
where' s sam ?
he' s over there , mrs. stone .
would you excuse me for a moment ?
i' d just like to be alone with my husband .
certainly .
thank you .
hello , sam .
barbara !
you look terrific !
you think so ?
i mean ,
you' re so thin .
really ?
does it show ?
i mean , you' re beautiful !
oh , sam !
oh , barbara !
i hope my marriage is as strong as theirs after 15 years .
i can' t believe we doubted stone' s affection for his wife .
we almost blew it .
thank god she' s alive .
ol ' buddy , you work , you put in long hours .
it' s a tough beat .
but it all seems worth it when you get a moment like this .
yeah , i love a happy ending .
barbara !
