i don' t know , it' s ...

we should probably call the zoo and ...

no zoos .
you know i don' t like the idea of animals in cages .
honey , neither do i , but let' s just see what we got here .
let' s ...
i gotta think about this .

tucker , come out here and meet our guest .
i' m coming .
i swear , franny , the funnier looking the animal ... ... the more you wanna keep it .

good question .
i don' t know .
okay , we can rule out genius .
don' t make me chew open a can of pony whup .
save the sweet talk for later .
don' t pay any attention to him .
listen , he' s all whinny and no bite .
i' m franny , this is reggie , and mr. sensitive here is tucker .
and that old goat there is an old goat .
it' s the chief .
you used to be so nice .
yeah , i know , but i got over it .
why do you have to be such a horse' s ... ?
well , let' s just get you dried off first , all right ?
he' s got real strong legs .
he' s quite the little athlete .
hey , buddy .
why don' t you grab the milk and see if he' il come to you .
come here , boy .
come on .
come on .
come on .
there you are .
come on , boy .
come on .
attaboy .
welcome to your new home , stripes .
stripes ?
well , " spot " doesn' t work , now , does it ?
you like that name , don' t you ?
stripes .
well , i' il take that as a yes .
good morning , walsh farm !
well , i know it' s not glamorous , but it' s a living .
keeps my head on my shoulders , which is more than i can say for my cousins .
simmer down there , lightning .
hey , hey , slow down .
boy , oh , boy .
kids these days , no control .
now , back in my day ...
oh , here we go again with the ancient history lesson .
enough .
now we' re in for it .
and the horses are entering the starting gates .
oh , what is that ?
that is the only reason for a horse to live , kid .
it' s called a racetrack .
oh , there' s more to life than running around in a circle .
well , maybe to you .
humans race , horses race .
there was even a chicken run , but there' s never been a goat race .
ever , ever , ever .
get the picture , franny ?
could i race ?
it' s complicated .
it takes a lot of work to become a racehorse .
what' s a racehorse ?
they' re the greatest .
once a year , there' s a big race to see who' s the best .
by the way , the horses that won every year were the ones we trained .
why did you quit ?
lxnay on the other may .
say what you mean .
we haven' t spoken latin since the pigs left .
oh , all right .
a few years ago , the girl' s mother had an accident .
yeah .
her horse stumbled and neither one of them could be saved .
the chief couldn' t bear to train after that .
and neither did we .
hey , look , they' re ready to go .
how come none of them have stripes ?
you take this one .
thanks .
just unlucky , i guess .
and they' re off .
flash of thunder' s ...
look at them .
look at them run .
watch me , i' m a racehorse .
well , would you look at him ?
he loves to run .
it' s in his heart .
but that' s not enough .
you could train him .
then it would be enough .
let me tell you something .
the legs are too short , the head' s too big .
he' s got as much chance to race as me .
besides , i have got better things to do .
oh , go fix your hair .
i heard that .
watch me , i' m in the big race .
excuse me .
racehorse coming through .
whoa , look at that .
come on .
dude , i' m right with you .
whoa , nice mohawk .
that' s funny .
mohawk .
what' s a mohawk ?
shut up , you idiot .
you guys train to race ?
yeah , you want a taste ?
ready , set , go .
catch me if you can .
hey , i wasn' t ready .
come on , you slowpoke !
yeah !
i' m not even in second gear yet .
yeah , he' s not even in second gear yet .
last one to the fence is a donkey .
dude , it' s your dad .
great .
son .
stay away from that fence .
come on , dad .
we were just having some fun .
fun is overrated .
if you' re going to be a champion , i suggest you start acting like one .
oh , your dad scares me , dude .
not me .
pride !
ruffshodd !
coming , father .
yeah , coming , mr. sir trenton , sir .
i don' t understand .
why won' t he let them play with me ?
you' re just different .
and for some horses , different is scary .
come on , he' s never late .
i' m all ready to go .
where is he ?
oh , here he comes .
bring it on .
show me what you got .
here we go .
better luck tomorrow !
dang !
i had him today .
she' s just not right today , mr. cooper .
yep .
better give her a break .
okay .
you call that jumping ?
looked like she was having a seizure .
sorry , miss dalrymple .
she seemed a bit shy on the high jump ... ... so i thought i' d take it easy .
of course you did .
but , you know , the thing is , i don' t pay you to take it easy .
i pay you to train .
you can only push a horse so hard .
cooper , cooper , cooper .
why must you be so tedious ?
okay , here' s the deal .
now , as long as i am signing your checks , you will push her as hard as i tell you to .
don' t you have a board meeting at the track to get to ?
as a matter of fact , i do .
yo , yo , pride .
check out the new filly .
what a mane .
look at those flanks .
watch .
she' s gonna come straight for me .
do i have anything in my teeth ?
you always have something in your teeth , ruffshodd .
hey , where' s she going ?
excuse me .
would you care to join me for a drink ?
a drink .
good call .
no .
talk to the tail , boys .
did you ever consider going around that tree instead of through it ?
yeah , well , usually it moves out of my way .
i' ve never heard of a tree doing that .
you don' t know the trees here .
are you new ?
just got here .
i' m sandy .
i' m stripes .
you don' t say ?
are you a racehorse ?
no , i' m a jumper .
i' ve actually competed all around the world .
well , i' m a racehorse .
i' m training to be in the big race .
by racing the mailman ?
well , the other horses don' t wanna race me .
i' m just way too fast for them .
he' s not a racer .
oh , not them again .
they say his dad' s a horse and his mom' s a fence .
real funny , guys .
i' ve gotta go , i' m sorry .
i' il see you around , stripes ?
later .
so , stripey , how' s it going ?
you still racing the mailman ?
oh , the mailman wasn' t racing him .
he was running away from him .
i' il race you any time you want .
well , unfortunately i don' t race nobodies .
yeah , he don' t race nobodies .
figures .
all talk and no action .
well , this is disappointing .
oh , it' s my dad .
listen , you .
i want you to stop bothering my son .
and you can tell tucker i said that .
trenton' s pride is a champion with a real future .
and you , well ...
you have your place .
father , i ...
you and i will talk later .
mr. sir trenton , sir , we been trying to get this guy to stop bothering us ... ... but he just won' t stop ...
ruffshodd . ... bothering us .
shut up , you idiot .
yes , mr. sir trenton , sir .
and may i say , your coat is very shiny today .
there' s a place where we can settle this .
no humans .
no rules .
where and when ?
welcome to the blue moon races .
yeah !
it' s him .
be quiet .
be quiet .
tonight' s first contestant is 10 0 and good to go .
he is the baddest pony on the prairie .
give it up for trenton' s pride .
step right up , if you' re horse enough .
not me , no way .
who' s feeling their oats ?
nobody can beat him .
no way .
he' s too tough .
i' il take him on .
laugh it up .
just wait and see .
hey , sandy .
hi , stripes .
well , well .
i' m surprised you showed up .
you wanna talk or race ?
that coat is simply dreadful .
well , it' s slimming , though .
right ?
oh , you' re gonna wish you stayed home .
you' re gonna wish i stayed home too .
after i kick your butt .
and now , let' s get ready to ... ... race !
up to that heap , around it and back to here .
i am going to make you look so bad in front of your girlfriend .
send him home , pride .
show him who' s boss .
you got guts , kid .
come on , pride .
you show him who' s in charge .
let' s go !
come on , stripey , try and keep up .
see you , loser .
just giving you a head start .
you' re gonna need it .
come on , pride , is that all you got ?
i' m not even breaking a sweat yet .
good thing your daddy' s not here to see this .
holy cow , what a kick .
at least you' re gonna keep this interesting .
i told you guys he' s fast .
slow down , kid , you' re gonna blow the turn .
stripes !
nice turn , stripey .
i tried to warn you .
how' s that ridge taste ?
what can you say ?
rookie mistake .
stripes , are you all right ?
go back where you belong !
yeah , i' m fine .
what a loser !
get out of here !
stripes .
we don' t want you .
go home !
hey , stripey .
did you really think that you could beat a trained professional ?
hey there , boy .
what' s up ?
what' s the matter ?
feel like there' s something you' re not telling me .
what , you sick or something ?
there you are .
now you' re all gorgeous again .
i can' t have my best boy looking all gnarly , now , can i ?
stay out of the mud .
so you don' t know where the mud came from ?
it didn' t come from the blue moon races ?
nope , just took a mudbath for my arthritis .
chan !
helmet .
take it easy .
i' m gonna be late for work .
yeah , that' s right .
boy , will you get a load of this dump ?
even old macdonald wouldn' t want this farm , but it' s perfect .
miles from the jersey shore , not an ocean in sight , not even a birdbath .
no one will look for a classy guy like the goose here .
watch where you' re going , that' s my knee .
so that' s how we land in the big city .
if there' s no parking space , you make one .
any of you mugs got a problem with that ?
nice landing .
can we see you take off now ?
are you a small horse or some sort of an ass ?
because you look like an ass to me .
i don' t mean to be rude ... ... but you seem to be more surf than turf .
did you take a wrong turn ?
because you look slow , i' il skip the salad and get to the risotto .
let' s just say i' m having a little disagreement with my family .
we disagree on whether or not they should whack me .
name' s goose .
oh , a pelican named goose .
well , my name' s duck .
duck ?
duck ?
duck .
goose .
oh , you' re funny .
but there' s only room for one wise guy on this farm , and you should know ... ... goose is a name that strikes fear into anyone on the east coast .
don' t shoot !
i didn' t do it !
it was the horse with the funny hair .
the goat' s in on it .
you' re fine unless you' re being chased by a tractor .
look , here' s the whole spaghetti sauce .
i' m a hit bird , and when sammy the gull needs a lesson taught ... ... the goose is the guy he calls .
only this last job , i had a little mishap .
instead of hitting freddy the flamingo , i hit sammy' s capo , johnny storkanado .
and now sammy , freddy , johnny , they' re all after me .
hey , ever try shutting up ?
ever try swimming in cement horseshoes ?
i' ve taken out punks bigger than you .
what , you talk them to death ?
careful , pony boy , or somebody' s gonna wake up with your head in their bed .
knew from that pecker you' d be a bigmouth .
watch it , stumpy .
i' d cut you off at the knees , but it looks like somebody' s beaten me to it .
all right , knock it off .
nobody has anything to prove here .
proof ?
you want proof , huh ?
you see rusty the rotating rooster up there ?
he' s about to get goosed .
where is hunting season when you need it ?
okay , adjust for the wind .
nice , level flight .
come on , goose , use the force .
well , you can' t say that he couldn' t hit the broadside of a barn door .
acid rain !
acid rain !
i' m blind .
it' s too late for me .
save yourselves .
i' m going to the light .
i see a bucket of dead relatives !
extra crispy .
extra crispy !
that' s the worst turn i' ve ever seen anybody make .
awful , terrible , stink o .
i have no idea what you' re talking about .
the blue moon races are the worst kept secret of all time .
i know .
i almost had him .
i should have beaten him , easily .
wrong .
you need more than raw talent , which you have ... ... to beat a well trained racehorse .
it takes skill .
real skill and real discipline to become a racer .
it' s hard work .
nothing good ever comes easy .
and speaking of hard work ...
oh , boy .
see you later , kid .
good luck .
tractor' s down , stripes .
yeah , it' s time to earn your keep .
yeah .
there you go .
easy , take it easy .
yeah , good boy .
there you go .
come on , now .
come on , stripes , just give it a little more .
little more .
it' s gonna be over that much quicker .
come on , now .
come on .
come on .
hey , sweetness .
look at your bigtime racehorse now .
yeah , bigtime .
check it out .
hey , plow boy , you missed a spot !
why don' t you guys go choke on an apple .
come on , darling , don' t go getting your tail in a knot .
talk to me .
you look frustrated , what' s the matter ?
what is it gonna take for me to get to the track so i can have another shot ?
i won' t blow sun up your tail .
you' re from the wrong side of the fence .
the only chance you' ve got is ...
forget it , forget it , forget it .
no .
what ?
what were you gonna say ?
you gotta get someone to ride you so you can show them .
a human ?
no , we' re gonna strap ... ... reggie to your back .
of course a human .
so if you do get to race , you' il be ready .
and pulling that thing can only help .
put your back into it .
get to work .
yeah .
i will make it to the track , tucker .
and when i do , i' m gonna beat pride and win the big race .
whoa , big fella !
that' s the attitude .
you can put your boots in the oven , but that won' t make them biscuits .
good boy .
good boy .
you did all right , huh .
yeah .
good boy .
hey , there' s my best boy .
been working you hard , hasn' t he ?
i' il see you later .
all right .
i need to find a way to get rid of you .
that could be arranged .
who are you ?
name' s goose .
always looking to do a favor for someone that' s been in the joint .
when' d you get out ?
out of where ?
the pokey , the do right ranch , the iron bar inn .
come on , you can level with me .
what are you talking about ?
oh , you' re good .
yes , you are , you are very good .
so where did you do your stretch ?

look , how can you help ?
all right , listen up , you glue factory rejects .
professor goose is gonna school youse in how to take out a motorcycle .
class is now in session .
will we be tested on this ?
stuff it , mcnugget .
rule number one , we never say nothing .
even when tortured , not a word gets out .
watch this .
look out !
freddy the flamingo' s right behind you .
hey , goose .
all right , i' il talk , i' il talk .
it was vito .
vito pelligrino from pier 9 .
what do you know ?
goose , who was really a pelican , is really a stool pigeon ... ... who is actually a chicken that ducks .
that makes five birds in one , count them .
i' m no chicken .
mind you , i got nothing against chickens .
i mean , some of my best friends are chickens .
fowl are fine folks .
all right , let' s go , it' s time .
now , you guys stay here .
this ain' t gonna be pretty .
oh , boy , now what do i do ?
all right , tough guy , we can do this the easy way or the hard way .
gentlemen , don' t let the feathers fool you , this dude' s dangerous .
he' s a killing machine disguised as an idiot .
hey , you like that ?
huh ?
right in the seat .
okay , lights out .
turning up the pain .
you like that ?
come on , can you hear me ?
oh , a spitter , huh ?
oh , you wanna dance ?

karate chop a !

you call the goose , and ba da bing .
ba da boom .
this is reggie redrooster with the farm report .
in sports news , goose the pelican dropped the motorcycle in the first round .
then , for good measure , taught the truck a lesson as well .
move it along , nothing to see here .
i' m gonna be late for work .
well , you can take old blue .
oh , that' s just great .
oh , come on .

no .
come on , i have to get to work .
can i take him , please ?
honey , no .
besides , i' d never be able to get a saddle on him .
all right , so i got a saddle on him , big deal .
not like he' s gonna let you ride him .
you don' t know him like i do .
well ... ... even if he does let you , you know how i feel .
i' ve been riding since i was 5 .
that' s not the point .
come on .
i mean , it' s almost like he wants to be ridden .
oh , honey .
honey , come on .
just let me try .
come on , come on .
careful .
now we' re talking .
talking to who ?
what you been talking about ?
you been training stripes , haven' t you ?
just nice and easy .

we don' t want you !
nobody asked you here , freak !
yeah , no freaks allowed .
i' il see you later , buddy .

those guys aren' t so fast .
i can take them .
scuzz , how can you ruin a great song like that ?
oh , come on , man !
that song' s already ruined .
those aren' t even the words .
the words don' t matter , man !
you know " you can' t touch this , " the rest of it' s gold .
okay , smart boy , just go fly yourself into a fan .
now , come on , let' s go get some food .
just follow me .
waiter !
table for one , please .
hey , why don' t you take a closer look .
i' il tell mom !
scuzz , i don' t believe it .
i got 20 million brothers and sisters ... ... and mom tells me that i gotta look out for you .
well , that' s because it' s easy , dumb dumb .
nothing bad ever happens to me !
scuzz , you know what ?
bad is the only thing that happens to you !
hey , pull my wing .
no .
it' s not like before .
i promise , nothing will happen .
never , never fall for that .
it' s too easy !
who does that thing belong to ?
he' s mine , miss dalrymple .
i had no other way of getting here .
i' il go put him in the stables .
yes , and from now on ... ... you will leave him at that petting zoo you and your father so laughably call a farm .
this is a racetrack , dear , not the serengeti .
you don' t know the words to that either .
i can make up a rap about anything .
hey .
hey , what' s that ?
well , that' s obvious .
it' s the racetrack referee .
buzz , check this out .
hey , pal , why the long face ?
thank you !
" why the long face ?
still got it !
what are you doing ?
look .
you' re a horse !
you all have long faces , get it ?
it' s a joke !
i' ve heard all the jokes .
the others have been making fun of me since i was born .
i know i' m different .
you think you had it rough ?
you try starting out life as a maggot .
nobody wants to pet a little maggot .
nobody .
scuzz , scuzz , scuzz .
come on , now .
easy .
seriously , what' s with the stripes ?
are you making some kind of statement ?
i never seen a black horse with white stripes .
you dimwit !
he is obviously a white horse with black stripes !
now , anybody could see that .
guys , look out !
are we dead ?
are we dead ?
well , if we are ... ... buzz , we' re in heaven !
here comes your open winner , miss d.
yes , well , he better be , mr. cooper .
anything less than a victory , and you' il be back shoveling manure .
see you , woodzie .
night , ken .
what are you doing , boy ?
we shouldn' t be out here .
i know , boy .
i feel it too .
when i was little ... ... my mama used to bring me out here at around this time .
put me on the saddle behind her ... ... take me once around the track .
it was like magic .
come on , boy !
come on !
go !
let' s go , boy !
easy , boy .
come on .
attaboy .
easy does it .
good boy .
channing !
hold on a second .
woodzie .
you' re not gonna tell anyone , are you ?
mum' s the word .
well , who' s your friend ?
some turn of foot .
this is stripes .
he' s quick , huh ?
i' il say .
like to get a watch on him for real .
dad doesn' t want me to ride , let alone race .
well , that' s a crime .
you move just like your mom .
god rest her soul .
and not even a proper saddle .
a trainer friend of mine' s working some horses in the time trial tomorrow .
why don' t you come out early and join in .
yeah , you think about it .
hey .
forget where the house is ?
miss dalrymple made me stay late .
i can' t stand her .
don' t give me excuses .
and don' t take it out on her .
if anything , you should pity her .
she sees a horse , she doesn' t see beauty .
she just sees business .
i don' t see how you ever worked for her .
she' s such a pain .
i let most of it go in one ear and out the other .
it was worth it .
i got a chance to work with some mighty fine horses .
we could do it again , you know .
chan ...
dad ... ... everybody says you' re still the best .
we just need a few horses to get us started .
then we could put old dalrymple out to pasture .
that' s in the past , honey .
i fixed the flat .
you can take blue to work tomorrow .
but i wanna ride stripes .
he was great , dad .
you should' ve seen him !
that was a one shot deal .
you know how i feel .
what about how i feel ?
discussion' s over .
but , dad ...
i said no , chan .
you are so busy trying to keep me from hurting myself like mom ... ... that you won' t give me a chance to just try anything .
well , just because you' ve given up on your dreams doesn' t mean that i have to .
he treats me like i' m still a little girl .
well , i' m not .
i wanna race .
i' m gonna race ... ... and no one can stop me .
doesn' t anybody have a clock ?
easy , girl .
hey !
it' s woodzie .
no !
help me !
i' m drowning !
get out of there , scuzz !
that' s the man' s expresso !
i know .
i' m expressing myself .
you are the reason they invented fly swatters .
there are those that say trenton' s pride is the only real contender this year .
how do you feel about that ?
well , dear , how do you feel about that ?
miss dalrymple , how does trenton' s pride compare with his legendary father ?
well , i like to believe that i can see a good bet , and i ... what ... ?
where' s ... ?
what the ... ?
excuse me .
excuse me !
i can' t believe we' re being upstaged by a zebra .
what is that dreadful child up to now ?
how can they allow this to happen ?
eat my dust , runt !
loser !
i' m gonna run you down !
who do you think you are ?
you don' t belong here !
you don' t know nothing about this !
you' re a joke !
it' s all right , boy .
it' s all right .
let' s go , boy !
whoa , whoa , stripes .
come on , come on , boy !
come on , stripes !
come on !
come on , boy !
come on !
faster !
come on , buddy !
attaboy !
faster , stripes , faster !
come on !
who would have thought a zebra could have such a kick ?
he' s on the rail and moving fast .
chan !
oh , my .
come on , come on , let' s go !
you better make sure you get this , mike .
chan !
chan !
nothing' s broken .
honey , just look in my eyes .
dad , it' s nothing .
listen .
it' s fine .
this is what i told you was gonna happen .
your father' s right .
he just got spooked .
it' s not his fault .
he just needs some more training .
yes , right .
i' m sure that more than half of the blame sits squarely on the shoulders of his rider .
you' re such a ...
chan .
chan , chan !
just go get stripes and meet me in the parking lot .
you so obsessed with winning you' il pick on a girl ?
really , nolan .
you expect me to dignify that ?
i' m just a kentucky gal who loves watching thoroughbreds race at the top of their game .
of course you are .
i' il tell you what .
as chairman of the turfway board ... ... i hereby extend an invitation to mr. walsh ... ... to enter his zebra in the kentucky open .
all it takes is an entrance fee .
how about that , mr. walsh ?
mr. walsh ?
mr. walsh ?
well , there goes the great nolan walsh , everyone .
corn farmer and zebra trainer .
and you can print that .
hey , clara , can they print that you ain' t won the kentucky open ... ... since nolan stopped training your horses for you ?
what do you have to say about that ?
mind your own business .
you there !
see what happens when you forget your place .
a racetrack is no place for a zebra .
what did you just call me ?
a zebra !
which is what you are .
you didn' t really think you were a horse , did you ?
but i am a horse .
a racehorse .
you' re nothing of the kind .
you' re lunch for a lion , and that' s about it .
one thing' s for sure , kid .
you will never be a racehorse .
a zebra ?
i thought i was a racehorse .
why didn' t anyone tell me ?
well , i just can' t believe you deliberately disobeyed me .
i can' t believe you took her side .
i didn' t .
and don' t change the subject .
mom would' ve let me ride .
don' t bring your mother into this !
just don' t .
why not ?
at least she would' ve tried to understand .
it' s more than i can say for you !
don' t get out of the truck !
channing , get back in the truck .
don' t do it .
well , well , well .
look what the cat drug in .
don' t shoot me , don' t shoot me !
jersey flashback .
hey , we made it , man !
nice !
that sure beats flying .
we made it , but ...
well , little skeeter here didn' t .
oh , no .
" look both ways before crossing .
" look both ways before crossing .
afternoon , woodzie .
what brings you out here ?
i got a hunch about your zebra .
look at this .
i left it right where it was this morning .
twenty three seconds a quarter mile ?
he didn' t finish ... ... but i got him between the quarter pole and the half mile pole .
twenty three flat .
your zebra .
look , that zebra really wants to race .
i can see it .
you just need to train him .
where would i do that ?
and even if i could , i mean ... ... you got the $5000 entrance fee ?
i don' t .
i do .
and i won most of it betting on your horses .
i know a good bet when i see it , and i can' t bet him if he' s not in the race .
come on , nolan .
no .
that' s final .
too poor to paint , too proud to whitewash .
he' s not gonna let stripes race .
that' s not cool .
let' s go talk to tucker .
guess who .
hey , buzz and scuzz !
how you been , fellas ?
we miss you down at the track .
those were great years .
yeah , yeah .
listen , listen .
we got some bad news for stripes .
let me guess .
his parole officers caught up with him .
don' t let them take you .
is he always like this ?
worse .
much worse .
anyway , listen , kid .
the chief isn' t gonna let you race .
but don' t worry .
we' il cheer you up .
check this one out .
get off me , you stupid flies !
get off !
man , " ebony and ivory " didn' t work .
that' s a first .
told you we should' ve rapped .
stripes .
walking away isn' t gonna solve anything .
who cares .
leave me alone !
we' ve gotta get this kid into the race .
the chief will never go for it .
of course he will .
just like somebody else i know .
he just needs a little push .
i' m going to bed .
channing ?
yeah ?
why don' t you come on out here .
come on .
this is gonna be a hard one , honey .
probably the only thing to do , really the obvious thing ... ... is to get rid of the problem .
what ?
dad .
no !
it' s not stripes ' fault .
he' s not the problem .
it' s my fault .
dad , you can' t just get rid of him .
i ...
i know him better than anyone ever could .
i love him .
what do you think the alternative is ?
i don' t ride him .
ever , ever again .
that' s right , honey .
franny ?
hey .
hey .
how did you know ?
if you build it , they will come .
well , it' s showtime , kid .
you ready to start training ?
why bother ?
i don' t understand this .
isn' t this what he wanted ?
this is exactly why i never had kids .
reggie ?
yes ?
get off my back .
hey , hotshot .
run into any trees lately ?
oh , great .
more jokes .
i really wanna be alone , sandy .
what' s going on with you ?
that doesn' t sound like the attitude of a racehorse .
because i' m not a racehorse .
i' m not even a regular horse .
i' m a ...
zebra ?
i know .
i' ve traveled around the world , remember ?
why didn' t you say anything ?
because i don' t care that you' re not a racehorse .
you love to run , and that' s all that matters .
maybe to you .
but it' s not your problem , sandy .
you know , if you wanna see the real problem , try looking down .
fine .
after we' re done with the gate ... ... we need to think about how he' s gonna last .
so we gotta work on stamina , more than speed ... ... because zebras burn more adrenaline .
they have a heightened flight reflex ... ... that comes from being hunted on the plains of africa .
you' re not the only one who uses the internet .
impressive , dad .
come on , let' s get back to it .
let' s give him one more shot at it .
all right , bring him in .
that' s it , that' s it .
careful , chan .
careful .
it' s all right .
stop .
walk him away .
now , just walk him away from the gate .
the gate' s always trouble .
they should know .
he needs a break .
he needs a break .
so do i.
i don' t know why he' s acting like this .
it' s gonna take him some time , that' s all .
he' il be all right .
i better go talk to the kid .
take it easy on him .
hey , what' s your problem ?
i' m not a racehorse .
what ?
i don' t belong in the gate !
no , no , you' re wrong .
and i' il tell you why .
racing is for anyone .
anyone with a fire in their heart .
what do you know , you little nobody ?
you never raced .
they' re all the same .
tucker doesn' t understand .
he didn' t even know that i was a zebra .
he doesn' t get it .
what' s he ever done ?
let me tell you something .
i' ve made a few clams on the ponies .
this guy' s all hair and no brains .
that' s just about enough out of you , young colt .
and , goose , bang !
hit the hay !
come here .
people think they know everything .
you tell somebody something , they get an attitude .
hey , i didn' t know the goat was packing .
come up here .
i want you to take a look up there .
you tell me what you see .
i' ve seen them .
the chief , my girl and her mother .
and that' s it ?
no .
look closer .
that' s sir trenton .
and who else ?
tucker .
that' s right , tucker .
he trained sir trenton .
he and the chief trained all the winners .
and not one of them ever , ever thanked him .
how come he never said anything ?
because to him ... ... actions speak louder than words .
he believes in you .
and now you' re gonna have to believe in him too .
i' m sorry for the way i' ve been acting .
i' m the last one who should be name calling .
look at me .
when you got shorter legs than a sheepdog ... ... you get used to being made fun of .
i can relate .
it' s just ...
i' m not really a racehorse .
i' m a ...
i' m a zebra .
so what ?
you' re a horse with stripes who needs an attitude adjustment .
tucker , you don' t really think i have what it takes , do you ?
now listen to me , kid .
you' re right .
you don' t have the strength or ability of a thoroughbred ...
i knew it . ... but you have got more heart ... ... than all of them put together .
but the gate !
i freeze up .
it keeps me from running .
i don' t know what it is .
i can' t do it .
most horses are afraid of the gate at first .
it' s perfectly normal .
but they get over it .
you will too .
you just keep running , okay ?
and let the chief worry about the gate .
he knows what he' s doing .
attaboy !
yeah , boy !
did you see that ?
you see that ?
good job , chan !
there it is !
that' s what i' m talking about !
good job , chan !
walk him out .
we might actually have a chance .
if we' re lucky , maybe at 99 1 .
there' s just one thing left to work on .
and that' s the gate .
no problem .
you' ve worked every kind of horse there is .
yeah , well , the problem is , he' s not a horse .
relax , nolan .
if anyone can do it , you can .
i' m counting on it .
it' s gonna sound like a carnival .
you won' t know which way to look .
look straight ahead .
just ignore all that noise , all that talk , all that yelling , all that jiggling .
come on , now .
you gotta let all this ...
this out of your mind .
all that' s gotta fall away .
that' s right .
that' s right .
because i want your world to be silent .
i want you to hear nothing but your own heartbeat .
that' s it .
easy does it .
come on , buddy .
that' s a good boy .
good boy .
good boy .
that' s it .
you got the idea .
come on , now .
good job , stripes .
good boy .
chan , duck your head .
that' s not so hard .
slow down .
good boy .
easy does it .
good boy .
just like that .
there you go .
good .
that' s right , good boy .
attaboy .
easy does it .
good boy .
you did it .
yeah , i guess i did , huh ?
now what ?
now you give it all you got .
let' s show them what we got !
they cannot be serious .
this will not stand .
i will not allow that beast to run in my competition .
please , father , don' t interfere .
i can win it , fair and square .
that' s not a risk i' m willing to take .
double pride' s workout schedule .
pull !
pull !
come on , pull !
come on , scuzz !
what are you doing here ?
give it to me !
push !
i can' t do no more , take it !
put the marshmallows back on !
you ate the marshmallows !
stretch him out !
lighten up on him !
lighten up on him !
boy , are you in for a surprise .
you' il never beat a trenton .
you weren' t supposed to hear that .
oh , god , what is that ?
i got a million eyes , and you got every one of them burning !
well , tomorrow' s the big day , kid .
do you think i' m ready ?
absolutely .
listen , you can run , there' s no doubt about that .
your legs are gonna be burning when you' re turning for home .
that' s when you find out what you' re made of .
you know what i used to tell my racers ?
don' t look back , leave it all on the track .
what does that mean ?
kid , when the time is right , you' il know .
hello ?
where you think you going ?
you have a big day tomorrow .
you can' t go .
i need to make things right with sandy .
all right .
i understand .
relationships are like racing .
when you do it for love , you' ve already won .
go on , go on .
hey , sandy .
what ?
i was hoping you' d come by .
i' m sorry that i was mean .
i' m sorry that i ...
you go first .
the things i said the other day ?
i just wanna say i was wrong .
well , yeah .
you just ...
you got me so mad because you weren' t seeing it !
seeing what ?
how lucky you are .
me , lucky ?
yes .
the grass is way greener on your side of the fence .
look at the training facilities .
you' ve got everything a horse could dream of .
yeah , everything except real friends .
friends like you have .
and a friend like i bet you are .
listen , sandy , i know i don' t look like a racehorse , but ...
stop !
stop .
you know , i care more about what' s on the inside , and you have more on the inside ... ... than any of the horses over there .
and i also happen to think ... ... that what you have on the outside is the cutest thing on four hooves .
and , just so you know , i' m already on your side .
well , well , well .
what have we here ?
beauty and the beast .
oh , no .
sir trenton .
i' m afraid there' s been a change of plans , zebra .
you' re about to get scratched from tomorrow' s racecard .
oh , no .
there are so many .
it' s okay .
let' s stay calm .
pretty picture , huh , boys ?
don' t do this , sir trenton , please !
take her away .
all right , boss .
let' s go .
sandy !
stripes , i' m not going anywhere without you !
it' s all right , sandy .
just go .
yeah !
better hide your eyes there , honey !
we' re out of here .
trust me , you don' t wanna see this .
you better not hurt her .
oh , don' t fret about her .
as long as you don' t race tomorrow , i wouldn' t dream of harming her .
you , on the other hand , need to be taught a lesson .
show him !
oh , that' s just great !
the race is in four hours .
well , he went out last night , he said he was gonna go find sandy and ...
and you , miss softy , you just let him go , didn' t you ?
goose , time to earn your keep .
i' m on it !
where are you , kid ?
where are you ?
looks like the work of a pro .
hey , kid .
kid , come on , wake up !
how many wings am i holding up ?
is he okay ?
goose , go get him some water .
i knew i should' ve stayed with him last night .
they have sandy .
sir trenton' s gonna hurt her if i race .
those dirty rats .
i say we get busy and show those bums what for !
oh , yeah !
oh , yeah !
no , you right .
you are right .
let us go and kick some horse flank .
come on , y' all !
let' s move in with the swat team !
quiet !
thank you .
now , listen .
to rescue sandy , we all have to work together .
just when i think i' m out , they pull me back in !
here' s the plan .
and i don' t know why i didn' t think of this earlier .
i could build a giant wooden chicken and hide inside .
then , under cover of night , i' il jump out and i' il ...
or i could just stay home .
knock it off , reggie .
now , listen up .
here' s what we' re gonna do .
listen , boy .
i won this race ... ... my daddy won it , his daddy won it , all the way back to general trenton ... ... who won the first kentucky open 100 years ago .
you get my point ?
i' il do my best , dad .
yeah , well , good .
you won' t get away with this .
hush , now , little girl .
you' re interfering with my mozart .
i wonder if he was a thoroughbred .
there' s sandy .
and there' s sir trenton ... ... all 1500 pounds of him .
we' il never get her out .
oh , yes , we will .
we just need a diversion .
i got your diversion right here .
out of my way .
goose !
stick with the plan !
hey , moron !
up here !
never side against the family .
will you remind me again why we brought him ?
hey , who killed the lights ?
how did you get in here ?
say your prayers , pelican .
your lights are about to go out for good .
can i get a little help here ?
oh , great .
there goes plan a.
say hello ...
to plan b !
horse' s booty at 12 o' clock .
follow me , you' re my wingman .
no way !
you follow me !
you are my wingman !
i am not your wingman !
you' re my " pull my wing " man !
whoa , dude .
a little trim wouldn' t kill you !
what is that hideous racket ?
get back here !
come on , i' il fight you with one wing behind my back .
nobody is allowed in my stables !
i' il shut you up for good !
scuzz !
you always get us in trouble .
hey , trenton !
walk this way .
break it down !
what in the ... ?
this just ain' t my speed here .
you can do it .
you' re superfly , son .
all right , step back and watch me work .
turn this up , now !
say it like you mean it !
come on , now !
what is going on here ?
tucker , get sandy .
you' re the boss .
what ?
come on , sandy .
tucker !
you old rail rat !
i might' ve known !
let' s go !
quick !
you and your animal freak show have gotten in my way for the last time !
those legs won' t carry you far , tucker !
hey !
wait for us !
where are they ?
come on .
stripes !
over here !
sandy !
look out , he' s coming !
i' m getting too old for this .
you was born too old for this .
let' s go !
you won' t get away with this !
leave us alone , sir trenton .
you and your foolish friends accomplished nothing .
the affections of a filly do not make you a racehorse !
you know something , sir trenton ?
i don' t want to be a racehorse .
i' m a zebra .
and i' m going to the big race .
you fool .
come on , tucker .
let' s go win ourselves a horserace .
i like your attitude .
you runts don' t know what you' re in for .
well , he' s nowhere south of the barn .
he' s not by the creek either .
what are we gonna do ?
we' re gonna keep looking .
we' il start at the top of the hill .
well , let' s go !
we got a race to run .
stripes is missing .
we don' t know what happened .
what are you talking about ?
he looks okay to me .
chan , get him cleaned up and loaded right now .
you got it , coach .
it' s the filly .
it always is .
hey !
hey , she' s from philly .
i didn' t know she was from philly .
man , i love those philly cheesesteaks .
or any kind of cheese , really .
or any food from anywhere .
especially candy and poop .
what were we talking about ?
i hate my life .
guys , i' m not gonna let tucker have all the fun .
there' s no way i' m missing this .
hey , hold on !
wait for me !
this chicken is flying the coop !
finally , some peace and quiet .
y' all go ahead .
bye bye , now .
i' il just stay here and watch the palace .
for shizzle .
hang on a second .
i just ...
i think your mom would' ve wanted you to have that .
dad ... ... i don' t know what to say .
well , you were right .
you know , i' ve been ... ... scared since mom died .
you know , too scared to train horses ... ... too scared to let you grow up .
you forgive your old man ?
daddy , you' re not old .
maybe a little gray .
all right , well , let' s get a move on .
riders , up !
there you go .
okay , come on .
stay away from the rail , now .
don' t get boxed in .
ladies and gentlemen , would you all please stand ... ... and join in singing the national anthem .
when you' re in the gate , don' t listen to the other racers .
let them do all the horsing around .
save your energy for when it counts .
right .
but , tucker , i do kind of feel sick to my stomach .
good .
that means you' re ready .
this is courtney jones , knn , coming to you live ... ... from turfway park , where horseracing history is about to be made .
can a zebra ... ?
sentimental favorite , stripes ... ... can beat trenton' s pride .
he is trained by the legendary nolan walsh ... ... who came out of retirement specifically for this race .
stripes is ridden by the remarkable 16 year old jockey , channing walsh .
what could go down as extraordinary in the history of horseracing ... ... is taking place at turfway park .
only a few short weeks ago , no one had ever heard of stripes , the racing zebra .
nolan .
clara .
beautiful day , huh ?
it would be if you weren' t working so hard to ruin my race day ... ... with that glorified donkey of yours .
you' re chipper for someone who' s about to lose .
you wanna make this more interesting ?
i mean ...
i' m listening .
all right .
i' il make you a deal .
my zebra wins , i get your filly , the white jumper .
and your horse wins , i' il ...
i' il give you the walsh farm .
nolan .
my filly is worth twice as much as your piece of land .
i tell you what .
you lose , and you come back to work for me .
lifetime contract , in writing .
deal .
it' il be real nice to have you back , nolan .
all right , no speeches .
you all know what to do .
go get them .
there he is !
come on , franny !
you didn' t think we' d let you have all the glory to yourself .
just like old times , franny .
ladies and gentlemen , the starter has now called the roll .
the horses are approaching the starting gate .
i' m gonna grind you into the track , pony boy !
you' re pathetic !
you' re going down !
knock you out of the park !
gonna get trampled !
you' re a joke !
they' re all in .
and away they go .
marietta' s rock , pirate' s cove and trenton' s pride ... ... came away smartly , with jordan' s revenge ...
ride , stripes !
go !
come on , stripes !
ruffshodd keeping stripes tight on the rail ... ... with marc' s a mystery , flemish fury and brown nose biren .
as they head into the first corner , marietta' s rock' s gone ahead to lead ...
you' re out of your league , freak !
you should' ve stuck to racing the mailman .
tell tucker ruffshodd' s got him boxed in !
copy that , goose !
ten four !
roger wilco !
trenton' s pride is back in third .
stripes is along the inside ...
ruffshodd' s boxed him in .
tell stripes hug the rail ... ... and make his move at the turn .
got it !
let' s fly !
hey , buzz ?
what ?
did you notice the irony when you said , " let' s fly " ?
what are you talking about ?
i' m just asking .
because we are flies and all .
do you ever think about that stuff ?
would you shut up ?
tucker says to hug the rail and make your move at the turn .
you' re doing great !
you' re doing great !
mistake .
miyuki' s magic is a long leader outside , then comes marc' s a mystery ...
how does the rail taste ?
you' il never see the finish line !
ruffshodd' s putting the jersey squeeze on him .
that' s a dirty trick !
oh , not for long .
time to take a bite out of crime .
oh , i hate horse meat .
here goes .
coming out of the turn .
and ruffshodd has inexplicably tossed his rider !
and ruffshodd is out of the race !
marietta' s rock ...
that' s my boy .
you' ve always been a pain in the butt .
they' re down the back stretch .
trenton' s pride is running the perfect race .
he' s moving like an absolute winner .
trenton' s pride , right up there in third spot .
the sentimental choice , stripes , is coming under pressure and starting to drop back .
stripes seems to be running out of steam .
had enough , boy ?
trenton' s pride is going strongly up there amongst the leading line .
three parts of the way through the race , marietta' s rock still in front ... ... from pirate' s cove , then trenton' s pride moving like a winner in third .
it was just too much to ask of him .
in comes miyuki' s magic .
by a league is pirate' s cove ...
i can' t do it .
i can' t do it !
stripes is in the rear .
the kid ...
the kid is wiped out .
yeah , he' s falling back fast .
all right .
okay .
one last shot .
you tell him if he believes he' s not good enough , he should stop trying .
it' s okay .
this is superfly .
we' re proceeding to the target .
do you copy , scuzz ?
hey , i told you to use my code name , luke scuzzwalker !
kid , listen .
coach says that if you' re not good enough , you should stop trying .
it' s okay .
you tell tucker i' ve got a message for him !
hey !
stripes said to tell you , " don' t look back , leave it all on the track !
yes !
that trick works every time !
good boy !
go , stripes !
let' s go !
stripes is starting to get in on the inside .
stripes is surging back into contention .
trenton' s pride in front , but here comes stripes charging along the inside .
and stripes is picking them off one by one , he' s coming at trenton' s pride !
come on , stripes !
stripes !
come on , stripes !
stripes is coming in around the inside .
come on , channing !
come on , channing !
these two are now locked together !
stripes inside , finding trouble on the rail .
behind him , trenton' s pride .
these two are head to head !
come on !
let him run !
they' re head to head .
they' re inside the final stages !
stripes and trenton' s pride ...
come on !
yes , yes !
come on !
they' re racing up towards the line .
stripes along the inside .
let him run !
come on , channing !
come on !
come on !
run !
move your butt !
come on !
way to go !
yeah !
yeah !
that' s my boy right there !
kentucky open , he' s edged out trenton' s pride ... ... and stripes is the winner of the kentucky open ... ... narrowly beating trenton' s pride in a driving finish .
i won .
i can' t believe i won !
that' s my best boy .
come on , hurry up !
we' re going to the winner' s circle !
this is his moment , guys .
come on .
he did it !
did you see him , dad ?
did you see him ?
he almost shot out from underneath me !
your mom would be so proud .
and so am i.
hey , stripey .
yeah ?
my father was wrong about you .
you' re a great racer .
thanks !
so are you .
we left it all on the track , didn' t we ?
yeah .
yeah , i guess we did .
i' il see you at the fence ?
yeah .
see you .
great job .
you make a lousy gangster , but you' re a stand up pelican .
listen , you mug , i ...
hey , that' s the nicest thing a very short horse ever said to me .
