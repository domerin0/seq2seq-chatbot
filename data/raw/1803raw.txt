a military dictatorship was in power .
all the military could think about was power .
poweroverthe students , poweroverthe workers ... poweroverthe press .
those were tough days .
it was the year brazil became third time soccerchampion ... in mexico world cup .
third time champion is a sort of fifth time champion of those days .
this film is about all that stuff .

hey , dolores , what' s the rush ?
i don' t know what you see in these high command meetings .

one moment , one moment !
excuse me , but apart from the half naked women ... females of the feminine sex are not allowed .
what ? !

get out of the way !

general manso , the phone' s ringing .
the red phone ?
my direct line to the president !
but , general , the phone' s blue .
idiot !
red is a commie color !

hello , mr. president .
certainly , mr. president .
don' t worry .
as soon as the parade finishes , the players will bring me the cup .
tomorrow morning , the cup will be at the palace , mr. president .
would you like a drink ?
cuba libre ?
cuba libre ?
no , i wouldn' t , it' s out of the question , i won' t have it .
the presence of a communist drink in this place ... is a provocation to the brazilian armed forces !
i' il have you put on the stick !
no , no !
private stick !
not again !
he' s all yours !
yes , sir !
s ... tick !
gal . " costa tonlght hey , dolores ... there' s a gal costa concert on tonight ?
but isn' t she that hairy hippie friend of those commie musicians ?
no , you idiot , it' s a concert by general costa ... the biggest name in brazilian military music .
hello , all you guys in the barracks !
hello , crazy people in high command !
i want everyone shaking their bones .
uh , uh , uh so tough
uh , uh , uh so tough
so tough being a hard line soldier
spending your life arresting commies
to beat and punch without censor
and then make them disappear without a trace
uh , uh , uh so tough
uh , uh , uh so tough
so tough the dictatorship' s long night
paint trees and torture wash toilets
shine boots with courage
in defense of brazilian territory
your attention !
i bring an ultra secret and confidential message ... authorized only for 5 star generals or higher .
all others must immediately begin ... the security procedure for secret messages .
standard procedure begun .
this message will self destruct in 15 seconds .
the jules rimet cup has been stolen ... by a group of dangerous terrorist subversives .
how long' s it been ?
thirteen , fourteen ...
as the commander of the important mission ... to recover the jules rimet cup , i' d like to say ...
you' il say nothing , manso !
the only ones scared of you are your little generals here !
you' re not taking charge of this operation .
my husband will command this operation , general miranda imbiruu ... ... of the brazilian army !
me ? !
are you crazy , dolores ?
chasing commies is very stressful .
don' t be dumb , mirandinha .
this is our chance .
you find the cup , get famous ... become the next president , and i' il be first lady .
but , mrs. dolores ...
there' il be no discussion !
absolutely not !
i' ve made my decision and decided .
enough beating around the bush .
let' s go , mirandinha !
what a fantastic woman .
what a female !
the world cup is ours , comrades !
it' s our first victory against the dictatorship .
long live the vrm !
vrm ?
what the hell' s vrm ?
vladimir' s revolutionary movement .
why vladimir ?
because the movement' s mine !
that' s not fair .
as a member of the artistic class , i should have been consulted .
that name , vrm , it' s no good , man .
and anyway , why " v " ?
i thought wladimir was with " w " .
you don' t understand anything about dictatorship , comrade .
do you really think i' d use my real name ?
wladimir with " v " is my code name to fool the repressive forces ... of the repression .
holy cow , what a lot of smoke !
it looks like my bedroom !
the vehicle used in the operation is no longer operational .
we shall have to continue the revolutionary struggle ... on foot !
comrade peixoto carlos , give me the cup we took from the dictatorship .
groovy , man .
now that we have the cup ... the military will have to meet our demands .
sure thing , man !
we must also demand an end to racism ... in brazilian music .
the only reason i never became famous ... was because the movement wouldn' t allow a black singer !
hold on , you' re not black .
yeah , that was another drawback .
hey , you six .
i recognize you .
you' re artists , aren' t you ?
wait a minute .
you' re blind drunk .
you must be mistaking us for someone else .
no , i' m not , it' s you .
there' s a picture of you on that poster .
only artists appear on posters !
look !
want ...
hold on , comrade alcoholic , i' il read that .
wanted dangerous subversive terrorists .
dead or alive .
preferably ... dead .
dead ? !
we' re done for !
they won' t just kill .
they' il arrest , then beat us and torture us ... with red hot iron bars , damn it !
gee , tear down that poster before someone sees it !
you tearing down poster ?
then i hope you' re not in a hurry .
look .
wanted oh , my god !
look !
look !
lh , look !
it' s us , it' s us !
my dear god .
now what ?
what are we to do ?
young man , why don' t you get a ride ... with that lady who' s been following you all this time ?
what a coincidence meeting you here .
oh , you' re that chick with no panties ... from the steak house , waving all that meat about ?
you and your car are hereby " expopriated " ... to be used in the fight against the dictatorship !
from now on , you and your car belong to the vrm ...
vladimir' s revolutionary movement .
gee , there you go again with that awful name , man .
yeah , that name' s terrible .
we should think up a more fashion name .
i know it' s none of my business .
i know it' s your revolutionary group ... but couldn' t you discuss this some other time ... and hurry up and decide where we' re going ?
yeah , where are we going , wladimir ?
i couldn' t care less .
when it comes to naming the movement , my name stinks .
where are we going , wladimir ?
go to hell !
sorry to interrupt again .
i know it' s not my terrorist group ... but i also know a great place for us to hide .
all right , we really do need a nice safe , cozy hiding place ... to rest up till we take up the fight again ... and finally overthrow capitalism !
let' s go !
i must be sitting on something , man .
what a weird bag .
hey , don' t insult my bag .
it' s made of real straw .
it' s from jamaica !
wait .
if it' s from jamaica , it must be good stuff .
guys , this revolutionary life of yours is so exciting .
this fight for freedom , this defiance .
shut up !
you' re nothing but a daughter of the middle class bourgeoisie ... which is handing brazil over to the american yankee imperialism ... ... from abroad !
ah !
oh !
you gave me goosebumps !
wow , baby , you say such beautiful things .
ah , but i bet you say it to all the girls .
withdraw your bourgeois fingers from my revolutionary member !
nothing must distract me from the fight for ultimate victory !
and we die and we die
on highway br 3 on highway br 3
a rocket tears through the sky
crossing space and jesus christ
damn them , they stole my song !
i wrote that , man !
only it was a different highway and the words more instructive .
listen .
we run
we run
on highway br 101
which borders the brazilian coast
crossing the atlantic mountain range
there' s a dream colorful trip
sometimes start
trouble !
the men !
holy cow !
we' ve had it !
i' ve got to get rid of this !
come on , come on !
my god .
or rather , not my god because i' m an atheist .
we' re in the repression clutches !

get out !
easy , baby , leave it to me , i' il sort this out .
hand me my bag .

they must be there back .
your papers were in the bag ?
i' il only be able to give them back tomorrow .
do you have an emergency triangle ?
yes , sir .
then show it to me .
it must be here somewhere .
this car sure has a big trunk .
you can fit quite a lot in it .
all right , girl , that' s fine .
i' ve seen the triangle .
you can go .
thanks !
nice place .
we' il " expopriate " this bourgeois property ... ... for the revolution !
great .
i don' t know ...
i' m not sure my father will like this expropriation .
he loves his roses .
you know how generals are .
they have funny ways .
you' re a general' s daughter ?
yes , she was at the steak house with the general with no panties .
the general had no panties ?
wait .
how come you brought us right into the enemy' s lair ?
easy , baby !
my folks haven' t been here for ages .
there' s no way they' re gonna show up just now .
mirandinha , you' re a moron !
we shouldn' t go to the farm at a time like this !
you should have stayed to investigate the cup' s theft !
dodozinha , but it' s been so long since i saw my rose bushes ... my chickens .
i miss them so .
it wasn' t for watering roses or breeding chickens .
that the revolution occurred .
miranda imbiruu , you' re no general ... you' re the disgrace of the brazilian army !
oh , dolores , i joined the army for a quiet life ... to whitewash trees , for the annual parade .
now they' ve invented this dictatorship thing ... hunting down communists .
communists are too wild , they' re all young kids !
comrades , we' ve no time to lose !
the world cup is ours !
the dictatorship is in our hands !
long live the vrm !
vladimir' s revolutionary movement !
no , cut it out , man .
we already told you a thousand times we don' t like that name .
gee , i don' t know why you keep insisting .
forget it , ok ?
yeah , man !
let' s choose a name for our band , i mean ... terrorist gang here , now and by mutual agreement , all right ?
sure thing .
all right , then .
so let' s have a meeting .
you' re promoted from revolution driver ... to revolution secretary !
go get a pen and paper !
right away , comrade .
right , so since the militants won' t name the organization ... after its great leader , which genius has a better idea ?
i was thinking of something like ...
department of ...
international ...
communist ...
komrades .
groovy !
d. i. c. k. i love this name !

no one will want anything to do with dick !
i wouldn' t mind .

sorry about that .
oh , my god !

let' s go , let' s go !
hurry up with that key , mirandinha !
i must find out what my daughter is up to in there !

wait , honey , i can' t get it in .
look , mirandinha , you' ve always been useless ... but now' s your moment .
come on , you moron !
lucy ellen !
mother !
what a lovely surprise !
i was just talking about you to the holy fathers .
fathers ? !
lucy ellen , you' re with priests ?
you don' t even go to church !
yes , but , mother , it' s never too late to find god' s word .
i came here to meditate .
and these reverends ... were just passing through this region spreading jesus ' message !
what a marvelous coincidence , isn' t it , my daughter ?
an amazing coincidence .
almost a miracle .
so , mother , if it' s a miracle , that' s got to do with religion !
mother , wasn' t it you who always wanted me ... to follow the path of faith ?
sure , dodozinha , stop giving the girl a hard time .
your blessing , father .
god bless you , man .
so you' re priests , are you ?
and if you' re priests ... you can answer one little question !
where was our lord , the savior , born ?
in cuba .
cuba ? !
cuba ? !
i knew something strange was going on in here !
wait , i know .
moscow .
moscow ? !
brothers , let' s go .
we must take god' s word ... to other sheep in our flock , man .
sure thing .
amen , amen !
let' s go !
mirandinha , the cup !
wait , it' s mine !
mirandinha !
you' re surrounded !
there' s no pointing in trying to defend yourselves !
hand over the cup and commit suicide !
not necessarily in that order !
they' ve destroyed my rose bushes ... and killed my hens .
have they no limits ? !
where will this revolution end ?
stop blubbering , mirandinha !
stop being such a wimp .
you know you can' t have a revolution without breaking a few eggs !
it' s no use , general manso , it was my husband who found the cup ...
general miranda imbiruu , of the brazilian army !
mirandinha is a blockhead !
he can' t even find his way home !
but it' s my mirandinha who' s going to get promoted .
he' il be the president !
mirandinha , president ?
only of the impotent pensioners reserve club !
impotent , yes !
but impotent president of brazil !
retreat !
i have to admit ... that dolores is one helluva woman !
welcome .
that' s why i like working with you communists , always punctual .
look , this place is exactly what you asked for .
hidden , total privacy .
it' s been a hideout for several kidnappings .
it' s one of the most sought after hideouts in rio de janeiro .
it' s falling apart .
haven' t you got a better hideout ?
we' ve got places for all types of leftwing movements .
for example , the festive left .
look at that wonderful mansion ... with a pool , a huge ballroom .
if you' re maoist , just look at this wonderful place .
right next to a chinese restaurant .
the thing is , we' re rather short of cash .
commies are always complaining about money !
where' s moscow' s gold ?
rob a bank , shit !
comrade , you don' t understand .
we want something real cheap , almost free .
we haven' t got anything for the poor , it' s a hot market .
hundreds of clandestine organizations are splitting every day .
the demand' s enormous !
this is the cheapest hideout i have !
man , who are those guys ?
easy , that' s the last tenant .
he' s handing the place over today .
so , comrades , i' m returning this american ambassador .
i won' t need the hideout anymore .

subject to storm strikes .
bring us the subject , and we' il strike him .
gentlemen , i have information ... that the terrorists are right here .
our troops will move along this flank ... supported by tanks coming from the rear .
general , it would be better to attack with fighters and parachutes .
sure !
i' il come in next with my phantom f 5' s ... equipped with 50 mm schmautze machine guns .
no , no fighters !
we must use my parachutists !
yes , i like the parachutists which go tcum topof .
we' il attack with the parachutists !

i' m with the communists !
enough of this bourgeois small talk !
we have the jules rimet .
we shall only return this symbol of dictatorship ... if you comply with our demands !
you communists are so stressed out .
first i must be sure ... you really have the trophy .
how can i be sure ... this ear you sent was really from the jules rimet ?
it can be from any trophy .
the guanabara cup ...
here' s the proof .
look here the jules rimet trophy !
attention , communists !
you' re surrounded !
you with the cup ... hand it over and commit suicide !
not necessarily in that order !
platoon , come back immediately !

the terrorists have gone the other way !
mirandinha , you muddler !
don' t just stand there , you fool !

indian jonathan wants no firewater .
indian jonathan wants to be your guide .
no shorts , no photography ... and the bag must stay outside .
no , mr. indian , we haven' t time to visit the museum now .
ouch !
look !
they can' t be far .
i can smell communist .
they went ... that way .
thanks for the information , my good savage .
sergeant , give him some liquor .
when i get my hands on those bastards , i' il destroy them !
general , we' ve searched the whole museum .
we found no one , sir !
the museum is deserted , sir !
it' s a disgrace , but in our country no one visits museums .
no one values our culture .
damn !
they got away again !
platoon , about turn , march !
oh , shit !
folks , let' s get the cup and thank comrade indian savage .
where' s the indian ?
where' s the cup ?
oh , look , the cup !
wow , the indians won the world cup too , man .
what are you talking about , comrade ?
can' t you see ?
the indians worship a god just like the jules rimet trophy .
the indian robbed us .
we' il never see the cup again .
damn .
wait a minute .
papa pussy village .
located on the left bank of the amazon river .
take the second stream after the lights .
comrades , we' il go after this indian .
dry axe !
avold persplring and attract women
destroylng ralnforest ?
use tabajara chalnsaws
don' t move , man !
comrade stewardess ... this plane is being " expopriated " in the name of the revolution !
comrade pilot , we' re the crap revolutionaries .
we demand that this plane fly immediately to the amazon !
but this plane is already going to the amazon .
really ?
yes .
fine then .
that' s great .
then we demand two sodas for each crap member ... or we' il blow up the plane .
a very strange thing has just happened ... here near maracan stadium in rio de janeiro .
a statue was found dead ... with over 40 machine gun shots .
we' re going to try to speak to general manso ... in charge of the operation , to find out what happened .
unfortunately , the statue committed suicide ... after a profound nervous crisis .
but , general , suicide with a machine gun ?
what' s the problem ?
people can kill themselves as they wish !
this is a democracy !
sure , only i' ve never seen a suicide with 40 shots .
no ?
that' s the trouble with the press , so badly informed .
soldier , show this reporter how to commit suicide ... ... with 40 machine gun shots .
go !
stop !
wait !
attention !
in a daring operation , a dangerous subversive group ... has just abducted a plane bound forthe amazon .
the plane' s route was diverted to the ...
amazon .
the terrorists have been identified as crapmembers ...
carlos revolutionary anti carnivorous party .
carlos ?
why carlos ?
oh , my st. salustiano !
it' s my frederico eugnio !
he went to the amazon , with all that jungle and humidity !
and forgot his cardigan !
mirandinha , jump down , arrest those subversives ... get the cup , so that you' il be president ... ... and i' il be first lady .
but , dolores , are you sure ?
me , alone in the middle of the amazon , it' s very dangerous .
the forest is full of ferocious animals .
lions , tigers , rhinoceros .
those are not nationalist animals !
there are just piranhas , alligators and poisonous snakes !
green light !
jump !
go , stop balking !
so ?
did you get rid of the cuckold ?
sure , my hot general .
now we have all the time in the world just to make love .
make love ? !
i' m bad , i' m real bad .
i' m as bad as they come .
a guy like me doesn' t make love !
i do just dirty stuff !
manso , i bet you say that to all the girls .
we' il never find the indians in all this jungle !
gee , we should get rid of all this jungle .
what if we smoked the forest ?
denlson , i' ve gotta tell you something , man .
you' ve gotta kick this addiction .
what addiction , smoking ?
no , taking it in the ass .
gotcha !
my god !
i' m sorry !
did i hurt you ?
no problem .
i probably only broke a couple of ribs or my collar bone .
but it' s good .
at least it makes a change from the usual routine .
what a pretty cardigan .
can you teach me that stitch ?
sure .
it' s like this .
that' s great .
where did you learn how to knit ?
in the army .
they teach you loads of things , you know .
miranda imbiruu , at your service .
julieta , pleasure .
i' m knitting this cardigan for my son .
look at him .
isn' t he cute ?
but imagine , he' s in the middle of this jungle , this forest ... this humidity , and he' s always going out without his cardigan .
just like my daughter .
lucy ellen is always going out without her panties .
kids are all the same , so much trouble .
but listen to me , mr.
miranda , in the army ... apart from knitting , what else do you do ?
i' m a general .
i' m in the field ... of repression and combat of subversive terrorists .
but i' m dying to retire .
gardening' s more my thing ... ... planting my rose bushes .
oh , roses !
i love roses !
mr. miranda .
you can call me mirandinha .
oh , i think we' ve already been here before .
easy , comrade .
let' s check the map .
here !
when i find those communists , i' il tear out every hair ... then pull their balls and twist them until they bleed !
manso , you' re so romantic !
welcome to papa pussy vlllage
welcome to papa pussy village .
no photography , no shorts ... and you' il have to leave that outside .
name ?
wladimir .
lucy ellen imbiruu .
peixoto carlos , ok ?
listen here , mr. indian , why all this bureaucracy ?
you' re not a cop , what do you need records for ?
indian jonathan isn' t filling in records .
indian jonathan is writing menu .
you needn' t grill me !
nothing will make me name my comrades !
are you crazy , peixoto ?
we' re your comrades ... everyone' s here , man !
hands up .
hands up .
raise your hands ... put down your weapons and let the cute one go .
wow , what a beard .
what a hat .
hey , man , don' t i know you from someplace ?
cat stevens !
man , i' ve been wanting to meet you for ages !
hey , didn' t you steal a song of mine , huh ?
wait , comrade .
this isn' t cat stevens .
this is the great commander che guevara !
but , commander , i thought you had died .
it was in all the papers .
no , i didn' t die .
that was all planned .
a great marketing ploy to increase sales ... of my t shirts and posters with my face .
but , commander , what about the guerilla war ?
that today is just a hobby ... something for the weekends .
the t shirt market is much more lucrative .
but one day we' il take up the guerrilla war again , ok ?
commander , i' m your greatest fan .
i have a tattoo of you .
look !
yes , the beard' s the same ... but fidel is the one who smokes cigars .
wait , commander , you' re looking at the wrong place .
the tattoo is on the thigh .
oh , i see .
mirandinha , do you know where we' re going ?
listen , in the army , did you ever take ... a jungle survival course ?
julieta , i' ve done 62 trainings for jungle survival .
wow , i had no idea you guys trained so much .
no , only i failed 62 times .
are we in vietnam ?
well , honey .
i think i' il have to recalculate .
we went a little bit further .
we' il have to go back .
without me , the revolution would be nothing .
we were in sierra maestra ...
fidel , camilo cienfuegos " y yo " .
joe ? !
what the hell was joe cocker doing in cuba , man ?
don' t be stupid , comrade .
yo " means " me " in spanish !
you were in sierra maestra too , man ?
wow , commander , you say such amazing things .
but tell me something , baby ... are all guerrilla fighters as charming as you ?
lucy , guerrilla fighters aren' t charming .
they' re ugly , dirty , bearded , stinking , sweaty .
stop , wladimir !
you' re only saying that to make me horny , right ?
i think we' d better go to sleep and leave the commander to rest .
good idea , good idea .
let' s all get some sleep .
men on one side , women ... in different tents , ok ?
to avoid any trouble which might damage the revolution , ok ?
let' s get some sleep .
didn' t i tell you , lucy ?
sex between fighting comrades ... only wastes the energy which should be used ... in the fight against the oppressive forces of the oppression .
holy cow !
this rifle' s excellent .
must be from jamaica .
it' s now that the cock will crow .
chick , chick .
see how fine .
wow !
oh , che !
how big !
you ain' t seen nothing yet , we must grow hard !
but ... without ever losing one' s tenderness , right ?
chick , now i' il show you ... how we do it down in cuba .
oh , che !
not down there !
it hurts too much !
oh , che !
delicious .
i forbid this sexual copulation !
you are violating commander che guevara' s ... ... revolutionary rules !
calm down !
calm down , comrade cuckold , you don' t understand !
che !
it' s you ?
what' s this , comrade ?
you fooled me !
you betrayed the revolutionary ideals !
you communists are really boring , so stressed out !
you can' t even have a quick screw in peace !
look , if it weren' t for the t shirt business ...
i' d have got out of this a long time ago !
bastard !
easy , comrade cuckold !
easy , comrade cuckold !
easy , comrade cuckold !
bastard .
calm down !
oh , my god !
a shot !
do you think something' s happened to my frederico eugnio ?
if it' s lucy , dolores will kill me !
frederico eugnio , what' s happened ?
are you all right , son ?
don' t worry , i brought your cardigan , look !
damn , i' ve killed che guevara !
what' s going on ?
this member of the dictatorship ... allied to the american yankee imperialism ... has just assassinated the great leader che guevara !
me ?
julieta , your son' s crazy !
i only just got here !
che is dead .
and now , what shall we do ?
i don' t know about you .
i' m going to the beach .
i' m going to bzios to grab a few hot bitches .
you' ve no revolutionary conscience !
i shall fight on !
now , with the commander' s second death ... the t shirt business will expand wildly !
true .
i' m off to the beach .
money comes first .
everyone !
everyone , the cup' s here !
lucy ellen , my dear , you' re up there ... with no panties !
i think our movement has started to crack up .
and what a crack !
attention , subversive terrorists and primitive savages !
hand over the jules rimet trophy and commit suicide !
not necessarily in that order !
holy cow , man !
we' re gonna die !
we' ve had it !
and not necessarily in that order .
it' s no use , the troops will never lay their hands on this cup !
are you sure , man ?
sure , look .
they' re sinking in quicksand generated by computer graphics !
but that' s terrible !
you' re telling me !
it could be so much more realistic !
if it was an american movie , it would be far better !
manso , we' re going to die !
i know how to survive in desperate situations .
i' il grab that creeper .
jump on my back and hold tight !
that' s no creeper !
yuck !
we' re dying just because you weren' t man enough ... to hold the indian' s creeper !
i' m a general of the brazilian armed forces !
i' d never hold the member of a primitive being and inferior race !
inferior ?
that big ?
manso , you' ve gotta be kidding !
the end
what , that' s it ?
that' s the ending ?
i thought this film was a comedy .
sure is .
give me a break !
folks , the film needn' t end like that .
make up a new ending !
champagne .
champagne .
wow , what a great happy ending !
we' re in first class !
would you like a shrimp ?
wow , look at the size of that shrimp .
is it from jamaica ?
lucy ellen , my dear , now that it' s all over ... promise me one thing .
you' il never go out without your panties again !
don' t worry , general , i' il take care of her .
lucy , do as your father says .
go in there and put these on .
wow , wladimir , you' re so romantic .
you know , that was the first time ... a man ever asked me to put my panties on .
wait , we can' t marry now .
you' re only 13 .
i' m woody allen .
we' il have to wait a bit .
your attention , please .
we' ve just lost all our engines .
we' il try to make an emergency landing .
our chances of survival are minimal .
please , place your id in your pocket ... to help with the identification of the bodies .
oh , my oscar !
where' s my oscar ?
thank you for flying with this airline .
if you have any question , our ground staff ... will be happy to direct you to the nearest cemetery .
just kidding !
where' s my oscar ?
gee .
that shrimp from jamaica really made me high .
i' m hallucinating that the plane crashed in the jungle !
yeah !
far out , man !
oh !
wladimir , thank god you' re alive .
oh , darling , are you all right ?
no way , all his clothes are torn !
wladimir , you' il catch your death of cold .
put on your cardigan , son .
and the cup ?
where' s the cup ?
we' ve lost the cup !
easy , general .
everything' s groovy .
amid all the confusion ...
i managed to grab the cup and put it in this bag .
wow , great .
the film hasn' t even finished , and we' ve already won an oscar !
people , don' t go , it' s time for the debate .
the film is about the 70' s .
back then ... films were always followed by debates .
so , has anyone a question ?
you can ask anything you like .
a person there has a question .
i have a question .
where are the toilets ?
serious .
does anyone have a question about the film ?
about the film ?
i have one .
if i wanna watch the next session , is it free ?
folks , this is serious .
we took ages making this film .
a question anyone ?
i have one .
there' s a mistake in this film .
you know when the terrorists are escaping ... and meet that drunk guy ?
a very modern car passes ... a car that wasn' t around at that time .
you' re right .
in those days they didn' t have ... such modern and sophisticated cars as the polo sedan .
but volkswagen merchandising did exist .
buddy , i' m a film critic ... and , like ...
i thought the explosions in this film were really phony .
how about that one , better ?
great .
another question .
i haven' t a question , but i' m a fan of yours .
could i take a picture with you ?
sure , come on up .
for real ?
hey , what' s up ?
hi .
ouch !
hey , someone pinched my ass !
what' s the problem ?
you' re a fan .
sure , but that doesn' t mean you can pinch my ass .
pretty lousy fan if you won' t even let us pinch your ass .
really !
