i waited by the plaza but he never came .
how long did you wait ?
don' t laugh .
i' m not laughing .

i didn' t really like him anyway .
ln any case ... check out that guy over there .
he looks at me and smiles like that all the time .

like a ball of dough .
come here , pachito .
you' re scaring him , maria .
diana , pass him to me .
come , sit down .
mom , will you fix a tea for him ?
you know those teas don' t do anything .
take him to the doctor .
no , grandma , i don' t trust that doctor .
you don' t have to take him anywhere .
he' s fine .
what are you looking for ?
i' m not sure , grandma .
i don' t feel like bread .
i said the white ones at 40 .
what happened ?
sir .
what' s wrong ?
can i go to the bathroom ?
again ?
i don' t feel well .
you' re four bins under this hour , and three last hour .
how will you catch up if you' re in the bathroom all the time ?
please , i' il be quick .
i have 84 workers in this section ... and everyone else puts their head down and does their job .
but with you , it' s like a constant tug of war .
at this point i don' t know what to
what the hell ?
what' s wrong with you ?
look at this mess .
this is disgusting .
what are you going to do with these now ?
tell me .
what are you going to do ?
pick them up .
take them over there .
hurry up .
clean them .
be careful of the buds .
but if they' re already ruined .
i don' t care .
clean them off .
i want all those roses clean .
and when you' re done with that you can go back ... and make up what you owe me .
ls that clear ?
yes , sir .

it' s 9, 600 .
maria , give me the money .
and why should i pay ?
it' s for pacho .
he started vomiting .
where' s your money ?
maria .
i give up all i make and diana doesn' t put in anything .
and i have to pay for the kid' s medicine ?
don' t start with me , maria .
just give me the money .
you can keep the money from your next check .
i don' t know why everything is so difficult with you .
well , there won' t be a next check .
because i quit my job .
what ?
when ?
today .
but why ?
they wouldn' t let me go to the bathroom .
not once ?
it' s not just that .
i don' t like how they treat me .
so what are you going to do now ?
you are so stupid , maria .
why don' t you shut up ?
don' t tell me to shut up .
they treated me like shit .
why can' t you just deal ?
why should i put up with it ?
why don' t you think of the family ?
quiet !
that' s enough .
you have to go and apologize to your boss .
i' m not going back .
what are you going to do ?
i' il find another job .
another job ?
there' s nothing but flowers here .
at least it' s a decent job .
please , what' s decent about it ?
maria , go back and apologize .
aren' t you listening ?
i am not going back .
i' m not going back , and that' s it .

why don' t you want to get married ?
i' m stepping up to this .
juan , do you love me ?
oh , not that again .
look me in the eye and tell me you really love me .
what kind of person are you ?
you' re gonna marry someone you don' t even love ?
someone who doesn' t love you ?
how many months or days before you' re sleeping with another woman ?
that' s not gonna happen .
i don' t want to end up like my sister .
sorry , but your sister was an idiot who screwed the first guy that walked by .
shut up .
it' s true .
and now she' s stuck with a kid .
don' t talk about my sister like that .
maria , i am not going anywhere and you know it .
that doesn' t matter .
i am not marrying you .
sorry to break it to you , but you' il have to .
no , juan .
i don' t have to do anything .
that' s the way you are , maria .
you are so stubborn .
you' re an idiot , and a loser .
most guys would' ve left by now .
i don' t know why i stand you .

she works for a wealthy family , in their house .
she' s going to help me out .
don' t laugh .
i' m sorry .
it' s just that ... you' re way too pretty to be working as a maid .
too cute to get dressed up in that hat and apron .
anyway , i was just going to check it out .
nothing was certain .
listen .
lf you' re looking for work i might be able to hook you up .
hook me up ?
it involves traveling .
traveling ?
tell me .
working as a mule .
it' s a cool job .
you go , hand off the stuff , get your cash and that' s it .
everything' s cool .
what about the people on the news ?
the ones in prisons far away .
what about them ?
they' re the ones who want to be famous .
they get caught , get on tv , everyone sees them , and they become famous .
i don' t want to be famous .
i know a guy who can set it all up .
takes care of the papers , makes the arrangements .
know what ?
forget it .
let' s go .
no , hold on .
how much would i get ?
you want something to drink ?

do you have problems with diarrhea ?
constipation ?
digestive problems ?
none .
no , sir .
big eater ?
normal .
okay , then ... we are going to give you several rolls of film .
we' il send you to new york .
actually , to new jersey , a small town next to new york .
once you go though customs ... you' il be met by our people .
they will take you to a safe place .
we' il develop the rolls .
and in five or ten days you' il be back here ... with all your money taking care of your problems .
how much do i get ?
we' il give you $100 per roll .
keep in mind ... we have to take care of your documents .
meaning that after we deduct the expenses for the passport and visa ... and for your papers ... you' il have seven or eight million pesos .
what if i get caught ?
and why would that happen ?
unless you step off the plane shaking like a leaf .
then they' il catch you .
obviously .
but no worries .
those gringos don' t know a thing .
don' t worry .
now ... once your decision is made ... there is no turning back .
you can' t tell anyone .
understand ?
yes , sir .
now , i know you have a lot of problems weighing on you ... and you' re in a difficult situation ... and i don' t want you making this decision ... under that kind of pressure .
so i' m going to give you this ... so you can take care of some things .
actually , it' s really not necessary .
thank you .
no , no , no .
take it .
no obligations .
don' t worry about it .
you were in the bar , right ?

it' s not easy , but it' s not too difficult either .
how old are you ?
seventeen .
but i said i was eighteen .
you just have to be prepared and know how to do it right .
where have you been ?
i went to the city ... to ask jessica for help finding a job .
what did she say ?
it' s none of your business .
don' t tell me it' s not my business .
it' s not .
you didn' t find anything .
or you would' ve said so .
you have to go back to the plantation and get your job back .
no .
it' s not fair to mom .
you know how hard it is for her .
now you' re making things harder ?
get off my back .
don' t even ....
pacho had a 108 fever this morning .
he' s your son .
i know he' s my son .

he' s your responsibility .
who do you think you are ?
you have to find a job .
well , i got one .

at least i put in my share .
take this .
hold it in your mouth .
let it slide to the back .
all the way .
open your throat .
now swallow .
practice with these .
can you swallow these ?
you can' t eat anything for 24 hours before the flight .
your stomach has to be totally empty .
they may lie about how many you have to swallow .
how many will it be ?
for your size , maybe 60 or 70 pellets .
really ?
be glad you' re small .
big guys have to swallow ...
like a hundred .
make sure they' re well wrapped .
lf just one opens up you' il die .
wear nice clothes .
nothing flashy .
you don' t want to look like a peasant showing off .
how many times have you done this ?
two .
how' d it go ?
still here .
the first time i did it i was gonna go see my older sister .
she lives in new york and i haven' t seen her in four years .
but when i got there i realized ...
i didn' t know what to tell her .
how was i going to explain why i was there ?
and how ?
i love her .
but we' re really different .
she' d kill me if she found out i was mixed up in this .
the second time around ...
i made it to her house .
but i couldn' t knock on her door .
what is america like ?
over there ... it' s , like , too perfect .
everything' s straight .
so ... how' s that thing going ?
what thing ?

tell me what you have to do .
i told you not to talk about it .
i talked to franklin .
i' m going to be a mule , too .
you did what ?
you heard me .
why not ?
because you can' t .
yes , i can .
what are you thinking ?
it' s $5, 000 .
you know how much that is in pesos ?
i figured it out .
it' s like 10 million pesos .
i can buy my family a house with that .
no , blanca , you' re not going .
you know what ?
i can do what i want .
i don' t need your permission .
do you know what you' re saying ?
you have to tell them you' re not doing it .
no .
anyway , i can' t now .
i already said yes .
all the way to chiquinquira ?
but you don' t know anything about working in an office .
you don' t think i' m smart enough ?
that' s not what i said .
i don' t understand why you have to go so far away .
what' s up ?
what' s up ?
how are you ?
all good .
and blanca ?
she' s in another place .
don' t worry , baby .

i didn' t know you were coming again .

and you' re always talking bad about her .
she' s always talking about the two of you .
she wants to come and visit .

and she didn' t send anything with you ?
a letter , a photo or something ?
actually ... the truth is ...
lucy gave me your name and address ... and she said that you' re really nice , and that ... if i had any trouble i could come ... and talk to you .
i don' t have a place to stay .
how long have you been here ?
two days .
where were you staying these two days ?
well ....
i was staying with a friend ... but we got into a fight and ... she kicked me out .
and you don' t have anyone else here ?
family , friends ?
nobody ?
no , ma' am .
do you have a job yet ?
no , not yet .
and how did you say you knew lucy ?
carla .
it' s not like i' m gonna throw her out on the street .
it' s just that this apartment is very small .
we sleep in the bedroom , and pablo' s cousin here in the living room .
honestly ...
i don' t need a lot of space .
yes , but for how long ?
only for a few days .
and then what ?
i' il find something .
don' t worry .
my cousin works in a bakery .
he gets home in the middle of the night , so don' t get scared .

i promised mom i would call .

i' m a driver for a car service .

what happened ?
where did you go ?
i met a woman who gave me a place ....
you know each other ?
ls that lucy' s sister ?
you know lucy ?
yes .
what do you mean ?
you said you didn' t know anyone else here .
the thing is ....
i told her about lucy on the way here .
so ... you' re not really a friend of hers .
it' s just that maria said that she was going to stay with you and ...
i don' t have a place to stay .
you , too ?
i don' t understand .
everyone knows someone here .
yes , yes .
i' il get the receipt .
i' il come up with something .
don' t worry .
tell them to fix this , and not to charge you ... since they did it wrong the first time .
how are you ?
fine .
how' s the little one ?
fine , thank you , don fernando .
it seems my sister in colombia sent me a little surprise .
maria and blanca .
hi .
when did they arrive ?
they just got here , but they don' t know anyone .
maybe you know of an apartment ... a job or something .
don' t you worry .
i' il make a couple calls and we' il
yes , sure ...
he' il help you .
i' ve got to go to work .
you know how to get back .
three blocks down and around the corner .
i' il be back tonight to let you in .
thanks .
i' m leaving them here .
bye .
there' s a place that usually needs women to sew .
they don' t check papers ... and they pay minimum wage .
thanks for your help , but we don' t need work .
what are you doing ?
we can' t go back there .
i don' t care what you do .
i' m sick of following you around .
like i asked you to ?
i told you not to come .
you' re the one that wanted to take off before we got paid .
those guys are dangerous .
quiet .
what' s that you' ve got there ?
nothing .
i recognize what those are .
i' ve seen that before .
tell me .
does carla know about this ?
are you all right , physically ?
our friend who was with us got sick .
i think one of the pellets broke inside her .
i don' t know if they killed her or if she died .
i don' t know what to do .
where was this ?
don fernando , please help us find our friend .
i' il make some calls to the police in new jersey .
they might know something .
you can' t call the police .
don' t worry .
i know what i' m doing .
you have to return those drugs .
before they hurt your families in colombia .
do you understand ?
blanca .
i lost the emergency number .
do you have it ?
i can' t believe what you told him about lucy .
he' s calling the cops now .
don' t fucking start with me .
you were the one pulling out the pellets and running your mouth .
you want to sew shirts ?
i' m handling this .
stupidly .
then why are you following me around ?
every time i turn around , there you are .
i thought you knew what you were doing , but obviously not .
i' m not responsible for you .
i' m not your fucking mother .
i wouldn' t want you anyway .
i feel sorry for your baby having such a stupid mother .
how fucking stupid ... swallowing drugs when you' re pregnant .
fuck you .
do you have an appointment ?
no .
i can give you one for next week .
no , it has to be today .
lf you don' t mind waiting , i might get you in ... but i can' t promise .
thanks .
fill this out .
you have to be very careful while you' re pregnant .
you can' t smoke .
you can' t drink alcohol .
no beer , no wine .
especially not drugs .
everything you put in your body goes straight to the baby .
lf you smoke , it' s like giving a cigarette to your baby .
okay ?
let' s see .
at this stage of the pregnancy we can see the entire fetus .

friday , the eleventh of next month .
that' s fine .
they found the body of a woman yesterday .
the stomach had been cut open ... and they think it was a mule .
they sent this information ... with a picture of her face .
i' m sorry .
please ...
i need to know your friend' s name .
and an address in colombia .
what' s her name ?
lucy diaz .
carla' s sister ?
yes .
but carla doesn' t know .
she was coming to visit .
she has to know .
it' s her sister .
i' m sure the baby will sleep with us in the beginning but ... the crib was on sale .
what did don fernando tell you ?
he told me that ...
carla .
i don' t really need a job .
i' m going back to colombia .
darling , you' re not going back .
i know how you feel .
i felt the same way when i came here .
i remember on my grandma' s birthday , i called home ... and i could hear my whole family ...
laughing and screaming .
my little sister asking , " how is it over there ?
ls it wonderful ?
how' s your job ?
telling me how much she wanted to come and stay with me .
i just wanted to tell them how much i missed them .
but it gets better , trust me .
i remember when i got my first paycheck .
i' il never forget going to that office to send money home for the first time .
you can' t imagine how it feels .
your heart feels so big ...
like it won' t fit in your chest .
the real reason i stay here is for my baby .
he' il have so many more opportunities .
i can' t imagine bringing up my child in colombia .
not with the situation being what it is .
it pains me to say it , but it' s true .
i' il get it .
that must be your friend .
they found lucy' s body .
