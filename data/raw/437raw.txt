first time giving blood ?
yes .
they pay cash here .
and there' s no limit to how many times you give .
they even buy it in the jar .
jared nomak , we' re ready for you .
in the past 12 months , have you gotten a tattoo , or undergone any ear , skin , or body piercings ?
no .
where did you get that scar on your chin ?
childhood accident .
you say you don' t have any immediate next of kin ,
is that right ?
not that i' m in contact with .
nobody to call in case of an emergency ?
no one .
no family ?
i told you , no .
are you telling me i can' t be a donor ?
it depends .
we came up with some unusual results on your blood test .
what ?
how unusual ?
let me explain .
your blood has a very rare phenotype , one we haven' t encountered before .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
who are you ?
no .
sit down , please .
what is this ?
this is a good news bad news scenario , jared .
good news for us ... bad news ... ... for you .
forget what you think you know vampires exist .
my name is blade .
i was born half human , half vampire .
they call me " the daywalker .
i have all their strengths , none of their weaknesses .
except for the thirst .
20 years ago i met a man that changed that .
whistler .
he taught me how to hold the thirst at bay .
taught me the rules .
gave me the weapons to hunt with .
silver , garlic , sunlight .
two years ago he was attacked .
they took him , and turned him into the thing i hate most .
i should have finished him off .
now i' m hunting him .
i will find him .
and nothing will stand in my way .
daywalker' s here !
stop him !
where is he ?
hey !
no , no .
take me to him , and i' il consider you a loose end .
catch you later .
old man ... look at what they' ve done to you .
let' s go home .
lock up your daughters , boys and girls , the dark knight returns .
need a toke of the smokage , b ?
later .
cut the lights .
you found him .
you didn' t kill him .
give me a hand .
i got a bad feeling about this , b.
listen to his breathing .
he' s already dying .
he' s in pain .
why don' t you just put him out of his misery right now ?
they had him on stasis in a halfway house .
i' m giving him an accelerated retro viral detox .
like a heroin addict .
make him go cold turkey in one night .
shit ain' t going to work , man .
i say you kill the motherfucker right now .
get out .
if there' s anything left of you in there , whistler ,
listen up .
in the morning those blinds are going to open whether you' re cured ... or not .
hey , man , i didn' t mean to call him
listen to me , blade .
you' re going to have to finish me off .
no .
give me that damn gun .
now walk away .
stubborn son of a bitch .
how do you feel ?
like hammered shit .
how' d you find me ?
i started out in moscow .
then romania .
they kept moving you around .
how long was i gone ?
months ?
too long .
years .
they tortured me almost to death .
and then let me heal in a vat of blood so they could go at it again .
sorry sons of bitches could have at least fixed my goddamn leg while they were at it .
where' s my arc welder ?
what' s up ?
nice to meet you .
i heard a lot about you .
i' m josh .
you can call me " scud .
everybody does .
tell me something , skid
no , man , it' s " scud , " like " stud .
whatever .
what are you doing here ?
the pimpmobile ?
just a little aftermarket modification .
nitrous oxide and shit like that .
oh , yeah .
you gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping .
the whole package will crank that betty up , maybe 300 horsepower .
you' il burn the thing out before your next oil change .
where did you dig up this shitbird , anyway ?
what the fuck is your problem , poppy ?
my problem is i' ve been sucking blood clots for two years .
i get out to find some jerkoff fucking with my life' s work .
we jeopardized our whole operation to save your ass !
our operation ?
yeah .
our operation ?
i built this operation , you ass wipe !
motion sensors !
it' s on three , gentlemen .
human ?
body temperature , 50 .
i' d guess suckhead .
fried .
they' re using magnesium flares .
they' ve got your security system scoped out .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
i don' t trust you
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
cool outfit .
guard lights !
we represent the ruling body of the vampire nation .
they are offering you a truce .
they want to meet with you .
scud .
take off your mask .
my name is asad .
this is nyssa .
you have been our most feared enemy .
but now there' s something else loose on the streets .
something worse than you .
what' s so funny ?
they tell stories about blade as the bogeyman .
frankly , i' m disappointed .
you hear that , b ?
she' s disappointed .
he agreed to come along so easily .
come on , b , show her .
pretty please ?
semtex .
enough explosives to level a city block .
you still disappointed ?
the guards look human .
they' re probably familiars .
you sure about this ?
well , if i' m not ...
the true power of the vampire nation lies here .
father ?
blade , this is overlord eli damaskinos .
it has been said , " be proud of your enemy and enjoy his success .
in that regard , i should thank you .
for what ?
eliminating deacon frost .
you did us a favor .
karel kounen .
you' re human .
barely .
i' m a lawyer .
european health consortium .
as you may know , vampirism is ... a horrible virus , carried in the saliva of predators .
in 72 hours , it spreads through the human bloodstream , creating new parasitic organs .
like cancer .
cancer with a purpose .
unfortunately , viruses evolve , too .
we' ve encountered a new one .
we dubbed it the reaper strain .
and like any good pathogen , it appears to have found a carrier .
there ...
jared nomak .
born a vampire , but an anomaly like you .
unlike the rest of us , however , he feeds on not just humans , but vampires as well .
looks like he was doing me a favor .
you' re missing the point .
their vampire victims don' t die ... they turn .
they become carriers .
you' ve got to understand .
these things are like crack addicts .
they need to feed daily .
nomak' s been up for 72 hours .
by our estimates , there are already a dozen reapers .
there' il be hundreds before the week is out .
thousands within a matter of months .
do the math .
wait .
let me get this right .
you want me to hunt them ... for you ?
when they are finished with us , who do you think they' il turn on next ?
your precious humans .
not one of them will be left .
we spent two years training a small tactical unit
the bloodpack .
we want you to lead them .
two years ?
we' ve been training to hunt you .
so , b man , what do you think ?
sounds like a plan .
what do you really think ?
they' re going to fuck us the first chance they get .
so , we ain' t gonna do this , right ?
we' il play along for now .
they' il take us in deeper than we' ve ever been .
get a chance to see how their world really ticks .
i had enough of their world .
they' re just shitting bricks because they' re no longer top of the food chain .
damn , man , i' m really worried about him .
i know he' s your friend and all , but i think you should watch him .
nobody goes cold turkey from the thirst in just one night .
looking to get hooked up ?
maybe .
what do you have ?
no problem .
horse , hawaiian ice , whatever you need .
whatever i need .
i like that .
what if i need you ?
so , so sweet .
they are ready whenever you are , daywalker .
blade , meet the bloodpack .
lighthammer , verlaine ,
priest , snowman ,
chupa , and reinhardt .
hey , um ... me and the gang were wondering ...
what was that ?
can you blush ?
here we go .
oh , i get it .
i see now .
you' ve been training for two years to take me out .
and now , here i am .
ooh , so exciting , isn' t it ?
okay , here' s your chance .
come on .
what are you waiting for ?
here i am .
right here in front of you .
adolf here gets the first shot .
come on .
what are you looking at her for ?
you need permission ?
maybe you need a little bit of incentive .
okay , i can help with that .
what' s the matter ?
missed that ?
it' s okay , i can do it again .
come on .
what , do you need a manual ?
do it !
kill the bastard !
now you' ve got an explosive device stuck to the back of your head .
silver nitrate .
rigged to go off if anybody tampers with it .
i' il have the detonator with me .
and you if you so much as look at me wrong
from now on we work as a unit .
you' il be taking orders from me .
any questions ?
good .
you want to catch the hunter ?
you start with the prey .
we' il target all the night places where vampires congregate .
blood banks , safe houses .
the bigger the better .
so ... what' s first ?
the house of pain .
where' s the entrance ?
i don' t see any signs .
no vampire glyphs .
no , because of you , we' ve had to rethink our habits , tighten our security .
have a closer look .
nice . . 38 , . 45 and 9mm caliber .
all with foil capsules at the tip filled with silver nitrate , and garlic extract .
this hyper velocity stake gun spits out a silver stake at 6, 000 feet per second .
since you suckers don' t like sunlight , we' ve modified the gun' s entry light with a uv filter .
pop it open instant uv light .
filter' s on , no problem .
yo , b , check this out .
it' s got an pneumatic syringe delivery system .
the vials are filled with an anti coagulant called edta .
one punch with this , you' il blow your target up like a balloon .
the cartridge ejects .
automatic reload .
nice .
let' s go .
you won' t pass for one of us .
like i give a shit .
no , he' s right .
why don' t you post up on the roof over there ?
cover our backs .
so the bloodpack' s calling the shots now , huh ?
great .
better curb that dog of yours or we' il do it for you .
keep pushing , asshole .
we' re in .
you' re about to enter our world .
you will see things feeding .
just remember why you' re here .
i haven' t forgotten .
what exactly are we looking for in here ?
anything that looks suspicious .
you got to be kidding me .
scud , do you read me ?
scud , you reading me ?
reading you loud and clear .
the whole place is a safe house .
the windows are painted black , one access door .
200 , 300 suckheads in here .
that sounds cool .
hey , w , you got me ?
w ?
tell me something , how' s the weather up there ?
walkin ' on sunshine , toad boy .
look at them .
half of these bastards , they' re not even pure bloods .
i tell you what , why don' t we just fucking kill everyone ?
just to make sure .
god , it would be so easy .
he' s got you .
daywalker .
mother' s milk .
i say we got about half an hour till sunrise , cinderella .
hurry up .
i spotted one , but lost it .
be on the lookout .
fuck .
whistler , they' re on the roof .
i got them on the roof of my bus .
shhh .
nomak .
daywalker .
what am i to you ?
is the enemy of my enemy my friend ... or my enemy ?
we' re under attack !
there' s three of them .
probably more .
daylight .
silver don' t do jack shit .
don' t waste the bullets !
motherfucker .
you hear me , chupa ?
say , " cheese .
come on .
how about some daylight , motherfucker ?
fuck !
listen to me .
if you' re under attack , use your uv lights .
use your uv lights .
they can' t take the light .
priest ?
we' re not dying here .
come on .
priest is down .
daylight' s coming .
you' re on your own , blade .
you want me so bad , blade ?
here i am .
why kill me ?
you and i , we have the same enemy .
we want the same thing .
we need the same thing , blade .
what happened ?
why didn' t you tell me these things
were immune to silver and garlic ?
i didn' t know .
if you did , would you have told me ?
i think you know the truth when you hear it .
mm hmm .
then why didn' t he kill you ?
how long since he' s been bitten ?
about 20 minutes .
his skin is fucking burning .
he' s already starting to change .
will someone just shut him the fuck up ?
hold on !
hold him , chupa !
come on , man !
put him out of his fucking misery !
don' t you get it ?
you can' t finish him that way !
hold him down !
hold him down , chupa !
move .
back off !
if that was your bloodpack sunday punch ,
we' re in trouble .
this motherfucker left his post .
he just disappeared .
where were you ?
ran into a little reaper action myself .
oh , yeah ?
how little ?
we lost a man .
priest .
you want me to carve his name on your chest ?
let me show you .
saw him moving in the alley and followed it down .
found it just like this .
i think they came through here .
it was trying to crawl back in the culvert .
caught his arm .
been gnawing at it like a coyote .
little boy blue .
it' s already dying .
i need to examine it as quickly as possible .
okay , look for a lever .
let' s open it .
they' ve made contact with the reapers .
any casualties ?
one so far .
it was not ...
nyssa , i trust ?
no .
this a dangerous game you' re playing , damaskinos .
blade is too volatile .
you' re not going to be able to keep manipulating him .
you worry too much .
i' ve been informed by our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted .
you' ve already lost one of your own .
how many more are you willing to sacrifice ?
everyone .
even your own daughter ?
yes .
even her .
recognize this ?
the blood bank .
he' s one of the guards .
so why is he dying ?
what' s killing him ?
time .
his metabolism is burning too fast .
they need fresh blood every couple of hours , or they' il start feeding on themselves .
nomak' s different .
he' s the carrier .
it all started with him .
it' il end with him .
open the mouth , scud .
open the mouth .
b , come on .
sissy .
only the tongue carries the virus .
it is injected through these barbs .
it has bifurcated masseter muscles .
overdeveloped , allowing for a much stronger bite .
the jaw structure remains the same .
but there' s no mandible bone .
squeeze that tooth .
neurotoxin .
probably paralyzes their victim while they feed .
garlic don' t work .
silver , that don' t work .
we got to go with the sunlight , right ?
that' s deadly to us , too .
so let' s see what else we can find .
these things are as different from us as we are from you .
look at that .
the heart is encased in bone .
only the side is vulnerable .
good luck getting a stake through that .
pull a leg off a spider , it keeps moving on its own , essentially trying to walk without a body attached to it .
what are you doing ?
hard wired , right ?
what the fuck is that ?
brain' s dead .
body' s still trying to feed .
we got six hours before sunrise .
be ready by then .
hey ...
what happens at sunrise ?
blade , i' m talking to you .
what happens at sunrise ?
we hunt .
in broad daylight ?
you got be joking .
you better get you some sunscreen , buttercup .
listen , shitkicker .
you' re about one cunt hair away from hillbilly heaven .
i love it when you talk dirty .
sunlight' s the only edge we' ve got .
they' il be more vulnerable then .
and so will we .
let' s be real about one thing
i don' t expect everybody to make it back tomorrow .
remember to protect yourselves ... at all times .
what are you looking for ?
phosphor rods .
if i can suss out the light source maybe i can make some sort of
uv flash bang grenade or something .
it' s been tried already .
yeah , but you didn' t have the scudster working on it then .
blade .
hmm ?
the way you talk to them us .
what is it ?
we are together in this , remember ?
why do you hate us so much ?
it' s fate .
it' s in my blood .
it' s in mine , too .
i' m a pure blood .
i was born a vampire .
you know the thirst better than any of us , shooting that serum of yours .
the only difference between us , is that i made peace with what i am a long time ago .
how long have you known blade , anyway ?
going on 20 years .
he doesn' t talk about the old days that much .
blade doesn' t talk about anything much .
you want to hear something funny ?
blade kind of looks at you like a father figure .
tell me something .
how' d you two hook up ?
i was backpacking .
i met these two chicks , decided to take them back to my tent for a little " three' s company " action .
pretty .
next thing i know , janet and chrissy start tearing chunks out of my stomach .
blade shows up , saves my ass .
everything else just sort of fell into place .
let' s try it .
all right .
maybe i fucked up .
maybe you were right .
all right .
papa' s got a brand new bag .
let me ask one question .
how are we going to find these reapers ?
we won' t have to .
they' il come to us .
what is this shit ?
pheromones .
harvested from the reapers ' adrenal glands .
they' re going to key to it .
they want us to spray on some suckpuppy' s nut juice ?
first use your firearms to drive them back .
then toss your uv grenades .
right on .
this is what we got for the grand finale .
i hot wired a couple of these babies into a nitro vacuum .
just be real careful where you pop your load .
and you , you' re not coming ?
no .
i' m a lover , not a fighter .
uv' s have a 10 second delay .
nyssa ... just remember to take cover .
hey , blade , give me a hand .
you and miss muffet getting a little cozy ?
i wouldn' t worry about that if i were you .
looks to me like you' re getting confused as to which side of the line you' re standing on .
those are real hollow words coming from a man who just spent two years running with the enemy .
and what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
you know , whistler , there' s an old saying
keep your friends close , but keep your enemies closer .
you might want to remember that .
blade , we should split into three units .
we' re trying to attract them , not scare them off .
yeah , well , some of us can' t see in the dark , you fucking nipplehead .
what am i supposed to do ?
bifocals , grandpa .
and try to keep up .
let' s do this .
hey , hillbilly .
what the fuck you doing ?
ain' t nobody here but you ... and us , buttercup .
we lose a partner , and blade loses one !
i' il leave you two lovebirds some time to yourselves .
ah !
i spotted a group in the east tunnel .
i' m prepping the bomb pack .
nyssa .
get out !
right now !
no !
no !
i' il attract them to me .
do what i tell you .
move !
10 ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ... three ... two ... one .
piece of junk .
what the hell is this ?
you trying to stink me to death , old man ?
wait .
you okay ?
yeah .
we got to move .
we got a lot of company .
all units , regroup .
regroup !
eat shit , you ugly motherfuckers !
there' s nobody left !
where' s the bomb pack ?
down that tunnel .
give me the rest of the pheromones .
go down that tunnel !
go , go , go , go !
you obviously ... do not know ... whom you are fucking with !
by the way , blade .
did i happen to mention the bomb lever is stuck ?
suck this !
let' s go !
you want a bite of me ?
well , come on !
come on , motherfucker !
whistler .
wait .
you will survive this only to tell blade ... about this ring .
about the truth .
the truth , old man .
damaskinos ...
nyssa .
you' ve done a great job .
not that great i' d say .
what is it , my daughter ?
they took them .
all our weapons .
even your sword .
somebody' s been keeping tabs on us from inside .
where are we ?
some kind of chamber deep in their lair .
they smashed up everything the workshop , all of it .
they' ve been lying to us from day one .
the reaper strain didn' t evolve ... it was designed .
what ?
designed .
nomak told me .
i saw him back in the sewer .
he let me live .
did he ?
how generous of him .
i brought you here to see the fruits of our labor .
for years i' ve struggled to rid our kind of any hereditary weaknesses .
and so , recombining dna ... was simply the next logical step .
nomak was the first .
a failure .
but in time , there will be a new pure race , begotten from my own flesh , immune to silver , soon even sunlight .
i got a question for you , you lying son of a bitch .
you want to explain how nomak got ahold of this ring ?
i would have thought that was obvious at this point .
i gave it to him , of course .
a gift from father to son .
i thought he' d never leave .
the wolf has lain with the sheep long enough .
reinhardt , you can kiss your ass goodbye .
i' m sorry , man .
b , you' re wasting your time , man .
the bomb' s a dud .
it was never supposed to explode .
it was just supposed to make you feel in control .
you thought you had me on a short leash , didn' t you , jefe ?
much better .
see this ?
i' m one of damaskinos ' familiars .
they needed my help to bring you here to control nomak .
the old fuck , he was always just bait .
i mean , look at him .
he' s your only real weakness , man .
you may be fast , you may be strong , and all that other bullshit , but in the end , b ... you' re just too human !
well , you little shit .
you think they scoped out my security system ?
i let them in , asshole !
i practically handed them the keys .
you heard cue ball , right ?
pretty soon they' re all going to be daywalkers .
when that happens ,
i' d rather be a pet than cattle .
you got me , b ?
what do you think about that ?
two things one ...
i' ve been onto you since they turned you .
and two ... it' s not a dud .
ah , great .
i was just starting to like him .
take him down !
we' re going to harvest your blood , every drop of it .
then bone marrow , organs , everything .
we' il find the missing key to creating daywalkers .
now this might hurt a bit .
nice .
i wonder ... how many vampires he' s killed with this thing .
not nearly enough , fritz .
keep talking , honky tonk .
just makes my sending you to the next world
all the sweeter .
been there , done that .
do your worst , chickenshit .
we' il settle up after .
what else should i find out ?
i trusted you with my men ; with my will ; with my life .
you sent us out there .
you sent me to die .
our enemy saved my life twice , and you have used us your own children .
make no mistake , nyssa , those blood ties mean nothing to me when measured against the ascendancy of our race .
who do you think god really favors in the web ?
the spider , or the fly ?
nomak .
what about him ?
he wants revenge ... on the people ... who created him .
you may be right .
but fortunately for us , he doesn' t know this location .
now ... he does .
what the fuck ?
come on , kid .
don' t you even think about dying on me .
you didn' t give up on me , i won' t give up on you .
come on blade .
blood ...
yeah .
blood .
father !
he' il never enter here .
father !
father !
go on , kid .
go !
get him !
get in there !
hmm .
well ...
like my daddy said before he killed my mom ,
you want anything done right , you got to do it yourself .
he also said
can you blush ?
hey , kid .
i reset the security code .
we' re locked in .
are you insane ?
he' il kill us both .
yes .
isn' t it sad that you die not by the hand of your enemy , but by that of your own children ?
father .
nyssa .
nomak !
blade , it could end right here .
what do you think , huh ?
after all , it looks like i' ve finished my father' s job .
it' s strange .
it hurts ... it hurts no more .
it won' t be long .
i can already feel it burning inside of me .
i want to die while i' m still a vampire .
i want to see the sun .
by booth number three .
enjoy , man .
are you sure that the girls are live ?
last time i checked .
thank you .
a couple of razor blades , just in case ...
you didn' t think i forgot about you , did you ?
