welcome to l. a. ' s automated traffic surveillance and control operations center .

safe popped by 8 : 25 .
loaded by 8 : 35 , out the door by 8 : 45 .
straight to union station .
only green lights on your route .
the rest of the city' s red .
cops are stuck in the traffic , like everyone else .
train leaves at 1 0 : 00 .
cars have to be on the carrier by 9 : 30 .
timing' s got to be dead on .
let' s get ready .
let' s get it .
wow , that is a nice car .
sorry , rob .
coast is clear , guys .
this is it , guys .
moment of truth .
what the hell is this ?
shit !
steve' s neighbor' s throwing a party .
are you here for the , uh , baker party , sir ?
no .
we' re not blowing any gates tonight , guys .
too many witnesses .
stella .
i know , i know .
i' m late for my date .
yeah , and you got to be charming .
you' il need him to ask you out again .
sorry .
let' s get out of the street .
i really can' t imagine you doing that .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
well , you don' t really seem
iike the adventurous type , you know ?
don' t let the cable uniform , you know , throw you .
i wasn' t making assumptions .
i' ve made some assumptions about you .
oh , really ?
and ?
well ... you' re just going to have to wait and see .
why wait ?
let' s get a check .
let' s go back to my place .
no assumptions ...
not tonight .
it' s late .
i should go home .
what , you have a cable company curfew ?
no , but i' ve made some bad calls in the past .
hey .
we should take this maybe a little slower , you know ?
this lovely dinner , sparkling conversation you still don' t trust me ?
oh , i trust everyone .
it' s the devil inside them i don' t trust .
it' s an interesting saying .
it' s charming .
where' d you pick that up ?
can' t remember .
really ?
i knew a guy who said it exactly like that .
really ?
yeah .
he' s the only person i' ve ever heard say that .
he said it all the time .
his name was john bridger .
you' re hurting my wrist .
he had a daughter and she was about your age .
let go of my wrist .
i knew that there was something familiar about you .
you' re exactly like your old man , you know that ?
i liked him , too , right from the start .
i liked him right up until the minute i shot him .
who are you working with ?
she' s with us .
gang' s all here .
you know , the only thing worse than a thief , bendel ?
a coward .
then you should have seen the way your daddy begged for his life .
it' s not worth it .
put a leash on your cat .
hi , steve .
charlie .
not bad , charlie .
really , not bad .
you have no idea how hard it is for me not to reach across this table and kill you with my bare hands .
you know better than that , charlie .
can' t let emotion into these things .
tell me it wasn' t about emotion when you shot john and left us all for dead .
that wasn' t about emotion .
it was about a lot of gold , and i wanted it .
anything you think you deserved , you didn' t .
hey , don' t talk about right and wrong with me , man ,
' cause i just don' t give a shit .
okay ?
you got your cards , i got my cards , we made our play , and i came out on top , okay ?
now if you want to start the game up again , that' s fine with me .
but what , i mean , what is your play here , really ?
i mean , come on , what do you ... what do you think ?
y you' il try to take out my guards , right ?
i have five of them that you don' t know about .
you' il try to have lyle hack the system .
i' il change it again tomorrow morning .
what , what , what was y your final move ?
i mean , you were going to have bridger' s daughter come in and try to crack my safe ?
i mean , that' s ... that' s very poetic and all , but i just don' t see it .
i don' t think she' il get anywhere near it .
same old steve , huh ?
always thinking defensively .
that' s why you' re always number two .
how do you figure that ?
you got no imagination .
couldn' t even decide what to do with all that money .
you had to buy what everybody else wanted .
oh ... well , try this on in your imagination , okay ?
that gold is already gone .
that' s bullshit , steve .
no , really , it' s over charlie .
i' m trying to move the last two bricks .
you want to come after me over a couple of lousy bricks ?
i mean , really , be my guest .
but you' re off to a bad start , you know ?
' cause you just blew the best thing you had going for you .
you just blew the element of surprise .
surprised ?
it' s over when i say it' s over .
are you all right , sir ?
how you doing ?
good ... considering ... considering the fact that i' m doing all of this for a man i barely knew .
you know what bothered me all those years , charlie ?
it was that , whenever he' d call me to tell me that he was on some job ,
i knew you were right there with him .
you got to know him a lot better than i did .
just ' cause he was around me more doesn' t mean he wasn' t thinking about you all the time .
be nice if it was true .
it is true .
he always regretted not having been a good enough father to you , stella .
how do you know that ?
because he told me .
what did you do to your hand ?
i punched steve .
why do you get to punch him and i don' t ?
those hands are way too valuable .
hey .
okay ?
there' il be nothing left of that if you keep rubbing it .
tell mr. frazelli we' il see him at 8 : 00 .
charlie !
he' s flying the coop .
when ?
his security guard called for a private helicopter at 4 : 00 pm .
there' s an armored car service coming to his house at 5 : 00 .
there is a cargo plane scheduled to depart lax at 8 : 00 pm to mexico city .
what if he' s moving the safe as a diversion ?
we crack it , it' s empty , the gold' s somewhere else .
steve' s not about to let that gold out of his sight .
it' s going to be in that truck and he' s going to be watching it every step of the way from the helicopter .
so the gold' s headed to mexico .
who knows where ?
they could change the flight plan in midair .
slow down , slow down .
you guys are looking at this the wrong way .
this is good news for us .
charlie , what do you mean , " good news " ?
we' ve been trying to get to the gold in the safe , now the safe is coming to us .
we' re going to boost it in transit .
charlie , it could take a dozen different routes to the airport .
we have no idea which one .
we can' t take out an armored truck during rush hour .
we' re already set up to do it .
napster , gridlock every route except for the one we choose .
force that truck to go exactly where we want it to go .
where do we want it to go ?
we can' t have a shoot out with armed guards .
we' d lose .
we do it like the ltalian job .
hello ?
why' d you do it ?
do what ?
yevhen .
you didn' t have to clip him .
whoa , whoa .
what are you talking about ?
we didn' t clip anybody .
yevhen' s cousin is under the distinct impression that you did .
why does he think that ?
because you want to know about the gold with the balinese dancer .
you told him that ?
listen to me , man .
if there' s one thing that i know is never to mess with mother nature , mother in laws or mother freakin ' ukrainians .
look , i need a favor .
yeah .
had a hiccup last night .
could use some help .
want hands on this time .
you interested ?
could be .
but i don' t like to be kept in the dark .
if i' m in , i' m in .
okay , you' re in .
all right .
what do you think , charlie ?
this' il work .
let' s go .
you' re amazing .
it' s a work of genius .
uh huh .
you okay ?
just give me a moment .
now ?
i' m about to insert this pin into this detonator tube , and if the brass touches the sides , we' il both be the last people we ever see .
