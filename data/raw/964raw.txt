i wanted us to write our own vows for the wedding , and now i can' t do mine .

how do you explain love ?
uh , i i guess i wouldn' t know .
i don' t think i' ve ever felt that way about a guy .
oh , someday you will .

your letter made a great impression on coach marshall when he read it .
let me just refresh your memory , partner .
dear steve ,
i will be forever in your debt if you teach me to dance like you did in the gay bar .
i put serious thought into that letter .

i' m trying not to lose my head . " uh huh .
<i>uh</ i> <i>huh . </ i>
<i>[ laughs ] </ i>

i just don' t feel quite like a virgin in it .
oh !
so , you guys have to be psyched to be done with college .
i mean , i swear , i' m running out of room in my brain for everything .
there' s always room for plato and aristotle .
some of my favorites .
excuse me , guys .
finch , she thinks you were being sarcastic .
<i>[ stifler ] </ i>
<i>okay .
it' s so good to see you . </ i>
<i>you want some help ? </ i>

the dads aren' t here yet ?
i' il go find him .

hey , paul .
hey , kevin .
<i>mom , i want you to meet steven . </ i>
he' s friends ofjim' s and mine and , oh , everyone' s .
you look very familiar , steven .

michelle' s grandmother' s ... my mother' s ... wedding ring .
isn' t that precious ?
but since all of you are the best man ,
i don' t know who should ho hold onto it .
i think it' s best if i ...
oh , um ...
i think you should get to know us first and then decide .
you are such a gentleman , steve .
i hear that all the time , but it never gets old .
aw .
hey , paul , uh , do you have a camera ?
how thoughtful .
i must have forgotten my camera at home , steven .
oh , m maybe you could take , like , a mental note .
i won' t forget this moment .
i bet you won' t .
would you care to join us ?
i would love to .

i' m gonna teach you to dance like a " baryshiniankov .
oh , yeah .
he is pretty good .
<i>jim , he' s not doing it to be nice . </ i>
<i>he' s doing it to bone cadence . </ i>
look , maybe we should give him a chance .
you know , i think ...
i think ... that underneath all the fucks and shits and blow mes , there' s a very sensitive person who is just thirsty for acceptance .
that' s that' s what i think .
oh , jim , you' ve gotta stop masturbating .
it' s melting your brain .
observe the fuckin ' stif meister .
what is his defining characteristic ?
he uses the f word excessively .
thanks , man .
but i also have confidence .
you' re one big floppy cock .
look at you .
you' ve gotta stand like a man .
your posture tells your partner where to go .
okay .
okay .
okay ?
follow my lead .
this is the waltz .
waltz .
okay .
waltz .
okay .
that' s pretty good .
you' re fuckin ' right it' s good .

<i>you know , there' s nothing like</ i> <i>a local pub . </ i>
mm hmm .
it' s like real america ... without all that corporateness and catchy jingles .
well , what' s wrong with a good jingle ?
i think it was voltaire who said ,
ajingle witty proves everything for my friends and i.
cadence .
i didn' t know you were gonna be here .
you' re just in time for voltaire' s greatest hits .
voltaire ?
stifler , please , who was voltaire ?
someone much wiser than you , i' m afraid , finch .
actually , i' m getting a little burned out on all the intellectual stuff .
<i>yeah .
me too . </ i>
being smart is so hard .
i' il give you some intelligence .
voltaire can suck on my balls .
what ?
it' s about time somebody finally came out and said it .
hey , i' m gonna give you a quote to live by .
love life , get paid and then get laid .
that is the basic philosophy of the finch meister .
i like that .
bet you do .
but i don' t know why you do ... because finch meister doesn' t make any friggin ' sense .
sure , it does .
no fuckin ' shit it does .
cadence , let' s leave the " crayton " here , shall we ?
whatever .
fuck it .
i' m walkin ' anyway .
wait .
you know , actually , i think i' m gonna go stretch my legs with the finch meister .
you don' t mind , do you , steven ?
no .
ha !
it' s on like donkey kong , bi i itch .
pack it up , bitch .
i' m on it .
thank you .
so , uh , cadence say anything about me ?
whatever you and finch are pulling , she seems to like you both .
finch .
is she gonna be around tomorrow night ?
no , she' s going up to chicago with michelle for the final dress fitting .
what about her parents ?
i think her mom kind of likes me .
they' re going up north with , uh ... with my parents ... for , uh ... you know , to get things , uh , ready for the rehearsal .
so , uh ...
so that' s where they' il be .
so don' t bother looking for them or anything , you know .
a wedding .
shit .
how do you know she' s the right girl ?
i just do .
i' m a better person when i' m with michelle .
nobody else can ...
<i>no , no , no , shithead . </ i>
you hooked up with one other girl for , what , 10 seconds .
not to mention you passed on nadia .
dumbest fuckin ' thing ever .
you' re like a blind man picking out his favorite porno .
this shit is crazy .

you know , michelle is the only , uh , girl that i' ve ...
i' ve been with .
honestly , now ...
honestly , would you have passed up sex with nadia ?
why ?
did she say something ?
hypothetically , dad .
oh , hypothetically .
well , i mean , you know , jim , i' m a married man .
i' m ...
if lf lf you weren' t married .
she' s a college girl .
if you were a college guy .
in a heartbeat .
oh , yeah .
mm hmm .
first of all , what what you' re feeling is so normal and perfectly natural .
marriage is not about , uh , animal lusting and and kinky sex games .
it' s not so much about who' s the dog and who' s the fire hydrant tonight .
it' s it' s deeper than that .
the longer a marriage lasts , uh , the longer you can go , uh , without sex .
but when that magic night does happen , uh , it' s it' s all the more meaningful .
and let me tell you , your mother , bless her , can still make me , uh , squeal like a pig .
uh , and i mean that in the good sense , son .
do you follow what i' m saying ?
you understand where i' m going ?
i do .
i , uh ...
i think i , uh ...

i don' t know how , but you do .
everything is gonna be fine .
yeah .
um , uh , you need to come into the kitchen right now .

thanks for coming out here and meeting me .

i just have a couple of things i wanna say .
this sucks .
did i say that out loud ?
keep going .
it' s good .
now , i thought about what you said , kev .
about , uh , about how my problems always seem to work out .
and i realized that the reason things always work out ... is because you guys have always been there to back me up .
even you , stifler .
for the first time in my life ...
i actually feel like i can' t mess anything up .
which is pretty amazing .

i i guess i just wanted to say thank you .

<i>love is very difficult</ i> <i>to describe . </ i>

i mean , it' s your wedding .
and it' s natural .
it' s perfectly natural .
but it' s impossible to describe a feeling .
okay , first , nothing is impossible .
so , let' s not focus on that .
why do you think , michelle , they call it " making love " ?
i don' t know .
i just call it " boning .
boning .
well , when you' re doing other things with jim ... when you' re not , um , boning ... how does he make you feel ?
horny , like i wanna bone .
but we can' t be boning from sunrise to sunset , dear .
oh , you' ve never tried it ?
i certainly have .
i have .
i' ve boned .
from sunrise right through brunch , on more than one occasion .
but boning aside , um , i think they call it " making love " ... because you have to make love work .
you know , it' s about compromise and sacrifice .
and i thinkjim has sacrificed for you .
my god , he shaved his entire pubic region , which would baffle most cultures around the world .
but he did it , and he did it for you .
you' re right .
love isn' t just a feeling .
it' s shaving your balls .
thanks , dad .
i wouldn' t get into too much detail on that .
excuse me .
pardon me .
