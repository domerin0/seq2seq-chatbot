oh dear , oh dear , oh dear .
what an unforeseeable accident .
that' s not an easy fix , that .
we' re looking at a multiple abrasion friction gash .
i did not know you were a qualified mechanic , dougal .
of course !
if you bring me an air pump , some glue , four watermelons , water skis , a trombone and gobstoppers ,
i might just be able to help you out .
ha , ha !
i am lucky you were here .
will you take care of my things ?
oh , i' il take care of them , all right .
mm !
i think i' il take care of those lollipops first .
then ... ooh , those sherbets .
and ... ooh , those caramel creams .
whoa !
whoooa !
thank you .
thank you .
encore !
encore !
thank you .
so sweet .
now , for my next number , i shall ...
whoa !
help !
oh , dougal !
help !
get me off !
how do i stop this thing ?
please help me !
whoa !
oof !
he' s always got to make a big entrance .
oh dear , that' s not good .
hold on tight , children .
help !
mr rusty !
whoa !
quick !
i can' t get off !
oh , my goodness , it' s out of control !
wh what' s happening ?
this is too wagnerian for words !
oh , florence !
what was that ?
bad trip !
puccini preserve us !
what' s happened to the roundabout ?
ugh !
oh , no .
what' s happening ?
florence !
are you all right ?
dougal !
i' m cold !
don' t worry , florence .
we' il get you out of there .
what on earth shall we do ?
zebedee !
zebedee !
zebedee !
zebedee , thank goodness .
whatever' s the matter , my friends ?
something awful has happened .
look .
oh , no !
i hoped this day would never come .
what , tuesdays ?
but tuesdays are great !
on tuesdays we make cake ...
no dougal .
the day zeebad escapes !
zeebad ?
i thought that was just a shaggy dog story .
i' m afraid not , dougal .
he' s all too real .
cold hearted , tyrannous and cruel .
for thousands of years , he kept our world bound in ice .
and now you' ve released him , he' s free to wield his terrifying power once more .
oooh !
free at last !
it took 10, 000 years , but the best things are worth waiting for .
power .
revenge ... and , er ... more power !
cold .
but not cold enough for my liking .
ha , ha !
soon it will be nice and frozen everywhere , just like it was before zebedee ruined everything .
now , where to begin ?
eh ?
aha !
what' s this ?
ooh , just what i need a henchman !
today one soldier , tomorrow the world !
and then , perhaps , three more soldiers !
focus , zeebad , focus !
i' ve done it !
a lean , mean , fighting machine who' il obey my every command !
eyes right !
quick march !
# he' s a lean , mean , fighting machine
# the real deal , know what i mean ?
# marching along
# well , he' il take you on
# watch out , here he comes
# he' s a fighting machine
argh !
attention !
name ?
sergeant sam , first decorative clockwork regiment , saaaaah !
good !
from now on , your mission is to help me recover three diamonds taken from me by a treacherous thief .
mm .
the road will be hard .
pain , misery and torment will be your constant companion , and your only release will be death !
oh .
er , can i ask about holidays ?
three weeks in summer .
very generous , sir .
not that it will ever be summer again !
oh .
now let' s see what that worm zebedee is up to .
well , well .
he' s got some little friends , has he ?
i' il soon see to them .
to my old lair !
we shall plan our line of attack .
only by returning the enchanted diamonds to their original places on the roundabout will you defeat zeebad .
but if he finds them first , he will use them to freeze the sun !
nothing will grow .
not even grass .
ok , people .
we' ve got a problem .
one of the diamonds is hidden here , on the roundabout .
i must stay behind to guard it .
to find the other two , you will need this map .
you must head north into the mountains .
there is no time to waste .
whoa !
well , i hope you' ve supplied us with an appropriate mode of transportation .
whoops !
ha , ha , i' il just back up .
it' s hardly the orient express , darling !
does it have first class ?
what ?
take good care of this little box of tricks .
it may save you in your hour of need .
florence , hold on .
i' il be back .
i promise .
don' t be too long .
whatever happens , you mustn' t blame yourself .
no , leave that to us .
hm !
all aboard !
don' t worry , children .
our friends will save us .
steam , check .
furnace , check .
pistons , check .
wahey !
sorry .
passengers .
i forgot the passengers .
hello , trees !
hello , birds !
hello , scary freezing mist .
oh , dear .
lucky they can' t hear me .
i wouldn' t want them thinking i' m a scaredy train .
oh , florence .
i wonder where we' re going .
i wonder if they even know .
i wonder if they know that i don' t even know .
oh , this is so exciting !
dougal .
yeah ?
you mustn' t feel guilty just because it' s all your fault .
me ?
oh , sorry , that didn' t come out right .
my fault ?
what did i do ?
what , apart from wrecking the roundabout , trapping florence and the children and causing the escape of a maniac intent on freezing the sun ?
i only wanted to get my teeth into some sweeties .
yeah , it starts with some sweets , man , maybe an iced bun , and before you know it you' re on two bags a day .
i know man , i' ve been there .
maybe you' ve got , like , a problem , my furry friend ?
i have not !
and i' il not rest until i' ve done everything in my power to bake things right .
i mean make things right .
goodness , it' s getting cold .
tell me about it .
i' m freezing my nuts and bolts off here !
i must say , you' re all doing a wonderful job .
keep up the good work .
what' s for dinner anyway ?
i' m famished !
oh , i see , the silent treatment is it ?
huh !
it' s lucky i brought some secret supplies .
mm !
ah , full moon .
they say the full moon puts people in the mood for romance .
what a perfect venue for an open air verdi festival .
people would flock here .
# la la la la la la la !
not even sheep would flock to that noise .
# la la la lee la la lor !
uh oh .
mm ?
that was a close shave .
my gobstoppers !
oh , no !
there' s only one left !
right !
it' s time we all got some beauty sleep .
dylan ?
dylan !
wha ...
what ?
bedtime !
gee , thanks for waking me up to let me know .
someone should keep watch .
i was thinking ...
good of you to offer .
what ?
good night .
good night , darlings .
night night , ermindude .
eh ?
what ?
now my impression of a sleeper train .
wait , wait ...
oh , no .
i' ve run out of toothpaste !
why do i have to be the guard dog ?
what' s wrong with a guard snail or a guard cow or ... ?
who goes there ?
friend or foe ?
or ...
... moose ?
f feeling a bit blue ?
you' re not the only one .
oh , is this a friend of yours ?
i' il take that as a no !
dooougaaal ?
dooougie ?
dougal ?
doooougal ?
dougal ?
doogie ?
doogie , man ?
here , dougal .
here , dougal .
oooh , i' ve found a trail .
maybe it' il lead us to him .
or maybe it' il lead us to that ... ... moose .
i think he' s trying to tell us something .
have you seen our friend dougal ?
big black nose , looks like a bad hair day on legs ?
you' re wasting your time , brian .
whoever heard of a talking moose ?
says the opera singing cow .
look , i think he wants us to follow him .
come on !
as fast as you can !
now , you dim witted draft excluder , tell me everything .
well , i was a very happy puppy .
my first memories are of catching tennis balls with florence .
then , as i grew up , she ...
no , you follicly enhanced freak !
tell me about the diamonds , or i' il make you wish you' d packed a pooper scooper !
me ?
i don' t know anything .
i don' t even have the map .
so , there' s a map , eh ?
no , no , no , no ...
no map .
well , of course they wouldn' t trust you with it .
you' re just a silly little dog .
you' d probably bury it or chew it !
so , who does have the map ?
eh ?
i' il never tell !
oh , no ?
sam , stop mincing around with that duster .
torture this boarding house for fleas until he tells us everything .
yes , sir !
right , then .
torture !
look , this is all a bit new to me , so , erm ... what is it you' re most afraid of ?
erm ...
hm .
it won' t be long now until i have my full powers back .
then i ...
oh , no !
no , no !
not that !
good sam !
enjoy yourself !
no , please !
ooh , no more !
26 ...
ooh , i can' t stand it !
27 ...
he can' t possibly take much more of this !
you' ve eaten 27 sugar cubes !
you' il have to make me eat 100 before i tell you anything !
no , no !
please !
soon the diamonds will be mine and i' il be able to turn this hideous green planet into a lovely frozen wasteland .
this is terrible !
no , you mustn' t !
little more . ... don' t you ?
how long will this take ?
i' m working ...
eh ?
ooh , ow !
you' re killing me !
ooh !
argh !
ooh , that sounded painful !
hee , hee !
excellent work , sam .
no !
leave me alone , you evil fiend !
what are you talking about ?
it' s me ermintrude .
could you come back in five minutes ?
i was just starting to enjoy myself .
oh , come on , dougal .
full steam backwards !
finish him off , sam .
it' s time we ...
the dog !
what have you done with him , you idiot ?
ooh ...
well , sir , i got flattened by a flying cow .
oooh !
not so fast !
ow !
ooh , let go of my tail , you br brute .
ermintrude !
faster !
aaaagh !
oooow !
back it up , back it up !
how nice of you to drop in .
pull !
sorry , can' t stay long .
aaaagh !
uh oh !
whiplash !
hello .
ah , she looks a lot better from this angle .
she' il look a lot better when she' s being served with a side order of fries .
after them !
this is cold and very unpleasant .
where are we ?
keep going !
keep going !
there must be another way .
yeah , man .
yeah , yeah .
keep going , people .
whoa !
i' m a train , not a snowboard !
# ba ba ba bom
# keep spinnin ' , spinnin ' around
# ba ba ba bom
# keep spinnin ' , spinnin ' around
# ba ba ba bom
# keep spinnin ' , spinnin ' around
# ba ba ba bom
# keep spinnin ' , spinnin ' around
# a a a ah
# ba ba ba bom
aagh !
i was made to shunt ... not to ski !
aaargh !
whoa , man , that' s deep .
i think we' ve reached the end of the line .
you took the words right out of my mouth .
sam , your sword !
sir !
en garde !
hey , man , give peace a chance .
nobody can save you now .
zebedee !
zededee !
zebedeeeee !
you !
so we meet again .
indeed .
i' ve waited 10, 000 years for my revenge .
and , as you know , revenge is a dish best served cold .
some like it hot , zeebad !
i' ve still got some spring in my step , zeebad .
well done , zebedee !
oh , no .
i think the spring has sprung .
oi !
where do you think you lot are going ?
sam ?
sam !
stop !
think about what you' re doing .
it' s not my job to think .
i' m a soldier .
i' m just following orders .
you may wear a soldier' s uniform , sam , but it' s what' s inside that counts .
look out !
ugh !
blimey .
run !
run !
come on , gang , here' s our chance .
argh !
move that moustache !
oops , nearly a toothpick .
your days in the sun are over , zebedee , you benevolent bed spring !
now it' s time for zeebad !
stop !
zebedee' s in trouble !
no , save yourselves !
what shall we do ?
what shall we do ?
well , we can' t leave him .
to the rescue !
you' ve got to find the diamonds !
ah , so it ends .
my nemesis finally vanquished forever .
get the diamonds !
noooooo !
we have no choice .
we must leave now .
there' s nothing more we can do here .
come on , doog .
quick .
it' s almost enough to make one weep , if only i wasn' t so very , very happy .
ha , ha !
now nothing can stand in my way !
no , sam .
it' s all in the back of the throat .
right now , even if i could speak , i wouldn' t know what to say .
i can' t believe he' s really gone .
zeb' s dead , baby .
zeb' s dead .
and now who' s going to help florence and the children ?
who' s going to help us ?
be strong , ermintrude .
we have to be brave and find the diamonds .
after all , that was zebedee' s dying wish .
it' s no good , man .
without zebedee , we' re nothing .
no , brian' s right .
we' re gonna save our world .
now where' s the map ?
there !
head for the tallest mountain in that range .
that' s the spirit , brian !
nothing short of a sea of boiling lava will keep me from that diamond now .
oh , sugar .
well , that' s where the diamond is .
who' s going to get it ?
ah , well , diamonds are a girl' s best friend .
off you trot , ermintrude .
men are supposed to give ladies diamonds .
not the other way round .
hey , i thought dogs were supposed to fetch .
my forte' s always been " sit , dougal " .
that , and " stay , dougal , stay " .
dylan ... surely it' s only a short hop for such a brave bunny .
more like a long drop for a dumb rabbit .
quiet !
ahem .
there' s a bridge over there .
i think i ought to keep a lookout here while you lot cross to the other s ...
he' s not a dog , he' s a chicken .
all right , all right .
i understand .
you don' t want to go without your leader .
talk about wag your own tail .
oooh , i' m scared of heights .
don' t worry about them it' s the widths you have to worry about .
this is gonna be easy .
careful !
easy does it .
a bit close to the edge .
just don' t look down .
look straight ahead .
whoa !
ooh , hot rocks , man !
keep your eyes on the road !
wha ...
what road , man ?
i' m on it .
don' t worry .
why have you stopped ?
one step at a time .
oh , yeah , oh ...
there we go .
this is gonna be easy .
argh !
noooo !
dylan !
do something !
can' t one of you just hop out and push ?
whoa .
i' m totally not train trained .
that' s not helping , dylan !
ah , for a nice siding and a can of warm oil .
no need to panic .
now .
now is a good time to panic .
rock and roll , man !
brilliant .
i' ve had it with public transport !
the diamond !
wo ow !
and there you have it !
i have led you all to the first diamond !
wow !
dylan , do the honours , would you ?
yeah .
cool .
er , i i think this thing needs tuning .
something' s happening !
my feet are frozen .
i' m cold .
come on , children .
we ...
we have to be brave .
look !
it' s florence !
strange .
for a second there , i thought i heard ...
oh ...
i must be going mad .
she can hear me !
florence !
it' s me , dougal .
i' ve come to save you !
dougal ?
is that you ?
what ?
no !
dougal ?
she' s fading !
dougal !
it' s only been one day and the children are freezing fast .
concerned for your friends ?
ha , ha , ha !
and i' il take the map too , please .
wait , how do you know there' s a ...
well , they tortured it out of me !
give me that map !
please !
over my dead body !
sam , get out the garlic butter !
i' m feeling a little peckish .
you' re bluffing .
try me , you spineless slime spreader !
leave him alone !
take the map .
you' re a despicable fiend !
i know , ha , ha , ha .
it' s a gift , really .
compassion is such a weakness .
sorry we can' t stay but you know how it is .
people to rule , places to freeze .
hup , hup , hup !
come on , imbecile , we have to destroy the bridge !
so long , suckers !
hold up .
aaaagh !
oh !
good work , soldier !
there' s hope for you yet .
thank you , sir !
cor !
man , they don' t make crumbling rock causeways like they used to .
is there any chance it will , like , grow back ?
at least we' il be nice and warm .
oh , tragedy !
we' re doomed !
and just as i was about to make it big .
you are big .
thank you , dougal .
but i was hoping the peak of a volcano wouldn' t be the pinnacle of my career .
chill out , guys .
i' ve got something stashed that just might help .
dylan , we don' t have time to experiment with recreational activities .
zebedee' s magic box !
of course !
now , if i could just get my head round how to work this thing .
did zebedee give anyone the instructions ?
just press the button !
whoa !
a boat .
brilliant .
it' il be plain sailing from here on in .
wait !
i' ve got it .
the tents !
he' s really lost it this time .
oh , this heat is making my horns curl !
i must look a sight .
oh , no , ermintrude .
i think you look ...
that is , i find you ...
look ... in case we don' t make it out of here , i just want you to know that ...
all aboard !
this is amazing !
i' ve never been this high before .
in fact , i' ve never been off the ground before .
what are we doing ?
well done , dylan .
a balloon escape .
my !
you are clever .
it' s all about altitude over attitude , ermindude .
excuse me , but there' s still one small problem .
we have no idea where we' re going .
brian' s right .
we could drift around for years !
or we could just , like , follow them .
faster , sam .
you row like a milkmaid !
ease up , sir .
now those pesky thieves are out the way , what' s the big rush ?
sam , imagine if you' d waited 10, 000 years to come home to your frozen kingdom , only to find a world covered in flowers and animals and sunshine and ...
and trees and rainbows and tiny little bunny rabbits .
shut up and row , you wooden windbag !
soon i will have the second diamond , and all those stranded simpletons will have is each other ... for dinner !
sam , you' re ruining the moment .
sorry , sir .
is that the milky way , ermintrude ?
brian !
you should never ask a lady anything so personal !
what ?
aren' t the stars beautiful ?
so beautiful .
wouldn' t you love to be one of them ?
i' d give anything .
you' d make a wonderful star .
oh , i dare say you' re right .
so serene .
so heavenly .
so admired and adored .
always looking down on everyone .
oooh , yes !
we should get some sleep , man .
honestly , is that all you ever think about ?
sure .
whenever i' m awake .
i can' t sleep .
i' m too worried about my florence .
she' s so helpless without me .
she must be petrified .
pets ?
fried ?
bad karma .
exactly .
i calm her down .
the truth is , i do everything for her .
her life would be quite empty without me there .
whoa ...
don' t toast the hamsters , dude .
during scary thunderstorms , she insists i climb into bed with her ... for her protection .
and she just loves to throw a tennis ball .
who' s always there to bring it back so she can have the pleasure of throwing it again ?
i' m telling you , dylan .
i bet she really misses that .
really , really , really missing that .
florence ?
florence !

something strange is definitely afoot .
yeah , it' s definitely a foot .
ok , everybody , prepare to land .
can' t be far now .
this is definitely the place .
let' s press on .
ow !
hold up , sir .
after me , sir .
it could be dangerous , and i' ve got a sixth sense for ...
try concentrating on the other five and you might not lose your head .
now , what do we have here ?
aha !
the whole place is booby trapped .
so , what do we do now , boss ?
land ho !
hmm .
thank goodness !
i can' t wait to feel earth beneath my hooves .
any idea how we can land this thing ?
they' re still alive !
well , boil my busby !
no matter .
all that booby traps require are a bunch of boobies .
we' il let them clear the way , then we can just stroll in .
come on !
ooh !
lower , lower .
loads of room !
lower .
here comes a ...
stop ! ... nice smooth ... ... crash .
ow !
ooh !
just in time for lunch .
and it looks like you' re on the menu .
i wonder where zeebad is .
we must have overtaken him .
nice one , train !
no worries , rabbit .
wait here and keep your pistons pumping .
we may need to make a quick getaway .
hey , let' s make it really quick and go now .
i wonder what these symbols mean .
it' s probably the ancient equivalent of a welcome mat ...
oh !
oh , where are my manners ?
ladies first .
no , after you .
age before beauty , dear .
oh , for heaven' s sake , i' il go .
don' t look so shell shocked , ermintrude .
i may be slow but i can still take the lead .
just follow my trail .
well , look who' s beginning to grow a spine .
spine ?
what do you mean " spine " ?
i' m always the first into the fray !
those lazy tykes .
i' m the only one who does anything around here !
it' s " brian do this , brian do that .
yes , sir .
no , sir .
three bags full , sir .
they treat me like a slave !
it' s a disgrace .
where' s my sugar ?
where' s my grass ?
they must think i' m a soft touch .
but i always go crawling back .
well , come on , it' s all clear .
let' s go .
i never thought i' d say this but ... what a snail !
ok , wait here .
that' s what they said .
wait .
urgh !
i i don' t like this .
i don' t like this .
what' s this ?
i' il go into the tunnel .
i' m a train .
i like tunnels .
i' il wait here , that' s it , yeah .
i' il wait just ...
oooh !
mmm ...
hey !
whoa !
anyone find the diamonds ?
oh , doog , man .
don' t you know rabbits are kind of jumpy ?
i don' t see any clues .
we must be in the wrong place .
oooh , a throne the perfect place to enjoy my last gobstopper .
oh , great , a recline button !
ooooh !
whoaaa !
the diamond !
cool light show , man .
hello , pretty lasers .

aah ...
# da daaa !

oooh !

dylan ... can you beat them up ?
sorry , i don' t believe in violence .

i' m a train , i have a whistle .
it' s dark down here .
lucky i have tunnel vision , hee , hee !
whoa !
big engine , alloy wheels ...
you wouldn' t want to be on the wrong end of that .
whoa .
uh oh !
so ...
the fearless warrior of legend has come to claim the diamond !
erm , no actually , the fearless warrior couldn' t make it today , so we came instead .
er , we' il drop it in to him on the way home .
look , do you want the diamond or don' t you ?
er , well , if you' re offering ... yes , please !
i' ve got a better idea .
let' s jump him !
chaaaaaa ... ... aaaaaaa ... ... aaaarge !
it was just a thought .
how about ... run away !
oh , no !
aaagh !
he he help !
help !
dogs are meant to eat bones , not the other way around !
huh ?
aaaaargh !
that was quick thinking , dougal .
yeah , well , if you keep your cool and don' t run around like a headless chicken ...
no time for chitchat .
let' s grab that diamond and get out .
it' s gone !
fools !
looking for this ?
you just can' t get the staff these days .
now , do you want to tell me where the third diamond is ?
nope .
resistance is futile !
you' re no match for the great zeebad !
pride comes before a fall .
dougal !
now !
whoa !
hooray !
that' s the last we' il see of them .
oooh ...
euch !
oooh !
ouch !
that took him down a peg or ten !
yeah , man , except you just flushed away diamonds one and two .
so ... where do we go now ?
we must get back to the roundabout as fast as we can .
i know there' s like , " no rest for the wicked " , but i' m one of the good guys and right now i need a siesta .
whoa !
look !
voices !
i knew they' d come to rescue me .
hang on , maybe i' m supposed to be rescuing them .
hey , that sound' s familiar .
typical train .
always turns up when you least expect it .
come on , gang .
in we go .
oh , no .
right , now , let' s get out of here .
oh , do slow down , you' re making my milk churn .
are you kidding ?
we' re moving at a snail' s pace !
snail' s pace suits me just fine .
oh , ermintrude !
that' s the sweetest thing you' ve ever said .
relax , doogie .
soon this whole crazy trip will be behind us .
behind us !
that' s what i said , man .
no !
behind us !
faster !
faster !
duck !
oof !
i always wanted to be a roller coaster !
whoa !
whoa , dudes !
talk about a near death experience .
i thought i saw the light at the end of the tunnel .
that is the light at the end of the tunnel !
we' re going to be ok !
and zeebad' s still trapped in the temple !
then , like , who' s that , his evil twin , zeebadder ?
where' s my third diamond ?
whoa !
furnace , don' t fail me now !
whoo !
aaagh !
brace yourself , everybody !
whoa !
mind the gap !
hey !
here comes big nose !
somebody do something !
hey , this must be some kinda anti spring device .
this' il slow zeebad down .
really ?
aaaagh !
or it could be an ejector seat .
what the devil was that ?
what happened ?
why am i blind ?
did we reach the roundabout yet ?
so that' s where you' re headed !
the roundabout !
and that' s where i' il find my diamond !
so long , slimeball !
aaagh !
ooooh ...
sam , get up on the roof and dispose of the prisoner .
dispose of a prisoner ?

geneva convention .

i' m unconventional !
un con ventional .
ha , ha , ha !

aaaargh !

brian !

whoa !
welcome aboard !
ermintrude , you saved me !
don' t cross me , you tarted up tin opener !
faster , you lily livered traitor !
i want that diamond !
more coal !
oh !
no !
trouble dead ahead !
that' s my line !
argh !
now , this is what happens when you don' t brush regularly !
sir !
the pressure it' s too much !
i know , i know !
sometimes i feel i' m going quite insane !
no , sir , it' s the boiler !
it' s ...
thank goodness !
we' re safe !
i call that letting off steam !
hurrah !
whoa !
i can fly y y !
no , i can' t .
aaaargh !
oh , that' s enough flying for one day !
we' ve got to get to the roundabout before zeebad .
hang on , zeebad doesn' t know the diamond' s at the roundabout .
erm ...
well , that' s not strictly true ...
back there , on the train ...
i i was confused and it ... it just slipped out .
brian , man !
well there' s no use crying over spilt milk .
that' s easy for you to say .
come on , people .
to the train !
ow !
whoa .
looks like this service has been cancelled .
are you all right ?
yeah .
delays look likely .
i think i' ve pulled a piston .
ow !
nope , it' s not gonna happen .
oh , poor trainy !
oh , the sun' s setting .
we' il just have to make it under our own steam .
goodbye for now , old buddy .
you can make it .
just follow our tracks .
don' t worry about me .
you go on , find the diamond .
on second thoughts ...
what about me ?
wretched machines !
i must reach the roundabout before ...
ooh , sir !
medic needed .
sos .
mayday .
oooh ...
me ?
help you ?
you treacherous mollusc sparing disco dolly !
your tour of duty is over .
you can' t leave an injured soldier , sir .
can' t i ?
just watch me .
wait !
come back !
evil villains ... can be so cruel .
i can' t go on .
we' ve been walking for hours .
it' s so c c cold .
i can' t feel my limb .
but florence ... and the children .
if we don' t get there soon , they' il be frozen stiff .
oh , the cruel hands of time !
but if it ... if it wasn' t for time , everything would , like , happen at once .
wait .
what' s that ?
footprints !
maybe they' il lead us back to the village .
but , like , what kinda freaky creatures would leave prints like these ?
they must be exhausted too .
one of them seems to be crawling along the ground .
i prefer the term gliding .
oh , no !
they' re ours !
oh , no !
no , no !
well , that' s it , man .
it' s time for the big sleep .
we did our best .
but our best wasn' t good enough .
oh ...
oh , it' s the final curtain .
no .
we mustn' t sleep .
it' s too cold .
it' s too cold .
we mustn' t ...
florence ...
doooougaaaal !
dougal ?
florence !
you' re ok !
i' m more than ok .
i' m swee eeet .
but what about the roundabout ?
the children ?
huddled .
freezing .
don' t worry , dougal .
you' re with me now ... in sugar paradise !
look .
sweets for my sweet dougal .
and you can eat as much as you like !
n no , this isn' t right !
i must be going nuts .
i have to wake up .

florence !

it was just a dream .
florence !
flore eeeeence !
come on .

no way , man .
i' m in a higher state of unconsciousness .
it' s getting light and we' re still completely lost .
i' m not so sure we are .
oh !
whoa , that was some serious sleepwalking .
look !
look , look , look !
quick !
come and have a look !
look at that !
is that really what i think it is ?
home ?
hm !
curses !
the diamond must be here somewhere !
zeebad !
you !
this roundabout ain' t big enough for the both of us !
when i leave someone for dead , i expect them to die .
can' t you even do that right ?
eh ?
oh , i haven' t done anything right since i left the roundabout .
now it' s time for me to resume my post .
you ?
you were on the roundabout ?
yeah , i was .
guarding it from the likes of you .
ha !
look at the state of you !
you couldn' t guard a boiled egg !
it' s what' s inside that counts !
chaaaaarge !
ugh !
ooh ...
ooh !
the diamond !
oooh , zebedee , you cunning swine .
and to think , i nearly abandoned it when i left you to die .
ooh , the irony !
now , time for the big chill !
this can' t be our village .
i don' t recognise a thing .
yeah , like , maybe we took a wrong turn , doog .
no , no , this is definitely it .
if we go past this white thingy and by this white bit ... just round the corner should be the ...
also sprach zarathustra

zeebad !
ah , perfect !
you' ve arrived just in time for the finale .
so long , sunshine !
florence !
oh , florence !
oh , no , no , no , no , no !
this is all my fault .
if only i hadn' t been so greedy and stupid .
farewell , then , dylan .
goodbye , dear brian .
er ...
ermintrude , before we freeze , there' s something i' ve been t trying to t tell you ...
this guy is seriously messing with my karma !
eat this , you jumped up jack in the box !

whoa !
whoa !
aaaaaaaagh !
wait a minute .

oh !
oooh , nice catch , zeebad !
now let' s get the final ... diamond !
touch it and you' re toast .
you don' t scare me !
you' re just a big , blue bully .
now the tables have turned and all we need do is put this last diamond back on ...
oops .
here comes a home run !
not again !
argh !
victory !
so close and yet so ... far out !
nice try for a bunch of dumb animals !
but now it' s closing time at the zoo .
zebedee' s magic box !
huh ?
ya !
it d doesn' t work .

oooooh !
zebedee' s toys can' t help you now .

but where' s florence ?
florence ?
florence !
florence , can you hear me ?

florence !
my lovely florence !

she' s alive !
oh , florence !
i thought i' d lost you forever !
and i thought i' d lost you too , dougal .
but you saved my life .
and everyone else' s .
oh , stop it .
it' s what any incredibly heroic dog would do .
oh ?
so you don' t want a ...
little reward ?
oh , no .
i' ve learnt my lesson .
i' m not having anything more to do with lollipops .
or gobstoppers .
or toffees .
but wait , where' s zebedee ?
zebedee !
bravo , my friends .
i always knew you could do it !
but we thought you were dead !
dead ?
nonsense , dougal !
everyone knows that after winter it' s time for spring !
come on , everyone .
to the roundabout !
# sugar sugar
oh , no !
how come it' s not moving ?
it' s like stuck , man .
what' s wrong with the roundabout ?
zebedee ?
don' t you remember ?
the roundabout' s still missing something .
or should i say ... someone ?
sam ?
but that' s zeebad' s henchman !
he tortured me !
don' t be too hard on him .
sam too was a victim of zeebad' s maniacal magic .
it' s time for you to return where you belong , sam .
# sugar
