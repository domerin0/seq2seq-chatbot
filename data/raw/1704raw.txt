klng' s game
goodbye , and thanks .
bye .
you , too ...
i' il see you later .
we' re going to win this time .
damn right we are !
we did okay , didn' t we ?
as usual .
let' s get out of here , klaus .
you were dreaming of cigarettes during the whole speech .
i noticed you drumming your fingers .
what can i do ?
instead of behaving like a little boy who steals a whiff in the bathroom .
i can' t do that .
i' m a role model for the non smoking lobby .
a bona fide quitter ...
klaus , have you got a light ?
and about saturday ...
kiddie hits iv .
including
hi , honey .
hi there .
you smell sweaty !
nice , isn' t it ?
dad , can i have the new all stars cd ?
don' t you have it already ?
that' s no .
3 .
this is no .
4 .
so you just came to pester me ?
not because you' re happy to see me ?
julie speaking .
don' t forget to pick her up .
i can take a message .
daddy , it was your boss .
he wants you in his office right away .
aksel bruun' s condition is critical .
his wife gitte suffered minor injuries .
the centre party is in the lead according to the latest polls .
11 days prior to the election , a coalition with the liberals looks ...
wait 10 minutes before leaving .
okay .
i' il see you there .
the timing couldn' t be any worse !
i' m supposed to be there in ...
no , mads hates flying .
at noon .
yes , okay ...
i can' t help wonder what' il happen , if aksel dies ?
hey !
this is a non smoker .
i hadn' t imagined i' d get the position in this way .
no one says you have to accept it .
no , i' il wait .
i' il wait ...
fine .
one second , torp .
it was going to be the biggest landslide victory in 25 years .
then he crashes at the finish line .
it' s crazy .
how long have you been with us ?
four and a half months .
and you want to be transferred to parliament ?
yeah , this is he .
do you have a moment ?
okay , thanks .
bye .
i thought i' d let you have a shot at it for a couple of days .
but you should know that some of your colleagues will get pissed off .
why ?
they' il think it' s because your dad is former minister of justice .
well , is it ?
i can' t deny that you have connections i could use ?
i was 10 the last time i was in there .
but they know who you are .
some of them might , i guess .
any news ?
how is aksel doing ?
the hospital won' t comment .
at the family' s request .
have we got anything if he dies ?
an obituary was written last year .
can the centre party win if he dies ?
it' s possible .
who' s set to take over for him ?
lone kjeldsen ?
isn' t that premature speculation ?
lone kjeldsen ?
oh , god !
can we print that ?
if bruun dies , kjeldsen takes over
and becomes our first woman prime minister .
double check it with our sources ,
i wouldn' t want them to think we have an opinion ...
why are you here , torp ?
vestgaard sent me to parliament for a couple of days .
nice to know .
lars , you can use an extra guy , no ?
well , sure ...
why not ?
erik ...
how is aksel doing ?
he' s fine .
you just take it easy .
i' il handle everything .
here you go .
no .
the name is torp .
that' s what it says .
no , it says trop .
t o r p.
are you gunnar torp' s son ?
yes .
you should fit right in .
button it , moll .
what do you mean by that ?
come on .
forget moll .
he thinks he' s the only honest journalist around here .
the rest of us are part of some big conspiracy ...
morning .
turn right here .
i' ve spoken to the doctor , and we' ve agreed
not to comment on aksel' s condition because of his family ...
dreier just came out of the hospital but he won' t comment .
there' s a press conference in five .
ulrik ... and kasper .
the christians won' t get a seat ,
you' il have to settle for the former trainee' s desk .
the name on everyone' s lips is lone kjeldsen , the party spokesman .
we' ve been unable to reach her for a comment at this moment .
she is known as the strong , but sensitive woman in danish politics .
she has been a central figure in the centre party for many years ...
ulrik torp ?
peter schou .
press officer for the centre party .
welcome to the fort .
thanks .
i wanted to see you .
i' m a big fan of your father' s .
if he was still a democrat
i might have switched sides .
how is he ?
life in the corporate world suits him .
i can imagine .
any news about aksel' s condition ?
no .
i don' t know anything .
just trying to keep my mind on the election .
you think the majority will go with lone kjeldsen , if aksel dies ?
she looks pretty strong .
and she' s very good , you know .
if it wasn' t for that stupid " children' s trust " affair ...
" children' s trust " ?
i thought everyone knew about that .
but it' s her husband , not her ...
sorry , i' ve been busy elsewhere .
what story is that ?
lone' s husband , mads kjeldsen .
he' s chairman of " children' s trust " .
the police think he' s bamboozled the board of directors .
bamboozled ?
funds for a hospital in cambodia .
they seem to have disappeared , and the board knew nothing .
it' s not lone' s problem , of course .
why are you giving me this story ?
there' s no story .
welcome !
good luck .
hello , christian .
didn' t they call you ?
who ?
be specific , please .
dreier already started the meeting .
damn !
thank you .
i tried calling you .
what' s this ?
a moment' s silence for the driver .
and aksel ?
we have an agenda , but i' m not sure where to begin .
we need to parcel out aksel' s election meetings
and i suggest we go ahead with ole' s anniversary celebrations
now that the press has been invited .
what do we do , if aksel dies ?
i suggest we give lone our full support for now .
we can always withdraw it later if aksel' s condition improves .
i find it inappropriate to talk of a new chairman the day after the accident .
poor aksel is still helpless and in intensive care .
election is coming up .
we go on tv tomorrow .
and aksel was supposed to appear on " face to face " .
do you want the camera crew to turn up at the hospital , erik ?
i suggest that finsen take over aksel' s interview tomorrow .
if there are no objections , that is .
good .
shall we move on ?
kaj , you wanted to say something about a bypass road ?
bamboozle
sren krogh from fraud squad , please .
yes ?
sren ?
ulrik torp speaking .
i' m busy .
what do you want ?
you' re working on a case involving kjeldsen and " children' s trust " .
who told you that ?
i just need some background info .
i didn' t say there was a case .
just give me an outline .
i know kjeldsen spent a lot of money on a cambodian hospital .
how much ?
more than 10 million .
some of the money has disappeared ?
the hospital was never built .
hello , ulrik torp , daily news .
we already subscribe .
mads kjeldsen , please .
mads has called in sick today .
any idea where i can reach him ?
sorry , i' m not at liberty to say .
listen , i' ve heard that mads misappropriated the trust' s money .
who can i speak to if i want mads ' side of the story ?
i' il check with our pr officer .
thanks .
yes ?
ulrik torp here ...
no , it' s me again .
i' m sorry , but he' s not available at the moment .
when can i catch him ?
sorry , i don' t know .
okay , well , could you ...
sorry , i can' t help you .
right , thank you .
torp ?
children' s trust " on the line .
thanks .
yes ?
hello .
you just called .
i just thought ...
sorry , who is this ?
not over the phone .
could we meet somewhere then ?
yes , here .
but don' t tell anyone you' re a journalist .
i' il be there at 5 . 30 p . m .
i just want to know where you stand .
are you sure ?
lone is on her way .
well , that' s a shame .
but it' s your choice to make ...
bye .
you were at the hospital today ?
yes .
how does it look ?
it could go both ways .
anything else ?
yes .
why' re you drawing things out ?
you know what ?
i was thinking ...
remember that photo from sudan that got an award two years ago ?
a little girl in the sand .
emaciated .
skin and bones .
and right behind her there was a vulture , waiting to eat her .
stop it , stupid !
takes one to know one .
it' s my tree !
julie , calm down .
she' s been so nice .
she' s helped prepare the birthday party .
and i think she' s fallen in love with the neighbour' s son .
no , let me .
go and say hello to your dad .
is he in ?
you know him and his birthdays ...
how long have you been there ?
two and a half years .
i used to work at tuborg .
the water " is what we called it ...
hi !
just carry them down to the basement .
all set for tomorrow ?
not really .
i' m still 25 , but the women don' t seem to notice .
check this out .
parliament !
way to go !
on a trial basis .
you must have some gossip !
is the centre party panicking ?
the story is there .
go for it .
but why did he hand it to me ?
it' s a classic spin .
drown out bad news with bigger news .
we did it with the vedbaek scandal .
poured out all the dirt in two hours .
buried it .
so schou knew mads ' story would emerge during the election ?
but he leaks it now and hopes it drowns out news of aksel' s accident ?
man , i miss the game !
it' s the best thing about parliament .
i envy you .
right ...
daddy , jonas eats worms !
we need to do something ...
yes , we need to buy that cd .
yes , we' il do that tomorrow .
grandpa gave me money for it !
tomorrow , sweetheart !
no , now !
listen , i' il be back in 10 minutes .
what do you do at the trust ?
i' m an accountant .
i don' t feel comfortable about this .
but you called me .
what do you know ?
your boss has spent 13 million on a non existent hospital .
the site is 9, 000 miles away , so it' s hard to check up on things .
how come the board wasn' t informed ?
mads ran the project on his own .
i never saw any of the accounts .
looks pretty bad .
sounds like mads kjeldsen has lined his own pockets .
listen ...
this is off the record , or whatever you call it .
okay ?
i have a lot of respect for mads , so this is hard ...
mads gets these anxiety attacks occasionally , he has to be alone .
and it' s been getting worse he' s had severe depressions
and my guess is that it has affected his judgment .
why doesn' t the board intervene ?
we were about to .
but the police came this morning , and now it' s all happening so quickly .
we were hoping ...
what ?
they came this morning ?
yes .
i guess they' ve known about it for a while ...
dreier , the son of a bitch !
what' s he up to ?
lone must have the party' s complete support .
if we get the mps , we' il get the party too .
then dreier can call her a vulture or whatever .
it won' t matter .
did you talk to kaj ?
i gave him a bypass road for his vote .
that really made his day !
hi , honey .
hi .
hello , everyone .
i thought you were resting ?
don' t patronize me !
i just wanted to see who was paying us a visit .
coffee ?
no .
i' il pop back upstairs .
but let me know if you need anything .
excuse me .
yes ?
hello , ulrik torp , daily news .
no , he' s not here .
can i help you ?
neither mads nor i will comment on filth like that !
hello .
hi , mom !
bye , honey .
i' m off .
sorry !
i had to take over for ole .
it was an emergency .
are you leaving ?
yes , i ...
ulrik t r o p ?
parliament ! ?
only for a couple of days .
but that' s incredible .
i thought one had to wait for years .
yes ...
but one doesn' t .
see you later .
congratulations .
thanks .
bye , julie .
good story , torp .
well written .
a bit heavy on the human interest .
you can' t tell if he' s guilty or not .
but he' s responsible no matter what .
he initiated the project .
and the money can' t just vanish .
my source says that mads lost control because of a depression .
what do you say , boss ?
well done .
front page tomorrrow .
front page ?
can you cut it down to 30 lines ?
according to a recent opinion poll the centre party is still ahead ...
the party' s constituency seems to be behind lone kjeldsen ...
we' ve tried to get a statement from the hospital ...
we' ve asked the centre party for an official comment ...
the party is backing lone kjeldsen ...
all eyes are on the centre party .
the next few days will be crucial .
children' s trust ceo mads kjeldsen was accused of embezzlement .
kjeldsen , who is married to lone kjeldsen of the centre party ...
well , i finally made it into the spotlight ...
... was not available for comment .
morning .
would you fax this to ritzau right away , please .
i can' t do that .
it has to go through peter first .
what' s the number ?
it' s right there .
at the bottom .
right .
what do you think of the lodge ?
the lodge ?
all the journalists , the mps and their spin doctors .
what are you talking about ?
see the journalists over there ?
they' re sucking up to peter schou .
know why ?
cause he could become their prime source after the elections .
absurd , isn' t it ?
all he ever does is smother critical journalism
and yet they hover around him like little flies on a giant turd .
see you , moll .
bon appetit !
torp , you bastard !
tv news has picked up your story .
way to go !
beginner' s luck .
well ...
congratulations .
perhaps not front page material , but anyway ...
say hello to erik .
erik ... ?
torp .
new guy at the daily news .
good god !
ulrik torp .
i can remember when you were this tall .
you were always in the front office , reading donald duck .
the hulk ...
a big , green man .
did gunnar tell you how we spent nights finalizing budget proposals ?
at 5 a . m . he' d order pink champagne , because it had to be something red .
sounds like the old man all right .
we never agreed politically , but we had a lot of fun .
i read your article about lone' s husband .
it' s not what we need right now .
i guess not .
but the truth will out , of course .
we can' t have him bamboozling the board of directors .
torp , have a nice day , and let' s meet after the elections .
christ , that' s about time !
what does jesper say to that ?
what is he ... 15 , right ?
son ...
football ...
knee injury
by the way , did he recover from his knee injury ?
that sounds good .
very good .
well , i wanted to hear if you could round up a couple of voters
and make them write a few letters to the newspapers ?
erik is the incumbent premier ...
lone is losing the party' s backing ...
that kind of thing .
just write the truth .
i really think he' d appreciate that .
excellent !
i' m already looking forward to it .
give my regards to ...
susanne .
bye , bye .
you have an election meeting in 45 minutes .
lone just summoned all mps for a meeting tomorrow
to elect a new chairman .
but she can' t do that without ...
don' t tell me that !
she just did .
she already notified the press .
can' t you see what she is doing ?
we' ve got two positive write ups in the papers today .
i talked to karsten at the city paper .
he calls lone an amateur .
and we' ve only just begun .
are you in control of the ...
aksel situation ?
yes .
they won' t let me see him .
they just say his condition is critical .
what do you mean ?
he may be all right .
or dying .
nothing more specific ?
no .
family' s request , apparently .
but dreier was allowed to see him ?
what the hell is going on ?
environmental crisis in centre party continues
lone kjeldsen' s environmental reform met with skepticism ...
mads kjeldsen .
ulrik torp speaking .
why don' t they make an announcement ?
did you know lone kjeldsen called a meeting to elect a new chairman ?
holy shit !
what the hell is that ?
hotel receipts ...
mads spends sick children' s money on luxury holiday with lone .
somebody thinks you deserve all the best stories , eh ?
it' s from the centre party .
how stupid can they be , infighting during an election campaign ?
aren' t you going to write it ?
leave it !
what' s up , torp ?
how did you know i was here ?
you' re not the only one i know on the force .
there are details in the kjeldsen case that puzzle me .
can' t blame you .
i looked at the file myself ...
and ?
a half built hospital in cambodia ...
floods destroyed a wing last spring .
it' s a mess .
and the missing millions ?
a mess , but there' s no foul play .
i wouldn' t put mads in charge of mowing a lawn , but there' s no case .
listen , i' il keep this off the record
but i need to know how the case ended up on your desk ?
i can' t reveal information about our sources .
the source is the centre party .
who was it ?
dreier ?
peter schou ?
and you never wondered why ?
you just thanked them ?
the top brass say be friendly with the legislative powers ...
i really don' t know why .
they only run our budget .
besides , you ran the story on the front page this morning ...
may i have your autograph ?
will you be cutting school budgets ?
no , we' il give you longer weekends .
take care .
nice meeting you all .
what am i doing here 10 days before an election ?
ulrik torp wants an interview at 5 o' clock .
i' ve booked a room .
he bought it ?
of course .
he' s going to hit us with lone' s holiday story .
initially you act shocked , and then you distance yourself from her .
have we got anything on him ?
i' il dig something up .
hello .
follow me , please .
i' m glad they have someone like you at the daily news .
i' ve read your features on the environment .
great work .
i' m a journalist myself .
did you know that ?
these were aksel' s .
some performance theatre on friday .
life is too short for performance theatre , right ?
i have questions regarding mads kjeldsen .
yes ...
but if lone isn' t involved , it' s not really the party' s business .
i hear lone and mads spent children' s trust funds on a holiday .
i don' t know anything about that .
but it throws a new light on things ...
if it' s true , that is .
actually , i don' t think it is .
i checked .
there' s no evidence company accounts were milked .
you' il have to ask lone about that .
this seems rather convenient for lone' s opponents .
other candidates for the leadership , for example .
are you running by any chance ?
aksel is our chairman , and as long as he' s alive , he' s our man .
but if need be , lone has my full support .
i' ve said so before .
i wouldn' t make a point of repeating it , if i intended to run , would i ?
so you' re not a candidate .
can i quote you on that ?
are you having trouble hearing me ?
i don' t mind repeating it , if you' re that slow .
lone has my full support .
and now i ...
you have to say that , of course .
lone has a small majority in the party and if you say you' re running
they' il smell a rat and elect lone at once ...
aksel or no aksel .
i think we' il stop here .
i really sympathise with the young reporters who come here .
they parade in here with hard ons and front page dreams .
they only last a few months .
i' ve been here for 22 years .
next time you interview me , you behave yourself .
and you treat me with the respect , i deserve .
you are under my roof !
do you understand ?
you still haven' t answered my question .
nice meeting you , torp .
give my best to your dad .
hi , torp .
all right , listen ...
schou leaked the story to the police .
they both said " bamboozled "
as if they' d already worded the headline .
dreier wants to be prime minister , and that' s always been his goal ...
hold on !
dreier , schou ...
they planted the kjeldsen story .
that' s why lone kjeldsen called a meeting tomorrow .
she' s trying to beat them to it .
go easy on the coffee , torp !
the story behind the story ?
lone kjeldsen on holiday sounds better .
why didn' t you come to me with it ?
it' s an important story .
apart from the fact that it' s a big , fat lie .
he never stole the trust' s money .
it' s mud slinging .
lone kjeldsen represents the new party line .
her environmental reform has farmers up in arms .
aksel bruun ...
get to the point , torp .
this isn' t a political rally .
we all know that dreier sided with aksel bruun .
he dug up the mads kjeldsen thing , and handed it to schou .
suddenly the kjeldsens are crooks .
the board says otherwise .
but three members of the board openly back aksel bruun .
they' re lying to help dreier .
aided by the accountant guy .
i didn' t call him .
he called me .
that' s speculation .
there' s no story .
people ought to know their future prime minister .
torp , don' t make this personal .
it' s not your job to fight for justice .
you' il make a lousy ambassador for our readers , if you' re out in the cold .
your taxi is here .
i' il be right there .
so i should suck up to them ?
a politician trying to kill off another ?
happens every day .
it' s taken us years to gain the parliament' s trust .
listen , i have to go .
and the holiday story ?
it' s your story .
if you don' t want to run it , we won' t run it .
forget the dreier witch hunt .
it' s amateurish .
who' s heading the party right now ?
aksel bruun is still our leader .
our deputy chairman stands in for him when he' s away .
will you be wearing that ?
men in dinner jackets .
ladies in dresses .
why not elect kjeldsen now ?
it' s not party procedure .
we have a deputy chairman for a reason .
but had aksel bruun died in the accident , she would be chairman ...
that' s speculation .
i don' t see any reason to discuss ...
honey ?
yes ?
why won' t the doctors say anything ?
i don' t know .
i work at another hospital .
but isn' t it strange ?
yes .
haven' t you got a friend there ?
yes .
lise .
i can' t .
okay .
dreier is stirring .
tomorrow' s editions back him .
one editorial is critical of you .
is mads ' case swinging things ?
no .
you' il be chairman tomorrow .
i promise you .
hans erik ...
i' il call you later .
lone , we' re from the express .
may i get out of my own car ?
did you spend 200, 000 of the children' s trust funds on a holiday ?
who told you that ?
that' s absurd !
did you know that the hospital was never built ?
mads ?
i' m okay .
i can' t hear them , with the shower on .
the money was intended for a hospital in cambodia
but she spent it on a luxury holiday in crete with her husband .
horrible !
ole says the express is on to the story .
did ulrik tell you the good news ?
are you expecting ?
no .
ulrik is reporting from parliament .
well done !
he' s already had a front page story .
is this fish ?
fish doesn' t agree with me .
would you taste it and tell me if it' s fish ?
what the hell is going on ?
schou planted the story for dreier .
dreier wants to be prime minister .
you won' t write that , i hope .
no .
i need more information .
but i have to warn lone .
are you out of your mind ?
you' il ruin your career .
but i' m to blame if she gets bagged .
come on in ...
what do i tell the guests ?
we just took our seats .
i' il be back as soon as possible .
don' t do anything stupid .
simon ... ?
hello ?
why doesn' t anybody tell me anything ?
i want to see my son !
i understand ...
it can' t go on like this .
no .
i' il visit her tomorrow .
thanks .
how is she ?
stop it .
she' s okay .
don' t use that tone !
i' m only asking .
the blg kjeldsen bluff
bulld the hospltal children pay the price
no , move it to the top of the list .
yes , we can .
sure we can do that , michael .
go ahead and do it .
right .
the by pass road .
dear lone kjeldsen , i feel that ...
... anonymous police source ... ... that mads is innocent ...
we can' t announce anything before it' s official .
there' s a heated debate .
it' s difficult to say .
the case is still on going .
so far we' re doing ok in the polls .
fuck the polls !
we need a chairman !
i' d like to discuss it with erik first .
lone , what is it with this holiday thing ?
is it true ?
what do you think ?
i think it' s hot air .
why do you ask then ?
dreier will move in for the kill today .
if i side with you , i need to know .
are your getting cold feet ?
no .
i' il see you downstairs .
right .
hans erik !
look at this .
no comment !
lone , with all due respect it' s difficult for us to support you
with a case like this on the front pages of a leading newspaper .
i maintain that bruun is our chairman , and i move for a vote .
i find it inappropriate of you to bring that front page up .
we' re 9 days from a general election , and you' re running as candidate
fully aware that this scandal could ruin our party .
is that appropriate ?
10 years ago a prime minister lied about some telephone calls .
the entire coalition was split .
and he wasn' t even from our party .
a decade of political darkness followed .
now the tables are finally turning .
we' ve regained voter confidence .
but not if voters turn on the news and see our chairman on a holiday
paid for with funds intended for starving children in cambodia .
we never touched that money .
well , that settles everything then .
don' t take my word for it .
i have a mail from a journalist here .
he describes how this smear campaign is meant to harm me .
and planted by party members , who don' t want me as chairman .
will you pass this around ?
we' il lose this election , if we don' t make a decision now .
and i would like to know if you' re behind me .
or if , as dreier suggests , we should let the tabloids decide .
lone , could i have a word .
not now , christian .
i need to speak to you right now !
well ...
mads has committed suicide .
the centre party still doesn' t know how serious bruun' s condition is .
but this doesn' t prevent erik dreier from going to the theatre .
how can you go out at such a time ?
i' m here on aksel' s behalf .
and i must admit , i' ve always shared his interest in performance theatre .
doesn' t his condition affect you ?
of course it does .
many point to you as the new chairman , and many oppose you .
are you running ?
let' s see what the mps decide .
but i' d like to say that aksel is our leader .
if we win , it' s thanks to him .
and from the country' s largest party to one of the smallest ...
i talked to lise .
from the hospital ?
she says things are unpleasant
bruun has been brain dead since he was admitted on sunday .
there are exceptions , but usually when patients are brain dead
we switch off the life support machines after a couple of hours .
or the next day , if the family needs more time .
they' ve kept him alive for 3 days , although technically , he' s dead .
thanks for coming .
i know you all usually support lone
and some of you believe i planted the story about mads and lone ...
but frankly , i don' t care .
get to the point .
i' m busy .
ole has the figures .
we conducted a poll yesterday . say they would vote for erik today .
is that so ?
they wouldn' t happen to be the members in schou' s files ?
it' s foolish to wrangle over the party leadership .
we take office in a week .
the numbers speak for themselves .
and i can promise you that there will be no infighting , if i' m elected .
there will be room for everyone .
looking forward to meeting the queen , aren' t you ?
why don' t you leave the party , kolt ?
no , i' m serious .
i can' t have a member of my cabinet , slinging accusations all the time .
it' s okay you' ve chosen to be lone' s little puppy until now .
too bad the tables have turned .
you just said there' s room for all .
i don' t mind if you stay .
but all the issues you raise will be shot down .
so why not avoid the humiliation ?
you can' t threaten me like that .
you told mette that bruun was brain dead .
i didn' t expect she' d tell you .
and things are getting unpleasant ?
it' s aksel' s wife ...
she screams simon' s name all night long .
it' s rather unnerving .
simon ?
their son .
he hasn' t visited them yet .
i don' t know why .
why would they keep aksel alive , if he' s technically dead ?
i need to know what' s going on .
nothing ...
hello .
i can' t discuss our patients .
imagine you were the patient and some stranger asked questions ?
i have to go now ...
nice meeting you .
mette speaks so fondly of you .
yes ?
ulla .
daily news .
vestgaard wants to see you , as soon as it' s convenient .
i' il be right over .
come in , torp .
you really screwed up .
does this sound familiar ?
dear lone kjeldsen .
it is my duty to inform you of a conspiracy .
what the hell are you thinking ?
where did you get this ?
that' s irrelevant .
you' ve broken our rules of conduct .
and you can' t prove any of this .
i' ve got evidence that bruun is being kept alive artificially .
listen to yourself !
erik dreier says you' ve been threatening him .
is that true ?
and your colleagues at the fort say you' re uncooperative .
you' re secretive , and you invent your own fantastic allegations .
per , calm down ...
no , wait !
he' s done a lot of damage already .
we can' t have you going it alone .
going it alone ?
dreier wants to be prime minister .
he knows bruun is technically dead .
but he' s been hushing it down .
here we go !
listen to yourself !
if you don' t want me on the story , then put me on something else .
but you need to follow up on this .
you can' t just let it go !
ulrik , i' m really sorry , but ...
we' re going to have to call off our collaboration .
it' s just not working .
will you buy me a cell phone ?
i don' t know , darling .
they have one especially for kids .
it' s called my first phone .
stop it now , julie !
but ...
you watch too many commercials !
damn it !
our 7 year old daughter has become a full fledged consumer .
all because politicians think it' s okay to show that crap on children' s tv .
and why ?
because the companies that scream into her head
pay hundreds of thousands in contributions to the parties .
i want to help you .
people need to know what dreier' s been doing .
if i did that , my career in politics would be over .
isn' t that a price worth paying ?
dreier is no worse than all the other power hungry people .
always thinking of the next fix , and it has to be bigger every time .
we' re all playing the same game .
i' m not playing games .
you' re not ?
if you hadn' t written this story to further your own career ... ... then maybe i wouldn' t have had to bury my husband .
goodbye .
aksel was brain dead on arrival .
i think dreier kept him alive , so he would have time to oust you .
aksel is dead .
they switched off the life support machines this morning .
hey , can i see your id ?
you' re not listed .
what ?
i' ve been here since monday .
write down your name and address
today we lost one of this country' s great political figures .
this morning it was decided to switch off the life support machines
that kept aksel bruun alive since the tragic accident 6 days ago .
we will all miss him .
there' s a memorial service on friday .
the parliamentary group will meet tonight and appoint a new chairman .
why was aksel kept alive when he' s been technically dead since sunday ?
perhaps torp would let me finish according to procedure ?
you said on the news there was hope , although you knew this to be untrue .
aksel' s son , simon , was on a study trip to latin america at the time .
we had to wait for him to be present .
this is standard hospital procedure .
yesterday , simon came home and parted with his father
and this morning aksel found peace .
if that' s all , perhaps i might be allowed to proceed ?
torp ?
hold on a second .
wait , for god' s sake .
i have something to show you .
forget it .
i just got fired .
i heard .
what did you expect ?
school of journalism , class of 1977 .
here , look ...
your editor in chief and dreier were school buddies .
i thought you knew that .
no .
the journalists in parliament can' t see the forest for the trees .
and dreier is one of the star players .
how do you think he feels , when he makes reporters shush each other ?
he' s laughing all the way down to his chauffeur driven car .
the problem is that reporters and politicians are the same .
handsomely paid , living in nice neighbourhoods , promising careers ...
but if they are the same , then who speaks out for the less fortunate ?
if reporters dream of being politicians or spin doctors
or hosting their own crappy tv shows ?
some of the mps have been members of extreme right wing groups .
and how do the papers react to that ?
two fucking lines on page 8 .
the modern average politician is a little man who yearns for power .
if he can' t get his ideology through in some media , he fires the board
and employs all his friends .
the educated are ridiculed .
human rights issues may be questioned .
what does that remind you of ?
the soviet union or nazi germany ?
and reporters do nothing about it .
they' re too afraid to be side lined .
you' re paranoid , moll .
reporters rub shoulders with mps .
it' s like a referee dining with brazil just before a world cup final .
and what do you suggest we do ?
there' s nothing we can do .
you just spent 2 hours telling me ...
if i were you , i' d go home .
lick my wounds , and take charge of my life .
at least you have a family , and i' m sure they love you dearly .
hi , peter .
it' s official .
you' re now chairman .
congratulations .
have you been drinking ?
yes .
a little .
we have guests .
hi ...
i heard what happened .
what a mess .
i think you can get your job back .
what do you mean ?
i talked to erik .
you only have to apologise .
then he' il ask vestgaard to take you back .
you' ve talked to erik dreier ?
dreier is no crook .
this isn' t one of your cartoons .
all he did was leak a story that would have come out anyway .
it was in everybody' s interest .
what are you talking about ?
lone kjeldsen as prime minister .
do you realise the implications of that ?
i can' t support a woman , whose reforms would have cost me millions ?
it' s ridiculous .
you knew dreier planted the story ?
don' t ...
a story that killed a sick man !
don' t blame me for your lack of analytical powers .
please leave .
you' re behaving like a 12 year old .
i mean it !
get out !
gunnar !
why don' t you come back tomorrow ?
mind your own business , mette .
don' t speak to her like that !
she' s not mom waiting on your fancy friends .
was grandpa here ?
honey , it' s past your bedtime .
you should have told me ...
say goodnight .
night , daddy .
i want to get dreier .
he' il kill you .
you' il end up writing about killer anacondas .
i' il take my chances .
we' il never make it .
once he' s premier , it' il be too late .
why ?
if the story' s air tight ...
this type of story depends on the judgment of the people .
the chancellor was elected despite that big farming scandal ?
nope .
once he' s in , the voters will have no say .
listen !
aksel was dead for 4 days .
time enough to oust lone .
how does dreier fit in ?
simon had to fly home , you know .
why did it take him 4 days to get home ?
very convenient , no ?
hello ...
is simon in ?
hello .
sorry to bother you .
torp and moll , reporters .
you must be kidding !
don' t talk to them .
take it easy , pernille .
moll and torp .
sounds like a second rate rock band .
we have some questions concerning your flight home .
you intended to be home on monday 11th , the day after the accident ?
yes , and i had my ticket and all , but suddenly the plane was full .
did you book for the 14th yourself ?
no , parliament took care of it .
and you couldn' t fly earlier ?
it must be easy from buenos aires .
everything was booked solid .
i spent 3 days in a hotel , waiting .
it must have been tough .
because of my dad , you mean ?
we weren' t too close , he and i.
oh , you won' t write that , will you ?
of course not .
simon ?
will that be all ?
simon , which airline did you fly on the 14th ?
sas .
via stockholm .
nice guy .
if dreier did that to him !
leaving him in buenos aires , while his dad' s in intensive care .
we only have to prove that dreier cancelled the flight on the 11th .
aksel bruun !
it says here that you will cut student grants
and slash unemployment benefits .
is that true ?
look at that .
we used to call that " aksel bruun' s evil stare " .
that stare lost him the last election .
get used to smiling at criticism .
if you sound tolerant , the accusations will sound hollow .
no matter whether your opponent is right or wrong .
let' s focus on tomorrow .
i' m the only one on bo' s show .
bo loves using specific cases .
why can' t you help an old lady evicted from her home , for example .
it makes good television .
both you and bo know it' s not your department .
but don' t say that on the air .
the jerk treats me like a child !
torp has joined up with moll .
they' re looking into simon' s tickets .
what have they got ?
that' s what we have to find out .
simon bruun .
from buenos aires to stockholm on the 11th .
the centre party .
yes .
we didn' t cancel it ?
but he was not on the plane .
was he booked for the 14th on the same destination ?
okay , thanks ...
sas didn' t fly from buenos aires on the 14th .
simon was lying .
what about the 11th ?
they don' t give out information about passenger lists .
hello .
we' re from the tv show " they never came home " .
ulrik torp .
kjeld .
we' re on the trail of jesper jensen , who vanished 3 years ago .
without a single word to his wife and four kids .
we' ve heard that jesper arrived from stockholm on the 11th at 23 : 47 .
23 : 30 until 00 : 30 .
on screen 3 .
hey !
stop the tape .
rewind , please .
that' s him .
he' s been in the country the whole time .
my god , has he got four kids ?
what was his girlfriend' s name ?
birgitte ...
no , pernille .
could you print that out ?
simon !
hello !
simon !
they are not in .
okay , we know that pernille picked simon up at the airport .
they leave .
they go to dreier' s place .
to dreier' s place ?
no way .
why not ?
somebody could have seen simon .
dreier must go to the airport himself .
he asks simon to lay low for a while , until lone has been dealt with .
simon doesn' t care for his dad he' d just say " fuck that ! " no ...
there' s nothing in it for him .
simon is 22 .
what do you want more than anything else at 22 ?
i don' t know .
pussy ?
he already has that .
i' m tired of brain storming .
it' s brand new !
275 kilometres on the clock .
so we base the story on simon confessing the whole thing ?
it' s been a while .
yes .
thanks .
thanks , dear .
so what can i do for you ?
your son has joined forces with henrik moll .
and what can i do about that ?
i need to know what he' s up to .
he' s chasing his own tail .
there' s no case
he' s just a bitter journalist on a personal vendetta .
you thought you could wrap gunnar torp' s son around your finger .
you got him the job in parliament through vestgaard , right ?
if things got sticky , you figured ulrik would be loyal to his old dad .
so you won' t do me this favour ?
what do you want me to do ?
stab my own son in the back ?
i have an idea .
it calls for some courage under fire .
daddy , the police is here .
then you' il have to wake him up .
but what' s it all about ?
charges of harassment .
ulrik torp ?
yes , what is it ?
come with me , please .
simon bruun and erik dreier have asked for a restriction order on you
pursuant to article 265 of the penal code .
is this some kind of joke ?
no .
don' t contact these persons .
if you run into them , you must leave immediately .
if that' s impossible , you must refrain from any interaction .
making contact can lead to a fine or imprisonment .
if you come to the station with us , we' il get your statement right away .
take your own car , if you like .
i' il just get my jacket .
the express is running an interview with dreier tomorrow .
dreier says they knew that simon was here from monday .
that he disappeared in the airport and stayed away for 3 days .
he' s running a counter story .
we haven' t got shit on dreier .
what are you saying ?
we should stop while we' re ahead .
you think we' re ahead ?
what if we got dreier to lie ?
he' il be on tv tonight , right ?
yes .
on bo andersen' s " face to face " .
what if he lies and we can prove it ?
how ?
have you got proof hidden somewhere maybe ?
we' ve been handed restraining orders on everyone involved in this case .
the fall of man , the old testament and a new version ...
yes !
could i have a word with pernille ?
i have an important message from simon .
that' s absurd .
i can' t .
why not ?
it' s just not done .
dreier and i already agreed on what issues we' d broach .
his press manager calls me all the time for details .
any idea how much shit i' il get from upstairs if i attack him on the air ?
why should you obey rules set by politicians ' spin doctors ?
why should we bow to those in power ?
listen !
every single party in the cabinet has already complained
demanding changes in the management here ...
i don' t want to find myself out of a job !
bo , you' re the only one , who isn' t totally corrupt .
are you going to sell out now ?
moll , you sound like my grandma .
she keeps asking me , " when will you topple the government ?
imagine if you succeed ?
your show would make history , man !
we' il be talking about it in 10 years .
i' m sorry .
you need better proof .
it' s not me .
you don' t have to get involved .
i just need to know when and how dreier contacted simon .
i didn' t see simon till friday , when we parted with his dad .
look ...
listen !
it' s not me !
anyway , do you think i would tell you , if it was ?
yes ?
ulrik torp speaking .
ulrik ?
what do you want ?
listen , i feel bad about what happened .
i' m willing to do what it takes to get my job back .
that' s your business ...
i know .
but i got moll into it , and he has no scruples at all .
he' s made up some sick story for the express .
i' m really sorry .
what story ?
they' il print anything , you know .
but what is the story ?
meet me at the thimble bar in 30 .
deal .
see you there .
bye .
wait here .
i' il find bo for you .
thank you .
welcome .
thank you .
christina ... ?
is it okay to send you down to make up now ?
of course ...
hello .
hi .
what do you want ?
erik isn' t in .
you' re the one , we' re looking for .
will you sit down for a minute , please ?
what' s this all about ?
we know dreier kept simon away to postpone bruun' s death .
what are you talking about ?
you took simon to dreier' s place .
look at this picture .
it was taken at the airport on the 11th .
you lied to the press .
you misled the hospital staff .
you can' t stop the story being written .
question is , will your name be in it ?
what' s this ?
simon' s hotel bill .
he hid downtown .
and that' s a transfer of a quarter of a million to his account .
let' s take it from the top , shall we ?
so tuesday is the big day , right ?
erik dreier to studio 2 , please .
leave that with me .
cell phones disturb the broadcast sometimes .
i' il take good care of it .
i' m sure you will .
i took him to the hotel , where erik was waiting .
when did you agree to pick him up ?
in the morning , after he' d seen gitte in the hospital .
what the hell was he thinking ?
he just wants to be prime minister .
peter schou ?
i have a message from ulrik torp .
he said to say this one was on him .
hey !
you' re not allowed in here .
we have something for bo andersen .
you' il have to wait till he gets out .
it' s very important .
it' s for you .
from your grandma .
from my grandma ?
yes .
with the cord and everything ?
thanks a lot .
right ...
where' s signe .
she went home .
she seemed upset .
right , we' re ready !
3 ... 2 ... 1 ...
and mix !
erik dreier jensen , welcome .
it' s been a hectic week for you .
that' s true .
but it' s all going to end happily .
i wouldn' t use that word .
we lost aksel , and a wound like that takes time to heal .
and lone kjeldsen ?
she has my sympathies .
beyond that , i won' t discuss her private life on tv .
the latest polls are positive .
are they ?
that sounds good .
but let' s wait till tuesday .
will he use it ?
first he has to make dreier admit he didn' t know about simon .
he has to .
to make it effective .
ulrik , relax !
there' s nothing more you can do now .
jesus , did you see that ?
he just got up and left !
i' il talk to the producer .
and who might that be ?
you can' t broadcast this .
it was a live transmission .
this will be forgotten in two weeks .
i hope you realise that .
two weeks is more than enough .
well , ulrik ...
i' m going home now .
i need my beauty sleep .
satisfied ?
yes .
i am .
see you around .
