having reached the end of my sinner' s life ... my hair now white ...
i prepare to leave on this parchment my testimony ... as to the wondrous and terrible events ...
i witnessed in my youth ... at the end of the year of 1327 .
may god grant me the wisdom and grace ... to be the faithful chronicler of the happenings that tookplace ... in a remote abbey in the dark north of ltaly .
an abbey whose name it may seem , even now ... bias andprudent to omit .
the name of the rose
may my hand not tremble now that i start ... to relieve the past and revive the feelings of uneasiness ... that opressed my heart as we entered the battlements .
should we tell him ?
no .
he will look in the wrong places .
but ... what if he learns it of his own account ?
you' re overestimating his talents .
there' s only one authority capable of investigating such matters .
the holly lnquisition .
what' s your opinion , venerable jorge ?
dear brothers ...
i leave such worldly matters to younger men .
adso ?
yes , master .
to command nature ... one must learn to obey it , huh ?
so , return to the court , turn the building on your left ... enter the court on you right .
you' il find the place you' re in need of ... behind the third arch .
but you told me you' d never been to this abbey .
when we arrived , i saw a brother making this way so hazily .
but he left more slowly , with an air of content .
thank you , master .
on behalf of the benedict order ..
i' m honored to welcome you and your franciscan brothers ... to our abbey .
the other delegates have arrived ?
ubertino de casale has been here for some weeks ... the others are due tomorrow .
you must be very tired after your long journey .
not particularly .
you' re not in need of anything ?
no , thank you .
well ... then i ...
i beech you peace .
i' m sorry to see that one of your brothers ... has recently gone to god .
yes , a terrible loss .
brother adelmo was one of our finest illuminates .
not , adelmo of otranto ?
you knew him ?
no , but i knew and admired his work .
his humor and comic images were almost infamous .
but he was said to be very young .
ah , yes !
very young indeed .
an accident , no doubt .
yes , as you say , an accident .
well ... that is i ...
brother william ... may i speak to you candidly ?
you seem anxious to do so .
when i heard you were coming to our abbey ...
i thought it was an answer to my prayers .
he' s a man who has the knowledge both of the human spirit ... and of the wilds of the evil one .
brother adelmo' s death has caused much ... spiritual uneasy upon my flock .
this is my novice , adso .
the youngest son of the baron de melk .
please , do continue .
we found the body after a heavy storm ... horribly mutilated ... cast against a rock in front of the tower ... under a window that was ...
how should i say this ? which was ...
which was found closed .
somebody told you ?
lf it was opened ...
you' d not have mentioned spiritual uneasy .
he' d have fallen .
brother william ... the window can' t be opened ... nor was the glass shattered .
there' s no access through the roof above .
i see .
as you can' t find a natural explanation ... the monks suspect the presence of supernatural forces .
i need the help of an acute man such as you .
acute in uncovering and prudent , if necessary ... in covering up before the papal delegates arrive .
you know i no longer deal in such matters .
i' m reluctant to burden you with my dilemma , but ... unless i can tranquilize my flock ...
i have no alternative but turn to the lnquisition .
that is ubertino de casale ... one of the greatest spiritual leaders of our order .
come .
many revere him as a living saint ... but others would have him burnt as a heretic .
his book on the poverty of the clergy ... isn' t favorite reading in the papal palace .
so , now he lives in hiding .
dear franciscans ... you must leave this place at once .
the devil' s roaming this abbey !
ubertino , it' s , william .
willian of baskerville .
william is dead .
william ... my son ... forgive me .
we lost trace ofyou for so long !
i tried hard to be forgotten .
when we heard of your troubles ...
i prayed to our virgin for a miracle .
your prayers met with a favorable response .
this is my young novice , adso de melk .
his father has entrusted me his education and wealth .
let him out of here at once !
haven' t you heard the devil ... is hurling beautiful boys out of windows ?
there was something feminine ... something diabolical ... about the young one who died .
he had the eyes of a girl ... seeking into course with the devil .
beware of this place .
the beast is still among us .
i can sense him ... now ... here ... within these very walls .
i' m afraid , william .
for you , for me .
for the outcome of this debate ...
my son !
the times we' re living !
let' s not frighten our young friend .
she' s beautiful , isn' t she ?
when a female ... by nature so perverted ... becomes sublime by holiness ... then she can be the noble vehicle of grace .
beautiful are the breasts ... which feed only one baby .
i don' t like this place .
really ?
i find it thrillingly .
come .
we must not allow ourselves to be influenced ... by irrational rumors of the antichrist .
let' s instead exercise our brains ... and try to solve this enigma .
may you receive more in heaven ... for what you' ve given in earth .
my master trusted aristotle , the greek philosopher ... and in his remarkable logic intelligence .
unhappily , my fears were not ... mere phantoms of my youthful imagination .
a rather dark end for such a brilliant illuminate .
another generous donation by the church to the poor .
what if it wasn' t that tower he fell from ... but somewhere over there and the body rolled all the way down here ?
no devil needed anymore .
there' s more blood here .
that' s where he fell from .
he jumped .
are you paying attention ?
yes , he jumped .
jumped ?
you mean that he committed suicide ?
why else would someone go up there in the middle of a rainstorm ?
not to admire the landscape .
perhaps someone murdered him .
and then towed all the way up there with the body ?
much easier to get rid of it through that small door .
my dear adso .
it seems elementary .
suicide ?
do you think this is a place abandoned by god ?
have you ever known a place where god would' ve felt at home ?
we pray , oh , mighty god , that there are no grounds ... for suspecting the presence of an evil spirit among us ... either of this world or another .
we praise our lord that the debate ... we are so greatly honored to host ... may now proceed without a shadow of fear .
we also praise oh mighty for sending us brother william ... whose experience and previous duties ... although onerous to him ... has been of such service to us here .
may serenity and spiritual peace ... reign once more in our hearts .
a monk must be quiet .
he mustn' t speak what he' s thinking ... until he' s asked .
a monk mustn' t laugh .
that' s what fools are for ... who raise their voices in laughter .
master , if i may ask what ... onerous duties was the abbot talking about ?
were you not always a monk ?
even monks have past , adso .
now , try to sleep .
just ...
yes , master .
there' s sadness in wisdom .
the one who increases his knowledge ... also increases his suffering .
a calamity !
it was a calamity !
father !
a tragedy in the pigpen !
come !
come quickly !
this one , i admit , didn' t commit suicide .
water !
venancius , the greek translator !
i' m to blame .
had i not been so eager to believe your convenient explanation ... this second tragedy might' ve been prevented .
i' m convinced brother adelmo took his own life .
whether this death is connected with it .
i intend to find .
after the heavy storm , with the second trumpet ... " " the sea became blood .
and hold ... there' s blood here !
the prophecy of the apocalypse .
with the third trumpet , a burning star ... " " will fall in fountains of water '
the devil is here !
grated stem bistort for treating diarrhea .
as for onions , administered in small quantities ... warm and moist , they help to prolong the male erection .
in those who haven' t taken our vows , naturally .
do you apply arsenic in many circumstances ?
yes , indeed .
this effective remedy for nervous disorders .
if taken in small doses .
and what if not in so small doses ?
death .
what was his function here ?
he was our finest translator of greek .
entirely devoted to the works of aristotle .
was he in friendly terms with the handsome adelmo ?
yes .
they worked together in the escritoire .
but in a brotherly way understand ?
not like ...
i mean ... flesh can be tempted according to nature ... or against nature .
and they weren' t allowed to this position ... you see !
penitengiazite !
watch out for satan , who comes to know your soul .
death is supreme .
contemplating my sanctuary ?
there , we have the devil .
as ugly as salvatore .
my little brother , penitenziagite .
penitenziagite " ?
i didn' t say that .
you said " penitenziagite " .
i heard .
noble father , " magnifico " !
i don' t have a good rhetoric .
i said " penitence " .
i' m a monk .
saint benedict !
saint benedict !
salvatore , come here .
master , what language was he speaking ?
all languages and none .
and what was the word you both repeated ?
penitenziagite " ?
what does it mean ?
that the hunchback , undoubtedly ... was once a herectic .
penitenziagite " was the rally cry of dolcinites .
dolcinites ?
who were they ?
those who believed in the poverty of christ .
so do we , franciscans .
but they also declared everyone must be poor .
so , they slaughtered the rich .
you see , adso ... the step between ecstatic vision and sinful frenzy ... is all too brief .
so , could he not have killed the translator ?
no .
fat bishops and wealthy priests ... were more to the taste ofthe dolcinites ... not a specialist of aristotle .
but you' re right , we must keep the mind open .
we' re fortunate to have such a snowy ground here .
it' s the parchment on which the criminal , unwillingly ... writes his autograph .
what do you mean from these footprints here ?
they' re twice as deep as the others , master .
good !
and thus we may conclude ...
that the man was very heavy .
precisely !
and why was he very heavy ?
because ... he was very fat ?
or because he was carrying another man .
let' s commit the autograph of this sole to our memory .
but the footprints lead away from the jar , in this direction .
adso , you' re discounting the possibility ... that the man was walking backwards , dragging the body ... into the furrows created by the heels .
where did the erudite greek translator ... meet the anonymous author of his death ?
brother librarian ... perhaps you' d permit us to examine the work of the two unfortunates ... who were so distressingly gone to god .
your request' s most unusual .
as are the circumstances of their deaths .
brother adelmo sat there .
eyeglasses in frames .
a donkey teaching the scriptures to the bishops .
the pope as a fox .
and the abbot as a monkey .
he had a daring talent for comic images .
a monk must not laugh !
only fools laugh for nothing !
i trust my words didn' t offend you brother william ... but i heard them laughing at unlaughable things .
you , franciscans , however , belong to an order ... where merriment is viewed with indulges .
yes , it' s true .
saint francis was much disposed to laughter .
laughter' s a devil' s squint which deforms the face ... and makes men look like monkeys .
monkeys do not laugh .
laughter' s particular to man .
as a sin .
christ never laughed .
can you be so sure ?
there' s nothing in the scriptures to say that he did .
there' s nothing there to say he didn' t .
even the saints also employed comedy ... to ridicule the enemies ofthe faith .
for example , when the pagans plunged saint maurus ... into the boiling water , he complained ... that his bath was cold .
the sultan put his hand in ...
and burnt himself .
a saint ... immersed in boiling water doesn' t play childish tricks .
he restrains his cries and suffers for the truth .
and yet , aristotle devoted his second book of poetics to comedy ... as an instrument of truth .
have you read this work ?
of course not .
it' s been lost for centuries .
no , it' s not !
it was never written !
because providence doesn' t want futile things glorified .
that i must contempt .
enough !
this abbey is overshadowed by grief .
yet you would ... intrude on our sorrows with idle banter !
forgive me , venerable jorge .
my remarks were truly out of place .
which was the greek translator' s desk ?
this one .
come , adso .
what' d you deduce from that visit ?
that we' re not meant to laugh in there .
but you noticed how few books there were on the escritoire' s shelves ?
all those scriveners , copyists , translators , researchers ... thinkers ...
where are the books needed for their work ... and for which this abbey is famous ?
where are the books ?
are you testing me ?
what do you mean ?
with all due respect ... it seems that whenever you ask me a question , you already have the answer .
do you know where the books are ?
no , but i' ve faith that that tower contains something other than air .
did you see the little door the librarian closed as we came in ?
that leads to the library ?
master !
quick !
i have him !
stop !
enough .
he tried to kill us .
salvatore !
please , don' t talk to the abbot about his past .
he' s innocent ofthe deaths in this abbey .
i swear it .
brother remigio , my price is some information .
i couldn' t comprehend why my master so quickly dismissed ... my suspicions for the heretic hunchback ... and why it was so urgent that we visited the tower .
i assumed he couldn' t resist the temptation ... to penetrate the library and look at the books .
no lock .
just as i thought , it must be bolted from inside .
how do we get in ?
obviously , there must be another entrance .
let' s see what the moon faced assistant librarian ... was trying to conceal this morning .
tiny greek letters .
perhaps written by an ant with ink feet .
have fun with the defects of vulgar people .
written with lemon juice .
sagittarius ...
sun ...
mercury ...
scorpion .
it' s a zodiac code ... giving directions ... but to where ?
who' s there ?
who' s there ?
my magnifying glasses ...
they were in that book .
you go that way .
come on out , you little bitch !
i know you' re here .
i can smell you .
what' s the matter with you ?
are you afraid of me ?
i' il find you .
who was she ?
who was this creature that rose like the dawn ... bewitched as the moon , radiant as the sun .. terrible as an army poised for battle ?
good evening , salvatore .
this is where you catch them ?
here they' re " piu grassi " , bigger .
do you eat them ?
do you like ?
thank you , no .
lch bin " good catholic .
as you' re a good christian , you must tell me .
so adelmo gave the parchment to berengar ?
no .
to the trans ... tran ...
translator !
venancius , the black monk .
what happened then ?
master !
here , quick !
i found another one .
where are your wits , boy ?
have you ever met anyone with a rib cage large enough to accommodate ... a heart ofthose dimensions ?
this is the heart of an ox .
one ofthe monks probably gave it to that peasant girl ... in exchange for her favors .
a girl ?
what ?
the one i saw out of here .
he must' ve been a very ugly monk .
why ugly ?
if he' d been young and beautiful , she' d have blessed him ... with her carnal favors for nothing .
whatever happened in this dreadful kitchen ... has no bearing on our investigations .
the hunchback' s convinced me that brother berengar ... the assistant librarian , is the key to the whole enigma .
what did you say ?
nothing , master .
good .
master ?
there' s something i must tell you .
i know .
then , you' il hear my confession ?
i' d rather you told me first as a friend .
master ...
have you ever been ... in love ?
in love ?
many times .
you were ?
of course .
aristotle , ovid , virgil ...
no .
i meant with a ...
are you not confusing love with lust ?
am l ?
i don' t know .
i want to make her own good .
i want her to be happy .
i want to save her from poverty .
oh , dear !
why " oh , dear " ?
you are in love .
is that bad ?
for a monk it presents certain problems .
but doesn' t st thomas aquinas praise love above all the virtues ?
yes , the love of god , adso .
love of god !
and the love of ... woman ?
of woman , thomas aquinas knew very little .
the scriptures are very clear .
proverbs warns us .
woman takes possession of a man' s precious soul .
more bitter than death is woman .
yes , but what do you think , master ?
of course , i don' t have the benefit of your experience ... but i find it difficult to convince myself that ...
god' d have introduced such a being into creation ... without endowing her with some virtues .
how peaceful life' d be without love , adso .
how safe ... how tranquil ... and how dull .
god , you' ve guided us to this refuge ... of spiritual peace because you wish for reconciliation ... as much as we , franciscans .
let' s go , brothers !
brother berengar ?
he' s probably hiding somewhere ... with the book and my magnifying glasses .
brother berengar ?
master , look !
the door !
brother malaquias !
i was looking for brother berengar .
is he here ?
no .
i see .
do you know where we might find him ?
no .
or is he perhaps upstairs , in the library ?
no .
i' m curious to see the library for myself .
may i do so ?
no .
why not ?
it' s strict order of the abbot .
no one' s permitted to enter the library ... other than myself and my assistant .
i see .
thank you again .
maybe something' s happened to him .
maybe we' il find him in the water .
what ?
the third trumpet ... as ubertino said .
the book of revelation .
that' s not the book we' re after .
is it a chicken for you ?
it' s more like a sparrow .
franciscans .
welcome to our abbey , brother michele .
and your fellow franciscan delegates .
get in the line like the others !
salvatore , let him go !
this is cuthbert of winchester ... one of our most esteemed franciscan guests .
come , your grace .
we have a very urgent matter to discuss .
the abbot and his colleagues believe ... the devil' s at work within these walls .
he is !
the only evidence i see ofthe devil ... is everyone' s desire to see him at work .
what if ubertino' s right and you' re wrong ?
this debate' s crucial to us all . we suspect the pope wants to crash our order .
and declare us heretics .
yes , and declare us heretics .
i only have one brother to question and the matter' s resolved .
william , we place our trust in you .
i pray god that you don' t abuse it .
brother william .
did you find a book in greek ?
i was right .
so was the book of revelation .
we must talk at once .
lndeed , we must .
and i have much to tell .
just as he and i' ve examined this corpse .
lime leaves in the bath are used to alleviate pain .
he was left handed ?
brother berengar was inverted in many ways .
are there other left handed brothers at the abbey ?
not that i know .
ink stains .
he didn' t write with his tongue , i presume .
a few lines in greek .
yes , written by venancius .
notes from the book he was reading ... just before he died .
you see how the calligraphy changes ?
from this point on , he was dying .
and what can we conclude from that ?
a spot of blue paint . yes , but a unique spot of blue ... blended by your finest illuminate , brother adelmo ... who had this parchment before venancius .
how do we know that ?
because those notes overrun ...
adelmo' s blue spots , and not vice versa .
brother william ... this abbey is enshrouded in a terrifying mystery .
yet , i detect nothing , in your obscure citation ... that sheds light upon it .
adso , the light .
someone was in great pains to conceal a secret ... ofthe first magnitude .
the calligraphy' s , without question , left handed .
the only left handed member ofyour community is ... or rather was ... brother berengar , the assistant librarian .
what kind of secret knowledge would he not have privilege ?
i feel you' re about to tell me .
books .
restricted books .
spiritually dangerous books .
everyone here knew of the assistant' s passion ... forhandsome boys .
when the beautiful adelmo ... wanted to readsuch a forbidden book ...
berengar offered him the key to its whereabouts ... inside that parchment ... in exchange for unnatural caresses .
enough , william !
adelmo submitted to berengar' s lustful advances .
but afterwards wracked , byremorse he wandered desperate ... in the graveyard , where he met the greek translator .
how do you know ?
there was a witness .
the hunchback ... he sawadelmo giving this parchment to venancius ... and running towards the small tower ... and hurling himself out of the window . the night of my arrival , while berengarpunished his sinful flesh ...
venancius , following the instructions on the parchment ... entered the forbidden library and found the book .
he took it back to his desk and began to read it .
afterscribbling down those mysterious quotations ... he died with a blackstain on his finger .
the assistant discovered the body ... and dragged it down to the pigpen to avertsuspicion on him .
but he left his autograph behind .
the book remained on the translator' s desk .
berengar returned there last night and read it .
soon after , overcome bysome agonizing pain ... he tried to take a soothing bath with lime leaves ... and drawned .
he too had a black finger .
all three died because ofa book which kills ... or for which men will kill .
therefore , i urge you to grant me access to the library .
brother william , your pride blinds you .
by idolizing reason ... you failed to see what' s obvious to everyone in this abbey .
the papal delegation' s arrived .
bernardo gui .
thank you , brother william .
we' re grateful for your efforts ... but i now ask you ... to refrain from further investigations .
happily , there' il be someone arriving with the papal delegation ... who is a well versed in the wilds ofthe evil one .
a man , i believe , you know too well .
bernardo gui ... ofthe lnquisition .
master , who' s bernardo gui ?
i' ve been searching the entire abbey for you !
michele wishes to speak with you at once .
alone .
you know who' s coming ?
i know .
bernardo gui .
ubertino must be moved to a safe place .
the arrangements have been made .
it' s you that concerns us .
you must put aside these totally irrelevant investigations .
erroneous conclusions .
it' s the truth .
i' m right .
william' s right , he' s always right !
no matter what the consequences ... for himself or anyone else ...
william of baskerville ... must always prove himself right .
wasn' t your vanity , your intellectual pride ... that brought you into conflict with bernardo gui before ?
do not dare fate twice , william .
not even the emperor will be able to save you if you tangle with bernardo .
my flesh' d forgotten the sinfulpleasure she' d ... given me .
but mysoul couldn' t forget her .
and now ?
now that lsaw herin the midst ofherpovertyandsquatter ...
ipraised god that i was a franciscan .
i wanted her to know that i didn' t belong to ... this abbeybut to an orderdedicated to lifting ... herpeople out of theirphysical destitution # .
andspiritual depravation .
farewell william .
you' re mad and arrogant .
but i love you and i' il never cease to pray for you .
goodbye , dear child .
try not to learn too many bad examples from your master .
he thinks too much .
relying always on the ... deductions of his head .
instead oftrusting in the prophetic capacities ... of his heart .
learn to mortify your ... intelligence .
weep over the wounds of our lord ... and do throw away those books !
there' s a side of ubertino i truly envy .
remember , fear the last trumpet , my friends .
the next' il fall from the sky .
and then will come a thousand ...
scorpions .
yes , we won' t forget .
which one frightens you most ?
they all do .
look closely .
that one .
my choice exactly .
after you .
those are the foundations ofthe tower .
but how to reach the library ?
the rats love parchment even more than scholars do .
let' s follow him .
