i have a very firm grip .
i think it' s time you went to bed .

whereabouts are you headed ?
the leaky cauldron .
that' s in london .
you hear that ?
the leaky cauldron .
that' s in london .
the leaky cauldron .
if you have pea soup ... ... make sure you eat it before it eats you .
but the muggles .
can' t they see us ?
muggles ?
they don' t see nothing , do they ?
no , but if you jab them with a fork , they feel .
ernie , little old lady at 12 o' clock !
ten , nine , eight ... ... seven , six , five ... ... four , three , three and a half ... ... two , one and three quarters .
yes !
who is that ?
that man .
who is that ?
who is ... ?
that is sirius black , that is .
don' t tell me you' ve never been hearing of sirius black .
he' s a murderer .
got himself locked up in azkaban for it .
how did he escape ?
well , that' s the question , isn' t it ?
he' s the first one that done it .
he was a big supporter of ... ... you know who .
i reckon you' ve heard of him .
yeah .
him i' ve heard of .
ernie , two double deckers at 12 o' clock .
they' re getting closer , ernie .
ernie , they' re right on top of us !
mind your head .
hey , guys ?
guys ?
why the long faces ?
yeah , yeah .
nearly there .
nearly there .
the leaky cauldron .
next stop , knockturn alley .
mr. potter , at last .
take it away , ern .
yeah , take it away , ernie !
room 11 .
hedwig .
right smart bird you got there , mr. potter .
he arrived here just five minutes before yourself .
as minister for magic , it is my duty to inform you , mr. potter ... ... earlier this evening your uncle' s sister was located ... ... a little south of sheffield , circling a chimney stack .
the accidental magic reversal department was dispatched immediately .
she has been properly punctured and her memory modified .
she will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever .
so that' s that ... ... and no harm done .
pea soup ?
no , thank you .
minister ?
yes ?
i don' t understand .
understand ?
i broke the law .
underage wizards can' t use magic at home .
come now .
the ministry doesn' t send people to azkaban ... ... for blowing up their aunts .
on the other hand , running away like that , given the state of things ... ... was very , very irresponsible .
" the state of things , " sir ?
we have a killer on the loose .
sirius black , you mean ?
but what' s he got to do with me ?
nothing , of course .
you' re safe .
and that' s what matters .
and tomorrow you' il be on your way back to hogwarts .
these are your new schoolbooks .
i took the liberty ... ... of having them brought here .
now tom will show you to your room .
hedwig .
oh , by the way , harry .
whilst you' re here , it would be best if you didn' t ... ... wander .
right !
you gonna move that bus or what ?
housekeeping .
i' il come back later .
i' m warning you , hermione .
keep that beast away from scabbers , or i' il turn it into a tea cozy .
it' s a cat , ronald .
what do you expect ?
it' s in his nature .
a cat ?
is that what they told you ?
looks like a pig with hair .
that' s rich ... ... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush .
crookshanks , just ignore the mean little boy .
harry .
harry .
egypt .
what' s it like ?
brilliant .
loads of old stuff ... ... like mummies , tombs , even scabbers enjoyed himself .
egyptians used to worship cats .
along with the dung beetle .
not flashing that clipping again ?
i haven' t shown anyone .
no , not a soul .
not unless you count tom .
the day maid .
night maid .
cook .
the bloke who fixed the toilet .
harry .
mrs. weasley .
good to see you , dear .
good to see you .
got everything ?
yes .
yes ?
all your books ?
it' s all upstairs .
your clothes ?
everything .
good boy .
thank you .
harry potter .
mr. weasley .
harry , wonder if i might have a word ?
yeah , sure .
hermione .
good morning , mr. weasley .
looking forward to a new term ?
yeah .
it should be great .
harry , some within the ministry would strongly discourage me ... ... from divulging what i' m about to reveal to you .
but i think that you need to know the facts .
you are in danger .
grave danger .
has this anything to do with sirius black , sir ?
what do you know about sirius black , harry ?
only that he' s escaped from azkaban .
do you know why ?
thirteen years ago , when you stopped ...
voldemort .
don' t say his name .
sorry .
when you stopped you know who ... ... black lost everything .
but to this day , he still remains a faithful servant .
and in his mind ... ... you are the only thing that stands in the way ... ... of you know who returning to power .
and that is why ... ... he has escaped from azkaban .
to find you .
and kill me .
harry , swear to me that whatever you might hear ... ... you won' t go looking for black .
mr. weasley ... ... why would i go looking for someone who wants to kill me ?
quick .
quick .
ron , ron !
oh , for goodness ' sake !
don' t lose him !
i didn' t mean to blow her up .
i just ...
i lost control .
brilliant .
honestly , ron , it' s not funny .
harry was lucky not to be expelled .
i was lucky not to be arrested .
i still think it was brilliant .
come on .
everywhere else is full .
who do you think that is ?
professor r. j. lupin .
do you know everything ?
how is it she knows everything ?
it' s on his suitcase , ronald .
oh .
do you think he' s really asleep ?
seems to be .
why ?
i gotta tell you something .
let me get this straight .
sirius black escaped from azkaban ... ... to come after you ?
yeah .
but they' il catch black , won' t they ?
i mean , everyone' s looking for him .
sure .
except no one' s ever broken out of azkaban before ... ... and he' s a murderous , raving lunatic .
thanks , ron .
why are we stopping ?
we can' t be there yet .
what' s going on ?
i don' t know .
maybe we' ve broken down .
ouch , ron .
that was my foot .
there' s something moving out there .
i think someone' s coming aboard .
bloody hell !
what' s happening ?
harry .
harry , are you all right ?
thank you .
here , eat this .
it' il help .
it' s all right .
it' s chocolate .
what was that thing that came ?
it was a dementor .
one of the guards of azkaban .
it' s gone now .
it was searching the train for sirius black .
if you' il excuse me , i need to have a little word with the driver .
eat .
you' il feel better .
what happened to me ?
well , you sort of went rigid .
we thought maybe you were having a fit or something .
and did either of you two ... ... you know ... ... pass out ?
no .
i felt weird , though .
like i' d never be cheerful again .
but someone was screaming .
a woman .
no one was screaming , harry .
welcome !
welcome to another year at hogwarts .
now , i' d like to say a few words ... ... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast .
first , i' m pleased to welcome professor r. j. lupin ... ... who' s kindly consented to fill the post ... ... of defense against the dark arts teacher .
good luck , professor .
of course .
that' s why he knew to give you the chocolate , harry .
potter .
is it true you fainted ?
i mean , you actually fainted ?
shove off , malfoy .
how did he find out ?
just forget it .
our care of magical creatures teacher ... ... has decided to retire ... ... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs .
fortunately , i' m delighted to announce ... ... that his place will be taken by none other ... ... than our own rubeus hagrid .
finally , on a more disquieting note ... ... at the request of the ministry of magic ... ... hogwarts will , until further notice , play host to the dementors of azkaban ... ... until such a time as sirius black is captured .
the dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds .
now whilst i' ve been assured ... ... that their presence will not disrupt our day to day activities ... ... a word of caution .
dementors are vicious creatures .
they' il not distinguish ... ... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way .
therefore , i must warn each and every one of you ... ... to give them no reason to harm you .
it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving .
but you know , happiness can be found ... ... even in the darkest of times ... ... if one only remembers to turn on the light .
fortuna major .
here , listen .
she just won' t let me in .
fortuna major .
no , no .
wait , wait .
watch this .
amazing .
just with my voice .
fortuna major .
yes , all right .
go in .
thank you .
still doing that after three years .
she can' t even sing .
exactly .
hey , man .
hey , man .
oh , god .
that' s awful .
green .
that' s a monkey .
what is that ?
you call that a monkey ?
do not give him one again .
hey , neville , try an elephant .
ron , catch .
i will .
i think we have a winner .
oh , don' t try one of them .
oh , no .
look at him .
his face .
welcome , my children .
in this room , you shall explore the noble art of divination .
in this room , you shall discover if you possess the sight .
hello .
i am professor trelawney .
together we shall cast ourselves into the future .
this term , we' il focus on tasseomancy , the art of reading tea leaves .
so please , take the cup of the person sitting opposite you .
what do you see ?
the truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book , waiting to be read .
but first , you must broaden your minds .
first , you must look beyond .
what a load of rubbish .
where did you come from ?
me ?
i' ve been here all this time .
you , boy ...
is your grandmother quite well ?
i think so .
i wouldn' t be so sure of that .
give me the cup .
pity .
broaden your minds .
your aura is pulsing , dear .
are you in the beyond ?
i think you are .
sure .
look at the cup .
tell me what you see .
yeah .
harry' s got sort of a wonky cross .
that' s trials and suffering .
and that there could be the sun and that' s happiness .
so ... ... you' re gonna suffer , but you' re gonna be happy about it .
give me the cup .
oh , my dear boy .
my dear ... ... you have the grim .
the grin ?
what' s the grin ?
not the grin , you idiot .
the grim .
taking form of a giant spectral dog .
it' s among the darkest omens in our world .
it' s an omen ... ... of death .
you don' t think that grim thing' s got anything to do with sirius black ?
oh , honestly , ron .
if you ask me , divination' s a woolly discipline .
now , ancient runes , that' s a fascinating subject .
ancient runes ?
exactly how many classes are you taking ?
a fair few .
hang on .
that' s not possible .
ancient runes is in the same time as divination .
you have to be in two classes at once .
don' t be silly .
how could anyone be in two classes at once ?
broaden your minds .
use your inner eye to see the future .
that' s it .
come on , now .
come closer .
less talking , if you don' t mind .
i got a real treat for you today .
a great lesson .
so follow me .
right , you lot .
less chattering .
form a group over there .
and open your books to page 49 .
exactly how do we do that ?
just stroke the spine , of course .
goodness me .
don' t be such a wimp , longbottom .
i' m okay .
okay .
i think they' re funny .
oh , yeah .
terribly funny .
witty .
god , this place has gone to the dogs .
wait until father hears dumbledore' s got this oaf teaching classes .
shut up , malfoy .
dementor !
dementor !
just ignore him .
you' re supposed to stroke it .
yeah .
isn' t he beautiful ?
say hello to buckbeak .
hagrid , exactly what is that ?
that , ron , is a hippogriff .
first thing you wanna know is they' re very proud creatures .
very easily offended .
you do not want to insult a hippogriff .
it may be the last thing you ever do .
now , who' d like to come and say hello ?
well done , harry .
well done .
come on now .
now ... ... you have to let him make the first move .
it' s only polite .
so ... ... step up .
give him a nice bow .
then you wait and see if he bows back .
if he does , you can go and touch him .
if not ...
well , we' il get to that later .
just make your bow .
nice and low .
back off , harry .
back off .
keep still .
keep still .
well done , harry .
well done .
here , you big brute , you .
right .
i think you can go and pat him now .
go on .
don' t be shy .
nice and slow , now .
nice and slow .
slow .
not so fast , harry .
slow down , harry .
that' s it ...
nice and slow .
now let him come to you .
slowly , now , slowly , slowly ...
that' s it ...
yes !
well done !
well done , harry , well done !
does he get to fly ?
i think he may let you ride him now .
what ?
come on .
hey , hey , hey !
put you over here , just behind the wing joint .
don' t pull out any of his feathers , because he won' t thank you for that .
well done , harry , and well done , buckbeak .
that was wicked , harry !
oh , please .
well done , well done .
how am i doing me first day ?
brilliant , professor .
you' re not dangerous at all , are you , you great ugly brute !
malfoy , no ...
no !
buckbeak !
whoa , whoa , whoa ...
whoa !
buckbeak !
away , you silly creature ...
it' s killed me !
calm down .
it' s just a scratch !
hagrid !
he has to be taken to the hospital .
i' m the teacher .
i' il do it .
you' re gonna regret this .
class dismissed !
you and your bloody chicken !
does it hurt terribly , draco ?
it comes and it goes .
still , i consider myself lucky .
madam pomfrey said another minute and i could' ve lost my arm .
i can' t do homework for weeks .
listen to the idiot .
he' s really laying it on thick , isn' t he ?
at least hagrid didn' t get fired .
i hear draco' s father' s furious .
we haven' t heard the end of this .
he' s been sighted !
who ?
sirius black !
dufftown ?
that' s not far from here .
you don' t think he' d come to hogwarts , do you ?
with dementors at every entrance ?
dementors ?
he slipped past them once .
who' s to say he won' t do it again ?
that' s right .
black could be anywhere .
it' s like trying to catch smoke .
like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands .
intriguing , isn' t it ?
would anyone like to venture a guess ... ... as to what is inside ?
that' s a boggart , that is .
very good , mr. thomas .
now , can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like ?
no one knows .
when did she get here ?
boggarts are shape shifters .
they take the shape of whatever a person fears the most .
that' s what makes them so ...
so terrifying , yes , yes , yes ...
luckily , a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart .
let' s practice it now .
without wands , please .
after me .
riddikulus !
riddikulus !
very good .
a little louder and very clear .
riddikulus !
riddikulus !
this class is ridiculous .
very good .
so much for the easy part .
you see , the incantation alone is not enough .
what really finishes a boggart is laughter .
you need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing .
let me explain .
neville , would you join me , please ?
come on , don' t be shy .
come on .
come on .
hello .
neville , what frightens you most of all ?
professor snape .
sorry ?
professor snape .
professor snape .
yes , frightens all .
you live with your grandmother .
i don' t want it to turn into her , either .
no ... ... it won' t .
i want you to picture her clothes .
only her clothes , very clearly , in your mind .
she carries a red handbag ...
we don' t need to hear .
as long as you see it , we' il see it .
now , when i open that wardrobe ... ... here' s what i want you to do .
excuse me .
imagine professor snape in your grandmother' s clothes .
can you do that ?
yes .
wand at the ready .
one , two , three .
think , neville , think .
riddikulus !
wonderful , neville , wonderful !
incredible !
okay ... ... to the back , neville .
everyone , form a line ...
form a line !
i want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most ... ... and turn it into something funny .
next !
ron !
concentrate .
face your fear .
be brave !
wand at the ready , ron .
riddikulus !
yes !
you see ?
very good , very good !
marvelous !
absolutely , very , very enjoyable !
parvati !
next !
show us what you see .
keep your nerve .
steady .
riddikulus !
and next !
step up , step up !
wonderful , wonderful !
here !
riddikulus !
right .
sorry about that .
that' s enough for today .
collect your books from the back .
that' s the end of the lesson .
thank you !
sorry !
sorry , you can have too much of a good thing .
remember , these visits to hogsmeade village are a privilege .
should your behavior reflect poorly on the school ... ... that privilege shall not be extended again .
no permission form signed , no visiting the village .
that' s the rule , potter .
those with permission , follow me .
those without , stay put .
i thought if you signed it , then i could ...
i can' t .
only a parent or a guardian can sign .
since i am neither , it would be inappropriate .
i' m sorry , potter .
that' s my final word .
forget about it , guys .
see you later .
professor , can i ask you something ?
you want to know why i stopped you facing that boggart , yes ?
i thought it' d be obvious .
i assumed it would take the shape of lord voldemort .
i did think of voldemort at first .
but then i remembered that night on the train ... ... and the dementor .
i' m very impressed .
that suggests what you fear the most is fear itself .
this is very wise .
before i fainted ... ... i heard something .
a woman ... ... screaming .
dementors force us to relive our very worst memories .
our pain becomes their power .
i think it was my mother ... ... the night she was murdered .
the very first time i saw you , harry , i recognized you immediately .
not by your scar , by your eyes .
they' re your mother , lily' s .
yes .
oh , yes .
i knew her .
your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was .
not only was she a singularly gifted witch ... ... she was also an uncommonly kind woman .
she had a way of seeing the beauty in others ... ... even , and most especially , when that person could not see it in themselves .
and your father , james , on the other hand ... ... he ...
he had a certain , shall we say , talent for trouble .
a talent , rumor has it , he passed on to you .
you' re more like them than you know , harry .
in time , you' il come to see just how much .
honeyduke' s sweetshop is brilliant , but nothing beats zonko' s joke shop .
we never got to go to the shrieking shack .
you heard it' s the most ...
haunted building in britain .
i know .
what' s going on ?
probably neville forgot the password again .
hey .
oh , you' re there .
let me through , please .
excuse me !
i' m head boy !
get back , all of you .
no one is to enter this dormitory until it' s been searched .
the fat lady !
she' s gone !
serves her right .
she was a terrible singer .
it' s not funny , ron .
keep calm , everyone .
break into fours .
back to your common room .
be quiet .
make way .
the headmaster' s here .
come on , move .
you heard .
move !
mr. filch ?
round up the ghosts .
tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the fat lady .
there' s no need for ghosts , professor .
the fat lady' s there .
mind where you' re going !
slow down !
you listen !
i' m head boy !
come back here !
keep moving !
dear lady , who did this to you ?
eyes like the devil , he' s got , and a soul as dark as his name .
it' s him , headmaster .
the one they all talk about .
he' s here , somewhere in the castle !
sirius black !
secure the castle , mr. filch .
the rest of you , to the great hall .
i' ve searched the astronomy tower and the owlery .
there' s nothing there .
thank you .
the third floor' s clear too , sir .
very good .
i' ve done the dungeons .
no sign of black , nor anywhere else in the castle .
i didn' t really expect him to linger .
remarkable feat , don' t you think ?
to enter hogwarts castle on one' s own ... ... completely undetected ?
quite remarkable , yes .
any theories on how he managed it ?
many .
each as unlikely as the next .
you may recall ... ... prior to the start of term i expressed concerns ... ... about your appointment of professor ...
not a single professor inside this castle would help sirius black enter it .
i' m quite convinced the castle is safe ... ... and i' m more than willing to send the students to their houses .
what about potter ?
should he be warned ?
perhaps .
but for now , let him sleep .
for in dreams , we enter a world that' s entirely our own .
let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud .
turn to page 394 .
excuse me , sir .
where' s professor lupin ?
that' s not really your concern , is it , potter ?
suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching ... ... at the present time .
turn to page 394 .
werewolves " ?
sir , we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks .
we' re not meant to start that for weeks .
quiet .
when did she come in ?
did you see her come in ?
now , which one of you can tell me the difference ... ... between an animagus and a werewolf ?
no one ?
how disappointing .
please , sir .
an animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal .
a werewolf has no choice .
with each full moon ... ... he no longer remembers who he is .
he' d kill his best friend .
the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind .
thank you , mr. malfoy .
that' s the second time ... ... you' ve spoken out of turn , miss granger .
are you incapable of restraining yourself ... ... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know it all ?
he' s got a point , you know .
five points from gryffindor .
as an antidote to your ignorance , and on my desk , by monday morning ... ... two rolls of parchment on the werewolf , with emphasis ... ... on recognizing it .
it' s quidditch tomorrow .
then i suggest you take extra care , mr. potter .
loss of limb will not excuse you .
page 394 .
the term " werewolf " ... ... is a contraction of the anglo saxon word " wer " ... ... which means " man , " and " wolf .
werewolf , man wolf .
there are several ways to become a werewolf .
they include being given the power of shape shifting ... ... being bitten by a werewolf ...
go , harry !
go , harry !
aresto momentum !
he looks a bit peaky , doesn' t he ?
peaky ?
what do you expect ?
he fell over 100 feet .
let' s walk you off a tower and see what you look like .
probably a right sight better than he normally does .
how are you feeling ?
oh , brilliant .
you gave us a right good scare .
what happened ?
well , you fell off your broom .
really ?
i meant the match .
who won ?
no one blames you , harry .
dementors aren' t supposed to be on the grounds .
dumbledore' s furious .
after he saved you , he sent them off .
there' s something else you should know too .
when you fell , your broom sort of blew into the whomping willow , and ...
well ...
i' m sorry to hear about your broomstick .
is there no chance of fixing it ?
no .
professor , why do the dementors affect me so ?
i mean , more than everyone else ?
listen .
dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth .
they feed on every good feeling , every happy memory ... ... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences .
you are not weak , harry .
dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past .
horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine .
you have nothing to be ashamed of .
i' m scared , professor .
i' d consider you a fool if you weren' t .
i need to know how to fight them .
you could teach me .
you made the one on the train go away .
there was only one that night .
but you made it go away .
i don' t pretend to be an expert , harry .
but as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you ... ... perhaps i should teach you .
but after the holidays .
for now , i need to rest .
last call for hogsmeade !
come on , now !
guys , let me go .
clever , harry .
but not clever enough .
we' ve got a better way .
i' m trying to get to hogsmeade .
we know .
we' il get you there .
we' il show you a quicker way .
lf you pipe down .
bless him .
let me go !
come on , guys .
don' t ...
now , harry .
come and join the big boys .
what are you doing ? !
what' s this rubbish ?
" what' s this rubbish ? " he says .
it' s the secret to our success .
it' s a wrench giving it to you ...
but we' ve decided your needs are greater than ours .
george , if you will .
i solemnly swear that i am up to no good .
messrs. moony , wormtail , padfoot and prongs ... ... are proud to present the marauder' s map .
we owe them so much .

this is hogwarts .
and that ...
no .

dumbledore .
in his study .
pacing .

so this map shows ... ?
everyone .
where they are .
what they' re doing .
every minute .
every day .
brilliant !
where did you get it ?
from filch' s office .
first year .
there are seven secret passageways ... ... out of the castle .
we' d recommend this one .
the one eyed witch passageway .
leads you to honeyduke' s .
hurry .
filch is heading this way .
and don' t forget .
mischief managed .
otherwise , anyone can read it .
now , how much do you want ?
delicious .
it' s meant to be the most haunted building in britain .
did i mention that ?
twice .
do you want to move a bit closer ?
to the shrieking shack ?
actually , i' m fine here .
well , well .
look who' s here .
you two shopping for your new dream home ?
bit grand for you , isn' t it , weasle bee ?
don' t your family sleep in one room ?
shut your mouth , malfoy .
not very friendly .
boys , i think it' s time we teach weasle bee how to respect his superiors .
hope you don' t mean yourself .
how dare you talk to me !
you filthy little mudblood !
who is that ?
don' t stand there !
do something !
what ?
what' s up , malfoy ?
lost your skis ?
get out of the way !

malfoy !
wait !
wait !
harry !

that was not funny .
those weasels !

he won' t keep it .
he' il turn it over to professor mcgonagall .
aren' t you ?
sure .
along with his invisibility cloak .
look who it is .
madam rosmerta .
ron fancies her .
that' s not true !
professor mcgonagall !
cornelius !
allow me , minister .
oh , hagrid ...
sorry about that .
rosmerta , my dear .
i hope business is good .
it' d be a lot better if the ministry wasn' t sending dementors ... ... into my pub every other night !
we have ...
we have a killer on the loose .
sirius black in hogsmeade !
and what would bring him here ?
