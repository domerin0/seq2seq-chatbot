what you' re doing up there in the infirmary , what it' s got to do with what we' re doing here ?
four days from now , on the night of the escape , we' il have 18 minutes to get the bars off the infirmary window , and for all seven of us to get across the wire and over the wall .
is that doable ?
of course .
maricruz , it' s me .
baby , what the hell is going on ?
well , hector says that you can serve your full sentence .
what are you doing here ?
where' s maricruz ?
she' s not gonna be coming around here anymore .
this is a joke , right ?
she' s with me now .
i just need to know what michael scofield wanted from you in exchange for the green card .
why would you need a credit card in prison ?
if i' d have known that this is how this whole thing was gonna turn out ,
i' d have gotten some crap job with the feds .
keep talking like that , i' m gonna be forced to put a bullet in your head .
i need to get out while i still got my life .
daddy !
daddy !
things have changed .
i want in .
what' s up ?
we' ve got too many people .
i' ve done the math , and one of them has to go .
sorry to keep you waiting .
oh , it' s , uh , not a problem .
hmm .
impressive resume .
thank you .
tell me why you chose to pursue a career in engineering .
well , um ,
i' ve always been interested in , uh , structure , geometry .
how things fit together .
how an object that , uh , performs a function can ... also be a work of art .
what about the future ?
where do you see yourself in five years ?
one suit , black .
that baby boy all growed up yet ?
oh , he' s gonna raise hell the next few years .
take after his mama .
yeah , you know , it' s the same old same up here .
but , uh ... things are getting pretty tense ,
like they' re fixin ' to , uh , collide .
you know what i mean , jimmy ?
there' s a potential , uh , situation .
i found our access to the infirmary building , but i' m gonna need some time to make it work .
how much time ?
enough for me to find my way up a 20 foot vertical drain pipe without using a ladder .
i' il probably need to skip pi tomorrow if i want to get this thing done .
can' t just skip it .
it ain' t class .
what if one of the bulls decide to drop in ?
well , i don' t have a choice , do i ?
once we get through the pipe below the guards ' room , it will be a whole lot easier .
i can come and go without using the door , and with westmoreland as a lookout , we' il have one more man available for dig .
westmoreland' s gonna be a problem .
all seven of us can' t break over that wall in 18 minutes .
you said it yourself : it' s impossible .
listen , man , i' m telling you , one of us has got to take a hike .
i know .
mind if i share that with the rest of the class ?
apparently , college boy here did the math .
figured out that we got too many clowns in the car .
so , one of us is in here digging , but his seat ain' t guaranteed .
how is this your problem , man ?
he doesn' t know what he' s talking about .
i' m not gonna dig if i' m not gonna go .
we need to make a decision on who gets cut .
well , i think we can all agree who that should be .
right ?
oh , pardon me for interrupting .
but , uh ... what' s that smell ?
it smells a little like ... conspiracy .
we need to get back to work .
yeah , before you do , i have an announcement to make .
i' ve been growing leery of the way y' all talk , like i' m a lesser man .
so , i bought an insurance policy .
i called up my guy on the outside , and i told him about our plan .
and i told him , in all likelihood , i' il be seeing him next week , but ... if he don' t hear from me five minutes before the escape , and 20 minutes after ,
i told him to call up the warden , blow the whistle on the whole thing .
so if you all got ideas about getting rid of me ...
i suggest you make other plans .
son of a bitch has got a countermove for everything .
not for this .
odd men out me and you .
what do you mean ?
look who you' re walking with right now .
you should be up there , calling the shots with the rest of the suits .
yeah .
so ?
so ?
scofield is only here for one reason : his brother .
and he only needs two things : the old man' s money , and the mob boss' s plane .
he don' t need you .
you just happened to be in the same cell when he got here .
you and the toilet .
i' ve done a lot of work on this thing .
exactly , and me , too .
yeah , we' re just the damn laborers on this thing , man .
and the night that fish goes into that hole , you think he wants to carry all that extra baggage ?
' cause that' s all we are .
i don' t know about you , but i' m going .
how much does he tell you , anyways ?
or does he keep it all to himself ?
yeah , he probably tells you , the less you know , the better , right ?
you don' t know what you' re talking about .
he tells me everything .
if he tells you everything , then you don' t need him .
now , we can go by ourselves , me and you .
or , you know , you can wait and see if scofield really wants to carry heavy weight .
it' s up to you , popi .
yo , i still waitin ' .
what for ?
i swiped you that watch , man .
where' s my pl ?
that' s not gonna happen .
you promised .
i said i' d think about it .
maybe somewhere down the road .
yeah .
ain' t gonna hold my breath .
what do you want me to do ?
get somebody !
now !
no , no , no !
no , they see a bullet , they' re gonna call the cops .
we don' t have a choice , okay ?
i' m not gonna let you die .
find it , find it !
find it !
what ?
the bullet just find it and dig it out .
i can' t .
do it !
where' s scofield ?
there you are .
i just looked for you in your cell .
couldn' t find you anyplace .
i couldn' t find your credit card , either .
you know the one i' m talking about .
the one your whore wife trunked in the other day .
she told me all about it .
maybe whore' s too strong .
what do you call a girl who married a felon to get into the united states ?
why' d she have to come here for , anyway ?
no strip clubs in whazistan ?
officer bellick .
captain .
fine .
do you mind conducting your inquisitions on your own time , please ?
i have a schedule to maintain .
excuse me , doctor .
i was just asking mr.
scofield about the contraband he had his stripper wife trunk in the other day .
but you go ahead .
your job' s more important .
he' s had it out for me since the day i got here .
hold still , please .
sorry .
i only married her ... so she could get her green card .
i saw you coming out of the conjugal room .
that' s just business .
you don' t have to explain it to me , michael .
i know .
but i want to .
d. b. ?
oh , is that who you is now ?
i thought you was just a cowboy .
take a couple of steps back , boy .
you know what i can' t understand is , why somebody like you wants to get out of here anyway .
how you going to survive , huh ?
the world' s all different now .
it' s scary ...
they got computer phones , boobies made out of silicone .
you wouldn' t know what to do .
i don' t have to justify myself to you .
oh , you' re going to have to .
them old bones just going to be dragging us down .
maybe i' il just snap a few of ' em right now .
take your best shot .
hey , break it up down there !
bow out , cowboy .
i' m not going to warn you no more .
what' s up ?
records from the phone in the yard .
james bagwell .
lives down in gary .
t bag' s insurance policy ?
yeah .
my guy' s going to lock him up in a moving van for a couple days until we' re in the clear .
moving van ?
yeah .
don' t worry , he can breathe and all .
we do it all the time .
what about t bag ?
he' s no longer a threat .
trust me .
you james bagwell ?
got a delivery for you .
yeah ?
yeah .
you all right ?
yeah .
ma' am ?
yes ?
can i speak with you , please ?
of course .
you stay right here , okay ?
is he going to be okay ?
we don' t know yet .
he' s lost a lot of blood .
i was going to call the police , but i wanted to speak to you first .
his wound is obviously the product of a gunshot .
you need to be honest with me .
what was he doing when he got shot ?
he was in the garage , underneath his car .
he' s in surgery right now .
the blood loss has caused his muscle tissue to suffer from a lack of oxygen .
he' s also sustained a fair amount of damage to his shoulder , and with a bullet there' s always an increased risk of infection .
so , he' s going to have to be admitted .
is there anyone you should call ?
any family ?
no .
it' s just me .
all right , well ...
i' il let you know as soon as he' s in recovery .
thank you .
yeah .
are you there yet ?
almost .
you remember , be patient .
follow his lead .
we want the trifecta today .
yeah , i' m on it .
it' s me .
yeah .
i got some bad news .
yeah , like what ?
the job you ordered went bad .
the guy was a paranoid , he had a gun ... one thing led to another .
what , he' s dead ?
yeah .
and , unfortunately ... there was a kid there .
what are you ...
what are you talking about ?
you killed a kid ?
it was unintentional .
it' s a kid , man .
i know , i' m sorry .
sob used him as a shield .
a boy or a girl ?
i don' t know .
boy .
how old ?
four , maybe five .
who' s here to see me ?
hell if i know .
some lady .
baby .
hi .
you look so beautiful .
i came here cause i have to tell you something .
what ?
i' m pregnant , fernando .
pregnant ?
with your baby .
i' m going to have your son .
you ... you' re going to ...
we ...
we' re going to have a baby ?
oh , yeah , papi , you hear that ?
i' m going to be a dad !
i' m not finished !
what , mami , what ?
okay , hector ... he asked me to marry him .
what ?
look , it' s crazy , i know .
well , tell him no .
tell him you' re having my son .
we' re going to be a family .
fernando ...
look , my mom , she says ... that having a baby is the hardest job in the whole world .
and it' s even harder if i do this by myself .
but all i know is is i' m really scared .
i' m really scared to do this alone .
you' re not going to have to .
well , i haven' t told him no yet .
wait , wait .
you' re not actually considering this .
oh , baby ...
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
oh , my god , baby , you got to stop listening to these people .
they' re poisoning your brain .
your hormone things they' re out of whack .
you' re not thinking straight .
this is our child we' re talking about .
i want you to listen to me .
i want you to wait .
i' m going to be out .
sooner than you think .
you keep on telling me that .
all right , visiting time is up .
let' s go .
tell me you' re going to wait .
hands off , sucre !
you' re all i got left in the world , baby .
please .
i love you .
but you' il learn to love again , right ?
tell me you' re going to tell him no , honey .
i don' t know .
i don' t know anything any more .
sucre .
come on .
the kid' s here .
perfect .
follow him back to the lawyers and call me back .
where are you going ?
i' il be back in ten minutes .
what do you have to do ?
it' s complicated .
i can' t explain .
but if it works ... you' il see soon enough .
i want to go with you .
i want to see now .
someone has to stay here .
i need a lookout .
i' m always on lookout .
you' re my cellmate .
who else is going to do it ?
i' il be back in ten minutes , okay ?
okay .
we' re all lined up for tomorrow .
where do you want him ?
john ?
tomorrow .
where do you want t bag : in the shop or the shed ?
shh ...
i don' t care .
you decide .
thank god .
are you okay ?
yeah , i' m okay .
she didn' t do anything .
she didn' t deserve this .
i know .
here you go , man .
yeah , yeah .
these were seriously hard to get .
what you need them for anyway ?
none of your business .
thank you for waiting , theodore .
i don' t mean to deny your time in the yard .
what' s this all about ?
i , uh ...
i' m afraid i have some terrible news .
you cousin james was shot and killed in his home yesterday .
his son , james junior was killed , as well .
i' m very , very sorry .
what does it mean ?
am i chosen ?
or what ?
often , the lord appears when you' re in particular need of forgiveness .
maybe that' s what' s happening right now .
john , it' s never too late .
if you agree to accept christ into your heart and turn from your sin , he will forgive you and save you in eternity .
do you agree ?
revelation chapter three .
jesus said , " behold , i stand at the door and knock .
if any man hear my voice and open the door ,
i will come into him .
he got to the infirmary building last night .
through the old sewer pipe .
it' s the same pipe that runs under the guards ' room .
that' s all i know .
that' s the little thumb sucker that swiped my watch .
who ?
tweener ?
solid gold .
took it right off my arm .
it was a half hour before i even noticed it .
whose was it in the first place ?
i don' t care that you stole it .
you can tell me .
michael scofield .
what are you looking at ?
i' il be right around the corner .
westmoreland !
you scared me , boss .
get back to work .
all right , let' s go !
move it , scofield .
as for me , i will call upon god , and the lord shall save me .
i cry aloud , and he' il hear my voice .
he shall hear my voice .
he shall hear my voice .
he shall hear my voice .
he shall hear my voice .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
well , keep an eye on the tier for me , will you ?
when are we getting out of here exactly ?
i need to know the time .
as soon as possible .
as soon as possible " is not a specific time .
you tell abruzzi the time ?
yes , because he needs to know .
why does he need to know and i don' t ?
because he' s arranging the plane .
why the sudden curiosity ?
why would you want to be responsible for potentially dangerous information ?
the less you know , the better .
it' s for your own good .
i have to go .
i' il meet you in pl .
stealing from a guard .
you can get thrown in the shu for that , maybe even add a few years to your bid .
i don' t know ...
don' t deny it .
i already know it' s true .
lucky for you , i got pull some around here .
i can make this sort of thing go away , like it never even happened .
mmm .
that' s good .
now ...
i' m sure you' ve heard the word " rat .
i don' t like it .
snitch , " neither .
those sort of words aren' t appropriate for what i need from you .
what i need is a little information .
like when you' re hanging out with scofield ... ... just come back and tell me what he said .
i got an extra burger .
but , man , i' m full .
what do you say , kiddo ?
you want a cheeseburger ... or do you want to go to the shu ?
that' s my boy .
hey , honey , what are you doing here ?
i thought you left .
what' s wrong ?
i , um ...
i' ve been thinking .
i think we need to make a change .
what are you talking about ?
remember when we first got married , and we thought about moving out west ?
yeah , we were 22 .
well , maybe we should give it a shot .
it' s not too late .
i don' t understand .
what brought this on ?
it' s just work .
i' m tired of being on the road and working for somebody else , while you sit at home all alone , night after night .
i want our lives to be about us .
i do , too , but there' s so much to think about , like the kids and the house .
we got to go .
you' re in trouble , aren' t you ?
oh .
the crowd has thinned out in here .
how you doing , sucre ?
almost got it .
switch me out .
you' re up , then westmoreland .
we got to get through .
michael' s gonna be coming back this way .
hello ?
veronica donovan ?
who is this ?
it , it doesn' t matter who i am .
don' t hang up .
i have information that you may be interested in information that will lead to the exoneration of lincoln burrows .
what ?
what is it ?
i can' t tell you that now .
meet me tonight at the highland cafe on kennedy avenue .
this isn' t a trap .
i will tell you everything you need to know .
highland cafe , 8 : 00 p . m .
all right , that' s enough .
leave us alone .
you sure ?
get out of here .
you don' t have to do this .
you don' t have to do this .
you don' t have to do this .
you brought it on yourself .
i' m just an emissary for all the pain and suffering you caused , all the families you ruined , all the kids .
what about jimmy ?
he had nothing to do with this .
you didn' t need to kill him .
and what about his beautiful son ?
he had his whole life in front of him .
you didn' t need to kill a beautiful child .
after all i' ve done , maybe i do deserve to die , maybe i do .
but you are no better than me .
but i can be , if i want .
god has given me the chance to choose .
maybe i should give you a chance as well .
yes , anything , anything , please .
please .
please .
back out .
of the escape ?
or die .
i would , i ...
i wouldn' t make it out there , anyway not with my proclivities .
i want you to give me your word .
you hear me ?
i want you to give me your word !
yeah , you got it , john .
you got it .
come on , you got it .
please .
swear .
i' m out , i swear !
i swear to god !
i' m out , okay , i sw ...
all right .
all right !
i have forgiven you .
i have forgiven you .
you just have to pray that the lord jesus christ will do the same .
hey , john , you know , actually , about jesus ...
say hi to him for me , will you ?
i' m through .
keep it up .
come on , stomp it .
bulls .
you got to stall them .
we' re not ready .
hey , boss .
what you doing out here , linc ?
taking a break .
got to check the status in there .
it' s all good .
then you won' t mind me checking it out .
hey .
