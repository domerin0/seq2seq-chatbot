what is it ?
my boy' s not well .
what ?
fire !
let' s go !
i' il get permission to kill him .
wait !
only he can kill the one .
so ...
he' s just a monster .
we can' t trust him .
this is 01 .
request permission to kill .
tsugumu ...
connect me to captain kurashima .
i must know if the wife and son are okay .
tsugumu !
mrs. maki !
over there .
how is tsugumu ?
he' s in there .
he' s still unconscious .
i' m sure he' il make it .
he' s his dad' s son .
right ?
yes !
thank you .
but ... my boy has a congenital blood disease .
if it' s a case of that ...
mrs. maki ...
you must believe he' il make it .
that' s right .
he' il be okay .
he sensed his son was ill , and fled .
he' il go there .
t he goes there , what' il you do to him ?
you don' t need to know that .
an alarm' s been given .
the army' s evacuating inhabitants .
it' s like shinjuku is under marshal law .
what are you thinking ?
if i fight him ...
i might die .
please .
let me see my son .
just one glance .
let him go .
ten minutes .
no more .
understood .
maki !
mister !
maki !
i' m sorry .
yoko ...
how' s tsugumu ?
his blood is normal .
there are no other unusual symptoms .
why' d he faint then ?
probably psychological fatigue .
we' il keep him overnight and leave him on a drip .
excuse me .
he' s still such a small kid .
tsugumu ...
i' il stay with you .
i won' t go anywhere .
i' m okay .
go to work .
tsugumu ...
never mind my work .
it does .
flying a plane has been your dream .
i like the sky , too , so go to work .
i' il try to get better , too .
then you' il give me a ride in your plane .
will you promise ?
i promise .
shunichi ...
even it we quarreled ,
i smiled when you went off to fly .
i always tried to do so .
now go .
be careful .
i will .
goodbye .
if you didn' t return , i was going to kill the one myself .
even if i had to die .
when his tail was cut in pieces , we used them to develop poisonous bullets .
i' m not sure if they work .
but it' s worth trying .
when you talk about him , you stifle your emotions .
is that your " supernatural power " again ?
i don' t know .
just feels that way .
udo ... was my lover .
we' d have married .
we' d have had a family like yours , too .
a common but warm family .
at that laboratory ...
i couldn' t kill him .
are you ... going to kill me ?
my mistake killed many people .
i' il get him this time .
no .
that' s ... my job .
what kept you so long ?
are you under the colonel' s orders ?
that' s right .
let' s go .
hold it .
your mistake killed many of my men .
i can' t let you go .
no more victims , but we need his help .
just one more time ... trust us .
stand by for now .
he' s absorbed many creatures ... and developed himself .
what a grotesque form he must have ...
i can' t even imagine .
tell me .
what ?
i still have my conscience .
what about him ?
weren' t we affected by the same light ?
no .
he was affected by a different light .
two different lights .
he got the bad one .
he was unfortunate .
it makes no sense , but it' s fact .
but , chances are ...
sara ...
why are you here ... ?
i woke to find ...
i' m here .
tell me , what happened to me ?
i knew it .
he still has human consciousness .
it' s just a monster using his body .
who is he ?
sara , where ... am i ?
you are ... in heaven .
heaven ?
that' s right .
you are ... already dead .
sara , you shot five times , but hit me only once .
aim more accurately .
tears clouding your eyes ?
stupid girl !
goodbye , my dear !
die !
you' re in the way !
i' il kill you all !
you aren' t human anymore .
i won' t ... forgive you !
you' re in the way !
what' s that ?
miku !
you okay ?
you alright ?
this way !
hurry !
i can fly .
i can fly in the sky !
it' s amazing !
it has wings .
the monster is spreading its wings .
what a grotesque sight !
i don' t know how to describe it .
it looks ike ...
like ...
demon ...
this is it .
30, 000 feet high .
all alone .
piercing through the air .
it' s like i' m a light now .
i' m like ... a silver meteor .
burn !
burn all the humans !
is that all you got ?
my power' s fading .
why ?
your merger ... isn' t perfect .
you should' ve eaten humans like did .
you fool !
your body ... can' t endure more fighting .
if i die ... what' il happen to you ?
probably ...
i shall die with you .
what about the evil ?
no !
i can' t fall yet .
no !
i have a ... promise to keep .
i' il kill that evi .
that is my ...
last mission .
you still alive ?
die !
don' t shoot !
go round it !
maki !
how quiet .
will i die this time ?
maki ...
i needed your life ... to fulfill my mission .
that' s alright .
i realize now , meeting you was ... my fate .
fate ?
we fighter pilots ... cannot choose our planes .
if our plane goes out of order ... we' il die , no matter how good we are .
but we regard that ... as our fate .
and we flew .
meeting you ...
i had the best flight ever .
so ...
i have no regrets .
are you sure ... you have no regrets ?
just one .
i couldn' t keep my promise to my son .
my regret is ... that i couldn' t fly with him .
it' s been a month since that nightmare .
but the remnants of destruction are still everywhere .
what impressed people more was that super human figure .
he killed the monster and left .
who on earth was he ?
will he appear before us again someday ?
ultraman .
see you later !
be careful !
amazing !
i' m really flying !
you like it ?
yeah .
thanks for keeping our promise .
but ... it wasn' t only me ... that helped to keep the promise .
what ?
who else ?
a friend of mine who went back to the sky .
a friend ?
the silver meteor i dreamed of .
thank you ...
ultraman .
i like my dad as a pilot .
when i grow up ,
i' il become a pilot like him .
i want to fly in the sky , too .
that' s my dream .
