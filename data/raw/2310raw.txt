stalker
what was it ?
a meteorite ?
a visit of inhabitants of the cosmic abyss ?
one way or another , our small country has seen the birth of a miracle the zone .
we immediately sent troops there .
they haven' t come back .
then we surrounded the zone with police cordons ...
perhaps , that was the right thing to do .
though , i don' t know ...
from an interview with nobel prize winner , professor wallace .
why did you take my watch ?
where are you going , i' m asking you ?
you gave me your word and i believed you .
all right , you' re not thinking about yourself , but what about us ?
did you think about your child ?
she' s just getting used to you , and you start it again !
you' ve made an old woman of me .
you' ve ruined my life .
not so loud , you' il wake up monkey .
i can' t wait for you forever .
i' m going to die !
you wanted to start working !
you' ve been promised a normal human work !
i' il be back soon .
you' il be back to prison !
though this time you' il get ten years , not five !
and for ten years you will have neither your zone , nor anything !
and i' il be dead in the meantime .
oh god , for me it' s prison everywhere !
let me go !
no !
let go , i said !
go !
and may you rot there !
be damned the day when i met you , bastard !
god himself has cursed you by giving you this child !
and me too , because of you , jerk !
my dear , our world is hopelessly boring .
therefore , there can be no telepathy , or apparitions , or flying saucers , nothing like that .
the world is ruled by cast iron laws , and it' s insufferably boring .
alas , those laws are never violated .
they don' t know how to be violated .
so don' t even hope for a ufo , that would have been too interesting .
and how about the bermuda triangle ?
you' re not going to deny ...
i am .
there is no bermuda triangle .
there' s only triangle abc that equals triangle a prim , b prim , c prim .
do you feel the boredom contained in this assertion ?
to live in the middle ages was interesting .
every home had its house spirit , and every church had its god .
people were young !
now every fourth is an old person .
it' s so boring , my angel .
but you said that the zone was the product of a superior civilization ...
it must be boring , too , all those laws , triangles , and no house spirits , and no god , that' s for certain .
because if god is also a triangle , then i don' t know what to think .
it' s for me !
great !
goodbye , my dear friend .
this lady was so kind as to agree to go with us to the zone .
she' s a very courageous woman .
her name is ...
i beg your pardon , your name is .. ?
are you really a stalker ?
wait ...
i' il explain everything .
go ...
what a cretin !
you did get drunk after all .
me ?
what do you mean ?
i had a drink , like one half of the population does .
the other half gets drunk .
including women and children .
i just had a drink though .
damn it , what a mess here .
go on , drink .
we' ve got time .
how about a glass for the road ?
what do you think ?
take it away .
i see .
dry law .
alcoholism is a scourge of mankind .
all right , we' il drink beer .
is he with us ?
never mind , he' il sober up .
he needs to go there , too .
are you really a professor ?
if you don' t mind .
then let me introduce myself .
my name is ...
your name is writer .
well .
and what is my name ?
yours ?
professor .
i see .
i' m a writer , so , naturally , everyone calls me writer for some reason .
and what do you write about ?
about the readers .
obviously , there' s nothing else one should write about .
one should write about nothing at all .
and what are you ?
a chemist ?
a physicist rather .
that must be boring , too .
searching for the truth .
it' s hiding and you keep searching for it .
you dig in one place eureka !
the nucleus is made of protons .
you dig in another great !
triangle abc equals triangle a prim , b prim , c prim .
with me it' s quite different .
while i am digging for the truth , so much happens to it that instead of discovering the truth
i dig up a heap of , pardon ...
i' d better not name it .
you' re lucky !
but imagine some antique pot displayed in a museum .
it was used at its time as a receptacle of food leftovers , but now it' s an object of universal admiration for its laconic pattern and unique form .
everyone goes oh ! and ah !
and suddenly it turns out that it' s not antique at all , that some joker has palmed it off on the archeologists just for fun .
strange as it may seem , the admiration dies off .
those connoisseurs ...
is it what you think about all the time ?
god forbid !
in fact , i don' t think much .
it' s not good for me .
it' s impossible to write , thinking all the time of success or failure .
naturlich !
but if no one is going to read me in one hundred years , why the hell should i write at all ?
tell me , professor , why did you let yourself be mixed up in all this ?
what do you need the zone for ?
i' m a scientist in some sense .
but what do you need it for ?
you' re an " in " writer .
women must be running after you in flocks .
my inspiration has been lost , professor .
i go begging for it .
have you been used up ?
what ?
yes , i guess , in a way .
do you hear it ?
our train .
have you taken the roof off the car ?
yes , i have .
luger , if i don' t come back , call on my wife .
damn it , i forgot to buy cigarettes .
don' t go back .
why ?
you must not .
you' re all like this .
like what ?
believing such nonsense .
well , i' d better leave it for a rainy day .
are you really a scientist ?
down !
don' t move !
go and look , is there anyone there ?
move it , for god' s sake !
there' s no one there .
go to the other exit .
where on earth did you look , writer ?
you didn' t forget the jerry can ?
no .
it' s full .
everything i told you before ... is a lie .
i don' t give a damn about inspiration .
how would i know the right word for what i want ?
how would i know that actually i don' t want what i want ?
or that i actually don' t want what i don' t want ?
they are elusive things : the moment we name them , their meaning disappears , melts , dissolves like a jellyfish in the sun .
my conscience wants vegetarianism to win over the world .
and my subconscious is yearning for a piece of juicy meat .
but what do i want ?
world domination .
quiet !
why a diesel locomotive in the zone ?
it services the outpost .
it won' t go any farther .
they don' t like going there .
take your places !
everybody here ?
the guards have arrived .
tell them to turn the tv off .
hurry !
go look if there s a trolley on the tracks .
what trolley ?
go back , i' il do it .
the jerry can !
give it to me !
get rid of your knapsack , it' s hampering you .
you may travel light , if you wish , as if going for a stroll .
if someone gets hit , don' t shout or rush about .
if they see you , they' il kill you .
when everything settles down , crawl back to the outpost .
they' il pick you up in the morning .
can they catch up with us ?
they fear it like the plague .
fear what ?
here we are ... home , at last .
how quiet it is .
this is the quietest place in the world .
you' il see for yourselves .
so beautiful here .
not a single soul here .
what about us ?
three men can' t spoil the place in one day .
why ?
they can .
it' s strange that flowers don' t smell .
or have i ...
do you feel anything ?
i feel the stench of the bog .
no , that' s the river .
there' s a river here .
there was a flower bed nearby , but porcupine had trampled it down .
the smell lingered for many years though .
why did he do it ?
i don' t know .
i asked him why , too .
you' il understand later .
i think he just came to hate the zone .
porcupine , that' s his name ?
a nickname , like yours .
he had been taking people to the zone for years , and no one could stop him .
he was my teacher .
he opened my eyes .
he was called teacher then , not porcupine .
then something happened to him , something broke in him .
though i think he was punished .
will you help me ?
tie those strips of bandage to the nuts .
and i ... will go for a walk .
i need to do something ...
don' t go anywhere .
where' s he going ?
he wants to be alone , i guess .
why ?
even with the three of us together , i feel weird .
a date with the zone .
he' s a stalker .
and what does that mean ?
you see , being a stalker is some sort of calling .
i thought he' d be different .
like what ?
well , you know , the leather stockings , chingachgook sort of things ...
his background is even more frightful .
several times in prison , then he was harmed here .
he has a mutant daughter , " a victim of the zone " as they call it .
they say she' s got no legs .
and what about this porcupine ?
what does it mean , " was punished " ?
or was it just a figure of speech ?
one day porcupine returned from here and got rich overnight .
fabulously rich .
you call it punishment ?
a week later he hanged himself .
why ?
quiet !
what was that ?
presumably a meteorite fell down here about twenty years ago .
it had burned down the settlement .
they searched for this meteorite , but never found it , of course .
why " of course " ?
then people began disappearing here .
they came here and never returned .
so it was concluded ... that this meteorite was not really a meteorite .
at first ... they circled the place with barbed wire to scare off the inquisitive .
all this gave rise to rumours that there' s a place in the zone ...
where wishes come true .
naturally , they began to guard the zone like the apple of their eye .
who knows what kind offish someone might cherish .
what was it if not a meteorite ?
i told you , no one knows .
and what do you think ?
nothing .
or anything .
a message to mankind , as one of my colleagues says .
or a gift .
some gift .
why on earth would they do it ?
to make us happy .
the flowers are blooming again , but they don' t smell for some reason .
sorry for leaving you two here , but it was too early to go anyway .
did you hear it ?
maybe someone lives here ?
who ?
you told me yourself about some tourists camped here when the zone originated .
there' s no one in the zone and there can' t be .
well , it' s time .
how are we going to return ?
they don' t return here .
what do you mean ?
we' il go as we agreed .
i' il show the direction .
any deviation from it is dangerous .
the first landmark is that last pole .
you go first , professor .
now you .
try to follow in his footsteps .
oh , my god !
and where are ...
did they remain here like that ?
those people ?
who knows .
i remember them packing at the station , getting ready to come here .
i was just a boy .
we all thought then that somebody wanted to conquer us .
you first , professor .
now you , writer .
your room is over there .
we' il go this way .
why were you hiking up the price ?
it' s so close at hand .
yes , but the hand has to be very long .
we don' t have such a hand .
don' t !
leave it alone !
don' t touch it !
don' t touch it , i said !
are you crazy ?
what' s the matter with you ?
it' s not the place for leisurely strolls .
the zone wants to be respected .
otherwise it will punish .
don' t you ever try it again ...
have you no tongue or what ?
i warned you , didn' t i ?
are we to go there ?
yes .
up , enter it and to the left .
only we are not going this way .
we' il go around .
why ?
people don' t go this way .
in the zone , the longer way , the less risk .
and to go straight ahead is fatal ?
he told you it' s dangerous .
and making a detour' s not dangerous ?
it is .
but they don' t go this way .
what do i care that they don' t ?
what if i take a chance ...
listen , what' s the matter with you ...
to go all the way around !
when everything' s so close .
here a risk , there a risk .
what the hell !
you' re being very flippant about this .
i' m fed up with all those nuts and bandages .
you may do as you wish , but i' m going .
you' re insane .
it' s you who are ...
may i ?
the wind is coming up ...
can you feel it ?
the grass ...
all the more so .
what do you mean ?
wait !
keep your hands off !
professor be my witness , i didn' t sent you there .
you go of your own will .
of my own will .
what else ?
nothing .
go .
god help you to be lucky .
listen !
should you notice something , or just feel something , go back at once , or ...
just don' t throw iron poles at me .
stop !
don' t move !
why did you do it ?
why did i do what ?
why did you stop him ?
i thought it was you ...
what' s up ?
why did you stop me ?
i didn' t stop you .
who did it then ?
you ?
who the hell knows ...
you' re smart , mister shakespeare .
to go straight ahead is scary , to go back is embarrassing .
so you gave yourself a command .
fear has made you come to your senses .
what ?
stop it .
why have you emptied the bottle ?
stop it , i said !
the zone is a very complicated system ... of traps , and they' re all deadly .
i don' t know what' s going on here in the absence of people , but the moment someone shows up , everything comes into motion .
old traps disappear and new ones emerge .
safe spots become impassable .
now your path is easy , now it' s hopelessly involved .
that' s the zone .
it may even seem capricious .
but it is what we' ve made it with our condition .
it happened that people had to stop halfway and go back .
some of them even died on the very threshold of the room .
but everything that' s going on here depends not on the zone , but on us !
so it lets the good ones pass and kills the bad ones ?
i don' t know .
i think it lets those pass who ... have lost all hope .
not good or bad , but wretched people .
but even the most wretched will die if they don' t know how to behave .
you have been lucky , it just warned you .
i guess i' il wait for you here until you come back , made happy .
it' s impossible !
i' ve got sandwiches , a thermos ...
you won' t last even an hour here without me .
besides , one doesn' t return here the way one comes .
anyway , i would prefer ...
then we' re going back right away .
i' il return your money minus a certain sum for the trouble , so to speak ...
have you come to your senses , professor ?
all right .
go on , throw your nut .
part two
stalker
where are you ?
come here !
are you tired ?
oh , god !
judging by his tone , he' s going to start sermonizing again .
let everything that' s been planned come true .
let them believe .
and let them have a laugh at their passions .
because what they call passion actually is not some emotional energy , but just the friction between their souls and the outside world .
and most important , let them believe in themselves
let them be helpless like children , because weakness is a great thing , and strength is nothing .
when a man is just born , he is weak and flexible , when he dies , he is hard and insensitive .
when a tree is growing , it' s tender and pliant , but when it' s dry and hard , it dies .
hardness and strength are death' s companions .
pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness of being .
because what has hardened will never win .
come here !
we' re progressing well .
soon we' il come to a dry tunnel , after that it will get easier .
knock on wood .
are we on our way already ?
of course .
why ?
i thought you just wanted to show us something .
what about my knapsack ?
what about it ?
i left it there .
i didn' t know we were going .
there' s nothing we can do about it .
no , we have to go back .
it' s impossible !
i can' t do without my knapsack !
can' t you understand that no one here has ever come back the same way ?
forget about your knapsack .
what have you got there , diamonds ?
the room will give you anything you want .
really .
it will drown you in knapsacks .
how far is it , this room ?
if you go straight , about 200 meters , but there' s no going straight here .
let' s go .
give up your empiricism , professor .
miracles are outside empiricism .
remember how st. peter was nearly drowned ?
go , writer .
go where ?
up these stairs .
professor , where are you ?
here is the dry tunnel !
you call it dry ?
this is a local joke .
normally one has to swim here .
wait , where' s professor ?
what ?
professor has disappeared !
how could it happen ?
he was following you all the way .
he probably lagged behind and lost his way .
no , he didn' t lose his way !
he must' ve gone for the knapsack !
he won' t be able to make it now .
shall we wait for him ?
we can' t .
things change here every minute .
we' il have to go .
look !
what is it ?
how could it be ?
i already explained .
what did you explain ?
it' s the zone , don' t you understand ?
let' s go , quick .
it' s ...
there he is !
i' m certainly grateful to you that you ... but ...
how did you get here ?
mostly i had to crawl up here on my fours .
incredible .
how did you manage to overtake us ?
what do you mean , " overtake " ?
i came back here for the knapsack .
and how has our nut gotten here ?
oh , my god , that' s ... the trap !
porcupine put this nut here on purpose .
how could the zone let us through ?
oh god , i' m not going to take one more step until ...
i don' t like it .
that' s it !
we rest !
but keep off this nut , just in case .
sorry , but i thought that professor won' t be able to make it .
you see , i ...
i never know beforehand what kind of people i' m taking with me .
everything gets clear only here , when it' s too late .
what' s important is that professor' s bag with his underwear is safe .
don' t stick your nose in someone' s underwear if you don' t understand it .
what is there to understand ?
binomial theorem ?
some psychological abysses !
you have a bad reputation at your institute .
they don' t give you money for an expedition .
so you decide to pack a knapsack full of manometers and other shit ... penetrate the zone illegally ... and put all these miracles to an algebra test .
no one in the world has ever heard of the zone .
so we' il work a sure sensation !
the television , fans raving and bringing laurel wreaths .
mene mene , tekel , uprasin .
he deserves a nobel prize !
you lousy scribbler , a homespun psychoanalyst .
you' re only good for painting walls in public toilets , you blabbermouth .
no good .
too sluggish .
you don' t know how to do it .
all right .
i' m going to get a nobel prize .
and what are you after ?
want to bless mankind with the pearls of your purchased inspiration ?
i don' t care a damn about mankind .
of all your mankind
i' m interested only in one man myself .
whether i' m worth anything or i' m just shit like others .
and if you find out that you' re really ...
you know , mr. einstein , i have no wish to argue with you .
truth is born of argument , damn it !
listen , chingachgook ...
you' ve brought here many people .
not as many as i would like .
that' s not the point .
why did they come here ?
what did they want ?
happiness , i guess .
yes , but what kind of happiness ?
people don' t like to speak about their innermost feelings .
and it' s neither yours nor mine business .
in any case , you' ve been lucky .
as for me , i haven' t seen one happy man in my life .
me neither .
they return from the room and i lead them back , and we never see each other again .
it' s not that wishes come true immediately .
have you ever wished to use this room yourself ?
i' m fine as i am .
