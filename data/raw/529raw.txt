my god , she nearly got her head cut off .
when i get to america ,
i will not live in brentwood .
second floor .
in the most alds infested region of the globe ... where one in four is infected ...
andre' s idea of a joke was to put a young lman and a young naomi in my bed .
and no condom within 100 miles .
hello , mr. yuri .
hi .
we' d be happy to make you happy .
uh , i can' t .
i' d love to .
but i can' t .
don' t worry .
we don' t have anything .
how do you know ?
do we look like it ?
what if i have alds ?
don' t you worry ?
you worry too much .
why do you worry about something that can kill you in ten years when there are so many things that can kill you today ?
now ... ... how can we make you happy ?
by leaving .
these are my kalashnikov kids .
my boy brigades .
i can see what you are thinking , but we need every man we can get .
even if they' re not men ?
a bullet from a fourteen year old ... ... is just as effective as one from a forty year old .
often more effective .
no one can stop this bath of blood .
it' s not " bath of blood .
it' s " bloodbath .
thank you .
but i prefer it my way .
i am not going to pay your asking price .
we are not a rich people .
and besides , the market is already flooded with your kalashnikovs .
do you realize in some parts of my country you can get one for the price of a chicken ?
but you can' t just consider unit price .
you forget ancillary costs .
end user certificates need to be forged and notarized ,
shell companies set up , insurance purchased , pilots and crews hired .
not to mention bribes .
you can' t get a nut and bolt out of the eastern bloc without a bribe .
there' s one bribe for the nut , another for the bolt .
andy ... andy , listen to me .
this is an expensive proposition .
andy " ?
i am going to pay you in timber or stones .
i' il take the stones .
it' s kind of hard to get a tree trunk into my hand luggage .
i know you' re planning a new offensive .
if you can delay a week ,
i can get you armored personnel carriers .
they' d greatly reduce your casualties ... ... and give you a significant strategic advantage .
you know , they call me the lord of war .
but perhaps it is you .
it' s not " lord of war , " it' s " warlord .
thank you , but i prefer it my way .
conflict diamonds are a common currency in west africa , also referred to as " blood diamonds " since bloodshed is what they generally finance .
by the late ' 90s , my wealth had caught up to my lies about my welth .
even surpassed my lies .
i could even afford to become a patron of the arts .
it' s just that i can' t believe it .
well , of .. of course , it' s wonderful .
i just ...
i didn' t expect it to happen so soon .
yes .
well , that wou that would be great , too yeah .
it' s wonderful .
thank you so much .
it' s ...
yuri .
okay , thank you .
bye .
yuri , that was the dealer on the phone .
i just sold my first painting .
aah !
that' s fantastic .
uh , who bought it ?
it' s someone important .
they want to remain anonymous .
this is so wonderful !
how was your trip ?
you know , same old , same old .
where' s nicki ?
oh , in bed , i' m sorry .
he couldn' t stay up .
that' s best .
my first painting !
i' m officially an artist !
this calls for a drink .
what doesn' t ?
hi .
yuri , this is uh ...
candy .
candy .
of course .
any friend of my brother' s is a ... friend of my brother' s .
you have a beautiful ... everything .
yes , he does .
yes , i do .
i' m going to kiss nicki goodnight .
okay .
how are you , brother ?
well , you know , still the resident family fuckup .
yeah .
well , i guess someone has to do it .
well .
hey , ava knows , right ?
i never want to say anything ,
she doesn' t have to know .
she understands .
she' s a survivor , like me .
she may be a survivor , but she' s not like you .
really she doesn' t know how you pay for all this
we don' t talk about it .
how many car salesman talk about their work ?
huh ?
how many cigarette salesmen ? both their products kill more people every year than mine .
at least mine has a safety switch .
if those guys can leave their work at the office , so can l .
god damn , you are good !
you really are .
you almost had me convinced .
could you ... could you help me out with ...
why ?
why ?
why ?
why what ?
why ?
why ?
i don' t know .
why ...
i don' t know .
why what ?
why' re you so fucked up all the time ?
because i am .
i don' t know .
i didn' t know how much ava really knew ... and how much she ignored .
she never questioned how a guy in the transport business ... could afford to give her 18 carat diamond earrings .
i guess she didn' t want to hear the answer .
mostly , she seemed content that i was a good provider ... and as far as she was concerned , loyal .
despite the other women ...
i always made love to ava as if she was the only one .
i' m not saying i didn' t have setbacks .
it' s not called gunrunning for nothing . you gotta be fast on your feet .
some revolutions blow over the guns even get there .
there' s nothing' s more expensive for an arms dealer than peace .
truce ?
what do you mean , truce ?
the guns are already on their way .
peace talks .
all right , forget it .
i' il re route the shipment to the balkans .
when they talk about war , they keep their word .
of course , a new breed of gunrunner requires a new breed of cop .
henry , take park avenue .
take ' em on a tour of new jersey .
yuri , there are men going through our garbage cans .
well , it' s probably just some reporters
iooking for somebody else .
i have a feeling they don' t work for the tabloids .
yuri ... is there anything i should be worried about ?
no , nothing . nothing ?
i love you .
i love you , too .
sir .
i was now the best merchant of death alive .
i didn' t own my own plane , i owned a fleet .
running guns into liberia , sierra leone , or the lvory coast at least once a week .
most trips i had phony paperwork .
the deadline was tight and i had to cut corners ,
i had no paperwork at all .
but i wasn' t overly concerned .
there was hardly any radar over most of africa and even fewer people to watch it .
charlie echo lndia , ... re route to kabala airport ... ... on heading zero two nine . comply immediately .
yuri , what the fuck is going on ?
hello , southern ?
it' s yuri .
i sorry to call you on this number .
but i' ve got lnterpol' s all over my ass .
i can' t know you right now .
it' s uh , not a good time .
not a good time ?
motherfucker !
charlie , echo , lndia , comply immediately .
this is your last warning .
where was the first fucking warning ?
rock your wings if you intend to comply
i' m putting us down .
if you land , we' re going away .
i don' t have paperwork .
we' re in a flying fucking bomb !
they' re firing bullets at our bullets .
i' m putting us down .
okay , okay .
fuck !
this is charlie , echo , lndia .
request re route to kabala airport , bearing zero two nine .
no , not the airport .
there the highway .
it' s our only hope .
are you fucking mad ?
a pothole will set us off .
you underestimate yourself , alexei .
you' re the best .
you' re the shit , alexei , you' re the shit !
you' re the shit !
you' re the shit !
of course alexei wasn' t the best .
he' d come forty second out of forty three at the moscow flight school .
oh , god , what' s he doing ?
is this guy nuts ?
i can' t land there , sir .
kabala' s fifteen minutes away .
he can' t get far .
i want a truck on the tarmac .
we gonna be okay .
where are you going ?
as far from the evidence as we can get .
wait , there' s not going to be any evidence !
come here .
come here .
hey , don' t be shy .
here , look .
free sample help yourself , okay ?
free sample .
tell yourt friend .
gun for you .
happy times . come on .
help yourselves .
no charge .
everything goes .
guns , guns , guns , yes , come on up !
here !
you' re having fun now , huh ?
come on !
guns , guns , guns !
yes !
bullets , guns , grenades !
take ' em all .
take the whole crate .
go ahead .
gun , grenades , hooray !
bullets !
guns !
grenades !
yeah .
that one' s got your name on it .
you want one , too ?
come on .
don' t forget the bullets .
don' t forget the bullets .
how can you shoot a gun if you don' t have bullets ?
everything goes for free !
guns , grenades !
all you see .
bullets , guns , grenades .
hooray , hooray !
have the bullets .
what a cargo crew at heathrow airport does in a day took a bunch of malnourished sierra leonean locals ten minutes .
by the time agent valentine got there , you could find more guns on a plane full of quakers .
yuri orlov .
ow !
fuck !
you run from us ?
no , mbizi .
no !
can you run with no legs ?
let me make him disappear , mr valentine
around here , people disappear all the time .
i can' t do that .
look where we are .
who will know ?
we will .
he' s gonna get what' s coming to him .
i' m not as certain .
all right , get up .
what' s the charge ?
what are you doing in sierra leone ...
i' m on safari .
yeah ?
you' re hunting wildebeests with a submachine gun ?
do you also work with the park service ?
hunting without a license , is that the charge ?
why are we playing games ?
you traffic arms .
trade .
trade .
traffic .
you get rich by giving the poorest people on the planet the means to continue killing each other .
do you know why i do what i do ?
i mean , there are more prestigious assignments .
keeping track of nuclear arsenals ,
you' d think that' s more critical to world security , but it' s not .
no , nine out of ten war victims today are killed with assault rifles and small like yours .
those nuclear missiles ?
they sit in their silos .
your ak 47 ?
that is the real weapon of mass destruction .
i don' t want people dead , agent valentine .
i don' t put a gun to anybody' s head and make them shoot .
i admit , but shooting war is better for business , but i prefer people to fire my guns and miss .
just as long as they' re firing .
can i go now ?
you' ve got nothing on me .
except cuffs .
since you' re so concerned with the law , you must know that i' m legally permitted to hold you for twenty four hours without charging you .
you might ask why i would do that and i can assure you .
it' s not because i enjoy your company , because i don' t .
no , the reason why
i' il delay you for every second of the permissible twenty four hours
is i' m delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of your victims .
i don' t think of it as taking a day from you ... ... but giving a day to them .
some innocent man , woman , or child is going to have an extra day on this earth because you' re not free .
so , i will see you in twenty three hours and fifty five minutes , hm ?
valentine knew he didn' t have to guard me .
there was nowhere to go .
or maybe he was hoping the locals would tear me apart .
but they were too busy with the plane .
it' s like parking your car in certain neighborhoods in the bronx .
you just don' t do it .
the way i looked at it it' s the way of africa , maybe life .
everything that comes from the earth eventually returns .
even a 40 ton atonov 12 cargo plane .
a gift .
for you .
you know , you' ve arrived just in time .
i was afraid that he might die before you got your chance to kill him .
this man came here hoping to take your place .
is that not so ?
no , i' m not here to supply mr. baptiste .
i am here to supply his enemies .
i fear it' s a sale i shall never complete .
he killed your blood ... your uncle ... when he tried to kill you .
no .
no ?
you want that i should let him go ?
no .
i ...
you do want him dead .
you just ... don' t want to have to do it yourself .
so .
we will do this together .
this will be a bonding experience .
you know you can stop this any time that you want .
but i don' t think that you do .
just say the word .
say it .
stop .
stop .
i will get you another room , my friend .
with a much nicer view .
he ordered you brown brown , mr. yuri .
what ?
brown brown .
what is it ?
a mixture of cocaine ... ... and gunpowder .
they give it to the young boys before they do battle .
they' il do anything !
some other time .
i suggest you try it , at least once , mr. yuri .
why ?
' cause it' s your gunpowder .
even before that night ,
i' d started doing a lot of cocaine in west africa .
i' d never tried brown brown before , but then i' d never killed a man , either .
oh .
oh , i didn' t do anything , did l ?
i didn' t do anything , did l ?
you didn' t do much .
wait .
are you sick ?
slda ?
alds ?
ask the white man .
he will know .
sir , will my hand grow back ?
simeon .
remember , yuri , take sides .
simeon !
don' t !
he' s andre' s .
fuck andre !
fuck andre !
i' m sorry they don' t usually do that .
let me look it .
maybe i can fix it .
let me see it .
it' s the magazine .
give it to me .
fuck you !
i started to feel i' d been cursed . ... the curse of invincibility .
nicki , please , go to your room .
i don' t believe you .
can you prove any of this ?
mr. orlov goes to a lot of trouble to make his business look legitimate .
even to you .
perhaps especially to you .
i don' t expect we' il find anything here today .
so what do you want ?
i was hoping that you would help me .
i understand that uh ... your parents died tragically ?
the illegal firearms used to murder your mother and father were procured from men exactly like your husband .
i' d like you to leave .
okay .
gentlemen .
ava ?
ava , what' s wrong ?
i can' t wear the clothes .
can' t wear the jewelry .
can' t drive the car .
can' t live in this house .
everything' s got blood on it .
blood on it ?
what' s the matter with you ?
don' t be so melodramatic .
i' m melodramatic .
i' m a failed actress , remember ?
i told you , these people , it' s political .
they lie .
they' re liars .
look at me .
they lie to make themselves look good , okay ?
you can' t trust them .
it' s not just them .
don' t worry .
your family didn' t say anything .
they didn' t have to .
i sell people a means to defend themselves .
ava .
that' s all .
yuri , i see the news .
i see those pictures .
the guns are bigger than the boys !
there is nothing illegal about what i do !
i don' t care if it' s legal !
it' s wrong !
please , stop .
it makes no difference if i stop .
someone will take my place the next day .
so let them .
we have enough .
it' s not about the money .
then what is it ?
i' m good at it .
i feel like all i' ve done my whole life is be pretty .
i mean all i' ve done is be born .
i' m a failed actress , a failed artist .
i' m not much good as a mother .
i' m not even that pretty anymore .
i have failed at everything , yuri .
but i won' t fail as a human being .
my enemies had finally found a weapon that could hurt me .
for the next six months ,
i stopped running guns .
i went legitimate .
this is an untapped market .
i' m talking over five million cubic meters of timber in the first year alone .
over 100 exploitable species .
the oil ?
between you and me , this ...
ten thousand barrels a month ?
he must be lying .
he' s talking !
listen , there are gas reserves off the
ivory coast that opec doesn' t even know about .
the phone numbers all check out .
it' s all on the level .
no wonder valentine was confused .
thank god there are still legal ways to exploit developing countries .
the only problem with an honest buck is they' re so hard to make .
the margins are too low .
too many people are doing it .
still , i' d promised ava .
yuri , the president of liberia is on his way up .
he' s early .
i' il be back in a minute .
what the fuck are you doing here , andre ?
we are here for peace talks at the united nations .
so at the same time you thought you' d drop in on your arms dealer ?
well , i was beginning to wonder whether that was still your profession .
you know , you' re a hard man to get a hold of all of sudden .
that is a shame .
my son and i were hoping to do a little shopping . while in new york .
you know they' re watching you .
yes , i know they blame me .
they blame me for everything , those hypocrites .
there' re hunt for a witch .
witch hunt .
hostilities have escalated .
and they are making it very difficult for me to re supply .
that requires a man of your rare ingenuity .
i can' t help you , i' m sorry .
i understand .
due to our present situation we are compelled to be unusually generous .
so , see you soon , lord of war .
you still haven' t brought me the gun of rambo .
at four and a half months old ... a human fetus has a reptile' s tail ... a remnant of our evolution .
maybe that' s what i couldn' t escape .
you can fight a lot of enemies and survive , but if you fight your biology , you always lose .
you guys aren' t waiting to say goodbye ?
i' m not leaving for another ten minutes .
sorry , nicki has swim practice .
you know , i' m kind of glad you' re going .
you' ve been here so long you' re starting to get on my nerves .
this oil concession should be wrapped up by thursday .
i' il be back for the weekend .
we' il go somewhere .
the sea .
that would be fun .
come on .
hey .
you trust me , right ?
she looked me directly in the eye ... the way i' ve looked in the eyes of a thousand customs officials ... government bureaucrats and law enforcement agents .
yes , i trust you .
and she lied without flinching .
i' il see you , big guy .
bye papa .
she learned from the best .
have a good trip .
that' s him .
where are we going , mama ?
it' s a game , honey .
like hide and seek ?
yes .
like hide and seek .
i can always sense when i' m being tailed .
i know what to look for .
but then i' d never been tailed by the woman i love .
i can put myself in ava' s place .
she might' ve understood if the combination was the last four digits of my social security number ... my birth date , even her birth date , but not nicolai' s .
my son' s birthday unlocked what the government would later describe ... ... as " a catalogue of carnage .
nicki , stay right there .
come on , nicki .
come to see how the other half lives ?
i miss your borscht .
mom and dad say you' re clean .
yeah , you , too .
you went legit , huh ?
that' s hard to believe .
that' s because it' s not true .
only you know .
i' m leaving tonight on a job
i want you to come .
i can' t .
i' ve got a girlfriend .
i think she might be the one .
plus , i' m thinking of opening my own place .
maybe this trip will help .
it' s good money .
yuri , i' ve given my word .
no one has to know .
tell them we going for a little r and r.
what do you need me for , all of sudden ?
west africa' s fucked up .
more than usual .
i can' t trust anybody .
i need you to watch my back .
brothers in arms .
monrovia , liberia 2001
yuri !
welcome back .
welcome both of you .
welcome to democracy .
democracy ?
what have you been drinking , andy ?
huh , you have not seen the news .
you know they accuse me of rigging elections .
but after this , with your florida and you supreme court of kangaroos ,
now , the u. s. must shut up forever .
how do you do this , yuri ?
how do you do this , when they are watching all of my airspace ?
where there' s a will , there' s a weapon .
come on , where' s my fucking money ?
when it is delivered .
it is delivered .
this is not for me .
this is for my neighbors to the west .
the west ?
we' re going to sierra leone .
oh , yes .
and my son baptiste junior will go with you to make the proper introductions .
we have no trucks .
you will .
as soon as we get the food out of them .
gun of rambo .
mr. yuri , you' re a man of your word .
so where are we going ?
ruf the freedom fighters .
every faction in africa calls themselves by the noble names .
liberation this patriotic that ,
democratic republic of something or other .
i guess they can' t own up to what they usually are
federation of worse oppressors than the last bunch of oppressors .
often , the most barbaric atrocities occur when both combatants proclaim themselves " freedom fighters .
right , i' ve got 500 units , brand new right out of the box , all as clean as this .
what have you got ?
god !
oh , jesus .
god !
oh , jesus .
yuri , i need to talk to you .
not now .
now .
excuse me .
what ?
we can' t do this deal .
the fuck we can' t !
what' s the matter with you ?
look , over there .
as soon as we hand over the guns those people are going to die !
it' s not our business .
they killed a boy just now as young as nicki .
what is the holdup ?
there is no holdup .
i' il be right there .
we can' t control what they do .
no , no , today we can .
today we can .
yuri , they' re right there !
what do you think they' il do to us if we back out ?
they' il kill us .
and if we go ahead , what do you think they' il do to them ?
we' ve got to do something .
please , for fuck' s sake .
it' s not our fight .
please .
brothers in arms .
what is he saying ?
it' s the deal .
my brother' s not happy with the terms .
we' il work it out .
it' s nothing .
right ?
it' s nothing .
yeah .
nothing .
you' re right .
yuri , you' re right .
god , i' ve got to get my shit together .
this is not our fight .
right .
okay .
what' s the deal ?
300 rpgs , 500 assault rifles and 800 grenades .
i thought it was 1200 grenades .
i was so caught up in the deal ...
i never realized what was going on in vitaly' s head .
i thought it was 1200 grenades .
confused .
come to think about it , maybe i never understood what was going on in his head .
i beg your pardon .
may i see another stone ?
one thing i do understand for certain ... ... is that vitaly broke the cardinal rule of gunrunning .
never pick up a gun and join the customers .
what are you doing ?
something for yuri .
step away .
slow .
no , vit !
no !
vit !
only half the guns were gone ... so i was still entitled to half the diamonds .
if i took them , i was lost .
if i left them , i was lost .
the massacre played out exactly how vitaly predicted .
but then , a half dozen other massacres happened in sierra leone that week .
you can' t stop them all .
in my experience , you can' t stop any of them .
they say evil prevails when good men fail to act .
what they ought to say is , evil prevails .
i now shared even more in common ... with the leader of that country god seemed to have forsaken .
we saw something in each other that neither of us liked .
or maybe we were just looking in the mirror .
i paid a monrovian doctor twenty dollars to remove the lead from vitaly' s body and write a bogus death certificate .
i should' ve paid more .
i' ve smuggled millions of rounds of ammunition , and the bullet that lands me in jail ... is found under my dead brother' s rib .
yuri orlov .
we' re with the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms .
let me guess .
this is not about the alcohol or the tobacco .
crimean restaurant .
papa ?
both my sons are dead .
there are only two tragedies in life .
one is not getting what you want .
the other is getting it .
is this one of yours ?
jack valentine finally had what he wanted .
curiously , the death certificate says he died of heart failure .
falsifying a death certificate ?
that' s not gonna hold me .
you' re right .
as usual , you are right .
have you seen today' s paper ?
huh ?
fake end user certificates .
cut out companies , meticulously catalogued .
there is hardly a warlord , dictator , despot anywhere in the world that you' re a first name basis with .
it was your wife your trophy wife that led us to the prize .
it' s not her fault .
she' s just easier to follow than you are .
may l ?
yeah , go ahead .
enjoy it .
what ?
this .
tell me i' m everything you despise .
that i' m the personification of evil . what ? responsible for the breakdown of the fabric of society and world order .
i' m a one man genocide .
say everything you want to say to me now .
because you don' t have long .
are you paying attention ?
or are you delusional ?
you have broken every arms embargo written .
there is enough here to put you away for consecutive life sentences .
you are going to spend the next ten years of your life going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start serving your time .
i don' t think you fully appreciate the seriousness ... ... of your situation .
my family has disowned me .
my wife and son have left me .
my brother' s dead .
trust me .
i fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation .
but i promise you ,
i won' t spend a single second in a courtroom .
you are delusional .
i like you , jack .
well , maybe not , but i understand you .
let me tell you what' s gonna happen .
this way , you can prepare yourself .
okay .
soon there' s going to be a knock on that door and you will be called outside .
in the hall there will be a man who outranks you .
first , he' il compliment you on the fine job you' ve done that you' re making the world a safer place that you' re to receive a commendation and a promotion .
and then he' il tell you that i am to be released .
you' re gonna protest .
you' il probably threaten to resign .
but in the end , i will be released .
the reason i' il be released is the same reason you think ...
i' il be convicted .
i do rub shoulders with some of the most vile , sadistic men calling themselves leaders today .
but some of those men are the enemies of your enemies .
and while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss ... ... the president of the united states , who ships more merchandise in a day
i do in a year ... sometimes it' s embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns .
sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply forces he can' t be seen supplying .
so ... you call me evil , but unfortunately for you , i' m a necessary evil .
i would tell you to go to hell .
but i think you' re already there .
pleasure doing business with you .
most people are happy just to get out of jail .
i expect to be paid to leave .
i' m not a fool .
i know that just because they needed me that day didn' t mean they wouldn' t make me a scapegoat the next .
but i was back , doing what i do best .
umbrellas to the sahara ?
sun umbrellas .
you know who' s going to inherit the earth ?
arms dealers .
because everyone else is too busy killing each other .
that' s the secret to survival .
never go to war .
especially with yourself .
