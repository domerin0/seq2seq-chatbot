it' s not true at all .
no ...
it' s journalists , they have this romantic idea of self destruction .
lee wasn' t self destructive .
well ... he did everything to excess .
less than the friends he hung around with back then ... they' re all complete alcoholics .
it' s good they' re re releasing his records .
yes , i' m happy about it .
despite the stupid liner notes .
i think they would have made him laugh , too .
yes .
i wasn' t gone too long ?
no .
so what did you get up to ?
did you watch cartoons ?
yes .
what did you do when the cartoon was over ?
i read .
you read !
what' d you read ?
i read md geist .
i thought you read that already .
no , i meant the new one .
i have to tell you something .
we' re gonna have to stay in london a bit longer than i thought .
are we going to stay at the hotel ?
yes .
do you remember how i told you that the specialists had examined grandma rosemary because she had a very sore back ?
yes .
well they don' t know what it is that causes the pain .
so they have to keep doing these tests .
so she' s gonna stay in the hospital and we' re gonna stay together .
are we gonna live in the hotel ?
yeah .
the two of us gonna stay in the hotel .
is that okay with you ?
yes .
now , tomorrow you' il come with me and we' il go visit grandma rosemary at the hospital .
okay .
sorry , the other day
i was with the head of programming .
i know ... it' s the same old thing .
i detect a note of reproach .
not at all .
it' s just that i know you .
you' re angry about the past .
no .
i' m still angry with you .
you really didn' t treat me that nice .
we don' t have to see each other .
i can leave now if you like .
no , don' t .
if you act up , i won' t stay .
stay .
so sandrine says you' re moving back to paris ...
i can' t go back to london .
too many memories .
what are you going to do now ?
i wanted to discuss it with you .
a drink ?
the same thing ... a whiskey .
as i was saying i thought i' d talk to you .
i thought maybe you could help ...
maybe , but times have changed .
sure , but times seem to be treating you okay .
yes , because ...
i' m good at my job ... good at corporate politics .
but if i had a little freedom ...
no , please ... forget about it .
you' re busy but i wanted to thank you for the show .
it was great .
thank you .
that' s so nice of you !
see you soon , i hope .
see you soon .
lee didn' t leave you anything ?
we weren' t married .
we had a joint account .
almost empty .
and your son ?
if i want to see him i need to turn my life around .
meaning ?
i need a job , for example .
and to stop shooting up .
that' s history .
i doubt it .
i said that it' s history !
i was on methadone but i stopped taking it .
do you know how often i hear that in my office ?
i' ve known you long enough and i' ve heard all your lies .
i' ve changed .
people don' t change .
that' s your opinion , not mine .
sandrine said you were stoned out of your mind .
you can level with me .
i don' t care .
it' s your life .
she' s pretty , sandrine .
do you sleep together ?
no .
she dumped me two months ago .
do you still love her ?
two days ago i followed her all night long .
did she know ?
yes .
she pretended i didn' t exist .
she was with a woman her new lover .
i' ve known for a while .
i couldn' t care less .
this woman has a restaurant near beaubourg .
it' s doing okay .
not too pretty , but very maternal .
unlike me .
i did something incredibly stupid .
and it' s too late to yell at me .
sandrine stopped by to have me sign something .
i got her into the bathroom locked the door and left .
i swear !
it' s not funny !
you' re not a kid anymore .
you can' t do that !
i know .
pathetic .
is lrene here ?
come here .
come closer .
yes , i' d like a taxi .
thank you .
what did you tell her ?
that it' s over .
are you serious ?
dead serious .
you just killed her .
i doubt it .
but i really hope i did .
this way .
through the courtyard .
it' s lrene .
she' il call all night to apologize .
you want a whiskey ?
i do .
sure .
then i' il be going .
is it true you and lrene were lovers ?
it' s too much .
i' il get drunk .
so what ?
before lee , you were with lrene .
not with her .
but yes ...
we were lovers .
did lee know ?
sure he did .
sorry for all the questions .
no need to apologize .
it' s no secret .
emily ?
emily !
emily !
i got it .
it' s heavy .
i' il manage .
yann and henri are friends of jeff' s .
hi .
want to see your room ?
i thought you' d call last night .
i saw lrene .
any luck ?
no , a dead end .
i told you not to count on her .
i crossed that bitch off my list ages ago .
you can unpack .
you can stick the crates in the closet .
like it ?
it' s great .
the bathroom' s that way .
if jeff' s dog bothers you just hit him .
beat it !
are you two coming ?
we' re finishing something .
later .
later .
i told jeff i' d stop by rehearsals .
here are the keys .
for the house and for the gate .
you can always reach me on my cell .
make yourself at home , okay ?
see you later .
emily .
what' s wrong ?
want a painkiller ?
i took one .
i wish lee were here .
to take me in his arms .
to tell me it' il be okay .
i' m sick of being alone .
i keep screwing up .
why did he leave me all alone ?
hi .
i didn' t see you yesterday .
it was my day off .
that' s why you were here on sunday and i' il be here again next sunday ...
oh good .
i haven' t been to see mrs. hauser yet .
well , they' ve promised they' d do a scan today .
what did the doctor say ?
i don' t know , i have a bad feeling ...
are you sure the scan is today ?
that' s what they told me .
and that' s what they said yesterday and the day before ... same thing ...
listen , i don' t know all i can do is repeat what they tell me .
i wasn' t complaining .
i' m sorry .
it' s me i' m feeling tense ...
let me get it .
how are you doing with jay ?
fine , fine .
it' s the first time you' ve spent any time with him .
yes .
even with lee , i didn' t take much interest until he was ... until he was already a little grownup .
kids intimidate me .
why ?
because they understand everything . they read your thoughts they know what you' re going to say even before you say it .
so ... what conclusions has jay come to ?
he thinks that i' m shy , a bit awkward , pretty boring ... not that smart but i' m smarter than he thinks .
are you ?
yes ...
he takes coins from my pockets and he doesn' t think i notice ... but i do .
other than that , he wants to see his grandmother .
let' s wait until tomorrow .
i spoke to emily .
who ?
your daughter in law .
she lives in paris .
she says she' s off the drugs .
she' s getting a job ...
i think she' s having a hard time i don' t know , i feel sorry for her ...
albrecht .
yes .
i don' t want to talk about her .
of course , but she is jay' s mother ... and one day , we' re going to have to talk ...
one day , not now .
ronaldo demachy .
hi .
sorry about the wait .
i' il be frank .
i' m seeing you because lrene paolini insisted .
she' s someone i respect a lot .
i won' t waste your time .
i want things to be perfectly clear .
i think they are .
right .
we' re opening a boutique in the printemps department store .
you' il have certain responsibilities , but it' s a step above salesgirl .
i understand that .
it' s very hard work , and to be honest not very well paid .
i' ve thought it over and i want it .
do you know our line ?
of course .
we target active women with limited means but who expect quality .
not exactly your profile .
but the store attracts a lot of tourists ,
sure .
no problem .
many of them asian , so speaking several languages is a major asset .
come meet madame gregory .
she runs the show here .
she' s busy overseeing our new lingerie collection .
obviously you' il have to fit into our mold .
meaning ?
you can' t dress like you are now .
or like you did on your cable show .
it would look bad .
you saw the show ?
it was my generation .
it was a lot of fun .
it was before cable tv caught on .
it was for the happy few .
the cool set .
there' s madame gregory .
are you home ?
i' m going out soon .
how was it ?
awful .
it didn' t work out ?
yeah , it' il work out .
i don' t exactly have a choice .
i learned that in prison .
learned what ?
to adapt .
if i want to see jay i have to change my life .
even if the new life sucks .
it' s the life most people live .
yeah , but it' s grim .
being a junkie was better ?
i don' t know .
i honestly don' t .
you went shopping .
a little .
for jay .
he can sleep downstairs .
don' t bother .
i' il make room with me .
he' il be fine .
it' s no bother for a weekend .
exactly .
if i only have two days
i want him near me the whole time .
don' t get carried away .
what do you mean ?
what happens when he has to go ?
back to london .
then back to vancouver .
it' s far away .
i' m sorry to be harsh .
you' re right .
maybe it' s better if i don' t see him .
i don' t know .
why is albrecht coming ?
i wrote him to say i' m doing well that i found a job .
i guess he doesn' t believe me .
he' s checking .
are you up to the test ?
i' m trying to change ...
but i don' t know if i can take care of a child .
i want a coffee .
i' il meet you inside .
got any change ?
remember i told you about gloria ?
the girl you met in prison ?
she' s out .
i thought she was in for a while .
it turns out the case was dismissed .
she called last week .
she wants me to join her .
where ?
san francisco .
she found a label .
they like our demos .
be careful .
do you have a contract ?
she didn' t mention one .
is there any money in it ?
they' re willing to pay for sessions with a real producer .
what' s his name ?
david roback .
got a light ?
no .
he has a group called mazzy star .
excuse me , do you have a light ?
sorry for bothering .
thank you .
they did a few albums .
good stuff .
i remember mazzy star .
but he' s only free next week .
to record on monday i' d have to leave on sunday .
i' m not going .
i don' t know how to tell gloria .
she' il be disappointed .
tell her you' il come later .
it' s now or never .
and jay comes first .
if i go to san francisco i' il fuck everything up .
i' ve done enough of that .
i won' t do it again .
excuse me .
there you are ...
now , did you do what i said ?
did you set your stopwatch ?
oh yes .
good how long have we been in the tunnel ?
4 minutes 35 .
4minutes 35 .
you' re right .
what are we going to do in paris ?
i' ve already told you three times we' re going to see your mother .
do i have to see her , too ?
yes .
can' t you go by yourself ?
no .
coffee please .
you didn' t tell me , i was going to spend the week end with her .
she' s your mother .
she killed my dad .
no , she did not !
yes , she did .
grandma rosemary told me so .
jay , you know it was an accident .
no , it wasn' t .
he died because he took the drugs she gave him .
come on .
i have to talk to you .
your grandmother and i are old we won' t always be here .
what' s gonna happen when we' re gone ?
i haven' t finished timing .
stop .
she' s your mom .
she loves you and you have to get to know her .
i don' t love her and she doesn' t love me either .
you' re alone .
jay didn' t wanna come .
what do you mean , you promised me ...
no , i didn' t promise you anything i said i' d come to paris and we' d talk .
no , you said i have him all weekend .
if he doesn' t want to i can' t force him .
it' s not good for you either .
he doesn' t want to see me .
he doesn' t know you .
he hates me .
i don' t know he never talks about you .
i know but ...
if you' d told me earlier ...
i wouldn' t have gone my hopes so high .
i' m trying to do my best it' s not easy .
i know .
me too .
we have to stay in london .
maybe for a few weeks give him some time .
i' il talk to him ...
you can come over and see us .
i' m sorry i can' t do this let' s meet another time .
albrecht !
hello .
hello , a table for two .
smoking or no smoking ?
smoking .
step this way , please .
thank you .
jay is here , he' s with me in paris .
he' s at the hotel , it' s not far from here .
his grandmother she thinks we' re in scotland she doesn' t know he came with me here .
how is she doing ?
they' il do a little operation next week .
after that , it just depends on the tests .
she seems to think ...
well , to be honest , i can' t even mention your name in front of her .
because she thinks that i' m responsible for what happened to lee .
yes .
that and everything else , his decline .
how about you ?
i believe in forgiveness people change .
if they need to , they change .
but i don' t want to hurt rosemary .
if she thought i' d brought jay here for one second it would tear her apart
i called you back because what you wrote in your letter really moved me .
but you don' t trust me .
does that make any difference ?
i mean , emily , i' m old i won' t always be able to look after jay .
you mean ... by yourself ?
yeah , that' s it ... that' s exactly it .
without rosemary ...
so , have you started your new job ?
yeah i sell clothes for active women .
at printemps , it' s a department store but i get the weekends off .
printemps somehow i can' t imagine you .
it' s better than nothing for now .
you' il find something you' il love you' il find something else .
i hope so .
oh , you will .
wait for me i have to talk to him first .
if he doesn' t want to , then ...
no .
no .
no of course ...
of course .
i am completely in your hands .
if you choose to , you can run off with him .
you' re his mother .
you don' t risk much .
i won' t .
and you will bring him back by 3 : 40 train tomorrow afternoon ?
yes .
i' m sorry emily , i need you to give me your word .
you have my word .
okay .
have you been on a scooter before ?
no .
would you like to try ?
come on , you' il see ...
it' s really fun , come !
are you scared ?
no .
since you didn' t say anything i thought you were scared .
i' m not scared .
maybe you' re scared of me ?
no .
your granddad said you were scared of me ...
no .
i' m glad to hear it hold on tight !
let go !
come on .
when i was a kid i only liked tigers and monkeys .
do you like monkeys ?
depends which ones .
how about the gorillas ?
i have seen gorillas .
where ?
in canada at the vancouver zoo .
oh come here , look !
is it nice the vancouver zoo ?
much better than this one .
come on , look at the zebras
this one' s lame what' s it called again ?
it' s the vincennes zoo .
that' s the name of the town .
we' re not in paris ?
no .
in vancouver there are grizzly bears elks and beavers .
maybe they' ve got some here .
we can ask .
no .
i' ve seen enough of them in canada .
they' re everywhere .
once one tried to bite me .
one what ?
a beaver .
are they dangerous ?
no , they' re really dumb .
look , there' s a baby .
so what do you want to see now ?
i want to see a snow leopard with white spots .
a snow leopard , that' s a very rare animal .
i' m gonna ask the guy over there .
you wait for me here ?
okay .
thank you .
jay ...
jay !
jay !
jay !
do you think that' s funny ?
no .
me neither .
i don' t want to spend the weekend with you now .
why not ?
because you killed my dad .
is that what you think ?
i' m not the only one .
who else ?
everyone .
i didn' t kill your dad .
you gave him drugs that killed him .
that' s not true .
then why does everybody say you did ?
because they don' t know .
you' re a liar .
come on .
let' s just get out of here .
it was me who went and brought the drugs that night .
he tooks some , i took some ...
that' s the way it was always between us ...
what' s the difference who bought them ...
anything could have happened ...
it could have been lee losing me ...
and you know what ?
drugs are more complicated than what most people think they are ...
some people need them because they' re suffering because they don' t know how to live any other way ... your dad was like that ...
and me too ...
because you' re weak .
no , your dad wasn' t weak .
he did some really great work but it wasn' t easy for him ...
you have to be very strong to do that ...
you should be proud of him .
then how come he needed drugs ?
they gave us some really good times .
but afterwards , you always have to pay the price and it' s very high .
look at me i' m still paying .
you' re not on drugs anymore ?
i gave up mainly for you .
why for me ?
because otherwise i know i' d never seen you again .
hi sniff , that' s jay .
anyone home ?
elena' s gone out .
here' s the box .
thank you .
i' il show you upstairs our room ...
it' s on your left .
so this is the room elena lends us .
she is really nice .
you gonna meet her later .
you don' t have your own room ?
it was in london .
why don' t you live in london ?
too many memories .
memories of my dad ?
yes .
you don' t want to remember him ?
yes , but not for now it' s still too painful .
how about later ?
yeah ...
maybe later .
and how about you ?
do you like london ?
yes .
more than vancouver ?
yes .
albrecht and rosemary are nice but they' re old and sad .
because your father died .
because rosemary is going to die .
she told you that ?
yes .
i' m gonna make some hot chocolate .
do you want some ?
okay .
look over there there' s some dvds .
choose if there' s one you wanna to watch ...
go upthere .
hey , it' s gloria .
are you there ?
no ?
i' m in san francisco , at the triton hotel on grant street .
remember , i told you about it ...
please , please , please , call me back .
david put the sessions off 48 hours to give you one last chance to get here .
i don' t know what else to say .
i' il give you the number ...
just a minute it' s ...
can i watch this one ?
no way .
that' s not for kids .
are you going to san francisco ?
i don' t know ...
i don' t think so ...
that' s where i was born .
yes .
what' s san francisco like ?
it' s a beautiful city by the sea .
there' s a big bridge you must have seen it in photos , no ?
if you go , can i come too ?
try one of these , they' re really good .
are you sure there' s not another film that you' d want to watch ?
there must be something ...
oh look !
robbie le renne , have you seen that ?
you hurry up , alright ?
okay .
i wait here .
okay .
emily !
you' re bringing him back already ?
no , he forgot something .
what ?
his hat .
his hat ?
i thought he had it with him .
so how' s it going ?
very well .
has he adopted you yet ?
well ...
i forgot to take my magazine .
and your hat ...
but now you have it .
yes .
pull it down over your ears otherwise you' il get cold ...
i' ve get to talk to your mom , ok ?
let' s go inside ...
in you go .
what did he get from upstairs ?
his passport .
i thought so .
where' s he going ?
he wants to come to san francisco with me .
i got offered to record some songs there and it' s a chance that' s never gonna come back .
so you' re giving up ...
clothes for active women at printemps , yeah .
good ...
glad to hear it ...
thanks ...
come on ...
i think it' s brave of you ...
it' s easy to be brave when things are going well ...
but when life is more difficult it' s unusual ...
and special .
i' m sure that' s what lee would advise you to do .
i have a deal for you .
do i have a choice ?
of course you have a choice .
he' s your son .
you' re his mother .
rosemary is not going to live very long .
i want him to stay with her .
so she can see him now and then ...
so , you go to san francisco and then come join us in london afterwards ...
is that okay with you ?
of course ...
it' s going to be a very difficult time for me ... and for jay ...
he' s gonna need his mother ... to protect him ...
and i' il try and help rebuild a life , ... a new life if that' s at all possible ... for both of you ...
okay ?
go .
chris , stand by .
i think she' s ready , go ahead and roll it .
i saw her coming to me
you will leave here tonight
everybody is in ocean drinking wine from the bar
going home with the stars up in the sky
me
i am down in the light
there' s a rhythm
don' t ya know it
right here , for everything
there' s a lady
she' s a killer
silver mountain in her eye
going home with the stars up in the sky
me , i am down in the light
me , i am down in the light
emily , maybe we should take a break for a few minutes .
emily , i really liked it .
i think we should go on and do another song .
alright .
that was so great ...
you' re not tired ?
no , i' m fine .
ok , great .
