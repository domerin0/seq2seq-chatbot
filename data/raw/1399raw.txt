groups of unemployed workers , who have grown in number due to the tax reforms ... ... enacted by the former prime minister , are rioting all across the country .
and with the confusion among members of parliament sparked by the comments of ... ... finance minister takanashi during a recent parliament inquiry , there seems to be no compromise insight between the government and opposition .
hey .
what' il it be ?
give me three peanuts .
let' s see here ...
we' ve herded those clown bastards onto route 5 .
damn it , don' t scare me like that !
open the damn door quietly !
you wouldn' t be so jumpy if you didn' t have something to hide !
try selling some normal drinks sometime , huh ?
how about buying something for once ? !
this ain' t a hangout !
and drink that dog piss you sell ? !
twin ceramic rotor drives on each wheel ...
and these are ...
computer controlled anti lock brakes ...
200 horsepower at 12, 000 rpm ...
you wanna ride it , tetsuo ?
all right , let' s go !
that bike' s been customized just for me .
it' s too wild .
you couldn' t handle it .
i don' t see how you can ride something like that , man .
i could !
if you want one so bad , steal a big one for yourself .
unbelievable .
school kids these days ...

hey , waiter !
they ran into the alley !
after ' em !
this isn' t a game , you idiot !
shit ... !
that' s
this is car 375 .
we' ve got reports of biker gangs fighting near the intersection of highway 14 south !
request immediate assistance !
car 375 , en route to the scene !
it' s the cops !
what should we do ?
damn , and my motor coils were just getting warmed up ...
bastards ...
let' s go , tetsuo !
right !
damn !
a skirmish has broken out between student protesters ... ... and riot police assigned a security .
there appear to be some casualties .
furthermore
what the ?
what the hell' s going on ? !
move it , jerk !
i' m in a hurry !
what was that ? !
call the police !
repeal the tax reforms !
this area is off limits !

it' s dangerous !
something' s strange here ...

i' m sorry , let me through !
what' s the big idea ?
look !

who are they ?
excuse me .
hey !
don' t push !
excuse me .
hey !

there' s a kid with him !
run ...
hurry ...
go to ryu ...
ryu will help you now ...
hurry ...
get out of here ...
kei !
what are you doing ?
hurry !
he vanished ... !
he' s to the west .

tetsuo !
ryu !
ryu , where are you ?
kei !
no , that' s !
how you like that ? !
well ?
who is it ?
it' s not him !
it' s not tetsuo !
okay !
let' s go !
you little ...
what did you do ... ?
tetsuo !
hang on !
hey !
huh ?
what did you say ?
that kid ...
he' s hurt bad !
hey !
wait !
we gotta get him to a hospital !
he needs an ambulance !
we can' t move him !
w what the hell ? !
there' s no escape .
we' ve come for you .
we can' t survive on the outside .
come on , let' s go home .
it' s the army !
those are army helicopters !
move out !
down on your stomachs !
spread your arms and legs !
um ...
we' re just , uh ...
down on your stomachs !
spread your arms and legs !
ow ...
damn it , that hurts !
kai !
hey !
sir ?
who are they ?
they seem to be an ordinary bike gang , sir .
we' re going back .
ow !
hey , wait a minute !
my arms don' t bend that way , damn it !
load the wounded onto the helicopter !
tetsuo !
wait !
where are you taking him ?
kaneda !
what the hell ?
we didn' t do anything !
he' s heavy ... !
so you and your friends went out at night on your bikes to visit your dying mother , and a group of hooligans called the clowns picked a fight with you .
they hurt your friend , so you lost your temper , which is why eight clown members are now in the hospital .
that' s your story ?
she' s cute !
hey !
you can' t look at this !
and how' s your mother doing ? !
huh ?
oh .
luckily , she made it through the worst of it last night .
and i suppose she' s made it over the mountains on a bike by now ?
it couldn' t be these bozos .
you can tell that just by looking .
wait on that bench .
understand ?
how much longer are we gonna have to wait ?
okay !
the next five , come get in here !
so the army' s working with the police ... ... to hunt down anti government groups now , huh ?
wanna put up a fight , huh ?
he' s holding something !
bastard !
long live the freedom revolution !
he' s got a grenade !
crazy son of a bitch !
all right , that' s enough !
take him away !
we' il really teach him a lesson later .
you dumb bastard !
if you wanna die , just hang yourself or something !
hey !
you people can go .
we' ve contacted your school .
what ?
you son of a
hey , hold on a minute , pops !
pops " ? !
there was one more of us .
what ?
pardon me .
what' re you
this is her .
can she leave with us ?
who are you calling " pops , " you punk ?
ow !
look here , kid !
i' m only 25 !
i' m not even married !
so watch your mouth !
she can go with you !
call a doctor !
so i think the army was chasing that weird kid kaneda saw ...
i think i saw him , too .
and what about tetsuo ?
why the hell wouldn' t they tell us what hospital he' s in ?
what did you say ? !
i was just wondering if you wanted to grab some tea or something over there .
i figured we could have a nice , long talk about that " revolution " deal .
skirt chasers will try anything these days ...
you' il help anyone so long as it' s a girl , won' t you ?
no way !
i have high standards !
no way !
i have high standards !
it' s not their looks that count .
it' s their ...
i dunno , their sensitivity that makes me do it .
i suppose i owe you one .
thank you very much , uh ...
i' m kaneda .
nice to meet you .
see you around , kaneda .
you' re leaving already ?
don' t be like that !
hey , come on !
i did save you and all !
at least tell me your name , you bitch !
i' il try talking with them for the time being , but it' s risky .
if they think you' re trying to avoid taking responsibility , it' il blow up in your face .
i can' t believe that there' s a mole on the executive council .
even if that' s true ...
that isn' t important .
what' s important is diplomacy and political maneuvering , which you seem to despise .
i never studied them in school , you see .
i n any case , at the next executive council meeting , your poor management of this last incident will be called into question .
there ' s a phone call for the colonel .
you should put your affairs in order .
it' s me .
this way , colonel .
i' m terribly sorry to call you here , but there' s something you really must see .
please observe .
it' s the special pattern from that young boy .
it doesn' t resemble any i' ve seen so far , and i' ve never seen a developmental speed or confiiguration like this .
it may have begun with the shock of contact with number 26 , or possibly ...
have you finished running a comparison with akira' s pattern ?
i' il superimpose it over this one .
this projection was constructed using mixed data , so a comparison is difficult , but i believe this boy' s pattern is the key to solving ... ... the riddle of akira' s pattern growth process .
all right .
continue .
very well , sir .
thank you .
i' m sure he' il turn out to be a worthy addition to the numbers .
it may be rough on him , but i thought we might try starting him off with level 7 capsules .
is it safe ?
leave everything to me .
that' s not what i meant !
i' m asking that if he turns out to have power like akira' s like you said , will we be able to control it ?
well , that' s
can i leave this to you ?
well , if we use the latest examination equipment to collect even more data ... ... and do a multifaceted analysis , then surely ...
maybe we shouldn' t touch that power .
the power of god ?
a ... ki ... ra ...
but we have to .
we have to touch it and control it .
if it looks like it' s too much for us to handle , terminate him at once !
there can be no hesitation !
very well , colonel .
this school is your last chance !
if trash like you that can' t keep up with the academic ability of regular students ...
if trash like you that can' t keep up with the academic ability of regular students ... ... and can' t adapt to living in a group screw up here , it' s the end of the road !
even if you' re under 15 , if you get more than 50 penalty points on your record , you' re sent to the regular courts !
bite me !
don' t mess with us , you bald goat !
aren' t any of you listening ?
you lost me halfway through !
discipline !
discipline !
discipline !
ow !
discipline !
discipline !
discipline !
dismissed !
thank you very much , sir !
you bastard !
you and me are gonna go at it someday , jack !
we' re gonna remember this !
i hope you rot and die !
you sick bastard !
shit ...
yamagata !
what happened to your cheek ?
shut the hell up .
let me guess , jaws from p. e. ?
they say you fought the clowns on a highway in the old city !
yeah .
why don' t you just wipe ' em out ?
those guys are so gross !
and last night ...
there were demonstrators , cops , and even the damn army !
and that idiot tetsuo had an accident , too .
what happened to tetsuo ?
he' s in the hospital , i guess , but we don' t know where .
the idiot was trying to show off .
that idiot ...
what , you mean tetsuo ?
shut up !
i' ve had enough of your damn flirting !
what' s gotten into you ? !
tetsuo ?
it' s time for your medication .
doctor !
there' s a problem !
i can' t .
the dorm mother throws a fit if you go out before 10 .
yeah , the one with the face like a goat .
that old bag' s such a pain ...
she' s always yammering on and on and on .
tomorrow at three ?
sure , that' d be okay .
hey , what happened to that girl a while back ?
i don' t like her much .
her personality just gets on my nerves .
kaori ...
tetsuo !
everyone' s been worried about you !
they thought you might be dead .
when i woke up , i was on an operating table or something .
and that examination ...
it' s like ... they were messing around inside my head .
i don' t want to go back there .
let' s run away ...
where ?
someplace .
someplace far away .
what' s your problem ?
that' s mine !
i wanna get laid !
hey !
today' s independent study !
hey !
today' s independent study !
say what ?
what about my burning desire to study ? !
say what ?
what about my burning desire to study ? !
drag his butt in here !
kaneda !
your bike !
my bike ?
look !
tetsuo !
are you sure this is okay ?
shut up !
just keep quiet and hang on !
huh ?
what' s wrong ?
shit !
oh , no ...
we' re stopping ...
we stopped .
oh , okay .
the engine can' t drop below 5, 000 even when you' re changing gears .
oh , okay .
the engine can' t drop below 5, 000 even when you' re changing gears .
my butt hurts .
okay , i get it ...
look , bikes !
is that kaneda and ... ?
it' s not them !
kaori !
any sign of him ?
kuwata and the others went to look around kisarazu .
all that' s left now is the industrial area !
okay , let' s go !
we owe you for the other night !
shut up !
kaori !
what did they do , kaori ? !
don' t !
if you so much as scratch that bike , i' m gonna kill you !
run !
don' t let ' em get away !
wait !
tetsuo !
that' s enough , tetsuo !
are you trying to kill him ?
yes !
i' m gonna kill him !
i' il split his damn head open !
knock it off ! .
this happened because you took my bike for a joyride .
enough , already !
shut up !
don' t order me around !
we were worried about you .
why do you always have to come and save me ?
i could' ve handled it myself ! .
i admit i got beat up that one time , but i won' t always be on the receiving end !
understand ? !
tetsuo ...
shut up !
stay away from me !
hey , wait !
where are you going ?
leave me alone !
akira !
tetsuo !
what' s wrong ?
akira !
i don' t know who that is !
tetsuo , are you ...
hey !
this is strange .
i' m getting a blue pattern on scope # 3 !
oh , no !
retrieve the subject !
hurry !
what' re you doing to my friend ? !
what' s with you ?
you just come back from a funeral ?
tetsuo !
kaneda !
shit ...
wait !
hey , kaneda ...
i see we have some youngsters doing their thing in spite of the tight checkpoints .
that just means that they' re stupid , don' t it ?
this is boring .
hey , let' s go home .
but it' s still early !
yeah , but without their bikes they' re just skirt chasers out of water .
you mean " fish " !
come on , let' s go .
let' s toss these fish back !
hey , kaneda , what' re we gonna do ?
what the ?
look !
that' s ...
here we go again ...
let' s get out of here before we get involved again .
huh ?
kaneda ?
hey !
this area is being cordoned off due to a terrorist bombing .
those who wish to get through , line up in single file , present your id and go through the checkpoint .
get in .
what' s wrong ?
hurry .
i' il be right behind you .
you know the rendezvous point , right ?
be careful .
you too , ryu .
stop !
stop , damn it !
she' s got a gun !
okay , that' s far enough !
drop the gun !
drop it now !
stop !
i think it came from over here !
there were two shots !
no , three !
it' s just up ahead !
hey .
let' s get out of here .
come on !
kaneda !
so , what' s the matter ?
try telling me about it .
i had a dream .
a dream ?
the city will be covered by a dark shadow and start to crumble .
lots of people died ... ... and we met akira again .
akira ? !
the city will crumble , and so many people will die ...
when ? !
when will it happen , kiyoko ? !
you mustn' t let that boy go .
his power , it ...
what did she mean ? !
well , there' s nothing physically wrong with her .
her medication is normal , too .
there' s no sign of any abnormalities in her ecg or eeg , either .
i think what number 25 said was her precognitive power at work .
this must be presented to the supreme executive council for inquiry , but ...
do you believe her ?
i have no doubts regarding number 25' s abilities .
we have all sorts of data that substantiate her abilities .
what about you , colonel ?
my job isn' t to believe or disbelieve .
it' s to act or not to act .
here , sir .
cold gear , colonel .
please put it on .
you , too , doctor .
the other day , a young researcher asked me something .
he wondered if their power was the form the next stage of human evolution was taking , and perhaps that we' il all be able to control it some day .
scientists are a bunch of romantics .
military men always consider the risks first .
it' s taken thirty long years .
we' ve come so far from the rubble .
we can' t just trade one for the other .
i' ve always thought that you hated this city , colonel .
the passion to build has cooled and the joy of reconstruction forgotten , and now it' s just a garbage heap made up of hedonistic fools .
so you' re trying to save the city , then .
it' s how a soldier thinks .
a scientist wouldn' t understand .
colonel , we' re here .
this way , sir .
room 1 0 , 1 48 degrees kelvin .
fluctuation tolerance range , check .
room 9 , 118 degrees kelvin .
fluctuation tolerance , check .
emergency power generator , check .
open it .
yes , sir .
uh ...
go to the control room !
yes sir !
room 1 is at 0 . 0005 degrees kelvin .
it' s within tolerances .
no abnormalities detected in any of the rooms ' ... ... dewar walls or in the defense system .
no abnormal atmospheric concentrations or reactions recorded .
all systems nominal , then ?
look at what they abandoned in their panic .
they were afraid !
they were too scared , so they hid it away from the public .
they forgot all shame and honor ... ... and cast off the civilization and science we had created , and shut the lid of the pandora' s box they themselves had opened .
ryu !
hey , we' re still young .
i think we can start over .
i' il go with you to the police .
ryu !
come on , turn yourself in !
that was the first time you ever killed somebody , right ?
ryu !
anyway , once you' ve purified your body and soul ,
let' s go out for tea or something .
don' t kick yourself over it , okay ?
what' s done is done .
the guy' s dead .
who' re you ? !
ryu !
you' re okay !
kei , is that you ?
ryu !
who' s this ?
who , me ?
well , i guess saying i' m kei' s boyfriend might be stretching it a bit .
but we haven' t gotten physical or anything yet , understand ?
are you a spy ? !
no !
liar !
is he really okay ?
all i know for sure is that he' s not a spy .
ow ...
sneak into their lab ? !
are you serious ?
don' t you remember the fiasco with that kid ? !
last minute orders .
besides , the plan' s already in place .
the lab passes they issue once a week ...
they' re from mr. nezu ?
what' s the objective ?
detailed data on the new subject .
new subject ?
yes .
last week , on the night we tried to abduct the subject called number 26 , a boy who was in an accident on an old city highway was brought to the lab .
looks like he' s a student at a vocational training school , but he' s now their new subject for human experimentation .
ow !
ow !
what' s the big idea ? !
you !
he heard us !
let' s kill him !
ryu !
w wait a minute !
listen to me !
listen to what i have to say !
he saved me !
twice !
maybe it was just to get close to us .
the guy who was in that accident in the old city is a friend of mine !
i know it' s hard to believe , but it' s the truth !
i was there when it happened !
don' t they say the only foolish questions are unasked ones ?
huh ?
they don' t ?
that' s an intriguing story .
will you be taking the boy with you ?
he knows the subject , and i think we can use him as a decoy if necessary .
neo tokyo is going to change .
i n all respects , this city is saturated .
it' s like an overripe fruit .
and within it is a new seed .
we only need to wait for the wind which will make it fall .
the wind called akira !
ryu , look !
what is it ?
we aren' t the ones who will change it , but rather , those citizens who hope for akira will .
that which is called science perverts providence !
that which is called progress encourages extravagance !
that which is called civilization devastates the spirit of man !
that which is called civilization devastates the spirit of man !
the time of a tonement is upon us !
the time of his awakening is nigh !
the time of lord akira' s awakening draws near !
are your hearts prepared ? !
are your hearts prepared ? !
holding meetings here is prohibited !
break up this illegal gathering !
terrorist activities carried out by ... ... anti government elements have skyrocketed this month .
the army , riot police , and even traffiic police have been fully mobilized .
the overtime costs alone have used up the public safety budget .
and then there' s the abduction of number 26 !
isn' t their existence supposed to be highest of state secrets ?
no one' s ever heard of " peace and order " here in neo tokyo , then ?
and then there' s this request of yours ... ... for further funding because of subject number 25' s prediction .
you must be joking !
we parliament members have been begging the public to bear with us ... ... while we straighten out the former prime minister' s historic tax reform blunders , so where , exactly , are we supposed to get that kind of money ? !
you' ve spent a fortune , and all we have to show for it is that grotesque kindergarten !
the olympics are next year .
the postwar period is over .
how much longer will you keep spending money on some ghost ? !
i always said that we should' ve put that money into the welfare program !
shut up , old man !
what ? !
that power is starting to walk around free as we speak .
unless we control it now , we' il lose everything !
who do you think you' re talking to , youngster ?
it was your lack of policy that started this mess in the first place !
there' s still no proof that the last world war was caused by akira !
won' t you even try to understand anything at all ... ... unless an akira disaster actually happens ? !
has anyone actually seen this " akira " ?
wasn' t akira number 25 ?
no , i think he was number 2 1 ...
the colonel has lost sight of his duty as a soldier .
i' ve had reports that anti government elements are using ... ... this " akira " madness of yours as an excuse to whip up their terrorist fervor !
no !
that' s untrue !
then what about that akira world renewal movement ?
wouldn' t you say that information' s being leaked ?
world renewal movement ?
end of the world , more like !
aren' t you just using akira as camouflage to cover up your misconduct ?
what are you getting at ?
colonel , we can no longer leave the peace ... ... of neo tokyo to your sole discretion .
right !
you are to be put before an inquiry committee .
i agree !
excuse me !
colonel !
colonel , where are you
wait !
this discussion isn' t over yet !
explain yourself ! .
are you trying to insult the supreme executive council ? !
colonel ... !
wait , colonel !
w water ...
hey , wait a minute ...
isn' t that cable replacement scheduled for next week ?
the cable they ordered came in early .
besides , i' m going on vacation at the end of the week .
besides , i' m going on vacation at the end of the week .
i' ve brought some workers with me , too .
i could take it back , but the work' s gonna be done sooner or later .
okay , let' s go .
what the ?
milk ?
stay away !
blood !
i' m scared !
jerk !
w who the hell are they ?
room 887 , tetsuo shima ...
a problem with the automatic lock ?
hey !
you can' t just walk off from your room !
come on , let' s go back .
what the hell happened ?
what a mess !
there are 58 blocks with circuits that the computer won' t display .
of those , nearly 40 are concentrated on underground levels 7 and 8 .
that' s probably the place .
the central wiring shaft should be up ahead .
we should be able to use it to go straight to the sublevels .
be careful , it' s deeper in the middle .
what a stink !
quiet !
what ?
i said it stinks because it stinks !
is your nose busted ?
hurry up and stay quiet !
damn !
hide !
huh ?
where ?
what' re you doing , you idiot ? !
they left ?
looks like they' ve beefed up security .
must be that siren we heard .
what should we do ?
scout around some ?
no .
are you okay ?
let' s keep going .
i want to check out their security at the very least .
all right .
we' ve been spotted !
run !
shit !
don' t !
don' t shoot !
shimazaki !
shit !
forget about him !
run !
what the hell is that ?
here it comes !
forget it !
you can' t do any good !
die !
this is unit 304 , shaft h !
have encountered intruders and am engaging !
request backup !
here it comes !
kei !
where' s that gun ? !
damn it ... !
kaneda !
kei , this way !
hurry !
kaneda , hurry !
kaneda !
the brakes !
where are the brakes ? !
that' s not it ?
this is the central wiring shaft !
it' s gotta be this one , then !
okay , i' m getting the hang of this !
ask the colonel for clearance to fire !
turn that up !
there must be some mistake .
that boy looks like the patient they admitted to the lab .
the boy , the subject named tetsuo shima , broke out of his room .
i think he' s headed for the baby room .
tetsuo ? !
he is an extremely dangerous state !
don' t let him through !
i repeat , do not let him through !
what the ?
it' s no use hiding .
we have no choice , then .
use your guns !
we can' t let him go any farther , no matter what it takes !
fire !
so , here you are ...
stop it !
how long are you gonna keep playing around ? !
where' d the other one go ?
why , you ...
die !
takashi !
what the hell is going on ?
am i dreaming or something ?
i never knew i had powers like this !
damn it , which way should i go ? !
straight .
straight ahead ...
huh ?
there' s a freight elevator .
we can take it to sublevel 8 .
good , you' re all together .
you thought you could kill me ?
you tried to mess with me ...
i' m gonna kill you !
that was you
takashi !
attack him together !
o okay .
you little twerps !
that' s enough !
all of you !
who the hell are you ? !
what' s the matter ?
does your head hurt , tetsuo shima ?
your power isn' t fully matured .
if you push yourself , you might do irreparable damage . just do as we tell you .
what the hell did you people do to my head ? !
calm yourself , tetsuo shima !
he can' t control it .
what ? !
she said that big people like you should never use the power like that .
she says something horrible will happen .
mind your own business .
what ?
more powerful than me ?
he ' s the one !
he' s been popping in and out of my head lately !
where is he ? !
where' s this " akira " ? !
what ? !
kiyoko said that you' il awaken akira .
if that happens , no one will be able to stop him .
so before that can happen , we have to stop you .
impossible !
akira' s already
wh ere is h e ? !
stop it !
shut up !
threat level to facility integrity has passed level 7 ..
enacting disaster protocols .

you don' t like the way i talk ?
does it make you mad ?
well , what' re you gonna do about it ? !

he flew away .
how can he have so much power ... ?
how could this have happened ?
is anyone here ?
he' s developed so much power in such a short time ...
find him !
find tetsuo !
find him !
go after him !
kaneda !
hang on , kaneda !
hurry up !
get that rubble cleared !
he went to where akira is .
what ?
you' re all safe !
he' s heading for the facility below the olympic construction site .
how did tetsuo find out about that ? !
you mean he' s gone outside ?
damn it !
we' il follow him !
prepare for pursuit !
yes sir !
he' s heading west !
he' s heading for the olympic construction site !
tell them to beef up their security !
you ... !
set up checkpoints on all ...
according to the defense team , intruders were encountered in the wiring shaft .
two disguised as workers resisted and were shot , and the rest are at large .
he has to be stopped before his powers mature ...
your objective is the boy tetsuo shima .
if we are unable to capture him , you will lure him out to the old city and attack .
request assistance from the eastern district battalion .
yes sir !
tell them there isn' t a moment to lose !
i' ve been waiting for you , colonel .
who the hell are you ? !
i' m here to inform you of the supreme executive council' s decision .
at 2400 hours today , the colonel is hereby stripped of his command and rank , and will be placed under arrest .
what ? !
please come with us .
you expect me to hand neo tokyo over to those fools at a time like this ?
shoot him .
yes sir !
what ?
w wait !
enough !
open your eyes and look at the big picture !
we can' t dance to the tune of corrupt politicians and capitalists !
don' t you understand ? !
it' s pointless to fight anymore !
announce a state of emergency , arrest all members of the executive council ... ... and remove them from the chain of command !
we' re going after tetsuo !
urgent message to all district battalion commanders !
hey , what' s up ?
you by yourself ?
weren' t you in an accident or something ?
everybody' s been worried .
so , you feeling better ?
gimme some ... capsules .
hey , are you sure about that ?
you don' t look so hot . just hand ' em over !
all right , if you say so .
but with all those demonstrations and terrorist attacks lately , things are rough .
they' re hard to come by , so they' re pretty expensive .
tetsuo' s run off , kaneda' s disappeared ...
i guess the team' s fiinished .
and the checkpoints are so strict , even the clowns are staying put .
what' s wrong ?
what' s wrong ?
he' s dead !
what ? !
what the ?
tetsuo ?
what are you doing here ?
you want some , too ?
what are you talking about , damn it ? !
what the hell happened here ? !
the barkeep' s dead !
a fish out of water dies , huh ?
you are tetsuo ...
aren' t you ?
kaneda sends his regards .
you saw kaneda ? !
he' s probably dead by now ...
you did this , tetsuo ?
so anyway ...
where' s kaneda' s bike ?
tetsuo !
i don' t need a piece of junk like that anymore ...
you son of a ...
yamagata !
shit ...
he went to where akira is ?
that' s what that girl said .
the army , you , and ryu are all looking for this " akira " guy , so that' s why you' re chasing after tetsuo .
it has something to do with that power of tetsuo' s , right ?
what the hell is this " akira " thing you keep talking about ?
ryu told me about it once .
he said that akira is absolute energy .
absolute energy ?
humans do all kinds of things during their lifetime , right ?
discovering things , building things ...
things like houses , motorcycles , bridges , cities , and rockets ...
all that knowledge and energy ...
where do you suppose it comes from ?
humans were like monkeys once , right ?
and before that , like reptiles and fish .
and before that , plankton and amoebas .
even creatures like those have incredible energy inside them .
because of genes , i guess .
and even before that , maybe there were genes in the water and air .
even in space dust , too , i bet .
if that' s true , what memories are hidden in it ?
the beginning of the universe , maybe .
or maybe even before that .
hey , what' s the matter ?
are you okay ?
did you get hit on the head back there ?
maybe everyone has those memories .
what if there were some mistake and the progression went wrong , and something like an amoeba were given power like a human' s ?
that' s what akira is ?
amoebas don' t build houses and bridges .
they just devour all the food around them .
that' s what tetsuo' s doing ?
you' re saying he has that kind of energy ? !
a long time ago , there were people who tried to control that power .
at the government' s request , you see .
they failed , and it triggered the fall of tokyo .
that power is still too much for
what ? !
the door' s unlocked .
huh ?
this has got to be a trap .
go back , then .
no , we ought to find out how much of it is a trap ...
by the way , what' s with you and that ryu guy ?
what do you mean ?
you' re always together .
that' s none of your business !
what i' m saying is , he doesn' t know about us , does he ?
us " ?
hey , wait a minute !
what' s that supposed to mean ?
do you think this will work ?
it can' t be helped .
at this point , our only option is to use her .
the fact that she turned up right under our noses says as much , i think .
i guess ...
have arrived at ward 13 , east ginza intersection .
over .
northern district battalion has not responded to mobilization request .
special search team to hq !
special search team to hq !
we ' re at the haruki ya snack barnear the highway interchange in ward 8 .
it doesn' t look like a bomb explosion , so we think it was him .
it was almost certainly the work of the subject that escaped from the lab .
yes , sir !
yes , sir !
understood !
kaneda !
what ? !
yamagata' s dead ? !
something seemed strange about him from the second i saw him .
he was wearing what looked like a white hospital gown .
it was like he was a different person .
yamagata asked him if he was really tetsuo .
and then ...
yamagata , he ...
we' ve always been together .
i' ve known everything about him since we were in the children' s home .
he was a klutz , and everybody made him cry .
oh , right ...
he wanted to know where your bike was .
my bike ... ?
what' re you gonna do ?
i' m gonna send yamagata his bike .
you dumb bastard !
kaneda !
kei !
what' s wrong ?
you !
you were there that night ...
wait !
kei !
they disappeared !
you were the ones who changed tetsuo too , weren' t you ?
akira' s power exists within everyone .
who' s there ? !
but when that power is awakened , you must choose how to use it , even if you weren' t prepared for it .
and he has made his choice .
tetsuo is our newest companion .
we' re partly to blame for his actions .
why did you take kei , then ? !
we want her to help us .
you can' t just use people like that !
bring kei back !
tetsuo' s our friend !
if anyone' s gonna kill him , it should be us !
hey !
damn it !
mr. omi and the other executives have been arrested by the coup ... ?
y yes , that' s right .
the house guards are fighting them right now .
yes .
i' d like to have a helicopter waiting at west haneda .
yes .
that damned colonel ...
i can' t believe he' s taken up arms .
i underestimated him .
hold them here !
damn !
mr. nezu ...
r ryu ? !
is that you ?
i' m sorry , sir ...
the mission was a failure .
what are you doing here ? !
i' ve told you , you can' t be seen here !
all of my men ...
they' ve all been killed .
y you sold me out , didn' t you , you bastard ? !
what ?
you can' t be
kei ...
i got fresh fish in here , buddy !
i' m gonna get compensated for ' em , right ?
please , i have to catch a flight at noon !
what ?
7th avenue is just ahead !
it intersects this road 100 meters from here !
prepare for battle !
right , we' ve spotted the subject .
what ?
attack ? !
but he' s just a ...
we' re attacking a boy ? !
look !
there he is !
impossible !
is this for real ?
firing preparations complete .
damn it !
fire !
akira !
it' s lord akira !
it' s the advent of lord akira !
that' s not him !
don' t be fooled !
that' s not lord akira !
shut up !
long live lord akira !
fire !
huh ?
what' s wrong ?
neo tokyo broadcasting is exclusively covering the news ... ... in spite of martial law in the name of freedom of the press ! ... in spite of martial law in the name of freedom of the press !
what in the world is happening here in neo tokyo ?
what you see here seems to be fires caused by tank cannons .
but who is this young boy ?
is he fighting the coup forces all by himself ?
viewers , the army has just illegall ordered us to land !
freedom of thepress is now in jeopardy !
what happened ?
were they cut off ?
the bridge !
he' s heading for the bridge !
let' s go see !
are you really going alone ?
he wants this , doesn' t he ?
we should call the gang together .
hey !
i wouldn' t want to keep him waiting .
hey , kaneda !
wait !
half seem to be anti government demonstrators .
the rest are ...
well , they' re more like some crazy cult than onlookers .
they' re following after the subject , and more and more keep coming .
oh , flames of purity , raze this corrupt city !
consume our unclean hearts !
fear not !
your bodies will be purifiied in the flames !
ready !
fire !
set the switch to hold for three seconds and converge your beams !
aim !
fire !
watch this !
look out !
let' s get out of here !
help me !
ground forces !
ground forces , come in !
report !
what is the subject' s status ? !
ground forces !
call the doctor .
we have confirmation of his recent movements and are in pursuit .
his present position is ...
let' s see ...
coordinates 99871 by 4332 .
that' s about2 km south of the olympics construction site in the old city .
what ? !
what was that ?
look !
that' s near the toll booth that' s being guarded by the 2nd platoon .
wha ?
huh ?
please turn around !
this area' s off limits to civilians !
what ?
that' s the subject ? !
s stop !
stop , damn it !
nice place you have here .
wait , you were with kaneda .
you shouldn' t use your power this way .
what ?
i n the end , you won' t be able to control it .
the kids ...
you' re those brats , aren' t you ? !
okay , then ... !
what the ?
it' s not safe here , colonel !
well , what' re you gonna do ?
open up !
what the hell ?
that' s akira , tetsuo !
that' s the " akira " you wanted to meet .
there' s your messiah !
after his transcendental awakening , his body was subjected to every test known to science .
and that' s what was left of it .
the scientists back then were unable to solve the mystery , so they decided to entrust their collected data and test samples ... ... to future generations by preserving them in a frozen capsule .
sol ...
we' il use sol !
sir ?
akira is already dead !
well ?
are you satisfied now , tetsuo ?
so come back with us !
like hell !
contact the central defense center ... ... and tell them to patch us through to sol' s control circuits !
yes sir !
hey , watch it !
damn it , move !
get out of the way !
what is this , science class ?
what' s wrong ?
have some trouble ?
yeah , but i already took care of it .
if you were here earlier , you could' ve watched the show .
you had me worried again .
i figured you' d be standing here , sobbing like a little baby .
kaneda , you' ve always been a pain in the ass .
you' ve been telling me what to do ever since we were kids .
you always treat me like a kid .
you always show up and start bossing me around !
and now you' re a boss , too ...
of this pile of rubble .
kaneda !
that' s mister kaneda to you , punk !
die !
tetsuo !
son of a ...
kei !
oh , hell !
let' s do it !
got him !
huh ?
the battery ? !
what' s the matter , kaneda ?
god damn it !
this ain' t fair , tetsuo !
fight with your bare hands !
oh , this is funny ...
feeling frustrated , kaneda ?
now do you understand how it feels ?
what' s this light ?
well , did you hit him ?
we' re too close to the impact point .
there' s too much electrical interference .
prepare a second volley !
hey !
kaneda !
tetsuo !
shit ...
huh ?
what the ?
correcting for tracking system error .
t minus 20 to energy alteration .
fire extinguishers !
are you okay ?
hurry !
hurry !
what happened ?
what' s going on ?
kaneda !
kai !
kei !
kaneda !
kaneda !
get on !
get on ?
where ?
hurry !
hurry !
what' s that ?
they say it' s sol .
magnificent ...
when tetsuo' s power reaches its peak ?
that' s when we do it .
but will it work ?
the future doesn' t proceed along a single course .
there ought to be a future we can choose .
what' s tetsuo' s status ?
ah .
colonel ...
we set up a camera in the stadium a while ago .
we have him under observation .
colonel , you must take a look at this data !
we' re still analyzing the energy given off by the subject , but ...
it' s magnificent .
absolutely magnificent .
this is clearly a proton collapse .
we' re also detecting a fair number of what we believe to be unknown particles .
if we can put this into a theoretical framework , physics
no , science ...
humanity itself could touch the fundamental truths of the universe !
oh .
that' s ...
we still haven' t finished making our adjustments .
uh , colonel !
t that' s ... !
you bastard !
what did i tell you ? !
b but , colonel !
i couldn' t throw away such a magnificent subject !
shut up !
shit !
it' s on fire !
the battery !
the battery !
my bike !
it' s burning up !
hey , what' s a bike or two ?
what ?
then there' s nothing wrong with using yours , right ?
you heard that ?
yeah , i did !
hey , your bike' s still on fire .
tetsuo ?
tetsuo , why does everyone call you " akira " ?
he never existed in the first place .
they didn' t care who it was .
just so long as he destroyed things .
your arm !
it doesn' t look like much , but it works pretty good .
what' s wrong ?
are you okay ?
it' s nothing !
tetsuo ...
shut up !
just go away !
medicine ...
what' s wrong , tetsuo ?
are you in pain ?
go back to the lab and get me some of that medicine !
did you hear that , doctor ?
yes , colonel .
well ?
can you see any signs of it ?
i' m not entirely certain , but it seems that the power that had been held back by the drugs is breaking free .
he may not be able to control power that has awakened so suddenly .
at any rate , he' s in an extremely dangerous condition !
if you don' t go back to the lab and receive proper treatment , you may die .
you want me to enroll in that kindergarten and live happily ever after ?
take my medicine every day and shrivel up like those kids ? !
kaori ...
kaori ...
please ...
i need that medicine ...
no ... !
tetsuo !
tetsuo !
tetsuo
kaneda ? !
huh ?
son of a ...
you kids ...
what are you doing here ?
you never learn , do you ?
tetsuo !
takashi ...
akira ...
kaneda ... ?
h help me ... !
kaori ...
help me ... !
help me !
stop it !
kaori ?
kaori !
kaori !
tetsuo ?
is that you , tetsuo ? !
kaori !
kaori' s gonna die !
what ? !
what did you say ? !
my body' s not doing what i tell it to !
my power' s acting on its own ... !
kaori !
kaori' s dying !
kaneda , help me !
stop , tetsuo !
stop it !
kaori' s pain is coming into me ... !
tetsuo !
kaneda !
run away !
tetsuo !
kiyoko !
takashi !
masaru !
get away from here !
come on !
i can' t believe it .
it' s as if
kiyoko !
taka
hi , akira .
th this is ...
but that' s oh , no !
w where am i ?
hurry !
get into the tunnel !
you' il be safe in there .
kiyoko !
where are you ?
tetsuo !
kaneda !
hang on !
if you don' t get out of here now , you' il
out of the way !
tetsuo !
don' t go !
no , takashi !
if you went in now , you' d be trapped , too .
but none of this is his fault !
takashi !
takashi !
if we went in , we wouldn' t be strong enough to come back out .
but if the three of us worked together , maybe we could at least save that boy .
you' re right .
together , the three of us could ...
oh , man ... !
we should get out of here .
hey !
kaneda ...
look , you' re not revving your engine enough .
when you go into a corner , lean like you' re trying to kill yourself .
watch !
what' re you doing ?
cornering , man .
got it , tetsuo ... ?
look , there' s another one !
another transfer student ?
he was abandoned .
you can see it in his face .
are ...
are these your dreams , tetsuo ?
wait !
this is akira ... ?
yes .
we called him .
to have him take tetsuo away .
take him away ?
take him where ?
it' s too much for tetsuo .
and for us .
and for akira .
it' s too big for us as we are now .
but someday , we ' il also be able to ....
you see , it' s already begun .
your friend' s
my friend ?
kei !
you mean kei , don' t you ?
tetsuo ...
this is yours , right ?
they' re always like that with the new kids .
you came today , right ?
they beat me up , too .
but the truth is , those guys are wimps .
i' m tetsuo .
tetsuo shima .
to tell you the truth , i just got here myself .
i' m
kaneda ...
kaneda ?
kaneda !
kei ?
w what' s happening ?
what in the world is happening ?
b but this isn' t ...
if this is correct , it' s almost as if ...
is this the birth of a universe ? !
kei !
what happened ?
it' s disappearing ... !
it' s disappearing !
kaneda !
tetsuo ...
kaneda ...
thanks .
you called to me , right ?
i heard you .
kaneda , don' t tell me you' re ...
what about tetsuo ?
he left .
so did those three kids .
akira , too .
kaneda , back then , you ...
kaneda !
you' re alive ? !
i thought you were in there for sure !
tetsuo ...
what happened to tetsuo ?
is he dead ? !
i' m not so sure .
but he' s probably ...
but someday , we ' il also be able to ...
you see , it' s already begun .
i am ...
tetsuo .
