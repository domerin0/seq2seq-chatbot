you have beautiful eyes .
get off my face .
wow , you and me , we make a great team .
i mean .
what' d you say we just head south together ?

yeah , hey jump up on my back and relax your whole way .

the changing seasons , migration instincts ?

i guess not , bye .
okay , then thanks for the help .
i can take it from here .
hey , you over grown weasel .
wait till we get down there .
ohohou .
that south thing is way overrated .
the heat , the crowd .
who needs any ?
isn' t this great ?
you and me , two bachelors knockin ' about in the wild .
no , you just want a bodyguard so you don' t become somebody' s side dish .
you' re very shrewd mammal .
can you lead the way , mr. big guy ?
didn' t get the name .
manfred .
manfred ?
yuck .
how about manny the moody mammoth ?
or manny the melancholy ...
manny the ...
stop following me .
ok , so you' ve got issues .
look , you won' t even know i' m here .
i' il just zip the lip when i say ...
look at the cute little baby , diego .
isn' t it nice if he' il be joining us for breakfast ?
it wouldn' t be breakfast without him .
especially since his daddy wiped out half our pack and wears our skin to keep warm .
an eye for an eye .
don' t you think ?
let' s show that human what happens when he messes with sabers .
alert the troops .
we attack at dawn .
and diego , bring me that baby .
alive .
if i' m gonna enjoy my revenge , i want it to be fresh .
phew .
i' m wiped out .
that' s your shelter ?
hey .
you' re a big guy .
you got a lot of wood .
i' m a little guy .
you' ve got half a stick .
yeah , but with my little stick , and my highly evolved brain ...
i shall create fire .
fascinating .
we' il see if brains triumph over brawn tonight .
now , won' t we ?
hey , i think i saw spark .
any chance i can squeeze in there with you manny ?
old pal ?
isn' t there someone else you can annoy ?
friends ?
family ?
poisonous reptiles ?
my family abandoned me .
they just kinda migrated without me .
you should see what they did last year .
you know , i mean .
they woke up early and finely tied my hands and feet . and they gagged me with a fieldmouse , barricaded the cave door , and covered their tracks , went through water so i' d lose their scent , and ... who needs ' em , anyway ?
so what about you ?
you' ve family ?
okay , you' re tired , i see .
well , we' il talk more tomorrow in the morning .
au , au , a , a , au , au .
manfred ?
manfred .
could you scooch over a drop ?
come on , nobody falls asleep that fast .
manny !
there' s diego , fall back !
where' s the baby ?
i' ve lost it over the falls .
you lost it ?
i want that baby , diego .
i' il get it .
you' d better .
unless you want to serve yourself as the replacement .
we' il go up to half peak .
meet us there .
it' d better be alive .
can we trust you with that , diego ?
let' s go !
and then she picked this hair off my shoulder and says , look ...
if you' re gonna have an extra mating dance , at least pick a female with the same color pelt , right ?
and i thought , wow , she' s gonna go praying mantis on me .
i mean , you know what i' m saying ?
if you find a mate in life , you should be loyal .
in your case , grateful .
get away from me .
well , i think mating for life is stupid .
i mean there' s plenty of sid to go around .
manny ?
look at that .
he' s okay .
she' s gone .
hey , hey , hey manny , are you forgetting something ?
no .
but you just saved him .
yeah , but i' m still trying to get rid of the last thing i saved .
you can' t leave him here .
look , there' s smoke .
that' s his herd right up the hill .
we should return him .
let' s get something straight here .
okay ?
there' s no " we " .
there never was a " we " .
in fact , without me , there wouldn' t even be a " you " !
just up the hill .
listen very carefully .
i' m not g o i n g .
fine .
be a jerk .
i' il take care of him .
go .
yeah , that' s good .
you' il take care ...
you can' t even take care of yourself .
this i gotta see .
i' il return you .
we don' t need that meany weeny mammoth , do we ?
no , we don' t .
you' re the embarrassment of the nature , do you know that ?
that is cake .
i' m fine .
i' m fine !
i' m gonna die .
that pink thing is mine .
no , actually that pink thing belongs to us .
us ?
you two are a bit of an odd couple .
there is no " us " .
i see .
can' t have one of your own , so you want to adopt .
look , i' m sorry to interrupt this snack .
but we gotta go .
the baby , please .
i was returning him to his herd .
oh , yeah .
nice try , bucktooth .
you' re calling me a liar ?
i didn' t say that .
you were thinking it .
i don' t like this cat .
he reads minds .
name is diego , friend .
manfred .
and i' m not your friend .
fine , manfred .
if you' re looking for the humans , you' re wasting your time .
they left this morning .
thanks for the advice .
now beat this .
all right , i' il help you bring it to its herd .
but promise me that you leave me alone after that .
okay , okay , deal .
what' s your problem ?
you' re my problem .
but i think you' re stressed .
that' s why you eat so much .
i mean .
it' s hard to get fat on a vegan diet .
i' m not fat .
it' s all that fur .
it makes me look puffy .
all right , you have fat hair .
but when you' re ready to talk , i' m here .
i don' t know .
just drop it on the ledge .
shouldn' t we make sure they found him ?
good idea .
no , no , no !
wait .
wait .
don' t spear me !
ohhhm .
this is a problem .
now what ?
oh .
that' s perfect .
i told you they were gone .
look who it is .
don' t you have some poor defenseless animals to disembowel ?
they couldn' t be far .
i mean .
they went this way ?
or this way ?
you don' t know much about tracking , do you ?
hey , i' m a sloth .
i see a tree , either leaf , that' s my tracking .
you didn' t miss them by much .
it' s still green .
they headed north 2 hours ago .
it' s still green .
they headed north 2 hours ago .
you don' t need this aggravation .
give me the baby .
i can track humans a lot faster than you can .
and you' re just a good citizen helping out , right ?
i just know where the humans are going .
glacier pass .
everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side .
well , unless you know how to track , you' ve never gonna reach them before the pass closes up with snow .
which should be like , tomorrow .
so you can give that baby to me or go get lost in the blizzard .
it' s your choice .
here' s your little bundle of joy .
we' il return it to the humans .
oooh .
the big bad tigey wigey get left behind .
poor tigey wigey ...
sid , tigey wigey is gonna lead the way .
manny , can i talk to you for a second ?
no .
the sooner we find the humans , the sooner i get rid of mr. stinky drool face .
and the baby too .
you won' t always have jumbo around to protect you .
and when that day comes , i suggest you watch your back .
cause i' il be chewing on it .
hey , human tracker , up front where i can see you .
help me .
you gotta make it stop .
i can' t take it anymore !
i' ve eaten things that didn' t complain this much .
he won' t stop squirming .
you' re holding it wrong .
watch its head !
just put it down !
jeez , ' pick him up , put him down , make him ... '
its nose' s dry .
that means something is wrong with it .
someone should lick it .
just in case .
i' il do it .
hey , he' s wearing one of those baby thingies .
so ?
so if it poops , where does it go ?
humans are disgusting .
okay , you .
check for poop .
hey .
why am i the poop checker ?
because returning him home was your idea .
because you' re small and insignificant .
and because i' il pummel you if you don' t .
why else ?
now , sid !
yuhh .
yuck .
yuhh .
i mean , my goodness .
all right , look out , look out .
coming through .
watch out !
stop waving that thing around !
oh , i' m gonna slip !
it' s clean !

hey , do that again .
he likes it .
it' s makin ' me feel better too .
here , you hold it .
turn him towards me .
where is the baby ?

where is the baby ?
there it is !
stop it !
you' re scaring him !
i bet he' s hungry .
how about some milk ?
uhh .

not you , the baby .
well i ain' t exactly lactating right now , pal .
you' re a little low on the food chain to ... aren' t you ?
enough !
food !
i don' t know , but i' ve been told ...
i don' t know , but i' ve been told ...
end of the world be mighty cold ...
prepare for the ice age !
protect the dodo way of life !
survivals separate the dodos from the beasts .
ice age ?
i' ve heard of these crackpots .
intruders !
don' t fall in .
if you do , you' il definitely ...
intruders !
intru ...
uaaaa .
uuuuuuuh .
burn and die .
hey , can we have our melon back ?
junior is hungry and ...
no way !
this is our private stockpile for the ice age .
subarctic temperatures will force us underground for a billion years .
so you' ve got three melons ?
if you weren' t smart enough to plan ahead , then doom on you .
doom on you !
doom on you !
get away from me !
oh !
no !
retrieve the melon !
taikwondoodos !
taikwondoodos !

i need him .
why ?
a good looking guy like you ?
no .
you say that , but you don' t mean it .
no , seriously , look at you .

we have a very cruel sense of humour .
hey .
don' t let me cramp your style .
oh .

without pinky .
manny , manny , i need him .

that' s what mammoths supposed to do .
sid .
find a she mmoth , have the little baby mammoth ...
sid !
what ?
shut up !
well .
would you look at that .
the tiger actually did it .
there' s half peak .
next stop .
glacier pass .
how could i ever have doubted you ?
did you hear that little fella ?
you are almost home ?
my feet are sweating .
do we have to get a news flash every time your body does something ?
don' t pay attention .
just ignore him
seriously , my feet are really hot ...
tell me that was your stomach .
i am sure it was just thunder .
from under .. , ground ?
come on keep up with me .
i would if you were moving .
wow .
i wish i could jump like that .
wish granted .
come on move faster .
have you noticed the river of lava ?
hold pinky !
manny !!!
manny , manny , manny are you ok ?
come on , come on say something .
anything !
what .
what ?
i can' t hear you .
you are standing on my trunk .
are you ok ?
why did you do that ?
you could have die trying to save me .
that' s what you do in a herd ...
we look out for each other .
well ... thanks .
i don' t now how about you guys , but ... we' re the weirdest herd i' ve ever seen .
i can' t wait to get my claws in that mammoth .
no one touches the mammoth until i get that baby .
first , i' m gonna slice its hind quarters into sections .
i' m on to put the white meat in one pile and dark in ano ...
hey .
knock it off .
i am starving .
next , the shoulders .
occasionally tough , but extremely juicy .
i told you to knock it off !
save your energy !
mammoths don' t go down easy .
there is only one way to do it .
first you have to force it into a corner .
cut off his retreat .
and when you three have it trapped ...
i' il go for the throat .
guys .
we gotta get this kid out of the wind .
how much further ?
3 miles .
i' m beat .
we' il get there in the morning .
what' re you doing ?
i' m putting sloth on the map .
hey .
why don' t you make it realistic and draw him lying down ?
and make him rounder .
perfect .
i forgot how to laugh .
i am a genius .
from now one you' il have to refer to me as ...
sid , lord of the flame .
hey , lord of the flame , your tail' s on fire .
thank you .
from now one i' m gonna call you diego .
lord you' ve touched me and you are dead .
i am just kidding you little knuckle head .
hey lovebirds .
look at this .
i don' t believe it .
come here , you little biped .
come here , you little wormy worm .
come to uncle sid .
no no this way , this way .
no . no , no .
go to him .
go to him .
ok ...
good job .
keep practising .
look at that .
our little guy is growing up .
come on .
sleep time .
lumpy .
look at that big pushover .
you know diego , i' ve never had a friend who' d risk his life for me .
yeah , manny' s ... is a good guy .
yeah he is .
well , good night
all right .
let' s get you all cleaned up .

ok .
let me just clean that up .
that looks good and little bit here ...
you clean up nice little fellow .
i think he start to look like me .
hey diego , what do you say ?
maybe we shouldn' t do this .
why not ?
because if we save him , he' il grow up to be a hunter .
and who do you think he' il hunt ?
maybe because we save him he won' t hunt us .
au !
yeh , maybe he' il grow fur and a long skinny neck and call you mamma !
what is your problem ?
nothing .
lets go , it' s freezing my tail off .
hey diego you' ve frozen back there .
get down .
what ?
shhh !
get down and follow me .
hey , hey !
what' s going on ?
at the bottom of half peak ... there is an ambush waiting for you .
what ?
what do you mean ambush .

it was my job , i was supposed to get the baby but then ...
you brought us home for dinner !!!
that' s it , you' re out of the herd .
i am sorry .
no you are not .
not yet .
listen , i can help you .
stay close sid .
we can fight our way out .
you can' t .
pack' s too strong .
you have to trust me !

why in the world would we trust you ?
because i am your only chance .
hello ladies !
hey look who decided to show up .
diego .
i was beginning to worry about you .
no need to worry .
in about 2 minutes you' il be satisfying your taste ... for revenge .
very nice !
i see the sloth !
and he' s got the baby !
don' t give away your positions until we see the mammoth .
he' s the one we have to surprise .
you wanna maul something .
don' t you think ?
