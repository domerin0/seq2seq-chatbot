thanks .
is it okay if i smoke ?
sure .
my matches are all wet .
you got a lighter ?
yeah , it' s here somewhere .
it' s my wife' s car .
there we are .
i remember once ... ... going on a school trip to the top of the empire state building .
when i looked down at the people on the street ... ... they looked like ants .
i pulled out a penny and some of us talked about what would happen ... ... if i dropped it from up there and it landed on somebody' s head .
of course , i never crossed that line and actually dropped the penny .
i don' t think early grayce even knew there was a line to cross .
it' s about the mind of a serial killer and culpability .
whoever can' t distinguish right from wrong is like a child .
by law , he should be treated like a child .
not imprisoned or executed .
there you go again .
next you' il lay it all at the altar of misfiring synapses ... ... amok biochemicals and horrendous childhoods .
it' s true .
most of these poor people suffer from chemical brain imbalances .
is that enough tequila ?
no .
the answer is research and treatment under hospital conditions .
not the electric chair .
great , brian .
unless it' s your mother they find in the refrigerator .
but executing the killer wouldn' t bring my mother back .
thank god .
oh , everybody' s a joker .
it would sure make you feel better .
no , actually , it wouldn' t .
the bottom line is , these people are evil , plain and simple .
how about a bowl of chili ?
a hot one .
be right there !
antichrist will be a woman ... ... in a man' s body ... ... with seven heads and seven tails .
make that to go .
the antichrist ... ... will be a woman ... ... in a man' s body .
seven heads and seven tails .
antichrist will be a woman ... ... in a man' s body .
seven heads and seven tails .
i always knew i' d be a writer .
but there' s a difference between an article and a book .
i know .
i wrote an article .
everything i wanted to know about serial killers fit on four pages .
brian , what are we doing here ?
research .
come on , look at this .
you' il get some great photos in here .
this is where her nightmares began .
her father worked the night shift here .
most nights he' d take her with him .
she was 1 1 years old .
of course , the bastard knew ... ... nobody could hear her screams over the noise of the machines .
the article got me a book deal , a little cash up front .
but between the rent and the convertible , the advance was gone .
i owed a book , and i was stuck .
all i knew about serial killers i learned at a university library .
and the only thing i knew for certain ... ... was that people didn' t kill each other in libraries .
she murdered her first victim here .
they found him stuffed in the corner .
they found her second victim ... ... over there .
can you imagine the rage and pain she felt returning here ?
the victim returns to the scene of the crime .
and becomes the criminal .
where did everybody go ?
i didn' t take that long .
size seven .
that' s right , ain' t it ?
super size seven .
oh , early , you' re a specialist .
happy birthday , adele .
oh , thank you , honey .
these are beautiful .
this reminds me of cinderella when the prince gave her his glass slipper .
except these ones are red and they ain' t see through .
and there' s two of them .
that my chili ?
oh , honey .
happy birthday to me .
thank you .
tonight turned out to be interesting .
oh , those fascinating friends of yours and their stimulating conversation .
no , the warehouse .
i' m not that stoned .
oh , the warehouse .
actually , yeah , it was interesting .
it was definitely the highlight of the evening .
just being there where it all happened ... ... i could almost ...
take your shirt off .
yes , ma' am .
come here .
early !
what ?
i' il be waiting for you when you get back .
put your titty back up .
wait , i forgot !
mr. diebold stopped by yesterday .
if we don' t give him his money by the end of the month ... ... he' il kick us the f u c k out of here .
he cussed at you ?
you gonna talk to him ?
well ...
shut up !
he comes back here , don' t you open that door .
well , suppose he hears me inside ?
i picked up some chinese .
did you hear from the gallery ?
you got your slides back ?
what did they say ?
you know , same story , different day .
they' re idiots .
too graphic .
too overt .
not suitable for mass consumption .
i forget which .
you don' t want to be suitable for mass consumption .
i know .
it' s just ...
who cares anyway , right ?
not me .
christ , i' m dying here .
why can' t we just get the hell out of here ?
why can' t we just go to california ?
why not ?
just like that ?
yeah , just like that .
yeah .
what the hell did i know about california ?
for some people , it was still a place of hopes and dreams .
a chance to start over .
the idea was if you could just get there , everything would be okay .
and if it wasn' t okay there ... ... then it probably wasn' t gonna be okay anywhere .
adele , whose car is that out front ?
she' s not here .
shit .
well , look who stopped by .
i ain' t supposed to be at the parole office till tomorrow , 2 : 00 .
you' re supposed to notify me when you lose your job .
yeah .
i stopped by the mirror factory today .
you left quite a mess behind .
well , that wasn' t my fault .
it' s a dangerous area and they treat me like shit .
nobody ever has treated you right , have they ?
your daddy was picking on you when he threw you out of the house ... ... for stealing the tires off his truck .
the police .
way out of line ... ... when they kept you from beating that bartender half to death .
you know ... ... i bet the lord will be picking on you come judgment day .
now hold on there !
i ain' t got nothing against god , see ?
it' s just people he let ...
get out of there !
what are you looking for ?
that girlfriend of yours ... ... not much for housekeeping , is she ?
well , i was thinking about moving anyhows .
maybe down to texas .
get a job on one of them rigs .
what are you talking about ?
well ...
you know you can' t leave the state .
just a thought .
what you can do is get a job .
you be at this address ... ... 3 : 00 sharp .
what is it ?
janitor' s job .
well , don' t want to be no janitor .
i don' t give two shits what you want and what you don' t want .
i' m telling you to be there .
or you' il be having dinner with the sheriff .
you understand me , boy ?
you ought to try putting a bag over your head for that cough .
works every time .
you peg armed piece of shit .
she came back to the warehouse that her father molested her in .
why ?
because this place is the catalyst .
she needed to relive her nightmares before she could kill those men .
the victim ...
oh , hey , sleeping beauty .
i didn' t have the heart to wake you .
thanks .
oh , my head .
what are you doing ?
i sat down with your photos ... which are wonderful .
thank you . ... and my tapes and i started writing .
how' s it going ?
it' s the best stuff i' ve ever done .
and i think i know why .
why ?
because for the first time i understood her as a human being .
i was walking where she walked , where she killed .
i was in her skin .
looking through her eyes .
i think we got a book here .
with your pictures and my writing , it' s a book .
on the warehouse murders ?
no , on the most infamous murders in american history .
we' il go where they lived and where they killed .
you take the pictures , i' il write the text .
what are you talking about ?
about this !
we can go through tennessee .
we can drop through arkansas ... ... wherever the hell arkansas is .
there it is .
then we can drop down into texas ... ... and from there , it' s a straight shot into ...
california !
california .
and we don' t stop till we hit the fucking ocean .
thank you .
we don' t have the money but we' il figure it out .
we' il figure it out .
hold it a minute , boy !
shit !
you' il settle that rent here and now !
i' m tired of your bullshit !
i want my money !
dipshit .
son of a bitch !
come back !
you tell him i want you both out of here by sunday ... ... or i' il call the police .
elvis , get the fuck off of him !
the rideshare was my idea .
i thought if a student wanted to go to california ... ... they' d help pay for the gas .
carrie wasn' t crazy about the idea ... ... but the lincoln only got eight miles a gallon .
they say the whole thing ...
will slide into the ocean .
i heard .
looking for somebody to take turns driving and share expenses ... ... on a week long , cross country tour of historic murder sites " ?
you' ve got to be kidding .
brian , who in their right mind would want to do that ?
i would .
like i said ...
hey , good luck on that thesis .
don' t know where the personal office is at , do you ?
the personnel office is first door on the left .
what , down there ?
stinking bitch .
shit .
early ?
how you doing , mama ?
fine .
boy , i' m tired .
dinner ready yet ?
almost .
well , let me know .
early ?
yeah ?
will you tell me more about california ?
yeah , i guess so .
let' s see .
for one thing ... ... people think faster out there on account of all that warm weather .
cold weather makes people stupid .
that' s a fact .
i guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here .
it sure does .
you know what else ?
what ?
you never have to buy no fruit .
it' s on the trees everywhere you turn .
and they ain' t got speed limits .
i hear your first month' s rent is free .
state law .
i' m thinking till we get settled , we' il move from month to month .
how would that be with you , mama ?
what will we do out there ?
by god , the first thing we' il do is get a six pack of lucky lager ... ... and we' il climb up to that famous hollywood sign ... ... and we' il howl at the moon .
yeah .
just like that .
i heard there ain' t nothing on that moon ... ... except some little golf balls that the astronauts left behind .
no , that ain' t right .
that' s bullshit .
the government' s sending people there .
just don' t want us to know .
now , get !
well , let me know when you' re finished .
shit .
what was he like over the phone ?
he was real polite .
he kept calling me " sir .
i like that .
i bet you do .
you should try it once in a while .
i don' t know .
this is really weird .
we should have met them first .
beggars can' t be choosers .
they were the only ones to answer the note .
oh , god .
please don' t let them be as boring as brian' s friends .
anything but that .
early , we shouldn' t be doing this .
now , you know you ain' t even allowed to be leaving the state .
and these people are strangers ... ... and what kind of people stop at places ... ... where other people got murdered ?
what if these people are dangerous ?
they ain' t .
they' re writers .
honey .
early grayce .
you settle things with mr. diebold ?
yeah , i did .
left him with the car .
we' re all straight now .
what is that ?
that' s lucy .
that' s mine !
what kind of cuckoo brain carries a cactus in her purse ?
i don' t know .
straighten up .
you' ve got to be kidding .
they look like okies .
jesus , they look kind of weird .
they don' t have five bucks .
you let me do the talking .
let' s keep going .
lighten up .
how many times you gonna say that ?
as many as it takes .
lighten up .
early ?
mr. kessler ?
hi , i' m brian kessler .
nice to meet you .
you must be adele .
uh huh , that' s adele .
nice to meet you .
hi .
can i help you with your luggage ?
oh , yeah .
i' il get these .
hi , i' m adele .
hi , i' m carrie .
i like your hair .
oh , thanks .
because it' s short .
oh , yeah .
well ... ... thanks .
carrie was right .
if you looked up " poor white trash " in the dictionary ... ... a picture of early and adele would be there .
but if i was gonna be a good writer , i' d have to ignore the clichs ... ... and look at life through my own eyes .
so , early .
what do you do ?
well , i do some work at the ...
well , i did some work at the mirror factory .
know what , brian ?
one night when we was staying up late ... ... we was talking about how much bad luck he must have ... ... from all those mirrors he broke .
and i swear we came to 449 years ... ... that it would take for him to work it all off .
and he' d have to , after he died ... ... he' il have to keep coming back to earth ... ... over and over and over again .
karma .
yeah , karma .
what ?
karma .
you know ... ... when you do something bad to someone and fate pays you back by ... ... something bad happening to you .
is that french ?
we can stop if you and adele haven' t had breakfast .
well , it' s like this .
i don' t eat breakfast .
it' s because of what he read in this book once .
that folks needing breakfast is a myth or something .
and it was put out by the cereal people .
jesus christ !
who are you ?
i' m his parole officer .
right .
talked to you on the phone .
what the hell happened ?
they say it' s a torch job .
that sound like your boy ?
could be .
where do i find him ?
i don' t know .
crazy son of a bitch was talking about moving to texas .
without his car ?
what about the owner of the house ... ... mr. john diebold ?
know where he is ?
i don' t know .
i tell you , he won' t be happy when he sees this .
jesus christ !
early seemed harmless .
primitive but harmless .
of course , the fact was ... ... he' d killed his landlord less than an hour before we met him .
he was even wearing the guy' s ring .
who knows what he did with the finger .
here you go , mama .
oh , thank you , honey .
look what i got .
i got a camera .
who gets ... ... the water ?
here you go , bri .
thanks .
i got bags of chips and some jerky if you want .
just in case .
what' s the difference between a killer and one of us ?
what is it they had or didn' t have that separated them from us ?
the novaks are long gone ... ... but the fence they hired michael zeruba to put up ... ... is still here .
the novaks ...
hey , you two .
come on , show your love .
the novaks embraced the young drifter as one of their own .
the neighbors said ... ... he was a quiet young man , often seen pushing the children on the swing set .
everything was fine until the novaks ran out of work for michael to do ... ... and had to ask him to leave .
how does a man get to the point ... ... where he can kill another human being in cold blood ?
early , could you move out of the way , please ?
the first to die ... ... was the 9 year old daughter .
hi , i' m brian kessler .
what' s your name ?
pa ?
pa , where are you ?
pa , there' s somebody at the door who wants to see you .
what ?
who is it ?
i don' t know .
good afternoon , sir .
i' m sorry to wake you .
my name is brian kessler .
i' m a writer .
i' m working on a book on the most famous murders in american history .
i' m sure you' re aware that this is the novak farm .
i was wondering if my girlfriend , carrie ... ... could come in and take a few pictures ... ... and i' il just tape some notes ... ... and we' il be out in five minutes .
just a few minutes .
i could walk around , get a feel for it .
goddamn ghouls .
we drove all day to get here .
i' d be out in five minutes .
five minutes !
brian , come on .
just forget about it .
come on .
at the time i was angry mr. baxter slammed the door in my face .
but it was just his way of forgetting ... ... of pretending that nothing terrible had ever happened there .
i guess it' s only natural to try and forget the bad things that happen .
you never really do , though .
well , we' ve come 480 miles so far .
not bad for a day' s haul , huh ?
pretty good , bud .
you got any family or friends in california , early ?
no .
you do ?
no , i don' t .
do you have any friends or family in california , carrie ?
what ?
no .
well , that' s okay .
at least we all got each other , right ?
i mean ... ... that' s something .
mama used to say that when you have people around you ... ... it' s better that you' re not alone .
check .
because when you' re alone , it' s hard to develop your personality .
and with more people around you , it helps ... ... because friends are really important and ...
thank you .
thanks , bud .
that' s ...
we' il get the next one .
we gotta hit the sack .
let' s go , mama .
have sweet dreams .
good night , adele .
good night , early .
that' s funny .
i didn' t know you were so prejudiced .
because i object to having somebody take off their shoe ... ... and scratch their foot while i' m eating ... ... l' m prejudiced ?
he can' t help the way he was raised .
i feel sorry for him .
you feel sorry for him .
that' s so sweet .
obviously , you didn' t get a whiff of that sock .
bitch , bitch , bitch .
thirty bucks for a motel .
for what ?
lumpy mattress , crummy tv and a crapper ?
don' t think so !
honey , sing me a song .
not now .
i' m busy , mama .
just stay put .
please .
okay .
if you don' t sing it , i' m gonna sing it myself .
honey ?
when we get to california , will you take me to that chinese restaurant ... ... where all them footprints are out in front ?
only if they let me put mine down too .
pretty smooth , how they stiffed us on dinner .
he didn' t stiff us .
he paid for the gas .
remember ?
brian , i am telling you , i am telling you .
they' re almost broke and we are gonna end up paying for the two of them .
and don' t change the subject .
it' s my favorite subject , though .
oh , my god .
good morning .
morning , early .
breakfast ?
no , i don' t eat breakfast .
never do .
sir .
we don' t have a liquor license , so i' m afraid you' il have to ...
that' s okay .
i got plenty more where this one come from .
morning .
morning , adele .
you cut your hair .
early cut it .
he said it makes me look more pretty .
and i think he' s right because ... ... he' s right .
nice job , early .
you like to order some breakfast ?
no , i won' t be having breakfast this morning , thank you .
want some of this ?
finish .
thanks .
what you reading ?
sex art in the american culture .
no , i never read that one .
i can' t wait to get on the road .
i love that convertible .
yeah , it' s great .
because ... ... i like wind , brian .
so do i.
you want me to get your stuff ?
no , thanks , early .
i can manage .
i meant to say luggage , ma' am .
i got them .
hi , honey .
mama .
when you dream ... ... there are no rules .
people can fly .
anything can happen .
sometimes , there' s a moment as you' re waking ... ... when you become aware of the real world around you ... ... but you' re still dreaming .
you may think you can fly , but you better not try it .
serial killers live their whole lives in that place .
somewhere between dreams and reality .
guess it' s your turn to pay , early .
hey , move it !
stupid son of a bitch .
you know , i used to smoke before i met early .
but he broke me of that .
broke you ?
yeah , because early , he don' t think ... ... that women should smoke or drink or cuss .
so you know what i do ?
i spell all my cuss words .
s. " ouch .
s h. " ouch !
s h l t !
but you don' t do any of those other things .
no .
i mean , i better not .
he whips you ?
no !
no , no .
only when i deserve it .
you were in there a long time .
yeah .
i took a dump .
you don' t want to go in .
it' s wall to wall stink .
just gonna go wash my hands .
ain' t got no sink .
no sink ?
nope .
damnedest thing i ever seen .
let' s go .
how about i drive , bud ?
no , mama , get in the back . $28 . 35 , sir .
how much ? $28 . 35 .
hope i got that .
make it an even 30 .
thank you , sir .
yeah .
when you first meet people , all you see are the differences between you .
but as time passes , you start noticing the similarities .
i guess that' s how all friendships begin .
okay , so you first .
you put down a card , and then i put down a card .
and then when they match up ... ... and it' s the same card ... ... then you go " snap " and i take it .
and i take the cards that' s there and ...
like that .
snap .
i thought you said you never played this before .
i haven' t .
i really haven' t .
i' m a fast learner , i guess .
i was reading in your deal how they never caught that black doler killer .
black dahlia .
yeah .
they didn' t .
well , i was wondering how come .
see what i' m getting at ?
it' s like ...
well , some people think he just stopped killing ... ... disappeared back into society .
that' s dandy , but i want to know what a smart fellow like yourself thinks .
i always thought it was a serial killer .
anybody who took that much time and care bisecting a human being ...
bisecting ?
you know , he cut them in two .
he hacked them up ?
two pieces , yeah .
in half .
anybody who did that must' ve enjoyed it ... ... and he would' ve done it again until somebody stopped him .
that' s good .
that' s a good theory , bri .
you want to hear mine ?
sure .
okay .
ain' t you gonna record it ?
early grayce' s black dahlia theory .
june 23rd .
okay .
now , i' m betting he' s still alive .
real old , living in a trailer park or something somewhere .
but he' s alive , see ?
now , he' s thinking about what he done .
going over it , over and over it , in his head every night ... ... figuring he' s smart for getting away with it .
that' s possible .
hey , you shoot pool ?
come on , bud .
designated driver .
minnesota fats .
don' t forget your key .
why did i open my big mouth ?
please come home soon .
let' s go !
jesus , bud , you damn near swallowed her !
why didn' t you go with them , adele ?
because ... ... you know how early feels about women drinking .
so how did you and early meet , anyways ?
i was hitchhiking this one day ... ... and early stopped .
and i walked up to look in the window ... ... and i looked in .
and early' s face , he was down like that ... ... because he was serious .
and then he ...
you getting in ? " and ...
and then he looked up .
and that' s when i saw his eyes .
and , i swear , carrie , he has the eyes of an angel .
and then , i just ...
i ended up moving in his trailer with him ... ... because i thought it' d be kind of neat .
but ...
you know what ?
i was thinking that ...
what if me , you , and brian and early ... ... all moved into a house together in california ?
wouldn' t that be fun ?
well , i mean ...
well , we' il see what happens .
you never know .
okay .
do you want me to fix your hair for you ?
yes .
because ... ... i don' t really like it ... ... that much .
come on , then .
okay .
it doesn' t look that bad ... ... but i think we should fix it .
i' m betting we' re gonna find us some doors around here .
yeah , the doors out front , on the street .
not " doors .
huh ?
doors , bud .
openings to other dimensions .
you see , i read , bud .
and i' m telling you , if a man knows what he' s doing ... ... he can transport himself to anywhere in this goddamn universe .
didn' t know that , did you ?
no , i didn' t .
i should tell you i' m not much of a pool player .
oh , it ain' t hard .
i can teach you .
really ?
yeah .
spot you a few balls first game too .
you' re not gonna hustle me , are you ?
how much money you got ?
what' s that ?
that' s a portfolio of my work .
that' s what that is .
your pictures ?
can i look at them ?
yep .
go right ahead .
oh , my lord !
did you take this one ?
i took all of those .
yeah , that one' s me .
no , it isn' t !
hold still , you .
oh , i' m sorry .
oh , my god , carrie .
if early ever saw me in a picture like that ... ... l' d be black and blue for a week .
you shouldn' t let him do that to you .
you think early' s mean to me ?
well , he' s not .
he may punch me once in a while ... ... but he' s not mean .
when i was 1 3 ...
... there were these three boys .
and they raped me ... ... in the back of this truck and ...
and ... ... they hurt me so bad ... ... that i was in the hospital for , like , four months .
and i feel safe with early because ... ... most of the time , he treats me really nice .
and ... ... i know that he' d never ...
he would never let anything like that ever happen to me again .
i like my hair .
you did a really good job , carrie .
it' s really professional .
hey , marlene !
come here , baby .
why don' t you and me get together tonight and sweat it up some ?
fuck off , t. j.
hey !
there you go .
that' il be five bucks .
wait .
wait a minute .
these aren' t lucky lager .
we ordered lucky lager .
take a look around you .
if you see something lucky around here , you let me know .
why don' t you tell me what you think is so funny ?
what ?
you think i' m funny ?
no .
what would a jizz gargling cum drunk fairy like you do ... ... with a pretty girl like that ?
what are you talking about , man ?
just relax .
hit him .
because it' s coming .
what' s that ?
this your boyfriend ?
no , he' s not my boyfriend .
why don' t you cool it , man ?
hey , asshole !
this ain' t lucky lager .
break it up !
wasn' t that guy' s fault .
t. j. started it .
dipshit !
rack ' em up !
because your pink replaces your red
my ma was a beautician .
really ?
yeah , she likes pink a lot .
you should' ve seen her face .
she was mad when she first found out i was with early ... ... on account of him just getting out of jail and all .
she hasn' t talked to me in over a year now .
i wish she' d call me , carrie .
early' s been in jail ?
uh huh .
what for ?
for carrying a gun .
and resisting arrest .
it' s a really interesting story , actually .
he put up a fight with the policeman ... ... and they struggled ... ... because he didn' t want to be arrested .
i' d have done the same thing .
why aren' t you laughing now ?
i don' t know .
i just don' t think ... ... that carrying guns and resisting arrest is very funny .
well ... ... l' m gonna go back to my hotel room now , carrie .
i had a really great time with you .
i just think i had too many beers .
and i wasn' t even supposed to be drinking in the first place .
adele , you don' t have to go .
i didn' t mean ...
great .
look at this dipshit .
hey , watch it , asshole !
fuck you !
get him , bri .
tear him up !
oh , i gotta see a man about a mule .
what ?
take a piss .
hey , see if there' s any " reebs " in the back seat .
what ?
" reebs . " beers .
that' s what we used to call them when we were kids .
that' s " beer " spelled backwards .
shit .
think i chipped the concrete , bri .
the last one .
i want you to have it for saving my ass back there .
it ain' t nothing .
i picked out that big yankee mother a year ago .
by god , i' m uglier than you are .
come on !
thank you .
how long you had your woman , bud ?
oh , three years .
she' s a good one .
she' s a breeder , you dog .
i' il tell her you said that she' s a breeder .
she' il like that .
i' il tell her .
can i get a hork off that , bud ?
do you remember them doors ?
them doors i was talking about , bri ?
i got me a couple of them , found me a couple of them in kentucky .
hell , i wasn' t even looking for the first one .
i was on the side of the road , swinging my sickle .
i turned around , and there' s this door ... ... this big old door .
and light' s coming out , blinding me , real gold .
and i' m thinking , " this can' t be .
so i close my eyes ... ... and i count one , i count two ... ... i count three , i count four , five ... ... and i open my eyes ...
it wasn' t there .
come on .
am i late ?
i' m sorry .
early and me , we got into a fight in this bar .
i' m fine , though .
i was just ...
it was me and him against , like , 30 guys .
you know , we gotta talk about your good buddy early .
who said he' s my good buddy ?
you sure been acting like you were .
out whooping it up and drinking and everything .
you' ve been drinking too .
come on .
oh , yeah , right .
you should' ve seen how scared she was that he was gonna find out .
he beats her , you know .
how do you know that ?
because she told me , that' s how i know that .
i gotta see a man about a mule .
but only when she " deserves " it .
did you happen to know that he was in jail ?
yeah .
yeah .
for stealing a car .
really ?
is that what he told you ?
he told her it was for carrying a gun .
brian , it could be for murder for all we know .
will you stop being so fucking melodramatic ?
melodramatic !
if it was murder ... ... he' d still be in jail ... ... or he' d be on parole ... ... in which case , he wouldn' t be allowed to leave the state .
maybe he wasn' t allowed to leave the state .
you ever think about that ?
oh , okay .
we' il get the keys ... ... and sneak out .
is that what you want ?
what' s wrong with you ?
can we talk about this in the morning when the room isn' t spinning ?
so how are you feeling now , brian ?
does your stomach feel kind of like it' s ... ... in these knots and it' s twisty ... ... and you could just explode at any given moment ?
well , my daddy , he used to make this great drink for hangovers .
and he' d make a blend of sauerkraut juice and tabasco sauce ...
goddamn !
you see that woman ?
she' s butt ugly .
he put in a little bit of lemon ...
hairy too . ... for the tartness .
and then the last ingredient , brian ... ... this is the best one , was an egg so that he could have breakfast ... ... and get rid of his hangover all in the same time .
shave that dog and teach it to hunt !
early lived in the moment .
he did whatever he wanted , whenever he wanted .
it was that simple .
i don' t know if i was fascinated or frightened by him .

i' il never know why early grayce became a killer .
i don' t know why any of them do .
when i looked into his eyes ... ... i felt nothing .
nothing .
that day , i learned any one of us is capable of taking another human life .
but i also learned that there is a difference between us and them .
it' s in feeling remorse .
dealing with guilt .
and confronting your conscience .
early never did .
june 22nd , the novak farm .
mr. baxter slammed the door in my face today , calling me a damn ghoul .
i' m betting he' s still alive .
real old , living in a trailer park or something somewhere .
but , he' s alive , see ?
now , he' s thinking about what he done .
going over it , over and over it , in his head every night ... ... figuring how smart he is for getting away with it .
thank you .
hey , how' s it going ?
not bad .
how was your swim ?
it' s freezing .
it' s november .

well , let' s celebrate .
i' il take you to lunch .
okay .
so , what happens next ?
i have a meeting at the gallery on thursday ... ... and they want to see some more of my work , so ...
i' m sure they' re gonna love it as much as i do .

it' s me .
it' s adele .
i know i' m probably not supposed to be talking ... ... on the tape recorder , but ...
i just wanted to say thank you ... ... for taking me and early with you on your trip ... ... because me and early' s having a really good time .
and i just hope that when we get to california ... ... that you guys don' t forget all about us .
because friends are important ... ... and , well , you' re the only friends we got .
bye .
