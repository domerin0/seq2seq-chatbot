so beautiful .
what' s that ?
did you feel something ?
yeah , i feel something .
hey , get back here !
turn up the music !
we' re having a party , man .
you guys are having fun .
boat' s rocking .
stop !
you' re paranoid !
listen .
did you hear that ?
listen , listen .
you hear that ?
what is that ?
everybody , shh !
stay up there .
what is that ?
come on !
okay , we' ve had some problems at the facility .
what we' re attempting to achieve has never been done .
we' re this close to the reactivation of a human brain cell .
doctor ... ... the $200 million i sunk into this company is due in great part to your research .
but when the market opens monday ... ... despite my reputation , i don' t like heights .
especially falling from them .
i' m sorry , honestly .
tell me , mr. franklin , have you ever known anyone with alzheimer' s ?
well , no .
by the end , all my father could do was ask why my mother wasn' t at home .
each time i said she was dead , i saw him take the loss like a car wreck .
200, 000 men and women develop alzheimer' s each year .
what if you could end all that suffering with a single pill ?
give me till monday morning .
48 hours .
i' il give you results that' il skyrocket your stock price ... ... or i' il help you pack the lab myself .
it' s your call .
that was an impressive speech you gave back there .
i read that article on you .
the thing in the himalayas .
alps .
right .
we were just trying to do something together .
having fun .
things went bad .
but you saved all those people .
not all .
navy built it for wwii submarine loading ... ... refueling .
when they mothballed it , we picked it up , added aquatic pens , underwater labs .
your dime , i guess .
looks like alcatraz floats .
what do you think ?
she' s a 12 footer .
she' s beautiful .
she wants to give you a big kiss .
i bet .
she' s got a license plate jammed in her mouth .
it' s a good deal , " amigo " .
drop her , billy !
russell franklin , janice higgins .
marine biologist .
jan will get you settled .
welcome to our island paradise .
where' s tattoo ?
you know , short guy ?
the plane , boss !
the plane !
right .
i am getting old .
how much do you know about our facility ?
treat me like a tourist .
i hate tourists and i' ve decided i' m going to like you .
louisiana .
i think he was bought in a pet shop in baton rouge .
ate everything in his tank , and then ate the guy that bought him .
next day , fills up the cab of the guy' s truck with water and drives to baja ... ... picking bones out of his teeth with the license plate .
we need to talk .
later .
carter blake , russell franklin , president of chimera pharmaceuticals .
that was incredible .
actually , they don' t like the taste of us very much .
if they bite you , it' s because they think you' re a fat little seal .
or a rich suit .
nice meeting you .
friendly place .
you got full sentences .
usually , he just kind of nods .
word travels fast about why you' re here and all .
was that the gen 1 that escaped ?
that little guy ?
no way .
those are the normals .
these three are the test sharks .
two first generation and one second generation female .
beneath its glassy surface ... ... a world of gliding monsters .
it' s pretty scary stuff , huh ?
yes .
it is .
tower to water taxi .
ben , i' m picking up a nasty little bitch of a squall about 30 miles out .
over .
copy that .
we' il be all right .
jan , stay out of the rain .
where are they going ?
they hate me too ?
they' re going home .
we run a skeleton crew on the weekend .
but they probably hate you anyway .
there' s dr. jim whitlock , the most brilliant man ever .
he' s pissing into the wind .
how brilliant can he be ?
you' il see .
what happened , deadeye ?
you miss with the first shot ?
it took two hits to even slow it down .
are you kidding ?
two of these should' ve almost killed it .
go tell it that , scoggs .
you missed .
don' t get mad at me because you can' t shoot worth a shit .
if you hadn' t left the pen open , i could' ve had a good sleep .
i already told the doc , i locked the pen like i do every night .
the fish got out some other way .
what are you looking at me like that for ?
who are you going to trust ?
me , that' s who .
you trust me .
you know why ?
because i' m trustworthy .
how high are these fences off the water ?
given the surface variations and tensile strength
short answer , man .
eight feet , give or take a centimeter .
i' m sorry .
i' m making aquatica sound like a mental hospital .
no , not really .
well , maybe a little .
the truth is , it is .
but almost everyone here is top of their game .
living below is like living in space .
you don' t get very many mistakes .
besides the catwalks ... ... you bought us titanium based fencing around all the lagoon and pens .
there are three sub levels .
sub level one is living quarters .
wet lab and workshops .
engineering and air locked wet entry .
welcome to aquatica .
did you dose the gen 2 with the serum ?
i had carter do it as soon as you called .
it should be ready tomorrow night .
but ?
we will not be ready .
two months ahead of schedule .
we' re skipping three rounds of preliminary trials .
no choice .
you wait your whole life for a single moment ... ... and then one day , it' s tomorrow .
so what exactly does a shark wrangler do ?
pretty much what it sounds like , i guess .
how' d you end up here at aquatica ?
i like the water .
pay is good .
an aga mask !
did some wreck diving in one of these , off the coast of spain .
tourist thing .
do you like wreck diving ?
it' s okay .
i bet you' re really good at it .
we' re on the water .
whole cat and mouse thing don' t float .
you' re the man , right ?
yeah , i' m the man .
the man' s always got a file .
what' s it say ?
two years , leavenworth .
smuggling .
how' d you make your money ?
you the first rich guy in history who' s squeaky clean ?
you do understand my concern , right ?
look , i got a workable deal here .
i don' t make waves .
i meet the terms of my parole .
i' m not out to change the world , like the doc .
i' m not out to wreck it either .
eat me , asshole !
hey , you dickhead !
fat butt !
you got a big , fat butt .
you know what , bird ?
you' re trying my last nerve .
don' t make me drown your feathery ass .
get myself a cat .
that' s good .
yes .
that' s good .
that' s it .
you got a nasty looking tongue , you know that ?
feeding time .
i' m releasing the tiger shark in 30 seconds .
copy ?
i hear you .
i' m going in .
you guys hungry ?
dr. mcalester , we have a situation up here .
could you please come to surface level ?
dr. mcalester , could you come to surf ace level , please ?
surprise !
happy birthday !
damn , i hate that song .
you like the tunes there , preach ?
carter , join us .
there' s too much woman on this deck for scoggs to handle .
vodka , straight .
and by the way , food was excellent , brother .
you' re that guy that got caught in that avalanche , right ?
i' m the one .
black men have enough ways to get killed ... ... without climbing up some mountain in the middle of nowhere .
you need to leave that to the white folks , " brother .
happy birthday ?
i' il let you know tomorrow .
how' s life underwater ?
it' s a lot less complicated ... ... than it is on the surface .
that' s for sure .
nice work with that new tiger shark today .
one day , you' il have to tell me how you learned that .
one day , you' il take me up on that beer and maybe i will .
it' s all work for me , carter .
but , like you said , " one day .
sharks never get cancer , go blind or show loss of brain activity as they age .
unlike some people i know .
sharks are the oldest creatures on the planet ... ... from a time when the world was just flesh and teeth .
by using a hormonal enhancer ... ... we increased this female' s forebrain to five times its normal size .
to harvest more protein .
exactly .
a protein that may reactivate
that will .... ... that will reactivate human brain cells stored in the forebrain of the shark .
i' m just amazed that we' ve come so far , so fast , without genetic tampering .
genetic engineering to increase brain mass violates the harvard genetics compact .
not to mention chimera policy .
they' re hunting in packs .
like wild dogs .
they' il only eat other sharks .
you' re reading too much into it .
that gen 1 attacked a 25 foot boat .
am i reading too much into that too ?
did you tell franklin ?
i' m just a fish keeper , lady .
but bringing in that shark ahead of schedule was a very bad idea .
do you like your job ?
are you threatening me , doc ?
no .
but if we don' t pull off that test tomorrow , we' re all on the street .
you' re a good man , carter .
but with your background ....
right .
how' s miss smarty pants ?
hope she' s not as dumb as she seems .
raise those fences like i asked ?
i took care of it .
let' s go get a beer .
all craft warnings for waters south of the us mainland and west of ca .
a tropical depression is generating gale force winds ... ... and is associated with heavy rains and ocean swells to 30 feet or more .
any of your nonsense , and we' il have tiny drumsticks on the menu tonight .
fat butt !
that' s right .
you can ... all you want .
welcome to my parlor , mr. franklin .
wow .
wet lab , we' re taking a pounding up here .
can' t see past my nose .
so i suggest you check pen monitors and lagoon monitors .
i can' t imagine there' s much visibility below .
carter , you copy ?
okay , i' m approaching the tunnel .
bingo .
elvis has left the building .
we picked you up , but visibility' s near zero .
no problem .
how long have they been synchronized like this ?
tell me i didn' t see that .
they recognized that gun !
that' s impossible .
sharks can' t swim backwards !
try to stay focused .
what was that ?
we lost picture in gen 2 pen .
okay , hold on .
carter , do you copy ?
carter , do you copy ?
carter , talk to me , man .
do you copy ?
cut the crap !
you' re scaring everybody .
boarding platform engaged .
he' s got her .
did someone order the fish ?
what in god' s creation ?
no , not his .
ours .
commencing scan .
gen 2 is online .
transferring exotics to remote terminals .
vital signs to terminal 1 .
diagnostic imaging to terminal 2 .
we' re live and in color !
bp , 67 over 43 .
heart rate , 50 bpm .
within norm .
she' s sleeping like a baby .
bad dream ?
in position .
vitals are stable .
vitals ?
holding .
aspirating 4 . 5 cc .
introducing 2 cc of the protein complex ... ... into cultured , inactive brain neurons of an alzheimer' s patient .
and what you' re looking for here is lightning in a bottle .
protein complex is interacting with the neurons .
neurons are becoming hyperosmotic .
membrane integrity' s improving .
they' re firing !
they' re firing !
one second .
two .
three .
still firing .
four .
five .
six .
6 . 560 seconds .
i' il be damned .
no , sir .
for 6 . 560 seconds ... ... you saw what it' s like not to be damned .
congratulations .
impressed ?
overly impressed .
6 . 560 seconds .
now that you' ve got this ... ... how long before you make something permanent ?
you did it , pal .
you did it .
no !
carter , no !
are you insane ?
tower , we need paramedics and evac now !
all frequencies , sos .
this is research station aquatica .
we have a medical emergency .
this is research station aquatica .
we have a medical emergency .
please respond .
x ray alpha 2 18 .
coming off oil platform chiapa .
we' il take that post you' ve always wanted .
got it .
he' s hemorrhaging !
they say the yellow butterflies are thick as clouds there , remember ?
research station aquatica , this is x ray alpha 2 18 .
have you in sight .
approaching from 0 6 0 .
copy , 2 18 .
stay with him .
keep talking .
let' s move !
i' m not this kind of doctor .
just keep doing what you' re doing .
where' s the chopper ?
tower ?
come on , brenda .
where' s my chopper ?
franklin , this end !
keep it coming !
ready .
it' s all right , honey .
hold on .
got it .
okay , move him out .
let' s go !
i love you !
come on !
get up !
come on !
come on , carter !
pull up , 2 18 !
pull up !
damn !
i can' t get a picture .
tower , have you got a visual ?
copy .
i can' t get anything .
do you copy ?
going to back up .
got it !
i' m going to take this as a sign .
where is he now ?
where is he ?
the whole system' s shut down .
brenda ?
are you there ?
this thing is dead .
somebody , please ... ... tell me what that is .
please .
all right , people , let' s move .
now !
get to the door !
come on .
you can' t help him .
the door frame is bent .
open .
open it !
turn it !
turn it !
no !
tower , can you hear me ?
anyone , hello ?
we got to get topside , find some help .
what ?
we' re flooded .
shit !
there' s no other stairway from this level .
elevator ?
it seals off automatically to keep the shaft from filling .
there' s no way up .
all right .
okay .
if this is a lesson about the drinking , let' s just say i' ve learned it .
no need to get carried away , showing me your vengeful side .
i know your wrath , lord .
if corridor b is dry ... ... we go back to the maintenance ladder , climb down to level 3 .
we get to the wet entry .
we take the sub topside , two at a time .
we go down to get up .
all right , let' s move .
come on .
sounds like somebody made it .
over here !
we' re over here !
preach ?
what the hell is that ?
lab equipment maybe , banging around .
think so ?
not a chance .
we got to get past that door .
let' s go !
come on !
open the door !
go !
go !
bird !
come on , bird !
where are you , bird ?
hey , dickhead !
bird ?
fat butt !
bird ?
anybody here ?
cowboy , let me ask you a question .
we should keep moving .
i' m talking to him !
was that a goddamn shark that broke through that door ?
i expect so .
you expect so ?
well , well , well .
am i the only asshole down here who thinks that a tad bit odd ?
it can do that ?
bust through a steel door ?
i ain' t the expert .
given gen 2' s size and some room to move ... ... she could put a couple tons , maybe more , into a hit .
so , yeah , in my opinion .
if she wants through , she' s coming .
and these sharks ... ... they aren' t breaking down doors for the sheer joy of it , are they ?
they' re after us .
it' s obvious we don' t know what they' re doing .
what the hell did you do to those sharks ?
their brains weren' t large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein .
so we violated the harvard compact .
jim and i used gene therapies to increase their brain mass .
larger brain means more protein .
as a side effect , the sharks got smarter .
you stupid bitch !
i didn' t want this to happen ... ... but with this research , we could wipe out degenerative brain disease .
think of the generations that would be saved .
how much dynamite do you have to set off in your ears before your head clears ?
you wouldn' t understand .
i wouldn' t ?
dumb old carter wouldn' t understand that you used us ?
that you used me ?
someone on the water who wouldn' t make waves .
someone who wouldn' t ask too many questions .
because he had something to lose .
you don' t see what we' ve done here .
you' ve taken god' s oldest killing machine and given it will and desire .
you' ve knocked us to the bottom of the goddamn food chain .
it' s not a great leap forward , in my book .
the people we' il save ....
jim ?
brenda ?
us ?
all right , people .
these sharks are thinking hard and clear .
so here' s the riddle .
what does an 8, 000 pound mako shark ... ... with a brain the size of a v8 engine and no natural predators , think about ?
i' m not waiting around here to find out .
now you see how that works ?
she screwed with the sharks and now the sharks are screwing with us .
please let me get out of here .
what if the sharks get through the fence and into the ocean ?
it' s okay .
the fence on the ocean side is titanium .
and it gives , so it works just like a net .
let' s get to the sub .
we' il discuss it on the way to the top .
eat me , asshole .
careful , now .
come on , bird .
come on .
please , baby .
dickhead .
see daddy smiling ?
come on .
bring your feathery ass here .
come on .
explosion caused that ?
no .
nothing in here could' ve blown with enough force to move that damn sub .
whatever .
it' s junk .
we could all just dive in and see who makes it to the top .
isn' t that the old aquatica spirit , dr. susie ?
just dive in .
you could go first , to lead by example .
he was my best friend , janice .
i' m not going in the water .
no way , man !
the sharks are in there .
listen !
we put these on .
they help fight hypothermia .
that' s a start .
and unless someone' s got a better idea ... ... we' re going to have to swim out of here .
this isn' t happening .
i' m not daniel when he faced the lion !
so i appreciate the irony , lord !
cook dies in his own oven !
but i' ve got other plans !
you ate my bird .
was that the surface ?
no , the vibrations are too deep .
that was from inside .
i wouldn' t get that close .
just a suggestion .
water' s murky .
we might make it .
no way !
no , we won' t !
it' s 230 feet ... ... from the lagoon floor to the lagoon surface !
the average human swims two feet per second .
the average shark swims 50 feet per second .
there' s no way i' m getting into that pool !
what we have here is your basic maintenance ladder .
this leads up to the surface .
i love you , scoggs .
i really do !
why do i feel a " but " coming on ?
but we don' t know what shape the surface level is in .
the shaft is air locked .
but if the explosion breached the shaft at surface level ... ... we won' t have enough pressure to stabilize the wet pool .
if the pool isn' t stabilized , there' s tons of ocean dying to get in .
you' il bring the whole facility down .
we' re better off with the sharks .
you want to swim with your fishes ?
go ahead !
i' m opening this door and climbing out of here !
the hell you are !
i don' t work for you anymore !
i don' t have to take orders !
enough !
that' s enough now , from all of you !
you think water' s fast ?
you should see ice .
it moves like it has a mind .
like it knows it killed the world once .
it got a taste for murder .
when the avalanche came ... ... it took us a week to climb out .
and somewhere we lost hope .
i don' t know when we turned on each other .
i just know ... ... that seven of us survived the slide ... ... and only five made it out .
now , we took an oath that i' m breaking now .
swore that we' d say it was the snow that killed the other two .
but it wasn' t .
nature can be lethal .
but it doesn' t hold a candle to man .
you' ve seen how bad things can get and how quick they can get that way .
well , they can get a whole lot worse .
so we' re not going to fight anymore !
we' re going to pull together and find a way to get out of here !
first , we' re going to seal off this pool !
oh , my god .
it just ate him .
it just ate him .
christ !
i' m not moving .
i' m not moving .
someone will come .
they' il come and they' il get us , and we' il be fine .
no .
i' m not moving .
listen , tom , what is the precise structural failure limit for aquatica ?
3, 200 tons .
what happens when we get more than 3, 200 tons of water in this rig ?
the support struts go first .
their tolerance is about seven tons .
they' il crack like toothpicks .
the walls will buckle .
they can' t handle more than 10 tons of pressure .
you want to be here for that ?
hell , no .
the moment of truth .
again .
go !
go !
go !
i got you .
it' s burning !
the elevator' s blocking the top .
if we make it to level 1 , we can take the stairs out .
let' s get out of here !
go !
go !
what are you doing ?
if they break through , water will bring them right to us .
level 2 is only partially flooded .
if i can get that door open ... ... the water will run off there , buy us some time .
big , real big .
what' s that ?
the size of your brass balls .
be careful .
go !
jan , stay there !
get me out of here , carter !
i don' t want to die !
grab my hand !
come on !
i can' t !
i can' t reach !
take it !
i can' t reach !
can you reach that door above you ?
it' s too high .
it' s too high .
sharks probably flooded that level too .
good thing you came to this side .
the other side' s underwater .
we didn' t exactly plan it .
yeah , it wasn' t planned .
are you all that made it ?
we did it .
we' re on level 1 .
we can take the stairs to the surface .
the stairs are flooded .
trust me , i know .
are you sure ?
give us a goddamn break , can' t you ?
he always answers .
sometimes , the answer you get isn' t the answer you want .
we' re 60 feet from the surface .
there' s an emergency hatch on this level , right ?
this level has bilge pumps on it for storm runoff .
if we re route the emergency generators , we could drain a stairway .
you sure ?
who you going to trust ?
you .
that' s right .
you trust me .
we had poker here tomorrow night .
she' d always draw to the inside straight when she could' ve stuck with a pair .
big dreams .
standards .
jan was a healthy girl .
something in here has to run on batteries .
nice .
where would a girl keep her ... ... thing ?
what' s the matter with you ?
my skin' s starting to hemorrhage .
the sharks smell the blood .
this' il coat it with oil .
look , carter , what you said down there ... ... maybe you were right .
everything i' ve done ... ... i don' t think i could' ve done it without you .
i know , susan .
that' s the problem .
four a . m .
i know .
one night feels like a whole week .
relativity .
what do you mean ?
einstein' s theory of relativity .
grab hold of a hot pan , a second can seem like an hour .
put your hands on a hot woman ... ... an hour can seem like a second .
it' s all relative .
i spent four years at cal tech .
that' s the best physics explanation i' ve heard .
it works .
you stay with the doc .
me and scoggs are going to try to get to the wet lab ... ... drain that stairwell .
preach ?
what ?
would you zip me up , please ?
we got one , there' s two sharks left ... ... and you and the doc are doing a little bathroom love .
they got a pill for what' s wrong with you ?
i need to get some things from my quarters .
research data .
the tests , they worked .
so much death around us , to risk any more life for some numbers ....
without that data , everyone dying isn' t just tragic , it' s useless .
death is always useless , doctor .
this is it .
stay here .
i' il be back before you know it .
what' s going on ?
what the hell' s going on ?
what is that ?
it' s okay !
what is that ?
we' re all right !
what the fuck ?
it' s okay .
i thought you were coming back for me .
one of your monitors is blocking the panel .
you want to help me move it ?
i say we do everything right together .
right together .
hello .
my name is sherman dudley ... ... and if this message finds you , i did not survive , so this is my legacy .
i have loved the pulpit and i have loved the bottle .
i did my best to be a good husband , a f ather .
i came up wanting .
so what do i have to say to you ?
what mark do i have to leave behind ?
we' il begin with the perfect omelet , made with two eggs , not three .
amateurs often add milk for density .
this is a mistake .
come on !
i got you .
come on .
damn you , scoggs .
where' s susan ?
i' m done .
brothers never make it out of situations like this .
not ever !
did you do it ?
where' s scoggins ?
i hate to interrupt this moment of burgeoning intimacy ... ... but can we get the fuck out of here ?
is this the only way ?
exits are flooded .
whole place is sinking .
it' s this way or no way at all .
you can bring on the good news anytime now .
sharks are attracted to churning water , bright colors .
these extinguishers will be a distraction .
what about us ?
the vest' il bring you up too fast .
your lungs' il pop like a balloon .
you weren' t the sunny kid in your class .
i never went to class .
how far to the surface ?
sixty feet ?
there' s nothing to it .
exhale on the way up , and get the hell out of the water .
i got to equalize the pressure before we blow the air lock .
i got to let the room fill up with water .
it' il only take a few seconds .
you ready ?
no .
not in the least .
though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death ...
... i shall fear no evil ...
... for thou art with me ...
... thy rod and thy staff , they comfort me .
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life ... " ... because i carry a big stick ... ... and i' m the meanest motherfucker in the valley .
two sharks down , lord .
one demon fish to go .
can i get an " amen " ?
amen !
i can' t hear you !
amen !
give me an " amen " !
stay with us , lord !
amen .
okay , hold on three !
ready ?
one !
two !
three !
swim !
oh , my god !
it' s the devil , you know .
he' il be okay if we can get out of here .
son of a bitch .
what ?
those fences are titanium underneath , but on top , they' re just plain steel .
they' ve been herding us , pushing us where they want .
using us to flood the facility .
oh , my god .
that' s the answer to the riddle .
because that' s what an 8, 000 pound mako thinks about .
about freedom .
about the deep blue sea .
we have to kill her .
that' s the first real smart thing you' ve said all day .
here we go .
let' s go .
we ought to get 2 . 5 sticks of dynamite out of these flares .
from up here , you ought to be able to see me spear it .
when i do , you take this end of this cable ... ... hook it up to the positive side of the boat battery .
and boom !
damn !
i can' t get her !
she' s too far away !
i know how to get her .
how ?
bait .
she may be the smartest animal in the world ... ... but she' s still just an animal .
come to mama .
no !
susan , don' t !
get out of the water !
all right , lord ....
shoot it , preach !
this is for scoggins .
shoot it !
damn !
blow it , preach !
blow it !
the battery !
blow it !
do it !
bring me some sushi !
forty five foot shark ... ... and you hit me .
nice .
could' ve been worse .
i could' ve let him eat your ass .
carter , we' re sinking , right ?
yeah .
let me ask you something .
are you sure it was just three sharks ?
yeah .
