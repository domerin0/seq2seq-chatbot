for my daughter mingxia
london , 2 : 30 pm
hi , mom .
hi , dear .
i have bad news .
your dad' s prognosis isn' t good .
you have to come .
did he ask you to call ?
not in so many words .
we saw each other for 15 minutes last summer .
with his flat , bank account , insurance , the university ...
your sister' s in australia .
it' s too much for me .
i' il see if gaelle can come .
hi , love .
he' s worse ?
i have to be there .
i' il come .
the barbarlan invaslons
the body of christ .
the body of christ .
the communion' s over here .
the body of christ .
how' s mr desmarais ?
i don' t know .
i' m not mr desmarais .
sorry , the computer system is a mess .
constance lazure .
my wife louise .
must be hard having him here .
i threw him out 15 years ago .
so whether he' s here or humping co eds in his condo ...
gimme a break .
you know it' s been years since i humped a co ed
and raphaelle metellus ?
she was dominique' s student .
you were her personal tutor ?
kneel down , open wide .
i' d best continue my rounds .
have a good day !
you too , sister .
i called sebastien to let him know .
you did ?
aren' t you glad ?
lovely , we can play his video games .
he' s still young .
ok , but couldn' t he have read one book in his life ?
any book ?
is that asking too much ?
he may not read , but he earns more in a month than you in a year .
thanks a lot .
that' s ok , we had room .
it' s flying to belfast monday ...
i' il probably have to stay longer .
my darling !
you must be exhausted .
what time is it for you ?
2 a . m . ?
gaelle , how are you , dear ?
fine , thank you .
hello , sir .
young man .
do you remember gaelle ?
gaelle is unforgettable .
how are you ?
no private rooms ?
i' m lucky i' m not in the hall .
i tried , all i got was voice mail .
dad' s very sick .
please get in touch .
what i see isn' t encouraging .
but to be sure i need a pet scan .
see if they can do it .
they can send it by satellite .
it stands for positron emission tomography .
sherbrooke has one , but there' s a 6 12 month waiting list .
isn' t he going to burlington today ?
they have one , but it' s expensive . $2000 u. s.
money' s no problem .
you' re lucky .
you never listened to my body .
but i' m not laying a guilt .
look , i have to get dressed .
an ambulance is taking me to burlington in 10 minutes .
no more excuses !
for my radiation therapy .
no !
the machines here are too old .
stop avoiding me .
this is my son , sebastien , he' s going with me .
she' s a woman i used to know , long ago .
i couldn' t face coming alone .
you' ve never been here ?
never .
but you see each other regularly .
always on neutral ground .
usually in restaurants .
did he come to your place ?
occasionally .
but you never came here .
no .
this was where he brought his mistresses .
with luck , we' il find some panties .
i' m glad sebastien' s going with him today .
it' s important they talk .
christmas in the scanner , easter 6 feet under .
i have the scan .
it doesen' t look good .
not good at all .
we can' t be certain , but the margin of error is almost nil .
is he in a lot of pain ?
why don' t you bring him here ?
at least he wouldn' t suffer .
we' il make sure of it .
i' m sorry , buddy .
baltimore' s not far .
7 hours by car , an hour by plane .
i won' t go into exile .
wouldn' t you like your own room with a bathroom , cds ?
what cds ?
so you can listen to music .
they have that in civilized countries .
know what that costs ?
nothing .
i' il look after it .
i won' t know a soul .
we' il all go tomorrow .
no we won' t .
i' m not going to the states ,
i voted for medicare , i' il accept the consequences .
only idiots refuse to change .
i want to be with my friends .
your friends ?
where are they ?
dominique' s away , but pierre ...
you' ve no one .
apart from that lunatic this morning .
which lunatic ?
it' s irrelevant .
my remy !
who' s he talking about ?
marlene dupire .
you didn' t sleep with marlene dupire ?
she' s a certified nut , everyone knows !
you wrecked your family for her kind ?
i wrecked nothing !
you ruined mom' s life , my adolescence , sylvaine' s ...
blaming me for her failure ?
she loves the sea , she sails the world , delivering yachts .
beats a 3rd rate university .
you may be a millionaire , but you know nothing !
i know i won' t end up like you !
she' s the reason i' m here .
she raised me , not you !
don' t you have a plane to catch to hong kong ?
i don' t need you , not for one second !
go to hell !
fuck you !
go to hell !
we' re returning to london .
you can' t .
we offer him the finest hospital , he refuses .
you heard him .
he' il never change .
you plan to have kids ?
definitely .
until you' re a parent you' il never understand .
he changed your diapers .
he called your teachers every month all through school .
he so wanted you to do well .
when you had meningitis at age 3 , he rocked you in his arms for 48 hours non stop , without sleep , to keep death at bay .
you can' t remember that .
what should i do ?
find his friends .
find him a comfortable room .
that shouldn' t be hard .
the ministry forbids changing hospitals .
anyway , they' d park him in the hall in emergency .
the floor below is empty ?
2 years , now .
could he move there ?
ice cream with your pie ?
you can always ask at administration .
good luck !
i' il leave you now .
you' re lucky to have such a caring son .
you think so ?
how many children come here ?
look around !
see many children at their parent' s bedside ?
i' m here every day , so i know .
was your dad hospitalized ?
did he die there ?
in the end .
did you visit him ?
he lived in chicoutimi , i was in montreal .
you came from england ?
london , chicoutimi , for you ... same thing ?
are you becoming confused ?
when it' s over , press end .
that stops it .
it' s hard , but if you concentrate , you' il manage .
hi , dad !
see , the pacific ocean .
we sail from sydney to new caledonia , on to easter island and finally valparaiso .
i' m sending you lots of sea air .
they say it' s good for your health .
i have to go .
satellite connections cost a fortune .
i' m sending you lots and lots of kisses .
bye for now !
security badge ?
ms pelletier ?
lloyd' s of london .
didn' t they give you one ?
no .
last door on the right .
but next time you need a badge .
hello .
pauline joncas pelletier .
please have a seat .
so you' re with lloyd' s of london ?
not at all , i said that to get in .
my father' s here .
i' d like to move him to the empty floor .
set up something more comfortable .
that' s wonderful !
it complies with our awareness programs involving family members .
but unfortunately our allocation of infrastructure is determined by the ministry' s ambulatory thrust .
it' s absolutely impossible to target our responses in terms of individual beneficiaries .
i' m sure our staff ...
i prepared this file .
you must understand , our resource allocation aims at prioritizing responses according to diagnostic parameters defined by the region 02 consultations .
this is silly .
we' re not in the third world .
think it over .
even if we close our eyes , we' d require union integration .
and that is problematic !
i' il handle them .
this file will be updated weekly .
i' il come back tomorrow .
thank you !
there' s a room on the empty floor .
it' il take 5 minutes .
i just want to show you .
i' il be back in 5 .
sorry , take the next one .
i want to set up a room on this floor .
we could ...
look , nothing happens without the union .
it starts and ends with the union .
understand ?
i came to you , right ?
you' d have to paint it , scrub the floor ...
just a sec , man .
you' re talking overtime , you realize .
and my guys don' t .
paid in cash .
cash ?
cash .
one painter .
two .
six hours .
eight .
what' s the rate ? $40 . $35 .
i want a bed , curtains , chairs ...
look , man , we don' t do that .
you hire a crew , supervise the work .
and charge me a reasonable fee .
reasonable ?
let' s say 25 % .
here' s $2500 for starters .
we' il settle up every 2 days .
where' s my laptop ?
what ?
my computer .
on the floor .
it' s not there .
it must be .
nothing there .
the floor , not the locker .
i' m not crazy .
it' s not there .
someone must have taken it .
who ?
i don' t know .
i' ve had 50 emails .
how' il i recover them ?
my entire deal with norway .
there' s no backup .
do you know what i do ?
no .
you never told me .
why bother ?
you never listen !
there were , what , 3000 dead .
historically , that' s insignificant .
as a u. s. example , 50, 000 died at the battle of gettysburg .
what is significant , as my old prof said , is they struck at the heart of the empire .
in previous conflicts korea , vietnam , the gulf war the empire managed to keep the barbarians outside its gates , its borders
in that sense , people may look back on 9/ 11 , and i stress may , as the beginning of the great barbarian invasions .
alain lussier , thank you .
my pleasure .
excuse me , my computer was just stolen .
oh yeah ?
fill out this form .
what for ?
it' s for the police .
look , i' ve had all these since monday .
the police ever investigate ?
no , only when there' s physical violence .
last week a woman was raped in the old laundry room , so they came .
otherwise they' d be here 24/ 7 .
it' s easy to rob patients .
they' re asleep half the time .
and the union protects the employees .
there' s not much we can do .
ronald ?
what can i do for you , pal ?
i lost or misplaced my computer .
maybe in my dad' s room .
so , on the off chance someone should find a laptop somewhere ...
we' il ask around , but i can' t guarantee anything .
in case .
right , in case .
we' il check .
thanks , i appreciate it .
hello ?
speaking .
of course i remember you , sebastien .
how are you ?
yes , it' s been a long time .
he' s very sick .
and he' s all alone , except for my mother .
i knew he was in hospital , but i didn' t realize ...
i almost never come to montreal , so ...
is he still in hospital ?
pierre , i need you , now .
school' s starting , we haven' t found a daycare , the kids are sick ...
that' s life .
always the same .
i' il try to get a flight .
you say that because times are so terrible .
not especially terrible .
not at all .
contrary to belief , the 20th centaury wasn' t that bloody .
it' s agreed that wars caused 100 million deaths .
add 10 million for the russian gulags .
the chinese camps , we' il never know , but say 20 million .
so 130 , 135 million dead .
not all that impressive .
in the 16th centuary , the spanish and the portuguese managed , without gas chambers or bombs , to slaughter 150 million indians in latin america .
with axes !
that' s a lot of work , sister .
even if they had church support , it was an achievement
so much so that the dutch , english , french and later americans followed their lead and butchered another 50 million .
200 million dead in all !
the greatest massacre in history took place right here .
and not the tiniest holocaust museum .
the history of mankind is a history of horrors !
they had a trial program with heroin .
see if it still exists .
heroin' s 800 % more effective than morphine .
it makes a huge difference .
ok , thanks .
get some rest .
i will , good night .
are you pals with the premier , or a hockey star ?
his son takes care of him .
i know .
and dumbo won' t thank him .
my son is an ambitious and puritanical capitalist .
whereas i was always a sensual socialist .
sensual isn' t half of it , sister .
lewd ! debauched !
bestial !
lascivious !
perverse !
how are you , you lusty sinner ?
better !
give me a kiss , you randy snake !
you' re back ?
yesterday ?
and alaska ?
lovely and cold , like me !
you see , sister ?
my exquisite daughter in law , my heroic wife , and two most charming mistresses .
i can die in peace .
you' il burn in the flames of hell .
and i won' t be alone .
they' re safe , but given the depravity of these two , they' il roast alongside me .
whereas you' il play the harp on a cloud for eternity , seated between john paul il , a surly pole , and mother theresa , a slimy albanian
his illness has affected his brain .
no , it' s an ethnological truth , louise .
albanians are often slimy and poles are always surly . " for the misfortunes of poland are proof of god' s existence !
hello .
i' d like to meet someone , a police officer or detective in the narcotics squad .
have a seat .
come stai , you big pig ?
what are you doing here , old queer ?
this is alessandro .
we' ve heard all about you .
gilles levac .
my partner , kim delgado .
have a seat .
thanks .
my father' s hospitalized here in montreal .
he gets rotten care , of course , and he' s in pain .
a doctor friend suggested i get him some heroin .
i know little about drugs .
as a student i smoked pot .
drugs are sold in every city , and the police know where .
i hoped , perhaps naively , you could recommend some spots where i can find high quality heroin .
that' s fascinating , except that ... our job is to arrest dealers , not help prospective buyers . think of me as a smart guy trying to save time .
police help our journalist to buy narcotics .
i' m no ... she and i don' t want to end our days directing traffic in chibougamau .
i swear i' m not a reporter .
why should i believe you ?
i' m a market operator with macdougall deutsch .
it' s easy to check .
it' s easy to print phony cards .
sorry to disturb you .
i' il have to try the discos .
look , the citrouillard family !
claude , i don' t believe it !
how are you ?
heroin used to be for the rich .
now prices have dropped and that' s changed .
but traditionally it' s the drug of musicians and poets ...
you mean , ask my friends ?
i don' t mean anything .
i' m repeating rumors circulated in the media .
ok .
what exactly do you do ?
my dear , i' m the director of the canadian university institute of rome .
what exactly does it do , the canadian university institute of rome ?
in fact we' re a leading cultural agency that assists canadian university students in rome .
and how many canadian university students are there in rome ?
in fact , a few .
why do you ask ?
we like to know how our taxes are being squandered .
we' re a very modest operation .
naturally the director requires paid housing ... ... where you' re always welcome , of course .
you haven' t been hit by cutbacks ?
quite impossible .
the institute is buried in the budgetary quagmire of foreign affairs .
the minister himself has no inkling we exist .
who should i have slept with to get that job ?
i' m afraid that people i slept with would' ve been blind to your charms , however abundant they are .
abundance has it fans , dearie .
not in foreign affairs .
this it ?
someone found it somewhere ?
that' s it .
i have to get heroin for him .
i need someone with contacts .
i' ve been away too long .
the only poweder i sniff now is baby' s own .
i could try to ask my daughter .
remember nathalie ?
yes , a little .
i can' t promise anything .
i rarely hear from her .
hi , sweetheart .
it' s mom .
it' s diane .
i miss you , sweetheart .
look , remember sebastien , remy' s son ?
you often played together as kids .
he wants to meet .
he needs some information .
so call whenever you like , at any time .
if you prefer not to talk to me , i' il leave you his number .
we have to hit costco before 6 .
we need a shitload of diapers .
children cost so much .
why do people in the third world have so many ?
what a dumb thing to say .
your poor students , if you teach such crap !
did you get that book i mentioned ?
which one ?
inner healing by swami rapudanthra .
no , unfortunately not .
i' il bring it .
your body' s in your head .
illness starts and ends in the head .
i keep telling pierre that .
well , we' il be going .
see you soon .
how old is she ?
it' s not about age .
her breasts outweigh her brain .
cut it out .
it' s true !
the quantity of blood they require drains the brain .
it' s physiological .
no wisecracks .
she' s given me two girls who' ve transformed my life .
and a mere brush of her hand makes me as hard as a bull .
which you' il agree is a godsend at our age .
nathalie ?
i didn' t recognize you .
come .
do you work full time ?
what do you do ?
proofreader .
for a publishing company ?
boreal press .
so your hours are flexible .
my proposal is that i pay for your supplies , as well as my father' s .
want brown or white ?
i' ve no idea .
to smoke or shoot up ?
i trust you .
you shouldn' t .
why not ?
you should never trust a junkie .
they make a habit of lying .
it' s right there .
how much ? $500 .
it' s pretty chilly , huh ?
that girl' s innocent .
she' s doing me a favor .
arrest me , but forget her .
arrest you ?
think i' m a fool ?
not at all .
you located olivier in two days .
nice going .
olivier ?
the dealer .
why not arrest him ?
want me to arrest everyone ?
recognize him ?
he' s michel richer , the biologist .
you never bust suppliers ?
all the time .
we work 2, 3 years , bust an iranian gang .
and then iraqis took their place .
or the lebanese , turks , italians .
there' s too much demand .
it' s an invasion .
what are you doing here ?
i mean , now ?
my job .
i see .
keeping the peace .
the fish are biting in zampino' s pond .
time to go fishing .
what did you study ?
why do you ask ?
curious .
criminology , minor in psych .
you ?
mathematics , minor in economics .
take care .
you too .
you don' t remember me ?
no .
i was close to your mom .
you mean you slept with her ?
not just that .
were you married ?
yes .
the married ones never stayed till morning .
i' d see them if i woke up at night .
from a child' s perspective , it must seem sordid .
we called it sexual liberation .
what' s that ?
heroin .
it comes from opium , right ?
it' s morphine mixed with chemicals .
will you inject it ?
we' il start inhaling and then see .
it' s incredible to ...
be quiet now .
try to concentrate .
the first time is the best .
it' s the one you long for .
it' s called riding the dragon .
morning .
good morning .
it smells .
have you been smoking ?
not on your life .
i light a candle and meditate .
where' s your iv ?
dr levesque had it removed .
good morning , my doctresses .
take a deep breath .
does it hurt here ?
oh , yes .
and here too ?
there too , yes .
is it unbearable ?
goodness , no !
you' re in high spirits .
couldn' t be higher !
how do you sleep ?
like a baby .
then i won' t prescribe painkillers .
forget it !
that' s wonderful .
i always say , the longer they stay lucid , the better .
i plan to remain lucid till i die .
wonderful , mr paranteau .
thanks so much , dr. dube .
i' m not dr. dube .
how fitting , because i' m not mr. parenteau .
who' s he ?
so it all started with maria goretti .
exactly .
the girl who said , no !
which one was maria goretti ?
a portuguese peasant .
portuguese ?
santa maria goretti !
she was italian ?
from nettuno .
portugal , that' s fatima , the apparitions , the virgin , the shepherds .
the secret of fatima .
which only the pobe could hear .
poor canada , in 1960 .
look , we believed it .
so they filmed the edifying life of maria goretti .
starring ?
i' ve racked my brains .
ines orsini .
of course !
the immortal ines orisini !
how could i forget ?
i saw it at school in padua with the jesuits .
me , the jesuits at brebeuf .
me , at the chicoutimi seminary .
for the whole film the immortal ines orsini is covered from head to toe .
but at some point they had to at least suggest the abject nature of the bestial desire of the vile rapist .
so the exquisite maria dips her adorable toes into the ocean .
with a regal but modest gesture , she lifts her skirt ...
the thighs of ines orsini !
even i remember !
oh , the rivers of sperm i spilled dreaming of her thighs .
so that explains the rise in the level of the st. lawrence river .
for years i' d fall asleep with a hard on , dreaming of ines orsini , until the day i saw francoise hardy on tv singing all the boys and girls .
i was suddenly indifferent to ines' s holy airs .
maria goretti , alone , abandoned the fate of womanhood
for a long time i slept with francoise hardy .
we were very happy .
alas , i discovered julie christie in a film .
our mad affair lasted six months , till i met chris evert , the tennis champ , whom i left for the sublime karen kain dancing carmen in marseille .
all my life i went to bed with the world' s most gorgeous women .
then one morning i awoke realizing i' d fallen asleep dreaming of the caribbean .
i' d grown old .
women had deserted my dreams .
it' s been so long since i dreamed of a man .
just what is it you do ?
you' re president of a norwegian oil firm .
you' ve bought a north sea oil field from a failing u. s. company .
you can produce oil for $7 per barrel , and you sell for $25 .
but you want to limit your exposure to fluctuating oil prices .
how ?
no idea .
you see me , we do a swap .
what' s that ?
a deal where my bank pays you a set price and you pay the floating price .
you contract to sell your oil at a set price for a set period .
in short ,
i manage financial risk .
are you good at what you do ?
pretty good .
could you get the driver to stop at the lake ?
probably .
i' d like to see it again .
at berkley i did my phd alongside locken and donaldson , two future pulitzers .
they were no better than me , but they were american .
me , i came back here , i started to teach , got married ,
and then ... then nothing .
your women kept you too busy .
that was small time , like you said .
no , what i lacked was extravagance .
i went in for pathetic trysts in poorly heated east end flats .
i was replaced by a ta within 48 hours .
the dean neglected to say goodbye .
the lowliest secretary gets a cake for maternity leave .
ladies and gentlemen , for health reasons i' il be unable to complete this term .
ms raphaelle metellus will replace me .
does this affect our deadlines ?
no , deadlines and exam dates remain unchanged .
any other questions ?
good luck .
thanks .
so , as you saw last week , the 1840 election was particularly stormy .
the whig party , then newly formed , united four distinct constituencies
first , the national republicans , followers of adams and clay , the party founders .
irina' s home , i have to go out .
is nathalie buying for you ?
she' s a friend .
if you' re a regular , maybe we should deal directly .
it' s only temporary .
everything in life is temporary . " you can never swim in the same river twice , " said ... what' s his face ?
you know ...
you can' t count on nathalie .
she' il pull a fast one on you .
we' il see .
you know where i live .
sure .
what are you doing ?
i was waiting for you .
you' re always on my mind .
i know , you' ve told me .
at night i picture you bleeding in an alley , in shooting galleries .
i' m always so scared .
it' s unbearable .
you imagine too much .
you know this can' t go on .
of course i know .
i know it better than you .
i know it' s my fault , that' s what' s killing me .
that doesn' t change anything .
i don' t need this .
you don' t care much about living , do you ?
not really .
i was like you at your age .
ready to die at any time .
i didn' t care .
that' s why the young people make the best martyrs .
i' ve got 20 years left , 15 , 10 .
when you realize it' s for the last time .
i' m buying my last car .
this is my last trip to genoa , barcelona ...
i won' t live that long .
how do you know ?
overdoses are pretty frequent .
but you can never tell .
maybe you' il kick it and reach a ripe old age .
we can' t decipher the past , how can we know the future ?
no one ever knows what' il happen to them .
except me , now .
i know .
are you scared ?
sure am .
i don' t want to stop living .
i loved life so much .
what was it you loved ?
everything .
wine , books , music , women , above all women .
their smell , their mouths , the feel of their skin .
were there many of them ?
yes .
don' t they begin to seem the same ?
a bit , yes .
but i never get tired of them .
still the great seducer ?
no , not anymore .
with age , it' s not the same thing .
do you still enjoy wine ?
unfortunately not .
not with my liver .
the trips you dreamed of , did you make them ?
nowadays there are tourists everywhere .
it' s not the present you cling on , it' s your past life .
that life is already dead .
perhaps .
i expected a musty antique dealer , not a ravishing young lady .
i warn you , i' m no specialist .
at one time everyone here was catholic .
like in spain or ireland .
at a very precise moment in 1966 , in fact the churches suddenly emptied out , in a few months .
a very strange phenomenon that has yet to be explained .
so now we don' t know what to do with this .
the authorities would like to find out if it has any value .
commercial value ?
yes .
do you have any 18th centuary french cahlices ?
the americans snapped them up .
there are a few examples in the museums .
i' m sure this has great value for people here , the collective memory .
but is there anything that we could sell ?
on the world market ?
honestly , i can' t imagine it .
in other words , this is all absolutely worthless .
i' il show you out .
pius xii sitting on his ass in his gilded vatican while primo levi was taken to auschwitz ...
that' s not sad !
it' s despicable !
hideous !
if what you say true , and history is a series of abominable crimes , then someone has to exist who can forgive us .
that' s my belief .
i envy you .
if at least i' d written .
you wrote nothing ?
a few papers here and there , nothing serious .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
it bugs me .
what would you have written ?
the gulag archipelago , the periodic table .
really , in that class ?
never .
so ?
at least i' d have left a mark .
we need to succeed , even on our own terms .
to be a able to say we did our best .
it allows us to die at peace .
i' m a total failure .
at least you realize it .
so many professors are smug , unbearable .
i don' t know your daughter , but sebastien' s not exactly a failure .
not thanks to me .
you don' t know that .
we thought we' d pay a visit .
everyone wonders how you are .
not everyone , surely .
you' d be surprised .
that last day in class no one seemed very moved .
we had no idea at the time .
exactly .
now that you' re gone ...
we see what we' re missing .
i' m touched to hear that .
sincerely .
we should be going .

it' s ridiculous .
my parents divorced when i was 3 .
for several years dad continued to come over for sunday lunch .
half an hour before he left , i' d vanish .
i' d be lying on the ground in front of his car so he couldn' t leave .
my kids won' t go through that .
so now my nocturnal pleasures are provided by my giant screen toshiba at the foot of my bed .
no more curled up toes ?
that' s over .
i' ve seen enough ceilings .

yes , but we had a fight .
i' il never understand men .
all my life i date cads who thought only of escaping after satisfying their base needs .
to think we can still have sexual flings at our age .
he was incensed .
he doesn' t want to be a sex object , talks about his masculinity .
we love that !
invokes father hunger goes on about exploring his feminine side , his inner me .
it was unbearable .
the last thing i want is a limp dicked sentimentalist .
i want to be screwed forcefully .
that' s all .
i' m sensitive and smart enough for two .
a rub down ?
would he like a rub down ?
does the muslim need to bow towards mecca ?
does the carmelite long for the holy species ?

if you screw up , you' re out of the program .
i still can' t come to terms with it .

it' s a law .
the very instant you shut your eyes , millions more will also die .
but i won' t be here anymore .

i' il be gone for good .
if at least i' d learned something .
i feel as helpless as the day i was born .
i haven' t found a meaning .
it' s
i have to search .
i have to keep searching .
we' ve been everything .
separatists , independantists , sovereignists , sovereignty associationists .
at first we were existentialists .
we read sartre and camus .
then fanon , we became anti colonialists .
we read marcuse and became marxists .
marxist leninists .
trotskyists .
maoists .
after solzhenitsyn we changed .
we were structuralists .
situationists .
feminists .
demonstructionists .
is there an " ism " we haven' t worshipped .
cretinism .
god no .
think of guo jing .
who was he ?
an archeologist with a skirt slit to the crotch .
even you remember .
in the 70s , china opens up to the west .
she comes on a cultural exchange .
the university sends its trusty radical , me ...
i enter the dining room of her hotel .
i spot her , and die .
beauty that could melt emperor qin' s 7000 terra cotta warriors .
i order tea , we make small talk .
i can see us doing pekinese lotus .
the szechuan dragon .
to make myself appear intresting ,
your country has achieved so much .
we' re so envious .
your cultural revolution is wonderful !
her lovely black eyes glaze over .
i' m mortified to realize that she' s thinking ,
he' s either a cla agent or the worst cretin in the west .
so much for the lotus and dragon .
for two years she' d cleaned pigsties on a re education farm .
father murdered , mother committed suicide .
and some dumb french canadian who' s seen the films of jean luc godard and read philippe sollers says that the chinese cultural revolution , is wonderful !
cretinism doesn t sink any lower .
voluntary simplicity .
scrambled eggs with ossetra caviar and fresh truffles .
from tuscany .
and to stay in italy , castello banfi excelsus , a modest vintage .
why were we so dumb ?
are we to infer congenital stupidity ?
not at all .
intelligence isn' t an individual trait .
it' s collective , national , intermittent .
oh , a new theory !
athens , 416bc euripides premieres his electra
two rivals attend , sophocles and aristophanes .
and two friends , socrates and plato .
intelligence was there .
leonardo da vinci and michelangelo .
rafaello .
niccolo machiavelli .
philadelphia , usa , 1776 1787 .
declaration of independence and the constitution .
adams , franklin , jefferson , washington , hamilton and madison .
no other country has been so blessed .
i was born in chicoutimi , canada , in 1950 .
it' s a miracle you' re not dumber . in 1950 , everyone was dumb , in athens and chicoutimi .
in italy you' d have supported the red brigades .
now it' s berlusconi .
philadelphia voted george bush .
you see , you' re not that dumb .
intelligence has disappeared , and it can take eons to come back .
from tacitus to dante was what , 11 centuries ?
the arabs kept intelligence alive .
true .
you' re not hungry ?
it won' t go down .
and you ?
no thanks .
i never thought i' d see the day you' d turn down fresh truffles .
alas , that day is here .
a sip of wine ?
drink to my health and tell me how good it is .
i' d like to bow out just like felix faure .
why am i not surprised ?
i can dream .
who was he ?
why ?
oh blessed felix faure , the president of the french republic .
his heart stopped beating , while his mistress the admirable madame steinheil , kneeling before him , bestowed on him the most glorious blowjob of all time .
my god !
she seized him , the would be caesar and he had a seizure !
henceforth madame steinheil was known as the kiss of death .
i should be so lucky !
it' s not our fault if your heart is unstoppable .
i' d like to remind you that at a certain time , i and several others here blew you most heartily , with enough force to capsize a schooner .
what do you know about blowing buoys ?
well , sir , our efforts earned gushing praise .
heavens , that' s hard to swallow .
i' m beat .
go to bed .
aren' t you coming ?
not tonight .
the middle ages , the manuscripts ...
the barbarians , everywhere , tomorrow ...
their prince approaches .
are you trying to be funny ?
i' m scared .
we' il do what you want .
it' s your decision .
know what i want for you ?
to have as fine a son as you .
heard from sylvaine ?
no .
tell her i thought of her .
i love you .
not so long ago i' d have jumped you without asking .
i might have let you .
i suspected as much .
i wasn' t here today .
you didn' t see me .
of course .
this just came in .
on a ship , you call it the evil eye ...
striking a growler an iceberg at night , or a fire from an oil leak ...
it' s been too long since i' ve seen you .
my daddy , my papuschka ,
i' ve have missed you all my life .
tell yourself i' m a happy woman , i' ve found my place .
i don' t know how you did it , but you managed to pass on your lust for life
you and mom raised incredibly strong children .
it' s a miracle really
you know , the first man in a woman' s life is her father .
you' il always be with me .
friends , sharing this modest life with you has been a delight .
i take your smiles with me .
remy , remy ...
the man of my life .
my guardian angel .
it' s a privilege to know you .
the privilege was all mine , miss .
mom doesn' t want to live here .
i don' t need to sell it .
you can move in for now .
if thls be a man
hlstorla and utopla
i love you .
