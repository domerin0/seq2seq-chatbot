there' s a certain allure she has .

i didn' t hear anything .
it' s not what i heard , it' s what i saw .
it' s what i saw .
i saw the look on her face .
every woman recognizes that look .
what' s that look ?
look of total satisfaction .
guy gets a couple missions in latin america , and he' s a julio lglesias .
you know , he' s from lowa , by the way .
you know , he' s from lowa , by the way .

you got the micro gps .
micro ?
this is your spy cam .
this is carlos ' spy cam , and this is my spy cam ?
look at the size of this thing !
size matters .
but in the spy world , it' s reversed .
you want people to say , " look how small and sexy and sleek this is .
not , " how huge this is !
look what he pulled out of his pants .
it' s huge !
people will laugh at me if i pull this out .
is that his escape module ?
yes , it is .
i know , everybody wants to be like carlos .
i don' t want to be like carlos , but i notice ... ... my stuff looks like you can get it from radioshack in 1972 .
yes , it is .
right away .
all right , we' il finish this later .
it' s a good start , though .
kelly robinson , seen here making his typical flamboyant entrance
shouldn' t this be on the weather channel or something ? with a first round knockout of blake " the blade " lirette .
yeah !
57 and 0 , baby !
kelly robinson , baby !
that guy is so annoying .
everybody " hungary " for his showdown ... ... with the european heavyweight king , cedric mills .
you don' t understand how important it is ... ... that i be 58 and 0 .
i' m 57 and 0 right now .
this man gonna be 58 !
that guy is a born jerk .
cheese .

cheese .
alex !
gen. tucker , this is special agent alex scott .
general .
special agent .
i love hearing that .
i was a regular agent a couple weeks ago ... ... and then around christmas , i got promoted to special .
special .
we were going over the op .
we call it the " switchblade .
it was the first electrochromatic invisible stealth aircraft .
but in the hands of the evildoers ... ... it' s an untraceable delivery system for weapons of mass destruction .
arnold gundars .
the boys over at cla have access to his overseas accounts .
the past five days , there' s been a depletion of funds ... ... without reimbursements .
the bastard' s bought the damn plane .
he just hasn' t sold it yet .
i' il get it back , general .
give me a minute .
hot .
are you sure we can' t use carlos ?
no , they all know him .
without plastic surgery , he wouldn' t last five minutes on this case .
that' s a shame .
that carlos is amazing .
this guy ....
you sure about this , mac ?
he' il get the job done .
shouldn' t rachel be here ?
she' s already in budapest setting up .
you' ve worked with her before , right ?
i have but not in a stakeout situation .
this mission doesn' t call for a stakeout .
it wouldn' t hurt to keep our options open .
the european middleweight championship ... ... is being held in budapest in two days .
gundars is a boxing fanatic .
he' s throwing a party the night before .
okay .
classic stakeout scenario , right ?
no , alex .
no stakeout .
this is more about hacking and tracking .
now , take a look at this guest list .
you got to be kidding .
this is like a who' s who of international bad guys .
obviously , gundars is using this party as cover to auction the plane .
your mission is to get into his palace ... ... find out where the plane is and stop him from selling it .
with these heavy hitters in one place , security' s gonna be insane .
exactly .
the way we see it , there' s only one shot to get you in there .
stakeout ?
no .
we' ve arranged cover .
you' il be working with a civilian to secure entry .
a civilian ?
57 and 0 .
gonna be 58 and 0 .
you know how kelly robinson do .
listen to me now .
i don' t care what gen. patton says .
we don' t need to do it this way .
i think if
i kicked ass all around the world .
for crying out loud .

he gives me a headache

we should keep that down .
i ain' t no fool .
i ain' t tell them who you was .
i said i had to take care of the president' s retarded nephew .
what ?
yeah , they think you' re a retard .
all you do is get some drool , a helmet and zip your jacket up .

yeah , go ahead .
what' s up ?

too many brothers standing around .
we' re getting off on the wrong foot .
you think you' re the harlem globetrotters ... ... and i' m the team that looks like an idiot .

it won' t get irritating until 11 : 00 ... ... because that' s when i' m showing up for your little party .
okay .
excuse me , gents .
i can' t risk that .
the party could clear out by 11 : 00 .

but if you let go of my arm ... ... i' m gonna go across and wax that ass .
you are a spy right now .
i can' t have you running off ... ... with a strange hungarian woman .
i' m kelly robinson .
going off with a strange woman is what i do .
mind your own business .
have a good evening , all right ?
i' m just jealous .
i know , but she chose kelly .
i' il hit it once for you , all right ?
see if she' s got a sister .
if so , it' il be the three of us .
why don' t you go see the city ?
what you say your name was ?
are you going to scream it ?
i will scream your name if i know it .
i had a couple of interesting situations where ....
what happened ?
the girl tried to press charges
hey , slow it down !
i got a lady over here .
hey , that' s some serious road rage .
what' s up , man ?
what' s all this ?
how long have you been working for the u. s. government ?
i work for kelly robinson .
there was bns agent on your jet .
i don' t know .
who was he ?
you' ve been reading spy novels .
maybe we should cut off his penis .
cut off my penis ?
what happened to " rough the man up " ?
cut it off !
wait a second !
you ain' t cutting off nobody' s penis !
i' il answer all your questions , but
who' s the agent ?
i' m not sure if he' s an agent .
who' s the agent ?
i don' t know if he' s an agent or not !
he' s 5 foot 9 .
blond hair  his name ?
i' m not sure , but he' s very annoying .
he' s definitely a bns agent .
his name ?
y' all got these knives and guns pointing at me , so i' m blocking !
he got one of them white names .
alan or ....
take off his pants .
why you gonna take my pants off ?
please don' t cut off kelly robinson' s penis .

kelly !
kelly , shoot her !

i' m sorry , i' m being rude .
special agent rachel wright .
nice to officially meet you .
you' re a spy !
don' t tell anyone .
you' re all bns ?
it' s all bns .
big fan , mr. robinson !
crazy way of showing it .
god , alex , you been working out ?
yeah , a little .
why ?
you just got buff .
just doing curls .
two , three drops of me come out of this .
alex wanted to test you before we put you in the game .
so this whole thing was a big test ?
unbelievable .
that was great .
really ?
really .
oh , cool .
guys , excuse us for a second .
yeah .
hey , good job .
nice work , nice work .
good .
i have seen hundreds of agents ... ... put through that exercise , and i' ve never seen it handled so well .
never .
never .
yeah .
well , kelly robinson .
it was like your instincts were perfect .
give them unimportant information .
like he' s blond , 5' 9 " .
how many guys fit that description ?
that doesn' t mean anything .
you' d never name names .
you know what you are ?
you' re a " why not " guy , not a " why " guy .
what' s the difference ?
why are we gonna do this ?
they' re afraid to make a decision .
afraid they might get in trouble .
as opposed to a " why not " guy .
he' s like , " roll the dice .
that' s me .
kelly robinson .
the " why not " guys are like eagles .
they don' t flock .
the few , the proud , the " why not .
the president wouldn' t have called me if i wasn' t a " why not " guy .
let me see everything .
now , kelly , we gotta get you up to speed .
you' re about to hear a national secret .
this is arnold gundars , premier arms dealer .
he has this plane ... ... the switchblade .
it' s a sophisticated prototype stolen from the u. s. government .
this is the next generation of stealth technology .
undetectable to radar , infrared , even the human eye .
our mission is to get it back .
to make a long story short ... ... we can' t find it , because we can' t see it .
here it is with the electrochromatic cloaking device engaged .
like one of those bugs that look like a leaf .
one of the who ?
there' s this bug that ... ... stays safe because it looks like a leaf .
but it' s not really a leaf .
it can make itself look like one .
a leafy bug .
it' s a good name for it .
you should call that the " leafy bug " .
that' s a good idea .
i' il pass that on .
the leafy bug .
we gotta go .
we' il be late for the mission .
it' s almost 8 : 00 .
you owe me one belt .
yamaguchi .
hey , you got a cell phone ?
tuxedo .
i' m gonna set that all up .
hey , alex , i' m sorry i kneed you and roughed you up in there .
you okay ?
my gosh , don' t be ridiculous .
i thought that was great .
when you kneed me , i loved that .
you did ?
you loved that ?
i just felt it helped sell it .
made it convincing .
wait to turn this on .
the satellite' s only good for the next 72 hours .
let' s hope that' s more than we need .
all right , set us up .
you know the drill .
hey , what' s in that bag ?
spy stuff .
always have a sure way out .
hey , rachel .
what' s up ?
it' s weird .
it feels like a stakeout , doesn' t it ?
no .
not really .
and we are live .
hey , what' s that for ?
this is how i' m gonna break this case wide open with your help .
it' s a replica of the pen gundars carries .
there' s an ihb tracking device built in .
technology .
if alex can plant it on him , we can follow his movements .
okay .
let' s do this , then .
nice shifting , rachel .
these stick shifts can be a little tricky .
you make it look easy .
thank you .
please tell me you didn' t say , " nice shifting .
don' t worry about it .
you really like that girl , huh ?
rachel ?
no .
yes , you do .
mr. robinson !
hey .

hey .
i am very big fan .

i' m with the boxer .
i' ve never seen that man before .

that' s the whole point , isn' t it ?
that you can' t see it .
that' s what you' re buying , isn' t it ?
that' s true .
thank you .
wait a second .
come on .
is that ... ?
please .
finally !
well .
now you' il believe me when i tell you ... ... that you' ve driven past it half a dozen times .
it is the most incredible thing i have ever seen .
shall we conclude our business ?
gentlemen , to the center of the ring .
i explained the instructions in the dressing room .
you' re both professional fighters .
i expect you to conduct yourself professionally .
shake hands .
you ready to do this ?
let' s do it .
it looks like my computer is a billion dollars healthier .
which makes you the proud owner ... ... of the most advanced piece of weaponry on the planet .
watch this .
the ignition code .
round one for the super middleweight ...
... championship of the world !
cedric , come on .
do you want the swelling on the left or right ?
mills goes right to work .
left hand up !
left hand up !
he' s spun around by
what are you doing ?
i' m working .
that looks like an old fashioned thermonuclear warhead .
it' s a bit primitive , isn' t it ?
they won' t think so in washington .
tell your men to drop their guns .
tell them !
do as he says .
get your hands up !
you too , mr. zhu tam .
do it !
you didn' t think you could fool bns , did you ?

you certainly do .
you really should have caught it .

i guess i was a little distracted by the sound of my heart breaking .
code invalid .
that' s not good .
is that good ?
what the hell did you do ?
i entered the ignition code .
self destruct sequence activated .
it has a self destruct mechanism if the wrong code is entered .
no , that is the correct code .
i saw lt. percy fire the engine myself .

i assume you know the correct code .
assumptions have a way of coming back and kicking you in your ass .
robinson measuring mills up .
a wicked left hook by robinson .

that' s what i' m doing .
i was on my way to do it .

mr. zhu tam , i believe .
carlos , careful .
rachel' s a double agent !

she' s saying she' s good ?
i gotta hear this .
this should be rich .
we' ve suspected carlos was dirty for months .
mac and me teamed up with him so we could nail him .
why didn' t they tell me ?
you know how this works .
it' s all on a need to know basis .
you know that .
mac didn' t want you protecting me at the wrong time .
that' s all carlos would have needed .
he' s jealous of us .
he is ?
if he knew how we felt

bitch is sneaky .
she' il kick you .
he' s always known i wanted to work with you .

didn' t i tell you that bitch was bad ?
why didn' t you keep an eye on her ?
you said she was good !

i' m delusional !
you said yourself i' m booty blind .
i' m blinded by ass .

why you gotta throw them around here , then ?
no , it' s okay .
it' s not armed .
can you imagine if this had gone off ?
this would have killed millions !
and they didn' t arm it ?
they didn' t get a chance to .
