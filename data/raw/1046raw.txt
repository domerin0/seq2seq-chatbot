oh , la !
ya didn' t know it was loaded .
sylvie !
oh .
can' t he do something constructive , like start an avalanche or something ?
vas jouer , mon chri .
when you start to eat like this , something is the matter .
sylvie , i' m getting a divorce .
what ?
from charles ?
he' s the only husband i have .
i' ve tried to make it work , really i have , but ...
but what ?
oh , i can' t explain .
i' m too miserable to go on any longer like this .
it is infuriating that your unhappiness does not turn to fat .
but i don' t understand .
why do you want a divorce ?
because i don' t love him .
and he obviously doesn' t love me .
that' s no reason to get a divorce .
with a rich husband and this year' s clothes , you won' t find it difficult to make some new friends .
i admit i came to paris to escape american provincial , but that doesn' t mean i' m ready for french traditional .
i loathe the whole idea of divorce , sylvie .
but if only charles had been honest with me .
the simple truth .
but with charles , everything is secrecy and lies .
he' s hiding something from me , sylvie ... something terrible ... and it frightens me .
does he belong to you ?
it' s hers .
where' d you find him ?
robbing a bank ?
he was throwing snowballs at baron rothschild .
oh , thank you .
do we know each other ?
do you think we' re going to ?
how would i know ?
because i already know an awful lot of people .
until one of them dies i couldn' t possibly meet anyone else .
hmm .
well , if anyone goes on the critical list let me know .
quitter .
beg pardon ?
you give up awfully easily , don' t you ?
jean louis , let us walk .
i' ve never seen a rothschild before .
clever fellow .
almost missed me .
thank you .
you' re blocking my view .
oh .
which view would you prefer ?
the one you' re blocking .
it' s my last chance .
i' m flying back to paris this afternoon .
what' s your name ?
peter joshua .
mine' s regina lampert .
is there a mr. lampert ?
yes .
good for you .
no .
i' m getting a divorce .
please , not on my account .
no .
i don' t really love him .
at least you' re honest .
hmm .
is there a mrs. joshua ?
yes , but we' re divorced .
that wasn' t a proposal .
i' m just curious .
is your husband with you ?
oh , no , charles is never with me .
what do people call you ?
pete ?
mr. joshua .
i' ve enjoyed talking with you .
now you' re angry .
no , i just have a lot of packing to do .
i' m going back to paris too .
wasn' t it shakespeare who said when strangers meet in far off lands ... they should ere long see each other again ?
shakespeare never said that .
how do you know ?
it' s terrible .
you just made it up .
well , it sounds right .
you going to call me ?
are you in the book ?
charles is .
is there only one charles lampert ?
mmm .
lord , i hope so .
good bye , sylvie , and thanks .
when you get your divorce are you going back to america ?
don' t you want me to stay ?
of course , but if you went back and wrote me a letter ...
you could have the stamps .
i' il get you some here , okay ?
okay .
good bye .
merci .
honorine ?
honorine !
aaaah !
madame charles lampert ?
yes .
i' m inspector edouard grandpierre of the police judiciaire .
would you be so kind as to come with me , please ?
well , madame ?
you are positive ?
you loved him ?
i' m very cold .
we discovered your husband' s body ...
lying next to the tracks of the paris bordeaux railroad line .
he was dressed only in his pyjamas .
do you know any reason he might have wanted to leave france ?
leave ?
no .
your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the maranguape .
it sailed for venezuela this morning at 7 : 00 .
i' m very confused .
he was american , your husband ?
swiss .
ah , swiss .
his profession ?
he didn' t have one .
he was a wealthy man ?
i suppose so .
i don' t know .
about how wealthy , would you say ?
i don' t know .
where did he keep his money ?
i don' t know .
besides yourself , who is his nearest relative ?
i don' t know .
that' s absurd , madame !
totalement absurde .
i know .
i' m sorry .
it is all right ?
i wish you wouldn' t .
les effets lampert .
d' accord .
wednesday last your husband sold the contents of the apartment at public auction .
everything .
the gallery paid him 1, 250, 000 new francs ... in dollars , a quarter of a million .
the authorities in bordeaux searched his compartment on the train .
they searched it thoroughly .
they did not find $250000 .
these few things are all that was found in the train compartment .
there was no other baggage .
your husband must have been in a great hurry .
one wallet containing 4, 000 francs .
one agenda .
his last notation was made yesterday , thursday ... 5 : 00 p . m . , jardin de champs elyses .
why there ?
i don' t know .
perhaps he met somebody .
obviously .
one ticket of passage to south america .
one letter , stamped but unsealed , addressed to you .
may i see it , please ?
my dear regina , i hope you are enjoying your holiday .
megeve can be so lovely at this time of year .
the days pass very slowly and i hope to see you soon .
as always , charles .
p. s. your dentist called yesterday .
your appointment has been changed .
not much , is it ?
we took the liberty of calling your dentist .
we thought perhaps we would learn something .
did you ?
yes .
your appointment has been changed .
one key to your apartment .
one comb .
one fountain pen .
one toothbrush .
one tin of tooth powder .
that is all .
if you will sign this list , you may take the things with you .
is that all ?
may i leave now ?
one more question .
is this your husband' s passport ?
yes .
and this ?
i don' t understand .
and this ?
and this ?
oh , i telephoned but nobody answered .
hello .
hello .
i wanted to tell you how sorry i am and see if there' s anything i can do .
how did you find out ?
it' s in the afternoon papers .
i' m very sorry .
thank you .
i pressed the bell but it isn' t ringing , i guess .
i know .
there' s no electricity .
well , where did everything go ?
charles sold it at auction .
this is all i have left .
i love this room , but charles never saw it ... only the things in it .
i think i prefer it this way .
what are you going to do ?
try and get my job back at e. u. r. e. s. c. o. , i suppose .
doing what ?
i' m a simultaneous translator , like sylvie .
only she' s english into french and i' m french into english .
that' s what i was doing before i married charles .
the police probably think i killed him .
instant divorce , " you mean ?
something like that .
it' s terrible to end it this way , though ... tossed off a train like a sack of third class mail .
well , come on .
you can' t stay here .
i don' t know where to go .
we' il find you a hotel .
nothing too expensive .
i' m not a lady of leisure anymore , you know .
something clean and modest and near enough to e. u. r. e. s. c. o ... so you can take a cab when it rains .
okay ?
okay .
not a very large turnout , is it ?
didn' t charles have any friends ?
don' t ask me .
i' m only the widow .
if charles had died in bed , we wouldn' t even have him .
at least he knows how to behave at funerals .
have you no idea who could have done it ?
until two days ago the only thing i really knew about charles was his name .
now it seems i didn' t even know that .
he must have known charles pretty well .
how can you tell ?
he' s allergic to him .
bless you .
do you know him ?
never seen him before .
arrivederci , " charlie .
miz lampert , ma' am ...
uh , miz lampert , ma' am ,
charlie had no call of doin ' it that a way .
no siree .
what next ?
mi pardon , madame .
merci .
pardon .
pardon .
pardon .
pardon .
who' s it from ?
the american embassy .
i bluffed the old man out of the last pot with a pair of deuces .
what' s so depressing about that ?
well , if i can do it , what are the russians doing to him ?
hello ?
hello ?
is there anything wrong , miss tompkins ?
uh , miss tompkins isn' t here .
oh , i' m sorry .
my secretary must have gone to lunch .
uh , you are ...
mrs. charles lampert .
oh , yes .
please , uh , come in , mrs. lampert .
excuse me for a moment , mrs. lampert .
it' s a stubborn little devil .
dry cleaning wise , things are all fouled up .
i had a really excellent man on the rue ponthieu , but h. q. asked us to use the plant here in the building ... to ease the gold outflow .
mr. bartholomew , are you quite sure you know who i am ?
you' re charles lampert' s widow , yes ?
i' m very sorry .
last time i sent out a tie , only the spot came back .
voila , as they say .
won' t you sit down , mrs. lampert ?
i' ve got something here .
i' ve got liverwurst , liverwurst , chicken and liverwurst .
no , thank you .
mrs. lampert , do you know what c. i. a. is ?
i don' t suppose it' s an airline , is it ?
central intelligence agency .
c. i. a.
you mean spies and all of that ?
only we call them agents .
" we " ?
you mean you ...
someone has to do it , mrs. lampert .
i didn' t think people like you were supposed to admit ...
oh , i' m not an agent .
i' m an administrator , a desk jockey ... trying to run a bureau of overworked men with underallocated ...
funds .
congress seems to think that all a spy needs ...
agent .
yes .
that all he needs is a code book , a cyanide pill and he' s in business .
what' s all this got to do with me , mr. bartholomew ?
your husband was wanted by the united states government .
may i have a sandwich , please ?
chicken or liverwurst ?
chicken .
to be more specific , your husband was wanted by this agency .
so that was it .
yes .
we , of course , knew him by his real name ...
voss .
charles voss .
all right , mrs. voss .
i' d like you to look at this photograph for a moment , please .
tell us if you recogni ...
oh .
by the way , have you seen this one ?
scott , cathy and ham jr .
very sweet .
aren' t they ?
all right , mrs. voss ...
please stop calling me that .
lampert' s the name on the marriage license .
i' m terribly sorry .
mrs. lampert , would you look at that and tell me if you recognize anyone ?
just a moment .
have a good look .
it' s charles .
very good .
he looks so young .
when was this taken ?
1944 .
next , please .
the man who was at the funeral yesterday .
a tall man in a corduroy suit .
does the name tex penthollow mean anything to you ?
no .
you like some wine ?
no , thank you .
next , please .
he was there too .
a little less hair , but it' s the same one .
do you know him , mrs. lampert ?
leopold w. gideon ?
no .
the last one , please .
that' s a face you don' t forget .
he was there too .
herman scobie .
you' ve never seen him before either ?
no , thank heaven .
mrs. lampert , i' m afraid you are in a great deal of danger .
why should i be in any danger ?
you' re charles voss ' wife .
now that he' s dead you' re their only lead .
mr. bartholomew , if you' re trying to frighten me ... you' re doing a first rate job .
please do what we ask , mrs. lampert .
it' s your only chance .
gladly .
but i don' t know what you want .
you haven' t told me .
oh ?
i haven' t ?
well , it' s the money , mrs. lampert , the money .
the $250, 000 charles voss received from the auction .
those three men want it too .
they want it very badly .
but that' s charles ' money , not theirs .
oh , mrs. lampert , i' d love to see you try and convince them of that .
oh , boy .
but then whose is it ?
his or theirs ?
ours .
oh .
charles voss stole $250, 000 from the united states government .
i' m afraid we want it back .
but i don' t have it .
that' s impossible , mrs. lampert .
you' re the only one who could have it .
mr. bartholomew , if i had a quarter of a million dollars , believe me , i' d know it .
nevertheless , mrs. lampert , you' ve got it .
you mean it' s just lying around somewhere , all that cash ?
or a certified check , safe deposit key , baggage claim .
you look for it , mrs. lampert .
i' m quite sure you' il find it .
but ...
look for it .
look just as hard and as fast as you can .
you may not have a great deal of time .
those three men know you' ve got the money just as surely as we do .
you won' t be safe until the money' s in our hands .
is that clear ?
here' s where you' re to call me , day or night .
it' s a direct line to both my office ...
and my apartment .
and please don' t tell anyone about coming to see us today .
it could prove fatal for them as well as yourself .
as i said , mrs. lampert , i' m afraid you' re in a great deal of danger .
i regret very much having to say this , but ... please remember what happened to your husband .
hello .
hello , peter .
didn' t you telephone me to meet you on that corner over there ?
i' m sorry .
i heard the children laughing .
do you understand french ?
not a word .
i' m still having trouble with english .
the man and the woman are married .
oh , i can see that .
they' re batting each other over the head .
ay , ay , ay !
ooh , la , la , la !
qu' est ce qu' il se passe ?
who' s that with the hat ?
that' s the policeman .
he wants to arrest judy for killing punch .
what' s she saying now ?
that she' s innocent .
she didn' t do it .
oh , she did it , all right .
i believe her .
well , who was that ?
that' s punch , of course .
punch , of course " ?
i thought he was dead .
he' s only pretending , to teach her a lesson .
only he is dead , peter .
i saw him .
he' s not pretending .
somebody threw him off a train .
charles was mixed up in something terrible .
what am i going to do ?
i wish you' d let me help you .
it doesn' t sound like the sort of thing a young woman can handle by herself .
how ' bout making me vice president in charge of cheering you up ?
starting tonight ?
bonsoir , messieurs , dames , ladies and gentlemen , buona sera , signore e signori .
ce soir , comme tous les autres soirs d' ailleurs , vous savez bien ... qui ici au black sheep club , i' attraction , c' est vous !
alors , approchez vous , messieurs , dames , venez ici , step right up , ladies and gentlemen ,
what' s going on ?
fun and games .
evidently we' re the floor show .
come on .
you and me ?
everyone .
avanti , avanti , signore e signori .
ecoutez moi bien .
ah , coutez moi .
alors , il y a deux quipes .
there are two teams , et pour chaque quipe , il y a une orange .
for every team there is one orange .
una aranja .
vous mettez i' orange sur le menton comme a ... put the orange in like so .
vous passez i' orange la personne derrire vous ...
you pass the orange to the person behind you , mais sans utilisez les mains .
without the use of your hands .
are you ready ?
uno , due , tre ...
mrs. lampert , who are you ?
didn' t charles tell you , mrs. lampert ?
tell me what ?
it doesn' t belong to you .
you do know that , don' t you ?
i don' t know anyth ...
mrs. lampert !
any morning now you could wake up dead , mrs. lampert .
leave me alone !
dead , mrs. lampert .
like charles , mrs. lampert .
stop it !
what' s the trouble ?
he stepped on my foot .
forgive me .
wait here .
i won' t be long .
it was quite unintentional , i' m sure .
mr. bartholomew , this is regina lampert .
i just saw one of those m ...
mr. bartholomew , can you hear me ?
mr. bartholomew , this is regina lampert .
i just ...
howdy .
what do you want ?
you must be kiddin ' .
no , i' m not .
come on now , miz lampert .
you know what it is , and you' re gonna get it for me too .
' cause you know i ain' t foolin ' around here .
no siree bob .
stop that , please !
now , don' t make too much noise , miz lampert .
it could get a whole lot worse , you know .
it belongs to me , miz lampert , and you' re gonna get it for me ,
or your life ain' t gonna be worth the paper it' s printed on .
you understand what i' m sayin ' to you ?
stop !
please stop !
you go home and think it over real careful like , you hear ?
you' re absolutely insane !
aaaaah !
what' s the matter ?
what are you doing in here ?
i' m having a nervous breakdown .
now hold it .
i' ve waited long enough .
what happened back there ?
i' m not sure if i' m supposed to tell you or not .
what does that mean ?
he said if i told anybody ... it could prove fatal for them as well as me .
who said ?
that' s what i' m not supposed to say .
eh ...
now stop that nonsense .
stop bullying me .
everybody' s bullying me .
i' m not bullying you .
yes , you were .
you said it was nonsense .
being murdered in cold blood is not nonsense .
why don' t you try it sometime ?
would you mind seeing me to the door ?
of course not .
it' s a good place for making friends .
you said this afternoon your husband was mixed up in something .
how do you shave in there ?
what was it ?
what was what ?
what your husband was mixed up in .
look , i know it' s asking you to stretch your imagination , but don' t you think ... you could pretend just for a moment that i' m a woman ?
i could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor .
here you are .
where ?
on the street where you live .
how about once more around the park ?
how about getting out of here ?
come on , child .
out .
won' t you come in for a minute ?
no , i won' t .
i don' t bite , you know , unless it' s called for .
how would you like a spanking ?
how' d you like a punch in the nose ?
stop treating me like a child .
well , then stop behaving like one .
if you want to tell me what' s troubling you , fine .
if not , i' m tired , it' s late and i want to go home to bed .
oh ...
do you know what' s wrong with you ?
no .
what ?
nothing .
aaaah !
where is it , lady ?
i don' t know .
i want it .
you give it to me .
it' s mine !
aaaaah !
peter !
peter !
a man tried to kill me !
what ?
peter ?
peter ?
peter , are you all right ?
oh , peter .
are you hurt ?
mm hmm .
i sprained my pride .
how are you ?
scared .
you' il be all right .
where did he go ?
out the window , i guess .
lock the door , and don' t let anyone in except me .
and close these windows after me .
be careful .
you took the words right out of my mouth .
alistair !
what is it now , pamela ?
it happened again !
another strange man peered in the window at me but then went away .
bad luck , pamela .
that was a dumb move , herman .
oh , man .
and then some .
if you' d let us know you was goin ' to her room ... we could have done somethin ' to keep him busy .
but sneakin ' up that a way by yourself .
what did you expect him to do ?
walk up and shake you by that hand of yours ?
dumb move , herman .
yes , it was a dumb move , herman .
what is the matter with you ?
you want some more ?
never mind that .
did you get the money ?
how could i with the three marx brothers breathing down my neck ?
i thought we had an agreement .
now , the girl trusts me .
if she' s got the money i' il find out about it .
but you just leave me alone .
we took all the chances .
the money belongs to us , not to him .
now , don' t be piggy , herman .
a third of nothing is nothing .
just think about that .
but make up your mind .
she' s waiting for me .
i don' t see how another 24 hours could hurt anything .
not after all these years .
then he gets it out of your share .
not mine .
not mine !
either one of you got the room next to her ?
yeah , i have .
why ?
get another room .
i want to use it .
hmm .
if you do find that money , you ain' t gonna forget to tell your buddies about it , are you ?
don' t worry .
oh , i ain' t worryin ' .
you see this little fella here ?
oh , he worries .
and he' s even meaner than i am .
who is it ?
it' s me , peter .
there was no trace of him .
why don' t you confide in me and tell me what this is all about ?
there are three men .
he' s one of them .
they think i have a quarter of a million dollars that belongs to them .
go on .
that' s all .
no , it isn' t .
where' s the money ?
i don' t know !
they killed charles to get it , but he must not have had it with him on the train .
so they think he left it with you .
but he didn' t .
i' ve looked everywhere , and if i don' t find it they' re going to kill me .
no , they won' t .
i won' t let them .
peter , help me .
you' re the only one i can trust .
i' il help you .
i told you i would .
come on .
oh , i' m so hungry i could faint .
and i' ve gotten your suit all wet .
that' s all right .
it' s a drip dry .
wipe your eyes .
promise me you' il never lie to me the way charles did .
why do people have to tell lies ?
usually because they want something .
they' re afraid the truth won' t get it .
do you tell lies ?
hello ?
mrs. lampert , it' s me , the man who was in your room a few minutes ago .
what do you want ?
who is it ?
it' s the man you had the fight with .
is dyle with you ?
who ?
the man i had the fight with , lady .
dyle .
that' s his name .
what' s wrong ?
is he still there ?
yes , that' s right .
what' s he saying ?
don' t trust him .
don' t tell him anything .
he' s after the money .
what was all that about ?
he ...
he said if i don' t give him the money he' il kill me .
oh , don' t take it seriously .
he' s just trying to frighten you .
i believe what he said .
no , no .
it' s just a lot of words .
words can hurt .
i know .
try to get some sleep .
you' il feel better .
don' t worry .
i' ve arranged to take the room next door to you .
so you' il be all right .
if you want anything , just bang on the wall .
better lock the door after me .
good night .
i am calm , mr. bartholomew .
what i' m trying to say is that there' s someone else .
what ?
someone who wasn' t in that photograph today .
he says his name is peter joshua , but it isn' t .
it' s dyle .
are you still there , mr. bartholomew ?
yes , yes , mrs. lampert .
i don' t know who this mr. dyle is , but it' s possible we were wrong about who killed your husband .
you mean ... he might have ?
mr. bartholomew , i' m catching the next plane out of here .
i' m not going to sit around for somebody to make chopped liver out of me .
now , take it easy , mrs. lampert .
take it easy .
where are you now ?
can you meet me at the market ?
at les halles ?
yes .
opposite st. eustace .
i' il meet you there in 15 minutes .
all right , i' il be there .
allez vite , n' importe ou .
n' importe ou !
vite !
suivez ce taxi .
were you followed ?
yes , by dyle .
but i lost him .
i' m beginning to think women make the best spies .
agents .
he has a gun , mr. bartholomew .
no .
but i saw it .
no , that' s not carson dyle .
carson ?
there' s only one dyle connected with this affair , mrs. lampert .
that' s carson dyle .
you mean you' ve known about him all along ?
it' s enough to make you a vegetarian , isn' t it ?
it' s just lucky i' m not hanging next to one of those right now .
why didn' t you tell me you knew about dyle ?
i didn' t see any point .
dyle' s dead .
mr. bartholomew , what is all this about ?
in 1944 , five members of the o. s. s ... the military espionage unit ... were ordered behind the german lines ... for the purpose of delivering $250, 000 in gold ... to the french underground .
the five men were your husband charles , the three men at his funeral yesterday ...
and carson dyle .
oh .
but instead of delivering the gold , they stole it .
how ?
by burying it , then reporting the germans had captured it .
all they had to do was come back after the war , dig it up and split it five ways .
quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked .
may i have a cigarette , please ?
i can' t stand those things .
it' s like drinking coffee through a veil .
everything went smoothly enough until after the gold was buried .
before they could get out they were ambushed by a german patrol .
a machine gun separated scobie from his right hand ... and caught carson dyle full in the stomach .
what was wrong with that one ?
nothing , i guess .
what happened then ?
have you any idea what these things cost over here ?
please go on , mr. bartholomew .
what happened then ?
carson dyle was dead , but scobie was able to travel .
so ...
la soupe , c' est pour qui ?
pour moi .
where was i ?
carson dyle was dead .
yes .
the others finally got back to the base and waited for the war to end , only charles couldn' t wait quite as long as the others .
he beat them back to the gold , took everything for himself and disappeared .
it' s taken gideon , tex and scobie all this time to catch up with him again .
but if they stole all that money , why can' t you arrest them ?
shh !
we know what happened from the bits we were able to paste together , but we still have no proof .
what' s this got to do with the c. i. o. ?
c. i. a. , mrs. lampert .
it' s an extension of the wartime o. s. s.
it' s our money and we want it back .
i' m sorry , mr. bartholomew , but nothing you' ve said has changed my mind .
i' m leaving paris tonight .
wouldn' t advise that , mrs. lampert .
better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave .
those men won' t be very far away no matter where you go .
in fact , i don' t even see any point in your changing hotels .
now , please help us , mrs. lampert .
your government is counting on you .
well , if i' m going to die i might as well do it for my country .
that' s the spirit .
here' s what i want you to do .
we' re anxious to know who this man is , the one calling himself dyle .
i want you to find out .
why me ?
you' re in an ideal position .
he trusts you .
besides , you yourself said women make the best spies .
agents .
oh , pardon .
fraulein .
fraulein !
what are you doing following me ?
it' s gonna look like a parade .
stop it !
how are you ?
nice to see you .
when did you arrive ?
it' s a lovely town .
are you having a good time ?
so many things to see .

what do you want to know ?
why you lied to me !
i had to .
for all i knew you were in on the whole thing .
i' m trying to find out who you are .
you know my name .
it' s dyle .
carson dyle is dead .
yes , he is .
he was my brother .
your brother ?
the army thinks he was killed in action by the germans , but i think they did it ...
tex , gideon , scobie and your husband ... because my brother wouldn' t go along with their scheme to steal the gold .
i think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him .
i' m trying to prove it .
they think i' m working with them , but i' m not , reggie .
i' m on your side .
just believe that .
how can i ?
you lied to me just the way charles did .
after promising you wouldn' t .
oh , i want to believe you , peter ...
i can' t call you that anymore , can i ?
take me a while to get used to your new name .
what is it ?
hmm ?
hello ?
hello ?
do anything funny or try to talk to anyone and i' il kill you , dyle .
you' il wreck your raincoat .
take the next car , please .
look out .
didn' t want you to bump your head .
all right , get in there .
all right , turn around .
now sit down .
now what ?
we wait .
with our mouth shut .
oh , i' m sorry about that .
okay .
up there .
do i knock or something ?
no , open it ... and keep right on goin ' .
the view had better be worth it .
very pretty .
now what ?
i was afraid of that .
i' il give you a chance , dyle , which is more than you' d give me .
where' s the money ?
is that why you dragged me all the way up here ?
to ask me that ?
she has it .
and i say maybe you both have it .
one more time , dyle .
where is it ?
supposing i had it ... which i don' t ... do you really think i' d just hand it over to you ?
step back .
back where ?
that' s the idea .
hmm .
n now , just a minute .
take it easy .
herman ?
what ?
how you doing ?
how do you think ?
if you get bored , try writing " love thy neighbor " 100 times on the side of the building .
monsieur , next time , please , use the keyhole , hmm ?
is that you ?
yeah .
you gonna open up ?
sure .
wait a minute .
don' t you know it' s impolite to leave someone holding ... the phone ?
what happened ?
oh , i met a man with sharp nails .
scobie ?
mm hmm .
i left him hanging around the american express .
come in .
i' ve got something that stings like crazy .
you' re the kind of girl that' d have something like that .
sit down .
uh , w w wait a minute .
w w what is that stuff ?
marvelous stuff .
gonna hurt you much more than it' s gonna hurt me .
i' il bet ...
ohh !
did you hear something rip ?
no .
oh .
that' s odd .
listen , i i only came in for an estimate .
sit still .
it' s not too bad .
you won' t be able to lie on your back for a few days .
but then , you can lie from any position , can' t you ?
oh ho ho ...
ooooh !
does it hurt ?
what ?
does it hurt ?
ohh !
are you kidding ?
have you got a bullet i could bite , like they do in the movies ?
are you really carson dyle' s brother ?
would you like to see my passport ?
passport ?
what kind of a proof is that ?
well , would you like to see where i was tattooed ?
yes .
all right , we' il drive around that way .
you could at least tell me what your first name is these days .
alexander .
okay , alexander .
you' re done .
good .
you' re a new man .
i' m sorry the old one couldn' t tell you the truth , but i had to find out your part in all this .
is there a mrs. dyle ?
yes , but we' re divorced .
i thought that was peter joshua .
i' m just as difficult to live with as he was .
alex , how can you tell if anyone' s lying or not ?
you can' t .
there must be some way .
there' s an old riddle about two tribes of indians .
the whitefeet always tell the truth and the blackfeet always lie .
one day you meet an indian , you say ,
hey , indian , what are you , a truthful whitefoot or a lying blackfoot ?
he says , " i' m a truthful whitefoot .
but which is he ?
why couldn' t you just look at his feet ?
because he' s wearing moccasins .
well , then , he' s a truthful whitefoot , of course .
why not a lying blackfoot ?
which one are you ?
a truthful whitefoot .
come in .
sit down .
why ?
do you wanna look at my feet ?
yes .
uh ...
ohh .
hey , knock it off .
come on , reggie , listen to me .
here it comes , the fatherly talk .
you forget i' m already a widow .
so was juliet , at 15 .
but i' m not 15 .
well , that' s your trouble ... you' re too old for me .
can' t you be serious ?
oh !
you just said an horrible word .
what did i say ?
serious .
when a man gets to be my age , that' s the last word he ever wants to hear .
i don' t want to be serious , and i especially don' t want you to be .
okay , we' il just sit around all day being frivolous .
how about that , hmm ?
reggie , cut it out .
okay .
now what are you doing ?
cutting it out .
who told you to do that ?
you did .
i' m not through complaining yet .
oh .
now cut it out .
alex , i think i love you .
hey , the telephone' s ringing .
never mind .
whoever it is won' t give up , and neither will i.
just a minute .
go on , take it .
hello .
i' m sorry , uh ...
i was just , uh ... nibbling on something .
say , i' d appreciate it mighty highly ... if you' d , uh , wiggle on over to room 46 and chew the fat for a spell .
give me one reason why i should .
yeah .
a little one , about six or seven .
keeps callin ' for aunt reggie .
ain' t that cute ?
they' ve got jean louis .
i' il be right there .
hey , tex , do somethin ' with this kid , will ya ?
my leg' s goin ' to sleep .
upsy daisy .
are you a real cowboy ?
yeah , sure i am , kid .
so where' s your gun ?
will you put that thing away !
jean louis .
howdy , miz lampert .
who invited him ?
well , herman , i see you had a happy landing .
i must call sylvie right away .
i' m afraid that' il have to wait , mrs. lampert .
it' s his mother .
she won' t be anybody' s mother unless you answer some questions .
this ain' t no game , miz lampert .
we want that money now .
why don' t you keep quiet and stop threatening the child .
he hasn' t got the money , and neither has mrs. lampert .
then who does ?
i don' t know , herman .
maybe you do .
me ?
or you .
ohh !
or him .
why , that' s the most ridiculous thing i ever ...
listen to this man .
man' s gone loco .
now hold it .
suppose one of you found charles here in paris .
even bumped into him by accident , followed him when he tried to run out again , cornered him on the train , threw him out the window and , without bothering to tell the other two , took all the money for yourself .
if one of us did that , he wouldn' t hang around waiting for the other two to figure it out .
but he' d have to .
don' t you see ?
if he left , he' d be admitting his guilt .
whoever it is has to wait here pretending to look for the money , waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home .
he' s just tryin ' to throw us off .
they got it , i tell ya .
why don' t we search their rooms ?
that' s all right with us .
then what are we wastin ' time for ?
let' s go .
while we' re waiting , we' il search yours .
not my room !
well , herman .
you have something to hide ?
then there are no objections .
all right , here' s my key .
i' il take that .
my room' s open .
everyone .
whoa .
come on .
now , you two just make yourselves to home here .
well , let' s get busy .
come on , jean louis .
come on .
oh , that' s fine .
who gets your vote ?
scobie .
he' s the one who objected .
all right , i' il take tex' s room here and gideon' s .
you take jean louis with you , and bolt the door from inside .
come on , jean louis .
we' il have a treasure hunt .
tex ?
man , that' s charlie' s stuff .
looks like it .
think we ought to call herman ?
what for ?
if it' s not here , why bother him ?
and if it is ?
why bother him ?
oh .
what ?
sure there' s nothing missing here ?
no , everything' s here .
the police have kindly provided us with a list .
sure ain' t nothin ' here worth no quarter of a million dollars .
not unless we' re blind .
i keep telling myself we' ve stolen a great deal of money , but up to now i' ve yet to see a penny of it .
you think maybe we' re fishin ' up the wrong stream ?
meaning what ?
suppose one of us has it .
you know , like the man says .
now , that' d be mighty distasteful , us bein ' veterans of the same war and all .
well , you know i' d tell you if i had it .
naturally .
just like i' d tell you if i had it .
naturally .
and that goes for herman too .
naturally .
he' s all right , sylvie .
honestly .
just hurry over as soon as you can .
okay .
good bye .
now , if you had a treasure , where would you hide it ?
i would bury it in the garden .
swell , but this man doesn' t have a garden .
oh , neither do i.
you don' t ?
well , if you had to hide it in this room , where would you put it ?
up there .
on top of that cupboard ?
you know something ?
you may be right .
oh , i hope i don' t find any hairy little things living up here .
hey , there is something .
and it' s heavy .
i found it !
i found it !
i found it !
if you think you' re getting credit for this , you' re crazy .
we won !
we won !
we won !
we won !
we won !
we won !
we won !
we found it !
we found it !
did you find it ?
no .
what do you mean , no ?
the kid was yellin ' .
up there .
it' s up there .
believe me , there' s nothing up there .
yeah ?
oh !
oh !
jumpin ' frijoles .
it' s herman' s spare .
where is he ?
he' s over in my room .
you' d better take the boy out in the hall .
oh , now , who would' ve done a mean thing like that ?
i' m not quite sure .
well , this ain' t my room .
mine neither .
oh , the police aren' t going to like this a bit .
we could dry him off and take him down the hall to his own room .
he really doesn' t look too bad .
oh , poor old herman .
seems like him and good luck always was strangers .
well , maybe now he' il meet up with his other hand someplace .
a man drowned in his bed ?
impossible .
and in his pyjamas ... the second one in his pyjamas .
c' est trop stupide .
stop lying to me .
this nose tells me when you are lying .
it is never mistaken , not in 23 years .
this nose will make me commissaire of police .
mr. dyle , or mr. joshua ...
which is it ?
dyle .
and yet you registered in megeve as mr. joshua .
didn' t you know it was against the law to register under an assumed name ?
no , i didn' t .
it' s done in america all the time .
none of you will be permitted to leave paris ... until this matter is cleared up .
only i warn you , i will be watching .
we use the guillotine in this country .
i have always suspected that the blade coming down ... causes no more than a slight tickling sensation ... on the back of the neck .
it is only a guess , of course .
i hope none of you ever finds out for certain .
who do you think did it ?
gideon ?
possibly .
or tex ?
possibly .
you' re a fat lot of help .
that' s right .
can i have one of those ?
what ?
i think tex did it .
oh .
vanille et chocolat , s' il vous plait .
why do you think tex did it ?
because i really suspect gideon , and it' s always the person you don' t suspect .
do women think it feminine to be so illogical , or can' t they help it ?
what' s so illogical about that ?
you just said it' s always the one you don' t suspect .
if you suspect gideon , therefore it must be tex .
on the other hand , if you suspect tex it must be the other fella , gideon .
i guess they just can' t help it .
hmm ?
who ?
women .
oh .
you know , i can' t help feeling rather sorry for scobie .
wouldn' t it be nice if we were like that ?
what , like scobie ?
no .
gene kelly .
you remember when he danced down here by the river in an american in paris ... without a care in the world ?
mmm .
you know , this is good .
want some ?
uh ...
ohh !
no , thanks .
i guess you don' t either .
here , give me that .
i' m sorry .
alex , i' m scared .
yes , i know .
i can' t think of any reason why he was killed .
well , perhaps someone thought that four shares were too many .
what makes you think that this someone is going to be satisfied with three ?
he wants it all .
that means we' re in his way too .
that' s right .
we' ve got to do something .
i mean , any minute now we could be assassinated .
would you do anything like that ?
what , assassinate someone ?
no .
swing down from there on a rope to save the woman you love .
like the hunchback of notre dame .
uh ...
huh ?
who put that there ?
hurry up and change .
i' m starved .
let me know what you want to eat so i can pick out a suit that matches .
ha ha ha ha .
ah ah ah !
what do you want ?
it' s the house detective .
why don' t you have a girl in there ?
god , you' re a pest .
can i come in ?
no .
i' m going to take a bath .
wouldn' t it be better if you did it in here ?
what for ?
well , i wouldn' t want to use that tub .
anyway , i don' t want to be alone .
i' m afraid .
you' re only next door .
if anything happens , holler .
aaaah !
reggie ?
got you .
ha ha .
did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf ?
the shower' s in there .
oh , come on , open the door .
this is a ludicrous situation .
i can think of a dozen men who are just longing to use my shower .
why don' t you call one of them ?
i dare you .
oh , you' re a nut .
what are you doing ?
taking off my shoes .
did you ever hear of anyone taking a shower with their shoes on ?
i usually sing a medley of old favorites when i' m in the shower .
any requests ?
shut the door .
i' m afraid i don' t know that one , miss .
well ...
shut the door !
why ?
come in and watch .
drip dry .
how often do you go through this little ritual ?
oh , every day .
the manufacturer recommends it .
i don' t believe it .
oh , yes , it' s ...
wait a minute .
read the label .
look at the small print .
wearing this suit during washing ... helps protect its shape .
whoo !
ha ha !
waterproof .
ah ha ha ha ha .
wait .
acro nylon .
fibrous resistant .
plastic .
rustproof .
fireproof .
proof proof .
you' re the nut .
nut proof !
yes ?
mrs. lampert ?
bartholomew .
i spoke to washington , mrs. lampert .
go ahead , mr. bartholomew .
i' m listening .
well , i told them what you said about this man being carson dyle' s brother .
i asked them what they knew about it , and they told me .
you' re not gonna like this , mrs. lampert .
carson dyle had no brother .
mrs. lampert ?
are you sure there' s no mistake ?
none whatsoever .
please be careful , mrs. lampert .
bye .
i left all my drip dry dripping .
is that all right ?
what' s the matter ?
is something wrong ?
you' re probably weak from hunger .
you' ve only eaten five times today .
i' il fix up my suit and take you out to dinner .
let' s go somewhere crowded .
i feel like a lot of people .
hey , you know , this thing is still damp .
you haven' t spoken a word for 20 minutes .
i was thinking about charles and scobie and who' s going to be next .
me ?
i don' t suppose you know who the murderer is , do you ?
no .
not yet .
whoever' s left alive at the end will pretty much have sewn up the nomination .
what are you trying to say , that i might have killed charles and scobie ?
what do i have to do to satisfy you ?
become the next victim ?
it' s a start , anyway .
oh .
i can' t understand you at all .
one minute you' re chasing me around the shower room .
the next minute you' re accusing me of murder .
carson dyle had no brother .
oh , i can explain that , if you' il just listen .
well , i can' t very well leave without a pair of water wings , can i ?
all right , get set for the story of my life .
fiction or nonfiction ?
eh ...
why don' t you shut up ?
well !
are you going to listen ?
go on .
all right .
now , when i was a young man my father expected me to go into his business .
umbrella frames .
that' s what he made .
a sensible business , i suppose , but i didn' t have the sense in those days to be sensible .
i suppose all this is leading somewhere .
well , it led me away from umbrella frames , for one thing .
but that left me without any honest means of support .
what do you mean ?
well , in this highly competitive world , when a man has no profession there isn' t much choice , so i began looking for people who had more money than they needed , including some they' d barely miss .
you mean , you' re a thief ?
well , that' s not exactly the term i' d have chosen , but it sort of captures the spirit of the thing .
i don' t believe it .
i can' t really blame you now .
but i do believe it .
that' s what i don' t believe .
so it' s good bye , alexander dyle , welcome home , peter joshua .
sorry .
the name' s adam canfield .
adam canfield ?
mm hmm .
wonderful .
you' ve had three names in the past two days .
i don' t even know who i' m talking to anymore .
well , the man' s the same , even if the name isn' t .
no , he isn' t .
adam canfield is a crook , and i want to know why .
well , it' s simple .
i like what i do .
i enjoy my work .
there aren' t many men who love their work as much as i do .
you look around sometime .
is there a mrs. canfield ?
yes , but we' re divorced .
" but we' re divorced .
that' s right .
now go and eat your dinner .
oh , i could eat a horse .
i think that' s what you ordered .
don' t you dare be civil with me , after leading me on like this .
how did i lead you on ?
oh , all that marvelous rejection .
you knew i couldn' t resist it .
now it turns out all you' re interested in is the money .
that' s right .
ohh !
well , what would you like me to say ?
that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me ... than a quarter of a million dollars ?
i don' t suppose so .
it' s a toss up , i can tell you that .
mmm ...
what ?
hasn' t it occurred to you that i' m having a tough time keeping my hands off you ?
oh , you should see your face .
what' s the matter with it ?
it' s lovely .
ohh .
now what' s the trouble ?
i' m not hungry anymore .
isn' t it glorious ?
adam !
it' s all right .
come and look .
for her romeo came
and
it was closing night
the ending of
you don' t look so bad in this light .
why do you think i brought you here ?
maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work ... the competition was turning out .
pretty good , huh ?
i taught them everything they do .
oh , did they do that kind of thing way back in your day ?
sure .
how do you think i got here ?
i hear it still
i always will
not allowed to kiss back , huh ?
oh , no .
doctor said it was bad for my thermostat .
mm hmm .
charade
well , when you come on you come on , don' t you ?
well , come on .
yeah .
huh ?
in the lobby ?
are you out of your mind ?
it' s 3 : 30 in the morning .
you mean it ?
ah choo !
all right .
all right , i' il be right down .
wait a minute .
h ...
h hey , turn on the lights !
hey , how do you stop this thing ?
ah choo !
ah choo !
ah choo !
aaaaaah !
three of them , all in their pyjamas ?
c' est ridicule .
what is it , some new american fad ?
and now your friend who lives here , uh , the one from texas , he has disappeared into thin air .
where is he ?
i wish i knew .
madame ?
tell me , mr. dyle .
where were you at 3 : 30 a . m . ?
in my room , asleep .
and you , mrs. lampert ?
i was too .
in mr. dyle' s room ?
no , in my room .
obviously you' re telling the truth , for why would you invent such a ridiculous story ?
and if i were you , i wouldn' t stay in my pyjamas .
good night .
well , that wraps it up .
tex has the money .
i' il let you know when i' ve found him .
you' re gonna go looking for him now ?
if the police find him first , they' re not going to turn over that quarter of a million to us .
oh , adam ...
go to bed and bolt your door .
yeah ?
now you listen to me , dyle .
i know who' s got that money , man , and i want my share .
seems to be growin ' every day .
well , i ain' t disappearin ' till i get it .
where are you , tex ?
come on , man .
look , my mama didn' t raise no stupid children .
i' il tell you what .
you wanna find me , you just look over your shoulder ,
' cause from now on i' m gonna be right behind you .
open up .
i think i was wrong about tex having the money .
why ?
i just heard from him .
he' s still hungry .
that means killing gideon didn' t get it for him .
so he' s narrowed it down to us .
you' ve got it .
but i' ve looked everywhere .
you know i have .
where' s the airlines bag ?
in the wardrobe .
get it .
lord , you' re obstinate .
charles must have had it with him on the train when tex killed him .
thanks .
everybody and his aunt lillian' s been through that bag , including me .
okay , we' il do it again .
i' ve been into it at least once a day .
somebody would have seen it .
it' s there , reggie .
we' re looking at it right now .
something on that bed is worth a quarter of a million dollars .
but what ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
four passports .
no .
steamship ticket .
anything in there ?
nothing .
wallet .
comb ?
no .
a fountain pen .
what about that key ?
to the apartment .
matches mine exactly .
well ...
i bet you don' t really need those .
you need them .
this still doesn' t make sense , but it isn' t worth a quarter of a million dollars either .
wait a minute .
what ?
the tooth powder .
what about it ?
could you recognize heroin just by the taste of it ?
heroin .
peppermint flavored heroin .
mmm .
well , i guess that' s it .
dead end .
well , go to bed .
you' ve gotta go to work in the morning .
there' s nothing more we can do tonight .
i love you , adam .
yes , you told me .
no .
the last time i said , " i love you , alex .
oh .
oh .
hold it .
they' re recognizing great britain .
ooh , la vache .
mr. chairman , fellow delegates ... and my distinguished colleague from italy .
her majesty' s delegation has listened with great patience to the southern european ...
oh , are you on ?
no , it' s all right .
what' s wrong , adam ?
nothing .
i think i' ve found something .
i was snooping around tex' s room and came across this in the wastebasket .
i stuck it together again .
that' s the receipt grandpierre gave me for charles ' things .
i don' t see how that' s going to ...
no , you' re not looking .
when we went through the airlines bag , something was missing ... an agenda .
that' s an appointment book , isn' t it ?
it wasn' t there .
that' s right .
i remember grandpierre looking through it , but there was nothing in it the police thought was very important .
can you remember anything in it ?
well , it did say something about charles ' last appointment .
with who ?
where ?
i think it only said where .
come on , reggie , think .
this may be what we' re looking for .
adam , that money doesn' t belong to us .
if we keep it , we' il be breaking the law .
nonsense .
we didn' t steal it .
there' s no law against stealing stolen money .
of course there is !
there is ?
when did they pass such a silly law ?
now think , reggie .
what was in that appointment book ?
a place or street corner or something .
watch it .
i' m on .
... of , of the western hemisphere conference ... ... of the western hemisphere conference ... held on march 22 ...
no , wait !
it was last thursday , 5 : 00 .
jardin des champs elysees .
that' s it , adam !
the garden !
well , it' s thursday today , and it' s almost 5 : 00 , so come on .
it' s all right , gentlemen .
carry on .
now what ?
5 : 00 , thursday , the gardens .
must be something around here .
charles ' appointment was last week .
yes , i know , but this is all we' ve got left .
you' re not kidding .
ten minutes ago i had a job .
now you' ve got another job , so stop grumbling and start looking .
i' il take that side .
you poke around over here .
it' s hopeless .
i don' t even know what we' re looking for .
i don' t think tex does either .
tex ?
is he here ?
look .
i' m going to see what he' s up to .
you stay here .
be careful , adam .
he' s already killed three men .
wait !
wait !
taxi !
back up .
all right , where' s the letter ?
the letter , huh ?
it ain' t worth nothin ' .
you know what i mean .
the envelope with the stamps on it .
i want it .
you greenhorn .
why , you thick skulled , harebrained , half witted greenhorn .
and they was both too smart for us .
what are you talking about ?
first her husband , now her ?
she batted all of them big eyes at you ... and you fell for it like an egg from a tall chicken .
you want the envelope ?
there .
you take it .
it' s all yours .
you killed all three of ' em for nothin ' !
you greenhorn !
you blockheaded jackass !
you are a nincompoop !
sylvie !
what are you doing here ?
i' m waiting for jean louis .
oh .
what' s he up to ?

i was expecting you .
i knew you would come .
look at them , madame .
have you ever , in your entire life , seen anything so beautiful ?
i' m sorry .
i don' t know anything about stamps .
i know them as one knows his own face , though i had never seen them .
this one , a swedish four shilling ... called da gula fyraskillingen , printed in 1854 .
what is it worth ?
oh , the money is unimportant .
i' m afraid it' s very important .
well , in your money , perhaps $85, 000 .
may i sit down ?
yes .
and the blue one ?
oh , it' s called the hawaiian blue .
in 1894 the owner was murdered by a rival collector ... who was obsessed to own it .
and what is its value today ?
sixty five thousand .
and the last one .
ah , the best for last .
le chef d' oeuvre de la collection .
the masterpiece .
the most valuable stamp in the world .
it' s called the gazette maldave .
it was printed by hand on colored paper ... and marked with the initials of the printer .
today it has a value of $100000 .
i' m not a thief , madame .
i knew there was some mistake .
you gave the boy a great many stamps in return .
are they for sale now ?
let me see .
three hundred and fifty european ; two hundred asian ; a hundred and seventy five american ; a hundred african ; and 12 princess grace commemorative .
which comes to ten francs .
and don' t forget these .
thank you .
i' m sorry .
oh , no .
for a few minutes they were mine .
that is enough .
adam ?
adam ?
hello ?
mr. bartholomew ?
yes .
tex is dead .
smothered .
and adam did it .
he killed them all .
are you sure ?
yes , i' m sure .
tex wrote the word " dyle " before he died .
he' s the murderer , i tell you .
wait a minute , mrs. lampert .
you' d better give that to me again .
it was the stamps on the letter charles had with him on the train .
they were in plain view all the time , but no one looked at the envelope .
mrs. lampert , listen to me .
you' re not safe as long as you have these stamps .
let' s see .
do you know the center garden at the palais royale ?
the colonnade ?
yes , by the colonnade .
as fast as you can get there .
hurry , mrs. lampert .
i' m leaving right away .
reggie !
the stamps !
where are they ?
reggie !
wait !
so you can kill me too ?
tex is dead .
he wrote " dyle " on the carpet .
i' m not dyle .
you know that .
but tex didn' t know it .
you' re a murderer .
reggie , i want those stamps !
palais royale , vite .
mais je suis occupe .
mais c' est tres urgent .
occupe .
whoa !
billet !
ohh !
american embassy .
american embassy ?
uh , mr. bartholomew' s office , please .
would you speak a little louder , please .
i can' t speak any louder .
mr. hamilton bartholomew .
i' m sorry .
mr. bartholomew has left for the day .
but someone' s trying to kill me .
what ?
kill me !
you' ve got to get word to him right away .
he' s in the center garden of the palais royale near the colonnade .
tell him i' m trapped in a phone booth right below him in the metro station .
the name' s lampert .
hello ?
hello .
mr. bartholomew ?
yes .
there was a call for you just now , mr. bartholomew .
it sounded quite urgent .
a mrs. lampert .
lampert ?
i don' t know any mrs. lampert .
she says she' s trapped in a metro station and someone' s trying to kill her .
trying to kill her ?
who does she think i am , the c. i. a. ?
all right , i guess you' d better call the french police .
mr. bartholomew !
mr. bartholomew !
help me !
reggie !
stop !
that man is carson dyle .
we all know carson dyle is dead , mrs. lampert .
i tell you , he' s carson dyle .
now , you' re not gonna believe him .
bring those stamps over here .
he' s trying to trick you again .
tex recognized him .
that' s why he wrote dyle .
if you take him those stamps , he' il kill you too .
mrs. lampert !
if i' m who he says i am , what' s preventing me from killing you right now ?
because he' d have to come out to get the stamps , and he knows he' d never make it .
mrs. lampert , he wants the money for himself .
that' s all he' s ever wanted .
he' s with the c. i. a. i saw him at the embassy .
i tell you , he' s carson dyle .
that' s right , mrs. lampert .
that' s right .
i' m a dead man .
look at me .
oh , i don' t know who anybody is .
reggie , i beg you .
just trust me once more .
why should i ?
i can' t think of a reason in the world why you should .
stop , mrs. lampert , or i' il kill you !
it won' t get you the stamps , dyle .
you' il still have to come out , and i' m not likely to miss at this range .
maybe not , but it takes a lot of bullets to kill me .
they left me there with five in my legs and my stomach .
they knew i was alive , but they left me there .
i spent ten months in a german prison camp with nothing to stop the pain .
they left me there .
they deserved to die .
but i had nothing to do with it .
you' ve got the money now .
it belongs to me .
mrs. lampert , they knew i was still alive , but they left me there .
that' s why i had to kill them , all four of them .
please believe me .
i' il kill you too .
it won' t make any difference .
it' s no use .
you' re running out of time .
i' ve come too far to turn back .
i swear , i' il kill you !
make up your mind , mrs. lampert .
now .
adam !
all right .
i know you' re in there , mrs. lampert .
come on out .
do you hear me ?
come on out !
i don' t want to kill you , but i will .
come on out .
the game is over , mrs. lampert .
aaaaah !
you didn' t have to chase me so hard .
that one' s done .
do this one .
oh .
i' m sorry i thought you were the murderer , but how was i to know he was as big a liar as you are ?
is that all the gratitude i get for saving your hide ?
rub your own blinking foot .
was it my hide , or those stamps ?
what a terrible thing to say .
how could you think that ?
then prove it to me .
tell me to go to the embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps .
i said , tell me to go to the embassy first ...
i heard you , i heard you .
then say it .
now , reggie , listen to me .
there' s something i' d like to explain .
never mind .
i' il go by myself .
what makes you think they' re even interested ?
it' s only a quarter million .
it' il cost more than that for them to fix their bookkeeping .
now , as a taxpayer ...
who' s a taxpayer ?
crooks don' t pay taxes .
excuse me , soldier ...
marine , ma' am .
forgive me .
who would i see regarding the return of stolen government money ?
you might try the treasury department .
room 217 , second floor , mr. cruikshank .
217 .
thank you , marine .
uh , do you mind if i don' t go in with you ?
the sight of all that money being given away might make me break out .
mr. cruikshank , please .
my name is lampert .
yes .
mr. cruikshank ?
a miss lamp ...
mrs.
mrs. lampert to see you .
yes , sir .
go right in .
thank you .
of all the mean , rotten , contemptible , crooked ...
crooked ?
i should think you' d be glad to find out i' m not crooked .
you can' t even be honest about being dishonest .
why didn' t you say something ?
we' re not allowed to tell .
come on , give me the stamps .
mm mmm .
wait .
how did dyle get an office in this building ?
when did you meet him ?
what time of day , i mean .
about 1 : 00 .
the lunch hour .
probably worked it out in advance .
found an office usually left open and moved in for the time you were here .
then how do i know this is your office ?
mrs. foster , take a memo to bartholomew in security recommending ...
bartholomew !
recommending that embassy offices be kept locked during the lunch hour .
mmm .
starting with his own .
give me the stamps .
come on .
what' s your first name today ?
brian .
brian cruikshank .
serves me right if i get stuck with that one .
who asked you to get stuck with any of them ?
is there a mrs. cruikshank ?
yes .
but we' re divorced .
no .
oh .
my mother .
she lives in detroit .
you' d like her .
she' d like you too .
come on , give me those stamps .
not until you prove to me that you' re really brian cruikshank .
next week i' il put it on a marriage license .
how about that ?
quit stalling .
i want some identification now .
i wouldn' t lie on a license .
you can' t prove it .
you' re still trying to ...
marriage license " ?
did you say " marriage license " ?
don' t change the subject .
just give me the stamps .
oh , i love you , adam , alex , peter , brian , whatever your name is .
oh , i love you .
i hope we have a lot of boys .
we can name them all after you .
well , before we start that , may i have the stamps ?
