who are we going with ?
with god .
in these rivers on the plains ... ... one should always have sacred company .
without the right company , the boatman doesn' t travel in peace .
especially ... ... since you came into the land of ms. barbara .
in other words , in the lion' s den .
really , boss ?
that and more , young man .
do you know that woman' s story ?
it is told by the voice of the plains .
and that voice does not lie .
from beyond the cunaviche .
from beyond the sinaruco .
from beyond the meta .
farther away than far itself ... ... is where that woman came from .
her origin is lost in the mystery of virgin lands .
she grew up in a boat that sailed ... ... the rivers of the jungle around the orinoco river .
there were six men on board .
they were tough and brutal .
their lustful eyes feasted ... ... upon the nascent beauty ... ... of the woman she was starting to become .
one afternoon ... ... when the boat was about to sail off ... ... a young man approached the captain .
he was nice looking ... ... well mannered , but poorly dressed .
his name was asdrubal .
he wanted to go to rio negro .
since he had no money ... ... he agreed to work in exchange for his fare .
and love , to which her soul was maybe predisposed ... ... was soon contemplating her ... ... with a tender smile .
but wicked passions were stalking her .
one night , while the boss was on land ... ... the sailors wagered in a card game ... ... the girl' s innocence .
now her soul can only harbor a grudge ... ... and nothing can placate her loathing toward men .
sometime after that ... ... she showed up here on that boat , trading food ... ... for animal skins among the ranches along the banks .
so her fortune began .
the rest she obtained through witchcraft and evil doings .
and now she owns most of the arauca .
presiding over lands and lives ... ... herds and savannas ... ... the plains fear her and obey her .
her beauty fascinates men .
her gold buys laws that protect her ... ... and hired hands that kill for her .
ms. barbara .
the fearsome ms. barbara .
her .
her alone , and always ... ... implacable .
the man eater .
now she' s not quite eating men .
now .
you' re seeing things , lorencito .
where do you see ms. barbara ?
is she separate from the plains ?
the terrible female .
the man eater .
you' re drunk on that stuff .
leave it be , lorenzo barquero .
all you can think about is ms. barbara .
your favorite topic : the terrible female .
she took over your will and ... ... sucked out your brain and your marrow .
she took your farm and your land ... ... and when you had nothing left at all ... ... she slammed the door of your house on your face .
enough .
don' t be angry with me , lorencito .
i' m your pal .
i was just saying that now ms. barbara ... ... is herding others ' cattle , not eating men .
all the cattle she can get today in altamira .
not hers .
whatever moves on these plains is hers .
she is violence , the terrible female who owns this land .
bravo .
are you thinking about your cousin ... ... doctor santos luzardo who owns that cattle ... ... that she' s rounding up before he arrives ?
what did you say ?
santos luzardo is coming ?
that' s right .
to watch over his herd in altamira .
he hired a boat in san fernando .
he' il be here soon .
a luzardo in the arauca region again .
he' il still find a barquero here .
you' re what' s left ?
not much man left then .
yes , me .
the last barquero against the last luzardo .
you' re pouring whisky on the floor .
you don' t have the nerve to continue ... ... the war between barqueros and luzardos .
everyone' s dead .
let' s change the subject .
i have a business proposition for you .
business ?
that' s right .
ms. barbara left you in ruin .
but also a capital which can ... ... pay you good dividends later on .
the daughter you sired with her , marisela .
that' s a pretty name for her .
she' s a luscious woman now .
what do you mean ?
i want to have marisela in this house .
i came here to hunt tigers .
but i' m tired of living alone all the time .
now brag that the man eater can' t beat you .
me strong man .
look , my hand doesn' t tremble .
don' t change the subject , lorencito .
i said i want to have marisela here .
here in my home .
you mean you want to marry her ?
i didn' t say that .
i brought 48 bottles of whisky from san fernando .
good whisky that costs a bundle ... ... to drink with my friend lorenzo barquero .
lorencito still had some dignity left .
and he was angry at his friend mr. guillermo .
but he heard that there are 48 bottles here .
what' s the meaning of this ?
didn' t we agree i' d never see you again ?
but i need to talk to you ... ... about our daughter , not about me .
our ?
is there something that belongs to us both ?
you took all i had , but i' m not here for that .
i ask for protection for marisela .
a bad man' s lust .
what bad man would that be ?
mr. guillermo .
ah .
your friend with whom you get drunk every day .
he wants your daughter as payment ?
you can prevent that for her sake .
you scum .
well , i will do something .
i' il send her some advice , listen well .
tell her to dominate that man' s will .
like you bewitched me ?
yes .
to bewitch him , to ruin him like you did to me .
really ?
poor creature of god .
but listen ...
out of my sight .
my chile .
my chile .
what doing here , what if animals bite you ?
i can cure myself with herbs .
look what i brought for you .
sweet as honey .
goodness .
anything else , juan primito ?
nothing more .
nothing more .
then you say you care about me .
little one , didn' t i carry you since you was baby ?
don' t i bring you sweet honey ... ... from the bees and tasty fruit ?
i' m kidding , my chile .
also brought something for ... ... today' s lunch , it' s in the kitchen .
two broiled partridges .
partridges or herons ?
holy mother .
those herons are birds from hell ... ... i' ve seen them flying over there .
why ?
well .
you know they' re the bad instincts of people ?
yes .
when one' s bad instincts start acting up .
the whole sky fills with herons , those ugly birds .
it' s the mistress , let me hide quick .
first time she passes by here .
what is she looking for ?
let me hide better , just in case .
what' d she say ?
what' d she say ?
nothing , she just stared at me .
and tossed that at me .
like a bone to a dog .
don' t get it , dad .
she stared at her .
what if she jinxed her ?
ldiot .
let' s go home .
come .
this land wanted some good news .
and i' m here to tell it .
i crossed the altamira , i saw it again .
old man melesio .
the santos boy recognized you ...
as if twenty years hadn' t passed .
here we are , antonio .
my outings pal when we were little .
we looked for beehives and nests .
i' m back for whatever expeditions are needed now .
well said , son .
sandovales stand with luzardos to fight .
gather round , luzardo team ... ... so the doctor can see you ... ... and knows who he can count on .
this is maria nieves , don' t mind his name .
you' il see he' s a real man alright .
you can count on us , doctor .
i' m telling you .
this one .
hold on , antonio .
let me introduce myself ... ... just in case , you never know .
juan palacio is my name .
call me bird like everyone else .
behind this hand is an open man .
from the wide plains , who ... ... gives himself openly on first sight .
you said it , and your word has weight .
the overseer , balbino paiba .
no sir .
carmelito lopez .
from the plains as well .
i don' t swear allegiance right away .
nice to meet you .
listen to your first impression .
is paiba around ?
no sir .
he was aware you were coming .
probably thinks his job' s at risk ... ... since his accounting is iffy .
so he took off before being asked .
we' il talk about that later .
what do you think of him ?
well .
i doubt he' s what we need ... ... here to face up to ms. barbara .
well i do , carmelito .
he looks like a luzardo , real men all of them .
altamira isn' t what it used to be .
a master' s hand' s been needed here for 20 years .
because of her .
the administrators have all been crooks .
not to mention the one that' s the worst .
balbino paibas is great ... ... at taking what ain' t his .
after only three months here ... ... he' s taken lots of cattle to corrals at miedo .
there' s still wild cattle in altamira .
and five of us here .
ready to do what' s needed .
they say five fingers make a hand .
an invalid can do lots with a straight hand .
thanks , bird .
you' ve met your people , doc .
come to my place before you go to yours .
so you can meet my family .
will you ?
sure , let' s go .
why did you hide from me ?
where , ma' am ?
you think i can' t see ?
you were with marisela .
you think i don' t that ... ... you give her food every day ?
if it weren' t for that .
what would she do ?
would' ve starved long ago .
is it wrong to give her some leftovers from here ?
behind my back , yes .
i won' t do it again ma' am .
whatever you gave to marisela ... ... wrapped in a handkerchief ... ... she didn' t take it .
no ?
i brought it back .
give it to the dogs .
ma' am .
have you ever seen dogs eat silver ?
it' s actually gold .
you don' t say , ma' am .
let me feel it at least before you take it .
get out .
all right ma' am .
hi , juan primito .
hi , mr. balbino .
careful , folks are nervous today .
surely not due to me .
today was okay .
wasn' t it ?
what was that ?
today was an okay day .
eighty head from altamira ... ... that we' il brand as miedo cattle .
i' il brand them .
because you , mr. balbino ... ... will be busy in altamira .
giving your report to doctor luzardo .
you know the captain' s cigarettes ?
smoke your brand .
i ran out , neighbor .
then keep them all .
juan primito was right .
folks are nervous around here .
he didn' t explain why , but as to fighting ... ... if that' s why doctor luzardo came ... ... we' il beat him in no time flat .
i think dr. luzardo came to review ... ... how well you' re managing altamira .
one may not see what one will trip on .
what' s the matter , neighbor ?
you know i was in altamira ... ... to render my services to you .
thanks to my recommendation ... ... luzardo trusted you as overseer .
he never even saw you .
true enough .
but haven' t my services ... ... compensated your favor to me ?
i really can' t complain .
so why the attitude ?
mr. balbino .
they' re expecting you at altamira .
let them wait .
my place is right here .
this is all i care about .
it' s high time we formalize situations ... ... that are not well defined .
ours , for instance .
ours ?
yes .
people are wondering if we do or don' t .
so we' d best show them ... ... before god and men alike ... ... that we do .
you forget , balbino paibas ... ... that i use men at my convenience .
i spit them out when i' m done .
do it once again .
i trust you .
excuse me .
come in , melquiades .
did the horses arrive well ?
yes , ma' am .
and i brought their full value .
in gold ounces as requested .
we heard you came to palo de agua .
in the boat with doctor luzardo .
is that so , melquiades ?
make sure it' s all there .
it must be , you' re never wrong .
you don' t have that bad habit .
i assume it' s to pick up on the gossip around .
and since i like to know , too .
do you want to ask me something ?
in a minute .
after mr. balbino has left .
good afternoon .
lots of talk aboard the boat ?
some , not all of it important .
lots of fancy words , though .
that doc sure does talk pretty .
and what is he like ?
he' s a good looking man .
i have a picture of him , in fact .
from the san fernando news .
says he' s back on the plains .
here it is , in the paper .
i brung it for you to see him .
he looks the same in person .
just in case you run into him .
you know how life is .
he really is good looking .
do you have any other questions ?
no , you can go .
good night .
he' s talking in the picture .
like i said , he does talk pretty .
carmelito , why are you leaving ?
i' m a good judge of character .
dr. luzardo , with due respect ... ... doesn' t look like what we need ... ... to set things straight here .
give the man some time .
if it turns out i' m wrong , then ... ... i' il leave altamira with you .
do it for a friend who ... ... has never betrayed your trust .
mr. balbino .
no one raises his voice at me .
mr. balbino , i' il do what needs doing .
say the word and i' m ready .
what is it ?
this horse is mine .
i gave no order to saddle it .
we think it belongs to dr. luzardo .
he owns everything in altamira .
venancio is taming it for him .
on your orders ?
yes .
are you overseer of altamira ?
not quite .
as long as i am ...
i represent the master' s authority .
but you' re not any longer .
but ...
at least ...
i haven' t given you numbers .
don' t bother .
i can imagine what you' il say .
i always assume the ... ... consequences of my mistakes ... ... so keep what you took and get out .
but ...
there are no buts .
i think we' re done talking .
doctor luzardo , you' ve offended me .
and you' ve robbed me .
well , fellas .
that one' s saddled and ready to go .
everything' s ready .
when you were still a kid ... ... no one had to tame your horses for you .
right , antonio .
wait venancio , i' il do it .
this one ain' t quite tame yet .
don' t worry .
let go .
move aside , maria nieves .
watch how it' s done , carmelito .
watch the eyes , venancio .
come on , hurry , doctor .
careful .
come on now .
what do you say about that ?
i was raised with the man .
santos luzardo .
i came to offer friendship .
your friendship .
not between barqueros and luzardos .
too much blood has run on both sides .
i don' t want it to continue .
well i do , i want it to .
what' s this ?
won' t you defend yourself ?
are your hands enough for you ?
well for me , too .
hold it .
a luzardo in a barquero' s house .
and both are still alive .
you were the family' s hope at one time .
lorenzo , the intelligent one with promise .
i admired you when we were kids .
santos luzardo .
the lorenzo barquero of today has ... ... nothing in common with the one you recall .
say you haven' t seen him again .
that he no longer exists .
this land won' t let it go .
it surrounds you and affects you .
it crushes your will .
the hope of the family .
my great intelligence .
not true .
truth is what you' re seeing .
what i' ve become .
see yourself in me , santos .
you' ve come , too .
you heard the call of the man eater , too .
lorencito .
lorencito .
i didn' t know lorenzo had company .
my name is guillermo .
i was about to tell you my name too .
but i can see you have no interest .
here , give me that .
wait , lorencito .
i need this whisky to help me hunt tigers .
while tigers appear .
give it to me .
ready for the business i proposed ?
give it to me .
you mean , done deal .
you' re a witness , doctor luzardo .
mr. guillermo paid me in advance ... ... for a deal struck with lorenzo barquero .
of legal age and domiciled here , as they say .
what' s this about ?
i don' t need to satisfy your curiosity .
then why compromise my witnessing it ?
oh , bad , bad .
the dr. doesn' t want mr. guillermo' s friendship .
all right .
bye lorencito , remember .
it' s a done deal .
what did you do ?
santos luzardo .
you admired him as a child .
he' s done the worse thing a man could do .
this is the price of my daughter .
are you marisela ?
pretty name , ugly face .
crooked mouth and cross eyed .
me , cross eyed ?
guess i heard wrong .
not cross eyed , mouth is fine , but ugly , yes .
unless i didn' t see straight .
let me see you again to be sure .
come .
you are beautiful , girl .
even more so now .
you should care for yourself better .
let me go .
don' t get angry .
don' t bet what ?
angry , as in don' t get mad .
get mean .
that' s it .
so why dintcha say so then ?
get angry .
you have a knack for learning .
teaching you is an investment .
who says you can be my teacher ?
santos luzardo , your dad' s cousin .
i knew it .
come .
where ?
to the water .
it cleans and beautifies .
i won' t bathe in front of you !
no , just wash your face .
is it sunday ?
come on , you mountain cub .
see the sky reflected in the water .
this will be a transcendental moment .
a solemn rite which i' il officiate as priest .
on your knees .
that' s it .
learn from the water .
it knows how to stay clean amid the swamp mud .
clear waters that touch the sky .
that' s a song .
do you know it ?
sing it to me another day or you' il cry .
me , cry ?
yes , you .
you' re so dumb .
quiet down , you' il be happy ... ... when you see yourself in a mirror .
golly .
now we can call you ... ... marisela , with the pretty name and face .
song of the harp of the plain .
where the skies look upon each other .
okay , go now .
all right , but i' il come back for you .
you' il live in altamira with me , see you later .
good day .
' day .
go on , say it .
santos luzardo , man .
fancy seeing you here .
don' t you recognize me ?
frankly .
freshman law at the university .
mujiquita , man .
oh , mujiquita .
remember those days , santos luzardo ?
roman law , canonical law , sociology .
you swore you weren' t made for law .
you never did your homework .
i didn' t eat well .
i had to accept not being a doctor .
well , you' re not missing too much .
in this country , doctors ... ... serve ministers and generals .
i serve a colonel .
i call him general to make him happy .
now you can say you' re a doctor .
oh , santos luzardo .
have a seat , man .
what are you here for ?
to ask the authorities ... ... to call ms. barbara and mr. guillermo ... ... my neighbors of altamira .
i need them to comply with ... ... certain legal prescriptions .
do you know who she is , ms. barbara ?
of course i do .
she seems to be above the law ... ... but i' il make her obey it .
the civil authority , colonel bernalete ... ... is out of town today .
of course i can issue subpoenas .
like other times .
are you scared this time ?
actually , no .
sure looked like it to me .
take over .
i' m risking my livelihood for you .
to appear in this office after so much time .
bernalete must be crazy .
i received a subpoena , too .
at the request of the interested party .
santos luzardo , of course .
santos luzardo wants to fight .
worried ?
pleased .
i needed a good fight .
and by the way .
you know that dr. luzardo took ... ... lorenzo barquero and marisela to live at altamira .
i heard .
let' s go .
honoring that subpoena ?
and why not ?
i' il face santos luzardo soon .
he' il see my capabilities .
i didn' t plan on going .
but i' il gladly join a good fight .
given what was splained
explained .
it' s all been proved .
everything has been cleared .
what' s going on ?
i didn' t say that word you just recorded ?
you said explained , proved and cleared .
it was a lot of ' eds .
too many of them .
what do you care ?
avoiding cacophony , general .
cacophony .
it' s impolite to correct me .
take it off , young mujica .
don' t end up losing something else .
no , no general .
as you wish .
that' s right , as i wish .
it is now clear .
the iron used on the steer .
hold on .
how did you spell iron ?
with an " e " , general .
i knew you' d put an " e " in there .
dot the " i " so it sounds like i say it .
done , general .
that " e " is actually an absurd letter .
because it has no sound .
it wasn' t used in old castilian .
people said ir' n and not iron .
gorge' s , not gorgeous .
wait , mujiquita .
don' t tell me i speak old castilian .
nor new castilian .
the general jokes .
i joke .
let' s get to the real business .
you don' t fool me , mujiquita .
you' re forgetting something .
and so you' re nervous .
true , general , i forgot .
this morning ... ... dr. santos luzardo came by .
to subpoena ms. barbara and mr. guillermo .
did you say ms. barbara ?
and you complied ?
yes general , it seemed
so , it seemed to you .
so you dare actually usurp my duties .
you were out of town .
still , you should' ve respected ... ... the instrument of my authority .
but subpoenas ... ... i' ve done before with your approval .
but this is about ms. barbara , dummy .
out of my way , mujiquita .
what a surprise .
hello .
what' s new with mr. guillermo ?
you made us come racing over here .
from such a distance .
you don' t say ?
it' s been a real calamity .
i' il explain it to you .
the subpoena requestor should be here soon .
and he' il end up learning a lesson .
eight days arrest with his accomplice .
so they learn to respect those i esteem .
please have a seat .
good afternoon .
how can i help you ?
i' ve asked these people to appear .
you' ve asked or begged them ?
i' ve asked .
as is my right by law .
then be brief .
no need to ask for that .
first the gentleman .
if the lady doesn' t mind .
don' t worry dr. luzardo .
for the last shall be the first .
you say you own certain lands .
i say ?
my title deeds are duly registered .
purchased from mr. lorenzo barquero .
very well .
i' m not challenging such purchases .
but according to the deeds ... ... you do not possess the minimum required ... ... by law to round up cattle ... ... and brand it as your own .
can you prove what you say ?
certainly .
my intent is to make you ... ... obey the law , by paying ... ... to have your property fenced .
tell me , dr. luzardo .
what role do i play in this ?
you' re the authority hearing my case .
mr. mujica .
bring the law book .
don' t bother colonel .
dr. luzardo is right .
mr. guillermo must fence in his land .
oh , gosh .
if you say so .
why , colonel ?
because that' s ms. barbara' s law , too .
you heard , dr. luzardo .
maybe your legislators forgot something ... ... that could be applicable .
like the obligation to contribute to the cost ... ... of the fence between altamira and miedo .
i see you know how to meet a challenge .
or as we say here .
use one' s horse to reign in cattle .
mr. mujica .
yes , general .
take note of the agreement .
ms. barbara disagrees with ...
excuse me , colonel .
i' il do as dr. luzardo asks .
it' s his right .
and mr. guillermo .
will i' m sure obey the law too .
fencing in his small plot .
which are just small breeding savannas .
so rules the law of the plains .
right , doctor luzardo ?
yes ma' am .
comments , mr. guillermo ?
i think i' il hunt tigers elsewhere .
where you won' t need to obey the laws ?
oh , mr. guillermo .
good afternoon .
good bye colonel bernalete .
since when do you treat me that way ?
' bye , colonel .
mr. mujica .
you are hereby relieved of your position .
look , dad .
he brought me this ... ... so i can make pretty dresses , too .
look , this one' s pretty .
so is this one .
aren' t you listening ?
mosey on over here .
mosey ?
you don' t say mosey .
say come over here .
i know , i said it on propose .
on purpose .
it' s not time for lessons .
i' il always teach you to talk right .
what' s wrong with you ?
he been that way since you left .
lips sealed shut .
scold him .
he been or he' s been ?
i' il have to keep my shut my mouth too .
my corrections bother you ?
no .
causes me pain .
pain or shame ?
pain is suffering , and i don' t want that .
i forgot to thank you for this gift .
why do you laugh ?
your feeling ashamed .
you said that to goad me .
cheer up , man .
you going to sit forever ?
take notice .
he has to go from hating to being grateful .
call it liking and it won' t be as bad .
juan primito .
juan primito .
yes , ma' am .
throw that away .
holy mother , a broken mirror .
that means bad luck .
idiot .
is that dr. luzardo' s picture ?
good looking man .
i done seen him yesterday like in the paper .
what will you do with that ?
what' s it to you ?
go on .
i see you with my two eyes .
may yours be blind without them .
your judgment and pride .
between the saints ' backs .
so their grace can' t reach you .
i shine light on you .
with the light of the father .
with the light of the son .
and of the holy spirit .
man .
me seeing you like this .
tame and humble .
like christ before pilate .
three lights of evil are lit .
one for lucifer , one for satan , and one for beelzebub .
to light man' s way through perdition .
what can you say about your ... ... accomplishments in these parts ?
i haven' t done much , actually .
one guy lost his money because ... ... he slept close to me , a sleepwalker .
gosh .
has he woken up yet ?
i think so .
i said i ain' t done much yet .
well get with it , pal .
here at miedo ... ... men are backed by crosses ... ... that they created .
right , melquiades ?
don' t get me involved .
they call him scary here .
he' s killed seven men .
let it be known .
it was their doing .
i just gave them the spear .
they did the rest themselves .
throwing themselves to the hilt .
herons at night , juan primito ?
those are the worst .
see how they cover the whole sky .
what are herons ?
rare birds that juan primito sees .
at night .
he' s not as dumb as he looks .
they' re the lady' s bad instincts .
you' il see .
what do the herons want , juan primito ?
honey and vinegar .
honey of love and vinegar of bad intent for the christian .
gosh .
who is that christian ?
i don' t know .
but herons fly towards altamira .
is it doctor luzardo ?
who knows .
holy mother .
i bet she' s putting honey and vinegar .... ... on those herons so they get fed up .
and leave the christian alone .
juan primito must' ve seen something .
drink .
drink , you damned herons .
drink honey and vinegar , so you leave the christian alone .
i am a lark nesting over a lake .
and although i live over calm water , i am always awake
to think that it is so distant .
water , you are so close .
you' re so close , and i' m so far .
very nice .
oh , you were there .
i was hearing you sing , you' re not that bad .
i' m not that good at anything , i know it .
hey there .
hi .
look at what i found .
again .
what i found looking around .
don' t you like it for the living room ?
it isn' t exactly pretty .
i' il say .
i knew you' d find something wrong with it .
wait , you didn' t let me finish .
it isn' t your fault that it' s not artistic .
but , i like the idea of putting it on the table .
so , you see , i' m not so dumb after all .
i never thought so , quite the contrary .
i' ve always said you' re an intelligent girl , haven' t l ?
yes , you' ve said that enough .
that' s all you say to me .
what more do you want ?
ha , what more could i want ?
ha again ?
yes , ha .
don' t get upset .
i' m keeping score , you say it less and less every day .
it' s the first you miss .
doptor luzardo .
there' s no fine beast for miss marisela to ride .
i broke in this mare , and brought her as a gift .
if you' il allow me .
certainly , carmelito .
thank you very much , carmelito .
so you broke her in for me .
would you like to try her out ?
see how she behaves with you ?
now ?
i don' t have any riding gear .
you don' t ?
are you sure ?
go take a look .
we' re not so bad at breaking them in , are we ?
i understand what you are trying to say .
but i think ... ... that a positive person ... ... should move in positive ways .
am i clear ?
perhaps too clear .
i have a perfectly clear idea on my mind .
and only this do i put into words .
you need ... ... doctor luzardo ... ... to fall under your control and obey your will .
it' s true , and it will happen , don' t you worry .
marisela at doctor luzardo' s house ... ... gets in the way of your plans .
under the laws of this country ... ... your hold complete parental authority over marisela .
lsn' t that so ?
it is .
what if you use that authority ... ... and claim the girl as your daughter ... ... and take her home with you ?
and then ?
then , i will immediately take marisela for myself .
in matrimony .
i have no objection .
of course .
you would then be my son in law .
in other ways , my heir .
i didn' t go that far .
you are a positive person , mr. guillermo .
say what you shall .
but i have my own ways .
as far as my plans are concerned , don' t you worry .
may i accompany you ?
no , thank you .
will you do things your way ?
yes .
good luck , ms. barbara .
don' t trust your supernatural ways too much .
be wary of the mirages of the savanna .
it was just over here .
the famous house of macaniyal after the last change .
the deeds used it as a reference for the border ... ... between altamira and el miedo .
the house has functioned thanks to ms. barbara .
altamira has been within it .
but this time , the change was backwards .
change .
they took it apart and didn' t rebuild it because of this .
could this be a trap they set ... ... for when you put the fence up ?
maybe .
look .
good morning , doctor luzardo .
good morning , ma' am .
are you getting ready to set up the fence ?
no ma' am , i' il let you know in due time .
well .
i' m taking this opportunity to ... .... offer to gather my livestock wandering in the savanna .
and i hope you allow me ...
it' s not my custom to do that ... ... outside of the legal cowboy season .
but , since it is you , doctor luzardo ...
to please you , tell me when and where you want to begin .
day after tomorrow , dark meadow .
will you go ?
yes , ma' am .
so will l .
see you then , doctor luzardo .
good bye , ma' am .
come on , marisela .
beware , ms. barbara .
of the mirages of the savanna .
wind storms .
the wind makes them at destroys them .
they' re gone .
yes , they' re distroyed .
destroyed .
teaching , so early ?
no , there is no lesson today .
tonight there is song , dance and poems .
fiesta in altamira .
dancing , fun , fiestas .
how nice .
i shall sing it today , folks , it is special .
the music is my partner' s , the lyrics are mine .
the bud of altamira , marisela , will be replying .
play the harp , buddy .
marisela , pretty girl .
the harp plays a tune , soft bouquet not to be pruned that perfumes the sweetness of womb
marisela , you pretty girl .
the harp plays a tune , bouquet not to be pruned .
the harp plays a tune , soft bouquet not to be pruned . that perfumes the sweetness of womb .
maraca man , sing of my land of my simple people in pain .
they work , love and wait singing in tune not ever in vane .
they love and wait .
your music is their fate .
nice song .
i wonder who wrote it .
marisela , you' re a song born from the harp of this land torn
the savanna hears you doze , the savanna dreams of your pose .
marisela , you' re a song born from the harp of this land torn
the savanna hears you doze , the savanna dreams of your pose .
maraca man , sing of my land here is your verse that i demand .
i learned it just after i slept , as i saw the savanna and i wept
as i saw my beloved plain .
tell us , what did he say ?
nothing , not a word .
we all saw the way he spoke as you danced .
he whispered in your ear .
nothing special .
come on .
really , really .
tell us , tell us .
here he comes , go away .
what are you doing ?
remembering the lesson i wanted to forget .
the grammatical sentence is composed .
why do you laugh ?
it' s nothing .
then , you must be mad .
they say that the moon on the plain takes your sanity .
who knows , i myself am sane .
are you sure ?
what a pretty night , isn' t it ?
beautiful .
and the song was very pretty , wasn' t it ?
sure was .
did he compose it ?
who else could have ?
i thought maybe ... ... somebody else had .
since they were about me .
really ?
about you ?
how unpleasant .
nice night , huh ?
you , still here ?
do you mind if i look after you ?
mr. balbino' s time has come .
you have no knowledge , my friend ... ... of those who were peons when they fell asleep ... ... and woke up as butlers .
or vice versa .
such pretty women' s clothes hadn' t been seen here for a while .
neither had we seen that the line between el miedo ... ... moved backwards like it is doing now .
doptor luzardo better take care .
this card has been dealt .
juan says he has been dazzled .
there is no power to fight that .
my messenger , where is he ?
he' s over by the bush .
i seen him over there .
thanks , pal , i found them .
you must behave yourself , lucero .
hurry boys , it' s almost sun up .
it' s an hour to mata oscura .
we have to arrive first .
we' re ready .
are you prepared ?
they may not be so wild .
but we may have to break some in .
i' m taking a good rope they won' t resist .
for the others , just in case .
here is " fire spitter " , who is used ... ... to putting the bullet where he sets his eye .
when his hand isn' t shaking .
shut your trap , pigeon toes .
maria nieves knows that nothing makes me tremble .
i give quinine a fever .
an whoever tries to take me on , learns a lesson .
let' s go , you swindler .
hurry , the doptor' s on his way .
we' re ready .
hello , good morning .
up so early ?
i didn' t sleep all night .
we have to talk today .
right now .
we' re talking .
i can' t go on , santos luzardo .
it' s useless to ask me to regenerate .
it' s ridiculous .
it' s stupid .
don' t get upset , man .
i' ve decided to go home .
to go back to what i was .
to what i am .
fine .
your determinations coincide ... ... with my own tonight .
marisela cannot stay here .
she must be taken to the capital ... ... to a boarding school where she will get .... ... the education she needs .
to a school ?
how will i pay the tuition ?
that' s on me .
i will take her to caracas if you authorize it .
but since i cannot leave altamira for now ... ... you must sacrifice yourself ... ... and stay here until i can .
fine .
what you do with yourself is your business .
resting , doctor luzardo ?
yes , ma' am .
refreshment ?
thank you .
are you happy ?
it was a great day for you .
i am satisfied , that is true .
did you forget the regional skills ?
good rider , sure roper .
that is not surprising in a man .
much less for you who can rope ... ... and defeat a bull better than anyone .
a skill not admired in a woman , right ?
would you like to discuss ... ... the livestock ?
our men are on the subject .
meanwhile , we can chat like friendly neighbors .
we have something to tell each other , doctor luzardo .
actually , i' ve been meaning to talk to you .
about someone in particular ?
well , yes .
about somebody .
i know what you want to say .
that i' ve taken marisela' s inheritance away .
that i' ve forsaken her by ruining lorenzo barquero .
that she goes hungry and wears rags .
i was hungry and wore rags once .
and i was younger than marisela is now .
brutal men found satiation in me .
is it so far fetched ... ... that i have meant to make other people pay ... ... for the ill done to me ?
have you ever thought , i dare inquire ... ... of the harm you have inflicted ... ... upon yourself with that vendetta ?
the violence endured ... ... never justifies the violence applied .
continue , doctor luzardo .
i like to listen to you .
i had been told you were a pleasure to hear .
i wish i could believe you .
do .
and believe this , doctor luzardo .
had i come across you before , the story ... ... of my life would be different .
i' m expected .
excuse me .
he cannot carry the rope anymore .
thanks for making me laugh , child .
you' il be around .
miss " is written with m .
have you thought of the harm inflicted upon yourself ?
you are so quiet .
and you didn' t even lose the day .
no .
we herded over 1 00 cattle here .
who knows what was left at mata oscura .
long conversation with the mistress ?
quite so .
but not only that .
there is silence from that side .
silence .
who knows what she' s thinking .
don' t worry , partner .
with men like doptor luzardo ... ... we don' t run such danger .
boys , have you heard how things are bartered ?
he who owned a car yesterday , today owns a coach and martyr .
he who owned a car yesterday , today owns a coach and martyr .
well , winter is upon us .
announced by the herons ... ... who arrived earlier on .
doctor luzardo cannot complain .
the herons have behaved this year .
we must have a good deal of feathers by now .
they are priced mighty high ... ... so they' il give good money .
you will take them to san fernando .
get ready to leave tomorrow .
take your brother along with you .
like the doptor says .
and buy the wire we need for the fence .
the fence .
yes , boy .
the starting point nowadays ... ... of progress and civilization for the plains .
as long as each property is not fenced on ... ... nobody will begin improving the breeding ... ... nor respecting the rights of others .
rights , laws .
here the law is armed aggression .
hands tainted with blood .
do you think ms. barbara will ... ... respect your fence if you' re not willing to kill ?
come on , man .
i understand your reaction ... ... after being disabled .
but not to that extreme .
santos luzardo .
do not lose sense of reality .
there are only two ways here .
to kill , or to give in .
if you don' t want your rights tramples on .
don' t be appalled at the murderer' s red glory .
juan pimito .
my little one .
you are so pretty .
let me see you all cleaned up and with your hair combed .
and , wearing shoes .
my , you' ve put on weight .
i can tell you' re eating proper meals now .
but you are all dirty and ... ... wearing the same clothes .
aren' t you ashamed ?
and go around clean , girl ?
what for ?
nobody has to like me .
you have become dirty minded , juan primito .
what did you bring me ?
wild bee honeycomb .
a little taste of honey ... ... for your delicious mouth .
my chile .
why hadn' t you come ?
don' t say that .
the animals have been excited .
i don' t have ... ... time to do anything .
really ?
just imagine , my dearest child .
blessed mary .
there is a picture between candles ... ... with the three lights for evil ways that lead ... ... down the road with no end .
a picture ?
of who ?
of doptor luzardo , and he' s upside down .
did he give it to her ?
i don' t know , but it' s surrounded by candles , it is .
there is evil there , my child .
there is evil there ?
the man is upside down .
to make him weak before the woman .
like christ before pilates .
why don' t you take it and put out the candles ?
me ?
those candles can be put out ... ... only by the person who lit them .
otherwise , fates would be distorted .
and whoever puts them out ... ... will remain in the dark forever .
you fool .
where are those candles ?
in her room .
is she there ?
who knows .
she said she was going to town .
she may be gone by now .
saddle catira up .
the white mare in the corral .
what will you do , chile ?
i' m going over there .
holy mother of god .
what if doptor luzardo sees us ?
he isn' t here .
come on , let' s go .
santos luzardo .
it had to be .
yes , partner .
that' s a lost man .
come in , doptor luzaldo
sit down , ms. barbara will be right with you .
thank you .
welcome , doctor luzardo .
good morning , ma' am .
i finally have the pleasure of seeing you in my home .
i' ve come , for i am beginning ... ... to build the fence that will divide our properties .
in view of the fact that ... ... once again ... ... there were overnight changes ...
yes , sir .
things went back to where they began .
the fence dividing our lands ... ... is where it once was .
you have decided to give up illegally ... ... that which you won over me judicially .
why not ?
it is never too late to repair the damage done ... ... to oneself by evil deeds .
you said it yourself , doctor luzardo .
i quote you in good faith .
madam .
i have no right to doubt your possible sincerity .
but the restitution you intend ... ... by changing the fence ... ... is obviously illegal .
we shall legalize it in an adequate document ... ... which i am prepared to let you write yourself .
i am giving back part of the savanna to you to win over ... ... your friendship , which is more valuable to me .
thank you , ma' am .
but , now that you' re in the mood for restitution and repair ... ... i advise you to do other things ... ... which are fair and more humane .
restore the property to your daughter marisela .
man .
now that you mention her ... ... i was forgetting to congratulate you , dr. luzardo .
the girl is absolutely dashing ... ... ever since she has been living with you .
ma' am .
you have been so bold as to destroy in a moment ... ... the trust that i may have been ... ... placing in your intentions .
marisela does not live with me ... ... in the dirty sense you imply .
she' s at my house under my protection .
she has no bread , while her mother has it all .
all except what i foolishly came to ask of you .
noble feelings .
pretend we never spoke , about this or anything else .
oh heavens , partner .
the mistress ' witchcraft isn' t working .
or could it be that you are countering it ?
which room is hers ?
the first on the left , but she probably locked it .
we' il see , wait here .
chiled of mine .
three divine people , bring her out safely .
what are you doing here ?
what do you want ?
that picture .
do you really want it so badly ?
yes , give it to me .
are you in love with him ?
yes .
that man belongs to me .
you' re lying , you witch .
let me go , witch .
let me go .
let her go .
santos .
don' t worry about witchcraft .
you can go on with it .
things go back to where they began .
to where they began .
do rivers return to their source ?
those are your words .
my words .
she' s talking to the partner , holy mother of god .
my words .
does the lost soul return to the crossroads where he strayed ?
if you want him to come to you ... ... you must surrender your evil deeds .
what is wrong with me , what am i doing ?
i stumble over my own feet , i simply cannot find myself .
what' s wrong ?
i wish i would die , i wish i would die .
why ?
i am the evil woman' s daughter .
why did you do that , father ?
daughter .
with so many women in the world ... ... why , oh why did you choose that mother ?
what were you searching for ?
alcohol , alcohol .
to start over again .
no .
to put an end to it once and for all .
doctor , doctor luzardo .
what is it ?
bad news , doctor .
a messenger from town brought them .
on behalf of a colonel with carmelito' s horse .
carmelito' s ?
they found him dead in a grove ... ... near totuma' s ranch .
no sign of the feathers .
he was murdered .
saddle the horse , i' m going to town .
to the palm grove ?
santos is leaving for town .
prepare your things .
we' il leave right after him .
i' m with you , boy .
i hear you were close to him .
two men have been murdered .
murdered ?
carmelito lpez and his brother manuel .
they were taking sacks of feathers to san fernando .
what' s up , santos ?
we thought it was a case of natural death ... ... because only one body was found ... ... and there were no signs of violence .
did you take the body away ?
yes , in my duties as judge .
with general bernalete .
he must be at his home .
let me go talk to him .
talk to him ?
in your duties as judge ?
heavens , santos .
don' t you know where we live ?
because i gave you that citation ... ... i lost my post as secretary .
i owe it to the general that i' m a judge now .
i' m going to see him .
how long will you be unhappy , mujiquita ?
until , you know , such is life .
the hands of justice .
i am here , making a living .
five children , you must realize .
here comes the general .
you' re right on time , doptor luzardo .
let' s see .
what can you tell us about a peon of yours ... ... found dead at totuma' s grove ?
what can i tell you ... ... or is it a formal statement ?
yes , sir .
a single answer for your two headed question .
doctor luzardo already told me that carmelito lpez ... ... the deceased , was with his brother manuel ... ... taking two sacks of heron feathers .
so , now the truth comes up .
doctor luzardo , you suspect ... ... that this manuel character ... ... killed this carmelito character to steal the feathers .
not at all .
i suspect they were both murdered .
i hope you investigate in that direction .
i state it before the judge , who is the competent authority .
take note , honorable judge , of the witness' s statement ... ... when questioned by competent authority .
may i remind you that i am here , doptor luzardo .
make no mistake .
you' re the one making the mistake , colonel bernalete .
does doctor luzardo have anything more to say ?
that' s all , for now .
i get the feeling that i' m going to ... ... imprison the doctor for several days ... ... to teach him to respect authority .
step in his shoes , general .
two sacks of feathers at today' s price .
a considerable amount of money .
but he has supplied us with the clue out of this maze .
that manuel character .
will you order the investigation ?
when will you ever stop ... ... being such a dunce , mujiquita ?
you' il be buried in a white urn , you' re so naive .
if we do a real investigation ... ... we are going to run into ... ... ms. barbara herself .
we' ve got to forget this thing .
bury the dead .
but , what' s the cause of death ?
you' re not aware that carmelito was murdered ?
murdered .
i heard he died a natural death .
isn' t a stab in the back or a bullet wound ... ... natural death in these parts ?
his brother manuel , who was transporting the feathers ... ... to san fernando with him , is a suspect .
could it truly have been his own brother ?
two sacks of feathers are worth a lot of money .
that is true .
poor doctor luzardo .
he had his hopes set on that feather harvest ... ... to build a fence around altamira .
he can wait until next year .
did manuel take the feathers ?
who knows .
no .
those feathers must be hidden somewhere .
i' il ask the partner tonight .
don' t you know i have a ghostly partner ... ... who reveals to me everything of my interest ?
and , by the way ... ... i' m going to ask him what you' ve been up to ... ... the past few days you were gone .
do you have a new sweetheart ?
i' m going to get jealous .
no , i just wasn' t welcome in these parts .
after i' ve been on my good behavior .
you were at totuma' s grove .
what are you saying ?
i' m going to find out where those feathers are .
at least one of those sacks of feathers is mine .
yes , madam .
follow him , i want to know what he does .
killing time ?
in light of lack of food .
that is , as long as there' s no work .
there is a job at mata oscura .
the road to altamira passes by there .
doctor luzardo takes it on his way back .
i must talk to him today .
wait for him there and bring him .
what if he doesn' t want to come ?
by his own feet .
do as i say .
that i shall .
stop kidding yourself , mr. balbino .
i am not a child .
you didn' t come to offer me cattle or horses .
you want to sell feathers .
feathers ?
are you insane , mr. guillermo ?
selling feathers is dangerous business right now .
that depends .
but ...
tell me something .
what ?
have you passed by totuma' s grove lately ?
not exactly by the grove , no .
i' ve passed nearby on my way to san fernando .
that' s funny .
what ?
i did .
the day after the body was found .
authorities in this country have no eyes , they cannot see .
i searched the grove and i found ...
what ?
doesn' t this belong to you ?
what ?
it has your initials on it .
yes , this is yours , mr. balbino .
leave your gun at your hip .
take your thing .
i wasn' t planning on keeping it .
what do you intend ?
i don' t intend anything .
you came to make me a proposal .
let' s cut the games , mr. guillermo .
right now .
let' s get to the point .
you were right , i didn' t come to offer cattle .
i came to offer feathers , two sacks ' worth .
first class .
i buried them at the foot of a tree .
if you pay up we can go get them right now .
they wouldn' t be the first ... ... crooked feathers you buy .
you are mistaken , mr. balbino .
i don' t do business that' s not in my plans .
i ...
i was bored .
i just wanted to have a little fun .
you left that thing ... ... on my desk a long time ago .
i haven' t been to totuma' s grove .
it was all just a game .
a very dangerous game .
don' t you realize , mr. guillermo ?
not as dangerous as offering feathers .
but , fear not .
mr. guillermo doesn' t speak .
not because your guns scares him ... ... but because mr. guillermo doesn' t care ... ... what is stolen from dr. luzardo .
you understand ?
the good name returns to the palm grove .
good times are over , catira .
you , back to your savanna ... ... and me , back to my ranch .
go on .
my buddy lorenzo barquero is back at your house .
let us celebrate the event ... ... with some delicious spirits .
right out of the bottle , there are no glasses .
oh no , boy .
downing it like that is like getting shot .
slowly is better .
father .
good name !
welcome to the arms of mr. guillermo .
oh , stop it .
let me go .
give me ...
let me go .
father .
father .
father .
you creeps , let me go .
father .
father .
daddy .
daddy .
father .
father .
father .
been waiting for you , doctor .
for me ?
i was sent to fetch you , and i must take you with me .
dead or alive ?
that is up to you .
it won' t be alive .
well , then ...
the savanna mystery is over .
what were you doing here ?
i came from altamira to tell you the news .
when i saw melquiades hiding in the bush ... ... and since i know what line of work he' s in ... ... i went around and hid to watch him .
so you see my suspicions were right .
is he dead ?
dead as a rock , doctor .
what will we do with him ?
don' t be appalled ... ... at the murderer' s red glory .
when did this happen ?
this afternoon .
we had just returned from altamira .
why did you come back ?
i think i know .
i would feel like dying , too .
what will become of me now ?
of you ?
are you alone ?
i need you , too .
you were right , lorenzo barquero .
your advice was accomplished .
the red glory of murderers is now mine , too .
i have killed a man .
my hands are tainted with blood .
what do you say ?
no , it cannot be .
yes .
me , too .
i just killed melquiades .
melquiades .
i had to do it .
we panicked ...
what happened ?
melquiades .
it was melquiades .
it' s him .
is he wounded ?
where is he wounded ?
on his temple .
it was a good shot ... ... but the shooter was not face to face with him .
he hunted him down ... ... or was beside him .
that' s right .
that' s good , too .
where is balbino paiba ?
at totuma .
at the foot of a tree ... ... you will find dr. luzardo' s stolen feathers .
balbino must be digging them up .
get over there quickly and bring him to me .
dead or alive .
what should we do with him ?
take him home .
we' re going after mr. balbino .
who' s going ?
who' s there ?
hands up !
don' t move , mr. balbino .
don' t move .
good evening , ms. barbara .
great things happened today .
things are starting to go the right way .
really ?
as i arrived i was told ... ... that melquiades was killed ... ... and i just heard the confession by the murderer .
doctor luzardo .
how about that ?
i think you are mistaken , mr. guillermo .
it wasn' t doctor luzardo .
oh , really .
i heard it from his own mouth .
but ... ... i must have told you before ... ... that my friend lorenzo barquero ... ... is no longer with us , either .
did he finally die ?
this afternoon .
at the palm grove .
shortly after he returned from altamira with marisela .
ah , they had returned to the grove .
am i not right in saying things are taking the right path ?
once the father is dead ... ... parental authority over marisela ... ... is completely in your hands .
she is underage .
besides , doctor luzardo committed homicide .
that is not true .
it wasn' t him but balbino paiba who killed melquiades .
but i heard doctor luzardo tell marisela .
marisela ?
yes .
he is at her house at this very moment .
mr. guillermo ... ... you did not hear him make such a confession .
my , my .
i didn' t dream it .
you didn' t hear anything , is that clear ?
melquiades never liked balbino paiba .
my work .
both murderers .
my work , delivered .
i don' t quite understand what you are saying .
but ... ... what if balbino can prove it wasn' t him ?
he can' t .
because he' s also dead .
my peons spotted him ... ... digging up dr. luzardo' s stolen feathers .
he tried to shoot and was killed .
other things happened that night .
but ...
are you going to save luzardo ... ... when you could get rid of him ... ... by simply leaving him to his own means ?
yes .
i have inflicted enough harm upon myself with violence .
i want to take another road .
deliver my deeds .
return things to where they began .
start over again .
i think i get the picture .
but ...
it' s late , ms. barbara .
it' s much too late to start over .
you are wrong , mr. guillermo .
i still have my life ahead of me .
a lot ...
and it' s all mine .
all yours .
yes , ma' am .
unless such a young and beautiful woman ... ... were to cross your path right now .
but ...
that is nonsense .
ms. barbara is no longer ms. barbara .
i only came to notify you ... ... that lorenzo barquero is dead ... ... and that doctor luzardo is with marisela ... ... at the house in the palm grove .
having said that ... ... mr. guillermo puts his rifle on his shoulder ... ... and bids farewell to this world .
good bye , ms. barbara .
unless such a young and beautiful woman ... ... were to cross your path right now .
juan primito .
yes , ma' am ?
my horse .
yes , ma' am .
where are you going ?
only god knows .
mr. guillermo is right .
they will turn us all in roped together .
that' s what i think , too .
well , if that' s the case ... ... iet' s saddle up before he returns .
because if the late balbino ... ... is blamed for melquiades ' death ... ... they will blame us for his .
the way things are right now ... ... there is no doubt about that .
well , let' s saddle up .
let' s go , boys .
madam .
they' re all gone .
all of them .
what about you ?
what are you waiting for ?
i' il be damned .
what do they want now ?
the news runs from mouth to mouth .
the devourer of men is gone .
the ranch of fear no longer exists ... ... and all is back to normal at altamira .
the wide , open land .
all horizon , much like hope .
all roads , much like will .
