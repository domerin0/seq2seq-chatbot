you see , they are stubborn .
that' s the good thing about the germans .
man , you got to admit when they get an idea in their heads
right .
let' s see if our customer has arrived .
are you ready ?
uh huh .
and now our famous shepherd from the urals , who major konig thinks is an idiot , gets up to make sure he has hit his target .
major konig sees him .
aims for his helmet .
fires .
reveals his position and is shot in turn .
except ...
major konig doesn' t fire ...
because major konig isn' t there .
koulikov !
don' t you think that was strange , that last one ?
they sent him out to get shot like the others .
it' s not natural .
not without artillery , without trying to cover him .
oh , no , i' m the one who was stupid .
they don' t give a shit about telephone guys .
i mean , it' s like us with the ukrainians .
they' d never bother a major over a few dead grunts .
tomorrow , we' il kill us some generals .
whose turn is it ?
mine , i think .
oh , you' re such a cheater !
you can' t fool papa koulikov .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , it' s my turn to go first .
and it' s your turn to get a hole in your britches .
to victory .
this sniper business has been dragging on too long .
what' s that little fellow of yours up to ?
he' s probing , comrade kruschev .
he' s testing the germans for weaknesses .
he' s meticulous in his preparation .
vodka ... is a luxury we have .
caviar is a luxury we have .
time is not .
he' s aware of that comrade kruschev .
we both are .
i assure you he will succeed .
good .
it seems your destinies are entwined .
they' re keeping you busy .
i picked this up in the kitchen .
it' s from the reception the other day .
i thought mrs. filipov might like it .
um , she will be thrilled .
that' s very sweet of you .
there' s plenty more if you' re hungry .
you re jewish , aren' t you ?
there' s nothing in our religion that says you can' t eat sturgeon .
my father had a premonition all this would happen .
you mean the war ?
he understood that the hatred of the jews ran deep .
he was saving up to buy some land in palestine .
he said it was the only land we truly belonged in ; the only land we had a duty to defend .
he insisted learn to use a rifle .
i learned to shoot .
i know that in times of war , personal feelings should be put aside , but ...
i have a favor to ask you .
of course .
anything you want .
i want to be reassigned .
what' s happened , tania ?
he shot him .
he shot him even though he jumped first .
shot him on the run .
it was an impossible shot .
i' ve never seen anything like it .
you' ve promised people a victory i can' t deliver .
i don' t stand a chance against this man .
you mustn' t talk like that , vassili .
what if i told you we found a way to track his movements ?
we' ve got someone , vassili .
someone close to him passing us information .
next time you will be one step ahead of him .
i promise .
now i have a favor to ask .
from me ?
it' s about tania .
come in .
he doesn' t even know you exist .
but at that moment , you are closer to him than anyone else on earth .
you see his face through the sight .
you see whether he shaved that morning or not .
you can see whether he' s married by whether he has a wedding ring on .
it' s not like ... just firing at a distant shape , not just a uniform .
it' s a man' s face .
those faces don' t go away .
they come back and they just they get replaced by more faces .
did danilov ask you to tell me this ?
he likes you very much .
i think he' d try anything to change your mind .
did he tell you why i asked for the transfer ?
no .
this morning , a list arrived at headquarters .
it was a list of civilians who' d been ... rounded up and sent to germany in a convoy ... that left stalingrad three weeks ago .
my parents were amongst them .
after 30 kilometers , the german soldiers ... stopped the train and forced everyone out .
in the middle of a bridge , they bound them together , two by two .
mothers with daughters .
husbands and wives .
they ... lined them up against the railing , and then they fired a single shot at each pair ... to save bullets .
it worked .
the bodies of the ones who died dragged the others under the water .
i know they died together .
they never would have let themselves be separated .
that' s koulikov' s rifle .
it' s a good ... rifle .
thank you .
i know how he leaves the shelter .
he goes through the tractor factory .
the tractor factory is big .
i know exactly where .
he crawls through a gutter , under a grate where the vats are , then he goes out from the workshop .
in between the two , there' s a place where he' s in the open .
it' s under a long , iron foot walk .
good luck , comrade .
i know exactly where he' s waiting for me .
he' il be on the foot walk over the gutter .
we' il take him out from behind .
we' il get to the other end of the workshop through these pipes .
follow me .
you go that way .
i' il go around this way .
okay ?
shit !
sergei , you should go back .
no , i' il be all right .
go back .
no , you go !
keep your legs in .
come on .
come on .
come on .
comrade stalin is asking for one last effort !
the fate of the motherland is at risk !
the fate of all those you love and cherish !
it' s for them that we fight today .
listen to me , tania .
the germans are throwing everything at us .
if they' re lucky , one in ten of these soldiers will come back alive .
you' re highly educated .
you know languages .
every intercept you translate saves hundreds of lives .
every message you decode kills thousands of theirs .
you have a duty to survive .
vassili was born to fire a gun .
it' s what he knows .
you and i were born for a different purpose .
if vassili were here , he would tell you the same thing .
where is he ?
where is vassili ?
keep your head down .
tell me where he is .
stay into that pipe , tania .
stay in .
stay in !
get your head in !
slow down .
don' t shoot .
he' s over there .
do you see the pillar in front of you ?
i need you to move round behind it .
go .
tania , i need you to find a large piece of glass .
piece of glass .
do you see the kiln ... behind me to the left of the factory ?
yes ?
i can' t hear you .
yes .
yes .
do you see ... the two louvers ?
yes .
do you see the one ... with a broken slat ?
yes .
this is what i want you to do .
are you ready ?
yes .
three ... two ... one ...
hello , sacha .
he was right where you said he' d be .
nearly there .
he' s very clever .
tell me about him .
why was it his grandfather taught him how to shoot and not his father ?
his father' s dead .
his mother too .
does he talk about his father ?
no .
he didn' t know him .
did he go to school ?
he knows how to write .
he answers lots of letters .
hmm .
is it girls who write to him ?
everyone writes to him .
is there a girl he loves in his village ?
not in his village , here .
does she love him ?
yes , because he' s handsome .
because he' s brave and she' s very beautiful .
i know her well .
she' s from my neighbour hood .
she went to the university .
they' re handsome together .
later , the two of them will get married .
at least , i think so .
and you , sacha , why are you helping the germans ?
because they' re stronger .
because they' re going to win the war .
and because you like chocolate , huh ?
all these people here know they' re gonna die .
so each night when they make it back ,
it' s a bonus .
excuse me .
so , every cup of tea , every cigarette ... becomes a little celebration .
because for a lot of us , it maybe our last night .
it' s just something you have to accept here .
everyone has their time .
in the forest , the wolf lives for three years , the donkey for nine .
so , that' s that' s got to be a proverb from the urals .
it makes no sense to me whatsoever .
the donkey lives longer because he' s more useful .
makes absolute sense .
there aren' t any donkeys in the forest .
you made it up .
so ...
i' m a donkey ?
people like you and danilov ... have to survive this .
people who have read books , had an education .
we' il need you when the war is over .
and if you survive ?
what will the useless vassili zaitsev do then ?
i wanna work in a factory .
my granddad took me to a factory once .
there was this man there , high up on a on a foot walk .
he wasn' t wearing blue like the others .
the people he was supervising didn' t understand what they were doing .
but for him , for him up there , it was simple ; it was clear .
and i thought , " one day , i could be that man .
sad to have a dream you know won' t happen .
why shouldn' t it ?
you' il outlive us all .
hmm .
you' il be the oldest donkey in the forest .
150 meters stand between the germans and the volga .
today the whole world is watching these 150meters .
they are what makes stalingrad ... " the capitol ... of the war .
your friend , tania ... have you see her ?
she stays over there now , with the snipers .
tell the major we' re sending in all of our sharpshooters ... to support the attack on the factory .
tell him vassili will be there .
i need to talk to you .
sure .
i need to talk to you .
sure .
danilov .
hmm ?
you have to stop writing about me .
i' m not gonna get him because i m not good enough .
sooner or later , he' s gonna find me , he' s gonna kill me .
i' ve warned you before not to talk like this .
this time it' s different .
you' ve built me up ... and up into someone i m not .
i can' t carry that weight anymore .
i wanna fight .
i want to fight just as a regular soldier .
i understand .
the thing is , you' re not a regular soldier .
you' re extraordinary .
no , i m what you' ve made me .
nothing more .
why are you telling me this now ?
hmm ?
what' s happened ?
what' s changed ?
did you speak to tania for me ?
yes .
well ... will she reconsider ?
i don' t know .
she should .
she' il be much safer .
she should , you know that .
yeah .
it' il be easier to get her reassigned .
the germans are preparing another offensive in the city center .
the propaganda battle is crucial for morale .
we need you more than ever .
sacha .
hold on .
sacha !
tell him what you know , sacha .
hello , sacha .
there was dust on the major' s boots .
sacha has the major convinced he' s gone over to the other side .
i don' t need to tell you the risk she' s taking .
the dust was yellow .
there' s only one place where there' s dust like that in the back of the chemical factory , a big heap on the tracks .
well done .
sacha ... wait for me outside then .
danilov , hmm ? you had no right to use him .
no , no , i didn' t use him , vassili .
he did it of his own accord .
you know why ?
because he believes in you !
tomorrow morning , we' re going to take back the chemical factory .
sacha' s informed the major you' il be there , so now you know where you have to wait for him .
in the middle of an assault .
i' m following orders .
i suggest you do the same .
now , i m aware of the risks .
you' il be fine .
comrade .
that' s the germans up there .
and yesterday was the russians .
we' re not very far now .
sacha ... you' re playing a very dangerous game .
i want you to win .
see there ?
keep going along the river .
it' s safe ... for a while .
aah !
he' s dead .
we found this on his corpse .
your reason for being here has ceased to exist .
pardon me , herr general , but i do not believe
there is a plane bound for berlin tomorrow evening .
you will be on it .
until then , i must ask you for your dog tags .
imagine how russian propaganda would profit from your death .
if you fall , you will fall unknown .
you' ve already had a near miss .
also please take this war merit cross .
it was awarded posthumously ... to a lieutenant of the 116th infantry division ... who fell here during the first days of the battle . who fell here during the first days of the battle .
he was my son .
if the landing is captured , everything' s lost !
come here .
what did i tell you ?
you' ve been playing your fiddle too much !
if it' s confirmed that he' s dead , we' re sunk !
well , you re sunk .
it isn' t true .
it was intercepted from their staff headquarters .
what do they have to do , dangle his body in front of our men ?
they' re lying .
that' s good .
very good .
write it , then .
vassili zaitsev is not dead .
this is what he had for breakfast this morning .
this is a picture of him reading today' s newspaper . " you' re the poet " .
what ?
you won' t give up the riverbank !
i don t care if you ve lost half your men !
lose the other half , or lose yourself !
is he back ?
he should be back soon .
the german attack cut the lines .
that' s why he' s late .
can we go outside ?
i wrote to my mother about you .
she wanted me to tell you that once this war was over , if there' s anything you needed anything at all our family will be there for you .
you know i m here for you .
they' re saying vassili is dead .
vassili zaitsev will never see his loved ones again .
surrender !
this is your only hope .
you' re upset .
because zaitsev is dead ?
you don' t have to hide it .
there' s no shame in it .
you' re a russian like he is .
don' t listen to them .
it' s just propaganda .
he isn' t dead .
and do you know why ?
because i haven' t killed him yet .
i' m going to tell you a little secret .
only you , because i know i can trust you .
but you must swear to me that you won' t tell another soul .
you swear ?
i found a terrific spot .
it' s by the exit from the train station .
i' il hide in the water tower .
tomorrow .
i' il wait for him there .
you' il see .
he' il be there .
he always is .
i also want you to swear that from now on , you' il stay home where you belong .
do you swear ?
yes ?
good .
we know he' s alive .
we know he won' t fail us .
we know because he is a part of us now .
vassili is eternal .
where have you been ?
we' ve looked everywhere for you .
oh , didn' t you hear ?
i was dead .
at least the noble sniper zaitsev ...
vassili was dead .
the real one .
me ...
i was asleep , and i missed my chance .
then , i was curled up in a corner , hiding ... from a man who wants to kill me .
i' il talk to kruschev .
he' il send you back to your old division .
where' s tania ?
she' s at the shelter .
i' ve been to the shelter .
i told her you weren' t dead .
the major said so .
he said the other germans were lying .
he told me you were waiting for him at the station .
vassili .
vassili .
vassili .
my little sacha .
i knew it .
vassili .
tania .
i knew you weren' t dead .
how ?
because we only just met .
i prayed for the first time since i was a little girl .
when i opened my eyes , sacha was standing there ... waiting to give me the good news .
i think he loves you even more than i do .
to the proper military authority ,
i' m calling to the commandant' s attention the recent changes noticed ... in the attitude towards fighting of soldier vassili zaitsev .
he has attempted on several occasions to escape his duties , voiced doubts on the chances of our victory ... and made defeatist comments in public .
the inexplicable duration of his duel ... with the nazi sharpshooter can only be explained by ... his lack of belief in the communist ideal .
good morning , sacha .
once again , he knew exactly where to find me .
don' t you think that' s strange ?
apart from me , only you knew .
i don' t hold it against you , sacha .
you' ve done a very brave thing .
you' ve chosen your camp .
i respect that .
but it isn' t my camp .
we' re both soldiers , and we' re both enemies , so i know you understand .
i' m annoyed with you , little sacha , for not staying home as i made you swear to .
i' m annoyed with you for obliging me to do what i m going to have to do .
i' ve never seen anyone frown so much in their sleep .
how long have you been watching me ?
all night .
you' ve been snoring away happily for hours .
i don' t snore .
do i ?
like a pig .
i suppose i talk in my sleep as well .
yes .
there' s something i should tell you .
on the train ... coming here ... we were in the same car .
no .
i saw you .
you were reading , and you fell asleep .
i didn' t dare look at you , you were so beautiful .
it was scary .
afterwards , i couldn' t stop thinking about you .
it made me smile .
and then i thought of all the men who would get to hold you ... who' d make you laugh ... how lucky they were .
and now i m the one lying next to you .
and now i m the one lying next to you .
was i snoring ?
like a pig .
what ?
oh , my god !
oh , no .
oh , my god !
tania , no .
tania , no !
no , get off me !
get off me !
get off me !
it' s what he wants !
this is what he wants !
get off me !
no , he' il kill you .
he' il kill you !
let me go !
i' il run after you , and he' il kill me .
let me go !
let me go !
this is what he wants !
i' il get him .
i promise i il get him .
i' il get his rifle for you .
i promise , tania .
i need you .
you have to leave now , mrs. filipov .
stalingrad may fall .
the last of the boats are leaving .
the germans will be here any moment .
he' s brought you a pass .
you' il be safe on the other side .
gather your things , and we' il help you carry them to the landing stage .
i' m not leaving .
this is my home .
this is my sacha' s home .
i can' t leave .
i have to tell you something , mrs. filipov .
something very difficult to understand .
it' s about sacha .
he' s gone over to the germans .
he' s betrayed his country .
he' s with the enemy now .
he won' t be coming back .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
he' s become a traitor .
the poor little thing .
what has he done ?
so , he' s going to stay over there ?
yes ... he' s going to stay over there .
i shouldn' t be saying this , comrade commissar , but maybe it' s for the best .
if the germans have won , he' il be safe .
i know it' s wrong , but perhaps he has made the right choice .
oh !
oh , tania !
tania ?
oh , tania !
tania !
oh , my god !
oh !
i need a doctor !
a doctor !
i have a pass .
i have a pass !
you must let her cross .
please !
it' s useless .
she' il never make it .
no !
no , she will !
she' s my daughter !
she' s my daughter !
i beg of you !
all right .
oh , thank you !
put this one on the boat .
where is he ?
where' s the major ?
a few inches from your face .
i' ve been such a fool , vassili .
man will always be man .
there is no new man .
we tried so hard to create a society that was equal , where there' d be nothing to envy your neighbor .
but there' s always something to envy .
a smile ... a friendship .
something you don' t have and want to appropriate .
in this world even a soviet one there will always be rich and poor .
rich in gifts ... poor in gifts .
rich in love ... poor in love .
tania isn' t coming back .
she' s dead , vassili .
she was cut down by shrapnel .
it was quick .
i don' t think she even saw it coming .
she was on her way back to you .
as soon as she had seen mrs. filipov to the boats , she was coming back for you .
she was right .
you' re a good man , vassili .
i want to help you , vassili .
let me do one last thing .
something useful for a change .
let me show you where the major is .
don' t do that .
don' t do that !
today , february3 , 1943 , is an ominous day for hitler ... and the endless columns of hundreds of thousands of german prisoners .
it is an unforgettable day of hope for our motherland .
after 180 days of heroic combat ... in the market city of stalingrad , and as a result of the valor and self sacrifice of our soldiers , the commander of our glorious red army ... received the unconditional surrender ... of the german fascist invaders .
sorry .
no , young man , i cannot find ...
a matching name in the book .
could you check again ?
this is the address and her name .
she is not here .
yes , this is our address , but we don' t have her anymore .
this is the address .
she' s been here .
i' m so sorry .
she wrote to me .
i looked three times .
she' s not here .
believe me , there is no tania chernova .
i can' t help you .
i' m so sorry .
