i' m looking for a syndicate boy .
it' s the " outfit , " baby .
we don' t say " syndicate " anymore .
you know what i mean .
whatever the hell you call it .
don' t get touchy , porter .
what' s his name ?
val resnick .
oh , that son of a bitch .
you know him ?
yeah .
i met up with him once a few years ago .
he can' t use star service anymore ... because he beats up all the girls ... and he almost killed one .
you ?
does it matter ?
you quit looking after me , remember ?
would you happen to have a line ... on where he might be ?
i suppose he' s at the hotel .
which one ?
the outfit hotel .
they' re all there .
you got an address ?
we' re friends , right ?
i mean , we used to be .
but i' m an employee , too , and i don' t think the outfit ... would like me telling you where the hotel was , would they ?
no .
what do you think i' m gonna do ?
how strong are you , porter ?
personally , i think you are the strongest man ...
i have ever met .
but i wonder if it' s enough .
for what ?
lf i know you ... you want this resnick guy for something he won' t like .
yeah , i' m gonna kill him .
that' s something he won' t like .
what if something goes wrong , and they grab you ... and they ask you where you found out about the hotel ?
why are we even talking about this ?
you know i wouldn' t turn you in .
i wouldn' t talk about who told me what .
but what if they ask you hard ?
i' il i' il tell them it was a cab dispatcher named stegman .
the oakwood arms , union and 17th .
hi , val .
where' s my money ?
no , it' s not there .
i took your gun .
it' s back here .
you look like a pro .
you keep your mouth shut ... and you' il walk out of here .
my 70 grand i want it .
i don' t have it right now .
where is it ?
i gave all 130, 000 to the outfit .
i gave it all to them .
well ... tell them you gave them money that doesn' t belong to you ... and get it back .
now , porter , i can' t do that .
i mean , you don' t know these guy
you' re gonna kill me whether i get the money or not .
all right , i' il get it .
i' il get the money .
just give me a few days , all right ?
what the fuck are you doing ?
noon .
tomorrow .
say it .
all right .
you know , this may sound crazy , porter ... but , uh , no hard feelings , huh ?
i did what i had to do .
you could appreciate that .
yeah , i appreciate that , you
no , no , no .
don' t .
please .
allow me .
jesus .
god .
god .
you bitch !
let her work .
me love you , baby .
me love you long ... time .
wait up , hon .
wait .
tomorrow .
noon .
you and the money ... be at the corner of 7th and franklin ... at the pay phone .
ok .
ok .
where' d you get this ?
hmm ?
some hooker had it on her shelf .
i recognized you .
i swiped it in case i could use it .
did you hurt her ?
huh ?
the hooker did you hurt her ?
what does that have to do with anything ?
i' ve got a few minutes .
so go boil an egg .
uhh !
philip tells me you have a problem ... you need help with .
yes , sir .
ls it your problem who breached our security ...
last night at the oakwood ?
yes , sir .
ahem .
then he breaks into my apartment
there' s an old expression ... that has served me well .
do not shit where you eat .
or " live .
do not shit where you live .
yeah , i like that better .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , mr. carter .
there are 3 ways that we can handle this .
1 we can help you .
2 we can allow you to help yourself .
and 3 we can have you replaced .
we have an investment in you , resnick ... of time , money , and training ... so assisting you would be , in a way ... protecting our investment .
and that is always good business policy .
yes , sir .
yes , sir , mr. carter .
thank you , sir .
you won' t regret it .
now ... according to philip ... a man has come to town to kill you ?
yes .
and you say that he' s alone ... and that he' s a professional robber ... is that correct ?
yes , sir .
he does payroll jobs , banks ... you know , stuff like that .
mm hmm .
what' s his name ?
porter .
well , what' s his first name ?
you know , i don' t know it .
he never called himself anything but porter .
mmm .
where did you get the $130, 000 ?
that' s why this man has come to town , huh ?
the $130, 000 that you paid us back ?
yes , sir , but only 70, 000 of it was his .
well , we never asked you where you got the money .
it' s none of our business ... but now it appears it has become our business .
here' s his file , mr. carter .
do you understand your value ... to the organization , resnick ?
you' re a sadist .
you lack compunction .
that comes in handy .
but now you' ve allowed an area ... of your personal life to become a danger to us .
a man in our organization needs to be tough ... and self reliant .
were you to handle this problem on your own ... there would be no doubt ... that you' re the kind of man we want .
i want to .
ahem .
i want to handle it myself , mr. carter .
great .
until the matter is handled ...
i want you to move out of the oakwood arms .
uh , ahem , but i don' t have a place , uh
i don' t want anymore unpleasantness at the hotel .
yes , sir .
excuse me for saying so , mr. carter ... but it might be easier if resnick just disappeared .
i thought about that ... but i' m not worried about resnick .
he wouldn' t last 2 minutes out on the street without us .
it' s that other mutt i' m thinking about .
what' s his name ?
porter .
takes a lot of moxie to walk right into the outfit ... and start whacking our guys around .
either that , or he' s shit nuts .
frankly , i don' t understand it for $130, 000 .
70, 000 .
his share .
that' s even worse .
i don' t want mr. bronson hearing about this .
he' il think i' m getting soft .
one of his principles has always been ...
lf you don' t understand it , get rid of it .
a stitch in time , so to speak , so ... stitch this mutt up , phil .
any polaroids or trophies ?
no , not this time .
yeah ?
they cut me loose , pearl .
just like i thought they would .
hold on one second .
shut up !
i' m on the fucking phone !
yes ?
did your friends make it to town ?
oh , yeah .
last night , baby .
good .
now , did you tell them ... it was porter took their payroll ?
i did .
and they want retribution .
all right .
all right , here' s what we do .
ho ho .
yeah , that' s porter .
he' s shit for brains .
oh , shit .
shit !
next time , porter .
looks like porter' s made some new friends .
easy , mister .
i' m ok .
i don' t want to press charges .
who were they , huh , pal ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
oh , man .
oh , it' s you guys .
our buddy stegman says you got a line ... on a load of cash there , porter .
250 grand , to be exact .
70 .
come on , man .
get off of me .
all right , all right , all right .
what do you take us for , huh ?
ldiots ?
nobody' d go through all this shit for 70 grand .
we don' t like trouble , buddy .
you look like a whole bunch of trouble to us .
we found a dead girl full of heroin .
there were signs of a struggle ... and the coroner' s not so sure it was an o. d.
we got a witness , though .
a guy with only one nostril .
remember him ?
uh huh .
hey , don' t worry , porter .
we' re gonna give you immunity .
room to operate , " get out of jail free " card .
all you got to do is get the money .
oh , we can' t help you , though .
it' d be against the law .
you understand , porter ?
it' s my money .
wrong , porter .
huh ?
it' s our money , porter .
me and my partner' s money .
you be a good boy , we' il give you a piece .
we' il be easy , porter .
you got it ?
yeah , he' s got it .
you understand ?
you take it easy , huh ?
we' il be in touch .
sure , thanks .
what a dope .
fuck .
crooked cops .
did they come any other way ?
lf i had been just a little dumber ...
i could have joined the force myself .
jesus christ , porter ... you need to see a doctor .
yeah .
it' s gonna sting .
just clean it up , all right ?
you hold it there .
yeah , right .
i' il do it .
tell me something , porter .
when did you decide to leave ?
was it that night we slept together ?
no .
it was the next day when i had to drive you to work .
you could have asked me to quit .
you could have asked me to drive you somewhere else .
hubba hubba hubba .
thanks .
does it fit ?
oh , yeah ...
like it was made for me .
it' il look great in your casket .
you know what i think ?
i think that , uh ... all those stories about you being dead were true .
you' re just too thick headed to admit it .
porter .

oh , no , i ...

porter .
porter .

the outfit is not unreasonable , porter ... but no corporation in the world ... would agree to what you' re asking .

will he give me my money ?
resnick told you quite a bit , didn' t he ?
fairfax will tell you the same thing i have .
we' re not authorized to do things like this .

a committee would make a decision in this case .
no .
one man .
you go high enough , you come to one man .

yes .
mr. bronson ...
i have mr. carter on the line .
put him through .

are you out of your fuckin ' mind ?
you just dug your own grave .
i don' t see any cash .
they write you a check ?
they gave me the run around .
i have to go and see another guy .
last one , then we got a dead woman , an assault ... and all kinds of stuff to talk to you about .
that means more paperwork , porter ... and we don' t like paperwork .
damn shame , porter .
don' t let the bastards get you down .
that' s right , porter .
don' t give up .
hey , can i have my piece back ?
oh , yeah .
nice roscoe , porter .
heavy enough to be a nutcracker .
we' il be in touch , rocky .
keep up the good work !
nobody likes a monkey on their back .
i had 3 ... and they were cramping my style .
i was gonna have to lighten the load .
porter .

i' ve just been taking care of business .
you know , evening up the odds a little .
these guys aren' t gonna stop until they kill us ... are they ?
no .
i' m sorry .
sorry i got you involved in this .
so why did you ?
you' re a clever guy .
you didn' t need me .
so why did you ?
yeah , you' re right .
when i came back ...
i came back here with nothing .
no life .
no hope .
you were the only good thing in my life ... that hadn' t been taken from me .
i couldn' t stay away .
i had to see you ... just to make sure i wasn' t in hell .
so why don' t we get out of here ?
we can' t .
why ?
well , you said it .
they' re not gonna stop until they bury us .

no .
i want you to do me a favor .
call mr. bronson ... see what we can do about getting my money back .
well ... he let carter die .
but that poor buck toothed bastard' s ... probably better off dead anyway .
he' d probably let me die , too .
no , with carter , he thought i was bluffing .
try him .
you might find him more receptive than you think .
all right .
you two are fired .
hello .
well , it' s like this ...
i' m standing in my living room ... and there' s a man here named porter ... who says that he expects you ... to pay him sooner or later .
yes , of course .
he wants to talk to you .
put it on the speaker .
this is porter .
you got balls , porter .
you' re proving to be a real pain in the ass ... a mosquito .
to get rid of you , i' il swat you with 130 grand .
ah .
it' s not 130
hey , what the hell are you doing , man ?
fairfax ?
fairfax .

oh , it' s all right .
he' s just killing my alligator bags ... and shooting holes in my suits .
that' s just mean .
that' s mean , man .
you people aren' t listening .
it' s not 130 gr
no , you listen .
i' il get you your money ... but you' re never gonna live to enjoy it .
you let me worry about that .
here' s the deal .
i want you to deliver the money yourself .
you' re one hell of an optimist .
what in the world makes you think ...
i' m gonna deliver the money myself ?
well , if you don' t ... you' il never see little johnny again .
didn' t come home from the fight last night ... did he ?
he' s a good looking kid ... but you indulge him too much .
i told him so .
bullshit .
you haven' t got him .
you wouldn' t be that stupid .
my dad never bought me a ferrari .
i had to steal my first one .
nice inscription on the key chain .
a little sappy .
