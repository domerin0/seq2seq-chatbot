rocky balboa is in serious trouble .
he' s gettin ' killed out there .
drago continuing to punish rocky balboa .

rocky' s been hit with bombs .
rocky' s hurt .
a right hand from drago sends rocky balboa 15 feet across the ring .
come on .
get up !
it' s been a one sided fight so far .
and drago throws a hard right hand that stuns rocky balboa .
they might have to stop this one before somebody gets killed .
rocky taking punishment .
he is completely exhausted .
and balboa goes down again from a right hand .
punch after punch .
amazing willpower !
rocky balboa has taken ivan drago' s best punches so far .

everything' s ok .
what' s wrong ?
what' s wrong ?
remember when mick said when he was fighting sometimes , he' d fight so hard that he was thinking that he broke something inside ?
he was gonna die ?
and that' s what he said , that' s when the angels was pulling on him .
rocky , you' re scaring me .
i don' t know what' s wrong .
i can' t ...
can' t what ?
i can' t stop my hands from shaking .
i ain' t never felt this thing .
you better see a doctor .

airport security .
welcome home .
there' s a press reception inside .
rocky , how did you feel about the russian people ?
you know , very good .
they was great people .
i didn' t understand what they said all the time , but i knew what they meant .
mrs balboa , did you learn any russian ?
did i learn russian ?
yeah , she got fluent in vodka .
rocky , there are rumours of physical complications .
complications ?
no , those were rumours .
he' s in perfect physical condition .
rocky , the american medical association has recommended that boxing be banned .
yeah .
do you agree with the doctors ?
yeah , absolutely .
i think that doctors should never fight .
that was a beautiful answer , champ .
doctors should stay out of the ring .
doctors should never fight .
rocky balboa , the funniest champion ever .
america' s own rocky balboa !
how are ya ?
george washington duke , promoter extraordinaire , welcomes rocky balboa , champion of all the americas and all of the russias .
i would like to digress from the questions a bit and pose a proposition to the media .
everyone in this city and in the world of sports knows my reputation for promoting some of the finest extravaganzas in this country .
well now , with the press present , i' d like to ask you , rocky balboa , to be the flamboyant , rambunctious sportsman we know you can be .
give this man , union cane , a chance to challenge you for the heavyweight championship .
balboa , i want the opportunity to take what you got .
isn' t it bad timing to challenge , duke ?
the man just got off the plane .
timing is the essence of life , gentlemen and ladies .
now what i have on this paper is the largest guarantee ever offered to a champion on this planet .
i' m talking about a fantastic international extravaganza , to be held in japan , called lettin ' it go in tokyo .
it' s incredible .
only in america do people like us rise from oppression and poverty to join hands in this international event .
excuse me .
only in america !
excuse me .
my husband is retired .
he has nothing more to prove .
wait a minute !
hey , rocky ...
don' t you consider this a public responsibility to respond now ?
respond to the people .
isn' t this about professionalism ?
to talk about it now , not later .
do you mind if i heal first ?
you got nothin ' like what i got for you .
what the hell does this all mean ?
that isn' t enough .
we gotta know now .
gotta think about that .
so anyway ,
i wanna tell everybody that the flight over was really nice .
come on , guys .
we need more .
adrian , if you weren' t with me ,
i never woulda done as good .
you' re always there .
and my kid , having you is like being born all over again .
come on .
are you gonna retire or not ?
anyway , excuse me .
i' d like to go home .
give us something to write .
thanks very much .
i appreciate it .

don' t worry .
we' il get him .
no , really .
it' s great .
look at this place !
i swear i ain' t never leavin ' this place again , you know that ?
hey , would you like to dance ?
how about a homecoming dance for your old man ?
no , don' t be silly .
it' s cold .
i' il warm you up , young lady .

hurry up .
the music' s almost over .
do you like the song ?
you should rest .
yeah , i know .
i' m tired .
come on .
maybe i' il take you upstairs and violate you like a parkin ' meter .
cost you a quarter .
yo , adrian !
where' d you learn to talk dirty like that ?
uncle paulie , you notice something strange about dad ?
he just took a few hard shots .
i think you tell better jokes than me , adrian .
did i hear somebody call for their old man ?
did you do this ?
sleep time , kid , ok ?
dad , did you know your bones grow three times as fast at night ?
no , i didn' t , but i heard somethin ' like that .
is that me ?
oh yeah , that' s you .
excellent !
is that me ?
when we was fishin ' , right ?
yeah .
that' s beautiful !
look at the tent .
you know , the fish was a lot bigger , if i recall .
actually , that was a lot smaller .
anyway , come on .
hit the bed .
it' s time for you to get healthy .
this is great .
i don' t know where you learned this .
it is something how this thing comes out of your fingers and ...
oh my god .
who' s this ?
it' s madame dupont , my french teacher .
really ?
yeah .
she looks french , sure .
i wouldn' t show this to your mother , cos she don' t understand french too good .
god .
better cover that one up .
well , champ , it' s bedtime .
hey , you know what ?
i know some french talk .
knock , knock .
who' s there ?
madame .
madame who ?
ma damn foot' s caught in the door !
that' s an old joke .
what do you want from me ?
i' m trying .
i don' t know all the good things , you know ?
what' s this ?
what ?
look what i found in your ear .
russian money .
money ears !
all right .
anyway , listen .
you gotta get some sleep .
dad ?
today , when you said having me was like being born again ...
yeah ?
what did you mean ?
well , you know , you come up like i did and you got , like , three square meals of zero a day , know what i mean ?
you got the a side of life and the b side .
i' m on the b side , but you ... you got all the breaks .
so when i see you having all these things that i didn' t have ,
i , like , live through your eyes .
i enjoy it a little bit .
it' s like having it all over again .
that' s nice .
hey , look in my face .
do i look like a raccoon ?
a little bit .
like rocky raccoon ?
yeah , a little bit .
nah !
yeah , you do a little .
really ?
hey , if you think i look bad , you oughta see the other guy' s knuckles .
anyway , yo .
good night .
ok , kid ?

dad ?
yo ?
glad you' re home .
thanks .
i appreciate it .
we' il play tomorrow , ok ?
maybe you can show me your english teacher .
she' s pretty hot , too .
nah !
good night , kid .
you deserve the worst for what you did .
that was rocky' s money .
you wanna be hysterical ?
you cost us everything .
it was a mistake .
you think i thought this was gonna happen ?
don' t you walk away from me .
you just gave up our life !
and you think it' s some stupid thing ?
paulie , do you know what you did ?
do you know how serious it is ?
i understand it !
i understand the whole freakin ' thing !
i understand it .
your accountant' s a crook , not me !
i did what i thought was right .
don' t blame me .
i want to murder the bum worse than anybody .
adrian , what' s wrong ?
look what you done now .
she' s dumpin ' it all on me .
come on , don' t turn this around on me .
what did you do ?
he gave power of attorney to our accountant .
i just didn' t gave anything to nobody .
he sent a letter .
he says " we' il be in russia a couple of months and i need rocky to sign a tax extension " .
that extension was a power of attorney , paulie !
he' s the thief !
i need alcohol .
rocky , on my eyes , i never stole a freakin ' dime .
adrian , what' s happenin ' here ?
it' s gone .
what' s gone ?
the money .
the money .
everything .
it' s all gone .
the piece of paper paulie had you sign wasn' t a request for a tax extension .
it was a blanket power of attorney in favour of the accountant , who was involved in some high priced real estate .
he thought he could have your money back before you knew it was gone .
unfortunately for you and everybody in this room , his deals fell through because the market dried up .
and you lost millions .
ain' t there nothin ' i can do ?
i' ve filed eight criminal acts against him .
but you' ve got debt payment on this property , he didn' t pay your tax returns and your mortgage hasn' t been paid in months .
we didn' t have a mortgage .
our house was fully paid for .
don' t take it from me .
ask him .
there' s nearly $400, 000 outstanding .
the only thing that is not encumbered is a gym , willed to your son by a mickey goldmill in 1982 .
you can sell things .
remember those commercials you did ?
i ain' t no commercial kinda guy .
i' m a fighter .
that' s what i do .
no , we couldn' t get sponsors .
with the investigation of the accountant , out pops a criminal record of rocky' s for assault .
but that was a long time ago .
he didn' t know ...
why not a couple more fights ?
with your popularity , you' d be out in no time .
he' s retiring .
rocko , fighting' s the ticket .
i said he' s retired !
paulie , we' re here because of you .
i' m not taking the heat for all this .
i thought i was doing smart business .
you thought you did smart business ?
hey !
the accountant was your choice .
you shoulda known he was a thief , but in your fairy tale world the air don' t move .
you' re like a season that don' t change .
hey , enough .
i' m not no tomato can you kick around .
you call duke .
tell him i' il fight cane .
i don' t care .
anywhere , any time .
no .
rocky , no !
if that' s what you want , i' il get on it .
rocky , please .
a couple of fights , we' re outta trouble .
yeah , but you said ...
no , i didn' t say anything .
did we come this far to lose it ?
you have to see a doctor .
i don' t need a doctor .
i need a promoter .
if the doctor says ok , i' il support you .
i gotta fight , ok ?
i got problems .
i gotta fight .
will you do it for me ?
all right .
for you .
because of continuous violent blows to the head , you have a condition particular to boxers called cavum septum pellucidum , which is a hole in the membrane separating the ventricles .
the brain surface neurons in this area have also been traumatised .
simply stated , mr balboa , it means that you have suffered damage to the brain .
how long until he recovers ?
the effects are irreversible .
rocky , you have to retire .
i don' t wanna retire .
this ain' t the time to retire .
not in here , not in no office .
i just fought the best fight of my life .
i just did that , you know ?
and all i need is a couple more .
no .
you suffered severe brain trauma .
he could be wrong .
anybody could be wrong .
he ain' t god .
adrian , only god ain' t wrong .
rocky , this is what' s good for you .
i only need a couple of easy ones .
not the way it is .
you can' t get licensed in any state .
he can' t , can he , doctor ?
that is correct .
rocky , do you love me ?
yeah , i love you .
why do you ask that ?
because if you love somebody , you live with them , you live for them .
you don' t gamble with a life .
rocky , i don' t care about the money .
it' s you .
that' s all that matters .
please .
we' il be ok .
we' il be fine .
no one has to know , doctor , right ?
it' il be strictly confidential .
thank you .
may we hear our next bid , please ?
are you done ?
sold .
moving along , ladies and gentlemen .
item number 46 ...
hey , kid .
bike' s been sold .
hey , bike' s been sold .
get off the bike .
come on .
don' t worry about it .
we been down before .
i' il get it all back .
we just gotta stick together , hey ?
home team .
yeah , right .
come on .
you know , mickey used to say a fight ain' t over till you heard the bell .
we ain' t heard a bell yet , have we ?
rocky balboa' s boxing gloves from his first fight ...
rocky ?
hey , it still fits .
why are you wearin ' those clothes ?
i was just going through some stuff and i found them .
they feel kinda comfortable .
i was looking all over for you downstairs .
it' s kind of depressing .
yeah , i know what you mean .
what' s this doin ' in your ear ?
oh , god !
remember these ?
yeah .
i remember when you took ' em off .
that' s right .
first time i ever kissed you .
adrian , i wanna go out for a bit .
you know , just take a little walk .
i just wanna feel better .
but hey , could you talk to the kid ?
cos he' s really taking this hard .
sure .
where are you going ?
i thought i' d go to andy' s .
he used to be a champion .
how did he blow it all ?
how you doing , mick ?
slip the jab .
slip the jab !
that' s right .
that' s it .
hey , i didn' t hear no bell !
ok .
all right !
that' s right .
slip the jab .
that' s it .
mentalise !
see that bum in front of you .
you see yourself doing right , and you do right .
that' s pretty .
that' s very pretty .
time !
come here , rock .
my god , you' re ready , ain' t ya ?
apollo won' t know what hit him .
you' il roll over him like a bulldozer .
an italian bulldozer .
you know , kid , i know how you feel about this fight that' s comin ' up .
because i was young once , too .
i tell you somethin ' .
why , if you wasn' t here ,
i probably wouldn' t be alive today .
the fact that you' re here and doing as well as you' re doing gives me ...
what do you call it ?
a motivisation to stay alive .
cos i think that people die sometimes when they don' t wanna live no more .
nature' s smarter than people think .
and nature is smarter than people think .
what the hell am i living around here for ?
i got no reason to go on " .
but with you , kid ...
boy , i got a reason to go on .
and i' m gonna stay alive .
and i will watch you make good .
and i' il never leave you .
i' il never leave you until that happens .
cos when i leave you , you' il not only know how to fight , you' il be able to take care of yourself outside the ring , too .
is that ok ?
it' s ok .
ok .
i got a gift for you .
ah , mickey .
wait a minute now .
really , i don' t need nothin ' .
look at that .
see that ?
this here' s the favourite thing that i have on this earth .
and rocky marciano give me that .
you know what it was ?
his cuff link .
and now i' m giving it to you .
and it' s gonna be like ...
like an angel on your shoulder to you .
and if you ever get hurt and you feel that you' re goin ' down , this little angel is gonna whisper in your ear .
he' s gonna say " get up , you son of a bitch !
cos mickey loves you " .
ok ?
thanks , mick .
i love you , too .
jesus .
go after him , kid .
go after him .
thanks .
you was the angel .
there it is .
what happened to his other cuff link ?
i don' t know .
he only give me one .
he gave it to some bum .
careful .
don' t worry about these .
all right , let' s go , paulie .
i really can' t believe it .
this kid' s taking this too good .
hey , rock , it' s good i kept the place , right ?
it saves money .

it' s only temporary , you know ?
come on inside .
hello ?
mrs balboa ?
george washington duke here .
yes ?
mrs balboa , can you hear it ?
listen close .
you must be able to hear it .
hear what ?
the sound of the parade going by , of opportunity knocking .
what' il take to get you to realize
i' m givin ' you a chance to pull yourselves together ?
let me handle your husband' s career and you can live like human beings again .
listen , mr duke , we' re living like human beings .
you oughta try it some time .
and leave my husband alone .
women !
when' d you start that ?
i don' t know .
it' s like a bad habit that comes back .
but , hey !
we ain' t talkin ' about me .
we' re talkin ' about you .
hey , rocky , how you doin ' , man ?
good to see you back .
thanks .
great to be back .
you' re smart in school , but you gotta be smart on the street , too .
how do you mean ?
you gotta know who the players are
and who you' re talkin ' to .
watch out for scams .
everyone scams .
what' s a scam ?
ask your father .
a scam is like a hustle .
he don' t get it .
well , a hustle' s related to ...
rocky !
remember me ?
i' m bubba' s mother .
oh , yeah .
you used his head for a punchin ' bag .
yeah , he had a nice head .
anyway , a hustle' s related to a con .
he don' t get it .
a deception ?
you' re saying beware of deceptions .
yeah , that' s good .
absolutely .
you' re very smart , you know ?
ain' t this where the atomic hoagy shop used to be ?
i' m new here , dad .
this neighbourhood' s got tooth decay .
it' s called urban blight .
i' il tell you somethin ' , this place is blightin ' everywhere .

what do you think ?
anyway , we' re late for school .
paulie , i wanna talk to the kid private like .
like i got no feelings .
oh , come on .
that' s how wars start .
relax , would you ?
so anyway , everybody' s got an angle .
tough break , rock .
everybody' s got a hustle .
these kids have got street brains .
that' s how they live .
these kids ain' t like no personalities that you' ve grown up with .
so you gotta stay very sharp round here .
i intend to .
intend !
you know , sometimes you make me feel very stupid .
why ?
why ?
cos you' re smarter than me .
no , i' m not .
yeah , you are .
it' s like every day you learn somethin ' new and i forget somethin ' new .
but hey , listen .

if you can figure out how to fix things up , don' t be afraid to tell me .
we gotta stick together , cos what are we ?

oh , home team .
home team !
you' ve got that right .
i used to go to this school when i was a kid .

but i think you can handle it , don' t you think ?
if you went here , i can go here .
i' m not scared really .
really ?
well , i guess i' m a little scared .
but that' s normal , don' t you think ?
oh , yeah .
i had 72 fights ... .. and every one of ' em i was scared , so yeah , you know , that' s real , real normal .
i' il see you later .

he ain' t used to livin ' like this .
he don' t know the streets .
at school , i know what' s gonna happen .
some wise guy' s gonna come up to him cos he' s my kid and try to bang him out .

what' d you say ?
it' s blight .
urban blight .
george wants you to consider wearing gloves again .
it' s a helluva payday .
i' m officially expired .
you have marquee value .
you put asses into seats .
a businessman don' t retire if he can still pull in the bread .
only america gives these opportunities .
union cane' s going for the title .
here' s some tickets .
we' ve a strong feeling about this .
if he takes it , that' s the time to challenge .
people love comebacks .
there' s nothing more commercial than a long shot comeback of a down on his luck underdog .
virtue has never been as respectable as money " .
who' s twain ?
a painter .
you' re the great white hope .
you mean great white dope .
no , forget it .
hold the bullshit .
i know the problem .
you think i was born yesterday ?
merlin , show him the paper .
this is your medical report .
we can work around it .
where' d you get this ?
it doesn' t matter .
if you fight cane , george can guarantee to get you a license .
guaranteed .
you can do this ?
no problem .
this comeback' s in the bag .
the time' s hot .
the deal' s hot .
caliente !
we could use one more payday .
adrian , where' d you come from ?
mrs balboa just appeared !
she' s magic .
i don' t think you' re funny .
are you talking him into fighting ?
talking business , darlin ' .
do you like feelin ' hard up ?
do you like reachin ' in your pocket and only feelin ' your leg ?
i didn' t think so .
i' m offering you the opportunity to dump this loser image .
who are you talking to ?
you ain' t workin ' across ...
what the hell are you talkin ' about ?
this is a tremendous opportunity .
opportunity for who ?
for you to make money ?
for him to be disabled ?
what would you do if the choices were reversed ?
you have to think about that .
rocky , they don' t care about you .
let' s get serious .
you represent the dreams of the long shots .
the little people identify with you .
that is the key to public success .
you a true champion , a true product of the people .
sell it while they' il still buy .
that ain' t gonna last forever .
you say you a fighter , then fight !
and i' il make you so much money you can swim in it .
you can swim , can' t you ?
whaddaya say ?
put some hustle behind this muscle .
he' s done .
he' s done fighting !
you are a damn fool .
maybe we oughta sign mrs balboa to fight cane , huh ?
looks like she' s the one with the cojones in the family .
you don' t talk like that in front of my wife .
that ain' t no park bench , boy .
i' il get him .
rocky , i' m really sorry .
i didn' t wanna ...
you guys want privacy ?
i' il be upstairs .
rocky .
rocky , i' m sorry .
i ...
but it just takes one bad hit and you could be an invalid .
i feel like an invalid already .
why' d you come back ?
you' re too smart for this .
i got nothing to do .
i called gloria .
she said she could use part time help .
but why do you wanna do this ?
why go back to where you started ?
i gotta do it , but you don' t gotta do it !
i wanted to be there so i could be close to you .

you know , it' s gettin ' cold out here .
maybe we better get inside , ok ?
i understand .

i need an angle .
i' il fight balboa right now .
i' m better than balboa ever was .
hey !

i don' t want you blaming me for this , kid , you know ?
here' s what i would do if i was you .
listen to me .
if i was you ,
i would go home and talk to your family people .
come up with somethin ' better .
i got no family people .
all i got is what you see here .
i know all about you , back from your first fight with apollo creed .
i read about how no one ever gave you a chance .
i' m not from the same streets as you , but i' m hungry , like you were .
ever since i put on gloves i' ve wanted to meet you .
cos i knew that if anybody could make me a winner , it was you .
hey , paulie , you see a winner standing here ?
yes !
man , you beat the best .
nobody could ever say different .
look , rocky , you don' t know me , but anything you want me to do , i' il do .
and if i can' t , i' il bust my butt tryin ' .
i' m not hustlin ' you , man .
all i' m askin ' for is a chance .
i mean , just one shot .
are you hungry ?
yeah .
yeah ?
come on .
you' re really gonna like the way adrian cooks .
she does amazing things with macaroni , especially tomatoes .
but i gotta warn you , she can be a little vicious with the garlic !
so why' d this kid smack your face ?
it really doesn' t matter , dad .
it does matter .
they took his coat .
i don' t want the coat .
they took the one with the collar ?
i' il go to your school and ...
you' il make it worse .
can' t i do what i think is right ?
what do you think is right ?
a baseball bat across the face .
paulie !
adrian , can i have the plate ?
yes , rocky .
i had trouble like that when i was in school .
" pretend the guy' s like a balloon " .
balloon ?
she said if you pop ' em hard , these guys just go away .
tommy , we' re trying to raise our son so he can handle his problems with his mind , not his muscles .
sorry .
that' s why i' il get mangled .
you ain' t gonna get mangled .
dad , will you teach me how to fight ?
a baseball bat would be nice .
do you wanna grow up and just use your fists ?
adrian , i don' t think it' d be so bad if i taught him how to throw a few ... deadly punches .
tommy , did your dad teach you to fight ?
no , not exactly .
i had to ...
sweetheart , don' t get personal .
no , it' s ok .
you see , my old man , he used to drink a lot .
seriously .
he' d go out with his friends , then he' d come home , look to punch on me .
he' d punch on my mother , too .
he did that a lot of times .
so growing up , i only thought about fightin ' my father .
you know , when i was 1 3 , i got in trouble at school .
he tied me down and whipped me so bad i couldn' t walk for a week .
i couldn' t do anything .
the first guy i ever knocked out was my father .
in the ring , it' s like all i see is him .
that' s kinda sick , huh ?
yo , tommy , at least you had an old man to knock out , you know ?
yeah .
i didn' t even have that .
some day you can punch out your pop .
paulie , what you telling him that for ?
it' s the fittest of the survival .
tommy , where you stayin ' tonight ?
oh , i' il find some place to stay .
no , i tell you what .
we got room down in the basement .
what about me ?
your son is sleeping there .
well , he can stay with his uncle .
what am i , a pit stop ?
i don' t wanna cause any problems .
i can find a place to stay .
no , it' s ok .
it' s just for a little while , you know .
right ?
no problem at all .
hey , kid .
i appreciate it .
it' s cold outside .
i' m not changing no sheets .
hey , since when have you ever ?
tommy , why don' t you come on down ?
we' il show you the whole place .
why don' t you go downstairs and show your father what you did today ?
hey , junior !
your plumbing don' t leak , do it ?
you know this guy ?
yeah .
he hits hard .
adrian can really cook !
yeah , she' s ok .
listen , tommy .
we ain' t had a chance to get this place too nice .
we' il get it together in a while , you know ?
wow !
man , this is what it' s about .
holy mackerel !
why do you keep this stuff down here ?
when did you get a chance to do this ?
he took it all out of a box .
it' s beautiful .
you painted ...
when did you get a chance to do this , kid ?
after school .
it' s no big deal .
where' d you get the glove ?
oh , this ?
thanks .
this is one of my favourite objects .
mickey give me this before he departed .
it was rocky marciano' s cuff link .
really ?
the real rocky marciano ?
you got me thinkin ' about mickey .
i wanna show you something .
he told me a long time ago ...
he says that fighting is like 90 % in the skull and 10 % in the body .
this is what he says to me .
dad , i met this really nice girl today .
really ?
that' s wonderful .
she' s a lot better than ...
wait a minute .
don' t change the station .
i' il be right back .
i just wanna tell tommy a few things .
hey , who was your best friend back in orlando ?
that' s oklahoma .
well , yeah .
eric elder .
no , no .
your best friend is a guy named frankie fear .
you see , fear is a fighter' s best friend .
it ain' t nothin ' to be ashamed of .
you see , fear keeps you sharp .
it keeps you awake .
it makes you wanna survive .
but the thing is , you gotta learn how to control it .
cos fear is like this fire and it' s burning deep inside .
now , if you control it , tommy , it' s gonna make you hot .
but , you see , if this thing here controls you , it' s gonna burn you and everythin ' else around you up .
that' s right .
anyway , these are the things that was taught to me and , if you want , i' d like to teach to you .
this mean you' re gonna manage me ?
absolutely .
hey , home team .
all right !
let' s go for it .
do you mind showin ' me a few things ?
sure , tommy .
i' il show you a lot of things .
hey , rich boy .
how much you got in your pocket today ?
nothin ' .
come on , let' s have it .
i got nothin ' .
come on , gimme the money .
come on !
hey , i gotta eat .
he' s hungry , he' s gotta eat .
well , eat this .
i got it .
go !
father carmine !
father carmine !
maybe he' s not home .
priests is always home .
i didn' t wanna disturb you that much , father .
oh , excellent .
everything is perfect .
father , this is my new friend , tommy gunn .
i was wondering ...
tommy here' s a fighter and i' m his manager .
i wondered if you' d do me a favour , if you ain' t busy .
could you throw us a couple blessings ?
one , that i don' t mess up as a manager .
and b , that tommy does as good as i think he can do : great .
and don' t get hurt none .
could you do that ?
i love it when he does that .
thanks , father !
really appreciate this .
any time .
ok .
i' il see you in church .
hey , man , what' d you do this for ?
it don' t hurt havin ' an angel on your side .
hey , rock .
how' s it going ?
doin ' great , guys .
slow down or you' il get a ticket !
this is tommy gunn .
he' il be a champ .
how you doin ' , tom ?
all right , break it up .
break !
get off the ropes !
go easy .
man , i need more work .
no , you' re ready .
no , this guy' s killing me .
you' re ready now .
you' re perfect .
he' s killing me .
i feel weak .
no , listen to me .
shut up !
mick used to say the only difference between a hero and a coward is the hero' s willing to go for it .
take the shot .
this guy here is scared too .
you' re both scared .
remember in the basement we talked about fear ?
how it was like this fire ?
you gotta control it or it burns you up .
or it' s gonna burn him up .
make it work for you , tommy .
i would never do nothin ' to hurt you , understand ?
fear is like this fire , ok ?
now let it burn until it becomes like this volcano .
when you see the openin ' , explode all over this guy , ok ?
now , you can take him , ok ?
it ain' t all muscle , it' s all heart .
heart and fire !
ok , now you do it .
remember , i' m like this angel on your shoulder .
i ain' t gonna let nothin ' happen to you .
go for it .
come on , tommy .
jab !
left , right !
the body !
