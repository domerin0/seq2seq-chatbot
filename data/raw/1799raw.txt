these were the scenes everyone feared .
running battles between english and turkish fans ...
... some here have been seriously injured .
... it' s very violent indeed .
earlier , there was mayhem on the main square ...
getting beaten up by football hooligans is like having vd : the fuckin ' pain goes on forever .
but that' s what makes it so exciting .
so this is me , tommy johnson three weeks from now , nearly dead .
and do you know what the funniest thing is ?
i could see it coming .
anyway , it' s almost over now and all that matters is this : was it worth it ?
there' s nothing different about me .
i' m just ahother bored male approaching 30 , in a dead end job who lives for the weekend .
casual sex , watered down lager , heavily cut drugs .
and occasionally kicking fuck out of someone .
zeberdee , it' s bill .
what ?
how am i ?
what do you mean , " how am i " ?
i' m fuckin ' buzzin ' !
we' ve gone right through the slit .
keep your fuckin ' nut down .
he' s a right fuckin ' stringer , this kid .
what' s he say ?
nothing .
what do you mean , " nothing " ?
he fuckin ' hung up .
raff , call tommy .
find out where he is .
there' s a pub on the corner called the ship and billet .
head for that .
i' il have to bell you back , harris is trying to get through .
just spotted their little firm going to a pub in denbigh street .
they won' t know what' s fuckin ' hit ' em .
there you are .
here , come here !
sweet , bill ?
yeah .
where' s the others ?
on their way .
harris said there' s about 25 of the others .
there won' t be when we' ve finished with ' em .
wait round the corner !
what for ?
cos it' s all going to be on top , us all standin ' here , you si .
jog on .
jog on !
bill , it' s harris .
hello , son .
yeah ?
all right .
see you there .
what happened to you last night ?
thought you was coming out for a drink ?
johnson had me on some nutty skunk .
ended up down the petrol garage at two o' clock in the morning .
what you driving for ?
you' re on a ban , you lunatic .
ban ?
what am i gonna do , walk ?
here he is .
right , there' s someone outside the pub .
how old is he ?
he' s only a kid .
go on , crack him .
keep the noise down .
keep the noise down .
excuse me , mate , you got a light ?
don' t fuck about , ping him .
let' s go !
it' s going good anyway .
let' s settle it .
come on , let' s ...
keep it down , keep it down .
keep it down .
fuckin ' hell , come on , boys .
keep it down , keep it down .
come on .
fuckin ' hell .
keep it down .
don' t fuck this up .
fuckin ' clowns won' t stop us .
you' re fuckin ' animals !
you give this fuckin ' country a bad fuckin ' name !
you ain' t no football supporters !
you' re fuckin ' muggy little cunts !
what else are you gonna do on a saturday ?
sit in your fuckin ' armchair wankin ' off to pop idols ?
then try and avoid your wife' s gaze as you struggle to come to terms with your sexless marriage ?
then go and spunk your wages on kebabs fruit machines and brasses ?
fuck that for a laugh !
i know what i' d rather do .
tottenham away .
love it !
how fuckin ' perfect was that ?
soppy bollocks here even managed to get the canister inside the fuckin ' pub this time .
do you remember that time at upton ...
that time at upton park , he let it off on the tube !
mind you , premature ejaculation , that' s right up your fuckin ' street !
anyway , he' s virtually throwing ' em out of the fuckin ' pub at me , right ?
he' s throwing ' em out of the fuckin ' pub at me .
crunch !
crunch !
i hit this geezer so fuckin ' hard , his legs went like a fuckin ' baby giraffe .
state of that .
i done me knuckles .
so hit people in the mouth , not the back of the fuckin ' head .
just as well i did or you' d be in hospital , you cunt .
no one loved chelsea more than me and rod .
we grew up on football terraces together with my old man .
he knew the score .
you know what to do if someone tries to clump you ?
kick him in the fuckin ' bollocks .
me and rod did everything together .
hurry up , tom , i' m starving .
it took me an hour just to find it .
still rod didn' t need to know that .
she ain' t walkin ' for a week .
my grandad old bill farrell , drove us to drink with his stories about the war and how he fought to put the great into britain .
he said fighting at football was nothing compared to the germans .
we' il fight them on the beaches , we' il fight them on the ...
although he went on , he was right .
we' re an island race .
it' s what we do best .
it' s not about colour or race , it' s just the buzz of being in the front line .
truth is , i just love to fight .
there' s nothing wrong with me ... unlike billy bright , whose dad had a funny way of setting a good example for his son .
right , that' s it .
i' il fight every one of you before you move on next door to us .
come on , son !
with parents like that , he was never gonna end up in greenpeace .
still he was one of the first football thugs to see there was a fortune to be made from england' s love for ecstasy .
oi , three bottles of bud , please , mate .
problem was he' d taken so many beatings on the terraces that he weren' t scared of anyone .
and the correct medical term for that is a " total fuckin ' psycho " .
bill , let' s get out of here .
there' s about ten stoke fans staring at us .
how many of ' em did you say there was ?
about ten .
please don' t start , bill .
right , which one of them' s staring at me .
the big geezer with the hackett cap on .
see you , you cunt .
i' il cut you first .
and that was his idea of a good day out .
you fuckin ' mugs !
but underneath the fun and games and range rovers , biliy was bitter , cos he hever got to run our firm .
harris was top boy and that was that .
he was smarter than billy and ran things like an army unit .
deep down billy knew he' d never be leader and because of that he hated zeberdee .
why ?
simple ...
zeberdee looked up to harris and not him .
and the more zeberdee looked up to harris , the more billy bullied him .
and what chance did zeberdee have as a kid , brought up in a concrete jungle on glue and hate ?
i don' t envy the young ' uns any more .
it' s a nightmare .
warfare from the playground upwards and you know what you have to do to survive in combat .
aargh !
just like me and rod , him and raff are best mates , only difference being they' re thieving little cunts .
in case you' re wondering , we call him zeberdee cos he loves sniffin ' powder .
and one dayn it' il be his downfall .
hold your hand out , raff .
what ?
hold your hand out .
you' re just a fuckin ' kid , ain' t you ?
hold your hand out , bill .
do what ?
hold it out like raff and we' il see how old you are .
oooh .
no , let' s have it right .
you trying to mug me off ?
oh , shut up .
i' m only fuckin ' about an ' that .
what d' you mean , " fuckin ' about " ?
what ?
what d' you mean , " what " ?
you know , just ...
well , don' t fuckin ' just .
leave it out .
you trying to wind me up ?
ain' t trying to wind anyone up .
i' m fuckin ' serious .
what i want to know is , what makes you think you can come in here and mug me off in front of my pals ?
i ...
i didn' t mean nothing by it , bill .
it was only a bubble , that' s all .
just a bubble ?
what you talking to me in that fuckin ' muggy rhyming slang for ?
i never fuckin ' liked you , you little cunt .
you' re a wrong ' un , just like your old man .
he was a degenerate fuckin ' drunk .
do you know what i' m thinking ?
i' m thinking i should take you outside and open you up .
leave it out , bill .
leave what fuckin ' out ?
what , d' you wanna get involved an ' all , do you ?
don' t be stupid .
i' m just saying , he' s only a kid .
no , let' s have it right , tom .
if he' s old enough to run round givin ' it large , fuckin ' bashing people up with us , he' s old enough to talk for himself .
i' il tell you something , zeberfuckindee ,
i think i should take you outside and teach you a lesson for mugging me off and making me look a cunt in front of my fuckin ' pals .
i ...
i didn' t say nothing .
come on , outside , you little fuckin ' stumblebum .
leave it out , eh ?
stop mutterin ' and stutterin ' and fuckin ' liven yourself up .
i fuckin ' had you there !
fuckin ' hell , zeb , you should have seen your fuckin ' face .
i thought you was gonna burst into tears .
what is it , four , five ... eight lagers , donna , please , babe .
there' il be none of this in australia .
as of next week , strictly the amber nectar .
not to worry , william .
i think i' m more of a cocktail man anyway .
well , i won' t be sitting next to you .
well , that was the idea .
bill , albert , i didn' t see you there .
wanna pint ?
my grandad didn' t like bright .
knew he was a bully .
bill and albert were just kids when they did their national service .
they were one of the first off the landing crafts on june 6th .
bill aways told me the only thing that kept him going was albert' s determination and will to live .
they came home proud war heroes and married their childhood sweethearts .
and buried ' em together as well .
the council moved albert to the flat above bill and they swapped door keys , always vowing to keep an eye on each other .
very funny .
very , very funny !
are you all right ?
yeah , yeah .
now a little one .
now a little one .
that' s it , now let me get the door .
let me get the door .
i' il be right in there .
comfy ?
do you want any help with that ?
bet you' ve seen some changes , eh , you two ?
yeah .
bit different nowadays , though , innit , eh ?
gone .
it' s the pakis coming over in the ' 70s , see .
taking over everything .
spoilt it .
and what you got now , eh ?
what you got now ?
fuckin ' asylum seekers .
bloody tony fuckin ' blair .
he' s gotta be a poof , ain' t he ?
new labour ?
i mean , and this game' s gone .
there was a time i used to be able to clear seven and a half , eight hundred shots a week .
not any more .
nah .
now what you got is your fuckin ' spades up in soho moonlighting !
moonlighting !
fuck' s sake , that' s a joke !
you need a full moon just to see ' em !
this country was built on good people like yourselves .
not enough of you about , that' s what i say .
here , let me give you a hand with that .
swing your old arse round in there , look .
that' s it , lovely .
and i just want to say , it' s been a privilege to drive two gentlemen like you .
and the fare' s on me .
don' t be silly .
you' re letting the wheelchair fool you .
no , i insist .
it' s been an honour .
don' t forget , you watch out for them darkies , eh ?
what a wanker .
let' s go dancing .
although he talked a lot of bollocks , in some ways the cabbie was right .
bill was what put the great into britain .
he was an old war hero .
but he' d moved on .
it was australia for him and albert now .
somewhere they could live out the rest of their days in the sun .
hello , mavis , my little darling .
how are you ?
i shall be sad to see you both gone , bill .
are you packed up yet ?
course we have .
ain' t you gonna say goodbye ?
can' t you do better than that . ?
what are you talking about , bill ?
don' t you know ?
you fucking disgusting old man !
that' s what i loved about bill .
he was still game .
he' d dreamed about .
living abroad for years and how his time had come .
i even give him and albert a little treat for going away .
my grandson gave me a going away present .
a joint of his very best home grown .
you mean drugs ?
yeah , well , you light up old , son .
i' il make do with this .
it' s amazing to think in a couple of weeks we' il be watching the sun go down on the other side of the world .
and it won' t be surrounded by tower blocks .
miles of golden sand and bronze tits .
you packed yet ?
haven' t given it a thought .
my case has been packed and sitting inside the front door for three days .
you want to get your skates on , farrell .
oh , stop nagging , you old woman .
you know what bert ?
what' s that ?
i' m feeling dizzy .
you always were , you dozy bastard !
the next best thing to violence is sex , and seeing as there' s nearly 500, 000 single women in london ,
i must be in with half a chance .
especially as i' d fuck anything that' s breathing .
i tell you , i' m fuckin ' mullered , me .
i am fuckin ' mullered .
look at the fuckin ' boat on it .
imagine that round your fuckin ' helmet .
no , no , no , tom .
proper fuckin ' slosh pots .

i' m gonna smash the fuckin ' granny out of that .
london' s changed for the worse .
all the good people , right , all the good people ... are being forced into the suburbs , due to the influx of illegal immigrants forcing their way into this country .
i mean ...
hey , mate .
mate , will you shut your fuckin ' noise ?
here you are , sloppy bollocks .

you fuckin ' little mug !
how dare you come into my fuckin ' gaff , and try and get hold of my little sister against her will ?
you' re in bandit country now , boy , no one will even know you were fuckin ' here .
there' s holes dug all over south london for people like you .
jesus .
i was expecting cornflakes and a quick wank .
but instead , i get some nutter in a stone island jumper and a blade in my face .
and worst of all , that was where all the trouble started .
oi , silly bollocks .
what are these ?
what ?
what are they ?
flowers .
what sort of flowers , dinlow ?
lilies .
then what are they doing with the chrysanths ?
all right .
sorry .
what ?
er ... there' s someone here to see you , bill .
who ? ... the back door .
left her watching blind date .
marched on up to the venus and bumped into sonny .
he' s given me a couple of es .
i' ve had them with a bit more thingy , and wound up copping for two slosh pots out of chigwell .
smashed the granny out of the pair of ' em in the tower hotel till eleven , sunday morning .
yeah , i was back home in time for a sunday roast , but i was completely fuckin ' anninilated .
look , i' ve got to go , mate .
my man' s here .
ta da .
good to see you , son .
how are you ?
all right ?
not bad .
heard you chelsea boys had a little turnout at tottenham at the weekend .
you ain' t wrong .
heard you millwall boys had a little turnout down in pompey .
we did .
we should have had a meet .
would have been fun .
you know where to find us .
any time you like .
your time' il come .
what have you got for me ?
one thing i never understood about bright was , although he was in the chelsea firm , he did business with the head of their rivals .
millwall .
get that .
two men that work together , then kick fuck out of each other if ever they get the chance .
it' s bang on .
what you got round you ?
four k.
go on , then .
i' il take the lot .
cash .
hang on .
hang on .
slow down .
what ?
you' re fuckin ' joking !
all right .
i' il go straight up the hospital .
yeah ' see you there .
problem , fred ?
it' s my brother , terry .
someone' s just done him round the canister with a cricket bat .
you' re fuckin ' joking ?
is he all right ?
they don' t know yet .
look , i gotta go .
i' il keep this lot on ice for you .
i' il call you later .
oi !
what are you fuckin ' doing ?
you' re three hours late .
don' t start , mate .
i' ve had a bit of ag .
what you got a sheet on for ?
you don' t wanna know .

what am i fuckin' paying for ?
just get on with it
what do you reckon , fat boy ?
you look like a vicar , mate .
are you fuckin ' mad ?
this is prada , you cunt .
it' s iron' s gear .
get your fuckin ' skates on .
we gotta get there for the draw .
horrible cunt .
what about the draw ?
how are we gonna find a telly to watch it ?
oh , there' il be tellies where we' re going .
oi , zeb , try and make sure we' ve got a decent house to rob this time , will you ?
i don' t want to watch some piece of shit .
slow down , will you , davis , eh ?
what' s the matter with you ?
are you a fuckin ' hoover ?
whether we were thieving , fucking or fighting tonight , we' d a be glued to a tv set to see who chelsea drew in the cup .
see , the beauty of the cup draw is , it' s a lucky dip , a chance to meet one of the old rivals , like cardiff or west ham , or if you' re really lucky , millwall .
and cos the draw meant so much to billy , he decided to take his long suffering wife barbara out for a quiet , romantic meal .
however , they got their wires crossed , cos barbara thought he was taking her up the west end for some tapas .
let' s see what' s on the menu .
oi , it' s my sister !
oh , what , your girfriend ?
oi .
either turn that tv up , or tell that lot down there to hold their noise down .
calm down , bill .
we don' t want to cause a scene .
no .
no , you' re right .
the old rubber glove !
the old rubber glove , mate .
oi !
oi .
will you shut up ?
i' m trying to watch the fuckin ' telly !
... against 52 .
southend united .
57 .
portsmouth .
will pay number 38 .
middlesbrough .
number 22 .
millwall .
will pay 44 .
chelsea .
yes !
fuckin ' yes !
another battle then .
eh ?
can' t fuckin ' hear you .
who is it , for fuck' s sake ?
eh ?
yes !
who , who , who ?
it' s fuckin ' millwall !
millwall chelsea .
old enemies that always ends up in murders .
literally in my case , cos like a mug i thought i' d get lucky in the same bar again .
and i see my new mate again who , of course , turns out to be millwall .
maybe i should ask him if i fucked his sister , seeing as i can' t remember .
if i' d listened to my instincts and laid low , none of this mess would have happened but i didn' t , and i only had myself to blame .
and occasionally , and i do mean occasionally , it would be nice to have bright out with us .
it' s typicla that tonight he' s taken his wife out for a quiet one .
see ?
he does have a gentle side .
aaaarghh !
zeb and raff missed the draw cos they were doing what they do best robbing houses , something they' d later come to regret .
me , i' m beginning to get the feeling old magic johnson' s lost his touch .
drive , mate !
fuckin ' drive .
i' m being chased !
lost his touch ?
bollocks .
hard to have a nice night out in london , eh ?
i blame all the black s and fun pubs , myself .
shut up mate .
you' re boring .
welcome back to bbc london sport with me , danny kelly .
now , anyone who' s listened to the breakfast show will have heard danny baker going on about his great excitement about the prospects of millwall and chelsea here in london .
our reporter , as always , is pete stevens .
that' s right , danny .
i' m sure there' s going to be a vast police presence to keep the we known hooligan elements apart from these two teams .
i only hope i' m not given the job of reporting live from south london .
i' d much rather be watching the game from the comfort of my front room .
well , come on , albert , you old bastard !
we' il miss our flight .
all right , bill ?
you look pissed off .
no , i' m not fuckin ' all right .
some cunt burgled my house last night .
hold that .
suddenly , going to millwall weren' t so appealing , now i knew my enemies were part of their firm
it' s the one fuckin ' place on earth i didn' t want to be caught out< . / i>
anyway , liverpool away , and a chance to have a good sleep on the coach .
good , this .
what did they nick , bill ?

billy had a real punishmeht lined up for zeberdee .
he weren' t the forgiving type , but as long as harris was around , he couldn' t touch him .
and harris and billy certainy didn' t need another reason to fall out .
right .
no thieving .
no bringing attention to yourselves .
just keep your nuts down .
i want you to be outside and back on the road in five minutes .
oh , yeah , and whatever you do , no fighting .

zeb , what did billy say to you ?
he said we' ve got to get his gear back to him by tomorrow .
and we' ve got to apologise to his wife and kids .
you' ve had a result there .
you' re lucky .
he could have battered you .
blinding result , eh ?
this complete nutter will never talk to us again , and everyone think s we' re thieving little cunts .
you are thieving little cunts .
but you know what you' ve got to do , don' t you ?

you' re 40 years old , and still you offend persistently .
i see children with more common sense .
what did you say ?
don' t you dare answer me with that insolent tongue of yours , you fat fucking slob !
the establishment call us chidren while they' re at king' s cross having sex with ' em .
i should tell this old queer to join us down at millwall .
he might enjoy swapping that silly wig for having a row .
yes , sir .
i' m very sorry , sir .
it won' t happen again , sir .
you can be sure of that .
i do hope that' s the case , mr bright .
i' m passing this over for reports .
i' il see you in a month for sentence .
and bright yes , sir ?
if you appear before me again before that date ,
i won' t hesitate to give you a custodial sentence of a least five years ...
why is it , while i' m having hightmares about dead kids ,
rod' s slipping into the court clerk ?
what' s he got i' m missing ?

he' s hung like a pike in here .
and it' s tricky cos he' s been known to get serious .
how are the tulips selling ?
they flew out at the market .
what' s happening , tom ?

i got nicked with bright the other day , kicking off with the ob .
you' d have loved it .

i only wanted a bunch of fuckin ' flowers , and he tells me to think about my life .
see you , albert .
what' s harris and bright doing there ?
i could hardly stop them , bill .
they' re foolish men , tom .
harris think s we' re connected cos i fought in the war .
what he doesn' t understand is , i fought to stop people like him with their fascist opinions .
billy is a fuckin ' idiot .
are you still going to australia ?
i don' t know .
there' s a spare ticket going begging , if you' re interested .
your cousins would love to see you .
do yourself a favour .
put a bit of distance between you and all that stuff you' re mixed up in .
i' m all right , bill .
i' m just having a laugh .
well , just be careful .
next time you visit the boneyard , it could be in a box .
what are you fuckin ' doing here , you little cunt ?
i' ve cme to pay my respects .
well , you' re not wanted .
let' s have it right .
you didn' t even fuckin ' know him , did you ?

with millwall round the corner , it was time for the juniors to play
nice to see billy and fred could put their differences aside when it come to their kids .
bit of a coincidence , eh ?
our kids play against each other just before we meet in the cup .
somehow , i don' t think this game' s gonna get quite as messy .
do you ?
fancy yourselves in bandit country , then ?
well , let' s have it right .
if history' s anything to go by ,
last time we met you lot , we ran you all over london .

now , what' s your problem ?
that you have to open your kebab shop soon or that you buy charlie off a white man ?
well , how does it feel doing business with a turk , when you' re supposed to be right wing ?
scooby do' s less confused than you .
you' il be confused when i open your canister up .
you wanna wait till the game or make one now ?

i' il fuckin ' do you !
just as i thought .
rod' s been plating the court clerk' s gary , and now she wants to meet his mates .
i told him i already met her in the dock , but he insisted on a social one .
and why is it that when your best mate meets a girl , he quickly changes into a fuckin ' melt , 703 00 : 45 : 51, 840 > 00 : 45 : 54, 912 and acts like he' s only known you for ten minutes ?
so ... what do you do , then , thomas ?

my grandad' s life was disappearing in front of his eyes .
with albert dead , he had no one , apart from me , so it was time to give him some family support , and maybe even some friendly advice .
you should come to millwall at the weekend .
that' il liven you up a bit .
you all right for money , bill ?
cos you know you' ve only got to ask .
i' m earning a few quid down the market now .
it ain' t as if i got a bird to spend it on .
unlike rod .

yeah , well ...
your chance' il come .

i' il ...
i' il fling myself on my knees and let him kick the fuck out of me .

three weeks ago , i was getting on with my life .
but now , with millwall round the corner , i' m half the man i was , which ain' t saying much .
and the worst is yet to come .
here' s mark with the sport .
well , the third round takes place this saturday , and of course the pick of the ties has got to be chelsea against millwall .
i know police leave is cancelled , but this goes beyond that .
this is that ancient rivalry ...
hello , bill .
donna , give him a pint , love .
put ' em on the tab .
how' s your luck ?
not bad , billy .
how are you ?

same as before .
i' il take some of you lot down through south bermondsey , and tommy will take the rest from surrey quays .
where' s the meet ?
it can' t be too far away .
they' il have spotters out all over the place .
and it' s on top of the old bill before we start .
what about billy ?
what about billy ?
he knows millwall like the back of his hand .
fuck billy .
he don' t know what he' s doing any more .
now , let' s have it right .
we all know he' s become a liability .
granted , yeah he can have a row .
but he can' t run a turnout down in south london .
he' s a fuckin ' lunatic .
look what happened in liverpool .
bollocksed the day up .
his problem is , he' s taken too much of that shit up his nose .
just forget him .
slow down .
he' s one of your own .
hang on .
you' ve got to make harris right here .
it' s like having a big kid around .
he' s a fuckin ' dope , mate .
just let him take zeberdee and those chavvies .
that' il do him .
you just wipe your mouth of him .
he' s a spent force .
bill ...

bill .

how comes you weren' t down the pub last night ?
fell asleep , didn' t i ?
how comes you know i weren' t there ?
harris belled me and asked where you were .
well , he didn' t fuckin ' bell me .
maybe he forgot , eh ?
got it ?
fuck me !
what' s that for ?
millwall .
don' t be stupid .
you can' t take a gun down there .
it' s only a flare gun .
what are you on about ?
you' il kill someone .
meant to be having a laugh aren' t we ?
fuckin ' hell , bill .
you' re on the turn , ain' t you ?
you ain' t got nothing to prove .
ain' t i ?
you look as handsome as you did on our wedding day .
where are your medals ?
you can' t go to whitehall without them , dear .
you' re a hero william .

i tell you , it' s a fuckin ' buzz !
come on !
here , tom , where' s rod ?
fuck knows .
you all right ?
yeah .
couldn' t sleep , could i ?
fuckin ' buzzing .
the wretch from penge had got her claws in , and only a miracle could bring him back .
but i couldn' t see it happening .
i' d lost him when i needed him most .
and not even someone of rod' s calibre woud have the bottle to say ...
that espresso' s really kicked in .
darling you don' t drink espresso .
tell me more about the air conditioning , rodney .
i' m fascinated .
air conditioning ?
you told me you run an air conditioning firm .
well , we have a few vans out on jobs at once most of the time .
well , it' s always busier in the summer .
nothing like a soaring temperature to help the work .
anyway , most of the time i just sit around the office , waiting for the weekend .
don' t get me wrong .
i love the money the job pays .
but my real passion lies in kicking people' s fucking heads in at football .
see , i' ve got to channel it somewhere , and as you can tell by my bulging stomach ,
i don' t participate in too many sporting activities .
and i don' t do drugs .
well , that' s not entirely true , but not a lot .
so , i need my release , and a good fuckin ' fight seems the best way .
wouldn' t you agree ?
maybe no . t
at least i wouldn' t be walking around like you fuckin ' horrible cunts with stick s up your arses , trying to pretend your little suburban nightmare' s all right .
then again , it just depe, ds which way you look at it .
mate , can we have the ...
no , i' il ...
rod !
i fuckin ' knew you' d make it !
wouldn' t miss it for the world , mate .
there' s a fuckin ' shot , man .

well , let' s see how game you really are .
so , come and find us , then , shithead .
oh , and be careful .

away from all the crowds and the ready eye .
so , watch your fuckin ' backs .

thank fuck for that .
what about australia , bill ?

what about you ?
what about me ?
huh !
was it worth it ?
kicked half to death , florists , cabbies , nightmares and visions .
one of the old soldiers gone for ever .
bright gone for a seven , and bollocks so ruptured that the only thing i' il be pulling for months is a chain .
after all that you really do have to ask yourself if it was a worth it .
course it fuckin ' was .
yeah , just get a pint over here .
they reckon , as soon as he got sentenced , he started crying his eyes out .
i' il do it standing on my head , you mug .
