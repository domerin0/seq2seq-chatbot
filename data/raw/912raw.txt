yeah , you could be the carrot .
let him try your carrot on .
no .
you' il be the broccoli .
i don' t want to be a bush .
it' s not a bush , it' s a stalk .
a strong stalk of broccoli .
i' m pretty strong .
you can make that work .
let' s switch this suit and get the broccoli .

it' s princeton for preschoolers .
let' s hurry up so we won' t be late for the orientation .
what' s the orientation about ?
it' s a preschool , they' il be playing with blocks , right ?
unbelievable .
language skills are a critical component here at chapman .
they' re part of our core curriculum .
you must be charles .

nice to meet you .
how do you do ?
this is my wife , kim .
hi .
kimberly .
i' m miss harridan , the headmistress .
and this is ben .
how do you do , benjamin ?
come on , little man .
it' s a pleasure to meet you .
shall we begin ?
look at their outfits .
i like that .
they' re cute .
we find uniforms reinforce the sense of structure .
structure' s good .
our philosophy is that a child is like a climbing vine .
with structure to cling to , and the right gardener to tend them ... they' il grow to the sky .
sorry .
so , mrs. hinton ... you' re returning to work ?
lawyer , i believe your file said .
actually , i haven' t practiced yet .
we just had ben when i finished law school .
still a little nervous about leaving him .
all mothers are .
but you needn' t worry .
our little seedlings are in very good hands .
turn the darn phone off .
it' s off .
and attack !
now mark your books , number five .
cat is to mouse as frog is to ...
are they doing sat prep ?
it' s never too early to start .
nest .
that' s right .
nest .
i thought you turned your phone off .
it' s not my phone , it' s my two way .
this is bad .
go ahead .
okay .
thank you , baby .
i am terribly sorry .
i have an emergency at work .
i gotta go .
i understand .
i' m sorry .
hey , little man .
daddy' s got to get going , but i' il see you later on , okay ?
you want to do the rocket ship ?
let' s do the rocket ship .
sorry about all the noise .
here you go .
go to mommy .
i' il see you later .
thank you for your time .
i' m so sorry .
he' s trying out a new product at work .
no need to apologize .
diligence always sets a fine example .
jenny .
just in time .
here' s a copy of our curriculum ... and a list of your financial obligations .
this is the price per year ?
per month .
ben is starting preschool today .
where at ?
over at that chapman academy .
the marine corps of day care .
max goes there .
really ?
what do you think of that place ?
there isn' t much choice .
you got harridan and her merry fembots ... or idiot von idiot and their school for children who like accidents .
numbers just came in for chocolatey chocolate balls .
through the roof !
that' s a surprise .
you hear that ?
kids like chocolate .
ice cream , too .
i forgot i was talking to the granola heads from the natural food division .
what was the stinker you got saddled with ?
it' s not a stinker .
it' s veggie os , the cereal of the future .
right , veggie blows .
i thought they were killing that .
jerry !
the numbers on the chocolatey chocolate balls are through the roof !
what does he mean , " killing that " ?
why you listening to bruce ?
nothing' s being killed .
he' s a clown .
if something was going down , we' d know .
we' re killing it .
come on , jim .
we had one bad test .
it' s a hard nut to crack .
any fool can sell chocolatey chocolate balls ... and cotton candy flavored cereal to kids .
cotton candy .
that' s not bad .
guys , look .
i' m sorry , but it was a dog .
kids just don' t want to eat vegetables for breakfast .
who knew ?
i told you that six months ago when you put us on this project .
you did ?
it' s not just veggie os .
we' re shutting down the whole health division .
that' s like 300 people .
it' s not a business we want to be in .
where are we being reassigned ?
pooch , how was your first day at school ?
okay .
just okay ?
i don' t know anybody there .
give it some time .
you' il make some friends .
how was your day , baby ?
i lost my j o b.
you lost your j o b ?
i got f l r e d.
me and 300 other people .
they cannot do that !
can' t jim fields do something ?
he' s the one that pulled the trigger .
he' s not gonna do anything .
when i found out it was him , i told him to take a flying ...
charlie !
h l j k l m n o p.
don' t worry about this .
i' m in demand , and i' il have a new job in a week .
what if we use the emergency fund ?
we can' t .
we already used it on the car payment .
there' s no way around it .
we gotta pull ben out of chapman .
it' s too much money .
what will we do for child care ?
are you gonna stay home with him ?
no , i' m not gonna stay home with him .
we just gotta find something more affordable , that' s all .
this is the right address .
you gotta be kidding me .
we can at least check it out .
ben is not going here .
looks can be deceiving .
i' il go look .
looks can be deceiving ?
we' re in a trailer park !
i' m looking for the preschool .
yes , it is .
welcome to the ...
sorry .
welcome to the touch of eden preschool .
can i help you ?
no , thank you .
is this the right address , here ?
i think so .
we keep the children right around here .
go ahead .
after you , ma' am .
okay .
where' d you get this address ?
you picked this place .
we should report this to somebody .
that' s what i' m talking about .
i knew there had to be at least one decent place .
it looks all right .
this is the police .
we have you surrounded .
all right , charlie .
give up the keys .
i don' t know where the keys are .
don' t even try it .
why don' t you drive the minivan ?
no .
we talked about this last night .
you' re staying home with ben .
i' m driving the mercedes .
you have me driving around town in the dumb minivan all day .
is the top down ?
you know what , kim ?
be careful .
don' t just park it anyplace .
be careful getting in and out of the car .
don' t get any dings in the door .
come here .
make sure you put good gas in there .
if you put in the cheap stuff ... the engine will start knocking , and i don' t want that .
you don' t leave milk in the car with the windows rolled up .
always buckle up the car seat .
don' t park in the sun or the seats will get too hot .
and no juice unless it' s in a sippy cup .
bye , baby .
can you give a call , tell us what time you' il be back ?
because we' il be here waiting , just the two of us .
bye , mom .
not too fast !
see you later .
when' s mommy coming back ?
she' il be back around dinnertime , mommy .
is dinnertime soon ?
no , but don' t you worry .
we' re going to have a lot of fun .
but we need mommy to have fun .
are you trying to just break me down in the driveway ?
why you want to break your father down ?
i' m sorry .
that' s better .
you broke me down smooth .
my eyes welled up .
i' m sorry .
you made my eyes well up .
okay , let' s ...
look at my eyes .
i see your eye twitching .
we' re going to have fun !
do you know how to change a diaper ?
yes , but i thought max was potty trained .
believe me , so did i.
don' t do that to me !
what are you ...
he' s throwing things at me , and it smells .
i really need your help !
are you potty trained ?
yes .
you got to go stinky ?
yes .
then , go on .
go stinky , then .
you have a nauseous ache in your stomach that you' re a worthless failure ?
we are worthless failures .
hey , guys .
hey , peggy .
how you doing ?
good .
what' s going on , nicky ?
he can be a little hard to understand sometimes .
honey , go play .
have a good time , have fun .
stay away from that cat poop .
" hija " ?
what' d he just say ?
god , i haven' t a clue .
the doctor says it' s just a phase , but ...
it kept him out of chapman .
jerks .
put that mouse down !
give it to me !
what are you ...
charlie , i think it' s great , you guys being full time dads .
we' re real giants among men .
you are .
you should be proud .
most guys don' t know who their kids are .
joe still hasn' t found anything ?
no , and he' s driving me crazy .
i should go back to work , but what about nicky ?
dead mouse .
there' s no good alternative to chapman .
if someone opened a decent day care program here , they' d make a killing .
nicky , what did i say about the cat poop ?
what ?
a day care center ?
you and me ?
it' s a completely underserved market .
harridan has a monopoly on this suburb .
all we have to do is come in ... establish ourselves as the value alternative , and we' il clean up !
you think i' d be good at child care ?
absolutely .
excuse me ?
are these your kids ?
no .
remember when you broke my yo yo ?
i did not break your yo yo .
yes , you did .
i did not break your yo yo .
your yo yo was broke .
you' re killing me .
you' re really killing me .
i' m home !
you said let' s do this together .
no , daddy !
what' s going on here ?
a day care center .
in our house ?
yes , phil' s apartment' s only a two bedroom place .
this is crazy on 10 different levels .
what do you both know about running a day care ?
it' s not rocket science .
we applied for a license .
it couldn' t be any more simple .
daddy .
what you want ?
the rocket ship ?
that' s what you wanted , right ?
milk .
you wanted milk ?
i' m sorry .
he wanted milk .
rocket man needs milk when he' s flying .
it' s for strong bones , in case you crash .
we understand each other .
what you think about this ?
we' re talking about other people' s kids .
do you understand that responsibility ?
i' il be just as careful with them as i am with ben .
don' t be rubbing your head into stuff .
watch where you' re walking .
what about when you get a real job ?
just leave the parents hanging ?
we' il cross that bridge when we get to it .
it won' t be permanent .
we won' t get rich from this , but it might keep us out of bankruptcy .
i don' t know , charlie .
come on , kim .
i can' t just sit around here .
i got to try to do something .
come on .
i need this .
i guess you better start handing out those fliers .
all right .
it makes much more sense ...
me , too .
okay , you want me to give you a hug ?
here' s a big hug .
group hug .
excuse me .
when you get a chance ...
here you go , daddy day care .
hey , little karate guy .
daddy day care , karate girl .
hello !
daddy day care .
hello , how are you ?
here you go .

when you get a chance , have a look at that .
thank you .
if it' s not too much trouble , when you get a chance ...
warm , nurturing , experienced parents ...
providing exceptional child care at affordable prices .
the " experienced " part is what i have to take issue with .
i give it three days .
you two guys are running a day care center ?
you' re signing up people at a lemonade stand on the front lawn ?
good luck with that .
come on , paul .
wait .
don' t you believe in equality amongst the sexes ?
can' t men do everything women can do ?
no , we can' t .
it' s unnatural .
little bit eeky .
you' re guys ?
what did you think daddy day care meant ?
i thought maybe one guy .
not only guys .
i just thought it was a clever name .
is this the day care place ?
they' re all guys .
they' re what ?
excuse me .
listen .
we are two loving , caring parents .
we run a day care center .
you' re a couple of sickos !
how about a free trial offer ?
sickos !
oh , dear .
come on !
hi , peggy !
hi , nicky .
how you doing ?
nicky is so excited for his big day .
how old are you ?
oh , yeah , five .
i got it .
wait .
you' re leaving nicky here with these guys ?
you have trouble with them being guys ?
are you from the dark ages ?
aren' t you for gender equality and all that jazz ?
peggy , come on .
of course we are .
so can' t women do what men do and men do what women do ?
these guys can do the job .
you' il vouch for these two ?
yeah , i' il vouch for them .
i' il try it .
you' re doing it ?
they' il have a great time .
okay .
right , kids ?
you' re a real lifesaver .
you screw this up , i' il kill you with my bare hands .
here , now , go to phil .
no , i don' t want to go .
come on .

or maltodextrose .
nothing with red dye number six .
or number four .
or yellow dye number two .
will you say " maltodextrose " for me again ?
so cute .
maltodextrose .
or yellow dye number two .

four absent children .

you caught us at a crazy time .
we' re playing with the kids .
somebody complained about us ?
so , where is the nap area ?
the nap area ?
right .
we don' t have a nap area .
we just let them fall asleep wherever they drop .
sleep where they drop .
well , i think that should just about do it .
what' s the bottom line ?
well , you need to correct the deficiencies on this form .
and also ... you need to fill out these compliance certification documents .
who wants these , the carrot or the broccoli ?
carrot .
there' s a lot of stuff on here .
so we can stay open , right ?
as long you' ve done that by 9 : 00 a . m .
tomorrow morning .
9 : 00 a . m .
good luck with this .
i like what you' re doing .
i' d hate to be the guy to shut you down .
we' d hate for you to be that guy .
i will be .
don' t want to be .
okay .
safety gates at the bottom of the stairs ... top of the stairs , bedrooms , bathrooms .
i' ve gone safety gate crazy .
how many kids have we got ?
i' ve lost track , they run so fast .
you can get started on this batch over here .
it' s getting late .
let' s just call it a night .
we can' t call it a night .
we got a bunch of kids coming in five hours .
i' m serious .
we know nothing about running a day care center .
we don' t know anything .
we' re not even good parents !
i' m a good parent .
what does that mean ?
what ?
that thing .
what is that ?
you know that rocket ship thing you do ?
ben doesn' t even like that .
that just happens to be ben' s favorite thing .
he lets you do it because you like it .
it' s the one time you pay him attention .
you don' t change your kid' s diapers .
i don' t like diapers .
you should teach your kid how to go to the toilet and aim ... so we don' t have to redecorate the place when he goes .
you' re right .
let me tell you something .
my kid is 4 years old , and for the first time today ...
i saw him playing with the other kids , just being a normal kid .
it felt great knowing i had something to do with it .
we did that !
if we can do that , we can definitely get this place up to code by dawn .
let' s go safety gate crazy .
don' t worry , he' il be fine .
it' s all right .
all i got is $5 .
i can break that .
listen , i left the paperwork on the kitchen table .
it' s not there .
please tell me you have it .
i don' t have it .
hey , guys .
marvin , what are you doing here ?
the door was unlocked .
i got your final paychecks here .
thanks .
so , what' s going on here ?
don' t even ask .
you can understand him ?
yeah , he' s speaking klingon .
that' s klingon .
i thought the kid was an idiot .
god , how much " star trek " does that kid watch ?
too much .
the guy from child services is here .
sorry .
no , listen .
why don' t you do me a favor ?
why don' t you take the kids in the back and play with them ?
keep their attention for a while , while i talk to this guy .
whatever you do , don' t let this big bruiser get near the lawnmower .
thanks .
mr. kubitz .
hi .
i thought i was early , but ...
i was just getting the paperwork .
great .
you dropped something .
yeah .
the kids wanted to help out .
that' s sweet .
so here' s everything for you .
what i' il need is your signature on the back of her head .
and on the elbow of this kid .
do you have a pen ?
i do have a pen .
this is my lucky pen .
thank you .
and where' s on the ...
initial the elbow .
sign the back of her head .
on her neck ?
great .
that should just about do it .
here we go .
you' re ready to roll .
let' s go in and get started .
well , you know , everything looks okay here ... but it says here that you now have 11 children .
that' s correct .
so i assume that you' ve hired a third care provider .
why would you just assume that ?
well , section 768 of the child welfare code specifically states ... that the ratio of children to care providers cannot exceed 5 : 1 .
the 768 . 04 .
768 . 04 .
the ratio thingy .
we resolved that this morning .
good .
yes .
we hired someone .
we hired marvin .
marvin was hired !
he' s with the kids .
he' s an excellent child care worker .
i' d love to take a look , if that' s okay with you .
you want to go out there ?
it' il be good for me to see for myself .
let' s go and have a look at marvin .
now , put your hands up .
now , wave them .
he certainly seems like he knows what he' s doing .
of course .
i' ve got to say that .
yeah , we interviewed a lot of people .
yeah , it was a really long , grueling singling out process .
and now , i' m a chicken .
i' m a bird .
look , i' m a bird .
you can never be too careful when it comes to kids .
and here at daddy day care we' il only work with the best , so we got marvin .
sorry .
what did you do to these kids ?
what ?
are they on drugs ?
well , there' s this one kid , maybe .
how' d you get them to behave like this ?
got to know how to handle them .
how do you know that ?
i read " dr. spock' s baby and child care " book .
it' s not about " star trek " .
finish .
yeah .
you know , when i was in the back ...
i spotted , under the eaves of the porch ... what looked like a beehive .
a big one .
don' t worry .
all taken care of .
i don' t want anybody getting hurt .
no hurt .
gone .
you really have turned this around .
thank you very much .
i' m impressed .
i really am .
thank you .
for our own curiosity ... any chance you could tell us where the complaint came from ?
i really would love to , but i have a relationship with the state .
just for our own curiosity .
that was miss harridan .
i' m sure she' il see us .
we need to talk to you .
sorry .
they just barged right in .
that' s quite all right , jenny .
gentlemen , please sit down .
now , what can i do for you ?
we wanted to thank you for helping to expedite our accreditation process .
thanks to your tip , somebody from child services came to see us .
i had heard you opened some sort of day care program ... and i was concerned .
that' s nice of you .
you don' t have to be concerned about us .
it' s not you i' m concerned about .
it' s the children you' re looking after .
wait a minute .
we' re parents .
that' s a start .
any boob can be a parent .
if you want to screw up your own child , that' s your right .
but when it comes to other people' s kids , there' s a higher standard to answer to .
mr. kubitz seems to think that we met that standard .
show her the thing .
that piece of paper doesn' t impress me .
we' re getting it laminated .
you two are just some fly by night operation looking to make a fast buck .
you' re just afraid of the competition .
let' s go .
competition ?
don' t flatter yourselves .
daddy day care will never be in the same league as this institution .
laminated !
that wasn' t as satisfying as i thought .
i think we can take her .
all we need is some garlic and a wooden stake .
you know what she said that was right ?
these kids need more than watching .
tomorrow we' il take it up a notch .
we got to start stimulating their minds .
but i' m not a daddy .
you don' t have to be a daddy .
you' re a male type humanoid .
that fits in with the philosophy of the place .
i don' t know , guys .
i mean , i guess i like hanging out with the kids .
it' s kind of cool .
but i guess child care wasn' t necessarily ... an avenue that i felt professionally i was headed towards .
that' s exactly what i said .
excuse me .
yes , come on in !
how are you ?
hey , guys .
i am so sorry .
i forgot to write you a check this week .
ever since the divorce , my head' s just been like ...
are you the new daddy ?
i' m your daddy .
i' m not your daddy .
well , i' m your baby' s daddy .
i' m not ...
i' m not your baby' s daddy .
i' m going to be ...
you' re marvin .
well , it' s nice to meet you , marvin .
i' m kelli .
dylan' s mom .
i got to run .
thank you .
all right .
bye , guys .
have a good one .
thanks .
bye .
i' m in .
do you have a dental plan ?
all right .
your first assignment is to show us how you handle kids the way you do .
teach us .
if this were a business , and they were customers ... how do you find out what they want ?
i' d put together a focus group .
all right , let' s do it .
we' d like you to tell us what you' d like to get out of daddy day care .
we' d like you to tell us what you' d like to get out of daddy day care .
help us to help you .
who' d like to start ?
we need more learning about things .
more learning about things ?
yes .
we' re at a very critical age .
you have to feed our minds .
all right .
you want to write that down ?
feed our minds .
great .
okay , what else ?
dolphins .
dolphins are good .
dolphins are fish .
no , they' re not .
they live in water .
that doesn' t mean they' re fish .
calm down and talk about something else .
what else would you like to talk about ?
where do babies come from ?
let' s go back to the dolphin subject and discuss dolphins ... or if there' s anything else on someone' s mind we can talk about ...
other than that .
write that down .
okay , what else ?
could we ...
what were you going to say , ben ?
i can see you were going to say something .
what is it , son ?
more ... drawing ?
more drawings ?
yeah !
like pictures and stuff .
it' s really fun .
okay , yeah , great .
more drawings .
yeah !
more chasing bad guys .
excellent idea .
we can chase joker .
well , wait a second , buddy .
that' s batman' s bad guy .
you' re flash , so you want to be chasing ...
lex luthor ?
no .
that' s superman .
you want to be chasing captain boomerang , gorilla grodd , reverse flash .
the riddler ?
what have you been doing to these kids ?
starting tomorrow , phil will be hosting a three stooges film festival in the tv room .
i know everybody' s looking forward to that , right ?
thanks , daddy !
last but not least , the thumb suckers support group will have a meeting ... under the tree after nap time ... which starts right after you finish your snack .
so after you finish , grab a blanket , get a spot , and we have that .
also , next week is going to be alpha girls group .
and we' re going to have tai chi under the tree .
and we' re going to also have pet day , so you bring your pets in .
we' il have pet show and tell .
this is my bunny .
his name is tiny .
i feed him a lot .
five times a day .
he poops a lot , too .
six times a day .
it' s like little marbles .
this is my turtle , sparks .
he' s fast .
he' s the fastest turtle in the world .
go !
go , sparks !
this is my parrot , paulie .
i' m teaching him to talk .
talk .
shut up , butthead .
okay , becca , where' s your pet ?
i had a tarantula , but i don' t know where he is .
okay , all right , don' t panic .
what do you mean , don' t panic ?
there' s a big spider in here .
i got a spider on my head !
so what are we betting on today ?
i' m going to do a diaper stroke , okay ?
all right .
well , if it isn' t the geniuses that brought the world veggie os .
so , how' s unemployment ?
actually , i' ve got the best job i' ve ever had .
yeah , it' s a start up .
we offer time management facilitation to mostly working professionals .
that' s a tough market .
sounds pretty cutthroat .
yeah .
it' s a real blood sport .
what' s the money like ?
bruce !
let' s go , i got botox .
hi , charlie .
hi , phil .
hey , crispin .
what' s up , little man ?
how do you know my kid ?
they' re his day care teachers , what do you think ?
day care ?
that' s what it is ?
oh , my god .
you' re wiping boogers for a living .
losers .
you' re paying us to do it , too , you know .
losers .
do you like green eggs and ham ?
i do not like them , sam l am .
i do not like green eggs and ham .
would you like to eat them here or there ?
i would not like to eat them anywhere .
i do not like green eggs and ham .
i do not like them , sam l am . " okay ?
now see , he was going to punch sam l am , but he walked away .
you don' t punch , see ?
he walked away with it .
where' s mommy ?
mommy had to work today .
remember when you used to work all the times ?
yeah , back when i had a real job .
do you miss work ?
i guess .
i suppose so .
i miss it .
but don' t get me wrong .
it' s not like i don' t like hanging out with you guys .
it' s just that daddy used to be a big shot down at work .
i had my own office and a big , pretty view .
remember that big , pretty view daddy had ?
i like it when you spin me around in that cool chair .
yeah , that' s a cool chair .
a lot of cool things about that job .
cool chair ...
i had people working underneath me ... and , just between you and i , the pay wasn' t that bad either .
put that down .
what do you think of that ?
what is it ?
what do you mean ?
it' s a dog in the sunshine .
it doesn' t look like one .
that' s because it' s abstract .
you have to squint when you look at it .
and when you see it like this , that' s abstract .
yeah ?
you see it ?
how about if you tilt your head to the side ?
no , the other way .
still doesn' t look like one .
okay , well , what are you over there working on , michelangelo ?
what is that ?
there' s nothing abstract about that now , is it ?
thanks .
that' s pretty good .
you got daddy' s head looking kind of round , though .
is my head that round ?
no .
but i got your mustache .
yeah , i see .
a nice green mustache .
that' s all right , son .
i just paid the mortgage , the car loan and the electric bill .
look at the balance in the checking account .
74 cents .
yeah .
that' s right , 74 cents .
you are my superman .
you got that right .
i' ve worked hard , and i think it' s time to let off a little of my frustration .
it' s time for you to take care of your superman .
my superman .
come here , baby .
that' s right .
no !
the monster' s going to get me !
it' s probably a nightmare .
be right back .
okay , hurry up .
mommy' s coming !
no , i want daddy .
did everything go okay ?
yeah , everything' s just fine .
what' s that face for ?
since when does he like you better than he likes me ?
no , don' t even trip .
it' s not like that .
i' ve just been spending more time with him , so he wanted me .
he' s getting much more confident .
remember how he wouldn' t play with anyone else at first ?
now , he' s even playing with that kid , crispin .
crispin happened to say " thank you " at lunch today without being told .
and that little girl becca , she can read .
she' s just a baby .
i seen her pick up a " curious george " book , sit down and read like a grownup .
what' s that face ?
i haven' t seen you this excited about something in a long time .
yeah , i ain' t going to front .
them little crumb snatchers got under my skin .
mrs. plager , i cannot continue to expose the other children ... to such dangerous , self destructive , highly addictive behavior .
so either juliette stops the thumb sucking ... or you' il just have to find yourself another preschool .
are you busy ?
just pruning a few weeds from the garden .
what is it ?
okay , i just thought you should know ... we' ve lost three more students .
are you seriously suggesting you don' t know where they are ?
no , ma' am .
i know where they are .
so do i.
daddy day care .
first , it was amusing .
then it was annoying .
now it' s really starting to tick me off .
get me a copy of " child day care services regulations " .
phil , get the door .
get the door !
all right , i got it .
mr. kubitz .
what are you doing here ?
is this a bad time ?
no , it' s a great time .
is the man of the house at home ?
man of the house .
charlie !
mr. kubitz is here from child services !
i' il be right there .
so , let me ask you .
where are the kids ?
outside .
marvin' s giving them a puppet show .
nice .
what' s on the program ?
pinocchio " ?
little red riding hood " ?
no , " wrath of khan " .
mr. kubitz .
hi !
hi .
wait !
what are you doing ?
what ?
what' s wrong with your face ?
my face ?
what' s all that stuff , man ?
come on .
what' s the matter with you ?
becca and jamie .
if you' il excuse me , i have to see two little girls ... because now i' m a big girl .
he' s having fun with ...
mr. kubitz , so what brings you here today ?
i' ve received another complaint ...
i guess we know who that came from .
i understand that you' ve acquired three more children since my last visit .
yes .
we' re 14 altogether now .
it' s still three adults , so we' re still under the 5 : 1 ratio .
right .
but you see , it' s a totally different issue this time .
charlie , can i talk to you for a second ?
mr. kubitz , excuse me a second .
i' m going to go handle this .
have a cookie .
sure .
thanks .
what' s going on ?
what' s up ?
flash is gone .
what do you mean , gone ?
gone where ?
i can' t find him .
you looked everywhere ?
in the garage ?
everywhere .
what we going to do ?
is there some kind of problem out here ?
not at all , mr. kubitz .
we' re just having a little conversation about the ...
okay , because if it' s ...
no problem at all .
why don' t you ...
kids !
why don' t you meet our good friend , mr. kubitz .
say hi .
hi , mr. kubitz .
hi , guys .
wouldn' t it be nice if mr. kubitz played with you guys ... while we had an important conversation ?
would you be so kind ?
is that a good idea ?
we' re having a grown up conversation the kids shouldn' t be privy to .
so just for a second .
please .
sure .
that' s different .
i' il check the back yard .
i' il go upstairs .
i' il check the basement .
do we have a basement ?
we have to do the laundry .
god !
oh , my god !
they vaporized him !
he couldn' t have got far .
i' il call the police .
i' il call his parents .
lf only i were a betazoid , i could sense him .
which kid is this ?
i don' t know .
what' s your name ?
tony .
flash' s name is tony .
actually , flash' s name is wally west ...
why aren' t you wearing your flash suit ?
i don' t want to be flash anymore .
you don' t ?
who you want to be ?
tony .
hear that ?
he wants to be tony .
he wants to be tony .
that' s nice .
you want to be tony .
that' s great .
tony , have a cookie .
have a fresh one .
what are you talking about ?
i do love you .
i' m just not in love with you .
what are you talking about ?
i do love you .
i' m just not in love with you .
fifteen months of therapy , that' s the best you can do ?
that is the dumbest line i have ever heard .
my mother was right about you .
wait .
for what ?
you think this will change ?
you think i' il change ?
you think this is what i had in mind ?
being a 55 year old man , living with his mother ?
you think that' s my idea of a good time ?
i love passive aggressive losers .
according to state regulations , a child care center in a family home ... is limited to a maximum of 12 children .
we have plenty of room here for these kids .
i don' t make the rules , i enforce them .
you can' t have more than 12 kids at this kind of location .
so if we want to stay in business , we have to fire two kids .
unless you want to move to a permanent facility somewhere else , then yes .
so , who do we cut loose ?
how about becca and jamie ?
i can' t do it .
we got to do something .
why don' t we get a bigger space ?
space .
the final frontier .
i' m serious .
harridan said we' re not real .
let' s get real .
let' s get a bigger space , more kids , hire more people ... and give this woman a run for her money .
great .
let' s get a new space .
yeah , final frontier !
if you don' t stop with that " star trek " , i' il push you in that sticker bush .
stop !
no !
i' m saying that there is a space available called " the final frontier .
this used to be my home away from home .
jerry , the guy who owned this place , had the ultimate collection of memorabilia .
you know what he had ?
tricorder .
that ensign riley wore in " the doomsday machine " .
yeah .
i never saw that episode .
i was with him , not watching also .
needs a lot of work .
that just means we can fix it up how we want to fix it up .
but we' il need some money to do that .
to make money , you got to spend money .
to spend money , you got to have money .
rock for daddy day care .
help us finance our new permanent home .
do you know what this means ?
it' s a chance to improve ourselves through a little healthy competition ?
no , you bubbleheaded idiot .
it' s a death sentence .
if they get their hands on a big enough space , they' il ruin me .
they' re selling fun .
i can' t compete with fun .
i should' ve crushed them in the beginning when they were weak .
it' il be harder now , but i have no choice .
i' ve got to stop them .
how are you gonna do that ?
by any means necessary .
yeah , ride the pony .
pet the goat .
get a t shirt made .
something to eat .
enjoy the music !
they' re showing " logan' s run " , friday ...
friday night at 8 : 00 .
if you' re not busy friday nights ...
maybe you' d like to ...
yeah , sure .
great .
so we' re talking , like , just dinner , bath , bed ?
the works ?
what ?
you want me to baby sit so you can go to the movie , right ?
marvin , i want you to go with me .
okay .
okay .
great .
all right .
here' s your thing .
thank you very much .
okay .
there you go .
i don' t think we should do this .
jennifer , my dear , in life there are winners and there are losers .
and if you want to be a winner , sometimes you have to play dirty .
i' il show you .
i' il paint my face first .
and then you paint yourself .
see ?
put a little paint .
and i' m just going to ...
what' s wrong ?
that' s not paint !
it' s glue !
could i have some more of this delicious potato salad ?
have you tried it ?
really .
it is so good .
what' s up ?
look .
and they got into everything except for the pies .
okay , but don' t panic .
we' il just sell the people pies , that' s all .
wow .
goats really love pie .
leave them on for two hours .
you got it .
everybody just take a deep breath and let' s go back to having fun .
okay ?
how' d we do ?
we haven' t even put a dent in it .
hello ?
charlie , jim fields .
how' s your vacation going ?
no , i' m just pulling your leg .
listen , buddy , are you still looking for work ?
i' ve got a job for you , unless you' ve got other offers .
no , that' s really interesting .
but i' ve got something going on right now .
before you say no , let me fax you over the proposal .
you can take a look at the numbers , you think about it ... then you get back to me .
yeah .
okay .
great .
you say hi to the wife and daughter ...
son .
let me guess .
you couldn' t get child services to come back ... so you' re doing the inspection .
i apologize .
i don' t like to be sneaky .
still , rules are rules .
may i come in ?
i' ve a proposition for you .
yeah , please do .
can i get you some coffee or tea or water ...
or eye of newt , maybe ?
water would be lovely .
thank you .
water .
that' s an easy one .
you don' t mind tap water , do you ?
we' re out of the bottled water .
so , miss harridan , why are you here ?
you seem smart , talented , highly ambitious .
what on earth are you doing running a day care center ?
maybe i enjoy running a day care center .
obviously .
but is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life ?
as a businessman , you' d have money , power , respect .
you going to throw that all away to baby sit a bunch of 3 year olds ?
i said i' d listen to your proposition .
i' m all ears , and i got other things to do .
so if you' d be so kind ...
all right .
if daddy day care should close , for whatever reason ...
i' il take all your children for the price you charge .
topflight education at rock bottom prices .
think about it .
now wait a minute .
you' re blowing us off for cottony cotton balls ?
no , cotton candy puffs .
apparently the whole thing was my idea .
they' il double my salary and let me run the division .
so , yes , i am taking myself back .
go ahead , if that' s what' s important to you .
i mean ...
phil and i can manage .
we' il just find somebody else .
right ?
i' m going , too .
this is worse than when spock betrayed kirk ...
on " star trek v " .
it' s not like that .
come back with us .
not in the mailroom , but to be part of our team .
i don' t want to be on that team .
i want to be on this team .
we thought a lot about this , man .
it' s a great opportunity .
no , this right here is a great opportunity .
this business is the one that has limits .
and we' ve reached them , okay ?
me and phil , we got responsibilities to think about .
we got futures to take into consideration .
what about now ?
what about the kids ?
these kids were fine before daddy day care .
they' il be fine when it' s over .
you tell yourself that , charlie .
i finally found a place where i fit in ... where i feel like i' m doing something good , and you guys just ...
you just spoil it all .
that couldn' t have gone worse .
if you think that went bad , wait till we tell the kids .
can i go to work with you ?
no , you can' t go to work with me , but you can come visit me at work .
and daddy will be home at night and on the weekends .
we' il still have lots of fun together .
will phil and marvin still be here ?
no , i' m sorry , little man .
they won' t be around anymore .
it' s just for a while , right ?
then you' re going to come back and do daddy day care again .
no , this is from now on .
daddy day care , we' re not doing that anymore , ben .
if daddy does this , i can get money for us .
and i can use that money to take care of the house and to buy food ... and clothes and toys for you to play with .
i' il sell all my toys .
why you want to sell all your toys ?
if i don' t have toys , we don' t need money , and you can stay with me .
i wish it was that simple , ben .
the development department will have the first samples ready by next week .
okay , let' s kick it around .
what do you think of when you think of cotton candy ?
clowns .
chocolate .
cavities .
hyperactivity , cavities , and dentist bills .

red dye number four and sugar .
you know what ?
charlie is absolutely right .
you can' t ignore the reality .
parents are not going to want to buy this product for their kids .
not unless those kids stomp and scream ... and bang their little heads on the floor till blood comes out of their ears .
charlie , you got those figures that i gave you ?
yeah , i got them right here .
just give me a second to ...
we had an independent marketing firm do some preliminary research ... to sort out the core value of this product .
the subjects that were tested , aged two to six ... which are key branding years ...
charlie , you want to join us ?
i' m sorry about that , jim .
yeah .
why don' t you tell everybody what the core value is ?
what' s the most important thing ?
my kid .

a literal reader of the text might say ... that goldilocks ate the " porridge " ... because she was " hungry .
but what would freud say ?
language skills are a critical component of childhood development .
they' re part of the core curriculum here at chapman .
if you' il follow me this way .
on the path of life , the proper first steps are essential .
with our firm guidance , your children ... will take those steps right here at chapman .
our philosophy is that a child is like a climbing vine .
with structure to cling to , and the right gardener to tend them ...
they' il grow to the sky .
that' s the dumbest thing i ever heard .
we' re not talking about plants , we' re talking about kids .
i know you don' t want this woman pruning and cutting and weeding your 3 year olds .
some people are uncomfortable with achievement .
no , what i' m uncomfortable with is treating a little kid like it' s an adult .
if your kids come here , they' il be miserable in four different languages .
five .
we start portuguese in the fall .
how many languages do you listen to them in ?
you ever stop trying to shove knowledge down their throat and just talk to them ?
listen to what they want .
they' re children , they don' t know what they want .
yes , they do know what they want .
all of them .
and they' re all different .
we took some time , talked to the kids , got to know them a bit .
it made a difference .
it helped them .
please .
share your success .
why don' t you tell these people exactly how you help their children ?
max over here is potty trained now , okay ?

and becca learned how to read .

any boob can run a child care center .
it takes a family to raise some children .
we' re going to be a family from now on .
