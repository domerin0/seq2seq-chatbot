dead means they' re broken ?
well , their bodies are broken , yes .
and they' re under the ground ?
their bodies are , yes .
tell me what dead is .
mmm .
when you ...
when you look at the photographs ofthomas and timothy , do you remember the stories of what they' re doing ?
yes .
hmm , well ,
tom and timmy are alive in your imagination .
it makes me sad to think about them .
makes me sad too , ruthie .
but mommy' s sadder .
well , yes .
uh huh .
does your son have a driver' s license ?
huh !
ooh !
jesus .
heh !
you don' t have to yell , minty .
yeah ?
well , let me consider it , will ya ?
yeah .
all right .
i' il call you back .
bye .
eh , it still gets cold in the evening , huh ?
thanks .
jesus .
look at this yard .
we should clear out some of these straggly looking flower beds .
i want to put in a swimming pool .
why ?
oh , for ruth when she gets older .
something like the one we had in providence .
they loved it .
and the lawn ...
it ought to be more like an athletic field .
no .
look at this picture .
who is he ?
that' s minty o' hare' s son ... the boys ' english teacher from exeter .
he wants a summer job .
he wants to be a writer .
what would he do for you ?
it' s mainly for the experience , i suppose .
i mean , if he' s thinking about becoming a writer , he should see how one works , see what it takes .
what would he actually do for you ?
mmm , well ...
i' ve been thinking .
i want to try separating ... for the summer .
just temporarily .
so you began your career writing novels ?
yes , but they were terrible novels .
uh , unfortunately i had to write three of them ... before i realized i am not a writer of adult fiction .
i am simply a entertainer of children , and i like to draw .
edward , don' t be nervous because he' s famous .
he' s an exonion .
his sons were charming boys ... but ... mediocre students .
why do cautionary tales for children come so naturally to you ?
they were both in my class .
well , i think i can imagine their fears and express them .
um , in my stories , anyway , uh , you can see what' s coming , but you don' t see everything that' s coming .
just pick up what you can .
note his work habits .
see if there' s a method to his madness .
and ... above all ... throw yourself in headlong and just do whatever it is he wants you to do .
in my opinion , there is no better opening to any story than the opening of the mouse crawling between the walls .
i mean , the first lines ...
tom woke up , but tim did not .
daddy , i had a dream .
i heard a sound .
uh , what sort of sound , ruth ?
it' s in the house , but it' s trying to be quiet .
hmm .
well , let' s go look for it then .
it' s a sound that' s trying to be quiet ?
what did it sound like ?
it was a sound like someone trying not to make a sound .
your penis looks funny .
my penis is funny .
come out sound .
come out sound .
i' il tell you a story about a different sound .
one night when thomas was just your age , and timothy was still in diapers ,
tommy heard a sound .
did they both wake up ?
oh , tom woke up , but tim did not .
and tom woke up his father ... and asked him , " did you hear that sound ?
there' s the sound again , " tom whispered to his father .
it' s a monster ! " he cried .
it' s just a mouse ... crawling between the walls , " his father said , and thumped the wall hard with his hand .
and the mouse ... [ fingers scuffling ]
scurried away .
it' s just a mouse .
that' s all , " tom said .
and he quickly fell asleep .
but tim , he stayed awake all night long .
and every time that thing crawling between the walls came crawling back , he' d hit the wall , and he' d listen to the monster ... scurry away , dragging his thick , wet fur , and no arms and no legs with it .
and that ...
is the end of the story .
where' s mommy ?
mommy , uh ...
it' s her turn at the other house , remember ?
it' s my turn tomorrow night .
but she' il be here in the morning , okay ?
okay .
" are there any mice in this house ?
hmm .
everyone has mice .
mice are everywhere .
see you in the morning , ruthie .
eddie ?
eddie ?
mrs. cole ?
marion .
come .
you can drive , can' t you ?
oh , yeah .
yes i can .
i know boys your age .
they love to drive every chance they get .
yes , ma' am .
but i don' t know how to drive a stick .
it' s an automatic .
okay .
yes , ma' am .
sorry about before .
i was ...
i was expecting mr. cole .
ted lost his license three months ago .
you' re not at exeter anymore .
you can call us by our first names .
okay .
aren' t you coming in ?
not tonight .
did it hurt ?
does it hurt much ?
no , i' m all right .
i' m all right .
don' t worry about me .
eddie !
it is an honor to meet you , sir .
ah .
i want to thank you in advance for this experience .
ah , well , i hope you find it worthwhile .
ed , this is doctor loomis .
eddie' s my new assistant .
hi .
hi .
yeah .
exeter , ' 05 .
i was class of' 61 .
good stuff .
so , tuesday , yeah ?
right .
see you then .
tuesday , yeah .
nice to meet you , eddie .
ciao .
i' ve read all your novels and all your children' s books ... 3 : 30 ?
yeah , 3 : 30 .
got it .
i' ve ...
i read all your novels and all your children' s books , and my favorite is the door in the floor .
ahh .
well , you' re probably one of the few people on earth who have read all my novels .
so , uh , what makes you think you want to be a writer , eddie ?
oh , i wrote something , and i brought it with me .
i' d be extremely honored if you might read it , whenever you' re not busy , of course .
well , writing is rigorous work .
i keep myself incredibly busy .
yeah .
many of my books contain 500 words or less , so ... every word must be examined and re examined thoroughly .
okay .
you' re going to be spending the whole summer looking for " le motjuste , " as flaubert says .
oh .
the right word .
the true word .
" okay .
well ,
i' m prepared to throw myself in headlong and do whatever you need me to do .
yeah , because i' m sure there' il be many different tasks that will come up .
oh , all right .
for example , i need squid .
i' m , uh , using squid ink for my new book , and for all my drawings now .
there' s a , uh ... a woman in montauk , she' s a fishmonger .
she collects the squid ink for me .
should i go today ?
ah , you can go tomorrow .
you see her husband over there , don' t mention my name .
also , i have to tell you " ...
because it' s a little complicated " ... you' ve arrived here during what is a sad time in a long , happy marriage .
uh , marion and i , we' re separating ... temporarily , on a trial basis .
and i' ve , uh ...
i' ve rented a small apartment in town , and every other night one of us will be spending the night there .
uh , during the day , you' il work there at the apartment while i' m working here , but you' il sleep here .
i know it seems unnecessarily complicated , but ... it' s hard to know what' s ... what' s best for my daughter .
anyway , your bedroom is in the main house , upstairs , second door on the left .
uh , you want to take your stuff up there , relax ?
or you wanna take a shower ?
unpack .
okay , well , make yourself comfortable , eddie .
thank you , sir .
and ...
i' m sorry about your marriage .
me too , eddie .
anyway ,
i' m sure you' re gonna do great here .
it' s gonna be a good summer for ya .
i' m glad to have ya .

woman singing , indistinct ]
did you see the shrine ?
mm hmm .
it' s kinda creepy , huh ?
it' s sad .
you go to exeter , right ?
yeah , i' m an upper .
an " upper " ?
yeah , like , an upperclassman ...
like , kind of like a junior .
your father' s a teacher there , right ?
so you get to go for free ?
yeah .
he was their teacher , right ?
so that' s why you' re here ?
i guess .
did you know them before they died ?
uh , no , but i heard a lot about them .
when i was in eighth grade i used to date a senior from exeter .
really ?
yeah .
he was older than you , of course .
his name was , like , chickie or chuckie or something .
it was probably a nickname .
you know , it ... it' s quite common to have a nickname there .
it is .
oh , great , you got it .
just in time .
yes , sir .
uh , here , wait .
just a second .
here .
i want you to , uh , put it in here and then freeze it .
what should i do next ?
i' m sketching a model .
why don' t you go to the beach , take a swim ?
i ...
i could straighten up the work room or something else .
no , no .
go ahead .
anything really .
i just want to help .
no , that' s all right .
contemplating the waves ... will be a hell of a lot more useful to you as a young writer than watching me draw .
okay .
there' il be , uh , plenty more rigorous work to do ... at some point in the near future .
don' t spill that stuff .
take your dress off , please .
and your bra .
morning , eddie .
morning , ma' am .
" [ people whooping ]
" [ woman ]
bright , yeah . !
colors . !
hi .
hi .
did you just see that movie ?
yes .
me too .
is that your dinner ?
sort of , yeah .
i ... got kind of tired of burgers .
i' ve had one every night since i got here .
ted doesn' t get you anything ?
not really .
i mean , he would .
it' s just , i don' t think ruth likes to eat with me .
i don' t think your parents would like it if they thought we weren' t taking care of you .
they wouldn' t mind , really , i don' t think .
eddie , would you like to go to dinner one night ?
i' il make sure you get something ... decent .
okay .
okay ?
yeah .
good .
thanks .
good night .
see you .
bye .
eddie ?
just one second . !
uh , ruth wanted to be sure that one of the photographs was still here .
she gets anxious if she can' t see them or if they get moved .
which one was it , sweetie ?
there it is .
ahh .
he' s just a little broken , but he won' t die , right ?
right .
not yet .
no .
ruthie had a dream .
where' s feet ?
" hmm ?
what are you talking about ?
where are the feet ?
sorry , eddie .
we' ve gotten in the habit of showing ruth these pictures , and if we don' t she gets very worked up .
that' s okay .
you can see them anytime .
ahh , see ?
see you in the morning , eddie .
" [ ruth ]
what did he do ?
" [ door opens , shuts ]
that' s mrs. vaughn .
came over to discuss some sketches .
had some questions about them .
uh , guess she' s an early riser .
do you want me to drive you home now , or ...
uh , no .
i' m gonna ...
i' m gonna walk .
i left the revisions on my desk .
hmm ?
um , after i finish , what should i do next ?
i' il let you know .
eddie , i should have knocked .
it' s my fault .
i i' m not angry .
i " ...
i' m just ...
i' m just embarrassed .
eddie ?
come here , please .
it' s funny .
let' s just call it funny and leave it at that .
eddie ?
look at me .
sit .
i know boys your age .
i know it' s what boys your age do , isn' t it ?
look , eddie , i am flattered .
it felt good to know that someone was at least thinking about me .
oh , not to assume that you " were thinking about me , um " ...
maybe about my clothes .
and i know you probably have so many girls you think about .
i didn' t ...
i think about what you were wearing when i first met you .
it was a pink sweater , buttons up the front .
oh !
that sweater , it' s so old .
because of how it must feel against your skin .
oh .
would you do me a favor ?
take this down with you .
please ?
all right .
thank you .
i' il probably be about an hour .
here .
why don' t you go over the revisions ?
hey , do you want your supplies ?
oh , yeah .
hi .
you look nice .
the tie or the jacket .
you really don' t need both .
okay .
how' s the work going for you ?
i just retype " a sound like someone " trying not to make a sound every morning .
sometimes he changes a comma from a semicolon , and then the next morning he changes it back .
he needs a computer .
ted needs a driver .
that' s why he hired you , because he needs a driver .
i don' t get to drive much at home , so ...
eddie , you' re so serious .
boys your age shouldn' t be so serious .
i know a joke , [ laughs ]
but it' s not very good .
tell me .
there' s this battleship out in the ocean , and the captain of it , captain stern , this captain learns that the mother of one of his sailors just died .
mm hmm .
and the sailor' s name is midshipman abernathy .
so the captain thinks and thinks , and he tries to come up with the best way to tell abernathy that his mother died .
and finally after staying up all night , he comes up with a nice way of telling him .
so the next morning he calls the crew up on deck and says ,
gentlemen , all of you whose mothers are still living , step forward .
not so fast , abernathy .
i i like that joke , eddie .
i ...
no , it' s a ... it' s a dumb joke .
i do .
i do .
why don' t you ask alice out on a date ?
she' s not my type .
well , she' s a good nanny anyway .
i think it was wrong of us to have had ruth .
when we first moved here , the idea was , a new place , a new child , a new life , i suppose .
ted' s a good father .
but he doesn' t really know how to do all the stuff you have to do .
and i can' t .
i can' t with her .
i picked that one because they' re in silhouette , and you can almost imagine what they would look like now .
timothy looks guilty .
thomas looks like a wild animal .
this one' s funny .
tommy looks so ... scared .
i hope i' m not disturbing you .
oh , no .
no , not at all .
you can tell in this picture ...
timothy is more introspective ,
like you .
and you know where this is ?
what does it say ?
" come hither , boys , and become men .
not pink with lilac .
oh .
i wasn' t thinking about the colors .
i don' t know if they had sex .
thomas , maybe .
he was so popular .
but , timothy , he was so shy .
that' s all boys want , isn' t it ?
yes .
before i die .
have you had sex , eddie ?
no .
well , it' s too hot in here , so i hope you' il forgive me if i don' t wear the sweater .
you still really haven' t had sex , have you , eddie ?
not really .
no , not really .
but i feel ...
i feel complete .
come here .
there was a little boy who didn' t know ifhe wanted to be born .
" his mommy didn' t know if she wanted him to be born either .
they lived in a cabin in the woods on an island in a lake ,
and there was no one else around .
and in the cabin there was a door in the floor .
the little boy was afraid of what was under the door in the floor ,
and the mommy was afraid too .
once , long ago , other children had come to visit the cabin for christmas ,
but the children had opened the door in the floor ...
and had disappeared down the hole .
the mommy had tried to look for the children ,
but when she opened the door in the floor she heard such an awful sound ...
that her hair turned completely white ...
like the hair of a ghost .
and the mommy had also seen some things ,
things so horrible you can' t imagine them .
" and so the mommy wondered ... " if she wanted to have a little boy ,
especially because of everything that might be under the door in the floor .
and then she thought , ' why not ?
i' il just tell him not to open the door in the floor . '
yet the little boy ...
still didn' t know if he wanted to be born ...
into a world where there was a door in the floor .
" but there were some beautiful things in the woods , " on the island and in the lake .
" ' why not take a chance ? ' he thought .
" and so the little boy was born and he was happy , " and his mommy was happy again too .
although she told the boy ...
at least once every day ,
' don' t ever , not ever ,
' never , never , never ...
open the door in the floor . '
but , of course , he was only a little boy .
" if you were that little boy , wouldn' t you want to open that door in the floor ?
the publisher thinks the drawings are too rudimentary and there are too few of them .
but , um , i' m just an entertainer of children , and i like to draw .
nudes , uh ...
nudes are a requisite fundamental exercise for anyone who draws ,
like ... like landscapes .
so you do landscapes too ?
no .
long island' s too flat .
you don' t prefer to use professional models ?
if nakedness ...
i mean , the feeling of nakedness ... is what a nude must convey , well , there' s no nakedness that compares to what it feels like to be naked in front of someone for the first time .
hmm ?
right , eddie ?
yes .
yeah .
no .
woman singing , indistinct ]
i' m grateful to you , eddie .
oh , it' s my pleasure .
it was very interesting .
no , i mean , uh ,
i' m grateful to you for being such a good friend to marion .
she' s been so unhappy .
it' s good to see her smiling again .
hello , cole residence .
no , he' s not here yet .
should i go look for him ?
unsteady ?
excuse me , mr. cole .
um , patrick called from bobby van' s restaurant .
he said you might want a ride home .
i have a ride .
go on home , eddie .
sorry , mr. cole .
good night .
ready , eddie ?
yup .
ahh .
i , uh , converted this barn into a squash court when i first bought the place .
not quite regulation in its dimensions .
plus , uh , there' s a dead spot in the floor by the back walls .
so , basically , i' m considered even by the best players on the island ... to be unbeatable on my own court .
you play much ?
um , this is my third time .
ahh , well , don' t expect mercy from me .
i' m gonna grind you into a fine powder .
huh !
where those red lines intersect , that' s called the " t.
whoever controls the " t " controls the game .
you need to win control of the " t " if you hope to win the game .
7 love .
aah !
jesus !
you all right ?
yeah , i' m fine .
yeah , it was a good shot though .
still made it to the wall .
isn' t that a let ?
aren' t you supposed to just take the let and not hit the guy ?
well , technically you' re right , but i' il take the point .
can' t just take the " t.
you gotta earn it .
aah !
9 0 , 9 1 , 9 0 .
you look like a boy who' il sleep well tonight .
maybe you need to catch up on your sleep anyway , hmm ?
stop screaming , honey .
it' s okay .
it' s just eddie and me .
g go back to bed , okay ?
okay ?
okay .
did you get the stamps ?
ah , two rolls .
they still have the ones with the nocturnal animals ?
mm hmm .
anyway , i , uh ... [ vehicles zooming ]
i presume it was marion' s mistake , but surely it was a mistake for the two of you to let ruth see you together .
i' m not threatening you , eddie , but i must tell you ... that , uh , you may be called upon to testify .
testify ?
in the event of a custody dispute , regarding which one of us is a more fit parent .
i would never have let a child see me with another woman , whereas marion ... has really made no effort whatsoever to protect ruth ... from seeing what she saw .
and if you are asked to testify to what happened ,
i trust that you won' t lie ... not in a court of law .
from the sound of it , it was a rear entry position ... not that i have a personal problem with that or any other position .
but for a child ,
i imagine doing it doggishly ... must seem especially animalistic .
i' il only be about 25 minutes today .
just a quick sketch .
i' ve never been unfaithful to ted .
why didn' t you leave him ?
ted understands me .
ted' s the only one that really knows what happened to me .
you don' t need some time ?
aah !
what are you doing ?
okay .
ready ?
he starts with conventional portraits " ... a mother , a child .
then the mother , then the mother nude .
then the nudes go through phases ,
like innocence , modesty , degradation ... and shame .
mrs. vaughn ?
mrs. vaughn is experiencing the ... degrading phase right now .
move your head to the light .
to the " ... evelyn , more to the light .
evelyn .
i want to know more about you .
you know too much already .
tell me about the accident .
i mean , do you know how it happened , or ... or was it anybody' s fault ?
marion ?
m marion ?
mommy .
mommy .
it was early in the morning , and mommy was just waking up .
thomas and timothy crawled under the covers .
and daddy took the picture in france .
but what did you did to the feet ?
well , maybe it never happened .
you know , maybe it was just a dream .
no .
i guess it' s just a mystery .
no , it was paper .
don' t you want to go back to bed ?
yes .
bring the picture .
it' s my picture .
it' s not yours .
that' s true .
mommy . !
mommy . !
ow .
ow . !
she cut her finger , badly .
ow .
shh .
it' s okay .
am i going to die ?
no .
you' re not going to die .
you' re not going to die .
you don' t understand .
i put the picture in her room .
it' s my fault .
that' s not the point .
the point is , you shouldn' t have gone into her room in the first place .
that' s her mother' s job .
i told you , marion was asleep .
i doubt it .
i doubt " asleep " would accurately describe marion' s condition .
i did it to her .
i asked her about the accident .
ah , it doesn' t matter .
she was a great mother to the boys , but she' s for shits now .
it' s my fault .
no .
it' s marion' s fault .
ruthie , please .
mommy . !
" come on now .
go to sleep now .

i' m here , sweetie .

she heard bangs .
heard banging noise .
what kind of banging noise ?
i ...
i don' t know .
what difference does it make ?

it ...
it might be , um , awkward ... to ask for the portfolio back .
it won' t be a problem .
i i don' t really understand .
he " ...
he wants to give them to me .
he doesn' t want them ?
he said he wanted you to have them .
oh .
uh , but when is he coming ?
he' s coming friday , isn' t he ?
i have the whole day for him on friday .
he knows i have the day .
will you stop ?
is he coming on friday ?
i i don' t know .
yes , you do know .
uh ...
" did you look at those drawings ?
did he show you ?
my god , i' m locked out .
you' re gonna have to break in .
me ?
you' re gonna have to carry me over the glass .
i have bare feet .
how dare you ?
how dare you detest me ?
ow !
you' re not exactly living an " un sordid " life yourself , are you ?
just ...
please , i wanna go home .
oh , go !
why did she think you looked at the drawings ?
did you ?
no .
oh , christ .
of course you did .
no .
i didn' t .
she exposed herself to me .
jesus .
she did what ?
she didn' t mean to , but she exposed herself .
the wind , it b blew her robe open .
" jesus christ . !
and she locked herself out because of you .
she said you liked all the doors to be locked , and you didn' t like the gardener to be around .
she told you that ?
yes .
she said she had the whole day for you friday .
i can' t spend the whole day with her friday .
you' re gonna have to come and pick me up in 45 minutes .
make that a half an hour .
on friday morning , you' re going to leave him at mrs. vaughn' s .
i know " ... " for half an hour .
no .
you' re never going back , and it' il take him all day to make his way back home by himself .
mrs. vaughn won' t offer him a ride .
i don' t expect him back before dark .
ted' s gonna be really pissed off .
i read your , um ... your story .
oh .
i thought you forgot .
no .
i just didn' t have a chance to get to it before .
it' s not very good , is it ?
oh , it' s , uh ... it' s very heartfelt , very ... very personal .
it' s , um ...
well , it' s just a collection of personal anecdotes that don' t really add up to much .
it' s , uh ...
i was just tryin ' to see if i could write something that seemed true .
oh , it seems true .
it , uh , just isn' t very interesting .
sort of a ... an emotional outburst , but , uh , it isn' t really a story .
and that , uh ... the guy , hank ... you know , the one who dies at the end ?
yeah .
you need to prepare a reader for something like that .
uh ...
it just ...
it didn' t seem like the way things happened .
well , you need to let your audience guess what' s gonna happen ... you know , anticipate what' s gonna happen ... and then you surprise them .
but , um , you have to guide them through it .
you know what i mean ?
yeah .
there' s a part of writing that , uh , involves a certain manipulation .
that may seem cold to you , but it is , you know , sort of cold .
i i guess .
pain , betrayal , even death .
these are , you know ...
these are like , uh , different colors on a painter' s palette .
you need to use them .
also , the details ... they could be more specific , you know ?
specific details , they ... they create whole scenes in a reader' s mind .
not being specific , that' s just sloppy .
it' s sloppy thinking .
s specific details ?
yeah ... smells , taste ... details .
but i' il tell ya , for a , uh ... for a first effort , it' s not that bad .
you know , the , uh ...
thanks .
the prose is a little purple , a little pretentious .
thanks .
thanks anyway for reading it .
you' re welcome .

you ever think about getting a computer ?
be easier to do your own revisions that way , so you wouldn' t need an assistant .
maybe the next book .
yeah .
oh , boy .
uh , you better wait for me .
i' m not gonna last a half hour with this woman .
twenty minutes tops , maybe 10 .
five .
ifhe hits you , hit him back .
he won' t make a fist .
at worst , he' il slap you .

you better start to like her a little .
when ted kicks you out , you' re going to need a ride to the ferry at orient point .
and who' s gonna explain this to ruth ?
i won' t be a bad mother to her .
i' d rather be no mother than to be a bad mother to her .

i don' t want her to be like me .

shut up .
mmm .
what was the title of your term paper ?
uh , " an analysis of the atavistic symbols of fear in " the door in the floor .
as you know , um , myths and fairy tales of tribal peoples are full of images ...
like magic doors and children disappearing ... and people being so frightened their hair turns white overnight .
and the vagina ?
when the , uh , little boy' s in the womb , the door in the floor is a ... vagina .

i' ve been looking for two suitable subjects for a mother and daughter portrait .
something i' m thinking about for my book .
at first i would want to draw you and your daughter together .
that way , when i draw each one of you separately , uh , the presence of the other one is ... is , uh , somehow there .
how long would it take , and ...
uh ... which one of us would you want to draw first ... separately ?
i should do glorie first .
first , uh ...
well , first , the two of you together , and then , uh ... then glorie alone , and then when glorie' s back at college , you alone .
mr. cole , you really are an enigma .
so which are you , and artist or a writer ?
oh , glorie , i' m ...
i' m neither , really .
i' m ...

for the whole rest of your life , whenever you need to feel brave , just look at your scar .
your hand will grow bigger , and your finger will grow bigger , but your scar will always stay the same size .
and it will always show up in your fingerprint .
what' s a fingerprint ?
i' il show you .
" those are my fingerprints .
ooh .

marion said it was gonna make you stop .
" marion said " ?
if she thinks she' s got a rat' s ass of a chance ... to get custody of ruth , she' s got another think coming .
she doesn' t expect to get custody of ruth .
she has no intention of trying .
she told you that ?
" she told me everything i' m telling you .
what kind of mother doesn' t even try to get custody of her daughter ?
i don' t know .
she didn' t tell me that .
god .
okay .
okay .
christ .
why ...
why did she have to take all of the photographs ?
there' re negatives .
she could have taken the negatives and had prints ofher own made .
she took the negatives too .
the hell she did .
go look for yourself .
she can' t have the photographs and the negatives .
they were my sons too .
i should have half the photographs , for chrissake .
what about ruth ?
ruth should have some of the photographs .
marion said you' d say that .
but she said no .
oh .
well , obviously , she went to new york .
i doubt it .
what do you know , eddie ?
that' s the only place she could go .
i even know where in the city she is .
i just can' t imagine her goin' to new york .
you don' t have an imagination , eddie .
christ .
aren' t you planning on getting a divorce with her anyway ?
that marion' s question , or is that your question ?
it' s mine .
eddie , just stick to what marion told you to say , okay ?
she didn' t tell me to get the photograph .
that was my idea .
well , that was a good idea .
" i was thinking of ruth .
yeah .
i know you were .
thank you .
you want a drink ?
no .
what day is tomorrow , saturday ?
yeah .
i want you out of here by tomorrow .
sunday at the latest .
that' s fine .
i just need a ride to the ferry .
alice can take you .
what about this one ?
tell it !
i' m sorry , ruth .
i don' t know .
okay ?
i just ...
this is the one with thomas in the tall hat .
timothy is trying to reach thomas' s hat .
timothy can' t reach thomas' s hat , ' cause thomas is standing on a ball .
timothy got mad and started a fight .
was the fight in the picture ?
no .
the fight was after the picture , you dummy !
okay .
we' re gonna go watch a movie .

oh , alice .

i didn' t do anything .
she was crying when i first got here .
i' ve been asking her what' s wrong , and she won' t even talk to me .
where' s ruthie ?
uh , she' s asleep .
she was crying .
i' m sorry , alice , for springing all of this on you .
fuck you , ted .
i appreciate you pickin ' up the slack .
i' ve spent years trying to get over my own fucked up family .
and i' ve done the best i could with ruth .
no .
no .
i just can' t anymore .
i' m gonna quit .
i quit .
and you should have the decency to quit too .
it' s ...
it' s too late for me to quit , alice .
i just got fired .
i never knew you were such a superior person , alice .
alice has been superior to me all summer .
haven' t you alice ?
i " am " morally superior to you , eddie .
i know that much .
morally superior .
what a concept .
don' t you ever feel morally superior , eddie ?
hmm ?
to you i do .
yeah .
you see ?
everyone feels morally superior to someone .
fuck you guys .
there goes my ride to the ferry .
oh , you' re a smart boy , eddie .
you' il think of someone to give you a ride .
you want a drink ?
no , thanks .
oh , for chrissake .
have a beer .
jesus .
look at this yard .
cannot believe she doesn' t want custody of her own daughter .
what kind of mother leaves her daughter ?
i don' t know her well enough to judge her .
let me tell you something , eddie .
i don' t know her well enough to judge her either .
yeah , well , don' t forget , it' s you she' s really leaving .
guess she knew you pretty well .
well enough to judge me , you mean ?
certainly .
but then , she' s leaving you too , isn' t she , eddie ?
you don' t expect her to call you up for a secret rendezvous , do you ?
no .
i don' t expect to hear from her .
no , me neither .
hmm .
i have drawings of her .
i drew her long ago , before the accident .
she was so ... so incredible .
so fucking beautiful .
amazing .
you should have known her then .
oh , marion .
she hated to pose for me .
these are the only drawings i kept .
i was never good enough to draw marion .
i didn' t know how to .
i didn' t have the ability , i guess .
you want one ?
you can have one .
no .
ruth should have them .
mmm .
that' s a good idea .
you' re full of good ideas , eddie .
wrong cubes .
marion ?
jesus , aren' t you the optimist ?
forget the light , eddie .
this story' s better in the dark .
what story ?
you told me you asked marion to tell it to you , but marion can' t handle this story .
turns her to stone just thinking about it .
remember , you turned her to stone just asking her about it .
i remember .
go on .
well , here' s the deal .
thomas had his driver' s license , but timothy did not .
tommy was 17 and ... been driving for a year .
timmy was 15 .
he had only started to take driving lessons .
it was ted' s opinion that timmy , who was only learning , was already a more attentive student than thomas ever had been .
timmy studied the driving manual diligently .
he was a more patient driver than thomas .
not that tommy was a bad driver .
tommy was a good driver .
he was alert , confident .
he had excellent reflexes .
and he was cynical enough to assume ... as ted had instructed him ... that every other driver is a bad driver .
who taught to you drive , eddie ?
um , my dad .
well , good for him .
tell him for me , he did an excellent job , would you ?
okay .
keep ...
keep going .
we were out west , actually , and it was after a long day of skiing .
it was snowing " ... a wet , thick snow .
at 17 and 15 , respectively ,
thomas and timothy could ski the pants off their parents .
that day , in fact , ted and marion had retired to the bar at the ski resort ... where they were waiting for a very long time ... for thomas and timothy to finish their last run ... and the last run after that .
i get the picture .
you were drunk .
well , that , uh ... that was one aspect of what would become trivial ... in the ... area of the ongoing argument between marion and ted .
i mean , marion said that ted was drunk , although in his view , he wasn' t .
marion , while not drunk , certainly had had more to drink than she was accustomed to .
besides , tommy had not been drinking .
he had his license .
there was no disagreement as to who among them should be the driver .
and , brothers being brothers ,
timmy sat beside him in the passenger seat .
and as for the parents ,
ted and marion ... sat in the backseat .
ted and marion began to quarrel ... about the best route back to the hotel .
there was gonna have to be a left turn no matter how tommy did it .
so , tommy moves into the center lane .
it' s , um , a turning lane .
it' s not a passing lane .
he puts on his blinker , not knowing that both lights are covered with wet , sticky snow ... that his father failed to clear off at the same time his father ... failed to clear off the rear window .
any cars coming up from behind tommy' s car can' t see the directional signals or ... the brake lights or the tail lights .
the car is not visible , or it' s visible only at the last second to any ... anyone approaching from behind .
and then , the interior of the car is filled with light .
" it' s the headlights from the car " coming up from behind .
" [ no audible crash ]
the snowplow cut the car almost perfectly in half .
tommy was killed by the steering column .
crushed his chest .
died instantly .
and ted ... was trapped in the backseat for all of 20 minutes .
he ...
he couldn' t see tommy , but he knew he was dead because marion could see him .
she couldn' t see timmy .
he was directly in front ofher .
ted , however , could see that timmy was still breathing .
ted could also see that the snowplow , as it cut the car in half , also cut timmy' s left leg off at the thigh .
timothy cole bled to death of a severed femoral artery .
marion knew that tommy was dead , but only that timmy had been carried from the wreckage , hopefully ... to the hospital .
and then marion , she sees timmy' s shoe in the wreckage .
" oh , look .
timmy' s shoe .
he' s gonna need his shoe .
and she walks over to it , reaches down to pick it up .
ted ...
ted wanted to stop her .
talk about turned to stone .
i couldn' t move .
i couldn' t even speak .
and that was when ted allowed his wife to discover ... that her younger son' s shoe was attached ... to a leg .
and that was when marion realized that timmy was gone ... too .
and that ... that is the end of the story .
i hired you , eddie , because you look like thomas .
i gave her you .
see you in the morning , eddie .
it' s eduardo .
what' s eduardo doing here ?
i don' t know .
maybe mrs. vaughn hired him to kill you .
no , no .
not ...
not eduardo .
you don' t see her out there anywhere , do you ?
she' s not in the cab or in the back .
maybe she' s lying underneath the truck .
i' m being serious , for chrissake .
so am i.
why ...
why don' t you go out there and , um , see what he wants ?
not me .
i' ve been fired .
oh , for chrissake .
what ?
wha ...
at least go with me then .
i can' t go out there alone .
mrs. vaughn fired me .
eduardo , eduardo , eduardo .
let me make sure i understand you .
you think you saved my life , and this cost you your job ?
yes , i did save your life , and it did cost me my job .
well , eduardo ,
i play squash regularly , and i' m pretty fleet of foot , um , but i do ...
i do appreciate your brave warning .
how much money are we talking about exactly ?
i' m not here for a " hand down , " mr. cole .
i was hoping you might have some work for me .
ah .
let me ...
let me show you where i want to put a pool .
i want , uh , more lawn , like an athletic field , you know ?
just , uh , pretty big .
you want some lines painted on it ?
no , no .
just the size of an athletic field .
wow .
that' s a lotta lawn .
a lotta mowin ' .
all right .
and a lot of fertilizers .
yeah .
well , whatever you say .
i' m putting you in charge .
thank you , mr. cole .
what about your wife ?
what about her ?
oh , uh , does she work , or what does she do ?
yeah , sure .
sure , she works .
she cooks , she look after our children .
mmm .
maybe , uh ...
maybe she' d like to clean my house .
or maybe she' d like to cook for me and , uh ,
look after my daughter , ruth .
sure .
i' il ask her .
yeah ?
good .
good .
excellent .
gotta do something about these straggly flower beds too .
oh .
you can start today , eduardo .
you can begin by taking my former assistant to orient point , hmm ?
sure .
i can do that .
uh , immediately .
before breakfast , huh ?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
well , you' re a fairly good driver , eddie .
about marion , there' s another thing you should know .
even before the accident ...
i mean , even ... even if there had never been an accident , she still would be difficult .
i don' t believe it .
about the shoe , it was a basketball shoe ... an " airjordan , " i think he called it .
specific details , eddie .
specific details .
