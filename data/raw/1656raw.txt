hey , you rhinos have really tiny brains , do you know that ?
it' s just a fact .
you probably don' t know what i' m talking about .

i thought rhinos are vegetarians .
an excellent point .
shut up !
who says we gonna eat him after we kill him ?
come on , move it .
you know , i don' t like animals who kill for pleasure .
save it , for a mammal that cares .
i' m a mammal that cares .
okay , look .
if either of you make it across that sink hole in front of you , you get the sloth .
that' s right , you losers .
you take a step and you' re dead .
you' re bluffing , huh ?
yeah , that was a bluff .
go !
a dandelion ?
we did it !
what ?
you have beautiful eyes .
get off my face .
you and me , we make a great team .
what do you say we just head south together ?
yeah , jump on my back and relax the whole way .
really ?
no .
wait , aren' t you going south ?
the changing season , migration instincts ?
any of this ringing a bell ?
i guess not , bye .
okay , thanks for the help .
i can take it from here .
hey , you over grown weasel .
wait till we get down there .
the whole south thing is way over rated .
the heat , the crowd .
this great .
you and me , two bachelors knocking about in the wild .
no , you just want a bodyguard so you don' t become somebody' s side dish .
you' re very strut mammoth .
can you lead the way , mr. big guy ?
manfred .
how about manny the moody mammoth or nanny the ...
stop following me .
okay , so you got it .
you won' t even know i' m here .
i' il just zip the lip when i say ...
look at the cute little baby , diego .
isn' t it nice if he' s joining us for breakfast ?
it wouldn' t be breakfast without him .
his daddy wiped out half our pack .
and rag our skin to keep warm .
an eye for an eye .
don' t you think ?
let show that human what happen when he messed with sabers .
alert the troops .
we attack at dawn .
and diego , bring me that baby .
alive .
if i' m gonna enjoy my revenge , i want it to be fresh .
i' m wiped out .
that' s your shelter ?
you' re a big guy .
you got a lot of wood .
i' m a little guy .
you only got half a stick .
yeah , but with my little stick , and my highly evolved brain ...
i' il shall create fire .
fascinating .
we' il see if brains triumph over brawn tonight .
now won' t we ?
hey , i think i saw a spark .
any chance i can squeeze in there with you ?
isn' t there someone else you can annoy ?
friends ?
family ?
poison reptiles ?
my family abandoned me .
they just kind of migrated without me .
you should see what they did last year .
they woke up early and they tied my hands and feet together .
they buried the cave door , and covered their tracks .
who needs them anyway .
so what about you ?
you have family ?
okay , you' re tired , i see .
we' il talk more in the morning .
manfred ?
manfred .
could you move over ?
come on , nobody fall asleep that fast .
manny !
that' s diego , fall back !
where' s the baby ?
i lost it over the falls .
you lost it ?
i want that baby , diego .
i' il get it .
you better .
unless you want to serve yourself as the replacement .
we' il go up to half peak .
meet us there .
it' d better be alive .
can we trust you with that , diego ?
let' s go !
and you pick this year off my shoulders .
if you gonna have a mating partner , at least pick a female with the same color palette , right ?
and i thought , wow , he' s gonna go primal , you know what i' m saying ?
if you find a mate in life , you should be loyal .
in your case , it' s grateful .
get away from me .
well , i think mate in life is stupid .
i mean there' s plenty of sid to go around ...
manny ?
look at that .
he' s okay .
she' s gone .
hey , manny , are you forgetting something ?
no .
but you just saved him .
yeah , but i' m still trying to get rid of the last thing i saved .
you can' t leave him here .
look , there' s smoke .
that' s his herd right up the hill .
we should return him .
let' s get something straight .
there' s no " we " .
there never was a " we " .
in fact , without me , there wouldn' t even be a " you " !
just up the hill .
listen very carefully .
i' m not g o i n g .
fine .
be a jerk .
i' il take care of him .
go .
yeah , that' s good .
you take care of him ?
you can' t even take care of yourself .
this i gotta see .
i' il return you .
we don' t need that manny .
you know we don' t .
you' re an embarrassment the nature , do you know that ?
i' m fine .
i' m fine !
i' m gonna die .
that thing is mine .
no , actually that thing belongs to us .
us ?
you two are an odd couple .
there is no " us " .
i see .
you can' t have one of your own so you want to adopt .
look , i' m sorry to interrupt this .
but we gotta go .
the baby , please .
i' m returning to his herd .
oh , yeah .
nice try , bucktooth .
you' re calling me a liar ?
i didn' t say that .
you were thinking it .
i don' t like this cat .
he reads mind .
name is diego , friend .
manfred .
and i' m not your friend .
fine , manfred .
if you' re looking for the humans , you' re wasting your time . they left this morning .
thanks for the advice .
now beat it .
all right , i' il help you bring it to its herd .
but promise me that you' d leave me alone after that .
okay , deal .
what' s your problem ?
you' re my problem .
but i think you' re stressed .
that' s why you eat so much .
it' s hard to get fat on a diet .
i' m not fat .
it' s all this fur .
it makes me look puffy .
all right , yeah .
fat hair .
but when you' re ready to talk , i' m here .
just drop it on the ledge .
shouldn' t we make sure they found him ?
good idea .
no , no , no !
wait .
don' t spear me !
this is a problem .
now what ?
that' s perfect .
i told you they were gone .
look who it is .
don' t you have some poor defenseless animals to disembowel ?
they couldn' t be far .
they went this way ?
or this way ?
you don' t know much about tracking , do you ?
i' m a sloth .
i see a tree , eat a leave , that' s my tracking .
you didn' t miss them by much .
it' s still green .
they head north 2 hours ago .
still green .
they head north 2 hours ago .
you don' t need this aggravation .
give me the baby .
i can track humans down faster than you can .
and you' re just a good citizen helping out , right ?
i just know where the humans will go .
glacier pass .
everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side .
unless you know how to track , you never gonna reach them before their pass closed up with snow .
which should be like , tomorrow .
so you can give that baby to me or go get lost in the blizzard .
it' s your choice .
here' s your little bundle of joy .
we' il return it to the human .
big bad tiggy wiggy gets left behind .
poor tiggy wiggy ...
sid , tiggy wiggy is gonna lead the way .
manny , can i talk to you for a second ?
no .
the sooner we find the humans , the sooner i get rid of mr. stinky drew face .
and the baby too .
you won' t always have jumbo around to protect you .
and when that day comes , i suggest you watch your back .
cause i' il be chewing on it .
human tracker , up front where i can see you .
help me .
you gotta make it stop .
i can' t take it anymore !
i' ve eaten things that didn' t complain as much .
stop shouting at me .
you' re holding it wrong .
watch its head !
just put it down .
its nose is dry .
that means something is wrong with it .
maybe we should lick it .
just in case .
i' il do it .
you know , its wearing one of those baby thingies .
so if it poops , where does it go ?
humans are disgusting .
okay , you .
check for poop .
why am i the poop checker ?
because returning it was your idea .
because you' re small and insignificant
and because i' il pound you if you don' t .
what else ?
now , sid !
i mean , my goodness .
all right , look out .
coming through .
watch out !
stop waving it around !
oh , i' m gonna slip !
it' s clean !
got you !
would you cut it out !
hey , do that again .
he likes it .
that makes me feel better too .
turn him towards me .
where is the baby ?
there it is !
where is the baby ?
there it is !
stop it !
you' re scaring it !
i bet he' s hungry .
how about some milk ?
i' d love some .

survival separates the dodo from the beasts !
protect the dodo way of life !

intruders !
don' t fall in .
if you do , you' il definately ...
intruders !
burn and die .
hey , can we have our melon back ?
junior is hungry and ...
no way !
this is our private stock pile for ice age .
sub artic temperatures will force us underground for billions billions years .
so you got three melons ?
if you weren' t smart enough to plan ahead , then doom on you .
get away from me .
no !
retrieve the melon !
attack !
the melon !
there goes our last female .
the last melon !
ahhh , sid .
now we gotta find more food .
look at that .
dinner and a show .
now to find a meal be fitting a conquering hero .

a foe ?
come on , you wanna a piece of me ?

tigers are just playing with the antilopes .
with their teeth .
come on sid .
somebody pinch me .
look !
this fat one looks just like you .
look he is playing with his kid .

that' s what mammoths are supposed to do .
find a she moth , have little baby mammoths ...
sid .
