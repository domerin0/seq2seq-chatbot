in the beginning ... there was nothing .
there was only music .
mexico ...
beneath your merry sun
time flies by on swift wings as my happy heart sings
the first day , he made the sun .
it stings the eyes .
and then , he made the earth ...
the second day , he made the sea .
it wets your feet .
the wind tickles ...
the third day , he made records .
people born in america speak english .
i don' t know where i was born .
i think it was in mongolia .
the fourth day , he made television .
i use dentofresh daily .
pour the sauce over the pear after poaching it in a light cinnamon and lemon syrup .
the fifth day , he made the grass .
when you cut it , it cries .
you have to comfort it , speak kindly to it .
if you touch a tree , you become a tree .
if you close your eyes , you become an ant .
the sixth day , he made men .
they come in all colours .
there' s blue .
there' s black .
there' s red .
there' s white .
there' s orange too .
red .
green .
blue .
butterflies .
blue , white , grey or black
swift , mad , light , fluttering and proud
butterflies , in flowery flight with their wings form a cloud
nathalie is a woman .
i prefer women because they don' t prickle when you kiss them .
later , i' m going to get married to nathalie .
wedding with me ?
i can' t .
i' m already in love with johnny halliday .
that' s okay .
you' re very , very pretty .
look , you' re beautiful .
look .
you' re beautiful .
don' t go too far !
to have a baby , a man and a woman look at each other .
they don' t know each other .
so they get married .
put a bit more confidence in your look , please .
i' m sorry ?
confidence in what ?
in the future .
they do a wedding .
they kiss on the lips like on television and ... a little seed turns up !
if it' s a boy , they call him ...
georges .
on sunday , he rested .
that was the seventh day .
the elghth day
please extinguish all cigarettes and fasten your seat belts .
remain seated until the plane come to a complete stop .
bags can be collected at gate b of the terminal .
if you have nothing to declare , please follow the white arrows .
if you have goods to declare , follow the red arrows .
this concerns you all because everyone sells .
we all sell ourselves some day .
keep four basic rules .
iook your customer in the eye .
two : smile .
three : give an impression of success .
people prefer an achiever to a loser .
and four : be enthusiastic .
enthusiasm is contagious .
dad , mom can' t bring us on friday .
you have to fetch us .
it' s 7 : 30 .
good morning .
another sunny day .
temperatures around 68 to 71 with a high of 77 in the south .
have the unshakeable conviction you' il win .
think positive .
only use positive words .
eliminate all negative words .
be proud but don' t go smiling in the mirror every morning .
be proud of yourselves , yourselves and your bank .
green ...
it' s 7 : 30 .
rise and shine !
a mild morning and a sunny afternoon .
the warm , dry weather should last until wednesday .
you' re seeing weston at 11 : 30 and general at 11 : 45 .
change it .
keep 30 minutes for weston , they' re important .
your wife called about ...
i know but i' m too busy to fetch them .
get her to put the kids on the train .
i' il pick them up .
say i' il definitely be there .
try to resemble your customer .
observe him .
adopt his gestures , poses and intonation .
two similar people hook up more easily than two dissimilar people .
your customer will never notice the imitation , i promise .
similarity goes unnoticed .
only difference shocks people .

mother of mine
the sweetest in creation in every land or nation
no other gives such love
for me you shine
so sweet and so humble
with the face of an angel
from heaven above
as i travel lands far away
seeing new places every day
nothing will ever outweigh
the sight of you i love
mother of mine
the sweetest in creation
my heart knows true elation
when your arm
mother , dear , rests on my arm
mother of mine
the sweetest in creation
for love' s illumination
fills your sweet gaze
for you it' s true
after all these years of joy
i' m still the good little boy
of the happy younger days
in the beginning , there was nothing at all .
all you could hear was music .
the first day , he made the sun .
it stings the eyes .
the second day , he made the water .
it' s wet .
it wets your feet if you walk in it .
then he made the wind .
it tickles ...
the third day , he made the grass .
when you cut it , it cries .
it suffers .
you have to comfort it .
speak kindly to it .
if you touch a tree ... you become a tree .
the fourth day , he made cows .
when they breathe , it comes out hot .
the fifth day , he made planes .
if you don' t take them , you can watch them fly past .
the sixth day , he made people .
men , women and children .
i prefer women and children because they don' t prickle when you kiss them .
the seventh day , to relax , he made clouds .
if you look hard , you can see every story in them .
then he wondered if nothing was missing .
the eighth day , he made
georges .
and he saw it was good .
