' it was the last time annie and i saw them alive . '
when death claims the life of our children ... .. we are left with too many questions .
how do we make sense of the feelings we' re left with ?
the gospel according to luke , even the first corinthians , tell us of the extraordinary paradise that awaits us .
4 years later
the lucky winner is ... jacobs !
stacy jacobs .

you weren' t looking anyway .
you like rabbits ?
yes ?
then go like this .
good .
we' ve given her mrls and ...
whoa !
wild rabbit .
watch out .
and also a cat scan , i believe .
look at that .
you have more pictures than a supermodel .
do you ever wear glasses ?
no , she doesn' t need glasses .
does your head hurt a lot ?
all the time .
cup your hand , cover your nose and mouth and breathe .
mrs nielsen on four .
that' s my wife .
if you can do it longer than she can talk , that' s an achievement .
christy , i' ve got a meltdown .
ok , take a breath .
eight pieces from germany never arrived .
i' ve gotta choose replacements the night before the opening , re hang them , re light them and i ...

it' s our double d anniversary .
i' m ruining it .
double d , yeah .
i' m sorry , i can' t leave here .
' i' m sorry . '
tell you what , how about this ...
how about the hudson rivers ?
' that gives us three . '
and the hollenbeck ...
' and the , uh , hennik 16 , 19 and 23 ... ' and the bridge .
but they' re in fairfield ...
i don' t have anybody to send .
i' il get them and take ' em to the gallery .
huh ...
you' d do that for me ?
only if you' re incredibly grateful .
that' s a chance to show yours .
it' s very sexy .
ok , weirdo ...
i' il be home late , but i' il be home .
i love you , bella .
i love you , too .
bye .
do you like art ?
my wife fixes paintings and also makes some .
to me , paintings are the most important things in the world ... next to your brain .
you feel better , don' t you ?
migraines ...
' i said , " i love you , bella .
' i' il always remember that .
' at least i got to say it . '
you all right ?
i think so .
i' m a doctor .
don' t move .
chris ?
hm ?
do you know what' s happened ?
i had a bad piece of fish before bed .
who are you ?
a doc ?
are you operating on me ?
who are you ?
why can' t i see you ?
ginger , you see me ?
she does .
dogs are different .
can you see me now ?
why are you so blurred ?
i' il get clearer .
confused how you got home so fast ?
dreams don' t deal in time .
time doesn' t count .
you' ve died , chris .
doc , if i were dead , would i need you to tell me ?
i guess you do .
everyone' s different .
i wish everybody would go home .
why do i see everyone ?
everybody but ...
you don' t wanna see me .
you don' t wanna be dead .
the kids were so young .
you want to remember your kids .
when they were still alive .
when she goes to the hospital , i' m going too .
marie ...
katie' s not ...
katie' s not going there to get better .
sugar ?
they' re gonna give her a shot
and she' il fall asleep .
you' re going to kill my dog ?
i' m going to help her die , yes .
honey , she hurts very ... .. badly and nothing can help her .
i' m going to stop that ,
because i love her .
you' re killing my dog .
you get angry .
death does that .
what' il happen to her ?
um ...
she' il go where we all go .
and how can that be bad ?
come on , dad !
oh , my leg !
thanks for not listening to mom .
about what ?
just coming out here .
this whole day .
she didn' t want us doing this , because of ... grades and stuff .
your mother and i talked .
we always listen to each other .
so , i mean , what' d you talk about ?
about taking you out of head royce .
the school is wrong for you .
while this is a time ...
while this is a time ...
where are we now ?
maybe you won' t want to stay .
this is your funeral .
what am i on ?
you' re real fuzzy .
at least you' re willing to see yourself .
you' re losing your fear .
fear ?
that you disappeared .
you didn' t .
you only died .
a woman ... who lost her children just four years ago .
every day in the lord' s prayer .
celia ... come on .
whoa .
shhhhh ...
this one is a present ... for me .
it' s our double d anniversary .
kind of our special day .
it' s her version of our place .
your place ?
where we first met .
where we were going to retire , i guess .
live out our lives .
be old farts together .
right there .
that' s our dream house .
that one' s me , i guess .
the blurry one is annie .
looks a little familiar , doc .
the funeral is over .
why is this going on past the funeral ? .
' dear diary ,
' i' m writing because my shrink is crazier than me .
' he thinks you' re therapy .
' if two babies can hammer me into a psycho ward ,
' what' il i do with this ?
' he' s so stupid .
' he thinks he pulled me through the breakdown
' when it was only christy .
' always .
only chris . '
jesus ...
' i was looking through his postcards .
' paintings were his obsession .
' he used art to love me , to help me .
' to keep us always together .
i' m here , babe .
i still exist .
you' re thinking of me .
keep thinking of me .
come on , with me .
you were always with me .
the people who finished each other' s sentences .
remember us ?
i still exist .
i still exist !
just write it down .
write it down .
this is chris .
this ... is ... chris .
i ... " still ...
exist .
read it .
read it .
christ , when does it end ?
christ , when does it end ?
there' s no rules , chris .
it ends when you want .
where were you ?
someplace else .
you think i' m a figment of your imagination ?
she' s real .
you' re real .
it' s all real .
that' s the point if there is one .
it' s over when you stop wanting to hurt her .
forever ...
don' t worry , baby ...
i' m not leaving you alone .
i' m not going anywhere .
goodbye , babe .
katie , it' s you !
you' re young again !
come here , katie !
katie , katie !
come on , hey !
boy , i screwed up .
i' m in dog heaven .
a place where we all go can' t be bad , can it , girl ? .
maybe i' m not in your heaven after all !
maybe you' re in mine !
annie !
what the hell have you done ?
that' s not how you use a stethoscope !
albert lewis ?
last time you saw me i was 63 , on a cardiac ward !
you thought i was old and decrepit , huh ?
talking about " ah , can' t go on !
who wants to be 63 throughout eternity ?
look at you on the water !
well , hello !
come on ... walk along , feel the beat !
dancing on water !
smooth as ever !
and that was you ... just now , when ... when i died .
i thought you recognised me , because you called me " doc " .
me being your favourite doc .
could you lend me a hand ?
i' m up to my ass in problems again .
oh , chris ...
come here .
you are still kinda ugly .
you taught me a lot , chief .
nice place you got here .
no , no .
nice place you got here .
me ?
sure , you' re making all this .
we' re insecure at first , so we need safety and comfort .
we all paint our surroundings , but you use real paint !
there' s so much here she didn' t paint .
like that bird .
annie gave you a start , like holding onto handrails .
you' re creating a world .
from your imagination , from anything you want .
why doesn' t it move ?
it will when you want it to .
oh hoh !
you go , boy !
can i make it dive ?
you' re the painter !
it' s your world !
look at it go !
how about turquoise wings ?
turquoise !
and a little mauve , all right !
i didn' t do that .
no , i did .
when we' re together it' s like dual controls .
can i make elephants fly ?
didn' t annie paint a house ?
yeah , it' s our dream house .
just a stroll across the water .
let' s take the shortcut .
nice shortcut .
it' s easy , look at me !
i' m gonna drown .
you' re already dead .
am i ... am i really here ?
what do you mean by " you " ?
your arm or your leg ?
partly .
really ?
and if you lost your limbs ?
i' d still be me .
what is the " me " ?
my brain , i suppose .
your brain ?
your brain is a body part .
like your fingernail or your heart .
why is that you ?
because " i " am a voice in my head .
the part that thinks , feels .
that is aware that i exist .
so if you' re aware you exist ... then you do .
that' s why you' re still here .
no windows .
what aren' t you ready to see , i wonder ?
drink it .
think it' s coffee and it will be .
ok .
it' s coffee ...
paint !
acrylic .
why is it so hard ?
what ?
your brain is meat .
it rots and disappears .
you thought that' s all there was to you ?
like you' re in your house now .
you' re in your house , you aren' t your house .
the house falls down , you walk away .
but i rebuilt , huh ?
you see your body because you like seeing one .
we' re seeing what we choose to see .
let me show you something .
ha !
it' s real .
where is the paint ?
you don' t need it any more .
this is your world now .
thought is real .
physical is the illusion .
ironic , huh ?
where' s god in all this ?
he' s up there .
somewhere ...
shouting down that he loves us .
wondering why we can' t hear him .
you think ?
drink your coffee .
needs milk .
don' t push your luck .
' what do you think , christy ?
' what do you think , christy ?
' right here .
' like this ?
you think ?
' they say we live in our minds anyway .
' having you with me , like this , keeps me happy .
' why do i believe you can hear me ?
' why do i think you can see this ? '
what' s that purple tree ?
i never saw that .
let' s look .
think you can get there in eight seconds ?
eight seconds ?
over there ?
yeah , i just need a little incentive .
yeah ...
i can fly ...
no !
can' t i do what i want ?
i think you' d be more comfortable keeping it real .
think of running fast , like the road runner , ok ?
i can handle this .
adios , muchacho .
oh ...
wait !
chris !
annie !!
i bet you' re thinking " oh , shit ! " now !
aaaaahhhh !
yeah !
go , boy !
go , chris , go !
albert !
albert !
it' s completely new .
the canvas was blank when i was alive .
how can i see this drawing after i' m dead ?
for an expert you look pretty surprised .
you two .
a long courtship ?
no , actually .
from the first moment ...
soulmates .
it' s extremely rare , but it exists .
like twin souls .
tuned in to each other .
apparently , even in death .
you' re reaching each other through her painting .
it' s nothing i' ve ever seen .
' you can' t see it , can you ?
' and you never will . '
i love you !
whose footprints are these ?
don' t ask , you put ' em here .
annie ...
annie !
chris !
fantasy is not what you need .
no , you' re right .
i need annie .
that' il change in time .
oh , come on , einstein !
time' s not on my watch any more !
time does not exist here !
wherever it went , it won' t make me need annie less .
you' il feel differently , and so will she .
man ...
you don' t know us .
wish i did .
marie ...
marie !
look , it' s tigger !
it' s my daughter' s !
katie tore it up once , and ...
she' s here , right ?
where is she ?
here " is big enough for all to have their universe .
that' s not why you haven' t seen them yet , is it ?
what does that mean , buddha ?
i wanna see my children , albert !
when you do , you will .
does that hurt ?
mm mm .
that ?
mm hm .
how about that ?
i' m gonna keep doing this till you tickle .
you' ve got a fever .
it' s going down , though .
don' t you have to go somewhere ?
wanna play chess ?
i could teach you .
would you teach me that ?
excuse me .
albert has to work .
he asked me to meet with you .
will that be all right ?
leona ...
that' s a very beautiful name .
he said you' ve been isolated .
do you wanna see others ?
perhaps a city ?
i would , but travel makes me nauseous .
close your eyes .
i didn' t mean forever .
what do you think ?
i' m a little under dressed .
you look fine .
till now you' ve been painting your world .
this is mine .
in our city across the river we have to have a common vision .
so , there' s work .
mm hm .
i like that .
albert is sort of a missionary .
he saves lost souls .
like me .
hardly .
they are the ones who can' t get here .
you mean , from hell ? .
in a way .
it' s not what you think .
my work is with animals .
katie is an old friend .
' dearest christy .
' i don' t know how this day unravelled .
' i was proud of how i held together through this afternoon .
' but , coming home , i began to lose it .
' if i had walked out that night ,
' you wouldn' t have been in the tunnel .
' a whole family lost in car crashes .
' enough to make a person buy a bike . '
where are they going ?
to help others be reborn .
really ?
reincarnation ?
albert says to cheer you up .
you have difficulty ...
.. losing my wife , yeah .
and your children ?
they died years ago .
that' s why i' m worried about my wife .
they died in a terrible collision .
the nanny was driving .
it wasn' t her fault .
and your wife ?
my daughter had asked her to drive .
it was a trucker' s fault .
but my wife believed that if she' d been driving , her protective instincts would have ...
are you ok ?
come on , katie !
where were you just now ?
your mind' s been wandering all afternoon .
thinking of someone .
your wife must have loved her children very much .
very much .
but you don' t have to break in half to love somebody .
tell me a memory of your own .
say , with your daughter .
hey ...
that' s somebody else' s art .
what' s the difference ?
you weren' t looking anyway .
your move .
is this where we go when we die ?
it' s a dream , baby .
it' s beautiful ,
but you know , dreams ...
.. i know , aren' t real .
it' s after midnight .
i haven' t won yet .
it' s your first time .
no , i like that .
means you' re not cheating .
and when i win , i really win .
i wanna play till i do .
unless you wanna stop .
no .
let' s play till you win .
' she died three months later . '
we played every night .
it meant the world to me .
she never won .
i didn' t look like this in the body , you know .
we flew to singapore once .
and ... .. my daddy smiled at the flight attendant who ...
looked like this and wore this name tag .
he said asian women are so ...
lovely ... and graceful ...
and intelligent .
he didn' t mean only .
i know .
it was something he said .
and i thought , when i grow up , i wanna be that .
you still play chess ?
i think i waited for my partner .
' i swear that california is the strangest place .
' they push you into it
' so you can do it before your shrink commits you .
' thoughtful legislation there .
' mine is suspicious .
' another week , he might commit me .
' for my own safety .
' i had the husband i was meant to have .
' two spectacular children .
' blessings no one would dare expect from life .
' and the truth is , simply ... ' that it' s over .
' just this one loose end to ravel up .
' i didn' t get to say goodbye .
you' re dead and i blew that .
' i don' t get to say goodbye .
' but i' il tell you what
' across whatever distance there is ,
' i send you my love . '
hey .
where were you ?
far away .
i got called back .
i was working .
there are no words to thank you .
for finding marie .
is she ok ?
she' s fine .
you' il see her soon .
she sends her love .
especially now .
we' il go through something very hard right now .
i' m with you .
you' re not alone .
annie is dead .
she killed herself .
it' s nothing i ever expected .
like i said , you don' t know us .
is that an occupational hazard of soulmates ?
one' s not much without the other ?
but she' s ok .
because her pain is over .
you don' t understand .
she won' t cling like me .
when do i see her ?
never .
you' il never see her .
suicides go somewhere else .
why are you punishing her ?
it' s not punishment .
she' s suffered enough .
there are no judges or crimes .
everybody' s equal .
that' s the way things work !
and suicides go to hell ? .
no goddamn judgment in that !
you wanna fight ?
you can hide from it or understand it .
hell " is for those who don' t know they' re dead .
they can' t realise what they' ve done or what' s happened .
too self absorbed that they ...
self absorbed ? !
that doesn' t apply to annie , all right ?
no , it doesn' t .
suicides are different .
they don' t go to hell because they' re immoral or selfish .
there' s a natural order to our journey .
annie has violated that .
she won' t face it .
she won' t realise , accept what she' s done .
she will spend eternity playing that out .
you still say she' s in hell .
everybody' s hell is different .
real hell is your life gone wrong .
i' m her soul mate .
i can find her .
you don' t understand how ...
it' s not about understanding !
it' s about not giving up .
you said there are no rules .
and the tree ?
you were pretty surprised then .
hey , if there are no rules , how can you say all suicides are the same ?
i can' t , i can' t .
ok .
or she doesn' t know she' s dead ?
i can' t .
no one has ever seen a suicide brought back !
stick around , chief .
you ain' t seen nothing yet .
ok .
you deserve your chance .
we' il find a tracker .
hey !
this the guy who doesn' t give up ?
anyone tell you too much persistence can get stupid ?
constantly .
i hear the same thing .
i also hear i read too slow .
i don' t need glasses .
eyes being a figment of my imagination .
you' il hear a lot of smart stuff here .
it' s usually right .
don' t let it screw you up .
i won' t .
your wife love you as strong ?
we' il find her .
but when you find her ... nothing will make her recognise you .
nothing will break her denial .
it' s stronger than her love .
in fact , reinforced by her love .
you can say everything you long to say .
including goodbye .
even if she can' t understand it .
you' il have the satisfaction that you didn' t give up .
that has to be enough .
get me there .
i decide what' s enough .
when do we leave ?
close your eyes .
albert' s a sweet kid .
he is that .
there' s a tenderness i never knew in life .
i didn' t know him when he was young .
were you proud of your own kids ?
of course .
that' s an easy bullshit answer .
think about it .
i said " of course .
i like this sore point .
it' s juice , juice is strong .
it connects .
makes you a better receiver for annie .
she' s the transmitter , sending thoughts of you .
what did you do when alive ?
you mean the last time ?
we can be reborn .
but only if we choose to .
i did the same work ...
you were a shrink !
fairly perceptive .
oh , my god .
you expected physical danger ?
what could it do , kill you ?
no , in hell , there' s real danger .
of losing your mind .
because he' s drowning , that' s why .
he' s 13 years old !
i know .
he needs to hang out with his friends .
veg out in front of the tv , read a fucking book he likes !
he doesn' t wanna let me down ?
no , it' s worse ...
he' s so into you , he feels he' s letting himself down .
he thinks he' s shit .
how sick is that ?
how can you take me out of school ? .
how can you ?
this is my life !
don' t you think i can make it ?
if i really dig in ...
you have to show me more !
come on !
you' re blowing it , ian !
i' m not you !
shipwrecks ...
what is this place ?
the gateway to hell .
how are we doing ?
picking up any signals ?
actually ... not a ripple .
that' s because i was thinking of somebody else .
it' s a slap in the face when you see kids taking a test and they' re breezing through it .
and for you it just ... kinda goes .
every day i see ... how i' m not as good as you and everyone else .
but that doesn' t mean i give up .
hey !
cerberus " the guardian .
how do you feel ? .
more than i want you in and out of school ,
i want to know how you feel at night .
real scared .
i know i believe in you .
if i was going through fucking hell ,
i' d only want one person in the goddamn world with me .
there' s a man ...
ian never got to know .
the man ... he was growing up to be .
he' s a good looking , clear eyed young fella ... .. about 25 .
i can see him .
he' s the type of guy men want to be around .
because he has integrity , you know ?
he has character .
you can' t fake that .
and he' s a guy women want to be around , too .
because there' s tenderness in him .
respect ...
loyalty ...
courage ...
and women respond to that .
makes him a terrific husband .
i see him as a father .
that' s where he really shines .
see , when he looks in his kid' s eyes and the kid knows that his dad really sees him he sees who he is .
then that child knows that he is an amazing person .
he' s quite a guy ... .. that i' il never get to meet .
' i wish i had . '
let' s do it !
come on , she could be in there !
no !
no !
don' t !
don' t ...
don' t do this !
your mother' s not in there , ian !
your mom is not in there , son .
there' s not another man i' d go through hell with .
elevator to hell .
going up .
come on .
so long .
wish us luck .
i' m coming .
i' m not giving you a choice .
what are you saying ?
since you suspected albert was your son ,
you lost your wife' s signal .
i' il concentrate harder !
you' re all mouth and no chops !
all you' re good for is she loves you .
your boy is a distraction .
damn shrinks !
you love shoving people around !
we' re going .
his last chance .
he' s never been in such a place .
you haven' t .
it' s better watching one than two .
you want him clear ?
screw him , ian !
he doesn' t know us !
he' s not family !
no !
i' m not leaving him !
if he never sees her ?
never says goodbye ?
we do it without him .
let' s go !
dad !
no !
listen to me .
when you get there , don' t listen to him .
you find her ... and you bring her back .
you can do it .
i believe in you .
d' you ever think why i chose to be albert ?
he was the only guy you ever listened to .
listen to me now !
think about mom !
think about what happened when we died !
think about what you said to her to bring her back !
' think about mom . '
' think about when we died . '
i' m teaching myself to smoke .
the doctors call it an affirmation of life .
well , it beats the statue thing .
you said " divorce " .
you got my attention .
i think that we' re too different ... .. to stay together .
i mean ...
well , for one thing , why aren' t you in here ?
why didn' t you go crazy ?
your children died .
i remember .
i remember the silence in the house .
i thought i was supposed to be strong .
for me ?
for me .
for us .
just on general principles .
i loved them , annie .
but they' re gone .
you' ve got a choice .
life either goes on ... or not .
and you choose life .
sometimes , when you win , you lose .
this hasn' t been a good day .
c' mon .
it' s our private deck .
i never took more than 30 percent from clients .
this must be it .
mister !
i' m here !
i' m coming !
watch where you' re stepping !
sorry !
excuse me !
anybody got a cure ?
no , man !
excuse me .
sorry .
welcome .
welcome , son .
papa ?
son .
papa ?
you' re close .
welcome .
no .
welcome , welcome .
you' re not my dad , sorry .
it' s all right .
they never come .
don' t worry .
it' s only a matter of time .
you don' t think it looks like a dog ?
you always take the easy ones .
that one looks like a 24 piece dining set .
with a soup tureen .
or a bunny rabbit .
a very complex bunny rabbit .
or a rubenesque breast .
you always think they' re breasts .
all kinds of breasts .
i love them .
yours .
we' il be late for the dance !
what' s the rush ?
i know what you' re doing .
this is all just a stall .
i know why you don' t wanna go .
busted .
why don' t you dance just once ?
other husbands are as clumsy .
oh , thank you .
it' s just that when everybody' s dancing i feel like i' m alone ... .. in a sea of faces .
ahhh !
angel falls ...
it' s a little expensive , yeah .
but it' s our first double d.
shouldn' t it be incredible ?
i' ve never seen anything like it .
that' s my role .
to bring adventure to your life .
you ... taught me ... the only thing i should always remember .
which is ?
i forgot .
oh yeah , oh yeah , oh yeah ...
it was , never give up .
never give up .
never .
she' s here .
you found her .
impressive .
that jolt of fear for her .
it connected .
my god , is that our house ?
it' s like our home .
don' t think that .
it' s an illusion .
the whole place ... her illusion .
suicides can get tortured , committed to punishing themselves .
don' t push her that way .
you want to see her .
tell her what' s in your heart .
and then go .
no pressure .
wait !
i knew you' d find her .
you' re a competitor .
how d' you know the first thing about me ?
you called your son albert .
who is that ?
first doctor i interned under .
he was like a father to me .
his words were gold .
a brilliant mind .
what did he practice before turning to pediatrics ?
child psychia ...
.. psychiatry .
and he was always ... a slow reader .
but these ... used to be rimless .
and the rest of me ... used to be black .
you know why we chose to look different ?
me , the children ?
package doesn' t count ?
one' s as good as ...
no .
the old roles of authority .
who' s the teacher , who' s the father ... gets in the way of who we really are ... to each other .
i' ve waited for years for a chance to watch out for you .
and i' m watching out for you now .
but this isn' t like the rest of hell .
you' ve got no defence against annie .
if losing yourself or being swallowed by hell itself could save her , i' d be there cheering you on .
you' ve got your children back now .
they need you .
three minutes ...
any more , you could lose your mind .
how can you lose your mind ?
once her reality becomes yours , there' s really no way back .
' think about mom . '
' what you said to bring her back . '
hello ?
your door' s open .
sorry , i didn' t mean to scare you .
who ... who are you ?
i' m your neighbour .
i bought the gorman' s place two months ago .
i just moved in .
i never heard they sold their place .
you' re annie nielsen , right ?
they told me a lot about you .
like what ?
what did they say ?
that you' re a very talented artist and ... work for a museum , right ?
and ... you' re a widow .
mrs gorman admires your roses ... very much .
they were so handsome .
but now there' s no water pressure in the neighbourhood .
there' s no electricity and no gas .
there are other things missing , too .
like clean clothes and books i want to read .
and , um ... some of my favourite paintings i have to work on .
aahh !
what is it ?
they' re everywhere now !
i got it !
it' s gone .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
you say your paintings are missing .
some of my most precious panels .
the ones that remind me .
remind me of my husband and my children .
that' s why i never leave .
because they might return ?
i hope that' s true with all my heart .
it' s not , you know .
when you' re dead , you disappear .
my wife committed suicide after our children died .
after i ...
she was the loveliest person .
don' t you think that' s sad ?
don' t you have to leave ?
no .
but if you want me to go ...
i do .
the last day i saw my wife it was our anniversary .
aren' t you leaving ?
in a minute .
i was sticking around in case there was another problem .
it wasn' t a wedding anniversary .
it was a very special kind of day ... .. no one else knows about .
i need to talk to you .
and you don' t have to respond .
this is a one way ticket ... for me .
my hanging around here is not helping you .
and it' s killing me .
today is kind of a d day .
d " for decision , i guess .
about divorce .
that' d be two d' s , wouldn' t it ?
i stand corrected .
look what happens when you don' t say anything for a month .
cindy called .
she said everything is waiting for you .
the artists and curators will see you when you' re better .
and i told her ... it was the museum and one of those meetings that kept you from driving that day .
and if you went back , it' d mean you weren' t sorry , you weren' t wrong and you' d be betraying your children .
she called you crazy and i called her a bitch !
and i hung up !
that didn' t go very well !
what' s true in our minds is true .
whether some people know it or not .
that' s when i realised i' m part of the problem .
not because i remind you .
but because i couldn' t join you .
so i left you alone .
don' t give up , ok ?
ok .
ok .
it' s ok .
so you reconciled .
that' s very romantic .
she still killed herself .
she gave up .
there' s nothing wrong with it .
her husband thought so .
he was a coward !
being strong , not giving up ... that was his place to hide .
he pushed away the pain so hard , he disconnected himself from the person he loved the most .
sometimes , when you win , you lose .
when he saw his children again ...
i thought your children were dead .
you can see the dead .
in your dreams .
if you want to .
i wanna see christy .
i can show you .
it' s not hard .
all you have to do ... it' s like painting a picture .
we do it together .
just close your eyes .
remember where you were married ?
christy !
christy ...
who else would you be marrying in your dreams ?
i missed you .
annie ...
this is real .
the man in the garden .
it' s me .
no !
no !
whoever you are , did you think you could take him from me ?
i' m sorry , babe .
there' s some things i have to say .
i' ve only got a few moments left .
i' m sorry for all the things i' il never give you .
i' il never buy you another meatball sub with extra sauce .
and always the big one .
i' il never make you smile .
i just wanted us to be old together .
two old farts laughing at each other as our bodies fell apart .
together at the end .
by that lake in your painting .
that was our heaven , see ?
there' s lots of things to miss .
books ... naps ... kisses ... and fights .
oh , god , we had some great ones !
thank you for every kindness .
thank you for our children .
for the first time i saw them .
thank you for being someone i was always proud to be with .
for your guts , for your sweetness .
for how you always looked , for how i always wanted to touch you .
god , you were my life .
i apologise for every time i failed you .
especially this one .
didn' t you think i' d make it ?
you were in there a while .
took me a while to realise you were right .
nothing you can do could help her .
this trip was for you .
did you come close ...
.. to losing it ?
oh , yeah .
pushed it right to the edge .
that' s why i had to come out now .
i' m giving up .
not the way you think .
go home , al .
will you tell my children i love them ?
and i won' t leave their mother .
where are we headed ?
in one minute i won' t know you any better than you' il know me .
but we' il be together .
where we belong .
good people go to hell because they can' t forgive themselves .
i know i can' t .
but i can forgive you .
for killing my children ?
and my sweet husband ?
for being so wonderful , a guy would choose hell over heaven , just to hang around you .
not because i remind you ... but because i couldn' t join you .
sorry i left you alone .
don' t give up , ok ?
christy ?
christy .
what happened to this place ?
it' s cold .
christy ?
god , no !
no , no , no , no !
don' t give up !
don' t give up !
christy !
don' t give up !
don' t , don' t give up !
christy !
stay with me , don' t give up ...
christy !
hey !
remember me ?
sometimes , when you lose ... you win .
how did we get here ?
travel here is like everything else .
it' s in your mind .
you only have to close your eyes .
if you know where you' re going ...
looks like we did .
where you were ...
i tried everything .
nothing worked .
until ... you tried trailing me .
what some folks call impossible ... is what they haven' t seen before .
excuse me , lady .
ready for that surprise i promised ?
yeah .
that' s not the surprise !
mommy ?
i want us to grow old together .
can we do that here ?
mm hm .
i want it all .
as long as it' s with you .
it will be .
but what about going back ?
being reborn ?
that' s the one thing we can' t have here .
finding each other all over again .
falling in love .
make different choices .
try again .
yeah .
avoid sharp objects .
don' t worry about the kids .
they' il be here .
they want us to go .
a human life is just a heartbeat here .
and we' il all be together .
forever .
how will i find you ?
i found you in hell .
i' il find you in jersey .
' when i was young ...
i met this beautiful girl by a lake . '
# we follow the river
# we follow the river
# down into the stream
# that' s where my dream began
# i left my worries
# to the people who stare
# and dreamed without a care
# that i' d always be beside you
# to watch the day and night
# and we' il listen to the sunrise
# and feel its glowing light
# and peace will come inside
# so quiet
# wherever we' re going
# i don' t know
# for a million years our love keeps growin '
# the mystery deepens
# day by day
# but trust my love and hear me say
# that i' il always be beside you
# to watch the day and night
# and we' il listen to the sunrise
# and feel it' s glowing light
# and peace will come inside
# so quiet
# peace will come inside
# so quiet
# yes , i' il always be beside you
# to watch the day and night
# and we' il listen to the sunrise
# and feel its glowing light
# and peace will come inside
# so quiet
# yes , peace will come inside
# so quiet #
