mother !
what is it , dear ?
what' s the matter ?
oh !
al malone , the deputy , just called .
he wants me over at the fawcett place .
some detectives from santa rosa will be there .
will you be alright ?
yes .
i was just taking your mother in some tea .
oh , be careful , please .
and you be careful .
mitch ?
no , it' s me , mrs brenner .
i thought you might like some tea .
oh .
thank you .
where' s mitch ?
al malone wanted him
at the fawcett farm .
why ?
didn' t al believe my story ?
he was calling from the farm .
then he saw .
oh , he must have .
they sent for the santa rosa police .
what good will they do ?
do you think cathy' s alright at the school ?
yes , i' m sure she' s fine .
do i sound very foolish to you ?
oh , no .
i keep seeing dan' s face .
and they have such big windows at the school .
all the windows are broken in dan' s bedroom .
try not to think about that .
i wish i were a stronger person .
i lost my husband four years ago , you know .
it' s terrible how you depend on someone else for strength , and then ... suddenly all the strength is gone , and you' re alone .
i' d love to be able to relax sometime .
i' d love to be able to sleep .
do you think cathy' s alright ?
annie' s there .
she' il be alright .
i' m not like this , you know ?
not usually .
i don' t fuss and fret about my children .
when frank died ...
you see , he understood the children .
he really understood them .
he had the knack of entering into their world , of becoming part of them .
that' s a very rare talent .
yes .
oh , i wish , i wish , i wish i could be like that .
i miss him .
sometimes , even now , i wake up in the morning and i think , " i must get frank' s breakfast .
and i get up , and there' s a very good reason for getting out of bed , until , of course , i remember .
i miss talking to him .
cathy' s a child , of course , and mitch ...
well , mitch has his own life .
i' m glad he stayed here today .
i feel safer with him here .
would you like to rest now ?
no .
no , don' t go .
i feel as if i don' t understand you at all , and i want so much to understand .
why , mrs brenner ?
because my son seems to be very fond of you .
and i don' t quite know how i feel about it .
i don' t even know if i like you or not .
is that so important , your liking me ?
well , yes .
i think so .
mitch is important to me .
i want to like whatever girl he chooses .
and perhaps if you don' t ?
well , then i don' t think it' il matter much to anyone but me .
i think it would also matter to mitch .
mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do .
but , you see ...
i don' t want to be left alone .
i don' t think i could bear to be left alone !
oh , forgive me .
oh , forgive me .
this business with the birds has upset me .
i don' t know what i' d do if mitch weren' t here .
why don' t you try to sleep now , mrs brenner ?
i wish i were stronger .
do you think she' s alright ?
do you think she' s alright at the school ?
would you like me to go for her ?
oh , i couldn' t ask it .
oh , i don' t mind , really .
would you ?
i' d feel so much better .
i' il go right now .
melanie ?
thanks for the tea .

now , please put your songbooks away , then stand up alongside your desks .
we' il go out for recess as soon as everybody gets ready .
we are not going into the playground
until everybody has quieted down .
close that door .
quickly .
what ?
please .
what is it ?
look .
we' ve got to get the children out of here .
shh , shh , shh !
alright , children .
now , quiet .
miss daniels would like to see how we conduct ourselves
during a fire drill .
i would like you to show her how quiet and obedient you can be .
uh , we' re going out of school now .
leave school ?
we want those of you who live nearby to go directly home .
home ?
i want the rest of you to go all the way down to the hotel .
is that clear ?
yes , miss hayworth .
melanie ?
i want you to go as quietly as possible .
don' t make a sound till i tell you to run .
then run as quickly as you can .
now , does everybody understand ?
yes , miss hayworth .
alright , john , you lead the way .
cathy !
cathy !
( crying .
birds squawking )
daddy , there were hundreds of them .
no , i' m not hysterical .
i' m trying to tell you this as calmly as i know how .
alright , daddy .
yes , daddy .
well , just now .
not 15 minutes ago .
at the school .
no , i don' t .
just a minute .
what' s the name of the school ?
just the bodega bay school .
the bodega bay school .
well , i don' t know how many children 30 or 40 .
no , the birds didn' t attack until the children were outside the school .
help you , mrs bundy ?
i need some change , mr carter .
crows , i think .
i don' t know .
is there a difference between crows and blackbirds ?
there is very definitely a difference .
thank you .
they' re different , daddy .
well , i think these were crows .
well , yes .
hundreds of them .
yes , they attacked the children .
attacked them !
well , i don' t know when , but i simply can' t leave now , daddy .
alright .
yes .
good bye .
they' re both perching birds , of course .
but quite different species .
the crow is corvus brachyrhynchos , and the blackbird is euphagus cyanocephalos .
thank you .
you have the number at the fawcett farm ?
right here in this book , miss .
i can' t see that it makes any difference , mrs bundy .
crows or blackbirds , if the school was attacked , that' s pretty serious .
i hardly think that either species would have sufficient intelligence to launch a massed attack .
their brainpans are not big enough to ...
i just came from the school .
i don' t know anything about their brainpans , but ...
well , i do .
i do know .
ornithology happens to be my avocation .
birds are not aggressive creatures , miss .
they bring beauty into the world .
it is mankind , rather , who  sam !
three southern fried chicken .
baked potato on all of them .
yes , may i speak to mitch brenner , please ?
yes , i' il wait .
it is mankind , rather , who insists upon making it difficult for life to exist upon this planet .
now , if it were not for birds  mrs bundy , you don' t understand .
this young lady said there was an attack on the school .
impossible !
oh , mitch ?
i' m glad i caught you .
something terrible has happened .
it' s the end of the world .
two bloody marys , deke .
what actually happened at the school ?
bunch of crows attacked the school kids .
it' s the end of the world .
thus saith the lord god unto the mountains and the hills , and the rivers and the valleys .
behold i , even i shall bring a sword upon you .
and i will devastate your high places .
ezekiel , chapter six .
" woe unto them that rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink .
isaiah , chapter five .
it' s the end of the world .
i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world .
these weren' t a few birds .
i didn' t know there were many crows in bodega bay this time of year .
the crow is a permanent resident throughout its range .
in fact , during our christmas count , we recorded  how many gulls did you count , mrs bundy ?
which gulls , mr sholes ?
there are several varieties .
the ones who' ve been playing devil with my fishing boats .
have you had trouble with gulls ?
one of my boats did , last week .
this young lady was hit by a gull only saturday .
i' m still waiting for the bloody marys .
coming right up .
could you ask them to lower their voices , please ?
they' re frightening the children .
a whole flock of gulls nearly capsized one of my boats .
practically tore the skipper' s arm off .
you' re scaring the kids .
keep it low .
alright .
yeah , but he' s scaring me , too .
are you trying to say that all these ...
nah , that sounds impossible , sebastian .
deke , look , i' m just telling you what happened to one of my boats .
the gulls were after your fish .
really , let' s be logical about this .
what were the crows after at the school ?
what do you think they were after , miss uh ... ?
daniels .
i think they were after the children .
for what purpose ?
to kill them .
why ?
i don' t know why .
i thought not .
birds have been on this planet , miss daniels ,
since archaeopteryx , 140m years ago .
doesn' t it seem odd that they' d wait all that time to start a war against humanity ?
no one called it a war .
scotch , light on the water .
you and mr sholes seem to be implying as much .
who said anything about a war ?
all i said , some gulls
want some more coffee ?
no ... came down on one of my boats .
they could have been after the fish , just like you said .
the captain should have shot at them .
huh ?
gulls are scavengers , anyway .
most birds are .
get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth !
that would hardly be possible .
why not , mrs bundy ?
because there are 8, 650 species of birds in the world today , mr carter .
it is estimated that 5, 750, 000, 000 birds live in the united states alone .
the five continents of the world
kill them all .
get rid of the messy animals . ... probably contain more than 100 billion birds .
it' s the end of the world .
the gulls must have been after the fish .
of course !
hurry up , children .
finish your lunch .
are the birds going to eat us , mommy ?
hell , maybe we' re all getting a little carried away by this .
admittedly , a few birds did act strange , but that' s no reason to believe that
i keep telling you , this isn' t a few birds .
these are gulls , crows , swifts
i have never known birds of different species to flock together .
the very concept is unimaginable .
why , if that happened , we wouldn' t have a chance !
how could we possibly hope to fight them ?
we couldn' t , you' re right .
you' re right , mrs bundy .
what' s the matter ?
something wrong ?
we' re fighting a war .
a war ?
against who ?
against birds !
i' m glad you all think this is so amusing .
you' ve frightened the children half out of their wits .
if the young lady said she saw the attack at a school , why don' t you believe her ?
what attack ?
who attacked the school ?
birds did .
crows .
you' re all sitting around here debating !
what do you want them to do next ?
crash through that window ?
mommy !
ssh .
put on your coat .
why don' t you all go home , lock your doors and windows ?
what' s the fastest way to san francisco ?
the freeway , ma' am .
how do i find it ?
i' m going out that way , lady .
you can follow me .
well then , let' s leave now .
haven' t finished my drink yet .
i got here as fast as i could .
where' s cathy ?
she' s with annie .
she' s alright .
al , why aren' t you over at the school , where the attack was ?
i just got back from dan fawcett' s place .
he was killed last night by birds .
what ?
hold it , you don' t know that for a fact .
what are the facts ?
the santa rosa police think it' s a felony murder .
they think a burglar broke in and killed him .
how do they explain the dead birds all over the floor ?
santa rosa police figure they got in after the old man was killed .
were the santa rosa police at your school today ?
are you coming ?
now take it easy , lady .
there isn' t a bird anywhere in sight !
look at the birds of the air .
they do not sow or reap .
yet your heavenly father feeds them .
something like this happened in santa cruz last year .
the town was just covered with seagulls .
please finish your drink .
that' s right , sir .
i recall it .
a large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog , and headed into the town where all the lights were .
they made some mess , too , smashing into buildings and everything .
they always make a mess .
the point is that no one seemed to be upset about it .
they were all gone next morning , just as though nothing at all had happened .
poor things .
i' m leaving !
are you coming ?
alright , alright !
well , hope you folks figure this thing out !
it' s the end of the world !
i' d better get back to the cannery .
what do i owe you , deke ?
sebastian , hold it a minute .
huh ?
i don' t want to be an alarmist , but  no one ever said you were .
i think we' re in real trouble .
i don' t know how this started , or why , but i know it' s here and we' d be crazy to ignore it .
to ignore what ?
the " bird war " ?
yes , the " bird war .
the bird attack , plague call it what you like , they' re massing out there someplace , and they' il be back .
ridiculous .
come here .
unless we do something right now , unless we get bodega bay on the move , they
look , mitch .
even if this is true , even if all the birds
don' t you believe it' s true ?
no , mitch , frankly i don' t .
there' s no reason i ...
it' s happening .
isn' t that a reason ?
i like bodega bay  then help me !
you' re an important man .
if you help , they all will .
help how ?
what do you want to do ?
mrs bundy said something about santa cruz .
about seagulls getting lost in a fog and flying in towards the lights .
we don' t have fog this time of year !
make our own fog !
how do you figure to do that ?
we can use smoke pots , the way the army uses them .
look !
they' re attacking again .
melanie , you stay in here .
come on , al !
look out !
look at the gas .
that man' s lighting a cigar !
hey , you !
watch out !
don' t drop that match !
get out of there !
mister , run !
( shrieking .
gulls crying , fainter )
why are they doing this ?
why are they doing this ?
they said when you got here , the whole thing started !
who are you ?
what are you ?
where did you come from ?
i think you' re the cause of all this .
i think you' re evil !
evil !
oh , god !
( woman sobbing .
door opens & closes )
i think they' re going !
we can get cathy at annie' s now .
the crows again .
shh !
come on .
oh , no .
stay here .
stay here .
cathy !
where' s cathy ?
( cawing .
cathy sobbing )
mitch , don' t !
oh , don' t leave her there , mitch .
oh !
( cawing .
door opening & closing )
come on .
shh .
when we got back from taking michelle home , we heard the explosion and we went we went outside to see what it was .
all at once , the birds were everywhere !
all at once she pushed me inside and they covered her !
annie ... she pushed me inside !
give me another one , darling .
how long have they been gathering there ?
oh , about 15 minutes .
seems like a pattern , doesn' t it ?
they strike , then disappear , and then start massing again .
doesn' t look so very different , does it ?
a little smoke hanging over the town , otherwise ...
you want to try your father again ?
no , i tried a little while ago .
the phone' s dead .
still got power , haven' t we ?
yes .
mitch , i' m getting something on the radio .
come on .
i can' t get any of the local stations .
i think this is san francisco .
" ... and the work of a team of professionals .
in bodega bay early this morning , a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill .
one little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in santa rosa , but the majority of children reached safety .
we understand there was another attack on the town , but this information is rather sketchy .
so far , no word has come through to show there have been further attacks .
on the national scene today , in washington
well , is that all ?
i' il have to get some more wood .
mustn' t let this fire go out .
did you get the windows in the attic ?
yes , i got them all .
when do you think they' il come ?
i don' t know .
if there are bigger birds , mitch , they' il get into the house .
it' s a chance we' il have to take .
maybe we ought to leave .
no , not now !
not when they' re massing out there .
when ?
we' il just see what happens .
where will we go ?
i don' t know .
i think we' re safe here for the time being .
let' s get the wood .
what happens when you run out of wood ?
i don' t know !
we' il break up the furniture .
you don' t know !
when will you know ?
when we' re all dead !
if only your father were here ...
( radio continues .
sobbing )
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , mitch .
make yourself some coffee , won' t you ?
where are they heading ?
somewhere inland .
santa rosa ?
maybe .
come on .
let' s get the wood .
mitch ?
can i bring the lovebirds in here ?
no !
but , mom , they' re in a cage .
they' re birds , aren' t they ?
let' s leave them in the kitchen , huh , honey ?
mitch , why are they doing this , the birds ?
we don' t know , honey .
why are they trying to kill people ?
i wish i could say .
i' m sick , melanie .
i want to ...  i' il go with you .
( door slams .
cathy coughing )
( flapping grows louder .
high pitched chirping )
( shutter scraping shut .
screeching continues )
( pecking , splintering .
continuous screeching )
they' re going .
mitch ?
( gasps .
wings flapping )
oh , mitch !
get cathy and lydia out of here .
melanie !
melanie !
oh , poor thing !
poor thing !
listen , get some water , bandages and antiseptic .
quickly !
bandages .
it' s terrible .
cathy , get some brandy .
no , no , no !
no , no , it' s alright .
no , it' s alright .
it' s alright .
it' s alright .
no .
no .
shh !
shh !
cathy , get the lamp .
we' ve got to get her to a hospital .
we can' t .
there' s no place we can go .
there' s san francisco .
we' d never make it .
we have to try .
we' il go by way of bay hill road .
then we don' t have to go through town .
we can' t stay here .
she needs help !
i' m frightened .
terribly frightened .
i don' t know what' s outside there .
we' d better get started before another attack comes .
we' il take melanie' s car .
that' il be faster than the truck .
can you finish the bandaging ?
i' il try .
alright .
mitch ?
see if you can get anything on the car radio .
" the bird attacks have subsided for the time being .
' bodega bay seems to be the centre , though there are reports of minor attacks on sebastopol and a few on santa rosa .
' bodega bay has been cordoned off by roadblocks .
most of the townspeople have managed to get out , but there are still some isolated pockets of people .
no decision has been arrived at yet as to what the next step will be , but there' s been some discussion as to whether the military should go in .
it appears that the bird attacks come in waves , with long intervals between .
the reason for this does not seem clear as yet .
did you hear anything on the radio ?
it' s alright .
come on .
no .
no !
shh .
shh .
mitch ?
shh !
stay there .
can i bring the lovebirds , mitch ?
they haven' t harmed anyone .
alright .
bring them .
