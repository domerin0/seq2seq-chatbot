before i start signing these ,
i need to thank somebody who' s here tonight .
when i had her at state that didn' t sound right .
i never had her .
i wanted her , but never had her .
what i meant was when i took her class .
i had the worst case of writer' s block in the world .
all i had were terrible ideas .
i hated them all .
i was just about to drop the class when she said something to me that changed everything .
she said , " terrible ideas are like playground scapegoats .
given the right encouragement , they grow up to be geniuses .
she told me to take one , and work on it .
well , i did .
frances mayes , who loves terrible ideas , may i please french kiss you now ?
go for it , willie boy !
married , william .
sorry .
proud of me ?
ridiculously .
frances , these are amazing .
what did you do ?
chocolate is timing , my friend .
the rest is magic .
hey , professor .
where is the wine ?
over there .
tom is one lucky bastard .
a literary wife who makes brownies .
i swear , if you tell me you cook in the nude ,
i' il go home and kill myself .
never in the nude .
always in a thong .
actually , if you knew frances , you' d know these are avoidance .
thanks .
how' s the novel going ?
not so well .
but the procrastination is coming along fabulously .
soon it will breed abject self loathing , and then i' il just become a writing machine .
what about tom ?
how' s his book going ?
fine .
he' s home writing right now .
you know tom ?
i met him recently , sort of by coincidence .
the other coincidence is that you reviewed a book of mine .
i did ?
did i like it ?
you didn' t .
well , i' m sorry .
i' m sure there were a lot of other critics who loved it .
and i really hope you didn' t take it personally .
you called my lead character " unrealistic .
i think bad reviews should just be forgotten .
give him a brownie .
i would like to give you this .
it comes in peace .
you said you just couldn' t get interested in a novel where the protagonist was a guy who spent all of his time living out his horny teenage fantasies .
i just find that ironic .
ironic .
why ?
ask your husband .
what did he just say ?
frances ?
frances ?
i' ve got some unfortunate news for you .
i just got off the phone with your husband' s attorney , and they' re going to pursue alimony .
how can we be talking about alimony when i hardly make enough money ?
but you supported him during the marriage .
yes .
but while he was researching and writing his book ,
i worked while he pretended to be ...
unfortunately , this is just about the math .
he was having an affair .
california' s a no fault state .
his attorney indicated your husband would prefer an alimony buy out .
since you two were living rather modestly ,
i don' t think the number should be too bad .
they' re probably talking about something like $200, 000 .
i don' t have that money .
unfortunately , you do .
the house ?
its value went through the roof since you bought it .
and renovated it with my mother' s money .
well , it' s all community property now .
so he gets half the house and alimony .
there' s leeway , and we' il make all the arguments we can .
but there is a bargaining chip .
he wants the house .
he wants to keep living there ?
yeah .
and if you let him have it , you could end up with a lot of money in your pocket .
i understand he wants it pretty badly .
i' m sorry .
this is so surreal .
how would he even find the money to buy me out of my half ?
oh .
oh .
wow .
apparently , she likes the place .
it' s near the right schools .
schools ?
she' s ...
you' re gonna get over this .
you will , frances .
someday , you' re gonna be happy again .
right .
and the desk ?
the desk goes .
no , the desk can stay .
the couch ?
yes , please .
wait a minute .
no , the sofas can stay .
how about the chairs ?
they stay , too .
actually , everything' s going to stay except those boxes .
those boxes with the books in them .
if you don' t mind .
you' re sure ?
yeah .
the bedroom ?
nope .
kitchen ?
no .
so then we' re done .
we' re done .
you getting a divorce ?
it shows ?
these are furnished , short term apartments .
that' s who we get .
your neighbor in 2 b.
he' s an attorney .
his divorce has been dragging on for three years .
nice guy .
gives free legal advice to the other tenants .
if his crying gets on your nerves , just bang on the wall .
he' il stop .
sorry .
guy above you is a doctor .
he hands out the sleeping pills .
what do you do ?
i' m a writer .
so you can help the others with their suicide notes .
wow .
you' re one of those funny landlords .
not really .
well , here' s your keys .
have a good stay .
thanks .
home .
ta da !
you start a marriage with cake and champagne .
finish it that way , too .
the beginning and the end should be fun , fun , fun .
too bad about those years in the middle .
sorry .
make a wish .
things got crazy at the hospital .
hi .
you made it in time for the toast .
bravo .
and it only took a year .
to freedom .
to freedom .
thanks .
you' re not drinking .
you' re not drinking .
fifth time was a charm .
oh , my god !
patti !
when are you due ?
may .
may !
oh , my god !
i' m going to be an auntie !
i' m going to be an auntie .
yes .
it changes our plans a bit .
well , of course .
we were about to take a 10 day tour to romantic tuscany .
but i don' t want patti flying .
small sacrifice .
we decided to change our coach tickets into an upgraded ticket for you .
oh .
this is amazing .
really generous .
thank you , but no .
how can you say no to tuscany ?
no .
like that .
that' s your depression speaking .
it doesn' t speak ltalian .
it speaks high school french .
besides , i' m not depressed anymore .
then what are you still doing living with those losers ?
those are my people .
that' s not a place you live .
guys , come on .
thank you so much .
but there is no way i can go on a romantic tour of tuscany .
i' m not ready to meet anyone .
you won' t .
we can assure you .
oh ?
it' s a gay tour of romantic tuscany .
so it would be very relaxing for you .
you know , mostly couples .
no one would be there to hit on you .
and you could concentrate and listen to your own inner voice .
my inner voice ?
my inner voice that would be saying ,
what am i doing on a gay tour of tuscany ?
frances , it' s ltaly !
italy .
plus , you could use it as a time to start writing .
well , i' m busy .
i have to review all those books .
instead of working on your own book .
wow .
are you being mean or just hormonal ?
okay .
don' t kill each other until i get back .
can we please just talk about the baby ?
i think you' re in danger .
of ?
of never recovering .
you know when you come across one of those empty shell people ?
and you think , " what the hell happened to you ?
well , there came a time in each one of those lives where they were at a crossroads .
crossroads .
god , that is so " oprah .
someplace where they had to decide to turn left or right .
this is no time to be a chickenshit , frances .
i' m not being a chickenshit .
i' m not .
okay , promise me you' il think about it .
i' il think about it .
okay .
i got a feeling about you .
are you looking for a place ?
yeah , i guess .
you getting a divorce ?
what ?
we got short term apartments .
but don' t worry .
some stay for years .
we got a writer .
we got a doctor .
the doctor could help you straighten out your life .
hey !
sorry .
it' s okay .
do you want to come over ?
no !
maybe later .
maybe later .
oh !
hello ?
patti , when do i leave ?
hi , i' m david .
this is your driver , eduardo .
and you are " gay & away " !
and welcome to your first day of a romantic tour of tuscany .
now , i saw most of you getting to know each other on the plane .
but i wanted to make sure you' ve all met frances .
hey , frances .
now , frances is straight .
oh , poor girl .
and she just survived a terrible divorce .
and according to her friend patti , she needs our support .
so , frances , why don' t you stand up , and let everyone say hello ?
no .
come on .
hi !
you' re the bachelor , frances .
have some fun !
okay , everyone , follow the flower .
good god , i cannot believe it is raining .
okay , everyone , we' re here !
yeah !
okay !
oops .
sorry .
you' re empty .
you need a little more ?
whoo !
you want more wine ?
little more vino ?
excuse me .
can a black gal get a drink ?
yes , she can .
frances , little more ?
mm hmm .
you' ve got to loosen up , honey .
we having a party !
buongiorno , [ speaking ltalian ]
si ,
what ?
pretty awesome , isn' t it ?
yes , i think you could say that .
pretty awesome .
god , how am i gonna get through all of these ?
i mean , how do you begin to describe all of this ?
if you have a pen , i could write it for you .
are you a good writer ?
i used to be .
all right .
well , have a go .
to my mom .
dear mom .
frances ; dear mom ,
it' s market day in cortona ,
the piazza is an ongoing party , and everyone is invited ,
cliches converge at this navel of the world ,
you almost want to laugh , but you can' t help feeling these italians know more about having fun than we do ,
i eat a hot grape from the market , and the violet sweetness breaks open in my mouth ,
it even smells purple ,
i wish i could stay longer , but the bell reminds me of time ,
ding dang dong , " the bell says , instead of " ding dong ,
i wish you were here , love ...
rodney .
thanks .
it even smells like purple " ?
my mom will never believe i wrote this .
keep it .
ding dang dong goes the bell .
i' m sorry .
bramasole .
bramasole .
it' s a nice little villa .
rather run down , but redeemable .
are you going to buy it ?
no , no , no .
i' m just a tourist here for the day .
so ?
well , who wouldn' t want to buy a villa in tuscany ?
but the way my life' s been going that would be a terrible idea .
a terrible idea .
mm hmm .
don' t you just love those ?
sorry , everybody .
unscheduled stop .
look at the sheep .
oh , my gosh .
stop the bus !
stop the bus !
hello ?
hello ?
shit .
oh , excuse me .
oh , i' m sorry .
can i help you , signora ?
yes , i thought the house was for sale .
oh , no .
the house is for sale .
but , unfortunately , someone' s already buying it .
we like it very much , and we' il buy it today .
very good .
one moment please .
excuse me .
they want it .
they agree on the price .
so soon ?
then we asked too little .
ask for 20 million lire more , at least .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m afraid that there has been a change in the price .
it is now 20 million lire more expensive .
why ?
it didn' t get more valuable in five minutes .
the contessa feels she has asked too little since you agreed to buy it .
that logic is absurd .
excuse me ?
what is the price ?
are you bidding against us ?
wait .
we accept the new price .
no , this is a beautiful house .
and whoever wants it has to pay double .
the contessa says that since there is so much interest in the house , the price is now double .
since the last 10 seconds ?
normale ,
you greedy americans .
you think you' re so entitled .
you ruin everything .
a lot of us feel really badly about that .
we' re going .
we' il look in provence .
fascists !
and her ?
how much will she pay ?
we' il see .
is it really double the price ?
i can' t pay double the price .
but please tell the contessa that this is what i got for my house recently in dollars .
minus the work on the place .
hammers , buckets .
men .
chocolate .
and a rental car to drive off a cliff when this all turns out to have been a terrible mistake .
that' s what i can pay .
signora ,
you' ve not even seen the house .
oh .
well .
well , i ...
i can' t go back to san francisco .
no .
no .
i' m sorry , signora ,
the contessa' s family lived here for generations , so understandably it is very difficult for her to sell .
money is not the only issue .
she needs [ speaking ltalian ]
a sign .
i understand .
i believe in signs , too .
well , thank you .
thank you .
oh !
oh .
oh .
please .
what did she say ?
in ltaly , what happened to you is a very good sign .
it is ?
yes .
and now ... would you like to see the house ?
first , we open an account .
then you transfer the money .
here is the legal description .
two oxen , two days .
i' m sorry .
it' s old fashioned .
the land is measured by how long it would take two oxen to plow it .
oh .
oh , that makes sense .
just like that ?
before the money' s been transferred ?
it' s a house , not a vespa .
what are you going to do , steal it ?
besides , signor martini likes you .
okay .
we' il take care of the rest later .
normale ,
normale ?
normale ,
normale ,
frances ; i have bought a house in a foreign country ,
a house and the land it takes two oxen two days to plow ,
not having a plow or an ox ,
i' il have to take their word on that ,
buyer' s remorse is a very common affliction among new homeowners ,
just because you have a sudden urge to weep , that doesn' t mean you' ve made a mistake ,
everybody knows old houses have their quirks ,
especially 300 year old houses ,
i have inherited 10, 000 empty wine bottles , one grape , every issue of " la nazione " printed in 1958 , and assorted previous tenants ,
ugh !
the trick to overcoming buyer' s remorse is to have a plan ,
pick one room and make it yours ,
go slowly through the house ,
be polite , introduce yourself , so it can introduce itself to you ,
you did what ?
frances bought a house in tuscany !
and you' re gonna live there alone ?
well , i' m not there alone .
i' m there with bugs .
how' s the belly ?
it' s growing .
i can' t believe you did this .
did you already sign ?
yes .
why ?
what ?
you think i shouldn' t have ?
are you telling me i made a mistake ?
i don' t know .
did you ?
well , i don' t know .
you' re the one who made the " empty shell person " speech .
oh , yeah .
that was me .
okay .
wow !
you bought a villa in tuscany !
so , what' s the place like ?
it needs a little work .
well , who' s gonna do it ?
i am .
you are ?
i never realized you were so handy .
i can do things .
remember , i fixed that drain ?
the drain in your kitchen ?
no , that was me .
i handed you the rubber thingy .
the plunger ?
that was tom .
i can' t believe it .
why did you just say his name ?
i' m sorry .
i forgot .
i' m sorry .
i can make this work .
you know ?
of course i didn' t mean i was gonna do all the work myself .
i can hire the descendents of roman gods to do the heavy lifting .
then , just supervise , tell them what to do .
so , have you met him yet ?
who ?
the guy you' re gonna meet .
patti , please .
you know what ?
it' s starting to rain here a little bit .
so i think i have to go now .
wait , fran .
i want you to kiss the belly for me .
fran .
bye bye .
can you star 69 ltaly ?
no .
i' m gonna try .
hello ?
okay .
one 1, 000 ,
2 aah !
jesus !
okay .
stop it .
stop it .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
you' re gonna be okay .
you' re safe here .
just don' t fly around , okay ?
you' il freak me out .
oh , god .
signora ?
signora mayes ?
buongiorno ,
i see you have survived the storm .
i' m alive .
but the washing machine is dead .
yes .
it was electrocuted .
i' m happy to see that you were not .
you came to check on me ?
you' re meeting the contractors today , and i came to help you .
i believe one of them is here .
here ?
downstairs .
oh .
oh , yeah .
he' s here .
i was hoping to take this wall down and return these two small rooms into one big room .
oh , wonderful .
you should have been an architect .
you have excellent taste .
so , do you think it can be done ?
hidden pipes , a week .
the bathrooms , 3 days .
signora , give me the keys of this place , and in one month , i will give you the keys to your palace .
just ...
just leave it to me .
boom !
boom !
boom !
oh .
oh !
he says he fixed it himself many years ago .
really ?
oh .
you want to see the rest of the house ?
okay .
yes , yes .
he suggest that he rebuild the wall .
it is important for the structure of the garden .
he has a team of experts .
buongiorno ,
hello , miss .
we are not ltalian .
we are from polonia ,
poland .
oh .
do you all speak english ?
only me .
and only a little .
i am pawel .
oh , pawel .
nice to meet you .
buongiorno ,
jerzy .
jerzy .
hello .
zbignew .
zbignew .
frances .
what do you think of nino ?
i know his mother .
if he does a bad job , he' s ...
well , then .
okay .
yes .
okay .
yes .
yes , yes .
okay .
yes .
see , frances ?
no problem .
nino !
oh , god !
run !
oh !
aah !
okay .
yes .
kurwa mac !
kurwa mac " means " holy shit " in polish ,
i learned that that day ,
the fact i' m trying to speak polish in italy is just one of the many surprises around here ,
is he a licensed electrician ?
no .
he' s a licensed literature professor .
oh .
czeslaw milosz .
i like him .
czeslaw milosz .
it is only natural getting to know people should take time ,
every day i watch for the old man with the flowers ,
and i wonder , was he born here ?
did he love someone here ?
did he lose someone here ?
he doesn' t seem as curious about me , but that' s all right ,
these days , i' m something of a loner myself ,
i' m pretty good at staying entertained ,
mostly , i like to hang out at a bar i know conveniently located in my backyard ,
fortunately , there are things here you can' t do alone ,
it' s my neighbor placido who' s teaching me about olives ,
t oday is okay .
but never pick when it' s wet , huh ?
okay .
these look good .
oh , my god .
papa !
si ?
i' m finished .
good .
gather up the net .
okay .
chiara !
si ?
go and see if gianni needs some help .
okay .
go , go .
ciao ,
oops !
everything okay ?
si ,
grazie ,
francesca ?
are you busy tonight ?
no .
then come to dinner .
it' s unhealthy to eat alone .
stop it , mom .
it' s embarrassing .
ls she okay ?
of course .
she' s fine .
mama , that' s enough .
my granny' s very sensitive .
she cries all day .
are we celebrating something in particular ?
gratitude to the saints for saving us from droughts , mad dogs , and glandular disorders .
good evening , everybody .
sorry i' m late .
katherine !
hand me your hat .
do you like it ?
i suppose it wasn' t a terrible idea , buying a villa .
are you up there all alone ?
no lord and master , no consort ?
no .
do you have one ?
one ?
ha !
i knew this would happen .
remember ?
don' t blame me .
i told him not to get her that computer .
she got an e mail lover , you see , from ecuador .
finally , she had to tell him her age .
no mail !
you had it coming .
you' re wrong .
i hurt in my heart .
even though i' m old , my heart still aches .
i' m so sorry .
l' amore , si , [ speaks ltalian ]
si ,
hmm ?
celibe ?
celibe ,
celibate ?
celibate !
si ,
no .
i mean ...
well , actually , i have to admit it has been a while .
celibe " in ltalian means " single .
he' s not asking when you last had sex .
he' s asking whether or not you' re married .
thank you .
no , i' m not .
everything all right , darling ?
oh , terrific .
i' m just eating .
he is .
oh , my god .
i feel like such an idiot .
don' t .
flirting' s a ritual in ltaly .
just enjoy it .
taste this .
it' s gorgeous .
mmm !
how do you do it ?
do what ?
this .
well , hats make me happy .
and ice cream .
ice cream changed my fate .
it was because of ice cream that my beloved fefe discovered me .
fefe ?
il maestro ,
who ?
federico , darling .
fellini ?
he discovered me in the piazza novena with my parents eating an ice cream .
i was gobbling it down ,
ietting it run all over my chin because i was hungry .
do you like ice cream ? " he asked me .
i didn' t know who he was .
i was 16 .
you are my imagination come to life , " he told me .
he wasn' t just a great director .
he gave great advice .
i' m listening .
fefe said you have to live spherically in many directions .
never lose your childish enthusiasm , and things will come your way .
so now i was getting posthumous advice from il maestro , and i tried to follow it by pulling ivy , spherically and with childish enthusiasm ,
oh , my god .
niente qui ,
niente , not here .
did you look under the bed ?
could you look under the pillow ?
huh !
no .
it' s a joke .
maybe he moved out already .
snakes are famous for changing their minds .
what am i doing here all by myself ?
don' t you think it' s strange ?
me in this big house ?
excuse me .
i' m sorry .
you are cold , signora mayes .
yeah .
thank you .
do you know the most surprising thing about divorce ?
it doesn' t actually kill you ,
iike a bullet to the heart or a head on car wreck .
it should .
when someone you' ve promised to cherish till death do you part says , " i never loved you , " it should kill you instantly .
you shouldn' t have to wake up day after day after that , trying to understand how in the world you didn' t know .
the light just never went on , you know .
i must have have known , of course , but i was too scared to see the truth .
then fear just makes you so stupid .
no .
it' s not stupid , signora mayes .
l' amore e cieco ,
oh , love is blind .
yeah , we have that saying , too .
everybody has that saying because it' s true everywhere .
i don' t want to be blind anymore .
this house has three bedrooms .
what if there' s never anyone to sleep in them ?
and the kitchen , what if there' s never anyone to cook for ?
i wake up in the night thinking , " you idiot .
i mean , you' re the stupidest woman in the world .
you bought a house for a life you don' t even have .
why did you do it , then ?
because i' m sick of being afraid all the time and because i still want things .
i want a wedding in this house , and i want a family in this house .
signora , between austria and ltaly , there is a section of the alps called the semmering .
it is an impossibly steep , very high part of the mountains .
they built a train track over these alps to connect vienna and venice .
they built these tracks before there was a train in existence that could make the trip .
they built it because they knew someday the train would come .
i think your snake has gone for the evening .
yes .
i think you' re right .
signora ,
please stop being so sad .
if you continue like this ,
i will be forced to make love to you .
and i' ve never been unfaithful to my wife .
buonanotte , signora ,
yes .
buonanotte , signor martini .
grazie ,
prego ,
a train track through the alps before there was a train ,
signor martini wants me to have faith ,
something i' ve never been good at , and now i' m even worse at ,
not that i don' t want faith , i' m jealous of the believers ,
but as a fallen away methodist ,
i do not expect to emerge from all of this a catholic , although i admit some interior juggling is going on ,
to my surprise , i have become friendly with mary ,
it started the night she stood by me through the storm , knowing full well i' m not a catholic ,
yet , somehow , she seems more like mary , my favorite aunt , than santa maria ,
aunt mary is everywhere here , her calm presence assuring us that all things will go on as they have before , [ singing " adeste fidelis " ]
buon natale ,
buon natale ,
this is my wife , flora .
oh !
and my daughter , stella .
stella , buon natale ,
bellissima ,
what a beautiful family .
wow .
i thought i might see you , so i have a gift for you .
it is san lorenzo .
he is the patron saint of cooks .
apparently , he was martyred on a grill and seared until he said ,
turn me over .
i' m done on this side .
no !
yes .
and now he is the favorite saint of chefs .
oh !
i think if you prayed to him , he will help you find someone to cook for .
thank you , signor martini .
merry christmas , signora ,
buon natale ,
my prayers to san lorenzo were quickly answered ,
i realized i already had someone to cook for ,
plenty of someones ,
bravo !
ahh !
bravo !
bravo !
bravo !
aah !
aah !
good .
see , frances ?
italian is easy .
no !
aah !
aah !
aah !

si ,
i have talked to her .
why don' t you go sit next to her ?
go on .
okay .
katherine !
francesca !

i' m having my portrait painted .
katherine ?
come through .
i' m in here .
oh .
i' il come back another time .
why ?
you don' t bother me .
frances , this is zeus .
he' s an art student from macedonia .
he' s staying with me while he' s studying the tuscan light .
more vino , darling .
hmm .
he' s not bad .
he' s not good , either .
look , i' m going to go , but i' il come back another time .
oh , you' re so boring !
what ?
i said you' re boring .
look at you !
you' re sad .
again !
you' re like a big black hole .
excuse me , but i ...
fefe always said , " regrets are a waste of time .
they' re the past crippling you in the present .
i just walked in the door .
how are you ever going to be happy if you keep wallowing ?
listen , when i was a little girl ,
i used to spend hours looking for ladybugs .
finally , i' d just give up and fall asleep in the grass .
when i woke up , they were crawling all over me .
so ?
so go work on your house and forget about it .
i said go !
i' m going !
work on the house and forget about it ,
gee , why hadn' t i thought of that ?
there comes a time in every remodeler' s life when one doesn' t want any more helpful advice ,
there comes a time when you no longer want shaky guys staring at you thinking god knows what , whispering things in polish you' re really glad you don' t understand , [ speaking polish ]
there' s only so much you can take before there comes a time when you just have to get out ,
signorina ,
bella !
great .
hilarious .
goodbye !
you are american ?
english ?
irish ?
there you are .
