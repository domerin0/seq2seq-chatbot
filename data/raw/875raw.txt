whoa !

thank you .
happy vacation , honey .
manchurian tung oil !
where did you get this ?
helen got it for me in oslo .
there' s enough here to do the whole table and the bureau .
i wonder what this could be .
oh , honey , you got it .
thank you .
enough to do the entire guest room .
i' m so glad we' re spending our vacation at home .
i' m gonna get started now .
where are you going ?
i' il get it .
be my guest .
maybe you should get it .
i' il go .
oh , no !
jane .
it' s your turn , honey .
good luck , honey .
thanks .
hi , barbara .
i' m glad i caught you .
heard you were on vacation .
that' s right .
complete vacation .
today i' m $260, 000 !
it' s 6 : 45 in the morning .
this offer is real .
from a man in new york city who only saw a photograph .
jane , don' t send people photos of our house .
he wants to bring the wife and family here for some peace and quiet .
that' s what we' re looking for .
this house is too big for you .
it ought to be for a couple with kids .
i didn' t mean anything .
but this house is too big .
i' il see you in a few weeks .
okay ?
think about it .
i was telling barbara about this offer on the house and
come with me to the store .
what for ?
i need a new brush for the tung oil .
and i want to get a part for the model .
just run in , okay ?
two weeks at home .
the perfect vacation .
jane says we should sell the house to someone with a family .
i don' t think it' s any of jane' s business .
besides , we could try again on this vacation .
really ?
what are you saying ?
how are you doing , ernie ?
hi , how are ya ?
morning , adam .
need a haircut before your vacation ?
no , thanks , bill .
how' s the model coming ?
great .
you know , bozman built that foundation in 1835 .
his grandson came
he' s got hair down to his goddamn shoulders .
he says to me , " ' just trim it a little . " '
i took scissors to him so fast  see you later .
this will be great .
wouldn' t you rather go to jamaica ?
no way .
there' s no place like home .
look out for that
perfect start to our vacation .
you' il feel better when you' re dry .
that fire wasn' t burning when we left .
how' s your arm ?
i don' t know .
it feels frozen .
i' il make some coffee and you get wood for the fire .
maybe we should take things extra slow .
do you remember how we got back up here ?
i' m going back to the bridge and retrace our steps .
you saved my  two hours !
you won' t believe what ?
that' s how long you were gone .
what is going on ?
i have to show you something .
look .
there' s that .
and there' s that .
" ' handbook for the recently diseased . " ' deceased .
deceased .
i don' t know where it came from .
look at the publisher .
' handbook for the recently deceased press . " '
you know what ?
i don' t think we survived the crash .
i hate this .
can you give me the basics ?
this book isn' t arranged that way .
what do you want to know ?
why did you disappear when you stepped off the porch ?
are we halfway to heaven or to hell ?
how long will this last ?
i don' t see anything about heaven or hell .
the book reads like stereo instructions .
listen . " ' geographical and temporal perimeters . " ' functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation . " '
this is going to take some time .
damn sandworms .
thirteen percent , huh ?
i better find a job .
let' s see .
business section .
what do we got here ?
the maitlands .
cute couple .
look nice and stupid , too .
i wish i had a better view of the cemetery from here .
i can' t tell which is the best placement for us .
cabin fever ?
i can' t clean properly .
the vacuum' s in the garage and we can' t leave the house .
where are the other dead people ?
why is it just you and me ?
maybe this is heaven .
in heaven there wouldn' t be dust on everything .
it' s jane .
what' s she doing here ?
i don' t know .
jane , up here .
jane !
she can' t see you , right ?
the living usually won' t see the dead .
won' t or can' t ?
it just says " ' won' t . " '
god , this book is so stupid !
i can' t understand anything in it .
barb , honey ... we' re dead .
i don' t think we have much to worry about anymore .
this is great !
just what the doctor ordered .
sorry , ma' am .
delia deetz , welcome home .
charles !
it' s okay , there' s no damage .
see ?
good , sturdy country craftsmanship .
look at that kitchen .
you' il finally be able to cook a decent meal .
come have a look .
a little gasoline .
blowtorch .
no problem .
excuse me .
here we go .
we' il have to rip out the plumbing .
other than that , it' s perfect .
just perfect .
what do you think , honey ?
delia hates it .
i could live here .
careful !
that' s my sculpture .
i don' t mean " ' my " ' as in " ' i bought it . " ' i mean i made it .
put it on the table .
ten minutes .
i' m already perfectly at ease .
it' s perfect .
help !
it' s otho .
otho , why don' t you come in the front door ?
it' s bad luck .
you left the city for me .
i am so happy .
of course you are .
let' s get one thing straight .
we' re here to enjoy the country setting , not to trash the place !
charles , you' re lucky the yuppies are buying condos ... so you can afford what i' m going to have to do to this place .
i' m here to relax and clip coupons , and , damn it , i mean to do it .
then go do it quietly , dear , and let otho and me think .
is the rest of the house as bad as this ?
is this a punishment ?
what are we going to do ?
we' re not completely helpless .
i' ve been reading that book and there' s a word for people in our situation .
ghosts !
let' s get this show on the road .
we' re dealing with negative entertainment potential .
there' s absolutely no organic flow through .
i noticed that , too .
it' s like a giant ant farm .
what ?
i thought i saw something .
you read my mind .
i did ?
few clients are able to read my mind .
they' re not open to the experience .
my god !
we just have to pray the other closets are bigger than this one .
look !
ozzie and harriet .
what happened to these people ?
they died .
look , an indoor outhouse .
viridian .
viridian .
why do i know that name ?
blue green !
hydrated chromic oxide .
remember , i' m schooled in chemistry .
i was a hair analyst .
what ?
briefly .
deliver me from l. l. bean .
i know what you two are up to .
you' re not going to get away with it .
this is not working out .
i will not stop living art just because you need to relax .
i will live with you in this hellhole .
but i must express myself .
if i can' t gut this house and make it my own ...
i will go insane and i will take you with me !
yeah .
well , maybe the house could use a little remodeling .
but why don' t you just leave this room alone , okay ?
i' il get her .
so ?
cover the wallpaper , knock down a few walls and this place might be livable .
what' s on the third floor ?
attic space .
i forgot to lock the attic door .
did you feel something ?
when ?
you don' t have a key ?
maybe charles does .
i have a feeling there' s something very interesting behind this door .
yeah , ghosts of the people who died in this house , and they want us out !
let' s do them a favor .
my god , that was close !
i cannot watch this .
what' s the good of being a ghost if you can' t frighten people away ?
honey ?
no , i' m not putting up with this !
you don' t know what' s out there .
i don' t care .
barbara !
adam !
adam , help .
i' m getting all yellow !
we' re trapped in this house with those people .
i can' t believe we' re eating cantonese .
is there no szechuan up here ?
i plan to have a stroke from the msg in this food .
this is our first meal in this house , so let' s try to make it a pleasant one .
don' t bait your mother .
when we get settled , we' il build you a darkroom in the basement .
my whole life is a darkroom .
one big dark room .
you were miserable in new york city , and you' il be miserable in the sticks .
at least someone' s life hasn' t been upheaved .
i' m happy here .
those people in new york don' t know what they' re missing .
we could become the summer art center of new york .
i could start sculpting again .
i' m only truly happy when i' m sculpting .
that' s a very good idea .
that' il be very time consuming .
first the house .
otho and i have great plans .
we should keep it the way it is .
good idea .
the furniture truck is coming .
we must decide what goes and what stays .
everything goes , along with what' s in the attic .
careful .
tell me what you do and i' il tell you why my husband will fire you .
isn' t there an index ?
no , nothing .
what' s this ?
do you know where that' s going ?
did anyone tell you where
why are there only three sculptures ?
there were four sculptures .
where' s the fourth sculpture ?
what are you doing ?
' betelgeuse , the bio exorcist .
troubled by the living ? " ' ls death a problem and not the solution ?
unhappy with eternity ? " ' having difficulty adjusting ?
call betelgeuse . " '
there' s no number or instructions ?
nothing .
the bio exorcist .
i don' t get it .
straight back .
why don' t you take a break for half an hour ?
put that down !
what the hell are you doing ?
listen to me !
jesus !
why are you doing this to me ?
this is my art and it is dangerous .
you think i want to die like this ?
that little girl saw us .
nobody can see us .
but she did .
what happened to the previous owners ?
they drowned .
yes , they were family .
i was devastated .
here , take that .
is this the key to the attic ?
that skeleton key will open any door .
give that to your father .
you might mention i single handedly decorated that house .
if he needs any advice in that arena have him come see me .
don' t worry .
i locked the door .
having trouble with the living ?
tired of having your home violated ?
want to get rid of them pesky living critters ?
well , come on down and see me , the afterlife' s leading bio exorcist .
yes , sirree !
i want to tell you , i' il do anything !
i' il scare ' em real bad .
i' il do anything to get your business .
hell !
i' il possess myself if i gotta !
yo !
i got demons runnin ' all through me .
come on down and see it .
if you act now , you get a free demon possession with every exorcism .
you can' t beat that , can you ?
bring the little partners .
we' ve got plenty of snakes for them to play with .
say it once , say it twice , third time' s the charm .
and remember
i' il eat anything you want me to eat swallow anything you want me to swallow
but come on down i' il chew on a dog
we need some help .
i read something in this book about emergencies .
here it is . " ' ln case of emergency , draw a door . " '
draw a door ?
i don' t know why we keep looking in that stupid book .
maybe we should try that beetle guy .
you didn' t actually think that would work , did you ?
knock 3 times .
birdies !
can' t you see i' m relaxing ?
i want to tell you what i saw .
what is the point of my coming here if you people won' t let me relax ?
pumpkin , sweetheart ... go help your mother .
maybe you can relax in a haunted house , but i can' t .
hmm , nice building .
bad roof .
good parking .
adam ?
this way , honey .
you don' t have an appointment .
we didn' t know how to make one .
appointment for what ?
what do you want ?
help ?
already ?
just bit the big one two months ago and you want help .
what does that have to do with anything ?
you' il use up all your help vouchers .
d 90s .
you spend 125 years on earth in that house ... during which you get only 3 class one d 90 intercessions with juno .
you probably haven' t read through the manual completely yet .
you' il have to wait if you don' t have an appointment .
an appointment with whom ?
for juno , your caseworker .
number 54, 000, 601 .
ferndock !
want a cigarette ?
no , thank you .
i' m trying to cut down myself .
adam , is this what happens when you die ?
this is what happens when you die .
that is what happens when he dies .
and that is what happens when they die .
it' s all very personal .
i' il tell you something .
if i knew then what i know now , i wouldn' t have had my little accident .
maitland .
party of two .
take the handbook and go to the sixth door .
oh , we forgot our handbook .
come on .
all new arrivals , report to waiting room number eight .
flight 409 is arriving at gate three .
how do i look ?
there are no mirrors on this side .
you look fine .
fine .
thanks .
i' ve been feeling a little flat .
125 years .
i can' t believe this .
i can' t believe they didn' t tell us .
oh , adam , what is this ?
that' s the lost souls ' room .
a room for ghosts that have been exorcised .
poor devils .
that' s death for the dead .
it' s all in the handbook .
keep moving .
five .
this is the sixth door .
boy , this place just gets weirder and weirder .
we' re home !
look at this place !
everything' s different .
all our furniture' s gone .
how long do you suppose we were waiting there ?
three months .
i' d almost given up on you .
i was about to leave .
i do have other clients .
are you juno , our caseworker ?
yes .
i evaluate individual cases and determine ... if help is needed , deserved and available .
are you available ?
what' s wrong ?
we' re very unhappy .
what did you expect ?
you' re dead !
we want to get rid of the people here .
we worked hard on this house .
we probably wouldn' t mind sharing the house with people who were
more like you used to be .
yes .
but these people !
things seem quiet here .
you should thank god you didn' t die in ltaly .
the deetzes !
have you been studying the manual ?
we tried .
the intermediate interface chapter on haunting says it all .
get them out yourselves !
it' s your house .
haunted houses aren' t easy to come by .
we don' t quite get it .
i heard .
tore your faces off .
it' s useless to pull off your heads in front of people who can' t see you .
we should start simply ?
start simply .
do what you know .
use your talents .
practice .
you should have been studying those lessons since day one .
i' ve got to go .
what about that guy in the flyer , betel
don' t even say his name .
you don' t want his help .
we might .
no , you don' t .
he does not work well with others .
what do you mean ?
i didn' t want to bring it up .
but rather than have you make another mistake , i' il tell you .
he was my assistant .
but he was a troublemaker .
he went out on his own ... as a freelance bio exorcist .
claimed he could get rid of the living .
got into more trouble .
i believe he' s been sleazing around your cemetery lately .
the only way he can be brought back ... is by calling his name three times .
but i strongly suggest ... that you remove the deetzes yourselves .
how do we contact you ... if we need you again ?
oh , adam , that guy' s in our cemetery .
she' s right .
we just keep this simple .
we can do this .
hey , you , come here !
hungry ?
come on .
hey , come here .
i got something good for you .
come on over .
we' il have a little bite , something to nosh .
come here !
help me !
maxie , haven' t i always made you money ?
that' s the only real question .
nobody made me money like you .
you were a demon until your nerves went .
it' s just that ...
winter river , connecticut , is , if you' il forgive me , nowhere .
why would i want to invest that kind of money in an old building ?
it' s way the hell up there !
it' s not a building .
that' s the beauty .
the people don' t know the value of their property .
i can buy the whole town .
then we own a whole town full of nowhere .
come and see .
and bring sarah .
all right , charles .
it' s just that i am kind of busy here .
just a minute .
listen .
enough of this talk about visiting , okay ?
i gotta go .
you take it easy up there , big fellow .
good bye .
max , wait , wait .
putz .
lydia , is connecticut so boring ?
i had maxie dean on the phone .
dad' s found a way of making money while i relax , so would you scram ?
your mother will kill you when she sees you cut holes in her $300 sheets .
this is so corny .
is this what we' ve been reduced to ?
sheets ?
think of them as death shrouds .
and the moaning is important .
really moan !
god , how can he stand that woman ?
cut it out !
i' m a child , for god' s sakes .
i feel so stupid .
it' s not stupid .
we' re ghosts !
do you want to spend the next 125 years having breakfast with this woman ?
moan louder .
oh , god !
sick .
sexual perversion .
do that weird sexual stuff in your own bedroom .
ah , no feet .
are you the guys hiding in the attic ?
we' re ghosts !
what do you look like under there ?
aren' t you scared ?
i' m not scared of sheets .
are you gross under there ?
are you night of the living dead under there ?
like all bloody veins and pus ?
night of the what ?
living dead .
it' s a movie .
if i had seen a ghost at your age , i would have been scared out of my wits .
you' re not gross .
why are you wearing sheets ?
we' re practicing .
you can see us without the sheets ?
of course i can see you .
how can you see us and nobody else can ?
i read through that handbook for the recently deceased .
it says , " ' live people ignore the strange and unusual . " '
i myself am strange and unusual .
you look normal .
you read our book ?
yes .
you could follow it ?
yes .
why were you in delia' s bedroom ?
trying to scare your mother .
stepmother .
you can' t scare her .
she' s sleeping with prince valium .
you did this ?
you carved these houses and things ?
and this used to be your house .
why do you want to scare everybody ?
we wanted to frighten you so you would move out .
you don' t know the deetzes .
my father bought this place .
he never walks away from equity .
why don' t you leave ?
we haven' t left since the funeral .
funeral !
god !
you guys really are dead .
this is amazing .
i better go .
wait .
don' t tell your parents we' re here .
unless it will frighten them away .
tell them we are horrible ... desperate ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing ... to get our house back .
what if this is a dream ?
can you do any tricks to prove i' m not dreaming ?
if you are real ghosts , you better get another routine because those sheets ... they don' t work .
ghosts .
you' re telling me we have ghosts in this house .
those pictures are of ghosts .
ghosts !
lydia , i am giving a dinner party tonight for seven people .
my agent , bernard , is bringing a woman who writes for art in america .
in fact , no one dining here has not been in vanity fair except you .
i told them you were too mean to be afraid .
don' t you dare speak to others about me !
being embarrassed in front of the few people who will set foot here scares me .
so let' s play family just for tonight .
lydia' s trying , but they don' t believe her .
she' s got photos .
adam , you have a photo of bigfoot .
my photo of bigfoot is a different story .
we' ve got to get some help .
we' ve got to contact betelmeyer or something .
look .
it' s him , betelgeuse .
go ahead , barbara , say it .
what happened ?
i think we' re in the model .
look at that .
where is he ?
what do we do ?
looks like we dig .
it' s about time !
i say we open it .
maybe we should knock first .
adam .
babs .
you can pick ' em ! ls this a solid relationship ?
do i have a shot ?
excuse me .
sure .
am i overstepping my bounds ?
it' s beautiful !
you picked me .
you didn' t have to , but you picked me .
it makes me want to kiss you guys !
come on , give me one .
i beg your pardon !
let' s get down to business .
i' ve got a card here somewhere .
here .
who do i have to kill ?
hold that for me .
whoa !
there you go .
you don' t have to kill anybody !
possession !
learn to throw your voice .
fool your friends .
fun at parties .
no .
we just want to get some people out of our house .
i understand .
in order to do that , i' il have to get to know you .
we' ve got to get closer .
move in with you for a while .
get to be real pals .
you know what i' m saying ?
save that guy for later .
my wife and i have some questions .
sure , go ahead .
shoot .
what are your qualifications ?
well , i attended juilliard .
i' m a graduate of harvard business school .
i travel extensively .
i lived through the black plague .
i' ve seen the exorcist about 167 times ... and it keeps getting funnier every time i see it !
not to mention the fact that you' re talking to a dead guy !
now what do you think ?
you think i' m qualified ?
can you be scary ?
oh !
i know what you' re asking me .
can i be scary ?
what do you think of this ?
you like it ?
will you excuse us , please ?
sure .
talk amongst yourselves .
let' s go .
i know , but he can be useful later .
we can work something ourselves .
oh , yeah !
excuse me !
what ?
we are leaving now .
don' t go yet .
come on , we' re simpatico .
look at us .
we shop at the same store .
hey , hermano .
yeah , there you go .
we' re like peas in a pod .
you want someone out of the house .
i want to get someone out of your house .
look !
you' ve been to saturn .
i' ve been to saturn !
whoa .
sandworms .
you hate ' em , right ?
i hate ' em myself .
kids , what do i have to do to strike a deal with you two ?
don' t you hate it when that happens ?
let' s go , barbara !
come up for a while .
we' il talk inside .
come on .
i' m not staying .
the place is a mess .
we have to get out of here .
home !
home !
home !
how did you do that ?
hope you like ltalian .
where' d you go ?
hey , where' d you go ?
hey !
you' ve got to work with me here .
i' m just trying to cut a deal .
what do you want me to do ?
where are you ?
you bunch of losers !
you' re working with a professional here !
nice fucking model !
we can do this stuff on our own .
besides , i' m not exposing that little girl to that pervert .
we did call him , and he seemed awfully pissed off .
i don' t care .
i' ve changed my mind .
we can scare them off ourselves tonight .
i have an idea .
what you did with the place is wonderful .
not me .
them .
so ?
do you like them ?
i hope it wasn' t yet another of your dreary suicide attempts .
you know what they say about people who commit suicide .
in the afterlife , they become civil servants .
otho , i didn' t realize you were into the supernatural .
of course !
you remember .
after my stint with the living theater ...
i was one of new york' s leading paranormal researchers ... until the bottom dropped out in ' 72 .
paranormal ? ls that what they' re calling your kind these days ?
don' t mind her .
she' s still upset that somebody dropped a house on her sister .
well , this looks really good .
i saw some ghosts .
it' s a private joke lydia and i share .
it' s not a joke .
yes , it is .
just today she tried to convince me this house is haunted .
kids !
you know , i love them !
ghosts ?
in designer sheets , no less .
i' d like to propose a toast to our intrepid friends ... who braved the expressway and two dozen tollbooths to be with us .
may your buildings go condo .
lydia , favor us about your ghosts .
no !
i am sick of that subject .
delia , lighten up .
i would rather talk about
that' s cute , delia .
otho , are you doing this ?
we did it !
let' s watch them scatter .
any minute now they' il come running out that door screaming .
any minute now .
it' s me , lydia .
they want you to come downstairs .
delia says you can wear any sheets you want .
it was like being in an amusement park .
bam !
i didn' t know i could do the calypso .
who has more fun than us ?
we' re dealing with tracy and hepburn .
a very sophisticated pair .
they even appear in sheets .
charles , why didn' t you tell us about this before ?
we' re not sure we want our secret out .
everyone will want them for parties .
people will pay big money for this .
the enquirer' s offering $50, 000 for proof of life after death .
this is it , charles .
you can get maxie dean up here now .
you think so ?
sarah loves the supernatural .
she' il have him sprint up here in his helicopter ... if you can produce ghosts for her .
i should remind you that i' m delia' s agent .
i have lost money on her work for years .
if anything happened here , i shall handle it .
but not until i' ve seen real proof .
what about this table ?
what do you call what just happened ?
what money ?
don' t you believe in my work ?
here' s lydia .
well ?
they don' t want to come down .
why not ?
i think they were trying to scare you away , and you didn' t get scared .
they' re dead .
it' s a little late to be neurotic .
all right .
this was not a hallucination .
this was real .
we all experienced a superpowerful paranormal experience and it was real .
delia , you are a flake .
you have always been a flake .
if you insist on frightening people , do it with your sculpture .
drive carefully !
i' m dead .
where do they hide ?
the attic .
the attic' s locked .
they' re ghosts .
they can do what they want .
they do whatever they want .
take us up there right now .
fabulous !
otho fenlock' s " ' locked door ghosts ! " '
probably committed suicide there .
i' m enchanted .
in there ?
they must live like animals .
it' s locked .
how did they get in ?
open this door , dead people , or we' il bust it down ... and drag you out by the ropes you hanged yourself with !
they didn' t commit suicide .
it doesn' t matter .
i can teach you something here .
take the upper hand in all situations ... or people , dead or alive , will walk all over you .
open up !
where are they ?
these ghosts are nice people .
i think we scared them away , so let' s leave them alone , all right ?
it' s the whole damn town .
i have never been so embarrassed .
have they gone for good ?
dad , don' t .
mom , let' s just go .
no ghosts here .
come on ! lf they are in here , i don' t want to scare them away .
we' re leaving now .
you can go about your business .
what are we doing ?
quick , quick , quick .
oh , boy !
you guys are really spooksters , aren' t you ?
now , let' s turn on the juice and see what shakes loose .
otho , get maxie on the phone .
we' ve really got something here .
we can turn this place into the world' s leading supernatural research center .
amusement park .
i' il do a presentation , lydia will bring the ghosts .
i can' t bring the ghosts .
they' re not here .
otho , can' t you do something ?
if i' m properly motivated .
what type of motivation do you require ?
why don' t you leave them alone ?
they didn' t do anything to you .
we' ve come for your daughter , chuck .
stop !
stop !
betelgeuse , betelgeuse , betelgeuse !
oh , no !
why are you doing this ?
leave me alone , all of you !
great choice !
we spend the next century hanging out a window or doing tricks .
great choice !
we spend the next century hanging out a window or doing tricks .
maybe they' il leave now .
that snake was a nasty customer .
he could' ve hurt somebody .
but he didn' t .
we' ve got them where we want them .
you losers !
how dare you interrupt a professional while he' s working !
i' m not fond of charles , but you could' ve killed him .
i' m just doing my job !
i thought we had a deal .
it' s okay .
you know why ?
i don' t want to do business with you deadbeats anyway , thank you .
the only one i think i can deal with is edgar allan poe' s daughter .
she understands me .
leave her alone !
go ahead , make my millennium .
i' m feeling a little anxious , if you know what i mean .
it' s been about 600 years .
i wonder where an everyday joe like myself ... can find a little action .
yeah .
here i come , baby .
hey , adam , nice move !
why did you build that ?
i didn' t .
will you guys shut up and leave me alone ?
i' ve got all this paperwork to do .
you two , come in .
sit down .
get in here , both of you !
the whorehouse was my idea .
i want betelgeuse out of the picture .
you have really screwed up .
i heard you allowed yourselves to be photographed .
you let betelgeuse out and didn' t put him back .
and you let otho take the handbook !
when ?
never trust the living !
we cannot have a routine haunting like yours ... provide proof that there is existence beyond death .
coach , where' s the men' s room ?
i' m not your coach .
he survived .
let me get something straight .
what' s our curfew ?
get out of here !
go on , get downstairs !
men' s room !
are you kidding ?
can' t you read signs ?
i' il be right back .
maybe this was a bad idea .
i didn' t say anything .
who are we kidding ?
you' ve never had a bad idea .
yeah ?
this could all work out .
home .
i' m not sure this is the right environment for lydia .
snakes .
ghosts .
shrimp .
you family types .
you' ve got other things to worry about .
maxie dean is coming tonight .
you have to sell these ghosts .
i can only do so much .
what are you going to do ?
viciously rearrange their environment ?
i know as much about the supernatural as i do about interior design .
i am alone .
i am ... utterly alone .
by the time you read this ...
i will be gone ... having jumped
having plummeted off ... the winter river bridge .
i don' t care what it takes .
you get the deetzes out of there now !
wait a minute .
what are you going to do ?
to scare them .
i want to make sure it' s not some silly parlor trick .
i' il go first .
not bad .
not bad .
now you .
go ahead !
you look great .
go clean house and don' t forget the photographs and the handbook .
coach ?
what ?
i don' t think we survived that crash .
how did you guess ?
mr. and mrs. maitland ?
hello !
how are you ?
dead .
dead , dead , deadski .
of course they' re dead .
they' re ghosts .
no , i mean they' re gone .
split .
out of here .
afterlife kids .
deceased .
are you a ghost , too ?
i' m the ghost with the most , babe .
you look like somebody i can relate to .
maybe you could help me get out of here .
i gotta tell you , this death thing
it' s creepy .
here' s my problem .
i' ve got friends on the outside i said i' d meet .
i have to be there in person .
so could you help me get out of here ?
i want to get in .
why ?
you' ve probably got your reason , but i can' t do anything from here .
if you could get me out , over there , maybe we could talk .
but to do that you' ve got to say my name three times .
what' s your name ?
i can' t tell you .
why not ?
if i tell you , you' il tell your friends , they' il call me all the time .
i' ve got to go to shopping centers for openings , sign autographs , that shit .
it makes my life hell , okay ?
a living hell .
but maybe if you have a pen i know !
do you play charades ?
yeah .
good .
here we go .
ready ?
two words .
right !
first word , two syilables .
look .
turn around .
i don' t know what your signal means .
look behind you !
hi .
how are you ?
beetle .

orange beetle ?
beetle fruit ?
beetle breakfast ?
beetle drink ?
beetle juice ?

the snake .
you kids and your imagination !
just say it !

i want to talk to barbara .
you don' t need to talk to barbara !
just say it !
adam , i can' t go through with it .
i like that little girl .
but it' s too late .
we have to go through with this .
no , we don' t .
can' t we rebel ?
i want to be with lydia .
come on !
just say it !
no , don' t say it !
say it !
it' s okay .
it' s us .
what' s going on ?
beetle
he said if i let him out he would take me to the other side to find you .
no , lydia , we' re dead .
i want to be dead , too .
being dead doesn' t make things any easier .
listen to her on this .
this is something we know a lot about .
and you can visit us anytime you want .
i have a feeling things are going to be better from now on .
what do you mean , better ?
we' ve decided we' re going to invite you and your family to stay .
that' s right .
can' t we bring maxie up here ?
you' ve got a stake in this , too .
this is a presentation .
it requires a sense of occasion , a sense of style .
it' s big .
how will we get it out ?
it' s sectional .
wait , there are plugs .
careful !
okay , go .
what' s going on ?
i don' t know .
i' il find out .
be careful .
ed cornwell will head the wax museum ... dedicated to 50 great moments of the paranormal in thanksgiving park .
you must remember ed .
he' s the genius who gave us the talking marcel marceau statue .
and d con is on its knees to sponsor the insect zoo ... in the old hardware store .
we can' t lose !
lydia , you decided to join us .
i just finished the initial presentation .
now it' s time to have a stretch ... and to invite our friends to meet your friends .
are they here yet ?
charles , we' re here to see some ghosts .
they' re not here ... anymore .
every time she says that , the paint peels ... and some wild creature tries to kill us .
but we have pictures , lydia .
really .
they said they' d come back and we could all live here ... if you agreed not to tease them or make them do stupid tricks .
she has a tendency to overreact .
don' t worry , we' re not relying on her .
we have otho .
are they still here ?
otho , are they still here ?
they' re still here .
they' re just hiding out .
probably feel guilty about what they did to me .
they' re sorry they didn' t kill you .
i just want to see them .
otho , can you do it ?
it' il be tricky , but i think i can handle it .
what am i worried about ?
you can' t even change a tire .
i' il be needing something personal of theirs .
you' il have to go to goodwill .
excuse me .
the wedding clothes .
the words
' hands vermilion
' start of five
' bright cotillion " ' raven' s dive
' nightshade' s promise
' spirits strive
' to the living , let now the dead come alive " '
barbara ?
' as sudden thunder pierces night " ' as magic wonder mad affright
' rives asunder man' s delight
' our ghost , our corpse
' and we rise to be " '
stop it !
' as flies the lizard serpent fell
' as goblin vizard at the spell
' the buried , dead and slain rise again " '
what' s happening to them ?
i don' t know .
they' re dying !
they' re already dead .
they can' t feel a thing .
that' s not true !
look at them !
that' s enough .
can you stop this ?
it' s too late , charles .
i' m sorry .
where are you ?
help them , please .
sure , i can help them .
but you' ve got to help me .
what ?
i' m what you call an illegal alien .
i want out for good .
to do that , i' ve gotta get married .
these aren' t my rules .
come to think of it , i don' t have any rules .
come on .
think of it as a marriage of inconvenience .
we both get something .
i get out , you get the most eligible bachelor since valentino .
we' re even .
okay , just help them .
sure .
beetlejuice .
it' s show time .
