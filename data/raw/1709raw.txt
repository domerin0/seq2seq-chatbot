no , it looks like a normal web page , except for that icon .
click on it . then press " contrl shift " .
my god !

it' s just a glitch that sends you to the wrong internet address .
last night i got amtrak and the mayo clinic .
they have different subnets .
i accessed a system i shouldn' t have .
that disk is power
then find the error and delete it .
i' m not ready to do that yet .

my most embarrassing secret ?
you know " breakfast at tiffany' s " ?
it' s my favourite film .
i wore out my membership renting it .
you know what i' m talking about , then .
when i was about thirteen , i had this sort of ... ... identity crisis .
i thought i was in the film .
that you were audrey hepburn ?
no .
i used to think i was the cat .
i' d sit there and i' d play out the last scene of the movie  over and over again .
you know the last scene ?
the alleyway in the pouring rain .
i' m soaked to the bone , and i' m scared . and ...
i' m abandoned .
i' m alone .
and that' s it .
would you have dinner with me tonight ?
come on , it' s your last night !
you know what ?
i' d actually really love to .
great .
it' s a company perk .
some perk !
i think i got a calendar one year from cathedral .
you' re from colorado ?
it has to be the eastern ... ... or maybe the southeastern part of the state .
the teeming metropolis of la junta .
population , fifty .
is my accent that strong after all these years ?
no , it' s just a trick i do .
after all these years ?
how long ?
it seems like a lifetime ...
let' s see ...
i was fifteen , going on ten ,  and we moved from la junta to san jos .
tulsa ...
your father got transferred ?
not really .
i don' t know , he just ... transferred out , one day .
what are you looking at ?
you .
me ?
computers are your life , right ?
yes , the perfect hiding place .
a picture of you .
yeah , okay ...
i have one or two other interests .
such as ?
what' s your speciality ?
anything , pretty much .
beta testing , mostly .
that' s way over my head .
you just go into people' s systems , find the faults . and fix them .
what if there are no faults ?
i don' t believe i' ve met one , yet .
you must be a bit cold .
not really ...
yeah , a little bit .
here .
it goes round here .
want one ?
i used to smoke those ...
but you quit , right ?
well .
i refuse to .
i try to do without a safety net .
how else do you know you' re alive ?
i take my share of risks .
i don' t always floss .
i rip the tags off my pillows when they' re new .
my kind of woman !
feeling adventurous ?
what did you have in mind ?
dare you risk it ?
my purse !
no , it' s not worth getting killed over .
jack . come back !
it' s not here .
or at the hotel .

so i do like magician ...

i apologise for being a jerk .
what do you mean ?
i' m the jerk .
i was only trying to impress you .
for future reference , the living interest me more than the dead .
i suppose that' s quite healthy .
i suppose we should call the cancun police on the radio .

it' s beautiful out here .
how are we doing ?

i' m just going down below .

i wish i had been that lucky .

you know the story .
i thought i was lonely , and ... ... he forgot he was married .
but it didn' t last very long .
and then my mom developed alzheimer' s . so it was ...

i don' t understand .
why me ?
i' m nobody .
they knew everything .
what i ate and drank . what movies i watched .  where i was from . what cigarettes i used to moke ...
they must watch the internet .
our whole lives are on computer .
they knew i could be " vanished ' " and no one would care .
it' s okay .
what can i do ?
put my mom somewhere else .
put her under a different name .
you can do that . as a doctor ?
sure .
i can put your mom in the county sanitarium .
how' s that ?
it would mean a lot .
she' s all i' ve got left .
christ , angie !
they' ve really gotten into your head with this .
put yourself in my shoes .
suddenly you ring with this convoluted story .
listen , i don' t buy the whole story , but i have a friend in the fbl ...

i' m running from the police .
that' s the last thing i need .

bob fox
hi .
bob fox ?
they killed dale .
now they think i have the programme .
first you say someone tried to kill you , then dale ?

why would anyone do all this ?
they would want someone at cathedral to overwrite the programmes .
and you can' t do that from outside .
you know devlin' s internet number ?
i plugged it in , and got into michael bergstrom' s medical files .
the guy who blew his head off ?
a computer said he had alds .
but when they did the autopsy , there was no hlv .
if you' re dead , you get the truth .
i' m starting to believe you .
i need to go to cathedral and find " mozart' s ghost " .

are you all right ?
pull over .
you' re scaring me .
the pills ...

it' s safer to stay right here .
sorry , bob couldn' t make it .
is that how to greet an old lover ?
you' re not one .
i' m surprised you didn' t kill me , then fuck me !
it was difficult . because i was attracted to ou .
i still am .
i' m going to attract the police if you don' t go away .
you' ve been avoiding them since you ran away .
they' d be interested to hear how you killed dale and came after me .
go ahead !
they' il be happy to make your acquaintance .
did you know that ruth marx has a criminal record for drugs  and prostitution ?
you' ve got quite a record .
like bergstrom' s ?
i know about his suicide . and about the praetorians .
i' m sure they' d love to hear about that .
everybody has their button .
and bergstrom' s was homophobia .
you just have to know ... which button to push .
i don' t have your disk .
it was ruined in mexico .
that' s okay .
but what we need now is what' s up here , so come with me .
i promise you , i' il look after you .
what do you want ?
it' s not what i want .
it' s what my employers want .
take a look around you .
are things working ?
no .

by killing people ?
i don' t ask too many questions .

i' m sorry .
it was the insulin ...

he was on penicillin .
he was being treated for diabetes .

he was not a diabetic !
but it says on his file ...
hello ?
it' s great to hear your voice .
don' t hang up , angela !
this is important ifyou wouldjust  take a step back from this , you' d see we' re not so different .
we' re both loners . both isolated . both really trusting . ,
we' re both looking for the same clarity .
you mean a great deal to me .
yeah ?
you mean shit to me .
i admit an arrogance in my perceptions of you .
i' ve come to vis t a fri . d ofmine .
an old piano teacher friend , you leave my mother alone .
i seem to have no choice .
she' s been moved by dr champion .
the late dr. champion .

my name is angela bennett ...

flngerprlnt match
mother dead from overdose
i want to help you , but what you' re saying is so far fetched .
they changed your name , medical records , crashed planes .. ?
just think about it .
our whole world is sitting there on a computer .
everything .
your car records , your social security ,  your credit cards , your medical history .
it' s all there .
like a little electronic shadow just begging to be screwed with .
today it' s me , tomorrow it' s you .
look .
miss marx ...
i' m not ruth marx .
they put her on your computer .
i hate to tell you this , but all the police computers  have for the last six months been protected by " gatekeeper " .
so nothing that you' re describing could possibly happen .
oh my god , it' s the programme .
gatekeeper has a flaw .
if they changed my identity , the praetorians must know !
then that solves it .
where did you get the stolen car ?
okay , listen to me .
it' s like a trojan horse , this thing , the praetorians .
they hack into computers and cause chaos .
lax , wall street , the department of water and power in atlanta ...
they do it so that people buy this programme for security .
only to find out they' ve given the praetorians access to the system .
imagine what they can do with this power .
this is fascinating , miss marx .
please , my name is bennett .
write it down , if you want .
b e n n e t t.
why would i make this up ?
i' m your appointed attorney .
i' m obligated to do as you wish .
i' il call you cleopatra if you want .
but if you go before the judge with this craziness .  you will be found incompetent to stand trial  and they will hold you indefinitely .
hi .
yeah , this is her daughter .
hi mom .
it' s me .
are you doing okay ?
how' s that new nurse treating you ?
it' s angela , mom .
it' s angela .
mom . listen .
i need you to do something for me .
there' s a lady here ...
she' s going to take the phone , and you tell her that i' m me .
because she doesn' t believe me .
can you tell her that , mom ?
mom . don' t .
are yo there ?
i just want you to know that i love you .
lady ?
what ?
who' s come to get me ?
special agent ben phillips , fbl .
i' m alan' s friend .
terrible , what happened to him .
i' m so glad that you' re here .
as soon as i heard your story i had half our agents chasing this down .
beating every bush , trying to find you .
sorry it had to be here .
me too .
let' s get out of here .
there' s an office 40 minutes away .
and then what ?
then i' m going fishing for a shark named jack devlin .
know him ?
he' s a one man dirty duty squad .
efficient and lethal .
the moral conscience of a chainsaw .
but the guys behind him are worse .
the praetorians .
we' ve been chasing them for years .
but we have to move a. s. a. p .. so sketch me a quick backgroud .
how the hell did you access their system in the first place ?
i didn' t , a programmer at cathedral sent a disk to me .
a goddamn disk !
that' s what started all this up .
did you make a copy of the disk before it was ruined in mexico ?
no .
damn !
that disk is our only hope ofcatching these bastards .
did you give any copies away ?
you are amazing sons of bitches .
how did you know it was ruined ?
i only told devlin that .
you' re not even fbl .
but it doesn' t matter .
ever since i got that disk i' ve gone from one nightmare to the next .
but now i' m tired of it .
get off the gas !
you' re gonna kill us .
