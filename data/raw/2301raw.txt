they' re sending a helicopter to pick you up .
some sort of emergency .
it usually is .
thank you .
good afternoon , mr. bond .

one of my less useful people .
you are now flying remote control airways .
think twice , 007 .
it' s a long way down .
i' ve looked forward to this moment , mr. bond .
i intend to enjoy it to the full .
really , have you no respect for the dead ?
good bye , mr. bond .
i trust you had a pleasant ... fright .
you are fading from my picture , mr. bond .
but the end cannot be far away .
mr. bond !

for your eyes only

afternoon .
how' s it looking topside ?
beautiful day .
just bringing the nets in .
fish for supper again .
decode of russian satellite data , sir , on british and american ship positions .
verify and advise admiralty .
yes , sir .
afternoon , sir .
oh , hello , mac .
my watch .
where the hell did that come from ?
what the devil' s going on here ?
an unidentified object closing fast .
destruct atac system .
yes ?
first sea lord and vice admiral , sir .
send them in .
shocking news , minister .
i' m afraid we' ve lost our electronic surveillance ship , the st. georges .
we had a routine message at 1600 hours yesterday ... then nothing .
we sighted floating debris this morning .
my god , jack .
how deep is the water there ?
not deep enough , i' m afraid .
yes , comrade secretary .
off albania .
the suspected british spy ship which we have been monitoring .
it suggests that there is a chance of obtaining ... the atac transmitter .
oh , of course , comrade .
there will be no direct involvement ... but if it comes on the market , we should not lose ... such a remarkable opportunity .
with that in mind , i' ve already contacted our usual friend in greece .
down you go .
go on .
down you go .
give us a kiss .
give us a kiss .
i' il give you a nut .
here you are .
go on .
come on .
your packages , senorita .
oh , thank you .
melina !
thank you , darling .
hello , daddy .
welcome home , melina , my darling .
you look beautiful .
thank you .
your call from athens was such a pleasant surprise .
i was lucky to find you .
you left crete so suddenly .
ah , yes , i wanted to come back here and start work on the temple again .
you between jobs ?
only for a few days .
i' il lend a hand if you want .
darling , it' s beautiful .
thank you .
that' s for you , and pistachios for max .
james .
moneypenny , a feast for my eyes .
what about the rest of you ?
well , i was going to get around to that .
you' d better go in .
m' s on leave ... and the minister' s arrived here with the chief of staff ... and wants to see you immediately .
i' il be right back .
i can hardly wait .
oh , haven' t you forgotten something ?
oh .
well , as m' s away
ah , there you are , 007 .
minister , chief of staff .
are you aware of our atac system , 007 ?
atac , sir ?
automatic targeting attack communicator .
uses an ultra low frequency coded transmitter ... to order our submarines to launch ballistic missiles .
five days ago , our spy ship , st. georges was sunk ... in the lonian sea .
she was equipped with atac .
now , if that transmitter were to fall into the wrong hands ... it would render our entire polaris fleet useless .
every order could be countermanded .
worse .
our own submarines could be ordered to attack our own cities .
have we begun a salvage operation , minister ?
an official operation was out of the question .
the st. georges was off the albanian coast .
we asked sir timothy havelock ... the marine archaeologist , to secretly locate the wreck .
before he could send in his report , he and his wife were killed ... by a cuban hit man , hector gonzales .
the greek police were able to identify gonzales ... from a description given to them by melina , sir havelock' s daughter .
operation undertow .
the information' s all here .
now , gonzales is at a villa near madrid .
isolate him and apply the necessary pressure ... to find out who hired him .
a walther ppk ... standard issue , british secret service .
license to kill .
or be killed .
take him away .
whoever you are , you' ve outstayed your welcome .
come on .
well , i hope you have a car .
this way .
hurry .
who are you ?
he killed my parents .
the havelocks ?
i' m sorry .
how did you know where gonzales was ?
through a detective agency .
what were you doing there ?
i' m afraid we' re being out horsepowered .
excuse me .
take the low road .
not that low .
you don' t mind if i drive , do you ?
go backwards .
forwards .
quickly .
i love a drive in the country , don' t you ?
hold tight .
oh , by the way , we haven' t been properly introduced , melina .
my name is bond , james bond .
olympic has a flight at 11 : 00 .
it should be safe to go to the airport now .
are you all right ?
i' m fine , really .
are you going back to your father' s ship ?
yes , i' m continuing his work , but this business is still unfinished .
what business ?
the man who paid gonzales .
before setting out on revenge , you first dig two graves .
i don' t expect you to understand .
you' re english , but i' m half greek .
and greek women , like electra ... always avenge their loved ones .
i must go .
you were meant to question gonzales , not let miss havelock perforate him .
i quite agree , sir .
we' il have to tell the prime minister operation undertow is dead in the water .
she' il have our guts for garters .
if you care to look again ... at page two , paragraph four of my report , sir ... you will note that i saw someone paying off gonzales .
now , assuming that that was for havelock' s murder ... then there' s still a glimmer of hope .
i don' t follow .
if we could identify that someone
why don' t you try the identigraph ?
yes , sir .
get cracking , 007 .
minister .
hello , q.
smithers , how' s the arm ?
coming along very nicely , thank you , sir .
oh , that' il come in handy .
what are you doing here , 007 ?
identigraph , q.
this way .
stinging in the rain ?
that' s not funny , 007 .
i see you managed to get the lotus back together again .
i disregard these jibes about our equipment , 007 .
i don' t suppose you find it funny in the field .
indeed , i don' t .
this 3 d visual ldentigraph is still in the experimental stage .
now , once we get a composite of the man ... we can find a match by patching into the photographic files ... of the surety , lnterpol , cla , the mossad .
and the west german police .
you' ve told me so already five times .
thank you , 007 .
right .
now describe the person you wish to identify ... and i' il program the information .
male caucasian , late thirties .
hair : fine , light brown .
that' s it .
parted in the middle .
wait a minute .
right .
eyes .
a little smaller .
uh huh .
blue .
a little grayer .
that' s it .
you have it .
now , nose .
a nose , not a banana , q.
i' m sorry .
stop .
lips fuller .
mm hmm .
oops .
no , no , mouth wider .
good .
thank you .
thank you , sharon .
you can go .
i' il lock up .
okay .
i reckon we' re almost there , q , apart from glasses .
steel rimmed .
yeah .
octagonal .
octagonal .
that' s him .
that' s our man .
right .
i' il try and get a match .
yes .
the man we want is emile leopold locque ... an enforcer in the brussels underworld .
he' s been convicted of several ... particularly brutal murders .
he escaped from namur prison ... by strangling his psychiatrist .
he has worked for drug syndicates in marseilles and hong kong .
now reported working for greek smugglers .
the ltalian secret service think that he is , at this moment , in cortina .
i' il instruct ferrara , our man in northern ltaly , to contact you there .
yes , sir .
and 007 , try not to muck it up again .
i' il do my best , sir .
i' il leave you to lock up .
let me out , will you ?
the snow this year is better at lnnsbruck .
but not at st. moritz .
ferrara .
bond .
james .
luigi .
i presume london has briefed you .
if locque' s in cortina , we' il find him .
i have a reliable greek contact here , an anglophile .
he helped us out last year on a smuggling operation .
what' s he doing in cortina ?
he
spends a few months a year here at his chalet .
he' s in shipping , insurance , oil exploration .
knows everything going on .
very reliable .
the british gave him the king' s medal for resistance fighting during the war .
yes , but can i meet him ?
i' ve set it up .
he is waiting for us at the olympic ice rink .
kristatos .
ari kristatos .
bond .
james bond .
would you care to join me in some gluhwein ?
that' s a very good idea .
thank you .
well , gentlemen , how can i help you ?
we' d like some information .
my protege .
a sure winner ... in the next olympics .
she' s completely absorbed in her skating ... but innocent in the ways of the world .
the day she wins the gold medal ... will be the greatest in my life .
bibi , here are some new admirers for you .
mr. bond , mr. ferrara , bibi dahl ... and her coach , jacoba brink , once a world class skater herself .
i' ve seen miss brink skate .
i think the world will soon be seeing a great deal of your skating too .
only if she works harder .
much harder .
oh , uncle ari .
can i stop now ?
i' m pooped .
that' s for miss brink to decide .
come , bibi , another half hour of practice .
uncle ari , will you take me to the biathlon ?
bibi , you know i have to work this afternoon .
bibi wants to know if you would escort her , mr. bond .
i don' t think  i would feel better ... if there were someone with her .
i' d be delighted .
i' m staying at the miramonti .
great !
how can i help ?
do you know this man ?
yes .
locque .
columbo' s right hand .
milos columbo .
his name came up in connection ... with a smuggling operation last year .
that' s the least of his offenses .
drugs , white slavery , contract murder .
in the greek underworld , he in known as " the dove .
a very sick joke .
where is this dove ?
somewhere in greece , i would guess .
once we were like brothers .
now he hates me .
we fought together in the greek resistance ... then against the communists .
after that , he took a different path .
thank you for your time , mr. kristatos .
my pleasure .
i leave for corfu soon .
if i get any more information , i will call ferrara .
what do you think , luigi ?
does this " dove " columbo ... have the resources to mount a salvage operation ?
oh , definitely .
he runs a fleet of intercoastal freighters in the aegean .
i' il ring my office in milano .
they may have more on him .
i' il see you later .
okay .
is this the one you mean ?
thank you .
i' il take it .
deliver it to the hotel cristalo .
i beg your pardon .
may i help you ?
yes , give me a dozen lilies .
will you ?
i' il pick them up later .
come on , quickly .
send them to the funeral , will you ?
slow down .
would you mind telling me what the devil you' re doing in cortina ?
your telegram .
what telegram ?
it said you found the man and to meet you here today .
i didn' t send it .
now , get in .
the station , please .
are we leaving ?
not " we . " you .
and now .
you don' t tell me what to do .
did you find the man who hired gonzales ?
i' m working on it .
he' s here , isn' t he ?
that' s why you' re here .
driver , stop !
go back !
i' m staying .
so you can put an arrow in his back ?
you do that , and we' il never find out who or what is behind all this .
it was my parents they killed , not yours .
let me out .
driver , stop !
melina , look at me .
you were lucky once , but they are onto you now .
the telegram , the motorcycles back there .
they prove it .
let me handle this .
you ?
how are you involved ?
all i can tell you is it' s something of vital interest to both our countries .
more important than my parents ?
your father was part of it .
he thought it important enough to risk his life .
now , melina , please trust me .
go back to the triaina and wait .
let me find out what i can here , then i' il come straight to corfu .
i promise you .
okay .
i' il go back and wait , but not for long .
it won' t be , i swear .
don' t they have showers at the ice rink ?
how did you get in here ?
one of the porters is a fan .
he' il do anything for me , and i' il do anything for you .
well , i' m exceedingly flattered , bibi ... but you' re in training .
that' s a laugh .
everybody knows it builds up muscle tone .
how about building up a little more muscle tone by putting on your clothes ?
don' t you like me ?
i think you' re wonderful , bibi ... but i don' t think your uncle ari would approve .
him ?
he thinks i' m still a virgin .
yes , well , you get your clothes on , and i' il buy you an ice cream .
shall we ?
don' t you ever come up for air ?
that' s why i' il get the gold medal breath control .
yes , well , you can' t lose .
and now , erich kriegler ...
iast year' s east european champion .
there' s erich kriegler .
the east german champion ?
isn' t he beautiful ?
you know something , bibi ?
you' re fickle .
hey , erich !
come on , let' s go watch him shoot .
we' il have a drink at the finish .
well , bibi , i' m afraid i have to leave you .
no , james , stay with me .
i have an appointment .
will you come and say good bye to me at the practice rink later ?
please , james , we' re going back to greece soon .
all right , but if i can' t make it ... all i can say is don' t grow up any more .
huh ?
the opposite sex won' t survive it .
won' t take long .
don' t play with any of the switches .
right .
what took you so long ?
i took the scenic route .
tell me more about your boyfriend , erich kriegler .
he doesn' t smoke , he only eats health foods and he won' t even talk to girls .
james , you' re jealous .
of course .
what else can you tell me about my rival for your affections ?
they say he' s a defector from east germany .
it is time for your rubdown .
i could eat you up alive .
farewell , mr. bond , but not good bye .
i' il be finished around 6 : 00 .
meet me here .
how did you know i was here ?
i radio telephoned the triaina , and they told me you were coming ashore .
i have to go shopping for the crew .
come with me , we can talk .
why not ?
thank you .
i think you may need that .
my father loved the view from here .
i can see why .
we came here often .
is corfu your home ?
no .
my real home' s always been the triaina , the greek islands ...
turkey , north africa wherever my father' s work took us .
did he leave any notes ?
they could help us .
no , i don' t think so .
to tell you the truth ...
i haven' t had the courage to go into his study since .
try not to think about it now .
i' m meeting a man tonight at the casino who may give us a lead .
you' re perspiring , bunky .
contessa .
500, 000 .
only half ?
where' s your courage , bunky ?
courage is no match for an unfriendly shoe , countess .
bravo , bunky .
lucky night .
the odds favor standing pat .
if you play the odds .
would you cash these in for me , please ?
thank you .
excuse me .
aperitif , please ?
ouzo for me , please .
and a whiskey .
and to eat ?
i' il have the prawns , salad and bourdetto .
an excellent choice .
i' il have the same .
may i suggest a white wine from my home place ?
if you' il forgive me , that' s a little too scented for my palate .
i prefer the theotaki aspro .
after our last meeting , i am asking myself ... why you want to know about locque , columbo' s man .
i know columbo runs heroin to be refined here ... before it' s sent to england .
so i think i see the answer .
you' re from the british narcotics board .
am i right ?
go on .
i wish you luck , my friend .
but i must warn you , stopping columbo will be difficult .
he has important connections .
you cannot just arrest him .
find some different way .
you may have to kill him .
does this discourage you ?
just tell me where he is .
over there .
with the woman in blue .
we ignore each other , but i wanted you to see him .
he is a secret partner in this casino .
but we are perfectly safe .
he will do nothing in his own place .
and the countess ?
lisl , an austrian .
expensive mistress .
she sometimes shills for the house .
she bets with other people' s money .
but i must warn you , stopping columbo will be difficult .
he has important connections .
you cannot just arrest him .
you must find a different way .
you may have to kill him .
does this discourage you ?
just tell me where he is .
you are a disgusting man .
how dare you talk to me like that ?
i will speak to you any way i please .
sit down .
you' re making a spectacle of yourself .
get out !
nothing would please me more .
this may be an opportunity .
this may be a trap .
if you play the odds .
as you wish .
take my car .
i' il play a little chemin .
ask the chauffeur to come back for me .
allow me .
may i drive you home ?
no , thank you .
i' il take a taxi .
no courage ?
seriously , you may have a job finding one .
well , you look like a gentleman .
why not ?
i am the countess lisl von schlaf .
my name is bond .
i' m writing a novel about greek smugglers .
know any ?
smugglers ?
how would i know any smugglers ?
i would think that a lady in your position ... would get to know many things .
i' d be most grateful .
how grateful ?
very .
i adore grateful men .
may i call you tomorrow , countess ?
i' m a night person .
i have champagne and oysters in the fridge .
why not come in for a bite ?
i won' t need you anymore tonight .
cheers .
bottoms up .
whoops !
me nightie' s slipping .
so is your accent , countess .
manchester ?
close .
liverpool .
it was an amusing performance ... between you and the owner of this .
what exactly did columbo whisper to you ?
that you' re a spy .
to find out more about you .
and have you ?
have i ever .
when you' re ready to leave , you can take my car .
that sounds like a dismissal .
i was looking forward to breakfast .
lisl , come back !
get in ooh !
goodbye , countess .
what
what should i do with you ?
you cannot just arrest him .
you must find a different way .
you may have to kill him .
does this discourage you ?
huh ?
just tell me where he is .
i' m here , mr. bond of the british secret service .
but i' il tell you ... it is kristatos you want , not me .
he told you about himself .
he' s the one with the powerful connections .
locque works for him , not for me .
i smuggle , yes .
i smuggle gold , diamonds ... cigarettes , pistachio nuts ... but no heroin .
sit down .
that i leave to him ... when he is not too busy working for russia ... against my country and yours .
my country awarded him the king' s medal .
yes , i know .
but other people died for it .
during the fighting in crete , he was a double agent .
king' s medal .
i would laugh if my heart was not so heavy ... about my poor lisl .
what does kristatos gain by setting you up ?
well , i know too much about him .
he wants me out of the way .
by using a british agent to do his dirty work for him ... your government might give him another medal .
why should i believe you ?
i' il prove it to you tonight .
we' il go together to his warehouse ... in albania , okay ?
if i don' t report in by morning ... not only my people , but the entire greek police will be down on you ...
iike a load of bricks .
don' t worry .
by tomorrow , we' il be good friends .
let us drink to that .
i' il wait till tomorrow .
you may need this .
i' m a good judge of men .
mr. bond , you have what the greeks call tha' ros .
guts .
so have you , mr. columbo .
cheers .
santos ' drug store .
watch it .
j. i. m. diving equipment ... for salvage work at depths of over 300 feet .
raw opium .
an old smuggler' s trick .
kristatos knows them all .
get your men out of here .
now .
you left this with ferrara , i believe .
had no head for heights .
where did the st. georges sink ?
we can' t be sure for certain .
we know it was in this vicinity .
your father was using the temple as a front .
kristatos killed your father ... so he wouldn' t find the st. georges before he did .
kristatos .
how can i help ?
where does your father keep his daily log ?
daily log .
father and he were pals for 30 years .
he repeats everything .
give us a kiss .
what' s his name ?
max .
thank you .
hello .
it' s all shorthand .
he used a special kind .
only i could decipher it .
he made several surveys in neptune .
what' s neptune ?
our two man submarine .
he saw a diving bell here .
diving bell ?
oil exploration .
kristatos .
three days later , he sighted a wreck in the same area .
and ?
that was his last entry .
the day he was killed .
air would be useless at this depth .
we need a mixture of oxygen and helium .
i have the necessary equipment .
the less people that know , the better .
i' il give the crew shore leave except for the mate and two others .
let' s go .
584 feet .
an oxygen helium mix will give us eight minutes .
we' il have to work fast .
wouldn' t the crew have destroyed the transmitter ?
only if they' d had the chance to set the explosive timer .
we have a visitor below .
conserve your gas supply .
speak only when necessary .
i hope he was dining alone .
go back to the sub .
no , no .
i' m staying .
that should be the command cabin .
eureka !
main destruct timer ... under lever right of atac housing , dualled ... by ring main circuit through anti handling charger .
the destruct timer' s set at one minute .
for some reason , the lever wasn' t pulled .
the transmitter with a thermite charge .
hold these .
to bypass trembler switch ... cut wires in following procedure .
cutters .
screwdriver .
that' s it .
let' s get out of here .
james , help !
james , i won' t make it .
we both will .
get to the sub .
i' il stall him .
try and close the co2 .
i' m trying .
careful , james .
it' s 5, 000 years old .
thank you , mr. bond .
you have saved us the trouble of disarming it .
apostis , take that .
where are my men ?
you will be joining them .
let the girl go .
we' il double whatever you' re getting .
i never go back on a deal .
it would be bad for my reputation .
i will deliver it and return with the money .
the voice of the kgb .
our agreement was that i designate the meeting place .
after they pay , i will give them the transmitter .
it must not be let out of your sight .
nor mine .
where are we going ?
we will take the atac to st. cyril' s .
st. cyril' s .
i' il arrange the pickup .
bind that wound .
we don' t want blood in the water yet .
murderer .
you have shot your last bolt , miss havelock .
leave their legs free .
they' il make appetizing bait .
i didn' t think it would end like this .
we' re not dead yet .
hold tight .
turn around .
we go again .
take a deep breath .
again .
hurry .
help !
aw , leave him .
turn .
run them down .
follow me .
ahh .
the sharks have them .
make port .
thank you .
hello .
give us a kiss .
max , not now .
kristatos is still alive .
and probably headed to moscow or havana by now .
we' il never get him .
or the atac .
atac to st. cyril' s .
forgive me , father , for i have sinned .
that' s putting it mildly , 007 .
your signal sent whitehall into shock .
so far we have managed to locate ... 439 st. cyril' s in greece .
heaven only knows to which one kristatos took the atac .
i know a well informed person to contact about that , q.
st. cyril' s , where we used to hide from the germans .
only kristatos would make an abandoned monastery his personal retreat .
my friend , i' ve been studying this place ... for just such an occasion .
we' il split here , huh ?
your best approach is on the right face , away from the building .
then you will have to make towards the shed on the left ... which houses the basket and the electronic winch .
it can be operated only from the shed .
good luck .
should have brought more people .
james is counting on surprise .
but we are only five men .
and one woman .
eighteen ... nineteen ... twenty .
fifty more .
that' s the pits !
i' m supposed to be skating in oslo , in lnnsbruck .
why are we in this creepy place ?
our plans are changed .
we are going to live in cuba for a few months .
cuba !
you can skate without distractions .
i' il be your audience .
what a drag .
i want to win the gold medal .
we all want that .
i know what you want .
but you' re too old for me .
i' m splitting .
you have poisoned her against me !
don' t blow your top , ari .
leave her alone .
i will deal with you ... as i deal with everyone who betrays me .
bibi ... you' re so young .
you must have a sponsor .
i' il find another one .
go outside and check the guards .
let me know when the helicopter arrives .
one of kristatos ' killers .
aah !
shut him up .
get the door .
come on , george .
let' s go .
hurry , unless you want me to go without you .
you know , i will never leave you .
your general is late .
only bad weather would delay him .
cover the windows .
let' s go .
he' s all right .
leave him .
he' s all right .
back !
okay .
let' s go .
i' il be with you .
sorry .
cover the door !
where' s kristatos ?
and keep your voice down .
we are leaving him .
he mustn' t know until we' re gone .
we' il help you if you help us .
come .
where are the guards ?
that way .
wait here .
move !
where' s kristatos ?
the other side of the courtyard .
you better stay here .
what have you done to brink ?
go back to your room !
