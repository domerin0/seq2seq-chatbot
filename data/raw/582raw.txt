brand new college graduate slash princess .
oh , i can' t believe it' s been five years since grandma told me that i was a princess .
me ?
a ... a princess ?
shut up .
and right after that , my mother surprised me by marrying my high school teacher , patrick o' connell .
it must be going well , because they are now expecting a baby .
lilly' s remained the same , as she continues to cause turmoil , but now as a graduate student at berkeley .
which she calls " berserkeley .
how' s michael ? " you may ask .
well , we' re just friends now , as he went off to tour the country with his band .
princess mia .
look out the window , and welcome back to genovia .
oh , there it is .
my beautiful genovia .
of course , i' m completely excited to be going back , but i' m also a bit nervous .
genovia one has landed .
grandma clarisse will step down by the end of this year as queen , and i' il be taking over , since i' m now 21 .
mira , la princesa mia .
it' s the princess from america !
hi .
viva la princesa .
i know i studied diplomacy and political science at school , but ... there is no course in " queen , " or " how to run a country 101 .
but grandma' s going to help me , and i' il take over when she thinks i' m ready .
of course , i wonder ... will i ever be ready ?
in the meantime , i' m going to live in a beautiful palace like in a fairy tale , and eventually sit on a throne and rule the people of genovia .
is that scary or what ?
well , maybe fat louie can give me some help .
her royal highness princess amelia mignonette thermopolis renaldi has arrived .
welcome home , princess .
and her royal pussycat , sir fat louie .
the one downer in my fairy tale is i' ve never been in love .
countess puck of austria .

so maybe i' il meet my prince charming tonight .

i' il survive , your highness .
the fault was entirely my own .
i apologize .
are you sure you don' t want to exchange licenses and proof of insurance ?
no , no .
these shoes were a little big anyway .
the swelling should help them fit better .
hey , get a load of this guy .
shimmy shimmy .
hey , hey , hey .
bitte .
you are a beautiful dancer .
oh , why , thank you so much .
like a deer .
or a chipmunk in the forest .

woodland animals are a lovely thing to be compared to .

your timing is impeccable .
thank you .
you' re welcome , your highness .
mia .
i like to be called mia .

i' m sorry i stepped on your foot .
you can step on my foot anytime .
aww .
it is prince jacques ' turn .
your highness .
if this were my party , we' d be kissing by now .
that' s prince jacques .
he' s about 12 years old .
he' s a very precocious prince .
he wears aftershave to make people think that he' s older .
may i blow in your ear ?
can you reach it ?
princess , there' s someone from parliament you should meet .
charlotte , how many members of parliament are there ?
only two left , your highness .
cake , ladies ?
oh , dear .
oh , your highness , pardon me , i am so sorry .
it was only an accident .
it' s fine , it' s fine .
no harm , no foul , no bruise .
thank you so much .
you should be more careful , your royal highness .
somebody might try to take that away from you .
oh , i hope not .
but thank you so much for all your help .
someone like me .
welcome back to " eggs with elsie .
i' m elsie kentworthy , and today' s topic is princess mia .
hi .
how' s it going ?
so sorry , i thought i was alone .
no , miss .
i' m brigitte , if it pleases you .
at your service .
and i' m brigitta , miss .
brigitte and brigitta , i' m mia .
and , please , you don' t ...
don' t curtsy like that .
not like this ?
how do you like it , then ?
like this , maybe ?
no , no , no , i didn' t mean , like , you know ...
no , no , not that way .
i didn' t mean it , um ...
the queen bids you good morning , princess .
she' s in session with parliament .
ok .
i see you' ve met your lady' s maids .
yeah .
um ...
how do you turn off the curtsies ?
oh .
enough bowing .
back to your chores .
her majesty will meet you in one hour at the throne room .
ok .
i' m sorry your suite isn' t ready yet .
but you' re welcome to stay here in her majesty' s suite ...
no , no , no , no , it' s fine .
it' s ...
hey , can i explore the palace a little bit ?
of course .
oh .
well , you' ve met maurice .
hey , mo .
the throne room , in an hour .
the parliament of genovia is in session .
prime minister motaz presiding .
viscount mabrey , you have the floor .
monsieur mabrey , s' il vous plait .
as we all know , the 21 st birthday of an heir to the genovian bloodline is indeed a matter of great public significance .
it signifies that this young person is eligible to assume the crown .
indeed , we are well aware of this , viscount .
the queen has already indicated that princess mia intends to learn more at her side before assuming the throne .
it was not princess mia to whom i was referring .
oh , wow .
king chevalier was the great great great grandfather of ...
hello ?
ah ...
oh .
proceed .
nice .
hello ?
so .
as of the 20th of october last year , on the occasion of his 21 st birthday , another genovian of the royal bloodline became eligible to assume the throne .
what ?
my nephew , lord devereaux .
i beg your pardon ?
my nephew' s mother was my wife' s sister .
therefore , your majesty , i am pleased to say that my nephew is ready to take his place as genovia' s rightful king .
shut up .
i beg your pardon ?
i mean ...
" shut up " doesn' t always mean shut up .
taisez vous " veut dire ...
in america , it' s like " oh , my , " " gee whiz , " " wow .
" fantastique , " " superbe , " " oy vey .
yeah , thank you , mr. prime minister .
but isn' t princess mia first in line to ascend the throne ?
not yet .
genovian law states that a princess must marry before she can take the throne .
we have never enforced that law .
a man doesn' t have to marry to be king .
i mean , this is the 21 st century , for heaven' s sake .
my granddaughter should be given the same rights as any man .
yeah !
genovia shall have no queen lest she be bound in matrimony .
lord palimore ?
that is the law of genovia for the last 300 years .
princess mia is not qualified to rule because she is unmarried .
forgive me , your majesty .
not all of us are sure that the princess is the most suitable choice to govern our great nation .
ooh !
now , now , gentlemen , gentlemen .
please .
i suggest this honored body allow princess mia one year , during which time she must marry , or she forfeits the throne of genovia to young lord devereaux .
what ?
no .
i object .
i object most strongly .
one year ?
60 days .
two months .
60 days ?
30 days .
how could parliament expect me to fall in love in 30 days ?
it' s like ...
it' s like it' s a big trick to get me to have an arranged marriage , or ...
no .
no , there' s no ...
that' s it , there' s no " or . " there' s ...
i ...
an arranged marriage is my only choice .
what kind of person agrees to an arranged marriage ?
uh ...
you agreed to an arranged marriage .
right .
yes , i did .
and it turned out quite splendidly .
he was my best friend .
i' m sure , grandma , but ...
i dream of love , not fondness .
but you don' t have to do this , mia .
you don' t have to become queen .
this is so unfair .
amelia .
courage is not the absence of fear , but rather the judgment that something else is more important ... than fear .
there are 550 years of renaldis on these walls .
and i will be up there next to my father .
i' m sure i want my chance to make a difference as a ruler .
spoken like a true queen .
you , my boy , a true born genovian .
you should be our king .
i agree .
but how can we make it happen ?
give me one of your arrows .
i' m going to show you a trick that i learned from an old italian philosopher .
niccol machiavelli .
i can make this dart hit the bull' s eye every time .
yes , but that is cheating .
you' ve got it .
lord devereaux will be arriving shortly , mrs. kout , with his snake of an uncle .
yes , your majesty .
your majesty .
hm ?
i know lionel is the prime minister' s nephew and he' s interning for the summer because he wants to learn about security .
but he never leaves my side .
he sticks to me like velcro , madam .
it won' t last very long .
he returns to school in the autumn .
he wants an audience with you .
what , now ?
now .
lionel ?
short .
i don' t know if you' ve met mrs. kout , our housekeeper , and priscilla and olivia , my lady' s maids .
i' m doing a background check on olivia .
oh , that' s not necessary , lionel .
everybody in this room has high priority clearance .
of course , of course .
your majesty ?
hm ?
i would gladly take a bullet for you .
oh , how brave .
most interns don' t even want to fetch me my tea .
the limousine is at the gates , madam .
the viscount is not staying , just the nephew .
joseph , i want you to protect him and keep your eye on him at all times .
of course .
lionel .
oh , hello .
so is this all right to welcome the viscount and his nephew ?
very appropriate .
and pretty .
oh , i can' t believe parliament invited the guy who' s trying to steal the throne to stay here with us at the palace .
oh , no , parliament didn' t invite him .
i did .
wha ...
i offered to have him hung by his toes in our courtyard .
excuse me .
yeah , what about joe' s suggestion , huh ?
no .
if there' s any mischief going on , i' d prefer it be right under my nose .
it' s not a very difficult job , you know .
you just have to open the door before the passenger dies of old age .
hello , i' m here to welcome you .
your staff is incompetent and unreliable .
i just so don' t want to be nice to this guy , you know ?
i mean , he is rude , he' s arrogant , self centered , he' s ...
ah , well , have you met him ?
no .
neither have i.
yeah , but he probably is , grandma .
i mean ...
like , now , all of a sudden , out of nowhere , he wants to be the king of genovia ?
what is that about ?
oh , tush .
whatever he is , we will be charm itself .
we will present ourselves with grace and poise .
announcing viscount mabrey and lord devereaux .
your majesty .
your highness .
mabrey .
ma' am , may i introduce my nephew , lord nicholas devereaux .
nicholas .
we are delighted to make your acquaintance .
your majesty , the pleasure is all mine .
and thank you so much for inviting me to stay at the palace .
may i present my granddaughter mia .
your highness .
mia , would you care to welcome our guest ?
lord nicholas .
she always does that .
uh ...
i will personally get some ice for that foot , and i' il be with you as quickly as i possibly can .
an accident .
of course .
she' s training to be a flamenco dancer .
would you care to explain what was going on out there ?
sorry .
i , uh , have met lord nicholas , actually .
yep .
at the ball .
didn' t know who he was , so , you know , we ...
we danced , and i flirted .
i feel so stupid right now .
i see .
well , as your queen i absolutely cannot condone it .
as a grandma , i say , " right on .
now , if you' il come with me , i have something to show you .
oh , yeah .
i think you could leave that right there .
uh ...
yeah .
thank you , culinary people .
i' il be back .
the renovations for your suite are finally finished .
should have been ready for you when you arrived , but unfortunately we asked rupert' s cousin to do the bathroom .
it' s a good lesson .
nepotism belongs in the arts , not in plumbing .
this is your very own suite .
are you serious ?
this is ...
mm hm .
this is my room ?
yes .
oh , grandma .
this is very nice .
good .
we just made the bed .
this is so cool .
ah , fat louie .
i think he rather likes his new abode as well .
there' s more .
is that mine ?
why don' t you go and find out ?
ok .
i have my own mall .
ooh , very nice shoes .
i' m glad you like it .
try pressing button number three .
oh .
they' re charming .
i love these .
what do you think ?
grandma ?
i' m here .
oh , hello .
ooh , love that .
this is ...
now press combination 656 .
656 .
um ...
they' re a little ... gorgeous .
i had a selection of the crown jewels brought out for you .
they' re yours to borrow , with great discretion , at appropriate times .
now for the best surprise of all .
wow .
gorgeous , grandma .
but kind of a letdown after the jewels , i' m not gonna lie ...
you' re here .
i know i' m here .
you' re in genovia .
i know .
you' re in my closet .
you' re blonde .
i' m blonde .
i' m so glad to see you .
i think this is as good a moment as any to bow out .
i think i' il let you two ladies catch up with each other .
i can' t believe you' re here .
when did your flight get in ?
just a little while ago .
oh .
by the way ...
i' m getting married .
to who ?
i don' t know .
baron johann klimt .
no , not appropriate .
he' s a compulsive gambler .
yes .
oh , yes , i , i , i , i absolutely accept .
prince william .
he' s not eligible , because he' s in line for his own crown .
oh .
if he' s not eligible , why is he included in these pictures ?
i just love to look at him .
mm .
me too .
mm mm .
your majesty .
next .
antoine suisson of paris .
uh huh .
plays the harp .
no title , but good family .
what about the title " husband " ?
yeah , he' s cute .
mm .
his boyfriend thinks he' s handsome also .
right on .
no matter .
put him on all the invitation lists .
he' s a divine dancer .
next .
too old .
too young .
does this popcorn taste like pears ?
mm .
genovian specialty .
arrested too many times .
wait , no .
we need someone titled , someone who can help you run a country without ego getting in the way .
someone attractive , smart , but not arrogant .
someone with compassion .
someone like him ?
yes .
someone very much like him .
good choice , mia .
i wonder i didn' t think of him before .
andrew jacoby .
duke of kenilworth .
aw .
well , he looks ... decent .
he was an olympic swimmer , rides motorcycles , loves photography , and he' s a pilot in the royal air force .
can i do that ?
no .
you ever take those shades off ?
no .
here we are at the breezy seashore village of mertz .
and our two lovers have perfect weather for their first public outing .
along with andrew' s parents , susan and arnold .
must be rather hard to get to know each other this way .
oh , they' re waving at us .
my ...
oh .
oh , wait , wait , wait .
wait , mia .
a princess should not run for a scarf .
i got it .
shall we have some tea ?
your scarf , ma' am .
why , thank you , sir .
i think you might be clumsier than me .
oh , good shot .
oh .
no , no , let them bond .
let them bond .
the glasses .
off .
i' m coming , princess .
i' m coming , i' m coming , princess .
oh , ow .
oh , there you go .
ah .
ah .
they were smitten
while playing badminton
where' s my kitten
i want a little
something more
don' t want the middle
or the one before
i don' t desire
a complicated past
i want a love that will last
every marriage in my family for the past 200 years has been arranged ...
andrew ?
yes ?
could you try to talk without moving your lips ?
the ... the readers have binoculars .
here we find our favorite new royal couple , nestled under genovia' s famous pear tree .
and i have something for you .
oh , you don' t have to get me anything .
no , my birthday was last week , and ...
mia .
here you go .
cool .
you know , film .
that' s nice .
it' s ...
what is that ?
is that ...
it' s a film canister .
what' s in the film canister ?
what' s in it ?
why don' t you open it ?
you' il see .
oh , ok .
oh .
it was my great grandmother' s engagement ring .
she and my great grandfather were married for 57 years .
so i ...
i felt it could be lucky for us , maybe .
do i have to put it on myself ?
no , i could do that .
ok .
yes .
oh , my goodness .
it was a ring .
a royal proposal has been made .
fly the lovebirds .
you ready ?
if you are .
announcing the royal engagement of princess mia and andrew jacoby , duke of kenilworth .
here , just like the princess .
uncle , i hate to say this , but you were wrong .
princess mia has managed to find a husband within a week .
mia cannot possibly be happy with the idea of an arranged marriage .
your task is to romance her .
show her what a real relationship could be like .
a relationship filled with heat and passion .
and change her mind about andrew .
exactly .
and the 30 day deadline expires , and the throne is ours .
and you' re sure my father wanted this ?
it was his dearest wish .
help him , arthur .
one day he could be king .
i don' t recall him ever mentioning that to me .
well , you wouldn' t .
you were only six years old when he died .
but you do remember who he named you after , don' t you ?
yes .
grandfather nicholas .
no , no , no , no .
niccol machiavelli .
power , my boy , means never having to say you' re sorry .
here , kitty kitty kitty .
come here , kitty kitty .
yes .
thank you .
thank you .
oh , your highness .
shh .
andrew' s plane just took off .
he said he' d call as soon as he arrives in london .
he won' t be gone long .
why are we whispering ?
i' m hiding from my lady' s maids .
but i' m fine , i' m fine .
are you having second thoughts ?
no .
actually , on the contrary .
i was just admiring my ring .
it was andrew' s grandmother' s .
you know , he really is so romantic .
well , if you' il excuse me , i really must go see to some wedding details .
i' m sorry , is there something you wanted to say to me ?
no , no .
you are the one who stomped on me with your big feet .
big feet ?
brigitte , i found her .
uh , brigitta .
i' m not here .
it wasn' t her .
it was a ghost .
whoo ...
well , you know , you danced with my big feet .
fine .
i danced with you .
call the hague , convene the war crimes tribunal .
mia , i would remind you that we only danced for about a minute .
it was more than a minute .
well , maybe a minute and a half .
fine .
it was a minute and a half , but it was also a lie , because you didn' t tell me who you were and that you were trying to steal my crown .
please pardon me , i just had a momentary lapse of good manners .
you see , usually , when i ask a woman to dance , i always show her my family tree .
oh .
well , aren' t you just ... crafty .
let' s look in the ballroom .
the ballroom ?
i don' t think she' s in the ballroom .
well .
do you want to know what else you were doing , while you were doing your little lie dance ?
lie dance ?
the ballroom ?
yeah , that is exactly what you did .
what is a lie dance ?
i' il go look in the ballroom myself .
all right .
the lie dance is not the point .
the point is that ...
what is the point ?
i ...
the point is that i' m onto you .
oh boy , am i onto what you are trying to do .
and what am i trying to do ?
i think we both know exactly what that is .
oh , oh .
please forgive the intrusion , your highness , lord devereaux .
no , you don' t ...
uh ...
i' m told this lord devereaux boy is a native genovian .
recently graduated cambridge , gourmet cook , plays polo and rugby , and is known as quite a ladies ' man .
she was in a closet ?
with him .
yes .
does she have the makings of a queen ?
well , she' s young , but i' ve always believed in her .
she and andrew make a fine pair , i think .
yes , they do .
she' s very set on it , you know .
clarisse , my dear .
forget the wedding for a moment .
in less than a month , you will no longer be queen , and i will no longer be your head of security .
i think it' s time we bring our friendship out of the shadows .
oh , joseph , i ...
yes .
yes , my dear .
i would kneel if it weren' t for my knee replacement .
joseph , there' s a wedding to be planned .
mia needs to win over the people of genovia , all in less than 30 days .
perhaps it' s time to consider the duty you have to yourself .
oh .
clarisse ...
my darling , please think about it .
please .
i will .
dear diary .
my queen lessons continue .
surprise , surprise .
to fulfill one genovian tradition , i must learn to shoot a flaming arrow through a ceremonial ring , which will happen on the eve of my coronation .
it' s symbolic for lighting my own eternal flame .
we all want a holiday
let' s take a little time for a getaway
it' s all good , and better still
we can go crazy and you know we will
we' il have fun in the sun
everybody wants some
yeah , yeah
fun in the sun

the sparrow is flying .
sorry , i' m sorry .
i am almost in time though .
ok , sorry , got it , i got it .
you know what ?
i' m ok .
i' m fine .
so ...
what are we learning today ?
we are learning the art of the fan .
fascinating .
yes .
get up .
get up .
we only have about ten minutes in which to communicate this .
now , first of all , one handles a fan very deliberately .
it' s a tremendous tool of communication .
that' s it .
you can say things like , " i' m feeling flirtatious .
come hither .
you can say , " i never wish to speak to you again .
go away .
you can say , " i' m feeling terribly shy today .
pert as a schoolgirl well can be
filled to the brim with girlish glee
three little maids from school
everything is a source of fun
and you ...
are you sassing your grandma ?
i would never sass you , grandma .
this is also a way of showing you' re annoyed .
we will have somebody come and visit your farm in the morning , and perhaps we can repair the well and save your field .
this is for your table .
thank you .
thank you , your majesty .
you do this so well .
they just adore you .
it' s part of an ancient genovian tradition .
one has to be fair and very honest .
even if you can' t help , you have to show the people you care .
citizen jacqueline grenough .
we will review your scholarship application , and someone will be in touch no later than the end of next week .
oh , merci , your majesty .
here is a melon for your table .
oh , merci , jacqueline .
c' est gentil .
citizen tiny duval .
your majesty .
bonjour , tiny .
may i present my granddaughter , princess mia .
princess mia .
monsieur .
thank you for seeing me today .
something for your table .
thank you .
she' s my favorite .
i hope you like omelets .
may i ?
of course .
be careful .
aw , it' s a chicken .
careful .
we have a chicken situation in the throne room .
mia .
yeah ?
a princess never chases a chicken .
dear diary .
tomorrow my stress level goes to 11 , as i review the royal guard .
the whole court will be watching , plus the troops .
and i' m wearing a floor length dress .
i also have to be ladylike while riding sidesaddle .
hah !
i can' t ride sidesaddle .
no , no , no .
i couldn' t ride sidesaddle either when i was your age , and frankly , dear , it is acutely uncomfortable .
herbie is my riding companion .
here he is .
herbie .
it' s a wooden leg .
yes .
that is impressively sneaky , grandma .
did you come up with this on your own ?
oh , no , it' s a centuries old idea .
and you put the riding boot on it ...
exactly .
our ancestors knew a thing or two , right ?
you just drape your skirt over it and nobody suspects a thing .
hear ye , hear ye .
princess amelia mignonette thermopolis renaldi reviews the royal guard of genovia .
now , the last time we spoke , you mentioned that princess mia' s horse ,
sandy , gets easily spooked by snakes .
so let' s get it really spooked , shall we ?
this is a fake snake .
oh , you' re very observant .
a regular david attenborough .
that' s rubber , yes .
but it will spook the horse .
i' m nick .
viscount mabrey' s nephew .
ah , the chap who' s trying to stage the palace coup .

no wonder she' s so clumsy .
she' s got a wooden leg .
talk about getting off on the wrong foot .
the ceremony has officially ended .
you shouldn' t hide .
it only makes them gossip more .
what do you want ?
just think , mia .
one more leg and you could' ve easily outrun your horse .
i don' t need this right now .
mia , i' m ...
i' m sorry , i ...
no , you' re not .
you never think about anyone but yourself .
so just this once , can you please let me be miserable , and not make me feel worse about myself ?
just go away .
go away , go away ...
mia ...
princess , excuse me .
the queen has arrived .
yes .
nicholas .
am i going to be disappointed in you ?
unfortunate incident , that .
i' m just leaving .
you going to come and see me off ?
i' d like to speak with your uncle alone , nicholas .
please .
viscount .
you may not be aware of what my job entails as the royal head of security .
my job is to protect the crown , to make sure no harm comes to the crown .
to step in when someone toys with the crown' s emotions , you see .
i think the entire country understands how well you cater for the crown' s emotions .
if you hurt my girl , you will answer directly to me .
i have diplomatic immunity in 46 countries .
including puerto rico .
sir , you will find that the word " fear " is not in my vocabulary .
perhaps .
but it' s in your eyes .
you forgot something .
au revoir , pierre , et merci beaucoup .
trs bien , majest .
nicholas , i ...
i want to ask you a question .
of course , your majesty .
why are you so against princess mia being queen ?
well , my uncle feels that princess mia doesn' t know the people .
and you feel you do know the people ?
yes .
i was born here , i went to primary school here .
i am a true genovian .
mia didn' t even know she was genovian until high school , and to be frank , she' s spent little time here since then .
well , i happen to feel that she' il make a great ruler .
she' s terribly bright , sensitive , caring .
i know that .
you do ?
yes .
yes , i do .
but ...
how can one rule the people if they do not know the people ?
touch .
that' s a very good question .
opera' s new rising star , anna netrebko .
looks good enough to eat .
how are your grandchildren , lily , charlotte and sam ?
they' re wonderful .
thank you for remembering .
how are you ?
good to see you .
how' s your dachshund ?
maury , right ?
he is great .
you remember him from last summer ?
mia' s doing well .
some major mingling , i see .
a little higher , olivia .
mia .
did you happen to see who' s here ?
who ?
the king wannabe with lady elissa .
oh .
is she his ... girlfriend ?
nicholas doesn' t have girlfriends , he has dates .
but attractive ones .
you talk to him much ?
uh ...
we acknowledge each other .
andrew ?
yes , dear .
coming .
yuck .
well , the camera' s all ready to go , so ... all right .
let' s go this way .
no more straggling for me .
you did very well , mia .
very charming .
oh , thank you .
wait , wait , wait .
the light is perfect .
what ?
just one more , please .
please , no more pictures .
come on , please .
one more .
it' s very flattering , but ...
mia , one more picture ...
ah .
hello .
i' m andrew jacoby .
oh , hello .
lady elissa .
pleasure .
lady elissa .
your highness .
hello .
elissa and i were just discussing her latest achievement .
she' s received a rhodes scholarship .
nicholas , please .
why not brag ?
you' re an amazing woman .
elissa , congratulations .
you know , andrew has a phd in anthropology from oxford .
oh , really ?
that' s wonderful .
fantastic .
elissa was in the peace corps .
really ?
andrew spent four months in papua new guinea studying the bark of a yam tree .
elissa single handedly ...
andrew ...
elissa is actually trying to say something .
yes , lady elissa ?
andrew , would you like to get a drink ?
i have a feeling they' re going to start a " my horse is bigger than your horse " run .
i would absolutely love to .
excuse us .
you know , her horse actually is very huge .
oh , really ?
yes ...
fantastic party .
it is .
you two make such a lovely couple .
we do .
thanks .
it' s a shame you' re not attracted to him .
i know , it ...
you ...
i ...
come back here .
ladies and gentlemen , a special treat for our friends from asia .
jonny blu .
come back here .
you ... you can' t just say something like that and walk away .
i will have you know that i am very attracted to andrew .
well , obviously .
i am .
he' s ...
we are perfect for each other .
he understands me ...
understands you ?
wow .
what passion .
i didn' t hear you mention love .
you are so jealous .
why would i be jealous of andrew ?
he' s got to spend the rest of his life married to you .
i loathe you .
i loathe you .
i loathed you first .
wait .
what are you doing ?
what is wrong with you ?
you can' t just go around kissing people .
particularly not engaged people .
you enjoyed it .
you want to kiss again ?
well , i ...
no !
stop trying to confuse me .
what' s confusing about a kiss ?
you' re just trying to make me like you so that i won' t want to marry andrew and so that you can have the crown .
oh !
well , maybe i am , and ... maybe i just like kissing you .
you ...
you stay away from me .
mia ...
you know what ?
i have an idea .
i have a brilliant idea .
why don' t you go underwater and i' il count to a million ?
mia , careful ...
mia .
do i want to know ?
i don' t think so .
i' il be two seconds , mia .
she' s going to be a handful , isn' t she ?
you' il never be bored , andrew .
yes .
olivia , enough goodbyes .
yes , ma' am .
eagle is leaving !
eagle is leaving !
in hushed tones , lionel .
hushed tones .
when are you going to start acting responsibly ?
hiding in a closet with a man who is not your betrothed ?
coming out of a fountain dripping wet with the same man , who is not your betrothed ?
do you think i plan for this kind of stuff to happen ?
i lost it .
sometimes you just lose it .
you can' t afford to lose it .
other people lose it .
we' re supposed to find it .
people look up to us , and we' re held to higher standards of behavior .
can you try to grasp that concept ?
the concept is grasped .
the execution is a little elusive .
oh , i would say so .
try to get some sleep .
you' il want to look fresh for the parade tomorrow .
good night .
good night , grandmother .
well , maurice , it' s just you and i.
or are you upset with me too ?
royal guard of genovia , fall in .
big parade day .
identify , mustang personnel .
why do you talk like that ?
i' m captain kip kelly of the royal guard .
what if we all talked like that ?
lilly moscovitz , best friend of princess mia , riding in the ' stang .
that was very nicely done , miss lilly .
it' s a pleasure to meet you .
hi .
the prettiest girl is riding in the ' stang .
flag ?
thank you .
flag ?
welcome .
welcome , viscount mabrey .
may i offer you a flag ?
thank you , i am not a waving aficionado .
but i will wave our national flag when a true genovian king once again sits on the throne .
king nicholas .
flag ?
how do you feel today , my dear ?
honestly , joe , not that great .
well , would you feel better if you called me joey ?
no , joe .
good .
come on , joseph .
we' re already late .
her majesty is ready .
can' t keep the people of genovia waiting any longer .
