it' il be so different this christmas / won' t it / luther ?
yes / it will be so different .
nothing will be the same .
for the first time in 23 years / blair won' t be here .
might even get depressing .
lot of depression at christmas / you know ?
yeah / well ....
i would just love to forget about it .
what are you looking at ?
why are you looking at me like that ?
finish your pasta .
i' m finished with my pasta .
it' s you i' m not finished with .
i' il be right back .
you wait right there .
okay .
luther ?

i have an idea .
yeah ?
a brilliant idea .
make sure you shut the curtains .
all right .
come over here .
turn around .
what are you doing ?
sit down .
button up and sit down .
look at this .
this is a little ledger of what we spent last year for christmas .
look at some of this stuff .
what is this / $63 for ornament repair ?
you got to be kidding me .
look at the total .
we spent $6/ 100 on christmas last year . $6/ 100 on
i heard you the first time .
with precious little to show for it .
where is this going ?
the caribbean .
a 10 day luxury cruise on the jubilee .
the most luxurious ship in their fleet .
cayman lslands .
snorkeling .
we go to jamaica .
we windsurf / whatever the heck that is .
look at the picture here .
the bahamas .
we sit in the sun .
10 days / luxury cruise / you and me .
i might have to lose a little weight .
heck / i' il lose it for you .
what' s the catch ?
i wouldn' t call it a catch .
we skip christmas .
we skip christmas ?
we skip christmas / save the money / and spend it on us for a change .
i don' t know .
come on / please .
you and i go bask in the caribbean sun .
how much is this gonna cost ? $3/ 000 .
we save money ?
absolutely .
we can still give our charitable donations ... to children' s hospital and / of course / the church .
no / this is a total boycott / honey .
total .
it' s $600 .
it' s a total boycott .
i' m afraid that' s all i' m gonna say about that .
well / then / no .
what a stupid idea .
you' re gonna let a lousy $600 stand between us and a caribbean cruise .
no .
you are .
all right / look .
i' il match last year' s contribution to the church and to the hospital ... but not a penny more .
when do we leave ?
high noon / christmas day .
it' s not even saturday night .
i will not be celebrating christmas this year .
as many of you know / blair has joined ... the peace corps .
so nora and i have decided to avoid the rituals of christmas ... save our money / and take a cruise .
therefore , i will not be participating in the usual holiday rituals .
i will buy no gifts and accept none .
thank you , anyway .
i will not attend the firm' s black tie christmas dinner ... nor will i be here for the office party .
i am not angry and i will not yell ... " humbug " at anyone who offers me a holiday greeting .
i am simply skipping christmas .
hello / mrs. krank .
hello / aubie / how are you ?
i' m just a little worried about your christmas cards .
why are you worried ?
you always select the most beautiful cards .
you really should put your order in .
we' re not gonna be ordering christmas cards this year .
do what ?
you heard me .
may i ask why not ?
you know / i' m really quite late for lunch .
bye bye .
say hi to your mom .
but we always have a live band at the auction .
yeah / but last year / the band cost $15/ 000 .
we hired a deejay for the cancer ball .
ladies .
hi / aubie .
hello .
mrs. krank / we forgot to talk about your christmas invitations .
we won' t be needing those / either .
no party ?
no christmas eve party ?
no party this year .
she' s not ordering christmas cards either .
what' s up ?
we' re ... taking a break .
we' re not gonna do christmas this year .
how do you simply not do christmas ?
you skip it .
but then what do we do christmas eve ?
you' il think of something .
there are plenty of other parties .
but none like yours .
that' s sweet .
when do you leave ?
christmas day .
that' s an odd time to travel .
apparently / not that many people travel on december 25th ... and so luther got us a great deal .
then why don' t you have the party anyway ?
because we don' t want to / merry .
we' re taking a break .
one year off / no christmas whatsoever .
what do we do ?
i don' t know .
mr. krank / i' m randy scanlon .
we' re selling christmas trees again this year .
got yours right here .
you got a canadian blue spruce last year .
this one' s a real beauty .
almost 10 feet tall .
mrs. krank likes the big ones .
aren' t they cute ?
how much is the big one ? $90 .
we had to go up a little .
we' re not buying a christmas tree this year .
luther .
we talked about this .
sorry we had to go up on the price .
we' re making less per tree than last year .
it' s not about the money .
we' re not doing christmas this year .
we' re gonna go away on a cruise .
we don' t need a tree .
all right .
well / out of the frying pan ... and into the fire .
luther .
what ?
come here .
why ?
come here .
what are they doing ?
who ?
spilling their guts to frohmeyer .
not frohmeyer .
are you intimidated by vic frohmeyer ?
honey / he' s like the unelected ward boss of the street .
so frohmeyer has a problem with our skipping christmas ?
who' s he gonna call ?
the three wise men ?
santa claus ?
don' t underestimate him / honey .
vic frohmeyer lives and breathes for this neighborhood .
you should' ve just bought the tree .
no .
you didn' t have to put it up .
no .
you could' ve left it in the backyard .
quiet .
why are you whispering ?
this is our house .
i' m whispering for the same reason you' re hiding behind that curtain .
hey / walt .
luther krank just stiffed the scouts on a christmas tree .
can you believe that / mr. frohmeyer ?
do not put it up there .
i want them on the back of the house .
move it to the right .
the other right .
becker' s at it again .
evening / vic .
everybody' s going to really miss blair this year .
the whole block' s talking about it .
how is she doing ?
she' s doing just fine .
thanks for asking .
how' s your family ?
ln great spirits .
we' re putting up decorations tonight .
wind it tight / spike !
hi / dad !
looks good / mama !
it' s the greatest time of year / don' t you think ?
i couldn' t be happier .
it' s not gonna be the same without blair here .
of course not .
honey / are you okay ?
come here .
honey !
give me a hand .
there are certain things around here that i' m gonna miss at christmas .
so you' re ... really skipping out ?
you got it .
somehow / it just doesn' t seem right .
that' s really not up to you to decide / is it ?
but i got to tell you / the neighbors are pretty upset .
really ?
christmas has always been a neighborhood thing around here .
you know that .
everybody decorates .
everybody bakes cookies / and swaps gifts .
i guess we do it for the kids .
lf you' re trying to make me feel guilty / get off of it .
and you know what else ?
i' d appreciate it if you ... and everyone else around here would just respect my wishes .
whatever you say / luther .
weather should be clear tomorrow .
perfect time to put up frosty .
frosty ?
tell you what / truth is / if i' m gone / i' m ....
vic ?
frosty is a christmas tradition .
frosty is a christmas decoration .
i will not be told by vic frohmeyer that i have to decorate my house for christmas .
why won' t you put up frosty ?
it' s the principle thing .
do you understand ?
we can forget about christmas if we damn well choose .
and nobody / not even vic frohmeyer / can stop us .
i will not be forced into doing this .
have a good day .
hi / nora .
morning / bev .
hi / walt .
hey / nora !
it was an accident .
walt / why don' t you put that cat of yours on a leash ?
only dogs wear leashes / old man .
think you can run away from christmas ?
i' m trying to .
guess it' s a good way to save money .
it' s not about the money .
yeah / sure .
muffles / be polite .
will you two ever be friends ?
you know / i' d like to say yes / but ....
how you feeling today / bev ?
have my good days and bad days .
today' s a good day .
i' m glad to hear that .
come have your breakfast / dear .
i got to get to work .
still working for the man / huh ?
as a matter of fact / it is a man i work for .
thought they would' ve made you partner by now .
i got to get to work .
have a good one / old man .
one snowball with a little yellow spot on it .
just skim the top of that little head of his .
just like that .
old man .
bah / humbug .
good morning / mr. scrooge .
morning / dox .
do i have any messages ?
wal mart called .
said i had to buy my own cheap perfume since santa claus isn' t coming this year .
funny .
nora krank !

they can' t have him .
nora !

honey / where is frosty ?
he' s down behind the furnace .

we' il put him up for you .
they said they' il put him up for us .
absolutely not .
please / luther .
no !
we' il come back later .
and frosty better be here .
they' re gonna come back !
listen to you .
you' re panicking on the phone in a locked house ... because the neighbors are going door to door ... to set up a ridiculous 7 foot tall snowman !
sure / easy for you to say .
miles away in the safety of your office .
yeah / well
i am the one trapped here .
i am the one dealing with this !
all right / i agree .
so maybe it' s time that you left the neighborhood .
sure / honey .
how do you think i' m gonna do that ?
the street is blocked with all of our neighbors .
walk to the garage / get in the car / start it / drive to the mall ...
i' il meet you at o' leary' s .
do it now !
you can do this !
do it before
bit more to the left .
that looks good .
hi / mrs. krank .

vic / she' s leaving !
what' s she doing ?
i' m so sorry .
sorry !
nora / stop the car .
stop the car .

shut your eyes .
all right / open them .
honey / is this some kind of joke ?
no / i got one / too .

a woman' s bathing suit ?
probably belongs with that .
nope / got my own .
look at that .
little cliff diver thing .
honey / there is no way we are wearing these on this cruise .
these aren' t for the cruise .
you know what' s odd ?
ls when an lrish pub serves fish tacos .
i don' t get that .
i got a little heartburn .
i don' t think i' m gonna do that again .
here it is / right here .
come on .
follow me / and don' t mention her eyes .

this is my wife / nora .
hello .
i really don' t want to do this .
no / come on .
i got a great deal . $60 / 1 2 visits .
why would we get a tan before the cruise ?
i thought the whole point was to get a tan during the cruise .
look at our skin .
we kind of look like uncooked chicken .
you look like a corpse .
and you could use a little help yourself .
thank you .
dear god / this should be outlawed .
okay / calm down .
excuse me .
excuse me .
hello !
i need a band ald .
nora krank ?
father zabriskie .

" skipping christmas .
yep .
the home of mr. and mrs. luther krank is rather dark this christmas .
while their neighbors on hemlock street are decorating and preparing for santa ...
the kranks are skipping christmas .
they' re preparing for a cruise / according to unnamed sources .
no tree / no lights / and no frosty up on the roof ...
and the only house on hemlock to keep frosty in the basement .
how do they know where frosty is ?
they have spies everywhere .
hemlock / a frequent winner in the gazette street decoration contest ...
finished a disappointing sixth this year . " ' i hope they' re satisfied now / ' complained one unidentified neighbor . " ' a rotten display of selfishness / ' said another .
who said that ?
could' ve been anybody .
how dare they !
what a bunch of losers .
you know what ?
you know / i don' t think i' m coming back from this cruise .
attagirl .
two more days and we' re out of here .
two more / baby .
jerks .
chocolate milk ?
sure .
that' s mine .
regular .
sorry i' m late .
hey .
what' s wrong ?
it' s bev scheel .
could you cover for me ?
sure .
what happened ?
she went for a checkup yesterday .
the cancer' s back for the third time .
has it spread ?
they think so .
that' s awful .
this could be her last christmas .
sweetheart .
well / if it isn' t old scrooge himself .
how do you think this photographer got this shot ?
what photographer ?
the one that took this photograph .
that one .
yeah / that one .
he climbed up .
on your roof ?
yeah .
why did you do that ?
i don' t know .
he said he wanted to get a shot of the whole street .
at least you' re consistent .
i try to be / old man .
stop that .
stop what ?
stop calling me " old man .
you' re / like / 10 years older than me .
am l ?
yeah .

walt .
i just heard about bev .

thanks .
i really appreciate that .
they' re here for frosty .
no .
i' il get it .
thank you .
good evening / mr. krank .
good evening / officers .
it' s that time of year again .
your police benevolent association' s out there raising money for the community .
that' s great .
you know / toys for tots / and we deliver gift baskets for the underprivileged .
and ice skating for handicapped kids .
every year / we deliver presents for the elderly at the nursing homes ... and / of course / our war veterans .
our big moneymaker is our calendar ... and you buy one every year / so here we are .
we don' t need a calendar this year .
what a jerk .
he said he didn' t need one .
thank you for your contribution .
merry christmas .
yeah / merry christmas .
good luck with it .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
we' re from st. maria' s lutheran church out caroling .
are those folks home ?
yes / they are .
are they jewish ?
no .
buddhist or anything ?
no / none of that .
they' re just trying to avoid christmas this year .
do what ?
you heard me .
he' s kind of weird .
skipping christmas so he can save his money for a cruise .
no .
i think some christmas cheer would do them good .
really ?
why don' t you go ahead ?
all righty then .
drop .
down !
go !
this is fun .
christmas carolers right out next to our junipers .
how lovely .
it' s not lovely .
they' re trespassing .
somebody set us up .
they' re not trespassing .
yes / they are .
they' re on our property .
they weren' t invited .
somebody told them to come .
scheel or frohmeyer .
christmas carolers are not trespassers .
i know what i' m talking about here .
why don' t you have them arrested / then ?
i just may do that .
call your friends down at the police department .
that' s funny .
not too late to buy a calendar .
this isn' t a joke .
this is military .
this is seal stuff .
i saw it on discovery channel .
come on .
just sit right here .
here you go .
right here .
there .
that' s perfect .
quietest room in the house .
no one can find us down here .
free frosty !
free frosty !
merry christmas / mrs. krank .
luther !
every who down in who ville liked christmas a lot .
but the grinch who lived just north of who ville did not .
the grinch hated christmas / the whole christmas season .
now / please don' t ask why / no one quite knows the reason .
it could be his head wasn' t screwed on just right .
it could be / perhaps / that his shoes were too tight .
but i think that the most likely reason of all ...
may have been that his heart was two sizes too small .
luther , your face .
what about it ?
it' s like it' s frozen or something .
this ?
i got a botox injection today .
botox treatment .
they take a big needle and they inject it into your forehead .
it freezes your face like this .
i read it in a health magazine .
how long are you gonna be like this ?
this is temporary .
and then you got all your wrinkles are gone .
you should try this .
you ought to get your money back .
i can' t live like this anymore .
what ?
we can' t go out .
everywhere we go / people are whispering behind our backs .
i can' t go home .
it' s too depressing .
i mean / there' s no tree and no lights and no music .
i can' t talk to you .
you' re just consumed with yourself .
that' s not true .
look how far you' ve gone .
amazing .
turning our lawn into an ice rink .
i can' t feel anything .
somebody could' ve broken their leg or their neck .
you could' ve put a caroler in the hospital .
and that would be a bad thing ?
i' m kidding .
i know this has been tough on you .
but in just one day / 24 hours / we' il be on that trip .
and it' s all gonna be better .
i promise .
i don' t know .
do you think that blair will even think about christmas ?
probably not .
i mean / she' s in the rainforest ... and around people who worship trees ... and eat bark and frogs and that sort of stuff .
you gonna wear that ?
absolutely .
nice .
free frosty !
i know this is you / spike .
goodbye .

because we are .
i need my vest .
i don' t know who' s coming to the party or what they' re gonna eat ... but we' re having a party .
what about our trip ?
don' t even start with me .
this was all your stupid idea .
stupid idea ?

don' t dwell on the past / lsland boy / we' re having a party .
cheese / wine and blairey' s favorite : hickory honey ham .

then you will get your little brown butt down to the basement and put up frosty .
no !
yes !
we are going to perform a little christmas miracle .
lf we pull it off / blairey is never gonna know ... about your stupid / ridiculous / childish scheme ... of skipping christmas .
i' m sorry about this little ugly bush .

sweetie / here they come .
here come the pros .
guys .
just hold on .
i guess you can' t / can you ?

that' s good .
over here / man .
folks / move back .

why should we do this for him ?
yeah .
he' s a jerk .
regardless of how you feel about him a lot of you have mixed feelings about him .
but we' re a community .
the people in a community stick together .
even if one of them has been behaving / for most of the holiday season ...
like a spoiled / selfish little baby .
we' re not doing this for him .
we' re doing this for blair .
blair / who used to baby sit all your kids .
blair / who comes home every summer and makes us all feel like family .
that' s right .
why should the daughter pay for the sins of the father ?
now / if we even have a hope of pulling this off / you got to scatter .
grab a change of clothes and all the food you can / and get over here in half an hour .
let' s go .
randy / mike / let' s go .
thank you !
you' re welcome / nora .
guys / better go to the airport .
why' s that ?
blair needs a ride home .
i don' t know if we could do that .

we could do that .
got a hold of frosty there ?
easy .
up he goes .
there you go .

you really have shown us the true meaning of community .
and thank you all so much .
merry christmas .
same goes for me / double .
cheers .
fellas / how about a party tune ?
g.
that was it ?
that was the best you could come up with ?
i' m not really good at toasts .
after all they' ve done ... you couldn' t just come up with a simple " thank you " ?
i did .
it was just short and sweet .
you' re still moping ... because you don' t get to go on your precious little cruise .
there' s still time .
what ?
we could still go .
listen to me .
enrique and blair can stay here / have the house to themselves .
we go / and we all have a romantic getaway .
your daughter just flew thousands of miles home ... with her very sweet future husband ... to spend christmas with us .
you know ...
i' ve spent six weeks planning for this vacation .
that' s longer than they' ve been dating .
everyone out there sacrificed their christmas eve to help us .
i thought maybe that might affect you .
maybe have you start thinking about putting others first instead of yourself .
but i really don' t think that' s possible .
it' s a shame .
why don' t we move in a little ?
hi / how are you ?
merry christmas to you .
it' s cold out there .
bravo !
luther !
frosty ?
merry christmas / luther .
merry christmas to you / too / walt .
you' re missing your party .
well / there' s ....
how' s bev ?
she' s having a good day .
yeah / thanks .
we started over to see blair / but / you know / the snow started and ....
so how' s the boyfriend ?
you know / actually / he' s a very nice young man .
merry christmas / luther .
merry christmas to you / too / bev .
you feeling okay ?
that was a pretty nasty fall .
it could' ve been worse .
i mean / that cord could' ve snapped and ....
you know / nora wanted me to drop this by .
i' m allergic to pork / and bev' s not much of a meat eater .
not to worry / because mel' s hams are generally just filled ... with a gelatin and a fat like substance .
please .
it' s very thoughtful / luther .
you know / have a good one .
could i come in for a minute ?
thanks .
blair' s gonna be staying with us for 10 days ... so we' re not taking the cruise .
and nora and i would like you guys to have it .
flight leaves at 1 2 : 00 noon tomorrow .
you got to be there two hours ahead of time .
it' s 10 days in the caribbean .
lslands and beaches .
the works .
it' s a dream vacation .
we can' t take it / luther .
it' s not right .
i didn' t purchase the travel insurance .
so if you don' t take it / the whole package is wasted .
i' m not sure my doctor would allow it .
i' ve got that lexon deal on the front burner .
benny said he might stop by tomorrow .
and we couldn' t leave the cat .
this is from us to you .
this is a sincere / heartfelt ... no strings attached christmas offering ... to two very selfless people who are / at this moment ... having a very difficult time looking for an excuse .
benny did say he might stop by .
face it / bev / benny hasn' t been home in years .
look / i' ve got everything right here .
i got airline tickets .
i got cruise passes .
i' ve got a brochure .
what' s it cost ? lf we decide to go / we' d want to reimburse you .
this is a simple gift / walt .
no costs / no payback .
don' t make it complicated .
our names aren' t on the tickets .
i know .
i' il take care of that .
what about the cat ?
yeah / that' s a problem / huh ?
too late to call the kennel .
we can' t just leave him .
we could ask jude becker .
she' s allergic .
i' il take the cat .
what ?
are you sure ?
yeah .
look at that .
see ?
maybe if you don' t step on him so often ....
yeah .
it' il be fine .
thank you so much .
merry christmas .
well / i should get back to my party .
this means so much .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
does this mean we have to start being nice to each other ?
of course not .
good .
because i still don' t like you that much / old man .
that' s good .
i' m not that fond of you / either .
bev / we gotta pack !
luther !
help me !
ned !
what in god' s name are you doing up there ?
blair came home .
frohmeyer took down the ladder .
he went inside / forgot about me .
have you been up there all this time ?
i' m frozen / stuck to frosty !
i' il get you down !

you swore on your kids ' lives !
what kids ?

let' s go .
you swore to me .
i' m growing tired of catching you .
what' s this all about ?
what' s going on ?
i told you you could use an umbrella .
what ?
marty .
yes .
wait .
you' re the guy that was selling the umbrellas in the rain / aren' t you ?
it' s a living .
i meet a lot of nice people this way .
i got to run because i can' t pass up this kind of weather .
it' s always good for business .
thank you for the party .
you' re welcome .
i' m sorry you got to work on christmas eve .
santa always has to work on christmas eve .
yeah / i suppose he does .
merry christmas !
bev scheel just called .
maybe i was wrong about you .
this night is full of surprises .

maybe next year .
merry christmas !
