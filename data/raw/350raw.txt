on my mark it will be fourplus three seven .
four , three , two one , mark .
cape com , this is chris .
i' m out .
everything looks ok .
good .
the manoeuvring unit works this time .
i used it to get out .
it makes things a lot easier .
cape com to hawaii , this is flight control , come in .
hawaii , roger .
hawaii , we expect to start eva over your station on this pass .
hawaii to jupiter 16 .
an unidentified object is closing on you fast from astern .
can you see it ?
hawaii , we have nothing here .
hold while we check the space track .
hawaii to jupiter 16 .
repeat , hawaii to jupiter 16 .
an unidentified object is on our scope .
we see nothing .
can you give me a bearing ?
appears to be coming up fast , from astern .
hey , now i see it .
it' s another spacecraft !
repeat , it' s another spacecraft !
does it looks like a close pass ?
you' re breaking up .
say again .
does it look like a close pass ?
chris , what' s happening ?
it' s coming right at us .
the front is opening up !
i repeat , the front is opening up !
it' s coming right at us .
chris , get back in , get back in !
do you read me ?
you' re breaking up .
repeat , you' re breaking up .
what' s happening ?
hawaii to jupiter 16 .
hawaii to jupiter 16 .
are you receiving ?
you' re breaking up .
come in , please .
jupiter 16 !
you' re breaking up ...
my lead line !
it' s cu ...
hawaii to jupiter 16 , hawaii to jupiter 16 .
are you receiving me ?
come in , please .
over .
hello , houston .
we' ve lost radio contact .
we' ve also lost him on the scope .
unidentified object is still orbiting .
alert all stations and track him closely .
it is ridiculous for the soviet government to deny responsibility .
the soviet government denies all knowledge of this affair .
the world knows we are a peace loving people .
i hereby give notice that in 20 days the united states will launch her next spaceship .
my government has instructed me to inform you that any interference with it will be regarded as an act of war .
may i ask what motive our russian friends would have for wishing to destroy american spacecraft ?
my government sees this as a blatant attempt to gain complete and absolute control of space itself for military purposes .
we don' t agree .
her majesty' s government is not convinced that this intruder missile originated from soviet russia .
our tracking station in singapore reported faint echoes of this craft coming down in the sea of japan area .
might i suggest that this is where you should concentrate your intelligence forces ?
the prime minister asked me to assure you this is what we propose to do .
as a matter of fact , our man in hong kong is working on it now .
why do chinese girls taste different from all other girls ?
you think we better ?
no , just different .
like peking duck is different from
russian caviar , but i love ' em both .
darling , i give you very best duck .
that would be lovely .
we' ve had some interesting times together , ling .
i' il be sorry to go .
take that door .
the bed !
we' re too late .
at least he died on the job .
he' d have wanted it this way .
we shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trump .
for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall all be changed .
we therefore commit his body to the deep to be turned into corruption ,
iooking for the resurrection of the body when the sea shall give up her dead .
present !
fire !
fire !
fire !
carry on .
aye aye , sir .
permission to come aboard ?
permission granted .
thank you .
take this officer aft .
yes , sir .
number one , take her up to 90ft .
course zero four five .
aye aye , sir .
hello , penny .
you' d better go right in .
you' re late as usual , even from your own funeral .
we corpses have no sense of timing .
in you go ... sir .
thank you ... ma' am .
sit down , 007 .
thank you , sir .
no ill effects ?
none at all , sir .
now you' re dead , perhaps some of your old friends will pay less attention to you .
give you more elbow room .
you' il need it , too .
this is the big one , 007 .
that' s why i' m out here .
you' re fully briefed ?
yes , but there' s one thing i don' t understand .
if our singapore tracking station is correct about the rocket not landing in russia , where did it land ?
we assume it' s japan .
all this is guesswork , but the pm wants us to play it with everything we' ve got .
and the aerial reconnaissance ?
all photographed .
nothing .
are the japanese equipped to launch such a rocket ?
we don' t think so .
then who else is ?
that' s what you' ve got to find out , and fast .
before the real shooting starts .
this damn thing could blow up into a full scale war .
when you get to tokyo , go to that name and address .
our man henderson will contact you there .
henderson .
captain here .
full ahead .
right .
that' s all .
thank you , sir .
007 .
sir ?
we' ve only three weeks to the next american launch .
you know that ?
yes , sir .
my sources tell me the russians are planning one even earlier .
so move fast , 007 .
yes , sir .
by the way , how was the girl ?
which girl ?
the chinese one we fixed you up with .
another five minutes , i' d have found out .
she' il never know what she missed .
miss moneypenny , give 007 the password we' ve agreed
with japanese sls .
yes , sir .
we tried to think of something you wouldn' t forget .
yes ?
i ...
iove ... you .
repeat it , please , to make sure you get it .
don' t worry , i get it .
sayonara .
james ... good luck .
instant japanese .
you may need it .
you forget , i took a first in oriental languages at cambridge .
stand by to load .
lift to the launch !
tube loaded .
hubcap open .
fire .
this is your ticket .
thank you .
dozo .
i love you .
i have a car nearby .
where do you suggest we go ?
i know a quiet hotel .
and ?
where your friend is waiting .
mr henderson .
wasn' t mr henderson able to come himself ?
i suppose not .
why ?
he didn' t say .
i think it' s about hotel time .
how long have you worked for henderson ?
long enough to learn not to discuss such matters with strangers .
mr henderson' s waiting for you .
you' re not coming in with me ?
mr henderson would like to see you alone .
do come in .
mr henderson ?
at your service .
i believe you wanted to ask me some questions .
yes .
excuse me .
thank you .
i' m glad you got it right .
i lost that in singapore in ' 42 .
you must excuse this rather odd mixture of styles , but i refuse to go entirely japanese .
very fond of some of these old things .
you' ve never been to japan before ?
no , never .
i myself have lived here for ... 28 years .
and i' m just beginning to know my way about .
your most vital contact will be tanaka .
tanaka ?
he' s head of the japanese secret service .
and his identity is the most closely guarded secret in japan .
when can i see him ?
you can see tiger tonight .
tiger ?
his closest friends are permitted to call him that .
do you have any leads of your own ?
yes , i do .
that' s stirred not shaken .
that was right ?
perfect .
cheers .
russian vodka .
well done .
yes , i get it from the doorman at the russian embassy .
amongst certain other things .
now , look .
i think london' s theory about the missile being fired from this country is right .
i don' t know how or where .
and don' t ask me who' s doing it either .
but i have a fairly shrewd idea that a major foreign power is behind it all .
you mean , apart from russia and japan ?
it' s not russia , old boy , i' m sure of that .
it' s not japan either .
although a large japanese industrial concern is ...
good evening .
cheers .
siamese vodka ?
there he is !
freeze !
get in , quick !
what the hell' s the score ?
what do you mean ?
my job is to help you .
like you helped henderson ?
i' m taking you to a place of safety .
no , this time i' m taking you .
i want some information now .
i have no information to give you .
we' il see about that .
slow down .
welcome .
welcome to japan , mr bond .
it is a great pleasure to meet you at last .
and how do you like our country so far ?
i am a trifle disappointed at the ease with which i could pull you in .
the one thing my honourable mother taught me long ago was never to get into a car with a strange girl .
but you , i' m afraid , will get into anything with any girl !
you have a lot of energy for a dead man , mr bond .
you are james bond , aren' t you ?
i am so very pleased to meet you , bond san .
i really am .
permit me to introduce myself .
my name is tanaka .
please call me tiger .
if you' re tanaka , how do you feel about me ?
i ... love you .
i' m glad we got that out of the way .
i' d like you to examine these as soon as possible .
they' re from osato' s safe .
this is an order for naval stores .
500 kilos of butter , 50 containers of lox .
what is lox ?
an american name for smoked salmon .
but it' s also the technical name for liquid oxygen .
which makes rocket fuel .
very interesting .
yes .
we must go .
the journey out will be more dignified than the journey in .
that wouldn' t be difficult .
i' d like that negative enlarged .
ok .
my private train .
i never travel in the streets of tokyo .
in my position , it would be most unwise .
very convenient .
i imagine that your mr m in london has a similar arrangement .
m ?
oh yes , but of course .
then the girl in the white sports car' s one of us .
aki ?
yes .
very competent .
domo arigato .
dozo .
do you like japanese sake , or would you prefer vodka martini ?
oh , no .
i like sake .
especially when it' s served at the correct temperature .
98 . 4 fahrenheit , like this is .
for a european , you are exceptionally cultivated .
we' il see the photograph you found .
good .
a ship and a strip of land .
it could be anywhere .
my men found a microdot on the paper .
enlarge !
it says , ' photograph taken by female american tourist from coastal vessel . '
' the woman has been liquidated as a routine precaution . '
can we see the photograph again ?
of course .
they killed an innocent tourist for taking this ?
can you make it bigger ?
ning po .
check motor vessel ning po .
full details .
all recent movements and present whereabouts .
what' s that on the left ?
focus on the left !
ama .
diving girls .
can you identify that coastline ?
given time , yes .
who is the head of osato chemicals ?
mr osato .
can you arrange an appointment with him tomorrow ?
of course .
but tonight , consider my house yours .
including all of my possessions , naturally .
my friend , now you take your first civilised bath .
really ?
well , i like the plumbing .
place yourself entirely in their hands , my dear bond san .
rule number one ... is never do anything for yourself when someone else can do it for you .
and number two ?
rule number two : in japan , men always come first .
women come second .
i might just retire to here .
your english girls would never perform this simple service .
i know one or two who might get round to it .
miss moneypenny , perhaps ?
we have our sources , bond san , just like you .
don' t get the soap in my eye , will you ?
i suppose you know what it is about you that fascinates them .
it' s the hair on your chest .
japanese men have beautiful bare skin .
japanese proverb say ,
' bird never make nest in bare tree . '
if henderson' s theory is right , why would a foreign power want to launch missiles from japan ?
because if they were discovered , they could deny responsibility .
especially if some private organisation' s doing the work .
osato ?
perhaps .
mr osato is one of our greatest industrialists .
no , he' s merely a front .
who is big enough ?
spectre .
could be .
now , massage .
which girl do you select ?
i' il settle for this little old lady here .
good choice .
she' s very sexyful .
the last time someone gave me a massage was in hong kong .
but unfortunately ... we had to cut it short .
we were rudely interrupted by a couple of gunmen .
so , we never got around to finishing it .
this time , you shall finish it .
aki .
no one will disturb you tonight .
i think i will enjoy very much serving under you .
mr fisher ?
yes .
this way , please .
thank you .
please come in , mr fisher .
mr osato is expecting you .
thank you .
you are three and a half minutes early .
please be seated .
how do you do , mr fisher ?
how do you do ?
miss grant , my confidential secretary .
hello .
hello .
may we offer you some champagne ?
no , thank you , it' s too early for me .
you' re quite sure ?
quite sure .
i always take a glass in the morning .
you should try it .
it' s bad for your liver .
nonsense , it adds a sparkle to the day .
i' m sure it does .
a dom prignon ' 59 , mr fisher .
sure you won' t change your mind ?
well , if you insist .
please be seated , mr fisher .
thank you .
so , you are the new managing director
of empire chemicals ?
yes .
what happened to williamson ?
williamson ?
he died rather suddenly , poor chap .
ah , so .
from what ?
he fell into a pulveriser at the works .
ah , so .
how shocking .
a very honourable death , all the same .
very .
he gained great face with the company .
i hope you are not taking any risks yourself , mr fisher .
me ?
i never take any risks .
you forgive me for saying so , but ...
i think you are taking one now .
i am ?
you should give up smoking .
cigarettes are very bad for your chest .
mr osato believes in a healthy chest .
really ?
you must tell me what i can do for you .
we' re interested in the bulk buying of fermentation chemicals .
monosodium glutamate and ascorbic acid .
would you like a manufacturing licence ?
yes , very much .
i' il have my sales manager get the quotations and delivery dates for you as soon as possible .
we' il contact you later today at your hotel .
which hotel are you staying at ?
the hilton .
goodbye , mr fisher .
a pleasure to meet you .
a pleasure to meet you , too .
goodbye , miss brandt .
goodbye , mr fisher .
kill him .
get down !
294 here .
tiger , immediate .
come in , 294 .
zero zero is with me .
we are being chased by gunmen , in black sedan .
i' m heading south for highway two .
arrange usual reception , please .
how' s that for japanese efficiency ?
just a drop in the ocean .
zero zero ?
yes , tiger .
ning po is owned by osato chemicals .
that fits .
go on .
vessel now loading in kobe docks .
sailing for shanghai at 5pm this afternoon .
suggest you proceed kobe immediately to look her over .
can we make it ?
yes , just .
proceeding immediately , kobe docks .
tiger , contact m.
tell him to send little nellie .
repeat , little nellie .
suggest she be accompanied by her father .
most urgent .
understood ?
understood .
condensation : ice cold .
liquid oxygen .
get out of here .
contact tanaka .
i' m not leaving you .
tell him to keep that ship shadowed .
go now .
take him to number 1 1 .
wake him up .
are you finished ?
where am l ?
you' re in my cabin on the ning po .
leave him to me now .
wait in there .
and shut the door .
i' ve got you now .
enjoy yourself .
who are you working for ?
empire chemicals , you know that .
do all their people carry guns ?
when they' re abroad , yes .
and why were you snooping around the docks ?
i like ships .
and i used to be a sailor .
you are a liar .
do you know what this is ?
i' d rather not .
plastic surgeons call it a dermatome .
they use it to slice off skin .
i hope you won' t force me to use it .
now , what' s a nice girl like you doing in a place like this ?
i have a confession to make .
what ?
actually , i' m a spy .
i know that .
i suppose you know that industrial secrets are big business ?
i' ve stolen osato' s new process for making monosodium glutamate .
and ...
well , it' s worth $300, 000 .
so ?
i' il split it with you if you' il get me out of here and back to tokyo .
that' s a nice offer .
how about it ?
i' m afraid not .
why ?
osato would kill me .
we could fly to europe tomorrow , you and l .
the things i do for england .
now , you are going to need some very close ... protection tonight in tokyo because ... well , that' s when they' il try and get at you .
you' il need the best man we' ve got .
and who do you suggest ?
well , me .
i' m afraid i have another appointment tonight , mr fisher .
i' m awfully sorry to leave you ... but i have to get off .
chasing girls will be the end of you , bond san , i have told you before .
he didn' t chase her .
he did it so i could get away .
he wouldn' t touch that horrible girl .
would you ?
heaven forbid .
any progress ?
yes .
we identified the coastline in the photograph .
it is an island called matsu , on the direct route between kobe and shanghai .
we shadowed the ning po in a helicopter .
did it stop at the island ?
i think so .
it was a very dark night .
impossible to see her all the time .
but we know she stopped somewhere .
look at these .
that one we took last night .
and that one , early this morning .
notice , please , the water line .
you' re right .
fully laden here and empty here .
i want to take a fast look at the island now .
has little nellie arrived yet ?
yes , and her father .
ah , welcome to japan , dad .
is my little girl hot and ready ?
look , 007 , i' ve had a long and tiring journey , probably to no purpose .
i' m in no mood for your juvenile quips .
i have much curiosity , bond san .
what is little nellie ?
she' s a wonderful girl .
very small , quite fast .
can do anything .
just your type .
a toy helicopter ?
no , it' s certainly not a toy !
you' il see .
we' ve made some improvements since you used her last .
i' il give you the drill .
this is only for children .
don' t use it !
take my helicopter instead .
right .
now pay attention .
two machine guns , fixed .
synchronised to what ?
100 yards , using incendiaries and high explosives .
two rocket launchers ,
forward firing on either side .
fine .
now , these fire heat seeking air to air missiles .
60 a minute .
good .
flame guns .
two of ' em .
firing astern .
what range ?
80 yards .
two smoke ejectors next door .
aerial mines .
now remember , use them only when directly above target .
that' s about the lot .
you know the rest .
yes .
cine camera .
tanaka , listen in on 410 megacycles .
good luck !
i' il contact you when i get over the island .
be careful , bond san !
hello , base one .
i' m over the island and the fishing village .
nothing to report .
we' il keep listening .
hello , base one .
there' s nothing here but volcanoes .
understood .
carry on .
hello , base one .
listening .
little nellie got a hot reception .
four big shots made improper advances , but she defended her honour with great success .
heading for home .
do not come home .
russian space shot imminent .
proceed vector4 6 degrees and await instructions .
understood ?
roger and out .
clear the area .
clear the area .
prepare for reception .
prepare for reception .
radar blackout is now complete .
radar blackout is now complete .
moscow radio' s already saying we did it .
the president' s called a press conference for 2pm .
he' il deny emphatically we were involved .
but can we prove it ?
of course not .
no one will believe the russians did it .
now they' il use the excuse to shoot down our next jupiter .
houston to washington .
we followed him for one orbit , now he' s offthe screen .
that means he' s coming down .
yeah , but where ?
some place in russia .
it has to be .
the british theory about japan is nonsense .
forget japan .
i agree .
we' ve re photographed every square inch .
ventilator fans to full power .
open all air ducts .
area safe to enter .
all crews to stations .
all air ducts to normal .
air ducts opened .
close crater .
closing crater .
fire guards to station .
ventilator fans to normal .
open shutters .
reception complete .
withdraw captive spaceship .
guards to stations .
remove the prisoners .
i shall be in my apartment .
i may send for you later .
i must congratulate you , gentlemen , upon your superb equipment .
we congratulate you , sir , upon the way you handle it .
our clients are satisfied with the progress so far ?
my government is quite satisfied .
good .
hans !
you will see that my piranha fish get very hungry .
they can strip a man to the bone in 30 seconds .
i have decided to ask for a little money in advance .
i want the sum of 100 million dollars , in gold bullion , deposited in our account in buenos aires .
our agreement states no money should be paid until war has broken out between russia and the united states .
this is extortion .
extortion is my business .
go and think it over , gentlemen .
i' m busy .
osato and number 1 1 , report now .
an unknown englishman was in your office the other day .
correct , number one .
do you know what gun this is ?
walther ppk .
only one person we know uses this sort of gun .
james bond .
but bond is dead .
it was in all the newspapers .
rubbish .
bond is alive .
unless you killed him , mr osato ?
don' t tell me you let him go .
i gave number 1 1 the strictest orders to eliminate him .
and did she ?
she failed .
you should have killed him .
you had plenty of opportunity .
this organisation does not tolerate failure .
i know , but you see , i ...
go !
well ?
osato !
kill bond !
now !
yes , number one .
yes .
yes , yes .
hello .
bad news from outer space .
yes , i heard it .
now the russians are accusing the americans .
next time it will be war .
we' il have to get down to the volcanoes .
i agree .
we' il also need a company of first rate men .
do you have any commandos here ?
i have much , much better .
ninjas .
top secret , bond san .
this is my ninja training school .
ninjas ?
the art of concealment and surprise .
this must develop very fast reflex actions .
and spiritual strength .
now , we will see some modern ninjas .
my plan is this .
i make a base on the ama island .
100 of my ninjas will slide in unseen .
they will be workers and fishermen .
what about me ?
later .
but for the moment , these will interest you .
rocket guns .
very powerful .
see the holes in the back for jet propulsion .
it' s a fine gun .
all rocket guns .
this is our special baby rocket .
very useful for people who smoke too many cigarettes , like you .
accurate up to 30 yards .
very neat .
it can save your life .
you sound like a commercial .
what' s the plan for me ?
first , you become a japanese .
second , you train hard and quickly to become a ninja like us .
and third , to give you extra special cover , you take a wife .
regretfully impossible .
you must marry ama girl .
one who is known on the island .
is she pretty ?
she has a face like a pig .
to hell with that idea .
but this is duty .
the girl i have chosen is an agent of mine .
but first , you must become japanese .
eyepieces to hera .
why don' t you just dye the parts that show ?
konbanwa .
konbanwa .
tiger said , from now on , you must do everything japanese style .
everything ?
good for tiger .
i' m ...
i ...
i ...
aki !
i' m ...
she' s dead .
poisoned .
tiger , we must get to that island .
you' re almost ready .
just two more days ' training .
you killed him .
yeah , he tried to kill me .
this man is a stranger from outside .
it' s lucky we' re getting out of here .
tomorrow you will be a poor japanese worker , with humble japanese wife .
yeah , with a face like a pig .
my men are already ashore .
all over the island .
we have four days left .
it is not much time .
this is my house .
my friend has made us some food .
do you live here alone ?
yes .
my parents are dead .
sit down , please .
oysters .
is this the only room there is ?
yes .
that is your bed .
i shall sleep over there .
we' re supposed to be married .
think again , please .
you gave false name to priest .
but we must keep up appearances !
we' re on our honeymoon .
no honeymoon .
this is business .
i won' t need these .
bond san .
what' s wrong ?
the americans have changed the launching date .
the countdown has already started .
the president has given a last warning to the russians .
when does it go up ?
tonight , midnight .
our time .
did your men search the island ?
yes .
there is nothing but volcanoes .
everything is so normal around here .
nothing happens .
one thing has happened .
yesterday an ama girl rowed her boat into ryuzaki .
ryuzaki ?
it is a big cave on the mainland .
and when her boat floated out again , she was dead .
was that the funeral we saw yesterday ?
yes .
how did she die ?
nobody knows .
can you take me to this cave ?
yes .
we' il slip away from the fishing fleet in the morning .
all right ?
now , where is this cave ?
it' s straight across .
the cave is over there .
gas .
get over the side .
quick !
phosgene gas , to keep the visitors away .
did you notice the sulphur on the walls ?
the yellow ?
yes .
it was once an underground outlet for the volcanic lava .
there must be a long tunnel .
miles of it .
it leads all the way , right up to the top .
that' s where we have to go .
can you make it ?
of course .
it' s business .
good .
may i rest a moment ?
surely .
it' s hard work .
some honeymoon !
it' s going down ! lnto the volcano !
heliport to position .
the honeymoon' s over .
come on .
this volcano isn' t active , is it ?
it never has been .
not in my lifetime .
there' s been some terrific heat here recently .
what happened to the helicopter ?
it' s down there somewhere .
come on .
stand by .
mark .
stand by for ten second countdown .
10 , 9 , 8 ...
all units worldwide will remain at readiness so long as the spacecraft is in orbit . .. 3 , 2 , 1 .
ignition .
this is it , gentlemen .
all we can do now is wait and pray .
is that deep ?
they usually are very .
it' s metal !
wait here .
